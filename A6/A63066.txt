A COMMENTARY OR EXPOSITION Upon the BOOKS of Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job and
Psalms.

WHEREIN The TEXT is Explained, some Controversies are Discussed, sundry Cases
of Conscience are Cleared, and many Remarkable Matters hinted, that had by
former Interpreters been pretermitted.

In all which diverse other Texts of Scripture, which occasionally occur, are
fully Opened, and the whole so intermixed with pertinent Histories, as will
yield both pleasure and profit to the Judicious Reader.

By JOHN TRAPP, M. A. once of Christ-church in Oxford, now Pastor of Weston
upon Avon in Gloucestershire.

LUKE 24.44, 45. And he said unto them, These are the words which I spoke unto
you while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were
written in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning
me.

Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the Scripture.

LONDON, Printed by T. R. and E. M. for Thomas Newberry at the three Golden
Lions in Cornhil, near the Royal Exchange, and Joseph Barber at the Holy Lamb
in the New Rents in St. Paul's Churchyard. 1657.

To the Worshipful his much Honored Friend, EDWARD LEIGH of RVSHIL-HALL in
Staffordshire, Esquire, Master of ARTS, of both UNIVERSITIES
HONORED SIR,
BEsides the much help, I confess, (and not now the first time See my Notes on
the New Test passim.
) to have had from your learned Lucubrations already extant, those many real
Courtesies lately done me (a mere stranger) in mine eldest son, (whom you
have freely beneficed, and fairly encouraged,) call hard upon me for a
grateful acknowledgement. And forasmuch (as like another Nicias,) you are known
to be (...), Yea, Stobaeus Sermon. 117.
(as that renowned Richard de Bury) Extatico quodam librorum amore potenter
abreptus, so that you may well say, Hi^fuit episc. Dunelmenfis. An. Dom 1333.
as that Emperor once did of himself, Quidam equis, hi avibus, nonulli feris
delectantur, Ego vero inde usque a pueritia librorum cupiditate arsi. Julian
ep. ad Ecdicium.
I cannot bethink me of a fitter Patron then your worthy self, nor yet of a
better Present then this of a Book; beseeching you to own it and honor it with
your kind acceptance, as a token of my true respects, and a testimony of my
cordial thankfulness. I need not here, for an Apology, tell you Sir, what
Seneca says, There Is no Book so bad, but some Commodity may be gotten by it.
Let it be (for me) a praise proper to Hippocrates, that in his Aphorisms,
there is (...). Let Scaliger say of Virgil, (and Lipsius as much of Tacitus)
Ecujus ore nil teniere excidit. Aristotle's Rhetoric, says one, is sufficient
to make both a Scholar and an honest man. His Politics Tully calls Aureum
flumen or ationis, for the purity of the style, and preciousnesse of the
matter. Averroes admireth and extolleth him above measure, in whatsoever he
has written. And yet others, no less judicious, deem that his deep Theoremes
of Philosophy, as they make men learned, so seldom better, and oftentimes
worse, mere Atheists. Sure it is, that compared with the holy Scriptures, they
are but straminea candela, a rush-candle, that yields but a small light, and
is quickly out. To the Law therefore, and to the Testimony, says that
Evangelical Prophet, (that is, to the Old Testament and the New, as some sense
it) If any speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in
them: As if any, either by speaking or writing bring the least light to these
sacred Oracles, (Quae and latent and lucent) They are not to be defrauded of
their due commendation. This you have done (worthy Sir) in all your Theological
Treatises (which are auro contra non cari) Your elaborate Annotations on the
New Testament especially. On the Old Testament also we hope to see you shortly;
and are so far from censuring you for thrusting your Sickle into our Harvest,
that we all highly accept and applaud your learned Labors; heartily wishing
you length of days, and help from Heaven, for the completing of so good a
work. Bern.
Deus praecepit nobis, ut discamus non argutias Platonis, nec versutias
Aristotelis, sed doctrinam Filii Dei. Hereunto therefore we do humbly crave and
call for your utmost furtherance, which shall be nothing at all to your
hinderance at the last: for beside the reward of eternal life, assured you by
Christ our (...), Bodin Theat. Not. p. 9.
Scientiarum ea vis est ac natura, ut quo plus doceas, ac alteri de tuo
largiare, eo ditior ac doctior fias; there is no loss in laying out your
talent. Your much desired Commentaries, now in the Press, (as is reported) and
which you are yet further preparing for the public, will be most welcome to the
world; and I wish they may take as well as did Aretius his Examen Theologicum,
printed twelve times in three years. As for these, or any other of mine, let
them veil, and strike sale to yours, wherever they meet them, and let me be
ever reckoned, among many others,

Welford, Sept. 8. 1656. SIR, An Admirer of your indefatigable industry and
rare abilities, JOHN TRAPP.

Viro Ornatissimo, Affini amantissimo doctissimoque, D' JOHANNI TRAPPO.
NImirum solvenda fides. At quomodo carmen
Panxerit exaret cui vena, and Musula muta est?
Qui Consorte tori (qua non praestantior unquam
Et qua ter fueram quatuor per lustra beatus.)
Erepta, Niobes possim nunc esse maritus,
Expectes ut laeta canam? Lapidescere coepi
(Proh dolor!) infelix. At felicissimus idem,
Quod sic Vxori Monumentum fio sepultae.
Vt praestem promissa tamen (quae debita dicunt,
Et solvi par esse,) ciens in carmina Musam,
Exigis. An Lapis emittat, charissime, vocem?
Imo, ais, hoc usu venit ut Monumenta loquantur.
Vicisti, experiar. Doleot antum esse dolorem
Vt calamum impediat cupientem promere lauds
Et meritis se implere tuis. Tu voce diserta
Me prope confectum reficis, prohibesque sepulcro.
Tu mea damna doles, and tanquam propria defles.
Meque, mihi ereptae, quaete sic jure colebat,
Dum recolis raros mores, solaris abunde.
Sic facis and Scriptis. O quae mihi Pharmaca praebent
Quae prius edideras, queis Sacra Oracula pandis,
Et quibus ut grandi Thesauro Ecclesia gaudet!
Dicere sunt ea visa, Hinc lucem and Pocula Sacra
Hinc pete qui impense luges, mentemque serena,
Ecce profundemus solatia summa jacenti.
Haec quaque quae celeri video jam subdita Prelo,
Vt mihi praevideo pariter Medicamina, cunctis
Sic and Symmystis gratissima credo futura.
Altera jam Pentas facilem se praebet, and offert
Quas modo condiderat dias ditissima gazas.
Gestat and Ornamenta quibus non antea fulsit.
Cultior incedis solito divine Sacerdos,
Tuque acris Princeps, and tu fidissime custos
Virginis egregiae, quae utroque misella Parente
Orba, in te Patruele utrumque (o fausta!) parentem
Repperit. Ostentant vestri nunc quanta libelli!
Jobe, tua sumpsit sibi jam nova cornua Moses,
Quod tibi sors praesens melior fit sort priori.
Mulcet inaudit a mentes dulcedine Psaltes.
Jam nil triste sonat Testudo Regia: at ode
Quae modo lugubris jacuit nunc laeta triumphat,
Art tua haee facile praestas, clarissime Trappe.
Cui, vite eximia sobole octupliei que beato,
Nestoreos exopto annos, illamque salutem
Quae mihi dum vixi fuit, at cum Conjuge (vitae
Quae mihi vita fuit) dulci cum Conjuge fugit.

A COMMENTARY OR EXPOSITION Upon the BOOK of EZRA.
CHAP. I Verse 1. Now in the first year of Cyrus King of Persia,]
Ver. 1. NOw] Heb. And; for the former History, recorded in the Chronicles, is
continued by Ezra that ready Scribe, and perfect in the Law, Chap. 7.6. Yet not
so prompt or perfect can I deem him, as that he should, by memory, restore the
Bible that was burnt, together with the Temple, Irenae. Tertuil. Clem. Alexi
Hieron. Aug. Eusebius. Alsted. Chron page 267. Acts and Mon.
by the Babylonians. And yet that was the opinion of many Ancients, grounded
upon some passages in that Apocryphal Esdras. We read also of one Johannes
Gatius Ciphaleditanus, who, out of the vain confidence of his learning and
memory, was wont to give out, that if the Holy Scripture should be lost out of
the world, he would not doubt (by Gods grace) to restore it whole again. Of
Cranmer indeed (a far better man, and a profounder Divine) it is storied, that
he had got most of the New Testament by heart. And of Beza, that being above
eighty years of age, he could say perfectly without book, and Greek Chapter in
Saint Paul's Epistles. M. Leigh. A^ not. on John 5.39.


In the first year] Heb. In the one year. The Hebrews often use One for First. So
do also the Apostles in Greek, Matthew. 28.1. John 20.1, 19.1 Cor. 16.2. Rev.
6.1. One, being the first number; neither was it without a mystery that
Pythagoras bade his Scholars ever to have respect, (...): as Moses also his,
saying, Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord, Deuteronomy. 6.4.

Of Cyrus] Heb. Coresh, so named by God above an hundred years before he was
born, See the like Josiah, 1 Ki^ 13.3.
Isay 40.28. and so honored by the Persians (as the founder of their Monarchy)
that they liked the better of all that were Hawk-nosed, like unto him. The
Persian word signifies a Lord, or great Prince, as Hen. Stephanus notes: and
thence the Greeks have their (...), Authority, (...), Lord: and We our word
Sir, as some will have it. Plutarch in Artaxerxes says, that the Persians call
the Sun Cyrus. And it may very well be so, Peacham.
for the Hebrews also call the Sun (...) Cheres, from its glistering
brightness.

King of Persia] So he had been above twenty years before this, and done many
great exploits: but this was the first year of his Empire, of his Cosmocratie,
of the Monarchy translated from the Babylonians to the Persians. The greatest
Kingdoms have their times and their turns, their rise and their ruin, when
they shall live by fame only. Persia, having often changed her Masters since
Cyrus, remains a flourishing Kingdom to this day; but wholly Mohammedan.
Turk. Hist. ^ol. 5.
Which abominable superstition the Turks received from them, when in the year
1030. they won that Country under their Sultan Tangrolipix. Where it is hard
to say (says mine Author) whether nation lost more, the Persians by the loss
of so great a Kingdom, Blounts Voy. into the Leu. page 81.
or the Turks by embracing so great a vanity. To this day they acknowledge the
Persians better Mahometans then themselves, which makes the Turks far better
soldiers upon the Christian then upon the Persian.

That the Word of the Lord] For, it was He that spoke by the mouth of his holy
Prophets, Luke 1.70. and his word cannot be broken, Psalm. 31.5.
John 10.35. for he is the God of Amen, asthe Prophet David somewhere calls
him; and all his promises are the issue of a most faithful and right Will void
of all insincerity and falsehood, Prove. 8.8.

By the mouth of Jeremy] That admirable Preacher (as Keckerman calls him)
that most eminent Prophet (as another) with whose writings, De Rhet. Eccles
about this very restoration, Daniel consulted, and therehence collected, that
the time was come, Dan. 9.2. which put him upon that heavenly prayer: for he
knew that Gods promises must be put in suit; and and it was to him that the
Angel afterward said, I came for thy word, Dan. 10.14. God will come,
according to his promise, but he will have his peoples prayers lead him. This
liberty here granted to the Jews, after so long captivity, was the fruit of
many prayers, founded upon the promise, Jer. 25.12. and 29.10.

Might be fulfilled] As indeed it was exactly by the death of Belshazzar slain
by Cyrus, who succeeded him, Dan. 5.30. In that night was Belshazzar slain,
because then exactly the seventy years were ended. So, for the same reason it
is noted, Exodus 12.40, 41. that at midnight the firstborn of Egypt were
slain, because just then the four hundred or four hundred and thirty years
foretold were expired. So punctual is God in keeping his word. It is not here,
as with men, A day breaks no square, etc. for he never fails at his time.

The Lord stirred up the spirit] It was the mighty and immediate work of God
(in whose hand are the hearts of all, both Kings and Captives, Lords and
Losels) to bring this wise and great Prince, in the very first entrance into
his Monarchy, before things were fully settled, to dismiss so great and so
united a people (in respect of their custom and religion) and so given to
insurrection (as was generally held) into their own Country, with such a
fair and full Patent. This was the Lords own work, and it was justly
mavelous in the eyes of his people; who could hardly believe their own eyes,
but were for a while, like them that dream. Then was their mouth filled with
laughter, and their tongue with singing, etc. Psalm. 126.1, 2. Then was the
great power and goodness of God, in stirring up Cyrus to do this,
acknowledged. Then also was the Kings clemency and courtesy no less cried up
and magnified then was that of Flaminius the Roman General at Athens, where for
delivering them from servitude, he was little less then deified: Or, that of
our Queen Elizabeth, who for her merciful returning home certain Italians
that were taken prisoners in the eighty eight Invasion, was termed Saint
Elizabeth, by some at Venice: Whereof one told the Lord Carleton (afterward
Viscount Dorchester) being there Ambassador, that although he were a Papist,
yet he would never pray to any other Saint, but that Saint Elizabeth.

That he made Proclamation] Heb. He caused a voice to passe] sc. by his
Messengers and Ministers. The Posts went out, being hastened by the Kings
commandment, Esth. 3.15. even those Angarii. The Lord Christ also proclaiming
liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound,
Esaias 61.1. causes his Word to run and to be glorified, to spread like a
Sun-beame, as Eusebius says the Gospel did at first; to be carried as on
Eagles wings, or on Angels wings, as it was thorough all Christendom, when
Luther first sent forth his book De Captivitate Babylonica, of the Babylonish
Captivity.

And put it also in writing] That it might be posted up, and every where
published. Vox audita perit: littera scripta manet, Christ has written for us
also the great things of his Law: And should they then be counted a strange
thing? Hos. 8.12. See the Notes there. His Gospel likewise he has written to
you that believe on the name of the Son of God, 1 John 5.13. and ponder his
Passion especially which is therefore so particularly set down by four
faithful Witnesses, Sphinx Philos.
that men may get it written not on the nails of their hands (as one once did)
but upon the tables of their hearts, there to abides as a perpetual picture;
Non scripta solum, sed and sculpta, as He said, that we therein beholding, as
in a glass, the love of our Lord, might be changed into the same image, till
our hearts became a very lump of love to him who loved us, and washed us from
our sins in his own blood, and made us Kings and Priests unto God and his
Father, Rev. 1.5, 6.

Ver. 2. The Lord God of heaven has given me] This good language Cyrus might
well learn of Daniel, who flourished under his reign, Dan. 6.28. and probably
acquainted him with the prophesies that went before of him, Isa. 44.28. and
45.1. Jaddus the High Priest did the like (many years after) to Alexander the
Great: who not only thereupon spared the Jews, but highly honored them, as
Josephus relates. Here then we see this Potentate of the earth gives unto the
Lord the glory due unto his Name, Psalm. 29.1, 2. acknowledging him the blessed
and only Potentate, 1 Timothy 6.16. One that both is in the heavens, and also
does whatsoever he pleases, both in heaven and in earth, Psalm. 115.3. and
135.6. The God of heaven, says He, has given me all the Kingdoms of the
earth. This was far better then that of Alexander the Great, whom when
Lysippus had pictured looking up to heaven with this Posie, Iuppiter asserui
terram mihi, tu assere coelum, etc. Alexander was so delighted with it, that he
proclaimed that none should take his picture but Lysippus. Plin. lib. 6. cap.
16.


All the Kingdoms of the earth] i. e. Many of them, so that he was (...) a
mighty Monarch, an absolute Emperor. But to be (...) sole Lord of the whole
world, was never yet granted to any: though the great Cham of Cataia is
reported to cause his Trumpets to be founded, every day as soon as he has
dined, Heyl. Geog.
in token that he gives leave to other Princes of the earth (whom he supposes
to be his vassals) to go to dinner. And the proud Spaniard (who affects to be
Catholic Monarch) was well laughed at by Sir Francis Drake and his company,
Camd. Elis.
for his device of a Pegasus flying out of a Globe of the earth set up in the
Indies with this Motto -- totus non sufficit orbis. But he affects an
universal Monarchy: and so perhaps did Cyrus, which makes him here speak so
largely.

And he has charged me] Et ipse commisit mihi, so Junius rendereth it. The
word signifies to visit one, either for the better or the worse. But according
to the Chaldee and Syriack use, it signifies to charge or command, as it is
here, and 2 Chon. 36.22. fitly rendered. But how knew Cyrus this charge of
Almighty God; otherwise then by books? Like as Daniel (who probably showed him
those Prophesies of Esaias concerning him) understood by Jeremy 25.12. and 29.10.
that the seventy years captivity were accomplished: and by Ezekiel, chap. 31.1,
2, 3. etc. (which he had read, likely, and revolved) he was the better able to
give a right interpretation of Nebuchadnezzars dream, Dan. 4.

To build him an house at Jerusalem] i. e. To rebuild that which had been once
built by Solomon (whence Hegesippus, not having the Hebrew tongue, will have
Jerusalem so named quasi (...) Solomon's Temple) a stately house indeed, and
one of the seven wonders of the world. For albeit it was but one hundred and
twenty foot long, and forty foot broad; whereas the Temple at Ephesus was two
hundred forty and five foot long, and two hundred and twenty foot broad: Yet
for costly and choice materials, for curious and exact workmanship, for
spiritual employment, and for mystical signification, never was there the like
edifice in the world. And happy had it been for Cyrus, if laying aside all his
warlike expeditions and achievements, he had wholly applied himself to the
building of this holy house, and to the study of those things, that there he
might have learned for his souls health.

Jerusalem which is in Judah] Jerusalem was part of it in Judah, and part in
the tribe of Benjamin. The house here mentioned ( viz. the Temple) stood in
Benjamin, as was foretold it should by Moses, four hundred and forty years
before it was first built by Solomon, Deuteronomy. 33.12. And of Benjamin he said, The
beloved of the Lord, that is, Benjamin his darling, shall dwell in safety by
him, and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between
his shoulders, that is, betwixt those two mountains, Moriah and Sion, wherein
the Temple was built. Now because Benjamin was the least of all the tribes of
Israel, and because so much of it as lay within Judah ( Josh: 19.1, 9.) was
comprised under Judah (1 Kings 11.13.) therefore is the Temple here said to be
in Jerusalem which is in Judah. Hereby also this Jerusalem in Judah is
distinguished from any other Jerusalem, if there were any place in the world so
called besides. We read of Pope Sylvester the second (who sold his soul to the
Devil for the Popedom) that saying Mass in a certain Church in Rome, Funcc.
Chronol. Jacob. Reu. page 109.
called Jerusalem, he fell suddenly into a Fever, whereof he died, the Devil
claiming his own: For the bargain betwixt them was, that he should continue
Pope, till he sang Mass in Jerusalem: and now intellexit se a Diabolo
amphibolia vocis circumventum: little dreamt the Pope of any other Jerusalem
but this in Judah, and this cost him his life, Lib. 5. cap. 17.
Anno Dom. 1003. Eusebius tells us that Montanus the Haeresiarch called his
Pepuza and Tymium (two pelting parishes in Phrygia) Jerusalem; as if they had
been the only Churches in the world. Hist. David. George. p. 3.
Hofman the Anabaptist had the like conceit of Strasburg in Germany; and Becold
of Munster; both which places they called the new Jerusalem.

Ver. 3. Who is there among you of all his people] Many there were among them
that affirmed deeply of being the people of God, who yet (tanquam monstra
marina) passed by this Proclamation with a deaf ear; and preferring haram
domesticam arae dominicae a swinesty before a Sanuctary, chose rather to abide
in Babylon, and there to dwell amongst plants and hedges, 1 Chronicles. 4.23. making
pots for the Kings garden, then to go up to Jerusalem. So that, besides this O
yes, by the King, God was feign to cry, Ho, Ho, come forth and flee from the
Land of the North: Deliver thy self, O Zion, that dwell with the daughter of
Babylon, Zech. 2.6, 7. Arise ye, and depart: for this is not your rest, because
it is polluted: it shall destroy you even with a sore destruction, Mic. 2.10.
Look how the Eagle has much ado to get her young ones out of the nest,
pricking and beating them with her wings and talons; so was it here: and
neither so could the Lord prevail with the most of them, being as loath to
depart, as Lot was out of Sodom, vel canis ab uncto cerio, or a dog from a fat
morsel.

His God be with him] And then he needs no better company, no greater
happiness: for he is sure of a confluence of all comforts, of all that heart
can wish, or need require. Tua praesentia, Domine, Laurentio ipsam craticulam
fecit dulcem, Aug.
says an Ancient, Thy presence sweeteneth all our occurrences. This was
therefore a good wish of King Cyrus; neither did he therein any disservice to
himself; for God has promised to bless those that bless any of his, Genesis
12.3. and not to let a good wish to such go unrewarded, 2 Cor. 13.9.

Let him go up and build, etc.] As God had charged him, verse 2. so does he
them. And it is as if he should have said with that Father. Unless I stir up
your hearts, as the Lord has done mine, unless I lay Gods charge upon you to
set strenuously upon this service of his, Bern.
Vobis erit damnosum, mihi periculosum. Timeo itaque damnum vestrum, timeo
damnationem meam, si tacuero. If now you go not up upon so great encouragement,
God will surely bemeet with you.

He is the God] The only true God, John 17.3. none like him, Mic. 7.18. The
Lord your God is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, a great God, a mighty and a
terrible, Deuteronomy. 10.17. Is it not fit therefore that he have a Temple, a place
of divine worship, which the Heathens deny not to their dunghill-deities?

Which is in Jerusalem] That City of the great King, where he kept his Court,
and afforded his special presence, not of grace only in his Ordinances, but of
glory also sometimes in his holy Temple, 2 Chronicles. 5.14. as in another heaven.

Ver. 4. And whosoever remains in any place where he sojourneth] Heb.
Gar-shom. A name that Moses gave his eldest son borne in his banishment; for
he said I have been a stranger in a strange land, Exodus 2.22. These poor
captives had been longer so then Moses in Midian, and met with more hard
measure, Psalm. 137.1, 8. But as those who are borne in hell know no other
heaven (as the Proverb is) so fared it not with a few of these; loath to be at
the pains, and run the hazard of a voyage to the holy Land. A little with ease
is held best. Let us who are strangers here, haste homeward, heavenward. Some
of these poor Jews had a mind to return; but wanted means. For these
necessitous people the King takes care and course here, that they be supplied
and set forward on their journey after a godly sort, or worthy of God, (as
Saint John phraseth it, 3 John 6.) who else will require it.

Let the men of his place] Whether Jews or Proselytes, brethren by race,
grace, or place only.

Help him wish silver] Heb. Give him a lift out of the dust, as Jobs friends
did him off the dunghill: as Joseph did his brethren when he filled their bags,
(...).
and returned them their moneys; And as all Christians are bound and bid to
support or shore up their weaker brethren, 1 Thessalonians. 5 14.

With silver an with gold] These are notable good levers at a dead lift in this
present world, where money bears the mastery, and answers all things:
Eccles. 10.14.
a satisfactory answer it gives to whatsoever is desired, or demanded: He that
helps a man therefore in his necessity with silver and gold, is a friend
indeed. Let a man make God his friend, and then (says Eliphaz,) the Almighty
shall be his gold, and he shall have plenty of silver, Job 22.25. Jacob shall
be sure of so much as shall bring him to his journeys end, a sufficiency (if
not a superfluity) of all things, needful to life and godliness.

And with goods] Heb. Recush (whence happily our English words Riches and Cash)
chattels, movables, gathered substance, as the word signifies, which whosoever
he was that first called substance, was utterly mistaken; since wisdom only
(that is, godliness) is durable substance, Prove. 8.21. Wealth is but a
semblance, Proverbs 23.5. 1 Corinthians. 7.31. And he that first called Riches
Goods, Psalm. 4.6.
was a better husband then Divine. But it may be thought, the most are such
husbands: since the common cry is, Who will show us any good? a good booty, a
good bargain, a good beast, etc.? That one thing necessary that is both Bonum
hominis, The good of man, Micah 6.84 and Totum hominis, The whole of man,
Eccles. 12.13. lies wholly neglected by the most.

And with beasts] Those most serviceable creatures both ad esum and ad usum,
for food and other uses, as Sheep, Horses, Camels, Dromedaries, swift, patient,
painful.

Besides the free-will-offering] Which the King presumes all Gods free-hearted
people (Voluntieres, every soul of them, Psalm. 110.3.) will be most forward
unto, See Lev. 5.6, 12. and 14.10, 21, 30. In Psalm. 1.
in so good a work, so acceptable a service. God straineth upon no man, Exodus
25.2. and 35.5. Lex quaerit voluntarios, The Law calls for Volunteires, says
Ambrose. See Esaias 56.6. and 2 Cor. 8.12. and 9.7. and learn to come off
roundly and readily in works of Piety and Charity: for else all is lost; since
Virtus nolentium nulla est, unwilling service is nothing set by.

That is in Jerusalem] This City he so often names, Psalm. 137:6.
that he may seem delighted with the very mention of it: and to be of the same
mind with those pious captives, that vowed to prefer Jerusalem (that joy of
the whole earth) before their chief joy, to make it ascend above the head of
their joy, as the Hebrew has it.

How then should it cheer up our hearts to think of heaven, and that we are
written among the living in Jerusalem, Esaias 4.3? fellow-citizens with the
Saints, and of the household of heaven, Ephesians. 2.19?

Verse 5. Then rose up the chief of the fathers] Those, who are therefore
crowned and chronicled in the next Chapter. Those Magnates Magnites, that drew
on others by their example. Those Viri gregis, he-goats before the flocks, men
of public places and authority, active for Reformation, who hearkened to that
divine call, Jer. 50.8. Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out
of the land of the Caldeans, and be as the hegoats before the flocks. These
Nobles arose, being rowsed and raised by that Noble Spirit of God, Psalm. 51.12.
that Kingly spirit, the Chaldee rendereth it; such as was found in Araunah that
famous Jebusite, 2 Samuel 24.23. with Zech. 9.7. and is a quickening Spirit in
every good soul, causing them to make riddance, as Baruc did, Nehem. 3.20. Genesis
29. Ambrose.
and to take long strides toward heaven, as Jacob did toward Padan-Aram: for,
Nescit tarda molimina Spiritus sancti gratia. The Spirit of grace knows no
slow paces; Mantuan;
but is quick of dispatch. Up get these Chieftains when once they hear, Surge,
age, Sum Pater, as one said once to the Bishop of Rome, exciting him to make
war upon the Turk.

And the Priests and the Levites] Fit it was that these should be of the first
and forwardest at Temple-work: whose proper employment is was to teach Jacob
Gods judgments, and to put incense before him continually, Deuteronomy, 33.10. to
wait at the Altar, and to be partakers with the Altar, 1 Cor, 9.13.

With all them whose spirit God had raised up] Not of Judah and Benjamin only
(those best of the Tribes, and truest to their Princes and principles) but also
of Ephraim and Manasseh, 1 Chronicles. 9.3. with Ezekiel. 37.16, 17, 21, 22. even as
many of the Israelites, as were acted by Gods Spirit of judgment and of
burning, Isa. 4.4. firing them up to an holy contention in so noble and
necessary a business, and leading them into the land of uprightness, Psalm.
143.10. The fruit of this good Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness
and truth, Ephesians. 5.9. the work of it upon the sons of God who are led by it,
Romans 8.14. is not only an external invitation by the Word and Sacraments, or a
mere moral persuasion ( Cyrus his Proclamation here would have availed but
little with this people, if God had not moved their hearts) but an effectual
drawing of the heart whereby operating irresistibly the sinner is converted:
and whereby cooperating infallibly he persevereth in grace unto the very end,
John 6.44. This conduct of the holy Spirit we must both earnestly beg with
David, Psalm. 14.10. and as carefully observe and obey his motions, as ever
David did the outgoings of God in the tops of the mulberry trees, 1 Chronicles.
14.15. for these are the sound of his goings, and the footsteps of his
Anointed, Psalm. 89.51.

To build the house of the Lord] This was that they aimed at, rather then their
own liberty. Choice and excellent spirits can easily drown all self-respects
in the glory of God. It was the care of those good people in Joels days, that
there might be a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord their God,
whatever became of their own Carcasses, Joel 2.14. And when the daily
sacrifice ceased by the tyranny of Antiochus, they looked upon it as an
abomination of desolation, Dan. 9.27. The Jews at this day are very earnest to
be rebuilding the destroyed Temple at Jerusalem, out of their blind zeal: but
they have neither any Cyrus to encourage them ( Julian the Apostate once did,
in spite to the Christians, but it came to nothing) nor the Spirit of God to
excite them to such an unwarrantable work.

Verse 6. And all they that were about them] Both their countrymen the Jews
(that thought not good to go themselves, or not yet, till they should see
further; there is none so wise as the sluggard, Prove. 26.16.) and others of the
neighborhood: for the Egyptians may lend Jewels to the Israelites, dogs may
lick Lazarus his ulcers, and the earth may help the woman, by opening her
mouth, and swallowing up the stood cast out after her by the Dragon to drown
her, Rev. 12.16.

Strengthened their hands] Which else, for want of such support, would have
hung down, and their feeble knees buckled under them, ere they had come to
their country: neither could they, without such supplies, have so comfortable
carried on the work they went about. For, if wisdom be a defense, or a shadow,
to those that have seen the Sun (as in the former verse) and are scorched
with the hear of it, so is money too, says Solomon, Eccles. 7.12. and though
Wisdom without wealth is good, yet it is better with an inheritance, verse 11.
which is not only an ornament, but an instrument of virtue. When men go on
Virtute duce, comite fortuna, then it is well with them, as it was with good
Josiah, Jer. 22.15, 16. But Agur would not be poor, lest he should be put upon
ill courses, Prove. 30.9. put to his shifts Poor Hagar, when the water was spent
in the bottle, cast the child under the shrubs, Genesis 21.15.

With vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts] See the Note
on Verse 4. These are things that men do not usually so easily part with to
others, till they needs must. Euclio in the Comedian sits abrood upon his heaps
and hoards, and will not be drawn off. Shall Nabal take his bread and his
flesh, and give it to those he knows not, 1 Samuel 25? Misers will as soon part
with their blood as their good whence the Chaldees call their money Dam, that
is, blood. Many a man shows himself like the Cornish-chough, which will steal
a piece of money, and hiding it in some hole, will never help her self or any
other with it afterward. Hermocrates being loath that any man should enjoy his
goods after him, made himself by his Will, heir of his own goods. Athenaeus
tells of one, that at his death devoured many pieces of Gold, and sewed the
rest in his coat, commanding that they should be all buried with him. But these
in the text seem to have been of the race of those Persians spoken of, Isa.
13.17. which regarded not silver, and as for gold they cared not much for it.
Or, if they were Proselytes to the Church, then they had learned (with Tyrus
now also converted) to give over heaping and hoarding of wealth, and therewith
to feed and cloth Gods poor Saints; and so to furnish them for their journey
to their Fathers house, that they may eat sufficiently, and have durable
cleathing, Isa. 23.18. This was Gods work upon their hearts; And Quando
Christus magister, quam cito discirur quod decetur? Augustine.
Whereunto may be added, that Cyrus, who set forth this Edict, as he was an
absolute Sovereigne, (and so his word went for a law) so he was a gracious and
courteous Prince, it a ut Patris nomen meruerit, so that he merited the name
and title of Father of his Country, and might command any thing of them.

And with precious things] Even the very best of the best they had. The word
signifies praestantissimum and pretiosissimum in quocunque genere fructuum,
metallorum, gemmarum, vestium, the choycest and chiefest of all kind of
commodities. Such as Eleazar gave to Rebecca and her brother Genesis 24. and such
as Jehosaphat gave his younger son^, 2 Chronicles. 21.3.
For the purchase of the pearl of price, the wise Merchant makes a thorough
sale of all. Barnabas parts with his lands, Zacheus with his goods, Matthew
with his meat, the Centurion with his money, to build those Synagogues that
wicked Antiochus had thrown down, and these in the Text, with their most
precious things, to reedifie that Temple that Nebuchadnezzar had burnt.

Besides all that was willingly offered] A free will offering then there was
(as verse 4.) brought in by Gods willing people, Psalm. 110.3. that wait for
Gods Law, as Esaias 42.8. and hold with that Ancient, that it is nimis angusta
innocentia, ad legem bonum esse, to do no more service to God then needs must
to get so much grace only as will keep life and soul together, (that is, soul
and hell asunder,) this they judge to be a low and unworthy strain of some
good people. David voweth free-will-offerings often, Psalm. 5.6. 1 Chr. 29, 8, 9.
and could beteeme God a great deal more love and service then he is able to
perform to him. Those good souls, Zach. 8.21. call upon themselves and one
another, 1 Samuel 1.4.21. Luke 2.41, 42:
to be continually going before the Lord, and to seek the Lord of hosts, I
(says each for himself) will go also. Hannah went up with her husband every
year to the Feast: so did the Virgin Mary to the Passover with her Son
Jesus: yet none were expressly commanded so to do but males; and those also
nothing under twenty years of age, as fit to be numbered, Exodus 30.14. So those
amongst us that hear week-day-Sermons, as Mary did, Luke 10.42. and many other
good people in our Saviors days, Luke 19.47, 48. and 21.37, 38. Hereby we
shall show our love, and do a service highly accepted in heaven.

Verse 7. Also Cyrus the King brought forth the vessels] For example to others,
and jussit, and gessit, he did himself what he commanded to be done, and so
became a living Law, a walking Statute. So Justinian would not put the vessels
of the Temple (taken by Titus) and recovered from Gensericus into the public
treasury, but restored them.

Which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth] With profane and sacrilegious hands,
some of these sacred vessels and utensils of the Temple, he had cut in pieces,
2 Kings 24.13. and others he carried away, 2 Chronicles. 36.7. whole and entire.
This he did out of covetousness (that auri sacra fames) and in scorn of all
religion (rather then hatred of the Jewish superstition, or to avenge the
quarrel of Gods Covenant) like as for the same reason his successor Cambyses
destroyed the Egyptian Idols. Virg. Isa. 10.


And had put them] There was a sweet providence in that: to the end that being
there reserved, they might in due time be restored (as here they are) to the
house of God at Jerusalem. And although that was a most unfit place to keep
them in (for what agreement has the Temple of God with Idols?) and Belshazzar
most profanely abused them, 2 Cor. 6.16.
Dan. 5.2. in that drunken feast of his (hence he is called the festival King,
Ezekiel. 21.5. 6.) yet being sanctified again, and dedicated to the true and
first owner, the God of Israel, they might lawful be made use of. Not only
things indifferent abused, may yet be used in the service of God (as those six
water-pots were by our Savior, John 2. though they had been superstitiously
abused for private purification) but also Idolatrous things and places. As
Gideon took the Bullock appointed for Baal and the Grove, and offered the
Bullock with that wood in sacrifice to the Lord, Judge. 6.26. The like the
Bethshemites did by the Philistines Cart and Kine. The Mount of Olives was
shamefully abused to idolatry by Solomon and others, so that it was called The
Mount of corruption, 2 Kings 23.13. and yet was it our Saviors usual Oratory,
or place of Prayer.

In the house of his Gods] Bell and Nebo, Esaias 46.1. These were Babylons chief
gods. The Original of Bell is said to be this: Ninus having made an Image of his
father Belus, all that came to see it were pardoned for all their offenses:
whence in time that Image came to be worshipped, and then afterward a
multitude more; Insomuch as, (...), etc. Hef.
that in Hesiods time the number of Heathenish gods was grown to thirty
thousand. And in China at this day some tell us that there are no fewer then an
hundred thousand Idols.

O curas hominum! O quantum est in rebus inane! (...). etc.
Gods these Mawmets are called here; not because they were so, (for there is
one God only, said Pythagoras, and other Heathens) but because Nebuchadnezzar
falsely held them so. Like as elsewhere the gods of Damascus are said to have
smitten Ahaz, who therefore sacrificed to them, 2 Chronicles. 20.23. not as if those
Idols were any thing in the world, or could do any thing at all to him, Jer.
10.5. 1 Cor. 8.4. but only that he conceited so; and that the devil (who is
(...), as Synesius truly says) abused his credulity.

Ver. 8. Even those did Cyrus King of Persia] so styled, because though he was
Monarch of many Countries, yet Persia was his hereditary Kingdom, and
Persepolis the place of his residence: which great City was afterward burnt by
Alexander the Great, at the motion and by the request of a base harlot.

By the hand of Mithridath the treasurer] Heb. Gizbar; Inde Gaspar, says one.
Mithridates King of Pontus was famous in after-ages, or rather infamous for his
craft in saving himself, Val. Max.
and his cruelty to the Roman Merchants, trading through his territories,
killing fourscore thousand of them with one letter.

And numbered them unto Shezbazzar] Joy in tribulation; this is the
signification of the word: A fit name for a Prince, Neminen a se dimisit
tristem. Sucton.
who should be Decliciae orbis, as Titus the Emperor, of whom it is said, that
he never sent away any suitor sad or discontented: and remembering on a day that
he had not done any poor man good, he cried out to his friends, Hodie non
regnavimus: Amici, diem perdidi, accounting that day lost wherein he had not
showed some man courtesy. Such a gracious Prince was Job, chap. 29.12. I
delivered the poor that cried, says He, Grand. Sign. Se^ag 148.
and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. The great Turk styles
himself The worlds refuge: professing that all that lament unto him shall have
redress and succor. James the fifth of Scotland was called The poor man's
King, for his readiness to right and relieve the afflicted. Zerubbabel,
however he came by this name Shesbazzar (for that he was the man I take for
granted, Ezra 5.16. with chap. 3.8. Zech. 4.9. though Junius think otherwise)
he deserved it doubtless: and of him it might well be said, Vopisous.
as the Historian does of Probus the Emperor, Si probi nomen non haberet,
habere cognomen posset, Speed. 723.
pity he had been called any thing but Probus, so honest a Prince he was:
think the like here. The Parliament here held Anno 1376, was called The Good
Parliament: and another not long after Parlamentum benedictum. The blessed
Parliament. God grant us such a one next; for at present we are without any,
but not without cause to cry out, This was written, May 18. 1653.
as those in Jeremy, chap. 8.20, 22. The harvest is past, the Summer is ended,
and we are not helped. Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no Physician
there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? We
looked for peace, but no good came: and for a time of health, and behold
trouble, ver. 15.

Verse 9. And this is the number of them] Had they not been things of great
price and use, they would not have been numbered, Cant. 6.8. The Queens and
Concubines are numbered how many; but not the Virgins, that bring not forth
fruit to God. Men use not to count how many pibbles they have in their yard, or
piles of grass in their field, as they do how many pence in their purse, or
sheep in their fold. When the Great God shall count his peoples flittings,
bottle up their tears (as sweet water) book up their sighs (as memorable
matters) Psalm. 56.8. shall we not say of them as the Jews did of Lazarus, when
Jesus wept, Behold how he loves them? When the very hairs of their head are all
numbered, Matthew. 10.30. so that not one of them falls to the ground without
their heavenly Father, what store think we, sets He by their persons, by
their performances? I know thy work, and thy labor, Rev. 2.19. I pity this
people, they have been with me now three days, and fasting they are, and
far from home, and faint they may, if sent away empty, Matthew. 15.32. Lo, is
not this a wonderful condescension, that Christ should consider tantus
tantillos and tales, and reckon every circumstance of their service so
particularly and punctually, that he might give to every man according to his
works? Oh his Jewels, his book of remembrance, etc. Mal. 3.16, 17! See the
Notes there.

Thirty chargers] Serving to hold such parts of the Sacrifices as were to be
eaten by the Priests and others.

Nine and twenty knives] Sacrificing knives, richly hafted.

Verse 10. Thirty basins of gold] These were to hold the sprinkling-water, or
blood.

And other vessels] Of sundry sorts, whereof see 1 Kings 7.50.

Verse 11. All the vessels of gold and of silver] Those best of metals, and
therefore fittest for his use and service, who is Good, Psalm. 106.1. Better,
Psalm. 108.9. Best, Phil. 1. 23. goodness it self, Matthew. 19.17. Whose great
purse is the Earth, with All that is either on it or in it, Psalm. 24.1. whose
great storehouse are the Stars and Planets, the Sun especially making these
metals, and causing plenty, Deuteronomy. 28.12. Let us lavish out of the bag, and
when we have honored the Lord with the Best of our best, cry out with David,
Of thine own, Lord, have we given thee, and with Justinian, 1. Chron. 29.6
Cedren.
dedicating a very rich Communion Table, (...) etc.

CHAP. II. Verse 1. Now these are the children of the province]
THat is, of Judaea now a Province, though formerly a Princess; now solitary
and tributary that was once populous and great among the Nations, Lam. 1.1.
Medinah: the word here rendered Province, sometimes signifies Metropolis,
aliis jus dicens, a place that gives Laws to other places, and so Judaea in
her flourish had been. See chap. 4.20. But now it was otherwise, and so it is
at this day, not only with Judaea, but with other renowned Empires and
Kingdoms not a few, all which (together with most of those Churches and places
so much mentioned in Scripture) are swallowed up in the greatness of the
Turkish Empire. Shi^dler.
That Medina a City in Arabia (where Mahomet lies buried, and where his
Sepulcher is no less visited then is Christ's Sepulcher at Jerusalem) holds
this Medina in hard subjection; making her children pay for the very heads they
wear; and so grievously afflicting them, that they have cause enough to take
up a new Jeremies Elegy over their doleful captivity.

That went up out of the captivity] That listed themselves in Babylon, to go
up. Which if any failed to do, (as by comparing verse 5. of this chapter, with
Nehem. 7.10. it appears some did) it was because either they changed their
minds, or their lives, His life by Crashaw.
before they came there. When that Noble Marquess Galeacius Caracciolus set
forward for Geneva, some of his most familiar friends promised and vowed to
accompany him thither; But diverse of them, when they came to the borders of
Italy, turned back again, etc. and so might many of these ingagers, magis
amantes mundi delicias, quam Christi divitias, and graviorem ducentes jacturam
regionis, quam religionis.

Which had been carried away] But had Gods promise, that they should return,
be built up, planted, and not rooted out, Jer. 24.6. and his command to marry
and beget children, Jer. 29.6. which should inherit the promises; for they are
good surehold.

Whom Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon] That Metus Orbis, and flagellum Dei,
as Attilas King of Hunnes proudly styled himself, that is, The Terror of the
world, Gualth. in Hab. 2. Eucholc.
and scourge in Gods hand. See Esaias. 10.5. That, Ira Dei and Orbis Vastitas, as
Tamerlan loved to be called, The wrath of God, and ruin of the world.

Had carried away to Babylon] As to his Lions-den, Nah. 2.10. but God sent from
heaven and saved them with such a mighty salvation, as eclipsed that
deliverance out of Egypt, Jer. 23.7, 8.

Every one unto his City] Appointed him by the present Governors. For during
their abode in Babylon Judaea lay utterly waste and uninhabited. The Land kept
her Sabbaths, resting from tillage, and God by a wonderful providence, kept the
room empty till the return of the Natives.

Verse 2. That came with Zerubbabel] That famous Prince of Judah, chap. 1.8.
Governor of Judah, Hag. 1.1. who was borne in Babylon, and accordingly had a
Babylonian name. His hands laid the foundation of the second Temple, his hands
also finished, Zech. 4.9. whence some conclude that the Lord gave him a life
much longer then ordinary. His children shall notto bed, till their work be
done.

Jeshua] This was that Jehoshuah the High Priest, the great assistant of
Zerubbabel in building the Temple, chap. 5.1. Hag. 1.14. These were those
faithful Witnesses of God in their generation, as before them had been Moses
and Aaron, Elijab and Elisha, and as after them Paul and Barnabas, Luther and
Melanctho^, Oecolampadius and Zuinglius, etc. Christ sent out his Disciples by
two and two; for two is better then one, and why? See Eccles. 4.9, 10, 11, 12.

Nehemiah, Saraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai] Not that famous Nehemiah, nor that
renowned Mordecai so much spoken of in the book of Esther, but others of the
same name. Reasons see in Master Pembles Period of the Persian Monarchy, page
30, 31.

Bilshan, Mispar, Biguai, Rehum, Baanah] These were all of them Guides and
Governors to the rest, eminent and eximious. To whom in Nehemiah is added a
twelfth man, Nahumani by name, who better bethought himself belike: and having
answered with that young man in the Gospel, and said, I will not, yet
afterward repented and went. Nunqua^ sero, si serio. Mat. 21.29, 30.
This was better then those many that answered and said, We go, Sir, and yet
went not.

The number of the men of the people of Israel] The former were Names, men of
renown in the Congregation (confer Acts 1.15. Rev. 3.3.) The rest that follow
are but Numbers, Nos numeri sumus, etc. (...).
men of common condition, the Many, who are set down in the sequel of the
chapter.

Ver. 3. The children of Parosh] Question is here made by some, whether this
and other like Chapters that are nothing but names and numbers, should be read
in course; since they may seem to be of no great use to us? To this Chrysostom
answers, In sacris libris nihil contemnatur aut obiter praetereatur, etiamsi
nomina recenseantur, that is, Let no part of holy Scripture be slighted or
skipped over, no, though we meet with nothing but names only. But forasmuch as
there is never a leaf, nay, line, nay, letter in Gods book, that is not pure,
precious, and profitable, Prove. 30.5. Psalm. 12.6. 2 Timothy 3.16. (The Rabbines
have a saying, that there is a mountain of sense hanging upon every apex or
tittle of the Word of God) therefore must we read all in obedience to Him, who
has written for us these excellent things in counsel and knowledge, Prove.
22.20. and if any thing be yet hid, God shall reveal even this unto us, Phil.
3.15. Joseph understood not his own dreams at first, till he saw his brethren
prostrate before him; Then Joseph remembered the dreams that he dreamed of
them, Genesis 42.9. The Disciples conceived not, believed not many things done by
and to their Master, till he was glorified, and they farther illightened, John
2.22. and 12.6. Surely if Hippocrates could say of Physic, that there was
nothing to be accounted little in it, (...).
nothing contemptible; how much more may we say the same of Divinity, and of
the Scriptures?

Verse 43. The Nethinims] i. e. Deodati, men given to God, devoted to the
service of his house. These were those Gibeonites that, having saved their
lives by a lie, were for the nearer they were to the Church, the nearer to God.
Their employment was to minister to the Levites, Josh. 9.21.
as the Levites did to the Priests: and this gave them occasion to partake of
the things of God, and to behold his face in righteousness.

Verse 55. The children of Solomon's servants] These also were strangers, that
had been employed by Solomon, and becoming Proselytes, were incorporated into
the Commonwealth of Israel. God is no respecter of persons, Acts 10.33. He
takes where he likes; strangers shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
when the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out, Matthew. 8.11, 12. Solomon's
servants may have a name and a nail in Gods house, when his sons may be
excluded. Jether an Ishmaelite, 1 Chronicles. 7.17. may become an Israelite, 2 Samuel
17.25. and Araunah the Jebusite, an exemplary Proselyte, Zach. 9.7.

Verse 59. And these were they which went up from Telmela Tel-harsa Cherub,
etc.] Places in Chaldaea, where these Jews were scattered; as at this day
their posterity are up and down in Turkey, and some parts of Christendom, a
dis-jected and despised people.

Verse 61. And was called after their name] After the name of his wives father,
that Noble Gileadite; as holding it a greater honor to be allied to Barzillai,
then to be looked upon as a Priest. It was therefore just upon such proud and
insolent people, that as they had once scorned the Priesthood, so the
Priesthood should now scorn them.

Verse 62. But they were not found] They could not prove themselves to be of
the seed of Aaron: and were therefore worthily turned off. So shall all be at
the last day, that are not written among the living in Jerusalem, that are not
registered in the Lambs book of life, that have been ashamed of Christ and of
his words, Mar. 8.38.

Verse 63. And the Tirshata sa^ unto them] i. e. Zerubbabel the chief
Magistrate, a man of great power, and no less courage, who would not be guilty
of passive injustice.

That they should not eat of the most holy things] Make a gain of the
Priesthood, which they had slighted when nothing was to be got by it. Now they
should neither do the work, nor have the means. Cajetan commenting upon
Matthew, then when the French soldiers brake into Rome, and made a scorn and
prey of the Popish Clergy, acknowledges that it was a just hand of God upon
them, because they were grown unsavory salt, good for little else, but to
look after the rites and revenues of the Church.

Till there stood up a Priest with Vrim and Thummim] That is, Never, or not in
haste. Some faint hopes the Governor might have that such an Ephod with Vrim
and Thummim, as was now burnt or otherwise lost, might be had again, but it
seemed not very likely. The great High Priest was now at hand, and the
Ceremonials to cease shortly.

Verse 64. Forty and two thousand] Ten or twelve thousand whereof seem to be
of the ten tribes that were first carried captive, and together with Judah and
Benjamin made up that (...) Saint Paul speaks of, Acts 26.7.

Verse 65. Besides their servants, etc.] Their Masters necessary instruments,
(...) says Aristotle, and wholly at their command. See Prove. 12.9.

Two hundred singing men and singing women] That sang at feasts and funerals.
See Eccles. 2.8. These perhaps might have been as well spared. Nam ad quod
prosunt ejusmodi arts, (says one?) and quis ejusmodi hominum eas profitentium
usus, nisi ut aliis sint oneri, and cibum potumque egenorum, sicut locustae,
praerodant, atque consumant? Funcci^^.


Verse 68. And some of the chief] And but some. All were not alike enlarged, or
enabled.

Verse 69. They gave after their ability] Men must take heed they stretch not
beyond the staple, and so mar all. But few are herein faulty: Few
Macedonians, that, to their power and beyond, are willing of themselves, etc. 2
Cor. 8.3. Rari quippe boni.

Threescore and one thousand drams of gold] That is, nineteen thousand sixty
two pounds ten shillings.

And five thousand pounds of silver] i. e. Fifteen thousand pounds sterling,
These sums of money, together with the costly Priests garments, though they
fall far short of what was provided and given in David's days, 1 Chronicles. 22. and
29. toward the building of the first Temple; yet, considering the mind of
this poor people, and their small ability, this gift was as great in Gods
account. See Luke 21.1, 2. The widows mite was beyond the rich man's
magnificence; because it came out of a richer mind.

Verse 70. And some of the people] For not half of them, as may be probably
thought, returned: but condemned the rest of rashness and weakness, to their
no small prejudice.

CHAP. III. Verse 1. And when the seventh month was come]
HEb. And the seventh month approached; a month of many festivities, Levit.
23.24, 27, 34. 1 Kings 8.2. and so, to the good, a foretaste of eternal life,
where it shall be holiday every day, where they have no rest (and yet no
unrest) praising the God of heaven, for heavens happiness, Psalm. 136. (the
same that these good souls sang together, Rev. 4.
verse 11. of this Chapter) God is praised five and twenty times for his
mercies: but the conclusion is, O give thanks unto the God of heaven, etc.
Christ has cast up such a causway to it, that we may well travel thither from
all coasts, as these Jews did to Jerusalem from all their Cities.

As one man to Jerusalem] There to serve the Lord with one shoulder, Zeph. 3.9.
neither counted they it any trouble to travel thither, though they were scarce
yet warm in their nests, as we say.

Then stood up Joshua] Ministers, of all others should be most forward and
forth-putting: ready pressed and prepared to every good work, as patterns to the
people, who are led more by their eyes then by their ears, etc.

And Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel] These two ever went hand in hand: and
hence the work so prospered in their hand. It must needs be so (said Queen
Elizabeth once to the Suffolk-gentlemen who came to meet her with their
Ministers by their sides) where the Word and the Sword go together.

And builded the Altar of the God of Israel] Which therefore, in their father
Jacobs sense, Genesis 33.20. they might safely have called El, Elohe-Israel, that
is, God, the God of Israel, putting the sign for the thing signified. Thus
also the Arc is called Gods face, Psalm. 105.4. Yea, even God himself, Psalm.
132.5.

As it is written in the Law of Moses] This was the rule they wrought by, God
requires to have a reasonable service, Romans 12.1. such as whereof we can
render a reason out of his Word; he hates a Samaritan service, John 4.22. and
will not endure Popish Will Worship: Who required those things at their hands,
their Altars, Crucifixes, Penances, Pilgrimages, etc.? The whole number of the
Beast is but the number of a man, Rev. 13.18. Men will have it so, and this is
the sum of all Popish religion. All their superstructions are humane
inventions.

Moses the man of God] The Prophet, the Lawgiver, a man of much communion with
God above any other, Number. 12.8. One calls him heavens Chancellor.

Verse 3. And they set the Altar upon his bases] Upon the old foundation in the
Priests Courts, being glad of any place, where to worship God jointly and
publicly: for Temple, as yet, there was none. Our worship-scorners are rightly
styled by one, The last brood of Beelzebub.

For fear was upon them] Though that was a lewd speech of the Poet Statius,
Primus in orb Deos fecit Timor, It was timorousness that first made men
religious; yet there is no question, but fear of danger drives men to God, as
it did these here. Their malignant neighbors bandying and bending their forces
against them, make them hasten up an Altar, that they might get God on their
side, and run to him reconciled, what ever evil should befall them. Be not thou
a terror to me Lord, says holy Jeremy, chap. 17.17. and then I fear no
creature. Let us sing the 46. Psalm (said Luther once in a great strait) and
then let the Devil do his worst. What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee,
Psalm. 56.3. Some read the text thus, Though fear was upon them, yet that
hindered not their setting up Gods Altar: but they brake through all
discouragements, and did their duty. It is well observed that the very light of
Nature taught Heathens, that the services they performed to their gods with
peril and hazard to themselves, were best accepted. Caius Fabius ventured
thorough the enemies camp to offer a solemn anniversary sacrifice, and
returned in safety: satis sperans (says the Historian) propitios fore Deos,
quorum cultum ne mortis quidem metu prohibitus intermisisset, trusting that in
such a case his gods would secure him. When Numa (the second King of the
Romans) heard, as he was sacrificing, that the enemies were coming, he made
this answer, At ego rem divinam facio: If God be for us, (...). Plut.
who shall be against us?

And they offered burnt-offerings thereon] That their sins might be expiated,
and their persons protected. The Ceremonial Law was Christ in figure, it was
their Gospel.

Verse 4. They kept also the feast of Tabernacles] Or boothes, built of boughs
or branches of thick trees, Nehem. 8.15. in a grateful memorial of Gods
gracious preservation of them in the Wilderness, where they dwelt in tents or
tabernacles. It signified also (the Prophet Zachary being interpreter, chap.
14.16, 17, 18, 19.) that the remembrance of our redemption by Christ, should be
perpetuated with all spiritual gladness.

By number, according to the custome] There is an elegancie in the Original;
the Book of God has many such, as I have elsewhere noted.

As the duty of every day required] Heb. The matter of the day in his day. Here
we are all travelers, having no certain habitation, Heb. 11.13. (...), 1 Cor.
4.11. Let us account duty a debt, (...).
and be daily doing at it. Let us keep holy day, keep the Feast, 1 Cor. 5.8.
Let us be in the fear of the Lord all the day long, Prove. 23.17.

Verse 5. And afterward offered] Finding a flote of holy affections in their
hearts, they passed from one good exercise to another, and were indefatigable
in the Lords work. David finding such an heat and height in his people, prays
God to keep it ever in the imagination of the thoughts of their hearts, which
he knew well to be fickle and false, 1 Chronicles. 29.18.

Both of the new-moones] Kept in thankfulness to God for their time renewed
upon them, from month to month, and his mercies every morning, and moment.

And of all the set-feasts of the Lord that were consecrated] By an holy
resting both from corporal labor, and from spiritual idleness.

A free will offering] See the note on Chap. 1.4.

Ver. 6. From the first day of the seventh moneth] Which was the feast of
blowing of trumpets, signifying the just man's joyfulnesse, and serving to put
life and spirit into them.

Began they to offer.] And so held on: for this month had as many feasts in it
as were celebrated in all the year besides: So as the Sabbath was the Queen of
days, Regina dierum.
so was this of months. See the note on verse 1.

But the foundation of the Temple.] Heb. Of the Kingly Palace, aula basilica,
used here and elsewhere for the place where Gods honor dwells. God is a
great King, Mal. 1.14. and requires to be served like himself.

Was not yet laid] Heb. Was not yet founded. Nevertheless they would be
worshipping God as they could at an Altar, till they had a Temple. All the
power of Persia could not keep God and Daniel asunder: the trade of godliness
never stands still. Dan. 6. Contra Arist:
Demosthenes could say that an heart beautified with piety, justice and
modesty, is the best Temple, and to God most acceptable.

Verse. 7. They gave money also unto the Masons and Carpenters.] Who usually get
it and eat it, laying up little: their life is called the Life of their hands,
because maintained by the labor of their hands: day-wages they must have, or
they cannot subsist; Esaias 57.10.
and these good Jews spared for no cost, but gave money out of the bag freely to
these workmen. Idolaters care not what cost they cast away upon their dumb
idols: Deum alienum dotant, so some read that text, Psalm. 16.4. The Turkish
Stately Moschees, and Popish Basilicae stuffed with vowed presents and memories
(as they call them,) are things known to all. When the famous Artificer Phydias
advised the Athenians to make the statue of Minerva rather of marble then of
ivory, 1. Because more durable; this passed with allowance, 2. Because less
chargeable; this they abhorred, and bade him say no more of such a matter.

And meat, and drink, and oile] More prized by the Tyrians and Sidomans then
money, because their Country was nourished by this Country, Acts 12.20. as
being barren, and not bringing forth provision enough for themselves. Diogenes
deeply taxed the folly of his Athenians, that prized money so much, and
bread-corne so little: when as the life of man could be without that, but not
without the other.

To bring Cedar-trees] Smooth and durable, and every way fit for fair
buildings: and therefore made choice of by God himself, 2 Samuel 7.7. by Solomon
for the first Temple, Vitruvius.
1 Kings 5.6. and by these Jews for the second. The Temple of Diana at Ephesus
was likewise built of Cedar: as the Devil affects to be Gods ape.

To the Sea of Joppa] This was an haven-towne, Josh. 19.46. Acts 9.43. Jon.
1.3. and has its name a pulchritudine and elegantia, from its beauty and
bravery, such as draws love and liking. It might have been called The fair
havens, as well as that place nigh unto the City of Lasea, Acts 27.8. which
retains the same name unto this day.

According to the grant] Or license, which they took in the largest extent, as
we also ought to do Gods gracious promises. Promissa sunt amplianda; and we
must labor to see our own names written in them.

Verse 8. To set forward the work] To urge the continuance of it to the end, as
the word signifies; to encourage and call upon the workmen to hasten and go
thoroughstitch: to be as so many (...), that the business might go on end, and
come to a good upshot.

Verse 9. Then stood Jeshua] Not the High Priest, but another, a Levite.

The sons of Henadad with their sonnes] A generation of godly and active men
in the things of God, See Nehem. 3.18.24. and 10.9. Grace is not hereditary,
the white Halegons hatch black young ones: Heroum filii noxae. Nevertheless,
nurture helps nature: and good men strive to mend that by education, which
they have marred by propagation. They cocker not, but correct their children;
they pray for them, and drop good principles into them; they smooth them as
arrows, Psalm. 128.3, 4. getting off the knottinesse of their nature; and leave
not till they see them the work of Gods hands, so as to sanctify the holy One
of Jacob, and to fear the God of Israel, Esaias 29.23. These sons of Henadad,
as they attended upon the Temple-work, so themselves were as the polished
corners of the Temple, Psalm. 144.12.

Verse 10. With trumpets] These were used on all occasions of rejoicing.
Aelian. hist. ult.


With Cymbals] Instruments of a shrill sound, used also by the Heathens at
offering of their sacrifices. So, in Imitation of the Vrim and Thummim, Exodus
28.30. The Egyptian High Priest wore about his neck a sapphire-stone, which was
called (...). Satan Dei Mimus, ut and Momus. See before verse 7.

After the ordinance of David] He very much added to the Church-musick. He
likewise anticipated the age of the Priests, entering into their service five
years earlier then the Mosaical appointment.

Verse 11. And they sang together by course] Amant alterna Camaenae:
Antiphonies are of ancient use.

In praising and giving thanks] Men praise God for his excellencies, thank him
for his benefits.

Because he is good] So they sang David's Psalms a good warrant for us so to
do. Heretofore happy were they held, that could sound out aliquid Davidicum:
Now some have found out new inventions.

Verse 12. Who were ancient men] From seventy years of age, and upwards: for it
was but threescore years before this, that the Temple was burnt.

Wept with a loud voice] Considering the disproportion. Let us do the like,
when we compare our state of Creation with our state of Corruption.

Verse 13. The noise of the shout of joy from the noise, etc.] Nam partim
jubilabant, partim ejulabant. Our joys while we are here, will be mixed joys.
Let those that would have joys unspeakable, stir up sighs unutterable.

CHAP. IV. Verse 1. Now when the adversaries of Judah]
ARroused by those loud acclamations and outcries, chap. 3.12, 13. These
adversaries were those Samaritans; chap. 3.3. a kind of mongrels that wore
Religion as a cloak, which they either put on, or threw off at pleasure, and as
occasion required. Satan (says one) does not always appear in one and the
same fashion: but has as many several shapes as Proteus among the Poets. Here
he pretends devotion to his mischievous designs, but was frustrated.

That the children of the captivity] Istos deportatos, by way of contempt as
Junius rendereth it: As if the Jews were therefore hated of God, because they
had been transported, captivated. Tully passes the same censure of them in
his Oration, pro L, Flacco: Istagens quam chara diis immortalibus esset docuit,
quod est victa, quod elocata, quod servata. It appears how dear to God they be
by their oft-captivities.

Verse 2. Let us build with you] Craftily and treacherously do they offer their
cost and pains, ut illis intermixti personas committerent, atque ita opus
interverterent, says one well; that mingling with them, they might set them
together by the ears, and so put a stop to the work. Socrat. Theodor.
Thus Julian, to spite the Christians, first set the Jews awork to rebuild
their Temple: and when that would not be, he called home the Arian-Bishops out
of banishment, to breed new broils in the Church. The Jesuits have a practice
at this day, of running over to the Lutheran Church, pretending to be Converts,
and to build with them: but it is only to keep up that bitter contention that
is between the Calvinists and the Lutherans. And what ill offices they do
amongst us at this day to heighten our divisions, and hinder the Reformation
(by their wiles, much ensnared and hindered) good men are very sensible of. The
Lord detect and defeat them.

For we seek your God, as ye do] Nay, not as ye do. See 2 Kings 17.32, 33, 34.
they feared the Lord, not filially, but for his Lions: as the old Romans
worshipped their Veiones, lest they should hurt them: and as the Caffrani (a
people in India) worship Devils in most terrible figure, that they may not
punish them.

Since the days of Esar-haddon] Son and successor to Sennacherib, 2 Kings
19.37. grand son to Salmaneser: after whom, it seems, he brought a new colony
into the Land of Samaria, who proved deadly enemies to Gods people.

Verse 3. But Zerubbabel and Jeshua] Jeshua would be one to keep them out,
though they slighted him in their application to Zerubbabel and the chief of
the fathers, verse 2.

You have nothing to do with us] You shall neither conquer us, nor compound
with us. This was right Roman resolution. They were wont to say of cowards in
Rome, that there was nothing Roman in them. I can never sufficiently admire
(says one) the speech of blessed Luther, who (though he was very earnest to
have the Communion administered in both kinds contrary to the Doctrine and
custom of Rome,) yet he professes, if the Pope (as Pope) commanded him to
receive in both kinds, he would receive but in one kind; lest he should seem
to receive the mark of the Beast. As for these Reconcilers, and Moderatours
(says another learned man) were they the wisest under heaven, and should live
to the worlds end, they would be brought to their wits end, before they could
accomplish this works end, to make a reconciliation betwixt Rome and us. They
have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God. From such stand off,
says the Apostle, 1 Timothy 6.5. Say to them (when they offer their cost and
service) as here. Pura Deus men's est: procul; o procul este profani. This was
one of those ancient Laws of the twelve tables among the Romans, Impius ne
audeto placare donis iram deorum, Let no profane person presume to think to
pacify the gods with their pains, or presents.

But we our selves together will build, etc.] This, the adversaries call
combination, conspiracy, faction, sedition, etc. See verse 13. But what says
Tertullian? Cum boni, cum probi coeunt -- non est factio dicenda, sed curia. Et
e contra, illis nomen factionis accommodandum est, qui in odium piorum and
proborum conspirant. When good men get together, Apol. advers. gent. number. 520.
and hold together, it is not to be called a faction, but a Court. As on
to'ther side, they are to be counted factious, who conspire against the godly,
as these Malignants in the Text did.

As King Cyrus, etc.] They had good authority for what they did, and they hold
them to it.

Verse 4. Then the people of the land] Who the nearer they came unto a
conjunction with the Jews in matters of Religion, the deeper hatred they bare
them. Thus at this day, a Jew hates a Christian worse then he does a Pagan; so
does a Turk hate a Persian worse then he does a Christian; a Papist, a
Protestant, worse then he does a Turk: a Formallist, a Puritan, worse then he
does a Papist. Odia Theologica sunt acerbissima.

Weakened the hands of the people of Judah] Discouraged them all they could,
endeavoring to transfuse (as it were) a dead-palsie into their fingers, that
they might surcease, or, at least, slack their pains. Well might Solomon say,
Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous: but who can stand before envy? surely
the venom of all vices is found in this sharp-fanged malignity.

And troubled them in building] Heb. Kept ado about them, and terrified them.
(...):
This was to do the work of their father the Devil, that troubler of Gods
Israel. (ad injuriam inferendam totus comparatus) set upon it to vex such as
begin but to build the Tower of godliness, and to hinder them to the utmost.

Verse 5. And hired Counselors against them] But good Counselors would not
have been hired, either to bolster out a bad cause, or to outface a good; to
justify the wicked for a reward, or to take away the righteousness of the
righteous from him. Spartian.
There is a notable instance of this in Papinian a Pagan Counselor. Thou
may (said he to Antoninus the fratricide,) command my neck to the block, but
not my tongue to the bar. I prize not my life to the pleading of an ill
cause. These sordida poscinummia in the text, were none such. Some think they
were Courtiers and Counselors to the King: such as by whom the King was even
bought and sold, as Aurelian the good Emperor was; who might know nothing but
as his Counselors informed him. This made Alphonsus King of Arragon say, that
Kings were herein most miserable, that whereas they abounded with all things
else, the truth of matters they could seldom come by.

All the days of Cyrus King of Persia] Who warring abroad, committed the
government of his Kingdom to his son Cambyses a light and lewd lossel,
easily prevailed with to hinder so good a work.

Even until the reign of Darius] i. e. Of Darius Nothus (say some) the son
of Artaxerxes Longimanus (named verse 7.) the father of Artaxerxes Mnemon.
Pemble.
But they do better in my opinion, that understand the text of Darius
Histaspis, who succeeded Cambyses, and married his sister; seeking to
ingratiate with the people by ratifying whatsoever Cyrus had decreed, and this
of the Temple among the rest. See chap. 6.1.

Verse 6. And in the reign of Ahashuerosh] That is, of Cambyses, who is also
called Artaxerxes in the next verse: for these two names were given to many
Kings of Persia; like as Pharaoh was to the Kings of Egypt, as a title of
honor. Ahashuerosh signifies an hereditary Prince. Daniel calls him the
Prince of the Kingdom of Persia. chap. 10.13. because he was Viceroy in his
fathers absence. Infamous he is for many lewd pranks (as that he killed his
brother, and then his own sister, after he had first married her, and made a
Law that any man might do the like) yet was he not so ungracious a son to
Cyrus, as our Henry the seconds eldest son was; whom he not only crowned
King during his own life, but also, to do him honor at his Coronation,
renounced the name of a King for that day, and (as Sewer) served at the table.
For which he was thus requited, My father said he, is not dishonored by
attending on me; for I am both a Kings and a Queens son, and so is not he.

In the beginning of his reigne] As loath to lose time ( Esau began in the very
womb to persecute Jacob) and as taking their fittest season, for granting of
suits.

Wrote they an accusation] Heb. a Satanical suggestion, a diabolical
accusation, hatched in hell, and dictated by the Devil. He it is that acts and
agitateth the Saints adversaries and accusers; sitting upon their tongues and
pens, and setting an edge on them.

Verse 7. And in the days of Artaxerxes] This seems to be Cambyses his Persian
name, as Ahashuerosh was his Chaldee name. It is as much as Bellator egregius,
an excellent warrior. So Scipi, was called Fulmen belli, the light-bolt of
war: Bajazet the great Turk, Turk. Hist.
Gilderun, or lightning: Albert, Marquess of Brandenburg, was called Achilles
Teutonicus. Bucholc.
Our black Prince was so named, not of his color, but of his courage, and of
his dreaded acts in battle: for he assailed no Nation which he over-came not;
Speed.
he besieged no City which he took not. Cambyses had great success in his
wars, and added Egypt, and other Countries, to the Persian Monarchy.

Wrote Bishlam Mithredath] These were the King of Persia's Toparches or
Deputies, beyond the river Euphrates.

Written in the Syrian tongue] Called also the Chaldee, Babylonish and
Assyrian; commonly spoken by the Jews, who in the seventy years captivity lost
the purity of their own language; like as the Latins also did, when the
Goths, Vandals and other barbarous Nations overran them, and mingled with
them.

And interpreted in the Syrian tongue] i. e. with Syrian characters, Et
Scriptura and lingua erat Syriaca, ut sine interpret in aula regis
intelligeretur, says Shindler. It was so written that it might be understood
at Court without an interpreter.

Verse 8. Rehum the Chancellour] Or President of the Council. It is of the
Chaldee termination: the whole history also following to chap. 6.19. is
Chaldee, transcribed, as some think, out of the rolls and registers of the
Chaldees, and here inserted.

Verse 9. The Dinaites and the Apharsathkites, the Tarpalites] This was not
unity, but conspiracy of a rabble of rebels against God and his people. So
Psalm. 83.5, 6, etc. They have consulted together with one consent, they are
confederate against thee. The Tabernacles of Edom and the Ishmaelites of Moab,
and the Hagarenes, etc. A whole legion of Devils could agree to enter into one
poor man, to vex him; and to act, as one, in that possession.

Verse 10. The great and noble Asnapper] Some great Commander under the
Assyrian Monarch. There is, they say, a greatness Belluine, and a greatness
Genuine-Asnapper, notwithstanding his big-swoln titles, might be rather great
then good; and more notable, then noble. Juvenal.
Nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus.

On this side the river] That ancient river- the river Euphrates, which the
more I see, the more I admire, says one.

Verse 11. Thy servants] Not thy subjects only, but thine Officers.

Verse 12. The rebellious and bad City] After so many years, does Jerusalem rue
one perfidious act of Zedekiah: and having once been treacherous, it still
hears, The rebellious and bad City, as if it had been a very (...), a
professed Sanctuary of roguery, (as the Jesuits say of Geneva) and as Florus
says of the Temple at Jerusalem, that it was impiae gentis arcanum.

And have set up the walls thereof] This was no less false then scandalous.
But malice cares not how true the accusation is, but how mischievous.

And joined the foundations] Chald. sewed together. Or, rather these
false-informers had sewed a lie together with great Art, that it might seem a
truth, Psalm. 119.69. The proud have forged a lie against me, assuunt mendacium
mendacio, they have taught their tongues to speak lies, Jer. 9.5. and are
Artists at it.

Verse 13. Be it known now unto the King] q. d. This is no light business,
but of greatest importance: and therefore fit to be noted and noticed.

Then will they not pay tole, tribute, etc.] This is an old device of the Devil
and his Impes, to represent Gods people to the world as Antimagistratical, and
disturbers of the public peace. Thus they dealt by the Primitive Christians,
who were the Emperors best subjects, and yielded them greatest respect and
profit. Thus Francis King of France pretended and professed to the Princes of
Germany (whose friendship he desired) that he pursued the Lutherans with fire
and sword, for no other cause but for that they were Levellers, and enemies to
civil government. This drew from Calvin (who was then but twenty five years of
age) that golden book of his Institutions of Christian Religion, to free the
Reformed Churches of that slurre and slander. The like was suggested by the
Arminians in the Low Countries, and by the Episcopal party here. It was in
Tacitus his time, unum crimen, eorum qui crimine vacabant, the only fault of
such as were indeed without fault.

And so thou shall endamage the revenue] Diminish the annual Entrado's of the
crown which are well called the Kings strength here; because if these fail,
little good can be done, either at home or abroad. Henry King of Navarre
(afterward King of France) was wont to say, that he was an husband without a
wife, a soldier without money, and a King without a Kingdom. What would the
King of Spaines greatness soon come to, were it not for his yearly incomes,
his mines of America?

Verse 14. Now because we have maintenance from the Kings Palace] Chaldee. Are
salted with the salt of the Palace, Salarium de regis palatio percipimus, have
our salary from the Court, as Junius rendereth it. The great use of salt makes
it here put for all kind of commodity: like as bread is called panis, as if it
were (...), The all, and whole of our sustenance, Deuteronomy. 8.3.

And it was not meet for us to see the Kings dishonour] Chald. Nakedness,
privities, which uncovered, cause contempt, as it befell Noah in his
drunkenness: and the King of Spain, when by Queen Elizabeth proclaimed
Bankrupt.

Therefore have we sent and certified the King] As knowing that
Beneficium-postulat officium; Bounty commands duty. Ingratitude is a monster in
nature, a solecisme in good manners, etc. Lycurgus would make no Law against
it, because he held that none could be so unreasonable, as to be guilty of it.
Yet Alphonsus complained of his ungrateful Courtiers; and so did Frederick the
third, Emperor of Germany. Queen Elizabeth also said, that in trust she had
often found treason. That traitor Parry had vowed her death, Speed.
although he had been condemned for burglary, and saved by her pardon.

Verse 15. In the book of the Records] Chald. Of the Remembrances, that is, the
Chronicles usual in all Kingdoms.

And that this City is a rebellious City] See the Note on verse 12. and learn,
that fidelity to governors is ever both safe and honorable. Zedekiah's
falsifying his oath to the King of Babylon, was the overthrow of that
Commonwealth. See what God himself says, not without great indignation, Ezekiel.
17.18. Seeing he (Zedekiah) despised the oath, by breaking the Covenant (when
lo he had given his hand) and has done all these things, he shall not escape.

Verse 16. We certify the King] They doubt not of audience, whilst they sang
a song of Vtile; which therefore they thus set on with more confidence then
charity.

Verse 17. Peace, and at such a time] As the Latins saluting say, Ave, or
Salve, Hieron.
the Greeks (...), so the Hebrews and Syrians say, Shalom lach, that is, Peace
be to thee. The Turks salutation at this day also is, Salaum aleek; the reply
Aleek Salaum, Blount.
Peace is a complexive blessing.

Verse 18. Has been plainly read before us] This in the general was
commendable: but he should have reserved (as Alexander used to do) (...), One
ear free; and have heard both parties.

Verse 19. Has made insurrection against Kings] Chald. Lift up it self against
Kings. Pride is painted with a triple crown on her head; Upon the first
whereof is written Transcendo; upon the second, Non obedio; upon the third,
Perturbo. Wat Tyler the rebel dared to say, that all the Laws of England
should come out of his mouth. Spead.


Verse 20. Beyond the river] Euphrates the boundary of Solomon's Empire, 1 Kings
4.21, 24. as it was also promised, Genesis 15.18. Exodus 23.31. Deuteronomy. 11.24.
Joshuah 1.4.

Verse 21. Give you now commandment] Chald. Make a Decree: which yet did but
carry on Gods Decree: for while persecutors sit backward to his command, they
row forwards to his Decree.

Verse 22. Take heed now that ye fail not] This was to spur a free-horse:
like as litters were sent from King Philip and Queen Mary to Bishop Bonner,
complaining that Heretics were not so reformed as they should be, and
exhorting him to more diligence.

Why should damage grow] Take heed of that howsoever. Multi reges graviorem
ducunt jacturam regionis, quam religionis, etc. Bucholcer.


Verse 23. They went up in haste] Perurgente diabolo, the Devil driving them,
and their own malicious dispositions egging them thereunto. So, when Queen
Mary lay a dying, Bern. Acts and Mon. 1562.
Harpsfeild Archdeacon of Canterbury being at London, made all post-haste home
to dispatch those Martyrs, whom he had then in his cruel custody. So ambitious
are wicked men of hell, they take long strides, and mend their pace; as if they
feared, lest it should be taken up before they come thither.

Verse. 24. Then ceased the work of the house of God] And now the adversaries
have got the ball on the foot, thinking to carry the game before them: But the
triumphing of the wicked is short, Job 20.5. and that they prosper at all in
their designs, it is non ad exitium, sed ad exercitium Sanctorum; not for the
ruin of the Church, but for the exercise of the faith and patience of Gods
people.

CHAP. V. Verse 1. Then the Prophets]
HE that is now called a Prophet, was before-time called a Seer, 1 Samuel 9.9.
because his eyes were illightened, Number. 24.3. and he saw visions of God, Ezekiel.
1.1. Dan. 1.17, Prophets they were afterward called, that is, Interpreters of
Gods will by his command, Exodus 7.1. Aaron thy brother shall be thy Prophet,
that is, thine Interpreter. By the mouth of these holy Prophets God spoke to
his people in all ages, Luke 1.70. Yet not without some intermissions of
Prophecy, as the Church complains, Psalm. 74.9. till that Cathimath Chazon
(as the Jews call it) the sealing up of Prophecy, which they place between
the Prophet Malachi, and John Baptist, who was more then a Prophet. The
Original word Nabi, signifies one that, from the inward counsel of God
utters Oracles.

Haggai the Prophet] Who was not an Angel incarnate, as Origin and Hierom held;
but a young Saint (as Epiphanius describes him) and might therefore well be an
old Angel, if he lived to be old. Juvenis admodum ex Babylone profectus est
Hicrosolymam, etc. Epiph. lib. de Proph. vit.
See more of him Hag. 1.1. with the note there.

And Zechariah the son of Iddo] That is, of Barachiah the son of Iddo,
Zech. 1.1. See the Note there. These two God sent within two months one of
another, in the eighteenth year of the peoples return out of Babylon; which
fell out to be in the second year of the reign of Darius Hystaspes, and in the
three thousand four hundred forty and fourth year of the world, according to
Funccius his Chronology. Christ usually sent his Prophets and Apostles by
couples, for mutual comfort, and greater confirmation.

Prophesied unto the Jewes] Who had brought a judgment of sore famine upon
themselves by their slacknesse and backwardness to rebuild the House of God,
Hag. 1.4, 6. See the Notes there; (...). Herodot. Mat. 22.21.
and learn of the Heathen Historian, to prefer Gods interest before thine
own, or else to look for his curse. For he is a great King, and stands upon
his seniority, Mal. 1.14. he will have us first to seek his Kingdom, Matthew.
6.33. and to give unto God the things that are Gods; or we shall hear of him,
to our small comfort.

In the name of the God of Israel] Who both authorized and enabled them: God
sends none whom He gifteth not. The Apostles also were Ambassadors in the
same name, 2 Cor. 5.20. and so, Colleagues to the Prophets, Luke 10.16. (See 1
Pet. 1.12.) Angels admiring the matter o^ their Ambassie, and their happy
harmony.

Even unto them] Who yet were very little amended by their seventy years
captivity. Afflictions (Gods hammers) had but beaten upon cold iron, (as it
were) as appears by this History, and by the Prophesies of Haggai and
Zechariah; whom for his labor and love to their souls, Hoc ictu ceu didactro
accepto Linus mortuus est. Buchol.
they afterward slew betwixt the Temple and the Altar, Matthew. 23.35. serving
him as Hercules did his Tutour Linus, whom, for a few sharp words given him, he
knocked on the head. Or, as their Ancestors did the Prophet Esaias, whom they
sawed asunder (says Hierome out of the Rabbines) because he had called them
Princes of Sodom, and people of Gomorrah, Esaias. 1.10. This is the worlds wages
to faithful Ministers.

Verse 2. Then rose up Zerubbabel] Called before, Shazbazzar, the Tirshata:
Philo calls him Barachias. Men in those days had sundry names; which must be
noted, or else confusion will not be avoided; according to the notation of
Zerubbabels name. Alienus a confusione, ut quidam perhibent.
It is said of him, that he brought back part of the people in the seventeenth
year of his age; that he continued Governor fifty eight years (some say many
more:) and that he began to make use of the Ministry of these Prophets in the
thirty fourth year of his life. His rising up here implies his forwardness,
speed, and diligence in the work.

And Jeshua the son of Jozadak] Colleague to Zerubbabel, and (...), as Aaron
was to Moses. This Jehoshua or Jeshua began his office of High Priest in the
year of the world 3428. and held it thirty six years, eight whereof were spent
in an Embassage to Darius King of Persia, say Historians.

And began to build the house of God] i. e. They went on with the building,
begun before, chap. 3.10. and not forbidden by the King of Persia to be
finished; only he commanded them to desist from building the City, chap. 4.12,
21. It was, therefore, the peoples sloth and self-seeking that kept back the
work. See the Notes on Hag. 1.2, 4.

And with them were the Prophets of God helping them] Verbo and opere, says
Junius: both by word and deed. The words of the wise are as goades, Eccles.
12.11. pricking men forward to duty: and especially when themselves set sides
and shoulders to the work, as happily these Prophets did, for the peoples greater
encouragement. Exemplis sciola hac aetate magis aedificant Ministri, quam
concionibus.

Verse 3. At the same time] So soon as ever they began but to build Gods
house, they meet with opposition; which is still Evangelii Genius, says
Calvin, the bad Angel that haunts the cause of God, and dogs it at the
heels. Satan, out of his inveterate envy and enmity, can in no wise brook the
propagation of the Truth, and dilatation of Christ's curtains. No sooner is
Israel out of Egypt, but Pharaoh pursues them. No sooner had Ezekiah kept that
solemn Passover, but Sennacherib comes up against him. Esau began to justle
Jacob in the womb, that no time might be lost: and when he set his face
homewards, Laban follows him with one troop, Esau meets him with another: both
with hostile intentions. Dream not of a delicacie in Gods ways, but suffer
hardship, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

And their companions] Cum collegio suo, Jun. a company of caytives combined to
do mischief. See chap. 4.9. with the Note.

Who has commanded you to build this house?] Their own houses they builded,
and were never once questioned. All the while our Savior lay in his fathers
shop, and meddled only with carpenters chips, the Devil and his impes never
troubled him: but when he was entering upon his Ministry, he is sharply
assaulted in the Wilderness. And when he took upon him to purge the Temple,
and better inform the people, presently the Grandees came upon him as he was
teaching, and said, By what authority do thou these things? and who gave
thee this authority? Matthew. 21.23. Like unto these were the questions put by
the Papists to those noble Reformers, Luther, Zuinglius, etc. Farellus was, at
his first coming to Geneva, more harshly handled, and by the Bishop and his
Clerks thus accoasted: Quid tu, diabole nequissime, ad hanc civitatem
perturbandam accessisti? What a Devil make thou here, to make this
disturbance, etc. and so was driven out of that City, Scultet. Anual.
where afterward he wrought a glorious Reformation.

Verse 4. Then said we unto them] We ( Tatnai, Shether-Boznai and their
companions) thus said, and thus enquired: see verse 16. and be sensible, how
wicked men conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and their belly
prepares deceit, Job 15.35. Not their heads only are hammering it, but their
bellies are hatching it: they take a kind of contemplative kind of pleasure
in their wily projects, as the Epicure does in his dainties, he delights to be
acting them over a forehand.

What are the names of the men] They that are minded to do mischief unto
others, will do what they can to know their names. I have heard of one (says
Master Fox) who being sent to the Christian Congregation in Queen Mary's days
in London to take their names, and to espy their doings, yet in being amongst
them was converted, Acts and Mon. fol. 1881.
and cried them all mercy. Tremellius reads this text otherwise, Then
answered we them thus, and [told them] what were the names of the men, who
builded this building. He means, as I conceive, We were not ashamed or afraid
to make them a round and ready answer; and to give them the names of our
chieftains, Zerubbabel, Jeshuae, Haggai, Zechariah, etc. This was better then
that of those cold friends to Religion, 1 Kings 18.11. who (when the Prophet
had said, If the Lord be God, follow him) held their peace, and thought it good
policy to reserve themselves. Better also then that of the bondslaves of
Antichrist, who receive his mark in their hand, the which they may, as occasion
serves, cover or discover. Rev. 13.16. The servants of the God of heaven and
earth (such as were these in this Chapter, verse 11.) receive his mark in their
foreheads, where it may be seen and read of all, Hom. de 2. Martyr.
Rev. 7.3. The Primitive Christians were called in derision Confitentes: and
Chrysostom says of them, that they would not be kept from visiting the
Martyrs in prison, tametsi multis tesroribus, etc. though they were much
threatened, and punished for so doing.

Verse 5. But the eye of their God was upon the Elders] Not the eye of his
general providence only (which like unto a well-drawne picture vieweth every
one that comes in to a room) but the eye of his special grace and favor,
Psalm. 34.15. He looked upon them; as afterward the Son of man stood and
looked upon Saint Steven combating with his cruel persecutors, and clapped him on
the shoulders, as it were, saying, Cheer up, Vincenti dab^, etc. Acts. 7.56.
They also looked up to him, and were lightened: and their faces were not
ashamed, Psalm. 34.5. Yea, they were steeled, as it were, and made more
mettle-full: like as Moses and Micaiah when they had once seen God in his
favor, they cared not for the menaces of angry Monarchs.

That they could not cause them to cease] Saints dare undertake and undergo any
thing for the glory of their God. The heavens shall sooner fall then I will go
against my conscience, said that Martyr. In nothing be terrified by your
adversaries, Phil. 1.28.

Till the matter came to Darius] Nor then neither; for he encouraged and
furthered them, chap. 6.

And then they returned answer] Or, Then answer was returned from the Court,
and the Jews had a sufficient authority for what they did.

Verse 6. The Apharsachites] That is, Persians, sent as deputies by the King of
Persia, to see the peace kept, and good orders observed.

Verse 7. All peace] See the Note on chap. 4.17. Peace is a complexive mercy --
Pacem te poscimus omnes. It is well with Bees, when they make a noise in their
Hive: but with men, when they are at quiet in their hearts, in their houses,
and in the public.

Verse 8. To the house of the great God] So they style him, because the Jews
called and counted him so. The Lord your God, says Moses, is God of gods, and
Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty and a terrible, etc. Deuteronomy. 10.17. He is
Fortissimus Maximus, as Tremellius there renders it: yea, he is a degree above
the superlative. Not only is God great as here, greater, Job 33.12. Greatest,
Psalm. 95.3. but Greatness it self, Psalm. 145.3. and to him all other Gods
(whether Deputed or Reputed) are but deastri, deunculi, diim inorum gentium,
petty deities, poor businesses.

Verse 9. Who commanded you] Chald. Who has made you a Decree? See the Note on
verse 3.

Verse 10. We asked their names also] See verse 4.

That were the chief of them] For the rude multitude follow as they are led.
And as in a beast, the whole body goes after the head, so do most people after
their Rulers and Ringleaders: hence that severity of God, Number. 25.4. Take all
the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord against the Sun.

Ver. 11. We are the servants of the God of heaven] And in that respect, higher
then all the Kings on the earth, Psalm. 89.27. (for all his servants are sons,
heirs of God, and coheirs with Christ, Romans 8.17.) who have held it no small
honor to be called his vassals. See how bold these (...) men bear themselves
upon this relation to the God of heaven and earth, and how courageously they
stand to their work, and stout it out with their adversaries. See Prove. 28.1.
with the Note.

These many years ago] Five hundred at least.

Verse 12. But after that our fathers had provoked] Sin is the makebate that
sets heaven and earth at odds, and hurleth confusion over the whole creation,
Esaias 59.2. Number. 11.31. there were more remarkable expressions of Gods anger
upon man's sin in the dead body of a man, then of a beast: One made unclean
but till the evening; the other for seven days.

He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar] This is still the property of
sin unpardoned, to raise the Posse comitatus, all the armies of God against
the sinner.

Verse 13. But in the first year of Cyrus] See chap. 1. verse 1. with the Notes.

Verse 14. The Temple of Babylon] For there also was a Temple built for Bell.
Faciunt and vespae favos: simis imitantur homines. The Devil will needs be Gods
Ape, and affects to be semblably worshipped.

Verse 15. Take these vessels, go, carry them] Go thy self in person; and see
that all things be well carried there: This pleased Zerubbabel well; it
confined him to live in that element where he would live: as if one should be
confined to Paradise.

Verse 16. Then came the same Sheshbazzar] All this is truly and fairly related
(as was likewise that of Doeg to Saul, against Ahimelech) but with no good
intent. Now to speak the truth, not for any love to the truth, nor for respect
to justice, nor for the bettering of the hearer, or of the offender; but only
to incense the one, and prejudice the other: this is plain slandering.

And yet it is not finished] And all by reason of such ill-conditioned persons
as your selves, who retarded it.

Verse 17. Now therefore if it seem good] Verba byssina.

Whether it be so] They supposed it was nothing so, and hoped that these Jews
would be found falsaries; but it fell out far otherwise: like as Saint Paul's
persecutions at Rome fell out rather unto the furtherance of the Gospel, then
else, Phil. 1.12.

CHAP. VI. Verse 1. Then Darius the King.
Darius Hystaspes, who succeeded Cambyses; being chosen by the Princes of the
Persians, as says Herodotus. Plato commends him for a restorer of the
Persian Monarchy, much defaced under Cambyses. Howbeit he discommendeth him for
this, In Thalia lib 3. de Legib.
that he bred not his son Xerxes so well as he might have done, and further
testifies, that to him it might be said; O Darius, how little care have thou
taken to shun Cyrus his slacknesse? for thou have bred Xerxes every whit as
ill, as he did Cambyses. (...).


In the house of the Rolles] So called, because rolled up together; volumes
rolled up, like the web upon the pin.

Verse 2. And there was found at Achmetha] Or Ecbatana. This was occasioned by
the malice of the Jews adversaries; and proved a great furtherance to the
finishing of the Temple. Sic canes lingunt ulcera Lazari. All things work
together for good to them that love God, Venenum aliquando pro remedio fuit,
says Seneca. Rom, 8.28.


Verse 3. The height thereof threescore cubits] Yet was it less then Solomon's
Temple, Hag. 2.3. Ezra 3.12. Solomon's cubits therefore were longer (likely)
then these here mentioned.

Verse 4. Out of the Kings house] i. e. Out of the royal revenue in those
parts, chap. 7.20. Herodotus testifies, that Cyrus and Darius (who married his
daughter Atossa, and made him his pattern for imitation) were highly honored
among the Persians for their Kingly munificence: God has threatened that the
Nation and Kingdom, that will not serve the Church, shall perish: yea, those
Nations shall be utterly wasted, Esaias 60.12. See verse 12. of this chapter.

Verse 5. And also let the golden and silver vessels] This was decreed, and
this was done accordingly, chap. 1.7, 8. Let good resolutions be put in
execution: purpose without performance, is like a cloud without rain; and not
unlike Hercules his club in the Tragedy; of a great bulk, but stuffed with moss
and rubbish.

Verse 6. Be ye far from thence] i. e. Come not at them, to hinder them at all.
Thus, though the Churches enemies bandy together and bend all their forces
against her; yet are they bounded by Almighty God (who says unto them, Be ye
far from thence) as is the raging sea, Jer. 5.22. Surely (says the Psalmist)
the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shall thou
restrain, Heb. gird, that is, keep it within compass, as with a girdle. The
Septuagint render it thus, The remnant of wrath shall keep holy day to thee,
that is, it shall rest from working, or acting, how restless soever it be
within.

Verse 7. Let the work of this house of God alone] Meddle not, make no
disturbance: this was doubtless an hard task to them; for their spirits were
irked, as Moab, Number. 22. 3. and their fingers even itched at these builders.
They sleep not, except they may do mischief, Prove. 4.16.

Ver. 8. Moreover I make a Decree] So did some of the Heathen Emperors for the
persecuted Christians, Charles the fifth for the Lutherans (at the motion of
Albertus Archbishop of Ments, and Ludovicus Palatine of Rhine) and Henry the
third of France for the Protestants: which yet was but sorrily observed though
sworn to. It is written by an Italian (no stranger to the Court of Rome) that
their Proverb is, Mercatorum est, non regum stare juramentis, that it is for
Merchants, and not for Kings to keep to their oaths.

Verse 9. Of the God of heaven] Heathens have this notion by nature, that God
is the God of heaven, and that there He is, as in his place: howbeit we must
not conceive that God is commensurable by any place, since he fills all
places, and is every where all-present, totally present wheresoever present:
but in heaven is his glory most manifested, and on earth is he alone to be
worshipped.

Verse 10. That they may pray for the life of the King] For God, at his
pleasure, cutteth off the spirits of Princes, Psalm. 76.12. he crops them off
with ease, as one would do a flower; slips them off, as one would do a bunch of
grapes; as he dealt by Alexander the Great, Attilas that Terror of the world,
and King Henry the second of France, who upon the marriage of his sister to the
King of Spain, was so puffed up, that he called himself by a new title,
Tres-heureuse Roy, the thrice-happy King. But (to confute him) in solemnizing
that marriage, he was slain at Tilt, by the Captain of his guard (though
against his will, but not without Gods determinate counsel) in the very
beginning of his supposed happiness. Prove. 3^.
Death is the only King, against whom there is no rising up. The mortal sithe
is master of the royal Scepter (says one) and it moweth down the Lilies of
the Crown, as well as the grass of the field: pray therefore for the life of
the King, says this King here; let the Priests shout and say, Let the King
live for ever, Nehem. 2.3. (...).


And of his sonnes] Some of whom had soon died, say some: He therefore calls
for prayers for the preservation of the rest.

Verse 11. Let timber be pulled down from his house] 1. Let his house be
pulled down for a penalty. The Popish Council of Toulouse called together
against the Albigenses (those ancient Protestants) made this cruel
constitution; We decree that that house, wherein is found an Heretic, be
pulled down to the ground. 2. Let that timber be set up for a gibbet, and let
him be hanged thereon] Chald. destroyed. Compare that of the Apostle 1 Cor.
3.17, If any man destroy the Temple of God (which Temple ye are) him shall God
destroy: and let those look to it who turn it into a den of thieves, into a
brothel-house, slaughterhouse, pesthouse of noisome lusts, qui podicem ex ore
faciunt, by their unsavory speeches, and moile themselves worse then by
tumbling in a jakes.

Verse 12. And the God that has caused his name] i. e. his Word and true
worship, Acts 9.15. Psalm. 138.2. Mic. 4.5. 1 Kings 5.3, 5.

Destroy all Kings and people] A dreadful curse, and such as God says Amen to.
Let all persecutors, and Church-robbers look to themselves. Gods hand has ever
been very heavy upon such and their posterity. See Prove. 20.25. with the Note.

Let it be done with speed] It has been too much retarded and delayed
already: Let it now be expedited. David made haste and delayed not to keep Gods
Commandments, Psalm. 119.60. And Austin cries out, Nimis sero te amavi Domine.
It was a great burden to his good soul, that he began no sooner to love God. He
resolves therefore to redeem time, and to redouble his diligence; not leaving
till his soul was turned into a lump of love. Morus novissime omnium germinat;
and tamen parit inter primas. The Mulberry-tree buds last, but fruits with the
first.

Verse 13. So they did speedily] This they did, because they durst do no
otherwise: their obedience was wrung out of them, as verjuice is out of a crab,
or as distilled water is forced out by the heat of the fire. Thus some perform
duties, and yet hate them; part with sins, and yet love them. Show the
malefactor the rack, and he will say or do any thing. This is, to fear God
for his Lions, as those Mongrels did, 2 Kings 17.33, 34. t^^^re-s^rvili, non
^micali, Beda.
which yet may addere alas, left they fall under the lash, the correction of
the Law, for refusing the direction thereof.

Verse 14. And Artaxerxes] This is Xerxes (called also Ahashuerosh, husband of
Esther) or, as some think, Artaxerxes Longimanus, the son of Xerxes by
Esther; by whom the Temple finished before, might be much beautified, and,
happily, enlarged also.

Verse 15. And this house was finished] About fifteen years after that the
foundation had been laid, or twenty at most. The Jews therefore either were
out in their account, John 2.20. Forty and six years was this Temple in
building; or else they meant it of Herod's Temple, which was long in building
and beautifying, whereby he sought to ingratiate with the Jews, which yet he
could never do.

Verse 16. Kept the dedication -- with joy] So they did at the dedication of
the first Temple, 2 Chronicles. 7.10. God had required all his worships to be
celebrated with joy, Deuteronomy. 12.7. and made it a condition of an acceptable
service, Deuteronomy. 26.14. Sacrifices offered with mourning were abomination, Hos.
9.4. yea, accursed by God, Deuteronomy. 28.47. What a general joy was there at
Samaria, when Christ was first preached and believed on amongst them, Acts 8.8.
when they first became Gods building, 1 Cor. 3.9. a Temple for God to dwell in
and walk in, 2 Cor. 6.16? The like was at Bern, at Geneva, at Zurick, when the
reformed Religion was first received amongst them. They caused (for joy
thereof) the day and year to be engraven in a pillar in letters of gold, for a
perpetual memory to all posterity. Like as at Heidelberg, Anno, 1617. in the
Calends of November, Acts and Mon. Vita Parci operib. praefix.
they kept, for three days space, an Evangelical Jubilee, for joy of the
Reformation begun by Luther, an hundred years before.

Verse 17. An hundred bullocks, etc.] This little, (in comparison of what was
done at Solomon's dedication, 1 Kings 8.63.) was highly accepted in heaven: as
was likewise Noah's sacrifice, which yet could not be great: because that after
a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty
abounded unto the riches of their liberality (2 Cor. 8.2.) which, says
Aristotle, is not to be measured by the worth of the gift, (...). Ar. st.
Ethic. lib. 4.
but by the will of the Giver, See the Note on chap. 2.6.

Twelve he-goates] A fit creature for a sin-offering, because nasty, unruly,
etc.

According to the number of the tribes of Israel] All whom (wheresoever
dispersed) they remember in their prayers; as we should likewise do all the
Israel of God, in all places.

Verse 18. For the service of God] According to that, Exodus 12.25. Ye shall
keep this service, where the same word is used, that elsewhere serves to set
forth their servile service, Gnabhodah.
their bondage in Egypt. God lets them know that they must serve still, though
another Master, and after another manner. So Christ calls upon his, to take
his yoke upon them: Free though they be, yet they must not look to be
yokelesse, lawless, awlesse; but to serve God with reverence and godly fear,
Heb. 12.28.

As it is written in the book of Moses] Moses then was the Penman of the
Pentateuch, and not Ezra, as some have said; grounding upon that Apocryphal
Esdras.

Verse 19. And the children of the captivity] So the returned captives are
called, First, to keep still afoot the remembrance of their late misery, lest
they should despise the chastening of the Lord, Heb. 12.5. Secondly, to inmind
them of that signal mercy of their return to their own Country. Hence does
the Evangelist Matthew so often mention their transportation to Babylon, and
rings it in the ears of his ungrateful Contrymen, Mat. 1.11, 12, 17.

Kept the Passeover] In remembrance, that the punishing Angel passed over their
Ancestors in Egypt, Exodus 12. and for confirmation of their faith in Christ
the true Paschal Lamb. Have thou escaped a danger? offer a Passover. Has
Christ delivered thee from the wrath to come? keep the Feast with the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, 1 Cor. 5.8.

Upon the fourteenth day of the first moneth] See Exodus 12.2. with the Note.

Verse 20. Were purified together] Misery had framed them to unanimity. See 2 Chronicles. 29.34.

All of them were pure] Ritually at least, if not really.

And killed the Passeover] i. e. The Paschal Lamb, whereof see Exodus 12. with
the Notes.

For all the children] See the Note one verse 19.

And for themselves] For they also were sinners, and needed a Savior, Heb.
7.27. That Popish Postiller was utterly out, when from Exodus 30.31, 32. he will
needs infer that Priests, when once anointed with the holy oil, were
thenceforth Angels, Spirits, not having humane flesh, or infirmities.

Verse 21. And the children of Israel] The whole community, of what Tribe
soever.

And all such as had separated themselves] Who were the better to like, because
not Prosperity-proselytes, (such as came in (not a few) in Solomon's time; but
the Jews were very careful how they received them, as Josephus relates.

From the filthiness of the heathen] Who had filled the Land from one end to
the other with their uncleanness, Ezra 9.11. Great sins do greatly pollute.

To seek the Lord God of Israel] To seek not his omnipresence (for that none
need to do, since he is not far from any one of us, Acts 17.) but his gracious
presence. And such a seeker is every good soul, Psalm. 24.6. This is the
generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, that is Jacob.

Did eate] Edebant, id est, credebant, for even Christ their Passover was
sacrificed for them, 1 Cor. 5.7.

Verse 22. And kept the feast of unleavened bread] See 1 Cor. 7.8. and Exodus
12.35. with the Notes.

Seven dayes] This began on the fifteenth day, and lasted till the one and
twentieth day, Number. 28.16, 17. Exodus 34.25.

With joy] See the Note on verse 16.

For the Lord had made them joyful] Given them cause of joy, and an heart
enlarged accordingly, a mind right set for the purpose. Saint James his word
(...), chap. 5.13. shows, that all true mirth is from the rectitude of a man's
mind, which God only gives.

And turned the heart of the King, etc.] It is He alone that gives favor, that
frames men's opinions and affections, that makes a good man's enemies to be at
peace with him.

To strengthen their hands] As verse 8. And this did more ennoble him, then all
his warlike achievements.

CHAP. VII. Verse 1. Now after these things.
AFter that Zerubbabel had done his devoir in building the Altar and Temple,
Ezra, (according to the notation of his name) began his, and became a singular
helper of the afflicted Church of God, as appears in this Chapter, and those
that follow.

In the reign of Artaxerxes] sc. Longimanus, Esters son, and the same that
thirteen years after sent Nehemiah to Jerusalem, Nehem. 2. whilst Ezra was
yet alive, Nehem. 8.1.

Ezra the son of Seraiah] That is, the grand-sonne: for Seraiah was slain,
when Jerusalem was last taken, 2 Kings 25.18, 21.

Verse 2. The son of Shallum] See 1 Chronicles. 6.7, 8, 9, 10. Of those two books
of Chronicles this same Ezra is held to be the Penman: and it is not
improbable.

Verse 3. The son of Meraioth] Here Is a great heap: six of Ezra's ancestors
(likely for brevity sake) being overskipped.

Verse 4. The son of Zeraiah, etc.] These might be (as one says of Jesse the
father of David) Viri boni and honesti; minus tamen clari; good men, but
obscure.

Verse 5. The son of Aaron the chief Priest] Ezra then was ex genere
pontificio (as those, Acts 4.5.) non tamen pontifex. The title of chief Priest
is never given unto him.

Verse 6. This Ezra went up from Babylon] Together with many others, who were
moved thereunto by his example, and authority. He was (as one says of
Tiberius) imperio magnus, exemplo major. Paterc.
Great men are Looking-glasses, according to which most men dress themselves:
let them look to it therefore, and shine as Lamps.

And he was a ready Scribe] Or a nimble Text-man: his office was to write out
copies of the Law, and to interpret it. He wrote (say some) the Hebrew Bible
out in Chaldee letters (the same that we now call Hebrew, the ancient Hebrew
characters remained with the Samaritans) for the use of his Contrymen
returned out of Chaldea. He first ordained (say others) the Vowels, Accents and
Masoreth. A great Scholar he was, and excellently well seen in
Scripture-learning: to which all other skill is but straminea candela, a
rush-candle, a small light that serves but to light men into utter darkness.
Be wise, be learned, says the Psalmist: but withal Serve the Lord with fear,
Kiss the Son, etc. Psalm. 2. Balt. Exner.
Otherwise ye may be as learned as Varro that general Scholar; as Albertus
magnus, quem nihil penitus fugit, omnia perfect novit, who knew whatsoever was
knowable, Bonosius.
as one says of him: or as Tostatus (otherwise called Abulensis) qui omnium
scientiarum doctrinarumque arca fuit and emporium, says he that writes his
life; who was a living library: and yet ye may perish everlastingly. The Jews
called their learned men Scribes, as the Persians did theirs Magi; the French,
Druides; the Indians, Brachmanni, etc. But he that is not a Scribe instructed,
and instructing others to the Kingdom of heaven, Matthew. 13.52. shall hear,
Where is the wise? Where is the Scribe? Where is the disputer of this world?
Sapientes sapienter in infernum descendent. 1 Cor. 1.20, Aug.


Which the Lord God of Israel had given] The Moral Law, with his own immediate
mouth (so that he might say with Joseph, Genesis 45.12. Behold, your eyes see that
it is my mouth that speaks unto you) the other Laws he ordained by Angels in
the hand of a Mediator, i. e. of Moses, Gal. 3.19. Hence Josephus calls the
Jewish polity a Theocratie: and Prosper thinks, that they were called
Judaei, because they received jus Dei, the Law from God. But we can give a
better derivation from the Hebrew, viz. Jews, i. e. Confessors, such as were
those above, chap. 5.11.

And the King granted him all his request] Giving him more and greater things
then he durst desire. So great facility and flexiblenesse found He in this
King, that he needed only to ask, and give thanks: as it is said of Tiberius,
that he never denied his favorite Sejanus any thing; but oft-times prevented
his request, and avowed that he deserved much more.

According to the hand of the Lord his God upon him] i. e. his sweet and
singular providence, ever watching over, and working for those that are good, 2 Chronicles. 19. ult. Such may well sit and sing as one did once Vna est in trepida
mihi re medicina, Jehovae
Cor patrium, Os verax, omnipotensque Manus.


Verse 7. And there went up some of the children of Israel] And but some; for
many chose rather to continue in the Land of their captivity, though God by his
Prophets, and the King by his Proclamation had cried out, Ho, Ho, come forth,
etc.

Deliver thy self O Zion, that dwell with the daughter of Babylon, Zech.
2.6, 7. See the Note there.

And the Nethinims] See the Note on chap. 2.43.

Verse 8. And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth moneth] So that they were four
months in coming: and that which upheld them was, that they should shortly see
the face of God in Zion, Psalm. 84.7. Popish Pilgrims, though they have many a
weary step, and meet with much hardship, besides loss of their estates, yet
satisfy themselves in this, We have that we came for, viz. the sight of some
dumb Idol. What then should not we do or suffer to see God in his Ordinances,
in holy Assemblies?

Verse 9. According to the good hand of his God upon him] See the Note on verse
6. In all thy ways acknowledge God, and he shall direct thy paths, Prove. 3.6.
Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also upon Him, and he shall bring it to
pass, Ps. 37.5. Holy Ezra had experimented all this (as also had Eliezer, Genesis
24.) and therefore ascribes his good success to Gods good providence.

Verse 10. For Ezra had prepared his heart] Which, without due preparation,
would not have been drawn to any good. See 1 Samuel 7.3. Job 11.13. Amos 4.12.
An instrument must be tuned, ere it can be played upon: sour wines need good
sweetening.

To seek the Law of the Lord] To dive into the very bosom and bottom of it.
Qui nucleum vult, nucem frangat. The Rabbines have a saying, that there is a
mountain of sense hanging upon every tittle of Gods Law.

And to do it] His knowledge and practice ran parallel, and mutually transfused
warmth into one another. He was not of those Orators blamed by Diogenes, for
that they studied been dicere, non been facere, to speak commendably, but not
to live accordingly. He knew well that his forefathers (the High Priests) had
Pomegranates for savor, as well as bells for sound.

And to teach in Israel] He knew the truth of that Hebrew Proverb, Lilmod
Lelammed. Men must therefore learn, that they may teach others; and not bury
their talents, lest the canker of their great skill prove a swift witness one
day against them.

Verse 11. Even a Scribe of the words of the Commandments] This shows Ezra
was not an ordinary Scribe (called a Scribe of the people) nor a public
Notary, or Kings Secretary, such as were called for, Esth. 3. but Scriba sacer,
legis peritus, and interpres, a Teacher of the words of the Commandments of the
Lord and his Statutes to Israel. This is an high and honorable employment.

Ver. 12. Artaxerxes King of Kings] This is a very high style for any mortal
wight: yet ambitiously assumed by Monarchs and Emperors. It is indeed the
proper title of Jesus Christ, who has upon his vesture, and upon his thigh a
name written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: Kings and caytives, Socrates.
Lords and lossels are all his underlings and vassals, as those good Emperors
Constantine, Theodosius, and Valentinian usually called themselves. This Name
of the Lord Christ is said to be written, 1. On his Vesture, that all may see
it and submit to it. 2. On his thigh, where hangs his sword, to show his
absolute and illimited Empire, got out of the hands of his enemies with his
sword and with his bow, Psalm. 45.5. By me Kings reign, says He, Prove. 8.15.
And Nebuchadnezzar is made to know as much, Dan. 4.35. who once vain-gloriously
vaunted, that his Princes were altogether Kings, Esaias 10.8. Maximilian Emperor
of Germany also said of himself, that he was a King of Kings, but in another
sense: for every of my subjects (quoth He) will be a King: and say I what I
can, Joban. Manl. loc. com. p. 586.
they will do what they list.

Of the God of heaven] See the Note on chap. 5.11.

Verse 13. And of his Priests] sc. The God of heavens Priests, verse 12. and
therefore honored and respected by this great Monarch; so was Samuel by Saul,
Jaddus by great Alexander; the Bardes (anciently) here in Albion by the
greatest Commanders.

Which are minded of their own free-will] He would compel none: neither does
Almighty God. His people are all Voluntieres, Psalm. 110.3. Esaias 56.6. he finds
them not so, but makes them so; Ambros. in Ps. 1
and accounts that Virtus nolentium nulla est. Lex voluntarios quaerit. God
accepts a free will offering, and commands us to come off roundly and readily
in his service.

Verse 14. And of his seven Counsellours] Without whom the King did nothing of
moment. This King was better affected to his Council then his father Xerxes had
been; of whom it is storied, Val. Max. l. 9 c. 5
that in his expedition against Greece, he called his Princes together, as if
he would have been advised by them, but spoke to them to this purpose: Lest,
says he, I should seem to follow mine own counsel, I have assembled you. And
now do you remember, that it becomes you rather to obey, then advise.

To enquire concerning Judah] So Saint Paul sent to enquire what was yet
lacking in the faith of the Churches.

According to the Law of thy God] Which is not only recta, but regula, the
rule and rudder. Those that walked by this rule, Ezra was to cherish, and to
punish such as did otherwise, being custos utrinsque tabulae.

Which is in thine hand] Which thou art singularly skilled in, and much
exercised about it: that thou may both observe it thy self, and also
preserve it from other men's violations.

Verse 15. Which the King and his Councillors have freely offered] This King
as he had been well bred by his Mother Queen Esther, so he had (likely) been
well instructed by Ezra in the knowledge of the God of heaven (as he calls
him) whose service he thus promoteth. So Origin wrought much upon Alexander
Severus the Emperor by his sound doctrine and holy conversation: but
especially his mother Mammaea who became a great friend to the persecuted
Christians.

Verse 16. And all the silver and gold that thou can finde] And gold-thirsty
Babylon was not without great store of both; could the owners but find in
their hearts to part with it to so pious an use: Some did, and the rather
because the King and his Council began to them.

With the free will offering of the people] Gods select people, of whom Moses
sings, Happy art thou, O Israel! Who is like unto thee O people! Deuteronomy. 33.29.

Verse 17. That thou may buy speedily] Illico. God is himself a pure act,
and hates dullness in duty. What thou do, do quickly, said Christ, even to
the very Traitor that did seek and suck his blood.

Verse 18. And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, etc.] The King knew them to
be faithful and wise stewards (such as Hanani was, Nehem. 7.2.) and therefore
leaves much of the money to be bestowed as they pleased.

Verse 19. The vessels also, etc.] How naturally seems this King to care for
the service of God! and what pity is it that he should so often call Him Your
God, and Thy God, and not own him for his! So hard a thing it is to relinquish
that vain conversation that people have received by tradition from their
fathers. I will never forsake the Religion that I have received from my
forefathers, said Tully; And the Monarch of Morocco told the English
Ambassador; that he had lately read Saint Paul's Epistles, and liked them so
well, that were he now to choose his Religion, he would, before any other,
embrace Christianity. But every one ought, said he, to die in his own
Religion: and the leaving of the faith wherein he was borne, was the only
thing that he disliked in that Apostle.

Verse 20. And whatsoever more, etc.] What could this King say more to seal up
his good affection to the work in hand? Shall not this liberal Heathen rise up
in judgment and condemn such hold-fasts amongst us, such miserly
money-hoarders, as have no quicksilver, no current money for God or any good
uses; but are, the richer the harder, as Dives?

Verse 21. Let it be done speedily] Without shucking and hucking, without
delays and consults: I, even I will have it so, says the great King: dispute
not therefore, but dispatch: Quod ego volo, pro canone sit, as Constantius the
Emperor said to Paulinus, Lucifer, and other dissenting Bishops.

Verse 22. Unto an hundred talents of silver] This was no small sum. How
chargeable was the service of God heretofore, to what it is now? and yet how
heavily do men come off, when to expend, though but a very small sum that
way. Ad quid perditio haec? To what end is this waste? is the common cry in
this case. Surely Pagans and Papagans who lavish money out of the bag without
measure, dotantque Deos alienos (as some read that text, Psalm. 16.3.) shall
have an easier judgment then such pinch-penny professors.

Verse 23. For why should there be wrath] Heb. Boiling or foaming anger, great
indignation, as it is rendered, and made the utmost degree of the divine
displeasure, Deuteronomy. 29.28. Of all things God cannot endure to be slighted, and
to have his service neglected: this, blind nature saw, and was therefore
sedulous herein to prevent wrath. Aristotle has this divine precept, (...).
Make Religion thy first and chief care, Arist. polit. l. 7. c. 8.
that thou may prosper, etc. Let our worship-scorners look to it: do they
provoke the Lord to wrath? are they stronger then He? will they bring Gods
vengeance upon us all?

Against the Realm, the King and his sonnes] For God is higher then the
highest, and will rain down indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish
upon every soul of man that does evil, or that neglects to do good: for
not-serving of God, Romans 2.8, 9.
not-sacrificing is a sin, Mal. 3.18. Eccles. 9.2. And sin does as naturally
draw and suck judgments to it, both personal and public, as the loadstone
does iron, or Turpentine fire.

Verse 24. And also we certify you, that touching any of the Priests;] These
he takes special order for, that they be freed from public payments: and the
like care was taken by our Ancestors for the Ministers of the Church of
England, as appears by Magna Charta, chap. 14. Their maintenance is of the
Law of Nature, Genesis 47.22, Jezabel provided for her Priests; Idolatrous Micah
for his Levite; the Papists for their shavelings, granting them many and great
immunities, and being so free to them, that there was need of a Statute of
Mortmain providing that men should give no more to the Church. But tempora
mutantur, etc.

Verse 25. And thou Ezra] Qui monet ut facias, etc.

After the wisdom of God that is in thine hand] That is in thine heart and
life. Sapientia est vel

codicibus cordibus
Ezra had both these, being a thorough wise man.

All such as know the Laws of thy God] Else how shall they see them duly
executed? How shall they be as so many living Laws, walking Statutes? How
shall they teach in the Cities of Judah, as Jehosaphats Judges did, 2 Chronicles.
17.7, 9. and as it follows here, And teach ye them that know them not; How
can the people perform their duty, which they are ignorant of?

Verse 26. And whosoever will not do the Law of thy God.] In the first place,
and then the Kings Law, as it is subordinate and subservient to Gods Obediemus
Atridis honesta mandan^ibus, non aliter, In Iphigenia.
says He in Euripides: If the King command honest things, we will obey him;
otherwise not.

Let judgment be speedily executed upon him] Let this be noted against those
that hold, that Magistrates have nothing to do with men in matters of Religion.
Artaxerxes here interposeth, and Ezra blesses God for it. See Dan. 3.29. Deuteronomy.
13.6. Romans 13.4. 1 Pet. 2.13, 14.

Verse 27. Blessed be the Lord God] Deo gratias is ever in a good man's mouth.
The Jews at this day are bound to say an hundred Benedictions every day; and
more as occasion requires. Leo Modena


Verse 28. And has exercised mercy unto me] sc. By making use of my service,
for the promoting of his. Any employment about God, is an high preferment, and
so to be esteemed; yea, it is a mercy, and seals up farther mercy.

CHAP. VIII. Verse 1. These are now the chief of their fathers.
THe chieftaines of those that went up with Ezra, beside those that went up at
first with Zerubbabel.

Verse 2. Of the sons of Phineas] The son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron,
that renowned Zelot, with whom, and his seed after him, God gave a Covenant of
peace, even the Covenant of an everlasting Priesthood, Number. 25.12, 13.

Daniel] Not the Prophet Daniel, Gods darling, Dan. 9.23. but another of the
same name, which might be some help to him.

Of the sons of David] sc. Of David the King. See 1 Chronicles. 3.22.

Verse 3. Of the males an hundred and fifty] Great account was made of males
under the Law, Blounts voyage.
more then of the females: and so there is to this day among the Jews, who
hold women to be of a lower creation, made only for the propagation and
pleasure of man, etc. This their conceit is their folly, yet their posterity
approve their sayings. He did better who styled woman the second Edition of the
Epitome of the whole world. Sure it is, that souls have no sexes; and in
Christ, there is no respect had more to the male then female, Gal. 3.28.

Verse 4. Of the sons of Pahath-Moab] Happily so called, because some of his
progenitors had dwelt in Moab. He was a Covenanter, Neh. 10.14.

Verse 5. The son of Jahaziel] The father is named, but not the son: but
why, who can tell? Et patet and lucet pagina sacra.

Verse 6. Of the sons also of Ad^i] A Covenanter too, Neh. 10.16.

Verse 7. Jesbaiah] Of the same name, but not the same man that is mentioned,
verse 19.

Verse 8. The son of Michael] A name afterward given to Jesus Christ, Dan.
10.13. Rev. 12.7. signifying, Who is as God? Hence some conceive, that it is
not so fit to call a child Michael, Emmanuel, etc.

Verse 9. Obadiah the son of Jehiel] This Obadiah, (as also Zechariah, verse
11. and Azgad; verse 12.) sealed the Covenant, Nehem. 10. not without oath, and
execration. It is both lawful, and in some cases needful, for good people,
solemnly to bind themselves to bounden duties. Hereby, says a grave Divine,
as true intention, earnest desire, prudent jealousy and holy zeal are
manifested, so is a dull spirit much quickened, and the weak, wayward,
revolting flesh bridled and curbed: yea, and bound to her good behavior.

Verse 10. The son of Josiphiah] See verse 5.

Verse 11. Zechariah the son of Bebai] See verse 9.

Verse 12. And the sons of Azgad] See verse 9.

Verse 13. And of the sons of Adonikam] Some of his sons went up before
with Zerubbabel, chapter 2.13. Eposteris posterioribus Tremel
These not till now, together with Ezra. They might want either age or hearts
to go at first with their brethren. Second thoughts are best many times: and
Nunquam jero, si serio. That son in the Gospel, who being bidden go work to
day in the Vineyard, answered and said, I will not, but afterward repented,
and went, wanted not his commendation, Matthew. 21.29. A learned man descanteth
thus upon this Text: The lot of Adonikam was below his brethren, because he was
the last that set foot forward toward their return.

Verse 14. And with them seventy males] The whole company consisted of one
thousand four hundred, ninety and six males: a good addition to those that went
up before with Zerubbabel; yet nothing so many as might have been, but that
they wanted hearts.

Rari quippe boni; numero vix sunt totidem, quot
Thebarum portae, vel divitis ostia Nili. Juvenal. Sat. 13.

Verse 15. And I gathered them together to the River] There was their first
Rendevous, at the meeting of two Rivers; whereof that Country was full, Psalm.
137.1 and therefore fertile as the Garden of the Lord, whereof it was a part,
as most Geographers are of opinion.

And there abode we in tents] Glad we had our faces set toward Zion (going
weeping, etc. Jer. 50.4, 5) and our backs upon Babylon; of which we might well
say, as the Philosopher afterward did of Athens, that it was a pleasant place
to travel thorough, but not safe to dwell in.

And found there none of the sons of Levi] None but what he afterward sent
for; no volunteers: this was lamentable, that Levites should be so backward to
so good a business. Here was nomen inane, crimen immane.

Verse 16. Men of understanding] Of special note for their wisdom and
eloquence: such as could present to the people good matter well habited, and
could well express their expositions of the Law; being themselves wise, and
willing to wise others, as the Hebrew word signifies, Dan. 12.3. Men of
understanding and ready to instruct many, Dan. 11.33. Such a man as this, is
worth his weight in gold.

Verse 17. At the place Casiphia] Where it may seem that there was a College
of Levites, and Iddo was their President.

And to his brethren the Nethinims] Who were now become men of Mark, brethren
to Iddo, and much sought for by Ezra: see Chap. 2.43. for the service they did
about Gods house.

Verse 18. Pausanias.
And by the good hand of God upon us] God was in all this good man's thoughts:
he set upon every passage, (as the Ancients did upon every special piece of
work they did) (...). This was the only way to make his journey comfortable
thus to converse with God all along, and Paradisum mente deambulare, as Hierome
counseled the young Hermit; assuring him that so long as he had Paradise in
his mind, and God in his apprehensions, tamdin in eremo non esset, so long he
should not be in a desert.

They brought us a man of understanding] The Hebrew word Shacal signifies
three things, 1. To understand. 2. To instruct. 3. To prosper. Those that
understand themselves, and teach others, shall do much good to themselves and
others. See the Note on verse. 16. This egregie cordatus homo was Sherebiah, as
it follows here, and Sherebiah or, even Sherebiah, confer Neh. 8.7. and 9.4,
5.

Verse 19. And Hashabiah] A man ready to every good work, Neh. 3.17. and 10.11.
and that is no small commendation.

Verse 20. Whom David and the Princes had appointed i.e. continued, confirmed,
and ordered them: for they were first appointed and designed to that service by
Joshuah; and thence called Nethinims.

All these were expressed by Name] Verbis non solum difertis, sed and exsertis.

Verse 21. Then I proclaimed a fast there] A day of restraint from food, fine
clothes, and other delights of life. There is a three-fold-fast, says One;
from meat, from mirth, and from sin: this last crowns all. Unless God sees
turning, he sees no work in a fast, says another, descanting upon that Text,
Jon. 3.10. God saw their works, that they turned. Of a Fast see the Notes on
Joel 2.12.

That we might afflict our selves before our God] Not outwardly only (that is
but the shell Is. 58.3.) but inwardly, also, for that is the kernel of this
exercise, Jer. 16.29. which else is but bodily, and profits little;
something, it may, as it did Ahab: But if rightly performed though it weakeneth
the body, yet it strengthens the spirit, making it vigorous and victorious.

To seek of him a right way for us] To edge our prayers and give wings to them:
for fasting inflameth prayer, and prayer sanctifies fasting: hence they go
coupled for the most part, Luk 2.37. Matthew. 17.21. 1 Cor. 7.5. And surely, if
with fasting and prayer we can seek of God direction and protection as here, we
shall speed of both.

And for our little ones] These should be a main part of our care, to lay up
prayers for them, to commend them to Gods safe-keeping, forasmuch as puerilitas
est periculorum pelagus, Little ones are liable to a thousand deaths and
dangers.

And for all our substance] Our stock and our store, all the goods that we have
got and gathered together. Our English word Riches answers to the Hebrew
Recush.

Verse. 22. For I was ashamed] Heb: I blushed and was abasht, I knew not how to
put on the face to do it, neither could I bring my mind to crave a convoy,
though it might have been of great use to us: lest the name of God should
thereby be dishonored, and his excellencies questioned. It is the ingenuity of
Saints to study Gods ends more then their own, and to be far more troubled when
any thing crosses him, then when themselves are crossed or disappointed.
Propter te Domine, propter te, is the good man's Motto. Choice and excellent
spirits are all for God, whatever becomes of themselves.

Verse. 22. Because we had spoken to the King, saying] They had spoken good of
Gods Name, and amply set forth his power, providence, goodness, and other
Attributes, being no whit ashamed so to do before Kings, as Psalm. 119.46. so
did Chrysostom, Basil, Latimer, Lambert, John Colet, Dean of Paul's, and
Founder of the Free School there. He, for the bold and faithful discharge of
his duty, in a Sermon before Hen. the eighth at the siege of Tournay was called
to his trial by the Kings Counselors: but the issue proved happy: for he gave
so great content to the King, M. Clark in his Life.
that he taking a cup of Wine said, Deane, I drink to you: let every one take
whom he will for his Confessor, you shall be my Doctor. Holy Ezra found no
less favor with this might Monarch, whom he had well informed in the manifold
excellencies of God, as appears by this and sundry other preceding passages.

The hand of our God is upon all them, etc.] To hide them in the hollow of it
till the indignation be overpast; to hold them by their right hand, and so to
guide them by his Counsel, that he may afterward take them to his glory, Psalm.
73.23, 24.

But his power and his wrath] Id est, His powerful wrath, his anger armed with
power; for vanae sine viribus irae; Psalm. 90.11. Jam. 4 10.
But who knows the power of thine anger, says Moses? even according to thy
fear so is thy wrath. Let him fear thee never so much, he is sure to feel thee
more, if once he fall into thy fingers; into that mighty hand of thine (as St.
James styles it) before which ten thousand Kings cannot stand. Let
God-forsakers therefore do as those Elders of Israel did, 2 Kings 10.3, 4, 5.

Is against all them that forsake him] Such are all they, 1. That forsake not
their sins, Job 20.17. Isa. 55.7. 2. That know not God, Isa. 1.3, 4. Ephesians. 4.18.
3. That trust to idols, or creature comforts, arm of flesh. 1 Kings 9.9. Josh.
24.20. Jer. 2.13. 4. Church-forsakers, and Apostates, Heb. 10.25, 38. God has
against all these, and will consume them after that he has done them good,
Josh. 24.20. Psalm. 73.27. 1 Chronicles. 28.9. Jon. 2.8. Jer. 17.13. Deuteronomy. 31.16. 2 Chronicles. 12.5. and 15.2. and 24.20.

Verse 23. So we fasted] They put their holy resolution into execution: purpose
without practice is like Rachel, beautiful, but barren.

And besought our God for this] And they had it, 2 Samuel 1.22.
Verse 31. For fasting and prayer are like Jonathans bow and Saul's sword, that
never turned back, or returned empty. God is a liberal Rewarder of all such as
in this sort diligently seek him, Heb. 11.6. 2 Chronicles. 15.2. He will turn their
fasting into feasting, their prayers into praises, Ezekiel 36.37. Zech. 8.19. They
shall have out their prayers either in money, or monies-worth: either in the
very thing they desired, or at least strength to stay themselves upon God, with
good assurance that his grace shall be sufficient for them, and that he will be
their shield, and their exceeding great reward.

Verse 24. Then I separated twelve] I singled them and set them apart for this
great trust, vide cui fidas.

Sherebiah, Hoshabiah] Heb. With Sherebiah, Hoshabiah, (men of known integrity,
Verse. 18.19.) and ten of their brethren with them] four and twenty in all, a
complete company of faithful Trustees.

Verse 25. And weighed unto them] Heb. I scaled it out unto them: Cyrus taled
it out to Zerubbabel. Chap. 1.8, 9, etc.

And his Lords] Called Mighty Princes, Chap. 7.28. see Isa. 10.8.

And all Israel there present] Heb. There found at that time, or that had found
in their purses, found in their hearts.

Verse 26. Six hundred and fifty talents of silver] That is, 243750 pounds
sterling.

An hundred talents] That is 37500 pounds sterling.

Verse 27. Of a thousand drammes] 312 pounds and 10 shillings. The Hebrew (or
rather Chaldee) word here rendered a Dram seems to be taken from the Greek
word (...).

And two vessels of fine Copper] Ex orichalco praestante, Of some choice mixed
mettle, Auro contra non caro.

Verse 28. Ye are holy to the Lord] Heb. Ye are holiness unto the Lord: and
must sanctify the holy God in righteousness, Esa. 5.16.

The vessels are holy also] Id est, set apart to sacred uses; and therefore to
be kept carefully, used respectively. The Turks spare and keep better then
ordinary, Grand Sign. Serag.
those very Asses of theirs that have been used for carriage to Mecha, where
their Mahomet lies buried: Neither will they put paper to any base use,
because that both the Name of God, and the Mohammedan Law are written upon the
like.

Verse 29. Watch ye] with utmost care, and solicitude, as the word signifies.
How much more should we watch and trebble watch, (as Luke 12.37, 38, 43.) to
keep our vessels (bodies) in sanctification and honor, Not in the lust of
concupiscence, etc? especially since, Aug.
Adversus majora vigilantibus quaedam in cautis minutiora surrepant, and Satan
works strongest on the fancy, when the soul is sleepy, or a little drowsy.
Watch ye therefore and keep: This lesson had need to be often rung in our ears.

Verse 30. So took the Priests and the Levites] The great charge committed to
them, and laid upon them, did not weaken, but waken their heroik spirits.

Tu non creed malis, sed contra audentior ito. Verse 31. And of such as lay in
wait by the way] Enemies they had not a few (when was it otherwise?) but some,
that purposely waylaid them; M Clarks Lives.
but were defeated by a gracious providence. So were the Manichees who lay in
wait for Austin: and those that pursued Jewel about the beginning of Q. Mary's
Reign, as he was going from Oxford to London. Both these had been caught, and
made a prey to their Enemies, but that they lost their way; What says the
Prophet? As Birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem (like as
when the young are in danger of the kite, the Bird flies to save them)
defending also, he will deliver it and passing over, he will preserve it.

Verse 32. And abode there three dayes] For necessary refreshment, after so
long a journey. The body is the souls servant, and must therefore be kindly and
fairly dealt with, Corpus sive corpor, quasi cordis por, id est, paer, sive
famulus.
ut sit par negotio, that it may be neither above not below its business; but
even with it, meet for it.

Verse 33. Now on the fourth day] Viz. of their fifth month. After a short
repose they set close to work. To recreations God allows men to stoop for
their bodies sake, as the Eagle to the prey: or as Gideons Soldiers to soop
their handful, not to swill their belly full.

Verse 34. By number and by weight, etc.] In reference to this Text, Let thy
confession be full, says a reverend man: bring out thy sins as those in Ezra
did the vessels of the Temple, by number and by weight, 1. By Number, Lev.
16.21. Aaron was to confess over the escape goat all the iniquities of the
children of Israel. 2. By weight he was to confess all their trangressions in
all their sins: that is, laying open how many transgressions were wrapped up in
their several sins, and their circumstances.

Verse 35. Also the children of those that had been] In token of presenting
their bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God their Deliverer,
Romans 12.1. Let us that are freed from sins slavery, become the servants of
righteousness, Romans 6.18. and being delivered from the hands of our Enemies,
serve God without fear in holiness and righteousness all the days of our
lives, Luke 1.74.75.

Verse 36. And they furthered the people] Heb. They gave them a lift, lent them
an helping hand: not out of love to the work, but for fear of the King, and in
pursuance of his commands and commissions. Thus the Devil and his impes
sometimes do Gods will, though with an ill will, Psalm. 119.91. They continue
this day according to thine Ordinances: for all are thy servants. How much
better were it to work from a right principle, not by constraint, but
willingly; not for fear of wrath, but of a ready mind, 1 Pet. 51
to love to be Gods servants taking hold of his Covenant, Isai. 56.6. and
saying to him, as the people did to Joshua, Chap. 1.16. or as the Rulers and
Elders to Jehu, 2 Kings 10.5. We are thy servants, and will do all that thou
shall bid us?

CHAP. IX. Verse 1. Now when these things were done.]
HEre are post maxima gaudia luctus, Heavens joys are without measure or
mixture: But this present life is overspred with sins and miseries, as with a
filthy morphew. Of good Ezra we may say as Pliny does of Metellus; Metellus
infelix dici non debet, felix non potest, Lib. 7. c. 47.
Unhappy we may not call him, happy we cannot: witness the doleful discourse
of this Chapter.

The Princes came unto me] The better sort of them that were sensible of the
abuses crept in, and desired a Reformation. For some of the Princes also and
Rulers had their hands elbow-deep, in the wickedness complained of Verse 2.

The people of Israel] The Many, (...)
the common sort, that shallow-braind, but many-headed Beast, that loves to
follow the herd and do as the most do, though thereby they be utterly undone
for ever.

And the Priests, and the Levites] This was much: for these knew the Law, and
made their boast of it, Romans 2.18.23. They could not be ignorant of the
unlawfulness of this mixing themselves in marriage with Heathens not
proselyted. Now sins against knowledge and conscience are of a double dye, of a
crymson color: and make a great breach, a deep gash in a man's spirit. Esaias
59.11, 12. What was it that brought such roarings and troubles on them, and
that, when salvation was looked for? Our iniquities testify to our faces, and
we know them.

Have not separated themselves] The separation of the Saints from the wicked is
a wonderful separation, Exodus 33.16. such as was that of light from darkness
in the creation. God has brought them out of darkness into his mavelous
light. Why then should they be unequally yoked together with unbeleevers? what
communion has light with darkness, etc? 2 Cor. 6.14. 1 Pet. 2.


Doing according to their abominations] How should they choose but do so, when
so matched and married? what is the reason the Pope will not dispense in Spain
or Italy, if a Papist marry a Protestant? yet here they will, but in hope
thereby to draw more to them. The brown bread in the Oven will be sure to
fleece from the white; not that from it. So in married couples: seldom is the
worse bettered by the good, but the contrary. See Nehem. 13.26.

Verse 2. For they have taken of their daughters] Taken them for wives: which
was fllatly forbidden, Deuteronomy. 7.3. and a reason given, ver. 4. from the evil
effect of such unblest marriages. This abuse Malachi complains of, chap.
2.11, 13. whom some make to be the same man with Ezra.

For themselves and for their sons] Whom they herein helped to a cold arm-ful,
(as Lycophron calls a bad wife:) or rather to an unnatural heat, worse then
that of a quartan ague, (...).
as said Simonides: as bad as that of an evil spirit, said another Heathen.

So that the holy seed] Id est, The children of Israel, who were all federally
holy at least, Deuteronomy. 7.6. as are also all the children of Christian Parents, 1
Cor. 7.14.

Has been chief in this trespasse] Which they think audaciously to bear out
with their big looks, to obtrude and justify to the World this most malapert
misdemeanour, because it is facinus majoris abollae, the fact of a great one.

Verse 3. Juvenal.
I rent my garments and my mantle] In token of his deep and downright
humiliation, indignation, detestation of their dealings herein.

And plucked ^ff the hair of my head, and of my beard] To show how passionately
grieved and offended he was. The raging Turk did the like at the last assault
of Scodra: being extremely vexed at the dishonor and loss he had received
there. But what followed? In his choler and frantic rage, Turk. Hist.
he most horribly blasphemed God: whereas holy Ezra, though he sat astonished
till the Evening sacrifice, yet then he pours forth his soul in an heavenly
prayer, verse 5, 6.

And sat down astonied] As one that has neither life nor soul, (as we say)
that can neither say nor do for himself, being wondrously amazed, astonished,
or desolate, as David had been, Psalm. 143.4. The true Zealot, as his love is
fervent, his desires eager, his delights ravishing, his hopes longing; so his
hatred is deadly, his anger fierce, his grief deep, his fear terrible, etc.
Zeal is an extreme heat of all the affections, Romans 12.11. boyling-hot,
hissing-hot, as the Greek imports. (...).


Verse 4. Then were assembled unto me] It was soon noysed and noticed among the
godly party, how exceedingly Ezra was troubled: they therefore trouble
themselves, as our Savior is said to have done John. 11.33. and as Paul felt
twinges when others were hurt. Who is offended says he, and I burn not? Sheep
when frighted, will get together; 2 Cor. 11.29.
Swine, when lugged, will grunt together. What should Saints do, (in case of
National sins or judgments) but assemble and tremble together, as here; but vow
and perform Reformation to the Lord their God, as in the next chapter?

Every one that trembled at the words] At the judgments of God whilst they
yet hang in the threatenings. To such looks the Lord, with special
intimations of his love, Isa. 66.2. When as those that tremble not in hearing,
shall be crushed to pieces in feeling, said Mr. Bradford the Martyr.

That had been carried away] But had not learned by the thing that they had
suffered, were as bad as before, if not worse, having lost the fruit of their
afflictions. (...).
This is fearful: a sad sign of an incorrigible castaway, Jer. 6.30.

Until the Evening-sacrifice] This time of the day good people, usually took
to pray at: that, together with the sacrifice, their prayers might come up for
a memorial before God in those pillars of smoke, Cant. 3.6. Act. 10.4. See Luke
1.10. Act. 3.11.

Verse 5. I rose up from my heavinesse] In affliction, sc. of spirit, wherewith
his heart was leavened and sowred, as David's was, Psalm. 73.21. Imbittered as
Peter's, Matthew. 26. ult. powered out upon him as Jobs, chap. 30.16. He did really
afflict himself with voluntary sorrows for the transgressions of his people.

And having rent, etc.] See ver. 3.

I fell upon knees] This gesture did both evidence, and increase the ardency of
his affection.

And spread out my hands] With the palms open toward Heaven in an having
craving way, as Beggars. This was the Jewish manner of praying; and it was very
becoming.

Verse 6. And said, O my God] This was a prayer of faith, and founded upon the
Covenant, that bee-hive of Heavenly honey, as One well calls it.

I am ashamed and blush] Sin is a blushful thing and hales shame at the heels
of it, Illum ego periisse dico cui periit pudor. Sallust.
Rev. 3.17. Therefore when a man has committed a sin, he blusheth: the blood
as it were, would cover the sin. But he is past grace that is past shame, and
can blush no more then a sackbut.

For our iniquities] He makes himself a party, because he was one of the same
Community with them that had done that evil. He also knew himself to have an
hand if not upon the great cart-ropes, set upon the lesser cords that might
draw down divine vengeance upon the Land. Hence he includes himself after the
example of Daniel, chap. 9.5.

Are increased over our heads] As an overwhelming flood, Psalm. 38.4. That
threateneth to go over our souls too, Psalm. 124.4. and to sink them in the
bottomless lake, that lowermost part of hell imported by that (...) locale (as
Hebricians Note) Psalm. 9.17.

And our trespass is grown up unto the Heavens] So great is our guilt, that
it is gotten as high as Heaven, that is, as high as may be. For beyond the
moveable Heavens, Aristotle (Natures best Secretary) says there is neither
body, nor time, nor place, nor vacuum. De Coelo Text. 99.
See Revel. 18.5. with the Note. Man's sin defiles even the very visible
Heavens; which must therefore be purged with the fire of the last day. Yea it
pierces into the Heavens of Heavens, and makes a loud outcry in gods ears
for vengeance, Genesis 4.10. and 18.20.

Verse 7. Since the days of our Fathers] Confession with aggravation is that
happy Sponge, that wipeth out all the blottes and blurres of our lives: for, if
we confess our sins, and therein lay load enough upon our selves, as Ezra
here, and Daniel does c. 9.5. (mark how full in the mouth these good men are,
out of the abundant hatred of sin in their hearts) God is faithful and just to
forgive us our sins, etc. 1 John 1.9. But in confession we must not extenuate
or excuse: every sin, must swel as a toad in our eyes, and we must spet it out
of our mouths with utmost indignation; showing the Lord the iniquity of our
sin, the filthiness of our lewdness, the abomination of our provocations,
Romans 7.13. Thus if we weigh our sins in a true balance, and put in so many
weights, as to bring to a just humiliation, to a godly sorrow; then it will
prove a right Apology, the same that the Apostle makes a fruit and sign of
sound repentance 2 Cor. 7.11. Chennit. Exam.
quae magis deprecatione constat, quam depulsione criminum, such an Apology as
consists rather in deprecating, then defending.

We havebeen in a great trespass unto this day] And so there has bin a
concatenation, a continued series of our sins from one generation to another.
We are a race of Rebels, a seed of serpents, etc.

And for our inquities have we, our Kings and our Priests] Our National sins
have produced National plagues; which yet we have not improved to a public or
personal reformation. Many hands have drawn the cable with greatest violence;
the leprosy has overrun the whole body: there is (as Physicians say of some
diseases) corruption totius substantiae, a general defection, a conjuncture, of
all persons, in all sins and miseries, which like clouds cluster together, and
no clearing up by repentance.

And to confusion of face,] So that we are a scorn to our Enemies, and a
terror to our selves, in a low and lamentable condition.

Verse 8. And now for a little space] Heb. point, or moment of time. God let
loose his hand for a while, and gave them some little liberty, to make them
instances of his mercy, who had been objects of his wrath: but nothing would
mend them and make them better.

And to give us a nail] that is, some settlement, some subject of hope, and
support of faith. He seems to allude to such nails as wherewith they
fastened their tents to the ground ( Jael drove one of those Tent-nails
thorough Sisera's Temples, and laid him safe enough) or else to those nails
that, driven into pales, do fasten them to their nails.

That our God may lighten our eyes] Id est, Cheer up our hearts, and so clear
up our eyesight: which, when the spirit is dejected, grows dim, for want of
spirits. Profecto oculis animus inhabitat, says Pliny; Truly so it is, that
the heart dwells in the eye: there it sits and shows it self pleased or
displeased with whatsoever occurrences. And as a looking-glass is the eye of
art: so is the eye the looking-glass of nature. Lib, 2. cap. 32.


And to give us a little reviving in our bondage] Not light only, but heat
also by the beams of his pleased countenance, which is better then life. The
life of some kinds of creatures is merely in the Sun; In Winter they lie for
dead: in Summer, they revive. So it is with the Saints: all their comfort
consists in Gods grace and favor. They look unto him and are lightened, Psalm.
34.5. he hides his face and they are troubled; their breath is taken away,
they die and return to their dust, Psalm. 104.29. These captives in Babylon lay
for that time as dead and buried, Esaias 26.19. God opened their graves, and
caused them to come up cut of their graves, and brought them to the land of
Israel. Ezekiel. 37.13. For his favor is no empty favor: It is not like the
Winter-sun that casts a Goodly countenance when it shines, but gives little
comfort and heat. He is the Father of lights, and the God of all grace and
consolation, etc. he gives all things needful to life and godliness, so that
to have sinned against so good a God, to kick against such tender bowels, was a
further aggravation of their sin: and so it is here used and urged.

Verse 9. For we were bondmen] Heb. servants; and so wholly and only at the
pleasure of another: for a servant not (...), says Aristotle, one that moves
absolutely of himself: but he is the Masters underling and instrument, (...),
wholly at his dispose. The Saints may say all as much. We were bondmen, slaves
to sin, drudges to the devil, driven about by him at his pleasure, having as
many Lords as lusts, Tit. 3.3. and thereby exposed to a thousand mischiefs and
miseries: The Heathens Pistrinum, the Turks Gallyes, Bajazets iron Cage, the
Indian mines are nothing to it. This we should frequently recognize; and
remembering that our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but brought us
from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that we might
receive forgiveness of sin, and inheritance among them which are sanctified;
Act 26.18.
we should blush and bleed in the sense of our unthankfulness, saying as ver.
14, should we again break thy Commandments, etc.

Yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage] As he may seem to do his
prisoners of hope, when he leaves them in the Enemies hand, or under some
pressing affliction, and seems to forget them, that they may the better
remember themselves. But God had remembered these returned captives in their low
estate; for his mercy endures for ever: And had redeemed them from their
Enemies, for his mercy endures for ever; Psalm. 136. 23.24. Their sin therefore
was the greater, since against so much mercy: and God might justly have said
unto them as Ezekiel. 22.20. I will gather you in my anger and in my fury, and will
leave you there. A grievous judgment indeed! for woe be unto you when I forsake
you, Hos. 9.12. Lord leave us not, Jer. 17, 17. Forsake us not utterly, Psalm.
119.8.

To give us reviving] See Ver. 8.

To set up the House of our God, and to repair. etc.] He recites and
celebrateth Gods favors to that people, not in the lump only and by
wholesale, as we say: but enters into particulars, and reckons them up one
by one: so does Moses, Exodus 18.8. So does David, Psalm. 136. So must we, that
we may shame and shent our selves as here for our unthankfulness: and be
inrited and inciced thereby to better obedience. God, for this cause, crumbleth
his mercies unto us (says One:) we have his blessings by retail, that we may
make our utmost of them.

And to give us a Wall] Protection and safeguard, as the Walls of Sparta was
their Militia, and the Walls of England, is our Navy. They had the fence of the
King of Persia's favor. They had also Gods providence as an hedge or wall of
fire round about them, Zech. 2.5. See the Note there.

Verse 10. And now Our God what shall we say after this?] q.d. We have nothing
to say for our selves, wherefore thou should not presently pronounce against
us, and execute upon us the sentence of utter rejection. We are even
speechless, excuselesse, and must needs conclude. It is the Lords mercy that
we are not consumed, that we are at al on this side hell: it is because his
compassions fail not, Lam. 3.32.

For we have for saken thy Commandements] Better then this Ezra could not have
said for himself and his people, whilst he thus confesses sin, and puts
himself into the hands of justice, in hope of mercy. In the courts of men it is
safest to say, Non feci, I did it not (says Quintilian.) But in our addresses
unto God, it is best to say, Ego feci, miserere; I did it, oh be merciful unto
me O God, be merciful unto me. Per miserere mei, tollitur ira Dei.

Verse 11. Which thou have commanded us by thy servants the Prophets] Whose
office it was to expound the Law to us, and to apply it to our consciences.
This although they have done daily and duly, yet we have not been kept within
the bounds of obedience, but have flown against the lights, (as Bats use to
do,) and sinned presumptuously. Thus he aggravateth their sin, by every
circumstance. And this is right confession, such as the Schoolmen have set
forth in this Tetrastick.

Sit simplex, humilis confessio, pura, fidelis,
Atque frequens, nuda and discreta, lubens, verecunda,
Integra, cordata, and lachrymabilis, accelerata,
Fortis and accusans, and se punire parata.
Is an unclean Land] Because inhabited by an unclean people, who are acted and
agitated by an unclean spirit, and do miserably moil themselves in the
filthiness of lewdness, which defiles a man worse then any leprosy, then
any jakes, Mar. 7.23. Mr. Ascham, (Schoolmaster to Q. Elizabeth) did thank
God, that he was but nine days in Italy, wherein he saw, in that one City of
Venice more uncleanness and licentiousness, then in London he ever heard of
in nine years.

With the filthiness of the people of the Lands] Those Canaanites were very
Borborites, shameless sinners before the Lord; who therefore rooted them out,
and caused their Land, when it could bear them no longer, to spew them out. Sin
is filthiness in the abstract. (...).
St. James calls it, The stinking filth of a pestilent ulcer, and the
superfluity or garbage of naughtiness, Jam. 1.21. It is no better then the
Devils excrement: It sets his limbs in us, and draws his picture upon us: for
malice is the Devils eye, oppression is his hand, hypocrisy is his cloven foot,
etc. Great sins do greatly pollute.

Which have filled it from one end to another] Has over-spred it as a deluge,
overrun it as the Jerusalem-Artichoke does the ground wherein it is planted:
turned it into the same nature with it self, as copres which will turn milk
into ink: or leaven which turns a very Passover into pollution. See Mich.
1.5. with the Note.

Verse 12. Now therefore give not your daughters] unless ye have a mind to
pitch them into hell-mouth. See ver. 2. with the Note.

Nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever] For they were devoted by God to
utter destruction: and therefore Israel might have no intercourse with them.
The Jews at this day count and call us Canaanites, Edomites, etc. and hold it
an almesdeed to knock us on the head. The best among the Gentiles, say they is
worthy cui caput conteratur tanquam Serpenti to be killed up as a Serpent.
Tacitus long since observed of them, that as they were very kind to their own,
so to all others they bare a deadly hatred. Thrice a day in their prayers,
Buxtorf. Synag. Jud. cop. 5.
they curse us Christians; and in Polony (where they have a toleration) they
print base and blasphemous things against Christ and Religion.

That ye may be strong] viz. by my presence amongst you, and providence over
you: for cui adhaereo, prae est, as Q. Elizabeth could write: how much more may
God Almighty, He whom I favor is sure to prevail.

And cat the good of the Land] The best of the best, the finest Wheat, the
choyfest fruit, and those a pledge and fore-taft of the happiness of Heaven,
where there is nec fames, nec fastidium, (as one says) neither lack nor
loathing, neither measure, nor mixture, but sweetest varieties, felicities,
eternities.

And leave it for an inheritance] personal goodness is profitable to
posterity: the righteous shall leave inheritance to his childrens children.
Prove. 13.22.
God never casts out his good tenants; nor leaves his servants unprovided
for. See Psalm. 103.17. and 112.1, 2.

Verse 13. And after all that is come upon us] Affliction, like foul wheather,
comes before it is sent for: yet not, but of Gods sending: and then it is ever
either probational, as Jobs; or Cautional, as Paul's prick in the flesh; or
penal, for chastisement of some way of wickedness, as here.

For our evil deeds] These he thanketh, (as well he might) for all their
sufferings: sin is the mother of misery, and hales hell at the heels of it.

Seeing that thou our God] Our God still, and this is the sixth time that he
has so styled Him in this holy prayer, besides three times My God. These are
speeches of faith, and refer to the Covenant, that pabulum fidei food of faith.
When ye stand and pray, believe; when ye humble and tremble before God, keep up
your faith still. Nihil retinet qui fidem amisit, lose that and lose all.
Seneca.
Take away the iniquity of they servant, says David, 2 Samuel 24.10. It Is as if
he should say, I am thy servant, Lord, still, though an unworthy one. And to
prove himself so, he adds, For I have done very foolishly. I confess it
Lord, that thon may cover it. Homo agnoscit, Deus ignoscit. This he
believes, and speeds: when Judas confessing (but withal despairing) misseth of
mercy.

Have punished us less then our iniquities deserve] Heb. Have withheld beneath
our iniquities. The just hire of the least sin is death in the largest sense,
Romans 6.23. What then might God do to us for our many and mighty sins, or
rather, what might he not do, and that most justly? How great is his mercy
which makes him say, Jerusalem has received at Gods hand double for all her
sins, Isai. 40.1, 2. Too much, says God there: too little, says Ezra here:
and yet how sweetly and beautifully does this kind of contradiction become both!

And have given us such deliverance as this] A fruit of free mercy, and calls
hard for duty. Gods blessings are binders: and every new deliverance calls for
new obedience, Servaeti sumus ut serviamus.

Verse 14. Should we again break thy Commandements] There is so much
unthankfulness and disingenuity in such an entertainment of mercy, that holy
Ezra here thinks that Heaven and Earth would be ashamed of it. And join in
affinity with the people of these abominations] Especially when we may hear God
himself screeching out as it were those words of his, Oh do not this abominable
thing! Save your selves from this untoward generation, etc!

Would thou not be angry with us?] Id est, Chide us, smite us, and so set it
on, as no creature should be able to take it off? Sin may move God, when we ask
bread and fish to feed us, to answer us with a stone to bruise us, or a Serpent
to bite us. Shun it therefore as a Serpent in your way, or as poison in your
meats. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, etc. Psalm.
2.12.


So that there should be no remnant] So that our late preservation should prove
but a reservation to further mischief; as was Sodoms, Senacheribs, Pharaohs.

Verse 15. O Lord God of Israel] So called, because he is their portion, they
His, Deuteronomy. 32.9. He had avouched them for his: and they him interchangeably,
Deuteronomy. 26.17, 18. Seneca could say, that the basest people (meaning the Jews)
gave Laws unto all the World: that is, had the true God, Creator of all, for
their God.

Thou art righteous] In all thy judgments inflicted upon us: or, thou art
faithful and true in thy promises: but we have forfeited thy favor, and
deserved destruction.

Behold we are before thee in our trespasses] Or guiltinesses, which is that
iniquity of sin (as David calls it, Psalm. 32.5.) whereby the sinner is bound
over to condign punishment.

For we cannot stand before thee] But must needs causa cadere, being self
condemned; and such as must needs subscribe to thy perfect justice in our own
utter destruction.

CHAP. X. Verse 1. Now when Ezra had prayed.]
HAD presented himself as a Suppliant, and opened his cause to God the Judge,
appealing to him, that he might determine.

And when he had confessed] And begged pardon: deprecating the divine
displeasure, Hithpallel.
as the word signifies.

Weeping] Of this we read not in the former chapter, but of other effects of
his passion, as renting his garments, tearing off the hair of his head and
beard, etc. His sorrow at first might be above tears, which afterward came
gushing out amain, as the blood does out of a Wound, but not till it has first
run back to the heart, to bear the news to it, as I may so say. It is said of
Athanasius, that by his tears, as by the bleeding of a chaste vine, he cured the
Leprosy of that tainted age. May we not say the same of this good man?

And casting himself down before the house of God Where all might see him, that
their eyes might affect their hearts, and contribute some tears of compunction
and compassion toward the filling of Gods bottle, as they had done sins toward
the filling of his bag.

Of Men, Women, and Children] Anashim, Venashim, etc. A Woman is a man, cut
short by the head, 1 Cor. 11.3. Here was a general meeting of all Sexes and
Sizes joined together, to cut sins cart-ropes.

And the people wept very sore] They could not wash their hands in innocence,
they therefore washed them in tears: they knew, that as the sins of the old
World; so of this little World, needs a deluge. Their sins therefore are as
so many Hazaels to them their hearts as so many Hadad-rimmens, the place they
made to become a very Bechi^, they wept with a great weeping, and so vented
their sins at their eyes, as sick people do their ill humors at the pores of
their bodies.

Verse 2. And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel] Egregie cordatus homo, A prudent
and a pious man; one that had feeding lips, and a healing tongue, one that knew
how to time a word, Esaias (...) Prove. 25. ^.
and to set it upon the wheels.

Answered and said unto Ezra] Such words as were uttered more from the bowels,
then the brain: and thereby proved so effectual.

We have trespassed against our God] His father Jehiel had taken a strange
Wife, ver. 18. 26. so perhaps had he himself: or if not, yet he might fear
wrath, because of the same body politic with those sinners against their own
souls. God, he knew, might well draw blood of the arm for the cure of the head;
as Theodoret says he did when he slew Pharaohs firstborn.

Yet now there is hope in Israel, etc.] Hope that the people will repent, and
hope that God will have mercy, upon their repentance. Superest sperare salutem,
If it were not for hope, heart would break. God having opened a door of hope,
let us go holdly to the Throne of grace; what should hinder?

Qui nil sperare potest, desperet nihil. Cast not away your confidence which
has so great recompense of reward: but cast Anchor within the veil, and wait
for day, as Paul did in the Shipwreck, See Esaias 50.10.

Verse 3. Now therefore let us make a Covenant] And so tie our selves thereby,
to the better abearance: that we slip not collar, that we detrect not the yoke
of Gods obedience, Deuteronomy. 10.20 Cleaving to God with full purpose of heart will
require swearing. Broken bones must have strong bands to close them. Tottering
houses must be crampt with iron bars, or they will soon down. If the vows of
God be upon us, if we be Covenanters, it will help against the fickleness of
our false hearts: which cannot but know that if God shall be All-sufficient to
us, we must be Altogether his, Cant. 2.16. His is a Covenant of mercy, even the
sure mercies of David; ours is a Covenant of obedience to him, in every part
and point of duty.

To put away all the Wives] This Jews might do in this, and some other cases.
So did Romans also with this only bill of divorce, Res tuas tibi habeto, Take
what is thine own, and be packing. But Christians may not do thus, because of
difference in Religion: 1 Cor. 7. ver. 12. Whatever some late upstarts have
printed and practiced to the contrary.

And such as are born of them] The children of those strange Wives, persisting
in their paganism. These children though disinherited, yet were not to be
altogether deserted; but nourished, and nurtured also in the fear and
admonition of the Lord, Ephesians. 6.4. Proving if perad venture, God will give them
repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, etc. 2. Tim. 2.25.

According to the counsel of my Lord] Terms full of hearty respect, and humble
submission. He calls Ezra My lord, as Hannah did Eli, with an eye to his
dignity, and authority, both as a Priest, and as a Commissioner from the King
of Persia. At Venice every ordinary Mechanike is called Magnifico. At Vicenza
in Italy the common title to a common Gentleman is Signor Conte, as much as My
Lord Earl. But Ezra was every way honorable and deserving: titles of honor
were not worthy of him.

And of those that tremble at the Commandment of our God] A periphrasis of a
truly pious person, sc. such a one as fears God and keeps his
Commandments. And this is the Man alone that is fit to judge of cases of
conscience, and to comfort the feeble minded. Now although the comfort given by
Gods Ministers (such as Ezra was) be ordinarily most effectual (as is the
blessing of Parents, who are in Gods Room) yet others also (that are
conscientious and experienced persons, that tremble at the Commandment of God,
as here) may give excellent counsel and comfort in such a case. But how like
the motion of a Puppet, the language of a Parret is the best discourse (in this
subject of conscience) of the not-interessed man.

And let it be done according to the Law] Which, though it take no direct and
express order in this case, yet by due deduction and just inference it was
determined both here and in Nehemiah, chap. 9.2. that those strange Wives
should be put away.

Verse 4. Arise] Surge age Sum Pater, said Mantuan to the Pope, exciting him
to take Arms against the Turk: to the same sense Shechaniah here to Ezra: or
rather as Jehovah to Joshuah chap. 7.10. Get thee up: why lie thou here on
thy face?

For this matter belongs unto thee] Who have both an heart to do it, as
appears by thine humiliation, and also power in thine hand, as witnesses thy
commission.

We also will be with thee] Every man must show himself forward to further the
work of Reformation, moving regularly within his own sphere, and trading every
talent for that end and purpose.

Be of good courage and do it] These were verba non inflantia, sed
inflammantia. And thus may one by his hearty good counsel, become an Angel, nay
a God to another. Senarclaeus, in an Epistle to Bucer, telling how John Diazius
the Martyr discoursed unto him the Night before, he was butchered by the
appointment of his own Brother Alphonsus, has this notable expression; Ego
vero illius oratione sic incendebar, etc. I was so inflamed with his words, as
if I had heard the Holy Ghost himself speaking unto me.

Verse 5. Then arose Ezra] According to the counsel of Shecaniah, ver. 4. How
forcible are right words; Job 6.25. One seasonable speech falling upon a
prepared heart, has often a strong and sweet operation; as that similitude used
by Peter martyr, reading upon the first to the Corinthians had upon Galeacius
Caracciolus that Noble Italian convert: and as some speeches of Staupicius, had
upon Luther; who was likewise much confirmed and cheared up by conference with
an old Priest at Erford; who largely discoursed about justification by faith,
Life of Luther by Mr. Clark.
and explained the Articles of the Creed to him.

And made the chief Priests, the Levites, and all Israel to swear] (...). An
oath is a fence: and, added to a vow or covenant: it, does notably conduce (as
a holy exorcism) to conjure down our rebellious wills, and as cords or chains
to hamper our treacherous hearts, that they backslide not like back sliding
heifers; Moist bodies (as water) must be put into close Vessels: so must man's
heart be bound together by strongest helps, and resolutions. Neither cast we
any new snare hereby upon ourselves, (1 Cor. 7.35) but rather a new provocation
to the payment of an old debt we owe to God. Such was that of Jacob, Genesis
28.20. and 31.13. of David, Psalm. 119.106. Of the Nazarites, Number. 6.2, 3.
Rechabites, Jer. 35.6. This shows a very earnest desire to obey: it sharpneth
also our prayers, and dishearteneth the Devil: who seeing us thus peremptory
and resolute, will despair, and depart.

Then Ezra rose up from before the House of God] Where God had promised to hear
prayers for Christ's sake, whereof that house was a type. See ver. 1.

And went into the chamber of Johanan] As a fit meeting place, where they might
consider, consult and give counsel. Over the Counsel-chamber at Venice is
written, Let nothing be done here against the Weal-publike. A Professor of the
Turks Law proclaims before they advise or attempt ought, That nothing be done
against Religion. Over the Town hall in Zant are set these two Verses in
letters of gold.

Hic locus odit, amat, punit, conservat, honorat,
Nequitiam, pacem, crimina, jura, bonos.
Think the same we must needs of this holy Conclave or Council Chamger, where
the Sanhedrin was present, and Ezra President.

He did eat no bread, nor drink no water] Though fasting and faint with much
mourning; yet no food would down with him, till he had gone thorough-stitch
with the work. It was his meat and drink to do the will of his Heavenly Father.
So it was good Jobs, chap. 23.12. and our Saviors, Matthew. 21.17, 23. It was
then, when disappointed of a breakfast at the barren Fig Tree, and coming
hungry into the City, he went not into a Victualling-house, nor into a Friends
house to refresh himself: but into Gods House, where he continued teaching the
people all that day.

For he mourned because of the transgression] It was not then a natural
abstinence, arising from sickness; nor a civil for healths sake; or for some
other wordly respect: but a Religious fast, which is usually to be held out a
whole day, usque dum Stellae in Coelo appareant. (as an old Canon has it) till
the Stars appear, in the sky: yet so as that nature be chastised, not disabled
for duty.

Verse 7. And they made proclamation] Heb. They caused a voice to pass, viz.
by an Herald or Crier.

That they should gather themselves together] And so the guilty might be
brought to their answer, in that general assembly.

Verse 8. And that whosoever would not come, etc.] Laws, if they be not penal
and compulsory, will soon be slighted by lawless, awelesse persons. Howbeit,
Flies must not be killed upon men's brows with beetles? peccadillo's must not
be punished, as heinous crimes. Draco made it capital to be idle, to steal pot
herbs, etc. Of his Laws Aristotle says that they were not worthy
remembrance, but only for their overgreat severity, Ezra's Laws were more
mild.

All his substance shall be forfeited] This to men of their mettle, was a
forcible motive. When some have a loss in their riches, it is as it were raked
out of their bellies: a piece of their very heart goes with it, Job 20.15. and
they are filled with unmedicinable sorrows, Eccles. 5.

And himself separated from the Congregation] Banished the Land, or at least
cast out of the Church. Woe be to those that separate themselves, Jude 19.
Cainites you may call them, Genesis 4.16. Our Church-forsakers, Worship-scorners,
that last brood of Beelzebub.

Verse 9. Within three dayes] They durst not outstand their time, because their
estates were at stake. Why is there not the like care taken, and speed used to
make peace with God, since for ought we know it is now or never, to day or not at
all? Is it nothing to lose an immortal soul? why then cry we Cras Domine? why
stand we trifling and baffling from day to day, till it be all-too-late?
Remember the foolish Virgins, and be wiser.

It was the ninth Moneth] Which was the Month of May, says Diodate; counting
September for the first, after the manner of the Persians, Esth. 2.16. and this
great rain, being out of the accustomed season, was somewhat prodigious, and
seemed to portend Gods wrath, as 1 Samuel 12.17. Others make it to be in December
the deep of Winter: which though it be an ordinary time of rain (whence in
Greek also it has its name (...), and in Latin Hyems) yet these showers were
extraordinary, more like spouts then showers; and thence the peoples fear much
increased by their guilt: for as no body is without its shadow so is no sin
without its fear, quia nec sine conscientia sui, Tertul.
because it cannot shake off conscience.

Verse 10. We have trespassed] We have disloyally or rather sacrilegiously
trespassed, by transgressing the Covenant. Other men's sins are rebellions
against God, but the Saints sins are treacheries. Let the Philistines bind
Sampson, it will be nothing so grievous to him, as that his brethren should do
it. Men's offenses are much increased by their obligations.

To increase the trespass of Israel] To add to the heap which thereby is
grown as high as Heaven, chap. 9.6. and calls hard for fire from thence, Psalm.
11.6. to revenge the quarrel of the Covenant. Draw water therefore before the
Lord, as those did, 1 Samuel 7.6. Yea pour out your hearts before him. God is a
refuge for us, Psalm. 62.7.

Verse 11 Now therefore make confession] This is the souls vomit: which is the
hardest kind of Physic, Vomitus sordiu^ animae. Naz.
but healthsomest. This the Devil knows, viz. that there is no way to purge
the sick soul but upwards, by casting out the vicious humor wherewith it is
clogged: and therefore he holds the lips close, that the heart may not
disburden it self by so wholesome evacuation. Confession must follow upon
conviction, as here: and be followed by reformation.

And do his pleasure and separate, etc.] For they that confess and forsake not
their sins are only dog-sick. When they have disgorged their stomachs, and got
a little ease, they will be as bad as before. Wicked people make account of
confession; as drunkards do of vomiting: that they may add drunkenness to
thirst. But the man that shall have mercy must both confess and forsake, Prove.
28.13. Open a veyn, and let out his bad blood.

Verse 12. Then all the Congregation answered and said with a loud voyce] But
not with a true heart, Heb. 10.22. For within a few years they returned to
their vomit again.

As thou have said, so must we do] These were good words, and not unlike those
of Laelius in Lucan spoken to Caesar.

Jussa sequi tam velle mihi, quam posse, necesse est. But many of these fair
promisers turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their Fathers they were
turned aside like a deceitful bow, Psalm. 78.57. Look how a rotten bow, though
otherwise fair, when an Arrow is drawn to the head, and both eye and arrow is
leveld to the mark, yet it miscarryeth: So do the desires, purposes and
promises that unsound hearts conceive in their afflictions, and under just
convictions.

Verse 13. Neither is this work of one day or two] No more is repentance, that
first and continual work of every Christian. Nulli reinatus ^ isi poenitenti.
^. Tert. de po^n.
This made Tertullian say, that he was born for nothing else but for
repentance. Surely as in a Ship there is continual pumping; and as in a
Beggars coat continual piecing; so in the best soul there wants not matter of
daily repenting: this House must be every day swept; this Candle-stick every
day scoured. Besides, some sins are past in time, that are not past indeed, if
we dwell not in the undoing and reversing of them. The best of these hereafter
mentioned, were to begin a new their repentance, because they had not
considered their marrying of strange Wives.

For we are many that have transgressed] Heb. We have multiplied to
transgress. The comfort is, that God will in like sort multiply to pardon, if
we return unto him that is the expression, Esaias 55.7.

Verse 14. Let now our Rulers of all the Congregation] Our Sanedrim or seventy
Seniors, See Deuteronomy. 17.9. Let there be a matrimonial Consistory erected, and
matters in question orderly heard and determined.

Until the fierce wrath of God] We must not think that he will cease pursuing
us, till the Traitors head be thrown over the Wall, till there be a thorough
reformation. One Abimelech left alive, may be the death of Gideons 70 sons: so
may one sin favored, be thine utter undoing.

Verse 15. Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah] These two Priests
only, of all the company, had kept themselves unspotted, and so were fit to be
employed in the work in hand. Hier. Epist.
Diaconos paucitas honorabiles fecit, says Hierome, of his times. The paucity
of good Deacons has rendered them honorable. And I do not think, says
Chrysostom, that among the Clergy there are many that shall be saved. D. Hall.
Clerus Britannicus stupor mundi: and yet there never wanted amongst us those
dehonestamenta Cleri, that might give some occasion to black-mouthed Campian to
tell the World. Ministris eorum nihil vilius, Camp. Ra^
Many of their Ministers are most base.

Verse 16. And the children of the captivity did so] Appointed such a course
should be taken. And so it was a plain Plebiscitum, and accordingly executed.

Verse 17. By the first day of the first moneth] So that it was not the work of
one day or two, as ver. 13. but of full three months, and yet they were not
slothful in that business, but fervent in spirit serving the Lord. In the work
of repentance take time enough, dig deep enough by thorough humiliation; lest
the fall of the house be great. The English are not sick soon enough, says
One, and they are well too soon: This is true of their minds, as well as of
their bodies.

Verse 18. And among the sons of the Priests, etc.] What a shame was this, and
a stain to their cloth? These men's white ephods covered foul sins: whereas
they should have been careful to have kept all clean: as that Eleazer was of
whom it is storied, that he would not do any thing that might seem to be
sinful, because be would not spot his white head.

Of the sons of Joshua the son of Jozadak] This good High Priest had sons none
of the best. White Halcyons hatch black young ones. Caligula fuit optimi Viri
Germanici filius. Eli his sons were sons of Belial. Samuels were little better:
and yet it is not likely that he was faulty in that indulgence, for which his
own mouth had denounced Gods judgments against Eli. When Caesar Borgia Duke of
Valence invited his Nobility to a Feast, and after Dinner cut off their heads,
Pope Alexander (who was his Father) hearing of it smiled and said, his Son had
served them a Spanish trick. When Petro Alingi Farnesis had committed an
unspeakable Violence on the person of Cosmus Chaerius, Bishop of Fanum, and
then poisoned him, he received no other Chastisement of his Father Pope Paul
the third, then Haec vitia me non commonstratore didicit, he never learned
these faults of his Father. Good Joshua had better bred his children, then thus
to break out into an open violation of that Law, which they could not but know,
and should have observed. But God will show, that grace is by gift, not
inheritance: and men will show, that though nourture may somewhat amend nature,
yet it is grace alone that can keep us within the bounds of obedience.

Verse 19. And they gave their hands,] Id est, They plighted their troth, and
assured the assent of their hearts, 2 Kings 10.15.

That they would put away their Wives] Though as dear to them happily, as was
George Carpenters (Martyr) burnt at Munchen in Bavaria: My Wife and Children,
said he, are so dear unto me, that they cannot be bought from me for all the
riches and possessions of the Duke of Bavaria: but for the love of my Lord God
I will willingly forsake them. Act. and Mon. 806.
Let us do so by our dilecta delicta, our dearest, and most delicious sins.

They offered a Ram of the Flock] This shows that they sinned against
knowledge: for for a sin of ignorance the oblation was not a Ram, but a goat.

Verse 44. And some of them had Wives by whom they had Children] Who yet for
all that were put away, together with their children, ver. 3. The Hebrew has
it thus, And there were of them Women, and they had put forth sons, or exposed
their sons to do as they might, or to be disposed of by the Judges: as that
good Woman who told Bonner, Act. and Mon.
that if he burnt her, she hoped he would keep Faith, Hope, and Charity (those
were the names of her three daughters) No by my troth will not I, quoth the
Bishop: I Will meddle with none of them.

A COMMENTARY OR EXPOSITION Upon the BOOK of Nehemiah.
CHAP. I. Ver. 1. The words of Nehemiah.]
OR, The deeds, for he was good at both, and so a singular comfort to his
Countrymen, according to the notation of his Name Nehemiah, Id est, The
comfort or rest of the Lord. Here-hence also some infer, that Nehemiah
himself was the Penman of this Book (and not Ezra, as the vulgar Latin, So
did Alexan der Severus and M. Aurelius Emperors.
and many ancients would have it) like as Julius Caesar wrote his own acts; and
by a more modest Name, called his book Commentaries, and not Histories: yet did
it so well, ut praerepta non praebita facultas scriptoribus videatur, (said
Aulus Hirtius,) that Historians had their work done to their hands: He wrote
with the same spirit he fought, says Quintilian. Eodem a^imo dixit, quo
bellavit, lib. 10.


And it came to passe] This Book then is a continuation of the former: Nehemiah
being a third instrument of procuring this peoples good, after Zerubbabel, and
Ezra; and deservedly counted and called a Third Founder of that Commonwealth,
after Joshuah, and David.

In the month Chisleu] In the deep of Winter; then it was that Hanani and his
brethren undertook their journey into Persia, for the good of the Church.

In the twentieth year] Sc. of Artaxerxes Longimanus, thirteen years after
Ezra and his company first came to Jerusalem, Ezra 7.8. with Nehem. 2.1.

I was in Shushan the palace] Id est, In the palace of the City Susan: this
Susan signifies a Lily, and was so called, likely, for the beauty and
delectable site. Now it is called Vahdac of the poverty of the place. Here was
Nehemiah waiting upon his office, and promoting the good of his people. Nomine
tu, quiu sis nature a Gratius, ac te Gratius hoc Christi gratia praestet, Amen.
Strabo and others say, that the Inhabitants of Susia were quiet and perceable:
and were therefore the better beloved by the Kings of Persia, Cyrus being the
first that made his chief abode there, in Winter especially: and that this City
was long, and in Compass 15 miles about.

Verse 2. That Hanani] A gracious man, according to his Name; and zealous for
his Country; which indeed is a man's self; and therefore when our Savior used
that proverb Physician heal thy self, the sense is, heal thy Country, Luke
4.23.

Out of my brethren] Not by race, perhaps; but surely by grace, and place: a
Jew, and that inwardly, and therefore entrusted after this, by Nehemiah with a
great charge, Neh, 7. ver. 2.

Came, he, and certain men of Judah] Upon some great suit likely, for their
Country; because they took so long and troublesome a journey in the Winter,
not without that Roman resolution of Pompey in like case, Necesse est ut eam,
non ut vivam. Whatever their business was, these men had better success then
afterward, Philo the Jew and his Colleagues had in their Embassy to Cajus the
Emperor: who cast them out with contempt, and would not hear their apology
against Appion of Alexandria, their deadly Enemy.

And I asked them concerning the Jewes] The Church was his care: neither could
he enjoy ought so long as it went ill with Zion. He was even sick of the
affliction of Joseph; and glad he had got any of whom to enquire: he asked
them, not out of an itch after news; but of an earnest desire to know how it
fared with Gods poor people, that he might cum singulis pectus suum copulare,
as Cyprian speaks, rejoice with them that rejoiced, and weep with those that
wept, Romans 12.15. a sure sign of a sound member.

Which were left of the captivity] One of whom he well knew to be more worth
then a rabble of Rebels, a World of wicked persons: As the Jews use to say of
those seventy souls that went down with Jacob into Egypt, that they were better
worth, then all the seventy Nations of the World besides.

Verse 3. Are in great affliction and reproach] The Church is heir of the
Cross, says Luther: and it was ever the portion of Gods people to be
reproached, Ecclesia est hae. res crucis.
as David was by Doeg with devouring words, Psalm. 52. Their breath as fire
shall devour you, Esaias 33.10.

The Wall of Jerusalem also is broken down] So that thieves and murderers came
in, in the Night, says Comestor here, and slew many of them.

And the gates thereof are burnt with fire] They were burnt by the Chaldeans,
and never yet repaired. And to keep a continual great watch was too great a
charge and trouble.

Verse 4. And it came to pass when I heard] It was not without a special
providence that these good men thus met, and by mutual conference kindle one
another: and that thereby God provided a remedy. Things fall not out by
hap-hazard, but by Gods most wise dispose and appointment.

That I sat down and wept] He was even pressed down with the greatness of his
grief; Expletur lachrymis, egeriturque dolor, Ovid.
whereto he gave vent by his eyes, Zeph. 3.17, 18. God promises much mercy to
such to whom the reproach of the solemn assemblies was a burden. Nehemiah
cannot stand under it, but sits down and weeps.

And mourned certain dayes] Viz. For three months space: for so long he was
preparing himself to petition the King, chap. 2.

And fasted and prayed] This was a sure course, and never miscarried, as has
been noted, Ezra 9.

Before the God of heaven] With face turned toward his holy Temple, 1 Kings
8.44, 48. with heart lifted up to the highest heavens, those hills whence
should come his help.

Verse 5. I beseech thee O Lord] Annah Jehovah: An insinuating preface; whereby
he seeks first to get in with God speaking him fair; as does likewise David,
in a real and heavenly complement, Psalm. 116.16. Obsecro Jehova, I beseech O
Lord, (I am thy servant, I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid) break
thou my bands. So the Church, Esaias 64.9. Behold, see we beseech thee, we are
all thy people.

The great and terrible God] A great King above all gods. (...), Exodus 15.11.
says a Greek Father; glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing
wonders, says Moses in one place: as in another, The Lord our God is God of
gods, and Lord of lords; a great God, a mighty and a terrible. Vere verendus
and venerandus. Deuteronomy. 10.17.
Thus Nehemiah begins his prayer, and counts it a great mercy that he may creep
in at a corner, and present himself before this most Majestic Monarch of the
world, with greatest self-abasement.

That keeps covenant and mercy] That he may at once both tremble before him
and trust upon Him: he describes God by his Goodness, as well as by Greatness;
and so helps his own faith, by contemplating Gods faithfulness and
loving-kindnesse. God has hitherto kept Covenant with heaven and earth, with
nights and days, Jer. 33.20, 25. that one shall succeed the other: and shall he
break with his people? No verily. Be sure to keep faith in heart, or you will
pray but poorly. And for this, learn in the preface to your prayers to propound
God to your selves in such notions, and under such terms and titles as may
most conduce thereunto; pleading the Covenant.

That love him and observe his Commandments] That love to be his servants: Esaias
56.6. that wait for his Law, Isa. 42.4. that think upon his Commandments to do
them. Psalm. 103.18.

Verse 6. Let thine ears now be attentive, and thine eyes open] Should not God
see, as well as hear (says a Divine) his children should want many things? We
apprehend not all our wants: and so cannot pray for relief of all. He of his
own accord (without any Monitour) is wont to aid us. The eyes of the Lord are
upon the righteous: and his ears are open to their prayer. Psalm. 34.15.

That thou may hear the prayer of thy servant] If not secundum voluntatem,
yet ad utilitatem: but usually God answers his servants prayers; fitting his
mercy ad cardinem desiderii, Aug. Confess. l. 5. c. 8.
as here; and letting it be unto them, even as they will.

Which I pray before thee now day and night] Christ requires his servants and
suppliants to pray and not faint, Luke 18.1. Ordinarily, morning and evening
without fail; Extraordinarily, oftener. The Jews divide their day into Prayer,
Work, and Repast: neither will they omit prayer for their meat, or labor. The
Mahometans what occasion soever they have, either by profit or pleasure, to
divert them, will pray five times every day; and upon the Friday, (which is
their Sabbath) sixtimes. Vae torpori nostro! how few and feeble are our prayers
for our selves and for our brethren in distress; Grand Sig. Seraglio. 181.
who have for that cause an unanswerable action against us!

And confess the sins of the children of Israel] This He did more fully and
at large, then is here set down: and he fitly begins with Confession: that
having gotten off the guilt of sin, he might with more courage and comfort
deprecate wrath, and beg mercy.

Which we have sinned against thee] There lay the pinch of his grief, that they
sinned against so good a God.

Both I and my fathers house have sinned] Hic igitur Lyra deliravit, Lyra is
out when he says here, that Nehemiah confessed his own sins, but only as a
member of the same body, he himself being innocent. Comparatively innocent he
was doubtless; but that he was not without sin, and such sins as he had
cause to confess to be God-provoking sins, is clear by this very text. He
was sensible of his own sins, and of other-mens sins too. The sins of
our Ancestors not bewailed and disclaimed, are set upon our score, Dan. 5.22.

Verse 7. We have dealt very corruptly] Heb. Corrupting we have corrupted our
selves against thee. Or, We have bound over our selves unto thee to be punished
for our sins. Of confessing with utmost aggravation, and laying load upon our
selves, see the Notes on Ezra 9.

And we have not kept the Commandments, nor Statutes, nor Judgements] i. e.
Neither the Laws Moral, Ceremonial, nor Judicial. We have broken all thy
bonds, and cast thy cords from us.

Verse 8. Remember I beseech thee the word] It befalls not the Lord to forget
or remember (to speak properly) for all things are present with him.
Nevertheless Metaphorically God is said to do both; as when, being provoked by
the horrid sins of the Jews, he so punished them as if he had forgotten that
they were his people, or that he had ever made them any promises. And in this
case God gives his Prophets and praying people leave to be his Remembrancers,
Esaias 62.6, 7. Ye that are the Lords Remembrancers, keep not silence, and give
him no rest till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the
earth. This, Nehemiah does here most vigorously, and sped accordingly: Let us
do likewise. Cast the laboring Church into Gods everlasting arms, and inmind
him of his promises: burden him with them, Psalm. 119.49.
as that Martyr said; put them into suit, they are nigh the Lord day and night,
1 Kings 8.59. Say, remember thy word unto thy servant, whereupon thou have
caused me to trust. And in the want of other Rhetoric urge this with
repetition, Lord thou have promised, thou have promised, etc. He loves to be
urged with his word, to be sued upon his Bond, etc.

The word that thou commandedst, etc.] The threatening is also to be
acknowledged Gods word, as well as the promise; and the uprightness of our
hearts is, to be approving by (believing) the one, as well as the other. Sower
and sweet make the best sauce; promises and menaces mingled, serve to keep the
heart in the best temper, as Nehemiah's was.

Verse 9. But if ye return unto me] By sin men do wickedly depart from God:
as by Repentance, they return unto him, and close with him.

And keep my Commandments] Evangelically keep them: for with a legal obedience
none can: our short legs and pursie hearts cannot hold out here.

And do them] Or at least, be doing at them, do them as we can: si praecepta
faciamus, etiamsi non perficiamus, sufficit.

To the uttermost part of heaven] That is of the earth, which seems to our eye
terminated with the heaven, and covered as with an half-globe. Jews are a
dis-jected people to this present: and a fearful instance of Gods heavy
indignation against sin. Josephus says that in his time, they were grown so
wicked, that if the Romans had not destroyed and dispersed them; without doubt
either the earth would have swallowed them up, or fire from heaven have
consumed them.

Yet will I gather them from thence] Else not: Gods promises are with a
condition, which is as an Oar in a Boat, and stern of a ship; and turns the
promise another way.

Verse 10. Now these are thy servants and thy people] And therefore thou are
concerned, in point of honor, to see to them, and to work for them, as every
Master will do for his servants, and King for his subjects. Otherwise, the
neighbour-Nations our enemies may possibly say as Aigoland King of Saragossa in
Aragon did; of whom it is reported, that he long time made Charlemaine believe
that he would be baptized. (...).
And when he came for that purpose to the French Court, and saw many Lazars and
poor people expecting alms from the Emperors table, he asking what they were?
was answered, that they were the servants and people of God. On these words, he
speedily returned; desperately protesting that he would not serve that God,
which could keep his servants no better.

Whom thou have redeemed by thy great power] And will thou part with thy
purchase, or obscure the glory of thy conquest over the gods and people of
Egypt, by leaving the (...) people destitute?

Verse 11. O Lord I beseech thee] He ends as he began, see verse 5. praying in
the Holy Ghost, whose creature prayer is.

And to the prayer of thy servants] Whose necessities prick them on to prayer
in all places; and who pray for the peace of Jerusalem uncessantly, Psalm. 137.

Who desire to fear thy name] The whole life of a true Christian is nothing
else but sanctum desiderium, says Austine, an holy desire. Willing to live
honestly, Heb. 13.18. wishing well to an exact keeping of Gods Commandments,
Psalm. 119.4, 5. affecting that perfection, which yet we cannot effect.

Prosper I pray thee] Prosperity given in as an answer to prayer is very sweet:
as the cipher when it follows the figure, adds to the number: though it be
nothing in it self.

For I was the Kings Cup-bearer] And so might take mollissima fandi Tempora, my
fittest opportunity to bestead my people.

CHAP. II. Verse 1. And it came to pass in the month Nisan]
TIme and place is to be registered of special mercies received. This shall be
written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall
praise the Lord, Psalm. 102.18.

In the twentieth year of Artaxerxes] Surnamed Longhand; as our Edward, (...).
Omnium hominum pulcherrimus. Aemil. Prob.
the first was called Long-shanks, and another Longespes or Long-sword. This
Long-hand is renowned for the fairest among men in that age: and no wonder, if
he were (as is generally thought) the son of that fairest Esther.

That wine was before him] There was a feast, as verse 6. Not by chance, but by
Gods providence: who of small occasions works greatest matters many times; as
he put small thoughts into the heart of Ahashuerosh for great purposes, Esth.
6.1.

And I took up the wine, etc.] As Esther was come to the Kingdom, so Nehemiah
to this office, for such a time as this, Esther 4.14. Though he were a
prisoner, a stranger, one of another Religion, yet is he the Kings Cup Bearer
and taster: an office of great trust, and credit. This was a strange work of
God, to cause heathen Princes thus to favor the Religion that they knew not;
and to defend that people, which their subjects hated.

Now I had not been before-time sad in his presence] Princes are usually set
upon the merry pin; and all devises are used by Jesters and otherwise, to make
them merry: no mourner might be seen in Ahashuerosh his Court, Esth. 4.4. But
good Nehemiah had been, for certain months space, afflicting his soul, and
macerating his body, as in the former Chapter: Hence his present sadness,
which the King (being a wise man, and a loving master) soon observed.

Verse 2. Wherefore the King said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad?] Some
would have chid him, and bid him be packing, for they liked not his looks;
there might be treason hatching in his heart: he was a man of an ill aspect.
But love thinks no evil.

Seeing thou art not sick] Sickness will cause sadness in the best. Those
Stoics that said a wise man must be merry, though sick, when sickness came,
were convinced, se magnificentius locutos esse quam verius, Tull.
that they spoke rather bravely, then truly. And therefore Cicero to a merry
life requires three things. 1. To enjoy health. 2. To possess honor. 3. Not
to suffer necessity. Faith in Christ is more to the purpose, then any, or all
of these.

This is nothing else but sorrow of heart] The heart commonly sits in the
countenance; and there shows how it stands affected. Momus needs not carp
at man's make; and wish a window in his breast that his thoughts might be seen:
for a merry heart makes a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of heart, the
spirit is broken, Prove. 15.13. The Hebrews say, that a man's inside is turned
out and discovered, in oculis, in loculis, in poculis, in his eyes, purse, and
cup.

Then I was very sore afraid] Grieved before, now afraid. Thus, aliud ex alio
malum: fluctus fluctum trudit, One sorrow follows another, and a Christians
faith and patience is continually exercised. But in the multitude of Nehemiahs
perplexed thoughts within him, Gods comforts refreshed his soul, Psalm. 94.19.
he casts his suit or his burden upon the Lord, Psalm. 55.22. and doubts not,
but he will effect his desire.

Verse 3. And I said unto the King] After he had pulled up his best heart, and
recovered his spirits, he declares unto the King the cause of his sadness.
How ready should our tongues be to lay open our cares to the God of all
comfort, when we see Nehemiah so quick in the expressions of his sorrow to an
uncertain ear.

Let the King live for ever] i. e. Very long. Let him not suspect by my
sadness, that I have any evil intent or treasonable design against him: for I
heartily wish his welfare. It was not Court-holy-water (as they call it)
wherewith he here besprinkleth his Prince; it was not counterfeit courtesy;
such as was that of Squier the Traitor, Anno 1597. sent by Walpoole the
Jesuit, Speed.
to poison the pummel of Queen Elizabeth's saddle, when she was to ride abroad:
which also he did (but without effect) saying cheerfully at the same time, God
save the Queen. Saluta libenter is by many practiced, from the teeth outward;
but by Nehemiah, heartily.

Why should not my countenance be sad?] In time of common calamities there is
just cause of a general sadness, should we then make mirth? Ezekiel. 21.10? The
Romans severely punished one that showed himself out of a window with a
garland on his head in the time of the Punick war, when it went ill with the
Commonwealth. Justinus the good Emperor of Constantinople, Func. Chron.
took the downfall of the City of Antioch by an Earthquake, so much to heart,
that it caused him a grievous fit of sickness, Anno Dom. 527. When Pope
Clement and his Cardinals were imprisoned by the Duke of Burbons men in Saint
Angelo, Caesar in Spain forbad all enterludes to be played, etc. In France, the
Duke of Burbon was condemned of treason, his name and memorial were accursed,
his arms pulled down, his lands and goods confiscated, In England King Henry
was extremely displeased. Cardinal Wolsey wept tenderly, Speed. 1027.
and emptied the Land of twelvescore thousand pounds to relieve and ransom the
distressed Pope.

When the City, the place of my fathers sepulchers] A good argument to an
Heathen, who set great store by (as now the Papists keep great stir about)
their burial-places; as if one place were holier then another for that purpose;
a mere devise to pick poor men's purses.

And the gates thereof are consumed with fire] The Jews at this day, when they
build an house, they are, say the Rabbines, to leave one part of it unfinished,
and lying rude; in remembrance that Jerusalem and the Temple are, at present,
desolate. At least, they use to leave about a yard square of the house
unplaistered, on which they write in great letters that of the Psalmist, If I
forget Jerusalem, then let my right hand forget her cunning, Psalm. 137. Hist of
Rites of Jews by Leo Moden.
or else these words, Zecher Lechorban, The memory of the Desolation.

Verse 4. Then the King said unto me] Some think that Nehemiah looked thus sad
before the King on purpose, to make way to this his request.

For what do thou make request?] Not for any other honor or great office
about the Court, or in the Country: nor for any private friend, or the like,
but the good of the Church. Thus Nebridius in Hierome (though a Courtier and
Nephew to the Empress, Tom. 1. Ep. 6.
yet) never made suit but for the relief of the poor afflicted. Thus Terence,
that Noble General under Valens the Emperor, being bidden to ask what he
would, asked nothing but that the Church might be disempestered of Arians. And
when the Emperor, being himself an Arian, tore his Petition, he said he would
never ask any thing for himself, if he might not prevail for the Church.
Theodor. l. c. 32.


So I prayed to the God of heaven] Darting up an ejaculation, a sudden and
secret desire to God, to order and speed his Petition. Begin all with prayer;
and then expect a blessing. Call in the Divine help, if it be but by darting
out our desires to God. Crebras habere orationes, sed brevissimas and raptim
ejaculatas.
Thus Moses cried to God, yet said nothing, Exodus 14.15. Hannah was not heard,
and yet she prayed. Austin reports the custom of the Egyptian Churches, to
pray frequently and fervently, but briefly, and by way of ejaculation, ne
fervor languesceret, lest their heat should abate.

Verse 5. If it please the King] Silken words must be given to Kings, as the
mother of Darius said: neither must they be rudely and roughly dealt with, as
Joab dealt with David, (...).
2 Samuel 19.5. who therefore could never well brook him afterward, but set
another in his place.

And if thy servant have found favour] Pelican observes here, that Nehemiah
was a great favorite of this Kings: as appears in that having so many
Nobles, he chose him to this Office, rather then any of them. He therefore
pleads it as a pledge of further favor: so may we with God, as being no small
favorites in the beloved One, Ephesians 1.5.

That thou would send me unto Judah] Not only give me leave to go, but also
send me with a Commission to be Governor. This was a bold request, but
modestly proposed, and easily obtained. The King is not he that can deny you
any thing, Jer. 38.5. Love is liberal, charity is no churl.

Verse 6. And the King said unto me] He yields for the thing, only indents for
the time: as being loath to deny Nehemiah his suit, and yet as loath to forgo so
faithful a servant. Ipse aspectus viri boni delectat. Seneca.


The Queen also sitting by him] And assisting his cause likely. Some think
this was Esther the Queen Mother. But the Hebrew word here is, Wife: Now the
Kings of Persia were noted for uxorious.

For how long, etc.] The departure of a dear friend is so grievous, that Death
it self is called by that name.

So it pleased the King to send me] As a Governor, chap. 5.14. This was the
fruit of prayer, and therefore so much the sweeter.

And I set him a time] sc. Twelve years, chap. 5.14. But more probably a
shorter time at first.

Verse 7. Moreover I said unto the King] He takes further boldness upon the
former encouragement: so may we with Almighty God, the Sun of our
righteousness, the Sea of our salvation. Conclude as she did, A company comes.
God never left bating, till Abraham left begging.

Let letters be given me to the Governours] Those nearest neighbors, but
greatest enemies.

That they may conveigh me over] He committed himself to God, and yet petitions
the King for a Convoy. In all our enterprises God is so to be trusted, as if we
had used to means: and yet the means is so to be used, as if we had no God to
trust in.

Verse 8. Epit H^st. Gall c. 114.
Keeper of the Kings forrest] Heb. Paradise; probably so called, for the
pleasantness of it. The French Protestants called their Temple or Church at
Lions, Paradise David's delight, Psalm. 27. and 84.

Of the palace that appertained to the house] Id est, To the Temple, which is
called The house, by an excellency: as the Scriptures are called the Bible,
that is, the Book, as being the only best Book, in comparison whereof all
other books in the World are no better then wast paper.

And for the house that I shall enter into] Id est, A dwelling house for my
self, when once the public is served. Junius understands it of a Common-hal or
Shire-house, wherein he might sit and judge causes brought before him.

And the King granted me] It was but ask and have, and so it is betwixt God and
his people. When there was a speech among some holy men, what was the best
trade? One answered, Beggary: it is the hardest and richest trade. Common
beggary is indeed the poorest and easiest; but prayer, he meant. A courtier
gets more by one suit often, then a tradesman or merchant, happily with twenty
years labor: so does a faithful prayer, etc.

According to the good hand] He calls him, his God, as if he loved or cared
more for him then for the rest of the World. It is the property of true faith,
(...) to make all its own, that it can lay hold upon. See the Note on Ezra 7.6.

Verse. 9. Then I came to the Governours] Josephus says, that the next day he
took his journey and delivered his letters to Saddeus Governor of Syria,
Phoenicia and Samaria. A strange example, says one, to see a Courtier leave
that wealth, ease and authority that he was in, and go dwell so far from Court
in an old, Torn, and decayed City, among a rude poor people, where he should
not live quietly, but toil and drudge like a day-labourer, in dread and danger
of his life. But this is the case of earnest, and zealous men in Religion, etc.

Now the King had sent Captains] This was more then Nehemiah had desired: and
as much as he could have done for the greatest Lord in the Land. God is
likewise usually better to his people, than their prayers: and when they ask
but one talent, he ( Naaman-like) will force them to take two.

Verse 10. When Sanballet the Horonite] That is, the Moabite, Isa. 15.5. Jer.
48.3, 5.34. His name signifies, says one, a pure Enemy: he was come of that
spiteful people, who were anciently irked because of Israel, Number. 22.3, 4. or
did inwardly fret and vex at them, as Exodus 1.12. who yet were allied unto
them, and did them no hurt in their passage by them, yea had done them good by
the slaughter of the Amorites, their encroaching Neighbors.

And Tobiah the servant] A servant or bond-slave once he had been, though now a
Toparch, a Lieutenant to the King of Persia. Now such are most troublesome,
Prove. 30. ver. 22.

Asperius nihil est humili, cum surgit in altum
A'(...). Dio. lib. 60. Rer. Romans

Heard it] As they might soon do by means of their Wives, who were Jewesses.
And the Jews to this day are generally found the most nimble and Mercurial
wits in the World. Every Vizier and Basha of State among the Turks uses to
keep a Jew of his private counsel: whose malice, wit and experience of
Christendom, with their continual intelligence is thought to advise most of
that mischief, which the Turk puts in execution against us. Blounts Voy^ P. 114.


It grieved them exceedingly] Heb. It seemed to them an evil, a great evil: It
displeased them sore, and vexed them at the very heart, such was their spleen
and spite. Envy is a deadly mischief: and because it cannot feed upon other
men's hearts, it feeds upon its own; drinking up the most part of its own
venom. The envious man is not like the maid in Avicen, who feeding upon
poison, was her self healthy; yet infected others with her venomous breath: But
like the Serpent Porphyrius, which is full of poison; but, wanting teeth,
hurts none but himself: or as the hill Aetna, etc.

That there was come a man to seek the welfare, etc.] This they looked upon
with an evil eye, and were vexed. Invidia Siculi, etc. Who can stand before
envy, Prove, 27.4? It espieth with great grief the smallest things the good
mandoth or has? and is therefore absolutely the best thing to clear the
eyesight, said Actius Sincerus a Nobleman, to King Frederike.

Verse 11. So I came to Jerusalem] Thither God brought him as on Eagles wings;
maugre the malice of his Enemies. The Jews had great reason to rejoice, and to
welcome him with great solemnity; which yet they did not, for ought we read:
but that, hetaketh not for any discouragement; his reward was with God. He was
of another spirit then his Contrymen, who were all for their own ends, and
interests, and little cared for the public.

And was there three dayes] Resting his body ( Quod caret alterna requie, etc.
See the Note on Ezra 8.32.) But casting about in his mind how best to effect
that he came for, Ovid.
and to persuade with others to join with him. And now he found that he was
come from the Court to the Cart, from a pleasant life, to a careful and
cumbersome.

Verse 12. And I arose in the night] His cares would not suffer him to sleep
((...), etc.) but up he gets, and about the Walls: taking the Night, Homer.
as fittest for secrecy, and safety.

I and some few men with me] He went not alone, lest he should fall into some
danger of life, Vae soli: Not yet with many, lest he should make a disturbance,
and bewray his counsel. Be wise as Serpents. Matthew. 10.


Neither told I any man what God had put into my heart] That the thing was of
God, he nothing doubted: hence his fervor in following it: he knew there was a
curse to those that do the Lords work negligently. That he might not be
defeated of his purpose, he tells no man. He that would have his counsel kept,
let him keep it to himself. Hardly shall a man meet with such a Counsel-keeper
as he was, who being upbrayded with his stinking breath, answered, that he had
kept his friends secrets committed to him so long in his breast, that there
they rotted: and thence was the unsavourinesse of his breath.

Si sapis, arcano vina reconde cado.
Qui sapit, arcano gaudeat ipse sinu.
Neither was there any beast] For the avoiding of noise.

Verse 13. By the gate of the valley] By which men went into the Valley of
Jehoshaphat, Joel 3.2, 12. The Septuagint call it Portam Galilae; the gate of
dead men's sculles; because that way they went out to Golgotha.

Even before the Dragon-well] So called, either because some venomous Serpent
had been found there; or because the waters ran out of the mouth of a brazen
Serpent; or because they ran creepingly, softly, as the waters of Siloe, Isa.
8.6.

And to the Dung-port] Where was their common dunghill: a Voyder to the City:
near whereunto ran the Brook Cedron, or the Town-ditch.

And viewed the Walls of Jerusalem] Junius renders it, Vbi effringebam de
muris, Where I brake off a piece of the Wall: sc. that I might try the
soundness or unsoundnesse of that which remains of it, that I might know
whether it needed to be all pulled down, or whether it might be built upon. Our
Translatours read it, sober, not shober; and thence the different
interpretation.

Which were broken down] Asher hem perutsim: Hem with an open Mem which is not
usual; to set forth (as some think) the rupture and opennesse of the Walls,
(...) pro (...)
so much bewailed by this good man in this chapter.

Verse 14. Then I went to the Gate of the Fountain] Or Well-gate; where was
great plenty of Water-ponds, Watering-places, etc. Junius says it was that,
whereby men went out to the pool of Siloah, and Rogel.

And to the Kings-pool] The Watercourse made (or repaired at least) by King
Hezekiah, 2 King. 20.20.

But there was no place for the beast, etc.] There was so much rubbish, and
such ruins: This was the fruit of sin, which makes of a City an heap, (as the
Prophet speaks) and hurleth such confusion over the World, that had not Christ
(our true Nehemiah) undertaken the shattered condition thereof to uphold it, it
had surely fallen about Adams ears.

Verse 15. Then went I up in the night] Sc. by Moonlight; for the Moon is
Mistress of the Night, Psalm. 136.9. by the brightness she ^orroweth from the
body of the Sun, which the Moon receives and reflecteth, like a looking-glass.

And viewed the Wall] That which was left of it, (...) as Scaligers Epitaph is,
Scaligeri quod reliquum est, Scaligers relics.

And entered by the Gate of the Valley] Where he first went out: so he walked
the round, not earing to observe that Rule of Pythagoras, Eadem via qua
progress us fueris ne regrediare, Go not back the same way thou came forth.

Verse 16. And the Rulers knew not whither I went] Taciturnity, in some cases,
is a virtue: and every thing is beautiful in its season. There is a time to
keep silence, and a time to speak, Eccles. 3.7. And he is a truly wise man,
that can discern his season for both. Discamiu prius non loqui, says Hierome,
Let us first learn not to speak, that we may afterward open our mouths and
minds with discretion. Silence is by Solomon first set before speaking; and
first takes its time and turn, as it did here in Nehemiah the prudent. See the
Note on ver. 12. The word here rendered Rulers is rather Chaldee, then Hebrew.

Nor to the Nobles] Heb. White ones. Among the Jews great men affected to go
in white; as among the Romans in purple or scarlet. Hence Pilates Soldiers
clad Christ in purple: Herod's in white, Luke 23.11. Mat. 27.28.

Nor to the rest, etc.] So, as to ask their advise.

Verse 17. Then said I unto them] Then when I saw it a fit season to say it. It
is an excellent skill to time a word, Isa. 50.4. To circumstantiate it aright,
Prove. 25.11. That it may run as upon wheels: Nehemiah's words do so, notably.
Verba prius ad limam revocata, quam ad linguam, words well weighed ere uttered.
Nescit poenitenda loqui qui proferenda prius suo tradidit examini; He cannot
but speak wisely, who speaks warily.

Jerusalem lies wast] Id est, open to the spoyler: as the Pope made account
this Land was in Henry the eighth his time, when he had given it primo
ocoupaturo, to him that should first invade and seize it.

Come and let us build, etc.] With forces united, with one shoulder, Multorum
manibus grande levatur onus.

That we be no more a reproach] Quam multa quam paucis! How much in a little!
said Tully of Brutus his Laconical Epistle: and the like may we say of this
pithy and pathetike speech. Those that love to hear themselves talk, (says a
reverend Man upon this Text) and with many words to color their ill meaning,
may here learn how a simple ttuth plainly told in few words, B. Pilkington.
works more in good men's hearts, then a painted tale, that has little truth,
and less good meaning in it. An honest matter speaks for it self, and
needs no coloring: and he that uses most flattering and subtle words makes
wise men mistrust the matter to be ill. A few words well placed are much better
then a long unsavory tale. Thus he.

Verse 18. Then I told them of the hand of my God] Id est, of his gracious
providence in prospering me in all.

As also the Kings words] Which were likewise very gracious, and comfortable.
Now he that has both God and the King on his side, what would he have more?

And they said, Let us arise and build] So forcible are right words, delivered
in a mild and moderate manner, as here. Let us rise, say they. Let us linger no
longer, but speedily fall to labor: and recover that with our diligence, that
our Fathers lost by their disobedience.

So they strengthened their hand for this good work] They took courage, and
went an end with it. So much good may one man of place, power and zeal do for
the Church, by ^^irring up to love and good works. It is said of the precious
stone Pyrites, that it puts not sorth its fiery power, till well rubbed: and
then it is so hot, that it burns ones fingers.

Verse 19. But when Sanballat the Horonite, etc.] At first these men were sad:
but now mad with malice. Wicked men grow worse and worse, in pejus proficiunt,
but they shall proceed no further: for their madness shall appear to all men.

And Geshem the Arabian] Lieutenant of Arabia for the King of Persia He also
joins himself to the two former to hinder the work in hand. Such opposition met
Luther with, when he began to reform. The Pope excommunicated him: the Emperor
proscribed him: Henry King of England, and Lewis King of Hungary wrote against
him: but the work went on, nevertheless, because it was of God.

They laughed us to scorn and despised us] As a company of Fools, that could
never effect what we attempted. So Erasmus, and Sr. Tho. Moor thought to have
mocked the Lutherans out of their Religion. Notum est Erasmi dicterium, Qualem a
se decimu^ Capito fore sperat? etc. This the Scripture calls Cruel mocking;
and ranketh it with bloody persecution. Indeed the favourablest persecution
(says One.) of any good cause, H^b. 11 36.
is the lash of lewd tongues; whether by bitter taunts, or scurrilous
invectives: which it is as impossible to avoid, as necessary to contemn, etc.
Bravely contemn (says another Worthy) all contumelies and contempts for thy
conscience; taking them as crowns and confirmations of thy conformity to Christ

And said, what is this thing that ye do?] Scoffingly they said it: like as
Pilat said to our Savior, What Is truth? Oh how easy is it to wagge a wicked
tongue? Nibil tam volucre quam maledictum, nibil facilius emittitur. Cic.
One while they charge this people with folly; another while, with treachery.
If to accuse a man only were sufficient to make him guilty, none should be
innocent.

Will ye rebel against the King? This was ever; says Lipsius, Vnicum crimen
eorum, qui crimine vacabant, The only and ordinary charge laid upon the most
innocent. In Tacit.
Elias is a Troubler, Jeremy a Traitor, Paul a Pest, Luther a Trumpet of
rebellion, all the Orthodox, Antimagistratical. To color the massacre of
Paris, and to excuse it to the World, there was coin stamped in the forepart,
whereof (together with the Kings picture) was this inscription; Virtus in
Rebels Valor against the Rebels; and on the other side, Pietas excitavit
Justitiam, Piety has excited Justice.

Verse 20. Then answered I them, and said unto them] He would not honor them
so far, as to tell them of the Kings license; but shapes them a sharp answer,
Camd. Elis. Fol. 163.
and shakes them up as having nothing there to do. This was true Christian
courage; this was right, and much better then railing for railing: for that
were but lutum luto purgare, to wash off one dirt with another.

The God of heaven] Who does whatsoever he pleases in Heaven and earth: who
looks and laugheth at your malice.

He will prosper us] He will break his Heavens, and come down amongst us, and
give good success. O the force of an heroic faith! Though sense says, It
will not be, Reason, it cannot be; yet Faith gets above and says, It shall be:
God will prosper us. It eats its way thorough the Alps of whatsoever
difficulties.

But you have no portion] Nothing to do here, neither ought you to interpose in
aliena republica, as busy braggers and quarellers: meddle where you have
command.

Nor right] Sc. Of interest or any good desert.

Nor memoriall] Or enrollement there, as free denisons: therefore we neither
accept you as Friends, nor fear you as Enemies, etc.

CHAP. III. Verse 1. Then Eliashib the high Priest rose up.]
HE was first, as fit he should, for example sake; Ministers must be patterns
of piety: they have many eyes upon them, and every thing in their practice
should be worthy imitation. This Eliashib was grandchild to Joshuae, chap.
12.10.

With his brethren the Priests] Who were before fearful, or forgetful; Plut.
till inminded and excited by Nehemiahs who, as a Lion, became Captain to this
Host of Hearts, and atchievd great matters. So strong and so sweet an operation
has a seasonable exhortation, when it falls on a prepared heart, and it set
on by God.

And they built the Sheep-gate] And reason it was, says an interpreter, that
as they were Shepherds to the people, so they should build the Sheep-gate which
was at the Eastend of the City where the Temple was, where the Sheep came in,
that were offered in sacrifice, B. Pilkington
and whereof they had their parts, according to the Law. This Gate may well be
compared to Christ Jesus, who sought the lost Sheep, and was sacrificed as a
Lamb, and is the Gate whereby only we enter, and his Shepherds must be the
builders of it, and bring the people into the fold.

They sanctified it] Id est, beautified it, and then consecrated it by their
prayers and devotions. This was Priest-like; and probably, hereupon followed
that miracle of an Angels descending, at their several solemn feasts, into the
pool of Bethesda (which was near to this Gate, and where they washed their
sacrifices) and healing all diseases, John 5.4.

Even unto the Tower of Meah] Or the Centenary Tower, so called for its hundred
pinacles, happily: or, because an hundred cubits high.

Verse 2. And next unto him builded the men of Jericho] And are thereby here
eternallized for their forwardness.

Claros inter, habent nomina clara, viros. Though they dwelt farthest off, yet
they were of the first that came to work. Jericho was the first City that
Joshuah overthrew for their wickedness, and cursed him that should rebuild it.
Now it is the first that comes to help forward this City of God. So great is
the change, when God turns peoples hearts. Our Fathers were as barbarous and
brutish as the very Scythians: their Religion was a mere irreligion and worse,
till Christ came amongst us, Ennead. 7, l. 5.
and gave us the pre-eminence: For besides that England was the first of all
the Provinces that publicly received the Gospel (as says Sabellicus,) our
Constantine has been reckoned the first Christian Emperor, our Lucius the
first Christened King, and our Henry the eighth the first that brake the neck
of the Popes usurped authority. As we were the first that submitted to that man
of sin, so were we of the first that cast him off again; and although we are
penitus toto divisi orb Britanni, Lucan.
yet we have been hitherto famous all the World over for our faith and
forwardness in Gods service; though of late we have run retrograde, to the
reproach of our Nation. Diogenes in a great assembly going backward on purpose,
and seeing every one laughing him to scorn, asked them aloud, if they were not
ashamed so to do? since he went backwards but once, when they did so
continually. Oh let it not be said of us, as once of Jerusalem, that we are
slidden back by a perpetual backsliding, that we hold fast deceit, and refuse
to return, Jer. 8.5. This is to be worse, then wicked Jericho, etc.

Builded Zaccur] whose memory therefore is blessed, when the name of the wicked
shall rot, Prove. 10.7.

Verse 3. But the fish-gate] That stood toward the Sea, and let in fishermen,
as the men of Tire, chap. 13.16, 19.

Did the sons of Hassenaah build] Whethe^ this Hassenaah were a man, or a
City, it appears not.

Verse 4. Meshullam the son of Berechiah] This Meshullam was one of those men
of understanding made use of by Ezra, chap. 8.16.

Verse 5. The Tekoites repaired] The common sort of them: for the Nobles
refused. The lesser fishes bite best: the poor are gospellized, Mat. 11.5.
destined to the diadem, Jam. 2.5.

But their Nobles put not their necks] So haughty they were and high-minded,
they thought it a business below their greatness; Somewhat of that profane
Earl of Westmerlands mind, who said that he had no need to pray to God: for he
had tenants enough to pray for him. 1 Cor. 1.
Not many mighty, not many Noble, says the Apostle: Well if any. The Lion and
Eagle were not for Sacrifice; as the Lamb and Dove were. Yet the old Nobility
of Israel were forward with their staves of honor, and are therefore famous,
Numb. 21.18.

To the work of their Lord] Though they knew him to be Lord of Lords, who are
all his vassals and underlings; and by special relation, Their Lord, so
avouched by these his holy-day-servants; yet so stiff-necked were they, that
they would not stoop to his service; but cried out, as the Popish Clergy do,
Domine, nos sumus exempti, we may not work, we will not contribute.

Verse 6. Moreover the old gate] Famous only for its antiquity: like as many
old books are monumenta adorandae rubiginis, of more antiquity then authority:
and as that Image at Ephesus, (...).
that was said, but falsely, to have fallen down from Jupiter: so the covetous
Priests persuaded the credulous people, Acts 19.35. The Rabbines say, that this
was a gate ever since the time that David took Zion from the Jebusites, Quis
hoc credat, nisi sit pro test Vetustas?

Verse 7. Unto the throne of the Governour] i. e. Of the King of Persia's
Viceroy, who had there his Throne, or Tribunal. But to what an height of pride
were the Bishops grown, that sat in Thrones, and from on high despised their
fellow servants! this was their ruin, God puts down the mighty from their
Throne, and exalts them of low degree, Luke 1.52.

Verse 8. Of the goldsmiths -- the son of one of the Apothecaries] These were
ever thriving trades; They both had wealth, and hearts to part with it, upon so
good a work. Difficile est animos opibus non traders, etc. Martial.


Unto the broad wall] Which happily, for the thickness of it, was left
undemolished by the Caldeans.

Verse 9. Ruler of the half-part of Jerusalem] Which being part in Judah, and
part in Benjamin, had two General Rulers, see verse 12.

Verse 10. Even over against his house] Thither he was assigned, probably,
because there he would build the stronger, for his own security.

Verse 11. The son of Pahath-Moab] This man might be a Moabite by stock or
descent, and an Israelite by Religion: like as Jether was by nature an
Ismaelite, 1 Chronicles. 7.17. but by his faith an Israelite, 2 Samuel 17.25.

And the tower of the fornaces] That had fornaces or ovens under it: like as
the library at Bonony has a victualling-house, and a wine-cellar. In
commendation of which situation Cardinal Bobba conceited that he had very
wittily (indeed wickedly) applied that text, Prove. 9.1, 2. Wisdom has builded
her house, she has also mingled her wine, she has also furnished her table.

Verse 12. Shallum the son of Aalloesh] Some read it the son of an
Inchanter, or Conjurer: and tell us, that Conjuring was a common thing among
the Jews, as Acts 13. Elymas, and elsewhere the sons of Sceva, etc. But
Shallum (if ever any such) forsook that Science (as did afterward also
Cyprian) to become a Christian.

He and his daughters] Either finishing what their father (now dead had begun;
or parting with their portions toward the repair of the wall: and happily laying
their own hands to the Lords work.

Verse 13. The valley-gate] See chap. 2.13.

And the inhabitants of Zanoah] Together with Hanun their Governor. Not
Priests and Levites only, but the great men in every Country, yea and the
Countrey-people too, must work at Gods building. Every one must be active in
his own sphere; not live to himself, but help to bear the burdens of Church
and Commonwealth -- toti natum se credere mundo, as Cato did. Lucan.


Verse 14. But the dung-gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab] That is, of
the noble family of the Rechabites. A Ruler he was, and yet disdaineth not to
repair the dung-gate: All Gods work is honorable. Angels are Gods
executioners, as at Sodom. Magistrates and Ministers must do their utmost by
discipline and otherwise, to cause the false Prophets (that filth) and the
unclean spirit to pass out of the Land, as by a dung-gate, Zech. 13.2. Every
man must sweep his own door, that we may have a clean street.

Verse 15. He built it, and covered it] A Chaldee word. This people in their
captivity, though they had not lost the use of their native tongue, yet they
had got a tincture of the Chaldee; and of the Hebrew and Chaldee came the
Syriack, the mother tongue in Christ's time, as appears by Talitha kumi, and
other-like passages.

And unto the stairs] By these David descended into the lower City; and,
suitours ascended to his Palace. This is allegorically applied by some to
Christ (the true Jacobs ladder, John 1 ult.) who came down and humbled himself
to the utmost; that we by him might have access, with success, in all our
suits.

Verse 16. Over against the sepulchers of David] His burying-place: the Jews
had their sepulchers ready made, as the old Prophet, 1 Kings 13.30. Joseph of
Arimathaea, etc. So had the Emperors of Constantinople, their tombstone
presented them on their Coronation-day. Charles the fifth, Emperor of Germany,
five years before his death, caused his sepulcher to be made, with all things
appertaining to it necessary for his burial. Another great Prince began his
tomb, and left it unperfect; commanding a servant once every day to mind him of
finishing it. The Thebans had a Law, that no man should set up an house for
himself to dwell in; but he should first make his grave. David, it seems, had
his choice of sepulchers; not far from the wall of the City of David.

Unto the pool that was made] With great art and cost by King Hezekiah, 2 Kings
20.20.

And unto the house of the mighty] Where David's Mighties, or the Warders of his
City lodged, or where youth were trained up and taught to handle their arms.

Verse 17. After him repaired the Levites] Who therefore were not beggarly (as
many would make Ministers in our days, if they might have their will) but had
somewhat to spare for pious uses. For when they are said to repair, the meaning
is, they bore the charge of the work, and took care that it was done.

Verse 18. The Ruler of the half-part of Keilah] This was that City rescued by
David from the Philistines; and yet false to him, 1 Samuel 23.12.

Verse 19. Another piece] Or, a second measure; that is, he repaired two parts,
says Pelican: Lyra and others think it to be meant of the second ward and
wall which was called Secunda, where the Levites, Prophets and Students dwelt;
their College or School is called Mishne or a second part, Domus doctrina.
2 King. 22.14. which the Targum interprets, an House of learning.

Verse 20. Earnestly repaired the other piece] Or a second piece, as ver. 19.
He did two pieces, whiles others were about one. A ready heart makes riddance
of Gods work. He burst out in a heat (so the Heb.) being angry both at himself
and others, that had done no more: and in an holy fume, Se accendit.
finished quickly; kindling himself from other men's coldness, and quickening
himself from their slothfulness.

-- Sic Caesar in omnia praeceps
Nil actum credens, Lucan.
dum quid superesset agendum,
Fertur atrox --
Verse 21. Even to the end of the house of Eliashib] A small praise says One,
if the house were not of some greatness. Eliashib was high Priest, and dwelt
like himself, in a fair large house.

Verse 22. The men of the plains] Of the plains of Jordan says the Vulgar: but
better understand it of the plain Country round about Jerusalem, as chap.
12.28.

Verse 23. Over against their house] See the Note on ver. 10.

Verse 24. Unto the turning of the Wall] Namely, from the South Side to the
East: which turning came with the corner inwards into the City, D^odat.
according to the natural situation of the rock, and the valley.

Verse 25. Over against the turning] Of these turnings, there were many, as
appears above.

The Kings high house] In Spain, not only does the King dwell in a stately high
Palace, but also the highest room in every great house is his; and he must be
paid for it.

That was by the Court of the prison] Here Jeremy was prisoner, more then once,
Jer. 32.2. and 38.7, 13. And therefore other good people that came after him
thither, might be as well apaid as Dr. Taylour Martyr, who blessed God, that
ever he was fellow-prisoner to that earthly Angel (as he called him) John
Bradford: Or, as that other good Woman, who rejoiced that she might have her
foot in the hole of the Stocks, in which Mr. Philpot had been before her.

Verse 26. Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel] Of Nethinims, See Ezra 2, 43.
Their work was to carry Wood and Water to the Temple: Therefore, they dwelt
near the Watergate, for their own convenience.

Verse 27. After them the Tekoites] The people whereof had repaired before ver.
5. now also the Priests, but not the Nobles: they continued still stout and
stiff-necked, as ver. 5.

Verse 28. From above the Horse-gate] So called, say some, because there they
were wont to dismount, leaving their Horses. When the King himself came, he
must alight, and go afoot into the Temple. The great Turk at this day, when he
enters into his Moschee for devotion-sake, alighteth and lays aside all his
State, and goes in alone.

Verse 29. Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah] Egregie cordatus homo, Ezra 8.
ver. 16.

Verse 30. After him repaired Hananiah] Or, After me: Nehemiah, doubtless, did
his part, and a large one too, See chap. 16. and 4.16. but he omitteth, out of
his modesty to set down how much. In the Hebrew Text it is, After me: but in
the Margin, After him. The reason is given by some to be this; that Nehemiah
might most covertly set forth his own work, to avoid all show of vain glory.

And Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph] Not the eldest, but the best of all the
brethren. There must be no straining courtesy who shall begin: nor must men
fear for their forwardness to be styled Seraphical and singular. If Hanun were
alone, it was a shame for his brethren to suffer him to be so.

Verse 31 After him] Or, After me, See ver. 30.

Over against the Gate Miphkad] The Judicial-gate says, the Vulgar: the Gate,
of Commandment says Junius; probably where the Sanhedrin sat.

Verse 32. Unto the Sheep-gate] Here they began, and here they end, having
repaired round, and thereby obtained a good report; being here registered and
renowned. Those that have an hand in building the spiritual Jerusalem, shall be
surely crowned and chronicled. Their names shall be written in the Book of
Life, where no Devil can scrape them out. Up therefore and be doing worthily in
Ephrata, that ye may be famous in Bethlehem. Ruth 4.11.
To them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and
immortality, shall be eternal life, Romans 2.7.

CHAP. IV. Verse 1. But it came to pass.]
THE Devil and his Impes have ever been utter Enemies to Reformation. So do
savage beasts bristle up themselves, and make the most fierce assaults, when
they are in danger of losing the prey, which they had once seized on. Jabesh
Gilead would send in none to help the Lord against the mighty, Judge. 21.9. No
more would Meroz, chap. 5.23. Josiah met with much opposition: so did St. Paul
wherever he came, to set up Evangelical and spiritual worship; which is called
a Reformation, Heb. 9.10. All the World was against Athanasius in his
generation, and Luther in his: rejecting what they attempted, with scorn and
slander. Here it is quarrel enough to Nehemiah and his Jews, that they would
be no longer miserable. They were not more busy in building, then the Enemies
active in deriding, conspiring, practicing to hinder and overthrow them. A
double derision is here recorded: and both as full of mischief, as profane
wit, or rancoured malice could make them.

He was wroth] Heb. He was enkindled, and all on a light fire: he was as hot as
Nebuchadnezzars Oven, huge hot [he took great indignation] and was so
unreasonably enraged, as if he would have fallen forthwith into a phrensy or
apoplexy; as that Roman Emperor did, by raging at his servant. He was grieved
before, chap. 2. but now he was madded.

And mocked the Jews] By word and gesture, fleering and jeering, flouting and
scoffing at them, as the Pharisees also did at our Savior, Luke 16.14. David's
Enemies at him, upon their ale-bench: Sr. Tho. Moore and other learned Papists,
at the new-Gospellers. See chap. 2.19. This might have dismayed these poor
Jews, and put them out of countenance; for our nature is most impatient of
reproaches; there being none so mean, but thinks himself worthy of some regard:
and a reproachful scorn (such as these here) shows an utter disrespect, which
issues from the very superfluity of malice. If God had not strengthened them,
says One, it would have made them leave their work, and run away.

Verse 2. And he spoke before his brethren] Id est, before his companions and
accomplices who would second him and say the same, his Aiones, and Negones, as
one calls such.

And the Army of Samaria] The Garrison-souldiers; or those that lay there
billetted, to observe the people.

What do these feeble Jews?] These beggarly shiftlesse Fellows, these
Asinarii, (as Melon and Appion of Alexandria disgracefully called the Jews:)
like as Tertullian tells us, that the Pagans painted the God of the
Christians with an Asses head, and a Book in his hand: to note that they were
silly and despicable people. B. Jewel in a Sermon of his, cites this out of
Tertullian, and adds, Do not our adversaries the like at this day against all
that profess the Gospel?

Will they fortify themselves?] Heb. Will they leave to themselves, sc. any
thing to trust unto? Junius renders An sinerent eos? should they, ( sc. the
Officers and Soldiers) suffer them thus to do?

Will they sacrifice?] Sc. at the dedication of their new Walls? Will they do
this all at once? and think they without more ado, to have the liberty of
their Sanctuary.

Will they make an end in a day?] It should seem so by their Cito, Cito, quick
dispatch of their parts and task, etc.

Praecipita tempus: mors atra impendet agenti. Sil. Ital.
Will they revive the Stones, etc.] Stones they want for their new wall: where
will they have them? will they glue together the old Stones, and revive them
out of the rubbish? will they do this? or, what will they do?

Verse 3. Now Tobiah the Ammonite] This was one of Sanballats good brethren,
ver. 2. A Bird of the same feather, a loaf of the same leven, his
fellow-scoffer, and so homine pejor, says Chrysostom; worse then a man; as
the scoffed that bears it well, is Angelis par, says he, an Angels peer.

Even that which they build, if a Fox go up, etc.] It was some such bitter jeer
that Remus uttered in contempt of Romulus his new wall, and was knocked on the
head for it. Hae sannae leniter volant, non leniter violant.

Verse 4. Hear, o our God] These mocks and menaces lay so heavy upon Nehemiah's
spirit, that he could not ease himself, but by breathing heavenward; and
turning them over to God to take an order with them. His prayer is not long but
full: A child may not chat in his Fathers presence: his words must be humble,
earnest, direct to the point, avoiding vain babblings, and tedious prolixities.

For we are despised] Heb. We are contempt in the abstract. Not vilified we are
only, but nullified, as a company of (...) No-bodies. So Paul (the most
precious man upon earth) and his companions ( the glory of Christ, Esaias 62.3.
and a Royal diadem in the hand of Jehovah) were looked upon as the filth of
the World, and the offscouring of al things, 1 Cor. 4. What matter is it then
what becomes of us? 2 John
We have a God to turn us to, and Demetrius has testimony of the truth: that is
enough; let Diotrephes prate, what he pleases.

And turn their reproach upon their own heads] Surely God scorneth these
Scorners, says Solomon: that is, Prove. 3.34.
says Rabbi Levi upon that Taxt, he casts them into some calamity, and so
makes them a laughing stock, to those whom they have laughed at. God loves to
retaliate, to pay men home in their own coin. Thus he dealt by Appion of
Alexandria: who scoffing at Religion, Josephus.
(and especially at circumcision) had an ulcer the same time, and in the same
place. The like ill end befell Julian the Apostate, whose daily practice was to
scoff at Christ and his people. Dioclesian the Emperor (as Volaterran
writes) had a Jester called Genesius, who used to make him merry at meals,
and, amongst their devises, would scoff and squib at Christians: But God
plagued him for example of others. And the like he did to Morgan that mocking
Bishop of St. Davies: to John Apowel who derided William Mauldon for his
devotion: and lastly, Act. and Mon. fol. 1902. Ibid. 1906.
to one Lever of Brightwel in Barkshire, who said that he saw that ill-favored
knave Latimer when he was burned at Oxford: and that he had teeth like an
Horse. But the Lord suffered not this scorn and contempt of his servant to
pass unpunished. For that very day, and about the same hour, that Lever spoke
these words, his son wickedly hanged himself, says mine Author. Lege, cave.

And give them for a prey, etc.] A heavy curse, and, as not causeless (against
implacable Enemies to God and goodness) so nor fruitless. Woe be to such as
against whom the Saints moved with a zeal of God, shall imprecate vengeance.
God usually inflicteth what they denounce against his and their irreconcilable
adversaries. Fire proceeds out of their mouths, etc. Revel. 11.5.

And cover not their iniquity] O fearful imprecation! Surely if they only are
blessed whose sin is covered Psalm. 32.1. What shall become of those that are in
a contrary condition? If pardon of sin be such a voluminous mercy, as having
many other mercies bound up with it, think what a misery it is to have sin
imputed; and get a cover speedily, for that abominable filth, and, to God
himself an eyesore.

For they have provoked thee to anger, etc.] This was it that Nehemiah so
stomacked: and that drew from him these dreadful imprecations, viz. Gods glory,
and not any self concernment: He hated and cursed non virum, sed virium, etc.]

Verse 6. So built we the Wall] This followed upon his prayer, as a gracious
answer to it: the people were encouraged, and the Wall finished. Faithful
prayer is never ineffectual. Reproaching is an heartbreaking, Psalm. 69.20. but
so long as a Christian can pray, he is not without his cordial. I came for thy
prayer, Dan. 10.1.

And all the Wall was joined together] Not with gold indeed (as Cassiodorus
says, the Walls of Susa in Persia were) but with that which was better then
gold, faith in Gods goodness, and zeal of his glory.

Unto the half thereof] Unto half the height: for they could not do all at
once: neither can we in the spiritual building: but grow up and increase with
the increase of God. Col. 2.19.


For the people had a mind to work] And the more mind, because they met with
so much opposition. A free spirit is most seen (says one) when there be most
rubs in the way: when he that moves by outward poyses, will stick and be dull:
As when a bowl runs up an hill, every rub slugs it; but when down hill, a rub
quickens it.

Verse 7. And the Arabians and the Ammonites] A rabble of Malignants meet and
make head. Sanballat, by the help of Tobiah, had now gotten a great band of
soldiers, and specially of Arabians, Ammonites, and Ashdodites, to fight for
him against this feeble folk, but yet armed with God, and that had him for
their champion. So we may see how readily one wicked man will be drawn to help
another: and how the wickedness of one will infect another that will give ear
to it. Read Psalm 83.6, 7, 8. Rev. 16.16, 17, etc.

Heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up] Heb. That health (or as the
old Translation has it, a salve) ascended upon the walls. A Metaphor from
Surgeons, who when they heal wounds by salves or plasters join the flesh
together again, which before was cut in sunder: so the breaches of the walls,
which before lay gaping open, were joined together, and made sound, as though it
were one entire wall, and quasi tota moles in tantam magnitudinem ex unico
ingenti lapide tam magnifice consurgeret.

Then they were very wroth] That old enmity, Genesis 3.15. stirred in them, and
they were soon kindled; Satan being the boutefeau, or kindle-coale. See verse 1.

Verse 8. And they conspired all of them together] All of them, and together:
and yet this was not Unity, but Conspiracy: Such as is that among Devils, Mark
5.9. among Antichristians, Rev. 17.13. among Turks, who have as little
dissension in their Religion, as any. But well may that garment have no seame,
that has no shape. The army of Niniveh was quiet, Nah. 1.12. no falling out,
nor complaining in their hosts: hence their King marched on, passed thorough.
But so did not these conspiratours, because they met with those that were no
less well combined, and far better resolved then themselves. (...). Athen. l.
3.
The Thebanes had a band of men they called Sacra Cohors, consisting of such
only as were joined in the bonds of love, and resolved to live and die
together. These Jews under the command of Nehemiah were none other, and were
therefore insuperable.

To come and to fight] To turn their works into knocks.

And to hinder it] Heb. To make an error in it. The Hebrew word is used both
of the error of the heart; and of the foot, Esaias 63.17. Psalm. 119. ult. It may
be rendered here, to hinder him, to make an error in him: to make Nehemiah at
a stand, or rather to run away, to creep into corners, and give over the work.

Verse 9. Nevertheless we made our prayer unto God] Who is the Saints
sanctuary of safety, their present help in time of trouble. Prayer to him is an
anchor in all storms, and a salve for all sores; yea, it heals not only body
and soul, but even hard stony walls, verse 7. Provided that we judge our selves
in prayer, (...)
and commit our cause to God to be judged by him, as the Hebrew word here
imports. Eusebius: lib. 4. Ruffin. lib. 2. cap. 23.
Thus did the children of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, when to fight against the
Hagarens. Thus did Jabiz, and Jehosaphat, and Constantine, and Theodosius, and
that late victorious King of Sweden, of whom it is storied in his life, that he
would pray a shipboard, ashoare, in the field, in the midst of a battle; as
if prayer alone were the surest piece of his whole armor. Mr. Clark.


And set a watch] According to that of our Savior, Watch and pray, Luke 21.36.
and that of the Heathen, Admota manu invocanda est Minerva: Ora and labora,
pray, and then use best policy: first conquer heaven, and then presume of
earths conquest.

Against them] Or, over-anent them, at the workmens elbowes, and in the face of
the enemies.

Verse 10. And Judah said] Here was (...), impedimenti domestici: aliud ex alio
malum, a worse discouragement then the former. Judah (the chief laborers)
begins to murmur and mutiny, to faint and fall off. A perilous practice in
such a dangerous time, and enough to have undone all: as one coward in an army,
breaking the array and running away, may set the rest a running, and the day be
thereby lost. Lo, this was Judah, whose scutcheon was a Lion: but here unlike
himself.

The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed] Very specious reasons: they
allege: their shoulders aked, their strength was gone, there was no end of
their pains-taking, their work grew upon them, etc. The truth was, deerat
ignis, deerat animus, they were weary of well-doing, and not valiant for the
truth, Jer. 9.3. More like they were to those fugitives of Ephraim, Judge. 12.4.
then the Lions of the Tribe of Judah. Nehemiah therefore might well have said
to them as Alexander once did to a faint-hearted soldier of his, that was of
his own name, Either leave off the name of Alexander, or be valiant. So, either
hold out, and bear up under your burdens, or be Judah no more.

So that we are not able] Never was any thing too hard for Alexander; because
he never held any thing impossible to be effected.

Verse 11. And our adversaries said] But their plot was some way discovered,
and so prevented. Detexit facinus fatuus and non implevit, says Tacitus of one
in his time. So the Gun-powder-traytours betrayed themselves; and all came to
light, though they had dug as low as hell to hide their counsels from the
Lord.

They shall not know, neither see] But what shall he do who is Omniscient and
(...), All-eye? whose providence is like a well-drawn picture that vieweth all
that comes into a room.

Till we came into the midst among them] Either in the night undiscerned; or
by day, but unarmed, and not as enemies: for the Florentine Secretary, though
not yet (nor of many ages after) born into the world; yet the good of this
world was as great a Master then, as afterward.

And stay them, and cause the work to cease] The craft of the Churches
adversaries is never but accompanied with cruelty: and their cruelty is seldom
without craft. The Devil lends them his seven heads to plot, and his ten horns
to push: but in the thing wherein they deal proudly, God is above these
cruell-crafties.

Verse 12. And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them saw]
Their brethren from abroad gave the workmen intelligence; and this was a very
friendly office: for praemonitus praemunitus, premonition is the best means of
prevention. It is the property of a brother, though at other times not so
kind, yet in affliction and extremity, to find nature working in him, and to
do his best. See Prove. 17.17. with the Note.

They said unto us ten times] i. e. oftentimes; Genesis 3.41. Number. 14.22. The
Lord knows how to deliver his, as he did David from Saul, Peter from the
Jews, Acts 12. Paul from those Conspiratours, Acts 23. and this sinful nation
often from the blood-thirsty Papists. Masses were said in Rome for the good
success of the Catholic design (the Powder Plot:) but no prayers in England,
for our deliverance: and yet they were defeated ( Sorex suo periit indicio) and
we delivered. Admirable mercy.

From all places whence ye shall return, etc.] Some read it thus, And it came
to pass, when the Jews which dwelt beside them, came and told us of their
practices ten times out of all places, whence they came unto us, I set in the
low places etc. And here, I cannot tell, says one, whether these
Intelligencers be worthy more praise, or dispraise. It was their duty to have
come home, stood in storms, and help to build Jerusalem. But God which turns
our negligence and foolishness to the setting forth of his wisdom and
goodness, gave them a good will and boldness to further that building as they
might. Thus God uses the service of all men and creatures to the comfort of
his people.

Verse 13. Therefore I set in the lower places] I took them off their work, and
appointed them to stand upon their guard; appointing them their several
stations, and giving them orders.

I even set the people after their families] Or, according to their kindreds:
for he knew that Nature will move one kinsman to be truer to another in all
dangers, then a stranger: and that one kinsman will open his grief to his
friend, and take comfort at his hand, rather then to him whom he knows not.
Hence Nehemiah in policy sorted his soldiers after this sort.

With their swords, their spears, and their bowes] These were the ancient
weapons of war: neither had Death yet learned to cut his way thorough a wood of
men, but of the mouth of a murdering piece. Whether the Emperor Wenceslaus
did well or ill in executing Barthold Swarts for inventing Gunpowder Anno
Domini 1378. I determine not.

Verse 14. And I looked, and rose up) Et vidi, and surrexi, and dixi, so the
original runs. He saw the enemy a coming, he started up; and he made this
excellent exhortation: which puts me in mind of that which one once said of
Julius Caesar, Si acta ejus penitus ignorasses, per linguam tauen militem esse
diceres.
If you had never known him to have been a soldier; yet hear him but speak
only, and you will conclude him to be one.

And said unto the Nobles] In a short, but pithy Oration: such as was that of
Joab, 2 Samuel 10.12. (of which Pelican says, Non potuit vox duce dignior
cogitari, as brave a speech as a man could make) Or that of Hunniades about to
join battle with the Turks (see Turk. Hist. fol. 272.) Or lastly, that of the
Prince of Orange at the battle of Newport; where they had the Sea on one side,
and the Spaniards on the other. If, said he, you will live, you must either
eat up these Spaniards, or drink up this Sea. So here, Either you must fight
lustily, or all you have is forfeited assuredly.

Be not ye afraid of them] Away with that cowardly passion, which unmans a man,
and rectam tollit de cardine mentem, robs him of all power and policy.

Remember the Lord] Whom he that fears needs fear none else: The name of the
Lord is a strong tower, etc.

Who is great and terrible] For the defense of his people, and offense of his
enemies. The Lord is a man of war; Exodus 15.3. Yea, he alone is a whole army of
men, Van and Rear both, Esaias 52.12. And may better say to his soldiers then
Antigonus did to his, when they were afraid of the enemies numbers, How many do
ye reckon me for?

And fight for your brethren] Whether by Race, or Religion.

Your sons and your daughters] Those (...), as the Greeks call them,
Charissimi; as the Latins; dearest pledges.

Your wives and your houses] In the last Commandment houses are set first
before wives, because a house is to be first provided; neither will a wise man
take a wife before he has an house. Here wives are set before houses; because
far more precious, and a maine part of a man's self, Ephesians. 5.28. House and
riches are the inheritance of the fathers, but a prudent wife is of the Lord,
Prove. 19.14. She was on of the first real and royal gifts bestowed by God upon
Adam. By the way note, that if men may fight for their civil right to their
houses and lands, have they not as good warrant to fight for their Religion,
especially since they have the Laws of the Land for it; and besides, a civil
right at least to the outward peaceable profession and practice of it? The
Athenians themselves (though their Religion was no better then superstition,
Acts 17.22.) Yet they bound themselves by a public and solemn oath, to defend
it to the utmost. (...).
The words of the oath were these; I will fight for the Temples and holy rites,
both alone, and with others.

Verse 15. And it came to pass when the enemies heard] This rumor was enough
to affray these no less (now) timorous then (before) temerarious Samaritans:
Great bragges they made at first what they would do; but now that they see they
are defeated of their purpose, they are crest-fallen, and have no mind at all
to advance. So that to these may be fitly applied that which Gaicciardine says
of Charles the eighth King of France in his expedition against Naples, that he
came into the field like thunder and lightning, but went out like a snuff: more
then a man at first, and less then a woman at last.

And God had brought their counsel to nought] According to that of the
Psalmist, The Lord brings the counsel of the Heathen to naught: he makes the
devices of the people of none effect. The counsel of the Lord stands for
ever: the thoughts of his heart to all generations, Psalm. 33.10, 11. Here good
men may learn, says One, not to go nakedly, without weapons for their own
necessary defense: and much less, said I, without their spiritual weapons
(whether defensive, as the shield of faith, the breast plate of righteousness,
Ephesians. 6.
etc. or offensive, as the Sword of the spirit the Word, and the darts of
prayer) lest they be surprised and subjugated by that old manslayer.

That we returned all of us to the Wall] Not to the Tavern to toss pots (says
One) and boast of their great Victory: but in the fear of God they return to
the Walls, and every man falls to his work again. All Histories declare, that
the greatest Kingdoms, when they fell to idleness and luxury, then they lost
their former glory faster then they won it. The Turkish Empire is thought to be
on the declining hand, Turk. Hist.
because their late Emperors do far degenerate from their warlike
progenitors, their Soldiers generally give themselves to unwonted pleasures,
their ancient discipline of War is neglected, rebellions raised, etc.

Verse 16. And it came to pass from that time forth] As it is storied of that
peerlesse Q. Elizabeth, that in times of greatest Peace, she ever made
preparation for War: so did this incomparable Nehemiah; still fearing some new
practice, and not knowing what those restless heads were even now a hammering.

That the half of my servants wrought in the work] No servants they were for
Nehemiah, if they would not work. He was an active man himself, trading every
talent: and those about him must all be active. One would wonder how this
Courtier should become on the sudden so cunning a Soldier, and should marshal
his men so skilfully, setting the younger before to bear the brunt of the
battle, and the Elders behind to direct and encourage, according to that of the
Poet.

(...). But it was his God that instructed him to this discretion and taught
him, Esaias 28.26. and he might well break out and sing with David, Blessed be
the Lord my strength, which teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight,
Psalm. 144.1. Quando Christus Magister, quam cito dicitur quod docetur? says
Austin. Gods Scholars must needs be exact in a short space.

And the habergeons] These were armor for back and breast. In the Christian
Panoply there is no mention of armor for the back (though there is for the
breast;) because a Christian Soldier should never fly, Ephesians. 6.
but be like Androclid, whom when one derided, because, being lame, he went
into the war, he answered merrily, that he came thither to fight, not to run
away.

Verse 17. They which builded on the wall] The Master-Masons, and they that
bare burdens, Bajuli, Laborers and Porters, who bear upon their shoulders, as
much as they can stand under, yet go singing often under their burdens: the
reason whereof Alexander Aphrodisaeus says is this, that their minds being
delighted with the sweetness of the music, the body may be the less sensible
of the weight they carry. But these burden-bearers had little mind to sing,
their lives being in suspense. And yet, as worthy workmen, they went on with
the Wall.

Every one with one of his hands wrought, and in the other hand had a weapon]
Id est, When they were busiest in building, they had their weapons in a
readiness to resist. What a goodly sight was this? says one, to see every one
so full of courage, that they feared not the enemy; and so willing to work,
that they would not be weaty. Let Christian men look into this notable example,
and be ashamed of their slothfulness, etc.

Verse 18. For the builders every one had his sword girded by his side] Heb. On
his loins: that is the place for the sword to hang on, Psalm. 45.3. Gird thy
sword upon thy thigh O most mighty. And Rev. 19.16. Christ's Name is written
upon his vesture, that all may see it, and upon his thigh, where his sword
hangs, to show that he won it by his valor. Among the Turks at this day, S. H.
Blunt. 94. Ibid. 70.
as the right hand is held uppermost for a Scholar, so the left for a Soldier;
because it gives a man possession of his companions sword: though the Turks
seldom bear weapons but in travel; and then some of them seem no less like a
walking, then these builders did like a working Armourie.

Verse 19. And I said unto the Nobles, etc.] Nehemiah the more a man observes
him, the more he shall admire him. Surely he was (as Velleius says of Cato
Major) homo virtuti simillimus, a man as like virtue as might be: He was (as
Pliny says of the same Cato) optimus Orator, optimus Imperator, optimus
Senator, omniumque bonarum artium Magister, an excellent Orator, Vell. lib. 2.
an excellent General, an excellent Statesman, a Master of all good arts
whatsoever. He had cropped off the very tops of all virtues, as Pindarus says of
Hiero, (...).
and as Melancthon says of Frederick the Electour of Saxony. From the builders
here be turns him to the Nobles and Rulers etc. whom he would not have to be
Carpet-knights, fitter for a canopy then a Camp, for language then a lance,
etc. but active in their orb, and ready pressed to serve in watching, warding,
and preparing things necessary for the workmen.

The work is great and large] The compass of the Walls at this time is thought
by good writers to be certain miles about: and yet was enlarged as much
afterward by Herod.

And we are separated upon the Wall] According to our divisions, noted chap.
3.1. etc. and this is a weapon in the hand of our enemies: for dum pugnamus
singuli, vincamur universi, being dispersed, we are much disadvantaged.

Verse 20. In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the Trumpet] Which
therefore, for the purpose he kept at his own elbow, verse 18. as a matter of
trust, and importance. Moses committed the blowing of the Trumpets unto the
sons of Aaron only, Number. 10. for if the Trumpet give an uncertain sound, who
shall prepare himself to the battle? 1 Cor. 14.8.

Resort you thither unto us] As to your Rendevous, that we may stand against
the Enemy in an entire body; mean while Nehemiah walks the round, and
watches the Enemies motions, so that of him might be said, as once was of
Hannibal, Nullo labor aut corpus fatigari, aut animus vinci poterat, he was
indefatigable, insuperable: or as of Fabius Maximus. Live. decad. 3. lib. 1.


Hic patria est, murique urbis stant pectore in uno. Si^ ^tal.
Our God shall fight for us] Courage therefore, my hearts, He is the Lord;
Strong, and Mighty, the Lord Mighty in battle, Psalm. 24.8. and may far better
say then Henry the eighth did, Cui adhaereo, prae est, he whom I fight for, is
sure to prevail.

Verse 21. So we labored in the work] Their fear of the enemy did not weaken
them, but waken them rather to a redoubled diligence.

From the rising of the Sun till the Stars appeared] Time was precious: and
they redeemed and improved it. The common complaint is, We want time: but the
truth is, Non parum habemus temporis, sed multum perdimus. We do not so much
want, as waste it. The good man is perdius and pernox, night and day at his
business: and his thoughts are the same with those of Rabbi Simeon, Dies
brevis est, and opus multum, and operarii pigri, and paterfamilias urget, The
time is short, the task large, the workmen lither, the master of the house
urgent.

Verse 22. Likewise at the same time I said unto the people] He had a saying to
every one: and having ordered the work of the day, he appoints a watch for
the night season also: for they had many false friends within themselves too.
Caesar's vigilance did ever equal his valor: so did Nehemiahs.

Verse 23. So neither I] He said not to his men, Ite, but eamus, as Caesar did;
Go ye, but go we, and as Abimelech, Judge. 9.48. What ye see me do, make haste
and do accordingly: Velleius flattered when he said, Tiberius imperio maximus,
exemplo major. Nehemiah was so in very deed.

Saving that every one put them off for washing] To keep themselves cleanly,
and from being nasty: or otherwise, to wash themselves from legal pollutions.

CHAP. V. Verse 1. And there was a great cry]
SUch as seditious ones use to set up in their outrageous uproares: or such as
is the expression of great grief and anguish of heart. Significat clamor^m vel
querulum, vel imperiosum, iracundumm, inacem.


Of the people] The ignobile vulgus, a most dangerous and heady water, when
once it is out.

And of their wives] Who being pincht with penury made piteous outcries.
Invalidum omne, natura querulum. Seneca: James 2.6.


Against their brethren the Jewes] The richer sort, who oppressed them and drew
them before the judgment seats, as Saint James has it of the Jews of his
time: for they were no changelings. Let the Philistines bind Sampson, and he can
bear it: but do not you lay hands on me, says he to his Contrymen. Scipio
had rather Annibal should eat his heart with salt, then Laelius; give him a
cross word. Had it been mine enemy, says David, I could have digested it. So
could these poor creatures far better have born the insolences of strangers,
then the oppressions of fellow-brethren. Tacitus tells us, Misericordia in
promptu apud suos, etc.
that in his time the Jews were very merciful to those of their own Nation, and
cruel to all others. But here their own complain, and this was doubtless a
great grief to good Nehemiah.

Verse 2. We, our sons, and our daughters are many] That Is mercy, Epist: 7.
had we but keeping for them. Their wives were very fruitful, sed luctuosa
foecunditate (as Hierome says of Laeta:) for they had more mouths then meat
for them. The young children asked for bread, and no man brake it unto them,
Lam. 4.4.

Therefore we take up corn for them] Corn upon use, to keep us from starving:
and that by pawning or selling our dear children to the rich Creditours for
servants; till we can redeem them, which we are never like to do, ver. 5.

That we may eat and live] Merely to keep us alive: for else we would never
have made our poor children bondslaves. But Necessitas durum telum, Hunger is
so pinching a pain, that a Woman will eat her own child, as in the siege of
Jerusalem, Samaria, Saguntum: yea a man his own flesh, rather then dye with
hunger. Hitherto the poorest sort. Follows now another cry.

Verse 3. We have morgaged our Lands, Vineyards, etc.] Lands they had, but were
little the better for them. Husbandry they had neglected to give attendance
upon buildings: neither were they able to stock and store their grounds, and so
are forced to part with them at an under-rate. This is many a poor man's case
amongst us, who yet are little pitied, or relieved, Jam. 2.15, 16
unless it be with a little mouth-mercy, as in S. James his days, chap. 2.15,
16. Oppressors will be but as Friends at a sneeze: the most you can get of
them is, God bless you: like they are (many of them) to Darius; who prayed God
to help Daniel, but sent him to the Lions den.

Verse 4. There were also that said] Here was a third complaint to good
Nehemiah; to whom whosoever lamented were sure to have redress and remedy. He
did not serve these poor people, as that merciless Bishop of Mentz in Germany
did; who, to rid his hands of them in a time of famine, in horreo conclusos
jussit concremari, shut them up altogether in a barn, Hatto Archiep. Mogunt.
Anno 923.
and there burnt them: He was afterward eaten to death by Rats, non sine
maxima divinae vindictae suspicione, says mine Author, by a just hand of God
upon him for his cruelty to those poor, whom he would not relieve with his
corn, but let the Rats eat it; and of whom he said when they were burning in
his barn, that they cried like a company of Rats.

We have borrowed money for the Kings tribute] They did not deny payment, and
rise up in arms, Speed. 1012.
making Poverty their Captain, as the Suffolk-men did here in Henry the eighths
time: Neither did they answer the King of Persia's officers, as the men of
Andros once did Themistocles. He, being sent by the Athenians to them for
tribute, told them that he came unto them on that errand, accompanied with two
goddesses, Eloquence to persuade, Plutarch.
and Violence to enforce them. Their answer was, that they also had on their
side two goddesses as strong; Necessity (for they had it not) and
Impossibility, for they knew not how to raise it. These men pawn their lands to
pay tribute: but it went to their hearts, and caused this complaint.

Verse 5. Yet our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren] i. e. Nevertheless we
are men as well as they, though poor men, and therefore slighted (but why
should they hide their eyes from their own flesh, Isa. 58.7? Have we not all
one father, Mal. 2.10?) Yea, we are men of Israel, such as fear God, Acts
13.16. Hewn out of the same rock, dug out of the same pit, Isa. 51.1. cut
out of the same cloth, the shieres only going between. What if God have given
them more wealth (as the Shepherd bestows a bell upon his Belweather) should
they therefore insult and domineere over us, as if not worthy to breath in the
same air?

Our children as their children] Viz. As dear to us, and as freeborn every
way as theirs are; Prove. 15.31.
why then should their unmerciful dealing enslave them? He that oppresses the
poor, reproacheth his Maker: but he that honors him, has mercy on the
poor. There is a Writ in England which bears this name, Ne injuste vexes,
Vex not any man unjustly: But Law without execution, is like a bell without a
clapper. It was done directly against Law, that is here complained of. See
Levit. 25:39. and therefore there is an Ecce set upon it in the next words: And
(lo) we bring into bondage, etc. These cruel Cormorants thought to bear out
and justify the most monstrous misdemeanour, because it was the fact of a
Grandee, who could as easily break thorough the lattice of the Laws, as the
bigger flies do thorough a spider-web; as Anacharsis once said concerning his
Scythians.

We bring into bondage our sons and our daughters] This went to the hearts of
them; and well it might. For, 1. Our children are a chief part of our selves,
even the seed; as though now there were nothing left in us but the chasse. 2.
Bondage is very grievous, as liberty exceeding sweet. Did we but live a while
in Turkey, (says one) in Persia, yea or but in France, a dram of that liberty
we yet enjoy, would be as precious to us, as a drop of cold water would have
been to the rich man in hell, when he lay broyling in those flames. 3. They
were necessitated to do this with their own hands, we bring into bondage, etc.
hard hunger driving us thereunto, though as ill-willing thereunto as ever Jacob
was to part with his Benjamin into Egypt: he would not do it till there was no
remedy. 4. They sold them for slaves, not to strangers, but to their own
friends and Countrymen, where we looked for more courtesy. But a man had as
good deal with a Cossack or Cannibal, as with a truly covetous caytiff, and as
much favor and fair-dealing he shall find. For such an one respects neither
friend nor foe; nor regards at all how he comes by it, by hook or by crook, by
right or by wrong, be it short or long.

And some of our daughters are brought into bondage already] So that our
complaints are neither false nor causeless: for that weaker sex is every way
subject to more abuse, their chastity (which is their honor) was much
hazarded. Castus quasi (...) natus.


Neither is it in our power to redeem them] Would we never so feign. What
would not a tenderhearted father give or do for the redemption of his dear
child? To let go many other examples, Fridericus Barbarossa, Emperor of
Germany, (when as in the wars betwixt the Pope and him, his youngest son was
taken prisoner by the Venetian fleet) Vehementi amore commotus erga silium
captum, says mine Author, through an earnest desire of getting his sons
liberty, he concluded a peace upon most unequal terms, Val. Max. Christ. page
193 and 309
viz. that he should come in person to Venice, and there prostrate at the Popes
feet (who trod upon the Emperors neck) he should beg pardon; and then having
settled peace in Italy, led his army into Asia against the Turk. All this he did
for his sons liberty.

For other men have our lands and vineyards] Even those men that so lately came
out of captivity themselves, and know the misery of want and slavery. Those
that partake now of so much liberty, and liberality from the Kings of Persia,
and yet behold they pull up the bridge before us that themselves have gone
over. Surely there is no truth nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land,
Hos. 4.1. Lo this was Vox oppressorum mercesque retenta laborum.

Verse 6. And I was very angry] Red-hot with anger, and not without cause. To
be angry without cause, is to be guilty of judgment, Matthew. 5. but in case of
Gods dishonor, and public prejudice, moderation is mopishnesse, toleration,
cowardice, etc. Nehemiah was a Magistrate, that is, a Mortal God: as God is an
Immortal Magistrate. Therefore as God is angry at the oppressions of poor
people ( Lactantius has written a book De ira Dei) so should his Lieutenants:
And this holy anger should be cos fortitudinis, a means to encourage, or rather
to enrage them against Oppressors, who grind the faces of the poor, and take
from them burdens of Wheat, Amos 5.11. Yea, lands and vineyards, as here,
eating bread baked with the tears of men, coining their money on their skins,
and wringing their spunges into their own purses.

When I heard their cry] His anger then was mixed with grief, as was our
Saviors, Mar. 3.5. it was pure zeal, which is nothing else but an extreme (but
regular) heat of all the affections.

Verse 7. Then I consulted with my self] As reason required: he was very angry,
but yet he keeps within compass, and practices that rule, Be angry, and sin
not: which, (says one) is the easiest charge under the hardest condition that
can be. He that will be angry, and not sin, let him be angry at nothing but
at sin: and then see to it also that it become not a sin, by anteverting
right reason. Nehemiah was not so angry but that he could consult with himself,
and deliberate what was best to be done: his heart consulted within him, or
wisely overruled him: so the Hebrew.

Then I rebuked the Nobles and the Elders] Not in his passion, but upon serious
deliberation; and having put himself into a fit frame, that he might neither
over nor under-do. Valete, quoniam vobis irascor, said Archytas to his servants
that had offended him; I have nothing to say to you, till mine anger be over.
Plutarch.


And said unto them, you exact usury, etc.] This reproof was, as it should be,
warm but not scalding: Words of reviling and disgrace do scald as it were. But
words that tend to stir up the conscience to a due consideration of the fault,
these are duly warm, and tend to make the Physic work more kindly.

Every one of his brother] This was a presumptuous violation of the Law, Exodus
22.25. Levit. 25.36, 37. and a sin that they had soundly smarted for, Ezekiel.
22.12. Usurers are men-eaters, Psalm. 14.4. like Pickrels in a pond, or Sharkes
in the Sea, that devour the lesser fishes. Anno 1235. There were spread
thorough England certain Roman Usurers, called Caursini (quasi capientes ursi,
devouring bears, quoth Matthew. Paris) who had entangled the King, Nobles, and
all others that had to deal in the Court of Rome, Speed 613.
in their cunning snares, under color of supplying with money, such as wanted
present pay to the Pope: so these, to the King of Persia.

And I set a great assembly against them] i. e. I reproved them, first,
privately, and then publicly, and he does it severe and ad vivum, roughly and
roundly, not going about the bush with them, though they were Nobles and
Rulers. Reprehensiones personatae frigent; 1 Kings 22.8.
such as was that of Jehoshaphat to Ahab, Let not the King say so. This is to
do more harm then good.

Verse 8. And I said unto them, We after our ability] This he speaks not in a
vainglorious vaunting way, or to curry favor with the people, but to convince
the contraryminded of their inhumanity to their poor brethren. Good works,
says Chrysostom, are unanswerable syllogismes; invincible demonstrations to
confute, and convert those that do otherwise. Let your works so shine before
men, etc.

Which were sold unto the heathen] This they did in obedience to the Law, Deuteronomy.
25.47, 48.

And will you even sell your brethren?] There was no resisting of such a
rational reproof, no whit imbittered (as the manner is) with wrath or spite;
but carried on with so much modesty and moderation.

Or shall they be sold unto us?] He makes himself a party, because of the same
body politic.

Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer] Such is the majesty
of a reproof rightly administered: it even gags the offendour, as Matthew. 22.12.
and renders him self-condemned, Tit. 3.11. Scipio with his countenance only,
quelled and quieted his seditious soldiers. Alexander the Great, and after him
Augustus Caesar, and Severus the Emperor did the same, with a few quick words.
Adrianus Boxschafius, Preacher of the Word at Antwerp, hearing a certain Monk
railing at Luther out of the Pulpit, Scu'tet. Annal.
Tell me, said he, thou perverse Monk, and that openly before all this people,
where, and when, and in what points Luther has erred? The Monk thus accoasted,
answered not a word, but gat him out of the Pulpit, and fled away as fast as he
could, and never came again into that Country.

Verse 9. Also I said, It is not good that you do] No oratory is so powerful,
as that of mildness. The drops that fall easily upon the corn, ripen and fill
the ear; when hasty showers lay all flat to the earth, without hope of
recovery. Gregory has observed, that they that could not be cured with strong
potions, have been recovered with warm water. Reprovers of others must deal
warily; as bone-setters: and as we take a mote out of ones eye.

Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God?] Which would have reynd you in,
and restrained you from such exorbitancies, Genesis 42.18. You need not fear me,
said Joseph to his brethren, for I fear God, and therefore dare do you no hurt.
Ye shall not oppress one another; but thou shall fear thy God: for I am the
Lord your God, Levit. 25.17. Jer. 5.22. Psalm. 114.7.
And will ye not tremble at my presence, says the Lord? Tremble thou earth at
the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob. Oppressors are
called Canaanites, Hos. 12.7. He is Canaan (that is a mere natural man, utterly
void of Gods holy fear, Ezekiel. 16.3.) the balances of deceit are in his hand;
he loves to oppress. To him that is afflicted, pity should be showed from his
friend (as it should have been to these poor Jews from their hard-hearted
Countrymen and kinsmen) but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty, and is
therefore merciless.

Because of the reproach of the Heathen our enemies] Who watch for our halting
more earnestly then a dog does for a bone, and will be glad of any occasion to
speak evil of us and of our Religion; with, These are your Professors, etc.
You see what Tyrants and Tigers they are one to another. Hereby the banks of
blasphemy will be broken down in them, to speak evil with open mouth of the
Name of God; And will ye trample upon that dear and dread Name?

Verse 10. I likewise, and my brethren -- might exact money] To wit, for money
we have lent them; Seneca.
or as a recompense of our public employments. But posse and nolle, nobile est.

I pray you leave off this usury] Who can resist this sweet and sovereign
admonition? See verse 9. They had somewhat to say, no doubt, in defense of
their usury; as also many have at this day. But let them consider, that usury
is here and elsewhere cried down without distinction, Psalm. 15.5. Ezekiel. 18.8,
13. That the lender deals not as he would be dealt withal: that Saint Luke
makes him worse then other sinners, when he says, Sinners lend to sinners to
receive the like, but these to receive more, Luke 6.34. That Heathens condemned
usury, as Aristotle in his Ethics, and Agis the General of the Athenians,
Agesilaus King of Spartans: who when he saw the Usurers bills and bonds set on
fire by Agis, said, That he never saw a clearer fire burn. And lastly, Plut.
in Solone.
that at Rome it self Usurers are excommunicated monthly.

Verse 11. Restore, I pray you to them even this day] While you are in a
melting temper, and in a good mind, make restitution. Say not, This is an hard
saying, who can brook it? But say rather, as the Civilian says, Perquam durum
est; sed ita lex scripta est, Ulpian.
It Is hard to be done, but the Law will have it so done: Aut faciendum, aut
patiendum: Either we must do it, or do worse. The Law for restitution, see
Levit. 6.1, 4. Number. 5.6, 7, etc. The wrong-doer must not only confess, but
restore. The transgression was against God, but the trespass against man; and
he must be satisfied, if the sin shall be pardoned. Samuel proffered to
restore, if it might appear that he had wronged any. Micah, 1 Samuel 12.
though an Idolater, did so, Judge. 17.2, 3. So did Queen Mary, She restored
again all Ecclesiastical livings assumed to the Crown. Her Grandfather Henry
the seventh in his last Will and Testament, devised and willed restitution
should be forthwith made of all such moneys as had been unjustly levied by the
officers. Selymus the great Turk did the like upon his deathbed: so great is
the force of natural conscience; Gravel in the kidneys will not grate so much,
as a little guilt in this kind. Restore your evil-gotten goods, said father
Latimer, or else you will cough in hell, and the Devils will laugh at you. He
set this point so well home, that he wrought upon many; and particularly upon
Master Bradford. Austine says, that if a man be able to make actual
restitution, and do it not, poenitentia non agitur, sed fingitur, his
Repentance is not right: if he have wasted all, and is not able to restore, he
must desire pardon very humbly, and water the earth with his tears.

Also the hundredth part of the money] That is, all that they had received for
interest, whether money, or else. It appears by this text, that they took
twelve in the hundred (for so much the hundredth part monthly amounts to) as
at this day in Italy, and elsewhere, the Jews are permitted to strain up
their usury to eighteen in the hundred upon the Christian (for among themselves
they now use it not) which causes many of those Pseudo-Christians to use those
Jews underhand, Sands his Survey.
in improving their unlawful rents to the utmost proportion.

Verse 12. Then said they, We will restore them] This was well said: and
Nehemiah took course it should be as well done, ne dicta factis erubescerent,
as Tertullian phraseth it; that their saying and doing might be alike.

We will require nothing of them] But be of those that lend, looking for
nothing again, Luke 6.
no not the principal.

So will we do as thou have said] Denying our selves, and all worldly lusts,
that we may get and keep a good conscience, that most precious Jewel that ever
the heart of man was acquainted with.

Then I called the Priests] As fittest to tender so solemn an oath, and to
bear witness in a case of that nature.

And took an oath of them] That is, of them that had promised restitution: that
they might not start back, nor repent them of their good resolutions. Our
hearts are deceitful, and must be by all good means held up to duty, Quo teneas
vultus mutantem Protea nodo? else they will slip collar, as those slippery
Jews, Jer. 34.10, 11. retracted and repealed their vow. It was therefore well
and wisely done of Nehemiah to bind them thus to the good abearance; as Asa and
Josiah had done before him. An oath is an hedge which a man may not break;
which yet that great Heteroclite of Rome makes a sport of. For when the
Cardinals meet to choose a new Pope, they make him swear to certain Articles.
And Sleydan says, that no sooner is he chosen, but he breaks them all, and
checks their insolences, as if they went about to limit his power, to whom all
power is given in heaven and earth. Is not this that (...), that lawless,
yokelesse, masterlesse monster Saint Paul speaks of, 2 These. 2.8?

Verse 13. Also I shook my lap] By this rite (running into their senses) this
holy man runs with terrors into the eyes and hearts of all that should
perfidiously forswear themselves, by a direful denunciation of divine
vengeance. In all lawful oaths there is an imprecation, though it be not
always expressed, Genesis 14.23. Heb. 3.

So God cast out every man from his house] See Zech. 5.4, 5. with the Note.

And from his labour] i. e. From his layings-up (the fruit of his labor) his
lands and estate, got by a diligent hand. The Hebrew word signifies labor
even to lassitude and fainting.

And all the Congregation said, Amen] In token of hearty assent, and assurance.

And praised the Lord] There was a general joy, and many an humble, cheerful
and thankful heart lifted up to God for sin so redressed, and poor people
relieved.

And the people did according to this promise] This was real thankfulness. It
is not the fumbling out of a few good words (as God I thank thee, praised be
God, etc.) that will pass. Thanksdoing is the proof of Thanksgiving; and the
good life of the thankful, is the life of thankfulness. Offer unto God
thanksgiving, and pay thy vows unto the Most High, Psalm. 50.14.

Verse 14. From the time that I was appointed to be their governour] He was not
ambitious of the office, nor usurped it: but was commanded to it (as the word
signifies) by the King of Persia, and clearly called to it by God Almighty.
Otherwise he could have shrouded himself in willing secrecy, as good corn lies
in the bottom of the heap; and as good balsam sinketh to the bottom of the
vessel.

I and my brethren have not eaten the bread, etc.] Rulers, as they are
nursing-fathers to the people, Isa. 49.23. so by them they are to be nourished,
and their state maintained, See 1 Kings 4.7. It is also observed, that although
our Savior Christ wrought many miracles; yet he never wrought any about honor
or money, but that about tribute: rather then that should go undischarged, he
commanded a fish to pay it. Hence also he says not Date, Matthew. 22. Romans 13.6.
but Reddite; Give, but Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's. And
Saint Paul says, ye pay tribute, as being a due debt. Nevertheless in this
great necessity Nehemiah lets go his own right, and leaves it to others: like
as the Eagle is said, Tostat, ex Plin.
when she seeks her prey, to leave a good part thereof to the birds that
follow her, for the same end.

Verse 15. But the former Governours] Those that had been betwixt Zorobabel and
Nehemiah: Ezra was no Governor. These had been strict in exacting their five
pounds a day; or, for the head of every family, so much; besides bread for
necessity, and wine for delight. Not so Nehemiah, he would not use his power to
over-burden those poor whom these Usurers oppressed. This he here instanceth
for their further conviction.

Yea, even their servants bear rule over the people] Exacting what they please
of them: this their masters should have seen to, and not suffered for the
servants sin is the masters reproach. When Charles the fifth resolved to lay
down the Empire, some of his Courtiers and Counselors advised him to retain
still the name and authority of Emperor, and to govern the Kingdom by his
underofficers. His answer to them was, Ah, me praesente ita res administratis,
etc. Alas, now that I am amongst you, things are so ill carried, that ye are
complained of by all: what then would you do, if I should not have an eye upon
you? Val. Max. Christ. p. 197.
and how would you domineere like so many Sultans (the word here used) and
follow the administration of Justice as a trade only, with an unquenchable and
unconscionable desire of gain?

But so did not I, because of the fear of God] The best retentive from sin
certainly; a spur to good, a curb from evil. Hence David calls it a clean
fear, Psalm. 19.9. and the fear of the Lord is, to depart from evil, says
Solomon. And Aristotle has this Problem, Why are men credited more then other
creatures? The answer is, (...), because man alone holds and fears God:
therefore you may trust him. But where this fear is not, no good is to be
expected, but the contrary, Genesis 20.11. See the Note on verse 9.

Verse 16. Yea also, I continued in the work] He means, says Lyra, that he
wrought with his own hands to draw on others the more, when they should see
their Governor himself so intent to the work. He was constant at it, and held
out till all was finished. And this he records, not out of ostentation, but
to show that the love and fear of God constrained him; as it did afterward
Paul that spiritual builder, who labored more then they all, and denied
himself to bring others to heaven, as himself sets forth, 2 Cor. 11. In
praising our selves, our end must be, that our light may be seen, not our
selves seen, Matthew. 5.16. Men's praise may be sought, modo tibi non quaeras,
sed Christo, says Aretius, so that Christ be thereby set up and served.

Neither bought we any land] As easily we might have done with the surplusage
of our revenue: especially if we had exacted the utmost of our right. But
public spirits mind not their own interests Joshua divided the land to Israel,
and left none to himself: And that portion that was given him, and he content
withal, was but a mean one in the barren mountains, as Hierome observes. The
late victorious King of Sweden (a second Joshua) in his reprehensory speech to
the German plunderers, has this passage. Mr. Clark in his Life.
I protest before God, that I have not by all this war enriched my self so
far as a pair of boots comes to: yea, I had rather ride without boots,
then in the least degree to enrich my self by the damage of poor people.

Verse 17. Moreover, there were at my table, etc.] He did not eat his morsels
alone, as that Pamphagus Nabal; and as many misers now-adayes, who, like little
children, though they have their hands full, and their mouths full, yet will
part with none.

Ecce Deo similis vir dapsilis, atque benignus. Palingen.
Besides those that came unto me from among the heathen] Either as
State-Agents, or upon other occasions. Nehemiah entertained them, that they
might not lie upon the public charge. And herein he trod in the footsteps of
hospitable Abraham, whom Synesius calls (...), Gods Host. The Primitive
Christians likewise won much upon the Heathens by their hospitality toward
all, Epist. (...) Chrysostom in Joan. (...).
as Julian the Apostate confessed: all that he could say against them for it
was, that they did it all in hypocrisy, and vainglory: which was an envious
and false charge.

Verse 18. Now that which was prepared for me daily] A very great table he kept
(at his own charge all) yet nothing so great as Solomon, 1 Kings 4.22, 23. or
as once Cardinal Wolsey here; who, besides all strangers that came, had four
hundred of family, whereof one was an Earl, nine Barons, very many Knights and
Esquires. But then he had more yearly revenue then all the Bishops and Deanes
in the land had take them al together. Godw. Catal.


And once in ten dayes] Then he kept an extraordinary table inviting guess,
for whom he had store of the best wines. The Turkish Bashawes feast foreign
Ambassadors with Rice and mutton, and fair water out of the river; wine is a
forbidden ware with them: Mahomet their Prophet having told them, that in every
grape there dwelt a Devil.

Yet for all this, I required not] This he did, and this he here records: not
for a name (as Crates the Philosopher did, when he cast his goods into the Sea
merely to be talked of, and is therefore worthily called by Hierome, gloriae
animal, popularis aurae vile mancipium, Epist. ad Julian. cons.
a base slave to vainglory) but for better and higher ends, see verse 16.

Verse 19. Think upon me, my God, for good] i. e. Both of grace and glory,
says Lyra; a confluence of all comforts and contentments, especially spiritual
blessings in heavenly things, Ephesians. 1.3. He that first called riches goods,
was surely a better husband then Divine, says one. Oftendam tibi omne bonum, I
will show thee all good, said God to Moses, when he gave him a glimpse of
himself. Nil bonum absque summo Bono, says Austine, There is no good without
the chief good. Say therefore with the Church, Hos. 14.2. Take away all
iniquity, and do good; and as here, Remember me, O my God, for good.

According to all that I have done for this people] Here is nothing for
Merit-mongers. It is mercy in God to set his love on them that keep his
Commandments, Exodus 20.6. to reward every man according to his works, Psalm. 62.
ult. A poor Gardener presenting a rape root (being the best gift he had at
hand) to the Duke of Burgundy, was by him bountifully rewarded. His Steward
observing this, and hoping for the like recompense, presented him with a very
fair horse. The Duke ( ut perspicaci erat ingenio, says mine Author, being a
witty man) perceived the craft; and therefore thought good to receive the
horse, and to give him nothing again. Let those that dream of merit, expect
the like disappointment; and let them learn of Nehemiah, chap. 14.22. (the best
gloss upon this text) to urge, not their merits with the Pharisee, but their
miseries with the Publican, for obtaining mercy. So Psalm. 25.11.

CHAP. VI. Verse 1. Now it came to pass.]
LO here another let to the good work in hand. That in the fourth chapter was
external only: that in the fifth internal only: This here is mixed; that is,
partly cast in by the Enemies without (those cruel-crafties,) and partly helped
on by the perfidious Prophets and ignoble Nobles within, conspiring with the
Enemy against the good of their own Country. Thus Fluctus fluctum trudit.

And the rest of our Enemies] The Churches Enemies are not a few, 1 Cor. 16.9.
She is like unto a silly poor maid (says Luther) sitting in a Wood or
Wilderness, compassed about with hungry Wolves, Lions, Boares, Bears
assaulting her every moment, and minute. The ground of all is that old Enmity,
Genesis 3.15.

That I had builded the Wall] This Wall made Nehemiah, as Winchester-tower at
Windsor made William Wickam, Godw. Catal.
that is, raised and renowned him: and in a like sense as God is said to have
made Moses and Aaron, 1 Samuel 12.6. that is, to have advanced them, in the
hearts of his people.

And that there was no breach left therein] It had been but half-built, chap.
4.6. and the breaches but began to be stopped, ver. 7. yet now all is finished,
amidst much opposition: so shall the work of grace be in our hearts. But
whilst here, a Christian has his Vlterius still (which was Charles the fifth
his Motto,) his Superius as the guest in the Gospel that was bid to sit higher,
etc. something is yet wanting to his full and final salvation, which he is still
to work out, Philip. 2. ver. 12. like as here, the doors were not yet upon
their hinges.

Verse 2. Then Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me] As if sollicitous of my
safety, and careful of the common good. He that hates, dissembleth with his
lips, and lays up deceit within him. When he speaks fair, believe him not:
for there are seven abominations in his heart, Prove. 26.24, 25. Nehemiah well
knew that all this pretended curtesy was but dross upon dirt, ver. 23. a fair
glove drawn upon a foul hand, a cunning collusion to undo him. He therefore
keeps aloof: quia me vestigia terrent, etc.

Come let us meet together] Thus they called him to conference and consultation
whiles the doors were not yet upon the gates; purposely to take him off the
work: as the Fox diverts the Hunts-man from following the Hare: and as our
deceitful hearts do too often draw us away from the prosecution of good
purposes, by casting many other odd impertinent matters in our way.

In the plain of Ono] Which was in the tribe of Benjamin, chap. 11.30, 31. near
to Jerusalem: that he might the sooner come, and be the more secure: so the
Papists appointed Trent for their conventicle, as near to the Reformed
Churches: inviting their Divines thereunto sub fide publica: but that Council
was carried by the Pope and his accomplices, with such infinite guil and craft,
without any sincerity, upright dealing and truth, as that the Protestants,
Calvin, Bucer, etc. kept off: as seeing that it was to no purpose to come
amongst them.

But they thought to do me mischief] To kill me, or at least to captivate me.

Verse 3. And I sent Messengers unto them] He went not, but sent. This was to
be wise as a Serpent, Matthew. 10.17. God calls us not to a weak simplicity;
but allows us as much of the Serpent as of the Dove, and tells us; that a
Serpents eye in a Doves head, is a singular accomplishment. Beware of men, ver.
18. brutish persons skilful to destroy, Ezekiel. 21.31. Bless your selves from
Machiavellians (those matchless villainies) and pray with David to be delivered
from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue, Psalm. 120.2. The Cardinal of
Loraine (the chief Engineer of the French Massacre) sent to Christopher Duke of
Wirtsberg (a prudent and a valiant Prince) that he and his brethren the Guises
would embrace the Protestant Religion, and desired to be enrolled in the number
of the Protestant Princes: but they knew him too well, to trust him.

I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down] I cannot intend it, as
having my hands more full of employment, then that I can give heed to your
complements. There is a curse to him that does the work of the Lord negligently
or deceitfully. And Lata negligentia dolus est, says the Civilian; Remissness
is a kind of perfidiousnesse.

Why should the work cease?] As it would, or at least go but slowly on in his
absence: he was (...) the driver on of the business: as was likewise Boaz,
Ruth. 2.3.
who therefore followed it so close himself: his eyes were upon the Servants,
reapers, gleaners: he lodges in the midst of his husbandry. Let the Tempter
ever find us busy, and he will depart discouraged, as Cupid is said to do from
the Muses, whom he could never take idle. Standing water soon stinketh, empty
stomachs draw the humor that is next it: so does the idle heart, evil motions.
An industrious Nehemiah is not at leisure to parle with Sanballat: lest if he
let any water go beside the Mill, he should be a great loser by it. His
employment is as a guard, or good Angel, to keep him both right, and safe.

Verse 4. Yet they sent unto me four times] As thinking to prevail, by their
importunity. This, wicked men have learned of their Master Beelzebub, the lord
of Flies (as the Name signifies) or Master-flie that will not off the bait
till beaten, and hardly then. A (...).
Sin has oaded an impudency in some men's faces: and it appears they are past
all grace, because shameless; Et pudet non esse impudentes, says Austin.

And I answered them after the same manner] Nehemiah stood immovable as a
rock: He was homo quadratus, not to be altered, but firm to his principles,
resolute in his holy purposes. We may style him (as Theodoret does Athanasius)
the Bulwark of Truth, (...).
the Churches-champion. Nec temere, nec timide may seem to have been his motto,
neither temerarious, nor timorous.

Verse 5. Then sent Sanballat -- the fifth time] So restless are wicked
persons: their souls are violently tossed about, as in a sling, 1 Samuel 25.29.
Etsi non aliqua docuissent, etc. Satan, their task-master, urges them; and
when thou see them most importunate, and outrageous, Scito quia ab accensore
suo daemone perurgentur, says Bernard, Know thou that the Devil pricks them,
and kicks them on to it.

With an open Letter in his hand] Not sealed as the manner is, for secrecy
sake. The Jews use to write upon the back of their Letters, Nun, Cheth, Shin:
that is, Niddui Cherem and Shammatha, all sorts of excommunication, to him that
shall open them. But this Letter was purposely sent open, that whosoever would
might read it ere it came to Nehemiah's hand, and be warned of having hand in
the pretended treason.

Verse 6. It is reported among the Heathen] And must therefore needs be true,
like as the common sort of Turks think that whatsoever is written in their
tongue, must of necessity be believed for truth. But who knows not, that
Rumor is a loud liar; Grand Sign. Serag. 171.
and that every public person needs carry a spare hankerchief to wipe off
dirt cast upon him by disaffected persons, that seek to fly-blow their
reputation, and to deprave their best actions.

And Jashmu says so] Geshmu alias Geshem the Arabian, ver. 1.2. a worthy
wight, a credible witness. Nehemiah might well have replied as Seneca did in
like case. Malae de me loquuntur, sed mali. Gashmu's tongue was no slander: for
he was known to be mendaciorum artifex, one that had taught his tongue the art
of lying, Jer. 9.3, 5. and had taken fast hold of deceit, Jer. 8.5. Such of
late time were those loud and lewd liars, Genebrard, Scioppius, Baldwin, and
Bolsecus, who being requested by the Popish side to write the lives of Calvin
and Beza, is in all their writings alleged as Canonical, though they know him
to be (according to the old Proverb) a Friar, a Liar.

That thou and the Jews think to rebel] A likely matter: but that matters not.
Any Author serves Sanballats turn, who for a need could have sucked such an
accusation as this, out of his own fingers, See Ezra 4.13.

For which cause thou buildest the Wall] This was calumniari audacter, as
Machiavel taught, aliquid saltem adhaerebit. But if dirt will stick to a
mudwal, Speed. 804,
yet to marble it will not. Nehemiah has the Euge of a clear conscience, and
no Wiseman will believe this black-mouthed Blatero. N. D. Author of the three
conversions, has made Sr. John Oldcastle the Martyr, a Ruffian, a Robber, and
a Rebel. His authority is taken from the Stage Players, of like conscience for
lies, as all men know.

That thou may be their King] King of the Jews, As they called our Savior,
John 19.12. And as some think the ground of this report (if any there were)
concerning Nehemah's practicing to be King, were the prophesies of Haggai and
Zachary concerning the near approach of Christ's Kingdom.

Nihil est, quin male narrando, possit depravarier. Terent.
According to these words] According to this report: or somewhat to the same
sense.

Verse 7. And thou have also appointed Prophets, etc.] That the thing might
seem to be of God: as the Beast has his False-prophet, that wrought miracles
before him, Rev. 19.20. As Mahomet had his prophets, and John of Leyden had his
to cry him up King of Munster, the new Jerusalem (as they called it) yea of all
Nations, to rule them with a rod of iron.

And now shall it be reported to the King] Who must needs be highly displeased,
and will as little endure it, Rominos geminos unum non caperet Regnu^, quos
unum uteri ceperat hospitiu^, Cyprian.
as the Heaven two Suns. Sol quasi solus: sic Monarcha. Marriage and Monarchy
will not away with corrivals.

Come now therefore, and let us take counsel] In commune consulere, lest we all
suffer for your fault. But neither was good Nehemiah in any fault: neither was
their drift any other but this, to draw him out of the City, that they might
mischieve him: like as Dr. Bristow advises his Catholics to get the
Protestants out of their strong-hold of the Scriptures into the open Field of
Fathers and Councels: and then they might do what they would with us.

Verse 8. There are no such things done as thou sayest] Nehemiah is not
over-carefull to clear himself. This was so transparent a lie, that a man might
see thorough it, and was therefore best answered with a neglective denial. It
falls out often, that playn-dealing puts craft out of countenance. Animus
recti conscius objecta probra ut visus nocturnos and vanas somniorum imagines
digno supplicio punit, festivo scilicet contemptu, and oblivione: vel, si tanti
est, misericordia elevat. Joh. Woner.


Verse 9. For they all made us afraid] This they aimed at: but could not attain
unto; for faith quelleth and kills distrustful fear, Psalm. 46.1, 2. Audacia
est pro muro, says Sallust. Let the wicked fly when none pursues, but the
righteous will be bold as a Lion. Prove. 28 1.


Saying, their hand shall be weakened from the work] So measuring them by
themselves, as if they would have been soon scared and discouraged. But they
knew not the Aes triplex, the power of the Spirit, that Spirit of power
(opposed to the spirit of fear,) of love, and of a sound mind, 2 Timothy 1.7. They
knew not the privy armor of proof, that these good Jews had about their hearts.

Now therefore, O God, strengthen mine hands] He acknowledges himself to be
in the condition of a poor Garrison-souldier; that has no help or supplies but
from the Captain of his salvation: which therefore he thus humbly calls in,
and craveth. Of ejaculations, See Chap. 2. ver. 4. This here is dispatched in
four words.

Verse 10. Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah] Perhaps the same that
is mentioned, Ezra 8.16. but now fallen, as a Star from Heaven. Blazing Stars
were never but Meteors. Demas not only forsook Paul, but became a Priest in an
idols Temple at Thessalonica, 1 Chronicles. 24.18.
if Dorotheus may be believed. A Priest Shemajah was, would seem to be a
Prophet: but he proved not right. All is not gold that glisters. It was
Tobiah's gold that made him a Prophet, as Philips gold made the oracle of
Apollo give what answer he pleased. A house he had in the Temple: and there he
had reclused and shut up himself, that he might seem some singular Devoto,
expecting a revelation from Heaven: or as one who sequestered himself from
company of others, with a stand further off; come not near, for I am holier
then thou. Or, lastly, to persuade people that there was a necessity of
securing themselves from the night-inrodes of the Enemy. Whatever it was that
he was thus (Anchoret-like) pent up, or locked up, or deteyned (as Junius
renders it, see the like said of Doeg, that bloody Edomite, 1 Samuel 21.7.)
Nehemiah went to his house to know what was the matter: supposing him to be a
friend, but finding him suborned by the Enemy.

Let us meet together in the House of God] Famous for sanctity and safety:
being within Gods precincts, we shall surely be under his protection.

And let us shut the doors of the Temple] Immure our selves, and keep out the
Enemy. But, this had been the ready way to invite them, seeing his cow a dise:
for maximum his periculum qui maxim timent (says Sallust.) nothing betrays a
man sooner then his causeless fear. God helps the valiant. Besides, Shemaiah
and his false accomplices, having got Nehemiah to them from his friends and
followers, might have done what they pleased with him; as the Romans did by
Caesar, in the Senat-house.

For they will come to stay thee] And Nehemiah must be made believe, that
Shemaiah, as a special friend, wished no long life, and was zealous for it:
whence he so doubleth his prediction of the danger. O deep dissimulation!

Verse 11. And I said, should such a man as I fly?] To the dishonor of God,
and the discouraging of the people? to the scandal of the weak, and the scorn
of the wicked? Et Turnum fugientem haec terra videbit? There is a (...), a
comeliness, a seemlinesse, a suitableness appertains to every calling and
condition of life: and Nature has taught Heathens themselves to argue from
dignity to duty, and to scorn to do any thing unworthy of themselves. Scipio,
when an harlot was offered him answered, Vellem, si non essem Imperator, I
would, were I not a General. Antigonus being invited to a Feast where a notable
harlot was to be present, asked counsel of Menedemus, what he should do? No
more but this, said he, Remember that thou art a Kings son. (...).
Themistocles once, after a Victory, viewing the spoils and pillage of the
field, said to his friend that bare him company, Take thou these rich spoils
to thy self: for thou are not Themistocles: it is below me to stoop to them.
When Pompey had Caesar and Anthony in a Ship together, it was suggested to him
by Metrodorus, to revenge himself for the death of his Father and Brother. To
whom he replied, that so to do, might happily befit Metrodorus, but in no wise
Pompey. It is not for you to be fishing for Gudgeons, but for Towns, Forts, and
Castles, said Cleopatra to M. Antony. It is not for Gods Saints to walk as men:
since they are children of the Kingdom, and must therefore regnum in pectore
gerere, carry themselves accordingly. We usually say, such a man understands
himself well: that is, he knows his place, his dignity, and walks accordingly.
It is a pusillanimity to do otherwise; Nehemiah will never do it, to dye for it.

And now is there, that being as I am] So greatly beloved of God, Dan. 9.23. so
highly favored of the King, chap. 2.2, 4. so protected hitherto, so prospered,
so entrusted with the government and safety of this people, more dear to me
then my very life.

Would go into the Temple] As a Malefactor to take Sanctuary there; or as a
Coward to save mine own life with the loss of the lives of many of the
precious sons of life. Zion.

I will not go in] The Heavens shall sooner fall then I will forsake the Truth,
Will. Flower. Act. and Mon. 1430. In Epist.
said that Martyr. Omnia de me praesumas praeter fugam and palinodiam, said
Luther to Staupicius, I Will rather dye, then fly: burn them turn. Latimer was
wondrous bold and stout in his dealing with Henry the eighth, both before and
after he was a Bishop. So were Athanasius, Ambrose, Basil; the primitive
Confessors. This courage in Christians the Heathen persecutours called
Obstinacy, and not faith. Sed pro hac obstinatione fidei morimur, says
Tertullian in his Apology, For this obstinacy of faith we gladly dye: neither
can we dye otherwise; for the love of Christ constrains us. Life in Gods
displeasure is worse then death: as death; in his true favor, is true life: as
Bradford told Gardener.

Verse 12. And so I perceived that God had not sent him] By my spiritual
sagacity I smelt him out: as having mine inward senses habitually exercised to
discern good and evil, Heb. 5. ult. Does not the ear try words, as the mouth
tastes meat, Job 12.11? What though we have not received the Spirit of the
World, (we cannot cog and comply as they can, yet) we have received a better
thing, the Spirit of God, the mind of Christ, 1 Cor. 2.12, 16.

But that he pronounced this prophecy against me] To make my righteous soul sad
with his ^yes, Ezekiel. 13.22. and to bring me to disgrace, and danger. Luther was
wont to advise Preachers, to see that these three Dogs did not follow them into
the pulpit: Pride, Covetousness, and Envy.

For Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him] A mere mercenary he was then, and had
Linguam Vaenalem: he could call good evil, and evil good, justify the wicked
for a reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him, Isa.
5.20. Such false prophets were Dr Shaw, and Friar Pinket in Rich. the thirds
time, who made use of them as his Factours to obtrude bastardy on his brother
King Edward the fourth, and so to disable his children for the Crown, that he
might settle it upon his own head. Dan. Hist.
What became of Pinket I know not, but Shaw (as ashamed of his Sermon at Paul's
cross) disconsolately departed, and never after that was publicly seen. Like
unto these, were Bishop Bourn, and Cardinal Pool in Q. Mary's days. The
Cardinal, hired with the Archbishopric of Canterbury, took for his Text, Esaias
66.8. and applied it to England, as then happily reduced to the Popes
obedience. Bourn, for the Bishopric of B^th, preached such staff at
Pauls-cross, that the people were ready to tear him in pieces, They flang a
Dagger at him in the Pulpit. Phlugius, Melch. Adam.
and Sidonius, Authors of the Popish Book published in Germany by the name of
Interim, Chrisma and oleum pontificium defendebant, ut ipsi discederent
unctiores, defended Chrisme, and extreme unction, as being liquoured in the
fists, and promoted to fat Bishoprics. But a Minister, as he should have
nothing to lose, so he should have as little to get: he should be above all
price or sale. Nec prece, nec pretio should be his Motto.

Verse 13. Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid] But they were much
mistaken in their aims: this matter was not malleable. Nehemiah was a man of
another spirit; of a Caleb-like spirit: he was fide armatus, Deo armatus, and
therefore undaunted: he was full of Spiritual mettle, for he knew whom he had
trusted.

And do so, and sin] Nehemiah feared nothing but sin, and the fruit thereof,
shame and reproach; so great was his spirit, so right set were both his
judgment and affections. But if any thing would have drawn him aside from the
straight ways of the Lord, base fear was the likeliest: as we see in David at
Gath, and Peter in the Highpriests hall. See Zeph. 3.13. with the Note.
Pessimus in dubiis Augur Timer.

And that they might have matter for an evil report] This, wicked men watch
for, as a Dog does for a bone: and if they get but the least hint, oh how happy
do they hold themselves! what wide mouths do they open, etc! It is our part
therefore (by a Nehemiah-like conversation) to put to silence the ignorance of
foolish men, who, like Black-moores, despise beauty; like Dogs, bark at the
shining of the Moon. Of Luther it was said by Erasmus, Nec hosts reperiant
quod calumnientur. Of B. Hooper it is said, that his life was so good, that no
kind of slander (although diverse went about to reprove it) could fasten any
fault upon him. Act. and Mon. 1366.
The like is reported of Bradford, and Bucer. We should so carry our selves, ut
nemo de nobis male loqui absque mendacio possit, as Hierom has it: that none
might speak evil of us, without a manifest lie.

Verse 14. My God, think upon Tobiah and Sanballat] Heb. Remember, to be
revenged on them q.d. I cannot deal with them, but do thou do it. He does
himself no disservice (says one) who when no Law will relieve him, makes God
his Chancellor. It is a fearful thing to be put over into his punishing hands
by the Saints, as Joab and Shimei were unto Solomon's hands by dying David. If
men, in their best estate, are so weak that they are crushed before the moth,
how shall they stand before this great God?

According to these their works] Qualia quisque facit, talia quisque luat: Let
them drink as they have brewed.

And on the Prophetess Noadiah] Who joined with Shemaiah in this
dissimulation, and was of his counsel. Omne malum ex gynaecio. False Prophets
and Seducers are seldom without their Women. Simon Magus had his Helena,
Carpocrates his Marcellina, Apelles his Philumena, Montanus his Priscilla, and
Maximilla, etc.

And the rest of the Prophets] Improperly so called, but so they pretended to
be; and here they had conspired, a great sort of them, to do evil.

That would have put me in fear] By their concurrent prophesies, purposely to
disgrace and endanger me: Suffragia non sunt numeranda, sed expendenda.
Multitude and antiquity are but ciphers in Divinity.

Verse 15. So the Wall was finished] Though with much ado, and maugre the
malice of all foreign and intestine Enemies. So shall the work of grace in men's
hearts: it is perfected there by opposition; and grows gradually, but
constantly and infallibly.

In the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul] Which was their sixth month,
answering, most what, Beda.
to our August. This (says one) answered both unto the six days of Gods
working to make the World, after which a rest followed, and to the everlasting
rest in Heaven after six ages of the World, spent in toil and labor!

In fifty and two dayes] A very short time for the dispatch of so great a work.
But nescit tarda molimina Spiritus Sancti gratia. God was much seen herein: and
the Enemies courage much quailed.

Verse 16. But what meant Josephus to say, that the wall was in building two
years and three months? It appears hereby, and by many other passages in
his Jewish antiquities, that he had not much read, or at least minded the holy
Scriptures. Of this short time spent in building the Wall, Daniel seems to
prophecy, says an Interpreter, when he says, Dan. 9.25.
that it should be built again in angustiis temporum in the straits of time:
neither held we so much strange at it, since the hands at it were many, and
those were motitantes, nimble and cheerful; and the Princes were present to
prick them on, and they repaired only and built upon the old foundation: And
lastly the very Enemies were convinced, that the work was wrought of God, ver.
16. what marvel therefore that it went so on end?

Verse 16. When all our Enemies heard thereof] So famous a matter could not be
concealed from them who listened with the lest care, and readily received these
(...), as the Greeks call, galling reports.

Saw these things] For they ran to the sight of it, as to a miracle; they
looked also upon it with an evil and envious eye: like as the Papists do upon
the Reformation.

They were much cast down in their own eyes] They were crest-faln, and dejected
from the high-tops of their proud hopes, and designs. See what biles and
ulcers the Antichristian rout are vexed with, and how they are scorched with
the Sunshine of the Gospel, Rev. 16.2, 11. What moan Babels Merchants make to
see her ruin and the rise of the new Jerusalem, chap. 18. ver. 11. Envy is
vitium Diabolicum, the Devils disease, says Austin: and those that are
troubled with it, In Psalm. 139.
can never want woe.

For they perceived that this work was wrought of God] with such incredible
swiftness was it carried on and accomplished, that they could not but say
among the Heathen, The Lord has done great things for them; God is with them
of a truth.

Verse 17. Moreover in those days the Nobles of Judah] Heb. The White ones:
either, because they went in white garments, as Joseph, Mordecai, etc. or
because they were illustrious and famous for wisdom and virtue. But in these
Nobles of Judah was nomen inane, crimen immane. Here was seeds prima, vita ima,
dignitas in indigno; hoc est, ornamentum in luto, white garments they might
have, but withal, sooty souls, and black manners.

Sent many Letters unto Tobiah] Heb. Multiplied their Letters (or Packets)
walking to Tobiah, with whom thereby they held correspondency; as at this day
they do with the Turkish Visiers and Basha's of state, giving them continual
intelligence of the affairs of Christendom, and advising most of that mischief
which the Turk puts in execution against us.

Verse 18. For there were many in Judah sworn unto him] Besides that
intercourse of Letters aforementioned, Tobiah had his pensioners among the
Jews, who were his sworn servants, and had taken oath, or (as the Hebrew has
it) they were Lords of an oath to him. In the year 1583. Girald Earl of
Desmond's men had barbarously vowed to forswear God, before they would forsake
him. Camb. Elisab. Fol. 258.
I know not what these Jews had sworn to Tobiah (to be true to him likely, and
to prosecute his designs:) but those of them at this day living are great
Swearers (they were so in St. James his time, chap. 9.12.) but they keep no
oath, unless they swear upon their own Torah, or Book of the Law, Weemse.
brought out of their Synagogues.

Because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah] One of those corrupt Nobles, ver.
17. and Meshullam was another, who also helped to build the Wall, chap. 3.4.
and seemed forward, but now shows himself in his colors. Thou may be the
Fore-horse in the teem (says One) a Ringleader of good exercises as Joash, 2 Chronicles. 24.4, 5, 6. Thou may flock after zealous Preachers, as those did
after John Baptist, Matthew. 3. Yea stand out in persecution, and not shrink in
the wetting, as the thorny ground did not; and yet be no better than a very
painted hypocrite.

Verse 19. Also they reported his good deeds before me] Heb. His goodnesses, as
if he had been another Phocion, who was surnamed the good. But this was but in
their opinion only, who had little enough goodness, and skill to judge of it.
Or if there were any good in him, yet Sunt bona mista malis; and of him might
be said, as once of Sfortza Duke of Millain, Folieta Galeazo.
that he was a very Monster, made up and compact of Virtue, and Vice.

CHAP. VII. Verse 1. When the Wall was built.]
FOR better defense of the City. Moenia, a munienda urbe dicuntur.

And I had set up the doors] We may not take this expression for a
vainglorious haec ego feci, such as was that of Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 4.30.
boasting as if he (and not Ninus) had built Babel, when he enlarged it only,
and built the Palace: Or that of Augustus, Vrbem ego lateritiam inveni,
marmoream reliqui. We read of one Lampadius a Noble man in Rome, Am. Marcellini.
who per omnia Civitatis membra, through all parts of the City, where other
great men had bestowed cost in building, he would set up his own Name (not as a
Repairer of the work neither, but) as the chief builder. Trajan the Emperor
also is said to have been sick of this disease: and was therefore called by way
of jeare Wallweed. But good Nehemiah was none such: he was humiliter sublimis,
and sublimiter humilis, Herba pa^ietina.
as Cyprian phraseth it that is, humbly lofty, and loftily humble; humble in
heart, (...)
and yet high in worth and works, as Nazianzen says of Athanasius.

And the Levites were appointed] Viz. to their several services in the Temple,
(as David had distributed them:) after that they had been otherwise employed
about the building.

Verse 2. That I gave my brother Hanani] Of whom see chap. 1.2. Ezra 10. ver.
20.

And Hananiah the Ruler of the palace] The second person next to the Governor:
commanding in his Name within his Court.

Charge over Jerusalem] Thus he that is faithful in a little, shall be made
Master of much, Matthew. 25.31.

For he was a faithful man] Heb. A man of Truth, Faithfulness, or Firmness;
a sure man, and such as one might safely confide in.

And feared God] No wonder therefore though faithful to men, See chap. 5.15.
Gods holy fear is the ground of all goodness and fidelity. Hence Jethro, in
his well-qualified Ruler, places the fear of God in the midst of the other
graces, as the heart in the body, for conveying life to all the parts, or as a
dram of Musk, perfuming the whole box of ointment, Exodus 18.21. Most sure it
is, that nothing makes a man so good a Patriot, as the true fear of God: On
the other side, Pietate sublata fides tollitur, take away Piety, and Fidelity
is gone: as is to be seen in the unrighteous Judge, Luke 18. ver. 2. and as
Constantius Chlorus, father of Constantine the Great, did well experience in
his Counselors and Courtiers, whence that famous Maxim of his recorded by
Eusebius, He cannot be faithful to me, that is unfaithful to God, Religion
being the foundation of all true fidelity and loyalty to King and Country. 1
Pet 2.
Hence that close connection, Fear God, Honor the King. And hence that saying
of Bernard, If all the World should conspire to make me complot against my
Prince; yet I would fear God, and honor the King.

Above many] This is a singular praise, and by every man to be sought after:
('it was Cicero's posy and practice, (...). to be the best at every good thing,
to excel and exceed others) to be eminent and exemplary, taller then the rest
by the head and shoulders full of all goodness, filled with all knowledge,
Romans 15.14, able and active in every good word and work. That Is a low and
unworthy strain in some to labor after no more grace then will keep life and
soul together, that is, soul and hell asunder. God would have his people to be
discontentedly contented with the measures they have received, and to be still
adding, 2 Pet. 1.5. and advancing, Philip. 3.14. aspiring to perfection, till
they come unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. Ephesians. 4.13.

Verse 3. (...) Job 30.28.
Till the Sun be hot] The Sun has one of his names, in Hebrew, a calefaciendo,
from heating, there is nothing hid from the heat thereof, Psalm. 19.6. The name
here given to the Sun signifies a minister, or servant: because it is the
common servant of the World, whereby God ministers light, heat, and precious
fruits to all people, Deuteronomy. 4.19. and 33.14. It whirleth about the World with
incredible swiftness; and is up in a morning before most people. Therefore
till the Sun be risen the Gates must be kept shut, to keep out the Enemy, who
watches his opportunity.

And while they stand by] to see it done as it ought to be; lest by the
treachery or carelessness of Underofficers, it should either be undone, or
ill-done. Etiam Tractate, Junius.
Let them feel with their hands, (so some render it) whether the Gates are made
fast or not.

And appoint watches] Heb. Set thou watches. He speaks to the two Hanani's,
and bids each of them, whose turn it was, see to the well-doing of it. Hoc tu
facias, Cyropaed.
Xenophon says of Cyrus, that when he gave any thing in command, he never
said, Let some one do this, but do thou this.

Verse 4. Now the City was large] Heb. Broad in spannes, or spaces. And great]
Yet nothing so great as Niniveh was of old; or Babylon then; or Alcair, and
Quinsay at this day. Of the former, Bunting says, that it is threescore miles
in compass. Of the Later Paulus Venetus (who himself dwelt therein about the
year 1260) writes, that it is an hundred miles about, being of all the Cities
in the World the greatest. Jerusalem was a great City and spacious, though it
fell far short of these.

And the people were few therein] But how exceedingly they multiplied
afterward appears by those many thousands of persons there destroyed and
carried away by the Romans at the last desolation: as testifies Josephus an
eyewitness, quem lege, and luge. For present, they were so few, that they
were not able, without help; to defend the walls in so large a circuit.

And the houses were not builded] All could not be done in a day. But some
seiled houses there were, Hag. 1. ver. 4. and Nehemiah was all his time busy
in building the old wast places, and raising up the foundations of many
generations: so that he was worthily called, The Repairer of the breach, the
Restorer of paths to dwell in, Esaias 58.12. Eusebius says Nehemiah was twelve
years in building the Walls: he should have said, the City: Hierome likewise
says, that he came to Jerusalem, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes: and made
an end of building the Wall and City in the two and thirtieth year: so that,
during the whole twelve years of his Government, he was in action.

Verse 5. And my God put into my heart] Seeing how thinly the City was
inhabited, and casting in his mind, what evil might come of it, he bethinks
himself (by a motion from Heaven) how to set things to rights: that the City
might be better peopled, and (so) preserved. This to do, God put into his heart
by his holy Spirit (the sweet motions whereof, are the sound of his goings, the
footsteps of his anointed, Psalm. 89.51.) We are not sufficient of our selves
(says that great Apostle) to think any thing as of our selves: but our
sufficiency is of God, 2 Cor. 3.5. Nemo Vir magnus sine aliquo afflatu Divino
unquam fuit, says Cicero: No man ever grew to be greatly good, without a
Divine instinct.

To gather together the Nobles and the Rulers, etc.] That out of them a tenth
man might be taken to furnish out the City, chap. 11.1. after that they had
been first prepared by the hearing of the Law, chap. 8.2.

That they might be reckoned by their genealogies] And so, Jerusalem be
inhabited again, Zach. 12, 6.
in her own place, even in Jerusalem.

Verse 6. These are the children, etc.] See Ezra 2. ver. 1, 2, 3, etc. with the
Notes. Some small differences there are in Names and Numbers between this
Catalogue, and that: not by the negligence of the Scribes who wrote out this
Register, as Pelican would have it, but by other means, as is above-noted.

CHAP. VIII. Verse 1. As one man.]
See Ezra 3.1. and remember that Omne simile non est idem: this is a distinct
History from that.

Into the street] Or, open place, the meeting place of the watergate, See
chap. 3. ver. 26. Right over against this Gate, was the Court of the people,
says Lyra, See Ezra 10. ver. 9.

And they spoke unto Ezra the Scribe] The people may, Col. 4.17. 1 Cor. 3.22.
if need be, say to Archippus, Look to thy ministry, etc.] Whether Paul, or
Apollo, or Cephas, All is theirs; (the gifts and abilities of all good
Ministers) and they may call for them.

To bring the Book of the Law of Moses] Wherein he was noe less able, then apt
to impart, 1 Timothy 3.2. (...).
He knew that the best had need hear the Law, ne spiritum sess^rem excutiant,
that they might be kept within the bounds of obedience. Not the unruly colt
only, but the Horse that is broken, has a bit and bridle also.

Verse 2. And Ezra the Priest brought the Law] The Commandment (he knew well)
was a Lamp, and the Law a light; and reproofs of instruction the way of life,
Prove. 6.23. The Greeks call the Law (...) quasi (...), Plato in Cratylo.
the standing mind of God. And if Demosthenes could say of men's Laws, that
they were the invention of God; If Xenophon could say of the Persian Laws,
that they kept the people, even from coveting any wickedness: If Cicero durst
say of the Roman Laws, (...).
that they far excelled and exceeded all the learned Libraries of the
Philosophers, both in weight and worth: How much more may all this, and more be
said of this perfect Law of God, the book whereof was here brought forth by
Ezra, and read and expounded in the ears of all the people?

Before the Congregation, both of Men and Women] Heb. from Man to Woman; for
souls have no sexes: and in Christ there is no difference, Gal. 4.28. The Jews
at this day little regard their Women; not suffering them to come within their
Synagogue. And the Turkish Women never go to their Moschees; neither is there
any heed taken or reckoning made of their Religion at all. The Papists. say, a
that Distaffe is fitter for a woman then a Bible.


And all that could hear with understanding] i.e. Children also, that were of
any grouth. Little Pitchers have ears, and little children will understand
much, if well principled.

Upon the first day of the seventh moneth] A month of more solemnities then
any other: this first day was a double holy day, Levit. 23.24. See Deuteronomy. 31.11.

Verse 3. And he read therein] As a Scribe, he wrote the Law and as a Priest,
he read and expounded it. This was Christ's own custom, Luke 4.16. and the Jews
Acts 13, 15, 27. and 15.21. and is still to this day: One lesson is ever read,
out of the Law in their public meetings: and another out of the Prophets
correspondent to the former in argument. The Holy Scripture is called Mikre the
Reading, ver. 9. of this chapter, because it ought to be read to all: and the
Word, as if all the use of our ears were to hear this Word.

From the morning until mid-day] This was a great while; five or six hours
together they spent in holy duties, whereas the most amongst us think long of
an hour: they sit as it were in the Stocks whiles they are hearing the Word
read or preached, and come out of the Church, when the tedious Sermon runs
somewhat beyond the glass, like prisoners out of a gaol.

And the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book] Heb. Were to the
Book of the Law: which phrase imports both their attention and affection to
what they heard delivered. They drew up the ears of their souls to the ears of
their bodies; and so one sound pierced both. See the like Luke 19.48. they hung
upon Christ's Holy lips, as loath to lose any part of that precious language. The
Jews at this day, though they give very great outward respect to their Torah or
Book of the Law (carrying it about their Synagogue at the end of Service in
procession, and the like) yet for any show of attention or elevation of spirit,
I could never discern (says one that had been much amongst them) but they are
as reverent in their Synagogues, as Grammar-boyes are at School, when their
Master is absent.

Verse 4. And Ezra the Scribe stood upon a Pulpit of wood] Heb. A Tower of
wood, because high and round, as ours are. The Cappuchines and other Popish
preachers are said to have long Pulpits, wherein they may walk and act, as upon
stage, in Lent esp^cially: at which time it is the custom of Italy for the
same man to preach six days in the week upon the Gospel of the days, and on
the Saturday in honor and praise of the Virgin Mary.

And beside him stood Vattithiah, etc.] For greater authority sake, as
concurring with Ezra, and ready in their turn to perform the work.
Praedicationis officium suscipit quisquis ad sacerdotium accedit, said Gregory
long since. No preacher, is no Minister.

Verse 5. And Ezra opened the Book] Gods Book: not Aristotle's Ethiks, as
Melancthon says, he heard some Popish Priests preaching upon Texts thence
taken. And C^rolostadius was eight years Doctor, when he first opened the
Bible: and yet at the taking of his degree, he had been pronounced
Sufficientissimus.

For he was above all the people] Both in place, and office: as representing
the person of God, and bearing his Name unto his People.

All the people stood up] For reverence sake. So did Eglon that fat King of
Moab, when he heard of a message from God, Judge. 3.20. Balaam being to utter
his parable, biddes Balak arise up and hear him. Our Savior stood up to read
his Text. Luke 4.16. Constantine the Great, and our King Edward the sixth would
not hear a Sermon but standing. The modern Jews show their reverence to their
Law by a like gesture; and their adoration is by bowing forward of their
bodies: for, kneeling they use none, neither stir they their bonnets in their
Synagogues, but remain still covered.

Verse 6. And Ezra blessed the Lord] i. e. He called upon the Lord, who is
worthy to be praised, Psalm. 18.3. He prayed before he read, and preached. So
ought we to do by his example, as Lyra well notes, and as is commonly done by
all our Ministers. Luthers usual prayer before Sermon was this, Confirm, O God,
in us what thou have wrought: and perfect the work that thou have begun to thy
glory. Lord open our eyes that we may see the wonders of thy Law, etc.
Zuinglius began his public Lectures thus, O Almighty Everlasting and Merciful
God, whose Word is a light to our feet, and a Lanthorn to our paths, open and
illighten our minds, that we may piously and holily understand thine oracles,
and be so transformed thereinto, that we may not in any thing displease thy
Majesty, thorough Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen. The Platonists could say, that
the light of our minds whereby we learn al^things; is no other but God himself,
the same that made all things. This made Ezra here bless the Lord, that is,
say with David, Psalm. 119. ver. 12. Blessed be thou, O Lord, teach us thy
Statutes.

The great God] The true Trismegist, the Fortissimus Maximus, Opt. Max. All
whose attributes are in the highest degree, yea in a degree beyond any
superlative.

And all the people answered, Amen, Amen] This word is Hebrew: but used in all
Languages, in the close of prayers. The doubling of it here imports their
assent, and their assurance. It is the voice of one that believes, and
expects that he shall have his prayers granted. The Septuagint render it so
be it, or so it is. The Apostle reckons it for a great loss, when people
either say not Amen to public prayers, or not heartily and affectionately, as
here, 1 Cor. 14.16. Else, When thou shall bless with the spirit, how shall he
that occupies the room of the unlearned say, Amen? The Turks also when their
Priest has said his Letany (such as it is) make answer in manner of a shout
Homin, that is, Amen.

With lifting up their hands] And withal their hearts unto God in the Heavens,
Lam. 3.41. This, Nazianzen judges to be optimum opus manuum, the best work of
the hands, sc. in Coelos eas extendere, ad precesque expandere, to stretch them
toward Heaven, and to hold them out in prayer. This way David ennobled his
tongue (therefore called his glory) and so men may their hands.

And they bowed their heads] In token of the lowliness of their hearts. These
outward gestures, as they issue from the fervency of a good heart, so they
reflect upon the affections, and do further inflame them. Only note, that
these bodily exercises are not always or absolutely necessary in Divine
worship. God looks chiefly at the heart, and hates all outside-service, and
heartlesse devotion, Isa. 1. and 66.3. and such as is that of the Jews at this
day. Their holiness, says One, is the outward work it self, being a
brainlesse head, and soul-lesse body. And the like may be said of the Papist,
and of the common Protestant, whose body is prostrate, but his soul
bolt-upright within him.

Verse 7. Also Jeshua and Bani, etc. caused the people to understand the Law]
As the audience was great, so, great was the company of Preachers, Psalm. 68.11.
The people were too many to be taught by one: therefore they made sundry
Companies and Congregations, and had several Teachers: as had likewise those
primitive Christians, Act. 1. and 3. when once they grew numerous.

And the people stood in their places] Heb. And the people upon their stand;
They kept their stations according to their divisions: not shuffling, or
shifting from Preacher to Preacher, but abiding and attending with utmost
intention and retention.

Verse 8. Explanate Junius.
So they read in the Book in the Law of God distinctly] Exposite, clare, vel
cum expositione. They read aloud, and so treatably and plainly, that all might
know what they read. Some stumble over the chapter so fast, that few are the
better.

And gave the sense] Viz. by comparing place with place, and interpreting one
Scripture by another. See the like done by St. Paul at Damascus, Act. 9.22. he
laid one Text to another, (...).
as Artificers do the several pieces of their work, that they may perfectly
agree the one with the other.

Causing the people to understand the reading] Dabant intelligentiam per
scripturam ipsam, so Tremellius renders it. Of the Law it may be said, Et
latet, and l^cet. The Prophets are as so many expositours and explainers
thereof: they do excellently unfold and draw out that arras which was folded
together before: they give us Moses unveiled. Search the Scriptures therefore,
and compare them. Parallel texts, like glasses, set one against another, do
cast a mutual light: like the Sun, the Scriptures show other things, and
themselves too.

Verse 9. Mr. Clarks Lives, Part. 2. page 31.
And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshata] Or Governor, See Ezra 2.63. He had
Jovianus the Emperors wished happiness, which was, that he might govern wise
men, and that wise men might govern him.

And Ezra the Priest and Scribe] See ver. 3.

And the Levites that taught the people] That numerus nominum, id est, hominum
mentioned, ver. 7. Men most happy in such melting hearers. We now-adayes
prevail as little, as Bede did, when he preached to an heap of stones.

This day is holy unto the Lord your God] Your mourning therefore, now is as
much out of season, as Sampson's Wives weeping was at her wedding. All Gods
worships were to be celebrated with joy, Deuteronomy. 12.7. and sacrifices offered in
mourning, were abomination, Hos. 9.4. See Mal. 2.13. with the Note.

Mourn not, nor weep] Sc. Under sense of sin, and fear of wrath. This they were
called to at another time, Esaias 22.12. Jam. 4 9, 10. but every thing is
beautiful in its season, Eccles. 3.3.

For all the people wept when they heard the words of the Law] For like cause
as Josiah did, 2 King. 22.11, 19. His tender heart was troubled and terrified
by the menaces of Gods mouth uttered against his and the peoples sins. Hence
some infer, that it was the Decalogue (together with the malediction) that
was now read and applied: and that made them weep so fast. Get thee Gods Law,
(says holy Bradford) as a glass to look in -- so shall you see your face
foul-arrayed, and so shameful, mangy, pockey, and scabbed, that you cannot but
be sorry at the contemplation thereof -- especially if you look to the tag tied
to Gods Law: which is such, Sermon. of Rep. page 20.26, 27.
as cannot but make us cast our currish tails betwixt our legs, if we
believe it. But oh faithless hard hearts! O Jezebels guests, rocked and laid
asleep in her bed, etc.!

Verse 10. Then he said unto them, Go your way] A friendly dismission. We must
so reproove or admonish others, as that we ever preserve in them an opinion of
our good will unto them: for this is that sugar, that sweetneth all such tarter
pills.

Go your way, eat, etc] One being asked whether a good man might not feed upon
sweet and delicate meat; eat the fat, and drink the sweet, even the choysest
Wines and chiefest viands? answered, Yes: except God made bees only for fools.
God freely permits to his best children the use of his best creatures, even
to an honest affluence (on Thanksgiving-dayes especially) provided, that they
feed with fear, and keep within the bounds of sobriety.

And send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared] That is, to the poor,
the fatherless and the widows, Deuteronomy. 16.14. Who have not their set meals:
nor certain dishes: but as hard fare for their holy day cheer, as Christ's
Disciples had once for their Sabbath-dayes dinner, Matthew. 12.1.

For this day is holy unto the Lord] An holy convocation Lev. 23.24. a day of
blowing Trumpets, a feast day, See Zach. 8.19. with the Note. A more liberal
use of the creature dilateth and exhilarateth the heart, and so disposes it to
thankfulness, Jam. 5.13. Psalm. 92.2, 3. Eat, that thy soul may bless me, Genesis
27.19. The idolatrous Israelites sat down to eat, and drink, and then rose up
to play. Gods people should much more rejoice in the Lord, when refreshed by
the creatures, speaking good of his Name, and serving him with cheerfulness in
the abundance of all things, Deuteronomy. 28.47.

Neither be ye sorry] No not for your sins now, least it prove a sinful sorrow,
See ver. 9.

For the joy of the Lord is your strength] Or, your fortification, Bernard.
and place of defense against sin, and all the ill fruits of it, Lati igitur
sitis, sed non securis gandeatis in Domino, sed caveatis a recidivo. A merry
heart (grounded upon a good conscience) does good like a medicine, Prove. 17.22.
It is as marrow to the bones, as oil to the wheels, as a bait by the way to a
generous horse: as a back of steel to a bended bow, etc. Surely, as true gold
strengthens the heart, (that Alchymy-gold, does not) so does spiritual joy
much more making a man insuperable under sufferings, and unsatisfiable in
performance of duties. It is such a precious commodity, as that no good can
match it, no evil overmatch it. It bears all things, believes all things,
hops all things, endures all things, as St. Paul says of charity, 1 Cor.
13. ver. 7. And as a man that has plenty of good blood and fresh spirits in
his body, being well-lined within, (as we say) can better endure heat and cold,
etc. then another that has not so: in like sort he that has his heart full of
Heaven, his conscience full of comfort, is in case to do and suffer much for,
and from God and men. The peace of his conscience will appear in his
countenance, as Stevens did: and as the Martyrs in Severus the Emperor his
days, who being released for a time seemed to come e myrotheca, non ergastulo,
out of a perfumed palace, Divinum nescis quid in valtibus ipsis praeferentes,
Eusebius. lib. 5. cap. 12.
and not out of a stinking prison; looking more like Angels of Heaven, then men
on Earth, as in Eusebius relates. The cross to such is anointed, as Bernard
has it: and by the joy of the Lord (that oil of gladness) it is made not only
light, but sweet: not only tolerable, but desirable, and delectable.

Verse 11. So the Levites stilled all the people] Made them hold their tongues,
and forbear their groans, and moanes, the expressions of their great grief
conceived for their sins; making a wayling like the Dragons, mourning as the
owls, and saying, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly, labor not to
comfort me, etc. But these holy Levites did comfort them; Mic. 18. Isai 22.4.
and quiet them.

Saying, Hold your peace] Or, S'^: Peace and be still.

For the day is holy] And God loves not the bread of mourners for a sacrifice;
is like as none might come into the Court of Persia in mourning-weeds, Esth. 4.
ver. 4. See ver. 9.

Neither be ye grieved] It seems, their hearts were even leavened and sowred
with sorrow, as David's was, Psalm. 73.21.

Verse 12. And all the people went their way to eat] To do all that they were
directed to do. They had been in the Furnace of mortification: and now they
were willing to be cast into the mould of Gods Word, and to be whatsoever the
Lord would have them to be. They were only his clay and wax, a willing people,
waiting for his Law.

And to make great mirth] i.e. All kind of honest jollity: for the better
exciting their hearts to true thankfulness.

Because they had understood the words] Not the threatenings only to the
refractary; but the promises also, to the penitent and obedient. The Levites
had taught them, doubtless, (as the truth is in Jesus) that God therefore
threateneth that he may not punish, and desires to be disarmed, Amos. 4.12.
that he gives to do, what he commands to be done, that his mercy is from
everlasting to everlasting to them that fear him, to them that keep his
Covenant, and that think upon his Commandments to do them, qui faciunt
praecepta, etsi non perficiant, that are doing at it, though they are far
from perfection. Psalm. 103.18.
This was very comfortable: this put into them that joy of the Lord which was
their strength: this more cheared them, then all their good cheer of their
peace offerings.

Verse 13. And on the second day] The next day after they had heard the Law
expounded; but were not so well satisfied in some points or cases they follow
on to know the Lord, Hos. 6.3. Divine knowledge is as a great Lady, that will
not easily be acquainted with us, but upon further suit, Prove. 2.3, 4.

Were gathered together, the chief of the Fathers, etc.] Aeneas Sylvius was
wont to say of knowledge, Popular men should esteem it as silver, Noblemen as
gold, Princes prize it as pearls.

The Priests and Levites] These Teachers of others took no scorn to learn of
Ezra that perfect Scribe. The wisest here know but in part: because we
prophecy but in part, 1 Cor. 13. ver. 9. that is, we are taught but
imperfectly, and those that should show us the way, are themselves to seek: to
teach us to run to Ithiel the Arch-prophet, as that great Wiseman did, Prove.
30.1. The greatest part of those things which we know, is the least part of the
things which we know not, as that Father says.

Unto Ezra the Scribe] Who was well instructed to the Kingdom of God; and no
less ready to throw out of his treasury, etc. Matthew. 13.52. It is said of
Tacitus, that he knew all that he should know of the affairs of the World: and
that he was primus in Historia; Scalig.
and that ex ejus ore nil temere excidit. Think the same of Ezra, and much
more: he was an able Teacher of the ablest Teachers, a sacred oracle, a living
library, the argutest and accuratest of men after the Prophets; as Austin is
said to have been after the Apostles, in contemplation, and disputation.

Even to understand the words of the Law] Which he had the day before
expounded: and in some passages whereof they had a desire to be better resolved
and satisfied. No man can possibly speak al at once, or deliver the mind of God
so clearly and fully, but that there may be place left for Cases and Queries.

Verse 14. And they found written in the Law] And therefore in no wise to be
neglected, since there God had written for them great things, Hos. 8.12
Excellent things, Prove. 22.20. mavelous things, Psalm. 119.18. There is a
mountain of sense hangs upon every apex or title of it, say the Rabbines; who
do therefore prescribe to their disciples not to write any Letter of it,
Schi^kard.
but by a Copy; not to read it, but in a clean place; not to touch it, but with
the right hand: not to carry it about him, but next his heart, etc.

That the children of Israel should dwell in Boothes] See Ezra 3.4. with the
Note. For this, the Law was clear, Lev. 23.34. Deuteronomy. 16.13. But this they had
not so fully observed, sc. by dwelling in Boothes, till now that they were
returned from Babylon, where they had been lately, and for a long time,
Strangers. This to profess and set forth, was the intent of that feast, and of
this rite of it, of dwelling in Boothes or Bowers. This is intimated, ver. 1.

Verse 15. And that they should publish and proclaim] Heb. Make a voice to
pass, viz. for better preparation, and greater solemnity. God will not take up
with a careless and slubberd service: he is a great King and stands greatly
upon his seniority, Mal. 1.14.

Go forth unto the m^unt] Which is covered with all sorts of trees: and nothing
like the country Axylus, which is so called, because no trees grow in it, no
not so much as thorns, or any kind of fuel. Live. Lib. 38.
Thorough this country marched Manlius the Roman General, when he went against
the Gallograeci.

And fetch olive-branches, and vine-branches, etc.] Fit for shelter and shadow
against the weather. That is very strange that yet is reported by Authors of
good note, concerning certain trees in Brasile, Abbots Geog. page 271.
of that bigness that whole families live in an arm of one of them, every tree
being as populous, as many of our Villages.

And branches of thick trees] Tied together with willowes of the brook, Levit:
23.40.

Verse: 16. So the people went forth, and brought them] They had kept the feast
of trumpets on the first day of this month. And although no mention be here
made of the Feast of Expiation, a day of Humiliation to be kept for ever upon
the tenth day: yet it is to be presumed, that they kept it, having so good a
guide as Ezra. Now also, as not weary of well-doing, they do most solemnly
celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles, making themselves booths of boughs in
every street thoroughout the whole City.

Verse 17. Made boothes, and sat under the boothes] See Verse 14, 15, 16. They
that turn this history into mystery, make an allusion of it, 1. To Christ as
dwelling in our flesh 2. To Christians as traveling toward heaven, and having
here no settled habitation. Heb. 11.13.

For since the days of Jeshua] Moses is not mentioned; because during his
days, till Joshua brought them into the promised land, they kept not this
feast, likely.

Had not the children of Israel done so] Kept this feast they had, but not so
kept it: viz. with that devotion, solemnity, and great gladness, being in so
poor a case, and yet so unanimous in the work, as one man. But one would wonder
that all along during the reign of David and Solomon (who gave the pattern of,
and built the Temple) and all those succeeding Reformers, there should something
be omitted about the feast of Tabernacles (kept as it is thought by Solomon, 2 Chronicles. 7.8.) till their return from Babylon; yet so it was.

Verse 18. And also day by day] Not only on the first and last day ( that
great day of the feast; John 7.37.) but every day; this good man was at it;
being Insatiabilis Dei cultor, (as Chrysostom says of Saint Paul,) an
insatiable worshipper of God; and accounting quod nimis angusta pietas est; ad
legem, bonum esse; to do nothing for God more then needs must, was too little.

And they kept the feast seven dayes] The people were as willing to hear, (and
do other holy duties) as Ezra was to preach. So were Chrysostomes hearers; who
were wont to say that they could better be without the Sun-light, then
Chrysostomes daily Sermons. So likewise were Calvin's hearers at Geneva, where
he preached every day in the week for most part, and had a constant audience
that even over-admired (some of them at least) his most excellent pains and
parts; as Zanchy shows and complains in the Epistle Dedicatory set before his
Miscellanies: taxing them of (...), man-worship.

And on the eighth day was a solemn assembly] Heb. A restraint, viz. from
servile works: or a Retention, viz. a holding of the Congregation together for
holy uses. Tremellius rendereth it diem interdicti: The vulgar Latin of Lyra
thus, They made a gathering, sc. for necessaries about the Temple. This eight
day thus kept might prefigure the Christian Sabbath, that first day of the week.

CHAP. IX. Verse 1. Now in the twentieth and fourth day]
A Day after the feast of Tabernacles, they keep a solemn fast: Vsque adeo
nihil est, ex omni part; beatum. There is in this present life an interchange
of all things, a succession of feasting and fasting. Of the best, whilst here
it may be said, as Pliny does of Metellus, Infelix dici non debet, felix non
potest: unhappy you cannot call him; happy you may not. Lib. 7. cap. 47.
One compares him to the Arc, which was ever transportative, till settled in
Solomon's Temple: Another to quicksilver, which has in it self a principle of
motion, but not of rest.

The children of Israel were assembled with fasting] As Epaminondas walked
heavily the day after his triumph. Deadness of spirit is apt to follow our
liveliest joys: but that must be looked too, and security prevented, which is
wont to seize upon men after holy duties; like as worms and waspes eat the
sweetest fruits. These fasters had wept at the hearing of the Law, and were
stilled by the Levites, chap. 8.11. because it was unseasonable. Now the feast
being over, and their hearts yet full of grief for their great sin in taking
strange wives, (not yet put away, though they had vowed to do it, Ezra 10.3.
etc.) they first put away those wives on the twenty third day, and then humble
themselves by fasting and prayer on this twenty fourth day; being wrought
thereunto by the reading of the Law, as is employed in the next verse.

And with sackcloth] As acknowledging themselves unworthy of the coursest
clothing: and that, but for shame, they would have stripped themselves naked.

And earth upon them] As those that had forfeited all, and deserved to be as
far under ground, as now they were above.

Verse 2. And the seed of Israel] Called Israelites, (not Abrahamites) from
their wrestling with God by prayer and tears, and prevailing. Called also
Jews from Judah, which signifies the Confessor. Here it is said of them that.

They stood and confessed their sinnes] All their sins either actually
committed, or habitually comprised in their body of sin. This whosoever does in
due manner shall have mercy, Prove. 28.13. Yea, he shall have heaven. Israel had
power with God as a Prince. Judah the Confessor got the Kingdom from Reuben.
Confession is the way to the Kingdom, walk in it: Only it must be joined with
confusion of sin, as here. They separated themselves from all strangers, they
abandoned their peccatum in aleiciis, their darling sin, they kept themselves
from their iniquity, Martial.
Psalm. 18.23. Hoc non fit verbis, Marce: ut ameris, ama.

And the sins of their fathers] i. e. Of their Progenitors: which are owned,
if not bewailed, disclaimed.

Verse 3. And they stood up in their place] The people stood for reverence-sake
to the Word read (see chap. 8.5.) Or the Ministers stood up in their Pulpits,
where they represent God himself as his Ambassadors; and should therefore lay
down all self-respects and aims at the Pulpit door; Oecolamp.
and be fully of his mind, who said, I would not be found speaking or doing
ought that I thought Christ would not approve of, if he were corporally present.

And read in the book] Giving the sense of that they read; and applying it
close to men's consciences. This was preaching indeed: for as every sound is not
music; so neither is every Pulpit-discourse, Preaching. Cura Pastoralis est
ars artium and scientia scientiarum, says one, It is a matter of great skill
to divide the word aright. See chap. 8.8.

One fourth part of the day] i. e. for three hours: from nine a clock to
twelve. This warranteth our preaching Fast-Sermons; though prayer be the chief
business of such a day. See Jer. 36.6, 7.

And another fourth part] Sc. From twelve to three: thus besides the ordinary
morning and evening sacrifices, they divided the day betwixt Preaching and
Prayer, as those did, Acts 6.4. And as the Priests of old taught Jacob Gods
judgments, and put incense before the Lord, Deuteronomy. 33.10. The Jews at this day
boast that they divide the day (even the working-day) into three parts: the
first ad Tephillah they spend in Prayer; the second ad Torah, in reading the
Law; the third ad Malachah, in their worldly business. But you are not bound
herein to believe them.

They confessed] Not without supplication for pardon, and power to do better.

And worshipped the Lord their God] Inwardly and outwardly, giving him his due
glory, and resting upon him by a lively faith in the gracious promises: being
fully persuaded of this, that together with the forgiveness of sin they
should have those particular blessings which they sued for, so far as might
stand with Gods glory, and the good of their souls.

Verse 4. Then stood up] Each of these eight in his turn, or each in his own
proper place: the people being, for more conveniency-sake, divided into eight
several Congregations.

And cried with a loud voyce] Verbis non modo disertis, sed and exsertis, that
God might hear (which yet he can do very well without any audible voice, Exodus
14.15. 1 Kings 22.32.) and all the people might hear, and join in prayer.

Unto the Lord their God] As being in Covenant with them. This shows their
faith, as the former their fervencie. Faith is the foundation of Prayer: and
Prayer is the fervencie of Faith.

Verse 5. (...). 2 Timothy 4.2.
Then the Levites, Jeshua, etc. said, stand up] Gird your selves, and serve the
Lord, as Luke 17.8. Be instant, or stand close to the work; set sides and
shoulders to it, Rouse up your selves, Neand. Chron page 74.
and wrestle with God. Hoc agite, said the Roman Priest to the people at their
sacrifices. And Sacerdos parat fratrum mentes dicendo, Sursum corda, says
Cyprian, In the Primitive times the Ministers prepared the people to serve God,
by saying, Lift up your hearts. De oratione.


And bless the Lord your God for ever] Give him immortal thanks, all possible
praise, amore, more, ore, glorify him doingly, 1 Cor. 10.30, 31. Ephesians. 1.11,
12. Think of the multitude, seasonablenesse, suitableness, constancy, etc. of
Gods favors: and then give him the glory due unto his Name; which yet we can
never do, because his Name is exalted above all blessing and praise (as it
follows here) so that if we should do nothing else all our days, yea as long
as the days of heaven shall last (said that Martyr) but kneel upon our knees
and sing over David's Psalms to Gods praise, yet should we fall far short fo
what we owe to the Lord, who is most worthy to be praised.

And blessed be thy glorious name] These holy Levites having called upon the
people to bless God, break forth into the performance of this Divine duty
themselves. So Saint Paul often exhorting the Saints to pray, falls a praying
for them.

Which is exalted above all blessing and praise] So that when we have done our
utmost herein, we can never over-do. David is often so transported, that he
seems to forget himself, as a bird that has got note, records it over and
over, as Psalm. 136. for his mercy endures for ever. And Psalm. 150. in six
verses are twelve Halleluiahs. Praise him (says He Verse 2.) according to his
excellent greatness (for great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, Psalm.
145.3.) and verse 6. Let every thing that has breath, praise the Lord, Or, Let
every breath praise the Lord. As often as we breath, we are to breath out the
praises of God; and to make our breath like the perfumed smoke of the
Tabernacle.

Verse 6. Thou, even thou art Lord alone] Jehovah is Gods incommunicable name:
that holy and reverend Name of his which Jews pronounce not, we too often
profane, at least by not considering the import of it; which is enough to
answer all our doubts, and to fill us with strong consolation, had we but skill
to spell all the letters in it.

Thou have made heaven] With great skill and artifice thou have made it, three
stories high, 2 Cor. 12.2. Heb. 11.10.

The heaven of heavens] Called the highest, Luke 2.14. and the third heaven, 2
Cor. 12.2. Of this heaven no natural knowledge can be had, nor any help by
humane arts, Geometry, Optics, etc. for it is neither aspectable, nor movable.

With all their host] i. e. Their furniture; Angels, those heavenly Courtiers,
Sun, Moon and Stars, etc. which are all Gods servants, Psalm. 119.91. and
do, in their way, worship Him.

The earth and all things that are therein] God may be read in the great book
of Nature, which has three leaves, Heaven, Earth, and Sea. Heaven is all
that is above earth: Earth is an element of cold and dry nature, thick, solid,
heavy, placed in the midst of the world as the foundation thereof, and
therefore unmovable, though round (and in that respect naturally apt for
motion) and though founded, not upon solid rocks, but fluid waters. This,
Aristotle himself wondered at, Lib. 2. de Coelo, cap. 13.

And all things that are thereon] Either therein, as metals and minerals; or
thereon, as men, beasts, creeping things, etc.

The Seas and all that are therein] As, There is that Leviathan, and creeping
things innumerable: Gods handiwork all of them.

And thou preservest them all] Give them (...), Acts 17.25. life and breath,
motion and maintenance; thou upholdest the whole creation by the word of thy
power, Heb. 1.3.
and all things subsist by thy manutension. God does not cast off the care of
his works that he has made (as does the Carpenter, or Shipwright) but being
perpetually present with them, rules, disposes and orders all by a certain
counsel, to his own ends, and at length to his own glory.

And the host of heaven worshippeth thee] Angels, and Saints especially: who
the more they know of God, the more they love him and honor him; making their
addresses to him with greatest self-abasement, considering their distance, and
disproportion. Thus Angels: As for Saints; All thy works praise thee, O God,
says David, that is, they give matter and occasion; but thy Saints bless
thee, Psalm. 145.10. How they do this, see Rev. 5.11, 12.

Verse 7. Thou art the Lord the God] Heb. That Lord, with an emphasis, with an
accent; and besides thee there is none other. See verse 6. This is proved by
his free favors to Israel, and patient bearing with their evil manners in the
wilderness; there being not any God like unto our God, for pardoning of sin,
and passing by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage, Mic. 7.18.

And did choose Abram] God first chose him for his love, and then loved him
for his choice.

And broughtst him out of Vr of the Chaldees] Pulling him as a brand out of
that fire, where, till then, he had lived (and might else have died) an
Idolater, Josh. 24.2.

And gave him the name of Abraham] See the Note on Genesis 17.5.

Verse 8. And foundest his heart faithful] He must needs find it so, who had
made it so. Otherwise Abraham, as well as any other, might well say, Bern.
Horreo quicquid de meo est, ut meus sim. The natural heart is deceitful and
desperately wicked, etc. a bundle of sin (folly is bound up, etc.) a treasury
of sin (an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart, etc.) a raging Sea
of sin, Esaias 57.20. a world of wickedness, James 3.6. If any good be in it,
it is but as a drop of rose water in a bowl of poison; where falling, it is
presently corrupted.

And made a Covenant with him] To be his God, and the God of his seed. This
was divini mellis alveare, the bee-hive of heavenly honey: this was more then
to be made Monarch of the whole world. See Genesis 17.20, 21.

To give the land of the Canaanites, etc.] Who had filled that good land from
one end to the other with their uncleanness, Ezra 9.11. and were therefore
worthily rooted out of it. So Josephus reports that in his time these Jews
were grown so wicked, that if the Romans had not destroyed them, without doubt
either the earth would have swallowed them up, or fire from heaven have
consumed them. Bid says of the ancient Britains (immediately before their
destruction by the Saxons) that they were come to a very great height of
wickedness: so as to shame the counsel of the poor, because the Lord was his
refuge, Psalm. 14.6.

And have performed thy words] Of many promisers it may be said, as Tertullian
of the Peacock, all in changeable colors; as often changed as moved. Sertorius
paid his promises with fair words. Antiochus was surnamed Doson, because he often
said I will give you this, or that, but never did. God is none such.

For thou art righteous] That is, faithful: for there is a twofold justice of
God. 1. Of Equity. 2. Of Fidelity. See 1 John 1.9. Rev. 10.1. Where Christ is
said to have a rainbow on his head; to show that he is faithful and constant in
his promises.

Verse 9 And did see the affliction] The eyes of the Lord are upon the
righteous, as well as his ears open to their prayers: he knows their soul in
adversity, and de remedio prospicit, he is solicitous of their safety.

And heardest their cry by the red sea] Though mixed with much murmuring, Exodus
14.10. So he heard that pitiful poor prayer of David, Psalm. 31.22. I said in
mine haste, I am cut off from thine eyes: Nevertheless thou heardst the voice
of my supplications, when I I cried unto thee. God hears the young Ravens,
Psalm. 147.9. though they have but an hoarse and harsh note, make no melody to
move pity, and cry but by implication only, and not directly unto him.

Verse 10. And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh] That sturdy Rebel,
whom neither Ministry, nor misery, nor miracle, nor mercy could possibly
mollify. This was worse then any or all those ten plagues sent upon him,
whereof see Exodus 3.19. with the Note.

For thou knew that they dealt proudly, etc.] This the just and jealous God
could not away with, Exodus 18.11. His work in Heaven is (said that Heathen) to
cast down the lofty, (...), etc. Aesop. Chiloni.
and to lift up the lowly.

So did thou get thee a name] i. e. A great fame of thy power and justice, to
the conversion of some (as Jethro, Exodus 18.1.) and conviction of others, as
Deuteronomy. 32.31. Josh. 2.10. 1 Samuel 4.8.

Verse 11. And thou did divide the Sea before them] That which threatened to
swallow them, preserved them. For this, shall every one that is godly pray unto
thee in a time when thou may be found: surely in the floods of great waters
they shall not come nigh unto him, Psalm. 32.6.

As a stone into the mighty waters] As lead, Exodus 15.10. So shall Rome (that
spiritual Egypt) once sink into the bottom of the Sea, as a millstone thrust
into it by a mighty Angel, with a most impetuous force, Rev. 18.21.

Verse 12. Moreover thou leddest them by day, etc.] This pillar of a cloud was
miraculously moved with such variation as God thought fit, for the guiding of
their journeyes: much better then did or could Vibilia that Heathen-fiction.

And in the night by a pillar of fire] Though they did not usually journey in
the night, yet sometimes they did; and then this pillar of fire was their
guide. God is with his at all assayes; and is all in all unto them, Psalm.
121.4. See Esaias 4.5, 6.

Verse 13. Thou came down also upon mount Sinai] A place of many bushes and
briers: The Law there delivered, pricketh and pierces the consciences of
evildoers. Thither God came with ten thousands of his Saints, as Moses (who
climbed up that hill, and alone saw it) says, Deuteronomy. 33.2.

And spakest with them from heaven] He came down upon Sinai, and yet spoke from
heaven: See a like text, John 3.13. There he spoke also with us, Hos. 12.4. See
that ye refuse not him that speaks from heaven, see that ye shift him not
off, much less turn away from him, Heb. 12.25.

And gave them right judgments, etc.] All these high praises are far below
the worth and excellency of Gods holy Laws. They were given in the
wilderness, because (says Philo) they are to be learnt in a wilderness;
seeing there we cannot be hindered by the multitude. But this is no way solid,
as one has well observed.

Good Statutes and Commmandments] Good they are in respect, 1. Of the Author.
2. Of the Matter. 3. Of the Effect; for they make those good that observe them.
This is true of the Moral Law; as for the Judicial, it was fitted to the Jews,
and best for them: but Carolostadius did ill to seek to force it as needful for
all Christian Commonwealths. Encyclop.
Solon being asked whether he had given the best Laws to the Athenians?
answered, the best for them, the best that they could suffer. So here.

Verse 14. And made known unto them thy holy Sabbath.] Not then first known
to the Church: but of old observed, even from the beginning, Genesis 2.3. about
2544. years before it was made known in such a solemn sort at Sinai; as having
been much neglected and forgotten, during the Egyptian servitude. So it was by
the German Churches, till God awakened them by the loss of Prague (that first
blow given them) and that upon the Sabbath day, which they kept no otherwise
then if it had been Dies daemoniacus, and not dominicus, (as their countryman
Alsted complains) and as if it had been called Sabbath from Sabbos a name of
Bacchus, as Plutarch dreamed.

And commandedst them precepts] See the Note on verse 13.

Verse 15. And gave them bread from heaven] Pluviam escatilem, and petrum
aquatilem, as Tertullian phraseth it. God rained down Angels food, and set the
flint a broach; and this he did for their hunger, for their thirst, fitting his
favors ad cardinem desiderii, according to their need, and request. Besides
that, their bread was sacramental, whereof they communicated every day. Their
drink also was sacramental, that this ancient Church might give no warrant of a
dry Communion: for they did all eat of the same spiritual meat, and did all
drink the same spiritual drink, the same that we do at the Lords Supper, 1 Cor.
10.3, 4.

And promisedst them that they should go in, etc.] And the like promise he has
made of heaven to all his people. Let us therefore fear, etc. Heb. 4.1. Let us
therefore cleanse our selves, etc. 2 Cor. 6.1. Let us haste away in our
affections, Col. 3.2.

Which thou have sworne] So he has to give us heaven, (because he knows how
backward we are to believe him, without such a pawn) that by two immutable
things, Gods Word, and Gods Oath (which makes his Word not more true, but yet
more credible) we might have strong consolation, Heb. 6.18. and more abundant
entrance into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 2
Pet. 1.11.

Verse 16. But they and our fathers] Gods mercies have been hitherto mentioned,
that their sins might thereby be aggravated: For good turns aggravate
unkindnesses; and men's sins are much increased by their obligations. It is
charged upon Solomon as a foul fault, that he departed from the Lord, who had
appeared unto him twice, 1 Kings 11.9.

Dealt proudly] Pride is the Master-pock of the soul, and the root of rebellion
against God, Psalm. 119.21.

And hardened their necks] As unruly beasts that will not bear the yoke;
lawless and awlesse persons that refuse to be reformed, hate to be healed.

And hearkened not to thy Commandments] But rather to the Devils whistle,
calling them off from better practices.

Verse 17. And refused to obey] Heb, To hearken. They not only not hearkened,
but refused to hear reasons why they should; as having made their conclusion,
and being as good as ever they meant to be. This is to add rebellion to sin:
this is that stubbornness that Ahaz is taxed of and branded for, 2 Chronicles.
28.25.

Neither were mindful of the wonders] These soon grew stale to them, as the
Psalmist proves by their wicked practices, Psalm. 106.13. And truly who that
looks upon our lives, would ever think that God had done any wonders for us
of this Nation, either by sea or land, either against fireworks or waterworks
formerly; or against a viperous brood amongst our selves, here alate? Number. 14.4.


And in their rebellion appointed a Captaine] They once talked (in their mad
mood) of doing such a thing, and therefore they are here said to have done it:
Like as Josh. 24.9. it is said that Balac arose and fought with Israel; and yet
the story says no such matter. But if he did not, yet because he thought and
talked of such a matter; it was a done thing before the Lord!

But thou art a God ready to pardon] Heb. A God of pardons. One that have set
up a pardon-office; where pardons for penitents lie ready sealed, that the
sinner may not be to seek, that he may not perish in his sins while the
plaster is in providing. It is our comfort that we have to do with a
forgiving, sinne-pardoning God, that does it naturally, Exodus 34.6.
plentifully, Is. 55.7. constantly, Ps. 130.4. This should be as a perpetual
picture in our hearts.

Gracious] Doing all for us gratis, and ex mero motu; out of his free and
unexcited love.

And merciful] All-bowels; whereby he is inclined to succor them that are in
misery, notwithstanding their sins. See his Non-obstante, Psalm. 106.8.

Long-suffering] Heb. Long of anger, that is, Long ere he will be angry; not
hasty of spirit, as Prove. 14.17, 29. but wondrous patient, amidst a world of
provocations.

And of great kindnesse] Exceeding propense to communicate good. The Hebrew
word signifies a large quantity either continued (that is, magnitude or
greatness) Psalm. 48.2. Or discrete (that is, multitude) Psalm. 3.1, 2.

And forsookest them not] That is, not utterly, as David prays, Psalm. 119.8.
and after him Solomon, 1 Kings 8.57. When God forsakes a people or person, woe
be to them, Hos. 9.12. What a terrible text is that, Ezekiel. 22.20. I will gather
you in mine anger, and my fury, and I will leave you there? and that other,
Jer. 16.13. I will cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not --
where I will not show you favor? This last was worse then all the rest. This
the Prophet well knew; and therefore cried out, Lord leave us not, Jer. 17.17.

Extingui lucem ne patiare tuam. Or if thou desert us for a time, yet do not
disinherit us for ever. If thy dereliction of us be penal, M^s. Gerundin
yet let it not be Perpetual.

Verse 18. Yea when they had made them a Golden Calf] An ounce whereof the Jews
say is still to this day in all the punishments that befall them: though some
of their Rabbines have the face to excuse this gross Idolatry of their
forefathers. See Act. 7.41. (...), Piscat.
Vitulificarunt.

And said, this is thy God] Exodus 32.4. These be thy Gods. It was the Serpents
Grammar that first taught men to decline God in the plural number: Ye shall be
as Gods, Genesis 3.

That brought thee out of the Land of Egypt] Some of them then did mean to
worship the true God, in this false manner: hence Exodus 32.5. there is
proclaimed a feast (not to the Golden Calf, but) to Jehovah. Here then falls to
the ground the Papists plea for their image worship.

And had wrought great provocations] Or, Blasphemies, 2 King. 19.3. Idolatry is
no better. Hierome as often as he meets with this Hebrew word in the book of
Psalms (and that is five several times) he translateth it, to balspheme.

Verse 19. Yet thou in thy manifold mercies] Nothing else could have kept him
from turning them off, and saying to them as once Jephta did, Judge. 11. Behold
ye have thrust me out: and do ye come unto me in your distress? Go, cry unto
the Gods which ye have chosen: Let them deliver you in the time of your
Tribulation, Judge. 10.

Forsookest them not in the Wildernesse] And yet he was near the matter, when
he would own them no longer, but even fathered them upon Moses, saying, Exodus
32.7. Thy people which thou broughtest out of the Land of Egypt, have corrupted
themselves.

The pillar of cloud departed not] It is sad with a people when God sends for
his Love Tokens (his Ordinances) when they have sinned away their light; and so
wiped off all their comfortables.

Verse 20. Thou gave also thy good Spirit] Viz. to their Governors and
teachers, Numb. 11.16, 17, 25, 26. Yea to every good soul, that they might be
all taught of God, led into all truth and holiness, Joel 2.28.
Ephesians. 5.9. For which end God has promised to pour his Spirit upon all flesh,
that is, the best thing upon the basest. Next to the sending of his Son in the
flesh (which is called the gift Joh. 4.10. and the benefit 1 Timothy 6.2.) what
can God do more for his people then to give them his good spirit? this is to
give them all good things in one, Mat. 7.11. with Luke 11.13.

And withheldest not thy Manna] See verse 15. It is twice mentioned as a
singular and signal mercy. And it is well observed by a Reverend Writer, that
this Manna and water from the Rock, (which was Christ in the Gospel) were given
this people before the Law, the Sacraments of grace before the legal Covenant.
The Grace of God preventeth our obedience: Therefore shall we keep the Law of
God, because we have a Savior.

Verse 21. Yea forty years did thou sustain them] Sustain them? this is a
mere Miosis, since never was Prince so served in his greatest Pomp, as these
rebellious Israelites were in the wilderness: They had their Quails and their
Manna, and the Rock to follow them, etc.

So that they lacked nothing] No more shall they that seek the Lord lack any
good thing, Psalm. 34.10, and 84.11. God will not be a wilderness to them, or a
land of darkness, Jer. 2.31. A sufficiency they shall be sure of, if not a
superfluity: yea in the midst of straits they shall be in a sufficiency, 1 Timothy
6.6. The ungodly are not so, Job 20.22.

Their cloths waxed not old] They wore not in the wearing; this was wonderful:
these men lived in an age of miracles; here was no need of What shall we put
on? For the cloths they had of their own, and that they borrowed of the
Egyptians decayed not; but, as some think, grew up with their persons. See
Deuteronomy. 8.4. and 29.5.

And their feet swelled not] Nor did any other disease annoy them, while they
were in the wilderness, There was not one feeble person among them: this was a
sweet mercy. Non est vivere, sed valere, vita; si vales, been est. Vincentio
Pestiom an Italian Gentleman being asked how old he was? answered that he was
in health. And to another that asked how rich he was? answered, that he was not
in debt. This was the happiness of these Israelites in the wilderness.

Verse 22. Moreover, thou gave them Kingdoms and Nations] God gave them all;
for he is the true proprietary, he pulls down one, and sets up another.
This, Nebuchadnezzar acknowledged (after he had been turned a grazing,) and
Charles the Fifth, Emperor of Germany, who in twenty eight battles in America
waged by Cortez and Pizarro won eight and twenty Kingdoms. Prideaux. Introduct.
And what a world of Nations are swallowed up in the greatness of the Turkish
Empire? America has the happiness to be out of their reach.

So they possessed the land of Sihon] Gods favors must not be mentioned in the
lump only, and by wholesale; but particularly enumerated and celebrated.

Verse 23. Their children also multipliedst thou] Judaea was not above two
hundred miles long, and fifty miles broad (not near the half of England by
much,) yet what a numerous people were they? what huge armies had they?

And broughtest them into the land] Not the nearest way, but the best for them;
that he might humble them, and try them, and do them good in the latter end. If
God will bring us to heaven at length, (as Israel in the wilderness, so) must
we follow him and the line of his Law, though it seem to lead us in and out,
backward and forward, as if we were treading a maze.

Concerning which thou had promised to their fathers] And they disposed of it
by Will to their posterity, as if they had been in present possession. Gods
promises are good sure-hold: the Patriarchs would be buried there, though they
died in Egypt, and keep possession, as they could: for they knew that all was
their own.

Verse 24. So the children went in] After that they had been held a long while
under the Egyptian servitude. God knows how to commend his favors to us, which
cito data cito vilescunt, lightly come by, are lightly set by.

And thou subduedst before them -- the Canaanites] There is an elegancy in the
original, Thou bowedst or pressedst down those crookened or depressed ones, the
Canaanites who had their very name (portending their condition) from bowing
down, as born to be servants of servants, according to Noah's curse, Genesis 9.25.
with Romans 11.16.

And gave them into their hand] If any were unsubdued, it was through their
own sloth, for which they are reproved, and by which they afterward smarted.
It is the observation of a good Divine, that as seven Tribes are justly taxed
by Joshua for their negligence and sloth in not seeking speedily to possess
the land God had offered them, Josh. 18.2. so may the most of us be justly
rebuked for grievous security about the heavenly Canaan. Diverse of the better
sort have but a title: and therefore it justly falls out, that these are
buffeted by Christ, as those were disgraced by Joshua.

That they might do with them as they would] Save or slay whom they pleased;
yet not forgetting the Laws of humanity; as the bloody Spaniards have done
amongst the miserable Indians: causing them to cry out, that it had been far
better, that the Indies had been given to the Devils of hell then to them, and
that if the Spaniards go to heaven when they die, themselves will never come
there, though they might.

Verse 25. And they took strong Cities] With no great ado: like as towns were
said to come in to Timotheus (the Athenian-Generall) his toiles while he slept.
Plut. in Sylla.
This he ascribed to his own prowess and policy: often interlacing this proud
speech (Herein Fortune had no part) and from thenceforth never prospered, in
any thing he undertook.

And a fat land] Flowing with plenty of dainties; though Strabo spitefully
slander it for craggy and barren.

And possessed houses full of all goods] Of all pleasant and precious
substance: for the Canaanites were great Merchants, Esaias 23.8. Hos. 12.7. Ezekiel.
17.4.

Wells digged] A great commodity in that hot Country.

Vine-yards and Olive-yards] A singular help to housekeeping.

So they did eat and were filled] They had enough of every thing; and did eat
whiles eating was good, as they say Queen Elizabeth did seldom eat but of one
dish, rose ever with an appetite, and lived about seventy years. King Edward
the sixth was wont to call her His sweet sister Temperance.

And delighted themselves in thy great goodnesse] They lived in Gods good land;
but not by Gods good Laws; the refreshing they found by his best creatures was
none other but such as his, who warmeth himself, and says, Aha, I am warm, I
have seen the fire, Isa. 44.16.

Verse 26. Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled] See how full in
the mouth these holy Levites were in aggravating their own and their
forefathers sins, which swelled as so many toads in their eyes; neither could
they ever sufficiently disgrace them. This is the property and practice of the
true penitentiary.

They cast thy Law behind their backs] That is, they vilipended and
undervalued it; God drew them by the cords of a man, (so the cords of kindness
are called, Hos. 11.4. because befitting the nature of a man, and likeliest to
prevail with rational people) but they like men (or rather like beasts)
transgressed the Covenant: and, as if God had even hired them to be wicked, so
did they abuse all his benefits to his greatest dishonor; being therefore the
worse, because in reason, they ought to have been better.

And slew thy Prophets which testified against them to turn to thee] This was
the worst they did to them, and that for which they received mercedem mundi,
the wages of the mad world ever beside it self in point of salvation, and
falling foul upon such as seek its good. This is that sin that brings ruin
without remedy, 2 Chronicles. 36.16. Prove. 29.1. for, precious in the sight of the
Lord is the death of his Saints, Psalm. 116.

And they wrought great provocations] Or, Blasphemies: see verse 18.

Verse 27. Therefore thou deliveredst them] Flagitium and flagellum, sicut acus
and filum. Sin and punishment are tied together with chains of adamant.

Who vexed them] Heb. Put them to straits; so that they had not what shift to
make, or how to help themselves.

And in the time of their trouble] Vexatio dedit intellectum. The time of
affliction is the time of supplication. When out of the depths Gods people cry
unto him, they may have any thing, Zach. 13.9. speedy audience, unmiscarrying
returns of their prayers.

Thou gave them Saviours] i. e. Deliverers such as the Judges were, Judge.
3.9. and such as Flaminius the Roman was to the poor Argives; who therefore
called him Savior Savior, and that with such a courage, Plut. in Flam
ut corvi fortuito superv^lantes, in stadium deciderent, that the birds fell to
the earth amazed with that outcry; the air was so dissipated with their
acclamations.

Verse 28. But after they had rest, they did evil again] As standing pooles
breed vermin; as sedentary lives are subject to diseases. If men be not poured
out from vessel to vessel, they will soon settle upon their ^ees. Because they
have no changes, therefore they fear not God, Psalm. 55.19. says David, of the
wicked: and Psalm. 30. David himself was afflicted, delivered, and then grew
wanton. Then troubled again; verse 7. cries again, verse 8.9. God turns his
mourning to joy again; whereof if he surfeited not, it was well bestowed on
him. But rarae fumant felicibus arae. We are commonly best when worst: and
Pliny told his friend, Plin. Epist.
that the best way to live well, was to be as good in health, as we promise to
be when we are sick.

Therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies] Who can do us no
hurt, but by Divine permission; though they bandy together, and bend all their
forces to harm the Church, yet are they bounded by God, and can do nothing,
till he leave his people in their hands.

Had the dominion over them] Ruled them with rigor.

And many times did thou deliver them] Even toties quoties: for as the eye is
not wearied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing: so neither is God with
showing mercy. But as the Sun shines after it has shone, and as the spring
runs after it has run; so does the Lord proceed to do good to his in their
necessity; and that according to his mercies which never fail, Lam. 3.22.

Verse 29. And testifiedst against them] Toldest them of their sins,
foretoldest them of their dangers, did all that could be done to do them
good: but nothing would do.

Yet they dealt proudly] See verse 16.

And hearkened not] Intus existens prohibuit alienum; Hear, and give ear, be
not proud, Jer. 13.15.

But sinned against thy judgements] i. e. Thy Statutes, though made with so
much reason and respect to our good, that if God did not command them, yet were
it every way our best way to practice them, Esaias 48.17. I am the Lord thy God
which teaches thee to profit, which leads thee by the way which thou
should go. As who should say, It is for thy profit that I command thee this
or that, and not for mine own.

Which if a man do] But that, as now, he cannot do, and therefore not be saved
by the Law, Romans 10.5. Our Savior indeed said to that young justiciary, This
do and thou shall live, Luke 10.28. But that was all one, says Luther, as if
Christ had said unto him, Vade and morere, Go upon thy death; for do this of
thy self, and live thereby thou art never able.

And withdrew the shoulder] When called to take up Christ's yoke, or to bear
his cross. See the Note on Zach. 7.11.

And hardened their necks] To sinews of iron, they added brows of brass.

Verse 30. Yet many years did thou forbear them] Heb. Protract over them: or
draw out thy loving kindness toward them, to the utmost.

And testifiedst against them] As verse 29. They wanted not for warnings or
wooings, with, Woe unto thee O Jerusalem: will thou not be made clean? when
shall it once be?

Yet would they not hear] But as Sea Monsters, or Catadupes, or men borne in a
mill, or as one that is running a race; give him never so good counsel, he
cannot stay to hear it.

Therefore gave thou them] As uncounselable, incorrigible.

Verse 31. Nevertheless for thy great mercies sake] Man's perverseness cannot
interrupt the course of Gods goodness. In the midst of judgment, he
remembers mercy, which bears the same proportion to his judgment, which
seven (a complete number) has to an Unity.

Thou did not utterly consume them] God will repent for his people, when he
sees their power is gone, Deuteronomy. 32.36. and be jealous with a great jealousy,
when the enemy goes beyond his commission, Zach. 1.14, 15.

For thou art a gracious and merciful God] And this is most seen, when misery
weighs down, and nothing but mercy turns the scale.

Verse 32. Now therefore our God, the great, the mighty] It is an high point of
heavenly wisdom, in the beginning of our petitions, to propound God to our
selves under such holy notions and fit expressions, as wherein we may see an
answer to our prayers, as here. See chap. 1.5.

Let not all the trouble] Heb. The wearying, the lassitude. Afflictions are not
joyous, but grievous to the flesh, which does soon flag, and even sink under
the burden, if not supported by the hand of heaven.

Seem little before thee] As if we had not yet suffered enough, but (as if we
wanted weight) must be made yet heavier by an addition of new afflictions, 1
Pet. 1.6. God is apt to think a little enough, and spare, Esaias 40.1. and to
take care that the spirit fail not before him, that his children swoon not in
the whipping, Esaias 57.16. He knows that every child of affliction has not the
strength to cry out as Luther did, Feri Domine, feri, smite on, Lord, smite on,
for I am absolved from my sins: or as another did, I thank thee O Lord, for
all mine extremity: and I beseech thee, if thou think good, to add to it an
hundred fold more etc.

That has come upon us] As foul-weather comes before it is sent for. Heb. Has
found us; for we sought it not, but would gladly have shunned it.

Since the times of the Kings of Assyria] Who yet were their most favorable
enemies; and are therefore compared to a golden head in Nebuchadnezzars Image:
but any servitude is grievous: and among the Greeks, after that they were
delivered from the tyranny of the Macedonians and Spartans, the Crier at the
Namaean games was forced to pronounce the word Liberty iterumque iterumque,
again and again. And how earnest are Gods people here in deprecating another
captivity. He hears them; and for their late seventy years captivity,
grants them seven seventies of years ( Daniels weeks) for the enjoyment of
their own country.

Verse 33. Howbeit thou art just] So Mauricius the Emperor justified God, when
he saw his wife and children butchered before his eyes by the traitor Phocas,
and knew that himself should be soon after stewed in his own broth; he cried
out, just art thou O Lord, and just are all thy judgments. So did the Noble Du
Plessy, when he heard of the death of his only son slain in Holland; which
so grieved his mother, that soon after she died.

Verse 34. Neither have our Kings, our Princes, our Priests, etc.] But as there
has been a general defection, so a well deserved desolation, wherein we have
all justly shared.

Nor hearkened to thy Commandments] And that because they testified against
their contrary practices. This, wicked men cannot away with, they hate him that
reproves in the gate, as Ahab did Micaiah. None but the gracious can say, Let
the righteous smite me, be the reproof never so well tempered. No sugar can
bereave a pill of its bitterness. Now the ear tries words, as the mouth
tastes meats, Job. 12.11. And ungodly men (as they write of some creatures)
have fell in aure, and must get their ears cured ere they can be in case to
hear Gods Commandments, and his Testimonies. In vita.
It is said of Gerson, that he loved a friendly reprover: and of Queen Anne
Bullen, that she not only was willing to be admonished, Her life by M. Clark.
but also required her Chaplains freely and plainly to tell her of whatsoever
was amiss. Scilicet Christus voluit aliquando etiam Reginam in Coelum vehere,
as Luther once said of Elizabeth, Queen of Denmark. These Kings and Princes of
Israel were nonesuch.

Verse 35. For they have not served thee in their Kingdom] As David did, who
held it his highest honor to be the servant of the Lord: and as those three
famous Christian Emperors, Constantine, Valentinian, Psalm. 36. Socrat.
and Theodosius, who styled themselves The vassailes of Jesus Christ.

And in thy great goodness that thou gave them] In the abundance of all
things, Deuteronomy. 28.47. they should have considered, The more wages, the more
work: and that thus to requite the Lord, was to come under the censure of a
foolish people and unwise, Deuteronomy. 32.6. yea, of idle and evil servants, Mat.
25.26.

And in the large and fat land] But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked: fullness
bred forgetfulness, saturity, security, Deuteronomy. 32.15. therefore he was worthily
pent up and pined in a strange land; where he had liberty little enough, and
prisoners pittance.

Neither turned they from their wicked works] They quarrel not with their
faults, but with their friends that reprove them; they turn not to him from
whom they had deeply revolted. Their impenitency makes their sins mortal,
says Saint John, 1 Epist. 5.16. immortal, says Saint Paul, Romans 2.5. they die
in their sins, as did those Jews in the Gospel, and perish for ever, John
8.21.

Verse 36. Behold, we are servants this day] This is twice here bewailed, as a
singular unhappiness. They that live under the Turkish slavery, feel it so.
Poor Greece that was once Sol and sal gentium, terrarum flos, and fons
literarum, is now -- vel Priamo miseranda manus. Princess of Nations, Queen of
Provinces
She was, that now thus tributary is.
Lam. 1.1. Out of Greece, and other Countries that had sometimes received the
Faith of Christ, the Turkish tyrants draw with them to the wars great
multitudes of wretched people, whom they call Asape. These carry all the
baggage; these carry wood and water for other soldiers of better account:
these serve instead of Pioners to cast up trenches, and raise bulwarks: and
when battle is to be given, if it be in plain field, these have then weapons
put into their hands, and are thrust into the forefront of the battle, to
blunt the enemies swords: But if a City be to be besieged, these serve as fit
matter to fill the ditches with their dead bodies, Turk. Hist. 325. and 317.
or to make bridges for other soldiers to pass over upon. And if they shrink
to attempt any thing they are commanded, then are they more cruelly used by
their Commanders, then by their enemies. And this the Ottoman Kings count good
policy.

Verse 37. And it yields much increase unto the Kings] As this Land once did
unto the King of Locusts. When it was styled the Popes hortus deliciarum; out
of which he could fetch what money, or any thing else he pleased, so long as he
could hold a pen in his hand. In the year 720. Ino King of West Saxons, caused
in all his Dominion, Act. and Mon.
in every house having a chimney, a penny to be collected and paid to the
Bishop of Rome, in the name of Saint Peter; and thereof were they called
Peter Pence. These continued till Henry the eighth's time: who in his
Protestation against the Pope, speaks thus; England is no more a babe: there
is no man here, but now he knows that they do foolishly, that give gold for
lead, more weight of that then they receive of this, etc. Ibid. 990.


Also they have dominion] See the Note on verse 30.

At their pleasure] Their will was a law; which to argue or debate, was high
misdemeanour; to detrect or disobey, present death.

Verse 38. And because of all this] Our sin and misery.

We make a sure Covenant] See Ezra 10.3.

And write it] Litera scripta manet.

And our Princes, Levites and Priests seal unto it] In the room and name of
all the rest, who have sworn and will perform it, that we will keep thy
righteous judgments

CHAP. X. Verse 1. Now those that sealed, were Nehemiah the Tirshata.]
HE is first mentioned, not as a Priest, but as Provost; and one that held it
an honor to be first in so good a matter As Caesar never said to his
soldiers, Ite, but Venite, Go ye, but Come along, I will lead you: And as
Abimelech said, What ye have seen me do, made haste and do accordingly. So
should all Superiors say to their inferiors. Plin.
Vita Principis censura est, imo cynosura, the life of the Prince is the
load-star of the people, upon which most men fix their eyes, and shape their
courses. Magnates sunt Magnetes, Great men draw many by their examples, they
are as looking-glasses by which others dress themselves. And hence Nehemiah's
forwardness here to seal first. There follow in their order Priests, Levites,
Princes and people solemnly sealing a sure Covenant. God had caused them to
pass under the rod, and now he is bringing them into the bond of the Covenant,
that he may purge out the rebels from amongst them, Ezekiel. 20.37, 38.

Verse 28. That had separated themselves] In Saint Paul's sense, 2 Cor. 6.17.
Come out from among them, and be ye separate, etc. from such stand off; Stand
up from the dead, save your selves from this untoward generation, shun their
sins, lest ye share in their plagues. These holy Separates (or Proselytes)
sealed the Covenant, and became free denisons of the Commonwealth of Israel;
having right to all Gods Ordinances, Exodus 12.48. Such were Araunah the
Jebusite, 2 Samuel 24. Jether the Ismaelite, 1 Chronicles. 7.17. with 2 Samuel 17.25.
those Acts 2.10. the Jews called them Advenas Justitiae. Deodate interprets
this text of such Jews as were come again out of Babylon, to serve the Lord,
according to his Law. Others, of such as had separated themselves from their
Heathen-wives and children.

Their wives, their sons, and their daughters] These also were then, and
still may be Covenanters, as partakers of the benefit, 1 Timothy 6.2. and heirs
together of the grace of life, 1 Pet. 3.7.

Every one having knowledge] Of their own misery by sin, and of the great
mystery of godliness.

Verse 29. They clave to their brethren] Heb. They laid fast hold on them, viz.
by taking holy of the Covenant, to keep the Sabbath from polluting it, and
choosing the things that please God, as Esaias 56.4, 6.

And entered into a curse] The more to confirm the oath, and to keep their
deceitful hearts close to God. See Deuteronomy. 29.12, 21. This is called the oath of
God, Eccles. 8.2. Confer Isa. 19.18. and 44.5. 2 Chronicles. 15.12, 14. and 34.31.

To walk in Gods Law] Ex gnomone and Canone decalogi, to walk accurately and
exactly by line and by rule, In all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord
blameless, Aug. in Exodus Quaesti. 55.
Luke 1.6. so far as by his grace He should vouchsafe to assist them. For lex
jubet, gratia juvat. The bowls of the Candlestick have no oil, but what
droppeth from the olivebranches. David can wish well to the keeping of Gods
Commandments diligently, Psalm. 119.4, 5. but promise no further then God shall
please to enlarge his heart, verse 32. Vows and Covenants indefinitely and
absolutely made (as that of Jephta, Judge. 11.31.) prove a snare. Condition with
the Lord for his strength and grace; rely not on thine own sufficiency, lest it
repent thee of thy rashness and self-confidence, as it befell Peter. Consider
that thou art but a poor garison-souldier: and without supplies of the Spirit
of Jesus Christ, Phil. 1.19. thou can do nothing. David knew this, and
therefore called earnestly for help from heaven, Psalm. 51.13, 14, 15. and
119.106, 107.

Verse 30. And that we would not give our daughters] This is the first
particular branch of the Covenant, that they would make no inter-marriages with
the Heathen; as knowing the snare that herein Satan laid for their souls. In
the first sentence against man, this cause is expressed, Because thou obeyedst
the voice of thy wife, etc. By the rib (as by a ladder) Satan often climbs to the
heart, and corrupts it, as Gregory has it. O wives! (says another) the most
sweet poison, the most desired evil in the world, etc. Make a wise choice
therefore. The Heathen well says, that every man when he marries, brings
either a good or an evil spirit into his house, and so makes it either a heaven
or a hell.

Verse 31. And if the people of the land bring any ware] As they might without
the Jews leave: and did, chap. 13.16. and some of these Jews, forgetting
their Covenant, bought of them too: even the children of Juda in Jerusalem, ib.
as if they had been of her religion in the tragedy, who said, (...). that is, I
swore with my tongue, but not with my heart. But shall they thus escape by
iniquity? Be not deceived, God is not mocked: A God of truth, and without
iniquity; just and right is he, Deuteronomy. 32.4.

That we would not buy it of them] Lest we should trouble and disquiet that
holy Rest; and God should sue us upon an Action of wast: For the seventh day is
the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, Exodus 20.11. Jer. 17.21.

Or on the holy day] Now abrogated Col. 2.16.

And that we would leave the seventh yeare] That Sabbaticall year, prefiguring
the year of Grace, the Kingdom of Christ, Qui noxas and nexus omnes solveret,
who gives his people a general release, Deuteronomy. 15.2. and comes not over them
again with an after-reckoning. Peccata non redeunt. The Land also was to rest
from tillage this year, Exodus 23.11

And the exaction of every debt] For that year at least, and the next too, if
the debtor were not able to pay; the lender was to expect a recompense from
God, Deuteronomy. 15.6.

Verse 32. To charge our selves yearly with the third part of a shekel] Beside
the Poll-mony the half-shekel required, Exodus 38.26. the third part of a shekel
was no great sum, yet somewhat more then what Saul and his servant presented
the Seer with, whom they could not but know to be the Judge of Israel, 1 Samuel
9.8. These had learned, that thankfulness was measured both by God and good men
not by the weight, but by the will of the Retributor. God does highly accept
the small offerings of his weak servants, when he sees them to proceed from
great love.

Verse 33. For the shewbread] Here are recited the several uses whereunto that
tribute or Impost was put: the half-shekel enjoined by the Law being not
enough, by reason the people were as yet so few. This though Junius denies,
yet the Hebrews all consent about it.

To make an atonement] That is, an agreement, Heb. To cover or expiate; to
purge away, or take away uncleanness; to satisfy for sin, and to pacify
wrath. By the Priests making atonement legally was typified Christ's making
reconciliation betwixt God and man; for he alone is the propitiation for our
sins, 1 John 2.2. But how much mistaken were our Ancestors in times of
Popery, Act. and Mon. 1077.
who built religious houses, and gave large maintenance to them to buy off
their sins, to deliver their souls from hell, to fetch their friends out of
Purgatory, etc.

Verse 34. And we cast lots -- for the Wood-offering] Heb. Kurban or Korban as
the Gospel calls it, because by offerings they came near to God. This Wood
offering we read not of till now: the Prophet Isay tells us, that if we
should sacrifice unto God according to his excellent greatness, Lebanon would
not be sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a
burnt-offering, Chap. 40.16. There was much use of fuel about the Temple; and
it was formerly provided out of the public treasury. But that now failing,
they take another order as here; that God might not be unserved, and the daily
sacrifice neglected, which they held and called The abomination of desolation

Verse 35. And to bring the first fruits of our Ground] Heb. The firstborn.
These first fruits were the fiftieth part; and, if any would be more liberal
in paying, the fourtieth; or, being poorer, the sixtieth part.

And the first fruits of all fruits of all trees] God required to be honored
with the firstlings of all; to show how he sets by our young-services. We prize
nettle-buds when they first put forth: so does God remember and regard the
kindness of our youth. Jer. 2.1.


Verse 36. Also the firstborn of our Sonnes] These God claimed as his due,
Exodus 12.2. and 22.29. Number. 3.13. and called for, as best beloved of the
parents; that, together with them he might draw men's best affections to
himself. They were to be redeemed, as were also the firstlings of all beasts
not fit for sacrifice, Exodus 13.13. and the redemption-money brought to the
Priests (who were Gods Receivers) that they might be the better encouraged in
the Law of the Lord, as Hezekiah phraseth it, 2 Chronicles. 31.4.

To bring to the house of our God, unto the Priests] No man might offer his own
sacrifice, though it were never so good, but present it to the Priest, Levit.
17.5. who was to offer as well the poor man's Lamb, as the rich man's Ox: it is
by Christ alone that we must draw nigh to God, etc.

Verse 37. And that we should bring the first fruits of our dough] As often as
they baked, they gave a Cake unto the Priests; where they dwelled, throughout
the Tribes: for they were dispersed all abroad the land for instruction of the
people, and exhortation to obedience to the Law of God. See Number. 15.20, 21.

And the tithes of our ground unto the Levites] And the tithes were paid to the
Levites, not to the Priests: and out of them, the Levites paid a tenth to the
Priests.

In all the Cities of our tillage] No places were tyth-free.

Verse 38. And the Priest the Son of Aaron] That Son of Aaron by an eminency,
the High Priest.

Shall be with the Levites] To see that right be done, and to make an equal
distribution.

When the Levites take tythes] As their Due, and not as a benevolence from the
people. Melchizedech tythed Abraham, Heb. 7.6. It is your reward or wages which
you dearly earne, and may justly call for, Number. 19.31. The chief of the Levites
demanded their due, when they were not thought of: but, by great oversight,
were passed over in the division, Josh. 21.1.

And the Levites shall bring up] See the Note on verse 37.

Verse 39. And we will not forsake the house of God] But frequent it our
selves, and see that the Priests that minister, the porters and singers forsake
it not, for want of necessary maintenance: as they were shortly after this,
forced to do, And to fly every one to his field, Neh. 13.10. For a subsistence.

CHAP. XI. Verse 1. And the Rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem.
THis City, being before repaired, begins now to be repeopled. See chap.
7.4. The Rulers there took up their seat, (as was fit, and as in all chief
Cities is usual) so that thither the Tribes went up, the Tribes of the Lord,
etc. And there were set the Thrones of Judgment, Psalm. 122.5.

The rest of the people also cast lots] The dispose whereof is wholly of the
Lord: and therefore none could reasonably repine.

To bring one of ten] This shadowed out the paucity of those that shall inhabit
the heavenly Jerusalem; according to Isai. 6.13. Jer. 3.14. Christ at last day
will do as Joshua did (says a Divine) to find out who had stolen the
Babylonish garment: there were many brought together, and all to find out one,
Josh. 7. So all shall then appear: out of them a final number seducted, that
have heard of Christ: out of them those that have professed him: and out of
them, those that have professed in sincerity: and these.

-- Numero vix sunt totidem, quot
Thebarum portae, vel divitis ostia Nili. J^venal. Sat. 13

How many, think you, Hom. 4. ad pop. Antioch,
shall be saved in this City, (said Chrysostom to the people of Antioch, where
he had long preached, and was much admired,) It will be a hard speech to you,
but I will speak it; though there be so many thousands of you, yet there cannot
be found an hundred, that shall be saved: and I doubt of them too; for what
villainy is there in youth? What sloth, in old age? and so he goes on.

The holy City] Jerusalem is so called, because God had chosen it to set his
name there. The Heathen God-haters had always an edge against it, and this
made people so unwilling to inhabit it. Our Edward the First had too high a
conceit of it, when he charged his Son upon his deathbed to carry his heart
thither, and left 32000. pounds for that purpose.

Verse 2. And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves]
All the Volunteers, those Liberi and libentes, that moved with a zeal of God,
and his service, seated themselves at Jerusalem; though it were little for
their safety or profit. Sincerity is an enemy to Sinisterity; it streines out
selfe-respects, and procures a man great respect in the hearts of good people,
who are ready to commend them and pray for them, as here.

Verse 3. Now these are the chief of the province] So Judea is called, because
now subject and tributary to the King of Babylon; as afterward it was to the
Romans (and is therefore called a province, Act. 25.1.) and is now to the Turk.
How then could those Jews in the Gospel say, John 8.33.
We are Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man, but that they
cared not what they said in abravado? Spaniards are said to be impudent
braggers: and extremely proud in the lowest ebb of fortune. These Jews were so
certainly; and so they continue.

Ver. 4. Certain of the children of Judah, etc.] Yea and of the children of
Ephraim, and Manasseth too, 1 Chronicles. 9.3. Where the same is set down as here,
but the number is greater. And why? here only those are reckoned who inhabited
Jerusalem by lot: but there, the Volunteers also. See verse 2.

Verse 5. And Maaseiah the Son of Baruch] See the Note on Ezra 2.3.

Ver. 6. Valiant men] Heb. Men of ability and activity. It comprehends all
the four Cardinal virtues.

Verse. 7.8.] Little Benjamin, the smallest of the Tribes of Israel, 1 Samuel
9.23. yields more by half, then Judah. Jerusalem stood in both these Tribes.

Verse. 9. Their overseer] Or Commissary.

Verse. 11. Ruler of the house of God] One of the Highpriests great Deputies,
See Number. 3.32. 1 Chronicles. 9.11. 2 Chronicles. 19.11.

Verse. 12, 13, 14.] In all 1192. The total of Priests and Levites 1476. and of
Judah and Benjamin 1396. So that there were more Priests and Levites then of
the Lay People; which argues their zeal to be greatest. There were also 172.
Porters, who were all Levites.

Verse. 17. To begin the thanksgiving in prayer] To set tunes to Psalms of
praise, and to begin those tunes as Precentor chief-chaunter.

Verse. 18.19.] See verse. 12.13.

Verse. 20. Were in all the Cities] Dispersed abroad to instruct the people, and
to be as the salt of the Earth, to keep it from putrefying.

Verse. 21. Dwelt in Ophel] See chap. 3.26. Some will have it to be not a Tower,
but a Village, near to Jerusalem.

Verse. 22. The Over-seer] The Vulgar has it, the Bishop.

Verse. 23. The Kings] Viz. of Persia. Ezra 6.8, 9. and 7.2, 24.

Verse. 24. At the Kings hand] Was his Plenipotentiary.

Verse. 25. In the villages thereof] Heb. In the daughters; for villages seem to
be so to the greater Cities.

CHAP. XII. Verse 1. Now these are the Priests and the Levites.]
ANCESTORS to those that dedicated the walls: and here registered, as for
honors sake to themselves, so to show that their successors, now employed in
this work, were true Priests and Levites of a right descent and alloy.

That went up with Zerubbabel] Together with those that came afterward with
Ezra. Ezr. 8.2, 3, 18, 19.

Verse. 2. Amariah, Malluch,] See the Note on Ezr. 2.3.

Verse 8. Which was over the thanksgiving] Praefectus Musicus. See Chap. 11.17.

Verse. 9. In their Watches] In the order of their functions, taking their turns.

Verse. 10. Joiakim begat Eliashib] Who proved a very wicked Priest, Chap. 13.4,
5. and his Son Joiada was little better, being allied to Sanballat, Chap.
13.28.

Verse. 11. And Jonathan begat Jadduah,] Who was High Priest in Alexander the
Greats time; and meeting him, in his formalities, prevailed with him to spare
the City Jerusalem, and to confirm the privileges thereof, as Josephus
reports. Antiq. Jud. Lib. 1^. c. 8.


Verse. 22. To the reign of Darius the Persian] Viz. Darius Godomannus, the
last Persian King.

Verse. 23. In the book of the Chronicles] Sc. 1 Chronicles. 9.10, etc.

Johanan the Son of Eliashib] That is Jonathan the Grandchild of Eliashib, and
the Son of Joiada.

Verse. 27. And at the dedication of the Wall] To set down which is the main
scope of this whole Chapter.

Verse. 30. Purified themselves, and purified the people] But first themselves:
because who so would reform others, must begin with himself, as Lyra here
notes.

Verse. 34. Judah and Benjamin] i. e. Men so called.

Verse. 36. And Ezra before them] Before the first company, as Nehemiah came
after the second, verse 3. As the first went round from the West Southward till
they came to the East: so the second company went from the West Northward, till
they came to the East, where they both met at length in the Temple, verse 41.
Praising God with all sorts of music vocal and isntrumental. This was a most
solemn and sacred procession, far different from those of the Papists. The
French Historian ^elleth us of their Henry, that going in procession together
with his Cardinal, they had in the middle betwixt them Morionem, nugas and
ineptias agentem, a jester to make them sport: here was good devotion
therewhile. The Philosopher told the Fiddlers, he could be merry without them.
Epit. Hist. Gallic. 191.
And Aristotle being asked what he thought of music? answered, Jovem nec
canere, neque cytharam pulsare, Jupiter neither sings nor plays on an
instrument. But though God needs it not, cares not for it: yet so far as it
might excite and further devotion, these holy Priests and Levites made use of
the musical instruments of David (called musical instruments of God, 1 Chronicles.
16.42) and Ezra before them, as a guide: they also sang aloud, and so generally
rejoiced, That their joy was heard even afar off. Verse. 42.43. This was right.

Verse. 39. And from above the gate of Ephraim] Much mention is here made of the
several gates and Towers; because God was much seen in helping them so soon to
build such: and, by the sight of them, they were much excited to praise the
Lord.

Verse. 43. For God had made them rejoice with great joy] By giving them both
matter of joy, and hearts to do it aright. Creed mihi res severa est verum
gaudium, says Seneca, true joy is a severe business. Quid nobis cum fabulis,
cum risu? says Bernard. What have we to do with jesting and pastime, etc? we
have meat to eat, pleasure to take that the world wots not of; we can let out
our souls into God the fountain of all good; and rejoice in his Word, as one
that finds great spoil, wherein the pleasure is as much as the profit, Psalm.
119.162.

Verse 44. For Judah rejoyced] Heb. For the joy of Judah, the oil of spiritual
gladness had so dilatated their hearts, that they were most ready and willing
to provide for the sacred Ministers; and to pay them that which was appointed,
as they had also newly covenanted to do.

For the Priests and the Levites that waited] Heb. That stood, sc. before the
Lord, and served in their courses. These they not only applauded, but
liberally maintained. Nowadayes Ministers shall have hard work and good words,
but slight wages. Men deal by them as Carriers do by their horses, lay heavy
burdens upon them, and then hang bells about their necks, etc.

CHAP. XIII. Verse 1. On that day]
THat great Fast Day, chap. 9.1, 2, etc. Or, after Nehemiah's return from the
Court of Persia, verse 6. so the most expound it.

They read in the book of Moses] Viz. In Deuteronomy, (chap. 23.3.) called by
the Rabbines Sepher tochechoth, the book of Rebukes, or of Instructions, upon
conviction.

And therein was found written] Perquam durum est, (so it might seem to
Ammonites and Moabites) sed ita lex scripta est, Ulpian. p.
The Law was perpetual and indispensable: a sign of great wrath.

That the Ammonite and the Moabite] Lots by-blowes, and the Churches constant
enemies.

Into the Congregation of God] i. e. Assemblies of Gods people, whether sacred
or civil, unless proselyted.

Ver. 2. Because they met not the children of Israel] A bare omission of
observance, subjected them to divine vengeance. As God requiteth the least
courtesy done to his people, be it but a cup of cold water: so he repayeth the
least discourtesie, or but neglect of them, to whom the glorious Angels are
ministering spirits, and may not think themselves too good to serve them, Heb.
1. ult.

But hired Baalam against them] With the rewards of divination, Number. 22.7. the
wages of wickedness, Jude 11.2 Pet. 2.15. which he greedily ran after; and not
so much as roving at God, made the world his standing-mark, till he had got a
sword in his guts.

Howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing] So he did the Popes curse to
Queen Elizabeth; Tom. 1 Epist.
and, before her, to Luther. Quo magis illi furunt, eo amplius procedo, says
He in a certain Epistle; the more they rage and ban me, the more I proceed, and
prosper. The Pope excommunicated him, Scultet. Annal.
the Emperor proscribed him, etc. Omnium animi tum erant arrecti, quid illa
Caesaris and pontificis fulmina essent effectura. All men's minds were then set
an end, and stood on tip-toes, as it were, to see what would be the issue,
says mine Author. A wonderful work of our God surely, and worthy to be
chronicled! Luther is conveyed out of the way by the Elector of Saxony for ten
months, till he would be hid no longer. Meanwhile Pope Leo dies, the
Emperor Charles the fifth is first called into Spain to suppress seditions
there, and afterward is so busied in his wars with the French King, that he
has no leisure to look after Luther. After this, when the French King was
beaten by the Emperor, and carried prisoner into Spain, he was released and
sent home again, upon condition, that the Emperor and He should root out the
Lutheran Heresy, as they called it. But our God broke their designs, and
turned this curse also into a blessing. For the French King returning home, and
conceiving that the conditions (that he had yielded unto, to get off) were
unequal, enters into a League with the Pope and the State of Venice against
the Emperor. The Pope (that he might cover his false dealing with the
Emperor) sends abroad his Bull, and therein calls knave first. The Emperor
on the otherside complains of the Popes malice, and double-dealing, exhorts
him to peace, and concludes, that it were fitter for them to unite against the
Lutherans. And when he could prevail nothing by writing, he abolisheth his
authority throughout all Spain, sends his armies against him under the Duke of
Burbon, claps him up prisoner in Saint Angelo, proclaims open war against the
French, etc. So that Religion got ground, and all things fell out rather unto
the furtherance of the Gospel, Phil. 1.12. Let them curse thy Church Lord, but
do thou bless: when they arise, let them ever be ashamed; but let thy servants
rejoice, Psalm. 10 ^ 28.
and speed the better for their ill wishes. So be it.

Verse 3. Now it came to pass when they had heard the Law] And were
transformed into the same image therewith, by the Spirit of grace, who had made
their flinty hearts to become fleshy, etc. We use to say, As hard-hearted as a
Jew. But they that relent not; repent not at the hearing of the Word, are worse
then these Jews; and it may be feared that the Lord has a purpose to destroy
them. The Law of the Lord, when but read only, is perfect, converting the soul,
Psalm. 19.7. but woe to the irreformable; 2 Corinthians. 4.4.

And they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude] Vulgus promiscuum. the
rabble of strangers, wherewith this people were haunted and pestered from the
very first; Exodus 12.38. Number. 11.4. These, moved with miracles, removed with
them out of Egypt, but for a mischief to them, for they drew them into sin
then, as those here did also; and were therefore worthily put away, as the Law
required.

Verse 4. And before this] Before the Commandment came as a Lamp, and the Law a
Light (as Prove. 6.23.) causing a Reformation. As Toads and Serpents grow in
dark and dirty sellars: so do sinful disorders in ignorant places and persons.

Eliashib the Priest] The High Priest; but such an one, as from whom
profaneness went forth into all the land, Jer. 23.15. The sins of Teachers,
are Teachers of sins.

Having the oversight of the chamber] i. e. Of all the chambers of the Temple,
by virtue of his office; and therefore thought belike, he might do what he
listed with them (now in Nehemiah's absence) without control.

Was allied unto Tobiah] A bitter enemy to Gods people, but sly and subtle,
seeking to insinuate by alliances, and letters of persuasion; such as Cardinal
Sadolet wrote to the Genevenses in Calvin's absence, and Cardinal Lorraine to
the Protestant Princes of Germany, that he and his brethren the Guises (those
sworn swordmen of the Devil) would embrace the reformed Religion.

Verse 5. And he had prepared for him a great chamber] Called chambers, verse
9. for he had laid many chambers into one, says Junius, by taking down the
partitions, and furnishing the same for his friend and ally Tobiah.

Verse 6. But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem] And thence it was that
things grew so far out of order. So when Moses was gone into the Mount, the
people set up the golden Calf: they turned aside quickly, says God, Exodus
32.8. So were the Corinthians and Galatians so soo^^, as Saint Paul's back was
but turned upon them, Gal. 1.6. Levitate prorsus desultoria. And so were these
Jews, notwithstanding their better purposes, promises, Covenants; yea, and
beginnings of Reformation. See chap. 10.30.

And after certain days) Heb. At the end of days; that is, at a years end,
as Vatablus and Genebrard expound it. No longer then a year was Nehemiah away
from his Government, (to show his dutiful respect to his Master the King of
Persia, and to negotiate for his Nation) but all things were out of frame, so
well had the Devil and his instruments bestirred them. But Junius rendereth the
text, exactis aliquot annis, certain years being past: and Lyra thus, at the
end of his days, or of his life, when he now waxed old he had a desire to go
and reform things amiss at Jerusalem, and to die, and lay his bones there. So
likewise Funccius, the eighth year after his return to Artaxerxes, which was
also the last year of his reign. And indeed one would wonder how in less then
one years space things so well settled, should be so far disjoynted; but that
the Devil is (...) the great Troubler, and had by sin hurled (at first)
confusion over the whole creation, in an instant.

Verse 7. And I came to Jerusalem] There was his heart before; Animus est ubi
amat, non ubi animat: No sooner therefore had he got his congedelere at Court,
Aug. de civ. Dei l. 9. c. 16.
but he hies to Jerusalem, as the Doves do to their windows. Fugiendum est ad
clarissimam patriam: ibi pater, ibi omnia, says Plotinus the Philosopher;
hasten we all to our heavenly home, there is all that heart can wish, etc.
Nehemiah lacks nothing with Artaxerxes, Hadad with Pharaoh; Yet in any case,
will go into his own Country, 1 Kings 11.22. Rivers run into the Sea, whence
they came: the Dove rests not but upon the Ark. Ovid.
Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos Ducit --

And understood of the evil that Eliashib did] As Joseph brought his brethrens
evil report to their father, Genesis 37.2. as the household of Chloe declared unto
Saint Paul the contentions at Corinth, 1 Cor. 1.11. so did some good souls this
Highpriests miscarriages to Nehemiah, and that in an Ordinance; not to
disgrace him, but to reclaim him, and to free themselves from the guilt of a
sinful silence.

Verse 8. And it grieved me sore] Such was his zeal for God, that he could not
bear it; no more could Phineas those two naughty packs, (...).
nor Paul the Idolatry of Athens, Acts 17.16. his spirit was moved, he was in a
fit, yea almost besides himself, as the word signifies. This the mad world
counts madness, 2 Cor. 5.13. but madness in it is case is better then
mopishnesse, and the true Zelot may answer his adversaries as David did Michal,
2 Samuel 6.21. or as Basil did the threatening Prefect, who told him that he was
mad, Opto me in aeternum sic delirare, I wish I may be so mad to my lives end.

Therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah] As a profane thing,
not fit to be in so holy a place. True zeal, as fire, is active, and says,
shall I budge, stop, or step back, because hoc Ithacus velit? remit of my
diligence for fear of a frown, loss, mischief? Out of doors with this
bondwoman and her son; down with this piece of grass, Let Adoniah die,
though Bathsheba intercede for him, etc.

Verse 5 Then I commanded] This was Governour-like; and blessed be He that has
a stomach for God, and will do his utmost for him, as occasion requires. Of
Nehemiah it might well be said, as Chrysostom does of Peter, that he was like
a man made all of fire, walking among stubble; or, like Basil, who was said to
be a pillar of fire; he was of such a masculine, disengaged, courageous
disposition.

And they cleansed the chamber] The Levites did, with their legal rites and
purifications, according to their office, which Nehemiah would not invade.

And thither brought I againe] And so set things to rights, as our late
Reformers began happily to do; but Satan has hitherto hindered them.

Verse 10. Panoimi^.
And I perceived] Heb. I took knowledge, and was soon sensible of it, as a
great public mischief: for ad tenuitatem beneficiorum necessario sequitur
socordia sacerdetum, lean benefices make leaden Ministers. This, the
Magistrate must look to, and provide that they may have the double honor that
is due to them, 1 Timothy ^ 17.
of countenance and maintenance; or else Religion will soon go to wreck.

That the portions of the Levites had not been given them] And why? because the
High Priest was so bad, and the Levites therefore thought to be little better.
How apt are men to dispute God out of his own? How witty to save their purses?
How ready to say with William Rufus, The Church-bread is sweetbread? and with
Julian the Apostate, to take away the Ministers maintenance, pretending
conscience; for that too much Living would be a burden to them: and who knows
how Eliashib and his ^^ites may misimploy it?

For the Levites and singers that did the work] And are therefore worthy of
their wages, must have their honorary stipends, or cannot subsist; are not of
the Chamaeleon-kind, to live by air: but, as harvest-labourers, must have that
which is good; as Oxen that tread out the corn, must have more then straw
allowed them.

Were fled every one to his field] For stark need, in the fail of
Temple-maintenance; they were glad to do as they might, and let their charge
lie. Though Tithes were not paid, yet they had some glebe-land to live upon.

Verse 11. Then contended I with the Rulers] Who had let loose the golden
reins of authority, and, by a passive Ministry at least, suffered this
sacrilege, whilst they bare the sword in vain, if they were not chief actours
in it: as Luther complains of the Rulers of his time; Luth. in Genesis 47.
Nisi superesset spolium Aegypti quod rapuimus Papae, etc. If we had not some
of the spoils of Egypt, pulled from the Pope; all we Ministers of the Gospel
might be famished: and this little that is left us, is violently taken from us
by the civil Magistrate. Parishes and Schools are polled and spoiled by them,
as if they meant to starve us all. Thus Luther, and more to this purpose.

Why is the house of God forsaken] By your slacknesse and covetoursnesse,
contrary to your Covenant, chap. 10.39?

And I gathered them together] i. e. The scattered Levites, that Gods service
might be no longer intermitted, Eccles. 8.10.
and his wrath thereby provoked. Thus Nehemiah, whatever his hand found to do,
did it with all his might; as David danced, as Baruc builded, etc. he went
through-stitch with his work.

And set them in their place] Heb. Made them stand in their standing, as if
absque stationibus istis non staret mundus, without those standings, the world
could not stand.

Verse 12. Then brought all Judah] Then, when there was no other remedy. There
must be a compulsory means, or Ministers shall be poorly maintained. Quod si
sustentandi essent de contributione populi, misere profecto and duriter
viverent, faith Luther. If once they be brought to live upon the peoples
benevolence, they shall have a poor life of it. Once (in times of Popery) there
was need of a Statute of Mortmain, providing that they should give no more to
the Church. But now it is otherwise: these last and worst times have seen the
springs of bounty, like Jordan turned back; which heretofore did run so fresh
and fast into the Church. This was written Jul. 30. A. D. 1653.
Our Statesmen have Ministers maintenance now under debate; and much lifting
there is by a levelling-party (not without a Jesuit to help them) at Tithes,
and College-lands. The Lord direct our Rulers; and preserve us out of the hands
of those hateful Harpyes.

Verse 13. And I made treasurers] Nehemiah left nothing undone that might befit
a vigilant and valiant Governor. He was omnibus numeris absolutus, every way
complete.

For they were counted faithful] A singular praise in persons entrusted, 1 Cor.
4.2. See Nehem. 7.2. Number. 12.7. Such men as these are now gone in pilgrimage
(as one says) and their return is altogether uncertain. When one desired to
see Alexanders treasures, he showed him not his wealth, but his friends.
Nehemiah might have done the like by these faithful treasures, precious pieces
surely, rare and rich jewels.

And their office was] Heb. It was upon them. Duty is a debt; which till it be
discharged, a good heart cannot rest.

To distribute unto their brethren] To a treasure are required, 1. A laying in:
2. A lying his: 3. A drawing out: So to a Treasurer, that he receive readily,
keep carefully, distribute prudently.

Verse 14. Remember me, O my God] See chap. 5.19.

And wipe not out my good deeds] Forget not my labor of love: God requires us
to be his remembrancers, who yet needs it not, Heb. 6.10. there is a book of
remembrance written before him, Mal. 3.16. and good Nehemiah would not be wiped
out of that book, nor blotted out of the book of life, Rev. 3.5. That wretched
Monk died blasphemously, who said, Read mihi aeternam vitam quam debes, Give
me heaven which thou owe me.

That I have done] Sure it is, says Austin, that we do what good we do: but it
is God alone, who causes us so to do. Say therefore, Not unto us Lord, not to
us, but to thy Name be the praise.

Verse 15. In those days saw I in Judah] He was centoculus, and had his eye in
every corner, to find out and redress abuses: wherein he was incessant and
indefatigable. He chose rather to be counted a busy Justice, then a quiet
Gentleman.

Some treading wine-presses on the Sabbath-day] These Jews were not so loose,
but their posterity at this day are (in some respects) as much over-strict, as
is elsewhere noted.

Dum vitant stulti vitium, in contraria currunt. And bringing in sheaves] As a
work of necessity.

As also wine, grapes and figs] As a work of mercy. So they would plead likely.
Sin and shifting came into the world together, no evil wants its excuse: but
the covering is too shot, and God will wash off that varnish, with rivers of
brimstone.

And all manner of burthens] They did not so much as keep Sabbatum Asinorum, a
rest from servile employments. See Jer. 17.21.

And I testified against them] i. e. I challenged them as impious for so doing,
and provokers of Gods wrath, traitors to the State, Verse 18. This should
every man do in his place. A certain Indian coming by, and seeing one of the
New-English profaning the Lords day by felling of a tree, said to him, Thou
much mached man, that is, Thou very wicked man, What, break you Gods day?
know thou not that this is the Lord's Day in Massaqusets? that is, in one of
the English plantations so called? New-Eng. first fruits.


In the day wherein they sold victuals] A practice too much in use in this
Nation, till keeping of Markets and Faires on the Christian Sabbath was put
down by authority; and especially by that late good Act for the sanctification
of the Lord's Day, grossly broken in this kind, under many of the Bishops
noses; yea, made a voyder and dunghill, for all refuse business.

Verse 16. There dwelt men of Tire also] Phaenician Merchants had their Factors
in Jerusalem.

And all manner of ware] Merchandise; for Tire was a great Mart-town, and
famous for fishing, Ezekiel. 27.

And sold on the Sabbath] Which they ought not to have done: for that was Gods
market day, and not mars.

Unto the children of Judah] Who were therefore worse then the Tyrians, because
they ought to have been better: therefore wrath shall be upon the Jew first,
and then upon the Gentile, Romans 2.

And in Jerusalem] This holy City was become an harlot. Filthiness in a Stews
is nothing so odious as in a Virgin: a nettle in a Wilderness, is not so
unsightly as in a Garden. In a land of uprightness to do wickedly, is an
aggravating circumstance, Isa. 26.10.

Verse 17. Then contended I with the Nobles] Heb. With the white ones; that had
white-clothes, but black souls. The snow-drift covers many a muck-hill See ver.
11.

What evil thing is this that ye do?] Or suffer, others to do at least, and are
therefore worthily shent; as Moses also was for like cause, Exodus 16.28.

And profane the Sabbath day] As if it were a common day, and not Gods
enclosure, holy and honorable. Should men thus rob God of his right, unmound
his Several, make false entry upon his freehold? Has He not singled out this
day for his own, as He did Israel out of all Nations, the tree of knowledge out
of all the trees of the garden, and out of all the world, (which is his) the
tenth? This is the day which the Lord has made, etc. it is a day like that
night, Exodus 12.42. to be kept holy unto the Lord; that day of the Lord which
all his people must keep throughout their generations. To profane it or wound
it, is here called an evil thing with an accent, a wickedness with a witness.

Verse 18. Did not your fathers thus?] And will ye abet, and add to their
wicked practices? Will ye needs espouse their sins, as a seed of Serpents?

And did not our God bring all this evil upon us?] And that justly, because
Belshazzar-like, though we knew all this, yet we lifted up our selves against
the Lord of heaven, as the horse that casts his rider, Dan. 5.22, 23. lob.
9.4.
and rises up against him. Has ever any waxed fierce against God, and
prospered? Was not he that but gathered sticks upon the Sabbathday paid home
with stones? Was there not for this very sin a fire kindled in the gates of
Jerusalem, that devoured the Palaces thereof, Jer. 17.27? Justly is he made an
example, that will not take example by others: and it is a sure both presage
and desert of ruin, not to be warned.

Yet ye bring more wrath] As if ye had a mind to wrestle a fall with the
Almighty, and to try for mastery. But do ye provoke the Lord to anger? are ye
stronger then he?

Verse 19. When the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark] As they did betimes;
because the mountains were round about Jerusalem, Psalm. 125.2. Leo Modena.


Before the Sabbath] That there might be a due preparation, without
interruption. At this day in many Cities where the Jews reside, there is one
goes about and proclaims the approaching of the Sabbath, about half an hour
before Sunset the day before; that they may set all aside to sanctify it.

I commanded that the gates should be shut] And thereby all such occasions of
profaning shut out.

And charged that they should not be opened till after the Sabbath] So King
Edgar ordained that Sunday should be solemnized from Saturday nine of the
clock, Acts and Mon.
till Monday morning here in this Land, that God might surely have his due. The
Jews of Tiberias began the Sabbath sooner then others. Those at Tsepphore
continued it longer, adding de profano ad sacrum. Bu^torf.
Hence R. Jose wished that his portion might be with those of Tiberias, and
ended it with those of Tsepphore.

And some of my servants set I at the gates] To keep them carefully, and to
prevent profanations. How the Athenians amerced those that came not to the
Assemblies on holy days, hurdling up all the streets, except them that led to
the Ecclesia, taking away all their saleable wares, etc. See Rous his
Archaeolog. Attic. page 103.

Verse 20. So the Merchants -- lodged without Jerusalem] They would not easily
be said, or take an answer, so desirous they were of some takings from the
Jews. There is nothing in the world that is more pertinacious, and that
cleaves closer to a man then a strong lust; say it be covetousness,
wantonness, passionatenesse, or any the like, entreat it to be gone, as Naomi
did Ruth, threaten it as Abner did Asael, or as Nehemiah did these Merchants,
you prevail nothing, till God comes and strikes a parting-blow, etc.

Verse 21. Why lodge ye about the wall?] His care was also, lest God should be
dishonored in the Suburbs. A little fire warmes but a little way off: when a
great one casts about its heat far and near. He feared also lest those
within the walls, seeing them, might be tempted to wish themselves with them;
as when Sylla the Roman lay before the walls of Athens, the Citizens minds were
with him, though their bodies were kept from him.

I will lay hands on you] I will lay you fast enough: be packing therefore. The
best way to be rid of sin, is to threaten it, punish it, by the practice of
mortification, to handle it roughly. We are not debtors to the flesh, Romans
8.12. We owe it nothing but stripes, nothing but the blue eye Saint Paul gave
it, 1 Cor. 9.27. (...).


Verse 22. And I commanded the Levites] He might do it, as their Governor. How
then can Popish Priests exempt themselves from the power of the civil
Magistrate? and say, as those shavelings did to our Henry the second, when they
lashed him on the bare till the blood followed, Domine, noli minari; nos enim
de tali curia sumus, quae consuevit imperare regibus, and Imperatoribus; that
is, Sir, spare your threats; for we are of that high Court of Rome which is
wont to Lord it over Kings and Emperors? Might he not have well replied, Ye
take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi; or rather, ye limbs of Antichrist?

Come and keep the gates] The Temple-gates, with -- Procul hinc, procul este
profani. In Greece the Priest, at their solemn sacrifices, was wont to ask
(...) Who Is there? and the people were to answer, (...). Here are many, and
those also good men.

To sanctify the Sabbath day] By severing the precious from the vile: and
seeing that all things were rightly carried by themselves and the rest.

Remember me, etc.] See verse 14.

And spare me] Meritum meum est misericordia Domini. Horreo quicquid de meo
est, ut sim meus. Thomas Aquinas lying on his deathbed, Bern.
and being about to receive the Lords Supper, besought the Lord with tears that
he would spare him according to his abundant goodness: and snatching up the
Bible, he hugged it, and said, Vol^ter.
I believe all the contents of this blessed Book. The like is reported of
William Wickam, Founder of New-College Oxon, and of Charles the fifth Emperor,
and some other wiser Papists.

Verse 23. In those days saw I Jewes] Outwardly, at least, (as the Apostle
distinguishes, Romans 2.28.) and that also was then a prerogative, Romans 3.1. and
shall appear to be so again, when their long-looked for conversion-day is
come, Romans 11.

That had married wives of Ashdod] Outlandish-wives, and of another Religion:
and with these they cohabited, as the Hebrew word here imports.

Verse 24. And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod] They had a
mixture of their mothers both speech and spirit; the birth followed the belly,
the Conclusion followed the weaker Proposition.

And could not speak in the Jews language] Though it were that of their
fathers. Mothers are most about children, and have the greater advantage to
perfume them, or poison them. But what mad fellows were those old Britains or
Welsh-men, who driven out of their own Country by the Saxons, came into
little Britain in France: where, when they had married wives, they are said to
have cut out their tongues, Heyl. Geog.
left they should corrupt the language of their children? Hence the British or
Welsh language remains still in that Country.

Verse 25. And cursed them] i. e. I denounced Gods heavy curse and vengeance
upon them (according to that themselves had wished and entered into, chap.
10.30.) in case they repented not. This is nothing then, in favor of our
cursing men, who are cursed men, etc.

And smote certain of them] So far was his heart enraged with an holy hatred
of their sin, that he could not forbear them. So when Charles the fifth had
heard that Farnesius, (General of the Popes forces) had ravished certain
Ladies, he brake out into this speech (and was never in all his life observed
to be more angry at any thing) Si adesset impurus ille Farnesius, manu mea
confoderem. O if I had here that filthy fellow, I would slay him with mine own
hand.

And mads them swear by God] So they had done before, chap. 10.29, 30. But now
alas they were all gone aside, they were altogether become filthy, they stank
above ground. Psalm. 143.
He takes therefore another oath of them, etc.

Verse 26. Did not Solomon King of Israel, etc.] Did not he deviate and
prevaricate in his old age, shamefully turning from the Lord who had appeared
unto him twice? Did not his strange wives draw him to strange practices;
insomuch as some have doubted of his salvation, and Bellarmine reckons him
(but wrongfully) amongst reprobates?

Yet among many Nations was there no King like him] For honor, pleasure,
wisdom, and wealth, etc. the abundance he had of these drew out his spirits,
and dissolved him. See Mark 10.23, 25. 1 Timothy 6.9. Isa. 39.1, 2.

Who was beloved of his God] His corculum, his darling, his Jedidiah, 2 Samuel
12.25. but he did not reciprocate: his heart was dis-joynted and hung loose
from the Lord, whom he grievously provoked by his sensuality, and apostasy.

And God made him King over all Israel] Not by right of inheritance (for he was
a younger brother) but by special designation. Yet he defiled that Throne
whereunto God had so graciously advanced him: this was a great aggravation of
his sin: 2 Samuel 12.7, 8. Deuteronomy. 32.12, 19. Amos 2.9.

Nevertheless, even him did outlandish women cause to sinne] And that most
shamefully: Never was there a wiser man than Solomon; and never any Saint fell
into more foolish lusts. Job, who had the greatest adversity that ever man
felt, fell much: but Solomon, who had the greatest prosperity that ever man
saw, fell more.

Verse 27. To do all this great evil] Here are three articles in the Hebrew,
importing the heinousness of this sin. See the like Genesis 39.9.

To transgress against our God] No sin can be little, because a disloyalty
(so the word signifies) against so great a God, and his most holy Law; a
sacrilegious trespass.

Verse 28. And one of the sons of Jehoiada] His grand-sonne Manasses, brother
to Jaddua the High Priest, John 4.20. Joseph. lib. 11. An. iq cap. 7.
a vile Apostata, and first author of that famous schism, and deadly feud
betwixt the Samaritans and Jews.

Was son in Law to Sanballat] Who, to keep him to his wife, built a fair
Temple on Mount Gerizim, hard by the City Sichem, and made Manasses chief
Priest thereof.

Therefore I chased him from me] I caused him to be excommunicated, and
banished from amongst us.

Remember them, O my God] For evil, as me for good, verse 31. and in both
remember the relation that is betwixt thee and my soul. Woe be to those whom
Gods people do thus turn over to Him to be punished.

Because they have defiled the Priesthood] Corruption optimi pessima: as
sweetest wine makes the sowrest vinegar, A wicked Priest is the worst creature
upon earth.

And the Covenant, etc.] See the Note on Mal. 2.4.

Verse 30. Thus cleansed I them from all strangers] As from so much filth and
rubbish. I made them either put away their strange wives, or quit their places.
He did not raise a dust only, but not remove it, as Luther wittily says of
the Cardinals and Prelates, that met at Rome about Reformation of the Church.
Slcid. Com.
These he compared to Foxes that came to sweep an house full of dust with their
tails; and instead of sweeping it out, swept it all about the house, and made
a great smoke for the while; but when they were gone, the dust all fell down
again. Nehemiah made clean work, and so purged the Priesthood, that he made
it shine again, as the word here signifies: the Priests were (as Chrysostom
says all Ministers should be) puroires coelo, clearer then the azured sky;
and as those Nazarites, Lum. 4.7. purer then snow, whiter then milk, etc.

Verse 31. And for the wood-offering] See chap. 10.34, 35.

Remember me, O my God, for good] See chap. 5.19. and 13.15, 22. He brags not,
but prays, producing his good deeds as testimonies of his sincerity, whereof he
begs acceptance. And this is a sweet close of the Old Testament, (say our last
and largest Annotations upon the Bible) for this was the last history and book
thereof, though the book of Esther be set after it. Malachy propliesied anon
after the Temple was built, as we see, (says Master Pemble,) by his reproving
of that sin, in corrupting the holy seed by marrying strangers. Bib. sacr. 11.
Sixtus Senensis places him as low as about five hundred years before Christ.
Many of the ancients make him to be the same with Ezra. Nehemiah then, as it
may seem, has the honor of putting a perclose to the Old Testament: and he
does it with this short, but pithy prayer, which he utters (as Luther used to
pray) tanta reverentia, ut si Deo; and tanta fiducia, ut si amico: with so
great reverence, as to God; and yet with so great confidence, In vit. Luth.
as to his God, a God in Covenant with him. Remember me, O my god, for good.
Fiat, Fiat.

A COMMENTARY OR EXPOSITION Upon the BOOK of ESTHER.
CHAP. I. Verse 1. Now it came to pass in the days of Ahashuerus]
THis Book is in the Hebrew called Esther: because she is a chief party therein
mentioned and memorized. The Rabbines call it Megillath Esther, that is, the
volume of Esther; and further tell us that there be five such volume of
Scripture-books; viz. Solomon's Song, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and this
of Esther: which they use to read all over in their Synagogues, at five several
times of the year. 1. Solomon's Song, at the Passover; in remembrance of their
once-deliverance out of Egypt, and their future salvation by the Messiah. 2.
Ruth at Pentecost; because therein is set down the Genealogy of David their
first King. 3. The Lamentations of Jeremy on the ninth day of the fifth month
(that is, of July;) in regard of the Babylonish captivity, and ruin of the
Temple. 4. Ecclesiastes, at the feast of Tabernacles; in a thankful remembrance
of the Divine Providence asserted in that Book; and exercised over them in a
special manner, when they wandered in the wilderness. 5. Lastly, this of
Esther, on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar or February:
and as often as they hear mention of Haman, they do, even to this day, R. Abraham
Hispanus tognom. (...).
with their fists and hammers beat upon the benches and boards, as if they did
beat upon Hamans head. They tell us that this Book was written by Mordecai
himself, and eyewitness and a maine party, according to chap. 9.20. and have
ever reckoned it among the Chetubin or Hagiographa, that is, the Books of holy
Scripture. Indeed, because they find not the name of God or Lord in this whole
Book, they have a custom to cast it to the ground before they read it. But
they need not: for as the Ancient Heathens used to write upon their books
(...), God, God, so might the Jews upon this; Pausan.
there being no where in Scripture found more remarkable passages and acts of
Gods immediate providence for his calamitous people, then in this. Surely
(says a great Divine) like as a man by a chain made up of several linkes,
some of Gold, others of Silver, some of Brass, Iron, or Tin, may be drawn out
of a pit: so (it may here be seen that) the Lord by the concurrence of several
subordinate things which have no manner of dependence or natural coincidence
among themselves, has wonderfully wrought the deliverance of his Church; that
it might appear to be the work of his own hand.

In the days of Ahashuerus] That is of Xerxes, the terror of Greece, called
Ahashuerosh, that is, an hereditary Prince, begotten by King Darius, and borne
of a Kings daughter, viz. Atossa, daughter to Cyrus, and heir of the Kingdom
by lineal descent. Such an hereditary Prince was our Henry the eighth. Vide
Scalig. de Emond. temp. lib. 6. Herod. 1. 7. and 9. Fevardent. Ill loc.
Greek Authors also call Xerxes, Oxyares, and his wife Amestris, which seems
to be the same with Esther, who is called Amestris by a like composition, says
an Interpreter, as Hamans father was called Ham-Adata, an honorable addition
to a name among the Persians.

This is Ahashuerus which reigned from India even unto Aethiopia] Viz.
Inclusive, ut loquuntur. This must needs be Xerxes; for he subdued Ethiopia,
and thereupon made this great feast. He was Lord, we see, of a very great part
of the habitable world; s is now the great Turk, not inferior in greatness
and strength, to the mightiest Monarchs that ever yet were upon the face of the
earth. No part of the world is left untouched by him but America only; Turk.
Hist. 132
not more fortunate, says one, with her rich mines, then in that she is so
far from so great and dangerous an enemy. Nevertheless of all this
greatness ( belluine rather then genuine) what says Luther? Turcicum imperium
quantum quantum est, etc. The Turkish Empire in its utmost extent, is but a
crust cast to his dogs, by the great housekeeper of the world. The inheritance
he reserves for his children: who though held here to strait allowance, yet are
far dearer to him then the worlds greatest darlings; as the poor captive Jews
were, then this great Emperor. Those that seek a mystery in this history tell
us, that Ahashuerosh typically represents God the Father soveraigning over
all Kingdoms and creatures on earth; choosing some to be heirs of heaven, and
purifying them for that purpose. Mardochai (signifying bitter, and contrite)
sets forth Christ, say they, broken for our sins, and suffering the bitter
wrath of God. Esther (being the same with Alma, a pure Virgin, secreted and
secured from defilement) is a lively image of the Church, unspotted of the
world, and provided for by her Mordecai. Esaias 7.14.
The disdainful Vashti (taking her name from Shatha, to drink) is a fit
effigies of the world, proud and luxurious, and therefore excluded heaven.
Haman (signifying a tumultuous and obstreperous person) represents the Devil,
restless and rageful, but to his own utter ruin, etc. These are pretty
things, but not so proper. The Popish Commentatours are full of them.

Over an hundred and seven and twenty Provinces] Seven more then were in Darius
the Mede his time, Dan. 6.1. Monarchs will be still adding; and although a man
were Monarch of the whole world; yea, had the command of Moon, and Stars, yet
would he still be peeping beyond them for more, more. Herodotus reckons up
sundry satrapies under the King of Persia, out of which he received, yearly,
fourteen thousand five hundred and threescore Euboian talents: so that this
Monarchy is fitely compared (in Daniel) to the silver breast and arms in
Nebuchadnezzars image.

Verse 2. When the King Ahashuerus sat on the throne] Having peace with all
men, being quiet and secure; though this lasted not long; for he was shamefully
fo^led by the Grecians (against whom he led an Army of two millions of men) and
forced to fly back again over Hellespont, in a poor fishers-boat; which being
over-burdened, had sunk all, if the Persians by the casting away themselves had
not saved the life of their King. Omnia sunt hominum tenui pondentia file, etc.

Which was in Susan the Palace] See Nehem. 1.1. Ptolomy, Strabe, and Pliny tell
us, that in this City (situate upon the river Choaspes) was that famous Palace
of Cyrus, which was adorned with marble walls, P^ol. l. 6 c. 3. Strab. lib. 15.
Plin. l. 6. c. 27. Herod. l. 5. Athen. l. 12. c. 3
golden pillars, and great store of precious stones; shining as so many stars
from the roof and sides of it, to the dazzling of the eyes of the beholders.
Here it was, likely, that the Kings of Persia sat to hear causes under a vine
of gold, set with smaragds; as with so many clusters of grapes.

Verse 3. In the third year of his reign he made a feast] Such a feast, as
that all other feasts were but hunger to it; whether we regard the number of
guests, the largeness of preparation, or the continuance of time: Yet it had
an end. But so has not the feast of a good conscience. Prove. 15.15. See the
Note there.

Unto all his Princes and his servants] To gratify them for their former
valor and victory; and to inflame them to a new expedition, viz. against
Greece; for the conquest whereof he was now addressing himself: As also that
his glory and wealth appearing herein might make them all the more willing to
live in subjection to him, so royal and munificent a Prince.

The power of Persia] Or to the army of Persia and Media.

The Nobles] Satrapis, (...), of which the word Parthemim is made, as some
think. Others derive it of Perath, quasi principes Euphrataei, Kimchi Arias.
the Princes that were beyond the river Euphrates.

Verse 4. When he showed the riches of his glorious Kingdome] Or, that he might
show, etc. There were other ends of this feast, as was before noted; but this
is instanced by the Holy Ghost, to set forth the pride and vanity of this great
monarch, O curas hominum! o quantum est in rebus inanc!
abusing Gods gifts to his own ambition, and priding himself in that wealth
which had been gotten by the hard labor of his poor subjects; from whom happily
his Exactours had received no less sums of curses then of coin.

And the honor of his excellent majesty] Atqui virtute, non vanitate
acquirenda est gloria, Cic de Orat. and de offic.
says the Orator, glory is to be gotten by virtue, and not by these, like
vanities. Hezekiah smarted for his folly in this kind; Nebuchadnezzar much
more. This great Potentate was shortly after brought low enough.

Desinat elatis quisquam confidere rebus; Claudian.

Magna repent ruunt, summa cadunt subito.
Many days, even an hundred and fourscore dayes] An hundred fourscore and five
days, says Joseph Ben Gorion. So long lasted the first feast: though Lyra
will have it, that so long they were in preparing, but the feasting was not
till after these days expired; and that then both Prince and people were
feasted together seven days. Of the Sybarites indeed we read, that when they
made great feasts, they invited their women a twelve month before, that they
might come the more richly and luxuriously attired, and might be the more
sumptuously entertained. But the text plainly shows, that Lyra here did
delirare, miss the meaning: for after that, the Princes, from sundry parts had
been half a year in feasting.

Verse 5. The King made a feast unto all the people] This was not amiss, so
that care were taken that no irregulares gulares were found amongst them; for
Kings should carry themselves toward their people as kindly as parents do
toward their children, Arist. 8. Eth. Plin. Panegyr. (...). Psalm. 78.70.
and shepherds toward their sheep. Are they not therefore called patres
patriae, Fathers of their Country, and Shepherds of their people? David and
Cyrus were taken from the sheepfolds to feed men.

Both unto great and small] Pell-mell, one with another, to show his
liberality; which yet he might better have bestowed in another way, then in
belly-chear, and such openhouse-keeping to all comers without difference: since
this is rather prodigality then bounty.

Seven dayes] Too long together to be a feasting; since at such times men are so
apt to exceed and out-last; eating that on earth that they must digest in hell;
and drowning both bodies and souls in wine and strong drink, as Richard the
third did his brother Clarence in a Butt of Malmsey.

In the court of the garden] In the banqueting house. or sub dio, in the open
air in the garden, where they had elbow-roome, and all manner of delights, fit
to have been seasoned and allayed with the sight of a sepulcher (the Jews
built their Tombs a forehand in their gardens) or else of a deaths-head (as was
the manner of the Egyptians at their great feasts) to keep them from surfeiting.

Verse 6. Where were white, green and blew hangings] Rich and royal tapestry,
set forth with variety of colors, pleasant to the eye.

Fastened with cords of fine linnen] More precious then silk.

And pillars of marble] To bear up the hangings, that the guests might the
better behold them, and be defended by them from wind, dust, and heat.

The beds] Whereon they sat at meat (which was the manner of all those
Eastern parts) their bodies so composed, as that the upper part thereof being
somewhat bent and bowed, the rest lay along.

Were of gold and silver] The bedsteds were. See Amos 6.4. and 2.8. Jer. 23.41.

Upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble] Or, porphyry or
crystal. Haec sunt quae nos faciunt invitos mori.
All very costly and stately: And these are those things that make us desirous
to live longer here, as Charles the fifth told the Duke of Venice; who had
showed him his fair Palace richly furnished. But what said Nugas the Scythian
Prince to certain Ambassadors who brought him brave and rich presents? Will
these save a man from sickness? Will they stave off death? Do not these
outward gawdes and gayeties carry away the heart from the love and care of
better things? Val Max. Christian.
Solomon says as much in his sacred Retractations: and Charles the fifth (who
besides other Territories and Dominions, had twenty eight Kingdoms)
voluntarily gave over the Empire as a burden; and cursing his honors in his
old age, Mornay.
his trophies, riches, royalties, said to them all, Abite hinc, abite long, Be
gone all of you; get you hence. Abi perdita bestia quae me perdidisti, as
Cornelius Agrippa said on his deathbed, Delrio, Disq. Mag. to. 3. l. 6.
to his familiar Devil, Be packing thou wretched beast, that have undone me for
ever.

Verse 7. And they gave them drink] Think the same of meat also: but the whole
feast has its denomination in the original from drinking; because at such
times they drank freely, Quia in conviviis largiter bibi solet. Corn. Nepos in
vit. Alcibiad. Xenoph Cyrop. lib 8. Athenaeus.
and many times more then did them good. The Persians are infamous for their
intemperancy, though they had Laws to the contrary: and Xenophon tells us that
of old they were otherwise. Only once a year their King had license to be
drunk; viz. when they sacrificed to the Sun.

In vessels of gold] Beset with precious stones (as Josephus adds) ad
delectationem and spectaculum.

The vessels being diverse one from another] To show the Kings store of them,
that there was not curta supellex, but great plenty and variety of dishes and
dainties.

And royal wine] Choice wine, and fit for a Kings palate. Vinum Cos, as they
call it merrily at Lovain and Paris, id est, coloris, oderis, saporis optimi,
of the best color, smell and taste. Beehive of Rome. Pref.


In abundance] They swam in wine, and the tables did even sweat with variety of
dishes: quicquid avium volitabat, quicquid piscium natabat, quicquid ferarum
discurrebat, etc. to use Seneca's expression.

According to the state of the King] For whom it was not unlawful to feast, so
to show his liberality toward his Peers, and courtesy to his people. But that
which was blameworthy in him, was, 1. His vainglory. 2. His prodigality. 3. His
mis-spending of time. 4. Merlin. in loc.
His neglect of business. 5. His contempt of the true God, not once
acknowledged by him or his guests. Lastly, their profane mirth and jollity,
without the least note of sanctity or respect to Gods glory.

Verse 8. And the drinking was according to the Law] Prescribed by the King,
and it was but needful, lest men should make his house a school of
intemperancy: and lest shameful spewing should be on his glory, Habac. 2.16.
And, inasmuch as of evil manners come good Laws, it appears by this Edict of
the King, that the Persians were now degenerated from their ancient sobriety
and moderation in meats and drinks. So likewise were the Cretians when Minos
made a Law that men should not drink one to another, (...), unto drunkenness:
And the same we may well think of the inhabitants of this Land, when King Edgar
made an ordinance for putting pins in cups, to stint men how far they should
drink, and that none should quaffe whole ones.

Quinetiam Spartae mos est laudabilis ille,
Vt bibat arbitrio pocula quisque suo.
None did compell] Domitius the father of Nero slew Liberius an honest Roman,
because he refused to drink so much as he commanded him. Sue^on.
Tiberius for his drunkenness called Caldius Biberius Mero, instead of
Claudius Tiberius Nero) made Novellus Tricongius Proconsul, for that he could
drink three pottles of wine together with one breath. He preferred also L. Piso
to the government of the City of Rome, because he could sit drinking with him
continually for two whole days and nights together. Lyra upon this text
declaimeth against this detestable healthing and carowsing too too common in
all parts of Christendom; and says that it was brought up first by the
Barbarians in Normandy, who came and depopulated that Country. And what a
lamentable thing is it that at this day, in such a State as ours, the civil,
sober, and temperate man shall be urged, and it may be forced to swallow down
needless draughts, as a horse does a drench, by domineering drunkards. The
late good Act against drunkenness, if well executed, will be some curb to our
Roaring-boyes; so they will needs be called by a woeful Prolepsis, Here for
hereafter. Oh that we could persuade such, as Mahomet did his followers, that
in every grape there dwelt a Devil; or, that fire and brimstone, storm and
tempest, this shall be the portion of the Drunkards cup.

For the King had appointed to all the officers of his house] He had appointed,
Heb. he had founded or stablished it for an inviolable Decree; and officers on
purpose (Controulers of his house) to see it executed. John 2.8. we read of a
governor of the feast. The Jews had such Officers or Moderatours at their
merry-meetings (called the Eyes and Overseers of the feast,) that took care
that none should over drink himself. The Latins also had such, Praesecti
morum. (...). Gaudentius. Casaubon. Plautut.
calling them Dictatours. The Greeks had their Symposiarchs; but among these,
their power extended no further then to see that the feasters drank small
draughts only at first, which by degrees they increased till they came to the
height of intemperancy. But these should have considered that which Anacharsis
had told them, that the Vine bears three grapes: The first, of pleasure, the
second of drunkenness, Laert.
and the third of misery and mischief.

That they should do according to every man's pleasure] Drink what they thought
good without stint, or force. It is reported of Romulus, that being once
invited to supper, he drank not much, because he had weighty business to do on
the morrow after. And when one said unto him, Sir, If all men should drink as
you do, wine would be far cheaper: Nay, Nam ego bibi quantum volut. Gell. lib.
11. cap. 14.
it would be dearer, said he, if every man should drink as I have done; that
is, as much as he pleases to drink.

Verse 9. Also Vasthi the Queen made a feast for the women] Heb. A feast, or a
compotation of women. This was better yet, then Heliogabalus his Senate of
women, with their ordinances correspondent; as what attire each woman should
use, how they should take place, when salute, etc. The Romans decreed in Senate
that no women should drink wine. What Vashti's practice was I know not; but, by
her name she should be a Meribibula, a wine-bibber, as was noted, verse 1.

Convenient rebus nomina saepe suis. Josephus, and after him Lyra, give her the
commendation of a modest woman. It Is probable she had the Kings consent to
feast the women, because it was in the royal house: and it added much to the
Kings munificence. But then she should have subdued her husband by obeying of
him, as Livia (as great an Empress) did Augustus. Dio reports of her, that
being asked how she got such a power over her husband? she answered, Multa
modestia, by my much modesty. It is remarkable in this third feast, that,
first, Dio in Tiberio.
the women feasted within doors, not in the open Court, as their husbands did,
and next, apart from the men. Which whether it were of pride, because Vashti
would keep state by her self; or, of necessity, because either the custom of
the Country, or the Kings jealousy would not allow her presence among so many
of the other sex, yet surely this may condemn (as one well says) our most
lascivious mingling of both sexes together in dancing, and such like meetings;
where nothing is more usual then lustful looks, filthy speeches, unclean
touches. Apage omnem hanc impudentiam, shun all occasions of sin that does so
easily beset us. Lot feasting and drinking wine with his own daughters, fell
into the sin of incest. The Israelites doing the like with the daughters of
Moab, were ensnared, and subverted. The dancing damosel so enflamed that old
Goat Herod, that like a mad man he swears to give her her desire to the half
of his Kingdom. In all mixed meetings of both sexes, let the husbands eyes be
eyes of Adamant, which will turn only to one point; lest some Circe enchant
him, having faculty attractive with the Jeat, and retentive with the Adamant.
Let the wives also be like that Persian Lady, who being at the marriage of
Cyrus, and asked how she liked the Bridegroom? How? says she: I know not; I
saw no body but my husband.

Verse 10. On the seventh day] Here we have Luxuriosi convivii luctuosum
exitum, a sad end of a luxurious feast. Sin usually ends tragically. On the
six former days of the feast having farced his body with good cheer like a
wool-sack, and inflamed it with wine wherein was excess, he bethinks himself
of other pleasures: Vina parant animos Veneri. Aristophanes calls wine the
milk of Venus, and fuel of lust. Ovid. (...). Arist. Lib. 1. de poenit. c. 4.
Ambrose says that lust is fed with feasts, nourished with delicacies, kindled
with wine, set on flame with drunkenness. A belly filled with wine foameth out
filthiness, says Hierom.

When the heart of the King was merry with wine] The property whereof is to
exhilarate the heart of man, as the Scripture speaks. Pluto calls wine the
mitigater of man's misery. Euripides says, Qui non hilarescit bibendo, nihil
sapit. Judge. 9.13. Psalm. 104.15. In Cyclope.
But Ahasuerus his heart was over-merry; the wine was so in that the wit was
out: drunkenness had bereft this Polyphemus of his eye of right reason. This
is a vice hateful in all, but in a Ruler most of all. See Prove. 31.4. with the
Note. What mad work made Alexander the Great many times in his drunkenness,
killing those then whom he would afterward have revived, if he could, Plato. ^
with his own heart-blood? Therefore it was that the Carthaginians forbade
their Magistrates all use of wine: Solon punished drunkenness in a Ruler with
death. And Ferdinand the first Emperor of Germany, sharply reproved the
Ambassadors of the Electours and Princes sent to an Imperial Diet, for their
quaffing and careless performance of their trust, Vol. Max. Christ. 397.
saying, Abstinete a maledicta ebrietate, etc. Abstain, for shame, from this
cursed drunkenness, (which is neither good for body nor soul) and look better
to your offices.

He commanded Mehuman] These should have advised him better (for now
drunkenness had robbed him of himself, and laid a fool in his room, wine had
over-shadowed his wisdom, Vino sapientia obumbratur. lib. 23. cap. 1. Lib. 11.
Antiq. cap. 6.
as Pliny phraseth it) and not have been so ready to execute his unreasonable
and illegal commands. For the Persians had a Law ( Josephus says) that Matrons
should not be seen at feasts among men; though Harlots might. But Kings are
never without their Court-Parasites, who will humor them in any thing, and
whose song is, Mihi placet quicquid Regi placet, That which pleases the King,
pleases me, howsoever.

Verse 11. To bring Vasthi the Queen before the King] This was their errand,
and they went readily about it, (though it beseemed not their state, as being
chief about the King) whether they envyed the Queen, and so sought occasion
against her (as the Bishops did against Queen Katharine Parr) or were in the
Kings predicament, and therefore desired fuel to their fire.

With the crown royal] In all her best, that nest of pride, as one calls it,
and incentive of lust.

To show the Princes and the people her beauty] And thereby to show them all
his own imprudence, and impudence: this he would not have done, if sober, for
any good. Herodot. Justin.
Quid non ebriet as designat? Wine is a mocker, and strong drink is raging.
Could he not consider what he had often read befell Candaules King of the Sardians
for showing his fair wife to Gyges in a vainglorious humor? Knew he not that
those wellwhittled Courtiers would easily be enflamed with the sight of such a
peerlesse beauty, and that her gay attire would not make her more comely, then
common?

For she was fair to look on] Xenophon testifies of the Persian and Median
women, that they are proper and beautiful beyond all other Nations. Vasthi, we
must needs think then, (...). Aelian.
was a choice beauty: and if she were (as Aspasia Milesia wife to King Cyrus)
fair and wise, it was no small commendation. But if (as Aurelia Orestilla in
Sallust) she had nothing in her praiseworthy but her beauty; it was ill
bestowed on her. The Jews give a very ill character of her. They say she was
daughter to Belshazzar (that notable quaffer, who might therefore call her
Vasthi, that is, a drinker) that she hated the Jews extremely, and abused
diverse of their daughters (her slaves) making them work on the Sabbath day, and
putting them every day to the basest offices, not affording them rags to hide
their nakedness, etc. This perhap^ is but a Jewish fable.

Verse 12. But the Queen Vashti refused to come at the Kings commandment] She
peremptorily and contumaciously refused, though sent for again and again (as
Josephus has it) by her Lord and husband, who had in his cups boasted of his
wives beauty, courtesy and obedience, (...). Septuag.
whereof he would now make proof to the company, sending for her by such an
honorable convoy: yet, she would not, that she would not, as the Hebrew word
signifies, but carried her self, as if she had been his Mistress, and not his
wife, to his great grief, and the marring of all their mirth. What if the King
were not so well advised? what if he were in his cups? what though she had the
Law on her side, and a pretense of modesty, and lest she could by coming,
occasion the Kings jealousy, etc? Yet Vashti was to have submitted her self
unto her own husband (such an husband especially) as it was fit in the Lord,
Col. 3.18. to yield obedience to all his lawful commands and restraints, seem
they never so unreasonable. If woman were given to man for a comforter, and in
some cases for a Counselor, yet in no case for a Controuler, as they are apt
to be that are fair (fastus inest formae) rich ( argentum accepi, dote imperium
vendidi, says he in Plantus) better descended, etc. si vis nubere, nube pari:
an insolent wife is an unsufferable evil: and he has lost half the comfort of
his life, who is married to such an one.

Therefore was the King very wroth] He even foamed at mouth like a wild-bore,
and froathed as the raging Sea, as the word imports. The Persian Kings were
noted by some for uxorious; such, as though they commanded the whole world,
Captivarum suarum captivi. Plut.
yet were commanded by their wives and concubines: But here it proved
otherwise. This mighty Monarch could not bear such a public affront and scorn
as he construed it; but rages beyond reason (whereof his wine for the time had
bereft him) and resolves upon revenge. How much better our William the
Conqueror, who though he knew that Maud his wife maintained her son Robert
Curtuoise in his quarrel for Normandy, and out of her own coffers paid the
charge of that war against his father, and her own husband, yet because it
proceeded but from a motherly indulgence for advancing her son, Speed. 452.^
he took for a cause rather of displeasure then of hatred. He loved her whilst
alive, often lamented her death with tears, and most honorably interred her.

And his anger burned in him] As Nebuchadnezzar also did upon a like occasion,
hotter then his seven times-heated oven, or then the mountain Aetna does:
Moses his anger waxed hot in him, Exodus 32.19. so that he knew not well what
he did in it; it raised such a smoke. Jonah was ready to burst with anger,
Chapter 4.9. his blood boiled at his heart, as brimstone does at the match:
therefore is the heart set so near the lungs, that when it is heated with
anger, it may be allayed and cooled by the blast and moisture thereof. Josephus
says that he brake off the feast upon this occasion.

Verse 13. Then the King said to the wise-men] What a sudden change is here? Ex
conviviis fiunt comitia, imo and convitia, says an Interpreter: The enraged
King forgets all his old love to Vasthi, and breaths nothing else but
reparation of his own lost honor, and revenge upon his peerless paragon.
Howbeit herein He is to be commended, that he sent not for her forthwith by
force, that he might dispatch her with his own hands; as Alexander did his
friend Clitus and others in his cups and choler: neither ran he raging into her
chamber, Sueton. Ner.
and kicked her out of the world, as Nero did his wife Octavia, for a less
matter. He knew that anger is an evil counselor: -- qui non moderabitur irae,
Horat.

Inf^ctum velit esse dolor quod suaserit and men's.


He that reineth not in his anger shall do that in his haste, whereof it shall
repent him by leisure, and could eat his nails to have it undone again.
Ahashuerus therefore calls for his Judges and Counselors, skilful in
statematters.

Which knew the times] And what was best to be done in them. This skill they
had gotten by much reading of Politics, and Histories, and long observation.
The men of Issachar were such, 1 Chronicles 12.32. Such a one was Croesus to
Cyrus, Polybius to Scipio, Agrippa to Augustus, Anaxagoras to Themistocles,
etc. Xerxes here had seven such to advise with as his Privy-Counsellours,
Judices Regios; the Kings Judges Herodotus calls them, and further says,
Lib. 3.
that they held their places for their lives, unless they very much misbehaved
themselves.

For so was the manner] Sc. to advise with them in matters of moment, but not
always to take their advise. The manner was, and the fundamental Laws of the
Land took order, for prevention of tyranny, that the Kings of Persia should be
ruled by this grave Senate of the Kingdom, and not bring in an arbitrary
government. But Xerxes, (who is this Ahashuerus) once at lest, (if not oftener)
viz. in his expedition against Greece, which was not long after this great
feast, called his seven Princes together, and spoke to them after this manner:
Lest, said he, I should seem to follow mine own counsel, Val. Max, lib! 9.
cap. 5.^
I have assembled you and now do you remember, that it becomes you rather to
obey then advise.

Toward all that knew law and judgement] Of these Persian Privy-Counsellours
it is said, 1. That they were wisemen: now those only are wise quibus res
sapiunt prout sunt. 2. They were skilful in the times, that is, well versed in
histories, and well furnished with experiences. 3. That they knew the Laws,
which they had ready, and at their fingers ends, as we say. They knew also
judgment, that is, equity and moderation, without which utmost right might be
utmost wrong; as indeed it proved in the case in hand. Memucan not only
accuses the Queen, but aggravateth her offense, and instead of healing the
wound, makes it far wider. This might become a mercenary Orator, but not a
grave Counselor. The business was this: The King was angry, and he meant to
set him going: the Queen was an eyesore, and she must be removed. Such slaves
are ambitious statists to their own, and their Princes lusts, but especially
when their own plough is driven forward withal.

Verse 14. And the next unto him was Carshena, etc.] These were his trusty and
welbeloved Cousins, and Counselors, primi and proximi, first in the Kingdom,
and next unto the King, without whom he was to have done no business of
importance. But it is recorded in story that they had no freedom nor liberty
of Council. For every one of them had a plate or tile of gold to stand upon in
the Councel-house: And if he gave counsel that the King thought well of, the
plate of gold was given him for a reward: but if he delivered any thing
contrary to the Kings mind, flagris caedebatur, he was beaten with stripes.
Keckerm. Polit.
Lo this was the manner of the Persian Monarchs.

The seven Princes] See Ezra 7.14.

Which saw the Kings face] That came at pleasure into the presence, as they
call it. It was a piece of the silly glory of these Kings of Persia to secret
themselves from their subjects. No man might see the King (uncalled for) on
pain of death, cum ejus persona sub specie majestatis occuleretur, Lib. 1.
hist.
says Justin. Only these seven might ordinarily take the boldness to see his
face: which lest Haman should do, they covered his face.

And which sat the first in the Kingdome] Xenophon tells us that Cyrus the
first Persian Monarch ordained that the Nobles should sit before the King every
man according to his degree, Cyrop. lib. 8.
and dignity. Aben Ezra upon this text says the same.

Verse 15. What shall we do] Says the King; who changes the scene suddenly,
the banqueting house into a Councel-chamber, the merry-meeting into a most
difficult consultation, what to do with the Queen, and how to repair the Kings
honor so much impaired by her. Esaias 23.9.
How easily can the Lord stain the pride of all glory, cross the worlds
greatest darlings, give an unsavory verdure to their sweetest morsels, and
make their very felicity miserable!

Unto the Queen Vashti] You should determine nothing rashly against her, but
accept of her lawful excuse, hear her plea, remember that she is your
companion, and the wife of your Covenant, (...). A then. lib. 13.
Mal. 2.14. your fellow, and not your footstool; a yoke fellow standing on
even ground with you, though drawing on the left side, etc. This you should do
to the Queen Vashti. But Plutarch notes of the Persians, that they were none
of the kindest husbands, but harsh, and jealous. And Athenaeus says, that the
Kings of Persia lord it over their wives, as if they were their handmaids.

According to Law] This you should do; retain the decency and gravity of the
Law which is never angry with any man ( Lex non irascitur, sed constituit,
says Seneca) no more must those that administer it. The angry man cannot
easily keep a mean. This Archytas the Tarentine knew, and therefore being
displeased with his servants for their sloth, he flang from them, saying,
Farewell, I have nothing to say to you, because I am angry at you.

Because she has not performed the Commandment, etc.] This was a fault no
doubt: but not so heinous as was made of it. The faults of his wife a man must
either tollere or tolerare, cure or cover, and not go about to kill a fly upon
her forehead with a beetle, as they say. But God had a provident hand in it for
the good of his Church.

Verse 16. And Memucan answered before the King] Heb. Mumchan, The Junior
likely, and therefore spoke first the rest concurred, verse 21. A bold man he
was surely (whatever else he was) that durst deliver his mind so freely of
such a business, and in such a presence, etc. What if the King and Queen
should have grown friends again, where had Memucan been? If his cause and his
conscience had been as good as his courage was great, all had been as it ought
to be.

And the Princes] Inter pocula de rebus arduis consultabant, says Herodotus
concerning the Persian Princes. Lib. 1.
In the midst of their cups they use to consult of the greatest affairs. Here
they accuse and uncondemne the Queen heard, and unconvicted, which was against
all Law divine and humane. King Henry the eighth, though a boisterous man,
dealt more civily with his first wife Katharine of Spain, when he had a mind
to rid his hands of her; Her cause was heard before the two Cardinals, Wolsey
and Campaine, ere the Divorce was pronounced, and she sent out of the Kingdom.

Vasthi the Queen has not done wrong to the King only] That she had done wrong
or dealt perversely against the King. He takes for granted: because the Kings
commandment was not obeyed. But was that a sufficient reason? Was the Kings
bare word a Law, or rule of right? and is not a wife in case of sin commanded
by her husband, rather to obey God then men? Or say she had done wrong, must it
needs be out of perverseness? might it not be out of fear, modesty, or for
some other civil reason which she might allege for her self, if called to her
trial? But here you may see (says one) when flattery and malice gives
information, shadows are made substances, and improbabilities necessities; so
deceitful is flattery, malice so unreasonable. And yet herein also the Lord is
exceeding righteous, who meets hereby with other sins of this insolent Queen:
that whereas (no doubt) she was an example of pride and vanity more generally
to other women then she was likely to be in this point, therefore is she hereby
found out in her sin, and by this unlikely accusation, condemned of a true
fault.

But also to all the Princes and to all the people] Against the King she had
offended by her disobedience, against all others by her example. And indeed the
sins of great ones fly far upon those two wing, Scandal and Example; they prove
both patterns and privileges to their inferiors, for the like. Howbeit we must
necessarily distinguish between scandal given, and scandal taken only: neither
may we judge of a thing by the ill consequences that biassed and disaffected
persons can draw from it; there being nothing so well carried, but that it may
be liable to some men's exceptions.

Verse 17. For this deed of the Queen shall come abroad] The least aberration
in a star is soon observed: so the miscarriages of great ones are quickly both
noted and noticed. Public persons are by Plutarch compared to looking-glasses,
according to which others dress themselves: to pictures in a glasse-window,
wherein every blemish is soon seen: to common Wells, which if they be poisoned,
many are destroyed. The common people commonly are like a flock of Cranes: as
the first flies, all follow.

So that they shall despise their husbands] Which indeed ought not to be, no
not in their hearts. Let the wife see that she reverence her husband. Ephesians. 5.
ult.
God has a barren womb for mocking Michal: when Sarah is crowned and
chronicled for this, that she obeyed her husband, calling him Lord. It is here
taken for confessed, that Vasthi despised her husband; and that others would
thereby take heart to do the like, is therehence inferred. But does that
necessarily follow? and must the Queen therefore be presently deposed, yea put
to death, as the Jew-Doctours tell us she was? King Asa deposed his grandmother
Maacha; but that was for Idolatry. Our Henry the eighth beheaded his wife Anne
Bullen, but that was for (supposed, and but supposed) adultery. Queen Elizabeth
narrowly escaped with her life, because she was accused (but falsely) of
conspiracy against the Queen her sister. But what had Vasthi done? Condemned
she is without reprival; and the Country must come in (but was never called)
to give in evidence against her, that happily never saw her, nor heard of her
offense. Is this fair-dealing?

Verse 18. Likewise shall the Ladies of media and Persia say] Say what? We will
not do as our Lords command us. Like enough all this: for their tongues were
their own, and their wills no less. That free will (about which there is so
much ado made) when men once lost, the women caught it up; and hence they are
so wedded to their own will, says one merrily. Quicquid volunt, valde volunt,
what they will do, they will do contra gentes, says another. And for talking
and telling their minds; The Rabbines have a proverb, that ten Kabs (measures)
of speech descended into the world, and the women took away nine of them. These
Ladies of Media and Persia were feasting with the Queen when the King sent for
her, ubi quid factum est? garritur, potitatur, saltitatur, Feverdent. in verse
9.
says an Interpreter, at which time they were chatting, and bibbing, and
dancing, and (when their mirth was marred) they would not spare to speak their
minds, and ease their stomachs, what ever came of it. We read in our own
Chronicles of the Lady de Breuse, that by her railing and intemperate tongue,
she had so exasperated King John (whom she reviled as a tyrant and a murderer)
that he would not be pacified by her strange present (four hundred kine, Speed.
572.
and one bull, all milk-white, except only the ears, which were red) sent unto
the Queen.

Then shall there arise too much contempt and wrath] Contempt on the wives
part, and wrath on the husbands: wives shall slight their husbands, and they
again shall fall foul upon their wives: so that conjugium shall become
conjurgium; and the house they dwell together in, shall be no better then a
fencing-school, wherein the two sexes seem to have met together for nothing but
to play their prizes, and to try masteries. This made Sylla say, I had been
happy, if I had never been married.

Verse 19. If it please the King] Courtier-like; lest he should seem to
prescribe to the King, or to prejudice the rest of the royal Counselors, he
thus modestly prefaceth to his ensuing harsh and hard sentence. He knew well
enough it would please the King at present, in the mind he now was in: and to
prevent any alteration, he moves to have it made sure by an irrevocable Law,
that he might not hereafter be censured for this his immoderate and unmerciful
censure, but be sure to save one howsoever.

Let it be written, says he, among the Laws of the Persians] Which the King
himself could not repeal, Dan. 6.8, 15. but, once passed and registered, they
remained binding for ever. I have read of a people among whom the Laws they
had lasted in force but for three days at utmost. Legem dicimus (...). Plato.
This was a fault in the other extreme. Laws are to be made with due
deliberation, and then to be established, and not altered without very great
reason, as sometimes there is, since Tempora mutentur, nos and mutemur in illis.

That Vasthi come no more before King Ahashuerus] But be absolutely deposed and
divorced. Here was no proportion betwixt the offense and the sentence. This
judgment was like the Laws of Draco: of which Aristotle says, that they were
not worth remembrance, but only for their great severity; as being written not
with black, but with blood.

And let the King give her royal estate unto another The more to vex her.
Surely such an exauthoration of so great a personage, with so great disgrace
and ignominy, could not but be very grievous, yea worse then death. High seats
as they are never but uneasy; so the fall from them must needs be dangerous
and dismal. How well might holy Esther sing with the Virgin Mary, God puts
down the mighty from their thrones, and exalts them of Low degree, Luke 1.52.

Verse 20. And when the Kings Decree that he shall make shall be published] But
why should any such thing be published at all, unless the King be ambitious of
his own utter dishonor? Is there none wiser then other, but that the King must
beray his own nest, tell all the Empire that he was drunk or little better, and
did in his drink determine that against his fair Queen, that he so soon after
repented? He should have done in this case as a man does, that having a secret
sore, clappeth on a plaster, and then covers it with his hand, that it may
stick the faster, work the better. Had Ahashuerosh been wise, the world had
been never the wiser for any thing that Vasthi had done, etc. But Memucan has
some color for his bad counsel, a goodly vail to cast over it.

All the wives shall give to their husbands honour] They shall not dare to do
otherwise, unless they mean to be likewise divorced. But will terror breed
true honor? is soothing right submission? Quem metuunt oderunt, fear makes
hatred; and people honor none (to speak properly) but whom they love
sincerely. Those lordly husbands that domineere over their wives as if they
were their slaves, and carry themselves like lions in their houses, must not
look for any great respect there. This man promised himself great matters when
he thus said, The wives shall give iittenu in the masculine gender, to signify
the wives voluntary subjection and obedience: but that he never had; nor any
other that took the like course. Those husbands that will be honored indeed by
their wives, must give honor to them as to the weaker vessels, as being heirs
together of the grace of life, 1 Pet. 3.7.

Verse 21. And the saying pleased the King] Pity but itching ears should have
clawing Counselors. Memucan was a fit helve for such an hatchet; and his
advise fit lettice for such lips. What marvel that such a smooth Counselor
pleased the King, when as he had before given place to two such bad
Counselors, Wine and Anger?

And the Princes] Who perceived (very likely) by the Kings looks and gestures,
that he was much taken and tickled with Memucans counsel: which they therefore
second and subscribe to. How rare a jewel in a Princes care is a faithful
counselor, that will deliver himself freely, non ad gratiam, sed ad
veritatem; not to please, but to profit. Such a one was Agrippa to Augustus,
Polybius to Scipio, Latimer to Edward the sixth, etc. There is safety in the
multitude of Counselors, modo andeant quae sentiant (as the Orator says) so
they dare speak out, and will not spare to do it. Cic. pro Milone


And the King did according to the word of Memucan] Dicto citius, it was
forthwith done. Vasthi is all on the sudden divorced, and the foolish King
publicly shamed. But all this was of the Lord, that Esther might be advanced,
and the Church relieved. So there was a wheel within a wheel, which the
wicked discern not, nor the Saints consider of. God often wraps himself in a
cloud, and will not be seen till afterward. All Gods dealings will appear
beautiful in their seasons; though for the present we see not the contiguity
and concatenation of one thing with an^^her.

Verse 22. That every man should bear rule in his own house] Aequum sane
edictum, modo moderatum, A righteous Decree, had it been but rightly made use
of, and not abused to tyranny and rough-dealing. Aristotle says, that the
husband ought to have a civil power over his wife, as being her better in
honor, speech, gravity and dignity. Menander and Euripides say the same;
holding it unfit that the hen should crow, that the woman should usurp
authority over the man: this, Nature and Scripture do both condemn. But why
should these Persian Princes at this time send forth such an Edict as this? was
it because this good Law of Nature began to be depraved and obliterated among
them; as it was among the Egyptians, where the Queen is more honored then the
King, and in private houses the wife then the husband, as Diodorus Siculus
reports? Lib. 2. Bibl. c. 2.
Or had they a mind to divulge their own shame, and to tell the world that
they were least masters at home, and must therefore have a law made to force
obedience? Or was it not (lastly) to countenance the Kings rash and unlawful
putting away of his wife, for so light a cause: like as Cambyses their late
King having a mind to marry his own sister, made a Law, that any man should
have liberty to do the like? Whatever it was that moved them to send forth this
Decree, surely there was little need to excite men to use their authority over
their wives; since they are apt enough to do so without bidding. Therefore Saint
Paul after, wives submit your selves unto your own husbands, does not say, Col.
3.19.
and subjoyne, husbands rule over your wivess, but husbands love your wives,
and be not bitter against them.

And that it should be published according to the language of every people]
That so being particularly understood, it might appear more authentical and
weighty; and so take away the hatred from the Lawgivers for the wrong they had
done the Queen. Some render it thus, that he should speak according to the
language of his own people, that is, say they, that each man should keep and
observe the liberty of his own Nation, by commanding his people, and governing
his own family, without any contradiction.

CHAP. II Verse 1. After these things.]
AFter the wine was out, the fuel of his anger spent, and the lust thereof
satisfied. When the wrath of King Ahashuerus was appeased] There is nothing
that a man is more ready to keep then his wrath: therefore the Hebrews put
servare for servare iram, to keep, for, to keep his anger, as Jer. 3.5. Psalm.
103.9. Levit. 19.18. Ahashuerus, by invading Greece, had so incensed them, that
their wrath (...), unappeasable, for they thenceforth hated all Barbarians for
the Persians sake, and forbade them their sacrifices, as they used to do
murtheres. But Ahashuerus his wrath against Vasthi was, after a time, assuaged.

He remembered Vasthi] Not without some remorse, but without all true
repentance. He forsook not his rash anger as a sin; but regrated it for a
time, and laid it asleep, to be raked up again upon as slight an occasion. In
graceless person ns vitia raduntur, non eradicantur: absconduntur saepius, non
exscinduntur, vices may be barbed or benumbed, not mastered and mortified. A
Merchant may part with his goods, and yet not hate them. A man may part with
his sins for self-respects, and yet retain his affection to them as Phaltiel
did to Michal, when he went weeping after her afar off. He may remember his
Vasthi, his bosome-sinnes from which he seems divorced; and by such a sinful
remembering of them, recommit them. See Ezekiel. 23.21. compared with verse 8.

And what was decreed against her] But whose fault was that? Wine and anger are
the worst of all counselors, say the Ancients? and Ahasuerus found it so: as
did also Alexander the great, Plutarch.
and many others, but all too late. Hence they came in afterward with their
Non putaram, Had I wist; which Scipio said should never be heard out of a great
man's mouth. Augustus also was wont to say, that nothing does so ill become a
Commander, Sueton.
as hastiness and rashness. Tully taxes him for a fool, qui cundem and
laedit and laudat, who first wrongeth a man, and then commends him.

Verse 2. Then said the Kings serva^^s] His friends, says Josephus, to whom he
had opened his mind: the young Courtiers, say others (green wood is ever
shrinking and warping) but most probably those seven chief Counselors, chap.
1.14. who had persuaded him to cast off Vasthi, and now feared, left if not
some way diverted, he should fall as foul upon them, as his predecessor Darius
did upon those claw-backs, Dan. 6.24. or as the Athenians did upon Timagoras,
Densagoras, and Euagoras, whom they condemned to die, for flattering Darius
Hystaspes, the father of this Ahasuerus.

Let there be fair young Virgins sought for the King] They knew him to be a
sensualist and effeminate: they therefore agree to feed his humor, to drown
him again in pleasure, so to drive away his melancholy. Such miserable
comforts are carnal Physicians: so wretched is our nature, to endure no other
Physic: so justly does God fit the Physician to the Patient, the helve to the
hatchet: so do the wicked help each other forward to their deserved
destruction. Ahasuorus his Courtiers and Counselors become Brokers to his
lusts: neither is this any thing unusual with such. Lenocinantur, produnt,
blasphemant, pejerant, toxica miscent, etc. says an Expositor here. What is it
that such Parasites and Sycophants will not do to ingratiate with great ones?
It was not therefore without good cause, that the Primitive Christians prayed
hard for the Emperor (as Tertullian testineth) that God would send him Senatum
fid^lem, a faithful Council, and free him from flatterers.

Verse 3. And let the King appoint officers] Praeficiat praefectos. Costly
counsel: this could not be done without much trouble and charge to the King.
Two or three years are spent in gathering, purifying, and preparing these
choice Virgins for the impure bed of this Heathen Prince, while he is following
the chase of his ambition, in the wars of Greece.

In all the Provinces of his Kingdome] A large Commission they must have, the
whole Kingdom is their circuit: and note that they went not to forreiners:
which those Princes that do, while thereby they seek for greatness, they many
times miss of goodness: while they labor to be strong abroad (and so to have
a stake in store, as they say, however the dice chance to turn) they weaken
themselves at home; and while by foreign matcher they intend unity, it proves
an occasion both of intestine and foreign dissentions. We of this Nation have
had sad experience of these mischiefs.

That they may gather together] This could not be done without the great grief
and general discontent of the Kings best subjects ( nimium serviliter huic
hirco subjectorum, as one has it) thus bereft and despoyled of their dearest
daughters, the staves of their age.

All the fair young Virgins] Beauty (the best pearl in a carnal eye) is all
that is here looked after, que plerunqut virtute and pudicitia caret, which is
often without virtue, and common honesty; as, where they meet, it is a rare
mixture. The Heathen man says, Non est formosa mulier cujus crus laudatur aut
brachium, sed illa cujus universa facies admir ationem sing ulis partibus
abstulit. Now if this be true, long enough might these commissionated officers
look for fair young Virgins, truly so called; there being very few that are not
peccant in some minnum, some tittle of beauty, or other. It is a praise
peculiar to the Vingin daughter of Zion to be all fair, Cant. 4.7. to be (...)
Ephesians. 5.26. such as in whom even Momus himself could sinde no error.

Vtno Shushan the palace] In which one place there might have been found choice
enough, without speaking further: but that lust is unsatisfiable. The eye is
not satisfied with seeing; and in such a multitude, how could it be but that
the Kings mind must needs be distracted, which one to make choice of?

To the house of the women] Such as is now the Turks Serag^^. See the
description of the Grand Signiors Seraglio by Master John Grennes, chap 4.

Unto the custody of Hege] Who was their keeper, or rather their Jailer. For
what was this house of women, but a perpetual prison to them, clapped under
hatches, as it were, and, happily, held in as great servitude, as those in
Barbary are at this day; Heyl. Geog.
where it is death for any man to see one of the Xeriffes concubines; and for
them too, if when they see a man, though but through a casement, they do not
suddenly screek out.

And let their things for purification] (...), Their Abstersories, to dry up
the filth of the flesh, and to cleanse natures infirmities, that they might be
six months purified with oil of myrre, and six other months perfumed with
sweet odours, as verse 12. Here the maids were first purified before the King
chose one. But Christ first chooses his Spouse, and then purifieth her, Ephesians.
5.26.

Verse 4. And let the maiden] Herein unhappy that the got her honor with the
loss of her honesty: and that so many maids are made miserable for her sake.

That pleases the King] Heb. That is good in his eyes. The eye is the lamp and
ornament of the whole body: and yet that most lightsome part does oft-times
draw the soul into utter darkness; whilst by those windows of wickedness,
and loop-holes of lust, Satan windeth himself into the heart, and makes it
impudicitiae cloacam (as Venus's temple on the top of Lebanon is called by
Eusebius) a very sink, and jakes of all lewdness and abomination.

Be Queen instead of Vasthi] This was held a great business, and a sufficient
recompense. The bramble held it a goodly thing to reign over the trees; Judge.
9.
not so the vine and fig tree.

And the thing pleased the King] Because it added more fuel to the fire of his
lust, and that he may lengthen out his days in dalliance and wantonness: ut
libidine libidinem provocante, nihil nisi muliebris fiat, says an Expositour
here, Feuardent.
that he might be the right successor of Sardanapalus, who buried himself in
the bosoms of his harlots, and left behind him this infamous Epitaph.

(...)
(...).
An Epitaph sit for an ox, says Aristotle. The Kings of Persia are noted for
effeminate, fitter for a Canopy then a Camp; and affecting such sights, ^bi
Imperator Apparator, lanx phalanx, acies facies, bella labella, spicula pocula,
scutum scortum, etc.

And he did so] According to the counsel of those Court-parasites (whose word
is that of Stratocles, Mihi placet quicquid Regi placet) he walked in the ways
of his heart, and in the sight of his eyes, Plut. in vit. Demetr.
little thinking that for all these things God would bring him into judgment.
But such Governors the wicked world deserves, Eccles. 11.9.
as being it self totus in maligno positus, 1 John 5. When Phoc^s, that filthy
traitor, reigned at Constantinople, Cedrinus says, that a certain honest
poor man was very earnest with God to know why such a man (or rather monster)
was set up; he was answered again by a voice, that there could not be a worse
man found; and that the sins of Christians did require it.

Verse 5. Now in Shushan the palace] Not in Babylon, as Josephus doateth.

There was a certain Jew] That had not returned to Jerusalem, as he ought to
have done; and as another of his name did, Ezra. 2.2.

Whose name was Merdccai] That is, Pure Myrre, say some; bitter contrition, say
others; he is the son of contrition, that must be the son of consolation. This
Mordecai was one of those few that both lived and died with glory; being not
taxed for any gross sin.

The son of Jair] Happy father in such a son: much more joy might he well
be to his parents, then Epamiuondas was to his: and of him it might be sung,
(...). Homer.


The son of Shimei, the son of Kish a Benjamite] He descended then either
from some other son of Kish the father of Saul; or esse from Jonathan Saul's
son: for he only, of all the sons of Saul, left issue behind him. But the
Kish here mentioned, though of his line, lived many years after Saul's father.

Verse 6. Who had been carried away from Jerusalem] Kish ^ad, not Mordeca^:
unless it were in the loins of his great grandfather. Kish and his posterity
were of those goods figs mentioned in Jeremy: but goodness is no target
against affliction.

-- nec te tua plurima Penthen
Labentem texit pietas. Virg.

With the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah] The good figs
were carried away at the same time with the bad; but in several baskets, Jer.
34.1. Kish and others like him, as Daniel, Ezekiel, Shadrach, Meshack and
Abednego, etc. were not only good men, but very good, like the figs that are
first ripe, Jer. 24.2. such as Gods soul desires, Mic. 7.1. and yet they were
carried away with Jeconiah and the rest that were naught, stark naught, Jer.
24.2. The best may have their share in a common calamity: but God will not
fail even then to set his eyes upon them for good, Jer. 24.6. The husbandman
cutteth down his corn and weeds together, but for different purpose.
Excellently Austin, Vna eademque vis irruens bonos probat, purificat, eliquat;
malos damnat, vastat, exterminat: One and the same common calamity proves, De
Civit. Dei. lib, 1. cap. 8.
melts, purifieth the good; damneth, wastes, destroys the evil: these have
an evil, an only evil, Ezekiel. 7.5. without mixture of mercy; and that because
they are naught, very naught, figs that cannot be eaten, they are so naught,
Jer. 24.2.

Whom Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon had carried away] Lo here the rod in Gods
hand for the chastisement of his children; that being chastened of the Lord,
they may not be condemned with the world, 1 Cor. 11.32. This rod when he had
worn to the stumps, he cast into the fire.

Verse 7. And he brought up] He both nourished and nurtured her in the true
Religion and admonition of the Lord, Ephesians. 6.4. he was her foster-father, and
her Instructor.

Hadassah] Not the same with Atossa, as Tremellius would have it. Hadassah was
the name given her by her parents, and it signifies a Myrtle-tree, which
loves to grow in a bottom; whence the Church is compared to it for her
lowly-mindednesse, Zech. 1.8. Herod. lib. 7 Scalig.
See the Note there.

That is Esther] This was her Persian name, say some; In Heathen histories, she
is called Amestris.

His uncles daughter] Not his brothers daughter, as the Vulgar rendereth it,
after Josephus, and Aben-Ezra. She was his cousin-german, and this was one
reason that moved him to adopt her, viz. the bond of nature.

For she had neither father nor mother] A poor Orphan she was: but Christ left
her not comfortless, John 14.18. He had provided and enabled Mordecai to feed
her and breed her: to train her up in the fear of God, and to defend her
chastity from the rage of lust; besides that her head was by him destined to a
Diadem: Esther the captive shall be Esther the Queen: Esther the fatherless
and motherlesse, shall be a nursing mother to the Church; and mean while meet
with a merciful Guardian Mordecai. Why then should we not trust God with our
selves and our children?

And the maid was fair and beautiful] See the Note on verse 3. Gratior est
pulchro, etc. For her beauty she was brought to the King; and not without some
respect to this it was, that she was bred up by Mordecai. This beauty was a
privilege of nature: and because of the forcible battery that would be laid to
it, God gives her a Guardian. Esther was now in the flower of her age, and her
beauty was the flower of her virtue, as Chrysippus called it.

Whom Mordecai when her father and mother were dead] And so the might have been
put to seek her bread in desolate places, being left to the wide world, as they
say; but the Lord was her rereward, Esaias 58.8. he took her up, Psalm. 27.10. as
the gathering army, or rear-guard did the lame feeble and sick Israelites,
Josh. 6.9. In the Civil Law, provision is made for Orphans, and such as were
cast out; some Hospitals to entertain them, some liberties to comfort and
compensate their troubles. Amongst us also (besides harbors and Hospitals for
such, to the great commendation of the Founders) very good provision is made by
the Laws, and many lives thereby preserved. God often professes himself the
pupill's Patron: gives great charge to all, not to hurt them; and menaceth the
Jews for their hardheartednesse toward them. Let therefore the dying parents
of such (though they have as little to leave them as Esthers had) cast them by
faith into Gods everlasting arms, who has charged his Angels with them, and
has promised heaven to them; commanding his best creatures to cater for them,
Hos. 2.21, 22.

Took for his own daughter] He hid not his eyes from his own flesh, Es^y 58.
as some unnatural Ostrich, or Sea Monster: he made not, as many do, tuition a
broker for private gain; he made not instead of a daughter a slave, or sponge
of his pupil: he devoured her not under pretense of devotion; but freely took
her for his child, and bred her in the best manner. Now the Jews at this very
day account a child's Tutour or Monitour worthy of more respect then his father;
for he, say they, has given him only his being, Leo. Mod.
but the other his well-being.

Verse 8. When the Kings commandment and decree was heard] Percrebuisset: his
officers (herein over-officious) had soon set it abroad, and put it in
execution: the Persians also ( homines ad servitut ens paxati, as Tiberius said
of the Romans) those servile souls, deny not to prostitute their daughters,
but proffer them rather, and hold them happy if they may be admitted. Not so
Mordecai and his Esther Vis major eam abstulit. She was carried away by force,
it is like or if otherwise, it might be a fault in her and her Guardian; unless
we shall say they did it by an extraordinary instinct. Probably there was a sad
parting and many prayers put up by them both for divine direction and
protection; and they were heard accordingly.

And when many maidens were gathered together] Four hundred, Lib. 11. cap. 6.
says Josephus. Sed quid attinebat tot puellas huic cani constuprandas
offerre? says Feuardentius, Plin. lib.
why should this dog deflour so many maidens? Proculus Caesar boasted that in
fifteen days space he got with child twenty Virgins: a fair commendation.

Unto Shushan the palace] Answerable to the Seraglio, where those that are kept
up for their beauties, are all young Virgins taken and stolen from foreign
Nations; where after they have been instructed in good behavior, and can play
upon instruments, sing, dance, and sew curiously, they are given to the Grand
Signior as presents of great value. They live just as Nuns do in great
Nunneries, etc.

That Esther was brought also] In the general survey, she was taken among the
rest and brought to the Court; an ill air for Piety to breath in. -- exeat
aula Qui vult esse pius. Fraus sublimi regnat in aulz. Sen.
But necessity is an hard weapon. As the Turks at this day, so the Persian
Kings then, took all their subjects to be their slaves, holding not only their
estates, but their lives and all they have, at their dispose, without respect
either to the cause or manner.

To the custody of Hegai keeper of the women] Clapped up as it were, in a
glorious prison, being not to come abroad but when the King calls, nor to
frequent any society, but such as is appointed her for her necessary attendance
and comfort. See the like in the description of the Grand Signiors Seraglio,
chap. 4.

Verse 9. And the maiden pleased him] Hegai cast his favor upon her; not
because she was the fairest, noblest, most industrious, most courtly, etc. but
because God wrought his heart to it; as he did Potiphars and Pharaohs to
Joseph, Jonathans to David, Darius's to Daniel, etc. It is the Lord that gives
favor, and fashioneth men's opinions of us. He gave Solomon honor: and Paul
prays to him, that his service may be accepted of the Saints, Row. 15.31.

And she obtained kindness of him] His favor was not empty favor,
professional only, as that of Courtiers.

And he speedily gave her, etc.] As resolving shortly to recommend her to the
King, who, he knew, would be much ruled by him in his choice. Here were shadows
of many excellent virtues in a blind Ethnik; who may in some sort teach true
kindness, and does condemn those that boast of false liberality. He dealt not
basely, but bountifully with Esther.

Her things for purification] See ver. 3.12.

With such things as belonged to her] Heb. Her portions or allowances of food,
raiment, etc. which this faithful officer interverted not for his own private
gain, but rather enlarged himself in the true bestowing thereof.

And seven maidens] When he might have put her off with one: he enlarges
himself, and even stretches his authority, that he might by these maid of
honor attending her, set her forth as a Queen aforehand.

Which were meet to he given her] Or, which were very comely, speciosa, vel
spectatae.

And he preferred] Heb. He changed her? sc. for the better, as God does his
people, when he takes them to heaven, where they change place, but not company
(as that good man said upon his deathbed) and are brought from the jaws of
death, to the joys of eternal life; from shadows to substances, D. Preston.
from misery to majesty, etc. a greater change then that of Queen Elizabeth,
from a Prisoner to a Princess; or that of our Henry the fourth, Dan. hist. 48.
who was crowned the very same day that the year before he had been banished
the Realm. The Latins call prosperous things Res secundas, because they are
to be had hereafter; they are not the first things.

Unto the best place of the house of the women] Or, Unto the best condition.
Gods best children shall have the best of the best, fat things full of marrow,
wines on the lees well refined, Esaias 25.6, Jacob and his family had the best of
the Land of Egypt, that Granary of the world, as one calls it. His posterity
had a land that flowed with milk and honey. What Countries comparable to those
that profess the Gospel? Godliness is profitable to all things, having the
promises of both lives, etc.

Verse 10. Esther had not showed her people] Because the Jews were slighted as
captives, and forlorn (how dear to the gods that Nation is, faith Cicero, it
appears, quod est victa, quod elocata, O at. pro L. Hac.
quod servata, in that they are conquered, captivated, and not utterly
destroyed by us) they were also generally hated, as different in Religion, and
would not so much as drink with Heathens, lest they should drink things
sacrificed to Idols. They held it meritorious (in aftertimes) to kill an
idolater, as Tacitus testifies: and at this day they say, Optimus inter
gentes, etc. The very best among the Gentiles is worthy to have his head
bruised as a Serpent. A nasty people they are still, and bloodthirsty, odious
and sordid. An historian tells us of an Emperor traveling into Egypt, and
there meeting with certain Jews, he was so annoyed with the stench of them,
that he cried out, O Marcomanut, o Quadi, o Surmaetae, tandem alios vobis
deteriores inveni. Ammian. lib. 2.
This is the basest and most contemptible people that ever I light upon. Aug.
in Psalm. 58
The Romans would not own them (when they had conquered them) as they did
other Nations, though they complied never so much, and were their servants. The
Turks so hate them for crucifying Christ, that they use to say in detestation
of a thing, Heyl. Geog.
I would I might die a Jew then: as when they would assure any thing, in
execrationibus dicunt Judeus sim, si fallo, they curse themselves, Sanctrus in
Zech 8.13.
and say, Let me be held a Jew, if I deceive thee. This lies upon them as a
punishment for their unexpiable guilt in putting to death the Lord of life. But
in Esthers time they were hated chiefly for their Religion. In prudence
therefore she concealeth her kindred, as being not called to give an account of
her faith; and living private, might well perform her devotions, and yet not
thrust her self into observation.

For Mordecai had charged be^ that she should not show it] Lest she should be
cashiered the Court for a Jewe^se, which was then held crime enough, as
afterward it was in Nore's days, to be a Christian; and this hand perinde in
crimine, quam odio humani generis, as Tavitus has it, not for any great fault
so much, as by the hatred of mankind, incensed and set on work by the Devil
(doubtless) to root out the true Religion, and to set up himself in the hearts
of men as god of this present world. Hence those complaints of Tertullian and
Justin Martyr in their Apologies for Christians, that their name (and not their
crimes) was hated and hissed out of all companies. Tert. Apo^. c 1. 2.3. Just.
Apol. 2.
Odio publico est confessio nominis, non examinatio criminis. -- Solius hominis
crimen est, etc. Wisely therefore did Mordecai charge Esther to conceal her
self for present; so long as it might be done without prejudice to the truth,
and scandal to her profession. Worthily also did holy Esther in obeying
Mord^cai her faithful foster-father, in ruling her tongue that unruly member:
and in that although she had changed her keeper, yet she had not let go her
integrity, but held with that good woman in Hierome, who cried out, Non ideo
fateri volo, ne peream: sed ideo me^riri nelo, ne peccem.

Verse 11. And Mordecai walked every day] What marvel that Esther was so
morigerous to Mordecai, when he was so solicitous of her welfare? These mutual
respects draw (...) one another. The Centurion in the Gospel had dutiful
servants (Do this, said he, and they did it) for he was a most hind Master,
and minded their good.

Before the court of the women's house] The Turks wonder to see a man walk to
and fro, Biddulph. lib. 3. cap. 5.
and use to ask such an one what he means? and whether he be out of his way,
or out of his wi^s? But the Persians and Greeks were great walkers. Jesus also
walked in Solomon's porch, John 10.23. etc.

To know how Esther di^] Heb. The peace of Esther. Omnis in Ascanio, etc. Virg.
He had taken her for his child, and was curious of her welfare, though she
were now grown up, and preferred at Court. The Court he knew, was an ill air
for godliness to breath in. His care was therefore that she might have Gaius's
prosperity, even mentem s^^am in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body.
And although he trusted God with his Niece, yet he knew that an honest care of
her might well stand with faith in Gods providence. God must be trusted, but
not tempted, by the neglect of lawful means, Matthew. 4.7.

Verse 12. Now when every maids turn was come] Their turns then they took,
and held it their happiness to lose that which was their honor. See 1 Thessalonians.
4.4. with the Note: their bodies were first adulterated, and then vitiated.
This was abominable.

After that she had been twelve moneths] Time spent without spare, and woefully
wasted in making provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof: which the
Prophet Amos rightly calls a thing of naught, Chap. 6.13. with 4, 5, 6. Is
time no better worth then to be thus rioted out in vanity? does not eternity
depend upon it, even the heaviest weights upon the weakest wires? It is
therefore a good rule that one gives, Corrige praeteritum, rege praesens,
cerne futurum.

According to the manner of the women] Who of themselves are apt enough
(without an order to do so, as here) to cast away too much time and cost in
tricking and trimming their bodies (those painted sheaths) as the Comedians
have tartly taxed them; Negotu quantum in muliere una est! says Plautus. What
a deal of do is there with one woman in this kind! And Nosti mores mulierum,
says Terence; du^^ moliuntur, dum comuntur, annus est. And as for the Persian
women, Lib. 12. cap. 1.
Aelian says that they were above all others most addicted to this vanity: and
yet the haughty daughters of Zion are deeply censured, and heavily threatened,
Esaias 3.18. where the Prophet gives us an Inventory of those Ladies gallantry,
and tells them that their finenesse shall be turned into filthiness, their
neatness become nastinesse.

For so were the days of their purification accomplished] What strange
preparation was here for the impure bed of an Heathen? Every Virgin must be six
months purified, and six months perfumed. O God, says one, what care and
cost is requisite to that soul which should be addressed a fit bride for thy
holy and glorious Majesty?

To wit, six months with oil of myrrhe] To cleanse them, and to clear up
their countenances. Plin. 1.13 c. 1. and l.12. c. 15, 16


And six months with sweet odours] Of these there is a lawful use, (why else
were they created?) to please the sense, refresh the spirits, comfort the
brain, etc. But the excess and abuse of them is utterly unlawful, and was
justly punished in Darius the last Persian Monarch, and Muleasses King of
Tunes, who so far affected sweet odours, that he could not be without them
whiles he was in the field against his enemy. Hereby it came to pass, that
being overcome in battle by his own son Amidas (another Absalom) and pursued
among the rest that fled, Ba^th Exner. page 245.
he was discovered and known who he was by the perfumes that he had about him,
though to prevent it he had besmeared himself with blood and dust. Martial
writing to his sweet friend, says, Posthume, non been olet, qui been semper
olet.

And another says, That woman smells best which smells of nothing. Spiret
autem foemina Christum, says Clemen Alexandrinus, Let women learn and labor
to smell of Christ who is the royal Unction, and let them ever he anointed with
chastity, Padag. lib 2. cap. 8.
that chiefest ointment.

And with other things for the purifying of women] Here was no end of excess,
and of expense: and all to satisfy the lust of this impure Prince. Silver is
lavished out of the bag, and much wealth cast away upon these Minions, who had
nothing else to do but to exercise their wits in devising ornaments and
artifices, Hac in collum, hac in crines. Oras. 5. in Verts
whereby they might get the Kings favor, and artaine to the Queendome. Tully
tells us that it was ordinary with the Kings of Persia to bestow upon their
women such a City to buy them bracelets, and such a City for head-tires, etc.
This was luxus plane monstrosissi^us and prodigalissi^^, as one says, most
prodigious and prodigal luxury. So eagerly are the wicked bent upon the
satisfying of their lusts, that they care not what cost they cast away upon
them. Ask me never so much dowry, says that Amouretto, Genesis 34.11, 12. Judah
let go his signet, bracelets, and staff, to the Harlot. Josephus reports of
one Decius Mundus ( Immundus rather) a Nobleman that to one Paulina, Lib. 18.
cap. 4.
a Lady in Rome, he offered as much as came to six thousand pounds to satisfy
his lusts but one night, and yet he could not bring her to his lure by such a
large offer: though afterward (under the mask of Anubis, to which dogs-head
she was devoted) he found means to abuse her: which was the destruction both of
those bawdy Priests, and their Temple.

Verse 13. Then thus came every maiden to the King] Tirus prepared, anointed,
appointed, etc. rejoicing in that whereof they had reason rather to repent; as
too many do now adays, whilst they go dancing to hell in their bolts.

Whatsoever she desired was given her] Omne quod dicebat, was but ask and have:
so lavish is lust; and so foolish are men to bestow cost upon so hard a
reckoning.

Unto the Kings house] Ad regis cubiculum, says the old Interpreter to the
Kings bedchamber.

Verse 14. In the evening she went] As the fittest time for a work of darkness.

And on the morrow she returned] So short is the pleasure of sin. Laeta
venire Venus, tristis abire solet.

Into the second house of the women] That having made sale of her honesty, she
might converse with such as had likewise left their honesties behind them;
companions in evil, and miserable comforters, with whom they might make up
their measure, and God power on his.

She came in unto the King no more] But must burn in lust, without means of
allayment; being scalded, as it were, in her own grease, frying within, and
freezing without. Sed (...), as Cyril says in a like case, We do but rake a
dughill in a discourse of this nature. Merlin.
Let us therefore stay here no longer (as an Interpreter has it) in setting
forth the filthiness of this Heathen Prince, who yet has too many amongst us
that imitate his uncleanness, and intemperance.

Verse 15. Now when the turn of Esther, etc.] Then, and not till then. So when
Joseph was sufficiently humbled, Psalm. 105.20.
the King sent and loosed him; the Ruler of the people let him go free. When
David was become weaned from the world, as a child from the breasts; when his
heart was not haughty, nor his eyes lofty, etc. then was he advanced to the
Kingdom, Psalm. 131.1, He that believes makes not haste. Gods time is best:
and as he seldom comes at our time, so he never fails at his own.

The daughter of Abihail] The seed of the righteous, and so an heiresse of that
precious promise, His seed shall be mighty upon earth, Psalm. 111. She was also
a daughter of Israel, and therefore Gods firstborn, higher then the Kings of
the earth, Psalm 84.27.

Who had taken her for his daughter] This good work was so well pleasing to
God, that it is once again recited, and honorably mentioned. What shall the
Lord Christ then do at the last day for his people who are full of mercy and
good fruits? If now he does not only make mention of us, but mediation for us
at the throne of glory; surely then he will much more make our faith which
works by love, to be found unto praise, and honor, and glory, 1 Pet. 1.7.

She required nothing] As other maids had done to set out their beauty; but
contenting her self with her native comeliness, and that wisdom that made her
face to shine: she humbly takes what Hegai directed her to, and wholly rests
upon the Divine providence.

And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all] By her comely countenance and
gracious deportment. Plutarch speaks of a Spartan woman, that when her
neighbors were showing their apparel and jewels, she brought out her children
virtuous and well taught, saying, These are my ornaments and accoustrements.
Esther did the like by her virtues, which drew all hearts unto her; like as
fair flowers in the spring do the passengers eyes. She had decked her self with
the white of simplicity, with the red of modesty, with the silk of piety, with
the satin of sanctity, with the purple of chastity, as Tertullian expresses
it: taliter pigmentatae Deum habebitis amatorem, says he, and being thus
adorned and beautified, Tert^de cult. scem.
women shall have God himself to be their suitor, and all godly men their
admirers. Whereas on the otherside, Nequaquam ornata est been, quae morata est
male.
Pulchrum ornatum turpes mores pejus coeno collinunt. Plaut. M stell. Act. 1.
Scen. 3.



Verse 16. So Esther was taken unto King Ahashuerus] And so that sweet Promise
was fulfilled and exemplified in her, Though ye have lien among the pots, yet
shall ye be as the wings of a Dove covered with silver, and her feathers with
yellow gold, Psalm. 68.13. God raised up this poor Orphane, this despicable
exile out of the dust, and lifted this needy one out of the dunghill, that he
may set her with Princes, even with the Princes of the people, Psalm. 113.7, 8.
Thus he raised Moses and Joseph, David and Daniel, etc.

Into his House-royal] A place of rest and honor. Thus Flebile principium
melior fort^na secuta est.

In the tenth moneth] Not in the twelfth month, as Josephus has it falsely:
and yet the Papists tell us, that the common people may well want the
historical part of the Bible, and for it read Josephus his Jewish Antiquities.
Barclai.


In the seventh year of his reigne] Four or five years before Hamans
advancement: this was a sweet Providence, that God should set up one to be a
deliverer to his Church, so long before the danger grew on. So Joseph was sent
down to Egypt before: Moses was skilled in all the learning of the Egyptians,
and afterward sent to Midian that he might be fitted to be King in Jeshurun,
etc. Oh how unsearchable are Gods judgments, and his ways past finding out! Oh
the depth, etc! Latimers three last Petitions were granted.

Verse 17. And the King loved Esther] This was the Lords own work, who regarded
the low estate of his Handmaid, and framed the Kings heart to affect her. Luke
1.48.
Let all such maids as desire loving husbands, and all such wives as would have
their husbands loyal and loving to them, get Gods favor, and adorn themselves
with humility and modesty, as Esther did. Let Christian husbands also learn
(for shame) of this barbarian, to love their wives above all women, with a
conjugal, chaste and fast affection; not lusting and hankering after strange
flesh. It Is remarkable, that after Solomon had said, Rejoice in the wife of thy
youth, -- be thou ravished always with her love; he subjoyneth, And why will thou my son be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a
stranger? Prove. 5.19, 20.

She obtained grace and favor in his sight] Surely as meat pleases better in
a clean dish, so virtue in comely persons in more amiable, says Hugo. Beauty
of it self is a greater commendation, says Aristotle, then all letters
testimonial.

So that he set the royal Crown upon her head] For Queens also had their
Crowns, and did shine with the beams of their husbands; saying, as once those
Roman Ladies, Vbi tu Caius, ibi ego Caia, wheresoever thou art King, I also am
Queen. Severus here says, that the King clothed Esther with a purple robe, to
show, that he shared the Kingdom with her, but the text holds forth no such
matter: Indeed he made her Queen in stead of Vasthi, he made also a great
wedding feast, and gave a release to the Provinces, and gifts to his Grandees,
as it follows.

Verse 18. Then the King made a great feast] Feasts are never more in season,
then at the recovery of the lost rib. See the note on Genesis 29.22.

Unto all his Princes and his servants] So did Mauritius the Emperor of
Greece, Niceph. l. 18. c. 8.
when he married Constantina; and Henry the third Emperor of Germany, when he
married Agnes, daughter to the Prince of Pictavia, at Ingelheim. Whither when a
great sort of Players, Fiddlers, Jesters and Juglers resorted, Funcc. ^d annum
1044.
he not only sent them away without reward, but also without meat and drink,
which he liberally bestowed upon the poor.

Even Esthers feast] So he called it, to testify his great affection and
respect toward his Spouse. This is no warrant for that Popish custom, of
dedicating feasts to the honor of Saints; or for that heathenish practice, in
some places amongst us, of keeping Wakes.

And he made a release to the Provinces] That is, he caused it to be kept
Holiday, as Josephus has it. Or rather he granted to his subjects a
relaxation, on feeed me from their taxes, tributes and public payments, for a
time at least, that thereby the New Queen might get favor and authority
amongst them, and all men might wish them much joy and happiness, that the
loins of the people might bless their Prince and his marriage for this
breathing and intermission; when as formerly his Exactours received from his
subjects no less sums of curses then of coin, to maintain his luxury.

And gave gifts] Such as Xenophon reckons up, bracelets, chains of gold,
garments, horses with rich trappings, Cyr^sal. l. 8.
dishes from his own table, etc. This was Kingly, this was god-like, (...).
James 1.5. His son Artaxerxes Longimanus was wont to say, that he had
therefore one hand longer then another, that he might be readier to give then
to receive. Of Cyrus it is said, (...). Xenoph. Bonsin.
that he took more content in giving then receiving. Of Steven King of Hungary,
and of Oswald King of England, that their right hands rotted not off, a long
while after they were dead, because often stretched out in giving gifts, and
dealing alms. Christ received that he might give, Psalm. 68.18. Ephesians. 4.8. And
held it more blessed to give then to receive, Acts 20.35. Be wise now
therefore, O ye Kings, etc. by your bounty and liberality the people shall be
obliged, the State fenced, virtue encouraged, misery relieved, that you have
secured. For, Extra for tunam est quicquid donatur amicis Mar^ial.

Q^as dederis solas, semper habebis opes.


According to the state of the King] Not pinchingly and sparingly, but
bountifully, and as became a King: as Alexander the Great, when he sent his
Tutour a ship full of frankincense: and when a poor man asked him for an alms,
he gave him a City, which when the poor man started at and made strange of,
Alexander said unto him, Non quaero quid te accipere deceat, sed quid me dare,
Sen. de benef. l. 2. c 16.
The question is not what thou should receive, but what it beseems me to
give. And thus is the marriage of Esther solemnized with state and pomp
suitable: thus is Gods Promise made by Jeremy fulfilled, that if Jechoniah
would not stand out against Nebuchadnezzar, but yield up the City, and go into
captivity, it should be well with him and the people in the land of their
captivity. It was so with him, Psalm. 89 33.
Jer. 52.31. it was so likewise with Esther, Daniel, and many others by their
means. And why? God will not suffer his faithfulness to fail, nor alter the
word that is gone out of his month.

Ver. 19. And when the Virgins were gathered together, etc.] For a new supply
of the Kings insatiable lust, say some, this affection soon growing cold to
Esther. So unreasonable is lust, so inconstant carnal affection, so lawless
are the wicked, so short is any happiness of perfection in this life. The
Septuagint leave out this word [the second time] but the Hebrew verity has it.
Others say, the second time, signifies into the second house of the women. For
they went not each to their own homes, because the King was now fully satisfied
in his choice, as Tremellius and Junius conceive, but they remained in the
custody of Shaazgar Keeper of the Kings Concubines, not suffered to converse
with any man ever after, as Aben-Ezra observes. Therefore they were twice
gathered together. Once, when they were brought to Hegai the Eunuch, and again,
when from the Kings house, they met all together in the second house of the
women, under the Government of Shaazgar.

Then Morde^ai sat in the Kings gate.] As Porter or other Officer, says
Severus: and he attended still upon his office, not fawning on Esther, nor
prolling for preferment. His ambition was to be quiet and to do his own
business, intra pelliculam suam se continere: high feats he knew were never
but uneasy, and long robes cannot but contract much soil. Negotiorum
familiarium curator. 1 These. 4.11. (...).
In the place he now holds, he can hear how it goes with his Esther, and do
the King good service, as verse 21.

Verse 20. Esther had not yet showed her kinred] Taciturnity is sometimes a
virtue, and Tacitus the best Historian. Queen Elizabeth's Motto was, Video,
taceo, I see, and say nothing. Sophocles says, Nothing better becomes a woman
then silence. Euripides also says, that silence, and modesty, and keeping at
home, are the greatest commendation to a woman that can be. Cui tacere grave
sit. Curt. l. 4.
Curtius tells us, that the Persians never trust one whom hey find to be
talkative. Why Esther concealed her kindred, see the note on v. 11. and know
that this is no warrant for popish equivocation; a device of the Jesuits, for
the comfort of afflicted Catholics (as Blackwell and Garnet profess) and for
the instruction of all the godly.

For Esther di^ the commandment of Mordeoai] Her honors had not altered her
manners. She was semper endem, as obsequious and observant of Mordec^^^ still
as ever. So was Joseph, David, Solomon, Epaminondas, and others, of their old
and poorer Parents. Pope Benedict a Lombard, Ani^ Dom. 1303. A shepherds son
would not acknowledge his poor mother, when she came to him Lady-like, but
caused her to put on her shepherdess apparel, and then did her all the honor
that might be. Sir Thomas Moore, would in Westminster Hall beg his fathers
blessing on his knees. Mordecas was Esthers foster-father, and had given her
(though not her being, yet) her well-being; and hence she so respects him, and
is so ruled by him. She had gotten from him that nurture and admonition in the
Lord, that was better to her then the Crown of the Kingdom: for what is
unsanctified greatness but eminent dishonor? and what is dignitas in indigno,
but ornamentum in lute? Salvian.
If any Parents find disobedient children; let them consider whether Eli like,
they have not honored (I mean cockered) their sons too much, 1 Samuel 2.29.
which is the reason they honor then now so little. Will they keep meat well
savoured, yet never salt it? will they have sprigs sprout right, yet never lop
them? Our Henry the second so cockered his eldest son Henry, that he crowned
him whilst himself was yet alive, which made his ambition quite turn off his
obedience, to his fathers great heart-break.

Verse 21. In those dayes] Whiles the King is drowning himself in pleasure, and
dreadeth no danger: whiles he was ravishing and deflowring of Virgins, and
bragging (perhaps) as Proculus the Emperor did, that when he made war upon
the S^^matians; in fifteen days he got with child an hundred Virgins of that
Country, there taken prisoners. Whiles this voluptuous Prince was in the glut
of his carnal delights, in the flagrancy of his sinful lusts his life is sought
for, and hell gapes for him; so slippery places are great ones set in: so does
the Lord sauce their greatest prosperity with sudden and unexpected dangers.
Thus Artilas King of Hunnes was hanged up in gibbets, as it were, by Gods own
hand, in the (...) of his Nuptials. Thus King Henry of France, upon the
marriage of his sister to (...) King of Spain, was so over joyed, that he
called himself by a new title, Tres heureuse Roy, the thrice happy King, But
(to confute him) in solemnizing that marriage, he was slain at Tilt by
Mongomery, Captain of his guard, though against his Will, etc.

Ad ^enerum Cereris sine caede and sanguine panci Juvenal.

Descendunt reges, and sicca merce ^yranni.
While Mor decai sat in the Kings gate] See ver. 19.

Two of the Kings Chamberlaines] In trust I have found treason, said Queen
Elizabeth. So before her, did David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Joash, Amaziah,
Alexander the great, Julius Caesar, and who not, almost? Hence some great
Princes have wished never to have meddled with Government as Augustus, Adrian,
(foelix si non imperitasset) Pertinax, who used to say, that he never in all
his life committed the like fault, as when he accepted the Empire: and many
times he motioned to leave the same, and to return unto his house. Dioclesian
and Maximian did so; for they found, that quot servi, tot hosts; quot
custodes, tot curnifices: they could not be safe from their own servants; but
Damocles-like, they sat at meat with a drawn sword hanging by a twined thread
over their necks. Hence Dionysius durst not trust his own daughter to barbe
him. And Massinissa, King of Numidia, committed his safe-keeping to a guard of
dogs; for men he durst not trust.

Of those which kept the door] sc. Of the Kings bedchamber. Some render it,
which kept the housbold-stuffe^^. Men, they were much entrusted, and therefore
the more to be abhorred. Metuendum est esse sine custode, sed multo magis a
custode metuendum est, Dio Cass.
said Augustus concerning his guard, whom he suspected of treachery: All, or
must of his successors, till Constantine, died unnatural deaths. Let great
ones therefore com^^^ themselves to God in well-doing, as unto a faithful
Creator.

Were wroth] What the occasion of their discontent was, is uncertain. The Greek
and Chaldee say it was, because Mordecai was so promoted. Others, because
Vas^ti was deposed, and Esther advanced to her Royal state. Others say that
they affected the Kingdom, as the Magi had done not long before. Some again,
that they were not well paid their arrears. Sure it is, that ambition, envy,
covetousness, all or some of these stirred them up to this treasonable
attempt. Whatsoever the Sire was, the bastard is anger: and rage likely is the
mother of treason, because as it banisheth reason, and so gives way to all
unrulinesse, so it ends in malice; and malice will have blood.

And sought to lay hands on the King Ahashuerus] Kings are fair marks for
Traitors to shoot at. In which regard -- Miseratque infelix est etiam Rex
Nec quenquam (mihi creed) facit diadema boatum.


Most of the Cesars got nothing by their adoption or designation to the Empire,
Nisi ut citius interficerentur, but to be slain so much the sooner. Treasons
there were so many plotted and practiced against that incomparable Queen
Elizabeth, that she said in Parliament, Camd. Eliz. Pref.
She rather marvelled that she was then mused that she should not be, were in
not that Gods holy hand had protected her beyond expectation. Henry the fourth
of France, Ibid.
was first stabbed in the mouth, and after that in the heart, by those false
Jesuits, whom he had admitted into his very bosom, and used with mavelous
respect. But in would not serve his turn to save his life. His Countreyman
Cominaeus tells us, that if he should write of all the Princes which he knew
in his time, that in the judgment of men seemed to live in great felicity, and
yet to those that knew them familiarly, lived in a miserable estate, that
matter alone would require a reasoriable Volume.

Verse 22. And the thing was known to Mordecai] How he came to know it, is
uncertain. Josephas says, that it was revealed to him by one Barnabazus a Jew,
who was servant to one of the Conspiratours. R. Solomon says, that the
Eunuchs talked of the plot before Mordecai in the language of Tarsus, ^^^^ing
that he had not understood them; and so it came forth. Others conceive, that
(...) solicited him, being one of the Keepers of the Kings door also to join
with them. Howsoever it was that he got inkling and intelligence of their
bloody purpose; God was in it, and good men are of his privy counsel; The
secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, Psalm. 25.11. Their
apprehensions of things are deep, and their observations right, their knowledge
rare to boult out mischiefs, their experience lead them o^ to guess shrewdly
at men's purposes by their looks and gestures. I wisdom dwell with prudence (or
subtilty) and find out knowledge of witty inventions. Prove. 8.12.

Who told it unto Esther the Queen] Happily, as holding himself (a mean man)
unworthy and unfit to speak to the King. Or, as fearing lest he should not be
believed, or should be out-faced by the Traitor, or as conceiving that it
would be better taken from Esther, whom the King so dearly loved; and might
prove a good means to infeoffe her farther into his favor. Yea M^rdec^i
himself (says an Interpreter) might safely have also a further reach herein
namely, to try the sincere affection of Esther toward him, whether she would
make this an occasion to his good and preferment, or rather take the glory
thereof unto her self.

And Esther certified the King thereof in Mordecais name] She does not conceal
the treason, or further it, as some ambitious Semiramis would have done, or
adulterous Livia. For although she was wont to boast that she ruled her husband
Augustus by obeying him, yet Pliny and Tacitus tell us, that she was
over-familiar with Eudemus her Physician. And whereas Augustus his last words
to her were, O Livia, remember our marriage, and Adieu. She did so, and it is
thought had ^ finger in setting him going. And the like i^ reported of
Clytemnestra, Olympia^, Queen Isabel, wife to our Edward the second. But holy
Esther was none such; She, as a loyal and faithful wife, discovers to the
King the danger he was in, and so saves his life, so did Michal David's wife,
though she hall no great goodness in her. The like is reported of Cleopatra,
daughter to Antiochus the great, who gave her in marriage to Ptolem^^
Epiphant^, thinking by her to destroy him, but he was deceived, according to
Dan. 11.17. Valerius Maximus and Fulgesius speak much in the commendation of
Thuria, Sulpitia, Chilonia, Antonia, Egnatia, etc. for loving and faithful
wives Val^^^^ Maximus Christianus also for like cause, celebrateth (...), wife
to Philip the Emperor and Mary, wife to Sigism^^d, King of Bohemia and
Hungary, etc. lib 2. cap 16.


Verum hac (Esther) tantum alias inter capat extulit omnes,
Quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi.
Verse 23. And when Inquisition was made of the matter] The King neither
slighted this accusation, not over-hastily believed it. Not this, lest he
should discover a needless fear, or precipitate a wrong sentence. Not that,
lest he should betray his own life, and put all into a confusion, as Gedaliah
did, Jer. 40. and 41. and as he in the history did, who being forewarned by a
letter, of a dangerous plot laid for his life, laid aside the letter with these
words, (...), Tomorrow we will mind these serious businesses, but ere the
morrow he was dispatched. The matter was here enquired into, says the text,
lest happily it might be mis-reported, and so the innocent be punished. Or, if
not innocent, yet Does our Law condemn any before his cause be heard? Surely
Pilate and Festus were far better Justicers then Caiaphas and Lysias, for
they would execute a man in the morning, and then sit upon him in the
afternoon. Aeneas Sylvius, in his twentieth chapter of Europe, tells of some
places, wherein if any one be suspected of theft, he is forthwith taken and
trussed up. Three days after, they judge of the suspicion: and if they find
the man guilty, they let his carcass hang till it rot: as if otherwise, they
take it down and bury it honorably at the public charge. This is preposterous
justice, judgment turned into gall, and righteousness into hemlock.

It was found out] As treason usually is, and strangely: witness those in
Queen Elizabeth's reign, and the powder-plotters. Creighton the Jesuit, a Scot,
sailing into Scotland, and being taken by certain Netherland-Pirates, had torn
certain papers in pieces. But the torn pieces being thrown out of the ship,
were blown back again by the wind and cast by a Providence into the ship, not
without a miracle as Creighton said himself. Camd. Eliz. 266.
Which being set together by Wade, with much labor and singular cunning,
discovered new designs of the Pope and his Agents here against England. Anno
1585. Detexit facinus fatnus and non implevit, says Tacitus of one about his
time. Either the Traitors own tongue shall betray him (as it befell those two
sent by Mahomet to kill Scanderbeg) or the fowls of heaven shall reveal the
mischief, Turk. Hist. fol. 60.
and that which has wing shall tell the matter, Eccles. 10.20. (It was a piece
of a wing, a quill that discovered that hellish powder plot) Or some other way
it shall be found out, as here, and the Conspiratours brought to condign
punishment.

Therefore they were both hanged on a tree] Traitors, like bells, will be
never well tuned till well hanged, till they have worn a Tyburne-tippet, as
father Latimer phrased it. Campian that spider was swept down by the hand of
justice, and drew his last thread in the Triangle of Tyburne. His words in his
Epistle to the Honorable Counselors of Queen Elizabeth were these, Quamdiu
vel unus quispiam e nobis supererit qui Tyburno vestro fruatur, etc. As long as
there is any one of us left to enjoy your Tyburne, etc. Much joy may they have
of it, since it is their ambition, and may their quarters be set as high, as
that false Edricks head once was by King Knute, viz. Dan. Hist. 19.
upon the highest part of the tower of London, therein performing his Promise
to a Traitor, of advancing him above any Lord of the Land.

And it was written in the book of the Chronicles] Heb. in the book of the
words of days, in the Diary of the Kings, or in the book of remembrance. As
the Jews, so the Persians had their Chronicles or public Commentaries,
wherein all memorable acts were recorded, and Scribes or Historiographers for
that purpose appointed and maintained; Plutarch writes that at that great
sea-^ight between Themistocles and the Persians, Xerxes sat in a throne of
gold, and saw the conflict, having many Scribes about him, whose office was to
set down all that was done that day. This was a commendable custom, and might
be a motive to their Kings and great ones to take heed of doing ought that they
would not have registered and read by succeeding ages Suetonius tells us,
Suet. in August.
that Augustus upon this account, forbade his Daughter and Neeces to say or do
any thing that they would not have to be chronicled.

Before the King] Perhaps in his presence, and for his special use though
Mordecai's good service was soon forgotten, God forget not to recompense
Ahashuerus his love to Fisther, and courtesy to her people, by detecting and
defeating those Conspiratours that ^ought his life. But he soon forgets
Mordecai, Gods instrument for his deliverance, though the matter were written
in a book before him; hence he goes noted with a black coal for his
ingratitude. Tamerlane had a catalogue of the names of such as had best
deserved of him, Turk. Hist. 227.
which he daily perused, oftentimes saying, that day to be lost wherein he had
not given them something. There was a Providence in it, that nothing was yet
done for Mordecai. Gods time is the best, and we shall one day say so: neither
is there any thing lost by waiting his leisure. He bottles up our tears, he
books up our sighs, he writes down all we say or do in his roll of
remembrance, Mal. 3.6, 10. See the Note there, and the Reference.

CHAP. III. Verse 3. After these things did King Ahashuerus promote Haman.]
Four years after his marriage with Esther, (or near upon) did Ahashuerus
magnify and exalt Haman, Hominem profanum and sceleratum, as one says, a
profane wicked person: merely for his mind sake, Alexander the Great made
Abdolominus a poor Gardener King of Siden.
to show his Soveraignity, and that he would, like some petty god upon earth,
set up whom he would, and whom he would, put down, Dan. 4.19. Whether it were
also by flattery or sycophancy, or some new projects for establishing his
tyranny, and increasing his tributes, that Haman had insinuated himself into
this Kings favor, it is uncertain. Sure it is, that Mordecai, a better man,
lay yet unlook't upon; like good corn he lay in the bottom of the heap, when
this vilest of men was exalted, Psalm. 12.8. Thus often empty vessels swim aloft,
rotten posts are gilt with adulterate gold, the worst weeds spring up bravest;
and when the twins strive in Rebecca's womb, profane Esau comes forth first,
and has the primogeniture, Genesis 25.25. But whiles they seek the greatest
dignities, they mostly meet with the greatest shame, like Apes, while they be
climing, they the more show their deformities. They are lifted up also, ut
lapsu graviore ruant that they may come down again with the greater poise. It
was therefore well and wisely spoken by Alvarez de Luna, when he told them who
admired his fortune and favor with the King of Castile. You do wrong to
commend the building before it be finished, and until you see how it will stand.

The son of Amedatha the Agagite] i.e. The Amalekite, of the Stock-royal: so
that Haman was the natural enemy of the Jews, like as Annibal was of the
Romans. An old grudge there was, an inveterate hatred: Amalek was Esau's
grandchild, and the enmity betwixt these two peoples was, as we say of
runnet, the older the stronger.

And advanced him] Set him aloft upon the pinnacle of highest preferment, as
Tiberius did Sejanus, as Lewis the eleventh of France did his Barber, as our
Henry the eighth did Wolsey; and our late Kings, Buckingham. But Princes
Favorites should consider with themselves, that honor is but a blast, a
magnum nihil, a glorious fancy, a rattle to still men's ambition, and that as
the Passenger looks no longer upon the dial, then the Sun shines upon it: So
it is here.

And set his seat above all the Princes] This cup of honor his weak head could
not bear: this blast so blew up the bubble, that it burst again. Sejanus-like,
he now began to sacrifice to himself, little thinking of that utter ruin to
the which he was ha^ting. Physicians use to say, that ultimus sanitatis gradus
est morbo vicinus. Sure it is, that when the wicked are near unto misery, they
have greatest preferment and prosperity. When Tiberius was desirous to rid his
hands of Sejanus, he made him his Colleague in the Consulship, and set him
above all his Courtiers. Ahashuerus intended not any hurt to Haman, when he
raised him to this pitch of preferment; but it puffed him up, and proved his
bane. None are in so great danger, as those that walk upon pinacles: even
height it self makes men's brains to swim. Every man is not a Joseph, or a
Daniel. They were set above all the Princes, and could not only bear it, but
improve it for the glory of God, and the good of his people. Sed o quam hoc non
est omnium! High seats are not only uneasy, but dangerous, and how few are
there that do not (as Is^s her ass) think themselves worshipful for the
burden they bear? Hones onus.


Verse 2. And all the Kings servants] His Courtiers and others; not his menial
servants only.

That were in the Kings gate] Where the Courtiers used to walk, that they night
be at a call: and where others attended, that had business at the Court.

Bowed and reverenced Haman] Not with so much readiness and diligence, as
impudence and baseness: for should men bow to a molten calfe, because made up
of golden eare-rings? Many of these cringing Courtiers could not but hate Haman
in their hearts, and were as ready to wish him hanged, and to tell the King
shortly after where he might have a fit gallows for him. So Sejanus his
greatest friends, who had deified him before, when once he fell out of the
Emperors favor, showed themselves most passionate against him, saying, that
if Caesar had clemency, he ought to reserve it for men, not use it toward
monsters.

For the King had so commanded concerning him] And if the King had commanded
these servile fowls to worship a dog or a cat, as the Egyptians did a golden
image, as Nebuchadnezzars subjects did; to turn the glory of the incorruptible
God into the similitude of a corruptible man, of foure-footed beasts or
creeping things, as Romans 1.23. they would have done it. Most people are of King
Harry's religion, as the proverb is, resolving to do as the most do, though
thereby they be undone for ever. This is to be worse then some Heathens. See
the note on Acts 4.10. But why should Ahashuerus be so hasty to heap such
honors upon so worthless and wicked a person, but that he had a mind to
proclaim his own folly to all his Kingdom?

But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence] He did not, he durst not,
though pressed and urged to it with greatest importunity. And why? not because
Haman wore a picture openly in his bosom, as the Chaldee Paraphrast and Aben
Ezra give the reason, Nor merely (if at all, which some doubt of) because he
was a cursed Amalekite; But because the Persian Kings required, that themselves
and their chief Favorites (such as proud Haman was,) should be reverenced with
a kind of divine honor, Herod. l 1. Valor. l. 7 c. 3. Curt. l 3. and 5.
more then was due to any man. This the Jews were flatly forbidden by their
Law to do. The Lacedaemonians also were resolute against it, as Herodotus in his
seventh book relates. Pelopidas the Thebane would not be drawn to worship the
Persian Monarch in this sort. Plut. in Artax. Justin. l 6. Val. l. 6. c. 33.
No more would Conon the Athenian General. And when Timagoras did, the
Athenians condemned him to die for it. It was not therefore pride or
self-willednesse that made Mordecai so stiff in the hams that he would not
bend to Haman; but fear of sin, Nihil praeter peccatum timeo. Basil.
and conscience of duty. He knew, that he had better offend all the world, then
God and his own conscience.

Verse 3. Then the Kings servants, etc.] See verse 2.

Said unto Mordecai] Tempting his piety and constancy not once, but often,
alleging the Kings commandment, together with his alonenesse in refusing to
obey it, Hamans power, displeasure, etc. Thus they presented to Mordecai both
Irritamenta and Terriculamenta, i.e. Allurements and Affrightments, according
to that of the Apostle, Heb. 11.37. they were tempted on both hands, but all in
vain. Sapientis virtus, perea quibus petitur, illustratur. This constancy
wicked men call obstinacy, but they speak evil of that they know not, viz. the
power of the Spirit, and the privy armor of proof, that the Saints have about
their hearts.

Why transgressest thou the Kings Commandment] Right or wrong, it matters not
with many; if the King or State have commanded a thing, done it must be. But
what said that Martyr to the Popish Bishop, pressing him with this Argument,
and affirming, that the Kings Laws must be obeyed, whether they agree with the
Word of God or not, yea, though the King were an infidel? If Shedrach, Meshech
and Abednego had been of your mind, my Lord, Act and M^n. 1550.
(said Roger Coo, Martyr) Nebuchadnezzar had not confessed the living God. True
it is, that we must give unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's. But withal,
we must see to it, that we give unto God the things that are Gods, Matthew.
22.21. where the three articles used in the Original are very emphatical. (...).
And it is a saying of Chrysostom, If Caesar will take to himself Gods part,
by commanding that which is sinful, to pay him such a tribute is not tributum
Caesaris, but servitium diaboli, an observing of Caesar, but a serving of the
devil.

Verse 4. Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him] This if they
did of good will, (as at first perhaps they did) it was a friendly office, and
may shame many of us who are so backward to Christian admonition, (See my
common places) that spiritual Alms, that we are bound freely to distribute.
Jude 22.23. But if (as is likely, at length at least) they did it to ingratiate
with Haman, and out of envy to Mordecai, because he did not comply and comport
with them, what did they else but act the devils part; and the rather, because
they were importunate and impudent as not to take an answer?

And he hearkened not unto them] They did but surdo fabulam (as they say) beat
upon cold iron; Act. and Mon. John Ardley.
this matter was not malleable, this man not to be prevailed with, to do ought
against his conscience. The Heavens shall sooner fall, then I will alter mine
opinion, said that Martyr. This the Persecutours called obstinacy: sed pro hac
obstinatione fi^ei mor^mar, says Tertullian, but for this obstinacy of faith
we gladly die: and the stronger any are in faith, the more resolute in
warrantable purposes. The strength of Israel repents not, 1 Samuel 10.29.
Unconstancy comes from weakness.

That they told Haman] Purposely to pick a thank and curry favor. Go not about
as a talebearer, Levit. 19.16. The word signifies as a peddler, that first
fills his pack with tales and slanders, and then venteth them to the hurt of
others. Such are fitly joined with flatterers. Prove. 20.19. and with
murderers, Ezekiel. 22.9. Such a wretched Peddler was Doeg, and such were these
evil instruments in the text, whose tongues were as sharp as the quills of a
Porcupine, the poison of aspes was under their lips. And although it was truth
they told Haman, yet because they did it not for any love to the truth, nor for
respect to justice, nor for the bettering of either party, but only to undo the
one, and to incense the other, they were no better then flanderers.

To see whether Mordecai's matters would stand] Whether he would stick to his
principles, and not start aside for any terror, Phil. 1.28.

For he had told them that he was a Jew] That is, by Interpretation, a
Confessor: yea more, he was a stout Professor of the truth: and though he had
hitherto concealed himself, yet now (since they will needs have it so) he
plainly tells them, his country and his conscience, the true cause of his
peremptorinesse, which they held and called pr^de and stubbornness.

Verse 5. And when Haman saw] Stirred up by these pestilent pick-thanks, qui
crabronem furiosum magis irritaverant (as one says) he took special notice of
Hamans irreverence, which with more discretion he might have dissembled. When
an inconsiderate fellow had stricken Cato in the Bath, and afterward cried him
mercy, he replied, I remember not that thou did strike me; It Is a sign of
weakness to be too soft and sensible of an indignity; Sen. de it. l. 1.
I was as a deaf man that heard not, and as one dumb, in whose mouth is no
reproof, Psalm. 38.13, 14. The best apology to words and carriages of scorn and
petulancy, is that of Isaac to Ishmael, viz. patience and silence.

That Mordecai bowed not, etc.] A great business to mad him so much, but that
he was set on by that old manslayer.

Sic leve, sic parvum est animum quod laudis avarum
Subruit, aut reficit --
A small wind raises a bubble, ambition rides without reins, and has
inhabitatorem Draconem Apostatam, the devil at inn with it.

Then was Haman full of wrath] He swelled like a toad, glowed like a devil;
being transformed as it were, into a breathing devil, he seeks the utter
extirpation of that people, of whom, (...).
as corcerning the flesh; Christ was to come, Romans 9.5. wishing the same to
them which Caligula in a rage did to the people of Rome, I would ye had all but
one neck, that I might cut you all off at one blow. Josephus tells us, that he
brake out into this blustering speech, Liberi Persae me adorant. Hic autem,
servus cum sit, tamen hoc fa^ere dedignatur. The Persians, though freemen,
reverence me, and yet this slave thinks himself too good to do it. This he
uttered no doubt with a very harsh and hateful intention of the voice, such as
was that of the two brethren in evil, (whose anger was fierce; and their wrath
cruel) when Genesis 34.31. they answered their aggrieved father. Should he deal
with our sister as an harlot? where the word Z^nab (Harlot) has a great
letter, Genesis 49.5, 7.
to note their vehemence, rage and rudeness.

Verse 6. (...).
And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone] He thought it a small
matter, says Josephus, a thing below him, too little for his revenge, which
like fire burns all it can lay hold upon, especially when as here it arises
from ambition, which like choler a dust, if obstructed and stopped in its
course, is a dangerous passion* and ends in burning fevers and madness.
Haman thought scorn, ( contempsit in oculis suis, so the Hebrew) to foul his
fingers with Mordecai alone, the whole Nation must perish, and all the children
of God that were scattered abroad, as he once said, John 11.50, 52. Semblably,
nostri temporis Hamanus (says Merlin upon this text,) the Haman of our time,
(meaning the Duke of Guise, as I suppose) when as by the Kings favor he was
promoted, and promised himself the Crown, there being but one family only that
stood in his way, he desired together with it to overturn all the Reformed
Religion, and to root out all the remembrance of the Churches in France. Hence
the Parisian Massacre, (wherein Merlin had his part, being houshold-Chaplaine
to the Admiral, and by a miracle of Gods mercy escaping those hellish
cut-throates.) The first occasion of that bloody Massacre, I have somewhere
read, was this. (Other things I know were pretended, as if the Protestants had,
plotted and practiced against the King, Queen Mother, and the Princes of the
blood, Camd. Eliz.
and coin stamped with this Inscription, Virtus in rebels, etc.) The Pope
sent to the Cardinal of Lorraine, (brother to the Duke of Guise) a Table,
wherein was painted our Lady with a little child in her arms, by the most
excellent Painter in Christendom, and consecrated with his own hands, and
enclosed it in a case of silk, and a letter withal giving him high commendation
and thanks for his zeal against the Huguenots. The messenger that carried the
Present fell sick by the way, and finding one going into France, entreated him
to deliver the Present to the Cardinal. The Cardinal read the letter, and laid
the Table on his bed, for he would not open it, till he might do it with
greater solemnity. For this purpose he invited the Duke of Guise to dinner with
many other great Personages. In the mean while, one that liked not the
Cardinal, found means to change the Table, etc. At dinner the letter was read,
and the Table taken out of the case in the sight of the Cardinal, and all his
guests, wherein was painted in place of our Lady and her child, the Cardinal
of Lorraine stark naked, the Queen Mother, the young Queen of Scots, and the
old Duchess of Guise naked also, hanging about the Cardinals neck, and their
legs wrapped between his legs. I cannot say much for the man that did this
prank: but that the Cardinal and his Accomplices should thereupon design all the
French Protestants to destruction, should butcher thirty thousand of them in a
month, one hundred thousand of them in one year, some say three hundred
thousand: that upon the news of it the Pope should proclaim a Jubilee for joy,
Act. and Mon.
and the Cardinal of Lorraine give the messenger a thousand Crowns, etc. This
was matchless immanity, this was Haman-like hatred, this was cruelty beyond
that of Simeon and Levi, which made good Jacob in a deep detestation of that
dirity, cry out, O my soul, come not thou into their secret, etc. Genesis 49.6.

For they had showed him the people of Mordecai] Viz. That he was a Jew.
Josephus his note upon this text is. Haman naturally hated the Jews, as those
that had anciently destroyed the Amalekites his Countrymen. He might easily
call to mind what Saul had done to them, and David, and lastly the tribe of
Simeon. God had sentenced them long since to utter destruction; and yet
deferred the first execution for about four hundred years space: and now
again, after more then five hundred years, Haman the Agagite is thus exalted,
but for a mischief, as the Eagle carries the Tortoise on high in her talons,
that she may break it in the fall, and feed upon it.

Patientia laesa fit furor. Wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jewes] Vt
sanguineam famem expleret, as a wolf breaking into the fold kills all the
flock: as fowlers take away the young and the dammes together putting both into
the bag (which God forbade, Deuteronomy. 22.6.) as Esau, that rough man, came with
four hundred cutthroats at his heels, to destroy the mother with the
children, Genesis 32.11. Turk. hist. 369.
as Vladus, Prince of Valachia, was wont, together with the offender, to
execute the whole family, yea, sometimes the whole kindred as Selimus the great
Turk in revenge of the loss he received at the battle of Lepanto, resolved to
put to death all the Christians in his dominions, Ibid. 885.
in number infinite: As Philip of Spain sailed out of the Low-countreyes
homewards, vowing to root out all the Lutherans there. Hist. of Counc. of
Tr^us. 417.
and protesting that he had rather have no subjects then such; As cruel Doctor
Story a great Persecutor in Queen Mary's reign, Anno 1571. Camd. Eliz.
and hanged for a Traitor in Queen Elizabeth's, whose death he had conspired,
cursing her daily in his Grace at board, and greatly repenting that he and
others had labored only about the young sprigs and twigs (as he phrased it)
while they should have stricken at the root, Act. and Mon. 1925.
and clean rooted it out. Lastly, as the Gunpowder Papists, who had prepared
by Proclamations to father that horrid plot (if it had taken effect) upon the
Puritanes, and under that name to have murdered all those that had but looked
toward Religion.

That were throughout the whole Kingdome] Herein he showed himself a right
Amalekite, (...). De Tib. Theodor. Gadareus.
Mali corvi malum ^^um, dirt kneaded with blood, as one said of Tiberius, He
presumed he might have what he pleased of the King, and therefore made account
to make but a Breakfast of his enemies the Jews, to whom he said in his heart,
as once Caligula did to the Roman Consuls, Rideo, quod uno nutu meo jugulare
vos omnes possim. I cannot but laugh to think, that I can nod you all to death.

Even the people of Mordecai,] Who were more renowned by him then Co was by
Hippocrates, Thebes by Epaminondas, Stagira by Aristotle, Hyppo by Augustine.
etc.

Verse 7. In the first moneth] The time is thus noted, ad majorem historiae
fidem and lucem, to give more credit to the History, and to lend some light to
it.

That is the month Nisan] The Chaldees call it Abib, from the new fruits or
ears of corn then first appearing. It was the first month unto Israel, (in
respect of sacred, not civil affairs) because of their coming out of Egypt
therein. It answers to part of March with us, and part of April.

In the twelfth year of King Ahashuerus] When Esther had now been Queen above
four years, and being greatly beloved, was in a capacity to do her people
good. This was a sweet Providence, the remedy was ready before the disease
brake out. No Country has more venomous creatures then Egypt, none more
Antidotes. So godliness has many troubles, and as many helps against trouble.

They cast Pur, that is, the Lot] The old Interpreter adds in urnam, into the
pitcher. And the new Annotations tell us, that about casting lots, there was a
pitcher into which papers, with names of the several months written on them,
and rolled up were cast, yea, also papers with the names of every day, and of
every month were cast in: then one blind-folded put in his hand and pulled out
a paper, and according to the marks which they had set down, such a month
proved lucky, and such a day in the month; and by Gods Providence it so fell
out, that their supposed luckie day was on the twelfth month, whereby it came
to pass, that their plot was defeated, before the time of accomplishing
thereof, chap. 9.1, etc.

From day to day, etc.] This is not to be taken as if they had continued twelve
months about in casting of these lots: but as in the Note next above.

That is the month Adar] In all which time that wicked Haman might have
bethought himself (as one notes) and returned to a better mind toward Gods
people. But he, after the hardness of his heart, that could not repent,
treasured up unto himself wrath against the day of wrath, etc. Romans 2.5.

Verse 8. And Haman said unto King Ahashuerus] After that by sortilegy, (or
sorcery, for it is no better, as the very name shows, and Varro affirms,)
he had light upon a luckie day, wherein to speak to the King, and a black day,
wherein to do execution, he takes the boldness to move the King in it. Now
Mr. Perkins affirms, that as men do put confidence in lot-sorcery, or the
like diabolical divinations, or else they cannot attain to any foreknowledge
by them; so therein, explicitly or implicitly, they have confederacy with the
devil, Oh, that this were well considered!

There is a certain people] Not worth the naming.

Scattered abroad] But was that their fault? was it not their misery rather,
according to that God had threatened them, Deuteronomy. 3 2. and were they not
therefore to be pitied, and not preyed upon? It is said of Queen Elizabeth,
Camd Eliz. 531.
that she hated, no less then did Mithridates, such as maliciously persecuted
virtue forsaken of fortune.

And dispersed among the people] And therefore the more dangerous, since every
sect strives to spread their opinions, and these, being Antimagistratical, may
do much hurt, and draw many from their obedience, prove seedsmen of sedition.
It may very well be that the sect of the Essenes were now beginning among the
Jews, who taught, Joseph. l. 18. c. 2.
that God alone, and no mortal man was to be acknowledged for Lord and Prince.
Hence they were called Esseni or Hashoni, that is, Rebels, Weems.
and for their sakes the whole Nation might be the worse thought of (as if they
were all such) like as the Protestants were in France for the Anabaptists sake,
in the reign of King Francis. Scultet. An. 454.


In all the Provinces of thy Kingdome] Quarum proventu gaudet, alitur,
insolescit. Where they do no good, but devour grain as vermin, as excrements
in humane society, and deserve to be knocked on the head, which may easily be
done, because they are disjected, and not able to make head against an
adversary.

And their Laws are diverse from all people] So they were, and better, their
enemies themselves being Judges, Deuteronomy. 4.6, 7, 8. Prospers conceit was, that
they were called Judaei, because they received Jus Dei, their Laws from God,
who might say to them, as once Joseph did to his brethren, Genesis 45.12. Behold,
your eyes see, that it is my mouth that speaks unto you. (...).
And therefore if Demosthenes could say of Laws in general, that they were the
invention of Almighty God; And if Cicero could say of the Laws of the twelve
Tables in Rome, that they far exceeded and excelled all the Libraries of all
the Philosophers, how much more true was all this of the Laws of the Jews
given by God, and ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator, Moses? Seneca
(though he jeared the Jews for their weekly Sabbath, as those that lost the
seventh part of their time, yet) he could not but say, that being the basest
people, they had the best Laws, and gave Laws unto all the world. Those holy
Levites, Nehem. 9.13. acknowledge with all thankfulness, that God had given
them right judgments, true Laws, good Statutes and Commandments, whereby he
severed them from all other people, as his own peculiar, and this was their
glory wherever they came; though the Sycophant in the text turns their glory
into shame, as one that loved vanity, and sought after leasing, Psalm. 4.2.

Neither keep they the Kings Lawes] Mordecai indeed would not do him reverence,
because it went against his conscience: no more would others of them keep the
Kings Laws in like case, but obey God rather then man, where they could not do
both. Otherwise they were charged, Jer. 29.7. to seek the peace of the cities
where they abode, and to submit to their civil and municipal Laws: and so they
did doubtless, for the generality of them. But this impudent liar represents
them to the King as Refractaries and Rebels, etc. The devil began his Kingdom
by a lie, and by lies he upholdeth it. He was a liar and a murderer from the
beginning; but first a liar, and thereby a murderer. He cannot handsomely
murder, except he slander first, Cant. 5.6. the credit of the Church must
first be taken away, and then she is wounded; traduced she must be, and then
persecuted. Thus David is believed to seek Saul's life: Elias is the Troubler of
Israel: Jeremy, the Trumpet of Rebellion: the Baptist, a Stirrer up of
sedition: Christ, an enemy to Caesar: Paul, a pestilent Incendiary; the
primitive Christians, a public mischief: the Reformed Churches,
Antimagistratical: this color of right, yea, of Piety was laid upon the French
Massacre, and by Edicts a fair cloak sought to cover that impious fraud, Camd.
Eliz.
as if there had been some horrid treason hatched by the Huguenots. The
primitive Persecutours used to put Christians into bears and dogs skins, or
other ugly creatures; and then bait them; so wicked men put religion and its
Professors, into ugly conceits and reports, and then speak and act against
them.

Therefore it is not for the Kings profit] Heb. It is not meet, equal, or
profitable to the King to suffer them, ut insolescat per licentiam, so the
Vulgar Latin renders it, but without warrant from the Orig. See here how this
Sycophant fills his mouth with arguments, the better to atchieve his desire. An
elaborate set speech he makes, neither is there a word in it, but what might
seem to have weight. He pretends the Kings profit and the public good,
concealing and dissembling his ambition, avarice, envy, malignity, that set him
a work. Politicians when they soar highest, are like the Eagle, which whiles
aloft, has her eye still upon the prey, which by this means she spies sooner,
and seizes upon better. In parabola ovis caprus suas quaerunt, as the Proverb
has it, Haman holds it not fit there should be more religions then one in a
Kingdom, for preventing of troubles. Nebuchadnezzar was of the same mind,
when he commanded all men to worship his golden image. But must all therefore
die that will not do it? and is it for the Kings profit that the righteous be
rooted out? Is not semen sanctum statumen terrae? the holy seed, Isa. 6.13.
the stay of the State? the beauty and bulwark of the Nation? See Jer. 5.1.
Ezekiel. 2.2.30, 31. Absque stationibus non staret mundus.

Verse 9. If it please the King] Here he shows himself a right Courtier, and
speaks silken words, the sooner to insinuate. But if Solomon had been by, he
would have said, Prove. 26.25.
When he speaks fair, believe him not, for there are seven abominations in
his heart.

Let it be written that they may be destroyed] As Mithridates King of Pontus,
by writing one bloody letter only, Val Max.
destroyed fourscore thousand Citizens of Rome, dispersed up and down Asia for
traffic sake. That was bad, but this was worse that Haman motioned, and
well-near effected. Rup. l. 8. de virt. verb. c. 7.
And surely never did the old red dragon (says Rupertus) lift up his head so
fiercely and furiously against the woman, that is, against the Church of God,
as in this place. Therefore is Haman to be reckoned among those cruel enemies,
who said, Psalm. 83.
Come and let us destroy them from being a Nation, that the name of Israel may
be no more remembered. But let them rage and kill up the Saints as much as they
can, the sheep will still be more in number then the wolves, the doves then the
hawks. Plures efficimur quoties metimur, Tertull. Apoll.
says Tertullian, the more you crop us, the faster we grow.

And I shall pay ten thousand talents of silver] A vast sum, three thousand
seven hundred fifty thousand pound sterling. At so great charge would this
butcher be, to satisfy his lust, and to have his penmworths upon Gods poor
people. So in the Gunpowder treason, (besides their pains, digging like moles
in their vault of villainy) Digby offered to bring in fifteen hundred pounds,
Tressam two thousand, Piercy four thousand out of the Earl of Northumberlands
rents: besides ten swift horses to stead them when the blow was past. But where
should Haman have all this money, may some say? I answer, First if he were of
the seed-royal of Amalek (as it is thought) he might have much left him by his
Ancestors. Secondly, being so great a Favorite to the King of Persia, he had
doubtless many profitable offices, and so might lay up gold as dust, Job 22.24.
and silver as the stones of the brooks. Did not Wolsey so here in Henry the
eighth's time? Thirdly, he had already devoured in his hopes, the goods and
spoils of all the slain Jews, which he doubted not but the King would bestow
upon him, for his good service. Like as Henry the second of France, gave his
Mistress Diana Valentina, all the confiscations of goods made in the Kingdom
for cause of heresy. Hereupon many good men were burned for religion, Hist. of
Counc. of Trent. 387.
as it was said, but indeed it was to satiate her covetousness.

To the hands of those, etc.] Vulg. Arcarsis gazae tuae.

To bring it into the Kings treasuries] That he might not be damnified in the
tributes formerly paid by the Jews for their liberty of conscience. Kings use
to take care, that their incomes and revenues be not empaired or diminished. It
is said of Solomon the great Turk, that seeing a company of many thousands of
his Christian subjects fall down before him, and hold up the forefinger (as
their manner of Conversion to the Turkish religion is) he asked what moved them
to turn? they replied, it was to be eased of their heavy taxations. S. H. Bl.
Voyage p. 181.
He not willing to lose in tribute for an unsound accession in religion,
rejected their Conversion, and doubled their taxations.

Verse 10. And the King took his ring from his hand] And thereby gave him power
to do what he pleased, Genesis 41.42. 1 Kings 21.8. En regis bujus inertiam and
imperitiam. How weak ( weak as water, Genesis 49.4.) was the heart of this brutish
Barbarian, skilful to destroy? Ezekiel. 21.31. seeing he did all these things, the
work of an imperious whorish woman, Ezekiel. 16.30. rather then of an able man,
(such as every Magistrate should be, Exodus 18.21.) just, and ruling in the
fear of God, 2 Samuel 23.3. In the case of Vashti, he could refer the matter
to the consideration of a Council. In the case of the two Eunuchs that had
conspired aganst his life, he made inquisition of the matter, and did all
things deliberately. In this case of Haman after this, though deeply
displeased, yet he did nothing rashly, till he had gone into the Palace-garden,
and considered with himself what was best to be done. But here upon the very
first motion (without hearing them speak for themselves, or admonishing them to
do their duty better, etc.) he gives order for the slaying of so many thousand
innocents never considering that every drop of their blood had a voice in it,
to cry for vengeance against him and his, Genesis 4.10. Matthew. 22.7. And when the
King heard it for blood cries aloud to God, 1 Kings 9.26. Surely I have seen
yesterday the blood of Naboth. Murder ever bleeds fresh in the eye of Almighty
God. To him many years, yea, that eternity that is past, is but yesterday. He
will give such, blood again to drink, for they are worthy, Rev. 16.6. Dealt he
not so by Herod, Julian, Attilas, Felix of Wartemburg, Farnesius, Minerius,
Charles the ninth King of France, who died by exceeding bleeding at sundry
parts of his body, soon after the Parisian Massacre, whereof he was the
Author, giving as large and as bloody a commission to the Duke of Guise, to
destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish all the French Protestants, as
Ahashuerus did here to Haman? Neither was he slack to execute it with greatest
inhumanity, crying out to those of his party (after that he had slain the
Admiral) Courage, my fellows, fall on, the King commands it, it is his
express pleasure, he commands it. But what followed shortly after? The Histe
of French Mass. by Mr. Clark.


Quem sitiit vivens scelerata mente cruorem,
Perfidus hunc moriens Carolus ore vomit.
Ergo Dei tandem verbo subscribite, Reges;
Ne rapiant Stygiae vos Acherontis aquae.
And gave it unto Haman] Who now being his Favorite, might have any thing of
him, like as it is storied of Sejanus, that in all his designs he found in
Tiberius the Emperor so great facility and affection to his desire, Life of
Sejan. by P.M. p. 5.
that he needed only to ask and give thanks. He never denied him any thing, and
oft-times prevented his request, and avowed that he deserved much more. It was
not therefore without cause, Tertull. Apol.
that the primitive Christians prayed so hard for the Emperor, that God would
send him good Counselors, and deliver him from flatterers and slanderers,
those pests of the Court.

The Jews enemy] That was his style, or rather his brand and mark of ignominy,
worse then that of Cain, Genesis 4.15. that of Dathan, Numb. 26.9. of Ahaz, 2 Chronicles. 28.22. It may be he affected this title, and gloried in it: as we read
of John Oneale, father to the Earl of Tyrone, that rebel 1598. Camd.
that he inscribed himself in all places. I great John Oneale, Cousin to
Christ, friend to the Queen of England, and foe to all the world besides.

Verse 11. And the King said unto Haman] Whom he looked upon, as an honest,
prudent, publike-spirited man, and therefore so easily empowered him to do what
he would.

O vanas hominum mentes! O pectora caeca! The silver is given unto thee] i. e.
the ten thousand talents that thou have proffered, and which Haman likely
purposed to raise out of the spoil of the Jews; all this is remitted, and
returned to Haman as a gift again. Sic ex alieno corio gigantes isti latiss^mas
corrigias secant, says an Interpreter here, Such large thongs cut these Giants
out of other men's Hides. But what meant they thus to sell the Hide, before they
had taken the beast? He that sat in heaven (and had otherwise determined it)
laughed at them, the Lord had them in derision. With him (alone) is strength
and wisdom, the deceived and the deceiver are his. He leads Counselors away
spoiled, and makes the Judges fools. He leads Princes away spoiled, and
overthrows the mighty, Job 12.16, 17, 19. Psalm. 2.


The people also, to do with them] Here Haman was made, here he had more then
heart could wish, as Psalm. 73.7. and holds himself therefore, no doubt, the
happiest man under heaven. But Nihil sane infelicius est felicitate peccantium,
says Hierom, there cannot befall a man a greater misery then to prosper in
sin: for such a one is ripening for ruin, as fatting cattle are fitting for
the shambles, They prosper and live at ease, says God, yet I am extremely
displeased with them, Zech. 1.15. As they say of the metal they make glass of,
it is nearest melting when it shines brightest; so are the wicked nearest
destruction when at greatest luster. Meane-while see here what, many times, is
the condition of Gods dearest children, viz. to fall into the power and paws
of Lions, Leopards, Boares, Bears, Tigers; of men more savage then any of
these, whose tender mercies are mere cruelties. Poor blind men they are, that
offer violence to the Saints, as Sampson laid hands upon the pillars, to pluck
the house upon their own heads.

To do with them as it seems good to thee] O bloody sentence! Such words as
these Leniter volant, sed non leniter violant. So Dioclesian gave leave to
people to kill up Christians, without more ado, wherever they met them; the
like was done by authority in the French Massacre; but though Tyrants restrain
not their Agents, yet God will, Psalm. 76.10. And though they bandy together,
and bend all their forces to root out true Religion; yet are they bounded by
him, and shall not do what themselves please, but what he has appointed. My
times are in thine hand, says David, and Pilate had no more power to crucify
Christ, then what was given him from above, John 19.11.

Verse 12. Then were the Kings Scribes called] Then, presently upon it, so soon
as the word was out of the Kings mouth, licet quod libet: the Scribes were
called, and all things dispatched with all possible haste, art and industry. So
Judas, what he did, did quickly; he was up and at it, when Peter and the rest
of the Apostles were sound asleep. The children of this world are wiser in
their generation then the children of light; for why? they have the devil to
help them, and to prick them on; and hence their restlesnesse.

On the thirteenth day of the first moneth] Soon after they had begun to cast
lots, verse 7.

and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded] Right or
wrong, that was never once questioned by these over-officious Officers. If the
King command it, and Haman will have it so, the Secretaries and Rulers, (those
servile souls) are ready to say, as Tiberius once did to Justinus. Si tu
volueris, ego sum; si tu non vis, ego non sum. Or as he in Lucan did to Caesar.
Jussa sequi, tam velle mihi, quam posse, necesse. We are wholly at your
devotion and dispose. We are only your clay and wax, etc. It is not for us to
take upon us as Counselors, but only to write what is dictated unto us, etc.
But this was no sufficient excuse for them before God: as neither was it for
Doeg, that he was commanded to slay all the Lords Priests, which Abner and
other of Saul's servants rightly and stoutly refused to do, 1 Samuel 22. A warrant
once came down under seal for Lady Elizabeth's execution, whilst she was
prisoner at Woodstock; Steven Gardener, like another Haman, being the chief
Engineer. But Mr. Bridges her Keeper, mistrusting false play, presently made
haste to the Queen, who renounced and reversed it. So might Ahashuerus happily
have done this bloody Edict, had his officers showed him the iniquity of it.
But they took not this to be any part of their business: Or if any one of them
should be more conscientious, yet he might be surprised by a sudden onset, as
the Lord Cromwell, when by the instigation of Gardener, he was commanded by
King Henry the eighth, to read the sentence of death against Lambert the
Martyr, whereof he repented afterward, sending for Lambert, and asking him
forgiveness, as Mr. Fox relates.

And to every people after their language] See chap. 1.22.

In the name of the King Ahashuerus] For more authority sake, and that Hamans
malice and cruelty might lie hid under the Kings cloak. So Jezabel wrote
letters in Ahabs name against Naboth; so the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites
in the name of their King; the Jews pretended to be all for Caesar, when they
sought and sucked our Saviors blood. The Popish Persecutours here did all in
Queen Mary's name, when as it might be said of her, as Josephus does of Queen
Alexandra among the Jews, Ipsa solum nomen regium ferebat, etc. She had the
name only of Queen, but the Pharisees ruled the Kingdom, so did the Bishops in
those days: and some of them would have done the like in ours, and that was
their downfall; after that, as rotten teeth, they had put the King and Kingdom
to a great deal of misery.

And sealed it with the Kings ring] Lest it should by any means be reversed,
Dan. 6.8, 12, 15. Of the right antiquity, use and matter of rings, let them
that will, read Plin. lib: 33. cap. 1. and 37.1. Macrob. lib. 1. Saturn. cap.
13. Alexand. ab Alex. lib. 2. genial. dier. Rhodig. lib. 6. cap. 12.

Verse 13. And the letters were sent by Postes] These, the Persians called
Angari, or (as Ruffin writes it) Aggari. But why was this done in such
post-haste, so long before the day of execution? was it not to hold them all
that while on the rack, and so to kill them peece-meale, (as Tiberius used to
do by his enemies,) whilst through fear of death, and expectation of that
doleful day, Heb 2.15.
they were all their lifetime subject to bondage?

To destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish] Words written not with black, but
with blood; and therefore multiplied in this sort, to show, that it mattered
not how, so they were made away by any means, and the world well rid of them.
Read the History of the French Massacre: and hear Reverend Merlin, (who
narrowly, and indeed miraculously escaped those bloody Villains, as being
Chaplain to the Admiral, and praying with him in his Chamber a little before
he was murdered,) hear him, I say, commenting upon this text; Sic nostro
saeculo, si scribenda fuerint edicta adversus Religionem, non potuerunt sibi
Scribae satisfacere in excogitandis verbis significantibus, quibus atrociora
and magis sanguinaria redderentur, etc. that is, in our age also, if any edicts
are to be written against Religion, the Secretaries cannot satisfy themselves
in devising significant words, whereby those edicts may be rendered the more
cruel and sanguinary.

All Jews, both young and old, little children and women] All ages, sizes, and
sexes. What could the devil himself have added to this abhorred cruelty, if it
had gone on? such a slaughter made Doeg at Nob; the Sicilians at their bloody
vespers; the King of France with the Templars throughout his Kingdom; Minerius
the Popes Champion, with the Protestants of Merindol and Chabriers, (besides
that of the Parisian Massacre beforementioned, and by Merlin upon this verse
graphically described, like as that of Babylon is by Jeremy, chap. 51.34.) what
a woeful slaughter had here been made, had Faux but fired the powder? What an
Acheldama had this whole Land been turned into in a few days space? Necdum
interiit saevus Hamani animus. Neither yet is Haman dead, but reviveth daily in
his bloody and blasphemous successors. That like as one says of Cain, the
devils Patriarch, there are not a few that still carry about, adore and worship
as a sacred thing, Cains club, Bucholc.
red with the blood of Abel: so it is here.

Even upon the thirteenth day] that it was to be no sooner done, was by a
special Providence of God, that ere that time came, it might be happily
prevented, as was before noted. See verse 7. Hamans folly also was not a little
seen in deferring the execution so long: for how knew he what a day might bring
forth? it was indeed mirabile simulque miserabile dictu, as one says, a
wonderful, and withal a miserable thing, that none should be found among the
Persians, Medes and Chaldees, to pity this poor people, and to intercede for
them. To have spoken to Haman for them, might likely have been as bootlesse, as
once it was to Minerius in the behalf of the Merindolians. Of whom when a few
had escaped his all-devouring sword, and he was entreated to give them quarter
for their lives, he sternely answered, I know what J have to do, Act. and Mon.
869.
not one of them shall escape my hands; I will send them to dwell in hell among
the devils, But if Haman resolved no better, yet what knew he, but that in time
the King might relent and repent of that rash and wretched edict, as he did?

Nam faciles motus men's generosa capit. Ovid.
We read in our Chronicles, that when King Henry the third had given
commandment, for the apprehending of Hubert de Burgo Earl of Kent, he fled
into a Church in Essex. They to whom the business was committed, finding him
upon his knees before the High-Altar, with the Sacrament in one hand, and a
Cross in the other, carried him away nevertheless unto the Tower of London.
The Bishop taking this to be a great violence and wrong to the Church, would
never leave the King, until he had ca^sed the Earl to be carried to the place
whence he was fetched. This was done: and although order was taken he should
not 'scape thence; yet it gave the Kings wrath a time to cool, and himself
leisure to make proof of his innocence. By reason whereof he was afterward
restored to the Kings favor and former places of honor. And the like befell
these Jews, are the thirteenth of Adar: but Haman, blinded with pride and
superstition, could not foresee it.

And to take the spoil of them for a prey] To be sure that none should 'scape,
the goods of the slain are proposed for a reward to them that should slay them,
and how far that would prevail with many covetous wretches, (...).
who knows not? Covetousness is daring and desperate: how much more when it
is encouraged, as here, by a Permission, nay, a Precept from the King, and his
chief Favorite? where we may be sure, the wealthier any man was, the sooner he
should have been sent out of the world, as a tree with thick and large boughs
is most likely to be lopped. Trithemius tells us, that the Templars
abovementioned were massacred by Philip the Fair, King of France, upon
pretext of heresy: but indeed, because they were rich, and Philip sore longed
after their possessions. The Cyprians for their great wealth became a spoil to
the Romans.

-- Quid non mortalia pectora cogis,
Auri sacra fames?
Verse 14. The copy of the writing -- was published] Phathsegin, a Syriack
word, says R. David, and not found, but in the books about the captivity. The
vulgar renders it Summa, R. Nathan (...), to the same sense. Transcripts of
the Original were sent to all places, that none might be ignorant or negligent
in doing execution: But why did not the Jews upon such notice save themselves
by flight, may some say? Alas, whither should the poor souls fly with their
families? being compassed about with so many deadly enemies, and having none
that durst own them in that distress? It was a just wonder, and a special work
of God, that their enemies forbear to fall upon them before the black-day came,
if but for the spoile-sake. We read chap. 9. that notwithstanding the known
favor of the King, the patronage of Mordecai, and the hanging up of Haman,
etc. the thirteenth of Adar is still meant to be a bloody day. Hamans Abettours
join together to perform that sentence, whereof the Author repented, etc.
But God was seen in the Mount: he loves to help those that are forsaken of
their hopes, as he did these poor Prisoners then, when it might seem that there
was neither left unto them hope of better, or place of worse Who would not
therefore trust in God? Deo confisi nunquam confusi? Trust in God will surely
triumph.

That they should be ready against that day] That long-look't-for day by Haman
and his Party, wherein they meant to roll themselves, and wallow in the blood
of those Jews, and to say as Hannibal did, when he saw a ditch filled with
man's blood, O jucundum spectaculum! O pleasant sight! Or as Valesus, when he
had slain three hundred, O rem regiam! O Kingly act! Or as that Queen, who when
she saw some of her Protestant subjects lying dead and stripped upon the earth,
cried out, the goodliest tapestry that ever she beheld! Are not such
blood-suckers of the vulturine kind, spoken of in Job, whose young ones
glut-glut blood, (the Original word seems made from the sound) and where the
slain are, there is she? Job 39.30.

Verse 15. The Posts went out, being hastened by the Kings commandment] As if
the enemy had been at the gates, and his crown had hanged on the one side of
his head: he could not have been more earnest and diligent in such a case, then
now he is. So much set upon it are Gods enemies, to bring their evil purposes to
pass; that till then, neither themselves nor others, can be suffered to rest
for them. Quicquid volunt, valde volunt, bearing down with crest and breast
whatsoever stands in the way of their sinful lusts. What a shame is it then for
Saints, not to be zealous of good works, valiant for the truth, and violent for
the Kingdom?

And the decree was given in Shushan the Palace] Pependit, says the Vulgar, it
hung up upon the posts to be read of all, the King not shaming to have his
privities seen, (as the phrase is, Ezra 4.14) to traduce himself (as it were)
in a public theater, for a foolish and oppressive Prince^ neither caring what
might be the evil consequents thereof, so that he may satisfy his own lust,
and gratify his minion.

And the King and Haman sat down to drink] So to drown the noise of
conscience, (if not altogether dead and dedolent) and so to nourish their
hearts as in a day of slaughter. Thus Joseph's brethren, when they had cast him
into the pit, sat down to eat bread, Genesis 37.25. (when it had been fitter for
them to have wept for their wickedness.) So did the Israelites when they had
made them a golden calfe, Exodus 32.6. Mat. 14.
Herod feasteth, when he had cast the Baptist into prison. The Antichristian
rout, revel and riot, when they had slain the two witnesses. Rev. 11. The Pope
proclaimed a Jubilee upon the Parisian Massacre. The King of France swore, that
he never smelled any thing more sweet then the Admirals carcass, when it stank
with long lying. As for his head, Epit. Hist. Gallic. speed.
he sent it for a present to the Queen Mother. And she balming it, sent it to
her holy Father the Pope for an assurance of the death of his most capital
enemy. Thua^us writes that the Pope caused that Massacre to be painted in his
Palace: Had the Powder Plot succeeded, it should have been pourtrayed (surely)
in his Chapel or Oratory. Faux was to get into the fields to see the sport;
for they made no other reckoning, but that all was their own. No more did the
King and Haman here, and hence their jollity, but it proved somewhat otherwise.
God often suffers his enemies to have the ball on the foot, till they come to
the very goal, and yet then to make them to miss the game: He loves to make
fools of them, to let them go to the utmost of their tedder, and then to pull
them back with shame to their task.

But the City Shushan was perplexed] That is, the Jews that dwelt there:
together with the rest that loved them, and wished well to them. These wept,
says the Vulgar Latin, were in heaviness, say others, they were intricated,
insnarled, at their wits end, so that they knew not what to do, (as the word
here g^i^^eth) only their eyes were toward the hills, from whence should come
their help. Their comfort was to consider, that melior est tristitia iniqua
patiemis, quam laetitia iniqua faelentes. August.
Better is the perplexity of him that suffers evil, then the jollity of him
that does evil. Deliverance would come they believed, chap. 4.14. but whence
they knew not. Hard things may be mollified, crooked things streightened, Non
omnium dierum sol occidit: Whiles there is a Sun to set, I will not despair of
a good issue, as Queen Elizabeth said when she was most perplexed, as being to
be sent Prisoner to the Tower, Engl. Eliz^
then the which never went any thing nearer to her heart.

CHAP. IV. Verse. 1. When Mordecai perceived all that was done]
(...), says Josephus, when he had learned or fully informed himself, Jadang.
so that he knew it to be so, as the Hebrew text has it. Sollicitous he was of
the Churches welfare, and sat listening, as Eli did once, what would become of
the Ark. 1 Samuel 3.13. (...).
Now therefore (as ill news is swift of foot, says Sophocles, and comes like
ill weather, before it be sent for) Mordecai takes knowledge of that bloody
decree, though Esther and those about her had not heard of it, ver. 4, 5.
Neither sits he still at home, as desponding and despairing, or seeks by
sinister practices to help himself and his people, but applies himself, First,
to God by hearty humiliation and prayer; And then to the King, by the
intercession of Esther. A carnal heart would have taken other shifting courses;
like as a dog that has lost his Master, will follow after any other for relief.

Mordecai rent his clothes] To show that his very heart was rent with sorrow
for Sion. This custom of renting their clothes in time, and in token of
greatest grief, was in use not among the Jews only, but Persians also, and
other Nations, Herod l. 3. and 9. Curt. l. 3, 4. and 11.
as is noted by Herodotus and Curtius.

And put on sackcloth] The courseft clothing he could get: as holding any
clothes too good for so vile a caiti^^ and showing, that but for shame he would
have worn none. So the Ninivites sat in sackcloth and ashes, for more
humiliation. See Exodus 33.4. etc.

And (...)] He put on ashes or dust, that is a dusty garment sprinkled with
ashes, says (...) his mouth in the dust, as L^^. 3.20 acknowledging himself to
be of the earth earthy, and fit fuel for hell fire. None (...) e terra
desumptum pulrerem notar. Merlin.


And went out into the midst of the City] That he might be a pattern to others.
Si vis me flere, etc.

And cried with a loud and bitter cry] More ^ar^arico, after the manner of that
country; but there was more in it then so. It was not his own danger that so
much affected him, (how gladly could he have wished with Ambrose, that God
would please to turn all the adversaries from the Church upon himself, and let
them satisfy their thirst with his blood?) as that so many innocent people
should perish. This made him lift up his voice unto God on High. On (...).
Joseph.


Verse 2. And (...) even before the Kings gate] Which should have been always
open to poor Petitioners, (as the gate of the Roman Aedilis was) but was now
shut against such Mourners as Mordecai. A nightcap was an ill sight at Court:
Jolly spirits cannot endure sadness: so great enemies they are to it, that
they banish all seriousness, like as the Nicopolites so hated the braying of
an Ass, that for that cause they would not abide to hear the sound of a
trumpet.

For none might enter into the Kings gate clothed with sackcloth] Behold, they
that wear softs are in Kings houses, Mat. 11.8. and those that are altogether
set upon the merry pin. Jannes and Jambres (those Juglers) are gracious with
Pharaoh, when Moses and Aaron are frowned upon. Baals Prophets are fed at
Jezabels Table, when Elias is almost pined in the desert. (...). Mat. 14.6.
The dancing Damosel trippeth on the toe, and triumphs in Herod's Hall, when
the rough-coated Baptist lies in cold irons: and Christ's company there is
neither cared for, nor called for, unless it be to show tricks, and do
miracles for a pastime, Luke 23.8. The Kings and Courtiers of Persia must see
no sad sight, lest their mirth should be marred, and themselves surprised with
heaviness and horror. But if Mourners might not be suffered to come to Court,
why did those proud Princes so sty up themselves, and not appear abroad for the
relief of the poor oppressed? How much better the modern Kings of Persia; whom
I have seen (says a certain Traveller) to alight from their horses; to do
justice to a poor body? How much better the great Turk, who whenever he goes
forth by land, does always ride on horseback, upon the Friday especially,
(which is their Sabbath) when he goes to the Temple. At which times they that
go along by his Stirrup, have charge to take all Petitions that are preferred
to his Majesty, and many poor men, who dare not presume by reason of their
ragged apparel to approach near, stand afar off with fire upon their heads,
holding up their Petitions in their hands; the which the grand Signior seeing,
(who never despises, but rather encourages the poor) sends immediately to
take the Petitions, and being returned home into his Seraglio, reads them all,
and then gives order for redress, as he thinks fit. By reason of which
complaints, the King oft-times takes occasion suddenly to punish his greatest
officers, either with death or loss of place. Grand. Sign. Serag. 148.
Which makes the Bashaws and other great Officers, that they care not how
seldom the grand Signior stirs abroad in public, for fear lest in that
manner their bribery and injustice should come to his ears. It Is probable that
Haman had got this also to be decreed, that none should enter into the Kings
gate clothed in sackcloth; lest passion might be moved thereby in any of the
Courtiers, or that be a means to make a complaint to the King of his cruelty.

Verse 3. And in every Province] Heb. In every Province, and Province, etc. not
only in Susan (which (say the Hebrews) was called Elam Hammedina) but
throughout the Kings dominions.

Whither soever the Kings Commandment and his Decree] The latter was
irrevocable, and therefore more dreadful.

There was great mourning among the Jewes] Not murmuring or mutinying, or
meditating revenge against the King and Haman, Not casting away their
confidence in God, or committing all to fate and blind fortune. Not crying out
of Religion as unhappy to the Professors ((...), said he in the story. O
miserable virtue! O practice of no profit, Brutus apud Di^^.
etc.) Not taking up arms or betaking themselves to flight (how should poor
gally slaves at this day fly out of the middle of (Turkey?) prayers and tears
were the weapons of these condemned captives caitives. It troubled them
exceedingly, (as well it might) that through fearfulness and negligence they
had not, ere this, gone back to their own country, with Zerubabel or some
other, when they had good leave to have gone with their brethren, and God
himself cried out unto them, Hoc, hoe, come forth, etc. Zach. 2.6. Mich^. 10.
Arise, (...) your rest, because it is polluted* it shall destroy you, even
with a sore destruction. This was now a (...) their hearts: like as it shall be
one day to those in hell, to think we might have been delivered.

And fasting] The word signifies an abstinence from food and sustenance,
either a toto, as 2 Samuel 12.16. Or at least a tanto and a tali, as Dan. 10.2,
3. Hence it is called a day of restraint, Joel 2.15. Hence Zech. 8.19. they
separated themselves, viz. from work, meat and delights, for the furtherance of
their repentance, (...).
and the enforcing of their prayers. Preces nobis jejunits alendum, and quasi
saginandum, says one, our prayers must be pampered and corne-fed with fasting.
A practice in use, not among Jews and Christians only, but among Egyptian
Priests, Persian Magi, and Indian wizards of old, and Turks to this day when
they are in any great fear or pressure.

And weeping and wailing] This was the way to get in with God, though they
might not come crying to the Court. Oh the divine Rhetoric and omnipotent
efficacy of penitent tears! Psalm. 6.8. Weeping has a voice. Christ turned to
the weeping women, when going to his Cross, and comforted them. He showed
great respects to Mary Magdalene, that weeping Vine; she had the first sight of
the revived Phoenix. (though so bleared that she could scarce discern him) and
held him fast by those feet which she had once washed with her tears, and
wherewith he had lately trod upon the lion and adder, Psalm. 91.13.

And many lay in sackcloth and ashes] As many as were more deeply affected with
their sins, and the sad consequents thereof. David lay on the bare ground,
(...).
2 Samuel 12.16. these and those, Joel 1.13. lodged in sackcloth and ashes, that
they might watch as well as fast: see how they go linked together, Mark. 13.33.
See verse 17.

Verse 4. So Esthers maids came and told it her] She her self (say
Interpreters) was kept in a closer place then they, not having the liberty of
going abroad, as others had: because the Persians that were of highest quality,
used so to keep in their wives; and if they went forth at any time, they were
carried in a close chariot, so as that none could see them.

Then was the Queen exceedingly grieved] Dolens exhorruit. So Tremellius. The
Hebrew is, She grieved her self, scil. for Mordecai's heaviness, as our
Savior when he heard of the death of his friend Lazarus, groaned in spirit,
and troubled himself, Joh. 11.33. And here we see that of Plautus disproved.
Mulier nulla cordicitus dolet ex anime. that is, No woman can grieve heartily
for any thing. Holy Esther is here sick at heart of grief, as the word
imports: and yet (as one says of the Lady Jane Gray,) she made grief it self
amiable: her night-clothes becoming her as well as her day-dressings, by reason
of her gracious deportment.

And she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai] That he might be fit to come unto
her, and make known the cause of his grief, for she yet knew nothing of the
public calamity. And although she were so highly advanced above Mordecai, yet
she condoleth with him, and honors him as much as ever. This was true
friendship. Ego aliter amare non didici, said Basil, to one that disliked him
for stooping so low to an old friend.

And to take away the sackcloth, etc.] To change his saccum in sericum,
sackcloth into satin, etc. See verse 2.

But he received it not] Such was the greatness of his grief which he could
not dissemble: such was his care of community, that he could not mind his own
private concernments, whiles it went ill with the public. Romans 2.7.
Such also was his patient continuance in well-doing, that he would not give
over asking of God till he had received, seeking till he had found, knocking
till the gate of grace was opened. His clothes were good enough, unless his
condition were more comfortable.

Verse 5. Then called Esther for Hatach] She snuffeth not at Mordecai's refusal
of her courtesy. She says not, Let him choose, the next offer shall be worse,
Rerum suarum satagat, si velit, and valeat, etc. Solomon reckons among those
four things that the earth cannot bear, an handmaid advanced to the state and
place of a Mistress. Prove. 30. Sen. epist.
But Esther was none such. In her you might have seen magnitudinem cum
mansuetudine, as Seneca has it, singular humility in height of honors. She
calls here for Hatach a faithful servant, and perhaps a Jew, a Jew inwardly.
Honesty flows from piety.

One of the Kings Chamberlaines] Heb. Eunuchs or gelded men; such as used to
keep their women in Kings Courts. The Chaldees call them Rabrebanim, that is,
Grandees. The Persians call them Spadones, says Stephanus. The Greeks,
Eunuchs; (...).
either because they were Princes Chamberlaines, and had the custody of their
beds: or because they were egregie cordati homines, well-minded men: for they
generally proved (as likewise now they do among the Turks) subjects, though not
of great courage, yet of the greatest judgment and fidelity, their minds
being set on business, rather then on pleasure.

Whom he had appointed to attend upon her.] Heb. Whom he had set before her, in
obsequium and servitium, to be at her beck and obedience: probably, he was
happy in such a service, for goodness is communicative, and of a spreading
nature. Plutarch says of the neighbor-villages of Rome in Numa's time, that
sucking in the air of that City, they breathed (...), righteousness and
devotion: so it might very well be here. It was so with Abraham's servants, and
Solomon's, and Cornelius's, Acts 10.7. Nero complained (and no wonder) that he
could never find a faithful servant. What could they learn from him, but
villainy and cruelty?

And gave him a commandment to Mordecai] i.e. She commanded him to deliver her
mind to Mordecai. A servant is not to be inquisitive, ( John 15.15. he knows
not what his Lord does but executive, ready to do what is required of him. He
is the Masters instrument, (...).
and wholly his, says Aristotle. The hands must take counsel of the head, and
be stir them.

To know what it was, and why it was] Some great matter she well knew it must
needs be, that put him to those loud laments. Wise men cry not till they are
sorely hurt. Jobs stroke was heavier then his groaning, Job 23.2. He was not of
those that are ever whining: like some men's flesh, if their skin be but razed
with a pin, it presently rankleth and festereth; or like rotten boughs, if a
light weight be but hung on them, they presently creak and break. Mordecai she
knew was none such. She therefore sends to see what was the matter, that she
might help him, if possible. The tears and mones of men in misery are not to
be slighted, as if they were nothing to us. Who is afflicted, 2 Cor 11. Romans
12.
and I burn not, says Paul? Weep with those that weep, else you add to their
grief; as the Priest and Levite did, by passing by the wounded man: Is it
nothing to you, O ye that pass by the way, Lam. 1.12? Are not ye also in the
body, Heb. 13.3. that is, in the body of flesh and frailty, subject to like
afflictions? And may not your sins procure their sufferings, as a vein is
opened in the arm, to ease the pain of the head?

Verse 6. So Hatach went forth to Mordecai] He was obedient to his
Queen-mistriss, pleasing her in all things, not answering again, Tit. 2.10.
unless it were, I will, or the like. Servus sit monosyllabus Domino. Apelles
painted a servant with Hindes feet, to run on his Masters errands: with Asses
ears, and with his mouth made fast with two locks, to signify that he should
be swift to hear, slow to speak.

Unto the street of the City] The Broad-street, as the word signifies: there
Mordecai kept him, Rechob. (...) latitudiue, voomth.
and might not come nearer the Court, because a Mourner. See verse 2. Tiberius
the Emperor, counterfeiting grief at the Funeral of Drusus, there was a v^ile
laid betwixt the dead and him because being High Priest forsooth, he might not
see any mournful object. The Statues of the gods were transported or covered
(for like cause) in those places where any punishment was inflicted. But what
says the wise man? The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, (whereby
we must understand any place or object, which occasioneth mourning) but the
heart of fools is in the house of mirth, Eccles. 7.4.

Verse 7. And Mordecai told him all that had happened unto him] Not by fate or
blind fortune, (...).
(and yet time and chance happens to all, Eccles. 9.11. and it was by chance
to the wounded man, that the Priest and the Levite came down that way, Luke
10.31.) but by the Providence of God, which has an hand in ordering the most
casual and fortuitous events, to the execution of his righteous counsels:
neither is there ever a Providence, but we shall once see a wonder, or a mercy
wrapped up in it.

And of the sum of money] See chap. 3.9. Money is the Monarch of this present
world. Money is to many dearer then their heart-blood, yet to gratify their
lusts, they lavish silver out of the bag, and care not to purchase revenge or
sensual delights, with misery, beggary, discredit, damnation.

Verse 8. Also he gave him the copy of the writing] That she might see it, and
rest assured, that it was even so, and no otherwise: and that therefore now or
never she must bestir her self for the laboring Church.

That was given at Shushan] Which if ever it were full of judgment, and white
as a lilie, (according to the name) is now stained with blood of innocents. if
ever righteousness did lodge in it, yet now murderers, as Esaias. 1.21.

To show it unto Esther] That her eye might affect her heart, and her heart set
all awork for her people, that is, her self, according to that Physician heal
thy self; Lam. 3. Luke 4.
that is thine own Countrymen.

And to declare it unto her] In the cause, viz. his refusing to bow to Haman
against his conscience, (whereof it no whit repented him) and in the several
circumstances laid forth in the liveliest colors, for her thorough-information.

And to charge her that she should go in unto the King] Hoc perquam durum est,
sedita lex scripta est, says the Civilian. This Mordecai knew would hardly be
done: he therefore makes use of his ancient authority, and sets it on with
greatest earnestness. So Saint Paul, I charge you by the Lord, 1 These. 5.27.
And again, I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, etc. 2 Timothy 4.1.
So Saint Austin to his hearers, Per tremendum Dei judicium vos adjuro, I
require and charge you by that dreadful day of judgment, when that doomes-day
book shall be opened, etc. It is a weakness to be hot in a cold matter, but it
is a wickedness to be cold in a hot matter. He that is earnest in good, though
he may carry some things indiscreetly, yet is he far better then a time-server,
and a cold friend to the truth: like as in falling forward is nothing so much
danger, as in falling backward. Eli was too blame with his Do no more so my
sons. And so was Jehoshaphat with his Let not the King say so. And the people
in Ahabs time, who when they were pressed to express whom they were for, God
or Baal? they answered not a word, 1 Kings 18.21. And yet how many such cold
friends has the truth now adays? Lukewarm Laodiceans, Neuter-passive
Christians, etc? When Callidus once declared against Gallus with a faint and
languishing voice; Oh (says Tully) Tu nisi fingeres, sic ageres? Would thou
plead on that manner, if thou were in good earnest? Men's faint appearing for
Gods cause shows they do but feign: their coldness probably concludes they
do but counterfeit. Mordecai plays the man, and charge Esther to improve her
interest in the King her husband, for the Churches deliverance. See here how he
turns every stone, tradeth every talent, leaves no means unused, no course
unattempted for the Saints safety. And this the Spirit of God has purposely
recorded, that all may learn to lay out themselves to the utmost for the
public; to be most zealous for the conservation and defense of the Church,
when it is afflicted and opposed by Persecutours; seeing they cannot be saved,
unless she be in safety; neither can they have God for their Father, unless
they love and observe this their dear mother. Vtinam, iterum autem utinam
diligentius a cunctis ordinibus haec hodie considerarentur, says one. Cypr.
Aut. l. de unit. Eccles.
Oh that these things were duly considered by all sorts now adays.

To make supplication unto him] Heb. to deprecate displeasure and mischief, as
1 Kings 8.28. Zech. 12.10.

And to make request before him] Ad quaerendum a facie ejus; so Pagnine from
the Hebrew, to seek for good from his face, an effectual smile, a gracious
aspect, that they may live in his sight. For in the light of the Kings
countenance is life, and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain, Prove.
16.15. The ancient Persian Kings were most fond of their wives, doing them all
the honor possible in Court, as Partakers of all their fortunes, and carried
them and their children into their farthest wars: by the presence of so dear
pledges, the more to encourage their minds in time of battle. Now therefore
Esther (whom Herodotus also witnesses to have been Xerxes his best beloved) is
to try what she can do with him for her people, who were happily grown too secure
upon Esthers preferment: as the French Churches also were upon the Queen of
Navarres greatness, and the promise of peace by that match. God therefore
shortly after shook them up, (not by shaking his rod only at them, as here at
these Jews, but) by permitting that bloody Massacre.

Verse 9. And Hatach came, and told Esther] He acted the part of a faithful
messenger: so must Ministers those servants of the Churches, declare unto the
people all the mind of God, Acts 20.27. and not steal Gods word every one from
his neighbor, Jer. 23.30. not deal deceitfully with it, but as of sincerity,
but as of God, in the sight of God, let them speak in Christ; and let them
speak out, not fearing any colors. He that has my Word, let him speak my Word
faithfully, says God, Jer. 23.28. Aarons Bells were all of gold, the Trumpets
of the Sanctuary were of pure silver: they did not (as those inverse Trumpets
of Furius Fulvius sound a retreat, when they should have sounded an alarm: No
more must Gods Messengers. Whatsoever the Lord says unto me, 1 Cor. 11. Heb.
3.5.
that will I speak, says Michaiah. Paul; as he received what he delivered, so
he delivered whatsoever he received. Moses was faithful in all Gods house, etc.

Verse 10. Again, Esther spoke unto Hatach] Having before found him a fit and
faithful messenger she further employeth him: so those that minister well, do
purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is
in Christ Jesus, 1 Timothy 3.13. when others shall be laid by as broken vessels,
whereof there is not left a sheard to take fire from the hearth, or to take
water withal from the pit, as the Prophet has it, Esaias 30.14.

Verse 11. All the Kings servants] His Courtiers and Counselors, who happily
were as very slaves to him, Turk. Hist. 1153.
as now the greatest Lords of the Court are to the great Turk; no man having
any power over himself, much less is he Master of the house wherein he
dwells, or of the land which he tilleth, but is in danger of being whipped
upon the least displeasure of the Tyrant: especially if he be not a natural
Turk borne. Ibid. 361.


And the people of the Kings Provinces do know] i.e. All, both far and near,
this shows, that the Law here mentioned was no new Law procured by Haman, to
prevent Jewish Suppliants, as Lyra would have it, but long since made and known
to all the Kings subjects.

That whosoever, whether man or woman] Yea, though she be his dearest Consort,
who should cohabit with him, and not be sundred for a season, but by consent, 1
Cor. 7.5.

Shall come unto the King] The Persians usually hid their King, tanquam aliquod
sacrum mysterium, as some precious business, and that for two reasons; First,
for State and Authority, lest familiarity with their subjects should breed
contempt, and make them over-cheap. Philip the second King of Spain, was of
the same mind and practice. For after that he had gotten into his hands the
Kingdom of Portugal, and therewith the wealth of the Indies, inclusit se in
Curiale, he shut up and immured himself in his Court, Val. Max. Christ.
and was seldom seen of any, though never so great a man, but upon long suit,
and as a singular favor. This made him to be adored as a demi-god. Secondly
for security and safety, lest if all should be suffered to come that would, the
King should be assassinated and made away, as Eglon was by Ehud, Ishbosheth. by
Baanah and Rechab, Gedaliah by Ishmael, and many Kings of Israel and Emperors
of Rome were by their own servants. The Turks at this day suffer no stranger to
come into the Presence of their Emperor, but first they search him that he
have no weapon: and so clasping him by the arms, Turk. Hist.
under color of doing him honor, dissemblingly they bereave him of the use of
his hands, lest he should offer him any violence: yet has he always as he
sits in his throne, lying at hand ready by him, a target, a scimiter, an
iron mace, with bow and arrows.

-- Sors ista tyrannis
Muriti ut gladiis vivant, cinctique venenis.
How much better Agesilaus King of Spartans, who walked daily among his
subjects, doing justice, Xenoph. orat. de Agesil.
and is therefore by Xenophon worthily preferred before this stately King of
Persia? how much better Queen Elizabeth, who often showed her self to her
people, and cheerfully received nosegayes, flowers, rosemary from mean persons.
She got the hearts of her subjects (which Philip of Spain, her stately
Contemporary never could do) by coupling mildness with Majesty, and stooping,
yet in a stately manner, to those of low condition. So reserved she was, that
all about her stood in a reverent awe of her very presence and aspect, but much
more of her least frown or check; wherewith some of them, Speed 1235.
who thought they might best presume of her favor, have been so suddenly
daunted and planet-stricken, that they could not lay down the grief thereof,
but in their graves.

There is one Law of his] A wretched Law it was, written not with black, but
with blood, and condemned by very heathens for barbarous and pernicious to the
public. For if the King may not be come at, but upon pain of death, what
shall become of the poor oppressed? and how shall he ever hear of the rapines
and other miscarriages of his Favorites and under Officers, by whom he shall
be even bought and sold, and himself never the wiser, as Aurelian the Emperor
complained Orpheus, that ancientest of Poets faineth, that Lite (or Petitions)
are Joves daughters, and ever conversant about his Throne. David heard the
woman of Tecoa. Solomon the two harlots, and King Joram the affamished woman
that called to him for justice, with Help O King. Philip of M^cedon ^ighted the
old wife that checked him for his neglect of her; and Trajan, the widow that
would not be put off till another time. Plutarch.
This was King-like; His office is to judge the people with righteousness, and
the poor with judgment. He shall judge the poor of the people, -- and break in
pieces the oppressor, Psalm. 72.2, 4.

To put him to death] (...) Athenaeus. No such danger in approaching Gods
Presence, he soliciteth suitours, and seeks such as may come before him John
4.23. This was anciently figured by the door of the Tabernacle, not made of any
hard or debarring matter, but of a veil easily penetrable: which also now is
rent, Psalm. 65.2. 1 Timothy 2.8.
to show our easy access to Him, who hears prayers, and wills that all
flesh come unto him, lifting up in all places pure hands, without warth, and
without doubting.

Except such to whom the King shall hold out the golden Scepter] In token that
he called for them. Thus whom he would be slew, and whom he would he kept
alive; as Dan 5.19. But Esther should (as afterward she did) have trusted God
with her life; and with a Roman resolution have said, Necasse est ut eam, non
ut vivam. It is necessary, that I venture, not that I live. That she was
fearful when her life lay upon it, we may impute to the weakness of her sex,
or rather of her faith; against which sense fights sore, when it is upon its own
dunghill; I mean, in a sensible danger. Natures retraction of it self from a
visible fear, may cause the pulse of a Christian, that beats truly and
strongly in the main point (the state of the soul) to intermit and faulter at
such a time. Abraham showed some, trepidation, and Peter much more.

But I have not been called to come in to the King these thirty dayes] There
was hot love the while, his concubines, perhaps, had engrossed him. Doves are
said to draw the charet of Venus: and those neither change their mates, not
forsake their company. Haman was all the doer, now about the King, as our King
Richard the second his Favorites, Knights of Venus rather then Bellona, says
the Chronicler, conversing with the King, not without suspicion of foul
familiarity, as Walsingham writes, Speed. 746.
Sodomitica labe infecti, fere emnes, says another.

Verse 12. And they told to Mordecai Esthers words] See the Note on verse. 9.
She would have been her own Messenger, but might not. The greatest are not
always the happiest. The Lady Elizabeth once wished her self a merry milkmaid.

Verse 13. Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther] He would not take her
excuse, but seems to say unto her, as one once did to a Philosopher, that in a
great tempest at sea asked many trifling questions. Are we perishing, and do
thou trifle? Aul. Gell.
So, Do thou cast off the tare of community, (...).
and provide for no more then thine own safety?

Think not with thy self, that thou shall escape in the Kings house] Any more
then Serena that Christian Empress, wife to Dioclesian did, or Eliz. Queen of
Denmark, glad to fly for her life, because a Lutheran; or Queen Katharine
Parre, who hardly escaped the fire by the favor of her husband Henry the
eighth: Sure it is, that the fear of man brings a snare (as fearful birds
and beasts fall into the Hunters toil) but he that trusts in the Lord, (as
good Mordecai did, and as he would have Esther to do) shall be safe, or shall
be set on high, out of harms way, his place of defense shall be munitions of
rocks, Esaias 38.15. Like as the coney, that weak, but wise creature, Prove.
30.24, 26. Prove. 29.25.
) flies to the holes in the r^cks; and does easily avoid the dogs that pursue
her; when the Hare that trusts to the swiftness of her legs, is at length
overtaken, and torn in pieces.

More then all the Jewes] The Law was general and irreversible* Darius sought
to deliver Daniel, and could not, And (...) (at once Medina's (...) in eighty
eight) sword knew no difference, nor would make any in that general Massacre;
like as in that at Paris, they poisoned the Queen of (...), murdered the most
part of the Peerlesse Nobility in France, their wives and children, with a
great sort of the common people.

Verse 14. But if thou altogether hold thy peace] And so make thy self
guilty of a sinful silence, nay, of the death of so many innocents! for not to
do good, when it is in the power of a man's hand, Qui non cum potest, servat;
occidit.
is to do evil, and not to save is to destroy, as our Savior shows, Mark
3.14. Passive wickedness is deeply taxed in some of those seven Churches, Rev.
2. and 3. In a storm at sea, it is a shame to fit still, or to be asleep with
Jonas in the sides of the ship, when it is in danger of drowning. Every man
cannot fit at the Stern; but then he may handle the ropes, or manage the
oars, etc. The self-seeker, the private-spirited man, may he be but warm in
his own feathers, regards not the danger of the house; he is totus inse, like
the snail, still within doors and at home, like the Squirrel, he ever digs his
hole toward the Sunrising: his care is to keep on the warm side of the
hedge, to sleep in a whole skin, to save one, whatever become of the many. From
doing thus, Mordecai deterreth Esther by an heap of holy arguments: discovering
an heroical faith, and a well-knit resolution.

At this time] There is indeed a time to keep silence, and a time to speak,
Eccl. 3.7. But if ever a man will speak, let him do it when the enemies are
ready to devour the Church: as Croesus his dumb son burst out into, Kill not
King Croesus. For Zions sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalems sake
I will not rest, etc. Esaias 62.1. If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right
hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the
roof of my mouth, etc. Psalm. 137.5, 6. That noble Terentius, (General to Valens
the Emperor) being bidden to ask what he would, asked nothing, but that the
Church might be freed from Arians; And when the Emperor, Niceph.
upon a defeat by the Goths, upbraided him with cowardice and sloth as the
causes of the overthrow, He boldly replied, Your self have lost the day, by
your warring against God, and persecuting his people.

Then shall their enlargement] Heb. Respiration, a day of refreshing should
come from the Presence of the Lord. Confer Job 9.18. At present they could
hardly breath, for bitterness of spirit.

And deliverance arise] Heb. stand up, as on its basis or bottom, so as none
shall be able to withstand. This, Mordecai speaks, not by a spirit of
Prophecy, but by the force of his faith, grounded upon the Promises of Gods
defending his Church, hearing the cries of his afflicted, arising to their
relief and succor, etc. Mira profecto at omnibus linguis, saeculis, ^^cisque
commendabilis fides, says one. A notable faith indeed, and worthy of highest
commendation. Thorough the Perspective of the Promises (those pabulum fidei,
food of faith) a believer may see deliverance at a great distance; (...).
see it and salute it, as those did. Heb. 11.13. What though Sense says, It
will not be; Reason, It cannot be: yet Faith gets above, and says, It shall
be, I descryland.

Italiam, Italiam laeto clamore salutar. Virg.
But thou and thy fathers house shall be destroyed] Here he thundereth and
threatens her, if to save her self she shall desert the Church. Mordecai's
message, like David's ditty, Psalm. 101.1.
is composed of discords. Sour and sweet make the best-sauce: Promises and
menaces mixed will soonest work. God told Abraham, that for the love he bare
him, Genesis 123.
he would bless those that blessed him, and curse such as cursed him. Their
sin should find them out, and they should rue it in their posterity. As one
fire, so one fear should drive out another.

And who knows whether thou art come to the Kingdom] There is often a wheel
within a wheel, Ezekiel. 1. God may have an end and an aim in businesses that we
wot not of, nor can see into, till event has explained it. Let us lay forth
our selves for him, and labor to be publike-spirited, such as fully satisfied
him. No man labor can be in vain in the Lord. to see which way we may most
glorify God, and gratify our brethren. (...) Phil, 1.20.


Verse 16. Thus Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer] A sweet answer,
and such as fully satisfied him. No man's labor can be in (...) in the Lord.
Good therefore and worthy of all acceptance is the wise man's counsel. In the
morning sow thy seed, (...) the (...) thy (...), for thou know not whether
shall prosper, either this (...) that, or whither they ^ath shall be alike
good, Eccles. 11.6 Mordecai had filled his mouth with Argument, and now God
filled his heart with comfort. Esther yields, and resolves to obey him,
whatever come of it; only she will go the wisest way to work, first seeking
God, and then casting herself upon the King. Ora and labora, God has all
hearts in his hand, and will grant good success to his suppliants.

Verse 16. Go gather together all the Jewes] Great is the power of joint
prayer, it stirs heaven, and works wonders. Oh when a Church-full of good
people shall set sides and shoulders to work, when they shall rouse up
themselves, and wrestle with God, when their pillars of incense shall come up
into his Presence, Rev. 14.1.
and their voices be heard as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a
great thunder, Rev. 14. What may not such thundering legions have at Gods hands?
Have it? they will have it: Coelum tundimus, preces fundimus, misericordiam
extorquemus, said those primitive Prayer-makers. Rev. 9.13. the prayers of the
Saints from the four corners of the earth sound, and do great things in the
world, they make it ring. It was the speech of a learned man, if there be but
one sigh come from a gracious heart (how much more then, a volley of sighs from
many good hearts together?) it fills the ears of God, so that God hears
nothing else.

And fast ye for me] Who am now upon my life, and for ought I know, am shortly
to appear before the Lord; (who requires to be sanctified in all them that
draw near unto him) and wherein I may not look to have leave to err twice. Non
licet in b^llo bis ^rr^re D. ^^all.
Point therefore your prayers for me with holy fasting, that they may pierce
heaven and prevail. Abstinence meriteth not, says a grave Divine, for Religion
consists not in the belly, either full or empty. (What are meats or drinks to
the Kingdom of God, which is, like himself, spiritual?) but it prepares best
for good duties. Full bellies are fitter for rest. Not the body so much as the
soul is more active with emptiness: Hence solemn prayer takes ever fasting
to attend it; and so much the rather speedeth in heaven; when it is so
accompanied. It is good so to diet the body, that the soul may be fattened.

And neither eat nor drink three days, etc.] That is, says Drusius, two whole
nights, one whole day, and part of two other days. See the like expression,
Mat. 12, 40. Others lay, that in those hot countries they might fast three
days, as well as we two in these cold climates. Tully in one of his Epistles
tells us, Epist. 10^.
that he fasted two days together, without so much as tasting a little water.
For the Romans also and Grecians had their Fasts private and public, whether
it were by a secret instinct of Nature, or by an imitation of the Hebrews,
Faciunt and vespae favos. The Turks likewise at this day precisely observe
their Fasts, and will not so much as taste a cup of water, Turk. Hist. 777.
or wash their mouths with water all the day long, before the stars appear in
the sky, be the days never so long and hot. The Hollanders and French fast, but
had need, says one, to send for those mourning women, Jer. 19.17. by their
cunning to teach them to mourn. The English are not sick soon enough, says
another, and they are well too soon: this is true of their minds as well as of
their bodies. Currat ergo poenitentia, ne praecurrat sententia: and let our
Fasts be either from morning till evening, Judge. 20.26. 2 Samuel 3.35. Or from
evening till evening, Levit. 23.32. or longer, as here. And Acts 9.9. As the
hand and wrath of God does more or less threaten us, U^quedum stollae in coelo
appareant.
or lie upon us. There is an old Canon that defines their continuance, Till
stars appear in the sky.

I also and my maids will fast] She her self would be in the head of them, as
Queen Elizabeth also told her soldiers at Tilbury Camp for their comfort: and
as Caesar used to say to his soldiers, Go we, and not Go ye; and as Joshua
said, Non ite, sed ea. mus. Josh. 14.15.
I and my house will serve Jehovah. Esthers maids must fast and pray, or they
are no maids for her.

And so will I go unto the King] It is said of Achilles, that he was Styge
armatus: But he that fasteth, prays, believes, Est coelo, Christo, Deo
armatus, armed with an undaunted resolution to obey God whatever come of it.

Which is not according to the Law] She slights not the Law, but waves it, to
obey Gods Law, and save her people.

And if I perish, I perish] This she speaks not rashly or desperately, Better
do worthily, and perish for a Kingdom, then unworthily. and perish with a
Kingdom.
as prodigal of her life, but as sacrificing the same to God and his cause,
thorough the obedience of faith, and saying, as that Martyr. Can I die but once
for Christ? See the like phrase, Genesis 43.14. with the Note there.

Verse 17. So Mardecai went his way, and did according, etc.] As he had put her
upon a dangerous, but, as the cause stood, necessary exploit, (Nature will
venture its own particular good for the general, as heavy things will ascend to
keep out vacuity, and preserve the Universe,) so he is ruled by her, (though a
woman, and once his pupil) when he perceived her counsel was good. Abraham must
hear Sarah, and David Abigail, and Apollos Priscilla, when they speak reason.
It is foretold of a man in Christ, that a little child shall lead him, Esa.
11.6.

CHAP. V. Verse 1. Now it came to pass on the third day]
THat is, Seder. Olam.
on the fifteenth day of the month Nissan, as the Hebrew Annals say. Cum adhuc
ferverent popularium suorum preces, (whiles the prayers of her Countrymen,
like those of Cornelius, Acts 10.4.) were come up for a memorial before God:
she takes her opportunity and speeds accordingly: she knew that sweet passage,
Psalm 145.18. The Lord is nigh to all that call upon him, to all that call
upon him in truth. He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him, he will
also hear their cry and will save them, etc. Joh. Manl. loc. Com. 142.
This she could afterward seal to and say, This poor soul cried, and the Lord
heard her, and saved her out of all her troubles, Psalm. 34.6, Luthers widow
confessed, that she never understood many of David's Psalms, till she was in
deep affliction.

That Esther put on her royal apparel] She knew that Hanc homines decorant,
quam vestimenta decorant. People are usually regarded as they are habited; and
good clothes conduce much to the setting forth of beauty to the best. Like a
right daughter of Sarah, she knew that the outward adorning, I Pet. 3.3, 5.
by plaiting the hair, wearing of gold, and putting on of apparel, would not
at all commend her to God, (in obedience to whom she had wanzed her face with
fasting, and trusted that he would put upon her his comeliness) But
considering that the King, her husband looked much at such things, she laid
aside her fasting-weeds, and put on her best, Ind uit se regno (so the Original
runs) she clothed her self in rich and royal array: as Queen Mary of England did
on her Coronation day: her head was so laden with precious stones, that she
could hardly hold it up, says the Story: and all things else were according.
Whether Esther came to the King, leaning upon one maid, and having another to
hold up her train, as Josephus has it, is uncertain. It Is likely she left her
Attendants without, lest she should draw them into danger: and contented her
self (when she went in to the King,) with those faithful companions, Faith,
Hope and Charity, who brought her off also with safety, according to Prove.
18.10. and 14.26.

And stood in the inner Court of the Kings house] A bold adventure
questionless, but the fruit of the prayer of faith, this was it that put
spirit and metal into her. What if she were Queen? so had Vasthi been, and yet
discarded for her disobedience. Besides, how could she tell, either what the
Kings mind toward her was (he had not seen her of a month, and if Haman knew
her to be a Jewesse, what would not he suggest against her? Or, what was the
mind of God, till he had signified it by the event? It was therefore an
heroical courage in Esther, proceeding from her says, which when it is driven
to work alone without sense, then God thinks it lies upon his credit to show
mercy.

Over against the Kings house] Where she might see him, and be seen by him.
This she did, Nec temere, Lib. 12.3. 1 Kings 10.18.
nec timide, which, says one, is the Christians Motto.

And the King sat upon his Royal Throne] Royal indeed, as Athenaeus describes
it. But yet short of Solomon's, much more of the Lord Christ's, supported and
surrounded with an innumerable company of Angels. It should be our earnest
desire to see this King of glory upon his Throne: to see him and enjoy him.
Austin wished that he might have seen three things, 1. Romam in flore. 2.
Paulum in ore. 3. Christum in corpore. Rome in the flourish, Paul in the
Pulpit, Christ in the flesh. Venerable Bede comes after, and correcting this
last wish, says, Imo vero Christum in solio sedentem. Let me see Christ upon
his Throne-royal rather. Esaias saw him so chapter 6.1. and took far more delight
therein, then the merry Greeks did or could do at their Olympic games,
celebrated at the same time, in the one thousand five hundred and fourtieth
year after the Flood, as the divine Chronologer computeth it. Bucholc. 541.


Verse 2. And it was so] God the great Heart-disposer so ordered it.

That when the King saw Esther the Queen, etc.] Beautified by God in a special
manner, as was Moses, Acts 7.20. Stephen, Acts 6.15, etc. And some faces we
know do appear most orientally fair, when they are most instamp't with sorrow.
(...).


That she obtained favor in his sight] Josephus says, that at first the King
frowned upon her, so that she fell into a swoon before him. Rex autem
voluntate, arbitror Dei, mentem mutavit, i. e. But the King as God would have
it, changed his mind, and cheared her up. How true this is, I know not; But
this I know, that the wrath of a King is as the roaring of a lion, which is so
terrible, that it astonieth all that hear it, Amb bex. l. 6. c. 5.
and that Omne trahit secum Caesaris ira malum. Sir Christopher Hatton, being
checked and threatened by Queen Elizabeth, died soon after: Neither could the
Queen, having once cast him down with her word only, raise him up again, though
she visited him, Camd. Eliz 406.
and comforted him. Esther here was soon raised and relieved.

Dejicit ut relevet, premit ut solatia praestet:
Enecat, ut possit vivificare Deus.
And the King held out to Esther the golden Scepter] He did not kick her out of
his Presence, as some Cambyses would have done, neither did he command her to
the block, as Henry the eighth did his Anne Bullen, upon a mere misprision of
disloyalty: neither yet did he cashiere her, as he had done Vashti for a less
offense: but, by holding out his Scepter shows his gracious respects unto her.
This was the Lords own work, as was likewise that of old, that Laban should
leave Jacob with a kiss, Esau meet him with a kiss, Genesis 33.4. where the word
kissed has a prick over each letter in the Original, to show the wonder of
Gods work in changing Esaus heart from his former hatred. Let a man's ways
please the Lord, and men shall quickly befriend him. This is compendiosissima
hominum gratiam consequendis via, says Lavater here, the readiest way to win
favor with all others. When David was once a man after Gods heart, whatsoever
he did, pleased the people.

So Esther drew near, and touched the top of his Scepter] With her hand, says
the Chaldee: with her mouth, says the Vulgar Translation. This she did either
in token of submission, or for the avoiding of danger; for, as Josephus says,
(...). Joseph. Col. 3.19.
He that touched the Kings Scepter, was out of the reach of evil. Wives should
submit themselves to their own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. Submission
includes Reverence, (in heart, speeches, gestures) and obedience to all their
husbands lawful commands and restraints. This is no more then is meet, says
the Apostle.

Verse 3. Then said the King unto her.] He perceived both by this her bold
adventure, and also by her countenance and habit, that she had some very great
suit to him. He therefore accosteth her (as the Lord did the Angel, Zech.
1.13.) with good words, and comfortable words. And this way one man may be an
Angel, nay, a God to another, Genesis 33.10. Indeed it is God that comfort by
the creature as by a conduit-pipe. The air yields light as an instrument,
the water may heart, but not of it self. The Lord put it into the heart of
Ahashuerus, to cheer up Esther in this sort: wherein also he did but his duty,
for no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even
as the Lord the Church; so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies;
He that loves his wife loves himself, Ephesians. 6.28, 29.

What will thou Queen Esther?] That he called her by her name, and with such an
honorable attribution, was a sign of no small favor. The hearts of Joseph's
brethren were so big swollen with spite and spleen, that they could not call him
by his name, but said, Behold, this dreamer, Genesis 37.19. (...). John 7.11.
So the Pharisees called our Savior, This fellow. And the Jews sought him at
the feast, and said, Where is he? they could not find in their hearts to say,
Where is Jesus? So Saul asked not for David, much less for his son-in-law
David, but for the son of Jesse, by way of contempt. Christ tells his disciples
that their enemies shall cast out their names for naught, Luke 6.22. and
charge them, courteously to salute their enemies, calling them friendly by
their names, Mat. 5.47.

And what is thy request?] q. d. Fear not to utter it, I am very earnest to
know it, and fully resolved to grant it. It was more troublesome to Severus the
Emperor to be asked nothing, then to give much. When any of his Courtiers had
not made bold with him, he would call him and say, Quid est cur nihil petes?
What meanest thou to ask me nothing? Hitherto ye have asked me nothing (says
the King of Saints to his beloved Esther) Ask that your joy may be full, John
16.24. he is worthily miserable, that will not make himself happy by asking.

It shall be given thee to the half of the Kingdom] A proverbial rather then a
prodigal speech, and much in this Kings mouth. If some ambitious Semiramis had
had such an offer, what ill use might she soon have made of it? The dancing
Damosel made no good use of the like from Herod. But a Be can suck honey out
of a flower, that a fly cannot skill to do. Esther prudently and modestly
improveth the immoderate offer of the King, and conceives good hope. How much
more may we (upon those exceeding great and precious Promises given us by God)
of an exuberancy of love, and a confluence of all comforts for this life and a
better? Especially since God does not pay his Promises with words, P^^t.
as Sertorius is said to have done; neither is he off and on with his people
(nec mutatur, nec mentitur) but performs all with the better, as Naaman
pressed the Prophets man, to take two talents, when he asked but one. The widow
of Sarepta had more then she could tell what to do with: her cruse never ceased
running till she had no room. The Shunamite would ask nothing of the Prophet,
nor make use of his offered courtesy. He sends for her again, and makes her a
free Promise of that which she most wanted and desired, a son, 2 Kings 4.16.
Gods kindness is beyond all this. he gives his servants what they forget or
presume to ask: and sends his Spirit to help them, and to form their prayers
for them, and thereby to seal them up to the day of Redemption, to assure them
of the Kingdom.

Verse 4. And Esther answered] She did not presently pour forth her whole
heart into the Kings bosom, rail against Haman, beg for her people, etc. but
prudently reserveth her self till a fitter opportunity. Unadvised
open-heartednesse is a fruit of fool-hardinesse, Prove. 29.11. A fool utters
all his mind, (ye shall have it presently, so near his mouth does it lie, that
all will out suddenly) but a wise man keeps it in till afterward, or, in an
inner r^m, (in ulteriori animi recessu as the word may be rendered, till he see
his time to produce it.

If it seem good to the King] Princes must have silken words given them, as the
mother of Artaxerxes (happily Esther) told one. The rule of old was (...), short
or sweet.

Let the King and Haman come this day to the banquet] She knew that the King
loved Hamans company, and especially at a banquet. It was policy in Rebecca to
provide such savoury meat as the old man loved: so here. Be wise as Serpents.
David is commended for his prudent, (and thereby prosperous) deporting himself
in Saul's house, 1 Samuel 18. God gave Solomon politic wisdom exceeding much. Who
is a faithful and a wise servant, Mat. 24. Jam. 3.13.
says our Savior, etc? And who is a wise man, and endued with knowledge,
(says St. James) amongst you? Let him show out of a good conversation his
works, with meekness of wisdom. But if it were policy in Esther to invite
Haman whom she hated, was it likewise Piety? did she not dissemble? R. Solomon
says, She invited Haman alone with the King, that other Courtiers might envy
him, and so undermine him. But that is but a sorry excuse, neither does Lyra's
allegation of her good intention much mend the matter. They answer better, who
say, that she invited him, that she might ane^^e him to his face: and some off
all matter of his excuse or escape. Hereby also she would show, says Lavater,
that she accursed him, not out of wrath or revenge: but that she was drawn to
it, and as it were driven by mere necessity.

Verse 5. Then the King said, Cause Haman to make haste] Heb. Accelerate or
hasten Haman, sc. to an ill bargain, as it proved the very next day. Look how
thunder commonly happens, when the sky seems most clear: so Haman saw himself
inveloped with a storm, in one of the fairest days of his fortune.
Philosophers say, that before a snow, the weather will be warmish: when the
wind lies; the great rain falls, and the air is most quiet, (...) Dic.
when suddenly there will be an earthquake.

So the King and Haman (...)] Who but the King and Haman? So Tiberius called
Sej^^, My Sej^^ Partaker of all my cares and counsels, (...) and made him his
Colleague in the Empire. But he soon cast him from supreme honor, to extreme
ignominy; so that the same Senator, who accompanied him to the Senate,
conducted him to prison, they which sacrificed unto him as to their god, which
kneeled down to him to adore him, scoffed at him, and loaded him with contempt
and concumelies. So Caesar Borgia, that restless Ambitionist, who emulating
Julius Caesar, would needs be aut Caesar, aut nullus, was shortly after and
Caesar, and nullus, being slain in the Kingdom of Navarre.

Verse 6. And the King said unto Esther at the banquet of wine] Which seems
to have been after the other banquet of dainties and sweetmeats, during which
they drank water. Only the King had aurum potabile, a golden water prepared,
(...). Athenaeus (...), Inter pocula.
which he and his eldest son alone might drink: and none else might taste of
it on pain of death. At this latter Banquet they drank wine freely one to
another: and, inter poculorum laetitiam, as Josephus has it, when his heart
was now merry within him, after he had drunk wine abundantly, as the Latin
has it, the King said unto Esther,

What is thy Petition, -- to the half of the Kingdom The Promise the King
renews, as supposing that Esther durst not propose her request, because of
the greatness of the matter: and assuring her that she should have it, though
never so great. And says not the God of heaven as much to his servants and
suppliants, Esaias 45.11. Jer. 33.3? Why then stand they off in a sinful
shamefacednesse, and improve not to the utmost this divine indulgence, this
precious privilege? why say they not with Luther, (who well understood the
latitude of this royal Charter) Fiat mea voluntas, Let my will be done: my will
I say, because the same with thine, Lord? why do they not grow upon God, and
work upon his Promise, (which is so exceeding broad, Psalm. 119, 96.) as David
did, 1 Chro. 17.23, 24, 25? he goes over it again, and yet still encroacheth,
verse 26. he presses and oppresses it, till he has expressed the sweetness
out of it, and so we have all good leave to do, Esaias 66.11. even to suck and be
satisfied by those full-strutting breasts of divine consolation. But what mean
those foul great babies the Papists, to pray the Virgin Mary to exhibit unto
them the breasts of her grace, Gab. Biel.
etc? And what frontlesse blasphemers are they to say, that God the Father has
shared his Kingdom with her: keeping his Justice to himself, and giving his
Mercy to her to dispose of? And this (say they, that they may not seem to be
mad without reason) was prefigured by Ahashnerus his saying to Esther. I will
grant thy request to the half of my Kingdom.

Verse 7. My Petition and my request is] She bespeaketh the King in his own
very words: and so must we if we mean to speed in heaven, Take unto you words,
and say, Genesis 38.25.
Take away all iniquity, and give good, etc. Produce Gods own words in prayer,
and say (as she did to Judah) Whose are these? He loves to be set upon in his
own words, to be pressed with his Promise, to be sued upon his bond. This David
knew, and therefore cries, Psalm. 86.11. Unite my heart to fear thy name: it is
as if he should say, Ezekiel. 11.19.
Thou have promised, Lord, to give me one heart; behold I find mine heart
divided, my thoughts dissipated, and my self disabled for duty, (for Anima
dispersa fit minor) Unite it, I beseech thee, etc. This is the way to make our
prayers to be nigh the Lord day and night, as Solomon phraseth it, 1 Kings.
8.59.

Verse 8. If I have found favor in the sight of the King] As she had, not so
much by her beauty and bravery (wherein Vasht perhaps might easily have
compared with her) but by the finger of God, who tameth to his Elect the
fiercest creatures (as he did the Lions to Daniel, and other savage beasts to
the Martyrs, whom they would not meddle with,) and turns the Kings heart, as
the rivers of water, into what channel soever he pleases to put it, Prove.
21.1. as the Plowman does the watercourse with his paddle, or the Gardener
with his hand.

And if it please the King] See verse 4. and submit to God, James 4.7.

And I will do to morrow as the King has said] She had learned to prefer
opportunity before time. There might be some by, at this first banquet, whose
company she liked not: or she might not yet have so clear an answer in her own
heart to her former prayers; and therefore desires some farther time that
night to seek God: whatever the reason of not putting it off till dext day was,
Gods holy hand was in it, that Mordecai might b^ first so greatly honored, and
Hamans high Gallows prepared. Illum utiquie magi^ ^eo^rum, R^ge^ autem magis
benevoli^^ magisque fecit attentu^, says Rupertus. Hereby she made Haman more
secure, and the King more kind and attent.

Verse 9. Then went Haman that day forth joyful] Saeculi laetitia est impunita
nequitia, says an Ancient, He looked upon himself now as no less favored of
the Queen, then of the King, and was puffed up with this new honor, as a
bubble is with a childs blast in a walnut-shell, with a little soap, but it
shortly after falls down again into his eyes, and vexes him.

And with a glad heart] But he rejoiced, as many more do, in a thing of naught,
Am. 6.13. And the end of this his mirth was heaviness, Prove. 14.13. It was
risus Sardonius, like that of those, who being stung with the Tarantula (a
viper in Italy) die laughing and capering. Or as the Dolphin, that sporteth
most before a storm. Or as the little fishes, that swimming merrily down the
silver stream of Jordan, fall shortly after into the dead sea. Haman doubtless
held himself now the happiest man alive. as having the royalty, not of the
Kings care only, but of the Queens too, as he foolishly fancied. Ps. 10.3, 5, 6.
This wicked on boasted of his hearts desire, and as for all his enemies, he
puffed at them. He said in his heart I shall not be moved, I shall never be in
adversity. Herodotus says of Apryes King of Egypt (Pharaoh-Hophrah Jeremy
calls him, chap^ 44.) that he conceited and bragged that his Kingdom was
better settled to him, then that any, Herod. l 2.
either God or man could remove him: yet was he afterward taken and hanged by
his own subjects. Ael. var. hist. l. 2.
Aelian tells us, that Dionysius the Tyrant, thought it impossible that he
should have been cast out of Sicily, but it proved otherwise. How suddenly were
Alex^nder the great Conqueror, and Julius Caesar the perpetual Dictator, cut
off, Ps. 118.12.
and quenched as the fire of thorns? Sic transit gloria mundi. The worlds
greatest darlings, are in no better condition, then the Bull that goes to be
sacrificed with garlands on his head, and music before him: but suddenly fells
the stroke of the murdering axe.

But when Haman saw Mordecai in the Kings gate] There he sat, and would not
stir an inch, for Hamans greatness: as resolute he remained, (not withstanding
the bloody Edict now published) as was Rawlins White the Martyr in Queen Mary's
days. The Bishop of Landaffe pretended to pray for his Conversion: after which
he said, Now Rawlins how is it with thee? Will thou revoke thine opinions or
no? Surely, (said he) my Lord, Rawlins you left me, and Rawlins you find me,
and Rawlins, by Gods grace I will continue. Act and Mon. 1415. Ibid. 1430.
The heavens shall as soon fall, said another, as I will recant. This, the mad
world styles stiffenesse, self-willednesse, fool-hardinesse, etc. as was before
noted; but the Saints do it out of Christian courage, an invincible says, and
zeal for Gods cause and Kingdom.

That he stood not up, nor moved for him] No, not he, ne minimo quidem
obsequiolo, he neither moved nor muted. For he looked upon him first as a vile
person, and therefore fit to be slighted, Pal. 15.4. Next, as an utter enemy to
God and his people, a sworn sword-man to the devil. Lastly, Mordecai herein
showed himself constant to his principles, and to his former practice, which a
good man may not easily alter, left all be questioned. Besides, should he but
have any whit yielded, Haman would have been thereby hardened, and his pride
heightened. He therefore very honestly persisteth in his purpose, and gives
that wretch less respect then ever.

He was full of indignation against Mordecai] Full, as heart could hold, of hot
wrath: so that he gloweth like a fire-coal, Et fere crepat medius. So
unsatisfiable is ambition, so restless, and so vindictive.

Verso 10. Nevertheless Haman refrained himselfe] Much ado he had to forbear
mischieving him: he was feign to force himself thereunto, as the word
signifies; for his fingers even itched to be having him by the ears, or to be
bathing in his blood. This he did not, happily because he durst not; because
Mordecai was the Kings servant, his Doorkeeper, as it is thought, and so went
under his protection. It would therefore have reflected upon the King himself,
if he should lay violent hands on him. Most sure it is, that God held his
hands, and preserved Mordecai for further good to his Church Precious in the
sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints: neither will he send them to bed,
till they have done their work.

And when he came home, he sent and called for his friends] This had been a
wise man's part, if he had done it for any good purpose. But as he was in an ill
case to consult, as being full of rage, so he minded nothing but revenge, and
therefore advised with none but such as would say with him, and thereby hasten
his downfall.

And zeresh his wife] Vt consiliariorum primam and praecipuam. That she was
wife above her sex. See chap. 6.13. But had she been as wife as Pilates wife
was. She would not have given here such pestilent counsel, but have warned her
husband of meddling with just men. Have these workers of iniquity no knowledge,
that they eat up Gods people, as they eat bread? that they make account to
make but a breakfast of them? Psalm. 14.4.


Verse. 11. And Haman told them of the glory of his riches] Favorites
(observing their mollissima fandi tempora,) get many times much wealth under
Princes: as did Sejanus under Tiberius, Seneca under Nero, that rich and
wretched Cardinal Henry Beauford, Bishop of Winchester, and Chancellor of
England, in the reign of Henry the sixth, Cardinal Woolsey, under Henry the
eight. That Haman had well-feathered his nest, appears by his large offer to
the King of ten thousand talents of silver, etc. Now riches render a man
glorious in the worlds eye; hence they go coupled together. Prove. 3.16. and
8.18. Hence that of Labans grumbling sons, Genesis 31.1. Quicquid non acquiritur
damnum est. Sen.
Jacob has taken away all that was our fathers, (nay, not all, but as avarice
made Sejanus think all which he acquired not, to be lost; so did these losels)
and of that which was of our fathers has be gotten all this glory. But what
were all this glory of his riches, if, for want of children, Haman should leave
it to those, Quos vel nescit, vel nolit, as Austin has it, De C D. l. 5. c. 18.
to strangers or enemies? He tells them therefore

Of the multitude of his children] His sons and his successors like to be. I
say, likely to be, not sure to be, for Omnia sunt hominum tenui pendentia filo.
God gave Leda, Luctuosam foecunditatem, as Hierom says of her, Epist 7.
a sorrowful fruitfulness, because she lived to bury her many children. There
were two and twenty children, and childrens children of the House of Portugal,
betwixt Philip the second of Spain, and that Crown; and yet he outlived them
all, as Histories show, Balthas Exuer.
and his successors held that Kingdom till within these sew years. It is but
a vain thing therefore for a man to boast of the multitude of children, since he
may either lose them, Utinam aut coeiebs vixissem, aut orbus per^issem.
or live to wish as Augustus the Emperor did, Oh that I had either lived a
Batchelour, or died childelesse!

And all the things wherein the King had promoted him] Wherein, but Wherefore,
he shows not. Dignity should wait upon desert; but many times we see it
otherwise, and it was of old complained of, Psalm. 12. ult. He tells what the
King had done for him, but not a tittle what God. God was not in all his
thoughts. He might justly have been twitted, as once that Pope was pithily,
when he had engraven upon the gates of his new-built College. Vtrecht (where
he was borne) planted me; Lovain (where he was bred) watered me; but Caesar (who
had promoted him to the Popedom) gave increase: a merry Passenger under-wrote
Hic Deus nihil fecit, here God did nothing. God had done much for him, but for
a mischief to him; as he once gave the Israelites quails to choke them, and a
King to vex them; as Saul gave Michal to David to be a mare to him; and as our
Savior gave Judas the bag, to discover the rottenness of his heart. This
Bernard calls, Misericordiam omni indignatione crudeliorem. God gives outward
blessings to wicked persons to furnish their enditement out of them: as Joseph
put a cup into his brethrens sack, to pick a quarrel with them, and lay theft
to their charge.

And how he had advanced him above the Princes] What an impudent Thraso was
this Haman? this odious bragging of his, Gregory refers to that third kind
of pride, Lib. 25. Marol.
such as Gods soul abhors, and surely punishes; as he did in the Prince of
Tire, Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus, Herod, whose hearts were listed up with their
estates, as a boat, that rises with the rising of the water, whose bloods and
goods rose together.

Cord stat inflato, pauper honor duto. But as the Peacock so delights to be
seen, and to behold his own tail, that he discovers his filthy parts
behind, so do vain glorious Bragadochio's. It is therefore very good counsel,
that a grave Divine gives to such, as are advanced above others. Carry humble
hearts, and add grace and virtue to your places, else they shall prove but as
an high gibbet to bring you to more disgrace in this world, and torment in the
next. Whatcleys Archetype.
That of the Poet also is very savoury and sovereign.

Desinat elat is quisquam confidere rebus:
Magna repent ruunt, Claudian.
summa cadunt subito.
Verse 12. Haman said moreover] He makes no end of vaunting and vapouring; and
all to aggravate the indignity done him by Mordecai, in not stooping to so
great a personage.

Now Esther the Queen did let no man come in, -- but my selfe] This he
mistaketh for a special favor, when as Esthers banquet proved no better to
him, then Semiramis her tomb did to them that rifled it; they expected to find
treasure, but met with a deadly poison.

And to morrow am I invited, etc.] Where thou shall (as hypocrites do at the
Lords Table) eat thy bane, and drink thy poison; yet art thou over-joyed as if
highly favored. A temporary may receive both the word audible and the word
visible, (the Sacrament) with much seeming joy: which yet is but only as the
commotion of the affections in a dream: It fares with such in the end, as with
one that sleeping on the top of a steep rock, dreameth of great matters
befallen him, but starting suddenly through joy thereof, tumbleth headlong into
the sea, and breaks his neck at the bottom.

Verse 13. Yet all this avails me nothing] It is seldom seen, (says a Right
Reverend Interpreter here) that God allows unto the greatest darlings of the
world a perfect contentment. Something they must have to complain of, that
shall give an unsavory verdure to their sweetest morsels, and make their
felicity miserable. Totum hoc non est utile mihi, I enjoy nothing of all this.
No more did Ahah, when sick of Naboths vineyard, 1 Kings 21.4. His heart did
more afflict and vex it self with greedy longing for that bit of earth, then
the vast and spacious compass of a Kingdom could counter-comfort.

So long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the Kings gate] So tormentful is
envy, if it cannot come at another man's hurt, it will feed upon its own. Who
would ever set by the profits, pleasures and preferments of this present life,
that yield so little sound and sincere contentment to those that have most of
them? In the very pursuit of them is much anguish, many grievances, fears,
jealousies, disgraces, interruptions, etc. and after the unsanctified enjoyment
of them (if any such thing there be, for even in laughter the heart is
sorrowful, Prove. 14.13. and there is a snare, (or a cord) in the sin of the
wicked, Prove. 29.6. to strangle their joy with) follows the sting of
conscience, that will inexpressibly torment the soul throughout all eternity:
besides the vexation of it, to see such as Mordecai the Jew, whom they once
would not have set with the dogs of their flocks, sitting not at the Kings
gate, but on Christ's own Throne, Rev. 3.21. as Partakers of all his glory.

Verse 14. Then said Zeresh his wife] Thra^o's shall never want for Gnatho's.
Such as have first flattered themselves, shall have enough others to sooth them,
and to say with them. Zeresh sets the motion of revenge on foot, she was a fit
helve for such an hatcher, wittily wicked. The wit of women has wont to be
noted, for more sudden and more shrewd.

And all his friends unto him] Indeed no friends, because flatterers and
furtherers in evil. Sed divitibus ideo amicus deest, quia nihil deest. The rich
has many friends, says Solomon, seeming friends, but true enemies, parasites,
brokers, cole-carriers. good to scour an hot Oven withal. Such a one was that
Adullamite to Judah, Genesis 38.20. Jonadab to Amnon, 2 Samuel 13.2, 3. those
green-headed counselors to Rehoboam, etc. Haman should have made a better
choice, and have come more calm to counsel. It is not good sowing in a
tempest, nor taking physic in a fit. These friends of Haman deserved to speed
as ill as those of Sejanus did, who were executed with him, because they served
his lust, and added ^ewel to his flame.

Let a Gallows be made of fifty cubits high] A cubit was half a yard at
least. In those parts they had trees very tall, or they might piece one to
another. But why so high a Gallows, Daniels hist. fol. 19.
but for the greater disgrace to Mordecai, and terror to all that should
slight the Kings Favorite? So Knute. the first Danique King of England, caused
the false Edricks head to be set upon the highest part of the Tower of London.
And our Gunpowder Traitors were served in like manner. Daniels hist. f. 19.


And to morrow] But why so soon, since in case of life, Nulla cunctatio satis
diuturna esse possit? were it not fit that he were tried first? Hamans malice
will bear no delays, he is in pain till the business be dispatched: he cannot
sleep till he have caused this innocent man to fall, Prove. 4.16. though he fall
with him; as the dragon does with the Elephant, whose blood he sucketh out, and
perishes by his falling weight. Plin l. 8 c 12


Speak thou unto the King] It will be but dictum, factum, he will lightly say
as Zedekiah did to his Princes, requiring Jeremiah to the stocks. The King is
not he that can deny you any thing. How much better that Roman Emperor, who
being to subscribe a warrant for execution of a certain Malefactor, cried out,
Non nisi coactus, full sore against my will? and another, Vtinam literas
nescirem, I would I could not write my name. So when one Jone Butcher was to be
burned for her deserts, all the Council could not prevail with our Edward the
sixth, of a long time to set to his hand. Act and Mon 1177.
But these wicked friends of Haman, question not the Kings readiness to
gratify him, though they could not but know, that Mordecai had once at least
saved the Kings life, chap. 2. and what could they tell, but the King might now
remember it? Sed Deus quem destruit dementat, when God has a mind to undo a
man, he first infatuateth him.

That Mordecai may be hanged thereon] And that before Haman; door, that he may
feed his eyes on that sweet spectacle, and say as that bloody Prince Charles
the ninth of France did, when he saw the noble Admirals carcass hanging and
stinking upon the Gallows, Quam suaviter olet cadaver inimici! Ep. hist Gall.
150.151.
How sweetly smells the dead body of an enemy!

Then go thou in merrily with the King, etc.] They knew that he could not be
heartily merry till then, and forced smiles are but as counterfeit complexion,
the hypocrisy of mirth. So Richard the third would not sit down to dinner till
the Lord Hastings were beheaded: nor Stephen Gardener, till he had the news
brought him that the Bishops were burnt at Oxford. Oh that we could be as
restless, Act and Mon. f. 16^2.
till the hindrances of our true spiritual joy were removed; I mean those
stubborn corruptions that will not stoop to the power of grace.

And the thing pleased Haman] As being agreeable to his malicious humor, and
that which he doubted not to be able to effect. Man purposes, but God
disposes.

And he caused the Gallows to be made] Little thought he for whom. Aequnm est
ut faber quas fecit compedes ipse gestet. So let thine enemies perish, O Lord.

CHAP. VI. Verse 1. On that night]
THat very night before Mordecai should have been hanged on the morrow morning,
and so early that Esther could not have begged his life, would she never so
feign. God will appear for his poor people. (...), in the nick and opportunity
of time, 1 Pet. 5.6. He will be seen in the Mount, he will come as out of an
Engine.

Could not the King sleep] Heb. the Kings sleep fled away, and, like a shadow,
it fled away so much the faster, as it was more followed. Sleep is best
solicited by neglect, and soonest found, when we have forgotten to seek it.
They are likeliest for it, who together with their clothes can put off their
cares: and say as Lord Burleigh did when he threw off his gown, Lie there Lord
Treasurer. This, great Ahashuerus cannot do at present, (for Crowns also have
their cares, thistles in their arms, and thorns in their sides) Lo, he that
commanded one hundred and twenty seven Provinces cannot command an hours sleep;
how should he when as sleep is Gods gift, Psalm. 127.2? And it was he that at
this time kept him awake for excellent ends; and put small thoughts into his
heart for great purpose, like as he did into our Henry the eighth, when the
Bishop of Baion (the French Ambassador) coming to consult with him about a
marriage between the Lady Mary and the Duke of Orleans, Life and dea^ of Card.
Wo^ sey, 65.
cast a scruple into his mind, which rendered him restless. Whether Mary were
legitimate, etc. If it were his surfeiting and drunkenness the day before that
hindered Ahashuerus from sleeping, ^^lin.
(habent enim hoc ebrii, ut neque dormiant, neque vigilent) Gods goodness
appears the more, in turning his sin to the good of the Church. Venenum
aliquando pro remedio fuit, says Seneca, He can make of a poisonful viper an
wholesome treacle: and by an Almighty Alchymy draw good out of evil.

And he commanded to bring the book of records] Perhaps some special Notes or
Commentaries, (...).
written for the Kings own use; as M. Aurelius had his (...). Julius Caesar had
his Commentaries written with his own hand, and for the help of his own memory.
Turk. hist.
Tamerlane had the like book, wherein he read a great part of the night, before
the mortal battle between him and Bajazet.

Of the Chronicles] Perhaps, besides the former book of remembrances, or else
the same; Librum Commentariorum, Chronica, as Tremelius renders it, the book
of Commentaries, even the Chronicles; but the Vulgar and Tygurine make them
several books.

And they were read before the King] Perhaps as a Recipe, to bring on sleep, or
at least to deceive the time; and yet it may he too for a better purpose, viz.
to better his knowledge, and to rub up his memory, that dignity might wait upon
desert: as it did in Tamerlanes time, who kept a catalogue of their names who
had best deserved of him, Turk hist. 227.
which he daily perused, oftentimes saying, that day to be lost, wherein he had
not done something for them. This Ahashuerus had not yet done for Mordecai, who
therefore happily held with the Poet. Omnia sunt ingrata nihil fecisse benign
est. But God was not unrighteous to forget his work and labor of love, Heb.
6.10. though men were unthankful. ^et us gratia ^ormite. Pind. ^er rar o grati
^periuntur. Cic.


Verse 2. And is was found written] It was God who directed the Reader to that
very place: like as he did the Eunuch to Esaias 53.7, 8. where reading of the
meekness of Jesus Christ, he was transformed into the same image; as was
likewise Johannes Isaac a Jew, converted by reading the same chapter. Hoc ego
ingenue profiteor, says he, Caput illud ad fidem Christi me adduxisse. This I
confess ingenuously, that lighting upon that chapter, I was brought thereby to
the faith of Christ. Austin thought he heard a voice, saying, Toll, lege, take
up the Bible and read: accordingly he took it up, and opening it, fell upon
that text in the Romans, chap. 13.14. which was the main means of his
Conversion.

That Mordecai had told of Bigthana, etc.] See chap. 2.21.

Verse 3. And the King said, What honor and dignity has been done to Mordecai
for this?] Lyra says that he had waited six years for a reward, and had none.
In Princes Courts men are sure to meet with two evils, (...) and (...), not so
in heaven. The Butler forgate Joseph. Solomon speaks of a poor wise man, who
by his wisdom delivered the City, yet no man remembered that same poor man,
Eccl. 9.15. This is merces mundi, the worlds wages. Mordecai had saved the
Kings life, and yet is unrewarded. The Kings of Persia used to be very
bountiful to those that had well deserved of them, ^erod. l. 8.
or of the Commonwealth: calling such Orosangae, and setting down both their
names and their acts in the Chronicles, as Herodotus testifies. Among the rest
he mentions one Phylacus, Qui inter been de rege meritos ascriptus est, and
multo tractu soli donatus, ^erod l. 3.
who was put upon record for his good service to the King, and rewarded with a
great deal of land given him. Others had great store of gold and silver, and a
gallant house, as Democedes Crotoniates the Physician, who cured Darius, had at
Susis. It is well known out of Xenophon, what rich gifts Cyrus gave to his
friends and followers, chains of gold, ^ib 8 Cyro^ed.
armelets, bridles bossed with gold, Persian Stoles, called Dorophoricae, etc.
Herodotus tells us, that this Ahashuerus (alias Xerxes) gave Megabyzus for
his good service at Babylon, a golden Mill weighing six talents. Plutarch
writes, that he gave Themistocles above two hundred talents, and three Cities
besides, ( viz. Magnesia, Lampsacus and M^untis) to find him food, ^lut. in
Themist.
and for clothing and furniture two more, viz. Percos and Palaescepsis. How
came it then to pass that good Mordecai was so forgotten? Surely it was a
great fault in this ungrateful King, but Gods holy hand was in it, that
Mordecai should not have no present recompense, but that it should be deferred
till a fitter opportunity, when God might be more glorified in the preservation
of his people, and destruction of their enemies. Let us not therefore be weary
of well-doing: for (however men deal by us) we shall be sure to reap in due
season if we faint not, Gal. 6.9. God best sees when a mercy will be most
sweet and seasonable. When his people are low enough, and the enemy high
enough, then usually it appears, that there is a God that judges in the
earth, and a rich reward for the righteous. Men may neither remunerate nor
remember the good turns we have done them: but there is a book of remembrance
written before the Lord for all them that fear him, and that think upon his
name, Mal. 3.16. See my Treatise on that text, called, The Righteous man's
Recompense, annexed to my Comment upon the Small Ptophets.

Then said the Kings servants] The Eunuchs or Gentlemen of the bedchamber:
ingenuous men they were, and not disaffected to Mordecai, whom yet they could
not but know to be a great eyesore to Prince Haman. Si juvenes isti vulgari
invident^^ morbo laborassent, says Lavater. If these young men had been sick
of that common disease of envy, they would have extenuated his good service,
and have said, Mordecai is a despised Jew, a stranger, a captive. If he
revealed the conspiracy, he did but his duty, and provided thereby well for his
own safety. Is it not reward enough that he lives, and at Court, where he has
a place, an office, etc? Courtiers, we know, love not to have others come over
their heads, but think all lost which themselves acquire not, Q^icquid no^
acquititur dan^ number est. (...): Xen. Cyrop. l. 8. Ep. Praes. Enarr. in Hos.
as Seneca says Sejanus did. We know how it was in the Courts of Pharaoh,
Saul, Herod. That Is a rare commendation that is given by Xenephon of Cyrus his
Courtiers, that though a man should seek or choose blindfold, he could not
miss of a good man. David's Court might very well be such, Psalm. 101. and Queen
Elizabeth's, and George Prince of Anhalts, of whom Melancthon writes, that his
chamber was Ecclesia, Academia, Curia, a Church, an University, and a Court,
Palaestra pietatis and literarum, as Tremelius says of Cranmers family, a
School of Piety and Learning.

There is nothing done for him] And yet the Apocryphal Additions, chap. 12.
ver. 5.6. say otherwise.

Verse 4. And the King said, Who is in the Court] Josephus says, that he first
asked, What a clock it was, and understanding that it was morn-light, (for so
long he had heard his servants read, and till then it was not that Mordecai's
matter was mentioned, Haman being now ready to get a warrant for his execution)
he asked, Who Is there without? as desirous to proceed by counsel in a business
of that consequence.

Now Haman was come, etc.] He was early up, (and at Court for a mischief) but
never the nearer, save only to his own utter ruin.

To speak to the King to hang Mordecai] Which till it were done, he could
neither sleep in quiet, nor eat with comfort. Little considered he how the
Gallows groaned for himself. The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and
the wicked comes in his stead, Prove. 11.8.

Vivit adhuc Christus, regnat, regnabit and usque:
Atque hosts omnes sub ditione premit.
Verse 5. Behold Haman stands in the Court] For into the Presence he might
not come uncalled. And to be thus called in he held it no small happiness; but
was soon confuted. He came into the room (as men come to a Lottery) with his
head full of hopes, but he went thence with his heart full of blanks.

And the King said, let him come in] See here, says Merlin, a sweet and
special Providence of God in this, that Ahashuerus should take advice about
honoring Mordecai, and not of his servants that attended upon his person, but
of Haman then present, (though for another purpose) and, concealing the man he
meant, should make Haman say what was fit to be done, and then do it
accordingly. Neither the King nor his servants likely, would ever have thought
of doing Mordecai so great honor as Haman prescribed. See here, as in a
mirror, how the Lord by a secret Providence brings about, and over-ruleth
the wiles of men, their affairs, times, counsels, words and speeches, to the
fulfilling of his own Will and Decree; and this, when they think least of doing
Gods Will, or serving his Providence.

Verse 6 So Haman came in] Merry and jocund, but went out sad and
heavy-hearted. These hoasts (profit, pleasure and preferment) though they
welcome us into our Inn with smiling countenances, yet if we watch them not,
they will cut our throats in our beds. It is observed of Edward the third, that
he had always fair weather at his passage into France, ^peed. Walsingham.
and foul upon his return. Pharaoh had fair weather till he was in the heart
of the red sea. The Sun shone-faire upon the earth that morning that Lot came
out of Sodom, but ere night there was a dismal change. He that lives in the
height of the worlds blandishments, is not far from destruction.

And the King said unto him, What shall be done, etc.] Though the King knew of
no difference betwixt Haman and Mordecai (says a grave Interpreter) yet he
suppresseth Mordecai's name: and thus the Lord by his Providence brought it
about, that even Haman himself should, Mr. Jackson.
to his greater vexation, appoint the honors that should be done to Mordecai,
and that at a time when he was come to desire of the King that he might be
hanged, and with full assurance that he should have obtained his desire.

Now Haman thought in his heart] Heb. said in his heart; the language whereof
God very well understood: and here utters, to the perpetual shame of this
monstrous Ambitionist.

To whom would the King delight to do honor more then to my self?] Ambition
(as they say of the Crocodile) grows as long as it lives; and self-love,
like to a good stomach, draws to it self what nourishment it likes, and casts
off that which offends it. It makes men unreasonable, and teaches them to
turn the glass to see themselves bigger, Herod. l. 8.
others lesser then they are. Herodotus reports, that after the Greeks had
got the better of this Xerxes and his Persians, and came together to divide the
spoil, when it was put to the question, who of all the Commanders had deserved
the best and chief reward? none would yield to other, but every man thought
himself best deserving, and second to none. Aen. Sylv.
In the battle at Belgrade, where Mahomet the great Turk was beaten and driven
out of the field, Capistranus and Hunniades were the Chieftaines there. And
whereas both of them wrote the relation of that days work, neither of them so
much as once mentioned the other, (though both of them had done their parts
gallantly,) but each one took the whole praise of it to himself. Haman, though
altogether unworthy of the least respect, yet holds himself best worthy of the
greatest honors, and therefore will be sure to be no niggard in advising those
ceremonies of honor, which he presumes meant to his own person.

Verse 7. And Haman answered the King] After a short pause, he had his answer
ready; but making a bridge of his own shadow, he soon fell into the brook.
Ambition rides without reins, and like those horses, Amos 6.11. runs upon
the rocks, where first she breaks her hoofes, and then her neck. It seems by
that which follows, that Haman aspired to the Kingdom: why else did he ask
the Crown-royal, and the Kings horse, etc? When David would declare Solomon his
successor in the Kingdom, he set him upon his own mule, 1 Kings 1.33. But
Haman little thought that those his high hopes should end in a rope. So did
Hanno's the Carthaginian, and Roger Mortimers in King Edward the second his
time, and the false Edrick in King Knute's days: and lastly Hadrian de
Cast^llo, an Italian Legate, made by King Henry the seventh, Bishop of
Hereford, who conspired with Alphonso Petruccio, and other sacred Cardinals, to
murder Pope Leo the tenth, induced thereunto by the suggestion of a witch, who
foretold him, that one Hadrian an old man, of mean Parentage, of great learning
and wisdom, should succeed in the Papacy; Paul. Jovius.
the man ( Haman-like) thought it must needs be himself: but another Hadrian
Schoolmaster to Charles the fifth proved to be the man: and this our Hadrian
lost by deprivation all his promotions whatsoever, (for his life could not be
come at) for his nefarious attempt.

For the man whom the King delights to honour] Heb. In whose honor the King
delights. And what will not delight do whether in good or evil? See the Note
on Micah 7.18.

Verse 8. Let the royal apparel be brought, etc.] This was very glorious and
gorgeous; Xenoph. l. 8 Plut l. 11. defort Alex. Luc de navig. Dion. ^rat. de
(...) and lib Curt l. 3. and 6.
as is to be seen in Xenophon, Plutarch, Lucian, Dion, Chrysostom, and other
good Authors. The Persian Kings wore on their heads an upright Tiare or
Turbant very sumptuous; a Diadem also made of white and purple color. On
their bodies a rich purple Stole, or robe of State, reac^^ down to the heels:
this Curtius calls pallam Persicam, a Persian Pall, beset with gold and
precious stones, great store, and the pictures of wild creatures and souls of
the air. Curtius describing Xerxes his royal apparel, says, that golden
hawks encountering one another with their beakes adorned his robe made of cloth
of gold. Besides, they wore a rich Cassock (called Candy) bound to them with a
golden girdle, breeches also of scarlet, reaching to their knees; Ep. ad Fabi^
called therefore by the Greeks, (...), as Hierome testifies.

And the horse that the King rides upon] The King of Persia did always ride,
either on horseback, or in a charet, and had one special horse proper to
himself, as had also David, 1 Kings 1.33. Alexander, Julius Caesar, etc. At
this day the better sort in Persia fight, buy, sell, confer, and do all on
horseback. Cort^^r. trav^ 63.
The difference between the Gentleman and the Peasant is, that the Peasant
never rides, the Gentleman never goes on foot.

And the Crown-royal that is set upon his head] This was monstrous ambition:
appoint him the Kingdom also, might Ahashuerus have said. Lyra notes here,
that Haman aspired to the Kingdom, because none but the King could have the
Crown-royal set upon his head: wherefore the King also in answering to the
things propounded by him, says, Take the robe and the horse as thou have said,
but of the Crown he makes no mention. Some of the Hebrews by head here
understand the horses head; Nam apud Persas solebat equus defer diadema
regni, the Kings horse was wont to carry the royal Crown. Vatablus thinks this
sense not unlikely, because the Crown is not mentioned, verse 11. and this
might also peradventure be the custom and fashion of Persia, says Diodate.
Merlin notes here, that Haman makes no mention of rewards or gifts to be
conferred upon him, because he had wealth enough already, and desired only more
honors, instancing the utmost that could be done to any subject, in seeking
whereof he miserably failed.

Verse 9. And let this apparel and horse be delivered, etc.] All must be done
in amplest manner: and if it had been done to himself as he desired, Forte
ampli^ ^uisset, nisi v^ ri^as esset re^ suspicione n^ tiquam care^ Lavat.
what had all that been but a magnum nihil, as one says, a great nothing, a
glorious fancy, a rattle to still his ambition for a while? He, simple man,
had wrought himself into the fools paradise of a sublime dotage, like as the
Spaniards have in their dream of a Catholic Monarchy, divinitus debita, says
one, sed in Vtopia. They were laughed at a good by Captain Drake, and his
company, when they took Sancta Domingo. Anno 1585. and in the Town Hall found
the King of Spaines arms, and under them a Globe of the world, out of which
arose a horse with his fore-feet cast forth with this Inscription, Non sufficit
orbis. Pyrrhus, that ambitious King of Epirotes, had the like thought; but was
slain at last with a tilestone thrown upon his head by a woman. And a like evil
end befell Caesar Borgia, who in imitation of Julius Caesar, would needs be, aut
Caesar, aut nullus, and soon after proved to be Et Caesar, and nullus. Had
Haman but contented himself with his present condition (too good for such a
Caitiffe) he might have lived in the worlds account happily, and have called
himself as that French King did Tresheureuse, thrice blessed, but that
insatiable thirst after honor, that gluttonous excessive desire after more and
more greatness undid him. So true is that Proverb of the Ancients, Turdus ipse
sibi malum cacat, Of the black birds dung is made the lime wherewith he is
taken, so out of the dung of men's sins does God make his lime-twigs of
judgment to take them withal.

To one of the Kings most noble Princes] Principibus majoribus paratimis. This
would be no small addition to the honor of the man, and splendor of the day,
like as it was here in England, when Henry the second, at the Coronation of his
eldest son, renounced the name of a King for that day, and, as Sewer, served
at the Table.

That they may array the man withal] Setting him forth to the greatest
advantage: as our Henry the sixth did, when he crowned the Lord Beauch^mp King
of the Isle of Wight, and as Xerxes did Demaratus, Sen. l. 6. de^
when for honors sake he granted him to enter into Sardis, the chief City of
Asia, arrayed like himself, with a straight Tiare upon his head, which none
might wear but Kings only.

Through the street of the City] Of Susa, that he might be seen and cried up by
mamy, for Honor est in honorante. As the Meteor lives in the air, so does
honor in the breath of other men. Plato reckons it among those dei ludibria
quae sursum ac deorsum sub coelo feruntur, like tennis-balls bandied up and
down from one to another.

Verse 10. Then the King said to Haman] The King had no intent herein to
ensnare Haman, or cross his humor, but God had a hand in it for the effecting
of his own ends, which cannot but be ever exceeding good, since his will is not
only recta but regula.

Make haste, and take the aparel, and the horse, etc.] Here was no time left
him of deliberation, or liberty of contradiction, dispute he must not, but
dispatch what was given him in charge. Had he had but the least
breathing-while, that stepping out of the presence he might have considered
with himself, or consulted with his friends, he would either have fained
himself sick, or found some other excuse, that he might not have done his enemy
this honor. But God had so ordered it, and the King commanded it to be done
forthwith; it was not therefore for Haman, vel responsare, velrepugnare, to
chat or chafe, unless he would run the hazard of all; for, Where the word of a
King is, there is power; and who may say unto him, What do thou?

And do even so to Mordecai the Jew] This word stabbed Haman to the heart, who
had run many great hazards doubtless to dominere in his undeserved dignities;
and now must perforce honor him whom he had hoped to have hanged; cloth him
whom he hoped to have stripped; help him up to his horse, upon whose grave he
hoped to have danced; prepare a triumph for him, for whom he had prepared a
tree; make Proclamation before him as a Crier lead his horse as a Lacquey, do
all offices for him as a slave or underling: Oh what a cut, what a Cordolium
was this to a man of his metal and making! It was wonder his heart burst not,
as did Achitophels, for pride so swells the soul many times, that it breaks
the case, the body I mean, and ends the life: but this had been here to have
saved the Hangman a labor. But base spirits will buckle, and fall down to
rise, crouch and creep to mount, etc.

That sits at the Kings gate] There you shall have him, and see that you
mistake him not. Haman knew him well enough by his stiffenesse and stoutnesse,
and wished him of all the men in the world out of the world.

Let nothing fail of all that thou have spoken] Perquam hoc durum est, sed ita
lex scripta est, says the Civil Lawyer, this was an hard saying, and as hard
meat to Hamans stomach that would ill go down, but there was no help for it,
himself had advised it, and must therefore speedily execute it. Lata
negligentia dolus est, says the Lawyer: remisseness is a kind of
perfidiousnesse. Excuses would have been construed for refusals, delays for
denials, etc.

Verse 11. Then took Haman the aparel, etc.] Full sore against stomach be sure,
But how could he help it? Thus God compels the devil and his limbs
sometimes, though against their wills, to serve him and his servants, Canes
lingunt ulcera Lazari: Saul pronounces David more righteous then he; Judas and
Pilate give testimony to Christ's innocence. These are the servants of the High
God, which show unto us the way of salvation, said the Pythonisse concerning
Paul and his companions, Acts 16.17.

And arrayed Mordecai] Whose heart he could rather have torn out, and eaten it
with salt. But Courtiers are usually notable Dissemblers, cunning Politicians,
etc. How busy is Haman now about Mordecai to array him, to mount him, and to
attend upon him, whom yet he hated and inwardly cursed to the pit of hell?
Cavete ab osculo Iscariotico, ab officio Hamanitico. Beware of men, Matthew. 10.
Josephus tells us, that when Haman came to do these things to Mordecai, he
(thinking that he had mocked him) answered with indignation, Thou most wicked
man, do thou thus insult over the miserable. But when he had told him, that
indeed it was the Kings pleasure, he suffered him to do it. But what shall we
say to reconcile those cross passions in Ahashucrus? Before he signed that
decree of killing all the Jews, he could not but know that a Jew had saved his
life: and now after that he had enacted the slaughter of all the Jews as
rebels, (...). Hall.
he gives order to honor a Jew as his Preserver. It were strange (says a
right Reverend Writer hereupon) if great persons in the multitude of their
distractions, should not let fall some incongruities.

And brought him on horseback] Whom before he could not endure to see sitting
at the Court-gate. A great trouble it was to Haman to lead Mordecai's horse,
which another man would not have thought so, the moving of a straw troubles
proud flesh, etc.

Thorough the streets of the City] Where all men were now in an amazement at
that sudden glory of Mordecai, and study how to reconcile this day with the
thirteenth of Adar.

And proclaimed before him] Not without an honorable mention made of his
loyalty and fidelity to the King, the cause of that great honor. This Haman
was forced to proclaim, and that on foot as a servant: when Mordecai as a
Prince in his state was on horseback. It is probable, that Haman thought within
himself, that he should shortly have his penniworths of that vile varlet, whom
now he thus far honored, and that happily ere night yet, at the feast, he might
prevail with the King to do by Mordecai, as once he did by his Steersman, when
he came back with shame and loss from his wars with Greece. He was forced,
says the History, to fly back in a poor Fishers boat: which being
over-burdened had sunk all, if the Persians by casting away themselves had not
saved the life of their King: the loss of which noble spirits so vexed him,
that having given the Steersman a golden Coronet for preserving his own life,
he commanded him to execution as a Co-Authour of the death of his servants.

Verse 12. And Mordecai came again to the Kings gate] No whit over-joyed of his
new honor, or puffed up thereby (as many would have been, a small wind
blows up a bubble) only he conceives hope thereby of a better condition, and
takes every former mercy for a pledge of a future: this experience breeds
confidence. He does not rush into the Court at his return, and reach after an
higher room, but came again to the Kings gate, where his office was, and his
business lay: he took up also, as some think, his old habit again: (the Kings
apparel and horse being restored to the right owner, he had as little delight
in it, as David once had of Saul's armor;) but it is rather probable, says an
Expositour, that he now left that off, being full of hope, that as God had
heard his prayers, to bring him out of danger, and to high honor: so he should
now, be able to help his brethren the Jews out of theirs also. Meanwhile he
does not envy his superiors, insult over his inferiors, trouble his equals,
threaten his enemies, etc. but commits himself and all his affairs to Gods
good pleasure and Providence and this is the guise of a godly man, Psalm. 131.1,
2.

But Haman hasted to his house mourning] Or, vexed at heart, fretting within
himself, that he was so very much disappointed. Merrily he made account to
have gone to the Queens feast, when he had first trussed up Mordecai. Of which
not only missing, but made to do him public honor in that sort, and that by
his own direction, this galled him and grieved him above measure; so
bladder-like is the foul of an unregenerate man, that filled with earthly
vanities, though but wind, it grows great, and swells in pride: but if
pricked with the least pin of piercing grief, it shriveleth to nothing.

And having his head covered] With his cap pulled over his eyes, as ashamed to
look any one in the face. See, 2 Samuel 15.30. Jer. 14.4.

Verse 13. And Haman told Zeresh his wife, and all his friends] Expecting
comfort and counsel from them, but they read him his destiny, and add to his
grief and desparation: letting him know, that his state was such, as that there
was neither hope of better, nor place of worse: a just hand of God upon such an
hard-hearted wretch, that had plotted the ruin of so many innocents. And this
his wife and friends, had they done well, should have minded him of, and
stirred him up to repent of his wickedness against God, the cause of his
present wretchedness, to be reconciled to Mordecai, whom he and they plainly
saw to be Gods Favorite, and now the Kings also) to take down that ugly
Gallows, (that there were no further notice taken of it) the evidence and
ensign of his insufferable pride, and their unsavory counsel, to get the
decree for the Jews Massacre reversed or countermanded, etc. But not a word
find we of any thing this way tending. Graceless people neither have God in
their heads, Psalm. 10.4. nor hearts, Psalm. 14.1. nor words, Psalm. 12.4. nor
ways, Tit. 1.16. but stand in a posture of distance, nay defiance: walking
contrary to him, and therefore he also to cry quittance, walks contrary to
them, Lev. 26. showing himself as froward as they for the hearts of them, Psalm.
18.26.

Every thing that had befallen him] The sad accidents of that day, nothing now
(as once, chap. 5.11.) boasts he to them of the glory of his riches, and
multitude of his children, and how the King had advanced him above all his
other Courtiers. Hamans ^rowing was now turned into crying, etc.

Then said his wife men] Wizards happily, such as he made use of when he cast Pur
for a luckie day, and into whose mouths the devil might put this answer. It is
his use to bring his impes into the briars, and there to leave them, as he did
Saul, (whose Funeral Sermon he preached, and Judas, Julian, Valens and others.

And Zeresh his wife said unto him] She is noted for a prudent woman; but here
she proves as cold a comforter, as before she had been an evil counselor.

If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jewes] A Nation noted for dear to God, often
delivered by him, and that had also the faculty of gaining the good will of
Princes, by their excellent virtues, as it had been seen in Daniel and his
companions, in Jechoniah, Zerubbabel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and the whole Nation, so
graciously licensed by Cyrus to return into their own Country. It is a good
Note that one gives here, A Jew may fall before a Persian, and get up and
prevail: but if a Persian, or whosoever of the Gentiles begin to fall before a
Jew, he can neither stay nor rise, etc.

Thou shall not prevail against him] But why did they not tell him this
before, since they knew as well as Haman, that Mordecai was of the seed of the
Jews, and therefore advised him to prepare such a huge Gallows? Surely, he
that had so flattered himself, deserved to be so flattered and undone by
others: he that had given so evil counsel to the King against the Jews,
deserved by such evil counselors to be cast into straits, and have no hand to
help him out; they lead him to his bane, and there leave him: as familiars do
their witches, when they have once brought them into fetters.

But shall surely fall before him] Thus is Haman judged of all, condemned by
all, and this with so great assurance of such an event, as if they had seen it.
Vtique coram eo concides. Thou shall surely fall before him, and that
irrecoverably: as Eli fell, and as those idolaters are threatened, Amos 8.14.
The Hebrew is, falling thou shall fall, viz. to the lowest and utmost ebb of
disgrace and misery, (...).

Verse 14. And while they were yet talking with him] But could not yield him
one word of comfort. He hoped happily that they would have found out for him some
good occasion, some mean of supplanting Mordecai, now his Corival and
Counter-factionist, and of incensing the King against him, that he might build
upon his ruins. But the hope of unjust men shall perish, Prove. 11.7. ( Etiam
spes valentissimo perit, so some render it,) and themselves with it. As Haman
had not one to speak for him, when the King frowned upon him: so here he has
not one to speak to his heart, or to shore him up, now that he is upon the
fall. (...). 1 Cor. 3.19.
Those that before took crafty counsel against Gods people, and consulted
against his hidden ones, Psalm. 83.3. are now at their wits end, as seeing
themselves taken (as wild beasts in a snare,) in their own craftiness, yea,
they are mad for the sight of their eyes, which that day they should see, Deuteronomy.
28.34.

Came the Kings Chamberlaines, and hasted to bring Haman Heb. and hurried and
headlonged in a turbulent manner: for it may be the King and Queen tarried for
him. Could he have been any way excused, he had no such mind to have gone. For
his stomach was full, and what if he should meet Mordecai the new Favorite
there, and see him set above him? But now it is no time to consult further with
friends, or cast perils by himself. Lib. 1 l. c. 6.
Harbonah hasteneth him, having first taken notice of the lofty Gallows, and
(as Josephus says) asked of one of the servants of the house what it meant,
and for whom it was prepared? See chap. 7.9.

Unto the banquet that Esther had prepared] That fatal feast, Vbi manducaret
quod apud inferos digereret, Au^gust.
where his meat in his bowels was turned, it became the gall of aspes within
him, Job 20.14. why then should any Saint envy the wicked man his fed bits, his
murdering morsels? is not his meat sawced, his drink spiced with the bitter
wrath of God? Adoniah's feast ended in horror: the ears of his guests were
filled, (because their bellies had prepared deceit, Job 15.35.) with the sound
of those trumpets, which at once proclaim Solomon's triumph, and their
confusion. Ever after the meal is ended, comes the reckoning; but at this
banquet of Esther it came before, chap. 7.2. And Haman sped not so well as
Caesar Borgia's Nobles, whom he invited to a feast, and after they had well
d^ned, he cut off their heads.

CHAP. VII. Verse 1. So the King and Haman came to the banquet.]
HEb. to drink, for multorum vivere est bibere: and profane persons have a
Proverb, Bibere and sudare est vita Cardiaci: Such are your chamber-Champions:
whose teeth in a temperate air, do beat in their heads at a cup of cold sack
and sugar. Gr^g. Posthu^
Belshazzars feast-dayes were called (...): because he was quaffing in the
bowls of the Sanctuary, to the honor of Shac or Bacchus. Little did either he
or Haman think, that in the fullness of their sufficiency, they should be in
such straits, and that every hand of the troublesome should come upon him: that
when they were about to fill their bellies, God should cast the fury of his
wrath upon them, and rain it upon them whiles they were drinking, Job 20.22,
23. But, this is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
appointed unto him by God, verse 29. Why then should any Saint be sick of the
fret, at the prosperity of the ungodly? surely, as fishes are taken in an evil
net, and as birds are caught in a snare, so are such snared in an evil time,
when it falls suddenly upon them; Eccles. 9.12. Of Esthers invitation Haman
might have said, as he did of the gifts one sent him, Munera magna quidem
mittit, sed mittit in hamo. Martial.
But he knew not yet what evil was toward him; though I doubt not but his
conscience, (if not altogether dead and dedolent) began by this time to stare
him in the face; his friends having already read his destiny.

Verse 2. And the King said again unto Esther] He was very desirous to know
what her suit was; and with thought thereof, as it may seem, could not rest the
night before. He pursues his desires, not a little edged by her delays;
neither was he of those lusks, who Remque aliquam exoptant, intabescuntque
relicta. His love to Esther made him ask again, What is thy petition, and what
is thy request, etc? He presses her to speak out, so does God his Suppliants.
Hitherto ye have asked nothing, ask that your joy may be full. Pray that ye may
joy; ye are not straitened in me, but in your own bowels: as, if no water come
by the conduit, it is not because there is none in the spring, but because the
pipes are broken. See the Note on chapter 5.6.

Verse 3. Then Esther the Queen, etc.] See chapter 5.7, 8. As Abigail, her
family; and the woman of Abel, the City: so does Esthe^ by her wisdom and
humility deliver herself and her people, ducem sequens lucem fidei, as one
says of her.

Let my life be given me at my Petition] Heb. my soul. See how discreetly she
marshalleth her words: setting these two great requests in the head of her
petition, which is simplex and non fucata, plain and downright. Truth is like
our first Parents, most beautiful when naked. Our words in prayer must be neque
lecta, neque neglecta, neither curious nor careless; but as the words of
Petitioners, plain and full, and direct to the point. Esther reckons her
self here among the rest of her poor Countrymen, free among the dead, free of
that company, and begs for her life and theirs together; because hers was even
bound ^p in theirs. Mortis habet vices quae trabitur vita genuitibus; to live
after their death would be a lifelesse life; and hence her importunity for both
together* since they were in her heart, ad commoriendum and convivendum, if they
died she could not live. Good blood will not belie it self. Esther had not
showed her kindred and people till now, that she must appear for them. See the
like in Moses, Heb. John 19.3^
11.25. in Nicodemus that night-bird, John 7.51. he speaks boldly and silences
the whole company, John 19. he boldly beggeth the body of Jesus; neither could
he any longer conceal himself. Surely, as Solomon by trial found out the true
harlot-mother, so does God by hard times descry the affections of his people.
Then, as Joseph could not refrain tears, so nor they the exercise of their
faith and charity.

Verse 4. For we are sold] i. e. given up wholly into the power of the enemy,
as that which a man has bought with his money, is his own to dispose of. She
referres, doubtless to the sum proffered by Haman, chap. 3.9. not fearing
the face of so potent an enemy, nor going behind his back to set him out in his
colors; yea, though her discourse could not but somewhat reflect upon the
King, who had given Haman his consent.

I, and my people] She makes it a common cause, and says to her Countrymen,
as once David did to Abiathar, 1 Samuel 22.23. or, as Charles the fifth said to
Julius Pestugius, who complained that he had been much wronged by the Duke of
Saxony. Have a little patience, thy cause shall be my cause, neither will I sit
down till I have seen you some way righted. See verse 3.

To be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish] These were the very words of that
bloody decree which she purposely makes use of, that he might be sensible of
what he had consented to: and might see that she complained not without cause.
But what a case was Haman in at the hearing of this? and how did he now repent
him, but too late, of ever having a hand in so bloody a business? His iniquity
was now full, and the bottle of his wickedness filled up to the brim with
those bitter waters, was even about to sink to the bottom. His Gallows was
finished last night, and now it groaned hard for him, that he might be
destroyed, slain and made to perish.

-- Neque enim lex justior ulla est,
Quam necis artifices art perire sua.
But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen] Though it had been an hard
and sad condition for a Queen, especially (which yet was Hecuba's case and
Zenobia's) yet it would not be grievous to them to sacrifice their liberty to
the service of their life: the Gibeonites were glad they might live upon any
terms, Josh. 9.16. Masters might slay their bondservants, but that was counted
a cruelty, and when one did it at Rome, he was amerced by the Censor: many
times they were manumitted for their good service, and came to great estates.

I had held my tongue] Silence is in some cases a crying sin. Taciturnity, I
confess, is sometimes a virtue, but not at all where it tends to the betraying
of a good cause, or the detriment of the laboring Church. For Zions sake I
will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalems sake I will not rest, etc. Esaias
62.1. Terentius that noble General told Vatens the Arian Emperor, ^^^eph l.
11. (...).
that he had abandoned the victory and sent it to the enemy, by his persecuting
Gods people, and favoring heretics. That was an excellent saying of Hierome
to Vigilantius, Meam injuriam patienter tuli, etc. whiles the wrong thou did,
reached only to my self, I took it patiently; but thy wickedness against God I
cannot bear with: so was that of Occolampadius to Servetus, (blaming him for
his sharpness to the self-same purpose. And lastly, that of Luther in a letter
to his friend Staupi^ius. Inveniar sane superbus, etc. Let me be accounted
proud, peremptory, passionate, or what men please, so that I be not found
guilty of a sinful silence, when called to speak for God.

Although the enemy could not countervaile the Kings damage] q.d. It is not his
ten thousand talents, chapter 3.9. nor all that he is worth, and ten more such as
he is, that can make up the loss, that the King is sure to sustain by the
slaughter of the Jews, a people painful and prayerful, (this, Darius made high
account of, Ezra 6.16.) useful and profitable, careful to maintain good works
in St. Paul's sense, Tit. 3.8. that is, such as were noted to exceed and excel
others in witty inventions, to be their Craftsmasters, and faithful to their
trust. Besides, if they be taken away, great damage shall redound to the Kings
revenue, by non-payment of toll, tribute and custom, as those Malignants could
allege, Ezra 4.12. a thing that Princes usually are very sensible of. Or if
there should be lucrum in arca, yet there would he damnum in conscientia, the
foul blurre of blood-guiltinesse would lie heavy, both upon the Kings
conscience, and his name among all Nations. The Vulgar renders this text thus,
Nunc autem hostis noster est, cujus crudelitas redundat in reg^m. And now he is
our enemy, whose cruelty reflecteth upon the King. Tremelius thus, S^d non est
hostis iste utilis, damnosus est regi; but now this enemy is no way profitable,
but to the King disadvantageous. This the King considers not, and the enemy
cares not, so that he may serve his own turn, and satisfy his murtherous
mind.

Verse 5. Then the King Ahashuerus answered, etc.] It seems he did not yet, by
all that Esther had said, understand whom she meant: so high an opinion he had
of Haman his minion, the only ornament and bulwark of the Empire, the greatest
Publicola, Quis hic ipse^ and ubi hic ill^
and most esteemed Patriot. The King therefore, as not thinking him so near
hand, hastily asks, He said and said, (so the Heb. has it) to the Queen.

Who is he, and where is he?] Who is that Sirrah, he, and where is that Sirrah,
he? words of utmost indignation and readiness to be revenged: such as were
those of Charles the fifth Emperor. If that Villain were here (speaking of
Farnesius the Popes General, P^raei. Medu^ Hist. ^rofan. Era^m ep. l. 1^ ad
obtrectat.
who had ravished certain Ladies) I would kill him with mine own hand or those
of fiery Friar, who openly in the Pulpit at Antwerp, preaching to the people,
wished that Luther were there, that he might tear him with his teeth. But could
this King possibly so soon forget what himself had not two months before
granted to be done against Esthers people, (which was with his right hand to
cut off his left?) or did he not all this while know what Countrey-woman his
beloved Esther was? and might he not expect that the Hamanists should come and
take her forcibly from him to execution, by virtue of his own Edict, as Daniels
adversaries had dealt by him, though Darius labored till the going down of the
Sun to deliver him, but could not, Dan. 6.14? and as Steven Gardener and his
Accomplices attempted to do by Queen Katherine Parre, had not her husband Henry
the eighth rated them away, and graciously rescued her out of their bloody
fingers?

That durst presume in his heart to do so] Heb. Whose heart has filled him to
do so? Cujus cor persuasit ipsi, so Vatablus. Whose heart has persuaded him
thus to do. The devil had filled Hamans heart, sitting a brood thereon, and
hatching there this horrid plot, Acts 5.3. But (to do the devil right) Haman
had suffered the Sun, (nay many Suns) to go down upon his wrath, and thereby
given place to the devil, Ephesians. 4.26, 27. Nemo sibi de suo palpet (says an
Ancient) quisque sibi Satan est; Let no man deceive his own heart, each man is
a Satan to himself; and though men bless themselves from having to do with the
devil, and spet at his very name, yet they fetch not up their spettle low
enough; they spet him out of their mouths, but not out of their hearts, as
being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness,
covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity,
Rom 1.29. Hamans heart thus stuffed might well have said to him at the Gallows,
as the heart of Apollodorus the Tyrant seemed to say to him, who dreamed one
night that he was fleaed by the Scythians, and boiled in a Cauldron, and that
his heart spoke to him out of the kettle. (...).
It is I that have drawn thee to all this. Those in hell cry so surely.

Verse 6. And Esther said] Now she found her time to strike whiles the iron was
hot: she therefore lays hold upon the opportunity that God had even thrust
into her hand, and, laying aside all base fear, points out the enemy
present, and painteth him out in his proper colors. A well-chosen season,
says one, is the greatest advantage of any action; which as it is seldom
found in haste, so it is too often lost in delay. Aug.
It is not for Queen Esther now to drive off any longer. The negligent spirit
cries, Cras Domine, To morrow thou shall pray for me, said Pharaoh to Moses,
Fools are ever futuring, semper victuri, as Seneca has it, but a wise man's
heart discerns both time and judgment, Eccles. 8.5. The men of Issachar in
David's days were in great account, because they had understanding of the times
to know what Israel ought to do, and when to do it, 1 Chronicles. 12.32.

The adversary] Heb. The man adversary, the Lycanthropos, the man of might that
distresseth us, angustiator, that is, our calamity; as the people of Rome once
by an elegant solecisme, cried out, Calamitas nostra Magnus est: meaning it of
Pompey sir-named Magnus.

And enemy] That is, the utter enemy, that sworn Swordman of Satan, the old
manslayer, from whom Haman has drawn this ancient enmity, Genesis 3.15.

Is this wicked Haman] Pessimus iste, this homo hominum quantum est, pessimus,
homo post homines natos nequissimus, as wicked a man as goes on two legs, a
Merum scelus, a man made up of mischief, Bipedum n^ quissimus.
a very breathing devil. Cicero tells of one Tubulus, who was Praetor a
little before his time, so wicked a wretch, Vt ejus nomen non hominis sed vitu
esse vider^tur, that his name seemed to be not the name of a man, but of vice
it self. And Josephus says of Antipater, (...).
that his life was a very mystery of iniquity. Think the same of Haman so
portentously, so peerlesly wicked and malicious, that Esther can find no word
bad enough for him, (...).
unless it be Harang, that naughtiest of all naughts, as Saint Paul could call
sin no worse then by its own name sinful sin, exceeding sinful, Romans 7.13.
Tiberius was rightly characterized by his Tutour Theodorus Gadareus, dirt kned
with blood; Haman was such another, if not worse, and now he hears of it: for
never till now did the man adversary hear his true title. Before, some had
styled him Noble, others Great; some magnificent, and some perhaps virtuous:
only Esther gives him his own, wicked Haman. Ill-deserving greatness does in
vain promise to it self a perpetuity of applause. There will be those that will
deal plainly, and call a spade, a spade. Thus Jeremy dealt with Jehoiakim, and
Ezekiel with Zedekiah, whom he calls naught and polluted. Go tell that fox,
says our Savior, concerning Herod; and God shall smite thee, thou whited
wall, says Paul to Ananias. But what a courage had Esther to speak thus to the
King, and of his Favorite, and before his face? This was the work of her
faith, and the fruit of her prayer.

The Haman was afraid before the King and the Queen] He was amazed and amated,
troubled and terrified. Obstupuit, steteruntque comae, and vox faucibus haesit.
Virg.
In the fullness of his sufficiency he fell into straits, Job. 29.22. So that
being convinced in his own conscience that the Queens accusation was very true,
and that the King knew it to be so, he had nothing to say for himself, he was
even gagged, as it were, or muzled, as Mat 22.12. according to that of David,
Psalm. 63.11. the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped. And again,
Psalm. 12.3. The Lord shall cut off lying lips, and the tongue that speaks
proud things. Here we see how suddenly wicked ones may be cast down upon the
discovery of their wickedness, in the height of their pride, in the ruff of
their jollity, as was Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, Herod, Haman. Surely as
thunder commonly is heard when the sky seems most clear: so this man saw
himself enveloped in a storm, in one of the fairest days that ever befell him.

Verse 7. And the King arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath] As not
able to abide the sight of such a caitiffe, he flings away in a chafe. This
wrath of the King was to Haman a messenger of death: and so he apprehended it,
as appears by that which follows. Ashamed the King was, and vexed, that his
favor and power had been so much abused, to the hazarding of the Queens life,
and the taking away the lives of so many innocents. It troubled him also to
consider how he had lost his love upon so unworthy a wretch, and trusted him
with his secrets, whom now he finds treacherous, and all for his own ends.
This King should first have fallen out with himself for his rashness, and then
have said as Alphonsus, that renowned King, did in a speech to the Popes
Ambassador: he professed that he did not so much wonder at his Courtiers
ingratitude to him, who had raised sundry of them from mean to great estates,
as at his own to God. This one consideration would have cooled him better then
the repeating of the Greek Alphabet, or his taking a turn in the Palace
Garden, before he passed sentence upon the Delinquent. Rex amici memor,
paulisper cunctatur, deliberandique gratia modicum secessit, says Severus:
that is, the King mindful of the friendship that had been betwixt him and
Haman, makes a pause, and retireth for a while, that he may deliberate with
himself what to do. If these were the reasons, it was a piece of prudence in
the King, for anger is known to be an evil counselour, and as smoke in a man's
eyes hinders his sight, so does rash anger the use of reason. De sera numinis
Vindic.
Hence wise men have refrained the act when angry: Plutarch tells of one
Architas, that displeased with his servants for their sloth, he flung from
them, saying, Valete, quoniam vobis irascor: farewell, for I am angry with you,
and may not therefore meddle with you. Vapulares, nisi irascerer, I would pay
thee, but that I am displeased at thee, said Plato to a servant of his. And of
Alphonsus King of Arragon it is reported, that vexed at his Cup-bearers
stubbornness, Val. M^x. Christ. l. ^. c. 20
he drew his dagger and ran after him: but before he came at him he threw away
his dagger, nejam prehensum iratus feriret, lest he should catch him and kill
him in the heat of his anger. This was better then Saul's casting a javelin at
Jonathan, Alexanders killing of his friend Clitus and others in his drink,
Herod's commanding the Keepers of the prison to execution, Acts 12.19. Whether
Ahashuerus went into the garden (as Jonathan took his Artillery and went into
the field) to divert and mitigate his anger, is uncertain. Possibly he might do
that to edge and increase it. Of Tiberius it is storied, that the more he
meditated revenge, Lentus in (...) d^tando tri^ ribus dictis (...) trocia facta
^ jungebat. (...)
the more did time and delay sharpen it: and the farther off he threatened, the
heavier the stroke fell. Most certain it is, that Haman gat little by the Kings
going into the garden; for upon his return, he was the more enraged: Nempe
impiis omnia ad malum cooperantur, says Lavater, to the wicked all things work
together for the worse.

And Haman stood up to make request for his life] See what a strange turn of
things here was all upon the sudden. He that was bowed unto by all men, is now
upon his knees before a woman. He that was erst the professed enemy of the
Jews, is now suppliant to a Jewesse. He that had contrived the death of that
whole people, is now begging for his own life. He that had provided a Gallows
for Mordecai, fears nothing more now, then that himself shall be hanged on it.

Discite justitiam moniti, and non temnere sanctos. Haman hoped that Esther
would have interceded for him to the King, but there was little reason for it:
a drowning man will catch hold on any twig. Esther knew him too well, to
befriend him so far. Let him have judgment without mercy (thinks she) who
showed no mercy. Quisquam nec ipsum supplicem,
Quamvis jacentem sublevet.
Psalm. 109. Let him lie for me, and die according to his deserts. A man that
does violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; Let no man stay
him, Prove. 28.17. to mediate for such an one, is no mercy: neither is it any
almes-deed, as we say; for, save a Rogue from the Gallows and he will cut your
throat if he can, as the proverb has it, and experience has confirmed it.
Magnentius slew Constans the Emperor, Anno Dom. 337. who had formerly saved
his life from the soldiers fury. Speed.
Parry the Traitor offered the lie to Queen Elizabeth, who had pardoned him
after that he had been condemned to die for burglary. Michael Balbus slew his
Master Leo Armenius the Emperor that same night that he had pardoned him, and
released him out of prison. Zonar A^^
Those that are habituated and hardened in wickedness, will not be mollified
or mended by any kindness that is shown them.

For he saw that there was evil determined against him] Vidit quod completum
esset malum, rem ad restim rediisse; He perceived himself to be altogether in
as ill a condition, Speed^
as Judge Belknap in Richard the second his time, who said there wanted but an
hurdle, an horse, and a halter, to have him to the place where he might have
his due; where he might wear a Tyburne-tippet, as father Latimer afterward
phraseth it.

Verse 8. Then the King returned one of the Palace-Garden] Where he had either
increased his choler, and cast on more fuel by plodding, or (as some think)
strove to digest it, as horses do by biting on the bit.

Vt fragilis glacies occidit ira mora. Ovid.
Unto the house of the banquet of wine] Called also by the Hebrew Beth-mittoth,
Stuccius tiq. Cor^
the house of beds triclinium: because at beds they used to sit, as we do at
tables to eat and drink. See chap. 1.6.

And Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was] he had stood up before,
(for he saw the Queen took no felicity in his company) to make request for his
life, which now was in suspense; here he falls down, either as swooning, or
supplicating at the Queens feet, to beg her favor. But she very well knew,
that there is both a cruel mercy, and a pious cruelty, and that although the
sword of justice should be furbished with the oil of mercy, yet there are
cases (and this was one) wherein severity ought to cast the scale: when there
is no hope of curing, men must fall to cutting: Immedicabile vulnus, etc.

Then said the King, will be force the Queen also] Haman had little mind of
any such matter, as being now in the hands of the King of terrors, and ready
to be devoured by the firstborn of death, as Bildad has it, Job 18.13. But
the angry King was willing to misinterpret him, and to take all things at the
worst. It is an easy matter to find a cudgel for a dog, to pick a quarrel
where men intend a mischief Ahashuerus was not, unwilling to misconstrue the
posture of Hamans body, whiles prostrate he spread his arms in a vehement
imploration up to the Queens bed. How often might he have done so and more,
whilst he was in favor, uncensured? Actions are not the same when the man
alters. Men either judge or not judge as their passions and affections carry
them. See this Acts 23.9. Before Paul had discovered himself to be a Pharisee,
this man is not worthy to live, said they, but when he had cried out in the
Council, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee, oh how finely do they mince
the matter? Perhaps an Angel bath revealed it to him, etc. Paul was an honest
man then. Impedit ira animum, ne possit cernere verum. But though the King were
unjust in judging thus amiss of Haman, yet God was righteous in measuring to
him as he had meted to others, by belying and slandering so many innocents as
he had designed to destruction. The devil was and still is, first a liar, and
then a murderer, he cannot murder without he slander first. But God loves to
retaliate and proportion device to device, Mic. 2.1, 3. frowardness to
frowardness, Ps. 18.26. spoiling to spoiling, Esa. 33.1. tribulation to them
that trouble his people, 2 These. 1.6.

As the word went out of the Kings mouth] Either the former words, or else some
words of command not here related, such as are Corripite, velate vultum, take
him away, cover his face. And this word was to Haman the messenger of death,
driving him from the light into darkness, and chasing him out of the world,
Job 18.18. Nay worse. That book of Job elegantly sets forth the misery of a
wicked man dying, under the notion of one not only driven out of the light by
devils, where he shall see nothing but his tormentors, but also made to stand
upon shares or grinnes with iron teeth, ready to strike up and grind him to
pieces, having gall poured down to his belly, with an instrument raking in his
bowels, and the pains of a traveling woman upon him, and an hideous noise of
horror in his ears, Job. 18.18. and 20.24, 15. and 15.20, 21, 26, 30.
and a great Giant with a spear running upon his neck, and a flame burning
upon him round about, etc. and yet all this to hell it self is but as a prick
with a pin, or a flea-biting.

They covered Hamans face] In token of his irrevocable condition. See Job 9.24.
Esa. 22.17. The Turks cast a black gown upon such, as they sit at supper with
the great Turk, Grand. Sign. Serag. 148.
and presently strangle them. Many of their Visiers or greatest Favorites die
in this sort, which makes them use this proverb, He that is greatest in office
is but a Statue of glass. Plutarch wittily compares great men to counters,
which now stand for a thousand pound, and anon for a farthing. -- Sic transit
gloria mundi. Quem dies veniens vidit superbum,
Hunc dies abiens vidit jacentem.
Haman for instance, and so Sejanus, the same Senators who accompanied him to
the Senate, conducted him to prison; they which sacrificed unto him as to their
god, which kneeled down to adore him, scoffed at him, seeing him dragged from
the Temple to the Goal, from supreme honor, to extreme ignominy. Ludit in
humanis divina potentia rebus. ^ertinax Imp. fortunae pila dictus est.
One reason why the King flang out of the room, and went into the Palace-garden,
might be because he could not endure the sight of Haman any more. Wherefore
upon his return they instantly covered his face. Some say, the manner was, that
when the King of Persia was most highly offended with any man, Tanquam indignus
qui regem oculis u^rparet Drus Sen. Tac. Tull. pro Rab. Live.
his face was immediately covered, to show that he was unworthy to see the Sun,
whom they counted their god; or to be an eyesore to the displeased King. Among
the Romans it was, Majestas laesa si exe^^ti Proconsulimerettix non sun
movetur, high treason for any Strumpet to stand in the Proconsuls way,
whenever he came abroad. The statues of the gods were transported or covered
in those places where any punishment was inflicted. That in Tully and Livy is
well known, I^lictor colliga manus, caput abnubito, arbori infelici
suspendito. Go Hangman, bind his hands, cover his face, hang him on the
Gallow-tree. This was their condemnatory sentence.

Verse 9. And Harbonah one of the Kings Chamberlaines, etc.] See chapter 6.14.
with the Note.

Said before the King] Not a man opens his mouth to speak for Haman, but all
against him. Had the cause been better, thus it would have been. Every curre is
ready to fall upon the dog that he sees worried; every man ready to pull a
branch from the tree is falling. Cromwell had experience of this when once he
fell into displeasure, (...). Speed.
by speaking against the Kings match with Lady Katherine Howard, in defense of
Queen Anne of Cleeve, and discharge of his conscience, for the which he
suffered death, Steven Gardener being the chief Engineere. Had Hamans cause
been like his, albeit he had found as few friends to intercede for him as
Cromwell, yet he might have died with as much comfort as he did. But he died
more like to the Lord Hungerford of Hatesby, Speed.
who was beheaded together with the noble Cromwell, but neither so Christianly
suffering, nor so quietly dying for his offense committed against nature, viz.
buggery. Cromwell exhorted him to repent, and promised him mercy from God; but
his heart was hardened, and so was this wicked Hamans. God therefore justly set
off all hearts from him in his greatest necessity; and now, to add to his
misery, brings another of his foul sins to light, that he might the more
condignely be cut off.

Behold also the Gallowe^, fifty cubits high] See chap. 5.14. This the Queen
knew not of when she petitioned against Haman. But now they all hear of it for
Hamans utter confusion.

Which he had prepared for Mordecai] At a time when the King had done him
greatest honor, as his Preserver and near Ally by marriage, as now it
appeared. This must needs reflect upon the King, and be a reproach to him.
Besides, the King looked upon him, as one that went about either to throttle
the Queen, (as some understand the words, verse 8.) or to ravish her: and this
was just upon him, say some Interpreters, eo quo aliis virginibus and matronis
vini intulisset, because it was common with him to ravish other maids and
matrons, and hence the Kings suspicion and charge, whereof before.

Who had spoken good for the King] All is now for Mordecai, but not a word for
Haman; the rising Sun shall be sure to be adored. And the contrary, Sejanus his
friends showed themselves most passionate against him, when once the Emperor
frowned upon him, saying, that if Caesar had clemency, he ought to reserve it
for men, and not use it toward monsters. This is Courtiers custom, ad
quamlibet auram sese inclinare, to shift their sails to the sitting of every
wind, to comply with the King which way soever he enclineth. It is better
therefore to put trust in the Lord, then to put confidence in man. It is better
to trust in the Lord, then to put confidence in Princes, Psalm. 118.8, 9. If
Harbonah spoke this out of hatred of Hamans insolency, and in favor of
Mordecai's innocence and loyalty, he deserved commendation. Howsoever Gods holy
hand was in it for the good of his people, and overthrow of their enemy; and
little did this night-sprung-Mushrom Haman, (that sucked the earths fatness
from far better plants then himself) take notice till now, of the many hands
ready to pluck him up by the roots, when the season should serve to clear the
land of such weeds.

Stands is the house of Haman] Or, by the house of Haman, that he might feed
his eyes with that delightful sight, and cry out, as Hannibal did when he saw a
ditch filled with man's blood, O jucundum spectaculum, O pleasant Spectacle. The
Story of that King of France is well known, who vowed to see a certain Martyr
executed; but before that could be done, had his eye put out at a Justes,
whereof not long after also he died. And that of Sir Ralph Ellerker Governonr
of Callice in King Henry the eighths time, who at the death of Adam Damlip
Martyr, called to the Executioner, saying Dispatch the Knave, have done, I will
not away before I see the Traitors heart out. But shortly after in a skirmish
betwixt the French and us at Bullen, this Knight was not only slain among
others, but stripped dismembered, and his heart rip't out, and so left a terrible
example, Act. and Mex. fol. 1120.
says Mr. Fox of Gods justice to all bloody and merciless men. Thou should
not have looked, etc. Obad. 12. See the Note there.

Then the King said, Hang him thereon] The Kings of Persia, had absolute and
unquestionable power to do whatsoever they listed. Quicquid libuit, licuit. All
their subjects except their Queens, were no better then their slaves, whom they
would they slew, and whom they would they kept alive: whom they would they set
up, and whom they would they put down, Dan. 5.19. Haman is here without order
of law, more then the Kings command, adjudged to be hanged. The truth is, it
was a clear case, and the malefactor was self-condemned; Hang him therefore,
says the King, a short and just sentence, and soon executed.

Verse 10. So they hanged Haman on the Gallowes] Heb. tree. Neither hanged they
him only to death: but crucified or nailed his dead body to the tree, for
greater ignominy. So some gather from chap. 8.5. The Septuagint also render it:
So they crucified him. And here hanged the greatness of Haman, who now is
fallen from the Palace to the Gallows, from the highest stage of honor, to
the lowest staire of disgrace, and lies wrapped up in the sheet of perpetual
infamy. So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord, etc. A like end befell Bonosus
the drunken Emperor; Amasis that insolent King of Egypt; Joane that libidinous
Queen of Naples; our Roger Mortimer, that Troubler of the Realm hanged at
Tyburne; Oliver that proud Prefect, advanced to highest honors and offices by
Lewis King of France, Cranz l. 12. c. 17.
but hanged up by his son and successor upon a new and large Gallows, set
up for the purpose, and not without his desert. High places are not more
uneasy then slippery. Even height it self makes men's brains to swim, and when
they fall they come down with a poise.

That he had prepared for Mordecai] Josephus has here a very good Note; Vnde
mihi contigit mirari nomen Dei, and sapientiam and justitiam ejus agnoscere,
etc. I cannot but admire the Lords wisdom, Lib. ^1. Antiq. c. 6.
and acknowledge his justice, in that he not only punished him for his malice
to the Church, but by turning his own mischief upon himself, has made him an
example to all posterity, hanging him up in gibbets that others may take
warning. The like the Lord did by Adonibezek, Pharaoh, Goliath, Achitophel,
Absalom, Sennacherib, Maxentius, Valerianus, etc. Quam been dispositum terris
ut dignus iniqui, Claud. lib. in Eutrop.

Fructus consilii primis authoribus instet, etc.
See those sacred Similies to the same sense, Eccles. 10.8, 9. Prove. 26.27.
Psalm. 7.16. etc. (...) Hesiod Lib 8 de viz. verb, c. 21.
and beware of making a match with mischief, lest ye have your belly-full
thereof. He that conceives with guile, shall (though he grow never so big)
bring forth nothing but vanity and worse, Job 15.35. As he has sown the
wind, so he shall reap the whirlwinde, Hos. 8.6. See the Note there. Diaboli
servus and satelles praecipuus erat Haman, says Rupertus. Haman was a main
stickler for the devil, who paid him accordingly; the wages of sin is death,
and it may well be feared that Haman was killed with death, Lavat. in loc.
as Jezaebels children were, Rev. 2.23 Fuit enim homo dirae feritatis planeque
(...), for he was a most cruel wretch, and a plain Atheist. I shall shut up the
story of his life, Amb. de Nab. Isr. c 11.
as Ambrose does that of Ahab and Jezabels fearful end. Fuge ergo, dives
ejusmodi exitum, etc. Tremble at such ends, and be careful to avoid them. Such
ends ye shall easily avoid, if ye carefully fly such like foul and flagitious
practices.

Then was the Kings wrath pacified] Harbonah had helped to kindle it, verse 9.
and by executing Haman, Sententiam ocyus dicto exequuntur oculici. Merl.
whom he had accused, he now helps to quench it. For it was not unusual of
old, that men of greatest rank and quality should execute Malefactors, as
Gideon did Zeba and Zalmunnah, as Samuel did Agag, as Benaiah did Adonijah,
Joab and Shimei, by the command of Solomon. The holy Angels delight in such an
office, as at Sodom, and in Sennacheribs army: and how active shall they be at
the last day, but chiefly against such as walk after the flesh in the lust of
uncleanness, and despise Government, 2 Pet. 2.10. So shall Gods wrath be
pacified, as once it was when Phineas the High Priest had done execution upon
that unclean couple. The Saints have another way of pacifying him; of
preventing his judgments, and disarming his indignation: and that is by
remembering their sins, and being confounded in his Presence, never opening
their mouths any more, Ez^ch. 16.63.
unless it be in an humble confession, which is the Christians best Apology?
as the Apostle calls it, 2 Cor. 7.11. This will quiet Gods Spirit (as the
phrase is, Zech. 6.8. and cause him to say as Job 33.24. I have found a
reconciliation. Surely, if we judge our selves, he will not judge us, 1 Cor.
11.31. God shall be prevented, and the Accuser of the brethren put out of
office; our Hamans also shall be hanged up before the Sun, our sturdy
corruptions crucified, and the Lord shall as little repent him of any good he
has done us, as Ahashuerus did of gratifying his wife Esther, and Kinsman
Mordecai; who were now all the doers, seeking the wealth of Israel, and
speaking peace to that whole people, as appears in the following chapters. As
for the King he never so much as once lamented the loss of Haman, nor said, se
properantius quam prudentius egisse, that he had been more hasty then wise in
doing him to death; but was very well pleased with what he had done; his wrath
rested, says the text, Ira est libido puniendi eju^ qui videtur laesi^le
injuria ^icero.
as the sea does in a calm: it lay and slept, as the word signifies; for
anger is an eager desire of revenge, and renders a man restless, till that be
done.

CHAP. VIII. Verse 1. On that day]
THis was a festival and a good day, as verse. 17. albo lapillo notandus, for
the many signal mercies that thereon came in together; viz. Esthers Petition
granted, Haman hanged, Mordecai advanced, the proscribed Jews relieved, etc. As
crosses seldom come single, but trooping together commonly, and treading upon
the heels of one another, Catenata piorun crux.
like Jobs messengers, James 1.2. So do blessings from God; there is often a
continued Series, a Concatenation; there comes a troop, as she said, when her
son Gad came. Genesis 30.11.
God is rich in mercy, Romans 10.12. Neither are we at any time straitened in
him, but in our own bowels.

Did the King Ahashuerus give] For into the Kings hands was all Hamans estate
forfeited. The Turks have a Proverb, He that is greatest in office, is but a
statue of glass. Few of their Visiers die in their beds, but are cut off at a
short warning, and all they have is confiscate.

The house of Haman] i. e. his goods and chattels, all that glory of his
riches, whereof he had so greatly boasted, chap. 5.11. and which he had been so
many years heaping and hoarding. Nemo confidat nimirum secundis.

The Jews enemy] It is ill being the Churches enemy: she has a champion that
will stick to her, Esaias 37.23. so that her enemies shall all be found liars
unto her, Deuteronomy. 33.29. Let them read their destiny in that cup of trembling,
burdensome stone, hearth of fire mentioned, Zech. 12.2, 3, 6. and here the
Churches Motto, Nemo me impune lacessit; Victa tamen vinces, eversaque
Troiaresurges
there cannot be a greater folly then to be her enemy; for she conquereth even
when conquered: as Christ overcame as well by patience, as by power.

Unto Esther the Queen] So making good that of Solomon, Prove. 13.22. See Job
27.16, 17.
The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. Thus was that of the
Canaanites for the Israelites, of Nabal for David, of the former tyrants and
persecutors; for Constantine the Great, to whom the good God (says Austin)
gave so much worldly wealth, Quantas optare nullus auderet, as no man could
ever have wished. De C. D. l. 5. c. 25.
That Haman was exceeding rich, appears by that large offer of his, chap.
3.9. who can tell, but that he might have as much as Pope John the 22. in whose
coffers were found by his heirs two hundred and fifty tons of gold, as
Petrarch reports.

And Mordecai came before the King] As his continual Attendant and special
Favorite; his Cousin and Counselor: perhaps one of the seven mentioned,
chap. 1, 14. He that hitherto sat as a servant before the Kings gate, is now
grown so great a man all upon the sudden. It is the Lord that thus raises up
the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill to set
them among Princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory, 1 Samuel 2.8.
Promotion comes neither from the East; West, nor South. (where the warm
Sunshine is) but God is the Judge, he puts down one, and sets up
another, Psalm. 75.6, 7. He advanced Jovinian and Valentinian, men of low birth,
to the Empire. In the year of grace 518. Justinus was first a Swineherd, then
an Herdsman, then a Carpenter, then a Soldier, and lastly an Emperor.
Cromwella Smiths son of Putney or thereabouts, Act. and Mon
(whose mother married after to a Sheerman) what a great man grew he here to be
in King Henry the eighths time? Virtue exalts the meanest, when villainy
tumbleth down the noblest.

For Esther had told what he was unto her] Viz. her Cousin-germane and
foster-father, her friend that was as her own soul, as Moses phraseth it,
Deuteronomy. 13.6. and prefers him before brother, son, daughter, wife. This his
relation to Esther was as a Stirrup to help him into the Saddle of highest
preferment.

Verse 2. And the King took off bis ring] As a sign of intimate friendship,
and a bond of strictest league of love. Lib. 1. c. 26.
That this was usual among the Persians, is testified by Alexander ab
Alexandro. Of Alexander the great it is storied, that when he died, he left his
ring to his dearest friend Perdiccas, but his dominions (...) to the Worthiest.
This set up Competitours. and bred much trouble. Ahashuerus knew that a
worthier then Mordecai he could not easily find, and therefore besides that
momentary honor he had newly done him, chap. 6.10. he now not only by this
ring admits him into nearest friendship, but, as some think, advances him
to be Keeper of the Seal, and Lord Chancellor of all the Empire.

Which he had taken from Haman] And so degraded and exauthorated him before his
execution: this is usual.

And gave it unto Mordecai] Acknowledging thereby his error in promoting so
unworthy a man before: whom having punished for his deserts, he here pitcheth
upon a better. En Imperatorem valde terribilem nec minus Clementem, as
Frederick the Electour of Saxony said of Charles the fifth. Let Ahashuerus be
what he will, Almighty God is in this text set forth as bountiful to his
people, and terrible to his enemies. See Psalm. 34.15, 16.

And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman] As her chief Steward, to see
that every thing went right, and were put to the best. Hamans sons lived some
months after this, but were outed of all. An inheritance may be gotten hastily
at the beginning, but the end thereof shall not be blessed, Prove. 20.21. He
that by usury and unjust gain increases his substance, he shall gather it for
him that will pity the poor, Prove. 28.8. God will provide him both an Executour
and an Overseer, as here he did Haman.

Verse 3. Nec his contenta Esther. Vulg.
And Esther spoke yet again] Having sped so well before, she is encouraged to
speak yet again. Heb. She added to speak before the King. She had a further
request, and having had so free access, and so good success, she takes the
boldness to commence it. We should do so when we come before God. Prayer
should be multiplied like those arrows of deliverance, 2 Kings 13.18. and our
suits reinforced whilst we speak yet again; as Abraham did in his
intercession for Sodom. See, for our encouragement, that fourefold comfortable,
yet again uttered by the Lord, Zech. 1.17.

And fell down at his feet] This was a more humble posture, then yet she had
used: importing her lowly mind and most earnest desire, whereunto she added
tears, those effectual Orators, ( -- Nam lachrymae pondera vocis habent) that
prevail with the hardest hearts many times, and alter the strongest
resolutions. Hereof we have an instance in our Chronicles, which, because it
somewhat suiteth with the case in this text, I will here relate: King Edward
the third laying siege to Callice, they desired parley, and had this final
sentence, that six of the chief Burgesses should be sent to the King,
bareheaded, barefooted, in their shirts, with halters about their necks, the
Keys of the Town and Castle in their hands, and submit themselves to the Kings
will: for the residue he was content to take to mercy. Those came, and the King
commands them presently to be carried to execution, D^. Hist. 240.
and would not on any suit be diverted, in regard, as he said of his oath; till
the Queen, great with child, fell on her knees before him, and with tears
obtained their pardon, and had them given unto her. Nescit Antipater, said
Alexander the great? Knows not Antipater, that one tear of my mother
Olympias, can easily wash off all his accusations of her to me?

To put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite] She does not say to reverse the
bloody decree of the King of Persia, for this might have irritated that waspish
Prince, and made him to have rejected her request as unreasonable, impossible.
She therefore uses a great deal of commendable prudence, ( I wisdom dwell with
prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions, Pro. 8.12.) and picks
out her best time, that she may set her words upon the wheels, as Solomon has
it, Prove. 25.11. and utter right words that may be forcible, Job 6.25. Such
another was Abigail, the woman of Tekoah, and the Matron of Abel. And his
device that he had devised against the Jewes] All the blame is laid upon Haman,
who was indeed a man of wicked devices, and had taken counsel both crafty and
cruel against Gods people. Him therefore she ma^^th the only Author and Actour
in this business, not once mentioning the King, who yet had ratified the
decree, but by his late dealing with Haman, had sufficiently testified his
utter dislike of his own act therein, (...).
and cried, Had I wist!

Verse 4. Then the King held out the golden Scepter] It appears by this, that
she once more put her life in her hand; hazarding it for her peoples safety,
(as Arsinoe interposed her own body, betwixt her children and the murderers
sent to slay them) and so performing her promise made to Mordecai, chap. 4.16.
Gods children are all such as will not lie, Esaias 63.8. if they swear to their
hurt, yet they dare not change, Psalm. 15.4. dare not say and unsay, 2 Cor.
1.18, 19 Of many Promisers it may be said, as Tertullian does of the Peacock,
that they are all in changeable colors: as often changed as moved. Holy Esther
was none such; no more was that blessed Martyr of Jesus Christ, Mr. Hawks,
when in the flames remembering his promise to certain friends, (to give them a
sign whether the rage of the pain were tolerable) he reached up his hands
burning on a light fire, and clapped them over his head three times together, to
the great astonishment of the beholders, but especially of them who understood
the matter. Act. and Mon. 1446.


So Esther arose and stood before the King] Experience had bred confidence.
They likewise that humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, shall be
exalted in due time, 1 Peter 5.6. And as the lower the ebb, the higher will be
the tide; so the lower we descend in humiliation, the higher shall we ascend in
exaltation

Verse 5. And said, If it please the King] See chap. 5.8. Thus when we pray to
God, we must take unto us words, and speak in a low language, as broken men,
The poor speaks supplications, Prove. 19.23.

And the thing seem right before the King] She takes not upon her to
prescribe, but is willing to subscribe to the Kings good pleasure; let us do so
to the only wise God, John 2.3. The mother of Christ does not over-earnestly in
words press him to do that she desired, but only lays open the case, They
have no wine, referring all to his discretion; so ought we in our prayers for
temporal things. Socrates taught his scholars, to ask no more of God but this,
that he would do them good: but how, and how much, they should leave that to
him, as best understanding what is best and fittest for us. Those in the Gospel
that would needs be at a certainty, and bargain with the Master of the vineyard
for a penny a day, when they had their penny, they went grumbling away that it
was but a penny, Mat. 20.11.

And I be pleasing in his eyes] If my beauty please him, which is the best
letter of recommendation to a Prince, as the Queen Mother of France was wont to
say.

Let is be written to reverse the letter] She did not request to rule the whole
Empire for three days, as Semiramis once did; nor to set Persepolis on fire, as
Alexander the great did, at the motion of his Concubine; but that the King her
husband would revoke and rescind the letters of Hamans device, that he would by
new letters correct and overruled (as the Vulgar Latin has it) those former
devised by Haman, that he would antiquate and abolish the plots and projects of
that wicked man. And albeit this request of hers might seem to some, uncivil
and over-bold; yet in a case of such great consequence, wherein the glory of
God, the preservation of his people, and the honor of the King were so much
concerned, she doubts not to present and prosecute it. Hincigitur satis est
conspicua Esterae sancta audacia, Act. and Mon. fol. 1037.
says an Interpreter: such as was also that of Cranmer in the Parliament
house, when the six Articles were in Agitation; and that of George Marquess of
Brandenburg, who professed at the Imperial Diet at Ausborough, Malle se flexis
ibi coram Caesare genibus, spiculatori cervicem foriendam statim praebere,
Sculter. Anual.
that he had rather lose his head presently there in the Presence of the
Emperor, then so yield his assent to the Popish Interim.

Verse 3. For how can I endure to see the evil, etc.] She had her life already
given her at her petition, but unless she might have her people at her
request, who were sold as well as her self, to be destroyed, to be slain, and
to perish, chapt. 7.3, 4. her life would be unto her a joylesse, that is, a
lifelesse life, Mortis enim habet vices quae trahitur vita gemitibus. It is
rather a death then a life that is spent in heaviness and horror. And this
would be Esthers case if her people should be massacred, as was designed and
decreed: Such was her holy sympathy and endeared affection to her Contrymen
and fellow-Citizens of heaven, that she could not live to behold such a sad and
bloody spectacle: Absit ut excisa possim super vivere Troia said Anchises, to
his son Aeneas, that would have saved him life in that common destruction of
his country, Far be it from me to outlive Troy. Curtius tells us, that
Alexander the great, when he was extreme thirsty, and had water offered him, he
would not receive it, Curt. 17.
but put it by with this brave speech, Nec solus bibere sustineo, nec tam
exiguum dividere omnibus possum, There is not enough for all my soldiers to
share with me, and to drink it alone I cannot find in my heart, I will never
do it. Compare herewith this speech of Esther, and you shall find it far the
better, as being full of those precious graces; (whereunto Alexander was a
perfect stranger) humility, prudence, faith, zeal toward God, and ardent love
toward his people. Oh how great is the number of those now adays, (says
Lavater here) qui ne micam Spiritus Estherae habent, who have not the least
parcel of Esthers spirit, but are all for themselves, and for their own
interests!

Or how can I endure to see!] Heb quomodo potero and videbo? How can I? and
shall I see? how should I do otherwise then sink at the sight, (as she did in
the Roman history, when her son was butchered: and as the Virgin Mary felt a
sword at her heart, when she beheld Christ crucified, Luke 2.35.) Melancthon
said, that good Oecolampadius died of grief for the Churches calamities.
Nehemiah was heart-sick for the breaches of Joseph, chap. 2.3. with Amos 6.6.
Moses wished himself expunged, and Paul accursed, rather then it should go ill
with Gods people.

Verse 7. Then the King Ahashuerus said unto Esther, etc.] Here Hamans letters
of Mart are reversed by Ahashuerus, whose answer to Esther is full of
gentleness and sweetness: but yet such as discovers a mind perplexed, and
cast into straits, as Princes eft-soones are by the subtilties and malice of
wicked counselors, Dan. 6.15. so that they cannot do as they would, unless
they will bring all into a combustion; though usually where the word of a King
is, there is power, Eccles. 8.4. and the old Lord Treasurer Burleigh, was wont
to say, that he knew not what an Act of Parliament could not do in England: and
King James in his speech in the Star Chamber, Anno 1616. said as much.

Behold I have given Esther the house of Haman] i. e. I have done somewhat
toward the performance of my Promise made to Esther, chap. 7.2. and more I am
willing to do, only I must observe good order, and do things with discretion.
Behold, I give you, potestatem plenariam and omnimodam, all the power I have,
that therewith you may help your selves, only my former decree I cannot
reverse, but I shall stir up great garboiles in the Kingdom. Josephus indeed
tells us, that Ahashuerus did retract the Edict procured by Haman; and
further, gave power to the Jews, that if any withstood the Kings will herein,
they should kill them, etc. But we are not bound to believe him in all things;
as neither Herodotus, Livy, nor any of the Historians, (the Sacred always
excepted) for Vopiscus, In vita Aure ^^iani.
who was one of them, confesses, nominem historicorum non aliquid esse
mentitum, that there is none of them that has not taken liberty to lie more or
less: and it is manifest, that Josephus his manner is, to recite what he
thinks likely to have been done, and what is fit to be written of such a
business. Baronius annals facit non scribit says one: think the same of
Josephus, he rather makes an history sometimes, then writes it. And therefore
that is but a sorry excuse, that the Papists make for their sacrilegious
forbidding the people to read the Scriptures, when they refer them to
Josephus, as having the History of the Bible more largely and plainly
described. Joh. Barclai. M. Paraenesi.


Because he laid his hands upon the Jewes] He did it because he designed it.
Like as Balak also arose and fought with Israel, Josh. 24.9. and yet the story
says nothing so. But that is in Scripture said to be done, that is intended or
attempted. And this the Heathen also saw by the dim light of nature. Hence
that of Seneca, Fecit quisque quantum voluit. And another says. Quae quia non
licuit, non facit, illa facit. Polybius attributes the death of Antiochus to
his sacrilege, only in his purpose and will. This Josephus thinks could not
be. scil. that a man having a purpose only to sin, should be punished by God
for it. Hence he derideth Polybius for the forecited censure: but he had no
cause so to do, for the Heathens herein exceeded the Pharisees, who hel^
thought free and Josephus was sowred with their leaven.

Verse 8 Write ye also for the Jews] Here was one Syngram or authoritative
writing, crossing another. What could the people think of this, but that
crowns have their cares, and it were a wonder if great persons, in the
multitude of their distractions, should not let fall some incongruities. We
must not think, says Lavater here, if Princes or States command things
different one from another, that it proceeds from lightness of mind; but
that they make Laws, and set forth Edicts according to the state and necessity
of the times, and as the public good requires. In the beginning of Queen
Elizabeth's reign here, (when men's minds differed concerning Religion, and
Reformation could not safely be wrought at once) it was by one and the same
Proclamation commanded, that no man should speak unreverently of the Sacrament
of the Altar, Camd. Eliz. p. 9. Ib. 17 and 20
and both kinds were permitted in the administration. Religion was changed
without commotion by degrees: after that the Romish superstition had stood a
whole month and more, after the death of Queen Mary, as before. The sacrifice
of the Mass was not abolished till half a year after: nor images cast out of
Churches, till two months after that. Here then let St. James his counsel take
place. Be swift to hear, slow to speak; to speak evil of Governors, when they
answer not our expectations, but seem to command contradictories. There are
certain Arcana imperii, secrets of State that most men understand not: and must
therefore dedicate them to victory, as the Romans did that lake, the depth
whereof they could not fathom nor find out. Besides, we must know that there
will be faults so long as there be men, and faults will slip betwixt the best
men's fingers; as Bishop Jewel was wont to say. And as we endure with patience a
barren year if it happen, and unseasonable weather; so must we tolerate the
imperfections of Rulers, and quietly expect either reformation or alteration.

As it likes you] Having been so lately deceived in Haman, and by him
miscarried to the ratifying of that bloody Edict, he will no more trust his own
judgment, but referres the managing of the Jews deliverance. (which now he
greatly desired) to their prudence, discretion and faithfulness. Few Kings
would have yielded to have retracted, lest they should thereby seem light and
inconstant: and confess themselves to have been in an error. Hence, right or
wrong, their laws must stand: and if any demand a reason. Sic vol^, sic jubeo,
must stop his mouth: And Quod ego volo pro Canone sit. Let my will be your
reason and rule, as Constantius said to the Orthodox Bishops, refusing to
communicate with the Arrians. But God who tameth the fiercest creatures, had
for his poor peoples sake brought Ahashuerus to a better bent; so that rather
then contract the stain and sting of such barbarous cruelty, he will run the
hazard of being accounted inconstant: and not care though a Retraxit be entered
against him; as is usually against the Plaintiff, when he comes into the
Court where his plea is, and says he will not proceed.

In the Kings name, ant seal it with the Kings ring] He was well persuaded of
their fidelity, piety and prudence. Otherwise it had been too great weakness
in this Prince, (who had been so lately abused by Haman) to have trusted his
whole power in the hands of strangers. But natural conscience cannot but stoop
to the image of God, wheresoever it meets therewith, and have high thoughts
of such, as Pharaoh had of Joseph. Nebuchadnezzar. of those three Worthies,
Darius of Daniel, etc. Surely, when men see in the Saints that which is above
ordinary, or beyond their expectation, they are afraid of the Name of God which
is called upon by them, Deuteronomy. 28.10. and will entrust them more then any other
whatsoever. It is a Problem in Aristotle, why man is credited more then other
creatures? The answer is, (...) because he alone reverenceth God, therefore you
may trust him; ^ honesty flows from piety.

For the writing which is written in the Kings name, etc.] Therefore you must
not take it amiss, that I reverse not Hamans letters; for I also am under a
Law, (whatever my Predecessor Cambyses held to the contrary,) neither need you
doubt but that what you write in my name, and sign with my seal will be
authentic, and pass for a current countermand, fear it not.

Verse 9. Scu'tet.
Then were the Kings Scribes called] This verse is noted to be the longest in
all the Bible. It was Robert Stevens the Printer (I trow) that first
distinguished the chapters by verses: and this he has done not so well in some
places, as were to be wished. These Scribes were as ready at Mordecai's call,
as before they had been at Hamans; chap. 3.12. neither cared they much what
they wrote, so that they might be sure it was the Kings pleasure they should do
it. As for their Religion, it may seem to be the same with that of Gallio the
Pro-consul, Act 18.17.
a mere irreligion, their Motto, Mihi placet quicquid Regiplacet. Whatsoever
pleases the King shall please me, and if their hearts could be ripped up,
there would be found written therein, The god of this present world.

At that time] So soon as the word was out of the Kings mouth, delay might have
bred danger. Habent aulae suum cito, cito, Courtiers are quick of dispatch, as
they carefully observe their mollissima fandi tempora, so when once they have
got a grant, they lose no time, they know that opportunities are headlong, and
once lost irrecoverable. Hannibal, Plutarch.
when he could have taken Rome would not; when he would, could not. Vincere
scis Hannibal victoria uti nescis, said one to him. Mordecai made use of the
present, the nick of time. Esther could tell him by experience, that a well
chosen season is the greatest advantage of an action, which as it is seldom
found in haste, so it is too often lost in delay. It is not for Mordecai to
drive off any longer, the whole Church was in heaviness, and needed comfort;
and some might be slain, ere notice came to the contrary.

-- Ad opem brevis hora ferenda est. Orid-Metam. l. 4.
In the third moneth] Two months and more the poor Jews lay under the
sentence of death, in a forelorn condition; God loves to help such as are
forsaken of their hopes, to help at a dead lift, to comfort the abject, 2 Cor.
7.6. Though Jacob be a worm, yet God will not crush him, but cherish him. And I
will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, says the
Lord; because they called thee an outcast, saying, This is Zion whom no man
seeks after, Jer. 30.17. The seasonablenesse of Gods mercies does much
commend them. These poor wretches cried, and the Lord heard them, and saved
them out of all their troubles, Psalm. 34.6.

This is the month Sivan] That is, May, when all things are in their prime and
pride, and the earth checkred and entrailed with variety of flowers, and God is
seen to be Magnus in minimis, great in the smallest creatures. Then did the Sun
of righteousness arise to these afflicted exiles, with healing in his wings,
Mal. 4.2. Like as the Sunbeams did to the dry and cold earth, calling out the
herbs and flowers, and healing those deformities that Winter had brought upon
it.

On the three and twentieth day thereof] The precise time is thus noted, not
only to set forth the certainty and truth of the history, but also to let us
see what was the present state of the Church, and what is Gods usual
dispensation and dealing with his people. For two months and more they were in
a very low, and as it might seem a lost condition. Now they have eight months
space of breathing and preparing themselves to their just and lawful defense:
yet are they not without diverse difficulties and discouragements, until God had
given them a full and final victory over their enemies. The Saints prosperity
here, like checker-work, is inter-woven with fears and crosses. They must not
look for a perpetual serenity till they come to heaven. I shall die in my nest,
said Job, I shall never be moved, said David. How apt are the holiest to be
proud and secure, to settle upon their lees, unless God pour them from vessel
to vessel? This the wise God well knows, and therefore exercises them with
interchanges. See the circle that he goes in with his David's, Psalm. 30.5. to
10. and reckon upon this, that if our sorrows be long, they are light, if
sharper the shorter: as thunder the more violent, the less permanent.

Flebile principium melior fortuna sequetur. And it was written according to
all that Mordecai commanded] Had he not been a man of singular parts, he had
not been fit for such a service. It could not otherwise be, but that many eyes
were upon him, and some evil eyes, that would more curiously pry into his
proceedings, then Laban once did into Jacobs stuff. It behooved him therefore
to look to his behavior, and to weigh well his words in dictating such a
ticklish edict as this to the Kings Secretaries. But God who had called him to
this high emploiment, did likewise gift him for it. He was with his mouth, (as
once with Moses, Exodus 4.11.) and taught him what he should say. There is no
mouth into which God cannot put fit words: and how often does he choose the weak
and unwise, to confound the learned and mighty, as he did Balaams Ass, to
convince his Master?

Unto the Jewes] To them first, because they were in their deepest dumps, and
stood in need of comfort; Go tell my disciples and Peter; let him know with the
first that I am risen, for he is in greatest heaviness.

And to the Lieutenants, and the Deputies, etc.] That they might know that the
Kings mind was altered, and that the Jews were now to be favored and
furthered in their just and necessary defense. The equity of this Edict, so
opposite to the former, they were not to dispute but to dispatch. To argue or
debate the business were presumption, proud curiosity to search the reason
thereof, to detrect or disobey, high offense, equal to rebellion.

Unto every Province, according to the writing thereof] In their several
characters, and manner of writing. The China and Japan writing is from the
right hand to the left, but with the lines down the leaf, not crossing, etc.

And unto every people after their language] The whole earth was once of one
language, lip, and speech, Genesis 11.1. This was the Hebrew-tongue, called the
Jews language here, and more plainly, Esa. 36.11. (though some fond men have
given the seniority to other languages, many ages younger then the Hebrew) ever
since the building of Babel languages were confounded, and thereby a great
labor laid upon the sons of men. The Hebrew Doctors say, that thenceforth
for one tongue there were seventy two languages. Others think there were as
many tongues as several kindreds and families; and these have multiplied also
since that time exceedingly. It was Mordecai's care here, that all Nations
under the Persian Dominion, might have the Kings Edict in their several
dialects, that so none might plead ignorance. It should be the Magistrates care
that their people have the Law of God, the holy Scriptures, in a known
language, since the ignorance thereof is destructive to the soul. This the Pope
denies to those misled and muzled souls, that are fast locked up in his dark
dungeon; and gives this bald reason, Ne sacra verba vilescerent, lest those
holy words should be undervalued, and become too cheap. This is good Turcisme:
the Mahometans read their Alcoran, (which is their Bible) in the Arabic
(which is their learned) tongue, lest, if translated it should be profaned by
the vulgar.

Verse 10. And he wrote in the King Ahashuerus name] For he knew that where the
word of a King is, there is power, and who may say unto him, What do thou?
Eccl. 8.4. See Dan. 5,19. Mordecai, as he was careful not to abuse his
authority, so he spares not to improve it to the utmost for the Churches good.
We may also lawfully and comfortably improve the benefits and privileges
granted us by Princes and other Benefactors: Constantines donation and Peter's
patrimony is much boasted of by that Antichrist of Rome. A mere fiction, as
diverse learned men of their own side have proved. Cusanus, Ficinus. Volates
O^ho Frising.
But if it were never so true, what power and Constantine to give away and
alienate such a considerable part of the Empire? (Might he not well have been
therefore called Pupillus, (as he was in scorn by some Heathen Historians for
his bounty to poor Christians?) or with what conscience could the Bishop of
Rome have accepted of such a gift, Lavat in loc.
and left it to his Successors. But it was neither so, nor so. Not Constantine
but Pepin enlarged the Popes territories: as not Peter but Ph^cas, is the right
craggy rock upon which is founded the Popes Supremacy.

And sealed it with the Kings ring] See chap. 3.12. and observe what a strange
turn of things here was all on the sudden. Merlin from this clause gathers,
that the King perused and approved whatsoever the Scribes wrote by the
appointment of Mordecai, he saw it, and signed it.

And sent letters by Posts] Chap. 3.23. That was a witty speech of him, who
said of Sectaries, that pretend much to Scripture; they were like Posts, that
bring truth in their letters, and lies in their mouths. And of another, that
they do angariare, make Posts of the holy Scriptures; Equitantes in equis
angariis Tremel.
compelling them to go two miles, which of themselves would go but one.

And riders on mules] Which are counted swifter then horses, and yet an horse
is so swift a creature, (...).
that the Argives consecrated a horse to the Sun, as the swiftest beast to the
swiftest Planet.

Camels] These were large strong beasts, that could endure long and hard
travel. It is said of them, that they do drink, in praesens and in posterum,
and can hold out traveling three days together without meat.

And young Dromedaries] These were also swift beasts, Jer. 2.23. and therefore
it is by Antiphrasis, that amongst us a slow person is called a Dromedary, Vt
lucus a non lucendo bellum, quasi minime bellum.

Verse 11. Wherein the King granted the Jewes] The slaughter therefore that
they made of their enemies was not unlawful: Because, 1. They were armed with
authority. 2. In their own necessary defense.

To gather themselves together] With till now they might not do, lest it should
seem a riot or rebellion. Conquerours use to disarme and disperse those whom
they have vanquished, ut sit Vna salus victis, nullam spirare sallutem. that
they may not make head and shake off the yoke.

And to stand for their life] Life is a precious mercy, such as all creatures
make much of, from the highest Angel, to the lowest worm. See the sweetness
of it, 1 Kings 20.32. Jer. 39.18. and 45.5. Eccl. 9.4. Job 2.4. Quis vitam non
vult? says Austin. Joseph is yet alive, says Jacob, Genesis 45.26. This was more
joy to him then all his honor. A man is bound to sacrifice all he has to the
service of his life, and to die in the defense of it; to kill another rather
then to be killed by another. If it be the defense of a man's own life which the
King himself attempteth, violently and injuriously to take away, Suar. l. 6. c.
4. sect. 4. Sebast, Huissius.
in such a case ordinarily it shall be lawful for a subject to defend himself,
although the death of the Prince follow thereupon, says Suarez. In the defense
of himself and his friends, it may be lawful for a private person to lay hands
upon his lawful Prince, that sets upon him without cause, says another
Casuist. Only such an act as this must not proceed out of hatred or desire of
revenge, but out of right self-love, and pure necessity; adhibita magna
inculpatae tutelae moderatione, as the Lawyers call it, using great moderation
of harmless defense.

To destroy, and to slay, and to cause to perish] Merdecai makes use of the
self-same terms that Haman had done, chap. 3.13. that all men might know, that
his commission was altogether as large as the others, and that they would, vim
vi repellere; stand upon their guard, slay all such as should seek their lives,
and fight stoutly, pro aris and foris. This, Cic. pro milone
says Tully, is Lex non scripta sed nata; ad quam non docti, sed facti; non
instituti, sed imbuti sumus, etc. that which uncorrupted nature teaches every
man.

Both little ones and women] this seems spoken in terrorem, that the enemy
might forbear to meddle; if not for their own sakes. Yet for their wives and
children, whom many hold more dear to themselves then their own lives. But the
Text may be better read thus. To destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish all
the power of the people and Province that would assault them, their little ones
and women.

And to take the spoil of them for a prey] This also would work much with
those that had estates to lose, For money is the Monarch of this present world;
and many had as live part with their blood as their good.

Verse 12. Upon one day in all the Provinces, etc.] That once fatal day, but
henceforth (the brunt once past) festival. That long-looked-for day, wherein
the enemy hoped to revel in the Churches ruins, to frame Comedies out of her
Tragedies; to wash their feet in her blood, yea, to ride their horses up to the
Saddle-skirts therein, as Farnesius the Popes Champion threatened to do in
Germany; and Minerius in France, and the Papists here in England, at the death
of Queen Elizabeth, and again upon the good success of the Powder Plot, that
great crack and black day, as they called it. For the speeding and furthering
whereof, they had a devilish ditty, consisting of a sevenfold Psalmody, which
secretly they passed from hand to hand with tunes set to be sung for the
cheating up of their wicked hearts with an expectation (as they called it) of
their day of Jubilee. This is one passage therein, Spec. bell. sacr. 20^.
Confirm your hearts with hope, for the day of your Redemption is not far off.
The year of visitation draws to an end, and Jubilation is at hand, etc. The
Psalter is hard to be had, for they are taken up by the Papists, as other books
be that discover their shame. But do what they can, shame shall be the
promotion of fools, (as it was of Haman) but the wise (as Mordecai) shall
inherit glory, Prove. 3.35.

Verse 13. The Copy of the writing] Transcripts of the Original were every
where published and proclaimed, as the contrary Edict had been before, chap.
3.14. This must needs amuse and amaze the people, but who durst say to their
Monarch, What do thou? Is it safe to take a Lion by the beard, or a Bear by
the tooth?

That the Jews should be ready against that day] God sometimes takes notice,
(in his vindictive justice,) as of the offending member, Judge. 1.6, 7. Luke
16.24. so of the place where, 1 Kings 21.19. ( Henry the third of France was
stabbed to death in that very chamber, where he had contrived the Massacre of
Paris,) and of the time when mischief should have been acted to prevent and
punish it, as Exodus 15.9, 10. Ladislaus King of Bohemia and Hungary, having
conspired with other Popish Princes, to root out the true Christians in
Bohemia, on such a day, on his marriage-day, was immediately before in the
midst of his great preparations, visited with a pestilent sore in his groine,
whereof within thirty six hours he died. Henry the second King of France, M.
Clarks Examples.
the self-same day that he had purposed to persecute the Church, and burn
certain of his guard whom he had in prison for religion, (at whose execution he
had promised to have been himself in person) in the midst of his triumph, at a
Tourney, was wounded so sore in the head with a spear, by one of his own
subjects, that ere long he died. Act and Mon. 1784.
The Duke of Guise threatened to destroy utterly the Town of Orleans, but was
himself slain that very evening. The Constable of France made a vow, that so
soon as he had taken St. Quintons, he would set upon Geneva: but sped as ill as
Julian the Apostate did, Ib. 19.14.
when going against the Persians, he swore that upon his return he would offer
the blood of Christians. But the Galilaean (as he called Christ in scorn) took
an order with him ere that day came; the Carpenters son had made ready his
coffin, as was foretold him by a Christian, in answer to that bitter jeare.

To avenge themselves on their enemies] This was no private revenge, but
licensed by the chief Magistrates, entrusted by God with the administration of
his Kingdom upon earth, by the exercise of vindictive and remunerative
justice, Romans 13.4. And here, Bonis nocet qui malis parcit. He wrongeth the
good, that punishes not the bad. True it is, that private revenge is utterly
unlawful, unless it be in a man's own necessary defense, where the case is so
sudden, that a man cannot call in the help of the Magistrate, but must either
kill or be killed. Otherwise that of Lactantius holds true, Non minus mali
est injuriam refer quam infer. And that of Seneca, immane verbum est ultio,
Revenge is a cruel word, Manhood some call it, but it is rather doghood. The
manlier any man is, the milder and more merciful, as David, 2 Samuel 1.12. and
Julius Caesar, who when he had Pompey's head presented to him, wept and said,
Non mihi placet, vindicta sed victoria, I seek not revenge but victory. The
Jews here sought not revenge, but safety. If they had been sold for bondmen,
they had borne it in silence and sufferance, the language of the Lamb, dumb
before the Shearer, chap. 7.4.

Verse 14. So the Posts that rode upon mules and camels went out] Thus God
provided that his poor afflicted should be speedily comforted, and assured that
their prayers were accepted; when this good news came flyng toward them, as
on the wings of the wind, over the mountains of Bether, all lets and
impediments. Thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words, says the Angel
to Daniel, chap. 10.12. yea, as these Posts were hastened and pressed on by the
Kings commandment; so was the Angel Gabriel caused to fly swiftly, chap. 9.21.
or as the Hebrew has it, with weariness of flight, to bring the Prophet an
answer to his prayers. Who would not then pray to such a God, as makes his
Angels Spirits, his Ministers a flame of fire to convey seasonable relief to
his poor Suppliants?

Being hastened] Heb. Frighted and headlonged, by a solicitous celerity,
hasting and hurrying for life, as we say; being driven on to a dispatch with
utmost expedition, they threw themselves onward their way, as the second word
here used, imports.

And the decree was given at Shushan the Palace] So had the former decree
against the Jews been, chap. 3.15. the Post also hastened as now. There is no
doubt but many disaffected persons would jeare at this last decree, as
extorteth from the King by the Queens importunity; and would persuade
themselves and others, that the King was of the same mind as before, to have
the Jews rooted out, only to give his wife content he had set forth this
counter-edict, which they would not take notice of. Thus those that are ripe
for ruin harden their own hearts, and hasten their own destruction.

Verse 15. And Mordecai went out from the Presence of the King] Whether he
went, is not set down. It is probable, he either went to Hamans house, the
oversight whereof was committed to him by Esther; or that he went to some other
parts of the City, upon the public emploiment, whereof now he had his hands
full: and therefore all his faculties were in motion, and every motion seemed a
well-guided action, as one says well of Queen Elizabeth, when she first came
to the Crown.

In royal apparel] Suitable to his new condition. This he might lawfully do, no
doubt, as did Joseph, Daniel, Solomon. Generally those that are in Kings houses
are clothed in softs, and go gorgeously. There is indeed a blameworthy excess
herein, Zeph. 1.8. Isa. Athenaeus.
3.18. Alcisthenes his costly cloak, prized at one hundred and twenty talents.
Demetrius King of Macedony his robe of State, which none of his Successors
would wear, propter invidiosam impendii magnificentiam; Her^ds cloth of
silver, which by refraction of the Sunbeams upon it, gave such a splendor,
that the foolish people for that and for his speech, cried him up for a god.
Good Mordecai thought never a whit the better of himself for his gay clothing:
neither did his heart rise with his habit, as the boat does with the water that
carries it. He affects not this change, but rather accepts it: he endures
it rather then desires it. Sheeps-russet would please him every whit as well
as cloth of tissue, but that the King will have it so; and being now the second
man in the Kingdom, he must go accordingly, lest he should be slighted, as
Agesilaus King of Sparta was by the Persians for his over-plain habit. Vestis
virum facit, a man is esteemed as he is arrayed: cultusque concessus atque
magnificus, comely and costly attire adds authority, as Quintilian long since
observed.

And with a great crown of gold,] We read not that Haman had any such. It may
be the King had bestowed it upon Mordecai as a special favor, for having saved
his life, chap. 2. Sure it is, that he gave it him for a better cause, then
Alexander the Great did his crown of one hundred and eighty pounds, provided by
him at a great Supper, and promised to him that should drink most. Mordecai had
his temporal Crown upon far better terms, and yet looked for a more massy one
in heaven, 2 Cor. 4.17. even such a weight of glory, as that if the body were
not by the Power of God upheld, it were impossible it should bear it.

And with a garment of fine linnen] Or of silk, which was anciently sold for
its weight in gold, Plin. l. 19. c. 13. (...). Verb. frequentativum.
as Pliny testifies. This rich glutton is taxed for the too frequent use of
it, Luke 16.19. It was his every days wear, as the Greek word imports.

And purple.] This was also much worn by great ones of old. Dives was daily
clothed with it, and was so far from cloaking his pride, that he proclaimed it
in his cloak. This purple color was made, says Lavater here, of the juice or
blood of a certain shellfish. Now, they say there is no right purple. Perhaps,
when the four Monarchies ceased, purple ceased with them.

And the City of Susan rejoiced and was glad] Time was when they were in
perplexity, chap. 3.5. now in jollity. Then said they among the Heathen, the
Lord has done great things for them: The joyful Jews there by way of Antiphony
answer, The Lord has indeed done great things for us, whereof we are glad,
Psalm. 126.2, 3. Tremelius, Lucebat.
after Aben-Ezra, renders it. And the City of Shushan shone: the Lilly was now
most lovely and lightsom. The word signifies properly hi^^ivit, neighed as an
horse: which he does not but when he is well-pleased. The whole City was well
a paid, but the poor Jews were over-joyed; so that their mouth was filled with
laughter, and their tongue with singing: This is the import of the Metaphor
here used.

Verse 16. The Jews had light and gladnesse] Truly the light is sweat, and a
pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sun, Eccl. 11.7. Such as have
been long shut up in a dark dungeon; as Joseph will surely say so. These Jews
had for two months and more layn buried alive, as it were in heaviness and
horror, they walked in the very vale of the shadow of death, the darkest side
of death, death in its most hideous and horrid representations, stared them in
the face. Luctus ubique pavor, and plurima mortis imago. Virg.
Their Motto at the best was that of the City of Geneva out of Job, Post
tenebras spero lucem, after darkness we have some faint hopes of life. Job 17.
But now it was otherwise with them. Light was risen to these righteous, and
joy to these upright in heart. Judaeis fuit lux and laetitia (or as Tremelius
renders it, illustris laetitia, famous gladness) gaudium and gloria;
unspeakable joy and full of glory, as St. Peter phraseth it, an exuberancy of
spiritual joy and inward comfort, fitter to be believed, then possible to be
discoursed. For we may not think, that the joy and gladness here mentioned,
was no more then that of profane and carnal people, upon the receipt of some
special mercy, or signal deliverance. They rejoice (harlot-like) in the gift,
but not in the Giver; they gnabble upon the shell, but taste not of the kernel.
The joy that these Jews had, was the fruit of fasting and prayer, according to
that of our Savior. Ask, that your joy may be full. Pray that ye may joy. The
fountain of it was the light of Gods loving countenance: it was (...), (as
Josephus has it here) a salvifical light. The matter of it was the happy
change of their late lamentable condition: and this as a pledge of that light
of life eternal. See Psalm. 23.5, 6. the end of it was a testification of their
hearty thankfulness to God, for his unconceivable loving kindness, a breaking
forth into those or the like words of the Psalmist; Blessed be the Lord, who
daily loadeth us with benefits: even the God of our salvation. Selah. He that
is our God is the God of salvation; and unto God the Lord belong the issues
from death, Psalm 68.19, 20.

And gladnesse] Habitual joy, solid and substantial. Creed mihi, res severa
est, gandium verum. Believe me, says Seneca, true joy is a severe and solid
business, that few men are acquainted with; It is indeed the just man's jewel,
such as the stranger may not meddle with, Prove. 14.13. he is flatly forbidden
it, Hos. 9.1. The wicked man's joy is of another alloy, then that of the
righteous. The light of a candle is fed with stinking tallow, but the light of
the Sun has influence from heaven to feed it; and therefore is not so soon
blown out. Like as together with Manna there fell a dew, so together with
temporal mercies and deliverances, there is a secret influence of God to a
spiritual heart, as there was to these good Jews; and thence their so well
rooted gladness: It was such as did not only wet the mouth, but warm the
heart; smooth the brow, but fill the breast; it was more inward, as the
windows of Solomon's Temple were wider within then without. Whereas on the
contrary, the wickeds joy is but in the face only, and not in the heart, 2 Cor.
5.12. it is but the hypocrisy of mirth, like a little counterfeit complexion.
It is but a cold armful, (...).
as Lycophron said of an ill wife; or as L^m^ch's second wives name, was
Zillah, that is, the shadow of a wife, so is this, the shadow of gladness, the
substance is wanting.

And h^nour] Heb. weight, account, esteem. The poor Jews formerly slighted,
were now highly honored: chari and rari, as Esa. 43.4. bright and glorious as
the word signifies, Job 31.26. precious and ponderous, so that their name was
much set by, as 1 Samuel 18.30. This was the Lords own work, for it is he that
gives credit, and fashioneth men's opinions: he, besides wisdom, gave Solomon
honor.

Verse 17. And in every Province, and in every City] Not at Shushan only, where
it began, but thoroughout the whole Empire there was a general joy among the
Jews. For albeit the worst was not yet past with them: but the thirteenth of
Adar is meant still by Hamans abettours to be a bloody day, (and this the Jews
knew well enough, and therefore prepared for the encounter, so that they could
not be without their fears and anxieties,) yet the joy of the Lord was their
strength, Their hopes and prayers were like those of David, Psalm. 138.8. The
Lord will perfect that which concerns us; thy mercy, O Lord, endures for
ever; forsake not the work of thine own hands.

The Jews had joy and gladnesse] Gaudium in re, gaudium in spe; gandium de
possessione, gaudium de promissione; Bern.
gaudium de praesenti exhibitione, gaudium de futura expectatione. The Persians
might revel, but the Jews only rejoiced. See the Note on ver. 16.

A feast and a good day] Convivium and hilaria, a compotation and a merry
meeting, such as the Saints have here, in their foretasts of eternal life,
those sweetmeats of the feast of a good conscience, (so Mr. Latimer called the
assurance of heaven) which they have here, before they come to that full feast
above. This feast and good day here mentioned, was but a preparation unto that
in the following chapter, when the warfare was accomplished, and all fears
removed, and God said, Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, etc.

And many of the people of the Land became Jewes] That is, they were
proselyted, professing the Jewish Religion, and siding with them: some in
sincerity doubtless, and some out of sinisterity, and for self-respects,
because they saw the King favored them, the Queen and Mordecai were altogether
of them and for them, etc. Mobile sic sequitur fortunae lumina vulgus. Ovid.
Trist. l. ^.
So that mixed multitude, Exodus 12.38. moved with miracles, removed out of
Egypt with the Israelites, took hold of the skirts of these Jews, and said, We
will go with you, Zech. 8.23. So in David's days, whilst he dealt prudently
and prospered, so that he became the head of the heathen, a people whom he had
not known offered him their service, and strangers feinedly submitted
themselves unto him, Psalm. 18.43, 44. The like they did in Solomon's days, as
Josephus relates; as also, that the people then were very careful how they
received such Prosperity-Proselytes. So, many strangers followed the captives
returning out of Babylon, under the conduct of Zorobabel: and many heathens
joined themselves to the Christian Congregations, under Constantine the first
Christian Emperor. The Hunnes well-beaten by the Christians, concluded that
their God was the true God, and received the Gospel. Thus, whether it be in
pretense or in truth, (as Saint Paul has it) that people come in, God is
glorified, and his Church amplified, and the Saints therein do rejoice, yea,
and will rejoice, Phil. 1.18.

For the fear of the Jews fell upon them] So that either for love or fear
they conformed to the Jewish way of worship, or at least they forbear to
attempt against them, whom now they looked upon as Heavens darlings. Whether
Ahashuerus himself were drawn by the faith and piety of Esther and Mordecai, to
embrace the true Religion, is not expressed. It is hard for Princes drowned in
delights, to deny themselves, and to yield the obedience of faith. The poor
receive the Gospel, Mat. 11.5. the lesser fishes bite soonest: the Lamb and the
Dove were offered up in sacrifice, not the Lion and the Eagle; Not many mighty,
not many noble are called, 1 Cor. 1.26. That this King was not converted, we
have ground to believe, when as, after this, we read that in his expedition
into Greece, he was angry with mountains, winds, rivers, elements, no
otherwise then as if they had been men, causing the sea to be beaten with three
hundred stripes for battering his bridge of boats, and casting a pair of
fetters into it, to make it know to whom it was subject. Let him be what he
will, God made use of him for the good of his people, and so overawed the
malignant Persians, that they had (very many of them) no mind to meddle.

CHAP. IX. Verse. 1. Now in the twelfth month, etc.]
TThat lucky time, as Haman had deemed it, but was deluded by the devil, (the
Author of all such Arts and lots of divination, Buchole.
to foretell future arbitrary events) qui etsi semel videatur verax, millies est
mendax, and semper fallax; who, if he sometimes hit upon the truth, yet usually
cozeneth those that trust to him; Thus he served Balaam the Sorcerer slain by
the sword of Israel; Craesus taken prisoner by Cyrus: Ahab slain at
Ramoth-Gilead: Julian the Apostate going against the Persians: Walter Earl of
Athol, who murdered his Master James the first King of Scots, in hope to
attain to the Crown. Crowned indeed he was, but not as his witches and
sorcerers had ambiguously insinuated with the Crown of that Realm, Hector.
Boet^.
but with a crown of red hot iron clap't upon his head, being one of the
tortures wherewith he ended at once his wicked days and desires. The Pope to
honor and encourage the Leaguers in France, sent them consecrated pictures and
medals! promising them thereby good success against the Huguenots, but God
confuted and defeated them all: as he did likewise Tyrone in Ireland, to whom,
Carlt. Rem.
among other trinkets, the Pope had sent a Plume of Phoenix feathers; a mere
collusion.

When the Kings commandment and decree drew near, etc.] Both that for the
Jews, and the other against them. This latter was not reversed, though the
former were published. The King, it seems, greatly cared not for the lives of
his subjects; since he would not so much as privately hint to them to be quiet,
and to let the Jews alone: Such an intimation as this might have saved the
lives of seventy five thousand of them. But God had an holy hand in it, for the
just punishment of those blood-thirsty Persians, confident in the good success
of their sorceries; having made hell their refuge, but it failed them.

In thy day, that the enemies of the Jews hoped, etc.] But their hope ran
astope, as they say; their lucky day deceived them. Wicked men's hope, when they
most need it, will be as the giving up of the ghost, and that's but cold
comfort, Job. 11. ult. and as the spiders web, Job 18.13, 14. who gets to the
top of the window, as high as she can, and then when she falls she falls to the
bottom, for nothing stays her. From such high hopes fell our English Papists,
first, Act. and Mon. fol. 1871
when Queen Mary died* You hope and hope (said Dale the Promoter to Julian
Lining, whom he had apprehended) but your hope shall end in a rope; for though
the Queen fail, she that you hope for shall never come at it: for there is my
Lord Cardinals grace, and many more between her and it. Secondly, at Queen
Elizabeth's death, that long-look'd-for day, as they called it, triumphing
before the victory, and selling the hide before they had taken the beast. This
they had done before in eighty eight, when in assurance of victory, they had
styled their forces the Invincible Armado: and also afterward at the
Powder Plot, when they had presumptuously disposed of the chief offices, holds
and revenues of the land; like as before the Pharsalian field was fought, the
Pompeians were in such miserable security, that some of them contended for the
Priesthood, which was Caesar's office: Heyl. Geo^. 407.
others disposed of the Consulships and Offices in Rome: So at the batte^ of
Agin^court in France, where our Henry the fifth won the day, the French were so
confident of a victory, that they sent to King Henry, Speed. 745.
to know what ransom he would give. A presumptuous confidence goes commonly
bleeding home, when an humble fear returns in triumph.

Though it was turned to the contrary] By a sweet and gracious Providence of
God, whose glory it is to help at a pinch, to alter the Scene all on the
sudden, to begin where we have given over, and to cause a strange turn of
things, according to that of the Psalmist; God shall send from heaven and save
me (when it might seem to some that salvation it self could not save me) he
shall send forth his mercy and his truth, Psalm. 57.3. and then what should
hinder the Churches happiness.

That the Jews had rule over them that hated them] They dominered over their
enemies as so many Sultans. So true is that of the Preacher, Man knows not
his time: (...).
but as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are
caught in the snare, so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
falls suddenly upon them, Eccl. 9.12. Security is the certain usher of
destruction, and God delights, by turning the scale, to retaliate, as he did
upon the Egyptians at the red sea; the Philistines at Mizpeh: these Hamanists,
and our powder-Papists. See. Psalm. 7.16.

Verse 2. The Jews gathered themselves together] They were laeti in Domino,
sed non securi, as Bernard has it. They had prayed, but yet provided for the
thirteenth of Adar, which by many was meant still to be a bloody day,
notwithstanding the known favor of the King, and the patronage of Mordecai.
The Hamanists would join together to perform that sentence, whereof the Author
repented and had rued it. (That old enmity, Genesis 3.15. will never out of the
Serpents seed,) the Jews therefore well and wisely get together, and unite
their forces, that they may make a powerful resistance. They are noted by
Tacitus to be a nation at great unity amongst themselves; and to hate all
others. On of the main scandals they do at this day take from Christians, is,
their dissension, Camer. med. histor. cent. 2. c. 23.
that mother of dissolution, as Nazianzen calls it. The Turks pray to God to
keep us still at variance, and say that their fingers shall sooner be all of
one length* then we be of one mind. What a shame's this? If nothing else will,
yet our common misery, and the hatred of our enemies should unite us, as it did
these exiles, and it was foretold by Jeremy, chap. 50.4. that Judah and Israel,
that could not agree at other times yet when they should be both in a weeping
condition, they should better agree. So did Basil and Eusebius against the
Arrians: Ridley and Hooper against the Papists, etc. And it is high time for us
now to set aside our private emulat^ons and exceptions; as the creatures in the
Ark laid by their Antipathies within, because of the common danger of an
inundation without.

To lay hand on such as sought their hurt] To repel force with force, to kill
and spoil those that sought to do so to them. This, nature prompted them to,
(as was forenoted) and they had also the Kings warrant for it, and they kept
themselves within compass thereof, by not meddling with any, but only those
that molested them. See, chap. 8.11.

And no man could withstand them] Tantum potest bona causa bonis usa consiliis
and mediis, says an Interpreter here. A good cause, a good conscience, and a
good courage, what cannot these three do where they meet? How should any stand
before those who are Deo armati, Ephesians. 610.
strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might? Pilates wife could warn
him of meddling with such: and Hamans wife could tell him, that a Jew might fall
before a Persian, and get up again and prevail. But if a Persian, or whosoever
of the Gentiles begin to fall before a Jew, he can neither stand nor rise,
chap. 6.13. There is an invisible hand af Omnipotency, that strikes in for his
own; and confounds their opposites.

For the fear of them fell upon all the people] This was the work, not of some
Pan Deus Arcadiae, (as the Heathens fancied;) but of God the sole giver of
victory, who when he pleases affrighteth the Churches enemies, as he promises
to do in many places. See Exodus 23.27. Deuteronomy. 11.2, 5. Jer. 46, etc. And as
accordingly he did it on the Egyptians, Midianites, Bapt. Egnat. l. 3
Philistines, Syrians, etc. And the like he did for Baldwin King of Jerusalem
against the great Calyph; for the Hussites against all the force of Germany;
for the Angrognians against the Popes army that came against them. The
soldiers told their Captains, they were so astonished they could not strike,
and that the Ministers with their prayers, Act. and Mon 883.
conjured and bewitched them. So at the siege of Mountabone, whenever the
people of God began to sing a Psalm, (as they usually did before their
sallying forth) the enemies coming, acquainted with their practice, would so
quake and tremble, Spec. bell. sacr. 282.
crying, they come, they come, as though the wrath of God had been breaking out
upon them. What was this handful of captives to the whole Persian Empire, that
they should now become no less formidable to them, Herodo^us.
then not long after those few Grecians were to this Ahashuerus or Xerxes? who
having covered the seas with his ships, and with a world of men passed over
into Greece, was afterward himself alone, in a small Fisher-boat glad to get
back into Asia, to save his own life.

Verse 3. And all the Rulers of the Provinces -- helped the Jewes] Heb. gave
them a lift, sc. over the brook, the brake, or whatsoever lay in their way of
deliverance. This they did out of their respect to the King, rather then for
any great good will to the Jews, who were generally hated for their Religion,
and wished out of the world. Sit divus modo non sit vivus, said that Roman
Emperor of his brother, whom he maliciously murdered,

Because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them] But much more, because God
himself overawed them, and dispirited them. (See the Note on verse 2.) How
else should he appear to be the God of the spirits of all flesh; Exodus 8.11.
and that in the thing wherein people deal proudly, he is above them? How
should they come to know themselves to be but men, Psalm 9.20. and not God; and
their horses flesh; and not spirit, etc. Isa. 31.3. if he did not other whiles
make their hearts heartlesse, Hos. 7.11. their hands feeble, Jer. 6.24. Isa.
13.7. Ezekiel. 21.7. their eyes fane. Deuteronomy. 28.26. their knees knock together as
Belshazzars did, Dan. 5.6. How else would they ever be brought to bring
Presents unto him that ought to be feared. Psalm. 76.7, 8. and to say unto him,
Lord be not thou a terror to me, etc. Jer. 17.17? If Mordecai be feared, it is
because God has put a Majesty upon him, and made him dreadful, as Abraham
likewise was to Abimelech, Genesis 21.22, 23. David to Saul, 1 Samuel 18.29. the
Baptist to Herod, our Savior to the Pharisees, Mar. 11.18. Paul and Silas to
their Persecutours. Acts 16.27, etc. And this the Lord still does, that he may
dwell upon earth, Psalm. 68.18. scil. in his faithful worshippers, which wicked
men would not suffer, if not thus rein'd in and restrained* And (2ly,) that
praise may wait for him in Zion, and unto him may the vow be performed, Psalm.
65.1.

Verse 4. For Mordecai was great in the Kings house] So great a Favorite, as
that it was dangerous to displease him: and most men coveted his favor. It was
now in the Court and Kingdom of Persia, as it was once at Rome when Sejanus
ruled the roast under Tiberius. Vt qnisque Sejano intimus, ita ad Caesaris
amicitiam validus. Contra quibus infensus esset me^^, and sordibus
conflictabantur. His friends were Caesar's friends, Tacit.
and his enemies were in a very low and lamentable condition.

And his fame went throughout all the Provinces] Auditio ejus, the report of
him went far and near. Per ora hominum volitabat, so the Vulgar Latin. He
was Claros inter habens nomina clara viros. It was every where discoursed, that
Mordecai was the Kings Darling, Kinsman, Counselor, that he had saved the
Kings life, and was therefore promoted to the highest dignity: that it were
good getting in with him, who both could and would reciprocate and remunerate
any that should well deserve of him and his people. How thankful the Lord
Cromwell was to those that had done him any courtesy. See Act. and Mon. fol.
1083. How ungrateful Bishop Bonner was to the same Lord Cromwell, who had been
his great Patron, railing at him as the rankest heretic that ever lived, etc.
See in fol. 1087. but this was after his death. Leoni mortuo vel mus insultat.

For this man Mordecai] Vir ille insignis, though he were but novus homo and
peregrinis, a new-raised man, a stranger, and one that had brought in a strange
alteration of things in the Court and Commonwealth: and therefore could not
but be much envied and maligned, as far as men durst show themselves against
him; yet

He waxed greater and greater] Heb he was going (that is, growing) and
greatening. See the like Hebraisme. Prove. 4.18. Genesis 8.5. For why? Difficilimum
inter mortales.
he did gloria invidiam vincere, overtop, envy, and dazzle her eyes with his
luster; which, says Sallust, is the hardest thing that can be. For as the
tallest trees are weakest at the tops: so does envy always aim at the highest.
But maugre malice it self, Mordecai was in the number of those few that lived
and died with glory, gotten by his piety, zeal, and other virtues: neither had
his adversaries any thing to complain of him more then his greatness, Camd.
Eliz. fol. 532.
as Camden says of the old Earl of Essex.

Verse 5. Thus the Jews smote all their enemies] It was the Lords work, 1 Samuel
^5.
and therefore to do it negligently, to keep back their swords from blood, had
been to incur that curse, Jer. 48.10. as Saul did in sparing Agag; Ahab in
showing mercy to Benhadad, 1 Kings ^0.4^.
whom God had destined to destruction. These Jews, as so many Justicers,
Immedicabile vulnu^ ense r^cidendum^^^
were set up by God to do to death these desperate enemies; and since there was
no hope of curing, to fall to cutting, that others might hear and ^eare, and
do no more so, but see and say with the Psalmist, Verily there is a reward for
the righteous; verily there is a God that judges in the earth.

With the strokes of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction] Here then we
see what punishments they deserve that are enemies to the Church, and sooner or
later they shall be sure of. For as hard weather rotteth not in the a^e, so
neither do the judgments against Persecutors. God himself has against them,
and will surely have his penniworths of them: his hand that is lifted up in
threatening, Isa. 26.11. will not fail to fall down in punishing; and the
higher it is lifted, the heavier it shall fall. Subito tollitur qui diu
toleratur: They shall fall by the sword, they shall be a portion for foxes,
Psalm. 63.10. The Spoiler shall be spoiled, Esa. 33.1. and he that kills with
the sword, must be killed with the sword, Rev. 13.10. See, 2 Thessalonians. 1.6.

And did what they would unto those that hated them] Where it is to be hoped,
that they furbished the sword of justice with the oil of mercy; that they
remembered that of the Philosopher, Posse and nolle nobile est, that in some
cases a man must not do all that he may do: as there be some again, wherein
severity ought to cast the scale. The Turks severity I can by no means like,
that will rather cut off two innocent persons, then let one guilty man go free.
Zenecat. obs. polit.
Nor that of the Venetians, who punish with death such as cozen the State of
but one penny, if it be proved against them. Again, care must be taken that
justice be not executed (whether in a civil or military way) with a vindictive
mind, but all selfish actions carefully strained out. Private revenge leaves
a stain upon a man some ways innocent, witness Jehu; and puts an innocence
upon the greatest offendour, witness Abner.

Verse 6. And in Shushan the Palace] One would wonder that any here should
offer to stir against the Jews, so much favored by the King, patronized by
Mordecai, and well-appointed to withstand them. But they were mad with malice
against Gods people, and ambitious of their own destruction. Hamans death still
sticks in their stomachs, and they resolve to be revenged, whatever it stands
them in. With like stoutnesse of stomach it was that Jezabel painted her face,
and tired her head, when Jehu was come to Jezreel, and looking out at a window,
said, Had Zimri peace, etc. Herein certainly she showed her great stoutnesse,
as if she would daunt Jehu, and out-brave him in the midst of his pomp and
triumph, 2 Kings 9.30, 31. Divine vengeance suffers not wicked people to
rest, and to keep in their malice and mischief, but that they must break out
and run headlong, like wild beasts into the hunters toil, or upon the spears
point, whereby they perish.

Verse 7.8, 9. And Parshandatha, and Dulphon, -- and Vajezatha] This Vajezatha
was the youngest, but most malicious of them all against the Jews, as their
Doctors guess and gather from the little Zain, and great Vau, found in his
name.

Verse 10 The ten sons of Haman] Of whom he had so boasted, chap. 5.12. and
bore himself bold, as believing that being so full of children, he should leave
the rest of his substance to his babes, Psalm. 17.14. These ten likely were
ringleaders to those Hamanists in Shushan, (...).
that durst appear in so bad a cause, being evil eggs of an evil bird. Non
enim fieri ullo modo potest, ut ex me and Agrippina vir bonus nascatur, said
Domitius the father of Nero, Dio in Ner.
It cannot be, that of my self and Agrippina, should come any good man. Haman
brought up his sons to bring down his house: and was a Parricide to them
rather then a Parent. His darling Vajezatha he corrected not, but cockered: no
wonder therefore that he proved to be of a gastrill-kinde, (disquieting his own
nest) of a viperous brood; and therefore, though not hanged together with his
father, and the whole family, (as the Apocryphal additions of Esther, chap.
16.18. tell us, but not truly) yet slain in this insurrection at Shushan,
together with the rest of his brethren: the good people crying out as once they
did at Rome, when the son of Maximinus the Emperor was put to death; Ex
pessimo genere ne catulum quidem habendum. Let not one whelp be left of so evil
a litter.

But on the spoil laid they not their hand] Lest the King should be damnified,
or themselves justly taxed of covetousness and cruelty. Give none offense,
neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God, 1 Cor.
10.32. This is often repeated in this chapter, Non semper omnia quae licent sunt
facienda. Lavat.
to their great commendation; that although, by the Kings grant they might have
taken the spoil, chap. 8.11. yet they did it not, 1. To show that they were
Gods Executioners, not thieves and robbers. 2. To gratify the King for his
courtesy toward them, by leaving the spoil wholly to his Treasury. 3. It is
not unlikely, F^vard.
says an Interpreter, that Mordecai and Esther had admonished them how ill
Saul had sped with his spoils of the Amalekites, and Achan with his wedge of
gold, which served but to cleave his body and soul asunder, and his babylonish
garment, which proved to be his winding sheet.

Verse 11. On that day, the number of those that were slain] This was done
happily, by some Malignants, that would thereby have incensed the King against
the Jews. Or else the King (as became a good Shepherd of his people) takes an
account of his slain subjects, by diligent enquiry made thereinto. Whereupon,
he might have repented him, (now in cold blood) of his grant to Esther and the
Jews those foreigners, against his natural subjects, who had done nothing but
by his command, etc. But God so ordered it, that all this notwithstanding the
King was well content with that which was done; as supposing that Hamans sons
and accomplices would be seeking revenge, ^imi^i^ sunt b^ni p^stori^ and boni
regis ope^a. Cy^ 5. ^pud Xenoph.
and plotting mischief, if left alive. He therefore goes merrily into the
Queen, acquainting her with the number of the slain, and giving her leave to
ask of him, whatever more she desired to be done. This was the Lords doing all
along.

Verse 12. And the King said unto Esther the Queen] He would needs be the
messenger himself, as presuming the news would be most welcome to her, whom he
desired to gratify; rather out of affection of love, then desire of justice;
else he would never have so little respected the slaughter of his subjects,
armed by his own command.

What have they done in the rest of the Kings Provinces?] This he should have
uttered with grief and regret; accounting the blood of his subjects dear and
precious; and not making light of so many men's lives lost by his default. But
many Kings make as little reckoning of their subjects lives, as Charles the
ninth did of the Huguenots in the French Massacre; or as the grand Seignior
does of his Asapi, a kind of common soldiers, borne for most part of
Christian Parents, and used by him in his wars, for no other end but to blunt
the swords of his enemies, or to abate the first fury, and thereby to give the
easier victory to his Janissaries and better soldiers; Turk. hist. 317.
This the Turkish Tyrants hold for good policy. How much better that Roman
General, who said, that he had rather save one Citizen, then slay twenty
enemies? and Edward the Confessor, who when his Captains promised, Camd. Rem.
p. 214.
for his sake they would not leave one Dane alive in his land, thought it
better to lead a private and unbloody life, then to be a King by such bloody
butcheries?

Now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee, etc.] An uxorious
Prince, not propitious only to his Queen, but morigerous and obsequious. He was
only her clay and wax; and had she been an Eve, a Jezabel, or an Eudoxia, what
might she not have done with him, or had of him? Our King Edward the third was
wholly possessed and ruled by his Mistress Dame Alice Pierce, an impudent woman,
who so wrought upon the Kings impotencies, that she caused the Speaker of the
Parliament, to be committed to perpetual imprisonment at Nottingham. At length
she grew so insolent, that she intermedled with Courts of Justice, and other
offices, where she her self would sit to effect her desires. But though holy
Esther was none such: yet it behooves Kings to be less Prodigal of their
Promises, and not to leave the lives and estates of their liege subjects, to
the lusts of that weaker sex especially; as having less of discretion, and
more of immoderation.

Verse 13. Then said Esther, If it please the King, etc.] See chap. 5.4, 8.

Let it be granted to the Jews, etc.] The enemies at Shushan could not be all
caught the first day; lest therefore those that lurked should hereafter prove
troublesome to the Church by hatching new plots, she begs, that they also may
receive condign punishment, and Hamans sons be hanged up for an example.
This she requested not out of private and personal spleen to any; but for the
glory of God and the Churches peace. Had her aims been otherwise then good, her
good actions could not have showed her a good woman. For, though a good aim
does not make a bad action good, as we see in Vzzah; yet a bad aim makes a
good action bad; as we see in Jehu. Lavaters note may not here be let slip; the
diligence that Esther used in rooting out her temporal enemies, should quicken
us to do the like to our spiritual, viz. those evil affections, motions and
passions, that war against the soul. These be our Medes and Persians with
whom we must make no truce, but maintain a constant deadly feud, till we have
mastered and mortified them all, Col. 3.5. Romans 8.13. for till that be done
effectually, we must never look to have true peace, either within our selves,
or with others.

And let Hamans ten sons be hanged] Had Haman been now alive, himself by
right should have been their Hangman. There was a young man among the Switzers,
that went about to usurp the Government, and alter their free State. Him they
condemned to death, and appointed his father for Executioner, as the cause of
his evil education. But because Haman was hanged before, his sons (though dead)
shall now hang with him. Neither was it cruelty or revenge in Esther, to crave
this of the King, but zeal to God, and fervent love to his people, whose
welfare she sought by all means possible to promote. As for her self, she could
joyfully say of Haman, as David did of Doeg. Lo, this is the man that made not
God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
himself in his wickedness. But I am like a green Olive tree in the House of
God; I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. I will praise thee for
ever, because thou have done it: and I will wait on thy Name, for it is good
before thy Saints, Psalm. 52.7, 8, 9.

Verse 14. And the King commanded it so to be done] He feared not, that
thereupon the people would rise and call him Tyrant to his teeth: as when
Bajazet the second had cast Achmetes Bassa into prison, the Janissaries in an
uproar insolently answered the great Turk, Turk. hist. fol. 444.
that they would by and by teach him, as a drunkard, a beast, and a rascal, to
use his great place and calling with more sobriety and discretion. Ahashuerus
well enough knew his own power, and was therefore the more bold in disposing,
after this manner, of the lives of his subjects; who were ready to say to him
as once Tiberius did to Justinus. Si tu volueris, ego sum; si tu non vis, ego
non sum: I am wholly yours to command.

And the decree was at Shushan] Dictum, concessum, illico factum. The King was
not willing to cross Esther in any thing, says Josephus.

And they hanged Hamans ten sonnes] For greater ignominy and terror to others.
Thus God commanded the heads of the twelve Princes of Israel, to be hanged up
against the Sun, Numb. 25.4. Joshua hanged the King of Ai upon a Gallows until
the evening, chap. 8. and after that the five Kings of the Amorites, chap. 10.
God hanged up Absalom with his own bare hand.

Abslon mart furens pensilis arbore, obit. Verse 15. For the Jews that were
in Shushan] They did not stand to cast perils, or frame excuses, but with
singular courage and constancy went an end with the work, whereunto they saw
themselves to be rightly called by God and man, keeping themselves still within
the compass of the Kings Edict, and so carrying the matter, that those that
were slain, were judged by their own fellow-Citizens to have deservedly
perished.

And slew three hundred men at Shushan] Besides the former five hundred. All
these with Haman their Chieftain, might have lived long in honor and safety,
could they have kept them quiet; But by the just and secret judgment of God,
they kindled a fire with great force, that consumed themselves, according to
that in the Prophet Esaias, chap. 33.10, 11, 12. Now will I rise, says the Lord
of recompenses, now will I be exalted, now will I lift up my self. Ye shall
conceive chafe, ye shall bring forth stubble, your breath as fire shall
devour you, and the people shall be as the burnings of lime, as thorns ^utup
shall they be burnt in the fire.

But on the prey they laid not, etc.] See verse 10.

Verse 16. But the other Jews that were, etc.] Though they were but a Nation
scattered and peeled, a contemptible and feeble folk, lately destined to
destruction; yet by faith they subdue Kingdoms, escape the edge of the sword,
out of weakness become strong, wax valiant in fight, turn to flight whole
Armies of the Aliens, Heb. 11.33, 34. prevail and prosper against all the
malignant power of Persia: Thus were they helped with a little help, (as it is,
Dan. 11.34.) that God might have a great deal of glory, as indeed he had.

Gathered themselves together] United their forces, as verse 2. which whilst
our Ancestors, (the old Britans) did not against the Romans who invaded them;
they were easily and quickly conquered. Et dum pugnabant singuli vincebantur
vniversi, says Tacitus, who was here with his father-in-law Agricola, an
eyewitness of what he writes.

And stood for their lives] Not one whereof was lost in this hot encounter, in
this sharp revenge they took off their avowed enemies. This was even a miracle
of Gods mercy, Who would not fear thee, O King of Nations, etc.

And had rest from their enemies.] Or, That they might have rest from their
enemies; who would not otherwise be quieted, but by the letting out of their
lifeblood: but would make an assault upon the harmelsse Jews, though it were
to die for it: so that upon the matter they were their own deathsmen, besides
the wilful loss of their immortal souls, which our Savior shows, Mat,
16.26. to be a loss, 1. Incomparable. 2. Irreparable.

And slew of their foes seventy and five thousand] Neither was it any dishonor
to them to be God Almighties slaughtermen. Even the good Angels are
Executioners of Gods righteous judgments, as they were at Sodom, in
Sennacheribs army, and often in the Revelation. There cannot be a better or more
noble act then to do justice upon obstinate Malefactors.

But they laid not their hands on the prey] They would not once foul their
fingers therewith. No godly man in Scripture is taxed for covetousness, that
sordid sin. See the Note on verse 10.

Verse 17. On the thirteenth day of the month Adar] On this day they stood for
their lives, that they might rest from their enemies. And accordingly

On the fourteenth day of the same, rested they] i. e. the very next day after
their deliverance; they would not defer it a day longer, but kept an holy rest
with Psalms and sacrifices of praise, ( those calves of their lips) the very
next day, whiles the deliverance was yet fresh, and of recent remembrance. This
they knew well that God expected, Deuteronomy. 23.21. and that he construeth delays
for denials, Hag. 1.2, 4. he gave order that no part of the thank-offering
should be kept unspent till the third day; to teach us to present our praises
when benefits are newly received, which else would soon wax stale and putrify
as fish, I will pay my vows now, now, says David, Psalm. 116.18. Hezekiah
wrote his Song the third day after his recovery: Queen Elizabeth, when exalted
from a prisoner to a Princess, and from misery to Majesty, before she would
suffer her self to be mounted in her charet, to pass from the Tower to
Westminster, Englands Eliz.
she very devoutly lifted up her hands and eyes to heaven, and gave God humble
thanks for that remarkable change and turn of things.

And made it a day of feasting and gladnesse] Exhilarating and chearing up
their good hearts, (that had long layen low) with a more liberal use of the
creatures, that they might the better preach his praises, and speak good of his
name: and that, since they could not offer up unto him other sacrifices
prescribed in the Law, because they were far from the Temple, they might not be
wanting with their sacrifice of thanksgiving, which God prefers before an
ox that has horns and hoofs, says the Psalmist. Words may seem to be but a
poor and slight recompense: but Christ (says Nazianzen) calls himself the
Word; and this was all the fee that he looks for for his cures, Go and tell
what God has done for thee. With these calves of our lips let us cover Gods
Altar; and we shall find, that although he will neither eat the flesh of
bulls, nor drink the blood of goats, yet if we offer unto God thanksgiving, and
pay our vows unto the most High, Psalm. 50.13, 14.
it will be looked upon as our reasonable service, Romans 12.1.

Verse 18. On the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth] What they
could not do on one day, they did it on another. Men must be sedulous and
strenuous in Gods work, doing it with all their might, and redeeming time for
that purpose, Eccl. 9.10.

On both these days they destroyed their enemies] They did their work
thoroughly: Let us do so in slaying our spiritual enemies: not sparing any
Agag, not reserving this Zoar or that Rimmon: but dealing by the whole body of
sin, as the King of Moab did with the King of Edom, Amos 2.1. burn the bones
of it to lime: destroy it not to the halves as Saul, but hew it in pieces
before the Lord, as Samuel. As Joshua destroyed all the Canaanites he could lay
hold on. As Asa spared not his own mother; as Solomon drew Joab from the Altar
to the slaughter; and put to death Adoniah the darling, so must we deal by our
corruptions, ferretting and fetching them out of their lurking holes as these
Jews did, their enemies on the fourteenth day, that had escaped the day
before. Since we must either kill them up all, or be killed by them; for as that
one bastard Abimelech slew all Gideons sons upon one stone; so one lust left
unmortified will undo the soul. And as one sinner, so one sin may destroy much
good, Eccl. 9.18.

And on the fifteenth day of the month they rested] So shall the Saints do
after death, which will be the accomplishment of mortification, for he that is
dead, is freed from sin, Romans 6.7. and filled with joy, Isa. 35.10. The
ransomed of the Lord shall then return and come to Zion with songs, and
everlasting joy upon their heads, they shall obtain joy, and gladness, and
sorrow, and sighing shall flee away.

Verse 19. Therefore the Jews of the villages, etc.] Pagani. This is expounded
in the next words.

that dwelt in the unwalled townes] Such as is the Hague in Holland, that has
two thousand households in it; and chooses rather to be counted the principal
village of Europe, then a lesser City.

Made the fourteenth day, etc.] See verse 17. while the Jews in Shushan were
destroying the remainder of their enemies. (...) 2 Mac. 15.36.
This day was afterward called Mordecai's Holiday.

And of sending portions one to another] See Nehem. 8.10. To the rich they sent
in courtesy; to the poor in charity, and both these to testify their
thankfulness to God for their lives, liberties and estates, so lately and
graciously restored unto them.

Verse 20. And Mordecai wrote these things] He wrote with authority as a
Magistrate (say some) that the Jews should keep these days with greatest
solemnity. He wrote the relation of these things beforementioned, say others,
as the ground of this annual festivitie. Or else it may be meant more
generally, that Mordecai was the Penman of the Holy Ghost, in writing this
whole book of Esther; as was before hinted.

And sent letters unto all the Jews, -- both night and farre] Propinquis and
longinquis, that they might all agree together about the time and manner of
praising God: and so sing the great Hallelujah. See, 2 Cor. 1.11. 2 Chronicles.
20.26, 27, 28. Psalm. 124.1, 2. and 126.1. Psalm. 136. penned for a recorded
public form, to praise God among the multitude, Psalm. 109.20. and in the
great Congregation, Psalm. 22.22, 25. David would go into the presses of people,
and there praise the Lord, Psalm. 116.18, 19. This was to walk worthy of the
Lord, Col. 1.10. This was to make a proportionable return, for we are Gods
soil, and our thanks his crop.

Verse 21. To establish this among them] scil. by a law, that they should
yearly on those two days rest, and repeat among themselves that signal
deliverance, propagating the remembrance of it to all posterity. Mordecai well
knew that eaten bread is soon forgotten, that deliverances are usually but nine
days wonderment, that it is easy and ordinary with people, to rob God and
wrong themselves by their unthankfulness, which forfeiteth former mercies and
forestalleth future, he therefore setleth it upon them, says the text,
statuendo eis ut facerent, he exacteth it of them by virtue of his office.

That they should keep the fourteenth day, and the fifteenth day] Both days,
nam gaudet produci haec sclennitus, as Austin said of the feast of Pentecost,
such a solemnity should be drawn out to the full length, as the silkworm
stretches forth her self, before she spinneth her finest thread. Jehosaphat
and his people showed themselves unsatisfyable in their praises, which they
presented again, and again, 2 Chronicles. 20.26, 27. And good Hezekiah, when he
observed in his subjects such a float of affections at the Passover, and that
they were in so good a frame, took counsel with them to keep other seven days,
and they kept other seven days with gladness, 2 Chronicles. 30.21, 22, 23. See
with what a flood of words holy David pours forth his soul in prayer, Psalm.
145.1. to 8. as if therewith he would even fill up the distance between God and
himself. Sometimes he seems to forget himself in point of praising God; for
he will, like a bird, having got a note, record it over and over, as Psalm. 136.
And in the last Psalm, there are but six verses: yet twelve Hallelujahs. He
concludes, Let every thing that has breath, or, Let every breath praise the
Lord, let it be as the smoke of the Tabernacle, when peace offerings, were
offered, Tam Dei meminisse opus est quam respirare, says Chrysostom, we have
as much need to remember God, as to take breath.

Verse 22. As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies] And
therefore they in thankfulness would consecrate the same as an holy rest unto
the Lord, calling the fourteenth day, Festum sortium minus, the lesser
festivity of lots; and the fifteenth day, Festum sortium majus, the greater
festivity of lots, as Drusius tells us.

And the moneth] They thought the better ever after of the month Adar, that
magnificent month, wherein was that golden day of their deliverance. O
dieculam illam, etc. dexter sane prae laetitia mihi salit oculus, said he. Oh
that joyful day! Oh that the Calendar of my life might be filled with such
festivals!

Which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy] As God remembered poor Joseph,
and turned his fetters into a chain of gold, his rags into robes, his stocks
into a charet, his prison into a Palace, his brown bread and water into manchet
and wine. And as he had turned again the captivity of his people as the streams
in the South, Psalm. 146.4. So here he had made a great alteration, bringing
them from the jaws of death to the joys of a glorious deliverance; turning
their sadness into gladness, their sighing into singing, their musing into
music their tears into triumph, luctum in laetitiam, saccum in sericum,
jejunium in epulum, manuum retortionem in applausum, etc. And this is no new
thing in the Church.

Verse 23. And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun] Which yet they
could not do, unless God gave them an heart to do it. Holy David understood
this, and therefore when he found that heat and height of good affections in
his people, he prayed, O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel our fathers,
keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy
people, and stablish their heart unto thee, 1 Chronicles. 29.18. And when he had at
another time undertook for himself, that if God would deliver him from
blood-guiltinesse, his tongue should sing aloud of Gods righteousness, he
subjoynes (by way of correction, as if he were sensible that he had promised
more then was in his power to perform) O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth
shall show forth thy praise, Psalm. 51.14, 15. The Hebrew, or rather Chaldee
word here rendered Undertook, is of the singular number, to show, that every
particular Jew undertook for himself, and for his posterity to all perpetuity.
And indeed they keep this feast annually to this day, and exceedingly please
themselves in the reading of this history, counting and calling all such
Princes and States as cross them, Hamans, and wishing that they may be able
one day to be avenged of them, as their fathers were of these Persians, etc.

Verse 24. Because Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, etc.] In
detestation of whose wicked plot, the Jews at this day, when at this feast of
Purim, they read the book of Esther in their synagogues, as often as they hear
mention of Haman, Anton. Meraanta. lib. de Jud. cerem.
they do with their fists and hammers beat upon the benches and boards, as if
they did knock upon Hamans head; Lavater says, the Papists in some countries
do the like on Good Friday, when in the reading of the Gospel, mention is made
of Judas the Traitor. But as for Faux, Digby, Piercy, Catesby, and the rest of
that hellish crew of Popish Hamans, treacherous Judasses, these they have
crowned with fresh Encomiasticks, and little less then sainted. Garnet (that
boutefeau) has his picture set among the rest of Rome's Saints, Corn a Lap.
in Apoc. 7.3. Ger. ^. Apol. Cont Jesuet.
in the Jesuits Church at Rome with this Inscription, Voluisse sat est,
Prodigious impudency.

And had cast Pur] But found to his cost, that there is no enchantment against
Jacob, Ut contereret eos.
neither any divination against Israel, but that, according to this time it
should be said of Jacob and Israel, (said by way of wonder at Gods doing on
their behalf) what has God wrought? Numb. 23.23.

To consume them] Heb. to crush them, as a thing crushed to pieces, as the
lesser beasts are crushed by the Lion, or as things are broken with a maule.

Verse 25. But when Esther came] Heb. when she came. This was the subject of
the Jews discourse upon those days, which they spent not in idle chat, but in
telling one another what great things the Lord had done for them: relating all
the particulars. All honorable mention was then made of Esther and Mordecai;
neither was Hamans malice instanced without utmost detestation: (...) Memoria
ejus sicut vinum Libani, say the Jews of those they honor. Bud. Pand. Herod.
l. 2.
So true is that of Solomon, Prove. 10.7. The memory of the just is blessed,
(or, is with praises, as the Septuagint there render it,) but the name of the
wicked shall rot, as does now the name of the Powder-plotters of Bonner,
Gardener, and other Popish Persecutors.

Should return upon his own head] According to Psalm. 7.17. and happily not
without allusion to those Piaculares and Obominales among the Grecians, which
were certain condemned persons, on whose heads they put the public guilt, and
then tumbled them into the sea; or else to those expiatory sacrifices amongst
the Egyptians which were first cursed by them, and then cast into the river, or
sold to the Grecian Merchants: in an apish imitation of the Hebrews scapegoat,
and day of Atonement.

Verse. 26. Wherefore they called these days Purim] Thereby to perpetuate the
memory of that mercy, worthy to be engraven in pillars of marble: This was a
notable name; for it served to in-minde the Jews of all that God had done for
them at this bout: As there is edification in the choice of fit Psalms, 1 Cor.
14.26. so in the imposing of fit names upon persons, things, and times. As the
Christian Sabbath is to good purpose called the Lords day: and those
festivities of Easter and Whitsontide were not so fitly called Pasch, and
Pentecost, as the Feast of the Lords Resurrection, and of the sending of the
Holy Ghost. It should certainly be the constant care of us all, to set up marks
and monuments of Gods great mercies: so to preserve the memory of them, which
else will be moth-eaten* Such as were Abraham's, Jehovah Iireh, Jacobs stone at
Bethel, Moses his Jehovah Nissi, Aarons rod and pot of Manna, Heb. 9.4.
the twelve stones pitched up in Jordan, the names of Gilgal, Ramath-Lehi,
Aben-Ezer; those plates nailed on the Altar, Numb. 16.40. Hereby God shall be
glorified, the Churches enemies convinced, our faith strengthened, our joy in
the Lord heightened, our posterity helped, and Satan prevented, who seeks to
obliterate Gods works of wonder; or at least to alienate them, and translate
them upon himself, as he endeavored to do that famous execution of divine
justice upon Sennacheribs army, Herod. l. 2.
by setting Herodotus a work to tell the world in print, that it was Sethon
King of Egypt, and Priest of Vulcan, who obtained of his god, that Sennacheribs
army coming against Egypt, should be totally routed by reason of an innumerable
company of rats, sent by Vulcan, which gnawed in pieces their bowe-strings,
quivers, bucklers, etc. and so made way for the Egyptians to vanquish them.
Herodotus adds also that in his time there was to be seen the statue of
Sennacherib, holding a rat in his hand in Vulcans Temple, (...).
and uttering these words, Let him that beholds me, learn to fear God. Lo,
the god of this world has his trophies erected, and shall the God of heaven
and earth go without? Oh let us (who have lived in an age of miracles, and seen
the outgoings of God for our good more then ever did any Nation) offer unto
him the ransom of our lives, as they did, Exodus 21.30. and 30.12. in token
that they had and held all in mere courtesy from God. Let us leave some seal,
some pawn of thankfulness for deliverance from so many deaths and dangers.
Otherwise, Heathens will rise up and condemn us. They after a shipwreck would
offer something; after a fit of sickness consecrate something to their gods;
after a victory, set up trophies of triumph, as the Philistines did to their
Dagon, the Romans to their Jupiter Capitolinus, etc.

Therefore for all the words of this letter] In obedience to Mordecai their
godly Magistrate.

And of that which they had seen concerning this matter] And especially of God
made visible all along in it, yea, palpable; so that they might feel him and
find him, Act. 17.27. though his name be not found in all this book.

And which had come unto them] Scil. by report and hearsay, but from such
hands as that they were fully satisfied thereof, as Hamans lot-casting, Esthers
supplicating, the Kings reading the Chronicles, etc.

Verse 27. The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed] See
ver. 23. Here we have a repetition of what was before recited, and this is
usual in holy Scripture, as Genesis 2.1. Exodus 15.19. that things of moment may
take the deeper impression. That of Austin is here to be remembered, Verba
toties inculcata viva sunt, vera sunt, plana sunt, sana sunt. Let Preachers do
thus, and hearers be content to have it so: Nunquam satis dicitur, quod nunquam
satis discitur. To write to you the same things, to me is not grievous, and for
you it is safe, says that great Apostle, Phil. 3.1.

And upon all such as should join themselves unto them] Those Proselytes,
chap, 8 17. or whatever hang-bies.

So as it should not faile] But stand as a law inviolable. And yet that
Octogesimus octavus mirabilis annus, and that never to be forgotten fifth of
November, are with us almost antiquated: little would oue think that God had
ever done anything for us, either by land or by sea, against either fireworks
or waterworks, Vae corpori nostro.

That they would keep these two dayes] Keep them as before, by consecrating a
rest, and feasting before the Lord; not by gourmandizing and profane sports,
nor by running up and down from house to house as whifflers, and wassailers,
L^de^cerem. Iud.
as at this day the Jews manner is, witness Antonius Margarita, a baptized Jew

According to their writing] i.e. Mordecai's order, by themselves subscribed
and ratified.

Verse 28. And that these days should be remembred] That the memory of them
might be kept a foot in the Church to all perpetuity. Nothing is sooner
forgotten then a good turn received. David found himself faulty this way, and
therefore sets the thorn to the breast, Psalm. 103.2. Other holy men kept
catalogues, (see one of Gods own making, Judge. 10.11, 12.) They also had their
(...), or Memorials, as is before noted. The very Heathens, had their triumphal
Arches, Pillars; Trophies, Tables, Histories, Annals, Ephemerides, etc. A soul
shame for us to fall short of them, and not to wish as Job in another case.
Job. 19.23, 24.
Oh that Gods works of wonder for us were now written. Oh that they were
printed in a book, That they were graven with an iron pen, and lead in the rock
for ever. That famous fifth of November especially, Ier. 23.7. This was
written. Nov. 5. 1653.
which drownes in a manner the memory of all former deliverances; as the return
out of Babylon did the departure out of Egypt. This happy day (too too much
slighted, alas, in many places already) should never be put out of the English
Calendar, whiles the Sun courseth about the earth: but be registered for the
generation to come, that the people which shall be created, may praise the
Lord, Psalm. 102.8.

Every family, every Province, and every City] They should all recognize their
late danger, and thereby the better relish their deliverance, as Sampson did
his honey-combe which he found by turning aside to see the lion he had escaped.
Every man was to consider his own share in the public safety, as the people
did at Solomon's Coronation, and to be particularly thankful. This would
fortify his faith, feed his hope, nourish his joy, further his obedience.

Verse 29. Then Esther the Queen, etc.] See chap. 2.15. Mordecai had written
thus before; now for more authority-sake, and to show her forwardness to
further so good a work, Esther joyneth with him, not for a name, or out of an
humor of foolish forth-put ting, but out of an holy zeal for God and a godly
jealousy over her people, lest they should hereafter slight or slack this
service. And indeed the Jews Chronicle (called by them Sedar olam Rabbah)
tells us, that this letter of Esther was not written, Anna sequent con^igit
quod icriptu^ est. Esth. 9.29. Sed. Ol. c. 29.
till a year after Mordecai's first letter: when those days of Purim happily
began to be neglected and intermitted. She might therefore well say as Saint
Peter did afterward. This second Epistle beloved I now write unto you, in both
which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance, 2 ep. 3.1. True grace
in the best heart is like unto a dull sea-coalefire: which if it be not
sometimes righted up, will of it self go out, though there be fuel enough about
it. This good Queen was no less active in her generation, then before had been
Miriam, Deborah, Bathsheba, etc. and after her were Serena the Empress, Sophia
Queen of Bohemia a Hussite, Queen Katherine Parre the Doctoresse, (as her
husband merrily called her sometimes) and that matchless Queen Elizabeth, whose
Sunny days are not to be passed over slightly (says one) without one touch
upon that string, which so many years sounded so sweetly in our ears, without
one sigh breathed forth in her sacred memory. Oh, what an happy time of life,
had that famous light of our Church Mr. William Perkins, who was borne in the
first year of her reign, and died in her last year.

And Mordecai the Jew] These two joined together to add the more force to the
Ordinance.

Wrote with all authority] Heb. with all strength, viz. of spirit, and of
speech, of affection and expression.

To confirm the second letter] Lest, for fear of the friends of such as they
had slain, the Jews should be slack in observing this feast of lots.

Verse 30. And be sent letters to all the Jewes] Tremellius reads it, Which
letters Mordecai sent to all the Jews, scil. as Monitours and Remembrancers.

To the hundred twenty and seven Provinces.]. Among and above the rest, to
Judea, which was one of that number.

With words of peace and truth] i.e. premising words of prosperity and
settlement, says Tremellius, or promising them peaceable enjoyment of the true
Religion, liberty of conscience, rightly so called: Or praying, that they may
follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the
Lord, Heb. 12.14. Or; he sent letters full of courtesy and truth, that is, of
unfeined courtesy, as Vatablus senseth it. For there is a cutthroat
courtesy, such as was that of Joab to Amasa, of Judas to our Savior, of
Julian the Apostate to Basil, when he wrote unto him, but not with words of
peace and truth, (...).

Verse 31. To confirm these days of Purim] That they might by no manner of
means be neglected, but that renewing their resolutions and their reasons for
the same, they might remain constant, and firm, and peremptory in well-doing;
cleaving to God with full purpose of heart, and sitting close unto the Lord
without distraction, 1 Cor. 7.35.

And as they had decreed for themselves] Heb. for th^in souls; for the soul
is the man, and the greatest thing in the least compass, is a good mind in a
man's body.

The matters of the fastings and their cry] Heb. the words of fasting, etc.
that is, the vows they then uttered when they fasted and cried; that if God
would hear and help them, they would not fail to praise him in all best
manner. Now therefore, since the vows of god were upon them, they should by
keeping these days offer unto him thanksgiving, Aben-Ezra.
and pay their vows unto the most High. Some think that the fasting and crying
here mentioned, refers to those in Zechary, chap. 7.5. in remembrance of the
desolation of Jerusalem; that as they fasted then, so they should feast now;
God having fulfilled his promise there made of turning their fasting into
feasting, and added, Therefore love the truth and peace, chap. 8.19. confer
Mordecai's words of peace and truth, supra, verse 30.

Verse 32. And the decree of Esther confirmed, etc.] Dux foemina facti. Money
was coined in the year eighty eight in honor of Queen Elizabeth, with that
Posie inscribed. The like may be here said of Queen Esther, yea, we may add
that in the Gospel, spoken concerning another. Where ever this history shall be
read in all the world, this that she has done, shall be spoken of to her
eternal commendation.

And it was written in the book] Tremellius renders it thus, When therefore
the Edict of Esther had confirmed these things, it was written in this book.
Lyra and others thus. She requested the wise men of that age, that they would
reckon this History for holy Writ. If it be meant of any other public record,
which the Jews then had, it is lost: as are likewise some other pieces which
never were any part of the holy Scriptures: for God by his Providence ever took
care and course, that no one hair of that sacred head should fall to the
ground. That unsound conceit of Pelican here, is by no means to be admitted,
viz. That this latter part of the chapter from verse 25. to the end, came from
the pen of some other man, not guided by the Spirit of God, and that because
here is no mention made of praising God at this feast, or stirring up one
another to trust in him. For we know that all Scripture is of divine
inspiration, and it is to be presumed that those things were done at such
solemnities, though it be not recorded in each particular.

CHAP. X. Verse 1. And the King Ahashuerus laid a tribute, etc,]
AN extraordinary tribute to maintain war against the Grecians, who uniting
together, were then grown potent and formidable. To enable himself therefore
the better against them, Xerxes gathered money, the sinews of war, but lost
the affections of his subjects the joints of peace. He became hereby ill
beloved of all sorts, and far a less King, by striving to be more then he was.
And hence happily one letter of his name is lost here, for the Masurites tell us,
Drus in lo^
that in the ancient Copies he is written, not Ahashuerus, but Ahasres without
a Vau.

And upon the Isles of the sea] Judea was an Isle, Isa. 20.6. (but not of the
sea, for it was part of the Continent) because media inseperabilis unda,
separated from other Countries, and encircled with Gods powerful Protection.
It was, say some, Herod. l. 3.
by Mordecai's means exempted from this great taxation. Herodotus says, that
a Country near unto Arabia was exempted. He means Judea, says Junius,
though he name it not. It may be so. And it may be, says an Interpreter, that
this is here inserted, as being intended only of the reimposing of the tribute,
whereof there was granted a release at Esthers marriage. chap. 2.18. yet it may
be also added, to show how God punished the Nations for their late greedy
gaping after the lives and estates of Gods people.

Verse 2. And all the Acts of his Power and his might] Lyra and Rikelius
observe, that Ahashuerus had all this power and might given him by God, as a
recompense of his courtesy to the Jews, and justice done upon their enemies.
No man serves God for naught. He is a liberal Play Master, Mal. 1.10. See the
Note there.

And the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai] Heb. the Exposition. Many
make large Commentaries upon their own greatness, which a right Exposition
would show to be rather belluine then genuine. Great men are not always wise,
says Elihu, Job 32.9. But Mordecai was a great wise man, every way
accomplished, one of Gods Rabbines, as Daniel calls them, fit to serve any
Prince in the world. There is a spirit in man, a rational soul in an ordinary
man: but the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding, Job 32.8.

Whereunto the King advanced him] Heb. wherewith the King greatned him; wherein
he showed himself a wise and Politic Prince; as did likewise Pharaoh in
advancing Joseph, Darius Daniel, Constantius Chlorus Christian Officers, our
Henry the eighth, the Lord Cromwell, whom he made his Vicar General. Jovianus
the Emperor was wont to wish, that he might govern wise men, and that wise men
might govern him. Justin Martyr praises this sentence of divine Plato.
Commonwealths will then be happy, when either Philosophers reign, or Kings
study Philosophy. Justin. Apol
Jethro's Justitiary must be a wise man, fearing God, etc. Exodus 18. and that
famous maxim of Constantius Chlorus, recorded by Eusebius, is very memorable.
He cannot be faithful to me, that is unfaithful to God, Religion being the
foundation of all true fidelity and loyalty to King and Country.

Are they not written in the book of the Chronicles] These Chronicles of Media
and Persia, if they were now to be had, (as they are not) would far better
acquaint us with the history of those times, then the fragments of them,
collected by Herodotus, Diodorus, Arrianus, Je^stin and Curtius. But better
books then these Chronicles are now wanting to the world: as the Chronicles of
the Kings of Israel and Judah, the Book of the wars of the Lord, the book of
Jasher, Origens Octapla, (the loss which work says a learned man, deplorare
possumus, compensare non possumus, bewail we may, but make up we cannot).
Chrysostom upon Matthew, (when promotions were offered Thomas Aquinas, his
usual answer was, Chrysostomi Commentarium in Matthaeum wallem, I had rather
have Chrysostomes Commentary upon Matthew); and many other precious pieces,
which learned men would gladly buy at as dear a rate, as Plato did those three
books that cost him thirty thousand Florens. That we have the holy Scriptures
so perfect and entire, preserved safe from the injuries of time, and rage of
tyrants, who sought to burn them up and abolish them, is a sweet and singular
Providence: and must be so acknowledged.

Verse 3. For Mordecai the Jew was next unto King Ahashuerus] Proximus a primo,
the Kings second, as 2 Chronicles. 28.11. having the next chief seat to him, as
Josephus expounds it, (...).
and set over all the Princes of that Monarchy; so that he might well cry out
with that noble General Iphicrates, (...), from what mean beginnings to how
great an estate and dignity am I raised! How long he held it is not recorded;
all the days of his life it is likely, for the good and comfort of the Church,
though not without the envy of many of the Courtiers, which he overcame more by
patience then pertinacy.

And great among the Jewes] A kind of King in Jeshurun, as Moses, as great
among them, as if he had been their proper King. There is mention made of one
Mordecai, Ezra 2.2. who was of the first that went up with Zorobabel. Aben-Ezra
says, that this Mordecai was he: and that when he saw that the building of the
City and Temple went not on as was to be wished, he returned again out of Judea
to Shushan, and lived about the Kings Court, being not known to be a Jew, till
Haman was in his greatness; soon after which himself became much greater then
Haman.

And accepted of the multitude of his brethren] He was their Corculum, (as
Scipio:) their darling, Orbis deliciae Melancth, Chron.
as Titus; Mundi Mirabilia, as otho the third Emperor of Germany was called.
Of Mordecai it might be sung, as Cardanus did of our Edward the sixth.

Deliciae saecli and gloria gentis erat. Seeking the wealth of his people]
Far more then his own private profit, glory and dignity, laboring their good
both of soul and body by all means possible, that they might have Gaius's
prosperity, and be as happy as heart could wish.

And speaking peace] He was gentle and courteous to all, not like Polyphemus,
who was Nec visu facilis, nec dictu affabilis ulli.

Now affability and courtesy in high degree easily draws men's minds, as
fair flowers in the Spring do Passengers eyes; Queen Elizabeth for instance,
of whom before. Moreover he spoke good of them, and for them to the King, and
promoted their prosperity to the utmost.

To all his seed] i. e. to all his Countrymen, as if they had been his own
children. And here that sweet Promise of God made to the good figs, was
fulfiled. Jeremy had persuaded Jehoiakim, and many others with him, to yield
themselves up into the hands of the King of Assyria, assuring them, that so
doing they should fare far better then those that stood out. They did so, and
Mordecai among the rest, as some will have it; and now see how well they speed,
see the faithfulness of God in fulfilling his Promises; the reward of the
righteous, the triumph of trust.

Again, to all his seed] That is, posteris suis, so some sense it; he spoke
peace to all his seed, ^olocut^s est ^speritatem ^du Judaeo^^ posterita. Merlin.
that is, prosperity to all the Jews posterity: providing for their future
happiness also, and taking course, that after his death too, the welfare of
the Church might be continued. This was dying David's care, 1 Chronicles 28.1,
2, etc. and Paul's, Acts 20.29. and Peter's, 2 epist. 1.15. and Ambroses, of whom
Theodosius speaking, said, Dilexi virum, I could not but love the man
exceedingly for this, that when he died he was more solicitous of the Churches
then of his own dangers. So was Calvin as is testified in his life. Nay,
Cicero, as he could confidently sing.

O fortunatam natam me consule Romam. So he elswehere professes, that he was
in no less care what the Commonwealth would do when he was dead, then whiles
he was yet alive. Cic. de amici


Soli Deo Gloria in aeternum.

A COMMENTARY OR EXPOSITION Upon the BOOK of JOB.
CHAP. 1. Verse 1. There was a Man]
A Notable man, a man by ad excellency, and with an accent (as it were;) A man
of high degree, as the word Ish signifies Psalm. 49.2. and 62.9. (where it is
opposed to Adam, utpote quem ex meliore luto finxit Titan) a Manly man, Animo
virili praeditus.
every way excellent and eximious: Magnus and admirabilis vir etc. A great and
mavelous man, if it be fit to call him by the name of a man, as Chrysostom
speaks of Babylas the Martyr. Orat. cont. Gentiles.
Basil in his Sermon of the forty Martyrs, calls them the Stars of the World,
and the flowers of the Churches. Chrysostom speaking of those that were
praying for Peter, Act. 12. says that Puriores caelo afflictione facti sunt,
(...). Hom. 55. in Mat. Dam^^hum beminis and miraculum natura, ut de Scaliger^
non nemo dixit.
by their afflictions they were become clearer then the azured sky: and
elsewhere falling into speech of some religious men of his time, he doubts
not, for their holy and heavenly conversation, to style them (...) Angels. That
Job deserved this high title, as well as the best of them, we have here, and
otherwhere, Gods own testimony of him, and this whole book, whereof he is the
principal object, does abundantly prove him an Hero.

In the Land of Vz.] Which, what it was, and where situate, though our Maps
show us not: yet, by the consent of all, it was a country bordering upon Idumea
in part, and part upon Arubia, see Lam. 4.21. Jer. 25.20. (...). Hom. Odys.
Chrysostom testifies that Jobs sepulcher has been showed in Arabia; which
might well have been called Happy, if but for having such an inhabitant,
Ptolemy places the Hussites in Arabia.

Whose name was Job.] It is then a true and real history, that we here have of
him, and not a fiction or a moral parable, as some have believed, see a double
testimony for this, the one Prophetical, Ezekiel, 14.14. the other Apostolical,
Jam. 5.11. and such a well-twined cord is not easily broken. What if poseph^s
make ^^^mention in his History of such a man? it was beside his purpose to
write any thing, but what concerned the Jews. Aristeus in his History of the
Jews makes Joh^ be descended of Esan, and to dwell in Idumea. The Jew-doctors
and some of the Fathers of the Church make him to be that Jobab mentioned Genesis
36.33. True it is, that the words differ much in the Hebrew writing; but for
that, whiles he prospered, he might be called Jo^^b when in distress (which
(...) twelve months, say the Hebrews seven years says Suides) contracted into
Job. See the like, Rath. 1.20. Cox. 17.5. Some make him to be much more
ancient, viz. the same with that Jobab who was the Son of Jockran, the nephew
of Eber, 1 Chronicles. 1.23. and that himself was penman of this book. He does
(...) wish that his words (...) book; and happily he and his (...) in Hexameters
for most part, as Hierome thinks. But that it was by inspiration of God, is
testified not only by the divine Grandeur and Majesty of the style, together
with the intrinsecal excellency and efficacy of the matter; but also by the
concurrent testimony of not a few other Scriptures; sufficiently asserting the
authentity and authority of this Book. The common opinion is, that is was
written by Moses, while he abode as a stranger among the Midianites, for the
comfort of his poor Country men, groaning under the Egyptian servitude: or
else, that this History written at first by Job and his friends in prose, was
afterward by Moses put into verse, and imbelished, Preface to his Paraphrase.
with the most rich ornaments, and the most glittering figures of Poetry. Sure
it is (says Sena^lt) that there is no book in the world, where the manner of
speaking is more noble, the conceits mere generous, the descriptions more rich,
and the comparisons more natural. Sometimes the Author reasons like an
excellent Philosopher, oftentimes like a profound Divine: but alwa^es like an
Orator, and his Eloquence never leaves him.

And that man was pe^^ect] that is, upright (a^ ^t followe^^ next) and sincere,
without guile or gall, a pattern of patience, a standing rule to all ages; and
therefore (in Gods acceptance and account) perfect and entire, wanting
nothing, Jam. 1.4. because in him patience had her perfect work, Tamim de
victimis perfectis and immaculatis dicitur.
as much as mortality would afford. It was but an unsavory speech of him, who
when he was persuaded to be patient as Job was, replied, what tell you me of
Job? Job never had any suites in Chancery; no; but he had far sharper trials;
and if he had been judge in that Court (as he was in his own Country, Chap.
29.12, 17) he would have made as good dispatch there, as ever Sir Th^ma^ M^^r
did, who calling once for the next cause, was answered, That there was none.

And upright,] more resembling Jacob that plain-hearted man, then (...) his
great Grand father. Of the word here used (Jesher) Israel was called Jesh^^^
(...). 22.15. and 33.5, 26. Isai. 44.1. because God requires uprightness,
(which he calls perfection Deuteronomy. Buxtorf.
18.13. and there is a great Tau in the world Tan^^^ to show that an upright
man keeps the whole law from the first to the last len^^^ thereof) and where
he finds it, ^eckoneth J^^her an Ishmaelite, 1 Chronicles. 7.17. is he a very good
Israelite, 2 Samuel 17.25, and Job the Idumea^, a very good Christian, such an
one as Apelles was, Romans 16, approved in Christ.

And one that feared God] with an amicable, not servile fear, such as was that
of those mongrels who seat'd him for his Lions, and are therefore said not to
have feared him, Sic vive cum beminibum, tanquam Deus videat, S^ ^iquere cum
Dec etc. Sam ^emp. 2o. (...)
2 King. 17.32, 33, 34. Job so lived with men, as if God saw him, and so spoke
with God, as if men overheard him. Thence it was, that seldom or never did
any man see him doing, or hear him speaking, but what was good and godly, as
Xenophon says of Socrates: Thence it was, that he never did well, that he
might appear to do so, sed quia aliter facer^ (...) (as Valleius says of Cato)
but because acting by this principle of Gods (...); he could not do otherwise:
for the fear of the Lord is pure, Psalm. 19.9. and men do perfect holiness in
the fear of God. 2 Cor. 7.1.

And eschewed evil.] He must needs do so that fears God, the greatest Good;
since sin is the greatest evil, and stands in full opposition to him. Job
therefore stands in aw, and sins not, he studiously declines evil, as he
would do a serpent in his way, or poison in his meats. And this he did, not in
a land of uprightness, where the fear of God was in (...) profane Esanites, in
the midst of a crocked and corrupt po^^ration; as Noah is the old world, Lot in
Sodom, Joseph in Egypt, Eliah (...) Orient Star shining with fullness of
heavenly light, and fixed in the region of happiness, though seen sometimes in
a Well, in a puddle, in a stinking ditch.

(...) him se^^^ Sons.] This was a main part of his prosperity, to have such a
numerous issue, to build up his house, and to ^eir his estate, though it proved
to be luct^osa foecunditas; as Hierome said Laeta's was, who lived to see her
children buried before her. Jobs children are spoken of before his wealth,
because better valued: and yet after this, fearing God and eschewing evil, to
show (says Ferus) that he was not like the men of these times, who, if they
have many children, will take any evil course to get something for them, and
think it a sufficient plea against works of piety or charity, that they have
many children to provide for. But such should know, that not getting, but
giving, is the way to thrive: neither can men better lay up for their children,
then by laying it out upon the backs and bellies of Gods poor, to whom, he that
gives shall not lack, Prove. 28.27. that is a bargain of Gods own making; this
the righteous knowing, is merciful, and lends, and his seed is blessed, Psalm.
37.26. when the wicked wretches riches perish by evil travel, and he bagetteth
a son, and there is nothing in his hand, Eccles. 5.14. I read of a graceless
son, who after his fathers death, finding his hoard of money and evil-gotten
wealth, cried out, O faithful drudge! and he soon made a hand of it.

And three daughters.] hopeful and towardly; not like those of Augustus Caesar,
whom, for the evil courses they took, he was wont to term them three mattery
impostumes, and ulcerous sores, wishing, that either he had lived a batchelour,
Tres vomicas tria carcinomata. Sueton. Val. Max. Chri. page 308.
or died childlesse: But rather like those of Charles the great, who so pleased
him, that he could not at any time be well without their company, nor find in
his heart to part with them, though it were to be well married.

Verse 3. His substance also] Heb. his Possession or Acquisition, Possessio
maxim pecuaria. Nomen dictum est ab acquirendo. Merc.
that stock and store which he had gotten, and was rightly possessed of,
consisting very much in cattle, great and small, for money was not then in so
great request as now, when it is become the Monarch, and bears the Mastery,
Regi^^ pecu^i^, as he says; In precio precium nunc est, says another. We read
not of Jobs gold, silver, tapestry, rich furniture (says Origin) and other
accoustrements, now much used and valued, but not so of old. Heretofore in this
Island of our^ (says Hollingshead) in a good Farmers house, 'twas rare to find
four pieces of pewter: and it was accounted a great matter, that a Farmer could
show five shillings or a Noble together in silver: and if the good man of the
house had a mattress or flock bed, and a sack of chasse to rest his head on, he
thought himself as well lodged as the Lord of the town etc. Hollingshead
further says, that some old men he knew who told of such times in England, no
longer ago!

Was seven thousand sheep] He had most of that most profitable creature, good
both ad esum, and ad usum; therefore also in sacrifices was no creature so
frequently offered.

And three thousand Camels, and five hundred she asse^,] s^ to carry his
servants, and his baggage, to export and import commodities: for Net vero terra
ferra omnes omnia possunt.

And five hundred yoke of oxen] To plow his ground with, for great men were
an^iently much addicted to husbandry (as Vzziah, 2 Chronicles. 26.10.) which
Socrates called Amaltheae corn^, the horn of plenty ^ and the Romans reckoned,
that corn was with them never so cheap, as when men were fetched from the
plough tail, Plin.
to govern the Commonwealth, quasi gaud^^^t terra (...) vomere, and aratro
triumphali. But now the case is otherwise, as Beza upon this text complains;
that husbandry and (...), are left for the ba^est and simplest men, and for
such as all others might prey upon. And this b^ingeth into my mind, says he,
that which once I saw painted in a table, where the Nobleman had this posie,
By my sword I (...) you all: the Clergyman, By my prayers I preser^^ you all*
the Countryman, I (...) you all. Lastly, the Lawyer, I (...) you all. P^llican
notes here, that Job had no (...) lived lovingly with his neighbors, not
warring upon any: the horse is a warlike (...), prepared for the day of battle.
But Beza notes, that in that (...) they (...) of (...) to bear burdens, and
Asses (...).

And (...)] Great store of servants he had about him, and himself (...)
according to that of the Greek Po^t, (wherewith Luther was so taken, that be
translated it in certain rithmes.)

(...). Some render it, He had very much husbandry; others, he had great doings
in the world; the more was his trouble, (it is not the great cage that makes
the bird sing, and abroad, the sings not on the ground, but when got in the
air, or on the top of trees. So is it with the Saints) and the greater was his
praise, that he could handle his thorns, and not prick his fingers: have so
much to do with the world, and yet not grow worldly minded.

-- Difficile est opibus non^tradere mores.
Et vom tot Cr^^sos viceris, esse Numam.
So that this man was the greatest etc. A King; some say, the first King of
Edom, but that is uncertain; he might be a private man, and yet a very rich man:
such as was Pythias, who was once able to entertain Xerxes and his two millions
of men for three days, and yet died a beggar, and was famished. He was
impoverished by his own folly and prodigality, but Job, by the immediate hand,
and good pleasure of God, for his trial, and for exercise of his patience. This
commends unto us Jobs constancy and magnanimity, which is so much the mo^e
wonderful, by how much this change was not only not self-acquired, but
altogether unexpected; his sun went down suddenly, at high-noon; and when he
doubted least, he was made a mirror of misfortune; as if God and men, heaven
and earth were set against him. In him it appeared, that mor^ality was but the
stage of m^^ability, and that, Omnia sunt homi^^^ (...) filo;
Et subito casu, quae ^^l^ere, r^unt.


Verse 4. And his sons went, and feasted in their houses.] They were of ripe
years: and although unmarried, yet had they their several houses to dwell in.

Verse 5. And (...) of their feasting were gone about,] Such was his holy care
of them, and jealousy over them, that he would defer the work no longer: as
knowing that sin will ran^^e in the conscience, and harden the heart: like
poison in the body, it must be quickly cast up, ere it get to the vitals.

That Job sent and (...) them, Though they were grown up, yet he kept them in
awe, as appears by his command to sanctify themselves against the sacrifice.
Vt se parent and purgent.
So did not Eli, but honored his untoward sons above God, even then when those
lewd losels kicked at his sacrifice, and at his offering which he had commanded
in his habitation. 1 Samuel 2.29. Job knew that he was bound as well to the
preservation, as to the observation of Gods commandments, to see that others
(those especially of his familiarity and family) keep them, as well as himself.
When therefore the circle of days and feasting was finished, he waited not
till the eighth day came, but at the end of the seventh he summoneth all his
children to come before the Lord in holy duties with the best preparations they
could make: to wash their hands in innocence before they compassed Gods Altar;
to repent of their immoderations in mirth, Psalm. 26.6
or whatsoever other guilt they had any way contracted; lest he cast back their
services as dirt upon their faces. The Heathens, by the light of nature, saw
that God was not to be served slightly and slubberingly, The Pythagoreans would
not have men worship by the by, but make it their business, and prepare for it
aforehand. (...)
And Numa Pompilius, second King of Rome, commanded that men should not worship
God for fashion, carelessly, and as doing somewhat else: but freed from all
other cares and cumbers. The Jews had their Preparation and their
fore-preparation to the Passover: and as any man measures to God in
preparation, God will measure to him again in blessing.

And rose up early in the morning] Sanctificat, senate, ditat quoque surgere
mane. The morning is the best time for holy duties; God should have the first
of every thing: then also men are (...) and freest from worldly businesses. The
Phil^stins (...) to do sacrifice to their Dagon, or Triton, as other Heathens
called him. They generally took the top of the morning ( utpote quod (...)) to
offer to, (...) dung-hill-deities, as holding (...) in their Temples, and took
notice of morning-sal^tations. (...) in the morning: So do the Roman Historians
their P^titii and (...), offering to Hercules upon their greatest Altar of all.
Argona^^^ do the like in Apollonius; and the Persian M^^gi were wont to worship
the rising Sun with their early Hymns.

And offered burnt offerings] Whole (...) offerings, not sacrifice only (as
the Greek interpreter has it) nor peace offerings, whereof himself might have
had part; but burnt offerings, that were offered (...) unto God, and that
according to the number of his sons; not one general family sacrifice only; but
for every one, one. It appears then that Job was no penny father, no ^iggard
in Gods service, but lavish^^ (...) out of the bag, and thought all too little
that was laid out that way. So did Solomon in that greatest sacrifice that ever
we read of 1 King. 8.63. and his father David, when, out of his poverty, as he
calls it, he had prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand
talents of gol^, Hist. of the world. part. 2. cap. 17. sect. 9.
and a thousand thousand talents of silver etc. which Sir Walter Raleigh

F^r Job said] viz. in his heart, for God understands the language of the
heart also, Psalm. 130.1 (...).

And cursed God in their hearts] And not blessed God, so Calvin renders it,

and therefore wrong; they have not high and honorable conceptions of him,
answerable to his excellent greatness; but, by base and bald thoughts cast
him, as it were, into a dishonorable mould, and not given him the glory due to
his Name, that holy and reverend Name, Psalm. 111.9. Great and dreadful among
the Heathen, Mal. 1.14. In the Hebrew, it is, And blessed God, for cursed, by
an Euphemismus or Antiphrasis; as when an harlot is called Kedesha, a holy
woman, by contraries. So aurisacra (i. e. execranda) fames. The Hebrews so
abhorred blasphemy against God, as they would not have the sound of it to be
joined to the Name of God, whom they commonly call Baruc-hu, the blessed One.
So they would not take the name of Leven (that prohibited ware) into their
mouths all the time of the feast of the Passover. Elias This^.
So in their common talk they call a Sow dabhar achar, an other thing, because
they were forbidden to eat swines flesh.

Thus did Job continually.] Heb. all the days; that is, in the renewed
seasons: he was not weary of well-doing, but steadfast and unmovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, always renewing his repentance, and faith
in Christ, figured by those sacrifices; for the Ceremonial Law was their Gospel.

Verse 6. Now there was a day] Happily that day wherein Jobs children were
feasting their last. The Rabbines say, the first day of the year, and some say,
the sabbath day; But who told them so? this is to intrude into things which
they have not seen. Col. 2.18. and where of there is neither proof nor profit.
Certain it is, that as God has before all beginnings decreed all things, so he
has set and assigned the times or seasons which he has put in his own power,
Act. 1.7. when every thing shall come to pass as himself has appointed. Now
then, says Beza, the time being come which he prefixed for the actual
accomplishing of that he had decreed concerning Job, he revealed the same to
Satan (being before altogether ignorant thereof) as whom he had appointed to be
the chief instrument in executing this his will and purpose.

The children of God] i.e. the Elect Angels, called Sons of God, here and
elsewhere: not because they are so by eternal generation, as Christ alone; nor
by adoption and regeneration, as the Saints, John 1.12. but by Creation (as
Adam is called the Son of God, Luke 3. ult.) and Resemblance; for they are made
in Gods image, and are like him as his children, both in their substance which
is incorporeal, and in their excellent properties, which are Life and
Immortality, Blessedness and Glory; wherein we shall one day be their
comperes, Luke 20.36.

Came to present themselves] This is spoken in a low language, for our better
apprehension, by allusion to the custom of earthly Princes and their
attendants and officers, coming to give an account, or receive directions. The
Angels are never absent from God. Luke 1.19, but yet employed by him in
governing the world, Ezekiel 1. and guarding the Saints, Heb. 1.14. This the
heathens hammered at, for both Plutarch and Proculus the Platonist say, that
the Angels do (...) travel betwixt heaven and earth, carrying the commands of
God to men, and the desires of men to God. Jussa divina ferentes ad homines,
and hominem vo^^ ad deos.


And Satan came also among them] That old manslayer, (envying Jobs holiness
and happiness, as much as the good Angels rejoiced in it, and promoted it, for
he was seen of Angels of both sorts) would needs make one among those Sons of
God, not without Gods over ruling power; although he regarded not so much Gods
authority, as wanted an opportunity and license to do mischief. In reference to
this history George Marsh Martyr, in a certain letter of his writes thus to
his friend: the servants of God cannot at any time come and stand before God,
that is, lead a godly life, and walk innocently* but Satan comes also among
them: that is the daily accuses finds fault, (...) persecuteth and troubles
the godly etc. Yet unless God do permit him, he can do nothing at all, not so
much as enter into a filthy hog. But we are more of price then many hogs before
God. Acts and Mon. fol. 14 23.


Before the Lord] Or By or Near the Lord. But can Satan come into the presence
of God* Mr. Caryl.
Surely no otherwise says a grave Divine then a blind man can come into the
Sun: he comes into the Sun, and the Sun shines upon him, but he sees not the
Sun. Satan comes so into the presence of God, that (...) of God: he is never so
in the presence of God, as to see God.

Verse 7. And the Lord said unto Satan] either by forming and creating a voice
in the air, as Matthew. 3.17. Job 12.28. or by an inward word, after an
unspeakable manner, manifesting his will, as he willed, to Satan. The School men
have great disputes about the speech of spirits: but this they agree in, that
the intention of one spirit is as plain an expression of his mind by another
spirit (when he has a will that the other should understand it) as the voice
of one man is to another.

Whence come thou?] This the Lord asks not as if he were ignorant; for he
knows all things, and that from eternity, neither is there any creature that is
not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and open before his eyes,
Heb. 4.13. yea, in him all things subsist, Col^^. 1.17. So that there can be no
motion of the creature without his privity: God therefore thus interrogateth
Satan, that he might show himself to be his Judge, and that he might exact a
confession out of his own mouth.

Then Satan answered the Lord] the word signifies, to speak in
witnesse-bearing, Exodus 20, 16

From going to and fro in the earth] He says not, from instigating men to all
manner of wickedness, from ranging up and down as a roaring Lion, to devour
souls, from sinning that sin against the Holy Ghost every moment etc. All this
he cunningly dissembleth, and says in effect, as once Gehezi did, Thy servant
was no where, or for no hurt to any, when as he is never but doing mischief; as
Pliny says of the Scorpion, that there is not one minute wherein it does not
put forth the sting. Is not the hand of Joab in this business? So, is not
Satan in all the sins of the wicked, and in most of the troubles of the godly?
He^ quam furit Satan, and impellis secures homines ad horrenda flagitia etc.
says Luther! O how does Satan range and rage, that he may glut himself with
the blood of souls? In prosperity be makes men lay their hearts too near it,
in adversity to lay it too near their hearts. Upon Job he tried both these
stratagems.

And from walking up and down in it.] A great Peripatetike he is, and he walks
the rounds; for he is yet a prisoner at large, only he has his fetters upon
his heels, Jude 6, and in them he fri^keth up and down, and fetches a circuit
to spy faults, and to take advantages. Mr. Broughto^ read^^th it, from
searching to and fro in the earth etc. Non dormit a^ semper-vigil ille synag^g^
sun Episc^pus, says one, Amama.
he is vigilant and diligent, restlesss and unquiet (...) (whom one calls the
devils Patriarch) could settle no where, but ran up and down as a fugitive and
a vagabond, Genesis 4. It is said Matthew. 12.45. that this unclean spirit walks
in dry places seeking rest and finding none. Not but that dry and wet are all
one with him, but it imports his restlessnesse. See the like Jer. 17.5. to
run to and fro, is the condition and curse of those that are once departed from
God. Take heed br^thre^ (says the Apostle) lest there be in any of (...) evil
heart of unbelief in departing from the living God, and wandering after worldly
vanities. Take heed of giving way to wilful distractions in holy duties. Men's
hearts are often so divided and dissipated, Heb. 3.12.
that if after any duty they should put this question that God does here to
Satan, Whence come that (...) From compassing the earth. etc.

Verse 8. Have then considered my servant Job?] Job then was in Gods account a
considerable person and (...) one as whose praise was not of men, but of God.
Such (...) all godly people, but especially those that are eminent, tall
Christians; full of (...), filled with all knowledge, as those Romans chap.
15.14. men of choice spirits as (...), that walk up and down the world as so
many conquerors 1 John 5.4. then are clothed with the Sun, and tread upon the
Moon, Rev. 12.1. These are men of mark (...) looking after. A man would have
gone us far to have soon Luther, as he in the story, did to see Livy; or as
the Queen of Sheba did to see Sol^mon. A man would fetch such golden sentences
as those he uttered (...) knees from R^me or Jerusalem, says a Reverend man
that writes his life. The tong^ue of the just is at choice silve^, but the
heart of the wicked is little worth, Mr. Sam. Cla^^
Prove. 10.20. Hence Antiochus is called a vile person, De^. 11.21. though a
great Potentate. And the Prophet tells Jor^m that wicked King of Israel, that
but for Jehoshaphats sake (a better man) he would not have looked toward him,
nor have seen him, 2 King. 3.14. Job was a man of weight, and great worth, as
were those precious sons of Zion, Lam. 4.2. Did thou not therefore make a
stand at his door, says God? See thou not how he stands as a
standard bearer? shines as a great light? shows forth in his whole practice
such a power of godliness, as is sufficient either to draw hearts, or to daunt
them? have thou met with such a man in all thy circuit, that can quit himself
so well and wisely in all estates, like as gold is purged in the fire, shines
in the water? see thou not how all his principles, practices, and aims, are
supernal and supernatural?

That there is none like him in the earth] This was an high praise indeed; and
yet no hyperbole: he was a Giant to other good people, who were but dwarfes and
Zanies to him, for growth of grace, and height of holiness. He was the
paragon of his time; and of impatallel piety. As Ahab was a very Non-such for
wickedness, 1 King 21.25. so was Job for goodness. As Hezekiah out-stripped
all the Kings of Judah for his trusting in the Lord 2 King. 18.5 and Josiah for
his integrity, 2 King. 23.25. (...)
and the Centurion for his heroic faith Matthew. 8. and Paul for his plu^ ultra,
Philip. 3. and Ambrose, that in Theodosius his account, he was the only Bishop:
So it was here, Job was above others, as Saul was above the people by the head
and shoulders. As he was the greatest, so the best man of all the children of
the East, not a man came near him, and yet they might be dear to God
nevertheless. But it is with good people, as with Jonathans signal arrows:
two fell short, and but one beyond the mark etc. God has his servants of all
sorts and sizes: and est aliquid prodire tenus etc.

A perfect and an upright man etc.] A tough piece thou find him, I suppose,
and not easily malleable. Thou have been doing at him, I doubt not, but can
do no good on it. Thou have set thine heart upon him, and tried thine utmost
skill to overturn him, but have met with thy match, and been sent away without
thine errand: thou have but beat upon cold Iron: thou have struck fire, but
without tinder; thou have knocked at the door, but there was none within to
open to thee. Thus God speaks, to sting Satan; and (as it were) ^riump^ing
over his and Jobs adversary.

Verse 9. Then Satan answered and said] Satan and his imps will ^ver have
somewhat to say against the clear truth, their wits will better serve them to
elude or withstand it, then their pride and malice will suffer them (...) to
yield and acknowledge it. But what said Austin of the heretics of his time,
Ga^riant illi, nos creda^^^: Let them talk their fill, and think it a great
matter to have the last word, let us hold to our principles, and count it
enough, that with (...), we have good report of all men (or if not so, yet) of
the truth it self, 3 John 12.

Does Job fear God for naught?] q.d. No such matter. Is there not a cause, as
they said once? has he not wages of the best? and are not thy retributions
more then bountiful? he may serve thee well enough for each price and pay as he
daily receives: He may swim well enough, when so held up by the chin. But the
truth is, Job is a mere mercenary, and serves God for line; he serves not
God, but himself upon God: in a word, he is an arrant hypocrite, and a self
seeker, such an one as does in par^bola ovis capras sua^ quarere, pretend piety
to his own worldly respects, and serves God merely out of interest. An (...)
indeed does so; being therein like the Eagle which soreth aloft, not for any
love of heaven; her eye is all the while upon the prey, which by this means
she spieth sooner, and seizes upon better. But how will Satan prove that Job
is an hypocrite, since he cannot possibly know his heart? and did not the
searcher of hearts acquit Job of this soul sin in Satan's hearing, when he
pronounced him perfect and upright etc. How impudent then is this accuser of
the brethren? The best is, that we have an (...) with the Father, who puts by,
and non-suites all Satan's accusations in the Count of heaven, 1 John 3.2. Yea,
though Satan some^imes stand at the right hand of (...) Zech. 3.1. and may seem
to have the better of him: yet here is the comfort, Jesus Christ our Advocate is
also a propitiatum for our s^ns, as it is in the same text. Who then shall say
any thing to the charge of Gods children? Or if any do, what need we care, when
it is God that justifies, and the Saints as vanquishers shall come off as Job
did, with great glory to themselves, and shame to the assailer.

Verse 10. Have not thou made an bedge about him?] or, have thou not trenched
him in, and secured him with thine own bare hand, as in a town of war, or tower
of brass? thou thy self either art the ^^dge, or make it; and that not only
about his person, but about his people, children, servants etc. yea, about his
whole estate, so that there is no coming at him: and this Satan seems to speak
very angrily. See the note on Zech. 2.5.

On every side] per circuitum, circumcirca. The devil could find never a gap,
make never a breach. Oh the safety of a Saint, that goes always under a double
guard, the power of God without him, and the peace of God within him! The Lord
himself is his keeper, the Lord his defense upon his right hand, Psalm. 121.5.
See Psalm 91. How miraculously has Geneva been upheld, a small City environed
with enemies, and barred out from help of other Churches! How well may we sit
and sing, If the Lord had not been on our side, now may England say, if the
Lord had not been on our side, when men (or rather devils in the shape of men)
rose up against us, then had they swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
kindled against us. Psalm. 124.1, ^
They were not our wooden walls that saved us etc. but thy right hand, and
thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou had a favor unto
us, Psalm 44.3. This was a better wall then that about China or Babylon, or
that which David so soon leaped over by the help of his God, Psalm. 18. who is
sic omnibus attent us ut non detentus a singulis, so helpful to the whole
community of his people, as that he neglects not any one that pertains unto
him.

Thou have blessed the work of his hands] so that he has good success in all
his businesses, all things thrive well under his hand; this the devil
stomacked; and, because he could not come at Jobs heart, fed upon his own.
Malice drinks up the most part of its own venom. It pleases the Lord well,
that his people prosper, In Psalm 139.
but the devil cannot endure it. Well might Austin say, Invidia est vitium
diabolicum, envy is a divellish sin, for it transformeth men into so many
breathing devils.

And his substance is increased in the land.] Heb. is broken forth; so that his
house is too little to hold the precious and pleasant riches that are therein;
his grounds cannot contain the increase of his cattle: ruperunt horrea messes.
In fine, there is no end of his wealth.

Verse 11. But put forth thy hand] Make Job feel the weight of it, as good
people usually do more then others; yet not ad exitium, but ad exercitium,
their crosses are not penal, but probational and medicinal. The same holy hand
of God that was put forth to protect and bless Job, shall be put forth to
afflict him. It must needs be therefore done in measure, and in mercy. If he
smite Job, it shall be in the branches only, and not at the root, Isa. 27.8.
for there is a blessing in it; his hand shall not be further put forth to
smite, then to save, Isai. 59.1. Acts 4.31. Psalm 144.7. If Satan or his
instruments over-do, and offer to exceed their commission, he will never endure
it, Zech. 1.15. This Satan knew very well, and therefore motioneth that God
would put forth his hand and touch him; or, Put forth thy hand. I pray thee;
or, Put forth thy hand a little (so some render it) and touch him; that is,
lightly afflict him. Confer Genes. 26.11, 19. and Psalm 105.15.

And touch all that he hath] or touch any thing that he has; so the word Col
is used, Job 8.12. Prove. 1.17. And it is, as if he should say, Lay but some
light loss upon him, and he will show his unsoundnesse; as if but light
weights be hanged on rotten boughs, they will soon break, and as if wooden or
earthen vessels be set empty to the fire, they will quickly crack.

And he will curse thee to thy face] Heb. If he do not curse thee q. d. then I
shall much marvel, or then say, I have no skill in him, if he will not
thereupon bluster and blaspheme thee, and that openly, impudently, boldly, to
thy very face, avowedly, as ^aligula did, when he dared his Jove to a Duel,
with that Hemistick in Homer (...): as Mahomet the Grand Seigniour greatly
grieved with the dishonor and loss he had at Scodra, most horribly brake out
into blasphemous words not fit to be related; as that black mouthed Pope with
his al despito di Dio. Turk. hist. fol. 423. Acts and ^on. 14.17.
They set their mouths against heaven, says the Psalmist, and let fly at God
himself; they howl upwards with the wolf when hunger-bit; they utter their
own harsh voice, as the Parrot when beaten; and like birds of prey that have
been long kept in the dark, are out of measure fierce and furious when once
they come abroad, so are ignorant and graceless persons; But Job was none
such, what ever the devil deemed and averred of him. Pompey when he had lost
the field, might, for want of grace, say that there was a mist overth^^ye of
providence. Brutus, when overcome by his enemy Antony, may say in his rage,
that all things are carried by blind fortune, Dio.
by hap-hazard. Atque deos, atque astra vocat crudelia. -- Those miscreants in
Malachi may say, it is but lost labor to serve the Lord, chap. 3.14. But Satan
suggesting that Job would do any such thing if crossed, did (as one speaks)
either lie knowingly, or at least guess ignorantly.

Verse 12. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he has is in thy
power.] Here God in appearance condescendeth to the devils desires. But we must
know, that Gods end in this large grant, was not to gratify the devil, but to
glorify himself, by making Satan an instrument of his own shame and infamy,
when by all that he could do, Job would not be drawn to think or speak amiss
of God; though Satan left him his wife (who was within his commission) to tempt
him to it: and afterward left him his tongue untouched (when all his body
besides was smitten with fore boiles) as hoping happily, he would have cursed God
therewith.

Only upon himself put not forth thy hand] Meddle not with his outward or
inward man. He would fain have been doing with both, and had done it now, but
for this merciful restriction; which to the devil was (no doubt) a very great
vexation. But how could he help it, otherwise then as horses digest their
choler, by biting on the bridle? The will of the Lord must stand: and Job,
though he shall have his backburden of crosses of all kinds, yet they shall not
be laid upon him all at once, but piecemeal, Acts and Mon. fol. 1579.
and at several times. Fidelis est Deus, says the Apostle (and Father Latimer
died in the flames with those sweet words in his mouth) God is faithful, who
will not suffer us to be tempted above that we are able etc. but will surely
proportion the burden to the back, and the stroke to the strength of them that
shall bear it. See his gracious dealings with the Apostles, at their first
setting forth into the world: and how by degrees he inured them to bear the
Cross of Christ, Acts 2. and 4. and 5. and 12.

So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord] As thinking every hour
two, till he had sped his commission: the devil descended like lightning upon
the earth, to search occasions to ruin Job, and to triumph over his patience,
to touch all that he had, and to touch him to the very quick. This diligence of
the devil in evil-doing, how happy were it, says Mr. Beza, if we could imitate
in doing well? But behold, whilst Christ's enemies watch, and in the night set
themselves in readiness to take him, his chief disciples do not only snort and
sleep, but cannot so much as be awaked in the garden.

Verse 13. And there was a day] A dismal day it proved to Job, a day of trouble
and distress, a day of wastnesse and desolation, a day of darkness and
gloominesse, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as Zeph. 1.15. That subtle
serpent set upon mischief, purposely picketh out such a time to do it, as
wherein such a sad and sudden change was least of all looked for; and then
lays on amain (as if he were wood) with the hail-shot, hell-shot of sharpest
afflictions. He knows well, that as mercies and deliverances, the more
unexpected they are, the more welcome, (as Abraham's receiving his son Isaac
after a sort from the dead: Isreal's eduction out of Egypt, when they were
forsaken of their hopes: Jonah his being drawn out of the belly of hell (as he
phraseth it, chap. 2.2.) so crosses, the more suddenly they befall men, the
more they amate them; and finding weak minds secure, they make them miserable,
leave them desperate.

When his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine] Wherewith, if
their hearts were overcharged (and what more easy? the devil foiled our first
parents by inordnate appetite, and finding it then so successful a weapon, he
makes use of it still) that day might come upon them unawares, Luke 21.34.
That was Satan's drift surely, however it fell out: and so, to destroy body and
soul together. But it is to be hoped, that he was disappointed of his aim; and
that death was sent in have to Jobs children, as an invitant to a better feast:
and that they might do as our Savior did, who being at a feast at Bethany,
fell into a meditation and discourse of his death and b^^^al, John 12.7, 8.
Sure it is, that although the wicked may die firming, and shall die in their
sins, John 5.21 and so be killed with death, as Jezebels children were, Rev.
2.23. Yet Gods children shall not dye before their time, Eccles. 7.17. or till
the best time, till their work is done, Revel. 11.7. No malice of man or devil
can antedate my end a minute (says one), whilst my master both work for me to
do. It is the happiness of a Saint, that he is sure not to die till that time,
when, if he were but rightly informed, he would even desire to die. Happy is
he, that after due preparation is passed through the gates of death, ere he be
aware, as Jobs children were.

Verse 14. And there came a messenger] A sad relater, not a devil in the shape
of a man, as the Rabbines would have it (let that pass for a Jewish fable) but
one of Jobs own servants, or some other eyewitness, to make Job believe,
belike, that as an evil man, he only sought rebellion, since such cruel
messengers were sent against him, Prove. 17.11.

The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding etc.] i.e. We were none of us
either idle, or ill-occupied: but taking pains, and tending our cattle, when
this disaster befell us. Fools, because of their transgression, and because of
their iniquities, are afflicted, Psalm 107.17. they create themselves crosses,
such as must therefore needs come with a sting in them. See Genesis 42.21. But
Jobs servants were honestly employed when plundered and assassined; which
shows, that his losses were not penal, but probationall.

And the asses feeding beside them] Peter Martyr upon the first of Samuel, Com.
in 1 Samuel 12.
wittily applies this text to prelates and non-residents; who, when put in
mind of their duty would usually answer, that they had substitutes and curates
to do their business for them; It^ labor aliorum est, and proventus ipsorum;
So that others took the pains, and they the profit (says he) and as it is in
the book of Job, The axen plow, and the asses feed beside them.

Verse 15. And the Sabeans fell upon them] i.e. Sabai apud poetas molles
vocantur: but Satan set them a work. B^eerw. Enquir 135.
The Arabians a theevish people that lived by rapine and robbery. They are at
this day called Saracens of Sarac to rob; for they keep up their old trade, and
are not all out so good as those Circassians, a ^ind of mongrell-Christians,
who are said to divide their life betwixt sin and devotion; dedicating their
youth to rapine, and their old age to repentance.

Yea, they have slain the servants] Heb. The young men; for (...) etc. (...).
It was happy howsoever, that they were taken away, when in their lawful
^alling, and about their honest employments: Eliah chose to be taken in such a
posture: for he knew the very time: and yet when the charriots of heaven came
to fetch him up, he was going and talking to his Scholar Elisha. The busy
attendance on our holy vocation, is no less pleasing to God, or safe for us to
die upon, then an immediate devotion. Happy is that servant, whom the Master
when he comes, shall find so doing.

And I only am escaped alone to tell thee] For no other cause escaped this one,
this single one, but to add to Jobs affliction. There was no mercy in such a
sparing: It was, that Job might have the ill news brought him suddenly and
certainly. That old man slayer had so contrived it for the greater mischief.

Verse 16. Whiles he was yes speaking] See here we may, that miseries many
times stay not for a mannerly succession to each other; Aliud ex alio malum.
Terent. (...) Acistoph.
but in a rude importunity throng in at once: Fluctus fluctum tr^^^^, one deep
calls to another; and as one shower is unburthened, another is brewed,
Eccles. 12.2. It must not seem strange, but be joyous to Saints when they fall
(or be precipitated, plunged) into diverse ^emptations, Jam. 1.2. For crosses
seldom come single.

There came also another, and said] Before Job could recollect and recover
himself, or take breath: this was a sore trial: It is a mercy that, we have
some lucida intervalla, that the rod of the wicked does not always rest on the
lot of the righteous; that there are any interspiri^, and Halcyons, since here
they must have it, or no where, Rev. 21.4.

The fire of God] This was more terrible then the former; because God seemed to
sight against Job with his own bare hand, by fire from heaven; as once he did
against Sod^^, Be not (...) unto we, O Lord, says Jeremy, chap. 17.17. And
then I care nor though all the world set against me. If Mariners, in a tempest
have sea room enough, their is no fear so if men in afflictions can see and
say, (...); and on the contrary, Heb. 10.
it is fearful to fall into the hands of the living God.

And has (...) up (...)] wherewith Job was wont to offer sacrifice. It was
great joy to those in Joel, that God after a sore and long famine, would yet
leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering etc.
Joel 2.14.

And thy servants.] Those souls of men, as they are called, Rev. 18.13. This
was a worse loss then that of his sheep.

And I only, etc.] See the Note on Verse 15.

Verse 17. While he was yet speaking] See on Verse 16.

The Chald^ans] A base and obscure people from the beginning, subject to the
Assyrians, but yet more potent then the Sabaans, as appears by the three
bands they made out. The Sabaea^s are noted by Strabo to be an idle and
effeminate people. The Chaldeans are set forth in the Scripture to be a bitter
and hasty Nation, terrible and dreadful, fiercer then the evening wolves, etc.
Hab. 1.6, 7, 8. Satan proceeds by degrees to afflict Job, that he may at length
over-turn him: but beyond expectation, he held out all assaults: Instar rupis
qua in mari vadoso horridi Jovu, and irati, ut it a dicam, Neptuni fervidis
assultibus undique verberata non cedit aut minuitur, sed obtendit assuetum
luctibus latus, and firma duritie tumentis unde impetum susti^^^ ac frangit.
J^an. Wower Polymath.


Made out three bands] Which were marshalled and set in array by the Devil, who
was their Commander in chief Sic sape lo^^catus incedit Satan, and
cataphractus, as Luther speaks: he has his Legions among men also, who (like
those vulturine Eagles Job 39.30.) do glut-glut blood, as the Hebrew word there
sounds and signifies.

And fell upon the Camels] Heb. Spread themselves over them, rushed and ran
violently making an impression upon the Camels.

And have carried them away: Heb. Have taken them to themselves, though Job had
never dealt discourteously with these Chaldeans, nor had his Camels trespassed
them, but were carefully kept by the servants. Innocence is no target against
injury; neither does Victory always argue a just Cause.

Yea, and slain the servants, etc.] See the Note on Ver. 15.

Verse 18. While he was yet speaking. See Verse 16.

Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine] This was the last,
but not the least of Satan's assaults, reserved purposely to the last, to crush
him quite, when he was now spent and spiritlesse, as he hoped. Let us look for
like dealing, for a tough bout, at death howsoever: and be always ready
prepared for another and a worse encounter. Seneca.
It is said of Caesar, that he sometimes put up, but seldom or never put off
his Sword. It is said of Qui Elizabeth, that in the greatest calm she provided
for a storm. It is said or the b^rd Onocrotalus, that she if so well practiced
to expect the Hawk to grapple with her, that even when she shuts her eyes,
she sleeps with her beak exalted, as if she would contend with her adversary.
Should not we stand constantly upon our Guard, who have so restless and
pitilesse an enemy?

Thy sons and thy daughters etc.] Men may die then with the meat in their
mouths, and in the midst of their mirth and jollity; as did Amnon, Elah,
Balshazzar. W^ether therefore we eat or drink etc. do all to the glory of God.
1 Cor. 10.31. Let there be holiness to the Lord written upon our pots, Zech
14.21. Let us eat, and drink, and sleep eternal life. as a reverend Scotch
Divine was said to do. Jobs good heart aked and quaked (likely) at the hearing
of this sad news, of so sudden a death of his children, amidst their
merriments: for he used to say, when there was no such danger. It may be, my
sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Me thinks, I hear him saying,
or rather sighing out those sorrowful words of Cratisic^^^ in Pl^tarch, Plut.
in vit. Cleomenis.
when she saw her dear children slain before her, Quo, pueri, est ^^ profecti?
Poor souls, what is become of you? See more on Verse 13.

Verse 19. And behold, there come a great wind] The Devil (doubtless) was in
this wind (as he is by divine permission, the Prince of the power of the air,
Ephesians. 2.2. and can thereby do much mischief) what wonder then though it were a
great wind, since spirited by him, and (...) came on amain, and with a (...),
as being driven on by the Devil It was a wonderful wind (belike a whirlwind)

known before: The Rabbis say, that he was so affrighted with it, that no
sooner had he made an end of his report of it to (...). Sure it is, that he
relates the matter (...) and graphically, with (...), and without that
moderation and making the best of things at first, as in such cases is usual,
when parents are first made acquainted with the sudden death of their children;
or other sad accidents that have befallen the^. This messenger cl^ttereth out
all at once, being thereunto set on, and suborned by Satan (as Lava^er
thinks) to stir up Jobs stomach, and to make him break off that so
well-twisted thread of his patience.

From the wildernesse] of Idumea, or Arabia, called deserta. The devil, who
haunteth dry and desert places, was the Aeolus that sent it. Let us bless that
God (the maker and master of these Meteors, and of all things else) who binds
up such an enemy and boundeth such a power.

And smote the four corners of the house. This was extraordinary, and therefore
the more dreadful: God seeming to fulfill upon Job and his children, what he
threatens in the Law, Deuteronomy. 28.59. I will make their plagues wonderful. But
what says Solomon, and that after long debate with himself about occurrents of
this nature? For all this I considered in mins heart, even to declare all this,
that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no
man knows, either love or hatred, by all that is before them, Eccles. 9.1, 2
by externals we cannot judge aright of eternals. Let it be our care to lay hold
on eternal li^e; and then sudden death can do us no hurt; no guest comes
unawares to him who keeps a constants table.

And it fell upon the young men, and they are dead] No doubt but they were
miserably mawled and dis-membred by the fall, so that they were pulled forth
piecemeale, and it could hardly be known which was which as we say. The like
death befell Scopa^ (a rich and noble man of Th^ssaly) together with his
guests, all oppressed and slain together by the ruin of that room where, they
were feasting, and fearing no such danger, as Tully tells us; Simonides was
at that feast, but was at that instant happily called out by two young men that
came to speak with him, Cic. lib. 2. de Orat^r. Acts and Mon. fol. 78^. Stones
Chron. cont. by Hom* page 130.
Luther had the like deliverance by a special providence, as Mr. Fox relates.
But so had not those Londoners in the Reign of King Willi^^^ the second, who
perished by a terrible tempest, which blew down suddenly six hundred and six
houses in that chief City. No more had those that died by the fall of part of
an house in Blackfriars, where and whiles Dru^^ a Popish Priest was preaching,
who (together with an hundred more Papists his hearers) had there their
pasport; this fell out in the year 1623. And the like we had lately at W^tney
in Oxfordshire, where a scurrilous blasphemous Comedy was by the fall of the
room wherein in was acted, Feb. 3. 1652 turned into a Tragedy, as ending with
the deaths of six, and hurts of about threescore, who were bruised and maimed,
and some (as it were) half dead, carried away by their friends. The narrative
whereof, together with what was preached there in three Sermons on that
occasion from Rom 1.18, is set forth by Mr. John Row (Lecturer in that town)
in his book called Tragicomedia.

Verse 20. Then Job arose and rent his mani^e] He stirred not at the three
first doleful tidings, but this fourth startleth him; for he was neither a
Stoic, nor a stock. His strength was not the ^ir ugth of stones, nor his ^l^sh
of brass, chap 6.12. That he should bear blows, and never feel pain, or make
moan; that he should be silent in darkness, 1 Samuel 2.9. and not cry when God
bound him, Job 36.11. This Stoical apathy or indolency (condemning all
affections in that their wise man, who, as Cicero very well says, as yet was
never found) Jeremiah justly complains of, Jer. 5.3. and the Peripatetickes
utterly disliked; teaching, that wisdom does not remove affections, but only
reduce them to a mediocrity. Job kept the mean between despising the chastening
of the Lord, and fainting when rebuked by him, Heb. 12.5 When Germani^^ died,
diverse foreign Princes shaved their beards, to show their grief. Su^ton,
Legatur Hadr. Jun. com. de com^, cap. 2. and 4. Plut. is Al^^^
See my Livertokens, page 37.38. etc.

And shaved his head] In token of his very great sorrow, see Jer. 7.29. Micah
1.16. Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children, enlarge thy
baldness as the Eagle. See the note there. Plutarch tells us, that Alexander
the great, at the Funeral of Ephesti^n his favorite, not only shaved himself,
but clipped his horses and mu^es hair; yea, he plucked down also the
battlements of the walls of the City, that they might seem to mourn too: but
this savored of too much ^u^^ennesse. How much better his Macedonians, who
being once sensible of his displeasure, laid by their arms, put on their
mourning attire, came ^^^oping to his tent, where for almost three days they
remained with loud cries, and abundance of tears, testifying their remorse for
offending him, beseeching his pardon, which at last they gained. God calls to
baldness for sin, Isa. 22.12. which in other cases was forbidden, Lev. 19.27.
and 21.5. Deuteronomy. 14.1. This Job performed here: for he knew that although God
afflicts sometimes for his own glory, John 9.3. sometimes for trial or
exercise of his peoples graces; yet sin is ever at the bottom as the
meritorious cause of what they suffer; and if he did not duly consider it
before, Zophar gave him to understand that God exacted of him less then his
iniquity had deserved, chap. 11.6.

And fell down upon the ground] This shows that Job arose not before to this
end, that with a stout and stubborn gesture of the body, he might withstand
God: but rather, that he might with greater lowliness and humility submit to
his justice, and implore his mercy: He fell down upon the ground and
worshipped, says the Text; that is, he fell upon the ground to worship. He
fell not all along on the earth, as Saul did, out of despondency and despair,
after that he had heard the devil preaching his funeral, he lay like an ox
on the earth, in the fullness of his stature, as the Original has it, 1 Samuel
28.20. but, as humbling himself under the mighty hand of God, who would raise
him up in due season, 1 Pet. 5.6. and as reverently and religiously submitting
to his will. Mr. Caryl. ex Bolduc in loc.
And it is probably observed (says a late Expositor out of another) that the
ancient Prophets and holy men were called Nephalim procidentes, or Prostrantes,
that is pr^strates or Fallers down, because in their worship they usually fell
down upon the earth, to humble themselves before the Lord.

Verse 21. And said] He lay not on the ground dumb as a stone, as it is said of
Nabal, 1 Samuel 25.37 Herod Hom.
and fained of Niobe. He rages not as Xerxes did, when he beat the Sea by way
of revenge: neither vexes himself without measure, as Achilles at the death of
his friend Patroclus. He curses not God to his face (as Satan that old liar
said he would do) nor so much as the Sabees and Chaldees, or the devil the
chief Enginere of his present sufferings: but rejoicing in hope, patient in
tribulation, continuing instant in prayer he said in the words of truth and
soberness. Romans 12.12.


Naked came I out of my mothers womb.] Hence the Proverb, Nudus tanquam ex
^atre, not having a ragge to my back, but stark naked, as ever I was born.
Hither I came a pitiful poor destitute, shiftlesse and forlorn creature, not
having a cross to bless my self with, as they say: much less, sheep and
oxen, children and servants etc. Psalm. 22.9, 10
howbeit God provided for me then; and as he took me out of the womb, so he
made me to hope when I was upon my mothers breasts. I was cast upon him from
the womb etc. And shall I now cast away my confidence which has so great
recompense of reward? No, though he has stripped me stark-naked, and left me
with as little as he first found me, yet I will trust in him. It is he that
makes poor, and makes rich: he brings low, and lifts up again, 1 Samuel
2.7. The will of the Lord be done. Here I am, let the Lord do with me, that
which is right in his own eyes, 2 Samuel 15.26. He is Lord Paramount, the true
proprietary and Owner of all: I have been only his steward, his tenant at will.

Jamque meos dedo Domino tibijure pena^es:
Tu mihi jus dederas, posse vocare Meos.
And naked shall I return thither again] sc. to the womb of my Magna Paren^,
the earth, Magna paren^ terra est. Ovid.
fitly called a Mother, because as thence we came in Adam, so there-hence shall
we be born again (as it were) at the resurrection; called therefore the
Regeneration, Matthew 19.28. for so some read the words there; Ye which have
followed me, shall in the Regeneration (when the Son of man shall sit in his
glory) sit upon twelve thrones etc. See Psalm. 2.7. with Acts 13.33. This Plato
hammered at in his (...) or great Revolution. To the grave therefore, that womb
of the earth, that Congregation house of all living, as Job elswehere calls
it, chap. 30.23. shall I return, says he; implying that our life is nothing
but a coming and a returning. Repatriasse erit hoc, says Bernard concerning
death. It is but a coming and a going (says a Divine) it is but a flood and an
ebb, and then we are carried into the Ocean of Eternity. I read of one, who
being asked what life was? made an answer answerlesse; for he presently turned
his back, and went his way. The truth is, we fetch here but a turn, and God
says, Return again, Psalm. 90.3. To live, is but to lie a dying: the earth
receives us like a kind mother into her entrails; when we have a while trodden
her underfoot, we haste to our long home, Eccles. 12.5. Heb. to our old home;
sc. to the dust, from whence at first we were taken. Tremellius renders it in
domum saeculi, to the house of our generation, where we and all our
Contemporaries shall meet. Cajetan, in domum mundi, the house which the world
provideth for us; and to this house (much in Jobs mind, and therefore he here
says Thither) this house of the grave (as the Chald^e paraphraseth) men must
return naked. As he came forth of his mothers womb, naked shall he return to go
as he came (says Solomon) and shall take nothing of his labor which he may
carry away in his hand, Eccles. 5.15. Death as a porter, stands at the gate,
and strips men of all their worldly wealth, leaving them ne obolum quidem unde
naulum solvant.

Haud ullas portabis opes Acherontis ad undas.
Nudus ab inferna stulte vehere rate. Propert.

Some have had great store of gold and silver buried with them, but to small
purpose, more then to proclaim their own folly. Some wiser then some: if I must
leave all the rest, yet this I Will take with me, said a silly fellow, when giving
up the Ghost, he clapped a twenty shillings piece of gold into his mouth.
Athenaeus tells of one, Rog. of Lou.
that at the hour of his death, devoured many pieces of gold, and sewed the
rest in his coat, commanding that they should be all buried with him.
Hermocrates being loath that any man should enjoy his goods after him, made
himself by will, heir of his own goods. These muck-worms, like those ten men
Jer. 41.8. having treasures in the field, of wheat, barley, oil etc. are full
loath to part with them: and having much cattle, as those Reubenites and
Gadites, Numb. 32.5. they would feign live still on this side Jordan: having
made their gold their God, they cannot think of parting with it: they would if
possible, carry the world with them out of the world. But what says the
Apostle? We brought nothing with us into this world, and it is certain (see how
he assevereth and assures it, as if some rich wretches made question of it) we
can carry nothing out, nothing but a winding sheet; 1 Timothy 6, 7.
as Sultan Saladines shirt, which he commanded to be hung up at his burial; a
bare Priest going before the bier and proclaiming, Saladine the mighty Monarch
of the East is gone, and takes no more with him then what you here see. And to
the same sense the Poet speaking of Annibal, says, -- modo quam fortuna sovendo
Congestis opibus donisque refer sit opimis,
Nudum tartarea portarit navita cymba. Sil. Ital.



The Lord gave] It is his blessing upon the diligent hand, that makes rich,
Pro. 10.22. as without that, all pains and policies are but arena sine calce,
sand without lime, they will not hold together. Not only every perfect, (that
is, spiritual blessings in heavenly things) but every good gift, that is,
temporal blessings in creature comforts, come from above, from the Father of
lights, Jam. 1.17. as pledges of his love to those that are his, and as an
earnest of better things hereafter, Psalm. 23.67. Genesis 27.28. God give thee the
dew of heaven, says Isa^k to Jacob. Esau likewise has the like, but not with
a God give thee; he profanely sacrificed to his own net, not having God in all
his thoughts. He said with that Assyrian, Isai. 10.13. By the strength of my
hand have I done this: my power and the might of my hand has gotten me all
this wealth etc. Is not this great Babel that I have built etc? Job. Deuteronomy.
8.10, 11.
utters no such bubbles of words; he arrogateth nothing to himself, but
ascribes all to God, whom the heathens also acknowledge -- (...), Hom.
The giver of all Good.

And the Lord has taken away] As well he might; for though I had the
possession, yet he has the property; neither can he possibly do me wrong, since
he is Lord of all, and may dispose of me and mine as he pleases. Hierome
teaches his friend Julian to say, Tulisti liberos qu^s ipse dedoras: non
centristor quod recepisti, ago gratias quod dedisti: Thou have taken away the
children which thou had given me: I grieve not that thou have taken them, but
give thee thanks for giving them. Vitam reposcenti natura tanquam debtor bona
fidei reddituras exult^. Ammi^n. l. 25.
Julian that vile Apostate, said at his death, I gladly render up my life to
Nature requiring it; as a thankful and faithful debt^r. This was sure, but a
copy of his countenance, and merely for a name. And what shall we think of
Quin^us Fabius Maximus? who when he heard that his mother and wife whom he
loved dearly, were slain by the fall of an house, and that his younger son, a
brave hopeful young man, died the same time in Vmbria, he never changed his
countenance (though his friends lamented the loss with many tears) but went on
with the businesses of the Commonwealth, as if no such calamity had befallen
him; was this patience or stupidity, whether? Patience is a fruit of the
Spirit, Gal. 5.22. so that Aquinas needed not to have questioned, Aquin. 2, 2.
q. 136.
whether a man can have patience sine auxilio gratiae, without the help of Gods
grace. A natural man may, for sinister ends, bite in his pain, as Marius did,
when his leg was cut off by the Surgeon; he may conceal his grief, as
Mithridates did for a time; but all the while, he was in a kind of fever (
Epialis the Physicians call it) wherein men be cold without, but hot as fire
within. And the like we may judge of Philip the second King of Spain, who is
said to have born the loss of his invincible Armado that had been three years
a rigging, with much patience, giving, and commanding to be given all over
Spain, thanks to God and the Saints, that it was no more grievous. This was but
a fained and a forced patience: Camd. Elis. 371.
it was rather pertinacy then patience, it was an obstinate stiffenesse of mind
etc. Ye have heard of the patience of Job; and what was the ground of it? he
beheld God in all, the Lord has taken away; says he: not a word of the
Caldean and Sabean plunderers, not a tittle against the devil who had employed
them: and why? Job easily discerned Gods arrows in Satan's hand, and Gods hand
on the arms of those that had robbed him, and wronged him: hence Taceo, Fero,
Spero, was his motto. It is the Lord, said Eli, when threatened with the loss
of all. I was dumb (says David) because it was thy doing. So was Jacob for the
same reason, 1 Samuel 3.18. Psalm. 39. Genesis 34.5.
in the rape of Dinah his only daughter, afterward married to Job, say the
Jew-Doctors. So was Aaron in the untimely end of his untowardly children, Lev.
10.3. So was Mauricius the good Emperor, when he saw his wife and children
slain before his eyes by the traitor Phocas. And so was lastly, that noble Lord
of Plessis, who when he had lost his only son (a Gentleman of mavelous great
hope) in the Low Countries, and shortly after, his Lady died of that grief,
he took up those words of David; See his life.
I was silent, and said no word, because thou Lord had done it.

Blessed be the Name of the Lord] As well for taking away, as for giving: This
was a rare bird, that would thus sing in winter. It is easy to swim in a warm
bath, and every bird can sing in a warm sunshine: but to bless God heartily,
when afflicted most heavily; this, this is the breathing of an excellent
spirit: In every thing to give thanks, o quam hoc non est omnium! In this theme
of blessing God for afflictions, also Basil spends all his Sermon which he
entitleth, Giving of thanks in all things; Christianorum propria virtus est,
says Hierome, it is a virtue proper to true Christians, Hicr. in Ephesians. 5.
heartily, and not hollowly to give God thanks for crosses, for it proceeds
from the joy of faith, and some taste of Gods fatherly care of us in our
corrections. If good things befall thee, bless God, and they shall be
increased; if evil things, bless God, and they shall be removed, says
Austin; of whom also it is reported, that he had always in his mouth Deo
gratias, Thanks be to God for whatsoever befalls us. Si bona ded^rit D^us,
grattas agi^, and augebuntur etc.
The Prophet, Psalm 89.38. to 52. lamentably complains of the Churches
miseries, and yet concludes, Blessed be the Lord for evermore: and this he
does, not formally and sightly, but earnestly, and with much affection. Lo,
this is the guise of those that be gracious. But how blank (think we) was the
Devil, when hoping to hear Job blaspheme God, he hears him blessing Gods
Name in this sort, The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away: (...) Sept.
blessed be the Name of the Lord? The Greek and Latin translations insert here
another sentence that is not found in the Hebrew verity; viz. even as it
pleases the Lord, so come things to pass. Our late Common Prayer Book also
has the same words in the form for Burial of the dead.

Verse 22. In all this Job sinned not] The Greek and Latin versions add here,
with his lips: but I could rather be of Mercers judgment, who refers the
former part of this verse to the mind, and the later to the mouth: showing that
Job neither thought in his heart, nor uttered with his mouth any thing unmeet
and unworthy of God; insomuch, that both within and without, he carried away
the victory and conquest over Satan, B^z^.
and so better deserved to be Sainted then our Henry the sixth, of whom the
Chronicler writes thus. This King in both estates so demeaned himself, that
he modestly carried the one, and moderately under-went the other: yea, such was
his deportment, that the inconstancy of his state could not alter the constancy
of his mind; insomuch, that one of his successors, Dan. hist. contin. by
Trussel.
King Henry the seventh, labored for that only virtue, to have him canonized
for a Saint; and had obtained to have done it, had not the charges thereof so
far exceeded mediocrity, as to cause him to leave it undone. God himself has
here canonized, crowned and chronicled holy Job, for his many good properties
before, and here for his humility and patience: The trial of his faith being
much more precious then that of gold that perishes, though it be tried with
fire, is found to praise and honor and glory, 1 Pet. 1.7. It was a saying of
Philostratus, that one Jupiter set out by Homer the Poet, was worth ten set out
by Phydias the carver; because the former flew abroad through all the world;
whereas the other never stirred from his pedistal at Athens: so one Job thus
renowned by Gods own pen, is far beyond all that have been memorized in
humane histories for their aequanimity and constancy. In all this that Job
suffered, acted, and uttered, he sinned not, scil. sinningly: he was not
transformed into sins image; he sinned not by cursing God, as Satan hoped, and
would have had it: or charged God foolishly, or with folly; with any thing
insolent, insulse, unsavory; he charged him not in the least, to have dealt
unwisely or unworthily with him; and this is here mentioned, as Grace, Jam. 1.4.
almost to a miracle, as Patience having her perfect work, and proving Job to
be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

CHAP. II. Verse 1. Again there was a day]
WHether the next day, or the next Sabbath day, or the next first day of the
year, (which is Gods day of general Audit, as the Rabbines will have it) we
have not to say. God, as he has in his eternal counsel fore-appointed every
thing that is done; so he has set the times wherein, Eccles. 3.1. such as the
creature can neither alter, nor order. This is a comfortable consideration.

When the Sons of God etc.] See chap. 1.6.

And Satan came also among them] Whether summoned to give an account, or of his
own accord to sue out a new Commission against Job, it skilleth not. Restless
he is; and it behooveth us to be vigilant: not ignorant of his wiles, nor
unmindful of his inveterate envy and enmity.

Verse 2. And the Lord said unto Satan, etc.] See chap. 1.7.

From going to and fro in the earth] In heaven he comes not; into that earthly
paradise he could scrue himself, not so into the heavenly. No dirty dog ever
trampled on that golden pavement; those that are there, are ex^ra jactum out of
Satan's gunshot; but whilst here, he will ever and anon have a bout with the
best; he walks about for the nonce, spying advantages.

And from walking up and down in it] Doing his feats, and carrying news. It
might very well be he, who when Domitian the Emperor was slain by his own
servants at Rome, informed Apollonius Tyaneus thereof at Ephesus, where he is
said to have cried out the same time; To him Stephan; strike him, kill him. But
what a vainglorious vaunt of an impudent caytiffe was this, that though
vanquished as he had been by Job, and beaten on his own dunghill, he should
take upon him still in this sort, that he had been walking up and down as a
Conqueror or Emperor of this present world? Surely as Job still retained his
integrity, so did Satan his vanity; boasting that he came now from visiting his
estate; Sc^a^lt.
and that nothing rendered hm more glorious then the great number of his
subjects which depended upon his will.

Verse 3. And the Lord said unto Satan] Before he would condemn him, he thus
interrogateth him (which he would not vouchsafe to do, when he had deceived
our first parents, Genesis 3.14.) but with a very bitter taunt and sharp
reprehension; as if God should have said, Beza.
Art thou not ashamed Satan, thus to answer me, as if I had forgotten what I
granted thee in our last assembly, and thus in my presence to dissemble etc?

Have thou considered my servant Job] See chap. 1.8.

One that fears God etc.] This he did not without God (according to that
clause in the new covenant, I will put my fear into their hearts. Jer. 31.40.
I, is emphaticall and exclusive, q. d. I, and I alone) yet God gives him the
honor of it: as if he himself had been the sole doer. Certum est, nos facere
quod facimus; sed ille facit ut faciamus, says Austin; Sure it is, that we do
what good we do; but as sure it is, that God does all our works in us and for
us, Isai. 26.12.

And still be holds fast his integrity] which thou have striven quasi
^icedula extorquere, by wrinch and wile to get from him; but he has hitherto
held it fast as with tooth and nail. This was a singular commendation, and
that is a rare faith, which being long tried, does not flag and hang the wing.
By reason of the overflow of iniquity the love of many shall wax cold, (says
our Savior) but he that endures to the end shall be saved, Ma^th. 24.12, 13.
Lo, it is but a He, a single man that retains his integrity; when Many lose
their first love, and fall from their former steadfastness, as fast as leaves
fall in Autumn. Job would not part with his integrity to dye for it: when all
was taken away, he laid fast hold on that, and resolved to let go his life
sooner. Christ he saw standing over him (as once Steven did) and saying, Revel.
3.11.
Hold fast that thou have, that no one take thy crown from thee. Omnia perdidit
qui fidem amisit, says Seneca. In a common combustion, a man will be sure to
secure his jewels, what ever become of his lumber.

Although thou movedst me against him] That is, against his personal estate,
and his children, which are called himself; against these Satan is said to have
moved the Lord, to have incited and instigated him, stirring him up with
reasons and arguments; as he is an excellent Orator, if he may but have
audience. But that the Lord was hereby moved to do ought against Job, must be
wisely and rightly understood; for God is immutable and unmovable: neither can
he be drawn to do any thing, but what he has decreed to do from before all
beginnings: but here he speaks after the manner of men, as if he were
prevailed with by Satan's solicitations.

To destroy him] So Satan would have had it, when God meant to try him only.
See the like, Rev. 2.10.

Without cause] or for nothing (as the word signifies, chap. 1.10. Does Job
fear God for naught?) without any provocation or cause on his part procuring
it. Not but that there is cause enough in the best, why God should afflict
them: But as there was no peccatum flagrans in Jacob, Numb. 23.21. No foul sin
of that people, flaming at that time in the eyes of God, or stinking in his
nostrels; and therefore Bala^^ (the devils Spel-man) could do naught against
them by his enchantments, verse 23. Job non erat flagitiosus, Lavat.
So there was not in Job that gross hypocrisy, wherewith Satan had falsely
charged him: he was not that mercenary that Satan would have made of him. In
vain did that arch-slandere^ and accuser of the Saints move the Lord against
Job, Gratis, id est, Frustra, says Lyra; in vain did he assault this stout
champion, etc.

Verse 4. And Satan answered the Lord etc.] This impudent adversary had yet an
answer in his mouth, and would not be so set down. Of him and his agents (those
false teachers, as the Apostle calls them) it may be truly said, -- Nihil est
audacius illis. Juvenal.


Deprensis: iram atque animes ex crimine sumunt. Skin for skin.] Any skin for
his own, cattle, servants, children may be easily parted with by him, to save
himself in a whole skin, to keep himself whole: others read it, skin after
skin, or skin upon skin: both the Cutis and the Pellis shall go, so that life
may be preserved: as a man will hold up his arm to save his head, or suffer the
loss of a limb to save his life. Vt corpus redimas; ferrum patieris and ignes.
Job is still integracu^e, skin-whole, says Satan; and so long there is little
trial of him: that man is rich enough who is well. I read of one, who being
asked how old he was, answered, that he was in health: and to another that
asked how, rich he was, answered, that he was not in debt, q. d. He is young
enough that is in health; and rich enough that is not in debt. Now all this Job
was yet, and therefore Satan ill apaid and unsatisfied.

And all that he has will a man give for his life] Life is sweet, we say:
(...) Aesop. (...) Arist.
and man is a life-loving creature, says the Heathen; fond of life, and afraid
of death, which is Natures slaughterman, and therefore the most Terrible of
Terribles, as Aristotle styles it. The Gibeonites refused not to be perpetual
slaves, so they might but live. Those that are overcome in battle, are content
to be stripped of all, so they may have quarter for their lives. Mariners in a
tempest, cast their lading into the sea, though never so precious, in hope of
life. If Job may escape with the skin of his teeth, it is some favor: he may
not think much to sacrifice all that he has to the service of his life, his
conscience only excepted. Some good people have strained that too for love of
life: as when Abraham denied his wife; David changed his behavior; Camd. Elis.
fol. 325.
Peter denied his Master; Qu. Elizabeth (though afterward she could say, When
I call to mind things past, behold things present, and expect things to come, I
hold them happiest, that go hence soonest; yet) in Queen Mary's time, she
sometimes heard divine service after the Romish religion, and was often
confessed; yea, at the rigorous solicitation of Cardinal Pool, she professed
her self a Romish Catholic; yet did not Queen Mary believe her (says mine
Author) remembering that she her self, for fear of death, had by Letters
written with her own hand to her father, both renounced for ever the Bishop of
Romes authority, Ibid. Introd.
and withal acknowledged her father to be supreme head of the Church of
England under Christ, and her Mothers marriage to have been incestuous and
unjust. Those good souls did better, that loved not their lives unto death,
Rev. 12.11. that by losing their lives saved them, Matthew. 10.39. that held with
that Martyr, Julius Palmer.
that life is sweet only to such as have their souls linked to their bodies, as
a thiefs foot is in a pair of fetters.

Verse 5. But put forth thy hand now] See notes on chap. 1.11. This God did at
Satan's motion, yet non ad exitium Jobi, sed ad exercitium; Jobs temptation is
of Satan, but his trial and invincible constancy is of god. God in a sense
tempted Job. Satan also: even as the dog may be said to bait the beast, and the
owner of the beast too, that suffered him to be baited.

And touch his bone and his flesh] pinch him to the quick, that not his flesh
only may feel it, but the marrow also in his bones, Psalm. 6.2. and 32.3. and
51.8. The bone and flesh are the chief materials of man's body, which is fitly
compared to a fabric, wherein the bones are the timber-work, the head the
upper-lodging, the eyes as windows, the eyelids as casements, the brows as
pent-houses, the ears as watch-towers, the mouth as a door, to take in that
which shall uphold the building, and keep it in reparations; the stomach as a
kitchen, to dress that which is conveyed into it: the guts and baser parts as
sinks belonging to the house etc. as one makes the comparison. Now in all
these and the rest of his parts of body, Satan would have Job to be smitten:
and then he made no question of a conquest. Pain is a piercing shaft in Satan's
quiver of temptations: hence he stirred up his agents to tympanize and torment
the Martyrs with as much cruelty as the wit of malice could devise; but all in
vain. Heb. 11.35, 36. Apollonia had all her teeth pulled out of her head (hence
Papists make her the Saint for toothache.) Blandina tired those that tortured
her. Theodorus was cruelly whipped, racked, Scerat. Theodor.
and scraped with sharp shells, by the command of Julian, but yielded not. Rose
Allen had her hand-wrist burnt by Justice Tyrrell, who held a candle under it
till the sinews brake that all the house heard them; and then thrusting her
from him, violently said, ah strong whore, will thou not cry? thou shameless
whore, thou beastly whore, etc. But she quietly suffering his rage for the
time, at the last said, Sir, Acts and Mon. 1820.
have you done what you will do? and he said yea; and if thou think it not
well, then mend it. Mend it, said she? nay, the Lord mend you, and give you
repentance, if it be his will. And now, if you think it fit, begin at the feet,
and burn the head also; for he that set you a work, shall pay your wages one
day, I warrant you. As little got the devil by these worthies, as he did by
Jobs biles and carbuncles. We are ashamed, (said one of Julians Nobles to him)
we are Ashamed, O Emperor, the Christians laugh at your cruelty, and grow the
more resolute.

And he will curse thee to thy face] Heb. If he curse thee not to thy fade, q.
d. then damn me, send me to hell presently. This Satan holds in by an
Aposiopesis, being therein more modest then our desperate and detestable
God-damn-mee's; let them see how they gratify the devil, who curse and
blaspheme, or protest openly what they know to be false. This the devil did not.

Verse 6. And the Lord said unto Satan] who has his request: it is not always
a mercy to have what we wish. Deus saepe dat iratus, quod negat propitius. Be
sure we bring lawful petitions, and true hearts, Heb. 10.22. and then we shall
have good things, and for our greatest good.

Behold he is in thine hand] Here God puts his child into his slaves hand to
correct, but not to destroy. And surely, if we give reverence to the fathers of
our flesh, who correct us for their own pleasure, shall we not much more be in
subjection unto the Father of Spirits, Heb. 12 9, 10. Busbeq.
chastning us for our profit, and live? The Turks, though cruelly lasht, are
yet compelled to return to him that commanded it, to kiss his hand, and to
give him thanks, and to pay the officer that whipped them. This last we need not
do, but the former we ought, taking Gods part against our selves, and resting
contented; though as Paul delivered up some to Satan, that they might learn not
to blaspheme, so God deliver us up to him and his agents (such as Satanically
hate us, and are divellishly bent against us, Psalm. 32.21.) causing us to
suffer more then any ever did out of hell; that we may learn not to be proud,
secure, sensual, and may preach forth the virtues of him who has brought us
out of darkness into his mavelous light, 1 Pet. 2.9. Let us not say, if God
would take the rod into his own hand, I could better bear it: but the tender
mercies of that wicked one and his imps are mere cruelties. For 1. this is as
if the child should say, If I might choose my rod, I would not care to be
whipped: or the condemned Nobleman, If I might choose mine executioner, I would
not care to lose mine head. 2. It is but one hand, and many instruments that
God smites us with. Our enemies are but the men of Gods hand, Psalm. 17.14.
that can do no more then is given them from above, John ^9.^^. Gods Masons, to
hew us here in the Mount, that we may be as the polished corners of the Temple,
Psalm. 144.12. Gods scullions, to scowre up the vessels of his household, that
they may shine upon the celestial shelf, as that Martyr said. 3. God ever
reserveth to himself the royalty of setting them their task, limiting them
their time, and letting out their ^edder; hitherto ye shall go, and no further.
4. If they exceed their commission (as they are apt), Gods jealousy will smoke
against them, Zech. 1.14.

But save his life] Heb. his soul; put often for the life, the cause for the
effect: Satan shook his chain at Jobs soul, and would have destroyed it; but
that he might not do: scratch him he might with his paws, but not fasten his
fangs in him. Job could say (for a season at least) as that dying Saint did, My
body is weak, my soul is well. His afflictions, as afterward St. Paul's,
reached but to his flesh, Col. 1.24. And see that thou save his life too, says
God: (see how he chaineth up the devil, who would feign have been sucking Jobs
blood, and swallowing him down his wide gullet; Isa. 57.16.
1 Pet. 5.8.) Save it, that is, spare it; see that the Spirit fail not before
me, and the soul that I have made; I have yet some further use of him, though a
lamentable Lazar. Gal. 4.13, 14.
You know how through infirmity of the flesh; that is, notwithstanding the
infirmity and weakness of my body, I preached the Gospel, says Paul. and my
temptation which was in my flesh you despised not. Daniel, though sick, yet did
the Kings business; and Job, though scabbed all over, was yet of great use,
and reserved to great honor: therefore Save his life, says God: and the
devil, say the Rabbines, was as much vexed and wounded with this restraint, as
Job was with all his wounds and ulcers. It is surely a vexation to malice, not
to do its utmost.

Verse 7. So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord] The like is said
of Cain, when he meditated the murder of his innocent brother, and went to put
it in practice. Malefactors amongst us, we know, are indicted in this form. For
that thou, not having God before thine eyes, but moved by the instigation of
the devil, did --.

And smote Job] He pretended to touch him only, verse 5. but let every good man
bless himself out of Satan's bloody fingers: his iron entered into Joseph's
soul, his stroke was very vehement upon Jobs body, making totum pro vulnere
corpus: For he smote Job

With sore boiles] hot boiling boyles, such as the Sorcerers of Egypt were
smitten with, Exodus 9.10. and afterward the limbs of Antichrist, Rev. 16.2.
The Indian scab, some say it was, or the French disease, a most filthy and
odious ulcer it appears to have been, sore and mattery (why else should he so
scrape himself with a potsheard, as verse 8.) such as whose sharp and pricking
humor penetrated the very bone, and put him to exquisite pain, being worse to
him then Augustus his tres vomicae briae carcinomata, abovementioned: or
Philip the second of Spain his loathsome and lousie disease, whereof he died
Anno 1598. Instit. princip. cap. 20.
Carolus Scribanius thus describes it. This potent Prince for a long time
endured ulcerum magnitudinem, multitudinem, acerbitatem, foetorem etc. i. e.
Many great, sharp and stinking ulcers, which fastened him to his bed, as to a
cross, for a whole year before his death; besides six years torture by the
Gout, an hectic fever with a double tertian for two years space feeding upon
his bowels, and the very marrow of his bones; besides a most grievous flux for
two and twenty days, a continual nauseousnesse of his stomach, an
unsatisfiable thirst, a continual pain of his head and eyes, abundance of
matter working out of his ulcets, quae binas indies scutellas divite paedore
impleret: besides a most loathsome stench that took away his sleep etc. Alsted.
Chron. page 314.
thus he. Think the same, and worse of Job, the object of Satan's utmost malice,
and that for a whole year, say the Hebrews; for seven whole years, says
Suidas. chrysostom. de Laz.
Chrysostom compares him with Lazarus* and makes him to be in a far worse
condition. Pineda shows, that his sufferings were a great deal worse then
those of the wicked Egyptians under all their ten plagues; this was a boil, an
evil boil, says the text, one of the worst sort, the most painful and
malignant that might be, and this all over his body.

From the sole of the feet, unto his crown] It was all but one continued sore,
universal, as the leprosy, and therefore incurable; threatened as an utmost
plague, an evil, an only evil, D^ut. 28.35. If any part were left untouched, it
was his tongue and mouth, that it might be free to blaspheme God: and that
herein he was not smitten by Satan, some have observed from chap. 19.20. I am
escaped with the skin of my teeth, having no sores there, as I have all the
rest of my body over.

Verse 8. And he took him a pot sheard] a piece of a broken pot, for want of
better: ointments he had none, nor baths to lenifie his soreness. Physicians
and friends were far from him. He looked on his right hand, and beheld, Psalm.
14.2.4 Beza.
but there was no man that would know him: refuge failed and perished from him;
no man cared for his soul. He had still a wife and servants, and (as some
think) his household stuff left him. He should therefore by them have been
helped; but they helped on his misery, jeering him, and jesting at him, as he
afterward complains. Himself therefore in this necessity, takes a
potsheard, a piece of an earthen-pot, thereby to mind himself, says Gregory,
that he was of the earth, earthy. For which cause also

He sat down among the ashes] or dust, as repenting in dust and ashes, chap.
42.6. (...).
So Jonah 3.6. Matthew. 11.22. The Septuagint say, that he sat upon the dirt or
dung, for want of a better cushion, and that he was laid without the City, as
if for the stink and ill savor that came from him, he was not suffered to be
in the City: as Vzziah afterward being a Leper, dwelt in a house by himself
alone, 2 Chronicles. 26.21. Disce hic, si aegrotas, says Lanater, Learn here, if
thou be sick, and have help about thee, of friends, food, physic, clean
linen, and the like, In loc.
to show thy self patient: poor Job had none of all this. Nay, the Lord Christ
had not whereon to rest his head. Sin autem omni cura and solatio es
destitutus, says he. But say thou be destitute of all cure and comfort, forced
to lie without doors, and upon the hard ground; say thou be in such a
condition, that thou can neither stand nor go, nor sit, nor lie, nor eat
(either for want of meat, or want of stomach): comfort thy self with this, and
the like examples of the Saints. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and what
end the Lord made, James 5.11. He raises the poor out of the dust, and lifts
up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among Princes, and to make them
inherit the throne of glory, 1 Samuel 2.8. Again, let no man trust to his
present prosperity: Job, who heretofore spoke not to his subjects but from his
throne, was now seated upon a dunghill: and his hands accustomed to bear the
Scepter, were employed to wipe the matter which distilled from his sores, as
the French Paraphrast has it.

Verse 9. Then said his wife] Was this Dinah, Jacobs only daughter? so the
Jew-Doctors say; and that Job had a fair daughter by her, whom Potipher
married; and that of her came Asenaz whom Joseph married. They tell us also
(but who told them all this?) that she was hitherto spared, when all Jobs
outward comforts were taken away, for Jacob her fathers sake. Moreover, the
Septuagint here help her to scold, adding a whole verse of female passion, I
must now, says she, go wander, and have no place to rest in, etc. Job said
nothing all this while; not because he was either insensible or sullen; but
because it was God that did it, Psalm 39.2. and he had well deserved it, Mic.
7.9. I will bear (thinks he) the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned
against him. Yet my soul be silent to Jehovah etc. Psalm. 12.1.
Satan therefore (who waited for his cursing of God, as a dog waits for a
bone, but was defeated) cunningly sets his wife awork, by her venomous
words, to make him speak at least, and by her unseemly and sinful counsel, to
draw him to do wickedly. Some think, says Chrysostom, that the devil in the
shape of Jobs wife, spoke thus unto him; and surely their words agree; He will
curse thee to thy face, says he; Curse God and die, says she. Chrysostom
himself thinks, that the devil (if he spoke not in her, yet) spoke by her, as
he did once to Eve by the Serpent, and that he borrowed her mouth, using her as
a strong Engine, to a wall of adamant, as the choicest arrow in his quiver, to
wound Jobs righteous soul; and as a scaling-ladder, whereby to get up into
this impregnable tower, as Gregory has it. Per costam tanquam ser scalam ad
cor Adami ascendit. Greg. Moral. l. 3. c. 3.
He had tried this course before with Adam, and had singular success, Genesis
3.6. he had by his rib (as by a ladder) gotten up to his heart; yea, with his
rib broken his head, as one phraseth it, darting in death at the windows of
his ears. This he assayed upon Job, but without effect: his ears were waxed up,
his heart fixed etc. although he could not but be vexed that his wife should do
it; especially since hereby his servants and friends would be encouraged to do
the like. O wives, says one! the sweetest poison, the most desired evil etc.
Sir Thomas Moore was wont to say, that men commit faults often, women only
twice, that they neither speak well, nor do well. This may be true of bad
wives, such as Jezebel who stirred up Ahab (of himself forward enough) to do
wickedly with both hands earnestly, 1 King. 21.25. This in Jobs wise might be a
particular failing, though a foul one. Women are the weaker vessels, and
naturally more passionate: they must have their allowance, as light gold has.
She in the text had no small trials, and he is a perfect man that offends
not with his tongue.

Do thou still retain thine integrity?] Cuibono, as he said: what gettest
thou by it? Is not this thy fear, thy confidence; the uprightness of thy
ways, and thy hope? Lo Eliphaz (who should have had more grace and government
of his tongue then Jobs wife) scoffeth religious Job. as some sense that text,
chap, 4.6. rendering the words thus; Is not thy fear (or religion) become thy
folly? Where is now thine uprightness, and hope of reward? It is an ancient
and an ordinary slurre and slander cast upon the ways of God, as if they were
unprofitable, as if God were an austere man, an illiberall Lord: as if there
were no gain in godliness, nothing to be got by it but knocks, crosses,
losses, etc. whereas God is a rewarder of all those that diligently seek him,
Heb. 11.6. He recompenseth the losses of his people, as the King of Poland did
his noble servant Zelislaus, to whom having lost his hand in his wars, he sent
a golden hand instead thereof. He rewards the sufferings of his Saints, as
Caius the Emperor did Agrippa, who had suffered imprisonment for wishing him
Emperor. The History says, that when he came afterward to the Empire, the
first thing he did, was to prefer Agrippa, and gave him a chain of gold, as
heavy as the chain of iron that was upon him in prison. The devil could have
told this peevish woman, that Job did not serve God for naught, chap 1.9. See
Mal. 1.10. and 3.14. with the Notes.

Curse God and die] What cursed counsel was this? and from her who should have
administered conjugal help to him? How well might Job have turned her off with
Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offense unto me? These were the devils
words and not the woman's, says Chrysostom; it was her tongue, but the devil
tuned it, says Origin. Curse God and die, for he will not endure thee to live,
having once so set thy mouth against heaven, but will quickly set thee packing
by a visible vengeance: or, Curse God, and then dye by thine own hands; having
first spit thy venom in his face for having handled thee so hardly, after so
good service done him. Hacket did thus at the gallows, Anno 1591. threatening to
set fire on heaven, Camd. Eli. 403
to pluck God out of his Throne, if he would not show some miracle out of the
clouds to convert those infidels that brought him to execution, and to deliver
him from his enemies: having the rope about his neck, he life his eyes to
heaven, and grinning, said, Do thou repay me this for a Kingdom bestowed? I
come to revenge it etc. O wretch I By the way observe, that Satan is a (...)
(as Hegesias the Philosopher was called) a perswader of people, that death is
an end, at least an ease of outward troubles, when as to the wicked death is
but a trap-door to hell: we silly fish, see one another jerked out of the pond
of life, but we see not the fire, and the drying pan whereunto those are cast
that die in their sins, to whom all the sufferings of this life are but a
typical hell, the beginning of those terrors and torments which they shall
hereafter suffer, without any the least hope of ever either mending or ending.

Verse 10. But he said unto her] He did not start up, and lay upon her with his
unmanly fist, ( Chrysostom says, it is the greatest reproach in the world for
a man to beat his wife) but he reproves her, and that sharply, as she
deserved: and so did Jacob his best beloved Rachel, when the offense was
against God, Genesis 30.2. A wise husband, says Marcus Aurelius, must often
admonish, never smite, and but seldom reprove, and that with the spirit of
meekness too, Gal. 6.1. Meekness of wisdom, Jam. 3.13. That was wonderful
patience that was exercised by D. Youngs Benef. of Afflict. 153.
Cowper Bishop of Lincoln, who, when his wife had burnt all his Notes which he
had been eight years in gathering, left he should kill himself with overmuch
study (for she had much ado to get him to his meals) showed not the least
token of passion, but only replied, Indeed wife, it was not well done; so
falling to work again, he was eight years in gathering the same Notes,
wherewith he composed his Dictionary. Job, though somewhat more tart, as reason
required, the offense being of so high a nature; yet he breaks not out into
fierce and furious language: he says not, Go, go, thou art an arrant fool, a
wicked woman, an abominable wretch, but

Thou speak like one of the foolish women] like one of the women of Idumea
that have no sap of wisdom or goodness in them, but do whip their gods, (as
the Chinois are said to do at this day) when they cannot have what they would
have of them, and revile them for neglecting their worshippers. Note here, that
Jobs wife might be a good woman for the main, though in this particular she did
amiss: but it is a fault in Gods people, when it shall be said unto them, Are
ye not carnal, and walk, as men? when it shall be said of Gods daughters, that
they speak or act like one of the foolish women. David's daughters were known by
their party-colored garments, so should Gods by the law of wisdom in their
lips and lives, by their patient mind made known to all men, by their eximious
and exemplary holiness. What should Jobs wife, the Governesse of such a
religious Family, the yoak-fellow of such an holy Husband, be talking of
cursing God? be speaking after the rate of profane Edomites? The Heathen
Comedian can say, that she is a wise woman who can be well content to suffer
hardship; and not repine, that it is now worse with her then formerly it has
been: Job would fain bring his wife to this, Quae aquo animo pati potest sibi
esse pejus quam fuit.
and therefore adds,

What? shall we receive good etc] He seeks to set her down, not with rage,
but with reason: and that indeed is the right way of backing a reproof: wherein
as there must be some warmth, so it may not be scalding hot. Words of reviling
and disgrace, they scald, as it were: But words that tend to convince the
judgment, and to stir up the conscience to a due consideration of the fault,
they be duly warm, and tend to make the physic work the more kindly.

Shall we receive good at the hands of God, and not evil?] Shall we not eat
the crust with the crumbs? drink the sour with the sweet? bless God as well
for taking away, as for giving; accept of the chastisement of our iniquity?
receive it patiently, thankfully, fruitfully? Shall we be all for comforts, and
nothing at all for crosses? Is it not equal that we should share in both, since
it is the Lords mercy that we are not consumed? Genesis 49.28. Jacob is said to
have blessed all his sons. Now he seemed rather to curse Reuben, Simeon and
Levi; for he speaks only of evil to them: But because they were not rejected
from being among Gods people, because they were not cut out of the list (as Dan
afterward was, 1 Chronicles. 7. Revel. 7.7.) though they were under great and sore
afflictions, they are counted blessed. Doles quod amisisti? gaude quod ^
vasisti, says Seneca: Grievest thou at thy losses? be glad that thy self art
escaped. Be ready at all hours, to send God home again the blessings which he
lent us, with thankfulness. There is a complaint of some men, so ungrateful,
that if you do them nineteen courtesies, Auson.
and then deny them the twentieth, you lose all your thank with them: Carry
them on your back to the very suburbs of Rome, and not into the City it self,
you do nothing for them. God is not to be thus dealt with; especially, since he
alters the property of those evils and crosses which he lays upon us,
turning them to our greatest good, Romans 8.28. like as the skillful Apothecary
turns a poysonfull Viper into a wholesome Triacle. Good therefore and worthy
of all acceptance is that counsel of the Wiseman, In the day of prosperity
be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider. Consider? What? This, that
God also has set the one over against the other, Eccles. 7.14.
and therefore thou must take the one as well as the other: that is but
reasonable and equitable. Plato says, that God does always (...), act the
Geometrician, do and dispose of all things in number weight and measure: such
an order and vicissitude he has set of good and evil in the life of man, that
they are as it were interwoven. Accept them therefore, and acquiesce in them
both, as the Hebrew word here signifies.

In all this Job sinned not with his lips.] Hitherto he did not, though in a
pitiful pickle, and much provoked by the wife of his bosom. He did not
murmr against God, nor let fly at his wife; he did not threaten her as
Lamech, nor fall out with the whole sex, as he that said, Foemina nulla bona
est. He does not wish himself single again, Sylla foelix, si non habuisses
uxorem. Chaldaus Paraphrastes and Talmudici.
as Augustus did, or hold himself therefore only unhappy because married, as
Sylla did. No such unsavory speech falls from Jobs lips, as the Devil wished
and waited for it. Neither does it follow (as some Rabbines would infer from
this Text) that Job sinned in his heart, though not with his lips: for out of
the abundance of the heart the mouth would have spoken. Look what water is in
the Well, the like will be in the Bucket: and what stuff is in the warehouse,
the like will be in the shop. If his heart had been exulcerate, he would not
meekly and wisely have withstood his Wives motion to blaspheme. Hitherto
certainly, God had helped him. It was the uncouth and unkind carriage of his
friends concurring with the increase of his bodily pain, besides the eclipse
of inward comforts, that drew from him those passionate expressions, chap. 3.

Ver. 11. And when Jobs three friends] His familiar friends, that did eat of
his bread, as Psalm. 49.9. that were as his own soul, Deuteronomy. 13.6. his bosom
friends, and therefore precious Jewels, such as could both keep counsel, and
give counsel. Of such there are but few to be found. Friends, there is no
friend, said Socrates. Faithful friends, (...)
says Another, are in this age all for the most part gone in pilgrimage, and
their return is uncertain. A Friend is a changeable creature, says a Third;
all in changeable colors like the Peacock, as often changed as moved. Job
complains of these his chief and choice friends, that they were miserable
Comforters, Physicians of no value, chap. 16.2.
etc. Amicitia sit tantum inter binos, eosque bonos; such as were Jonathan and
David. Corporibus geminis spiritus unus erat.

Heard of all this evil] Whether by the ministry of the good or bad Angels, or
of neither, it skilleth not. Ill news is swift of foot, says the Greek
Proverb; and like ill weather, (...)
which comes ere it be sent for. The sins and miseries of good people are much
talked of, and soon bruited abroad. The Chaldee Paraphrast here tells of
strange businesses, viz. that these three here mentioned (besides the report
they heard of Jobs calamity) were moved to visit him by the wonders that fell
out with them at the same time: for their trees suddenly withered in their
Ort-yards, their bread at their table was turned into raw flesh, their wine
into blood, etc. But this may well pass for a Jewish fable: The Author of that
Paraphrase was R. Joseph Cacus, nothing so ancient or authentic as he who
paraphraseth upon the historical books, but exceeding full of mistakes, and
seldom comes he near the right meaning of the Text, all along the Hagiographa.

They came every one from his own place] More then these came to such a sight,
no doubt: but these out of a desire and design to condole with him, and
comfort him. But it fell out far otherwise: for they tormented Job well nigh as
much as Satan himself, though it were of ignorance, and unwittingly, rather
then of ill will, or malice forethought. Their very silence and gesture before
ever they spoke a word, did so torment his mind, that at last he cries out in
that bitter manner, as chap. 3. like a frantic man, which through some
grievous sickness has lost his wits.

Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhitt etc. Idumeans all (likely) and
men of much estimation for wisdom ( Jer. 49.7. Is Wisdom no more in Teman?)
and godliness, as descended all of Abraham, whose care was to catechize his
whole Family, and to teach them the ways of God, Genesis 18.19. Their following
disputations show as much, wherein they admonish him to repent, assuring him,
that he could be no less then a gross sinner, and an hypocrite, because so
grievously afflicted. Job answers their several speeches, tormented in body,
perplexed in mind, but stoutly defending his own innocence, and seeming to tax
the Lord also; like as dogs in a chase bark at their own Masters. To this, his
friends reply sharply from chap. 15. to 22. and he answers them again with
greater boldness and courage then before. Hereupon they begin a second reply,
and here Eliphaz and Bildad only spoke: The third man fainted and spoke no
more, for that Job was invincible etc. till at length Elihu moderateth,
censuring both parties; and God determines, to Jobs conviction and final
commendation.

For they had made an appointment together to come] Not by accident, or at
adventure, as Origin will needs have it against the Text; but by solemn
agreement; it was a pitched meeting. Neither staid they till they were sent for,
but came (as friends) to do Job all friendly offices: like as in a fright, the
blood and spirits run to the heart to relieve it. A friend loves at all times,
and a brother is born for adversity, Prove. 17.17. See the Note there.

To mourn with him] Heb. To shake the head, or other parts of the body, in
token of commiseration: to bewail his condition, as Cyprian did the persecuted
Saints of his time, Cum singulis pectus meum copulo, says he: Moeroris pondera
luctuosa participo, etc. Who is offended, and I burn not? 2 Cor. 11.29.

And to comfort him] This they intended, but proved miserable comforters too,
by reason of the deceitfulness of their hearts, fitly therefore compared to a
broken or a deceitful bow, that carries the arrow a clean contrary way. So
Jonah prayed unto the Lord. chap. 4.2. He thought to have prayed, but it proved
that he brawled: Psalm. 78.57 The word rendered to comfort, signifies likewise
to mourn with the mourning of repentance, to teach us here to begin our pity to
others, to bewail their and our owe sins.
see the Note there. These men's words were as a murdering weapon in Jobs
bones; pious they were, and divine all along, but much mis-applied. It is said
of them, that they handled an ill matter well, and Job a good cause as ill,
especially when once he came to be wet through.

Verse 12. And when they lift up their eyes afar off] Hence some conclude
that Job lay abroad, as lepers used.

And knew him not] for they had never seen him before, but in a splendidous
fashion; now then to see him in such a pickle, that he had lost all form and
fashion, more like a dead beast, then a living man; this amazed and amused
them; they might also by this so sad a spectacle, be admonished of their own
mutable and miserable condition ( Aut sumus, aut fuimus, aut possumus esse quod
hic est) and have the same thoughts, as the Psalmist afterward had, Man being
in honor, abides not; Psalm. 45.12*
he is like the beasts that perish, pecoribus morticinis, says Tremellius, the
beasts that die of the murraine, and so become carrion, and are good for
nothing. Job was now no otherwise to be seen, then as a stinking carcass full
of sores, more like then a living man, as he painteth out himself in most
lively colors.

They lifted up their voice and wept] Good men are apt to do so, says the
Poet, and faciles motus men's generosa capit; we are bound to weep with those
that weep, and to be both pitiful and courteous, 1 Pet. 3. To him that is in
misery, pity should be showed from his friend. (it was so to Job here at first)
but he forsakes the fear of the Lord, Job 6.14. Jobs friends did so, when
amazed with the greatness of his calamity, they therehence concluded him an
arrant hypocrite, unworthy of any one word of comfort.

And they rent every one his mantle] His stately mantle, his robe of state,
such as men of great honor used to wear, Stolam regiam. Some Hebrews and
Jesuits will have these three friends of Job to have been Kings; such I
believe they were as the three Kings of Collen, so the Papists call those wise
men, Matthew. 1.2. be they what they will; they rent every man his mantle in
token of greatest sorrow at their friends calamity, a ceremony not unusual
among other Nations, then those of the East. Suetonius tells us, that Julius
Caesar, when he had passed his Army th River Rebican, In vita C. Jul Caesar.
and was marching toward Rome, he made a speech to his Soldiers, weeping and
rending his garment: that thereby he might testify to them what a grief it was
to him to fight against his Country: which he would never have done, had there
not been a necessity.

And sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven] They so threw it up into
the air, that it might fall upon their heads: to import 1. That all things were
full of sorrowful confusion, as here earth and air were mingled. 2. That
themselves and all mortals were but dust, Genesis 18. a little dirt neatly made
up) and to dust they should return, Genesis 3 little deserving in the mean while
to tread upon the earth, or to be above ground, Josh. 7.6. See chap. 1.16.

Verse 13. So they sat down with him upon the ground] Though his sent and
loathsomeness were intolerable, yet they bare him company: this was love and
sympathy, thus to sit by him on the ground, then when every one loathed him,
and would not lend him a hand to help to scrape him.

Seven days and seven nights] Not all this time, but the most part of it,
without giving almost any regard to their ordinary rest, and necessary
sustenance. Origin says, they were sustained and preserved all that while
without sleep and meat, by a miracle: Others holding it a thing impossible,
have therefore judged this whole book to be a parable only.

And none spoke a word unto him] So great was their grief; Curae leves
l^quuntur, ingentes stupent. Calvin thinks they were too blame, to be so long
silent. Belike, they were loath to be troublesome, and waited a fit opportunity;
looking that he should speak first, and harboring hard conceits of him.

For they saw that his grief was very great] His pain was extreme, and
therefore no time to talk with him. Besides, though they came prepared, yet
altering their opinions of him, they doubted how, and what to speak, till at
length they became Satan's advocates.

CHAP. III. Verse 1. After this]
AFter so long silence of his friends, and to provoke them to speak, who happily
waited for some words from him first, as knowing him wise and well-spoken. Or
After this] After that Jobs pains were somewhat allayed, so that he could
breath, recollect himself, and utter his mind: for some troubles are above
speech, Psalm 77.4 they will hardly suffer a man to take breath; Job. 9.18. (see
Esth. 4.14. with the Note) or to hear any thing, though never so wholesome or
comfortable, Exodus 6.9.

Job opened his mouth] But better he had kept it closed still; either be
silent, says the Greek Proverb, or else say something that is better then
silence. But it may befall the best (lest to themselves) to speak unadvisedly
with their lips, as meek Moses did at the waters of Meribah, for which sin of
his (some Jews say) that he was damned, because we read not of his repentance.
And a like wretched censure they pass upon holy Job for his cursing his day
here; saying, that although in words he cursed the creature only, Confuted by
Lyra and Hugocard. in Josh. 1 2.
yet interpretatively and indeed, he cursed the Creator; like as he that
spitteth upon a Kings picture, or robe royal, does the same to the King
himself. But why do they not then say the same of Jeremy, and pronounce him a
Reprobate for cursing his birth day too? chap. 20.14. R. Levi answers,
because it appears to be otherwise by Jeremies whole prophecy besides. And
may we not say the like for Job, if we wisely weigh his words in their right
sense, and the end which the Lord made, Jam. 5.11. propounding him for a
pattern of patience, not of impatience, whereof, nothing is said against him,
though he had his out-bursts, as here; and must have his allowance (as good
gold has when it comes to the scale) that so he may pass. If he had
blasphemed God, or denied his providence, ascribing all events to the
conjunction of the stars at a man's birth (as the Talmudists falsely gather from
this Chapter) Satan had had his design upon him; and God would never have
justified him, and preferred him before his friends, as he did, chap. 42. True
it is, that chap. 38.2. when he had spoken his mind over-freely, and indeed
sinfully (as there is not a man upon earth, that lives, and sins not) as if
the Lord had dealt unkindly, if not unequally with him; God in the end steppeth
forth, (as it were, from behind the hangings) over-hearing him, and taking him
up: Who is this (says he there) that talks thus? how now? After which, Job
was not only hushed, chap. 40.4, 5. but humbled, chap. 42.6. And truly it should
be considered (say both Ambrose and Chrysostom, in Jobs defense) that though
patient in the two former Chapters, yet now he begins to be wet to the skin;
yea, the drops of Gods wrath began to soake into his soul: the devil also set
upon him with all violence, as some conceive from the next verse, Job answered
and said, so. to some dispute with the devil. Now therefore that he thus
falls a roaring and a cursing his day, it is, says Chrysostom, as a sick
man, who being under the Physicians hands, of whom he is well persuaded, uses
all patience toward him; but being in extremity of pain, lays about him, and
strikes at the standers by etc. Exemplo Jobi liquet, says another good Writer;
By this example of Job it appears, that in extreme trials of the best, it often
falls out, that pain and grief speaks, rather then the man himself, and
that in the sieve of temptations, upon a more violent sifting, Bucholc.
the holes being worn or widened, not the offall only, but some grains of good
wheat (that is, of faith) do slip through: which yet the right hand of a
gracious God, is wont to gather, and to lay up in the granary of his grace. Job
cannot altogether be excused, (says Ferus upon this chapter) neither is he
said, as before, not to have sinned in these following expressions. Rather it
is to be held, that the Lord, who before stood by him, now for a time left him,
to try what is in man, even the best man living, if he be not strengthened by
God continually. David was most courageous when he went against Goliath; but
fearful when Saul pursued him. Eliah was most zealous for the Lord of Hosts,
when he slew 450 of Baals Priests: Tantus tamen fulminator ad Jezabelis minas
trepidat, suctus seipso imbecillior, says one; and yet this valiant Prophet
flies at the threats of Jezabel, and hears from heaven, Bucholc.
What do thou here Elias? So Jeremy, Peter, Father Latiemr, Pray for me
(says he) I say, pray for me, for I am sometimes so fearful, that I would
creep into a Mouse-hole; sometimes God does visit me again with his comforts:
so he comes and goes, to teach me to feel and know mine infirmity. Thus he
writes to B. Ridley; Acts and Mon. 1565.
with whom he afterward suffered at the same stake. His last words were,
Fidelis est Deus etc. God is faithful, who will not suffer us to be tempted
above that we are able etc. This was also Jobs comfort, when himself,
doubtless; for at this time it was Ego non sum Ego with him and God considered
it: for he knows our mould, he remembers we are but dust.

And cursed (...) day] Diom, non Deum: his day, and not his God, as the devil
would have had it. It was too much howsoever of that: and Job should have
opened his mouth to better purpose. In the Revelation, whenever heaven
opened, some memorable matter followed* when wisdom opens his mouth, she
speaks excellent things, Prove. 8.6. When Asaph, opened his mouth, he spoke
parables, Psalm. 78.2. When our Savior did so, he delivered that famous Sermon
in the Mount, Matthew. 5.2. But Job. alas, in the extreme pain of his body, and
anguish of his soul, opens his mouth; and curses bitterly: curses his day
in a most emphaticall manner, and in most exquisite terms, wishing all the
evil to it that it was any way capable of. Now the day that he here curses,
is either the day wherein he suffered such a world of evils, as Obad. 12. Isa.
2.12. Or rather the day which gave occasion to his sufferings, his birthday,
as verse 3 Jeremy did the like by a like infirmity, chap. 20 14 and some
others: but never has any yet been heard to curse the day of his new birth,
nor ever shall; as whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious
promises, that by these we might be partakers of the Divine Nature; having
escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust: and besides an
entrance ministered unto us further and further into the everlasting Kingdom of
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 2 Pet. 1.4, 11. There is a (...), a
multiplied happiness in holiness.

Verse 2. And Job spoke and said] Heb. answered and said. Answered? whom
answered he? The Jew-Doctors say, he answered his friends, who having hitherto
said nothing to him, and heard as little from him, at length -- rupere silentia
(...), and asked him what he ailed? others more probably conceive that Job
answered here to some dispute in his own mind, or rather with the devil. Some
take this verse for a transition only. Others make it a preparation for Jobs
future discourse, to move expectation, and win attention. The discourse indeed
is all along to chap. 42.7. Poetical, and very accurate, made up in Hexameters
(as Hierome holds) not by Job and his friends at the first uttering, but
afterward by Job at better leisure: or, as some think, Sic and Jonas orationem
sua^; in ventre balanahabitum, and David pl^rosque Psalmos etc.
by Moses whilst a shepherd in Midian, for the comfort of his poor
Countrymen in Egypt. Mercer says that his predecessor Vatablus (as he and
heard) had found out a way of scanning these Hexameters to others unknown, and
to all, the more obscure, because the verse causes a cloud. The first
Hexameter that ever was made in Greek, is said to be this, (...). Anno Mundi
2580, Prima vates Phemo^oi A^^ed. Chronol. 468.

Birds bring your plumes, and Bees your wax at once.


Verse 3. Let the day perish wherein I was born] He curses his birthday,
which the Greeks call (...): the beginning of a man's Nativity they call the
begetting of his misery; because he is non p^ius natus quam dumnatus, no sooner
born but damned to the Mines of misery, Job 14.1. Crying he comes into the
world, Aug.
and before he speaks, he prophesies, and says in effect, (...) etc, Nasci
pena, labor vita, necesse mori.
O that I had never been born. Woe worth th day
That brought me forth, and made me not away!


This whole life is orespread with sins and miseries as with a filthy morphew;
or as Job was with his leprosy: the anguish whereof, together with his inward
troubles so grieved and galled him, that he not only cries but, (which is
natural for a man to do) but giving the rains wholly to his grief, he roareth
and rages beyond all reason; and had not the spirit held him back, he would
surely have run headlong into blasphemy and desperation, which was Satan's
design. But in the Saints, as the Flesh lusts against the Spirit, and
sometimes getting the upper ground (as it were) bears it down, as here in Job
at this present: so the Spirit again lusts against the flesh, and a great
bustle there is in the good soul (as when two opposite things meet together,
cold saltpeter, and hot brimstome, there is a great noise; and as when Paul
came to Ephejus, there was no small stir about that way, Acts 19.23. etc.)
Gal. 5.17.
so that ye cannot do the things that ye would, says the Apostle. As Job
cannot do and say the good that he would, because of the flesh; so neither
could he do or say the evil that he would because of the spirit: he curses
indeed his day, but not his wise nor friends, much less his God, as those male
contents did, Isa. 8.21. Nay, so soon as God came into his mind verse 20. the
flesh was thereby, though not altogether quailed and quelled, yet so far
daunted and damped, that it kept it self within the compass of weeping and
wailing; and God himself, though he find fault with Jobs speeches for
unadvised, and sometimes ranging beyond the precincts of godliness: yet
acquitting him from all gross sin, he crowns him with the garland of a
famous vict0ory, as Mr. Beza here well observes. Most wisely therefore and
fitly does Saint James warn us, that in thinking upon Job, we regard not so
much what was done while the combat lasted, as what end the Lord make. Jam.
5.11. The Saints do never more prevail and triumph, then when it seems
otherwise. See Rev. 13.7. with chap. 12.11. they gather strength by opposition,
and conquer in being conquered, Sen^^.
Romans 8.37. They repent of their our hursts, as Job did chap. 42. And Qu^^
(...) he is little less then innocent who is afterward penitent. Ambr. in
Psalm.
Yea, it is almost mere to repent of a fault, says a Father, then to have been
free from the fault.

And the night] He would be sure so ^it the time, whether it were day or night.
He that is (...) out of Gods way, known not where he shall stop, or when he
(...) step back. Take heed therefore to they ways, that thou sin not with thy
tongue, Psalm. 39.1. Jam. 3.
that unruly member.

-- Hanc fr^nis, hanc ^^ compesce catenis. When Gods hand is on thy back, let
thy hand be on thy mouth, keep it as with a bridle or muzzle, Psalm. 39.1.
Passionate speeches te^iter volant, non ^^viter violant. The best that come of
them, is repentance: Job when he was once out, could keep no mean; but what he
had said against day and night, he amplifieth by the parts: and first for the
Day ver. 4.5. and then for the Night 6, 7, 8. etc.

Verse 4. Let that day be darknesse] thick darkness, as that once was in
Egypt, Exodus 10.23. A day of trouble and distress, a day of darkness and
gloominesse, a day of clouds and thick darkness, Zeph. 1.15. Let it be a
dreadful and a dismal day; let sorrow and sadness overshadow it, let
mourning and tears overwhelme it: let it be as when the Sun hides his head in
a mantle of black, and is eclipsed; at which time all creatures here below,
flag and hang the head. In the gloomiest day there is light enough to make it
day, and distinguish it from night, though the Sun shine not. But Job would
have no light to appear on his birthday. Thus be throws out words without
wisdom, and as Hinds by calving, so he by talking casts out his sorrows.
Job 39.3.


Let not God regard it^] or require it; let it pass as not worth looking
after, let him not take care of it, or power down any special blessing upon
it, as he does upon his people every day, but especially upon the Sabbath Day,
Gods market day, called by the Jews desiderium dierum, the desire of days,
and by the Primitive Christians Dies Lucis, the Day of Light.

Neither let the light shine upon it] And what is the air without light that
first ornament of the visible world? so what are all creature comforts, unless
God shine through them? What a wo-case is that poor soul in, that walks in
darkness and has none of his light, Isa. 50.10. how lamentable is such an one
deserted, ^e^ghted! how does he find himself in the very suburbs of hell it
self, where the pain of loss is greater then the pain of sense, 2 These 1.9.
and to note thus much, Job here, after he had said, Let that day be darkness,
adds as a greater evil, Let not the light shine upon it.

Verse 5. Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it Let it be ^^es
luctuosus and ^ethalis, such a deadly dark day, that each man may think it his
last day, fatal and feral, Let there not be dimnesse only (such as appears
through a painted glass, died with some obscure color) but horrid and hideous
darkness, such as was that at our Saviors passion, when the Sun was totally
^^^^ed, and a great Philosopher thereupon cried out, either the God of Nature
suffers, or the world is at an end. To darkness Job here emphatically adds
the shadow of death. The shadow is the dark part of the thing, so that the
shadow of death is the darkest side of death, death in its blackest
representation. Now let these stain it, says he, or challenge it, or espouse
it. In nocte funestatur mund^ (...), says Tertullian elegantly.

Let a cloud dwell upon it] Cresc^t (...) Auxesin oration. Job heaps up words,
like in sound, and not unlike in sense. Grief had made him eloquent: as hoping
thereby to ease himself. Let a cloud dwell upon it, a fixed cloud, not such an
one as continually hangs over the Island of St. Thomas on the back side of
Africa, Abbo^s G^^g. 251.
wherewith the whole Island is watered: nor such a^dloud of grace as God
promises to create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and upon her
assemblies, that upon all his glory may be a defense Isa. 4.5. But such as St.
Paul and his company were under before the shipwreck, Act. 27. when neither
Sun nor star appeared for many days together, the heavens being wholly
muffled etc.

Let the blackness of the any terrify it] or Let the ^eat of the day terrify
it: as it befalls those that live under the torrid Zone, where nothing
prospers. The Atlantes (a certain people) are said to curse the rising Sun,
it does so torture them with extreme heat. When the dog star arises, those are
in ill case who dwell in hot Countries toward the East, they are troubled and
terrified. Some take the word Chimrine here rendered blackness, for those (...)
mentioned by the Prophets, those Chimney-Chaplains of the Heathen idols, and so
render it thus, Let the Priests of the day terrify it; that is, Let those who
used to observe and distinguish days, note it for a terrible day; other^
understand it of the noonday devils, that should vex people on that day with
hellish he^^^^ and fures: the ^^lgar Latin has it thus, Let, Hinc forsan
tenebra Cimmeria.
as it were, the b^ternesse^ of the day terrify it; and to the (...) the
Chaldee Paraphrast. Job still rises in his discourse, making use of many
poetical figures, and tragical phrases, picked out for the purpose.

Verse 6. As for that night, let darkness seize upon it] Having spent his
spleen upon the day, he now vents himself upon the night, according to that
division verse 3. As for that night of mine unhappy conception or birth, let
tenebrosus turbo (as the Vulgar here has it) Caligo perpetua and inufitata.
Mercer.
a dark tempest, or a tempestuous darkness grasp it, or invade it: let it be
as dark as pitch, by a darkness superadded to its natural darkness.

Let it not be joined unto the days of the yeare] Let nature quite disclaim
it, and disjoint it from the day following; let it not be reckoned as any part
of time, that measure of all our motions. Some render it, Ne gaudeat inter
dies, Let it not rejoice it self among the days of the year, as one of them.
The night has glory by union with the day: this he wishes taken from it.
Disunion and division is a curse: and the number of two has been accounted
accursed, because it was the first that departed from unity.

And let it not come into the number of months] Drus.
Deleatur e calendario, let it be razed out of the Calendar, and not have any
place in the computation of time. The Hebrews call the Moon and a Month by the
same Name; because the Moon is renewed every month. Sic (...) mensis and (...)
luna.


Verse 7. Lo let that night be solitary] And so consequently sorrowful; for
alonenesse is comfortless, and optimum solatium sodalitium. There is a
desirable solitariness: such as was that of Isaac, Genesis 24.63. of Jacob, Genesis
32.24. of Christ, Mark 1. of Peter, Acts 10.9. to talk with God and with
themselves. But usually to sit solitary is a misery, Lam. 1.1. (for Satan is
readiest to assault, when none is by to assist) neither is there a greater tie
to constancy, then the society of Saints. This the Heathen Persecutors
perceived, and therefore banished and confined the Christian Confessors to Isles
and Mines, where they could not come together for mutual edification and
comfort. There is a Woe to him that is alone, and good reason showed for it by
Solomon, Eccles. 4.9, 10, 11, 12. Let no man stye up himself, or affect
solitariness: but make conscience of fellowship in the Gospel, as the
Philippians did from the first day of their conversion to Christ, Phil 1.5.
accounting, that Communion of Saints is a point of practice, as well as an
Article of belief.

And no joyful voice come therein] That is, says One, No pleasing stillness,
(as in other nights there is) to invite the melody of Music. Or, let there be
no merry-meetings, feastings and jollities, as was usual in the night-season.
Let not so much as the voice of the Cock be heard that night (so the Chaldee
here paraphraseth) but the doleful ditties of Screech-owles, and other
inauspicate creatures. Let no traveller, that is then benighted, solace himself
with sweet songs, or Musicians play from house to house, as City-waits do.

Verse 8. Non tam cute, quam cord, Ae hiopici.
Let them curse it, that curse the day] As those atri and tetri Atlantes
(before spoken of) curse the rising-Sun for scorching them; as despairing
persons, and malefactors led to execution, use to curse the time that ever they
were born. The help of all such Job here calls in against the harmless night
he banneth, with so much bitterness. Rob. Bolton his Assize Sermon. 227.
Like as that desperate wretch mentioned by Mr. Bolton, who being upon his
deathbed, albeit he swore as fast and as furiously as he could; yet desired he
the standers by to help him with oaths, and to swear for him. Tremellius here
thinks, that Job calls to the stars and winds to help him curse. See his
translation of the Text, and his Notes thereon.

Who are ready to raise up their mourning] Whether they be those mercenary
mourners mentioned elsewhere, Jer. 9.17, 18, 20.
which, for hire, are wont at Funerals with doleful execrations to lament the
day of their Benefactors death; crying out, Oh the day! alas for the day! 2
Chro. 35.25. Amos 5.16.
oh that ever such a day came! See Ezekiel. 30.2. Or else those that really mourn
for their deceased friends; and yearly, as often as the day returns, they renew
their mourning. These are called upon by Job totos sacco^deplere, to pour out
their utmost lamentations and execrations upon this his night. Concerning the
word Leviathan, here rendered mourning, whether it be taken for the Sea-Dragon,
or the Devil, and what it is to raise him up, and why they cursed him that are
ready to do so, with a prepared and meditated active readiness, if I should go
about to show the Reader, Lcc. Com. 478.
with the several opinions of Interpreters, I should not only tire him out,
but also danger doing as that Vicar of Ausborough did, mentioned by Johannes
Manlius: This Doctor of Divinity (for so he was) having read at Tubinga certain
Lectures upon Job, at the end of his last Lecture said, that both Job and
himself were very glad to be rid of one another: For as he understood little or
nothing of Jobs meaning, so Job seemed to him to be more tormented with his
enarrations, then ever he had been with all his own ulcers. Let them that have
a mind, consult the Commentators here.

Verse 9. Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark] If the stars of
its twilight be dark, how great is that darkness? Job would not have this
night to have light of stars, or hope of day-dawn, hope of better, or place
of worse. And this part of the curse he reserveth to the last place, as worse
then any of the former Semblably, that judgment of Pining away in their
iniquity, is the last that God denounces, Lev. 26.39. after those other dismal
ones there to befall the disobedient. And that Rev. 22.11, Let him that is
filthy be filthy still, is the last, but not the least (of those that befall in
this life) threatened in all the New Testament.

Let it look for light, but have none] Heb. but none. Loss of expectation is a
great loss: Esau found it so: and the mother of Sisera, Judge. 5.28. and those
shall once, that come knocking and bouncing at heaven gates, with Lord, Lord,
open unto us, and shall hear, Depart ye. The hopes of the wicked fail them when
at highest: whereas the Saints find that comfort in extremity which they durst
not expect: their light shall rise in obscurity, Esaias 58.10. it shall shine
more and more unto the perfect day, Prove 4.18.

Let it no^ see the dawning of the day.] Heb. The eyelids of the morning; that
is, the first breakings of light, the morning rays or beams peeping abroad.
These this night must never see. Heaven is a nightlesse day, Hell a daylesse
night. (...)
Fire there is, but without light: it burns, but shines not to those
Reprobates who are in tenebras ex ten^bris infeliciter exclusi, infelicius
excludendi; thrust into outer darkness, a darkness beyond a darkness, as the
dungeon is beyond the prison, Matthew. 8.12.

Verse 10. Because it shut not up the doors of my mothers womb] Lest his curse
should seem causeless, and he mad without reason, he tells you here, why he
thus powered out his passion; and complains so heavily against the day of his
birth, and night of his conception, which yet were harmless, and had not
deserved to be thus charged, cursed. Because it shut not up, etc. But how could
the night do that? Is it not of God alone to shut or open the womb, Gen 20.18.
and 29.31.? And was it not he that took David thence? Psalm. 18.23. This Job
could tell well enough at another time, but now he is quite out of all reason;
beating himself with his passions, as the Lion does with his own tail: yea,
like some sullen bird in a cage, he could almost find in his heart to beat
himself to death. We use to say, -- Res est ingeniosa dolor, Grief is an
ingenious thing; yet it makes a man foolish (the excess of it) as it did Job
here: yea it makes a wise man mad as Solomon says of Oppression, Eccles. 7.7.
and we see it exemplified in Job, especially if the words be thus read, as they
may, Because he (that is, God) shut not up the doors etc.

Nor ^id sorrow from mine eyes.] In Scripture, to see good or evil, is to feel
it, Psalm. 34.12. Jer. 17.6. Isa. 65.16. Job. 33.17. He means, that he had
mist those evils which now he met with since his coming into the world, if
those doors, being shut, had shut him out of the world. Man is no sooner born,
then born to trouble, Job 5.7. yea, man that is born (or conceived) of a woman
is of few days, and full of trouble: Job 14.1.
Miserable he is even so soon as he is warm in the womb, as David phraseth it,
Psalm. 51.5. If he live to see the light, he comes crying into the world, and an
untimely birth may be better then he, Eccles. 5.3. The Hebrews call him Enosh,
that is, sorryman; Psalm. 3.21.
or doleful, miserable, and desperately diseased man, whose living is but to
lie a dying. The Greeks, when they would set forth one extremely wretched, they
call him (...) thrice-a-men, that is, thrice miserable. And, What is man, faith
Seneca? He answers, Marbidum, pu^re, cassum, a fletu vitam auspicatum: Ad
Mar. cap. 11.
a diseased, rotten, empty thing, beginning his life with tears; as if he wept
to think upon what a shore of trouble he is landed, or rather, into what a sea
of sorrows he is lanching, not unlike the St^eights of Magellan, a sea of that
nature, say Geographers, that which way soever a man bend his course, he shall
be sure to have the wind against him.

Verse 11. Why dyed I not from the womb? why did not I give up the Ghost etc.]
Why was I not forthwith carried ab utero ad urnam? from the womb to the tomb,
from the birth to the burial? True it is, that infants have the seed of death
in them, and the principle of corruption, Romans 5.14. Every one (say some
Chymicks) has his own balsame within him; his own bane it is sure that he
has. But why should Job be so weary of life, and so wish to be rid of it? Is
not life a great mercy? Does not the Philosopher affirm, that a pismire
excels the heavens in dignity, Eccl. 9.4.
because it is a living creature? Says not the Scripture, that a living dog is
better then a dead Lion? and why is living man sorrowful, a man for the
punishment of his sin? Lam. 3.39. q. d. Let him be never so much punished, it
is for his sin; and if a midst all, he be yet a living man, and have his life
spared, he need not be so over-sorrowful, and to make such an outcry, and a
wishing himself out of the world, as Job here does. Life, alas, in its utmost
extent, is but a little spot of time between two eternities before and after;
but it is a great consequence, and given us for this end, 2 Pet. 2.11.
that glory may be begun in grace, and we have a further and further entrance
here into the Kingdom of heaven, as Peter says. This, if Job had seriously
and sedately considered (but now alas, as in a hot sever, all the humors were
on an hurry) he would rather have done, as they say, Themistocles did; who
though he lived till he was about 107 years of age; yet when he came to dye, he
was grieved upon this ground, Now I am to dye, said he, when I begin to be
wise.

Verse 12. Why did the knees prevent me?] Why did the over-officious Midwife
lay me on her lap, and not let me alone to perish by my fatal helplessness?
Man is a poor shiftlesse creature; and Pliny railes at nature for producing him
so forlorn, naked, and unable to help himself; but he knew not that this was a
fruit of sin. Tully indeed could say, (whether he believed himself therein, I
know not) Cum primum nascimur, in omni continuo pravitate versamur, as soon as
we are borne, we are head and ears all over in wickedness: but Pliny was not
so persuaded, as I have elswehere showed.

Or why the breasts that I should suck?] Why did not my mother turn tygresse,
and cast me out when new born? Why was she not cruel like the Ostriches in the
wilderness, Lam. 4.3.
that refuse to give suck to their young ones? Rather we may ask, why does Job
out of his deepest discontent, think much of such a mercy; and not rather
bless God, first, for filling two such bottles with milk for him, ready
against he came into the world? and then, for giving his mother an heart to
suckle him, which some nice or unnatural women will not, being therein worse
then those Sea Monsters, Lam. 4.3. that succor their young? The Heathens
called their Ceres (Queen of plenty) Mammosam, as the Nurse of all living
creatures: And there are that derive Gods Name Shaddai from Shad a dug: because
as he opens the hand, so he draws out the breast to every living thing. And
for his Saints, they may suck and be satisfied with the full-strutting breasts
of his consolations, the two Testaments, Isai. 66.11. And whatever Job now
(under an heavy temptation, which, like lead, sunk downward, and carried his
soul with it) may mis-judge, they may sit and sing thankfully with David, Lord
thou (and not the midwife) art He that took me out of the womb; thou (and not
my mother) keptst me in safety when I hung upon the breasts: neither then only,
but afterward, for puerilitas est periculorum pelagus, and the Preserver of
men keeps us still from a thousand deaths and dangers. And is this matter of
complaint, and not rather of thankfulness?

Verse 13. For now should I have lien still, and been quiet] Why, but is it not
better to be preserved in salt, then to putrify in sugar? to be emptied from
vessel to vessel, then to be at ease, and so to settle on the lees? Jer. 48.11.
to be tumbled up and down, as fishes are in the streams of Jordan, then to
perish in the dead sea? It is not always (if at all) an happiness to lie
still and to be quiet: Life consists in action; Isa. 38.16.
and in all these things is the life of my spirit, says good Hezekiah, who had
been in deaths hands (where Job so much desired to be) and could therefore
make a better judgment. What haste then was there of his lying still, and being
quiet? say that he were assured of his salvation (for else death had been but a
trap-door to eternal torments) was there nothing more to be done, but taking
present possession? nothing to be suffered with Christ, Romans 8.17
or ere we come to be glorified with him? Ought not he himself first to have
suffered, and then to have entered into his glory? Luke 24.26. And ought not we
to be conformed to his image (in sufferings also) that he might be the
firstborn among many brethren? Romans 8.29. Let us run with patience (running is
active, and patience passive) the ^ace that is set before us, looking unto
Jesus, etc. and looking off our present troubles (as the word there imports)
which while Job beheld over-wishtly, (...). Heb. 12.2.
and was more sensible of then was meet, he brake out in this fort, and showed
himself too much a man Let us do up our work, and then God will send us to head
all in good time, Isa. 57.2. Rev. 14.13.

Verse 14. With Kings and Counselors of the earth] g. d. Those that here have
been most negotious, and (as the Grandees of the earth) have had greatest
matters in hand, with those should I have been coupled in the grave, (...).
that Congregation-house of all living, as it is called, Job 30.23. That long,
or old home. Eccles. 12.5. Heaven is called the Congregation-house of Gods
first, born, Heb. 12.23. and their house not made with hand, 2 Cor. 5.1. But
not many Kings or Nobles mee^e here. 1 Cor. 1.26. because strait is the gate,
and narrow the way that leads to it: there must be stripping and stooping,
which great men cannot frame to. It was a poor comfort to Hen. 8. to be told
upon his deathbed, that he should now go to the place of Kings: And a small
commendation to Hen. 2. The Spanish Brier was wone to say, there were but few
Princes in hell: for why? because there were but few in all. Daniels hist. 111.
that some sew hours before he died, seeing a list of their names who had
conspired against him, and finding therein two of his own sons, he fell into a
grievous passion, both cursing his sons, and the day wherein himself was born;
and in that distemperature, departed the world, which himself had so often
distempered. He went indeed to his grave, and slept with his fathers; yea, he
was royally interred under a stately Monument, meant here (happily) by building
desolate places for themselves: Absalom had erected a pillar for this purpose;
and the Egyptian Kings their Pyramides, ^o perpetuate their memories. Confer
Ezekiel. 26.20. With these, Job, had he died betime, or never seen the light,
might have been fellowed: for death is the only King, against whom there is no
rising up, Prove. 30.31. and the mortal fithe is master of the royal Scepter,
mowing down the lilies of the crown, Sceptra ligonibus aquat.
as well as the grass of the field.

Verse 15. Or with Princes that had gold] great store of it. Petrarch reports
of Pope John 22 that his heirs found in his coffers no less then 250 tuns of
gold. Boniface the eighth taken prisoner and plundered by the command of Philip
the Fair, King of France, had as much gold carried away out of his Palace, as
all the Kings of Europe received for one years revenue from their subjects,
together with their crown-land. What a Mass of Treasure had Cardinal Wolsey
gotten here? and before him Cardinal Beauford, who when he saw that he must
needs die, and that his riches could not reprieve him till a further time,
asked, Fox Mart. 925.
why should I die being so rich? fie, will not death be hired? will money do
nothing? The Cardinal Sylberperger took so great a pleasure in money, that when
he was grievously tormented with the gout, his only remedy to ease the pain,
was to have a basin full of gold set before him, into which he would put his
lame hands, turning the gold upside-down. Of Nugas the Scythian Monarch it is
storied, that when Michael Paleologus the Greek Emperor sent him many rich
ornaments for a present, Pachymer hist. l. 5.
he asked whether they could drive away calamities, diseases and death? this
because they could not do, he slighted them. These Princes that had gold, and
filled their houses with silver, what would not they have given to have bought
off death? but riches avail not in the day of wrath: it is righteousness only
that delivers from death, Prove. 11.4. Thrice happy then are they who are rich
to God, as our Savior phraseth it, who have the Almighty to be their gold, and
who have silver of strength, as Eliphaz. speaks, chap. 22.25.

Who filled their houses with silver] That is, their graves, say some: called
the dead men's houses, chap. 17.13. The Jews call the burying-place,
Beth-chajin, the house of the living: and they used not only to adorn their
sepulchers richly, but also to put their wealth into the grave with them.
Josephus says that Hircanus found in David's sepulcher three thousand talents.
And Ier. 8.1. Lib. 13. Antiq. cap. 15. and (...) cap. 11.
God threatens that the Chaldeans shall bring out the boxes of the Kings of
Judah, and of his Princes, -- out of their graves, as searching there for hid
treasure; so some conceive. Sure it is, Josephm.
that in the siege of Jerusalem, under Ve^p^sian, there was gold found in the
entrails of a Jew that was slain, which caused above twenty thousand of them
to be ripped up.

Verse 16. Or as an hidden and untimely birth I had nor been] As an abortive or
miscarrying Embry^ that falls from the mother, as untimely fruit falls off
from the tree. See R^v 6.3. Hidden. it is called, because cast a de^ as an
unsightly spectacle, that comes in with vanity, and departs in darknesses,
and his name is covered with darkness, Eccles. 6.4. J^^ could have wis^ e^^ome
way or other never to have been, rather then to have been in so calamitous a^
condition: and herein he linned, Job. 3.6.
no doubt, for that (...) as of the flesh is flesh.

As infants w^ ch^rever ^aw the ^ight] but were still-born, as we call them.
The word rendered infants, is taken from a word that signifies to (...), ^ee
Job 16.15. for children in the womb are compassed about with pollution; and the
first shee^ or blanket wherewith they are covered, is woven of sin, shame,
blood, and filth, Ezekiel. 16.4.6.

Verse 17. There the wicked cease from troubling] Here they are restless, as
being acted and agitated by the devil, who being a discontented, turbulent
creature, makes ado in the world, and sets his ^mps awork to do mischief,
and to vex others. (...)
The word here rendered wicked signifies vexatious persons, that worry and
weary out others, molestuous and mischievous: In the grave they shall cease
from so doing. That was a strange mind of our Edward the first, who adjured his
Son and Nobles, that if he died in his journey into Scotland, they should carry
his corpse with them about Scotland, and not suffer it to be interred, till they
had absolutely subdued the Country. This was a deure more Martial then
Christian, says the ^hronicler, Daniels hist. 201.
showing a mind so bent to the world, as he would not make an end when he had
^one with^^t, but de^greth his travel beyond his life.

An (...)] Hence some Heathens also have counted mortality a mercy and some of
them appointed contrary ceremonies to those now in use; for they brought their
friends into the world with mournful obsequies, but they carried them out or
the world with joyful exequies, Plotin. ap Aug. de C.D.l 9 c. 10 Quntil. Inst.
lib. 5 H^^ol. l. 5. Va^. Max.
all sorts of sports and pastimes, because then they conceived they were at
rest, and out o^ gunshot.

Verse 18. There the (...)] or (...) as do their cruel creditors, and hard
taskmasters. There, that is in the state of the dead, whether by land or sea,
the (...), or (...) the miserable captives ^est, such as were those poor
Christians, shut up so close (by Barb^rus^a the Turkish General returning
toward Constantinople) under hatches among the excrements of nature, that all
the way as he went, Turk. hist. 750.
almost every hour, some of them were cast dead overboard. Such were many of
the Martyrs kept fast shut up ^n ^ollards Tower, in the Bishop of London:
cole-house, a dark and ugly prison, said Mr. Philpot, as any is about London:
but I thank the Lord, I am not alone, but have six other faithful companions,
who in our darkness, do lightsomely sing Psalms and praises to God for his
great goodness, Acts and Mon. 1669, 1670.
but especially for this that I am so near the apprehension of eternal bliss:
God forgive me mine unthankfulness and unworthiness of so great glory. What
pitiful hard usage Gods poor prisoners met with in the late troubles, at
Oxford especially (from which death God graciously delivered me when I was in
their hands) and in the Western parts; page 38.
see Mr. R^nas Sermon called J^b in the West, where he compares the enemies
cruelty to that of the American Cann^bals, who, when they take a prisoner, seed
upon him alive, and by degrees, to the unutterable aggravation of his horror
and torment.

They hear not the ^ice of the oppressors] Their harsh and hard speeches, Jude
15. that were as a murdering weapon in the poor prisoners bones, Psalm. 42.10.
Send me back to my frogs and toads again, where I may pray for you conversion,
said one of the Martyrs to his rai^^g adversaries. Art thou come thou villain?
how dare thou look me in the face for shame, said S^even G^r^iner to Dr.
Taylo^ the Martyr^ who told him his own freely, Acts and Mon.
but fairly; for the spirit of grace is (...) Est autem Saran^ poctus (...),
says Luthex, the devil and his agents are bitter railers, fetching their
words as far as hell, to brea^ the hearts of Gods prisoners. Psalm 69.20. But
besides that they have their cordial of a good conscience by them, 2 Cor.
1.12. in the gr^ve they hear not the voice of the oppressor, nor the barking
of these dead dogs any more.

Verse 19. The small and the great are there] In Calvary are sculls of all
sizes, say the Hebrews, Stat sun cuique dies. It is appointed for all once to
die, Virg. Aeneid, lib. 10.
be they great or small, low or high, Mors sceptra liganibus aequat, death
makes no difference: Kings and captives, Lords and losels come then under an
equal parity: death takes away all distinctions. William the Conquerours corpse
lay unburied three days; his interment was hindered by one that claimed the
ground to be his, Daniel.
King Stephen was interred at Fever sham Monastery; but since, Speed. 498.
his body for the gain of the lead, wherein it was coffined, was cast into the
river, where at length it rested, as did likewise the dead corpse of Edward the
fifth, and his brother smothered in, Speed 935.
the Tower by Richard the third, and cast into a place called the black deeps
at the Thames mouth.

The servant is free from his Master] Servant is a name of office, he is not
his own to dispose of, but the masters instrument, says Aristotle, and wholly
his, till he please to manumit him; if he do not, yet death will, and by taking
away his life, give him his liberty: his body rests from all servile offices
for a season howsoever: and if with good will he has done service as to the
Lord, and not to men; he shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance,
even a child's part; Colos. 4.24.

Verse 20. Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery?] Job has not
done yet, though he had said more then enough of this matter; but for want of
the oil of joy and gladness, his doors move not without creaking, his lips
(like rusty hinges) open not without murmuring and complaining: Good therefore
is that counsel given by David, Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; take up in
time, before it has wholly leavened and sowred you: fret not thy self in any
wise to do evil. Psalm. 37.8.
He shall not choose but do evil who is sick of the fret. David had the sad
experience of this, when he had carted the Ark, and thereupon God had made a
breach upon Vzzah: David was displeased, says the Text: and how untowardly
spoke he, as if the fault were more in God then in himself; though afterward
he came to a sight of his own error, 1 Chronicles. 13.11. with 15.2. And so did Job,
no doubt, when come to himself: but here he proceeds to express his
peevishness and impatience, yea, against God himself (though not by name,
forsan sese cohibens -- ob bonae mentis reliquias, says Mercer, out of his
good respect to God, which he still retained:) and calls for a reason, why the
miserable should be condemned to live, since death would be much more welcome
to them. How apt are men to think there is no reason for that for which they
can see no reason?

Verse 21. Which long for death, and it comes not] The bitter in soul long for
death, those that are in pain or penury, are apt to desire to be dispatched
upon any terms, and would freely pardon them, they say, that would give them
their pasport. But these for most part, consider not the unsupportablenesse of
the wrath to come, that eternity of extremity in hell, that death usually
haleth at the heels of it; so that by death, whereof they are so desirous,
they would but leap out of the drying pan into the fire, as Judas did: they do
as the ass in the fable, who desired to die, that he might be no more beaten:
at post mortem factus est tympanum, but when he was dead, he was made a
drum-head of, and so was ten times more laid on, then ever in his lifetime
before.

And dig for it more then for hid treasures] Covetousness is (...), alldaring,
says an Ancient: and men for love of wealth, will dig to hell, light a candle
at the devil, as they say: With such an eagerness of desire do some (that have
little reason for it, all things reckoned) long and labor after death, not to
be rid of sin, or to be with Christ, as Phil. 1.23. but to be freed from
misery incumbent or impendent. Thus Cato (having first read Plato's book of the
souls immortality) laid violent hands on himself, that he might not fall into
the hands of the conqueror. Thus Adrian the Emperor having lain long sick (and
could get no help by Physicians, but was the worse for them, (...)
as he complained at his death) would gladly have slain himself, if those
about him would have suffered it. It is said that Severianus. whom this
Emperor injuriously put to death, wished of God, at Adrianus, quamvis mortem
obire percupiat, tamen non possit, that Adrian might desire to die, and not be
able, or find opportunity. There is an Epistle of his extant, says the
Historian, wherein is set forth, what a misery it is to desire to die, Dio
Cass. in Adrian.
and yet to be denied it. This was the case of those Popelings, Rev. 9.6. And
in particular of Roger Bishop of Salisbury in King Stevens time; who, through
long and strait imprisonment, was brought to that evil pass, ^t vivere
notuerit, mori nescierit, live he would not, and yet die he could not. This is
a very typicall-hell, and a fore-taste of eternal torment.

Verse 22. Which rejoice exceedingly] Joy till they skip again, so Broughton
renders it. Strange, that any should be so glad of death that last enemy, that
slaughter-man of nature, and harbinger of hell to the ungodly! but this the
devil hides from them, till he has them where he would have, and whence there
is no redemption. What was it else that moved Augustus at his death to call for
a Pl^udite; or that made Julian the Apostate to die so confidently; and many
now-adayes that have little reason for it to be so prodigal of their lives,
and seemingly fond of death? Is it not because they are fearfully blinded by
the god of this present world, who holds his black hand before their eyes, 2.
Cor. 4.4.
left they should see the evil consequents of death, and be saved? which
because they do not, what do they else but rejoice exceedingly (or with
exultation, as the word here signifies) in their woeful bondage, and go
dancing to hell in their bolts, not so much as desiring deliverance. A man that
is to be hanged next day, may dream overnight he shall be set free; nay, that
he shall be a King, and rejoice therein accordingly: but the end of such joy
is heaviness.

Verse 23. Why is light given to a man whose way is hid?] i.e. Why is the light
of life continued to him who is in a maze or labyrinth of miseries, whereof he
can see no cause, and whereout he can descry no issue? no hope at all appears
of ever either mending or ending. Therefore Vale lumen amicum, as he in Saint
Hierome said, sweet light adieu; Quin morere ut merita es, as she in the Poet,
Be thine own deaths-man. Seneca counts it a mercy to a man in misery, that he
may by laying hands on himself, set out his life when he will; and this he
calls valor and manhood. But we have no so learned Christ, neither may we
leave our station till called for by our Captain, but must stand to our arms,
and as good Soldiers of Jesus Christ, suffer hardship, 2 Timothy 2.4. His word to
us is the same as the Kings was to his Son the Black-Prince, Speed.
either vanquish or dye: and as she in the story said to her son when she gave
him his Target, See that thou either bring this back with thee, or else be thou
brought back dead upon it out of the battle. (...)
It troubled Job that he could not see his way, and that God had hedged him in,
viz. with a thorn-hedge of afflictions, Lam. 3.7, 9. Hos. 2.6. so that he could
find no way out. But what if he could not, nor any man alive? yet the Lord
knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations, 2 Pet. 2.9. He has his
way in the whirlewind, and his judgments are a great deep, Psalm. 36.6.
Sometimes secret they are, but ever just. Surely it had been more meet for
Job to have said unto God, That which I see not, teach thou me, etc. yea, Job.
34.31.
in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, have I waited for thee; the desire of my
soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee, Isa. 26.8.

Verse 24. For my sighing comes before I eat] It comes unsent for, as evil
weather uses to do, and most unseasonably surprizeth me at my repast; I mingle
my meat with my tears, with every bit of bread I have a morsel of sorrows ^
and I mingle my drink with weeping, Psalm. 102.9. though indeed Jobs was not so
much a shower of tears, as a storm of sighs, and a volly of roarings,
betokening extremity of grief, such as was beyond tears, and vented it self
as the noise of many waters; for my roarings says he, are poured out like
water. I am as hungry as a Lion roaring on his prey, and as violent as the
Torrents ranging the fields; and yet I neither have leisure nor lift to eat my
bread: as loath to prolong such a troublesome life, but that I must, or be
guilty of self-murder. Mr Fox reports of Mr. John Glover, that not long after
his conversion, upon a mistake of the sense of that text, Heb. 6.5, 6. he was
strongly conceited, that he had fallen into the unpardonable sin, and must
necessarily therefore be damned: and in that intolerable grief of mind,
although he neither had not could have any joy of his meat, yet was he
compelled to eat against his appetite, to the end, to defer the time of his
damnation so long as he might. Acts and Mon. 1552.
Now who can tell how near Jobs case might come to this, fith the devil was
both Author and Actor in a great part of both these Tragicomedies?

Verse 25. For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me] Heb. I feared
a fear, and it came upon me. Had Job been wicked, this had been no wander,
Prove. 10.24. Job 15.21. Or had his fear been sinful, it had been l^sse pity.
Prove. 29.25. John. 11.48, for why should he, by a painful (...), suffer before
he needed? and send for his crosses before they came? A good man should (...)
all (and so consequently fearful) in nothing, ^^il. 4.6. he should hope the
best, and beat bravely (...), says Demosthenes, whatever God sends. The
Epicunts held, that a good man might be cheerful under whatsoever miseries: 1.
Ex prateritarum voluptatum recordatione. Cic. de finib. lib. 2.
In consideration of honesty and integrity. 2. In consideration of those
pleasu^es and to (...) that formerly he had enjoyed, and now cheared up himself
with. Of neither of these was Job to seek: But whereas it might be said unto
him, Is it fit for thee, who have hitherto been so happy, now to take on so
heavily, because thus and thus afflicted? Truly, says he, I was never so happy
as you took me for; because (considering how moveable and mutable all outward
things are) I always feared lest I should out live my prosperity: that which
now also is unhappily befallen me. Sylla had been happy, si eundem and vinc^ndi
and (...) f^cisset, says One: that i^, if he had made an end of conquering and
of living together: but that he did not. In him and many others it has
appeared, that mortality is but the stage of mutability. This, holy Job had often
forecasted with himself; and though in his passion he here alled^^ it as a
reason why he took no comfort in his meat etc. yet, in true account, it could
be no grief unto him, nor offense of heart (as she once said to David, 1 Samuel
25.31.) since it was a fear of wisdom and caution; a fear of the head, and no^
of the heart; a fear of diligence, and not of diffidence.

Verse 26. I was not in safety] i.e. I counted not my self simply the safer and
happier man, because of creature comforts: but knowing their uncertainty, I
held at a distance, and hung loose to them all.

Neither had I rest] I set not up my rest here, as did Nebuchadnezzar, Dam.
4.4. and that rich fool, Luke 12.10 and the purple whore, who sits and
says, I shall see no sorrow. Once indeed, Job said, (but not so well) I shall
di^ in my ^est, and multiply my days at the sand: Chap. 29.18. And so (by a
like (...), which was quickly confuted) David said in his prosperity, I shall
never be moved, Psalm. 10.6, 7. But for the main and the most part, Job was
otherwise minded. A godly man may be master of, and busied about these
palterments of this present world, but not satisfied in them as adequate
objects: he looks upon them all, in their greatest luster, as Hir^^ did on the
Cities Solomon had given him, which he called Ch^^ul, that is, a land of dirt.
He minds the things above, most of all.

Yet trouble came.] Although I ever kept my self within the bounds of humility
and modesty, and so took the safest and wisest course to secure that I had, and
to gain a settled estate; yet all is gone, and I am left a mirror of misery:
What can any one make of his? This is a riddle to me: here I am gravelled and
benighted.

CHAP. IV. Verse 1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite.]
THen, when Job had laid about him in this sort: and, giving his tongue too
much liberty to lash out, had uttered words little better then blasphemous and
contumelious against God: Then Eliphaz, Temanites ille, the firstborn of Esau,
Genesis 36.
(says R. Solomon) brought up in the bosom of Isaac, and so inured to
Revelations from on high. Others think he descended of Teman, nephew to Esau
etc. A man of great wisdom he was, and of grave discourse: One that could
speak his mind fitly, and durst do it freely. He seems to have been (...) chief
of the three for age and authority, and therefore begins: pretending to be
moved thereunto by zeal for Gods glory, not a little impaired by Jobs
impatiency savouring of hypocrisy, and arguing (...) ficto fucataque card
fuisse, that he had been little better then a dissembler. A causeless and
uncharitable charge, enough to have driven him into desperation. The Rabbines
speak so well of Jobs three friends, that they use to say in a Proverb, Ba^a
bathra Perech 1o.
Let a man either get him such friends as Job had, or else get him out of the
world, (like as Chrysippus was wont to say, Aut mentem, aut restim comparandam)
But Gregory the great says, that these three, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar do
fitly set forth heretics, who begin to speak smoothly at first, as if they
meant no hurt to him to whom they speak, but only good, to purchase his
benevolous attention, but soon come to speak words which much hurt the hearer,
and greatly trouble him etc.

Verse 2. If we assay to commune with thee] Or may we assay to commune with
thee? Art thou in case to be counseled? and will not an essay to this purpose
further trouble thy patience and distemper thee? the ear which tastes words
(as the mouth does meat) if filled with choler, Bafil. orat. 12.
can relish no comfort: and the easiest medicines, on mildest waters, are
troublesome to sore eyes. Honey causes pain to exulcerate parts, though in it
self it be sweet and medicinal: children, though at other times they like it
and (...) in, Alex. Aphrod. problem.
yet they will not endure to have it come near their lips, when they have the
(...) some patients are mad against their medicines: and some hearers rage at a
reprob^^ Eliph^^^ knew not but that Job might do as much, and that having newly
been in a fearful fit of passion, he might fall into another, as Jonas did;
the ^rifice of his corruption being not yet closed up by repentance: Hence this
preamble by way of friendly insinuation. The like art uses Paul with Philemon,
and with the Corinthian often.

But who can withold himself from speaking?] Who that has any piety toward
God, or pity to his offending friend? we use to say, He that receives a
courtesy sell^th his liberty; but true love will not be tongue-tied. Our
Saviors mouth was not stopped with all the good cheer that Simon the leper
made him, Luke 7. neither entertained he the Pharisees with fewer menaces, then
they did him eft-soons, with messes of meat. Job had been doubtless very
friendly to his friends, who yet spare him not: and had they done it aright
with the meekness of wisdom, they had showed themselves friends indeed,
there being not a better office or evidence of love then this, Lev. 19.17.
Friends, as Bees, are killed with the honey of flattery, but quickened with the
vinegar of reproof, so it be well managed. The Eagle, though she loves her
young ones dearly, yet she pricketh and beats them out of the nest when they
are ready for flight.

Verse 3. Behold thou have instructed many] sc. to do each days duty with
Christian diligence, Tertui.
and to bear each days crosses with Christian patience, thou have don't well:
But how comes it now to^ pass quod dicta factis erubescant, that thy present
doings shame thy former saying? and that (as it was noted of Demosthenes the
Orator) thou art better at praising of virtue, then at practicing of it? Turpe
est Doctors etc. Sanctiores sunt aures plebis quam corda sac^rdotum. Hilar.
Should not the Physician first heal himself? and ought not the preachers word
be Spe^^emur agendo; let our profiting appear to all men, let our lives be a
true transcript of our Sermons. What a shame was it, that Hilary should
complain that the peoples cares were holier then the preachers hearts: and that
Erasmus by a true jest, should be told, that there was more goodness in his
book of the Christian Soldier, then in his bosom! Eliphaz from this ground
would here argue, that Job was little better then an hypocrite; a censure
over-rigid, it being the easiest thing in the world, as a Philosopher observed,
to give good counsel, and the hardest thing to take it. Dr. Preston upon his
deathbed confessed, that now it came to his own turn, he found it somewhat to
do, to practice that which he had often pressed upon others.

And thou have strengthened the weak hands] Loose and lax, feeble and infirm,
through many terrors and troubles: to these thou have spoken words which have
been as sinews to their hands, and as strength to their joints. Job had
comforted the feeble-minded, or the dispirited, the sick at heart, and sinking
under the sense of sin, and fear of wrath, 1. These. ^ 14. This is an harder
work then to raise the dead to life, says Luther: this ^^^^ne of a thousand
can skill of, Job 33.23. he must have feeding lips, and an hea^^^g tongue that
shall do it. O quam hoc non est omu^ um* The Christian Romans were able to do
it; chap. 15.14. And holy Job was both able and apt, for he did it to many.
True goodness is diffusive of it self, and is therefore compared to the most
spreading things, as fire, water, Sun-light; etc.

Verse 4. Thy words have upholden him that was falling] So forcible are right
words, well timed and fitted to the present necessity: they shore up the
tottering, they catch him before he comes to ground, and prevent his fall. This
made Latim^r bless God that ever he came acquainted with that fellow-prisoner
of his, that Angel of God (as he called him) John Bradford; he and Ridley, so
long as they lived, upheld Cranmer by their words and letters; who soon after
fell, to the grief of the godly party, but rose again by repentance. It is
storied of Vrbanus Begius, Mr. Clark in his life.
a famous Dutch Divine, that meeting with Luther at Goburg, he spent a whole
day in conference with him about matters of great moment, of which himself
writes, that he never had a more comfortable day in all his life. The Earl of
Darby's accusation in the Parliament house against Mr. Bradford, was, that he
did mo^e hurt (so he called good, evil) by letters and conferences in prison,
Acts and Mon.
then ever he did when he was abroad by preaching.

Thou have strengthened the feeble knees] That bend and buckle under a
back-burden of afflictions: this was to be like unto God, who does not crush,
but cherish the worm Jacob; he does not break the bruised ^eed, nor quench the
smoking flax: he H^spiseth not the day of small things, nor slighteth the
well meant weaknesses of his upright-hearted people. Now Job as a partaker of
the Divine Nature, resembled God herein, and made it his work to comfort the
abject, to strengthen and straighten those that were bowed down with pains and
pressures, to be eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, chap. 29.15. to
distribute spiritual alms, which is far the best in many respects, as were
easy to instance.

Verse 5. But now it is come upon thee] This is a galling. But hitherto Eliphaz
had commended Job: now he dasheth all, and draws a black line over that he
had spoken once. To commend a man with a But, is a wound in stead of a
commendation, it sounds like that which is said of Naaman, 2 Kings 5.^. he was
an honorable and a valiant man, But a leper, it sprinkleth black upon white,
and so smutteth a man's good name, which is slander in an high degree.

It is come upon thee] What is come? the evil thou fearedst, by thine own
confession, chap. 3.25, 26. Or now it is come to thy turn to act what thou
have taught others.

And thou faintest] Thou art down on all four, most shamefully degenerating
into a faithless pusillanimity, and unbelieving impatiency, to the scandal of
the weak, and scorn of the wicked, Nay, thou art not only in a maze, but in a
rage, so that thy reason seems tired as much as thy strength; thou layest
about thee like an Hercules furens, a man stark mad. See the word used in this
sense, Prove. 26.18 Genesis 47.13.

It touches thee, and thou art troubled] It touches thee, but so tender thou
art, and delicate, that a light touch disquieteth thee: like as some men's
flesh, if but razed with a pin, rankleth strait. Invalidum omne natura
querulum, says Seneca, the weaker any thing is, the more complaintfull.

And thou art troubled] Pitifully put to it, as if utterly undone, because
touched a little; Mira vero constantia! But is this you that were the great
teacher, that were so forward and forth-putting to press others to a patient
and peaceable behavior under Gods hand? should not thy words be made visible
by thine actions? and thy patient mind ma^e known to all men, fith the Lord is
at hand? Hypocrites can talk of duty, as if their tongues did run ^p^n pattens,
they talk by the talent, but act by the ounce, as did those Pharisees Matthew.
23.3. Romans 2.21. that shamed goodness by seeming good. Eliphaz here
reproacheth Job for such an one, as both here and every where, he and his two
companions are too hot and harsh in their censures passed upon him; which God
also gives them the telling of, chap. 42.

Verse 6. Is not this thy fear, thy confidence etc?] Or thy folly, q. d. Is
not thy religion a mere foolery? and have not thou rather acted religion,
play's devotion, and the fear of God, then been serious therein? This was a
most bitter scoff, a cruel shake, and came near his heart. Like as nothing
vexed David more then when they laid his religion in his dish, asking, where is
now thy God? So here. By this alteration that affliction has wrought in thee,
thou may easily see what thou art, viz. a very painted hypocrite: hard
weather shows what health: empty vessels set near the fire, crack quickly. At
the parting way, every dog follows his own Master. Afflictio virum arguit,
etc. Affliction shows a man, it turns the inside outward, the bottom of the
bag upward; bringing that which was at the bottom, to the top: as that stick
cast into the water, made the iron swim, 2 King. 6.6. Does it not appear
(says Eliphaz here) that thou have been merely mercenary, serving God whilst
he prospered thee; and now kicking against him, because he afflicts thee?
See how near this man comes, says Mercer, to that first instigation of Satan,
chap. 1.9. in hoc Satanae factus minister, herein acting the devils part though
unwittingly, as Peter also did, Matthew. 16.22, 23.

The uprightness of thy ways and thy hope?] q. d. Thou have taken to thy
self many fair titles, and made a great flaunt, as if there were none such;
but what is it all come to? Is it any better then a flask, a foppery, a name,
and not a thing? Or if it be a reality, make proof of it. True grace is
operative, and will not lie dormant.

Verse 7. Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent?] Why? that
has many a one, as the world counts and calls perishing; the Righteous
perishes, and no man lays it to heart, Isa. 57.1. And it was given unto the
Beast to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them, Rev. 13.7. So it
seemed to be, though so it never was, Rev. 12.11. The first man that dyed,
dyed for Religion; so early came Martyrdom into the world: and John Baptist
was put to death in prison, without all show of law, right, or reason, as if
God had been nothing aware of any such matter, Acts and Mon.
as that Martyr phrased it. Indeed, if Eliphaz meant it of perishing eternally;
neither Job, nor any one else could produce an instance of a godly man so
perishing; but for temporal miseries, it is sure, that never any out of hell
have met with more then the most holy and harmless heirs of heaven; see Heb.
11. and you will say so. But the Scriptures, happily, were not written when
Eliphaz uttered this speech; howbeit, he might have observed the contrary to
what he here seems to affirm, appealing to Jobs own experience for proof.
And the truth is, if men were so well read as they might, in the story of their
own lives, they might have a Divinity of their own, by noting experiments;
such as that 119 Psalm is in a manner wholly made up of. Remember, says he
here: and the Philosopher says, that experience is nothing else but multiplex
memoria, because of the memory of the same thing often done, arises
experience. Eliphaz therefore, after that he had given Job his turn to search
his experiences, brings forth his own in the next verse.

Verse 8. Even as I have seene] And therefore can boldly say: for what so sure
as sight? See Numb. 11.23. Genesis 34.1, 2. Diligent inspection of a thing, and
deep consideration upon it, makes confidence, which is the fruit of experience.

They that plow iniquity, and sow wickednesse] Here Is plowing and sowing, a
mystical husbandry. Sinners are sore laborers, great pains-takers; they plot
and plow; they sow and reap, they dig and delve, Prove. 16.27. they weave and
spin, Isa. 59.5. They busy their heads, and beat their brains, as hard
students in their black-art: they labor even unto lassitude, Jer. 9.5. Hence
they are called workers of iniquity; (the vulgar renders this text Qui
operantur iniquitatem) and sin is called a work of the flesh. How can those
but work hard in digging descents to hell, who have the devil for their
task-master, who continually spurs them on to a quick dispatch of the deeds
of darkness? Arant, serunt, occant scelera, as the devils hinds and horses,
they drudge night and day, turning up all the corruptions in their hearts and
conveniences in the world, for the effecting of their wicked devises.

And sow wickednesse] Nemo repent fit turpissimus. Sin goes on gradually
(here is first plowing, 2 Timothy 3.13.
and then sowing) wicked men and seducers grow worse and worse, til at length
they are even Satanized; being transformed into sins image, and bereft of all
passive power of awaking out of the snare of the devil, being taken alive by
him at his pleasure, 2 Timothy 2.26.

Reap the same] Not the same day it may be, but too soon to their sorrow,
they receive the guerdon of their sin. Sooner or later, it is sure, he that
sows iniquity, shall reap vanity, Prove. 22.8. Jer. 4.18. As every body has
its shadow, so has every sin its punishment: and many times, the one is so
like the other, that a man may safely say, such a punishment is the product of
such a sin, Gal. 6.7. Men shall reap the same they sow, and good reason. Give
them blood to drink, for they are worthy, Rev. 16.6. God loves to make him a
name amongst men by his Art of Justicing (as One calls it) in that most exact
way of counter-passion, or retaliation: And Adonibezek has got him a fame of
ingenuity, by acknowledging as much, Judge. 1.7.

Verse 9. By the blast of God they perish] He puts himself to no great pain to
punish them: but blows them away as so many dust-heaps: he nods them to
destruction, says the Psalmist, Ps 80.16. he can as easily do it, as bid it to
be done. Sic Caesar Metello. Psalm. 64.1.
If the Lord do but arise, his enemies shall be scattered: and all that hate
him fly before him. If he but put his head out of the windows of heaven, as it
were, and say, Who is on my side, who? all the creatures (who for fear of him
had hid themselves, as worms wriggle into their holes in time of thunder) shall
look out presently, and offer him their service: so that he cannot possibly
want a weapon to tame his rebels, or a way to bring the wicked to condign
punishment. He is Eloah, as he is here called; that is, The puissant One, the
mighty strong God, as Isa. 9.6. before whom all Nations are as the drop of a
bucket, or as the dust of the balance: No more able to stand against him, Isa.
40.15.
then is the glasse-bottle against a Cannon shot; or down-thistle before a
whirlwind. Behold, I will send a blast upon him (says God concerning
Sennacherib, 2 King. 19.7.) and so set him going. So elsewhere, he threatens
to tread down his stoutest enemies, as straw is trodden down to the dunghill.
Neither shall he much trouble himself in doing this: For he shall only spread
forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth, spreads forth his
hands to swim, etc. Isa. 25.11, 12. to signify, that he shall do it with
greatest facility. The motion in swimming is easy, not strong; for strong
violent strokes in the water would rather sink then support. It is said, that
by a look of his out of the pillar of fire and of the cloud, he troubled the
host of the Egyptians, Exodus 14.24. and as the Rocks repelled the boisterous
waves, -- Co^antia frangere, frangunt; so did He the enemies of his people.

By the breath of his nostrils they are consumed.] Heb. By the wind of his
nostrils. This is the same with the former. Only it is conceived, that Eliphaz
here alludeth to the manner of the death of Jobs children by a mighty wind; so
strong as if God himself had breathed it out. By the breath of his mouth He
made the world, Psalm 33.6. and by the same breath can He as soon, and as
easily unmake it again; as he did in the general Deluge, whereunto the
Chaldee Paraphrast holds that Eliphaz here refers: the remembrance of
which standing monument of Gods wrath was fresh and well known when this was
spoken.

Verse 10. The roaring of the Lion etc.] Lest any should think, says an
Interpreter, that the blast of God abovementioned carries away only strawes
and feathers, Mr. Cary^.
light and weak persons into perdition, Eliphaz adds the weightiest and the
strongest, The roaring of a Lion etc. q. d. God by his blast can take away or
break the strongest, the mightiest lion-like men etc. Under the shadow of which
allusions he closely strikes at Job. who was once a great man, a fierce
spoiling Lion in the apprehension of his friends, and yet God brought him down.
Of tyrants and Oppressors compared to Lions, and why, see Nahum 2.11, 12. with
the Note: and Prove. 28.15. with the note. The proverb is, The Lion is not so
fierce, as he is painted. But no words can sufficiently set forth the savage
immanity and cruelty of absurd and wicked men. See that of Nebuchadnezzar
graphically described, Jer. 51.34. He has devoured me, he has crushed me,
he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me up like a dragon, he
has filled his belly with my delicates, he has cast me out.

The teeth of the young Lions are broken] Or, pulled out, that they may no more
devour the flesh, and drink the blood of Gods poor afflicted, that fell into
their str^ng-ones. Thus David had prayed, Psalm. 58.6. and this he had proved,
Psalm. 3.7. Thou have smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek-bone: thou have
broken the teeth of the ungodly. God with his hard and heavy hand had so boxed
and buffeted them; that they spat forth some of their teeth; and for the rest,
they might go seek them in their throat; as Dares that bold champion in Virgil,
(whom when he had been soundly beaten by old Entellus) his fellows led away.

Jactantemque utroque caput, crassumque cru^^em
Ore rejectante^m, st^sque in sanguine dentes.
A just hand of God upon such as exercising regiment without righteousness,
ravin and rend, as Lions greedy of their prey, plucking off the skins of their
poor subjects, and pulling out their teeth; M^c. 3.2.
as Melancthon tells of one Tyrant, who to get great sums of money out of
his people, used to send for them: and if they refused to answer his demands,
he would first knock out one of their teeth, and then another, threatening to
leave them toothlesse.

Verse 11. The old lion perishes for lack of prey] As not being able to hunt,
and get it. Quotidiana and domesticae experimenta hoc docent. Mercer. In Psalm.
30.
The meaning is (says One) that men who reign like Lions, that their children
who equalled them in cruelty, that their wives who surpassed them in insolency,
do end their lives tragically; All this is true for the most part. Eliphaz
speaks of what is usually done, says another, Or he speaks of what God can
easily do at any time: and of what God may justly do at all times: If he
suspend this justice, it is for weighty reasons etc. Some wicked men God
punishes here, says Augustine, lest his Providence, but not all, lest his
Patience and promise of Judgment should be called into question.

Verse 12. Now a thing was secretly brought to me] Heb. was brought to me by
stealth, closely and privily, so as others were nothing aware of it. See Act.
22.9. with 9.7. Saul's companions heard his voice, but not Christ's. By this
vision Eliphaz would convince Job, that none are afflicted but those that have
well deserved it: since the best are defective and blameworthy, though they
should be puriores coelo afflictione facti, as Chrysostom says, as those good
souls were, that prayed Peter out of prison, Acts 12.5. Some are of opinion,
that this vision either came from his fantasy, and so was none: or else, by
an illusion from Satan. But Mercer holds it to have been a true vision from
God; although Eliphaz abuse it in his mis-application thereof to Job, playing
the Sophister, after a sort, whilst he quite changes the state of the
question, which at this time was, Whether we ought to judge of a man's life and
behavior by the greatness of those troubles and miseries that he does suffer?
This vision he describes verbis magnificis and ampu^l^sis, as for me a thing
(or a word) was stolen upon me, or secretly brought to me, etc. But what so
great a secret was this, says Calvin, that God alone is perfectly righteous,
and all men unrighteous in comparison of him? For answer, he calls it a
secret (though it be a plain and evident truth) because few consider it, and
improve it to an humble submission to God, and suffering his judgments. See a
like expression, Psalm. 78.2, 3. etc. I will open my mouth in a parable, which
yet was nothing extraordinary, but Poetically set out. So Psalm. 49.4. The happy
and secure estate of Saints in trouble, is described, and the contrary; which
though an ordinary argument, and often treated of, yet is called the great
wisdom, the dark saying etc.

And mine ear received a little thereof] Nonnihil, pauxillum, quippiam, not all
that it might, but as much as it could, as being but a narrow-mouthed vessel.
Vide ut modeste loquatur, says Mercer; see how modestly the man speaks, not
taking upon him any perfection of knowledge, though he were a man of great
understanding; his ear caught somewhat of that was repealed, and but somewhat.
The best men, whilst here, know but in part: for why? We prophecy but in
part, 1 Cor. 13.9. Such is our weakness, and narrow-heartednesse, that we
cannot take in all of all; no, nor any part of all in the full latitude and
extent of it. The greatest part of that we know, is the least part of that we
know not, says a Father. Hence those modest expressions of some Philosophers,
and others: This only I know, that nothing I know, said Socrates: I know not
so much as this, said another, that I yet know nothing. My greatest knowledge,
said Chytraeus, is to know, that nothing I know. And albeit I am otherwise
ignorant, says another, yet of mine own ignorance I am not ignorant. Not only
in most other things am I to seek, Epist. 119. c. 21
says Austin, but even in the Scriptures (my chief study, and trade of life)
Multo plura nescio quam scio, there are many more things hid from me, then
what I yet understand, John 14.4, 5. Thomas seems to contradict Christ: Austin
thus reconcileth it, they did partly know whither Christ went, but durst not
once believe that they had any such knowledge; they did not know their own
knowledge. The best here can see but Gods back-parts, and live, as Moses. Esaias
saw but his train in the Temple, and the latter end of that too. Eliphaz his
ear caught but the later end, as it were, of a sentence, only that which the
echo resounded, a particle of the whole that was whispered secretly to him.
Howbeit, that he received but a little, was not from neglect of the rest; but
from inability to receive more or to receive it more perfectly.

Verse 13. In thoughts from visions of the night etc.] Or in thoughts of the
visions of the night. It appears by this and other circumstances, that this
vision was no fiction or holy fraud (as some have conceited) to bring Job to a
sight of his sin. Let Papists praise their St. Dominick for his holy
hypocrisy which he taught his Disciples to make use of, to bring people the
better to a good esteem of the faith, and love of virtue. Eliphaz was a better
man, then to deal in such depths of the devil: and with such deliberate
gravity, put a lie upon God. He was really plodding, he was in thoughts, the
word properly signifies branches or bought of trees, which are many, thick,
intertwined, and crossing one another. In the multitude of my perplexed
thoughts within me, says David, thy comforts have refreshed my soul, Psalm
94.19. The same word is rendered vain thoughts, or wavering cogitations, Psalm.
119.113. Such as David's soul hated. Carnal hearts are exchanges, and shops of
vain thoughts, stews of unclean thoughts, slaughter-houses of cruel and
bloody thoughts, a very forge and mint of false, politic, undermining
thoughts: but Eliphaz his thoughts were better busied; his top-thoughts, those
uppermost branches of his soul were concerning God, and the things of his
kingdom: when other men became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish
heart was darkened, he had visions of God. In the night-season, when dead sleep
fell upon others, he slept, but his heart waked, and was free to receive
revelations, and to contemplate of them: or perhaps, he was broad awake at that
time of night, that he might the better converse with God and his own soul.
Abraham had many such sweet visions: Isaac walked out into the fields for the
purpose: Jacob met with God in this manner, both at Bethel, and at Penuel.
Daniel had visions both of the day, and of the night: so had Paul, and other
Apostles. The Monks make long relations of revelations, and apparitions that
they have had. So do the Enthusiasts, and high-attainers; but we are not bound
to believe them. Matthew Paris reports of Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of London,
Anno Dom. 1161. that one night musing of the difference betwixt the King and
Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, he heard a terrible voice, saying, O
Gilberte Foliot, dum revolvis tot and tot, Deus tuus est Ascarot; he taking it
to be the devil, answered boldly, Mentiris demon: Deus meus est Deus Sabbath.
Aeneas in Virgil, is said to have his visions and conferences with his deceased
friends. Satan loves to imitate God in what he can, that he may deceive with
better success: but we have a most sure word of prophecy, and yet a more
glorious light of the Gospel, Heb. 1.2. The promised day star being risen in
our hearts, 1 Pet. 1.19.

Verse 14. Fear came on me, and trembling] Fear in the inward man, and
trembling in the outward. And this is Gods method still; the more he draws
nigh to any man, the more does rottenness enter into his bones, and he is
horribly afraid of Gods judgments, with David; he trembles at his word with
Josiah, that it may be the more efficacious in his soul. Let us have grace
(says the Apostle) whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and
godly fear. For even our God also (and not the God of the Jews only) is a
consuming fire, Heb. 12.28, 29. (...), says Basil: Our King will be served
like himself, served in state: and although he allows us an humble
familiarity, yet he expects our reverentiall fear; acquainted he will be with
us in our walks of obedience; but yet he takes state upon him in his
ordinances, and will be trembled at in the addresses we make unto his Majesty;
he looks we should bring with us a legal faith, and a legal repentance, as
well as an Evangelicall; and that we should work out our salvation with fear
and trembling, Philip. 2.12. Terrors and humiliations prepare and posture the
heart for revelations; never is it right, till a man lie low at Gods feet,
putting his mouth in the dust, and crying out, Isa. 28.
Speak Lord, for thy servant hears: there shall be only fear to make them
understand the hearing: fear met Eliphaz, and made way for the heavenly vision.

Which made all my bones to shake] Heb. the multitude of my bones, or the
number of my bones, how many soever they be, and they are as many (say the
Hebrews) as there are affirmative precepts in the Law. These pillars of my
body shook sore, and threatened a downfall.

-- Gelidusque per ima cucurrit
Ossa tremor. -- Aeneid. 2

Verse 15. Then a spirit passed before my face] Some render it a wind, as a
messenger or forerunner of God near at hand, as 1 Kings 19.11. But better, a
good Angel in some bodily shape, Psalm. 104.4. Luke 24.37. for else, how could
he be seen of Eliphaz, gliding rather then going, as a ship upon the face of
the waters?

The hair of my flesh stood up] Horripilatus sum; In a fright the heart falls
down, the hair stands up; the blood hastening to the heart to relieve it, as
soldiers do to the castle, when all is likely to be lost.

Dirigui, steteruntque comae -- Verse 16. It stood still] As now ready to
speak: an ambulatory voice is hardly heard: The Heavens indeed, are walking
preachers, but then they utter but these three words, Lib. 2. de Arca, cap. 3.
says Hugo, in all Languages, Accipe, Read, Fuge; that is, Receive mercies,
Return duties, Fly offenses, and their just punishments.

But I could not discern the form thereof] Heb. The aspect or countenance. He
was so frighted, that his eye could not do its office distinctly, to discern
the thing that was just before it. It is natural to a man to fear at the sight
of an Angel; what then will wicked men do at the last day, when the Son of man
shall bring all his Angels, not leaving one behind him in heaven? Knowing
therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men: and oh that we could
persuade them!

An image was before mine eyes] But I could not tell what to make of it. It is
not the will of God that man should represent him by an image. The Jews, after
the captivity, Deuteronomy. 4.15, 16
were so far from idolatry, that they would not admit a Carver or Painter
into their City. The Turks will not endure any image, no, not upon their
coins, because of the second Commandment. Varro says, he that first brought
in Imagery (and that is thought to be Ninus King of Babylon) superstitionem
auxit, metum dempsit, increased superstition, and took away fear. The wiser
heathers held, that God was too subtle for sinew or fight to seize upon: and
the Greek Painters, when they would draw the image of their Jupiter in a
Table, they were still mending it, but never ending it; saying, that herein
they showed him to be a god; for that they might begin to paint, but could not
perfect him.

There was silence, and I heard a voice] It was fit there should be silence and
sedatenesse of spirit, when a divine voice was to be heard. Let all the earth
keep silence before God, Hab. 2.20. When the seventh seal was opened, there
was half an hours silence in heaven, Rev. 8.1. What a noise is there in many
men's hearts even whiles they are hearing what the Lord God speaks unto them?
what bargaining, lawing, projecting, running into another world (as men in
dreams do) so that they can tell no more what the preacher said, then the man
in the moon can! Silence is a good preparative to audience; speak Lord, for thy
servant hears: Let the woman (and so the man too) learn in silence. Let
by-thoughts, swarming and humming in our hearts, like the flies of Egypt, be
barred out: let the devil, interrupting us with his suggestions, as the
Pythonisse did Paul and his companions, be haltred up. Let even good thoughts,
if unseasonable and heterogeneall to the work in hand, be turned out of doors;
let us say to them, as Hushai did to Achitophel, thy counsel is good, but not
now; how shall we else hear with attention and affection? how shall we listen
as for life, and hearken diligently with much heed? Isa. 21.7.

Verse 17. Miser, aerumnis et peccatis obnoxious.
Shall mortal man] Sorry sinful man, a very mixture and hodg-podg of dirt and
sin.

Be more just then God?] Or, be just rather then God, as Luke 18.14? This is
the matter of the vision; and it is (says Diodate) a revelation of the
doctrine of the free remission of sins, and of the sinners justification by
grace, through his faith in the promised Mediator. But Eliphaz turns it another
way, and mis-applying it to Job, would there-hence evince, that all his present
sufferings were the proceeds of his own sin, and so from the process of Gods
justice. The truth is, Job had blurted out some words in the former chapter,
that reflected somewhat upon God: he had also bitterly cursed the day and
services of his birth: this latter, if Eliphaz had sharply reproved Job for,
he had done him a friendly good office: But he waves that part, and quae
desperate renitescere posse, relinquit; the other of clearing Gods justice, he
takes up and presses it too far, to prove this unsound position; That
whosoever is greatly afflicted by God, and for a long time together, that man
is to be numbered with the wicked, though no other evidence or witness appear
or speak a word against him: for if he be innocent, how shall God be just that
punishes him? But Eliphaz should have known, that afflictions are of two
sorts, Penal and probationall; these later are not simply for punishment of
men's sins, but for trial and exercise of their graces, to humble them, to
prove them, and to do them good at their latter end, Deuteronomy. 8.16. Wait but till
God have made an end of his work (and we must not judge of Gods works, says
Peter Martyr, ante quintum Actum, before the fifth Act) and we shall see the
effect both just and good. This Job had scarce patience to do, as appears by
sundry passages of his; howbeit he ever preserved high and holy thoughts of
God, neither at any time questioned his justice and purity, or complained of
his dealings with him, and dispensations toward him as unrighteous, though now
and then through the extremity of his pain, the anguish of his spirit, and the
provocation of his friends, some unwary speeches slipped from him.

Shall man be more pure then his maker?] Take man in his prime and pride, in
his best estate, and utmost strength, when, and wherein he is most a man, (...)
Vir a viribus, a man of the first magnitude, of the highest elevation (as one
fitly phraseth it) both in parts, gifts and graces; shall he be more pure then
his Maker? never think it. Man compared with his Maker, has no purity or
righteousness at all, no, not so much as a show or shadow of it: just he may
be, or pure by participation from God, (says Austin) but neither just nor pure
in comparison of God; he surpasses all notion, and surmounteth all creatures,
he has no parallel; so true he is, that all men are liars; so pure, that all
men are filthy; so just, that all men are wicked; so incomparably great and
glorious, that the Angels make their addresses to him with greatest
self-abasement. For why?

Verse 18. Lo he put no trust in his servants, etc.] those meniall, domestic
servants of his, the holy Angels that wait upon him, and are at his hand to do
his will: Servant is a name of office; and they delight rather to be called
Angels, (that is, Messengers) and ministering spirits, then Principalities,
Thrones, Dominions, etc. Now in these God put no trust, he found no such cause
to confide in them, because not perfectly sure and loyal to him, further then
upheld and assisted by himself: the vulgar Latin has it thus, They that
serve him are not stable; that is, the good Angels are not stable by their own
strength, but by Gods stablishing of them to stand when others fell. Hence
Psalm. 68.17. the Angels are called Shinan, as Gods seconds, say some; the
Nobles of that Court, the very next unto him: but others say they are so called
from their changeable state, now taken away by Christ, under whom they are as
an head of government, of influence, of confirmation, but not of Redemption, as
we. Christ, as God, gives them their being, and all their excellencies. As
Mediator also, he makes use of their Ministry, for the safeguard and comfort
of his people.

And his Angels he charged with folly] That is, he spared not the angels that
sinned, as St. Peter expounds it, 2 Pet. 2.4. Their sin is said to be folly,
that is pride and self-confidence. How this folly and madness of theirs
(pravity, the vulgar renders it) shows it self, whither in affecting a
divinity, or in envy stirred up by the Decree of exalting man's nature above
Angels in and by Christ, and appointing them to be good men's guardians, which
office they scorned; or whether their pride appeared by transgressing some
commandments in particular, not expressed, as Adams was, it is hard to say.
Sure it is, that they abode not in the truth, that they kept not their station
etc. and that the good Angels stand, and are out of danger of ever falling, it
is of divine grace. Hence Exodus 25.19. the Cherubims stand upon the Mercy-seat,
and are made of the matter thereof.

Verse 19. How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay] Or how much
more (in reference to the latter part of the preceding verse) may God charge
men with folly and pravity? And how much more ought he to acknowledge, that he
cannot subsist nor stand before Gods judgment (as verse 17) but only by his
gracious pardon and absolution?

That dwell in houses of clay] Periphrasis est hominum, says Mercer: this is a
description of men, as opposed to Angels, those inhabitants of heaven, called
therefore the Angels of Heaven, Matthew. 24.36. Gal. 1.8. the courtiers of that
heavenly Jerusalem, Heb. 12.22. in and with which, it may seem, they were
created: as Christ's soul was in and with his body in the virgins womb, the
same moment. Hence they are also said to be in heaven, when as men and other
things here below are said to be on earth, Matthew. 6.10. on the surface only,
as ready to be shaken off, and as having here no continuing City, Heb. 13.14.
no mansions till they come to heaven, John 14.2. no settled abode: some huts we
have here, rather then houses; (...).
clayie cottages, earthy tabernacles, as Paul after Plato calls men's bodies,
2 Cor. 5.1. And so the most interpreters understand these words of Eliphaz
concerning the body of man (rather then of his house he dwells in here, made up
of clay and dust a little refined and sublimated by art or nature) which is
nothing else but a clod of clay neatly made up. What is man (says Greg.
Nazianzen out of Genesis 2.7. but (...), (...) cinis. Genesis 3.19. Genesis 18.21. Hor.
Carm. l. 4. Od. 7.
soul and soil, breath and body, a puff of wind the one, a pile of dust the
other? no solidity in either. Pulvis and umbra sumus, says the Poet, and
(...), says the Greek Proverb. Man is but an earthen pot. The first man,
Adam, was of the earth earthy, 1 Cor. 15.47. And no better are the best, quos
ex meliore forsan luto finxit Titan, who are made of the finest common mould:
but as the finer the metal, the purer the matter of any glass or earthen
vessel, the more subject it is to break; so are they to die: for why?

Their foundation is in the dust] The house is but weak, and yet the foundation
weaker, terra friabilis, flying, light, unstable, unmovable, dust that is
soon wherried and whirled about with every puff of wind. Hence the Apostle
calls man's body not an house only (in respect of 1. the comely and orderly
workmanship thereof. 2. The soul which inhabiteth it) but a tabernacle which
has no foundation, and is transportative, 2 Cor. 5.1. opposing to it building,
which is firm and stable. Hence David, Omnis Adam est totus Abel, says he.
Verily every man in his best estate (when he is best founded and settled on his
best bottom, when he is under-layd on all sides, and seems set to live) is
altogether vanity, Psalm. 39.5, 12. So Psalm. 144.4. Adam is Abels compeere, or
man is like to vanity; what can he be better, when as

They are crushed before the moth] He says not, before the Lion, but before
the moth. Now what a poor thing is man, that a moth may crush him, that a fly
may choke him, as it did Pope Alexander; that a light bruise on his toe may
kill him, as it did Aemilius Lepidus; Plin. lib. 7. cap. 53.
that a poisoned torch may light him to his long home, as it did the Cardinal
of Lorrain? I have known, says one, death admitted in by a corn on the toe;
and though the hurt were so far off the heart, yet the man died upon it.
Purchase.
Another I knew, who seeming to have conquered the elements, the wide Ocean,
wild wildernsse, wilder beasts, wildest men, hottest climates; after sixteen
years absence, returned home, and died of an hurt in his thumb. Mr. Terry a
great traveller, tells of a Noble man in the great Mogols Court, who sitting
in dalliance with one of his women, had an hair plucked by her from his breast;
this little wound, Lawl. liberty in a Sermon. at Paul's by Edm. Terry. p. 21.
made by that small and unexpected instrument of death, presently festered; and
turning to an incurable Canker, killed him. God needs no bigger a lance then
an hair to kill an Atheist, as this dying man acknowledged. But besides all ill
accidents and casualties from without; look how the garment breeds the moth,
and then the moth eats the garment: so man's own distempered body breeds ill
humors, The New-lander cure. page 23.
they diseases, and these breed death, as one well observes upon this Text. It
is holden for certain, that in every two years, there is such store of ill
humors and excrements engendered in the body, that a vessel of one hundred
ounces will scarce contain them. Ipsa suis augment is vita ad detrimenta
impellitur. says Gregory, and inde deficit unde proficere creditur. Life
wears out by the very meat that maintains it; and every man has his bane
about him.

Verse 20. They are destroyed from morning to evening] Heb. They are beaten to
pieces, as in a mortar, with one sorrow upon another, till the very breath be
beaten out of their bodies at length; and all this from morning to evening, all
the day long, or all their life long, Per totum diem. Drus.
which is here set forth (for the brevity of it) by an artificial day, and such
also as no man can be sure he shall have twelve hours to his day: for how many
are there whose Sun has set at high-noon? in the prime and pride of their
days, have they been suddenly snatched away by the hand of death: yea, how many
see we whose sun sets in the very rising, so that they are carried from the
birth to the burial? Every hour, surely, we all yield somewhat unto death,
and a very short cut has the longest liver of all, from the grave of the womb
to the womb of the grave. Eliphaz here seems to compare us to those creatures
called Ephemer^bii, which are young in the morning, middle-aged at non, Aristot.
and dead (...) night; they begin and end their lives in a day. Man's life is a
vapor, says St. James, a bubble, say the Heathens, a blast, a dream, a
shadow, a dream of a shadow etc.

They perish for ever] That is, they die once for all. For if a man die, shall
he live again? Job 14.14. No such matter. In this war as there is no
discharge, Eccles. 8.8. so neither is it granted to any man to err twice:
therefore Austin said that he would not for the gain of a million of worlds be
an Atheist for half an hour: because he knew not but God might in that time
call for him, and cu^ him off from all time of repentance, acceptance and
grace for ever, since he could die but once only, and after death judgment:
every man's deaths-day is his doomes-day, Heb. 9.27.

Without any regarding it] Heb. putting sc. his heart to it, or laying it upon
his heart, as every man living should do, Eccles. 7.2. but that few or none so
do. See Isa. 57.1. David did, when hearing of his child's decease, he said, I
shall go to him, 2 Samuel 12.23. And Moses seeing the peoples carcasses fall so
fast in the wilderness, prayed for himself and the rest, So teach us to number
our days, that we may apply our hearts to wisdom, Psalm. 90.12. Every dead
corpse is a Monitor, a dumb preacher: Etiam muta clamant cadavera. Abel, though
dead, speaks; but how few hearken to him? Dives thought that if one came from
the dead to fore-warn his brethren, great matters would be done. Petrus
Sutorius tells of one, that preaching a funeral Sermon on a religious man,
as he calls him, and giving him large commendations, heard at the same time a
voice in the Church, Mortuus sum, judicatus sum, damnatus sum, I am dead, I am
judged, I am damned. Pet. Suitor. de vita Carth.
This very much wrought upon the heart of Bruno, says he, and occasioned him
to found the Carthusian order. Waldus a French Merchant, was so affected with
the death of one that died suddenly in his presence, that he thenceforth became
a right godly man, and the Father of the Waldenses, those ancient Protestants
in France, called also, The poor men of Lions. But oh the dead lethargy, the
spirit of fornication that has so besotted the minds of the most, that they
can see death, and yet not think of it! they can look into the dark chamber of
the grave, and never make the least preparation for it: if for present they be
somewhat affected, and have some good impressions, yet they soon vanish, as the
water circled by a stone cast into it, soon returns to its former smoothness;
as chickens run under the wings of the hen, whiles the kite is over them, or in
a storm; but soon after get abroad again, amd dust themselves in the Sun. As
Nebuchadnezzar had seen a vision, but it was gone from him; so here, if men at
the house of mourning have ^ome good motions, they improve them not to
resolutions, or draw not forth their resolutions into execution etc.

Verse 21. Does not their excellency which is in them go away?] Journyeth not
their excellency with them? so Broughton renders it. By their excellency here,
some understand the soul, called by David his glory. A Philosopher said,
Favorium.
there was nothing excellent in the world but man, nothing in man but his soul.
The Stoics affirmed, that the body was not a part of a man, but the
instrument, or rather, the servant of the soul. Hence the Latins call the body
Corpus or Corpor (as of old they speak) quasi cordis puer sive famulus. And
Plato says, Camer. (...).
that that is not the man that is seen of him; but the mind of a man, that is
the man. And in the 19 verse of this chap. man is said to dwell in an house of
clay; that is, the soul to inhabit the body. The soul goes away with the name
of the whole person: the soul indeed is the man in a moral consideration, and
is therefore elsewhere called the inward man, 2 Cor. 4.16. 1 Pet. 3.4.
and the hidden man of the heart: the body compared to it, is but as a
clay-wall encompassing a treasure, a course case to a rich instrument, a
leathern sheath to an excellent blade, Dan. 7.15. or as a mask to a beautiful
(...). Now at death, this excellency of a man departs, returns to God that
gave it, Eclesias ^.7. His breath goes forth, he returns to his earth, in
that very day his thoughts perish; even the most excellent effects of his mind
and spirit, as the word signifies, Psalm. 146.4 And as that, so all other
excellencies go away at death, Psalm. 39.11. and 49.13. even the whole
goodlinesse of man, Isa. 40.6. whether it be the good things of the mind, as
wisdom, science, conscience, judgment: or of the body, as beauty and health;
or of fortune (as they call it) as favor and applause, together with plenty of
prosperity. No man's glory goes down with him into the grave, Psalm. 49.16.
Where is now the flourishing beauty, and gallantry of Caesar, says one? his
armies and honors, his triumphs and trophies? where are the rich fools great
barnes? Nebuchadnezzars great Babel? Agrippa's great pomp etc? Have not all
these made their bed in the dark, leaving their excellency behind them? Are
they not (many of them) gone to their place, as a stone to the center, or as a
fool to the stocks?

They dye even without wisdome] Heb. They die, and not with wisdom; They die
like so many beasts (but for their pillow and bolster) without any care to lay
hold on eternal life; 1 Samuel 3.33.
they die as a fool dies. Not in wisdom; that is, in abundance of folly,
says Pineda: and this is most men's case; their wit serves them not in this
weighty work of preparing to die; they put far away the thoughts of it, and
hence they die tempore non suo, Eccles 7.17. when it were better for them to do
any thing, rather then to die. To live with dying thoughts, is an high point of
heavenly wisdom, Psalm. 90.12. Deuteronomy. 32.29. How might one such wise Christian
chase a thousand foolish and hurtful lusts, 1 Timothy 6.4.
which drown men's souls in perdition and destruction?

CHAP. V. Verse 1. Call now, if there be any that will answer thee]
THe beginning of this chapter is hard, says Mercer, till you come to the
seventh or eighth verses, and then all is plain and easy. That which Eliphaz
drives at here, is, to drive Job out of all good conceit of his own condition,
and to persuade him, that never any good man suffered such hard and heavy
things as he, or at least suffered them so untowardly and impatiently. Call, I
pray thee, says he, call over the roll, look into the records of former
Saints, and see if thou can find among them all such another knotty piece as
thy self, that needed so much hewing, and made such a deal of complaining. Was
there ever the like heard of? Call now, if there be any one answerable to thee.
Broughton renders it, Call now, if there be any one that will defend thee;
that is, be thy Patron or advocate in word, or in the example of their lives.

And to which of the S^^nts will thou turn? q. d. Thou art alone, neither may
thou hope to meet with thy match in the matter or manner of thine afflictions,
unless it be among hypocrites and graceless persons, as verse 2. The
Septuagint read it, To which of the Angels will thou look? And the Popish
Commentators think they have here an unanswerable ground for their Doctrine of
invocation of Saints and Angels. But did not the buzzards take notice of an
Irony here, and that Eliphaz assures Job that it would be in vain for him to
call to any Saint etc? Is it not plain, or probable at least, that he here
means the Saints living in this world? or if not, yet is Gregory the great of
no authority with them, who acknowledges none other to be called upon, here
meant, but God; and that the Saints are mentioned to Job in derision, as if it
were a ridiculous thing to call to them departed out of this life; who cannot
hear us?

Verse 2. For wrath kills the foolish man] Such as thou art, Job; hot and
hasty, pettish and passionate, fretting thy self to do evil, and so provoking
God to fall soul upon thee as a just object of his wrath, to thine utter ruin
without repentance. Surely, with the froward, God will show himself froward,
Psalm. 18.26. Neither has ever any one hardened himself against the Lord and
prospered, Job 9.4. For why? he is wise in heart, and mighty in strength, as it
is there, every way able to over-master an adversary, if he but turn his own
passions loose upon him, such as are wrath and envy, they will soon dispatch
him: How many are there, who like sullen birds in a cage, beat themselves to
death? did not Bajazet do so? and was Diodorus any wiser? or Homer, ^ert. lib.
2.
who died for anger that they could not resolve certain questions put unto
them? or Terence who drowned himself for grief, that he had lost certain
Comedies that he had composed? We read of some, that out of discontent they
turned Atheists, as Dia^oras, Lucian, Porphyry etc. and of others, Diod. Sic.
that missing of Bishoprics, or other Church-preferments, they turned
heretics in Jui solatium; were not these great sinners against their own
souls, like the angry Be, who to be revenged, loses her sting, and soon
after her life? Died they not like fools indeed, that died of the sullens, and
so were deeply guilty of self-murder? especially if their wrath were bent
against God, Ard^l^onem.
if they howl against heaven: such are at once twice slain; slain with the
wrath of God, and with their own.

And envy slays the silly one] Him that is under the power of his passions,
(...). De A^^ce Homer.
and minima afflictione ab officio abducitur, says Mercer, and is turned off
from duty by every light affliction: such an one does envy at another man's
prosperity. It is the same with wrath, nisi quod vehementius est, but that it
is somewhat worse, says the same Author, as being a most quick-sighted, and
sharp-fanged malignity. Hence that of Solomon, Wrath is cruel, and anger
outrageous; but who can stand before envy? Prove. 27.4. It is the rottenness of
the bones, Prove. 14.30. And like the serpent Porphyrius, it drinks the most
part of its own venom. See the Note on Prove. 14.30.

Verse 3. I have seen the foolish taking roote] q. d. I grant, that wicked men
are not always presently punished, sed Nemesis in tergo; and subito tollitur,
qui diu toleratur. Gods wrath is such, as no wicked man can avert or avoid.
This had Eliphaz well observed, I have seen: he had set a Memorandum on Gods
just judgments, and marked his spits with his own stars, as one speaks.
Eliphaz was a man of much experience, see chap. 4.8. In him, that was true
which Elihu says, should be, that days spoke, and multitude of years taught
wisdom, chap. 32.7. Only herein he is mistaken, that he mis-applieth all to
Job, arguing from his outward condition, to his inward; as if therefore he were
wicked, because seemingly wretched. Thus the gloss he set was viperous, eating
out the bowels of the text: It was a truth of God that he uttered, and the same
in sense with that of David, Psalm. 37.35. And that of Solomon, Pro. 23.18. But
why should he thus writhe it and wrest it to make the tune sound to his own
key? St Peter speaks of some that wrest the Scriptures, 2 Pet. 3.16. putting
them upon the rack, Caedem scripturarum faciunt.
and making them speak that which they never thought. And Tertullian says of
others, that they do murder the Scriptures for their own turns, and to serye
their own purposes; But let us hear Eliphaz, I have seen, says he, and what
more sure then sight Numb. 16.14? The foolish, the wilful fool, and perhaps he
points at some one such rich fool as is mentioned, Luke 12.20. not unknown to
Job, and as Eliphaz deemeth a fit parallel for him, taking root, dwelling alone
in the earth, confirmed and settled in a fair estate, in a prosperous condition,
as Nebuchadnezzar that goodly tree thought himself, Dan. 4.4, 22. (See Jer.
12.2.) and Dionysius tyrant of Sicily, Aelian. var. hist. lib. 2.
who conceited that his Kingdom was bound fast unto him with chains of
adamant; But he was soon after cast out, and thereby convinced of singular
folly. A tempest, or at least an axe of divine vengeance, can easily fell these
fast rooted, and best-fruited trees, and lay them low enough, as he did
Nebuchadnezzar that maule of the Nations, and rod of Gods wrath, Isa. 14.4, 5,
6, 7, 8. Dan. 4.22. etc. and Attilas the Conquering Hunne, who called himself
the Wrath of God, and Scourge of the world; P. Jovius.
and arrogantly said, that the stars of heaven fell before him, and the earth
trembled, but was soon after rooted up by impartial death in the midst of his
nuptial solemnities.

And suddenly I cursed his habitation] His house, which he held his castle,
Subita morte extinctus est, sanguine copiose in fauces exundante and ex ore
crump.
together with his family, verse 4. and his family-provisions, verse 5. All
these Eliphaz suddenly (even when he was in the ruff of all his jollity, in
the height of his flourish) cursed, Heb. pierced, or bored through, not so much
by a malediction, as a prediction, Male ominatus sum iis, I foresaw and
foretold that that happiness would not hold long. I ominously divined it; I
both thought it, and spoke it. Pi^^ non decent di^ae; cursing men are cursed
men: but a godly person may presage a curse, and foretell it, according to that
Prove. 3.33. The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked, yea, the
flying ^^^le of curses that is ten yards long, and five yards broad shall
remain in the midst of it, and consume it. Zech. 5.4. Brimstone shall be
scattered upon his habitation, and the fire of God shall kindle it; so that his
roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off etc.
Job 18.15, 16.

Verse 4. His children are far from safety] This is one principal root of
wicked men, viz. their children, which have their very name in Hebrew from
building, because by them the house is built up, and way made to greatest
honors by friendships and affinities of other great families. These are far
from safety, that is, they are in a great deal of danger; or by their
intemperance they run into many diseases and disasters, Lavat.
by their evil practices they come under the lash of the Law, and without
repentance under the danger of damnation too; salvation is far from them,
Psalm. 119.155. Isa. 59.11.

They are crushed in the gate] That is, they are cast in judgment, all goes
against them, and sentence pronounced upon them, as it befell Hamans children,
and David's enemies, Psalm. 109.7.

Neither is there any to deliver them] None to plead for them, or rescue them,
Prove. 31.8, 9. none to extend mercy to them, nor any to favor those
fatherless children, Psalm. 109.12. and that because their fathers were
pitilesse, verse 13, 14. Haman for instance.

Verse 15. Whose harvest the hungry eats up] This is another root of the
wicked One, his estate, against which, God raises up a rout of needy wretches
to pillage him. These are as a sweeping rain that leaves no food, Prove. 28.3.
These, as lean lice, bite hardest, and as sparrow-hawkes, are extreme greedy:
Malesuada fames puts them upon it. These Harpies seize upon his very harvest
ad majorem cruciatum and miseriam, pulling the meat out of his mouth, as it
were, and not suffering him to roast that which he took in hunting, Prove. 12,
27. He shall meet with greatest disappointment, and come to that poverty
which he so studiously shunned, singing that doleful ditty -- En queis
consevimus agros?
(...).
See this threatened, Lev. 26.16. Deuteronomy. 28.33. Isa. 1.6. Micah 6.15.

And takes it even out of the thornes] Creeping through the midst of the
thorns and bushes wherewith it is fenced and hedged in, to steal it away.
Hunger we say, breaks through stone walls: the Rabbines sense it thus, He
that comes out of the thorns, Scutatus.
that is, every base fellow carries away the store of this rich oppressor. The
armed man carries it away, so the Vulgar after the Septuagint. Mr. Broughton
reads it thus, The hungry shall eat up his harvest which he had gotten through
the thorns, that is, not without a great deal of care, and much pains in
stubbing up the thorns, that he might not sow amongst them.

And the robber swalloweth up their substance] Or the thirsty shall drink up
their substance, as gold-thirsty Babel did Hezekiahs treasure for his coming so
near the garb and guise of the wicked in his ostentation. The thirsty shall
swill up their wealth, so Broughton renders it ^^so that neither their
esculenta nor poculenta shall escape the spoiler, but there shall be a clean
riddance of all; the enemy shall play at sweep-stake, (...)
he shall soop up all, as the Hebrew has it, and as Eliphaz would have Job
consider, that the Chaldees and Sabees had done his substance.

Verse 6. Although affliction comes not forth of the dust] It comes not by
fate or blind fortune, it haps not as it may, that men suffer. Philistines
indeed, will say happily, It is a chance, 1 Samuel 6.9. a common occurrence, that had
a time to come in, and must have a time to go in: but every Naomi will in such
case conclude, The hand of the Lord is gone out against me, Ruth 1.13. and
carry her sails accordingly, verse 20, 21. and every good soul will cry out,
I will bear the indignation of the Lord (who is the efficient cause of all my
miseries) because I have sinned against him, which is the meritorious cause.
The word here rendered affliction, signifies also iniquity; and well it may,
since they are tied together with chains of adamant, as that Heathen said,
Flugitism and (...) sunt sicut (...) and silum, says another. Man weaves a
spiders web of sin out of his own bow^^^, says a Third; and then he is
entangled in the same web: the troubles which ensnare and wrap about him, are
twisted with his own fingers: Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where
no ginne is for him, Am. 3.6^ (...), Of the black-birds dung is made the
bird-lime whereby he (...): so out of the dung of men's sins are made the
lime-twigs of their punishments.

Verse 7. Yet man is borne unto trouble] Which is the natural fruit of his
sin; and a piece of the curse; he has in him a (...), a common seminary of
all sin, and this he brings into the world with him; what wonder then though
troubles come trouping in upon him on every side, as if he were born for no
other end but to suffer, and that as naturally as fire ascends? Sure it is,
that sin does as naturally and ordinarily draw and suck judgments to it, as
the loadstone does iron, or Turpentine fire. Some read the words thus, Man is
borne to sin, and so consequently to trouble: for sin usually ends
tragically, and troublesomely. Hence the same word both here, and that in the
former verse, signify both sin and sorrow; and man by reason of his
birth-blot, has a birthright to them both, he is even born to them. The
devil, when he speaks lies, speaks of his own, Joh. 8.44. And we, when
either we do evil, we work de nostro and sicundum hominem, of our own, and
according to men, 1 Cor. 3.3. Or when we suffer evil, we suffer nothing but
what is humane and incident to men, 1 Cor. 10.13. Thy very heathen could say as
much; witness that of Xenophon, (...), It behooveth him that is no more then a
man, to expect all sorts of troubles: and that of Demosthenes, it is fit for
men to hope the best, but bravely to bear the worst, as that which is common
to all mankind: and that of Isocrates, O (...) etc. He that remembers that he
is a man, will not be discontented at whatsoever trouble befalls him: and
that of Herodotus, (...), Every man is miserable. For this it was likely, that
God, to keep Ezekiel lowly in the abundance of revelations, calls him so often
Son of man. And when the French King, Joh. Manl. loc. com. 175. Homo sum,
humanum nihil a me alicnum puto.
being prisoner to Charles the fifth saw written upon the wall that Emperors
motto, plus ultra, further yet, and underwrote, Hodie mihi, cras tibi, I am now
thy prisoner thou may hereafter be mine; the Emperor came after him, and
subscribed; I confess I am a man, and may soon suffer any thing incident to
mankind.

As the sparks fly upward] Heb. The sons of the quick or live coal lift up
to fly: The vulgar has it, as the birds fly upward; the Septuagint, As the
young vultures fly upwards. Sparks and birds fly upward naturally, and by a
principle of their own they need not be taught it so here. Birds, though they
have more of the earth then of the other three elements, Genesis 2.19. yet are
light (which is a wonder) and delight in high-flying, and this is innate to
them; so is it to man, as man, to be in trouble, Job 14.1. Some of the Hebrews
by sparks, or sons of the quick coal, here understand the devils, and make
this to be the sense; like as sin is connatural to men, so does God stir up
the devils, to whom it is as natural to flutter up and down here for the
punishment of such as sin: Sed hoc friget, says Mercer; but this is not
likely to be the meaning.

Verse 8. Surely I would seek unto God] Not let fly at him, as thou have done,
cursing thy birthday, and wishing thy self out of the world. Assure thy self,
this that thou take, is not the way to get off with comfort, but rather to
return (by repentance) unto him, that smites thee, and to seek the Lord of
Hosts, Isa. 9.12. since else; his anger will not turn away, but his hand will
be stretched out still (as the Prophet there has it) for is it fit that he
should lay down the bucklers first? or that we should stand upon terms, and
capitulate with him, and not stoop unto him by an humble yieldance? especially
sithence -- Deus crudelius urit
Quos videt invitos succubuisse sibi. Tibul. Eleg 1.8



The way to disarme Gods heavy indignation, is to submit to his justice, and to
implore his mercy, Hos. 5.14. to fly from his Anger to his Grace, Blood-letting
is a cure of bleeding, and a burn a cure against a burn; and running to God
is the way to escape him; as to close and get in with him that would strike
you, does avoid the blow: and this is that that I would do, were I in thy case,
says Eliphaz here. He does not vaunt (as Olympiodorus mistaketh his meaning)
but advise Job, to humble himself, and confess his sins, and sue for pardon
of sin, and release of punishment, to kiss the rod, and not to bite it; to
drink of Gods cup willingly and at first, when it is full (as Mr. Bradford
Martyr has it), lest if he linger, he drink at length of the dregs with the
wicked.

And unto God] the righteous Judge, as the word imports, Phocyl.
who (...), neither ^areth nor fears any man (as it was said of Trajan the
Emperor, but more truly of God:) he proceeds, according to truth, not
according to opinion or appearance, and greatly scorneth to look at
displeasure, revenge or recompense.

Would I commit my cause] Put my case and condition by self-resignation, and
humble supplication. This David did notably, 2 Samuel 15.25, 26. Psalm. 142.2. and
counsels all to do accordingly, Psalm. 55.22. Cast thy burden (or thy request)
upon the Lord by virtue of this writ or warrant.

Verse 9. Which does great things and unsearchable] The better to persuade Job
to take his counsel, he enters into a large description of Gods attributes,
his Power, Wisdom, Aug.
Justice, Mercy etc. all which are clearly seen in his works of wonder as in
a mirror, or as on a theater. These he is ever in doing, as the word here
signifies; and shows himself great in great things, and not little in the
least, dum memora culicis and pulicis disponit; yea, he uses to be greater in
smaller things, then in bigger. The soul is more operative in Ants, then in
Elephants; in Dwarfes, then in Giants. So he delights to help his people with a
little help, Dan. 11.34 (that through weaker means they may see his greater
strength) to magnify his power in pardoning their many and mighty sins,
Numb. 14.17, 18. Micah 7.18. to illustrate his power in their perseverance and
wonderful preservation amidst a world of evils and enemies, John 10.29. 1 Pet.
1.5. to fulfill his promises, seem they never so improbable or impossible,
Jer. 32.14, 15. to answer prayers that look as if lost, and to do for his
people exceeding abundantly above all that they can ask or think, according to
the power that works in them, Ephesians. 3.20. All this Eliphaz would have Job to
consider, that he might not cast away his confidence, but seek to God, and turn
his talk to him, as Beza turns the foregoing words.

And unsearchable] Heb. And no search, for they are fathomlesse, and past
finding out, Romans 11.33. This, Eliphaz might say, to stop Jobs curiosity, and
to humble him for his sin, in enquiring too much into the reason of Gods so
severe dealing with him, chap. 3. In prying too far, or too boldly into the
secret workings of God. It should suffice us to know that the will of Gods is
the rule of right, that his judgments are sometimes secret, always just; that
it is extreme folly to reprehend what we cannot comprehend (we may as soon
comprehend the sea is a cockleshell, as the unsearchable things of God in our
narrow and shallow understandings) that at the last day all things shall be
cleared up, and every mouth stopped, when exquisite reasons of all Gods
proceedings (which now seem not so well carried) shall be produced, and
wisdom shall be justified of her children.

Mavelous things] Such as the wisest may well wonder at. God is the only
Thaumaturgus, the great wonder-worker; and these marvels are more ordinary then
the most are, either at all either aware of, or affected with. To let pass
those wonders of the Creation (for which, see Psalm. 136.4, 5, 6, 7.) Can thou
tell how the bones grow in her that is with child, says Solomon's Eccl. 11.5.
Mirificatus sum mirabilibus operis tuis, so Montanus renders that of David,
Psalm. 139.14. I am fearfully and wonderfully made: mavelous are thy works
etc. Galen, that great Naturallist, Fernel. de abd. rer. cause.
was much amazed at the motion of the lungs in man's body, and would needs offer
sacrifices therefore to that God whom he knew not. Who can give a natural
reason of the strength of the neather-chap, of the heat in the stomach, of the
colors in the rainbow, of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea, or but of this
ordinary occurrence, that chafe is so cold, that it keeps snow hidden within
it from melting, and withal, so warm, that it hasteneth the ripening of
Apples? Well might Eliphaz say, that God does mavelous things, without number.

Verse 10. Who gives vain upon the earth] This is reckoned, and rightly, among
the mavelous works of God. See chap. 28.26. Jer. 10.13. Amos 5.8. Acts
14.17. Rain is the flux of a moist cloud, which being dissolved by little and
little by the heat of the Sun, lets down (...) by drops out of the middle
region of the air: this is Gods gift. For he 1. (...) it* Job. 28.26. 2.
Prepares it, Psalm. 147.8. 3. Withholds it at his pleasure, ^^opping those
bottles that should yield it, Amos 4.7. 4. Sends (...) the behoof and benefit
of man and (...), as also for the demonstration of his Power, Wisdom,
Justice, and Goodness, whereof he has not left himself (...) by without
witness, Acts 14.17. whiles he weighs these waters above the firmament by
measure, so that not one drop falls in vain, or in a wrong place. In those
hot countries, where Rivers were scant, rain was highly valued: they called it
the husband of the earth, because the earth can no more hear fruit without it
then a woman children without the company of a man. The Egyptians were wont in
mockery to tell the Grecians, that if their God (whom they called
cloud-gathering Jupiter) should forget to give rain, (...)
they might chance to sterve for it: see the reason, Deuteronomy. 11.8. -- 11, 12.
Egypt was watered with the soot as a garden, by sluices from Nilus: not so
Canaan.

He sends waters upon the fields] irrigat aquis universa says the vulgar,
He moisteneth all places with waters; by the showers which falling upon the
ground, run hither and thither, he divides the fields as it were, into streets
and high ways; so Beza paraphraseth. Another thus, It Is he himself who
waters it, as well by those waters which fall from heaven, as by those which
he has hidden in its entrails, and whose secret draines produce in a thousand
places sources and rivers. Some render it, upon the out-places, and understand
it of wildernesses, to set forth Gods bounty. Others render it, upon the face
of the streets, and will have it meant of Navigable rivers, which by the
passage upon them, do after a sort, make streets and highway ways through
several Countries, to the which also they convey many commodities.

Verse 11. To set up on high those that be low] By those rich raines whereby
he fatteneth the earth, and makes it fruitful, giving them a whole country of
corn, Aben-Ezra.
as he did that vir divitiarum qui animam etiam habuit tririceam. Luke 12.16.
But God has more ways then this, to prefer men to riches, honor, and
authority, as he did Joseph, David, Daniel, Mordecai etc. He raises up the
poor out of the dust, and lifts the needy out of the dunghill, that he may
set him with Princes, etc. Psalm. 113.6, 7. Let Job hear this, and know it for
his good, as ver. 27.

That those which mourn] As those do commonly who are in a low condition, and
it is much if they murmur not. The word signifies, such as are pullato. (...)
in mourners weeds, or that having layn among the pots, are smutched and
sullied like so many black scullions, Psalm. 68.13.10, Lo, these shall the Lo^d
not only make to he as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her
feathers with yellow gold, but shall also make them to mount up with wings as
Eagles, Isa. 40, 31. He shall exalt them to safety, says Eliphaz here: yea, he
shall safely exalt them to safety. Wicked men are often exalted, Psalm. 12. ult.
but then it is not to safety, -- toumutur in aelium ut lapsu graviore ruant,
they are listed up, but for a mischief, that they may he brought down again
with the greater poise, as Haman and Pharaohs chief Baken, whose head was
listed up, but to the gallows: the chief Butlers head was lifted up too, but
aster another manner. There is great difference betwixt the advancement of the
righteous and the wicked. Those God carries as the Eagle does her young on her
wings, to exalt them to safety, to set them upon a rock that is higher then
they, these he lifts up as the Eagle does her prey in her talons, to dash
them against some rock, and to destroy them.

Verse 12. He disappointeth the devices of the crafty] He vacateth and endreth
ineffectual the curious contrivances of the worlds wisards, full of (...)
subtilty, and so sets his people in safety, by out-plotting their enemies;
served he not Pharaoh so (who dealt craftily with our fathers, says (...),
Acts 7^.19.) (...).
and Saul that subtle tyrant? and Herod that crofty-fox, Luke. 13.32? and all
the primitive and modern persecutors to whom the old Dragon had lent his seven
head to plot, and his ten horns to push against the people of God, but all
(...) purpose? God disappointed the devises of those (...) so the Vulgar (...)
which the Chaldee appropriateth to Pharaoh and his Counsell^^s, who said, Comes
and let us deal wisely; when as (in laying hand taskes upon the Israelite to
keep them from increasing) they never dealt, (...) your laboring men have the
most and the (...).

So that their hands (...) an actual being or such (...) Broughton renders
it: Otherr thus, (...) that is, (...) what they had (...) the (...)
cruel-crafties of the primitive times, sounded the triumph beforehand, and
engraved the victory upon the pillars of marble: but the Church may still sing
as of old, Psalm. 20.8.
They are brought down and fallen, but we are risen and stand upright. Charles
the fifth and the French King had covenanted the utter extirpation of the
Lutheran faction throughout their dominions; but God found them other
employment, and gave his Church an happy Haleyon. And who knows not how God
has hitherto helped us of this Nation against the power and policy of earth,
and of hell?

Verse 13. He takes the wise in their own crastinesse] Those wise to do evil,
worldly wise, mere machiavellians; for though the Florentine Secretary was not
born of some thousands of years after Eliphaz speak this, yet the devil was
well nigh as great a master then as how, and had his crafty cubs, students, and
great proficients in that wisdom which St. James affirms to be from
beneath, and not from above (like the wings of the Ostrich, it may help a man
to outrun others upon earth, but helps not at all toward heaven) and further
describes it to be earthly, sensual, divelish. Earthly, as managing the lusts
of the eyes unto the ends of gain; Sensual, as managing the lusts of the flesh
unto ends of pleasure: and Divellish, as managing the pride of life unto ends
of power: these subtle Sirs, these profound politicians, that dig deep to
hide their counsels, not from men only, but (which is impossible) from the
Lord, (...) 1 Cor. 3.19.
Isa. 29.15. that think they can work out any thing, and that none can prevent
them (as the Apostles word from this text imports) God takes and makes fools
of them; he frustrateth the tokens of these liars, and makes the diviners mad:
he turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish, Isa. 44.25.
Surely the Princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise counselors of
Pharaoh is become brutish -- they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are
the stay of the tribes thereof: the Lord has mingled a spirit of perversities
in the midst thereof; and they have caused Egypt to err in every work
thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit, Ifai. 19.11, 13, 14. Did
ever any man deal so unwisely as Ahitophel that Oracle, 2 Samuel 17.23. Curious
to provide for his family after his death, and yet careless to preserve
himself from eternal death? Was not this a madness even to a miracle? He
should first (says a Reverend man) have set himself in order, and then he
might have hanged his house with coverings of tapestry, Pro. 7.26. and with
broidered work of Egypt. Ezekiel. 27.7. And if he had bridled his anger when he
saddled his Ass, he would not have broken the lanthorn of his body, and
quenched the light of his life, he would not have put his house in order, and
himself into such a desperate and irrecoverable confusion. But what says
Solomon? His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be
holden with the cords of his sins, Prove. 5.22. The Lord is known by the
judgment which he executes, the wicked is snared in the work of his own
hands. Higguion, Selah. Mark (...) ate, as one renders it, Psalm. 9.16.

And the counsel of the froward is carried head-long] More haste it makes then
good speech, Lib. 2. de Invent.
though it be the counsel that is the extract of reason, the result of serious
and (...) (as Cicero defines it) because it proceeds from froward persons,
obtorti, contortuplicati, such as have one crafty device twisted within
another, like a nope, such as of whom we use to say in a proverb, there never
wants a new (...) cap.

Verse (...) They meet with darkness in the day-time] They are infatuated and
besotted; a spirit of giddiness seizes them: ita ut in re clarissima

upon their power and policy, so that they are like Owls, that can see better
in the dark then in the light and like Moles, that dig dexterously under
ground, but are blind above ground neither do they ever open their eyes till
the pangs of death are upon them.

Verse 15. But he saves the poor from the sword] From the (...) of war, from
the hurt of it, not always from the smart of it; for all such promises as this
of temporal deliverance, are ever to be taken with exception of the cross;
which yet shall be so sanctified, that the Saints shall say, It was good for us
to have been afflicted. Provided, that they be poor in spirit (for God will
save the humble person, Job 22.29.) and sue in form a pauperis, as spiritual
beggars, such is get their living by begging; the word signifies needy and
desirous of reliefs, very indigent, and therefore humbly suppliant for supply
of things necessary: This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him (meaning
himself) and saved him out of all his troubles, Psalm. 34.6. Forget not the
congregation of thy poor for ever, Psalm. 74.19. He will not, he cannot, for
they are written upon the palms of his hands, so that he cannot look beside
them. Who has not heard how graciously (...) Geneva has been preserved?
Rochel relieved, as it were, by a miracle? Leyden (...) from the Duke of Alva's
sword; that very night that he thought to have stormed it, Anno 1573.
the winds turned, the tide swelled, and the waters came in, and forced him to
raise the siege: how well might these poor saved ones sit and sing with David,
Psalm 68.20. He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto God the Lard
belong the issues from death?

From their mouth] Which is a sword, so some sense is: God saves his poor
from the sword of their enemies mouth, or the sword that comes out of their
mouth. A gladio or is coram, says the Vulgar: David felt the false tongues of
his enemies, as a murdering weapon in his bones, Psalm. 42.10. The tongue is
thin, broad, and long, like a sword, it is also red line a flaming sword: by
(...) and false testimonies many are those that fall down wounded, Prove. 12.6.
and 18.8. and 26.22. Core and his compli^ts stick not to object to the meekest
of men with one breath, pride, ambition, and usurpation of authority, but God
vindicated his reputation. Mary was accused three several times: the Pharisees
accused her of presumption, Luke 7.39. Martha of carelessenesse, Luke 10.^0.
Judas of wastefulnesse, John 12.5. but Christ ever answered for her, and took
her part. And was it not so with Job chap. 42? Is there not a promise to all
Saints Psalm 37.6^.

From the band of the mighty] God saves his, not only from the virulent
tongues, but from the violent hands also of the mighty, that might overcome not
right, that the poor fall not by his strong ones, or into his strong paws and
parts, Psalm. 10.10. where oppressors are fitly compared to lions lying in wait
for their prey. Now to be thus saved from the slaying sword, the (...) tongue;
and the oppressing (...) is complete salvation.

Verse 16. So the poor has hops] How should it be otherwise? will breed
confidence Thou have, that wilt it an ordinary Scripture (...), Psalm 8^, 1, 2,
3, 4. and 2 Cor. 1.10. So, the poor helpnesse, hopeless person, who is pined
away, spent and utterly exhausted and (...) and wealth, he has hope (...) had
given away all) and this holds head above water, (...) beguiled calamity; as
good company does the way. Neither is (...) state in all men's eyes, is at
lowest. I was brought low (or drawn dry, the same word as here) and he helped
me, Psalm. 110.6^ So He will regard the prayer of the destitute, Psalm. 102.17.
The Hebrew word there signifies a pair shrub that is in the wilderness low and
slender (...) upon by (...), unregarded, worthless, such an one (...) God and
is lightened, (...) 4.5. conceives lively hope, hope unfailable through faith
unfeigned, having earnest expectation (as the word signifies) of strong (...)
so that he can truly say with Saint Paul, when I am weak, then (...) strong, 2
Cor. 12.10. Such prisoners of hope can turn them to the strong holds,
Zech.^9.12.

And inequity stopped her mouth] Iniquity, that is, the workers of iniquity,
those worst sor^ of sinners (the word imports men of manifold perverseness)
amazed at god (...) good suecesses, contrary to there expectation; shall stand
speechless, Maligni and nocendi studiosi. Aquinas.
(...) did, Matthew. 22.12. convicted of their wickedness, and confounded at
Gods wonderful works. See the like Isa. 52.15. Psalm 107, 42. Mic. 7.16. Jor
8.4. Thus Jannes and Jambres were silenced and convinced, but not converted. No
more are many now a-dayes, who yet have as little to say as they. The full
accomplishment of this promise is not to be looked for till the last day.

Verse 17. Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth] This Behold holds
forth a paradox, a strange sight, viz. An afflicted man, a blessed man: this
the world wondreth at, and can as little conceive of, or consent to, as the
Philistines could of Sampsons riddle of meat out of the cater etc. How can
these things be, say they? It will never be, says Sense: it can never be,
says Reason; it both can be; and will be, says Faith; the property whereof,
is to gather one contrary out of another; life out of death, happiness out of
misery, assurance of deliverance out of deepest distresses, and to believe God
upon his bare word, and that against sense in things invisible, and against
reason in things incredible. What if the afflicted man be Enosh (that is the
word here) a sorry, sickly, miserable man, so the world esteems him yet
Blessed is the man. (there he is called Geber the gallant man) whom thou (...),
O Lord, and teach him out of thy Law. Psalm. 94.12. Oh the happinesses, the
(...), the present and future happiness of the man whom God corrects, and
withal instructs, chastening him with pain upon his bed, and withal opening
his cares to counsel, and sealing his instructions, Job 33.16, 19 disputing him
out of his evil practices, with a rod in his hand.

Therefore despise not than the chastening of the Almighty.] Fret not, faint
not, be not so impatient as to think that either thy crosses come not from God,
or not in mercy, or that he is not All-sufficient to bear thee up under them,
or to help thee out of them. Set not light by his love tokens (this is one of
those two extremes Solomon warnes us of Prove. 3.11. neither despise
afflictions, nor despond under them) See my Treatise called Gods love tokens,
and the afflicted man's lessons, page 37, 38, 39. etc. Loath we are to take up
the cross, and when called to carry it, we shrink in the shoulder: no
chastening seems joyous but grievous; as averse the best may be to it, Psalm.
75.8.
as a sick man is to those physical slibber-sawees; he had as lieve die almost
as take them down; How then, alas, will wicked men do to drink off that cup
of Gods wrath that has eternity to the bottom? Let the saints be content, and
say, Far minora voto, ne gravior a feram, It is the Lords mercy that we are
not consumed, L^in. 3.22. that we are set safe from the wrath to come,
whatever here betideth us: It is the chastening of the Almighty, who could as
easily crush us as correct us. See Isai 13.6. Jeal 1.15.

Verse 18. For he makes fore, and binds up] As a Surgeon makes an incision,
to let out the impost humed matter, and then heals up the wound again: God
has a salve for every sore, a medicine for every malady; he is both a Father
and a physician, he (...) us not unless a^ed be, 1 Pes. 1.6. We are judged
of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. Would we that God
should let us alone to perish in our (...) Ephraim, Hos. 4.14.) and not meddle
with us? (...) they are set? (...) up our fores before they (...) mercy more
cruel then any cruelty, as a Father calls it. And yea most (...) of by Luther,
who being in his (...) to take in good part his present pain, as a token of
Gods love answered, Ah quam velim alios amare, non me! If this be his love, I
could wish he would love others, and not me. Luth. in Genesis


He woundeth] This is more then to make sore or sick, like as Heb. 12.6.
Scourging is worse then Chastening. God sometimes makes bloody wales upon the
backs of his best children, he wounds them with the wound of an enemy, Psalm.
68.21. and 110.5. (...) cruentavit.
and leaves them all gore blood, as the word here used imports.

And his hands make whole] He has, as a Surgeon should have, a Ladies hand,
soft and tender, a fathers heart relenting over his pained Ephraims. Hos. Lam.
3.33
11.8. He afflicts not willingly, or from the heart; it goes as much
against the heart with him, as against the hair with us; and evermore Dejicit
us relevet, promit ut solatia prastet
Enecat, ut possit vivificare Deus.


Verse 19. He shall de liver thee] Heb. Snatch thee away, or pull thee out, as
a brand out of the fire, or as a prey out of the teeth of a wild beast. Thus
God snatched Lot out of Sodom, David out of many waters, Paul out of the mouth
of the Lion, Jonah out of the belly of hell etc. As birds flying, so will I
defend Jerusalem, Isa. 31.5 A metaphor from the Eagle and other birds, which
when they fly highest, set a watchful eye upon the nest to rescue their young
ones in case of danger.

In six troubles] Or straits, such as enemies or other evils put men to; Israel
at the red sea, for instance, where they were sorely distressed, encircled with
troubles, neither was there any way of escape, unless they could have gone up
to heaven, which because they could not, heaven came down to them and delivered
them.

Yea in seven] A certain number for an uncertain; boundless deliverances will
God grant to his people, even as often as they shall need deliverance, enemies
often plow upon their backs, and God as often cuts their traces, Psalm. 129.3, 4.
As Cat^ was two and thirty times accused, and two and thirty times cleared and
absolved; so shall it be with the Saints; and this not only at the end of the
world, as Gregory and others interpret this text (as if by six and seven,
allusion were made to Gods creating the world in six days, and resting on the
seventh; and so must his servants labor here under afflictions, and rest in
heaven) but in this life present, where many are the troubles of the righteous,
( millions some render it) but the Lord delivers them out of all, Psalm.
34.19. Yea, in them all, as this text has it, by his supporting grace, and
those divine comforts, which as blown bladders, bear them aloft all waters.

There shall no evil touch thee] so tactu qualitativo, with a deadly touch.
God charge afflictions as David did his Captains concerning Absalom, Handle
the young man gently for my sake. Touch not mine anointed etc. Either touch
them not at all, or not to hurt them. Troubles may touch the Saints, but evils
must not, 1 Cor. 10.14.

Verse 20. In famine be shall redeem thee from death] They that be slain with
the sword, are better then they that be slain with hunger, Lamen. 4.9. Famine
therefore is here set as the first and greatest of the six ensuing evils, the
sorest of Gods judgments, Ezekiel. 6.11. Jer. 24.10. The certain harbinger of
death, as here From this so great a death God delivered Abraham, Gen 12. Isaak,
Genesis 26. Jacob and his family, Genesis 47. The poor widow, 1 Kings 17. The
Israelites in the wilderness by quails; the Rochellers by a miraculous shoale
of shel-fish, cast up into their town in a strait siege etc. There is a promise
that the Lions shall lack and suffer hunger, but so shall not any such as seek
the Lord, Psalm 34.10. There shall be special provision made for such, and
God shall redeem them from this evil by a wonderful separation, as he did in
another case, Exodus ^.22. either he will send them in meat, or take away their
stomachs, as she once said. Fides famem non formidat, Faith fears no famine:
having trusted God for a crown, she will not distrust him for a crust.

And in war from the power of the sword] Here is the Saints safety, or their
writ of protection. True it is, that the sword devoured one, as well as
another, 2 Samuel 11.25. and pale death cutteth its way oftentimes through a wood
of men, out of the mouth of a murdering piece, without distinction. But though
the Saints, with Josiah, be (...) in battle, yet they dye in peace, 2 Kings
23.29. with chap. 22.20. for their eyes see not the evil that God brings upon
others that out live them, as it follows there. Besides, they are gathered to
their fathers, who enjoyed peace. Redeemed they are from the power or hands of
the sword, (...).
which may kill them, but cannot hurt them; take away their head, but not their
crown.

Verse 21. Thon shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue] That is, from
reproaches and slanders, which is a tongue smitting, Jer. 18.18. as smart as
any hand-smiting, and draws blood, Ezekiel 22.9. The devil is both a liar, and a
murderer, John 8.44. Backbiting is back-beating. Speed.
Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, was by the people of England thought to be doubly
murdered (says the Chronicler) viz. by detraction and deadly practice. Plato
commends that law of the Lydians, that punished detracters like as they did
murderers; because their words are swords, and their breath as fire divoureth,
Isai. 33.10. Now from such pests the Lord promises to hide his people, that
either the Traducer shall not find them, Dabhar is the Hebrew for a word,
Dabher for a Pest. Drus.
or not fasten upon them: their names shall be so oyled, that slanderous
aspersions shall not stick to them. Some render the text thus, He shall he
hid, cum vagabitur lingua, when the tongue wandereth or walks about. Their
tongue walks through the earth, Psalm. 73.9. it runs all the world over, and
like a mad dog, snaps at every one. Hence the Hebrew word Ragal to defame or
slander, Psalm. 15.3. properly notes a fooling it up and down, a going to and
fro to carry tales and rumors, 2 Samuel 19.27. Now from such a mischief, from
the lash of such lewd tongues, God will hide his people under the hollow of his
hand, because he knows that many a good heart is more afflicted with words
then with blows, Psalm. 42.3. Saint Paul reckoned, that it were better for him
to die, then that nay man should make his glorying void that is, take away his
good name, and so disable him from doing good by his Ministry, 1 Cor. 9.15.

Neither shall thou be afraid of destruction when it comes.] Much less at the
rumor of it, Matthew. 24.6. Luke 24.9. Thou shall walk about the world as a
conqueror, being above fear, then when others are below hope. Noah-like thou
shall be, -- modiis stanqillus in undis, and not as Magor-missabib, a terror
to thy self and all about thee, Jer. 20.3.

Verse 22. As destruction and famine thou shall laugh] viz. by the force of thy
faith, which (like perfect love) casts out sinsull fear; as grounding upon
Gods infallible promises, and knowing that all the paths of the Lord are mercy
and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies, Psalm 25.10. All
the passages of his providence (...) are to such not only mercy, but truth;
they come to them in a way of a promise, as bound to them by covenant: and
hence their holy courage lifts them up so far above dangers and seares,
that they even laugh at them, as Leviathan laugheth at the shaking of the
spear, Job 41.29. They famish famine, and destroy destruction it self; like as
Christ Jesus the Captain of their salvation, swallowed up death in victory:
and as many of the Martyrs baffled it, deriding their tormentors.

Neither shall thou be afraid of the bests of the earth.] i.e. wild beasts,
that devour men and cattle, as Lions, Bears, Bores, Wolves, etc. whereunto we
may add those Cannibals, man-eating persecutors, who eat up Gods people as
they eat bread, Psalm 14.4. Such Lycanthrope, or beasts in the shape of men,
Paul fought with at Ephesus, and God had delivered him out of the mouth of that
Lion Nero, 2 Timothy 4.17. Who yet afterward martyred him. But the viper at Malta
did him no hurt: no more did the Lions Daniel neither would they meddle with
some of the primitive Martyrs, cast before them to be devoured.

Verse 23. For thou shall be in league with the stones of the field] Thou shall
not das^^thy ^oa^ against them (the Latins east a stone lapidem a laedendo
pede. from hurting the soot that hi^teth against them) Psalm. 91.12. They were
wont of old to go barefoot (as Vatablus here notes.) And our Chronicler
tells us of King Henry the second, that for a per^dnee, going to Canterbury
to the shrine of Thomas Becket, his bare feet with the hard stones were forced
to yield bloody tokens of his devotion on the way, or thus, The stones of the
field shall not hinder thy harvest, as Marth. 13.6. Or being picked up for a
mound or wall, they shall not fall upon thee, and brain thee, 1 King. 20.30.
as the (...) of the wall of Aphek did the blasphemous Syrians: as the
towne-house did the insisting, Philistines Judge. 10.30. as the house did Jobs
children etc. or the Homes out of the wall shall not cry out against thee, as
Hab, 2.11. but all creatures shall be thy confederates: not only not hurting,
but helping thee, all that may be. For as they are all armed against the wicked
as rebels and traitors to the divine Majesty: so God has promised to make a
covenant for his Saints with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of
heaven etc. Hos. 2.18. Rebellis facta est; quiz home numini, creatura homini.
Aug.
See the Note there.

And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee] The tame beasts shall
not only not mischieve thee (as some they have done: Euripides the Poet was
torn in pieces with dogs; horses have been the death of many etc.) but shall be
serviceable and profitable unto thee; some alive, not dead, as the dog, horse:
some dead, not alive, as the hog: some both, as the ox, sheep, etc. Ambrose
has a very strange story of a man slain at Antioch by night, by a soldier, in
hope of spoil: this man's dog would not away from his masters dead corpse, but
lay howling by it till daylight, many came in the morning to see that sad
sight, and the murderer among the rest came, that he might be the less
suspected. The dog no sooner saw this soldier, Amb. in Hex^em.
but he ran fiercely at him, and would never give over barking and baiting at
him till he saw him apprehended and carried to prison, where he confessed the
fact, and was for the some deservedly executed.

Verse 24. And thou shall know] Thine own eyes shall see it, and thine
experience seal to it: thou shall be well assured of it: this is a sweet
mercy: it is the sweet-meates of the feast of a good conscience, says Latimer,
to know, that all shall go well with us here, and that our names are written in
the book of life; to be able to conclude from temporal blessings to eternal, as
David does, Psalm. 23.5, 6. to have not only sustentation, but suavities
spiritual, as one speaks.

That thy Tabernacle shall be in peace] i.e. thy house, household, and
household stuff shall be in safety; and all shall be as well with thee as heart
can wish. Or, thy Tabernacle shall be peace. Thou shall be free from
domestical dissensions. It is a sign of a Christian-family, if the son of peace
be there, and peace rest in it, Luke 10.6. This turns water to wine, and the
contrary: where envying and strife is, there is confusion (or unquietness) and
every evil work, Jam. 3.16. such a tabernacle is more like to a kennel of
hounds, then a family of Christians.

And thou shall visit thy habitation] As a busy bishop within thine own
diocese, thou shall carefully enquire into the state of thy family, and take
an account of all that are under thy roof; that God be sincerely served there,
and all things well husbanded, Prove. 27.26, 27.

And shall not sinne] viz. by too much indulgence to children and servants,
Elies sin, who brought up his children to bring down his house: Or, thou shall
not be found guilty, sc. of thy families faults imputed unto thee: or, thou
shall not miss, so. of thy desire and expectation; but all shall go as well
within doors, as heart can wish.

Verse 25. Thou shall know also that thy seed shall be great] Thou shall live
to see thy children (whereof thou art now bereft) not only restored, but
increased. Children are the seed, parents are but the husk, as it were: to have
these multiplied, is no small mercy, Psalm 128.3. especially when the wife is
as the vine, and the children like olive-plants, two of the best fruits; the on
for sweetness, the other for fatness, Judge. 9.13. when they prove to be as
arrows of a strong man, such as whose natural knottinesse is reformed and
smoothed by grace, such as for the workmanship of grace and holiness in their
hearts and lives, are become like the graving of a Kings palace, Psalm 144.12.
What can better preserve Jacob (Job) from confusion, or his face from waxing
pale, than if he might see his children, the work of Gods hands, framed and
fitted by the word in regeneration, and the duties of new obedience? this would
make religious parents of sanctify Gods name, even to sanctify the Holy One,
and with singular encouragement from the God of Israel. Isa. 29.22, 23.

And thine offspring as the grass of the earth] Thy Nephews shall be not
only numerous, but innumerable, they shall also flourish, as grass in its
prime.

Verse 26. Thou shall come to thy grave in a full age] In a good old age, or
(as the Hebrew has it, Genesis 25.8.) with a good hoare head, in an (...), when
thou have even a satiety of life, and art as willing to die as ever thou wast
to dine, or to rise from table after a full meal. The Hebrews made a feast
when they were past 60 years of age: and some of them observe, that the
numerall letters of Chela^h (th^word here used) make up threescore, but that is
not a full old age; rather it is, the beginning of it. Thou shall aye in lusty
old age, so Broughton renders it, old, and yet healthy and comfortable, as was
Moses, Deuteronomy, 34.7. And Mr. Dod that Moses of our times? Of Mr. Samuel Crook
likewise it is recorded, that when he saw no more ability for labors, In his
life by W.G.
he desired to die in a satiety and fullness of life: not as a meat loathed (as
many times natural men do) but as a dish though well liked, that he had fed,
his full of; sew men having ever run so long a race without cessation or
aespitat^^^, so constantly, so unweariably, so unblameably. Lo such an hoary
head, was a crown of glory, as being found in the way of righteousness, Prove.
16.31. But so are not all that yet are long-lived. A sinner may do evil an
hundred times, and yet have his days prolonged, Bccles 8.12. Manasseh had the
longest reign of any King of Judah, (...) Jo^. 22 held the mortality of the
soul, and was otherwise erroneous and vicious, yet he lived longest of any
Pope, and died richest, Anno Dom. 13.35. howbeit he died tempore non suo too
soon for himself, Eccles. 7.17. He went not to his grave in a good old age,
ripe and ready.

As a shock of corn comes in, in his season] As corn when ripe is reaped,
shockt up, and carried into the barn for the masters use. Dei frumentum ego
sum; I am Gods bread-corn, said that ancient Martyr.

Verse 27. Lo this we have searched it, so it is] We are sure that all this is
true, and may be trusted to, for we have tried it: we have it not by
tradition, neither take we it up upon trust from others: but we believe and
know, as Peter spoke Job. 6 69 we believe, and therefore speak it, as Paul
(after David) 2 Cor. 4.13. Psalm. 116.10. Thou majest write upon this whole
chapter, as those Ancients did upon their Oracles (...) God, God, or as John
the Divine did upon his Revelation, These sayings are faithful and true, Rev.
22.6. Vera tanquam ^x tripode, as true as Gospel, as we say. Those that take
upon them to teach others, should go upon sure ground, and be masters of what
they teach; how else will they teach with authority? those also that come to
hear, must strive to find out that which St. Luke calls the certainty of
things, Luke 1.4. and not be led by conjectural suppositions, or the Tenants of
their teachers, but be fully persuaded: verse 1.

Hear it] With utmost attention of body, intention of mind, retention of
memory, and practice, also all is lost.

And know thou it for thy good] Make thy best use of this our diligence and
experience so freely and friendly communicated unto thee. Let not all this that
has been spoken be spilt upon thee, but prove every whit as profitable to
thee, as I conceive it seasonable for thee. Some knowing men are not a button
the better for all they know. The devils are full of objective knowledge, but
they get no good by it: no more do graceless men, that draw not their
knowledge into practice, but detain the truth in unrighteousness, it swimmeth
in their heads, but sinketh not into their hearts; it makes them giddy, as
wine fuming all up into the head, but never coming at the heart to cheer it.
Such a man may cast out devils, and yet be cast to the devil; he may go to hell
with all his unprofitable knowledge; like as a Bull with a coronet and garland
goes to the slaughter. Unless a man hear and know for himself, he shall find
no more comfort of it, then a man does of the Sun when it shines not in his
own Horizon; or then a traveller does of the fatness of a far Country, which
he only passes through, and takes a light view of. If therefore thou be
wise, be wise for thy self, Prove. 9.12. Let thy knowledge be not only
apprehensive, but affective, ^illightning, but transforming (2 Cor. 3 ult.)
discursive, but experimental, and practical. For hereby we know that we know
him, if we keep his commanaments, 1 John 2.3.

CHAP. VI Verse 1. But Job answered and said]
ELiphaz thought he had silenced him, and set him down with so much reason,
that he should have had nothing to reply, yet Job desirous to disasperse
himself, and to clear-up his reputation, answered and said. For indeed
Negligere quid de se quisque sentiat, non solum arragantis est, sed and
dissoluti, says one; that is, altogether to neglect what others think or speak
of a man's self, and not to make apology, is the part not only of a proud, but
of a dissolute person ^ silence sometimes argues guiltiness, or at least it
strengthens suspicion.

Verse 2. O^ that my grief were thoroughly weighed] Heb. were weighed by
weighing. The word rendered grief signifies also Ang^^, and is the same with
that wherewith Eliphaz began his speech, chap. 5.2. where he says, Wrath
kills the foolish man, pointing at Job, as an angry man exalting folly. Here
therefore Job begins his refutation: wishing, that that, anger or grief of
his, so hardly censured, were duly weighed in an even balance for then it
would appear that there was some reason for his passion, that he had enough
upon him to cry for, and that he had not complained without a cause. We read of
a certain Philosopher, who hearing of his sons death, brake out into a loud
lamentation: for which being reproved, Permit^^^e, inquit, ut homo sim, suffer
me, I pray you, (said he) to show my self to be a man; that is, sensible of my
sufferings.

And my calamity laid in the balances together] That is, that my calamity were
accurately set against my grief, my laments and my torments equally poised; it
would then appear that I have not yet grieved or complained up to the height or
weight of those calamities which are upon me. Even to day is my complaint
bitter, (says he elsewhere in answer to Eliphaz too, interpreting his
complaints to be rebellion against God) My stroke is heavier the^ my gro^ning,
chap. 23.2.

Verse 3. For now it would b^ heavier then the sand of the sea] How light
soever thou, O Eliphaz, esteemest it, as being in a prosperous condition. It is
easy to swim in a warm bath: and every bird can sing in a sunshine-day. But
grief lies like a load of lead upon the soul, heavy and cold; afflicting it,
as an unsupportable burden does the body. It so oppressed the poor Israelites
in Egypt, that they had no mind to hearken to Moses, E^e^d, 6.9. Solomon cries
out, A wounded spirit who can bear? Prove. 18.^4. My soul is very heavy, and
exceeding sorrowful, even unto death, says our blessed Savior, Matthew 26.37,
38. then when the Father made all our sins to meet upon him, and be bare our
griefs and carried our sorrowe^, Isa. 13.4, 12. Sure it is, that had he not
been God as well as man, he had been utterly crushed by that unconceivable
weight of sin and wrath that he then groaned under. Oh what will all Christ
less^ persons do in hell, where God shall lay upon them and not spare! they
would feign fly out of his hand, Job 27.22. bur that cannot be.

Therefore my words are swallowed up] Vix loqui possum, vox faucibus haevet: I
want words, which yet, if I had them at will, would be far too weak to utter
the grief of my mind. Broughton renders it, Therefore my words fall short,
they are semesa, says Junius, half-eaten before spoken: I am (as it were)
gagged with grief: or, my words are even smothered up with sighs and sobs. Thus
Job rhetoricates, and yet thinks himself greatly word-bound.

Verse 4. For the arrows of the Almighty are within me] What marvel then
though his flesh had no rest, but he was troubled on every side, since without
were fightings, within were fears, 2 Cor. 7.5. The arrows not of a mighty
man, as Psalm. 127.4. but of an Almighty God, Troubles without, and terrors
within? David felt these arrows, and complains of them heavily, Psalm. 38.1,
2. He shall sh^ot as them with an arrow, suddenly shall they be wounded, says
he of those his enemies who had bent their bow, and shot their arrows at him,
even bitter words, Psalm. 64.3, 7. God will make his arrows drunk with the
blood of such persons, Deuteronomy. 32.42. But the arrows Job here complains of,
were poisoned or invenomed arrows.

The poison whereof drinks up my spirits] Dries them up, and corrupts the
blood in which the spirits are, sprinkling in my veins a mortal poison,
working greatest dolor, and destemper. The Scr^hians and other nations used to
dip their darts in the blood and gall of Asps and Vipers, the venomous heat of
which, like a fire in their flesh, killed the wounded with torments, the likest
hell of any other: and hereunto Job alludeth.

The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me] i. e. the terrible
strokes of God who seems to fight against me with his own hand, to rush upon
me as the Angel once did upon Balaam with a drawn sword in his hand, threatening
therewith to cut off my head, as David did Goliah's, yea to send me packing to
hell in the very suburbs whereof, methinks, I feel to be already, and shall not
I be suffered to complain? a galled shoulder will shrink under a load, though
it be but light; and a little water is heavy in a leaden vessel. But the word
here used for terrors, notes the most terrible terrors, hellish terrors, and
worse, for they are the terrors of God, surpassing great, 2 Cor. 5.11. which
made Jeremy pray so hard, Be not thou a terror to me, O Lord, and then I care
not greatly what befalls me. Whiles I suffer thy terrors, I am distracted,
says Hemun, Psalm 88.15. Add hereunto, that these terrors of God had set
themselves in array, they were in a military manner marshalled and imbattailed
against him, as Jer. 50.9. God afflicted Job methodically and resolvedly; he
led up his army (as a Reverend man phraseth it) exactly formed to a pitched
battle against him, and this was truly terrible; for who, says Moses, knows
the power of his wrath? since the apprehension and approach of it was so
terrible to an upright-hearted Job, to an heroical Luther, upon whom Gods
terrors were so heavy for a time, In epist. ad Melanc.
ut nec calor, nec sanguis, nec sensus, nec vox superesset: that neither heat,
nor blood, nor sense, nor voice remained, but his body seemed dead, as Justus
Jonas an eyewitness reports: agreeable whereunto is that memorable speech
of Luther, Nihil est tentatio vel universi mundi, and totius inferri in unum
conflata etc. The temptation and terror of all the world; nay, of all hell put
together is nothing to that, wherein God sets himself in battle-array
against a poor soul: In which case, that is excellent counsel that one gives
in these words; When thy sins and Gods wrath meeting in thy conscience make
thee deadly sick, as Isai. 33. then power forth thy soul in confession: and as
it will ease thee (as vomiting uses to do) so also it will move God to pity,
and to give thee cordials and comforts to restore thee.

Verse 5. Does the wild ass bray when he has grass?] q. d. Sure they do
not. As if these creatures, wild or tame, want necessary food, you give them
leave to fill the air with their outcries; yea, you supply their wants; but
for me ye will do neither, such is your tenderness and love toward me. Nay, ye
condemn me for that which is naturally common to all creatures. Ye must needs
think I am not without aylement that make such great lamentations, unless ye
conceit that I am fallen below the stirrup of reason, nay, of sense. It is
easy for you who want neither grass nor fodder, or mixed meat. (as the word
signifies) who lie at rack and manger, as it were, and have all that heart can
wish, or need require; it is easy, I say, for you to rest contented, and to
forbear complaints. But why am I so severely censured for impatient, who am
stripped of all, and have nothing left me, praeter coelum and coenum, as he said,
but only air to breath in, and a dunghill to sit on; not to speak of my
inward troubles etc.

Verse 6. Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt?] Or can that which
is unsavory for want of salt be eaten? Hunger will down with unsavory or
unpleasant food, though salt or sauce be wanting: but when meat is putrified
for want of salt, and full or maggots, it will hardly be eaten, unless it be
in extreme famine: it is as if he should say, a man does with no good will feed
upon unsavory or loathsome meats; how then can I use such moderation as you
desire I should, my evils being extreme, sweetened with no kind of comfort, nor
seasoned with any thing that is any way toothsome or wholesome? that I speak
not of your tastelesse and insulse speeches, which are no small vexation to me.

Verse 7. The things that my soul refused to touch etc.] I suffer such torments
even in my very soul, as the very thought of them would heretofore have
affrighted me. Thus Mr. Dio^ate. Others take soul here for the appetite, and
so make this the sense: Those things which I exceedingly loathed, and would
once have thought scorn to have touched, are now my sorrowful meat: I am forced
with an heavy heart to feed upon them for want of better: and they go down the
worse, because you vex me with your hard words (who have little need of such
choke-peares) and will not allow me the liberty of a needful lamentation,
which yet I must needsly take (lest heart should break) and say as before
chap. 3. though with some more respect to God, the object of my present prayer;

Verse 8. O that ^ might have my request!] How heartily begs Job for death, as
a medicine of all his maladies and miseries; as that which would bring him
m^l^rum ademptio^em, ^^^orum, adepti^nem, freedom from all evil, fruition of
all good: By the force of his faith, he looks upon death as the best physician
that would cure him of all infirmities inward and outward, and of all at once,
and for ever. Job might likely be of the same mind that Cha^cer was, who took
for his English motto Farewell Physic; and for his Latin one, Mors arumnarum
requies, death will be a sweet rest from all my labors: the same ^o a believer
death is, that mount Ararat was to Noah, where his ark rested after long
tossing: or as Michel was to David, a means to shift him out of the way when
Saul sent to slay him: or as the fall of the house was to Samson, an end of all
his sorrows and sufferings: hence it is that he rejoices under hope, and with
stretched out neck, looks and longs for deaths coming, as dearly as ever
Sise^a's mother did out of a window for the coming of her son laden with
spoils from the battle. As when death is come indeed, he welcometh it, as Jael
did the fame Sisena (but much in one heartily) with Turn in my Lord, turn in to
me, Judge. 4.18. and further bespeaketh it, as Jacob did his brother Esau, at
their interview; Surely I have seen thy face, as the face of God who has made
thee to meet me with kisses in stead of frowns, and has sent thee to guard me
safe home to my fathers house.

And that God would grant me the thing that I long for.] Or, have long looked
for. Heb. my hope or my expectation as that which will put a period to my
miseries, and possess me of heavens happiness, as that which will be a
postern to let out temporal life, but a street-door to let in eternal.

Verse 9. That ^t would please God to destroy me.] That is, to dispatch me out
of this world, and fend me to a be^ter. A dissolution would be far more
acceptable to Job, then that restitution which Eliph^z seemed to promise him,
chap. 5.24. Its as if Job should say; Take you the world amongst you, since you
like it so well, I have move then enough of it: I am neither fond of life, nor
afraid of death, but the clean contrary: I had rather die then dine, and crave
no greater favor then to have more weight laid upon me that I may die out of
hand. Feri Domine, feri ^nam a peceatis (...) Luther once said, strike Lord,
strike deep, for thou have pardoned my sins, and wilt save my soul.

That he would let loose his hand] That now seems tied, or hound behind him,
Manus ligata vide^u^ quando parcit, says Vatablus. God had chained up Satan,
and strictly charged him not to take away Jobs life: but this is it that Job
would fain have done. Mortality he would account no small mercy: he desired
nothing more then to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, he might do it
because he knew that his Redeemer lived etc. So might Simeon, because he had
seen Gods salvation: and so might Paul who had fought a good fight, and kept
the faith. But how could Plato say in the eighth of his laws, The communion of
the soul with the body is not better then the dissolution, as I would say, if
I were to speak in earnest? (...). Plato.
His master Socrates, when to die, was nothing so confident: for he shut up his
last speech with these words, as both Plato himself, and Cicero tell us, Temp^^
est jam hinc abire^ It is now high time for us to go hence; for me to die, and
for you to live longer: and whether of these two is the better, the gods
immortal know; hominem quidem arbir^or sciro neminem, it is above the
knowledge, I believe, of any man living. Thus he: but Job was better persuaded;
otherwise he would have been better advised then thus earnestly to have desired
death.

And cut me off.] Avide me absumat quasi ex morte mea ingens lucrum
reportatur^^. Let him greedily cut the (...) (so the word signifies) even as
if he were to have some great gain, Pi^eda.
or get some rich booty by my blood.

Verse 10. Thou should I (...) have comfort, yea, I would harden my self in
sorrow etc.] I would take hard on, and bea^ what befalls me as well as I
could, by head and shoulders, had I but hopes of an end by death; as having
this for my comfort;

I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.] I have boldly professed the
true Religion, Ps. 40.10. and 116.10. and 119.43. not ^^ared to preach the
truth sincerely to others for Gods glory, and their good; however you may judge
of me. I never rejected the word of God, but have highly honored it; so that
my desire of death is not desperate, as you may conceive, but an effect of good
assurance that by death heaven advances forward that happy term, when all my
miseries shall end at once: and hence it is, that I am so greedy after the
grave.

Verse 11. What is my strength, that I should hope?] q. d. Thou have told me (O
Eliphaz) that if I frame to a patient and peaceable behavior under Gods
chastisement, I shall go to my grave in a good old age: etc. but, alas, it is
now past time of day with me for that matter: my breath is corrupt, my days
are extinct, the graves are ready for me, chap. 17.1.] Were I as young and
lusty as ever I have been, some such things as ye have promised me might be
hoped for; but alas, the map of age is figured on my forehead, the calenders
of death appear in the furrows of my face: besides my many sores and
sicknesses, which if they continue but a while, will certainly make an end of
me.

And what is mine end] i.e. The later part of my life: what is that else, but
trouble and sorrow? see this elegantly set forth by Solomon, Eccles. 12.2, 3,
4, etc.

That I should prolong my life] That I should desire my life to be prolonged or
eeked out to that? De re r^st. lib. 1. cap. 1.
Rather let it be my ^are with Varro, ut sarcinas colligam antequam proficiscar
e vita, to be ready for death, which seems so ready for me.

Verse 12. Is my strength the strength of stones? Or, Is my flesh of brass?]
Is it made of marble, or of the hardest metal? as it is said of one in Homer,
that he was (...), of brazen bowls, and of Julius Scaliger, that he had a
golden soul in an iron body: he was a very Iron sides, but so was not Job: he
had neither a body of brass, nor sinews of iron, to stand out against so many
storms, and bear so many batteries; he felt what he endured, and could not
long endure what he felt. As for the damned in hell, they are by the power of
God upheld for ever, that they may suffer his fierce wrath for ever; which else
they could never do. And as for those desperate Assasines, Baltasar Gerardus
the Burgundian, who slew the Prince of Orange Anno Dom. 1584. and Ravilliac (
Ferale illud prodigium, as one calls him, that hideous hel^hound) who slew
Henry the fourth of France in the midst of his preparations, and endured
thereupon most exquisite torments; this they did out of stupidity of sense, not
solidity of faith; and from a wretchlesse desperation, not a confident
resolution.

Verse 13. Is not my help in me?] Have I not something within wherewith to
sustain me amidst all my sorrows, viz. the testimony of my conscience, that
in simplicity and godly sincerity, I have had my conversation in the world, 2
Cor. 1.12. ^o, this is my rejoicing, this is my cordial etc. Innuit innocentiam
suam, a^ vita integritatem, says Drusius: he means the innocence and
integrity of his heart, and this was the help Job knew he had in store, this
was the wisdom or right reason he speaks of in the following words, and is
wisdom (or virtue) driven quite from me? no, no; that holds out and abides
when all things else in the world pass away and vanish^, as the word Tushijah
imports. Job had a subsistence still: for his life consisted not in the
abundance which he had possessed, but was now bereft of. The world calls
wealth substance, but God gives that name to Wisdom only. The world he
sets forth by a word that betokens change, for its mutability, Prove. 3.8.
and the things thereof he calls Non-entia, Prove. 23.5. Will thou set thine
eyes, says he, upon that which is not? and which has no price but what
opinion sets upon it? Grace being a particle of the divine nature, is
unloosable, unperishable. -- Virtus post funera venit.

Verse 14. To him that is afflicted] Heb. melted, viz. in the furnace of
affliction, which melts men's hearts, and makes them malleable, as fire does
the hardest metals, Psalm. 22.15. Josh. 7.5.

Pity should le showed from his friend] By a sweet tender melting frame of
spirit, such as was that of the Church, Psalm. 102.13. and that of Paul, 2 Cor.
11.29. Who is weak^ and I am not weak, sc. by way of sympathy? who is offended,
and I burn not? when others are hurt, I feel twinges; as the tongue
complains for the hurt of the toe, and as the heart condoleth with the heel,
and there is a fellow-feeling amongst all the members: so there is likewise i^
the mystical body.

From his friend] who is made for the day of adversity, Prove. 17.17. and should
show love at all times, (...). Et cum fortuna statque cadisque fides.
and especially in evil times: but poor Job bewaileth the want of such
faithful friends. David also complains to God (his only fast friend) of
those that would be the causes, but not the companions of his calamity, that
would fawn upon him in his flourish, but forsake him in his misery, My lovers
and friends stand aloof etc. they looked on him, and so passed by him as the
Priest and the Levite did the wounded passenger, Luke 10.32. But God takes it
ill that any should once look upon his afflicted, unless it be to pity and
relieve them, Obad. 12.13. and has threatened an evil, an only evil, without
the least mixture of mercy, to such as show no mercy to those in misery, Jam.
2.13.

But he has forsaken the fear of the Almighty] Which wheresoever it is in the
power of it, frames a man to all the duties both of piety and charity. O^adiah
feared God greatly, and it well appeared by his pity to the persecuted
Prophets. Cornelius feared God, and (as a fruit of it) gave much alms. Acts
10.2. Not so Nabal, that saplesse fellow, whose heart was hardened from Gods
holy fear: nor Judas the traitor, who had no bowels of compassion toward his
innocent master; and therefore he burst in the midst w^^h an huge crack, and
all his bowels gusht out, by a singular judgment, (...)
Acts 1.18. There are many other readings of this text, as that of the ^igurine
translation, It were fit for friends to show kindness to their friend that is
in misery: but the fear of the Almighty has forsaken me, as you please to
say. See what Eliphaz had said to this purpose, chap. 4.6. with the Note.
Others read it thus, to him that is afflicte^ should reproach be given, that he
has forsaken the fear of the Almighty? q.d. Must a man therefore be reviled
as irreligious, because he is calamitous? The vulgar translation runs thus,
He that takes away pity from his friend, has forsaken the fear of the
Almighty etc.

Verse 15. My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brooke] Even you, whom I
esteemed as my brethren (for to them he applies this speech, verse 21.) prove
hollow and helpless to me: like the river Araris, that moves so slowly, that
it can hardly be discerned, says Caesar, whether it flow forward or backward:
or rather, Cas. de bell. Gal. l. 1.
to a certain fish in that river Araris, called Scolopidus: which at the
waxing of the Moon, is as white as the driven snow; and at the wayning thereof
is as black as a burnt coal. Job here elegantly compares them not to a river
which is fed by a spring, and has a perennity of flowing; but to a brook
arising from rain or melted snow, the property whereof is, in a moisture (when
there is least need of them) to swell; in a drought (when they should do good)
to fail. It is reported of the river Novanus in Lombardy, that at every
mid-summer-solstice it swells and runs over the banks, but in mid-winter
is quite dry. Such were Jobs deceitful brethren; good summer-birds etc. The
same Author tells us, that in that part of Spain called Carrinensis, Plin.
lib. 2. cap. 103. Idem ibid.
there is a river that shows all the fish in it to be like gold: but take them
into thine hand, and they soon appear in their natural kind and color. Job
found that all is not gold that glistereth.

And as the stream of brooks they pass away] i. e. as an impetuous land-flood,
they fail me; and now, that I have most need of their refreshments, they yield
me none; but the contrary rather: like as land-floods by their sudden and
violent overflow do much hurt many times to corn and cattle. I can go to
these streams of brooks, says Job, and show my friends the face of their
hearts in those waters.

Verse 16. Which are blackish by reason of the ice] Or frost, a black-frost we
call it, which deceives those that tread upon it. Or if hard enough to bear
up passengers it promise to be a storehouse of preserving snow and water
against the scortching time of Summer, yet there is no trusting to it: for these
waters as they are in winter locked up with frosts, so they will be in Summer
exhaled, and dried up by the Sun.

Verse 17. What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot etc.] Lo such
is the fruit of creature-confidence, of making flesh our arm, of trusting in
men or means; whereas Deo co^fisi nunquan confusi, they that trust in the Lord
shall never be disappointed. This thou can never do, unless (unbottomed of
thy self and the creature) thou so lean upon the Lord, as that if he fail thee
thou sinkest, and not otherwise.

Verse 18. The paths of their way are turned aside.] i. e. They being (as it
were) cut into diverse small rivers running here and there, by little and
little, Beza.
and being resolved into vapors, at length quite vanish away.

They go to nothing and perish] Metaph^ra insignis and Hieroglyphicum, says an
Interpreter; this is an excellent metaphor, and a lively picture of the vanity
of such as make a great show of piety and charity, which yet flows not from
the spring of true faith; and therefore cannot but, after a while, go to
nothing and perish. A failing brook, says another, is a clear emblem of a
false heart, both to God and man. Lavat^r thus explaineth the comparison: 1. As
brooks run with waters then when there is least need of them: so falfe friends
are most officious when their courtesy might best be spared. 2. As the ice of
such brooks is so condensed and hardened, that it bears men, horses, and
other things of great weight, so counterfeit friends promise and pretend to be
ready to do their utmost to suffer any thing for our good and comfort. 3. But
as those brooks are dried up in summer, and frozen up in winter, so that we
can set no sight on them: in like sort these are not to be found when we are in
distress and affliction. 4. As brooks in winter are covered with snow and ice:
so these would seem to be whiter then snow when their a^fections toward us are
colder then ice. 5. Lastly, as the ice that was hard and firm, upon a thaw
breaks and melts: so false friends leave us many times upon very small or
no dislikes; as being constant only in their unconstancy.

Verse 19. The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them]
The troops, that is, the travelers, the Caravan or company of merchants from
those parts, passing through dangerous and dry deserts, expected relief from
those brooks which they had marked out for themselves against summer: But with
what success?

Verse 20. They were confounded, because they had hoped etc.] Heb. They
blushed, or they were abashed, because disappointed and defeated of their hope
and expectation. See Jer. 14.3, 4. Joel 1.10, 11. Gods people have a promise,
that hoping in him they shall never be ashamed, Joel 2.26. Rom 9.23 Their hope
is unfallible Romans 5.5. because founded upon ^aith unfeigned, 1 Timothy 1.5. Hence
they are commanded to rejoice in hope, Romans 12.12. and to conceive gaudium in
re, gaudium in spe, gaudium de possessi^e, gaudium de promissione etc. joy for
what they have in hand, and in present possession; joy also for what they have
in hope, and in reversion. Wicked men's hopes may hop headless (as the proverb
is, and as these troops of T^ma experimented) they come to the worlds
felicities, as they do to a lottery with heads full of hopes, but return with
hearts full of blanks; not so the Saints: God will be better to them then their
hopes: and when at worst, they can confidently say, it is well for the present,
and it will be better hereafter.

Verse 21. For now ye are nothing] i. e. To me nothing worth: I have no more
joy of you then if you were not at all: ye are not unlike him who said to his
friend, I am all yours, except body and goods: ye are not so much as friends at
a sneez^, who will come out with a God bless you: or as those great
benefactors in St. James, chap. 2.15, 16. that were free of their mouth-mercy:
ye are mere mutes and ciphers, nullities, as to me just nothing; that is, ye
are no such thing as I expected. And here Job brings the foregoing similitude
home to his friends by close application. And according to the Hebrew margin
called Keri, it may be rendered, Fuistis ^i similes^, sc. Torrenti; ye are like
to it, that is, to the brook forementioned: ye fail me as much as it did the
thirsty passengers. Drus.


For ye see my casting down, and are afraid] There is an elegancy in the
Original that cannot be englished: your eyes see what you had before heard of
only be the hearing of the ear, that I am at a great under, dejected and
impoverished: you are therefore afraid of me, lest I should ask you something
for the supply of my wants; or else you keep at a distance, as more afraid of
catching mine evil, then desirous of curing it; ye visit me, but are not moved
with any compassion toward me. So the Septuagint. Horrore perculsi r^si^atst i^
a me veluti si quispiam vip^ram calcasset. Lav.


Verse 22. Did I say, bring unto me? or give etc.] Did I ever charge you for my
reparation or redemption? This interrogation is more emphaticall then a simple
negation, q. d. I never did it, and therefore unless you had been at more
charge with me, you should have bestowed better words upon me: those would have
cost you nothing certainly.

Verse 23. Or deliver me from the enemies hand etc. Rescue me, ransom me from
those that have robbed and wronged me: fetch back my loft goods by price of
force. The word rendered mighty, signifies also formidable, terrible,
breac^-makers. The word is opened by St. Paul, Phil. 1.28. Where he uses a
metaphor from horses, s^or^ing, (...).
and starting when ^^^gh^ed.

Verse 24. Teach me, and I will hold my tongue] If I be in an error, I am
willing to be rectified. Hitherto you have mistook my case, and so your speech
has been to small purpose. But if you will come home to my case indeed, and
weigh things in an even balance, I shall gladly submit to your more mature
judgment and direction. Teach me, and you shall find that I am not indocible,
that I am not as horse and (...) that have no under standing Psalm 32.9. nor
will learn any muchlesse then the creature called Rhinoceros, untameable and
untractable. It shall appear to you that I am not utterly uncounsel^able, as
those of whom Bail complains, qui q^id verum sit neque sciunt, neque sustine
dis^e^e, that neither know what truth and right is, nor will endure to be
taught it. Job was not to be told that it was easier to deal with twenty men's
reasons, then with one man's will! Epist. ad E^^gr. 10.
he promises therefore not to stand out against his friends, because he will
stand out. It is not my will, says he, that opposes what you have spoken, but
my understanding. I am a slave to right reason: and if convinced thereby, I
shall soon lay down the bucklers. Teac^ me, and I will hold my tongue, and not
strive for the last word to lengthen out the contention: I am willing to
reason, but not to wrangle. See Prove. 30.32.

Cause me to understand wherein I have erred] An humble man will never be an
heretic* err he may (that is common to mankind, iriste mortali at is
privilegium) but convince him by solid reasons, and good arguments, and he will
not long stand out; (...) child shell lead him, Isa. 1^ 6 It is by pride that
contention comes, Prove. 13.10. for it makes a man drunk with his own conceit,
Hab. 2.5. and who so wilful, so quarrelsome as he that is drunk? An heretic
may be condemned of himself, Tim 3^.10. but he will not be convinced by another
(such is his pertinacy, or rather, obstinacy) no, though he be stoned with
hardest arguments, holden out of that crystal-brook of the holy Scriptures, he
stands as a stake in the midst of a stream: and you may as soon remove a rock,
Lapidandi sunt b^r^tiel. Ath^n.
as cause him to understand wherein he is out in his judgment or practice.

Verse 25. How forcible are right words!] How sweet, says the Chaldee
interpreting it by Psalm. 119.103. It may be he read Nimle su for Nimre su; but
the word is well rendered forcible, potent, valid. It notes also, says one,
acrimony, sharpness, or smartnesse, because right words have a pleasing
acrimony upon the palate of the soul, and a power upon the judgment to sway
and carry it. Mr. Caryl.
(...) dictis animos etc. Audite s^nem juvenes qu^m juvenem sen^s audierunt;
these few words from Augustus falling right, quieted the mutineers in his army:
and the like is reported of Alexander the great, of Menenius Aggripp^ etc. But
we have better instances, as that of Abig^ treating with David; the woman of
Abel with J^ab; Nicodemus by a few seasonable words, dissolving the Council
gathered together against Christ, John 7.50 53. Pap^nutius stickling for the
married Clergy at the Nicene Council, etc. One seasonable truth falling on a
prepared heart, has often a strong and sweet operation. Luther having heard
Sta^picius say that that is kind repentance with begins from the love of God,
ever after that time the practice of repentance was sweeter to him; This speech
also of his tool well with Luther. The doctrine of predestination begins at
the wounds of Christ: but before any of this, he was much wrought upon by
conference with an old Priest about justification by faith. So was that Italian
Marquess Galeacius Caracci^lus by a similitude used by Pe^er Martyr reading
upon the first to the Corinthians Nescio quid divinum in auscultatione est,
says one, there is a kind of divine force and efficacy in hearing, more then
in reading the word we may say of it as David once did of Goliahs sword, There
is none to th^^. And yet it cannot be denied, that the word read also has a
mighty force and powerful influence upon the conscience. Hence those many
praises of it, Psalm. 19.7, 8. The statutes of the Lord are right and. right for
every man^ (...) and purpose ^o penned, that every man may think they speak d^
se in re sua^ of himself in his particular case, as (...) has it. So right the
good word of God is and suitable; how then can it be but forcible (see Heb.
4.12. 2 Cor. ^.4, 5.) And how forcible it is none can tell but those that have
(...) it; nor those neither: (...) this ^^pression by way of (...) Oh (...)
^ffectual are right words.

But what does your (...)] Heb. What does your (...)? What force, what energi^
is in your argument? how (...) and (...) they? (...) appear they? and how
little to the (...) Ta^^ fa^^^^ dil^^ntur argumenta vestra, quam v^lp^s co^est
pyrum. I can (...) off my hand. Strong is the Truth (I grant) and (...)
e^^nceth the things that are true; but to conclude truths from (...) (is that I
am an hypocrite because afflicted) that ye can never do.

Verse 26. Do ye imagine to reprove words?] (...) and hasty words, which have
more sound then sense? Think you that I do only make a noise, or rave like a
mad than, and a^ accordingly to be dealt with? ye have not hitherto had (...),
windy words from me, bur words full of weight and matter, words of truth and
(...) wherefore then do ye speak thus? Do ye imagine to reprove words?

And the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? Do ye think I
speak like one that is distracted, who knows not what he speakes^ of that I
have at once lost my hope and my wits? It is an easy and a compendious way of
refuting (...) a man can say, to say, he is mad, his words must needs be but
without weight, who is himself without reason. Mr. Broughton reads, Do ye
(...) the (...) of the (...) wind? shall the poor man's wisdom be despised (as
Solomon asks) and his words not be heard? Ecc, 9.16 Some refer this also to
J^b friends, (...) it thus, Ye frame (...) only to reprove (ye are good for
little else but to find fault) and bring forth words against the wind: ye beat
the empty air with your bubbles of words, and senseless saying^.

Verse 27. (...), you overwhelm the fatherl^sse] Heb. ye throw your selves upon
the fatherless, that is, upon miserable ^e, who am helpless, comfortless.
See Genesis 43.18. that he may (...) himself upon us, and fall upon us, say they
there, as hunters and wild beasts fall upon their prey.

And you, dig a p^^ for your friend] Who had better deserved of you, and
expected better usage from you. Here he taxes them for craft, as before for
cruelty, and this to their friend, whom they sought to circumvent, and to drive
into desperation. Some read the words thus, you make a feast upon your fr^end;
you banquet upon your companion, and make great cheer, as being glad of my
calamity which you make an argument of mine impiety. See chap. 41 6. 2 King^
6.23.

Verse 28. Now therefore be c^ntent, lo^k upon me] Let it suffice you to have
thus hardly handled me; cast now a more benign aspect upon me, and be not
henceforth so hot, and so harsh. Now therefore be content regard me: so Mt.
Broughton translateth it; or look upon me, sc. with a critical eye: what
guiltiness can you find in my face? do I look like an hypocrite, and can you
read my conscience in my countenance?

It (...) to you if (...)] You may soon see mine integrity if you plea^^^ for
my heart fitteth and shows it felt in my forehead, neither can I collude; I
am one of those children, that will not lie; So be God my Savior, Isa 63 8.

me; B^na ver^^ (...): what need all this heat of speech, and ^eight of spirit
he ^etter advised, I beseech you, ch^p 17.10. and 19.28. some think that Jobs

judgment to be given up to an injudicious mind. Rom 1.28. a reprobate (...).

CHAP. VII. Verse 1. Is there not an appointed time to m^n upon the earth?]
THere is certainly: Our bounds are prescribed us; and a pillar set by him who
bears ^p the heavens, which we are not to transpasse. Stat sua cuique dies,
(said the He^then Poet; our last day stands, the rest run. It is said of the
Turks, Virg. Aeneid. 10. Sr. H. Blounts Voyage into Levant. Humanae vitae
terminus non est de^reto simplici and absoluto (...) Heming.
that they shun not the company of those that have the prague, but pointing
upon their foreheads ^ay, it was written there at their birth when they should
die. Now if there be an appointed time etc. what mean the Lutherans to teach
that God has not determined the period of men's days, but it is in man's power
to lengthen or shorten them: In this one verse we have two metaphors, both
which do evince the contrary. The (...) is from soldiers, employed in the word
(...) translated an appointed time, or a warfare, because there was a set time
for soldiers to fight, and a set time also for them to serve. The second is
from an (...).

Are not his days also like the days of an (...)?] De^cribit humanae vitae
brevitatem, says Vatablus. Here he describes the shortness of man's life, and
withal that his days are determined, for with an hireling we agree to work
with us for a certain time, and usually for a day, or by the day; and hence we
call them day-labourers. It imports, then that the time of man's life is short
and set: for hirelings are appointed to an hour. See Job 14.14. Eccles. 2.3.
John 7.30. Isa. 38.5. Fifteen years just were added to Hezekiahs life: our
hairs are (...), much more our days. This Job alleges to set forth his own
extreme misery, as one condemned to (...) torment without any respite or
refreshing: and therefore in a worse case then any soldier or servant.

Verse 2. As a servant earnestly desires the shadow etc.] Heb. gapeth after,
or gaspeth for the (...) that is, for some place of cool repose after his hard
labor in the hot sunshine, as in harvest; or for the shadow, that is; for
dark night, or for the evening.

Cum (...) discedens (...). And (...) for the reward of his work] Heb.
expects his work, Virg. Eclog.
that is, his ^^ges. Gods work is its own wages: and in doing thereof (not only
for doing thereof) there is great reward, Psalm. 19.11. Righteousness is its
own recompense; (...) for his wages, he sets his heart upon it, Deuteronomy. (...) and
God provideth there, that it be duly paid him: and those that detain (...),
see Jam. 5.4. it is a ^rying (...). The whole verse may cohere (...), and be
thus ^endred, Is not man as a servant that earnestly desires the shadow and is
he not as an (...) that looks for the reward of his Work? ^ut it is better to
(...) with that when follows, according to our ^ranslation.

Verse 3. So (...) months of vanity] So, but a great deal worse (...). The
laboring servant has his shade; the painful (...); But I am shade to (...),
or have assigned to me for (...), But whole months of vanity, that is, of
molestation and misery, (...) of the l^ast comfort o^ hope or amendment. The

mentioned (...) some render (...) it may be gathered that Jobs calamities
lasted a long time, twelve months, say the Hebrews, seven years, says (...)
in any sort, we think our (...). For Months of vanity some read (...) ever in
the Eclipse.

And wearisome nights are appointed to me.] sc. by God: and that so exactly as
if he had numbered them to a night. See Dan. 10.1. Pondere, mensura, ^^mero Deus
omnia fecit: It is he that cutteth us out our conditions, that prepares for us
troublesome days and tiresome nights, and purposely that he may take us off
from the inordinate love of life: like as by strait binding (which mortifieth
and deadeth the flesh) men are made more able to bear the cutting off of a
member; so shall we take our cutting off from this world the more gently, by
how much the more painful, pinching days and nights we have endured.

Verse 4. When I, lie down, I say, when shall I arise etc.] Here is a
graphicall description of a wearisome night. The night is most laborious and
irksome to sick people^ then they revolve their troubles, and being free from
visits of friends, they visit their own afflictions, and study their own
distempers freely, then they lie all night wishing for day, telling the clock
harkening for the cock (that natural cloc^) tossing to and fro unto the dawning
of the day, not able to gee the least wink of sleep, that nurse of nature, and
sweet parenthesis of men's griefs and cares. Oh present the condition of a
restless sick man to your thoughts, (says an Interpreter here) praise God for
quiet nights, and pity those to whom wearisome nights are appointed.

Verse 5. My flesh is clothed with worms.] Here Job shows how and whence his
nights were so wearisome and restless: he was in his grave-clothes before he
died (says one) viz. Mr. Caryl.
a gown of worms set or embroidered with clods of dust. Covered he was with
sores, and putrified ulcers full of worms, which made him an abhorring to
himself.

And clods of dust] A fit dress for a dying man. The word signifies, the
filings of any metal, or the scrapings of an unclean thing. He means then
the scurfe, scraped off from him, or the dust contracted by his sitting upon
the ground, chap. 2.8.

My skin is broken] Or, cleft and chapt (as the earth is in drought) in most
loathsome and formidable manner.

And become loathsome] Or melted, as in that distemper which Physicians call
corruptionem totius substantiae: or as in the leprosy or gangrene, when the
flesh falls off from the bones. Hinc igitur disce patientiam in morbis, says
Lavater. Hence then learn to be patient under the most noisome and troublesome
diseases. What sit, not lie, nor live, nor die: was not this holy Jobs
condition, and worse? Remember that there are not a few sick as heart can hold;
sore all over, and want necessary food and physic which thou do not:
consider that God could, and justly might lay more and heavier plagues upon
thee, etc. When Dr. Munster was sick, and some friends came to visit him, being
very sorry for the pains he was put to lay the ulcers of his body; O my dear
friends, said he, these biles and blaines gemmae sun^ and pr^tiosa ornamenta
Dei, are Gods gemmes and Jewels wherewith he adorneth his friends, that he may
draw them to himself, which ornaments let us esteem far more precious then all
the gold and wealth of this whole world; soon after which speech, Job. Manl.
loc. com. 127. Melch. Adam.
he piously and peaceably fell asleep in the Lord. graserus also when he saw
his body begin to swell with a dropsy, and other distempers, Euge Deo sit laus
and gloria, said he, Oh blessed be God, that my deliverance is at hand, and
hor^la gratissima, and that sweet hour that shall put an end to all my miseries.

Verse 6. My days are (...)] Which is of a very swift and sudden motion.
Nights and days pass the (...) of (...) life forward and backward, to and
again. The right casts it to the day, and the day to the night; between these
two, time quickly wears off the thread of life. I (...) cut off like a weaver,
my life says good Hezekiah, Isa. 38.12. And the (...) this in their fiction of
the three sister-Destinies, whereof the Poet says, Clotho colum bajulat,
Lachesi^ trahi^, Atropos (...)

You that are weavers, says Lavater, (...) of this text, and learn to live
holily.

And they are spent without hope] Heb. in not hope. I cannot (...) that I shall
ever recover, or be (...): whatever thou, O Elip^^^, have, (...) about (...)
put me in hope. All Jobs desire was death, which he looked upon as the (...)
remedy of all.

Verse 7. O remember that my life is wind] Before swifter or lighter then a
weavers shuttle (or then a word or speech, as the Septuagint there render it)
now, (...).
my life is a wind, or as a wind (so the Chaldee paraphraseth) that speedily
passes away, and returns not. So St. James, What is your life? says he; It
is even a vapor, that appears for a little time, and th^n vanishes away.
Jam. 4.14. One has well observed, that the Holy Ghost gives us very may Items
of this (and especially in this book) which shows, that we are very apt to
forget it. A point this is easy to be known, but very hard to be believed:
every man assents to it, but few live it, and improve it to reformation.

Mine eyes shall no more s^e good] sc. in this world, for in the world to come
he was confident of the beatificall vision, chap. 19.27. Hezekiah has a like
expression when sentenced to die: I said in the cutting off of my days; I
shall not see the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living; (that is, in
this life present, Psalm. 27.13. and 52 5. and 142.5. Isa. 53.8. called also the
light of the living, John 9.4. Psalm. 56.13.) I shill behold man no more with
the inhabitants of the world, Isa. 38.11. And this, both sick Job, and sick
Hezekiah tell the Lord, and both of them begin alike with O remember, Isa.
38.3. God forgets not his people and their condition: howbeit he requires
and expects that they should be his Remembrancers for their own and others
good, Isa. 62.6, 7. See the Margin.

Verse 8. The eye of him that has seen me, shall see me no more] In death we
shall neither see, nor be seen, but be soon both out of sight and out of mind
too. It is storied of Richard the third, that he caused the dead corpse of his
two smothered Nephews to be closed in lead, and so put in a coffin full of
holes, and hooked at the ends with two hooks of iron, and so to be cast into a
place called the Black-deeps, Speed 935.
at the Thames mouth, whereby they should never rise up, nor be any more seen.
Such a place is the grave till the last day: for then the sea shall give up the
dead which are in it, and death ad he grave shall render up the dead that are
in them, Rev. 20.13. then shall Adam see all his nephews at once etc.

Thine eyes are upon me, and I am not] Thou even look me to death; like as
elsewhere God is said to frown men to destruction, Psalm 80.16. and Psalm
104.29. they are not able to endure his flaming eyes, sparkling out wrath
against them. What mad men therefore are they that speak and act against Him
who can so easily do them to death? If God but set his eyes upon them for evil
(as he often threatens to do, Amos 9.4. Job 16.9.) they are undone.

Verse 9. As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away] A cloud is nothing else
but a vapor thickened in the middle Region of the air by the cold
encompassing and driving it together, psalm 18.19. vessels they are as thin as
the liquor that is in them; but some are waterlesse: the former are soon
emptied and dissolved; the later as soon scattered by the wind, and vanish
away. See the Note on verse 7.

So he that goes down to the grave shall come up no more,] sc. to live and
converse here with men, as ver. 10. Or he shall come up no more, sc. without a
miracle (as Lazarus and some others long since dead rose again) he cannot
return to me, said David of his deceased child, 2 Samuel 12.23. God could send
some from the dead to warn the living; but that is not now to be expected, as
Abraham told the rich man, Luke 16. Those spirits of dead men that so often
appeared in times of Popery (requiring their friends to sing Masses and Dirges
for them; and that drew this verse from Theodorus Gaza, sunt aliquid manes,
lethum non omnia finit) were either delusions, or else devils in the shape of
men. That Job doubted of the Resurrection, or denied it, (as Rabbi Solomon, and
some other, both Hebrew and Greek writers conclude from this text) is a
manifest injury done to this good man, and a force offered to the text, as
appears by that which next follows.

Verse 10. He shall return no more to his house] Either to dispatch businesses,
or to enjoy comforts: he has utterly done with the affairs of this world.
Melanchthon tells of an aunt of his, who having buried her husband, and
sitting sorrowfully by the fires side, saw (as she thought) her husband coming
into the room, and talking to her familiarly about the payment of certain
debts, and other businesses belonging to the house: and when he had thus talked
with her a long time, he bid her give him her hand; she at first refused, but
was at length persuaded to do it: he taking her by the hand so burnt it, that
it was as black as a coal, and so he departed. Was not this the devil?

Neither shall his place know him any more] His place of habitation, or his
place of honor and ruledome: these shall no more acknowledge him, and welcome
him back, as they used to do after a journey. Death is the conclusion of all
worldly comforts and relations. Hence wicked people are so loath to depart,
because there is struck by death an everlasting parting-blow betwixt them and
their present comforts, without hope of better. spes and fortuna valete, said
one great man at his death. Cardinal Burbon would not part with his part in
Paris for his part in paradise. Fie, said another rick Cardinal, will not
death be hired? will money do nothing? Never did Adam go more unwillingly out of
paradise, the Jebusites out of the strong-hold of Zion, the unjust steward out
of his office, or the devils out of the demoniack, then graceless people do
out of their earthly tabernacles, because they know they shall return no more;
and having hopes in this life only, they must needs look upon themselves as
most miserable.

Verse 11. Therefore I will not refrain my mouth.] Heb. I will not prohibit
my month, sc. from speaking, I will bite in my grief no longer: but, since
death, the certain end of all outward troubles, is not far from me; I will
by my further complaints, press the Lord to hasten it, and not suppress my
sorrows, but give them a vent.

I will speak in the anguish of my spirit] Heb. In the straitness or
distress of my spirit, which is almost suffocated with grief.

I will complain in the bitterness my soul.] his greatest troubles were
inward: and if by godly sorrow for his sins he had powered forth his soul in
an humble confession (as some understand him here) he had taken a right course:
but thus boisterously to break out into complaints, savoureth of humane
infirmity, and shows quantae sint hominis vires sibi a Deo derelicti, what a
poor creature man is when God leaves him to himself, Mercer.
and subjecteth him to his judgments.

Verse 12. Am I a sea, or a whale] Can I bear all troubles, as the sea receives
all waters, and the whale bears all tempests? This (as is well observed) was
too bold a speech to God from a creature: for when his hand is on our backs,
our hands should be upon our mouths, as Psalm 39.9. I was dumb, or (as others
read it.) I should have been dumb -- because thou did it. But it is a fair
step to perfection and victory, when one can kiss Gods rod and say, as Psalm
44.17. All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, nor declined
from thy way. Job was not without his impatiencies: but being he was right for
the maine, and at length bewailed them, God looked not upon him as he does upon
those refractaries, who to their impatience add impenitence; and to their
passive disobedience, active.

That thou set test a watch over me?] That thou surroundest me with sorrows,
and wilt not suffer me to die? Psalm. 191. ^sal. 141.3.
Here Job should have set a better watch over his lips then thus boisterously
to have blustered against God (who is (...), not to be called to an account for
his proceedings) like the raging sea, or unruly whirle-poole. He should have
considered, that the best men have somewhat of the sea in them, that must be
bounded; and somewhat of the whale, that must be watched and kept under: and
that God never lays more upon a man then there is need, though he may think
otherwise.

Verse 13. When I say, my bed shall comfort me] The bed was the most proper and
probable means of refreshment: but it is not the bed that can give sleep, nor
the couch, ease. Creatures are not able of themselves to give out the comforts
committed to them: their common nature must be assisted with a special word of
blessing, or else they do us no good: Man lives not by bread only etc. God
makes the merciful man's bed, Psalm 41.3. So he gives his beloved sleep, quiet
sleep: ( Shena with an A^eph quiescent:) Psalm. 127. He is the God of all
mercies, and the Father of all consolation, 2 Cor. 1.3. It is he that shines
through the creature, which else is but as the air, without light. Look now
the air lights us not without the Sun; nor fuel heats us not without fire: so
neither can any man or means comfort or content us without God.

My couch shall ease my complains] Heb. Shall lift up, or take away, viz. the
burden of my cares and grief: some part of my load at least: but it fell out
otherwise: for

Verse 14. Then thou skarest me with dreames] Extremam tentationem describit,
says Vatablus; and the devil doubtless, had a great hand in this business,
(for it was within his commission, and he would not neglect any part of it;)
but Job takes notice of none but God the chief agent, and to him he applies
himself. His providence is exercised even about dreams, which in melancholy
people, fall out (especially when they are sick) to be oftentimes very horrid
and hideous; as that they fall down from some high place, commit some capital
offense, are slain, torn in pieces by devils etc. Bishop Foliots terrible
night-vision was before mentioned. Richard the third after the murder of his
two innocent Nephews, and Charles the ninth of France after the Parisian
massacre had such dreadful dreams; that they became a terror to themselves and
to all about them. But to instance in better men; Beza in vitae.
Calvin in the year of grace 1562 being sick of the gout, dreamed, that he
heard a great noise of drums beaten up most vehemently, as they use to be in
warlike marches. Pareus also Anno 1618 saw in a dream the City of Heidelberg
set on fire in may places, and the Prince Electors palace all on a light flame:
this he set down the next morning in his day-book, and added these words, O
Deus clementissime averte sinistrum omen etc. Such fearful dreams cause a sick
sleep, and a worse waking. This Job complains of here: Philip. Par. in vita
Patris.
and yet more fully in the next words.

Verse 15. So that my soul chooses strangling] i. e. Quamvis durissimam sed
praesentissimam mortem, any violent or ignominious death, so it were a speedy
death. Hippocrates tells us, that may have been so affrighted with dreams and
apparitions, that they have hanged themselves, leaped into deep pits, or
otherwise made themselves away. Let those that either have not been so
terrified, or so tempted, or so deserted of God, bless him for that mercy.

And death rather then life] Heb. Rather then my bones; that is, any kind of
death rather then such a body, which is no nothing else but a bag of bones: or
then such rotten bones full of sores and ulcers: he makes mention of his
bones, because his pain had pierced as far as his very bones; the
putrefaction had sunk down into his marrow.

Verse 16. I loath it, I would not live alway] I loath or abhor it, that is, my
life, or I loath them, that is, my bones, verse 15. I would not live always,
that is, Aug. de civitato Dei, l. 9. c. 10.
long in this world, and in this condition. Plotinus the Philosopher held it a
special mercy of God to men, that they were mortal; and did not always live to
labor under the miseries of this wretched life. Ca^o professed, that if he
might have his age renewed as the Eagles, so that he might be made young again,
he would seriously refuse it. Cic. Cato Major
How much better might Job say thus, since the righteous has hope in his death;
and might well take up that of the Poet.

Vsque adeone mori miserum est? The days of the best are so full of evil both
of sin and pain, that it is good they are not fuller of days; if they should
have length of life added to heaps of sorrows, and perpetuity with all their
misery; how miserable were they! Christ promises it as a point of favor to
his, that the days of trouble should be shortened, Matthew. 24.22. and that he
may put an end to the world, he dispatcheth away the generations with all the
convenient speed that may be.

Therefore let me alone] Some read thus, I cannot live for ever, or very long,
Quod cito cessat and deficit. Mercer in Pagnin.
therefore let me alone,] that is, give over afflicting me, and let me go
quietly to my grave, Psalm 39.13. Here one well observes, that the world and
time, while they continue, are always ceasing; and therefore have their
denomination from this word which signifies to cease.

For my days are vanity] Hebel, a puff of wind, or a bubble on the water.
Man's body is a bubble, his soul the wind that fills it. The bubble rises
higher and higher, till at last it breaks: so does the body rise from infancy
to youth, from youth to age etc. till at length it cracketh and dissolveth. The
life of man is a vain life. This Job often beats upon, and why, see the Note on
ver. 7.

Verse 17. What is man that thou should magnify him?] i. e. make so much ado
about him, or look upon him as a fit match for the great God to grapple with,
Psalm 14.3. or to take care of his affairs? Debile argumentum, says Vatablus
here, a poor argument: but Job makes use of all kind of arguments to move God
to make an end of him: Domine fac finem, fac finem, said dying Erasmus; but
what he meant by those words, I know not, says Melancthon, who reports it.

And that thou should set thine heart upon him?] So as to make any account of
so mean and miserable a creature, Psalm 144.3. to magnify him whom thou
might rather vilify, or indeed, nullify; or, that thou should set they
heart against him, sc. to destroy him, as chap. 34.14. That Is but an ignoble
contest; ubi and vincere inglorium est, and atterisordidum.

Verse 18. That thou should visit him every morning] Be at so much pains, as
it were, with him, as to chasten him: and every morning to do it, that is,
certainly and early; God took Job to task so soon as he was awake every
morning; and this he thought much of, and had rather have been without: but
that was his weakness, since the rod is as necessary as food.

And try him every moment] Proving by affliction both what corruption, and what
grace is in his heart; this David reckons upon the score of Gods favors, and
prays for, Psalm. 139. ult. This God promises as a special blessing, J^^ 9.7.
and withal assures, that he will try and ^efine his people, but not as
silver, Isa. 48.10. He will not deal with them as in rigor of justice he might
do, because if he should do so, they having more dross in them then good ore,
more corruption then grace, they would soon be consumed in this fiery trial:
this God considered, and so should Job have done, and have given over his
growling.

Verse 19. Psalm 139.10.
How long will thou not depart from me?] Here he seems desirous to be rid of
Gods company; of his afflicting presense: so true is that of the Apostle, Heb.
12.11. No chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous, till
patience come to have her perfect work; and men be brought to cry out, as one
did under a great fit of the stone, The use Lord, the use; not so much ease of
my pain, as a good use of my suffering; this Job came to at length, no doubt:
mean while, we have in him, as Mercer observes, mirum ubique specimen, a
wonderful instance of that conflict between Flesh and Spirit that is in the
Saints.

Nor let me alone, till I may swallow down my spittle] That is, not afford me
the least intermission, no not a spitting-while. He will not suffer me to take
my breath, chap 9.18. Hierome thinks that Job was troubled with a squinsey or
sore throat, which hindered the swallowing of his spittle; neither had he power
to spit out the corrupt matter that ran down his throat. Oh what a sweet mercy
is health! and how ill able are the best without special support from heaven to
bear sickness! the Stoics, who said, that he who lived honestly might live
cheerfully though under may bodily weaknesses, senserunt ipsi in morbis se
magnificentius locutos esse quam verius, says one; Wolsi^^.
that is, when it came to their own turn to be sick, they well perceived, that
they had spoken rather bravely then truly.

Verse 20. I have sinned] or, Have I sinned? Have I fallen into any foul
offense, as these men charge me? Am I guilty of any thing more then involuntary
failings, unavoidable infirmities? although I know that these also are
downright sins, fruits of the flesh properly so called, missings of the mark,
as the word here signifies, and for such I humbly confess them, I put my self
into the hands of thy justice in hope of thy mercy: and what will thou more of
thy poor creature?

What shall I do unto thee] No sooner had Job confessed his sin, but he is
desirous to know a remedy. Reprobates can cry Peccavi, I have sinned: but then
they proceed not to say as here, What shall I do? they open their wound, but
lay not on a plaster, and so the wounds made by sin are more putrified, and
grow more dangerous. Job would be directed what to do for remedy: he would have
pardoning grace and prevailing grace upon any terms: and more then this, what
can I do unto thee? as the Septuagint render this text. (...).


O thou preserver of men?] Of all men, but especially of t^em that b^lieve, 1 Timothy 4.10 The Grecians called their Jupiter (...), the Deliverer or Preserver
of their persons: and again (...) from (...) a wall, as if he were the watch
and defender of their houses. Some tender it O thou observer of men.
But these are praises proper to the true God the Keeper of his Israel, Psalm
121.4. The Preserver of the Faithful, Psalm 31.23. Whom he keeps as the apple
of his eye, Psalm 17.8. that tenderest piece of the tenderest part, most
diligently and strongly guarded by nature with ^unicles. It is the wisdom of a
Christian in his addresses into God to make choice of fit and apposite titles
and Attributes: for the strengthening of his faith, and increasing of his
fervency.

Why have thou set me as a mark against thee] As a bul-wark, as an object, or
as a rock of offense, against which thou may always dash: so Vatablus
renders it: to the same sense Job asks chap. 19.11. and 13.24. Wherefore
hold thou me for thine enemy? So Lam. 3.12. and Job 16.13. Job conceived,
that God dealt with him no otherwise then the Turks did with the great Crucifix
of Constantinople, Turk. hist. 347
upon the head whereof they put a Turks cap, and so settting it up in derision,
shot at it with their arrows, calling it the God of the Christians: Or as the
same Turks at the taking of Tripolis in Barbary, dealt with one John de Chabas
a French man, who in the time of the siege had shot off the hand of the Clark
General of the Army. Ibid. 756.
They brought him into the town, says the story, and when they had cut off his
hands and nose, they put him quick into the ground to the wast, and there for
their pleasure shot at him with their arrows, and afterward cut his throat.

So that I am a burden to my self] How can he be otherwise, who is a but-mark
for Almighty God, who cleft his very reins a sunder, and powered our his gall
upon the ground, Job 16.13. Job had once before complained, that the poison of
Gods arrows had drunk up his spirits chap. 6. Neither did any thing lie so
heavy upon him, or was so burdensome to him as this, that God seemed to frown
upon him, and to fight against him with his own hand. The Septuagint and
Talmudists read thus, So that I am a burden unto th^e, viz. with my complaints
and expostulations: this, say they, was the ancient reading.

Verse 21. And why do thou not pardon my transgression] Heb. Lift up or take
away: for sin was Job^ greatest burden, which therefore he prays to God to
pardon: and that not in heaven only, but in his own conscience: and then no
darkness can be so desolate, no cross so cutting, no burden so importable, but
he shall by Gods grace, be able to deal with it. Hence this vehement
expostulation of his for remission and removal of sin first, and then of its
evil consequents; for pardon of sin is a voluminous mercy; and being
justified by faith we can glory in tribulation Romans 5.1, 3.

For now shall I sleep in the dust] In the dust of death: Psalm. 22.15.
and therefore must have help presently, or not at all: since a man once
departed is no more to be found in this world, though never so diligently
sought for. See verse 7, 8. One paraphraseth these words thus, For now I shall
die, and then when thou look to receive thy morning sacrifice of praise as
aforetime, I shall not be found to give it thee.

CHAP. VIII. Verse 1. Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said]
BIldad (who was of the posterity of Shuah Abraham's son by Keturah, Genesis 25.1,
2.) interrupteth Job, and endeavors to maintain what Eliphaz had spoken:
Nevertheless it appears by this chapter, verse 5, 6, 20, 21. that his opinion
was not so rigid, as that of Eliphaz: for he grants that a righteous man may be
afflicted, but yet so, that if God restore him not speedily, he may be
censured, cast and condemned as unrighteous. He passes (as they do all) some
hard censures upon Job; and is paid in his own coin by him: who says, that he
was according to his name, a wicked kinsman: for (...) is naught, and (...) an
Uncle. With what judgment men judge, they shall be judged. Mat. 7 2.

Verse. 2. How long will thou speak these things?] Quonsque effaberis ista? q.
d. Tremel.
Have thou nothing better then this to utter? Be silent for shame, or forbear
at least to vent thy spleen against God, of whose proceedings with she thou
have heavily complained: thy words have been stout against the Lord, and thou
have taken too much liberty of language in this tempest of talk.

And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?] Mercer.
Big and boisterous, rude and ^robustuous, as if thou would Dominum impetere,
evertere, and dejicere blow down God and his proceedings at a breath. The
Tigurine translation is, Quanaiu verba oris ^ui so^abu^t pertinacia^? How long
shall the words of thy mouth sound out thine obstinacy? If evil thoughts be
majoris reatus, of greater guilt, as the Schools speak; yet evil words and
works are majoris infamia, of greater scandal, and do more corrupt others. This
Bildad was sensible of, and conceiving that Job complained of God as dealing
hardly with him, and unjustly afflicting him: he adds,

Verse 3. Does God pervert judgment?] By not punishing the wicked: or does the
Almighty pervert justice? by not rewarding the righteous (so the Hebrews
expound it) Why no: neither did Job ever say such a thing; only he had
pathetically set forth the greatness of his pain, and the unkindness of his
friends, and wished to die rather then to endure it. Now this was construed for
blasphemy, or little less: and Bildad is very hot in his invective against Job,
as good reason he had, if he had not been so mistaken. Here he wresteth in a
most true proposition (commondam sane sed non acc^mmodam) but yet such a one as
very little concerned this present disputation: and he does it with as small
wisdom and discretion, says Beza, as with great pride and confidence. For
does it either argue Job and hypocrite, and wicked man, or charge God with
injustice if it be said, that Job for his sins was not so afflicted by God
(whereas he in the mean time denies not himself to be a sinner, and to have
deserved Gods heavy hand upon him) but rather proved and tried by him according
to his good pleasure? yet Bildad goes on as if he had done very well: and in
the next verse in plain words boldly avoucheth that Jobs children were by Gods
judgment destroyed with the fall of the house, whatever betid their souls.

Verse. 4. If thy children have sinned against him] As what man is he that
lives and sins not? But Bildad meant that Jobs children had hainously
sinned, had been grievous sinners against their own souls (as afterward were
Core and his accomplices) had not sinned common sins, and therefore died not
common deaths: indeed they died early and suddenly, and eating and drinking
(wherein there might be some excess) and before sacrifice offered for them, as
formerly: all this was sad, and moved Job more then any thing else. But did it
therefore follow that God have cast them away? etc.

And he have cast them away for their transgression] Or, And he have expelled
or abandoned them into the hand (so the Hebrew has it elegantly) of their
transgressions or rebellions, Pagnin.
as so may executioners. Some render it thus, He has driven them out of the
world for their transgression. The Chaldee Paraphrast goes further,
interpreting hand here for place. If God have sent them, says he, into the
place of their wickedness, that is, into hell prepared for the wicked. Now
surely, says Lavater, Inhumanissimus fuit Bildad, qui ista calamitosissimo
objicere non dubitabat: Bildad was a most unmerciful man, who doubted not to
lay these things in the dish of him that was before so heavily afflicted, and
to heap more load upon him who was ready to sink under his burden: but he did
it, say some, of a good intent, to bring Job to a sense of his sin, and to put
him in hope of appeasing Gods wrath, who had yet spared his life that he might
make his peace, and not suddenly slay him as he had done them: and therefore he
assures him in the following verses, as Eliphaz had done before, that all
things shall go well with him if he repent. Albeit thy children have sinned,
etc. yet

Verse 5. If thou would seek unto God betimes] If warned by the evil end that
befell thine unhappy children, thou would early and earnestly seek unto God
for mercy, for which purpose it may seem that thy life has been graciously
spared, when thy children have been destroyed, that thou might be made wise
at their expense. Such counsel as this is, Eliphaz had given Job before, chap.
5.8.

And make thy supplication to the Almighty] Pray for mercy out of free grace
alone, so the Hebrew word signifies: plead for pity, speak supplications as
the poor man does, Prove 18.23. Be poor in spirit, a stark beggar and bankrupt,
less then the least of all Gods mercies, Genesis 32.10. and in this mind address
thy self to the All-sufficient, the Cornucopia, the God rich in mercy to all
that call upon him, for pardon of thy great sin in standing out in contention
with his Majesty, and resisting his fatherly visitation.

Verse 6. If thou were pure and upright] If thou did lift up pure hands to
God in prayer, (...). Hom.
etc.

Pura Deus meant est, pura vu^t mente vocari:
Et puras, jussit p^^dus haber^, preces.
The fountain of goodness will not be laden at with foul hearts and hands, Jer
4.14. Jam. 4.8. Isai. 1.15, 16. Joh. 9.31. 1 Timothy 2.8. (...), an heathen
Philosopher, being at sea in a great storm, and perceiving many wicked wretches
with him in the ship calling upon the gods, Silete, inquit, ne Dii vos hic
navigare sent^ant, Hold your tongues, said he, pray not, lest the gods take
notice that you are here, and we all perish for your sakes. There are that take
these words for Reformation, as the former verse for Humiliation, those two
parts of true repentance: if thou were pure and upright, as a right
penitentiary would be; if thou would break off thy sins by repentance, and
especially thine hypocrisy which has brought this punishment upon thee from
the Lord. If thou would not only repent for thy sins, but also from thy sins,
and frame to lead a new life, which is, Optima and aptissima poenitentia, says
Luther, the best and soundest repentance.

Surely now he would awake for thee] Thou should undoubtedly find speedy and
unmiscarrying returns of thy prayers, and all good acceptance of thy services:
he will hear thee for deliverance, so the Septuagint render it: he will up and
do it, he will arise and have mercy upon Zion (Psalm 102.13.) for now that she
prays and purges her self from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, the time
to favor her, yea, the set time is come. I am come for thy words, says the
Angel to Daniel, chap. 10.12.

And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous] i. e. He will bless
thy well ordered family, and whatsoever thou do therein shall prosper, Psalm
1.3. Thy children and servants shall live together in peace, and all good
agreement: thy stock also, and thy store shall be increased. He shall restore
it to, or repair it for thee. as the Septuagint here render it: peace, plenty
and prosperity shall be heaped upon thee; (...). Sept.
this is the import of the word (...). Some of the Hebrews by habitation of
righteousness, here understand the soul, in which dwells righteousness.
Others of them take it for the body, the habitation of the soul, wherein
righteousness is seated. But these senses are far fetched.

Verse 7. Though thy beginning was small, yet thy later end should greatly
increase] Thy late losses God will recompense with interest: and the felicity
which the prepares for thee shall be far greater then that, the loss whereof
thou do now regret; for he will enrich thee to admiration, thy later end
shall be ineffable (so the Septuagint have it) such as none shall be able to
utter or describe. See chap. 40.10, 12. (...)
The day of small things is not to be despised, Zech. 4.10. Every former mercy
is a pledge of a future; and to him that has shall be given. God delights to
help his people with a little help at first, to crumble his mercies to us, as
one phraseth it: to give us his blessings by retail, to maintain trading and
communion between him and us. So the cloud emptieth not is self at a sudden
burst, but dissolveth upon the earth drop after drop.

Verse 8. For enquire, I pray thee] Bildad speaks fair, as Eliphaz had done,
whom he all along imitateth.

Above majori discit arare minor. Of the former age] The generations
afore-going* the Kadmonim, as the Jews called their Ancestors, and used this
saying concerning them, Cor priscorum fuit sicus porta etc. the heart of our
progenitors was as the gate of the porch of the Temple, Rara datur longo
prudentia temporis usu. Talmud. (...) Rheto. lib. 1. (...) Seris venit usus ab
annis. (...) Diod. Sic.
ample and beautiful: but the heart of their posterity, is as the eye of a
needle, narrow and of no receipt in comparison. Of witnesses Aristotle
witnesses, that the more ancient they are, the more creditable, because less
corrupt. Nihil mihi antiquius, say the Latins; Nothing is more ancient to me,
that is, more highly reputed. And New things are nothing, say the Greeks.
Siculus makes mention of an Egyptian Priest, who said to Solon one of the
Greek Sages, you Grecians are very boys (ye are but of yesterday, as it is in
the next verse) neither is there an old man (that is, a man versed in ancient
histories, or acquainted with antiquities) to be found amongst you all. Much of
the ancient Divinity was traditional, till Moses set pen to paper: the mind of
God was either immediately revealed, or handed down and transmitted from father
to son, from generation to generation. Hence Bildad here bids Job enquire of
the former ages: and thereto refers him for further information: so does Moses
the Israelites, Deuteronomy. 4.20. and 32.7. Antiquity, so it be right, is of no small
authority: that is a received rule, Quod antiquissimum verissimum, that is
truest which is ancientest: as we prefer the newest Philosophy, so the
ancientest Divinity. The Papists boast much of Antiquity (as the Gibeonites did
of old shoes and moldy bread): but when they come to prove it; they go no
higher then to about a thousand years ago. They scornfully look upon us as
Novellers, and ask where our religion was before Luther? We answer them, that
our religion was always in the bible* where their religion never was. This is
the old commandment, says St. John, which was from the beginning, 1 John 2.7

An^ prepare thy self to the search of their fathers] Or fit thy self, fix thy
mind upon it, as Psam 100.1. We must not think to find truth, but upon a
serious search, Prove. 2.3. Anaxagoras complained omnia esse ci^ cumfusa
tenebris, that all things were full of darkness. Empedocles, that the inlets
of the senses were very narrow. Democritus, that Truth lay hid as it were in a
deep pit that could hardly be fathomed. St. Paul cries out, O the depth! How
unsearchable are Gods judgments, and his ways past finding out! Prepare
therefore to this search after God; and pray as that, poor man did that cried
after Christ; and when he was asked what would thou have? Lord, said he, that
mine eyes might be opened.

Verse 9. For we are but of yesterday] Heb. We are yesterday, that is,
yesterdays offspring, upstarts, mushrooms, novices, of very small standing in
the would. And yet they were old men, chap. 15.10. Eliphaz is esteemed to be an
hundred and fifty; Bildad and hundred and forty; Zophar an hundred and twenty
years old; and yet, in comparison of he fathers before the flood, they were but
of yesterday, they had lived but a very little while, and were but of late time.

And know nothing] Neque experti sumus, says Tremellius: the greatest part of
our knowledge is but the least part of our ignorance: how can we know much, when
our abode here is so short, our experience so little? Ars long, vita brevis,
said Hippocrates, life is short, and art is long. Themistocles though he lived
an hundred and seven years; yet at his death complained, saying, Now I am to
die when I begin to be wise. Solon said, that though old, yet he thought not
himself too old to learn: and Julian the Lawyer was wont to say, that when he
had one foot in the grave, yet he would have the other in the School.

Because our days upon earth are a shadow] Fluxa, instabilis, and ipsa ultro
abiens, says Junius, unsubstantial, unsettled, uncertain, there is no hold nor
tack in it, Psalm 102.11. 1 Chronicles. 29.15. What is man but a dream of a shadow,
says Pindarus, (...). Tsillah. umbra ipsius. ^
a shadow of smoke, says Sophocles; a shadow of a shadow, says Aeschylus. He
is therefore not a man, but a shadow of man (as Lamechs second wives name was
Zillah a shadow of a wife; and as Menander calls a false friend (...), the
shadow of a friend) he has not so much as shadow of reason or true
understanding, who by spending the span, by wasting the shadow of this short
life, after the ways of his own heart, bereaveth himself of a room in that
city of pearls, and loses the comforts of that life which lasts for ever.

Verse 10. Shall they not teach thee, and tell thee] They, that is, the
forefathers, verse 8. these, though dead and gone, yet by their records and
monuments, by their Apopthegmes and Oracles (for the words of dying men are
living oracles) do still teach us and tell us their minds, as if they were yet
living, Heb. 11.4. Luke 16.29. Books are mute, matters, silent voices. The way
to be wise, said an Heathen, is to converse with the dead. (...).
Histories are faithful Counselors, and by the reading of them, many young men
have attained to more understanding then their elders; as Augustus, Theodosius,
Maca^ius, who was surnamed (...), the oldyouth, for his wisdom and gravity
above his years gotten by reading and prayer, as says Nicephorus.

And utter words out of their hearts] Discourses dug out of their own
hearts, things new and old, e cordibus, non e codicibus.
thrown out of that good treasure: they were egregie cordati homines,
hearty-good men, and their speeches were heart-sprung, dipped in their hearts,
and there recalled ad limam, priusquam ad ling^am, weighed before uttered. They
spoke not as thou do Job, rashly and at random; but judiciously, solidly,
oraculously: consult them therefore, and as they speak from their own heart,
so let them speak to thine. With the ancient is wisdom, and in length of days
understanding, chap. 12.12.

Verse 11. Can the rush grow up without mire?] Jam subjungit quod illi
exploratum habuerant and perspectum, sed eleganti similitudine, says Mercer:
That is, here Bildad sets forth what the fathers had observed, taught, and
told them: and this he does by three elegant similitudes, which was a way of
teaching usual among the ancients, ut quod per simplex praeceptum teneri non
possit, per similitudines teneretur, Hieron. in cap. 19. Matthew.
that that which could not be remembered by simple precepts, might be retained
by similitudes drawn from natural things, which are as shadows to us of
spiritual. And first from the rush, which has its name from drinking; because
it lives in liquor, it loves and delights in a moorish soil. Can the rush (or
bul-rush, Exodus 2.3. Isai. 18.2.) grow up? Heb. peirk and pride it self, bear
the head aloft, shoot up amain, without mire or moisture, such as are the
fennes, chap. 40.21.? The meaning hereof is, says Ferus, Look how the rush and
flag grow not but in miry places; remove them to dry and firm ground, and they
soon wither: So the wicked hypocrite in prosperity makes a great show of
piety; but in adversity he loses that very show, and by his impatiency makes
the hollownesse of his heart appear to all men: and herein Bildad aimed at the
making of Jobs case odious, whom he now held for an hypocrite.

Can the flag] Or grass of the meadow? Genesis 41.2. it has its name from
brotherhood, because many piles of grass or sedg, grow from one and the same
root, Sic mala quaedam olitores Germanitatis vocant.
but not without water. See 1 Kings 18.5.

Verse 12. Whilst it is yet in his greenness etc.] And so withers not
through age, as being but in its shooting up.

And not cut downe] Or, cropped off, either by the hands of men, or teeth of
beasts.

It withereth] for want of water, without store whereof it cannot live. The
Hypocrite is a sensuallist, Judge. 18.19. Job 21.11. Hos. 4.11. he lives in
such miry places, as cannot be healed by the waters of the Sanctuary, Ezekiel.
47.11. He says, as the Vine and the Olive in Jothams parable, I cannot leave
my wine, my fat and sweet sins; take away my liquor, you take away my life: He
serves not the Lord Jesus Christ (whatever he pretends) but his own belly,
Romans 16. He follows Christ for the loaves only.

Before any other herb] That is, of less show, but better rooting: these
retain their verdure, and look on, as it were, to see the rush wither; so David
did by Doeg, Psalm 52.5, 6, 8.

Ver. 13. So are the paths of all that forget God] To remember God is as
necessary as to draw breath, says Chrysostom. This the wicked man does not,
Psalm 9.17. He will neither have God in his head, Psalm 10.4. nor heart, Psalm
14.1. nor words, Psalm 12.2. nor ways, Tit. 1.16. What wonder then though his
paths wither, though his life, health, wealth, power, perish, since he is in
such a posture of distance from, and defiance with the fountain of living
waters, the Father of all mercy and consolation; by whose favor such flourish
for a time sed exoriuntur, ut exurantur?

And the hypocrites hope shall perish] Every wicked man is an hypocrite; and if
there were nothing else to evince it, yet his very hope and groundless
confidence in the mercies of God without warrant of a promise, would
undoubtedly prove it. Praesumendo sperai, and sperando perit, says an Ancient;
he presumptuously hops, and by hoping perishes; he lays his own shadow for
a bridge, and so must need fall into the brook: Trust thou in the Lord and do
good, says David, Psalm 37.3. But this man, though he cannot tell of one tear
for sin, nor one hour spent in the practice of mortification; yet he affirms
deeply of going to heaven, and is ready to rap, yea bounce at heaver-gate with
Lord, Lord, open unto us: Psalm. 125.5.
But what says the Psalmist? As for such as turn aside unto their crooked
ways (though they do it never so slily, as if they would steal a passage to
hell, and the world never the wiser) the Lord shall lead them forth with the
workers of iniquity, with gross offenders as malefactors are led forth to
execution: and when the filthy sinner (so the word here rendered hypocrite
signifies) goes damned to hell; what shall become of the zealous professor,
with all his fall hopes and possibilities? Surely God rejects their
confidences; they shall not prosper in them, Jer. 2.37.

Verse 14. Whose hope (or whose folly, that is, whose foolish hope) shall be
cut off] The Latin translation has it, his folly shall not please him, sc.
when once he sees by the disappointment of his high hopes, what a fools
paradise he had wrought himself into, what pains he has taken to go to hell,
his hope shall be cut off: and that is the greatest cut in the world.
Hypocritis nihil stupidius.
This, Bildad tells the hypocrite twice over: because he will hardly be drawn
to believe it. But that he tells Job so, as if he were this hopeless
hypocrite, he is quite beside the cushion, as we say.

And whose trust shall be a spiders web] Wherein there is much artifice, but no
strength. Trust is somewhat more then hope: it is a bearing a man's self bold
upon assurance that all shall be well: such was that of Babylon in their
provision, laid in to ^old out a siege of 20 years lasting. such also is that
of mystical Babylon, who says, I shall see no sorrow, Isa. 59.5.
Rev. 18.6. But this trust never triumphs. It is (by a second) comparison)
here fitly set forth by a spiders web, Heb. a spiders house; so called because
therein the spider lodges her self, as if safe, and out of harms way, which is
nothing so. A Reverend man clears the comparison thus; First, the spiders web
is made out of her own bowels, (her motto was mihi solidebe^) so is the
hypocrites hope merely from his own brain and imagination. Secondly, though
this web be curiously framed, yet it only catches flies: so do hypocrites look
after ceremonies, and not substance. Thirdly, the spider is full of poison, and
remains in a dusty nasty hole, though she work never so curiously: so does
the hypocrite abide in his unregeneracy etc. Fourthly, she gets to the top of
the window, as high as she can: and then when she falls, she falls to the
bottom, for nothing stays her: so here. Fifthly, when the besome comes, she
and her web are swept away, and she is trodden under foot: so are all
presumptuous hypocrites. Beckets friends advised him (for his security) to have
a Mass in honor of Saint Steven, to keep him from the hands of his enemies:
he did so, but it saved him not. Contrarily, a poor persecuted Hugonot in the
Massacre at Paris had crept into a hole, a spider comes and weaves a cobweb
over it. The murderers therefore presumed him not there; and so he was
preserved. What cannot the Lord do by the weakest means that may be?

Verse 15. He shall lean upon his house] The spider shall; so Vatablus takes
it: but better, the hypocrite leans, or lays his whole weight upon his
house, that is, wealth, children, friends, clients, tenants etc. as did Doeg,
P^al. 52.7. Haman, Esth. 4.11. That profane Earl of Westmorland, who said, that
he needed not at all to pray to God; for he had tenants enough to pray for him.
Bildad probably glanceth here at Job, as if he had once trusted in his riches,
relations etc. which yet Job disavoweth, chap. 31.

But it shall not stand] No more then the spiders house does, born down
sometimes by her very weight, and not only by the wind. Hypocrites ruin their
own houses by their sins, and particularly by relying on them. Though thou
build thy palace as high as heaven, said the Oracle to Phocas, yet sin that
lies at the bottom will be the ruin of it.

He shall hold it fast] Mordicus tenebit, he shall hold it, not with his hands
only, but with his teeth also, as Cynegiras did the Persian ship, or as a
drowning man does the branch of a tree.

But it shall noe endure] All will not do; riches avail not in the day of wrath
etc. An hypocrite runs in his trouble to former false refuges; he trusted to
his legs, or repairs to his bushes, as the hunted hare does to the places that
she used when she lived at quiet, thither she flies when she knows not how else
to escape; but all to no purpose.

Verse 16. He is green before the Sun] Succosus est, says Tremellius, he is
sappy and juicy, having a confluence of all kind of comforts and contentments,
even more then heart could wish, as David expres^^th it, Psalm. 73.7. The
hypocrite is all this; the height of whose happiness is here set forth by a
third similitude, lest any should think that the two former did not reach home
to the thing intended. Look how, says Bildad, a great and tall tree, having
many roots and branches, may be so cut up and thrown down, that no foot-step,
or sign of it may any more appear: So may it fare with a wicked man, though he
be as a tree green or juiceful before the Sun, or when the Sun shines hottest
upon him: the rush may then wither, but not the tree. See Psalm 37.35. Any
hypocrite may abound exceedingly in outward prosperity; yea he may be green for
a while before the Sun of persecution, as was Alexa^d^^ the Coppersmith, Acts
19.32. with 2 Timothy 4.14. The thorny ground stood out the heat of the Sunbeams,
and shrank not in the wetting etc.

And his branch shoots forth in his garden] Mr. Broughton translates, His
suckers sprout out over his orchyard, that is, he grows luxuriously eminent in
the place where he lives, which he has made to become a kind of a paradise,
or garden of delight. By garden here we are to understand, says Mercer, all
those ways and means whereby a wicked man fenceth and increases his own
greatness. Some of the Jew-Doctors, and others also after them, think that
Bildad here begins to speak of the godly man's happiness; and they read the
text thus, But the perfect man (so they supply the text out of verse 20.) is
green before the Sun, and his branches etc. His roots are wraped near the
fountain, and he windeth himself about the stony building; (that is, it
spreads and twisteth its boughs round about the fountain-vault, being
strongly built with stone) shall he be taken out of his place, which may deny,
saying, I have not seen thee? No, that cannot be. Lo this shall be that joy of
his way, even out of his mould shall others grow, i. e. his very dust shall
live and grow up after him. Thus Beza, and after him Diodate: He is like an
exquisite tree set in a pleasant garden in sight of his masters palace, sucking
the sweet moistness of the quick-springs, without ever fading or withering,
psalm 1.3. Jer. 17.8. That is to say, he shall have a lively root of faith,
continually nourished by Gods grace; under his safeguard and favor he shall
be strong in all assayes, abundant in good works, and all manner of blessings.
Vterque sensus egregius est, says Mercer; this also is a good sense, but the
former I conceive to be the better, and more agreeable to the letter of the
text.

Verse 17. His roots are wrapped about the heap etc.] i. e. they are deeply
entrenched, and strongly incorporated into the ground, wreathed in with the
heap, as thorns about a hedge. The hypocrite seems to be notably well rooted,
not in the world only, but in the Church too, which we may compare (as Plato
does man, Intricantu^.
whom he calls (...), an heavenly plant) to a tree inverted, with the root
above, and the branches below. Our Savior speaks of branches in him
(seemingly so) that bear not fruit, John 15.2. These are hypocrites, who think
themselves to be rooted in Christ, and others also think no less of them, but
it proves otherwise, for they are fruitless; as a poll fixed in the earth, but
not rooted there, as a rotten leg cleaves to the body, but is no part of it; or
as wens and ulcers which are taken away without any loss to it. How far an
hypocrite may go, see the parable of the stony and thorny grounds, Matthew. 13.
See also Heb. 6.4, 5. and 16.29 2 Pet. 2.20, 21. He may come as far as
Kadesh-barnea, within eleven days journey of the heavenly Canaan, and yet fall
short of it: he may seem to be steadfast and unmovable, as a tree whose roots
are wrapped about a rock.

He sees the place of stones] Mr. Brougthton renders it, He platteth about
the house of stone: Others, He looks into the house of stone; he looks in at
the windows, and so hinders the light, annoying the masters house both below
and above, who therefore resolves to have him down: as it follows.

Verse 18. If he destroy him from his place] If he stub up this green tree, no
better surely then the Cyparit, of which Pliny writes that it bears fruit to
no purpose, Plin. lib. 10.
small berries, bitter leaves, that it yields an ill smell, and no pleasant
shade: or as the box-tree, green indeed all the year about, but of an offensive
smell, no fruit, and such a seed as all living creatures hate. Now if he, that
is, Almighty God, destroy him, that is, the hypocrite, as he will do
questionless (totally and speedily swallowing him up) what then?

Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee] Heb. It shall tell a lie
of him etc. the place as ashamed to own him, shall feign and say, We have not
seen him, we know not what is become of him. So Psalm 37.35, 26. As they have
denied the Lord that bought them, 2 Pet. 2.1. So they shall one day be denied
by the places they have bought or builded, by the people that once clawed them,
and cried them up.

Verse 19. Behold, this is the joy of his way] q.d. A goodly joy! sure the
hypocrites joy is but the hypocrisy of joy, a little counterfeit complexion,
like a slight dash of rain, a handful of brush wood, or sear thorn under the
pot, Eccles. 7.6. or as weeds that grow on the top of the water, floating
aloft, but touch not the bottom. Vt canes solent quando peregre adveaienti
Domino adulantur.
Though it be an exulting joy, (as the word signifies) a leaping joy (such as
is that of dogs leaping upon their masters returning home after a journey) yet
it is not lasting; it goes out as snuff, or as a blazing star, or at best as
the fire of thorns, Psalm 118.12. Naz.
Yea, though for the time it has been so great, that if it had continued but a
while, it would have overwhelmed them, so that their spirits would have
expired, as some Apostates have professed; they have thought themselves in
heaven sometimes, and have rejoiced accordingly. (...).

And out of the earth shall others grow] Alii qui alieni erunt ab eo. Others
who had no relation to him shall succeed him, Drus.
enjoy his estate, and eat the sweet of all his labors, chap. 27.16, 17.
Eccles. 2.18. and 4.8. Prove. 12.3. A man shall not be established by
wickedness; but the root of the righteous shall not be moved. See another
sense of this, and the three foregoing verses, verse 16.

Verse 20. Behold God will not cast away a perfect man] Epilogus sermonis
Bildad: This is the Epilogue or close of Bildads speech to Job; and it has
been the tartness of a threatening mixed with the sweetness of the promise:
sour and sweet, we say, make the best sauce. The strong God will not use, or
rather, abuse his power, to the rejecting or reprobating (as the Septuagint
render it) of an upright person: but will help him by taking him by the hand,
as it follows in the next clause, and taking it ill if others do not so too,
Mercer.
Isa 51.18. He will never leave them (or if sometimes he seem to leave them,
yet) he will not forsake them, Heb. 13.5. forsake them he may, in regard of
vision, but not of union; desert them for a time (as he did Christ himself) but
not dis-inherite them. When they be in the land of their enemies (and so may
seem quite cast away) I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them to
destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them, for I am the Lord
their God, Lev. 26.44. Lo this is the portion of a perfect man. As for
hypocrites (who are semiperfectae virtutis homines, as Philo calls them,
cakes half-baked, Hos. 7.8. Christians almost, but not altogether, Acts 26.29.)
My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him, Hos 9.15.

Neither will he help the evil doers] Heb. He will not lay hold upon the hand,
viz. to help them; or he will not take by the hand the evildoers that make a
trade of sin; Non porriget manum malignis. Vulg.
he will have no communion or commerce with such, he will not strike hands, or
join hands with them, but wash his hands of them for ever, shake them off with
a Discedite, Depart ye, be packing: so should we. See D^vids both practice
Psalm. 26.4, 5 and prayer, verse 9. Gather not my soul with sinners etc. It was
once the prayer of a good Gentlewoman, when she was to die, being in much
trouble of conscience, O Lord, let me not go to hell where the wicked are; for,
Lord, thou know I never loved their company here.

Verse 21. Till he fill thy mouth with laughing etc.] Here he applies the
promise of the divine help to Job, and that which is here spoken, debent and
reliqu^ fideles ad se transfer, says Lavater, every true believer must take
home to himself: God will turn all their sadness into gladness, all their
sighing into singing, all their tears into triumphs, their sorrowful outcries
into joyful jubilees. In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare or a
cord, viz. to strangle his joy with, to check and choke all his comforts; but
the righteous sing and rejoice Prove. 29.6. They may do so here amidst all their
troubles, 2 Cor. 7.4. As the Lily looks fresh and beautiful, and blithe, though
among thorns: they shall do so hereafter, when they enter into the joy of their
master. See Isa. 65.13. A joy fitter to be believed, then possible to be
discoursed. See a shadow of it, Psalm 126.1, 2.

Verse 22. They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame] It shall cover
their faces, Psalm 69.7. yea, over-cover the whole man; when beyond all
expectation they shall see thee restored to thy former prosperity. Where it is
worth considering, says one, how truly this fell out touching Job, and these
his friends; he was restored, and they by Gods reproving them, covered with
shame, as it appears chap. 42.

And the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought] Heb. shall not be.
See ver 18. Understand it not of his tabernacle only, or dewlling place, but of
his whole estate, both temporal and spiritual, all shall come to wrack and
ruin. God shall utterly overturn them, as Z^sca did those three hundred
Monasteries, and among the rest that famous Monastery called, the Kings Court,
a mile from Prague: in the walls whereof, Mr. Clark in his life.
the whole Bible was most exquisitely written in letters of gold. The house of
the wicked shall be overthrown, but the tabernacle of the upright shall
flourish, Prove. 14.11.

CHAP. IX. Verse 1. Then Job answered and said]
HE answered to his two friends who had formerly spoken: first, to that of
Eliphaz, chap. 4.17. and next to that of Bildad, chap. 8.3. Bildad had
interrupted him when he would have excused himself, that he did by no means
deny the justice of God, as they mistook him. Now therefore, that Bildad had
spoke his utmost, Job begins to dispute and to declare his judgment
concerning that subject: and this he does long magnificentius and augustius
quam socii, says Mercer, far more magnificently and majestically then his two
friends had done; proving that God is just, even then when he afflicts the
innocent: neither have such any just cause to except against his proceedings in
that behalf, since he fetches not the causes of his decrees and purposes from
the things which he governs; but his will, which is before all things, is the
rule of all justice. St. Paul also had respect unto this, Romans 9.20. and 11.32.
rising a great deal higher, namely, to the eternal decree of Election and
Reprobation: after this, Job sets forth what is the condition of men, and
what poor things they are in comparison of God, thereby to bring himself and
others to the true knowledge of God, and of themselves, which is the highest
wisdom in the world.

Verse 2. I know it is so of a truth] Bildads argument was, God who has
punished thee is just, therefore thou art unjust. Job grants the Antecedent
here, but denies and refutes the consequent, verse 22, 23. etc. To Eliphaz also
Job grants, not only that man could not be more just then God, as he had said,
chap. 4.3. but also that none could ever be found so just, that he might any
way be compared to God: Job is one of those Candidates of Immortality, who can
do nothing against the truth; but for the truth, 2 Cor. 13.8. every parcel
whereof he accounted precious, and could not but be a friend to it, though
brought by them who seemed his enemies; this spoke him ingenuous and humble, a
well-tempered champion for the truth: Athanasius is said to be such another,
and so Mr. Bucer. Helvidius is taxed by Hierome, for the contrary, and B.
Mountague, by D. Rivet.

But how should man be just with God?] Mr. Broughton translateth, And how can
man be just before the Omnipotent? Sorry, sickly, wretched man, how can he be
just ( sc. by an inherent righteousness; by an imputed he may) before the most
Holy and Almighty God; or compared to him? Job afterward setting himself by
God, and considering the infinite distance and disproportion, cries out, I
abhor my self; and repent in dust and ashes, chap. 42.5, 6. I say likewise, Woe
is me, for I am undone, chap. 6.5. He that has looked a while intentively upon
the body of the Sun, is so dazeled with the beams thereof, that he can see
nothing.

Verse 3. If he will contend with him] If any one would be so foolhardy, or
adventurous, as to dispute with God about his judgments, he could not, though
he were never so wise, or well-skilled, answer him one objection of a
thousand, but must needs yield any say, I am no fit match for God. The
Jew-Doctors (and after them Vatablus) set this sense upon the text, If he (that
is, if man) should contend with him, (that is, with God, as through the
Luciferian pride of his heart, he is apt enough to do) he would not answer him
one of a thousand: God would not honor him so far as to answer so contemptible
an adversary, and so slight and senseless arguments; if he vouchsafe an
answer, it shall not be so much as the Echo gives the voice: it shall not be
to one article or argument of a thousand. Egregius quidem sensus, says Mercer:
this is a good sense, but the other is better, and well agrees with verse 14.

Verse 4. He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength] And must therefore needs
be a most just judge, since he neither wants wisdom to judge, nor power to
execute: what then should turn him out of the track of Justice? Let God be just
and true; but every man a liar: as it is written, That thou might be
justified in thy sayings, Psalm 55.4. Romans 3.4.
and might overcome (or be clear) when thou judge, or when thou art
judged: for at the same time that God does judge, or execute judgment upon any,
he may also be said to be judged: whilst men pass their censures, either as
applauding or disliking his judgments: and then may he be said to overcome,
when judged, when men acknowledge the justice of his judgments; when they
conclude him wise in heart, that is, the only wise God, 1 Timothy 1.17. and mighty
in strength, that is, the mighty strong God, Isai. 9.6. Who does whatsoever he
will in heaven and earth, Psalm 1 ^8. In speaking of these and other his most
glorious attributes, we speak non quantum debemus, sed quentum possumus, not so
much as we ought, but so much as we are able. As for the wisdom of God, Nemo
sapientiam Dei immensam in omnem aeternitatem exhauriet, (says Gra^ian the
Emperor in an Epistle to Ambrose) no man shall ever be able to fathom or find
it out. And as for his power, so infinite, is the distance betwixt God, and the
greatest Noble, that it is an honor that they may be suffered to live in his
sight, Exodus 24.10, 11. And it is all one with God whether against a man, or a
nation, Job 34.29.

Who has hardened himself against him, and has prospered?] Instance but any
one, whether tongue-smitter, or hand-smiter, that could ever boast of the last
blow, or could cry, Victoria; Quis dura locutus est ^i? so some render it. Who
ever uttered hard speeches ( Jude 15) stout words, Mal. 3.13. against God, and
prospered, escaped scot-free, as we say, and had not his full payment?
Blasphemers set their mouths against heaven, witness Pharaoh, Sennacherib,
Julian, etc. dealing with Almighty God, (...). Lonicer. theat. histor.
as if Augustus Caesar were dealing with some god Neptune; Caligula with his
Jupiter, whom he dared to a duel: or the three sons trying their archery at
their fathers heart, to see who can shoot nighest. But shall they thus escape
by iniquity? No; In thine anger cast down the people, O God. Psalm 56.7. The
wall of Aphek did execution upon the blasphemous Syrians; the Angel of God upon
the Assyrians: his visible vengeance fell upon Julian, Arius. and Olympius an
Arian bishop, who denying the Trinity, was struck with three thunderbolts, and
killed in a bath. Others understand here the word Libbo, and read it thus, who
has hardened his heart against him? etc. Surely if men harden their hearts,
God will harden his hand, and hasten their destruction. See Prove. 29.1. Isai.
6.10, 11. Romans 2, 5. and get thy flinty heart made fleshy, since an hard heart
is in some respect worse then hell (which is the just hire of it) since one of
the greatest sins is far greater in evil, then any of the greatest punishments.

Verse 5. Which removes the mountains, and they know not] For further proof of
Gods power first (and then afterward of his wisdom). Job produces diverse
particular acts of his upon the creatures, both unreasonable and reasonable.
El^phaz had said somewhat to this purpose chap. 4. se hic admirandus est Job,
says Merceri, Job does it admirably: his tongue like a silver trumpet, sets
forth the high praises of God far more plainly, plentifully and magnificently
then any of his friends, who yet have done it very well too. God to show his
power, removes the mountains, says Job, sc. by stupendous earthquakes, and
otherwise, at his pleasure, Nahum 1.5. Psalm 97.4, 5. Isa. 40.15. he takes up
the Isles as a very little thing; he can remove mountains with a wet finger, as
we say, though so mighty in bulk, and strongly founded. Dionysius thinks,
that in thus speaking, Job aims at that which was done in the time of Noah's
flood, when the waters with their mighty force, galled and bare down many great
mountains, but that is uncertain. Great things God will do by the fire of the
last day, when mountains shall melt, rocks rent, and the earth with the works
therein, shall be all burnt up, 2 Pet. 2.10. And what desolations he has made
in sundry parts of the earth by terrible earthquakes, as at Antioch often
(which was there-hence called (...), because so visited by God) in diverse
places of Italy, Sicily, Burgundy, Helvetia, Joseph. Cedren. Plin l. 2. cap.
83. Camb Lritan.
and here in Hereford-shire, mention is made in Pliny, Stumpsius, Jovius, and
other historians, all making good this of Job, and that of the Psalmist, The
mountains will skip like rams, and the little hills like lambs, when the Lord
is displeased, Psalm 114.4.

And they know it not] Dicto citius, it is done with a trice, speedily and
secretly, before the mountains (if they could at all know) could know what is
done to them* or before the mountaineers or the neighborhood could foresee and
avoid the danger of being overwhelmed and buried alive.

Which overturneth them in his anger] Or, that he overturneth them in his
anger. Men are not sensible of Gods anger for sin, no not in the greatest
commotions, such is their stupidity; but will needs swelter and pine away in
their iniquities, as if nothing could awake them, Lev. 26 39.

Verse 6. Which shakes the earth out of her place] By mighty earthquakes,
dislocating the earth; some part of it; for the whole was never removed, though
God can take up the whole Globe as a man would do a hall, tossing the very
center it self whereon it is established, 2 Samuel 22.8. etc. There is a twofold
power of God, 1. Absolute. 2. Actual. By the former he can do more then he
does: By the latter, whatsoever he wills, that without impediment he
effects. As for the earth, as God upholdeth it by the word of his power, Heb.
1.3. so he has poised it me^^ly by its own weight, that it should not be
removed for ever, Psalm 104.5. For if you imagine that the earth could be
removed out of its natural place, which way so ever it be removed, it shall
move toward heaven, and so shall naturally ascend: but to do so is utterly
repugnant to the nature of the earth, which is, to bear downward. All which
notwithstanding, the God of nature, as he is in the heaven, so he does
whatsoever he will in heaven and earth.

Verse 7. Which commands the Sun, and it rises not] God in framing the
world, began above, and wrought downward: but Job in describing the great works
of God here, began below: and now goes upward from earth to heaven. It is as
natural to the heaven to move, as to the earth to stand still. Copernicus his
opinion, that the earth turns round, and heaven stands still, is worthily
exploded: round the earth is indeed, notwithstanding the hills and valleys (as
an apple is round, notwithstanding some knots and bunches in it:) and being
round, it is naturally apt for motion (the Pythagoreans held, that the earth
was natura sua mobilis, as the heavens are) but God has fixed and made it
unmovable, whiles the heavenly bodies are restless in their courses. The Sun
(the glistering Sun, as the word here signifies) rejoices as a strong man to
run his race, Psalm 19.5. De ascens^nent. in Deum. grad. 7
Bellarmine says, that in the eighth part of an hour the Sun runs 700
miles. But God the Sovereign of the Sun can speak to it, and it rises not. If
he do but give the word of command to the Sun not to rise, the morning shall be
made darkness, Amos 4.13. and the day dark with night Amos 5.8. Was it not so
in that three days darkness in Egypt? in that miraculous standing still of
the Sun in Joshua's days, Exodus 12.21. Josh. 10.13.
when the Sun rose not with the Antipodes one morning, and the stars were
sealed up part of the night? in that dismal darkness (mentioned by Lavater
upon this text) March 12. 1585, lasting for a quarter of an hour, and being so
like the night, that the fouls went to roost at noon, and many fell to their
prayers for pardon of their sins, as thinking verily that the day of judgment
was come. St. Paul in the tempest at sea saw neither Sun nor stars for many
days, Acts 27.20. And I have read of a forraigner, who having been in these
parts in the deep of winter, and returning home again, desired one that was
then bound for England to commend him to the Sun when he next saw him, for I
have not seen him there, said he, of a whole fortnight together. Ezekiel. 32.7. I
will cover the Sun with a cloud; and, in that sense, speak to it that it rise
not.

And seals up the stars] Heb. Sets a seal upon the stars, making them hide
their heads, and withdraw their influences: for stars are Gods storehouses,
Deuteronomy. 28.12. which he opens or shuts at his pleasure. Every star is like a
purse of gold: out of which God can, when he will, throw down riches and plenty
into the earth: but many of them never appear to us, though visible to the
Antipodes, Job 37.7.

Verse 8. Which alone spreads out the heavens] Without the help or counsel of
any other. As God was alone and by himself in making the world, Isa. 44.24. so
lie is in ordering it, Job 37.18. Psalm 104.1, 2. The Hebrews, as they held
with Pythagoras in the point of transanimation; so with Plato in that false
opinion of his, that the Angels were the movers of the heavens, and the
governors of the whole world; whence grew that Angel-worship amongst them,
Col. 2.18. As God made the heavens alone, even that whole Expanse or Firmament,
Genesis 1.6. the whole region of the Air; so he still spreads it out as a
curtain, which he draws before the Sun and stars, masking and muffling
them up with clouds, whenever he pleases.

And treads upon the waves of the sea] Or, spurneth, exercising a regiment
over the raging surges of the seas, though they seem to swell against him. Thus
Job fetches evidences of Gods power from all places. See Psalm 89.9.

Verse 9. Which makes Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades] Those glorious
constellations, which do after a sort, govern the four seasons of the year: but
are governed by God, from whose power all their influence and virtue is
borrowed, even that which they exercise upon the raging seas. The Learned
interpreters have not unfitly translated Has Acturus, Chesil Orion, Chimah
Pleiades, or the seven stars, and the Climates of the South, Beza.
the Summer signs; altogether neglecting the toys of the unlearned Rabbines:
which stars or signs are answerable to Autumn and Winter, the Spring time, and
Summer. But I had rather (says Reverend Mr. Beza) retain still the Hebrew
words, then use the other: which have been so much abused with glosure and
impure tales and devices of the wicked and profane Poets. See the Note on Job
38.31.

And the Chambers of the South] Interiora Austri, the most remote, hidden and
secret parts of the South; so called, because the stars which are under the
Southern pole are hidden from us, and are enclosed and lodged as in a chamber.
Those stars (and so all the rest) God makes, Mr. Car^l. Psalm 147.4.
that is, he makes them to appear and do their office for the use and good of
man. It is He alone that tells the number of the stars, he calls them by
their names: neither can they do any thing but as they receive order and
commission from him. Aug de civ. Dei lib. 16.
That was an idle brag of Aratus the Astrologer, that he had found out and set
down the whole number of the stars: and that is a strange arrogance of the
Kings of Mexico, who when they are consecrated, are reported to take this oath,
Lopez de Gomara.
I swear that the Sun, during my life, shall hold on his course: and that the
clouds shall send down rain, the rivers shall run, and the earth bring forth
all manner of fruit etc.

Verse 10 Which does great things etc.] See the Note on chap. 5.9. whence this
verse is taken verbatim. If Eliphaz say the truth of Gods wisdom and power,
Job will soon seal to it: he can find in his heart to speak all good of a
wounding God, of a killing God, and not wish as Spira did, O that I were above
God, and could overpower him! Camd. Eliz. fol. 403.
Or as Hacket here did, Anno 1591. threaten God to fire the heaven about him,
to pluck him out of his throne etc.

Verse 11. Lo he goes by me. and I see him not] As he is powerful in his
deeds, so he is secret in his desingns, passing, and not repassing daily, but
yet unseen: he is every where present, and not so far from any one of us, as
the bark is from the tree; for in him we live, move, and have our being; and
therefore we had need take heed what we say or think of him in any extremity or
misery, for he over-heareth us; yea he knows our thoughts long before, Psalm
139.2. As a circumspect judge that goes obscured under some disguise, to hear
and see what is said and done by those that are to be judged by him. Or as the
Great Turk standing behind the Arras, at the dangerous door, to hear all the
debates and decrees of his Senate, and to call them to a strict account of all
afterward: God, as he is invisible, too subtle for sinew or sight to seize
upon; so he is (...), All-eye, to survey and look round about us; yea, to see
through us: The Lord is in his holy-Temple, the Lords throne is in heaven:
Howbeit, he is not so confined or shut up there (as the Epicures dreamt) but
that his eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men, Psalm 11.4. The one
points out his knowledge, the other his judgment; or his critical descant: he
prieth into the very entrals of the soul, the heart of the heart; the reins,
those seats of lust, and most abstruse parts of the body. No man needs a window
in his breast (as the Heathen Momus wished) for God to look in at: every man
before God is all window, and he like the Optike virtue in the eye, sees all,
and is seen of none. Look to it therefore, and walk exactly. Cave, spectat
Cato, Take heed, Cato sees you, was an ancient watchword among the Romans, and
a great retentive from vice: how much more should this amongst all men, Take
heed, the Lord looks on? What though he be invisible, and we see him not; he
passes on also, and we perceive him not; shall we, like the foolish Bustard,
thrust our heads in an hole, and then think that because we see none, we are
therefore seen of none? The whole world is to God as a sea of glass, clear and
transparent, Rev. 4.6. and his eyes are as a flaming fire, Rev. 1.14. that need
no outward light, but can see by sending out a ray. God, that fills and sees
all (says Nazianzen) though he lighten the mind, yet flies before the beams
thereof, In carm.
still leaving it as it is able in sight to follow him; and so draws it by
degrees to higher things: yet interposeth betwixt it and his incomprehensible
Essence, as many vails as were over the Tabernacle.

Verse 12. Behold he takes away] Raptim aufert; He snatcheth away, or takes
by force, as a Lion does his prey, or a thief does another man's goods: Confer
Prove. 23.28. Which if he do, who can repel or turn him back? Here Job plainly
alludeth to the taking away of his children, servants, and cattle, the
likelihood also of losing his life (according to the Chaldee paraphrast) by his
present miseries, which if it should befall him from God, it would not be safe
for him to cavil, or once question Gods proceeding, to urge him to restitution,
or charge him with oppression; since he is chief Lord of all, and may do with
his own what he pleases. He is uncontrollable as Nebuchadnezzar at length
acknowledged, Dan. 4.35. and his will is the true and only rule of justice it
self, nec solum recta, sed and regula. Wherefore let all the earth keep silence
before him, Hab. 2.20. and let none presume once to ask him what he has done,
either to question his right to do it, or to question his righteousness in
doing of it.

Verse 13. If God will not withdraw his anger] That is, of his own free accord
forbear to execute his judgments, the stoutest must stoop; for he is in one
mind, and who can turn him! and what his soul desires even that he does, Job
23.13. his power is altogether irresistible. Men, though never so puissant, may
be withstood and over-matched, as Asa was, 2 Chronicles 14.8, 9. Nature may be
resisted, and her power suspended, as when the fire burned not the three
worthies, the red Sea drowned not the Israelites passing through it. In the
creatures there is an essence, and a faculty whereby they work; between these
God can separate, and so hinder their working. In the Angels there is an
essence, and an executive power: God comes between these sometimes, and hinders
them from doing what they would. But God is most simple and entire, and
therefore the strong helper: Qui portant orbem, says the Vulgar, that bear up
the pillars of the world (which some understand of the Angels, others of the
Saints, who stand in the gap, Ezekiel. 22.30. and others again of carnal
Combinations) shall not hinder him, but shall stoop and buckle under him, or
under it, viz. his wrath, as not able to bear up: helpers shall prove no
helpers against the mind and purpose of God: no, though they be as potent and
as proud as Egypt (such an allusion there may be in the Hebrew text) or
although they be helpers of latitude, as one renders it, that is, of the
largest extent, either in power, or by an elate mind, and so the meaning is.
None are so mighty, or so high-conceited of their own ability, but if he be
angry, he will make them to stoop under, as not being able to bear his wrath.

Verse 14. How much less shall I answer him] If heaven, earth, sea, cannot
stand before him, if strongest men, and strongly befriended, and seconded,
cannot make their party good with him, it is not for me to stout it out: but
rather to stoop and strike sail, seeking to disarm his indignation by an humble
yeildance; especially since I am not able to hold discourse with him, to answer
him one of a thousand; I not only have not arguments, but I want fit words; not
argumentative words only, but persuasive also.

And choose out my words to reason with him?] Heb. Shall I choose out words with
him? Broughton renders it, Shall I choose to word it with God? Surely my best
eloquence in this case will be a submissive silence. It can be neither wisdom
nor duty in me to deal with, and undertake God, either with an open or a closed
hand; either with Logical subtilties, or rhetorical flourishes. If I should
either be Respondent or Opponent, I should come off with loss.

Verse 15. Whom though I were righteous] Legally righteous, as none ever were,
but the first and second Adam.

Yet would I not answer] viz. by pleading mine own righteousness, since no
created righteousness can answer God. Some render it, non attollam vocem, ne
hiscere quidem audebo, I will not lift up my voice, nor dare to mute against
him. (See 1 Cor. 4.4.) No though I were never so innocent, and did suffer this
misery undeservedly.

But I would make supplication to my Judge] As he does, though it were a good
while first, in the end of the next chapter. It is likely that he intended to
do it sooner, but was put by by his passions; which when they fume up into the
head, gather often into so thick a cloud, that we lose the sight of our selves,
and what is best to be done. Jonas thought to have prayed chap. 4.1, 2. but it
proved a brawle; and when as by prayer he thought to overcome his anger, anger
overcame him and his prayer too.

Verse 16. If I had called and he had answered] If in confidence of mine own
righteousness I had sought some, good thing at his hands, and he had therein
condescended to me; yet would I not believe that he had (in mercy) hearkened to
my voice; but rather, for a further mischief, that he might roll himself upon
me, as Joseph upon his brethren, and as God did upon the Israelites after their
quails; that he might tear them with his tempest etc. Some think that Job
speaks these words, as despairing of audience, or denying Gods particular
providence: but neither of these is likely. Rather it seems (says Pineda) to
be the speech of a mind marvellously cast down, and meanly conceited of
himself, and of his prayer: and trusting to the goodness of God alone; so
Drusius. Job speaks not this, says he, out of diffidence, but out of fear of
Gods judgments, and sense of his own imperfections.

Yet I would not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice] Namely, for any
worth that he finds in it: what am I poor creature, that I should think I had
carried the matter with God?

Verse 17. For he breaks me with a tempest] q. d. This is one thing also that
makes me think I am not heard, because I am not helped; but after my prayer I
am in as bad a case as before, and seem to have a repulse from God. Afflictions
continued are no evidence that prayer is not heard; yet usually it is very
inevident to an afflicted person, that his prayer is heard. The Hebrew (and so
the Vulgar) has it, He will break me, that is, says one, If I should plead
before him as pure, although I might temporally, or for a time be delivered,
yet I should not finally escape destruction, although I should give him none
other cause. Whereby we may see upon what danger of being torn in pieces by
Gods judgments, our justiciaries put themselves, that will needs go to God in
their own righteousness, as the proud Pharisee, Luke 18. The calamity of these
merit-mongers shall rise suddenly. Behold a whirlwind, or a tempest of the
Lord goes forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind; it shall fall grievously
upon the head of these wicked ones, Jer. 23.19. This Saint Paul knew, and
therefore did his utmost that he might be found in Christ ( sc. when sought for
by the justice of God) not having his own righteousness, which is of the law,
but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of
God by faith. Philip. 3 9.

And multiplieth my wounds without cause] i. e. Without any other cause then to
try me, and prove my patience, which now Job began to perceive, as Philip
gathers, or without any manifest cause, and perceivable by an afflicted man,
so Aquinas senseth it. God has not told me the reason of his chastenings; but
to increase my grief, he concealeth from me the cause of them; and yet he
multiplieth still my sores and my sorrows. Or without cause, that is, without
any such cause as his friends alleged against him, viz. that he was a rank
hypocrite.

Verse 18. He will not suffer me to take my breath] I am so far from a period,
that I have no pause of my troubles. I cannot get any interspiria's, or free
breathing-whiles. See chap. 7.19. And in the former verse he had complained,
that God had stormed him. Interim per Pathos, says Mercer; here he returns to
his old practice of expostulating about the greatness of his grief, and spares
not to hyperbolize. Beda, and others understand this text of a bodily distemper
upon Job, which had made him short-winded. And Lavater has this good note
here, Hoc cogitandum nobis est etc. Let this text be thought upon when our
spirits begin to sink; as also when by reason of the Ptisick, or any other like
disease, we feel a difficulty of breathing, and a straitening of our pectorals,
or be otherwise compassed about with great sorrows.

But fills me with bitternesse] Heb. He satiateth me with bitternesses, i. e.
with sore and sharp afflictions, which are no way joyous, but grievous to the
flesh, Heb. 12.11. Job had his belly-full of gall and wormwood: he had not
only a draught or two, but a diet-drink made him of most bitter ingredients. Of
this he complains heavily: what then will the wicked do that must suck up the
dregs of Gods cup, Psalm 78.8. which has eternity to the bottom?

Verse 19. If I speak of strength, lo he is strong] Neither by might nor right
can I deal with him: Broughton renders it, As for force, he is valiant; the
Lord is a man of war, says Moses, Exodus 15.3. Yea, he is the Lord of arms.
says David, Psalm. 84. Yea, He alone is a whole army of men, Van and Rere both,
says Isaiah cap. 52.12. there is no doubt then, but he will carry the day,
since no creature is able to grapple with him. The weakness of God (if any such
thing there were) is stronger then men, 1 Cor. 1.25. and by weakest means, he
can effect greatest matters, as once he did in Egypt.

And if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?] Who shall appoint the
time and place of our meeting? If I shall go about to sue him at law, I shall
have but a cold suit, an ill pull of it: for who shall make him appear, or
bring him to his answer? and where shall I find an advocate, a patron to plead
my cause? yea, where shall I get a witness? for so the vulgar reads it, Nemo
audet pro me restimonium dicere: No man will be so bold as to give an evidence
for me, or be a witness on my side.

Verse 20. If I justify my self] If, in default of other pleaders, I should
undertake to manage my cause my self, I should be never the near.

Mine own mouth shall condemn me] i. e. God out of mine own mouth, as finding
mine arguments weak and worthless: He knows us better then we know our
selves; and when he comes to turn the bottom of the bag upwards (as once
Joseph's steward did theirs) all our secret thefts will out, and those will
appear to be faults that we little thought of. A Dutch Divine, when to die, was
full of fears and doubts; said some to him, you have been so employed, and so
faithful, why should you fear? Oh, said he, the judgment of man, and the
judgment of God are different. Vae hominum vitae quantumvis laudabili, si
remota misericordia judicetur; Woe to the most praiseworthy man alive, if he
meet with judgment without mercy. The best lamb should abide the slaughter,
except the ram were sacrificed, that Isaak might be saved.

If I say, I am perfect] What if God had said so, chap. 1.1. yet. Job might
not, Prove. 27.2. 2 Cor. 10.18. Or if he do at any time justify himself, as
chap. 29. and 30 he does, it is in his own necessary and just defense, against
the charge of his friends. Real apologies we must ever make for our selves when
wronged: verbal, if any, must be managed with meekness of wisdom.

Verse 21. Though I were perfect] That is, of an unblameable conversation, yet
could not I know mine own soul, that is, those secret sins Psalm 19.12. those
litters of lusts that lurk therein, therefore I despise my life, I have no joy
at all of it, but could wish to be out of the world, to be rid of these evil
inmates, that will not out of doors till the house fall upon the heads of them,
till the earthly Tabernacle that harbors them be once dissolved. Others read
and sense the words thus, I am perfect or upright, neither do I know mine own
soul, i. e. quicquam perversi in anima mea, any allowed sin in my soul; yet I
am so afflicted, that I despise my life, as being but a continued death.
Aben-Ezra reads the verse with an admiration, thus, Perfect I am; and think you
that I know not mine own soul* that I am so great a stranger to my self! or,
that I have so little care of mine own good, as that I despise my life, and
walk at all adventures! Tremellius thus, I am upright, whatever you my friends
would make of me, neither value I my life or soul in comparison of mine
integrity: my life is but a trifle to my conscience etc.

Verse 22. This is one thing, therefore I say it] And will stand to it, though
I stand alone; this being the one thing wherein I differ in opinion from you;
and because it is the hinge upon which the whole dispute betwixt us is turned,
therefore I will abide by it, and be Doctor resolutus, resolute in the
maintenance of it, viz.

He destroys the perfect and the wicked] A harsh doctrine, yet a good one,
says an Interpreter: Grace is no target against the greatest affliction. See
Eccles. 9.1, 2, 3. Mal. 3.14. Ezekiel. 21.3. Heb. 11. shows that none out of hell
have ever suffered more then Gods dearest children: and Heb. 12.6. He not only
chasteneth, but scourges every son whom he receives. God will not cast away a
righteous man said Bildad, chap. 8.20. That is, totally destroy him in
temporals, but restore him again: no such matter, says Job, for it may, and
many times does fall out, that a godly man may as to this life present, perish,
as well as a wicked man: he may be totally and finally bereft of outward
comforts, The righteous perishes, Isa. 57.1. Only with this difference, as
has been before noted, Gods judgments on the wicked are penal and typical of
eternal torment; whereas upon the godly they are no more then medicinal or
probational etc.

Verse 23. If the scourge slay suddenly] By scourge here is meant a common
calamity, such as rides circuit, compassing a country as a scourge does a man's
body round about. Any sweeping judgment is a swinging scourge in Gods hand;
such as is the sword, Isai. 10.26. which when it rides circuit (as a judge) it
is in commission, Turk. hist. 211
Ezekiel 14.17. Jer. 47.6, 7. devouring flesh, and drinking blood. Thus Attila the
H^nne styled himself Gods scourge. Tamerlane was commonly called The wrath of
God, and terror of the world; Think the same of famine, pestilence, wild
beasts, Ezekiel. 14.12. etc. these often slay suddenly Isai. 30.13. Jer. 18.22. as
did the sweating sickness here in England, the Massacre of France, and that
later of Ireland, that scourge, if ever any, slew suddenly the perfect and the
wicked. When an overflowing storm sweeps away the wicked, the tail of it may
dash their best neighbors.

He laugheth at the trial of the innocent] The Vulgar reads, He will not
laugh at the trial of the innocent: but there is no Not in the Original: others
thus, Will he laugh at the trial of the innocent? q. d. No, he will not. God
may seem to slight his own in affliction, as Psalm 77.2, 3. The Lion lets her
whelps roar sometimes, till they do almost kill themselves with roaring. The
truth is, (and I think the true sense of this Scripture) God scorneth the
allegation of innocence, or the justification and plea of the most upright man
breathing, Mr. Abbot.
in the way of exemption or prevention of his just and wise dispensations, when
he pleases to inflict them, involving good and bad in the same common calamity.

Verse 24. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked] God many times
suffers the wicked most licentiously to reign in the world, Jer. 27.6. Dan.
5.18, 19. And it is thought by some, that Job speaking here in the singular
number, aims at some famous tyrant in those parts, known both to himself and to
his friends: such as was Phocas the Emperor, who when he had slain his Master
Mauritius, and was set up in his stead; there was an honest poor man (says
Ce^renus) who was wonderful importunate at the throne of grace to know a reason
why that wicked man prospered so in his design? he was answered again by a
voice, that there could not be a worse man found; and that the sins of
Christians, and of the City of Constantinople did require it.

He covers the faces of the Judges thereof] i. e. That Tyrant
abovementioned, subverteth all order of justice, condemns and puts to
death even the Judges themselves, Spartian.
if they will not pervert justice, as Bassia^us did Papinian. The covering of
the face was the mark of a condemned man, Esth. 7.8. Job. 40.8. Isai. 12.17.
Mar. 14.65. Or thus, God blinds the Judges by giving them over to error, or
permitting them to take bribes; so that they cannot discern right from wrong
etc. Some by judges here understand the Saints, who shall one day judge the
world, but are in the meanwhile grievously afflicted by the wicked.

If not, where, and who is he?] Which things, if we say they are done, besides
the will and foreknowledg of God, we shall thrust God out of the world, and set
up fate and blind fortune: or thus, It is even so; or if not where is he, and
who is he (see Esth. 7.5. Mal. 2.17) that can disprove what I have asserted?
Mercer. pagnin. Vatab.
prodeat, siqui^ me potest falsi arguere, I would fain see the man that can
convince me of error.

Verse 25. Now my days are swifter then a p^st etc.] Not my prosperous days
only (as Broughton glosseth) but the whole course of my life; the vanity
whereof Job expresses by many similitudes; and here search is made into three
of the four Elements, earth, water, and air, to find out a fit one. What is
swifter upon earth then a post, who rides without stop o^ stay, and spares for
no horseflesh: indeed he takes some time to rest in; but so does not man's
lise; it is ever in motion, and every moment we yield somewhat to death.
Animantis cujusque vita est f^^a. says the Philosopher, our last day stands,
the rest run. Cum crescit vita, decrescit, to live is but to lie a dying. Sen.


They flee away] As David fled from the face of Absalom, Psalm 3.1. as Brentius
was advised by that Senator of Hala to flee for his life cito, citius,
citissime, with all possible speed, since they were at hand that sought it. See
1 Samuel 19.11, 18.

They see no good] But are few, and withal evil, Genesis 47.9. Job 14.1. See the
notes there. Some good days Job had had, but they were so soon over (and his
present pressures so great) that he was scarce aware of them, nor could take
the comfort of them now: the Epicures indeed held that a man might be cheerful
amidst the most exquisite torments ex praeteritarum voluptatum recordatione,
Cic. de Fin. l. 2. Sen. de benef. l. 4. c. 22.
by the remembrance of those pleasures and delights that formerly he had
enjoyed. Job held this but a slight comfort: his care was in prosperity how to
make the best use of it: his thoughts ran upon the uncertainty of all
creature comforts, that he might hang loose to them, and hold them no otherwise
then a child does a bird in his hand, open etc.

Verse 26. They are passed away as the swift ships] Heb. They are changed
(gliding away insensibly) as the ships of desire (so called, Labitur uncta
vadis abies. Virg.
because they seem willing to beat the haven as soon as may be) or as the ships
of Ebeh, a very swift river in Arabia, says Rabbi Solomon; or as the Pirates
ships, so Broughton, such as are your nimble Frigots, fly-boats, and catches
etc. Let our souls be like a ship which is made little and narrow down-ward;
but more wide and broad upward. Let them be ships of desire, hastening
heavenward; and then let our days pass away as they can, we shall but be the
sooner at home: Mortality shall appear to be no small mercy.

As the Eagle that hastes to the prey] When hunger adds swiftness to her
wings, and makes her pour, or sowce down upon the prey like a thunderbolt; so
transitory is our time: redeem it therefore. It is reported of Ignatius, that
when he heard a clock strike, he would say, Here is one hour more now past,
that I have to answer for.

Verse 27. If I say, I will forget my complaint,] And suffer in silence, as
thou Bildad have advised me, chap. 8.2. Sorrows are not so easily forgotten,
Lam. 3.19. remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
The Stoics boasting of their indolency, or ability to bear afflictions,
without making moan, or complaining, when it came to their own turn, found by
experience that they had spoken more trimly then truly; and therefore one
Dionysius, surnamed (...), or the Flincher, fell off (for this reason) from the
Stoics to the Peripateticks.

I will leave off my heavinesse] Heb. my face, viz. the sowrnesse that used to
sit upon it, as 1 Samuel 1.18. The Pharisees were vultuosi tetrici inamoeni,
Matthew 6.16. of a sad and sour countenance, grim, and ghastly: they affected to
look like Scythians, as the word signifies, that they might seem great
fasters, when as inwardly they were merry and pleasant. Jobs case was far
different: his heart was heavy as lead; nevertheless, to give content to his
friends, he would endeavor to look lightsomely, but found a very hard task of
it.

And comfort my self] Heb. strengthen, viz. so as not to make moan, but bite
in my pain. Invalidumomne natura querulum, the weaker any thing is, the more
apt it is to complain; and on the contrary, some men's flesh will presently
rankle and fester, if but razed with a pin only: so some men's spirits, they
are ever whining.

Verse 28. I am afraid of all my sorrows] That come thronging thick about me,
and terrify me; they will surely be doubled and trebled upon me; hence my
sorrow is uncurable; if I should resolve never so much against it, I should
break my resolution, and fall to fresh complaints, Psalm 39.1, 3. Hic vides,
says Lavater. Here we may see how little is to be ascribed to man's free will
in the things of God, since it is not in our power to comfort and cheer up our
selves under afflictions, though we would never so fain.

I know that thou will not hold me innocent] But wilt hold me guilty, and
accordingly punish me. This was the language of Johs fear: had his faith been
in heart, it would have quelled and killed such distrustful fears, and have
gathered one contrary out of another, life out of death, assurance of
deliverance out of deepest distresses, Deuteronomy. 32.36. So 2 Kings 14.26. going
into captivity was a sign of Isreal's returning out of captivity.

Verse 29. If I be wicked] Heb. I am wicked, sc. in your thoughts, and you have
so earnestly and effectually affirmed it, and confirmed it, that I am almost
ready to say as you say, I am wicked. Plato brings in Socrates in his apology
to the Judges, thus bespeaking them, My Lords, I know not how you have been
affected with mine accusers eloquence whiles you heard them speak: for mine own
part, I assure you that I whom it touches most, was almost drawn to believe
that all they said, though against my self, was true, when they scarcely
uttered one word of truth. The Chaldee paraphrase reads it, I shall be
culpable, or, I shall be condemned.

Why then labor I in vain?] Or, for nothing, as the Chaldee has it. See the
like Psalm 73.13, 14. Why put I my self to so much fruitless pains, either in
praying to God, or apologizing to you my friends, since by God I am still
afflicted, and by you reputed a wicked person? Jobs hope was low, his endeavor
was therefore little. Si nihil sperarem, nihil orarem, says one. Let us pray
on: God sometimes defers to come, till men have even left looking for him, till
he scarce finds says upon earth, Luke 18.8.

Verse 30. If I wash my self with snow-water] Some take the former words I am
wicked, to be Jobs confession of his own sinfulness in comparison of Gods
surpassing holiness. And then this follows very fitly, Though I wash my self
with snow water, i. e. with water as clear as show is white. Some read it aquis
vivis for aquis nivis, spring water for snow-water.

And make my hands never so clean] Though I wash my hands with soap, (so some
read it) as Jer. 2.22. Mal. 3.2. Or, Though I wash mine hands in a well (where
there is no want of water) both inside and outside, as Jam. 4.8.

Verse 31. Thou shall plunge me in the ditch] Thou shall declare me to be no
less loathsome, then he that having fallen into a foul guzzle, or nasty jakes,
abhors himself and his own clothes, being ready to lay up his gorge at the
sight and smell of them. The Vulgar has it, Sor^ibus intinges me, thou shall
dip me in the dirt over head and ears, and stain me all over, as Diers do the
cloth they color. By the ditch, Beza and others understand the grave; and by
clothes, grave-cloaths, q. d. My very winding sheet shall abhor my filthiness.
Take the proud Pharisee for instance, and Popish merit-mongers, whom the Lord
abhors.

Verse 32. For he is not a man as I am] He is not such an one, nor can be, as I
am, and must be: he has other eyes, and thoughts, and ways then creatures
have. He who is just before men, is unjust before God; therefore he is no fit
match for me to contend withal: Have I an arm like God? or can I thunder with a
voice like him? chap. 40.9? Is it safe to contend with him that is mightier
then I, Eccles. 6.10? Surely if I should be so mad as to justify my self, yet
I should soon be given to know, that that which is highly esteemed amongst men,
is an abomination in the sight of God, Luke 16.15.

And we should come together in judgment] How can that possibly be, when as God
is the supreme Judge; neither is there any appealing from, or repealing of his
sentence?

Verse 33. Neither is there any Dayes-man betwixt us] Heb. Any Arguer or
Reprover, as Genesis 31.24. We call him an Umpire or Referree, who has power to
reprove and to lay the blame where he finds it, and finally to compromise the
business. The late Judge Dyer amongst us, if there came any controversies of
poor men to be tried before him, would usually say, that either the parties are
wilful, or their neighbors without charity, because their suits were not
quietly ended at home. Now, says Job, as there is no Judge, so there is no
dayes-man betwixt me and God. If one man sin against another, says good old
Eli. the Judge shall judge him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who can
mediate? 1 Samuel 2.24.

That may lay his hand] To moderate and keep us both in compass, and to
compose the difference.

Verse 34. Let him take his rod away from me] Having sufficiently set forth
that he will not once offer to contend with God, he here humbly begs of God, no
further to contend with him, but to grant a truce at leastwise during the
treaty; and either to take away or (howsoever) to mitigate his sorrows and
sores. See the like chap. 15.20, 21.

And let not his fear terrify me] i. e. His formidablenesse (see chap. 7.14.)
let it not scare me, or put me, as it were, beside my wits. Psalm 88.15. Ne me
transversum aga^. Sept.


Verse 35. Then would I speak and not fear him] I would come boldly to the
throne of grace, and freely pour out my soul into his bosom. If he meant that
he would maintain his own cause against Gods proceedings (as some understand
it, grounding upon chap. 33.6, 7.) he was questionless in a very great error,
and the flesh had got the hill of the Spirit.

But it is not so with me] So, how? so as you imagine: Vatab.
Non sum talis, qualem me esse putatis, I am no such one as you take me for,
viz. an hypocrite: I am not so self-guilty, say the Septuagint: or thus, It is
not so with me: that is, I do not find God answering my suit: for I am still
scourged and frighted, so that I scarce know what I say.

CHAP. X. Verse 1. My soul is weary of my life.]
BEcause it is a lifelesse life. Mortis habet vires, a death more like. Life is
sweet, and every creature makes much of it, from the highest Angel in heaven,
to the lowest worm on earth. The Scripture sets it forth as a sweet mercy,
Genesis 45.28. Lam. 3.39. Esth. 7.3. Jer. 39.18. and 45.5. But God can so imbitter
it with outward and inward troubles, that it shall become a burden. I am weary
of my life (says good Rebecca, Genesis 27.46.) and what good shall my life do me?
David forced to be in bad company, cries, Oh that I had the wings of a dove
etc. Woe is me that I sojourn in Meshech etc. Elias fleeing from Jezabel,
requested for himself that he might dye, saying, It is enough Lord, take away
my life, for I am not better then my fathers, 1 Kings 19.4. No: Heb. 1^.
but God had provided some better thing for him (as the Apostle speaks in
another case) for he was shortly after translated and taken out of the reach
both of Jezabel whom he feared, and of death which he desired; Sed multi magni
viri, sub Eliae junipero sedent, says one, Many good men sit under Eli^s his
juniper, wishing to be out of the world, if God were so pleased, that they
might rest from their labors, and be rid of their many burdens and bondages;
as in the mean while, they rather endure life then desire it, as holding it
little better then hell, were it not for the hopes they have of heaven
hereafter.

I will leave my complaint upon my self] Liberty I will take to complain,
whatever come of it. I will lay the reins in the neck, and let my passions have
their full swinge at my peril. See the like chap. 13.3. Verum Job hac in re
nimius, says Mercer, but Job was too blame in doing and saying thus; and it is
to be attributed to the infirmity of his flesh, wherewith, although the spirit
do notably combat, yet the flesh seems sometimes, and in some sort to get the
better; Nimis augusta res est, ^^spaim errare, says one; Barclai. Euphorm.
Triste mortalitatis privilegium est; licere aliquando peccare, says another.
The snow-like swan has black legs: and in many things we offend all: Gold is
not to be refused because it wants some grains, and has a crack etc.

I will speak in the bitterness of my soul] And so seek to ease my grief by
giving a vent unto it. But it is evident, that such out-bursts and overflowings
of the gall and spleen come from a fullness of bad humors.

Verse 2. I will say unto God, Do not condemn me] You may say so, as an humble
suppliant, but not as holding your self innocent, and therefore harshly dealt
with. The Hebrew is, Do not make me wicked: rather do good, o Lord, to those
that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts; but lead me not
forthwith the workers of iniquity, as a melefactor is led forth to execution,
Psalm. 125.5.

Show me wherefore thou contendest with me] i. e. Quare sic me affligas, says
Vatablus, why thou thus afflictest me, whether for sin, or for trial; and this
Job desired to know, not to satisfy his curiosity, but his conscience, as one
well observes; and that the world might be satisfied, the rash judgment of his
friends confuted, and answered by a determination from heaven.

Verse 3. (...) it good unto thee that thou should oppress?] It is the guise
of wicked judges to take this counsel, to follow this course; whom thou, being
a most just and righteous judge, Beza.
can not confirm or encourage by thine own example, as it were by a light
shining from above. Thus Job rhetoricateth; his complaints are high, yet ever
with an allay or mixture of modesty.

That thou should despise the work of thine hands] i. e. Me thy poor
creature; will thou do and undo? make a man, and unmake him again for thy minds
sake? Builders use not to ruin what they have built: Artificers love and plead
for their own handiwork: Fathers foster their children with all tenderness.
Some Authors dote upon their own doings, as Laurentius Valla did upon his
Logic, as if there had been none such; calling it in a bravado Log^c^m
Laurentinam: and as Ca^pian the Jesuit did upon his ten leaden reasons, which
he deemed and boasted to be unanswerable. Heliod^rus would rather be
unbishopped, then yield that his Ethiopick history (a toilesome toy, but the
brat of his brain) should be abolished. The Saints are Gods building, 1 Cor.
3.9. Handiwork; Ephesians. 2.18. Children, Job 1.12. Epistle known and read of all
men, 2 Cor. 3.2, 3. This if we plead, when sorely afflicted (as the Church did
Isa. 64.8. And David, Psalm 138.8. and Job here) we may have any thing. See
that notable text Isaiah 45.11. And that other Isai. 59.16.

And shine upon the counsel of the wicked] That is, favor and further their
designs: God makes his Sun to shine upon such, but himself never shines upon
them: he may be angry enough with men, though they outwardly prosper; yea, to
prosper in sin is a most heavy judgment. See Zac^. 1.15. with the note there.

Verse 4. Have thou eyes of flesh?] Which see but the surface of things, and
not that neither in the dark. Have thou not fiery eyes Rev. 1.14. that need no
outward light, but see by sending out a ray, and pierce the inward parts also?
Have thou not made the eye? yea the optic virtue in the eye, which sees all,
and is seen of none? If the Sun be the eye of the world, God is much more; the
Greeks give him his name from seeing, (...).
because he sees through and through: eyes he has, but not of flesh: he
sees, but not as man.

Or see thou as man sees?] Art thou subject to error, ignorance,
partiality, popularity, etc. Proceedest thou not according to truth (yea, truth
in the inward parts) and not according to opinion or appearance? Of a good Judge
it is said, that he does neque suspicere, nec despicere, nec respicere, nec
circumspicere; neither look up nor down, nor this way nor that, but straight
forward to the cause, and not to the person. Of a just law it is said, that it
is an heart without affection, an eye without lust, a mind without passion, a
treasurer which keeps for every man what he has, and distributeth to every
man what he ought to have; so and much more then so is God, whatever thoughts
might arise sometimes in Jobs heart to the contrary.

Verse 5. Are thy days as the days of man?] Art thou mortal and short-lived
as sorry man is, that thou proceedest in this sudden and severe manner, as if
thou should not have time enough to try me, and to take an order with me?
Art not thou eternal, and do thou not know in the indivisible moment of thine
eternity, all what has been, is, and shall be? Known unto God are all his
works from the beginning of the world, Acts 15.18. yea, long before. The truth
is, neither foreknowledg, nor remembrance are properly in God, since all things
both past and future are present with him, Romans 4.17. 2 Pet. 3.8. Jer 1.5, 6,
7. Psalm. 139.2. and all things without him are but as a point or ball, which
with as much ease he discerns, as we turn our eyes.

Are thy years as many days;] It is well observed that Gods time is set out by
years, man's by days; his time is so short, that it is reckoned by the shortest
complete time, a day. The days of our years are threescore and ten, Psalm
90.10. As for God, he is not only the Ancient of days, Dan. 7.9. But the days
Ancient, for he made the day.

Verse 6. That thou inquire after mine iniquity etc.] viz. By strong pains,
and mighty terrors: as judges sometimes make inquisition by torture, to find
out treason or other heinous offense. What, would thou that I should confess
my self a wicked person?

Verse 7. Thou know that I am not wicked] A lewd liver, and a rank hypocrite
as these men would make of me; a sinner I am, but I allow not, wallow not in
any known sin: there is no way of wickedness found in me; hypocrisy reigns
not in my heart: Haeret in regenitis peccatum, says one, sin abides in the
best; yet they may not, they must not be called wicked. Cyril. lib. 9. i^
Julian.
Julian the Apostate affirmed that Peter's halting at Antioch, was so taxed by
Paul, that Peter must needs be an hypocrite; but this cavil and calumny can
never be proved from Paul's words, for not every one that through infirmity
dissembleth sometimes, is presently an hypocrite. It is upon thy knowledge,
says Job, that however I am weak, yet wicked I am not: my great scumme is not
in me, Ezekiel. 24.11, 12. The good heart admits not the mixture of any sin; like
right wine or honey, as the scumme arises, it ever casts it out: as
spring water works it self clean: as the sea will endure no poisonful thing,
but casts it up upon the shore, so a Christian clears himself of sin. Well it
may cleave to it for a while, as dross does to silver, but it enters not into
the frame and constitution: Job is confident of that, and will venture all upon
it.

And there is none (or nothing) that can deliver out of thine hands] q. d. Thus
thou, Lord, know it to be with me, that I have no wicked heart: but for
this, Junius.
I expect not to be delivered, for thou can still find matter in me for which
to lay thine hand upon me: But the more I submit my self, the more mild
should thou surely be in thy dealings toward me; as a Lion to a man crouching
to him: as Paul said, I know nothing by my self, yet am I not thereby
justified 1 Cor. 4.4. So Job says, Lord, thou know nothing by me, yet
hereby I cannot be delivered.

Verse 8. Thine hands have made me,] Or thoroughly and accurately wrought me, as
it were, with much pains and labor: thou have exactly fashioned all my
members; not that God either has hands, or puts himself to pains; for he
does his work without either tool or toil, Isai. 40.28. But this is attributed
to him after the manner of men, to show the curious workmanship showed in man's
creation, the masterpiece of all his works of wonder. This David sweetly
s;ingeth of Psalm 139. and Galen admireth in that excellent book of his De usu
partium humani corporis, setting forth the praises of that God whom he knew
not, and singing an hymn unto him. Lib 3.
Man, says one, is cura divini ingenii, he is Gods scutcheon wherein he has
portrayed all the titles of the most excellent beauties of the world. The Sun,
Moon, and Stars, are but the works of Gods fingers, Psalm 8. but man is the
work of his hands, Psalm 139.14. He is the most beautiful building of a most
wise architect, says Euripides: the bold attempt of daring nature, says
another heathen: the greatest of all miracles, says a third. David speaking of
him, and of Gods goodness to him, begins to wonder before he speaks, and
leaves off to speak, but not to wonder, Psalm 8.^, 9.

And fashioned me together round about] A metaphor from potters, who make their
work by turning it round till it be all finished. Jer. 18 3. Thou have
fashioned me, and made me in every point, so Broughton renders it. Totum me,
non dimidium. Thou have made the whole, and every part of me from top to toe,
not my nails excepted, (as Mercer has it) with extraordinary care and
cunning, bestowing upon me mercies enough betwixt head and foot, to fill a
volume. Who is there (says Galen) which looking but upon the skin only of man's
body, wondreth not at the artifice of the Creator? but especially he was amazed
at the manner of the motion of the lungs by Systole and Diastole, and would
needs offer hecatombs to that God whosoever he were, that was Author of so
admirable and excellent a piece of work.

Yet thou do destroy me] And this seems strange to me, Do thou yet
destroy me? (so some read this text) will thou swallow me up quick and devour
me, as the greater fishes do the lesser? (See the Note on verse 3.) Carest thou
not that I am thy workmanship created unto good works, Ephesians. 2.10? One in whom
thou have erected the fair fabric of the new man? for this also Job may here
very likely refer to.

Verse 9. Remember, I beseech thee, that thou have made me as the clay:]
Remembrance and foreknowledg are not properly in God, as was noted before on
verse 5. But he is said to remember us, when he relieveth us, Psalm 136.23. and
9.18. 1 Samuel 1.19. That thou have made me etc. viz. in those Protoplasts, my
first parents, formed out of the ground, Genesis 2.7. whence the Heathen
Philosopher could say, (...) Arian. in Epict.
that man is nothing else but a piece of clay weakly made up: or thou have
wrought me like clay, sc. in the womb, where thou have framed and formed my
body, as the potter works his clay, well-tempered, into an earthen vessel.
Here then Job in-minds the Lord (by the matter whereof he was made) of the
frailty, vility and impurity of his nature ( Lutum enim conspurcat omnia, sic
and caro) to move him to a mitigation of his misery. See Psalm. 103.14. and
78.39.

Will thou bring me into the dust again] viz. By those grievous torments: Or,
And that thou will bring me into dust again: for so thou have said, to dust
shall thou return, Genesis 3.19. And it is appointed for all men once to die, Heb.
9.27. Oh therefore that I might have some small rest and respite, before I go
hence, and be no more seen, Psalm. 39.12, 13.

Verse 10. Have thou not poured me out as milk] Or, melted me, that is, made me
of some such thing as liquid and white milk. Generationem hominis describit;
Man is a very mean thing in his first conception, modestly here set forth by
the making of cheeses. Vatab.


Vnde superbit homo, cujus concept^o turpis,
Nasci poena, labor vit^, necesse more?
Concerning man's formation in the womb, see the Naturallists, and Lactantius de
Opificio Dei cap. 12. but especially Psalm 139. where, and in this text there
is enough spoken to satisfy us about this great natural mystery, says Mercer:
that is a good Moral that one makes of it; God strains out the motes of
corruption from a godly-man, while his heart is poured out like milk with grief
and fear, whereby the iniquity of Jacob is purged, and this is all the fruit to
take away his sin, Isa. 27.9.

And crudled me like cheese] Siccastissimo ore, and elegantibus metaphoris,
says an Interpreter, Bodin. theat. nature. 434. Arist. de genesis anim. cap. 20.
i. e. Thus in a most modest manner, and with elegant metaphors, does Job, as a
great Philosopher, set out man's conception in the womb. Aristotle (whose manner
is obscurioribus obscura implicare, as Bodin observes) has some such
expression as this, but nothing so clear and full.

Verse 11. Thou have clothed me with skin and flesh] Out of that soft and
liquid substance (the slime of my parents loins) grossed first into a rude
fleshy mass, and consolidated, Thou have made not only a thin skin, and firm
flesh, but also hard bones, and knitting nerves; and all this for a garment or
guardment to those more noble inward parts, the brain, heart, liver, etc. which
Job here accounts to be the man, when he says, Thou have clothed me, that is,
my vital parts with the upper garment of skin, and with the under-garment of
flesh, all which, and the rest of the parts, both similar and organical, are in
their original but the same matter which God has thus diversified, and all by
the book, Psalm 139.16. Had he left out any member in his common-place-book,
thou had wanted it, says one.

And have fenced me with bones and sinews] Bones are the pillars of the body,
giving it stability, straightness and form. The Rabbines say, there are as
many of them in man's body, as there are affirmative precepts in the law, that
all his bones may say, Lord, who is like unto thee etc? Psalm 35.10. By the
sinews are the bones knit together, that upon them man may move from place to
place, as he pleases. Sense also and Motion is by these, in their wonderful
and inexplicable conjugations, conveyed to the rest of the parts. It is God
alone that knows how the bones (think the same of the sinews, arteries,
veins, gristles, flesh and blood etc.) do grow in the womb of her that is with
child, Eccles. 11.5. The Anatomists find out every day almost new wonders; and
an Ancient styles Man the miracle of miracles. Besides what is seen, Mr. Caryl.
God has pack many rarieties, mysteries, yea, miracles together in man's chest.
And surely, says one, if all the Angels in heaven had studied to this day,
they could not have cast man into a more curious mould, or have given a fairer,
or more (...) edition of him.

Verse 12. Thou have granted me life] i. e. Into my body thus formed and
organized, thou have infused a soul, Vatab.
that principle of life quickened me in the womb, and brought me alive out of
it: which because it is a miracle of mercy, therefore (...) adds favor, thou
have granted me (Heb. thou have wrought with me) life and fav^^^. Thou have
dealt life and goodness unto me; that is, thou have given me life accompanied
with thy goodness and blessings; so Beza senseth it. Some understand it of the
reasonable soul; others of the beauty of the body according to Isa. 40 6.

And thy visitation has preserved my Spirit] i. e. Thy good providence has
safe guarded me from innumerable deaths and dangers. Puerilitas est periculorum
pelagus, children are apt to run into mischief; and those of riper years are
subject to a thousand disasters and evil-occurrences. Gods special care is
exercised over his, as is sweetly expressed Psalm 121. and Psalm 23. ( David's
pastoral:) and Psalm 3. where David doubts not of safety, though asleep, and
in the midst of enemies, because God sustained him: when as Samson and
Ishbosheth, a sleep in the midst of friends, were circumvented, because
deserted by him: oh pray, pray, that the Lord Jesus Christ would be ever with
our spirits: visit him in duty, that he may visit us in mercy.

Verse 13. And those things have thou hid in thine heart] Legendum hoc cum
stomach^, says Mercer: And have thou indeed hid these things in thine heart?
What things means Job? his afflictions, which God was long before preparing
for him, and now took his time to lay load upon him, to be revenged on him at
unawares, and at greatest advantage. If this be the fense of Jobs words (as
some would conclude from the next verses) he was mightily mistaken; and this
was atrox querimonia, a grievous complaint, and unworthy of God, who lies not
at the catch, nor pretends fair, when he intends otherwise. A Cain may do
so to Abel, Esau to Jacob, Absalom to Amn^n, Joab to Amasa etc. The Creator
needs not daub or prevaricate thus with his creatures: if Job thought he did
with him, Job was utterly out, though for confirmation he add, I know that
this is with thee; I am sure that thou have dealt thus closely and covertly
with me, and that thy plagues have surprised me. O these still revenges! Merlin
and others understand by those thing hid in Gods heart, and which he was well
assured could not have befallen him without Gods will and decree, the mercies
which in the former verses Job had recounted and reckoned up, viz. his
conception, quickening, preservation; all which he looked upon as love tokens
coming out of the heart of God, and from the spring of special love. Here then
we see whence we may fetch comfort when most hardly bestead: namely, from those
effects whereby God sealed up his love to us in forming us in the womb; but
especially in his Covenant of Grace, that bee-hive of heavenly honey, whereby
he has engaged to be our God even from the womb to the tomb; yea, to all
perpetuity. Hereunto Job had respect, and so had David, Psalm 22.10, 11. and
Psalm 25.10.

Verse 14. If I sin, then thou markest me] Though through humane frailty only I
offend ( and ni^is dedignatur mortalitatem qui peccasse erubescit,) Enphorm.
thou soon notest it, thou followest me up and down, as it were, with pen, ink
and paper, to set down my faults. How then, say some, that God sees not sin in
his children? Job thought the Lord was over-strict with him (which yet could
not be) and that he put no difference betwixt him and those that were
notoriously wicked, as the next words import.

And thou will not acquit me from mine iniquity] That is, from the punishment
of mine iniquity. Verba diffidentis, says Mercer: words spoken according to
the judgment of the flesh, says Diodate, which holds Gods visitations to be
punishments and vengeances.

Verse 15. If I be wicked, woe unto me] Here he brings a Dilemma, whereby he
declares himself every way miserable, faith Mercer; whether he be bad or good,
suffer he must without remedy. If I be wicked, woe unto me; woe is the wicked
man's portion; tell him so from me, says God, Isai. 3.10, 11. Though he love
not to hear on that ear, but can bless himself in his heart, when God curses
him with his mouth, Deuteronomy. 29.19. And a godly man sets the terror of sins
woes before his flesh, that slave, that must be frighted at least with the
sight of the whip. Woe be to me, says Paul, if I preach not the Gospel, 1 Cor.
9.16. Or if, when I have preached to others, I my self should be a cast-a-way
verse 27. which to prevent, he kept under his body (his corruption) and gave it
a blue eye: for we are not debtors to the flesh, says he, Romans 8.10. We owe
nothing but stripes and menaces, cursing it in every cruse etc.

And if I be righteous, yet I will not lift up my head] Indeed I cannot,
because I am so bowed down with changes of sorrows, armies of afflictions: my
pains are continued, and I shall surely sink under them: much ado I have now
to keep head above water. Others make this a description of Jobs humility, I
will not lift up my head, viz. in pride, but humble my self to walk with my
God, as that poor publican did who stood afar off, and would not lift up so
much as his eyes to heaven, Luke 18.13.

I am full of confusion] Cast upon me by my friends, who reproach me for an
hypocrite, and make my cheeks glow. The fullness of an aspersion may possibly
put an innocent person to the blush: and it is the property of defamations to
leave a kind of lower estimation many times, even where they are not believed.
This was the confusion that Job complained of, the stomach of his mind was full
of it, even to satiety and surfeit.

Therefore see thou mine affliction] My pressing and piercing affliction, see
it and remedy it, as Psalm 119.153. Let not all my trouble seem little unto
thee, as Nehem. 9.32. See Lord, see, behold it is high time for thee to set in.

Verse 16. For it increaseth] Heb. For it lifts up it self: it even boyleth
up to the height, or it waxes proud, as the proud surges of the sea: Broughton
renders it, Oh haw it flees up! Why how? Surely, as a fierce lion, so it
hunteth me: it rises upon me, as a Lion rampant does upon his prey, or as a
Lion when he is pursued, gives not place, hides not his head, but comes into
the open fields as holding it a disgrace to withdraw, so some sense it: Or,

Thou huntest me as a fierce Lion] Tanquam ^e. God when he afflicts men, is
often compared to a Lion: or Tanquam leonem, as if I were a ravening Lion; so
thou huntest me, Isa. 38.13. Hos. 5.14. Hos. 13.7.
setting thy nets and toyls, making thy snares and pits ut capiar ad occisionem
(so the Septuagint) that I may be taken and destroyed, as 2 Pet. 2 12.

And again thou show thy self mavelous upon me] Heb. And thou returnest.
Here Job shows, says an Interpreter, what a confidence he had, that God
returning to him in mercy would do wonderfully for him in the end: the word
turning here, Ab. Ezr.
and the turning his captivity, chap. 42. so aptly answering the one to the
other to approve this exposition. But others understand it of the continued or
repeated acts of Jobs affliction una vi^e post aliam; as if he should say, thou
clappest on one affliction upon another: my pains know not only no period, but
no pause: thou layest upon me extraordinary sorrows, as if thou would declare
in me alone, quam mirus sis artifex, what an excellent artisan thou art when
thou please, and what thou can do against a poor creature: surely thou have
made my plagues wonderful, Deuteronomy. 28.59. So the Apostles were made a
gazing-stock, a theater, a spectacle of humane misery, 1 Cor. 4.9.

Verse 17. Thou renewest thy witnesses against me] These fresh witnesses were
devils say some; Jobs friends, say others, his dolorous sufferings rather,
says Austir, those open witnesses of some secret wickedness in Job, as the
world would esteem them. See chap. 16.8. Ruth 1.21. Thus the Jews censured our
Savior, Isa. 53.3, 4. The Barbarians Paul, Acts 28. and those in the Gospel
them that perished by the fall of the tower of Siloam. And how many precious
men as well as Job, have been cast upon this evidence for traitors and rebels
against the highest majesty? J^^u^ thinks, that when Job uttered the words of
this text, he felt some new pains growing upon him and increasing.

Thou in reasest thine indignation upon me] Or within me, as chap. 6.4. and
this was it that put a sting into his sufferings; Gods heavy displeasure seemed
to be kindled against him. Be not thou a terror unto me o Lord, said Jeremy,
and then I shall do well enough with the rest.

Changes and war (or armies) are upon me, or against me] Variety of troubles
come trooping and treading, as it were, on the heels of one another: fluctus
fluct^um ^rudi^: there is a continual succession of my sorrows, fresh forces
sent against me etc. We see then that Job complained not without cause, though
he kept not always within compass, as appears by that which follows.

Verse 18. Wherefore have thou brought me forth out of the womb?] Why? but was
not that a mercy? David esteemed it so, and gives God the glory, Psalm. 22.9.
But discontent is an utter enemy to thankfulness. The bird sings not till she
have taken up her stand to her mind. Some men's eyes are so bleared and glazed
with tears for what they want, that they cannot see what good they have, cannot
see mercies for blessings. Job here in a distemper wishes himself, (as he had
done before, chap. 3. Who can understand his errors? Psalm 19.12.) either
unborn, or presently dead, without the distance of one day betwixt his birth
and his burial. In quo errorem erravit non levem, vir alioqui pientissimus;
this was a worse wish then if he had desired that his life might be presently
taken away from him, for herein he shows himself unthankful to God for all
his former benefits: and not so only, but angry with God for the good he had
done him: thus we have seen dogs in a chafe fly at their masters, and children
in a pelt strike at their parents. But these were the voices of the flesh
lusting against the spirit, which afterward (being justly reprehended for
them, first by Elihu, and then also by God himself) he repressed and repented
of in dust and ashes, Psalm 42.6.

Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me] sc. with delight;
for what pleasure is there in seeing a dead corpse, especially a still-born
child? see Genesis 23.4. with the Note. This text teaches us, says an
Interpreter, what sad effects extreme grief and pain works in the very best:
it distempereth their spirits, and so disturbeth them, that their complaints
look like the blasphemies of the wicked, and they sometimes wish absurd things,
dishonorable to God, and prejudicial to themselves.

Verse 19. I should have been as though I had not been] Here he sings the same
song as chap. 3. and 6. It is hard to say how often a child of God may discover
the same infirmity. Our lives are fuller of sins then the firmament is of
stars, or the furnace of sparks.

I should have been carried from the womb to the grave] He makes mention of the
grave as a desirable place, which yet in the two last verses he describes as a
place of darkness and disorder. Thus Job himself was in the dark; and in his
passion he throws out words without wisdom; Itaque solicit orandus est
Dius, says one here, God is therefore to be earnestly entreated, that when we
are hard put to it with pain and misery, we may not give way to unruly passion,
nor suffer our tongues to out-lash, as they will be apt to do. See Psalm. 39.1.
confer Psalm. 22.77.88 and 89. and we shall see David well nigh as far out, as
Job in his complaints and wishes; but God can put a difference between the
godly and sin in them, as between poison and the box that holds it. He can
also pity them, as we do poison in a man, which yet we hate in a toad etc.

Verse 20. Are not my days few?] And oh that they might not be also evil! since
I shall not much trouble the world, oh that I might not find much trouble in
the world! What man is he that would fain see good days, says David, Psalm
34.12? What man is he that would not, says Austin in answer to him? Job and
David join in one and the same suit for a truce from trouble, since their time
here was so very short, Psalm 39.13. and 89.47.

Cease then, and let me alone] After he had vented his passions, he falls again
to his prayers. Ye have done all this wickedness (says Samuel to the people
who had been over-importunate for a King) yet turn not aside from following the
Lord etc. 1 Samuel 12.20. Whilst prayer stands still, the whole trade of
godliness stands still. Saints, though they have sinned, yet must not restrain
prayer, but go home to God again with shame in their faces, and tears in their
eyes, and he will speak peace; only they must be sensible that their Father
has spit in their faces etc.

That I may take comfort a little] A modest request: the poor man speaks
supplications, begs a farthing. They who are lowly, make low demands. Oh that I
were but a door keeper! oh that Ishmael might live in thy sight etc.

Verse 21. Before I go whence I shall not return] Before I go out of this
world, never more to return hither to enjoy the comforts that are here to be
had. Death is a departure hence, 1 Pet. 1.15. Luke 9.31. And so the Ancients (
Irenaeus, Clement, and others) used to call it: I shall change my place, but
not my company, said that dying Saint who had here walked with God in
uprightness, Tertul.
and was now to bid adieu to all worldly interests. The old Romans were wont to
say of a dead friend, Abiit, and eversurus est, He is gone, and will come
again. It seems hereby that they had some dark notions of a Resurrection;
whence also their Poets called a dead body, a soul; -- animamque sepulchro
condimus. The Hebrews did the like, Virg. Aeneid.
Numb. 5.2. and 9.10. and 19.11. Hag. 2.14. as having a more sure word of
Prophecy: and Job was clear in this point, firmly believing the resurrection
of his body, chap. 19.26, 27. It must needs be therefore that he speaks here of
not returning into this world. See the like chap. 16.22. Psalm 39.13. 2. Sam.
12.23.

Even to the land of darkness etc.] See the Note on verse 22.

Verse 22. ^^land of darkness etc.] This is not a description of hell, and of
the state of the damned (as some would have it) for Job never meant to come
there, no more then Jacob did, Genesis 37.35. and 42.38. But it is such an elegant
description of the grave, (...) exceeds the fantasy of Poets, and the
rhetoric of all heathen Orators. There is something like it in David's Psalms,
especially Psalm 88.11, 12. where the grave is called a place of perdition, a
land of forgetfulness, and of darkness, whereinto they who descend; praise
not God, Psalm 115.17. In respect of their bodies they do not, they cannot,
Isai. 38.18. Hell, indeed, is much more a land of darkness, as darkness it
self; it is that outer-darknesse; a darkness beyond a darkness, as the
dungeon is beyond the prison; and the pains of hell are the chains of
darkness. now death is ^e^^^a^binger to the wicked, and hence it is so
dreadful in the apprehension and approach of it, that men's hearts do even die
within them, as Nabals did, through fear of death; and they tremble thereat as
the trees of the wood, or leaves of the forest, with Ahaz, Isai. 7.2.
Darkness we know, is full of terror: the Egyptians were sorely a frighted by
their three days thick darkness, in so much as that none stirred off his
stool all that while, Exodus 10.23. and it was the more terrible, doubtless,
because they had no warning of it, as they had of other plagues. How often do men
chop into the chambers of death (their long-home the grave) all on the sudden,
as he that travelleth in the snow, may do over head and ears into a marle-pit?
Death of any sort, is unwelcome to nature, as being its slaughterman: but when
sudden, It is so much the more ghastly; and those that desperately dare death
to a duel, cannot look it in the face with blood in their cheeks: only to those
that are in Christ, the bitterness of death is past, the sting of it pulled
out, the property altered, as has been already noted. Christ, the Sun of
Righteousness, says a Learned Expositor here, lay in the grave, and has left
perpetual beams of light there for his purchased people. Mr. Caryl.
The way to the grave is very dark, but Christ has set up lights for us etc.

And of the shadow of death] The shadow is the dark part of the thing; so that
the shadow of death is the darkest side of death, death in its most hideous and
horrid representations: the shadow of death is the substance of death, or death
with addition of greatest deadliness.

Without any order] Heb. and not orders, What then? confusion surely, without
keeping to rules or ranks: men's bones are mingled in the grave; whether they
have been princes or peasants, it cannot be discerned: Omnia mors aequat; as
chesse-men are put up all together in the bag when the game is ended, without
distinction of King, Duke, Bishop. etc. so here: Junius renders it, expertem
vicissitudinum, without any interchanges, distinctions, vicissitudes, or
varieties (as of day, night, summer, winter, heat, cold, etc.) of which things
consists the greatest part of the brevity of this world.

And where the light is (...) darknesse] How great then must needs be that
darkness? as our Savior speaks in another case, Matthew. 6.23. Surely when by
the return of the Sun; there is light in the land of the living; in the grave
all is abyssed and sunk into eternal might: as the bodies of those two
smothered Princes were by their cruel Uncle Richard the third, in the
black-deeps, a place so called at the Thames-mouth: in the grave light and
darkness are both alike: and as the Images in Popish Temples see nothing,
though great wax candles be lighted up before them: so the clearest light of
the Sun shining in his strength would be nothing to those that are dead and
buried. Let this be much and often thought on: mors tu^, mors Christi etc.
Cyrus that great Conqueror lying on his deathbed, praised God, says Xenophon,
that his prosperity had not puffed him up; for he ever considered that he was
but mortal, and must bid adieu to the world. Charles the fifth Emperor of
Germany caused his sepulcher and grave clothes to be made five years before his
death, and carried them closely with him whithersoever he went. Samuel sent
Saul newly anointed to Rachels sepulcher, 1 Samuel 10.24. that he might not
surfeit upon his new honors, etc.

CHAP. XI. Verse 1. Then answered Zophar the Naamathite.
WIth a most bitter invective, savouring more of passion, then charity; Zophar
rejoyneth, or rather revileth innocent Job, mis-interpreting his meaning, verse
4. and laying to his charge, 1. Loquacity or talkativenesse. 2. Lying. 3.
Scoffing at Gods good providence, and men's good counsel. 4. Self-conceitednesse
and arrogance, besides rashness, boldness, etc. For want of better arguments
against him, he falls foul upon him in this sort. And if the adversaries of the
truth do the like by us (as our Savior says they will, Matthew. 5.11. and as
himself, after Job and many other of his members, had the experience of it) we
must not be over-troubled. Zophar signifies a watcher, he watched for Jobs
halting, and took him up before he was down: he is styled the Naamathite from
Naamah (a city in the land of Vz, eighteen miles from Jobs Pyramid, says
Adricomius) which signifies ^air. But he deals not so fair with his friend,
as had been fit, for he gives him no honor or respect at all, but treats
him with singular sharpness and violence, or rather virulence of speech: hear
himself.

Verse 2. Should not the multitude of words be answered] Should not he who
speaks what he will, Nunquid qui multa loquitur, non and audiet? Vulg.
hear what he would not? yes, Job shall now, or you will want of your will: but if
Job have talked more then his part came to (the truth is, his speeches are
longer then any of those his three friends, which are all, except that first
made by Eliphaz, chap. 4. and 5. comprehended in one chapter, whereas his take
up two, three, or more) he may well be excused, considering the sharpness of
his disease, the ungentlenesse of his friends, and the sense of Gods
displeasure, which his soul labored under. Zophar and the rest looked upon him
as a wretched hypocrite, and were angry that he would not yield himself so;
they accused his former conversation as wicked; what way had he therefore to
defend and assert his own integrity, but by words? and must he yet pass for a
prattling fellow, a man of lips, a very wordy man, one that loves to hear
himself talk, because he will not be by them out-talked, and overborn by their
false charges? Most sure it is, that profane and profuse babblings are to be
avoided, and to bring fullness of matter in fewness of words, it is very
commendable. Quam multa quam paucis! said Tully of Bru^^s his Laconical
Epistle; how much is here in a little! but 1. Every man cannot be a
short-spoken Spartan: It is reported that in Luthers house was found written,
Melancthou has both matter and words: Luther has matter, but wants words;
Erasmus has words at will, but wants matter. Every one has his own share: all
are not alike-gifted. 2. He is to be accounted talkative, who utters
unprofitable words, and far from the purpose, beside the point: and so Zophar
himself was to be blamed in this whole discourse of his, wherein he talks
much, but speaks little. Concerning the infinite and unsearchable wisdom of
God, he argues truly and gravely, but yet nothing fitly to convince Job, who
himself had said as much and more of the same subject. The counsel also that
therehence he gives Job, does little or nothing concern him: it being the same
in effect that Eliphaz and Bildad had said before him: Zophar therefore was the
locutuleius, the talkative man here mentioned, rather then Job, the lip^-man,
adversus sua ipsius vitia facundus satis: and as Bion was wont to say, that the
Grammarians of his time could discourse well of the errors of Ulysses, but not
at all see their own; so it befell Zophar.

And should a man full of talk be justified?] Heb. a man of lips, so called, as
if he were made all of lips, and had no other members. Shall such an one be
ever a whit the better thought of? Not among wise men surely, what ever he may
amongst his fellow fools: for in multiloquio stultiloquium: Some gravel and mud
passes away with much water; some vanity with much talk: it is no wisdom for
a man to lay on more words then the matter will well bear. A good Orator, says
Plutarch, will see that his words and his matter be matches. And Hesiod says,
that words, as a precious treasure, should be thriftily husbanded, and warily
wasted: especially since an account is to be rendered, as our Savior assures
us, Matthew. 12.36. yea, by thy words (he says not, for thy words) thou shall be
justified, and by thy words (if superfluous and sinful, wast and wicked) thou
shall be condemned, verse 37.

Verse. 3. Should thy lies make men hold their peace?] Or, Thy toys, toilsome
toys, hammered in thine own head, hatched in thine own heart, which is
deceitful above all things, and so a fit shop to frame lies in: but should we
be silent at the hearing of them, and so become guilty of thy sin by a tacit
consent? Can any mortal wight hear what thou have said in behalf of thine own
imaginary innocence? chap. 6.29, 30. And how bold an appeal thou have made to
God as a witness thereof chap. 10.7. and not reply upon thee, and reprove
thee? The truth is, had Job been a liar, as Zophar would make of him, (even
mendaciorum loquacissimum, as Tertullian says of Tacitus, one that fearing his
many words would not carry his cause, had intermixed diverse untruths the better
to grace the business) he ought not to have been forborne by Zophar or any
else, that wished well to his soul: But it was far from good Job to be guilty
of this foul sin, so hated of God, so like the devil, so inconsistent with
religion. Christianus est, non mentietur, he is a Christian, you may be sure he
will not lie, was the old argument; he will rather die then lie; Davia indeed
in a distress, roundly told two or three lies together to Abimelech the
high priest, who suspected that he fled as a proscribed person 1 Samuel 21.2, 8.
So 1 Samuel 27.10. But that he allowed not this sin in himself it appears in
that 1. He had chosen the way of truth, his election was truth Psalm 119.30.
And 2. He prayed against the contrary evil, Remove from me the way of lying,
Psalm 119.29. He was not one of those that took fast hold of deceit, as
Jeremiah phraseth it chap. 8.5. Much less was Job; however Zophar was mistaken
in him, as he was much more in his next charge, wherein he makes him a scoffer
of God and good people.

And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?] Job is made a mocker
here; yea, a scorner, and derider, as the word signifies, such as David
describes, Psalm 22.6. and the Author to the Hebrews, chap. 11.36. where he
speaks of cruel mockings, such as the Scripture every where (but especially in
the Proverbs) brandeth for the worst sort of sinners: See Psalm 1.1. where the
Septuagint translate for scorners, (...).
Pests: as elsewhere Incorrigible, Prove. 21.1. Naught, Prove. 9.12. Proud, Prove.
3.34. Workers of iniquity Psalm 119.51. But where did Job mock in Zophars
judgment? First, he spoke contemptuously (as he thought) of God, as chap. 10.3.
Is it good unto thee that thou should oppress? etc. And whereas he spoke
better sometimes of Gods wisdom and righteousness, Zophar thought it was but
from the teeth-outward: but poor Job had little lift or leisure to mock and
jear: next, he mocked his friends for saying that he was justly afflicted;
saying, that they were cold comforters, void of Gods fear, merciless men etc.
This they took in very ill part, and Zophar thinks to make him ashamed of it:
for says he,

Shall no man make thee ashamed?] sc. By refuting thee, and by bringing thee to
a due sight of thine error: this good office he that shall undertake to do for
another, must be sure that he be able to do it effectually, else better not to
attempt it. When Carolostadius opposed Luthers Consubstantiation but weakly and
insufficiently, Zuinglius said, Non satis humerorum haberet.
he was sorry, that so good a cause wanted shoulders.

Verse. 4. For thou have said.] Thou have confidently affirmed; and this he
makes to be a loud lie, and not an idle word only. But where and when had Job
said it? Did not Zophar openly play the Sophister, so interpreting what Job had
spoken chap. 6.10. and 9.22. and 10.7. in defense of his innocence, as if Job
had maintained that he was free from all sin; whereas notwithstanding, he had
very often witnessed and confessed himself to be a sinner, insomuch, as that
albeit he were without sin, yet he could not be accounted clear and pure in the
sight of God? But Zophar took these for good words only, and was therefore so
sharp-set against him. So Cyril and Theodoret mistook one another, and objected
heresy mutually: when as afterward it appeared, that they were both of one
judgment. Charity would have taught Zophar to have taken Job in a better sense,
and to have said of him as Cruciger did of Luther, eum commodius sentire quam
loquitur, dum effervescit, that he held right, though in his heat he spoke not
so fitly as might be wished; good men's words are reverenter glossanda (as one
said of the Laws) to have a reverent gloss put upon them, and not by a
spiritual unmannerlinesse, to be taken with the left hand; when they might and
ought to be taken with the right.

My doctrine is pure] Clear as crystal, transparent as a crystal glass with
a light in the midst; you may see through it, and find no flaw or filth in it:
Job was no professed preacher, yet he had not concealed the words of the Holy
One, chap. 6.10. As he had received the knowledge of the truth from parents and
teachers (the word here rendered doctrine, comes from a root that signifies to
receive) so he had freely and purely imparted it to others, commending it unto
them as sound and sincere, and therefore well worthy of all acceptance. But
that which troubled Zophar and his two fellows was, that Job should affirm that
God did afflict good men in this world as heavily as bad men, which yet was an
irrefragable truth, such as Job resolved to live and die in.

And I am clean in thine eyes] i. e. I am not sinlesse, but sincere and
upright, no hypocrite (as you have charged me) no worker of iniquity, but one
that would be cleansed from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and do by the
daily practice of mortification, purify my self as God is pure: more then this
Job said not, though Zophar thought he did, and therefore wishes in the next
words that God himself would convince him of his error.

Verse 5. But oh that God would speak etc.] For we do but lose our sweet words
upon thee, since thou art set, and so wedded and wedged to thine own will and
way, that thou can not be removed and rectified, but by an extraordinary
touch from the hand of heaven; O therefore that God would speak and open his
lips against thee, and for us: for so Zophar doubts not but he would do; but if
it proved otherwise chap. 42. Job was justified, and these three condemned,
because they had not spoken of God, (or to God, as in this text) the thing that
was right, verse 7. but had been Satan's instruments to discourage Job^ and to
drive that good man to many passionate speeches. Some men (and women too, as
Sarah, Genesis 16.5.) are overhasty to send for God, as it were, by a post, to
decide their controversies: who, if he should come at their call, would
certainly pronounce against them. Psalm. 37. Eccles. 5.2.
Fret not thy self therefore to do evil: be not rash with thy mouth, and let
not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing in this kind before God, or to
interest him in thy quarrels and controversies, for he will surely pass an
impartial sentence, neither is there any iniquity with the Lord our God, nor
respecting of persons, nor rec^iving of gifts, 1 Chronicles. 19.7. One Interpreter
from this wish of Zophar notes, that it is an ordinary practice of heretics
(Satan's factors) to mention God, as approving of their errors, if by speaking
he would from heaven declare himself plainly; and that therefore we should take
heed of those that labor to work upon us this way, when by right reason they
are able to evince nothing that they say.

Verse. 6. And that he would show thee the secrets of wisedome] This may be
understood of Gods law (says Diodate) or of the hidden ways of his
providence; which if God would show Job, he should at once see that he mistook
much, and knew little of those many mysteries that are both in the word and
works of God, in all divine dispensations, which are such as none can unriddle
but God himself; neither can we see them till he show them. It is well
observed, that the word here rendered [shew] signifies to interpret and expound
that which is dark, mysterious and enigmatical; and till God show us in this
sort, we remain ignorant both in the book of the creatures, and in the book of
the Scriptures. Oh pray that ye may be all taught of God, that he would show
you great and mighty things which you know not, Jer 33.3. that he would so open
your eyes, that ye may behold wondrous things out of his Law, Psalm 119.18. etc.

That they are double to that which is] Sunt enim Deo judiciorum duo genera, so
the Tigurines translate the words, for God has judgments of two several sorts,
viz. open and secret, such as thou with all thy skill can not dive into. The
Hebrew is, dovbles to the being; that is, says one, manifold more then is by
thee apprehended; and although God has afflicted thee according to what he
has revealed, yet he might afflict thee more, if he should proceed according
to the height of his secret wisdom: thy plagues should be double to that
which is, if God should deal rigorously with thee: there is reason therefore
thou should be patient, since thy sins are far more then thy sufferings.

Know then that God exacteth of thee less then thine iniquity deserveth] This
is a meditation that may be of special use, as to humble us, so to stanch
murmuring, and to strengthen patience under present pressures. See Ezra 9.13.
with the Note. Junius renders it acknowledge at least that God exacteth
somewhat of thee for thine iniquity: somewhat it is, and but somewhat, since
hell is the just hire of the least sin, and it is the Lords mercy that we are
not consumed Lament. 3.22.

Verse 7. Can thou by searching find out God?] i. e. The nature of God, or
the course of his providence, and the reason of his proceedings? thou can
never do it: Neither did Job ever take upon him to do it, but had excellently
and accurately set out the same things chap. 9.4. etc. that Zophar here does;
so that he might well have spared his pains in this discourse as to Job; but
that being too pertinacious in his evil opinion of him, he chose rather to
thwart him, then to close with him, as contentious people use to do.

Can thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?] No nor the brightest Angel
in heaven, the highest graduate in glory. Find him we may possibly, but not
find him out, much less find him out to perfection. Tantum recedit, quantum
capitur, Orat. 1.
says Nazianzen. The nearer you draw unto God, the further off he is from you,
De mirabil. auscult.
and you are as much to seek as ever: he is indeed like the pool Polycritus
writes of (cited by Aristotle) which in compass at the first scarce seemed to
exceed the breadth of a shield, but if any went in to wash, it extended it self
more and more. A Country fellow thinks, if he were upon such a mountain, he
could touch heaven, and take a star in his hand; but when he comes thither,
heaven is as far off as it was etc. So it is here; eye has not seen, nor ear
heard etc. 1 Cor. 2.9. Chrysostom speaking of Gods love in Christ, says, I am
like a man digging in a deep spring: I stand here, and the water rises up upon
me, and I stand there, and still the water rises upon me. What the Apostle
says of this infinite love of God, that it passes knowledge, as having all
the dimensions Ephesians. 3.18, 19. the same is true of the wisdom of God, as
Zophar sets forth in the following verses.

Verse 8. It is as high as heaven, what can thou do?] And much higher; it is
as the highnesses of heaven (so the Hebrew has it) which is so high, that one
would wonder we should be able to behold the starry sky (which yet is but as
the marble wall round about the palace) and the very eye not be tired in the
way. See the Note on Prove 25.3. How high that second heaven is, may hereby be
gathered, in that the stars (whereof those of the first magnitude are said to
be every one above 107. times as big again as the whole earth) do yet seem to
us but as so many small sparks or spangles: but how high the third heaven is
above them, cannot be conjectured Ephesians 4.10. And yet the wisdom of the
Almighty is far above that. But what means Zophar by these cutted questions
of his, What can thou do? and what can thou know? He thought belike, that
either Job considered not what he had said, when he so set forth Gods wisdom,
and his own shallowness: or else that he contradicted himself, when he
nevertheless stood so much upon his own integrity, and complained so greatly of
his misery, as of an injury

Deeper then hell] Which wherever it is, appears by this and other texts of
Scripture, as Revel. 14.11. Deuteronomy. 32.22. Psalm 55.15. Prove. 15.24. etc. To be
(...), Vbi sit, se^tient, qui curi^sius quae^^nt, says one; where it is, they
shall find one day, who ever curiously enquire. The word here rendered hell;
signifies the lower and more remote parts of the earth: and David tells us,
that the wicked shall be turned into hell, into the lowest part of it, as the
He licale there implies Psalm 9 17.

Verse 9. The measure thereof is longer then the earth:] Wherein, some
kingdoms are of a very great length, as those of the Turks, and of the Tartars
at this day. How long then in the earth it self? Some have undertaken to tell
in how many days a nimble footman might measure it, but that is but a
conjecture. It must be remembered, that these things are spoken after the manner
of men; for the wisdom of God can neither be measured nor numbered: of his
understanding there is no number, says the Prophet, Psalm 147.5. Archimedes
the Mathematician vaunted, that he by his skill in Arithmetic, could number up
all the sand or dust that is in the whole world habitable and inhabitable. But
who can cast up the extent of the Divine wisdom.

And broader then the sea] Which yet David calls the great and wide sea,
Psalm 104.25. Breadth is ascribed to the sea, because of its huge extension,
mariners for many days together whiles they sail upon the main, see no land,
but only sky and water. Gods wisdom goes beyond all these: neither must we
think to lade this Ocean with our cockle-shell. We may sooner drain the sea
with a spoon; then the perfections of God with our largest understandings.

Verse 10. If he cut off and shut up] Heb. If he change, viz. his course or way
of proceedings toward men, either to shut them up close prisoners, or otherwise
to put them to such straits that ( Job-like) they know not what to do, or which
way to turn themselves.

Or gather together] viz. His witnesses, say some, against an offender, his
armies and military forces, says the Chaldee paraphrast, to ruin his enemies:
his outcasts, say some interpreters, according to that Psalm 147.2. The Lord
does build up Jerusalem, he gathers together the outcasts of Israel. If he
do any or all of these to show his sovereignty, as well he may;

Then who can hinder him] Heb. turn him away, or put a stop to him? If God
should do and undo, confound all things, turn the world upside down, who shall
contradict him or question him? May he not do with his own as he pleases?
Atqui non erat necesse haec a Zophar dici, quum de his jam and eadem dixisset
Job. Merc.
And might not Zophar have spared thus to have spoken to Job; since Job had said
the same to him in effect before? But Zophars design was to prove hereby that
he who is by God brought into straits, is a wicked liver. He therefore in the
two following verses glanceth at him as vain, wicked, brutish, and not unlike
to a wild asse-colt, such as God would surely tame and tutor to better things
by afflictions, and so bring him to hand.

Verse 11. He knows vain man, he sees wickedness also] Doubtless he
beholds faithless men, mortals of vanity, headlong and headstrong wights;
homines falsitatis (so Cajetan renders it) men of false-hood; homines mendaces
(so Pagnine) lying persons, such as thou Job art presumed to be by thy impious
words, and grievous punishments: He sees wickedness, inanitatem and
iniquitatem, vanity and villainy: God sees all, how closely and cleanly soever
hypocrites think to carry the matter; first, hiding God from themselves, and
then vainly hoping to hide themselves also from God; but his eyes behold, his
eyelids try the children of men; Psalm 11.4. He sees their wickedness or
unreasonableness (as the word properly signifies) for wicked men are absurd
men, 2 These. 3.2. they are compact of mere incongruities, solecizing in
opinion, speeches, actions, all.

Will he not then consider it?] sc. To judge and punish it? Man makes no great
matter of sin, but God does. He will bring every work into judgment, with every
secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil, Eccles. 12.14. he will
see that every transgression and disobedience shall receive a just recompense
of reward, Heb. 2.2. This Zophar does not only affirm, but puts i^ home
strongly by a question (wherein he closely taxes Job of hypocrisy) Will he
not consider it? Some read it without a question thus, But he (that is man)
considers not, is without understanding of Gods wisdom and justice, being
dull and stupid like a wild asse-colt, as it follows.

Verse 12. For vain man would be wise] Heb. Hollow man, that is, as void of
grace, as an hollow tree is of heart of oak. Would be wise.] Heb. would be
hearty, ^gregie cordatus home, there is an elegancy in the Original that cannot
be Englished. Will thou know, O vain man, (...).
says St. James chap. 2.20. The Greek is, thou empty man, thou that have
nothing in thee, and yet art highly conceited: thou that art ( Ephraim-like) a
silly dove without an heart, Hos. 7.11. and yet in superbiam erect^^ (as the
Vulgar here has it) raised up to pride: that little knowledge he has, puffs
him up, 1 Cor. 8.1. So hollows-like is the natural soul, or rather so
bladder-like, like, that filled with earthly vanities, it grows great, and
swells in pride: but pricked with the least pin of piercing grief, it
shriveleth to nothing. The Prophet Isaiah fitly compares it to a bul-rush,
chap. 58.5. the color whereof is fresh, the skin smooth: but if you pill it,
what is under but a kind of spongious, unsubstantial substance, of no use in
the world worth the speaking of? Formallists and pretenders to holiness, are
flat nothing, worse then nothing, iniquity, Matthew. 23.28.

Though man he born as a wild asses colt] Take him in his pure naturals, he is
no wiser; Ephesians. 4.
created he was in Gods image, which consisted in knowledge, righteousness and
holiness: knowledge in his understanding, rightnesse or straightness in his
will, and holiness in his affections. But since the fall, all this is lost and
gone quite: he has principium laesum, neither can he know the things of God,
no though he be (...), a souly man, one that does excolere animam, such as
Tully and Aristotle: yet is he in spirituals, as blind as a beetle, a mere
asse-colt: a colt is none of the wisest creature, much less an asse-colt,
least of all a wild asse-colt; and yet such is man, sensual man, Judge. 19.
saplesse man, Psalm 14.1. he is as an asses foale for rudeness, a wild asses
for unrulinesse, untamed, and untractable. Surely, as a wild asse-colt, (says
Gregory upon this text) not used to the yoke, runs up and down the large
fields and woods at his pleasure, and when he is weary, lies down, and thus
does from day to day: So man by nature is licentious, running as his lusts
carry him, to all manner of sin, and gives not overrunning till he is weary:
he will not be held in by any reins, or kept to do the work he should by any
yoke which the Lord by teaching seeks to put upon him. Surely (says another)
God is fain to deal with such, Marbury.
as men do with frisking jades in a pasture, that cannot take them up, till
they get them to a gate: Theatr. hist. page 127.128.
so till the hour of death etc. Thomas Blaverus chief counselor sometime to
the King of Scots, believed not that there was God or devil, heaven or hell,
till he came to die, and then cried out, he was damned: so also died one Arthur
Miller: Sword against swear. page 34. Hist. of world.
and before him, a desperate Dean of Paul's. When death comes (says Sir Walter
Raleigh) which hates and destroys men, that is believed. But God that loves
and makes men, he is not regarded. O eloquent death! O mighty death! whom none
could advise, thou art able to persuade etc.

Verse 13. If thou prepare thine heart] viz. to meet God, Amos 4.12. humbly
submitting to his justice, and heartily imploring his mercy. The sum of what
Zophar says in the following verses, is this; if thou truly repent, thou
shall prosper: as if not, thou shall perish: this he might have said more fitly
to most of us, who are deeply guilty (says Lavater) then to Job, who was
nothing so sinful as we are, and yet much more penitent. But Zophar calls upon
him to quarrel with his faults, and not with his friends, and to break off his
sins by repentance; without which, if he should have peace, it would be but
like those short interims between the Egyptian plagues.

And stretch out thine hands toward him] Heb. And spread thy palms to him: so
in prayer for pardon of sin, and power against sin: for this stretching out, or
spreading of the hands, is a prayer-gesture, wherein Gods people come forma
pauperis, holding out the hand to receive mercy, as beggars do an alms: or as
men beg quarter for their lives with hands held up: or lastly, as he that is
fallen into a ditch, or deep pit, and cannot get out, lifts up his hands, and
cries out for help. See Exodus 17.11, 12. and 19.29. 1 Kings 8.22. Psalm 141.2.
It appears that the Ancients prayed not with their hands joined together, or
a little way lifted up, but with their arms stretched abroad, and the palms of
their hands turned up toward heaven.

Verse 14. If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away] Cast away all thy
transgressions, and throw thy lusts out of service. Hands lifted up in prayer
must be pure, 1 Timothy 2.8. for the fountain of goodness will not be laden at
with foul hands Isai. 1.15, 16. Good therefore is the counsel of Jeremiah,
chap. 4.14. and of St. James, chap. 4.8. The Priests had their laver to wash in
before they sacrificed, and their brazen altar to offer on before they burnt
incense. He that comes to pray, having not first purged himself of all
filthiness of flesh and spirit, does (say the Jew-doctors) as he that comes
to offer a clean beast, but holds an unclean one in his hand. By iniquity in
the hand here, Beza and others understand wrong-dealing, either by fraud or
force, by strength or slight of hand: and then Zophar presses Job to
restitution: away with it, says he, send it home to the right owner: else you
will cough in hell, and the devils will laugh at you, says Latimer.

And let not wickedness dwell in thy Tabernacles] i. e. In thy family, Josh.
24.15. ^sth. 4.16.
and wherever else thou have to do; I and my house will serve the Lord, says
Joshuah: I and my maids, says Esther. David's care for the reforming and
well-ordering of his household, and of his whole kingdom, See Psalm 101.
throughout. Such a man is really as he is relatively. Those Governors of
families and countries show themselves perfect strangers to the practice of
repentance, who make no other use of their servants and subjects, then they do
of their beasts; whiles they may have their bodies to do their service, they
care not if their souls serve the devil. This will lie heavy one day.

Verse 15. For then shall thou lift up thy face without spot etc.] Repentance
must be performed in faith, or else it will prove to be poenitentia
Iscariotica, a Judas-like repentance. Lord (said that dying Saint) cast me down
as low as hell in repentance, and lift me up by faith into the highest heavens
in confidence of thy salvation. Zophar, that he may move Job kindly and rightly
to repent, promises him thereupon malorum ademptionem, bonorum adeptionem,
freedom from evil, and fruition of good. And first, thou shall lift up thy
face without spot, i. e. Thou shall be full of comfort and of confidence, not
casting down thy countenance, as guilty Cain but looking up boldly and
cheerfully, as St. Steven did, Acts 7.15. they saw his face as it had been the
face of an Angel.

Ibat ovans animis and spe sua damna levabat. Yea, thou shall be stedfast] Or
durable and compact as a molten pillar; thine heart shall be established with
grace, thy mind with peace: thine outward estate with a lasting felicity.

And shall not fear] sc. The loss of those enjoyments. To be freed from the
fear of evil, is better then to be freed from evil: and a great part of the
Saints portion both on earth and in heaven, lies in their deliverance from
fear, Luke 1.74. Psalm 112.7. See Zepb. 3.13. Isa. 17.2. Repent, and thou shall
fear no more a revolution of any thy troubles.

Verse 16. Because thou shall forget thy misery] There being no fear left, or
foot step thereof remaining to renew thy grief, Genesis 41.30. Remember thy former
trouble thou shall, with thankfulness for a better condition now, but no
otherwise: all the marks of former affliction shall be worn out. See Isa.
65.16.13. so that thou shall discount all the evil thou have endured.

And remember it as waters that pass away] As a land-flood, soon gone, as a
light cloud quickly over: or as Noah's flood which that good man thought upon:
when it was past, with thankfulness to God, offering sacrifice for his safety.
So shall thou Job: and as a man seldom thinks how much water passes by his
habitation by day and by night; or if he do; yet its no trouble to his mind, no
more shall the remembrance of bypast miseries be to thine.

Verse 17. And thine age shall be clearer then the noon-day] The rest of thy
life which thou give for lost, shall be the very prime part of thy time for
glory. Solid glory springs out of innocence of life, beneficence toward all
men, acts done valiantly and succesfully with justice and moderation of mind:
whereunto is added the constant applause of good men, proceeding from an
admiration of so great virtue. This Zophar promises Job upon his true
repentance, with a daily increase thereof, as the Sun shines more and more
unto the perfect day. Fame follows virtue, as the shadow does the body at the
very heels. If there be any virtue, if any praise, says the Apostle Philip.
4.8. Where the one is, the other will be. Abel for his faith and righteousness
is yet spoken of (as some render Hebr. 11.4.) though dead long ago. The
Righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance, Psalm 112.6.

Thou shall shine forth, thou shall be as the morning] Isai. 58.8. Or, If thou
do wax obscure, yet thou shall match the morning which disperseth darkness,
and conquers it by the approaching light. Look how the Moon wadeth out of a
cloud, so shall thine over-cast righteousness break, forth as the light, and
thy judgment as the noonday, Psalm 37.6.

Verse 18. And thou shall be secure, because there is hope] It Is a spiritual
security that is here promised, which is a fruit of faith, quelling and killing
distracting and distrustful fears; faith, I say, unfaigned 1 Timothy 1.5. which
produces hope unfailable Romans 5.5. Hope is the daughter of faith, but such as
is a staff to her aged mother.

Yea, thou shall dig about thee] That is (says one Interpreter) by searching
to find out how to do all things for the best, thou shall prosper in all.
Others sense it thus, Eugub. Tigur.
thou shall be secure as they that lie in trenches. Rabbi David, Thou shall dig
only about thy city, and not need to make any walls about it for thy security.
Others, Lavater.
thou shall labor hard, and sleep soundly thereupon. Or thus, God shall so
encompasse thee with his safe protection, as if thou do but dig a place to
pitch thy tent in, thou shall enjoy thy self safelier therein then otherwise
thou would do in a walled city.

And thou shall take thy rest] God will keep off those gnats of cares and
fears, that might disquiet thee. We read of some great Princes that could not
sleep; as Ahasuerus Esth. 6.1. Daniel Thulin.
Richard the third of England; and Charles the ninth of Franc, after that
barbarous Massacre at Paris: but David could Psalm 3. and 4. because God was
his keeper. No marvel that Philip sleeps soundly, when Antipater (his fast
friend) watched by him the while. Job and all Gods beloved ones shall sleep on
both ears, Psalm 127.2. rest securely and comfortably. What should hinder, In
utramvis aurem.
when the keeper of Israel, who neither slumbreth nor sleeps, shall watch
over them for good?

Verse 19. Thou shall lie down, and none shall make thee afraid] Thou shall
walk about the world like a conqueror, being ever under a double guard, the
Peace of God within thee, Philip. 4.7. and the Power of God without thee 1 Pet.
1.5. neither shall any enemy come upon thee in the night to fright and to
disturb thee, which is a great mercy. It is not long since we of this Nation
did eat the bread of our souls in peril of our lives, neither could we rest in
our beds for the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war: Destruction upon
destruction was cried etc. Jer. 4.19, 20. Should this ever be forgotten?

Yea, many shall make suit unto thee] Heb. Shall entreat thy face: yea, they
shall tire thee out with their entreaties. Many seek the Rulers favor, Prove.
29.26. he is even thronged with suitors, so that he cannot be without a Master
of Requests. Hence the Poet Orpheus faineth that Litae or Supplications and
Petitions are Joves daughters: (...) Orph. in Arg.
and that they are ever attending at his throne. Here then Zophar promises
Job, that upon his return to God he shall be as great a man as ever; and that
many, yea, that his very enemies shall not only not molest him, but fear his
power, Jer. 30.17.
and beg his favor. And whereas once it was, this is Job whom no man feeketh,
after, then the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor, Psalm 45.12.
and all that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the foals of thy seet,
Isai 60.14. See Isai 45.14. Rev. 3.9. Prove. 19.6. Lo this is the honor God
puts upon holiness, Holy and reverend is his name; and therefore reverend
because holy: so also is ours, Psalm 111.9.
Isai. 43.4. Howbeit we have cause to complain, that in these last and worst
times, Omnes quodammodo mali esse coguntur, ne viles habeantur. Sal. lib 4.
as the Turks count all fools to be Saints, so men with us account all Saints
to be fools; and not a few turn to unholinesse, lest they should be despised.

Verse 20. But the eyes of the wicked shall fail] Contraries illustrate one
another: and Zophar willing his words should stick and work, thinks to leave a
sting in Jobs mind by telling him what he must trust to if he persist in his
sin. And first, his eyes shall sail: Vt vehementius vellicet and fodiat
inopinatum, ut putabat Job^ animum. Merl. Speed.
The eye is a principal part of the body: and the failing of the eyes follows
either upon some sudden fright, or upon much weeping, Damen. 2. Psalm 88. and
38. (we read of one Faustus son of Vortiger King of Britain, who wept out his
eyes) or too long looking after the same thing, or on the same object. The
wicked, says Zophar, shall never want frights and griefs; they shall also look
many a long look after help, but none shall appear Lam. 4.17. their hopes shall
be fruitless their projects successelesse.

And they shall not escape] Heb. refuge or flight shall perish from them
miseries and mischiefs they shall never be able to avert or avoid; many sorrows
shall be to the wicked Psalm 32.10. and although they may think to get off, of
outrun them, yet it will not be, Amos 2.14. Psalm 142.4. Saul for instance.
God has forsaken me, says he, and the Philistims are upon me, 1 Samuel 28.15.

Their hope shall be as the giving up of the Ghost] Broughton renders it,
Their hope is naught but pangs of the soul. Of that which yeildeth but cold
comfort, we use to say, It comfort a man like the pangs of death: the Vulgar
has it, Their hope shall be the abomination of their soul: the Tigurine, Their
hope shall be most vain, even as a puff of breath which presently passes
away, and comes to nothing. Some Rabbines make this the sense, Their hope
shall be as the snuffing of the breath: that is, they shall be so angry at
their disappointments, that they shall vex and snuff at it. According to our
translation, the wicked man's hope is set forth as utterly forlorn, and at an
end for any good ever to befall him. The godly man's hope is lively, 1 Pet. 1.3.
and the righteous has hope in his death, Prove. 14.32. Cum expiro spero is his
motto: whereas the wickeds word when he dies is, or may be, spes and fortuna
valete, my life and hope ends together; Spes eorum expiratione animae, so
Tremellius renders the text: Death causes in the wicked a total despair, and
a most dreadful schreek gives the guilty soul, when it sees it self launching
into an infinite ocean of scalding lead, and considers that therein it must
swim naked for ever.

CHAP. XII. Verse 1. And Job answered and said]
BEing nipped and netled with his friends hard usage of him, and harsh language
to him, but especially with Zophars arrogant and lofty preface in the former
chapter, he begins now to wax warm, and more roughly and roundly to shape them
an answer.

Verse 3. No doubt but ye are the people] The select peculiar people, the only
Ones, as a man is put for a good man, Jer. 5.1. a wife for a good wife, Prove.
18.22. a name for a good name Eccles. 7.1. As Athens was said to be the Greece
of Greece, Silius.
and as one promising to show his friend all Athens at once, showed him Solo^^
or as the Latin Poet, saying of Fabius Maximus.

Hic patriuest, murique urbis stant pectore in uno. So says Job by an holy
jear (not to disgrace his friends, but to bring them to more modesty and
moderation, if it might be) Certes, ye are not one or two men, Vatab.
but specimen totius orbis, an Epitome of the world, or at least the
Representative of some whole people: ye have got away all the wit from my self
and others, whom ye look upon as so many wild asses colts in comparison of
your selves. Thus the Pope ( Simon Magus-like) gives himself out to be some
great thing, Acts 8.9. even the Church-virtual and that in his breast, as in
Noah's Ark, is comprehended all wisdom and worth: ye know nothing at all,
says he ( Caiaphas-like) to all others, Job. 11.49. So do his Janissaries, the
Jesuits, who will needs be taken for the only Scholars, Politicians, and
Orators of the world. The Church, say they, is the soul of the world, the
Clergy of the Church; and we of the Clergy: the Empire of learning is ours etc.

And wisdom shall dye with you] As being looked up in your bosoms. Suetonius
tells us of Palaemon the Grammarian, that he was heard to say, that Learning
was born with him, and would dye with him. The Gnostics would needs be held
the only knowing men: Illuminates in Spain the only spiritual men:
Swe^kfeldians in Germany styled themselves the Confessors of the glory of
Christ: our Antinomians the Hearers of the Gospel, and of free-grade. But what
says Solomon? Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth, Prove.
27.2. And that which had been much to a man's commendation, if from another,
sounds very slenderly from himself, says Pliny. Aben Ez^^, and Rabbi Levi
set another sense upon this verse, Ep. 8. lib. 1.
as if it were no (...), but a plain assertion to this effect: Questionless
you are to be counted (...) the common sort of people (see John 7.49.) Neither
is there in you any thing excellent or extraordinary, that ye should be looked
upon, as drained from the dregs, or sifted from the brans of the very vulgar:
your wisdom, if ever you had any, is even dead and decayed with you, and you
have outlived your prime etc.

Verse 3. But I have understanding as well as you] Think not that you have
engrossed all the knowledge, and that you have the monopoly of wisdom in your
breasts, for surely I may come into the balance with you, and claim as great a
share in understanding as your selves. Zophar was pleased to call me hollow and
heartlesse, chap. 11.12. But I have an heart (so the Hebrew here has it) that
seat of understanding: and that shall appear in the ensuing discourse, where
Job proves, that by solid arguments concerning Gods power, wisdom, etc. which
Zophar had but barely propounded. And whereas this patient man was not without
his impatiencies, yet he discovers more grace, even in his distempers, then
his friends did in their seeming wise carriages. Breaking out in the body
shows strength of nature. Some infirmities discover more good, then some
seeming beautiful actions.

I am not inferior to you] Heb. I fall not lower then you. See Nehem. 6.16.
Esth. 6.13. Job 13.2. He means, that he was much their superior, and did
better understand the doctrine of Gods providence then they. This he speaks
not out of any vainglory, or ambitious boasting; but as David, and Paul, and
others after them did, commending themselves, either in defense of their own
wronged innocence, or when it appeared unto them, that the concealing of their
good parts and practices might turn to the hindrance of the truth, or to the
hurt of the Church, or to the impairing and impeaching of Gods glory. In these
cases, self-commendation is not unseemly: but a Job may lawfully stand upon,
not his comparisons only, but his disparisons also.

Yea, who knows not such things as these?] Viz. That God rewards the
righteous, and punishes the ungodly. The Heathen saw this by the rush-candle
of natures dim light. Does not nature it self teach you? says Paul 1 Cor.
11.14. And again, This ye know, that no whoremonger etc. has any inheritance
in the kingdom of God, and of Christ, Ephesians. 5.5.

Verse 4. I am as one mocked of his neighbour] Those that should countenance
and comfort me, contemn and scorn me. I am their laughter and pastime; so he
took it, since they sat so heavily upon the skirts of his conscience, and would
not weigh his reasons brought in his own defense.

Who calls upon God, and he answers him] i. e. I Job do make God my refuge,
when these jeering neighbors of mine do shame my counsel, Psalm 14.6. and
would mock me out of my religion: but God favors me though men frown: and
where humane help fails, divine appears. Or thus rather: I am derided of
those who profess to call upon God, and to hear often from heaven. They are
hard-hearted to me, though themselves have liberally tasted of Gods
tenderness: and they pull up the bridge of mercy before me, which themselves
have often gone over.

The just upright man is laughed to scorn] Shame shall be the promotion of
fools, Prove. 3.35. and such a dissembler as Doeg may well be derided, Psalm
52.6, 7. But what has the righteous done? And why should just, upright Job be
laughed to scorn? Isa. 8.18.
But this is no news: Christ and his people have ever been for signs, and for
wonders in this mad world, always besides it self in point of salvation. He
that departs, from evil, makes himself a prey, or is accounted mad, Isai.
59.15. If he will needs be a just upright man, if he will live godly in Christ
Jesus (if he be so set upon it, that none shall hinder him) he shall suffer
persecution, this of the tongue howsoever, 2 Timothy 3.12. A wolf flies not upon
a painted sheep; we can look upon a painted toad with delight: it is the
reality of godliness that is hated.

Verse 5. He that is ready to slip with his feet] He who is in a declining,
tottering condition, ready to fall and perish under the burden of his
afflictions, though formerly he was looked upon and made use of as a lamp or
torch, yet when he is at an under, and brought low, is shamefully slighted by
such as have the world at will: like as a torch when wasted and waxen short is
cast out of the hands, and trodden on with the feet of him that held it. The
holiest men, if afflicted, do but smother in stead of shining. When Christ
himself was a man of sorrows, he was therefore despised and rejected of men,
who hid, as it were, their faces from him, and esteemed him not, Isa. 53.3. The
Prodigals elder brother speaks scornfully of him, because poor, Luke 15.30.
This thy son; he says not, This my brother etc. Gregory says, that the poor
just man is here compared to a lamp extinct, because he shines inwardly by the
virtue of an upright heart: but outwardly is as it were extinct, because there
is nothing outward to commend him; no glorious appearel, no goodly houses, etc.
whence they are slighted by the rich wretches of this world. But such a lamp
(says he, following the Vulgar translation) is set for an appointed time; that
is, the day of judgment, when he shall shine most brightly, even as the Sun
etc. when the worlds favorites shall be thrust into utter darkness.

Verse 6. The tabernacles of robbers prosper] By Robbers here understand all
such as sin against the second table, but especially oppressors, and
wrong-dealers, whether by force or fraud. As by those that provoke God (quires
Dei interturbant, so the Tigurines translate) that irritate and disquiet him,
attempting to put him out of temper, are meant sinners against the first table.
See the like 1 Timothy 1.13. I was (against God) a blasphemer, (against man) a
persecutor, against both injurious: but I obtained mercy, special mercy. So do
not these Robbers and God-provokers in the text: thrive they may, and be in a
peaceable condition; yea, they may be secure and confident of the continuance
of their prosperity: confidences are to them; says the Hebrew verity; for they
trust in uncertain riches, whiles God brings into their hands, viz.
whatsoever they wish, yet not as love tokens, but as wrath-tokens: these
fatting beasts are but fitting for the slaughter. God often gives that in wrath
to some, which he withholds from others in great mercy. Meanwhile Zophars
twofold assertion in the former chapter, verse 17, 20. that good men prosper
here, and bad men suffer, falls to the ground; whiles Job disproves it, 1. By
experience in this verse and the former. 2. By the testimony of the creatures,
those Catholic preachers, ver. 7, 8, 9, 10. 3. By the testimony of the senses,
and of ancient men, verse 11, 12.

Verse 7. But ask now the beasts of the earth, and they shall teach thee] Even
the wildest of them that abide in the wilderness: there is not one of these,
or else of the fouls of the air, but can both teach thee, and tell thee that
the world is ordered by a providence, that God is Powerful, Wise, Just, etc.
and must therefore be loved and served. That he suffers the bad to oppress
the good, as the great beasts do devour the little ones; as the hurtful fouls
destroy the harmless; as the great fishes eat up the smaller: man, who was
once the Captain of Gods school, is now, for his truantlinesse, turned down
into the lowest form, as it were, to learn his A b c again; yea, to learn it of
the meanest creatures. See Prove. 6.6. Jer. 8.7. Matthew. 6.26. where it
appears, that in the Ant, Stork, Swallow, etc. God has set before us, as in
a picture, the lively resemblance of many excellent virtues, which we ought to
pursue and practice. These are the right lay-mens-books, the images that may
truly teach people the knowledge of God, and of his will, of themselves, and of
their duties: which we should the rather learn; because God has given us
wisdom beyond them, Job 37.11. and yet by sending us to them, shameth our
dullness and disobedience.

Verse 8. Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee] Teach thee? What?
Terra quam termius docet terram quam gerimus.
surely many good lessons; as that of humility and modesty, considering out
original: that of fruitfulness, whiles she liberally yields her riches and
strength, and brings forth food for the maintenance of those innumerable armies
of creatures that live upon her: but especially, and for the purpose, this the
earth teaches, that the tabernacles of robbers prosper, that oppressors
swallow down most of her delicates, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, ruffle in
her silks, and rifle in her hid treasures of gold and silver.

And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee] These muti magistri have
somewhat also to say to thee, and by a dumb kind of eloquence read thee a
divinity-lecture, whilst they are able to produce many such particular
examples of violence in the seas; and will further declare (or ciphe up unto
thee) how often they are served up to great men's tables, and do fill the far
paunches of oppressors. It is not unlikely that Job, in this frequent sending
Zophar to school to the unreasonable and inanimate creatures, closely twitteth
him with those quicker questions of his, chap. 10.8. What can thou do? what
can thou know, etc.? giving him also to know that he need not travel so far
as heaven or hell for instances of Gods infant^ power and wisdom, since we may
contemplate the footsteps of God in each creature: and since he is so near
unto us, (...) Acts 17.
that he may be almost felt with our hands, as Paul speaks.

Verse 9. Who knows not in all these etc.] Or, By all these forementioned
creatures etc. and therefore Zophar, you have showed no more wisdom in your
lofty discourse, Theologia cryptica.
then the birds, beasts, and fishes have taught and told us. It is a silly
vanity to pretend mysteriousnesse about vulgar truths; to dig deep for that
which lies above ground; to talk of new truths, and never before heard of,
when as the hearer may well say, as here, Who knows not such things as these?
Of some in these days it is observed, that they call upon their hearers to
mark, it may be they shall hear that which they have not heard before: when the
thing is either false, or if true, no more then ordinarily is taught by others.

That the hand of the Lord has wrought this] That he alone made all without
tool or toil, and that he alone manageth and orders all according to the
good pleasure of his will: neither need he subscribe his name to his work; for
the very things that he has made, proclaim that he made them. Mean while,
hereby we may see how much we are beholden to Aristotle, Elian, Gesner, and
other Learned men, who have written books concerning the Natures of living
creatures.

Verse 10. In whose hand is the soul of every living thing] That is, the life
of every beast, flowing from a sensitive soul, Lev. 17, 10, 11. This, God both
gives to the creature, and conserveth it: he suffers it not to be taken away
from little sparrows, or the like, without order from him: much less befalls
any such thing to man without his singular providence, since our very hairs also
are numbered, Matthew. 10.30. Luke 12.7. The Jew-doctors do therefore offer
manifest injury to Job, when they say, that he held indeed that God created,
and does preserve the several kinds of things, but permits the particulars
and individua's to hap-hazard; whereas here he delivers his judgment plainly
to the contrary, when he says,

And the breath of all mankind] Heb. The spirit of all man's flesh (and so
Broughton reads it) that is, of every man's body: hence God is called the God
of the spirits of all flesh, Numb. 16.22. and the Father of Spirits, Heb. 12.9.
and the Former of the spirit of man within him, Zech. 12.1. My times are in
thine hand, says David, Psalm 31.15. God preserves our lives as a light in a
lantern: and we may be glad it is in so safe an hand; we should therefore
honor him, as Daniel tells Belshazzer, Dan. 5.23. yea, let every thing that
has breath praise the Lord, Psalm 150.6. Or as the Hebrew has it, Let every
breath praise the Lord: as often as we breathe, we are to breathe out the praise
of God, and to make our breath like the smoke of the Tabernacle: Isai. 3. ult.
this we should do the rather, because our breath is in our nostrils, every
moment ready to puff out, and the grave cannot praise God, death cannot
celebrate him, Isai. 38.18.

Verse 11. Does not the ear try words etc.] The mind may as easily conceive of
these truths, as the ear judges certainly of the variety of sounds, and the
tongue of the diversity of tastes: neither may you think that I will, without
any examination or distinction, allow of your discourses; or that I can take it
well that you reject, as void of reason, whatsoever I have said, without once
weighing it. The ear is one of the two learned senses, it is an instrument of
discipline: only it should be kept clean and free from prejudice or passion,
which will be as gall in the ear. See Exodus ^.9. Demosthenes called often upon
his Athenians to get their ears purged of tholer: Quadam animalia fell in aure
gestant. Ozen. moznajin.
and Alexander, when he heard a cause, was wont always to keep (...) one ear
free for the other party: he would not be prepossessed. Mercer observes, that
the Hebrew word for an ear, does in the duall number signify a pair of
balancer, to note, that a judicious Christian takes not up truth upon trust,
but considers first, and afterward believes; he tries all things, and then
holds first that which is good, but abstaineth from all appearance of evil, 1
These. 5.21, 22. The ear and the mind are in the Greek tongue very like in
sound: the mind judges of the truth of words by the ears, (...)
as the hearn in a pair of balances determines the just weight of things by
the two scales. He that is spiritual discerns all things, 1 Cor. 2.15. he
has spiritual sense^. Philip. 1.9. senses exercised, habitually exercised, to
(...) good and evil, H^b 5.14. his service is a rational service, Romans 12.1 his
obedience the obedience of faith, Romans 16.26. Whereas the natural man is
carried away as he is led, 2 Cor. 12.2. pulled away with the error of the
wicked, 2 Pet. 3.17. taken prisoner by seducers, 2 Timothy 3.6. and by them made
prize of, Col. 2.8. as having either no skill, or no will to examine what is
doctrinally propounded to him.

As the mouth tastes his meat] Heb. the palate, which is the proper instrument
of tasting: Now the order of nature requires (says one) that seeing our
bodily senses, are so nimble and able to discern what is sour, what sweet, etc.
Sensorium. Merlin in loc.
our understandings also should do the same by right reason: and the contrary
is very absurd and unbecoming a man; neither can there be any good excuse made
for our dullness, if we bend not our minds to the search of the truth, for as
much as there is so much ado made to please the palate, eyes, ears, and other
senses: Catullus wished all his body were nose, that he might-spend all his
time in sweet smells. Philoxenus, that his neck were as long as a Cranes, that
he might take more delight in meats and drinks (it seems that he placed tasting
not in the mouth, but in the throat.) Boccace the Italian Poet said, that he
was born a^ amore delle done, for the love of women: and of a prodigal
pleasure-monger in London, we read, Theater of Gods judgm.
that to please all his five senses at once, he allowed to the delight of every
several sense, a several hundred pound. See the Note on Amos 6.6. There is a
sancta crapula, an holy gluttony, as Luther calls an hearty feeding on divine
viands, a finding fatness and sweetness beyond that of the honey and honeycomb
in Gods Ordinances, Psalm 63.5, 6.
crying to Jesus Christ as the Spouse does Cant. 8.13. Cause me to hearken to
thy voice: and obeying him, thus bespeaking us, Eat o friends, drink. yea,
drink abundantly o beloved, till you are even inebriated with loves, Cant. 5.1.

Verse 12. With the ancient is wisedome] Heb. with the decrepit, who have a
long, long being upon earth, and are now become wondrous old, even four-score
and upward: with such is wisdom, or else it is a shame for them. See 1 John
2.12. Heb. 5.12. True it is, that wisdom does not always lean upon a staff,
nor look through spectacles. Age is no just measure of wisdom: there are
beardlesse sages, (as was Solomon) and gray headed children, as Rehoboam.
Macarius was called (...), the old youth; ( Samuel, Daniel, Timothy were such.)
When Arsacius, who succeeded Chrysostom, was an old dotrel of fourscore years,

succeeded Nazianzen, was a mere novice, and preferred to that place, only
because he was of a venerable aspect, and of a bishop-like presence and
deportment. Veneranda^ canitie, and vulva sacerdote digno-Baron.
Of the Brabants Erasmus testifies, that the elder they are, the foolisher.
And Job here seems to tax his friends, that though old, yet they were not
over-wise, not worthy of their years: since they understood not what he spoke
concerning Gods providence: Is wisdom with the ancient, says he, and
understanding in length of days? so some read it question-wise, q. d. it ill
appears.

And in length of days, understanding] By reason of their much observation,
and frequent experience, together with their ability to draw other things out
of those they have observed, and from former events to presage future. This is
to be understood of such old men as are like flowers, which have their roots
perfect, when themselves are withering; as with roses, keep a sweet savor
though they lose their color; as with the Sun, shine most amiably at their
going down. But lest we should attribute too much to such sages, Job shows in
the next verse, that all their wisdom is but derivative, and that all their
understanding is but a spark of Gods flame, a drop of his Ocean.

Verse 13. With him is wisdom and strength etc] Wisdom, strength, counsel,
and understanding, are all concentred in the Ancient of days: complete he is
in all excellencies and perfections, all which do meet in him, and continue
always in the highest degree. The mighty God faints not, neither is weary:
there is no searching of his understanding Isai. 40.28. He is also no less
good then great and wise; good, original, universal, all-sufficient, and
satisfactory, proportionable, and fitting for our soul; which as it was made by
him, and for him, so it is never at quiet till it rests in him. See chap. 9.4.

He has counsel and understanding] Counsel he has, but without consultation:
Wisdom, but without experience: Knowledge, but without discourse: Decree, but
without deliberation: Aug.
Loquimur de Deo etc. we speak of God. says one, not as we ought, but as we
are able. And these things we speak of God (says another Father) because we
find not what better to speak of him. But Job has a mind to say the utmost
that may be said.

Verse 14. Beheld, he breaks down, and it connot be built again] As he did
the old world, Sodom and Gomorrah, many Monarchies and Empires, the Tower of
Babel, and other castles and houses which now live by fame only, If at all. If
God have a mind to mine these, who shall raise or repair them? Julian the

set the Jews awork to reedifie the Temple at Jerusalem, but they could never
effect it, by reason of a terrible earthquake, that slew the workmen, and
marred the materials. The Arian Bishops held a second Council at Nice, with
purpose to have abolished the memory of the first, together with the Nicene
Creed, Func.
and to have established Arianism: but God disappointed them, and sent them
packing thence by a huge earthquake, which overturned a great part of that
city, and destroyed a number of people. Constans Nephew to Heraclius the Greek

and (three hundred years after him) Oath Emperor of Germany, endeavored, but

would not suffer it so to be, says Genebrard, because the Kingdom of the
Church, foretold by Daniel, was to have its seat there. If he had said, the
kingdom of Antichrist foretold by Paul, and John the Divine, he had hit the
nail on the very head.

He shuts up a man, and there can be no opening] He clappeth him up close
prisoner, as Manasseh, Zedekiah, Bajazet, Boniface the 8. etc) or fasteneth him
to his bed by some chronical disease (as he did Abimelech, Ahaziab, Asa,
Aeneas, Acts 9.33.) or otherwise straiteneth him that he knows not how to help
himself, as he did Pharaoh, Saul (when the Philistims were upon him of every
side) those refractaries in Isaiah, chap. 9.2. and shall do the whore of
Babylon, Rev. 18. when her lovers shall bewail her, but not be able to bestead
her, ver. 9, 10. For when God shuts up any in this sort, they must lie by it
till he please to release them, and extricate them, as he did Joseph
Jehoshaphat, David, Peter, Valentinian. and many others, when they were even
forsaken of their hopes.

Verse 15. Behold he withholds the waters, and they dry up] He not only when
he pleases, imprisoneth men, but waters also, that they cannot get out of the
clouds, those bottles of rain, those airy sponges, vessels as thin as the
liquor that is contained in them: it is from the power of God that they
dissolve not upon us at once, and overwhelm us. Bartholinus reports that in the
year of grace 1551. a great number of men and cattle were drowned by the sudden
breaking of a cloud, diverse vine-yeards, De meteor. li. 2.
stone walls, strong houses, were destroyed and ruined. At sea sometimes, ships
are by the same means sunk, seamen call it a spo^t. Again, it is by the anger
and judgments of God that the clouds are sometimes so closed up, that they
yield no more water then iron or adamant: If I shut up heaven, says he, that
there the no rain, 2 Chronicles. 7.13. and Deuteronomy. 28.23, 24. God threateneth, as a
punishment of men's sin, that the heavens over their heads shall be brass, and
the earth under them shall be iron; that the rain of their land shall be made
powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon them etc. by exceeding
great drought, grains of dust shall ascend into the air with the wind, and come
down as the drops of rain in a shower when it is kindly weather. Thus it was in
A^obe days 1 King. 18. See Joel 1.20. with the Note.

And they dry up] The rivers, fruits of the earth, roots of trees, all dry up,
languish, and perish, fevers also, and other acute diseases abound.

Also he sends them out, and they overturn the earth] They did so with an
accent in the general deluge, and in Deucalious flood in Thessaly, besides many
other great tracts and parts of the earth over-turned by water. Pliny and
Seneca give us sundry instances of towns and countries laid waste by water.
What great hurt was lately done about Amsterdam by water, and what breaking
down of bridges, mills, and other houses, Prin. Not. hist. lib. 2. cap. 90.92.
Sen. Not. quast. lib. 6. cap. 23.
by excessive rain, and floods thereupon, besides marring of grounds, and
rotting of cattle in many places amongst us, needs not here to be related.

Verse 16. With him is strength and wisedome] i. e. Such strength as he
exercises most wisely, mightily and righteously. Sic volo, sic (...), says
the Tyrant, Right or wrong, thus it shall be: Volumus and ^u^emus, says that
man of sin, we will and command etc. neither must any one mute or say so much
as what do thou? upon pain of damnation. When Constantius would have
Paulinus, Lucifer, and other Bishops subscribe against Athanasius, and
communicate with the Arians, he yielded to no other reason but this, Quod ego
volo, pro canone fit, Do as I bid, or get you into banishment. But God, though
he has all power in his hand, and may do whatsoever he pleases, yet with him
is strength and equity (so Vatabius renders the word Tusbijah here used) or
the being, substance, and permanency of all creatures (so Munster) which
subsist merely by his manutention: or, the rule and certain law of wisdom and
judgment, by which wisdom acts, says Mercer. So then the Lord, though he
make his will a law, yet he cannot do otherwise then well, because nothing but
wisdom and equity is in it.

The deceived, and the deceiver are his] This Job produces as a proof of Gods
insuperable strength, and unsearchable wisdom, that he has an overruling
hand in the artifices and slights of men, even the cunning craftiness (as the
Apostle speaks) Ephesians. 4.14. Whereby they lie in wait to deceive. These he not
only and barely permits in his just judgment upon the deceived (whether
through ignorance, or idleness) but disposes also, and orders both the
deceiver and the deceived, (whether in spiritual things, or civil) to his own
righteous ends, and holy purposes. See Ezekiel. 14.9. 1 Kin. 22.19, 20 2 These.
2.11. Isa. 19.14. and then conclude with Job, that wisdom and strength are
his, who can thus draw light out of darkness, and powerfully order the
disorders of the world to his own glory, and the good of his people: For there
must be heresies, that they which are approved may be made manifest, 1 Cor.
11.9. Meanwhile, here is the comfort of every good soul, that none can take
them out of the Father hands, Job. 10.29. and it is impossible that the elect
should be totally and finally deceived, because both the deceived and the
deceiver are Gods: by him, and from him, and for him are deceivers and
deceived, (so Broughton translateth this text). By him, for he suffers and
orders them: From him, for he sends them: And For him, for they promote his
glory, and serve his ends. He many times suffers the tree of the Church to be
shaken, that rotten fruit may drop off. There are the set this sense upon the
words; they are both in Gods hands, the deceiver to have revenge taken upon
him, and the deceived who revengeth not himself to have his cause righted, as 1
These. 4.6. an argument both of Gods wisdom to find out the deceiver, how
subtle soever: and likewise of his power in punishing them, how potent soever.

Verse 17. He leads counselors away spoiled] Viz. Of wit, wealth, and
honor. This should be a warning to such not to take ill causes in hand, not to
call evil good, and good evil, not to justify the wicked for a reward, and to
take away the righteousness of the righteous from him; not to bolster out a
bad cause, and to outface a good, lest if they improve their wits and parts to
so evil an end, God make them as despicable as before they were honorable.
They may see what the Lord did to Abitophel that Oracle of his time, to
Pharaohs counselors, Isa. 19.11, 12. to Pharaoh himself, Ex. 1.10. with Pr.
28.15.

And he makes the Judges fools] Broughton renders the verse thus, He brings
Counselors to badnesse, and Judges to stark madness: He infatuateth them, not
by infusing folly into them any more, then the Sun when he shines not in our
Horizon, causes darkness in the air, which of it self, and of its own nature
is dark: But when God withholds that light of wisdom which he had imparted
to a man, his inbred darkness must needs show it self. More then this, it
sometimes comes to pass, that when God delivers a man up for his sins to a
reprobate sense to an injudicious mind, he is thenceforth deprived sometimes of
natural wisdom, and common sense, that the divine revenge may be the more
apparent.

Verse 18. He loses the bonds of Kings] He degradeth them, taking away all
command and authority from them, which is the bond that binds the people to
obedience and subjection; Job 30.11. Isai. 45.1, 5. as our Henry the third,
Daniel.
who was called Regni dilapidator, ill beloved of his people, and far a less
King (says the Chronicler) by striving to be more then he was: the just reward
of violations.

And gardeth their loins with a girdle] With a rope, say the Vulgar: he brings
them from the throne to the prison: he lays affliction upon their loins,
Val. Max Christ. page 267.
as Psalm 66.11. An instance hereof (beside the late King, and Corradinus King
of Germany likewise beheaded at Naples) we had here in Richard the second,
brought forth in a royal robe to be deposed, and then hunger-starved in prison:
as also in Henry the sixth, who having been the most potent Monarch for
dominions that ever England had, was afterward (when deposed) not the Master
of a molehill, nor owner of his own liberty, but baffled and beaten by every
base fellow. Some Interpreters make the sense of this to be thus; God sometimes
loses the bonds, into which Princes are brought, and advances them again to
kingly dignity, the ensign whereof, was of old a precious girdle. So it befell
Manasseh, Nebuchadnezzar, Jehoiakins, restored and honored again as a king,
by Evilmerodach, 2 Kings 25.28 Historians write, that Nebuchadnezzar was so
offended with his son and successor Evilmerodach, as he cast him into prison,
and that in prison he and Jehoiakim became acquainted together, whence his
advancement afterward.

Verse 19. He leads away Princes spoiled] Or Priests Ducit sacerdotes
inglerias, so the Vulgar translateth, He leads away the Priests without
glory, dishonored. Priests were generally much esteemed and privileged in all
ages. Alexander the great gave greatest respect to Jaddus the Jewish
High Priest. When the Gauls had burnt Rome, and were besieging the Capitol,
Caius Fabius Dorso, attired as a Priest, with his sacrifice, and other
necessaries in his hand, marched through the midst of the enemies, astonished
at his resolution, offered his sacrifice on the hill Quirinalis, and returned
in safety. The Bardi, a kind of Priests, were here in Albion of such esteem
among the greatest commanders, that if two armies were even at push of pike,
and a Bard had stepped in betwixt them, they would have held their hands,
hearkened to his advice, and not have offered to strike till he were out of
danger: Magna fuit quondam capitis reverentia sacri. Howbeit, such also have
been carried captive, and slain by the enemy, as was Seraiah the high priest
by Nebuchadnezzar; and before him the two sons of Eli (whose white Ephod
covered foul sins) slain by the Philistims. The Lord has despised in the
indignation of his anger, both the King and the Priest, Lam. 2.6. Both the
Prophet and the Priest go about into a land that they know not, Jer. 14.18. The
word Cohen is used indifferently to signify a Priest, or Prince, an
Ecclesiastical or secular Governor. Broughton renders it here Dukes; others,
Presidents or praefects of Provinces: Honor is no shelter against the wrath of
God.

And overthrows the mighty] Such as might seem unmovable, as a rock or tree
firmly rooted; these God shakes and shattereth to pieces, he rooteth them up,
and ruineth them. Let no man think to prevail by strength, 1 Samuel 2.9. since the
weakness of God (if any such thing there were) is stronger then men, 1 Cor.
1.25. He will smite his enemies (as so many puny-boyes) in the hinder-parts,
and so put them to a perpetual reproach, Psalm 78.66. Yea, he will not only
smite them on the loins, but through the loins, ( Deuteronomy. 32.11.) that they never
rise again. Let them therefore learn to meddle with their match, Eccl. 6.10. and
take heed how they fall into the punishing hands of the living God.

Verse 20. He removes away the speech of the trusty] Or, of the eloquent, as
Demosthenes the most eloquent of the Greeks, being by them frequently sent as
an Ambassador to Philip King of Macedony, thrice stood speechless before him,
and thirty several times forgot those things which he had thought to have
spoken, as Tz^tzes testifies, Chiliad. 7.
So Latomus of Lovain, that Apostate and Persecutor of the truth, having
prepared an elegant Oration to make to Charles the fifth Emperor, was so
confounded, that he could hardly speak a word of sense; the grief whereof broke
his heart. The Counselor, and the Eloquent Orator, the Prudent, and the
Ancient are reckoned up as the stay, and the staff, the beauty, and bulwark of
a Nation, Isa. 3.2, 3 These God removes at his pleasure, and for a general
judgment, causing either them to dye, or their abilities to die and decay, or
crossing their attempts that they shall speak perswasively, but not persuade
people, but be slighted and exploded of all. Veracium.
Yea, though they be Truth-speakers (so the Vulgar has it;) or Trusty (as our
translation) Confiding men, as they are called, worthy to be trusted; such
faithful counselors as Polybius was to Scipio, who never miscarried in any
thing wherein he followed his advice, as the Historian testifies: yet God can
remove or change the speech of such, by leaving them to their own
unfaithfulness and inconstancy, as we have plentifully experimented in these
late discriminating and shedding times.

And takes away the understanding of the aged] Heb. And takes the sense, or
savor, or raste of the Elders or Senators, that they shall be no more able to
discern and determine what is true or false, right or wrong, then old Barzilla^
could skill of the Court-meates and music. See this threatened, Isai. 29.14.
Such old men as either were bred Scholars, or have had much experience in the
management of great affairs, are presumed to be of great understanding: but God
can either take such away, as he threateneth to do, Isa. 3.3, 4. or take away
their wisdom, to render them useless to the public: as it is reported of
Theodorus Gaza, and of Albertus Magnus, those great Scholars, that for certain
years before they died, they did so dote, and were so childish, that they could
not write their own names, or read a letter on the book. Let therefore the
Eloquent, and the aged take heed they abuse not their abilities, lest they
forget and lose them.

Verse 21. He pours contempt upon Princes] Or Nobles, or Gentlemen, which
are, or should be free, bounteous, munificent benefactors: if they be not
Nedibim, (...)
but Nebalim, liberal, but churlish, (see these opposed Isa. 32.5.) it is just
in God to pour contempt, to lay abundance of shame and scorn upon them, as
sordid, penny-fathers, ignoble, Euclio's, poor-spirited men, the base brood, or
rather, blot of their better forefathers. Of out Edward the second it is
chronicled, that never was Prince received with greater love and opinion of all
then he; or never any that sooner lost it; for his very first action in
recalling his minion Pierce Gaveston, Daniel.
discovered an headstrong wilfulness, that was uncounsellable: hence he was
slighted by his subjects, pursued by his wife and son, and at length cruelly
murdered. Mercer observes, that David has the self-same words, Psalm 107.40.
that are found here, and verse 24. Neither need we wonder, since they both spoke
by the same spirit.

And weakneth the strength of the mighty] Heb. He slackneth the girdle of the
impetuous, that like strong streams in narrow straits, bear down all before
them. So do Soldiers in war; see 2 Samuel 22.16. Job 6.15. But God can loose
their girdles (or belts, which bind their garments, and buckle their armor
close to them) he can dispirit them, and make them feeble and faint-hearted, as
he did Samson, and those Assyrians Psalm 76.5, 6. By this whole discourse of
Job it appears, that he had very diligently observed Gods providence, and way
of administration in the several ranks of men, and alterations of
commonwealths; whereby he had learned secretly to admire and adore Gods
judgments, which thing we ought also semblably to do.

Verse 22. He discovers deep things out of darknesse] As he did to Joseph and
Pharaoh by dreams, to the Prophets by visions and revelations, and still does
to his people by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yea, the deep
things of God, 1 Cor. 2.10. He brings to light also the hidden things of
darkness, hellish conspiracies, as in the Powder Plot, the deep reaches of
Kings to maintain their authority, and compass their designs, resolving to
suffer never a rub to lie in their way, that might hinder the true running of
their bowl. Philip de Comines dived so deep, Heyl. Geog.
and wrote so plainly of the Stately affairs (those arcana imperii) that
Katharine de Medices (Queen Mother of France) was wont to say, that he had made
as many heretics policy, as Luther had done in Religion: she saw not that God
had set Comines awork, and that he will yet further bring out to light (that
all men may see) the shadow of death; that is, the things that are most
abstruse, and most unlikely ever to have been discovered: see Matthew. 16.26.
with the Note: and say, Woe to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from
the Lord, Isai. 29.15. The powder plot was a deep thing of darkness, it was
under ground, they were so long digging in their vault of villainy; and a long
time it was secreted under oaths, and strongest concealments: But a bird of the
air revealed it, and that which had wing told the matter, Eccles. 10.20. It was
a quill, a piece of a wing brought all to light by a blind letter put (by a
providence) into a wrong hand: the danger was at the very (...), within eight
hours of being acted, when from a match ready fired, we received a matchless
deliverance: Say then, (...)

Verse 23. He increases the Nations, and destroys them] It is all one with
God, whether against a single man, or a whole Nation, Job 34.29. when he once
takes them to do. The wicked shall be turned into hell, and (that they may not
hope to escape because a multitude) all the nations that forget God, Psalm
9.17. Soon after the flood, the Babel-builders were scattered, Sedom and her
sisters were not only consumed with fire from heaven, Gen, 19. but thrown forth
for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire, Jude 7. some Nations
were ejected, and others substituted, Deuteronomy, 2.10, 12, 20. Some utterly wasted
and rooted out, as the Edomites, Ammonites Moabites, etc. that live by fame
only; others not so much as by fame, their very names being blotted out from
under heaven. The cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without
man, and the land is utterly desolate, Isai. 6.11. Now all this is the Lords
own doing, and should be mavelous in our eyes. He plants and plucks up, he
builds and breaks down, Jerem. 31.28.

He enlarges the Nations, and straitneth them again] Or That he may straiten
them again, so in the former clause, That he may destroy them: This if he may
justly do to whole nations, why should it seem so strange, that he suffers
particular persons though wicked, to prosper for a season; and though righteous
for a while, to suffer hardship?

Verse 24. He takes away the heart of the chief of the people] That is, of
the greatest part of the people of the world (say some) these God suffers to
walk in their own ways, Acts 14.16. To become vain in their imaginations, and
their foolish heart is darkened; professing themselves to be wise, they became
fools, Romans 1.21, 22. As the Philosophers of old, and the Chinese at this day,
who are known to be ingenious, and use to say of themselves, that all other
nations of the world see but with one eye, they only with two; yet continue
they gross Idolaters, Descrip. of the world, of China and Cataia.
mere heathens, having no less then an hundred thousand gods, which they
worship one while, and whip another, if they come not at a call. But the most
Interpreters, by chief, or heads of the people, here understand their
Governors, of whom though Job had said as much in effect before, (17) viz. that
God dispiriteth and besotteth them for a plague to the people who follow their
Rulers (and fall with them) as the body of a beast follows the head, yet
because few observe and improve this truth, therefore he repeateth and
illustrateth it by three elegant Similies. And first,

He causes them to wander in a wilderness etc.] Not knowing which way to
extricate themselves, they beat their brains about it, but to no purpose; they
are so bewildered and puzzled, as if they were treading a maze: and this God
causes, he is active in it, whiles he with-draweth his light, and delivers
them up to their own foolish hearts, and to the Prince of darkness, to be
further benighted, 2 Cor. 4.4.

Verse 25. They grope in the dark without light] This is the second Similie,
setting forth this judiciary act of God in taking away the heart of the heads
of the earth: grope they do, and would fain find out a way by feeling, but they
feel darkness, and not light (so the Hebrew has it) they try to help
themselves and their people out of misery, as the last Greek Emperor did
notably; but it would not be. Turk. hist. 345.


And he makes them to stagger like a drunken man] Who having lost the use of
reason, knows neither where he is, nor what he was, but reeleth and falls
often, and cannot rise again, much less go forward. So fares it with evil
rulers when God smites them with a spirit of giddiness, and of slumber. See
Isa. 19.24. and 04.20.

CHAP. XIII.
Verse 1. LO mine eye has seen all this] sc. All those effects of Gods
providence, declared in the former chapter. I have not discoursed of Gods
powerful and wise dispensations by rote, or without book; I have not blurted
out what I believe not, or am not able to prove, as you have accused me; but I
have spoken both that which I have seen (and what more sure then sight?) and
that which I have heard and received from our Ancestors and Doctors (to whom
you have frequently referred me, for better information) mine ear that sense of
discipline, by which, not learning only, but life also enters, Isai. 55.3.)
has heard it, and understood it too; which he adds for further assurance.
Job was a Weighing Hearer, Mr. Clark in his life.
as Mr. Bradshaw was called the Weighing Divine: let us learn by his example
heedfully to observe Gods works, laying up experiences, and diligently to
listen and learn the things that are taught us, or written for us by others,
that we may grow to a right and ripe understanding of divine truths, and be
able confidently to commend the same to others, as being upon sure grounds. See
Matthew. 13.51, 52.

Verse 2. What y^ know, the same do I know also] Heb. According to your
knowledge I also know: this may seem an unbeseeming boast; which if his friends
had taxed him for, he might have answered, as Paul did in a like case, Ye have
compelled me, 2 Cor. 11.5. The Rule is, let nothing be done through strife, or
vainglory, but in lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better then
themselves, Philip. 2.3. Non est tamen prodenda Dei veritas, aut integritas
nostra etc. Nevertheless, Merlin. in loc.
no man ought to betray the truth, or his own integrity, lest he should he
counted contentious. See chap. 12.3. where we have the same in effect as here,
whence some do gather, that Jobs friends had a very high opinion of their own
knowledge, and a very low one of Jobs. He that is thus proud of his knowledge,
the devil cares not how much he knows.

Verse 3. Surely I would speak to the Almighty] It were far better for me to
speak to God, then to you, and much fairer dealing from him I might expect; a
God of truth, and without iniquity, just and right is he, Deuteronomy. 32.4. But ye
are Jorgers of lies, and ye load me with false accusations, depraving my
speeches, as thou Zophar especially have done, wishing withal that God himself
would speak with me face to face; which, if it should come to pass, thou
said my misery and affliction would be redoubled. But oh that I might commune
with the Almighty! surely and seriously I would rather do it, then with you my
friends, and should hope so to defend mine innocence against your slanderous
accusations; yea, to maintain Gods justice against you, in the presence and
judgment of God himself. O the confidence of a good conscience! see it in
Abimelech, Genesis 20.5. but much more in David, Psalm. 7.3, 4. And Psalm 139.23,
24. In Jeremiah, chap. 12.1. in every strong believer, 1 Pet. 3.21. Those that
walk uprightly, and speak uprightly, Isai. 33.15. Not so every (...)
Christian, or profligate professor, verse 14. The sinners in Zion are afraid,
fearfulness surprizeth the hypocrites, etc. but good Job was none such; and God
knew it to be so: what if to the wicked he be a devouring fire? yet to those
that fear his name he is a reviving Sun, Mal. 4.1, 2. And upright Job fears
not to reason with him: upon the same ground John Hus, and other Martyrs cited
their persecutors to answer them by such a time before Gods tribunal.

And I desire to reason with God] If he please; So the Septuagint add,
Sivo^^erit.
and make out Jobs meaning: as if he had used the like modesty and humility,
Neh. 2.4. Esth. 5.4.
as Nehemiah, and after him Esther did in their suits unto the King of Persia,
when they said, if it seem good to the King, and if I have found favor in his
sight. Others think that Job here desires to plead with God as with a party
that had dealt too hardly with him etc. that he challenges God into the
schools, as it were, there to crack an argument with him, and by reason to
reduce him to milder dealing. And indeed, the Hebrew word here used, signifies
to dispute (...), and from it the Rabbines call Logic the Art of arguing. This
boldness is that, say our large Annotations, which both Elihu and God blame
Job for in the end of the book, though neither of them condemn him for an
hypocrite: and that shows that Job did speak amiss of God in his passion, and
is not altogether to be excused; much less in every thing to be commended.

Verse 4. But ye are forgers of lies] i. e. Ye create false maxims to judge me
by; ye gather up without any order, and to no purpose whatsoever comes in your
way to strengthen and maintain your false accusation against me. You are not
only concinnatores, Mendacia mendaciis assuitis.
forgers, but compactores, botchers, such as by sowing one lie to another, do
patch up a false and frivolous discourse. So David, Psalm 119.69. The proud
have forged (or pieced together, made it up as of many shreds) a lie against
me. David says of hypocrites, that their tongue frames deceit, Psalm. 50.19
and of Doeg, that his tongue devised mischief, like a sharp razor, doing
deceit, Psalm 52.2. Jeremiah says of his countrymen, that they had taught
their tongues to speak lies, and were grown Artists at it, chap. 9.5. yea, that
they had taken fast-hold of deceit, and could not be got off without striving,
chap. 8.5. But these countrymen of Job were none such, for God said, Surely
they are my people, children that will not lie, Isai. 63.8. And although every
man be a liar, either by imposture, or by impotency; yet it must be understood
that these good men aimed at truth, and intended not to deceive Job, but to
undeceive him rather. They maintained errors, but unwittingly: they charged him
also (but unjustly) with hypocrisy. Merlin.
Hence this so severe a high charge, ye are forgers of lies, such as our
Ruffians would revenge with a stab. But we must know, says one, that in those
better times it was not so harsh a business in a serious disputation to call
that a lie, which was falsely alleged by an adversary, as now-a-dayes it is in
this corrupt age of ours, wherein the greatest liars, though taken in the
manner, yet take it extreme ill to be told of their fault. Besides, in the
defense of Gods cause, and the laboring truth, plain-dealing, even with our
best friends is best: so that the Apostles rule Ephesians. 4.31. be observed, Let all
bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking be put away
from you, with all malice.

Ye are all Physicians of no value] Because you go to work upon wrong
principles, and minister mistaken physic. Physicians he acknowledges them,
and that they came with a good intent to comfort him: but for want of skill, in
stead of curing, they had well-nigh killed him, because they judged amiss of
his disease, and used corrosives in stead of cordials. By the way observe, that
Gods word is not only the food, (...) Aeschyl.
but the physic of the soul, and may far more fitly be so called, then the
library of Alexandria was of old: for as the diseases of the body are healed by
physic seasonably and rightly used: so are the distempers of the soul by
Scripture-consolations; neither shall we ever have cause to complain of them,
as Cicero did of Philosophical-comforts, nescio quomodo etc. I know not how it
comes to pass, but this I find, that the disease is too hard for the Physic:
or as the Romans did of Sylla's bloody government, that the Remedy was worse
then the Malady: how forcible are right words, said Job, chap. 6.25? And fair
words, as physicians, cure the mind distempered with passion, says the Poet.
Once. when Luther was in a great heat about something that had crossed him,
Melancthon pacified him by repeating this verse, Vince animor, tramque tuam,
qui caetera vintis.

But Jobs friends, as they were botchers of lies, so they were bunglers at
healing him: they did, says Laevater, as a Surgeon, who applies a plaster to
the hand of him whose grief is in his foot: or as that Country-Mountebank in
France, who was wont to give in writing to his patients for curing all
diseases, Becan. sum^ Theol part. 1. cap. 16.

Jeremiah; those vinebranches in Ezekiel, chap. 15.3. That idol in Saint Paul, 1
Cor. 8.4.) Jer. 13.7.
were Jobs friends to him, miserable comforters, chap. 16.2. adding to his
affliction, in stead of easing it, and pushing at him, as the whole herd of
Deer, does at that one that is wounded.

Verse 5. O that you would altogether hold your peace] Heb. In being silent,
would be silent; q. d. I thought much at your seven-dayes-silence, chap. 2.13.
and now I am no less troubled at your speeches. O that you had either
continued your silence, or else would frame to say something better then
silence: for hitherto ye have spoken much, but said little. I could heartily
wish therefore that you would now stop your mouths, and open your ears, as
verse 6. that you would be as mute as fishes, since I can hear nothing from you
but what speaks you to be mere mutes, ciphers, nullities, as verse 4.

And it should be your wisedome] For even a fool when he holds his peace is
counted wise, and he that shuts his lips is esteemed a man of understanding,
Prove. 17.28.

(...) As when the door is shut, it cannot be seen, what is within the house:
so the mouth being shut by silence, the folly that is within lies
undiscovered: and as in glasses and vessels, so in men, the sound which they
make, shows whether they be cracked or sound. An ass is known by his ears
(says the Dutch proverb) and so is a fool by his talk. As a bird is known by
his note, and a bell by his clapper, so is a man by his discourse. Plutarch
tells us, that Megabysus a Noble man of Persia, Plut. de tranque.
coming into Apelles the Painters workhouse, took upon him to speak something
there concerning the art of painting and limning, but he did it so absurdly,
that the prentices jeared him, and the master could not bear with him.

Verse 6. Hear now my reasoning etc.] Or, hear, I pray you. Be swift to hear,
slow to speak, slow to wrath: suffer the words of exhortation, and of
reprehension: sharp though it be, and to the flesh irksome, yet suffer it, since
it is for your good. Quintilian testifies of Vespasian, that he was
patientissimus very, one that could well endure to be told the truth: but there
are few Vespasians. Many people are like the nettle, touch it never so gently,
it will sting you.

And hearken to the pleadings of my lips] Heb. The contention of my lips, see
that you not only hear, but hearken to it with attention of body, intention of
mind, and retention of memory: neither God nor man can bear it, to speak, and
not be heard. See that ye refuse not him that speaks etc. Heb. 12.25. See
that ye slight not, shift not off Christ speaking to you in his Ministers and
messengers: for if they escaped not who refused him that speak on earth, much
more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven.

Verse 7. Will ye speak wickedly for God?] Ought ye to defend Gods justice by
unjustly accusing me? Or must ye needs so free him from injustice, that ye must
charge me with hypocrisy? Job had before called them, Physicians of no value;
here he compares them to Lawyers of no conscience, that care not what they
plead, so they may carry the cause for their client. But the Lord needs no
such advocates; he so loves truth, that he will not borrow patronage to his
cause from falsehood: he so hates flattery (though it be of himself) that he
has threatened to cut off all flattering lips, Psalm 12.3. and would one day
say as much to Jobs friends, notwithstanding their pretended zeal for his
glory, as once Alexander the great did to Aristobulus the Historian, who
presented him with a flattering piece concerning his own worthy acts, which he
extolled above measure: he cast the book into the river Hydaspes, and told the
Author he could find in his heart to cast him after it.

And talk deceitfully for him] To talk for God is our duty: it is to make our
tongue our glory: but to talk deceitfully for him, to seek to help his truth by
our lie, (the Vulgar here has it, Needs God your lie?) that is altogether
unlawful: for shall we do evil that good may come thereof? God forbid, Romans
3.8. And yet the Papists do so familiarly, and think they therein do God good
service: as when they deny his provident hand in ordering the disorders of the
world to his own glory, lest they should make him the Author of sin: so they
think to defend his justice by teaching predestination according to foreseen
works, by ascribing to man free will, righteousness of works, merit etc. So
their doctrine of Equivocation for the relief of persecuted Catholics, Spec.
hist. lib. 29.
their piae frauds (as they call them) their holy hypocrisy to draw infidels
to the embracing of the faith, and to the love of virtue; their lying legends,
made, say they, for good intention, that the common people might with greater
zeal serve God and his Saints; and especially, to draw the women to good order,
being by nature facile and credulous, addicted to novelties and miracles.

Verse 8. Will ye accept his person?] Whilst you think to gratify him, and to
ingratiate with him by oppressing me? Can you find no other way of justifying
Gods proceedings, then by condemning me for wicked, because by him so
afflicted? The truth is, these friends of Job out of a perverse zeal of
advancing Gods righteousness, unrighteously suspected poor Job of wickedness,
and so rejected his person, to accept Gods. See the like done Isa. 66.5. Jer.
50.7. John 16.2. O sancta simplicitas! said John Hus, when at the stake, he
observed a plain country-fellow busier then the rest in fetching fagots to burn
the heretics.

Will ye contend for God?] Why not? Good blood will not belie it self: the love
of God constrains his people to stand to him, and to stickle for him: Non
amat, qui non zelat, says a Father. But then it must be a zeal according to
knowledge: for else it will appear to be but base and reprobate metal, such as
though it seems to be all for God, yet it never received the image and
impresse of Gods holy spirit, and therefore is not current in heaven. But that
I believe and know (said that fiery Friar Brusierd in a conference with Bilney)
that God and all his Saints whom thou have so greatly dishonored, Acts and
Mon. 914.
will take revengement everlasting on thee; I would surely with these nails of
mine be thy death. Another Friar preaching at Antwerp, wished that Luther were
there, Erasm. Epist. lib. 16.
that he might bite out his throat with his teeth, and with the same teeth
receive the Eucharist by Luther so dishonored.

Verse 9. Is it good thas he should search you out etc?] q. d. Could you have
any joy of such a search? Will not all your warpings and partialities, your
colloguing and sinisterity be laid open to your loss and shame? Will not God
reprove in stead of approving you in that which ye have said for him, but all
against me? The time will come, when God will surely search out all
controversies, that they all may be ashamed who under a pretent of religion and
right, have spoken false things, and subverted the faith of some. See 1 Cor.
3.17.

Or as one man mocketh another, will ye so mock him?] Be not deceived: God is
not mocked, deluded, beguiled, as clients are by their corrupt lawyers: as
patients are by their cogging quack-salvers. Sorry man may be mocked, and made
to believe lies, as 2 Samuel 15.11. Acts 8.9, 10. and Rev. 13.3. all the world
wondered after the Beast. Judges, and other wise men, are shamefully out
other-whiles, deceiving, and being deceived: Not so the All-wise God. They that
would mock him, imposturam faciunt and patiuntur, as the Emperor said of him
that sold glass for pearls; they deceive not God, but themselves. Neither may
they conceit that their good intentions will bear them out (as Merlin here
notes) any more then it did these contenders for God, who little thought of
mocking him. A bad aim makes a good action had, as we see in Jehu; but a good
aim makes not a bad action good, as we see in Vzzah, and here.

Verse 10. He will surely reprove you] That Is all the thank you are like to
have from God; your work in pleading for him so stoutly, though it be
materially good, yet it will never prove so formally and eventually, because
you so confidently determine of things you understand not, but only by a light
conjecture. You do secretly, that is, cunningly and deceitfully accept persons,
that is, Gods own person, whilst ye wrong me for his sake, and under a pretense
of doing him right, condemn me for a wicked hypocrite, whom till thus
afflicted, you ever counted honest and upright. This the righteous Judge, who
loves judgment, and hates robbery for a burnt-offering, Isai. 61.8. will at
no hand endure. No, but he will certainly reprove you* argu^ndo arguet, he will
surely and severely blame and punish you. Carry it never so cleanly, cover in
never so closely; God who sees in secret will reprove you openly; that is, he
will chide you, smite you, curse you for it (if Repentance interpose not to
take up the matter). he will so set it on, as no creature shall be able to take
it off. Men reprove offenders sometimes slighty and overtly, deest ignis, as
Latimer said, whereby they do more harm then good; for their reproofs are
rather soothings then reprovings. Personatae reprehensiones frigent: such was
that of Eli to his sons, Junius.
1 Samuel 2.23. Such also was that of Jehoshaphat to wicked Ahab, Let not the
King say so. But when God took those same men to do, he handled them after
another manner: 1 Kings 22.8.
he gives it them both by words and blows, till both their ears tingled, till
their hearts aked, and quaked within them: so fearful a thing it is to fall
into the punishing hands of the living God. Let all those look to it,
especially that are in place of judicature, Psalm 82.1, 2, 3. Let them hear
causes without prejudicate impiety, judiciously examine them without sinister
obliquity, and sincerely judge them without unjust partiality, remembering that
Acceptatio personarum est judiciorum pestis, accepting of persons is the pest
of judgments.

Verse 11. Shall not his excellency make you afraid?] Heb. His highness, his
Majesty, his surpassing sublimity and transcendent glory; shall not this
affright you, and reine you in from wrong-dealing and warping? Who would not
fear thee o King of Nations? for to thee does it appertain, Jer. 10.7. And Fear
ye not me, says the Lord? will ye not tremble at my presence, Jer. 5.22. If an
earthly King be so dread a Sovereign: if the glory of Angels has so terrified
the best Saints on earth, that they could hardly outlive such an apparition;
what shall we think of the great and terrible God, as he is called, Nehem. 1.5.
the first motion of whose anger shall put men into disorder, and the
brightness of his offended Majesty strike their spirits with astonishment? It
is reported of Augustus the Emperor, and likewise of Tamberlane that warlike
Scythian, that in their eyes sat such a rare Majesty, Turk. hist. 236 and 415.
as a man could hardly endure to behold them without closing of his own; and
many in talking with them, and often beholding of them, have become dumb. Now
the Lord of glory as far outshineth any mortal wight, as the Sun in his
strength does a clod of clay: Jer. 17.17.
and this made Job cry out, chap. 9.34. Let not his fear terrify me: Be not
thou a terror to me, o Lord, says holy Jeremiah: and the Lord most high is
terrible, says David, Psalm. 47.2. Most high he is, and therefore terrible.

And his dread fall upon you] Some read the whole verse thus, Shall not this
acceptance of him make you afraid, seeing his dread will fall upon you? q. d.
Let the sense of your sin, and the fear of his wrath ready to seize upon
you, deter you from passing an unrighteous sentence, and from harboring such
low conceits of God.

Verse 12. Your remembrances are like unto ashes, etc] Mr. Beza reads the
whole verse thus, Your speeches are the words of ashes, and your stately
bulwarks are but bulwark of clay: And thus he paraphraseth, For these things
which you alledg as matters gathered by long observation, and which you thunder
out against me as if they were most certain and grounded axioms, are indeed no
more sound and substantial then ashes; and those your high forts, as it were,
and turrets, out of which you assail me, are made but of dirt and mire.
Others, by Your remembrances, understand with Mercer, quicquid in vobis
memorabile est, whatsoever it is, for the which you are so often remembered and
mentioned by others, as your wealth, dignity, power, splendour, name, and fame,
yea, your very life is nothing else but ashes, and all shall return to ashes,
and come to naught, according to that of Abraham, I am but dust and ashes,
Genes. 18.29. such an infinite distance there is betwixt Gods unconceiveable
Highness, and your extreme meandness, or rather, utter nothingnesse.

Your bodies to bodies of clay] i. e. To images made of clay, or earth: Or that
which is highest in you, even your best enjoyments, your chiefest eminencies,
or greatest elevations are like to a lump of clay, terrae quam terimus, terrae
quam gerimus. See Job 4.19. with the Note.

Verse 13. Hold your peace, let me alone etc.] This he had requested of them
before, verse 5. and now having nipt them on the crown by these rebating
arguments, he calls upon them again for silence and audience; which he now
requesteth not, but requires; and the rather happily, because they began to take
him off, as fearing lest by his unadvised expressions he should provoke the
Lord to lay yet more load upon him. Wherefore he adds,

And let come on me what will] That is, At my peril be it, take you no thought:
let all the trouble that may ensue be on my score, I will be accountable for it
to God, who, I hope, will be more favorable to me, then you: Interim non sine
stomacho hoc dicit, says Mercer. This Job speaks not without some heat, yet
not as one desperate, but rather resolute; for he feared no hurt from God.

Verse 14. Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth?] q. d. Do ye think, o my
friends, that I am in a fit of spiritual frenzy, and so far out of my wits,
that tearing as it were, my flesh with mine own hands; I mean, to use any
cruelty toward my self, Vatab.
and willingly to betray mine own life? Non sum ita crudelis, ut totus perdi
velier, I am not yet so cruel to my self (whatever you may gather by my
complaints and outcries) as utterly to cast away my confidence, and all care
of my life and soul. See 1 Samuel 19.5. To despair in part, and for a time, may
befall a godly man. See Mr. Perkins his discourse of spiritual desertion, where
he remembers that Luther lay (after his conversion) three days in
desperation. And the like is recorded of Mr. Rob. Bolton. Psalm. 119.109. Aliqui
suspicantur Jobum respondentem, etc. Pineda.
But of any good man that destroyed himself, we read not. David's life was in
his hand continually (and he in daily danger of losing it) yet have I not
forgotten thy law (says he) which flatly forbids all the degrees of
self-murder, as the worst sort. That Satan tempted Job to this sin, some do
probably collect from this text. A man is to expect, if he live but his days
(says a Reverend Casuist) to be urged to all sins, to the breach of every
branch of the ten Commandments, and to be put to it in respect of every Article
of our Creed.

Verse 15. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him] Though he should
multiply my miseries, and lay stroke after stroke upon me till he had dashed
the very breath out of my body, yet he shall not be so rid of me; for I will
hang on still; and if I must needs die, I will die at his feet, and in the midst
of death expect a better life from him. Dum expiro spero, shall be my motto:
The righteous has hope in his death, Prove. 14.32. yea, his hope is most
lively, when himself lies a dying, superest sperare salutem, my flesh, and my
heart fails, says he; but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion
for ever, Psalm 73.26. True faith in a danger (as the blood) gets to the heart,
John 14.1. and if it self be in good heart, it will believe in an angry God, as
Isai. 63.15, 16. (the Church there thought she should know him amidst all his
austerities) yea, in a killing God, as here: yea, (as a man may say with
reverence) whether God will or no, as that woman of Canaan Matthew. 15. who would
not be damped or discouraged with Christ's either silence, or sad answers; and
therefore had what she came for, besides an high commendation of her heroical
faith.

But (or nevertheless) I will maintain mine own ways before him] We have had
the Triumph of Jobs trust: here we have the ground of it, viz. his
uprightness, the testimony of his conscience, that in simplicity and godly
sincerity he had his conversation in the world, 2 Cor. 2.12. This was his
cordial, without which, grief would have broke his heart, Psalm 69.20. this was
his confidence, even the clearness of his conscience, 1 John 3.21.
Uprightness has boldness; and that man who walks uprightly before God, may
trust perfectly in God. Job was either innocent or penitent: He would therefore
either maintain his ways before God, and come to the light, Quem poenitet
peccasse, pene est innocens. Sen. Agam.
that his deeds might be manifest, that they were wrought in God, John 3.21. Or
else he would reprove and correct his ways (so the Hebrew word signifies
also) that is, he would confess and forsake his sins, and so be sure to have
mercy, according to that soul-satisfying promise, Prove. 28.13.

Verse 16. He also shall be my salvation] So long as I judge my self, God will
not judge me, 1 Cor. 11.33. Nay, he will surely save me; for God will save the
humble person, Job 22.29. Merlin. in loc.
what is humiliation, but humility exercised? Non est igitur inanis electorum
fides res evanida nec infirma. says an Interpreter here: therefore the faith
of Gods elect is no empty or vain thing, but a light shining from the spirit of
God, and such as overcomes the very darkness of death. It is a sure testimony
of Gods good will toward us, and an infallible persuasion of our salvation,
such as slighteth the worlds false censures, overcomes temptations of all
sorts, laugheth at death, and through the thickest darkness of affliction
beholds the pleased face of God in Christ, through whom we have boldness and
access with confidence by the faith of him, Ephesians. 2.12.

For an hypocrite shall not come before him] No, that is a privilege proper to
the Communion of Saints: therefore I am no hypocrite (as you have charged me to
be, chap. 4.6. and 8.13.) for I dare both offer to maintain my ways before
him to be upright for the maine, and I doubt not but he will be my salvation,
and that I shall appear before him in heaven; this no hypocrite shall ever do.
How should he (say) when as he is an unclean caytiffe, as the Hebrew word
signifies, flagitiosus (so Vatablus renders it) a flagitious, impious person,
a very juggle (so the Septuagint) a fair professor indeed, but a foul sinner,
Caneph. Corant Deo dolus non ingreditur.
moyled all over, and even buried in a bog of wickedness: he is a wicked man
in a godly man's clothes, says one. He does but assume religion, says another,
as the devils do dead bodies without a soul to animate them. He is like the
painted grapes that deceived the living birds; or the golden apples with this
motto, No further then colors; touch them, and they vanish. He knows that he
is naught* and that God knows it too: how then should he approach him, or
appear before his throne? No, he dare not, for the very show of his face does
testify against him, as the Prophet speaks in another case: or if he do, he
shall not be able to subsist there, Psalm 5.5. he shall not stand in judgment,
Psalm 1.5. but shall run away with these or the like words in his mouth, Who
amongst us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who amongst us shall dwell with
everlasting burnings, Isai. 33.14? Woe unto us, who shall deliver us out of the
hands of this mighty God, 1 Samuel 4.8? None, Mat. 24.51.
for he shall surely assign you a part with the devil and hypocrites; when as
the righteous shall give thanks unto Gods Name, and the upright only shall
dwell in his presence, Psalm. 140.13.

Verse 17. Hear diligently my speech] Heb. Hearing heart, that is, incline your
ears and hear, as Isai. 55.3. Mark and attend; hear me not only, but heed me
too: interrupt me not, neither give me the slip, as it may seem they were ready
to do, when they heard him profess such a deal of faith and hope under so many
and heavy afflictions; wherein they thought that either he was besides himself,
or at least besides the cushion, as we say, and utterly out. See verse 6. and
observe, that it is but needful often to stir up our auditors to attention.
Job makes more prefaces then one to be heard; so do the Prophets often, Hear
the word of the Lord, Hear and give ear, be not proud, for the Lord has spoken
it. So does the Arch-prophet more then once, Revel. 2. and 3. And Matthew. 13.19.
Who has ears to hear, let him hear. All Christ's hearers had not ears, or if
they had, yet they were stopped; or if open, yet the bore was not big enough. O
pray that God would say unto us Epphata, be opened, for a heavy ear is a
singular judgment.

Verse 18. Behold, now I have ordered my cause] Heb. my judgment: He had
spoken before of his Declaration, which is conceived to be a Law-term; for in
lawsuits, the Plaintiff puts in a declaration of his grievance. Job had his
declaration ready drawn, and craved audience: he asks afterward, Who will
plead with me? and here in the like language he tells us, that he had ordered
his cause, he had marshalled and methodized his arguments, he had set and
stated the controversy. Lo, here I stand ready prepared to plead, and am
confident I shall prevail.

I know that I shall be justified] That is, I am persuaded, or I am sure (as
Romans 8.38.) I believe and I know, as John 6.59. sc. with a fiducial knowledge,
that I shall be justified, sc. from my sins, by Christ's righteousness imputed
(yea, that I am so already; and that for ever: for Peccata non redeunt,
discharges in justification are not repealed or called in again) and that I
shall depart from Gods bar acquitted in this particular controversy. And so he
did; for God justified Job, and reproved his three friends, chap. 42.

Verse 19. Who is he that will plead with me?] Of my justification in both
respects I am so confident, that I dare encounter any that shall deny it: Who
is he? and where is he that shall lay any thing to my charge, since it is God
that justifies, Romans 8.33? Having ordered my cause, and cleared my conscience
by confession, and self-judging, and now being justified by faith, I can cast
down the gauntlet to all comers, and Goliah-like, call for an opposite to
grapple with: in the name of the Lord of hosts I will undertake him, and am
sure to come more off then a conqueror, even a Triumpher, 2 Cor. 2.14. there
being not any one condemnation (neither from God, nor the devil, from the law,
sin, or death) to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh,
but after the spirit, as Job did, Romans 8.1.33. Here he challenges all the
world, says Gregory, if they could, to accuse him for any thing outwardly done
amiss by him. And herein if none could tax him; there was nothing but evil
cogitations in his heart, of which he could be guilty: but for these, from
which none can be free, he held not his peace, but spoke and complained
internally hereof to God by reproving his own ways: and if he should have been
silent, and not speak hereof, and bewail them, he should die and perish: for so
he reads the following words, according to the Vulgar translation.

For now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost] Vulg. Wherefore being
silent I am consumed. Broughton, If now I speak not, I should starve. The
Hebrew is, for now I shall-be silent and die, q. d. My passion must have a
vent, or else it will make an end of me (as chap. 7.11.) so tormented I am with
these aspersions of my friends, that I know not how to live, unless I may wipe
them off; or at least, unless I pour out my soul into Gods blessed bosom.

Verse 20. Only do not two things unto me] Accord me only two conditions, and
then I will not fly the combat: he knew he might have any thing of God that
was fit and lawful to be asked. When poor men make requests to Princes, they
usually answer them as the Echo does the voice, the answer cuts off half the
petition, and if they beg two boons at once, they may be glad that they get
one. But God deals by his servants and suppliants not only as the Prophet did
by the Shunamite (when he bad her ask what she needed, and promised her a son,
which she most desired, and yet through modesty asked not, 1 King. 4.16.) but
also as Naaman did by Gehezi, when asking one talent, he forced him to take
two. This Job well knew, and therefore he beggeth two things at once; but
better he had begged that one thing necessary, Patience; or if two, that best
use of his present sufferings. As we read of one good man, Mr. Leigh his Saints
encouragement etc. page 164. Dr. Halls Rem. of profaneness. p. 143.
that lying under great torments of the Stone, he would often cry out while
his friends melted with compassion toward him, The use, Lord, the use: And of
Mr. William Perkins, that when he lay in his last and killing torment of the
stone, hearing the bystanders pray for a mitigation of his pain, he willed
them not to pray for an case of his complaint, but for an increase of his
patience: Thus if Job had done, he had done better: but by what he does here,
we may easily gather, that he expected no freedom from his misery, but from God
alone: and that he was wont familiarly to impart to God all the thoughts and
actings of his heart: and lastly, that he acknowledged him to be a most
righteous Judge, who would not deal with his people upon unequal conditions,
but give them a fair trial.

Then will I not hide my self from thee] i. e. I shall have no cause, either
through fear or shame to hide my self. It is not safe for a man to indent with
God, and make a bargain with him: for so one may have the thing he would have,
but better be without it; as those workmen Matthew. 20. who bargained for a penny
a day, and yet when they had it, were no whit contented. Socrates thought it
was not fit to ask of God any more then this, that he would bestow good things
upon us; but what, and how much, to leave that to him, not being over-earnest,
or presuming to prescribe ought. Sir Thomas Moors wife was mightily desirous of
a boy (that was her word) and she had one that proved a fool; and says her
husband, you were never quiet till you had a Boy, and now you have one that
will be all his life a Boy. But what were those two things that Job was so
earnest for?

Verse 21. Withdraw thy hand far from me, and let not etc.] Neither afflict
me, nor affright me. See the same request chap. 9.34. and granted by God, chap.
38.3. and 40.7. They must be very sorry prayers indeed that God will not hear,
if they come from honest hearts, Psalm 31.22. I said in my haste, I am cut off
from before thine eyes: Nevertheless thou heardst the voice of my
supplications when I cried unto thee. For the sense of this whole verse, see
the Notes on chap. 9.34.

And let not thy dread make me afraid] Appear not unto me in thy Majesty, but
in thy mercy: come not upon me in such a terrifical manner, as through
astonishment at thy surpassing glory to kill me, for who can see thy face and
live? Surely as the sight of the eye is dazeled with the Sun, or a crystal
glass broken with the fire; so there is so much dread in the face of God, that
the best cannot behold it. Destruction from God was a terror to me, and by
reason of his highness I could not endure, Job 31.23.

Verse 22. Then call thou, and I will answer etc.] Here Job gives God his
choice, offering to be either Defendant or Plaintiff; Respondent or Opponent:
Hoc multum erat, says Lavater, this was much, and indeed too much: for if God
should enter into judgment with his best servants, no man living should be
justified in his sight; Psalm 143.2. The best may bear a part in that song of
mercy, Asperge me Domine, purge me with hysop, and I shall be clean; wash me,
etc. Psalm 51.7. Job is confident of his innocence, and he might be for that
particular wherewith his friends charged him ( viz. that he was an hypocrite)
but yet in defending himself, and charging God so highly, as he does in this
and the next Chapter, he cannot be excused; what though he knew himself
justified by Christ's righteousness, imputed according to the Covenant of
Grace; Omnino tamen semper est Job immodicus, says Merce^ here, yet surely, he
passes the bounds of moderation, and is over-bold in this offer of his, laying
the reins in the neck of his passions, Fertur equis auriga etc. Cajetan says,
these words are arrogant and scandalous; and Eliphaz is supposed for this
passage to tax Job as he did, chap. 15.4. yea, thou castest off fear.

Or, let me speak and answer thou me] i. e. I will be plaintiff or Opponent, I
will be bold to say, it is not seemly to handle him as an enemy, who knows
nothing by himself. If there be any thing more then involuntary and
unavoidable infirmity in me; Show me what, and how many my sins are, that
require so many and great punishments.

Verse 23. How many are men's iniquities and sins] How many? too many to be
reckoned: Sin imputed to thee, sins inherent in thee, sins issuing from thee;
commissions, omissions, failings in the manner of performance (for a good work
may be marred in the doing, as many a garment is in the making, and many a tale
in the telling) thy life is fuller of sins, then the firmament is of stars, or
the furnace of sparks, besides thy birth-blot and inward evils which might
justly cause thy destruction, as a man may die of inward bleeding. When the
house is well swept, and all rooms seem very clean, if the Sun do but shine
into it through the windows, the beams thereof discover an infinite number of
motes in all places: so will it be with the best, if narrowly examined. Lesser
sins, secret faults, are of daily, and almost hourly incursion; yet we must be
cleansed from them, Psalm 19.12. or else vae hominum vitae quantumvis
laudibili, says one, Woe to the life of men, though praiseworthy, as the world
judges. A pardon there is of course for such sins, and they do not usually
distract and plunge the conscience: but yet that pardon must be sued out, and
those sins must be disliked and bewailed.

Make me to know my transgression and my sin] That particular sin that thou
chiefly strikest at: for every affliction has a voice in it, Mic. 6.9. and
says to the sufferer, as those mariners did to Jonas, chap. 1.8. what evil
have thou committed or admitted? what good have thou omitted, or intermitted?
Up and search; Israel has sinned: why lie thou upon thy face, as the Lord
once said to Joshua, chap. 7.10, 11? something surely there is amiss that God
would have amended: It is therefore meet to be said unto him, Make me to know
my transgression and my sin, yea, the iniquity of my sin, the filthiness of my
lewdness, all my transgressions in all my sins (as the phrase is Lev. 16.21.)
that is, how many transgressions are wrapped up in my several sins, and their
circumstances. This either Job meant here, or else he was afterward by Elihu
tutored to it, chap. 34.31, 32. Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have
born chastisement, I will not offend any more. That which I see not, teach thou
me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.

Verse 24. Wherefore hidest thou thy face?] Who wast wont to shine upon me,
chap. 29.2, 3. He that hides his face, shows, that he neither pitieth, nor
purposes to relieve. God seemed to look upon Job no otherwise then as under
Satan's cloak, said that Martyr. But he hides his love sometimes out of
increasement of love, as Joseph did to his brethren; and is never so near us,
as when with Mary Magdalen, we are so bleared with tears for his absence, that
we cannot see him, though at hand. A child of light may walk in darkness,
Isai. 50.10. which when he does, he must resolve, as Isai. 8.17. I will wait
upon the Lord who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for
him: he must also in that dark condition cast anchor, as they did in the
shipwreck, Acts 2.7. and pray still for day, waiting till the day star arise in
their hearts, and all clear up.

And hold me for thine enemy?] Which if God should have done indeed, it
would have been wide with Job, and far worse then ever yet it had been; for if
a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away, 1 Samuel 24.19? I trow not,
unless it be for a greater mischief at another time. But Job was out when he
judged himself hated of God, because afflicted, since he scourges every son
whom he receives, Heb. 12.5. See my Love Tokens, page 23. and 54.

Verse 25. Indignum est majestate tua, ut misellum homuncionem etc. Jun.
Will thou break a leaf driven to and fro etc?] q. d. egregiam vero laudem;
Think thou to get any honor by encountering and overturning me, who was at
my best but as a leaf, or as stubble, weak, and worthless; and am now, by
reason of mine afflictions, but as a leaf blown off, and whirled up and down;
or as stubble fully dried, which is soon scattered by the wind, Psalm 1.4. or
quickly burnt by the fire, Nah. 1.10. David reasons in this manner with Saul,
1 Samuel 24.14. After whom is the King of Israel come forth? after whom do thou
pursue? Tibul.
After a dead dog? after a flea? A great purchase surely! a great victory!

-- An gloria tanta est
Insidias homini supposuisse Deum?
The truth is, God does not afflict any man (whom he knows to be a thing of
nothing) on purpose to try his strength, or to show his power; but either to
exercise his justice upon the wicked, or to prove the faith of his people, and
to promote their salvation.

Verse 26. For thou writest bitter things against me] As it were by a judicial
rescript thou decreest my doom; and accordingly thou inflictest hard and heavy
things upon me, Humanitus dictum ex usu forensi. Jun.
as is most elegantly described in the following verses by metaphors fetched
from the course of Courts. Sin is an evil, and a bitter thing, Jer. 2.19. Heb.
12.15. Acts 8.23, and has bitter effects, Ruth. 1.20. Exodus 1.14. This made
that holy man Mr. Paul Baine, say: the sweet ways of my youth did breed such
worms in my soul, Bains letters.
as that my heavenly Father will have me yet a little while continue my bitter
worm-seed, because they cannot otherwise be thoroughly killed. I thank God
(says he in another place) sustentation I have, but suavities spiritual I
taste not any. Mr. Clark in his life.
It is reported of this good man, that when he came first to Cambridg, his
conversation was so irregular, that his father being grieved at it, before his
death left with a friend forty pounds by the year, desiring that his son might
have it if he amended his manners, else not: he afterward had it, as he well
deserved, as proving a notable instrument of much good to many, and
particularly to that Reverend Dr. Sibbs whom he converted; Howbeit in his last
sickness he had many fears and doubts, and God letting Satan loose upon him,
he went out of this world with far less comfort then many weaker Christians
enjoy; his case being not unlike his, who says in the next words,

And make me to possess (or to inherit) the iniquities of my youth] Which I
took for pard oned long since (and so no doubt but they were); but Jobs
affliction renewed the remembrance of them to his conscience (as it is the best
art of memory.) Satan also made him believe, that now he was punished for the
new and the old, as we say, and that God meant to make him answer for all the
sins of his life at once, having watched a time to be revenged on him for all
together. Youth is a slippery age, and soon slips into sin. There is great
cause that a young man should cleanse his ways, Psalm 119.9. where the word
Nagnar (signifying a lad, or stripling) comes from a root signifying to shake
off, or to be tossed to and fre. And the other word rendered cleanse, signifies
to be clean as glass, which will soon gather a new dustinesse. Such must
cleanse their ways by cleaving to the word: or otherwise, they may one day
groan as much under the sins then committed, as many do under the blows and
bruises then received. See the former Note.

Verse 27. Thou put my feet also in the stocks] Mercer here observes an
elegant gradation in Gods proceeding with Job, as himself describes it, rising
higher and higher in his discourse. 1. God hid his face, and denied him his
favor. 2. He counted him as his enemy. 3. He broke him like a leaf or
stubble. 4. He wrote bitter things against him. 5. He made him possess the
sins of his youth. 6. For his young sins he claps him up close prisoner now in
his old age, and there keeps him as with a strict guard following him close at
heels, if he but stir a foot; was there ever sorrow like unto Jobs sorrow?
was ever greater severity and rigor showed upon any godly person? Where then
shall the ungodly and the sinner appear etc? Gods wrath is like Eliah's cloud,
little at first, as a man's hand, but soon after very dismal and dreadful; or as
thunder, of which we hear at first a little noise afar off, but soon after a
terrible crack. Well might Moses say, Who knows the power of thine anger?
Psalm 90.19.
Cavebis auteus, si pavebis.

And look narrowly into all my paths] He says not ways, but paths. Gregory
makes this difference; Ways are larger, Paths narrower; God then is said to
look into all men's paths, when he looks not only at the evil done by them,
but at the intention of their mind, which is not so easily discerned but by him
the searcher of all hearts. And for that which follows,

Thou set a print upon the heels of my feet.] Gregory here observes, that
God looks at the hurt done to others by examples given by men's evil doings
unto them, leaving a print upon the ground, as it were, whereby others follow
them, and so their sin is in this regard made the greater: to which purpose
some sense those words Psalm 49.5. when the iniquity of my heels shall compass
me about. Others make Jobs meaning here to be, Thou followest me with continual
pursuit, as a prisoner that is dogged at heels by his keeper from place, to
place lest he should escape. Diod.
Thou followest me close, and upon the track like a hunter, Job 10.16. The
footsteps of thy wrath (says an Interpreter) are seen upon the soles of my
feet (so that from top to toe I have no free part) like as prisoners feet are
often swelled with the weight of their fetters.

Verse 28. And he as a rotten thing consumeth] Heb. waxes old. He, that is,
this poor man, this silly wretch, as David speaks of himself, Psalm. 34.6. Or,
This body of mine, as chap. 19.26. Job pointing to it, as it is like he did
there. And Paul, 1 Cor. 15.53, 54. As a rotten thing (Heb. as rottenness)
consumes. When a thing once rotteth, as an apple, flesh, etc. it soon
perishes: such is man under pressing afflictions especially.

And as a garment that is moth-eaten] The beauty whereof is defaced, and the
usefulness departed.

CHAP. XIIII. Verse 1. Man that is born of a woman etc.]
Or, THat is born about by a woman in her womb. Jobs design is here to set
forth the misery of man (whom in the last verse of the former chapter he had
compared 1. To a rotten thing. 2. To a moth-eaten garment) ab exordio ad
exodium, from his conception to his dissolution. Man, Earthly man, that is born
of a woman, Genesis 3.16.
or mannesse that weaker vessel, who both breeds, bears, and brings forth
in partu dolorosa, post partum laboriosa, every way calamitous: neither is her
babe in a better condition, but born with a cross on his back (as it is storied
of Frederick the Elector of Saxony) and having his whole life overspread with
sins and miseries, Job. Manl. los. com^
as with a filthy morphew.

Is of few dayes] Heb. short of days. Short indeed, every thing reckoned: For
1. Childhood and youth are vanity. 2. Sleep, as a publican, takes off a third
part of our time. 3. All the days of the afflicted are evil, and M^^^^ ^abet
vicer quae trabitur vit^ gemitibus; it is not a life, but a death rather that
is spent in sorrow: Aug. de civ. Dei lib. 9. c. 10.
in which regard Plotinus the Philosopher held mortality a mercy, that we may
not always be held under the miseries of this life present. 4. Scarce one of a
thousand live that little time that they are here, but woefully waste the flower
of their age, the strength of their bodies, the vigor of their spirits in
sinful pleasures, and sensual delights; and then either sit and sing all too
late and in vain, O mihi praterites ref^rat si Juppiter ann^s!

Or else complain with old Themistocles, that now they must die when they do
but begin only to be wise: the life of a wicked man runs out, as the sand in
an hourglasse that does little good: He considers not that upon this little
point of time hangs the crown of eternity; and that the very next moment, he
may be cut off from all possibility of repentance, acceptance and grace for
ever. Hence his many troubles here: all which are but typical of those
hereafter; besides the fear of death, which makes him all his life time
subject to bondage, Heb. 2.15. It were much to be wished that men would
consider their time is short, their task long, and that therefore they should
use all speed and diligence; lest (so as children have usually torn their
books) they have ended their lives before they have learned their lessons.

And full of trouble] Or, of indignation, commotion, perturbation. Those three
vultures, Fear, Anger, Grief, are frequently feeding upon his heart whiles he
is in this world; and like a ship in a storm, he is tossed much, but saileth
little or nothing. Few and evil are the days of my pilgrimage, says good old
Jacob, Genesis 47.9. Th^tis ap. Hom. Iliad.
And she in the Poet could say as much of her son Achilles.

(...)
(...) --
Verse 2. He comes forth like a flower] What he had asserted concerning the
shortness of man's life is here illustrated by two elegant similitudes
frequently used, not in Scripture only, Isa. 28.1. and 40.6. Jam. 1.10, 11. 1
Pet. 1.24.
but in Heathen Authors, as were easy to instance. A flower has a spring and
a fall: so have men their times and their turns; their rise, and their ruin.
Why, and how man in his flourish is like to a flower, See Psalm. 103.15, 16.
where he is compared to a flower of the field (which lies open to all
inconveniences) not of the garden, which is much sheltered from sharp winds,
fenced from the teeth and feet of beasts, from the hands of children,
strangers, etc.

And is cut down] Heb. cut round, or circumcised, sc, by some nipping or
blasting wind, such as that East Wind, Genesis 41.23. or some cropping hand, or
its own fading nature, and then it is not, says David, Psalm 103.16. that is,
it neither continues any longer in being, nor returns any more into being: no
more does man, though in his time never so flourishing.

He flees also] With post-baste, as one that flees for life; so does he from
life, every moment yiedling somewhat unto death: Orimur, morimur, finisque ab
origire pendet; Life, as fast as it increases, decreaseth. It is improper,
says one, to ask when we shall dye, but rather when we shall make an end of
dying?

As a shadow] As the shadow of a dial: our lives are continually hasting to
their period, and never make stop. By these, and many the like comparisons
(common in this book, and other Scriptures) we see how much God desires that
we should mind our mortality: too blame then are those who have one leg in the
grave, and the other in hell, and yet do put far away thoughts of death, and
under gray hairs nourish green hopes and desires: neither may young men be
excused who bind upon long life, Vitae summa brevis spem ne^ vetat inchoare
longam.
and boast of to morrow, Prove. 27.1. since they know not what a great-bellied
day may bringforth. The Jews have a proverb, that many times old camels carry
young camels skins to the market. And how often see we elder folk carry young
men's and childrens bodies to the graves?

And continues not] Heb. stands not, as a pillar, but vanishes as a shadow,
yea, Hor. lib. 1. corm. 4. (...). Pindar.
as a dream of a shadow, as the Greek Poet has it. The Vulgar translateth, He
continues not in the same state. To have no shadow of turning, notes the
perfection of God, Jam. 1.17.

Verse 3. And do thou open thine eyes upon such a one?] sc. to observe his
faults strictly, and to punish him for the same severely? does this become so
great a Majesty? This Job speaks non citra stomachum, not without stomach, as
forgetting himself through impatiency, says Mercer, and seeking to ease
himself any way of the pains and colors he sustained, being carried out of
himself by his unruly passions. By this question Job does nontam admirari quum
arguere, says Brentius; not so much wonder, as warble with God, that he should
care for so poor a creature, whom it might beseem him rather to contemn. But
Job should have remembered, that God opens his eyes upon man, not to punish
him only, but to help and relieve him, Psalm 31.15. And at another time Job
could set it upon the score of Gods favors to man that he visits him every
morning ( viz. by his fatherly chastisements) and tries him every moment,
chap. 7.17, 18.

And bring me into judgment with thee] Poor me. who am (...), Me gravissimit
tuis judiciis extra ordinem divexas. Merl.
thrice a man: that is, most miserable, even me thou questionest in the rigor
of thy righteous judgment. See a like expostulation, Psalm 89. and all to move
God to compassion. Our frailty is a good pleadable argument to this purpose.

Verse 4. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.] q. d. I
confess I am unclean: but what can I do withal? or how can I do otherwise, since
I do but my kind? But was this a sufficient plea? David was of another mind,
when he alleged this as a great aggravation of his blood-guiltinesse, Behold,
I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me, Psalm 51.5. q.
d. I have not only fallen into these foul sins, but I have done it out of the
venemousnesse and vitiosity of my nature, commonly called original, and by the
Apostle inhabiting sin, Romans 7.17. as by the Schools peccatum peccans, the
sinning sin, as that which is the source and seminary of all actual
disobediences. And because this uncleanness is natural to us, therefore it
makes us as loathsome to God, as a toad is to us, because poison is in the
nature of it. Papists say, (but not truly) that Original sin is the smallest of
all sins, not deserving any more of Gods wrath then only a want of his
beatifical presence; and that too without any pain or sorrow of mind from the
apprehension of so great a loss. They hold also those motions of the heart not
consented to, to be no sins, but necessary conditions, arising from our
constitution, and such as Adam had in his innocence. Contrary-wise, Job here
grants a birth-blot upon all, and lays his hand upon it as the cause of the
length of men's troubles, and shortness of their lives: only he forgets
himself (says Mercer here) when he pleads that he should rather be
pitied, then thus sharply punished, (...). Ethic. lib. 3. cap. 5.
because he was naturally inclined to sin, and cannot avoid it. For as
Aristotle says of drunkards, that they deserve double punishments; first, for
their drunkenness, and then for the sin committed in and by their
drunkenness: so do all men deserve double damnation; first, for the corruption
of Nature (signified by those legal pollutions, by bodily issues) and then for
the cursed effects of it, Genesis 6.5. Romans 7.8. But it may be Job here had an
eye to that promise made to Noah after the flood, Genesis 8.21. where the Lord
moves himself to mercy by consideration of man's native corruption, even from
his childhood, for he knows our frame etc. Psalm 103.14. that is (as the
Chaldee Paraphrast explaineth it) he knows our evil figment or thought which
impelleth to sin: he knows it, and weighs it. See the like Isa. 48.8, 9.
We may beseech the Lord to spare us when we act sin, because our natures are
sinful: but let not any go about either to palliate or extenuate their acts of
sin by the sinfulness of their natures; as those do, who being told of their
evil pranks and practices, plead for them, saying, We are flesh and blood, etc.

Not one] Fortes creantur fortibus and bonis; but no mere man can bring forth a
clean child out of unclean seed. Adam begat a son after his own image ( Genesis
5.3.) Corruptus corruptum, That which is of the flesh is flesh, John 3. Sin is
propagated, and proceeds from the union of body and soul into one man. That
phrase Warmedin sin, Psalm 51.5. is meant of the preparation of the body, as
an instrument of evil, which is not so actually till the soul come. But we
should not be so inquisitive how sin came in, as how to be rid of it; like as
when a fire is kindled in a city, all men are more careful to quench it, then
to question where, and how it began. Now there is one only way of ridding our
hearts of sin, viz. to run to Christ, and to believe in him: For if the Son
make you free, ye shall (...) indeed: and hereunto, both the Chaldee Paraphrast
had respect (likely) when he rendered this text, Cannot One? that is, Cannot
God? As also the Vulgar Latin, Nonne tu qui solus es? Can not thou alone?
sc. by thy merit and Spirit, according to that of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 6.11.

Verse 5. Seeing his days are determined etc.] God has set every man both his
time (whether shorter, called here his days, or longer, the number of his
months, they have both their bounds which none can pass) and also his task,
Acts 13.25. Hieron. ep. ad Fu.
John fulfilled his course, and in brevi vitae spatia tempora virtutum multa
replevit, and he lived long in a little space; he wrought hard, as not willing
to be taken with his task undone. So verse 36. David, after he had served his
own generation, and had done all the will of God, fell on sleep. See more of
this on chap. 7.1.

Thou have appointed his bounds] Heb. His statutes; It is appointed for all men
once to die, Heb. 9.27. once for all, and for ever it is appointed, and this
statute is irrepealable. Here then we see the cause why some, likely to live
long, die soon, and others more infirm live longer. God has set the bounds of
each ones life to a very day. Virg.
The bounds may be passed which our natural complexion sets; the bounds
cannot be passed which the providence and will of God sets. Stat sua cuique
dies. --

Verse 6. Turn from him that he may rest] Heb. Look away from him, i. e. from
me; look not so narrowly, and with such a critical eye upon mine out-strayes,
thus to hold me still on the rack; look not so angerly, afflict me not so
heavily, but let me rest or cease from my present pressures, and doleful
complaints, and spend the span of this transitory life with some comfort, and
then let the time of my departure come when thou please.

Till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his days.] That is, says the
Gloss, till I am as willing to die, as a laboring man is to go to supper, and
to bed. The word rendered accomplish, signifies properly to acquiesce, and rest
in a thing, and vehemently to desire it. The Saints, when they die, shall rest
in their beds, Is^i. 57.2. they rest from their labors, Rev. 14.13. and that
(...) presently, straight upon the stroke of death; no sooner have they passed
under the flaming sword of that punishing Angel, but they are forthwith in
Paradise. Here they are seldom quiet, but tossed up and down as the ball upon
the racket, or ship upon the waves: and hence it is that they sometimes fret or
faint, as Job, and speak unadvisedly with their lips; these firm mountains are
moved with earthquakes, these calm seas are stirred with tempests; and truly,
whosoever has set himself to do every days work with Christian diligence, to
bear every days crosses with Christian patience, and is sensible of his
failings in both; libenter ex vita, and qunsi pleno passu egredietur, says
one, he will be full glad to be gone hence, and be as weary of his life, as
ever any hireling was of his work. See the Notes on chap. 7.1, 2.

Verse 7. For there is hope of a tree etc.] Here Job sets on his request,
verse 6. with a reason: God loves a reasonable service, and likes well that
we reverently reason it out with him. And for the literal sense, all things,
says Gregory, are so plain, that there is no need to say any thing to that, it
being no more then this; either I shall have comfort in this world before I
die, or never here: therefore grant me rest now. This argument Job illustrateth
1. By a dissimilitude here. 2. By a similitude, Merlin.
verse 11, 12. The dissimilitude betwixt a tree and a man, is this; a tree may
be hewed and felled, yet feel no pain. Again, succisa repullulat, imbribus
irrigata, a tree cut down, if well watered, will spring and sprout up again.
But now man, as he is very sensible of every stroke of Gods hand, neither can
he suffer sickness or other affliction without smart, so when once cut down by
death, he can by no means be recovered; he cannot revive without a miracle.

Verse 8. Though the roots thereof wax old in the earth] And so the more
unlikely to shoot forth again. Trees also have their old age wherein they decay.

(...). And the stock thereof die in the ground] Heb. in the dust, as it needs
must, when cut off from the root, it lies along on the earth. It was by a
miracle that Aaro^s rod flourished: not only all the plants of Gods setting,
but the very boughs cut off from the body of them, shall (...) and be fruitful.

Verse 9. Yet through the sent of water it will bud] Heb. from the smell of
waters; a sweet Metaphor, says Merlin, sense being attributed to things
senseless, as smelling to the fire, Judge. 16.9. and here to trees, which are
said to turn themselves and their roots after a sort, to take in the smell of
the water, and thereby refreshed to bud and bring forth boughs, like a plant.
This is check to those that live under the droppings of the ordinances, and yet
are like the Cypress-tre^, which the more it is watered, proves the less
fruitful, and being once out down, it never springs again: whence the Romans,
who believed not a resurrection, were wont to place a Cypresse-tree at the
threshold of the house of death, as Pliny and Ser^i^s tell us. Serve. in Virg.
l. 4. Plin. lib. 16. cap. 32.


Verse 10. But man dies and wastes away] Heb. strong and lusty man, Homo
quantumvis rooustus. Vat.
dies and wastes away, or is cut off, sc. worse then a tree, for he grows no
more, or is discomfited, vanquished, (as Exodus 17.13. and 32.18.) sc. by death,
and so carried clean out of this world.

Yea, man gives up the ghost] Homo vulgaris and plebeius; All of all sorts
must die, whether noble, or ignoble, as Rabbi Abraham here observes. Job is
very much in this discourse about death: and surely, as Nazianzen wishes of
hell, so could I of death, Vtinam ubique de morte dissereretur! oh that it were
more in men's minds and mouths then it is!

And where is he?] q. d. No where above ground; or if he be, putrefit and
teterrime olet, he putrifies and stinks filthily: and as his life is taken
away, so is his glory: yea, being once out of sight, he grows by little and
little out of mind too, little thought of, less spoken of, many times not so
much as his name mentioned or remembered in the next generation, Eccles. 1.11.
There is no remembrance of former things (or men) neither shall there be any
remembrance etc. So Eccles. 2.16. and 8.10. and 9.5. Hence the state of the
dead is called the land of forgetfulness, Psalm 88.12. And Psalm 31.12. I am
forgotten, as a dead man out of mind: Heathens also say the same. Hor. lib. 4.
Carm. 7.


Cum somel occideris, and de te splendida Minos
Fecerit arbitria,
Non, Torquate, genus, non te facundia, non te
Restituet pietas.
Verse 11. As the water fall from the sea] He sets forth the same truth by an
elegant similitude drawn from the drying up of waters. Look how these after
some exundation of the sea, or some great river, are separated and left (upon
the reflux thereof) behind the rest upon the land, which cannot return (for
then they must ascend, which is impossible to nature) nor continue, but do
utterly dry up, Sanctius Abbot.
and evaporate: So etc. verse 12. Others read it thus, As when the waters from
the feafail, the flood decaieth, and dries up: so when man's life is taken
away, it returns no more while this world lasts. God has made in the bowels
of the earth certain secret ways, passages, and veins through which water
conveigheth it self from the sea to all parts, and has its saltness taken
away in the passage. Thence are our springs, and from them our rivers: but in
hot countries, and dry seasons, springs are dry, and rivers want water
exceedingly; as at this time they do, March 7. 1653. So when natural moisture
decays in man, he fails, and dies: the radical humor, that supplement and
oil of life, is dried up, and can be no more renewed till the last day, when
yet it shall not be restored to the same state and moisture, but instead of
natural, rise spiritual, 1 Cor. 15.

Verse 12. So man lies down] sc. in the dust of death, or in the bed of the
grave; his dormitory, till the last day.

Vt somnus mortis, sic lectus imago sepulchri. And rises not] scil. To live
again among men: so Psalm 78. Man is compared to a wind, which when it is past,
returns not again. If it be objected, that we read of three in the old
Testament, and five in the new raised from death to life: besides, those many
that arose and came out of the graves after Christ's resurrection, and went into
the holy city, and appeared unto many, Matthew. 27.52, 53. It is answered, 1.
These few raised by Gods extraordinary power, do not infringe the truth of what
the Scripture here and elsewhere affirms of all mankind according to the
ordinary course of nature. 2. Even those men also afterward died again, and
vanished; no more to return or appear again in this world.

Till the heavens be no more] i. e. Never (say some interpreters) to wit, vi
sua by his own strength, and to a better condition in the land of the living:
so the word until is used, 2 Samuel 6.13. Matthew. 5.26. and 1.25. ut pie credimus.
How sound and clear Job was in the point of the Resurrection, we shall see,
chap. 19. and because he falls upon it in the words next following here, some
understand these words thus, They shall not rise till the general
resurrections, when these heavens shall be changed, and renewed, Psalm 102.25,
26. Isaiah 65.17. 2 Peter 3.7.10, 11. Rev. 21.1.

They shall not awake] Out of the sleep of death: nor be raised] viz. by the
sound of the last trump, till the last day. But raised they shall be, and sleep
no more, viz. when the heavens shall be no more. And till that time the bodies
of the Saints are laid in the grave, as in a bed of down; or of spices, to
mellow and ripen: this is matter of joy and triumph, Isa. 26.19. Dan. 12.2.
when they were to lose all: so Heb. 11.35. The wicked also sleep in the grave,
Dan. 12.2. but shall awake to everlasting shame and contempt, ib. their sick
sleep shall have a woeful waking, for they shall be raised by virtue of Christ's
judiciary power, and by the curse of the law, to look upon him whom they have
pierced, and to hear from him that dreadful discedite, Depart ye cursed etc.

Verse 13. O that thou would hide me in the grave] As in a sweet and safe
repository, sanctuary! Sepulchrum est quasi scrinium vel capsa in quam
reponitur corpus.
my soul meanwhile living and reigning with thee in heaven, expecting a
glorious Resurrection, and saying, How long, Lord, Holy, and True? The fable or
fancy of Psychopannychia has been long since hissed out, though lately revived
by some Libertines, that last brood of Beelzebub; our Mortalists especially,
who say, that the body and soul die together. But what says the Apostle, Romans
8.10? If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is
life because of righteousness. Now that Job thus woos death, and petitions for
the grave, it is manifest that he saw some good in it, and that he promised
himself by it Malorum ademptionem, bonorum adeptionem, freedom from evil, and
fullness of good: we should learn to familiarize death to our selves, and put
the grave under the fairest and easiest apprehensions, think we hear God
bespeaking us as once he did Jacob, Fear not to go down to Egypt (so down to
the grave) for I will go with thee, and will surely bring thee up again, Genesis
46.4. Or as he did his laboring Church, Isa. 26.20. Come my people, enter thou
into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thy self, as it were for
a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.

That thou would keep me secret] In limbo Patrum, say the Papists, in
parabola ovis capras suas quaerentes.

Until thy wrath be passed] For it is such, as I can of my self neither avoid
nor abide. Turn it away therefore, or turn it into gentleness and kindness,
Psalm 6.4. and be friends again, Jer. 2.35. Or, secret and secure me til the
resurrection, when all thy wrath will be gone from me.

That thou would appoint me a set time] Heb. set me a statute: set down even
what time thou please, either to send me to bed, or to call me up again, so
that thou will but be sure at last to remember me.

And remember me] Job is willing to die out of the world, but to die out of
Gods memory; to be out of sight, but not out of mind; that God should bury him
in the grave, but not bury his thoughts of him: he could be content to be free
among the dead, free of that company, but not as the slain that lie in the
grave, whom God remembers no more, Psalm. 88.5. Job would be remembered for
good, as Nehemiah prays, and be dealt with as Moses was, whose body once hid
in the valley of Moab, did afterward appear glorious in Mount Tabor at the
transfiguration.

Verse 14. If a man dye, shall he li^e again?] This he speaks in way of
admiration at that glorious work of the Resurrection. See the like question
chap. 15.11. Genesis 3.1. and 17.17. So the Apostle Romans 8.30, 31. having spoken
of those glorious things, predestination, vocation, justification,
glorification, concludes in these words, What shall we say then? We cannot
tell what to say to these things, so much we are amazed at the greatness of
Gods goodness in them. Surely, as they have a lovely scarlet blush of Christ's
blood upon them, so they are rayed upon with a beam of divine love, to them
that are in Christ. We read of that godly and learned Scotch-Divine Mr. John
Knox, that a little before his death, he gat up out of his bed, and being asked
by his friends, why being so sick, he would offer to rise, and not rather take
his rest? he answered, that he had all the last night been taken up in the
meditation of the Resurrection, and that he would now go up into the pulpit,
that he might im part to others the comforts which thereby himself had
received. And surely if he had been able to have done as he desired, I know not
what text fitter for his purpose he could have taken, then these words of Job,
If a man die, shall he live again? He shall without question; and those that
deny it or doubt of it (as the Sadduces of old, and some brainsick people of
late) they err, not knowing the Scriptures (this among the rest) which are
express for it, and the power of God. Mat. 22.29. being herein worse then
devils which believe it and tremble; worse then some heathens, who held there
would be a resurrection, as Zoroastres, Theopompus, Plato, etc. worse then
Turks, who at this day confess and wait for a resurrection of the body at such
a time as the fearful trumpet (which they call Soor shall be sounded by Mahomet,
say they, at the commandment of the great God of the judgment.

All the days of mine appointed time (or warfare) will I wait till my change
come] i. e. till my death ( Prove. 31.8. men appointed to die, are called in the
original children of change) or till the resurrection come, when we shall all
be changed, 1 Cor. 15.51. our vile bodies shall be changed and conformed to
Christ's most glorious body (the standard) Philip. 3.23. in beauty, agility,
impassibility, and other Angelical perfections. When I awake, says David, sc.
at that general Resurrection, I shall be full of thine image; Psalm 17.15. I
shall be brought from the jaws of death, to the joys of eternal life, where
are riches without rust, pleasures without pain etc. Three glimpses of this
glorious change were seen. 1. In Moses his face. 2. In Christ's transfiguration.
3. In Stevens countenance when he stood before the council. Such a change as
this is well worth waiting for: what would not a man do? what would he not
suffer with those noble professors, Heb. 11. to obtain a better resurrection? I
would swim through a sea of brimstone, says one, that I might come to heaven
at last. The stone will fall down to come to its own place, though it break it
self in twenty pieces: so we, that we may get to our center which is upwards
etc. Sursum cursum nostrum dirigamus; and manantem, imminentem and
exterminantem mortem attendamus: ne simul, cum corporis fractura, animae
jacturam faciamus. Let us wait and wish every one for himself, as he once did.

Mi sine nocte diem, vitam sine morte, quietem
Det sine fine, dies, vita, quiesque Deus.
Verse 15. Thou shall call, and I will answer thee] At the Resurrection of the
just thou shall call me out of the grave by thine All-powerful voice, uttered
by that Archangel, with the trump of God, 1 These. 4.16. 1 Cor. 15.52. Psalm
50.3, 4. and thou shall not need to call twice: for as I shall not need then to
fear (as the hypocrites will) to show my face: so I will readily answer, Here I
am; Mr. Boroughs.
yea (as that dying Saint did so) I will say, I come, I come, I come, I will
even leap out of the grave to obey thine orders: and I doubt not but to draw me
out of that dark prison, thou will lend me that hand of thine, whereof I have
the honor to be the workmanship.

Thou will have a desire to the work of thine hands] I know that thou thy self
(for the love thou bear me, of thy goodness, who am thy creature, Abbot.
and on whom thou have shown favor, and reprinted thine image) wilt long after
the consummation of my happiness; for then I shall be like unto thee (more
like then ever) for I shall see thee as thou art, and appear with thee in
glory, Col. 3.4. 1 John 3.2.
being next unto thee, Luke 22.30. Yea, one with thee, John 17.21. and so above
the most glorious Angels, Heb. 1.14. The King shall greatly desire my beauty,
Psalm. 45.11. and rejoice over me, as the bridegrom does over his bride, Isa.
62.5. See chap. 10.3. The word here rendered Thou will have a desire,
signifies, Thou will desire as men do after silver: The Lord seemed to deal by
Job, as men do by dross, to put him away as wicked, Psalm 119.119.
nevertheless, he believed that he would look upon him as silver: and although
he now crushed him together, and brake him to pieces, as the silver-smith does
an old piece of plate which he means to melt; yet that he would in the grave,
as in a furnace refine him, and at the Resurrection bring him out of a new
fashion. Lo this is the right Logic of faith, to make conclusions of life in
death, and of light in darkness, to gather one contrary out of another.

Verse 16. For now thou numbrest my steps] Or, But now thou numbrest etc. thou
keep an exact account of every sin of mine, of every step that I have trod
awry; yea, though it be but some wry motion of my mind (as the Septuagint here
translate) so curious art thou and critical in thine observations of mine
out-strayes, (...)
See chap. 10.14. But is this Job that speaks, or some other? How confident
was he (...)-while, and comfortable in the hope of a glorious resurrection! but
now, down again upon all four, as we say; and like an aguish man in a great fit
of impatiency, which holds him to the end of the chapter? But for this; who
knows not that every new man, is two men? that in the Saints, the flesh is
ever lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh? that in the
Shulamite, is as it were, the company of two armies maintaining a continual
contest, Cant. 0.13? ^said, I am cast out of they sight: yet I will look again
toward thine holy Temple, Jon. 2.4. See the Note there.

Do thou not watch over my sin?] This is the same with the former, but
without a figure. The Rabbines have a saying, that there is not any doubt in
the law, but may be resolved by the context: the Scripture is its own best
Interpreter.

Verse 17. My transgression is sealed up in a bag] As the writings or
informations of a process which is ready to be sentenced, Deuteronomy. 32.34. Hos.
13.12. Thou have, as it were, sealed up, and made sure work with all my sins,
says Job, to have them forthcoming for the increase of my punishment. Look
how the Clark of Assizes (says one) seals up the indictments of men, and at
the Assizes brings his bag, and takes them out to read the same against them:
so God dealt with Job, in his conceit at least. The truth is, God had not
sealed his transgressions in a bag, but had cast them behind his back: a bag
God has for men's sins, and a bottle he has for their tears, Psalm 56.8. Now
Job was one of those penitents that helped to fill Gods bottle, and therefore
he saw at length (though now he were benighted) all his sins, bag, and all
thrown into the sea, and sinking as a weighty millstone in those mighty waters
of free grace, and undeserved mercy.

And thou sowest up mine iniquity] Adsuesne aliquid iniquitati meae? so the
Tigurines translate, i. e. Will thou sew or add any thing to mine iniquity?
will thou tie to it that tag (as a Martyr phraseth it) of the Laws
malediction, conjoyning the punishment to the sin? Adsuere ad iniquitatem, est
poenas poenis continenter adjungere. Merl.
Some make this an explication of the former, q. d. the bag is not only sealed,
but for more surety, sewed too, and that purposely for a purchase of
punishment, as some sense it.

Verse 18. And surely the mountain falling comes to nought] q. d. If thou,
Lord, proceed to deal thus rigidly with me, viz. to number or cipher up my
steps, to watch over my sins, to seal them up in a bag etc. and all this in
fierce wrath, that thou may lay load upon me; what mountain, what rock, what
other creature is ever able to abide it? chap. 6.12. chap. 7.12.
Job had said before, Is my strength the strength of stones? Am I a sea, or a
whale? Were I these, or any the like robustuous creatures, yet could not I
expect to stand before the displeased Omnipotency, who take the hills like
tennis-balls, and crackest the rocks like a Nut-shell. See Hab. 1.4, 5, 6. with
the Notes.

And the rock is removed out of his place] As in earthquakes it sometimes
falls out. See on chap. 9.5. or by reason of the sea underlaking, it decays
in time, and waxes old, as the Hebrew word signifies.

Verse 19. The waters wear the stones] Gutta cavat lapidem etc. the weakest
things wear out the hardest by often falling upon them, or continual running
over them: so does Gods wrath though let out in minnums, secretly, but surely
consume, Hos. 5.12. I will be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah
as rottenness, or that little worm ( teredo) that eats into the heart of wood,
and rots it. Thus he plagued the Egyptians by lice and flies. There may be much
poison in little drops.

Thou washest away the things that grow out of the earth] Or, Thou
ever-flowest, as once in the general deluge (when the face of the earth was
grown so foul, that God was forced to wash it with a flood) and frequently
since, we see that after great rains there are huge floods that mar whole
meadows and corn fields, not only discoloring, but drowning all their beauty
and plenty. This is the fourth comparison used in this and the former verse;
where a man would wonder, says an Interpreter, Olymp.
audire Jobum in medus ^rumuis philosophantem to hear Job in the midst of his
miseries, making use of his philosophy, and traveling thus in his thoughts,
for illustrations of his own case, over mountains, and rocks, etc.

Thou destroyest the hope of man] viz. In destroying the things
abovementioned: or, so thou destroyest etc. though some reserve the raddition
to the next ver^^, so Thou prevailest against him, etc. i.e. So thou never
ceasest with thy might to cast down sorry men, till such time as they changing
countenance, and departing with an heavy and sorrowful heart, thou violently
throwest them out, their lives and hope ending together, if they have been
wicked: as if godly, yet their vain and groundless hopes of prosperity and
plenty, etc. come to nothing; though over the red sea, yet Gods people may be
made to tack about two and forty times in the wilderness.

Verse 20. Thou prevailest for ever against him.] This and the rest of the
words to the end of the Chapter, some make to be the Application of the
Similitudes; Others an Amplification only of what he had said, Thou destroyest
the hope of man. Thou must needs, when thou overmatchest and over-masterest
him, and art never worsted. Exodus 15.3. the Lord is called, A Man of War; the
Chaldee there has it, The Lord and Victor of Wars. And the word here rendered,
Ever, comes from a root that signifies to finish, conquer, and triumph.

And he passes.] scil. Out of the world by a violent or untimely death,
Violen^^ mort^ aut certe immatura. Merlin.
with as ill a will many times as the unjust Steward did out of his Office, as
the Jebusites did out of the Fort of Zion, or as the Devil out of the
Demoniack. S^d voluntas Dei, necessit^s rei; he passes, because he can neither
will nor choose, as they say.

Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.] Eleganter vero mors
notatur, immutandi verbo, says one, Elegant is death set forth by changing the
countenance: for death takes away the fair and fresh color of a man, and
makes him look wan and withered, pale and ghastly. It is eas^e to see death
many times (before it come) in the sick man^face, in his sharp nostrils, thin
cheeks, hollow eyes, etc. Facies Hippocratica.
those Harbingers of death, whereby God sends for him, and so sends him
away, ( extrudit and amandet, as once he did Adam out of Paradise. Lavaters
Note here, is, Propone tihi semper horribileus speciem mortis, ut eo minus
pecces, Set before thy self always the horrid face of death, to restrain thee
from sin.

Verse 21. His sons come to honor, and he knows it not.] Whilst he lies
sick, Omnis in Ascanio chari statcura parentis. Vir.
he regards no earthly thing, no not what becomes of his children (formerly
his greatest care) whether they be advanced or impaired in their outward
condition. As when he is dead he can take no knowledge of any thing done in
this world, Isai. 63.16 Eccles. 2.19. and 96. be his children or friends rich
or poor, high or low, he is both ignorant and insensible. It was a base slander
published by a Jesuit, some years after Queen Elizabeth's death, That as she
died without sense or feeling of Gods mercies, Cambd. Eliz. Prefat.
so that she wished she might after her death hang a while in the Air, to see
what striving would be for her Kingdom. As for that opinion of some Papists,
That the dead do sometimes return into the Land of the living, that they know
how things go here, and make report thereof to those in heaven, it is contrary
to the whole Scripture.

Verse 22. But his flesh upon him shall have pain.] That is, (say some) But as
long as he is living, his body is afflicted with a thousand evils; and though
his soul, by the condition of her creation, be exempt from them, yet she bears
a part in them and becomes miserable with it. A dying man has sorrow without,
and sorrow within; the whole man is in misery, as Job here felt himself. Others
hold, Aben-Ezra. Mercer Deodate
that this Poetical representation has no other meaning, but that the dead
have no manner of communication with the living. Broughtou renders it, His
flesh is grieved for it self, and his soul will mourn for it self; q.d. he
takes no thought or care for his children or nearest relations.

CHAP. XV. Verse 1. Then answered Eliphaz the Temanice, and said.]
LApides, locutus est: In this second encounter, Eliphaz falls upon Job, not so
much with stronger Arguments, as with harder words; reproving him sharply, or
rather reproaching him bitterly, Facundia quadam canina, with more Eloquence
then charity. So hard a thing is it (says Beza) espetially in disputing and
reasoning, to avoid self-love, as even in these times experience daily teaches
us. He hinteth (I suppose) at the public Conference betwixt himself and
Jacobus Andreas at Mompelgard, Lib. 35. Hist.
whereby the strife was rather stirred then stinted, as Thuanus complains. Or
else at the Disputation at Possiacum, wherein Beza, Speaker for the Protestant
party, Hist. of Counc. of Trent 453.
(before the Queen Mother of France, the young King Charles and many Princes of
the Blood) entering into the matter of the Eucharist, spoke with such heat
(unless the Historian wrongs him); that he gave but ill satisfaction to those
of his own side, so that he was commanded to conclude. Such meetings are
seldom successeful (says Luther); because men come with confidence and wit
for victory rather then verity. In this reply of Eliphaz to Job. we may see
what an evil thing it is to be carried away with prejudice and pertinacy, which
make a man forget all modesty, and fall foul upon his best friends. Here Is
enough said to have driven this sorrowful man into utter despair, had not God
upheld his spirit whiles, he is fiercely charged for a wicked man, Non affert
ulla^^ consolationem, non invitat eum ad panitentiam: sed poti^^ ad
desperationem complelas. Lav.
and hated of God: neither does any of his friends henceforth afford him one
exhortation to repentance, or one comfortable promise; as Lavater well
observes.

Verse 2. Should a wise man utter vain knowledge.] Heb. Knowledge of the wind;
light, frothy, empty discourses, that have no tack or substance in them, but
only words that are no better then wind, a mere flash or Aerie nothing. Solomon
thinks, a wise man should beware of falling into this fault, lest he forfeit
his reputation, Eccles. 10.1. Dead flies cause the Ointments of the Apothecary
to send forth a stinking savor. so does a little folly, him that is in
reputation for wisdom and honor; as spots are soonest observed in the whitest
and finest garments; and envy, like worms and moths, does usually feed on the
purest cloth. Neh. 6.11. A great many dead flies may be found in a Tar-box, and
no hurt done, but one of them fallen into a pot of sweet Odours, or precious
Perfumes, may soon taint and corrupt them.

And fill his belly with the East Wind.] Per ventrem, mentem intellige, and per
ventum Orientalem, vanam opinionem, says Vatablus; By belly understand the
mind, and by the East wind a vain conceit, or frothy knowledge, blown forth out
of a swelling breast, to the hurt of others, for the East wind is destructive
to herbs and fruits. Hos. 12.1. Genesis 41.6. But does not Eliphaz here by these
bubble of words, and blustering questions, betraying much choler and
confidence, fall into the very same fault which he finds with Job: Does not
he also fill his belly with heat. (so the Vulgar renders this Text) which
kindling in his bosom, blazeth out at his lips? Does not this angry man exalt
folly, and show himself none of the wisest, though he were the oldest in all
the company.

Verse 3. Should he reason with unprofitable talk?] Why? But if he do, should
he therefore be thus rippled up, and rough-hewed? And not rather reduced and
rectified with hard Arguments and soft words? Man is a cross crabbed creature:
Duci vult, trahi non vult; Persuade him you may, compel him you cannot. A fit
time also must be taken to persuade him to better, for else you may loose your
sweet words upon him. The Husbandman sows not in a storm: The Mariner hoyseth
not sail in every wind: Good Physicians evacuate not the body in extremity of
heat and cold. A brother offend^d is harder to be (...) a strong City, Prove.
18.19. This Eliphaz should have considered, and not so rashly censured Job for
a fool, and his talk for trash, but rather handled him tenderly, considering
his condition, and desired him to explain such of his speeches as he thought
not so well and wisely uttered.

Or with speeches where with he can do no good?] This is but the same with the
former; and indeed this whole verse is but a saying of that plainly, which in
the foregoing verse he had said figuratively.

Varse 4. Yea thou castest off fear.] Heb. Thou make void sear; that is,
Religion, whereof the fear of God is both the beginning, Prove. 1.7. and the
end, Eccles. 12.1. This is an heavy charge indeed; as if Job, by saying, the
extreme miseries of this life are common to the godly and the wicked, had by
consequence taught men to cast off all Religion as unprofitable, which none but
such a shameless man as thy self, says Eliphaz, would ever have averred. It
cannot be denied, but that Job, through the bitterness of his grief, and the
unreasonablenesse of his adversaries, was somewhat carried beyond the bounds of
that reverence which is do unto God, and reasons the matter somewhat hotly
with God; but that thereby he bewrayed his manifest contempt of his Majesty,
casting off all awful regard and recourse thereto by Prayer, as the wicked, who
call not upon God, Psalm. 14.4. This was a meet ^avil, or rather an unsufferable
injury done to the good man, who gave sufficient testimony of his searing God,
and estsoons poured out his prayer in his presence. All which notwithstanding,
he hears in the next words,

And restrainest prayer before God.] Thou forbearest to pray thy self, and thou
discouragest others. If this had been true, it had been a foul fault indeed,
for whiles Prayer stands still, the whole Trade of godliness stands still
likewise, and to cast off Prayer, is to cast off God: Jer. 10.25. We must take
heed of falling from the affections of Prayer, though we continue doing the
Duty. As vessels of Wine, when first tapped, are very smart and quick, but at
last grow exceeding flat: so do many Christians, (through unbelief, and worldly
cares an businesses, or domestical discords, or some other distempers, whereby
prayers are hindered, 1 Pet. 3.7.) either they pray not frequently, or not
fervently, but in a customary formal bedulling way. And this Eliphaz might
suspect Job of, and assign it as the cause of all his miscarriages in word and
deed. Sure it is, that as sleep composeth drunkenness, so does prayer the
affections: a man may pray himself sober again, Dr. Preston.
as a Reverend man gathers out of this Text.

Verse 5. For thy mouth utters thine iniquity.] Heb. Thy crooked, wry
disposition that stands acrosse to God and goodness, Psalm. 51.5. Homo est
inversus decalogus. Solomon speaks of perverse lips, as if the upper lip
stood where the nether should, Prove. 4.24. And Saint Jude speaks of hard
speeches, uttered by ungodly sinners, Jude 15. such as Job was none, whatever
Eliphaz by mis-interpreting, made of him, wresting his words to a wrong sense,
as Psalm. 56.5. and by a spiritual unmannerlinesse, making the worst of that he
spoke; there being not any thing that may not be taken with the left hand. Now
if this befell Job from his friends and those godly persons, what wonder though
the like, and worse be done to us by wicked enemies.

Qui ia quod boni est excer punt, dicunt quod mali est. Terent. Phorm

Nibil est quin male narrando possit depravarier.
And thou chusest the tongue of the crafty] Then the which, nothing is a
greater enemy to piety, says an Interpreter. Politicians formallize and
enervate the power of truth, till at length they leave us a heartlesse and
saplesse Religion, says another. Such an one Eliphaz makes Job to be: q.d.
Thou wast wont to speak prayer, but now thou speak Policy, yea, Thou chusest
to do it, thou love evil more then good, and lying rather then to speak
right. Psalm. 523. Thou have as many turnings and windings in thy mind, as the
Serpent has in his body (so the Hebrew word seems to signify, Genesis 3.1.)
Thus he heightneth his charge, and lays on yet more load.

Verse 6. Thine own mouth condemns thee, and not I.] Yes you, and none but
you. Jobs heart condemned him not (and thence his confidence toward God, 1 John
3.21) much less his month, had not his words been misconstrued. But as charity
makes a good sense of doubtful speeches and passages; so prejudice and
displeasure takes all things (though well meant) at the worst, and as Logicians
do, Sequitur partem deteriorem. Eliphaz diggeth up evil, Prove. 16.27. and is
like Achilles, of whom Homer says, that he was a great find-fault.

(...) Iliad. l. 9.
Yea, thine own lips testify against thee] Heb. Answer against thee. For
Witnesses ordinarily answer to Interrogatories. So the pride of Israel
(breaking forth as a great master-pock in his forehead) testified to his face,
Hos. 5.5. and the Heretic is condemned of himself, Tit. 3.11. Virtually he
does so, though not formally. But Job did neither good Eliphaz.

Verse 7. Art thou the first man that was born?] Or, Wast thou made before
Adam? Out of the mouth of Ad^m, Ut vox Rishon non significet primus, sed prius.
Lavat. Bucholc.
as from a fountain, flowed whatsoever profitable Learning, Skill or Wisdom,
is found in the world, says the divine Chronologer. Job had taxed Zophar for a
young puny and a Novice, chap 12. This, Eliphaz. kindles at, and takes upon
him to answer in Zophars behalf. As indeed these three speakers, Eliphaz.
Zophar and Bildad stood to one another, as much as any one of them did for
himself, as if they had all entered bond, and given security for reciprocal
assistance. Here then Eliph^z asks. Art thou the first man born? that is, Art
thou the wisest man alive? and must we all be taught by thee, as Adams Nephews
were by him, in things divine and humane.

Or wast thou made before the bills?] i.e. Before the Angels, as some sense it.
But take it literally for the Mountains, called for their Antiquity, the
everlasting hills Genesis 49.26. Hab. 3.6. because they were from the beginning,
and shall continue to the end. These appeared first at the separation of the
waters, Genesis 1. And Christ, to set forth his eternity, says, Prove 8.25. Before
the mountains were settled, before the hills, was I brought forth. So Psalm.
90.21.

Verse 8. Have thou heard the secret of God?] Thus he goes on to jear Job, and
to accuse him of insolent Arrogance, as if he had taken himself to be of Gods
Cabinet-Councel, Biliefi and bellicosi.
and so to have known more of his mind then any other. Now this never came into
Jobs heart: but these hot spirited people, when their choler is once up, will
not stick to say any thing against another whom they desire to gall, and to
make the worst of his words, when as themselves cannot take a reproof, though
never so just.

And do thou restrain wisdom to thy self?] Have thou engrossed all the wisdom
in the world? and must it needs live and dye with thee? Is every man a fool
presently, An solus sapis, ita ut te pareunte sit ipsa sapientia peritura?
Vatabl.
who is not of thy mind and make? Epicurius indeed had such a conceit; and
Palaemon, in Suetonius, and Laurentius Valla, with some others of late: but Job
was far from it, as appears by his many self-abasing expressions: and it had
been well for him, if his three friends, had taken out that lesson in wisdoms
school; viz. to judge those certain good things found in another, better then
they are, and certain evils, less, doubtful good things, certain, and
doubtful evil things, none.

Verse 9. What know thou, that we know not?] Here Eliphaz inveigheth against
Jobs pride, sed majori cum fastu, but with greater pride, else what means
this arrogant comparison? Did not a deceived heart burn him aside, as the
Prophet speaks in another case? and might it not be said of him, as it was
once of Antony, That he hated a Tyrant, but not Tyranny. See the Notes above on
chap. 12.3. and 13.2.

Verse 10. With us are the gray headed, etc.] Job had said, chap. 12.12. With
the ancient is wisdom, and in length of days is understanding. This, though
modestly spoken, yet was very ill taken; and is here replied unto with a great
deal of heat; Sed ita solent importuni homines, etc. says Mercer here: But
such is the course and custom of unreasonable men, to take every thing in the
worst way, and to deal rather by reproaches, then by reasons; as Eccius,
Sanderus, Gen^brardus, the whole generation of Jesuits, of whom A^relius the
Sorbonist says, and truly, that they are a sort of men, qui nihil magis habent
qu^m arrogantiam T^eologica^ ni^il minus possident quam Theologica^ ^cienti^m;
Arrogant and yet ignorant; for whiles they think they know all things, they
know nothing at all as they ought to know, 1 Cor. 8.2. As for Antiquity, (here
so s^iffely pleaded) it must have no more Authority then what it can maintain.
Papists boast much of it, as once the Gibeonites did of old, shoes and moldy
bread. But antiquity severed from verity is of no value: for as Cyprian says
well, Consuet^do mala, vetustas erroris est. And our Savior says not, I am
custom, but, I am the Way, the Truth, etc. And God says, by the Prophet
Ezekiel, Walk ye not in the statutes of your Fathers, neither observe their
judgments, etc. but walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them,
chap. 20.18, 19. See the Notes on chap. 8.8, 9, 10. and on 12.12.

Verse 11. Are the consolations of God.] Sic fastu^se suas consolationes
appellat and sociorum, says Mercer: so Eliphaz. with state enough, calls the
comforts that he and his fellows had ministered to Job, promising him mercy
from God upon his sound repentance; but telling him withal, that unless he
would yield himself an hypocrite, those promises would profit him nothing at
all. Had Job slighted the precious promises, those conduits of comfort, he had
been much to blame, as he was doubtless, who said, My soul refused comfort,
Psalm. 77.2. Like some sullen child, that will not eat his milk, because he has
it not in the golden dish. The soul is ready to turn the back of the hand, and
not the palm, to the staff of divine consolations, saying, Oh my stubbornness!
etc. and rather to shift and shark in every by corner for comfort, then to suck
it out of those breasts of consolation, and be satisfied, Isai. 60.11. The
Apostle taxes his Hebrews, that they had forgotten the consolation (so the
words may be read) which spoke unto them as unto children saying, My son, etc.
Heb. 12.^. Wrangling with God by caviling Objections, when they should rather
have wrastled with him by earnest supplications, putting the Promises in suit,
and drawing waters with joy, out of those wells of consolation, Isai. 12.3. Job
was not altogether clear of this fault. He was so poor and sore without, and
within so full of horror and terror, that he was ready with Rachel, to refuse
to be comforted. Mercies were offered unto him, but he was scarce in case to
receive them. The ear which tastes words as the mouth does meat, was so filled
with choler, that he could hardly relish any comfort. The easiest Medicines or
Waters are troublesome to sore eyes. The flesh with her roarings and repinings
makes such a din, that the voice of the Comforter cannot well be heard in the
best heart sometimes. The Spirit knocks but there is none to open: Hence he
goes away grieving, and that should not be.

Is there any secret thing with thee?] Have thou meat to eat that we know not
of? Are there with thee consolations of thine own better then those of God,
which we have ministered unto thee? Some render it, And lies there any hidden
thing within thee? that is, Either some greater and more profound wisdom then
every man knows; or else some secret sin which must be cast out ere comforts
can fasten. For as the wound cannot close and heal, as long as any part of the
iron weapon remains in it; so herein the Cordiaca passio, or passion of
heart, the heart i^ so oppressed and over-covered, that the most refreshing
cordials cannot come at it, so that it is even suffocated with sorrow. In
allusion whereunto, the Church prays, La^. 3.65. Give them sorrow of heart.
This was Spira's case; and for the time might be Jobs. Possibly some sin or
sorrow might lie at the fountainhead, and stop the course of his comforts.
This Eliphaz fisheth after, and would have found out, and remedied.

Verse 12. Why does thine heart carry thee away?] Violently transport thee;
scil. beyond all bounds of reason and modesty. There is another charge, Quis te
furor cordis exagitas? Pineda.
and higher then the former, as if he had been emotae mentis, not well in his
wits, but wild and wood as they call it; or at least; that his passions were so
far too hard for his reason, as they did Rectam de cardine tollere mentem,

We are in no small danger of our naughty hearts: It was no ill prayer of one,
Lord, keep me from that naughty man, my self. Nor was it any ill counsel of
another, Domine libera me a malo homine, meipso. Ita cave tibi ut cave as
teipsum;
who said, So take heed to thy self, that thou beware of thy self. Though there
were no devil, yet our corrupt nature would act Satan's part against it self; it
would have a supply of wickedness (as a Serpent has of poison) from it self,
it has a spring to feed it. Keep thy heart therefore with all custody, Prove.
4.24. it will get away else, and carry thee away with it.

And what do thine eyes wink at?] Nictant, celeriterscilicit, and subtiliter.
Possibly Job, through pain and anguish might be made to wink whiles he was
speaking to them, or they to him; and this they misconstrue as done in
contempt. See Psalm 35.19. Or that he was plotting some mischief, Prove. 10.10.
and 16.30. or pretending to some extraordinary devotion, and therefore shutting
his eyes that he might be the more reserved to God. The Vulgar has it, Why
does thine heart life thee up? and, as if thou were thinking of some great
things, why are thine eyes so set? It is for no goodness sure.

Verse 13. That thou turnest thy spirit against God.] A foul fault surely, but
merely for want of a fair Interpretation. It is as if Eliphaz should have
said, Thy spirit was right when thou bravely barest up under the afflicting
hand of God, chap. 1. but because patience has not had her perfect work as
appears by thine angry expostulations, Quid tumet contra Deum Spiritus tuus.
thy contesting with God, and chatting against him and his proceedings,
therefore I conclude that thou art not perfect and ^utire all is not right. Why
does thy spirit swell against God? (so the Vulgar renders it) Behold his soul
which is listed up, is not upright in him, that is certain, Hab. 2.4.

And let such words go d^t of thy mouth.] Contumelious and blasphemous
words not fit to he named. Bona verba, quaeso Eliphaz. True it is, Job had
spoken some things more freely then was fitting, and not without a tincture of
bitterness. But charity would have made the best of those speeches which you
thus odiously aggravate against him; and have taught you to use the same equity
toward others, that you would have others use toward your self. That faith
(and so that love) is easily wrought, which teaches men to believe and think
well of themselves, and worse of others. We will make a good exposition, if we
have but a good disposition.

Verse 14. What is man that he should be clean?] Eliphaz has now done chiding
(it is but time he should) and falls to reasoning; wherein nevertheless he
shows himself an empty and troublesome Disputer urging again the same
Arguments as before, chap. 14.17, 18, 19. and not resting satisfied in a
sufficient answer. Did Job ever assert himself clean? Said he not the clean
contrary in many places? see chap. 14.4. Only as washed, sanctified, and
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of his God, 1 Cor.
6.11. he discoursed of his integrity and righteousness; not denying himself
otherwise tainted with Original sin, and guilty of actual; which he begged
pardon for, according to the tenor of the Covenant of Grace. And therefore
Eliphaz might have spared these words, and better bestowed his pains in
comforting Job, and exhorting him to patience. The Jesuits have at this day a
device in handling Texts of Scripture by their nice distinctions to perplex and
obscure the clearest places; and for those that are doubtful, not at all to
distinguish or illustrate them. Again, in points of controversy they make a
great putther about that which we deny not, but say little or nothing to the
maine business.

Hac que desperant renitescere posse relinquunt. Verse 15 Behold he puts no
trust in his Saints] Here he proceeds to prove that which Job never denied;
and Bildad also has the same chap. 25. Lege ejus verba, nam non male huc
quadrant, says Lavater; Lay his words to these, and they will lend light to
each other. See also the Notes on chap. 4.18. There they are called his
servants. here his Saints or holy ones; these were the old Patriarks, say the
Septuagint, with whom God at sometimes was angry; and although he was a God
that for gave them, yet took he vengeance of their inventions, Psalm. 99.8.
Others understand it of the Saints in heaven, or the holy Angels.

And the heavens are not clean in his sight.] Nor they of heaven be clean in
his eyes, so Broughton renders it. The Angels are called angels of heaven,
Marth. 24.36. and Gal. 1.8. Because made with and in the highest heavens, and
appointed there to inhabit. Howbeit in the Apostate Angels, and in heaven,
Gods holy and pure eyes found uncleanness, and delivered them therefore into
chains of darkness, 2 Pet. 2.4. Again, to be clean in Gods sight is another
manner of matter then to be simply clean: like as to be just is one thing, and
to be just before God, another, Luke 1.6. Sordat in conspect^ judicis
quodfulget in conceptu operantis. Some understand the Text of the visible
heavens, the purest of all inanimate creatures (and therefore Chrysostom
speaking of those praying Saints that prayed Peter out of prison, Act. 12.
says, that they were ipso coelo puri^res afflictione facti, more pure then the
heavens, yet are they not pure in the sight of God, but have their spots which
we count their beauty spo^^.

Verse 16. How much more abominable and filthy is man?] And therefore
abominable because filthy, or stinking and noisome, as putrified meat is to the
nose and palate. Now this is every man's case by nature, Psalm. 14.3. there being
never a barrel better herring, but all in a pickle, though few believe it.
Ka^ol (...) Prove Psalm. 49. ult. Tremel.
Circumcision of old taught them, that that which was begotten by that part
deserved in like sort, as abominable and accursed, to be cut off and thrown
away by God. And what else does Baptism still teach us? See Col. 2.11, 12, 13.
1 Pet. 3.21. David compares man to the beasts that perish, pecoribus
mortici^^, to beasts that dye of the Murrain, and so become carrion, and are
good for nothing. He lies notting in the graves of sin, wrapped up in the
winding sheet of hardness of heart, and (as a carcass crawleth with worms)
swarming with noisome lusts, such as Gods soul abhors. This is his nature:
and for his life,

He drinks iniquity like water] He is as it were altogether steeped and
soaked in sin? he sucks it in with delight as an Ox does water, or a drunkard
Wine, who had as liefe you take away his life as his Liquor, and could find in
his heart to be drowned in a Butt of Malmsey: as George Duke of Clarence was in
the Tower of London, and as some say, by his own Election. Sure it is that a
draught of sin is the only Merry-go-down to a carnal man; he drinks it
frequently and abundantly, even till he swells therewith. One observes here,
that Eliphaz says not, Man eats, but, drinks iniquity: because to eat a
man must chew, and this takes up some time, and leaves a liberty to spit out
what he likes not: but drink goes down without delay, and we usually drink
oftener then we eat: So here

Verse 17. I will show thee, hear me.] Here Eliphaz uses a short but a lofty
preface, calling hard for attention, and raising in Job an expectation of no
mean matters. But Quid dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu. Horat.


This is his Argument:

That is to be held for true which experience evinceth, and wise men teach us,
as themselves have learned of their religious Ancestors.

But, both continued experience, and consent of men teach us, that wicked men
have terrors within, and troubles without.

Therefore this is to be taken for a truth. Therefore also by consequence, that
is false which thou have spoken concerning the prosperity of wicked men, chap.
12.6. Neither can thou avoid the charge of wickedness who do suffer the
punishments of the wicked. Now what is all this more then Eliphaz had said in a
former discourse? (so that Job might have cried out, Apage coccysmum) only
there he groundeth his Argument upon a night-vision; here upon the testimony
and consent of certain wise men, commended by their power and justice. Some
think he means Noah and his pious posterity.

That which I have seen, I will declare] Will thou not believe in eyewitness?
What can be more sure then sight? 1 John 1.1. Surely, if we were well read in
the Story of our own lives, and had laid up our experiences, we might have a
divinity of our own. The 119 Psalm is made up of experiments; and David often
tells us what he had seen and observed.

Verse 18. Which wise men have told from their fathers,] Who have carefully and
faithfully transmitued it as a doctrinal truth to us their posterity, from hand
to hand. For in Jobs time it is likely that the Scriptures were not yet written.
Which, or, Which things wise men] who did in their generations, Deum recte
cognoscere and c^l^r^, rightly know and worship God, which is the highest
wisdom, says Lactanti^^. Have told] Have spoken it so plainly and
plentifully, as if they had showed us the things acted before our eyes. From
their Fathers] Who were careful to instill good instructions and heavenly truths
into the minds of their children, their familiars and families, as did Abraham,
Genesis 18. and others according to Gods own appointment, Deuteronomy. 6.

And have not hid it] But communicated it for the good of many. Light in
diffusive of it self. Knowledge is perfected while it is communicated. The more
you teach and impart to others, Bodin. theat. Not. p. 9.
eo ditior ac doctior fias, says One, the richer and skilfuller you become. It
is not pouring out. but want of pouring out that dries up the streams of
grace, as of that Oil, 2 King. 4.6. See Prove. 11.24, 25. Psalm. 78.2, 3, 4.

Verse 19. Merlin. Bold.
To whom alone the earth was given] Noah and his pious posterity (as was above
noted) whom Methodins and other Ancients call, Misudi chiliarchas, the Lords of
the whole word, given them by the Poss^ssor of heaven and earth, as
Melchisedech first calls God, Genesis 23.
Genesis 14. and from him Abraham another Prince of God; as those Heathens
acknowledged him, and heir of the whole world, Romans 4. As for Melchisedec
(commonly taken to be Sem) he was King in Salem and no stranger, that is, no
enemy molested him; no not those great spoilers. Kedarlaomer and his Accomplices;
these never meddled with Melchiseaec and his subjects (probably out of respect
to his wisdom and holiness, for which he was famous) no not when marching
against the Kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, they wasted and smot all the neighbor
Countries. So true of his subjects and territories was that which follows
here.

And no stranger passed among them] viz. in an hostile way, in a warlike
manner, Nah. 1.15. Some read, No strangs thing passed among them; As not the
devouring sword, so neither the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor the
destruction that wastes at noon day, Psalm 91.6. Such as was the reign of
Ferdinando the third, King of Spain for five and thirty years space. In quibus
nee fames nec pestes fuit in regno says L^piz, Gloss in Prolog. par. 1.
wherein there fell out neither Famine not Pestilence.

Verse 20. The wicked man travelleth with pain all his days.] He tormenteth
himself, or thrusts himself through (so some read it) 1 Timothy 6.10. He takes
no more rest then one upon a Rack; he has his hands on his loins, as a woman
in travel, Jer. 30.6. he smites upon his thigh; sicut mulierculae in puerperio
facere solent, says Luther in his Marginal Note on Jea. 31.19. And if he would
do so for his sin (as he does for his misery) pia esset illa tristitia. and (si
dici potest) beata miseria, as Austin has it; Aug Epist. 545.
his grief would be godly, and his misery a blessing, God would pity him as he
did his moan-making Ephraim and earnestly remember him still, ver. 20. But
alas, the wicked wight, the hypocrite in heart, as he heaps up wrath, so he
cries not, when God binds him, Job 36.16. Or if he do cry, it is perii. and
not peccavi, I am undone, and not, I have done amiss. Hence God many times
turns loose upon him those three Vultures, Care, Fear and Grief, to feed upon
his heart. It is seldom seen that God allows unto the greatest darlings of
the world a perfect contentment. In the very pursuit of these outward vanities
is much anguish, many grievances, fears, jealousies, disgraces, interruptions,
di^contentments. In the unsanctified enjoyment of them, something the wicked
shall have to complain of, that shall give an unsavory verdure to their
sweetest morsels; and make their very felicity miserable; witness Ahab, Human,
etc. But then follows the sting of conscience, that makes a Cain, a Pashur,
a Richard the third, to be a terror to himself. And with this pain some wicked
men travel all their days here, but hereafrer it shall infallibly and
inexpressibly torment the souls of them all, through all eternity. And this
with the following illustrations is that Oracle or divine sentence which
Eliphaz received from those famous men above mentioned, and which he not
obscurely applies and wresteth against Job, whom herehence he would prove a
wicked man by his own concessions, chap. 3.25, 26. and 7.13; 14. compared with
Devit. 26, 36. Deu^. 28.65. for that which Eliphaz had heard from his
Ancestors, was but the same Law, for substance, that was afterward written by
Moses.

And the number of years is hidden to the Oppressour] Heb. to the terrible
Tyrans, who as he has not a more cruel Executioner, then his own conscience,
so not a more sensible displeasure, then to know that he is mortal, and yet to
be ignorant when his Tyranny must end, The number of the years of his Tyranny
is uncertain, says the Vulgar translation. And from this uncertainty which he
knows not how to remedy (though he run to light a candle at the devil
sometimes, viz. by consulting with Soothsayers and Sorcerers to know of them
how long he shall live, and who shall succeed him, as Tiberius and other
Tyrants did) follows suspicion and fear, says Aquinas upon this Text.

Verse 21. A dreadful sound is in his ears] Heb. A sound of fear and terrors;
Not one but many at once, so that he is a Magor-missabib, factus a cord suo
fugitivus, Tertul.
as Cain that Caitiff, and those Hivites with their hornets of a clamorous
conscience, worse to them then if their bodies had been tormented with stings,
or torn with stripes. Exodus 23.28
What a sound of terror in their ears frighted those Syrians, 2 Kings 7.6? And
those Persians and Saracen^ overcome by Theodosius? Panice terrore incusso,
says the Historian, afraid of their own shadows, they desperately cast
themselves into the River Euphrates, and there perished above an hundred
thousand of them, Auno Dom. 394. Fusic.
The wicked flies when none pursues. Prove. 28.1. The sound of a shaken leaf
chaseth him, Lev. 26.36. when the righteous is bold as a Lion, and not dismayed
at evil tidings, Psalm. 112.7. His heart is balanced with the fear of God; and
thence it is that he floateth steddily, blow what wind it will, he sails to
the Port; storms and tempests do but beat him into it.

In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.] Heb. In peace, when he shall
say, Peace and safety. 1 These. 5.3. When he is at the highest he shall be
destroyed, Dan. 4.30, 31. In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in
straits, Job 20.22. his short Spring shall have an eternal Winter, Psalm. 92.7.
Vltimus sanitat is gradut est morbo proximus, say Physicians, the utmost degree
of health is nearest to sickness; so the wicked when nearest misery, have
greatest prosperity.

Verse 22. He believes not that he shall return out of darkness] He despondeth
and despaireth of a better condition, sighing out that doalful ditty, Desperate
qui summus est diffidentiae greadus. Jun.
Spes and fortuna valete, he looks for no further light and delight of former
comforts; he knows that they that go down into the dark pit, cannot hope for
Gods truth, Isas. 38.18. There being left them neither hope of better, nor
place of worse.

And he is waited for of the sword.] Or, looked upon by the sword, which
waits, as it were, an opportunity to slay him. Circumspectans undique
gladium, so the Vulgar; He looks this way and that way as fearing the
Murderer; his guilt representing to him on all sides nothing but naked swords;
he believes that they will assassine him in his bed. This was the case of
Saul, who suspected his best servants: of Dionysius the Tyrant, who durst not
trust his own daughter with his throat: Of Alexander Pheraeus, who would not go
to bed to his wife Thebe whom he loved, Tul. Offic. lib. 2.
till he had first searched the room and her pocket for edge-tools. Dan. Hist.
249.
Of Richard the third, who after the death of his two innocent Nephews, had
fearful dreams and apprehensions, insomuch that he did often leap out of his
bed in the dark, and catching his sword (which always naked stuck by his side)
he did go distractedly about the Chamber, every where seeking to find out the
cause of his own occasioned disquiet, says the Chronologer. Tiberius felt the
remorse of conscience so violent, Tacit.
that he protested to the Senate, that he suffered death daily through fear of
death; whereupon the Historian makes this profitable Observation, Tandem
fa^inora and f^agitia in supplicium vertuntur; Heinous sins will at length have
heavy punishments.

Verse 23. He wandreth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it?] He is hard put
to it for necessaries, and would be glad of a piece of bread, as 1 Samuel 25.36.
Herodot.
This was the case of Pythias, once so rich, that he entertained a million of
men (even Xerx^s his whole huge Host) for three days space, at his own proper
charge, but afterward so poor, that he dyed through hunger. And the like
befell Gillimer, King of Vandales, of whom it is storied, that being overcome
and beleagured by Bellisarius, he sent to him for a Sponge to dry his tears, a
Cittern to ease his grief, and a piece of bread to save his life. Bellisarius
himself was afterward glad to beg his bread. And Henry the fourth, Emperor of
Germany, after ten years Reign, was desposed and driven to the like exigent;
whereupon he is said to have made use of those words of Job, chap. 19.21. Have
pity upon me have pity upon me O ye my friends, for the hand of God has
touched me. And there is no doubt but Eliphaz glanceth at Job in all these
expressions as if he were the man whom he here describes with much Eloquence,
but small charity.

He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.] His conscience
tells him, that he is not yet at worst; he knows in himself, say the
Septuagint, that further evil shall be upon him, that his misery is inevitable,
and at next door by; and this knowledge, being full of fear, is also full of
torment: it is even hell before hand, and above ground.

Verse 24. Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid] Or, Scare him, not only
out of his comforts, Mentis inops moritur. Epist. Hist. Gal. Plut.
but out of his wits and senses too, as it did Charles the great Cardinal of
Lorrain. See Deuteronomy. 28.34. Tullus Hostilius the third King of Romans deriding
the Religion of his Predecessor Numa, as that which did emasculate men's minds,
was afterward so terrified, that he set up and worshipped two new gods; viz
Pavorem and Pallorem, Trouble and anguish, which he had perpetually present
with him, as Lactantius reports. What a pitiful agony Vitellius the Emperor
was in, (...)
when Vespasians Army marched toward Rome, is notably set forth by Dio in his
life. Not long after that at the sack of Jerusalem, some Jews killed
themselves, left they should fall into the hands of Vespasians soldiers.

Hic rego; non furor est, ne moriare, mori? They shall prevail against him:]
Or, begirt him as a King is environed in peace, by his Guard, in War by his
Army. Or, They shall destroy him, as a King ready to the battle does his
enemies forces, which he routeth and ruineth. Fear has a deadly force upon
feeble spirits; neither is it nay wonder that they ring their bells backward,
when things begin once to be on fire.

Verse 25. For he stretches out his hand against God.] Worthy therefore to
have a dead Palsy transfused into it, or dried up, as Jeroboams was, when but
stretched out against a Prophet: and as Valens the Emperors hand was made
unable to hold a pen, when he would have subscribed a Warrant for the banishing
of Basit. Such a Giant-like generation there are to this day among men; as face
the heavens, cast down the gantlet against God, Erecto collo valido impetu,
arrogantia incurvi cervica, says Brentius upon the Text, with stiff necks,
full force, and insufferable insolence, as it were on purpose to cross the
Almighty, and to wrestle a fall with him: they sin with an high hand, Levit.
26.21. Numb. 15.30. and do as wickedly as they can, Jer. 3.5. yea, with both
hands earnestly, Mich 7.3. Persecuting his people who are unto him as the apple
of his eye, Act. 7.51
and resisting the Holy Ghost always. Surely, he would even destroy God if he
could, for he hates him, Romans 1.30. With an hellish hatred (as the word there
signifies) such as strikes at Gods very essence, Psalm. 10.41. confer 1 John
3.15. (...)


And strengthens himself against the Almighty] Sed vana sine viribus ire. To
his sinews of iron, he has added brows of brass, Isai. 48.4. To his natural
crosnesse, habitual hardness and hardiness: so that now, like a stout
Warrior, he bends all his strength against the Almighty, but with no better
success, then to be broken in pieces, Isai. 8.9. with his it on Mace, Psalm.
2.9. Sennacherib for instance. See the Note above on chap. 9.4.

Verse 26. He runs upon him, even on his neck:] Vulgar, He runs upon him
(God) with an erected-neck: such is his audaciousnesse and impudence, daring to
do any heinous wickedness, and not fearing to run against the strongest part
of Gods Armor, though able to grind him to powder. Sin has woaded such an
impudency in his face, that he dare with a full forehead encounter God, even
upon the points of his Justice and righteous Judgments, wherein he is the
ablest to give us the shock, etc. Thus some sense the Text. Others (of good
note also,) refer the word, runs, to God, and render it thus, God runs
upon him, even upon the neck, etc. He breaking his shields, how many and how
thick soever they be, drags him by the neck as a miserable vanquished wretch,
and lays upon him exquisite and high punishments, according to that chap.
31.3. Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers
of iniquity?

Upon the thick bosses of his buckler.] Wherewith the Belialist, this Champion
for hell, thinks himself best armed and secured, against the dint of the divine
displeasure. Bucklers, besides other bosses for ornament, had one great bosse
in the middle, with a sharp pike in it for use, to pierce and wound the
Adversary. Now God runs upon this also, and is no whit hindered thereby from
punishing the refractories, these high attempters, these monstrous men of
condition, that so fiercely and so fearlesly lift up their hands against
heaven, as if they would pull God out of his throne, and throw the house, yea,
the world out at the window. Surely, as Pride resists God in a special
manner, so does God in a special manner resist it, 1 Pet. 5.5. The reason
whereof is given by Boethius. All other vices (says he) fly from God, only
Pride flies at him, stands out, and makes head against him.

Verse 27. Because he covers his face with his fatness.] This is given in as
one chief cause of his insolency; he is a belly-god, he makes plaits upon the
panch, so Broughron renders it: He has larded his guts, so Calvin: He makes
it his business to pamper his body; his heart also is fat as grease. Psalm.
119.70. Been curavit cutem suam in hoc munde. Vat.
He is waxen fat, that is prosperity-proud, and kicketh, Dent. 32.15. Pride and
fullness of bread were Sodoms twin-sins. Ezekiel. 16.49. When people are
Provender-prick'd, (as we call it) they easily turn the grace of God into
lasciviousness. Jude 4. and that fullness breeds forgetfulness; as the fed
Hawk soon forgets his Master, and the Moon at fullest gets furthest off the
Sun. Sensuallists who love feast, Judge. 14.10. are void of the Spirit, Jude 19.
A full belly makes a foul heart. The rankest weeds grow out of the fattest
soil: and those that make their gut a gulf, well they may have collops in
their flanks, but they have leanness in their souls; indeed they have (as
Swine) their souls for salt only, to keep their bodies from putrefying.

And makes collops of fat on his flanks.] Heb And makes mouths, that is,
wrinkles upon his flanks: He is active about it, and makes it his business to
make provision for the flesh, Romans 13. ult. He labors for the meat that
perishes, Joh 16.27. He lives to eat, and laughs himself fat, till his heart
now hardened by the deceit fullness of his sin, becomes as insensible as
Dionysius the Heracleot, who felt not when men thrust needles into his fat
belly; or those Bears in Pliny, that could not be stirred with the sharpest
prickles.

Verse 28. And he dwells in desolate Cities] Such as had been before
desolated, but are now by him re-edified, to get him a name and renown amongst
men, Ad numinis contemptum and hominum terrorem. Merlin.
and to make himself formidable, as those do, who build themselves strong holds
upon high Rocks, as if they would wage war against heaven. Peradventure (says
Deodate here) he means those Kings of violent Empires, who repaired or built
great Cities after the Deluge, as Nimrod, Ashur and others, Genesis 10.8. Job
3.14. Isai. 23.13. and raised themselves upon other men's ruins. Eliphaz his
scope is to show, that a man that has great power amongst men, begins to think
himself strong enough for God also.

And in houses where no man inhabiteth] For he has driven away the Inhabitants
through his oppressions. This is that crying sin of Depopulatours, who build
themselves desolate places, Job 3.14. And Enclosers, who betray Towns, as Rome
did Carthage, with a distinction, We will save the City, but destroy the Town.
This has been noted as a great fault in our Nation, and therefore Goropius
thinks the English were called Angli. because they were good Anglers, and had
skill to lay diverse baits when they fished for others men's livings. But
that is his mistake (though perhaps wilful,) for we were so called from the old
Angli who came in with the Saxons, and were subdued by the Normans, whose Duke,
William the Conqueror, paid dear for his depopulations at New Forest, wherein
six and thirty Parish Churches had been demolished, and the Inhabitants
removed, to make room for beasts or dogs game. Diverse of his sons and Nephews
came there to untimely ends, so dangerous it is for men to prove Abaddons or
Destroyers.

Which are ready to become heaps.] Heaps of stones, the strongest structures
in the world are subject to ruin. Make sure of heaven, which the Philosopher
fondly dreamt to be made of stone (arch-work) and would one day come to rain.
But whatever becomes of the visible heavens, which shall be purged by the fire
of the last day, upon the invisible we may well write, as Hyppocrates tells
us it was engraven on the gates of a certain City, Intacta manet, it remains
untouched: And as the Venetians boast of their City, that she is still a
Virgin, because from the first founding thereof (which is 1200 years since, or
near upon) it never came into the hands of a foreign enemy.

Verse 29. he shall not be rich, neither shall his substance, etc.] If he be
rich, it is for a mischief, neither is it likely long to continue with him, for
God will blow upon, and blast his substance, which is the fort and strength,
Isai. 10.14. He resolvs he will be rich, 1 Timothy 6.9. and is set upon it: God to
cross him, says here, He shall not be rich, but I will make a poor fool of
him, according to that. Jer. 17.11. As the Partridge sits on eggs and
hatcheth them not; so he that gets riches and not by right, shall leave them
in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool. There is a curse
upon unlawful practices, though men be industrious, as in Jehoiachim; Jer. 22.
it is God that gives power to get wealth, Deuteronomy. 8.18. Our care can no more add
a penny to our estate, then it can a cubit to our stature, Mat. 6.27.

He shall not prolong the perfection thereof.] Vulgar, He shall not send forth
his root in the earth, A man shall not be established by wickedness (says
Solomon) but the root of the righteous shall continue. Prove. 12.3. See the Note
there.

Verse 30. he shall not depart out of darknesse] But be held under remediless
misery, being ever blasted and benighted, till God at last breathe forth upon
him his final displeasure. When God has brought wicked men into straits, there
he holds them; not so the godly, Psalm. 34.19. they are sure of deliverance in
due season. And as before the morning light, is the thickest darkness; so
before help, hardest trials. Post tenebras lux, Hom. 16.
is the Christians motto; not so the ungodly; they are ex tenebris in tenebras,
infeliciter exclusi, infelicius excludendi, as Austin has it, to pass out of
one darkness into another, till they be cast into utter darkness.

The flame shall dry up his branches] That Ventus urens and exi^cans of Gods
wrath shall blast and consume, not his Offspring only, but all his beauty and
bravery: he shall be as a tree that is thunderstruck. Zack. 11.16.

and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away] God will blow him to
destruction his very breath shall leave him breathless, Isai. 11.4. Psalm.
18.15. Job 4.9. See the Note there. Others understand it of the wicked man's
mouth, and make this to be the sense, He shall be so choleric and impatient in
his trouble, that he shall send out his last breath suddenly in a passionate
fit. So did Nerva the Emperor, likewise Valentinian, Wenceslaus King of
Bohemia, and our Henry the second.

Verse 31. Let not him that it deceived, trust in vanity.] Let it suffice him
that he has been once already deceived by the uncertainty of riches, which
were never true to those which trusted them, nor never will be, 1 Timothy 6.17. As
Charendas was wont to say of going to sea, (and another of going to Law) That
he wondered not at those that go once, but at those who go a second time. So may
we at those that having found the deceitfulness of sin, and the instability of
Creature Comforts, that they should again be drawn in and deceived. This folly
Eliphaz here forewarneth Job of, and would not have him twice stumble at the
same stone, but deliver his soul, (if ever God should restore him again) and
say, Is there not a lie in my right hand? Why feed I upon ashes? etc. Isai.
44.20.

For vanity shall be his recompense.] i.e. Poverty and misery shall be his
portion, as shame shall be the portion of fools, Prove. 3.35. As he has sowed
the wind, so he shall reap the whirlewind, whereof he is likely to have a great
catch, Hos. 8.7. See the Note there.

Verse 32. It shall be accomplished before his time.] Heb. in not his day. That
recompense forementioned of calamity and death shall be hastened, so that they
shall not live out half their days. Psalm. 55.22 but dye tempora non suo,
Eccles. 7.15. then when it were better for them to do any thing rather then to
dye, since they perish in their corruptions, they are killed with death, Rev.
12.33. See Prove. 10.37. Death ever takes a wicked man unprovided, Brent. in
loc.
Haec enim vena nobis ab Adam agnata est, ut nullam (...) ad suspendi^m aptam
invenium possimus: neque unquam caro ^^urtem eliget, nisi p^essa judicio. We
naturally dream of an immortality here, neither yield we to dye till there be a
necessity. Lavat. in loc.
Miserandum est autem, says one: but it is a pitiful thing that being all so
desirous of life, we should so little care for those things that would lengthen
out lives (such as are piety, justice, temperance, etc) we forget that short
way to long life, Psalm. 34.12.

His branch shall not be green] Heb. His crooked or bowed down branch; this is
his full estate or numerous issue, those boughs of his, laden and bowed down
with fruit, shall not be green, but blasted and dried up: ramificans ejus non
virescet: It is a misery to be the branch of a wicked stock, for such, as they
leave the rest of their substance to their little ones, Psalm. 17.14. So they
leave them Gods curse, as Joabs Legacy, 2 Samuel 3.29. or as Gehazies Leprosy, 2
King. 5.27. a wretched bequeath.

Verse. 33. He shall shake off his unripe grapes as the vine] Filios intelligit
per batra, and pueros per florem, says Vatablus: i.e. By unripe grapes he
means the wicked man's sons grown up; and by flowers of the Olive, his little
ones; and so it is the same with the former, only flourished over with two
similitudes. He (that is God) will snap off his sour grapes as she vines: so
Broughton renders it; Epist. 7.
Luct^osa foecunditas (such as was that of Laetae in Hierome, who buried many
children) is a sore affliction. If the bud or flower decay, what hope can there
be of fruit? Others understand it of the untimely death, as before, or of the
decay of his wealth and possessions.

Verse 34. For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate] Heb. Of the
hypocrite; where he seems to point at Job. as by the unripe grapes, and
blasted flowers of the Olive, he had understood Jobs children and possessions,
verse. 33. Now the whole congregation or train and retinue of the hypocrite, God
will nunest and ruinate, says Eliphaz: they shall all be as one desolated, so
the Original has it.

And fire shall consume the Tabernacles of bribery] Heb. The Tabernacles of a
bribe. Under these two heads, says one, we may reduce all sorts of sinners;
sinners against God under the notion of Hypocrites; and sinners against men
under the notion of Bribe-takers; (...), say the Septuagint; that is, Receivers
of Gifts; Muncra sunt honor aria vel corruptoria Lavat. in loc.
and the Hebrew word signifies, a Gift in general: it is taken also for a
bribe, because very many gifts are bribes. Now houses built by bribes or very
many gifts, shall be consumed and come to nothing; Jer. 22.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
Hab. 2.9, 10, 11, 12. See the Note there. This Eliphaz casts in Jobs teeth,
but herein he dealt with him as injuriously as Bonner did with Philpot the
Martyr, when he said to him, Act. and Non: sol. 16 50.
Also I lay to thy charge, that thou killedst thy father, and wast accursed of
thy mother on her deathbed, etc.

Verse 35. They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity] Here Eliphaz for a
close, by an elegant and usual Metaphor taken from child bearing, shows that
all such as conceive with guile or wrong to others, by that time they have
reckoned their months aright, though they grow never so big, shall bring forth
nothing but wind and vanity. Like as a woman that thinks she has conceived and
is deceived pleases her self with the thoughts of a child, but brings forth
nothing but wind, water, or some dead mass. Brentius exemplifieth this by the
Papists devising tot modos and formas confitendi and Missandi, so many ways
and forms of Confessing and Massing. Poor souls when stung by the Friars
Sermons, or otherwise troubled in mind, run to those practices for help, but
all in vain: for though stilled for a while, yet conscience recoileth upon
them, and making them miserable, leaveh them desperate, as Popery is a Doctrine
of desperation Mean while, till they are consuted by the event, wicked men
please themselves not a little in their sinful conceptions; they have a kind of
a sens^^ veneris (which Scaliger will have to be the sixth sense, In male
agendo voluptatem quaesierunt. Merlin. Spec. Europ.
besides those five commonly counted of) a sensual delight in the^ sinful
projects. As one speaking of the Council of Trent, says, That it was carried
on by the Pope with such infinite guile and craft, as that themselves will even
smile in the tryumphs of their own wits, (when they hear it but mentioned) as
at a master stratagem. these heathens (so they are called, Re^^ 11.2.) consider
not, that whites they thus ^umultuate, they do but imagine a vain thing Psalm.
2.1. and that the child's name is Vanity, as here.

And their belly prepares deceit] Not their head, but their belly prepares (
accurately and strongly prepares, so the word signifies) deceit, self-deceit
(so some sense it) or rather to deceive and undo others whom they cannot
overcome by might to overcome by ^eight And in these guileful projects they
delight and take a contemplative kind of pleasure, as the voluptuous person
does in his lust, Psalm. 52.1, 2.

CHAP. XVI. Verse 1. Then Job answered and said.]
ALthough he had little or nothing to answer unto but what he had answered
before, yet that he might not say nothing, he replyeth to Eliphaz his painted
speech, and gives him to know, That Prudentibus viris non placent phalerata
sed fortia (as B. Jewel was wont to say) that is, that wise men look for
matter, and not for words only, from those that accoast them.

Verse 2. I have heard many such things] Heard them over and over, till I am
even sated and nauseated, Vexatus toties rauci; q.d. Your sayings are
superfluous, your proofs insufficient; you produce nothing new, nothing but
what is trivial, and of very common observation; Hac sex centies audivi; Mine
ears are grated and grieved with these unnecessary repetitions, only
reinforced with greater bitterness; which as it adds nothing at all to the
weight of your words, so it causes me to add this,

Miserable Comforters are ye all.] Heb. Comforters of misery, or of
molestation, onerous and burdensome (so the Vulgar renders it) and in that
sense, weighty if you will, laying more load upon me who was before in a
sinking condition. You charge me for sleighting the consolations of God, and
pretend to come purposely to comfort me; but such cold comforters I have
seldom met with; for in stead of abating and allaying my sorrows, you do all
you can to increase and heighten them. Is this your kindness to your friend?
Calvin notes upon this Text, That some Comforters have but one Song to sing,
and they have no regard to whom they sing it. But Saint Jude's rule is, Of some
have compassion, making a difference, others save with fear, ver. 22, 23. which
whiles Jobs friends observed not, they were justly styled, Miserable Comforters.

Verse 3. Ampullatur in arti.
Shall vain words have an end?] Heb. Shall there be an end to words of wind?
Bubbles of words, big swollen speeches, full of pride, void of reason: when shall
we once have an end of them? They that would comfort another indeed, must not
multiply vain repetition (for these are very burdensome to a serious ear, much
more to a sad heart) much less bitter speeches, least of all taunts and
buffooneries, as verse. 4. For, like as if the eye be inflamed, the mildest
Medicine troubles it, so is it here: how much more when harsh and uncouth?

Or what emboldneth thee that thou answerest?] That thou rejoynest, having been
so fully answered before? Some men will never be said or set down; such is
their pertinacy, they will not lay down the bucklers, though beaten to their
heads. Sed prastas berbam dare, quam turpiter pugnare: Better yield, then stand
out with dishonor.

Verse 4. I also could speak as you do. etc.] Every whit as curiously and
furiously. I could scold and scoff as freely as you do, but I know no warrant
so to retort and retaliate; Being reviled we bless, being defamed, we entreat,
1 Corinthians. 4.12, 13. To render railing for railing, is to think to wash off
dirt with dirt.

If your soul were in my souls stead] Some read it optatively, as Isai. 64.1.
Would to God your soul were in my souls stead; for then I would heap up words
against you, and act your part upon you: but Job was not so malicious or
vindictive, as to think that tallying of injuries, is but justice. Hypocritis
nihil est crudelius, impatientius, and vindictae cupidius, says Luther.
Hypocrites are cruel, spiteful, and revengeful: but Job was none such. He
therefore tells his friends, that if they were in his condition, he would
deal much more mildly with them.

I could heap up words against you] I could, but would not. Posse and nolle,
nobile est. Genesis
Or thus, Would I heap up, etc. and handle you thus discourteously by speeches
and gestures, as you do me? It were easy to wag a wicked tongue, and to shake
my head at you in despite and mockery: but were this Religion? Does not moral
Philosophy say, If a wise man speak evil of thee, endure him: if a fool, pardon
him? Vin^it qui patitur, as David did Saul, overcoming evil with good, though
when he marched against Nabal, how rough and rash was he in a resolution of
revenge? 1 Samuel 25.32.

Verse 5. But I would strengthen you with my mouth] I would speak to your
hearts, and raise up your drooping spirits. True it is, that consolatiuncula
creat^rulae (as Luther calls them) creature comforts are poor businesses:
nevertheless God conveyeth comfort many times by one man to another, as the
air conveyeth light, or water heat. His comforts are either rational, fetched
from grounds which faith ministers; or real, from the presence of any thing
that comfort. as the sight and discourse of a friend. And herein, how
forcible are right words? chap. 6. 25. They are of force. we see here, both to
strengthen the feeble minded, and to abate the strength of their sorrows, to
assuage the most swelling floods thereof. And thus one man may be an Angel,
nay, a God to another. Now whereas some might say, You that are so good at
comforting others, and promise so fair, Why are you not comfortable? Job
answers, in the next verse, that this was their fault, who had unkindly kept
him off from receiving any comfort.

Verse 6. though I speak, my grief is not ass^agest] Heb. If I speak; scil. to
bewail my misery or to maintain mine innocence; ye say '^is good enough for me,
and how can I be but wicked, who am so punished? As,

If I forbear, what am I eased?] Heb. What goes from me? q.d. Ye conclude me
guilty, because silent; as if I had nothing to say for my self. Some make the
words to refer to God; as if Job had said, Whether I speak, or whether I
forbear, God does not come in to my help, I find no comfort from him, etc. and
by the next verse it should seem that this is the right sense.

Verse 7. But now be has made me weary] i.e. God, whom he acknowledges the
Author of his afflictions; but he should better have born up under them, Quis
cum fatigevis? Dolor, vel Them ipse? Lavat.
then to faint and fret even unto madness, as the Septuagint here translates.
Job was now not only wet to the skin, but his soul came into iron, as Joseph's
once, Psalm. 105.18. Like Ezekiels book, chap. 2. he was written quite through
with woes and lamentations. And he might say with heman, Psalm. 88.15. While I
suffer thy terrors I am distracted. The grief which he here describes, Major
erat, quam ut verbis comprehendi, gravior quam ut ferri, molestior quam ut
credi passes, says Brentius; i.e. In locum.
Was greater then could be uttered, heavier then could be born, more
troublesome then can be believed. He therefore sets it out as well as he can,
and amplifies it by figures and Hyperbolies, to move God and his friends to
pity him: and to show that he complained not without cause.

Thou have made desolate all my company] Heb. Thou have wonderfully desolated
or wasted all my company; that is, all my joints and members (so the Vulgar
translateth it;) but they do better that understand it of Jobs family and
familiar friends, In nibilum redacti sunt omnes artus mei.
who were either destroyed, or stood amazed at his so great affliction, and
yielded him little comfort. Ne te autem turbet enallage persona, faith Mercer
here; the change of person need not trouble us: only the troubledness and
unevenness of Jobs speech shows, that his spirit was troubled and unsettled.
We meet with the like often in the Psalms.

Verse 8. Thou have filled me with wrinkles which is a witness against me]
viz. that I am an afflicted man, but yet not a wicked man, such as Eliphaz had
described by his pingis aqualiculus, those collops in his flank, chap. 15.27.
Persius.
Thou bast made me all wrinkled (so Broughton renders it) or, Thou have
wrinkled me. The Hebrew word is found in Job only: but in the Rabbis more
frequently. Grief had made surrowes in Jobs face and his tears had often filled
them.

And my leanness rising up in me] scil. By the continuance of my sores and
sorrows, which have made my body a very bag of bones, and cause me to cry out,
My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me, Isai. 24.16. My flesh, through my
grievous anguish, being fallen from my bones, which rise up in a ghastly manner.

Bears witness to my face] scil. That I am one of Gods Plagipatidae, poor
Afflicted: But what of that? Scourges he not every Son whom he receives? Heb.
12.7. Others render it, Ium^ face; where my leanness sits, and is most
conspicuous: like as it is said of our Savior, That with fasting and pains
taking he had so wanzed and macerated himself, that at little past thirty, he
was looked upon as one toward fifty, Mr. Clark in his life.
John 8.57. And as Mr. John Fox the Martyrologue, by his excessive pains in
compiling the Acts and Monuments of the Church in the space of eleven years,
grew thereby so lean and withered, that his friends hardly knew him to be the
same man.

Verse 9. he reareth me in his wrath, etc.] Who did all this to Job? The devil
say some; his Disease, say others: (that was a most uncharitable censure passed
by Luther upon Occolampadius, Lib. de Missa. prin. Anno Dom. 1533.
that he died suddenly ignitis Satanae telis confessus, slain by Satan's fiery
darts, because he died of a Carbuncle.) But Job surely means it of God, upon
whom his heart was still, though he speak here somewhat unhappily of him, out
of the sense of the flesh, and greatness of his grief.

Who hates me] Heb. He Satanically hates me. What strange language is this
from him who elsewhere calls God his Salvation, his Redeemer, chap. 13.15,
16, 18. and 19.25. and will by and by call him his witness in heaven, to whom
his eye powers out tears, verse. 19, 20? How shall we reconcile these so
contrary passions and passages, otherwise then by saying, that every good man
is two men, etc? neither can it possibly be expressed how deeply sensible the
Saints are of Gods displeasure, when they are more then ordinarily afflicted by
him, and especially when he seems to fight against them with his own hand
Hereby (says Ferus) we may easily see in what a perplexed estate wicked
Reprobates shall be at the last day, when God shall declare himself to be such
an enemy to them indeed; for so much as one of his Elect, and a most rare man,
but conceiving him to be against him, because he had no present sense of his
favor, was thus extremely troubled.

He gnasheth upon me with his teeth.] as extremely angry, Act. 7.54. and by
sharpning his teeth threatening destruction, Psalm. 37.12.

Mine enemy sharpneth his eyes upon me] which cast forth as it were sparkles of
fire. An elegant Hypotyposis, or description of his sad condition to the life,
Vt non tam gestares quam nunc geri videatur, says Brentius, as if we saw it
even acted before our faces. Brent. in loc.


Verse 19. they have gaped upon me with their mouth.] They? who? Non solum
Dens, nec solum amici mei, sed tota rerum machinae mihi adversa^ur. Not God
only, nor these friends of mine; but all the creatures are up in arms against
me, and threaten to devour me at one morsel.

They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully] i.e. They have done me all
the disgrace that may be. See Lam 9.30. 2 Cor. 11.20, 21. Mic. 5.1. Act. 23.1,
2 John 18.22. Our Savior was so served according to the Letter; they gaped
upon him, mowed at him, buffeted him on the face, gathered themselves together
against him, as here. Hence some of the Ancients call Job a figure and Type of
Christ, who was thus dealt with both literally and also figuratively.

they have gathered themselves together against me] Or, They have filled
themselves upon me; Tigurin.
as Exodus 15.7. They have taken their fill of pleasure at my miseries, as one
renders it: Or, They come upon me by full troops; so Broughton. Men are apt to
agree for mischief, Psa. 35.15. and 83.5, 6, 7.

Verse 11. God has delivered me to the ungodly] i.e. To the Devil, and his
instruments, those Chaldean and Sabean Robbers, Chap. 1.15, 17. together with
his hard-hearted friends, who for want of the true fear of God, added to his
afflictions, chap. 6.14. See the Note there.

And turned me over, etc.] As a Magistrate does a Malefactor to the
Executioner. It is a sore affliction to be under the rule of wicked men: much
more to be under the rage, which yet was the case of that noble army of
Martyrs, ancient and modern. The comfort is, that although the Lord turn his
servants over into the hands of the wicked, whose tender mercies are meet
cruelties, yet he never ^^^es them out of his Own hand, neither will he suffer
the rod of the wicked to rest upon the lot of the righteous. Psa. 125.3. His
constant care is, that the choice spirits of his afflicted people fail not
before him, and therefore he numbreth out their strokes, and if their enemies
over do and go beyond their commission, so as to help forward the foreappointed
affliction, he is sort displeased and jealous with a great jealousy against
them; Zach. 1.15.

Verse 12. I was at ease, but be has broken me asunder] It is no small misery
to have been happy Fuimus Troes and fortis Milesis Euripides brings in Hecuba
as ashamed to look Polymnestor in the face, because of a Queen she was now a
Captive; her former felicity was no small aggravation of her present misery: So
was Jobs. Prosper eram, sed disrupit me, says he; I was wealthy, but he has
undone me; so Broughton renders it. The same Hebrew word signifies both to be
rich, and to be at ease; for such commonly sing Requiems to their souls, as he
did Luke 12.19. and say, I shall never be moved, Psalm. 30.6. I shall see no
sorrow, Rev. 18.7. But God can quickly confute them. Jobs worldly prosperity
was quickly dashed and lost He once hoped to have died in his nest, but God not
only unnested him, but broke him to shivers, yea beat him to dust and atoms,
as the word here signifies. Nay more,

He has also taken me by the neck.] As a strong man does his enemy, dashing
him to the ground, and giving him his Pasport, as we say.

And has shaken me to pieces.] Heb. He has scattered and scattered me. as a
stone crumbled to crattle, or a pitcher beaten to powder. Sunt illustres
figurae and elegantes hyperbolae, says Mercer. here is brave Rhetoric.

And set me up for his mark.] Heb. For a mark to him; that I may feel all the
arrows of his judgments. See chap, 7.20. with the Note there. God shot showrs
of shafts at him, and seemed to take pleasure in so doing; as a man does in his
shooting at a mark.

Verse 13. His Archers compass me round about.] i.e. His Instruments of my
woe, whether persons or things, but especially my grievous sores putting me to
intolerable pain: these are Gods Arrows or Archers, and do make my poor body
not unlike that shield of Sceva at the siege of Dyrrachium, Densamque ferens in
pectore sylvam. Luc.
which had two hundred and twenty darts sticking in it, when Caesar came to his
rescue.

He cleaves my reins asunder] As a skilful Archer, he hits the white, he
cleaves the pin, as they call it, he shoots exactly (to the very chining and
dissecting of my backbone) and so puts me to most exquisite pain and
torment, Lam. 3.13.

He pours out my gall upon the ground.] My bowels, says the Vulgar. The gall
is affixed to the liver, and when that is poured out; the man cannot live,
because his wound is mortal and incurable. Job held himself so, but it proved
better: the Lord chastened him sore, but he gave him not over to death, Psalm.
118.18.

Verse 14. He breaks me with breach upon breach] So that I have hardly any
breathing-while, Quis tot and tantis ferendis simul par sit? Let no man
henceforth say. Non babet in nobis jam nova plaga locum.
Never did any one suffer such hard and heavy things as I do. What I did not
Job? This story of his is a Book case to answer such an Objection, since never
any before, nor since his time was so handled; witness the lamentable moan he
makes here. And yet to show his equanimity under the hand of God, Buxtorf and
Amama have observed, that the Hebrew word, Perets, in this Text rendered,
breath, Buxtorf. Tiberios 167. Amama in Corand. Dissert.
has a letter lesser then ordinary in the best Copies. to signify, that Jobs
great calamities seemed to him to be but little, because he hoped that God
would turn them all to the best unto his soul.

He runs upon me like a Giant] With speed, strength and courage, fiercely
and fearlesly, But now what does Job? does he stand stouting and sturdying it
out with God? No, but in the next words he tells us how he was affected with
these afflictions; scil. that as Gods hand was heavy upon him so he held out
all the demonstrations and emblemes of an heavy heart; and as God had laid him
low, so he carried his soul accordingly. God reined him with a rough bit, and
he repented.

Verse 15. I have sowed sackcloth upon my skin] Not Silks. but sackcloth is now
mine immediate clothing, next my very skin, which must needs be troublesome to
a man so full of fores and other sorrows. So far was poor ulcerous Job from
that height and haughtiness of spirit, wherewith Eliphaz had charged him.
chap. 15.12, 23, 25. as if Job had been (...) indeed, but not lowly; hambled,
but not humble. Here was a real Apology, I have sowed sackcloth, etc. here was
an ocular demonstration, and should have moved his friends to more moderation:
for why should any deal harshly with him, who dealt so coursely with himself?

And defiled my horn in the dust.] My horn, that is, my head, say some. My
splendor, says the Chaldee; Omnia quondam magnifica, All that I formerly made
any reckoning of, says Brentius; who also has this good Note upon the Text.
The sense of Gods wrath and judgments due for sin, changes all our gayety,
makes all our costly garments be laid aside, puts us into the habit of
penitent Suppliants, causes us to abhor our selves, and repent in dust and
ashes, which were anciently the signs and symbols of true contrition. And now
since Christians ought to repent all their life long, and to grieve for their
sins, let them be always clothed with sackcloth, not without, but within; and
let them put dust on their heads, by remembering that they are but dust, and
that they cannot be raised out of the dust, and in stead of sackcloth, be
clothed with the robes of glory, but by the mercy of God, through the merits
of Christ, etc.

Verse 16. My face is foul with weeping.] Is swelled, says the Vulgar. Is
shriveled up, say the Jew-Doctors: is double dirtied, so one renders it. So
far was Job from stretching out his hand against God, and strengthing himself
against the Almighty, as Eliphaz h^d charged him, chap. 15.25. That he lay at
Gods feet as a Suppliant with blubbered and beslubbered cheeks; having furrows
in his face, and Isickles from his lips with continual weeping, yea, he had
wept himself blind almost, for so it follows;

And on mine eye lids is the shadow of death;] i.e. Mine eyes do fail with
tears, as Lum. 2.11. Mercer.
Larga lachry marum copia aci^^^oculorum obstruente; they are even wasted away
and sunk into my head, as in a dying man. Much weeping spends the spirits,
weakneth the visive power, and sometimes blinds, as it did Fanstus (the son
of Vortiger King of this Island by his own daughter.) who is said to have wept
himself blind for the abominations of his parents. See David's tears and the
effects thereof, Psa 6.7. and 38.10.

Verse 17. Not for any injustice (Heb. violence or wrong doing) in my hands]
Job could wash his hands of that rapine and bribery wherewith they had
injuriously charged him, 3. Sermon. before K. Edw.
chap. 15.34. and safely say of it, as afterward Father Latimer did of
Sedition; As for that sin, for ought that I know, me thinks I should not need
Christ, if I might so say. Some failings there might be in him in doing
justice, but no intendments of doing injustice.

Also my prayer is pure] As proceeding from an heart washed from wickedness,
Jer. 4.14. and presented with holy hands, lifted up without wrath or doubting,
1 Timothy 2.8. That he regarded not iniquity in his heart, he was well assured,
Psalm, 66.17. Prayer is the pouring out of the heart; if iniquity be harbored
there, prayer will have the sent and savor, and that incense will strike off
the hand which offers it. God requires, that in every place Incense be
offered unto his name and a pure Offering, Mal. 1.11. It stands a man in hand
to see that though his work be but mean, yet it be clean; though not fine, yet
not foul, soiled and shibbered with the flur of a rotten heart. An upright man
in afflictions is not without his cordial, as is to be seen in Job here, and 8
Paul, 2 Cor. 1.12.

Verse 18. O earth cover not thou my blood.] Job had made an high profession of
his innocenty and integrity. This he (...) confirms, 1. By an imprecation
against himself. 2. By an appeal to God, ver. 19 in this imprecation or wish of
his (which Mr. Broughton takes to be meant by the foregoing words. Also my
prayer is pure, rendered by him thus, Bar my wish is clean, saying. Oh earth
cover ^^t, etc.) he has an eye, no doubt to the History of Abelo blood, shed
by Cain. Gen 4. and it is as if he should say, If I have committed murder or
^hy the like wickedness, cover it not, O earth, but do thy office by crying
out against me; yea, cry so loud to God for vengeance, as to drown the voice
of my supplication.

And let my cry have no place.] A most pathetical speech, able to (...) the
heart of his friends to relent to hear it, and straightway to (...) their
opinion of him, whiles he thus bespeaketh the earth, and makes res (...), the
(...) and lifelesse creatures, his hearers.

Verse 19. Also now behold my witness is on heaven.] Here Is his appeal to God
so great is the confidence of a good conscience. We also may do the like, if
there be no other way left of clearing our innocence; provided that we do it
with a clear conscience, and in a matter of consequence; not in jest but in
judgment. Some of the Martyrs appealed thus, and cited their Persecutors to
answer at Gods Tribunal. Yea, to help the truth in necessity, a private Oath
betwixt two or more, may be lawfully taken, so it be done sparingly and warily:
for in serious affairs and matters of great importance, if it be lawful in
private to admit God as a Judge, why should he not as well be called to
withesse? Again, the examples of holy men show the practice of private Oaths
as not unlawful, Jacob and Laban confirmed their covenant by a private Oath, so
did Jonathan and David, etc.

Verse 20. My friends scorn me] Or, Play the Rhetoricians against me. David
likewise complains of his Rhetorical mockers at feasts, that made as it were
set speeches against him. One renders it, My friends are Interpreters, or
rather mis-interpreters of my speeches. For my love they are my adversaries,
but I give my solf unto prayer, Psalm. 109.4.

But mine eye powers h^ut tears unto God.] Expletur lachrymis egeriturque
dolor. The Hebrew has it. Mine eye droppeth, or distilleth to God. Prayers and
tears are the weapons of the Saints, whose eyes, glazed with tears, are fitly
compared to the Fish pools of Heshbon. Cant. 7.4. These tears have a voice (
Psalm. 39.12. Hold not thy peace at my tears,) they are most powerful Orators.
Christ going to suffer on the Cross, could not but turn back and comfort those
weeping women. God will power out comforts into their bosoms, who can pour
out tears into his: they can never be at any loss, who find out God to weep
to.

Verse 21. Oh that one might plead for a man with God] Heb. And he will plead
for a man with God, and the Son of man for his friend; that is, (say our late
learned Annotators, to whom we are greatly bound for this most sweet and
spiritual exposition of the words) Christ who is God and man will plead my
cause with his Father: He can prevail, because he is God equal to the Father;
he will undertake it, because he will be man like to me. This interpretation
agrees best with the coherence and the words following. And it seems that
Job knew the mystery of Christ's Incarnation, chap. 1.25, 26, 27. where he
speaks of him, both as God, and as a visible Redeemer. Christ is frequently
called the Son of man in the New Testament, and believers are called his
friends, John 15.13, 14, 15. By this Text thus expounded, we see that the
Doctrine of a Mediator between God and man was known and believed in the
world, long before Christ came into the world. He is the Lamb of God slain
from the foundation of the world. Rev. 13.8. and to the Jews the Ceremonial
Law was in stead of a Gospel.

Verse 22. When a few years are come, etc.] Heb. years of number; that is,
years that may easily be counted and cast up. The years of the longest live^
are but few, they may be quickly numbered. This ran much in Jobs mind, and made
him very desirous to be cleared before he dyed, that he might not go out of the
world in a snuff.

Then shall I go the way.] That way of all flesh, 1 Kin. 2.2. which Job fears
not to do, as knowing whom he had trusted, and that death should be unto him
the day break of eternal brightness.

Whence I shall not return. See chap. 7.9, 10. and 10.21. with the Notes.

CHAP. XVII. Verse 1. My breath is corrupt.]
WHich argues that my inwards are Imposthumated, and rotten, so that I cannot
in likelihood have long to live; Oh therefore that I might have a day of
hearing and clearing, before I dye. But Job should have remembered, that there
will be at the last day a resurrection of names, as well as of bodies; which he
that believes makes not haste. Howsoever it was not amiss for Job so
grievously diseased, and now well in years, to bethink himself of death, and to
discourse of these three particulars, that speak him a dying man. In the old,
the Palm tree is full of bloomes, the map of age is figured on his forehead,
the Calendars of death appear in the furrows of his face, the mourners are
ready to go about the streets, and he is going to his long home, according to
that elegant description, Eccles. 12. Varro de're rust. l. 1. c. 1.
He should therefore say with Varro, Annus octogesimus wie admonet, ut sarcinas
colligam, etc. It is high time for me to pack up, and to be gone out of this
life: Or rather, as Simeon, Lord, now let thou thy servant depart in peace, etc.

My days are extinct] As a candle, Prove. 13.9. Or, Cut off (as a web) so some
read it. The Original word is found only here.

The graves are ready for me.] Heb. The graves for me; q.d. I bid adieu to all
things else, and as the grave gapes for me, so do I gape for the grave, (...).
I would it were even so, as Basil said, when Valens the Arian Emperor threatened
him with death. But why does Job speak of graves in the plural? Surely, to show
that he was besieged with many deaths: or else, because the dead are buried (as
it were) first in their grave-cloathes, and then in the coffin, and then in the
Beir or Hearse, and lastly in the Sepulcher, which every place did, as it were,
proffer to Job, and threaten him with death, in regard of his many pains and
pressures, by the scoffs and taunts of his friends. For,

Verse 2. Are there not mockers with me?] Heb. If there be not mockers with me,
q.d. despeream, Let me be punished, or let me be blarned for wishing to argue
it out with God: so some Jew-Doctors sense it. job had before complained of his
friends jearing and girding at him, chap. 16.20. To be mocked in misery is no
small aggravation thereof. See what is threatened. Prove. 1.26. The Proverb is,
Oculus, fides. and fa^a non patiuntur jocot. There Is no jesting with a man's
eye, faith, and fame. Junius readreth the Text thus, For as much as there are
no mockings with me, I mean honestly, and deal plainly, and yet mine eye
continues in their provocations, neither can I be set right in their opinions,
so prejudiced they are against me.

And does not mine eye continue in their prevoc^^miums?] Heb. Lodge or tarry all
night in their provocations, or bitternesses? Broughton reads, In those man's
vexing lodges mine eye; that is, I lodge not so much in roy bed as in the
thoughts of my friends un^^^^nesse. And indeed (says one) a man may sleep
better upon bare boards, then upon hard words. Some refer it to the eye of his
mind lifted up to God in prayer: but yet no sweetness coming from him either
internally or externally. The former is rather to be followed.

Verse 3. Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee] This Job speaks not to
El^^^ (as K. Moses. Beza. and some others would have it) but to God himself, as
chap. 16.7. whom he desires to lay down or appoint (as Exodus 1.11.) and put in
Christ as a Surety to plead for him. See Heb. 7.22. and so Brentius expounds
it; There is one only surety (says he) one only Intercessor, the Lord Jesus
Christ, who if he appear not in the eyes of our faith, we have none else that
can undertake for us to God; neither is there any creature which can stand in
the judgment of God, though he would never so fain be Surety for us: Thus he.
And accordingly our late learned Annotatours reading the words thus: Appoint I
pray thee my Surety with thee; who is he then that will st^^ke upon my hand?
that is, Appoint Christ, who is with thee in heaven, and has undertaken to be
my Surety: appoint him (I say) to plead my cause and to stand up for me, and
then no man will dare to contend with me. And so it is futable to the Notes on
chap. 16.21. and to Romans 8.33. The Vulgar Latin, (not altogether from the
purpose, says Brentius,) translates the whole verse thus, Put me near thy
self, and then let whose will contend with me.

Verse 4. Thou have hid their heart from understanding.] that is, Thou have
hidden understanding from their heart, thou have left them in the dark,
destitute of a right judgment, whilst they condemn me for wicked, because
grievously afflicted; and thence it is that I do so confidently appeal to thee
in Jesus Christ, since my friends are so far mistaken in this controversy. If
God give not both light and sight, if he vouchsafe not to irradiate both Organ
and Object, the best will be bemisted. Every good gift and perfect comes from
above, even from the Father of lights, Jam. 1.17. It was he that made Reverend
Doctor Sibbs (as one says of him) Spiritually rational, and rationally
Spiritual; One that seemed to see the insides of Nature and Grace, and the
world and heaven, by those perfect Anatomies he had made of them all.

Therefore shall thou not exalt them] Therefore thou shall not give them
honor: so Broughton renders it. But that is not all, Liptoti est, says
Mercer; it is a figure, wherein less is said, and more is meant: Thou shall
not only not exalt them, but thou shall also abase and humble them: this
contestation shall be nothing at all to their commendation in the end. It is
the found knowledge of the truth according to godliness, that exalts a man,
and makes him to be accounted of; and the contrary. Howbeit many great and good
men have been greatly mistaken in very great controversies and transactions, as
was Luther, Doctor Resolutus, sed non in omnibus Illuminatus. And yet how many
Learned able men has his name misled in the point of Consubstantiation? Vrsin
was carried away with it a while, till he read his Arguments which he found to
be little better then Paralogismes. Holy Greenham. when pressed to conformity
to the Ceremonies by the Bishop of Ely. who urged Luthers approbation of them;
and are you wiser then Luther? His sober and gracious answer was, I reverence
more the revealed will of God in teaching Luther so many necessary things to
salvation, then I search into his secret will, why he hid his heart from
understanding in things less necessary.

Verse 5. He that speaks flattery to his friends.] As you my friends do to,
and for God, in seeming to assert his justice in punishing me for my
wickedness, so soothing and smoothing up the Almighty ( quod ipsum nibil aliud
est quam falso Deo blaudiri, says Merlin) and seeking to make the world
believe by your great words, that you are his great Champions, whilst you go
about to clear up his righteousness, by concluding me unrighteous, See chap.
13.7, 8. with the Notes.

The eyes of his children shall fail.] Not himself only shall smart (while the
Lord curteth off flattering lips, and the deceitful tongue, Psalm. 12.3.) but
his poor children shall rue for it. They shall lie languishing at Hopes
Hospital, and after all be disappointed, or their eyes shall fail with long
looking after good, but nothing comes. They shall look for peace, and there is
no good; and for a time of healing, but behold trouble, Jer. 14.19. God will
destroy flatterers, head and tail, branch and rush, like as the Thessalians,
once utterly destroyed the City called, Hen. Steph. Apol. pro Herod.
(...) or Flattery.

Verse 6. He has made me also a byword of the people.] Here Job returns to
his old task of setting forth his own misery; for what men are most sensible
of, that their tongues do most of all run upon. Job is a by word or a Proverb
to this day, for we say, As poor as Job; as of old they said, Iro panperior,
etc. He was become a common proverb, a public mocking-stock, yea he was pro
cantione and tympanum trita; as some sense the next words. And aforetime (or,
to men's faces) I was (or I am) ^ tabret: They sing my miseries to the Tabret,
as a matter of mirth; they compose Comedies out of my Tragedies, and this
greatneth my grief. I am openly a T^bret: so Broughton reads it. The Vulgar
has it, I am an example before them. The Chaldee Paraphrast, I am at hell
before them. The Hebrew word in Tophet, taken afterward indeed for hell, but
not so in Jobs t^me. The Septuagint, I became a sport to them; David met with
the like measure, Psalm. 69.19, 11. and the Church, Lam. 2.15. (...)
And Christ on the Cross was matter of mirth to the malicious Jews. God had
made Job all this. He (that is, God) has made me, etc. his name he spares in
reverence: but every where he acknowledges God the Author of his troubles, as
Mercer here notes. The whole verse may be read thus: He has made me also a
byword of the people, where as aforetime, I was as a Tabret; that is, I am now
a scorn to them who delighted in me in my prosperity.

Verse 7. Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow] Not only is my good name
blasted, but my body also is wasted: the nerves of mine eyes are contracted,
the visive faculty decayed, Psalm. 6.7. Mine eye is consumed because of grief,
yea my soul and my belly, R. Levi. Pagnin Vatab.
Psalm. 1.10. Not the visive only, but the vital powers ^re wasted (see chap.
16.16.) yea the intellective part, as well as the sensitive, understood by the
formations in the next clause, that is, the cogitations, say they according to
Genesis 6.5. But I rather take it according to our Translation, for the members of
the body.

And all my members are as a shadow] My membra are but umbra, they look more
like a Skeleton, an Anatomy, an Apparition, then a true body, nothing being
left but skin and bone so much meager'd are all my members. This is hyperbolica
ma^orum suorum amplificatio, says Merlin.

Verse 8. Upright men shall be a stonied at this] They shall silently admire
and adore the fathomlesse depth of the divine administration, when they see a
man so upright to suffer such heavy pressures: yet shall they not censure me as
you do, not condemn me for complaining, since there is a cause. They cannot
indeed see far into Gods secret intentions, they do therefore mirari rather
then rimari, like as the old Romans dedicated unto Victory a certain Lake, the
depth whereof they could not fathom.

And the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite] He shall learn
of me, not to be baffled out of his sincerity; to be mocked out of his
integrity, but to maintain and take comfort therein against all his false
Accusers. Opposition does not weaken, but waken Heroic Spirits, 2 Samuel 6.21,
22. They proceed so much the more vigorously in the ways of Holiness; like as
Lime burns the more for the cold water cast upon it, and as the Palm Tree,
which although it have many weights at the top, and many snakes at the bottom,
yet it stirs up it self, and flourishes, taking for its Posie, Nee premor,
nec perimor. Nothing hurts or hinders me.

Verse 9. The righteous also shall hold on his way] Stumble he may for a time
at his own calamity, and worse men's felicity; but as he that stumbleth, and
yet falls not, gets ground; so fares it with the righteous in this case.
Once David said, Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands
in innocence: For all the day long have I been plagued, when had men have been
prospered. Hence he began to repent of his repentance, and to miscensure the
generation of Gods children as thrice miserable, Psalm. 73.13, 14, 15. but after
a while, and upon better consideration, he said, This is mine infirmity; yea,
he befooled and be beasted himself, ver. 22. for so saying. And the like will
all those at length do, that belong to God, though for the present offended at
Gods proceedings, and by their passions miscarried to their cost; yet they
return to their right minds: forwards they may fall sometimes, but not
backwards, for that were far more dangerous. Lord, to whom should we go, says
Peter? since thou alone have the words of eternal life, John 6.68. Neither know
we where to mend our selves, by gadding about to change our way, Jer. 2.36. The
righteous shall hold on his way, merdicus tenebit, he shall hold it toughly,
hold it as with tooth and nail, not going aside a nails breadth; (...), he
shall stick to it, as the Greek has it.

And he that has clean hands] Upright Innocent. Righteous, clean handed,
these all are the good man's adjuncts and Titles of honor, far beyond those of
the worlds greatest Magnifico.

Shall wax stronger and stronger] Heb. Shall add strength, Not only shall he
hold his own, but get more grace; not only persevere, but proceed and make
progress. He shall take boldness, Sumet audaciam.
say the Septuagint, and (by an holy Antipenstasis) get heart of grace, as they
call it, from the evil attempts of others against him; the more outrageous
they, the more courageous he; like as by Saint Paul's bonds many waxed
confident, Phil. 1.14. and as the Primitive Christians, the more they were
killed up, the more numerous they became. True zeal is of a most masculine,
Plures efficimur quoties mctimur. Tertul.
and courageous nature: it is inkindled, by quench-coales, quickened by rubs
and remora's. Ba^uc repaired earnestly, bursting out into heat, nehem. 3.20.
Shall such a man as I fly? said that heavenly Spark, chap. 6.11. Shall I
change my opinion, because hoc Ithacus velit? Remit of my diligence, because of
a frown or a frump? because such a Persecutour threatens me? Oh that I might
enjoy those wild beasts prepared for my death, said Ignatius! Oh that I might
have the maidenhead of that kind of suffering for Christ, said that Martyr to
Bonner, threatening to whip him, etc.

Verse 10. But as for you all, do ye return, etc.] Change your minds, as Mal.
3. 18. and close with me, lay aside your prejudicate opinions, deliver up you
selves to my discipline, who am ready to teach you things both weighty and
necessary, Siquis culturae patientem accommodet aurem.

For I cannot find one wise man amongst you.] Nihil hic ex odio dicit. says an
Interpreter. This Job speaks not out of hatred to their persons, but freely
utters that which he was persuaded to be the truth, and wishes them a better
understanding of the thing controverted betwixt himself and them at this time.
Now it is no fault to speak of men as we find them. See 1 Cor. 6.5. I speak to
your shame. is it so that there is not a wise man among you? and yet chap.
10.15. I speak as to wise men, judge you what I say.

(...). Theog.
Verse 11. My days are past] q.d. Its past time of day for me to hope for a
return of a prosperous condition, since I am irrecoverably diseased, and cannot
be long of life.

My purposes are broken off.] Or, My thoughts are plucked up by the roots. even
the Possessions of mine heart. that is, those thoughts that should wholly
possess me, and take me up entirely, seizing upon my spirit; q.d. I am not now
in case to think settledly and seriously of any good, my sorrows are so many,
and my sores so grievous. The Chaldee has it, The Tables of my heart are
broken. How foolish then are they who put off their repentance till they are
cast upon their sick-beds, when they may soon find enough to do to attend the
pain and infirmity of their bodies? To suffer and be sick, (says One) is work
enough for any man at one time: he had not need to have his greatest work to
do, when he has such work to do.

Verse 12. They change the night into day.] i.e. My troubled thoughts render my
nights restless, filling me with confusion, when the mind is unsettled the man
cannot rest.

The light is short because of darknesse] i.e. Comfort is long ere it comes,
Bern.
and soon it expireth: Rara hora. brevis mora. The Vulgar, Post tenebras spero
^ucem, here, After darkness I hope for light (the ancient Motto of the Town of
Geneva) is far fetched.

Verse 13. If I wait, the grave is mine house.] In that congregation house of
all living, (as it is called chap. 30.23) both I and my hopes must be suddenly
lodged. Some render it thus, If I build, the grave is my house. Solomon calls
it, T^^ house of eternity, Eccles. 12.5. And the Egyptians accordingly call
graves, everlasting houses, as (...) says Lib. 1.

I have made my bed in darkness] The grave was Jobs house, and therein he had
made his bed to rest from his labors. There men follow their works no more,
because followed by their works, Rev. 14.14.

Verse 14. I have said to corruption, Thou art my father] See how he bespeaks
corruption and the worms, Ac sijam juris illorum, and Domesticus esset as if
he were of family with them, and nearest of kin to them; so does he court them,
as it were, that they might be willing to receive him: showing withal how
willing himself was to dye; for whether do men in a strange Country, and in
misery, desire rather to go, then to the house of their parents? Here also Job
declares what will be the end of all men, and what shall be their kindred in
the grave. Of corruption we came (for what else is the seed and blood of
generation?) to corruption also we go, as sons thereof; and Pulvu and Putredo
we salute for sisters, that shall be most tender of us, and attendant upon us.
Why then should any boast of high kindred? To the pit I cry, O father. O
sister; O mother to the worm, so Broughton renders it Why should any boast of
bodily beauty, since corruption will shortly seize upon the fairest face, which
is now but putrefaction and worms, once removed, and to the same must suddenly
move back again. Mihi experto credit, says Austin, Believe me who have made
trial of it? Open a grave, and upon the dead man's head you shall find toads
leaping begotten of his brains; upon his loins Serpents crawling, begotten of
his raines; Sermon. 48. ad frat. in crem.
in his belly worms abounding, arising out of his entrails. Behold what now
we are, and what we shortly shall be; Behold the Original and filthiness of
sin, etc.

Verse 15. And where is now my hope, etc?] Heb. And where is my hope? scil. of
restoration to my pristine prosperity, which you have so often promised me,
who am now ready set upon the confines of death? Job was past the Cape of good
hope, in his own apprehension; but God turned again his captivity, chap. 42.
Qui nil sperare potest desperet nihil. Job did well to propound death to
himself, and prepare for it by such aforementioned familiarity: but yet he
should have better bethought him of the infinite power and goodness of God,
who raises the dead, and delights to help such as are forsaken of their
hopes. Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we
trust, that he will yet deliver, 2 Cor 1.10. The Hebrew word that signifies
hope, signifies also a line, because by hope the heart should be stretched out
as a line to the thing it hops for; And because it signifies also a
Congregation, Jerem. 3.17 Genesis 1.19.
therefore some render this verse thus, And where now is my congregation? And
as for my congregation, who shall see it? q.d. I have no other family or
familiars, but what are to be found in the grave.

Verse 16. They shall go down to the bars of the pit.] That is, I and my
things, or I and my hopes of prosperity, verse 15. and they that will see the
good I hope for, most pass through the gates of death to behold it, and lie
down in the grave with me, Per irrisionem baec dicta sunt.
and then it shall appear. Cajetan thinks that this is spoken ironically to his
friends, and by way of irrision; q.d. Belike you think I shall be rich in the
grave (who promise so much to me, and make me such overtures of an happiness
here) for I have no hope to be rich in this world. And the Septuagint seem to
favor this sense, rendering it, Shall my goods go into the grave with me? See 1 Timothy 6.7. with the Note.

When our rest together is in the dust] Or, When I shall rest alone in the
dust, (as chap. 34.29.) and then -- Modo quem fortuna fovendo. De Annibal. Sil.
Ital.

Congestis opibus donisque refor sit opimis,
Nudum tartarea, portabit ^^vita cymba.


CHAP. XVIII. Verse 1. Then answered Bild ad the Shuhite, and said.]
NOT so much disputing, as inveying against Job in a sharp and angry Oration,
wherein he elegantly describes the woe of a wicked man, but wrongfully
wresteth the same against good Job. who might well say with him in Tacitus; Tu
linguae, ego aurium dominus. If I cannot command thy tongue, yet I can command
mine own ears: Or with Another, Didicit ille maledicere, and ego contemnere;
This man has learned to reproach, and I to slight his contempts and
contumelies; unless I should yield that wicked men only are grievously
afflicted in this life present, that they are not to be reckoned wicked, who
prosper in their way; but those only who sufer extremely.

Verse 2. How long will it be are you make an end of words?] First he taxes
Job of talkativenesse, when himself talked much, but spoke little, (...). De
Alcibiade Plutarch.
save only what he had spoken before, chap. 8. Though Job had sufficiently
refuted him But as nothing in the world is more unreasonable then an ignorant
person, who thinks nothing well done, but that which he does himself; so
those that bear themselves over-bold upon their own knowledge, and over ween
their own abilities account it a great injury if any dissent from them in
opinion and judgment. And such a one here Bildad shows himself to be by his
exordium ex ab^^pto. as Junius phraseth it, his abrupt beginning, as if he
could bear no longer with Jobs prittle prattle; who if he were more prolix
then his friends, he had greater reason, as being heavily afflicted, and falsely
accused, Quando tandem finem loquendi seu nugandi potius facies? Lav.
Among the Romans the Plaintiff was allowed but three hours, the Defendant six.
But why does Biland bespeak ^ob here in the Plural Number? Was it for Honors
sake (as Cajetan holds?) I scarce think it. Was it because he thought Job to
be possessed by an evil spirit (as Philip after Bode?) No neither. But this he
seems to do, either as bending his speech to the bystanders, who seemed to
favor Job, and sometimes to put in a word for him; whom therefore Bildad
looked upon as his fellow hypocrites: or else, by an irony he speaks unto Job
as unto many, Vos o Calliope precor. Virg.
because he seemed to set up his opinion above all theirs, and would needs have
his counter to stand for a thousand pounds.

mark and afterward we will speak] Let thy words be henceforth dipped and died
in thy heart before they be uttered: let our words also be duly weighed, that
some end may be put to these altercations and disputes.

Verse 3. Wherefore are we counted as beasts, etc?] Here he taxes Job of pride
and arrogance; grounding upon those words of his taken at the worst, chap.
12.7. and 17.4, 10. and not considering his case, that he was full of pain,
which makes wise men tetchy (as oppression makes them mad, Eccles. 7.7.) and
that they had sorely provoked him by their bitter taunts, and scurrilous
invectives, which called for so sharp a curry-comb. Pessime antem habes by
po^risin. si contemnatur; Hypocrisy loves not to be sighted, faith Brentius
here. And Gregory upon this Text faith. Thus in Bildad Heretics are set forth,
who stomach it much that the faithful take upon them to reprove them, as
carried away by error; as if the knowledge of the truth resided in themselves
only, and all others had no more understanding then beasts. This people which
know not the Law are cursed, say those Pharisees, John. 7.49. John 11.49.
Ye know nothing at all, says Caiaphas to his Assessors. The Gnostics and
Illuminates gave out themselves, to be the only knowing men, etc. But if Bildad
had been right set, he would neither have so far misconstrued Jobs words, nor
yet have been behind to befool and be beast himself as Asaph in like case did,
Psalm. 73.22. Where he uses the Plural of the word here used in the Singular,
calling himself, Behemoth, id est, magna^ and crassam bestiam, a great and a
gross beast.

And reputed vile in your sight] Heb. Polluted or unclean; that is, as beasts
unfit for food, much less fit for sacrifice. The same Hebrew word signifies,
polluted and vile. Every wicked man is a vile man, be he never so high and
honorable in the worlds account, as Antiochus, Dan. 11.21. is called a vile
person, and yet he was the great King of Syria, firnamed Epiphanes, or
Illustrious, and by the flattering Samaritans, he was styled, Antiochus the
mighty God. See Psalm. 15.4.

Verse 4. He teareth himself in anger.] Here he charge Job with desperate
madness, as if through extreme impatience he fell soul upon his own flesh, as
did that Demoniack in the Gospel, Bajazet the great Turk in his iron Cage, Pope
Boniface the eighth, when clapped up close Prisoner in Saint Angelo: and as they
say the Tiger does, when he hears a dram struck up, he teareth his own flesh
with his teeth: or at all ravenous Deasts tear in pleces the prey which they
have taken. Many read the Text thus, O the man which teareth his soul in his
anger. Or. O thou which tearest thy self. Labia mirdet, caput quassat,
vestimenta scindis, and se in cotumnas impingit. Sen^^.
etc. The Moralist describes an angry man forcibly held by his friends, biting
his own lips, rending his clothes, and dashing himself against the pillars,
etc. Such a one Bildad makes Job to be, (...) or Mankind, as we say: and he
takes occasion likely, from those word of his, chap. 13.14. But love would have
thought no evil. Bildad herein sinned against the Law of love, las likewise he
does much more in the following vehement interrogation, charging Job with
insolent boldness against God.

Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?] Shall God cast off the care of his
earthly Kingdom to gratify thee, and to make good thine Assertion, That good
men may suffer, and bad men go unpunished? Never think it: thou may sooner
expect him to overturn the whole world for thy sake, and put every thing out of
that order he has decreed and made it in, then cease to be just in punishing
the wicked. The course of Justice is as firmly settled as the course of Nature
is. Fias justitia, periac mand^^. Of Fabricim it was said, That the Sun might
as easily be turned out of his track, as he out of his path of Justice; much
more they it be so said of Almighty God, the Rock that cannot be removed,
though he varieth the manner, the means, the times and seasons of executing
Justice, as seems best unto his heavenly wisdom.

Verse 5. Tea the light of the wicked shall be put out.] The ensuing
description of a wicked man's unhappiness in life; at death, and after death,
is very true, and daintily set forth, but falsely and wrongfully wrested against
Job, You, or, of a surety, the light of the wicked shall be put out: though
thou will not hear of it, but the truth shall be spoken, however it be taken,
and thou shall hereby see thy self to be a wicked man, Merlin.
because thy light is extinct, that is, thy outward prosperity fitly compared
to light; because 1. It cheareth our minds. 2. Directs our hands to every
business. 3. Lesseneth our frights. 4. Renders us conspicuous. The light of
the wicked shall put out it self, (so some render it:) he is commonly the cause
of his own ruin.

And the spark of his fire shall not shine] He is quenched as the fire of the
thorns, Psalm 118.12. Whereof after a while, neither spark nor spunk remains.

Verse. 6. The light shall be dark in his Tabernacle] The glory of his family
shall be obscured: he and his shall come to utter and unexpected ruin, as
Hamans did.

And his candle shall be put out with him] He and his prosperity shall dye
together: he shall go out in a snuff, and leave nothing behind him but a
detestable name. Sicat fetis fugrens vedit, sit ille moritas hone erepitium
cecenit, says Melancthon concerning Echius his last piece, De conjugio ficet
duum, Or, his candle shall be put out above him, so the Vulgar Interpreter: the
Lamps which glistered over head, during the pride and pomp of his Feasts, shall
give us more light: or if they give any, it shall be but to shine upon his Tomb.

Verse 7. The steps of his strength shall be str^^^ed] that is, says Vatablus,
he shall not do what he would and was wont. He shall lost his courage in the
midst of his enterprises, and not be able to effect his attempts.

And his own counsel shall cast him down] His cunning shall fail him, his
counsel, whereby once he rose, shall serve but to advance his overthrow, and to
precipitate him into misery. We use to say of a cunning-pated fellow, that he
never wants a trick wherewith to help himself; but there is neither power not
policy against the Lord and his judgments. Of the Athenians it is said, that
Minerva turned all their evil counsel into good unto them. Gods enemies have no
such friend to help them at a dead lift. The stone cut out of the mountain
without hands, shall bring down the golden Image with a powder, and make it
like the chasse of the Summerfloor, Dan. 2.35.

Verse 8. For he is cast into a net by his own feet.] Wicked men are even
ambitious of destruction: judgments need not go to find them out: they run to
meet their bane. Divine Justice and their own indiscretion undo them. He has
sent his feet into the net. so the Vulgar renders it. He is sent into a net by
his own feet, so Mr. Broughton. His own iniquities shall take the wicked
himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins, Prove. 5.22. these
shall cast him into inextricable straits.

And he walks upon a suare.] Upon a platted grin, says Broughton; whereout
the more he strives to get, the more he entangleth himself. Sen de ira lib. 3
cap. 6.
Sic laqueas fera dum jactat astringit. Sic aves viscum dum trepidantes
excutiunt, plumis omnibus illinunt. So the beast whilst he tosseth the snares
wherein he is taken, straitneth them: So the birds, while they think to shake
off the birdlime, besmeare all their feathers with it.

Verse 9. The grin shall take him by the heel] Or, He shall lay hold on the grin
with his heel. so Mercer reads it: that is, he foolishly runs upon his own
ruin, he perishes by his own oversight.

And the Robber shall prevail against him] Horridi sitibundi, the shaghaired
Ruffians that have wasted their own estates, and now thirst after other men's.
Broughton reads it, The savage shall lay hold on him. So that either by
secret contrivance, or open violence he shall be undone.

Verse 10 The snare is laid for him in the way, etc.] This heap of words, net,
snare, grin, trap, cords, shows that God has many ways to catch the wicked
with; and that nusquam and nunquam non eis impendeat exitium, destruction is
ready to meet them at every turning. God cannot want a weapon to beat a Rebel.

And a trap for him in the way] He walks as it were upon a Mine of Gunpowder.
The Hebrew has it, His trap; such as most of the Cesars. till Constantine the
great met with; and among the rest Maximinus (that Mastive Tyrant eight foot
high) who daily devoured forty pounds of flesh, and drank thereto six gallons
of Wine. This soul beast after he had raised the sixth Persecution against the
Christians, especially against the Pastors of the Church, and exercised many
other great cruelties, was told to his teeth, Mi^^m in theatro.
Elephas grandis est, and occiditur;
Leo fortis est, and occiditur:
Cave multos, si singulos non times.
And it befell him accordingly; for at the siege of Aquileia in Italy, Eusebius.
he was slain as he slept at noon in his Tent by his own soldiers. Ezekiel
foretells the degenerate sons of Josiah. that they shall be taken by the King
of Babylon as beasts in a toil. So Pharaoh, that natural brute beast, was made
to be taken and destroyed. 2 Pet. 2.12. with Exodus 9.16. So Saul complains
that God had forsaken him, and the Philistines those savage creatures, were
upon him, 2 Samuel 28. Behold I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt
them, etc. Jer. 16.16.

Verse 11. Terrors shall make him afraid on every side.] These terrors are, as
it were, the cruel Sergeants and merciless Officers of that King of terrors,
Apparitores and lictores. Jun.
verse 14 arresting him as it were in the Devils name, and bringing him to
justice. How can it be but a terrible time with him; when death comes with a
Writ of Habeas Corpus, and the Devil with a Writ of Habeas animam? when the
cold earth must have his body, and hot hell hold his soul, according to that of
the Psalmist, Let death seiz^ upon them, and let them go down quick into hell;
for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them, Psalm. 55.17. The sad
forethought hereof causes many unutterable griefs and gripings, perplexities
of spirit, and convulsions of soul, a very hell above ground, and a foretaste
of eternal torments. The word here rendered terror, signifies utmost
affrightments, such as put a man well nigh out of his wits and distract him. R.
Solomon understands it of devils; others of furies, such as the Poets fain.
Most certain it is, Cic. Orat. pro Rosc. Amer.
that a body is not so tormented with stings, or torn with stripes, as a mind
with remembrance of wicked actions, and fear of future evils.

And shall drive him to his feet.] As they did Cain that Caitiff, Qui factus
est a cord s^^ fugitivus, Tertul.
who would fain have fled from his own conscience (if he could have known
whither) and became a Fugitive and a Vagabond upon the earth, Genesis 4.12.
seeking to outrun his terrors, which yet dogged him hard at the heels. They
shall press him at his feet, so Broughton reads this Text.

Verse 12. Fit famelicum robur ejus.
His strength shall be hunger-bitten] Heb. His strength (or wealth) shall be
famine. Or, Famine shall be his strength. He, who whilom having health and
wealth at will, fared deliciously and gathered strength, shall be
hunger-starved, and hardly have prisoners pittance; so much only as will
neither keep him alive, nor suffer him to dye. See 1 Samuel 2.5.36. It Is as much,
faith Brentius, as we use to say of an extreme poor or feeble person, his
wealth is poverty, his strength weakness.

And destruction shall be ready at his side] i.e. Shall suddenly and inevitably
seize upon him, there will be no running away from it, for can a man run from
his side? The word signifies not an ordinary calamity, but a dreadful and
direful destruction. Some understand it of the Plurisie, or Ulcers in the side
of a man: Others of ribrost, as they call it, tortures inflicted on condemned
persons (as Heb. 11.34) who are beaten with bats.

Verse 13. It shall devour the strength of his skin] i.e. his bones which
support his skin; these destruction shall devour or swallow up at a bit, as an
hungry Monster.

The first born of death shall devour his strength] i.e. The Devil. say some,
that Destroyer, Rev. 9.11. that old Manslayer, John 8.44. Prince of death,
Heb. 2.14 (as Christ is called Prince of Life, Act. 3.15) and first born of
death, as Christ is the first born of the Resurrection, Col. 1.18. Others
understand it, De cruentissima at funestissima morte, of the most tragic and
cruel kind of death. See Isai. 14.30. Broughton reads it, A strange death
shall cat the branches of his body, judgments shall come upon thee in their
perfection, says God to Babylon, Isai. 47.9.

Verse 14. And his confidence shall be rooted out of his Tabernacle] Whatsoever
he trusts in about his house shall be pulled up by the roots, or grub'd up.
Thus it befell Doeg, Psalm. 52.7. And this disappointment, this broken confidence
of his, shall bring him (or make him go) to the King of terrors; i.e. to death
that most terrible of terribles, Aristot.
as the Philosopher calls it. Or the Devil (as R. Solomon interprets it)
that black Prince, Ephesians. 6.12. to whom wicked men are brought by death, which to
them is not only Natures Slaughterman, but Gods curse, and hels Purveyour.
hence Rev. 6 8. death haleth hell at the heels of it.

Verse 15. It shall dwell in his Tabernacles, because it is none of his] Heb.
Not his: for why? the King of terrors has turned him out of it, and taken it
up for an habitation for himself. Some render it thus, nothing or have nothing.
(that is want) shall dwell in his Tabernacle, his house shall be replenished
with emptiness, scarcity shall be the furniture of his habitation.

Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation] As is also threatened, Psalm.
11.6. And as was executed upon Sodom and her sifters: as also upon Dioclesian
the Tyrant; who giving over his Empire, Eusebius. de Vita Constable. lib. 5
decreed to lead the rest of his life quietly. But he escaped not so, for after
that his house was wholly consumed with lightening, and a flame of fire that
fell from heaven (not without a sulphurous smell) he hiding himself for fear of
the lightning, dyed within a little after.

Verse 16. His roots shall be dried up beneath, etc.] The meaning is, says
D^odate, he shall be deprived of Gods grace, which is the root of all
happiness, and of his blessing, which is the top of it.

Verse 17. His remembrance shall perish from the earth] As a tree when root and
branch is gone is clean forgotten, and no man remembers where it grew; so
shall it be with the wicked, Mercer.
Non celebrabitur ejus nomon and fama, nise in malum, Eccles. 8. 10. It is
reckoned as a great benefit to a wicked man, to have his memory dye with him,
which if it be preserved, stinks in keeping, and remains as a curse and
perpetual disgrace.

And he shall have no name] i.e. no honorable Name, no renown. A good name
only is a name, Eccles. 7.1. as a good wife only is a wife, Prove. 18.22. Every
married woman is not a wife. Zillah Lamechs wife, was but the shadow of a wife,
as her name also signifies. In like sort, those only have a name in the
streets or public places, who are talked of for good; as the Martyrs, who have
left their names for a blessing. Isai. 65.15. when as their wretched
Persecutors have left a vile snuff behind, their Lamps being put out in
obscurity.

Verse 18. He shall be driven out of light into darknesse] Heb. They shall
drive him: scil the devils shall drive him out of the light of life into outer
darkness, as they did that rich wretch. Luke 12.20. confer Mat. 8.12. and
25.30. The Dutch Translation reads it, Men shall drive him. Others understand
it of his troubles and sorrows.

And chased out of the world] As Tarquin was by Collatine, as Ph^^as was by
Heraclius, kicked off the stage of the world as one phraseth it; or as Job says
of some wicked, buried before half dead, chap. 27.15. Men shall chap their
hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place, verse 23.

Verse 19. he shall neither have son nor Nephew, etc.] A sore affliction to be
written childlesse, which yet is the portion of some good people, as Abel; many
Prophets and Apostles, for whose comfort that is written, Isai. 56.4.5. God, as
he will be to his childlesse children better then ten sons; so he will give
them in his house, 1 Samuel 1.8 Isal. 96.5.
and within his walls, a place and a name, better then of sons and of daughters
the will give them an everlasting name that shall never be cut off. Not so the
ungodly, those men of Gods hand; for though full of children, they leave the
rest of their substance to their babes, Psalm. 17.14. yet it will prove to be
but luctnosa foecunditas, as Hierom speaks, they shall weep for their lost
children, and not be comforted, because they are not. Or if they survive, they
prove singular cuts and crosses to their wretched Parents, who have cause
enough to cry out as Moses sometimes did, let me dye out of hand, and not see
my wretchedness, Number. 11.15. They are filled with ^^medicinable sorrows, in
the loss either of their children or of their estates by their wasteful
children, so that they praise the dead above the living, and wish they had
never been born, Eccles. 4.2, 3.

Nor any remaining in his dwellings] When the soldiers slew the Tyrant
Maximinius and his son, at the siege of Aquil^ia, they cried out, Ex pessima
geneve ne catulum quidem habendum, Of so ill a kind, let not a whelp be kept
alive.

Verse 20 There that come after him shall be ast^^ied at his day] Future Ages
hearing the relation of his dismal destruction, shall stand aghast, as if they
beheld the dirty ruins of some once beautiful City. Happy they, if in good
earnest they could make that good use of it, which Herodotus the Historian
says, (...) Herod.
men should make of the overthrow of Troy; viz. to take notice thereby, that
great sinners must look for great punishments from God. But Ham and his
Posterity were little the better for the Deluge in their days: not the
adjacent Countries for Sodoms downfall.

As they that went before were afrighted,] scil. His contemporaries and
eyewitnesses of his calamity apprehended horror, so the Hebrew has it, they
took a fright: which yet was little to the purpose without faith and
repentance; and unless their hearts fell down, when their hairs stood upright.

Verse 21. Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked] As sure as death it is
so; and this is often inculcated, because hardly believed. Bildad hints at Job in
all this, and therefore speaks of the wicked here in the singular number; as
who should say, Thou art the man. But Jobs innocence served him for an
Heptab^ean Buckler.

And this is the place] that is, the state. Psalm. 14.4


Of him that knows not God] Periphrasis impii, says Drusius: this is the
character of a graceless man. have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? No
none, that they were a button the better for.

CHAP. XIX. Verse 1. Then Job answered and said.]

HE replied as follows, to Bildads bitter, and tanting invective. His
miseries he here sets forth graphically and tragically, grating to Bildad
that he was dealt with no otherwise then if he were that wicked man described
in the foregoing chapter: and yet denying himself to be any such one, by his
lively hope of a joyful Resurrection, such as would make a plentiful amends for
all, ver. 26, 27, 28. For though Mercer make question of it, yet I am out of
doubt, says Beza, that this is the true meaning of this place. And surely the
whole Scripture does not yield us a more notable, or a more clear and manifest
testimony, to confirm unto us the Resurrection of our bodies, then this. This
confession of his faith, says Lavater, is the chief thing in this Chapter, and
therefore challenges our best attention.

Verse 2. How long will ye vex my soul?] viz. with your furious and reproachful
charges and criminations? Have I not misery enough already, but you must lay
more load of scorn and contempt upon me; and so go on to trouble me, by adding
to my saddest sorrows, Hoccine est moestum consolari?
such as pierce to the very soul? Call you this comforting an afflicted friend?

How long will ye break me in pieces with words?] Words also have their weight,
and if hard and harsh, Leniter volant, non leniter violant. Like maules they
break the heart in pieces, like a rack they torment it, Psalm. 42.10. As with a
Murdering weapon in my bones, mine enemies reproached me. You shall find some
(says Erasmus) that of death be threatened can despise it; but to be belyed,
reproached, slandered, they cannot brook, nor from revenge contain themselves.
Job was a strong man both in faith and patience, yet put hard to it by the hard
words given him by Bildad and the rest, who did rather hurt his ear by the
loudness of their voices, then helped his heart, by the force of their
reproofs. Gods servants must not strive, but be gentle, 2 Timothy 2.23, 24.
showing all meekness to all men, Tit. 3.2 Jam. 3.17. Gentle showers comfort
the earth, when dashing storms drown the seed. There is a two fold
inconvenience follows upon bitter and boisterous proceedings with a supposed
offendour. First, the party looks not so much to his own failing as to their
passion, Secondly, As he is unconvinced, so they are not esteemed: but though
they have the right on their side, yet they lose the due regard of their cause,
and reverence of their persons.

Verse 3. These ten times have ye reproached me] i.e. oftentimes. Herein Job
endured a great fight of affliction, as the Apostle styles it, Heb. 10.32, 33.
a manifold fight, (as the word there signifies.) Cate was two and thirty times
accused publicly, and as often cleared and absolved. Basil was counted and
called an Heretic, even by those who, as it appeared afterward, were of the
same judgment with him, and whom he honored as brethren. Dogs in a chase bark
sometimes at their best friends, etc.

You are not ashamed that you make your selves strange to me.] Or, Are you not
ashamed that ye harden your selves against me? Or, That ye ^ter and jest at my
misery? Significat etiam emere, vel componari.
Or, That ye make Merchandise of me, and take your penny worths out of me?
Beze(agreeable to our Translation) paraphraseth it thus, Ye take me up so
short, as if ye dealt with a stranger and forrainer, and not with a friend. And
so the word is taken, Genesis 42.7.

Verse. 4. And be it indeed that I have erred] Of humane frailty; for that
there is any way of wickedness in me (as you would have it) I shall never
yield. But nimis angustares est, nuspiam errare. Involuntary failings I am not
free from: who knows the errors of his life? Psalm. 19.12. What man is he that
lives and sins not? It is the sad privilege of mortality, Euphorm.
says one, Licere aliquando peccare, to have license sometimes to sin.

Mine error remains with my self.] q d. It Is little that you have done toward
the convincing me of any error in all this time, and talk, which until ye have
done, I must still remain of the same mind. Or thus, You shall neither answer
nor suffer for mine error: what need then all this hear and harshnesse? Not
that every man must be left to himself, and let alone to live as he lifts.
Admonition is a Christian duty, and the word of exhortation, must be suffered,
sharp though it be, and to the flesh irksome: better it is that the Vine should
bleed then dye. Had Job been guilty, he would or should have been as Vespasian
is reported, Pati^utissimus very, patient of a reproof. But his friends falsely
accused him for an hypocrite, and fell foul upon another man's servant, whom
they had nothing to do to condemn, Romans 14. And hence this expression of his
discontent.

Verse 5. If indeed yen will wagnifie your selves against me] Or, will you
indeed magnify your selves against me? scil. because of mine error, as verse 4.
which yet ye have not convinced me of? Will ye insult over me therefore, and
throw dirt upon me? Of Bonassus, a certain beast as big as an On, Aristotle
reports, Hist. Animal. lib. 9 cap. 45.
that having horns bending inward and unfit for fight, after that he is
wounded by the hunters, he flies for his life, and often lets fly his dung
for four yards or more, upon the dogs or men that pursue him, to their great
annoyance. In like fort deal many disputers of this world; when they cannot
make good their matter by strength of Argument, they cast upon their
adversaries the dung of calumnies, so seeking to magnify themselves against
him, and pleading against him his reproach.

And plead against me my reproach] Affliction exposes a man to reproach. Where
the hedge is low, the beast will be breaking over. See Zeph. 3.12. with the
Note there.

Verse 6. Know, that God has overthrown me.] Do not you therefore add
affliction to the afflicted, which is so odious a thing to God, Psalm. 41.2.
Diodaze.
and 69.26. but regard the greatness of mine evils, which draw these
complaints from me that seem so immoderate to you. See Job 6.2.

And has compassed me with his net.] Has encompassed me round with
affliction, that I can get out no way. An hunting term, Job 10.16. La^^ 1.23,
Ezekiel. 12.13. Hos. 7.12. Bildad had made much mention of nets and grins, chap.
18.8, 9.
where in God ensnareth and ensnarleth the wicked. Job grants, that Gods not
had encompassed him; but withal denies himself to be wicked, or that his
friends should therefore reproach him, but rather pity him.

Verse 7. Behold I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard] Nothing is more
natural and usual then for men in misery to cry out for help. Jobs great grief
was, that neither God nor man would regard his moanes or deliver him out of the
Net. God did not rescue him, men did not right him or relieve him. His outcry
seems to be the same in effect with that of Habakkuk the Prophet, chap. 1.2,
3. O Lord, how long shall I cry and then wilt not hear? even cry out unto thee
of violence, and thou will not save? Why do thou show not iniquity, and cause
we to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me, and there are
that raise up strife and contention. Wherefore look thou upon them that deal
treacherously, etc. verse 13. Thus Job, but with out an answer: as the Lion
lets his Whelps four themselves hourse for hunger, yea, till they are almost
dead, ere he supplieth them. Sure it is, that God always hears his Jobs,
though he does not always answer in our time, and in our way. Yea it is an
hearing and an answer of prayer (says one) that we can pray, though unheard
and unanswered.

I cry aloud] Heb. I set up my Note; cum gemitu and ululatu, with groaning and
howling Men never pray so earnestly, as in greatest afflictions, Heb. 5.7. Hos.
12.4 then their prayers, like strong streams in narrow streights, bear down all
that stands before them.

Verse 8. He has fenced up my way, etc.] Here Job carried away, as it were,
with a torrent of grief, amp^sieth his miseries by many other comparisons. And
first of a Traveller, whom nothing so much troubles in his journey as hedges
and darkness. God, says Job. has every way hedged me out of content and
comfort, so that though I seek it never so, I cannot find it. Gods people are
often brought into greatest straits, as David, Psalm. 31. and 142. Israel at the
red sea, Jehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles. 20. that they may learn to depend upon the
divine providence, etc.

And he has set darkness in my paths] I am benighted, and know nor wither to
go, or how to get out. Darkness is full of error and terror. A child of light
may walk in darkness, Isai. 50.10. Yea, in the valley of the shadow of death,
Psalm. 23.4. yet is he never without some spark of faith, which guides him in
the deepest darkness, until he behold the Sun of righteousness, Light is
sown for the righteous, etc. heaviness may endure for a night, but joy comes
in the morning, Psalm. 30. ver. 6 And as before the day breaks, the darkness is
greatest: so here.

Verse 9. Genesis 37.23
He has stripped me of my glory] This is the second comparison, ab externo
corporis cultu and habitu, says Merlin. From the outward habiliments and
habits of the body. Our King Richard the 2d, when he was to be deposed, was
brought forth gorgeously attired in his Robes royal, with a crown upon his
head, a Scepter in his hand, etc but soon after despoiled of all, and unkinged,
So it fared with poor Job, stripped and bereft of all that he formerly gloried
in, and was respected for, as a man robbed has all his clothes taken off, and
is lest naked. In him it appeated that mortality was but the stage of
mutability, as one says of our H^^y 6. who of a most potent Monarch, Daniels
Hist.
was, when deposed, not the Master of a Molehil, nor owner of his own liberty.

And has taken the Crown from off my head] Hence some infer, that Job was a
King, the same with Jobab, King of Edom, mentioned Gen, 36.34. But this is
uncertain, since Crown is often in Scripture taken allegorically, for Riches,
Authority, Dignity, and other Ornaments. These were taken from Job, yea, from
off his head, See Lam. 5.16. But he had a better Crown, quae nec eripi, nec
surripi potuit, which could not be taken away; viz. that crown of twelve Stars,
or celestial graces, Rev. 12.1. together with that Crown of glory (the fruit of
the former) that is incorruptible and fades not away, 1 Pet, 1.4. Happy Job in
such a Crown; and that he was in the number of those few heads destined to such
a Diadem. David had (whatever Job had) a Crown of pure gold set upon his head,
Psalm. 21. this was a great mercy to so mean a man, since beyond a Crown the
wishes of mortal men extend not. But David blesses God for a better Crown,
Psalm. 103.4. Who crowns thee with loving kindness and tender mercies. And
how was this set on his head? Who for gives all thy iniquities, etc. verse 3.
Neither can any take away this Crown, because We are kept (Gr. (...)
guarded or garrisoned as in a Tower of brass, or Town of War, that is well
fenced with walls and works and so its made impregnable) by the power of God
through faith unto salvation, 1 Pet. 1.4.

Verse 10 He has destroyed me on every side] Heb. He has demolished, me, he
has pulled me down piecemeal, as an old house is taken down part by part. See
Levit. 14.45. Judge. 8.17. God had made and fashioned Jobs body together round
about, chap. 10.8. and now he destroys it round about. The body of a man is a
wonderful fabric, wherein the bones are the timber-work, the head the
upper-lodging, the eyes as windows, the eyelids as casements, the brows as
pent-houses, the ears as watch-towers, the mouth as a door to take in that
which shall uphold the building, and keep it in reparation; the stomach as a
Kitchen to dress that which is conveyed into it, the guts and baser parts as
sinks belonging to the house, etc. All these were decaying apace in Job. to his
thinking.

And I am gone] That is, I am as good as gone already; every day I yield
somewhat unto death, I am free among the dead, free of that Company.

And my hope has he removed like a tree] He has not left me so much as hope
(which is the last comfort of the afflicted) of ever recovering here my health,
wealth, and former enjoyments: but has lest me as a tree, that is plucked up
by the roots, and so can never grow again, A Saint may be at that pass here in
regard of his outward estate, that there may be to him neither hope of better,
nor place of worse, This was Cranmers Case. Melch. Adam.


Verse 11. He has also kindled his wrath against me.] Now if his wrath be
kindled, yea but a little, woe be to all those against whom it is bent. He will
surely help mischiefs upon them, he will spend his arrows upon them, Deuteronomy.
32.22, 23. with Psalm. 2.12. Job felt them striking in the sides of his soul,
even the invenomed arrows of the Almighty; and yet this was only a Refiners
fire, Mal. 3.2. or, if a consuming fire, as Heb. 12.29. yet it was to waste his
corruptions only, to sever the sin which he hated from the Son whom he loved;
to try and exercise his patience, etc. all which notwithstanding, he
complains heavily of these spunks and sparks of divine displeasure.

And counts me unto him as one of his enemies.] Heb. As his enemies: not as a
single enemy, but a rabble of rebels, an Army of enemies, such as shall one day
meet at Armageddon, their Rendevouz. See chap. 13.24.

Verse 12. His troops come together] i. e. Troops of tribulations and
temptations, of Pirates and Robbers, (as the Seventy have it) sickness and
other sorrows are Gods Soldiers, Matt. 8.8, 9. and they seldom come single,
James 1.2. (...) Sept.
but trooping and treading on the heels of one another, Concatenat a piorum
crux, a company comes.

And raise up their way against me.] As Soldiers besieging a place cast up
their Trenches and Fortifications. Vatablus renders it, And have beaten their
way upon me; that is, says he, tribulations have so often passed over me, that
they have made a path way upon me, more trausenntium, as passengers use to do.

And encamp round about my tabernacle,] Afflictions hem me in on every side,
the troops of troubles besiege me so straightly, that I can no way in all the
world find relief or comfort; which now as by a strong hand, yea, as by a
strong host, are with-holen from my soul, and so are like to be for a long
season, as Sieges are many times. Heman was afflicted and ready to dye from
their youth up, suffering those terrors, Psalm. 88.15. Job was a man of sorrows.

Verse 13. He has put my brethren far from me] In their affections at least:
some stuck to him but for a mischief, for they proved miserable Comforters: as
did likewise Peter to our Savior, who fled not with the rest of the Disciples,
but better he had, for any good he did him, A brother is born for adversity,
says Solomon Proverb. 17.17 and although at other times there may be some
unkindnesse, fratum concordia rara est, yet in affliction and extremity good
nature will work, and good blood will not belie it self: But Jobs brethren
proved unkind, and grew out of kind, they got farthest from him, when his
enemies had besieged him. And all this befell him, not without the Lord: He has
put my brethren far from us; this was no small aggravation of the affliction,
that God withdrew or withheld that assistance and influence that should have
enlarged and united the hearts of his brethren unto him. See Psalm. 105.25.

And mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me] Those that formerly knew
me thoroughly, and were as well known of me, mine intimate friends, Noti mei.
Vulg. Necessarii met. Tigur. Quasi esset scriptum aczaru.
who knew all my heart, are now truly as strange to me, as if there had never
been any such matter of Acquaintance. R. Solomon reads it, They are cruel to
me. All the brethren of the poor man hate him (says Solomon, Prove. 19.7) how
much mere do his friends go far from him? He pursues them with words: yet they
are wanting to him. This the Heathen, (as Ovid and others) heavily complain of.
In the River Araris there is reported to be a fish called Scolopidus, which at
the waxing of the Moon is as white as the driven snow, and at the wayning
thereof, is as black as a burnt coal. (...) Thuc. Et cum fortuna statque
caditqus fides. Ovid. Tempora si fuerint nubula, solus cris. Ibid.
A fit emblem of a false friend. Wealth makes many friends, but the poor is
separeted from his neighour, Prove. 19.4. who therefore turns from him as a
stranger, if not against him as an enemy.

Verse 14 My kinsfolk have failed] scil. in courtesy, as Ruths Kinsman did,
Job had many kinsfolk, but few friends, and this was a great grief to him, as
it was afterward also to David, Psalm. 31.11. and 38.11. and 69.8. to Heman,
Psalm. 88.8. and to Paul. 2 Timothy 4.14.

And my familiar friends] They whom I favored, says Broughton, according to
Psalm. 11.6.

Have forgotten me] Out of sight, out of mind. A thing forgotten is as if it
had never been. All Jobs courtesies were cast away upon these Summon birds, who
had well nigh forgotten that there was ever such a man in the world as Job.

Ver. 15 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, etc.] My Tenants, or my
Guests, or my Sojourners, those widows and Orphans happily, whom he kept at his
own charge chap. 31. More then this, my Maidens, these house keepere, entrushed
with the keys of the family, and that are no drudges to wash the feet of other
servants, as 1. Sam. 25.41. And for his servants of the other sex, he was as
coursely used by them too.

Verse 16. I called my servant, and he gave me no answer.] Though I lay noder
greatest sores and sorrows, and called them to help me, yet such was their
impudency and inhumanity, that they would not vouchsafe an answer, Considera
hic quanta crux sit, says Brentius, a sua propria familia a^spici and rideri;
Consider with me here, what an affliction it is, for a man to be despised and
derided by his own family. A servants eye should look to the hands of his
Master, and the eye of a maiden to the hand of her Mistress, to observe the
motion thereof, and to pick out the meaning, Psalm. 12.2. Accounting their
Governors worthy of all honor, 1 Timothy 6.1. as the Centurions obsequious
servants did, Matthew. 8.9. Sed sic fere sunt server rum ingenia, says Merlin
here: But such is the condition of many servants now a days, that they will do
no more then needs must, Jobs would neither say nor do.

I entreated him with any mouth.] As a suppliant to my servant, who lived upon
me, but would do nothing for me, though I humbly besought him. Here we may so,
says Vatablus that when God is angry with a man, all goes cross with him: It
is good for us in this case, to reflect and see whether we have not served God
in this sort. Alphonsus that renowned King, in a speech to the Popes
Ambassador, professed that he did not so much wonder at his servants
unthankfulness and undutifulness to him, as at his own to God.

Verse 17. My breath is strange to my wife] The corruption of his inwands
(besides the ^^fommesse of his out ward Ulcers) made his breath strong and
unwholsom. This his wife (as did that Roman Lady, who said she thought all men's
breath as unsavory as her husbands was) should have born with in a time of
sickness especially; when she should have shew^^ her self an help, and not an
heart-break to her hus^and Famous in our Chronicles is the Lady Eloner, wife to
Prince Edward (afterward Edward the First) who extracted the poison out of her
husbands wounds with her tongue, Cambd. in Middlesex, Speed 630.
^^cking daily (whilst he slept) his ra^^kling wounds, wheneby they perfectly
closed. And no less famous is the wife of Valdaumus, celebrated by Ludon.
Vi^es Lib. 2 de Christiana femina, p. 360. A young and beautiful Maid (says
he) was marched to a man stricken in years, whom after she found to have a very
fulsome breath, and a diseased body, yet (out of conscience, being by Gods
providence become his wife) she most worthily digested, with incredible
patience and contentment, the languishing and loathsomeness of an husband,
continually visited with variety of most i^^some and infectious diseases: and
though friends and Physicians advised her by no means to come near his, for
fear of danger and infection, yet she passing by with a loving disdain and
contempt these unkind disswasions, plied him night and day with extraordinary
tenderness and care, and services of all sorts above her strength and ability:
she was to him friends, Physician, Wife, Nurse; yea she was Father, Mother,
Brother, Sister, Daughter, every thing, and thing, to do him good any manner of
way, etc.

Though I entreated for the Childrens sake, etc.] i.e. By the holy right of
wedlock, and the fruit thereof, those dear pledges of our matrimonial good
affection: Children, as they are dear to their Parents, Jun.
( Charos, Plautus somewhere calls them) so they are an endearing to their
parents, whose seed they are called, as if there were nothing left to the
parents but the h^^ks. This therefore was a melting argument, but it (...) not
Job's wife. Men may speak perswasively, but God only persuades.

Verse 18. Yea, young children despised me.] Fools, says the vulgar, who are
never more pleasant than when they play the Buffoons at my expense. Ungodly men
some render it, (...) 16.11. Others, the baser sort of people. And surely none
so base as they that deride virtue, especially because forsaken of fortune, as
one phraseth it. What a l^tter je^r was that of To bi^^ the servant, (or,
stave) the Ammonite, Neh. 4.3? The basest can mock, as the Abjects did David,
Psalm. 45.15. and the Alestake^ also, Psalm. 69.13. But it is an happi^^^ to do
well, and yet hear ill. All Gods people must ^^ready to pass through good
repo^^, and evil report, 2 Cor. 6.2. And every Job must ^^ck^^, that as the
reproacher in (...), not so much as a man (says chrysostom;] So the
reproached that bears it well, is Angelis par, equal to the Angels.

I arose, and they spoke against me.] I arose, sc. to rebuke them, or to
pacify them, or to pass away from them, and my back is no Tooner turned, but
they reviled me. Some render it, Sto coram illis, I stand before them; that is,
they stay not till I am gone past, but reproached me to my face, such is their
boldness and baseness: see Esa. 3.5.

Verse 19. All my in ward friends abhorred me.] Heb. All the Mortals of my
Counsel. q.d. My most intimate acquaintance and associates, my highest
confidents to whom I was wont to open my bosom, and with whom I maintained
closest correspondency: Lo, these now abhor me, and keep a loof off from me;
yea, they appostatize from their professed friendship; and renouncing the laws
of love, they deal despightfully with me, and are turned against me. Such an
one was Abitophel to David, Psalm. 55.14, 15. Judas to Christ, Matthew. 26, 23,
and Bildad to Job (as some conceive that he conceited by the latter clause of
this verse) And they whom I loved etc.] Heb. and this man whom I loved, this
bitter Bildad, that in his last speech has so greivously galled me, who have
hitherto so highly prized him. What? thou my son Bildad? This went to the very
heart of him, (...)
as afterward it did of David, when for his love they were his adversaries,
when they rewarded him evil for good, and hatred for his good will, Psalm.
109.4, 5. Precious therefore and worthy of all acceptance is that advice of
the Prophet Micah, chap. 7.5.6, 7. Trust not in a friend put not confidence in
a guide keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lies in thy bosom. For the
son dishonors the father, -- A man's enemies are the men of his own house.
Look therefore unto the Lord, (...)
etc. all that trust in him, shall triumph: but for others, we may be compeld to
complain with Q. Elizabeth, In Trust, I have found Treason, etc.

Verse 20. My bone cleaves to my skin.] My skin is a bag of bones. I am become
a mere Skeleton. and may well cry out, O my leanness, my leanness! Isaiah 24.16
So bare I am grown, that little appears in me but skin and bones. My bones
cleaves to my skin at to my flesh. (so it may be read) that is, as once it did
in my flesh, Ossa sub incurim apparent areda lumbis.
when I was well lined within. Now, alas, I lie under a miserable Marasmus; and
should therefore be pitied, as being a just object of your commiseration.

And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.] Escaped I am, and come off (as
out of an hot skirmish) with my life, and very little else. All I have lest me
whole is the skin of my teeth; that is, of my gums, into which my teeth are
engraffed: the rest of my body is all over of a scab. The vulgar renders it,
My lips only about my teeth are lest me untoucht. And Junius gives this gloss,
Job had nothing lest him but the instrument of speech. These, say some, the
Devil purposely meddled not with, as hoping that therewith he would curse God.
Cruse him he might with his heart only; but this would have pleased the Devil
nothing so well as to hear him do it with his tongue. this is the conceit of
some of the Jew-Doctors. Hoc fecisse Satanam volunt, ut voluntatem captret.
Merc.
But it is better to ascribe this escape to the good providence of God, than to
the mailce of the Devil.

Verse 21. Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, etc.] To him that is afflicted
pity should he showed from his friend: and to do otherwise, is to forsake the
fear of the Almighty chap. 6.14. See the Note there. There was little, either
fear of God, or mercy to men, in that barbarous Bishop of Spire, who denied to
Hen. 4. Emperor of Germany, (deposed after ten years reign, and hardly
bestead) a poor Clerkship there in a Monastery of his own foundation; which
caused the miserable Emperor to break out into these words of Job, Have pity
upon me, have pity upon me o my friend: for the hand of God has touched me.
The Papists tell us, That the souls in Purgatory cry out to their friends on
earth for help on this manner, and in these terms. But this is as very a
Fiction, as purgatory it self is the Popes invention: who must needs be extreme
pitilesse, to suffer so many souls to lie m so great torments, when as he has
power to fetch them out at his pleasure,

Verse 23, Why do ye persecute ^e as God?] Is this that pitying of me, thus to
press me with reproaches, and therein to think you gratify God, and do him
good service? Know ye not, that to persecute him, whom he has smitten, is
greatest cruelty? and to talk to the grief of those whom he has wounded, is to
heap up guilt. and thereby wrath, Psalm, 69.26, 27. When a Dear is shot, the
rest of the Herd push him out of the company. When a tree falls, every
passenger is ready to be pulling at it. But Gods people should love as
Brethren, be pitiful be courteous, (...)
1 Pet 3.8. and of some have compassion, making a difference, and others save
with fear, pulling them out of the fire. Jude 22, 23. Thus it should be: but as
of old, in Egypt, one Hebrew smote another; blows enough were not dea^ by the
common adversary, but their own must add to the violence: Still Satan is thus
busy, and Christians are thus malicious; that, as if they wanted Persecutours,
they persecute one another; and if (as here) they can but do as God, that is,
for God, as they misperswade themselves (to vindicate his Justice, and to
promote his glory) then they rage and are confident. as these friends of Job;
in whom nevertheless it was rather error amoris, then amor erroris, an error
of love, then any love of error.

And art not satisfied with my flesh] Which is pined a way with pain and
grief: This contents you not, Est detractoris periphrasis. Mercer. Non minue
enim calumniatores homines devorant quam Scytha. Brent. in loc.
but you must break my bones also, and suck my blood by your contumelies and
calumnies. Br^ntius and others apply this Tert to slanderers, and back-biters,
whom they compare to Cannibals. It is reported of Wolves, that when they have
once fed upon man's flesh, they desist not, but desire mort of it. Job looks
upon his friends as such man-eaters, wherein his sorrow transported him too
far; and whiles he was moving them to compassion, he shows himself over
passionate.

Verse 23. Oh that my words were now written] This reiterated wish Job sets
as a Preamble to that ensuing memorable testimony of the Resurrection, as a
matter most weighty and worthy the consideration of all ages, which therefore
he wishes recorded in some public Instrument no alseternity: And god said,
Amen, to it. For not only this precious passage, but the whole Book of Job. so
full of divine instruction preparatory to the lost day was committed to waiting
(either by Meses, or some other Prophets of that age, or else by Job himself
after his restoration) and put among the Canonical Books of Scripture;
concerning which David says, For ever, O Lord; thy Word is settled in heavean,
Psalm. 219, 89. And Christ, Heaven and earth shall pass away, but not one jot
or tittle, etc. Matthew. 5. Not one hair of that sacred head can fall to the
earth. Aug. Confess. l. 5. c. 8.
Thus God has answered Job, ad cardin^^^ desiderii, as a Father speaks,
leating it be to him, even as he would.

Oh that they were printed] Or drawn out, that is, written (says One) in great
and Capital Letters, that every man might read them, Hab. 22. for there was no
Printing in those days that we know of. The Chino^s indeed tell us, that they
had the Art of Printing long before. But in Europe it was not heard of till the
year, One thousand four hundred and forty. It begun to be practiced at Harlem
in the Low. Countries (by Lawrence Jans, say some, by John Gertude^^erg say
others) and was perfected at Meniz. where Tulliet Offices, the first Book that
ever was printed, is still kept for a Monument.

In a Book] that it might be preserved and laid up for the use of posterity, in
some Kiriah-sepher, or City of Books. Let them that are able, be apt and active
in setting forth Books for the benefit of others, Horat.
since. Paulum sepultae did at inertiae Celata virtu. -- He that buried his
talent gave an heavy account to the Master, and was therefore called evil,
because idle servant. Matthew. 25.

Verse 24. That they were graven with an iron pen, etc.] That my words were not
only Soriptased sculota, written, but graven in a Rock as the Laws of diverse
Nations were cut in Brass or Marble; and as Monuments and Epitaphs are graven
on Tombs for remembrance of those that are dead.

And Lead] Plumbo per sulces infuso, says Junius, the curs of the Letters in
Marble being filled with Lead, that they might be the more legible and durable.

In the Rock] In Marble cut out of the Rock. Golden words they are indeed that
here follow, Clarks Lives.
and well worthy to be written in Lotten of God. In the Life of Ziscn (that
Warlike Babe^^ian,) it is recorded, that in the famous Monastery called, the
Kings Court, a mile from Pragus, in the walls there of the whole Bible was most
exquisitely engraven in Lette^s of Gold.

For ever] To last longer then the would lasts. Those bloody Tyrants of the
Primitive times made account they had made sure work in rooting out true
Religion, when they sounded the triumph before hand, and engraved the victory
upon Pillars of Marble in these bubbles of words; Nomine Christianorum delo^o
qui R^^s. ov^rebant, etc But Christ shall reign, and the Church shall stand
upon his right hand as a Queen in gold of Ophir, Psalm. 45 9 When all earthly
greatness shall lie in the dust, Thy throne O God, is for ever and ever. Psalm.
45.6. and there shall be a new succession of Saints to all perpetuity, Psalm.
72, 17. His name shall endure for ever: His name shall be continued (Heb.
childed) as long as the Son, as long as the world, as long as the Word of our,
God, which according to Jobs wish here, shall stand for ever, Isai, 40.8. But
what means the Vulgar translation here by this insignificant word Celte? And
why should Hugo feek to salve the matter, Celte vox est nihili. Merc.
by reiling us, that Celtes is a Tool wherewith Letters or Pictures are cut in
the flint Whereupon Vide quaeso, mi Lector, says Brentius, See, I pray thee,
good Reader, how only they interpres Scripture that want Learning; for neither
is Celte such a Tool, nor can it be Celte for centa, since the Hebrew word
L^guad does not signify Surely. but For ever.

Verse 25. For I know that my Redeemer lives.] Clarissima fidei confessio,
says Brentius, A most famous Confession of his faith. Breves and long,
^^taque aurea, est hac Apologia, says Another, This is Jobs short and yet long
Apology, bat golden all oven, and such as has fullness of matter in fewness of
words. Calvin and Mercar (viri alioqui judioiosissimi) are mistaken here, when,
following the Ra^hins, they interpret this text of a temporal restoration of
Job to such an estate of honor and riches, as he had enjoyed in the former
part of his life: this they call Jobs Resurrection and Redemption, etc. But his
thoughes soared higher then so, I know, faith he; it is as if he should say,
you take your selves to he the only knowing men, and as for me, Bilded has set
me among such as know not God, Chop. 18.21. But hereby I know that I know him,
1 John 2.3. Because I know him whom he has sent Jesus Christ, John 17.3. Net
only as a Redeemer, but as my Rodeemer by a particular application of him to my
self, which is the very pith and form of faith. This great Mystery of
godliness I know, what ever else I am ignorant of; and I know it savingly,
because I am secure of my interest in Christ, my Kinsman and Redeemer; and
therefore I am no hypocrite or wicked man, as you would make me. Were it not
for this word of possession, (Mine) the worst man alive ^ay the devil, might
say at Job here does; yea, repeat all the Articles of the Creed, to as good
purpose as he but that which tormenteth the devil is, he can say, My, to never
a one of them, I know says Job, when condemned for an hypocrite, that Christ
is my Redeemes, and that this my Redeemer lives for over, and is for ever
mine. So Doctor Tailor Martyr, when condemned for an Heretic, subsribed his
last Will and Testament, Acts and Mon.
in these words, Row hand Tailor, departing hence in a sare hope, without all
(...) of a glorious Resurrection, I thank God my heavenly Father, through Jesus
Christ my certains Savior.

And that he shall stand] As keeping the field when all his foes shall be his
footstool, Psalm. 1 10.1. So he stands, Rev. 10.2. setting his right foot upon
the sea, and his left foot upon the earth, (maugre all Heretics and
Antichrists that therehence arise) as Lord Paramount of both.

At the latter day] Or last of all. Theodesius renders it, Novissime, a
general judgment of quick and dead at the last day; was in Jobs time, and after
wards by Zoroaster, and other Heathens (as Lucretius, Theopompus, Plato,
Cicero, Ovid, etc) believed and foretold. But in process of time, this true
and pure Doctrine was darkened amongst them, and when once it was extinct;
Superstitions, and other vain fopperies over grew the greatest part of the
world. The ancient tradition was, that the latter age of the world should be so
filthy all over, that as it could not be washed with water, as once, so it
should he wasted with fire, 2 Pet. 3.10.

Upon the earth] Or, Over the earth; to wit, in the air. For there it is
probable Christ will sit in the clouds of the air near unto the earth, whether
the Elect shall be caught up to meet the Lord, and so shall they ever be with the
Lord, 1 The. 4.17. There the devils shall be subdued and sentenced, where they
have ruled and played Rex, Ephesians. 2.2, see Mat. 24.30. some read it, And this
(pointing to his body) shall stand, up at the last day upon the earth.

Verse 26. And thought after my skin, worms destroy this body.] Here he
points again, as does likewise David. when Psalm. 34.6. he says, This poor
man cried, and the Lord heard him etc. So the ancient Believers, when they came
to that Article in the Creed, I believe the Resurrection of the flesh, were
wont to add, Etiam bujus carnis, even of this flesh, pointing to some naked
part of their body; or else alluding to that of the Apostle, This mortal must
put on, etc.

Worms destroy this body] Heb. They destroy this; he says not this body, quod
oh deformitatem summam, non licerit corpus dicere, faith Vatablus, So worn it
was, and wasted with sores and sicknesses, that it could scarce be called a
body. And yet it was not at the worst neither, for in the grave it should be
worm-eaten, and something more. Sermon. 48. ad frat. in erem.
Mihi exper to credit, says Austin, Believe me who have tried it, open dead
men's Sepulchers, and upon their heads ye shall find toads crawling, begotten of
their brains, on their loins serpents, begotten of their Rains, in their
bellies worms begotten of their bowels, etc.

Yet in my flesh.] Hebr. Out of my flesh, as out of a casement.

I shall see God] I shall see Christ, Christum in corpore, ( Austins wish) the
humane and glorified body of Christ, who is god blessed for ever, as also the
mystical body of his Church perfectly united unto him 1 John 3.2. To this sense
some render the Text thus, I shall see God in my flesh, that is, I shall see
Christ sitting in glory, clothed with flesh, or in the likeness of man. And
here do but think with thy self, (though it far pass the reach of any mortal
thought, faith One) what an infinite inexplicable happiness it will be, to
look for ever upon the glorious body of Jesus Christ, shining with
incomprehensible beauty, and to consider that even every vein of that blessed
body bled to bring thee to heaven: And that it being with such excess of glory
hypostatically united to the second Person in Trinity, has honored and
advanced thy Nature, in that respect far above the brightest Cherub. The whole
verse may be read thus, And after I shall awake, though this body shall be
destroyed, yet out of my flesh shall I see God. And being thus read, it is a
plainer and fuller confession of the Resurrection, says an Interpreter. It is
common is Scripture to compare death to sleep and Resurrection to awaking, Dan.
12.2. Psalm. 17.15. The bodies of the Saints are laid in the grave, as in a bed
of Roses, to ripen and mellow against the Resurrection, and they write upon
their graves, as One did once, Resurgam, I shall surely rise again. Moses his
body hid in the valley of Moab, appeared afterwaths glorious in Mount Tabor. D.
King.
This is matter of joy and triumph, as it was here to Job and to those good
souls who were to lose all, Dan, 12.2. and those Heb. 11.35. considering that
God by rotting would refine their bodies, and in due time raise them
conformabley to Christ's most glorious body, the standard. The forethought of
this cheared up David's good heart, Psalm 16 9. and those in Isaiah, chap.
26.19. and the good people in our Saviors time, Beauchama.
John 11.24. I know (says Martha, concerning her brother Lazarus) that be
shall rise again at the Resurrection, at the Consolation; says the Syriack
Interpreter. Resurrection and Consolation then were terms equivalent. Hence
that great Apostle, 2 Cor. 4.17. For this cause we faint not, says he; For
what cause? Because we believe, that be which raised up the Lord Jesus, shall
raise us up also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. And the same Apostle
makes this Doctrine of the Resurrection, the Canon of Consolation, 1 These.
4.13, 14. etc. to the end.

Verse 27. Whom I shall see for my self.] He speaks confidently, as one full
assured of a Resurrection; which if it should not be, how should there be a
remuneration of the body? Say not, We cannot see how it is possible. See we not a
yearly Resurrection of grass, grain, herbs, flowers, fruits every Spring tide?
Know we not that men can of ashes make glasses? that a Chemist can of several
metals mixed to get her, Lav^. in Job 14.12.
extract the one from the other, and reduce every metal to its own species or
king? Etiam animalula quaedam typi Resurrectiones sunt, says Lavater. Some
little living creatures are Types of the Resurrection. He instanceth in
Dormise, which sleep all wintes, and revive in the spring; in Silk worms,
which dying, leave nothing behind them but a certain excrement, which being
born about in the bosoms of women, takes heat and reviveth. Wherefore if
Nature do such things, shall it be held havd for the God of Nature to raise the
dead? The keeping green of Noah Olive tree in the time of the flood, the
blossoming of Aarons dry Rod, the flesh and sinews coming to Ezekiels dry
bones, what were these, but lively emblemes of the Resurrection?

And mine eyes shall behold, and not another.] Here he maintains the
identity of his flesh and body in the Resurrection; an identity, I say, not
specifical only, but numerical or individual. The self sa^^ particular body
which fell, shall rise. Tert de Resurrect. lib. 2.
This was denied of old by the Marcionists, Basilidians and Valentinians (those
Simi-Sadduces, as Tertullian terms them;) and after them Entuchius Bishop of
Constantinople, who (as Gregory says) taught, that men rising again, should
have ayery bodies, and not fleshly, yea more subtle then the Air, abusing
that place of the Apostle, It is ^^wen a natural body, it is raised again a
spiritual body, etc. but his book was burnt as Heretical. A spiritual body it
is called, for its great strength and activity wherewith it shall be endowed,
and where by it is enabled to bear a weight of glory; as also, for that it
shall have no need of food, sleep, or other natural helps, but we shall be as
the Angels of God, Matthew. 22 30. yet still the same men that now we are. Let no
man say with Nicodemus, How can this be? There is no difficulty to Omnipotency.
Phil. 3. (...). Besides, there is a substance still preserved, even when the
body is turned to dust, and this shall be raised, (...) and reunited to the
soul. He that made man at first of nothing, can easily remake him of something.
And what though his dust be scattered hither and thither, and mixed with that of
others? The skilful Gardener having sundry sorst of seeds mixed together* can
soon sever them: and shall not he who has the whole earth in his fist discern
the dust of his Saints one from another? Little balls or pickles or
Quicksilver being scattered on the ground mix not themselves with any of
another kind: But if any man gather them, they run together into one of their
own accord; So it is here, greg. Nyssen.
says a Father.

Though my raines be consumed within me] Though from my skin outward to my
raines inward, all be wasted, yet all shall be raised and restored. The Vulgar
renders these words thus, This hope is laid up in my bosom; and is by
Burgensis expoundod thus, This is the only thing that I do most earnestly wish
and wait for, viz. to see Christ in the flesh at the last day, the raynes are
the sent of strong desires.

Verse 28. But ye should say, Why persecute we him?] This ye shall one day
surely say, Then shall ye return and discern betwixt the righteous and the
wicked, etc. Nam ^lim diciti^ cur cum persequebam^r. Tigur.
Mal. 3.18. Then shall it repent you (it should do so now) that ye have rated
and reviled me for an by poerite; viz. when God has cleared mine integrity,
(as he did chap. 42.) or at the last day howsoever, what time there shall be a
Resurtection of names as well as of bodies. Would ye but say so now, it would
be some satisfaction. Que^ panites precasse poene est inn^cons. You have heard
by the confession I have made, I am no miscreant, no misbeliever; but that I do
hold fast the faithful Word.

The root of the mentor is in me.] Or, the root of the Word, the engrafied word
of God that is able to save my soul, has taken deep root in me, J^n. 1.21. I
hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, 1 Timothy 3.9. this, is the
Cabinet, that, the Jewel hept therein. And with what face can ye censure such
an one for a castaway, who am sorely afflicted indeed, so that my very raines
are consumed within me, my graces also happily are somewhat deflourished, and it
is little better with me then with a tree in winter; and as a Tyle tree, whose
say is in the root, Isai. 6.13. But so long as the root of the matter is in me,
that radical grace of faith; and fith I do utter, as ye have heard, the words
of truth and soberness (as some fruits of a sound faith) sure you should
handle me with more tenderness, as one that has some sap and substance in him.

Verse 29 Be ye afraid of the sword.] Heb. Be ye afraid for your selves, form
the fact of the sword; Gods sore, and great, and strong sword, Isai. 27.1. that
hangs over your heads as it were by a twined thread. O tremble at Gods
judgments, whilst they hang in the threat^ings. He that trembles not in
hearing, shall be cut to pieces in feeling, in that Mar^y^ said, Gods sword
(...) the re^^, Ezekiel. 21.13. If Job be under his rod, they that persecute him,
under what pretense soever, shall feel the dint of his Sword, of his deep
displeasure. Now it is a fearful thing to fall into the punishing hands of the
living God. And cruelty toward others, (toward his own especially) he will be
sure to punish, for he is gracious, Exodus 22.27. Fugite ergo a facie gladii,
flee therefore from the face of the sword, (so the vulgar renders this text.)
The sword is an instrument of death; it has its name in Hebrew from laying
waste; and the face or faces of the sword show that divine vengeance is near at
hand. Aug in Ps. 30.
It is a mercy to men that God whets his Sword before he smites, and first
takes hold on judgment, before his judgments take hold on us, Deuteronomy. 32. 41.

For wrath brings the punishment of the sword.] It is from displeased love,
that God chastizeth his children; but from fierce wrath, that he plagueth his
enemies: Some of these God punishes here, lest his providence, but not all
lest his patience and promise of judgment should be called into question.

That we may know that there is judgment.] Wherein they that rashly judge
others shall be judged by God, Math. 7.1. And this Jobs friends knew well
enough, but well weighed not, to fright themselves from rash censurings. He
minds them therefore of their, danger, and labors to prevent their sorrow, who
had so much caused his. See the like in Jeremy chap. 26.15. in our Savior, in
St. Stephen, etc. and learn to be like charitable; though your success be no
better than Jobs was, upon whom, in lieu of this love they fell more foul than
before, as will appear by their following discurses.

CHAP. XX. Verse 1. Then answered Zophat the Naamathite and said.]
IF a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there
is no rest, Prove. 29.9. Christ piped to that crooked generation, Jobs mourned
to them, but all to no purpose; absurd and unreasonable people will never be
satisfied, or set down say what you can to them, such is their pertinacy and
peevishness. Job had utterred himself in such passionate expressions as might
have moved stony hearts. Sed surdo fabulam. Vbi babent sere singulae voces
aliquid ponderis, Merl.
He had set forth his own misery, begged their pity, made an excellent
confession of his Faith, every word where of had its weight, each sylable its
substance: He had lastly terrified them with the threats of Gods Sword: but
nothing would do. Zophar here (though he had little to say more, then what he
had said chap. 11. yet he) takes occasion from Jobs last words, though full of
love, to rough hew him again, and makes as if he were necessitated thereunto
for his own and his fellows necessary defense. Vatablus thinks that Zophar here
makes answer, not to the preceding words, but to those in the 12 Chapter,
where Job had complained, that wicked Oppressors live commonly in greatest
peace and prosperity. Whatever it is, Zophar henceforth will say no more:
either he had said what he could, or was satisfied with Jobs Reply in the next
Chapter: or lastly. quia lusurum se operans credebat, as Mercer observes;
because he thought he should lose his labor, which no wise man would do.

Verse 2. Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer.] q. d. Whereas I had
thought, O Job, to have spoke no more to thee, (for I see I do but lose my
sweet words) thy last, Comminatory expressions have altered my resolution. So
nettled I am, that I must needsly interrupt thee. And yet think not that I
shall speak what soever lies uppermost: for I have dipped and dyed my words in
my thought, which do now prompt me what to answer and bid me make haste.

And for this I make haste.] Lavat.
Lest I should forget the particulars of thy speech, whereto I am to answer.
Munster renders it thus, Et ob is promptitudo mea est intra me, as if Zophar
had boasted of his ready elocution, as in the next verse of his ripe
understanding. Some render it, E^^ this I delight in inspiring.

Verse 3. I have heard the check of my reproach.] Zophar conceived himself
disgraced as well as menaced by Job; and this kindled him: Some are of so testy
a nature, says one, so skittish and unquiet humor, that a little offensive
breath, a disgraceful word, blows them up into rage that will not be laid down,
with out revenge, or reparation of their credits. Jobs reproofs were by this
man construed for reproaches: and what was spoken to them all, he applies to
himself. It appears that he was sick of a Noli me tangere; when being touched
so gently, nettle-like, he stingeth him who handled him.

And the Spirit of my understanding causes me to answer.] This I shall do with
reason and understanding, not with passion and recrimination, Spiritus Dei nec
mendax, nec mordax; meekness of wisdom is a fruit of Gods Spirit; by the which,
and not by his reasonable soul only, Zophar seems to himself to be carried
on. And surely they are holy Truths all along that he utters, but wrested and
misapplyed as to Job, whom he will needs have to be wicked, because wretched;
Interim observemus, says Lavater, meanwhile let us observe, that these
things, sc. the state and portion of the wicked, the greatness and suddenness
of their punishments is therefore by Gods appointment so often propounded and
pressed in this whole Book (whereof this is almost the sole Argument) that we
might be right in that point; fear to offend, and not fret at the wicked man's
prosperity, which is but momentany. The Tigurin^s translate this clause thus,
Tametsi me conscientia hic consolabitur Albeit herein my conscience shall
comfort me.

Verse 4. Know thou not this of old?] Whether Zophar intended his own
Conscience or not, before, he here appears to Jobs; and secretly taxes him
of going against it, or, at least of gross ignorance: Know thou not this,
which every one knows, that is not a mere Novice, and which is proved by the
examples and experience of all ages? To wit, Malis male esse; that it shall be
ill with the wicked: This is a generally received maxim, and the Histories of
all ages do plainly and plentifully confirm it. Hinc collige, diligenter
observanda esse, etc. Merlin.
Hence we may well gather, that Gods Judgments against wicked persons are to
be diligently observed out of the Histories of all ages, both divine, and
humane.

Since man was placed upon the earth] Heb. Since he placed man upon the earth.
viz. in that earthly Paradise the Garden of Eden. planted on purpose for man's
pleasure; where nevertheless he stayed not one night. as some gather from
Psalm. 49.12. Pecorib^ morticinis.
but soon by his sin became like the beasts that perish, that dye of the
murrain says Junius, and so are good for nothing. Cain for like cause was cast
out, the old world drowned, Sodom and her sisters consumed with fire, etc.
There cannot be one instance given to the contrary of that which is here
affirmed, viz.

Verse 5. That the tryumphing of the wicked is short.] Heb. That the shouting
of the wicked is from near. it is of no long standing, but like a blaze of
thorns that is quickly extinct, or as a bubble in the water that is soon down:
The pleasure of sin is but for a season, Hujus sententiae exemplum habes in
Goliath, says Brentius here, An example of this sentence we have in Goliath, 1 Samuel 17. And another in his Countrymen the Philistines, who had twice beaten
the Israelites, and taken the Ark, 1 Samuel 4. but this triumph was soon at an
end: and so was that of the Jews when they had crucified Christ, and now
danced upon his grave, as the Proverb is; but he arose in despite of them, and
set up his Trophies. Say that the triumph of the wicked should last as long as
life, what is that to the infinite? Punctum est quod vivimus, and puncto minus.
But wicked men commonly dye before their time, as Solomon phraseth it, Eccles.
7.17. that is, by an untimely death, they live not half their days, Psalm.
55.25. God cuts them off, that others may live more quietly: and whiles they
live, their comforts are not sincere, but mixed with many molestations: Little
knows the world where their new shoes pinch them, as that roman said. One
little drop of an evil conscience can trouble a whole sea of the wicked man's
tryumphs.

The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment.] Zophar had a strong conceit
that Job was but an hypocrite, one that was wicked before God in heart,
notwithstanding his fair pretenses and prosessions of piety, and should
therefore be led forth with the workers of iniquity, Psalm. 175.5. as cattle led
to the slaughter, or as Bulls led to the Altar, with Garlands on their horns,
and Music by their sides, Act. 14.13. but suddenly they feel and fall under
the murdering Axe. Such is the hypocrites joy, and Zophar would he should know
so much, being sensible of this, that himself was the party in speech; since his
prosperity had ended in misery, and God had dashed all his comforts.

Verse 6. Though his excellency mount up to the heavens.] Though he conceit
himself, and would have others hold him to be more then a man, and to accord
him divine honor. If his pride ascend even up to heaven, so the Vulgar
renders it. If his gifts ascend up to heaven, so the Septuagint, and indeed
hypocrites are ever lifted up with their gifts, as some Corinthians were with
their waxen wings, 1 Cor. 8.1. being enriched in all utterance and knowledge,
and coming behind others in no gift, 1 Cor. 1.7. yet were they babes at best,
and carnal, walking as men, chap. 3 2, 3. their Religion was more in notion
then in motion: They had the spiritual Rickets, grew big in the head, etc. as
the Moon, they increased in light, but not in heat. In which respect also, and
for her external privileges, Capernaum is said to be lifted up to heaven,
Matthew. 11.23. And the Temporary to taste of the heavenly gift, to partake of
the powers of the world to come, Hebr. 6.4, 5.

And his head reach unto the clouds] Aequalis astris gradior, faith He in the
Poet: and Bibulus in Coele est, Sen. in Thiest. Cic. ad Attic.
says the Orator. The Heathen Rhetoric is but dull stuff to that in this
Book; and indeed in this one Chapter. An hypocrites head is often above the
clouds of heaven, when his heart is beneath the clods of the earth: Like the
Eagle, which when he soareth highest of all, even out of sight almost. has his
eye all the while upon his prey below. Or like the Apricock tree, which shoots
up and leanes upon the wall, but is fast rooted in the earth. This whole
Allusion may be unto a tree, like that of Nebuchadnezzar, whose height was
great, and reached unto heaven, Dan. 4.10, 11. with 22. Or that of the Amorite,
whose height was like the height of the Cedars, and he was strong as the Oaks,
Amos 3.9.

Verse 7. Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung.] Then the which
nothing is more filthy an detestable. See this exemplified in Herod, Haman,
Boniface the Eight, bloody Bonner buried in a muck-hil, etc. The word rendered
dung, has its denomination from rolling, because it is rolled out of doors,
and swept out of sight: Many instances hereof might be given in the pristine
and modern Persecutors, punished with ignominious and disgraceful ends. Sisera
and Jabin perished at Endor, and became as dung for the earth, Psalm. 83.10.
Jehorans died undesired. Julian the Apostate abhorred. Isai. 14.23
God has for such, a Beesome of Destruction.

They which have seen him Where is he?] They which have seen him with wonder,
shall now see him with horror, when they see him at such an under, such an
ebb, such a dead low water. See this exemplified in that proud Caldean, Isai.
14.4, 12, 16.

Tam subito casu, quae valuere, ruunt. Verse 8. He shall flee away as a dream,
etc.] As a delightful dream is soon forgotten; so shall it he with the
hypocrite. His felicity is merely imaginary, his joy is but as the commotion of
the affections in a dream, which comes to nothing, Isai. 20.7, 8. A man that is
to be hanged next day, may dream over night he shall be a King. A man that
sleeps upon a steep Rock, may dream of great possessions befalne him, and
starting for joy, may fall to the bottom, and mischieve himself, Psalm. 73.20.
As a dream when one awaketh, so. O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shall despise
their image; that is, their painted pageant of outward pomp. Surely such, of
all men, walk in a vain show, or in an image, Psalm. 39, 6. their seeming
prosperity has no tack consistence in it, themselves and their money perish
together, Act. 8.20.

Yea, he shall be chased away.] By the displeasure of Almighty God, he shall be
driven or rather kicked out of the world.

As a vision of the night.] Phasma five Phantasma, which passes sooner out of
memory, and is more transient then a day vision.

Verse 9. The eye also which saw him, shall see him no more.] He shall be
utterly out of sight, out of mind; Vnkent, unkist, as the Northern Proverb has
it. See chap. 7.8, 10. Where Job speaks as much of himself, and Zopher here
twits him with it: as if Sorex suo periisset indicio, Job were an hypoctite by
his own confession: so ingenious is evil will.

Verse 10. His children shall seek to please the poor.] Tenni^res sunt ipsit
tenuibus, says Junius; shall be poorer then the poorest, and full glad to
comply with them, and humor them, to beg with them, if not to beg of them. A
just hand of God upon Oppressors, whose work it has been to make many poor,
and now their posterity are brought to extreme poverty. Such shame consult
these men to their houses, besides their sin against their own souls, Hob 2.10.
See the Note there. Some read it thus, The poor shall oppress his children;
and how grievous that is, see Prove. 28.3. with the Note. A Heathen Historian
observed, that Dionysius, Val. lib. 1. cap. 2
after his death, paid dear for his Sacrilege, in the disasters that befell
his children.

And his hands shall restore their goods.] Or, For his hands shall, etc. They
should indeed restore their ill-gotten goods, though to the impoverishing of
their posterity, though they left their children no more but a wallet to beg
from door to door. But such are rare birds: most men will rather venture it,
then be drawn, Zacheus-like, to make restitution. God must give them a Vomit,
as verse. 20. or they will lay up nothing: part they will not with those
murdering morsels, that riches of iniquity ( Luke 16.9) they have devoured,
but what they can neither will nor choose, as being compelled to do it either by
Law or force, either by justice or violence. The right owners do not always
receive what was by wrench or wile gotten from them: but these oppressors, or
their imps are many times rooked or robbed by others as bad as themselves (as
the usutious Jews are at this day by the injurious Papists, who use them as
Spunges, which they may squeeze at their pleasure:) God so disposing and
ordering the disorders of men to his own glory.

Verse 11. His bones are full of the sin of his youth] Fowl practices have so
grown up together with some sinful people, that they may say of them as the
Strumpet Quartilla did of her Virginity, that she could not remember that ever
she had been a maid. This has been thy manner from thy youth, that thou
obeyedst not my voice, Junonom meam i^ atam habeam si unquam me meminerim
Virginc^s. Petron.
Jer. 22.21. Then thou had no mind to it, but now thou have less, thy heart
being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, Heb. 3.17. Now in the froth of
these youthful vanities unrepented of, breeds that worm of an evil conscience
that never dies. In the best, they procure much ruth, though not utter ruin.
The sweet ways of my youth (says a man afterward eminent for holiness) did
breed such worms in my soul, as that my heavenly Father will have me yet a
little while continue my bitter Wormseed, because they cannot otherwise be
killed. Thus he Holy David prays hard, Psalm. 25.7. Remember not against me
the sins of my youth. Austin was much in the same suit. That age of man's life
is very subject to, and usually very full of sin, yea reproachful evils, jer.
31.19. Fleshly lusts that war against the soul, 1 Pet. 2.12. and like so many
noisome diseases soak into the bones, and suck out the marrow, to the
consumption and destruction of the whole man.

Which shall lie down with him in the dust; that is, says Vatablus, God will
so forsake him, that he shall never repent, but shall dye in his sins, which is
worse then to dye in prison, or to dye in a ditch; for they that dye n sin,
shall rise in sin, and stand before Christ in sin, and how shall they be able
to stand before him?

Verse 12. Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth.] As poison swallowed in
some pleasing meat or drink. Agrippine, in poisoning her husband Claudius the
Emperor, tempered it in meat he most delighted in. Poison given in Wine, works
more furiously, as did that Wassail the Monk drank to King John of England.
That wickedness with a witness here meant, is oppression, and is said to be
held in the mouth, and hid under the tongue, as some think, because it is often
covered with godly speeches, whereby he seeks to circumvent and deceive his
neighbor. Others by these expressions will have understood continuance in sin
and complacency therein, rolling it under his tongue, as a child does a piece
of sugar, which he is loath to part with, Arist Ethic. l. 3 Aelian. var. bist.
l. 10.
and retaining it a long thime in his mouth that he may taste it with more
pleasure. Philo^enus wished his neck were as long as a Cranes, that he might
the longer keep the taste of his sweetmeats and dainty morsels. Such is the
wicked man's wish, and his practice is answerable: for and his tongue is
mischief and vanity, Psalm. 1.7. He licks his lips with the remembrance of his
former sins, and so recommitteth them in his desires, at least, whilst he
recalleth former acts with delight. Thus the rebellious Israelites called to
mind the Fleshpots of Egypt, and were moved: and thus afterward they
multiplied their whoredoms by calling to remembrance the days of their youth,
wherein they had gone a whoring in the Land of Egypt, Ezekiel. 23.21.

Verse 13. Though he spa^^ it, and forsake it not.] This is the same in sense
with the former verse, and the second time repeated, that Job might know, that
he was the man here meant; Vt qui in malis artibus siti placaisset, says
Merlin, as one who took pleasure in raising himself upon another ruins. And
another good Note the same Author gives here, viz. That as any thing is more
sweet and delectable to the sensual appetite, so much the more should we
suspect it, as fearing a snare laid for us therein, by that old manslayer.
Vipera latet in veprecula. Diabolus capite blanditur, ventre oblictat, (...)
light. Divorce the flesh from the devil, and then there is no no great danger.

But keeps is still within his mouth] And will not be drawn to spet it out by
confession, and to carry it through the dung-port of his mouth into the brook
Kedro^, which was the Town-ditch. Satan knows there is no way to purge the
sick soul but upwards. He therefore labors to hold his lips close, that the
soul may not disburden it self, and God come in with his Cordi^ls of comfort.
See the Note on the former verse.

Verse 14. Yet his meat in his bo^els is turned] Sour ^^uce he has at length
to his sweet meats; viz. Gripes and throbs of conscience, terrors and tortures
inexpro^^ble; a greedy Vulture feeding upon his entrails (as the Poets fained
of Prometheus) those Furies or hell-hags, (so much mentioned by them) as
hanting evildoers. In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare, Prove.
29.6. There is a cord to strangle his joys with, to man his mirth. Did not
Joseph's brethren experiment this? and Ahab in his house of ivory? and
Belshazzar amidst his sensualities? Principium dulce est, sed finis amoris
amarus:
La^^ venire Venas, tristis abire solet.
The sinners cup of honey ends in the dregs of gall, even the gall of Asps.
Volupi^ and Angorom went y^aled together among the Romans. Did men but forecast
the said issues of sin, they durst not but be innocent.

It is the gall of Asps within him.] Gall of any sort is bitter, but that of
Asps is most poisonful and mortal. Pliny says, that the poison of Asps is
nothing else but their gall. An Asp is a kind of serpent, not know in these
parts of the world. Ea^^^titeth, That the biting of an Asp is uncurable; and
others say, that it kills without remedy with in four hours space. Unto this
kind of poison is sin fitly compared; for when an Asp stingeth a man, it does
first tickle him so as it makes him laugh, then it casts him into a sleep,
till the poison by little and little gets to the heart after which it paineth
him more then ever before it delighted him: So does wickedness. (...)
Duleacidum.
It is a bitter-sweet. Bernard compares it to the itch, which first yielded
pleasure, and afterward smart. Austin says, Many devour that on earth which
they must digest in hell, where they shall have punishment without pity, misery
without mercy, sorrow without succor, mischief without measure, torments
without end, and past imagination. When therefore thou art making a covenant
with sin, say to thy soul, as Boaz said to his kinsman, Ruth 4.4. What time
thou buyest it, thou must (...) Ruth with it. So, if thou will have the sweet
of sin, thou must have the (...) with it, and let thy soul answer, as he there
does, No, I may not do it, I shall (...).

Verse 15. (...) down riches.] As wild beasts do their prey, as the greater
fishes do the lesser, greedily, easily, suddenly, recoverably as the fire
swalloweth up the fuel, as the lean Kine devoured the far and as the Pamphagus
glutton does his tid bits, his sweet morsels. This word, Has swollowed.
shows his infinite and unsatiate desire of getting and gathering riches; and
that by continual gaping after more, he loses the pleasure of what he has
already. Like as a dog at his Masters table swalloweth the whole meat he
casts him without any pleasure, gaping still for the next morsel. He knows
no other language but that of the Horte Leethes daughter, Give, give; or that
of greedy Ese^, returning from the field, as hungry as an Hunter, Genesis 25.30.
Feed me I pray thee, or, (...) me swallow at ^^er (like as Camels are fed by
casting gobbets into cheir mouth) (...) red, red, etc. Gold is no better then
red earth, and cannot terminate man's Eccles 5.10.

And he shall vomit them up again] Either by remorse and restitution in the
mean time, or by despair and impenitent horror hereafter; He shall vomit them
up, and together with them his vital blood and spirits: he shall bring up his
very heart withal, as Judas did, together with those thirty pieces of silver,
Mat. 27.4. all his bowels gushing out, Act. 1.18. He thought to have digested
his ill g^^ten goods, as the Estrich does iron: but Pelican-like, he is forced
to cast them up again. The Whale that swallowed Jonah found him hard meat,
(...) Pelicanus a vomitu. Vide Plin. l. 10. c. 30. Graci eleganter tropo
explicato.
and for his own ease was forced to regurgitate. Think the same of this
wretched Mammonist. The Septuagint interpret the Text, when they thus render
it, Wealth unjustly gathered soal be vomited up again, and an Angel shall bale
it out of his mouth. An evil Angel, say their Interpreters: But the Hebrew
verity refers it to God, as an act of his divine justice.

God shall cast them out of his belly] As by a Writ of Ejectment, or rather, as
by a violent purgation that shall work both ways, Jer. ^1.44. I will punish
Bell in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth what he has swallowed
up; viz. the wealth of the Nations round about him. This God will take out of
his belly, so that a piece of his heart shall go with it. In the last
destruction of Jerusalem, some of the Jews had swallowed their gold, that the
roman soldiers might not have it; this was found out, and thereupon thousands
of them were killed and ripped up, for the gold that might be found in their
stomachs and bowels. In like sort shall God deal with those covetous Gaitives,
that have devoured the riches of iniquity; that have sucked in pestilential
Air, as hos. 8.7. See the Note there.

Verse 16. He shall suck the poison of Asps] That lies in his head, whence
also it has its name in the Original. See the Note on verse. 14. Caput aspidis
suget, says the Vulgar. It is said of the Toad that he has in his head a
stone of great virtue called Buf^nites. But the Asp has nothing in his head
but strong poison. This the rich wretch shall suck. Like as he was went to suck
the blood of the poor oppressed, to eat their flesh, Psalm. 14.4. and to
eviscerate them.

The Vipers tongue shall slay him] Perinde cade^ timale ficium, says Junius:
His wickedness shall prove his bane, unless he presently take the Antidotes
of Repentance where by to expel the poison^re it get to the vitals. Repentance
is the souls best vomit, the hardest, but wholsomest Physic. It is Repentance
unto life, whereas the sins of the impenitent are mortal, says Saint John 1
ep. 5.17. or rather Immortal as says Saint Paul, (...) The hand that is here
and elsewhere lifted up in threatening. Isai. 26 11. will fall down in punishing.
The wages of sin is death When the Barbarians saw the Viper hanging on Saint
Paul's hand, they looked when he would fall down dead, Acts 28 46. The devils
design want here to have slain Paul, but he was defeated. And Brentius
holds that the Metaphor here used is taken not so much from Serpents, whose
venom lies in their tongues, as from Satan, Brent. in loc.
who by the Serpent in Paradise, cast our first parents into all kind of evils.
Another there is, who thus descanteth upon this Text, Caput Viperis suget. When
Vipers engender, the female sucketh the head of the male, and biteth it off
with great delight; then she conceives her young ones, which eat out her
belly: So the Oppressor, getting the poor man's goods, they seem sweet unto
him, but at the last his sin finds him out, for it biteth like a Serpent, and
stingeth like an Adder, as Sermon says of drunkenness (which Austin calls,
dulce vemenum, a sweet poison) Prove. 23.32.

Verse 17. Mercer.
He shall not see the Rivers, the floods, etc.] that is, that plenty and
abundance of all good things that comes in to the righteous, Velut confertim,
certatim, and affati^^, a confluence of all manner of comforts and
contentments. These the Oppressor shall have none of; for being insatiable and
vexed with the furies of an evil conscience, they enjoy not any thing, though
they abound with all things, being worse then Tantalized: and if after his fall
he seek to recruit himself, he shall never be able to effect it. He shall not
see the Rivers, etc. The Seventy, and others after them render it by an elegant
Apostrophe, Ne spectes rivos, Let him never look after the Rivers, etc. for it
will never be. He may please himself in hope and expectation of a better
condition, but God will surely cross him. For his hoped for riches he shall
have poverty, for pleasure pain, for health sickness, for nourishment poison,
for dignity disgrace, for the favor of God, his wrath and hatred, for life
destruction. A further account of the wicked man's non-enjoyment of what he had
wrongfully wrested from others, Zophar gives us in the next verse.

Verse 18. That which he labored for shall he restore.] (Great pains he has
taken to small purpose) in hope to make him self happy, the result whereof is,
Reddet laborem, he shall restore his labor, either by regret and remorse of
conscience, or by Law, or by force, he shall be made to restore his ill-gotten
goods, which he had labored for even to lassitude; for wicked men are sore
workmen, and oppressors are great pains-takers; Nazian.
(...), in getting wealth unweariable.

And shall not swallow it down] Or if he do, as verse. 15. it shall be but as
the fish swalloweth the hook, or as the Whale swallowed Jonah, ill at ease till
he had laid up again.

According to his substance Ball the restitution be.] hebr. According to the
substance fo his exchange. Opes compensationis, the riches of his recompense,
so the word is rendered, chap. 15.31. The Oppressor is so infatuated, that he
looks upon his cursed hoards as the reward of his labor, and rejoices in that
where of he has more reason to repent, as Leah said at the birth of her son
Issachar, (but not well) God has given me my hire, because I have given my
maiden to my husband, Genesis 30. 18. Felix scelus virtus vocatur: Dionysius
gloryed, that the Gods disliked not his Sacrilege, because they punished him
not presently. But what faith Zophar here?

He shall not rejoice therein] Or if he do for a while, yet the tryumphing of
the wicked is but short, ver. 5. as a blaze of thorns under a pot, or as a
flash of lightning, which is followed by rending and roaring; he shall be
filled with unmedicinable sorrows, when his Gold (his God) is taken from him,
when he parts with that whereon he had set his heart, and built his felicity.

Verse 19. Because he has oppressed and forsaken the poor.] Hebr. Because he
has crushed or broken in pieces. The Original word imports (as One well
observes) Tyrannical Oppression without mercy or moderation, without ho or
hold: some give full scope to their rage and wrath, they put neither bond nor
bridle upon their covetousness and cruelty: such are characterized by this
word.

And forsaken the poor.] Or, Left men poor; viz. by letting them without a
livelihood, and so as good as without life. A poor man in his house, is like a
snail in his shell, crush that, and you kill him They which read it, And for
saken the poor, give us this good Note, That as it is sinful to forsake the
poor, though we have never oppressed them, Matthew. 25.35, 36. (Not to do Justice
is Injustice, not to show mercy is cruelty, Mark 3.4) so to oppress, and then
forsake them, is far more sinful.

Because he has violently taken away.] Violently and in open view, in an
impudent manner, He pulls down men's houses, but never thinks of repairing
them; so some read this Text. Let our Depopulators look to it, who build
themselves desolate places, and desire to live alone in the earth. This has
been noted as a great fault in our Nation. And therefore Goropius thinks the
English were called Augli, because they were so good Anglers, having skill to
lay diverse baits when they fished for other men's livings.

Verse 20. Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly.] i. e. Peace in
his conscience, satisfaction in his soul; but as he is still coveting more,
being sick of a Dropsy or Bulimy, as it were; so he has many inward gripings
and grabbings, worse then any belly ache or sickness of the stomach: he never
eats to the satisfying of his soul as the righteous man does, but the belly
of the wicked shall want, Prove, 13.25. His meat is so sawced, and his drink so
spiced with the wrath of God, that he has no joy of it: His belly is pained,
his mind is in perpetual turmoile, whiles, like a Ship laden, but not filled
up, he has enough to sink him, but not enough to satisfy him.

He shall not save of that which he desired.] Which he coveted with strong
desire, and had as lief have been knocked on the head as parted with, as his
Plate, Wardrobe Jewels, etc. neither can he save them, nor they him. Broughton
renders, By that which he desired, he shall not be safe: and to like purpose,
the Septuagint,

Verse 21. There shall none of his meat be left.] Zophar still pursues the
Allegory of the belly; and in all, strikes at poor Job, who had scarce a bit
of bread to eat, but yet was not without the hidden Manna, the feast of a good
conscience, which made him say with Luther, Mendecato pant hic vivamus, etc.
Let us take up with course fare here, since we have better within, and better
yet we shall have in heaven: in our Fathers house is bread enough, etc.

Therefore no man shall look for his goods.] Heb. His goods, or goodness, It
was well said, That he that first called riches, Bona, Goods, was a better
husband then Divine: But it may be thought that the most are such husbands. The
common cry is, Who will show us any good? The Lord answers, Exodus 33.19. I
will make all my good pass before thee, and I will proclaim the Name of the
Lord before thee. The Prophet answers, Mic. 6.8. He has showed thee, O man,
what is good. viz. to do justly: and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy
God. Nevessen.
But most men are of his mind who said. He that will not venture his body, will
never be valiant, and he that will not venture his soul, will never be rich.
But what says the Prophet? He that gets riches, and not by right, shall dye
a poor fool, Jer. 17.11. And what says Zophar here? He shall dye a plain
beggar, and leave no estate worth the looking after, or suing for: this falls
not out always, but (...) many times it does, as is easily to be observed.

Verse 22. In the fullness of his sufficiency be shall be in straits] The
covetous man never has a sufficiency (but is as greedily gasping still after
more, as if he were not worth an halfpenny) much less a fullness of
sufficiency, a superfluity, a superabundance. What soever Esan pretended in
his, I have enough my brother, Genesis 33.9. Jacob could indeed say truly, I have
enough. ver. 11. for godliness only has an autarkie, 1 Timothy 6.6. True piety
has true plenty, and is never with out a well-contenting sufficiency, wherein
the good man is, when is the fullness of straits. See it in David, 1 Samuel 30.6.
in Habakkuk. chap. 3.16, 17. in Paul, 2 Cor. 6.10. Phil. 4-11. he had nothing,
and yet possessed all things. But that which Zophar here drives at, is to show
that the Oppressor shall be ruinated when at highest, and when he least
looks for it; as was Nebuchadnezzar, Haman, Belshazzar, Babylon the great,
Rev. 18.7, 8. How was Alexander the Great surprised at a Feast? Caesar in the
Senate house? many of the Emperors in their own Palaces, etc?

Every hand of the wicked shall come upon him] Or, Of the Labourer, whose wages
he has detained. Or, of the poor oppressed, whom he has forced to labor hard
for a poor living. Broughton renders it, Each hand of the injured and grieved
shall come upon him; and so he shall have many fists about his ears, many ready
to rifle him and to pull a fleece from him.

Verse 23, When he is about to fill his belly] It appears by this expression,
that it was belly timber wherein the wicked man placed his sufficiency, ver.
22. his felicity Si ventri bone sit si lateri. says the Epicure in Horace. If
the belly may be filled, the body fitted, that is all that these Lurcones, these
Losels look after. Pelyphemus knew no other God but his belly. There were
belly-gods in Saint Paul's time, such as of whom be could not speak with dry
eyes, Phil 3.18-19. Such are compared by Clemens Alexandrinus to the
Sea-castle, that has his heart in his belly: By others to the Locust, the
belly whereof is said to be joined to his mouth, and to end at his tail: to
the fish called Blax, that is altogether unprofitable: and to Rats and Mice,
good for nothing but to devour victuals. When therefore such a Pamphagus is
about to fill his belly and to pamper his panch, or otherwise to gorge himself
with the full messes of sins Dainties (as the Viper lives on venomous things,
the Spider on Aconite, the Sow on swill, as Tartarians on Carrion, holding them
as dainty as other men do Venison) then, says Zophar,

God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him] Heb. He shall send forth, etc.
He will no longer keep in his judgments in the chains of mercy, but give them
their full forth upon this wicked Oppressor; and that even very then, when he
bids his heart make merry, and assures himself of unchangeable happiness. For,

He shall rain it upon him (that is, reveal it from heaven against him, Romans
1.) while he is eating] As it befell chose Cormorants, Numb. 11.33. and the old
world, Luke 17. Matthew. 24.38
Sudden destruction comes upon them, as travel upon a woman with child; Vel ut
pluvia quae sereno coelo inopinantes opprimit; Or as foul weather that comes
unsent for, and often unlooked for. The Vulgar renders it, And he shall rain his
war upon him. But this Zophar sets forth in the next verse, where he
denounces war and weapons.

Verse 24. He shall flee from the iron weapons.] i. e. whiles he seeks to shun
one mischief, he shall fall into another: and when he thinks to run from death,
he runs to it. God, who can do what he will with his own bare hand, is here
brought in after the manner of men with sword and bow, to show, that both at
home and afar off he can tame his Rebels. Neither boots it any man to stand out
with God, or to seek to save himself by sight or flight: since he is that King
against whom there is no rising up. Prove. 30.31. and if he be angry, no other
helps can relieve us. Brass and iron can fence me against an Arrow or a sword,
but if I were to be cast into a furnace of fire, it would help to torment me,
if into a pit of water to sink me. Now our God is a consuming fire, and his
breath a stream of brimstone, Isai. 30.33. Submit your selves therefore to God,
Jam. 4.7. Humble your selves therefore under his mighty hand, and he shall lift
you up in due season, 1 Pet. 5. To run into God, is the way to escape him: as
to close and get in with him that would strike you, does avoid the blow.

And the bow of steel shall strike him through] Or, shall change him; that is,
kill him: Death is our great change, and to the wicked a dismal change, for they
shall be killed with death Rev. 2.23. Then Balaam and his bribes, Baltasar and
his bowls. Dives and his dishes, Herod and his Harlots, the Usurer and his
bills, the Merchant and his measures, etc. shall part asunder for ever. But
that is not the worst of it: The word here used signifies excision or cutting
off, and hence that of Bathsheba, Prove. 31.8. Been chaloph. children of
destruction, answerable to that of our Savior, John 17.12. A son or child of
perdition; that is, a man devoted to utter destruction.

Verse 25. It is drawn and comes out of the body.] that is, the Arrow out of
the Quiver, or the sword out of the sheath (as the Vulgar translateth it.) By a
like Metaphor the body is called the souls sheath, Dan. 7.15. But I rather take
it properly: It comes out of his body; that is, out of the wicked man's body,
who is under such a deep and deadly wound as Jehoram was, whom Jehu shot
through the heart: and as William Rufus was by Walter-Tirrel, who in hunting
mistook him for a Dear.

Yea the glistering sword comes out of his gall] And so the wound must needs
be mortal, since none can come at the gall to cure it. The wicked shall be
double slain, (first with Gods bow, and then with his sword) rather then he
shall escape. How much better were it, to fall down as Paul did, Romans 7. slain
with the sword of the Spirit? Bernard told his brother, a soldier, that
because he would not listen to the word of exhortation, God would shortly open
a way to his hard heart by his glistering sword; which accordingly befell him.

Terrors are upon him] Heb. the terrible upon him; which some interpret of
Devils hell-hags. The Vulgar renders it, Then horrible outs shall come upon
him. The word is used for Giants, Deuteronomy. 2.10. The Emins shall fall upon him,
that is, men of fierce and cruel spirits. But better take it for terrors, as we
render it; and so the sense is, That the wicked when he sees he must needsly
dye, is surprised with greatest anxieties and perplexities of spirit, as
beholding that threefold dreadful spectacle, Death, Judgment, Hell, and all to
be passed through by his poor soul.

Verse 26. All darkness shall be bid in his secret place] That is, says
Diodate, wheresoever he shall think to find a place of safeguard, there shall
he meet with some horrible mischance. Men that are proscribed, and sought for
to death, usually hide themselves, as diverse Jews did in Privies at the last
destruction of Jerusalem, and were thence drawn out to the slaughter. The Duke
of Buckingham in Richard 3 his time was betrayed by his servant Bannister.
Appianus tells of a Roman hid by his wife, De Bell. Civ. Romans
and then discovered by his wise to the Murderer, to whom she soon after also
was married. Others render and sense the words thus, The wicked shall come into
darkness, propter abscondita. for his secret sins. And others thus, R. Sell.
All darkness is laid up for his hid treasures: that is, God, or men have
taken order that he shall lose his riches as well as his life, though he hide
them never so secretly.

A fire not blown shall consume him] i. e. say some, calamities whose causes
shall be unknown, and shall proceed immediately from God. See Isai. 30.33.
Many of the Greeks interpret this Text of Hell, with its unquenchable fire,
Matthew. 3.12. which being created by God, and kindled by its breath, that is, by
his Word, it burns everlastingly. Albeit God many times punishes wicked men
here with fire from heaven, as he did Sodom. Nadab and Abihu, those Captiances
of fifties with their companies, 2 King. 1. Tremellius renders it thus, A fire
consumes him, non accensum flatu, I say Him. not kindled by blowing, but
burning of his own accord, Vt stipule aut stupae. Ut cremium aut arefactum
liguum.
as stubble fully dried, or hurds, or sear wood. See Nab 1.10. with the Note.

It shall go ill with him that is left.] His posterity shall never prosper, but
be rooted out. Eliphaz and Bildad had said the same thing: and all to pay poor
Job, whose family was now ruined. It shall surely go ill with him, or, He shall
be wringed, says Broughton; alluding belike to the sound as well as the sense
of the Hebrew word.

Verse 27. The heaven shall reveal his iniquity] Job had called heaven and
earth to record of his innocence. chap 16.17, 18. This is not to do now. says
Zophar. for all creatures have conspired thy ruin, and contributed thereunto,
Wind, Fire, Sabeans, etc. so that he that has but half an eye, may see thee to
be a wicked person. Such as are wicked indeed. not only secundum dici. as Job.
but secundum esse, as Ahab, cannot look to heaven above, or to earth beneath,
without horror to think even these, if other witnesses fail, shall bring to
light their secret sins, and come to give testimony against them before the
great Judge at the last day.

And the earth shall arise up against him.] Night will convert it self into
Noon against the evildoers: and silence prove a speaking evidence. Earth cried
Cain guilty, the Stars in their courses fought against Sisera as a Traitor and
Rebel to the highest Majesty; Yea, -- Servi ut taceant jumenta loquentur. the
Ass has a verdict to pass upon Balaam. A Bird of the Air shall carry the
voice that but whispereth Treason, Eccles. 10.20. Yea if nothing else will
reveal iniquity, it will reveal it self. It will prove like the Ointment of
the right hand, of which Solomon says, that it wrayeth it self, Prove. 27.16.

Verse 28. The increase of his house shall depart] All his posterity shall be
destroyed, and so shall his prosperity too, even all at once with a sudden ebb,
in the day that God visits him with his wrath and righteous judgments. All
the wicked man's wealth and revenue shall be wretchedly wasted and embezelled by
one means or other.

And his goods shall flow away] As waters. The Apostle says, The fashion of
the world passes away; viz. as a hasty headlong torrent; or as a Picture drawn
upon the ice, Thou carriest them away (both persons and things) as with a
flood, Psalm. 90.5.

Verse 29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God] A portion God allows
the wicked in this life, Psalm. 17.14. As a King when he reprieveth a Traitor,
allows him a subsistence, prisoners pitance at least. Yes, the worst of men
divide the wealth and honors of the world between them for a time.
Nebuchadnezzar had Tyr^s as pay for his pains in Egypt. And the whole Turkish
Empire is nothing else but a crust cast to his dogs, by the great house keeper
of the world, says Luther. But besides this, God has provided a far other
portion for them (says One) and that by way of inheritance, never to be parted
from them; viz. all the forementioned miseries, and many more, all torments
here, and tortures in hell. This is the inheritance, Quam nunquam deserere, non
magis quam seipsos, pottrunt, which will stick to them as close as the skin to
the flesh, or the flesh to the bones: it falls to them as the inheritance does
to the heir, chap. 27.13. and 31.2. or as the mess of meat does to the invited
Guest. Misery is the heritage of the wicked, as they are children of
disobedience; and their wages as they are workers of iniquity: their present
prosperity also is a piece of their punishment, Isai. 1.5. Prove. 1.32. The
words of Zophar are ended. Let others reply as they please, but he has done.
Prastat herbam dare, quam turpiter pugnare. No surer sign of an evil cause then
a powerless pertinacy.

CHAP. XXI. Verse 1. But Job answered and said.]
Disproving and refuting that Proposition of theirs concerning the infelicity
of the ungodly by Reason, by Experience, and by Divine Authority: All which
evince and evidence, that neither is prosperity a proof of men's innocence, nor
adversity a mark of their wickedness, as Zophar and his fellows would have
it. And that they might not any more interrupt him, nor think him too rough, he
uses a gentle Preface, craving attention, and pressing them thereunto by many
Arguments in the six first verses.

Verse 2. Hear diligently my speech] Heb. In hearing hear. The Greek has it,
Hear, hear; that is, hear me out, have so much patience with me as not to
interrupt me any more; yea, hear with understanding: Let your (...) and (...)
meet: draw up your inward ea^es to your outward, that one sound may pierce
both. Lay aside passion and prejudice, Gravis rationis humanae morbus est, quod
plerungue soleat ea damnare qua aut non intelligat, aut non placu^rit. Brent.
suffer a word of information, for it is but one word that I have to say, etc.
the Hebrew is singular, and promises brevity. Only this one word Job would
that they should heafe double; scil. by an after deliberate meditation, as
David did, Psalm. 62.11. God has spoken once, twice have I heard that etc.

And let this be your consolations] Comfort me this way at least, that you will
give me the hearing. Hither you came as Comforters, but by your galling
speeches you have grieved and vexed me above measure. Now make me some amends,
and remembering your Office as friends, and your design, which was to condole
with me, and to comfort me, hear me hardly, and this I shall take as kindly, as
if in tenderest compassion you had drunk to me in a Bowl of Nepenthes, or had
given me a oup of consolation, as Jer, 10.7. The Vulgar Latin renders it,
(but not well) Hear I pray for my speech, and repent. The Hebrew robe
signifies first to repent, and then to comfort, 1 Samuel 15.35. Isas. 40.1.
became the penitent only, get sound comfort.

Verse 3. Suffer me that I may speak] Say that it be suffering to you to hear
me (for now I see you have, as they write of some Creatures, feb in ^^re;) yet
put your selves to the pain of hearing me, and beat me though I am burdensome
to you, though my speeches cross the grain of your spirits. See 2 Cor. 11.1.
I will promise you to speak nothing worthy of a scoff, such as was that of
Theophrast^^, Let him shun the ^^^^tive man who would not be put into a ^it of
a feavee. Theoph. Charact (...) de garrul.
Or that of Aristotle, before whom when one having made a long and idle
discourse, concluded it thus, I doubt I have been too tedious unto you, Sir
Philosopher, Plut. de garrn. lit.
with my many words In good sooth, said Aristotle, you have not been tedious to
me, for I gave no heed to any thing you said.

And after I have spoken, mock on] Heb. M^^^ thou on, thou Zoph^r, (to whom he
turned his speech, and very likely his eye also) if thou can find in thy
heart to mock at so much reason, as I shall allege in mine own defense, I
gainstand thee not. He wanted no wit that said, If a wise man speak evil of
thee, or to thee, Chrysostom.
endure him; if a fool, slight him. Sile, and funestam dedisti plagam, trouble
not thy self at his taunts, and thou punishest him sufficiently.

Verse 4. As for me, is my complaint to man?] Vult dicere. says Lavater, Jobs
meaning is, that he complained not to man, but to God himself, who well knew
his heart and his innocence, though men mis-judged him. And this being so, how
could he be otherwise then anxious and solicitous, since if a man be but to
speak to an earthly Prince, he will be afraid? It is said of Charles the Fifth,
Emperor, that he spoke more to God then to men. Job did so, it seems: and
this he alleges to the shame of his hard-hearted friends, who put him to it
in this sort.

Verse 5. Mark me, and be astonied] Heb. Look upon me. He had said before, Hear
and hear, now, Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow. Mark
it I say, and stand amazed at it. Did you ever find any on this side hell so
sore afflicted as I am? Is it not because you are not duly affected with my
miseries, that ye are so regardlesse of my discourse. Strange, that my sorrows
should be great enough to work astonishment, and yet not great enough to
deserve attention. O mark first what I suffer, and then what I speak.

And (this once done) lay your hand upon your month] Be swift to hear but slow
to speak: yea, spare to speak at all in this case. The Greek Proverb
admonishes men either to be silent, or to speak something that is better then
silence. Harpocrates the heathenish god of silence, was pictured with his
finger laid upon his lips.

Verse 6. Even when I remember I am afraid] Surprised I am with a most
formidable amazement, when I call to mind and consider how ill (by the divine
Providence) it fares with me, how well with many wicked; and how little you
pity me, or seek by sound reason to settle my mind; I am ready to cry out, Oh
the depth of Gods stupendous dispensations! Confer Psalm. 73. where David
delivers himself to like purpose.

And trembling takes hold on my flesh] Heb. My flesh has taken hold on
trembling. Totus horreo, Horror has taken hold on me, Psalm. 119.53. such as
makes my body to shake and shudder. So Habak. 3.16. With chap. 1.3, 13. Job had
called upon his friends to mark and be astonished: here he propounds himself
to them for an example. Quod jussit, and gessit, as Bernard says of Another.
See chap. 18.20.

Verse 7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old?] Vivunt, veterascunt, they
are lively and long lived, so that they out-last many better then themselves;
being as sound as Roches, and as vivacious as the snail, the property whereof
is to live a long while even after the head is off, and the heart out. Of some
creatures we use to say, that they have nine lives: of some wicked men it may
be thought so, they do evil an hundred times, and yet their days are
prolonged, Eccles. 9.12. Manasseh reigned longest of any King in Judah. Pope
John the 22 (that Monster and Mortallist) lived longest of any Pope, and dyed
richest. God gives wealth, health, and long life to many wicked, Non aliter ac
siquis crumenam ingentem auro plenam lutrine injiciat, Gasp. E^^.
says One: No otherwise then as when a man casts a great Purse filled with
Gold into a Jakes. Now if any shall ask, with Job, Why all this? The Apostle
answers one Question by another, Romans 922. What if God willing to show his
wrath, and to make his power known, endure with much long-suffering the vessels
of wrath fitted to destruction? What has any man to say to that? And again,
who knows not that the Lord has appointed a day wherein he will judge the
world in righteousness, even that day of the Revelation of the righteous
judgment, Acts 17.31. Romans 2.5. The Judge of the earth keeps his petty
Sessions now, letting the Law pass upon some few, reserving the rest till the
great Assizes, 1 Timothy 5.24.

Yea, are mighty in power.] Or, Prevail in wealth, which makes them mighty:
for money is the Monarch of this present world, and carries all before it.

Verse 8. Their seed is established in their sight with them] Some understand
it of their seed sown in the fields; not blasted or wasted, but timely
gathered into their Barnes and Granaries; and so by Off spring, Germina, they
taking it literally, conceive to be meant their plants, Multos, sanos, vegetos,
and vivaces.
trees, flowers, fruits, all which come kindly, and grow to their minds; But
better interpret it of their children and nephews, whom they have many,
healthy, lusty and lively, and not unfitly compared to seed; as if the parents
were but only the husks: and to branches or sprigs, because they may be, and
must be bent betime to the best things, before they be aged and crooked in
their evil practices, refusing to be rectified.

And their Offspring before their eyes] This is the same with that before, and
is repeated, because a singular happiness, to see their children prosper as
much as themselves. This is a third time instanced, ver. 11.

Verse 9. Their houses are safe from fear] Seculi Latitia est impunita
nequitia. No domestical scords, no foreign disturbances, but peaceable
possession and enjoyment of that they have; as much welfare as David wished to
Nabal, 1 Samuel 25.5. Thus shall ye say to him that lives (that is, that lives
prosperously, for that is the only life) Peace be to thee, and to thine house,
and to all that thou have.

Neither is the rod of God upon them] So that they seem to themselves and
others to be out of the reach of Gods rod. They are not in trouble as other
men, neither are they plagued like other men: Therefore pride compasses them
about as a chain, August.
etc. Psa. 73.5, 6. Vermis divitiarum est superbia, It is hard for the rich not
be high-minded, 1 Timothy 6.17.

Verse 10. Their Bull gendreth and fails not, etc.] All things hit, and
nothing misseth to make them happy and wealthy; they have profit and pleasure
at will, the world comes tumbling in upon them, as Towns were said to come in
to Timotheus his toils, Plu^. in Syll.
whiles he slept; and so they seem to be the only heirs of those Promises (
Exodus 23.26. There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren in the Land. So
Deuteronomy. 7.14) whereunto notwithstanding they are perfect strangers; Laban and
Nabal for instance.

Verse 11 They send forth their little ones like a flock.] Sunt quide eorum
vitulis intelligunt recens natis, says Mercer, Some understand it of young
Calves, but better of young children, which have here their name from a root
which signifies wickedness, naughtiness, to show what little ones are, not
Innocents, as we call them, not pueri quasi puri; (...), is both a fool and a
child. The first blanket wherein a child is wrapped, is woven of sin, shame,
blood and filth, Ezekiel. 16.4, 6. Hence Infants were circumcised, and their
foreskin cast away, to show, that themselves had deserved to be so served.
Parents therefore should strive to mend that by education, which they have
marred by propagation. Wicked parents think not on this, though they send out
their little ones like a flock, but tend them not, keep them not from the Wolf
of hell, who seeks to devour them.

And their children dance] Exiliunt, vitulantur, ch^reas ducunt, they skip and
leap up and down, Nemo sobrius saltat. Cic.
as young cattle, and are taught to dance Artificially, which no sober man will
do, says Cicero: And the better Dancer, the worse man, said Diogenes.

Verse 12. They take the Timbr^l and the Harp] They take them, and are taken
with them, being melted in sensual delights, which wise men slight. The
Philosopher told the Fiddlers, that he could be merry without Music. Aristotle
said, Jupiter is happy, Plut, (...).
and yet no Musician. One in Plutarch says of the Scythians, That though they
had no Music nor Vines amongst them, yet they had God. It is here alleged as
a piece of their lasciviousness and luxury, that they took or touched the
Timbrel, etc. Not but that Music is lawful, for it is the gist of God, and a
noble Note there) these wicked and their children lived in pleasure upon earth
(which is not a place for such a purpose: God did not cast man out of one
Paradise; that he might make himself another) James 5.5. and were like the
people of T^mbu^^^ in Africa, who are said to spend their whole time in
singing and dancing. It is not good for men to take pleasure in pleasure, to
spend too much time in it, as Solomon did, and afterward Cleopatra. It was not
simply a sin in Esau to go a hunting: but yet the more he used it, the more
profane he waxed, and came at length to contemn his birthright.

They rejoice at the sound of the Organ] Their mirth was merely carnal, they
did rather revel then rejoice. Their cheerfulness did not end in
thankfulness; their Music made them not more heavenly minded, as it did that
late Learned and holy Mr. Esty, who when he sat and heard a sweet consort of
Music, D. Hall Art of Div. Medit.
seemed upon this occasion, carried up for the time before hand to the place of
his Rest, saying very passionately, What Music may we think there is in
heaven? The Instrument here mentioned, has its name (as Mercer notes) Ab
amore oblectatione, and lusu; From love, delight and sport. Amabit sapiens,
cupient caters, says S^utea.

Verse 13 They spend their days in wealth.] Or, in mirth: Hebr. In good. They
wallow in wealth, and have the world at will, even more then heart could wish,
as David phraseth it in Psalm 73. which may well serve for a Comment upon this
Text; And the rich glutton for an instance. He in his lifetime received his
good things, and in a moment went down to the grave, Luke 16.25. True it is,
that this is not every wicked man's case: for some of them live wretchedly, and
dye lamentably, being held long upon the rack of a torturing Disease (as
Jehoram) all which is to them no other then a Type and foretaste of hell,
whither they are hasting.

And in a moment they go down to the grave] Ad inferna, to hell, says the
Vulgar, they spend their days in wealth, and end their days in woe; their
merry dance determines in a miserable downfall. Thus that rich man dyed, and
was buried; and in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, etc, Luke
16.22, 23. But though the same Hebrew word signifies hell and the grave (both
which have their names from their unsatiablenesse, Prove. 30.15, 16) yet here,
in a sutablenesse to what went before, the grave is to be understood; and the
sense is, Dicto citius mori^^tur, they dye easily, suddenly, sweetly, without
much pain of body or trouble of mind: there are no bonds in their death, says
David, Psalm. 73. They dye without much ado, like a lamb, or like a lamp, that
goes out of it self when the oil fails: they go quickly and quietly to the
grave: some wicked persons indeed dye piecemeal by a complicate Disease, and a
long lingering Death, as did Antiochus, Herod, Philip 2 of Spain, etc. Dionysius
the Tyrant is said to have envyed a beast, whose throat he saw cut, because he
dyed so soon. Julius Caesar wished he might dye speedily, says Suetonius.
Pliny commends sudden death as the chief felicity of life. M^rs jucunda cujus
nulla pracesses expectatio aut me^^^.
That Is a good death to nature which is neither feared nor expected, yet that
is the best death which has been longest expected and prepared for. Happy is
he that after due preparation, is passed through the gates of death, ere he be
aware. Happy is he that by the holy use of long sickness, is taught to see the
gates of death afar off, and addresseth for a resolute passage. The one dies
like Eliah, the other like Elisha, both blessedly.

Verse 14. Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us.] Lest any should think,
says Merlin here, that Job speaks of such wicked as used a moderation in
sinning, and (as the Historian said of the Emperor) rather wanted vice, then
were virtuous. Magis extra vitia, quam cu^^ vir^utib^m. Tacit.
He describes their great impiety by a rhetorical imitation, expressing the
language of their heart, which is most base and blasphemous. For first they
bespeak God as if he were some low-prized scoundrel; Apage, Be packing: thus
they reject his acquaintance, and would be rid of his company. Porro rejiciunt
Deum quot quot verbum e^us contemnunt, says Brentius here: Now they reject
God, who slight his Word, and cast his commands behind them, Psalm. 50.17. Hence
it follows by way of explication.

For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.] Lo, they prosesse themselves to
be of the number of those, Qui us liberius peccent, libenter ignorant, who are
wilfully ignorant, and like not to retain God in their knowledge. Romans 1.28. or
if they profess to know him, yet in works they deny him, being abominable,
disobedient, and to every good work reprobate, Tit. 1.16. Wicked men cannot
abide God, such is their evil heart of unbelief, Heb 3.12. they get as far from
him as they can, with Cain, and not only desire him to depart out of their
coasts with those swinish Gergefires, but churlishly say unto him, as here,
Avaunt, Room for us. They will neither have God in their heads, Psalm. 10.4. nor
hearts, Psalm. 14.1. nor words, Psalm. 12.4. nor works, Tit. 1.16. See this
exemplified in those perverse Jews, lying children, children that would not
hear the Law of the Lord; which said to the Seers, see not, -- Get ye out of
the way, turn aside out of the path; i.e. out of this tract of truth in dealing
so plainly, and reproving us so roundly, Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease
before us, let us henceforth hear no more of him, Isai. 30.10, 11. Now for such
miscreants as these, who can say, it is otherwise then righteous, that God
should regest one day upon them, Depart from me, ye wicked? (He loves to
retaliate.) And that they who now say unto him, We desire not the knowledge of
thy ways, should hear from him, I tell you, I know you not, Luke 13.27?

Verse 15. What is the Almighty that we should serve him?] Here the rottenesse
of their hearts blistereth out at the lips of these rich wretches, these fat
Bulls of Basan, such as was Pharaoh that sturdy rebel, who asked this very
question in the Text, What, or Who is the Almighty, He seems to rehearse the
very words of Pharaoh. Diod.
etc? Exodus 5.2. and had a large Reply made him by one plague upon another,
till he was compelled to answer himself, The Lord is righteous. Forced he was
to speak fair whiles held upon the Rack, if for nothing else, yet that he might
get off. Such Queryings as this carry greatest contempt in them, and would lay
the Almighty quite below the required duty: as if Almighty were but an empty
title, and that he could do neither good nor evil, Zeph. 1.12. that it was to
no purpose or profit to serve him, that the gains would not pay for the
pains, etc.

And what profit should we have if we pray unto him?] Hebr. If we meet him,
viz. by our prayers, Jer. 7.16. Am. 4.12. see Mal. 3.14. with the Note.
Children will not say their prayers unless they may have their Breakfast; nor
hypocrites pray, but for some profit. They pretend sometimes to meet God, but
they draw not near with that true heart, mentioned, Heb. 10.22. in seeking God
they merely seek themselves, as Spira said he did. In Parabola ovis capras suas
quaerunt; No penny, no Pater Noster. And as the Wolfin the Fable, having
spelled Pater, and being bid put together, said Agnus: so when these pray,
their hearts are upon their half penny Ezekiel. 33. They follow Christ for the
loaves, and serve him no longer, then he serves their turns.

-- Rarae fumant soelicibus arae. Verse 16. Lo their good is not in their hand]
that is, They are not enriched by their own industry, Prudence, Piety, etc. but
God has exalted them thus, that he may bring them down again with the greater
poise: So some sense the Text. Others thus, Their good is not in their hand;
that is, they are not Masters of them, but are mastered by them: they are
servants to their wealth, as the Persian Kings were to their Wives or
Concubines, Plut.
Captivarum suarum caprivi: And as those stall-fed beasts in the Gospel, the
Recusant Guests I mean, that had bought Farms, Oxen, etc or rather were bought
of them. -- Difficile est opibus non tradere m^res. Others make this the sense,
and I concur with them, These wicked rich men, buried in a bog of security,
contemn God as if they had their happiness in their own hands, and were
petty-gods within themselves. But they are deceived; All is in Gods hand, who
can take away their wealth when he pleases. These men may fall sooner then
whey rose, since they subsist merely by Gods manutension, and he may do with his
own as he lists.

The counsel of the wicked is far from me] I am so far from envying their
prosperity, that I cannot approve of their course of life, for all their
wealth. I am not of their judgment, I like not of their way. Oh my soul come
not thou into their secret. Let their money perish with them (said that noble
Italian Convert to a Jesuit, Caracciol^^.
who tempted him with a great sum) who esteem all the gold in the world worth
one days society with Jesus Christ, and his Holy Spirit; and cursed be that
Religion for ever, etc.

Verse 17 How often is the candle of the wicked put out?] q.d. Diod.
I confess that which you say concerning Gods judgments upon the wicked to be
sometimes true in this world; yet it is not so continually, nor ordinarily, but
very often their lamp is extinguished, their comforts damped, and hopes of better
dashed: they are all on the sudden left in the dark, cast into straits
inextricable, plunged into sorrows inexplicable, and yet all these are but the
beginning of sorrows. For

How often comes destruction upon them?] Utmost destruction, irresistible ruin,
that comes on in manner of a black cloud, or fierce storm, undoing calamity,
overflowing scourge, a tempest from which there is no covert. The Vulgar
renders it thus, How often is there an inundation upon the wicked!

God distributeth sorrows in his anger] Gives them their lot of greatest
sorrows, as by a line, Luke 12.46. such sorrows as a traveling woman
suffers, Spec. bell. sac.
or such as were those of Monsieur Mylius, an ancient Minister at Heidelberg,
when taken by the Spaniard, first they abused his daughter before his eyes, and
then they tied a small cord about his head, which with truncheons they wreathed
about till they squeezed out his brains. The Text implies that though in this
world many sorrows are to the wicked, yet these are no supersedias to their
sufferings in hell; Psalm. 32.10.
but now they receive only a small portion or part of their punishments, there
they shall be paid to the full: here they sip of the top only of Gods cup,
there they shall suck up the dregs thereof, though they have eternity to the
bottom. This shall be the portion of their cup, and but a portion, Psalm. 11.6.

Verse 18. They are as stubble before the wind] Lest any man should say, How
can these things befall those that are so strongly set, and firmly built? Well
enough, says Job, since when they are best bottomed or underlaid, they are but
as stubble before the wind, etc. Haec consideranda, says Mercer, these things
would be laid to heart, for hereby it appears that the wicked shall be
destroyed suddenly, and certainly, certo, cito, penitus, Isai. 17.13. That they
can no more stand before a punishing God, then thistle-down before a
whirlwind, or a glasse-bottle before a Cannonshot.

Verse 19. God lays up his iniquity for his children] that is, the punishment
of his iniquity, whilst he visits the sins of the fathers upon the children
to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him, Exodus 20.5. Neither
does this contradict that of the Prophet Ezekiel, The son shall not dye for the
iniquity of his farher, chap. 18.17. Nor that of the Apostle, Every man shall
bear his own burden, Gal. 5.6. for the meaning of those worlds is, that no man
be damned for the sin of his father, nor one man for the sin of another,
unless by commission or approbation, or some way or other he make it his own.
But for temporal punishments there is none but (by occasion of others sins) may
have their portion in them: and wicked parents leave Jobs Legacy to their
children (see 2 Samuel 3.29.) yea though they prove to be good children, 1 King.
14.12, 13. for whom God lays up their parents iniquity in the treasures of
his justice to be produced in due time.

He rewards him.] For every transgression and disobedience; that is, every
Commission and Omission, receives a just recompense of reward, Heb 2.2. God
will abate him nothing.

And he shall know it.] Know it to his cost; Vexation shall give understanding:
he that before this judgment came, would know nothing of the bitter effect of
sin upon him and his, now has his eyes forced open (as the blind Mole is said
to have by the pangs of death) and cries out with the Lion in the snare, Si
prascivissem, Oh! if I had foreknown the mischief, etc. The wicked are wise too
late, the fool passes on, and is punished: he knows not the evil of sin, till
he feels it.

Verse 20. His eyes shall see his destruction.] His slaughter, says the Greek,
his breaking to pieces, says the Chaldee: this he shall see with his eyes, the
destruction of his person, and ruin of his Family. The sight of evil is a
grief to see, as well as the feeling of it is a pain: and that is complete
destruction which is not only felt but seen. Zedekiah first saw all his
children slain, and then had his eyes put out. Mauric^us had the like woeful
sight, and then was stewed in his own broth by the Traitor Ph^^as.

And he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.] Heb. The scalding hot wrath,
worse than that Cup of boiling Lead turned down the throat of a certain drunken
man, by the command of the Turkish Bashaw. Jerusalem drank wrath to
drunkenness, and had none to guide her; as a drunken man had need to have, Isa.
51.17. The Nations were to drink it to madness, Jer. 25.10. Babylons brats
shall drink of the wine of God's wrath, Rev. 14.10. (Poison in wine works more
furiously than in water) their irreparable ruin is set forth to the eye as it
were, when Rev. 18.21. an Angel, a mighty Angel takes a stone, a great stone,
even a millstone, which he casts and with impetuous force thrusts into the
bottom of the sea, whence it cannot be buoyed up. Now what is a mighty Angel to
the Almighty God, who has his, Name Shaddai, from destroying, as some are of
opinion?

Verse 21. For what pleasure has he in his house after him?] Hoc est, Omnia
impiorum, etiam post mortem eorum, maledicta erunt, says Brentius; All that
belongs to the wicked shall be accursed, even after their death, though some
are so desperately set upon wickeness, that they will have their swinge
whatsoever come of it, either to themselves, or their children after them. Sic
fere (...) sunt improbi, so unnatural they are many of them, (...) Sueton de
T^berio.
that, so they may satisfy their own sinful and sensual desires, let their
posterity sink or swim, let them shift as they can, they care not. Dives in
Hell seemed somewhat careful of his brethren; but self-love moved him to it:
for he knew well, that if they were damned, he should be double damned, because
they had sinned by his example and encouragement.

When the number of his months shall be cut off in the midst.] Mortis
periphrasis; that is, when he shall die, says one. But that is not all. Impius
moritur importune, The wicked dies in an ill time for himself; then when it
were better for him to do any thing, then to die. Many of them live not out
half their days, Psalm. 55.25. Eccles. 7.17. God cut off Elies two sons in one
day; and further threatened their father that there should not be an old man
left in his house for ever, 1 Samuel 2.32. Hezekiah, when he thought he should
die, complained that he had cut off his life like a Weaver, Esa. 38.12. who
cuts off the Web from the Thrum. But the Saints (such as he was) die not till
the best time, not till that time when, if they were rightly informed, they
would even desire to die.

Verse 22. Shall any teach God knowledge?] None but a presumptuous Fool will
take upon him to do that: such as was Alphonso the wise (the Fool rather) who
feared not to say openly, Roderic. sanct. H^st. Hispan. p. 4. chapter 5.
That if he had been of Gods Council at the Creation, some things should have
been better made, and marshalled. The wisest men are benighted in many things;
and what light soever they have, it is from the Father of Lights, whose
judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out: what a madness
were it therefore for any mortal to prescribe to the Almighty, or to define
whom, when, by what means, and in what measure he must punish offenders? Herein
Jobs friends took too much upon them; and he gives them the telling of it,
wishing them to be wise to Sobriety, and not to give Laws to God, who well
knows what he has to do, and how to order his earthly kingdom. To disallow
of his dealings, is to reach him knowledge; which is greatest sawciness.

Seeing he judges those that are high.] Excelsos in exc^lsis, the Angels, who
are so far above us in all manner of excellencies, and yet are ignorant of the
wisdom of Gods ways, which they know but in part; for how little a portion is
heard of him? Job 26.14. His judgments therefore are rather to be adored, than
pryed into: Mirarioportet, non rimari, let us rest contented with a learned
ignorance.

Verse 23. One dies in his full strength.] Iste moritur, There Is one dies in
his very perfections; or, in the strength of his perfection, when he is in the
Zenith, in the highest degree of earthly felicity: And he seems to point at
some one eminent wicked person, well known to them all. Confer Eccles. 9.2. God
is pleased to do wonderful contradictory things in man's reason: so that we must
needs confess an unsearchableness in his ways. In hoc opere, ratio humana
talpa magis caec^est, says Brentius; In this work of his, humane reason is
blinder then a Mole: Averroes turned Atheist upon it: and Aristotle was little
better, as being accused at Athens and banished into Chaelcis, quod de
divinitate male sentiret.

Being wholly at ease and quiet.] At ease in body and quiet in mind. The
common sort ask, What should ayle such a man? The Irish, What such an one
means to die?

Verse 24. His Breasts are full of milk, and his Bones, etc.] He is well lined
within, as we say, having abundance of good blood, and fresh spirits in his
body: fat and plump, and well liking. He is enclosed in his own fat, Psalm.
17.10. His back is well larded, and his bones are moistened with marrow; which
Plato says, Plat. in Tim^^.
is not only the sourse and seminary of generation, but the very seat of life.
Now such a state of body as is here described, is no defense at all against
death, says Job: Nay, it is a presage, and a forerunner of it many times. For
ultimus sanitatis gradus est morbo proximus, say Physicians; the highest degree
of health is nearest to sickness: We many times chop into the earth before we
are aware; like a man walking in a field covered with Snow, who falls into a
pit suddenly.

Verse 25. And another dies in the bitterness of his soul.] Heb. And this
dies with a bitter soul; in a sad and sorrowful condition: having suffered
many a little death all his life long, (as godly men especially use to do,
being destitute, afflicted, Heb. 11.
tormented, seldom without a cross on their backs) and then dies not only in
the sorrows of death, but in the sorrows of life, which to him has been a
liveless life, because a joyless life.

And never eats with pleasure.] Either because he has but Prisoners
pittance, which will neither keep him alive, nor suffer him to die. Or, if he
sit at a full table, yet his body is so ill affected by sickness, or his mind
with sorrow, that he finds no good relish in what he eats. That it is better
with any of us, see a mercy and be thankful.

Verse 26, They shall lie down alike in the dust; and worms, etc.] Death and
Afflictions are common to them both, as Eccles. 9. How then do ye pronounce me
wicked, because afflicted, and free among the dead, free of that company, etc?

And the worms shall cover them.] Who happily were once covered with costliest
clothing. The best are but worms-meat: why then should we pamper and trick up
these Carcasses, etc^

Verse 27. Behold I know your thoughts.] sc. By your words; as it is no hard
matter for a wise man to do, Prove. 20.5. for otherwise, God only knows the
heart, 1 Pet. 1.24. Psalm. 139.3. it is his royalty: But when men discover their
thoughts by their discourses, looks, gestures, etc. we may say as Job does
here, I know your thoughts; and that by the wicked wretch described by you, my
self is intended: this I am well aware of, though you hover in generals, and
speak in a third person. Lib. 1. (...), oblig.
Bartolus writes of Dr. Gabriel Nel^, that by the only motion of the Lips,
without any utterance, he understood any man's thoughts: The like some say they
can do by looks. The Italians have a proverb, That a man with his words close,
and his countenance loose, may travel undiscovered all the world over.

And the devices which you wonderfully imagine against me.] viz. To take away,
as it were by violence, my Credit and Comfort: this is the foulest theft; avoid
it.

Verse 28. For ye say, Where is the house of the Prince?] Ye say, though not in
so many words, yet upon the matter, Where is this man's (Jobs) princely pomp and
port, that but even now was so splendidous? A Prince they called Job in a jear,
Per ironi^m and antiphrafin. Va^ab.
and by contraries (says Vatablus,) because he had been rich, and should have
been liberal, and munificent, but had not been so. The Apostle calls the
Pharisees and Philosophers in like sort, Princes of this world, 1 Cor. 2.8.

And where are the dwelling places.] The Palaces, large and lofty, Junius.
ut sunt pratoria et principum aedes, as the houses of Princes use to be.
Lavater renders it, Taber^^cillum babitacul^t (...)
The Tabernacle of Tabernacles, as Gentlemen's houses amongst us are called,
Places, Halls, Courts. etc.

Of the Wicked?] viz. Of Job and his Children; the eldest sons especially,
which was blown down, chap. 1.18. As if it might not befall a good man also to
have his house plundered, burnt, his children brained, etc. They had often in
their discourses jerked at Jobs children.

Verse 29. Have ye not asked them that go by the way?] The cause of that their
rash judgment, Job shows here to be their ignorance of things known to every
ordinary passenger, and such as whereof there are many pregnant proofs and
Examples every where. Some by them that go by the way, understand men by
experience such as have gone many voyages, etc. made many observations in their
Travels of things remarkable: their notes are here called their tokens. By
those that go by the way, others understand Abraham the Hebrew (so he is
called, Genesis 14.13. that is, that Trans-Euphrataean; Or, He that passed over
the River Euphrates, when he passed by the way from Chaldea to Canaan) and his
Progeny Isaac and Jacob, who were passengers and pilgrims; and could tell by
experience, that men greatly afflicted may be yet favored of God, and in due
time delivered. Abraham had ten sore trials, and yet the friend of God. Isaak,
besides many other sharp afflictions all along his pilgrimage, was blind for
above twenty years before his death. Few and evil were the days of the years
of Jacob, his whole life almost one continuate affliction; and yet it was,
Jacob have I loved. Of all this, Job likely was not ignorant, and why should
his friends?

And do ye not know their tokens?] Or, Their tokens you shall not be estranged
from, Broughton thus; So ye would not make their signs strange. There will be
so much evidence of truth in what they say, that you will not be able to
gainsay it.

Verse 30. That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction] Here Is the
Passengers verdict; viz that wicked men shall escape scot-free, and flourish for
a season: nevertheless their preservation is but a reservation (as Pharaoh,
Sennacherib, and others have found it,) and if they flourish for the present,
it is that they may be destroyed for ever, Psalm. 92.7. Others read this verse
more suitably to the next, thus, That at the day of destruction the wicked is
kept back and they are carried out in the day of wrath; that is, they are often
spared whey the testimonies of Gods wrath are rife against others.

Verse 31. Who shall declare his way to his face; etc?] Who shall be so bold,
as to deal plainly with this rich wretch, and tell him his own? Divitibus ideo
deest amicus, qu^a nihildeest. Great men have many flatterers, and not a few
mutterers against them, but very few that will faithfully show them their sin,
and forewarn them of their danger, lest they meet with the same hard measure,
that the Hares in the Fable did, who taking upon them to reprove the Lion, were
torn in pieces by him for the same. Truth breeds hatred: and although she be
a good Mistress, yet they that follow her too close at heels, may hap to have
their teeth-struck out. But truth, downright truth, must be spoken, however it
be taken. Elias dealt roundly and impartially with wicked A^ab, Jeremy with
^^siah^s sons and successors, the Baptist with Herod. Christ with the Elders
and Pharisees, that noble General Tra^an, with Valens the Arian Emperor,
telling him, That by his persecuting the Orthodox, he had lost the day,
abandoning the Victory, and sending it away to the enemy.

And who shall repay him what he has done?] q.d. Men dare not, (for who will
take a Lion by the beard, or a Bear by the tooth?) God will not punish him
here, therefore he must needs escape unpunished. This is by Gregory fitly
referred to Antichrist, who may not be admonished, and will not be punished: but
thinks to bear out his most malap^rt misdemeanour, because it is -- facinus
majoris abolle, the fact of a great one.

Verse 32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave.] He that was erst so stern and
terrible, shall shortly be laid low enough, and then le^ni mortuo vel mus
insultabi^, Though he were such a son of Belial, that none could speak to him
(as Nabal was, 1 Samuel 25.17) yet death will speak with him, and confute this
proud haughty Scorner, that deals in proud wrath. Hist. of World.
When death comes (says Sir Walter Raleigh) which hates and destroys men,
that is believed and obeyed; But God, that loves and makes men, he is not
regarded. O mighty death! O eloquent death! whom none could advise, thou art
able to prevail with.

And shall remain in the Tomb] Heb. He shall watch over the heap, super tu^^lum
o^mul^ (...) in area constructo similem; as a Watchman, there he is fixed and
keeps this place. Lavat.
Or, He shall be watched in the Tomb.

Verse 33. The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him] Here he says the
same as before, but more poetically, and is variously rendered. The Vulgar
alluding to an old Poetical Fable, reads it thus. He shall he sweet to the
sand of Cocytus, which is fained to be one of the Rivers of Hell, or an
infernal Lake, so called from the moan there made by damned Ghosts, who should
be glad, of his arrival there. Hell from be ^^ath as ^^^ured for him to meet
him at his coming, as it is said of the Assyrian Tyrant, Isai. 14.9. Others
better expound it thus, He shall taste so much bitterness whiles he treads upon
the clods of the earth, that the clods under the earth shall be reckoned sweet
unto him. And Oh how well pleased would he be if he might forever lie hidden
there, and never rise up again to come to judgment! Caten. Grac.
And as it is with one wicked man departed, so it is with all other, whether
they dyed before, or shall dye after.

Verse 34. How then comfort ye me in vain?] Since ye apply nothing rightly to
me, nor affirm nothing rightly of me, but instead of comforting me, which you
came for, ye trouble me? And such are all those consolatiunculae creaturulae,
(as Luther finely phraseth it) petty-creature-comforts; waterish, and empty
businesses, an unsubstantial sustance, as one says of the bulrush.

Seeing in your answers remains false-hood.] Or, Provarication, or
double-dealing: foul mistakes, and little less then malice.

CHAP. XXII. Verse 1. Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said.]
ABruptly, without any Preface he sets upon Job; (as does likewise Bildad;
chap, 25.) acting the part of a spiteful Caviller, rather then of an ingenuous
Accuser; reckoning and ranking just Job among the wicked, not covertly, as
before, but overtly and expressly: and then thinking to salve all by an
exhortation to repentance, backed with a fair promise of a full restoration.
Pulcherrima pa^anesis, sed quid ad Johum, says Brentius? A very good
exhortation, but ill applied. We shall do well to take notice what a dangerous
thing it is to give way to unruly passions, which like heavy bodies down steep
hills, once in motion, move themselves, and know no ground but the bottom.

Verse 2 Can a man be profitable unto God?] No, neither does Job say he can but
the contrary, chap. 21.22. Howbeit the God of glory, (as he is called, Act.
7.2. although his glory is as himself, infinite and eternal, and therefore not
capable of our addition or detraction (the Sun would shine, though all the
would were blind;) yet to try how we prize his glory, and what we will do for
him, he has declared that he accounts himself made glorious by us, when we
get so far as to conceive of him above all creatures.

As he that is wise may be profitable to himself?] Or, But he that is wise.
etc. See Prove. 9.12. which Solomon seems to have taken hence. Natural reason
taught Plantus to bring in a Countryman animating his son cheerfully to
follow his business thus, Thou plowest, harrowest, sowest, and reapest for thy
self, Prudentiam selicit as fere sequitur. Isai. 52.13.
to thee shall this labor bring in joy. The word here rendered wise, sometimes
signifies prosperous, quod prudentibus omnia feliciter cedant, because prudent
persons do usually prosper.

Verse 3. Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art righteous?] Number
volup^ est Omnipotenti, etc? Is any thing added to his joy? Or needs he thy
manners and virtues to the making up of his perfection? Nothing less surely.
True it is, that he solliciteth suitors, John 4.23. and is well pleased with
our performances, Psalm. 51.6. But it is for our sakes, and to our benefit, and
not his own. Like as the Sun when he casts abroad his beams in the world,
seems to receive light from some other creatures; whereas in truth they all
receive light from him, and not he from them; so it is here: And as the same
Sun draws up vapors from the earth, not for it self, but to render them again
to the earth, to moisten and fatten it. So God, the true Sun of our souls,
draws from us our sighs and services, not for his own profit, but to rain
them down again upon us in so many blessings.

Verse 4. Will he reprove thee for fear of thee?] Does he plague and punish
thee thus, for fear that in time thou may grow so over-good, that he cannot
reward thee, or so overgreat, that he cannot command thee? No such marter.
Others read it thus: Would he reprove thee for thy Religion? Would he come into
judgment with thee? q.d. Vox timoris sive religionis active sumitur, etc.
Merlin. (...)
Surely God would not deal thus harshly with thee if thou did truly fear him:
But thou art a wicked wretch, as verse 5. Either God punishes thee for thy
piety or thy sinfulness. Not for the former, doubtless, (for piety is
profitable to all things, etc.) therefore for the latter. This is Eliphaz his
Argument here. Vel ad demonstrationem debitae miseriae, vel ad emendationem
labilis vitae vel ad exercitationem necessariae patientiae, etc.
But Austin makes answer (besides what Job does in the two following Chapters)
Fract. in Joan. 124. God chastises his best children sometimes for his own
glory, as John 9.3. sometimes for their good; as namely for prevention,
probation, purgation, preparation, either to the performance of some special
service; or to the receipt of some special blessing, etc.

Will he enter with thee into judgment?] This seems to be the same in sense
with the former Hemistich: and then it shows Eliphaz his confidence, though he
were in an error.

Verse 5. Is not thy wickedness great?] Why no: God of his grace had kept Job
innocent of the great transgression, Psalm. 19.13. and that wicked one had not
touched him: 1 John 5.18. Tactu qualitativo, Ca^etan.
scil. with a deadly couch; had not thrust his sting into him, or transformed
him into sins image. Had Eliphaz ever found Job to be such a one as here he
makes him? Or does he not by these interrogatories, cunningly come over him
(in kindness, as we say) to make him confess it? Had all been true that is
alleged, Jobs wickedness must needs have been great, and his iniquity
infinite. But to be accused is not enough to render a man guilty; for then who
should be innocent? Novit sapiens se ad hoc scamma productum, u^ depugnet cum^
i^s qui maledict is aluntur, ut venenis capreae. Cato was two and thirty times
accused, and as often absolved.

And thine iniquities infinite?] Heb. There is no end of thine iniquities: and
hence it is that thy miseries are so many and so long lasting; commernist^
tanta tuis sc^leribus. The wicked indeed are eternally tormented; 1. Because
being worthless, they cannot satisfy Gods Justice in any time: 2. Because
they have an infinite desire of sinning against God. Conjectura duntaxat, non
rei veritate nititur.
But neither of these could be truly affirmed of Job, That so grave a man as
Eliphaz. (whom the Jew-Doctors account a Prophet) should fall so foul upon his
innocent friend: and taking occasion by his great afflictions only, conjecture
and conclude him so heinous an Offender, cannot possibly be excused.

Verse 6. For thou have taken a pledge, etc.] Bona verba, quaeso, Eliphaz. How
well might Job have cried out, as David afterward did, Psalm. 35.11. False
witnesses rose up, they laid to my charge things that I knew not. Here he
stands accused, 1. Of inhumanitie and cruelty; 2. of Irreligion and Impiety.
But he fully clears himself of both, Ruffin. lib. 10. c. 15.
chap. 30. and 31. Athanasius in like sort was falsely accused of Adultery in
the Counsel of Tire, Anno 3.43. Eustathius Bishop of Entioch, was injuriously
deprived for the same cause, about the latter end of Constantine the Great.
Adultery, Acts and Mon.
Heresy and Treason were objected to Archbishop Cranmer. Parricide to Mr.
Philpot, Sedition to Father Latimer; to which he answers. As for Sedition,
for ought that I know, me thinks I should not need Christ, if I might so say.

For nought] Or, unconscionably, as one renders it: and herein lay the fault.
See Deuteronomy. 24.6, 10.

And stripped the naked of their cloathing] If naked, how could he strip them,
hilde them, as the word signifies? Chrysostom uses this Proverb, Nudus nec a
c^^tum viris spoiliatur, He that is naked cannot be stripped by an hundred men.
We also have a Proverb, Where nothing can be had the King must lose his right.
And again, He is like to get little
Who robs a Spittle.


In the late Germane Wars, the Crabats, at Altroff an University, plundered the
Scholars, Life of the King of Sweden.
and put poor Genus and Species to their Ransom. Micah inveyeth against such
Canibal Princes, as plucked the skin from the flesh, and the flesh from the
bones of the poor oppressed, chap. 3.2, 3. See the Note there. That which
Eliphaz here charge Job with, but without truth, is that he script off the
clothing of the naked; that is, that finding them poor enough, he left them
yet poorer: hardly having a rag to hang on their backs, through his extortion.

Verse 7. Thou have not given water to the weary to drink] But have slain him
with thirst; when thou might have saved him with a cup of cold water. Qui
non, cum potest, servat, occidit: Not to do good (when it is in the power of a
man's hand) is to do evil; and not to save a life is to destroy it, Mark. 3.4.
Not robbing only, but not relieving of the beggar, was the rich man's ruin,
Luke 16. who for a cup of cold water, duly given, might have had heaven,
Matthew. 10.42. But, what meant Eliphaz to charge innocent and munificent Job
with such a cruelty? 1 The man was angry; and Imp^dit ira animum ne possit
cernere verum. Horat.
2: He seems not directly to charge him with these crimes; Necesse est, ut
fatcaris t^ aut hoc, aut illud, aut omnia commifisse, etc. Junius.
but to urge him to consider and confess, that he could not be but a grievous
sinner, who was so great a sufferer. Surely God would never handle thee so
hardly, unless thou were deeply guilty of these or the like enormities.

Thou have withheld Bread from the hungry.] Bread thou had enough and to
spare: but, like a greedy-gut Pamphagus, thou would part with none, though it
were to save the life, not of thine enemy (which yet thou should have done,
Prove. 25.21. Elisha feasted his Persecutors, 2 Kings 6. Isaac his wrong-doers,
Genesis 26.39. by a noble revenge) but of thy fellow-friend and brother by race,
place, and grace. Thou have hidden thine eyes from thine own flesh, when thou
should have dealt thy Bread to the hungry, Esa. 58.7. Yea, drawn, out thy
soul (and not thy sheafe only) famelic^, to the hunger-starved, and satisfied
the afflicted soul, verse. 10.

Verse 8. But as for the mighty man, he had the Earth.] Heb. But as for the man
of Arm, he had the Land. This the vulgar applies to Job: as if by his power he
had wrought all others out, and seated himself alone in the Land; Pauperes non
dignaris pane: at potentibu^ possessiones (...) offers, etc. Vatab.
suffering none to dwell by him, but those that he could not over-match. Others
by the mighty man understand the strong and wealthy; who are said to be
gracious with Job, sharing with him in his Possessions, and partaking of his
Privileges, when the poor were slighted and could not have Justice, much less
Mercy. Here then Eliphaz accuses Job of Pride and Partiality.

And the honorable man dwel^ in it.] Heb. Eminent, or accepted for countenance:
that is, he who came commended by his wealth, friends, great alliances,
honors, etc. was in great request with Job, and might easily carry any cause
with him. Hac sunt peccate gravissima, quae non reputant homines, says
Vatablus, These are very great sins, though men little think of it.

Verse 9. Thou have sont Widows away empty.] A Widow is a calamitous name,
Vi^u^ (...) et de^elict^ nihil est humiliu^: ex p^oinde peculiariter viduarum
^udex et vindex est Deus. Bain. in Prove. 15.
2 Samuel 14.5. I am indeed a Widow-woman and my Husband is dead. As a Tree whose
root is uncovered thriveth not: so it fares with a widow. R. Jon^ observes,
That in Hebrew she has her name from dumbness, quod m^rit^ mortuo respondere
non possit adversariis, et se adversus eos tueri, because now that her Husband
is dead, she cannot answer her adversaries, or defend her self against them.
God therefore has taken them and their Orphans into his tuition, owning them
as his Clients, and commanding all men to be good to them. These if Job had
indeed sent away empty, not only not releiving their necessities, but ravishing
their estates, adding the misery of poverty to that of their condition, he had
surely subjected himself to the feirce wrath of God, their P^tro^ by a
specialty.

And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.] Immanis injuria, si ita res
haberet, sed calumnia erat, says Mercer. This had been a crying crime, if it
could have been proved against Job; but he was not the man: Some from these
words conclude him a Judge; others a King. Doubtless he was a porent person,
and by his greatness could have borne out his soulest outrages, breaking
through the lattice of the Laws, as the bigger Flies do through a Spider-web.
Sed alia de se infra profi^^bi^ur, says Mercer here: But Job shall clear
himself in the following Chapters: where we shall find him described and
charactered to have been the Oracle of Wisdom, the Guardian of Justice, the
Refuge of Innocence, the comet of the Guilty, the patron of Peace, and pattern
of Piety, to Magistrates especially, in the wise managing of all public
Affairs, both of Judgment and Mercy.

Verse 10. Therefore snares are round about thee.] Flagitium and flagellum sunt
sicut acus et filam. Sin and Punishment are tied together with chains of
Adamant. Eliphaz having with more earnestness than truth set forth Jobs sins,
now discourses of his snares. Four punishments he assures him of, and every
one worse than other. 1. He shall be Ensnared. 2. Frighted. 3. Benighted. 4.
Overwhelmed, if Repentance step not in and take up the matter, as verse 22. And
it is as if he should say, Seek not after any other cause of thy Calamities than
thy forementioned wickednesses: neither seek any other way to get off, than by
confessing and forsaking them, that thou may have mercy.

And sudden fear troubles thee:] Fear is a troublesome Passion: and sudden
evils are very terrible, because they expectorate a man's abilities, and render
him helpless, shiftless, comfortless. See this in Saul, who surprised with
sudden horror at his destiny read him by the Devil, fell straightway all along
on the earth like an Ox, and was sore afraid, and there was no strength in him,
1 Samuel 28.20. Job also had his fears, but then he had his cordials too, that
kept him from falling under them.

Verse 11. Or darkness, that thou can not see.] Sunt tenebrae supplicia, et
damnatorum desperationes, says Brentius here; By darkness are meant
punishments temporal, and eternal. Others understand the text of blindness and
confusion of mind, that can neither see the cause of trouble, nor find an
issue.

And abundance of waters cover thee] So that although thou should escape the
snares, outlive the fears, run away in the dark, yet how will thou avoid the
Deluge of Destruction, the overflowing scourge that carries all before it?

Verse 12. Is not God in the height of Heaven?] Some add out of the next
verse, these words, Say thou; making Jobs Atheistical speeches (here
mimetically fathered upon him by Eliphaz) an argument of his great wickedness;
as if Job should say, and so discover himself (for out of the abundance of the
heart the mouth speaks, Matthew. De Dii^, utrum sint, non ausim affirmare. Prot.
12.) to be of Protagoras his opinion, who doubted of a Deity: Or of Diagoras
his, who flatly denied it: Or at least of Aristotle's, who pent up God in
heaven; and taught that he took little or no care of things done on earth. But
what says the Psalmist? (and Job was of the same mind, whatever the
Jew-Doctors affirm of him to the contrary,) Psalm. 115.3. Psalm. 113.4, 5, 6, 7.
Our God is in the Heavens: he has done whatsoever he pleased in heaven and in
earth. The Lord is high above all Nations: and his glory above the Heavens. Who
is like unto the Lord our God, who dwells on high: who humbles himself to
behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth? He raises up the poor
out of the dust, 2 Chronicles, 16.9.
etc. The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth to show
himself strong, Romans 1.18.
etc. His wrath is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
unrighteousness of men. Job had frequently acknowledged and celebrated the
power and providence of God, his judgments upon the wicked, his fatherly
chastisements upon himself; deeply detesting all such thoughts and speeches as
he is here wrongfully made the Author of.

And behold the height of the Stars.] Heb. The head of the stars; those that
are the very highest, and at the top of the visible heaven, the eighth heaven,
beyond which some of the Ancients acknowledged not any other. Aristotle says,
That beyond the aspectable and moveable heavens, Decoel. Text. 99.
there is neither body, nor time, nor place, nor vacuum. But the scripture
teaches us, That there is beyond the Stars (how high set soever) a third
heaven, a heaven of heavens, the Throne of God, and habitation of the Blessed:
The starry sky is but as the brick-wall encompassing this lofty Palace, the
glorious and glittering rough-cast thereof.

How high they are.] Vt vix ^o noster possit aspectus pertingere, so high that
our eyes can hardly reach them. Mercer.
It is a wonder, that we can look up to so admirable a height, and that the
very eye is not tired in the way. Now God is far, far above the stars, omnium
supremus, altissimorum altiss^mus, The high and lofty One that inhabiteth
Eternity, Propterea quod tantum Chaos sit in^er nos et De^^^. Vat.
Isa. 57.17. dwells in light inaccessible, 1 Timothy 6.16. such as whereof no
natural knowledge can be had, nor any help by humane Arts, Geometry, Optics,
etc. How then can he see from such a distance what is here done on earth, says
the Atheist? who thinks to hide himself from God, because he has hidden God
from himself? Hear him else in the next verse. See also Ezekiel. 8.12. and 9.9.

Verse 13. And thou say, How does God know?] A brutish question, Psalm.
94.7, 8. and never of Jobs making. There are a fort of such miscreants as
believe nothing but what they see with their bodily eyes: and indeed, for a
finite creature to believe the infinite Attributes of God, he is not able to do
it thoroughly, without supernatural grace; which therefore must be begged of
God, Jam. 1.5. that he would give us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
knowledge of him, the eyes of our understanding being enlightened, etc. Ephesians.
1.17, 18. For want whereof, the wicked, blinded with sin, ask such senseless
and blasphemous questions as this in the text, and those like this, Psalm.
10.11. Zeph. 1.12. See the Note there. Plin. 1.2. c. 7.
It is a ridiculous thing, says Pliny, to think that the highest Majesty
takes care of humane affairs, a service (doubtless) far below him, and
unworthy of his greatness.

Can he judge through the dark cloud?] Can he discern through such a dark
medium? Sicut pueri vultum obvelant, putantes sese tum non conspici. Lavat.
Men cannot see God; and therefore some fools are apt to think that neither can
he see them. But that Job was far from any such thought, see chap. 21.16.22. To
blame therefore was Eliphaz to charge him with such a wickedness: and all
because he had said, that in this life bad men often prosper, and better men
suffer, which yet is verum tanquam ex tripode, very true; and not at all
derogatory to the divine providence.

Verse 14. Thick clouds are a covering to him.] He lies close hid among the
clouds, and sees nothing. But be the clouds never so thick, Christ's eyes are
a flaming fire, Rev. 1.14. And the School of Nature teaches, That the fiery
eye needs no outward light, but seech extra-mittendo, by sending out a ray,
etc. He will freely blot out the sins of his people as a cloud, and their
transgressions as a thick cloud, Esa. 44.22. and 43.25. but the clouds cannot
hinder him from sight of their sins; for he is All-eye: and darkness and light
are both alike to him, Psalm. 139.12. (...).
A cloud may come between the body of the Sun and us: and the whole. Hemisphere
may be masked and over-cast as we call it, but nothing can keep God from eying
and ordering all things.

And he walk h in the circuit of heaven.] Where it seems thou think he
only manageth matters and bears rule, and not below. So indeed the
Peripateticks thought, and taught. Agreeably whereunto Lysippus made Alexanders
picture looking up to heaven, with this Posie, Juppiter, asserui terram mihi,
tu assere coelum.

With which picture Alexander was so delighted, Plin. l. 6. c. 16.
that he proclaimed that none should take his picture but Lysippus.

Augustus also heard with delight, Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet.
Virgil. vita.


And the Great Turk, vexed at his great loss in the last Assault of Scodra,
most horribly blasphemed against God, saying, Turk. Hist. fol, 423.
That it were enough for him to have care of heavenly things, and not to cross
him in his worldly actions. The Atheist here takes it for granted, That God
has enough to do to walk from place to place in Heaven, (as Princes do in
their Progress) and to order those heavenly bodies how they shall affect these
lower bodies, by their light, heat, and influence, etc. Fain they would confine
him to that circuit or circle (the heavens are supposed to be sphaerical and
circular) that he might meddle no further. Fain they would persuade themselves
and others, That God has cast off the care of earthly business, and committed
all to Fate and Fortune: that many might live far more comfortable, if they
were less conscientious: that it dothing concerns God, whether men do or not
do this or that, etc. Such dust-heap^s as these may be easily found in every
corner; for all places are full of them, and so is hell too. As for Job, the
Counsel of these wicked ones was far from him, chap. 21.16. he was the worse to
think of them: whatever Eliphaz (by mistake of his meaning at the least)
thought of him.

Verse 15. Have thou marked the old way?] Heb. The way of old. Broughton
renders it, the way of the old world: of those ungodly ones before the Flood.
Hereby it appears, say our Learned Annotatours, that Job lived before the
deliverance out of Egypt, because he mentions the Creation and the Flood, but
not that deliverance; which had he known, it would have affo^ded him an
excellent Argument to prove that godly men might be in great afflict on, as the
Israelites were in Egypt; and his friends a plausible argument that God uses
to destroy wicked men for their sin, as he did the Egyptians in the red sea.

Which wicked men have trodden.] Heb. Mortals of iniquity, or vanity. Viri
nequam and nequaquam, vel nibili; Men of wickedness with a witness. The face
of the old world was grown so foul, that God was fain to wash it with a flood.
All was out of order in family, State and Church. In the Family was found
Luxury, and unlawful Marriages. In the State, Tyranny, violence, rapacity and
injustice. In the Church, contempt of Gods Word, and a fond opinion that God
did not order all by his Providence. but that a man might do well enough
without him. Now that this was the Opinion of those Antediluvian Belialists,
some have gathered from this Text, which they read thus, Will thou follow the
old way; that is, the Tenet of those old sinners against their own souls, whom
God for their damnable security and licentiousness (the products of such a
portentous opinion) buried all together in one universal grave of waters?

Verse 16. Intempesta morte abrepti. Jun.
Which were cut down out of time] Or, Which grew full of wrinkles (as those
that have long lien in the water are apt to do) and not time; that is, before
that time of life that they had promised themselves on earth; or before they
had fulfilled the days of their forefathers, who though wicked above measure
many of them, yet the flood could not come, till Methuselah (the last liver of
the ten Patriarks) were laid up. God cuts off some notoriously wicked betime,
when in the course of Nature they might have lived longer, that they may do no
more hurt, as the Gardener destroys young Henbane, and the Country man young
Vermins.

Whose foundation was overflown with a flood] Heb. A river was powered upon
their foundation. This some understand of that River of Brimstone and fire
powered from heaven upon Sodom and her sisters: But better take it of those in
Noah's days, whose foundation (that is, the earth, that foundation of mankind:
or their wealth and prosperity, whereon they thought themselves firmly
founded, or their lives, etc.) were everslowne with a flood; which came rushing
in upon them with mighty force, and drowned the Universe. And here the Hebrews
make to be the middle of this Book of Job, wherein they reckon in all One
thousand and seventy verses.

Verse 17. Which said unto God, Depart from us] Atheists, those Antediluvians
were; if not Dogmatical, yet practical, such as Job had described, speaking the
like language of hell, chap. 21.14. Et maliciose eum Eliphazus talium atheorum
numero accenset, says Mercer, And maliciously does Eliphaz reckon Job among
those odious Atheists, so thinking to cut his throat with his own sword, and
confute him with his own words. Malice cares not how truly things are set
forth, so it may gall or kill.

And what can the Almighty do for them?] that is, They asked, what can the
Almighty do for them? As if God neither could nor would reward their services:
as if he would do them neither good nor evil. The Seventy render it, (...) What
will he bring upon us? q.d. He threatens us with a flood, but when trow, and
how? Let the day of the Lord come? Isai. 5 19. Where is the promise of his
coming, etc? 2 Pet 2. Thus they jeered when it was fitter they should have
feared? but what was the issue?

Verse 18 Yet he filled their houses with good things] Heb. With good; that is,
with all precious and pleasant riches, whereof he gave them both plenty and
propriety, but no otherwise then as Joseph caused his cup to he conveyed into
Benjamins sack the better to furnish out an Indictment against him. And as
Benjamins pretended theft was held more heinous, by how much his welcome was
the greater, for he had a five-fold portion: so shall it one day fare with such
rich wretches, as whose bellies God fills with his hid treasure, and whose
houses he fills top full with good things. -- Eutrapelus cuicunque nocere
volebat.
Vestiment a d^bat pretiosa -- Horat.

Well might Eliphaz add, all things reckoned.

But (or yet) the counsel of the wicked is (or be it) far from me] See these
words expounded, chap 21.16. where Job has the very same. Sed ea vult illi
eripere Eliphaz. says a learned Interpreter. But Eliphaz will needs take them
away from him: and it is as if he should say, Thou, O Job, seem by thy
words, and with thy mouth to detest the counsel of the wicked; but thy doings
declare the contrary. Whilst thou so many ways celebratest the prosperity of
the ungodly. To me therefore, and to all righteous men, who do heartily hare
the wicked, and do seriously set forth Gods just judgments against them, does
this speech better agree, and more truly appertain, etc. And as for these
righteous men, let me tell thee further,

Verse 19. The righteous see it, and are glad] And as for my self, The counsel
of the wicked is far from me: I do therefore abominate their present
prosperity, because they shall shortly be for a laughing stock to all good men:
The upright shall see it and be glad, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth, as
self-condemned, and therefore by the Saints (swallowed up with a zeal of Gods
glory) rightly derided, Psalm. 52 6. and 58.11.

And the Innocent laugh them to scorn] Not out of ill will, or envy, or other
corrupt affection: But 1. For the glory of God, whose Power, Justice and
Goodness is hereby evinced and evidenced. 2. For the good of others, who
stumble at the prosperity of the ungodly, or else are eased of their cruelty.
3. And hereunto, That it is never the worse for the wicked themselves, that God
takes them off. For if they be Elect, they repent ere they dye: as if
Reprobates, they are kept hereby from adding to their sin, and so to their
torments, which shall be proportionable thereunto. Those that understand this
verse of Noah and his sons, rejoicing when they saw the rest drowned, and
themselves preserved, render the words thus, The righteous saw it and were
glad, and the innocent laughed them to scorn. A late reverend man of God
amongst us, Mr. Jeremy Dyke p 183.
in a Discourse of his about the benefit of a good conscience in times of
common calamity, brings in Noah and those with him in the Ark, insulting over
the perishing old world thus: Now Jubal let us hear one of your merry songs,
pipe now, and make your self merry, as you were wont in gybing at Noah's folly
in making a Ship to sail on dry land. What ailest thou Jubal, to howl and
wring thine hands thus? Where is thy Harp and Organs now? Now the flood is
come, now Noah is in his Cabin, and the water begins to be chin-deep, tell me,
O Jubal, whether building of Tents, or building of an Ark be the wiser work?
Would you not give all the shoes in your shop, all the tools in your tents,
all the cattle in your flocks, to be but where Noah's dog lies? And now Sirs,
you that were such men of Renown, Genesis 6.4. you that were the brave Gallants of
the earth, now tell me who is the fool, and who is the wise man now. Thus he.
Piscator takes the next verse, Where as (or, though) our substance is not cut
down, but (or, yet) the remnant of them the fire consumes, to be spoken in the
person of Noah, whom he makes the innocent man here mentioned; and adds,
Saying, in the beginning of the next verse; As if Noah coming out of the Ark
should wash his feet in the blood of those wicked; and say. God has preserved
me and mine, (our sincerity has prevailed for our safety) and in his wrath
destroyed the ungodly. But I rather concur with Tremellius, and Merlin, and
others, who make this verse coherent with, and preparatory to the following
famous Exhortation to Repentance, Verse 21, 22, 23, etc. Acquaint thy self now
with him, and be at peace, etc. But be sure thou do it now, that is speedily
and timously.

Verse 20. When as our substance is not cut down] that is, Whiles life lasts,
and whiles it is called to day; before death comes: and after death,
judgment: when the remnant of the wicked fire shall consume. Where we have a
forcible motive to repent, because we must either ^urn or burn, Aut
poenitendum, aut pereundum, See Acts 17.31. 2 Cor. 5.10, 11. Heb. 12.28, 29.
Eliphaz seems here on purpose to have mentioned that fire wherewith wicked
men shall be tormented at the last day, and before (for every man's deaths-day
is his doom-day) and to have changed the person.

The remnant (or excellency) of them the fire consumeth] That it might the more
effectually move men to repent, that they may be delivered from the wrath to
come. And here I could willingly take up Chrysostomes wish, Vtinam ubique de
Gehenna dissereretur! Oh that men would talk more every where of hell fire
unquenchable, intolerable, and the fuel thereof made of the most tormenting
temper, Isai. 30.33. It was a speech of Gregory Nyssen, He that does but hear
of hell, is without any further labor or study taken off from sinful
pleasures, and set upon the practice of mortification. But men's hearts are
grown harder now adays, and he that shall observe their impiety and
impenitency, may well say to them, as Cato once did to Caesar, Credo quae de
inferis dicuntur falsa existimas, I believe thou think all but a fable that
is said concerning hell.

Esse aliquos Manes, etc.
Nec pueri credunt nisi qui nondum aere lavantur. Juven. Sat. 2.

Verse 21. Acquaint now thy self with him] Accommoda (...) nune illi^ ass^esce
cum illo. Converse with God in an humble familiarity; set him at the right
hand, Psalm 16.8. be ever at his hand, Vt famulus son accensus, as Attendant
upon his person. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and let him direct thy
paths, Prove. 3.6. Ask counsel at his mouth, aim at his glory, be thou in his
fear all the day long, Prove. 23.17. Account it thine happiness to be in
communion with him, and conformity to him, in all parts and points of duty. The
Lord is with you, if you be with him, 2 Chronicles. 15.3.

And be at peace,] Return to him by repentance, from whom thou have so deeply
revolted, and against whom thou have so shamefully rebelled. For Eliphaz here
takes it for granted, Acquiesce ei.
that Job had estranged himself from God, and therefore could not possibly be
at peace till better acquainted with him, and acquiescing in him, as the Vulgar
here has it. No creature is more fearful then a fish, flying at the shadow of
a man; yet it fears not the roaring Ocean, (which yet Lions, and other fierce
creatures fear) because it is of its own nature and acquaintance. A sheep
fears not his shepherd; nor shall we God, if once acquainted with him: Pe^^e
shall be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy Tabernacles.

Thereby good shall come unto thee] Happy shall thou be, and it shall be well
with thee, Psalm. 128.2. A Coruncopia, a confluence of all manner of comforts
and contentments shall betide thee: but then thou must humble thy self to walk
with thy God, Mi^. 6.8. by faith walk with God, and by reflection walk with thy
self: Compone, and emenda vias tu^^ coram Domino, and then thou need not
say with the worldling, Who will show us any good? Psalm. 4.6. for God himself
will say unto thee, as once he did to Moses, when he gave him but a glimpse of
himself and his glory, Ostendam tibiomne bonum, I will make all my goodness
pass before thee, Ex^d. 33.19.

Verse 22, Receive, I pray thee, the Law from his mouth] Now he speaks Job
fair, whom before he had sufficiently rippled up, and rough-hewed, without
mercy, or so much as truth. That which he here persuades him to, is to depend
upon God for direction and success in all his enterprises: to consult with him
upon all occasions, and not to do ought without his warranty and approbation.
Gods testimonies were David's delight, and his Counselors, Psalm 119.24. All
that advise not with these, must needs be without understanding, a Nation void
of counsel, Deuteronomy. 32.28.

And lay up his words in thine heart.] Heb. Put his word, as the Tables were
put in the Ark; mingle Gods Word with faith in thine heart, as in a vessel: Cor
autem sit carnen^ fide; the flinty heart is made flashly by faith, and capable
of divine impressions.

Verse 23. If thou return to the Almighty, thou shall be built up.] By sin men
run from God, by repentance they return to him. Break off thy sins by
repentance, and put away iniquity far from thy Tabernacle (for iniquity and
repentance cannot cohabit, and he is no true Penitentiary, that reformeth not
his family, that sets not up God, wherever he has to do) so shall thou be
built up; that is, thou shall be restored, and all thy losses in wealth and
Children shall be made up again: prorsus erigeris qui ^am collapsus es: thou,
who art now down on all four, shall be new set up, and made to stand in thy
former strength. Only thou must return usque ad Om^potentem, all out as far as
to the Almighty, thou must not give the half-turn only as hypocrites do, but
with thy whole heart; and as Joel 2.12. see the Note there. Thus Eliphaz
discourses very well, and handsomely of the business in hand: Only he was out
in this, That he looked upon Job as an impenitent person, and upon his family
as ill-ordered, As also, in that he conceived that true repentance is ever
rewarded with outward and inward prosperity: whereas a penitent person may
continue under crosses, though God will surely save the humble, as he says
afterward, verse 29. and, repentance can turn crosses into comforts: and like
the Philosophers stone, make golden afflictions, 1 Pet. 1.7. As scarlet pulls
out the teeth of a Serpent, so this takes away the sting of a judgment. As
wine draws a nourishing virtue from the flesh of Vipers, etc.

Verse 24. Then shall thou lay up gold as dust] Which is as much as to say
(says One) thou shall make pavements of gold; see 2 Chronicles. 1.15. Psalm. 68.30.
Then shall thou have thy desire; for thou shall be rich with content, which is
worth a million, as another paraphraseth it. Beza renders it thus, Cast thy
gold on the ground, (even that worldly pelf, whereto thou have been wholly
addicted) and let the gold of Op^ir beunt thee as the peeble-stonts of the
brooks, (make no more account of it than of those small stones) and let the
Almighty be thy tower, let him be unto thee as plenty of silver. The Spaniards
are said to have found in the Mines of America, more Gold than Earth. Perhaps
Eliphaz here promises Job, that upon his return to God, his Land should have
many rich veins of Gold: And so One paraphraseth this text thus; Then shall
you acquit your self of all your losses, Senault.
and you shall recover with usury what was taken from you: for, for barren
lands which could being forth nothing, you shall have such as in their intrails
shall produce Porphyry: and in stead of those unprofitable Rocks which made a
part of your Estate, you shall have fertile Mines, from whence shall issue
Rivers of Gold. Agreeable whereunto is that Exposition of Bren^ius, Repo^^etur
pro pul^er^ aurum, pro vili preciosum^ pro fluv^is ar^nam trabentibus,
terrentes a^eis lapillis impleti; Thou shall have for Dust Gold: for vile
things those that are precious: for sandy rivers, golden torrents. An
byperbolical expression.

And the Gold of Ophir.] Where the best Gold grew: possibly the same with Peru,
the letters only transposed. Ophir, Genesis 10. was one of the sons of ^oktan, who
came of Shem, from whom, says Josephus, a Country in India abounding with
Gold, had its name. Him aurum obrizune dictum, quase Ophirizum: Ophir, is here
put for the Gold of Ophir: for the word Gold is not in the original.

Verse 25. Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense.] Or, thy Gold, for the same
word signifies both: chap. 36.19. because Gold is the worldly man's defense,
Prove. 18.11. though but a ^o^^y one, Zeph. 1.18. Prove. 11.4. Ezekiel. 7.19. It is
as if he should say, Either thou shall have gold Gods plenty; or else, then
shall have that which is better than gold, viz. God the Maker and Master of all
the world, says (...), who renders the (...); And the Almighty: shall be thy
choicest gold, and silver, and strenght to (...) He shall be all that heart can
wish, or need require. A friend of Cyrus, in ^eno p^on, being asked where him
Treasure was? Answered, (...) Where Cyrus is my friend: Let us answer, (...)
Where God is my friend. When David had said, The Lord is my portion, he
subjoyned in the next verse, The (...) pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
heritage, Psalm. 10.5, 6. When God had said to Abraham, Law thy s^^i^^, he
easily slighted the King of Sol^o^^^ith offers.

And whom (...) have (...)] Heb. Silver of strengths, or of heights (...) that
is, at the rulgar interp^epe^h it; (...) coacer^abit^^ tibi; thou shall have
high heapt of silver, store of money (...) has the promises of both lives: and
if godly men are not (...), it is, that godliness may he adtmired for it self?
And they must know^ (...) in remporals, shall be made up in spirituals;
according to (...) which folleweth.

Verse 26. For then shall thou have thy delight in the Almighty.] As in thine
only Portion. Thou shall enjoy him which is the top of humane happiness:
solace thy self in the fruition of him, ta^^e and see how good the Lord is, and
thereupon love him dearly, Psalm. 18.1. not only with a love of desire, as Psalm.
42.1, 2. but of complacency, as Psalm. 73.25, 26. affecting not only an union,
but an unity with him: and conversing with him, as we may, in the mean while,
in a fruitful and cheerful use of his holy Ordinances.

And shall lift up thy face unto God.] Wrapping thy self in Christ's
righteousness, thou shall draw nigh to God with an humble boldness in duty, and
not doubt but he will draw nigh to thee in mercy. Melch. Ad. in vita.
It is said of Luther, that he prayed with so great reverence as unto God; and
yet with so great confidence, as to his friend.

Verse 27. Then shall make thy prayer unto him, and he shall he^r thee.] Yea,
though thou multiply prayer and intorcession for thy self and others (as the
word signifies, Multiplicabis verba tua. Mer.
and as afterward Job did for Eliphaz and his fellows, or else it bad gone
worse with them) yet he shall hear thee in all: Thou shall as his favorite,
have the royalty of his ear, and he shall say unto thee seriously as Z^^^kiah
did once to his Courtiers soothingly, The King can deny you nothing. Iste viz
potuit ap^d D^um quod ^oluit, said One concerning Luther, That man could have
of God whatsoever he lifted. This David took (as well he might) for a singular
mercy, Psalm. 13. ult. Psalm. 66. ult.

And thou shall pay thy vows.] i.e. Thou shall return thy thanks, and so shall
drive an holy trade, as it were, betwixt heaven and earth. Nulla tibi a Deo
nisi gratias agendi accasio dabitur. Thou shall have unmiscarrying returns of
thy suits; so that thou must be ready with thy praises ^^ter their prayers; for
that is all thou shall have to do. Psalm. 65.1, 2.
Praise wai^^th for thee, O God, in Zion; and unto thee shall all the vow be
performed. O thou that heavest prayers, note thee shall all flash come, with
their thanks in their hands as it were.

Verse 28. Thou shall also de^^es a thing and it shall be established unto
thee.] God will be better to thee than thy Prayers: and prosper all thy
Counsels, effect thy designs. The ungodly are not so, as is to be seen in
those revolted Israelites, Judge. 2. in King Saul, and in our King Jobs. O^ if
they have their designs, it is for a further mischief to them: As, if the
godly he crossed, it is in mercy: like as it is storied of our Queen Isabel,
that being to repass from Z^land into Eagland with an Army, they has (...)
been utterly cast away, had she (...) being there expected by her enemies. But
providence, against her will, brought her to another pla^^, Mr. Clark in his
Life p. 262.
where she safely (...). The like is reported of Bishop Jo^el, that being
sought for by the Popish Persecutors, he had been caught, but that going to
London, he ^^st his way.

And the light shall (...) upon thy wa^^] That is to say, God will inspire thee
with good counsel and direction in all thine affairs; Diod.
and turn thin^ ill counsels into good unto thee (as the Heathens thought
Minerva did to her Athenians, and as the Romans fancied of their God ^es^
Vibilia, that she set them in their right way when they were wandering) or will
shine over them with his blessing, contrary to thy complaint, chap. 19.8.

this, and the following verse, (...) and (...) upon (...) they be (...) and
18.24. And hence Jobs intercession (...)

And he shall save the humble person.] Heb. Him that is low of eyes, as was Job
at this time and the Publican, Luke 18.13. An high look, and a proud heart go
together, Psalm. 101.5. And as God resists such, Jam. 4.4. 1 Pet. 5.5. so he
gives grace to the humble; and not grace only, but glory too; as here; safety
here, and salvation hereafter.

Verse 30. He shall deliver the Island of the innocent.] Or. He shall deliver
the not innocent; him that i^ not guiltless: and even such shall be delivered
for the purity of thine handi. Thus God gave Z^ar to Lot, and all the souls in
the ship to Paul, and the guilty Israelites to Moses. See Jer. 5.1. Or, the
innocent shall deliver the Island: Or, Liberabitur v^ innocentis, The innocent
shall be freed from affliction: so Brentius.

And it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.] i. Of thy works, or by
the pure hands listed up in Prayer. Semen sanctum statu^^^ terra, the Saints
bear up the state, Isa. 6.13. they uphold the pillars of the earth by their
Piety and Prayers: and therefore when God is unchangeably resolved to ruin a
people, he silenceth his Saints, as Jer. 7.16. or removes them out of the
world; as he did Methuselah the year before the Flood. And as one Sinner may
destroy much good, Eccl. 9.18. So one Praying Saint may save an Island, a whole
Country: it is delivered by the pureness of thy hands. It may be, the work
sticks at thee: why then is not thy shoulder at the wheel, when the cart is
stalled?

CHAP. XXIII. Verse 1. Then Job answered and said.]
Fiz. IN defense of his own integrity, (...) Plat.
against Eliphaz his calumnies in the foregoing Chapter. To make Apology to
every one that shall traduce us, ^lat^ holds to be both base and Bootlesse.
But when such a weighty man as Eliphaz shell say load upon so innocent a man as
Job, Qu^^ t^lerit? something would be said in way of answer.

Verse 2. Even to day is my complaint bitter] q.d. After all mine endeavoar to
satisfy you, I am still mis-interpreted, and accounted by you my friends no
better then a Malecontent and a Murmu^er against God; albeit my laments do no
way equal my torments. True it is, that Eliphaz had given him excellent
counsel, chap. 22.21.22. etc. but it was to flatter him into the same error
that himself held; viz. that bodily and temporal sufferings are a sure sign of
a notorious hypocrite. Hence Job never takes notice of it in this reply: but
begins his Apology pathetically and abruptly; and soon falls into an appease to
God the righteous Judge, who well knew, (though his friends would take no notice
of it) that he complained not without cause^ but the contrary.

My stroke is heavier thou my groaning] Most men's groaning is greater then
their strokes or sufferings. Invalidum ^mus natura querulum est? Senec.
Some are ever whining and growling: their lips, like rusty hinges, move not
without murmuring and m^^tinying, yea they not only creak but break, as rotten
boughs do, if but alittle weight be hung upon them. Or as some men's flesh,
which if never so little ^^ved with a pin, it presently rankleth and festereth.
Job was none of these; if he groaned, as he did (and will they deny him that
ease of his color? Expletur la^^ry mis, Ovi^
(...) ^olor) there was very great cause for it, (...) his pressures were
greater then could be expressed by any signs or words.

Verse 3. Oh that I knew where I might find him.] that is, God, so often in his
mind and mouth, that his acquaintance might easlly know whom he mean. Aph-H^;
everu ^^ 2. Kings 2.14. is held by some to be one of Gods Attributes. And
(...), Weem^^
without mention of (...), was an ordinary oath in Plato's mouth, as (...)

That I might come even to his seat] His Tribunal prepared for him, Great is
the confidence of a good conscience. Venirem usque ad stationem ejus. Mercer.
See Genesis 20.5. 1 Pet. 3.21. But yet hac certe. omnia andacius dituntur a
misero homun^ione; this was too bold a speech for a mortal creature, as God
himself(who gave him his wish) will afterward tell him, chap 38.2. and 40.2.
and contrary to that which he had before resolved on, chap. 9.3. See the like
failing in David, Psalm 39 1, 3. and 2 Samuel 6.8, 9. In these examples of so
good men, we may see how natural it is to us in affliction to rise up against
God; Hoc a pietate alienum est, quod adversus Deum praefractius, and
contumtliosius loquatur quam humilitas fidei feras. Brent.
as the horse that casts his Rider, and rises up against him. This the Poets
shadowed out in their fiction of the Giants conspiring to pull Jove out of
heaven. That which may be said in favor. of Job herein, is, 1. That ver 6. he
professes to plead with God in Gods strength. 2. That being accused by his
friends of so foul offenses, he had no other way of clearing himself, then by
appealing unto God, whose most just judgment he acknowledged. 3 That he durst
not have spoken thus boldly, but in confidence of his mercy. 4 That he would
have this his controversy with his friends, (and not his whole life) to be
exactly examined and judged by God.

Verse 4. I would order my cause before him] I would not stick to approach to
his Tribunal, Beza.
there to plead my cause (not against him, as being the Supreme Judge, and not
either Plaintiff or Defendant, but) against your false and wrongful
accusations, which undoubtedly I would disprove and confute by many forcible
and strong Arguments.

And fill my mouth with arguments] Heb. Redargutions, increpations,
reprehensions. (...)
A good Orator will first rightly lay down his cause, state the Question, as
we call it. 2. Confirm it with reasons: 3. Observe what is said to the
contrary, and confute it. Job would do all this, if he might have audience: but
if to God all this, Job was much mistaken: And so at another time, when in a
better mind he could say, Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not
answer, but I would make supplication my Judge. If I justify my felfe, mine
own mouth shall condemns me, etc, chap. 9.15, 20.

Verse 5. Mercer.
I would know the words that he would answer me]. q.d. I cannot know your
minds, O my friends, non understand your words, which yet I believe are little
to the purpose: But God (I know) will utter his mind plainly, and approve my
cause which you so rashly condemn. Thus John Husse and other Martyrs, when
they could not have a fair hearing from men, appealed and applied, themselves
to God, committing their cause to him who judges righteously.

Verse 6 Will he plead against me with his great power?] No, for then you were
in a wo-case. For if Gods breath blow us to destruction, as so many dust heaps,
Job 4.9. if he frown us to death, and nod us to destruction, Psalm. 80.16. What
shall we think of his Almighty power, which none can abide or avoid? Difficile
est contra en^^ scribere qui potest proscribere: It is dangerous dealing with
him, who has at his command thirty legions, said the philosopher to the
Emperor, who would needs crack an Argument with him. And should Job dare to do
it with the Lord of hosts as if stronger then he? The thunder of his power,
who can bear? The stoutest men quake before him; and as the worms when it
thundreth, wriggle into the corners of the earth, ready to run, as Caligula
did, under any bed, or any benchhole.

No. Merlin.
but he would put strength in me] Sic enim ex fidei (...). persuasus, says an
Interpreter. Thus was Job persuaded out of the full assurance of his faith,
that God would deal with him as a loving Father, and not as a severe Judge: for
who can stand before his wrath, or withstand his will? No man surely can
contend with God, unless he put strength in him, as he did into Jacob, Genesis
32. whom he upheld with the one hand, as he strove against him with the other.
This foregoing with therefore of Job, has an excellent commendation in it of
his faith and integrity, yet so as that in some things it is blameworthy. For
who can come to Gods Seat, since he dwells in light unapproachable? neither
can any one see God and live, Exodus 3.4. For this boldness therefore of his he
shall be hereafter sharply reproved; first by Eli^u, and then also by God
himself, stepping forth as it were from behind the hangings, overhearing him,
and saving, Who is this that talks thus? how now? chap. 38.2, 3.

Vese 7. There the righteous might dispute with him] There for Th^^; scil. when
God shall put strength into him: the upright or honest man (who draws near
with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having his heart sprinkled from
an evil conscience by the blood of Jesus Christ, Heb. 10.22.) might dispute
with God, but not unless he have that Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the Just One, to appear in the presence of God for him, Heb. 9.24. as the
Lawyer appears for his Client to put by and nonsuit all accusations, to
plead his cause, and to justify him by the only merit of his righteousness
and obedience. All Saint Paul's care was to be found in Christ, when fought for
by the Justice of God; not having his own righteousness which is of the Law,
but that which is through the faith of Christ, Phil. 3.9. for sordet in
conspectu judicis, quod fulget in conspectu operantis, Aug
that which is highly esteemed amongst men, is abomination in the sight of God,
Luke 16.15 They only may dispute with God, that is, in an humble and laudable
manner plead with him, as did Jacob. Genesis 32.24. and Jeremy, chap. 12^^. who
partake of Christ's righteousness imputed and imparted; opposing to the
appearances of Gods wrath the firm persuasion of his grace, by the Seal of his
Spirit, Et^ quam h^^ non est ^mnium! This is few men's happiness.

So should I be delivered for ever from my Judge] Who would quit me by
Proclamation: and then I should the less care to be condemned by you my
fellow prisoners. I care not for man's day fith he that judges me is the Lord,
1 Cor. 4.3, 4. Where note, what boldness and confidence the upright have in
God; neither shall they be herein deceived, as Job was not.

Verse 8. Behold, I go forward.] Heb. Eastward, which is reckoned the forepart
of the world; because that eye of the world, the Sun, rises there; and every
man looks to the rising Sun.

But he is not there.] sc. In that sort, as I desired to find him, verse 3. he
is not visible to me; he is too subtle for sinew or sight to seize upon: his
judgments also are unsearchable: and his paths past finding out. True it is,
that the whole world is nothing else but Deuteronomy explicatus, a Mirror or Theater
wherein God may be seen; yea, felt, and found out by those that are blind, Act.
17.27. If a man hear a Sermon by night, and in the dark, though he see not the
Preacher, yet he knows he is there. So Job questioned not Gods Omnipresence;
but complains that himself was benighted, and forsaken of his hopes to be
eased of his troubles, outwardly in body, or inwardly in mind: this is the
judgment of the flesh, when under Affliction.

And backward, but I cannot perceive him.] For indeed he is imperceptible by
bodily eyes, neither sits he any where in this world to decide
controversies, as he shall do in the clouds at the last day, when the righteous
shall look up, Luke 21.28.
for their redemption draws nigh; and the wicked shall look on and wail
because of him, (...), Rev. 1.7. they shall look and lament, yea, be mad for
the sight of their eyes which they shall see, as Deuteronomy. 28.34.

Verse 9. On the left hand, where he does work.] i.e. Northward; where God is
said to work; either because that in the North-part of heaven are more signs,
and of more remarkable influence than in the South: or else because the
Northern parts of the world are more inhabited than the Southern, because more
temperate; and so there is more of God to be seen there in his works, as
letters refracted in a glass. Seculum est speculum, que Deum intucamur.

But I cannot behold him.] See the Note on verse 8.

He hides himself on the right hand etc.] He works not so much in the
Southern parts of the world: the torrid Zone is unhabitable, etc. Yet the
Ethiopian Judges were wont to keep the chief Seat for him empty, when they sat
in judgment. And beside the Habassines, that large region of Nu^ia, had from
the Apostles time, as it is thought, professed the Christian Faith: though now it
has again, Alvarez.
above an hundred years since, forsaken it, and embraced (...), and Idolatry.

That I cannot see him.] See the Note on verse. 8.

Verse 10. But he knows the way that I take.] Heb. That is with ^e. He
perfectly understands that there is no way of wickedness in me, Psalm. 139.24
no sin that I do favor, allow, and wallow in: but that the way that is called
^loby, is my delight and endeavor: that I am upright for the main, that my
heart is not turned back neither have my steps declined from his way, Psalm
44.18. I cannot see him, but he sees me, and mine uprightness.

When he has tried me.] sc. With favor, and not with rigor, ( for then who
should abide it? Psalm. 143.2.) God promises to refine his People, but not as
silver, Esa. 48.10. that is, not exactly, lest they should be consumed in that
fiery trial. This David knew, and therefore prayed, Examine me, O Lord, and
prove me. try my reins and my heart, Psalm. 26.2. and 139.23.

I shall come forth as Gold.] Which is purged in the fire, shines in the water:
as on the other side, clay is scorched in the fire, dissolved in the water.

Verse 11. My foot has held his steps.] I have followed God step by step,
walking as I had him for an example, and pressing his footsteps. This Job
speaks of himself, not as vaunting, but as vindicating and defending his own
innocenty; and as giving Eliphaz to know, that he had already done, and still
continued to do as he had in the former Chapter exhorted him, verse 21, 22.
Acquaint now thy self with God, etc. That Is not now to do, says Job; for my
foot has held his steps. Be at peace: I am so, says he, for his way have I
kept and not declined. Now, can two walk together, and they not be agreed?
Receive, I pray thee, the Law from his mouth. What else have I done, faith Job,
when as I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips? Lay up his words
in thine heart; this I have done ex instituto, says he; vel pre demenso, more
than my necessary food, have I esteemed the words of his mouth. So exact a
pattern of the rule was Job; so consonant to Eliphaz his good counsel. Plain
things will join in every point one with another; not so, round and rugged
things: so do plain spirits close with holy counsels; not so, such as are proud
and unmortified. Let these be touched never so gently, nettle-like they will
sting you. Deal with them roughly and roundly, they swagger, as that Hebrew did
with Meses, saying, Who made thee a man of Authority, etc? Exodus 2.14. Good Job
was of another spirit with God, (as it is said of Caleb, Numb. 14.24.) and
followed him fully; ornavit doctrinam coelestem piis ^fficiis, heavenly
doctrine was as the mould, and he as the metal which takes impression from it
in one part, as well as another. His constant endeavor was to express God to
the world, and to preach forth his virtues or praises by a suitable practice, 1
Pet. 2.9. Gressum ejus retinuit pes men's.

His way have I kept, and not declined.] sc. In excess or defect, and therefore
I am no such flagitious person, as thou, Eliphaz, would make of me.

Verse 12. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips] i.e. Ab
ip sissimo Dei verbo, from the very word of God, that sure Cynosura, which he
that holds straightly to, may truly say, Lord, if I be deceived, thou and thy
word has deceived me. But of that there is no danger, since the Scripture is
the invariable Canon or Rule of Truth, (...) In Reg. 3.
says Irenaeus, the Cubit of the Sanctuary, the Touchstone of Error, the
divine Beam, and most exact Balance, as Austin and Chrysostom style it: yea,
the very heart and soul of God, as Gregory. And if Job lived before the word
was written, yet not before the Law of Nature, and the Traditions of the
Patriarchs: which whiles they remained uncorrupted, were the commandment also
of Gods lips; as having been received from his very mouth; and might far better
be called ipsissimum Dei verbum, than the Popes pronunciata, which Cardinal
Hosius profanely and blasphemously pronounces to be the very Word of God.

I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.] I have
preferred (Heb. I have hi^, or laid up, as men do precious things, as
housekeepers do Provision for their Family) them before my bodily food, my
daily bread: and we see what pains men take, what shift they make, V^ been sit
ventri, ut lateri, for food and raiment, and other things requisite to the
preservation of this life present. Now Job knew that Gods holy word is (...),
as Athanasius calls it, the Souls nourishment; and that the promises are
pabulum fidei, the food of Faith, as another calls them; that we may better
want bread, than that bread of life. Hence he esteemed it more, not only than
his dainties or superfluities, but then his substantial food, without which he
could not live and subsist; more than his appointed portion (so some render it)
set out for him by the divine Providence, which cutteth out to every man his
allowance I had rather be without meat, drink, light, any thing, every thing,
says One, then that sweet Text, Come unto me all ye that are weary und heavy
laden, etc. I would not for all the world says Another, Selneccer. Mr. Baxters
Saints everlasting Rest. p. 24.
that that one verse John 17.24 [Father, I will that they also whom thou have
given me, be where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou have given
me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world] had been left out
of the Bible. And again, There is more worth (says the same Author) in those
four Chapters, John 14, 15, 16, 17. Ibid. 708.
then in all the Books in the world besides. Luther said, Tom. 4. Oper. Lat. p.
424.
He would not live in Paradise without the Word; as with the Word it were no
hard matter to live even in hell it self. Of old they were wont to say, It were
better for the Church that the Sun should not shine, then that Chrysostom
should not preach to the people. The Jews at this day will not omit prayers
for their meat or labor. They divide the day even the working-day, in three
parts, the first ad Tephilla, for prayer; Weensie.
the second ad Tara, for the reading of Gods Law; and the third ad Malacca, for
the works of their Calling. And when they have read one Section, they begin
another, lest they should seem to be weary of their task. Whereas if we read
but a Chapter, (not a quarter so long as one of their Sections or Paragraphs) O
what a weariness is it his neither begin we till we have looked over the leaf
to see how long it is; so soon sated are we with this heavenly Manna.

Verse 13. But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?] He is ever like
himself, not mutable, inconstant or various, as men who are (as Tertullian
says of the Peacock) all in changeable colors, as often changed as moved.
Gods name is, I am, Exodus 3.14. And if Pilate could say, What I have written, I
have written, nothing shall be altered; how much more may the Lord, who is the
same yesterday, to day, and for ever? His Decrees are immutable, his power
irresistible. Some think that Job complains here of Gods absolute power, and
little less then tyrannical, exercised against him an innocent person. If so,
Job was surely much to blame, since Gods absolute power is never sundred from
his Justice; and it must be taken for an undoubted truth, that his judgments
are sometimes secret, but always just.

And what his soul desires, even that he does.] Id est, Cupit ac facit statim:
ejus voluntas est executio; that is, He desires and does it forthwith; his
will is present execution. It is his pleasure to lay load of afflictions upon
me, but wherefore it is, I know not. But Job should have known that as God is a
most free Agent, so his will is not only recta but regula; neither may any man
here presume to reprehend what he cannot comprehend.

Verse 14. For he performs the thing that is appointed for me] He has
performed all my necessaries; so Vatablus renders it: it is the same word that
was used for appointed or necessary food ver. 12. Voluntas Dei, necessitas rei;
God has decreed thus to deal with me, and therein I must rest satisfied.

And many such things are with him] I know not but that there may be many more
sufferings yet decreed to come upon me in his secret counsel. Fiat volunt^^
Domini. Godly people though they know not many times what the Lord will do, and
how he will deal with them; yet they always know that he is a merciful father to
them, and will order all for the best. This should content them, and keep them
from chatting against God; and from nourishing hard conceits of him, or heavy
conceits of themselves, as if wicked because afflicted.

Verse 15. Therefore am I troubled at his presence] At the consideration of his
formidable Power and Majesty, I am troubled and terrified: troubled at my
present calamities, and afraid of fiercer. This verse then seems to be a
correction of that wish of his above verse 3. and not unlike that ch: 13.21
Withdraw thine hand far from me, and let not thine dread make me afraid. Then
call then, and I will answer, etc.

When I consider, I am afraid of him] I have always imagined that as it were
weakness to fear a man, so it were madness not to be afraid of God. Let me be
accounted timorous, rather then temerarious.

Verse 16 For God makes my heart soft] Methinks I feel it fall asunder in my
bosom like drops of water, and dissolved with manifold afflictions; so that I
am hardly able to hear up any longer; I am almost done, as we use to speak, and
my heart fails me. How should it do otherwise when God with-draweth from his
the supplies of his Spirit, Phil 1.19. that Spirit of power, of love, and of a
sound mind, 2 Timothy 1.7. Dr. Preston.
Acts 20.22. says that great Apostle. And now behold I go bound in the Spirit
up to Jerusalem, etc. Whereupon One gives this good Note, The Spirit hemmeth us
about, comprehends and keeps us. When a man's own strength would fall loose,
this supernatural strength stays and strengthens it. Hence that of David,
Psalm. 138.3. In the day when I cried unto thee, thou answeredst me, and
strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. So Psalm. 27.14. Be of good courage,
and he shall strengthen thy heart, which else will melt (as did the hearts of
the men of Jericho, Josh. 2.11) like metal melted with fire, or like ice thawed
into water, and spilt upon the ground, which cannot be taken up again. And this
is the soft heart Job here complains of: God had dispirited him, and

The Almighty troubles him]. sc. With the thoughts of his Almightinesse. See
Psalm. 39.11. Tot malis ingruentibus. Jun.
and with so many miseries growing upon him. Now it is not amiss for Gods
people thus to be melted and troubled otherwhiles: for by this means shall the
iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin,
Isai. 37.9.

Verse 17. Because I was not cut off before the darknesse] i.e. The afflictions
that now are upon me. It is a mercy to some to dye betime, as Josiah, and those
righteous ones, Isai. 57.1. who were taken away from the evil to come. when
Gods glory was to pass by, he put Moses into the hole of the rock: so he
sometimes does his servants, till the glory of his Justice has passed upon
others.

Neither has he covered the darkness from my face] i.e. He has neither
prevented my troubles by death, as I wished he would have done, chap. 3. Nor
yet will he put an end to them by the same means: for, Mors erumnaruns requies
(Chancers Motto) Death is a rest from trouble. To the tossed soul it is as
Mount Ararat was to Noah, where the Ark rested; as Michal was to David, a means
to shift him out of the way, when Saul sent to slay him: or as the fall of the
house was to Samson, an end of all his sorrows and servitude.

CHAP. XXIV. Verse 1. Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty.]
HEB. Why are not times hidden from the Almighty? q.d. Who could think any
otherwise, that had not been at the Sanctuary, Ps. 73.17. and there heard, Woe
to the wicked, it shall go ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be
(sooner or later) given unto him? Isai. 3.11. The Jew-Doctors conclude, (but
falsely) from this Text, that Job denied the Divine Providence. And the Vulgar
Latin, to salve the matter and save Job from the imputation of Epicurisme,
takes the boldness to leave out the Interrogative, Why, and renders it thus,
The times are not hidden from the Almighty; lest, by making it a question, Job
should affirm, that times and events are hidden from God, or at least should
wish and desire that they were so. Vatablus thinks that Job here puts on
the person of one that denies Gods Providence, or at least doubts of it: as
if he should say, Ye, my friends, say that nothing is hidden from God, and I
now demand of you how the times, and those things which are done in time, can
be otherwise then hid from him, when as we see wicked men so to take their
swinge in sin, and yet, for ought we see, to escape unpunished? It should seem
by his winking at wicked practices, that he takes no care how things are
carried in this present world; Brent.
as certainly he would do, were he diligens mundi Oeconomus, ant rerum
humanarum conscius. This indeed might stagger a David or a Jeremy in a passion,
as Psalm. 73.2. etc. Jer. 12.1. and make a Diagoras or an Averroes, turn
Atheist. But Job was better instructed in this point, as appears by many
passages in this Book; see chap. 21.16, 22. Neither can any such thing be
concluded from this Text, if we take in the latter part of the verse.

Do they that know him, not see his days?] The whole verse should be read
thus, Why are not times hidden from the Almighty, seeing they that know him, de
not see his days? that is since his most knowing servants could never observe
the times and the seasons (of punishing graceless persons here) which he has
put in his own power, Act. 1.7. Abraham indeed (by special favor) was told
that Sodom should be suddenly destroyed: And Moses could say, Wrath is gone out
from the Lord, take a Censer, etc. Numb. 16.46. As any one is more faithful and
familiar with God, so much better and earlier does he discern his judgments on
the wicked, and is affected therewith. See Hab. 3.16. with the Note. But there
is no certain rule given us, by what punishment to conclude a man wicked,
neither can we safely say at what time, or what manner and measure God will
punish the ungodly in this present life. That of Austin is very right, Some
wicked God punishes here, lest his providence; and but some, lest his patience
and promise of judgment should be called into question.

Verse 2. Some remove the Land marks] Here he instanceth in all sorts of wicked
persons, with their seculi laetitia, impunita nequitia: they go point blank
against Gods Commandments; they please not him, and are contrary to all men;
and yet who but they, so long as it will last? Some remove (or touch) the
Landmarks, which the very Heathens held to be sacred, and not once to be
touched. Inter Ethnicor Terminus numinis lo.o habitua est.
Numa King of Romans made a Law, that if any hid or removed a Landmark, he
should be slain by the next that met him, as a sacrilegious person, or public
Pest. Gods Law curses such an Offendour, Deuteronomy. 27. and the Civil Laws pass
sentence of death upon him. The Chaldee Paraphrast and old Rabbis understand
this and the following Offenses, of the old world, full of rapacity and
impiety. But are there not the like and worse evils found also amongst us, upon
whom the ends of the world are come, in these last and worst times, as Bernard
fitly yoaketh them? Read the Catalogue and compare. In his ultimis et pessimis.
temporibus. Bern.
Reckon also, that you then read or hear this Chapter aright, when applying
each passage to your selves, you learn to wash your hands in innocence, or at
least in tears for these abominations: As also, if ye be not offended at the
prosperity of those who fall into all or but some of these wickednesses, since
the time is at hand when account must be given of all things done in the body,
whether good or evil.

They violently take away flocks and feed thereon] Though they eat that on
earth which they shall digest in hell. Or, and feed them; viz. openly and
impudently, with as much insolence as injustice; and as if they had got them by
right, and not by rapine and robbery. Lavater upon the Text makes mention of a
certain Helvetian Tyrant, who violently took away the Oxen from the Plough of
an honest Countryman, and told him that it was fit that Clownes should draw the
Plough themselves, without the help of Oxen.

Verse 3 They drive away the Ass of the fatherlesse] The only Ass of Orphans,
those helpless, shiftlesse creatures, so merciless are these abigei, which is
no small aggravation of their injustice, (see 2 Samuel 12.3) For all sins are
not equal, as the Stoics once held, but lighter or heavier according to their
circumstances. To rob the rich is a great offense, but to pillage the poor is
far greater.

They take the widows Ox for a pledge] Without which the cannot plough: or. Her
Cow, as some render it, without which the and her children cannot live. A poor
bodies livelihood is his life (as that poor widows was, Mark 12.44. (...)
and the like is said of the Haemorrhoisse, Luke 8.43) crush this snail in his
shel, and you kill him. Now therefore albeit it be not unlawful to take a
pledge for security in some cases; yet courtesy must be used, and mercy must
be showed to Orphans, Widows, Strangers, and such like, because they are Gods
Clients, and he has taken them into his special care and tuition.

Verse 4. They turn the needy out of the way] Either to make room for
themselves as the only men. Stand back, say the Sodomites to Let, Genesis 19.9.
Stand further off, say those in Isaiah, See Prove. 30, 14. Ans. 8.4. Or else,
because when these Spoilers are abroad, they beset the ways, and no Traveller,
Bezai
be they never so poor and needy, can pass freely by them; insomuch that they
are constrained to leave the broad beaten way, and every where to seek out
by-ways and unknown passages, to escape their hands.

And the poor of the earth hide themselves together] Lest after their Cattle
driven away, Junius.
as before, themselves, ^t mancipia nexa, as slaves linked together, should be
taken and carried away by them to such base Offices, as are mentioned in the
next verses. Tyrants are looked upon as so many Comets, or Tempests: Attilas
styled himself, Deiflagellum, et Orbis vnstinatem. The scourge in Gods hand,
and the worlds waste-good: He arrogantly said, That the Stars fell before him,
the Earth shook under him, and that he would make the Inhabitants thereof
wriggle into corners, as worms do into their holes when once it thundereth. We
know who they were (even those Worthies of whom the world was not worthy) who
hunted as Partridges by their cruel Persecutors, and driven out from house and
home, wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth,
Heb. 11.38. where they found the wild Beasts more mild and merciful to them,
then those hard-hearted Tyrants.

Verse 5. Onagri inter fer as sunt efferatissimi, neque unquam mansuescunt.
Merc. Beza.
Behold, as wild-Asses in the desert, go they forth to their work] These
barbarous and brutish Oppressors, skilful to destroy, do live in this world,
as the wild-Ass does in the wilderness, roving and rambling up and down for
booty, whereunto early in the morning they prepare and harness themselves, as
if this were their trade and occupation whereby they must needs get their
living. Hic labor, hoc opus, vel artificium little est, says Lavater. As man
goes forth unto his work, and to his labor until the evening, Psalm. 104.23.
so do these greedy Cormorants, these evening Wolves (as Micah calls them)
these spoylers that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds, when the
morning is light they practice it, because it is in the power of their hands.
And they covet fields and take them by violence; and houses, and take them
away, etc. Mich. 2.1, 2. Job had suffered much by the Arabian spoylers, Fabric.
in descrip. peregr. Hierosol.
those wild-Asses, who continue their old trade to this day, catching and
snatching, vivitur ex rapto: neither can they be repelled or restrained by
reason of their multitudes, and their incredible swiftness.

The wilderness yields food, etc.] Their pillage is their tillage, their
rapine their revenue, whereby they maintain themselves and theirs: as the
wild-Ass picks out a living in the desert. But shall they thus escape by
iniquity? Have they no other ways to work? no better Mediums? Never think it:
In thine anger cast dawn the people. O God; Psalm. 56.7. He will do it: for the
words are prophetical, as well as optative. Treasure of wickedness profit
nothing, Prove. 10.2. Mammon of iniquity, is the next odious name to the Devil;
and to the Devil it will bring a man, 1 Timothy 6.9. English Hubertus, a covetous
Oppressor, is said to have made this, Will; I yield my Goods to the King, my
Body to the Grave, my Soul to the Devil. Pope Sylvester 2. is said to have
given his Soul to the Devil for seven years enjoyment of the Popedom.

And for their Children] We have a profane and false proverb, Happy is that
Child, whose Father goes to the Devil. O faithful drudge! said a graceless Son
once of such a Father, who died and left him great store of ill-gotten goods.

Verse 6. They reap every one his corn in the field] The poor oppressed are
made by them to inn their crops, and tread their vintages in the end of the
year; as the Hebrew imports, Sero colligunt.
without either meat or wages, or so much as a cup of drink, as the eleventh
verse sets forth: which is extreme cruelty, and flatly forbidden, Deuteronomy 24.14,
15. and order taken that the mouth of the Ox that treads out the corn should
not be muzzled, Deuteronomy. 25.4. Quantum igitur judicium, says Brentius, how great
judgments of God then will light upon those who do that to men of the same
flesh, of the same faith, of the same country with themselves, which they ought
not to do to the bruit creatures they make use of? Quo^ malum in Germania
frequent^ssimum est; V^ igitur Germaniae. This, says he, is a common sin in
Germany, woe therefore to Germany. Think the same of England, and take notice
that this is one of those crying sins that enters into the ears of the Lord of
Sabbath, Jam. 5.4. and he will hear, for he is gracious, Exodus 22.27. The words
are otherwise sensed by some: but this to me seems most suitable to the
subsequent verses.

Verse 7. They cause the naked to lodge without clothing] viz. By denying and
detaining from them that they have earned, wherewith they should provide them
garments, which are so called, quasi gardments: because they serve to guard
men's bodies from the injury of the weather. They cause them to lodge naked,
because they have no clothing; so some read the text, they lay them open to
the pinching cold of the night. And what a misery it is to lie a cold and wet,
and not to have wherewith to keep us warm and dry, in winter season especially,
who knows not? Hic disce Deo gratus esse, says Lavater. Here then learn
thankfulness to God, thou that have not only a warm and wholesome lodging-room,
but also good store of bed-cloaths; and those of the better sort too. Abuse not
these blessings to pride and luxury, lest God turn in upon thee spoylers and
plunderers, who may leave thee little enough; leave thee nuaum tanquam ex mari,
as they did many in these late shredding and stripping times, Ezekiel. 25.4. God
threatens to send the men of the East to dwell (as so many Lord-Danes) in
their Palaces, and to eat their milk, etc. When the Children play with their
meat, and cast it to the Dogs, what can the Father do less, than bid, Take away?

Verse 8. They are wet with the showers of the mountains] Wet they are, but not
at all refreshed as this word (here only found in the Bible) signifies
sometimes among the Rabbis. Cold comfort they find abroad; and at home they
dare not abide, lest rich men should oppress them and draw them before the
judgement-seats, Jam. 2.6. or drag them to prison for refusing their drudgery.
Hence they are forced to live in the mountains, and desert places, in extreme
misery.

And embrace the Rock for want of a shelter] Like Conies or wild Beasts, glad
of any lurking place, that may keep them out of the hands of unreasonable and
wicked men. What hardship have many worthy men in all ages suffered from
persecutors and oppressors (in Dio^lesians days especially) driven out of
house and harbor, and glad to take up in any hole, there to lie on the cold
stone in stead of a warm bed, (as that good Duchess of Suffolk, with that
noble Gentleman her Husband did in the Low Countries, whiter they fled from the
Marian persecution) till, In Loc.
as Elias once under the Juniper, they wish themselves out of the world? Iterum
hic disc^ gratias Deo agere, says L^vater. Here again learn to give thanks to
God for this great benefit, if thou may stay at home, and not be forced to
fly for thy life, or for conscience sake; for home is home, as we say, and
very desirable: and the Apostle reckons it for a piece of his sufferings, that
he was (...), and had no settled station, (...)
no certain dwelling place, 1 Cor. 4.11.

Verse 9. They pluck the fatherless from the brest] What can be more to be
pitied than a fatherless suckling? Who less to be molested or violenced than
the Mother doing that office to her babe? In the Parisian Massacre, one of the
murderers took a little one in his arms, who smiled upon him and played with
his beard; yet this barbarous wretch was so far from compassion, that he
wounded it with his dagger, Act. and Mon.
and so cast it all gore blood into the River. The story of the Infant of the
Isle of Garriser, thrown back into the fire, out of which it had sprawled, is
well known. Ibid.
So is the savage inhumanity of that merciless Minerius the Popes Champion, who
at Merindol^ in France, cut off the Paps of many which gave suck to their
Children; Ibid. p. 868.
which looking for suck at their Mothers breasts, being dead before, died also
for hunger. Well therefore might our Savior say, Beware of men, Mart. 10.17.
It had been better the Indies had been given to the Devils of hell, said those
poor Natives, than to those bloody Spaniards, who dashed the Mother in pieces
upon their Children, as once at Betharbel, Hos. 10.14.

And take a pledge from the poor] Misery, which should beget pity in them,
begets but audacity, and inviteth them to ruin the poor, and fill their
houses with their spoils. Some render it thus, They take the poor for a
pledge; sc. putting them to their ransom, and mean while enslaving them.

Verse 10. They cause him to go naked without clothing] Naked and barefoot,
even with their buttocks uncovered, to their shame, and danger; as Esa. 20.4.
So dealt the Popish Bishops with the poor Protestant Albigenses, at the
Rendition of Carcass^n, in France; they let them have their lives upon
condition, Rivet. Jesuit. vap.
that both men and women should go thence stark naked; those parts that cannot
well be named, being laid open to the view of those Pope-holy Cruciates.

And they take away the Sheaf from the hungry] Or, The handful; that little
that they had leazed; snatching the ears of corn out of their hands, and
condemning them thus denuded and despoyled, to a death which is so much the
more cruel, as it is tedious and languishing. Some read it thus, And those
that carried their Sheaves, they made to go away hungery: either not feeding,
or not Paying their harvest-labourers, and other servants. It is noted in
History as a cruelty in the Athenians, that they put an engine about their
servants necks called (...), and it reached down to their hands, that they
might not so much as lick of the Meal when they were sifting it.

Verse 11. Which make oil within their walls, etc.] See the Note above on verse.
6. and on verse. 10.

Verse 12. Men groan from out of the City] viz. Under the pressures of their
oppressors. Thus did Jerusalem that faithful City, when once become an harlot;
it was full of judgment, righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers, Isa.
1.21. The like die the City of Rome, when, under the Government of Marius set
up against Sylla, she cried out that the remedy was worse than the disease: and
under Pompey, Calamitas nostra magnus est: and under the Caesar's, that the
names of their good Emperors might all be set down in the compass of a
signet-ring: and again under the Popes, that for many years together she had
not had the happiness to be ruled by any but Reprobates: Hen, hen, Domine Deus,
says Fasciculus temporum, bitterly bewayling Romes misery under her turbulent
Tyrants, Hildebrand, Urban 2. (whom Cardinal Benno worthily calls Turban)
Boniface 8. and many other such like Monsters. Of most great Cities it may be
said, as of that strange vineyard in Palestin^, Isa. 5.7. God looked for
judgment, but behold oppression (Heb. a scab.) for righteousness, but behold a
cry. Anima confossorum veciferatur.


And the soul of the wounded (of the deadly wounded) cries out] sc. For grief;
and in prayer to God for ease.

Yet God lays not folly to them] Deus non ponit prohibitionem, so one of the
Rabbis renders it. God puts not a stop to the proceedings, he punishes
not those Tyrants, who do oppress whole Cities, making their lust a Law, and
overbearing all right with their Volumus and jubemus: nothing at all moved with
the groans of the oppressed City, or with the outcries of the wounded. Word
for word it is, Deus non interponit insuls^m quid, God interposeth not any
thing insulse or unsavory; that is, he suffers not any cross mean while to
befall them: Yea, he so carries the matter, as if he favored them; yea,
approved and prospered their crafty and cruel practices: For they live happy,
obtain victories, are magnified among men, Yull. de divin. lib. 2.
they flatter themselves in their own eyes, until their iniquity be found to be
hateful, Psalm. 36.2. Mean while, foelix scelus virtus vocatur; as the Orator
speaks, their prosperous villainy is called virtue: and if any man mutter
against them, Di^ in Ner.
yea if he cry them not up, he is looked upon as a Traitor, as Thraseas that
noble Roman was by Nero.

Verse 13. They are of those that rebel against the light] Against the common
light of the Sun, say some, which they are ready to curse, (as the Atlantes, a
people of Ethiopia, Her^dot.
are said to do) and could wish extinct, that they might sin unseen. Others
more fitly understand it of the light of Nature and Scripture; against which
wicked Atheists rise up and rebel; as malcontents and mutineres do against
lawful Authority. In the poor blind Ethnicks it is to be seen that some few
Principles and Notions of good and evil, right and wrong, truth and falsehood,
are yet to be found in corrupt Nature: like as when Cities and great Buildings
are over-thrown by War, some Towers, some Pinacles survive the violence. Now
some desperate sinners against their own souls, take the boldness to tear out
these Principles, that might any way disturb their course in sin; and to take
an order with their natural consciences, clapping up those Prophets from God,
close Prisoners, Romans 1 18. till at length all that little light is lost, that
rush-candle quite extinct. When wine is powered out of a cup, the sides are yet
moist. But when it is rinsed and wiped, then remains not the least taste.
Even so that glimmering of divine Light left in the natural man is so defaced
by obstinacy in sin, that not the least spark thereof remains. These Bars
have flown so long against that light, that at length they have put it out. And
whereas to those that live under the Ordinances, there is another light risen,
viz. that of Gods Word and works, graceless wretches shut their windows, lest
this light should come in upon them, as the Pharisees did: they hate it because
their deeds are evil, says our Savior: they spurn and scorn at it, says
Solomon, Pro. 1. they are willingly ignorant, Joh. 3.18.
says Peter; they wink wilfully, says Justin Martyr; Vt liberius peccent,
libenter ignorant, says Bernard: they rebel against the light, as Balaam did
when he set his face toward the wilderness, and would needs curse howsoever. Or
as Pharaoh, who sat not down under the Miracle Moses wrought, but sent for the
Magicians. How many are there at this day, who after conviction, get the Bit
betwixt their teeth, like unruly Horses, and run away?

They know not the ways thereof] A carnal heart is not willing to know what if
should do, lest if should do what it would not do. Of such Bernard says,
Festucam quorum us occules cruans.
that they seek straws to put out their own eyes with. If they seek after Gods
ways, it is but as a coward seeks after his enemy, with an hope he shall not
find him: So he is loath to find, and fears to know; therefore he searches no
further, than will serve his turn; and the little light he has, he puts not
under a bushel, but under a dunghill Woe be to these rebels, these Soli^uga,
that refuse, or abuse Gospel Light. Turks and Pagans shall have an easier
judgment. It had been better for them not to have known the way of
righteousness, says Peter, then after they have known it, etc. 2 Epist. 2.21.
Gravis est lux conscientiae, says Seneca; but grav^or est lux Evangelii, say
we: if this light be hated by any, it is merely because it stands in the light
of their wicked ways, as the Angel did in Balaams way to his sin.

Nor abide in the paths thereof] They have no stability, Hos. 6.3.
nor settledness in well-doing. They follow not on to know, but soon give over
the pursuit and practice of holiness; not caring to add to Faith Virtue, and
to Virtue Knowledge, etc. 2 Pet. 1.3.


Verse 14. The murderer rising with the light] Betimes, whiles it is yet
darkish: for here Job shows how those that do evil hate the light, and take
the fittest opportunities for a dispatch of the deeds of darkness, daily
digging descents down to Hell, and hastening thereto, as if they feared it
would be full before they come thither. They spend therefore the whole day in
wicked pranks and practices, prout videtur commodum, as shall seem best for
their purposes, interdin latrones, nocte fures agunt. By day they do what
mischief they may in woods and deserts: at night they return into the City, and
there play the thieves, hoping to do it un-observed. Bernard.
Thus every such one may better say then that Ancient did, Totum tempus
perdidi, quia perdite vixi, I have lost all my time, by spending it loosely and
basely: I have been too faithful a drudge to the Devil, whom Christ calls a
murth^rer; Joh. 8.
and Tertullian calls Furem Veritatis, a thief of the Truth. Two notable
Thieves of Naples, Rain. de Idol. Romans prafat.
(whereof one was called Paternoster, and the other Ave-Maria) had murdered
an hundred and sixteen several persons, at several times and in diverse places.
These were worthily put to a cruel death by the Magistrate: who possibly might
by his connivence and slackness in doing his office, be himself guilty of some
of those murders: since, to restrain justice, is to support sin: and not to
correct, is to consent to the Crime. Hemingius makes mention of a Felon, who
was indicted of seven murders: while the Judge was studying what grievous
punishment should be inflicted upon such a bloody villain, an Advocate steps to
the Bar, and pleading for him, proved, That the Judge was guilty of six of the
murders: for th^^ the Felon was not put to death for the first offense.

Kills the poor and needy] Without Authority, (such as Magistrates have to
kill Malefactors, and Soldiers in a lawful Battle to kill their Enemies: Sum
Talbotti pro occidere inimic^s meos; Speed.
this blunt boisterous sentence was written upon the renowned L. Talbots Sword,
whilst he warred in France) and without any present necessity for his own
lawful defense, as Exodus 2.22. when he must either kill or be killed: provided
that he endeavor first to save himself by flight if possibly he can: For that
Tenet of Soto, a Popish Casuist, is the most false, Quia fugs est ignominiosa.
That it is lawful for a man in his own defense to kill another, because it is
a shame to fly. And that also of Navarrus, that for a box on the ear, it is
not unlawful to kill another, Ad bonor em recuper (...).
for the recovering of his honor.

And in the night is as a thief] That is, very thief: for this as, is magis
expre^^ (...) veritatis, as Mercer speaks, he would not seem to be, but yet
is an arrant thief, ending the day with theft, which he began with murder. How
these two sins go commonly coupled, see Hos. 4.2 and Isai. 13.16.

Verse 15. The eye also of the Adulterer wa^teth.] Observes, expects, and
longs till it comes. Vt videas ill^m non precare infirmitate sed malitia,
says Vatablus; This shows, that he sins not of infirmity, but of
forethought, malice and wickedness; which he plotteth and ploweth (as the
Scripture phraseth it) purveying for the flesh, Quotidie perire me sentio. Suer.
Rom 13. ult. putrefying alive, under a ^abe, of impure lusts, and daily
perishing therein, as Tiberius at Caprea, by his own confession. This beast was
not ashamed of his detestable filthiness; as being a most impure and impudent
defiler of other men's beds. But the Adulterer here spoken of, seeks the covert
of the twilight, and another of a disguise. He puts hu face in a secret
place (so the Hebrew has it) wrapping it in his cloak, or getting on a
Vizzard, which (says he) shall render me unknown, and none eye shall see me.
For as for Gods eye, either he conceits him blind, or presumes him indulgent,
not doubting or an easy and speedy pardon. This is charged upon David, 2 Samuel
12.10. Because thou have despised me. etc. viz. in thinking to sin secretly,
not considering mine All-seeing eye, not caring though I looked on, etc.
therefore shall all come to light, verse 12. Sin secretly committed, shall be
strangely discovered: yea, perhaps the sinner himself shall confess his
sins, as Judas: So sooner on later, God will bring every work into judgment,
with every secret thing, Ecclesias^es 12.14. See also Ecclesiasticus 23.

Verse 16. In the dark they dig through the earth, etc.] Heb. He digs through
houses; i.e. the Adulterer does, to come at his Strumpet, with whom he had
agreed upon a place of meeting for that evil purpose, and in whose bosom by
night (the dark and black night, as Solomon calls it, Prove. 7.9) he spares
not to bury his name, substance, soul and carcass, whilst they glut their
unclean desires by the favor of the darkness. This is a bitterness beyond
that of death, Eccles. 7.26. But the devil presents his Butter in so Lordly a
dish, that the soul spies not the hammer and nail in his hand, till he have
driven it into the Temples. Roger Mortimer, who dug that hole at Notingham
Castle, and was afterward hanged at Tiburn, (a just reward of his Ambition and
Uncleanness) had the experience of this.

They know not the light] i.e. They brook it not, but run full butt against it,
because it discovers and disquieteth them. See on ver. 13.

Verse 17 For the morning is unto them as the shadow of death] i.e. They are in
deadly fear lest the light should bewray them, and expose them to condign
punishment. How fearful was Judah of being shamed, after he had thus sinned,
Genesis 38.23? And how forward to save his credit by sending his Kid by the hand
of that hang by Hiram? Ter. in Eun.
That young man in Terence, was sore ashamed to be seen in the Eunuchs garment,
a token of his Uncleanness; whereas to have done the deed did nothing so much
trouble him. But the children of light hate and shun sin more for the filth
that is in it, then for the fire that is in it: the blackness of that coal
offends them more then the heat of it. (...)
Plato condemns the Poets for setting forth Jupiters Adulteries, whereby the
people were drawn to the like wantonness; and for saying, it were no matter
though men did commit sin, so they could hide it. Si non cast, saltem caute,
say the Popish Shavelings, who are sometimes taken in the manner, as was that
carnal Cardinal Cremonensis, Acts and Mon. fol. 1065. Ibid. 1905. Barns
Funccius Luth. Coloq.
the Popes Legate here, in Hen. 8. days, and Dr. W^ston Dean of Windsor in the
Reign of Queen Mary, apprehended in Adultery, and for the same deprived of all
his Spiritual Livings by Cardinal Pool. Pope John the twelfth, being taken a
bed with another man's wife, was killed immediately by her husband. In Germany a
Gentleman of note and his Harlot, were served in like sort, as Luther relates.
So was Re^^^ldus the Eighth, King of Lombardy; and Sergui a King of Scotland.
Of all these, P.Mel. Chron. Lang. Chron.
and many more esusdem furfuris, it may well be said, as here, that being noted
and notified, they were in the terrors of the shadow of death. Which death to
escape.

Verse 18. He is swift as the waters] He stays not long in a place, but flies
away swiftly (like the River Tigris, swift as an arrow out of a bow) to avoid
punishment. Heb. He is light upon the face of the waters. The meaning^s (says
One) they are as a light thing upon the streams of water running swiftly, and
carrying it away with speed. Some, that it is spoken in respect of their swift
passing on from one wickedness to another, or their never being settled after
such wickedness committed, but always ready to be overturned as a ship that
is unballasted, and so to be drowned in the sea.

Their portion is cursed on the earth] Cain-like, they wander up and down, a
cord suo facti fugitivi; but their sin will surely find them out; neither can
they run out of the reach of Gods rod, etc. This Job says, lest any should
gather from what he had said before, that it should be always well with the
wicked, and ill with the godly. Some take it curse-wise thus, Let their portion
on earth be accursed, neither let them turn themselves to the Vineyards; scil.
either to dress them, or to taste of the fruits of them.

He beholds not the way of the Vineyards] That is, say some, to run away by
them, which were common ways to Cities, but by some other obscure byway that
he may not be found. In Vineyards something is to be done at all times, that
way therefore they take not, lest they should be discovered and punished. Beza
renders it, He turns not into the way (that is, the nature) of the Vines,
which by cutting and pruning, sprouteth out, and becomes more profitable.
Others sense it far otherwise. The concise brevity and ambiguity of the words,
together with the change of number, has caused a cloud upon them.

Verse 19. Drought and heat consume the snow waters] Here also brevity has
bred obscurity. Snow waters as they are more subtle, so they sooner sink into
the dry earth; so dye the wickeds, quickly and easily. See chap. 21.13, 31.
There are that read the whole verse thus, In the drought and heat they rob, and
in the snow waters; they sin to the grave; that is, they rob (and run into
other flagitious practices) in all weather, Summer and Winter, and never give
over till they dye. They persist in their sins (says Calvin) wherein they have
been nuzzelled up, even to their grave. This is a good sense. Luther tells of
one filthy Adulterer, so set upon that sin, that he was heard to utter these
abominable words, If I were sure to live here for ever, and that I might still
be carried from one Brothel-house to another, I would never desire any other
heaven then that. Vae dementiae, and impietati. Theat. Hist. page 568.
This beastly man breathed out his wretched soul betwixt two harlots. Once I
knew a most odious Adulterer of seventy years old (says another great Divine)
who having wasted his flesh and state with harlots, and lying near death, was
requested thus, Potter, call upon God; M. Dan. Rog.
he replied with his ordinary oaths, Pox and Wounds, is this a time to pray? I
knew, (says a third Reverend man) a great swearer, who coming to his
deathbed, Satan so filled his heart with a madded and enraged greediness
after sin, Mr. Bolton.
that though himself swore as fast and as furiously as he could, yet (as though
he had been already among the bannings and blasphemies of hell) he desperately
desired the standers by to help him with Oaths, and to swear for him.
Athenaeus reports of one covetous Mammonist, that at the hour of his death,
he devoured many pieces of Gold, and sewed the rest in his coat, commanding
that they should be all buried with him. And our Chroniclers write of King
Edward 1. that he adjured his son and Nobles, Dan. Hist. 202.
that if he dyed in his Expedition against Bruce King of Stots, they should not
interre his Corpse, but carry it about Scotland, till they had avenged him on
that Usurper.

Verse 20. The Womb shall forget him] Some read it, The merciful man forgets
him; scil. because himself was merciless. Or because he was a trouble to the
world, and a common Pest, therefore good men are glad to be so rid of him; and
in stead of sighing over him, say, Let the worm feed sweetly on him, it is well
he is gone, as he lived wickedly, so he dyed wickedly; let him be no more
remembered or honorably mentioned, but moulder away, and fall as a rotten tree.
Others interpret the words of the sudden and easy death of the wicked, thus,
The womb shall forget him; that is, says Beza, being once dead, neither his
mother nor his wife do bewail and lament his death, because without that pain
and torment, that many suffer when they depart the world.

The worms shall feed sweetly on him] Moritar impunitus, he makes the worms a
feast with his fat Corpse (as Dr. Tailor Martyr made account to have done, if
buried in Hadley Churchyard) and feels no pain.

He shall be no more remembred] And this is reckoned up as a piece of his
happiness See Eccles. 8.10. with the Note there.

And wickednesse] that is, the wicked person, that crooked piece that can
hardly ever be set straight again.

Shall be broken as a tree] As a rotten tree blown down by the wind.

Verse 21. He evil entreats the barren that bears not] Who had more need to
be comforted, then further afflicted. But Homo homini Demon. Jacob and Elkanab
loved and comforted their wives under this cross. The Vulgar renders it, He
has fed the barren, whereupon some expound it of wicked men's feeding Whores,
and maintaining them for their pleasure; keeping them barren, that they may
keep their beauty.

And does not good to the widow] i.e. Does her much hurt; for not to do good,
is to do evil, Mark 3.4. He has afflicted his barren wife, and evil entreated
the poor desolate widow his mother. What marvel then if the womb forget him,
etc. if his wife bewail not so unkind an husband, nor his mother so unnatural a
son, as verse. 30 Thus Beza here.

Verse 22. He draws also the mighty with his power] i.e. He has brought them
by force under his girdle, and compelled them to do him homage and service.

He rises up.] In the fullness of his might, as a King against whom there is
no rising up, Prove. 30.31.

And no man is sure of life] Which the Tyrant takes away at his pleasure. Or
thus, The Tyrant himself, after he has made all cock-sure, as he may think, is
not yet sure of his own life, dare not confide in his best friends: Dionysius
for instance, and our Richard the third. The Hebrew is, And he is not sure of
life.

Verse 23. Though it be given him to be in safety] Heb. It is given him to be
in safety, whereon he rests. His safety and prosperity was given him for a
better purpose; but (as if God had hired him to be wicked) he abuses it to
creature confidence, leaning too hard upon the arm of flesh.

Yet his eyes are upon their wayes] Nevertheless God prospers them
(according to Psalm. 34.11.) Or, as others sense it, God eyeth their wicked
ways, and designeth them to destruction. And the next verse seems to make
for this Interpretation.

Verse 24. They are exalted for a little while] Or, They are exalted, but
within a little while they are not. This former part of the verse needs no
Exposition, says an Expositor. And as for the later

They are taken away as all other, they are cut off as the tops of the ears of
corn] It may be understood of the like violence, Velm frit-spica succidu^tur.
Trem. ex Varr.
wherewith Tyrants shall be cut off, by which they have cut off other mighty
and great men: as Thrasibulus King of Milesians by striking off with his staff
certain ears of corn, and Tarquin King of Romans by doing the like to certain
Poppies in his Garden, signified their minds to have diverse chief men
beheaded: which was accordingly accomplished. So Mithridates King of Pontus, V.
l. Max.
by one Letter caused the death of fourscore thousand Romans, trading
throughout Asia. Now God loves to retaliate as has been said before. See it
exemplified in Adonibezeck, Agag, Haman and others.

Verse 25. And if it be not so now, who will make me a Liar?] Quis ementietur
me? Who shall disprove or confute what I have affirmed? viz. That God does many
things, the depth whereof we cannot fathom, and that he lets wicked men many
times spend their days in pleasure, and end them without much pain. this I
will abide by, and I would fain see the man, qui ansit and possit, who can and
will maintain the contrary.

CHAP. XXV. Verse 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said.]
A Pithy and ponderous speech he here makes, though little to the purpose; for
he quite digresseth from the question in hand concerning the wickeds
flourishing, and Saints sufferings, and chooses to sing the fame song with his
fellows, concerning the power and Purity of God above all Creatures. See Job
4.18. and 15.15. Some men are of that mind, that they will never be said or set
down, but strive to have the last word. This was Peter's vanity and the rest of
the Disciples, Math. 26.35. which our Savior winked at till time should
confute them, as it also did soon after.

Verse 2. Dominion and fear are with him] God is therefore to be feared,
because Lord over all. If an earthly King be so Dread a Sovereign, if an
apparition of Angels has so amazed the best men, who would not fear that King
of Nations, since to him does it appertain? Jer. 10.7. God is greatly to be
feared in the Assemblies of his Saints, and to be had in reverence of all them
that are round about him, Psalm. 89.7. Power and terror are with him, so the
Vulgar has it here. He that is able to destroy both body and soul in hell, is
surely to be feared, yea therefore to be feared, Matthew. 10.28. If servants
should fear their Masters because they have power over the flesh, Col. 3.23.
what should we do, since he can sooner undo us, then bid it be done?

He makes peace in his high places.] Or, Among his high persons, those
heavenly Courtiers the Angels and Saints. By an unchangeable Decree God keeps
all persons and things in the heavens, both visible and invisible in a most
firm and quiet condition, so that there is no clashing, but an happy harmony
amongst them. Senault.
He appeaseth (says One) the differences of the Elements, and obliges them to
force their own inclinations, to preserve the quiet of the world. He shakes all
the heavens with so much evennesse, that in the contrariety of their motions
they never disorder themselves. Finally, He maintains peace amongst the
Angels, and tempering his Justice with his Goodness, he makes himself equally
loved and feared of those blessed Spirits Therefore Job did ill (says another
Interpreter) to offer to make a disturbance there, Mayer. Job 23.4.
(as Bildad at least conceited he did) where there was all peace.

Verse 3. Is there any number of his Armies?] God is Lord of Hosts: and (as
the Rabbis well observe) he has his upper forces and his lower forces, as his
Horse and Foot ready pressed. The upper are here chiefly meant, viz. the Angels
and Stars, as appears by the Context. An est numerus expeditorum? so Brentius
renders it; Tremellius, turmariorum, of his Troopers? they are innumerable,
and yet no variance amongst them: this is admirable. The Army of Niniveh was
quiet, no falling out nor complaining in their hosts, therefore did their King
march on, pass through, Nahum. 1.12. the Turks Military Discipline at this
day, is beyond that of all other Nations in the world besides; yea beyond that
of the old Greeks or Romans. There is no quarrelling heard at any time amongst
their many soldiers, Cusp. de Cas. p. 475.
no nor any words at all. Perpetuum silentium tenent ut muti, says
Cuspinianus: There is perpetual silence kept, and most ready obedience yielded
to the dumb signs and noddings of their Officers. But all this is nothing to
that in heaven. Of Gods Hosts, together with their number, order and
obedience: see my Treatise called, the Righteous Man's Recompense page 868.869.

And upon whom does not his Light arise?] that is, his Sun, that Prince of
Planets, but servant of the Saints, (as his Name imports) whose going forth
is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it, and there
is nothing hid from the heat thereof. Psalm 19.6 It is called, His Light,
because as he made it, so he gathered into it as into a Vessel, that first
light, which before was scattered here and there in the heavens. Some there are
that understand this Text of the light of Gods Omniscience; others of his
Benificence: Qui^ est quem non superet luce bonitate suae? Merlin.
Who is it whom he overcomes not with the light of his goodness: Surely all
the good that is in the Creature is but a spark of his flame, a drop of his
Ocean.

Verse 4 How then can man be justified with God?] Homo frivolus, so the
Tygurines translate: How can frivolous man, sorry man, Morbis mortique
obnoxious, Man subject to diseases and death; how can such a man, so mortal and
miserable, a mass of Mortalities, a Map of miseries, a very mixture and
compound of dirt and sin, be justified with God? How can he be perfect of
himself without the gift of grace, without an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the Just One, who alone is the propitiation for our sins, 1 John 2.2.
Romans 3.25. who is made unto us of God, wisdom, righteousness, etc. 1 Cor.
1.30?

Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?] And therefore born in sin and
under a curse, the sign whereof appears in the woman's bearing and bringing
forth, Genesis 3.6. Our whole Nativity is impure. Hence in the Law it is
commanded, that the woman should be unclean seven days, that the child should
be circumcised on the eighth day; and that the mother should remain three and
thirty days in the blood of her Purification, Levit. 13. for by Nature we are
all children of wrath: and That which is born of the flesh, is flesh. Neither
can any one bring a clean thing out of an unclean, Chap. 14.4. See the Note
there. Surely as a slave begets a slave, so does a sinner beget a sinner.
Hence we are loathsome to God, as a toad is to us, because poison is in the
nature of it. Infantes ergo non sunt inson^es; Infants are not Innocents,
though we commonly call them so, because free from actual sin, they having not
yet sinned after the similitude of Adams transgression, as the Apostle
expresses it, Romans 5.14. But the first sheet or blanket wherein they are
covered, is woven of sin, shame, blood and filth, as may be seen Ezekiel. 16.4, 6,
This should teach us modesty and lowly-mindednesse.

Vnde superbit homo cujus concepti^ turpis! Verse 5. Behold even to the Moon,
and it shines not.] i.e. Either descend in thy thoughts from the highest Orbs
as low as the Moon: Or else ascend from Gold, Gems, Jewels, and other Orient
resplendent Creatures, as high as the Moon and Stars, and comparing them with
the surpassing Majesty of God, thou shall find no more beauty or brightness in
them then is in a lump of earth, or clod of clay: those heavenly Lights will
appear to be as so many snuffs. Or if thou can discover no spots and
blemishes in them, yet God can, without the help of any such Perspective
Glasses as Gali^^aeus gat him, to discry mountains in the Moon. Some think it
was by Moon light that this speech was uttered, and therefore the Moon is
mentioned. But as the Moon is confounded, so the Sun also is ashamed when the
Lord of hosts will display the beams of his glory, Mr. Abbot.
Isai. 24.23, and 60.19. There is a Learned Interpreter who thus paraphraseth
the Text: Consider, that by reason of the Fall of man, the very creatures, that
in themselves are sinlesse, yea the very Moon and Stars (that are so far from
earth, and so near to heaven) have contracted defilement, and are blemished: so
that with God, for man's sake, and by man's sin, even they are not accounted free
from pollution in his sight: Thus he. The visible heavens are defiled by our
sins, and must therefore be purged by the fire of the last day; as of old the
Vessel that held the Sinne-Offering was to be broken if earthen, or to pass
the fire, if of better Metal.

Yea, the Stars are not pure in his sight] What ever they are in ours. A thing
that I see in the night may shine, and that shining proceed from nothing but
rottenness. There is a comparative imperfection and impurity in the Stars and
Angels, chap. 4.18.

Verse 6. How much less man that is a worm] He says not, as a worm, but a
worm it self. So Psalm. 22. I am a worm and no man; nullificumen hominis. as
Tertullian somewhere phraseth it. Vermis parvus in carnc out caseo nascent,
Exodus 16.24.
David in the Arabic signifies a worm (says One) to which he may seem in
that Psalm to allude. The word here rendered a worm, signifies a small worm
bred in cheese or flesh, a Mite, a Maggot. Others say, it signifies
rottenness, which has no strength. Hereby man convinced of his infirmity,
vanity and impurity should learn Virium suarum (...) agnoscere, to give glory
to God, and to take shame to himself.

And the Son of man which is a worm] Lumbricus, quo vix quidquam contemptius
nominari potest; So vile and abject a creature is man: The greater is Gods
mercy to look upon such a walking dunghill: Learn hereby to know God and thy
self, which is the highest point of heavenly wisdom.

CHAP. XXVI Verse 1. But Job answered and said]
BIldad had vexed him with his impertinencies and superfluous discourses of
Gods Attributes, as if Job had denied them, or doubted of them, which was far
from him, witness this Chapter. He therefore rippleth up Bildad with a
continued smart irony, in the three next following verses, letting loose the
reins to his justly conceived grief and indignation, and invading his
adversary with these sharp questions by way of wonderment.

Verse 2. How have thou helped him that is without power?] q.d. Full well have
thou done it, surely. (See a like irony Mark 7.9. and 1 Cor. 4.8, 10) Thou art
a very goodly comforter, and with a great deal of Wisdom thou have framed thy
discourse to my present necessity. Thou look upon me as a poor, forlorn,
strengthlesse, fruitless creature. Thou should therefore have set thy self
to support me and shore me up, by uttering not only commoda, sed and accommoda,
things true and profitable, but things fit and suitable to my distressed
condition. Thou have spoken much of the Majesty and purity of Almighty God
(wherein I well accord thee) but these are words of terror, such as I can
hardly bear. Of strong Physic we say, Quod nec puero, nec seni, nec imbecillo,
sed robusto ^conveniat, That it is not for children, or old folks, or weak
ones, but for the stronger sort; it is not for every complexion and state. So
neither is every discourse for all sort of people. It is a singular skill to be
able to time a word, Isai. 50.4. and to set it upon its wheels, Prove. 25.11. to
declare unto a man his righteousness, which not one of a thousand can tell how
to do it like him, Job 33.23. to seek to find out pleasant words, such as have
both goads and nails in them, Eccles. 12.10, 11. (to prick them on to duty,
and to fasten them to the right, as pales are to their railes) to divide the
Word of God aright, 2 Timothy 2.25. and to give every one his portion in the due
season, Matthew. 24.45. Not as he in the Emblem, who gave straw to the dog, and a
bone to the Ass. The good Word of God, is well applied, is profitable to all
things, as is here hinted; scil. to help the powerless, to save the
strengthlesse, to counsel the ignorant, and to set forth things as they are,
that there may be no manner of mistake; but then it must be wisely handled, and
the help of Gods holy Spirit must be implored, verse 4. that it may be a Word
of reconciliation, a savor of life unto life, 2 Cor. 2.16. and 5.19. and
whatsoever else is said in commendation of it, Psalm. 19.7, 8, 9, 10. Mercer
interpreting this verse and the two following, H^c de Deo accipio, says he:
These things I understand concerning God, and it is as if Job had said to
Bildad, O how bravely helpest thou him that is weak, and pleadest for him that
is forlorn, as if God wanted thy patronage and defense! No question but thou
art a man fit to advise him, and to set him in a course that he cannot
otherwise hit on: This is a good sense also. But what meant Brentius to bring
in Job blaspheming here, as thus, Quem juvas? impotentem? salvas brachium
invalidi? Cui consulis? insipienti? etc. Whom helpest thou, O God? the
impotent? savest thou the arm of the strengthlesse? Whom counsellest thou? the
ignorant? etc. q.d. Surely thou should do so by promise, and it would well
become thee to do so by me: But (alas) thou do nothing less; and hence it
is, that I still stick in the briars, etc. Upon this gloss we may write as the
Canonists do sometimes, Palea, or, Hoc non credo.

Verse 3. How have thou counseled him that has no wisdom?] q.d. Thou look
upon me as a fool and an Atheist; but this thou do with far greater folly:
for I am not the man thou take me for, but can say as much for God as thy
self, and more too: and if I were such as thou would make of me, I might so
continue for any help I should have by thy counsel. The like hereunto we may
say to the Papists and other Seducers, who pretend to tender our good, to
counsel us for the best, and to wish our salvation.

And how have thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?] Heb. the Essence,
or the Reason, or the naked truth: q.d. What ado have thou kept to tell me, no
mere then I knew before? wherein thou have fairly lost thy labor, and missed
of thy design, if ever thou intendest to counsel and comfort me. Very wisely
have thou done it, I must needs say for thee.

Verse 4. To whom have thou uttered words?] And as thou think, words
weighty, and worthy of all acceptance, when in truth there is no such matter:
Bubbles of words they are, and big swollen fancies, sed cui bono? What tack is
there in them? and to what good purpose are they? Melancthon makes mention of a
certain good man, Manl. loc. com. 536.
who reading Aristotle's Discourse concerning the Rainbow, conceited thereupon
many strange speculations, and wrote to a friend that he had far outdone
Aristotle in that matter. But coming afterward to the University, and
disputing there upon that Subject, he was found to be utterly out in those
fancies of his, which indeed were no better then a sublime dotage.

And whose spirit came from thee?] Or, Came out of thee? Was it by Gods Spirit
that thou spakest, or thine own rather? For there is a spirit in man, but the
Inspiration or the Almighty gives them understanding, Job 32.8. Job would not
have Bildad think and term his discourses to be divine Inspirations, or such
admirable pieces, Scult. Ann. page 238
rare sayings, being but vulgar and ordinary businesses. Muncer the arch
Anabaptist wrote a Book against Luther, wherein he boasts much of the Spirit,
and of Prophetical Light, accusing Luther for unspiritual, and one that
savoured nothing but carnal things. The Antinomians use to call upon their
hearers to mark; it may be they shall hear that which they have not heard
before, whenas the thing they deliver after so promising a preface, is either
false, or what is taught ordinarily by others. Some read the words thus, Whose
Spirit admired thee? for the spirit goes as it were out of it self after those
things it admireth. The Hebrews expound it thus, Whose Spirit have thou
quickened, or confirmed by these thy words? Who is the wiser or the better for
them? Quam animam per hac fecisti? What soul have thou gained to God by thy
Doctrine? Confer Genesis 12.5 the souls which they had made, that is, brought to
the true fear and service of God.

Verse 5 Dead things are formed form under the waters] Here Jobs tongue, like a
silver bell, begins to found out the great things of God far better then Bildad
had done, Abbots.
beginning at the bottom, and declaring that nothing is bred or brought forth,
whether animate or inanimate, fish or other things in all the vast and deep
Ocean, but it is by his decree and power. The Septuagint or Vulgar, for dead
and lifeless things, render Giants, and understand thereby Whales, those huge
Sea Monsters formed under the waters.

And the Inhabitants thereof] That is, says One, other fishes in general,
which are in the Seas where those Whales are: For there is that Leviathan, and
there are creeping things (that is, smaller fishes) innumerable. And in
particular certain little fishes that are noted always to swim with the
Whales, as Guides of their way, that they may not unawares coming into muddy
places, be miered there. Aristotle calls them Muscles; Pliny, Musticets.

Verse 6. Hell and destruction are before him] Here begins a Magnifical and
stately description of the Majesty of God; and 1. from his Omniscience; 2. From
his Omnipotence. For the first, Hell and destruction are before him: Not the
grave only, but the neathermost hell, that most abstruse part of the Universe,
and most remote from heaven, Gods Court. Of hell we know nothing save only what
the Scripture says of it in general, that there is an hell, and that the pains
of it are endless, easelesse, and remediless, etc. but God only knows who
are in hell, and who is yet to be hereafter hurled into it. It is the Saints
happiness that to them there is no such condemnation. Romans 8.1. that over them
this second death has no power, Rev. 20.6. That if hell had already swallowed
them up (as they sometimes when deserted feel themselves to be in the very
suburbs of it) it could no better hold them, then the whales stomach could do
Jonas. Luke 22.31. Satan has desired to have th^e; scil, to hell, but that he
shall never have; for they are the Redeemed of the Lord, saved from the wrath
to come, and may triumphingly sing, Death, where a thy sting? Hell, where is thy
victory? etc.

And destruction has no covering] that is, Hell the place of destruction, the
Palace of King Abaddon, (so the Devil is called, Rev. 9.11) and so hell is
called in this Text, because thereinto are thrust all that are destined to
destruction, all the brats of fathomlesse perdition, such as was Judas the
Traitor, who went to his place, and all wicked ones, who shall surely be turned
into hell, with all those that forget God. Psalm. 9 17. This place is not
covered, says Ferus here, but open to God, for whomsoever he will cast
thereinto.

Verse 7. He stretches out he North ever the empty place] Heb. Over Toh^.
Aristotle says, that beyond the moveable heavens, there is neither body, nor
time, nor place, De cal^ text. 99
nor vacuum. But on this side of the heaven there are bodies, time, place, and
as it may seem to some, an empty place: for so the Air is here called, over
which, and not over any solid matter, for a foundation, God has spread and
stretched forth the heavens which are here called the North, because they are
moved about the North Pole, and besides the North is held the upper part of the
world, according to that of Virgil, Mundus ut ad Scythiam Riphaeasque arduus
arces
Consurgit; premitur Libya dovexus ad anstres.
Hence it is here put for the whole heaven, which held up by the Word of Gods
power, without any other props, leans upon the liquid Air, the Air upon the
earth, and the earth upon nothing.

And hangs the earth upon nothing.] Terra pilae fimilis, nullo fulcimine nixa,
Aere sublato tam grave pendet onus. Ovid. 6. Fastor.

The earth hangs in the midst of heaven, like Architas or Archimedes his
Pigeon, equally poised with his own weight. Of this great wonder, This is the
very finger of God Aristotle himself admireth it. De Call. l. 2. c. 13
the Philosophers after much study, can give no good reason, because ignorant
of this, that God has appoined it so to be, even from the first Creation,
Psalm. 104.5. Heb. 1.2. The Poets fable, that Atlas bears up heaven with his
shoulders: but we confess the true Atlas; viz. the Lord our God, who by his
Word alone bears up heaven and earth: And it is here fitly alleged as an
Argument of his Almightinesse. The greatness of this work of God, appears
hereby, says Merlin, that men cannot spread aloft the thinnest curtain,
absque fulcris, without some solid thing to uphold it.

Verse 8. He binds up the waters in his thick clouds] Heb. Clouds, which yet
have their name from thickness, because they arise from Air condensed. In
these God bottleth up the rain, and there keeps it in by main strength (as
the word signifies) though those vessels are as thin, and thinner then the
liquor that is contained in them. This duly weighed, were enough to convince an
Atheist, especially if he consider how.

The cloud is not rent under them] And so causes a cataclysme to drown the
earth, as sometimes at sea especially, great hurt is done this way among ships,
by a spout, as Mariners call it, the Greeks (...), and the Dutch Ein
Wolckenbruch, or Heavenbreach; viz. when clouds cleave asunder, and discharge
themselves all at once, for a great mischief to mankind. Now that God thus
binds up these heavy vapors, and keeps them in the clouds as a strong man in a
Cobweb, till brought by the winds whithersoever he pleases to appoint them,
they drop upon the earth buy little and little, to make it fruitful; this is a
wonderful work of God, and should bring us to the knowledge of his Power,
Wisdom and Goodness, Romans 1.19, 20. see Job. 38.37. Jer. 5.22.

Verse 9 He holds back the face of his Throne] i.e. Of heaven, Isai. 66.1.
which he eftsoons overcloudeth and muffleth up or masketh, with a vail:
mystically, by the Face of his Throne, we may understand the knowledge of his
glory: for this is held from us so in this world, that we cannot perfectly know
him as he is, but must content our selves with a learned ignorance, 1. Joh.
3.3. Here darkness is, and will be under his feet, Psalm. 18.9.

And spreads his cloud upon it] It is fitly called, his cloud, because 1. It
is his handiwork, Psalm. 18.11. Genesis 9.14. Job 28.26, 27. and 37.15, 16. and
38.9. Psa. 104.5. His Sun draws up those vapors, which being thickened in the
middle Region of the air, by the cold encompassing and driving them together,
become a cloud. 2 He used it of old as a sign of his glorious Power, and
gracious presence with his people, Exodus 13.21. and 16.10. 2 Chronicles. 5.13, 14.
And as a figure of Christ's guiding and protecting his Church through the
wilderness of this world, Isai. 4.5, 6. 3. He still rides in state upon the
clouds, Isai. 19.1. Christ was by a cloud coached up to heaven, Act. 1.9. and
shall come in like manner, Apoc. 1.7. and 10.1. We also shall then be caught up
in the clouds to meet the Lord in the Air, and so shall we ever be with the
Lord, 1 Thessal. 4.17. -- O mora! Christ veni.

Verse 10. Trem.
He has compassed the waters with bounds] Decreto circinavit superficiem
aquarum: He has as it were with a pair of Compasses drawn a circle about the
sea, that it may not pass to drown the earth. Confer chap. 38.8, 10, 11. Psalm.
33.7. and 89.10. and 104 9. Prove. 8.29. So he drew a circle round about the
earth, Prove. 8.27. doing all with infinite Wisdom, Pondere, mensura numero,
etc. He founded the earth not upon solid Rocks, but fluid waters. And that it
floteth not upon them, nor is shaken with them (as often as there is a tempest in
the Ocean that begirteth it) neither yet is overflowed by them, this is the
wonderful-work of God. Aristotle in his Book De Mirabil^bus, admireth it, and
acknowledges Gods providence, which elsewhere he denies. Terminum aquis
prescripsit, says Job here. And this either he had from Moses. Genesis 1.10. or,
if he lived before Moses, as it is most likely he did; he had it, as he had
many other things, by tradition from the Fathers. Sailors tell us, that as they
draw nigh to the shore, when they enter into a haven, they run as it were down
hill, And yet men are said to go down (not up) to the sea in ships, Psalm.
107.23. See a reason hereof in this Text, and Psalm: 104.96. An vero non
stupendum est? says Lavater. But is it not a wonderful thing, that so fierce
an Element, so huge a mass of waters, tossed by the winds, should be bounded
and bridled by sands, confined and kept within their prescribed place and
shore? Especially if the water be (as some affirm) ten times bigger then the
earth, the air then the water, the fire then the air.

Until the day and night come to an end] Heb. Until the consummation of light
with darkness; that is, till time shall be no more, till the end of the world,
when all things shall be let loose to devastation, and the sea shall overflow
the Land again, as that then it shall, some would gather from this Text.

Verse 11. The Pillars of heaven tremble] i.e. the Angels, say some, who
tremble out of conscience of their own comparative imperfections. The best of
Saints on earth, say others (according to Gal. 2.9. Rev. 3.12. Prove. 9.1, 2.)
who tremble at Gods Word, Isai. 66.2. and have many concussions by afflictions.
But better understand the Firmament of heaven, Hag. 26, 7. Matthew. 24.29. The
Powers of heaven shall be shaken, they shall quake with the loud check of his
Thunder claps. Or the high and mighty mountains whereon the heavens seem to
rest, as on so many pillars, shaken by Earthquakes, and sometimes with great
astonishment removed out of their places.

And are astonished at his reproof] As all the beasts of the field are at the
roaring of the Lion; Lavat.
Vt quis a gravi and magnae pot^stat^ vire. objurgatus, iremit and ^^hementer
solicitus est, as a slave chidden by a Prince trembles, and is aghast.

Verse 12. He divides the sea with his power] i.e. With his strong winds
causing tempests, see the like Isai. 51.15. so that it lies as it were in
ridges, the top of one wave far from another, Jer. 31.35. That was a strange
thing that is reported to have fallen out at London the last week. On Monday
Aug. 14, 1654. Sever. Proceed. of State affirm p. 4033.
by reason of the great winds the Tide was so low in the Thames. that boys
waded over it from the one side to the other, the old Watermen affirming, they
never saw it so before.

And by his understanding he smites through the proud] Heb. Pride, or Rahab,
which is often put for Egypt; as Psalm. 87.4. and 89.10. Isai. 51.9. whence some
would have Pharaoh meant: others the Devil: others, the Whale dashing against a
Rock, or driven to shore where he is taken: others, the proud waves of the sea,
He has the sea in as great awe as a Giant has a Pigmee.
as chap 38.11. disabled by God to stir more; as a man mortally wounded, is to
fight longer. An instance hereof we have in the history of Jonas, and another
in the Gospel, Mat. 8. and 14. As God is powerful enough to raise storms, so
he is wise enough to lay them again, Psalm. 107.25, 29.

Verse 13. By his Spirit he has garnished the heavens] Spiritu ejus coeli sunt
ipsa pul^^^cudo. By his Spirit the heavens are beauty it self, so Vatablus.
renders it. That Three ^^ One, and One in Three, wrought in the Creation, see
Psalm. 33.6. Adoravit, decoravit, pulchrcfecit. Hins (...).
By the Word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the
breath of his mouth Here Jehovah, his Word and his Spirit, are noted to be the
Maker of the world, so Genesis 1. The Heathens had some blind notions hereof, as
appears by Plutark, who reports that in Thebe a Town of Egypt, they
worshipped a God whom they acknowledged to be immortal; but how painted they
him? Plut. de Ifid. and Ofirid. Var. dear rust. lib. 2. c. 1.
In the likeness of a man blowing an egg out of his mouth; to signify, that
he made the round world by the Spirit of his mouth. Upon the heavens
especially, God has bestowed a great deal of skill and workmanship, as
appears, Heb. 11 10. and Psalm. 8.3. where heaven is called, The work of Gods
fingers; a curious divine work: a Metaphor from them that make Tapestry.
Garnished it is with Stars, as a Palace is with stately Pictures, besides the
inward beauty which is unconceivable. There is something of a Saphir in the
Hebrew word here rendered Garnished, and Revel. 21. search is made through all.

had. Gold, Pearls, and precious Stones of all sorts, and what can these serve
to? only to shadow out the glory of the walls of the new Jerusalem, and the

most likely to be here meant; and compares Isai. 27.1. Psalm. 104.26, Job.
40.20. Neither need we wonder, says he, that the beginning of the verse is of
heaven, and the end of the sea: for Job would show and set forth two admirable
works of God, in two extremes of the world viz. in heaven above, and in the
waters under the earth. his Power and Wisdom shines every where in the
Creatures, neither can a (...) easily sook besides a miracle. Job therefore

spoken. Lequimur de Deo non quantum debemus, sed quantum possumus. says
Gratian the Emperor, We speak of God, I^ Epist ad Ambros.
not so much as we should, but so much as we can. We prophecy but in part, and
what wonder, since we know but in part, 1 Cor. 13. In humane things, the wisest
men have professed, that the greatest part of what they knew, was the least of
that they knew not: how much more in things divine? By no expressions do we so
fully set forth God, says Scaliger, as by those which set forth our ignorance.
Our safest Eloquence concerning God, is our silence, says learned Hooker.

But the thunder of his power, who can understand?] Heb. Of his powers; that
is, his powerful thunder: which whilst Alladius King of the Latins would by
certain Engines (that he had made him) imitate, he justly perished by a
Thunderbolt from heaven, his house also, wherein he had attempted so to do, was
consumed with fire from heaven, as Dionys. Halicarn. and Orosius testify. Some
by thunder here understand Gods astonishing presence and utterance of himself.
Others, his force and grandeur, his notable and thundering exploits, which
shine all the world over, and to which if all that have been instanced shall be
compared, they will appear to be but as a few heat drops to a great shower of
rain. He that shall go about co declare them, Lucret.
shall be forced to say with the Poet, Clandicat ingenium, delirat linguaque,
mensque.

CHAP. XXVII. Verse 1. Moreover Job continued his Parable, and said]
IT was Zophars turn, and Job waited a while, as it was fit to see whether he,
or any other of them would take up the bucklers again against him; which when
they did not, (as hearing his high expressions concerning Gods Power and
Providence, and happily having now a better opinion of him then before) he
asswageth his grief by defending his innocence, and maintaining his opinion, in
the five following Chapters. Here be is said, after some r^spit, to e^assume
his Parable; which has its name in Hebrew from L^rding it, (...) Sermo
figuratus princ^patum tenet, ac v^lut dominatur.
and bearing sway, because allegories and figurative speeches bear away the
bell, as they say, from plainer Discourses; are more gladly heard, or read,
sooner understood, and better remembered. The word rendered continued. is in the
Original, added (...) lift up; importing either, that he spoke now with a
courage, as we say, and with a greater Emphasis, as having silenced his
adversaries; or that he uttered himself in an higher style, and his matter were
Master-sentences, Maxims Axio^^^, Speeches of special precellency and
predominancy; such as might well challenge a throne in the minds of all men.

Verse 2. As God Lives, who has taken away my iudgement] Job well knew the
Nature and end of an Oath, which is to put an end to all strife and
controversy among (...), Hab. 6.16. For more Authority sake therefore to his
ensuing Discourse, as taking God to witness in a matter of so great moment and
that his friends might the better believe him, he doubts not to begin his
speech with a private oath, (for a public is that which is taken before a
Magistrate, who upon just cause may exact it) which, so it be sparingly and
warily used, is not unlawful as appears by the example of Jacob and Laban,
Boaz and Ruth, Jonathan and David, scil to help the truuth, in p^^essi^y, and
when the other party will not otherwise be satisfied. But what (...) to say,
that the God, whom he so solemnly takes to witness, had taken (...) his
judgment? Can the righteous Judge do otherwise then right? Or does not the
(...) know that he i^ punished less then his iniquities deserved, (...) A Job
was at present under a so^e temptation, and being pressed out of measure above
strength, he spoke unadvisedly with his lips, and is afterward barely told of
it by Elihu, chap. 34.5 The best faith, if long tried, may flag and hang the
wing. Moses at Meribah. David at Gath, Elias under the Juniper, sufficiently
show, that every new man is two men: that the flesh eftsoons lusts against
the spirit, and that the best may have their outbursts, yet so, as that the
seed of grace still abides in them, and some way shows it self; Job here for
instance. He complains of Gods severity, but stormeth not against him. He
blustreth, but he blasphemeth not. He holds himself hardly dealt with by God;
and yet whilst he so solemnly swears by him, he thereby acknowledges him a
witness of his conscience, a Patron of Truth, a Lover of Right, an Avenger of
Perjury, and lastly, the Author and Arbiter of his life, which he resolves
rather to let go then his Innocence: He can do nothing against the truth, but
for the truth, 2 Cor 13.8.

And the Almighty, who has vexed my soul] Heb. Has imbittered. Job should
have remembered, that bitter potions bring sweet health, and that (...), the
bitterness would soon be past: but he remembered only (at present) the
affliction and the misery, the wormwood and the gall, Lam. 3.19. Now no
affliction (but especially soul-affliction) for the present seems joyous, but
grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of
righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby, Heb. 12.11. But patient
Job wanted patience to wait for that Adeo nihil est in nobis magni, quod non
queat minui; such failings are found in the very best.

Verse 3 All the while my breath is in me] Periphrasis vitae, -- Dum spiritus
hos regat a^tus; Whiles I have an hour to breath, I will hold to this Oath of
mine: neither may you ever hope to dispute me out of mine integrity. Life is
described by breath, which when it fails, the man dies, 1 Kings 17.17. Psalm.
146.4. Isai. 2.22. Cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils, every
moment ready to puff out. What is man (says Naz^anzen) but soul and soil,
Eutrop. Ores.
breath and body, a puff of wind the one, a pile of dust the other, no solidity
in either? Jovinian the Emperor, was choked with the smoke of charcoal. Pope
Adrian with a fly, getting into his throat as he gaped. The Cardinal of
Lorrain was lighted to his Lodging, and to his long home both at once by a
poisoned Torch. Defer not (says One) since at the next puff of breath thou
moist blow away thy life.

And the spirit of God is in my nostrils] He seems to allude to Genesis 2.7. or
some tradition of the Fathers to like purpose. Acts 17.25. God gives to all
life and breath, and all things. And again, verse 28. In him we live, and move
and have our being, Wherefore let every thing that has breath praise the Lord,
Psalm. 150. ult. Yea, let every breath (as some read it) praise the Lord. Let it
be as the smoke of the Tabernacle, as Pillars of Incense ascending up to
heaven. Chrysostom.
Tam Dei meminisse opus est, quam respirare.

Verse 4 My lips shall not speak wickedness] Which I should do, should I,
contrary to that which the Spirit of God witnesses to my conscience, through a
fained humility confess, that I have been wicked. Let Gods dejected servant
take heed, left by the temptation of Satan, and the misgivings of their own
evil hearts of unbelief, they be drawn to belly the work of Gods spirit in them,
and to hold themselves utterly void of grace, because not endued with such and
such measures of grace. Learn to distinguish between imbecility and nullity:
show your selves faithful in weakness, though but weak in faith. There is an
allowance to gold, with which it may pass: neither is it to be cast aside,
because it wants some grains, and has a crack. Nec vinum rejicimus e^si
facem habeat, says Spin^us. Spin. de instit: Christ.
God sees nothing amiss in that man whose heart is upright. 2 Chronicles. 15.17.
He lays the finger of mercy on the sears of his peoples sins, as that Limner
in the Story. He will not crush, but cherish that worm Jacob.

Nor my tongue utter deceit] No, for that were to speak wickedness, yea; to
speak your self wicked. For the remnant of Isratl, shall not (by betraying the
truth) do iniquity, nor speak lies: neither shall a deceitful tongue be found
in their mouth; Zeph. 3.13. For he said, Surely they are my people, children
that will not lie so he was their Savior, Isai. 63.8.

Verse 5 God forbid, that I should justify you,] scil. By saying as you say;
viz. that I am an hypocrite, and secretly guilty of some soul practices, for
which I that grievously suffer. I know nothing of this Nature by my self. God
forbid, Absit, res profana sit mihi. The Hebrew word signifies, a profanation,
or profane thing. It was the same they used, when they rent their clothes at
blasphemy.

Till I die, I will not remove my integrity] My perfection some render it, and
so God accounts it, when the bent, frame and tendencies of the heart are for
him; though the man's wants be many and great. This Job knew, and would hold to.
Let not the Devil baffle us out of our integrity.

Verse 6. Mordicus ten^b^
My righteousness I hold fast] As with tooth and nail, yea, though it be to
the loss of my teeth, as it befell that valiant Sir Thou as Challoner, who
served, Cambd. Eliz. 66
when he was young, under Charles 5, in the Expedition of Algier, where being
shipwrack't, after he had swum till his strength and his arms failed him at
the length catching hold of a Cable with his teeth, he escaped, not without the
loss of some of his teeth.

And will not let it go] scil. Upon your persuasions or suspicions, so long as
the bird in my bosom continues singing.

My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live] His heart must needs
reproach him who habitually does evil, what good show soever he does make
before men; and though he hide his wickedness with no less subtle sleights,
then once Rachel did the Idols, Rahab the Spies. Conscience is Gods Spy, and
man's Overseer. It is In^^^, Judex, Vindex: neither is a body so torn with
stripes, as a mind with remembrance of evil actions. This Job knew, and would
therefore keep his conscience clear. This was also Saint Paul's greatest, both
care, Acts 24.16. and comfort, 2 Cor. 1.12.

Verse 7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked] q d. I need wish my greatest enemy no
greater hurt, then to be as the wicked, for then he is sure to be wretched. So
far am I from saying, that God favors the wicked, or that he always
suffers them to escape unpunished.

And he that rises up against me, as the unrighteous] Or, froward and
perverse. This is the same again in other words: and it is well noted to be a
popular manner of speaking, wherein when men express an abomination of a
thing, they wish it so their enemies; taking it for granted, that the power of
malice is so great, that no man can express it in the wish of any particular
evil. See the like phrase, 2 Samuel 8 32 1 Samuel 25.26. Dan. 4.29.

Verse 8. For what is the hope of the hypocrite, etc.] Here Job proves himself
to be no hypocrite, by his and their different character and carriage,
especially under affliction. Though God kill Job, yet he will trust in him; but
what is the hope of the hypocrite, etc? He that makes a bridge of his own
shadow, must needs fall into the brook. The common hope thinks it takes hold of
God; but it is but as a child that catches at the shadow on the wall, which he
thinks he holds fast in his hand; but soon finds it otherwise: so shall the
hypocrite at death, his hope shall be then as the giving up of the Christ, and
that is but cold comfort. Whiles he was in health, and had all well about him,
he nourished strong hopes of Gods favor, and the rather because he gained and
gathered wealth apace. So bladder like is the soul that is filled with earthly
vanities, though but wind, it grows great, and swells in high conceitednesse:
but if picked with the least pin of piercing grief (how much more when struck
with deaths dart) it shriveleth to nothing, and is ready to say as one rich
w^^ch did on this deathbed, Spes and fortuna valeta; Life and hope adien to
you both at once.

Though he has gained] Or, When he has been covetous; raking together (...),
^em, qu^cunque modo rem; See this notably exemplified in that rich fool, Luke
12. whose life and hopes ended together.

When God takes away his soul] Extrabet, Shall pull it out by violence, as a
sword out of its ^eath, when God shall make a breach upon their Citadel: come
upon them by forcible entry, turn them out of their cottages of day by (...),
cut them in twain, as he did that evil servant, Matthew 4. tear their bodies and
souls asunder, as a man teareth the bark from the tree, or the shell from the
f^sh, leaving it naked. Where then shall be the high hopes of the Hypocrite?
And O what a dreadful skreek gives his guilty soul then, to see it self
lanching into an infinite Ocean of scalding lead, and to consider that it must
swim naked in it for ever?

Verse 9. Will God hear his cry] Here Is another distinctive Note between a
hypocrite and an honest man. As many are said in Daniel to cleave to the better
side by flattery, so many false signs will come in, and flatter a man (when he
is in health and prosperity) and give their testimony, speak the same thing
that true evidences do; but this will not always hold.

When trouble comes upon him?] Then the hypocrite will cry, and make pitiful
moans; as a prisoner at the Bar begs for his life. Then Joab and Adoniah will
run to the horns of the Altar, who till then little cared to come there. But
with as ill success they cry to God as Saul did, 1 Samuel 28.15. and as other of
David's enemies did, Psalm. 18.41. For either God answers them not at all,
Ezekiel. 21.2, 3. Or else he answers them according to the Idols of their
hearts, Ezekiel. 14. gives them bitter answers, as Judge 10.13, 14. Or if better,
it is for the good of others, and for a further mischief to themselves, that he
may snatch away his own and he gone, H^l. 2.9. and that he may consume them
after he has done them good, Josh. 24.20 their preservation proves but a
reservation.

Verse 10. Will he delight himself in the Almighty?] viz. When trouble comes
upon him, as in the former verse. No, this is Christianorum propria virtus, a
practice that none can skill of but Gods people, says Hier^me, to rejoice in
tribulation, and then to continue instant in prayer ( Romans 12.12.) for
deliverance, with some confidence grounded upon former experience. Cr^^ cui^^
is inuncta est, says Bernard. Together with the Cross, they have an unction
from the Father: anointed they are with that Oil of gladness, 1 Pet. 2.14.
the
Spirit of glory and of God, which rests upon ^he^; and refreshes them
amidst all their sorrows and sufferings: and hence their delight in the
Almighty, yea though he frown and lay upon them, as he did upon J^^, with his
own bare hand. Not so the hypocrite; for why? he hates God an his heart, as
does every evil-doer, Bernard
John 3.20. Est (...) talium p^na Deus, utpot^ (...) est: ^t quid talibus am
invisu^? God is light, and therefore hated as a punishment to such inanspicate
night-birds. He is holiness, but the hypocrite filthiness, as his name also
imports: How th^n can be delight himself in the Almighty? What complacency
can there be, where is such an ^tter contrariety? They that love the Lord, have
evil, Psalm 81.2^ (...) so does not any hypocrite: leave it he may, but not
loath it: Part with it he may (as Jacob did with Benjamin. lest otherwise he
should starve; or as (...) with Michael, lest he should lose his head) but his
heart is glued to it still, he has a months mind to be doing if he durst.
Finally, He is without faith, and therefore without joy and peace of
conscience. And as for his Spider-web of hope, a little wind blows it down.
The world has his heart, and so the love of the Father cannot be in him, 1
John 2.15. He leans upon the Lord, and says, Is not the Lord amongst us,
Mic. 3.11? yet is he rootedin the delights of life: Like as the Apricock tree
leans against the wall, but is fast rooted in the earth.

Will he always ^all upon God?] Heb. I^ every time? No, nor scarce at any
time. Indeed as begg^rs have learned to (...), so have some hypocrites to pray.
Isai. 26.16. They have powered forth charm, when thy chastening was upon them.
When he slew them, then they sought him, and they returned and enquired after
God, Psalm. 78.34. But this was only a prayer of the flesh for ^ase, and not of
the Spirit for grace. They spoke God fair (as the Devil did Christ) only to be
rid of him. Thus (...) when on the rack, ro^^ed out a consession, and called
for a Prayer. Joa^ in danger of death hangs on the horns of the Altar. The
Captivated Jews fasted and prayed for seventy years, to get off their thaines,
rather then their, sins, Zech. 7.5. which Daniel therefore reckoned lost
labor, chap ^ 13. But many wi^^^d men, though in prosperity they have some
short-wishes (such as was that of ^^la^^s, Numb 23.10. wherewith compare that
of David, Psalm, 26.9. and see a difference) or perhaps are able by strength of
wit and one money to pray handsomely: yet in adversity they set their mouths
against heaven, (...) Wolves, and howl upward, they curse their King and their
God, and look upward, says Isaiah, chap. 8.21. they murmr and mutiny, as the
Israelites in the wilderness, they banne and blaspheme, as did that Israelitish
woman's son, Lev. 14.11. and Micahs mother, Judge. 17.2. A Parrot may be taught
to talk like a man (Histories tell us of one at Rome that could repeat the
whole Creed) but let him be but beaten, and he returns to his own natural
harsh voice. So an hypocrite, while all goes well with him, may seem very
devout at his Orisons, but lay thy hand upon him (says Satan to God concerning
Job, presuming thereby to prove him an hypocrite) and he will curse thee to thy
face, chap. 2.5. But say he be somewhat better conditioned (as they call it)
and for a while pray to God for ease and help; yet he will not pray always, he
will not persevere in prayer, follow on to pray, wait upon God for an answer,
and be content to want it, if God see good to deny it. He cannot draw nigh to
God with a true heart (such a heart as is well satisfied, if God may be
glorified, though himself be not gratified) in full assurance of faith, Heb.
10.22. Which is, says Brentius, Orationis medulla, the marrow of prayer. Hence
Saint James calls it, the prayer of faith, chap. 5.15. Afflictions cause a
Saint to seek out Gods Promise, the Promise to seek Faith, Faith to seek
Prayer, and prayer to find God; to find him at length; For he is a God that
hides himself, Isai. 45.15 But what says faith? I will wait upon the Lord
that hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him, Isai.
8.17. See this exemplified in the woman of Canaan, who fetched Christ out of his
retiring room by the force of her faith, Mark 7.24. and prayed on, though
denied. She would not be said nay, or set down either with silence or sad
answers, but showed her self a woman of a well knit resolution, such as could
credere invisibilia, sperare dilaia, and amare Deum se ostendentem contrarium,
as Luther speaks: Believe things invisible, hope for things deferred, and
love God when he shows himself most angry and opposite. Now this the hypocrite
(who is an Infidel) cannot skill of. He is short spirited and cannot hold out in
prayer, cannot (as our Savior taught by that Parable, Luke 18.1.) always
pray, and not faint, (...) shrink back, as sluggards do in work, or Cowards in
War. Oration est res ardua, and magni laboris, says Luther. Prayer is a hard
work, and a man must tug at it and stick to it, as Jacob did, who wrestled and
raised dust as the Hebrew word signifies: he held fast, and hung on, yea he
held with his hands when his thigh was lamed. Let me go (says God bespeaking
his own liberty) No, thou shall not, says Jacob, until thou bless me. Lo,
such is the generation of them that seek God in sincerity, of them that seek
thy face; this is Jacob, Psalm. 24.6. One thing have (...) desired of the Lord,
and that I will se^k after, says David, Psalm. 27.4. If his suit had not been
honest, he would never have begun it: But being so, he will never give it over
till he has prevailed: he will pray till he faint, and then to it again, Psalm.
119.81, 82. Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in
prayer, Romans 12.12. So does not the hypocrite, for want of an inward principle.
If God come not at a call, he is out patience, and ready to say with that
profane Prince, 2 Kings 6.33. Behold this evil is of the Lord, and what should
I wait for the Lord any longer? Away to the Witch of End^r, to the god of
E^ron. Flecter^ si neque^ saperos, Acheronta moveh^. This Job would not do, and
therefore no hypocrite.

Verse 11. I will teach you by the hand of God] That is, by the help of God,
(...), or concerning the hand of God, what is in the hand of the Lord (so the
Septuagint) what things he is wont to do by his power, Deo juvante and
subministrante facultates. Vat.
and what are his usual proceedings, his actual and efficacious providence,
Act. 4.28.

That which is with the Almighty I will not conceal.] Neque cela^o, ut res
divina comparatae sint, so the Tigurines translate. Envious Masters use to hide
from their Scholars the best and chiefest part of their skill. It is reported of
that spotted beast the Eyux, that knowing that his urine will congeal into a
procious Stone, and so stand man in stead, of pure envy, when he pisseth, he
makes a hole in the ground to cover it. Cardan speaking of one that had a
Receipt that would suddenly and certainly dissolve a stone in the bladder, and
dyed, not imparting his Skill to any one, I doubt not, says he, but that man
went to hell, quod m^riens, artem s^am mortalibus i^viserit, because he envied
his skill to those that survived him. Job was none such: but what he knew of
Gods mind and manner of dealing (which bath no certain Law, nor invariable
rule, but depends upon his ^^er pleasure) he was ready to impart to his
friends, who measured Gods actions by a wrong rule.

Verse 12. Behold, all y^ your selves have seen it] And can say as say as much
to it, as I can in these, sc. that God afflicts good men as well as bad, etc,
Ecce (...) ves ^^^nes sp^culationib^^ (theologi^is) (...), quare tam vanas
opiniones habetis? So the Tigurine translation has it: that is, But behold,
whereas all ye have spent your time in (theological) speculations, how is it
that ye have taken up such vain opinions? The Hebrew runs thus, Behold, you all
have seen, (...) are seers, (and he that is now called a Prophet, was
before-time called a Seer, 1 Samuel, 9.9) ye are knowing men, and of great
experience, why then do ye go against your own knowledge, by speaking vainly
and vilely notwithstanding?

Why then are ye thus altogether vain? Heb. And why is this, that ye are vain
in vanity? sc. Whilst ye ass^rt that Gods love may be known by prosperity, and
his hatred by adversity; and whilst ye conclude me an hypocrite because
afflicted? for so they had all done with one consent. Bildad, chap. 8.13.
Eliphaz, chap. 15.34. and Zophar, chap. 20.5. When as yet, Job had given
sufficient proof to the contrary: The matter was clear enough; but they did
dat^ oper^, for the ^once, obscure it this was a vanity of vanities; and Job
tells them as much.

Verse 13. This is the portion of a wicked man with God] q.d. So ye say, and so
I say too: for herein I will not deny to comply, and to chime in with you.
Z^phar had said the same in effect, and used the self same expressions that Job
here does, chap. 20.29. See the Notes there. But must Job therefore be an
hypocrite, though he continue to hope, and pray, and delight in God amidst all
his miseries, verse. 8, 9, 10? Neg^tur. He had spoken much before of the wicked
man's prosperity: now to ^event mistakes, he discourses largely of his
punishment, and how ill he bears it.

And the heritage of oppressors. etc.] Of feirce and formidable tyrants, that
are a terror to others. These are the rewards they shall receive from the God
of Recompenses, the Almighty, who can well enough deal with them, and delights
to get him a name in their just destruction.

Verse 14 If his children (...) he multiplied it is for the sword] As were
Ahabs seventy sons for instance, 2 King 10.1. whom he had begotten after that
God had threatened to root out his posterity. He therefore as it were to cross
the Almighty, gives himself so much the more (...) to the work of Generation:
but this was ( Ephraim like) to bring fouth (...) Hos 9.13. See the like of
A^atia^ and his forty brethren, slain at the shearing house in the same Chapter.

And his off^spring] Heb. His iss^^s, or egressions, his s^^ts or branches, his
pledges, so Merc^^ ^^death it.

Shall not be satisfied with bread] i e. Shall be pined and a fa^ished, which
their wicked Parents, by heaping and hearding, sought to prevent, but it could
not be, And this shall be a more cruel kind of death than the former, Tacit.
Lam. 4.9. Drusus the son of Tibe^^us N^r^ was put to this death: so was our
Richard the second at Pomfret Castle, Sanders that Traitor in Ireland (...)
and many others.

Verse 15. These that (...) of him, sall ^e (...) death] That is Shall be

And when as he recovered of th^^ ^it in his (...), and (...) for help, his

the great, Schoolman Di^date says, that (...) that the wicked dying are

Agreeable whereunto is that phrase, Rev. 2.23. I will kill her children with

death indeed.

And his Wid^^s (...) One (...) are one of the (...) (their (...) so they die
unlamented by their own widows (for in those days men took many wives, as now
the Turks do so many as they are able to maintain, and very coursely they use
them) who are glad that they are thus rid of them; who were wont to lay upon
them with their unmanly fists, or otherwise to abuse them. Of King Edwin it is
said, that he lived wickedly, died wishedly. And of Henry the second, that
hearing that his son and successor John had conspired against him, he fell into
a grievous Passion, both cursing his sons, and the day wherein himself was
born, and in that distemperature departed the world which so often himself had
distempered, and had now every man's good word to be gone hence. See Jer. 22.18.

Cum mors crudelem repuisset saevn Nero^m,
Credibile est multos Roman agit ass jocos.
Verse 16. Though he heap up silver as the dust] Silver and Gold, what are they
else but white and red Earth, the guts and garbage of the Earth, as one says?
Yet how greedy of them and gripple after them are many much-worms, heaping
apriches, and not knowing who shall gather them, Psalm 39.6? laying up, as if
their lives were riveted upon eternity: or were sure to leave it to their
Children, who yet shall never enjoy it. This is a great vanity, says Solomon;
and yet such dust-heapes as these, are to be found in every corner.

And prepare raiment as the clay] Tantum vestium quantum est luti, says
Va^ablus, that he have as great store of suits in his wardrobe, as he has dirt
in his ditches.

Verse 17. He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on] Well may he prepare
it, so Broughton. Let the wicked men toil and take pains for it; God has
prepared for him an executour never mentioned in his Will. God gave the
Egyptians and Canaanites Goods to Israel; Nabals to David; Human^ to Mordecai,
See Prop. 28.8. Eccles, 2.26. This plague among the rest God threatens the
disobedient with; Deuteronomy. 28.30 Sed haec non semper, says Mercer, although we
see not this always so to fall out, but the contrary; yet it is easy to
observe that many spend their strength, and waste their wits in congerendo and
conver^end^, in getting and gathering these outward things: and then, when to
possess them might leem a happiness, thev die and leave them to uncertain
heirs, as did Absalom and Alexander the Great, who left his Ring to Perdicc^,
Plut.
but his Dominions (...) to him that should best deserve them.

And the innocent shall divide the silver] Shall share it among them as their
Childs-Portions. Solet enim Deus dividere aliis dona, aliis (...) and lucium,
says Brentius here. God gives gifts unto men, even to the reb^ll^^^, but the
use and enjoyment of those gifts he bestows upon the righteous. The former

or Vineyard, who sets him up a Booth, Cabin, or Cottage, to defend him from
the parching heat of the Sun; which lasts only for one summer at utmost: so
here, The experience whereof we have had abundantly in these late desolation
wars: for how many gallant houses have been utterly ruined.

Vt praeter nomen solum, nihil amplius extet? Verse 19. The rich man shall lie
down] That is, the wicked rich man, as Jam. 5.1. Magna cognatio ut rei sic
nominis, divitiis, and vitiis. He shall lie down, viz. in the streets, as being
left house-less.

But he shall not be gathered] i. e. Taken into house or harbor by any man;
but abhorred by all for his former cruelty.

He opens his eyes, and he is not] He looks about him on every side, but
finds no succor. There are that understand it of death; The rich man shall
lie down, Tigur.
sc in the dust of death; but shall not be gathered, that is, nec honorifice
funerabitur; he shall not have the honor of a comely burial. Besides, he
opens his eyes, and he is not; upon his deathbed he looks about for comfort
(the Mole, they say, never opens her eyes till the pangs of death are upon
her:) but in stead thereof shall see that threefold terrible spectacle, Death,
Judgment, Hell, and all to be passed through by his poor Soul: Hence (and no
wonder)

Verse 20. Terrors take hold on him as waters] Abundantly, suddenly,
irresistibly; he is even swallowed up by them and overwhelmed: as he that is
plunged into a deep pit full of water, or that has the proud surges going over
his soul, Psalm. 124. The misery of it is, That these waters are fiery, and Hell
is a lake, but a burning lake, and such also as has eternity to the bottom.

A tempest steals him away in the night] i. e. Furtim, and reponte and
horribiliter; Night is it self full of terror: but much more when a tempest is
up, and thieves are abroad, etc. Oh! it must needs be a terrible time indeed,
when death shall come with a Writ of Habeas Corpus, and the Devil with another
of Habeas animam upon a man at once. Petrus Sutorius speaks of one that
preaching a funeral Sermon on a certain Canon at Paris, and giving him large
commendations, Pet Suitor, de vit. Carth.
heard at the same time a voice in the Church, Mortuus sum judicatus sum,
damnatus sum; I am dead, judged, and damned. Oh! let us but think with our
selves, though it pass all thought, what a screech the poor foul gives when
hurled into Hell; there to suffer such tortures and torments as it shall never
be able to avoid or abide!

Verse 21. The East Wind carries him away] Deus subito and severo suo judicio.
God, by his sudden and severe Judgment, Lava^.
hurrieth him hence to the place of torment, without the least hope of ever
either mending, or ending.

And he departeth] But with as ill a will as ever did Lot out of Sodom; Adam
out of Paradise; the Jebusites out of Jerusalem; the unjust Steward out of his
Office, the Devil out of the Demoniack.

And as a storm hurleth him] Turbinat eum; Tosseth him as a Ball into a far
Country, as if he were wherried away by a fierce whirlewind, or served as
pastime for tempests.

Verse 22. For God shall cast upon him, and not spare] But set himself to
inflict upon this cursed caytiff all the plagues written (and unwritten) in his
book, full vials of vengeance; an evil, an only evil, even punishment without
pity, misery without mercy, sorrow without succor, crying without comfort,
mischief without measure, torments without end, and past imagination.

He would fain flee out of his hand] But that will not be; like a wretched
caytiff he runs without resting: but Gods hand pursues him till he perishes.
He may shuffle from side to side as Balaams Ass did, he may skip up and down as
the wounded Deer: Sed haeret lateri lethalis arundo; the deadly Dart sticks in
his side, etc.

Verse 23. Men shall clap their hand at him, etc.] Heb. He shall clap, etc.
Every He shall, or God shall, as some read it. God shall kick him off this
Stage of the world, and then men shall clap, and hiss at him in sign of
detestation; as they did once at S^ianus, Phocas, Rich. 3 whose miseries were a
part of other men's happiness, who looked upon them as Wolves and public Pests.

CHAP. XXVIII. Verse 1. Surely there is a vein for the silver.]
FOr there is a vein, etc. so Tremellius reads it. But here is no reason
rendered of Gods heavy judgments on the wicked, last discoursed of: but the
unsearchableness of Gods wisdom, and the righteousness of his proceedings
asserted, whilst some bad men prosper, and some good men suffer. The reason
whereof lies hid (as a River that runs under ground) from the natural man
(and in part, from the spiritual also) be he never so perspicacious or
industrious in prying into Natures secrets. The silver vein lies very low, and
far out of sight; yet is found out and known: as also is the art of fining it.
This art was soon learned in the world: and mortals were quickly become
metallaries. Ovid,
Effodiuntur opes, etc. A great part of this their skill they might have from
Adam, according to that of the Divine Chronologer, Ex Adami sapientissimi
Doctoris ore promanavit, tanquam ex foul, quicquid in mundo est utilium
doctrinarum, disciplinarum, scientiae and sapientiae. He that knew so much
before his Fall (far more than ever Solomon did) of natures hiddenest
Mysteries, who can doubt but that afterward also he retained and imparted to
his Nephews a great deal of abstruse and rich skill? such as was this here
instanced, and afterward by Cicero (amongst others) celebrated in his second
Book, De not. deor. where discoursing of men's witty inventions, he says among
other things, Nos aeris, argenti, auri venas penitus abdit as invenimus, etc.
We have found out the veins of Brass Silver, Gold, and other Metals, though
deep hid in the bowels of the Earth. Some of the Ancients have wished that we
had never found out these Metals, because of the great abuse of them. Josephus
says, that Cain heaped up great store of them. Strabo says, that Phaletius
feared, Geog. l. 5.
lest in digging for Gold and Silver, men would dig themselves a new way to
Hell; Et Plutonem brevi ad superos adducturos, and bring up the Devil amongst
them. Some say that he haunteth the richest Mines, and will not suffer them to
be searched. Auri sacra fames, etc.
Sure it is, that by the inordinate love of these metals, he drowneth many a
foul in perdition and destruction, 1 Timothy 6. So subject they are to sin, as
that God made a Law to have them purified before he would have them used by his
people, Numb. 31.22, 23, etc. who should herein have the mind of those
Persians, Isa. 13.12.17. which regarded not silver, nor were desirous of gold.
If Satan offer them these outward things in a temptation, they should answer
him as Abraham did the King of Sodom, with a God forbid that I should, etc.
Genesis 14.23. and send them away from whence they came; as Pelican sent back the
silver Boul sent him by the Bishop for a token, Melch. Adam.
with this answer, Astricti sunt quotquot Tiguricives, etc. All the inhabitants
of our City are sworn not to take any Gift from a foreign Prince. Or, as that
noble Marquess Caracciolus answered the Jesuit, who tempted him with money to
revolt from the reformed Religion, and to return to Italy. Let their money
perish with them, who esteem all the gold in the world worth one days society
with Jesus Christ, etc. Let it be remembered, that gold is that which the basest
element yields, the most savage Indians get, servile apprentices work,
Midianitish Camels carry, miserable muck-worms admire, covetous Jews swallow,
unthrifty Ruffians spend. Gold makes many men run quick to the Devil on an
errand, yea, sell their souls to him, as Pope Sixtus the fifth did, for seven
years enjoyment of the Popedom. But thou, O man of God, fly these things, etc.
1 Timothy 6.11. and while others lay fast hold on these base and boot-less
businesses, lay thou hold an eternal life, verse. 12. But this obiter only.

And a place for the Gold where they fine it] Or From whence they fine it; Or,
Heyl Geo p. 77^
Which they fine. The Spaniards are said to have found in the Mines of America
more Gold then earth. It is accounted of Metals the most precious: but it is
Opinion that sets the price upon it. The only material of money amongst us, is
Gold and Silver; but among the Roman Provinces, it was most times brass,
Corium forma publica impressum. Seneca.
sometimes leather. The like is said to have been used here in England in the
time of the Barons wars: And why not? since Anno 1574. the Hollanders then
being in their extremities, made money of Paste-board. Who the first man was
that made money of Gold, Pliny says is uncertain. But Herodotus writes, Plin
lib. 33 Herodot. lib. 1 Plin lib. 7
that the Lydians were the first Coyners of Gold and Silver for that use. And
Pliny, that Caamus the Phoenician was the first that found Gold; viz. at the
Hill Pangaeus in Thracia; a place that abounds with Gold and Silver, as
Herodotus testifies. Herod. lib. 7
But so did Havilah (afterward called Susiana, in East India) long before
Cadmus was born, Genesis 2.11 Near unto this Land of Havilah, Solinus says, were
two Islands called, Solin. cap. 65
Chryse and Argyre, that is, the golden and silver Islands, because they were so
full of those richest Metals, Vt plerique eas auria sola prodiderint and
argentea habere; that many have affirmed the soil thereof to be of gold, and
silver. Junius thinks that Solinus and Pliny called this Land of Havilah, (by
mistake of Letters) Babypace, Plin. lib 6. c. 27 Solin. cap. 68 Ibid.
the Inhabitants whereof, says Solinus (through hatred of gold, for the hurt
it does mankind) buy up and bury very deep in the earth all the gold they can
get. Like as Crates the Theban Philosopher, is said to have cast his gold into
the sea for like reason (as he pretended when he said, at the same time, Abite
malae cupiditates: ego vos mergam, ne ipse mergar a vobis) but indeed, for a
name, as Hierome rightly judges: Hier. ep ad. Julian consolat.
calling him therefore, Gloriae animal, popularis aurae vile mancipium, a vain
glorious fool. There is no hurt in having these Metals, so we love them not;
Divites magis aurum suspiciunt quam coelum Minut. Octav.
so they do not get within us, as Luke 11.41. so we make not our gold our God,
nor say to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence, Job 31.24.

Verse 2. Iron is taken out of the earth;] that is, out of the Irony vein,
which is said to be a drossie kind of earth, not sufficiently disgested and
hardened to make a stone. Of the generation of these inferior Metals, Plin. l.
33. and 34
see Pliny and the Chymicks; who yet are not to be hearkened unto, when they
tell us; that by their Art they can turn these meaner Metals into gold, since
they are here distinguished by their place, matter, form, etc. Neither is gold
the end of other Metals (every of which is perfect in its kind;) and besides,
the essence of every thing is indivisible, and the use diverse. Iron can do
that which gold and silver cannot. Historians tell us, that Alexanders old
soldiers, armed with Shields of Iron, conquered a great part of the world: But
when as growing rich, they made them shields of Silver, and were therehence
called Argyraspides, they were basely beaten by those whom they had formerly
subdued. The first Inventers of iron and brass, Pliny will have to be the
Chalybes or Cyclopes. Diodorus, the Idaei, Dactyli, or Vulcan. Vulcanum,
inquit, ferri, aris, argenti, auri, omniumque quae igne fabricantur, artem
invenisse, ferunt. Diod. Sic. 16.
And surely if Vulcan were the same with Tubal-Cain (as sundry Commentators
will have it) Diodorus was not far from the Truth: for he taught men to work in
brass and iron, Genesis 4.22. Iron they had before, and the Art of using it, how
else could they have plowed the accursed earth? But this man added to their
skill by his invention, he sharply and wittily taught Smiths-craft, and is
therefore by the heathens fained to be the God of Smiths.

And brass is molten out of the stone.] That is, out of the oar, which is
like a stone, and is called Cadmia, (as Junius here notes) perhaps from
Cadmus, whom Pliny makes the first that invented the use of these Metals,
which Aristotle ascribes to Lydus the Scythian, Theophrastus to Delas the
Phrygian. It is probable that these were the first that showed their
Countrymen the use of these Metals, and so were by them accounted the first
Authors of what was elsewhere found out long before. Aes in medii^ lapidibus
latet (...) sed ignis vehementia lapides aris usque ade^ torquentur ut veluti
flumen ae^^ effundant. Bren
Some render the Text thus, And the stone is melted into brass; that is, by
melting is turned into brass. Many are of opinion that there was anciently an
Art of melting stones, which is now lost. Brass is as it were incorporated
into stone or harder matter; but forced forth by the heat of fire. Hence the
Vulgar Latin thus renders this Hemistich, Lapis solutus calore, in as
vertitur, The stone dissolved by heat, is turned into brass. So excellently
does Job here set forth the nature of these chief metals, as Mercer would have
us to take notice.

Verse 3. He sets an end to darknesse] i.e. He ( viz. the Miner) brings
light down into the dark entrails of the earth, and fetches out those metals
that had long lain hid there, and that else would never have been beheld.
Though Nature has taken pleasure (as One speaks) to hide all these Metals,
yet industry provideth man of certain marks for to discover them, and
infallible conjectures to know the time when they must be drawn out of their
darkness. Habent Metallici suas virgas metallicas, Metallaries have their
Metal-rods, whereby they search into and distinguish of metals and minerals.

Quasque recondi derat, Ovid. Metam.
Stygiisque admoverat undis,
Effodiuntur opes irritamenta malorum.
And searches out all perfections] scil. That is to be found in those
subterraneous Cells, in that bosom and bottom of the earth: the utmost that is
there to be had he thoroughly eviscerateth, digging many fathomes under ground,
where nothing is to be seen, but a deadly shade; Ex cujus horrore mori quis
posset; enough to fright one to death; beside the deadly damps, which suddenly
breaking out of the veins of the earth, do sometimes choke the workmen.

The stones of darkness, etc.] That is, the darkest stones that lie lowest of
all in the earths bowels, whither one would wonder how any man should ever
come; and especially how the Sun and Stars should come by their influences to
make those Metals, and the precious Stones, that are engendered and bred in the
darksom and deadly vaults of the earth.

Verse 4 The flood breaks out from the Inhabitant] Broughton renders it,
from the spring. Illa ergo utribus prae grandibus ex multis bonum coriis
consutis indefesso labor exhauriuntur, adhibitis ad came rem rotis and machinis
idoneis. Merl.
Others, Erumpit fluvius juxta accolam; A River breaks out near to the
Inhabitant; that is, to the Miner, who is forced to leave the place, till by
buckets, wheels, and other fit devices the pits be cleared, so that they may
fall to work again.

Even the waters forgotten of the foot] Broughton, Vnkenned of any foot:
Brentius, Quas nemo pedibus vadare possit. Unfordable waters, deep and
dangerous. To which purpose also the Tigurines translate the following words;
[They are dried up, etc.] thus, Superant etiam hominis staturam, and qui
poterant vadari? They are above the height of a man, and how could they be
waded through? But better

They are dried up, etc.] Heb. They are drawn up, or diminished.

They are gone away from men] Mortalis opera; by such means as men use, and
are unweariable. Trem.
(...), says a Greek Father, What pains will not men take for gain and
emolument?

Per mare pauperiem fugiunt, Horat.
per saxa, per ignes. Verse 5. As for the earth, out of it comes bread;] That
is, Bread-corn: Alma Tellus, Fertilis and ferax. Vatab.
plentifully yields those precious fruits of hers, as they are called, James
5.11. These fruits lie hid in the seed for a season; and so does likewise fire
in the flint (whereof some understand the following words) yet are they brought
at length into the light.

And under it is turned up, as it were fire] That is, materials of fire, as
coals of etc. or brimstone which has fire in it, and does sometimes take fire
in the Mines. Or gold, which is to be tried in the furnace, and diverse
sparkling stones created of a sulphurous matter, such as is that which Pliny
and Isidore call Pyrites Persicus, and tell us, In vit. Apol. lib 3. cap. 14.
that if it be held hard in a man's hand, it burns. As also that which
Hiarchas in Philostratus calls Pantarbe, which burns with a kind of sweet
brightness (says that Author) that dazleth the eyes of the Beholder, and
has a strange attractive virtue. Thus it sometimes falls out, that the upper
part of a ground is fruitful, and brings forth grain and grass, and
underneath are precious stones and metals. But commonly where there is gold
below, there is the barrennest soil above. God and Nature thereby teaching us,
that where the love of money (that root of all evil) grows, there is no good
to be found. A harvest may as well be looked for in an hedge, as true grace in a
gold thirsty-heart.

Verse 6. The Stones of it are the place of Saphires] Which are excellent
Stones, and therefore here joined with Gold; Quod punctis aureis colluceant,
Plin. Vide Boet. Histlapid. lib. 2. c. 42
because they shine with golden sparklings, Exodus 24.10. The Sanhedrin saw the
God of Israel, and there was under his feet as it were, a paved work of a
Sapphire stone, etc. To show, says One, that God had now changed their
condition, their Bricks made in their Bondage to Sapphire. So Isai. 54.11. God
graciously promises unto his afflicted Church, that had been tossed with
tempests, and not comforted, to lay her stones with fair colors, and her
foundation with Saphires; to make her windows of Agates, and her gates of
Carbuncles, and all her border of pleasant stones: To render her all glorious
within, by the curious Enamel and Embroidery of holy graces, and to beautify
also and bespangle her with outward plenty and prosperity, that she might
glitter in the eyes of God and men.

And it has dust of Gold] Or, Oar of gold; better then that which our
Forbisher in his Voyage to discover the Strait, brought back with him, from
which, when there could be drawn neither Gold nor Silver, nor any other Metal,
Camb. Eliz. fol. 189
we have seen it cast forth to mend the highways, says Mr. Cambden.

Verse 7. There is a path which no foul knoweth] That is, say some, those
places where this Gold lies are so barren, as they bring forth nothing else
but gold, Albert. Dionys. Aquin.
nothing for fowls to feed upon, no not discernable by the eye of the Vulture,
which ex^celleth in seeing afar off, and smells out his prey at a very great
distance. But men make their ways even here, to dig and find out gold, being
herein more perspicacious and sagacious, then the very Vultures. The covetous
would do well to consider (says a good Author) that for the most part those
Countries that are furnished with gold, are destitute of better provision, both
temporal and spiritual; that it lies furthest from heaven, and the best of it
in India, furthest from the Church; that though Adam had it in the first
Paradise, Genesis 2. yet in the second we shall not need it; but God shall be our
Gold, and we shall have plenty of that which is better then silver, Job 22.25.
That wise men have esteemed it as the stones of the streets, 1 Chronicles. 1.15. And
that the children of wisdom might not possess it in their girdles. Matthew.
10.19. That wicked men have the most of it as their portion, Psalm 17.14. and
that the devil danceth in rich and pleasant palaces, Isai. 13.21, 22. etc.

And which the Vultures eye has not seen] Or, the Kites eye, or the Pies, or
the Choughs, which yet is said to be sitiens aur^, desirous of gold, and to
hide it when she has gotten it, though she can make no use of it. Some good
Interpreters by this path in the Text, understand the Mines themselves, those
underground places, as far under ground as the fowls fly above ground; and
that are by them and the most prey-seeking beasts unkend and untrod; yet
thither goes the Metallary by his Skill and industry, letting in both light and
vital Air, Quem follibus art mirifica; e sublims deducit, ut respirent
artifices, and alantur lucern^: which with wonderful Art he by bellows brings
from above into those low holes, that the workmen may breath, and the lights
may be kept burning.

Verse 8. The Lions Whelps have not trodden it] Heb. The children of pride (see
chap 41.34) that is, says Vatablus, belluae truces and immanes; fierce and
cruel creatures, which yet pass through Mountains and Valleys and vast
forests, but come not under ground where these Metals are; that is no part of
their walk. Where the Vulgar had his filii institorum here, Sons of the
hucksters, Mercer cannot imagine, and his best patrons are hard put to it to
defend him.

Not the fierce Lion passed by it] Heb. The huge Lion. There are seven names of
Lions observed in Scripture, whereof here are two in this verse, of like sound
the one to the other. The Tigurines render it here, the Leopard; the Vulgar
Latin, the Lioness: And his Paraphrast has the whole verse thus, Those wild
beasts, whose savage humor searches out the most solitary places, could never
yet find them; and the Lionesses, which run every where when they have lost
their little ones, have never approached them.

Verse 9. He puts forth his hand upon the Rock] He, that is, Mortal man, the
Miner, ver. 4. (not God, as Mercer would have it) puts forth his hand: scil.
to dig down these rocks, that he may come at that Treasure, and make himself
Master of that spoil, that is hidden in their entrails.

Nil tam difficile est, quod non sollertia vincit. Alexander the Great being
asked, How he so soon overran the Universe? Answered, I never held any thing
impossible to be achieved. When he had heard of any thing dangerous to be
done, or unlikely, he would the rather set upon it, and say, Jam periculum par
animo Alexandri, This is an Enterprise fit for an Alexander. So of Julius
Caesar, (who had in his time taken a thousand Towns, conquered three hundred
Nations, taken prisoner a million of men, and slain as many) sings the poet
Lucan.
-- Caesar in omnia Praecep^
Nil actum credens, dum quid superesset agendum
Fertur atrox. --
Difficulty does but whet on Heroic spirits; it wakeneth, but not any way
weakneth the courageous and industrious. Hannibal made his way through the
Alps, by breaking down a huge Rock putrified with fire, and vinegar powered
thereon. Hence Juvenal, Juvenal. Sat. 10 Live ^^c. 3. Silyus.
-- Opposuit natura Alpemque nivemque
Deduxit scopulos, and montem rupit aceto.


He overturneth the Mountains by the roots] Or, He turns it up at the roots
of the mountains; scil. which he mineth, by the obstinacy of his labor. --
Labor improbus omnia vincit. Isid. Pelus. lib. 3 epist. 24
(...), says Isidore, the love of money is daring and desperate.

Verse 10. He cutteth out Rivers among the Rocks] i.e. By cleaving hardest
Rocks he draws in store of water to wash the inward parts of the earth, that
he may see what Gold lies hid there: as also, to wash and purge his metals,
which require much washing This is the work of his hands. And then for his eye,
and as a reward of his labor (for the diligent hand makes rick, Prove. 10.4.
and in all labor there is profit, Prove. 14.23.)

His eye sees every precious thing] Heb. Every price; or, All preciousness:
Whatsoever is rare. so Tremellius renders it. His house is filled with all
precious and pleasant riches, Prove. 24.4. Dii ^aboribus omnia vendunt, said the
Heathens. God sells all good things to men for their pains taking.

Verse 1^. He binds the floods from overflowing] Heb. From weeping; that is,
(by an elegant Metaphor) from distilling and dropping, as those underground
waters use to do: but the Miner binds them; that is, he dammeth them up, and
diverteth them, that they may not fall into his pit and mar his work. Thus he
removes all lets, and devoures all difficulties, and all for a little pelf
which perishes in the use, and will rather hinder from, then help men to
heaven. How much more should we labor for the true Treasure, Tertul.
the Pearl of price, the one thing necessary, etc? Si tanti vitreum, quanti
veram margaritum? All those outward things are nec vera, nec vestra, as Austin
elegantly: They are neither true riches, nor ours, but another, as our Savior
tells us, Luke 16.12. Aristotle also teaches us, That wise men may get
riches, (...) Polit. lib 1.
but not make it their business. Brentius reads this Text, Perplexa fluminum
gyrat; He turns about the crooked Rivers, putting them into a new channel,
that he may get the gold and precious Stones that lie in the bottom; for there
are some gold-flowing Rivers: such as are Ganges in India, Pactolus in Asia,
Tagu^ in Spain, the Rhine in Germany, etc.

And (...) that is hid he brings to light] Contrary to the Design of Nature,
he reveals her secrets, and discovers all that she hides by this raking
out of her riches, and making those things that lie couchant in her bowels as
common as if they grew above-ground.

Verse 12. But where shall wisdom be found?] Here is now the other part of the
Antithesis, and the second part of the Chapter; which is nothing so hard as the
former was. Wisdom is either natural or spiritual, 1 Cor. 2. earthly, or
heavenly; Jam. 3 the wisdom here enquired after is supernal and supernatural:
such as can neither be found upon the earth, or dug out of it: such as
cannot be fathomed or found out by humane abilities, or by natural reason. But
God reveals it unto his by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things,
yea, the deep things of God, 1 Cor. 2.10. And with this Heifer must all those
plow, that will find out his riddles. Lud. viv. in Aug ^e C. D. l. 22. c. 6.
Luciosi and qui hebeti sunt visu. says Vives, Those that are weak-sighted and
sand-blind, if at any time they look wishly upon any thing with desire to see
it the better, they see it so much the worse, and nothing so well as they did
before. Think the same of the most accute and perspicacious Naturalist: when he
comes to look into the things of God, he is not only sand-blind, but
stark-blind, 1 Cor. 2.14. he will not see (and therefore who so blind?) he has
an Antipathy to divine truths: he loves the Law better than the Gospel, and
any Truth better than the Law. And as for this high point of heavenly wisdom
(called here illa sapientia, with an emphasis) whereby is understood, that Gods
judgments are all just, even then when he afflicts the godly, and prospers
the wicked, he cannot comprehend it, or yield to it; but is ready to turn flat
Atheist upon it, as Averrces did: denying the divine Providence, and conceiting
that all things were carried on by Fate and Fortune. Jobs enemy-freinds herein
were no wiser than they should be, when they thus rashly censured him for
wicked, because afflicted: and presumptuously took upon them to give a reason
of Gods proceedings in his various dispensations with as much confidence as if
they had been of Gods privy counsel, whereas they should have considered, that
Gods judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out: and that he
who herein is scholar to his own reason, is sure to have a Fool to his Master.

And where is the place of understanding?] As there is no vein to be found of
the divine wisdom, so neither any known place (as there is for gold, silver,
precious stones) where it ought to be sought, save only of God by Prayer, Jan.
1.5 Man, whatsoever good success he has in the forementioned searches, he is
nothing so happy nor dextrous in that of divine understanding. Epiphanius
resembles him to the Mole, which does all his work under ground: but if once
he be brought above ground, as he is stark-blind, so is he every way a weak and
contemptible creature. The best that are, see but in part, and are sometimes at
a loss, about the reason of Gods most righteous proceedings, which men must
mirari, and non rimari, silently adore, and not over-curiously search into:
There is a learned ignorance, says Calvi^, of those things, quae scire nec
datur, nec fas est, which it is neither granted us, nor fit for us to know: and
in this, the very desire of knowledge is a kind of madness. Let that saying of
Xenophanes be remembered; There is no great difference whether a man set his
feet or his eyes in another man's house without his leave. Plut. de curiositat.
Arca^ Dei sunt arca Dei, Gods secrets are Gods Ark; pry not, lest ye come
halting home, for so doing.

Verse 13. Man knows not the price thereof] Or, the order thereof, in what
manner and method God proceeds: no, though in other things he knew as much as
Homer did, of whom one says that he, was (...), a man that knew all humane
affairs: Or as Aristotle did, whom some have called an Eagle fallen from the
clouds: or as Hierom, quem nullum scibile lat^it, who knew all that was
knowable: or as Bishop Andrew, whom one calls (but how truly I enquire not) a
gulf of learning. Sure it is, that man (sorry man) knows neither the price of
divine wisdom, for it is invaluable: nor the place of it, for it is
investigable: nor the order of it, for that is unattainable till we come to
heaven: there being a wheel within a wheel, Ezekiel. 1. and Providence shall one
day be unriddled.

Neither is it found in the land of the living] That is, here upon earth, by
any humane wit or industry: In other texts of Scripture, the time while we live
in this world, is called, the day, Joh. 9.4. and the light of the living, Psalm.
56.13. in opposition to death, which is called, a land of darkness, as darkness
it self, Job 10.22. where they that inhahite are said to be free among the
dead, Psalm. 88.5 free of that company, see Esaias 38.11. None but those that live
spiritually, and have senses habitually exercised to discern good and evil,
Heb. 5. ult. can see any thing of the worth of this wisdom, so as to seek after
it as silver, and prize it above gold: for ignoti nulla cupido, men covet not
what they value not. Now the Cock on the dunghill knows not the price or place
of this inestimable jewel, and therefore slights it. Those Epicures especially,
qui snaviter vivunt, (as the vulgar here translateth) who live in pleasure upon
earth, and are wanton, Jam. 5.5.

Verse 14. The depth says, It is not in me] It is not to be had above ground,
may some say; but what, underground? Not there neither, faith Job: for the
Abyss says, that is, if it could speak it would surely say, It is not in me;
and the Sea gives us in the same verdict: dig to the center of the earth, dive
to the bottom of the sea, you shall hear no tale or tidings of her: she neither
grows with gold and precious stones in the earth, nor with Pearls and Coral
in the sea: we must be taught of God; and the holy Spirit must join himself to
our chariot (as Philip did to the Eunuchs, Act. 8.29.) he must teach us this
wisdom from above, or we can never learn it, Isa. 54.13. A man may read the
figure on the Dial, but he cannot tell how the day goes, unless the Sun shine
upon the Dial: We may read over the book of the Creature, and the book of the
Scripture, but we cannot learn to purpose, till the Spirit of God shine into
our hearts, 2 Cor. 4.6. The Gospel is full of jewels; but they are locked up
from sense and reason, 1 Cor. 2.10. The Angels in heaven are searching into
these sacred depths, 1 Pet. 1.12. and know not so much, but they would fain
know more of this manifold wisdom of God, (...) Ephesians. 3.10.
that has such an abundance of curious variety in it, (as the word there
signifies) even such as is seen in the best pictures or textures.

Verse 15. It cannot be gotten for gold] Non emitur, nec aestimatur, it is not
purchased or procured with money, as other learning may, ( en precium and
praestantiam sapientiae) with a great sum obtained I this freedom, said that
Colonel, Act. 22.28. So may many say of their learning, they have sufficiently
paid for it. Cleanthes parted with all he had for learning. Plato gave thirty
thousand Florens for three Books. Reuchlin gave the Jew that taught him Hebrew,
a Crown for every hours pains. Hierome got his skill in that language with the
hazard of his life, and held it a good bargain. Hen Beaeuford. in Hen. 6. time.
Act. and Mon.
But here is no such trading; see Act. 8.18, 19, 20. Fie (quoth that rich and
wretched Cardinal, when he saw he must die) will money do nothing? will not
death be hired? may not heaven be purchased? No, no, God is no Money-merchant:
his Kingdom is not partum, but paratum. Mat. 25.34. his grace is gratuitous,
Mat. 13.11. To you it is given (and what more free than gift?) to know the
mysteries of the Kingdom of God. And to you it is given (freely given) on the
behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, Vega.
etc. Phil. 1.29. That proud merit-monger, that said, Gratis non accipiam; I
will not have Grace or Grace or Glory of free-cost, could not but go without
both.

Verse 16. It cannot be valued] Heb. Thrown on the ground, as Wares were wont
to be, and are yet, when they are set to sale, and to be prized or valued.

With the gold of Ophir] The word here rendered gold, is not the same with that
in the former, or those in the following verses. Five several times gold is
here mentioned (because so highly prized among men) and in four several words.
Jerome on Jer. 10. observes, that the Hebrew have seven several words for gold;
and five several sorts are here instanced. That here mentioned, is a special
name for the most splendent and glistering gold, Psalm 45.10. Dan. 10.5. Cant.
5.11. Of it comes Michtam of David, or David's golden Psalm, Psalm. 16.1. his
ingot of gold: Broughton thinks it to be no Hebrew word, but the name of gold
in Ophir; Obrizium dictum volunt, quasi Ophirizium: Ophir is Peru, say some:
Others, an Island in the Indies, where the most precious gold was to be had,
called also gold of Parvaim, 2 Chronicles. 3.6. This is supposed to be in Havilah,
Genesis 2.11. It is called perfections of gold, 2. Chron. 4.21.

With the precious Onyx, or the Saphir] The Onyx is a stone said to be found in
the River Ganges, and to be of a white color, like the white of a man's nail,
whence it has its name. See of it, Plin. lib. 37. cap. 6. Boet. Hist. Gem.
lib. 2. cap. 90. The Saphir is a stone of a sky-colored blue, or of a
light-coloured purple.

Verse 17. The gold, and the crystal cannot equal it] For Crystal some read
Diamond; others, Adamant. It has its name from its purity and transparency.
Junius renders it therefore nitidissima gemma. It seems to be, says One, the
last attempt of nature, and makes us find heaven on earth.

And the exchange of it shall not be for jewels (or vessels) or fine gold] Of
Phez-gold, so Broughton renders it; and would have it come from Fesse in
Barbary. The Arabians now call gold Phes. Of this solid fast gold were made
many precious Jewels or Vessels, like that French coin in the Historian, Vas
auri puri puti.
in qua plus f^rmae quam ponderis, in which was not so much weight as
workmanship; Prove. 25.11. Apples of Gold, in Lattices of Silver; or put in a
Case of Silver cutwork.

Verse 18. No mention shall be made of Coral] No talk of Coral or Carbuncle, of
Pearl, or any other the rarest and richest Jewels in all the world. We read of
Cleopatra, that vying with Antony in luxury, she drunk up a Pearl of incredible
price dissolved in vinegar; and of Charles Duke of Burgundy, Macrob. Sat. lib
5. cap. 17 Alsted. Chrono^.
that in the Fight at Nansey, he lost a Diamond of that worth, ut eo tota
aliqua regio emi posset, that therewith a man might have bought a whole
country. It was afterward set in the Popes triple-Crown; but no way worthy to
be mentioned in the same day with wisdom.

For the price of Wisdom is above Rubies] Which are so called from their lovely
redness; see Lam. 4.7. Pearls some render it: of which Pliny says, Plin. lib.
9. c 35.
Principium culmenque rerum omnium pretii margaritae tenent; Pearls are the
principal of all precious things. They were so of old; but they are not so
now-adayes. What huge sums were once given for Saints Relics (as they called
them) and Popes-Pardons? but now the world is grown wiser. England is no more a
babe: there is no man here, Acts and Mon. 990
but now he knows that they do foolishly, that give gold for lead, more weight
of that, then they receive of this. This and much more to the same purpose,
speaks Henry 8. (in his protestation against the Pope) who yet, as a faint
Chapman, went not to the price of this true wisdom; as appears by that
public speech of his in Parliament, There are many that are too busy with
their new Sumpsimus, and others that dote too much upon their old Mumpsimus,
the new Religion, though true, he envied: the old, though his own, he despised,
being as a speckled bird, or a cake half baked etc.

Verse 19 The Topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it] Of the Topaz, see Plin.
lib. 36. cap 8. It seems to have the luster of Gold, and purity of Crystal,
and those agreeable mixtures of colors, which make the purple of Kings. The
operations of this Stone are many and rare, as Rueus sets them forth. Lib. 2.
cap. 9


Neither shall it be valued with pure gold] Plato says as much of moral
wisdom, (...), No Gold or Gem so glistereth. And elsewhere he says, that if
moral virtue could be beheld with mortal eyes, mirificos sui amores excitaret,
it would wonderfully enamour men. Aurelius the Emperor would say, That he
would not leave the knowledge he might learn in one hour, for all the gold that
he possessed. Alphonsus King of Arragon professed, That he would rather choose
to lose his Jewels then his Books, his Kingdoms (whereof he had many,) quam
literas, quas permodicas scire dicebat, Val. Max. Christian. 118, 237
then that little Learning he had attained unto. Many have been so taken with
the study of the Mathematics, that they could have lived and dyed in it. Vae
igitur stupari nostro, Leo Digges.
Woe then to the world because of wisdom: This incomparable Wisdom of God in a
mystery, as the Apostle calls it. Haec quia pr^ vili, sub pedibusque jacet.
Ovid,
Money is most men's study, not without an horrible neglect of piety, which yet
is the principal thing, Prove. 3. and profitable to all things, 1 Timothy 4.8. as
that which has the promise of both lives, ibid. Now the Promises are exceeding
great and precious things, 2 Pet. 1.4. even the unsearchable riches of Christ,
Ephesians. 3.8. Such gold as cannot be too deer bought, Matthew. 13.44.46. nor too
far fet, no, though so far as the Queen of Sheba came to hear the wisdom of
Solomon; and could have been content to have changed her throne for his
footstool. Sure it is, she was no niggard, but parted with abundance of
precious things and sweet odours for that wisdom which she held (and worthily)
far more sweet and precious then all her annual entradoes. Sure it is, that if
the mountains were Pearl, the huge Rocks Rubies, and the whole Globe a
shining Chrysolite, yet all this were nothing to the worth of the wisdom here
commended. How greatly bound then are Gods people to bless his Name for
communicating unto us this unvaluable treasure by his Word and Spirit, 1 Cor.
2. Has he not written for us excellent things in counsels and knowledge, Prove.
22.20? has he not made his Son, that essential wisdom of his, to become unto
us, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption, 1 Cor. 1.30? Should
some earthly Prince give us a rich Ring off his finger wherein there were a
Chrysolite, a Sapphire, a Topaz, or some other precious Stone, how highly would
we honor him, and what would we not be ready to do or suffer for him? And
shall we not much more do so for God, rich in mercy plenteous in goodness,
abundant in kindness and in truth, who gives us all things richly to enjoy? O
pray for that blessed sight, Ephesians. 1.18. and 3.18. and reckon one grain of
grace more worth then all the gold of Ophir; one remnant of faith beyond all
the gorgeous and gay attire in the world.

Verse 20. Whence then comes wisdom, etc?] See the Note on verse 12. q. d. No
where surely is she to be found but with God the fountain of wisdom, verse. 23.
To seek her elsewhere is but laborious loss of time; witness the Philosophers
anxious, but bootlesse disquisitions after the Summum Bonum, the true
blessedness of chief good; about which there were eight several opinions, and
yet all out.

Verse 21. Maxima pars eorum quaescimus est (...) pars cor^m quae nescimus.
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living] As has been before set forth
verse 13. They that see most into it, see but in part, and must needs say, that
the greatest part of their knowledge, is the least part of their ignorance.
Something they know of his revealed will, but nothing at all of his secret.
Whereunto we may add, that there are many occult qualities in nature, the
reason whereof the wisest men undertand not.

And kept close from the fowls of the Aire] Which yet fly very high, and seem
to touch the clouds of heaven; as the Eagle which delights in high-flying.
Some will have the Angels (elsewhere set forth as winged creatures) to be here
meant: who although they stand always in Gods presence, and see much of his
Majesty, yet not at all, nothing near, Isai. 6. they cover their faces with
their wings, as with a double scarf, (as not not able to behold his glory) and
make their addresses unto him with greatest self-abasements.

Verse 22. Destruction and death say, etc] That is, the dead in the grave, and
damned in hell, Junius.
as some gloss it. Others, man in his corrupt estate, though a child of death
yet capable of salvation; and the wisdom of God has found out a way to save
him by his Son, letting in life by the car, according to that, Hear and your
souls shall live. The dead (in sins and trespasses) shall hear the voice of the
Son of God (in the preaching of the Word) and shall live, Vatabl. Isaiah 55.3
the life of grace here, and of glory hereafter, John 5.25. These have heard of
Gods wisdom in his various dealings with the sons of men, and that with their
ears: both with the gristles that grow on their heads, and with the inward ears
of their minds, so that one sound has pierced both; but yet the one half has
not been told them, they can truly say, as the Queen of Sh^ba said to Solomon,
Thou have added Wisdom and goodness to the fame, 1 Kings 10.7. And as David
in the person of Christ, Psalm. 16.11. Thou will show me the path of life:
whereby is hinted, that Christ himself as man did not so fully understand in
the days of his flesh, the unconceivable joies of heaven, as he did
afterward, when his whole person was glorified with the glory which (as God)
he had with the Father before the world was, John 17.5.

Verse 23 God understands the way thereof] The only wise God, who alone
knows her price, knows her retreat. Haec sunt inferni and mortis verba, says
Brentius; These are the words of hell and of death. But we may better take
them, as spoken by Job himself; which yet are to be understood, not as if Job
thought that there was any place, out of God, where his wisdom might be
sought; or any way, out of himself to go to it. But these things are spoken
after the manner of men, says Merlin: for wisdom is in God, yea God is
wisdom it self. For the wisdom of God is nothing else, but the most wise God:
since whatsoever is in God, is God. Therefore seeing he is well known to
himself, how can his wisdom be but as well known unto him? His infinite
knowledge and understanding is in some sort shadowed out unto us in the words
following.

Verse 24. For he looks to the ends of the earth] He is (...), Basil.
all eye: so that together and at once he beholds all things in the whole
course of Nature, and under the whole cope of heaven. His eyes behold, his
eyelids try the children of men, Psalm. 11.4. Where the former points out
Gods knowledge, the latter his judgment, his critical descant, says One. And
surely this All-seeing eye of God, says another Interpreter) should keep us
within the compass of obedience, as much as any thing; since he who is our
Judge, is a constant eyewitness of our cogitatious, communication and whole
conversation. Cave, spectat Cato: Take heed. Cato sees you, was an old
watchword among the Romans, and a retentive from vice. How much more should
this be among Christians? Ne pecces, Deus ipse videt; Be advised, God beholds
you. Think not that he who is invisible cannot see, or that because he is the
high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity; therefore he cannot see so far as
earth; for he looks to the ends and extremities of the earth, his eyes run to
and fro, they are in every place beholding the evil and the good, Pro. 15.3.
The world is to him as a sea of glass, Rev. 4.6. He sees through it, and
every man before him is all window: he sees the very entrals of the soul, the
heart of the heart, All things are naked and open before him, says the
Apostle, Heb. 4.13. Naked for the outside, and open for the inside of them: the
word signifies, dissected, quartered, and as it were, cleft through the
backbone: He searches the Raines, those seats of Lust and most abstruse parts
of the body, so wrapped up in fat and flesh, as if no eye should come at them.

And sees under the whole heaven] His providence like a well drawn picture,
looks every way, and extends to every the least and lightest occurrence;
governing all things wisely and powerfully, and ordering the disorders of the
world to his own glory. Epicures and Atheists would shut him up in heaven, as
has been before noted, as if he did neither know nor do any thing here below;
but they will find it otherwise.

Verse 25 To make the weights for the wind.] He orders wind and water, rain
and thunder, Pondere, mensura, numero facit omnia, -- therefore wisdom is with
him. The winds he weighs in a balance, then when they seem to blow where they
list, piercing through the air with their violent blasts, God sets them their
bounds, and appoints them their proportion: He sends them out as his Posts,
and makes them pace orderly.

And he weighs the waters by measure] Both the rain, (not a drop falls in
vain in a wrong place, or at random, but by a divine Decree, as a witness of
his Wisdom and Goodness, Acts 17.14) and the sea and Rivers: neither do the
winds blow, nor the waters flow without the Lord, who is the great Moderatour,
that measures the waters in the hollow of his hand, etc. Isai. 40.12.

Verse 26. When he made a Decree for the rain] And hence it is, that it raineth
upon one City, and not upon another, Am. 4.7. See the Note there. The rise of
rain out of vapors drawn up from the earth by the heat of the Sun, and the
generation of it in the clouds, is no less wonderful, then the use of it is
necessary for the refreshing and fatning of the earth; allaying the heat, and
nourishing the herb and tree, etc. These showers may seem to arise, and be
carried up and down at random, and without a Law; but Job assures us, that
God makes a decree, a Statute, or a bound for them, and that he gives, or with
holds rain at his pleasure.

And a way for the lightning of the thunder] Or, for the lightning and the
thunder: In both which there is much of God to be seen and heard; these being
the Harbingers, as it were, and Officers to make room for him, and to manifest
his power, which the greatest must acknowledge, Psalm. 29 1, 2. and the Saints
must take comfort in verse 11. As for those impious wretches, that slight these
wonderful works of Almighty God, and speak basely of them (as he of whom Mr.
Perkins somewhere writes, that hearing it thunder, said it was nothing but Tom
Tumbrel a hooping his tubs, and was thereupon killed with a thunderbolt: and
those old Italians that used in time of thunder, to ring their greatest bells,
and shoot off their greatest Ordnance, etc. on purpose to drown the noise of
the heavens:) As they are worse then Pharaoh and Caligula, and other heathens,
who styled their chief god, Altitonans, the high-Thunderer: so they shall one
day see the Lord Christ suddenly coming upon them as lightning, and dreadfully
thundering out that dismal Discedite, Go ye cursed.

Verse 27 Then did he see it, and declare it, etc.] Or, Then does he see it,
and number it, etc. scil. When he orders winds, waters, and other creatures,
he has wisdom ready and in numerat^, as we say; as well known, and as familiar
as men have those things they daily deal in. Illa vero verborum congeries,
faith an Expositour, This heap of words, Merlin.
God saw it, numbered it, prepared it, searched it out, serves but to show how
intimate wisdom is with God, and how proper to him. And lest any should say,
Has God then communicated no heavenly wisdom to his creature? Yes, says Job,
but such as is thus circumscribed;

Verse 28 But unto man he said etc.] q.d. Let him not curiously pry into Gods
secrets, Infignis est hic locus. Mercer.
nor rashly censure others (as you have done me) but out of a reverential fear
of God, eschew evil and do good, for this shall be his wisdom, Deuteronomy. 4.6. and
the contrary, Jer. 8.9. See like exts, Deuteronomy. 29.29. Eccles. 12.13. Psalm.
111.10. Prove. 1.7. and 9.10. with the Notes.

CHAP. XXIX. Verse 1. Moreover Job continued his Parable.]
OR, his sentence, as Tremellius renders it, his sententious and elegant
oration, his aur^um flumen orationis, Tota oration gravissimis sententiis, and
verborum luminibus illustris est. Merlin.
golden flood of grave discourse, as we may better call it, then Tully did
Aristotle's ^^l^^cks. Here Job describes graphically his former felicity as in
the next Chapter his present misery. The promise of Prosperity to Gods people
is to be understood with exception of the cross, wherewith, if need be, (1 Pet.
1.6.) they are sure to be exercised (and they shall take it for a favor too,
Heb. 12.6.) by the armor of righteousness on the right hand, and on the left;
By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report, etc. 2 Cor. 6.7, 8.
they must learn to be abased, and to abound, Vlpian.
to be full and to be hungry, etc. Phil. 4.12. though this be an hard lesson,
Perquam durum est? sed it a lex scri^ta est, says the Civilian: Hard or not
hard, Ex praeteritavum voluptatum recordatione. Cicer. de finib. l. 2. Sen. de
benef l. 4 c. 22. -- Olim hac meminisse juvahit. Virg. Miserum est suisse
faelicem. Sen.
we must frame to it, and hope for better. The Epicures held, that a man might
be cheerful amidst the most exquisite torments: 1. In consideration of his
honesty and integrity: this indeed was Job great comfort, as we see chap. 31.
And, 2. In consideration of those pleasures and delights that formerly he had
enjoyed, and now cheared up himself with the remembrance of. But how slight and
slender a comfort this was, Job sets forth in this Chapter. And who knows
not that as it is a sweet thing in prosperity to relate what hazards and
hardship we have passed through: so in adversity it is grievous to call to
mind what better days we have had? And yet it is but reason, that we should
eat the crust and crum together; receive, I mean, evil at the hand of God as
well as good, Job 2.10. See the Note on chap. 27.1.

Verse 2. Secundum menses antiquitati^ vel antiaetatis.
Oh that I were as in months pust] O mihi praeteritos, etc. Though Job desires
not so much to be young again, (which to be, Chiron and Cato are said seriously
to have refused) as to prosper again; for this is that we all covet: but we
shrink in the shoulder, when called to carry the cross. To show his earnest
desire, he redoubleth his wish, as in the days, etc. and God answered him to
the full, by redoubling upon him his former prosperity; not for days and
months, but for diverse years together: and by giving him again all things
richly to enjoy: So liberal is the Lord to his, that he many times gives them
more then heart can wish.

When God preserved me] That he acknowledged God to be the author of his
earthly felicity, was well done: but not so well to think that God preserved
him not, because he prospered him not: see the like verse 5. God often wraps
himself up in a cloud, and will not be seen till afterward; but his hand is
ever upon all them for good, that seek him, Ezekiel. 8.22. he knows their souls
in adversity, Psalm 31.7.

Verse 3. When his candle shined upon my head] When I was apparently blessed by
him, and all went hail well with me. The Sun smot me not by day, nor the Moon
by night, Psalm. 121.6. but both seemed to be made, and to make for me. Nay,
more; the sweet sunshine of Gods loving countenance was displayed upon me,
which is not like the winter-sun, that casts a goodly countenance when it
shines, but gives little comfort and heat. Job had both counsel and comfort
from God; and that when other men were to seek of both: for,

By his light I walked through darkness] Without the least fear of those evils
and miseries, that put others into very great distemper. So Noah was -- Mediis
tranquillus in undis. Abraham stands upon the Hill, and sees the Cities of the
Plain burning. David can walk (not step,) through (not cross,) the valley (not
a dark entry.) of the shadow of death (the darkest side of death,) and not fear
(though he should go back again the same way.) And why? for thou art with me,
says he, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me, Psalm. 23.4.

Verse. 4. As I was in the days of my youth] Hybernorum meorum, so Junius; As
I was in the days of my winter quarters, when I lay and did little more then
gather up mine assignations. Others render it, As I was in the days of mine
Autumue: that is, when, being a great man, I refreshed the poor, as Autumn
does the passenger and others with its fruits. But they do best that render it
days of my youth, which has the same name in Hebrew with winter, (...)
and with reproach; because (say some) young people are prone to reproachful
practices, and that age is commonly frozen in vice, no virtue then springing or
showing it self. So Eccles. 11.10. the word used to signify youth, signifies
darkness or blackness: to note that youth is the dark age, many times sooted
with sin: and therefore young men should cleanse their ways by cleaving to the
word, Psalm. 119.9.

When the secret of God was upon my tabernacle] i.e. Annotat. Diod
When God did so friendly and familiarly intermedle with mine affairs: making
them to prosper. When his most wise conduct did govern my house, and did
provide for it; stopping those secret leaks, and that hole in the bottom of the
Bag, by which other men's Estates do usually run out: and supplying me and mine,
tanquam virgula divina, with all things necessary for life and godliness. The
Greek has it, when God gave my house a visit. And some taking the secret of
God here, for his law and covenant, say, that Job was good betime: and when but
a young housekeeper, had a Church in his house, and much resort thither of
godly people.

Verse 5. When the Almighty was yet with me] To prosper me, and give me all
that heart could wish, or need require. But if that be not done, Exodus 17.7.
Gods people are apt to think him absent. Is the Lord amongst us? say they in
the wilderness: as if that could not be, and they athirst. So Gideon in the
invasion of the Midianites; The Lord. says the Angel, is with thee, thou
valiant man. But Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why
then is all this befaln us? If it be so, Judge. 6.12, 13. Aug.
why am I thus? as she said, Genesis 25.22. Si amatur, quomodo infirmatur? If
Lazarus be Christ's friend. why is he sick? But these two may very well stand
together: and God is never nearer to his Children then when they for crying
cannot see him. Moses speaks of the goodwil of him that dwelt in the bush, the
burning bush, Deuteronomy. 33. but not consumed. God is with his in the fiery trial,
Isa. 43.2. as he was with the three Children, and with the Martyrs.

When my children were about me] Round about my table, Psalm 128.3. Morigerous
and obsequious unto me: When my children and servants (for the word signifies
both) were about me; as Circles about a Point or Center, all looking at, and
observing me, to do as I directed them.

Verse 6 When I washed my steps with butter] When I had of every thing Gods
plenty, as they can it. Butter enough to have washed my feet in, had I been so
proud and profuse. And Oil great store, insomuch as that Rivers thereof seemed
to flow for me from those Rocks and craggy Mountains in Arabia Petraea, where
some say Job dwelt. Lavater upon the Text, tells us of Rocks that yield Oil,
and of Petrolium or Petrelaeum, a Sovereign Ointment (very good against diverse
Diseases) that issues out of Rocks, whence also it has its name (not unlike
that berry which the French call, Vva de Spine, the Grape of a thorn:) But this
whole verse seems to be an Hyperbole, (not unlike that of Zophar, chap.
20.17. and that of Moses, Deuteronomy. 32.13. Confer Genesis 49.11. and Psalm. 80.16.)
importing the very great abundance of all outward comforts and contentments,
that Job once enjoyed. He had the reward of humility, and the fear of the Lord,
even Riches, and Honor, and Life, Prove. 22.4. Dec. D. l. 5. c. 25
Riches he had quantas optare nullus auderet, (as Austin says of Constantine
the Great) more then heart could wish. What Honor he had with his Wealth, (and
that is to be chosen before Riches, Proverbs 22.1.) he sets forth at large
in the following verses. And what long life he promised himself, not without
the continuance of both the former, see verse 18, 19, 20, with chap. 42.12, 16,
17.

Verse 7 When I went out to the gate] i.e. To the place of Judicature, called
by Solomon, the holy place, Eccles. 8.11. Because God sits in the midst of
thoss Gods, Psalm. 82.1. The Ethiopian Judges were wont to keep the chief Seat
empty for him. It appears by this Text, Isai. 5.7 Vid. Pisc in loc. Isai. 3.7
Hinc (...) ab (...), Medela. (...) Dio.
that Job was a Judge or chief Magistrate, not like those whom Esaias calls
Scabs or Wounds; but those whom the same Prophet calls Healers, or Binders up
of Wounds; and Hosea, Shields, as Junius translateth, Hos. 4.8. and another
Prophet, Heirs or Possessours of restraint, Judge. 18.7. It appears also that
he did Justice in his own person: so did David, Solomon, Jehosaphat Augustus,
Caesar, more vigorously then any young man, and more prudent then any old man,
as the Historian says of him: Which whilst Aurelian the Emperor neglected to
do, he was even bought and sold by his Deputies.

When I prepared my Seat in the street] i.e. My Judgment Seat, where he sat
Sub dio, non attollens inane supercilium, sed exhibens utile ministerium: Not
priding himself, but profiting others, whilst Justice, Justice, as Moses
speaks, that is pure Justice, Deuteronomy. 10 20.
was duly administered. Over this Tribunal might well have been set that
Distich at Zant.

Hic locus odit, amat, punit, conservat, honorat,
Nequitiam, pacem, crimina, jura, bonos.
Verse 8. The young men saw me, and hid themselves] As awed with my presence,
and fearing the censure of my gravity. Lib 5. cap. 2
Valor. Maximus reports the like of Marcus Cato among the Romans; as being Vr
irigidae innocentiae, says Livy; Et virtuti quam similimus, as Velleius has
it; that is, a most strict and very virtuous Magistrate. Hence at their
Floratia, those wanton sports, the youth could not play their pranks till he
departed; they all crying unto him, Aut vulium deponas, aut discedas, either
lay down your grave looks, or leave the place.

And the aged arose and stood up] Performing that respect to me which was due
to them, Lev. 19.32, and saluting me as the Athenians did their Phocion, by the
Title of Bonus; (...) Dio.
Or as the Romans did their Trajan, by the style of Optimus, the best Ruler
that ever they had: and all both young and old crying out, as once they did at
Rome to Severus the Emperor, All men do the better in all respects for thy
good Government. These Acclamations and public honors, though Job sought not,
yet it could not but be a comfort to him, as it was to David, that whatsoever
he did pleased the people.

Verse 9 The Princes refrained talking] Not only as acknowledging his
Authority, but as admiring his great Eloquence, and hanging upon his lips, as
the babe does upon the breast, the Be upon the flower, or the little bird upon
her Dams bill.

And laid their hand on their mouth] Kissing their hands and adoring me (
adorare est applicare manuns ad os) Or rather, as stopping their mouths, being
ashamed to speak in his presence, whom they knew to be far beyond them in
wisdom and elocution. Now of this honor done Job by all sorts of people,
Brentius has this Note, Parum est ingentes camelos possidere, etc. It is a
small matter, that Job had many Camels and Flocks of sheep: this was a greater
blessing of God upon him, that he was honored and observed by all sorts. This
follows virtue (as the shadow does the body) at the heels. To do worthily in
Ephrata, is the way to be famous in Bethlehem, Ruth 4.11.

Verse 10. The Nobles held their peace] The Hebrew word for Nobles, signifies
such as stand in the presence of great Princes; or, such as the people eyeth
and refers all things to them. These (after the example of those
forementioned Princes, verse 9) Held their peace] Heb. Hid their voice,
Conticuere omnes, intentique ora tenchant. Virg. Dr. Hall.
as ashamed to hear themselves speak before such a Master of speech, as Job
was; of whom it might well be said, as once of Dr. Whitaker, That never any man
saw him without reverence, nor heard him without wonder.

And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth] Ex metu loquendi, as
being afraid before me, though themselves were Antecessores vocis (as some
render the former words) eloquent men and able Speakers. Demosthenes that great
Orator, being to speak before King Philip, three several times stood
speechless, (...) Chiliad. 7
and thirty several times forgot what he had prepared to speak unto him. An
awful respect to Jobs dignity and worth, caused this extreme silence in these
Grandees. And besides, it may be they were of Plinyes mind, who said, Non minus
interdum Oratoris est tacere quam dicere. There is a time to keep silence, and
a time to speak, Eccles. 3.7.

Verse 11. When the ear heard me, then it blessed me.] That is, it praised me,
and praised God for me, as for a common blessing: so weighty were my words, and
so just my sentence, not unlike that of the Areopagites in Athens, which was so
upright, that none could ever say, That he was unjustly condemned by them; but
both parties, as well those that were cast, as they that cast them, (...)
were alike contented.

And when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me] Job (though he neither sought
it, nor was puffed up with it) had that Pulchrum monstrari, and dicier Hic est.
(...).
The like happiness befell Demosthenes at Athens, and Pliny at Rome.

Verse 12. Because I delivered the poor that cryed] Here are set forth the true
causes of that great respect that was generally given Job: he was a good
Justicer, such as Jethro describes, Exodus 18.21. He hated, much more then did
Mithridates, such as maliciously persecuted Virtue forsaken of fortune. And as
James 5 of Scotland was called, The poor man's King, so might Job well have
been: for no sooner could a poor body cry to him for help, but he relieved him,
Cassiodor
and rescued him out of the hands of his oppressor. Theodorick of old, and
Gustavus King of Swedes of late, are famous for so doing. Mr. Clark.


And the fatherless, and him that had none, etc.] The fatherless, and
friendless, from whom he could not expect any reward. He was not of those who
follow the administration of Justice as a trade only, with an unquenchable and
unconscionable desire of gain, but held out a constant course of integrity, and
righted those whom others would have slighted.

Verse 13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me] Such poor
creatures as were destined to destruction, and seasonably delivered by my
means, gave me their good words and wishes; yea, they cried me up for their
gracious Deliverer, with a Courage, as the Grecians did Flaminius the Roman
General, as the Christian Captives did Hunniades, Plut. Turk Hist. Val. Max.
Christ 41
who had set them at liberty from Turkish slavery: as the drowning man pulled
out of the water by King Alphonsus, cried, Arragon, Arragon: and as the Italian
prisoners in 88, released and sent home by Queen Elizabeth, Sainted her, and
said, That although they were Papists, yet they would worship no Saint but her.

And I caused the widows heart to sing for joy] scil. By ready righting her
upon her Adversary; and this out of conscience of duty, and not for her
importunity, as that unjust Judge, Luke 18.5. or because she conjured him to
it, as that widow did Adrian the Emperor, to whom, when he had answered, That
he was not at leisure to hear her Cause, Dio in Adrian.
she boldly replied, (...), Then lay down the Empire. Whereupon he turned
again, and did her right, and sent her away a joyful woman.

Verse 14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me] It was not ambition,
popularity or self-interest, that put Job upon these and the following good
practices and proceedings, ^omem horum officiorum aperit Merlin.
but the care he had of discharging his trust, and the pure love he bare to
Justice and upright dealing. For although he desired more to be loved then
honored (as it is said of Trajan the Emperor,) yet he would not do any thing
of popularity or partiality, (...) Dio. Declinatione and detorsione judicii.
Merlin.
by writhing or warping, but retained the gravity of the Law; which is a heart
without affection, an eye without Lust, a mind without passion, a Treasurer
which keeps for every man what he has, and distributeth to every man what he
ought to have. Job did put on righteousness, and it put on him; so the Hebrew
has it. By which similitude he declares, that he could as little be drawn
from doing Justice, as he could go abroad without his clothes, or suffer them
to be pulled off him.

My judgment was as a robe and a Diadem] Righteousness is that whereby the
innocent is delivered, Judgment is that whereby the guilty person is punished,
says Brentius. With these was Job arrayed and adorned, far better then was
Alcist henes the Sybarite with his cloak, Athenaus.
sold by Dionysius to the Carthaginians for an hundred and twenty talents; or
Hanun with his massy Diadem, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the
precious stones, 2 Samuel 12.30. Some Judges have nothing more to commend them
then their Robes, which are often lined with rapine and robbery: So were not
Jobs: He made the like use of them that old Eleazer did of his hoarinesse, he
would not do any thing that might seem to be evil, because he would not spot
his white head: No more would Job, lest he should stain his purple, disgrace
his Diadem. Salvian.
He knew that dignitas in indigno est ornamentum in luto, Ruledom without
righteousness is but eminent dishonor.

Verse 15 I was eyes to the blind] Here he says the same in effect as before,
verse. 12, 13. Mercer.
only he sets it forth Pulcherrimis allegoriis per synathroismum velut
conglobatis, by a heap of most elegant allegories. He means here, I gave
advice to the simple, and support to the weak and impotent. But how many great
men are there, qui etiam videntes, circumveniunt and fallunt, who put out the
eyes of men, as Korah falsely accused Moses, Numb. 16.14. And cut off their
legs (as that Tyrant in the Story served his Guests that were too long for his
bed) by disabling or discouraging them to follow their just causes, so that
they are ready to say with Themistecles, that if two ways were showed him,
Plut.
whereof the one led to hell, and the other to those corrupt courses of
Justice, he would seriously choose the former rather then the latter.

Verse 16. I was a father to the poor] Ab lacbionim, an elegant agnomination,
as Mercer here notes. Job was not only a friend to the poor as aforesaid, but
a father providing for their necessitites, Sue^.
and protecting them from injuries. So Augustus. Caesar delighted to be called,
Pater Patriae, the Father of his Country. And our Queen Elizabeth would many
times say that she could believe nothing of her people, Cambden. Eliz.
that parents would not believe of their children.

And the cause which I knew not I sought out] Sifting it to the bran, and not
pronouncing sentence till I had fully understood each circumstance of the
controversy. Judge not according to the appearance, but judge a righteous
judgment, John 7.24. Thucydides well says, That there are two things most
opposite to right proceedings, (...), Haste and Anger; A Justicer must do
nothing rashly, but with greatest deliberation and industry, to come to a right
understanding of matters, in capital causes especially, lest he repent it too
late: as that Sir James Pawlet did, who out of humor and for revenge, laid by
the heels Thomas Wolsey, Negotiat. of Card. Wolsey.
then a Country Minister (afterward a Cardinal, and Lord Chancellor of
England,) for the which he suffered long imprisonment. And as that Judge
mentioned by Fortescue, who having condemned a Gentlewoman to death for the
murder of her husband, upon the bare accusation of her man, which afterward
was found false, saepius ipse mihi falsus est. He afterward confessed unto me,
says the Author, that he should never during his life be able to clear his
conscience of that Fact. We know what pains Solomon took in the case of the
two harlots that strove before him. And we have read of a Judge, who to find
out a Murder, caused those that were accused to open their bosoms, and felt
the beating of their hearts. And when he found one of their hearts to beat
extraordinarily, Tu, inquit, fecisti; Thou art the Murderer certainly, said
he. The man presently confessed the fact, Job. Manl. loc. com.page 290
and was executed for it.

Verse 17. And I brake the jaws of the wicked] It is a mercy to have Judges,
says One, Modo audeant quaesentiunt, as the Orator has it: so they dare do
as their consciences tell them they should do. Job was such a Judge, Cic. pro
Milom.
he feared not to encounter and keep under those unruly Beasts and Belialists,
who oppressed the poor, and then doubted not to oppose with crest and breast
whatsoever stood in the way of their humors and lusts, Hic forti magnoque
animo opus fuit, says One: Here Jobs courage was put to the proof, if ever. Is
it nothing to break the Jaw-bones of the wicked, to take the prey out of the
Lions mouth, and to rescue the oppressed from the man that is too mighty for
him? Is it nothing to encounter the Hydra of sin, to oppose the current of
times and torrent of vice, to turn the wheel over the wicked, and to leave them
as powerless as old Entellus in Virgil did Dares; whom his fellows led away
well beaten, and well nigh broken, Jactantemque utroque caput, Virg. Aeneid.
crassumque cruorem
Ore rejectantem, mistosque in sanguine dentes?


And plucked the spoil out of his teeth.] i.e. I made him make restitution of
his ill gotten goods, whether by fraud or force. So that Jobs Court, we see,
was not vitiorum sentina, sed virtutum Officina; his course was, Parcere
subjectis, and debellare superbos, to fuccour the afflicted, and to punish the
proud. (...) Dio.
Augustus the Emperor was wont to say, That such an one only was fit to be a
Magistrate, that was free from foul offense himself, and could withstand the
corruptions of the times, keep a constant countermotion to the evil manners of
the multitude: as Cato was ever inveying against covetousness and riot in the
Roman State. Here also we have in Job the lively picture of a good Magistrate,
much better then that of Caesar Borgia, that Villain, De Principe P. 185
whom Machiavel proposes as the only pattern for Princes to imitate.

Verse 18. Then I said, I shall dye in my nest] Heb. I shall expire and breath
out my last, by a natural death in my house, and amidst my people; as a bird
dies in his nest when he has lived his utmost. Pollicebar mihi securitatem; I
promised my self a prosperous and long life, all health and happiness. Brent.
This some make to be a fault in Job, as it was likewise in David, when in his
prosperity he said, I shall never be moved. Psalm. 30.6. And indeed the holiest
hearts are apt in such a strait to grow proud and secure: like as worms and
wasps eat the sweetest apples and fruits. But others are of judgment, That
this was a commendable confidence in Job. grounded upon Gods Promises, and the
conscience of his own uprightness; an (...), a spiritual security, a blessed
calm and composedness, a Sabbath of Spirit, flowing from faith, and causing
joy. This was all well, only that of Bernard must be carefully heeded and held
to, Laeti simus non securi, gaudentes in Spiritu sancto, sed tamen caventes a
recidivo. Be merry we may, but not carnally secure; rejoicing in the Holy
Ghost, but yet beware that we backslide not. David by misreckoning of a point
missed the Haven, and ran upon the Rocks, Psalm. 30. And Job here seems to
have been mistaken, by taking the promises of outward happiness with out
exception of the cross; for the which he is afterward reproved by Elihu, and
also by God himself.

And Shall multiply my days as the sand] i.e. Very long, by a Scripture
hyperbole, Genesis 22.17. and 32.12. and 41.49. The Septuagint read, As the
Phoenix: The Vulgar Latin, as the Palm Tree, which is reckoned among the long
lived trees, as is likewise the Phoenix among the longest lived creatures. R.
Solomon says he lives a thousand years, others five hundred, and then dies
in his nest, made of Frankincense and Myrrh, and other sweet Odours, which
being kindled by the heat of the Sun, he is burnt to ashes, they say: out of
which ashes, a long time after, comes another Phoenix. How true all this of
the Phoenix is, I have not to say. Let them that will, read more in Gesners
History of Birds: or let them look upon Lactantius his Poem called the Phoenix,
with Betuleius his Comment.

Verse 19. My root was spread out by the waters] Heb. Opened to the waters;
which therefore had free recourse to it, and much refreshed it. Hereby he
describes his flourishing condition when time was, through the perpetual
inflowings of Gods free Grace and favor.

And the dew lay all night upon my branch] Pernectabat; because in the night
the dew falls. Beza thus Paraphraseth this whole verse: For, downward the
root of my good and upright conscience was spread out by the everflowing waters
of Gods bountifulness, with which it was daily watered: and upward, the boughs
growing out of this root, to wit, my children, my servants, my flocks of sheep,
and in a word, my substance, were washed with the celestial dew which from
heaven fell down upon them: so that by this blessing of God they were
marvellously increased.

Verse 20. My glory was fresh in me] i.e. I had daily new accessions to mine
honors: and I was herein like a Bay Tree that is always green. This was also
Joseph's happiness in Egypt; David in the Court of Saul; Mordecai's and Daniels
in the Court of Persia; and Queen Elizabeth's; concerning whom (besides that
famous Epitaph set upon her Tomb by command of King James) Thuanus a French
Historian testifies, that the Lady Anna Atestina (Mother to the Guises and
Nemours) pronounced her to be Glorio^^ssimam and omnium quae unquam sceptrum
gestarunt felicissimam (...), The most glorious and happiest Woman that ever
swayed Scepter. Among her Subjects the got a continual increase of honor and
respects, by coupling mildness with Majesty, and stooping yet in a stately
manner, to the meanest sort: but especially by setting up God and his sincere
Service, wherever she had to do, trusting God with her precious life, (so much
sought for by Popish Assassinates;) which whiles her Contemporary Henry 4. of
France durst not do, he loft his life, and much of his honor: witness that
known Anagram, Borbonius, once Bonus orbi, now Orous boni.

And my bow was renewed in my hand] That is, I had fresh and new supplies of
strength, Robur meum instaurabi^ur masusque reddetur. Vatab.
by friends and otherwise outwardly and inwardly, according to that above,
Chap. 17.9. The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that has clean
hands shall be stronger and stronger. See Genesis 49.24. 1 Samuel 2.4.

Verse 21. Unto me men gave ear, and waited] i.e. Such a gift I had in
flexanimous Oratory, that my Auditors were held as it were by the ears in
great attention to my speeches: as Lucian says of Alcibiades, and Cicero of
Crassus: and as the Poets fable of their Hercules, that he had the ears of his
hearers chained to his tongue, as being, (...) Hom.


And kept silence at my counsel] Received it as an Oracle from Heaven with all
humble submission. Tanquam ex tripode dictum. Erant (...) Lavat.
and plenary satisfaction: so great was the force of his wisdom, the weight of
his counsel, and the authority of his person. In some men's discourses a man
shall have sat^ el quentiae, sapientiae parum, much eloquence little enough
wisdom. But where there is a concurrence of these two, as was in Job, much may
be done. This, great men are not ignorant of, and do therefore greatly covet
eloquence, Non phaleraram illam sed fortem; non effoeminatam sed vi^ilem, non a
Pedantike style or phrase, but majestic: such as was that of Phocion a great
Orator, but one that could speak much in few, (...) Plut.
as Plutarch reports: or that of Julius Caesar, who wrote as he fought; and
whom a man might know to be a Soldier by his words, had he never heard of his
noble achievements.

Verse 22. After my words they spoke not again] They replied not, but rested in
my words, as if I had been some Doctor Resolutus, or rather Irrifragubilis. The
vulgar renders it, Verbis meis addere nihil audebant; they durst not add any
thing to my words as holding them current and sufficient.

And my speech dropped upon them] Viz. As dew-drops, Deuteronomy. 32.2. or as some
Prophecy, says R. Levi here. Confer, Mic 2.6. Am. 6.17. Surely as the dew
refreshes and cherishes the dry and fady fields; so do fit words the hearts
of the hearers. And as the dew allayeth great heats, and moisteneth the earth,
that it may fructify; so it is here. Ille regit dictis animos, and pectora
(...). And lastly, Virg.
as the dew lies in a little compass; so in fewness of words there is often a
fullness of matter, etc.

Verse 23. And they waited for me as for the rain] Which in those hot Countries
was highly prized, and dearly longed for.

And they opened their mouth wide] Stupebant, me loquente, and ere blabant;
They gaped, as if they would have eaten my words: they listened as for life.

As for the latter rain] A rain which came very seldom in that Country, says
Diodate; but was much desired for the refreshing and nourishing of the corn and
other fruits and benefits of the earth, Prove. 26.1. Zach. 10.1. Merlin
collecteth from this text, that Job came not into the public Assemblies there
to speak, and g^ve counsel, but upon deliberate premeditation. Demosthenes
would not be drawn to speak extempore to an Audience. Aristides being by the
Emperor put upon such a task, answered, Propound to day, and I will answer to
morrow: (...) S^e his life by Mr Clark.
for I am not of those that spet or vomit out my conceptions; but of those that
weigh things before I utter them, and polish before I publish them. Mr.
Bradshaw was called the Weighing Divine: and Melancthon took time to Answer
Eckius his cavils; though by him, and his Popish-party, he was jeared for so
doing. It must be an elaborate speech that shall persuade or prevail much.
Among the Roman, the Prince was not to be treated with, otherwise than by
writing. Caesar brought in this custom, that he might have time to consider of

lest he should say more or less than that he thought of.

Verse 24. If I laughed on them, they believed it not] They took it for a great
favor, and could hardly think that I would grace them so far as to smile upon
them, or jest with them: which if I did at any time, they were over-joyed.
Eccles. 10.19. Prove. 29.9. De Orat. lib. 2.
Ingeni fractus tennissimus est risus, says Tully. To break a jest is no such
witty thing, as men conceit it. Howbeit, an harmless jest (that has nothing in
it which may justly grieve or offend another) may very well consist with Piety
and Christian gravity, whatever some sour Anabaptists have held to the
contrary. Jocularity indeed and scurrility are flatly forbidden; and reckoned
among those (...), things that conduce not to the main end of our lives, Ephesians.
5 4. But Socrates would be very merry when he liked his company; yet so as that
his mirth should be some way profitable, says Xenophon. And Erasmus did the
Papists more prejudice by his jesting, says a grave Author, than Luther did by
his stomaching and storming. Lib 4 de dic. and fact. Socr.
Good men's jests should have something in them of seriousness and usefulness.
All their speeches should be seasoned with falt of grace: and in the midst of
their recreations they should show, that their best affections are upon better
things. Great care must be taken, that too much familiarity with those below
us, breed not contempt; which some think is meant by the next clause, And the
light of my countenance they cast not down; Or, Tet the light, etc. that is,
they did not slight me because of this familiar carriage; they did not
therefore count me ridiculous and vain: as men did that Rodulphus the 35.

unbeseeming the gravity of his age and place, they surnamed, or rather
nicknamed, Nugax, the Trister: Sed authoritatem m^am non spernehant,
nihilominus me reverebantur; Vatab.
They despised not mine authority; they reverenced me no whit the less: but
rather they took care that nothing might be done whereby of merry I might be
made sad: they cherished this sign of complacency in me as a rare thing, and
so much the more accepted, as less expected and unusual: neither would they be
so bold and so bob with me, as to return me jest for jest, as if I had been
their compeer, and hail fellow well met. One Paraphrast senseth the whole verse
thus; If I by my smiles gave any intimation of any report or business, Mr.
Abbot.
it was presently distrusted and dissented from of all the rest. And on the
other hand; my least countenance or show of approbation to any cause was
observed of others, as a rule to go by. He goes on to give the meaning of the
next words thus:

Verse 25. I chose out their way, and sat chief] In those days I was the
only man in all matters, chosen by consent of all to be the Prolocutour, and
advanced to the first place in all Assemblies and places of Judicature etc.
Tremellius, and others, read it thus, If I chose their way. (that i^, If of
mine own accord, I came unto them at any time) I sat chief, and was Chairman:
in a word, I dwelt as a King amidst his Troopers, when he comfort them being
cast down; that is, when after some defeat or disappointment, he cheereth up
their spirits by his speeches, and cries, Courage my hearts: Flebile
principium, melior fortuna sequatur:
Victorem a victo superari saepe videmus.
The Tigurines render the former part of the verse thus, Accommodam me illorum
moribus cum judicio, I fitted my self to their fashions, yet with discretion.
R. Solomon and others thus, They asked me, What way shall we go? What course
take? And I chose out their way, and set them down a course; as a Counselor
does to his Clyents, a King to his Soldiers, or a Casuist those that resort to
him for comfort.

And dwelt as a King in the army] Where he is continually surrounded by his
soldiers, and highly honored. The Bees, in their Commonwealth, have a King,
whose Palace they frame as fair in show, as strong in substance: if they find
him fall, they stablish him again in his Throne with all duty, with all
devotion: they guard him continually for fear he should miscarry, for love he
should not. Job had so tempered and mixed gravity and lenity, he had so
fourbished the sword of Justice with the Oil of Mercy, that he was at once
both feared as a King, and loved as a Comforter.

As one that comfort the mourners] That mourn for the loss of some dear
thing or person, as the word signifies: and especially, for the loss of Gods
favor, as Zach. 12.10. groaning under the sense of sin, and fear of wrath. Now
to comfort such mourners in Sion, is as difficult a work as to raise the dead,
says Luther; and scarce one of a thousand can skill of it, Job 33.23. Every
Christian should have feeding lips. and an healing tongue, to comfort the
feeble-minded, to drink to them in a cup of Nepenth^s, that cup of consolation,
Jer: 16.7. taking them down into Christ's Wine-cellar, Cant. 2.4. and there stay
them with Flagons, and comfort them with Apples, verse 5. those Apples of the
garden of Eden, (as the Chaldee there has it) the sweet and precious Promises,
which are pabulum fidei, the food of Faith, and do give the joy of faith; even
that peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them that have been in a low and
lost condition. But this, few can do to purpose; because they are either
unskilful in the word of truth, or unexperienced; they dig not their discourses
out of their own breasts, they utter them more from their brains, than from
their bowels, from their own experience I mean; which made even Christ himself
a more compassionate High Priest, Heb. 5. And that eminent servant of his, St.
Paul, had by this means got an excellent faculty in comforting the
disconsolate, Melancthon.
2 Cor. 1.4. So had Luther, as having himself from his tender years been much
beaten and exercised with spiritual conflicts. Conceive we may the like of Job,
who was therefore flocked unto from far and near, as known to be able to time a
word, and to speak to the hearts of drooping and dejected persons. But now, etc.

CHAP. XXX. Verse 1 But now they that are younger than I, have me in derision]
ID quod ei morbo suo long gravius fuerit, sicut and Hebraei testantur, says
Mercer. This troubled him much more than all his sores and sicknesses; that
every young shackrag slighted him, and laughed him to scorn. In this case
especially, -- Faciles motus men's generosa capit. Ovid.
You shall find some, says Erasmus, that if death be threatened, can despise
it: but to be despised or belyed, they cannot brook; but least of all by base
persons: Qui^zbet ab aquila quam corvo discerpi mavnl^. Job was now grown
ancient, Cognate sunt (...)
and had been honorable, as he had set forth chap. 29. Old Age and Honor, in
the Greek tongue, are near a kin: and, Summa fuit quondam capitis reverentia
cani:
Inque suo precio ruga senilis erat.
But it is a sign of gasping devotion, and that things are far out of order,
when the Child behaveth himself proudly against the ancient, and the base
against the honorable, Esa. 3.5. as at Bethel, where those ill-bred Children
derided the old Prophet, and petulantly cried after him. Go up thou baldhead,
go up thou baldhead, 2 King. 2.23. If the like unworthy usuage befall us, let it
suffice us that our betters, Job. David. Christ himself have sped no better.
Art not thou glad to fare as Phocion? said he to a meaner man, that was to die
with him.

Whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my stock]
i.e. To have made my dog-keepers, that they might feed with them as the
prodigal son did with the swine. Dogs are commonly looked upon as paltery
carrion Creatures: only some, for their minds sake, and others for certain
necessary uses, as shepherds, and hunters, make some reckoning of them: It was
not permitted to a dog to (...) into the Acropolis, or tower of Athens, for his
libidinousness and ill-favour. (...) Plut. (...) p. 175.
At Rome they crucified a dog yearly, in detestation of those dogs in the
Capitol that gave not warning of the approach of an Enemy. Job, it seems, had
his dog-feeders; men of meanest account. Now these men's sons, a beggarly breed,
and very rascals, insulted and trampled opon this precious man, dealt as basely
and coursely with him, happily, as those fictious fellows in Geneva did with
reverend Calvin; whom they not only in contempt called Cain (as Athanasius was
sometimes by his enemies called Sathanasius: and Cyprian, Cyprian; that is, a
dunghil-fellow) but also named their Dogs Calvin, as Beza in his life reports.

Verse 2. Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me?] For, to
say the truth, (thus Beza here paraphraseth) the strength of those young
striplings could not have stood me in any stead at all: and as for the old age
of their fathers, it were such, that having spent the greatest and best part of
their life partly in idleness, and partly in diverse wicked and lewd pranks,
they might worthily seem to have lived in vain, all that while: Thus he. The
Greeks say, (...), and the Latins Juniores ad labores, young men are fit for
hard labor, because strong and lusty. But these Sanniones in the text were,
through idleness, meat nullities in the world, superfluities in the earth,
Jeremies rotten girdle, good for nothing but to devour victuals: vermin, apes,
monkeys, their whole life was to eat and drink (when they could come by it) and
sleep, and sport, and flear, and jear at Gods afflicted, with words as full of
scorn as profane wit or rancour'd malice can make them. (...) settuag.
These are excrements in humane society Pests, the scripture styles them,
Psalm. 1.1.

In whom old age was perished] Their fathers also were old dottrels, in ipsa
senectute senectute carentes, old, but not wise; like the Brabanti, Noriae
Encom.
who are said to be the elder the foolisher. Some men live long, but are good
for little. Non ille din vixit, sed din fuit, says Seneca of somebody; He has
not lived long, but only been long: as a ship in a storm, he has been tossed
much, but sailed nothing. Those old men who have not gotten wisdom by long
experience, are not worthy of their years, their old age is perished, and their
honor forfeited: The vulgar renders it, They were reckoned unworthy of life
it self: Depontani.

Verse 3. For want and famine, they were solitary] Miserably poor they were,
and nittily needy: scarce having a rag to their backs, and therefore ashamed to
show themselves in company of others, propter penuriam, and propter esuriem,
they lurked in by-corners, and seldom came abroad, unless it were when hard
hunger drove the Wolf out of the wood. Slow-bellies they had ever been, and
evil beasts, fitter therefore to live in the Wilderness, in former time
desolate and waste, than in a civil society: or if in any place, at
Poneropolis, a City built by Philip King of Macedony, for varlets and vagrants,
and with such kind of persons peopled; that they might not pester other places.
Job would have none such about him: and was therefore, happily, now in his low
condition, so much hated and affronted by them.

In former time desolate and waste] And so perhaps haunted by the Devil, as
Isa. 13.20, 21. Brentius renders it, Hesternam pressuram and consternationem,
yesterdayes pressures, and fright; that is, says he, The Creditors eagerness
to be satisfied, which frighteth these caytiffs, and puts them to their
shifts.

Verse 4. Who cut up Mallows by the bushes] Pitiful poor fare they are glad of:
not so good as that of the Baptist, Locusts and wild Honey. Mat. 3. but
Mallows, which, together with Asphodelus, Hesiod mentions as poor folks fare.
Tremellius renders it, Herbas e salsilagine cum stirpibus, salt, and bitter
herbs and stalks a Brentius renders it, Nettles: Some take it for Samphire,
which is a kind of Sea-mallows or Sea-purslain. The Hebrew word comes from
another, that signifies salt; and sounds like the Latin Malva, Ut famem
qu^quo modo sedarent. Merc.
and the English Mallows. Course and homely Provision the wretches were glad to
make use of, to appease the cruel hunger that devoured them. And this has been
sometimes the case of better men; as of those Worthies, who wandered in
deserts, and in mountains, in dens and caves of the earth, Heb. 11.38. The Duke
of Lorraine had proscribed some thousands of his Protestant subjects, who were
thereby forced to seed upon leaves of trees and grass of the fields, till the
Senate of Strasbrough, overcome by the importunity of their Divines, took them
in, Sculset. Annal.
and relieved them, till they could be otherwise provided for. In the late Wars
of Germany, people were found dead in the highways with grass in their
mouths, perishing for want of better food.

And Juniper roots for their meat] These, though they surpass all other in
bitterness, were their ordinary food. Our forefathers, as they colored their
bodies with Woad, (and were therefore called Picts) this was their fine
clothes: so their food was barks of trees, and roots, say our Chroniclers. Is
not the matter well amended with us? and should we not serve the Lord with
joyfulness in the abundance of all things, Deuteronomy. 28.47. Lavater thinks, That
these poor people for a living dug up Juniper-roots, and sold them to others
for the use of perfuming.

Verse 5. They were driven forth from amongst men] E corpore, says Tremellius,
out of the Body; that is, out of the Community, as not fit to live in a
Commonwealth. The Jews are, for their inexpiable guilt, banished out of the
world, as it were by a common consent of Nations. Out of England they were
exiled for ever by King Edward the First, anno 1290. Out of France, 1307. Out
of Spain, 1492. Portugal, 1597. Naples and Sicily, 1539. In Turkey they pay for
the very heads they wear: but in Cyprus if a Jew be taken (though driven
thither by tempest) he is put to death immediately. Country they have none,
nor Restingplace any where. In Jerusalem there are not to be found, at this
time, as hundred houshoulds of them: Indeed in Constantinople and Thessalonica,
there are esteemed to be about 160000. Breerwoods enquiries.

derided, and buffetted him. All this, and more they suffer; and yet they
continue, by a just judgment of God, upon them, woefully hard-hearted,
blood-thirsty, theevish, treacherous, flagitious. Howbeit there is a remnant
according to the Election of Grace, Romans 11.5. Anno Dom. 1536. at Weissensten
in Germany, a Jew for theft (they had cried after him with Hue and cry, as
after a thief) was in this cruel manner to be executed: He was hanged by the
feet with his head downward, betwixt two dogs, which constantly snatched and bit
at him. The strangeness of the torment moved Jacob Andreas (a grave Divine) to
go to behold it: Coming thither, he found the poor wretch, as he hung,
repeating verses out of the Hebrew psalms, wherein he cried out to God for
mercy. Andreas hereupon took occasion to counsel him to trust in Jesus Christ,
Melch. Adam in viz.
the true Savior of mankind. The Jew embracing the Christian Faith, requested
but this one thing, That he might be taken down, and be baptized, though
presently after he were hanged again, (but by the neck, as Christian
malefactors suffered) which was accordingly granted him.

They cried after them, as after a thief] Presuming that, by doing nothing,
they had learned to do naughtily: and that having nothing of their own, and not
willing to work, they lived by rapin and robbery. Such therefore as these they
served as Philip of Macedony did a couple of his idle (and therefore evil)
subjects; he made the one of them run out of the Country, and the other drive
him. Solon made a law at Athens, that every man once a year should show the
Magistrates by what Art or Trade he maintained his Family. This if he could not
do to their good liking, Melanct.
he was presently expelled the City. At Corinth also, Periander ordained, That
if any man spent freely, and could not make it appear that he got it honestly,
he should without further process of law, be trussed up for a thief.

Verse 6. To dwell in the clifts of the vallies] Like wild beasts and
Serpents: which these idle persons will rather choose to do, and suffer any
hardship, then labor for their livings, and do good in their places; earning
it before they eat, and contributing something to the weal-publick, as Bees
bring their honey to the common hive: This, those that will not do, are
worthily cast-out, and made to dwell in the clifts, etc. In the time of Cato
Censorius. when any one would be a Citizen of Rome, they took his hand betwixt
theirs; and if it felt smooth and soft, they presently as an idle vagabond,
gave him his Mi^timus: but if hard and knotty, they forth with admitted him to
dwell in their City. And if a malefactor were apprehended whose hands were
laboring hands, his punishment should be mitigated, though his Crime were
grievous: as if otherwise, a severe punishment was inflicted for a light
offense.

Verse 7. Among the bushes they brayed] Through grief and discontent at their
low condition and many miseries; which yet they would rather bootlesly bewail,
than take a right course to remedy. They lust and have not, they kill
(themselves through idleness,) and desire to have (if it would come without
labor) but cannot obtain, Jam. 4.2. And hence they bray like the wild-Ass when
empty, and roar as the Lion when hunger-bit.

Under the Nettles were gathered together] Or they were pricked, whealed, (as
we call it) Vrti^a ab urendo, they were nettle-stung, whilst they got under
those weeds for shelter and warmth. All this Job relates of those that derided
him: not to be even with them, or out of a desire to disparage them, but to
aggravate the indignity of his misusage, and to comfort himself, as Seneca in
like case did; Male de me loquuntur, sed mate; They speak evil of me: But who
are they? base persons, and wicked above measure: and, oh how easy a thing it
is to wagge a wicked tongue! especially when the devil has the doing of it, as
he has in this kind of men, Lavat.
qui revera as aperiunt, and atabolum loqui sinunt; whose mouth the Devil
borrows to vent the language of hell by.

Verse 8. They were children of fools, yea, children of base men] Homines
flagitiosissimi, etiam homines ignominiosissimi afflictissimi erant, extorres,
so Tremellius translateth; Naught all over they were, and naught esteemed: what
wonder therefore if heavily afflicted, and relegated? Their poverty was
self-procured, and therefore unpitied; they had brought themselves into the
briars, and also in their fathers iniquities they were pining away with them,
Levit. 26.39. Evil eggs they were of evil birds, ^ihili homuncimes and
ingloris, as the Tigurines translate, fellows of no fashion, and as little
account, terrae filii, earth-sprung Mushromes, men in whom all true wisdom was
faded and decayed, sapless persons Nabals, Nebulones.

They were viler then the earth] Terra quam ferimus, terra etiam quam terimus:
Or, they were smitten out of the earth, driven out of the land, sc. by me when
I was in power: but now these vile varlets show themselves again, and trample
upon me with the feet of pride and petulancy: Leoni mortuo vel mus insultat.

Verse 9. And now I am their song] They compose Comedies out of my Tragedies,
and make themselves merry in my misery; they not only make Balads and Sonnets
of my sufferings, but also play them upon their Instruments, as the Hebrew word
imports.

Yea, I am their by-word] Sermonis argumentum, the matter of their Discourse; I
am all their talk, De me confabulantur and contemptim loquuntur. Disc.
neither have they any thing else whereof to chat and babble, but only of me,
yea to make my disgraces to pass into a Proverb, they call all miserable men
by my name. The Ale-stakes served David in like sort; the Drunkards upon their
Ale-bench tossed his name as Dogs do carrion, making him their ballad and their
byword, Psalm. 69.12. The whole Church complains of the like contempt, Psalm.
79.4. Lam. 3.14, 63. Ezekiel. 33.32. Thus when the invincible Armada, as they
called it, was coming for England, Don Bernardino Mendoza, the Spanish
Ambassador in France, Cambd. Eliz.
solaced himself with a vain and false Poem or Song of Englands miseries: which
as a triumph before the victory, he absurdly printed. The Gunpowder-Traytors
also did the like in their sevenfold Psalmodie, as they called it; that
divellish ditty, which secretly the Papists passed from hand to hand with Tunes
set to be sung or played. Spec. Bell. Sacr.
The matter consisted of railing upon King Edward 6, Q. Elizabeth, K. James,
and others; of Petition, Imprecation, Prophecy, and praise.

Verse 10. They abhor me, they flee far from me] As if I were a Leper or a
Bugbear, or that my breath were infectious; like that maid spoken of by Avicen,
who feeding upon poison, was her self healthy, yet infected others with her
venomous breath. Job was wont to be honored; now he is as much abhorred.
People were used to hang upon his lips for learned counsel, but they stand
aloof off, and keep at a distance. They looked upon that face of his as the
face of an Angel, which now with utmost despite and detestation, they spit
upon and spare not. At vertutes evertere non possunt, as Demetrius Phalereus
said, when the Athenians threw down the many Statues they had once erected in
honor of him, But they cannot throw down my virtues and valiant acts, whereby
I deserved those Statues. Job was not without his cordial in this sad and
sudden change of his condition. For first, the Bird in his own bosom sang
sweetly still, as birds in the Spring tune most melodiously, when it raines
most sadly. And secondly, What if these miscreants prate against Job with
malicious words, as Diotrephes did against Demetrius, 3 John 10. Yet it is
enough for Job or Demetrius that they have a good report of all men; that is,
of all good men, who indeed are the only men (as a good name only is a name,
Eccles 7.1. and a good wife only a wife, Prove. 18.22.) to be reckoned on; and
of the truth it self, that is more, ver. 12.

And spare not to spit in my face] In signum videlicet maximi contemptus and
indignationes; Junius
In token of greatest contempt and indignation, as Numb. 12.14. Isai. 50.6.
Deuteronomy. 25.9. The face is the table of beauty or comeliness: and when it is spit
upon, it is made the seat of shame. Their words were, likely, such as the
English Barons here said of the Popes that excommunicated them, Fie on such
rascal ribaulds etc. Marcidi. ribauldi Mat. Paris.
Our Lord Christ also was spit upon in like manner, that he might cleanse our
faces from the filth of sin, and make them shine with his beams, 1 Job. 3.2.

Verse 11. Because he has loosed my cord] i.e. God has taken away mine
Authority, whereby I heretofore kept them in order, and made them more
obsequious, so that now like headstrong horses, having gotten the bit between
their teeth, they run whithersoever they list; and rise up against their Rider.
It is God who casts contempt upon Princes, Psalm. 107.40 Job 12.21.
as he did upon Solomon in his old age, upon his son Rehoboam, upon Ephraim,
Hos. 13.1. (see the Note there) upon out Edward 2, and Henry 6. Some render it,
He has loosed my Bow string, in reference to chap. 29.20. So that I cannot now
shoot at those that slight me. Job was disarmed and disabled to do as he
desired, as Philip King of France, was in the battle between him and Edw. Dan.
Hist. f 237
3. King of England, at the instant whereof there fell such a piercing shower of
rain, as dissolved the strings of his Archers, and made their Bow unuseful.

And afflicted me] When a tree is felled, each man pulls off a branch, says
the Great Proverb. When a dog is worried, every Curr will fall on him, and have
a fling at him. When a Deer is wounded, the whole Herd will set against him,
and thrust him out of their company: So when God has afflicted Job, every base
beggarly fellow sat heavy upon his skirts. This was an addition to his
affliction.

They have also let loose the Bridle upon me] Those. Insolents; having pulled
their heads out of the halter, lay the raines in the neck, and run riot; yea,
Effraenare in ^^in^ecti sunt, Jun.
they run at tilt against me, as it were, beyond all reason and measure,
without fear, shame or manners. For, Upon me, some read, Before me; q.d. Now
they dare do any thing even in my presence, who formerly stood in aw of me.

Verse 12. Upon the right hand rise the youth] Brought on reads, The
Springals. The Hebrew has it, The blossom, or the young birds the youngsters,
Vix puberes, Such as are scarce out of the shel.
the boys scoffed and abused Job. The lawless rout, riding without raines,
took a licentious boldness to despise and despite him, because he was ever
most severe against their unruly practices.

They push away my feet] They trip up my heels, as we phrase it, and lay me
along. Vide admirandam humanae sortis varietatem, faith Brentius here: i.e. See
the strange turns of humane condition. Job was wont to have the chief Seats in
the Temple, and Salutations in the Marketplace; now he cannot have a room my
where to stand in, but every paltry boy is pushing him down. May it not be said
of Job, as it was of that Emperor, that he was fortunae pila and lusus? But he
saw God in all.

And they raise up against me the way of their destruction] Allegoria
^astr^nsi, Job borrows this expression from the Camp, as he does many more
from other things, whenever he speaks of his great afflictions, and the
contempt that was cast upon him. Upon me they tread the paths of their
unhappiness, so Beza; that is, they make a path in which they may practice
that their malapert boldness in doing mischief. They beat their paths by
running up and down therein, to undo me, so Vatablus: They cast upon me the
causes of their wa^; so Broughton.

Verse 13. They mar my path] That is, all my studies and endeavors; they
obstruct all passages whereby I might hope for help, as if they were resolved
upon my ruin.

They set forward my calamity] See Zach. 1.15. see the Note there. Or they
count it profitable to them to vex me: So great is there malice against me. And
though it do them no good yet if they may do me hurt, they have enough.

They have no helper] Neither need they any to animate them, (...)
or egg them on to mischief, who of themselves are over forward, though but
small and young, as Vajezatha, Hamans youngest son was. See the Note on Esth.
9.9.

Verse 14. They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters] Quasi irruptione
lata in vedunt me. As Soldiers when they have made a breach in a wall, come
tumbling in upon the Town, and sack and ransack it, yea, raze it, and harrasse
it; so have these dealt with me.

They rolled themselves upon me] Laboring wholly to suppress me, Genesis 43.28.
Taking occasion by this my downfall, which they ought rather to have lamented
and pitied* they unmercifully fell upon me, as if themselves had lived out of
the reach of Gods rod.

Verse 15. Terrors are turned upon me] I am horribly afraid of thy judgments
as David expresses it; and this was it that pointed and put a sting into all
other sufferings, for a wounded conscience who can bear? If the shoulder be
galled, the burden will be very tedious and irksom. Be not thou a terror unto
me, Lord, says J^^^ and then I care not much what else soever befalls me.
But why were these terrors so troublesome?

They pursue my soul as the wind] Brentius renders (...) my liberality or,
They take away from me all the cheerfulness (...) of my mind; whereby
heretofore I suffered so many calamities, and shrank not; for the joy of the
Lord was my strength, and ther^ nothing (...) amiss to me. Thou has
strengthened (...) with strength in my soul, Ps;al. 38.3 and uphold me with thy
noble spirit, Psalm. 5^.12. The Chaldee has it, Kingly Spirit, and it is the
same word in the Original that is here rendered, Animaem meam nobilem and
inc^tam. Vat.
My soul: It is, my Princess, or, my Nobility, for so the soul is the more
noble part. David calls it his Glory, Psalm. 16.9. and his Darling, Psalm.
22.21. Some of the Jew-Doctors make it the same with welfare, in the words
following: but that is not likely.

And my welfare passes away as a cloud] i.e. Totally, as before; irresistibly
like the wind: Job abounds with similitudes, ^^rorum vim simi^^ a vent
illustrat, and satutem a se abcunt in similitudine nubis. Merl.
which do notably illustrate. He would say, I am utterly deprived of all means
of avoiding this misery.

Verse 16. And now my soul is powered out upon me] Now that I am under these
inward terrors, I am become strengthlesse, even weak as water, my soul does
melt away for grief, as Psalm. 42.4. and I am as an hollow tree, wherein there
is not any heart of Oak: I am utterly dispirited.

The dares of affliction have taken hold upon me] And so hard hold, that I
despair of ever getting loose whiles alive.

Verse 17. My bones are pierced in me in the night season] Sleep is the Nurse
of Natura and the sweet parenthesis of men's griefs and cares. But Job had so
many aches and ailements in his body, (over and above the terrors and troubles
of his mind) that rest he could take none at all in the night season, when all
creatures are wont to be at quiet. For why? the very marrow of his bones raged
through intolerable pain: as if it had been run through with a Tuck. Nay ni^^e,

And my sinews (or, My Pulses) take no rest.] Heb. Sleep not; My sinews or
arteries are rackt with the Cramp; and my pulses, by the force of a Fever,
beat excessively, Vatabl.
and pant without intermission: Qui tamen minui deberent, qui^ cal^^ retrabitur
in partem interiorem; which yet should move more slowly by night, because then
the heat is drawn into the internal parts.

Verse 18. By the great force of my Disease is my garment changed] soil.
sudore, cru^te, sanit, sanguine; By the matter that my Disease forces outward
in Boils and Botches, is my garment (which once was decoru and Magistratus
insigne. the Ensign of my Authority) utterly stained and spoiled, loathsome to
my self, and noysom to others. Merlin. Totum cruentem and sordidatum. Merc.
Every one (say some Chymicks) has his own Balsom within him: his own bane it
is sure he has. Physicians hold, that in every two years there is such store
of ill humors and excrements engendered in the body, that a vessel of one
hundred ounces will scarce contain them. Now if these, by Gods appointment (for
he is the great Centurion, Matthew. 8.9. who has all diseases at his beck and
check) break outward, what an ulcerous Leper and Lazar must that man needs be?
This was Jobs case, and Munsters, (who called his sores, Gemmas, and preciosa
Dei ornamenta, Gods Gems and Jewels, Job. Manl. loc. c^^. p. 127
where with he decketh those whom he loves) and King Philips of Spain who,
besides many other diseases, had ingentem puris ex ulceribus reaundantiam, qua
binas indies scutellas diuits paedore impleret; Abundance of filthy matter
issuing out of his sores, Carol Scriban. Instit. Princep. cap. 20
insomuch as that no change of clothes, or Art of Physicians could keep him
from being devoured by Lice and Vermin thereby engendered.

It binds me about as the collar of my coat] It is become so stiff and
starky, that it wrings me and hurts me, as an uneasy collar girds and gripes a
man's neck: As the edge of my coat in gards me, so Broughton reads it. Beza
renders this latter part of the verse thus He (God) comp^sseth me about as the
collar of my coat. Piscato^ the whole, thus: By the greatness of his (Gods)
strength, (which he puts forth in scourging me with diseases) my garment
changes it self, (puts on, as it were, another (...) of scab^ and scurf,)
As the mouth of my coat he (God) girdeth me; (...), he pincheth my body with
diseases. But the former ^^^ding is better.

Verse 19. He (...) cast me into the mire] My Disease has so Vatablus senseth
it. Others, God has as it were trampled me to dirt, thrown me into the kernel,
and so done me the greatest disgrade that can be.

And I am become like dust and ashes] Like a dust-heap behind the door,
cad^vei^^^^ (...) says Merca^: Being covered all even (says Beza) with the
(...) and (...) that full from my (...); I am become more unlike unto the
unprofitable dust and ashes, then unto a living man. Dust and ashes are not
more like, one another, then their names are in the Original: sic (...), cinis,
See Genesis 3.19. and 18.17.

Verse 20 I cry unto thee, and thou do not hear me] This was a sore trial,
that God should cast him into straits, and there leave him. His enemies indeed
he usually deals so by, Ezekiel. 22.20. and 29.5. but not by his servants, Heb.
13.5. Or if he do leave them, yet he will not forsake them. The mother leaves
her child sometimes, but when he sets up his note and cries lustily, she
hasteneth to help him. So does God: But now Job cried unto him, and was not
heard or answered, to his thinking at least, and that was a great cut to him,
as Psalm 22.2.

I stand up] scil. To make supplication to my Judge, as Haman stood up to make
request for his life, Esth. 7.7. as the Publican stood and prayed, Luke. 18.13.
and as Moses and Samuel are supposed to stand before God in prayer for their
people, Jerem. 15.1. Hence that Proverb amongst the Jews, Absque stationibus,
non staret mundus. Did not the Saints stand in prayer, the world could not
stand.

And thou regardest me not] This was but a Mistake in Job, for the eyes of the
Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers. Only God
answers our prayer, non secundum voluntatem, tamen ad utilitatem: Not always
or as soon as we would, but does that which is better for us, and takes it ill
to be misconstrued, as he was by Job, witness the next words, bloody words
indeed, Accusat ergo Job Dominum mendacii. Brent. Contumeliosus viderispotest.
Merl.
and not far from Blasphemy.

Verse 21 Thou art become cruel to me] Mutatus es mihi in tyrannum. thou art
turned Tyrant toward me, so Brentius renders it: and the like he had said
before, chap. 16.13. and 19.8, 9, 10. out of the vehemence of his pain, and he
sense of his flesh, which should have been silenced, and faith exalted; the
property whereof, is to pick one contrary out of another (as life out of death,
assurance of deliverance out of deepest distresses, Deuteronomy. 32.36.) and to
persuade the heart that God concealeth his love, out of increasement of love,
and in very faithfulness afflicts his darlings, that he may be true to their
souls, Psalm. 1.19.75.

With thy strong hand thou opposest thy self against me] Heb. Thou batest me,
Satanically hate me; Intestinum odium exerces adversum me; Tremell.
and accordingly thou do practice all thy might upon me. Thus Job in his
heat, and that he may not seem to rage without reason, he subjoyneth

Verse 22. Thou liftest me up to the wind] Thou whifflest and wherriest me
about as chaff, or thistle-down. Pro libidine tractas me, thou usest me at thy
pleasure. Brent.


Thou causest me to ride upon it] Upon the wings of the wind, lifting me up
aloft that I may fall with the greater poise, as the Eagle is said to do the
Tortoise; Vt lapsu graviore ruam. --

Thou dissolvest my substance] Or, Thou meltest my wisdom: I have neither
flesh nor reason remaining. The issue that he expects of all these his
forementioned miseries, follows,

Verse 23. For I know that thou will bring me to death] Such hard thoughts had
Job of God, and such heavy thoughts of himself. Nam experior, mors avocat me.
so Tremellius: For I feel it, death calls me away. Sic ludis mecum, ut facile
conjiciam mihi moriendum esse says Brentius: Thou so dalliest with me. that I
plainly perceive I must shortly dye, there is no avoiding of it. 2 Cor. 1.8.9, 10
Thus good Job was pressed out of measure; above strength, insomuch as be
despaired even of life, and had the sentence (or denunciation) of death in
himself, etc. But God was better to him then his fears, and delivered him from
so great a death: this is usual.

Qui nil sper are potest, desperet nihil. And to the house appointed for all
living] That is, the grave, Psalm 49.14. (...)
and 89.48. that Congregation house of all living, (as heaven is called, the
Congregation house of the first born, Heb. 12.23.) the public or common
meeting place, as Isai. 14.13. the house of constitution or assignation to all
living (as the Hebrew here has it) that is, to all men, who are by an
excellency called, every creature, Mark 16.15 as being the best living
creatures upon earth.

Verse 24 Howbeit he will out stretch not his hand to the grave] He will not
dig up the dead (as the Papists dealt by Bucer and others) to afflict them any
more. Quid facere poterunt? Occident? Nunquid, resuscitabunt ut iterum
occidant! What can they do? (said Luther concerning his enemies who threatened
him) Will they kill me? but what then? Will they raise me up to life again,
that they may kill me again? No: Charles the Fifth Emperor, when he might have
done that, and was moved to do it, would not. Mors requies aerumnarum. Dead men
are at rest, was Chaucers Motto. There, (in the grave) the wicked cease from
troubling, and there the weary be at rest, chap. 3.17. Thus Job speaks, going
no further then the afflictions of the body, as being for his own part
fearlesse of eternal punishment. But as for the wicked, when they dye out of
bodily misery, it is but as the man's flying from a Lion, and a more savage Bear
meets him: or going from it into the house (this house mentioned in verse
23.) and that more venomous Serpent, (the Devil, who has the power of death,
Heb. 2.14.) there biteth him, Amos 5.19.

Though they cry in his destruction] i.e. Whiles God is crushing or killing of
them. Or, Is there any cry in his destruction? It was never yet known that dead
men made moan; what ever the Popish Legenders tell us of one that cried out, I
am dead, I am judged, I am damned; which gave occasion to Bruno to found the
Carthusian Order.

Verse 25. Did I not weep for him that was in trouble?] Rursum, per pathos,
excandescit. Here Job wondreth, Mercer.
and is much moved again at his unpitied condition, since himself was so pitiful
to the afflicted. He could safely say with Cyprian, Cum singulis pectus meum
copulo, moeroris and funeris pendera luctuosa participo, cum plangentibus
plango, cum destentibus desteo. He had tears ready for the afflicted, and wept
with those that weep: not for a Complement, as the Brasilians, who Vt flerent,
oculos erudiere suos. Nor out of melch-heartednesse, Ovid.
as Gordian the Emperor, who would weep for the beating of a boy at School.
But out of hearty compassion and commiseration, as good Nehemiah, chap. 2.2.
and those Christian Hebrews, chap. 10.33, 34. Now for as much as the merciful
have the promises of mercy made unto them, Matthew. 5.7. James. 2.13. And all men
say, Ab alio expectes, alteri quod feceris, Job marvelleth at others hard
heartedness toward him, and expostulateth the unkindnesse.

Was not my soul grieved for the poor?] Into whose case good Job put himself,
and so became mendicorum maximus (as Salvian says of Christ, Ad Eccles.
Carbol. l. 4
because he shareth with his Saints in all their necessities) he drew out not
only his sheaf, but his soul to the hungry, ( Isai. 58.7, 10) and satisfied the
afflicted soul; this was right. Contristata est anima mea super egenum. Some
render it, Restagnavis lachrymis anima mea, My soul stood with tears, like a
standing pool. Others ustulatur, (...), My soul burns; which is agreeable to
that of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 11.29. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is
offended, and I burn not?

Verse 26 When I looked for good] According to that general rule, and the
common course of Gods proceedings, With what measure ye mete, it shall be
measured to you again, Matthew. 7.2. With the merciful thou will show thy self
merciful, Psalm. 18.16. Middah cenegedh middah, say the Hebrews; Men shall have
measure for measure, like for like. Hence Job expected to have all things at
will, but it fell out somewhat otherwise; and this puzzled him, he could not
unriddle these cross occurrences. He could almost find in his heart to think,
that he was therefore so little pitied by others, because he had been so
pitiful to others.

When I waited for light, then came darknesse] Things grew every day worse and
worse with me, mending like sour Ale in Summer, as we say. Thus it fates many
times with Gods best servants; these children of light walk in darkness,
nevertheless let them trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay upon their God,
in the fail of all outward comforts, Isai. ^0.10. Habak 3.17, 18. This is the
triumph of faith, which tells the soul, that things must go backward before
they can come forward, and when matters are at worst they will mend.

Verse 27 My bowels boiled, and rested not,] Being tossed and tumbled with
continual boiling and bubbling, Ollae more insonuerunt. Merc.
rumbling and making a rattle (as the word signifies) whether through passion
or compassion. With most compassionate sympathy (says one learned Paraphrast)
did my bowels yearn over the afflicted, so that I could have no quiet in my
self, for grieving and taking thought for them: I was seldom or never without
sorrow for some one or others affliction.

The days of affliction prevented me] Prevision should have hindered this
prevention: Evils fore seen come no whit the sooner, but far the easier. It is
a labor well lost if they befall us not; well spent if they do: whereas coming
on the sudden, they find weak minds secure, make them miserable, leave them
desperate. Expect them therefore and prepare for them: Darts foreseen are
dintless.

Verse 28 I went mourning without the Sun] Ater ambulo, sed non ob Solemn; I am
not Sunburned, but heart burnt; black and discolored without, because parched
and dried up within by the force of my disease and my grief, wherewith I am
pained, pined, and even perished.

I stood up and cried in the Congregation] Which was not very handsome, but I
could not hold. Rise I did, and roar I must amidst the preass of people,
whatever they should think of me. So Mordecai went out into the midst of the
City, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry, and came even before the Kings
gate, etc. Esth. 4.1, 2. In extreme heaviness men care not to keep decorums.

Verse 29. I am a brother to Dragons, etc.] i.e. I utter a very lamentable
voice, or rather noise, like Dragons, which sucking the Elephants blood till he
fall down dead upon them, and quell them with his huge bulk, make an horrible
howling; Plin. Solin.
so horrible and hideous say some, that they amaze, yea, kill those that hear
it.

And a companion to Owles] I give forth rude and confused cries, as if I howled
with Owls, or grunted with Ostriches. We use to say of such, that they roar
like Bears, and bellow like Bulls, filling the air with their Outcries. Young
Ostriches cast off by their Dams, Job 39.14. Lam. 4.3. make pitiful moan; so
do the young Ravens for like cause, Psalm. 147.9. Job cried out more like a
beast then a man, in his pain and misery. This the Stoics censured as
effeminate, and would not allow a wise or valiant man to sigh, or cry, or show
any token of grief whatever befell him. But this was to destroy nature, and to
transform men into stocks and stones void of sense. The Patriarks bewailed
their deceased friends. David, likely, was not ignorant of the Gentiles
proverb, Weeping becomes not a King; yet he wept abundantly, yea, Eurip. --
(...)
he out-wept Jonathan: As the better any one is the more inclined to weeping
and lamentation, which yet must be duly moderated.

Verse 30 My skin is black upon me] Through the violence of the Fever, and
adust matter, his skin was as black and mud-coloured as the waters of the River
Nilus. which has its name Sihor in the Hebrew, from this root, Jer. 2.18. The
Ethiopians skin is black, but that is natural to them, and they think it best
so, and therefore paint the devil white, etc.

And my bones are burnt with heat] In the Fever they call Epialis, the heat is
all inward, and dries up the radical moisture. Job complains of such a
distemper, and so does David, Psalm. 32.3, 4. and Solomon tells us, that a
heavy heart dries up the bones. Beza expounds it of the Jaw Bone, dried and
pined away for want of moisture.

Verse 31. My harp also is turned to mourning] All the days of the afflicted
are evil, Prove. 15.15. his Harps are hanged up, Intempestivae (...) in luctu
Music Ecclus 22.6. (...) Sophoc^ Val. Max. Chr^ page 262
his Lute no longer (...) but for melancholy airs; his Song nothing but
Lachrymae, doleful ditties: his Organs, and all those Instruments that were
wont to divert him, are condemned either to sigh or to be silent. Gillimer,
overcome and besieged by Bellisarius, sent to request of him three things; 1. a
loaf to ease his hunger, 2. a harp to ease his grief, 3. a sponge to dry up his
tears. Such mournful Music was Jobs, if any at all.

CAAP. XXXI. Verse 1. I made a covenant with mine eyes]
THis Chapter, as it is one of the largest in all the book, so it is elegant,
various, and very full of matter: for it shows us, as in a mirror, both what
we should do, and what we should not do. Good Melancthon, about the beginning
of the Reformation, mournfully complained, Quos fugiamus habemus; quos sequamur
non intelligimus: We have whom to fly from, (meaning the Papists,) but whom to
follow, we yet understand not, (by reason of the many divisions among
Protestants.) But here we may be at a better certainty; by treading in Jobs
footsteps, and striving to express him to the world: who against all the cavils
and calumnies of his foe-friends, makes it out here, that he is no hypocrite or
flagitious person (as they falsely charged him,) but a man fearing God, and
eschewing evil, chap. 1.1. Let therefore as many as would be perfect, be thus
minded; and thus mannered: propounding to themselves the highest pitch, and the
best patterns; resolving to resemble them as much as may be. Here we have Job
holy care to fly fornication as a deadly evil; by avoiding the occasion, by
taking bonds of his senses, and by doing all he could to be out of they way,
(...) -- oculi sunt in amore duces.
when the temptation came. Austin thanks God that the temptation and his heart
met not. Job would prevent that mischief, by laying laws upon his eyes, those
windows of wickedness, and loop-holes of lust, the very door and bait of all
evil concupiscence, Mat. 5.29. 1 Job. 2.16. that flesh-pleasing lust, that
nest-egge of the Devil, (as One wittily calls it) that eldest child of old
Adams strength, bearing name of the Mother, which is called in general, Lust,
or Concupiscence. Now that Job might not lust, he would not look on a forbidden
object: for he knew that wanton glances cause contemplative wickedness; such as
will soon break out into soul practices: as ill humors in the body, do into
sores and botches.

Why then should I think upon a Maid?] Contemplarer in virginem; Lustfully
consider her beauty, till my heart be hot as an oven with lawless lusts, and my
body be moyled with that abominable filth. For unbrideled lust, like the wild
fig, will soon mount over the wall: and those base, vain wanton, capering
thoughts will break out, if not timely suppressed: if we handle them not
roughly at the door (as Elisha said) their masters feet will not be far behind
them. Quell them therefore and crush them in the egg: it is not safe being at
Satan's mess, though our spoon be never so long: remember, that of looking comes
thinking; and of thinking, worse. Look upon the woeful chain of David's lust, and
remember how many have died of the wound in the eye. The Basilisk slays with
his sight. Circe will enchant all that behold her. Irregular glancing, or
inordinate gazing, is that which metamorphoseth a man into a beast, and makes
him a prey to his own brutish affections. Hence David prays, Turn away mine
eyes from beholding vanity, Psalm. 119.37. Job here steppeth one degree further,
from a prayer to a vow; yea, from a vow to an imprecation, verse 7. That his
eyes should be eyes of Adamant, that will turn only to one point; that he would
not look but where he might lawfully like. Saints have a single eye (and
contrariwise the wicked, Hos. 3.1.) like that Persian Lady, who being at the
marriage of Cyrus, and afterward asked how she liked the bridegroom? How? said
she: I know not: I saw no body but my husband. Charles 5 used to clap to his
casement: and the young Lord Harrington to pull his Hat over his eyes, when
fair Ladies passed along.

Verse 2. For what portion of God is there from above?] What? but a portion
with the Devil, and hypocrites? The unjust are reserved unto the day of
judgment to be punished, says Peter; but chiefly, they that walk after the
flesh, in the lust of uncleanness, 2 Pet. 2.9, 10. Such shall have a specialty
of punishment, even the hottest fire in hell: And hereby Job frighted his
Conscience from this foul sin; and well he might: did men but consider what sin
would cost them, they durst not but be innocent: but the hope of impunity
hardens them, and so hasteneth their destruction. Hac, tanquam lena, semper
usus est antiquus ille serpens, this hope, as a Bawd, Merlin.
that old manslayer, has ever made use of, to allure men into wickedness. But
set the threats of Gods Word (such as are 1 Cor. 6.9. Heb. 13.3. Ephesians. 5.3.)
against this sin, and the sin is laid. Satan can no more abide by it, than an
Owl by the shining of the Sun. A man will be loath to fetch Gold out of a fiery
crucible.

Or, What inheritance of the Almighty from on high?] God, and Almighty. and
from above. and from on high. By all these expressions, Job affects himself
with the due apprehension of the divine Majesty, that he may be wise, and
beware how he fall into the punishing hands of this living God. The Lord your
God, says Moses to the people, is God of gods, and Lord of lords; a great God,
a mighty and a terrible, Deuteronomy. 10.16, 19.
etc. Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your hearts; cut off and cast away
that filthy foreskin, shave your eyebrows, (as the Leper was to do,) pull out
your right eyes, etc. So Joshua; God, says he, is an holy God, he is a jealous
God, be will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins; sc. unless you
will part with them, though never so dear or delicious, chap. 24.19.

Verse 3. Is not destruction to the wicked?) yes; that is their portion, their
inheritance: and so Job makes answer to his own question proposed in the verse
aforegoing. The ruin of impure souls is infallible, unsupportable,
unavoidable: if God has aversion from all other sinners, he has hatred and
horror for the unchaste: such stinking goats shall be set on the left hand,
and sent to hell; where they shall have so much the more of punishment, as they
had here of sensual and sinful pleasure, as sour sauce to their sweet meats,
Rev. 18.7. Not to speak of the miseries they meet with here, which are not a
sew: in their souls, hardness of heart, or horror of conscience: in their
bodies, soul and loathsome diseases; such as will stick to them, when their best
friends forsake them: in their names, indeleble reproach and infamy; like an
iron-mole which nothing can fetch out; like the Leprosy which could never be
scraped out of the walls: in their estates, poverty, even to a piece of bread,
Prove. 6.26. Harlots are Poscinummia, Crumenimulge; suck-purses, Luke 15.14. In
their posterity: as Jericho was built, so is uncleanness plagued, bath in the
oldest and youngest: It goes through the race, till it have wasted all.

Corpus, ^pes, anim^n, faman, vim, lumina, Scortum,
Debilitat, perdit, necat, anfert, eripit, what.
And a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?] Even such as is unusual
and extraordinary; as upon the Sodomites, who going after strange flesh, were
thrown forth for an example, as Juda has it, Verse 7. So those Benjamites,
Judge. 20. the Trojans, the Lacedaemonians at Lenctra; Zimri and Cozbi: Zedekiah
and Ahab. Jer. 29.22. Elies two sons; Heraclius the Emperor, Muleasses King of
Tunes in Barbary, bereft by his own son Amida (another Absalom) not of his
Kingdom only, but of his eyes too, put out with a burning ho^iron: those eyes
of his that had been full of adultery, and could not cease to sin. In Hebrew,
the same word signifies both an eye and a fountain, to show, says One, that
from the eye, at a fountain, flows both sin and misery.

Verse 4. Does he not see my ways, and count, etc?] yea, sure he does so: and
the conscience of Gods Omniscience, who would soon take him tripping kept him
from this great wickedness. So it did Joseph, but so it did not David; who is
therefore said to despise God and his commandment (2 Samuel 12.9, 10.) to do
evil in his sight; and this was no small aggravation of his offense. Ne peccar
Dum ipsi vider, I have seen the lewdness of thy whoredom, Jer. 13.27. Even I
know, and am a witness, says the Lord, Jer. 29.23. That should be a powerful
retentive from (...) Prove. 5.21.

And count all my steps?] Does not he cipher them up? Hebeus (...) in (...)
rate: not my ways only, my counsels and cogitations, but my steps also, that
is all mine outward attempts and actions. A most needful, and useful
consideration (...) to keep men within the compass of obedience. See this
doctrine of Gods singular providence, plainly and plentifully set forth. Psalm.
139.1, 2, 3, 4.

Verse 5. If I have walked with vanity] As they do who disquiet themselves in
vain, in heaping up riches by evil arts, by deceits and covin in bargaining; by
getting other men's means fraudmently, etc. The getting of treasures by an evil
tongue, (or any the like indirect course) is a vanity tossed so and fro of them
that seek death, Prove. 21.6. Eventually such do seek death, though not
intentionally; they spin a fair thread to strangle themselves, both temporally
and eternally. Such vain and vile ways therefore Job carefully declined;
Furtum a Virg. vocatur. inane. Aencid. 6.
for he knew them to be both base and bootless. Ephraim fed upon the wind, the
balances of deceit were in his hand: if thereby he filled his purse with coin,
yet he had emptiness in his soul: Lucrum in arca, damnum in conscientia: filled
he was with air, and that air was pestilential too: his breath and death he
drew in together: Job would none of that.

Or if my foot has hasted to deceit] If I have been nimble and active to go
beyond and defraud another in any matter, 1 Thessalonians. 4.6. which, what is it else,
but crimen stellionatus, the very sin of cozenage? and this not only acted, but
arted after long trading in it, as the words of walking and hasting seem to
import?

Verse 6. Let me be weighed in an even balance] Heb. Let him weigh me, Examinet
me, says Tremellius. David with the like confidence, Search me, O God, says
he, Psa. 139.23, 24
and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any
wicked way in me, any course of sin (that is grievous to God or man) wherein I
have walked, or my foot has hasted. Job would not rest in his own hearts
applause; neither would he be borne down by his friends false charges: but puts
himself into Gods hands to be weighed, and then makes no question, but his
present sufferings will be found heavier than his former miscarriages, in his
inter-dealings with men for matter of gain: and that there is some other cause
(though what he knows not) for which God does so grievously afflict him. See
David doing the like, Psalm. 7.4. and 26.2.

That God may know mine integrity] i.e. That he may make known mine innocence
and upright-heartedness in this particular of commerce with others; that I have
not dealt deceitfully. Otherwise, if God should weigh the best that are in a
balance, they would be found too light. if he mark iniquities, no man living
can be justified, Psalm. 139.3. and 143.2. If he turn up the Bottom of the Bag,
all our secret thefts will out, and come to reckoning. It is an idle conceit of
some ignorant folk, That God will weigh their good deeds against their bad: and
they shall well enough set off with him by the one for the other. This they
have drawn (as they have not a few other fopperies) from that practice of
Popish Priests; to persuade people, that when men are at point of death, St.
Michael the Archangel brings a pair of balances, and puts in one scale
their good works, and in the other their sins; and that if those weigh down
these, they are ^aved: as if otherwise, they are damned. But what says an
Ancient; Vae hominum vitae etiamsi landabili, etc. Woe to the best man alive,
if God should weigh him in a balance of justice: since his sins would be found
heavier than the sands of the Sea, Job 9.15. and 10.15.

Verse 7. If my step has turned out of the way] sc. Of justice and equity, in
t^^ding and tr^ffacking to get the Mammon of unrighteousness. No: the Sun might
sooner be turned out of his course, (as it was once said of Fabricius) than Job
out of the track of truth and honesty. He had said laws upon his feet, his
eyes, and his hands too: binding them all to the good behavior: Witness the
next words.

And mine heart walked after mine eyes] As it does too often to the coveting
other men Goods; which St. John casts, the lust of the eyes, 1 Epist. 2.16.
Alexander the Great called the Persian Maids, Dolores oculorum, the griefs of
the eyes. The wedge of Gold and Babylonish Garment proved to be so to covetous
Achan. Josh. 7.21, and Nabot^? Vineyard to that Non-such Ahab, 1 King. 21.2. He
was even sick of it, and could not be cured but by a S^llet out of it. Hence
the law flatly forbids men to go after the sight of their eyes, and the lust
of their hearts: for these are seldom ^undred, Numb. 15.39. Eccles. 11.9.
Unruly eyes, like Jacobs sheep, too firmly fixed on unlawful objects, make the
affections bring forth spotted (...), Job would therefore set a guard upon
them, Oculus and cor sunt proxeneta peccati. Hebr. Proverb..
lest they should prove (...) of wickedness to the heart: as that hang by Hiram
the Ad^ttam^te was to Judah, Genesis 38.20. There is an easy passage for evil
through the eyes into the heart says (...). And if any blot has cleaved to my
hands] If I have been fingering that which was not sit for me to meddle with;
viz. evil-gotten goods, whether by bribery, usury, deceit, or the like; the
very touching whereof will blot and benumb the hands, as Pliny writes of the
fish Torpedo; and as scholars know, that Demosthenes (a great Lawyer) by
poizing Harpalus his goblet, was tempted and swayed to favor his Cause, to the
great danger of his Country, and his own indeleble infamy.

-- Verse 8. Then let me sow, and another eate] God loves to retaliate: and let
him do so to me, according to that he has threatened, Deuteronomy. 28, 30, etc. and as
he executed upon Laban, Nabal, Saul, Haman, others. The Greeks have a Proverb,
(...) Some sow that which others reap. This Job wishes may befall, if he had
been oppressive and injurious; as Eliphaz had wrongfully accused him, chap.
22.6.

Yea, let my offspring be rooted out] Or, Let that which I have planted. be
plucked up by the roots. It is commonly seen, that oppressors and
unconscionable persons procure their own ruth and ruin: and he that gathers
the fruits of another man's tree, pulls his own up by the roots.

(...) They who spoil houses which they builded not, Job 20.19. shall, when
they cease to spoil, be made a spoil: and when they have made an end of
dealing treacherously, be treacherously dealt with themselves, Isaiah, 33.1.

Verse 9. If my heart has been deceived by a woman] By a she-sinner, as they
call such, a strange woman, (as the Scripture) whose lips are snares, (...)
Hinc (...) persuadeo.
whose hands are bands, whose words are cords to draw a man in, as an Ox to the
slaughter, Prove, 7.21. whose face is as a glass, wherein whiles larks gaze,
they are taken in a day-net. Here Job disavoweth and disclaimeth the sin of
Adultery, (purging himself as it were by Oath) as before he had done of
fornication, and of wrong-dealing. These sins he reckons up, either as they
came to mind; or else in such order as men are many times tempted to them.
Young people are prone to fornication: Job, when young, had kept himself clear
from that iniquity. When men have got some years over their heads, and are
entered into the world (as they call it) they usually grow greedy and gripple:
they are set upon it, and will be rich, however they come by it. Job was none
such neither, verse 5.7. Afterward, when married, they are sick of a Plu^isie:
and as the Devil, who sets them a work, they long to be sowing another man's
ground, Matthew. 13.25. The temptation to fornication is strong, but to adultery
stronger: God does often punish fornication, unrepented of, Adulterium quasi ad
alterius torum.
with strong and vexing honings and hankerings after strange flesh. But Job
either was never troubled in this kind: or else when the temptation came, he
was sure to be ever out of the way. The Devils fire fell upon wet tinder: and
if he knocked at Jobs door, there was no body at home to look out at the window
and let him in: for he considered the punishment both humane, verse 11. and
divine, verse 12. due to this great wickedness.

Or if I have laid wait at my neighbors door] Either as waiting the
opportunity of his absence, as Prove. 7.19. or as insinuating my self into her
familiarity, whiles she was standing in her door. Of the Italian Women, one
gives this Character; That though witty in speech, and modest in outward
appearance, yet they are magpies at the door, Goats in the garden, Devils in
the house, Angels in the streets, and Sirens in the windows: Jobs heart was not
deceived by any such: neither sought he to defraud his brother in any such
matter, 1 Thessalonians. 4.5, 6. See the Note on Job. 8.4.

Verse 10. Then let my wise grind unto another] i.e. Let her be his slave, as
Lam. 5.13. Exodus 11.5. Matthew. 24.41. Or rather, let her be his Where: and may
my sin, Vatab. -- Alicnas Permolere uxores. Horat. Sic (...). i.e. molcre, apud
Theocrit (...). est coire.
which has served her for example, serve her also for excuse. Not that Job
would Hereby license his wise to commit filthiness (as those Lituanians, who
have their Connubii adjutores, coadjutors in wedlock, and prize them far above
all their acquaintance, as Maginus relates: and as some wittals amongst us,
pandars to their own beds, who either for gain, or for a quiet life, wink at
their wives disloyalty; and, as Wood culvers, or silly Hedg-sparrows, hatch and
bring up that which Cuckow's lay in their nests) but to set forth by this
horrible imprecation, how extremely he abhorred the sin of Adultery.

And let others bow down upon her] A clean expression of an unclean act. Some
Borborologi podicentex ore faciunt, being like Ducks that ever have their noses
pudling in puddles: sic hi spurcitias Veneris eliminant; delight in ribaldry,
and obscene language; as did Proculus the Emperor, and before him, that beast
Tiberius. These are to be avoided as Pests and botches of humance society. So
also are Stage Plays for that very cause, as the Brothels of bawdery, the
corrupters of youth, the canker of the Commonwealth, as Plato, an heathen,
complained; Filthiness and fornication should not be once named among
Christians, Ephesians. 5.3. Groves were flatly forbidden by God to be planted near
the places of his Worship; in detestation of that heathenish custom of Priapus
his worshippers, promiscuously satisfying their lusts in a thicket, after they
had sacrificed; thereby, as they conceived, best pleasing their god.

Verse II. For this is an heinous crime] Hoc enim grande flagitium est; so the
Tigurines translate: For this is a wickedness with a witness, though counted by
some a light offense, a peccadillo. The Popish Priests, deeply guilty of it
themselves, seldom cried out against it in their Sermons: this the great ones,
and others, observed; and therefore ran into it, as if it had been a venial
sin, if any sin at all. But we have not so learned Christ: and there was once
found an English Bishop, ( Adelm, Elect Bishop of Sherborn, anno 705.) who
boldly and sharply reproved Pope Sergius to his face for this foul sin. Godwin.
Catal. page 333.
Joseph calls it a great wickedness, Genesis 39.9. because a breach of the bond
of loyalty, which cannot but be treachery: as also because it destroys
society, and the purity of posterity, stealing sometimes an heir into the
estate, etc.

Yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the Judges] Since it is a thest of
that which is most precious and most peculiar to the owner; as Joseph told his
Mistress, Genesis 39. the suspicion or jealousy of it, raises the rage of a man
to such an h^^ght, that it will not be allayed without revenge, Prove. 6.34, 35.
Some render it, iniquitas judicata, an iniquity already adjudged capital. The
Hebrew has it, an iniquity of the Judges; that is, That which Judges should
severely punish. Before the Law Tamar was to have been burnt for it, Genesis
38.24. as under the Law the Highpriests daughter, Levit. 21.9. Ahab and
Zedekiah were roasted in the fire for this offense, Ezekiel. 23.25. alludeth to
this custom.
by Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, Jer. 29.22, 23. Some think that these two
were the Elders that assaulted Susanna, The Egyptians cut off the Harlots nose,
and the Adulterers members. The Locrians pulled out their eyes. The Julian Law
among the Romans, Lex Julia dormis?
adjudged them to dye; and Hierom says, this Law was yet in force in his time;
but the Poet complains, that for want of due execution, it lay dormant, as
many other good Laws do by the baseness and partiality of the Judges: Such as
were those Athenian Judges, who having before them Phryne that notable
Strumpet, Plutarch. vit. 10 Rhetor. in Hyper.
were about to pass sentence of death upon her; but when her Advocate
Hyperides had opened her bosom, and showed them her beautiful breasts to move
them to mercy, they acquitted her, and let her go. In like sort, also they
dealt with the Dame of Smyrna, whom they appointed to appear some hundred years
after. How much better the old Saxons, who whilst they were yet heathens, made
a Law (and saw it well executed) that the Adultetess should be first strangled,
and then burnt in a bonfire, Lavat, in loc.
over which the Adulterer was to be hanged in chains, and burnt to death by
degrees? And of another Heathen people we read, Buroughs on Hos. vol. 1. p. 276
that they put the Adulterers and Adulteresses heads into the paunch of a
beast, where all the fifth lies, and so stifled them to death.

Verse 12 For it is a fire that consumes to destruction] Ad Gehennam usque, to
the place of destruction. Heb. to Abaddon, that burns as low as hell it self.
In case ^^en should be slack to punish this heinous Grime, yet Whoremongers and
Adulterers God will judge, Heb. 13.3. shutting them out of heaven, Rev. 22.15.
(for what should any such dirty dog do trampling on that golden pavement?) and
thrusting them into hell, as he did the filthy Sodomites, Jude 7. beside that
hell above-ground which he rained from heaven, upon them, hot fire for their
burning lusts, and stinking brimstone for their stinking brutishness. How God
signally punished this sin in Charles 2 King of Navarre, roasting him to death,
See my Note on Genesis 19.24. Joane of Naples also, and Mary of Arragon, wife to
the Emperor Otho the third, burnt at a stake, are set upon Record as instances
of the divine displeasure against Adultery, a fire which burns hearts, and
consumes houses.

And would root out all mine increase] Leaving me nothing, as a devouring fire
burns up men, cattle, houses, corn, trees, etc. So does this fin all a man's
income, baring him to the very bones, and exhausting him to the utmost: So that
like Tiberius at Capreae, he does indies perire, which is a bitterness beyond
that of death, Eccles. 7.26. Or like Samson, befooled and bereft of all by
Dalilah, who had not her name for naught, for it comes from Dalal, to exhaust
and impoverish. And indeed such king of creatures do ordinarily drain the
strength, exhaust the purses, dry up the credit, waste and consume the all of
the mightiest Samsons. Besides, the loss of their immortal souls, and perpetual
shame at the last day, (when all their faults shall be written in their
foreheads) unless the matter be taken up in the Judges privy Chamber of mercy;
and unless, by timely repentance, course be taken to stop his open judicial
proceeding in Court.

Verse 13. If I did despise the cause of my man servant, etc.] Servants of old
(among the Heathen especially) were mere slaves to their Masters according to
the flesh, who had power to use them at their pleasure, as they did their
cattle. (...)
A servant (says Aristotle) is the Masters Instrument, and wholly his. He
might do what he would to them, says Seneca, even to the taking away of their
lives, without danger of Law. But Job held with the same Seneca, That Posse and
nolle nobile est; and that in some cases, Nimis angusta innocentia est, ad
legem bonumesse; That utmost right is utmost wrong; and that there will come an
after reckoning, the forethought whereof awed him, and swayed him to do his
servants right, when he might have oppressed them, and tyrannized over them; as
now the Turks do over their Gally-slaves. Of Archbishop Cranmer it is recorded,
that he never raged so far with any of his household-servants, as once to call
the meanest of them Varlet or Knave in anger. Tremellius, who was for a time
entertained in his house, says of it, That it was, Enarat in Hos. praefat.
Schola vel Palaestra pietatis and literarum. A school or Nursery of Piety and
Learning. And therefore what wonder that there was so good accord betwixt him
and his family, when there was so careful a performance of Domestical duties,
and he was not a better man then a Master? Think the same of Job, Discontents
might fall out in his house, and complaints might be made, which he heard with
patience, and then set all to rights again, taking course that he might be both
loved and feared by all about him.

Verse 14. What then shall I do when God rises up, etc.] Job considered, That
himself had a Master in heaven, Col. 4.1. That there is One higher thou the
highest, Eccles. 5 8. with whom there is no respect of persons, but wherein
soever any deal proudly, God is above them. Exodus 18.11. These and the like
humbling considerations, and not any placability or natural courteousnesse,
made him deal thus fairly and kindly with his servants; how much more then
with his wife and children, etc?

And when he visits, what shall I answer?] Job looked to be visited, and
called to an account of his household Government. It is a good saying of an
Heathen, Cic. 4. in Verr^
Ita vivamus, etc. Let us so live, as those that must render an account of all
we do. And that which the Ruffian in Seneca scoffeth at in the sober young man,
is true of the godly in a sense more divine, Ita laborat, ita ludit, it a
coenat, ita potat, ita loquitur, ita vivit, ut qui Ephemerides patrs est
approbaturus: that is, He so labors, so sporteth, so eats, so drinks, so
speaks, so lives, as he that must approve his day-books to his father. Job
was not to learn, that there is a way of upright walking in our houses, so as
God will come to us, if our houses be rightly ordered, Psalm. 101.2. and we
shall look him in the face with comfort; for it is called there a Perfect way,
in opposition to hypocrisy. Now uprightness has boldness.

Ver. 15. Did not he that made me in the womb, make him?] In which regard, have
not we all one Father, and has not one God created us? Mal. 2.10. Is it not he
who forms and shapeth us, and all by the Book, Psalm. 139.16. We are all of
all sorts, in this respect, (whether Kings or Caitiffs, Lords or Losels) made
of the same mould, hewn out of the same Rock, dug out of the same pit, cut
out of the same piece, the shears only going between, as they say. Thus for our
bodies, and for our better part; is not the meanest made in Gods image, and as
capable of heaven, if god please, as the greatest? In the Law, the servant paid
the half shekle, as well as the Master. And in Christ Jesus, as there is
neither Jew nor Greek. so neither bond nor free, Gal. 3 28. Truth it is, God
has made these distinctions and degrees amongst men, but himself is no
respecter of persons. He acknowledges no faces (so the Hebrew expresses it.)
he takes no notice of any man's outward condition, as Country, Sex, Wisdom,
Wealth, Dignity, etc. These neither please God, nor displease him, but as they
are in a good or bad man: as a Cipher by it self is nothing without a figure
before it. This reason wrought with Job. and should do doubtless, with all
Superiors, to bring them to a moderation. Why should a poor man be slighted or
brow-beaten? Is he not Gods handy work also? Was he not made in secret, and
curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth, Psalm. 139.15. that is, in
his mothers womb, as it follows,

And did not one (that is God) fashion (Heb. apt or fit) us in the womb?]- Quum
fortuna, Apt and concinnc el. boravit. I rent. Servus (...) domini suiest.
non natura cos fecerit servos, cur, propter fortunam, eos contemptiores
habuissem? For as much as not nature, but providence has made them my
servants, why should I for that cause deal hardly with them: and not rather
favor them the more, for our common condition of birth and death, and coming
to Judgment?

Verse 16. If I have withheld the poor from their desire] The poor man
speaks supplications, he comes to the rich with his God help me, as Lazarus
did, Luke 16. (his very name speaks as much) but the rich answers him
roughly, Prove. 18.23. Either the answer cutteth of half the petition, as the
echo does the voice: or else he is commanded (...) quercumdicere, to tell his
tale to the Statues and Images, as Diogenes used to do; for of living men he
could get no hearing. But Jobs, suitors sped better. Pennylesse they were, but
not friendlesse: Drawn dry (as the Hebrew word imports) and such as whose
wealth was utterly wasted; but Job snored them up and supplied them. And this
he did readily, and at the first asking; they no sooner desired relief, but
they had it. Job was a cheerful giver, he neither denied nor delayed those that
came to him for relief or refuge. Merlin.
Multi contra studiose cansas inquirunt quibus se a benefaciendo cohibeant.
Many seek occasion to put off poor people, and to rid their hands of them.

Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail] Viduae saepe sunt verecunde.
Mercer.
Widows many times are modest; their eyes are weakened with much weeping, whiles
they remember their bypast comforts, and present crosses. This good Job
considered, and therefore soon condescended to their requests. He held it
enough that their hearts aked, and would not suffer their eyes to ache with
expecting his help, but speedily sped them.

(...) Verse 17 Or have eaten my morsel my self alone] As that churl Nabal
did, and therefore merited the title of Pamphagus. Many rich wretches are like
little children, who though they have their mouths full of meat, and both
their hands full, yet will part with none to another, but rather mar it. The
richer they are, the harder, as Dives; whom to upbraid, Laxarus was laid in the
bosom of liberal Abraham, of whom it is recorded, that he fat in the door of
his Tent in the heat of the day (the usual time of repose and repast) purposely
to invite passengers, Genesis 18.1. He pursued hospitality, as the Apostles
expression is, Rom 12.13. and a very hearty householder he was. Think the same
of Job, whose cup overflowed into other men's lesser ves. sles, as Ps. 23.5.
neither did any thing he eat do him good without some good company to take part
with him. Charity is no churl. Of a certain Bishop of Lincoln it is storied,
That he never thought he had that thing which he did not give. Quod nondu^
dederit, nondu^ se credit haber^ Senec. Martial.
hoc habeo quodcunque dedi, says One: And another, Quas dederis solas, semper
habebis, opes.

And the fatherless has not eaten thereof] These were his Fellow-Commoners,
Act. and Mo^ 1369
and the like is reported of Charles the Great, and of Bishop Hooper, who had
his Board of Beggars, widows and Ophans sent for to his Palace in Worcester,
and served every day with whole and wholesome meats, ere himself sat down to
dinner. Neither were these any losers, by their liberality. The flowers hurt
not their own fruit, though they yield honey to the painful Be. The Sun loses
not light, though it lend it to the Moon. But as the Moon, the fuller she is of
light, the further she gets from the Sun. And as the Sun moves slowest when he
is highest in the Zodiac; so are those farthest off from bounty, for the most
part, who abound most in plenty. Your fattest men have the least blood, and
your richest men do the least good. Whereas those that are rich in this world,
should be rich in good works, ready to distribute, 1 Timothy 6.17.
willing to communicate to widows and fatherless especially, since those are
Gods own Clyents

Verse 18. For from my youth he was brought up with me, etc.] i. e. Ever since
I could do any thing, it has been my delight to be doing good to the poor
Orphans, whom I have tenderly bred, as a father uses to breed his children.
Non est vnlgare Dei donum, says Mercer; This is no ordinary mercy, for men to
be of a merciful disposition, and melting hearted toward the poor and
necessitous, as some are naturally, and from the womb: Such are said to have
been Artaxerxes Longimanus, Titus the Emperor, Otho the third, Steven King of
Hungary, Oswald King of England, etc.

and I have guided her from my mothers womb] Ductavi illam, meaning the widow,
or the Orphan, to whom I have been a manly guide, and that of a child little.
See the Note aforegoing. Suttons Hospitals and many more monuments of Charity
in this kind are worthily alleged by some of our divines, to prove that for
their time and ability, Protestants have equalled and exceeded Papists in this
way of good works. Jobs desire of doing good appeared betimes, as if it had
been born with him: like as Plutach writes of Coriolanus, that he was so
natural and expert a Soldier, (...)
that he might seem to have been born with his arms upon his back, and his
weapons in his hands.

Verse. 19 If I have seen any perish for want of cloathing]. Job was ad omnem
humanitatem effectus atque assuefactus. This liberal man devised liberal
things; and as he dealt his bread to the hungry, so when he saw the naked he
covered him: he hid not himself from his own flesh, Isai. 58.7. Giles of
Brussels, and Mr. W^seheart the Scot, are famous among the Martyrs for their
charity in this kind. And so is Mr. Fax the Martyrologer, of whom it is
reported, that as he gave away his horse at one time to a poor man, when he had
no money to give him: So at another, having bestowed his wives money in a
petticoat, and meeting by the way home with a poor woman that wanted clothing,
he freely gave it her; telling his wife, that he had sent it to heaven before
her. The poor man's belly is surely the best Cubberd, and his back the best,
Wardrobe; Vhi non pereunt sed parturiunt, where they rot not, as those
moth-eaten ones in Saint James, chap. 5.2. but remain for ever. Great Alex
ander believed this far better then most amongst us, for when he had given away
all almost, and his friends asked him, where it was? he pointed to the poor and
said, In scrin^is, in my chests. and when he was further asked, what he kept
for himself? he answered, Spem majorum and meliorum, the hope of greater and
better things. And another of his name, viz. Pope Alexander the fifth; was so
liberal to the poor, that he left nothing to himself; so that he would merrily
say, that he was a rich Bishop, a poor Cardinal, and a beggarly Pope. (...) it
was wont to be said, Pauperibus sus dat gratis, nec munera curat
Curia Papalis; quod modo percipimus. Heidfold.



But this distich must be read backwards, says mine Author, thus, Percipimus
modo quod Papalis, etc. This Pope Alexander then was a rare bird at Rome.

Or any poor without covering] Whether he craved it of me or not; if I did but
see it, the poor creature was sure of it. The liberal man preventeth the poor
and needy, In Psalm. 103.
Psalm. 41.1. Praeoccupat vocem petituri, so Augustine expounds that Text. He
stays not till he is asked a good turn, but ministers to the uses, not only
to the necessities of the Saints, (...).
as the Apostles word is in the Original, Romans 12.13. So did Dr. Tailor Martyr,
when he visited the Almshouse in his Parish once a fortnight to see what they
lacked, and to supply them. And so did Mr. Fox, when unasked, he gave the poor
woman the petticoat, as abovesaid.

Verse 20. If his loins have not blessed me] As being warm-cloathed by me; not
with a suit of words, as those great benefactors, Jam. 2.15, 16. who were much
in mouth mercy, which indeed is good cheap. But a little handful of Jobs wool,
is much better then a mouthful of such aerie courtesies, and would open more
mouths to bless men: who now adays (for most part) will be but a friends at
a sneeze, the most you can get of them is, God bless you. These have as many
flouts and curses as Job had well wishes, and God thereby had praises;
according to that of our Savior, Matthew. 5.16.

And if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep] His sheep were his
own, else his charity had been unwarrantable. Honor the Lord with thy
substance, Prove. 3.9. but see it be thine, and not another. He that has a
bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he gives of his bread to the poor, Prove.
22.9. specially if he have spared it out of his own belly to give to the
hungry; if it were the bread of his own a^mense, or allowance, as some
interpret it.

Verse 21. If I have lift up my hand against the fatherless.] That is, against
any that are destitute of humane helps and defenses. Such to ill treat and
oppress, is easy for great ones. See Genesis 50, 15, 16. etc. But where the true
fear of God is, no such thing will be done. The Tigurines render, Si minitatus
sum Orphano, etc. If I have lifted up my hand in threatening first, and then let
it fall in striking and punishing the fatherless or friendless.

When I saw my help in the gate.] i.e. When by my greatness and grace with the
people, I might have born out my worst miscarriages; when I might have had more
then enough that would have defended, yea applauded me, as the Senate of Rome did
Ner^, even for his most malapert misdemeanors, and most horrid out^ages.

Verse 22. Then let mine arm fall from the shoulder-blade] That unworthy arm of
mine (as Cranmer cried out of that unworthy right hand of his, which he
therefore burnt first,) so injuriously lifted up against the fatherless, verse.
21. let it never be useful to me any more, but let me be punished with that
wherewith I have sinned. God sometimes takes notice of the offending member: as
in Jeroboams withered hand, Abimelechs head, which had stolen the Crown,
Samsons eyes, the rich man's tongue, the Adulteresses thigh, Numb. 5.27. This
Job knew, and therefore subjoyneth this imprecation, Diris se devovens, thereby
to clear himself from Eliphaz his false imputations, chap. 22.6, 7. The like
may be done by us, but sparingly, and not without great necessity, for the
helping of the truth in necessity, lest if we do it falsely or rashly, God say,
Acts and Mon.
Amen, and set set his Fiat to it; as he has done in sundry instances in
several ages: Witness Alexander the cruel keeper of Newgate, and his son in
Law John Peter, who rotted above ground according to their wish. So Anne
Averies, in Queen Elizabeth's days: Sir Gervaise Ell^wayes in King James his,
hanged on the Tower-hil, which he consest was just upon him, for that in
Carding and Dicing he had often wished himself hanged, if it were not so and so.

And mine arm be broken from the bone] Broken to shivers, as the word
signifies, and by the infamous hands of the hang man, for a terror to all
false Judges, as some do sense it: Rumpar medins, says Brentius, as Judas
burst in the midst with a huge crack, Act. and Mon. 962.
Acts 1.18. his guts gushing out; as did likewise Foxfords a great Persecutor
in Henry the Eighth; time. Some men's sins go before to judgment, God hanging
them up, as it were, in Gibbets, that others may hear and fear, and do no more
so.

Verse 23. For destruction from God was a terror to me] Such an eminent and
exemplary calamity or misery, as is mentioned in the former verse, affrighted
me from wrong-dealing. I foresaw the evil event of such practices, and
therefore durst not venture. We may not fear the punishment only, and not the
offense (for that is a servile fear, and has torment:) Neither may we fear the
punishment more then the offense. But to fear the punishment with the offense,
the offense being feared in the first place, and most, this is incident to
Saints, and commanded Matt^ 10.28.

And by reason of his highness (or excellency) I could not endure] Non
pravaluissem, says Tremellius. The Hebrew is, I could not; scil. Prevail or
subsist. If there be no standing before a Lion, or bearing up sail before a
tempest, why should any one think to contest with Omnipotency, to strive with
his Maker, whom nothing can disarm or paci^e, but an humble yeildance to his
Justice in hope of mercy, with a resolution to fear before him continually, as
the Scripture phraseth it?

Verse 24. If I have made gold my hope] If have trusted in uncertain riches,
and been high minded, as Paul expounds it, 1 Timothy 6 17. The LXX read Si posui
(...) in conjugium meum; signifying the covetous man's gre^e love. Minus. Octav.
Holding my self simply the better or the safer for the wealth I have gotten.
This is creature confidence, this is flat Idolatry, worse then that of the
belly-god, who sacrifices to his gut, but trusts not to it. An Ancient
complains (and not without cause) Divites facultatious suis alligatos magis
aurum consuevisse su^picere quam coelum, That rich men mind Gol: more then God;
and money more then mercy. If wealth be wanting, they sit down in a faithless,
sullen discontent and despair; as if they have it, they rise up in a corky,
frothy confidence that all shall go well with them. This Saint Paul talls
Idolatry, Col. 3.5. Saint James, Adultery, chap. 4.4. and enmity with God, in a
sense both Active and Passive; for it makes a man both to hate God, and to be
hated by God. Now who would buy Gold at so dear a rate?

Or have said to the fine gold Thou art (...) confidence] This the Mammonist
speaks, as if he were bowing before his golden god, whereunto, though he how
not the knee, yet with his heart he serves it. (and Obea^en^^ (...) better
then Sacrifice) and with his tongue he talks to it, saying. Thou art my
confidence; if thou fail me, I must needs sink, and with all his might he makes
after it, as if his life lay upon it, which yet our Savior says, does ^ot
con^is^ in the abundance of thos^ things a man has, Luke 12.15. since (as a
ship) he may have enough to sink him, but not enough to satisfy him.

Verse 25. If I rejoiced because my wealth was great] Those that trust in it
cannot but rejoice in the increase of it; though in truth, they do rather revel
than rejoice: for true ^oy is a severe thing, says the Philosopher, and must
have a better bottom, than these bona scabelli, than corn, and wine, and
outward substance, Psalm. 4.7. Job rejoiced not, though the world came tumbling
in upon him, as we say. For he knew, he was but a weathe-sheep, upon whom the
shepherd had bestowed a Bell more than upon the rest of the flock: and
therefore he would not cast his nose into the wind, and carry his crest the
higher, for outward prosperity. If God should take what he had so graciously
given, he would bear it not only patiently, but thankfully, and fruitfully, as
he did ch^p. 1.21. suffering with joy the spoiling of his Goods, as having in
Heaven a more enduring substance, Hebrews 10. ver. 34.

And because mine hand had gotten much] Heb. Had found very much. Per mim^simi
verba avaroru^ imitatur. Lavat.
This he speaks in the worldlings language, who ascribe all they have to
their own industry and good fortune: God is not in all their thoughts. But Job
is of another spirit; and as for this sinful self-ascribing, he utterly
detesteth and disavoweth it.

Verse 26. If I beheld the Sun when it shined] Viz. To adore it as the Persians
did, and other heathens. The Egyptians had their Heliepolis, or City of the
Sun: and the Canaanites their Timua^h H^res, Judge. 2.9. Josh. 24.30. that is,
the fi^ure of the Sun: so called, from the Idolatry there committed, in
worshipping the Sun (though I know there is another reason given:) The Persians
consecrated a Horse to the Sun; as the swiftest to the swiftest: and the
idolatrous Israelites had their horses of the Sun, which Josiah took away. It
is not amiss to behold the Sun, Moon, and Stars in their pomp and luster. It is
sweet, says Solomon. Eccles. 11.7. Comfortable, says David, Psalm. 97.11. and
useful in many respects, to mind us of our present beauty and safety, Rev.
12.1. Psalm. 84.11. and of our future felicity and glory, Matthew 13.46. Dan.
12.3. but above all, of Christ that Sun of righteousness, Star of Jacob, etc.
But this we must do: not to worship them, as they of old did the Queen of
Heaven, (and this is thought to be the ancientest idolatry in the world) nor to
swear by them, as Matthew. 5.34. but to see and worship the Maker of them: which
because the blind Ethnicks did not, they were damned, Romans 1.19. Oh the, what
will become of us, who see much more of God, by so clear a light, in that
moltenooking-glass, Job 37.18?

Or the Moon walking in brightness] Heb. Bright or precious; that is,
illightened with the precious light of the Sun, as when she is at Full, and
shines like the finest Gold: and was therefore idolized by the Heathens, under
the names of Phebe, Diana, etc. Of this Idolatry Job here purges himself; as
he had done before of that other of Covetousness.

Verse 27. And my heart has been secretly ^ticed] sc. By the Devil, who is
(...), as says Synesius, a great promoter of Idolatry: and probably had
tempted good Job to this sin also; but was bravely repulsed. If I have done
this secretly, says he, that is, contrary to my open profession of sincere
Religion: See Deuteronomy. 27.10.

Or, my mouth has kissed my hand] An action of Idolaters, who kissed their
Idols that were present, 1 King. 19.18. Hos. 13.2. (as the Papists now do their
Mawmets, even to the wearing of hardest marble) and to those which were further
from them, they held out their hand, and afterward did put it to their mouth;
as an acknowledgement that they had their life and breath from them, says
D^^date, as a sign of subjection, says Piscator, from Genesis 41.40. Psalm. 2.12.
Kiss the Sun sc. Plut. in Caton. Uticens.
with a kiss of homage, such as wherewith Samuel kissed Saul, 1 Samuel 10.1. And
Plutarch says, that not to all, but to some special Commanders in chief, and
Captains General it was granted among the Romans, That the hand should be
kissed before them by way of honor: and this was called, In Cantic. ^erm. 4.
adorare, quasi applicare manum ados, That saying of Bernard is worthy the
inserting, Qui in se, non in Domino gloriatur, manum suam ofculatur; He that
glories in himself, and not in the Lord, kisseth his own hand, and is,
interpretative, an Idolater.

Verse 28. This also were an iniquity to be punished by the Judge] No less than
Adultery, but rather more. This also is iniquitas judiciaria, a God-provoking,
Land-desolating sin, a wickedness with a witness, a capital crime: see verse
11. and take notice how these soul sins swell in Jobs eyes as so many toads:
and how full in the mouth he is in speaking of them.

For I should have denied the God that is above] Far above any of these deastri
gentium, even the most high God, Genesis 14.18.22. I should rob the Master, to
give to the servant: ascribe that to the creature, which is due only to the
Creator: this he will by no means endure. For, be the gods of the Heathens
good-fellows, says One; the true God is a jealous God, and will not share his
Glory with another.

Verse 29. If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me] If I rejoiced
at his ruin, or fed my thoughts with his fall. Flesh and blood would have
taught him so to do; there being nothing more natural to us than revenge: as we
see in little ones. Heathens commended it for manhood, and held it out as
sweeter than life it self. At vindict a bonum vita jucundius ipsa. Arist. Rhet.
c. 1. lib. 9.
Howbeit some Heathens professed against it, as Seneca; Immans verbum est
ultio, says he; Revenge is unmanly, both word and thing. And, Qui ulciscitur
excusatius pecat; he that avengeth himself, sins, though he has some color
for his sin. Socrates is famous for forgiving of injuries: and Julius Caesar,
when he had Pompey's head presented to him, Non mihi places vindicta, sed
victoria.
wept, and said, I sought not revenge, but victory. Both Law and Gospel forbids
revenge: and Job, who lived before both, obeyed both; as here appears.
Enemies he had, but he hated them not. That of Solomon was his practice,
Rejoice not when thine enemy falls, and let not thine heart be glad when be
stumbleth, etc. Prove. 24.17, 18. See the Note there.

Or lift up my self, when evil found him] Sin will find men out sooner, or
later; Nomesis semper a tergo; and they called her (...), because unavoidable.
Men, may shuffle from side to side, as Balaams Ass did; but there is no escaping
this punishing Angel. God will pursue wicked men to destroy them, till such
time as they throw the Traitors head over the wall. Now, good Job had put over
his enemies to God, that he might order them, (which also he did) and therein
did himself no disservice. But how did Job deport himself toward them in this
case? Did he lift up himself and insult? Did he bestir himself, (as Broughton
here elegantly translateth) and was he well apaid? Nothing less.

Verse 30. Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin] Heb. My palate; which is one
of the nine instruments of speech. I have not so much as broken out into any
passionate word against him: but when I was raging ripe, I refrained, and
forbore boisterous and blustering expressions, whereby some would have vented
their choler in such a case. Nothing is more easy and ordinary than to curse
an enemy; by prayer at least to turn him over to God to be punished; as David
did Nabal, and it was soon done. But Job, out of private revenge, durst not do
this, whatever David did out of a zeal of Gods glory, which wicked men sought
to deface.

By wishing a Curse to his Soul] Heb. By asking his life by a Curse. Job knew
that cursing men, are cursed men, Psalm. 109.18. If the Prophets cursed their
enemies at any time, as Elisha did the Children at Bethel, and David often in the
Psalms, it was not livore vindictae, sed zelo justitiae; not out of a
vindictive spirit, G^rram
but by the instinct of Gods holy spirit, and out of zeal for Gods glory. Our
rule is, Bless them that persecute you; bless and curse not, Romans 12.14. Render
not evil for evil, or railing for railing; but contrariwise bless, knowing that
we are thereunto called, that we should inherit a blessing, 1 Pet. 3.9.
Epiphanius and Chrysostom falling out about Origens writings, wished a curse to
one another; and it fell out accordingly; the one died ere he came home, and
the other was unbishoped.

Verse 31. If the men of my tabernacle said not] Contubernales, sive domestici;
those of my family and familiarity. A man is to take heed of the iniquity of
his heels, that is, of his followers and attendants at the heels, as some sense
that text, Psalm. 49. 5. for these will be apt enough to put a man upon courses
of revenge, as they dealt by David, 1 Samuel 24.4. and 26.8. 2 Samuel 16.9. and by
the son of David, Luke 9.54. And thus Isidor, Cajetan, and others, interpret
these words, as if they were added to the former verse. 29, 30. further to
commend Jobs love to those that hated him. For although he were put on by his
domestics, who seeing their Master despitefully used, would have torn those
his enemies in pieces: yet he was not moved thereby, but contained and kept
them in from such violence. Beza thus paraphraseth this text; And yet I protest
that I wanted not setters on even amongst mine own household servants, who still
persuaded me to requite those injuries which I received with most bitter
revenge: nay, their minds were so incensed, that they cried out, That they
should never be satisfied on them, no not though they had eaten them up quick.

Oh that we had of his flesh!] So barbarous and brutish is revenge. See Psalm.
27.2.
Erasmus tells of a Friar Augustine of Antwerp; that he openly in the Pulpit
wished that Luther were there, that he might bite out his throat with his
teeth. Epist. lib. 16. ad obtrectat.
I can hardly forbear with these nails of mine to be thy death, said Friar
Brusierd to Bilney the Martyr. At the town of Bar in France, the Italians, in
hatred of Lutheranis^e, Acts and Mon. fol 914. Ibid. 1951.
brake forth into such fury, that they ripped up a living child, took out his
Liver, being as yet red hot, and eat it as meat. Christiern King of Denmark
pulled the dead body of his Enemy Steven, the Swedish General, out of the
grave, Val. Max christian. 138.
inusitataqus rabie dentibus adpetiit, and like a mad dog, tore it with his
teeth. The Jews, in Trajans time, having one Andrew for their Captain, cut in
pieces about Cyrent, many Greeks and Romans, eating their flesh, besmearing
themselves with their blood, and clothing themselves with their skins. The like
they did also about Cyprus, and in Egypt, Xiphil in Did.
to the slaughtering of above four hundred thousand people. Tacitus notes of
the Jews in general, that they are very kind among themselves, but contra
o^uts alies hostile adium, against all others they bear hostile hatred. Home
homini (...).

We cannot be satisfied] But with his heart blood. It is as easy to quench the
fire of Aetna, Planee inexplebile est vindictae desiderium. Mercer.
as the thoughts fired by revenge. See Psalm. 124.3. and 14.4.

Verse 32. The stranger did not lodge in the street] Job was so far from liking
and commending those enraged stomachs of his servants; that he would not suffer
strangers to lodge abroad in the night season. Gregory notes here, that he
speaks first of his pacifick disposition toward his enemies, and then of his
hospitality: because, says he, the heart must first be freed from malice and
wrath, and then charity is to be exercised, that we might be accepted. Abraham
neither set up an Altar to God, nor showed himself forward to entertain
strangers, till Lot and he were reconciled. Hospitality is commended to our
practice, both by the Prophet Isaiah, chap. 58.7. by St. Paul, Romans 12.13. Heb.
13.2. and by St. Peter, 1 Epist. 4.9. Of Cranmer, Tremellius testifies, that
he was home (...) nec minu (...), humane and hospitable, Epist. 57. (...)
after the example of Abraham and Lot, whom Synesius therefore calls, (...),
God-entertainers: Julian the Apostate reckons the hospitality of the
Primitive Christians, Chrysostom. in Joan. (...) Hinc tot olim Xenodochia.
among those three things that caused their Religion to be so generally
embraced. Of the Waldenses also, those ancient Protestants in Germany, it is
reported that they could travel from Colen to Millain in Italy; and every night
lodge with Hosts of their own profession, who would bid them heartily welcome.

But I opened my doors to the Traveller] I bid the weary wayfaring man welcome
to my house, Jupiter (...) dicebatur. Ad viam, vel versus viam.
and kept a good table for such. Mensares sacra est, per quam Deus honoratur
praeses amicitiae and hospitii. Job was known to be a good housekeeper, and
was much resorted to: he set open his gate in the highway; so Beza (after
Mercer) renders this text. It was his will, That that part of his house which
bounded upon the high-way-side, should always lie open to harbor Passengers.

Verse 33. If I covered my transgression as Adam] A transgressour then Job
yields himself: the lives of the best alive are fuller of sins, than the
firmament is of stars, or the furnace of sparks. But he did not Adam-like, or
after the manner of men, cover or conceal them, extenuate or excuse them,
denying them (as Cain did, Genesis 4.9. and Gehezi. 2 King. 5.25. and Ananias,
Act. 5.8.) or at least, dealing with them as the unjust Steward did, who for an
hundred set down fifty. Adam went about to hide his sin, alleging, non causam
pro causa; that for the cause of his flight that was not the true cause
thereof, viz. the voice of God, his fear thereupon, his nakedness, etc. thus
sin and shifting came into the world together. Secondly, when that would not
do, but that he was driven from that (...), then he seeks to excuse it, by
accusing God, and transferring the blame upon him, for giving him a woman to
tempt him, Genesis 3.12. The like hereunto do they that plead Predestination, or
Constellations, or natural inclination, etc. that put God to his proofs as they
did, Jer. 2.35. Job was none such: but made it his daily practice to
acknowledge his iniquities against himself, Psalm. 32.5. and with utmost
aggravation from all the circumstances: laying open how many transgressions
were wrapped up in each sin, as it is Levit. 16.21. lest as Samuel once said to
Jesse, Are here all thy sons? so God should say to Job, Are these all thy sins?
and, there being but one only covered, that one should prove destructive to his
soul, as that bastard Abimelech did to all his brethren. But now that he freely
and fully confesses his offenses, he is sure to find mercy, Prove. 28.18. No
man was ever kept out of heaven for his confessed badness: many are, for their
supposed goodness.

By hiding ^in^ iniquity in my bosom] As silly men think to do, 1 From God, who
is all-eye, and every man before God is all-window, so that he needs not a
window in his bosom (as the Heathen Momus wished) for God to look in at, Job.
34.22. 2 From the world; which yet they cannot always do: for God that
descryeth will also discover all, sooner or later; else how should that be
fulfilled, The name of the wicked (...). Broughton renders it, By hiding mine
iniquity of self-love: So Kimchi also reads it. Tremellius to the same sense,
Ex dilectione mei. And surely it is this sinful self-love that closes up men's
lips, and keeps them from pouring out their souls, as water before the Lord.
Some deal with their souls as others do with their bodies: when their beauty is
decayed, they desire to hide it from themselves, by false glasses, and from
others by painting; so their sins from themselves by false glosses, and from
others, by excuses. But this was not Jobs practice; for though he were a great
man, and able enough to have crushed those that should accuse him of any
miscarriage, yet he was far from it: as he sets forth in the next verse.

Verse 34. Did I fear a great multitude?] Or, Though I should have terrified a
great multitude, yet the most contemptible of the Families frayed me (or
humbled me) so that I held my peace, and went not out of door; q d. I could by
my greatness have born out my misdemeanors, and who durst have once questioned
me, or quackt before me? But this I did not, I durst not; as being rein'd in by
the reverential fear of God; yea, rather, if any one, though but of the meanest
rank, had come to me, and admonished me friendly of my faults, or else more
sharply reproved me, I took it well a worth from him, not once opening my mouth
to contend with him for my sins, nor at all stirring out of doors to do him
hurt. Let Us fight with our faults, and not with our friends that tell us of
them, said that German Emperor. And when a poor Hermit came to our Richard the
First. Anno 1195. and preaching to him the words of eternal life, bade him be
mindful of the subversion of Sodom, Hoveden. f. 428
and abstain from things unlawful; otherwise (said he) the deserved vengeance
of God will come upon thee: the King laid these things to heart, and became
more devout and charitable to the poor, etc.

That I kept silence, and went not out of door] I replied not in defense of
what evil I had done; I cried not, as they use to do in Courts of Justice, Non
feci, Not guilty, I held my tongue, and hid my head.
but, Me, me, ego qui feci, I am verily guilty, and for this cause I went not
out of doors, but kept me at home as much as I might, through shame and grief
for what I had done amiss. This was right: and this seems to me to be the
right Interpretation of the Text among those many others that are brought by
Expositours.

Verse 15. O that one would hear me] Quis det mihi ausoultantem mibi? O that
after all this purging and praising of my selse (wherein I take no pleasure,
but that I must do it, unless I will betray mine innoceney, and lie under
heavy imputations) some one would help me to a fair trial I that God, who is
best able, would undertake the business, and effectually vindicate me from
those calumnies and contumelies that are cast upon me.

That the Almighty would answer me] i. e. That he would give a reason why he
dealt so harshly with me. This was Jobs desire, or mark he aimed at, Hac in re
petenda nimis importunus est. Merl.
with confidence enough: but sure he should have carried the matter with more
modesty and lowly-mindednesse, with more reverence and godly fear, since our God
is a consuming fire; since he is greater then our consciences; neither may we
ever forget the infinite distance and disproportion that is betwixt him and our
selves.

And that mine adversary had written a Book] Heb. The man of my contention;
mine Antagonist, that he had made his declaration, and set down his charge. By
these and the following expressions, Job denotes his innocence and plerophory
of faith, wherewith he was well acquainted, and whereby he was exceedingly
supported. Oh that we could as bravely bear all contumelies and contempts for
our consciences; wearing them as Crowns and confirmations of our conformity to
Christ.

Verse 36. Surely I would take it on my shoulder] As a father does his darling,
or as a Standard Bearer does his Ensign, or as a man carries his most
desirable things out of a common combustion.

And bind it as a Crown to me] Heb. Crowns; I should be very proud of it, as
we use to speak, and take it for a great glory, as not doubting with much ease
and with a trice to confute it; or at least to slight it. The lash of lewd
tongues, it is as impossible to avoid, as necessary to contemn. The best
Apology to such, is that of Isaac to his brother Ishmael, patience and silence.
If any reply be made, it should be like that of the faithful Steward to his
passionate Lord, who called him knave and worse, Your Honor may speak as you
please, but I believe not a word that you say, for I know my self an honest
man. Do well, and hear ill, is written upon heaven gates, said that holy
Martyr. A bad report is the ordinary reward of very well doing, which made
Luther wax proud even of his reproach, as he said himself, Tom. 1. oper. Latin.
p. 311.
Indies magis mihi placeo, superbus fio, quod video nomen pessimum mihi
crescere. I please my self herein every day more and more; I grow even proud of
this, that I hear every day worse and worse for well doing: Surely should such
curres wag their tails and not their tongues, I should suspect mine own
innocence; as Phocion did, when the Athenians liked his Oration. And in another
place he says, Epist ad Nic. Hau^m.
Major est mihi timor in landibus; gandium vero in maledict is and blasphemi^s;
When I am praised, I am afraid all is not well; but when I am reproached and
railed on, it is a joy to me; for this will be accounted to my reckoning at the
last day; this will add weight to my Crown of Glory. Reproaches, as they make
graces more splendent, so they will make glory more radiant: as the more dirty
feet tread and rub, the more luster they give the Figure graven in gold. Hence
Austin, Whosoever (says he) willingly reproacheth me, the same does, though
against his will, add to my reward in heaven. And this I take for a great glory
(says Jerome) all the Heretics rail at me.

Verse 37. I would declare unto him the number of my steps] I would tell him
all that ever I know by my self, and turn him the inside outward, deal
ingenuously with him, and make him my Confessor; and so help him make up his
book. Elice igitur hinc, says Lavater. Hence we may learn so to demean our
selves in all companies and conditions of life, that we may neither be ashamed
to live, nor afraid to d^e; and that we need not care though our greatest
enemies knew of our worst practices, though our faults were written in our
foreheads, as they say. Of Socrates, Pliny says, Not. Hist. l. 7. cap 31 ^ell.
l. 2.
That his name was not the name of a man, but of integrity it self. Of Cato
Major, Paterculus says, that he was free from all humane Vices, and as like to
virtue it self, as might be. Tully says, That he was one of those few that
lived and dyed with glory. How much more truly and boldly may we affirm the
like of Joseph, Moses, Samuel, Daniel, Nehemiah, Paul, who knew nothing by
himself, Melancthon, George Prince of Anhalt, John Bradford, and many other
famous in their generations, whom for their piety and patience, as their
enemies could not but admire, so their friends could never sufficiently extol
then. This is no small help to the Cause, said Erasmus concerning Luther, that
his enemies can find no fault or flaw in his life.

As a Prince would I go near unto him] Id est, Animo hereico and imperterrito,
quippe been sibi conscio; that is, Piscat.
With an heroical spirit, and anundanted courage; I would not shrink back, or
flinch him a jot, as having a clearing chearing conscience that fears no
colors, that would not budg or yield an hair for an Angels Authority, Gal.
1.8. Quasi Princeps, hoc est, animo liberrimo and expositissimo, etc. says
Brentius; As a Prince against whom there is no rising up. I would speak my
mind, and lay open the whole matter of my deportment very freely and fully,
that both present and future ages might judge of it. Of Trajan the Emperor it
is recorded, That he neither hated nor feared any man living. Nicepb. l. 2. c.
40
And of Trajan General to Valens the Arian Emperor, That as he could speak his
mind fitly, so he durst speak it freely. Think the same of Job.

Verse 38 If my Land cry against me] As unjustly gotten: Where we have an
elegant Prosopopeia, not unlike that of the Prophet, Hab. 2.11, 12. where the
stone out of the wall cries out against the Oppressor, and the tignum e ligno,
the beam out of the timber answers it by a woeful antiphony. It has been
noted before, that Goropins will have the English to be called, Angli, because
they were good Anglers, and had skill to lay diverse baits when they fished for
other men's livings. May it be our care to disprove him, Polydor, Virgil.
and to show our selves Angels rather (as Gregory the Great derived us) and our
Land to be Regnum Dei, the Kingdom of God, as it was anciently counted and
called, by the holiness and righteousness exercised amongst us. These two
make up one perfect pair of Compasses, which can take the true latitude of an
upright heart (such as Jobs was, witness this whole Chapter.) The first like
the top of Jacobs Ladder, reaches to heaven: the second, like the foot of the
Ladder, rests on the earth, or rather walks about in a perfect circle of
all such duties as one man owes to another. Job was famous for both, whatever
his friends furmised or suggested to the contrary: He was righteously
religious, and religiously righteous; exercising the first Table of the Law in
the second, and caring to keep always a conscience void of offense toward God
and toward men, Act. 24.16.

Or that the furrows thereof likewise complain] Heb. Weep, scil. As it were,
Siplorant porca
out of a desire after their old right Owner, from whom they are detained, as
was Naboths Vineyard.

Verse 39. If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money] i.e. Not paying
the Laborers their wages, which is a boney sin, Am. 5.12, 13. A crying
cruelty, James 5.4. such as has a woe hanging on the heels of it, Jer. 22.17.
See what sins it is set amongst, and what punishment is awarded to it, Malach.
3.5. Let Laban be guilty of it, Genesis 31.7. but Job protests against it here
with an imprecation.

Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life] That is, the occupiers
thereof, the poor Rent-holders (by racking their rents) to miss of a
subsistence, so that they could not make a living of it with all their labor.
Owners of the Land he calls them improperly; since the Land was his, as in the
former verse: but if he had the propriety, they had the pains, and therefore
should have had a livelihood, as Solomon's Vine-dressers had, Cant. 8.12. but so
had not Pharaohs Laboureres, the poor oppressed Israelites, who toyled like
horses, and yet were held to so hard allowance, that they were weary of their
lives, and their souls were ready to expire, as the Hebrew here has it.
Prisoners pitance many poor Tenants have, such as will neither keep them alive,
nor suffer them to dye.

Verse 40 Let thistles grow in stead of wheat] This was a piece of that first,
(...) Arvum ab Heb. Arur, accursed.
Curse, Genes. 3.18. under which the earth has lain bed-ridden, as it were,
ever since, waiting for the coming of the Son of God, that it may be delivered
from the bondage of corruption, Romans 8.20. and Job wishes it as due to him, Ex
lege Tali^nis, if he should be guilty of the forementioned cruelty, Jam. 2.13.

And cockle in stead of Barley] Lolium and lappae, stinking stuff the word
signifies, as those were stinking grapes, Isaiah 5.2, 4. rotten, corrupted,
(...). Frumentum adustum.
vitiated; and as that was blasted corn, yielding nothing better then dust and
chafe, Mat. 13.25. Whereas Wheat and Barley are the precious fruits of the
earth, James 5.7. whereof when the Metapontines had one year a great corp,
(...) Scrabo.
they dedicated to their god at Delphos, in token of thankfulness, an Harvest
graven in gold.

The words of Job are ended] i.e. His Conference with his three friends, whom
having before silenced, and now for himself sufficiently apologized, he
puts a period to that discourse; having (as Octavius once said to Decius) to
the understanding spoken sufficient, and to the ignorant or obstinate too much,
had he said less.

CHAP. XXXII. Verse 1. So these three men ceased to answer Job]
THey were as quiet as men are on a Sabbath, so the word imports: they had
tired themselves with talking, and now they were resolved to rest them, and the
rather, because they judged there was little good to be done by ought that they
should say; for Job was set.

Because he was righteous in his own eyes] And so there was no more hope of a
fool then of him. Pertinacious they held him and contentious, self-conceited
and opinionate; which indeed was a right character of themselves, if they could
have seen it. He was only constant to himself, and to the truth; whereof he
showed himself a stout and resolute Champion. Only, as every Pomgranate has
some rotten kernels in it; so Job had his frailties his outbursts, caused by
extremity of pain, and excess of passion; for the which these three did him
wrong to give him up for deplored and desperate.

Verse 2. Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu] Or, Then burnt the nose of
Elihu; a Periphrasis of anger, which appears in the nose, eyes, and other
parts of the body; -- Qun enim celaverit ignem? Who can hide fire? The Rabbis
have a saying, that a man shows what he is becos, bechis, becagnas, by his
purse, his cups, and his anger; which if it be rash and unadvised, is a mortal
sin, and not venial, (as the Papists falsely infer from Matthew 5.22.)
dispossessing a man of his wit and reason, and disfiguring his body with
fierinesse of the face, swelling of the veins, stammering of the tongue,
gnashing of the teeth, and many other impotent and unmanly behaviors. Hence
angry men were counseled, in the hear of their fit, to look themselves in a
glass, where they may see themselves swollen like a toad, glowing like a devil,
etc. But Elihues anger was not of this kind. A fire it was, but the (...) of
God, as holy Zeal is called, Cant. 8.6. a most vehement flame, (as it is there
rendered) kindled upon the hearth of his heart by the spirit of judgment and of
burning, Isai. 4.4. and such as many waters could not quench, for this zeal is
the extreme heat of all the affections; and the coals thereof are coals of
fire, Cant. 8.6. only we must see that it burn clear and quick, without all
smoke of sin; wherein, though Elihu somewhat faulted, yet, because he was right
for the main, all was well taken. We are apt to mingle sin with our best
actions, and so to plow with an Ox and an Ass. But God considers whereof we
are made, and graciously lays the finger of mercy on the scars of our sins,
as that Limner in the Story.

Of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite] Descended he was of good parents (
Fortes creantur fortibus and bonis) who gave him a good name, signifying, He is
my God, or, My God is Jehovah; to inmind him of his duty, whereunto we have
need of all helps that may be. His fathers name Barachel, signifies, One whom
God has blessed: He had blessed him indeed in so good a son, as could not but
make him a glad father, Prove. 10.1. The Buzite he is called, either from his
Progenitor Buz, the son of Nahor, who was the brother of Abraham, and had by
Milcah, Huz his firstborn (of whom some think Job came) and Buz his brother,
Genesis 22. 21. Tradit in Genesis
Or else from his country, the City of Buz, a City of Idumea, Jer. 25.23.
Hierom will have this Elihu to be the same with Balaam, who whiles young, was a
Prophet of God, and dealt thus divinely with Job, but afterward being
corrupted by Balac, he became the Devils Spelman. This I look upon as a Jewish
tradition, not much to be credited. His pedigree is here more fully described,
Vt certitudo h^st ria ostenderetur, says Mercer; That we might not doubt of
the truth and certainty of the history so circumstanced: as also, because Elihu
did better then the rest of Jobs friends, who proved no better then Satan's
instruments. How he came to make one amongst them, we know not. It is
conceived, that hearing of the going of the other three by consent to visit
Job, he also went to hear their conferences, not doubting but that he should
thereby very much benefit his understanding But failing in some sort of his
expectation, and finding both parties out in their discourses, he steps forth,
and takes the boldness to interpose as an Arbiter, or Moderator, blaming both
sides, and beginning, in the six following Chapters, that determination of the
difference betwixt them, which God himself will afterward finish. Meanwhile
it is well observed by learned Beza, Beza ^rafa^^ this chap.
that Elihu in blaming Job (as there was cause) does for the most part
interpret Jobs words far otherwise then he meant them; and moreover, that even
in finding fault with those things that were justly to be found fault withal,
he kept not always that moderation that was meet; which is evident to godly
men, and especially such as are of a more earnest nature and disposition; so
hard a thing is it even when we do well, not to offend on the one side or on
the other. But if we consider how far Job, being thereto driven by the
importunity of his Accusers, and his most intolerable calamity, did range out
of the right way, and how we are all given, even to the uttermost, to defend
and maintain our credit and estimation, especially when we are therein touched
by those men, who ought, least of all others to have done the same: We shall
confess, that it was very requisite and necessary for Job rather to be
censured in this sharp manner, as he was, then after any milder sort; to the
end he might the better acknowledge and humble himself before God; as always he
had done, till through the slanderous speeches of his friends, he was drawn
into these altercations.

Of the kindred of Ram ^ E familia Syra, so Tremellius; as if Ram were put for
Aram. The Chaldee says, it is put for Abraham, who was first called R^m.
secondly Abram, thirdly, Abraham. But Elihu was of the family of N^hor, rather
then of Abraham; and Ram seems to have been some famous man of that family.

Because he justified himself rather then God] This he did not directly, and
totidem verbis; but by consequence; and Elihu was kindled at it. It is a
blessed thing to have a stomach for God, and to be blown up in his Cause, as
was Moses Exodus 22. Eliah with his Zelando zelavi, Phinehas, David, Christ,
Job. 3.17. the Angel of Ephesus, Rev 22. To be all on a light fire, with love
to God, and indignation against all that do him any dishonor by word or deed.
J^b had uttered some discontented speeches against God; which reflected upon
his Justice and Goodness; he had also despaired of a restoration, and most
earnestly wished for death, etc. and thereby seemed to justify himself rather
then God; this good Elihu could not brook.

Verse 3. Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled] True zeal is of
a most masculine, dis-ingaged courageous nature: like fire it catches on every
side, and is impartial. Elihu was a man made ^ll of fire, walking among
stub^le. as Ch^ysos^om says of Peter: And surely, he that is not angry against
sin, whether in himself or others, it is because either he knows it not, or
hates it not as he ought. He also kept within the bounds of modesty and
moderation, and expressed himself without bitterness. We read of Idacius,
that he would needs be doing with S^lvianus and Instantius, both
Priscillianists. Sulp. Sever. l. 2. p. 17 1.
But by his passionate and intemperate language, he not only not converted
them, but made them worse.

Because they had found no answer] They were gravelled and non-plust, Act. and
Mon.
as the Popish Doctors were often by the Martyrs, Philpot, Ridley etc. yea by
those of the weaker sort, as Anne Askew. Alice Driver etc. Speed. 11 45. ex
Grafton Hollins^cad, etc.
The Prolocutor in Convocation, Anno 1553 confessed that those dejected
Ministers (afterward Martyrs) had the Word on their side, but the Prelates in
place the possession of the sword, and that was their best answer to the others
Arguments.

And yet had condemned Job] condemned him for a wicked man, as the word
signifies. So the Popish Doctors did innocent Cranmer of Adultery, Heresy and
Treason: Philpo^ of Parricide, Heresy, etc. To accuse was easy, but how
shamefully failed they in the proof? These three after they had also interested
God himself in their rash accusation of Job were forced to give him over.

Verse 4. Now Elihu had waited till Job h^d spoken] Yea, though his speech was
very long, yet he heard him out, though himself were with child to speak.
Broughton renders it, waited to speak with Job; he would not thrust in till
they had all done their discourses. This was his modesty, though a man of
singular abilities. Raram facit virtus cum scientia mixturam: To blame then
surely was Gregory, for thinking so ill, and wrighting so harshly of this good
young man, as if he had been proud, and arrogant: descanting to that purpose
upon his Name, Country, and Kindred.

Because they were elder than he] And therefore ought of right to have the
precedence of speech: though it appears by all that follows, that in this
controversy he saw further into it, judged righter, and rebuked Job with more
gravity, and wisdom then any of them, so that Job was fully convinced, and made
no reply at all: no more than Jo^ah did, when God set him down, chap. 4.11. so
forcible are right words.

Verse 5. When Elihu saw that there was no answer] And therefore Job looked
upon himself, as one that had won the day. St. Austin professes this was it
that heartened him, and made him to triumph in his former Manichisme, that he
met with feeble opponents, and such as his nimble wit was easily able to
over-turn. And when Carolostadius opposed Luthers Consubstantiation but weakly
and insufficiently, Zuinglius said he was sorry, that so good a cause, non
satis humerorum haberet, wanted shoulders.

Then his wrath was kindled] viz. From their coldness; like as Nehem. 3.20.
Baruc repaired earnestly, ( se accendit, he burst out into heat, angry with his
own, and others sloth:) So Elihu here, when he saw that Jobs eloquence
triumphed over their wisdom; and that their silence was a loud acknowledgement
of their defeat, he grew more angry than before; and transported with zeal, he
says ^o them very briskly;

Verse 6. I am young, and ye are very old] Yet was he nothing inferior to any
of them in wit, piety, Niceph.
and learning: he had lived long in a little time, and was (as One says of
Macarius) (...) an old-young-man; as if he had been an Alban-born, qui albo
crine nascuntur, Caniciem habent auspicium capillarum. Solin.
who come into the world hoar-headed, as did Seneca; and thence had his name,
as Cassiodorus thinks, quod canus, quasi senior natus sit. Some young men are
ripe betime, and more ready-headed than their ancients: as David was, Psalm.
119.100. and as Solomon was, a child-King, but very wise: contrarily, his son
and successor Rehoboam entered into the Kingdom at a ripe age; yet Solomon was
the man, and Rehoboam the child. Age is no just measure of wisdom. There are
beard-less sages, and gray headed children. Not the Ancient are wise, but the
wise is Ancient; as Elihu will tell us in the next verses.

Wherefore I was afraid, and durst not show you mine opinion] Heb. My
knowledge; that is, the truth, so far as I understand it; siquid ego ant ^^pio,
ant sapio; if I have any judgment. Thus he delivers himself in modest terms;
using many prefaces. And if hereafter he seem to boast, and set up himself
above the rest, as he does, it is out of his zeal for God, whose honor he
seeks, and not his own. The words here rendered, I was afraid, and to show,
are both Syriack. Elihu, by his family of Ram or Aram, may seem to be that
countryman; and to have a touch of that dialect, as Livy had of his Patavinity.

Verse 7. I said, Days should speak] This seems to have been a Proverb in
those days; and it ran much in Elihu's mind. We use to say, That at meetings
young men should be Mutes, and old men Vowels: Of Arsatius, who succeeded
Chrysostom in the Sea of Constantinople, Antonin. tit. 10. c. 9.
it is recorded (but nothing to his commendation) that at eighty years of age,
he was as eloquent as a Fish, and as nimble as a Frog.

And multitude of years should teach wisdom] Heb. Should make known wisdom: sc.
such as consists in the knowledge of God and of his will, of our selves and
of our duties. This is far beyond all that of the Heathen Sages, of the Seven
wise Men of Greece, (...) Plut.
of Archimedes of Syracuse, who had a name and same, says Plutarch, not of
humane, but of a kind of divine wisdom: So had Socrates, so had Apollonius, of
whom Philostratus says, that he was non doctus, sed natus sapicus, not taught,
but born a wise man. These all were the worlds wizards; and what they came to,
see Romans Instit. l. 3. c. 30.
1. and 1 Cor. 1. and 2. Lactantius truly tells us, in the name of the whole
community of Christians, That all the wisdom of a man consists in this, to
know God and worship him aright. And that these Seniours should have taught and
notified such wisdom, Elihu had well hoped: but it proved otherwise.

Verse 8. But there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty]
Or, Surely there is a spirit in man, but the inspiration, etc. Man has a
reasonable soul, and a natural judgment, whereby he differs from bruit
beasts: And not only so, but some there are that do animam excolere, as Tully
and Aristotle; they improve their natural abilities by art, and so go far
beyond others in worth; differing from the unlearned as much almost, as a man
does from a beast. Lo, such a spirit there is in some men: which yet amounts
not to wisdom, without the concurrence of Gods good spirit to sanctify all, as
the altar sanctifies the gold of the altar. If this be not attained unto, the
wiser any man is, the vainer he proves, Romans 1.22. The Lord knows the
thoughts of those wise (even of the choicest and most picked men amongst them)
that they are vain, 1 Cor. 3.20. And to such we may say, as Austin once wrote
to a man of great parts, Ornari abs te diabolus quarit, the Devil desires to
be tricked up by thee.

And the inspiration of the almighty gives them understanding] He is the wise
man, when all is done, whom (whether old or young) the spirit of God, who acts
most freely, is pleased to imbreath. And although Arts and Age be good helps to
knowledge; yet they must be all taught of God that shall be wise unto
salvation: and such as these, the elder they grow, the wiser they are, for most
part; and if young saints, they become, old angels. True it is, that God is
debtor to none: neither does a longer life, of it self, deserve any thing at
Gods hands: because the longer they live, the more sins they commit. But yet
the promise is, that to him that has shall be given, and he shall abound. The
righteous also shall hold on his way; and he that has clean hands, shall be
stronger and stronger, Job 17.9. Howbeit, some good men's first days, have been
their best days: and they have suffered no small decays in their
spiritual-intellectuals: as did Solomon, Asa, Joash, and perhaps these three
friends of Job, to whom this speech is directed. Certain it is, that he is a
rare and a happy man, of whom it may be said in a spiritual sense (as it was
said of Moses) that after long profession of Religion, his sight (...) waxed
dim, nor his holy heat abated. The Heathen Sages have cause to admonish us, to
take heed of old age: as that which comes not alone, but is it self a disease,
and ever accompanied with many maladies, both of body and mind. Elihu seems
to take this here for granted (experience sealing to it) that true wisdom
depends not upon any man's authority; power, learning, experience, or old age:
but upon the inspiration of the Almighty. And therefore they holy Scriptures
must needs be the storehouse of wisdom, 2. Pet. 1.21. 2 Timothy 3.16.
the Statute-book of Heaven, as being (...), imbreathed by God, as Paul
speaks; the very heart and soul of God, as Gregory.

Verse 9. Great men are not always wise] Rabbis are not the Grandees of the
Earth: they who seem to be somewhat, Gal. 2.6. and take it ill if they be not
so accounted, these are not always wise, or these are none of the wisest. Non
sunt sapientes Magistri. so Brentius reads it. Brent.
Our Masters ( at sunt Magistri nostri Parisienses) have not engrossed all the
wisdom: And why? Spiritus non est alligatus Ra^binorum authoritati, and
magistrorum nostrorum capitiis, etc. the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear
of the Lord, is in no wise bound to such, nor are his gifts held captive by
any, but freely distributed according to the good pleasure of his will, who
works all, and in all. Paphnutius was wiser than the whole Council, John
Wicliffe, than the University of Oxford. Daniel, than all the Magicians of
Babylon. Patres ^gondicum venia. Augustine being oppressed with the authority
of the Fathers, says, he regards not Quis, but Quid; who speaks a thing,
but what he speaks.

Neither do the aged understand judgement] Prudence is not proper to old age:
and though knowledge be the daughter of time, it does not always fall out,
that the most aged, are the most learned. Wisdom does not ever lean upon a
staff, nor look through spectacles. Experience gives us to see both old fools
and young wise men, some of each sort. When the state of Venice once sent two
young men Ambassadors to the Emperor Frederike 4. and he being offended at
their age, refused to admit them, they did him to know, That if the Venetians
had valued men by their gravity and well-grown beards, as the only wise men,
they would, doubtless, have sent on their Embassy, a pair of well-bearded
Goa^es: For, Si prolixa facit sapitnem barba, quid obstat
Barbatus p^ssit quin caper esse Plato?


Verse 10. Therefore I said, Hearken to me. This he speaks by way of apostrophe
to Job, Nunquam a te nisi doctior redeo.
with whom he would fain ingratiate, that he might the better prevail to
convince him of his course dealing with God, whose cause he wholly pleads.
(...) had hoped to have learned much by this conference held by such heads: But
finding it otherwise, T^nominatim and notanter, Job.
he grows to a Semper ego amditor tantum? Hearken to me another while, that God
may hearken to you. Hearken I say, all of you: but thou, Job especially; for
with thee lies my main business.

I also will show mine opinion] He says not my judgment, (that might savor
of arrogance in so young a man) but mine opinion, or knowledge; I will offer my
thoughts, judge you of them as you please. See verse 6. Elihu was far from the
spirit of Bacon the Carmelite, who would endure no guessing, or doubtings and
was therefore called Doctor Resolutissimus; as requiring that every one should
think as he thought: this was too Magisterial.

Verse 11. Behold, I waited for your words] Whilst you had any thing to say, I
was silent, and no way troublesome, or obstreperous. This he speaks to Jobs
friends, who had free liberty to speak whiles they would, without interruption;
and should therefore now be content to hear (though perhaps what they would
not) if God thereby might be glorified, and Job better convinced.

I gave care to your reasons] Heb. To your understandings: Vsque. ad
intelligentias vostras, Vt cum dicitur, Redite usque ad me, Joel. 2.
to the utmost of your best arguments, and most elaborated demonstrations; for
the which you had eviscerated your brains, and well nigh cracks your sconces,
but all to no purpose: since you hover in generals, and, declining that which
was the main matter in question, (like lapwings that cry farthest off from the
nest) you brought only such reasons as were not cogent, and used such
discourses as did me coelum, nec terram attingere, never come at the business:
which was no better then laborious loss of time.

Verse 12. Yea, I attended unto you] Et usque ad vos perpendebam; I thoroughly
weighed your words, and rightly considered them, (as our Mr. Bradshaw was wont
to do at the Ministers meetings, and was there-hence called the Weighing
Divine) that you may not think I answer the matter before I understand it, as
fools do to their shame, Prove 18.13. Sanctius in cap. 40. Ezekiel. in argum.
or that I speak evil of the things I know not, as those in Peter, 2 Epist
2.12. daring to reprehend what I do not comprehend, as did that Popish
Expositour who calls Ezekiels description of the Temple, Insulsam
descriptionem, an absurd description.

And behold there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his
words] And yet they thought they had done both effectually: and that it was
merely his stubbornness, to stand out against them. Ready they were to give him
up for uncounselable; and to turn him over to God with a Non-convertetur, he is
past our cure, we can do no good on him; none but God can put him out of his
good conceit of himself, etc. Out of all this, a good Interpreter makes these
following Conclusions: 1. That we must diligently hear and weigh what things
are spoken by others, before we proceed to censure them. 2. That we must not
pass a censure upon any one part of a speech, but take it all together, ere we
make judgment of it. 3. That when we have weighed every thing well and wisely,
we must not countenance any error; but freely utter what we do truly and
rightly think of it. 4. That we may think things sufficiently refuted by the
learned, which yet had need to be further inquired into. 5. That one younger
man may see further sometimes into a matter, then many others of longer
standing and experience. 6. That men may be esteemed obstinate, and
opinionative, who are nothing less. 7. That multitude and antiquity are but
ciphers in Divinity, etc.

Verse 13. Lost ye should say, we have found out wisdom] Or, See that ye say
not, we need not search out words; as verse 11. For, we have found out wisdom,
rem acu pertigimus, We have hit the nail on the head, and said sufficient to
convince him, if any reason would do it, whilst we affirm that

God thrusts him down (as it were with a thump on the back,) and not man] Who
might do amiss, but so cannot God; who for as much as he fights against Job,
tossing him (as a Tennis ball, or as the wind does a withered leaf) from one
affliction to another, who can doubt but that he holds him a wicked man? This
says Elihu, is a very weak way of reasoning; therefore never please your
selves in it as convincing. Hoc argumentum tam facile dilustur quam vulpes
come pyrum, as one merrily phrased it. There is no judgment to be made of a
person or cause by the good or evil success of things, since none out of hell,
ever suffered more then Gods dearest children: witness that little Book of
Martyrs, Hebr. 11. Neither have any sped better here, then those worst of men,
Turks, Papists, Persecutors, etc.

Verse 14. Now he has not directed his speech against me] And so I have no
particular edge or grudge against him, he has no reason to think that I come
prejudicated or exasperated. This Elihu speaks purposely, to get within Job;
that he might the better persuade with him. We must endeavor to preserve in
the party with whom we would prevail, an opinion of our love and good
affection to him; for else we shall lose all our sweet words, since man is a
cross and crabbed creature; duci vult, trahi non vult; lead him you may, drag
him you must not.

Neither will I answer him with your speeches] But with better: He shall have
from me soft words and hard Arguments; I will come over him in a milder manner,
and to better purpose; whilst, moved merely by a zeal for Gods glory, I shall
show him his miscarriages, not in mine own words, but in Gods. That Is a true
saying of learned Junius, Personatae reprehensiones frigent; plerimumque
interest ex animo omnia, ut conscientia fert animusque, facias; an de industria.

Verse 15. They were amazed] As if they had seen Medusa's head, or some such
terrible spectacle that had rendered them dumb. Talkative enough they have been,
when there was no such necessity; but now that they might speak to some
purpose, they stand like stocks, and are mute as fishes, whereby they bewray
their ignorance and folly. Silence in some cases is sepes sapientiae, as the
Rabbis speak, Pirke aboth.
the fruit and fence of wisdom, Amos 5.13. See the Note there. But withal
there is a sinful silence, which Luther wished never to be found guilty of.
Modo impii silentii non arguar. Luth.
And it is the devil doubtless that gaggeth people, when being called to speak
of, or for God, as these friends of Job were at this time, they answer no more,

They leave speaking.] The desert a good Cause, or betray it by a cowardly
silence. It may be feared the spirit of faith is no indweller, where the door
of the lips move not right, 2 Cor. 4.13. He speaks thus of those three seniors
in a third person, by way of irony and contempt, turning his talk to the
bystanders, whereof its likely, there were many: or (as Tremellius thinks)
to Job, with whom he seeks to ingratiate.

Verse 16 When I had waited, for they spoke not, but stood still] Or, Seeing I
have waited, but they have not spoken, etc. Nothing appears but a dumb show, a
deep silence, such as Elihu much marvelled at, and therefore sets it forth
in many words, all to one purpose. See verse 15.

Verse 17. I said, I will answer also my part] It is a virtue to be forward and
forth putting in that which is good; and a vice to be shye and shame faced. A
Christian should catch at opportunities of doing and receiving good, he should
be ready to every good work: as the busy Be, so soon as ever the Sun breaks
forth, gets abroad to gather honey and wax.

I also will show my opinion] Heb. My knowledge, as verse 6. and so the Vulgar
reads it. Hereupon Gregory taking Elihu, (but not well) for an arrogant
person, shows, that such love to vaunt themselves, and out of ostentation to
set forth their good parts to public view; and are therein like unto a vessel
without a cover, touching which the Law says, that it shall be counted
unclean. Thus He. But to utter a man's knowledge for the benefit of others, as
good Elihu did, is not pride, but zeal, however the world censure it: And they
have, doubtless, an heavy account to make, who hide their talents; and having
a great treasure of rare abilities, will not be drawn to impart them; the
canker of these men's great skill, shall be a swift witness against them. Vile
latens virtus. --

Verse 18. For I am full of matter] Heb. Of words; such as are weighty and
stuffy, steeped in mine understanding (as Plutark says Phocions words were)
and very well digested. I am (...), in very good case to speak; as full of
solid Arguments as the Moon is of light. Whether Elihu speaks this arrogantly
and from the flesh, or from the Spirit, I determine not, says Brentius here.
But sure it is, that such words as these, howsoever they may seem arrogant and
carnal, Possunt tamen esse spiritualissima, yet they may be very spiritual, as
Jer. 4. and 20. And as sure it is, that we should be in company like full
clouds or paps, that pain themselves with fullness, till eased of their milk.

The Spirit within me constrains me] Heb. The spirit of my belly; that is,
Gods Holy Spirit inhabiting mine heart, and exciting me to so good a work: The
love of Christ constrains us, 2 Cor. 5.14. It has not only an impulsive, but
a compulsive faculty. Sicu^ flatus in ventre conclusus magno impetu exitum
quaerit: sic zelus mentis quaerit exitum per sermonem. Pisc.
Rumperer medius, si non erumperet sermo intra me conceptus, as Brentius here
paraphraseth; I should even burst, if I did not vent my conceptions, which
(like a child in the womb at full time, or as wind in the bowels) want room,
and press to come out, Psalm. 39.3. Jer. 20.9.

Verse 19. Behold my belly is as wine which has no vent] By this elegant
similitude, Elihu illustrateth what he had said before; wherein (as Merlin well
observes) he compares words shut up in the mind of him, that would feign
utter them, to new wine, not yet thoroughly purged, the soul to bottles, silence
to the stopple, which keeps in the wine, grief hereupon to the breaking of
those bottles, speech to the opening of them, by taking away the stopple of
silence. And although in this Discourse, Elihu may seem to lay on more words
then the matter requires, yet he does not: for he says no more then the
Psalmist does, Psalm. 45.1. and Jeremiah, chap. 6.11. and the Apostles. Act.
4.20. We cannot but speak, etc. And whereas Gregory says, that all this came
from pride in Elihu, Chrysostom praises him rather (and therein he is in the
right) for his zeal, which will have a vent, or the heart will cleave; as the
waters undermine, when they cannot overflow. As for that which is urged against
Elihu, that God says of him, as of a Reprobate and one whom he knew not, Who
is this that darkneth counsel by words without knowledge? chapter 38.2. It is plain
that God speaks there, not of Elihu, but of Job. and so Job understood and
applied it, chap. 42.2. And that God speaks not of Jobs sacrificing for him,
as for the other three, makes more for his praise then else; and shows, that
he had spoken of God the thing that was right, which they had not done, chap.
42.7.

Verse 20. I will speak that I may be refreshed] Heb. That I may breath; This
many Martyrs did; though to the loss of their precious lives: as those that
came to the Tribunals, and cried out; Christiani sumus, We are Christians, hang
us, burn us, stone us, etc. Modo Jesum nostrum nanciscamur, so that we may get
our Jesus. And when they were told that they were put to death, Non pro fide,
sed pro obstinatione; not for their Religion, but for their obstinacy;
Tertullian answered, Pro hac obstinatione fidei morimur; For this Religious
obstinacy we gladly dye. As for those that made not a good confession, but
either denied or dissembled their Religion, for politic respects, what a deal
of unrest found they in their consciences, till they had better declared
themselves, or revoked their recantations; as Bilney, Bainhum, Benbridg, Abbes,
Sharp, besides Origin, and all those of old? Let a man speak boldly and freely
in a good Cause when called to it, and he shall be refreshed: for as every
flower has its sweet smell, so has every good word and work its comfort.

I will open my lips and answer] Viz. Freely and fully, as Ephesians. 6.19. with
great a lacrity of spirit and vehemence of speech. Some kind of answer a man
may make, though he open not his lips: as he did, who being asked what man's
life was? presently turned his back, and went his way. Theadoret also upon
Matthew. 5.2. observes that our Savior taught sometimes, when yet he opened not
his mouth; viz. by holy life, and wondrous works.

Verse 21. Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person] q.d. This leave you
must give me, or at least wise I must take it, since my life lies upon it to be
impartial and plain-dealing, laying the blame where it lights, and sparing the
pains of pleasing and Parasitical Poems of oratorical, and rhetorical
insinuations. Nihil loquar ad gratiam, etc. I shall know no man after the flesh
in this business, nor look on any face. If Job found this fault with his other
three friends, chap. 13.7. he shall have no cause so to do with me: but as a
right Moderatour, I will hear Arguments speak, and not persons; I will shut out
my friend, or my seniour, and speak the truth in love. Diem hominis non
desideravi, says Jeremy, chap. 17. And if I yet please men, I am no more the
servant of Christ, Gal. 1.10. See the Note there.

Neither let me give flattering Titles] Praenomen aut cognomen, those that
seem to be somewhat, whatsoever they be, it shall make no matter to me; God
accepts no man's person, Gal. 2.6. I shall call a spade, a spade, tell every
one their own without circumlocution, and not sooth or smooth up any man
(though never so great) in his sinful practices. Semper Augustus, In v^^a Alp^on
is a Title still given to the Germane Emperors: But Sigismund, once Emperor
(when a fellow flattered him above measure, and extolled him to the Skies) gave
the Flatterer a good box on the ear, and when he asked, Why swi^^ you me? He
answered, Why clawest thou me?

Verse 22. For I know not to give, etc.] I have as little Art in it ('it is out
of my road) as heart to it: For,

In so doing my Maker should take me away] i.e. Kill me and send me packing to
Hell. He would soon snatch me away: he would burn me, as some render it; so
dangerous is the sin of flattery. A Preacher called Constantine the Great,
Eusebius. de vita Constable. l. 4. c. 4.
Blessed to his face, but he went away with a check. What will God say to such,
think we?

CHAP. XXXIII. Verse 1. Wherefore Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches.
PLain Job, for flattering Titles Elihu would give one, chap. 32.22. only in
prefacing to his Discourses he is very large, witness the whole former
chapter, which may well stand for a common exordium to all the five following;
and the seven first verses of this; wherein he both calls upon Job for
audience, and uses Arguments for that purpose. An Orator he shows himself
all along: for in his Introduction, he has (...), milder affections, which
suit best to insinuate; and toward the conclusion he has (...), pathetical
expressions, that may leave an impression in his Hearers.

And hearken to all my words] And not to some of them only, picking and choosing
what pleases you, and turning a deaf ear to the rest, as he in Tacitus did,
who said, Tulingua, ego aureum dominus; You may say what you please, but I will
hear no more then I like, and lift. This is an evil ear, and must be healed (as
the Orator told his Countrymen) ere any good can be done. The good soul lies
low at Gods feet and says, Speak Lord, for thy servant hears. All that the
Lord our God shall speak unto us, that will we hear and do, Deuteronomy. 5.27. Now
therefore we are all here present before God, to hear all things that are
commanded thee of God, Act. 10.33. It is sign of an honest heart to take the
Precepts; together with the Promises, and to tremble at the threatenings, as
well as to reach after the comforts of Gods holy Word, which last every
hypocrite will be catching at, as children do at Sweetmeats, passing by the
better provision.

Verse (...). Behold now, I have opened my mouth] I have taken upon me to be a
Speaker, an Arbitratour in this Controversy, which is usually a thanklesse
Office; for he who interposeth in businesses of this nature, if he had two
friends before, is likely enough to lose one of them. I must of necessity blame
both parties, however I come off with them. Thy three friends have had their
share in the former Chapter, and now comes thine which shall be found though
sharp, of matters weighty and important, as Psalm. 78.2. Habebis sermonem
serium, and de re gravi: for so much the Hebrews intend by this expression of
opening the mouth. In the Revelation, wherever we read that heaven opened,
some great matter followed: so when such open their mouths as have the Law of
God in their hearts, Psalm (...), a Lucian^ and Aristophane dicun^ur.
37.32. Prove. 31.26. Fools indeed have their mouths ever open, blustering out
whatsoever lies uppermost, rashly and without consideration. But a wise man
weighs his words before he utters them; and speaks not, but for some good
purpose.

My tongue has spoken in my mouth] Heb. In my palate, or under my palate, which
are two chief of those mine I^struments of speech, none of which can well be
wanting Let God be glorified for, and with that peculiar faculty; and let our
praises proceed, not from the palate only, or roof of the mouth, but from the
root of the heart. The voice which is made in the mouth is nothing so sweet, as
that which comes from the bottom of the breast. One Interpreter says, That by
these words, My tongue has spoken in my mouth, Elihu means, that he would
not speak clamorously, but as it were, whisperingly, to his ear, in secret.

Verse 3. My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart] i.e. Out of the
uprightness of my heart, I will deal fairly and faithfully with thee; I will
carve thee a piece of my heart, without doubling or dissembling; and why should
not downright truth please thee, better then a smooth supparasitation? Bees
pass by Roses and Violets, and sit upon Time: so should men rather heed sound
rebukes, though hot and biting, (...)
then flattering discourses, which Solomon fitly calls, The song of fools,
Eccles. 7.5. a Sirens Song. And another calls a flatterer, a courteous
murderer, that kills in kindness, kisseth and kills. Cavete vobis ab
osculo hoc Iscariotic^; Beware of this sweet poison, and covet rather those
faithful wounds of a friend, Prove. 27.6. as David did Psalm. 141 5. And as
Vespasian, who carries this commendation, that he was Patientissimus very, and
as Alphonsus King of Arragon, who complained of this that whereas of every
thing else he had enough, of truth he was very much scanted, there being few
about him that would deal heartily and faithfully without flattery or
partiality.

And my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.] i e Simply and sincerely, plainly
and perspicously I will show my meaning, without either gall or guile; My
Discourse shall be clear and pure from all dross of deceit, as the Original
word signifies. This is a praise proper to Gods holy Word, Psalm. 9, 9 10 11.
Prove. 30.5 And they that handle it, ( Tophshe Torah, Jer. 2.8.) may here learn
not to obtrude their own conceits or conjectures for doctrinal truths; but to
utter demonstrative things, not to hu^kster the Word of God, or corrupt it with
their own mixtures, as Vintners do their Wines; but as of sincerity; but as of
God in the sight of God, etc. 2 Cor. 2.17. Let them not preach one thing, and
practice another, sed animentur moribus praecepta; lest some Hillary complain
as once, That there were many heavenly Doctrines in the peoples ears, that
never yet had been in the Preachers heart.

Verse 4 The Spirit of God has made me] That is, I am Gods Creature no less
then thou art made and maintained by the Word of his power, by the breath of
his mouth; why then may not I utter pure and holy Doctrine? since I also am a
rational Creature; and if the Holy Spirit please to blow upon me, I can turn
about like the mill; if to tune and touch me, I can move to make Music; if to
infuse good notions, I can utter them? Hear me therefore.

And the breath of the Almighty has given me life] This some will have to be a
Metaphor taken from the blowing of glasses into this or that shape. It has
been before noted, Plat de Isid. and Ositid.
That the Egyptians worshipped a god whom they knew not, under the shape of a
man blowing an egg out of his mouth, to signify that he made the round world
by his Word. By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the Host of
them by the breath of his mouth. Psalm. 33.6. Where some well note the mystery
of the Trinity; as others do, not so well, out of this text: by God
understanding the first person; by Almighty, the second; and by the breath of
the Almighty, the third: Sed (...) subtilius, says Mercer.

Verse 5. If thou can answer me] Or, If thou can, do thou answer me. This
bold challenge, and the like confident expressions, (not unlike in appearance
to that of Campian, with his ten unanswerable Reasons, (as he accounted them,)
or that of Sanders, with his forty not probable Reasons, De visib. Monarch.
lib. i 8.
but most solid demonstrations (if men would believe him) to prove, That the
Pope is not Antichrist) has caused one Interpreter, following Gregory, to
censure Elihu, for a palpable Bragadochian, full of pride, and vainglory. This
is an hard saying, and at the best, reverenter glossanda, as he said of the
Potifician Laws. I think this good man is hereby no less mistaken and wronged,
than John Baptist was by Tertullian, who falls foul upon him in three several
places, for that harmless question of his sent to our Savior by two of his
Disciples (whom he sought to settle) Art thou he that should come, etc. Matt.
11.3. as if himself had doubted of the person of the Messiah.

S^^ thy words in order before me stand up] A metaphor from Military matters;
muster up and marshal thine Arguments in good array, and then stand to it: make
good thy ground like a valiant soldier who will rather die for it than stir an
inch. An expression, not unlike this, is that of David, Psalm 5. 3. In the
^urning will I direct (or marshal up) my prayers, and then look u^; be as a Spy
upon a watchtower, to see what speed, and whether I get the day: Military terms
they are both.

Verse 6. Behold, I am according to thy wish] Heb. according to thy mouth. If
the Saints do but open their mouths wide, God will fill them: he will give them
not only the desires of their hearts, but the request of their lips, Psalm 21.2.
fulfill all their counsel, Psalm. 20.4. in that very way, by that very means they
wished it: he fitteth his mercy ad cardinem desia^rii: and lets it be to his,
even as they will. Was it not so with Jo^ here?

In Gods stead] Heb For God, to act and plead for him, and to show how thou
have dealt with him. So Ministers are said to be in Christ's stead, 2 Cor. 5.20.
A great mercy, that he will treat with us by men like our selves.

I also am formed out ^f the clay] Et non ex meliore Into^ffictus, of the same
make and matter with thy self, cut out of the same lump dig'd out of the same
pit. He alludeth to Genesis 2.7. the wonderful formation of those Protoplast, as a
Potter moldeth his Pots, cutting them out of the lump. And the like God does
for men still, by that, viz. (...) that is in the seed, making it prolifical,
and generative

Verse 7. Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid] This, Job had
earnestly desired of God, chap 9 24. and 13.21. and Elihu as a cunning
Disputant, presses him with his own words: I am not, says he, neither is it
fit any mortal man should by his terror and power ravish another of his right
Religion, Giants are called Emim, Formidable, and Nephilim, because men fell
before them through fear.
as some Zanzummims do the meaner sort of people by their belluine greatness:
as the Pope and his Janissaries do the Heretics, as they call those of the
reformed Religion, that will not reneague it: not once hearing what they can
say for themselves. Either you must turn, or burn, say they: This is monstrous
immanity.

Neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee] Brentius renders this verse thus;
Ecce frons mea non terreat te, and inclinatio mea super te non gravet: Behold,
my forehead cannot fright thee: neither can my bowing down upon thee, surcharge
thee. I shall neither brow-beat thee, nor quell thee with my weight, that thou
should refuse to reason the case with me. Periculosum est contra cum
scribere, qui porest proscribere; and illi contradicere, qui p^^^st aqua and
igni interdicere. Its ill meddling with those that are armed with great power,
and can as easily undo a man as bid it be done. I must needs acknowledge you
the better scholar (said Phavorinus the Philosopher to Adrian the Emperor) qui
triginta hab^s legiones, Aelius Spart.
who have thirty Legions at command. But here was no such disparity, or cause
of fear in Job, from his compere, Elihu.

Verse 8. Surely thou have spoken in my hearing] Here begins the Charge, Pro
Plancis.
and it is for words; Quae leviter volant, non leviter violant. Nihil tam
volucre quam maledictum, nihil facilius emittitur, says Cicero; Nothing is so
swift as an evil word, nothing is more easily uttered. But should a man set his
mouth against heaven, and utter error against the Lord, Isa. 32.6? Should he
toss that reverend Name of God to and fro, with such impiety and profaneness,
as if his speech could have no grace, but in his disgrace? as if Augustus
Caesar were dealing with some god Neptune. Lonicer. theatr. historic.
or the three sons trying their Archery at their fathers heart, to see who can
shoot nighest? Surely, as God is the avenger of all such; so an Elihu cannot
hear it, and not be kindled. Good blood will not belly it self, Psalm. 139.20,
21. They speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain:
Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee; I hate them with a perfect hatred
etc. The very Turks have the Christians blaspheming of Christ in execration:
and punish it in their Prisoners, when through impatiency or desperateness they
break out in this kind: What a shame is it then, that our Kanters (that last
brood of Beelzebub) should, till alate, be suffered to affirm, That Christ is a
carnal or fleshly thing: and to contemn him by the notion of The man dying as
Jerusalem, etc? Can we hear these hellish blasphemies without ears tingling,
hearts trembling. etc? When Servetus condemned Zuinglius for his harshness, he
answers, In aliis mansuetus ero, in blasphemiis in Christum, non ita; In
other things I can bear as much as another, but when I hear Christ blasphemed,
I am altogether impatient: for why? in this case patience would be
blockishness, moderation mopishness, toleration cowardice. Madness here is
better than meekness, etc.

Verse 9. I am clean without transgression] Clear as the picked glass, without
defection. Nitidus ego, (...) a Syriaca voce (...) pectere.


I am innocent] Heb. Neat and count, not a hair out of order: as it was
objected to Pompey the great.

Neither is there iniquity in me] Nothing crooked or obtort. But had Elihu ever
heard Job saying thus? Or did not he rather misinterpret his words? Some proud
Monk has been heard to say, Non haheo, Domine, quod mihi ignoscas; I have not
done any thing, Lord, that needs thy pardon. The reporter of Bellarmines life
and death, tells us, that when the Priest came to absolve him, he could not
remember any particular sin he had to confess; till he went back in his
thoughts as far as his youth. But good Job had no such conceit of himself, as
may appear by many passages of his: as chap. 9.2 and verse 20, 21. chap. 14.4.
etc. Only out of the greatness of his grief, and the unkind usuage of his
friends, (who spared not without all reason to revile him as a most wicked and
ungodly liver) he did estsoones cast out some rash and harsh words against God,
(see chap. 10.7. and 16.17. and 23.10, 11. and 27.5) and hence this Accusation
here laid against him as a Perfectist, or selfjustitiary.

Verse 10. Behold, he finds occasions against me] Or, Breaches: he picks
quarrels with me, and would fain find out somewhat in my carriage, wherefore to
break friendship with me, and to break me in pieces. But did Job ever say in
this sort? Not expressly so; but by consequence, and to the same purpose, chap.
9.17. and 13.24. and 14.17. and 16.9. and 19.11.

He counts me for his enemy] This indeed he had said, and somewhat more,
chap. 13.24. and 16.9. and 30.21. as if God of his mere pleasure, had made
cruel wars upon him, and exercised all kind of hostility against him, as a
vanquished enemy. See the Note on chap. 13.24. and 19.11.

Verse 11. He puts my feet in the stocks, etc.] See chap. 13.27. and 14.16.
with the Notes.

Verse 12. Behold, in this thou art not just] In this thy Expostulation with
God, as if he had dealt unjustly with thee, (think the same of thy postulation,
or unreasonable request, that God should give thee a reason why he so
grievously afflicts thee, verse 13.) thou art nothing less then what thou
hold thy self to be, viz. just, pure, innocent. Sorex suo perit indicio, the
Mole betrays himself by casting up the mould: and so do thou, good Job, by
throwing forth words without wisdom, as God himself will once tell thee, chap.
38.2. Can thou be just, whose words are thus unjust? Never think it. Thus
Elihu is as nimble with Job (but far more ingenuous) as that Jesuit was with
Drusius: whom when he had called Heretic, and Drusius in his own defense
alleged that Heresy must be in fundamentis fidei; the Jesuit replied, That
even that Assertion of his was Heresy.

I will answer thee, that God is greater than men] Long superat fri^olum
hominem, say the Tigurines, is far above sorry man; the distance and
disproportion is infinite. But how is this an answer to Jobs justifying
himself, and complaining of God, as over-rigid? Gods greatness here is not to
be understood of his power only, (which yet should overawe us when ready to
rise up against him) but also of his truth, wisdom, justice, goodness, etc.
all which Job, by his complaints, seemed to question, and quarrel with; and is
therefore fitly minded of this Attribute of Almighty God, who is glorious in
holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders. Great he is without quantity;
good, without quality; everlasting, without time; omnipresent, without place;
containing all things, without extent. Exodus 15.11.
He is not only great, Psalm. 77.13. but greater, as here; greatest, Psalm. 95.3.
greatness it self, Psalm. 145.3. So he is not only good, Psalm. 106.1. but
better, Psalm. 108.9. best of all, Phil. 1.23. goodness it self, Matthew. 19.17.
The least glimpse of this knowledge, is worth all the gleames of humane
wisdom. And albeit this is a truth commonly known and acknowledged, yet very
few are affected with it aright, as appears by their crossecarriages toward
this great God, and malapert misdemeanors, as if he were such another as
themselves, Psalm. 50.21. Certainly, if we were thoroughly persuaded of Gods
infinite greatness, so as it is set forth, Deuteronomy, 10.17. and elsewhere, we would
much more fear to offend him, and care to please him, then we do. The truth is,
all the exorbitances in men's lives proceed from the weakness of this spring:
and were they but well assured that God is Almighty, they would walk before
him, and be upright, Genesis 17.1. But to this none can attain, but by the help of
supernatural Grace.

Verse 13. Why do thou strive against him?] Why do thou cample and reason
it thus unreverently with God, whose will alone is the supreme reason, nec
recta sclum, sed and ipsaregula; and not only right, but the very rule of
right? He may better say than any Constantine, that Arrian Emperor, Quod ego
volo, pro Canons sit, Let my will be your sovereign rule; since things are
therefore right because I will them; I will them not, because they are right.
Who then art thou, O man, that reply against God, says St. Paul; that
chattest and wordest it with him, that answerest again, and think to hold
him to it, and be hard enough for him? Romans 9.20. Woe unto him that striveth
with his Maker: let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth, Isai.
49.9. Let men learn to meddle with their match, and not to contend with God,
who is much mightier then they, Eccles. 6.10. and has assured them that with
the froward he will wrestle, Psalm. 18.26. Jeremy, who in his distemper, would
needs reason the case with God concerning his judgments (which are sometimes
secret, but always just) did well and wisely to preface thus; Righteous art
thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee, Jer. 12.1.

For be gives not account of any of his matters] Heb. Of all his matters; for
he is (...), the most Highest; and therefore not to be reckoned with by any for
ought he does. If he so far abase himself; as to give account of any of his
proceedings for our satisfaction, it is dignatio stupenda, a wonderful
condescension. Vatablus renders the text thus, Non tuim ^mni^ verba sua
loquitur; for he utters nor all his words: that is, he reveals not all his
secrets, q.d. he does all for our good, though we, for present, understand it
not. He often answers us as the Echo does the voice, cutting off the one half
of it: but stand a while, and see the salvation of the Lord, he is usually
better to his people than their conceits: and delights to help those that are
forsaken of their hopes.

Verse 14. For God speaks once, yea twice] He loves to fore signify: and
although not bound to it, yet he usually gives warning; as not willing that any
should perish, but that all should come to repentance, 2 Pet. 3.9 For which
purpose, God, says Elihu here, uses two ways to nurture his Children; the
one more mild, to keep them from falling into sin, verse 15.16, 17, 18. the
other more rigorous, when they have committed wickedness, to bring them to
amendment of life, verse 19, 20, 21, etc.

Yet man perceives it not] Pra crassitis, and supinitate (ut ita dicam) sua;
through his forlorn dullness and heedlesness, his singular oscitancy and
inadvertency. Though God say as once, O generation, see ye the Word of the
Lord, Jer. 2.31. Hear ye the rod, and who has appointed it, Mic. 6.9. yet man
is not only naturally averse, but adverse, to listen, or lay to heart any
thing, till it light on his hide, to believe till he feels, yea, to his
natural dullness, he soon adds an habitual hardness to his sinews of iron,
brows of brass, Isai. 48.4. this is fearful, Act. 28.27. and yet common to all,
whose hard hearts God is not pleased to soften with the oil of his Grace, and
to soak in the blood of his Son, that they may be supple and soluble.

Verse 15. In a dream, in a vision of the night, etc.] At sundry times, and in
diverse manners. God delivered his mind to men of old by dreams in the night, by
visions in the daytime, imprinting upon their minds what by them he would have
understood, or uttered to others. This he did especially before the Law
written, whereof therefore here is made no mention: See Numb. 12.6. Indeed with
Moses, by a specialty of his favor, he spoke mouth to mouth; even apparently
(as a man does to his friend) and not in dark speeches: the similitude of the
Lord did he behold, sed non absque aliquo Majestatis ejus involuero, but not
without some over-shadowing of his Majesty, which none can see and live, Exodus
33.20. he must needs be oppressed and swallowed up of it, as the sight of the
eye is dazzled with the Sun, or a crystal-glass broken with the fire.

When deep sleep falls upon men, in slumbrings upon the bed] When men plunged
in sleep, are neither in the number of the living, nor the dead. Then many
times the reasonable soul comes into the shop of Fantasy, and there does
strange works, which are vented in our dreams. And sometimes God by an Angel, or
otherwise, causes men to dream, and thereby admonishes them of weighty
matters: as he did Abimelech, Genesis 20. Jacob, Genesis 28. Joseph, Genesis 40. the
other Joseph, Matthew 1. and 2. the Wisemen, Matthew. 2. Pilates wife, Mat. 27.
which though some think it came from the Devil to hinder man's Redemption; yet
others think it came from God, for the clearing of Christ's innocence: and, as
Theophylact holds, for the salvation of this woman's soul. (...) Of the
several sorts of dreams natural, divine, and diabolical: see the Annotations on
Genesis 20.3.

Verse 16. Then he opene^h the ears of men] He makes the bore bigger as it
were, that good counsel may enter; he calls up the ears of the soul to the
ears of the body, that one sound may pierce both: he says, as to him in the
Gospel, Epphata; and together with his word there goes forth a power, as Luke
4.32. See chap. 36.10, 15.

And seals their instruction] Or, Their correction, for they go together,
Psalm. 94.12. Prove. 3.12, 13. and 6.23. and God se^leth, or sets on the one
by the other: as when a Schoolmaster would have a lesson learned indeed, he
sets it on with a whipping. Luther says, that many of St Paul's Epistles could
not be understood, but by the cross, Vexatio dat intellectum. Another grave
Divine gives this good advice; To find out the sin that God afflicts for,
consider what truths have been pressed upon your hearts, before the affliction:
for afflictions use to come as seals to instruction: before they did not come
with power to your hearts; now God seals them: Thus he Bernard says concerning
his brother, when he gave him many good instructions; and he, being a soldier,
minded them not: he put his finger to his sides, and said, One day a spear
shall make way to this heart of thine for instructions and admonitions to
enter. The Tigurine translation is full and elegant, Tunc aurem hominibus
velli^, and disciplinam little velut impresso sigillo consignat. Then he pulls
men by the ear, and consigneth their instruction, as with a seal set unto it.

Verse 17. That he may withdraw man from his purpose] Or, rather, practice;
Heb. Work, that is, evil work, called a man's own work, Heb 4.10. for when we do
evil, we work de nostro, and secundum hominem, 1 Cor. 3.3. as when the Devil
speaks a lie, he speaks of his own, Joh. 8.44. Now from such bad work God
takes men off, by dreams sometimes, as he did Abimelech, Genesis 20.3. and Laban,
Genesis 31.24. but more frequently by corrections of instruction, which are the
way of life, Prove. 6.23. Christianorum Theologia, as Luther calls it,
Virtutum officina, as (...); Bonorum omnium thes^^rus, as Bre^^ius upon this
text.

And hide pride from (...)] Which else, as a Master-pock, will break out in his
forehead, and testify to his face. By Pride we may understand all other sins,
which God both covers and (...) in his penitent people: but pride i^ fitly
instanced, because it was one of the first sins, and is still the root and
source of all other sins. God therefore humbles all his under his mighty hand,
and preserves them from the perilous pinnacle of self exaltation: as he dealt
with Paul, both when he met him on the way to Damascus, and unhorst him; as
also when by that thorn in the flesh, he let out the imposthumated matter of
pride out of his heart, which might else have broken forth into odious and
loathsome practices.

Verse 18. He keeps back his soul from the pit] Or, That he may keep back his
soul, that is, his body, as Psalm. 16.10. Lev. 21.1. from the pit; i.e. from the
grave, or from the pit-fals made for him by his enemies. A penitent person
redeemeth his own sorrows, and provideth for his own safety, Psalm. 91. and
accordingly some read it, He shall keep back his own soul, etc.

And his life from perishing by the sword] Whether by the sword of God or man,
he shall be extra jactum, out of the gunshot or danger of any death, whether
corporal or eternal. The universal Antidote for all the judgments of God, is,
our humble repentance. Aaron escaped by it, when Miriam was smitten with
Leprosy. Per miserere mei, tollitur ira Dei. This is the Rainbow, which if
God see shining in our hearts, he will never drown our souls. Jehosaphat by
this escaped the edge of the sword. David and his poor sheep the stroke of the
punishing Angel; all the crowned Saints now in heaven the damnation of hell,
etc.

Verse 19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed] He is chastened or
chidden; for all diseases are vocal: they are real reprehensions. Coarguitur
dolor.
As God is said to hold his peace, when he punishes not, Psalm. 50.21. Isai.
42.14. so to preach and reprove when he does, Isai. 26.9. and 28.19. Thus God
by chastening David, instructed him every morning, Psalm. 73.14. His reins also
taught him in the night season. Sickness (says one) is the shop of virtue. It
is morum disciplina, felicit at is meditatorium, voluntatis Dei Schola; says
another. King Alfred found it so, and therefore besought God, to send him ever
and anon some fit of sickness; for that (says he) I ever find my self best
when worst, best in soul, when worst in body, the sickness of this is a
medicine to that.

And the multitude of his bones with strong pain] Some read it, Et lis est
^ssium ejus vehemens, his bones rattle in his skin, as we say. Confer Psalm.
38.4. He is all over so ill at ease, that live he would not, dye he cannot; his
pain piercing even to his very bones, and drinking up his marrow, as Jobs did:
all this Discouse being exemplified in him, save that we find not that he kept
his bed.

Verse 20. So that his life abhors bread] Which is the staff of man's life,
and by the Latins called Panis, of the Greek (...), as if it were all in all.
This the sick man v^lut sordidum abominatur, abhors as some filthy thing (so
the Original word here signifies,) he nauseateth, and cannot away with it,
though made of the Kidneyes of wheat, as Moses phraseth it; he brooks it no
better then if it were made of saw dust, or mixed with gravel, or made with man's
dung, as that in Ezekiel.

And his soul dainty meats] Heb. Meats of desire: Those Dainties which he once
sought so passionately, and fed upon so eagerly, he finds no more relish in,
then in the white of an egg or a dry chip; yea, they are no less horrid to
him then rank poison. See a like description of a sick person, Psalm. 107.18.
which seems to be taken from hence.

Verse 21. His flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen] He that was
habilior paulo, corpulent and well lined within, as we say, is so pined with
long sickness, that you can hardly know him for the same man, and he may well
cry out with the Prophet, My leanness, my leanness! Of Christ it is said,
(though not through sickness) that he had no form nor comeliness, (and yet he
was the fairest amongst men, Psalm. 45.2.) through grief and sufferances,
neither was there any beauty left that we should desire him, for his outside,
Isai. 53.2. And of Mr. Fox the Martyrologue, it is reported, that having with
infinite pains finished that elaborate Work of his, the Acts and Monuments of
the Church, in eleven years space, never using the help of any other man, Mr
Clark in his Life.
he grew thereupon so lean and withered, that his friends know him not. Now if
sorrow and hard study will so macerate a man, what marvel if long and sharp
sickness, and thereby extreme stomacklesnesse cause leanness and deformity?

And his bones that were not seen] But could hardly be felt for flesh and fat;
now they stick out as in an Anatomy, so that you may count them, as also the
veins and sinews; his body is become a very bag of bones, a skin-bottle in
the smoke, as David has it.

Verse 22 Yea his soul draws near unto the grave] His soul, that is, His
body, as ver. 18. for Elihu was no Mortallist, neither dreamt he of a
Psychopannychia. He is in the very confines of death, and no ways likely to
recover, he is free among the dead as the Psalmist has it.

And his life to the destroyers] Lethalibus malis, to deadly evils, says
Tr^mellius. Mortiferis; i.e. Morbis, to those messengers of death, deadly
Diseases, says Vatablus. To those that kill; viz. Gentiles multa de Parcis
fabulati sunt.
to the Angels, by whom God sometimes destroys men, as 2 Samuel 24.16, 17.
says Piscator. To enemies, say other. Pollinctoribus to the Bier-carryers, say
the Tigurines, and so Beza paraphraseth: so that he stands not in need of any
remedy or help of any thing more, then of those who should carry his carcass
unto the grave.

Verse 23. If there be a messenger with him] An Angel say some: but one man may
be an Angel to another, as Bradford was to Dr. Tailor Martyr, who usually
called him. That Angel of God John Bradford. If some Prophet or Teacher sent of
God (See Judge. 2.1. Mal. 3.1. Rev. 1.20) to the sick man, who sees his face as
the face of an Angel, and receives him as an Angel, yea as Christ himself,
Gal. 4. in whose stead he is, 2 Cor. 5.20. bringing the Embassage of
reconciliation, ibid. then which what can be more acceptable?

An Interpreter] scil Of Gods holy Will, who may assure the sick party that it
is God who visits him in very faithfulness, that he may be true to his soul;
that he does it in mercy and in measure, not to ruin him, but to reduce him by
repentance from dead works, and by faith in Christ Jesus, etc. who may also set
him in a course, and pray for him, as James 5.16. Dr. Usher tells us, that even
in the times of Popery, amongst our forefathers, the ordinary instruction
appointed to be given to men upon their deathbeds was, that they should look
to come to glory, not by their own merits, but by the virtue and merit of the
Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ; that they should place their whole confidence
in his death only, and in no other thing: and that they should interpose his
death betwixt God and their sins, betwixt them and Gods anger. Sermon. on Ephesians.
4.13.
This was right, and considering the times, admirable. This was better then
that blasphemous direction they give elsewhere to dying men to say, Conjunge
D^mine, etc Conjoyn, O Lord, mine obedience to all those things which Christ
suffered for me, etc.

One among a thousand] Vnus e millibus, not Vnus e similibus; as the Vulgar
Latin has it by a gross mistake, such as that Translation has many. One
among a thousand, he is said to be, for the scarcity of such as can time a
word, comfort the afflicted conscience, and speak to the heart of a poor
distressed Creature, who labors under the sense of sin, and fear of wrath. O
quam hoc non est omnium; This very few can skill of. Luther, who was excellent
at it himself, tells us, That it is a work every whit as hard, as to raise
the dead to life again. Go ye rather to them that sell (said the wise to the
foolish Virgins) and those are rare; scil* such faithful and wise distributers
of Gods grace, Isaiah 50.4
as having the tongue of the Learned, and being instructed for that purpose to
the Kingdom of heaven, can comfort the feeble minded, shore up and support the
weak, etc. such a choice man is worth his weight in gold; and O how beautiful
are his feet, Angelical his face!

To declare ^n o man his uprightnesse] Or, His Righteousness, that is, Either
the righteousness of Christ who is his peace; or His, that is, the
righteousness of his own experience, how he has been raised and received to
mercy. Or, His, to clear up to him his spiritual estate, and show his
evangelical righteousness, consisting more in purpose then in practice; in
confession of our imperfection, then in any perfection we can attain unto. It
is not so much our inherent righteousness, in regard of the worth, dignity and
excellency of it, much less purity and perfection in it, but as it is a fruit
of Gods love and token of his favor, a sign of our Adoption and
Justification, and a pledge of our glorification, that yields comfort. And
this it will do, when skilfully made out to a poor soul by a godly Minister,
and set on by the hand of that holy Spirit, whereby the Saints are sealed to
the day of Redemption, Ephesians. 4.30. and 1.13.

Verse 24. Then is he gracious unto him, and saith] If the sick man, thus
counseled and comforted, repent and believe the Gospel, delivering himself up
to God, and to that his Messenger by the will of God, Mercy and Truth shall be
with him, he shall be cured on both sides, as that Palsy man was, Matthew. 9.2.
the Lord shall raise him up, if it may stand with his eternal welfare. But
howsoever, if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him, James 5.15.
Both the guilt and filth of them shall be taken away, so that he shall be able
to look death in the face with everlasting comfort, as being made to him ^anua
vitae, porta coeli; a postern to let out temporal, but a street door to let in
eternal life.

Deliver him from going down to the pit] Tell him from me, that he shall not
dye, but live, and declare the works of the Lord, as Psalm. 118.17. Nay, say to
this righteous man, tell him so from me, that it shall be well with him, and
very well, Isai. 3.10. Redeem him from going down to the infernal pit: that is,
declare that Redemption to him wrought for him by Christ, and apply it to his
conscience, power the oil of grace into his broken vessel, and assure him in
mine name, and by mine Authority, that I am his salvation. Whose sins soever
ye, my faithful Ministers remit, they are remitted unto them; and whatsoever ye
loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven, Matthew. 18.^8 Joh. 20.23. But all
this ministerially and declaratively, not absolutely and out of a full liberty
and power, as Popish Priests arrogate. Mr. Ley his Pattern of Piety. 145.
I have known one (says a very grave Divine) who neither by education or
affection was disposed to Popery, who having the ill hap (when his conscience
was perplexed) to fall into the hands of a Popish Priest, upon this reason,
(because (as the Priest suggested) that Religion afforded more comfort, because
it had, and exercised, a power to pardon sin, which our Ministers neither did,
or durst assume unto themselves) he became a Papist. But it is honor enough to
Ministers (and may be comfort enough to their hearers,) that God gives them
commission to deliver a penitent man from hell; not as the Means (for that is
Christ alone) but as Instruments, 1. To apply Christ crucified, or rather risen
again unto him. 2. To pronounce his safety and salvation upon the due use of
that means. And this is the greatest honor that ever was done to any mere
creature. Angels never had such a Commission. They indeed are Ministers for the
good of those that shall be heirs of salvation, Heb. 1.14. But Ministers are
called Saviors, Obad. 21. 1 Timothy 4.16. Jam. 3.20.

I have found a ransom] Or, An atonement; a cover for his sin; as a thing is
covered with plaster; or as under the Law, the Ark covered the Decalogue, the
Mercy Seat upon it, and over them two Cherubims covering one another; all which
showed Christ covering the Curses of the Law, and expiating the sins of his
people, which things the Angels desire to pry into, as into the patterns of
Gods deep wisdom, who has found out such a ransom, which he now professes to
accept for this penitent man, 1 Timothy 2.6. Psalm. 32.1.

Verse 25 His flesh shall be fresher then a childs] Tender and smooth, full of
good blood and fresh spirits, he shall be battle and blithe like a suckling. See
a like Hyperbole concerning Naaman the Syrian restored to health, 2 Kings 5.24.
implying, that his disease was thoroughly cured, and his flesh in better case
then ever. There is a memorable story in the Acts and Monuments of the Church,
which here may not unfitly be inserted, to show the sweet fruits of remission
of sins by the free mercy of God. In the dungeon with P^trus Bergerius at Lions
in France, was a certain thief and Malefactor, who had lain in the dungeon the
space of seven or eight months. This thief for pain and torment cried out of
God, and cursed his Parents that begat him, being almost eaten up with lice,
miserably handled; and fed with such bread as dogs and horses had refused to
eat. So it pleased the goodness of the Almighty, that through the teaching and
prayer of this Bergerius, he was brought to repentance and the knowledge of
God, learning much comfort and patience by the word of the Gospel preached unto
him. Touching his conversion, himself wrote a sweet Letter to some friends,
declaring therein that the next day after he had taken hold of the Gospel and
framed himself to patience according to the same, Act. and Mon^f. 828.
his lice (which he could pluck out before by twenty at once betwixt his
fingers) now were so gone from him, that he had not once; his rotten flesh (the
Vulgar translateth this Text thus, Consumpta est ejus caro a suppliciis) was
recruited, and the Alms of good people so extended toward him, that he was fed
with white bred, and that which was very good. His name was John Chambone.

He shall return to the days of his youth] Rejuvenescet, He shall grow young
again, and renew his youth, like the Eagles, Psalm. 103.4. He shall be vigorous
and active, as Isai. 40 31.

Verse 26. He shall pray unto God, and he will be favorable unto him] All
former unkindnesses notwithstanding. God will cast his sins into the bottom of
the sea, and be as propitious to the poor sinner now reconciled, recovered, and
making request, as if he had never been offended by him. Amongst men,
Reconciliationes sunt vulpinae amicitiae, Reconciliations are for the most part
Fox-like friendships; and there is little trust to them. Not so betwixt God and
men: witness Peter, of whom Christ thought no whit the worse for his threefold
denial of him, when once he wept bitterly, and prayed for pardon. Mark 16.
James 2.5
Go tell the Disciples, and Peter, that I am risen. If any man want wisdom, or
any other good thing else, let him ask it of God, who gives unto all men
liberally, and hitteth no man in the teeth, either with his present weaknesses,
or bypast wickednesses. Ambros. in Psa.
Imo plus est propemodum a vitiis se revocasse, quam vitia ipsa nescivisse,
says a Father. Penitence is (in a manner) as good as Innocence.

He shall see his face with joy] Or, Ostendet ei faciem suam in jubilo.
God shall make him to see his face with joy, even with joyful acclamation,
when he shall find himself possessed of Gods Kingdom, which consists in
Righteousness and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost; which Chrysostom^ rightly
calls (...), heaven before hand.

For he will render unto man his righteousnesse] Which he had lost by falling
into sin, as Ezekiel. 18.24. Understand it of degrees and measures: for true grace
cannot wholly be lost. Rursus eum in album justorum and piorum referet. Lav.
Or he will render unto him now in Christ, that righteousness he lost in Adam,
he will fully and freely justify him, and sweetly seal him up to the day of
Redemption; the former falling out shall be but a renewing of love; as it was
betwixt Christ and his Spouse, Cant. 5 and 6.

Verse 27. He looks upon men] He looks to see when any will repent and
return unto him. Now Christ's looks are often operative, and cause that which he
looks after. A stroke from guilt broke Judas heart into despair; but a look
from Christ, broke Peter's heart into tears.

And if any say, I have sinned] so he say it penitently, as David and the
Prodigal; and not fainedly, as Saul; or forcedly, as Pharaoh; or desperately,
as Judas. In men's Courts, says Quintillian, its best to say, Non feci, to
plead, Not guilty: but in Gods Court its better to say, Ego feci, Guilty, Lord;
Mercy Lord; and not to put God to his proofs, as they did, Jer. 2.35. since he
that hides his sins shall not prosper, but he that confesses and forsakes
them shall find mercy, Prove. 28.13.

And perverted that which was right] Thus the true penitentiary lays load
upon himself, and aggravateth his sins, whereof (says Merlin) we have here a
definition answerable to that of St. John, 1 Epist. 3 4. Sin is the
transgression of the Law. I have writhed from the rights, says He in the Text.
I have turned aside to crooked ways, and so have deserved to be led forth with
the workers of iniquity, Psalm. 125.5. As Cattle are to the slaughter, or
malefactors to execution.

And it profited me not] Sin is an ill Play Master, and sends home all her
servants by weeping cross. The best that can come of it, is shame, Romans 6.21.
and godly sorrow working repentance, 2 Cor. 7.10. but usually the end of these
things is death: this is the just hire of the least sin, Romans 6.23. It not only
profits not (what ever it promises) but prejudiceth and proves pernicious.
This penitent man thanks his sin for his late sickness, and yet thinks he has
escaped fair too: for so some render the Text, Non aquale fuit
Nec poenas condiguas dedi, My punishment has been less then men offense. See
Ezra 9.13. with the Note there.

Ver. 28. He will deliver his soul from going, etc.] God will heal him, and
lengthen out his life. Or the sick man will, by his unfeigned repentance,
procure his own reprieve and deliverance from deadly danger. Some make these
words to be the sick man's thankful confession, He has redeemed my soul, etc.
not unlike that of David, Psalm. 116.8. and that of Hezekiah, Isai. 38.17.

And his life shall see the light] He shall not only live, but live happily and
comfortably: a joylesse life is no life.

Verse 29. Lo all these things works God oftentimes] Heb. Twice, thrice, such
is his patience, that he tries all conclusions, as it were, and beats long
with men's evil manners: one while casting them down, and making them believe he
will pitch them into hell; and another while raising them up again, and
restoring them, that if nothing will do he may pay them all at once for the new
and the old, as he did ha^, and Pharaoh, and Nineveh, because they despised the
riches of his goodness; and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing, or
not weighing, that the goodness of God should have led them to repentance. Romans
2.4, 5. Woe be to him, that will not be warned at the first, second or third
time. See Am. 1.3. and 2.1. etc. with the Notes. R. Solomon would thence infer,
That God pardons a man only thrice, and then if he take not warning, to hell
he must: and this he thinks to be Elihu's meaning ^here. But this is to limit
the Holy One of Israel, who ^^ltiplyeth pardon, as we multiply sin, Isai.
55.7. and further adds, for our comfort, verse. 8. That his thoughts are not
our thoughts, nor his ways our ways; but as the heavens are higher then the
earth, etc. We are apt to measure God by our models, to cast him into a
dishonorable should, and to think him like our selves in Mercy, Power, and
other of his Attri^^tes. Xen^phanes was wont to say, that if the creatures were
put to paint the Creator, they would surely conceit him to be like themselves,
because a creature cannot think of any thing higher then a creature. So deal^
we for the most part with Almighty God. But he is God and not man: he is
Jehovah that changes not, neither is there any God like unto him for pardoning
iniquity, not once but often, Micah 7.8 9. See the Note there. He who
commands us to forgive an offending brother seventy times seven times in a
day, if he say, It repents me; What will not himself do in such a case?

Verse 30 To bring back his soul from the pit] i. e. That he may save him from
temporal and eternal destruction, which is the most excellent fruit of
affliction sanctified. We are judged of the Lord, that we may not be condemned
with the world. So that a Saint may say, Periissem nisi periissem, I had been
undone, had I not been undone.

Far minora volo, ne graviora ferans. To be enlightened with the light of the
living] To live comfortably, Cons^icu^s sit inter homines. Mercer.
and to be famous among the Saints; who had they not been reduced by
affliction, would have perished infamous and obscure, wrapped up in the sheet of
shame, and going out in a snuff.

Verse 31. Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me] For I speak from God, and for
God. It was a good speech of Austin to Manicheus, contesting with him for
audience. Hear me, hear me, said Manicheus. Nay, says Austin, Nec ego te, nec
tu me, sed ambo audiamus Apostolum, dicentem, Peccatum non cognovi, etc.
Neither will I hear thee, nor do thou hear me, but let us both hear the
Apostle, saying, I had not known lust, etc.

Verse 32. If thou have any thing to say, answer me] Heb. If thou have words,
yet not empty words, but such as may bear weight, and make for thy defense.
(...) Verba habet (...) rebus Erasmus*
Some men's discourses are nothing else but words. Hermodorus of old was said to
^ell words for want of better Commodities. Erasmus was noted for a very wordy
man. Turrian for a great Trifler; Corniculas citius in Africa, quam res
ration^sque solidas in ejus scriptis reperias, says one. Elihu would have no
such words, nor any wise man else; for they are very irksome, yea vexatious

Speak, for I desire to justify thee] Not to condemn thee, as these three
have done: but to hear thee and clear thee as much as may be. This was fair
dealing. Some are so eristical and teasty, that they will not hear the adverse
party or bear with any that dissent: as the Jesuits, many fierce Lutherans, yea
Luther himself, as appears by his bitter invectives against Carolostaeaius,
Zuinglius, all the Helvetian Churches, that would not receive the Doctrine of
Consubstantiation. -- Tantane animis coelestibus irae? He would not once hear
the contrary party, nor read their Books, but called them Arch Devils, and all
that ever was naught, as he does in his Epistle to the Senate of Frankford.

Verse 33. If not, hearken unto me] Elihu is much in calling for attention: so
are all the Prophets, and Christ the Arch Prophet, as Matthew. 13.9. where,
although it might seem superfluous to stir up such to hear, as had come from
all parts for that purpose, and now hung upon his holy lips, as the babe does
on the breast, Luke 12. ult. yet he well knowing our heedlesnesse and
fickleness, does it once and again, leaving all Ministers an example to do
likewise.

Hold thy peace] Viz. Whiles I am speaking, interrupt me not, but have
patience. Some men, as they have fell in aure, gall in their ears (as some
Creatures are said to have) so they have fire in their tongues, which they
presently spit at all that offend them in the least.

And I shall teach thee wisdom] A good inducement to thee to hear: I will not
trouble thee with trifles, nor detain thee with endless and needless
discourses; but set before thee Gods wise procedings, and bring thee to such a
sight of thine own folly, as shall render thee restless till set right for
heaven.

CHAP. XXXIV. Verse 1. Furthermore Elihu answered and said.]
i. e. HE prosecuted his former Discourse, Pronunci^ns itaque Eliu. Elihu going
on still in his anger and speech.
he thus pronounced (as the Vulgar has it) in answer to some of Jobs former
speeches, which he here recites, but not so heartily; and refelleth, but not
so mildly, as was meet. True it is, that Job in his heat had let fall very many
lavish and inconsiderate speeches, as is to be seen almost throughout the tenth
Chapter. But yet it was far from him ever to say either that himself was
without sin, or that God was unjust, as Elihu would bear him down; very
odiously taking up certain sayings of his, that way sounding, and very gravely
calling forth the rest there present to give sentence with him against Job. Yet
is not Elihu to be censured for a proud, arrogant person (as some make him) but
to be esteemed, Sapiens and egregius vir, as Lavater here styles him, a wise
and excellent man: though he should have considered, That the Spirit of God is
neque mendax, neque mordax, a Spirit of truth and of meekness.

Verse 2. Hear my words, O ye wise men] And those are not many, Hos. 14.9. He
excludes poor Job, whom yet he had promised to teach wisdom, chap. 33.33. And
that he spoke not to the many, it is probable, for they have not those aures
perpurgatas, that he calls for in the next verse. (...) fere sunt, they are
heavy eared for most part, and of dull apprehension: Baeotum in patria,
crassoque sub aere nati. To the other three then of Jobs friends he applies
himself: whom because he had sharply reproved before, and that they may not
think that he held himself the only wise man amongst them, he thus bespeaketh
to get audience, and makes them Judges of his discourse. (...) Theog.
Men may be wise in some things, that have carried the matter foolishly enough
in other.

And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledg] It is an happiness to have such
hearers. I speak as to wise men, judge ye what I say, 1 Cor. 10.15. Jovianus
the Emperor was wont to wish, That he might govern wise men, and that wise men
might govern him. But as it was once said, That there was never less wisdom in
Greece then in the days of the seven wise men: So may we now well complain,
that there is a very great want of sound and saving knowledge in this great
abundance of helps thereunto: So that we may cry out with the Prophet Isaiah,
Whom shall we teach knowledge, and whom shall we make to understand the hearing?
Them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts; q.d. We have to
do with very babies, children in understanding, but not in malice.

Verse 3. For the ear tries words] And for that end we have that excellent
sense of hearing given us, that we may hear with judgment, and trying all
things, hold fast that which is good, 1 These. 5.21. taking heed what we hear,
Mark 4.24. as by the taste we may take heed what we let down; for else a man
may easily eat his own bane, drink his poison: So here, for the soul has her
senses also, Phil. 1.9. and these habitually exercised to discern good and
evil, Hebr. 5. ult. Which whilst carnal people want, they are carried away as
they are led, 1 Cor. 12.2. Plucked away with the error of the wicked, 2 Pet. 3
17, wherried about with every wind of Doctrine, Heb. 13.9. etc. See the Note on
chap. 12.1.

Verse 4. Let us choose to us judgment] Let us summon the sobriety of our senses
before our judgments; laying aside all prejudice: for, Omne judicium a se
aufert qui praejudicium affert; He can never judge aright, who comes to a Cause
forestalled or prepossessed.

Let us know amongst our selves what is good] Let us go knowingly to work,
according to apparent truth; and not use cunningly devised Arguments, as many (
Mataeologi rather then Theologi) do now adays in the greatest Controversies of
Religion: and hereunto let us all contribute our best help, for the finding out
of truth, and convincing of Job.

Verse 5. For Job has said, I am righteous] So he was with a two fold
righteousness; imputed, or the righteousness of Justification; and imparted,
or the righteousness of Sanctification. But Elihu understood him as if he had
said, I am sinless: This Job never said; only he cleared himself of foul
offenses wherewith his friends falsely charged him: and asserted his own
integrity, whereof he seemed to be more sollicitous, than of giving God the
glory of his justice: and therein he was to be blamed, as here he is to some
purpose.

And God has taken away my judgement] sc. By handling me like a wicked man,
and not showing me why: see chap. 27.2. where Job had used these very words,
but not in the sense that Elihu urges them against him.

Verse 6. Should I lie against my right?] Vt meam causam prodam, R. Levi.
so as to betray my cause, and yield my self guilty, when I know my self
innocent? This I will never do, said Job: no more would that peerless Lady
Elizabeth, when as a traitor she was laid up in the Tower, and pressed to
appeach her self. Better die, than lie.

My wound is incurable without transgression] These last words, without
transgression, Elihu spitefully thrusts in, says Beza. Others think they may
be gathered out of chap. 9.17. and 16.17. Without presumtuous sin, (which David
calls the great transgression, the wickedness with a witness) Job might truly
say, it may be: for all men are sinners, yet not all alike; though all have a
dyscrasie, yet every man has not a fever; and though none are without ill
humors, yet some have not a leprosy upon them.

Verse 7. What man is like Job?] This Elihu speaks by way of angry
admiration, Exclamatio admirativa. Pisc.
as if he would make Job a very Non-such, a match-less offender; and that he
much wondered with what face he could speak in that sort. What, such a man as
Job do thus? O shameful! what? upbraid and reproach Almighty God? who would
ever have expected such words from such a mouth? Is the man in his right mind,
wot you, that he thus makes himself a common laughing stock, and byword, and
yet makes nothing of any thing, but does with as great facility and readiness
swallow up men's scoffs and taunts, as if he were drinking cold water, and no
more is he troubled at them? Why, but is this Job? and is it possible that he
should have so far lost all fear of God, and shame of the world, that he should
set his mouth against heaven, as if he would spet in Gods face, and not care
though he drink up scorning and affronts like water, quasi maledictis aleretur
ut venenis capreae, as if he were much taken and tickled with them? True it is,
that Nemo pluris asti^^vit virtutem, as Seneca says, No man sets a better
price upon virtue, than he who will rather part with his good name, than part
with his honesty. But it is also as true, that to neglect altogether what
others think and say of us, Cic.
non solum arrogantis est, sed and dissoluti, is the part not of a proud only,
but of a forlorn person, says the Orator.

Verse 8. Which goes in company with the workers of iniquity] Strange if he
should: for the wicked is abomination to the righteous, Prove. 29. ult. Lord
gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men, says David,
Psalm. 26.9. Lord, send me not to hell among the wicked, (said a certain good
woman upon her deathbed) for thou know I never liked their company here on
earth. But how proves Elihu this Charge against Job, who was ever a terror to
graceless Belialists? Forsooth he gathers it from a certain speech of his, if
he could tell what, or when it was uttered.

Verse 9. For he has said, It profits a man not] Did Job ever say so, or
think so? Where? and when? He said indeed (and truly) that in this life it is
often seen, that bad men prosper, and good men suffer. But must it needs follow
therefore, that it is a course of no profit to walk with God? Knows not
Elihu, that there is nothing that may not be taken with either hand? and that
it is a spiritual unmannerliness to take it with the left? Indeed it is not
amiss to admonish good men, what absurdities may be gathered out of their
words: and it is fit that they should prevent it, as much as may be. Elihu also
was the more to be born with (and that made Job let him go on, likely, without
a reply) because he pleaded for God, and the glory of his justice, which Job
had somewhat wronged, as cannot be denied, whiles he gave too much way to his
grief and other passions, and now begins to be sensible of his out-bursts:
But truly, if he should have said as here he is taxed, (and yet David and
Jeremy said little less) he would have gone in company with those workers of
iniquity, Isai. 58.3. Mal. 3.14, 15. and have lifted at the very foundation of
all true Religion, Heb. 11.6. and thence it was, that Elihu was so hot. But men
must take heed of drawing odious consequences out of other men's speeches; and
of forcing them to go two miles, when they would go but one. Surely the
churning of milk brings forth butter, and the wringing of the nose brings
forth blood, etc. Prove. 30.33.

That he should delight himself with God] Or, When he runs with God.
Tremellius, (...) Ezekiel. 1.14
When he shall be willing to walk with God. as Genesis 5.22. The Tigurines render
the whole verse thus, Dixit enim, vir non faciet paria, si cum Deo cursu
contendat. Sure it is n^c volentis, n^c volantis, (as a Noble man gave it for
his Motto) It is not in him that wills, nor in him that runs; no though he
could run as fast as a bird can fly, but in God that shows mercy.

Verse 16. Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding] Heb. Ye men of
heart; Egregie cordati Viri. Cor est seeds sapicuti^.
Mentemque habere qu^is bonam
Et esse corculis datum est.
Having recited Jobs evil speeches, he truneth away from him as it were in
great displeasure, and directs his speech to others. See the like done by
Jacob, Genes. 49.4. We should abhor that which is evil; and show our
detestation thereof.

Far be it from God that he should do wickedness, etc.] scil. By punishing any
without a cause; and this he double-denyeth for better assurance. Cause enough
there may be found in the very best, as well by reason of their actual
abominations (their omissions, commissions, and failings in the manner) as of
their birth-blot, which ever abides with them while they are here, and is a
seed-plot of all sin. How then can God wrong any one? Surely it is inconsistent
with Gods 1. Nature, here: 2. Actions, v. 11. 3. Will, v. 12. And although he
might, to show his Sovereignty, punish men for his pleasure, Romans 9.20. yet far
be it from us to imagine that he will abuse his might and power to do any thing
unjust or unbeseeming his goodness.

Verse 11. For the work of a man shall he render unto him] This is both his
Covenant and his custom: so far is he from doing wrong to any, that every man
shall be sure to reap as he sowes, to drink as he brewes, to receive according
to that he has done in the flesh, whether good or evil, 2 Cor. 5.10. And
albeit this is not done forthwith, yet we may write upon it, and reckon that
nondum omnium dierum soles occiderunt; as sure as the night follows the day,
a day of account will come, and God will render unto each man reward or
punishment according to his works.

And cause every man to find according to his wayes] According to the course of
his life, and not according to this or that particular action. A Doeg may set
his foot as far within the Sanctuary as a David; and a David may in some
particular out-sin a fire brand of hell. But the ways of a man are before the
eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings, Prove. 5.21. He considers
the bent, frame, and tendency of the heart, and proceeds accordingly.

Verse 12. Yea surely God will not do wickedly] This must be laid down for a
certain truth, and is therefore so reiterated. Job had said as much to this
purpose as Elihu could do; but then he had seemingly dashed all again with his
inconsiderate complaints and murmurings. This Elihu could not bear, but again
and again celebrateth the rithteousnesse of God; and when he has said his
utmost, seems to say as Cicero once did of Crassus and Antonius the Roman
Orators, Cic. de Orat. l. 3
That if any man think he had said too much in commendation of them, he must
needs be such an one as either knew them not, or was not able to judge of their
worth. As for Job, whom he here confuteth, he seems to say of him, as Calvin
somewhere does of Luther, That as he excelled with great virtues, so he was not
without his great failings. Atque utinam recognoscendis suis vitiis plus operae
dedisset; and I would, says he, Calv. ep. Bulling
that he had spent less time in declaiming against others, and more in
recognizing his own faults.

Neither will the Almighty pervert judgment] For shall not the Judge of all the
earth do right? See the Note on chap. 7.3.

Verse 13. Who has given him a charge over all the earth?] scil. To govern it;
Is not he the Maker and Monarch of all men? Who is his Superior? and to whom
shall he give account? and who shall expostulate with him about injustice? Or,
for fear of whom should he warp or writh? The Emperor cannot do right, says
One, Theophil. Inst.
because he has none to overawe him, or question him. It is said to Trajan,
that he neither feared nor hated any man living. What then shall we think of
him, Mercer.
who is Moderator and Dominator supremus ac solus,

Or who has disposed the whole world?] The habitable world: and especially
that habitable part of Gods earth, as man is called, Prove. 8.31.

Verse 14. If he set his heart upon man] Viz. For evil, and not for good, and
have a purpose to unmake him again, which he can as easily do, as will it to be
done.

If he gather unto himself his Spirit and his breath] If he take away his life,
which what is it else, but a puff of wind, a vapor, etc. who can say he is
unjust? May not the Potter do with his pot as he pleases? We subsist merely by
his Manutension; and if he but pull back his hand only, we are gone
immediately. This is to be seen in those that swoon suddenly away. See Psalm.
104.29. and consider how little this is considered by the most. Elihu thought,
that Job was wanting herein: for he had heard him chap. 12. disputing
concerning the sovereign and absolute power of God, almost in the very same
words, which himself here uses, from ver. 13. to 31.

Verse 15. All flesh shall perish together] i. e. All men, called here All
flesh, as Mark 16.16. they are called every creature, a little world. If God
command it to be so, they shall all breath out together.

And man shall turn to his dust again] The body to the dust whence it was
taken, but the Spirit to God who gave it, Eccles. 12.

Verse 16. If now thou have understanding, hear this] Hear it, and know it for
thy good, as chap. 4.27. if at least thou have any wit for thy self, or care
of thine own well doing. This is a stinging Apostrophe to Job. Si vel ^ica est
in te bonae mentis; unless thou have buried thy brains, and lost thy ^enses,
listen as for life.

Verse 17. Shall even he that hates right govern?] Heb. Bind; sc. Malefactors,
whom Magistrates use to hamper? Others take it of binding up the wounded after
the manner of Surgeons. An qui odit judicium, Chirurgos imitaretur? so the
Tigurines translate: Would he who hates right, do as Surgeons use to do?
Would God, if he were unrighteous, bind up the broken hearted, or receive into
favor (as he does) a sinner that repents, doing him good again, as if there
never had been a breach betwixt them? It has been noted, That a King has his
name in the Greek tongue from healing; and that Isai. 3.7. a Governor is called
a Healer, or Binder up; the same word there as here in the Text. (...) Medela.
But how unfit for such an Office must he needs be, who not only does not
right, but hates it, as did Nero, Caligula, Commodus, etc?

And will thou condemn him that is most just?] Or, That is strong and just;
illumne impietatis sugillabis? None in his right wits would ever do so: for
what else were this, Tigur.
but to exalt a man's self above the divine Majesty? And yet what do they less
then this, who grudge at Gods proceedings, and are ready to think that if they
had the ordering of things in their hands, they could dispose of them a fair
deal better? How absurd and unseemely this is in any one, is aptly set forth in
the next verse, Is it fit, etc?

Verse 18. Is it fit to say to a King, Thou art wicked?] Heb. Belial; that is,
Thou yoaklesse, Qui dicit regi Apostata, Vulg.
lawless, masterlesse Monster. Kings are not wont to be so accoasted and
aviled, nor is it lawful, Exodus 22.28. It is blasphemy in the second Table, to
speak evil of dignities, Jude 8. It was some disadvantage to Saint Paul, that
(although provoked and unjustly smitten) he called the High Priest whited wall,
Act. 23.3 he was glad to excuse it by his ignorance. And Luther cried our Henry
8 mercy, for his uncivil language to him, such as was that, Audi, Domine Rex,
edocebo ie, in a jeer. Dan. Hist.
H^nry 6. indeed was coursely handled in a tumult, and wounded, but then he was
at an under; and being restored he freely pardoned the Offender, saying, Alas
poor soul, he struck me more to win favor with others, then of any ill will he
bare me: But this was a rare example of patience in a King. Alexander the Great
dealt more harshly with his friends Clitus and Callisthenes, for their
plain-dealing. Se^.
Tiberius put to death a Poet for uttering some free words against him, though
under the person of Agamemnon, quem in iragoedia probris lacessisset.
Savanarola suffered deeply for telling the Pope his own. And Bajazet the second
took great revenge upon his Janissaries, Turk hist. fol. 444.
who, for his casting Achmetes Bassa into prison, they in an uproar insolently
cried out, that they would by and by teach him as a drunkard, a beast, and a
Rascal, to use his great Place and Calling with more sobriety and discretion.
Plut.
Kings must be spoken to with soft and silken words, as she said, (...). If
Elias, or Elisha, or Isaiah, or the Baptist do otherwise that is not a copy for
every man to write after. Is it safe to take a Lion by the beard, or a Bear by
the tooth? Naboth suffered, though falsely accused to curse the King: and Shimei
had at length his payment for reviling David. If Ezekiel called the King of
Judah, Thou wicked and profane Prince, chap. 21.25. that was by an
extraordinary spirit, and by a special command of God.

And to Princes* ye are ungodly?] Ingenuis. These, as they must not be
flattered, so neither may they be unmannerly advertized of their duty or
danger. It is probable, that Joseph used some kind of preface to Pharaohs chief
Baker in reading him that hard destiny, Gen 40.19. such happily as was that of
Daniel to Nebuchadnezzar; chap 4.19. My Lord, the dream be to them that hate
thee, etc. Or ad Philo brings him in with a V^inam tale somnium non videsses, I
would I had no such dream to interpret unto you. But for the matter he gives,
him a sound, though a sharp interpretation.

Verse 19 How much less to him that accepts not the person of Princes?] How
much more both dangerous and undecent must it needs be, wrongfully to accuse
God of injustice and partiality, which is far below him: since he neither does,
nor needs prefer great ones before meaner men in judgment? See on chap.
13.7. and 52.21.

N^^ regards the rich more then the poor] The word rendered rich, opulent, or
potent, (...)
comes either from a root that signifies to save; because it is in the power
of such to save others from hurt and damage: or else from another root, that
signifies to cry aloud; because such men use to speak their minds more freely
and boldly, as having that which can bear them out. (...)
But God acknowledges them not as such: only of them to whom much is given,
much shall be required.

For they are all the work of his hands] Both for their persons, for they are
all equally his creatures; and for their conditions, which God also has cut
them out, and apportioned. Thus he is said to have made Moses and Aaron, that
is, to have advanced them, 1 Samuel 12.6. and Christ is said to have made the
twelve, when he ordained them to the Apostleship, Mar. 3.14.

Verse 20. In a moment shall they die] Be they mean or mighty, they are, when
God pleases, suddenly swept away by the hand of death: as Chesse-men are into
the bag, without distinction of Kings, Dukes, Bishops, or Common people.

And the people shall be troubled at midnight] as were the Egyptians, when
their firstborn were slain in their dead sleep, Exodus 12.29. not without much
terror and tumult: and as were the Army of Sennacherib, 2 King. 19.35. and
Belshazzar with his Babylon, Dan. 5.30, 31. The people shall be troubled, they
shall be shaken as leaves in a great wind, or be carried away as by a mighty
torent; when they were most secure, and dreamt of no such danger. Neither in
all these alterations and various occurrences is God unrighteous, since he is
debtour to none, neither does he any thing without reason and right.

And pass away] Praeteribunt, id est peribunt: they shall pass into the
grave, as Eccles. 1.4. One generation passes, and another comes: or they
shall perish, as when it is said, Heaven and earth shall pass away. The Vulgar
has it, Pertransibunt. It is not transibunt, they shall pass, says Gregory;
but pertransibunt, they shall pass through, because the wicked are always
passing on to perdition, throughout all their lives.

And the mighty shall be taken away without hand] That is, without seeing the
hand that smites them; which is, says One, a divine force, invisibly cutting
asunder the thread of their lives in a moment, Psalm. 76.12. The Lord cutteth off
the spirit of Princes. The Hebrew imports, that he slips them off, as one
should slip of a flower betwixt his finger; or as one should slip of a bunch of
grapes, etc. The Original here is, They shall take away the mighty, that is,
the Angels shall (as Luke 12.20.) hurry them out of the world without hand,
that is without man's help, without humane violence.

Verse 21. For his eyes are upon the ways of man] Gods Providence (like a
well-drawn picture that eyeth each one in the room) observes all things: he
sees cause enough thus to proceed in judgment against a person or people,
though we see it not. And although one man knows not another; nor does any
man well know himself; yet God, following, as it were, all men hard at the
heels; does with his eyes narrowly observe and mark what way every one walks
in, he sees all his goings: Let not men therefore please themselves in their
sinful practices, as if God saw them not, because for a time they escape
unpunished; Saculi laetitia est impunita nequitia; but sin and punishment are
tied together with chains of Adamant, and cannot long be asunder.

Verse 22. There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, etc.] Sinners would fain
shroud and secret themselves from Gods all-seeing eye: for which end they
search all corners, with Adam, and hope that their evil pranks and practices
shall never come to light: but that cannot be, for not only darkness and the
shadow of death, but Hell also is naked before him, and destruction has no
covering, Job 26.6. See the Note there. See also Psalm. 139.12. and Amos 9.2, 3.
Heb. 4.13. with the Notes.

Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves] Either from Gods all-seeing
eye, or punishing hand; Adam is pulled out of the thicket: Manasseth from among
the thorns: Zedekiah, and his family, from between the two walls: many Jews out
of the privies and other lurking-holes where they lay hid, at the last
destruction of Jerusalem.

Verse 23. For he will not lay upon man more then right] Plus quam par est. Nam
non s^ virum ponc^ tra.
He cannot over-do likely: no, though he should inflict upon him all the
torments here, and tortures in hell, since death, in the utmost e^tent of it, is
the just hire of the least sin, Romans, 6.23. See Ezr. 9.13. with the Note.

That he should enter into judgment with God] Commence a suit against him, or
challenge him into the schools to argue it out with him, as thou Job have
offered to do: but unadvisedly; since God has justice on his side; as the very
Heathens also saw, when they set Themis their goddess of Justice (...) next of
all to Jupiter, their chief god.

Verse 24. He shall break in pieces mighty men, etc.] Infinite conterit
validos, so Tremellius renders it. He infinitely mawleth the mighty; and
breaks them in pieces like a potters vessel, Psalm. 2.9.

Without number] Or, Without inquisition: as knowing all things aforehand, and
not needing any evidences or examination of witnesses: Or, without end, because
their ruin is endless. Ruina majorum sit cantela minorum.

And set others in their stead] As is to be seen in the rise, reign, and ruin
of the four mighty Monarchies, and others not a few, that had their times, and
their turns: as the Kingdom of the ten Tribes, which in a few years fell into
nine several Families: and few of those Kings died a natural death: No more did
the Emperors of Rome, till Constantine. See Dan. 2.21. Psalm. 113.7, 8.

Verse 25. Therefore he knows their works] It appears by their punishment,
that God took notice of their wicked works; though they thought otherwise: yea,
when they know not, or are not aware of it, he overthrows them therefore.
This he does in the night, i. e. suddenly and unexpectedly. Others render it,
As Soon as he has changed the night, they are crushed; that is, as soon as he
has brought forth the light which reveals all things, Ephesians. 5.13. and
lays them open to public view, who before were taken for better men, they
are destroyed, as public Pests.

Verse 26. He strikes them as wicked men, etc.] Complodit eos, says Junius,
scilicet ut inflatas vesical in sun ipsorum sede, he strikes upon them, as
blown bladders in their own seat. This is an elegant similitude, setting forth
the sudden overthrow of graceless great Ones, as with a kind of noise, and not
without public notice; for it follows,

In the open sight of others] Heb. In the place of beholders, in proscenio, as
upon a Stage, or Scaffold, Discant justitiam moniti, and non temnere ^imen:
others may hear and fear, and do no more so. God is pleased for this purpose to
hang up some notorious offenders as it were in gibbets; as Pharaoh,
Sennacherib, Antiochus, Herod, Julian, etc. See those Writs of Execution, 1
Cor. 10.5, 6, 7, etc. and be wise by others woes: enjoy their follies, and
gather, with the Be, sweet honey out of those bitter weeds. Poena ad pancos,
metus ad omnes.

Verse 27. Because they have turned back from him] To pursue after lying
vanities, broken cisterns; which whosoever do, as they fall into two foul sins
at once (such as heaven and earth have cause to be astonished at, and afraid
of) Jeremiah 2.12, 13. so they are miserable by their own Election, Jonah 2.
verse. 8.

And would not consider any of his wayes] Wisely consider them, as David did
Psalm. 119.168. All Gods laws were in his sight: and all his ways in Gods
sight. This was the general cause of their destruction. The special follows.

Verse 28. So that they cause the cry of the poor, etc. These they compel, by
their oppressions, to wash the earth with their tears, and to importune heaven
with their complaints, Senault.
as One phraseth it. The wicked do as it were, bring up to God the cries of the
poor oppressed, and so pull upon themselves inevitable destruction. for he is
the poor man's Patron, and hears the cry of the afflicted. The grand Signior
would have the world take notice, that such as lament unto him, shall be sure
to have redress and succor from him. Grand Sign. Serag. 147.
Wherefore also he calls himself Awl^m Penaw^^, The worlds Refuge, A title
far more fit for the God of heaven, than for any earthly Monarch, (...). Manl.
loc. (...)
were he far more gracious than the great Turk, from whose courtesy (freely
offered him) Luther blessed himself with a Deus me tutatur a tali benefice
Domino; God defend me from such a gracious Lord.

Verse 29. When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble] Ipse
tranquillabit, and quis inquietabit? This is like that of the Apostle, says
Brentius, Romans 8. If God be for us, who can be against us? Who shall lay any
thing to the charge of Gods Elect, etc? It is he alone who gives peace, both
of country and of conscience; Peace, peace. Isai. 26.3. Pacem omnimodam;
external, internal, eternal; and then, who can disturb or unsettle? Surely as
Isaac once said to Esau, concerning Jacob, He is blessed, and he shall be
blessed: so may it be said of such as have made their peace with God; Peace
shall be upon them and Mercy, contra gentes, whosoever says nay to it; yea,
though it be the Devil himself, that (...) as he is often called, the Troublesome
one: who, ever since he was cast out of heaven, keeps ado on earth, and seeks
to disquiet all such as by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory,
and honor, and immortality, Romans 2.7.

And when he hides his face, who then can behold him?] Him? Whom? God: who
dare look upon him, or toward him for help, when he is thoroughly displeased and
looks irefully? Or, the party frowned on by God: who will smile upon him, or
show him any favor and furtherance? Here Aben-Ezra gives a good Note, Aversio
vultus Dei, etc. The turning away of Gods pleased countenance is the cause of
all Wars and other disasters. The Physiologer in Epiphanius tells of the Bird
Charadius, that being brought into the room where a man lies sick, if he look
with a steady and fixed eye upon the sick man, he recovereth: but if he turn
away from him, and look another way, the disease is to death. Apply this to
God, and it fitteth.

Whether it be done against a Nation, or against a man only] All Is a case (as
they say) to God; he stands not upon multitudes, as men use to do in case of
Mutinies or the like, to punish the tenth man or so, in terrorem, for a terror
to the rest. This is not Gods way of punishing: but as a thousand years are to
him but as a day, and one day as a thousand years: so when he proceeds to
execution of Justice, whether it be done against a Nation, etc. All Nations to
him are but as a drop of a bucket, or dust of a balance, Isai. 40. And hence he
buried a world full of people in one universal grave of waters. And the wicked
(be they never so many) shall be turned into hell: With whole nations tht
forget God, Psalm. 9.17. God seems to say, Fiat justitia, ruat orbis.

Verse 30. That the hypocrite reign not] That he reign no longer; Almighty God
takes order, by putting these mighties from their seats, and exalting them of
low degree, Luke 1.52. And why? 1. Lest the hypocrite, or the impure and
impious man reign: Such as was Jehu, Herod, Julian, our Richard 3. Pope Sixtus
Quintus, of whom One says, Spec. Europ.
that he was the most crouching humble Cardinal that ever was lodged in an
oven, and the most stout proud Pope, that ever wore Crown: What pride equal to
his, making Kings kiss his Pantof^es? What humility (pretended) greater than
his, shrieving himself daily on his knees to an ordinary Priest? He calls
himself the servant of Gods servants: and yet stamps in his Coin, That Nation
and Country that will not serve thee, shall be rooted out: he also suffers
his Parasites to style him, Our Lord God the Pope. Is not this a notorious
hypocrite? and when such a one reigns and takes upon him to be Lord of all
both in spirituals and temporals, may not we conclude that God hides his face
(as in the former verse) from his people? May we not cry out as Basil once did,
Epist. 17.
Number Ecclesias suas dereliquit Dominus? has the Lord utterly forsaken his
Churches? It is, doubtless, a very great judgment upon a people, when an
hypocrite or a profane person is set over them, who pretends the public good
to his own designs and self-interests, and by his crafty inventions undoes his
subjects, robbing them of their lawful liberties, and enslaving them. Some read
the words thus, Vulg. Spe^. Ab. Ezra.
He causes that the hypocrite reigns for the sins of the people. It is
threatened as an heavy curse, Levit. 26.17. If you still trespass against me,
I will set Princes over you that shall hate you; mischievous, odious Princes,
odious to God, malignant to the people: Such as was Phocas that bloody Tyrant,
who, when he had slain his Master Mauricius, and reigned in his stead, there
was an honest poor man, says Cedrenus, who was earnest with God to know a
reason, why such a thing was suffered? to whom it was answered, That a worse
man could not be found: and that the sins of Christians required it. We read of
Attilus King of Swethland, that he made a Dog King of the Danes, in revenge of
a great many injuries received by them. Sr. Rich. Berkley's Sum. Pon. p. 387.
Gunno likewise King of the Danes made a Dog King of Norway; and appointed
Counselors to do all things under his Title and Name: That which these men
did spitefully, God sometimes does righteously; setting up tyrants for a
punishment to those that were unthankful for better government: and would not
have him to reign over them.

Lest the people be ensnared] Heb. For the snares of the people; that is, for
the injuries and vexations wherewith that hypocrite oppressed the people; to
put an end to those, by taking away the Tyrant, who for his cruel craft, and
crafty cruelty, is here fitly compared to an hunter or fowler laying snares.
Sunt autem leges iniquae and exactiones injustae principum hypocritarum, laquci
and decipulae quibus populum sibi subjectum venantur and capiunt, says
Brentius here: i.e. Bad Laws and unjust exactions of hypocritical Princes, are
the snares and gins wherewith they hunt after, and catch their subjects.

Verse 31. Surely it is me^t to be said unto God, I have born chastisement] To
convince a man of a fault, and not to advise him how to do better, is to snuff
a Lamp and not pour more Oil into it. Elihu therefore now sets himself to
counsel Job, whom he conceives he had sufficiently convinced of injury done to
God. Surely it is meet, etc. Par est; this is supplied by the Translatours to
make sense; for the Original is very concise and dark, and therefore diversely
interpreted; as is also all this latter part of the Chapter. Some render it
thus, But to God who says, I pardon, I will not destroy, it should be said,
That which I see not, teach thou me; etc. Some thus, Therefore we ought thus to
speak unto God, I suffer patiently, I will not break asunder; viz. These bonds
wherewith thou have fast bound me. Others thus; Has Job said to God, I have
born, etc. q.d. Nothing less, as ye all are witnesses. Others again thus, Has
he; (that is, the Tyrant dethroned, as in the verse aforegoing) said to God, I
have been, etc, Has he confessed his wickedness, and promised amendment? No
such matter surely, therefore is he justly punished. This is a very good sense,
says Mercer. But to stick to our last and best Translation, Surely it is meet,
etc. for is it fit that God should cast down the bucklers first, and not have
the better of us? Should we not rather disarm his just indignation by an humble
yeeldance?

I have born chastisement] Heb. I have born and will bear, being active in
suffering, and taking up my cross.

I will not offend any more] Heb. I will not corrupt, to wit, my ways, and so
undo my self.

Verse 32 That which I see not teach thou me] For I am yet in the dark, and
know not the right cause wherefore thou afflictest me. Herein men are very apt
to mistake themselves, and when God calls one way, to run another, as young
Samuel did, 1 Samuel 2. The devil also deals by the afflicted as the Jews did
by Christ, blindfolds them, and then bids them prophecy who smote them, and for
what? Hence in afflictions we many times grope, as blind men, guessing at this
cause, and at that, but seldom fasten on the right. Here then God must be
sought unto for direction, and besought, that he would graciously point us to
the sin he strikes at. This Job had done once and again, chap. 10.2. and 13.23.
But Elihu would have him to do it yet better.

If I have done iniquity, I will do no more] Thus men must both vow and perform
to the Lord their God, Psalm. 76.11. and not promise amendment as children do
when taken up to be whipped; or as men in danger at sea, or on their sick beds,
use to do largely; But then sciaputo il morbo, fraudato il Santo, as the
Italian Proverb has it, When the Disease is removed, the Saint is defrauded.
Pharaoh promised fair whiles upon the Rack; but got off once, he hardened his
heart, and would do nothing. So those slippery Votaries, Jer. 34.11.

Verse 33 Should it be according to thy mind] Heb. From with thee: q.d. Must
things be as thou will? And is it fit for thee to prescribe to the Almighty?
(See Hos. 8.4.) to set the Sun by thy Dial?

He will recompense it, whether thou refuse, etc.] He will have his pennyworths
of thee, whether thou be pleased or displeased.

And not I] Though I foretell thee this, yet it is God that will effect it:
therefore think not the worse of me, no more then a people should of a Herald
or the Trumpet as the cause of their war.

Therefore speak what thou knowest] Viz. In thine one behalf, but speak the
word of truth and soberness. He was no fool who said, It has often repented
me to have spoken, but seldom to have held my peace. There are many other
readings, and expositions of the words. Let every man (for me) take his choice,
and abound in his own sense, so it dissent not from the Analogy of faith.

Verse 34. Let men of understanding tell me] Or, Say with me; say as I say;
viz. That Job has spoken without knowledge, as verse. 35. and that I have spoken
the thing that is right in vindicating the divine Justice, from thy causeless
criminations.

And let a wise man hearken unto me] I presume there is not one wise man alive
but will be of my mind: and for fools, the men of this world, ever besides
themselves in point of salvation, I regard not their censures, -- Equitem mihi
plandere curo.

Verse 35. Job has spoken without knowledge] Inscienter and inscite, He has
out-lashed and overshot himself in some words against God; yea, amidst his
complaints, he has let slip not a few lavish and loose speeches, which thing
also being reproved by God, he does ingenuously acknowledge, chap. 40. and 42.

And his words were without wisdome] Heb. Not in wisdom; and this he here
hears of on both ears, being barely told of it again and again, and not
without some bitterness in the close of this Chapter. Some warmth there must be
in a reproof (the Physic will work the better) but scalding hot it must not be.

Verse 36. My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end] Or, Unto victory,
Vsque ad victoriam. Trem.
ill he be vanquished and set down. It is conceived, that Job by clapping his
hands, as verse 37. or by the set of his countenance, or some other way had
discovered his dislike of, and discontent at that which Elihu had spoken: He
therefore begs of God to continue afflicting him, till he be in a better mind.
Crux sancta est, and salubris.
This he does by a special instinct for Jobs good, and not out of any desire
for revenge. So Farellus pronounced a curse upon young Calvin's studies, At ego
tibi studia tua praetexenti denuncio Omnipotentis Dei nomine, etc Calv. vit.
in case he should refuse to join with him in the Lords work at Geneva, where a
Church had been newly planted: this so thunderstruck him, that be durst not
stir there hence to his dying day. Some read it, My Father, let Job be tried.
It is not to be doubted, but those Ancients also called God by this sweet name
of Father. See John 8.41. Beza makes Elihu thus bespeaking Job, for honors
sake, O my Father. Job shall be yet still tried. The Tigurines read, Haec autem
in medium affero. These things I produce, that Jobs things may be most exactly
discussed, and wicked men's mouths stopped.

Because of his answers for wicked men] Who will take liberty by him to excuse
their iniquity, and speak dishonourably of God, as he has done.

Verse 17. For he adds rebellion unto his sin] Or, He will add, viz. unless
he be exercised and subdued by more and longer load of afflictions; there will
else be no hoe with him, no ground will hold him. The cross is of singular use
to tame that rebel Flesh: and is therefore prayed for by Jeremy for himself,
chap. 10.24. and here by Elihu for Job, who had before advisedly chosen
affliction rather then sin, and reckoned it as a mercy to be visited every
morning, and tried every moment, chap. 7.18.

He clappeth his hands amongst us] By way of irrision, and as insulting over
us. This it may seem Job had done in a disdainful way against all that had
been spoken, which makes Elihu thus fiercely to charge him.

And multiplyeth his words against God] By a strange pertinacy. He delivers
him therefore unto God to be further afflicted; as St. Paul did Hymenaus and
Alexander unto Satan to be inwardly buffetted, and bodily tormented (as Act.
13.11. and 19.16) Vt castigati discerent; that they might learn not to
blaspheme, 1 Timothy 1.20.

CHAP. XXXV. Verse 1. Elihu spoke moreover, and said.]
HIs speech was for God, as before; and therefore he spoke moreover: For, as
Austin faith of the Feast of Pentecost, Gaudet produci haec solennitas; so we
may say of a Discourse of this nature, Gaudet produci haec serm^cina^io; the
longer it is, the better; since of God and his righteous dealing, Non satis
unquam dici potest, as Lavater here has it; never can enough be spoken. For
although we all yield that God is just, yet if any cross befall us, we are apt
to question it, and to think our selves hardly dealt with.

Verse 2. Think thou this to be right?] Heb. Reckonest thou this to be
right? q.d. I appeal to thine own conscience. This is a sign of great
confidence in the Appealer, yet may it be done by men of corrupt minds,
destitute of the truth: Witness that bold Anabaptist, Scult. Annal.
that in a solemn Dispuation at Tigure, appealed to Zuinglius, as if convinced
in his own conscience, he had inwardly favored Anabaptism. And those impudent
Papists, Gagge of the New Gospel. Preface.
that report themselves to our consciences, to tell them, Whether our
condemnation be not so expressly set down in our own Bibles, and so clear to all
the world, that nothing more needs thereto, then that they know to read, and to
have their eyes in their heads at the opening of our Bible: To tell them
more-over, Idem ibid.
whether England has not brought forth within these few years past, to the
number of twenty several sorts of Bibles, far different one from another.

That thou said, My righteousness is more then Gods] Heb. My righteousness
is before Gods. Diodate renders it, My Righteousness is from God; that is, I
am sure God will justify me, though men condemn me. But it is better to render
it, Prae Deo, more then Gods (see a like expression, Heb. 12.24.) understanding
it of the justice of his Cause, and not of his Person. But taking it so too,
when and where did Job ever say that his righteousness was more then Gods? No
where surely in so many words, for then doubtless Satan, and not Job, would
have carried away the victory in this conflict. Neither surely could this be
rightly gathered out of Jobs words, but detorted and misconstrued. Elihu
therefore reproved him with two great austerity, neither can any thing be
pleaded for him but this, that he pleaded for God; of whose glory he was so
very tender, that he could not brook or bear with any syllable of a word that
seemed to detract from it.

Verse 3. For thou said, What advantage will it be unto thee?] Here he
endeavors to prove the charge, grounding upon some words of Jobs, as chap.
9.22. and 10.15. which seem to hold out thus much, that no good was to be
gotten by leaving evil ways, since good men and bad suffer and perish together.
But we must know, that Job herein reasoned not of those things that fall out
after death, but only of the prosperous or unhappy estate of this life present;
denying, and that rightly, that we are hereby to judge of Gods love or hatred,
or of any man's honest or dishonest conversation; Neither yet did he stand in
defense of his own righteousness against God, but only appealed to God as a
most wise and just Judge, against the false accusations of his fo-friends, who
by pouring oil into the fire, as it were, very much vexed and disquieted him
all along.

Or what profit shall I have if I be cleansed from my sin?] Or, What profit
shall I have by it more then by my sin? This, if Elihu could have proved that
Job had said, he might very well have justified what he had wished to him, and
affirmed of him in the two last verses of the precedent Chapter.

Verse 4. I will answer thee and thy companions with thee] Thy three friends,
(who have not so well quit themselves in this Controversy, as having answered
little or nothing to this unsavory saying of thine) and to the rest of the
bystanders, which approve of thine opinion, as people are apt to favor the
weaker side (as it is reputed) and to encourage them. Thus it befell Luther,
when he began first to reform.

Verse 5. Look unto the heavens and see] Yea, look into them, if thou could,
as did Steven the Proto-Martyr, Act. 7.56. and as our Savior Christ, as man,
could do (say some) with his bodily eyes; and as a believer by the eye of his
faith, through the Perspective glass of the Promises, may do doubtless. The
further we can look unto heaven (or into it) the better shall we conceive of
that infinite distance that is betwixt God in heaven, and men on earth. God is
far above the highest heavens, therefore higher then any mortal can attain to
him, much less contribute any thing unto him by his righteousness; or assault
him by his wickedness. Herodotus writes, That the Thracians once were so mad
against their god Jupiter, for raining down upon them when ready to join
battle with the enemy, that they threw up their darts against heaven, which
shortly returned upon their own heads. And of Caligula the Emperor it is
storied that he thundered and lightened with certain Engines he had; and if at
any time a thunderbolt fell from heaven, ipse contra jaci^bat lapidem, Dioin
vit. Calig
he on the other side threw up a stone, and used that Hemistich in Homer, (...)
Either do thou kill me, or I Will kill the^, if I can. And what less then this
upon the matter do those monsters and miscreants amongst us, who set their
mouths against heaven, when things go cross with them especially; and their
tongues walk through the earth, Psalm. 73.9? As Hacket did, who lifting up his
eyes to heaven* and grinning against God, blasphemed him, and threatened him,
even when he had the rope about his neck, Anno 1591. Now, as in the water face
answers to face, Cambd. Eliz. fol 403.
so does the face of a man to a man. And as there were many Marii in one
Caesar, so there are many Caligula's and Hackets in the best of us all, if God
restrain us not from such horrid outrages. But Elihu would have us here to
know; that God is far above our reach, neither can we throw this high and lofty
one out of his throne, utcunque fremamus and ferociamus: for how should any
thing that we silly. Creatures can do, reach to God; when as we cannot reach
up to the visible heavens?

And behold the clouds which are higher then thou] Eminent prae te. The clouds
are Gods Chariot whereon he rides, and wherein he manifests much of his
Majesty. These Elihu would have Job to contemplate in their height, even
superiores nub^s, as Tremellius renders it, the upper clouds; or, as others,
the Starry Heaven, Heb. The thin of heavens. So Bildad before had called upon
him to behold the Moon and the Stars, chap. 25.5. And surely the very sight of
heaven over us (to the which all that we are or can, can bring no help or hurt
at all) should admonish us of our meanness, and make us think most modestly of
God, whom we are so infinitely below; and not dare either to complain of him,
or to boast us before him; etc. For this cause it is that Elihu so presses Job
here with this heap of words, that he may henceforth know and keep his
distance; and not so presumptuously call God (as it were) to reckoning,
touching expenses and receipts.

Verse 6. If thou sinnest, what do thou against him?] What more then show thy
teeth? or shoot at a rock, where the Arrow rebounds upon thee? In the sack of
Constantinople, the Image of the Crucifix was taken down by the Turks, and a
Turks Cap put upon the head thereof, and so set up, and shot at with their
arrows; Turk hist. 347
and afterward in great derision, carried about in the Camp, as it were in
Procession, with Drums playing before it, railing and spitting at it, and
calling it the God of the Christians; But what was all this to Christ? He that
sits in the heavens ( extra jactum) laughed at them, the Lord had them in
derision, Psalm. 2.4. Etsi navites peccas.
Do wicked sinners, when they work hardest against God (as the word here
signifies) and take greatest pains to go to hell; do they, I say, provoke the
Lord to anger? Do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own
faces? Jer. 7.19 And may we not well say to such, as Ulysses his companions
said to him, when he would needs provoke Polydamas. (...). Hom. Odys.
God can easily get him a name in the utter overthrow of a rabble of rebels
conspiring against him, as at the Flood, tower of Babel, Sodom, Egypt, Moab,
etc. who were trodden down under him, as straw is trodden down for the dunghill,
Isai. 25.10. And in the next verse, The Lord shall spread forth his hands in the
midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreads forth his hands to swim, (that is,
with greatest facility; for violent strokes rather sink then support a swimmer)
and he shall bring down their pride, together with the spoils of their hands:
And the fortress of the high fort of their walls shall he bring down, lay low,
and bring to the ground, even to the dust, Isai. 25.11, 12.

Verse 7. If thou be righteous, what give thou him?] Nothing, since he is
self-sufficient, and independent. He needs us not, neither does our
righteousness reach him, Psalm. 16.2. The Pharisees dreamt of an over-doing the
Law, and making God beholding to them. The Papists also, those modern
Pharisees, talk of works of super-erogation, and of merit of congruity and
merit of condignity. But these are mere fictions, Chimaera's, absurd Doctrines,
such as Elihu never heard of. He that does righteousness is righteous, 1 John
3.7. but he adds nothing thereby to God, let him do his utmost. Indeed whosoever
offers praise, glorifieth God, Psalm. 50.23. so he is pleased to account it,
and call it: but his glory is as himself is, eternal, infinite, immense. The
Sun would shine in its own brightness, though all the world were blind, and
should wilfully wink: so here. God accepts not our persents, but to return
them us back with interest, as the rain ascends in thin vapors, but comes
down again in thick showers.

Or what receives he of thine hand?] If any thing, it is of his own, as David
thankfully acknowledges, 1 Chronicles. 29.14. and besides that, our sweetest
Incense smells strong of the hand that offers it.

Verse 8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art] Wicked men are many ways
mischievous to others; and have much to answer for their other men's sins. How
many are undone by their murders, adulteries, robberies, false testimonies,
blasphemies and other rotten speeches, to the corrupting of good manners, etc?
What hurt is done daily by the Devils factours, to men's souls, bodies, names,
estates? Besides that they betray the land wherein they live into the hands of
divine Justice, whiles they do wickedly with both hands earnestly, Mic. 7.3.
That I speak not of the manifold miseries, they pull upon themselves.

And thy righteousness may profit the son of man] Thy self and others: for the
Just lives by his own faith, he makes a living of it, and a good one too. And
as for his Charity, it is the mother of all manner of good works, whereof
others have the benefit. Papists, and some as silly, have shrunk up charity to
an hands breadth, to giving of Alms: But besides that, a good man draws out,
not only his sheaf, but his soul to the hungry. 1 Thessalonians. 5.14.
He also warns the unruly, comfort the feeble minded, supporteth the weak,
and tradeth all his talents for the good of others: He is a common blessing to
all that art about him. As Plutark said of the Neighbor-villages of Rome, in
Numa's time, That sucking in the air of that City, they breathed (...),
Righteousness; so may it be said of the City of God, and her Citizens.

Verse 9 By reason of the multitude (or magnitude) of oppressions, etc.] Or, Of
the oppressed, whom they (that is, whom the Oppressors, not worthy to be
named, as neither is that rich glutton, Luke 16.) make to cry. Job had said,
chap. 24.12. Men groan out of the City, and the soul of the wounded cries out;
yet God lays no^ folly to them; He punishes not the wrong-dealers according
to their deserts as Elihu interprets Job; and here refuteth him, as one that
accused God of injustice, because he hears not the cries of the oppressed.
But this is merely their own fault, faith Elihu; because they cry not to God
with truth and devotion: They ask and miss, because they ask amiss. For God
never fails to be with his afflicted, Psalm. 91. to preserve the simple, as
David found by experience, Psalm. 116. to hear those that call upon him in
truth, Psalm. 145. etc. he requires nothing of them but lawful petitions, and
honest hearts, and then they are sure to have out their prayers, either in
money, or moneys worth; either the same thing they ask, or a better.

They cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty] Magnatum. Such as was Pompey,
of whom the Romans cried out, Nostra miseria (...) ^o Magnus. We rue by thy
greatness, and are ruined. The greater any man is, unless gracious also, the
more he thinks he may oppress the meaner sort. They eat up my people, Videri
possu^^ magnates non^ alio loco habe^ tenuas quam minutos piscic^ los, quos
confe^tim and pleno o^ pro deliciis es^ tent. Merl.
as they eat bread, Psalm. 14. as so many Canibals; and as the bigger fishes
devour the lesser: they lay load upon them without mercy or measure, they beat
them with a strong arm, and make them cry aloud, filling the air with their
complaints, as nature teaches even bruit beasts to do when they are hurt. It
was not patience but pertinacy, an obstinate stiffeness of mind, that made some
Heathens, as Mithridates, Marius, Epicurus, etc. forbear crying, when
grievously tormented.

Verse 10. But none says, Where is God my maker?] Heb. My makers: to note the
Trinity, say some: others think, that he speaks of God in the plural number
only for honors sake. They call not upon God as their Creator, they praise him
not as their Preserver and Benefactor, says Elihu in this and the next verse:
but express a great deal of pride and vanity, verse 12, 13. and thence it is,
that their prayers are unanswered, and themselves unrelieved. The oppressed
should not only make moan and fill the air* vagis clamoribus, with brutish
outcries (the fruit of the flesh for ease, rather than of the spirit for
grace) but beg help of God by faithful prayer, Qui nos fecit, idem ille est qu^
nos fovet, co^^servat ae sustentat, etc. Brent. Englands Elizabeth.
and say, Where is God my maker? as Elisha once said, Where is the Lord God of
Eliah? Did he not make me, and will he not maintain me? built he not the
earthly house of this tottering Tabernacle, and is not he bound to repairs?
will he cast off the care of his own handywork? Is he not my Master, as well as
my Maker? and shall other Lords besides him have Dominion over me, and do with
me at their pleasure? Lord, look upon the wounds of thy hands (said Q Eliz.
whiles she was a Prisoner at Woodstock and had like to have been burnt in her
bed, one night) and despise not the work of thine hands. Thou have written me
down in thy book of Preservation with thine own hand: Oh read thine own
handwriting, and save me, etc.

Who gives songs in the night] As the oppressed pray not, and therefore are
not eased, (they are deservedly miserable, that might, but will not make
themselves happy by asking) so they praise not God for former deliverances by
day and night conferred upon them. Thou have compassed me about, says David
with songs of deliverance, Psalm. 32.7. that is, Thou have given me plentiful
matter of praising thy name. So here, Qui dat Psalmorum argumentum de n^cte as
Tremellius translateth it: who gives cause to praise him with Psalms by night,
as David did Psalm. 119.62. and as Paul, and Silas, Act. 16.25. and as Mr.
Philpot and his fellows did in the Bishop of London's Coal-house. In the
night-season it is, Act. and Mon.
that God gives his beloved sleep; and keeps them and theirs then in safety.
Or, if he hold them waking, he fills them with many sweet meditations, (their
reins at that time especially, instructing them, Psalm. 16.7.) shines upon
them by his Moon and Stars (which praise God in their courses, and twinkle as
it were at us to do the like) and inmindeth them by the melody made by the
Nightingale, which sings for fifteen nights and days together without
intermission, Plin. l 10. c. 29^ Luscinia diciu^ quia ante lucep^ canit. Nec
quantum lusciniae dormiunt. Proverb. In En^hir.
if Pliny may be believed: putting a thorn to her breast to keep her waking, for
that purpose. Hereupon Epictetus has this savoury saying, Si luscinia essem,
facerem quod luscinia; Cum antem homo rationalis sim, qui^ faciam? Laudabo
Deum, nec cessabo unquam; Vos vero ut idem faciatis hortor: that is, if I were
a Nightingale, I would do as the Nightingale does; But since I am a man endued
with reason, (since God has taught me more than the fowls of heaven, as Elihu
has it in the next verse) what shall I do? I will uncessantly praise God; and
I exhort you to do the like. But this is not done, says Elihu here, or very
slenderly; and hence it is that men complain of their many and mighty
oppressions, without remedy from God, who sees that his favors and benefits
would be even lost and spilt upon them; according to that of the Philosopher,
Ingrat^ quicquid donatur deperditur; All is cast away, that is conferred upon
an ungrateful person.

Verse 11. Who teaches us more then the beasts of the earth?] This many
wretched people never consider; and are therefore heavily, but worthily, vexed
by oppressors, ut vexatio det intellectum, that smart may make wit; and that
they may not bellow as beasts do, when they feel pain: but fly to God by
well-prepared prayer, not so much for ease, as for the use of what they suffer.
Now, blessed is the man whom God chasteneth, and withal teaches him out of his
Law: that he may give him rest from the days of adversity, Psalm. 94.12, 13.
Hereunto, not only Reason is required, (the Mercy here mentioned, and
celebrated) but Religion also; which is the true Philosophers stone that makes
golden afflictions, 1 Pet. 1.7. and as Moses his hand, turns a Serpent into a
Rod. The truth is, Religion is the highest reason, (neither is any thing more
irrational than irreligion, 2 Thessalonians. 3.2) and this also God alone teaches.
For, Cathedram habet in coelo qui corda docet, says Austin. And again, Quando
Christus Magister, quam cito discitur quod docetur? It is God above, who
teaches the heart: and this if he once undertake, it is soon dispatched. All
this, if sinful men would well weight, and be thankful for, as they ought, God
would surely help them, and not suffer them so to be held under.

And makes us wiser than the fowls of heaven] Sapientificat. Some Birds are
very silly, Plin. l. 10. c. 1.
as the Struthiocamelus, that having thrust his head into a thicket, and seeing
no body, thinks that therefore none sees him, and so makes himself a prey.
Doves sit in their dove-cotes, and see their nests destroyed, their young ones
taken away and killed before their eyes: neither ever do they offer to rescue,
or revenge. Mention is made by Writers, of a certain namelesse little Bird,
which for fear lest the Heavens should fall upon her, Cael. Rhod.
puts always, when she sleeps, one foot upon her head: How much better the
Bird Onocrotalus? of whom it is reported, that out of expectation of the Hawk
to grapple with her, she sleeps with her beak exalted, as if she would
contend with her adversary. Something there is that the wisest may learn from
the fowls of the air, to whom therefore they are sent and set to school, Mat.
6.26. Jer. 8.7. yet generally God has put more understanding into men: so that
as he should not do like them by preying upon others, so he should not cry unto
God only in distress, as the young Raves do when hunger-bit: but pray always,
and in every thing give thanks; for which purpose it is, that God has given us
reason, speech, and much matter and means, far above the unreasonable
Creatures. Vae igitur stupiditati hominum in calamitatibus torpentium.

Verse 12. There they cry, but none gives answer] Cry they do, but not to the
true God, Jon. 1.5. The Papists have their he-saints, and she-saints, for
several uses. Or if to the true God, yet not in a due manner: not in faith, and
with remorse for their misdoings. And hence it is, that either they are not
heard and helped: or not in mercy, but for a further mischief, and to furnish
out their indictment at the last day: and on their deathbeds, God will not
come at them, or be entreated by them, Prove. 1.28. Psalm. 18.42.

Because of the pride of evil men] i. e. Because these oppressed ones that thus
cry, are not so poor as proud; humbled they are, but not humble; low, but not
lowly. Plectuntur, sed non flectuntur: they have lost the fruit of their
afflictions, and are not a button the better for all that they have suffered.

Verse 13. Surely God will not hear vanity] Prayer without Faith, is but an
empty ring, a tinkling cymbal. Neque enim omnes qui citharam habent, sunt
citharoedi; Every sound is not Music, neither is every complaint and outcry
of men in extremity, an effectual Prayer. Those in Hosea, when pined almost,
howled as Dogs, growled as Swine, bellowed as Bulls, screeched horribly as the
Ravens of Arabia, Hos. 7.14 but because they cried not to God with their
hearts, he heard them not. It is not the labor of the lips, or the loudness
of the voice, but the travel of the heart, and truth in the inward parts that
he regards: Psalm. 51.6. Will thou not know, O vain (or empty) man, that Faith
without Works is dead? says St. James chap. 2.20. so that prayer without faith
is to no purpose? Men may cry aloud in distress, and make their voices to be
heard on high; they may chatter out a charm when Gods chastening is upon them,
yea, be with child, as it were, of a prayer, yet bring forth nothing better
than wind, work no deliverance at all in the earth, Isai. 26.16, 17, 18. God
may turn them off, and justly, with Depart ye workers of iniquity; get you to
the gods whom ye have chosen, let them deliver you in the time of your
tribulation: for I will deliver you no more, Judge. 10. verse. 13, 14.

Neither will the Almighty regard it] Heb Look intently into it. It is other,
and better fruit of affliction that he looks for. Whereof missing, he looks
another way, as it were, and takes no notice of their prayers, or pressures.
Hence they deny, or at least doubt of the divine providence: and are ready to
let fly at God, as the Chinese whip their gods, if they help them not at a
call.

Verse 14. Although thou say thou shall not see him, etc.] This is that
tertium Jobi pronuntiatum, Jobs third speech, which Elihu takes upon him to
reprehend and refute: It is taken out of chap. 23.8, 9. and the sense is, that
God would never appear to do him right. But although thou say such a thing,
and so seem to chime in with those wicked ones who deny Gods providence; yet
thou ought to be better preswaded of his presence with thee, and providence
over thee: for judgment is before him, and he will certainly do right; only
thou must give glory to God, and wait his time.

Yet judgment is before him] Or, Judge thy self in his sight; give glory to
God, and confess thy sin: and then, stepping from the Bar to the Bench, judge
thy self worthy to be destroyed, 1 Corinthians. 11. verse. 31. This do, and then

Trust thou in me] For safety here, and salvation hereafter; acting thy Faith
upon the precious promises, Pia and salubris adhortatio. Mercer.
and hopefully expecting the performance thereof in due time. This was
excellent counsel indeed, and worthy of all acceptance.

Verse 15. But now, because it is not so, he has visited in his anger] Because
thou have not yet done as I have prescribed, God is forced thus to treat thee,
and to increase his plagues upon thee in great displeasure at thine
incorrigiblenesse. Thus is good Job miscensured, whom God suffered so to be
afflicted for his trial, and not for his punishment; though there wanted not in
him cause enough, if God should have taken advantags. But know now, that his
anger has visited thee but a little; (this is Beza's translation of the whole
verse) neither has he made any great inquisition. Piscator reads this and
the next verse thus; But now, because his anger has not visited, neither has
he taken notice of the multitude of his sins very much: therefore does Job open
his mouth with vanity, and heap up words without knowledge. Tremellius thus,
For now, because there is nothing of these, does his anger visit thee: viz.
because thou neither rightly judge thy self, nor waitest upon God: but
look upon thy self as utterly undone, casting away all hope of better,
therefore art thou yet held under.

Yet he knows it not in great extremity] Job perceives not (so blind he is)
though he have his back-burden of afflictions, and knows not how to be rid of
them. This, Elihu speaks to the company, by an angry Apostrophe.

Verse 16. Therefore does Job open his mouth in vain] Dilarat, divaricat,
rictum diducit ut bellua. An open mouth is often a purgatory to the Master:
digito compesce labellum.

He multiplieth words without knowledge] Eliphaz had charged Job with malice
and blasphemy, chap. 22. Elihu only with vanity, and ignorance. We may not make
the worst of things, but give a favorable interpretation.

CHAP. XXXVI. Verse 1. Elihu also proceeded and said]
HEB. And Elihu added, viz. This his fourth Oration (not unlike the former)
made in behalf, and for defense of Gods Justice, which he here further
asserteth against Job (who had seemed to cast some slur upon it) by arguments
drawn from his wondrous works, the Meteors especially: and all to prevail with
Job, to submit to Gods justice, Ex abundanti quae sequuntur adjicit.
and to implore his mercy.

Verse 2. Suffer me a little, and I will show thee] He promises brevity, and
thereby wooeth attention: brevity and perspicuity are to great graces of
speech, and do very much win upon intelligent hearers, who love to hear much in
few, and cannot away with tedious prolixities. When a great Trifler had made an
empty discourse in the presence of Aristotle, and then cried him mercy for
troubling him so long: You have not troubled me at all, said He, for I scarce
hearkened to any one word you said all this while.

That I have yet to speak on Gods behalf] Heb. That there are yet words for
God. His zeal for Gods glory drew from him this following speech, wherein
insignis est Elihu and magnificus: Elihu excels himself; and appears to be
no worse an Orator then was M. Crassus among the Romans, Cic. de Orat. l. 1.
who had this commendation given him, Quod cum aliquid accuratius dixisset,
semper fere contigit ut nunquam dixisse melius putaretur, That when ever he
spoke, it was judged to be the very best that ever he spoke.

Verse 3. I will fetch my knowledge from afar] Even from heaven, as one taught
of God; I will discourse of ancient things (for (...)) and fetch my reasons
from the wonderful and sublime works of God, De arduis atque admirandis Dei
operibus.
those real demonstrations of his Deity. Est autem plane hic Elihu mirus and
egregius, says Mercer: And he is not a little wronged by that French
Paraphrast, who says of him, That he knew well how to begin a discourse, but
knew not how to end it: and that seeing well that his tediousness might make
him troublesome, he awakened his languishing Auditors by this artificial
preface.

And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker] This is both the maine
proposition of the ensuing Oration, and the main end of man's creation; viz. to
glorify his Maker, Romans 11. ult. Rev. 4.11.

Verse 4. For truly my words shall not be false] I shall deal truly and plainly
with thee, my Discourse shall be simple and solid, having no better ornament
but that of Truth; which is like our first parents, most beautiful, when naked;
'twas sin covered them, it is treachery hides this. Aperta veritas clausos etiam
oculos ferit, says One.

He that is perfect in knowledge is with thee] Integer sententiis; V^^abl.
meaning himself, who fully understood the business betwixt them, and would
faithfully deliver it. There are that hold God to be hereby meant. A pious
sense, but not so proper.

Verse 5. Behold God is mighty, and despises not any] Much less oppresses he
any one in a good Cause, or tyrannically abuses his power to the crushing of
an Innocent. He is equally good, as great; neither was Job well advised in
seeming to sunder these two excellencies in God, the one from the other; since
whatsoever is in God is God; neither ought we to think of him otherwise, then
of one not to be thought of; as of one, whose Wisdom is his Justice, whose
Justice is his Power, whose Power is his Mercy, and all Himself.

He is mighty in strength and wisdom] Or, He is mighty the strength of the
heart. He was so to David, Psalm. 138.3. Validus est, virt^ animi. Trem
In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me, and strengthnedst me with
strength in my soul. At the sack of Ziglag, in the fail of all outward
comforts, David encouraged himself in the Lord his God, 1 Samuel 30.6. A
Christian is never without his cordial.

Vna est in trepida mihi re medicina, Jehovae
Cor patrium, os verax, omnipotensque manus.
Verse 6. He preserves not the life of the wicked] He is no such friend to
them (though he be good to the godly) he greatly cares not what becomes of
them. Their life they hold of him, and many good things besides; for he is the
Savior (or Preserver) of all men, but especially of them that believe. But he
suffers not the wicked to live (as the Hebrew here has it) he withdraws
them not from the hand of Justice, he binds not them up in the bundle of
life, he reckons them not among the living in Jerusalem, among the first
born, whose names are written in heaven: he many times slays them with his
own hand, and cutteth them short in righteousness: Or if not so, yet their
preservation is but a reservation, etc.

But gives right to the poor] Or, To the afflicted. For poverty is an
affliction, and subjecteth a man to many injuries; Zeph. 3.12. they are an
afflicted and poor people, but trusting in the name of the Lord, they shall be
relieved and righted, not so soon perhaps as themselves would, nor yet so long
hence as their Oppressors would. In the Mount will the Lord be seen, who as he
seldom comes at our times, so he never fails his own time. Mean while this
comfort they have:

Verse 7. He with draws not his eyes from the righteous] He is so lost in
love (as I may say) toward such, that he cannot like to look beside them: he
beholds them when afflicted with singular care and complacency. Then, if
ever, The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears open to their
cry, Psalm. 34.15 then they may have any thing of God, their being no time like
that for hearing of prayers, Zach. 13.9. Times of affliction are times of
supplication, Psalm. 50.15. and 91.15. They are Mollissima fandi tempora, Jer.
51.19, 20, 21. Then our hearts are largest, then Gods ears are openest. Neither
his ears only, but his eyes too are busied about his suffering servants, as
the Goldsmiths are about the Gold cast into the furnace, that no grain thereof
be lost. He sits down by the fire, says Malachi, and tends it, as a Refiner
and Purifier of silver, chap. 3.3. He refines them, but not as silver, Isai.
48.10. that is, Not exactly, and to the utmost, lest they should be consumed in
that fiery trial: he sees to it, that the choice spirits of his people fail
not before him, Isai. 57.16. as they would do, if he should bring upon them an
evil, an only evil, Ezekiel. 7.5. and not in the midst of judgment remember mercy.

But with Kings are they on the throne] i.e. He raises them to highest honors,
as he did Joseph; whose fetters God in one hour changed into a chain of Gold,
his stocks into a Chariot, his Jaile into a Palace, his Rags into fine linen,
etc. yea, as Jeremy's rags helped to draw him out of the dungeon, so do
afflictions work out to Gods people, an exceeding exceeding, eternal weight of
glory. Here perhaps they may be held under, but to him that overcomes, will the
Lord Christ grant to sit with him in his throne, Rev. 3.21. The deluge of
calamities may assault them, but it shall certainly exalt them. They shall have
Crowns on their heads, and Palms in their hands, and walk arm in arm with
Angels. Some of the Hebrews by Kings here understand Angels, as if it were
written (...), not Melachim, but Maleachim.

Yea, he does establish them for ever, and they are exalted] Or, When they are
exalted. This no earthly Prince can promise himself. Dionysius, who thought his
Kingdom had been tied to him with cords of Adamant, was at length driven out of
it. But Christ's Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and he will not reign alone;
if we suffer with him, we shall also reign together. Romans 8.

Verse 8. And if they be bound in fetters] If it so fall out, that through
abuse of their prosperity and preferment, they wander as they are men, out of
the right way, and God sends out afflictions as his Pursuivants to attach them,
and say them in cold irons for their correction, and to prevent judgment,
Psalm. 107.10.

And be holden in cords of affliction] Or, Poverty; so that irretiti funibus
misere vixerint (as the Tigurines here translate) they have only prisoners
pittances, which will neither keep them alive, nor suffer them to dye.

Verse 9. Then he shows them their work] By these sharp waters he clears up
their eyesight, and gives them to see their sin the mother of their misery.
Vexatio dat intellectum; Smart makes wit. Manasseh for instance, and the
Prodigal, Herodot. lib. 1. Live. decad. 1. l. 5.
and King Croesus with his Nocumenta documenta, and Tullus Hostilius with his
excess of devotion, when once he had paid for his learning.

And their transgressions that they have exceeded] Heb When they prevail; that
before they grow too potent they may cast them away; Ne illis victi in Gehennam
descendant, lest they hale them into hell. Mercer.


Verse 10. He opens also their ear to Discipline] See on chap. 33.16.

And commands that they return from iniquity] Unless they will have it to be
their ruin; whereof obstinate sinners, (who refuse to return,) seem to be
ambitious. Affliction sanctified, is Lex practica, a practical Law, says One:
it is Verus Scripturae commentarius, an excellent Comment upon the Scripture,
says Another. David could not learn Gods Statutes till taught by this
Free-School-master; cursed enough and crabbed, but such as whereby God opens
men's ears to Discipline, and speaks to them to return from iniquity, which
is a piece of learning, that people cannot pay too dear for.

Verse 11 If they obey and serve him, they shall, etc.] Heb. They shall finish,
they shall spend and end their days in prosperity, and their years in
pleasure, as Joseph, Job, and some others have done, who lived and dyed with
glory. Howbeit this Promise is to be understood with exception of the Cross,
which yet God both can, and to his, will make profitable and pleasant; as he
did to that godly Prince, who being asked, How he could so well endure so long
and hard imprisonment? answered, That he had therein felt the divine
Consolations of the Martyrs. But, Haud facile invenies multis e millibus unum,
Virtutem pretium qui putet esse sui.


Verse 12. But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword] In gladium
transibunt; they shall pass away by the sword; that is, some evil end shall
befall them, and worthily, because they would not be warned, which is both a
presage and desert of utter ruin. Lesser and lighter judgments (where they
work not) are foretokens of greater and heavier at the heels of them; as the
black horse in the Revelation follows the red. And as clouds cluster against
a storm, one following in the neck of the other, unless the Sun break forth
and scatter them; so do Gods judgments usher in one another, and every less a
greater, unless Repentance, and better obedience take up the matter.

And they shall dye without knowledge] Heb. Because they were without
knowledge; and wilfully so. It was not a bare ^escience, but an affected
ignorance that undid them. Some render it, Non praesentientes, they shall dye
suddenly, and before they have bethought themselves. It should be our care,
that death do not suddenly surprise us. No guest comes unawares to him, who
keeps a constant Table. Every sharp affliction is a warning piece, and let us
so conceive of it. Stillicidia praecedunt ruinam.

Verse 13. But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath] Or, Yet: Or, Howbeit q.d.
These foul sinners, that have turned repentance into a form, and converted
conversion it self into sin, though they see bad men made good, and good men
made better by their afflictions, and incorrigible persons destroyed before
their eyes, yet they amend not by Gods hand upon them, but are the worse for
it: as Iron grows more cold after a heat, and as naughty boys are more stupid
and more stubborn after a whipping. Hypocritis nihil stupidius. These hollow
hearted ones heap up wrath against the day of wrath, as St. Paul makes up this
saying, Romans 2.5. which shall fall upon the Jew first, because of his pretense
to Religion, and then upon the Gentile. Nemo enim magis iram meretur, quam
amicum simulans ini^micus, says Bernard; No man more deserves wrath upon
wrath, then a feigned friend, but true enemy. Such are all hypocrites, whether
gross or close. And hence our Saviors severity against such in the Gospel, but
especially Mat. 23. Neither let any such Goat in sheep-skin think to steal on
Christ's right hand at the last day: He shall uncase such and cashiere them, yea
cast them into the hottest fire of hell, whereof hypocrites are as the
Freeholders, and other sinners but as Tenants to them, for they shall have
their portion with the Devil and hypocrites. Some render it, Ponunt ir^m, and
expound it incandescunt in Deum: When they are afflicted, they wax hot against
God, they gather wrath as a toad swells when handled, as a Serpent gathers
poison to spue out at those who meddle with him.

They cry not when God binds them] Cry they do after a sort, as Hogs do when to
be stuck, or dogs, when tied up from their meat. Murmr they do, and
expostulate a wrong with God, as those, Isa. 58.2, 3. Non ita Deos coluimu^, as
that heathen hypocrite said, We have not served God so well, that he should
serve us no better: but pray they do not, unless it be as those hypocrites in
Zachary, chap. 7. who fasted to themselves, and prayed for their own ends, more
to get off, their chains then their sins. They bear fruit to themselves, as
Ephraim, and see what comes of it.

Verse 14 They dye in youth] They dye before their time, as Solomon expresses
it; then, when it were better for them to do any thing then to dye, for they
are killed with death, as Jezebels children were, Rev. 2. Their soul dies, as
the Hebrew here has it. Their soul perishes among the boys, their life among
that buggerers; as Beza translateth this Text, and thus Paraphraseth. Therefore
as accursed before God they dye, and are reckoned amongst those impure young
men, whose youth being spent in all filthiness and uncleanness, was subject
to that most abominable lust which is not to be named. The sum of all is, says
Brentius, Hypocrita peribit turpiter; The Hypocrite shall once come to a
shameful end. And when the foul sinner shall be damned, what shall become of
the fair Professor? God will lead such forth with the workers of iniquity,
yea, with the worst kind of sinners (Sodomites for instance) shall he punish
them.

Verse 15. He delivers the poor in his affliction.] Often in this life, as he
did David signally, Psalm. 34.6. 2 Timothy 4.
This poor man (meaning himself) cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him
out of all his troubles. So he pulled Paul out of the mouth of the Lion, yea,
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and preserve me unto his
heavenly kingdom; where the Saints shall be sure of full deliverance, and
shall say of their afflictions, as that Adulteress said of her accusers, John
8. They are all gone.

He opens their ears in oppression] Or, By oppression, as by a key; he
opens the ears of their hearts to holy and wholesome counsel. This Elihu had
said before; but he says it again for that end and purpose, that Job might
rowse up, and raise up himself to the hope of a comfortable restoration; for
as much as God afflicts, not his to destroy them, but to make them partakers
of his holiness; and that once done, to deliver them.

Verse 16. Even so would he have removed thee, etc.] The sin revocat ad
hypothesin; Here Elihu applies to Job that which he had more generally
discoursed concerning godly men's afflictions turned to their greatest good, if
they be careful to improve the same. Heb. He would have persuaded, or gently
removed thee.

Out of the strait, etc.] Heb. Out of the mouth of the strait. A Metaphor from
wild beasts, that hold some prey in the mouth, says Piscator. Or from a pit,
narrow at the top, and wide at the bottom, as R. Solomon, and some others, who
understand it of hell. Brentius to the same sense renders the Text thus,
Eripiet te ab ore angustiae lato, sub quo nullum est fundamentum, He shall
deliver thee from the broad mouth of straitness, under which there is no bottom.

And that which should be set on the table, etc.] Thou should eat of the fat,
and drink of the sweet, thou should have known no want of any thing, if thou
had not been wanting to thy self, in making the best use of thy troubles.
See Psalm. 23.5.

Verse 17. But thou have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked] But thou
contrarily blusterest against God, and blurtest out such words, that thou
seem to be as bad as the worst, and to have little or no goodness in thee.
See chap. 34 8. It is a shame to Gods people to symbolize with the wicked; to
be carnal in their speeches or carriages, and to walk as men, 2 Cor. 3.3. They
should so speak; and so do; as those that shall be judged by the Law of
liberty, Jam. 2.12.

Judgment and justice take hold of thee] Thou art worthily attached by the
divine justice, which thou have quarrelled.

Verse 18. Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
stroak] Beza reads it thus, Surely it is wrath, take heed lest with strokes
it take thee away; i.e. Certainly the wrath of God does in this thy calamity
most manifestly show it self. Oh beware lest he double his strokes, and beat
thee to pieces for thy disobedience and stubbornness. With the froward God will
wrestle, Psalm. 18.26. and add to their miseries seven times more, and seven
times and seven to that, Levit. 26.18, 21, 24, 28.

Then a great ransom cannot deliver thee] Heb. Turn thee aside, or help thee
to decline; that is, to escape, no though thou should offer thousands of
Rams, or ten thousand Rivers of Oil, as Mie. 6.7.

Verse 19. Will he esteem thy riches?] Tremellius renders it, Thy Nobility.
Others read it thus, Will be regard thy crying in thine adversity? Or, That
thou should not abide in adversity? See Proverb. 10.2. and 11.4. with the
Notes.

No, not gold] Which yet can do much with men. The Hebrew word signifies,
finest gold, Job. 22.24. and has its name from defending, because gold is a
man's defense: With men it may be so, but not with God, Zeph. 1.18. See the Note
there. Others read it, No not in affliction.

Nor all the forces of strength] Which are poor things in comparison of God,
whose weakness is stronger then men, Conantia frangere fra^gunt.
1 Corinthians. 1.25. He need but to arise, and his enemies shall be scattered:
yea, all that hate him, shall fly before him, Psalm. 68.1. As the Rocks repel
the greatest waves, so does God his enemies.

Verse 20. Desire not the night, etc] That is, as some sense it, do not thou
peevishly desire death (see chap. 7.15.) lest it comes too soon, and it do by
thee, as it does by many an one, whom it cuts off in judgment. For surely in
the state thou art now in, thou ought to fear an extraordinary kind of
death, an inlet to eternal destruction, as in the Deluge, Sodom and Egypt.
Others render it thus, Neither let it disquiet thee in the night, how people
are destroyed out of their place; that is, in the night season, Vatabl.
when thy mind is void of cares, puzzle not thy self how and why some Nations
perish, and not others, but rather rest thy self upon Gods providence and
unsearchable wisdom, Beza.
and trouble not thy head in searching out the cause of this so sudden
misfortune. Brentius makes this the sense, Noli impie agere; Desire not the
night; that is, Deal not wickedly by complaining against God, and impatiently
bearing his hand; as Thieves and Adulterers desire the night for dispatch of
their deeds of darkness. Think not thou to hide thy self in the dark from the
dint of Gods displeasure.

When people are cut off in their place] Heb. Ascend under them: i.e. Rise,
that they may fall, Psalm. 102.10. as the light of a candle when it is ready to
go out, flies up, and then vanishes away: Or as the corn is first taken up by
the hand of the Reaper, and then cut off, and laid flat on the ground.

Verse 21. Take heed, regard not iniquity] This especially of blaming Gods
judgments, as if they were unequal. No more of that, says Elihu. Cave tibi,
ne conjicias oculos ad vanitatem, Beware thou cast not an eye toward such a
vanity or iniquity as that is. This was very good counsel; and it is very well
observed, that this whole following Treatise to the end of the thirty seventh
chapter, is as it were a gentle lenitive of that foregoing sharp rebuke which
otherwise was likely to drive Job beside all patience.

For this thou have chosen rather then affliction] That is, this forementioned
iniquity of speaking rashly and wickedly against Gods proceedings with thee;
this thou have chosen rather then to bear thine affliction (or, thy poverty)
patiently. Now this was an ill choice; for, Epist. 3.
quas non oportet mortes praeligere, says Zuinglius; What deaths ought not a
man rather to make choice of, what torments not rather undergo, yea, into what
deepest gulf of hell it self not rather enter, then wittingly and willingly to
sin against God? The ancient Martyrs would not be delivered upon base terms,
Heb 11.35. Tertul.
Daniel chose rather to be thrown to the Lions, then to violate his conscience,
and so to have a Lion roaring in his own bosom. The Primitive Christians cried
out, Ad Leonem magis quam Lenonem. I had rather enter into hell, being clear
from sin and innocent, quam peccati sorde pollutus, coelorum regna tenere, then
go to heaven, if I might, besmeared with the filth of sin, faith Anselm. I had
rather leap into a Bonfire and be burnt, said another of the Ancients, then
commit any sin against God. Pint^ ir. Daniel.
Some write, that there is a certain little beast, called the Mouse of Armenia,
which will rather dye then be defiled with any filth: insomuch that if her hole
be besmeared with dirt, she will rather choose to be taken then polluted. Such
ought the servants of God to be.

Verse 22. Behold, God exalts by his power.] Vulg. God is high in his
strength. He both exalts himself and others, whenever he pleases. Beza
reads it, Behold God in his strength is above all; q.d. It is he that must
restore thee, if ever thou be restored.

Who teaches like him?] Vulg. None amongst the Lawgivers is like unto him.
But the word Moreh signifies a Doctor or a Teacher; as Moreh Nebuchim, a
Teacher of perplexed things, an unriddler of Riddles. He knows all things
exactly, and does all things with singular skill and understanding. He has many
ways of teaching people, and making them to profit, Isai. 48.17. and one is,
by afflictions, which Luther therefore fitly calls Theologiam Christianorum;
the Christians System of Divinity; as has been before noted. Mr. Ascham was a
good Schoolmaster (says one) to Q. Elizabeth, but affliction was a better.

Verse 23. Who has enjoined him his way?] q.d. Will thou take upon thee to
teach this great Teacher how to govern the world? This were a strange kind of
arrogance.

Or, Who can say, Thou have wrought iniquity?] Gods judgments are sometimes
secret, but always just. Let not men reprehend what they do not yet
comprehend, but content themselves with a learned ignorance, till God shall
further discover himself, saying of Gods Works, as Socrates did of a certain
Book that he had read, What I understand therein is very good, and so I think
is that I understand not. When we come into an Artificers shop, we see many
Tools, the use whereof we know not, and yet we conclude they are of some use.
Why then should men rashly censure Gods proceedings, which are many times in
mediis contrariis, In Genes. (...) Naz. in Cypr.
as Luther was wont to say, brought about by contrary means; that he may be the
more admired, as Nazianzen gives the reason. The Artificer with a crooked Tool
makes straight work. The Apothecary makes of a poisonful Viper a wholesome
Triacle: so here. Far be it from us therefore to charge God with iniquity, for
this were, with those mad Manichees, to affirm, Manichaeorum diabolicus
sarcasmus. Paraeus.
That till he had created light, he dwelt in darkness, as if God were not an
eternal Light, 1 John 1.5. 1 Timothy 6.16.

Verse 24. Rememember that thou magnify his works] His work of Creation;
wherein the wisdom, power, and goodness of God is clearly manifested, Romans
1.19 in that glorious structure of the heavens especially, which men behold. Or
his work of Administration, and Gubernation, whereof David says, All thy Works
praise thee, O Lord; that is, they yield matter of magnifying thee; and thy
Saints shall bless thee, Psalm. 145.10. Remember that this be done, says
Elihu. Junius by Gods Works here understands Noah's Flood.

Which men behold] Or, Whereof men do sing, saying, Id quod and prudentes viri
olim veluti gnoma quadam and communi sententia jactarunt, dicentes, Omnis homo
aspicit etc. Brent.
as in the next verse,

Verse 25. Every man may see it] scil. In quo est vel mica bonae mentis; for a
brutish man knows it not, Psalm. 92.6, 7. But stupidus est, and dignus cui
oculi eruantur says Plato. He is a very blockhead, and worthy to have his eyes
pulled out of his head, who looks not above him, and about him, that he may
magnify and admire the wisdom of the Creator of all, and Preserver of mankind.

Man may behold it afar off] For heaven is far above earth, and it is a wonder
that we can look to so admirable an height, and that the very eye is not tired
in the way. And for things that are nearer to us, we see them but as through a
glass obscurely; our knowledge of them is very imperfect, 1 Cor 11.13. the
reason of many things is above our reach. We read of one who had spent above
forty years in finding out the Nature and Property of Bees, and yet was not
fully satisfied of many things therein.

Verse 26. Behold God is great] Yea, he is maximus in minimis, Greatest and
most of all seen in the meanest creatures; as in Ants more then in Elephants,
etc. Brent.
God shows in his works of all sorts, se aliquantum esse; sed quantus sit
ru^sus, operibus involuit; that he is very great, but how great he is, that
appears not.

Neither can the number of his years be searched out] How should they say, when
as his countenance is beyond all count, Psalm. 102.24, 27. Dan. 5
Years are here ascribed unto him, and he is elsewhere called Ancient of
days, and the hairs of his head are said to be white like snow, Rev. 1.14.
but all this is spoken of God after the manner of men; and should teach us,
neither curiously to enquire into his counsels, nor discontentedly to complain
of his doings.

Verse 27. For he makes small the drops of water] Here Elihu begins to
instance the greatness of God in his works, and particularly in the Meteors;
many of which Aristotle confesses he understood not. And this I dare say,
says a learned Interpreter here, that there is not extent any Poem, either of
the Greeks or Latins, which may be compared with this stately eloquence of
Elihu in describing those natural effects which are caused in the air; and for
the same cause are of the Philosophers called Meteors, or aerie impressions: as
namely, clouds, rain hail, snow, thunder, lightning, and suchlike; whereof he
here discourses very gravely, and learnedly: And first of rain, which he
describes, 1. by the form or manner of producing it, verse. 27, 28. 2. by the
largeness of the clouds, and their noise, verse. 29. 3. by the sudden
succession of fair weather and foul, verse. 30. and lastly, by the different use
thereof in the three last verses of this Chapter, God makes small the drops of
water; that is, he raineth by dividing the drops in the cloud, causing them to
come down gut^atim, piece-meale; and not by whole spouts, or paile-fulls.
Others read it, Subtrahit Deus, God draws up drops of water; viz. out of the
Sea, the rivers, and other moist places, whence those vapors do ascend, of
which are generated those drops of rain, Psalm. 147.8. He covers the heaven
with clouds, he prepares rain for the earth, etc.

They power down rain according to the vapors thereof] As the vapors are
greater or lesser, so is the rain. The rain ascends in thin vapors, but
descends often in thick showers: So do our poor Prayers come down in greatest
blessings; and we are sure of as much mercy, as we bring faith to carry it away.

Verse 28. Which the clouds do drop, and distill upon man abundantly] Hence the
Dutch call it raegen, and we rained, a rigando, from watering the earth all
over, at times: This is Gods work, and it ought to be mavelous in our eyes:
it would be so, were it not so ordinary. Non sactis id ascribamus, multo minus
sagis; the Heathens gave their gods the glory of it. The holy Ghost here, and
elsewhere, sets before us these common things, that when we see them, and yet
know not the reason of them, we may gather, that we ought not over-curiously to
pry into the profound judgments of God, which are far above the clouds, those
receptacles of rain; yea, far above the highest heavens.

Verse 29. Also can any understand the spreading of the clouds?] That is, the
skill that God shows in spreading forth the clouds to that large extent, and
muffling the whole heavens with them; so that Nature finds her self buried in
darkness? Some render it; the divisions, or differences of the clouds; illic
enim fiunt miracula magna. For some clouds are empty, Vatab.
and answer not expectation (worthless and vain boasters are compared to such,
R. Levi.
Prove. 25.14. Jude 12.) some yield rain, and drop fatness. Some again, send
forth hail, snow, frost, storm, thunder, lightnings, etc. These are wonders in
nature, far beyond humane apprehension. The clouds God makes one while as some
aerie seas, to hold water; another while as some aerie furnaces, whence he
scatters the sudden fires into all parts of the earth, astonishing the world
with the fearful noise of that eruption. Out of the midst of water he fetches
fire, and hard stones out of the midst of thin vapors. Haec sunt sane
admiranda and tremenda, says Mercer. These are wonderful things, and no less
dreadful. Is it not strange, that of one and the same equal matter, viz. the
vapors exhaled from the earth or water, so many several and different Meteors
should be engendered?

Or the noise of his Tabernacle] i.e. The swinging showers, or rustling winds,
or rattling thunderclaps, one in the neck of another, out of the clouds, called
here, Gods Tabernacle; in quo velut abditus, tot rerum miracula creat, wherein
he sits in secret and unseen, creating many strange Meteors to send down upon
the earth; whereof the profoundest Philosopher of them all can give no certain
and undoubted reason.

Verse 30. Behold, he spreads his light upon it] That is, his fair weather,
clearing up the cloudy sky, as some expound it: Or, us others, his lighting
shot forth every way, Psalm. 18.13, 15. and 144.6. Or the sunbeams spread upon
the sea, and drawing up vapors; unde mare hoc loco nubium radix dicitur, says
Brentius, whence the sea is here called the root of the clouds: or the surface
of the sea is called the root of it, in regard of the wandering waves which are
cut in sunder, after the manner of roots; so says Vatablus. Those that by
light here understand lightnings say, that God makes them dart so abundantly
through the waters of the sea, that they do as it were cover all the bottom of
it.

Verse 31. For by them judges he the people] i.e. By rain and drought in
excess or defect, he punishes people at his pleasure: whom, oh how easily
could he affamish by denying them an harvest or two: in granting whereof, he
gives testimony of his bounty, Job 14.17.

He gives meat in abundance] sc. By sending moderate showers fatning the
earth: whereunto also the preaching of the Word is fitly compared, Isai.
55.10.11. which those that drink not in and fructify, Deuteronomy. 32.2. are
accursed, Heb. 6.8.

Verse 32. With clouds he covers light] Heb. With the palms of his hands;
(so the clouds are called, see 1 King. 18.44.) he hides light; that is, the
Sunbeams, viz. when he sends rain, the heavens are masked.

And commands it not to shine] Heb. And forbids it (those words, not to
shine, are not in the original) propter intercedentem, Trem. Merlin.
for the sake of those that intercede. He gives rain or fair weather upon the
prayers of his faithful people; who can thereby open and shut heaven, as did
Elias, and the thundering Legion. R. Levi interprets this and the following
verse concerning thunder.

Verse 33. The noise thereof shows concerning it] The hurry-noise made in the
air before a shower of rain, fore-showeth it to be at hand.

The Cattle also concerning the vapour] Heb. Concerning that which goes up:
Hogs, Sheep, Oxen, etc. are much more quick-scented than men; and can perceive
the vapors going up to cause rain, before men can see or feel them. Hence
shepherds and herdsmen gather prognostics of rain, and are so weather-wise, as
we call it. Ad dextram cuhantes oves pluviam portendunt. Merlin.
Aben-Ezra notes, that sheep lying on the right-side, fore-signifie foul
weather. See Virgil. Georg. lib. 1. and Plin. Not. Hist. lib. 18. cap. 35. Some
render this verse (than which there if not an harder in all the book, says
Mercer) thus, Declaring toward him (who intercedeth) his good will, toward the
cattle, and also toward the increase of the earth.

CHAP. XXXVII. Verse 1. At this also my heart trembleth]
AT this? At what? at the thunder, whereof he had spoken before, Beza. Diodat.
and more meant to speak: and which he heard at that instant, (as it may seem
by the next verse) and therefore no wonder that his heart trembled, and was
moved out of its place by an extraordinary palpitation, or (as the Tigurines
have it) luxation. Thunder is so terrible, that it has forced from the
greatest Atheist an acknowledgement of a Deity. Suetonius tells us of
Caligula, (that Monster, who dared his Jove to a Duel) that if it thundered and
lightened but a little, he would hood-wink himself: but if much, he would creep
under a bed, and be ready to run into a mouse-hole, as we say. Augustus Caesar
also was so afraid of thunder and lightning, that always and every where, he
carried about him the skin of a Sex-Calf, (which those Heathens fondly held to
be a preservative in such cases) and if at any time there arose a great storm,
he ran into a dark vault. The Romans held it unlawful to keep Court Jove
ton^nte, fulgurante, in a time of thunder and lightening, as Tully tells us.
De Divin. lib. 2.
And Isidore deriveth tonitru a terrendo, thunder from its terror; and others,
form its tone, or rushing crashing noise, affrighting all creatures: At the
voice of thy thunder they are afraid, Psalm. 104. which One, not unfitly,
calls David's Physics.

Verse 2. Hear attentively the noise of his voice] Conjunctam commotione vocem
ejus, the great thunder-crack that now is: that angry noise (as the word
signifies) Hear in hearing; you cannot but hear it with the ears of your
bodies, hear it also with the ears of your minds; tremble and sin not;
contrary to the course of most men, who sin and tremble not, drowning the noise
of their consciences, as the old Italians did the thunder, by ringing their
greatest Bells, discharging their roaring-Megs, etc. But what says Elihu here
to his hearers? Audite, audite, audite etiam atque etiam, contremiscetis and
vos, vos testes adhibeo, as Mercer paraphraseth it out of Kimchi: Hear ye, hear
ye, hear ye again and again, and then ye also will tremble. I take you to
witness; whether ye consider his greater thunderclaps ringing and roaring in
your ears (See Psalm. 29.4. and 87.7.) or the lesser rumblings, called here,
Murmur vel Mussitationem, vel habitum, citra quem sermo non profertur; the
sound (or breath) that goes out of his mouth. Aristot. Pliny.
All Is ascribed to God; though Naturalists tell us (and truly) that there are
second causes of thunder and lightning: wherein, nevertheless, we must not
stick, but give God the glory of his Majesty, as David teaches, Psalm. 29. and
as blind Heathens did, when they called their Jove Altitonantem, the high
Thunderer. The best Philosophy in this point is to hear God Almighty by his
thunder speaking to us from heaven as if he were present: and to see him in his
lightnings, as if he cast his eyes upon us to see what we had been doing. His
eyes are as a flaming fire, Rev. 1.14. and the school of nature teaches, that
the fiery eye sees Extra-mittendo, by sending out a ray, etc.

Verse 3. He directs it under the whole Heaven] Heb. He makes it to go right
forward, meaning the thunder, the vehement noise or sound whereof (not
altogether unlike that of cloth violently torn, or of air thrust out of
bellows, or of a chestnut burst in the fire, but far louder) is brought through
the air to our ears with such a mighty force, that it drowns all noises,
clappings, clatterings, roarings even of many waters; making the earth to shake
again, Lavat.
and all things tremble, non secus quam siquis currum onustum per plateam
lapidibus stratam ducat; And this dreadful noise is by God directed to this or
that place under the heavens, at his pleasure. The word rendered (directs)
signifies also Beholds; whence some interpret this text of Gods seeing all
things under heaven. But the former sense is better.

And his lightning unto the ends of the earth] God commands the lightning to
cleave the clouds, and to scatter its flames through the world. Lightning is
the brightness of a shining flame, running through the whole air in a moment,
rising of a small and thin exhalation kindled in a cloud; see Psalm. 18.13. The
natural end and effect of thunder and lightning is, to clear the air by wasting
poisonous vapors. The supernatural is, to show Gods excellent Majesty and
Might, which the Mightiest must acknowledge, Psalm. 29.1, 2. to be his officers
about him to make room for him, Psalm. 97.1, 4. to execute his wrath upon his
enemies, Exodus 9.23.27. Psalm. 77.18, 19. 1 Samuel 2.10. Isai. 29.6. and his mercy
toward his people for the humbling of them, 1 Samuel 12.18, 19, 20, etc. raising
them again to an assured confidence, Psalm. 29.11, etc. But that God can shoot
these arrows of his so far, Mat. 24.27. Psalm. 77.18. and 97.3, 4. and here;
yea, and that at the same time when it raineth, when one would think that the
one should quench the other, Psalm. 135.7. this is a just wonder: and Jeremy
urges it twice, as such, chap. 10.13. and 51.16.

Verse 4. After it a voice roareth] After it, that is, after the lightning, it
thundereth: indeed, before, or at least together with it; but the lightning is
seen before the thunder is heard, because the sense of hearing is slower than
the sense of seeing (thus fire is first seen in a Gun, Segnius irritant animos
demissa per aures, etc. Horat.
ere the report is heard; the Ax of the Wood-cleaver is up for a second blow,
ere we hear the first, if any way distant, etc.) And besides, as R. Levi well
observes here, that the sight of the lightning may come from heaven to us,
there needs no time; because our eyes reach up thither in an instant: but
that a sound may come therehence to us (in regard of the distance, and because
the air must be beaten and many times impressed as into so many circles) there
must be some space of time; neither can it be done so suddenly.

He thundereth with the voice of his excellency] Or, of his height, or, of his
pride. Proud persons think themselves high, and use to speak big-swoln words of
vanity, bubbles of words, as St. Peter calls them. If they be crossed never so
little, verbis bacchantur, and cum quodam vocis impetu loquunter, Oh the
tragedies, the blusters, the terrible thunder-cracks of fierce and furious
language that follow thereupon. Some have been threatened to death, as Cornelius
Gallus was by Augustus Caesar: and Sir Christopher Hatton Lord Chancellor, by
Queen Elizabeth. How much more should men quake and even expire before the
thunder of the most high, or wriggle as worms do into their holes, the corners
of the earth?

And he will not stay them, when his voice is heard] Them, that is, new flashes
of lightning: or, rain and hail, which usually break out either while it
thundreth, or presently after, in a most vehement, and impetuous manner.

Verse 5. God thundereth marvellously with his voice] Or, God thundereth our
mavelous things with his voice] Mavelous indeed, if we consider the effects
of thunder, lightning, and light-bolts, which differ from lightning in form
only, and not in matter; and for the effects thereof Naturalists tell us
strange things: as, that by them the money has been melted, without hurting
the purse; the Sword has been broken within the scabbard, the wine has been
exhausted within the barrel, the bones broke within the flesh, etc. How various
and mavelous the nature, generation, matter, form, effects of the thunder and
thunderbolt are, not only Seneca, Pliny, and other Meteorologists testify,
but daily experience seals to the truth of it.

Great things does he, which we cannot comprehend] As being above the reach of
our shallow capacity: Or, which we will not know; so the Hebrew has it: such
is our oscitancy, or obstinacy, that we will not take knowledge of Gods works
of wonder, though they do even run into our senses. This he construeth for an
high contempt; as a skilful Artificer would do when he has set forth a curious
piece to public view, and none will take notice of it. God seems to have
made the Meteors in such great variety, that therein he might show his own
skill, and their imperfection.

Verse 6. For he says to the snow, Be thou on the earth] He commands it, and
it is done; for together with his word there goes forth a power. Dixisse Dei,
est fecisse, Psalm. 147. God gives snow like wool: Many wonders there are in
snow: as that it should be made in the lowest part of the air, and not above
where it is coldest: that it should snow upon the earth, but never upon the
sea, as Pliny says: that snow should lie continually, not only upon the Alps,
but upon mouth Aetna, where fire flames out: that no snow falls in Egypt; but
in Tartaria, a hot Country; sometime it snoweth in the heat of Summer: that it
serves for a cover to preserve the earths heat, though it self be cold: that
being white, it should sometimes bring forth red worms, etc.

Likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength] Not a drop
of rain, whether it come leasurely or hastily, but falls by a divine decree,
chap. 28.26. see the Note there. The Chaldee Paraphrast understands here the
Summer and Winter-rains. God shows his strength in a thing so weak, and
diffluent of it self, that thereby he may overturn and break in pieces the
proudest of men's spirits: for whom also if they repent not, he has a more
terrible rain, Psalm, 11.6. overflowing with fire and brimstone, Ezekiel. 35.22.

Verse 7. He seals up the hand of every man] i.e. He, by his great showers,
sends men home for shelter, glad to intermit their work till better weather.
See Exodus 9.19. The Hebrews call rain, Sagrir, Prove. 27.15. from shutting up:
because it keeps men at home, from traveling or working abroad. Vide Joan
(...) Indag.
Chiromancie finds here no footing, whatever some have doated: as if God had
set certain signs and notes in men's hands of what should hereafter befall them;
and this text is alleged for proof; but absurdly.

That all men may know his work] i.e. That they may take notice of Gods
handiwork in ordering the seasons: and have time to think on their domestic
affairs.

Verse 8. Then the beasts go into dens] In rainy and snowy weather, the very
wild beasts, (as lively and lusty as they are, whence also they have their name
in the Original) are glad to take harbor, and there to hold them till the
storm be over.

Verse 9. Out of the South comes the whirl-wind] Which is a wonderful wind
indeed; (...), the Greeks call it (as they do a like wind at sea, (...), the
Mariners mischief) the Latins Vorter, because it turns up trees by the
roots, houses by the foundation, Job. 1. And Turbo, as breeding great trouble;
for which cause also Pope Urban was called Turban. It suddenly arises, and as
suddenly cease, but does much mischief, and especially in strait and narrow
places. In allusion whereunto the Apostle would not have people to be wherried
and whirled about, with every wind of Doctrine, Ephesians. 4.14. as unstable souls
use to be. Illebius for instance; who of a Protestant, first turned Antinomian,
and afterward a Papist. So the old Illuminates, boasting at first of a certain
Angelical purity, fell suddenly to the very counterpoint of justifying
beastiality. For prevention of this pernicious lightness, Spec. Europ.
It is good (says the Apostle) that the heart be established with grace, Hebr.
13.9. That men be sound in the faith, well principled, bottomed and ballasted.

And cold out of the North] Heb. Out of the scattered winds. North-winds
scatter the clouds, (...). Hom. Odyss.
clear the Sky, and so bring on fair cold weather. By Mezeri^ here some
understand certain Stars toward the North Pole; Arcturus the Vulgar Latin
renders it.

Verse 10. By the breath of God frost is given] Frost is the excess of cold by
the blowing of the coldest winds, which are here called, The breath of God:
these congeal the waters, and turn them into ice contracting them into a
narrower room. Hence it is, that as any Country is more Northerly, so it is
colder; the sea also is frozen and unpassable.

And the breadth of the waters is straightned] This the same again in other
words, though some understand it of hail: when the broad-flowing water in the
clouds by the force of the cold is narrowed up into hail. All this is of the
Lord. Fides non in ordinem operis, fe^ in authorem oculos suos dirigit, says
Brentius upon the Text: Faith sees God in all.

Verse 11. Also by watering he wearieth the thick clouds] That is, by showring
down of much rain he disburdeneth and dissipateth them, seem they never so
thick and large. These seem to be troubled and tired ^ut when as they are
watering the earth, they are wasted and drawn dry by the heat of the Sun.

He scatters his bright cloud] Heb. The cloud of his light; that is, the
cloud by dissolving whereof he restores light and fair weather, or the cloud
which was covered over with lightning before, chap 36.30.

Verse 12 And it is turned round about by his counsel] Vertit Dominus and
revertit. The Lord turns and returns: lets out, and brings back the
clouds, as it were by a rope, at his own pleasure: a Metaphor from Mariners,
who skilfully manage the ropes of the Ship to best advantage. In like sort the
clouds are, by Gods cunning turned about in a circuit (as Beza renders it)
that is in a round compass or circle; they are not carried up and down the
air by and wandering and inconstant motion: but they are, as it were, by
certain Engines (so he makes the Metaphor) of Almighty God, turned about at
his own pleasure, when and where he thinks good to use them; for he best
knows where is most need of rain, snow, etc. and therefore he by his wisdom
drives them hither and thither, for the fulfilling of his purpose. Some refer
this Text to the revolution of the Heavenly Orbs; which is also done by God.

That they may do whatsoever he commands them] A Metaphor like that Levit.
25.21. where God says that he will command his blessing upon the sixth year;
and it shall bring forth fruit for three years. Now if the senseless creatures
so readily obey God, how much more should we? And if he be Lord of Tempests, he
is also of Diseases and disasters. Cheer up therefore, and ply the throne of
Grace. He will see that all shall go well with his suppliants.

Verse 13. He causes it to come, whether for correction] Heb. For a rod. God
has his rods sticking up in every corner of his house for chastisement of his
children, and they shall take it for a favor too, (...) Sept. Bern.
Hebr. 12.7. r Cor. 11.32. Sinite vergam corr^pi^^t^m, (...) ^^^iutis m^lltum
conterentem, says an Ancient. he co^^^^ with the rod of correction, that ye
feel not maul of confusion. Better suffer immoderate raines and lightnings,
then that terrible tempest, chap. 27.21. and the black flashes of hell fire,
that (...), as Plato calls it; the fiery Lake, as the Scripture.

Or for his Land] i.e. His Church, Hos. 9.3, A Land that he waters and
watches over from one end of the year to the other, Deuteronomy. 11.12.. His vineyard
cared for, and kept to himself night and day, Isai. 27.3. Or, the earth at
large, which is Gods great field, Psalm. 24.1. (as the Church is his fold, Psalm.
100.3.) and especially that part of it which is desert and uninhabited. There
also God causes his Sun to shine, and his rain to fall, Matthew 5.45. Job
38.26, 27. That the wild beasts also may have food.

Or for mercy] Some singular and extraordinary mercy, as 2 Samuel 21.10. 1 King.
18.45. Sive ad faciendum beneficentiam; or to bestow his bounty, and to bestow
a largess; as Princes sometimes make a scatter of moneys among the multitude.
Clouds are Gods Storehouses, which he eft-soons opens to our profit, Deuter.
28.12. By them, he makes a scatter of riches upon the earth; which good men
gather, and bad men scramble for.

Verse 14. Hearken unto this, O Job] Here Elihu by little and little draws to
a most wise conclusion bringing Job to this point, that as the wisdom of God
in these daily and ordinary works of Nature does far exceed the reach and
capacity of man so the should much more consider the same in this grievous
calamity, Beza. Merlin.
which was now befalne him. And for as much as he could not come to the
knowledge of any other secondary and middle causes; he should rather adore and
reverence the secret counsel and purpose of God herein, then labor in vain,
and without any profit at all to torment himself in searching out that which
is not possible for any man to understand. Which argument God himself does at
large most truly and divinely prosecute in the four following Chapters.

Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God] Consiste, considera, and
that thou may see into these divine secrets, Non arrigend^ sunt aures
caruis, sed fidei, Prick up the ears of thy faith, which alone can skill of
these mysteries; whereinto if thou have yet no insight, and can not yet feel
the justice, wisdom and goodness of God in thy present sufferings, it is for
want of judgment* (as I shall evince in that which follows) it is because
thou have not mine eyes, senses habitually exercised to discern good and evil,
Hebr. 5. ult. Nicostratus in Elian, himself being a cunning Artisan, finding a
curious piece of work, and being wondered at by one, and asked, What pleasure he
could take, to stand gazing as he did on the Picture? answered, Had thou mine
eyes thou would not wonder, but rather be ravished as I am, at the inimitable
Art of this rare Piece. Elihu seems here to say as much to Job.

Verse 15. Do thou know when God disposed them?] Viz. Those wondrous works of
God in the Air especially; those varieties of Meteors, the generation and
motions whereof, the greatest Philosophers cannot perfectly find out by their
natural causes, neither do they well agree amongst themselves concerning those
causes. For Anaximander holds one thing, Metrodorus another, Anaxagoras a
third, Aristotle a fourth; let those that have a mind to it, read their
janglings and Disputes in Plutarch, De placitis Philosophorum. Now if no man
(though never so wise) can understand the wondrous works of God in these common
things of Nature; how can he comprehend his hidden works, hoc est, crucem,
says Brentius?

And caused the light of his cloud to shine] Or, That he may cause the light of
his cloud to shine. Hereby he means lightnings, issuing out of the moist and
cold cloud say some, the Rainbow, say others, that wonderful work of God
(fained therefore by the Heathens to be the daughter of Thaumantias, Plato.
or of wonderment) which is full of wonders, witness the beautiful shape
thereof, and various colors, with their several significations, as some
conceive: the several Prognostics; viz. Of rain in the morning, of fair
weather in the evening, as Scaliger concludes; the form of it a bow, which yet
never shoots any man unless it be with astonishment and love, etc. God puts
his bow in his hand (says Ambrose on Genes. 9.13) not his arrow, but his bow,
and the string of the bow is to usward. The Jews conceit that the name
Jehovah is written on the Rainbow, and therefore they no sooner see it, but
they hide their eyes, confess their sins that deserve a second deluge)
celebrate Gods great goodness to mankind, etc. Some by the light of Gods cloud,
here understand the Sunshine through the clouds, causing it to clear up. Now
who can certainly foretell rain or fair weather? Some Learned men have spent
much time and pains in Astronomy to get skill in prognosticating, but could do
little good of it: when they foretell a fair day, it commonly raineth, and the
contrary. The Country man's Prognostics, the Shepherds Calender, hold better
for most part, then the Predictions of these Artisans.

Verse 16. Do thou know the balancings of the clouds?] i.e. How they are
hanged up even in the air, like Architas or Archimedes his Pigeon, equally
poised with their own weight. But how they are upheld, and why they fall here,
and now, we know not, and wonder. Some Naturalists tell us, that the clouds are
upheld by the heat of the Sun: but that's more then they can tell, and there is
much to be said against it. Wherefore it is better for men to confess their
ignorance, then so peremptorily to pronounce of things they know not. Let it be
proper to God to be perfect in knowledge. It was too much that some ascribed to
Tertullian, to Hierom, to Tostatus and some others, that they knew all that was
knowable.

Verse 17 How thy garments are warm, when he etc.] Can thou give a reason of
the extreme heat that is about the Summer-Solstice, when the warm South-winds
blow so gently, that they are scarce felt at all, and thy clothes heated by
thy body are a burden to thee, so that thou art ready to cast them off, and but
for common honesty, thou could go naked? Brentius thinks, That although one
of the winds only is here instanced, yet the disposing of them all is intended;
wherein much of God may be seen: for it is he alone, who holds them in his
fist, hides them in his Treasures, sends them out as his Posts, rides upon
them as his Chariot, 2 Samuel 22.10. Psalm. 104.3. checks them at his pleasure
(whence they concluded Christ's Deity, Matthew. 8.27.) makes them pace orderly
appointing them their motion, etc. chap. 28. Nos motum sentimus, modum
nescimus, Joh 3.8. Thou hear the sound of the wind, but know not whence
it comes, nor whither it goes. Now if in these common matters men are so
blind, how much more in the deep judgments of the most High?

Verse 18. Have thou with him spread out the Sky?] He had convinced Job of his
ignorance, and now he will of his impotence and imbecility: and this by an
irony; q.d. Tune ille giga^es? Art thou indeed that Giant or Demi-god that
helped the Almighty when he spread the heavens, when he laid the foundation of
the earth, etc? Age itaque si tantus vir es, quantum te ostentas, etc. Go to
then, if thou be indeed such an one as thou would seem to be, whiles thou
take upon thee to be, viz. to contend with God, and to complain of his hard
dealing with thee, Teach us what we shall say unto him, etc. as ver. 19. for we
dare not, as thou have done, dare him to come into the lists with us, as hoping
to have the better of him.

Which is strong.] Not by reason of any hard massy Elemental thickness, but by
reason of their airy, Diod.
incorruptible, indissoluble nature, composed of very thin and even parts.
Hence the Greeks call it, (...), and the Latins Firmamentum. See the Note on
Genesis 1.7.

And as a molten Looking-glass] Perspicuum and sapphirinum, clear and
transparent as a mirror wherein God makes himself visible, R. Levi.
as it were; who, of himself is too subtle for sight or sinew to seize upon.
The Hebrew has it, which is strong as a molten Looking-glass; i.e. as a
polished brazen Looking-glass, being more solid then brass more transparent
then crystal.

Verse 19. Teach us what we shall say unto him] A notable scoff, a sharp
sarcasme. Verba sunt urgentis and insultantis; q d. Velim ut e tot argumentis,
cap. 23.4. aliqua nunc proferas, I would that thou would bring out some of
those many Arguments thou did brag of: for we are at a fault; neither can we
(such is our ignorance) find what to say in thy just defense, had we never so
good a mind to it.

For we cannot order our speech by reason of darknesse] We are benighted and
word-bound, forced to acknowledge our ignorance our infancy, and to complain,
(as Anaxagoras afterward did) omnia esse circumfusa tenebris; and (as
Empedacles) angust as esse sensuum semitas, that we are far to seek of what to
say in this case, and ready to think that silence would be our safest eloquence.

Verse 21. Shall it be told him that I speak] An in acta referetur ^i, si
loquar? Shall it be recorded before him, etc? q.d. Then woe be to me, for I am
sure to rue it, yea, and (without mercy) to be ruined for it. Did not Enoch the
seventh from Adam prophecy long since, saying, Behold the Lord comes to
execute judgment upon all, and to convince them of all their hard speeches
which ungodly sinners have spoken against him, Jude 14, 15.

If a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up] If he speak in thy behalf, or
after thine example, presuming to control Gods works, and to quarrel his
proceedings as thou have done, he is sure to be undone. Some read the words
thus, For if he speak man shall be devoured; That is, if God speak, man (who
before he comes to speak, thinks that he shall be able to reason with him)
shall be quite confounded, and his words, as it were, swallowed up by his
profound wisdom; and he made unable to speak one word for himself. Wherefore
let all f^^sh be silent before the Lord; for if any presume to chat against his
judgments, he shall have his words driven down his throat again by a divine
vengeance, Cave ne lingua feriat collum, Take heed thy tongue cut not thy
throat, say the Arabians Proverb-wise.

Verse 21. And now men see not the bright light that is in the clouds] It
seems says an Expositor, that at that very instant the cloudy weather, did
begin to clear up, and that thereupon Elihu took occasion to speak these words,
The Sun is called Light by an excellency: the Egyptians call him Orus, from the
Hebrew, Or.
q.d. Thou art not able to look into the body of the shining Sun, quia nimium
sensibile laedit sensum; How much less can thou behold God in his glory, in
comparison of whom, the Sun in his strength is but as a clod of clay? Hereafter
we shall see God as he is, see him face to face, 1 John 3. See as we are seen,
etc. but here we can see his back parts only and live, Exodus 33. Surely out of
what Elihu had hitherto said Job should have reasoned thus with himself, I
cannot bear the force of a flash of lightning, of a clan of thunder, of a
violent shower, of an overturning whirlwind of an extreme frost, of the
out-shining Sun, etc. how much less of God in his Majesty?

Verse 22. Fair weather comes out of the North] Heb. Gold comes, etc.
Serenitas aur similis. Tig.
that is, the golden beams of the Sun, as golden Oil, Zech. 4.12. The
North Wind also cleanses the clouds, and shows us the pleasant face of the
Sun, that Gold-maker; all whose rays come tipped and gilt with a glistering
glory upon them.

With God is terrible Majesty] Far beyond that of the Sun, or of the most dread
Sovereign upon earth: be it an Augustus Caesar, or a terrible Tamberlane, Turk.
hist. 23^ and 415.
in whose eyes sat such a rare and reverend Majesty; as a man could hardly
endure to behold them, without closing his own. The Tigurines render it, Ad
Deum reverendissimum pertinet confessia, To the most reverend God belongs
praise. Others by way of Doxology, Unto God be reverend Majesty; a fit perclose
of Elihu's excellent Discourse. It was the last speech of dying Chrysostom,
Glory be to God from all creatures. Let it be the badge of the Beast, Laus Deo,
and beatae Virgini. Cry we, Deus terribilis laudeter, as Brentius renders this
Text, Let God alone be praised.

Verse 23. Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out] Heb. The Almighty;
the Nominative Case put absolute; q.d. in short, as for the Almighty (that
nomen Majestativum, as Tertullian phraseth it) we cannot comprehend him, any
more then we can the main Ocean in a cockel shell. And whereas we can say, as
here, that he is excellent in Power, and in Judgment, and in plenty of
Justice, August.
Ista de Deo dicimus, quia non invenimus melius quod dicamus; We say these
things of God, because we have nothing better to say of him, and must owe the
rest unto our thoughts, although indeed, He is above all name, and above all
notion. In searching after God, says Chrysostom, I am like a man digging in a
deep Spring, I stand here, and the water rises upon me, and I stand there, and
still the water rises upon me. To Thomas Aquinas busy in this search, was
showed (they say) a deep pit in the edge of the sea, (which empty it, and carry
away the water as often as they will,) it is still filled with other. It is a
knowledge that passes knowledge, Ephesians. 3.19 That which in measure is pleasant
and profitable, being too much enquired into, proves unsavory and unsafe.

He will not afflict] viz. Willingly. Lam. 3.33. or canslesly, 1 Pet. 1.6. Or
He will not answer; viz. Every one that questioneth the justice of his
proceedings as Job in his heat had done. The Seventy render it question-wise,
will he not answer? scil. Those that call upon him in truth, since he is
excellent in power and in judgmen, etc? Sure he will.

Verse 24. Men do therefore fear him] They do, or should do, for his excellent
greatness and goodness, Psalm. 130.4. Matthew. 10.28. But in case they do not

He respects not any that are wise of heart] That out of a conceit of their
own wisdom stand it out against him, and think to reason it out with him, as
thou have done. Or, But he sees not all wise in heart: He finds not all
wise, whom he beholds here upon earth. Stultorum plena sunt omnia, and thou
also have dealt very foolishly, as God has seen and will shortly show thee
better then I can do.

CHAP. XXXVIII. Verse 1. Then the Lord answered Job.]
GOD himself taking the word out of Elihu's mouth, (who had spoken well, but
wanted Majesty to set it forth) became his own Patron, et hujus disputationis
sequester, and Decider of this long Controversy, vindicating his own
Authority, and teaching that truth in the four following Chapters, which Saint
Paul briefly comprizeth in these words, Romans 11.33, 34. O the depth of the
riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his
judgments, and his ways past finding out! For who has known the mind of the
Lord, or who has been his Counselor? Why then should any one require an
account of his proceedings, or question his Justice? Job had often desired that
God would take knowledge of his Cause. His friends also had desired the same,
chap. 11.5. Here therefore He appears in person, not as out of an Engine
devised for that purpose, after the manner of some partial Tragedy, for the
whole narration testifies, that this is a true story of things done indeed,
Beza.
and afterward faithfully recorded. Which history is highly to be esteemed as
an incomparable Treasure, if it were for nothing else, yet for the right
knowledge of natural Physophy here laid open, in these four following Chapters,
together with the chief and principal end thereof, which is, that in these
visible creatures, we may behold the invisible things of God.

Out of the whirle-wind] That is, Out of a cloud whence issued a whirlwind or
a storm, as a testimony of his heavenly Majesty, and to procure attention. See
the like Deuter. 4.12. 1 King, 19.11. etc. Ezekiel 1.4. etc. Nah. 1.3. Heb. 12.18.
God loves to be acquainted with men in the walks of their obedience, yet he
takes state upon him in his Ordinances, and will be trembled at in his word and
judgments.

And said] With much more mildness and moderation then Elihu or any of them had
used in reprehending Job, and yet with such plenty and efficacy of words and
arguments, Vt facillime omnes omnium orationes superet, That no such Oration
can any where else be read. Well might Lavater say, Hoc postramum colloquium
est admodum suave and utile, this conference of God with Job, is very sweet and
profitable; for it teaches us, among other things, how gently God deals with
his offending servants, and how hardly the best are brought to confess their
sins, and truly to repent of them.

Verse. 2. Who is this that darkneth counsel?] Who Is this that talks thus,
(says God, stepping forth, as it were from behind the hangings) how now?
What Is to do here? Some Ancients think it meant of Elihu; but Job is the man,
see chap. 42.3. where he takes it to himself; and it may be God here pointed to
him with a Quis est iste Job?

That darkneth counsel] My Counsel, by misconstructions, his own, by rash and
unskilful expressions: for which Elihu also rightly blamed him, and his other
friends took great offense at him; who should rather have said as Cruciger did
of Luther, Eum commodius sentire quam loquitur, dum effervescit, that he
thought not so ill, as he spoke in his heat.

By words without knowledge] This is the worst that God charge Job with;
words of folly and ignorance: not with malice, falsehood, blasphemy, etc.
Counsel also he attributes to him, though not wisely managed. If there be any
good in us, he notes and noticeth it; passing by our defects and failings: as
when Sarah called her husband Lord, she is much commended for it; though there
was never another good word in all that sentence, Genesis 18.12. 1 Pet. 3.6. See
on chap. 35. verse. 16.

Verse 3. Gird up now thy loins like a man] As men did use to do when they went
to fight, 1 King. 20.11. Stand to thy ward, and see to thy self: for I mean to
assail thee, and to try thy manhood. Plato has observed, that the best Fencers
are the worst Soldiers. Many can brave it aforehand, as that Thrasonical Gaal
did, Judge. 9.29. who yet cannot look their enemy in the face with blood in
their cheeks.

For I will demand of thee, and answer thou me] I will be thy opponent (since
thou have challenged me into the schools, as it were, and given me my choice)
and prove thee with hard questions; whereunto if thou can give no good
answer, see thine own folly, and be satisfied.

Verse 4. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?] q. d. Thou
wast no where, a mere Non-ens: thou wast no companion or counselor of mine;
nay, not so much as a looker on, for thou art but of yesterday. Thou
understandest not the reason of this fair fabric: much less of my dark and
deep counsels.

Declare if thou have understinding] Heb. If thou know understanding. An
irony, but friendly, and free from all bitterness; the better to convince Job
of his folly and faultiness: for which end also, multis eum interrogationibus
onerat, Mercer.
God loadeth him with many deep questions, the least whereof he could not
answer.

Verse 5. Who has laid the measures thereof] In that circumference and
diameter that it holds?

If thou knowest] Or, For thou know; quandoquidem scitus es, a tart irony.
Geometricians take upon them to know the several dimensions of the earth: and
Archimedes boasted, that if he had but where to set his foot from off the
earth, he could shake the whole body of it. As also, that he could number all
the sands that were in the whole World, habitable and inhabitable: But these
were vain brags.

Or who has stretched the line upon it?] A metaphor from Masons and other
Master Builders, who work by line and by rule. Vitruvius in his 7th. Book says
thus, Longitudines ad regulam and lineam, altitudines ad perpendiculum, anguli
ad normam responde^i^s exigantur.

Verse 6. Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?] Surely, upon
nothing, but the word of Gods power. The Philosophers dispute many things
concerning the foundations of the earth; but without any sound foundation of
good reason. Some Jew-Doctors make the mountains to be them: but these bear not
up the earth, but the contrary. The Psalmist says, that God has founded the
solid earth upon the liquid waters, Psalm. 24. wherein appears the infinite
wisdom and power of God the founder. Vitruvius says, In solido extruendum,
foundations must be laid in solid places. But God is not tied to rules: his
works are in oppositis mediis, as was above noted.

Or who said the cornerstone thereof?] i. e. The Center (say some Jew-Doctors)
whither all heavy things are carried, and about which the whole world hangs:
the elements and heavenly orbs surrounding it in their motions. Others fetch
this cornerstone out of the middle of the sea. But all this discourse is
metaphorical, to show the firmness of the work, wherein none had any hand but
only the essential wisdom of God, Prove. 8. who did it with more ease than men
can build an house.

Verse 7. When the morning stars sang together] There is but one morning star
properly so called, viz. Phosphorus, Lucifer, or Venus, the Suns forerunner.
But, for their brightness, they are all called here, Stars of the morning, and
said to sing together, as birds use to do at break of day: so did these in the
morning of the Creation, when first those heavenly torches began to shine, and
joyfully to dance, as it were, in number and measure. This they do still in
their kind, Psalm 19. verse. 1. beckening also, as it were, to us to do the
like, Psalm. 145.3.

And all the sons of God shouted for joy] i. e. All the Angels, as chap. 1.6.
meant also by those morning stars, as Piscator and others will have it. These
being created together with the highest heavens, on the first day (as it is
probable) like as Christ's soul was created in and with his body in the Virgins
womb the same moment) were present at a great part of the Creation, if not at
all: and were rapt with admiration at the great wisdom and power of their
Creator, singing, Holy, holy, holy, etc. Shall the stars sing, the Angels
shout, and shall we be so dull? This was all they did, at the Creation. Note
this against those, who held that God made the superior creatures himself, but
the inferior by his Angels. A great hand they have, as Gods instruments, in
governing the world, Ezekiel. 1.5, 6, 7, etc. (whence also they are called
Watchmen and Keepers, Dan. 4.13.) but not any had they in making the world: for
in that work, God was alone, and by himself, Isai. 44. verse. 24.

Verse 8. Or who shut up the sea with doors] i. e. With bounds and banks: the
Sea God shut up in the hollow parts of the earth, as in a great house, that the
dry land (naturally overwhelmed thereby) might appear, and become fit, both to
bear grain, grass, plants, etc. and to yield an habitation for men and beasts.
Piscator thinks it is a Metaphor from Floodgates at Mill-ponds.

When it brake forth as if it had issued out of the womb] The Sea is here set
forth in lively colors, as an incomprehensible work of Gods wisdom. Out of
Nothing God produced it at first, as an infant out of the mothers womb. How
great is God then, to whom the great Sea is but as a little infant? It brake
out of the womb, when it was severed from the Abyss; which lay covered with
darkness, till the waters below were separated from those above, Genesis 1.10.

Verse 9. When I made the cloud the garment thereof] When I clothed this new
born child with a cloud; Elegans allegovia. Jun.
commanding the vapors which environ it, to serve it for garments. Clouds are
begotten of the waters, of the sea especially, and appear daily upon it.

And thick darkness, a swaddling band for it] This thick darkness is well
interpreted to be those fogs and mists which arise upon the sea, and are
between the clouds and the sea; as the swaddling bands between the upper garment
and the child. Interim significat, says Mercer here; Meanwhile here is
signified, that God can as easily rule and repress the sea, as the mother, or
nurse, can her suckling, when it is swathed up.

Verse 10. And brake up for is my decreed place] That great house in the
hollows of the earth, verse. 8. gathering it together by a perpetual and
powerful decree, into that place and pit. Tremellius renders it, Quum diffregi
pro eo terram decreto mea; When I brake up for it the earth by my decree.
Others, And laid upon it my Statute: for shabhar signifies also statuere,
decernere, say they: but that is more than I know.

And set bars and doors] Vectes and valvas: See verse. 8. This is a work of Gods
great power: and is therefore much instanced and insisted upon in Scripture,
Ps. 109. Jer. 5.22, etc. God could have put many other hard questions to Job
about the sea^ as, why it swells not by the inflowing of so many great
Rivers? why the waters of it are so salt? whence it is that it so ebbeth and
flows, etc? Aristotle shows himself no very wise man in answering these
questions; whom yet Averr^es so madly admireth, that he says, there is no
error at all to be found in him; and that his doctrine is the chiefest truth,
etc.

Verse 11. And said, Hitherto shall thou come and no further] This God
commanded, and it is done. If the sea at any time break its bounds, and
overflow countries (as in Holland, Zealand, and other parts it has done) that
is to declare the power of God, and his just anger against sin.

And here shall thy proud waves be stayed] Canutus commanded such a thing: but
the sea regarded him not. Xerxes beat the sea, and cast a pair of fetters into
it to make it his prisoner, but to no purpose. God here chides it by an elegant
Eclipsis or Aposiopesis, Illic ponet (sc. ventus) elationem fluctuum tu^rum,
and it is quieted immediately, as Jon. 1. Matthew. 8. Think the same of the
waters of Afflictions.

Verse 12. Have thou commanded the morning, since thy days?] It may be thou will say, These are ancient things, done long before I was born: but ask me of
things within my reach, and remembrance. Well then, what say thou to the
Sunrising? Have thou either lengthened or hastened it at any time, since thou
were born, causing it to rise at such or such an hour, in such or such a point
of heaven according to the diverse degrees and situations of the Zodiak? No:
this is more than ever any man could do: The day is thine, the night also is
thine, says David, Thou have prepared the light and the Sun, Thou have set all
the borders of the earth, thou have made summer and winter, Psalm. 74.16, 17. If
all the Emperors and Potentates of the earth should conjoyn their forces to
hinder or hasten the rising of the Sun, they could never do it. Joshua did
indeed stop the course of the Sun: but that was by the power of God set a work
by his faithful prayer; Whence One cries out, O admirabilem piarum precum vim
ac potentiam, quibus etiam coelestia cedunt! O the admirable power of Prayer,
force of Faith, which is such as the visible heavens are sensible of, and
gives way to! how then should earth or hell stand before it?

And cause the dayspring to know his place] The word dayspring comes from
blackness; for it is not (...) clear light at first: but (...), Aurorasic a
nigrore dicta qui eam comitatur.
rather dark, than light.

Verse 13. That it might take hold of the ends of the earth] That is suddenly
illighten the whole Horizon: for which cause also David ascribes wings to the
morning, Psalm. 139. so that the light is not a body, nor (as some will have it)
a substance, but an accident. The truth is, no man can tell what it is, of any
certainty: an admirable creature it is, surely a divine and heavenly thing,
than which nothing is more desirable, nothing more profitable. Two excellent
uses of it are here set forth, 1. To refresh men by the sight of the earth, and
the things thereon. 2. To set us upon serious employments, such as is the
punishment of evil doers, for so some interpret those next words.

That the wicked might be shaken out of it] sc. By banishment, or rather by
death, inflicted upon them in the light, for their deeds of darkness. Or at
least, that those Lucifugae, tenebriones, those inauspicate night-birds, who
hate the light, because their works are evil, might be shamed and shunned.
Their Motto is, Jam lux inimica propinquat. See chap. 24. verse. Virg.
13, 17.

Verse 14. It is turned as clay to the seal] That is, The earth now discerned,
by reason of the air enlightened. The sense is this, Like as clay in the lump
that has no figure stamped upon it, is changed by a seal impressed, Piscator.
and receives the figure of the seal upon it self: so the earth, which by
night was without form by reason of darkness, when once the Sun is up, is
figured as it were: that is, it shows the several figures stamped upon it.

And they stand as a garment] All the several fruits, flowers, and various
workmanship of God in her produced creatures that grow thereupon, Abbot.
appear as a stately garment or ornament on a man, Mat. 6.28, 29. the Sunbeams
shining upon it as lace.

Verse 15. And from the wicked, their light is with-holden] They have no such
joy of those comforts which the light affords: but as it discovers their
dark practices, Ephesians. 5.13. so it b^ingeth them forth to condign punishment;
Vtpote indignos, qui hac luce fruantur.

And his high arm shall be broken] i. e. His strength, tyranny, and power,
whereby he oppressed others as with an outstretched arm lifted up to strike
with violence, this shall be broken, as Moabs was, Jer. 48. and as all the
wickeds shall be; but the Lord upholdeth the righteous, Psalm. 37.17. It is well
noted, that this verse is an Exposition of the latter part of verse. 13. as the
former verse was of the former part. And well might Mercer say of this, and the
three following Chapters, Sunt hac alta and insignia, and munulla difficilia;
these are things high, and excellent, and something dark, and difficult.

Verse 16. Have thou entered into the springs of the sea?] Heb. Into the tears
of the sea; Vsque ad ploratamaris. Job. 28.11.
for springs pour out water as eyes do tears: and the same Hebrew word
signifies an eye, and a spring; because, says One, the eye is of a watery
constitution: or to show, that from it, as from a spring or fountain, did flow
both sin it self, the cause of sin, and misery the punishment of both: and
because by it came the greatest hurt; therefore God has placed in it the
greatest tokens of sorrow: iisdem quibus videmus oculis, flemus. Now if Job
cannot fathom the Sea, much less can he the deep counsels of God.

Or have thou walked in the search of the deep?] Et in vado voraginis
ambulasti? No: that is Gods walk alone, Psalm. 77.19. whatever the Papists legend
of their St. Christopher.

Verse 17. Have the gates of Death been opened unto thee?] sc. That thou
should know when, how, and of what Disease every man shall die: together
with the state and condition of the dead.

Or have thou seen the doers of the shadow of death?] No, nor any man living
has ever seen those dark and dismal receptacles of the dead, called here, the
shadow of death; that is, so dreadful, that they were enough to strike a man
dead.

Verse 18. Have thou perceived the breadth of the earth?] Heb. The bredths, i.
e. the length also and circumference thereof. Geographers define the length of
the earth from East to West, the breadth from North to South; and they have
their supputations and conjectures. Frigidae sunt et leves conjecturae. Mercer.
Pencer, and others, tell us, that if there were a path made round the earth,
an able footman might easily go it in 900. days. Which if he could, yet what
mortal man, though he should live 900. years, could ever visit and view the
whole face, nature, and dimension of the earth, wherein are so many deserts and
bogs unpassable? Or, what Job can give a reason why God made the earth of such
a length and breadth, and no more, when he could so easily have done it? How
much less can he of Gods secret and unsearchable judgments? and why should he
so desire to know the cause wherefore he is Afflicted?

Declare if thou know it all] Since a great part of it is uninhabited: and
the sea surroundeth it as a girdle.

Verse 19. Diod.
Where is the way where light dwells?] These are Poetical terms likewise:
which signify, or mean nothing else, but that God alone without any help or
work of any man, appointed the diverse points of Sunrising, and Sunsetting.

And as for darkness, where is the place thereof?] i. e. Little can thou
tell what is become of it, or where the Sun sets: by the absence whereof
comes darkness. The truth is, our reason is by original sin so darkened, that
we understand not these lesser and common matters. Those that are more high and
hard we learn not, but with much labor, and long experience. As for the
Mysteries of God, and things pertaining to Salvation, we cannot at all attain
unto them by humane reason, as is to be seen in Nicodemus, Job 3. and 1. Cor. 2.

Verse 20. That thou should take it to the bound thereof] That thou
should take light and darkness by the hand as it were, and lead them to the
place of their abode.

And that thou should know the paths, etc.] That is, Which way to go to
bring them out of their retiring-rooms: and to reduce them into our Hemisphere.

Verse 21. Know thou it beacuse thou wast then born?] Beza reads it thus,
These things, forsooth, thou know, because thou wast then born ( viz. when I
made them, and appointed what order and course they should keep) and the number
of thy days is great, thou are uery far grown in years, as having lived ever
since the Creation. Es a^ nosissimus and antiquissimus, etc. Ironice omnia.

Verse 22. Have thou entered into the treasures of the snow?] i, e. Into the
clouds where these Meteors (whereof before chap. 37.) are engendered: and from
whence God, when he pleases, brings such great store, as if he had them
treasured up by him of a long season. See the like said of the winds, Psalm
135.7. Quasi parata haberet horum penuaria. Gregory allegorizing these words,
shows, that earthly treasures are treasures of Snow. We see little children
what pains they take to rake and scrape together snow to make a Snow-ball:
Right so, they that scrape together the Treasure of this world; have but a
snow-ball of it: so soon as the Sun shines, and God breaths upon it, and so
enters into it, by and by it comes to nothing.

Or have thou seen the treasures of hail?] Another Metaphor from Officers of
the Exchequer, or public Treasury; q.d. Have thou the inspection or
administration of these Meteors?

Verse 23. Which I have reserved against the time of trouble] Or, Against the
time of the enemy to punish him, as Exodus 9.24. Josh. 10.11. Isai. 30.30. By
deep Snowes men are sometimes withered and destroyed: by violent hailstones
and coals of fire (as Psalm. 18.13, 14, 15.) What an overthrow was procured
against the Quades by the prayers of the thundering Legion, as they were
afterward called in the days of Aurelius the Emperor? Ingens grando
compluraque fulmina in hosts ceciderunt; Dio in vit. etc. Ant. Phil.
Huge hailstones and many light-bolts fell upon the enemy says the Heathen
Historian.

Against the day of battle and war] When God is pleased to bring forth his
upper and lower troops ready pressed, as the Rabbis phrase it.

Verse 24. By what way is the light parted] scil. From the clouds by lightning,
or from darkness by the Sunrising? Know thou that? Or the cause of it?
Nothing less. Something Philosophers have to say here, but upon no great
certainty.

Which scatters the East wind upon the earth] Eurus est ventus urens
exiccans, the East wind has its name in Hebrew from the Sunrising; the
Latins call it, Ventum subsolanum, as that which usually follows the
rising-Sun, but whence it comes, and whither it goes, is more then Job or any
other can tell.

Verse 25. Who has divided (or derived) a water course for the overflowing of
waters?] That is, the water-clouds for the pouring out of rain, Velut per
canales and tubulos; as by Pipes and conveyances wheresoever God pleases, men
being amazed at those miracles of Nature, Is it not the Lord alone? He it is
who divides the Deluge of waters; as it were draining them into certain
furrows which would otherwise fall down from heaven all at once, and make
great spoil here below.

Or a way for the lightning of thunder] Nimbo sonoro, says Tremellius. See
chap 28.6. with the Note.

Verse 26. To cause it to rain on the earth where no man is] But wild beasts
only. These also are Gods Creatures and he provideth food for them. How much
more will he do so for us, though small faiths.

On the wilderness wherein there is no man] Repetitio ad varietatem and
elegantiam, as also to show the certainty of the thing.

Verse 27. To satisfy the desolate and waste ground] The waste and waste
ground says Broughton elegantly; and the Hebrew sounds alike.

And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth] For the use of wild
Creatures, whereof there are great store in the Desert of Arabia, not far
from Job; for the which, and the rest of his living Creatures, this great
Housekeeper of the world provideth food, suitable to their several appetites.

Verse 28 Has the rain a father?] Subandi, praeter me, faith Vatablus? Has it
any father but me? Can any of the Heathen Deities give rain? Or can the
Heavens give showers? Art not thou He, O Lord our God? Therefore we will wait
upon thee, for thou have made all these things, Jerem. 14.22.

Or who has begotten the drops of the dew?] Those round orient Pearls, that
falling from heaven in a clear night, do sweetly refresh whatsoever grows in
fields and Meadows. The natural causes hereof, and of rain are known, but we
must rise higher to God, the first Author and Father of these and other
things, before and after mentioned, who brings them out of his Treasuries,
and does wonderfully both make and manage them. It is remarkable that Christ
says, Hos. 14.5. I will be as the dew unto Israel, He shall grow as the Lilly,
etc. (See the Note on that Text) Christ is unto them as a cloud of dew in the
heat of harvest, Isai. 18.4. Making their hearts to be as so many watered
gardens, Jer. 31.12.

Verse 29. Out of whose womb came the ice?] Indeed of ice and water is said in
a sense, Matter me genuit: eadem mox gignitur ex me. But these creatures are not
produced by causes which are constant and invariable in Nature, as humane
generation is, but they proceed from Gods pure and simple free will.

And the hoary frost of heaven, who has gendred it?] Out of the heaven; that
is, Out of the lower Region of the Air comes the matter of it, but God makes
it. Naturalists say, that the hoar frost is a vapor congealed by a cold wind
in cold places of the lower Region of the Air; as in Winter we see the breath
that comes out of the mouth, to congeal and hang upon the beard and hairs.
This hoare frost is answerable in the counter-point to the dew, but lasts
much longer.

Verse 30. Quae aquae magno and diuturno frigore congelascunt, velut per 10 vel
20 annos continuos appeilantur chrystallus, velut in Alpibus. -- Et glacialem
Oceanum --
The waters are hid at with a stone] This is a further description of ice,
which is hard as a stone, and clear as crystal; so great is the force of
frost, how much more then of God to do whatsoever he pleases.

And the face of the deep is frozen] Some deep Rivers are ice to the bottom, so
that laden car^s are driven over, fires made upon them, meat dressed, etc. as
was here upon the Thames in the great Erost, some forty five years since. Yea,
some seas are over-frozen ( Juvenal speaks of the icy Ocean) in the Northern
part of the world, the ice thereof when once thawed, floteth in the waters like
huge mountains, as in Greenland, etc.

Verse 31 Can thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades?] That is,
Restrain the pleasantness of the Spring, or assuage the sharpness of winter,
that cold and comfortless Quarter? There is none beside God, who can either
forbid flowers to break forth in the Spring tide, Averni temporis significatione
or else cause them to flourish in winter. The Pleiades (otherwise called
Virgiliae and the Hens) are the seven Stars in the end of Aries. They are in
Hebrew called, Chimah, of Chamah to love ardently, because of the fellowship
and working together that appears in them. They have all one name, because
they all help one another in the work, which is, to bring the Spring; and like
seven Sisters or Lovers, so are they joined together in one Constellation, and
in one company. We see (says One) that God will have the sweetest works in
Nature to be perfected by mutual help. The best time of the year comes with
these Pleiades, and the best time of our life comes, when we enter into true
love and fellowship:

Or lose the bands of Orion?] Which is a Star that arises in the beginning of
Winter, Nimbosus Orion. Virg. (...) turbare and concitare.
and draws foul weather after him as with bands: these can no man ^^^e, for
Winter never rotteth in the Air (as the Proverb has it) nor is it fit it
should, for it is of very great use for mellowing of the earth, killing of
worms and (...), etc. Neither can the Spring come kindly, till Orion have
prepared the way. God will have us suffer, before we reign. The word Chesil
here used, sig^^^ (...) the (...) to perfect; because (says One) by suffering
and offering violence to our selves, we enter into perfection, Luke 13, 32. If
we would have a pleasant Spring of graces in our hearts, we must first have a
nipping winter. The Spirit of Mortification must be like the cold Star Orion,
to nip our quick motions in the head, and to bind all our unclean desires and
burning lusts, that they stir not in us; and unless we do thus the delights of
Pleiades, or the seven Stars of comfort shall never appear to us.

Verse 32 Can thou bring forth Mazzaroth?] Or, the Twelve Signs; or the
Southern Stars that bring in Summer. Lucifer some render it; others, the Hyades
and others again every one of the stars or signs. It is like it was some one
star very well known in those days, as were likewise the rest here mentioned,
and put for the four seasons of the year.

Or can thou guide Arcturus with his sons] Or, Boots with his waine, (those
Northern stars) or, Autumn with his yearly fruits, the gift and work of God
alone Of Arcturus, Hierome observes, that semper versatur nunquam mergitur;
this is most true of Christ's Church much tossed, never drowned.

Verse 33. Kn^west thou the Ordinances of heaven?] Either how to order them, as
Master over them, Diod.
or to comprehend what they are certainly and perfectly

Can thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?] As well in regard of the
motion of the heavens, which varieth the seasons of the year, as of the
influences and virtue which comes from thence. For they who think that the
superior bodies have no power at all upon these inferior, do go against common
sense and experience, yea, this and many other texts of Scriptures; which yet
make nothing at all for that Judiciary Astrology so much cried up, in these
last and worst days of the world, by some who would have the manners, studies
and events of every man to depend upon the stars, yea, the rise and ruin of
Kingdoms, Arts, Religion, etc.

Verse 34 Can thou lift up thy voice to the clouds?] Thy commanding voice, as
Numb. 9 23. Some render it, Thy thunder. Will the clouds obey thee, and rain
upon thee at thy pleasure? Something thou may get by thy prayers as Elias
did, James 5 17. and the thundering Legion in the Ecclesiastical history, but
nothing by command or compulsion. The Monarch of Mexico is a mad man to take an
Oath at his Coronation, Lopez de Gomara.
that it shall be what weather soever he pleases all the time of his Reign.

Verse 35 Can thou send lightnings?] Nunquid emittes. Can thou send forth
lightnings and thunderbolts, as hurtful Creatures out of the Cave wherein they
are kept? Or as so many soldiers or servants to do as thou command them?
The Poets feign that Mercury had once a mind to steal Jupiters thunderbolts,
but durst not lest they should burn his fingers. Histories tell us of a King of
Egypt, and of Caligula the Roman Emperor, that they attempttd to thunder and
lighten, Admirari duntaxat potest, efficere non potest. Brent.
but with very ill success. Job is here told, that that is too hard a work for
any creature to do.

Verse 36. Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?] Hitherto God has set
forth his own admirable Power, Wisdom and providence in making and governing
the life-less creatures the Meteors especially. Now he comes to declare the
same in things endued with life; and first with man his Masterpiece: who has
given him wisdom (says God) in the inward parts, or reins? where the
reasonable soul sits and soveraigneth. The Hebrews say, That the heart
understands, and the raines deliberate. They have their name here from
plaistering over, or covering; because they are over-covered with fat and
flesh; howbeit the Lord tries them, Jer. 17.10. and has given wisdom to man
to moderate his affections and concupiscences which are here seated, and to get
truth into these inward parts, Psalm 51.6. that this hidden man of the heart
may be highly accepted in heaven, 1 Pet. 3.4.

Or who has given understanding to the heart?] To the Cock, says the Vulgar
Latin, after the Talmudists and Jew-Doctors, who teach their Disciples
whenever they hear the Cock crow by night, to say this Benediction, The Lord
be praised, who gives understanding to the Cock; scil. to awaken men, and to
announce day. The Septuagint render it, Who has given to women skill to weave,
and art to embroyder? But they do best that take the word (though found only in
this place) for the Heart, Men's quasi imaginatrix and figuratrix dicta quod
omnia pervide^t and cognoscat.
as that wherein are painted and imprinted the imaginations and representations
of things, as the word seems to import.

Verse 37. Who can number the clouds in wisdom?] Quis sapphirinas efficit
nubes? Who can make the clouds like Sapphire, that is bright and clear? so some
read it. Others, Who can declare the clouds? scil. their number, nature and
uses?

Or who can stay the bottle of heaven?] i.e. the clouds, fitly compared to
bottle^, as those vessels that hold the rain, and power it out on the earth,
when God pleases to turn the mouths of those bottles downward. This is a great
Miracle, says Lavater, that whereas water is fluid, and bears downward, yet
it abides in the lofty and soft air, nor can fall, but where and when God
appoints.

Verse 38 When the dust grows into hardness, etc.] When the ground has had
its fill, so that the light dust is turned into lumps of earth: and that which
was tossed with every wind, is clodded and agglutinated by water into an heavy
substance. Hic enim simplex est and nativus hujus loci sensus, says Merlin.
Danaeus discoursing of stones, Physic. Christ. l. 2. c. 31.
how they are made of earth, says, That this Text is a compendium of all the
large Discourses of the natural Philosophers concerning that Subject.

Verse 39. Will thou hunt the prey for the Lion?] Heb. For the old Lion, (as
Neh. 2.9.) that cannot hunt for himself. Plin. and Aristot. scribunt, Leones
multa solida fine dissectu devorare.
Prey he must have, as being a very ravenous creature: but will thou provide it
him? With what great charge do Princes maintain a few Lions? But God
maintains all, and all other creatures, Psalm. 104.27, 28. and 145.15. putting
it into the young Lions, to provide prey for the old; and causing these
creatures to keep for most part in the Deserts, where they feed upon Camels,
and such as they can light upon. Ammianus Marcellinus writes, That in Chaldaea
there are an huge number of Lions, which were like enough to devour up both men
and beasts throughout the Country. But withal he says, That by reason of the
store of water and mud thereof, there breed yearly an innumerable company of
Gnats, whose property is to fly into the eye of the Lion, as being a bright
and Orient thing, where biting and stinging the Lion, he teareth so fie^cely
with his claws, that he puts out his own eyes: and by that means many are
drowned in the Rivers, others starve for want of prey, and many the more easily
killed by the Inhabitants.

Or fill the appetite of the young Lion?] Which is very greedy and insatiate.
Some render it, Catervam, the Troop or company of young Lions. But God in mercy
to mankind has so disposed it, that as devouring Creatures are more rare (the
Lioness seldom brings ^orth more then one in all her life) so they go not
often by troops, but range alone seeking their prey.

Verse 40. When they couch in their dens, etc.] When both by might and slight
they provide for themselves. Hunters with all their pains and means cannot
catch a beast so soon as the Lion can. An Ape he hates in a special manner, as
being too crafty for him: And yet he fears man (although as the Poet says,
Simia quam similis turpissima bestia nobis.) Ennius.
Whereof no other probable reason can be given, but the small remnant of Gods
Image left as yet in man, who once had dominion over all the Creatures, and is
still fearred by the fiercest of them.

And abide in the covert to lie in wait] Where they crouch, counterfeit
themselves asleep, lie quiet and close, as Cats that would catch Mice, or Foxes
birds. But if this way they speed not, Basil says they set up a loud roar,
whereby the Beasts are so amated, that they have no power to stir out of the
place they stand in, till the Lions have taken them.

Verse 41 Who provideth for the Raven his food?] Though the Raven be a most
vile creature, and hated almost of all: in some places there is a reward
appointed for those that shall kill them up. Though an unclean creature, and
therefore abominable, Lev. 11.13, 15. Though unmerciful to her own, and
pitilesse to other birds, though an inauspicate creature, a sign both of man's
punishment, and Gods curse, Isai. 34 11. Though he cries with a hoarse and
harsh voice (whence also he has his name in the Original) and so unfit to move
pity; yet God provideth food for him: What then will he do for his faithful
servants, Matthew. 6.26? Where our Savior fetches not an example from the
Israelites miraculously fed in the wilderness, or Elias in the Desert, but
from Fowls of the Air; and among them, Corvus incuba 20 diebus and pullos
nido expellit. Plin. Aris^ Arist. hist. Animal. l 9. c. 31.
not from Eagles, Hawks, Nightingales, but Ravens, etc. Consider the Ravens,
Luke 12.24.

When his young ones cry to God] Though by implication only they cry, and not
directly, being forsaken by the old ones, and left bare, they are fed by God
with flies and worms bred in the nest out of their excrements; till able to
fly, and leave the nest, they wander for lack of meat to take it wherever
they can meet with it.

CHAP. XXXIX. Verse 1. Know thou the time when the wild Goats of the Rock
bring forth?]
THe History of the living Creatures is of singular use we see to set forth the
Goodness, Power, Wisdom, and other of Gods Attributes clearly shining in them.
And therefore they have very well deserved of all sorts who have put forth such
Histories and discourses; as Aristotle, Elian, Pliny, G^sner, Aldobrandinus,
etc. of whom I may say, as once E^tus Sylvius (afterward Pope Pius 2) did of
Learning in general, That Popular men should esteem them as silver, Noblemen as
Gold, Princes as Pearls; and not so slenderly reward them, Joh. Manl. loc.
com. 572.
as Pope Sixtus did Theodorus Gaza (who translated, and dedicated unto him,
Aristotle, De Natura Animalium) paying him only for the rich Binding and
Bossing forty Crowns: but bountifully encourage them, as Great Alexander did
his Master Aristotle for that same Work; he gave him says the History, eight
hundred Talents, which is four hundred and four score thousand Crowns. The
pleasure of reading such Authors, is not so great as the profit; for thereby we
may attain to the knowledge of God and of our selves; of his Will, and our
Duties. Hence we are sent to School to the unreasonable Creatures, even the
most contemptible, as the Pismire, Prove. 6.6. And Basil writing to one, that
was proud of his knowledge, propounds unto him diverse questions concerning
this same Pismire, as namely, how many feet he has? whether he has entrails,
as kidneyes, liver, heart, veins, nerves, as other living Creatures, etc?
Semblably, God here to humble Job, and to convince him of his meanness, asks
him, whether he knows the wild Goats and Hinds, with the time of their
bringing forth young, the means and the manner, etc? And whether these things
were done by his ordination and vigilance? Many admirable things are written of
these wild Goats; as what cold places they live in, what inaccessible Rocks,
Pendemem summa capream de rupe videbis casuram sp^res, decipit illa canes Mart.
how strangely there they hang, what huge leaps they fetch; but especially
about their bringing forth, how by a natural sagacity they help themselves,
both before and after, by biting upon certain herbs that are helpful to them in
that case. These things, and many more such may be read of in Pliny's Natural
History; of which Book Erasmus well says, That it is a storehouse, or rather
a world full of things most worthy to be read. So are not the Jewish
Expositors, who tell us many strange things here concerning these Creatures,
quae commentitia esse put^, which I take to be mere Fictions, says Learned
Mercer. And I, to be trifles, and old wives Fables, says Lavater. To the
belief whereof they are justly given up by God for their rejecting of Christ
the Light of the world. We grant that the whole world is full of miracles,
though for the commonness of them they are little noted, or noticed. But should
these men think to help the truth by their lies? Should they speak wickedly for
God, and talk deceitfully for him?

Or can thou mark when the Hinds do calve?] Which they do not, without a
great deal of pain, (as the Hebrew word imports) no creature the like,
unless it be woman. God sometimes frighteth them by his thunder, and so
furthereth their delivery, Psalm. 29.9. whilst they struggle with many griefs,
and to give life to their calves, are in danger of losing their own. Now, if
God help the Hinds in this case, will he be wanting to his laboring daughters?
Let them send for Lady Faith to be their Midwife; and all shall go well. She
has delivered Graves of their dead, Heb. 11.35 How much more then will she,
them of their quick births, yea, though they carry death in their bowels?

Verse 2. Can thou number the months they fulfill?] Eight months Aristotle
says (the Elephant is said to go above eight years) but who can tell the
instant when? or why not sooner, or later? Do thou exactly observe and count
those months as I do, to a moment? Sola hic Dei providentia elucet.

Verse 3. They bow themselves] sc. By an instinct of nature, whether it be the
pain they suffer which compels them to it, or the fear of hurting their
calves, which obliges them to it.

They bring forth their young] Diffindunt: fissa sc: et aperta tandem matrice;
they bring forth with a great deal of difficulty, to the crushing of their
young, which yet escape and grow up. Let good women learn, sperare a Deo
faciles and salices partus, to trust in God for a happy delivery, though it go
hard with them, sometimes to the making of some Medae^ say, Eurip.
Millies in acie mori mallem quam semel parere. I had rather, a thousand times,
die in battle, than bring forth one child.

They cast out their sorrows] Tormina, their throws, and therewith their young,
by the benefit of the herbs Arus and Seselis, Arist. hist. anim. lib. 9 cap. 5.
Plin. lib. 8. c. 31.
which they feed upon, for the better bringing away of their gleanings as they
call the involucrum, that wrappeth the young in the matrix. The vulgar has it,
They utter roarings; they cast forth cries which are as terrible as the
roarings of Lionesses. Stato partus tempore valve deh^sount que a partu mox
occluduntur: id quod fieri vidensus, inquit Galenus, fed quomodo fiat, admirari
tantum possumus. Avicenna vocat opus supra mirabilia omnia, mirabile. Sed
miracula assiduitate vilescunt. If a man should be born but once in an hundred
years, all the world would stand amazed at such a Miracle.

Verse 4. Their young ones are in good liking] Or, They recover; revalescunt as
Isai. (...) Sept.
58.16. notwithstanding the hardness of their birth, by reason of their dams
exceeding dry temperature, Psalm. 42.1. As the Hind brayeth after the
Waterbrooks, as being naturally hot, and dry when in pain especially; and this
the young are sensible of in their coming into the world, which yet they soon
recover and grow slick and fat. Let God be trusted for the welfare of our
children, though weak, and wearish when newborn, and hard put to it in the
birth.

They grow up with Corn.] Or, In the Field; after that they have been nourished
a while with their dams-milk, they forage for themselves, being calved about
Autumn, as Aristotle notes, that is in Seed-time: others say, about Harvest,
when corn is in the field, and Gods great^harn door open, as the proverb is.
This is here brought as an Argument of the divine providence.

They go forth, and return not unto them] That is, To their dams; as finding
food enough abroad. Thus other creatures, so soon as born almost, can shift for
themselves; only poor shift-lesse man is long ere he can do any thing, or comes
to any proof, to be able to provide for himself.

Verse 5. Who has sent out the wild-Asse free?] (...) Phere, serum animal, (so
Tremellius renders it) the wild Creature. And it is not unlikely that the
Latin word Fera, Eo quod onager feritate antecellit. Piscat.
comes from this Hebrew word for a wild-Asse; which is a most untameable, and
untractable creature. Every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and
of things in the sea is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind, Jam 3.7. We read
of Augustus Caesar that he had a tame Tiger, but who ever board of a wild-Asse
tamed? Africa is said to have whole herds of them: and it is reported, that
when they see a man, they stand stock still; and kick with their hinder feet,
braying aloud. And when the Hunter comes so near them, that he could touch them
almost, they snuff up the wind, kick up their heels, and run quite away: so
nimble they are, that they can hardly be taken, much less tamed? To the Colt
of this wild Creature, is a natural man compared by Zophar, chap. 11.12. for
his extreme rudeness and unrulinesse: The Prophet Jeremy has the like of the
Idolaters of his time, chap. 2.24. who were lawless and lewd Losels,
obstinate, and refractary; such as multo facilius fregeris quam flexeris; will
sooner break than bend: with these froward God will wrestle, Psalm. 18.26. with
these Antipodes God will walk contrary, Levit. 26.41. and be as cross as they
are, for the hearts of them. His Law has four teeth to taw and tame these
masterlesse Monsters; viz. 1. Irritation, Romans 7.7. 2. Induration, Isai. 6.10.
3. Obsignation, Genesis 4.7. 4. Execration, Deuteronomy. 28.16, 17, etc. Obeyed he will
be of them, either Actively or passively: and sanctified he will be, either by
them, or upon them, Levit. 10.3. Wild Asses are free from men: but so are not
wild Ismaelites from God. Who has ever loosed the bands of the wild Ass? but
God will hamper his rebels, and certainly subdue them; all his foes shall
become his footstool. Be instructed therefore, O Jerusalem, Jer. 6.8. Be not
as Horse and Mule that have no understanding, etc. for many sorrows shall be to
such wicked, Psalm. 32.9, 10. and it is too (...) for them to kick against the
pricks, Acts, 9.5. to push back upon the goad, as ^^^^med Heifers use to do,
but to their further sorrow, and sufferance.

Verse 6. Whose house I have made the wilderness] That of Arabia especially
near unto Job. where were whole droves of these wild Asses. There are a sort of
them also in Plara, one of the Islands of the Egean sea. Hermites and Anchorites
seem to affect the same liberty: but where did God ever grant it them? Man is
(...) says Aristotle, Natures good fellow, as One englisheth him: and no
sooner had the Philippians received the Gospel, but they were in fellowship to
a day, Phil. 1.5. The Communion of Saints is as well a point of Christian
practice, ^an Article of Christian belief: and they have much to answer for,
who sty up themselves, and forsake the assembling of our selves together, as
the manner of some is, Heb. 10. these are in the ready way to utter Apostasy,
Ibid. He is not like to walk long, who affects to walk alone. Two are better
than one; and why, see Eccles. 4.9, 11, 12. with the Notes.

And the barren land his dwelling] Heb. The salt place, that is, barren as if
it had been sowed with salt, Judge. 9.45. Psalm. 107.33, 34. Salt is taken in
Scripture to be both a cause and sign of barrenness, Deuteronomy. 20.23. Zeph. 2.9.
though amongst us there are some kind of soyles, they say, that are manured
with salt, and thereby made fruitful: but in those hot and dry Countries it was
otherwise. In these barren places, God provideth for the wild-Asse: and
although he has there but mean food, yet he is lusty and nimble, and saves
himself both from the Hunter, and from the ravage of other fierce and savage
creatures, by his strength and swiftness. Xenophon tells us, That Cyrus
passing through the wilderness of Arabia, with his Horsemen, there were many
of these wild-Asses: who, being stirred, ran so swiftly away, that some
horsemen following could not come near them; then standing still: Cyropad.
lib. 3.
but when the horsemen approached, they fell again a running as before, thus
deluding them. Haec igitur bestia non mediocre mirabilis Dei potentiae
vestigium est. says Brentius. In this beast therefore there is much of Gods
great power and providence to be seen. And from hence also we may gather, says
another Interpreter, that a little is enough to sustain men in the wilderness
of this world: As the Children of Israel also were here sustained, having
nothing to eat but what God sent them down from heaven from day to day, forty
years together. Nature is content with a little, grace with less.

Verse 7. He scorneth the multitude of the City] Heb. He laugheth. Insignis
Metaphora. He would scorn to be set to work, as the tame Ass is. Asinum
oneramus and non curat, quia asinus est, says Bernard, We load the Ass, and
he takes it well aworth; because he is an Ass. But the wild-Asse will not
take so: he is not a beast born to bear burdens as the other. He is not tardum
and pigrum animal; as the other, a dull and slow creature: for which cause
also, says Bellarmine; God would none of him, Exodus 13.13. and 34.20. Christ
so far hates dullness, that he bad Judas the traitor, what he did, do
quickly. The wild-Asse is very swift, and fed by Gods providence in the
wilderness; scorning the multitude, or the hurry-noise of the City.

Neither regards he the crying of the driver] Heb. Of the Exactour, who
rateth and rages against the tame Ass with words and blows, to hasten him to
his work, and to bring him this way, and that way. Oppressive Princes do the
like to their poor subjects, (the King of France is called, Rex asinorum) which
sometimes makes them turn wild, Joseph. l. 18. c. 2.
and shake off subjection; as the Jews did that to the Romans, choosing rather
to suffer the most exquisite torments, than to be enslaved. But what a mad
conceit was that of Martin Stembach, a Dutch Sectary, Anno 1566. who would
needs correct the Lords Prayer, Stultam and inefficacem asserens orationem in
qua interjectione o uteremur: non secus enim hac exclamandi formula divinam
gratiam impediri, Lonicer. ex Theatro vitae.
quam asinarii, asinorum impetum hoc adverbio?

Verse 8. The range of the mountains is his pasture] There he keeps, probably,
for fear of Lions, and other fierce creatures: and there he finds food and
forage, such as does not only appease his hunger, but excite his appetite; as
if he were in some fat pasture.

And he searches out every green thing] Speeding better in his search than
those Asses of Hetruria, which feeding upon green Hemlock, are thereby laid for
dead for three days, till half hileded by the Country men, who take them for
dead, they start up, and with an horrible noise run away in that pickle.

Verse 9. Naricornis.
Will the Unicorn be willing to serve thee?] The Rhinoceros, says the Vulgar:
but that is another kind of beast, so called from the growing of his horn from
his nose. This is the Monoceros or Unicorn, which cannot be taken alive (
interimi potest, capi non potest) as the Rhinoceros may. A very fierce and
strong creature it is, and now adays very rare, but anciently more common: He
has one horn only (and not many, as R. Levi by a mistake would infer from
Deuteronomy. 33.17.) that grows in the middle of his forehead; and that he lifted
up on high: whence also he has his name in the Hebrew. He is described in
Scripture, 1. By this high lifting up of his horn, Lib. 8. cap. 21.
Psalm. 92.10. 2. By his strength, Numb. 23.22. 3. From his untameable
fierceness, here. Pliny calls him a Lic^rn. Vertomannus says he saw two of
them. Scaliger says he had seen the horn of an Unicorn, a special Antidote
against Poison. Keckerm.
But some deny that there is any such creature: because if he had an horn so
placed, and of such a length as is affirmed, he could not graze: and besides it
appears not certainly, Ael. lib.
that ever any man saw such a creature. Aelian says that there are a sort of
wild-Asses in India of the bigness of an horse, that have one horn in the
midst of their foreheads in length a cubit and an half: and so sharp, that
therewith he pierces through the hardest things. Some conceive that by the
beast here mentioned is meant the wild-Bull, here oppossed to the tame Ox, and
elsewhere joined to Oxen, Deuteronomy. 33.17. Isai. 34.6. Whatever it is, it will not
be brought to do man service; though fitted by stature and strength to do much;
but lives at liberty, and is provided for by God.

Or abide by the crib] Heb. Ly all night there as Oxen do, ready for service
next morning? I trow not.

Verse 10. Can thou bind the Unicorn, etc?] To keep him in order, and to hold
him hard to his work, that he may lay the furrows even? Can thou tether or
geere him like a horse? Or will he be brought to drive or lead a Plow or
Harrow? No such matter. August.
Before the Fall, all Creatures would gladly have served man. Sed rebellis
facta est, quia homo numini, creatura homini.

Verse 11. Will thou trust him because his strength is great?] Of the Unicorns
strength Balaam speaks, Numb. 23.22. the Hebrew word signifies such
lustiness, courage, and prowess, as whereby one endures labor without
weariness or fainting. Such strength is required in plowmen, whose work is
never at an end: and hard fallow must have a strong team. But the Unicorn will
never fadge, nor frame to such an employment. Free God has made him: and
rather than part with his freedom, he will par^with his life. Let men learn to
stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made them free. (Gal. 5.1.) and
not he again entangled (as Oxen tied to the yoke) with the yoke of spiritual
bondage, worse than the Egyptian servicade.

Verse 12. will thou believe him that he will bring home thy seed?] That is,
the crop that comes of thy seed: as in the former verse, thy labor that is the
fruit of thy labor, as Psalm. 128.2. There is no trusting to this wild and
fierce creature to do any such thing. Vertoman says, that he saw two Unicorns,
and that they were not of so fierce a nature, but that they might be brought to
somewhat. But then they were not true Unicorns, say we: such as God here
describes.

And gather it into thy barn?] No trusting to the Unicorns gentleness for any
such matter, unless we desire to be deceived.

Verse 13. Gave thou the goodly wings unto the Peacock?] Alam exultandam, the
wings and tail to the Peacock, wherein he so prideth himself and takes such
pleasure, being all in changeable colors, so are some great promisers; (the
Peacock here has his name from his loud and shrill voice) as often changed as
moved. A beautiful bird it is, and pre^iously clothed by God. They were wont to
say here, Plin. l. 1^. c. 2^.
That Peacocks, Hops, and Heresy, came first into England in one and the same
ship. They say, he most of all spreads his fair tail, when he is most beheld by
men, and praised. His feathers are good for little else but only to please
children. But that he pulls down his fair plumes, and sets up his harsh
Note, when he looks down upon his ill-favored feet, is an old said saw; let
them believe it that list.

Or wings and feathers unto the Ostrich?] And so by a Synecdoche, to all other
fowls of the air: in the admirable variety of whose colors, tunes, and
tastes, 1 Cor. 15.39. much of Gods power, and wisdom, yea, of his goodness
also may be seen: and therefore the loss of these creatures (good for food,
for physic, and for delight, as the companions of our lives) is threatened as a
judgment, Jer. 4.25. and 9.10. Some for the Ostrich render the Stork, and some
a Night-bird of an ill note: But the following description agrees best with
the Bustard or Ostrich, which is between a beast and a foul; having so thin
feathers, and so heavy a body, that he cannot fly; but only lifts up his
wings, and runs very swiftly. Elian says that he is almost as big as a
Camel, being therefore called Struthi^-camelus. Pliny says that he is higher
than an horseman on horseback, and can outrun him: but is so foolish, that
being pursued, if he can hide his head only in some hole, or thicker, and can
see no body; he thinks himself safe, and that no body sees him; Cum interim
tot^ corporis mo^e promineas.
though his great bulk be all in sight. Other effects of his folly, follow in
the next words.

Verse 14. Which leaves her eggs in the earth] Some say that she lays 80.
eggs, and having a faculty of discerning which of them will prove Ostriches,
and which will come to nothing; she leaves some of them upon the sand, and
upon other some sits, and hatcheth them. But this appears to be a fiction,
because another and a better reason of her leaving her eggs is here alleged:
and the power and providence of God giving them life by the heat of the Sun,
evidenced, and evinced.

And warmeth them in the dust] Julius Scaliger reports the like of a certain
crested bird of the bigness of an hen, found in Catigan an Island in the sea
Sur; which sits not upon her eggs, but burieth them two foot deep in the
sand: whence they are hatched by the Sun and hot sands: and this, say some, in
very hot Countries is not unusual.

Verse 15. And forgets that the foot may crush them, or, that the wild beast
may break them] This brutish and blockish bird forgets, that is, she never
considers what may befall her eggs, left so carelessly. Other foul set their
Nests aloft and out of harms-way: not so this foolish and careless creature,
who has neither affection to preserve them, nor fear to lose them.

Verse 16. She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not
hers] Heb. Her sons: So are those peremptores potius quam parents, as Bernard
calls them, rather Parricides than Parents, who look not to the precious
souls of their poor children; who labor not to mend that by education, which
they have marred by propagation. These are worse than those daughters of
Jerusalem, who slain almost with grief and hunger, became cruel to their
sucklings, like the Ostriches of the wilderness, Lam. 4.3. What a cruel Mother
was Medea? and the Mother of King Edward the Martyr, whom she basely murdered:
And when his brother Egelrod; (who succeeded him in the Kingdom) being then
but ten years old, mourned thereat; Mr. Clarke Martyrol. fol. 31.
his mother was so enraged, that taking Wax candles, which were readiest at
hand, she therewith scourged him so sore, that he could never after endure Wax
candles to be burnt before him? But this cruelty was nothing to that of
soulmurder, whereof many parents by their negligence at least, are deeply
guilty: they bring forth children to that old Manslayer, Struthionis astorgia
declaratur e causis duabus, vacuitate metus and vacuitate intellectus.
and so their labor (in bearing and breeding children) is in vain, and worse,
without fear, for they will not be better advised nor affected.

Verse 17. Because God has deprived her of wisdom.] That is of such forecast
to provide for her young ones by a natural instinct, as other fowls and beasts
have. Gods mercy to men appears, 1. in giving us wisdom beyond them, Job
35.11. 2. In giving us power over them, Psalm. 8. And 3. In learning us so much
by them in those many Scripture-comparisons, Prove. 7.23. and 26.2. and 27.8.
Matthew. 8.26 that is a sweet place, Isai. 31.5. As birds flying. ( scil. to save
their young) so will the Lord defend Jerusalem; defending also, he will deliver
it; and passing over, he will preserve it. The Fowls of the Air are, and may
be unto us examples and Monitours of many virtues to be embraced, and vices to
be eschued. In the Ostrich, for instance, we may see that strength and bigness
of body is not always accompanied with wisdom and understanding: that it is
God who either gives or denies wisdom to his Creatures; that natural
affection is of him; that he gives not all things to one man, but diversely
distributeth his gifts: The Ostrich has wings, but not to fly with, etc.

(...).
(...). -- Non omnia possumus omnes.
Verse 18. What time she lifts up her self on high, etc.] That is, when she
runs away from the hunter (which she does with singular swiftness) she
lifts up her self on high, not from the earth, as other birds (for that she
cannot do) but on the earth, with wings stretched out like sails, and her whole
body bolt upright, scarce touching the earth at all with her feet, but
quickening her own pace with sharp spurs, which they say she has in the pinnion
of each wing, so pricking her self on, that she may run the faster; to teach us
what we should do in the race of Religion, and when pursued by Satan, how to
hasten to Christ.

She scorneth the horse and his rider] That is, she easily out-runs them, being
as swift as a bird that flies. They say, the Arabians are wont to try their
horses swiftness by trying to overtake them.

Verse 19. Have thou given the horse strength?] Having mentioned the horse, he
comes next to show his nature: and here we have a most elegant description of a
generous horse, such as Dubartas makes Cain to manage, and as the Greeks call,
(...), Fremebundum. Virg. Georg.
-- Quod siqua sonum procul armadeaere
Stare loco nescit, micat auribus, and tremit artus:
Collectumque premens velvit sub naribus ignem.


In this Creature therefore we have a clear instance of the wonderful Power and
Wisdom of God. If the hoase be so strong and warlike, what is the Almighty,
that man of war, Exodus 15.3. and Victor in Battle, as the Chaldee there calls
him? This is one way whereby we may conceive of God, scil. per viam eminemiae,
for if there be such and such excellence in the Creature, what is there in the
Creator, since all that is in us is but a spark of his flame, a drop of his
Ocean? How then will thou, O Job, dare to contend with him, who art not able to
stand before this Creature of his? Wonderful things are reported concerning
Bucephalus, and the horse of Julius Caesar, of Nicom^des King of Bithynia, of
the Sibarites War-horses, Qui ad symphonia cantum saltatione quadam movebantur.
Pausan.
The Persians dedicated an horse to the Sun, so did the Idolatrous Israelites,
2 Kings. 23.11. as the swiftest Creature to the swiftest God. Very serviceable
he is for drawing and carrying, but especially in battle, whereof only here, De
equis militaribus and cataphractis; of War-horses, the use whereof appears to
be very ancient, even in Jobs days. The Israelites made little or no use of
them in the Conquest of Canaan; (...). Plut. in Numa
but their enemies there did, and Pharaoh before them, Exodus 14. Let it be held
that a horse is a vain thing for safety, neither shall he deliver any by his
great strength, Psalm. 33.17. The Jews are sharply reproved, and heavily
threatened for trusting to the horses of Egypt, Isai. 31.1.

Have thou clothed his neck with thunder?] That is, with neighing and
snorting, answerable to his strength, and which sounds terribly from within
his neck, till his very eyes sparkle, as if he did both thunder and lighten.
The Apostles, and other Ministers of God are called Christ's White horses, Rev.
6.1, 2. upon which he rides about the world conquering and to conquer: Horses
for their courage and constancy, and white for their purity of Doctrine,
Discipline and Conversation: They thunder in their Doctrine, and lighten in
their lives (as Nazianzen, says Basil, did) to the subduing of souls to the
obedience of faith.

Verse 20. Can thou make him afraid as a Grasshopper?] Which soon flincheth
and flies with the least noise. But the horse is more like that formidable
Army of Locusts described, Joel 2. that bare down all before them, and shook
all places where ever they came.

The glory of his nostrils is terrible] Heb. Terrors: His snorting and sneezing
strikes terror into people. The more wonderful is Gods goodness in subduing to
weak man so lusty a creature, to be ridden and ruled at his pleasure. He trains
him to the great saddle, and teaches him to obey his hand and spur, to bound
in the air, to observe his measures, to show that docility, dexterity and
vigor which none but God has given him, and be every way so serviceable and
useful both in War and Peace. Joannes Bodin has observed, That whereas Lions,
Wolves, Theas. Not. 405
and other ravenous creatures have a gall and choler, whereby they are easily
stirred up to anger and revenge: not so horses, asses, camels, elephants, and
other creatures made for man's help; these have neither gall nor horns, wherein
appears summa Opificis sapientia, the great wisdom and goodness of the
Creator.

Verse 21. He paweth in the valley] -- Cavatque
Tellurem, and solido graviter sonat ungula cornu. Virg. Georg. l. 3

Such is the impatiency of his spirit, that he champs his bit, and stamps with
his feet; Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula Campum. Virg.
he pricks up his ears, and grows white with foame, and can hardly be held in
till the enemy come, but would fain be in the battle; whither when he comes, he
runs upon the Pikes, and undauntedly casts himself and his rider among the
enemies squadrons: Quod sum mirum est, says Mercer. which is a wonderful
thing indeed: and it is no less wonderfully set forth by a most lively and
lightsome hypotyposis, giving us to see, as it were, the horses rushing into
the battle, and to hear him snoaring, and snorting with disdain and despite,
bringing every where horror and disorder.

Verse 22. He mocketh at fear etc.] Heb. He laugheth, by an elegant
Prosopopaeia, such as this Book is full of. Non vanos horret strepitus. He
fears no colors when once engaged in fight, but counts that a sport and play
whereof others are afraid.

Neither turns he back from the sword] Or any other offensive weapons, these
cannot make him turn tail or recoil, he is never more furious, then when he
sees himself covered with his blood. -- Vires animosque a vulnere sumit: Being
wounded, he biteth and kicketh, and fights no less stoutly then the Rider
himself does.

Verse 23 The Quiver rattleth against him] The Arrow: those messengers of death
come whisking and singing about his ears (so the bullets now in so much use)
but he is unappaled thereat.

The glittering Spear] Heb. The flaming Spear, as Genesis 3.24. that is, bright
and clear, shining like a flame of fire, which must needs be terrible: but not
at all to the War-horse.

And the Shield] Or rather Javelin, Lance, or the like he fears not a wood
of Pikemen set in array against him.

Verse 24. He swalloweth the ground with fiercenesse] He runs over it as fast
as if he did swallow it up at a draught. Terram pra cur. sus celeritate,
ebibere, and epotare videtur. Merc. In fremitu and commotione.
An hyperbolical Metaphor.

With fierceness and rage] Or, With commotion or unquietness; there is an
elegancy in the Original that cannot be englished.

Neither believes he that it is the sound of the trumpet] He is so over-joyed,
when that sign is given to begin the battle. Others, he cannot stand still when
he has once heard the sound of the Trumpet.

Verse 25. He says among the Trumpets, Ha, ha] Or, Euge. A Note of rejoicing,
which he seems to utter in his language: these are Poetical terms.

He smells out the battle afar off] He knows that the onset is about to be
given. Pliny writes, That horses will perceive aforehand the very time of the
fight if it be but

By the thunder of the Captains, and the shouting] The Captains adhortation,
and the Soldiers acclamations, etc. The Hebrew word signifies the noise
either of joy or sorrow; both are commonly heard in battles. For every battle
of the Warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood, Isai.
9.5. The glory of all this that is said of the horse, Bodin. theat. Not. p. 407.
the Lord assumeth to himself; and yet the horse is not so courageous, but that
he is as much afraid of, and troubled at the sight of the Stone Taraxippe
(which therehence also has its name) as the Elephant is at the sight of an
Hog, and a Lion of a Cock, wherewith they have a natural antipathy, as
Naturalists tell us.

Verse 26. Pennabi^
Does the Hawk fly by thy wisdom?] Or, Does the hawk plumescere get her
feathers by thy wisdom? The word comes from a root which signifies, strong,
because the strength of fowls is in their wings, their delight in high flying.
Has the Hawk her wings from thee? and does she recruit and use them, artificio
and auspicio tuo, by thy Art or Industry? Tame them indeed men may, and bring
them to hand, as Falconers do, for pleasure more then for profit; but neither
can they give them their wings, nor repair them when broken.

And stretch her wings toward the South] Thereby to furnish her self with a
second plumage, whilst she flies into those hotter Countries, where (as they
say) her old feathers by the Suns heat fall off, and new tome in their room.

Verse 27 Does the Eagle mount up at thy command?] Mount plum up (which no bird
else can do) to an infinite height, even out of sight; not without an eye still
to her prey, which by this means she spies sooner, and seizes upon better. A
fit emblem of an hypocrite, who seems to soar aloft, but it is for some self
and sinister respect; Mat. 24.
he seeks not the Lord Jesus Christ (as the sincere hearted do) but his own
belly, Romans 16.18.

And make her nest on high] Not in plains, but on lofty tops, and inaccessible
Rocks, for the safety of her young ones. Of the nature of Eagles, read
Aristotle, De Not, Animal. lib. 9. cap. 32. and Pliny, lib. 3. cap. 10. They
tell us, That there is an enmity between the Eagle and the Serpent; and because
the Serpent seeks to destroy the young Eagles, she sets her nest on high
to safeguard them. And if any man seek to rob her nest, she doubts not to
assault him with her wings and talons. Formidable she is to all birds save only
the Hawk, who is able to deal with her if he can but avoid the first shock.

Verse 28. She dwells and abides upon the rock etc.] Which are
counterscarfed and encompassed with Precipices; there she makes her nest in the
clefts and crags. The reason whereof see in the Note on the Verse afore-going.

Upon the crags of the Rocks] She nesteth not upon the sand as the Ostrich
does, ver. 14. And in this so great difference of birds and other creatures, is
seen the wonderful Power and Providence of God.

Verse 29. From thence she seeks the prey] Besides fowls, (whereof she is
called the Queen) she preyeth upon Hares, Hinds, Foxes, and such other beasts,
as she can master. Hence that complaint of the Hare, In me omnis terraeque
marisque aviumque ruina est. Martial.


And her eyes behold afar off]. To a very great distance. She is sharp-sighted,
and first sees her prey, and then seeks it. She is also so strong sighted, that
she can look intently into the body of the Sun, without being dazeled; and by
that property makes proof of her young ones whether they be right or not. Those
that cannot so behold the Sun, she drives out of the nest as spurious. Those
that can, she owneth, Schol, in Deu^ 32.11.
and bears abroad with her upon her wings (as Munster notes out of R.
Solomon) that none can shoot them, but through her body: and thereto Moses
alludeth Exodus 19.4.

Verse 30. Her young ones also suck up blood] Heb. They glut-glut blood; the
Hebrew word, jegnalegna dam, seems to be made from the sound in sucking. The
young Eagles, not yet able to tear the prey brought unto them by the old one
with their talons, suck the blood with their Beak, and so are flesht in blood
betimes.

And where the slain are, there is she] This is true of all the kinds of
Eagles, but especially of the Vulturine Eagle, which is of a very sharp smell
as well as sight, and by a strange sagacity of nature, resorteth with her young
to places of slaughter and bloodshed; she follows Armies, and feeds on
carcasses, which they can smell, say some Naturalists, before the battle be
fought. And can this be of any one but the Lord. Our Savior alludeth to this
Text, Mat, 24.28. Where the carcass is, there will the Eagles be also. See my
Note on that place.

CHAP. XL. Verse 1. Moreover the Lord answered Job and said]
HIC verisimile est aliquantisper Deum tacuisse, says Mercer. Here it is
likely that God held his peace a while, and seeing that Job replied not, he
added the following words, the more fully to convince and affect him. There is
somewhat to do to reduce a sinner from the error of his way, yea, though he be
in part regenerate, the flesh will play its part against the Spirit. This must
be considered, and all gentleness used to those that offend of infirmity, aster
Gods example here.

Verse 2. Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him?] Or, An
disputare cum Omnipotente est eruditio?
Is it wisdom to contend with the Almighty? No, but the greatest folly and
sottishness. Job might think otherwise, so long as he compared himself with
others; but being once set by God in his superexcellencies considered, he shall
see his own nothingnesse, and sit down in silence and patience, though
severely tried, and sharply afflicted.

He that reproves God, let him answer it] Answer it if he can, or else yield
the cause. Praestat herbam dare quam turpiter pugnare. But if Job have yet
further a mind to question and quarrel God in any his ways and works, let it
be heard what answer he can return to what has been already spoken.

Verse 3. Then Job answered the Lord, and said] 'Twas time for him, if ever, to
stoop to the Most High, so far condescending to his meannesse, and to answer
his expectation by acknowledging a fault, and promising amendment. Lo this is
the guise of a godly person: He may be out, but he will not usually be
obstinate. An humble man will never be an Heretic; convince him once, and he
will yield: Not so the obstinate and uncounsellable person; he runs away with
conviction, as the unruly horse does with the bit between his teeth: and his
wit will better serve him to devise a thousand shifts to elude the truth, than
his pride will suffer him once to yield to it, and acknowledge his error.

Verse 4. Behold I am vile] Light and little worth: and therefore deserve to
beslighted and laid by, as a broken vessel. The humble man vilifies, yea,
nullifies himself before God, as Abraham, Genesis 18.27. as Agur, Prove. 30.2. as
Paul, Ephesians. 3.8. as that Martyr who cried out, Gehenna sum Domine, Lord, thou
art heaven, but I am hell, etc. Tantillitas nostra, says Ignatius of himself
and his colleagues. Behold, 1 am an abject says Job here, contemptible, and
inconsiderable. This was well, but not all: an excellent confession, but not
full enough: his meannesse he acknowledges, and that he was no fit match for
God: but not his sinfulness, with desire of pardon, and deprecation of
punishment: God therefore gives him not over so, but sets upon him a second
time, verse. 6. and brings him to it, chap. 42.1. There must be some proportion
betwixt a man's sin, and his repentance, Ezra. 9. and this, God will bring all
his Jobs to, ere he leave them.

What shall I answer thee?] I am silenced, and set down; I see there is no
reasoning against thee. I acknowledge thy greatness so plainly and plentifully
demonstrated in the foregoing discourse: and am well pleased that thou
should be justified when thou speak, and overcome when thou judge,
Psalm. 51.4. Romans 3.4.

I will lay my hand upon my mouth] I that have spoken more freely and boldly
then I ought, Et ore patulo multa sine judicio effutivi; and have opened my
mouth more wide then was meet: will henceforth be better advised, and keep my
mouth with a bridle, or muzzle, as Psalm. 39.1. See the Note on chap. 21. verse.
5.

Verse 5. Once have I spoken, but I will not answer] It Is enough of that Once:
The Saints running out, and meeting with a bargain of sin, come back by
weepingcrosse, and cry, What have I to do any more with wickedness, Hos. 14.8?
Judah knew his daughter Tamar no more, Genesis 38.26. If I have done iniquity, I
will do no more, chap. 34.31, 32. That was Elihu's counsel; and now it is Jobs
practice.

Tea, Twice] That is, Often: so eager was I set upon a dispute. This was an
Aggravation of Jobs sin, the committing of it again and again. Numbers added to
numbers are first ten times more; then, an hundred; then, a thousand, etc. This
has been thy manner from thy youth, Jeremiah, 22.21. that was an ill business.

But I will proceed no further] sc. In this controversy. I will not come into
the lists to contend with thee. I see there is no safety in such a contest. In
many things we offend all, says St. James: and he is a perfect man who sins
not with his tongue. But as he who has drunk poison, makes haste to cast it
up again, ere it get go the vitals: so should we deal by our daily misdoings.
It is not falling into the water that drowns a man, but lying long under it.
Bewail thy sin, and hasten to get out of it.

Verse 6. Then answered the Lord unto Job out of a Whirl-Wind] As before, chap.
38.1. notwithstanding Jobs submission. See the reason on verse. 4. God took his
out-bursts against him so very ill, that he is not easily pacified; but the
better to abase Job, and quite to break the neck of his pride, he answers him
again angerly, not by a soft and still voice, as he dealt by Eliah, but out of
the whirlwind, though with some abatement of terror, as Rainban conceives
from the leaving out here the notificative Article, set before Segnarab the
whirlwind in the 38 chapter. Peter was not over-forward to comfort those that
were pricked at heart with sense of sin, and fear of wrath; but presses them
yet further to repent, Act. 2.38. Men are apt to slight and slubber over the
work, doing it to the halves; and must therefore be held hard to it, lest it
should not be done to purpose.

Verse 7. Gird up thy loins now like a man] Resume new strength, and prepare
your self for a second encounter: for I have not yet done with you. If
therefore you think your self able to stand in contention with me, show your
valor. See the Note on chap. 38.3.

Verse 8. Will thou also disannul my judgment?] Do thou think to ruin my
justice, to establish thine own innocence? and will thou needs be a superior
judge over me? Will thou not revoke thy former expostulations and complaints
against me, and with open mouth give me my due glory? Here God shows his
dissatisfaction with Jobs former confession.

Will thou condemn me, that thou may be righteous?] Job had bolted out some
words that either tended to this purpose, or seemed so to do to the just grief
and offense of his friends. For this therefore he must be better humbled, and
henceforth learn to abstain not only from things simply evil, but seemingly so;
quicquid fuerit male coloratum, (as Bernard has it) whatsoever looks but
ill-favouredly.

Verse 9. Have thou an arm like God?] That thou should wrestle a fall with
him, and hope to over-match him? Thou have a mighty arm, says David, strong is
thy hand, and high is thy right hand. Psalm. 89.13. It spans the heavens, and
holds the earth in the hollow of it. The weight of it broke the Angels backs:
and the terror of it may be seen in all those writs of execution recorded in
the Scriptures. Oh its a fearful thing, says the Apostle, to fall into the
(punishing) hands of the living God, Heb. 10.

Or can thou thunder with a voice like him?] Of Pericles the Orator it is
said, that when he declaimed, Intonabat, fulgurabat, totam Graeciam
commiscebat, etc. Cicero.
he thundered, he lightened, he mingled all Greece together. And Livy, speaking
of a certain Roman Commander, says, Haec cum intonuisset iracundus, etc. These
things when he had thundered out angerly, and with a courage, the people
departed of their own accord. Alexander the Great, being once vexed at his
Soldiers for mutining and tumultuating, thunderstruck them with these words,
Facessite hins acyus, neminem teneo; liberate occulos meos ingratissimi
milites; Get you quickly out of my presence, and be packing hence, ye
ungrateful Soldiers. And Severus the Emperor in like sort dealt with his
unruly Army, Discedite Quirites, said he, et incertum an Quirites; These were
terrible hard words, and very resolutely uttered: But what is any, or all of
this to the voice of Gods thunder, whereof see before? Know thou not, O Job,
that thine arm is an arm of flesh? and thy voice so small and low, that a Fly
would not be frighted at it?

Verse 10. Deck thy self now with Majesty and Excellency] Or, With
magnificence, and sublimity. etc. i. e. Deum age, show thy self as God: for he
thus decks himself, Psalm. 93.1. and 96.6. and 104.1, 2. Job 29.14.

And array thy self with glory and beauty] That thou may appear, Os
humerosque Deo similis, as Herod afterward in his cloth of silver, which being
beaten upon by the Sunbeams (says Josephus) dazeled the peoples eyes, and
drew from them that fond acclamation, It is the voice of a God, Act. 12.22.

Verse 11. Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath] In this glorious equipage; make
thy just indignation felt by all the rebels of the world. Nemo te impune
lacesset.

And behold every one that is proud] Look upon him oculo minaci, with a flaming
eye: look through him, let him see thy displeasure. Upon some God looks, to
convert them, as Christ did upon Peter, Luke 22.61. Upon others, to confound
them, -- (...).

And abase him] Abate his pride, and abase his pomp, and greatness: this is
God-like, Psalm. 147.6. Aesop being asked by Chilo (one of the seven wisemen of
Greece) What God was doing? Answered, He abaseth the proud, and exalts the
lowly-minded. Tamberlain, to manifest that he knew how to punish the haughty,
made Bajazet the great Turk to be shackled, and shut up in an iron cage, and so
carried up and down as he passed through Asia, to be scorned and derided of his
own people. And when one of his Favorites requested him to remit some part of
his severity against the person of so great a Prince: Tamberlain answered,
Turk. hist. f. 22^
That he did not use that rigor against him out of hatred to the man, but to
manifest the just judgment of God against the arrogant folly of so proud a
Tyrant.

Verse 12. Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low] This God does,
Isai. 2.11, 12, 17. and 5.15. The Babel-builders, Pharaoh, Sennacherib,
Nebuchadnezzar, Herod, Dioclesian, Attilas, and others for instances; Amurath
the third King of Turks, in the pride of his heart, styled himself, God of the
Earth, Governor of the whole World, Turk. hist. f. 920
the Messenger of God, and faithful Servant of the great Prophet. This proud
Prince was slain by an half-dead Christian Soldier, who coming to crave his
life of him after a battle, Ibid. 200.
stabbed him in the bottom of his belly with a short dagger; of which wound
that King and Conqueror presently died. See the Note on verse. 11.

And tread down the wicked in their place] Heb Under them; lay them as low as
may be. God puts away all the wicked of the earth as dross, he treads them,
as vile things, under his feet, Psalm. 110.1. till they bethink themselves, and
humble their souls at his feet for mercy: for then he will make the place of
his feet glorious, as he promises, Isai. 60.13. and as Exodus 24.10. they saw
under Gods feet as it were, a paved work of Sapphire stone; to show that he had
now changed their condition, the Bricks made in their bondage, into Sapphire.
See Isai. 54.11.

Verse 13. Hide them in the dust together] Make a hand of them all at once, as
God can do his enemies by raking them all into the grave; yea, turning into
hell; whole Nations that forget God, a whole rabble of rebels that fight
against heaven, he can soon lay them low enough, even in that slimy valley,
where are many already like them, and more shall come after them, chap. 21.31,
32. Now when God bids Job do all this, who was himself lying in the dust,
full of sores and sorrows, how could he but he greatly ashamed, and affected
with grief for his former follies?

And bind^ their faces in secret] As Hamans face was covered when the King had
sentenced him, Esth. 7.8. See the Note there: Or rather, as dead-mens faces use
to be bound up and covered: for we like not to look on deaths face; Abraham was
desirous to bury his dead out of his sight, Genesis 23.4. though she had once been
the desire of his eyes, Ezekiel. 24.16. Lazarus came out of his grave with his
face bound about with a napkin, Job. 11.14. See the like done to our Savior,
Job. 20.6, 7. though there was as little need to have done it, as was of those
sweet spices brought by the good women to anoint his body, which could not see
corruption, Mark 16.1.

Verse 14. Then will I also confess unto thee, etc.] Or, I will give praise
unto thee, as thou by right should do to me: not for my goodness only, but
for my greatness and majesty also, in destroying the wicked. See David doing
it, Psalm. 18.27. and Moses, Exodus 15.1. and the whole quire of heaven, Revel.
19.1, 2.

And that thine own right hand can save thee] That ^hou art self-sufficient,
and my compere; Et ego quoque praedicabo te beroa. Tig.
strong enough to maintain thine own cause, and that thou have some show of
reason to withstand me. This is that which we all naturally (but foolishly)
fancy. viz. that we are petty-gods within our selves: we would be absolute and
independent; when in truth all that we have is derivative; the Churches beauty
is borrowed, Ezekiel. 16. and we may say of all that we are, as he did of his
hatchet, Alas Master, I borrowed it, 2 King. 6.5.

Verse 15. Behold now Behemoth which I made with thee] i.e. The Elephant called
Behemoth; Vocatur Bellua per Antonomasiam, and (...) Graec.
that is Beasts in the plural, for his hugeness: as if he were made up of many
beasts. So David, aggravating his own brutishness, says, So foolish was I and
ignorant: I was as a beast (Heb. Behemoth, beasts in the plural) before thee,
Psalm. 73.22. that is, as a great beast: his sin swelled in his eyes, as a toad;
he befools and be-beasts himself, as reason required: for nothing is more
irrational, than irreligion.

Which I made with thee] Thy fellow creature, made to serve thee. He is in the
Chaldee called, (...) Pil; that is, Wonderful: because the wonders of Gods
glory do so marvellously appear in him. Made he was the same day with man, and
has a kind of familiarity and love to him, if brought up with him, doing him
great good service in Peace and War, and may be taught to adore Kings.

He eaieth grass like an Ox] He is not ravenous nor carnivorous; neither
eats he daily the grass upon a thousand hills, Lyra.
as the Hebrews foolishly fable, and that he is to be killed at the
resurrection to feast the Saints, as being a creature of a monstrous bigness.
As the Ox li^^eth up grass, Numb. 22.4. so does the Elephant; yet not with his
tongue, (which for so great a Beast is but little, neither read we here any
thing at all of his voice, (to teach great men, faith One; not to speak big
swollen words) but with his Trunk or great Snout, called his tail, verse 17 (as
Beza thinks) because it bears the resemblance of a tail, Arist. de N^^.
Anim l. 2. c. 5, 6.
and is of most mavelous and necessary use to him. With this he grazeth, and
with this he over-throweth trees, and then feeds upon them. But he does not
proudly abuse the mightiness of his limbs to the hurt of other cattle. yet he
will not be wronged, and is of so great strength, that no one man dare assault
him.

Verse 16. Lo now his strength is in his loines] Wherein he is so strong, that
he can bear a wooden Tower upon his back, and upon that two and thirty men
standing to fight therefrom. In India, where the hugest Elephants are, they
ride upon the bigger, plow with the lesser, and carry great loads and burdens
with both. For which and the like purposes, Junius.
totus robustissimus est superne and inferne. Howbeit God has chiefly placed
his strength, not in any offensive part (his head has no horns, nor his feet
no claws to do mischief with) but in his loins, and about his belly.

And his force is in the navel of his belly] Which must needs be very hard
undergirded, when so great weight is made fast to his back. Naturalists
observe, That the softest part of the Elephant is his belly; and therefore the
Rhinoceros, (his deadly enemy) sets upon him there with his crooked horn
whetted against a Rock, and overcomes him; yet is he stronger in his belly
then other Creatures are in the back: and therefore his Navel is here called
Navels in the plural. His skin is exceeding hard and rough, so that an Arrow
can hardly pierce it. Yet Eleazer, Machab. 6 rushing into the enemies Army, gat
under an Elephants belly, (upon which he thought King Antiochus rode) and
killed him, being himself crushed to death with the weight of the Beast falling
upon him.

Verse 17. He moves his tail like a Caedur] The Elephant has but a small and
short tail, for his bulk; Beza therefore renders it his prominent part which
is as the Cedar, and interprets it of his Pr^bofeis, or large Snout, Sic. and
Deodat.
which truly (says he) as being proper to the Elephant, and of very great use,
might not in any wise, be pretermitted in this description. See verse. 15.

The sinews of his stones are wrapped together] This is also another of the
Elephants properties, whose testicles are hidden and stick to his belly,
fastened there by certain sinews and ligaments, and do not hang as other
beasts testicles do. As his genital members are but small, considering his
bigness, so his lust to the female is not great, never coupling with her but
in secret, and when she is once filled forbearing her company.

Verse 18. His bones are as strong pieces of brasse] Or, As Conduit Pipes of
brass. whereby may be understood his hollow bones. as by bars of Iron the
solid ones and by both, (together with his Trunk, composed of gristles, and his
teeth and tushes eight foot long some of them) we may conjecture of the
bigness of his whole body; the hugest of all earthly creatures, says Pliny;
nine cubits high, says Elian of some. Now can Job look upon such a monstrous
creature, or hear his noise or stand before him without great horror? and will
he not submit to the great God and give him all his glory.

Verse 19. He is the chief of the ways of God] i.e. The Masterpiece among all
the beasts (and perhaps first made) as Man is among all earthly creatures,
being divini ingenii cura; as One calls him. Of all earthly irrational
creatures, the Elephant is the hugest and strongest and of most understanding.

He that made him can make his sword to approach unto him] i.e. God alone can
deal with him, and kill him. for no man dare undertake him unless it be by Art
and cunning; and that in Jobs days, likely, was not yet known or practiced.
And if God had not given an horn to the Rhinoceros, and poison to the Dragon
(who are the Elephants most mortal enemies) there were no beasts to be found
that could have the better of him. He is of himself long-lived, says
Aristotle. but God can, and does cut him off at his pleasure; and so he will
those masterlesse Monsters that persecute his people, though they may seem to
be out of the reach of his rod. Some read the words thus, He that made him,
made his sword to be near him; and intepret it of his Proboscis, or Snout,
wherewith, as with a sword, he fights, and does many feats. Curtius says, That
when Porus the Indian King, being wounded in battle, fell down armed to the
ground, his Elephant with his Trunk gently took him up, and set him upon his
back again. Some in their wars have fastened sharp swords to the Snouts of the
Elephants, and done much mischief therewith to the enemy.

Verse 20 Surely the Mountains bring him forth food] And food enough, though
he be of an huge body. Learn we to trust unto Gods providence for our
necessary provision: the earth is the Lords, and the fullness thereof. See
verse 15.

Where all the beasts of the field play] And play they may securely for him;
for he is so far from using his sword to destroy them, that when he is to pass
through the herds of other beasts or cattle, he makes way (says Pliny) with
his Snout, that he may not hurt any of them, and beckneth to them therewith, as
it were with his hand, that he will only pass by them, and do them no harm.

Verse 21. He lies under the shady trees] Vatablus reads the words
question-wise thus, Sic R. Levi. and Kimchi.
Lies he under the shady trees in the covert of the reeds and fens? No such
matter, he is too big to be shaded by trees, neither can reeds and fens cover
him. But Aristotle tells us, That he loves to lie by the banks of Rivers beset
with trees, Debist. anim. l. 9. c. 46 Plin. lib. 8. c. 10.
as being naturally hot, and bred in hot Countries: and yet he is impatient of
cold and winter. And therefore when Hannibal brought many Elephants out of
Africa into Italy, they all perished in the cold Alps, except only that one
whereupon Hannibal himself rode.

In the covert of the reed and fens] Hence Cardinus says, That the Elephant is
of a Swinish nature, Ad calorem frangendum crasso caeno per. funduntur. Plin.
delighted with mud and mire. And Gulielmus Parisiensis applies, Behemoth in
the fens, to the devil in sensual hearts. He sleeps in moist places, says
he; that is, in those that lie melting in sinful pleasures and delights:
therefore Luke 11. it is said, that he walks in dry places, seeking rest, but
finding none: and Ezekiel 47.11. when the waters of the Sanctuary overflowed, the
miry places could not be healed.

Verse 22. The shady trees cover him with their shadow etc.] He leans against
those trees, and sleeps, for lie down and rise again he cannot for want of
joints in his limbs. And why may not we conceive the trees in those parts big
enough to overshade the Elephant; when as in America, but especially in
Brasile, the trees are so huge, Abbots Geog. page 271.
that it is reported of them, that several families have lived in several arms
of one tree, to such a number as are in some petty Village or Parish amongst us?

The willowes of the brook compass him about] To shelter him from the wind and
cold. And although they cannot swim, they are so big, yet they love to be about
pooles and brooks for shade, and to ease their thirst; for the Elephant
drinks off fourteen firkins of water in a morning, says Aristotle, and eight
at night, as it follows,

Verse 23. Behold he drinks up a River, and hastes not] Viz. Through fear,
tanquam canis ad Nilum, as the dogs that drink at Nilus fear the Crocodile; or
as they of this Land anciently drank in fear of their lives the whiles, and
were therefore wont to have some friend to undertake for their safety: whence
that expression of him who is drunk to, I Will pledge for you. The Elephant as he
drinks huge draughts (beyond that of the Camel, Lib. 8. cap. 18.
who drinks, says Pliny, Et in praeteritum, and in futurum, for both the
time past, and the time to come) so he drinks without disturbance for who dare
deal with him? Other cattle, through the frightfulness of their disposition,
break their draughts to stare about them. Not so the Elephant, who drinks as
if, he would exhaust and drain dry the River, and steps into it with such a big
body as if he would stop the course of it; therefore some read the words thus,
He hinders the River that is hastes not. Some by he hastes not, understand
that custom of the Elephant, not to drink, till he have first by going into,
and stirring the water made it pudley, for he loves not clear waters, as Elian
writes. Neither yet does he at any time enter higher into a River then he can
breath through his large Snout, for swim he cannot by reason of the
weightinesse of his body, says Aristotle. Hist. anim. l. 9. cap. 46.


He trusts that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth] In the vast imagination
of his fancy he conceits that he can devour and drink up whole Jordan at once.
Jordan is the greatest River of Canaan, running along the Land, and falling
into the dead Sea which yet grows no bigger by swallowing it. Hereunto some
think, that this Text alludeth. But better by Jordan here, (which arises from
the root of Lybanus, and as some say, from a double fountain, the one on the
right side called Dan, and the other on the left called Jor) we may understand
by a Synecdoche, any River; and so these words are nothing else but an
hyperbolical repetition of the former.

Verse 24 He takes it with his eyes] It, that is, Jordan, which he thinks when
he sees it, to drink up at a draught; but it is better filling his belly then
his eye, as we say. Others, He thrusts his head in up to the eyes through
extreme greediness. Brentius reads it, Oculis suis capitur ipse, decipulis
perforatur nasus; and says, That this Creature is taken only by his eyes and
nose; for otherwise he is as slick and slippery as an Eele; so is Satan (says
he) neither can we shun his wiles but by the Spirit of faith. In Genesis 3. p. 67.
But Nouns hoc spumosum? Luther in one place calls allegories, Spumam
Scripturae, the froth of the Scriptures: and in another, the allegorical sense
is a beauteous harlot, that inticeth idle men, who think themselves in
Paradise, and in Gods bosom when they fall upon such speculations. Gregory and
others (who have wholly allegorized this and the former chapter, applying all to
the devil and Antichrist) observed not what was the state and scope of this
disputation. Some read the Text thus, Will any take him in his fight, will any
pierce his nose with snares? q.d. That is not the way to take him, or hold him
when taken. He must be caught by wiles, and not by main force or open strength
(See Pliny to this purpose) although when he is once caught, he is soon tamed
and made tractable to many uses. See Aristotle's history of living Creatures.
Lib. 8. cap 8. et 9 Lib. 9. cap. 46.
Pliny says, he had seen Elephants dance on the Rope, and write Greek letters
with their feet, etc.

His nose pierces through snares] Or, Will any bear his nose to put in snares?
Though he be apt enough to be tamed and taught, yet he will not endure halter,
bridle, bit or ring in his nose; as neither will Leviathan, of whom the like is
spoken, chap. 41.1, 2.

CHAP. XLI. Verse 1. Caust thou draw out Leviathan with an book?]
AS men use to do the lesser fishes in angling? No, as little as thou can
bore Behemoths nose with a snare, chap. 40.24. Leviathan is a common name for
all great Sea Monsters, Psalm. 104.26. Beza and Deodate understand it of the
Crocodile, others of the Sea-Dragon: others of the whirl-pool: But most of the
Whale; in creating whereof, Creavit Deus vastitates and stupores, says One.
Lib. 9. cap. 2.
Pliny writes of them, when they swim and show themselves, an^are insulas
putes, you would think them to be so many Islands. Another says, they appear
like huge mountains; and that when they grow old they are so fat and
corpulent, that they keep long together in a place, so that upon their backs
(by the dust and filth gathered and condensed) grass and shrubs grow, as if
there were some Islands there; Heidfeld.
whereat Seamen attempting to land, have cast themselves into no small
dangers. Olam.
Some tell us of a Whale that would have covered four Acres of ground, his
mouth so wide, Plin. lib 9.
that he could have swallowed a whole Ship. Virgil calls Whales Monsters, the
Greeks call them. (...), Wild Beasts. The Majesty and Power of the Creator, is
much seen in these vast creatures. Psalm. 74.14. Thou brakest the hands of
Leviathan in pieces, and gave him to be meat to the people inhabiting the
wilderness. Here. upon the Jew-Doctors have fabled, that God at first made two
Leviathans only; the one whereof he gave to the Israelites in the wilderness to
feast with, the other he has salted up for a feast to be made for the Jews,
to be gathered together by the Messiah at the end of the world. Others have
turned all this, and a great part of the former chapter into allegories:
whereof see chap. 40, 24. Let us by the ensuing description take notice of, 1.
Gods Omnipotency, who has made such great wonders, whereof the sea has more
store then the earth, as they know well who are conversant therein. 2 His
Justice, who by these creatures often punishes Offenders Procopius tells us,
That in his time a great Whale much infested the coasts of Constantinople. and
did great mischief for fifty years together, till at length being taken and
brought to land he was found to be thirty cubits long, and ten broad. 3. His
Wisdom in making the Whale so complete in all its parts, which all have their
several uses; all which are here noted and numbered; how much more are our
members, yea, our very hairs? 4. His goodness in creating such Sea Monsters
for man's use and benefit in many particulars; as his flesh for meat, his fat
for oil his hide for thongs, his teeth for combs, his bones for building,
mounding, Bodice making, etc. In Africa the Whales bones serve commonly for
rafters of houses. Leviathan he is called of the fast joining together of his
scales and members, wherein consists his strength: and so does ours in unity.

Verse 2. Can thou put a hook into his nose?] Can thou ring him like a
Swine, or rule him like a Bear? God can, and did Sennacherib that crooked
Leviathan, Isai. 27, 1. and 37.29. And does still the Great Turk, who desires
to devour Christendom.

Or bore his jaw through with a thorn] Or twig, as men do lesser fishes, taken
with an Angle, or Herrings from the fish-market. These are facetious and
ironical questions that are put to Job in these five first verses: hinting to
him, that although he could not do any of these things, yet God could with ease.

Verse 3. Will he make many supplications unto thee?] As conquered Captives use
to do; witness Benhadad, 1 King. 20.32. and Teridates King of Parthians, who
being brought prisoner to Nero, thus bespake him; I come unto thee as unto my
God, (...). Dio in Neron.
and will henceforth worship thee as I do the Sun in heaven; I will be
whatsoever thou shall appoint me; for thou art my Fate and Fortune, etc.

Will he speak soft words unto thee?] Verba byssina; as unto his Lord and
Master. An elegant and pleasant Prosopopaeia? No, his stomach is too great, to
stoop so low.

Verse 4 will he make a Covenant with thee?] And compound, where he cannot
conquer.

Will thou take him for a servant for ever?] To be at thy dispose, and to do
thy drudgery? q.d. He scorns the motion. Before the fall, this and all other
Creatures were at man's service, Genesis 1.28. and 2.19, 20. But now alas it is
otherwise. Howbeit to those that are in Christ, this part of Gods lost image is
in part restored, Heb. 2.6. with Psalm 8.4.5. and shall be perfectly, Revelat.
2.26. What singular service the Whale did Jonas in shipping him to Land, who
knows not?

Verse 5. Will thou play with him as with a bird?] Shall he make thee sport, as
those poor birds that serve as pastime for little children? Or as the foolish
Emperor Honorius, delighted in his bird Roma (so he called it) at the loss
whereof, when the City was taken by the Vandals, he grieved more, then at all
the rest? I ^diguum sane, regem aves praeferre viribus, says the Divine
Chronologer.

Will thou bind him for thy maidens?] Shall your daughters tie him with a
thread. which lengthning or straightning at their discretion shall make his
prison either larger on straiter? Sena.


Verse 6. Shall the companions make a Banquet of him?] The Cetarii
Whale-fishers, who usually go out in companies. It was anciently held
impossible, and is still perilous to take the Whale, and make a banquet of
him; as the tongue and some other parts of the Whale are good meat. Or, Make a
Banques for him; shall they feast those Merchants they mean to sell him to,
they may get the better price for him?

Shall they part him among the Merchants?] Who might sell him out for sundry
uses. See verse. 1.

Verse 7. Can thou fill his skin with barbed irons?] Harpag^^ibus. Heb. With
thorns; scil. to pull him to the shore? Opianus, Albertus Magnus, Gesner, and
others now write, how Whales are to be taken; and experience proves it to be
feisable. They are sometimes cast upon the Land by the surging rage or violence
of the sea, or by the ebbing thereof, left in a ford where they cannot swim,
and so they become a prey to the fishermen with their guns, darts, etc.

Verse 8. Lay thy hand upon him] Stroke him, clap him on the back, and see if
that way thou can win upon him, since by force thou can not catch and kill
him. Or draw near, and offer but the least violence to him if thou dare, and
he will quickly make thee repent it; so that thou will have little joy either
to flatter him, or to fight it out with him, for he will be the death of thee.

Verse 9. Behold the hope of him is in vain] Heb. Is lying. A man may promise
himself or others to take the Whale, but how or when will he effect it? It is a
misery to lie languishing at Hopes Hospital, and after all, to be disappointed;
to labor all night, and take nothing etc.

Shall not one be cast down even at the fight of him] Surely there is cause
enough to be cast down, if he be so big and dreadful to bebold as is reported.
See the Note on Verse 1.

Verse 10. None is so fierce that dare stir him up] Unless he be ambitious of
his own destruction: cruel (so the word here signifies) to his own life,
which hereby he desperately casts away. Aristotle tells us, That fishes do
sleep; and perhaps these greater fishes take more sleep. Now who dare awake
them sleeping, or encounter them waking, and rouling in the waters? None surely
but a mad man.

Who then is able to stand before me?] Et est qui coram me stet? No more surely
then a man before a Whale, or a glass bottle before a Cannon shot. Here then we
have the accommodation and application of the former Discourse, which we must
not look upon as cunningly devised fables, 2 Pet. 1.16. or read as we do the
old stories of forragne businesses, but as that wherein our selves are nearly
interested and concerned, that we may give God the glory of his Power, (as
here, far beyond that of the Whale or any other creature) and of his Justice,
as verse 11, 12.

Verse 11. Who has prevented me that I should repay him?] Who can tax me with
injustice, who am bound to no man, but Owner of all things? If any one can say,
I am beholding to him, let him prove it, and I shall readily requite it: he
shall have no cause at all to complain of me as ungrateful, Romans 11.34, 35.

Whatsoever is under the whole heavens is mine] The Devil told our Savior that
all was his, and to whomsoever he would, he gave it, Luke 4.6. The Pope also,
(that first born of the Devil) takes upon him, as Lord of all, to dispose of
Spirituals or Temporals in all Countries, as Boniface the VIII wrote to Philip
King of France, who answered him with a Sciat fatuitas tua, etc. And as the
Pope that then was, gave our Henry the Eighth's Kingdom, prime occup^turo, to
him that should first take it; but he slighted him with Os Pupae and culus
Diaboli in eodem sunt praedicamento. It is for God alone to say, as Dan. 4.32.
I rule in the Kingdom of men, and give it to whomsoever I will. How then can I
do any man wrong who am obliged to none, but all are engaged to me for all they
have?

Verse 12 I will not conceal his parts nor his power] That therein, as in a
picture of the most principal piece of my Workmanship, thou may behold how
great, and how glorious a God I am. In the year of Grace 1577, July 2. the
Ship-men took a Whale not far from Antwerp. the picture whereof was printed and
published to this effect, His hide was without scales, and of a leaden color,
he was 85 foot long, and sixteen soot high. From his mouth to his eyes was
fifteen foot; from his eyes to his finnes, four foot and three fingers, etc.
Such a kind of picture, or character of this Sea Monster we have here, from the
most skilful hand of heaven. Pliny observes that pictures of things exact and
excellent, are seldom drawn but with great disadvantage. Not so this in the
text, as will appear in the sequel.

Nor his comely proportion] Heb. Nor the grace of his disposition. i.e. Dicam
quam egregie and concinne membra ^jus composita sint; I will declare how finely
and fitly all his parts are proportioned, Vatab.
and put together. In the most deformed Creatures (as we count them) there is
no part superfluous, useless, or uncomely. Deus est magnus in minimis, nec
parnus in maximis.

Verse 13. Who can discover the face of his garment?] That is, says Piscator,
Who can pull him out of the sea, wherewith he is covered as with a garment? Who
can slip off his skin whiles he is alive; as men do the Eels-skin, say others?
Who (as men use to do when horses are to be saddled) will take off his cloth,
and set the saddle upon his back? This last is Beza's Paraphrase: and it suits
best with that which follows.

Or who can come to him with his double bridle?] Let it be never so large, or
strong, his mouth is too wide, his jaws too strong, to be held in with bit and
bridle, lest he come near unto thee.

Verse 14. Who can open the doors of his face?] The two-leaved-doors of his
jaws, to let in a bridle? Sampson durst venture upon a roaring Lion and rend
him, as a man would rend a Kid. But never durst any such thing be done to a
Whale.

His teeth are terrible round about] The Whales teeth are said to be 120. each
tooth four cubits long.

Verse 15. His Scales are his pride] They are like so many glistering shields,
wherein he puts his confidence, and takes his pride; as thinking them
impenetrable.

Shut up together as with a close seal] So closed and put together, like Paper
sealed with Wax, as that nothing can part them. The Jews use to write upon the
back of their sealed Letters, Nun, Cheth, Shin; that is, Niddui, Cherem, and
Shammatha; all sorts of Excommunication to those that open them.

Verse 16. One is so near to another, that no air, etc.] One scale or flake is.
This is more proper, say some, to the Crocodile, than to the Whale: but who can
tell the several kinds of Whales, Vide Cocceium. in locum.
some whereof are said to have great and thick scales closely compacted as
here? Quod si squammae Leviathan ita cohareant, ut earum opere textili densato,
etc. Let the Saints strengthen themselves by close-sticking the one to the
other, as the primitive Christians did; so that the very heathens acknowledged,
that no people under Heaven did so hold together and love one another; as they;
being like that Sacra cohors, holy band of Soldiers in the Theban Army, which
consisted (...), Athenaeus. lib. 3.
of such only who were joined together in the bonds of love: and these they
esteemed the prime of all their strength in battle.

Verse 17. They are joined one to another, etc.] They are lapt over one
another, like tiles on a house. See the Note on verse. 16.

Verse 18. In sublime nimbos efflat. Plin. lib. 9. c. 6.
By his neesings, a light does shine] When this dreadful Monster sneezeth, or
snorteth, fire breaks out at his eyes and nose. By this neezing of the Whale
is meant the abundance of white frothy water which he casts forth at his
nostrils.

And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning] Bright and beamy. Olaus
writes of the Norway Whales, that their eyes shine in a dark night like a
fire: so that Mariners have often thought, when they have seen them, that they
saw a great fire.

Verse 19. Out of his mouth go burning lampes] This and those that follow are
all hyperbolical expressions. Here he is brought in as a spit-fire, as the
Devil was wont to be in Plays and Pageants. And by this passage, some
conjecture, that not the Whale, but the Sea-dragon is here described. Let it be
what it will, it must needs be a great heat within this great Fish, that
sends forth, as it were, burning lamps, and sparks of fire; and a strong
sulphurous breath he must have like the out-bursts of Aetna, by this
description. Aristotle says the Whale is of an hot fiery nature; and that he
has Lungs, and breaths: a pipe or passage also he has in his forehead,
Lib. 4. (...) anim. cap. (...)
whereat he throws out the water he has taken in, either by his breathing,
or eating. This transparent water thus with a force thrown up against the
Sunbeams, may bear a show of lightning, or burning lamps.

Verse 20. Out of his nostrils goes smoke, etc.] Whiles his meat heateth in
his stomach for concoction; Sufflati.
as if fire were put under some great reaking pot or Caldron boiling: Heb.
blown; for of blowing comes boiling.

Verse 21. His breath kindles coals] Or, Would kindle coals (as a Smiths
bellows) if there were any to kindle. Such a kindle-coal was Arrius and
Hildebrand of old: the Jesuits at this day, and not a few others, Prove. 26.21.
Es. 33.10. your breath as fire shall devour you. Some men's tongues are like
Gunpowder, which touched with the least spark, will instantly be in the face,
Jam. 3.6. A flame goes out of their mouths, enough to set the whole course of
Nature on fire.

Verse 22. In his neck remains strength] Aristotle says, that among Fishes,
De part (...) lib. 3.
the Dolphin, Whale, and such as breath; have necks proportionable to their
bodies. The word rendered remains, is in the Hebrew, lodges, or abides all
night: so spoken, says One, because the Whale, as also the Dolphin, sleeps
with his head erected above water.

And sorrow is turned into joy before him] i.e. He knows no sorrows, he fears
no hurt, but always rejoices, bearing himself bold upon his strength, God
having made him to sport in the sea, Psalm. 104.26. Others read it, And before
him danceth fear; Pavor and Pallor, (Tullus Hostilius his two gods) men dance,
or start for fear.

Verse 23. The flakes of his flesh are joined together] Heb. The fallings,
Meland Tremell
or the refuse and vilest parts, as the word is rendered, Am. 8.6. Now if God be
so punctual in the description of these also, can any one think that he has
let pass any thing in the holy Scriptures, that belong to our Salvation? What
need is there then of humane traditions?

They are firm in themselves] Heb. Moulton. Firm they must be, because so
joined together. Vis unita fortior; but dissension is the mother of
dissolution. England is a mighty Animal (says a great Politician) which can
never die, except it kill it self.

They cannot be moved] Or, He cannot be moved. He may say, as Terminus of old,
Nullicedo, I give place to none, unless I please.

Verse 24. His heart is as firm as a stone] He is corpore and cord
validissimus. Of the sword-fish, Plutarch says, that he has a sword, but not
an heart to use it. But the Whale has courage to his bulk; his heart is as
firm as a stone, (...).
as his head (says Scaliger) is as hard as a flint. In the hearts of some
creatures, says Aristotle, is found a bony, or grisly hardness; but the Whales
heart is all as it were a bone; and this bone as a stone.

As a pair of the nether milstone] Metae, upon which the whole weight lies:
the Greek call it (...), Mat. 18.6. the Mill-Ass; because it is the bigger and
harder of the two. The vulgar here for the nether Millstone, has the
smiths-Anvil, which by hammering, is made harder.

Verse 25. When he raises up himself, the mighty are afraid] When he shows
himself like some moving mountain upon the surface of the water, the most
assured Pilotes or passengers are seized with fear of death, and seek to make
peace with God, as those Mariners did, Jon. 1.5, 6, etc.

By reason of breakings] Broughton reads of shiverings.

They purify themselves] Expiantse, they beg pardon of sin, and prepare to
die, Others render it aberrant, they are dispirited; and know not what course
to take. Others again, they purge downwards. their retentive faculty being
weakened with fear, they let go their excrements: as Loper the traitor did,
when he was upon his trial before the Lords of the Council: and as God
somewhere in Ezekiel threatens his rebels, that for fear of his displeasure
they shall not be able to hold their water.

Verse 26. The sword of him that lays at him cannot hold] So close are his
scales, so thick his skin, that there is no wounding of him. There was not of
old, it seems. But now there is a way found of shooting and piercing of him,
so that he dies with an horrible noise, and outcry.

Nor the Harbergeon] A defensive weapon will be as useless, as those other
offensive: for the Whale will soon swallow up the armed, as well as the unarmed.

Verse 27. He esteems iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood] He makes
nothing of any thing that shall be done against him. Bears and Lions may be
wounded with hunting-weapons: other Fishes with Eele-spears, and the like: not
so the Whale, or not so easily.

Verse 28. The arrow cannot make him flee] Heb. Sons of the bow, as chap. 5.7.
Sparks are called sons of the coal. Arrows were then as much in use as bullets
are now.

Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble] Those stones which the sling
castes with so much force, make as little impression upon his body, as a
festraw would, which the hand of a child should push.

Verse 29. Darts are counted as stubble] When any thing in the Decrees or
Decretals likes not the Pope, he sets Palea, that is, stubble upon it; or Hoe
non credo: so does this Leviathan upon all kind of weapons; he slightes them.
The word here rendered darts, is as strange, as the weapon it signifies is to
us unknown, lapides ballistae, an engine, whereby great stones were thrown
against Walls or Towers (as now Cannon-bullets) to make a breath in them.
Catapulta, aries vel simile aliquod tormentum, Be they what they will, the
Whale fears them not, no though they were as terrible to others, as those two
great pieces of Ordnance cast by Alphonsus Duke of Ferrara; the one whereof he
called the Earthquake, the other Grandiabolo, the great Devil

Verse 30. Acumina testacea.
Sharp stones are under him] Heb. Sharp pieces of the potsheard, which prick
him no more than if he lay upon the softest couch^; so hard is his belly.

He spreads sharp-pointed things upon the mine] When he might lie softer, he
scorns it: as our hardy forefathers some two or three hundred years ago. who
ordinarily lay upon straw-pallets covered with canvas, and around log under
their heads instead of a bolster. Hollinshed.
As for pillows, they said they were fit only for women in childbed, etc.

Verse 31. Plin. lib. 9. c. 3. and 6.
He makes the deep to boil like a pot] He troubles the whole Ocean: he makes
a mighty commotion in the sea, when he rouls himself therein upward and
downward, and casts up water on high through a certain conveyance, that he has
in his head.

He makes the sea like a pot of oyntment] Turning it into a foam, like the
scum of a boiling pot. Beza renders it thus, He makes the sea like a Mortar,
wherein colors are beaten: that is, the whirling of the water is like unto a
quern that is turned round of the painter, to temper his colors.

Verse 32. He makes a path to shine after him] A Ship does so, much more a
whale.

One would think the deep to be h^ary] By reason of the white shining foam left
behind him.

Verse 33. Upon earth there is not his like] Heb. There is no comparison of
him: Much was said before of Behemoth, but Leviathan is far beyond him for
hugeness and strength: which yet Mercer notes to be the work of God, and not
of Nature, quod humor solvat and infirmet; and therefore in reason earthly
creatures would be harder and stronger, than those in the sea.

Who is made without fear] He seems not to come into the world but to fear
nothing, and to defy all things. No creature carries it self so stately or
stoutly as the whale.

Verse 34. He beholds all high things] As far below him (be they never so
excellent) both for bulk of body, and stoutnesse of mind.

He is a king over all the children of Pride] Or, Over all the wild creatures
(so Tremellius and Buxtorf interpret it) which are proud and do domineer over
the tame ones, no less then Leviathan if he were amongst them, would do over
them.

CHAP. XLII. Verse 1. Then Job answered the Lord, and said.]
AFter that he had been so plainly and plentifully convinced by Almighty God;
1. That he was far short of him in eternity, Wisdom, Power, Providence, etc.
2. That he could not stand before Behemoth and Leviathan the works of his
hands; Job yields, submitting to Gods Justice, and imploring his Mercy; so
effectual is the word of Gods grace in the hearts of his Elect. It had need to
be an elaborate speech that shall work upon the conscience, such as was this
afore-going. Vide etiam quid afflictio faciat, says Mercer. See here also the
happy fruit of an affliction sanctified. By this shall the iniquity of Jacob
(of Job) be purged; and this is all the fruit, to take away his sin, Isai.
27.9. To make his works full, Rev. 3.2. Job had repented before, chap. 40.4, 5.
but not so completely. Dice his narrari paenitentiam Jobi plenam, says
Piscator: Here he does it thoroughly by a deep and downright repentance, such
as was never to be repented of.

Verse 2. I know that thou can do every thing] Gods power is either Absolute
or Actual. By the former he can do every thing, make a world, and unmake it in
an instant; of stones raise up children to Abraham, etc. By the latter.
whatsoever he wills, that he does both in heaven and in earth, and none can
withstand him. This Job knew before, but now better, because by experience, and
unquestionable evidence given in by Gods own mouth. And although this be but a
short acknowledgment of Gods Power and Justice, yet is it well accepted, Merlin.
as proceeding from a true sense of faith. Neque exigis Deus a nobis multa
verba, sed multam fidem.

And that no thought can be with holden from thee] Te non solum omnia posse,
sed and omnia nosse; That thou art not only Omnipotent, but Omniscient, and
that not so much as a thought of any man's heart (which also is of thy making)
can be hid from thee; since which way soever he turns him, he shall find thee
both potent and present. The words may be read thus, And that no thought of
thine can be cut off or hindered. Having spoken of Gods power, Parem in eo esse
voluntatem (...) facultatem. Mercer. (...) Sep^. Nempe ego. Tigurin. (...) 1
Pet. 2.24
he speaks of his thoughts; to teach, says Calvin, That Gods Power and his
Will are things inseparable, his mind and hand agree together; the one to
determine, the other to effect.

Verse 3. Who is he that hides counsel without knowledge?] Quis iste est,
inquis Who is he, say thou ( chap. 38.2.) that hides counsel, etc. so
Tremellius renders it. Is ego ipse sum, I am the very man that have done it,
and now would as gladly undo it again, by an humble confessing and disclaiming
mine own folly therein, and by applying those words of thine to my self, with
an holy indignation; for therein thou have fully met with me.

Therefore have I uttered that I understood not] I have rashly and imprudently,
yea, gracelesly and impudently spoken of thy judgments, and desired to dispute
with thee; daring to reprehend that which I did not comprehend, and to pass my
verdict on things which I was not versed in, Idcirt^ indico me non
in^ellenisse. Merc.
Things too wonderful for me which I knew not. Broughton reads thus, Therefore
I tell, that I had not understanding; that is, I confess I have sinned, but I
did it ignorantly. And so he makes way to the ensuing Petition, That God would
hear him, and teach him better things.

Verse 4. Hear I beseech thee, and I will speak] We have had his confession
follow now his Petition here. his Humiliation and Reformation, verse 6. These
are the parts and properties of true repentance, that fair daughter of a foul
mother, Sin, But had not Job promised to speak no more, to proceed no farther,
chap. 40.4, 5. How then does he say here, I beseech, and I will speak; The
answer is easy; he would speak no more so rashly, and unadvisedly as he had
done, to Gods dishonor, and the offense of his best friends. But he would not
spare to speak Supplications, as here, and to set forth his humble docility to
give glory to God, and to take shame to himself, etc. such a silence he knew
would be sinful and savor of a dumb devil. He therefore addresseth himself to
God, 1. For audience and acceptance: 2. For advice and direction: In all which,
he renounceth his own wisdom, and delivers himself up wholly to God, to be
taught and led into all truth and holiness. The matter we see, is well amended
with Job, since challenging God into the Schools, he once said, Then call shou
me, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer thou me, chap. 13.22. So
afterward Peter, when penitent, turned his crowing into crying: and Paul, his
breathing out threatenings against the Saints, into, Lord, what will thou have
me do? Act. 9.1, 6.

I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me] As a dutiful and docible
Scholar, (who should be (...)) I will ask thee questions, and hang upon thy
holy lips for an answer.

Verse 5. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear] God has ordained,
that as death entered into the world at first by the ear, poisoned by that old
Manslayer, Genes. 3. so life shall enter into the soul by the same door: for
it is, Hear and your soul shall live, Isai. 55.3. And, The dead (in sins and
trespasses) shall hear the voice of the Son of God (sounding in his Ordinances)
and shall live the life of grace here, and of glory hereafter, John 5.25. This
great mercy Job had received, and he thankfully acknowledges it: But behold a
greater,

But now mine eyes has seen thee] Not only in the temple and whirlwind, those
clear testimonies of thy presence, but by some other special, glorious
apparition (so some think) and by a Spirit of Prophecy (as the Hebrews would
have it) by the inward teaching of thy Spirit howsoever, as Vatablus senseth
it, Et quando Christus Magister, quam cito discitur quod docetur; says Austin.
When God by his Spirit takes in hand to teach a man, he soon becomes a
skilful Scholar. Nescit tarda molimina Spiritus Sancti gratia, says Ambrose.
The Spirit is not long in teaching those that commit themselves to his tuition.
The hypocrite knows God but by hearsay, as a blind man knows colors; such
may say as those in the Psalm, Audivimus famam, something we have heard, and
some confused notions we have got concerning God and his will; but they are
merely disciplinary, but not intuitive, id est, Per speciem Propriam, etc. Such
as transformes the soul into the same Image; it is not that claritas in
intellectu quae parit ardorem in affectu, That light in the understanding that
kindles the affections. Job was such, witness his next words.

Verse 6. Wherefore I abhor my self] Aspernor illa; so Tremellius: I utterly
dislike those my former base and bald conceits of thee, my hard and unsauoury
speeches, mine impatient and imprudent carriages. Horreo quicquid de meo est,
ut meus sins, as Bernard expresses it. Reprobo meipsum, so Brentius; I do
utterly reject my self, I condemn mine own folly: I eat those words of
discontent at thy righteous proceedings, Dignasane quae per jugulum redeant.
Abiicio vitam meam, so Mercer and Lavater render it. Displiceo mihimetipsi, ac
pervelim ut aliter dixissem ac fecissem. Lavat. Jerem. 6.26. and 25.34. Virg.
Aeneid. lib. 12.
I cast away my life, and look upon it as lost, if thou should take the
forfeiture: I humbly put my self into the hands of justice, yet in hope of
mercy.

I repent in dust and ashes] As in an express and public penance. I throw my
self here upon the ground, I put my mouth in the dust, Lam. 3.24. Canitiem
i^^mundo perfusam pulvere turpo, I sprinkle dust and ashes upon mine head, in
token, that I have deserved to be as far under ground, as now I am above
ground; I repent my presumptuous misbehaviour with as lowly a spirit, as ever I
sinned with an high. Lo this was paenitentiam agere, quod est pro malo bonum
reponere, says Brentius; This was true repentance to change evil for good; as
piety for blasphemy, chastity for fornication, charity for envy, humility for
pride, Christ for Satan, And Reformation is the best Repentance, says Luther:
Such as so repent, are sure of comfort. The word here rendered, I repent,
signifies also to take comfort, as Ezekiel. 32.31. It is repentance unto life.
Acts 11.18. and such as accompanies salvation, Hebr. 6.9. Neither is it
wrought in any man but by a saving sight of Almighty God in his Greatness and
Goodness; such as may make him at once to tremble and trust, as Job did here,
and Isaiah chap. 6.1, 5.

Verse 7. And it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words to Job] And
Job those other again to God, it soon repented the Lord concerning his servant.
Pro magno delicto parum supplicii sat is est patri. A little punishment is
enough to a loving father for a great fault. Comfort ye, comfort ye my people,
says the Lord -- for (alas) they have received of my hand double for all
their sins. Terent. Isai. 40.1, 2.
So it seemed to him who is all bowels, and who in all their afflictions is
equally afflicted. God weeps on his peoples necks tears of compassion; they
weep at Gods feet tears of compunction. Oh beautiful contention!

The Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite] Because he was the ancienter man of
greatest Authority, and he that passed the heaviest censures upon Job, doing
enough to have driven him into desperation.

My wrath is kindled against thee] Thus God passes not sentence on Jobs side,
till he had first angerly repressed and reprehended those three friends of his,
who had assailed him without all right and reason. Let Gods servants hold out
faith and patience: sooner or later they shall be righted.

And against thy two friends Bildad and Zophar] Who stuck so close to thee and
chimed in with thee, against a better man then any of you all. As for Elihu, he
is neither commended here, nor condemned. He spoke well for the main, but many
times took Job at the worst, and misconstrued his speeches. He is therefore
punished (as Ambassadors are used to be when they commit undecencies) with
silence, which is the way royal to correct a wrong. The other three had great
cause to be much troubled and terrified at that short, but sharpest speech of
God, My wrath is kindled against you: for, Who knows the power of Gods wrath,
says David: It is as the Messenger of death, Psalm 90.11
and Harbinger of hell. God never said so much to Job, in all those long and
large speeches he made unto him, for he knew that milder words would do, and he
loves not to overdo. Ille dolet quoties cogitur esse ferox. By the way
observe, That although these three had offended more then Job, yet he was
afflicted, and they escaped free. Judgment begins at Gods house; neither
have any out of hell ever suffered more then those Worthies, of whom the world
was not worthy, Heb. 11. For ye have not spoken the thing that was right] And
yet they seemed to be all for God: and to plead his Cause against Job
throughout. But as in some things they were much mistaken, so they had their
self-respects, and were much biased in their discourses. Hypocrites and
Heretics (says Gregory here) seem unto men more righteous; but God accepts
them not for all their plausible pleas, and specious pretenses. Luke 16.15. Ye
are they (said our Savior to the Pharisees) who justify your selves before
men, but God knows your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed amongst men
is abomination in the sight of God.

As my servant Job hath] They also were Gods servants, but because they had
lent Satan their service against Job, and drawn from him many passionate
speeches, they are for a punishment set by after a sort; as David also was when
he had numbered the people, 2 Samuel 24.12. Go and say unto David. Now it is plain
David, who was wont to be my servant David, 2 Samuel 7.5. That Job is called Gods
servant, (and that emphatically and exclusively) is a very great honor done
him upon his repentance, and the like was done to David and Peter.

Verse 8. Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks] God reproves not his for
any other end, but that he may reduce them, and be reconciled unto them. The
Sun of righteousness loves not to set in a cloud.

Dejicit ut relevet: premit ut solatia praestet.
Enecat, ut possit vivificare Deus.
Seven Bullocks, and seven Rams] A great Sacrifice, whether we look to the
greatness of the Cattle, or the number; (especially if each of them were to
bring seven of each sort as some understand it) to show the greatness of their
sin, in not speaking right things of God and Job, though of a good intention,
and with a very fair pretense. Seven of each they were to bring, which is
noted for a number of perfection; and this pointed them of old (for the
Ceremonial Law was their Gospel) to the complete perfect Sacrifice of Jesus
Christ, the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world, every way sufficient to
expiate their sins, and to save them from the wrath to come. Its assured them
also, that God was through Christ perfectly satisfied, and pacified toward his
faithful people.

And go to my servant Job] Who was to do the honorable Office of a Priest for
them (as before the Law Abraham did, and Melchisedech and others) and is thrice
in this verse called, Gods servant, for honors sake; to the end that his
friends might the more respect him; whom before they had vilipended, and be
reconciled unto him, whom before they had wronged.

And offer up for your selves a burnt offering] Holocaustabit is holocaustum; a
whole burnt Offering: Where we must not imagine, that God took delight in the
smell or rather stench of the burnt beasts hides and all, but in the faith of
those that offered them, who also were hereby inminded of their sins (for which
they had deserved to be burnt in hell) and of their duties, to mortify their
earthly members and to present their bodies a living Sacrifice, holy,
acceptable unto God, Romans 12.1.

And my servant Job shall pray for you] Which as he could do very well, Ezekiel.
14.14. so he should now do, to show his hearty reconciliation; but should have
little availed for them, had not they repented, and believed, and prayed for
themselves. For the Just shall live by his faith; and it is a great vanity in
some great Papists, who presume to live loosely and basely, because they have
hired some hedg-Priest to say a certain number of prayers for them daily.

For him will I accept] scil. Through the Office and person of my Son, which
herein he resembles. The Highpriests Office was, 1. To expiate the sins of
the people. 2. To intercede and make request for them. Christ is the
High Priest of the New Testament; in whom the Father is well pleased, and
through whom he will deny nothing to his humble Suppliants, for themselves or
others.

Lest I deal with you after your folly] Heb. Lest I work foolishness with you;
that is, (says Beza) lest I so behave my self toward you, as your foolishness
does deserve. Or, lest I so handle you, that you may think me no wiser then I
should be since you have seemed so to rough-hew Job out of zeal to me. Thus to
the froward God seems to deal frowardly, Psalm. 18.27. Tremellius renders it
not folly but heinous offense; others, disgrace. Mercer.


In that ye have not spoken, etc.] And if for hard words and ill language, good
men may suffer, Flagitium, ignominia.
what shall become of such, as both with virulent tongues, and violent hands,
set against such as fear God?

Verse 9. So Eliphaz the Temanite, etc.] Here was resipiscentia ex fide
constans says Brentius, the repentance of faith, the obedience also of says
readily y^ilded. Had not these been good and godly men, they would have stuck
at the cost of so great a Sacrifice, they would also have scorned to have
sought to Job, whom they had so much slighted, and to beg his prayers of whom
they had so ill deserved. But hey had not so learned Christ. God they saw well
was greatly offended, and Job highly accepted; glad therefore were they by any
good means to ingratiate, each of them saying to God for himself, as he did

The Lord also accepted Job] Whether he testifies his good acceptance by
consuming his Sacrifice with fire from heaven, is uncertain. It Is enough for us
to know that he showed himself reconciled unto them, and well pleased with Jobs
prayer for them, and their own prayers joined no doubt with his, and proceeding
from faith in the Merits and Mediation of Jesus Christ. And hitherto Gods
de^isive sentence, whereby all the strife was graciously ended, and all parties
happily and heartily reconciled. What became of Satan a chief Actor in this
Tragedy, we read not; Victus enim abiit. And as God would not once call him to
account, when he had beguiled our first parents, Genesis 3. because he meant him
no mercy: so here he never mentions him, as being judged already, and by Job
bravely worsted and defeated. All that we find of him is, that his commission
to vex Job any farther, was now taken away, for so it follows

Verse 10. And the Lord turned again the Captivity of Job] He took him out of
Satan's clutches, who had hitherto held him prisoner, as it were in the bands of
poverty, sickness, sorrow, contempt, distress, etc. Whether all at once, or by
degrees, God did all this for him, it skills not. Upon his prayers for his
friends (which was no small evidence and effect of his Piety and Charity) it
appears; that God did all this that follows for him. So true is that of
Solomon, The reward of humility, and of the fear of the Lord, is riches, and
honor, and life, Prove. 22.4.

When he prayed for his friends] According to that of the Apostle Paul, Being
defamed we pray. This is an high degree of Christian perfection, which but few
attain unto, as Merlin here bewaileth it; O raram and singularem virtutem, etc.
And another well observes, That God gives and forgives, according as man
forgives his neighbor.

Also the Lord gave Job twice as much, etc.] Understand it both of Goods and
Graces; which though he never parted with, yet by trial and experience he found
them much increased. As for outward things it is nothing unusual for men to
recover and recruit as far as God sees fit. Multadies vari^squo Labor
mutabilis avi
Rettulit in melius: multos alterna revisens
Lusit, and in solido rursus fortuna locavit. Virg. Aen. l. 11

The best way is to hang loose to these things below, not trusting in uncertain
riches, but in the living God, 1 Timothy 6.17. who will be our exceeding great
reward, and give to his Sufferers an hundred fold here, and eternal life
hereafter, Mat. 19.29. Optand^ nimirum est jactura quae lucro majore pensatur,
says Agricola. It is doubtless a lovely loss that is made up with so much
gain. Well might Saint Paul say. Godliness is profitable to all things, as
having the Promise of both lives, 1 Timothy 4 6 Well might Saint Peter call it,
The Divine Nature, 2 Pet. 1.2 For as God brings light out of darkness, comfort
out of sorrow, riches out of poverty, etc. so does Godliness. Let a man, with
Job, bear his losses patiently and pray for his enemies that wrong and rob him,
and he shall be sure to have his own again, and more, either in money or
moneys worth, either in the same or a better thing: contented Godliness shall
be great gain to him, 1 Timothy 6.6. Besides heavens happiness, which shall make
a plentiful amends for all. The Rabbis would persuade us, That God
miraculously brought back again to Job the self-same cattle, that the Sabaeans
and others had taken from him, and doubled them. Indeed his children, (say
they) therefore were not doubled unto him, because they perished by their ow^
^ault and folly, as one of his friends also told him. But of all this nothing
certain can be affirmed: and they do better who say, That his children being
dead in Gods favor, perished not, but went to heaven; they were not lost but
laid up; so that, before God, Job had the number of his children doubled: for
they are ours still, whom we have sent to heaven before us; and Christ at his
coming shall restore them unto us, 1 Thessal. 4.14. In confidence whereof
faithful Abraham calls his deceased Sarah, his dead; That I may bury my dead
out of my sight Genesis 23.4. and so she is called eight several times in that one
Chapter, as Paraeus has observed.

Verse 11 Then came there unto him all his brethren] Then; when God had begun
to restore him. As his adversity had scattered his friends, so his prosperity
brought them together again. This is the worlds usage. Dum fueris foelix multos
numerabis amicos:
Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris.
Summer-birds there are not a few: Samaritans, who would own the Jews whiles
they flourished; but otherwise disavow them; as they did to Antiochus
Epiphanes: Rich Job had many friends, Prove. 14.20. Qui tamen persistebant
amicitia sicut lepus juxta tympanum, as the Proverb is. All this good Job
passes by, and forgetting all unkindnesses, magnificently treats them; as
Isaac in like case, had done Abimelech and his train, Genesis 26.30.

And did eat bread with him in his house] It Is likely they came with their cost
to make Job a Feast of comfort, such as were usual in those days, Jer. 16.7.
Ezekiel 24.17. But whether they did or not, they were welcome to Job; who now
never upbraids them with their forsaking of him in his distress (which yet was
then a great grief to him) but friendly re-embraceth them, and courteously
entertaineth them. This is contrary to the practice of many fierce and
implacable spirits in these days, whose wrath, like that of the Athenians, is
(...), long-lasting; and although themselves are mortal, yet their hearts are
immortal.

And they bimoaned him] They condoled with him, and shook their heads, as the
word signifies; not by way of deriding him, as once they had done, chap. 16.
but of sorrow for their former deserting him, and assurance that they would
henceforth better stick to him in what estate soever.

And comforted him over all the evil etc.] So they should have done long
before: A friend is made for the day of adversity; but better late then never.
Nunquam sane sero si serio. See here. says Brentius, the change of affairs,
and the right hand of the Most High, and learn the fear of God; for as he
frowneth or favors any man, so will the world do.

Every man also gave him a piece of money] Or, a Lamb to stock him again. Beza
renders it, Some one of his Cattle, and paraphraseth thus: Yea, every one of
them gave him either a sheep or an Ox, or a Camel, and also an Ear-ring of
gold; partly as a pledge of their good will and friendship renewed toward him,
and partly in consideration and recompense of that loss, which he had before
by the will and fore-appointment of God sustained. Honoraria obtulerunt, says
Junius, they brought him these presents as Pledges of their love and
observance; for so were great men wont to be saluted with some gift, Sen.
Epist. 17.
1 Samuel 10.27. 2 Chronicles. 17.5. And the same custom was among the Persians and
Parthians, whose Kings might not be met without some token of congratulation,
and Symbol of Honor.

And every one an Ear-ring of gold] Inaurem auream, an Ear-pendant of gold, at
the Receipt whereof, Job might well say as the Poet did, Theog.
(...).
To thee this is a small matter, but to me a great.


Verse 12. So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job] According to Bildads
Prophecy, chap. 8.7. And S. James his useful observation, Chap. 5.11. Ye have
heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord
is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. If he afflict any of his, it is in very
faithfulness, that he may be true to their souls, it is also in great mercy,
Deuteronomy. 8.16.
that he may do them good in the latter end; and this they themselves also
shall both see and say, by that time he has brought both ends together, Psalm.
119.71. Be ye therefore patient, stablish your hearts, James 5.7. Patient Job
had all doubled to him. Joseph of a Slave became his Masters Master.
Valentinian lost his Tribuneship for Christ, but was afterward made Emperor.
Queen Elizabeth of a prisoner, became a great Princess. But if God deny his
suffering servants Temporals, and give them in Spirituals, they have no Cause
to complain: One way or other they shall be sure to have it. Great is the gain
of Godliness.

For he had fourteen thousand sheep, etc] Cattle only are instanced; Pecuma a
pec^de. (...) pecudes. and postea opes significant. Melancth. Dios
because therein especially consisted the wealth of that Country; but other
good things also doubtless were doubled unto him, as his family, possessions,
grounds, houses, and especially Wisdom to make a good use of all: for commonly
Stultitiam patiuntur opes; and what is more contemptible then a rich fool, a
golden beast, as Caligula called his father in Law Syllanus.

Verse 13. He had also seven sons, and three daughters] Whose perfections
sweetened the sorrow which the loss of the other had caused him. -- Sic uno
avulso non deficit alter Aureus. Virg.
Ten children he had in heaven, and ten on earth. See the Note above on verse.
10. The Lord well knew that wealth would be nothing so comfortable to Job.
unless he had children to leave it to, Genesis 15.2. His wife therefore returning
to her duty from which she had swerved, became fruitful at an age well
advanced; for we read not of any other that he had.

Ver. 14. And he called the name of the first, Jemimah] That is, Day-bright,
from her orient and glistering beauty; q.d. fair as they day: Cant. 6.10. the
Church is said, Diurn^.
to look forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon.

And the name of the second, Kezia] That is, Cassia; a kind of Spice, whereof
there are three sorts, says Dioscorides but all very sweet, and send forth a
most pleasant smell, like that of the Rose. This second daughter therefore
seems to be so named from the sweetness of her breath, or perhaps of her
whole body, proceeding from the goodness of her constitution, as it is
reported of Alexander the Great. So sweet smelling Smyrna, the best of all the
seven Churches of Asia, Revel. 3.

And the name of the third, Keren-happuch] That is, the Horn of beauty, (better
then that which is borrowed) and of abundance; as whose cheeks Nature had
painted with a most pleasing Vermillion, far beyond any artificial tincture,
which she had no need of, Vtpote omnes aliarum fucos and veneres superans. Some
intepret it, the horn of conversion; and think, That Job herein would express
and memorize the strange turn and alteration of his condition, as Joseph did,
Genesis 41.51, 52. Vatab.
But the Chaldee Paraphrast, the Jew-Doctors, and most of our Expositors, are
for the former Interpretation, favored also by the words following:

Verse 15. And in all the Land there were no women found so (...), etc.] (...)
though but a (...) fragile, and one of the gifts of Gods left hand, Prove. 3.16,
(...) is it the Flower of virtue, as Chrysippus called it; one of the greatest
excellencies of Nature, and singular degree of Gods Image in man, as Another.
Plat^.
And although virtue is -- Proprio contenta theatro, yet to others Gratior est
pulchro veniens in corpore virtus.
That Virtue has a better grace.
That shines from a beauteous face.
Such probably were Jobs Daughters, not fair and foolish, as those Daughters of
Jerusalem, Isai. 3. but adorned with all variety of Moral virtues, as a clear
Sky is with Stars, as a Princely Diadem with Jewels. Hence their good father
so affected them, that he

Gave them inherit^^^^s among their brethren] Making them coheires with them in
his estate, which as it was an extraordinary expression of his love to his
daughters; so it imports, as some think, a desire in him to have his
daughters live still with him amongst the rest of his family: either for that
he was loath to part with them, Val. Max. Christian page 308
(the like whereof is reported of Charles the Great, who being asked, Why he
did not bestow his daughters in marriage, answered, That he could not be at all
without their company) or else as fearing lest they should be defiled with
Idolaters, which peradventure, out of Jobs family, were ordinary in that
Country.

Verse 16. Fliny tells of one Xenophilus, who lived 10^ years without sickness
Lib. 7 cap 5.
After this lived Job an hundred and forty years. etc.] And this was not the
least part of his happiness. Length of days is a piece of Wisdoms wages.
Prove. 3.16. And what a mercy, (...), or a good old age is, has been before
noted; See chap. 5.26. For a short braid of adversity, Job had an hundred and
forty years health and prosperity: Like as Joseph for his thirteen years of
slavery and imprisonment, had fourscore years liberty, prosperity and
preferment. Who would not serve thee, O King of Nations?

And saw his sons] Who doubtless were good and towardly (though nothing is said
of them) agreeable to their education, and answerable to Jobs former children,
chap. 1.

And his sons sons] To his great joys increase.

Even four generations] Joseph saw but three, Genesis 50.23. If God deny this
happiness to any of his, yet he has promised them a Name in his house better
then of Sons and Nephews, Isai. 56.5.

Verse 17 So Job died, being old and full of dayes] How long he lived, we know
not. The Rabbis say, above two hundred years, which was longer then either
Abraham or Isaac lived: of both whom it is likewise said, that they were saturi
dierum, sated with this earthly life, and desirous of life eternal. To those
old men that would yet live longer, we may say, Cur non ^t satur vitae conviva
recedis? Lucret.
It is enough, Lord, said Elias; I desire to be dissolved, said Paul: Go forth,
my soul, go forth to God, said Hilarion: What make I here, said Monica. Job is
now as willing to dye as ever he was to dine: he is satisfied with days, says
the text, not as a meat loathed, but as a dish, though well liked, that he had
fed his full of.

Laus Deo in Aeternum.
A COMMENTARY OR EXPOSITION Upon the Book of PSALMS.
THe Book of Psalms] So Christ calls it, Luke 20.42. the Hebrew word
signifies Hymns, or Praises; because the greater part of these Psalms serve to
set forth the praise of God. This title seems to be taken from Psalm. 145.
called David's Hymn, or Psalm of Praise; so highly prized by the ancient
Hebrews, that they pronounce him an Heir of Heaven, who shall three times a day
devoutly repeat it. Athanas. Chrysostom.
The Greeks call this Book the Psalter; and deservedly give it many high
commendations; as that it is the Souls Anatomy, the Laws Epitomy, the Gospels
Index, the Garden of the Scriptures, a sweet Field and Rosary of Promises,
Precepts, Predictions, Praises, Soliloquies, etc. the very Heart and Soul of
God, the Tongue and Pen of David, a man after Gods own heart; one murmur of
whose Michtam, or Maschil, one touch of whose heavenly Harp is far above all
the buskind Raptures, garish Phantasms, splendid Vanities, Pageants, and
Landskips of prophaner wits; far better worthy to be written in letters of
Gold, than Pindars seventh Ode in the Temple at Rhodes (though Politian judged
otherwise, like a Wretch as he was) and far more fit to have been laid up, as
a rare and precious Jewel, in that Persian Casket, embroydered with Gold and
Pearl, than Homers Iliads, for which it was reserved by great Alexander. But
that Cock on the Dunghill never knew the worth of this peerless Pearl; as did
our good King Alured, who himself translated the Psalter into his own Saxon
Tongue; Turk. His
and as the Emperor Andronicus, who caused this Book to be bound up in a
little Volume by it self, to serve as his Manual, and attend him in his running
Library: for therein he found amulets of comfort, more pleasant than the Pools
of Heshbon, more glorious than the Tower of Lebanon, more redolent than the Oil
of Aaron, more fructifying than the dew of Hermon, as one expresses it. All
the latitude of the Holy Scriptures may be reduced to the Psalms, says Austin,
after Athanasius; Luther calls them Parva Biblia, and summarium utriusque
Testaments, a little Bible, a Summary of both Testaments. The Turks disclaim
both the Old and New Testament, and yet they swear as solemnly by the Psalms of
David, as by the Alchoran of Mahomet. Anciently they were sung in the Temples,
and in the Primitive Christian Church happy was that tongue held that could
sound out aliquid Davidicum, any part of a Psalm of David, Nicephorus tells
us, that as they traveled and journied they used to solace themselves with
Psalms, and that thereby there was at a certain time a Jew converted. Saint
Paul calls them Spiritual Songs, Col. 3.16. both because they were indicted by
the Holy Spirit; and for that they do singularly suit with men's spirits; for
they are so penned that every man may think they speak De se, in re sua, of
himself, and to his particular purpose, as Athanasins observes. And lastly,
because they do after a special manner Spiritualize, and sanctify those that
sing them in the right tune; which is, Sing with grace in your hearts unto the
Lord, as the Apostle there sets it; and elsewhere hinteth unto us, that
there is no small edification by the choice of a fit Psalm, 1 Cor. 14.26.

Verse. 1. Blessed] Heb. O the blessedness, the heaped up happiness both of this
Life, and a better, fitter to be believed than possible to be discoursed. The
Hebrew comes from a root that signifies to go right forward, scil. in the way
that is called Holy, having Oculum ad metam, an eye upon the mark, viz. True
and real happiness, such as all men pretend to, but he only attaineth to who is
here described. Policrat. lib. 8. cap. 4.
Sylla was by his flatterers surnamed Felix, because high and mighty; and
Metellus likewise, Quod bona multa bono, modo invenerat, because rich by right
means. But he that first called Riches Bona was a better Husband than Divine;
and they that seek for a felicity in any thing here below, seek for the living
among the dead. The Philosophers discourses of this subject are but learned
dotages; David says more to the point in this short Psalm, than any, or all of
them put together; they did but beat the Bush, God has here put the Bird into
our hands.

Is the man] Heb. that man, with an Article, with an Accent, and by an
excellency, as Jer. 5.1. that eminent and eximious man, who is rationally
Spiritual, and Spiritually rational; that man in Christ, 2 Cor. 12.2. who has
learned Christ, and does live Christ, walking as he walked, 1 John 2.6. and not
in the counsel of the ungodly, etc. But his delight is in the Law of the Lord,
etc. Magnus atque admirabilis vir, simodo viri nomine designare illum fas est,
as Chrysostom says of Babylas the Martyr, that is, a great and an admirable
man, if a man we may call him, and not an earthly Angel rather. He must indeed
be content to pass to Heaven as a concealed man, because the World knows him
not, 1 John 3.1. but those that have senses exercised to discern good and evil,
may easily know him, as he stands here described, 1 To depart from evil, verse.
1. 2 To do good, verse. 2.

Walks not in the counsel of the ungodly] or restless; the counsel of such
should be far from us, Job 21.16. and 22.18. The Jews cast their whole Nation
of People into three ranks, Reshagnim (the word here used) that is, the profane
rabble. Tsadichim, righteous men, and Chasidim, good, or gracious men; see Romans
5.7. To these two latter are opposite here Sinners, and Scorners; these last
being the worst of wicked persons, (...) Prove. 20.1. (...). Prove. 9.12. (...).
Prove. 3.34. (...) Psalm. 119.51. (...) Panormit.
and therefore set last in this gradation, as some will have it. The Septuagint
here render them Pests or Botches, and elsewhere incorrigible, wicked (with a
witness) proud, prevaricating, etc. Beware of this Sin, says Father Latimer;
for I never knew but one scorner that repeuted: he who is fitten down in this
Chair or Pestilence (as having tired himself in ways of wickedness, and will
not be better advised, Prove. 9.7, 8. but with Lots Sons in Law, jeareth what
he should fear) will not easily be raised out of it.

Verse. 2. But his delight is in the Law of the Lord] i.e. in the whole Doctrine
of the Holy Scriptures, that invariable rule of truth, as Irenaeus rightly
calls it. He finds rest no where, Nisi in angulo cum libello, in a Nook
with this Book, as Thomas a Kempis was wont to say, who also with his own hand
wrote out the Bible. King Alphonsus read it over fourteen times, together with
such Commentaries as those times afforded. Luther said, he would not live in
Paradise without the Word, Par. in Epist. ad Ja. N^wer. Pastor. Heidelb.
as with it he could live well enough in Hell. Magdalen Wife to D. Paraeus,
after she was married, and forty years of age, out of love to the Scriptures
learnt to read, and took such delight in it, and especially in the Psalms, that
she gat them almost all by heart. B^za being above fourscore years old, could
say perfectly by heart any Greek Chap. Act. and Mon.
in St. Paul's Epistles. Cranmer and Ridley had all the New Testament by heart;
the former had learnt it in his journey to Rome, the latter in the Walks of
Pembrook-Hall in Cambridge.

And in his Law does he meditate day and night]

Hoc primus repetens opus, hoc postremus omittens; Hora
Having gathered with the Bees the sweet of those heavenly flowers, he does by
meditation work his Honeycomb within his Hive; and at this work he is perdius
and pernox, till he feel it to become an ingrafted word, yea till he has
turned it in succum and sanguinem, and is after a sort transformed into it, 2
Cor. 3.18. The Hebrew word Hagah here signifies both to speak with the mouth,
and with the heart, to read, and to meditate; because to read is not to run
over a Chapter, as a Child at School, but to muse upon the matter, and to make
some benefit of it. It is storied of Pythagoras, that he lived in a Cave for a
whole year together, that being sequestered from the society of men, he might
the better meditate upon the abstruser parts of Philosophy; he used also with a
thread to tie the hair of his head to a beam over him, that so when he did but
nod by reason of sleep, he might be awakened thereby. Is not this check to our
oscitancy and carelesnese of searching the Scriptures, and making them our
daily and nightly study? Hierom exhorted some godly women to whom he wrote,
Hier. ad E^^ De custed Virgin.
not to lay the Bible out of their hands, until being overcome with sleep, and
not able any longer to hold up their heads, they bowed them down, as it were to
salute the leaves below them with a kiss.

Verse. 3. And he shall be like a tree] An Olive Tree, say some, from Psalm.
52.8. which is green all the year, says Pliny; that in Noah's Flood kept its
greenness though it had been so long time under the water; and is therefore
made an Emblem of the Resurrection. Others will have it to be the Palm Tree,
from Psa. 92.12. Not. Hist. (...) 16. cap. 20. Genesis 8.11. Purch Pilgri v. 2. p.
1466
which likewise is always green, and very fruitful. Plutarch says, that the
Babylonians make three hundred and sixty Commodities of it. The Tree whereon
the Coquonuts grow in the Indies, is said to be such, as where with alone a
ship may be built, and furnished to Sea with Meat and Merchandise. Let it be
what tree it will that is here meant, if Plato could say, that Man in a tree
inverted, with the root above, and the branches below, and that he is (...),
and heavenly Plant, Plato. Homer.
(...), as another has it; Much more may we say so of a godly man, that Plant
of renown, rooted in Christ, and fruited by the Spirit, of a right
constitution, and righteous conversation, Gal. 5.25. See Jer. 17.8. Ezekiel
47.12.

Planted by the rivers of water] In locis irriguis, in moist places, where most
trees thrive best; understand it of those waters of the Sanctuary, Ezekiel. 47.12.
together with those never-failing influences of grace and consolation that are
in him, as a Well of water bubling up to eternal life, Job. 4.14.

That brings forth his fruit in his season] There are no barren trees in Gods
Orchard, and yet they may have their fits of barrenness, as an Apple Tree
sometimes has: but they will re^flourish with advantage, as those Philippians
did, Chap. 4.10. (see the Note there) and bear fruit in the right season, Nec
praecocem nec serum. Now, every thing is beautiful in its season, Eccles. 5.11.
and it was no small shame to Achitophel, when it was told him by Hushai the
Archite, Thy counsel is good, but not n^w, 2 Samuel 17.7.

His leaf also shall not wither] Heb. fade, for want of sap or safety from
Christ the root; but as the Olive of Palm Tree, Semper in sue genere viret
vigetque retains its green leaf, and has for its Motto, Nec premor nec
perimor; so does the good Soul persevere and persist in the profession and
practice of the truth, which is after godliness, Tit. 1.1. Maugre the malice of
Earth, and of Hell. Plin. l. 12. cap. 11. Aug. de C. (...) lib. 21. cap. (...)
Of Tylos an Indian Island Pliny and Austin say. That no tree therein growing
does at any time of the year lose their leaves. Certain it is, that saving
faith cannot be lost altogether, though it may suffer some decays, Isa. 6.13.

And whatsoever he does shall prosper] So Josh. 1.7, 8. This, and the like
Promises must be understood with an exception of the Cross, as need requires,
1 Pet. 1.6. Gain, his prosperity, that of the Soul I mean, he shall be sure of,
Romans 8.28.37. Temporal also, so far as may make for his etenal good. Pintus out
of Pliny tells us, That the Palm Tree will not grow well in a fat ground, but
in a light an sandy; and that if the foyl be strong and fertile, they must cast
salt and ashes at the root to qualify the strength of the ground. As Christ is
the true Vine, so his Father is a good Husbandman, and knows well how to
order his trees of righteousness: but usually Piety has prosperity, an is
profitable to all things, 1 Timothy 4.8. And outward prosperity, if it follow
close walking with God, is very sweet; as the Cipher when it follows the
Figure, adds to the Number, though it be nothing in it self.

Verse. 4. The ungodly are not so] Not like any such tree before described, but
rather like the Cypress-tree, which the more it is watered, is the less
fruitful: or like the Cyparit-tree, whereof Pliny writes, that it is good for
nothing, no not for show, shadow, or smell. Saint Jude says, They are trees
indeed, but such as are twice dead, pulled up by the roots, verse. 12. Twice
dead they are said to be, 1. Because a Spiritual death is so great a death,
that it may well go for two. 2 Because those ungodly ones were dead, both in
regard of fruit and leaves, truth of grace, and any outward actings of grace.
Their fruit, if any, is but Hedge-fruit, their leaves of formal profession
wither, and come to nothing; if they prosper in the World, (as Sigonius
observes of Pope Zachary that he dyed, Rebus non tam pie quam prospere gestis,
Not over-pious, and yet every prosperous) it is that they may be cut down for
ever, Psalm. 37.2. such a temporary prosperity. Plus deceptionis habet quam
delectationis, says Lactantius, is more deceitful than delightful, and is
therefore well called by Bernard, Misericordia omni indignatione crudelior, a
gift-less gift, etc.

But are like the chaff] Not so they are, but much worse in many respects, as
it is fit they should be. God will surely set a difference, Mal. 3. ult. See
the note there. A profane Soldier at the siege of a Town, passing a place of
danger was heard swearing, and when one that stood by warned him, saying,
Fellow Soldier, do not Swear, the bullets fly; he answered, They that swear
come off as well as they that pray: But what came of it? Soon after a Shot hit
him, and down he fell. The wicked is (as chaff) driven away in his wickedness:
but the righteous has hope in his death, Prove. 14.32. The word here rendered
Chaff, is Palea tenuissima and minutissime contrita, chaft beaten to dust, and
therefore good for nothing, but apt to be whiffled up and down with every wind
of Doctrine, with every puff of temptation. A good man is, as a tree, steadfast,
and unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, 1 Cor. 15. ult. An
evil man as chaff, light and worthless, Religionem habens Ephemeram, constant
in nothing so much as in his inconstancy, serves God by fits and starts, flies
in his face when afflicted, as chaff does in the face of the Winnower; whiles
the weightier Corn falls low at his feet. See Job 21.18. (...) steris. trent.
Psalm. 55.5. Hos. 13.3. Mat. 3.12. with the notes.

Verse. 5. Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgement] i. e. Causa
cadent and damnabun^ur; at the Great Assizes they shall be cast and condemned.
Revel. 6.17. For the great day of his Wrath is come, and who shall be able to
stand? If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the
sinner appear? 1 Pet. 4.18. Surely no where, but in Hell, their own place, Acts
1.25. not before God, for he is a consuming fire, Heb. 12. ult. and they chaff,
or stubble fully dried. See Isa. 33.14. Not before Christ, for he shall come in
flaming fire rendering vengeance, etc. 2 Thessalonians. 1.7. not in Heaven, for it is an
undefiled inheritance, neither may any dirty Dog trample on that golden
pavement, Revel. 22.15. Not any longer on Earth, defiled by their iniquities,
and therefore to be purged by the fire of the last Day: for the earth also,
and the works that are therein shall be burnt up, 2 Pet. 3.10. R. David Kimchi
by Judgment here, understands the day of the wicked man's death; and indeed
his Deaths-day is his Doomesday, when he must take a fearful farewell, and
breath out his Soul and hope together with the breath of the same dying groan,
Job. 27.8. and 11.20. Hinc illae Lachrymae, hence that loth-to-depart, though
some set a good face upon it when to dye, as Sir Thomas Moore, who dyed for the
Popes Supremacy with a light jest in his mouth; Vespasian likewise dyed with a
jest, and Augustus in a Complement. This was but the Hypocrisy of mirth: for
Death is the King of terror to a Natural man. See Heb. 2.15. 1 Samuel 15.32. and
28.20. Saul at the message of death swooned quite away, and fell all along,
Quantus quantus erat, as Peter Martyr phraseth it; yea good Hezekiah wept when
sentenced to death, and the approach of it was to him Mar mar, bitter
bitterness, Isa. 38.3.17. he must have his faith at his fingers ends, as one
says, that will dye actively. But all men have not faith, 2 Thessalonians. 3.2. and
those few that have, are not always assured that their hearts shall live for
ever, as Psalm. 22.26. and that Death, the Devils Sergeant to drag wicked men to
Hell, shall be to them the Lords Gentleman Usher to conduct them to Heaven; as
Mr. Brightman expresses it.

Nor Sinners in the Congregation of the righteous] They shall never set foot
within heavens Threshold, within that general Assembly, that sacred Panegyris,
ample Amphitheatre, the Congregation-house of crowned Saints, and glorious
Angels. Tertullian says of Pompies Theater (which was the greatest ornament of
old Rome) that it was Arx omnium turpitudinum, a receptacle of all kind of
Ribaldry and Roguery. Not so Heaven; There shall in no wise enter into it any
thing that defiles, neither whatsoever works abomination, or makes a lie,
Rev. 21.27. Augustine.
The Irish air will sooner brook a Toad, or a Snake, than Heaven a Sinner. Mali
in area nobiscum esse possunt, in horreo non possunt, Chaff may be with Gods
good Corn on the floor, but in the Garner it shall not. For Christ will
thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his Wheat into the Garner, but will burn
up the chaff with unquenchable fire, Mat. 3.12.

Verse. 6. For the Lord knows the way of the righteous] Or, acknowledges,
approves, administreth, and orders all things to their eternal Salvation; as
may appear by the opposition, wherein there is a Rhetorical Aposiopesis. Gods
knowledge of men and their ways is not merely Intuitive, but Approbative of the
good, and Vindictive of the evil; (...) His Providence (which is the carrying
on of his Decree) is that helm which turns about the wholeship of the Universe
with singular skill and justice. Dominus diligit, and dirigit viam, id est,
vitam and omne institutum justorum. See Psalm. 37.18. and 142.4. Nahum 1.7.
Prove. 2.8. with the notes there. God knows the righteous by name, Exodus 33.17.
knows them for his own, looks upon them and their whole course with singular
delight and complacency; they are his Hephzibah, Isa. 62.4. the dearly beloved
of his Soul, Jer. 12.7. Verba notitiae apud Hebraos secum trahunt affectum.

But the way of the ungodly shall perish] Their practices and persons shall
perish together, be done away, be lost for ever. And why? because the Lord
knows them not; unless it be for black Sheep, as we say, or rather for
reprobate Goats, Mat. 25. Hence their Souls are flung out, as out of the middle
of a sling, when the Souls of the Saints are bound up in the bundle of life,
with the Lord their God, 1 Samuel 25.29.

PSALM. II.
Verse. 1 Why do the Heathen rage?] Why? or for what? The Psalm begins
abruptly, with an angry interrogation, q.d. What? are they mad to attempt such
things, as whereof they can neither give any good reason, nor expect any good
effect? The Lord Christ of whom David was both a Father and a Figure, (as here
appears) shall surely reign, maugre all the rage and resistance of his
enemies, who may seem to be ambitious of their own destruction, and are
therefore in this Psalm schooled, and counseled to desist. Nothing is more
irrational than irreligion; Why do the Heathen tumultuously rage, or hurtle
together, Fremunt and ferociunt? When the Philistines heard that David was made
King in Hebron, they came up to seek him, and to unking him, 2 Samuel 5.17. so
the Heathen and People, that is, Gentiles and Jews would have dealt by Christ,
Acts 4.25, 26. The Devil ever since he was cast out of Heaven, tumultuateth,
and keeps ado; so do unruly spirits acted and agitated by him. Dan. 6.15.
Then those men kept a stir with the King against Daniel; it is the same Hebrew
word that is here, and possibly Daniels spirit might think of David's terms.
John 11.33. Jesus troubled himself, but after another manner than these his
enemies; his passions were without mud, as clear water in a Crystal Glass;
what was an act of power in Christ, is an act of weakness, if not of
wickedness, in others. (...) Acts 4.25.
The Apostles Greek word for this in the text denotes rage, pride, and
fierceness, as of Horses that Neigh, and rush into the Battle.

And the people imagine] Heb. meditate, or mutter a vain thing, an empty
design, that shall come to noting.

Niteris incassum Christi submergere puppem:
Fluctuat, at nunquam mergitur illaratis.
Dipped may the Churches Ship be, but not drowned;
Christ will not fail her enemies to confound.
Some think that by this, muttering people are meant, such as act not open
outrages against Christ; but yet in words murmur and mutiny, whispering Treason.

Verse. 2. The Kings of the earth set themselves] Or, stand up, as if they would
do the deed, and bear down all before them. The many had acted their part,
verse. 1. and now the mighties show themselves, but go off again with shame
enough. The Spanish Friar used to say, there were but few Princes in Hell; and
why? because there were but few in all. It was a poor comfort to our Henry 8.
to be told upon his Deathbed, That he was now going to the place of Kings.
Some such there have been as proved nursing Fathers to the Church, and
propagated the Kingdom of Christ in their Generations, Esa. 49.33. but what a
vain vaunt was that of those bloody Tyrants in the Primitive times, who sounded
the Triumph beforehand, and thus engraved the Victory upon pillars of Marble,
Nomine Christianorum deleto qui Remp. evertebant? What was all this, but a
blaze before their last Light went out? or like some bulging wall that was
swollen immediately before it fell? have any ever yet waxed fierce against Christ
and prospered? Job 9.4.

And the Rulers take counsel together] Or, have laid their foundation: for
counsel is to action, Syncretism^m incunt, and quasi se funda^t consiliis suis,
etc.
says Aben-Ezra here, the same that the foundation is to a building. The
Chaldee has it, they consociate to rebel before the Lord, and to fight against
his Anointed. But with what success, see Isa. 8.9, 10. Immanuel will
over-match them.

Verse. 3. Let us break their bands asunder, etc.) Here these Rebels are brought
in, proclaming their treasonable Decrees against Christ, and his adherents, who
seek to promote his Kingdom. Resolved they were to run riot, as lawless and
awless, and therefore they slander the sweet Laws of Christ's Kingdom, as bonds
and thick cords (those signs of slavery, Jer. 27.2, 6, 7.) as burdens, and
grievances. Melch. Adam in vit. Bucer.
So the Popish Clergy of Collen told their good Archbishop Albert (who had
made use of Bucer and Melancthon to bring things into better order) that they
had rather live under the Turkish Government, than under such a Reformation.
But what says our Savior? My yoke is easy, and my burden light: No more
burden it is to a regenerate person, than the wings are to the Bird. He
delights in the Law of God after the inward man, Romans 7. It is not to him
now, as once, bands and cords, but as Girdles and Garters, which gird up his
loins, and expedite his course the better. It confineth him to live in that
element where he would live; as if one should be confined to Paradise, where he
would be, though there were no such Law.

Verse. 4. He that sits in the Heavens shall laugh at them] Videt, ridet: He
sees and smileth, he looks and laugheth at these Giants. He sits in
Heaven far above their reach; neither does he much trouble himself about the
matter. No more should we; but trust in him, and know that there is a Council
in Heaven that will dash the mould of all contrary Counsels upon Earth; as the
stone cut out of the Mountain did the Four great Monarchies, Dan. 2.34. See an
instance hereof in latter times. Luther, that Heroical Reformer was
Excommunicated by the Pope, proscribed by the Emperor, hated and cursed all
Christendom over almost, yet he prospered, and the Work of Christ went on in
his hands. And when the Elector of Saxony (his only Patron) was much afraid
what would become of him, and of the business of Religion, Luther out of his
Pathmus (as he called it) where he lay hid, writes him a rousing Letter,
wherein is read this among many other brave passages; Sciat Celsitudo tua and
nihil dubitet long aliter in coelo quam Noribergae de hoc negotio conclusum
est, Let your Highness rest well assured of this, that things are far otherwise
carried, and concluded of in Heaven, than they are at the Imperial Diet held at
Norinberg. After this, in the year of Grace, one thousand five hundred twenty
six, there conspired against the Gospel, and the Professors thereof, the
Emperor and his Prisoner in Spain, the French King, the Princes also, and
Bishops in Germany, stirred up by the Pope. The French King was set at liberty,
upon condition to join with the Emperor to root out Lutheranism, that is, true
Religion. This was the agreement, but God brake it, for the French King was no
sooner come home, but he made a League with the Pope, and the Venetians,
against the Emperor. The Pope excuses his falling off from Caesar by a
petulant and malapert Epistle. Caesar by another Letter ^ays open to the World
the Popes perfidy, exhorting him to peace, and concluding, that they had more
need to unite their Forces for the extirpation of Lutheran Heresy, etc. By
this means the Church had an happy Halcyon, whiles these great ones were out,
and at it.

The Lord will have them in derision] Adonai, that is, the sustainer and
upholder of all. Christ is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, Rev. 19.16. Lords
and Losels are all his vassals and underlings, as Constantine, Theodosius, and
Valentine, those great Emperors called themselves. This Name or Style Christ
has written on his Vesture, that all may see it, and on his Thigh, where hangs
his Sword, to show his absolute Dominion, his illimited Empire, got and held
out of the hands of his enemies, with his Sword, and with his Bow, as Genesis
48.22. And when he is said to deride them, this is more than to laugh at them,
as the following effects show.

Verse. 5. Then shall he speak unto them, etc.] Hep. He shall tell them, viz. a
piece of his mind, to their small comfort. As a great Prince sitting on a
lofty Throne, rateth his Rebels when once he has brought them before him, and
pronounces sentence upon them in fierce wrath. See Jer. 52.9. so will the King
of Heaven do by his sturdy refractories. Whether he will speak unto them by his
words, or by his rods, Job 33.14, 19, 20, 21. and when he will do it, he has
reserved in his own power and pleasure, Acts 1.7. but sooner or later he will
not fail to do it; and Poena venit gravior, quo mage seravenit.

And vex them] Or trouble them, as he did the Babel-builders, Pharaoh,
Sennacherib, others: Either by horror of Conscience, or corporal Plagues, one
way or other he will have his penny-worths of them, as he had of the old and
late Persecutors of his people.

Verse. 6. Yet have I set my King] Heb. And I have set, Heb. I have anointed;
where the sign of his inauguration, or entrance into his Kingdom, is put for
the possession and enjoying thereof. David was anointed by Gods appointment.
Christ was also anho^^ted and appointed by his Father, to the Office and work
of a Mediator; and is therefore here called his King. And, is here a sign of
indignation stirred.

Upon mine holy hill of Zion] David's strong Hold, and a Figure of the Church;
Heb. 12.22. Rev. 14.1. Isa. 60.14. as being the Seat of the Kingdom and
Sanctuary. Out of Zion also went forth the Law; and the Word of the Lord out of
Jerusalem, Isa. 2.3. it signifies a Watchtower: In the Church Christ, Angels,
Ministers, common Christians, watch against enemies visible and invisible.

Verse. 7. I will declare the decree] that irrevocable decree of the Father, for
the setting up of his Sons Scepter contra gentes, point blank opposite to that
decree of theirs, verse. 3. This Ordinance or Decree of his, Christ is still
declaring in his Church by the Ministers of the Gospel, whose Office it is to
set forth Christ to the world in all his Offices and Efficacies, and to bring
as many as may be to the obedience of the faith.

Thou art my Son] David was so by Adoption, and Acceptance, Psalm. 89.26, 27.
But Christ, I By eternal generation, Prove. 8. Heb. 1.5. 2 By hypostatical
union, and so God had one only Son (as Abraham had his Isaac) though otherwise
he were the Father of many Nations.

This day have I begotten thee] Understand it either of the day of Eternity, or
else of the fullness of time wherein God brought his first begotten Son into the
world, and afterward mightily declared him to be the Son of God by the
Resurrection from the dead, Romans 1.3. Acts 13.33. whence he is called the first
begotten of the dead, Col. 1.18. Rev. 1.5.

Verse. 8. Ask of me, and I will give thee] All things were conveyed to Christ
by asking: Shall we think to have any thing without asking? Or, are we not
worthily miserable that will not make our selves happy by asking? Now, through
Christ's Passion, and Intercession, it is but ask and have: Open thy mouth, and
I will fill it. If at any time we ask and miss, it is for most part because we
ask amiss, (...). 4.2.

The Heathen for thine inheritance] The Kingdom of Grace, (the object whereof
are all Nations) Christ has by Donation from his Father: for his Natural
Kingdom he has as God coaequal with his Father from all eternity.

Verse. 9. Thou shall roughly rule them. Ainsw:
Thou shall break them, etc.] sc. those that will not bend, thou shall thus
break. Christ's gracious Government of his obedient people, though not so fully
expressed here, yet is to be necessarily understood; and in the last words of
the Psalm it is plainly held forth, Blessed are all they that trust in him.

Thou shall dash them in pieces (or, scatter them abroad, being already broken)
as a Potters vessel] i.e. without any hope of repair and recovery. It is a
fearful thing to fall into the punishing hands of the living God, Heb. 10. He
that will not be warned in hearing, shall be crushed to pieces in feeling, said
that Martyr, Aut faciendum aut patiendum, God will be obeyed either actively,
or passively. Look to it.

Verse. 10. Be wise now therefore O ye Kings] Redeem your own sorrows, by
trembling at Gods Judgments, whiles they hang in the threatenings: this is an
high point of heavenly wisdom.

Ergo Dei tandem verbo subsoribite reges:
Ne rapiant Stygiae vos Acherontis aqua.
These Kings were not without wit and learning; Julian the Apostate for
instance (who said unto the King Christ, Apostato) but they wanted godly
wisdom, and are therefore here called upon to behave themselves prudently, and
to play the wise men. For as wicked men are fools in print: so on the contrary,
in our old English Books, a righteous man is printed a right wise man, and
righteousness right-wiseness. For it is the only true both Wisdom, Psalm.
111.10. Prove. 1.7. and Honor, for the righteous are Princes in all Lands,
Psalm. 45.16. yea they are Kings. Compare Mat. 13.17. with Luke 10.25. Many
righteous, says the one, many Kings, says the other Evangelist.

Be instructed ye Judges] Be nurtured ye Sages; submit to Christ's Discipline,
acknowledge his Prophetical Office here, his Priestly, verse. 11. his Kingly, v.
12. Estote ligati, so Aben-Ezra renders it, Be ye bound, in opposition to
that evil decree of theirs, verse. 3. Let us break their bonds, etc. And this
they are advised to do forthwith, while it is called to day, Now therefore,
before God the Father vex you, God the Son bruise you, with his Iron mace.

Verse. 11. Serve the Lord with fear] Timore non servili sed amicali, with
reverence and godly fear, Heb. 12.28. Say to Christ as the people did to
Joshua, chap. 1.16. and as the Rulers and Elders of Israel did to John, 2 King.
10.5. We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shall bid us.

And rejoice before him with trembling] A strange mixture of contrary passions,
(for base fear has torment, 1 John 4.18.) but such as is usual with Gods
Servants, whose task it is to work out their salvation with fear and trembling,
Phil. 2.12. Agreeable whereunto is that of Bernard, Laetisimus sed non securi:
gandentes in Domino sed caventes a recidivo. Those good women went from Christ's
Sepulcher with fear and great joy. We should come to him in his Ordinances,
like affected.

Verse. 12. Kiss the Son] That Son of God, verse. 7. Bar is an Hebrew word also;
(see Prove. 31.2) as R. Abraham confesses, though other Rabbis deny it; and
therefore render this text. Osculamini pure, Kiss purely, and Osculamini eum
qui selectus est, Osculo homagii, as Samuel kissed Saul. 1 Samuel 10. (...) Genesis
41;40. Eusebius. Mortuus est Moses ad os Jehova. Maimonides. (...)
Kiss him who is selected, or set apart: Christ is Gods elect, Isa. 42.1. Mat.
12.14. Him men must kiss with a kiss of adoration and subjection, with a kiss
of faith and love, 1 Pet. 5.14. Kiss his holy Wounds, as Constantine did the
Eye of Paphnutius, that was bored out in Maximinus the Tyrants time; so shall
he kiss us with the kisses of his mouth, Cant. 1.1. and with his kisses suck
out the sting of death, and take away our souls with a kiss, as the Rabbis
from Deuteronomy. 34.5. say he did Moses his soul. The ancient Patriarks saluted
Christ afar off, and were interchangeably saluted by him, Heb. 11.13, for they
saw by faith him who is invisible, verse. 27. O get a Patriarks eye, study Moses
his Optics: for here the Northern Proverb is found true, Unkent unkist. Men
know not the Son of God, and therefore love him not, kiss him not, unless it be
Osculo Iscariotico, as the Traitor kissed him: See a lofty and lively
description of him, Heb. 1.2, 3.

Lest he be angry] For meek though he be as a Lamb, and will not break the
bruised Reed; yet so angry he can be, that the Kings and great ones shall be
glad to flee from the wrath of this Lamb, Rev. 6. who has feet like burning
brass, and eyes like flaming fire, Rev. 1. Plato says of the King of Bees,
that although he has no sting, yet he rules and governs his Commonwealth
with great severity and justice: So does the Lord Christ; and every good Soul
is ready to say as the Poet did, Ut mala nulla feram nisi nudam Caesaris iram,
Nuda parum nobis Caesaris ira mali est? Ovid.



And ye perish form the way] Or, in the way, that is in medio stadio, before
ye come to your Journies end, to the full accomplishment of your purposes and
practices, destruction shall suddenly seize you, 1 Thessalonians. 5.3.

When his wrath is kindled but a little] It is sometimes let out in minnums, as
Hos 5.12. but if timely course be not taken it grows to a great matter, as
Thunder does, and as Fire, that at first burns a little within upon a few
boards, but if not quenched, bursteth out in a most terrible flame.

Blessed are all they that put their trust in him] That is, in Christ, Joh.
14.1. Now to trust in him, is so to be unbottom'd of thy self, and of every
Creature, and so to lean upon Christ, that if he fail thee, thou sinkest: it is
to rely upon him alone for safety here, and Salvation hereafter. This, this is
to secure a man's title to true Blessedness; and with this grave sentence the
Prophet shuts up the whole Psalm, showing the different condition of the
godly from the wicked. See the Note on verse. 9.

PSALM. III.
A Psalm of David] Tremellius adds, Quem cecinit, which he sang when he
fled, etc. As Birds in the Spring, tune most sweetly, when it rains most sadly.
This was better yet, than that black Sanctis (as they call it) sung by our
Henry 2. in like case, and for like cause. For when, as some few hours before
he dyed, he saw a List of their names who conspired with the King of France,
D^n. Hist. 112
and Earl Richard, (his Son and Successor) against him, and found therein his
Son John (whom he had made Earl of Cornwell, Dorset, Summerset, Nottingham,
Darby, and Lancaster, etc.) to be the first: he fell into a grievous passion,
both cursing his Sons, and the day wherein himself was born; and in that
distemperature departed the world, which so often himself had distempered.

When he fled from] Heb. from the face of Absalom, which he had too much
admired, Midrash Tillin.
and was now afraid of. Then when he went up Mount Olivet weeping, 2 Samuel
15.30. made he this Psalm say the Rabbis. So in the Sack of Ziglag, he
comforted himself in the Lord his God, 1 Samuel 30.6. A Christian is never
without his Cordial.

Absalom his Son] his Darling, his Tidling, his one Eye. Such another good Son
was Barabbas, whcih signifies His Fathers Son, his white Boy, as we say, like
as Absalom signifies his Fathers peace, but it proved otherwise: as it
likewise befell Eve, when she called her firstborn Cain, and thought she had
got a great boon from the Lord. But Fallitur augurie spes bona saepe suo.

David was disappointed: for Absalom proved like the Sea Pacifick, or calm,
Heyl Geog
so it is called; but Captain Drake found it rough and troubleous above
measure. Absalom would have done by David, if he could have come at him, Turk
Hist
as afterward Amidas did with his Father Muleasses King of Tunes in Africa,
whom he first dethroned, and afterward put out his eyes. In Absalom was
nothing good but his name; that may have a good name, the nature whereof is so
ill, that it is not to be named: like as Levit. 20.17. abominable. Incest
between Brother and Sister is called Ch^sed, or Kindness, per Antiphrasin.

Verse. 1. Lord, how are they increased that trouble me?] He worthily wondreth
at so sudden a change: Omnia sunt hominum tenui pendentia filo:
Et subito casu, quaevaluere, ruunt.


David was deserted by all almost, and had now as many enemies as till now he
had subjects, excepting a few that stuck to him. Our Hen. 6. who had been the
most Potent Monarch for Dominions that ever England had, was, when deposed, not
the master of a Mole-hil: and served to show that mortality was but the stage
of mutability.

Many are they that rise up against me] Many, and many; by the Figure Anaphora:
here is also in the Original an (...) in the words, Tsarai in the former
clause, and Gnalai in the latter: not unlike that doleful ditty of the Church,
Lam. 5.16. Oi na lanu, chei chattanu, Woe to us that we have sinned: which is so
elegant in the Original, that Mr. Will. Whately of Banbury (who used to be
very plain in his preaching, Mr. Leig Saints encou. Ep. dedic.
and not to name a Greek, Latin, or Hebrew word) quoted it once in the Hebrew,
as an Hearer of his relates.

Verse. 2. Many there be which say of my soul] These scoffs and sarcasmes
Leniter volant, non leniter violant. David felt them as a murdering weapon in
his bones. Psalm. De patient. cap. 15.
42.3.10. and often complains of them to God, Qui satis idoneus est patientiae
sequester, as Tertullian phraseth it, who will see that his Saints shall lose
nothing by their patience.

There is no help for him in God] Salvation it self cannot save him: he is at
that pass, that there is neither hope of better for him, nor place of worse:
there is no help, health, or deliverance for him at all. The Hebrew has a
letter more than ordinary, to increase the signification. R. David renders it,
Nullum auxilium, nullum auxilium, there is no help, there is no help for him:
and interprets it, neither in this world, nor in the world to come. Thus
happily his enemies argued from his sin in the matter of Vriab; concluding that
God would not look at him therefore. But for that matter, he had soundly
repented, and made his peace, 2 Samuel Ex tradit. Hebraeor.
12.13. and Psalm. 51.1, 2. though this present cons piracy, and the trouble
thereupon (which lasted six Months, says Hierom) was a part of the temporal
punishment of that scandalous sin, 2 Samuel 12.10. But that it lay not upon his
Conscience, it appears, in that on his Deathbed he regrateth it not, as he
did his not punishing of Joab and Shimei; concerning whom he therefore leaves
his charge with his Son Solomon, 1 King. 2.5, 8.

Selah] i.e. Plane, Tremel. Omnino, pe^itus, revra, Polan. (...)
In truth, or Amen, says Aben-Ezra. The Hebrews at this day accordingly add
to the end of their Prayers and Epitaphs, Amen, Selah, twice or thrice
repeated. The Greek makes it only a Musical Notion.

Verse. 3. But thou O Lord art a Shield for me] And such a Shield as will never
fail me: Prodente clypeo vulneratus sum, I am betrayed by my Shield, said
Brasidus the Lacedaemonian, Plutarch.
when he was wounded through it. David had a better Shield than so: better then
that of Ajax, in Homer, which was (...); better than that of Demosthenes,
whereupon was written, Quod felix faustumque sit; better than that of Sceva at
the siege of Dyrrachium, wherewith he so long resisted Pompeys Army, Lucan.
that he had two hundred and twenty Darts sticking in it. -- Densamque tulit in
pectore sy^vam. God was to David a Shield round about him, as the Hebrew here
has it: and not a Shield only, but a Sun too, as Psalm. 84.11. Hence it
follows,

My Glory] Or, my Victory, Quia victor semper babet gloriam, faith Aben-Ezra
here, because a Conqueror is never without glory: such as was Caesar with his
Veni, vidi, vici; and Cimon the Athenian, who twice in one day triumphed over
the Persian Navy; and Hunniades, who fought five times in one day with the
Turks, and five times foiled them, and put them to flight. Whereupon he was
entertained, (...) Hist. 69.
and welcomed home with most glorious acclamations of the people, some calling
him the Father, some the Defender of his Country: the Soldiers their
invincible General, the Captives their Deliverer, the Women their Protector,
the Young Men and Children their most loving Father, etc.

And the lifter up of my head] Giving me matter of mirth; and making me who was
very sad, and thrown down with grief, joyful and cheerful. See Genesis 40.13, 20.
Luke 21.28. Jer. 52.31. Psalm. 110.7.

Verse. 4. I cried unto the Lord with my voyce] I prayed aloud, and lustily; I
roused up my self, and wrastled with God; and this was the ground of his
courage, and confidence. So Ester, when she had fasted and prayed, put her life
in her hands, and was fearless. So Christ, when being in an Agony, he had
prayed more earnestly, went and met his enemies in the face; though before his
Soul was heavy to the death, and he began to be out of the world, as the word
signifies, (...)
Matthew. 26.37.

And he heard me out of his holy hill] i. e. e suo sacrario and caelesti and
terrestri, Jun.
out of his heavenly and earthly Sanctuary. Zion signifies a Sure-hold, a
goodly Prospect; for that, from the top of that Hill a man might have seen all
the Country over. And it was a type of Heaven, whence God sees all, and
hears his. Lucian the Atheist feigneth, or fancieth, that there are certain
chinks in Heaven, through which Jupiter at certain times only hears his
Suitors: which times they who take not, pray to no purpose.

Verse. 5.1 I laid me down and slept] My faith was above my fear: I knew whom I
had trusted. No marvel I slept so soundly, seeing Antipater was by, and
watched, Plutarch.
said Philip of Macedon. We may better say so of Antipater our gracious Father.
O the safety of Saint! He ever goes guarded with the peace of God within him,
and the power of God without him, Phil. 4.7. 1 Pet. 1.5. and hence his
Spiritual security. David will never break his sleep for any danger, or doubt
of success. Peter was found fast asleep the night before he should have been
executed, Acts 12.6. So was our Proto-Martyr in Queen Mary's days, Mr. Rogers;
in so much as that, scarce with much shogging, could he be awaked, when he was
called for to be burned. Some few years since, Mr. White of Dorchester, being a
Member of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, was appointed Minister of
Lambeth; but for the present could get no convenient house to dwell in, but one
that was possessed by the Devil. This he took; and not long after, his Maid
sitting up late, Mirror for Saints, by Mr. Clark, 460.
the Devil appeared to her: whereupon in a great fright she ran up to tell her
Master; he bad her get to bed, saying, she was well served for sitting up so
late. Presently after the Devil appeared to Mr. White himself, standing at his
beds feet. To whom Master White said, If thou have nothing else to do thou
may stand there still, and I will betake my self to my rest: And accordingly
composing himself to sleep, the Devil vanished.

I awaked] A Proverbial speech, as Mar. 4.27. Turk. Hist. 218.
Tamerlan could not sleep at all through care (though he endeavored it) the
night before the mortal battle between him and Bajazet.

For the Lord sustained me] Heb. Will sustain me. He has done it, and I doubt
not, but he will do it again: Experience breeds confidence. He has, he will,
is an ordinary Scripture medium.

Verse. 6. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people. etc.] Quomodo
timeret hominem homo in sin Dei posit us? says an Ancient. See here in David
the triumph of trust in God. David looks not downward on the rushing and
roaring streams of troubles that ran so swiftly under him, for that would have
made him giddy; Glori^tio fidei eleganuffima. Jun.
but steadfastly fastneth on the power and promise of God All-sufficient, and is
confident. This, the world wondreth at; but little do they know the force of
faith, nor the privy armor of proof that the Saints have about their hearts.
Achilles was said to be safe, because Stygearmat us: A Christian is Deo
armatus, and therefore he walks about the world as a Conqueror.

Verse. 7. Arise, O Lord, etc.] If the Lord do but arise only, his enemies shall
be scattered; those also that hate him shall flee before him, Psalm. 68.1. And
God will arise and harness, when his people put his promises in suit by their
faithful prayers. This Moses knew, and therefore appointed the Priests,
whenever the Ark removed, to say, Rise up Lord. etc. Numb. 10.35. Commanders
must pray before they lead on their forces to battle, as did Hunniades, and
that late brave King of Sweden, more addicted to pray than to fight; according
to that, Vincere quisquis aves hostilem exercitum, age ante
Invictum, vincas per tua vota, D^uns.


Save me, O my God] David had many good old Soldiers about him, 2 Samuel 15.18
Lucan.
as the Cherethites, Pelethites, Gittites, and others that would stick to him
-- Animasque eapaces mortis, mighty men of War, and chafed in their minds, as
a Bear robbed of her Whelps in the field; himself also was a man of War from
his youth, 2 Samuel 17.8. and not used to be worsted; yet he flies to God for
deliverance, and pleads the Covenant ( Save me, O my God) which is that
Alviarium Divini mellis, the Beehive of heavenly honey. So Psalm. 119.94. I am
thine, save me.

For thou have smitten all mine enemies on the cheek-bone] Thou have given them
a box on the ear, Camb. Elizab. 494.
as Queen Elizabeth once did the Earl of Essex, turning his back upon her
uncivilly, upon some discontent: Or, as some great man does a mean fellow, with
whom he scorns to fight. Thou have sent them away with smart and shame enough.
Job 16.10. Thou have so handled them that now they may go seek their teeth in
their throats, as the Proverb is. Gods hand is a mighty hand, says Peter, 1
Epist. 5.6. it is a fearful thing to fall into it, says Paul Heb. 10.31. For
who knows the power of his wrath, says Moses, Psalm. 90.11? His enemies are
sure to speed worse than did Dares in Virgil, whom when he had been well beaten
by old Entellus, Ving. Aeneid. l. 5.
his fellows led away Jactantemque ^troque caput, crassumque cruorem
Ore rejectantem, mistosque insangume dentes.


Verse. 8. Salvation belongs unto the Lord] Here is much in few. Fulgentius
says, that the most golden sentence is ever measured by brevity, and suavity.
Brevis and suavis, planeque aurea est haec sententia. Salvation in the full
extent of it (and it is very comprehensive) is of the Lord. It properly
denotes the privative part of man's happiness, freedom from evils and enemies
of all sorts. But it imports the positive part also, fruition of all good:
and all is from the Lord, he alone is the chief efficient and Author of all,
Act. 4 in Ve^.
the true Sospitator, the (...) which says Tully, is a word so emphatical,
that other Tongues can hardly find another word fit to express it. See the
Note on Jon. 2.9.

Thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah] Or (prayer-wise) Let thy blessing be
upon thy people: Etiam qui imprudenter ad Absalomum desciverat, Jun.
even upon those also who have foolishly taken part with Absalom against me
(thus David prays for his Rebels, as Christ and Stephen afterward did for
their Persecutors and Murderers) but especially upon those that do yet adhere
unto me, and are shortly to fight for me. David knew that victory is of the
Lord, and must be got by prayer. For it Queen Elizabeth could say, Cui adhaereo
praeest, He whose part I take shall get the better, how much more may the Lord
of Hosts say so? This, the people also knew and therefore persuaded David not
to venture his person amongst them in the Field, but to stay at home and pray
for them, 2 Samuel 18.3. It is better, say they, that thou succor us out of the
City: thence shall thou help us, or cause us to be helped; that is, thy prayers
shall prevail with God for our assistance, as the Rabbis sense that text.

Solah] or, so be it, Hoc ratum, firmumq, esto. See verse. 2.

PSALM. IV.
TO the chief Musician] Or, (...) Chro. 25. 1, 2.
to the most excellent Musick-master, to the chief Chaunter Asaph, was this,
and some other Psalms, committed, that they might be sung in the best manner,
and with greatest care. So Alexander on his Deathbed left his Kingdom (...),
Optimatum optime, to him that should be the best of the best. (...) Hoc jamdiu
^onsecutus est Roscius, ut in (...) quisque ar^ficio excellent in suo ge^ere
Roscius (...). Cic. de Orat.
(...) was Tully's Motto, that is, strive to excel others, to crop off the very
top of all virtues. as Scipio is said to have done; to be best at any thing, to
be careful to excel in good works, Tit. 3.8. and to bear away the bell, as we
say, in whatsoever a man undertaketh.

On Neginoth] i.e. Instrumemta pulsatilia, stringed Instruments, such as are to
be touched, or played upon with the hand. Lord, says Nazianzen, I am an
Instrument for thee to touch. Let us lay our selves open to the Spirits touch;
and so make music.

Verse. 1. Here me when I call, O God of my righteousness] that is, O thou
righteous Judge of my righteous Cause, and of my good Conscience. David
speaks first to God, and then to men: This is the right method. We therefore
speak no better to men, because no more to God. It is said of Charles the Fifth,
that he spent more words with God than with men. When we are vilified, and
derigrated by others, as David here was, let us make God acquainted with our
condition, by his example. But why does David beg audience, and mercy, in
general only, and not lay open to God his particular grievances? Surely because
he looked upon the favor of God as a complexive blessing, that perfectly
comprehends all the rest; as Manna is said to have had all good tastes in it.
For particulars, David was content to be at Gods dispose. I humbly beseech
thee, that I may find grace in thy sight, my Lord, O King, said that false
Ziba to David, 2 Samuel 16.4. q. d. I had rather have the Kings favor than
Mephibosheths Lands. David really had rather have Gods love and favor than all
this worlds good: and therefore so heartily beggeth it above any thing.

Thou have enlarged me when I was in distress] Heb. Thou have made roomth for
me. Hoc autem in Prophetia dictum est, says R. David this was Prophetically
spoken. Thou have, that is, thou will enlarge me who am now in distress. God
will surely be nearest unto his in their greatest straights: and because they
have made him the God of their Mountains, he will be the God of their valleys
also.

Verse. 2. O ye sons of men] Ye Grandees. Psalm. 49.3. who think to carry all
before you with those big looks, and bubbles of words; ye who are potent at
Court, and therefore insolent above measure. David having poured out his heart
to God in prayer, takes heart of grace thus freely to bespeak these great ones
his enemies.

How long will ye turn my glory into shame?] i. e. attempt to put me beside
the Kingdom, whereunto God has designed and destined me? You think, belike, to
jeer me out of my right, and by casting upon me Cart-loads of Calumnies, and
contumelies, to make me desist, and hang up my hopes. But it is otherwise,
believe it, Psalm. 14.6, 7. ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the
Lord is his refuge. But will he therefore give over praying? No, for in the
next words he falls on, and says, O that the Salvation of Israel were come out
of Zion, etc.

How long will ye love vanity? etc.] i. e. trouble your selves to no purpose,
whiles ye plot, and plow mischief to him who is blessed, and shall be blessed
ingratiis vestris? you love, you seek: that is, you both inwardly affect
wickedness, and outwardly act it; but all in vain,

Verse. 3. But know that the Lord has set apart him that is godly] Quod
separatum asseruerit, that God has destined mine head to the Diadem of the
Kingdom, and therefore it shall not be in your power to hinder me: Since
voluntas Dei, necessitas Rei, and this I would have you to know, and rest
assured of. Let us be no less confident of the Crown of Glory, Luke 12.32. Fear
not little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you a kingdom.
And 2 Timothy 2.19. The foundation of God abides sure, having this double seal,
i. e. The Lord (for his part) knows who are his; and we, for our parts may
know, that if we but name the name of the Lord in prayer, and depart from evil,
we shall certainly be saved.

The Lord will hear when I call unto him] Being that I am a godly man, a
gracious Saint, one that have obtained mercy, and am thereby made merciful to
others, (for so much the word signifies) I doubt not of audience and
acceptance in Heaven. God regards not the prayer, if the person be not right.
For Witches some plead, that they use good prayers: in answer whereunto one
says well, Si magicae, Deus non vult tales: si piae, non per tales. God
hears not good prayers from a bad man; as that State in story would not hear
a good motion from an ill mouth: or, as we cannot endure to hear sweet words
from a stinking breath. The blood of a Swine might not be offered in
Sacrifices, though better to look upon than the blood of a Sheep.

Verse. 4. Stand in awe and sin not] Be stirred, or commoved, or troubled.
Tremble and sin not. But now adays the Word and the World too is altered; for
men sin and tremble not; being arrived at that dead and dedolent disposition of
those Heathens who were past feeling, Ephesians. 4.18, 19. St. Paul rather alludeth
to this text, Ephesians. 4.6. than cites it as some think.

Commune with your own heart upon your bed] Advise with your Pillow what you
have to do in a business so important, as the practice of Repentance, whereunto
I am now exhorting you. Here then examine your selves, prove your own selves,
as 2 Cor. 13.5. Sift you, sift you, Zeph. 2.1. Recoil, turn short again upon
your selves, thrust your hands into your bosoms, as Moses did, and took it out
again Leprous, white as snow. Take a review of your hearts and lives, converse
with your selves; a wise man can never want with whom to discourse, though he
be alone. But as it is a sign that there are great distempers in that Family
where Husband and Wife go diverse days together, and speak not the one to the
other: so in that Soul that flies from it self, and can go long without
Self-examination. A good man's business lies most within doors, and he takes
the fittest time (night or day) for the better dispatch of it, though thereby
he abridge himself of his Natural rest. Mr. Bradford, the young Lord
Harrington, and sundry others, kept Journals, or Day-books, and often read them
over, for an help to Humiliation.

And be still. Selah] Or, make a pause, dwell upon the work of self-examination
till you have made somewhat of it, till you have driven it up to a Reformation;
as Lam. 3.39, 40. Let us try, and turn. The word signifies Be dumb; and
hereupon all our Silentiaries have founded their superstitious opinions and
practices; such as were those old Monks of Egypt, who says Cassian, were
umbrarum more silentes and (...) as speechless as Ghosts. So the Carthusian
Monks at this day, who speak together but once a week. Some kind of Anabaptists
also will not speak a word to any, but those of their own Sect.

Verse. 5. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness] Confess your sins, and slay
them; run to him who is the propitiation, Jesus Christ the righteous, present
your bodies a living Sacrifice, bring a contrite spirit; to do good, and to
communicate forget not, etc. else you offer the sacrifice of fools, as Eccles.
5.1. and not of righteousness, here. The Chaldee has it, Domate concupiscenti
as, sacrifice and subdue your lusts.

And put your trust in the Lord] It is well observed, that God brings men home
by a contrary way, to that they fell from him. We fell from him by distrust, by
having him in a jealousy, as if he aimed more at himself than at our good. We
return to him by having a good conceit of him, that he loves us better than we
can love our selves, and therefore that we ought to put our trust in him, both
in life and death.

Verse. 6. There be many that say, Who will show us, etc.] This is Vox populi,
the common cry: Studium improborum vagum, good they would have, but pitch not
upon the true good. It was well observed, that he who first called Riches Bona,
goods, was a better Husband than Divine; but the most are such Husbands. O
siquis daret ut vide^mus bonum! Who will help us to a good bargain, a good
estate? etc. but God the chief good is not in all their thoughts; they mind
not communion with him, or conformity to him, which is the Bonum hominis, Mic.
6.8. the totum hominis, Eccles. 12.13. the one thing necessary, though nothing
is less thought upon. What are these outward comforts, so much affected, and
admired, says Plato, but Dei ludibria, banded up and down like Tennis Balls,
from one to another? A Spiritual man heeds not wealth, or at least makes it not
his business. What tell you me of Money, says Paul? I need it not, but to
further your reckoning, Phil. 4.1. And David having spoken of those rich and
wretched people that have their portion herein all abundance, Psalm. 17.14.
concludes, I neither envy their store, nor covet their happiness: it is
enough for me, that when I awake, so. at the Resurrection of the just, I shall
be full of thine Image, verse. ult. Christ, who had all riches, scorned these
Bona scabelli, earthly riches; he was born poor, lived poor, dyed poor; for, as
Austin observes, when Christ dyed he made no will etc. and as he was born in
another man's house, so he was buried in another man's tomb; And yet he was, and
still is, God blessed for ever. Cicero indeed writing to Atticus, would have
one friend wish to another three things only, viz. to enjoy Health, possess
Honor, and not suffer Necessity. How much better Paul's with, Grace, Mercy, and
Peace? or David's desire here?

Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us] One good cast of Gods
countenance was more to David than all this Worlds wealth than a confluence of
all outward comforts and contentments. He had set up God for his chief good,
and the light of Gods loving Countenance was the guide of that way that leads
to that good; and hence his importunity; he cannot draw breath but in that air,
nor take comfort in any thing without Gods gracious aspect, and some comings in
from Christ. It is better, says one, to feel Gods favor one Hour in our
repenting Souls, than to sit whole Ages under the warmest Sunshine that this
world affords. Says not David so much in the next words?

Verse. 7. Thou have put gladness into my heart, more than, etc.] Joys
unspeakable, and full or glory, 1 Pet, 1.8. We read of some godly men that they
have been overwhelmed with Spiritual joy, till they have cried out, Hold Lord,
stay thine hand. I can bear no more: like weak eyes, that cannot endure to bear
the light. Indeed, Bain. Letter^
this is not every good man's case, witness that saying of sweet Master Bain, I
thank God in Christ, sustentation I have, but suavities spiritual I taste not
any. And that of holy Rolloc, Whiles I live I never look to see perfect
Reformation in the Church, or to feel perfect ravishing joys in mine heart. But
those Gods people have, are far beyond all Carnal comforts.

Than in the time that their Corn, etc.] These indeed are the precious fruits
of the earth, Jam. 5.7. but they seal not up special favor. A man may have
together with them animam triticeam, as that rich fool had. Animas etiam
incarnavimus, as a Father complains. These outward things are got within men,
and have stolen away their warmest and liveliest affections from God: Not so in
the Saints; They must have God, or else they dye. The people mourned, and put
on black, when they heard that God would not go with them himself, but send an
Angel with them, Exodus 33.2, 3. And when great gifts were sent to Luther, he
sent them back again with this brave speech, I will not be put off with these
poor things: I look for better. Let God bestow himself upon me, and it
suffices. As with Manna there fell a dew, so to a good Soul, together with
Corn and Wine (be it more or less) there is a secret influence of God, which
the carnal heart is not acquainted with. A fly cannot make that of a Flower,
that a Be can do. The treacherous Shechemites had plenty of Corn and Wine,
Judge. 9.27. but having not the grace of God withal, they were soon after
destroyed by Abimelech.

Verse. 8. I will both lay me down in peace and sleep] Heb. In peace together
will I lie down and sleep; that is, says the Syriack interpreter, Non solum
cubabo sed etiam Dormiam, I will not only lie down, but also sleep; which many
cannot do for fears and cares, those Gnats that keep them waking. The Arabic
has it, I sleep as securely in adversity as those can that are in prosperity.
Others thus, I will lay me down together with the joy before spoken of, and
confidence in God: this shall be my Bedfellow; and then I am sure to rest
sweetly and safely. For, Thou Lord only make, thou set me in safety, thou
give to thy beloved sleep, Psalm. 127.2. that is, extraordinary quiet
refreshing sleep, as the learned note upon the Aleph quiescent in (...) which
is not usual.

PSALM. V.
TO the chief Musician] See on Psalm. 4. title.

Upon Nehiloth] Upon Wind-instruments. Pneumatica, tribulata. The Rabbis say
that this Psalm was made and appointed to be sung concerning Doeg and Ahitophel.

Verse. 1. Give ear to my words, O Lord] David knew him to be a Prayer-hearing
God, Psalm. 65.2. and that his ears were always open (as the doors of the Roman
Aediles were) to hear complaints and requests; hence this prayer.

Consider my meditation] i. e. the conception of my soul uttered with a low
voice, ( Murmur meuns. Hieron.) but with most vehement affection. All this,
Mussitatione^^ meam.
the Hebrew word imports.

Verse. 2. Hearken unto the voice of my cry] He thrice repeats the same request,
to show the greatness of his grief and the necessity of help from Heaven. Let
mind and mouth, spirit and speech, go together in prayer, and then its right,
the voice of the Heart is simply necessary: Moses cried to God at the red Sea,
though he said nothing. The voice of the lips is of great use also. 1. For
preventing of distraction. 2. For exciting devotion.

My King] And therefore help O King, as she said, 2 King. 5.24. And my God] who
art in covenant with me, both offensive and defensive.

For unto thee will I pray] Thou art the proper object of Prayer, as being
Omnipresent, Omniscient, Omnipotent: and a God in covenant with thy people.

Verse. 3. (...)
My voice shall thou hear in the morning] That fittest season, usually, for
Prayer, or any other serious business: The very Heathens chose the morning
chiefly for Sacrifice, as Nestor in Homer, the Argonauts in Apollonius. The
Persian Magi sang Hymns to their Gods at break of day, and worshipped the
rising Sun. The Pinarii and Potitii (certain Idolatrous Priests) sacrificed
every morning and Evening to Hercules upon the great Altar at Rome. The Jews
counted and called it an Abomination of desolation, if at any time the Morning
and Evening Sacrifice to the Lord were intermitted: So should Christians, if
they offer not unto him twice a day at least, viz. Morning and Evening prayers
and praises. Mass and Meat hinder no man's thrift, say the very Papists. A whet
is no let, a bait by the way hinders not the journey: so neither does prayer
in a morning hinder a man's business, be it never so hasty or weighty, but
furthereth it rather. Cardinal Wolsie, though he were Lord Chancellor, His
Life and Death by his Gentle. Ush. page 18.
when he came in a morning out of his privy Chamber, would not go abroad till
he had heard two Masses, nor go to bed at night with any part of his service
unsaid, no not so much as one Collect. Mahometans, what occasion soever they
have by profit or pleasure, pray constantly five times a day. Christians have a
charge to continue instant in prayer, and to let all business wait upon it,
(...)
Romans 12.12. with Act. 6.4. David knew that if prayer stand still, the trade of
godliness stands still. He therefore will be up and at it betimes, and rather
break his sleep than leave such a duty undone.

In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up] Or, look
out, spy like a Watchman. Gnarach. Or dinavit, aciem disposuit. Tsaphah.
Speculando expectavit.
Two Military words the Prophet here makes use of; he would not only pray,
but marshal up his prayers, put them in array. And when he had done, he would
be as a Spy upon a Tower, to see whether he prevailed, whether he got the day.
Some men pray of course, or as a task, but never look after their prayers, or
mark what answer: This is very great folly and oscitancy. Who sends forth a
Ship, and waits not for the return thereof? Who shoots an Arrow, or casts a
Boul, and looks not where it lights? Prayer is the Souls Arrow, Angle, Seed,
Dove, Messenger, etc. And they that take not notice how they speed, deal as
scofling Pilat did, who scornfully asked Christ, What Is truth? but stayed not
for the answer. If God shall hearken what David speaks, David must likewise
hearken what God will speak. He must look up to God, if God shall look out of
himself to David; since he humbles himself to behold things done in Heaven,
Psalm 113.6. by a wonderful condescension; how much more then to look upon man
that is a Worm, and the Son of man that is a Worm, Job 25.6. Tantus, tantillum?

Verse. 4. For thou art not a God that has pleasure in wickedness] As the Kings
of the Earth have, says R. Solomon. Alexander the Great promising a Crown of
one hundred and eighty pound to those of his Guests that drank most, caused one
and forty to kill themselves with drinking for that Crown. King Charles the
Ninth of France, gave one Albertus Tudius, an Hucksters Son, six hundred
thousand Crowns, Camera. Med. H^stor.
to teach him to swear with a grace. But God perfectly hates wickedness, and
wicked persons. There were more remarkable expressions of Gods anger upon man's
sin, in the dead body of a Man, than of a Beast, Numb. 11.31. The one made
unclean but till the evening, the other, seven days. God hates sin worse than
he does the Devil, for he hates the Devil for sins sake, and not sin for the
Devils lake. He hates sin naturally in whomsoever, like as we hate Poison,
whether it be in a Toad, or in a Princes Cabinet. We read of Antipathies in
Nature betwixt the Elephant and the Boar, the Lion and the Cock, the Horse and
the Stone Taraxippe, etc. but nothing so great, as betwixt God the chiefest
good, and sin the utmost evil. Let us be like affected to our heavenly Father,
as dear Children, abhorring that which is evil, Romans 12.9. hating it as we do
Hell it self, so the Greek word there signifies, abandoning it, and abstaining
from all appearance of it, as it is Offensivum Dei, and aversivum a Deo, an
offense against God, (...) a breach of his Law.

Neither shall evil dwell with thee] Heb. sojourn with thee, 2 Samuel 12.
or be harboared as a Guest, much less as an home-dweller. Peter Martyr out of
Nathans Parable observes, that Lust was but a stranger to David, that lodged
with him for a night only. Though corruption may intrude upon us, and enter,
yet it may not be harbored, and dwell with us; lest the Trave^our become the
man of the house.

Verse. 5. The foolish shall not stand in thy sight] Heb. before thine eyes, as
thy Favorites and Attendance. Those furious, vainglorious Mad-caps, as they
call them, Roysters, Royoters, Roaring-boys, as they delight to call themselves
by a woeful Prolepsis of the present for the future. The word is used for mad,
or raving with folly, Eccles. 2.2.12. and 7.9. and 10.13. Isa. 44.25. Psalm.
75.5. and 73.3. God has no need of such Madmen as Achish King of Gath said,
when they brought David before him, and he feigned himself distracted. We
likewise must have no fellowship with such, Ephesians. 5.11. but reprove them rather.

Thou hate all workers of iniquity] Though they not only act it, but art it,
polish and trim their sin, that it may seem less heinous, as Hypocrites do, who
hide their wickedness with no less subtle slights, than Rachel hid the Idols,
Rahab the Spies. But God will detect and detest them. See the Note on verse. 4.

Verse. 6. Thou shall destroy them that speak leasing] Whether in jest or
earnest, those that lie in jest, will without repentance go to Hell in earnest.
And for the officious lie, some think it no fault: whereas Gal. 1.10. we must
not speak truth to please men, much less may we lie. the truth is, all lies are
pernicious, and all Liers will be destroyed, but especially those that have
^aught their tongues to speak lies, Jer. 9.5. that take fast hold of deceit,
Jer. 8:5. so that they cannot be got off without striving: such an one was
Doeg, Saul, etc.

The Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man] Heb. the man of blood: for
blood has so many tongues as drops to cry for vengeance, Genesis 4. and God makes
inquisition, Psalm. 9.12. commanding that Murderers should be drawn from the
Altar to the Slaughter, Exodus 21.14. This made King James say, that if God did
leave him to kill a man, he would think God did not love him. As for deceitful
persons. the Lord is the avenger of all such, 1 Thessalonians. 4.6.

Verse. 7. But as for me] Who am conscious of none of these foul and flagicious
practices. The upright shall dwell in Gods presence, Job 12.16. Psalm. 140.13.
not so the hypocrite and ungodly. He is like a Vagabond begging at the Gate,
and not knowing whether the Master of the house is providing for him an Alms,
or a Cudgel.

I will come into thine house, etc.] He knew that the Ark and Mercy-seat were
never separated.

And in thy fear will I worship, etc.] The fear of God is, 1 Servile; this
David means not. 2 Filial or amicable. And this again is, either Timor
culpae, fear to offend so good a God, and to forget his favor, Prove. 8.13. Or,
Timor cultus, the fear that is to be expressed in our addresses to Almighty
God, that reverential godly fear, Jer. 5.22. Heb. 12.28. Psalm. 2.11. and here.
Thus the very Angels make their addresses to the most high God, with greatest
self-abacements, Isa. 6. Bern. de diverse. 25.
How much more should we silly and sinful Creatures? Omnino oportet nos
orationis tempore curiam intrare coelestem (says Bernard) in qua Rex regum
stellato sedit solio, circundante innumerabili and ineffabili beatorum
spirituum exercitu. Quanta ergo cum reverentia, quanto timore, quanta illuc
humilitate ascedere, debet e palude sua procedens and repens vilis renuncula?
that is, at prayer time we should enter into the heavenly Palace, where the
King of Kings fitteth in a stately Throne, environed with an innumerable
company of Angels and Saints. With how great reverence therefore, godly fear
and humility should a poor paltry Frog come, who is newly crawled out of his
guzzle?

Verse. 8. Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness] that is, in thy faithfulness,
and according to thy promise in that behalf made unto me, to be my God and
guide even unto death, to lead me in the way everlasting, to direct my
footsteps in thy fear, etc. Deduc me ut non titubem, says R. David, Lead me,
that I stumble not; or if I do, yet that I fall not: for he that stumbleth and
falls not, gets ground.

Because of mine enemies] Or, because of mine observers, who narrowly watch for
my halting, that they might blaspheme thee, and thy religion, through my
default, 1 Samuel 18.9. Saul fixed his eyes upon David, but for no good to him.
So 1 Pet. 2.12. and 3.2. (...)
wicked men spy, and pry accurately (as the word signifies) into the courses
of Gods people, to see what evil they can find out and fasten on. We should
therefore walk exactly, Ephesians. 5.15. and pray earnestly, as here.

Make thy way straight before my face] Remove all rubs and Remoraes, and lay
all plain and level, that I may walk and not be weary, run and not faint, Isa.
40. ult.

Verse. 9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth] Or, stedfastness,
nothing that a man may bind or build upon, so slippery they are and untrusty.

Their inward part is very wickedness] Heb. Woeful evils, heavy annoyances;
their hearts are the Devils Storehouses.

Their throat is an open Sepulcher] And so, more dangerous than if it were
shut, says Aben-Ezra here. In these open Sepulchers sending out much noisome
stench, they frequently bury the good names of their betters. But the comfort
is, that there shall one day be a Resurrection as well of names as of bodies.
This the Apostle accommodateth, ( Romans 3.13.) to the universal corruption of
Mankind; and well he might, for as much as by Nature there is never a better of
us: but as there were many Marii in one Caesar, so are there many Doegs and
Absoloms in the best of us all. As in water face answers to face, so does the
heart of a man to a man.

They flatter with their tongue] The Apostle, Romans 3.13. renders it: With
their tongues they have used deceit. And it is remarkable, that in the Anatomy
of a Natural man there he stands more on the Organs of Speech, Tongue, Lips,
Mouth Throat, than on all the rest of the Members.

Verse. 10. Destroy thou them, O God] Heb. Condemn them as guilty. They were
Gods enemies no less than David's, Tom. 8. in Enarr. ^ujus precationis.
and implacable, incorrigible: and hence he so prays against them Est
Prophetia, non malediction, says Austin.

Let them fall by their own counsel;] As it befell Ahitophel, Haman, the
Powder-Traitors. Or, let them fall from their own counsels, i.e. not be able to
effect their evil designs, but defeated, frustrated.

Cast them out, etc.] Let those who were once a terror, now be a scorn. for
they are even ripe for ruin, as having added rebellion to their sin, Job.
34.37.

For they have rebelled against thee] And so are more thine enemies than mine:
which makes me so earnest against them, being swallowed up with a zeal of thy
glory.

Verse. 11. But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoyce] Joy is the
just man's portion, and contra, Hos. 9.1. Isa. 65.13, 14. and according to the
measure of his faith, so is his joy, 1 Pet. 1.8.

Let them ever shout] or, shrill out, set up their Note as a Peacock does,
which has his name in Hebrew from this root.

Because thou defendest them] Heb. Velut pie tabernaculum. R. David.
Thou over-coverest them with thy sure defense, for upon all the glory shall be
a defense. And there shall be a Tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from
the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm, and from
rain, Isa. 4.5, 6. The Ram-skins covering the Ark from the violence of wind and
weather, figured out Christ's protecting his people.

Let them also that love thy name] As all the Virgins do who have smelt Christ's
name as an Ointment poured out, Cant. 1.3. See the Note there.

Be joyful in thee] Heb. exult, and leap for joy, as if they were dancing
Levalto's. Thus Dr. Tailor the Martyr, fetched a frisk, and danced when he was
near unto the place where he should be burnt. Rabbi Zabdi Ben Levi repeated
this verse when he was at point of death. Mid. Tillin, in Psalm. 5
Another, that in Psalm. 32. For this shall every one that is godly pray unto
thee. A Third, that in Psalm. 84. One day in thy Courts is better, etc. A
Fourth, that in Psalm. 31. O how great is thy goodness, etc.

Verse. 12. For thou Lord wilt bless the righteous] yea the righteous man shall
abound with blessings, Prove. 28. 20. yea God will bless all them that bless
him, Genesis 12.3. or that but give him a cup of cold water, Mat. 10.

With favour] Or, goodwill; Qua praecedit nostram bonam voluntatem, says
Augustine.

Will thou compass him] Or, encircle him as with a Crown, and so make them
higher than the Kings of the earth, Psalm. 89.27. whose Crowns cannot keep their
heads from aching, but fill them with cares; which made one King cry out, Val.
Max
O vilis pannus, etc. and another spoke this to his Crown, Nobilis es fateor,
rutilisque onerata lapillis,
Innumeris curis sed comitata venis.
Quod been si nossent omnes expendere, neme
Nemo foret qui te tollere wellet humo.


As with a shield] A piked-shield, such as does circuire tres parts hominis,
compass about three parts of a man, says R. Solomon on this Text. Shields and
Bucklers' besides other Bosses for ornament, had one great Boss in the middle
with a sharp pike in it for use, to pierce and wound the adversary. See Job
15.26. God will be all in all to his People; Crown, Shield, etc. they may
therefore well enough rejoice, shout, leap, as in the former verse.

PSALM. VI.
TO the chief Musician on Neginoth] See Psalm. 4. Title.

Upon Sheminith] or upon the eight, i.e. Intentissimo sono and clarissimo voce,
Vatab.
to be sung aloud. An Eight is the highest Note in Music. See 1 Chronicles. 15.21.
Others say, that hereby is meant the Base and Tenor, as fittest for a Mourner.

Verse. 1. O Lord rebuke me not in thine anger] In this and some other Psalms,
David begins so heavenly, ends so merrily, that one might think they had been
composed by two men of a contrary humor, as Moulin observes. De L' amont
Divin.
Every new man is two men, Romans 7. The Shulamite has in her as it were the
company of two Armies, Cant. 6.13. The Lord also chequereth his Providence
white and black, he speckleth his work; (represented by those speckled Horses,
Zach. 1.8.) Mercies and Crosses are inter-woven.

Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure] Chastened, David desires to be, as
Jer. 10.24. 1 Cor. 11.32. Heb. 12.7, 8. But in Mercy, and in measure, 1 Cor.
10.13 Fury is not in me, says God, however it may sometimes seem to be, Isa.
27.4. Of furious people the Philosopher gives this Character, that they are
angry, (...) against those whom they should not. 2 (...) for matters they
should not. 3 (...) more than they should be. But none of all these can be
affirmed of God. Anger is not in him secundum affectum, but seems so to be
secundum effectum, when he chideth and smites (as angry people use to do) when
there is no other remedy, 2 Chronicles. 36.16. his anger is in Scripture put, 1 For
his threatenings, Hos. 11.9. Jon. 3.10. 2. For his punishments, Mat. 3.7. Romans
2.8. But as God therefore threatens that he may not punish, Amo. 4.12. so in
the midst of Judgment he remembers Mercy, and it soon repents him
concerning his people.

Verse. 2. Have mercy upon me, O Lord] As the woman in story appealed from
Philip to Philip; so does David fly from Gods anger to Gods grace; for he had
none else in Heaven or Earth to repair to, Psalm. 73.25. he seeks here to
escape him, by closing with God, and to get off, by getting within him.

For I am weak] or crushed, gnashed, extremely dejected with sickness of body
and trouble of mind. Basil expounds it of his soul sins into which he fell of
infirmity, and for which he was threatened with Judgments by the Prophet
Nathan.

O Lord heal me] On both sides heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee,
Psalm. 41.4. heal my body which is full of dolours and diseases, Psalm.
107.18.20. for thou art Jehovah the Phisician, Exodus 15.26. Heal mine estate,
which is very calamitous by reason of mine enemies, who wish my death, and
would gladly revel in my ruins. See Hos. 6.2. Isa. 30.26.

For my bones are vexed] viz. by reason of my leanness, and long lying. For
albeit the bones of themselves are insensible, and ache not. yet the membranes
and tunicles do, that compass the bones.

Verse. 3. My soul is also sore vexed] This was worse than all the rest. A light
load to a raw shoulder is very grievous. A little water in a leaden vessel is
heavy, so is a little outward grief to a laden soul. Hence Job so complains,
and Jeremy prays; be not thou a terror unto me, O Lord; and then I much
matter not what becomes of me.

But thou, O Lord, how long?] soil. Will thou stand off, and not have to my
help? This is plena affectus Reticentia, Vatab.
an emphatical and affectionate Aposiopesis, such as is ordinary with those
that are in pain, and durance.

Verse. 4. Return, O Lord, deliver my soul] He calls hard upon Jehovah, which
sweet name of God he has now five times in these four first Verses made use
of, as one that knew, and could improve the full import of it. Here David beggs
of him to return, not by change of place, for God fills all places (being
Enter, praesenter Deus hic and ubique potenter.)

But Miserationis serenitate by a beam of his mercy, and by a dispensation of
his gracious providence, altering his condition for the better, Deuteronomy. 30.9.
Act. 15.16.

O save me for thy mercies sake] Quam pulcherrime ista supplicatio propriis and
proficicuis sermonibus explicatur, says Cassiodore concerning this text, i.e.
How finely and fitly is this request set forth? David pleads not Merit, but
humbly craveth Mercy. The Heart (that piece of proud flesh) must be brought to
such a temper and tameness, as to crouch to God, for the crumbs that fall from
his table.

Verse. 5. For in death there is no remembrance of thee] Some Heathens were of
opinion that when a man dyed all dyed with him; neither was there any further
sense of weal or woe for ever. (...) Ethic. 1.3. c. 9
Socrates doubted, but Aristotle affirmed it to be so, for ought he knew.
Eusebius and Augustine make mention of certain Arabian Heretics, who held that
the Soul dyed with the Body, and so remained dead till the last day, and then
they revived with the resurrection of the body. This was long since exploded
for a foul error, contrary to that which the Scripture holds forth in many
places. All that David would say here is, that dead men remember not, that is,
they mention not Gods worthy Acts; to the quickening of others; their praises
cannot provoke other men to believe in God, or serve him, as in their lifetime
they might, therefore David would fain live to do more good. A certain Martyr
going to suffer said, he was sorry that he was going to a place where he
should do God no more work, Seven Epist. 3.
but be receiving wages only. Domine si adhuc populo tuo sim necessarius non
recuso laborem, said a dying Saint, Lord, if I may be yet useful to thy people,
I should be very well content it might be so. See Isa. 38.18.19. David and
Hezekiah prayed hard that they might not yet dye, lest Religion, and the true
Worship of God, which they had begun to vindicate and establish, should by
their decease fall to the ground, through the wickedness of their survivers and
successors.

In the grave who shall give thee thanks?] scil. Palani and cum aliis, says
Aben-Ezra, openly and exemplarily, in the company of others. Some render it, In
Hell who shall consess to thee? Hereby is showed the fear of Gods Children
(says Diodate) anguished by the feeling of his Wrath, least they should dye
out of his grace unreconciled, and by that means be excluded and debarred from
their desired aim, to be everlastingly instruments of his glory. But it is
better to take Sheol here for the place and state of the dead, after their
dissolution; though Dilrio will needs have it to be always in Scripture meant
of Hell: which if it be so, then why should Job so earnestly desire to be hid
in it, chap. 14.13. That was a singular example of Paul the Hermit, Adag.
Sacr. in 2 Samuel 22. Digress. 2. Hier. in Vit. Paul.
who though dead, seemed to be serving God, and affected those that beheld him.
For he was found (says Hierom) dead kneeling upon his knees, holding up his
hands, lifting up his eyes; so that the very dead corpse seemed yet, by a kind
of religious gesture, to pray unto God.

Verse. 6. I am weary with my groaning] I have labored therein, even unto
lassitude. There must be some proportion between our sin and our sorrow. A
storm of sighs at least, if not a shower of tears; some sorrow is above tears,
some constitutions are dry, and will not yield tears, and in such case dry
sorrow may be as available as wet. She that touched the heth of Christ's
Garment only was as welcome to him as Thomas, who put his fingers into the
print of the nails.

All the night make I my bed to swim] So one hours sin brought many nights
pain. Transit voluptas, mani^ dolo. Nocet emp^ dolor voluptas. Bishop Pilkiton
on Nehem. 1.4.
Did we but fore-think what sin will cost us, we durst not but be innocent. But
now adays (says a reverend Writer) weep a man may not, for disfiguring his
face; fasting is thought Hypocrisy and shame; and when his panch is full, then
as Priests with their drunken Now is said Mattens, and belched out, Eruct avit
cor meum verbum, with good devotion as they thought; so he blusters out a few
blustering words, and thinks it repentance sufficient, etc. Another descants
thus upon the text. As in Sicilia there is Fons Solis, the Fountain of the Sun,
out of which at Midday, when the Sun is nearest, flows cold water; at
Midnight, D. Playfere Psalm. 6.6.
when the Sun is further off, flows hot water: So the Patriarch David's head
is full of water, and his eyes a fountain of tears, who, when he enjoyed his
health as the warm Sunshine, was cold in confessing his sins. But being now
visited with sickness, his reins chastising him in the night season, he is so
sore troubled, and withal so hot, and so fervent, that every night he washes
his bed, Simson in Lo^
and waters, nay even melts his Couch with tears. etc. A third makes this
good Note upon these words; The place of David's sin (his Bed) is the place of
his repentance, and so it should be; yea when we behold the place where we
have offended, we should be pricked in heart, and there again crave him pardon:
As Adam sinned in the Garden, and Christ sweat bloody tears in the Garden;
sanctify by tears every place which we have polluted by sin, and let us seek
Christ Jesus in our Bed, with the Spouse in the Canticles, who says, In my bed
by night I sought him whom my soul loved, Cant. 3.1.

I Water my Couch with my tears] By Couch some understand that whereon David
lay in the day time for ease and refreshing, the same perhaps which David arose
off when he beheld Bathsheba washing her self; where began his misery, 2 Samuel
11.2. Others take it for his Pallet, his under-bed, which he also watered by
the abundance of his penitent tears. Ainsworth renders it, I water, or melt my
bed-stead. These are all excessive figurative speeches, to set forth the
greatness of his grief, and the multitude of his tears. Weeping becomes not a
King, says Euripides. But King David was of another mind, and so was he who
said -- Faciles motus mons generoscapit. Ovid.


Tears instead of Gems were the ornaments of David's bed, says Chrysostom.

Verse. 7. Mine eye is consumed] Heb. gnawn, moth eat^n. That eye of his that
had looked, and lusted after his Neighbors Wife, is now dimmed, and darkened
with grief and indignation, he had wept himself almost blind; Prideaux his
Introduct. to Hist. p. 289.
as it is storied of Faustus the Son of King Vortiger by his own Daughter, that
he wept himself stark blind for the abominable incest of his Parents.

It waxes old] or, is sunk in my head. Does not do its office, but is become
like an old dusty window that lets in little light. An heavy affliction to
those whose eyes have been loop-holes of Lust, and windows of wickedness, the
remembrance whereof is a thorn to their blind eyes, and puts them to grievous
pain, especially when their enemies shall have got it by the end, as David's had
his ill pranks, and spared not to lay it in his dish.

Verse. 8. Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity] What a strange change is
here all on the sudden? well might Luther say, Oration est birudo animae; Prayer
is the Leech of the Soul, that sucks out the venom and swelling thereof.
Prayer, says another, is an Exorist with God, and an Exorcist against sin and
misery. The Prophet I saiah calls it a Charm, chap. 26.16 because it lays our
Soul-distempers, and like David's Harp, drives away the evil spirit that is upon
us. Pray therefore when out of order, though not so fit to pray, fall upon the
duty by David's example here, and that will further fit thee for the duty. Thy
leaden lumpish heart cast into this holy fire, will heat and melt. Quoties me
oration, quem poee disperantem susceperat, reddidit expultantem and pr^sumentem
de venia, says Bernard? How often has prayer found me despairing almost, but
left me triumphing and well assured of pardon? The same in effect says David
here, Depart from me, etc. What a word is that to his insulting enemies, Avoid,
come out, vanish. These be words used to Devils, and dogs, but good enough
for a Doeg, or a Shimei. And the Son of David shall say the same to his
enemies, when he comes to Judgment.

For the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping] Tears then have a voice (as
well as Blood has) and God has an Ear for them. And as Music upon the waters
sounds further, and more harmoniously than upon the Land; so do prayers
joined with tears, R. Obad. Gaon in Psalm. 6.
Portae Lachrymarum ne sint clausae, let not the wounds of godly sorrow be ever
so healed up in us, but that they may bleed afresh upon every just occasion.

Verse. 9. The Lord has heard my supplication] And thereby sealed up sweetest
love to my Soul; as Ahashuerus afterward did to his Hester, by granting her
request. But how knew David, and how may another man in like sort know that God
has heard his prayer, though as yet no visible return appears?

I answer; This he may know.

1 By a cast of Gods pleased countenance.

2 By the testimony of his own Conscience, Phil. 4.6, 7. and by the assurance
of faith, which faith to a man as the Angel once did to Cornelius, Thy prayers
are heard and answered. Of Luther we read, that having been once wrestling hard
with God by prayer, for the prosperous proceeding of the Reformation in
Germany, about which there was a general meeting of the States at that time, he
came leaping out of his Closet with Vicimus, Vicimus, in his mouth, that is, we
have prevailed, we have got the day. God sometimes answers his people before
they pray, sometimes whiles they are praying, as here, and sometimes after they
have prayed, but sooner or later they shall be sure of it.

The Lord will receive my prayer] He has, and therefore he will. This is the
Language of faith, this is the triumph of trust.

Verse. 10. Let all mine enemies be ashamed] When they see all their hopes of my
death and downfall disappointed.

Let them return] Retrocedant and in terram cadant, says the Arabic
Interpreter, let them go backward, and fall to the earth. Some make this a
Prayer, some a Prophecy, it comes all to one.

And be ashamed suddenly] Let them be double ashamed, or debosht, and that in a
moment. These sudden and still revenges are very terrible. God usually
premonisheth before he punishes; but not always. Now as blessings the more
unexpected, the more welcome; so Judgments, the more sudden, the more grievous.

PSALM. VII.
SHiggaion of David] i.e. David's delight, or solace, say some: his mixed Song,
or Synodee, say others.

Which he sang unto the Lord] He could sing away care, and punish his
Reproachers with a merry contempt, as knowing his own innocence; the property
whereof is to throw off slanders, as Paul did the Viper, yea in an holy
scorning, it laughs at them, as the wild Ass does at the Horse, and his Rider.

Concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite] which some take to be some Cosen
and Courtier of Saul's, who had falsely accused good David (far from any such
thought, Psalm. 131.1.) of affecting the Kingdom, and seeking Saul's life. See 1 Samuel 24.10. But I rather understand with the Chaldee Paraphrast, Saul's self,
who was of Kish, and of Jemini, 1 Samuel 9.1. and that by a disguise of name; he
is called Cush the Benjamite, that is an Ethiopian, because of his obstinate
impenitency, according to Jer. 13.23. So Am. 9.7. Rebellious Israel is to God
as Aethiopia. Professors shall be as deep in Hell, and deeper than Turks and
Infidels, because of their dissembled sanctity, which is double iniquity, Wrath
shall be upon the Jew first, Romans 2. and when the foul sinner goes to Hell,
what shall become of the fair Professor? may such be asked, as are both in one.
In the Ethiopian is nothing white but his teeth: so in an Hypocrite, etc.

Verse. 1. O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust] Or, I betake me to thee for
safety. David found it always best to run to the old Rock, Isa. 26.4. and to
cry, O Lord my God, pleading the Covenant. This, no wicked man can do; but,
being beaten out of earthly comforts, he is as a naked man in a storm, and an
unarmed man in the field, or as a ship tossed in the Sea without an Anchor,
which presently dasheth on the Rocks, or falls upon the Quicksands. Saul for
instance, who being in distress, and forsaken of God, ran first to the Witch,
and then to the Swords point.

Save me from all them that persecute me] Where the Prince is a Persecutor (as
in the Primitive times, and here in the Marian days) many will be very active
against Gods people, O sancta simplicitas, said John Husse Martyr, when at the
stake he observed a plain Country-fellow busier than the rest, in fetching
Faggots.

Verse. 2. Lest he tear my Soul like a Lion] i. e. put me to a cruel and
tormentful death; exercising against me both cruelty, and also craft; by taking
me at such a time, as there is none to deliver me?

Verse. 3. O Lord my God] See on Verse. 1.

If I have done this] i.e. This treachery and treason, whereof Saul does
causelessly suspect me, and wherewith his pick-thank Partisans unjustly charge
me. As for Sedition, says Latimer, for ought that I know, methinks I should
not need Christ, if I might so say. But where malice bears mastery, Sermon. 3.
before K. Ed. 6.
the doing of any thing, or of nothing, is alike dangerous.

If there be iniquity in my hands] Heb. in the palms of my hands, where it may
be concealed. If I have secretly acted against my Sovereign.

Verse. 4. If I have rewarded evil, etc.] If I have broke the conditions of our
reconciliation, or betrayed my trust.

Yea I have delivered him that, etc.] This was true Christianity, to overcome
evil with good, Matthew. 5.44, etc. Romans 12.17, etc. O quam hoc non est emnium! O
how few can skill of this! Elisha made the Syrians a Feast, who came to make
him a Grave. David spared Saul, and delivered him, not without the hazard of
his own life. Bradford conducted Bourn from the Pulpit at Paul's Cross, (where
he had cried up Popery at the coming in of Queen Mary) safe to his Lodging. A
certain Gentleman said unto him, Ah, Bradford, Bradford, thou savest him that
will help to burn thee. I give thee his life, if it were not for thee, I would
run him through with my sword. And it proved as the Gentleman had Prophesied.
There he sits, I mean my Lord of Bath, Mr. Bourn (said Bradford in his third
Examination before Stephen Gardener) which desired me himself for the Passion
of Christ, I would speak to the people. Upon whose words, I coming into the
Pulpit, I had like to have been slain with a Dagger which was hurled at him, I
think, for it touched my sleeve. He then prayed me I would not leave him, and I
promised, that as long as I lived I would take hurt before him that day: And so
went I out of the Pulpit, and entreated with the people, and at length brought
him my self into an house. Besides this, in the afternoon I preached in Bow
Church, and there going up into the Pulpit, one willed me not to reprove the
people; For, quoth he you shall never come down alive if you do it. And yet in
that Sermon I did reprove their Fact, and called it Sedition at least twenty
times. For all which my doing I have received this recompense, Prison for a
year and half, and more, and Death now, which you (my Lord of Bath among the
rest) go about. Acts and Mon. fol. 146^
Let all men be judge where Conscience is. Thus Master Bradford, like another
David in his own defense.

Verse. 5. Let the enemy persecute my Soul, and take it] Thus he clears
himself by an holy imprecation. (The Spanish Bible has for Shiggaion Davidis
in the Title, Purgatio Davidis, as the same Hebrew word (...) signifies both
Sin, and Purification from sin, Psalm. 51.) taking God to witness of his
innocence and good Conscience, and wishing evil to himself, if it were
otherwise. This he did from a good cause, in a good manner, and for a good end.
And not as many profane ones do now adays, who taxed, though never so truly,
with some evil they have done, seek to justify themselves by appealing to God,
and calling for his Curse upon them, if guilty, who therefore strikes such
impudent imprecatours immediately, as Anne Averies and others. See Mr. Clarks
Mirror.

And tread down my life] Heb. My lives; so usually called, says an
Interpreter, for the many faculties and operations that are in life, the many
years, degrees, estates thereof.

And lay mine honor in the dust. Selah] Let him brand me for a most
treacherous ignominious wretch, and let me lie buried in a bog of indeleble
infamy.

Verse. 6. Arise O Lord in thine anger] Here David repeateth, and re-inforceth
his Suit, filling his mouth with Arguments for that purpose, such as he well
knew would be of avail.

Lift up thy self, etc.] Wherein they deal proudly be thou above them, to
control and overtop them.

And awake for me] Sometimes God seems to be asleep, we must awake him; to
forget, we must in-mind him; to have lost his mercy, we must find it for him.
Where is thy zeal, and thy strength? etc. Isa. 53.

To the Judgment that thou have commanded] That is, promised, viz. that thou will command deliverances out of Zion. Or, which thou have commanded to men in
case of wrong done, to releeve the oppressed, and wilt no^ thou for me, great
Judge, much more do it?

Verse. 7. So shall the Congregation of the people compass thee about;] As
people love to flock to Assizes, or such places of Judicature where Sentence is
passed upon Great ones that have offended. Or thus, then shall the public
sincere Service of God be set up, and people shall fly to it, as the Doves do
to their windows.

For their sakes therefore return thou on high] Seat thy self upon thy
Tribunal, and do justice; q. d. Thou have seemed to come down from the Bench,
as it were, and to have no care of Judgment; but go up once again, and declare
thy power. Reverteid est ostende manum tuam esse altam, return, that is, show
that thou have an high hand, says R. Solomon.

Verse. 8. The Lord shall judge the people] The Ethiopian Judges leave the
chief Seat ever empty, as acknowledging that God is the chief Judge.

According to my righteousness] viz. In this particular Crime, whereof I am
accused; great is the confidence of a good Conscience toward God. Such only can
abide by the everlasting burnings.

Verse. 9. O let the wickedness, etc.] Put a stop to their rage and rancour.

But establish the just] The overthrow of the one will be a strengthening to
the other; as it was betwixt the House of Saul and David, 2 Samuel 3.1. But who
are just?

The righteous God tries the hearts and reins] i. e. The thoughts and
affections or lusts of people, Gogitarlonum and cupiditatum. Junius.
and accordingly esteems of them: for Men's cujusque is est quisque and God
judges of a man according to the hidden man of his heart.

Verse. 10. My defense is of God] Heb. My Buckler is upon God. See the Note on
Psalm. 3.3.

Which saves the upright in heart] Of which number I know my self to be one;
and do therefore look for his Salvation.

Verse. 11. God is angry with the wicked every day] Or, all day long, they are
under the arrest of his wrath, and liable to the wrath to come. Children they
are of wrath, because of disobedience. One renders it, God troubles them;
scil. by laying continually some Judgment or other upon them; and yet there is
no cause to fear (as the Heathen did of his Jupiter) that he should be
exhausted. Si quoties peccent homines, etc.

Verse. 12. If he turn not] scil. Inspius ab impietate su^^ says R. Solomon. If
the wicked turn not from his wickedness, by true and timely repentance.

He will whet his Sword, he has bent his Bow] i. e. God will, God has; and
mark that he whets before he strikes, and is bending his Bow, setting his
Arrows, preparing his Instruments of death; all which must needs take up some
time, and so give fair warning to these foul Sinners, if they have grace to
make use of it. See the like Deuteronomy. 32.41, 42. God first whets his Sword, before
he devours flesh, and first takes hold on Judgment, before his Judgment take
hold of men. But if this be not observed and improved, Patientia Dei qu^
diuturnior (...) est minaci^r; and what shall wicked men plead for themselves,
when God shall say to them as Reuben once did to his Brethren, Genesis 42.22. Did
not I warn you, saying, Sin not?

Verse. 13. He has also prepared, etc.] The punishment of ungodly persons is
here elegantly set forth by Three Similitudes.

1 From Warfare.

2 From Childbirth, verse. 14.

3 From Hunting, verse. 15, 16. Well might the Lord say, I have used Similitudes
by the Ministry of the Prophets, Hos. 12.10. See the Note there.

He ordains his Arrows against the Persecutors] Heb. Ardemes, Importing (...)
have to perpetra^^ mischief.
The hot burning Persecutors, that are set on work by the great red Dragon.
Such were Felix of Wartemburg, who swore that ere he dyed he would ride up to
the Spurs; and Fornesius, who vowed that he would ride up to the Saddle-skirts
in the blood of the Lutherans. The Archbishop of Toures made suit for the
erection of a Court called Chamber Ardent, wherein to condemn the French
Protestants to the fire. Act., and Mon. 1911.
But ere he dyed he had fire enough, for he was stricked with a Disease called
The Fire of God; which began at his feet, and so ascended upward, that he
caused one Member after another to be cut off, and so he dyed miserably. This
was Gods burning Arrow against a hot burning Persecutor. The like may be said
of Dioclesian that bloody Tyrant, who had his house burnt over his head with
fire from Heaven; Eusebius. l. 5.
wherewith he was so affrighted that he dyed soon after. The abovementioned
Count Felix of Wartemburg was, the same night that he had so vowed and vaunted,
Illyric.
choked in his own blood. So he rode not, but bathed himself, not up to the
Spurs but Throat, not in the Lutherans blood, but in his own, before he dyed.
And the like we read of Charles the ninth of France.

Verse. 14. Behold he travelleth with iniquity] Heb. He shall travel, or he
continually travelleth; he takes as great pains to go to Hell, as a traveling
woman does to be delivered.

And has conceived mischief] See Job 15.35. with the Note.

And brought forth falshood] Or, a Lie, that is, a disappointment. See Isa.
26.18. R. Solom.
The Jews have a Proverb, Quicquid genuit mendacium, dispellit maledictio.

Verse. 15. He made a Pit, and dug it, etc.] This Simile shows, that the
wicked shall not only be frustrated, but undone by their own doing; as was
Absalom, Haman, our Powder-Papists, Pope Alexander the Sixth, and his Son
Caesar Borgia; Bucholcor.
who, by a mistake of the attendants at Table, drank up the impoysoned Wine
which they had prepared, and set ready for some Princes of Italy whom they had
invited, and for whose Dominions they thirsted. Hic aut Caesar aut nullus,
says Pontanus, who relates the History. Pentan. de prud. Herodot.


Verse. 16. His mischief shall return upon his own head] As the Thracians Arrows
did, which they in a rage (because it rained upon them unseasonably) shot up
against Heaven.

And his violent dealing upon his own pate] i.e. abundantly, and apparently.
Diverse instances might be given hereof. Henry the Third of France was stabbed
in the same Chamber, where he had helped to contrive the French Massacre. His
Brother Charles the Ninth, had blood given him to drink, for he was worthy: Quem
sitiit vivens scelerata mente cruor^m,
Perfidus hunc moriens Carolus ore vomit.


John Martin of Briquer as in France, vaunted every where, Act. and Mon. fol.
871.
that he would slit the Ministers Nose of Angr^gne; But he was shortly after
assaulted by a Woolf, which bit off his Nose, so that he dyed thereof mad.
Dispatch the Knave, have done, (said Sir Ralph Ellerken Governor of Callice,
to the Executioner of Adam Davilip Martyr) for I will not away till I see the
Traitors Heart out. But shortly after; Ibid. 112^.
the said Sir Ralph in a Skirmish betwixt the French and us at Bulloin, was
among others slain, and had his Heart ripped out by the enemy. That was a very
remarkable one of Dr. Story, who escaping out of Prison in Queen Elizabeth's
days, got to Antwerp, and there thinking himself out of the reach of Gods Rod,
he got Commission under Duke D^ Alva, to search all Ships coming thither for
English Books. But one Parker an English Merchant trading to Antwerp, laid his
Snare fair, Speed, 1174.
(says our Chronicler) to catch this foul Bird, causing secret notice to be
given to Story, that in his Ship werestore of Heretical Books, with other
intelligences that might stand him in stead. The Canonist conceiving that all
was cock-sure, hasted to the Ship, where with looks very big upon the poor
Mariners, each Cabin, Chest, and corner above-board were searched, and some
things found to draw him further on; so that the Hatches must be opened, which
seemed to be unwillingly done, and great signs of fear was showed by their
faces. This drew on the Doctor to descend into the Hold, where now in the Trap
the Mouse might well gnaw, but could not get out; for the Hatches were down,
and the Sails hoised up, which with a merry gale were blown into England, where
ere long he was arraigned, and Condemned of High Treason, and accordingly
executed at Tiburn, as he had well deserved.

Verse. 17. I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness] i.e. His
faithfulness in keeping promise with his people, and with my self in
particular. I will say to his honor, as Deuteronomy. 32.4. A God of truth, and
without iniquity, just and right is he. And will sing praise to the name, etc.]
Where the Psalmist mentions the overthrow of the wicked. Laus praecedit and
sequitur (says R. Joshua Ben Levi here) as in this place, and Psalm 9.

PSALM. VIII.
TO the chief Musician upon Gittith] Upon the Cittern, or Gittern brought from
Gath, says the Chaldee Paraphrast; or that was used by the Sons of Obed-Edom
the Gittite, 2 Samuel 6.10. or, that was sung at the Wine-presses, as the Greek
has it, for a thanksgiving in time of Vintage. This last Aben-Ezra disliketh,
though I see no reason why he should.

Verse. 1. Vani homines exponunt de torculari. Ab. Ezra.
O Lord, our Lord etc.] The scope of this whole Psalm is, to set us a wondering
at, and magnifying the Majesty and Magnificence of the Almighty; together with
his inexpressible goodness to Mankind;

1 In our Creation in Adam.

2 In our Restoration by Christ: which last is the true end of this Psalm, as
appears Mat. 21.15. 1 Cor. 15.27. and Heb. 2.8.

How excellent is thy Name] This, David speaks as one swallowed up with
admiration at that Nomen illud Magnificum and Majestativum, that Glory, Honor,
Power, Wisdom, Goodness, etc. that being invested in God, and manifested in the
Creature (Gods Handiwork) should make us both wonder and inquire into Gods
excellencies, (...) Arist. Rhet. lib. 1. cap. 11
according to that of Aristotle, to admire, and learn at once is a pleasant
thing: and sure that which is admirable, stirs up desire to see further into
it. Admiratio peperit Philosophiam, says another, Admiration brought forth
Philosophy; let it breed devotion in us, and a desire to praise God, who has
therefore displayed his excellencies in his Works, that we might give him his
due glory. The Angels shouted at the Creation, Job 38.4, 5, 6, and shall we be
dull, and dumb? God tells Job of his own great Works, (the Elephant, and Whale
especially) and thereby brings him to a right temper. The Elephant is in
Chaldee called Pil, of a word that signifies Wonderful; because the Wonders of
Gods glory do so marvellously appear in him. See Job 40.15, 16, etc with the
Notes. The Philosophers make Iris, Plate.
or the Rainbow, the Daughter of Thaumas, or Admiration; but because that when
they knew God, scil. Per species Creaturarum, they glorified him not as God,
neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations -- therefore were
they given up to a reprobate sense, Romans 1.21.28.

In all the earth?] Where a man cannot look beside a Miracle, so full of God
are all places.

Who have set thy glory above the Heavens] Nam in eis robu^ Dei maxim apparet;
for in the Heavens (how much more above them) does the glory of God chiefly
appear: the Earth is a small point in comparison of the Heavens, and is
governed by them, as R. David here notes.

Verse. 2. Out of the mouth of Babes and sucklings] For whom, God has filled
two Bottles of Milk against they come into the World: and in whose birth,
sustenance, and wonderful protection (for Puerilitas est periculorum pelagus)
but especially in their holy and religious education, much of Gods Providence,
Power, and Goodness is clearly seen and set forth to the conviction of the
vilest Atheists. So that, besides the Earth and the Heavens, we have very
Infants Preachers of Gods praises, and more effectual Orators than ever were
Isocrates, Demosthenes, Pericles, etc. so our Savior understands it, Mat.
21.10. where the Children sang Hosanna when the Pharisees were silent. It is
sometimes seen, that Ipsa Deo blandos fundant cunabula flores.

John Baptist sprang in the Womb for joy of Jesus. Hierom writes of Paula,
that noble Matron, that she rejoiced in nothing more than this, That she heard
her Niece Paula sing Hallelujah in her Cradle. Bellarmine tells us out of
Theodoret, In cunis cunis ba^^ butienti lin^^ Hallelujah Cantare. Hi^^
that the Children of Samosatena playing at Tennis-ball in the midst of the
Market, did solemnly cast it into the fire, because it had but touched the foot
of the Ass, whereon Lucius the Heretical Bishop rode. The Children of Merindal
so posed, and answered one another, in matters of Religion, before the
persecuting Bishop of Cavaillon, that a religious man that stood by said unto
the Bishop, I must needs confess that I have often been at the Disputation of
the Doctors in Sorbon, Act and Mon^^ fol. 865. Ibid. 1156.
but yet I never learned so much as I have done by hearing these young
children. When Mr. Blecter the Bishops Chaplain told Mr. Wisehart the Scotch
Martyr, that he had a Devil in him, and the spirit of Error; a Child that
stood by answered him, saying, A Devil cannot speak such words as yonder man
speaks. At the burning of John Laurence at Colchester, as he was sitting in
the fire (for stand he could not, he had been so hardly used in the Prison) the
young Children came about the fire, and cried, Lord, strengthen thy Servant,
and keep thy promise. Ibid. 1403.
Here was strength out of the mouths of little ones, taught betime to speak
the language of Canaan. Sed vae vae parentibus illis (says Polanus on the
Text) But woe, woe to those Parents who make their Children (whom God would have
to be witnesses of his Majesty) witnesses of their impiety, pride, and vanity.

That thou might still the enemy and the avenger] i.e. Silence Atheists and
Persecutors.

Verse. 3. When I consider thy Heavens] And that men should be much in this
consideration, both the bolt-upright figure of their bodies may monish them,
and also that fifth Muscle which God has set in Man's eye (whereas other
Creatures have but four) to draw it upward, Ut ejus auxilio coelum intueremur,
says the Anatomist, that by the help thereof we might consider the Heavens.
This, Columb. de re Anatom. l. 5. c. 9.
those Christians that do not, shall have those Heathens rising up in Judgment
against them. Anaxagoras Clazomenius, who used to say, that he was therefore
born that he might contemplate the Heavens. And Ennius, who blames Epicurus
for that Dum palato quid sit optimum judicaret, coeli palatium non suspexerit,
he did so purvey for his Palate, that he looked not up to Heavens Palace.
Certain it is, that many men have so much to do upon Earth, that they cannot
have while to cast an eye toward Heaven, as the Duke of Alva told a great
Prince, who asked him if he had taken notice of the last Eclips. That wonderful
Globe of Silver sent by King Ferdinand to Solomon the great Turk, lively
expressing the wonderful motions, Turk. Hist. 71
and conversions of the Caelestial frame, the hourly passing of the Time, the
Change and Full of the Moon, etc. was much more beheld and admired, than Heaven
it self is by most people. True it is, that that Globe was a most curious and
strange Piece of Work, devised and perfected by the most cunning Astronomers,
for Maximilian the Emperor, whose noble mind never spared for any cost to
obtain things of rare and strange devise. But what was all this to the Heavens?
That

Work of Gods finger] That is, most elaborate and accurate; a Metaphor from
Embroyderers, or from them that make Tapestry. Aben-Ezra's Note here is, Digiti
sunt december, and sphaera sunt december, As there are ten Fingers, so there are ten
Spheres, etc.

The Moon and the Stars] No mention of the Sun, because included in this word
Heaven; wherein by Day the Sun is most conspicuous, as by Night, the Moon and
Stars.

Which thou have ordained] That was a witty speech of Cyril, They were (...)
Athiests by Night, who worshipped the Sun, and Atheists by Day, who worshipped
the Moon and Stars.

Verse. 4. What is man that thou art mindful of him?] Sorry, sickly man, a Mass
of Mortalities, a Map of Miseries, a mixture or compound of Dirt and Sin? And
yet God is mindful of him; he not only takes care of him in an ordinary way, as
he does other Creatures, but singularly attends, and affects him, as a
Father does his dearest Child. Heis, Divini ingenii cura, says one; he is the
end of all in a semicircle, says another Philosopher; meaning, that all
things in the World were made for man, and man made for God: Neither is there
so much of the glory of God in all his Works of Wonder, as in one gracious
performance of a godly person. But if we understand the Text (as the Apostle
does, Heb. 2.6.) of the Man Christ Jesus, Hic homo and filius hominis qualis
and quantus est, Deus bone! says Junius.

And the Son of Man] Heb. Arrian in Epictet.
Of earthly men; for what is the greatest Potentate, but (...) a piece of Clay
neatly made up?

That thou visitest him?] That thou mindest him more than other Creatures, and
make him Lord of all? thy visitation preserves his spirit, Job 10.12.

Verse. 5. For thou have made hima little lower than the Angels] Compare here
with Heb. 2.6, 7. and it will appear that whatsoever is spoken here of man, is
applied to Christ, and so is proper to the Saints, by virtue of their union
with Christ; in which respect they are more glorious, says one, than Heaven,
Angels, or any Creature. This is their dignity: and for their duty they must
therefore give the more earnest heed to the Doctrine of the Gospel, lest at any
time they should leak, or let slip the same, but retain and obey it. This is
the Apostles own inference, Heb. 2.5, 6, 7. for thus he argues: Unto the
Angels God has not put in subjection the World to come, where of we speak; But
to man (for whose sake the Son of God came in the flesh, for whose sake the
Gospel was preached, for whose sake we speak of that World to come) he has;
therefore it behooveth man to observe, and obey the Gospel.

And have crowned him with glory and honour] Some refer this to the reasonable
Soul, whereby he not only differs from Beasts, but draws nigh to the
heavenly Nature. As Rome was an Epitome of the World; as Athens was the Greece
of Greece; and as one said to his Friend who desired to see Athens, Viso Solone
vidisti omnia, when thou have seen Solon thou have seen all Athens: So man is a
little World, and is therefore called every Creature, Mark 16, 15. and the
Saints (in whom Gods Image is repaired) are called All things, Colos. 1.20.
Christ being unto them All, and in all.

Verse. 6. Thou made him to have dominion, etc.] He had so at first, Genesis
1.26. and shall have again, Zech. 8.12. Rev. 21.7. mean while (though Rebellis
facta est Creatura homini, quia homo numini, the Creature rebelleth against
man, because man does against God; yet) we cannot but see some footsteps
remaining of that ancient Sovereignty, Tully. Plutarch. E^ncus.
which the very Heathens also acknowledged, and there-hence fetched excellent
Arguments for a Providence. Lions hate Apes, but fear men; though Simia quam
similis, turpissima bestia, nobis: Hereof no probable reason can be given but
this, That God has put all things under man's feet; insomuch as that the most
timorous men dare kick and beat the hugest Elephants. Indeed by reason of Sin,
as was said, we see not all things subdued. Heb. 12.8. But why has Nature
denied to Horses, Bodin. Theat. Not. p 405.
Asses, Camels, Elephants. Deer, etc. a Gall, which it has given to Lions,
Wolves, and other fierce Creatures? Surely herein appears the wonderful
Wisdom and goodness of God; who has done this, that those so serviceable
Creatures might be the better tamed, and subdued by man. Let man consider
(says one well) what excellency he has lost through Adams fall, and bewail
his misery. Let him also on the other side well weigh the grace bestowed on him
in Christ, and be joyful and thankful or mercy; knowing this, that if the
Creatures be not now subjected unto us, it is by reason of the Body and relics
of Sin, that yet remain in us; and that therefore if we would have a conquest
over the Creatures, we must begin first to get a victory upon sin, or else we
shall never profit that way.

Thou have put all things under his feet] The Earth has its name from treading
upon it; teaching us, Terra a teendo.
1 To trample upon earthly things, as base and bootless; not to dote upon them
with out hearts, nor grasp them over greedily with our hands: as that covetous
Cardinal Sylberperger, who took so great felicity in Money, that when he was
grievously tormented with the Gout, his only remedy to ease his pain was, to
have a Basin full of Gold set before him, into which he would put his lame
hands, turning the Gold upside down. But if Silver and Gold be a man's
happiness, then it is in the earth, and so (which is strange) nearer Hell than
Heaven, and so nearer the Devil than God. The ancient Romans had for a
difference in their Nobility, a little ornament in the form of a Moon, to show
that all worldly things were mutable; and they wore it upon their shoes, to
show that they trod all under their feet. 2. By this posture of all things
sunder man's feet, God would teach him to use them as a Stirrup, for the raising
of his heart to those things above. A sanctified fancy can make every Creature
a Ladder to Heaven, and say with that Father, Si tanti vitreum, quanti verum
margaritum? If this trash be so highly esteemed of, how much more the true
Treasure?

Verse. 7. All Sheep and Oxen, etc.] There are Beasts ad esum et ad usum, says
one. Some are profitable dead, not alive, as the Hog; some alive, not dead,
as the Dog, Horse, etc. some both, as the Ox; yet none so profitable as the
Sheep, who has Wool for Raiment, Skin for Parchment, Flesh for Meat, Guts for
Music, and was therefore in Sacrifice so frequently offered.

Verse. 8. The Fowl of the air] These Moses seems to have forgot, in that
discontented speech of his, Numb. 11.22. but God sent those murmurers such a
drift of Quails (meat of Kings, with their bread of Angels) as he could not
have imagined, or hoped for.

And the Fish of the Sea] Piscis of Pasco. Many Islands are maintained, and
people fed by Fish. In Hebrew the same word signifies a Pond, or Fish-pool,
and a Blessing. And surely it is a blessing to any Country that they have
plenty, and dainty, of these good Creatures,

And whatsoever passes, etc.] As Whales, and other great Fishes, which make a
smooth path in a calm Sea, as a Ship or Boat does, Job 41.23, etc. See the Note
there.

Verse. 9. O Lord, our Lord, etc.] Prius incipit Propheta mirari quam loqui, and
desinit loqui non mirari. The Psalmist ends as he began, transported with an
ecstasy of admiration. So he begins, and ends many of his Psalms with
Hallelujah. Betwixt God and us the distance is infinite; and if it were
possible our love and thankfulness should fill up that distance, and extend it
self to infiniteness, says a grave Divine.

PSALM. IX.
Upon Muth-Labbon] This was the name of a certain Instrument, say some; the
beginning of a Song, say others, to the tune whereof this Psalm was to be
sung. Montanus, and many more hold it to be an Annagramatism, and render it,
For the death of Nabal, viz. by a covert intimation, and inversion of the
Letters. So in the Title of Psalm. 7. Cush Benjemini, for Kish the Benjamite.
This is,

Parcere nominibus, dicere de vitiis.

Verse. 1. I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart] This is a
gratulatory Psalm, wherein David shows his thankfulness, Cic.
which a very Heathen calls Maximam imo matrem omnium virtutum reliquaram,
the Mother of all the rest of the Virtues. True thankfulness, as one well
observes, is here and in the next verse described,

1 By the matter of it.

2 By the manner.

First, for matter, the Psalmist delivers it in Four parcels. Of (...) seems
to come Cipher.


1 The acknowledging of God in all.

2 A Ciphering, and summing up of special Mercies.

3 An expression of Spiritual joy in God, as well as in his Gifts.

4 A dedication of our Songs and selves to his Name.

Secondly, For the manner, he presses

1 Integrity for the subject, and object, verse. 1,

2 Sincerity for affection, and end, verse. 2.

I will be glad and rejoice in thee] Spiritual cheerfulness is the Mother of
Thankfulness, Jam. 5.13. Birds when got in the air, or on the top of trees, and
have taken up a stand to their mind, sing most sweetly.

O thou most High] God was so first called by Melchisedeck, upon a like
occasion, as here by David, Genesis 14.19, 20. The Greeks might have their (...),
for the Sun which they worshipped, from this Hebrew Helion most High.

Verse. 3. When mine enemies] This, Tremellius makes to be the form of praise
which the Psalmist professes, that he will sing to God, and rendereth it thus,
That mine enemies returning back are fallen, etc.

And perish at thy presence] The victory is of God, and to him alone to be
ascribed. The Romans in their Triumphs presented a Palm to Jupiter. The
Graecians also thankfully ascribed to Jupiter their deliverance from the
Persians, wrought by Themistocles, and there-hence called him (...), that is,
Deliverer.

Verse. 4. For thou have maintained my right] Heb. Thou have done me judgment.
Locus hic in signis est, says Polanus: this is an excellent place, and makes
much to the comfort of Gods poor people that are oppressed by the World ^ the
righteous Judge will not fail to right them. See Luke 18.7, 8.

Verse. 5. Thou have rebuked the Heathen, etc.] God first chideth the Churches
Enemies by lighter Judgments; if these be not improved, he destroys them,
Psalm. 119.21. and because they sought to obscure and extirpate his name from
amongst men, therefore he puts out their name, that is, their fame and
reputation for ever and yet, or for ever and a day, as we use to say: --
Ingloria vita recedit, they go out in a snuff, as did the Primitive and Modern
Persecutors, of abhorred memory.

Verse. 6. O thou enemy] The same whom he called Wicked one in the former verse;
where the word Wicked is of the singular number, q. d. O thou implacable
Wretch, that would never be reconciled till thou wast ruined; which now thou
art, etc. Some read it interrogatively, and withal ironically, O enemy, are
destructions come to an end? and Cities so wasted that they can never be
repaired? q. d. So indeed thou have designed it, but art fairly disappointed.
And the like besel Antiochus, Nero, Dioclesian, Philip the Second of Spain,
Charles the Ninth of France, and other bloody Persecutors, with their devilish
thoughts and threats; which they could never effect and accomplish.

Their memorial is perished with them] Heb. Of them, of them (twice) for more
vehemence. The vulgar (after the Greek) has it cum sonitu, with an humming
noise, so that the sound thereof ringeth all the World over. R. David renders
it, Memoria eorum periit; suntne illi? Their memorial is perished; have they
yet a being any where?

Verse 7. But the Lord shall endure for ever] Vivit Christus regnatque alioqui
totus desperassem, said that good Dutch Divine, upon the view of the Churches
enemies, i.e. Christ lives and reigns for ever, setting one foot on the
earth, and the other on the sea, as Lord of both; otherwise I should have been
altogether hopeless. Blessed be God that he is God, was a learned Divines
motto.

Verse. 8. And he shall judge the world, etc.] See on verse. 4.

Verse. 9. The Lord also will be a refuge, etc.] Heb. An high tower, edita arx,
wherein men are secured, and escape the impressions of an enemy. The very Lame
and Blind, those most shiftless Creatures, when they had gotten the strong
Hold of Zion over their heads, thought that then they might securely scorn
David and his Host, 2 Samuel 5.6, 7. yet their Hold failed them: So did the Tower
of Shechem those that ran into it. Not so the Almighty, his poor oppressed.
Universal experience seals to this truth; neither can one instance be given
of the contrary; Higgaion, Selah. It is reported of the (...), that living in
the Fens, and being vexed with Gnats, Herod. Lib. 2.
they use to sleep in high Towers, whereby, those Creatures not being able to
soar so high, they are delivered from the biting of them: So would it be with
us when bitten with cares and fears, did we but run to God for refuge, and rest
confident of his help.

Verse. 10. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee] They can
do no otherwise that savingly know Gods sweet Attributes, and noble Acts for
his people. We never trust a man till we know him, and bad men are better known
than trusted. Not so the Lord, for where his name is poured out as an ointment,
there the Virgins love him, fear him, rejoice in him, repose upon him.

Them that seek thee] So they do it seriously, seasonably, constantly.

Verse. 11. Sing praises to the Lord, etc.] This is the guise of godly people,
to provoke others to praise God, as being unsatisfiable in their desires of
doing him that service, and as deeming that others see him as they do totum
totum desiderabilem, worthy to be praised, Psalm. 18.3. highly to be admired,
verse. 1. of this Psalm.

Verse. 12. When he makes inquisition for bloud] for innocent blood unjustly
spilled; as he did for the blood of Abel, Genesis 4.10. of Naboth (1 King. 9.26.
surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth; Murder ever bleeds fresh in
the eyes of God) of Zechariah the Son of Barachiah, 2 Chronicles. 24.22. those
ungrateful Guests, who slew those that came to call them; And when the King
heard it (for Blood cries aloud) he was wroth, and destroyed those Murderers,
Matthew. 22.6, 7. These shall have blood to drink; for they are worthy, Revel.
16.6. God draws Articles of enquiry in this case as strict, and as critical, as
ever the Inquisition of Spain does; the proceedings whereof are with greatest
secrecy, and severity.

He forgets not the cry of the Humble] Heb. of the poor, lowly, meek,
afflicted. Humility and Meekness are Collactancae, twin-sisters, as Bernard
has it.

Verse. 13. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, etc.] These are the words (say some) of
those humble ones whom God forgets not; they were Gods remembrancers. See
Isa. 62.6. or, it is a prayer of David for further deliverances, according to
that, I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised, Psalm. 18.3.
Betwixt praising and praying he divided his time, and drove an holy trade
between Heaven and Earth.

Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death] i.e. Ex praesentissimo and
certissimo interitu, from desperate and deadly dangers, such as threaten
present destruction; and show a man the Grave even gaping for him. David was
often at this pass; and God delivered Paul from so great a death, 2 Cor. 1.10. he
commonly reserveth his hand for a dead lift, and rescueth those who were even
talking of their Graves.

Verse. 14. That I may show forth all thy praises] i.e. All that I can compass
or attain unto: Aliter omnes lauds Dei dici non possunt, quia plures ignorant
home quam novit, says R. David here: for all the praises of God cannot be
shown forth; since those we know not are more than those we know.

In the gates of the daughter of Zion.] These are opposed to the Gates of
Death, as Aben-Ezra here notes; and betoken the most public places, and best
frequented.

Verse. 15. The Heathen are sunk down, etc.] Hoc est initium cantici Sanctorum,
says Aben-Ezra. This is the beginning of the Saints Song, knit to the former
verse thus: saying, The Heathen, etc.

In the Net which they bid, etc.] To Hunters, they are compared for cruelty,
and to Fowlers for craft. But see their success, they are sunk down in their
own pit, caught in their own Net. Thus it befell Pharaoh, Exodus 15.9, 10.
Jabin, and Sicera, Judge, 4. Sennacherib, 2 Chronicles. 32. Antiochus Epiphanes,
Maxentius the Tyrant, Eusebius. lib. cap.9.
(who fell into the river Tiber, from his own false Bridge laid for Constantine)
The Spanish Armado, our Powder-Papists, etc. See the Note on, Psalm. 7.15.

Verse. 16. The Lord is known by the judgment, etc.] The Heathen Historian
observed, that the ruin of Troy served to teach men, Herod.
that God punishes great sinners with heavy plagues. Go up to Shiloh, etc.

The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands] Heb. Palms, hollows, noting
the close conveyance of his wicked plots and practices, but for his own
mischief.

Higgaion, Selah] Ainsworth renders it Meditation Selah; meaning that this is
a matter of deep meditation, worthy to be well-minded, and spoken, or sung with
earnest consideration always. The word is found only here, and Psalm. 92.3.
where also the wonderful works of God are discoursed. R. Solomon's Note here is,
Ultimum judicium debet esse continua meditatio. The last Judgment should be
continually thought upon.

Verse. 17. The wicked shall be turned into Hell] Heb. into into Hell (twice)
that is into the nethermost Hell, the lowest Dungeon of Hell. The word
L^sh^^lah has a vehement inforcement from (...) local, as Grammarians call
it, and imports, that they shall be cast into outer darkness, August.
In tenebras ex tenebris infeliciter exclusi, infelicius excluden^^. R.
Solomon's Note here is, They shall be carried away from Hell to Judgment, and
from Judgment they shall be returned to the deepest Pit of Hell. This if men
did but believe, they durst not do as they do, as once Cato said to Caesar.

And all the Nations] The wicked be they never so many of them, they may not
think to escape for their multitudes, as amongst Mutineers in an Army, the
tenth man sometimes is punished, the rest go free.

Verse. 18. For the needy shall not always be forgotten] Because he that shall
come will come, and will not tarry. The Lord is at hand to help those that are
forsaken of their hopes. Julian Lining was apprehended by Dale the Promooter
(in Queen Mary's days) who said unto him, You hope, and hope, but your hope
shall be aslope. For though the Queen fail, she that you hope for shall never
come at it; for there is my Lord Cardinals Grace, Act. and Mon. 1871.
and many others between her and it, etc. But the Cardinal dyed soon after the
Queen, and (according to Father Latimers prayer) Elizabeth was crowned, and
England yet once more looked upon.

Verse. 19. Luther.
Arise O Lord, let not man prevail] Prayers are the Churches Weapons, her
Bombards and instrumenta bellica, whereby she is terrible, as an Army with
Banners; she prays down her enemies.

Verse. 20. Put them in fear O Lord] strike them with a panick terror, as once
the Canaanites, Philistines, 2 Samuel 5. Syrians, 2 King. 7. Germans, in the War
against the Hussites, etc. Some read it, Put a Law upon them, bridle them,
bound them as thou have done the Sea, Job 38.11. The Greek and Syriack favor
this reading.

That the Nations may know themselves to be but men] And not gods, as that
proud Prince of Tyrus, Ezekiel. 27. and Antiochus, who would needs be styled
(...), to such an height of pride will Persecutors grow, if they prosper, and
be not taken a link lower, as we say. Home, id est fracti, says R. Obad. on
this Text; Men, that is, broken crackt-creatures, Morbis mortique obnoxii,
woeful weights, sorry and sickly Caitives. This to know savingly, is the
beginning of true Humility, says Augustine here.

PSALM. X.
Verse. 1. Why stand then afar off, O Lord?] As if thou-hadst forgotten what
thou had promised thy people in the former Psalm; which the Greek and Latin
Versions make to be one and the same with this, as having no title, and tending
almost to the same purpose: Hence the difference in Numbers, which holds
almost to the end of the Psalter, viz. to Psalm. 148.

Why hidest thou thy self in time of trouble?) So God seems to do, when he
helps not presently; neither does any thing more trouble the Saints in
affliction, than the want of Gods gracious presence. This makes them thus to
expostulate and lament after the Lord; not quarrel as those Hypocrites did,
Isa. 58.3. or revile, as Caligula did his Jupiter, taking up that Verse in
Homer, (...), or with him (little better) in the holy History, who said, Behold
this evil is of the Lord, and what should I wait for the Lord any longer? 2
King. 6.33. The good Soul knows that God waits to be gracious; and as he
seldom comes at our time, so at his own (which is ever the best) time, he
never fails.

Verse. 2. (...) Chrysostom.
The wicked in his pride does persecute, etc.] Heb. hotly pursues, and that
out of his pride, the true cause of Persecution; whatever else is pretended.
And this is fitly here alleged, and urged as an Argument to move God to make
have. See Deuteronomy. 32.27. The Saints fare the better for the insolences and
outrages of their enemies, whose ruin is thereby accelerated, and somewhat God
will do the sooner for his people, lest the enemy exalt himself, Psalm. 140.8.
and say, Our hand is high, the Lord has not done this.

Let them be taken in the devie^s, etc.] As all Persecutors are sure to be. In
which regard Tertullian well advises Scapula, Si nobis non parcis, tibi parce;
si non tibi, Carthagini. If thou will not spare us Christians, yet spare thy
self; or if not thy self, yet thy City Carthage, which else will smart and
smoke for thy cruelty.

Verse. 3. For the wicked boasts of his hearts desire] Though the Soul of the
wicked desire evil, Prove. 21.10. yet he glories in it, as did that Thrasonical
Lamech, Genesis 4. and that Pyrgopolynices Nebuchadnezzar, Isa. 10.9, 10, 11, 12.
See Psalm. 5 Phil. 3.19.
This the just and jealous God cannot bear, as neither that which follows.

He blesses the Covetous] Vt sapientem and providum, as a wise man and good
Husband. So they in Malachy, who said, And now we count the proud happy, etc.
Felix scelus virtus vocatur.

Whom the Lord abhorreth] smiting his hands with indignation at his dishonest
gain, Ezekiel. 22.13. like as Balac did at Balaam, Seneca^
with whom he was deeply displeased, Numb. 24.10.

Verse. 4. The wicked through the pride of his countendnce] That is, of his
heart, appearing in his countenance; as a master-pock in his forehead. For
Pride buddeth, Ezekiel. 7.10. the pride of Israel testifies to his face, Hos.
5.5. the thoughts are often seen in the countenance; and the heart is printed
upon the face, Isa. 3.9. It Is a hard thing, says one, to have a brazen face,
and a broken heart.

Will not seek] He thinks it not necessary, or worth the while; and his
practice is agreeable, that is, naught all over. Pride in the Soul is like a
great swelling in the body, which (besides that it is a dangerous Symptom)
unfits it for any good service; and is apt to putrify and to break, and to run
with loath some and soul matter: So does Pride disable the Soul from doing
duty, and at last breaks forth into odious deeds, abominable to God and men.
It is observed, that the ground whereon the Peacock uses to sit, is by that
occasion made exceeding barren: so where pride roosteth and reigns, no good
grows.

God is not in all his thoughts] God is neither in his head, as here, nor in
his heart, Psalm. 14.1. nor in his words, Psalm. 12.4. nor in his ways, Tit.
1.16. he is wholly without God in the world, Ephesians. 2. he studies Atheism, and
all his thoughts are, There is no God (so this Text may be read) he would fain
so persuade himself.

Verse. 5. His ways are always grievous] As he Pleases not God, so he is
contrary and vexatious to men, Via ejus semper terrent, so Aben-Ezra. The
Psalmist here notes him, for such an one as the Cyclops are set forth to have
been by the Poets.

Thy Judgments are far above out of his sight] He looks not so high, but
reckons that quae supra nos nihil ad nos. If he read them at any time, he
regards them as little as he does the story of foreign Wars, wherein he is not
concerned.

As for all his enemies, he puffs at them] He holds himself man good enough
to make his party good with them, and that he can overthrow them all with a
puff. He defieth them, and domintereth over them, (...) Chrysostom.
as the Greek renders it.

Verse. 6. He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved] So said a better man
once, Psalm. 30.6. but he was quickly confuted. If a believer conclude by the
force of his faith, that he shall never be moved from that good estate in which
Christ has set him, this is the triumph of trust, and not the vain vaunt of
presumption.

For I shall never be in adversity] The Chaldee has it, Quoniam non sum in
malo; and understands it of the evil of sin, as Exodus 32.22. and then the
sense is, because the wicked man suffers not the punishment of sin, therefore
he conceiteth that he is innocent, and without sin. See Hos. 12.8. with the
Note.

Verse. 7. His mouth is full of cursing and deceit] Such cursing men are cursed
men; and for such slippery and deceitful persons, the Lord is the avenger of
all such; 1 Thessalonians. 4.8.

Under his tongue is mischief] that is, in his heart, which is by Nature placed
beneath the Tongue, making its use of it, for much mischief, Matthew. 12.34. Jam.
3.8. The word Toch here rendered fraud, signifies properly the middle of any
thing, Quoniam fraus in modio cordis est, says R. David, because fraud is in
the middle of the heart, and there-hence sent into the mouth.

Verse. 8. He sits in the lurking-places, etc.] A description of an
High-way-robber, says Diodate, under which name are meant all violent and
fraudulent men, and their actions.

Verse. 9. He lies in wait secretly as a Lion in his den] See Job 38.40. with
the Note.

When he draws him into his Net] that is, into his bonds, debts, morgages,
says Chrysostom. When a poor man is once gotten into these Nets, wicked
Oppressors do not only rob but ravish them; coining their money upon poor men's
skins, and wringing the sponges of poor people into their own purses. David
compares them to Canibals, Sir Richard Berkley his Sum. Bon. 1^3
Psalm. 14.4. to greedy Lions here; another says they are like the fish Polypus
that lying in wait for other fishes upon the Rock, assimulateth to the Rock and
takes them in his Net, which he has naturally behind his head, and can,
spread at his pleasure, before they find themselves in danger.

Verse. 10. He croucheth (or crusheth) and humbles himself] Lyon-like, Job. 38.
40. Scipsum aegrum, and attritum fingit R. David.
He can few the Foxes skin to the Lions hide for a need, and to compass his
design. As proud as he is yet in subtlety he can abase himself; and with
glavering speeches, and fawning behavior, indirectly endeavor the overthrow of
the innocent and distressed. To which purpose he can put himself to pain, feign
himself sick, and in a dying condition (as those do that stand for the
Popedom) counterfeit and pretend humility, but all is Hypocrisy.

That the poor may fall by his strong ones] whether teeth or paws, per impia
decreta, says R. Obadiah, by his wicked decrees, by the hands of his
Privado's, desperate Assassinates, says another Expositor.

Verse. 11. He has said in his heart God has forgotten] that is, he knows
it not, regards it not. To learn is nothing else but to remember, said
Socrates; and what a man has utterly forgotten, it is all one, as if he had
never known it, 2 Pet. 1.9. he has forgotten that he was purged from his old
sins, that is, he was never purged. See verse. 4.

Verse. 12. Arise O Lord, surge, age, sum Pater, said Mantuan to the Pope,
stirring him up against the Turks; may we better say to the Almighty God,
against his peoples enemies. O God lift up thine hand] lift it up on high, that
it may fall down the more heavily. In the first verse of this Psalm, the
Prophet complained that God stood a far off, and hid himself in time of
trouble. Here he is entreated to arise, to come near, to put forth his hand
for his peoples help, etc.

Verse. 13. Wherefore does the Wicked contemn God? q.d. It is time for thee,
Lord, to arise and bestir thy self; for otherwise what will become of thy great
name? The Saints cannot endure that God should be slighted.

He has said in his heart] Verse. 3.4. This sticks in David's stomach, and
draws this prayer from him, who was now blessedly blown up with an holy zeal
for God; as was also good Zuinglius, when he said, In aliis mansuetus ero, in
Blasphemiis in Christum, non ita. In other matters I can be mild and patient,
but not so in case of Blasphemy against Christ.

Verse. 14. Thou have seen it] For thou art All-eye, whatever the wicked
conceiteth to the contrary, making thee a God of clouts, as they say, or an
Heathen-Idoll, which is nothing in the World.

To requite it with thine hand] reponendo in manu tua, by taking it in thy hand
(so some render it) sc. ut propius intnearis, certius consideres, dijudices and
vindices, Aben-Ezra-Relinquit in te ^onus saum. R. Solomon.
that thou may take a more near and narrow view of it, and duly punish it.

The poor commits himself unto thee] Heb. leaves, relinquit scipsum, and
currit ad te, he relinquisheth himself, and runs unto thee. Now whosoever
commits himself, and his affairs to God, shall be sure to find him a
faithful Depositarie.

Thou art the helper of the father lesse] The Worlds Refuge, as the Grand
Signiour is called; The poor man's King, as James 5. of. Scotland. In God the
Fatherless finds mercy, Hos. 14.3. And these Arguments David uses in his
prayer, not to move God to hear and help, but to work upon his own heart
thereby, and to persuade himself to more Faith, Love, Obedience, Humility,
Thankfullness, whereby we are the better fitted for mercy. When a man in a
Ship plucks a Rock, it seems as if he plucked the Rock nearer the ship, when
as indeed the ship is plucked nearer the Rock. So is it in this case; we seem
to persuade God by our Arguments, when as indeed the change is not wrought in
him, but only in our selves; our Arguments are curarum nostrarum levamenta, and
fiducia impetrandi augmenta, the cure of our cares, and props to our faith of
obtaining.

Verse. 15. Break thou the arm of the Wicked] that arm that has been lifted up
against the godly, see Psalm. 3.8. and 58.7.

Seek out his wickedness, that thou find none] ad alios vel inficiendos, vel
infestandos, Ezech. 23.48. Or, leave no sin of his unpunished. The Franciscans,
to prove that Francis the founder of their order was without sin, foolishly
allege this Text, Queretur peccatum ill^us and non inven etur; wherein
(according to the sense of the Psalmist) what do they else but wish that God
would trace him quite through the course and trade of his iniquities, even to
the uttermost end of them, and punish him accordingly; which is done, no doubt,
long since.

Verse. 16. The Lord is King for ever and ever] Therefore he will doubtless do
whatsoever has been before desired, and much more than we can ask or think.
Many Kings have been long-lived, as was Antaxerxes Mnemon, who reigned 62.
years; Augustus Caesar 56. Q Elizabeth 44, etc. but died at length, to the
great grief of their subjects and servants, who are ready to with (as once the
Romans did concerning Augustus) that eithet they had never been, or never dyed.
But God is the King immortal, invisible, etc.

The Heathen are perished out of his Land] the enemies, whether Jews or
Gentiles are rid out of his Church; for that is Gods Land by a specialty, his
peculiar Portion.

Verse. 17. Lord thou have heard the desire of the humble] The whole life of a
good Christian is an holy desire, says Austin. And the desires of the
Righteous shall be satisfied, Prove. 10.24. because they are framed by the Holy
Spirit, according to the will of God, Romans 8.27. and they have the mind of
Christ, 1. Cor. 2.16. who knows the mind of the Spirit, Romans 8.27. though
their desires be not uttered, v. 26.

Thou will prepare their heart] In removendis ab illo mundi negotiis, says R.
David, and by putting them into a praying frame, and so fitting them for mercy.
Where God gives a praying heart, it is sure that he will show a pitying
heart. If he prepare the heart, he will also bend his ear; like as when we
bid our Children ask us for this or that, we mean to give it them; and as when
we open a purse as wide as we can pull it, it is a sign we intend to fill it
top-full.

Thou will cause thine ear to hear] even whilst they are preparing, and before
they can speak many times, Isa. 65.24. or whilst they are praying, as Dan.
9.20. Act. 4.31. or not long after; they shall be sure to have out their
prayers, either in money, or in monies-worth, as they say.

Verse. 18. To judge the fatherless, etc.] the Vulgar has it, to judge for the
fatherless, and for the oppressed. It is one thing (says Austin) to judge the
fatherless, and another thing to judge for him; this later is, to pass sentence
on his side; which God the righteous Judge will be sure to do without writhing
or warping; for he has all that is required of a Judge originally, and
eminently, viz. Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Constancy, and Power.

That the man of the earth may no more oppresse] or terrify, daunt with
terror, as Phil. 1.28. See the Note there. Why should one man be terrible to
another, since we are all mortales e terra, worms of the earth, clods of clay,
and shall shortly return to the dust whence we were taken? unde superbit homo?
I even I am he that comfort you; who art thou that thou should be afraid
of a man that shall die, and of the Son of man that shall be made as grass?
And forgettest the Lord thy Maker -- and have feared continually every day,
because of the fury of the Oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and
where is the fury of the Oppressor? Isa. 51.12, 13. Some observe that the close
of this Psalm is much like that of the former. How they have been taken (by the
Greek Fathers especially) for one entire Psalm, See the Note on Verse. 1.

PSALM. XI.
Verse. 1. In the Lord put I my trust] This was that which David had and held,
wherewith to answer him that reproached him (and it was an excellent good one)
that he trusted in Gods Word, Psalm. 119.42. When it was that he gave this
answer, In the Lord put I my trust (whether when Saul's courtiers, See the like
Neh. 6.10. Luke 13.31.
under pretense of friendship, counseled him to quit the Court for fear of
Saul, which he was very loath to do; or else when he was with Samuel at Naioth,
1 Samuel 19.18. etc. where his carnal friends might advise him, as Peter did his
Master, Mat. 16.22. with a Fuge, fuge, David, cito, citius, citissime) is
uncertain. But this is certain, that all the troops of ungodliness aim and act
vigorously to cast down the castle of confidence we have in God. This therefore
we must be sure to secure, as the Serpent does his Head, the Soldier his
Shield, Ephesians. 6.16. This is the victory whereby we overcome the World (with
its Allurements, or Affrightments) even our faith, 1 John 5.4. The believer
walks about as a Conqueror; and he alone is the man whom the Heathen Poet
elegantly describes, Justum and tenacem propositi virum,
Non sivium ard or prava jubentium, Horat. Carm. lib. 3. Od 7

Non vult us instantis tyranni
Mente quatit solida, etc.
Si fractus illabatur orbis,
Impavidum ferient ruinae.


The Poet instanceth in Hercules and Bacchus, but had he known of David, Moses,
Micaiah, Nehemiah, Daniel, and his three friends, etc. he would rather have
pitched upon them, or some others of those Worthies, of whom the world was not
worthy, Heb. 11.

Flee as a Bird to your mountain] Get you gone, you and your followers (the
Hebrew word Flee is plural) or flee to your mountain, O bird; see you not the
Fowlers snare? and will you not away with all speed? Thus they sought to fright
him (as Birds are fearful, Isa. 16.2. and to make him flee from his place, as a
Bird flees from her Nest, Prove. 27.8. But he was never without his Cordial,
the same that releeved him at the sack of Ziglag, where, in the fail of all
other comforts, he encouraged himself in the Lord his God, 1 Samuel 30.6. he knew
that as birds flying, so will the Lord of Hosts defend his people; defending
also, he will deliver them, and passing over he will preserve them, Isa. 31.5.
This, though it were not written in David's days, yet he had the good assurance
of it in his soul.

Verse. 2. For lo, the wicked bend their bow] scil. to shoot at you a silly
Bird; you were best therefore to be packing, Nam ecce inquitis impii
apposuerunt pedem arcui. Beza.
and not to stay till you come tumbling down, as a Bird fetched off with a bolt.
This has ever been the guise of the Churches enemies, and is still, to
terrify her (if they could) and affright her out of her faith, and true
religion. Nebuchadnezzar for instance, Antiochus that little Antichrist, the
primitive Persecutors, and still the Papists with their cruel Inquisition, and
otherwise. But what says the Apostle, In nothing be terrified by your
adversaries, Phil. 1.28. Be not afraid with any amazement, 1 Pet. 3.6. Nos
quidem neque expavescimus neque pertimescimus ea quae ab ignorantibus patimur,
Ad Scapulam,
says Tertullian; We fear not what any of you can do to us, do your worst.
Contemptus est a me Romanin and favor and furor, said Luther, I care not for
Romes frowns, or fair hooks. This the blind World counts, and calls
silliness, or stubbornness, but they know not the force of faith, nor the
privy armor of proof, that the Saints have about their hearts. They make
ready their Arrow upon the string (not in the quiver as the Vulgar reads it.)

That they may privily shoot] Heb. to shoot in the darkness: so that although
the Saints hide themselves in Caves, and dark corners, yet they are ferreted
out thence by their Persecutors, as David was by Saul often. And this some hold
to be the meaning of that place, Psalm. 74.20. The dark places of the earth are
full of the habitations of cruelty; that is, we can hideour selves no where,
but the Persecutors find us out.

Verse. 3. If the foundations be destroyed] If all things be turned topsie
turvie in the State, and no regard had to right or wrong, Sed vi geritur res,
ut in regno Cyclopico; If Saul, not withstanding mine alliance to him, and
innocence toward him, his many fair promises to me, and those hazards and
hardships I have suffered for his sake, will needs go on to hunt me up and
down, as a Partridge in the mountains, and to seek mine utter undoing, what can
I do to help it? how can it be but the most righteous must have his share of
sufferings? See Psalm. 82.5.

What can the righteous do?] More than glorify God, by suffering his Will,
and patiently wait for better times, comforting himself (as in the next verse)
in this confidence, that God is in Heaven, etc. Some render it, What has the
righteous done? The wicked will say, that he has undone all, and that David
with his accomplices are the causes of all the public calamities and confusions.
So the Primitive Persecutors charged the Christians, and Papists do still the
Protestants, Christianos ad leones. Tertul.
to be the troublers of the State, the Seeds-men of sedition, the disturbers of
the Churches peace, etc. when as indeed themselves are flagella Reip. flabella
seditionis, the only traitors and troublers of Israel; with Athaliah they cry
out Treason, Treason, when themselves are the greatest Traitors and
Incendiaries of Christendom. We may confidently say with the Psalmist, The
foundations are destroyed, but what has the righteous done? Some render the
words thus, But those purposes or counsels (of Saul and his flatterers, verse.
2.) shall be destroyed. (Saul shall be frustrated of his hope, therefore I will
not flee into the mountains) But what has the righteous done? That is, I have
done nothing unrighteously against Saul, therefore I will not fly, etc.

Verse. 4. The Lord is in his holy Temple] i. e. in Heaven, and there-hence he
both can and will do much for the releef of his poor oppressed, Ubi deficit
auxilium humanum incip^^ divinum. Philo.
though the righteous can do little for themselves: he also knows, and will
clear their innocence; for he sits between the Cherubims, whence he is wont to
send help, Psalm. 20.3. and has his Throne in Heaven, whence he is wont to
strike terror into the enemies, Psalm. 18.8, etc.

The Lords Throne is in Heaven] This is the same with the former, serving to
set forth Gods Sufficiency, as the following words do his Efficiency, Dei
solium est nostrum asylum.
those props of David's faith, answerable to Jachin and Boaz, those two brazen
Pillars in Salomons Temple.

His eyes behold, his eyelids try the children of men] The eye of God is taken
in Scripture (says one) either for his knowledge, or for his judgment; his
eye in this Text points out his knowledge, his eyelids his critical descant.
It is a manner of speech, says another, taken from those men's actions who
being desirous to look upon a thing more intently do wink with their eyes, or
close up one of them, that they may see the better with the other.

Verse. 5. The Lord tries the righteous] or approves, as Jam. 1.12, he
justifies and accepts him as appears by the opposition here. The vulgar
renders it thus; Deus interrogat justum and impium, sc. quiae per
interrogatoria veritas dignose^tur. The Lord interrogateth the just and the
wicked scil. that so he may sift out the truth of things. But neither does the
Hebrew word so signify, nor does God need any such help.

His soul hateth] i.e. he can in no wise away with; and this is spoken of God
after the manner of men, for fury, hatred, and the like affections are not in
him. If it could be said of Trajan the Emperor, that he neither feared nor
hated any man, how much more of God? And if of the Tribunal at Zant, much
better of Gods Throne.

Hic locus odit, amat, punit, conservat, honorat,
Nequitiam, pacem, crimina, jura, bonos.
Verse. 6. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares] His soul hates them; and, as
revenge is the next effect of hatred, he will exercise horrible Judgments upon
them. Go on they may in their wicked ways for a time, and happily think to
outrun Wrath, but it shall easily overtake them, and inevitably; for the first
thing that God shall rain upon them is Snares, to catch and hold them fast,
that they may surely suffer the rest that follow. Take him, and lead him away
safely, says Judas concerning Jesus to the Soldiers. Mark 14.44. And the same
in effect says God to his Judgments concerning the wicked, on whom for that
purpose he raineth Snares, i.e. he suddenly surpriseth them: as by unexpected
foul weather.

Fire and Brimstone] Hell from Heaven, as once upon Sodom and her Sisters,
figuring the vengeance of eternal fire. Jude 7. Rev. 20.10. Perdic se^ (...)
disperdit. etc cruciat ita ut nunquam perimar. Camero.
where the Sacrifice is salted with fire, Mark 9.49. that is, burns, but
consumes not, Fire being of a burning, but Salt of a preserving nature. Tophet
is of a most tormenting temper, the fuel thereof is fire and much wood: the
breath of the Lord like a stream of fire does kindle it, Isa. 30.33. Utinam
ubique de Gehenna differeretur, says a Father; O that men would think, and
talk much of Hell! O that they would take a turn in it; and taking a view of
that formidable fire fed with a river of Brimstone, and blown by the breath of
the Almighty, they would hasten out of their Natural condition, as Lot did out
of Sodom; since there is the smell of the fire and brimstone already upon them!

And an horrible tempest] Ventus procellosissimus, a most terrible blasting
Whirlwind, such as the Greeks call Prester; whereof see Plin. Lib. 2. c. 48.
and the Evangelist calls Euroclydon, Act. 27.14. The mariners mischief.

This shall be the portion of their cup] Vel, portio part is eorum, id est,
ipsissima eorum portio; duplicatur idem sensus duobus verbis, says R. David.
He seems to allude to the custom at Feasts, where each had his Cup, his
demensum, or measure of meat and drink. Wicked ones shall drink up the cup of
Gods Wrath (worse than that cup of boiling Lead powered down the drunken Turks
throat by the command of the Bashaw) though it be brim-full, and have eternity
to the bottom, Psalm. 75.8.

Verse. 7. For the righteous Lord loves righteousness] Sc. as a reflection of
himself, as a piece of his own image. This is better than eyes opened, limbs
restored, Psalm. 146.8.

His countenance] Heb. Countenances, or their faces, in mystery of the Holy
Trinity.

Does behold the upright] With singular delight and complacency. Vide Vicars in
Loc.


PSALM. XII.
Verse. 1. Help Lord] 'Twas high time to call to Heaven for help, when Saul
cried, Go kill me up the Priests of Jehovah (the occasion as it is thought of
making this Psalm) and therein committed the Sin against the Holy Ghost, as
some grave Divines are of opinion, 1 Samuel 22.17 David after many sad thoughts
about that slaughter, and the occasion of it, Doegs malicious information;
together with the paucity of his fast Friends, and the multitude of his sworn
Enemies at Court, breaks forth abruptly into these words, Help Lord, help at a
dead lift. The Arabic version has it, Deliver me by main force, as with
Weapons of War, for the Lord is a Man of War, Exodus 15.3.

For the godly man ceaseth] Heb. The merciful man, who having obtained mercy
from thee, would show me mercy, and defend mine innocence; such as these are
banished the Court, which is now possessed by Parasites and Sycophants.

For the faithful fail] Veraces, the true and trusty ones, such as a man may
safely confide in; these are rare Birds. See Mic. 7.1, 2, 3, etc. with the
Notes there, When the Son of Man comes, shall be find faith (in this sense
also) in the earth? Luke 18. Hard and scarce. When Varus was slain Augustus
complained that now he had none left, that would deal plainly and faithfully
with him; Lewis the Eleventh of France would say, that he had plenty of all
things but of one. And being asked of what? Of Truth, quoth he. Aurelian the
Emperor was bought and sold by his Counselors, for he might know nothing,
but as they informed him. David complains of Saul, that he was too too apt to
hearken to every claw-back tell-tale, 1 Samuel 24.9. and 26.19. so that he could
have no fair dealing.

Verse. 2. They speak vanity every one with his neighbour] They speak falsely and
fraudulently, and therein have an Art, as Jer. 9.4, 5. such as the Devil has
taught them.

With flattering lips] Blandientibus, vel dividentibus. The Syriack version
has it, with dividing lips, such as separate very friends.

With a double heart do they speak] Heb. With an heart and a heart. So Horace
says of Ulysses.

Cursus duplicis per mare Ulyssei. The Prophet here means that they had one
heart in their body, and another in their mouth, Od. 6. Animus versutulus (...)
versatilis.
being desperate dissemblers, such as the French are said to be. Those men of
Zebulon were none such, 1 Chro. 12.33.

Verse. 3. The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips] as a rotten member is cut
off from the body -- Ne pars sincera trahatur; or as a barren tree is stocked
up, that it cumber not the ground. There is a wonderful sympathy between
Princes and Parasites, whose song is, Mihiplacet, quicquid Regi placet; and
whose practice is to speak suavia potius quam sana, sweet, rather than sound
things. But God will cut off such lips (taking notice of the offending member)
as he dealt by Doeg, Ahitophel, Shebna, Shemaiah the Nehelamite, Jer. 29.32.
Hen. Steph. (...) pol^pro Mero
and as it were to be wished that Christian Princes would do, serving them all
as the Thessalians did that City in Greece called (...), or flattery, which
they destroyed and pulled down to the ground.

And the Tongue that speaks proud things] Magnifica, bubbles of words,
blustering speeches, breathing out nothing but arrogance, and contempt of God
and his people. These grandilsqui must one day answer for their hard speeches
with flames about their ears, whatever they meet with in the mean while, as did
Nestorius, Tho. Arundel, Stephen Gardener, and others, plagued here in their
tongues, those little Members that had boasted sogreat things, Jam. 3.

Verse. 4. Who have said, with our tongues will we prevail) Dictitant enim,
this was a common word with them; And surely the tongue is a desperate weapon,
made in the form a flaming sword, and elsewhere by David compared to a Tuck or
Rapier, Psalm. 42. to a rasor also doing deceit, Psalm. 52. The Chalde Paraphrast
has this Text thus, Because we can swear and lie, therefore we shall prevail.

Our lips are our own] Heb. are with us, that is, we have the command of our
tongues, and have words at will; we can speak perswasively, and therefore we
doubt not to persuade Saul to any thing against David. Socrates in his Apology,
My Lords said he to the Judges; I know not how you have been affected with mine
adversaries eloquence, while you heard them speak; for mine own part, I assure
you, that I, whom it touches most, was almost drawn to believe that all they
said, though against my self, was true; when they scarcely uttered one word of
truth. Caim Curio the Roman was ingeniose nequam, wittily wicked; Patercul^^^
and the Duke of Backingham in his speech to the Londoners, for Rich. 3. gained
this (though slender) commendation, that no man could deliver so much bad
matter in so good words, and quaint phrases.

Who is Lord over us?] sc. to hinder us from speaking what and when we list
with finenesse and eloquence; though to the slaying of three at once, the
talebearer, the tale-hearer, and the party traduced. R. Samuel Ben. Jochai
has this note upon the Text; A slanderous tongue is called Lashon Tabithat,
because it slays three; Lingus (...)
but here it slew four, viz. Doeg, Saul, Nob the City of the Priests, and
Abner, who suffered it so to be, 1. Sam. 22.

Verse. 5. For the oppression of the poor] whose very oppression (though they
complain not) has a voice and God will hear it, for he is gracious, Exodus
22.27. He heard Hagars affliction, though she said nothing, Genesis 16.11. he
hears the young Ravens that cry unto him by implication only.

For the sighing of the needy] If it be but their breathing, Lens. 3.56. God
can feel it, but the sighs of his people are effectual orators, Exodus 2.23,
24, 25. and 3.7. and their tears he puts in a bottle, Psalm. 56.9.

Now will I arise] sc. in the nick of time, when all seems to be lost. Man's
extremity is Gods opportunity. Cum duplicarenter lateres, venit Moses, see Isa.
33.10. Now, Now, Now.

Says the Lord] Dixit mihi per Prophetiam, Isa. 22.14.

From him that puffs at him] That defyeth him, and thinks he can blow him
away at a blast; but if God arise only, his enemies shall be scattered; R.
David.
as Thistledown is by a puff of wind, Psa. 68.1. Some render the Text, He will
puff at him, that is, the oppressed will now dare to speak freely, who before
durst not mute.

Verse. 6. The words of the Lord are pure words] free from all insincerity or
falsehood; and not like those of Saul's flatterers, vile and vicious. All Gods
promises are infallible, and such as a man may write upon, as they say; They
are yea and Amen, 2 Cor. 1.20. that is, Truth and assurance. God has hitherto
kept promise with nights and days, that they shall one succeed another, Jerem.
33.20, 25. therefore much more will he keep promise with his people.

As silver tried in a Furnace] In a sublimatory or crucible. The Greeks call it
(...) St. Peter's word, ^ Ep. 1.7.

Purified seven times] that is, sufficiently. Alchimie-gold as it will not
pass the seventh fire, so it does not comfort the heart, as true gold will.

Verse. 7. Thou shall keep them] that is, Verba praedicta, the forementioned
words or promises, says Aben-Ezra. Or, keep thou them (prayerwise,) and so
David puts Gods promises in suit. A certain good man having all taken from him,
and his Wife desiring to know how he and his Family should live? He answered,
he would now put his Bond in suit; that is, he would urge God with his
Promises.

Thou shall preserve them] Heb. Him, that is, every one of them, viz. the poor
and needy, amongst whom David reckons himself, which shows his humility.

From this Generation] So they are called for their multitude, in opposition to
those few faithful ones, verse. 1. An evil and adulterous Generation they were,
a Bastardly brood, as Mat. 12.39. Omne tempus feret Clodios, Catones non omne
feret, says Seneca.

Verse. 8. The wicked walk on every side] In circuitu, says the Vulgar; the
circular Motion is most subtle, the Devil walks the round to do mischief; but
better render it circumquaque on every side, to show their numbers and their
insolences; all places are full of them, such dust-heaps are found in every
corner; when as the godly are as the salt of the earth, sprinkled here and
there (as Salt uses to be) to keep the rest from putrefying.

When the vilest men are exalted] Heb. Vilities, the abstract for the concrete,
quisquiliae, (...). Often, empty Vessels swim aloft, rotten Posts are gilt with
adulterate Gold, the worst weeds spring up bravest. Chaff will get to the top
of the Fan; when good Corn, as it lies at the bottom of the heap, so it falls
low at the feet of the Fanner. The reason why wicked men walk on every side,
are so brisk, so busy, and who but they? is given in to be this, because
Losels and Rioters were exalted. See Prove. 28.12.18. and 29.2. As Rhewms and
Catarrhes fall from the Head to the Lungs, and cause a Consumption of the whole
body; so it is in the Body Politic. As a Fish putrifies first in the head, and
then in all the parts: So here. Some render the Text thus, When they (that is
the wicked) are exalted, it is a shame for the Sons of men, that other men, who
better deserve preferment, are not only slighted, but vilely handled by such
worthless Ambitionists; who yet the higher they climb, as Apes, the more they
discover their deformities.

PSALM. XIII.
Verse. 1. How long will thou forget me, O Lord, for ever?] It appears that
when David penned this Psalm (which some think was about the end of Saul's
Persecution, when he was forced to fly into the Land of the Philistines, 1 Samuel
27.1.) he was under a dreadful desertion, and that for a long while together;
Hence his many How-longs, and for ever? Christ (says Greenham) was forsaken
for a few hours, David for a few months, and Job for a few years. Luther
confesses of himself, that after his conversion he lay three days in
desperation; and the like is reported of Mr. Robert Bol^on, who felt himself
for the time in the Suburbs of Hell, as it were. So did Heman, Psalm. 88.5. so
did David here, and elsewhere. The final absence of God is Hell it self; Depart
from me ye cursed, is worse than into everlasting fire. To be punished from
the presence of the Lord is the Hell of Hells, 2 Thessalonians. 1.9. God seems to
forget his dearest Children sometimes for a season, to the end that they may
remember themselves, and become every way better; as the Lion leaves her Whelps
till they have almost killed themselves with roaring, that they may become the
more courageous. But to speak properly, God cannot forget his people, Isa.
44.16. and 49.14, 15, 16. Non deserit Deus, etiamsi deserere videatur; non
deserit etiamsi deserat, says Austin: If he leave us for a time, yet he
forsakes us not at all. If he hide his face (as in the next words) which is a
further trial, and a greater misery (for it imports indignation, contempt,
and hatred) yet it is but for a moment, though it should be during life; and he
therefore takes liberty to do it, says one, because he has an eternity of
time, to reveal his kindness in; time enough for kisses and embraces; mean
while, as when the Sun is ecclipsed, though the earth wants the light thereof,
yet not the influence thereof; so Gods supporting Grace is ever with his
deserted.

Verse. 2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul?] i.e. conceal my grief,
says Aben-Ezra, which is no small aggravation of it; or, how long shall I toss
and tumble in my mind, sundry counsels, and purposes, but allto no purpose?
This is no small affliction, when we try all courses to get out of durance, and
nothing will do. Such must needs have much sorrow in their hearts.

Having sorrow in my heart daily] Heb. by day, sc. when others are full of
business and forget their sorrows, says R. David. But the Greek renders it,
day and night. David was a cheerful man, and a great Musician; but at this
time heaviness had possessed his heart, and his harp would not relieve him.
Sadness of Spirit had dried up his bones, Prove. 17.22. and made him a very bag
of bones, a bottle in the smoke shrinking away to nothing almost. See Prove.
12.25. and 15.13. and the Notes.

Verse. 3. Consider and hear me O Lord my God] He turns him to God in this
peck of troubles (for they seldom come single) and pleads the Covenant, My
God; beseeching him to see and hear both at once, how it fared with him, and to
send him feasonable and suitable succor. It were wide with the faithful, if
they had not their God to repair unto in distress, pouring out their souls
into his blessed bosom. This they must do most earnestly, when under a cloud
of desertion; as our Savior being in an agony prayed more fervently, Luke
22.44. and as Micah having lost his Gods, set up his Note, Judge. 18.

Lighten mine eyes lest I sleep death] i. e. Comfort my conscience, clear up my
condition, and cheer up my drooping spirit, lest I faint away as a dying man,
whose eyes through weakness wax dim; lest I fall into that somnus ferreus,
as the Poets call death, that longest sleep; Surge, ne longus tibi somnus unde
Non times, detur. Mor.lib.3.^ 11.



Verse. 4. Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him] This David
frequently deprecateth, as a great evil, because Gods honor was concerned in
it, and would suffer by it. As unskilful hunters shooting at wild Beasts, do
sometimes kill a man; so Persecutors shooting at Saints, hit Christ, reproach
him; and this the Saints are very sensible of.

And those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved] Compose Comedies out of my
Tragedies, and iram Dei ad calumniam rapiant. The wicked are vindictive and
implacable, sick of the Devils disease (...), rejoicing at other men's harms,
revelling in other men's ruins; But this is to inrage God, and hasten wrath,
Prove. 24.17, 18.

Verse. 5. But I have trusted in thy mercy] Notwithstanding all the endeavors
of Earth and of Hell to cast down this castle of my confidence, I will not quit
it; but be still as a green Olive tree in the house of God; I Will trust in the
mercy of God for ever and ever, Psalm. 52.8.

Verse. 6. I will sing unto the Lord] How far different is the end of this
Psalm, from the beginning? See the like, Psalm 6.1. with the Note there.

Because he has dealt bountifully with mee] Qui retribuit mihi, so Popish
meritmongers read it, and would there-hence collect something in favor of
their absurd Tenent, But their own Vulgar Translation has it, bona tribuit,
Aynsworth
has givenmee good things; And it is well observed, that though the Hebrew
word be sometimes taken for rewarding evil for good, Psalm. 7.5. or evil for
evil, Psalm. 137.8. yet from God to his people it commonly signifies a
bountiful rewarding of good things instead of evil, which we rather do
deserve, So Psalm. 116.7. and 110.17. and 142.8.

PSALM. XIV.
Verse. 1. The fool] That saplesse fellow, that carcass of a man, Nabal, a foo^
or a churl. Nebalah a (...) kass, Levit. 1^.40.
that walking sepulcher of himself, in whom all Religion and right Reason is
withered and wasted, dried up and decayed. That Apostate, in whom natural
Principles are extinct, and from whom God is departed; as when the Prince is
removing, hangings are taken down. That mere Animal that has no more than
areasonable soul, and for little other purpose than as salt, to keep his body
from putrefying. That wicked man hereafter described, (...) 1 Cor. 2.14.
that studieth Atheism,

Has said in his heart] As David proves afterward by his practice; for there
are practical Atheists as well as Dogmaticall. See a like passage, Psalm. 36.1.
the transgression of the Wicked says, within my heart (that is, my mind gives
me, and I am strongly persuaded) that there as no fear of God before his eyes.
This is the charge; but what proof is there? proof good enough, verse. 2, 3, 4.
For he flattereth himself, etc. So here; He is a flat Atheist; for corrupt
he is, and become abominable, etc. That which Cicero says of Epicurus, that
lest he should offend the Athenians, verbis reliquit deos, re sustulit, De
not. Deor.
in words he affirmed there were Gods, but in deed he denied a deity, is
found true in many even at this day; for all places are full of them, and so is
Hell too. Lucian is their old Testament, and Machiavell their New. Worse they
are than Agrippa, who was almost a Christian; worse than Protagoras with his De
diis utrum sint, non ansim affirmare. For in their hearts and lives there is
heard this hellish language,

There is no God] Oh horrible! Not that Atheism can ever find a perfect and
continual assent in man's heart: For there is no Nation under Heaven so
barbarous, but yields that there is a God. When man fell from God, this Truth
stood; as when Cities and great buildings are overthrown by war, some Towers,
some Pinnacles survive the violence. They lie, says Seneca, whosay that they
hold there is no God; Theat. Hist. 127.
for though to thee they say so by day, yet to themselves and by night they
doubt of it, at least. And when they come to dye, they sometimes cry out they
are damned; as did Thomas Blaverus chief Counselor sometimes to the King of
Scots; and one Arthur Miller a professed Atheist, and before them both, a certain
desperate Dean of Paul's. Sword against Swearer^ Pa. ^4.


Corrupt are they and become abominable] Or loathsome; how should they be
better, that have laid hands upon all the principles in their heads, and made a
clean riddancst of them; that they may run riot in sin without restraint or
control? which while others see, they also are ready to say with that Poet,
Solicitor nullos esse putare Deos.

I have read of a Woman who living in professed doubt of the Godhead, after
better illumination and repentance, Mr. Wards Hap. of Par^^
did often protest, that the vicious life of a great Scholar in that Town did
conjure up those damnable doubtings in her soul.

There is none that does good] i. e. None to speak of, no considerable number,
Apparent rarinantes in gurgite vasto.

Verse. 2. Virgil. Ae^eid.
The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the Children of men] As opposed to the
Children of God; so some take it, as Genesis 4 26. and 6.2. As a Judge he looks
down, he vieweth, he takes cognizance, ere he proceeds to sentence: Thus he
dealt with the old World, with Sodom, with Egypt, etc. to teach us not to be
over hasty. No more have than good speed, says one. The caelestiall Spheres,
the higher they are in situation, the flower in their proper motion; and the
supreme Judge of all uses much forbearance.

Any that did understand and seek God] These only are they, whom God looks
after; not the rich, but the righteous. And because Knowledge is the ground of
all goodness, as folly is of wickedness, verse. 1. therefore is it here said,
any that did understand and seek God. Lo these are those precious ones whom
God regards; such as are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, Romans
15.14. The Father seeks such to worship him, Joh. 4.23.

Verse. 3. They are all gone aside, etc.] This is Gods own report of the matter,
fully answering to that before given in by David, verse. 1. Good men have the
mind of Christ, 1 Cor. 2.16. and do fully concur with him in Judgment and
affection. David was a man after Gods own heart, and the heart of Paul is the
heart of Christ, says Chrysostom. But why then does not David except himself
out of this universitas declinantinus, community of straglers that are gone
aside? and why does St. Paul argue from this Text, that all, both Jews and
Gentiles, are stark naught^ Romans 3.10, 11, 12. I answer, because by nature
there is never a better of us: but (...), as the Greek Proverb has it. All we
like sheep have gone astray, says the whole Church, Isa. 53. Home est inversus
decalogus, we naturally all stand acrols to all goodness. The word here rendered
gone aside, signifies to give back sturdily, as a stubborn Heifer, that
refuses to receive the yoke.

They are altogether become filthy] Heb. stinking, yielding a worse smell than
Carrion does, or than the filthy Fox does, of whom Oppianus reports (and
experience shows it to be true) that when he is beset on all sides by the
Dogs that hunt him, he bewrays his tail with urine, and dung, of a most
loathsome smell, Bodin. ^ Not. 352.
and besmearing therewith the Dogs Noses, drives them away therewith many
times. But all this is nothing to the filth and stench of sin, which made their
very Incense an abomination, Isa. 1.13. and renders them most like the Devil,
that foul Spirit, that ever goes out with a stench, as they say of him. The
Hebrews have the same word for sin, (...)
and a dead Carcass; and again, the same word for sin, and stench. Gods
Vineyard brought forth stinking Grapes, Isa. 5. and the wicked utter rotten
Language, Ephesians. 4. Hence Longinquus est Jehovah ab impiis, The Lord stands
aloof off from the wicked, Prove. 15.29. Psalm. 5.5. that is, from all for whom
Christ has not given himself an Offering, and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet
smelling savor, Ephesians. 5.2. The Apostle renders it, They are useless: or, as
he elsewhere phraseth it, to every good work reprobate, Tit. 1. ult.

There is none that does good] Spiritually good, andunto divine acceptance.
There is many times Malum opus in bona materia. How can you that are evil do
good works? Good they may be materially, but not formally and eventually; such
were the good parts and practices of Socrates, Aristides, Scipio, Atticus,
Cato, and other honest Heathens; they were no better than splendida peccata,
glistering sins, because they failed,

1 Quoad fontem, they did not out of the good treasure of their hearts bring
forth those good things: they were strangers to the Life of God, to the new
Nature.

2 Quoad finem, they brought forth fruit to themselves, Hof. 10.1. they had not
good aims in their good actions. Now, Bonum non fit nisi ex integra causa;
malum ex quolibet defectu, say the Schools.

No not one] Vsque ad unum. i. c. ad Christum, says Austin, not considering
the force of the Hebrew phrase, which imports an utter denial of any mere
man, that of himself does good.

Verse. 4. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?] No, not so much as
Pilates Wife had in a Dream; for else they would take heed of having any thing
to do with those justmen. But they are workers of iniquity, habituated and
hardened in cruelty, fleshed in blood; and having an hoof upon their hearts, so
that they are Masters of their Consciences, and have taken a course with them.
In this question here asked, the Psalmist does not so much quaerere, as queri,
ask, as chide, and complain.

Who eat up my people as they eat bread] That is, quotid'e, daily, says
Austin; as duly as they eat bread; or, with the same eagerness and voracity.
These mancaters, these (...), cruel Cannibals, make no more conscience to undo
a poor man, than to eat a good meal when they are hungty. Like Pickerels in a
Pond, or Sharks in the Sea, they devour the poorer, as those do the lesser
Fishes; and that many times with a plausible invisible consumption; as the
Usurer, who like the Ostrich can digest any metal; but especially money.

They call not upon the Lord] viz. for a blessing upon that their bread, as
some sense it; how should they, since God abhors them? Psalm. 10.3. But better
take it for neglect of the duty of Prayer; they rob God of his inward and
outward Worship, and so deal worse with him than Idolaters do with their
Dunghildeities, whom they cease not to call upon. These will commit no Solecism
in Gods Service; and be sure that their prayer (like that of Hamaus, Esth.
7.7.) shall never be turned into sin. If they pray in extremity (as then a
Joah will lay hold on the Horns of the Altar) it is but as blind Beggars are
forced to ask, though they know not of whom.

Verse. 5. There were they in great fear ^ There? and they? and in great fear?
where? and who? and what kind of fear was it they were in? For answer; There,
that is, in the generation of the righteous, in the assemblies of the Saints,
according to that, Psalm. 76.3. There brake he the arrows of the Bow, the
Shield, and the Sword, and the Battle. Selah. There, that is, in Salem, where
is Gods Tabernacle; and in Sion, where is his dwelling place, verse. 2. in the
Congregation where the Saints were praying. Or, There, that is, in the very
place where they oppressed and devoured the poor, they were surprised with a
sudden horror; even there where they had said, In locoubi opprimu^^, R. David.
peace and safety etc. and where no fear was, Psalm. 53.5. no apparent cause of
such an amazement, Isa. 13.8. A panick terror fell upon them; they feared a
fear, as the Hebrew has it, but could not tell why: The Hornet within stings
them, and they have many a secret twinge that the World is never aware of. Saul
was afraid of David, and Catiline trembled upon the least noise made.

For God is in the generation of the righteous] And natural Conscience cannot
but do homage to the Image of God, stamped upon the natures and works of the
godly. See it in the carriage of Nebuchadnezzar and Darius toward Daniel,
sticking stoutly to his Principles. The piety, patience, mercy, goodness,
expressed by the righteous when oppressed, makes the hearts of wicked men ache
within them; and they are sore afraid of the Name of God called upon by them,
Deuteronomy. 38.10. Or, God is in the generation of the righteous, scil. Ad juvandum
eum, says Aben-Ezra, to support and succor them; and that strangely many
times, the enemies themselves being Judges, to their great astonishment.

Verse. 6. You have shamed the counsel of the poor] And thought to mock him out
of his confidence, as Sennacherib did by Hezekiah, and the Jews by our Savior.
Religion was long since grown, as it is also at this day among many, not more a
matter of form, than of scorn. In our wretched days, as the Turks count all
fools to be Saints, so many with us account all Saints to be fools. He is a
fool, we say, that would be laughed out of his Coat; but he were a double fool
that would be laughed out of his skin, that would hazard his Soul, because
loath to be laughed at.

Because the Lord is his refuge] Sed Jehovah Protector ejus, because he runs to
God by prayer, and commits himself wholly to him for direction and success in
all his enterprises; Pudefacitis, id est, facitis ut videatur putidum,
you'jeer, and hold it an egregious silliness. You reject his confidence, and
rely on the arm of flesh; which yet was never true to those that trusted unto
it.

Verse. 7. O that the Salvation of Israel, etc.] This is the second part of the
Psalm, wherein David prays to God to deliver his Israel out of the hands of
those Atheists, and Oppressors. The whole Church must be remembered in our
prayers, Sanhed. c. 11.
and that ancient people of God the Jews not forgotten. Many of their Rabbis
make this whole Psalm a Prophecy of their dispersion among the Genitles their
Oppressors; and this, a prayer for their restoration. For our sins, say they,
which are many, the coming of the Messiah (that Salvation of Israel) is
deferred; the time of his coming is sealed up, Dan. 12.4. Verum enimvero Deus
nos dignabitur clarissima visione cum reducet Zionem; tunc intelligemus res
ipsas prout sunt, says Jachiades on that Text: but God shall give us a clear
sight of all things, when he shall bring back Zion, etc. This is truth, and we
must hasten that time by our heartiest wishes for that obdurate people, that a
Redeemer would come to them out of Zion. Romans 11.26. that the covering cast
over that people might be destroyed, Isa. 25.7. and a general joy conceived
throughout all the Churches for their happy readmission.

Out of Zion] i.e. Out of the Church, whence all good comes; and such
blessings as are better than all else that Heaven or Earth affords, Psalm.
134.3.

PSALM. XV.
Verse. 1. Lord, who shall abide in thy Tabernacle?] Heb. who shall sojourn? for
that is our condition whiles here, in a foreign Country, and not at home. The
Church Militant also is Transportative, as well as the Tabernacle; and not
fixed to one place. Never was the Ark settled, till set in Solomon's Temple;
neither shall we till we come to Heaven. David having described an Atheist in
Psalm. 14. and finding but too many such in the bosom of the Church,
Politicians, profane Persons, Hipocrites, who profess that they know God, but
in works they deny him, Tit. 1.16. (He that dethroneth a King, does as bad as
he that denies him) He therefore beggs of God to disterminate, and put a
difference between the righteous and the wicked, by certain infallible
distinctive Notes and Characters, wherein men may surely rest, without danger
of being deceived; since his testimony is beyond all exception, and he is (...)
Self-credible. Here then that grand and grave Question is propounded by David
as a Prophet of God, consulting with him, and answered by God himself, for more
authority sake; who is the true Citizen of Zion, the free Denizon of the New
Jerusalem, who is a right member of the Church Militant, and shall be at length
of the Church Triumphant? A reverend Divine said once to a poor Soul, that told
him he was troubled about his Salvation, I tell thee, said he, it is able to
trouble the whole World. Sinners sal^ by Hooker, page 2.
Let a man but approve himself the party here described, in desire at least,
and endeavor, being humbled for his daily failings, and he may be confident.

Who shall dwell in thine holy hill?] Heaven is aptly compared to a Hill, Hell
to a Hole. Now who shall ascend into this holy Mount? None but those whom this
Mount comes down unto, that have sweet communion with God in this life present,
whose conversation is in Heaven, though their commoration be for a while upon
earth, who do here cate and drink, and sleep eternal life.

Verse. 2. He that walks uprightly] This is Gods answer, for men are unsound,
and unfit to judge, says Calvin. They judge according to opinion, and
appearance many times, and send those to Heaven that can never come there; as
the Pope does his Canonized Saints; Mahomet those that dye in defense of
Turcisme; and Parasitical Preachers, their irreligious benefactors. But God
only admits such as are righteously religious, and religiously righteous;
such, as through whose whole lives godliness runs, as the Woof does through
the Warp. He then that shall be an inhabitant of Heaven, must first walk
uprightly, or evenly. Christians, says Tertullian, are funambulones, as those
that walk on ropes, if they tread but one step awry they are utterly gone; they
must be Sine terrena and profunda fraud (as R. David here glosseth) without
guile, and unacquainted with the depths of the Devil. Prove. 11.22. the upright
in their way are opposed to the froward in heart. And such only shall dwell
with devouring fire, that is, with God, Isa. 33.14, 15. The Arabic version for
uprightly here, has, without a cloud of vices.

And works righteousness] This is wrought by faith, Heb. 11.33. and such a
man is acceptable to God, Act. 10.35. But the whole life of unbeleevers is sin,
says Austin, neither is there any thing good, without the chiefest good. It
was well said of Luther, Walk in the heaven of the Promise, but in the earth of
the Law; that in respect of believing, this of obeying.

And speaks the truth in his heart] His (...) are all one, he speaks as he
thinks; his speech is the lively image of his inward affection. That was no
commendation to that Pope and his Nephew, of whom it was said, that the one
never spoke as he thought, the other never performed what he spoke.

Verse. 3. He that backbiteth not with his tongue] that trotteth not up and
down for the purpose, as the word signifies; Ragal, when Regal a foo^ Ruchil.
that walks not about as a Pedlar with his pack, as the word is Levit. 19.16.
this is a bloody sin, ibid. confer, Ezekiel. 22.9. Many ways a man may backbite
with his tongue, that unruly member.

Imponens, augens, manifestans, in mala v^rtens,
Qui negat, aut minuit, tacuit, laudatque remiss.
One observes from this Text, that there is also a slander of the heart, that
never comes into the tongue, sc. hard conceits, and evil surmises. Some say,
that the word here signifies to speak truth, but with a mischievons mind, to
hurt another; as Doeg dealt by David, and is therefore accursed, Psalm. 52. and
called a liar for his labor, Psalm. 120. The smutting of another man's good-name
in any kind behind his back, is backbiting; it is an irreparable wrong; take
heed of it. The eye, and the good-name can bear no jests, as the Proverb has
it.

Nor dath evil to his Neighbour] Neither by disparaging, nor disprofiting him.
There is an elegancy in the original, that cannot be Englished.

Nor takes up a reproach against his Neighbour] Or receives, Or indureth. The
talebearer carries the Devil in his tongue; the tale-hearer in his ear.
Plautus wishes that the one may be hanged by his tongue, and the other by his
ear; the receiver we say is as bad as the ^heef. Not only he that makes a
lie, but he that loves it is excluded Heaven, Rev. 22.15. It is evil to sow
reports and slanders; but worse to harrow them in. The Heathen could say, He
that easily believes slanders, aut improbis, aut puerilibus est moribus, is
either a knave, or a fool.

Verse. 4. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned] An abject, a Reprobate, as
one renders it; Josephus.
be he as high as Haman, See Esthers Character of him, chap. 7. 6. and
Mordica^'s slighting of him, chap. 3.2. Be he as great as Antiochus Epiphanes,
to whom the Samaritans excusing themselves that they were no Jews, wrote thus,
To Antiochus the great God; Daniel counted and called him a vile person, chap.
11.21. So Elisha despised Jehoram the King, 2 King. 3.14. we also must despise
the wicked; yet non virum, sed vitium, and salvo cuique loci sui honere; giving
honor, befitting their places, to whom honor is due, Romans 13. but shunning
that partiality taxed by St. James, chap. 2.3, 4. The Burgess of the new
Jerusalem, reprobes reprobat, and probos probat, he cannot flatter any man,
nor fancy such as in whom he finds not aliquid Christi, something of the
image of God. A golden Colosse stuffed with rubbish he cannot stoop to.

But he honors them that fear the Lord] As the only earthly Angels, though
never so mean, and despicable in the Worlds eye. Mr. Fox being asked whether
he remembered not such a poor servant of God, who had received succor from him
in time of trouble? answered, I remember him well; I tell you I forget Lords
and Ladies to remember such. Ingo an ancient King of Draves and Veneds set his
Pagan-Nobles (at a feast) in his Hall below, and a company of poor Christians
with himself in his presence Chamber, Aeneas Sylv. cap. 20.
entertaining them with the royallest cheer, and kingliest attendance that
might be. At which when his Nobles wondered, he told them, this he did not as he
was King of the Draves, but as he was King of another World; wherein these
should be his companions, and fellow-Princes.

He that swears to his own hurt, and changes not] Covetousness he so
hates, that first, he will rather suffer loss than be worse than his oath or
honest word; secondly, he lends, looking for nothing again; thirdly, he
takes no reward against the innocent, either as a Judge, or as a Pleader. Of
many swearers it may be said, that they can play with oaths as Children do with
Nuts; or as Monkies do with their collars, which they can slip off at their
pleasure. And of many promisers, that they are like the Peacock, all in
changable colors, as often changed as moved: But this is not the guise of Gods
people. Tertul.
The Jews at this day keep no oath, unless they swear upon their own T^rah, or
Law, brought out of their Synagogues. The Turks keep no oath further than may
stand with their own convenience; The Papists hold, that faith is not to be
kept with Heretics; and they practice accordingly. But the old Romans had a
great care always to perform their word, whatever it cost them; insomuch that
the first Temple built in Rome was dedicated to the Goddess Fidelity. In after
times indeed, Romany promittere promptumerat, promissis autem, quanquam
jurament^ firmatis, minime stare. The Romans were forward to promise and swear,
Procop. de bell. Persic. lib. 1.
but careless to perform, if Mirrhanes the Persia General may be believed.
But an oath was ever held amongst all Nations a sacred bond, and obligatory,
unless it were contra bonos mores, as the Lawyers speak. Josuah and the Elders
kept their oath to the Gibeonites, though to their inconvenience. Zedekiah was
punished for not keeping touch with the King of Babylon. And one of the laws of
the Knights of the Band in Spain was, that if any of them broke his promise,
he went alone by himself, and no body spoke to him, nor he to any.

Verse. 5. He that puts not out his money to usury] To biting usury, so some
distinguish it from Tarbith, the toothlesse usury. But both these are
condemned, Ezekiel. 18.8. 13. and no man of note in all Antiquity ( Jews and
Manichees excepted) for one thousand five hundred years after Christ, has ever
undertaken the defense thereof. Here and Neh. 5. it is plainly cried down;
neither is there any ground in Scripture for that distinction of usury into
biting and toothlesse. The Bever biteth so sore, as that he never loses his
teeth, until he have broke the bones.

Nor takes reward against the innocent] Olim didici quid sint munera, said
one. A good man as he despises the gain of oppressions, so he shakes his
hands from holding of bribes, Isa. 33.15. lest the touching thereof should
infect and benumme him; as Pliny writes of the fish Torpedo, and as Histories
report of Demosthenes that great Lawyer, tempted and prevailed with against
right, by poising Harpalus his goblet.

He that does these things] For not the hearers of the law, but the doers
shall be justified, Romans 2.13. And to them who by patient continuance in
well-doing seek for glory, and honor, and immortality, shall be eternal
life. Verse. 7.

Shall never be moved] Potest in momentum moveri, sed non in aeternum: resurget
^nim, says R. Solomon here; Moved he may be for a time, but not removed for
ever. His soul is bound up in the bundle of life, near unto the throne of
glory; when the souls of the Wicked are restless as a stone in the midst of a
sling, says the Targum in 1 Samuel 25.

PSALM. XVI.
MIchtam of David] i.e. David's precious Jewel, or Psalm of Gold, propter
mirificans ejus excellentiam, better worth than its weight in gold, Insignis O^
Davidis Tren (...) prae corona a^ stimatur hic Psalmus. R. Solomon
both for the matter thereof, and the meeter. Aureum flumen orationis, said
Cicero concerning Aristotle's Politics; there is in that Book a golden flood of
discourse; and Liber iste aur^ contra non carus, said Another, concerning the
Lives of the Philosophers written by Disgenes Laertius; No gold is comparable
to that gallant piece. How much more may the same be said of this notable
Psalm? as that which, beside many other remarkable matters, lively sets
forth the mystery of Christ his passion and resurrection, with the fruit of
both; this he does more like an Evangelist than a Prophet, and may therefore
be called (as likewise Isaiah is) the Evangelical Prophet. And whereas says
learned Beza, he calls the Messiah Chasid, verse. 10. (that is, as I
interpret it, that Man, upon whom the Father has most plentifully powered out
all his grace and bounty, which also we all draw from him alone by faith) David
seems in this one word to have summed up the whole Doctrine of the Gospel.

Verse. 1. Preserve me O God] Keep me safe unto the Kingdom both temporal
and eternal, which thou have promised me; and now that I am flying to the
Philistines for shelter, 1 Samuel 27.1. (for that is held to be the time when he
composed this golden Psalm) guard me, guide me, keep me by thy power through
faith unto salvation. This prayer of his, David was well assured should be
granted, and therefore he gives thanks, Verse. 7.

For in thee do I put my trust] This was a most powerful plea, for to trust
God is the highest honor we can do him, it is to set the Crown upon his head,
See Judge 9.15. And if such shall be forsaken, God will be a great loser in his
glory, whereof he is very tender.

Verse. 2. O my soul thou have said unto the Lord] Or I have said unto the Lord;
and so I had rather read it, with Hierome and the Septuagint; because the
letter Jod may be wanting in Amarti. See the like Job 42.2. Ezekiel, 16.59. David
was here extra se abreptus, carried beyond himself, and so might easily speak
short, and say, Amart, for Amarti; like as Moses in a passion said to God, At
for Att^, Number. 11.15. as not able to speak out. Am^r Dei eft ecstaticus, etc.

Thou art my Lord] Heb. Thou my Lord, so the next words, My good not unto the^^
all concise and abrupt, out of deepest affection; broken language from a broken
spirit, spending and exhaling it self into Gods blessed bosom.

My goodness extends not to thee] But if it did, I could with all my heart
beteem it thee; even the very best of my best: but what can I give thee save
only (...), since all is thine own? I Chrow, 29, 14.16. Psalm. 24.1. thou need
no sacrifices Psalm. 50.8. neither art thou delighted therein. Psalm. 51.18. Isa.
1.11. All that thou requirest is mercy, H^s. 6.6. Mis. 6.8. Mat. 12.7.
Therefore I will seek out those thy Receivers, the Saints that are in the
earth, etc. See the Note on Job 35.6, 7, 8.

Verse. 3. Best to the Saints] The family of faith were, by a speciality, the
object of David's bounty. Socrates seeing a certain man giving alms to all he
met, were they good or bad, said, male pere as qui ex Gratiis cum sint
Virgins, facias scorta. David, the better to persuade with God to preserve him
safe to the Kingdom, promises two things; first, that he will cherish and
countenance the godly party; secondly, that he will cashier and cast out all
kind of Idolatry, and maintain to his utmost the sincere service of God. verse.
4.

And to the excellent] Or, Noble, glorious, wonderful, magnificent. The Saints
are Princes in all lands, Psalm. 45.16. of an excellent Spirit, Prove. 17.27.
More excellent than their Neighbors, dwell they wheresoever, Prove. 12.26. They
are styled the glory, Isa. 4.5. a Crown of glory, Isa. 62.3. a royal Diadem
ibid. a Kingdom of Priests, Exodus 19.6. higher than the Kings of the earth,
Psalm. 89.27. greater than the four famous Monarchies, Dan. 7.18. worthies of
whom the World is not worthy, Heb. 11.38. fitter to be set as stars in Heaven.
And surely as stars though seen sometimes in a puddle, or stinking ditch,
though they reflect there, yet have they their situation in Heaven. So the
Saints, though here in a low condition, yet are they fixed in the Region of
happiness.

In whom is all my delight] Heb. Cheptsibam; So the Church is called Gods
Cheptsibah, Isa. 62.5. Next to communion with God, the communion of Saints is
most delectable. It is the very being bound up in the bundle of life, which was
the blessing of Abigail upon David. Ipse aspectus viri boni delectat, says
Senecae, the very sight of a good man (morally good) delights; what then of a
Saint, Ezra. 10.3? This the Heathen Persecutors knew, and therefore banished
and confined the Christians to Isles and Mines, where they could not one come
at another, as Cyprian observes.

Verse. 4. Their sorrows shall be multiplied] Many sorrows shall be to those
wicked Idolaters, Vide Plutarch: (...).
Psalm. 32.10. some, of their own Creating by their superstitions and
will-worships; others, from a jealous and just God; others, from the Devil who
acts and agitateth them, beats and whippeth them (as at this day he does
the poor Indians, who worship Devils in most terrible figure; believing that
they are permitted of God to punish or spare them at their pleasure;) And some
they shall besure of from me, whenever I come to the Kingdom. Some, after the
Chaldee, read it, their Idols are multiplied. The old Heathens had thirty
thousand in Hesiods days; In China there are said to be at this day no fewer
than an hundred thousand Idols, which they use to whip if they come not at a
call to help them; Before a sick man they put the Devils picture, that he may
learn to know him in another World, It is storied of one King of England that
he bestowed as much upon a Cross as the revenues of his Kingdom came to in a
year.
and take him for his friend.

That hasten after another God] Or, that endow another God. Superstition is not
only painful, but chargeable. Idolaters lavish out of the bag, and spare for
no cost; witness the Papists vowed presents and memories as they call them
hanged up in honor of their he-Saints, and she-Saints, the Lady of Loretto
especially. But it was the Serpents grammar that first taught men to decline
God in the plural number, Eritis sicut Dii, as Damianus observes from Genesis
3.5. and hence that innumerable rabble. The Jesuits boast of their Ignatii
Apotheosis; and Cardinal Bembus is not ashamed to say of his St. Francis, quod
in deorum numerum ab Ecclesia Romana sit relatus. Hist. Venet,
Is not this abominable Idolatry? 1 Pet. 4.3.

Their drink offerings of blood] Many Heathens sacrifised to their Idols (that
is, to Devils) with man's blood, Eusebius. de praep. Evangil.
against all laws of humanity and piety. Thus they sacrifised to Bell^na the
Sister of Mars; as also with blood let out of their own arms. The Priests of
Baal (who perhaps was Mars) cut and launced themselves; 1 King. 18. So do the
Mohammedan Priests at this day; as the Papists whip themselves, etc. the old
Idolaters offered their Children in sacrifice to Moloch, or Saturn. David
abhors the thought of such inhumanities, Neque deos illegitimos, nec
illegiti^^^ colans, says he, I Will have no such doings.

Nor take up their names into my lips] But spit them out of my mouth with
utmost detestation, (...) ad (...)
according to the law, Exodus 23.13. It repented Austin that ever he had used
the word Fortune, that Heathen. Goddess. And Ab sit ut de ore Christian^ sonet
Jupiter omnipatens, etc. says Hier^me, Let no Christian mouth say, Jupiter
omnipotent, or swear Mehercule, Mecaster. The Primitive Christians would not
call their days of the week, dies Martis, Mercurii, etc. as Trismegist had
named them; but the first, second, third, etc, day of the week. All occasions
or semblances of Idolatry should be shunned; it is not safe being at Satan's
Mess, though our spoon be never so long, says One. See Hof. 3.16, 17. Zach.
13.2. Deuteronomy. 12.2.

Verse. 5. The Lord is the Portion of mine inheritance] Therefore I have neither
need nor mind to run a madding after dumb Idols* for he is Good original,
universal, all-sufficient and satisfactory, proportionable, and fitting to my
soul, so that having Him, I am abundantly provided for.

And of my cup] A phrase taken from those shares that every one had assigned
unto him at feasts, Genesis 43.34. 1 Samuel 1.4. and 9.23. q. d. Thou art my meat
and my drink Lord, and I am very well content with my condition, be it better
or worse. That which gives quiet in any portion, is first, The favor and
presence of God; secondly, that it is from the hand of a Father; thirdly, that it
comes to us in the covenant of grace; fourthly, that it is the purchase of
Christ's blood; fifthly, that it is an answer of prayers; and a blessing from
above on honest endeavors.

Thou maintainest my lot] Upholdest me in a good condition, who should
otherwise soon lose and forgo it, were it in mine own keeping. And here the
Psalmist uses four several words, all to the same sense, ad corroborandum
says R. David.

Verse. 6. The lines are fallen] In allusion to those lines wherewith they
measured Land, when they parted it. See Deuteronomy. 32.9. Psalm. 105.11. and 78.55.
Act. 26.18. Epes 1.11. David, having God for his portion, could say with Jacob,
I have all things, Genesis 33.11. Paul also says the same, Phil. 4.18. and
further, tells us, that having nothing, he set possessed all things; for why
he had got the divine art of contentation, verse. 12. and so could be either on
the top of Jacobs Ladder, or at the bottom; he could sing either Placentia or
Lachrymae, abound, or be abased, etc. Bern.
Sine Deo omnis copia est egostas.

In pleasant places] From the delectable Orchard of the Leonine Prison, Quis in
Deo (...) po^tio mea, (...) quasi in loco (...) maeno. R. David.
said that Italian Martyr, dating his Letter. Tua praesentia, Domine, Laurentio
ipsam craticulam dulcem fecit, said that Ancient; Thy presence, Lord, made
Laurence his gridiron pleasant to him.

Yea, I have a goodly heritage] I have as much (in content at least) as he who
has most. The Be is as well pleased with feeding on the dew, or sucking from
a flower, as Behemoth that grazeth on the Mountains. The Lark when alost,
sees further with a little eye, than the Ox, on the ground with a greater.

Atque suum tirilitirilitiritirlire cantat. Verse. 7. I will bless the Lord who
has given me counsel] David frequently consulted with God by Abiathar the
Priest; whom God, by a sweet providence, sent unto him with an Ephod for a
comfort in his banishment, 1 Samuel 22.20. Saul had slain those that ware the
Ephod, therefore God answered him not neither by dreams, nor by Vrim, nor by
Prophets, 1 Samuel 28.6. as he did his Servant David; who therefore blesses
him, when the other runs from him to the Witch for counsel, and from her to
the swords point.

My reins also instruct mee] God has not only illuminated me, whereby I
shall be the better able to endure a great fight of affliction, Heb. 10.32.
but he has also sanctified me, and honored me with holy inspirations, and
feeling of the Spirit of Adoption, whereby mine internal thoughts and secret
motions do dictate and suggest unto me what I ought to do and undertake.
Methinks I hear a sweet still voice within me, saying, This is the way, walk
in it; and this in the night-season, when I am rapt in rest and silence; or,
night after night, the Spirit is a continual spring of counsel and comfort
within me, prompting me to make God my portion, and to choose this good part
that shall never be taken away from me.

In the night-seasons] When commonly we are prone to evil ( Nox and Amor, etc.
Ovid.
Illa pudore vacat, etc.) and which is the wicked man's fittest opportunity, Job
24.13, 15, 16. etc. It must not content us that God by his word has given us
counsel, but we must labor to be inwardly taught of God. A man may read the
figure upon the Dial, but he cannot tell how the day goes, unless the Sun
shine upon the Dial; We may read the Bible over, and hear it opened and
applied, but can learn nothing till the Spirit shine into our hearts, 2 Cor. 4.
and so our reins instruct us, etc.

Verse. 8. I have set the Lord always before mee] Heb. I have equally set, or
proposed. Ex Syro Sermon.
The Apostle translateth it, I foresee the Lord always before my face, Act.
2.25. I set the eye of my faith full upon him, and suffer it not to take to
other things; I look him in the face, ocul^irretorto, as the Eagle looks upon
the Sun; and oculo adamantino, with an eye of Adamant, which turns only to one
point: so here, I have equally set the Lord before me, without irregular
affections and passions. And this was one of those lessons that his reins had
taught him, that the holy Spirit had dictated unto him.

Because h^e is at my right hand] To help me that I fall not, says R. David,
or as a thing that I cannot but remember, as being of continual use to me. It
is as necessary to remember God, as to draw breath, says Chrysostom.

I shall not be moved] i.e. not greatly moved, as Psalm. 62.2. though Satan
stand at the right hand of a godly man, to resist and annoy him, Zech. 3.1. yet
so long as God is at his right hand to assist and comfort him, and he at Gods
right hand, Psalm. 45.9. (which is a place of honor and safety) he cannot be
moved. The gates of Hell shall never prevail; Christ, our Sampson, has flung
them off their hinges.

Verse. 9. Therefore my heart is glad, etc.] That is, I am all over in very good
plight, as well as heart can wish, or need require; I do over-abound
exceedingly with joy; God forgive me mine unthankfullnesse and unworthiness
of so great glory, (as that Martyr said) In all the days of my life I was
never so merry, as now I am in this dark dungeon, etc. Wicked men rejoice in
appearance, and not in heart, Mr. Philpot.
2 Cor. 5.12. their joy is but skin-deep, their mirth frothy and flashy, such
as wetteth the mouth, but warmeth not the heart. But David is totus totus,
quantus quantus exultabundus, his heart, glory, flesh, (answerable, as some
think to that of the Apostle, 1 These. 5.23. Spirit, Soul, and Body) were all
over-joyed.

My flesh also shall rest (or confidently dwell) in hope] Namely in this World,
as in a wayfaring lodging; Diod.
then, in the grave as a place of safeguard and repose; and at last, in heaven,
as in its true and eternal mansion.

Verse. 10. For thou will not leave my soul in Hell] that is, my body in the
grave, ( -- animamque sepulchro condimus --) or in the State of the dead, Genesis
37.35. That Soul is sometimes put for a carcass or dead corpse, Virg. de
Polydori funere. Aeneid. 3.
See Job 14.22. Lev. 19.28. and 21. 1.11. Number. 5.2. and 6.6. and 19.13. which
place is expounded, Ezekiel, 44.25. David can confidently write upon his grave
Resurgam, I shall rise against. This, many Heathens had no hope of 1 These. 4.13.

Cum semel occider is,
Non Torquate, tuum genus, aut facundia, non te
Restituet pietas, etc. Horat. lib. 4. od. 7.

Yet some Heathens believed both the immortality of the soul, and therefore
durst dye ( -- animaque capaces Mortis --) and the Resurrection of the body, as
did Zoroastes, Theopompus, Plato; and as do the Turks at this day.

Neither will thou suffer thine holy One, etc.] that is, the Messiah, that is
to come out of my loins, and who says to me and all his Members (2s Isa.
26.19.) in effect, Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall
they arise, awake and sing ye that dwell in the dust, etc. See the Note on the
Title Michtam. The former part of this verse seems to be spoken of David, the
latter of Christ; like as Job. 35.15. the former part is of God, the latter of
Job. See the Margin. Christ's resurrection is a cause, pledge and suerty of the
Saints resurrection to glory; for joy whereof David's heart leapt within him.
Christ's body, though laid in the corrupting-pit, could not see, that is, feel
corruption. It was therefore a pious error in those good women who brought
their sweet odours to embalm his dead body, Luke 24.1.

Verse. 11. Thou will show me the path of life] This being applied to Christ,
seems to show that as man he did not yet fully understand that inexplicable
glory wherewith the Father would glorify him after death with himself, Job.
17.5. Sure it is, that David did not, nor can any man living, 1 Cor. 2.9.
Contra A^ ron, ab (...) (...) (...) sit illaetab unda; vel (...) and (ut vule
Pl^^ quod flua^^ ctuosis und^^
here is as much said, as can be said (but words are too weak to utter it:) For
quality, there is in Heaven joy, and pleasures. For quantity, a fullness, a
torrent, whereat they drink without let or loathing. For constancy, it is at
Gods right hand, who is stronger than all, neither can any take us out of his
hand; it is a constant happiness without intermission. And for perpetuity, it
is for evermore. Heavens joys are without measure, mixture, or end.

PSALM. XVII.
A Prayer of David] He was a man of prayer; but this was his appeal to God the
supreme Judge, as the word imports.

Verse. 1. Hear the right O Lord] Heb. Righteousness, which cries unto God no
less than blood does, Genesis 4. Or, hear the right, that is, my prayer, faith R.
David, rightly made with heart and voice. Or, Hear O righteous Lord, as Christ
also faith, O righteous Father, Joh. 17.

Attend unto my cry] Some profane persons bear well their crosses, because
their cause is good; but they cry not when God binds them, Job 36.13. Or,
Thucyd; Dio.
if they cry, they cry out of hard fortune, as the Athenians did when their
good General Nicias was slain, and their army routed in Cicily; or against
Dame Virtue, as if it were no more than a mere name, as Brutus did, when beaten
out of the field. Or, against Providence, as if there were a mist over the eye
of it, as Pompei did, when discomfited by Caesar; so blaming the Sun, because
of the soreness of his own blear eyes. But David (greatly wronged by Saul and
his Courtiers) by humble and hearty prayer makes his request known to God with
thanksgiving, Phil. 4.6. And this, like his harp, drove away the Evil spirit
of grief and discontent.

That goes not out of feigned lips] His devotion was not ludibrious, as is
that of Hypocrites; it was not an empty ring, a mere outside, the labor of
the lips, but the travel of the hurt; it was sincere and thorough-wrought, as
St. James has it; Wicked men speak God fair, but it is as the Devil did our
Savior, (...) Jam. 5.16:
to be rid of him, or as those, Psalm. 78.36. who flattered him with their
mouths, and lied unto him with their tongues.

Verse. 2. Let my sentence come forth from thy presence] Let it be both
pronounced, and executed forthwith.

Let thine eyes behold, etc.] i.e. Make it appear that thou both leest and
likest mine integrity; and that thou winkest not at men's wickednesses.

Verse. 3. Thou have proved my heart] And know me to be no dissembler and
traitor, as they wrongfully charge me, whilst they muse as they use.

Thou have visited me in the night] In which God is wont to stir up, and in
mind men of his will, Job 4.13, 14. as being all gathered within themselves;
and when the darkness does unmask them of worldly dissimulation.

Thou have tried mee] As Metallaries do their gold and silver.

And shall find nothing] Heb. have not found, (...) deficit, says Aben-Ezra;
no blot or blemish, that is, not the spot of Gods Children, Deuteronomy. 32.5. no
dross or deceit that may not well consist with godliness.

I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgresse] My general purpose is
such, though I may have my particular failings. I speak my whole heart, so
sarre as I know it. Magna est concordia cordis and oris.

Verse. 4. Concerning the works of men] sc. which ought to be done by them,
according to thy Law; Or, which they are wont to do, whether right or wrong, I
have not now to say, but this I can safely say by thy mercy, that

By the word of thy lips] Which I have taken for the rule and rudder of my life,

I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer] Effractoris, of the
breach-maker; such as is the Bridge-maker of Rome, at this day. David means
that he had shunned the society of graceless persons, Psalm. 26.4. Prove.
24.21. Jer. 15.17. and taken heed to his ways, that he offended not with his
tongue, whilst the wicked was present, Psalm 39.1, 2. lest the Wicked should
rejoice at his Misdemeanors, Psalm. 38.17.

Verse. 5. Hold up my goings in thy paths, etc.] Keep me within the circle of
thy Word, as thouhitherto have done; make me to walk exactly, and as in a
frame, Ephesians. 5.15. Grant me thy preventing, concomitant, and subsequent grace;
O thou God of all grace, perfect, strengthen, stablish me, 1 Pet. 5.10.

That my footsteps slip not] by the malice of Satan, who seeks to subvert such
as are most eminent, to the scandal of the weak, and scorn of the wicked; by
the corruption also of mine own heart, Qua quisque sibi Satan est, as one well
faith, whereby every man is a Satan to himself; could we but divorce the flesh
from the Devil, there would be no such danger: And lastly, by the allurements,
or affrightments of this present evil world; the way whereof is like the vale
of Siddim, slimy, and slippery, full of Lime-pits, and Pit-falls, Springs, and
stumbling blocks.

Verse. 6. I have called upon thee, for thou will hear me] q. d. Thou wast
always wont to hear me, and therefore I presume thou will. Experience breeds
confidence.

Incline thine ear] See how he re-enforceth his former request; as if he would
wring the blessing of out Gods hands by an holy violence, and take no denial.

Verse. 7. Show thy mavelous loving kindness, etc.] Mirificas benignitates
tuas; less than a mavelous mercifulness will not serve David's turn, he was so
hardly bestead; ut nisi miabiliter feceris, pereo. We now alive have lived in
an age of Miracles; and God has dealt with our Land, not according to his
ordinary course, but according to his Prerogative; by a Miracle of his Mercy
have we hitherto subsisted, and by a prop of his extraordinary patience.

O thou that savest, etc.] Servator sperantiam. Choice must be made in Prayer
of fit Titles and Attributes of God; such as may strengthen faith, and quicken
affection.

From those that rise up against them] Or, against thy right hand. The Saints
are at Christ's right hand, Psalm. 45.9. as Christ is at the Fathers; and he puts
his holy hand betwixt them and harm.

Verse. 8. Keep me as the apple of the eye] Heb. As the black of the apple of
the eye, two words to the same sense, for more vehemence. q. d. Serva me
studiosissime. The apple of the eye, that little man in the eye (as the Hebrew
word imports, the girl, (...) Huc pertinet locus Cicer. a De not. deor.
as the Greeks for like cause call it) is the tenderest piece of the tenderest
part, the eye; which is kept most diligently, and strongly guarded by Nature
with tunicles. David therefore fitly prays to be so kept.

Hide me under the shadow of thy wings] Another excellent similitude taken from
Fowls, which either cover their Young with their wings from the scorching heat
of the Sun beams, as does the Eagle; or keep them thereby from the cold, or
from the Kite, as Hens do. Gods love to, and care of his poor people is hereby
shadowed out; as it was likewise by the out-spread wings of the Cherubins in
the Sanctuary. See Ruth 2.12. Deuteronomy. 32.10. Zach. 2.8. Psalm. 36.8. and 57.2.
Matthew. 23.37.

Verse. 9. From the wicked that oppress me] Heb. That waste me, i.e. that cast
me out into banishment, despoyled of all. This hard usage of his enemies drove
David into Gods blessed Bosom; as Children misused abroad, run home to their
Parents.

From my deadly enemies] Heb. My enemies against the soul. i. e. the Life at
least, if not the soul, which they would gladly destroy. Some malice is so
mischeivous, that it would ruin Body and Soul together; as that Monster of
Millain, the enemies of John Husse, and Hierom of Prague, whose bodies they
delivered to the fire, and their Souls to the Devil. David elsewhere
complains of his enemies, that they did Satanically hate him. Psalm. 55 4.
Beware of men, says our Savior, Mat. 10. for one man is a Devil to another.

Verse. 10. They are enclosed in their own fat] See Job 15.27. with the Note.
They abound in all delights, Adipem suum obesant. Trem.
and therefore spare not to speak proudly. They have closed up their eyes in
their fulsome fat, ut non videant nec timeant te, says R. Solomon, that they
can neither see, nor fear thee.

With their mouth they speak proudly] Heb. in pride, that is, Palam and plenis
buccis; openly and with full mouth they contemn God and men; they belch out
Blasphemies, and do what they please.

Verse. 11. They have now compassed us in our steps] i.e. Me and my company; so
that we cannot stir any whither but we are in danger of them. In all thy ways
acknowledge God, and he shall direct thy paths, Prove. 3.6. Commit thy way unto
the Lord, trust also in him, etc. Psalm. 37.5. Keep within Gods Precincts, and
thou shall be under his protection. He took order that a Bird should be safe
upon her own Nest.

They have set their eyes bowing down to the earth] i.e. Hoc unum spectant ut
ruamus, Junius;
They are earnestly bent, and firmly resolved upon our ruin, as one that
fixes his eyes upon another, to mark him, or to know him again; or as Bulls
ready to run at one, set their eyes downward.

Verse. 12. Like as a Lion that is greedy, etc.] Cruelty and Craft are conjoined
in the Churches enemies; as the Aspe never wandreth alone, they say, without
his companion. David here points out some one special enemy ( Saul likely)
who should have been a Shepherd, but proved a Lion.

As a young Lion lurking] Therefore as we tender our safety, keep close to God,
out of whose hands none can take us, no not the roaring Lion of Hell.

Verse. 13. Arise, O Lord, disappoint him] Anticipa faciem ejus, that is, that
raging and ravening Lion; step between me and him, and stop his fury, defeat
his purpose, and disable his power.

Which is thy Sword] As Assyria is called the Rod of his Wrath. Attilas styled
himself, Orbis flagellum, the wrath of God, and the scourge of the World, Turk,
Hist.
So Tamerlan was commonly called, The Wrath of God, and Terror of the world.
Some render it, by thy Sword, i.e. or thy might and power. See Job 40.41. or by
thy Word execute thy judgment.

Verse. 14. From men which are thy hand] This, says one, is David's Letany, From
those men, etc. good Lord deliver me. Gods hand they are called, as before Gods
Sword. Titus, Son of Vespasian, being extolled for destroying Jerusalem, said,
I have only lent God my hand, but he has done the work.

From men of the World] Heb. A mortuis, i. e. impiis qui sunt mortui in vits
eorum. R. Gion.
From Mortals of this transitory world, qui sunt mundani, mundum spirant and
sapiunt, the inhabitants of the earth, and of the sea, as opposed to the
Citizens of the New Jerusalem, Rev. 12.12. such as having incarnated their
souls (as that Father speaks) are of the earth, speak of the earth, and the
earth hears them, Job. 3.31. mind earthly things only, as if they were born
for no other purpose. Terrigene fratres animam habentes triticeam, as those
Stallfed beasts in the Gospel.

Which have their portion in this life] And they love to have it so; saying
with the Prodigal, Give me the Portion that belongs to me. They crave it, and
they have it, but with a vengeance. (Munera magna quidens misit, sed misit in
hamo) As the Israelites had Quails to choke them, and afterward a King to vex
them, a table to be a snare to them, etc. By the way observe, that wicked men
have a right to earthly things (a man must needs have some right to his
portion; what Ananias had was his own whilst be had it, Acts 5.) and it is a
rigor to say, they are Usurpers. As when the King gives a Traitor his life,
he gives him meat and drink that may maintain his life; So is it here: neither
shall wicked men be called to account at the last day for possessing what they
had, but for abusing that possession. As for the Saints who are heirs of the
world with faithful Abraham, and have a double portion, even all the blessings
of Heaven and of Earth conferred upon them, though here they be held to strait
allowance, let them live upon reversions, and consider that they have right to
all, and shall one day have rule of all, Rev. 3. Mendicato pane hic vivamus,
annon hoc pulchre sarcitur? etc. What though we here were to live upon Alms,
says Luther, is there not a good amends made us, in that here we have Christ
the bread of life in his Ordinances, and shall hereafter have the full fruition
of him in Heaven? The whole Turkish Empire is nothing else but a crust cast by
our Father to his Dogs; and it is all they are likely to have, let them make
them merry with it. Wilt not thou (says another) be content, unless God let
down the vessel to thee, as to Peter with all manner of Beasts of the Earth,
and Fowls of the Air, Acts 10.12. Must you needs have first and second course?
Difficile est ut praesentibus bonis quis fruatur and futuris; ut hic ventrem
illic mentem reficiat, ut de delici^s ad delicias transeat, ut in coelo and in
terra gloriosus appareat, says Hierom, It is a very hard thing to have Earth
and Heaven too, etc. Gregory the Great trembled whenever he read those words
of Abraham to the rich Glutton (who thought this life to be his saginary or
boares-frank) Son, remember that thou in thy life time receivedst thy good
things, Luke 16. Ye have lived in pleasure upon earth, Jam. 5.5. no fit place
for such a purpose. God did not turn you out of one Paradise that you should
here provide your selves of another; earth is a place of banishment and
bondage. Of the wickeds prosperity here, see Job 21.7, 8. with the Notes.

And whose belly thon fillest with thy bid treasures] That is, with Gold, and
other precious things dug out of the earth, says Aben-Ezra; Opimis rebus,
says Junius; with abundance of outward blessings and benefits, says another;
which are called Gods hidden treasures, not because they are not seen, but
because they are not so well perceived and used of the ungodly, as were meet;
or because the reason of their present plenty of all things is hidden from
them, and yet it appears not but shall be made manifest that these fatting
ware are but fitting for the slaughter.

They are full of Children] which they send forth as a flock, Job 21.11. See
the Note there. Or, their Children are full carne porcina, says the Arabic
here, or of wordly wealth, and mountains of money left them by those faithful
drudges, their rich, but wretched Parents and progenitors, whose only care was
to heap up hoards of wealth for their posterity.

Verse. 15. As for mee] I neither envy, nor covet these men's happiness, but
partly have and partly hope for a far better.

I will behold thy face in Righteousnesse] which none can do but the pure in
heart, Mat. 5. and those that keep close to God in a constant communion, being
justified and sanctified persons.

I shall be satisfied] Better than those muck-worms and their Children are.

When I awake] sc. Out of the dust of death, at the Resurrection.

With thy likenesse] With the visible sign of thy glory in Heaven, 1. Job. 3.2.

PSALM. XVIII.
TO the chief Musician] Some render it Adtriumphandum; and well they may; for
this is old David's (...), or triumphant song after so many victories and
deliverances; and it is twice recorded in Scripture, with very little variation
(See 2 Samuel 22.) for the great worth and weightinesse of the matter; that we
may the more observe it, and be the better versed in it. This here recorded
seems to be the Review of it, and thence those small additions and
alterations that are found here and there, but not of any great moment.

A Psalm of David] Who having now gotten some breathing while from his
troubles, gave not himself to Idleness, or worldly pleasures (as the Romans
used to do after that they had once ridden in triumph) but calling to mind Gods
great mercies toward him, composed this sweet Psalmodie to his glory.

The Servant of the Lord] So he styled himself before, Psalm. 36. when he
first entered upon the Kingdom; and now here again, when being to lay it down
together with his life, he breaths out his holy soul to God in this divine
ditty.

Sic ubi fata vocant, etc. This he did after that as a faithful servant of
the Lord he had done all the wills of God, Act. 13.22, had served out his full
time, Verse 36. and dwelt in Gods house to length of days, Psalm. 23.6.

Who spoke unto the Lord the words of this song] God lets out his mercies to us
for this rent of our praises; and is content we have the benefit of them, so
he may have the glory. The Hebrews give this Note here; Every man for whom
there is wrought a miracle of mercy, and he thereupon utters a song, has
his sins forgiven him. This is better yet than that of the Papists who promise
pardon of sin to those that shall hear two Masses a day. We, who have received
so many mercies, should compass God about with songs of deliverances, and not
only servire Deo, sed and adulari, as Tertullian has it.

From the hand of all his enemies] Heb, From the Palm, of other enemies as less
considerable, but from the hand (or clutch-fist) of Saul.

And from the hand of Saul] his greatest enemy, and of longest continuance. So
Christ is said to save his people from their sins, by a specialty, Mat. 1.21.
because these do us the most mischief.

Verse. 1. I will love thee, O Lord my strength] Heb. I will love thee dearly
and entirely, Ex intimis visceribus, from the very heart root, from the bottom
of my bowels; with like intention of affection, as a tenderhearted Mother does
her dearest Babe, that is her own bowels, her self of the second edition.
Neither did David herein super-erogate; for God requires to be loved with all
the heart, mind, soul, strength, Modus sig si^^ modo. Be^^
as one that is best worthy; good without measure, that has loved us without
measure, and therefore is without measure by us to be beloved. Not that we are
bound to love God in quantum est diligibilis, so much as he is lovely, or
love-worthy; for so God only can love himself; but, Nihil supra, aeque, aut
contra, Nothing must we love above God, or so much as God, much less against
God: we must be able to say affectionately with David, Psalm. 73.25, 26. Whom
have I in heaven but thee? there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
And as Bernard, Amo te Domine, plus quam mea, meos, me, I love thee Lord, more
than my goods, my friends, my self. A Christian begins with loving God for
himself, but he ends in loving himself, and all other, both persons, and
things, in and for God. His friend he loves in the Lord, his foes for the
Lord: but God he loves absolutely, and for himself, affecting not only an
union with him, but even an unity, his heart being turned, as it were, into a
very lump of love, as was Mary's, Luke 7.47. Histories tell of a certain Woman
that came to Vespasian the Emperor, professing that she was in love with him;
he commanded that a liberal reward should be given her for the same; and when
his Steward asked him under what Item he should put that gift in his Book of
Account, Vespasiano adamato, said the Emperor, Item, To her that loved
Vespasian. God, says the Apostle, is not unrighteous, to forget your labor of
love, etc. Heb. 6. I love them that love me, says Christ, Prove. 8. and his
love is not like the Winter Sun, which has light, but not heat, etc. he is the
strength of his people, their Rock, Fortress, etc.

Verse. 2. The Lord is my Rock, and my Fortress, etc.] i.e. He is all in all for
my preservation. Ten words say the Hebrews, he here heapeth up in reference to
Ten signal Victories; or rather because his thankful heart was so enlarged,
that he could never satisfy himself in saying what God had been to him, and
done for him: and hence this congeries, or heap of holy expressions; and all to
show that God is a Rock of refuge, a firm Fortress, a recepracle of rest, a
sanctuary of safety to all his Saints in time of trouble. David had had his
share, and had been put to his shifts; glad to hide himself, as he could, in
rocks, and strongholds that sheltered him from the storm. To these he
alludeth, when he calls God his Rock, Fortress, etc.

And my deliverer] Rocks, and Strongholds do not always deliver (witness the
Shechemites, Jebusites, Arimasphes), but God always does.

And the Horn of my Salvation] Qui veluti cornu petit and conficit hosts meos,
says Vatablus, who goareth and dispatcheth mine enemies. A Metaphor either
from horned Beasts, or else (as some will have it) from the ancient custom of
wearing horns of Iron upon their Helmet, for a Crest, or Military ornament:
^whereupon the raised Horn was a sign of Victory, and the Horn beaten down a
sign of being overcome.

Verse. 3. I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised] Or, is the
proper object of praises, because he is good, and does good, Psalm. 119.68.
David vows to praise him,

1 By loving him entirely.

2 By trusting in him steadfastly, verse. ^.

3. By calling upon him continually, here, and Psalm. 116.2, 3. which Psalm is
very like to this (in the beginning especially) both for matter and method.

So shall I be saved, etc.] He had often proved the power of Prayer, specially
when he came ready prepared to praise God for the return of Prayer; and thence
he is bold to promise himself all good.

Verse. 4. The sorrows of death compassed mee] Or, the pangs, pains, throws as
of a traveling woman, these environed me, or came thick and threefold upon
me, perventebant usque ad (...) even to my face, (as the Rabbines descant upon
the word) or flew upon me; desperate and deadly dangers assailed me. The worst
of an evil escaped, Medrash. Tillin. Aphaphuni pro ^naphaphuni.
is to be thankfully acknowledged, and highest strains of eloquence therein
to be used, so that pride be avoided, and the praise of God only aimed at.

And the floods of ungodly men] Heb. of Belial, that is, of Belialists, acted
and agitated by the Devil; these came tumbling upon him like many and mighty
waters, Fluct us flustum trudit. Torrentes Belial terrebant me.

Verse. 5. The sorrows] Or, throws or cords, such as wherewith they bind
malefactors led forth to execution.

The snares of death prevented mee] David knew how to make the most of a mercy;
he means, I was almost surprised, and all hope of help seemed to be
prevented; if help should come, it would come too late.

Verse. 6. In my distress I called upon the Lord] This was David's anchora
sacra; prayer he knew could never come too late, nor God want a way to deliver
his distressed. The time of affliction, is the time of supplication; and man's
extremity is Gods opportunity.

And cried unto my God] He grew more and more earnest; we must pray and not
faint, Luke 18.1. but rise in our suits.

Out of his Temple] i.e. Heaven, where of the Temple was a type, as being the
place of Gods special presence, and of transcendent holiness.

Verse. 7. Then the earth shook and trembled, etc.] Upon David's prayer all this
befell; like as Act. 4. the house shook wherein they were praying; and the
thundering Legion procured thunder and rain; and so did Samuel by his prayers,
1 Samuel 12. But this terrible tempest here described is to be taken rather
allegorically than historically. The Prophet in most lofty and lively terms
and expressions (far above the strain of the most sublime either Poets or
Orators) describes Gods powerful presence and concurrence in David's
conquests.

The foundations also of the hills] That is, so vehement was the Earthquake,
that it shook, as it were the roots of the Mountains, which lie deep within the
ground, 2 Samuel 22.8. these hills are called the foundation of Heaven, as Job
26.11. the pillars of Heaven; because the tops of high Mountains seem to touch
the clouds, and the Heavens seem to lean upon them; and because the Earth is in
the center of the World, about the which the Heavens do continually turn.

Because he was wroth] Or, burn did his nose. So

Verse. 8. There went up a smoke out of his nostrills] As angry men breath
vehemently, and seem to spit fire by their blustering speeches and menaces, so
here (...) omnia, qua tamen (...) sunt intelligenda.

Verse. 7. He bowed the Heavens] i.e. velociter venit, says R. David, he came
speedily to destroy mine enemies.

And darkness was under his feet] He came invisible.

Verse. 10. And he rode upon a Cherub] Which word has affinity with Rechub a
Charret; Hereby is noted Gods swiftness in coming to succor David. He waits
to be gracious; and when it is a fit season he comes leaping and skipping
over the Mountains of Bether or division, all lets, and impediments; Gabriel
came to Daniel with weariness of flight, chap. 9.21.

He did fly upon the wings of the Wind] For, by the Ministry of Angels, God
raises and stilleth the winds.

Verse. 11. Vatab.
He made darkness his secret place] As a King, that being angry, withdraws
himself from his subjects, and will not be seen of them. Vel quia decret a Dei
veniunt invisibiliter, said R. David.

Verse. 12. At the brightness that was before him, etc.] i.e. at his bright
presence, his thick clouds (wherein he was inveloped) passed, or did cleave as
it were in sunder; whence came hailstones mixed with coals of fire, or
lightnings out of the clouds which God makes at once aerie seas, and aerie
furnaces; fetching fire out of the midst of water, and hard stones out of the
midst of thin vapors.

Verse. 13. The Lord also thundered in the Heavens] Quasi pro classico, and
a^spicio praeli^ineund^.

Verse. 14. Yea he sent out his arrows, etc.] Tandem permisc entur omnia
grandine flammis and fulminibus tanquam telis and sagittis Dei adversus hosts
pugnantis. After the vaunt-curriers, verse. 12. the great Ordinance, verse. 13.
the battle begins, and all is on an hurry.

Verse. 15. Then the Channels of waters were seen] The force of this terrible
Tempest is further set forth by the effect of it, a dreadful concussion of the
universe; not without an allusion to the drying up of the red Sea, and of
Jordan before Israel; which deliverances stood for Archetypes, or chief
patterns to all Posterity.

Verse. 16. He sent from above, he took me] He rescued me as by an hand reached
me from Heaven. Deus (...); or, he sent his Angels to secure me.

He drew me out of many waters] As he had once done Moses, Exodus 2.10. who
there-hence also had his name. Musaeus, for the same cause, calls him (...)
Water-sprung.

Verse. 17. He delivered me from my strong enemy] Saul; this he often instanceth,
rolling it as Sugar under his tongue, and turning aside often to look upon it,
as Sampson did to see his dead Lion; fetching Honey out of it.

For they were too strong for me] And then Gods help was most seasonable, when
David found himself over-matcht.

Verse. 18. They prevented me, etc.] They took me on the sudden, and unprovided.
The Children of this World are wiser, etc.

But the Lord was my stay] Or, my staff, whereon I so leaned as that if he had
failed me, I had been all along.

Verse. 19. He bronght me forth also, etc.] He freed me out of all straights,
and stated me in a most happy condition.

He delivered, because he delighted in me] All was of free grace and favor,
not of any merit. And this he purposely premiseth as a caution to the ensuing
profession of his innocence.

Verse. 20. The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness] viz. The
righteousness of my Cause; and my freedom from such crimes of disloyalty, and
ambition, wherewith mine enemies charged me, as if pricked on by my pride I
sought the Kingdom. As also, according to mine honest desire and endeavor in
all things else, ^o keep a good Conscience, void of offense toward God, and
men. This, though Gods own work, and a debt most due to him, yet he is pleased
graciously to reward.

Verse. 21. For I have kept the ways of the Lord] For the main, and for the most
part, though not without some particular stumblings and startings aside,
against my general resolution, and the tendency of mine heart.

And have not wickedly departed from my God] By an utter defection; I have not
been transformed into Sins Image, by projecting sin, by falling into it with
full consent, and by lying under the power of it. Non ex superbia sed errore,
says R. David here; not of presumption have I offended, or with an high hand,
but of infirmity, and with reluctance; rising up again by repentance, and
renewing my Covenant.

Verse. 22. For all his Judgments were before mee] Mine obedience (in desire
and endeavor at least) was universal, extending to the compass of the whole
Law; and this is a sure sign of sincerity: Hence in the next words,

Verse. 23. I was also upright before him] This he had because he kept Gods
Commandments, as Verse. 22. had respect to them all, Psalm. 119.6. both to the
Magnalia, and minutula legis, which he kept as the apple of his eye, Prove. 7.2.
even all Gods Wills, Act. 13.22. and was therefore approved in Christ, as
Apelles, Romans 16.10. and passed for an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile,
as Nathaniel, Joh. 1.47.

And I kept my self from mine iniquity] i.e. from my peccatum in delic^is, my
darling sin, whereto I am either by Nature or Custom most inclined and
addicted. From the iniquity of my heart and secret thoughts, which no man can
charge me with, says Aben-Ezra; from that sin of disloyalty, R. David.
which Saul and his Courtiers falsely charge me with, Say others.

Verse. 24. Therefore has the Lord recompensed me] See on verse. 20. Reward and
Mercy are joined together in the Second Commandment; and Psalm. 62.12. it is a
mercy in God to reward a man according to his work.

According to the cleaneness of my hands in his eye sight] i.e. which he has
beheld in me; Qua illo judice praeditus dum. Vatab.
though mine enemies were of another judgment.

Ver. 25 With the merciful, etc.] Hypothesin hic ad thesin transfert; it is as
if the should say, I and mine enemies are a pattern of thy Truth and Justice,
that thou will do good to those that are good, and to them that are upright in
their hearts. As for such as turn aside unto their crooked paths, thou Lord
shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity, Psalm. 125.4, 5.

Verse. 26. With the pure, etc.] Cum candido candide agere soles. The pure shall
have all that heart can with.

And with the froward thou will show thy self froward] Or, thou will wrestle,
viz. with such cross pieces, as proudly and perversely err from thy precepts;
as it were on purpose to thwart thee, or to try Masteries with thee. Against
such stubborn persons God threatens not eight degrees (which are the highest
Notes in Music, and degrees in qualities, as the Philosopher distinguishes
them) but twenty and eight degrees of wrath, Levit. 26.18, 21, 24, 28. Exiget
ab ^is rationem minutissimorum, says R. Obad. Gaon upon this Text; he will
reckon with them for their least offenses, and not bate them an Ace of their
due punishment. He will pay them home in their own coin, over-shoot them in
their own Bow, fill them with their own ways, be as cross as they are, for the
hearts of them; yet still in a way of Justice, though he break the necks of
them in wrestling, and send them packing to their place in Hell. Ainsworth
renders it, With the froward thou will show thy self wry. It is a Similitude
taken from Wrastlers, and notes a writhing of ones self against an adversary.
Compare herewith Deuteronomy. 32.5. They are a perverse and crooked Generation (the
same two words that are here in this Text) the latter imports, that they
wriggled and writhed after the manner of Wra^^lers that wave up and down* and
wind the other way, when one thinks to have them here or there. But all will
not serve their turn to save them from punishment. God will be sure to meet
with them, his Word will lay hold on them, and their sin shall find them out.

Verse. 27. For thou will save the afflicted people] Even the same whom before
he had called Merciful, or godly, upright, pure, here are the Afflicted, and
seem by God to be neglected; but he will save them assuredly though he bear
long with them, Luke 18.7.

But will bring down high looks] In Samuel it is, Thine eyes are upon the
haughty, that thou may bring them down, 2 Samuel 22.28. q.d. Gods eyes are upon
them all the while that he spares them, to watch for a fit season to ruin
them.

Verse. 28. For thou will light my Candle] Or, Thou have lighted my Candle (that
is, thou have bettered my condition) which seemed to be put out in obscurity.
The wicked man's is, Job 18 6. and 21.17. Prove. 13.9.

The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness] He has, and yet still will turn
my grief into joy, as Hest. 8.19. and mean while direct and comfort me in mine
Afflictions; as a Candle is a great comfort in the dark, though it does not
make Day where it comes, as the Sun does.

Verse. 29. For by thee have I run through a Troop] Though but a little man, yet
by Gods help heatchieved great matters, did great exploits. Homo tricubitalis
(says a Father concerning Paul) Et coelum ascendit: so here. Some render it,
Currebam accinctus, Bucholc.
I ran well appointed; and they interpret it of his Victory over Goliath, whom
he ran upon and cut off his head, after that he had hurled at him with as good
a force; Perinde ac si fundae sustunicis non lapillum, sed Deum ipsumin^uisset
ac implicuisset, says one; as if he had got not a stone, but God himself into
the bought of his sling.

And by my God have I leapt over a wall] That is, I have stormed a walled Town,
or Fort, with very little ado; being no less valiant and venturous than
Alexander the Great was among the Indians; but upon far better grounds,
because in the strength of God, 2 Samuel 3.
as at the Fort of Zion.

Verse. 30. As for God, his way is perfect] All his Dispensations toward his
Children, his actions, and directions, his providence, and promises are most
trusty and true; having neither vice, vanity, insincerity, nor deceit in them.

The Word of the Lord is tried] This is a famous sentence, and was much in the
mouths of Gods people, See Prove. 30.5. with the Note there.

Verse. 31. For who is God save the Lord] Fictitios Deos and vanas spes
prosternit, says Vatablus; Here he strikes down to the ground all false gods,
and all vain hopes. Contemno minutulos istos Deosmodo Jovem mihi propitium
habeam, said an Heathen. David might much better say, I care not for those
petty Deities, so I may have Jehovah to favor me.

Verse. 32. It is God that girdeth me with strength] It is a Metaphor, says
Vataeblus, either from a Soldiers belt which buckleth his armor close to him,
and makes him more steady; or else from the reins themselves, in which the
Scripture sometimes places strength and vigor. God did all for David; and
has here the glory of all his valor and victories.

And makes my way perfect] i.e. Compleateth and prospers all my designs and
enterprises. For want hereof many attempt much, but effect little or nothing.
Antiochus King of Syria was called Magnus for undertaking much, and performing
little. Guicciard^n says of Charles the eighth, in his expedition to Naples,
that he came into the field like thunder and lightning, but went out like a
snuff; more than a man at first, and less than a woman at last.

Verse. 33. He makes my feet like Hindes feet] Heb. He matcheth my feet, like
Hindes feet; that is, not only swift, if I have occasion by flight to provide
for my self, or to pursue mine enemies flying before me; but also steady if I
come into any dangerous places. Asahel was swift of foot as a wild Roe, 2 Samuel
2.18. Josephus faith of him, that he contended with horses in running. Saul
and Jonathan are said to be swifter than Eagles, 2 Samuel 1.23. Achilles was
(...), says Homer, The Hind, when pursued by the woolf, runs most swiftly;
witness the Poet, Quem tu, cervus uti vallis in altera
Visum part lupum, graminis immemor, Horat. lib. 1. Od. 1^ lib. 1. Od. 23.

sublimi fugies mollis anhelitu.
Vit as hinnuleo me similis, Chloe, etc.


And gain,

But they that wait upon the Lord have a promise that they shall not only nin
as Hindes, but mount up as Eagles; they shall run and not be weary, and they
shall walk and not faint, Isa. 40.31.

He sets me upon my high places] Where, having by flight or fight escaped,
Securus post quam Eva^^ a illis. R. David
I am secured; yea he has advanced me, and brought me to this high honor.

Verse. 34. He teaches mine hands to warre] David ascribes all his military
skill and success to God, so did not other great Warriors, Alexander, Scipio,
Fabius, etc. but sacrificed to their own nets, and were ready to say as
Sesostris King of Egypt did, when he had conquered any Country, he was wont
to set up pillars with these words engraven upon them, This Country I got by
mine own strength and valor. (...) Herodot. 1.^


So that a bow of steel, etc] Which is more flexible and stronger than a bow of
Iron; whence is that. Job 20.24.

Verse. 35. Thou have also given me, etc.] i.e. Thou have preserved and settled
me. See the Note on Psalm. 5.12.

And thy gentleness bath made me great] Or, Thy meekness has multiplied
me, i.e. Thou have so far stooped to my meannesse, as to advance me to this
height of honor. Or, by thy humbling me, thou have magnified me, according
to 1 Pet. 5.6. and Prove. 15.33.

Verse. 36. Thou have enlarged my steps under mee] Or, Thou have widened my
passage, and made roomth for me; when the wicked man's strong passages are
streightened, Job 18.7. his pase impeded.

And my feet did not slip] Heb. Mine anckles, or my heels, Sep. my footsteps.

Verse. 37. I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them, etc.] Of David we
may say, as one did of Julius Caesar, you may perceive him to have been an
excellent soldier by his very language; for he wrote with the same spirit he
fought. 1.10 ad filiu^
In eo tanta vis, id acumen, ea concitatio, (says Quintilian concerning
Caesar's Commentaries) ut illum eodem animo dixisse appareat quo bellavit.

Verse. 38. I have wounded them that they were not able to rise] Much less to
resist. And herein he was a type of Christ; all whose foes shall be his
footstool, Psalm. 110.1.

Verse. 39. Thou bast girded me with strength, etc.] See verse. 32. It is God
that weakeneth or strengthens either party, Ezekiel. 30.24. and renders their
weapons vain or prosperous. Isa. 54. ult. Jer. 50.9.

Thou have subdued under me, etc.] David ascribes all to God, and uses
wonderful variety of expressions in setting forth his benefits.

Verse. 40. Thou have given me the necks of mine enemies] sc: to chop them off
at my pleasure; or to cut the throats.

Verse. 41. They cryed] Through grief and impatiency, clamore incondito, as
beasts when in durance, fill the air with loud outcries.

Even unto the Lord] As nature prompteth men in an extremity to look up for
help; but because it is but the prayer of the flesh for ease, and not of the
Spirit for grace, and a good use of calamities, and not but in extreme despair
of help elsewhere, therefore God hears them not. In Samuel it is, They looked,
but there was none to save them, q. d. If they could have made any other shift,
God should never have heard of them. Therefore Sero, inquit Nero.

Verse. 42. Then did I beat them as small as the dust] When God once withdraws
his protection and help from a people, it is an easy matter to tread them down
and beat them in pieces, Lay hold upon him therefore as the Church did, and
hang on. Say as Jer. 14.21. Do not abhor us for thy names sake; for as Bodin
said well of obtaining, so for retaining religion and civil rights, Non
disputationibus, sed rogationibus agendum, prayer is most prevalent. If once
our shadow depart, etc. woe be unto them when I depart from them.

I did cast them out, etc.] Evacuabameos, I dealt by them, as men do by the
sweepings of the house, or noisome excrements. God sometimes dungeth his
Vineyard with the dead bodies of his enemies.

Verse. 43. Thou have delivered me from the strivings of the people] viz. In
the rebellions under Absalom, and Sheba the son of Bichri. These, like bubbles
which Children blow up into the air, were soon blown out; and fell into the
eyes of those who with the blasts of disloyalty and ambition held up the same.

Thou have made me head of the Heathen] Philistines, Syrians, Anamonites, etc.
This is most true of Christ. Head of his Church, which consists of all
Nations, and most of these were unknown unto him as man; and by hearing of him,
they were brought to submit unto him, when the Apostles came and preached him
amongst them. Hence it follows,

Verse. 44. As Soon as they hear of mee] Heb. at the hearing of the ear; that is,
by the preaching of the Gospel they shall be brought to yield the obedience
of faith.

The strangers shall submit] Heb. Subjectio sucosa and Hypoc^itica.
Falsely deny or dissemble with me; their submission is forced and feigned,
they dare do no less; they receive my yoke, but their hearts I have not.
Christ has many such false-hearted subjects, fawning and faining profligate
professors, carnal Gospellers, and.

Verse. 45. The strangers shall fade away] As do the dry leaves of Trees; their
vigor and confidence shall perish in a moment.

And be afraid out of their close places] Whence they shall come creeping to
me their conqueror, to seek favor. And this may very fitly also be applied to
Christ and his subjects, who must be driven unto him out of their close
places, or starting holes of self-confidences, self-conceitednesse, etc. by the
spirit of bondage, before they will unfeignedly submit to Christ's Government.

Verse. 46. The Lord liveth] Or, Vivat Dominus, Let the Lord live. It is spoken,
says Calvin, after the manner of men, who use such kind of acclamations to the
Kings, whom they love and honor. The Wicked could wish God extinct, that so
they might never come to an account before him; but the Saints cry out, Let the
Lord live, let Christ reign, etc. Blessed be God that Hoe is God, was a
learned man's motto. Luthers was, Vivit, sc. Christus. Si non viveret, vellem me
non unam horam vivere, etc. Christ is alive, otherwise I would not wish to live
an hour. Another good man says, Miconius.
Christ lives and reigns, alioque totus totus desperassem, otherwise I
should be utterly out of hope.

Let the God of my salvation be exalted] Triumphali elogio ab omnibus
celebratur, let him be set up in all hearts and houses,

Verse. 47. It is God that avengeth mee] Heb. that gives vengeances for me,
whence also he is called the God of vengeances, Psalm. 94.1. and the God of
recompenses, Jer. 51.56.

And subdueth the people under me] It is the great work of God, to persuade the
hearts of so many millions to obey one man.

Verse. 48. He delivers me from mine enemies] This David has never done with,
but goes over it again and again, as desirous to do the Lord all the right
that might be.

From the violent man] That is, from Saul, says R. David, and him he
mentions last, Quia erat principium omnis Davidicae gloriae, because the fall
of his house was the rise of all David's glory. The Chaldee has it, From Gog,
and his Armies.

Verse. 49. Therefore I will give thanks, etc.] See how the Psalmist in these
three last Verses ends as he began.

Among the Heathen] This the Apostle applies to Christ and his people, as a
Prophecy of his Kingdom, and of the calling of the Gentiles, Romans 15.9. I, that
is, Christ, (but yet in the person of his faithful, and especially his
Ministers) will praise thee, or confess unto thee, etc.

And sing praises unto thy name] Which to have done absurdum fuisset apud
surdo^, would have been absurd, had not those Heathens had their ears opened.

Verse. 50. Great deliverance gives be to his King] In Samuel it is, He is the
tower of Salvation for his King] This Tower is Messiah, say the Jew-Doctors,
Quiest turris salutis. O that those poor Creatures would once run to that
strong tower and be safe.

To David and to his seed for evermore] That is, to Christ (who was made of the
Seed of David, according to the flesh, Romans 1.3. Act. 13.23.) and to all
faithful Christians who are called Christ's Seed, Isa. 53.10. and Psalm. 72.17.
Filiabitur nomine ejus, the Name of Christ shall endure for ever, it shall be
begotten as one Generation is begotten of another, there shall be a succession
of it to the Worlds end.

PSALM. XIX.
THe Heavens declare the glory of God] The World, says Clemens Alexandrinus,
is Dei Scriptura, the first Bible that God made for the institution of man. The
Heavens (here instanced as a chief part of that Mundi totius machina) are
compared to a Scroul that is written, Rev. 6.14. As in a Horn-book, which
little ones carry, there be Letters in a paper within, which appear through the
same; so under the blew sapphire of the Firmament, is spread a sheet of royal
Paper written all over with the Wisdom and Power of God. This Book was
imprinted (says one) at the New Jerusalem, by the Finger of Jehovah, and is
not to be sold, but to beseen, at the sign of Glory, of every one that lifts up
his eyes to Heaven; where he may plainly perceive, Deum esse mentem,
Architectricem, intelligentem, sapientem, potentem, etc. This lesson is fairly
lined out unto us in the brows of the Firmament, which therefore we are bidden
to behold and discern; since therein God has made himself visible, yea legible,
even his eternal Power and Godhead; so that men are left without excuse, Romans
1.20. But because this Book of Nature (with its three great Leaves, Heaven,
Earth, and Sea) though never so diligently read over, cannot bring a man to the
saving knowledge of God in Christ, nor make him perfect, thoroughly furnished
unto all good works; behold another and better Book, even that of the Holy
Scriptures, set forth, verse. 7, 8. etc. of this Psalm, that like as where the
Philosopher ends, the Physician begins, so where Nature fails us,
Scripture may inform and comfort us. In this excellent Psalm then we have the
sum of all true Divinity, says Reverend Beza, the end whereof is to give us
that knowledge of God, and of his holy Worship, whereby we may be made
partakers of eternal life. Here then in the six first Verses the Prophet
shows, that God manifests his glory to Mankind by his Works; and first by
the Work of Creation, verse. 1. Next, of Government, verse. 2, 3, etc. and that,
1. In the revolution of the starry Sky, which revolution, first causes a
perpetual vicissitude of Days, and Nights, and so declares the glory of God.
2. It bespeaketh all people at once as a Catholic Preacher of Gods glory,
verse. 4, 5. Secondly, In the constant course of the Sun (that common Servant as
his Name imports) verse. 4. who with his motion, verse. 5. enlightneth all
things with his Light, Foord.
and pierces all things with his Heat, verse. 6. Thus the Heavens declare the
glory of God; that is, they yield matter and occasion of glorifying, him
according to that Psalm. 145.10. All thy Works praise thee, O Lord, but thy
Saints bless thee. Some Philosophers, and with them some Rabbis, have deemed,
Maimonides
or rather doted, that the Heaven was a living Creature, and did actually
praise and serve God. But this conceit is exploded by the wiser sort; and that
Axiom maintained, Formica coelos dignitate superat, a Pismire (because a living
Creature) is more excellent than the whole visible Heavens. As for the Saints
and Servants of God, it is truly affirmed by Divines, that there is not so much
of the glory of God in all his Works of Creation, and Providence, as in one
gracious action that they perform.

And the Firmament shows his handy-work] The Expanse or out-spread Firmament.
It is taken both for the Air, Genesis 1.6. and for the Sky, Genesis 1.14. the whole
Cope of Heaven, which shows, Quam eleganter and ad amussim operetur Deus
manibus suis.; Vatablus,
how neatly and exactly God works with his hands, which are attributed to him
for our weakness sake.

Verse. 2. Day unto day utters speech] Some read it, one day succeeding
another utters (or Welleth out, Sicur fons scaturiens. R. Menahem.
as a Fountain, continually, and plentifully) speech, yet without sound; by a
dumb kind of eloquence, eructant; by a continual revolution and success of days
men are instructed concerning the Power and Providence of God, as also
concerning his truth and faithfulness; for if God has hitherto kept promise
with Nights and Days, that one shall succeed the other; will he not much more
keep promise with his people? Jer. 33.20, 25.

And Night unto Night shows knowledge] Days and Nights by their perpetual
course and order, Dei potentiam and sapientiam concelebrant; there being no
less necessity of the Night in its kind, than of the Day. The knowledge it
shows us, is, that man in himself is weak, and cannot long hold out hard
labor; that he is permitted to sleep a while, and take his rest; that he must
abridge himself of some part of his rest to commune with his own heart on his
bed, and be still; that if he bestir not himself, and do up his work quickly,
the Night of Death comes, when no man can work, etc.

Verse. 3. There is no speech, nor language, where their voyce] And yet few hear
these Catholic Preachers, these Regii Professores, these real Postilles of
the Divinity, as one styles them, who do preach to all people at once, Non
solum diserte sed and exerte, at surdis plerumque fabulam, they are by the most
as little respected as is the Cuckoe in June.

Verse. 4. Their line is gone out through all the earth] Or, their rule, or
direction, or delineation, or Scripture (confer Isa. 28.13.) Quod in coelis
tanquam in volumine omnibus conspicuo descript a sit Dei gloria, because that
in the Heavens, as in an open Book, (...)
is written down the glory of the Creator. The like is done also in other less
considerable Creatures: every of which do after a sort write as well as speak,
and have a Pen as well as a Tongue. The Chaldee word for a Mint signifies also
a Book of Histories, because in that one Herb large stories of Gods Wisdom,
Might, and Love are described unto us. The same word also that signifies an
ear of Corn, signifies a word, because every Field of Corn is a Book of Gods
praise, every Land a Leaf, (...)
every Sheaf a Verse, every Ear a word, every Corn of Wheat a Letter, to
express the glory of God by. Praesentem narrat quaelibet herba Deum. Antony the
Eremite being asked by a certain Philosopher, how he could contemplate high
things, having no help of Books? answered, That the whole World was to him
instead of a well-furnished Library, this he had ready by him at all times and
in all places, Aug. de doct, Christ. l. 1. Niceph. l: 8: c: 40: In vita Bern.
and in this he could read when he pleased the great things of God. Bernard
also says, that the time was when he had no other Masters nisi quercus and
fagos, but the Oaks and Beech-trees.

In them has he set a Tabernacle for the Sun] That Prince of Planets, but
servant to the Saints of the most High, as his name imports; so sweet a
Creature he is, that Eudoxus the Philosopher professed, that he would be
content to be burnt up by the heat of it, so he might be admitted to come so
near it as to learn the nature of it. A Tabernacle, or slitting-tent it is here
said to have in the Heavens: because it never stays in one place, but
courseth about with incredible swiftness.

Verse. 5. Which is as a Bridegroom coming out of his Chamber] sc. after long
expectation, with a great deal of pomp and gayety; such is the Sunrising, when
he first she weth himself above our Horizon. Kimchi adds, that as the
Bridegroom when he is abroad hasteneth home to his Bride, so does the Sun to
his descent, anhe'at ad occasum, Eccles. 1.5.

And rejoices as a strong man (or Champion) to run a race] readily running,
and effectually affecting all things with his heat. The Persian Angari or
Posts, the Ostrich, the wild Ass, the Bustard, the Dromedary, De ascensmentis
in Deum, grad. 7
the Eagle is nothing so swift as the Sun. Bellarmine says, that he runs in
the eighth part of an hour seven thousand miles. This dumb Creature gives check
to our dullness; as Balaams Ass also did to that Prophets madness.

Verse. 6. H^^ going forth is from the end of the heaven] i. e. from the East
unto the West, in which course notwithstanding, while he compasses the circle
of Heaven and Earth, he visits the South and the North, and is unweariable.

And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof] i.e. from the benefit of the
Suns heat, who is ut cor incorpore, as the heart in the body, says Aben-Ezra:
all things feel the quickening heat of the Sun; not only the roots of Trees,
Plants, etc. but Metals, and Minerals in the bowels of the earth.

Verse. 7. The Law of the Lord is perfect] Or, Doctrine: the whole Word of God,
commonly distinguished into Law and Gospel, is perfect immaculate, sincere,
entire, complete. It Tully durst say, that the Law of the twelve Tables in Rome
did exceed all the Libraries of Philosophers, both in weight of authority, and
fruit-fulness of matter, how much rather is this true of Gods Law, says a
Learned Writer? Nothing may be added to it without marring of it, Prove. 30.6.
Note this against Jewish, Popish, and Turkish Traditions, and additions; as
also against Antiscripturists, and Anabaptists, who at first rejected all Books
but the Bible; and after that grew so wise as to be religious enough without
that also. And last of all, they came to blaspheme that blessed Book, as a dead
Letter, and a beggarly Element, etc. when as the Apostle tells us, that all
Scripture is pure, precious, and profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, etc. that
the Man of God may be perfect, etc. 2 Timothy 3.16, 17. Here in this, and the two
following Verses, it is easy to observe; ^. That every of them are in the
Hebrew written with ten words. 2. That here is a Six-fold commendation of Gods
holy Word. 1. By the several names thereunto given, Law, Testimony, Statutes,
etc. 2. By the Nature, perfect, sure, right etc. 3. By the effects, converting
the soul, making wise the simple, etc.

Converting the Soul] This no Doctrine besides can do. Plato went thrice to
Sicily to convert Dionysius the Tyrant, but could not. Ambrose says well of
Polemo, Integra est Doctrina, ac proinde animo^ redintegrat. Jun. De Elia and
jejunio cap. 12
who of a Drunkard, by hearing Xenocrates, became a Philosopher, Si resipuit a
vino, fuit semper tamen temulentus sacrilegio, if he gave over his Drunkenness,
yet he continued still drunk with superstition. Seneca the Philosopher wrote a
Book (now lost) against superstitions, but yet lived and died in them; Colebat
quod reprehendebat, agebat quod arguebat, quod culpabat adorabat, says Austin
of him, he exercised what he condemned, and would not leave what he did so
utterly dislike. But the Word works a transmentation, an entire change of the
mind, and manners, a new Creation, 2 Cor. 5.17.

The testimony of the Lord is sure] These words are faithful and true, Rev.
22.6. they are all in righteousness, neither is there in them any thing
perverse or froward, Prove. 8.8. Testimonies they are called, 1. Because they
testify (as a Record) to all Ages what the will of the Lord is, Joh. 5.39. 2.
They were given with great contestation, and pressing of all men to keep them.
3. They will be a witness against all such as do not. The Gospel also is called
a Testimony, 1 Cor. 2.1. 2 These. 1.10. Isa. 18.20.

Making wise the simple] That is, the humble, teachable, and such as are not
puffed up with a conceit of their own wisdom, 1 Cor. 7.18. the very entrance
into Gods word gives light, it gives understanding to the simple, or to the
perswadable, Psalm. 119.130. It is reasonable milk, 1 Pet. 2.2.

Verse. 8. The statutes of the Lord are right] As being the issue of the most
righteous will of God. Of humane laws Demosthenes says, that they are (...),
the invention of the Gods. Much better may we say the like of this law here
commended: Right it is, because it teaches men the right way to life, non
flexuosum quale docet care and cautio humana; Right also, because it speaks
right to every man's case and condition; de quolibet in re sua, affording a
salve for every sore, a medicine for every malady; so that it may better be
called than was that famous library at Alexandria, (...) Physic for the soul,
food and Physic both, and of the best sort, the best of the best.

Rejoicing the heart] This is the proper work of the Gospel; the sweet promises
whereof hid in the heart, and there mingled with faith, make it to over-abound
exceedingly with joy, and to conceive strong consolation; the Martyrs of all
ages ges for instance. And although it be the Doctrine of the Cross, yet
Le^ythos babet in malis, it has cordialls of comfort, such as the World can
neither give, nor take away: the Gospel is a precious book; every leaf drops
myrrh a^^ mercy. We should therefore prize it much more than Caesar did his
Commentaries; Major fuit cura Caesari libellorum quam purpurae; for swimming
through the waters to escape his enemies, he carried his books in his hand
above the waters, but lost his robe. Now what were his books to Gods?

The Commandment of the Lord is pure] And so differs from humane laws,
which establishes wickedness sometimes; as those of Lycurgus did some kind of
theft, adultery, etc. Humane Doctrines also are mixed with many errors. Irenaus
justly taxes Plato for this that he did lacte gypsum miscere, mingle lime
with milk, stain the pure stream of divine truth with fabulous narrations and
fopperies. But every word of God is pure, Psalm 12.7. and 18.32. See the Notes.

Inlightening the eyes] Giving both light and sight, Act. 26.18. the saving
knowledge of God and his will, of our selves, and of our duties; and bringing
us out of darkness into his mavelous light, 1 Pet. 2.9. When Christ came
preaching, the people which sat in darkness saw a great light, Mat. 4.16. And
we have a more sure light of prophecy, whereunto we must take heed as unto a
light that shines in a dark place, 2 Pet. 1.19. Whilst the Moon looks
directly upon the Sun, she is bright and beautiful; but if she once turn
aside, and be left to her self, she loses all Her glory, and enjoys but only
a shadow of light, which is her own: So whilst men with humility and
teachablenesse turn their faces toward Christ revealed in the Gospel, and those
stars in his right hand, the faithful Ministers, to receive illumination and
instruction; God does graciously vouchsafe unto them the glorious light of
saving knowledge. But when they turn their backs upon him and his Oracles, and
will needs walk by the light of their own tinder-boxes, kindling a fire, and
compassing themselves with sparks, Isa. 50.11. they are sure to be bewildred,
and to lie down in sorrow.

Verse. 9. The fear of the Lord is clean] That is. The Doctrine which teaches
the true fear of God, is such as cleanses the conscience, ferreteth out
corruption, sanctifies the whole man, Joh. 17.17. and 15.3. Act. 20.32. and
26.18.

Enduring for evor] For ever, O Lord thy word is established in Heaven, Psalm.
119.89. Heaven and Earth shall pass, but not one jot or tittle of the law; not
one hair of that sacred head shall fall to the ground, Mat. 5.18. should all
the powers on earth make war against the very paper of the Scriptures, they
cannot possibly destroy it. What God has written, he has written, and it
shall stand inviolable to the Worlds end. Antiochus Epiphanes, Dioclesian, and
other Tyrants have attempted to burn up all Bibles: but could never effect it.
Other laws, and Religions are antiquated and altered, as all Histories
testify; not so this.

The Judgments of the Lord are true] Heb. Truth, as coming from a God of
Truth, and without iniquity, just, and righteous is he, Deuteronomy. 32.4. All his
sayings are faithful, and therefore worthy of all acceptance. 1 Timothy 1.15.
The Eternity of Israel cannot lie, 1 Samuel 15.29. He will not suffer his
faithfulness to fail, nor alter the thing that is gone out of his mouth,
Psalm. 89.33. (...) says Plato; Truth is lasting, and (...), Truth is sweet,
said Mercuries Priests when they are their figs. Divine Truths should be so to
us, in a special manner. And as Cyprian, in any great doubt or difficulty
would call to Paulus Concordiensis (who was his notary) for Tertullians works
saying, Da Magistrum, Reach hither my Master; so should we call for the Bible,
and there-hence fetch satisfaction, and settlement, as holding it infallible.

And righteous altogether] Not one of them to be found fault with; but all of
them every way complete and absolute. Justificata sunt simul, so some render
it, they are altogether justified. What an high esteem the Jews at this day
have of the Law, has been elsewhere noted; whilst they carry it usually about
their Synagogues at the end of their service in procession, with many ornaments
of Crowns and Scepters; the Children kissing it, as it passes by them. Spec.
Euro^
To their Disciples they prescribe, not to write any letter of the law without
a copy, no line of it without a rule, no parchment but made of the skin of a

but lay it next to his heart in his travel; nor read it, but in a clean
place; nor sell it, though the copy were moth-eaten, and himself half
famished. The last day of the feast of Tabernacles they call Shimchah Torah,
the rejoicing at the Law. They have chosen also then, two, that are called
sponsi legis; one of which is to read the end of it called Chathan Torah, the
Bridegroom of the Law ended; the other Chathan Bereshith, Leo Moden of Jew.

because he presently begins it again; these are to express joy.

Verse. 10. More to be desired are they than gold] Old people are all for
profit, young for pleasure; here is gold for the one, yea the finest gold (gold
of Fes) in great quantity; here is honey for the other, yea live-hony dropping
from the comb, Acaeto melle^ Plin. l. 11. c. ^
liquor of the honeycomb. As Manna had all sorts of sweet tastes in it; so has
the word, to those that have spiritual senses exercised to discern good and
evil. Great is the sweetness of humane learning to those that have got a
taste of it, as it was to Pythagoras and Plato, who traveled far for it; to
Julian the Apostate, who preferred the study of it, before all pastimes
whatsoever; to M. Aurelius the Emperor, who said he would not leave the
knowledge he might learn in one hour, for all the gold that he possessed; to
Alphonsus King of Arragon, who preferred his skill in the Mathematics, before
the Empire of Germany when it was offered unto him; he professed, that he had
rather lose his Jewels than his books; and all his Kingdoms rather than that
little learning he had attained unto. How then should we prize divine
learning, which is infinitely more precious, profitable, and pleasant? David
had much of it, and yet he cries to God ever and anon, Teach me thy statutes.
Moses was but newly come down from the Mount, and he presently prays as one
insatiate, Lord show me thy glory. The Angels themselves know not so much of
the mystery of Christ, but they would fain know more, 1 Pet. 1.12. Ephesians. 3.10.
etc.

Verse. 11. Moreover by them is thy servant warned] Clearly admonished, or
fourbished and brightned, Dan. 12.3. made circumspect. Gods Testimonies were
David's counselors, Psalm. 119.24. better than ever was Polybius to Scipio,
Agrippa to Augustus, Seneca to Nero, Anaxagoras to Themistocles, Plato to Dio,
Alexander to Aristotle, or Nigidius to Cicero; Princes of old, had their (...)
Monitores, Remembrancers. David desired no better than Gods statutes for his
learned counsel, and by them he resolved to be ruled; for so it follows,

And in keeping of them] Zenophon writes that in Lycurgus his laws this was
much to be admired, that whereas all men commended them, yet no other City
besides that of Sparta, would ever observe them. Men do rather praise right
things than practice them; as it was said of Demosthenes. But David was of
another strain; he, after a large encomium of Gods Commandments, is set upon
the keeping of them; and the rather, because

In keeping of them there is great reward] Not only for keeping, but in keeping
of them. As every Flower has its sweet smell; so every good action has its
sweet reflection upon the soul: and as Cardan says, that every precious Stone
has some egregious virtue; so here, Righteousness is its own reward, though
few men think so, and act accordingly: Haud facile invenies multis e millibus
unum,
Virtutem pretium qui putet esse sui.


Howbeit, the chief reward is not till the last cast, till we come to Heaven.
Gnekeb^ (...) (...) apu^ Graeco^.
The word here rendered reward, signifies the heel, and by a Metaphor, the end
of a work, and the reward of it, which is not till the end. Sicut opus non est
usque ad mertem perfectum, sic nec merces, says R. David here; As the work is
not done till death; so neither is full wages till then to be had.

Verse. 12. Who can understand his error?] This David speaks doubtless out of
a deep sense of his own imperfections, and defects in what the Law (so much by
him commended) requires; and to prevent mistakes, lest any man hearing him
speak of great reward, should think that Heaven may be merited, and Salvation
attained by a man's own righteousness. No such matter, believe it, says holy
David, I have neither done the Law, nor deserved the reward, but do fly to God
by prayer; and three things I have to beg of him; First, that he would
graciously pardon my secret sins and errors, unknown to my self, or at least
to others. Secondly, That he would keep me from proud and presumtuous sins,
verse. 13. Thirdly, That he would bridle my tongue and mind from speaking, or
but thinking ought that may be offensive to his Majesty, verse. 14. For the
First of these, Jun.
Humanum est errare and ignorare errorem suum; It is incident to every man to
err, and then to be ignorant of his errors. Certain it is, that our lives are
fuller of sins, than the Firmament is of Stars, or the Furnace of sparks. And
if the best man's faults were written in his forehead, it would make him pull
his hat over his eyes, as the Proverb has it. David here sees such volumes of
corruptions in his heart, and so many foul Errataes in his life, that he cannot
but cry out, Who can understand, etc. O cleanse, etc. The most perfect Saints
are the most sensible of their imperfections; as the more delicate the Senses
are, the more sharply are they affected with what offends them, Romans 7.14. 1
Cor. 15.9, 10. Alas for us! (says one good man) Ipsa lachrymae sunt
lachrymabiles; we had need to weep over our tears, sigh over our sobs, mourn
over our griefs, etc. Look how when we have swept a room never so clean (says
Spinaeus) if the Sun do but come into it at the windows, De instit, Christian.
we soon espy abundance of filthy motes, mingled with the beams thereof: so is
it with our hearts, when once illightned. What a blind buzzard then was he
that said, Non habeo Domine quod mihi ignoscas, Lord, I have nothing for thee
to pardon? And no wiser was Bellarmine that great Scholar, but ill read in his
own heart, if that be true that is reported of him, viz. that when the Priest
came to absolve him, he could not remember any particular sin to confess, till
he went back in his thoughts as far as his youth. Of Philip the Third King of
Spain, Val. Max. Christ. 263.
it is said, that he lived so strictly, that he never committed any gross
Crime, or wilful wickedness; yet coming to dye, he cried out, O that I had
never reigned! O that I had lived a private life in the Wilderness, that I
might not have now to answer for not doing the good, or hindering the evil that
I might have done in my government!

Cleanse thou me from secret faults] Secret from my self, many of them (sins of
ignorance and of inadvertency) secret from the world, more of them, heart sins,
but not secret from the Lord, Psalm. 90.8. Heb. 4.13. These are of daily and
hourly incursion, involuntary and unavoydable infirmities, yet are they sins
properly so called; and we must be cleansed from them by the Merit and Spirit
of Christ: they must be repented of in general at least; and then there is a
pardon of course for them, and they do not usually distract and plunge the
Conscience.

Verse. 13. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins] Heb. Withdraw,
inhibit, for we are naturally prone to the worst of sins, even the best of us,
and to lie buried with the World in a bog of wickedness, adding rebellion to
sin, and doing wickedly with both hands earnestly, unless God reign us in, and
restrain us from such enormities. Midrash Tillin. in Psalm. 191.
Pray we therefore as here, Etiam a superbiis contine servum tuum. David's
Murdering Vriah was a sin of this sort. The Rabbis here observe how the
Propher rises in his request, first for pardon of lesser sins, and then for
power against greater; like as a Beggar, say they, first craves a little water,
and then a Morsel of bread. We should do so.

Let them not have dominion over me] Sin will rebel, but it must not reign in
our mortal bodies, it must not play Rex, and bear sway in the soul. Pray hard
against that in chief, Ne iniquit as victrix dominetur, that our lusts be not
our Lords, that vice vanquish us not.

Then shall I be upright] Then, when I have gotten both pardoning and
prevailing-grace, to be cleansed from infirmities, and kept from presumptions
and arrogancies, which cum temerario ausu and fastu fiunt contumaciter, I shall
be upright in Gods account, and entire in his obedience.

And I shall be innocent from the great transgression] That sin unto death, 1
John 5. 16. that wickedness with a witness, for which there remains no more
sacrifice, Heb. 10.26. and unto which a way is paved by sins of presumption
with an high hand committed against knowledge and conscience.

Verse. 14. Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations, etc.] Sint ad
beneplacitum verba, etc. Let both my words and thoughts, as well as my life and
actions, be to favorable acceptance; let them be such as may suit with thy
law and will. Midrash (...) lin.


O Lord my strength] Heb. My Rock. In Mare, velin Marah, velin hoc mundo say
the Rabbines; In the Sea of sorrow, and all along the Wilderness of this World.

And my Redeemer] Or, My near-kinsman, who is Jesus Christ, in whom we may look
for all good from God, by virtue of the Covenant. This David well understood,
and therefore he lays all the weight on this, O Lord my strength and my
Redeemer.

PSALM. XX.
A Psalm of David] Or, Concerning David; so Kimchi. Or for and on the behalf of
David; so Aben-Ezra. David, as a Prophet, dictated this form of prayer to be
made by the people for himself, their King; when he went forth to fight their
battles, probably, against the Ammonites and Syrians; or when he fled from
Absalom, and was to help them from the City, by his prayers, 2 Samuel 18.3. as
Aben-Ezra thinks.

Verse. 1. The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble] Great men, though gracious,
as David, have their distresses, and must pray for themselves then; not
trusting to the prayers of others for them; as did that profane Earl of
Westmorland, Camden.
who said, that he had no need to pray, since he had Tenants enough to pray
for him.

The name of the God of Jacob defend thee] Heb. set thee in an high place, such
as Gods name is, Prove. 18.10. the righteous run thereto and are safe, as in a
Tower of brass, or Town of war. By the name of God is meant, Deus
nominatissimus, the most renowned God. says Junius, and worthy to be praised,
as Psalm. 18.3. And he is called the God of Jacob here, says Another; first,
because Jacob was once in the like distress, Genesis 32.6, 7. secondly, because
he prayed to the like purpose, Genesis 35.3. thirdly, because he prevailed with
God as a Prince; and there God spoke with us, Hos. 12.5. fourthly, because God
of Jacob is the same with God of Israel; and so the Covenant is pleaded.

Verse. 2. Send thee help from the Sanctuarie] Or, From his holy heaven, says
Tremellius; without which vain is the help of man. God is all the Dooer in
battles; and whencesoever the sword comes, it is bathed in Heaven, Isa. 34.5.
whatsoever Ajax, Timotheus Atheniensis, and other Atheists think to the
contrary. God will send from Heaven and save me says holy David.

And strengthen thee out of Sion] i. e. Out of the Assemblies of the Saints,
where they are praying hard for thy welfare, See Psalm. 76.2, 3. with the Note.

Verse. 3. Remember all thine offerines] Before they went to war, they were wont
to offer sacrifices, as did Saul; though by his over-haste therein he lost his
Kingdom, 1 Samuel 13.9. From the people of God, the Heathens also had learned
this course and custom. Io Paean is in force Jehovah Peneh, that is, Lord look
upon us. The Devil (Gods ape) had taught the Athenians, when they began the
battle, to use these words, and thereby to hearten one another. The Romans also
did the like; and would not desist till they had an auspicious answer; hence
also they called a sacrifice hostiam, because, when they went against their
enemies, they offered it.

And accept thy burnt sacrifice] Or, turn it to ashes (and so seal up his
acceptance) or, make it fat, i. e. take delight in it, as men do in fat things
full of marrow, says R. Solomon.

Selah] This is added, to show, says Vatablus, with how great fervency the
people ought to pray for their King.

Verse. 4. Grant thee according to thine own heart] David's heart was according
to Godsheart (otherwise this had not been a warrantable Petition) and therefore
might say (and the people on his behalf) as once Luther did, Fiat voluntas mea;
mea Domine quiatua, Let my will be done; mine I say, Lord, because the same
with thine.

And fulfill all thy counsel] Answer thee, ad cardinem desiderii, as a Father
expresses it; Aug. Confess. li. 5. c. 8.
Let it be unto thee even as thou will. Sometimes God does not only grant a
man's prayer, but fulfilleth his counsel; that is, in that very way, by that
very means, which his judgment pitched upon in his thoughts.

Verse. 5. We will rejoice in thy salvation] i. e. We are well assured that God
will save us by thee, O King; and that shall produce a general joy amongst us.
This confidence Prayer had begotten in them: for it is a sure grain; and if men
would sow more of it in Gods bosom, they should not fail to reap the fruit and
comfort of it in their greatest need. Pray, that your joy may be full.

And in the name of our God will we set up our Banners] Our Flaggs of defiance
to the enemy; or our tokens of triumph to Gods glory, who has given us the
Victory. The Romans when they had conquered an enemy, rode in triumph to the
Capitol, where in all humility they presented a Palm, or Laurel-bush, to
Jupiter.

Verse. 6. Now know I that. etc.] This is Vox populi; I, that is All we; but
they speak as if they had been all one, and had uttered it all with one mouth;
such was their unity, and concent in prayer. Or, it is sermo uniuscujusque in
Israele, as Kimchi will have it, the triumph of their trust.

He will hear him from his holy heaven, etc.] He will hear him: he will do for
him; Haec due sunt documenta, says Junius: by these two ways (besides the
Word) the Church comes to know the grace and good will of her God.

Verse. 7. Some trust in Chariots, etc.] i.e. in their National accommodations
and military provisions; but these were never true to those that trusted them.
All is but an arm of flesh.

But we will remember, etc.] i. e. in the remembrance of his excellent
Attributes, whereof we have had such proof, we will take courage.

Verse. 8. They are brought down, etc.] They lyc flat by the fall they have
taken, being confuted in their confidences, as Benhadad was of old: as a late,
the French at the Battle of Agincourt: Sigismund the young King of Hungary, and
many others.

But we are risen] Who before seemed to lie along, Et tanquam sideratos humi
serpere. God helps his when forsaken of their hopes almost.

Verse. 9. Save Lord] A short but pithy prayer: Quam multa quam paucis.

Let the King hear us] They beg of God that the King may hear them, so, as to
govern and defend them in equity and tranquillity; or, Respondeat Rex (so
Aben-Ezra reads it) Let the King say, Amen, to our prayers to thee, and our
requests to him.

PSALM. XXI.
Verse. 1. The King shall joy in thy strength] This Psalm depends upon the
former; and is therefore fitly set next unto it. Some call it David's Triumphant
Song of praise, for victory gotten over the Ammonites and Syrians. For that
Victory it was certainly, which he and the people had begged so fervently,
Psalm. 20. and promised solemnly to rejoice in Gods Salvation, etc. verse. 5. as
here is done accordingly. Vow and perform unto the Lord your God: bring
presents, etc. Psalm. 76.11.

And in thy salvation] All is Gods. As Joab once sent to David to come, and
take the honor of the Victory over Rabbah of the Ammonites: so deals David
by the Lord. His Posie was, Non nobis Domine; his practice was to drive an holy
trade between Earth and Heaven, receiving and returning, importing one
commodity, and transporting another: Prayers and Praises were his whole life*

Verse. 2. Thom have given him his hearts desire] Good m^n are sure to have out
their prayers either in money, or in moneys worth, as they say; in that very
thing they desire, or a better. If God cross them, it is in faithfulness to
their Souls: when the wicked boasts of his hearts desire, Psalm. 10.3. which
yet he has for a mischief. Deus saepe dat iratus, quod neg at propitius. See
the Note on Psalm. 20.4.

And has not withheld, etc. Selah] Ac si dicat, O magnam and admirabilem
Dei benevolentiam erga Davidem! says Vatablus. This Selah is added here, to
set forth the very great and wonderful love of God to David, in hearing his
Suits after that sort.

Verse. 3. For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness] Not staying
till he asked them of thee. He had but a thought of building thee an house, and
thou sentest Nathan to tell him, that thou would build him an everlasting
house, and stablish his Throne to all perpetuity, 2 Samuel 7.16. So Isa. 65.1.
Before they call, I will answer, etc.

Thou set a Crown of pure gold upon his head] Hebrai dicunt per hoc
intelligi favorem Dei, the Jew-Doctors by this Crown understand the favor of
God; confer Psalm. 103.4. God had set a Crown of loving kindness, and tender
mercies upon his head, by pardoning all his iniquities, as it is there; and he
blesses God for this as a far better Crown, than that which he took from off
the head of the King of Ammon, and set upon his own, 2 Samuel 12.30.

Verse. 4. He asked life of thee] Quando fugiebat a Saul, says R. Solomon,
when he fled from Saul; rather when he went into the field against his enemies,
carrying his life in his hand. His life we begged, Psalm. 20.1, 2. and thou have
not only given him his life, but a long continued series of lives in his
Successors, 2 Samuel 7.13. Psalm. 72.15. yea life everlasting in Christ his Son,
according to the flesh. See Psalm. 61.6. Thus God is better to his people than
their prayers; and when they ask but one Blessing, he answers them as Naaman
did Gehezi, with Nay take two. Hezekiah asked but one life, and God gave him
fifteen years, which we reckon at two lives, and more. He gives liberally, and
like himself; as Great Alexander did when he gave the poor Beggar a City; and
when he sent his Schoolmaster a ship full of Frankincense, and bade him
sacrifice freely.

Verse. 5. His glory is great in thy salvation] He was at first slighted even by
his own, as a petty Prince; and the Philistines came up to seek him, that they
might suppress him, before he grew too strong for them; in so much as he for
fear of them went down to the Hold, 2 Samuel 5.17. but soon after he became
formidable to them, and the rest of the neighbour-Nations, whom he subdued, and
reigned over. The like hereunto befell our Queen Elizabeth, who how low soever
at first, became at length, as her enemies confessed, the most glorious Woman
that ever swayed Scepter, because Posuit Deum adjutorem suum.

Honor and Majesty have thou laid upon him] a growing weight of glory, a load
of it, even before man. The Saints when they come to Heaven shall have an
exceeding excessive eternal weight of glory, 2 Cor. 4.17. such as if the body
were not upheld by the mighty Power of God, it were impossible it should ever
bear it.

Verse. 6. For thou have made him most blessed for ever] Heb. Thou have set him
to be blessings. For as the wicked, when destroyed by some horrible Judgment,
are examples to others of Gods curse, Isa. 65.15. Jer. 29.22. 2 Pet. 2.6.
Judaeus sim, si fallam, say the Turks at this day, when they would assure any
thing for a certainty; so the godly when in a special manner blessed, are
Patterns of blessings to others, that in them they may bless themselves or
others, Psalm. 72.17. Psalm. 1*28. 4. Genesis 12.2. and 48.20. Ruth 4.11, 12. See
Psalm. 37.26. So here they shall say, Tanto rerum successu polleas, quanto
David, May thou be as successful as ever David was.

Thou have made him exceeding glad with thy countenance] One good cast whereof
David long since preferred before all the worlds good, Psalm. 4.6. See the Note
there.

Verse. 7. For the King trusts in the Lord] So then, his joy was the joy of
faith which is unspeakable and full of glory; and he must needs be safe who
relyeth upon God, Isa. 26.4.

He shall not be moved] sc. from the prosperous success of his affairs and
state; the beauty and bulwark whereof is Gods never failing mercy.

Verse. 8. Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies] Thine, because ours; for
thou art in a league with us both defensive and offensive: Now our enemies act
as if they were out of the reach of thy rod, but thou will easily hunt them
down, and root them out. Pursued they shall be by thee, and overtaken, run
they never so far, never so fast.

(...). Verse. 9. Thou shall make them as a fiery Oven] i.e. Thou shall lay upon
them grievous and exquisite miseries, Lam. 5.10. He alludeth to the overthrow
of Sodom, says Vatablus.

The Lord shall swallow them up] As the fire does the fuel. Some think the
Prophet here alludeth to that direful kind of punishment which David inflicted
upon the Ammonites whom he made to pass through the brick-kiln, 2 Samuel 12.31.
perhaps the furnace of their Idol Moloch or Milcholm, wherein they caused their
Children to pass through the fire, 2 King. 16.3. and 23.10.

And the fire shall devour them] Hellfire, says the Chaldee Paraphrast.

Verse. 10. Nulla emolumenta laborum Juven.
Their fruit shall thou destroy] i.e. Their labor, and that which comes
thereof, Prove. 21.16, 31. they shall toil to no purpose; the gains shall not
pay for the pains.

And their seed] For as personal goodness is profitable to posterity; so on
the contrary; as, in the second Commandment: they are peremptores potius quam
Parents. Bern.


Verse. 11. For they intended evil against thee] Because against thy people.
He that wrongeth a subject is arraigned for injury done to the King, his Crown
and dignity. And as a certain Gentleman of Normandy was executed for but
intending only to kill Francis the second King of France, which he discovered
to a Priest, sub sigillo confessionis, not thinking ever to hear further of it
again; so here.

Verse. 12. Therefore shall thou make them turn their back] Who faced the very
Heavens, and ran, as it were, full butt against thee; such was their impudence
and insolence. But thy wrath shall so meet them in the teeth, wheresoever they
turn, that they shall be forced to give over their chase and pursuit of thy
people. Thou shall make them turn their back, Heb. their shoulder; whence some
sense the words thus, Thou shall bind them back to back, and cast them into the
Sea of perdition. Some read the words thus, Pones eos ut meram. Kimchi
Thou shall set them as a Butt or Mark to shoot at; and this agrees best with
that which follows.

Against the face of them] Which is elegantly campared to the white; as their
bodies to the whole mark or Butt.

Verse. 13. Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength] Finit Psalmum cum
laud, sicut incaepit, says Aben-Ezra, He closes up the Psalm, as he began
it, with praise and prayer that God would arise and destroy therest, as he had
already done some of their enemies. Gods power and strength is in it self
infinite, and cannot be exalted or amplified; but in respect of us it is said
to be exalted, when exerted and put forth for the defense of his people.

So will we sing and praise thy power] This they restipulate; as knowing that
it would please the Lord better than an Ox or Bullock that has horns and
hoofs, Psalm. 69.31.

PSALM. XXII.
UPon Ajeleth Shahar] Or, The morning-Hart or stag; such an one as the huntsman
severeth out in the morning from the rest, to hunt for that day. It shows,
says One, David's and Christ's early and uncessant persecution and hunting (by
those dogs, verse. 16.) till they came to their Kingdoms. David had his share
of sharp afflictions, doubtless, when he penned this Psalm; witness that
graphicall description of his greatest grief in all parts and powers of body
and soul, Verse. 14, 15, 16; etc. But his mind and thoughts were by Gods holy
Spirit carried out to Christ's most dolorous and inexpressible sufferings; to
the which all his were but as flea-bitings, as the slivers or chips of Christ's
Cross; and this was no small mitigation of his misery. When the Jews offered
our Savior gall and vinegar, he tasted it, but would not drink. Therest he
left for his people, and they must pledge him, filling up that which is behind
of his sufferings, Col. 1.24. though for a different end, as for exercise,
example, trial, witness of truth, etc.

Verse. 1. My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me?] David had prayed, Oh for
sake me not utterly, Psalm. 119.8. In part and for a time he knew God might
forsake him, to his thinking at least. But what says Austin? Non deserit Deus
etiamsi deserere videatur; non deserit etiamsi deserat; God forsakes not his,
though he leem sometimes to do so; he leaves them sometimes, but forsakes
them never: as in an eclipse, the earth wants the light of the Sun, but not
the influence thereof. David could at the same time call God, his God thrice
over, which are words of faith, and do plainly evince that this desertion under
which he groaned, was neither absolute nor real, but only that he was in a
great distress and perplexity; Plat. in Phaed
so that he did believe, and yet not believe ( Plato though a Heathen could
say that a man may do so.) See the like, Psalm. 31.22. Jon. 2.4. See the Note
there. Our Savior in his deepest distress on the Cross, when coping and
conflicting with the wrath of his heavenly Father, who (beside the wrath of
men, and rage of Devils in that three hours darkness especially) fought
against him with his own bare hand, he suffered more than can be imagined,
took up this patheticall exclamation, and as some think, repeated this whole
Psalm. Then it was that he felt in soul and body the horror of Gods
displeasure against sin, for which he had undertaken. Then it was that the
Deity (though never separated from his Humanity, no not in death when soul and
body were sundred for a season) did (...) (as a Father speaks) suspend for
time the influence of its power, and lie hid as it were, neque vires suas
exserebat, not putting forth its force, as formerly. Hilary has a good Note
upon this part of Christ's passion; Habes conquerentem relictum se esse, etc.
Here thou have him complaining as forsaken of God; this shows him to have
been a man; but withal thou have him promising paradise to the penitent thief;
this speaks him God.

Why art thou so far from, etc.] I roar and am not relieved, as to ease; God
will have his people feel what an evil and bitter thing sin is, Jer. 2.19. and
therefore he holds them eftsoons long upon the rack. Christ also, under the
deep sense of our sins, for which he suffered, offered up prayers, with strong
crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, Heb. 5.7.

Verse. 2. O my God, I cry in the day time, etc.] This was a sore temptation,
that his heartiest prayers were not heard. This might have made him jealous of
God; to have had hard conceits of him, and heavy conceits of himself. But says
he in the following verses, Thou art holy, and thy Name is to be sanctified,
though I be not gratified. And moreover, Others have called upon thee and have
been heard, verse. 4, 5. though I now for mine unworthiness am denied. For I am
a worm, and no man, Verse. 6. Thus it puts him not off that he is not heard, as
others; but humbles him. It drives him not, (as is usual with carnal people
in like case) to shifting courses, as a dog that has lost his Master will
follow after any one for relief. A Christian never prevails so little by his
prayers, but that he will take heart of grace, to come again to God. Silence,
or sad answers, do not utterly dishearten him. He cease not wrestling till
he has wrested the blessing out of Gods hand with Jacob; and gotten matter of
praise for his prayers granted, as David here does, ere he had done the Psalm,
verse. 24, 25.

Verse. 3. But thou art holy] And therefore to be sanctified in righteousness,
Isa. 5.16. whatever betide me or my prayers. I also will trust and try thee to
the uttermost, for thou waitest to be gracious; and being a God of Judgment
thou best understandest when and how to dispense and deal forth thy favors to
thy suppliants, Isa. 30.18. And if I ask good things of thee and miss, it is
because I ask amiss, Jam. 4.3. If I be straightened, it is not in thee, but in
mine own bowels. They that have Conduit-water come into their houses, if no
water come, they conclude not the spring to be dry, but the pipes to be
stopped or broken. If prayer speed not, we must be sure the fault is not in
God, but in our selves; were we but ripe for mercy, he is ready to extend it
to us, and even waits for the purpose.

O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel] i.e. The Sanctuary where thou
art continually praised by thine Israel, who have the happiness to receive
thine answer to their suits, though I cannot. Some render it, O sancte,
sempiterne, and laudatissime.

Verse. 4. Our Fathers trusted in thee] They trusted, and trusted, and trusted,
they lengthened out their trust. The Hebrew word for Hope or Trust signifies
also a line; because thereby the heart is stretched out as a line to the thing
hoped for; and he that believes, makes not haste.

And thou did deliver them] Never could any instance be given to the
contrary. Let the success of our forefathers confidence, and hope unfailable,
flowing from faith unfeigned, confirm our fiduciall dependence upon
Gospel-promises.

Verse. 5. They cried unto thee] Having first trusted; It is the prayer of faith
that does the deed.

And were not confounded] Deo confisi, nunquam confusi.

Verse. 6. But I am a worm, and no man] David (says a learned man) in the
Arabic tongue signifies a worm; to which he may here seem to allude. I am a
worm says He, I am dust and ashes says Abraham, less than the lest of thy
loving kindnesses, says Jacob. Nos autem quid sumus? says Moses. Thus the
Saints express themselves in a low language, as so many broken men. Contrarily
the wicked speak big words, bubbles of words, as Peter has it; ampullantur, as
Pharaoh, who said, Who is the Lord? Nebuchadnezzar, Who is that God that can
deliver you? Dan. 3. who is Lord over us? etc. Psalm. 12. Our Lord Christ, of
whom the greatest part of this Psalm must be understood, emptied and humbled
himself to the utmost, Phil. 2.7, 8. that we might be exalted; this San of
Righteousness went ten degrees back. in the Dial of his Father, that he might
come unto us with health in his wings, etc.

A Reproach of men] Rejectamentum hominis, and nullificamen populi, as
Tertullian phraseth it. So was Christ, Isa. 53. so were his Apostle, 1. Cor.
4.13. we are made the sweepings of the World, the off-scourings of all things,
the very dung-cart into which every man casts his filth to be carried
thorough the dung-port. Why then should we think much to be slighted?

Verse. 7. All they that see me laugh me* to scorn] Contemptus populi
ludibriis and opprebriis declaratur, Luke 22.63. The Apostle speaks of cruel
mockings, Heb. 11.36. The Pharisees who were covetous derided him, Luke 16.14.
and set his people on the stage as it were, for mocking-stocks, Heb. 10.23.
Now, post Carthaginem vinci neminem puduit, says the Historian. If Christ,
David, and other precious men were so disgraced and abused by the World; what
matter is it for us?

They shoot out the lip, they shake the head] God is sensible of any the least
affront or offense done to his people, be it but in an unseemly gesture, as
Labans lowrings, (See Matthew. 27.39.) and sets them upon record against the day
of account.

Verse. 8. He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him] Is this a
prophecy of of our Saviors sufferings, or an History rather? See Matthew.
27.43. with the Note.

Seeing he delighted in him] A most virulent Irony, whereby they sought to
cajole him of his confidence, and so to drive him into utter desperation and
destruction.

Verse. 9. But thou art he that took me out of the womb] When, but for thine
almighty midwifery, I might have been strangled; or, as an untimely birth,
never seen the Sun. It is no less than a miracle that the child is kept alive
in the womb, and perishes not in the midst of those excrements, and that in
coming forth, it dies not, etc. The very opening and shutting again of the
body when the child is to be born, is a thing so incomprehensible, that some
Naturalists acknowledge the immediate hand and power of God in it. But because
it is a common mercy, little notice is taken, or use made of it.

Thou did make me hope] Or, keptst me in safety; for puerilit as est
periculorum pelagus, a thousand deaths and dangers little ones are subject to;
but God preserves, and provideth; and haec non sunt per accidens, says
Kimchi, these things are not by chance, but by divine providence.

Verse. 10. I was cast upon thee from the womb] Id est, a Patre and Matre mea,
says Kimchi, by my Father and my Mother, whom thou Lord feddest, and filledst
her breasts, Veluti exposititius tibi fui a Matrice. Vat.
that she might suckle me. Did men but seriously consider what kept and fed
them in the womb, and at the breasts, when neither they could shift for
themselves, nor their Parents do much for them, they would conclude he would
much more now by their holy prayers, honest endeavors, etc.

Thou art my God from my Mothers belly] This is a privilege proper to Children
born within the Covenant, and they may claim it; they have God for their God
from their nativity; and they may lay their reckoning so in all their addresses
unto God.

Verse. 11. Be not far from me, for trouble is near] And so it is high time
for thee to put forth an helping hand. Homimbus profanis mirabilis videtur hac
ratio, to profane persons, this seemeeh to be a strange reason, says an
Interpreter; but it is a very good one, as this Prophet knew, who therefore
makes it his plea.

For there is none to help] Set in therefore, O Lord, and help, at a dead lift,
poor me, who am forsaken of all other hopes.

Verse. 12. Many Bulls have compassed mee] Young Bulls, which notes their
lustiness and courage; Tauri been saginati and petulci.

Strong Bulls of Bashan] A far Country beyond Jordan; famous for fat and
fierce cattle. Hereby are meant Princes and Potentates, persecutors of Christ
and his people, against whom they run and rush with utmost might and malice,
but not always with desired success. Of the wild Bull it is said, that of all
things he cannot abide any red color. Therefore the hunter for the nonce
standing before a tree, puts on a red garment; whom when the Bull sees, he
runs hard at him, as hard as he can drive; but the hunter slipping aside,
the Bulls horns stick fast in the tree; as when David slipped aside, Saul's
spear stuck fast in the wall. In like manner says a Divine, Christ standing
before the tree of his Cross, put on a red garment dipped and died in his own
blood, as one that comes with red garments from B^zra, Isa. 63.1. Therefore
the Devil and his agents, like wild Bulls of Bashan ran at him: But he saving
himself, their horns stick fast in the Cross; as Abraham's Ram by his horns
stuck fast in the briars.

Verse. 13. They gaped upon me with their mouths] As if they would have
swallowed me up at a bit, like so many Lycanthropi, or savage Canniballs.

As a ravening and a roaring Lyon] Rapiens and rugiens Le^, licet non sit mos
Boum rapere; Bulls do not use to raven though they roar; Kimchi.
but the malignities of all fierce and fell Creatures are to be found in
cruel persecutors. Would any man take the Churches picture, says Luther? then
let him paint a silly poor Maid sitting in a Wood or Wilderness, compassed
about with hungry Lions, Wolves, Bulls, Loc. cum de Persec.
Boares and Bears, and with all manner of cruel and hurtful beasts, and in
the midst of a great many furious men, or rather Monsters, assaulting her every
moment and minute; for this is her condition in the World.

Verse. 14. I am powered out like water] i.e. I am almost past all recovery, as
water spilt upon the ground.

And all my bones are out of joynt] Or, disparted, as on a rack, or by a
strappado. Who has not heard how Lithgow the Scot was used at Maligo in Spain,
Lithg. tra^.
by the bloody Inquisitours? (after that he had passed thorough the greatest
part of the known World, and traveled thorough Forests, Wildernesses and
Deserts where he met with thieves and murderers, Lions, Bulls, Bears, and
Tigers, and escaped them) how they starved him, wounded him, dis-joynted him,
in ten hours space laid seventy several torments upon him, though they had
nothing against him, but suspicion of Religion. And yet after this, God
wonderfully delivered him; so that he was brought on this bed wounded and
broken to King James, whose letters of recommendation he had for his safe
travel through the World, and to whom he made this relation to the face of
Gundamour the Spanish Ambassador. This was much, but yet little or nothing to
Christ's sufferings, whence that passage in the Greek Letany, (...), etc. By
thine unknown sufferings, good Lord deliverus.

My heart is like wax, etc.] Fear and faintness causes an extreme sweat (such
as was that of our Savior in his agony, Luke 22.44.) it disableth also the
Members from acting their parts, and softeneth the heart, Job 23.16.

Verse. 15. My strength is dried up like a potsheard] My spirits are utterly
spent, Viror met^^. Humidum radicale membra in (...) conglutinans. Abon-Ezra*
my natural moisture quite wasted and dried up; so that I am even like a
skin-bottle in the (...), etc. For my strength, some read my palar.

And my Tongue eleaveth to my jaws] That which ^eedeth and facilitateth the
motion of the tongue in speech is exhausted. Consider here the greatness of
the divine displeasure poured upon Christ our suerty: Words are too weak to
utter it.

And thom haft brought me into the dust of death] Here is the utmost of our
Saviors humiliation. Whilst alive he was a worm and no man; but now he is
lower; for a living dog is better than a dead Lion, says Solomon. O humble
Savior, whither will thou descend? Oh that the same mind might be in us, that
was in Christ Jesus, etc.

Verse. 16. For dogs have compassed mee] That is, men of mean rank (opposed to
Bulls and Lions, i. e. great ones and interpreted in the next words, the
assembly of the wicked, the rude rabble, and of rancorous disposition, Job
30.1. Prove. 26.11. Mat. 7.6. Phil. 3.2. Psalm. 59.7.15. Anno Dom. 1556. at
Wessensten in Germany, a Jew for theft was in this cruel manner to be
executed: He was hanged by the feet with his head downward, Melch. Ad. in vit.
Jac. And.
betwixt two dogs, which constantly snatched, and bit at him.

They peirced my hands and my feet] fc. When they nailed Christ to the Cross,
Mat. 27.35. Joh. 20.25. Where let me similate, says a learned man, the
Orators gradation, Facinus vincire civens Romanum, etc. It was much for the
Son of God to be bound, more to be beaten, most of all to be slain; Quid
dicam in crucem tolli? but what shall I say to this, that he was crucified?
that was the most vile and ignominious of all punishments; it was also a cruel
and cursed kind of death: which yet he refused not; and here we have a clear
testimony for his Cross, which the Devil would fain wring from us by his
agents, the Jews, with their Keri and Chetib. See Galatin. lib. 8. cap. 17. and
lib. 1. c. 8. and Mercer. in Job 7.20.

Verse. 17. I may tell all my bones] Now especially, when stretched out upon the
Cross, Quando pendens extentus erat in lign^, says Austin. Derident maciem
meam, says Kimchi.

They look and stare upon mee] Aspiciunt, id est, despiciunt, ut Cant. 1.6.
says Kimchi, they feed their eyes and passions with my misery, as Luke 23.35.
This (...) is the Devils disease, and declares a devilish disposition, sc. for
a man to make himself merry in other men's misery.

Verse. 18. They part my garments among them, and cast lots] A very clear
Testimony to us that our crucified God (as they scornfully term him) was the
true Messiah, so long since fore-prophecied of, and accordingly accomplished,
Luke 23.34. Joh. 20.24. Such Texts as this we should make much of, as the best
and iurest evidences of our Christian faith, 2 Pet. 1.19.

Verse. 19. But be net thou far from me, O Lord] Here he resumeth and
reinforceth his former prayer, after a most patheticall description of his so
doleful condition. Faith wadeth out of trouble (as the Moon does out of a
cloud) by hearty and affectionate prayer.

O my strength] God is so to a Believer; then especially when he feels
himself weak as water.

Hafte thee to help mee] Who am now in an^^igent, and am therefore bold,
without limitation, to request thee to haste away to me.

Verse. 20. Deliver my soul from the sword] i. e. From desperate and deadly
danger, from the wicked which is thy sword, Psa. 17.13.

My darling from the power of the dog] Heb. Mine only one from the hand, etc.
as Genesis 9.5. Sic est anima in corpore, ut in domo l^^ea, nec habet s^cium,
says R. David here. The soul is alone in its cottage of clay, and has no
companion. That was a mad fellow who gave out that he had two souls, one for
God, and another for whomsoever would have it; If the dog, that is the Devil
(as some interpret this Text) lay hands on this darling, it will be found to
be all that a man has, his alonely-soul, the loss whereof our Savior
shows to be both incomparable and irreparable, Mat. 16.26.

Verse. 21. Save me from the Lions mouth] 2 Timothy 4.17. David was often snatched
out of deaths mouth, and so was Christ; for although he had his life taken
away upon the Cross, yet was it (as Calvin here well observes) more
miraculously, and by greater power restored after death, than if he had been
delivered from the Cross; and it is a greater miracle to raise the dead, than
to heal the most dangerously sick, and to stay the life when it is departing.

For thou have heard me from the Horns of the Vnicorns] See Heb. 5.7. It is
ordinary with David to call his enemies, by the names of the fiercest
Creatures. This here mentioned, whether the Unicorn, or Rhinoceros, or some
other wild Beast (See Job 39.9, etc.) Cornua habet fortiera aliorum cornibus,
Asperrimath feram appella Plinius.
says Aben-Ezra: Et audivi qued de^ic^t seipsum ab alto monte super cornie
ejus, irrupto illo permanente.

Verse. 22. I will declare thy Name, etc.] Here begins the second part of
this Psalm, which is gratulatory, and declaratory of the fruit of Christ's
Passion and Resurrection, who is not here ashamed to call us Brethren; but does
communicate the Kingdom to us as coheirs with himself.

In the midst of the Congregation, etc.] viz. That I may not sing alone, but
in consort with others, and be their praecentor.

Verse. 23. Ye that fear the Lord praise him] viz. For your redemption by
Christ's Death and Resurrection. Neither are any fit for such a purpose but such
as fear the Lord. Excellent words become not a fools mouth, says Solomon:
Christ would not suffer the Devil to confess him. To be praised by a praiseless
person, is no praise, says Seneca.

All ye the seed of Jacob] i. e. Illi qui diligunt eum.

All ye the seed of Israel] Qui timent, sed adhuc non diligunt, says R.
David: but I like not his distinction; for none do truly fear God, but those
that love him, Hos. 3.5.

Verse. 24. For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction] Vel
responsionem, id est orationem qua est responsio linguae, Prove. 16.1. R. David.
With men a poor man's tale cannot be heard; and the answer given to such cuts
off half the Petition, as the Echo does the voice; but here it is otherwise. I
know thy poverty, says Christ to one of the Seven Churches: but (that is
nothing) thou art rich. God thinks not the worse of his Suppliants for their
meaneness, but the better rather.

Verse. 25. My praise shall be of thee in the great Congregation] where it may
be most public and exemplary. They that neglect public service for private,
do but read their own Indictment, pray their own punishment.

I will pay my vows, etc.] My Peace Offerings vowed in my distress; these are
heavily paid by most people, according to that Italian Proverb, The danger
once escaped, the Saint is defrauded. See David's care, Psalm. 116. and elsewhere.

Verse. 26. The m^^k shall eat and be satisfied] They shall be well filled at my
Peace Offering Feast, says David; at my holy Supper, says Christ: and in
meshall have the full fruition of all good things; as at a feast of fat things
full of Marrow, of Wines refined on the lees, Isa. 25. Nec copiam hujus saeculi
concupiscent nec timebunt inopiam, says Austin: here they shall neither covet
the wealth of this World, nor fear the want of it.

They shall praise the Lord] viz. At the Eucharist, and after.

Your heart shall live for ever] Apostrophe ad mansuetos Emphatica. You meck of
the earth, and seekers of the Lord, who have eaten of Christ's flesh that was
given for the life of the World, Joh. 6.51. Your heart shall live for ever: And
if so, then in death it self. As Aristotle gives the reason of the Swans
singing a little before his death, because generous blood goes then to the
heart, making it cheerful, and that thence comes the melody.

Verse. 27. All the ends of the World shall remember] Shall turn short again
upon themselves, as those Solomon prayed for, 1 King. 8.47. and the Prodigal,
Luke 15.17.

And turn to the Lord] From their dead Idols, as 1 Thessalonians. 1.9.

And all the Kindreds of the Nations, etc.] Christ, when he is lifted up, shall
draw all men to him, Joh. 11. the heavenly Eagles from all parts shall fly to
this dead, but all-quickning carcass, and shall feed thereupon.

Verse. 28. For the Kingdom is the Lords] The Spiritual Kingdom over the Church,
and the universal Kingdom over all the World belongs unto Christ, Diod.
the eternal God.

Verse. 29. All they that be fat upon earth] i. e. Rich and prosperous, wealthy
and well-liking, these shall feed on Christ, and be furthered thereby in his
service; so shall also the poorer sort called here,

They that go down to the dust, and that cannot keep alive, etc.] That is, that
are low kept, and half dead, through hunger and misery.

Verse. 30. A Seed shall serve him] And be saved by him, a remnant reserved for
royal use, a chosen generation, Romans 9.20. Isa. 53.10.

Verse. 31. Declare his righteousness] i.e. his Mercy and Goodness, they shall
propagate his praise to all posterity.

That he has done] Or performed, viz. the Salvation promised by Christ.

PSALM. XXIII.
Verse. 1. The Lord is my Shepherd] This Psalm may well be called David's
Bucolicon, or Pastoral; so daintily has he struck upon the whole string,
through the whole Hymn. Est Psalmus honorabilis, says Aben-Ezra; it is a noble
Psalm, written and sung by David; R. Kimchi. R. Solom.
not when he fled into the Forest of Hareth, I Sam. 22.5. as some Hebrews will
have it; but when as having overcome all his enemies, and settled his Kingdom,
he enjoyed great peace and quiet, and had one foot as it were upon the
battlements of Heaven. Leo. Modena
The Jews at this day use for most part to repeat this Psalm after they are
sat down to meat. God is often in Scripture called the Shepherd of his
people, Psalm. 80.1. Ezekiel. 34.12, 14, 15. Isa. 40.11. Joh. 10.11. 1 Pet. 2.25.
although non est officium magis contemptibile quam opilionis, says R. Jos.
Bar. Hamna. there is not a more contemptible office than that of a Shepherd.
Every Shepherd was an abomination to the Egyptians. But God disdaineth not to
feed his Flock, to guide, to govern, to defend them, to handle, and heal them,
to tend, and take care of them; and all this he has tied himself by Covenant
to do, Ezekiel. 34.25. well therefore might David confidently conclude,

I shall not want] Non deficiam, indigebo, destituar. The wicked in the fullness
of his sufficiency is in straits, Job 20.22. Tantalus-like, he is ever wanting:
content he has none. Contrarily, true piety brings true plenty, and a Saint is
never to seek of wel-contenting sufficiency, 1 Timothy 6.6. for to him, Parva seges
satis est. And he says, Discite quam parvo liceat producere vitam,
Et quantum natura petat, etc. Lucan, Pharst lib. 4.



Verse. 2. He makes me to lie down in green pastures] In folds of
budding-grass, where he feeds me daily, and daintily, plentifully, and
pleasantly, as among the Lillies, Cant: 6.3. that is, amidst the Ordinances (
David here seems to resemble powerful and flourishing Doctrine to green
Pastures, and the secret and sweet comforts of the Sacraments to the still
waters) where I shall not need to bite on the bare ground, but may go in and
out, and find pasture, Joh. 10.9. such as will breed life, and life in more
abundance, Joh. 10.10. Isa. 49.10. fat pastures he provideth, Ezekiel. 34.14. and
fair Coats, or Coverts from the Suns heat, as the word here used may also be
rendered. Confer Cant. 1.6. Virgil says, it is the office of a good shepherd,
Aestibus in mediis umbrosam exquirere vallem.

He leads me (Heb. Gently leads me) beside the still waters] Heb. waters of
rests, Ex quibus diligunt oves bibere, says Kimchi, such as sheep love to
drink of, because void of danger, and yielding a refreshing air. Popish
Clergymen are called the inhabitants of the Sea, Rev. 12.12. because they set
abroach gross, troubled, Brightman.
brakish, and sowrish Doctrine, which rather brings barrenness to their
Hearers, and gnaweth their entralls, than quenches their thirst, or cools
their heat. The Doctrine of the Gospel (like the waters of Sil^^, Isa. 8.6.)
run gently, but taste pleasantly.

Lene fluit Nilus, fed cunct is amnibus extat
Vtilior. Claud.

Verse. 3. De not. Animal. lib. 9
He restores my Soul] He reduces me, when like a lost sheep I have gone
astray, Psa. 119.176. A Sheep, says Aristotle, is a foolish and sluggish
Creature. Et omenium quadrupedum stupidissimum, aptest of any thing to wander,
though it (...) no want, and unablest to return. The Ox knows his owner, and
the Ass his Masters crib. Swine in a storm run home, and at night will make to
the trough; But a sheep can make no shift to save it self from tempests or
inundations; there it stands and will perish, if not driven away by the
shepherd. Lo such a silly shiftlesse thing is man left to himself. But
blessed be God for a Christ that best of Shepherds, who restores the lost
soul, and makes it to return into the right way, giving it rest, and causing
it to serve Him without fear in holiness and righteousness, Luke 1.74.

He leads me in the paths of Righteousness] Or, In plain smooth easy
paths, or sheep-tracks, wherein I may walk unweariably, unblameably, without
cessation or cespitation. The ways of sin are craggy, crooked, full of error,
and terror, leading to those precipices that tend to destruction. From such
stand off, says Christ to his sheep, who are all rational, and will be ruled
by him, Joh. 10.

For his Names sake] i.e. Of his free grace, and for his mere mercy-sake.
Otherwise, he would never do us any of these good offices, but let us alone to
perish in our own corruptions.

Verse. 4. Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death] In the
most dark and dangerous places, where there is Luctus ubique, pavor, and
plurima mortis imago, those dark places full of cruelty, Psalm. 74.20. where
Wolves wait for me. Though I walk (not step) through (not cross) the valley
(not a dark entry only) of the shadow of death (the darkest side of it, death
in its most hideous and horrid representations) I will not fear; for I fear
God, and have him by the hand; I must needs be Tutus sub umbra leonis, safe by
his side, and under his safeguard. It God be for us, who can be against us?

For thou art with mee] Hence my security; see a promise answerable to it, Joh.
10.28. Christ is not to lose any of his sheep, Joh. 17.12. Having therefore
this Ark of Gods Covenant in our eyes, let us cheerfully pass the waters of
Jordan, to take possession of the promised land. Cur timeat hominem homo, in
sinu Dei positus, says a Father?

Thy rod and thy staff] He pursues the former Allegory; Shepherds, in
driving their flocks, have a rod or wand in their hand, wherewith they now and
then strike them; and a staff or sheep-hook on their necks, wherewith they
catch and rule them. Of Christ's rods and staves, see Zach. 11.7. etc. foolish
Shepherds have only forcipes and mulctram, Zach. 11.15. R. Solomon, by rod
here understands afflictions, by staff support under them, a good use and a
good issue.

They comfort mee] Gods rod, like Aarons, blossometh; and like Jonathans, it
has honey at the end of it.

Verse. 5. Thou preparest a table before] Here he makes use of another Metaphor
from a liberal feast-maker, or (as some will have it) from a most kind Father,
making provision for his dearly beloved child; So did God for David, both in
regard of temporalls and spiritualls. God had given him (as he does all his
people) all things richly to enjoy, all things needful for life and
godliness, the upper and nether springs, the blessings of the right hand and
of the lest, bona throni, and bona scabelli, as Austin phraseth it. Now outward
prosperity when it follows close walking with God, is very sweet; as the
cipher when it follows the figure adds to the number, though it be nothing
in it self. David's Table was laden with Gods Creatures, and did even sweat with
variety of them. God had let down to him, as afterward he did to Peter, a
vessel with all manner of beasts of the earth, and fowls of the air in it,
Act. 10.12. This he is very sensible of, and thankful for, as a singular
favor.

In the presence of mine enemies] i.e. In fight and spite of them, hostibus
videntibus and ringentibus. God does good to his people maugre the malice of
earth and of Hell.

Thou anointest my head with oyle] A piece of entertainment common in those
times, and amongst that people, Luke 7.36, 37, 38. to show the greater respect
to their guests. And although this is not every good man's case in temporal
respects, yet at the Word and Sacraments God anointeth his guests with the Oil
of gladness.

My cup runs over] He had not only a fulness of abundance, but of
red^ndancy, Those that have this happiness must carry their cup upright, and
see that it overflow into their poor Brethrens emptier vesse^^s.

Verse. 6. Surely goodness and mercy, etc.] Vtique bonit as and beneficentia,
Or, as Tremellius has it, Nihil nisi bonum and benignitas, Nothing but
goodness and loving kindness, etc. This is his good assurance of Gods favor
for the future, grounded upon Gods promise; whereby he was well assured that
mercy should follow him, though he should be so foolish as to run from it;
like as the Sun going down, follows the passenger that goes Eastward, with
his beams.

And I will dwell, etc.] Devoted to his fear I will stick to him in life, in
death, and after death. Apprehensions of mercy in God, must work resolutions of
obedience in us.

PSALM. XXIV.
A Psalm of David] The Greek adds, Of the first day of the week (Because wont
to be sung in the Temple, on that day) which is now the Christian Sabbath, in
memory of Christ's resurrection and ruledome over all, which is here celebrated.

Verse. 1. The earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof] He alone is the
true Proprietary, Job 41.11. Deuteronomy. 10.14. and the earth is Marsupium Domini, as
One says, the Lords great purse; the keeping whereof he has committed to the
sons of men, Psalm. 115.16. like as also he has given the heavenly bodies to
all peoples, Deuteronomy. 4.19. every star being Gods storehouse, which he opens
for our profit, Deuteronomy. 28.12. and out of which he throws down riches and
plenty into the earth, such as the Servants of God gather, and the rest
scramble for. What use the Apostle puts this point to, See 1 Cor. 10.26, 28.
with the Notes. Other uses may well be made of it; as, that Kings and Princes
bear not themselves as Lords of all (the Turk and Pope so style themselves; the
great Cham of Tartary every day as soon as he has dined causes, they say, his
trumpets to besounded; by that sign giving leave to other Princes of the earth
(his Vassals, as he conceiteth) to go to dinner) but the Lords vicarii and
villici, vicegerents and Stewards, to whom they must give an account of all.
Again, that Gods dear Children cannot want any thing that is good for them;
since they have so rich a Father, who seems to say unto them, as Genesis 45.20.
Regard not your stuff, for all the good of the land is yours. To him that
overcommeth will I give to inherit all things; I have all things. Phil. 4.18 2
Cor. 6.10.

The world, and they that dwell therein] This is Gods universal Kingdom by
right of Creation, verse. 2. besides which he has a spiritual Kingdom over
his elect, (ut docet nos pulcherrimus hic Psalmus. says Beza) who are here
described, verse. 4, 5, 6. and encouraged to enlarge their desires after their
Sovereign in the exercise of faith, and use of means; and to give him the best
entertainment, verse. 7, 8, 9, 10. For the Church is Christ's Temple; and every
faithful soul is a gate thereof to let him in as Rev. 3.20.

Verse. 2. For he has founded it upon the Seas] The solid earth he has
founded upon the liquid waters. This Aristotle acknowledges to be a miracle;
as also that the waters which are naturally above the earth, overflow it not,
but are kept within their shoares, as within doors and bars. This is the very
finger of God, and a standing miracle, worthy to be predicated to his praise
all the World over, Job 38.6, 7, 8. etc. See the Notes there. See also Genesis
1.9. with the Note.

And established it upon the floods] Upon the waves and surges of the Sea;
which, but for Gods decree, would soon surmount it. The dry land is that which
is here called Teb. (...), the habitable world. And this is Gods universal
Kingdom, which because less considerable, the Prophet speaks but little of
it in comparison, as hastening to the spiritual.

Verse. 3. Who shall ascend into the Hill of the Lord] Montem caelestem
significat, says Vatablus, he means into Heaven; for the Prophets purpose
is to show, that although God made all, yet he will not save all; but that
there is a select number, c^lled and called out of the many, who shall be
everlastingly happy; and these are here characterized, as they are also, Psalm.
15. wherewith this Psalm has great affinity, and is thought to have been
composed at the same time, that is says R. David, post ne gotium Ornani
Jebusai, after the business with Araunah the Jebusite, when God by fire from
Heaven had pointed out the place where the Temple should be built, 1 Chro.
21.26. and 22.1.

And who shall stand in his holy place?] Stand with the Lamb upon Mount Sion?
Tautologia has est Hebrais perquam familiaris. Who is a true Member of the
Church militant? and shall be no lest of the Church triumphant?

Ver. 4. He that has clean hands] The clean in hands, that is, of innocent and
unblamable conversation; debet esse purus cord, ore, opere, says Kimchi,
Immunis (...) tetig^^ (...) Horat.
he must not touch that unclean thing, 2 Cor. 6.17. Non magna munera, sed
immunis manus mensque sincera Deo placent. Men must lift up pure hands in
prayer, 1 Timothy 2.8. or else their incense will stinck of the hand that offers
it, Isa. 1.13. Those that draw near to God must not only have their hearts
sprinkled from an evil conscience, but their bodies also washed with pure
water, Heb. 10.22.

And a pure heart] Which while Pilat wanted, it nothing profited him to wash
his hands in the presence of the people. Heaven is an holy place; and they that
would go thither, must cleanse themselves from all filthiness of flesh and
spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, 2 Cor. 7.1. The Serpent could
scrue himself into Paradise; but no unclean creature ever came into Gods
Kingdom. The Citizens of Heaven must here affect purity of heart, aim at it,
and in some measure attain to it too; the old frame of impure motions being
dissolved, etc.

Who has not lift up his soul unto vanity] i. e. Ad id^la vel opes, says One,
that is, to Idols, or riches, Jer. 22.27. but has lifted it up in the ways
of the Lord, as Jehosaphat did, 2 Chronicles. 17. and David, Psalm. 25.1. not heeding
or hankering after the Worlds delights, or the Devils delusions. Some write
the word Shau, signifying vanity, with a little Vau, ad indicandum quod minima
vanit as est vitanda, etc. to show, that he who would dwell in Gods holy
Mountain, must carefully avoid the least vanity that is; keeping Gods
Commandment as the apple of his eye, that will bear no jests, Prove. 7.2. Some
for his Soul, read my Soul; He has not taken in vain my Soul, that is, says
R. Obadiah, That soul inspired by God (which I also have received) he takes
not in vain, he misemployeth not to iniquity, but consecrateth to the service
of God, whose image and superscription it bears.

Nor has sworn deceitfully] Or inured his tongue to any other kind of the
language of Hell, rotten communication, to the dishonouring of God, or
deceiving of others. Perjury is here instanced for the rest, as one of the most
heinous. But Peraldus rekoneth up four and twenty several sins of the tongue;
all which every Burgess of the new Jerusalem is careful to avoid, as the
Devils drovill, Tom. 1. page 264.
no way becoming his pure lip.

Verse. 5. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord] i. e. Omnimodam
felicitatem, all manner of mercies, says Vatablus; he shall be as happy as
heart can wish; for great is the gain of godliness. See my Righteous man's
Recompense.

And Righteousness, etc.] i. e. The fruit and reward of Righteousness, which
the Righteous God will not fail to bestow upon all his; even the Crown of
Righteousness, 2 Timothy 4.8. A grave Interpreter has here observed, that there
is such a reciprocation between the description of this reward and the persons
described, Ames.
that the blessedness assured to the persons exciteth them to the care of
piety; and this care of piety brings unto them a sure and firm expectation of
blessedness.

Verse. 6. This is the generation of them that seek him] These are the true
Seekers, far different from those that now-adayes so style themselves; being
no better indeed than the Jesuits by-blowes, as one wittily calls them, M.
Baxsto^
though they are not yet so wise as to know their own Father. These are a
generation too, but an evil and adulterous, one in these last and loosest times
of abounding and abetted Errors.

That seek thy face] i. e. Thy favor, that desire nothing more than to be in
communion with thee and conformity unto thee.

O Jacob] Or, O God of Jacob: As the Church is called Christ, 1 Cor. 12.12. So
God is here called Jacob; such a near union there is betwixt him and his
people. Or, this is Jacob. So the true Seekers are fitly called, first, because
Israelites indeed, Joh. 1.47. Romans 9.6. secondly, because they see God face to
face, as Jacob did at Penuel, Genesis 32.24, 26, 29, 30. thirdly, because they
also, as he, Adjicitur Sel^ ut often da^^^ quantopere haec sentent sit
consider^^ da.
do bear away a blessing, Hos. 12.4. even Righteousness from the God of their
salvation, as in the verse aforegoing.

Verse. 7. Lift up your heads O ye gates etc.] Here he calls unto
Hell-gates, say the Papists; to the Heavens, say others, to give way to Christ's
ascension thereinto, Vatab* Justin. page 55. Recipite Christum in portis novae
Hierosol. Cyril.
as the first fruits, and the opener of the way to all his Members; And he
doubleth the same speech, verse. 9. for the joy that he had in the
contemplation thereof; bidding them again and again, lift up and be lifted up;
a phrase or term taken from triumphall arches, or great Portico's set up or
beautified and adorned for the coming in of great victorious and triumphant
Captains. There are at this day to be seen at Rome the ruins of Constantines
triumphall arch erected at that time when he entered the City, triumphing over
the Tyrant Maxentius, quem vicit signo crucis, as Eusebius reports; making
Christ to triumph at Rome, after those ten bloody persecutions; Vi^cars.
with which triumph this Psalm may fitly be compared, says a learned
Interpreter: Our late Annotatours tell us of a fashion in ancient times, that
when they would solemnize the entrance of any Prince, or others that had well
deserved of the public, they would break down the walls, and pull off the
gates of the City; partly for more free entrance, and partly to show that their
City needed no walls nor gates, as long as they had such a Guardian and
Protector within it. It is likely, say they, that David by these words does
allude to some such custom. Or as Calvin and others will have it, to the
Temple to be set up by Solomon; which he wishes were done, that so he might
bring in the Ark of the Covenant, hitherto transportative, into the place of
its rest, Psalm. 132.14. Certain it is, that the Saints, those living Temples of
the Lord, are here called upon to lift up their hearts, in the use of holy
ordinances; yea therein to be abundantly lifted up through faith, with a
joyful and assured wel-come of the King of Glory, who will thereupon come in
to them, by the ravishing operation of his love, benefits, and graces.

Verse. 8. Who is this King of glory?] The gates are brought in as asking this
question, says R. David. This is the Angels admiration at the coming in of
Christ's humanity into Heaven, says Diodate; Rather, it is the question of the
faithful concerning the person of their King, whom they hereby resist not; but
for their further confirmation, desire to be better informed of Him, and his
never-enough adored excellencies.

The Lord strong] Jehovah the Essentiator, the Eternal God; the most mighty
and puissant Warrior; who if he do but arise only, his enemies are scattered;
and all that hate him fly before him, Psalm. 68.1.

Verse. 9. Lift up your heads, etc.] See Verse. 7. And learn, that in matters of
moment we must be more than ordinary earnest, and importunate with our selves
and others.

Verse. 10. Who is this King of glory?] The best are acute obtusi in the mystery
of Christ crucified; and must therefore by study and inquiry grow in grace, and
in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 Pet. 3.18. praying for that Spirit
of wisdom and revelation, for the acknowledgement of him, Ephesians. 1.17.

The Lord of Hoasts] He who has all Creatures at his beck, and check, the
Lord of Sabbath, Romans 9.29. Jam. 5.4. where the word signifying hoasts or arms
is used untranslated; because well understood both by Jews and Gentiles, as is
also Hosanna, Hallelujah, Amen.

PSALM. XXV.
A Psalm of David] An excellent Psalm; the second of those seven called by the
Ancients penitential; and such as may well serve us for a pattern of our daily
prayers; Beza.
as wherein David beggeth three things (answerable to those two last petitions
in the Lords prayer) first, Pardon of sin; secondly, Guidance of Gods good
Spirit; thirdly, Defense against his enemies. It appears, that this Psalm was
made by David, when he was well in years, verse. 7. after his sin in the matter
of Vriah (that great iniquity as he calls it, verse. 11. says Vatablus) and
some gather from verse. 19. that he framed this Psalm, when Absalom was up in
arms against him, verse. 19. (compared with Psalm. 3.1.) See also verse. 15. and
22. It may seem therefore that when he came to Mahanaim, a Sam. 17.24, 27.
(where God showed him mavelous loving kindness in a strong City, Psalm.
31.21. and where-hence he was at the peoples request, to succor them, or to
cause them to be helped, viz, by his hearty prayers for Gods assistance, 2 Samuel 18.3.) he composed this Psalm with more than ordinary artifice, viz. in
order of Alphabet, as he has done also some few others, both for the
excellency of the matter, and likewise for help of memory; for which cause
also St. Matthew summeth up the genealogy of Christ into three fourteenes; all
helps being but little enough. Nazianzen and Sedulius, have done the like; the
former in his holy Alphabet, (...), etc. and the latter in his Hymn, A Solis
ortus cardine Beatus au^tor saeculi, etc.

Verse. 1. Unto thee O Lord, do I lift up my soul] i. e. Praeparo cor meum, Ad
te orand non ad Idola.
says R. Solomon. My heart makes its faithful addresses to thee (and not any
other) with strength of desire and delight, with earnest expectation and hope
of relief. See Jer. 22.27. Deuteronomy. 24.15. Psalm. 86.5. Cyprian says, that in the
primitive times the Minister was wont to prepare the peoples minds to pray,
Cyp. de orat.
by prefacing Sursum corda, Lift up your hearts. The Jews at this day write
upon the walls of their Synagogues these words, Tephillah belo cavannah ceguph
belo neshamah. That is, Buxtorf, abbreviar.
A prayer without the intention of the affection, is like a body without a
soul; and yet their devotion is a mere outside, says One, a brainlesse head,
and a soulelesse body; Spec. Eu^.
Antiquum obtinent, Isa. 29.13. This people draws nigh to me with their
lips, but their heart is far from me. A carnal man can as little lift up
his heart in prayer, as a moul can fly. A David finds it an hard task; since
the best heart is lumpish, and naturally bears downward, as the poise of a
clock, as the lead of a net. Let us therefore lay aside every weight, and the
sin that does so easily beset it; and pray God to draw us up to himself, as the
lodestone does the Iron, etc.

Verse. 2. O my God, I trust in thee] I pray in faith, which is as the fire, and
my prayer as the flame that arises out of it. Faith is the foundation of
prayer; and prayer is the fervency of faith. Now David knew that the hand of
faith never knocks at the gate of grace in vain.

Let me not be ashamed] Shame is the Daughter of disappointment. This David
deprecateth; Quaeque repulsa gravis; see Job 6.20.

Let not mine enemies triumph over mee] By saying, that I pray to no purpose,
as Rabshakeh did, Isa. 35.6. I say (says Hezekiah) I have words of my lips,
prayer; prayer? but alas, what is that more than empty words, an aerie
nothing? Counsel and strength are for the battle. Thus He.

Verse. 3. Yea let none that wait on thee be ashamed] Be nosed and twitted with
my disappointments, as they are sure to be, if I be repulsed by thee, and
worsted by mine enemies; all thy praying people shall have it cast in their
teeth, and laid in their dish.

Let them be ashamed which transgress without cause] Let shame be sent to
the right owner, even to those that deal disloyally, unprovoked on my part. And
so it was; for Achitophel hanged himself; Abso^om was trussed up by the hand of
God, and dispatched by Joab; the people that conspired with him, partly perished
by the sword, and partly fled home much ashamed of their enterprise. Oh the
power of prayer! what may not the Saints have for asking?

Verse. 4. Show me thy ways O Lord] q. d However other men walk toward me,
yet my desire is to keep touch with thee; for which purpose I humbly beg thy
best direction. See Exodus 33.13. Isa. 2.3.

Teach me thy paths] Assues ac me; inure me to thy paths, Sicut parvulus ad
ambulandum assuetus, says Kimchi, as a little one is taught to find his feet.

Verse. 5. Lead me in thy Truth, and teach mee] i. e. Assidue doce and urge.
David was a great proficient in Gods School, and yet he would learn more: so
sweet is divine knowledge. Four times together here, prays. David to be
further instructed. See Moses in like manner holily encroaching upon God, Exodus
33.12, 13, 16, 18. as if his Motto had been that of Charles the fisth,
Vlterius, More yet.

For thon art the God of my salvation] Perfect therefore that which concerns
me; Thy mercy O Lord endures for ever; forsake not the works of thine own
hands, Psalm. 138.8. Thou have written me down in thy book of preservation with
thine own hand; oh read thine own handwriting and save me, said Queen
Elizabeth in her troubles.

Verse. 6. Kemember O Lord thy tender mercies] Heb. Thy bowels, which thou
may seem to have lost, but I shall find them for thee. Where are thy bowels
and thy compassions? are they restrained? If thou have forgotten them (but that
cannot be) I shall be thy Remembrancer, and read them over unto thee out of
the Register of a sanctified memory.

For they have been ever of old] Etiam ad Adamum, qui vixit quasi mill annis,
Ever since Adam, and so onward says R. Solomon; and why not then to me, who
am one of thine, to whom mercy successively belongs in my generation, as it
did to mine Ancestors in theirs?

Verse. 7. Remember not the sins of my youth] Which, though long since
committed, must not be remembered without remorse; since for them God often
punishes men in their age, Job 13.26. Jer. 3.25. It is not the last sand that
emptieth the hour-glasse, nor the last blow that throws down the Oak. Sin may
sleep a long time, like a sleeping debt, not called for of many years; as Saul's
sin in slaying the Gibeonites, not punished till forty years after; as Jo^bs
killing of Abner slept all David's days, etc. It is not safe to be at odds
with the Ancient of days. This David knew, and therefore was willing to clear
all old scores, to get pardon of youthful lusts; lest they should put a sting
into his present sufferings. And that being thoroughly done, as he could expect
mercy and direction from God, so if any should maliciously upbraid him with his
bygone iniquities, he could answer as Austin did in like case, Quae tu
reprehendis, ego damnavi, What thou reprehendest in me, I have long since
condemned in my self. And as Reverend Beza, when a spiteful Papist hit him in
the teeth with his wanton poems set forth in his youth, and long before
repented of, Hic homo invidet mihi gratiam Christi, This fellow said he,
envieth me the grace of Jesus Christ.

Nor my transgressions] Or, prevarications, In personam Vriae, In the matter of
Vriak, says R. Obadiah; the sins of mine age, says Kimchi; all my faults of
former and later time, says another. David was well in years, when he defiled
himself with Bathsheba. In many young men, the Rose is cankered in the bud. And
again, as the canker soonest enters into the white Rose; so does corruption
easily creep into the white head. David prays God to forgive him his sins,
both of former and of latter time; and not to forgive them only, but to forget
them too; Remember not the sins, etc. And as he fitly joyneth memory of
mercies and forgetfullnesse of sins, so he forgets not to subjoyn

According to thy mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness sake, O Lord] Do
all of free grace, not for any motive or merit of mine. Lorinus a Jesuit here
brings in sundry passages (as well he may) Psalm. 6.8. and 51.3. and 69.14.
and 86.5.15. and 106.45. and 119.156. and 136.7. Dan. 9.18. Isa. 55.7. to prove
that all is of mercy, and not of merits.

Verse. 8. Good and upright is the Lord] i.e. Gracious, and righteous,' or
faithful; and hence it is, that our God is merciful, as Psalm. 116.5. hence it
is, as that we poor Creatures are not overwhelmed, aut magnitudine peccatoram,
aut male calamitatum, either with the greatness of our sins, or the multitude
of our miseries.

Therefore will he teach sinners in the way] i.e. Sensible sinners, meek and
mortified, as in the next verse, self-judging, and self-outed; those will he
teach to turn to him, and to walk before him in all well-pleasing; and this
Doctrine of direction must needs be good, because he is good, and certain,
because he is upright.

Verse. 9. The meek will he guide in judgement] Or, the poor (viz. in spirit)
will he make to tread in judgment, to foot it aright, to walk judiciously, to
behave themselves wisely as David did, 1 Samuel 10.14. so that Saul feared him 1 Samuel 23. 22. Natural conscience cannot but stoop to the image of God, shining
in the hearts and lives of the really Religious.

And the meek will he teach his way] Such as lie at his feet, and say, Speak
Lord for thy servant hears, such as whose hearts are supple and soluble,
tractable and teachable, so as that a little child may lead them, Isa. 11.6.
Austin was such an one, En adsu^ senex, Aug. Epist. 75. ad Auuil, Epis.
says he, a juvene coepisoop^ Episcopus tot annorum, a collega nondum anniculo
paratus sum disceer, i.e. I am here an old man ready to learn of a young man,
my coadjutour, in the ministry, who has scarce been one year in the service.

Verse. 10. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth] All the passages and
proceedings, both ordinantiall and providentiall whereby he comes and
communicates himself to his people, are not only Mercy (though that is very
sweet) but Truth; they come to them in a way of a promise from God, as bound to
them by covenant, this is soul-satisfying indeed; this turns all that a man
has to cream, when every mercy is a present sent him from Heaven by virtue of
a promise.

Unto such as keep his Covenant, and his Testimonies] i.e. His Law (that
singular Testimony of his goodness toward them) called a Covenant, because
he bargaineth with us, as it were, that we should keep it; which because we
can never do, he undertaketh to perform his own part, and ours too. Lex jubet,
gratia juvat, he works all our works in us, and for us; he gives us to be
what he bids us to be; this is the everlasting Covenant, and the fruits of
it are sure mercies, compassions that fail not.

Verse. 11. For thy names sake, O. Lord, pardon mine iniquity] Never did
prisoner at the bar beg more earnestly for his life, than David did for
pardon of his great offense, especially in the matter of Vriah; for that lay
heaviest. Peccatum (...) Bathsheba (...) jus petii (...) hac (...) nem, and
(...) repeto.
Could he but get off the guilt of that, it were an easy matter for him to
glory in tribulations with Paul, Romans 5.3. and to cry out with Luther, Feri
Domine, feri; nam a peccatis absolutus sum; Smite Lord, smite; for I am a
pardoned sinner, and therefore all is in mercy, R. David.
and for good.

For it is great] But that is nothing to so great a God, who delightest in
mercy, and make thy power appear in pardoning the many and horrid sins of thy
poor penitents. The high Heaven covers as well tall Mountains, as small
molehills. The vast Ocean swalloweth up huge Rocks, as well as little pibbles.
St. Paul was (for the first table) a Blasphemer, and (for the second table) a
Persecuter, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, says He; and why? that the
grace of our Lord might appear to be exceeding abundant, even to an over flow,
1 Timothy 1.13, 14. and that the glory of free grace might be so much the more
manifested, Romans 5.20. The more desperate was my disease, the greater is the
glory of my Physician, who has fully cured me, said Austin once to one, who
upbraided him with his former loose living.

Verse. 12. What man is he that fears the Lord?] This question implies,
first, a paucity of such, as Hos. 14. ult. secondly, the felicity of such as
out of a reverentiall fear of God, sue to him for pardon of sin, and seek to
be made his servants. Vatah. Utitur exclamatione Mol.
O quanta est felicitas istius viri! O the heaped up happiness of such a rare
man! David admireth it here; and well he may; for he has close communion
with God, and sweet communication of Christ's secrets, as follows.

Him shall he teach in the way that he shall chuse] i.e. That the good man
shall pitch upon. God will direct him in all dealings to make a good choice;
and will give good success. This is not in a man's own power to do, Jer. 10.23.
But the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delights in his
way, Psalm. 37.23. He was a pillar of fire, and cloud to the Israelites, Exodus
14.19. and carefully chose out their way for them; not the nearest always, but
yet the safest.

Verse. 13. His soul shall dwell at ease] Heb. shall lodge in good, Conquiescet
quemadmodum de nocte quie^ ci solet.
even then when his body happily is tossing on his sick bed, and at great
unrest. One being asked how he did? answered, My body is weak, my soul is
well. He shall be freed from the Devil of discontent, and have a blessed
self-sufficiency; such, and better than he had, whom Horace describes Ephod.
2. Beatus ille qui procul negotiis, etc. such as good Jacob had, when he said,
I have enough my Brother, etc. Tremel.
Godliness only has such a contentedness, 1 Timothy 6.6.

And his seed shall inherit the earth] Gods love dies not with the Parents;
but reviveth in their posterity, 2 Samuel 7.12.

(...) Theocr^
It would be a great stay of mind to us, if God should say of our Children, as
once David did of Mephibosheth, and afterward of Chimham; I will take care of
them, and see them well provided for. He does upon the matter say as much and
more, to every Believer.

Verse. 14. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him] It is neither
learning nor labor that can give insight into Gods secrets, those Arcana
imperii, Mat. 13.12. the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, the mind of
Christ, 1 Cor. 2. ult. these things come by revelation, rather than discourse
of reason, and must therefore be obtained by prayer. Those that diligently
seek him, shall be of his cabi net counsel, shall know his soul-secrets, and
be admitted into a gracious familiarity and friendship, Joh. 15.15. Henceforth
I call you not servants, for the servant knows not what his Lord does; but I
have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have
made known to you.

And he will show them his Covenant] As having no greater secret to impart to
them, than by showing them the Covenant of Grace, his good pleasure and purpose
of their eternal Salvation: to make them know the love of Christ which passes
knowledge, that they may be filled with all the fullness of God, Ephesians. 3.19.
The Jews bragged much of Gods Covenant, but here they are given to understand,
that only such as fear God are Covenanters. Acts 13.16. Men of Israel, and ye
that fear God, give audience.

Verse. 15. Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord] I look him full in the face, and
confidently expect deliverance. This he speaks, says one, in reference to
the Army that he had sent out to meet Absalom, 2 Samuel 18.1. nothing doubting of
getting the day.

For he shall pluck my feet out of the net] Of evil concupiscence, says
Aben-Ezra; rather of my foes, those crafty and cruel Fowlers.

Verse. 16. Turn thee unto me] Heb. Face about toward me.

And have mercy upon me] There being no such mercy, as to have thy favor. This
is a voluminous mercy.

For I am desolate and afflicted] As all Creatures flag and hang the head, when
the Sun is eclipsed. Misery is an object of Mercy; as it was to the
compassionate Samaritan.

Verse. 17. The troubles of my heart are enlarged] Whereby my heart is sorely
straightened, so that I can hardly breath: Oh, hide not thine ear at my breathing,
at my cry, R. Obad. Cor vix capax tribulationum mearum. Vat.
Lam. 3.56. En patet in curas area lata meas: all afflictions enter into mine
heart, as by a wide gate.

Out of my distresses] Where with I am pent up, and pinched; as afterward Paul
was pricked with the messenger of Satan.

Verse. 18. Look upon mine affliction, and my pain] My griefs under which I
groan and labor; my concupiscence, says Aben-Ezra, against which I strive,
but prevail not.

And forgive all my Sin] Heb. Lift up, take away; lay them on the true
Scapegoat, on that Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the World, Joh.
1.29.

Verse. 19. Consider mine enemies, for they are many] This was to David half a
promise, and a whole reason that he should be helped; since it was come to an
extremity. If God but look out of the pillar of Cloud upon the Egyptian Army,
it is enough for their utter confusion, Exodus 14.24.

And they hate me with cruel hatred] Of their craft he had complained, verse.
15. now of their cruelty. These are never sundred in the Churches enemies; as
the Asp, they say, never goes without his mate. See Esai. 34.16.

Verse. 20. O keep my Soul] The repetition of the self-same Petition argues
earnestness, and is not always battologie.

Let me not be ashamed] rendered scornful and scandalous.

Verse. 21. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me] Integrity of Conscience,
and uprightness of conversation.

For I wait on thee] viz. For the accomplishment of thy promise, That with the
upright thou will show thy self upright, Psalm. 18.11.

Verse. 22. R. David.
Redeem Israel, etc.] In vita vel post mortem means, Either whiles I live, or
after my death. This is every good man's care, and prayer. None is in case to
pray for the Church, that has not first made his own peace with God.

PSALM. XXVI.
Verse. 1. Judge me, O Lord] i.e. Judge betwixt me and mine enemies; not betwixt
me and thee, as R. David expounds it; for then I am sure to be found faulty.

For I have walked in mine integrity] viz. Toward Saul, whatever his pickthank
Courtiers suggest against me; as Psalm. 7. which is much like this, and made as
it may seem about the same time as this, viz. about the beginning of Saul's
persecution raised against David, 1 Samuel 22.7. etc. who thereupon appealeth
here to Gods just Judgment, and stands upon his Justification, as holding fast
faith and a good conscience,

Therefore I shall not slide] Or, not far; I shall not be greatly moved,
Psalm. 62.2. Moved I may be, but not removed; shaken, but not shivered; thrust
at, but not thrown down, etc. because bottomed and built upon the rock of Ages,
Isa. 26.4, 2 Cor. 4.8.

Verse. 2. Examine me O Lord, and prove me] It must needs be a good Conscience
that thus boldly offers it self to Gods trial; so Job 31.6.

Try my reins and my heart] i.e. Mine affections and thoughts; for these are
sibi mutuo causa. Whilst I mused, the fire kindled, Psalm. 39. David was neither
ambitious nor factious, as his adversaries represented him.

Verse. 3. For thy loving kindness is before mine eyes] And that is a strong tie
upon my Conscience. The cords of love are the cords of a man, Hos. 11.4. To sin
against Mercy is to sin against Humanity, it is no less than bestial, than
devilish. When therefore I am tempted to recompense evil for evil, thy loving
kindness comes before me, and reigns me in.

And I have walked in thy truth] i.e. according to thy Word: I have led a
Bible-conversation, though solicited to do otherwise by the Courtiers, and
Politicians, with that profane Proverb of their (...), comply with the times,
Theog.
and be not so straight-laced: Religiosum eportet esse, sed non Religentem.

Verse. 4. I have not sat with vain persons] who are void of Gods holy fear,
but filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness,
etc. Romans 3.29. Courtiers are such for most part, and David never delighted in
such company, to sit with them, especially when they were acting mischief;
which whiles Gromwell did at the condemnation of Lambert Martyr, and Sir John
Cheek, at other such like meetings, they were cast upon no small snares and
inconveniences. See Jer. 15.17.

Neither will I go in with dissemblers] Heb. close workers of iniquity, Qui
secreto male agunt, Chald.
secret and sly Sirs, such as hide themselves to do evil, as the Chaldee has
it, and can carry their wickedness cleanly and closely, so as that the World
shall be little the wiser, Versatiles and versutili, multiplices, Protei; such
as can serve the times, and shift their sails to the sitting of every Wind,
Machiavellians, Ahitophels, Jonadabs, 2 Samuel 13.3. These men's wisdom may serve
them, as the Ostriches wings, to make them outrun others upon earth, though it
be into Hell-mouth, but help them never a whit toward Heaven; David therefore
would have nothing to do with them, he would neither enter, walk, nor sit with
any such (Confer Psalm. 1.1.) they should not sprinkle him with their
Court-holy-water.

Verse. 5. I have hated the Congregation of evil-doers] The Church Malignant,
whose lives are a Mystery of iniquity, as Josephus says of Antipater; qui
emnia turbant and miscent, tantum ut ipsi crossere possint, as Aristophanes
says of Cleon; care not whom they ruin, so they may raise themselves, nor
what mischief they work to others, so they may drive on their own sinful
designs. Luther said of the Monks in Germany, that they were so bad, tam
desperate malitiae, ut nihil cogitent quod non idem patrare ausint, that they
would stick at no villainy whatsoever. David held it a hell to be in company
with such incarnate devils. It was once the prayer of a good Gentlewoman when
she was to dye, being in much trouble of Conscience, O Lord, let me not go to
Hell where the wicked are, for Lord, thou know I never loved their company
here.

And will not sit with the wicked] But hate the very garment spotted by the
flesh, Jude 2, 3. that is, a void evil company, says Mr. Perkins, as Levit.
15.4. so Deuteronomy. 22.12. It is not safe coming near stinking Catrion, except one
have the wind of it. Sin is as catching as the plague.

Verse. 6. I will wash mine hands in innocency] As Exodus 40.32. So 1 Timothy 2.8.
Sic Egyptii sacerdotes apud Herod in Euterpe, tertio quoque die corpus eradunt,
etc.
See Deuteronomy. 21.6. Isa. 1.15. Iam. 5.8. If in our addresses to God we cannot wash
our hands in innocence, yet we must wash them in tears; Quem pocnitet peccasse,
pene est innocens, says Soneca; Penitency is well-nigh as good as innocence;
but one way or other be sure to come clean when you come to Gods Altar, when
you draw nigh to him in holy duties. We wash our hands every day, and often,
but when we are to sit with some great person, we scour them with balls; so
here, we must be always holy, but especially when we present our selves to the
holy eyes of our Creator; And hereby David differenceth himself from the wicked
in the use of Ordinances, wherein they were as forward as the best ( Doeg may
set his foot as far into the Sanctuary as David, and cry, the Temple of the
Lord, etc.) but cared not to come clear thereunto; their hands were full of
blood, their hearts full of wickedness.

So will I compass thine Altar, O Lord] i.e. I will cover it with Sacrifices
and Oblations, and perform what is required of me diligently and cheerfully.
The people might not touch the Altar, but only see afar off what was done there
by the Priests. D. Am.
Howbeit, those that were more zealous among them, to the end that they might
have a full view of the services, stood not still in one place, but stirred up
and down on all sides of the Altar; and some such thing David did, when he is
said to have danced before the Lord, 2 Samuel 6.14.

Verse. 7. That I may publish] This was the end David propounded to himself in
all his solemn services; that he might set up God, and not serve himself upon
God.

And tell of all thy wondrous Works] All Gods Mercies to his are Wonders, if
well weighed in their several circumstances. But we commonly deal by them, as
Solomon did by the brass of the Temple, it was so much that he weighed it not.

Verse. 8. Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house] Much more the people,
and the Ordinances there, but most of all the Lord himself of that house (as if
a man love the Schoolmaster for his Childs sake, he loves his Child much
more) and hence it is that I so hate the Society of the ungodly; For what
communion has Christ with Belial? The word rendered habitation, some derive
from a word that signifies the eye, and therefore render it sight, or beauty;
the Seventy (...) comeliness. The Protestants at Lions in France called their
public meeting place Paradise.

And the place where thine honor dwelleth] i.e. Where thou thy self dwell,
or thine Ark, which is called Gods glory, 1 Samuel 4.21. Psalm. 78.61. yea Gods
self, Psalm. 132.5. and Gods face, Psalm. 105.4.

Verse. 9. Gather not my soul with sinners] I have loved thy House, which
sinners never delighted in; therefore gather not my soul with sinners; so the
Syriack senseth it. Let me not dye the death of Sinners, for I never cared for
their company; so the Rabbines. See the Note on verse. 5. Let me not share with
them in punishment, for I could never abide their practice. Balaam would dye
the death of the righteous, but he liked not of their life. Euchrites would be
Craesus vivens, and Socrates mortuus. Sir Walter Rawleigh would live a Papist
(there being no Religion like that for Licentious liberty, and lasciviousness)
but dye a Protestant. We have some that would gladly dance with the Devil all
day, and then sup with Christ at night; live all their lives long in Dalilaes
lap, and then go to Abraham's bosom when they dye. But this cannot be, as David
well understood; and therefore both eschewed the life of a wicked person, and
deprecated his death; Gather not, or take not away, etc. The righteous is taken
away (Heb. gathered, Isa. 57.1. as men gather Flowers and candy them, preserve
them) with such to be gathered, David would hold it an happiness, but not with
sinners, with sanguinaries; for such are gathered but as house-dust, to be cast
out of doors.

Verse. 10. In whose hands is mischief] Wicked contrivance. Here we have the
true portracture of a corrupt Courtier, such as Saul's were.

Verse. 11. But as for me, I will walk] Whatever others do, their example shall
be no rule to me to deviate. See my Righteous man's recompense, D. 1.

Redeem me, etc.] For I am likely to suffer deeply, for my singularity.

Verse. 12. My foot stands in an even place] i.e. Mine affections are in an
equal tenor. A good man is (...) the scales of his mind neither rise up
toward the beam through their own lightness, or their overweening opinion of
prosperity; nor are too much depressed with any load of sorrow, but hanging
equal and unmoved between both, give him liberty in all occurrences to enjoy
himself.

I will bless the Lord] For performance of promises; chiefly in that great
Panegyris, Heb. 12.

PSALM. XXVII.
Verse. 1. The Lord is my light] That is, my comfort and direction, he that
dissolveth all my clouds of serrours within, and troubles without. To these all
he opposes Gods All Sufficiency, as making for him, and as being All in all
unto him, Light, Salvation, Strength of Life, what not? and there-hence his
full assurance; and such a masculine magnanimity as fears not the power of
men and Devils, be they who they will, and do what they can. Animo magno nihil
est magnum. When a man can out of this consideration, God is my light (inthings
of the mind) and my Salvation, (in things of the body, as Aben-Ezra expounds
it) contemn and reckon all things else as matters of small moment, it shows he
has in truth apprehended God: and this is true holy magnanimity.

The Lord is the strength of my life] He that keeps life and soul together,
says Aben-Ezra, as the Spirits do soul and body; and therefore, Quis potest me
interimere, says Kimchi, who can do me to death?

Of whom shall I be afraid] Faith fortifieth the heart against distrustful
fears; which it quelleth and kills. In a fright it runs to the heart, as
the blood does, and releeveth it, setting it (...), out of the Gunshot of
Creature-annoyances, Expertus loquor; for

Verse. 2. When the wicked, even mine enemies, came upon me] Made impression
upon me, with utmost violence, and open mouth, as if they would have devoured
me, Cannibal-like; or as a Lion does a sheep, inhumanissime, ferarumque more,
says Junius, barbarously, and beastly.

They stumbled and fell] Irritis conaitibus corruerunt, they utterly lost their
design, as did those Amalekites who had sacked Ziglah, 1 Samuel 30. and Saul
often. If a man stumble, and fall not, he gets ground; but if after much
blundering he kiss the ground, hefalleth with a force. David's enemies did so,
Corruerunt and conciderunt; they were irreparably ruined.

Verse. 3. Though an Host should encamp against me] See Psalm. 3.6. with the
Note. We should propound the worst to our selves (the best will bring with it,
as we say) especially if we find our faith to be in heart and vigor, as here
David's was.

Though War shouldrise against me] War is a complexive evil, and is therefore
called so by a specialty, Isa. 45.7. I make peace, and create evil, that is,
War; Sin, Satan and War have all one name (says a learned Divine) evil is the
best of them; the best of sin is deformity, of Satan, enmity, of war, misery.

In this will I be confident] In this? In what? In this one ensuing Petition,
says Aben-Ezra; or, in this that I have said before, The Lord is my light and
my Salvation; in this confident gloriation of mine, which is such as an
unbeleever is a perfect stranger unto.

Verse. 4. One thing have I desired of the Lord] One thing above the rest. Every
of Gods suppliants has some one special request that he mainly insisteth on;
Ut cultu Del libeto and legitimouti possit Jun.
and King David's was the liberty of Gods Sanctuary, and enjoyment of his
public Ordinances.

Hoc primus petit, hoc postremus omittit. This was dearer to him than Wife,
Children, Goods, all. This Suit he knew to be honest, and therefore he began
it; and being so, he is resolved never to give it over, but to prosecute it to
the utmost, and to persevere in prayer (which is a great virtue, Romans 12.12.)
till he had prevailed.

That will I seek after] As Gods constant Remembrancer, who loves to be
importuned, and as it were jogged by his praying people. Herein David showed
himself a true Israelite, a Prince of God, and (as Nazianzen styles Basil the
Great) (...), a man of desires flowing from the Spirit. He knew well that a
faint Suter does but beg a denial.

That I may dwell in the House of the Lord] i.e. In the place where was the
Ark, with the Prophets, Priests, Levites, Asaph and his brethren, etc. with
whom David desired to be taken up in the service of God, free from Secular
cares and delights, at times convenient. Pyrrhus told Cyneas, that when he had
finished his Wars once, he would then sit still and be merry. The Roman
Generals when they had once triumphed over their enemies, might take their ease
and pleasure for ever after. But good David resolves to improve his rest when
ever God shall grant it him, to perpetual piety, That I may dwell, says he, or
sit in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life; this was the height of
his ambition, this was David's delight.

To behold the beauty of the Lord] Heb. The delight, amenity, or pleasantness
of Jehovah; hoc est cultum Dei ordinatum, says Kimchi, those ceremonial
services which were their Gospel, and Christ in figure, Heb. 8.5. whom David
desired to contemplate

And to enquire in his Temple] Heb. Early to enquire, that is, earnestly, what
that good and holy and acceptable will of God is. Here it was that David used
to seek satisfaction and resolution of his doubts and scruples; when at any
time he was gravelled, Psalm. 73.16, 17. Some render it, ut lustrem Templum ejus.

Ver. 5. For in time of trouble he shall hide mee] This protection he boldly
promises himself as a fruit of his faith, fostered by the use of the
ordinances. He knew that the only way to be safe, was to get under Gods wing,
Psalm. 91. to take sanctuary there, to be hid under Gods Altar; for upon all
the glory there is a defense, Isa. 4.5. Joash was preserved six years in the
sanctuary, where he was hid. The Sanctuary is called Gods hidden place, Ezekiel.
7.22. and his Saints, his hidden ones, Psalm. 83.4.

In his Pavilion] The Hebrew Succoh is written with a little Samech, to show,
say the Masorites, Quod tabernaculum exile (...) est asylum tutissimum.
that a little pavilion or cottage where God is, shall be sufficient to
safeguard the Saints.

In the secret of his tabernacle] I shall be as safe, as if I were shut up in
his holy Ark.

He shall set me upon a Rock] Out of mine enemies reach.

Verse. 6. And now shall mine head be lifted up] See Psalm. 3.4. and take notice
how clear David was upon his prayer, of the possession of the promise, that he
should both get the better of his enemies, and enjoy the public ordinances.

Sacrifices of joy] Heb. Of loud shouting, hoc est sacrificia cum canticis,
says R. Solomon. Sacrifices with triumph, alarm, or jubilation to the Lord;
not with profane triumphings, as the manner of the World is; as if by mine own
strength or prudence I had gotten the victory. So at the battle of Agincourt
when our Henry the fifth had beaten the French, the honor of the day was, by
the Kings command, Speed. Daniel.
ascribed only to God. He would not suffer his broken Crown, or bruised armor
to be born before him in show; or any ballads to be set forth or sung in his
honor, etc.

Verse. 7. Hear O Lord, when I cry] This was his form of prayer, or to this
effect, when he was in any distress or danger; As a good soldier of Jesus
Christ he had weapons, not only defensive (the shield of Faith, helmet of
Hope, breastplate of Righteousness, etc. as Ephesians. 6.) but also offensive,
viz. the darts of Prayer, as here, and the sword of the Spirit, the Word of
God, as in the next.

Verse. 8. When thou said Seek ye my face, etc.] Or, My heart said unto thee
(or, for thee, and in thy stead) Let my face seek thy face, etc. Or concerning
Thee, said my heart, that is, I have constantly considered of those words of
thine, Seek ye my face, and therefore I come confidently unto thee. See Deuteronomy.
4.19. Upon which Commandment (involving a promise) David seems to ground this
speech of his. R. Solomon has it thus, Thou have said to my heart, Seek ye my
face, that is, Thou have told me by thy Spirit that all Israel should seek thy
face, and as for me, I will surely seek thy face.

My heart said unto thee, etc.] My heart (moved and inspired by thy Spirit
working in me a gracious compliance) ecchoed out as it were, Thy face, etc.
See the like, Jer. 3.22. Return ye backsliding Children, and I will heal your
backslidings; behold we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God. Every
godly person has the duplicate of Gods law in his heart; and is willingly cast
into the mould of his word, Romans 6.27.

Verse. 9. Hide not thy face far from mee] For then it will be to no purpose
for me to seek it; eclipse not thy favor, withold not thy succor, but meet
me; yea, prevent me with thy loving kindness. Tantum velis, and Deus tibi
preoccurret, says an Ancient.

Put not thy Servant away in anger] Thy Servant I am, though a sinful servant,
and such as provokes thee to displeasure; nevertheless reject me not as thou
have done Saul, and sundry others, for their misdoings. So 2 Samuel 24.16. take
away the iniquity of thy servant: and to prove himself so, he adds, For I
have done foolishly; As some godly learned think, hereby intimating, that if
he deserved not to be called Gods servant in regard of his late sin; yet in
regard of his latter service of confession. God puts away many in anger for
their supposed goodness; but not any at all for their confessed badnesse.

Thou have been my help, leave me not, etc.] It is a good note that one gives
upon these words; The godly many times have such earnest affections in prayer,
that they can hardly content themselves with any words, to express their minds
with-all.

Verse. 10. When my Father and my Mother forsake mee] Or, For my Father and my
Mother do forsake me (that is, they are not able to help me) but thou, etc. 1 Samuel 22.1, 3
There is an Ocean of love in a Parents heart toward their even untoward
Children, as was in David toward Absalom, after all his unnatural
miscarriages; insomuch as Joab upbraideth him with it, 2 Samuel 19.6. But all the
mercies of all the Fathers and Mothers in the World put together, make not the
tithe of Gods mercy toward his Children, Isa. 41.15.

Then the Lord will take me up] Heb. will gather me, that is, take me into
his care and keeping. In the Civil law we find provision made for outcasts and
friendlesse persons; some Hospitalls to entertain them, some liberties to
comfort, and compensate their trouble. It Is sure, that in God the forlorn and
fatherless find mercy, Hos. 14.3. See 1 Samuel 22.2, 3. Joh. 9.35. Jer. 30.17.
In the Israelites marching through the Wilderness, at the fourth alarm arose
the standard of Dan, Asher, and Nephthali; and to these was committed the care
of gathering together the lame, feeble, and sick, and to look that nothing was
left behind; whence they were called the gathering host, Josh. 6.9. Unto this,
some think David here alludeth.

Verse. 11. Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead mae, etc.] Deus non deserit
sues, duns cos docet ac ducit, God shows that he forsakes not his (whatever
other friends do) so long as he teaches and leads them. See Psalm. 25.4, 5.
with the Notes.

In a plain path] Heb. In a way of plainness, wherein I may escape mine
enemies ambushes.

Because of mine enemies] Or, Because of mine observers; so it may be read;
Propter insidiatores meos.
such as Saul and Doeg were, who looked upon David with an evil eye, and
watched for his halting. It was the wisdom of the Lacedaemonians always to
send two Ambassadors together, which disagreed among themselves; Aristoc.
Polit. lib. 2. cap. 7
that so they might mutually eye one another actions. The wicked will be
eying and prying into the practices of good people, who must therefore watch
and pray.

Verse. 12. Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies] Heb. Unto the
soul: for the wicked are carried on against the godly, with all their soul, as
it were.

For false witnesses] Such as whereof Saul's court was full, viz. his Aiones and
Negones, who fed his humor by traducing and denigrating innocent David.

And such as breath out cruelty] As Saul breathed out threatening against the
Disciples, Act. 9. So did David's spit-fires.

Verse. 13. I had fainted, unless I had beleeved] Saved he was then by his
Faith, which drank to him as it were in a cup of Nepenthes, and fetched him
again, when ready to swoon and sink. See Psalm. 119.92. The word rendered
Unless, here, Lule habe^ puncta stipra and infra.
is (as the Masorites note) one of the fifteen Scripture-words, that were
extraordinarily pointed by the men of the great Synagogue. The reason whereof
given by Kimchi and others (as if David doubted of his salvation) is not
satisfactory, nor sound.

To see the goodness of the Lord] That is, to taste; one sense usually put for
another; the soul also has her senses; and these must be habitually exercised
to discern good and evil, Heb. 5. ult.

In the Land of the living] That is, here on earth, ( Psalm. 316.9. Isa. 38.^^.
where men live; and I my self have not only a portion of life with them, but a
promise of many good things besides. To blame therefore was good David, when
he said in his haste, All men are liars, Prophets, and all who had promised
him the Kingdom, Psalm. 116.10. But the best have their passions; which they
daily outgrow, and add to their faith patience, 2 Pet. 1.5, 6. And albeit as
Calvin here notes, every ones case is not like David's, who had particular
promises concerning this life, beyond many other faithful persons; yet,
because according to every man's faith it shall be unto him, let us all
likewise trust in God, as we are all hereupon exhorted in the next words.

Verse. 14. Wait on the Lord] Expecta, expecta. See how earnest good David is
with himself and others; for he knew men's dullness, and the difficulty of the
duty. Religious men find it more easy to bear evil, than to wait till the
promised good be enjoyed, Heb. 10.36. the spoiling of their goods required
patience; but this, more than ordinary. Let our distance from God, our
dependence upon him, and our undone condition without him, be but considered;
and we shall be the willinger to wait, yea to want, and go without some
things, that we are but too much set upon.

Be of good courage] Be confirmed, hold fast, play the man (as the Seventy
have it, and the Apostle uses the same word, 1 Cor. 16.13.) and let not the
big words of thine enemies make thee to cast away thy confidence, which has so
great recompense of reward.

And he shall strengthen thy heart] Or, let thine heart be confirmed, cheer
up, hold out faith and patience.

Wait I say on the Lord] i. e. De die in diem expecta, wait still; do it from
one day to another. God is a free agent, neither is it fit for us to send for
him by a Post. Many of his promises bear a long date; but they are sure and
infallible. Wait therefore, and why? See Habakkuk. 2.3. with the Note.

PSALM. XXVIII.
Verse. 1. Unto thee will I cry O Lord my Rock] That thou may grant me what
I begged so earnestly of thee in the former Psalm especially, verse. 4. One
thing have I desired of the Lord, that I will seek after, etc. For this Psalm
is of the same subject with that; and seems to have been made much about the
same time; viz. after that David had twice spared Saul's life, 1 Samuel 24.4, 5,
6, etc. and 26.12, 21. Only here he expresses himself, not as if he had been
a private person, and in daily danger of his life; but as destined and designed
to the Kingdom by Almighty God, to whom therefore he prays for himself and
the people, and against their inplacable enemies, with so great confidence, as
that he presently praises him for his request obtained, verse. 6.

Be not silent to mee] Cease not, as deaf, from me. If God seem to be deaf to
us, we must cry the louder; that having prepared our hearts by such a seeming
silence, he may cause his ears to hear, Psalm. 10.17. which he will not fail to
do, when once we set up our note, and make bitter moan.

Lest if thou be silent, etc.] Here are his reasons to help his hope to be
heard. God is well pleased that we argue it out with him in prayer.

Like them that go down into the Pit] Or, dirty dungeon, that is, the grave;
or, as Kimchi, lest I be as the wicked, that go down to Hell. The Righteous
perishes, Isa. 57.1. that is, the World looks upon them as lost.

Verse. 2. When I lift up my hand] An ordinary gesture in prayer; expressing
faith (for they held out their open hands, as craving beggars with the Palms
upward, 1 King. 8.22.) and helping fervency; whilst hands and heart went up
together to God in the heavens, Tertul.
Lam. 3.40. Preces fundimns, colum (...), misericordi^^ (...), etc.

Toward thy holy Ona^^^] Called Debbir, because there-hence God spoke and gave
answer, Toward this (a^ype of Chrift, the Word essential) David lifts up his
hands that it might be as a Ladder, whereby his prayer might get up to Heaven.
Hered. Clio.
The Devil also (who delights to be Gods ape, but for man's mischief) gave or
and c^at. (...) and elsewhere; but (...) and (...) doubtful and lying; as to
Croesus, Pyrrbus, others. But the eternity of Israel cannot lie, 1 Samuel 15.
every word of God is pure, he is a shield to them that put their trust in him,
Prove. 30.5.

Verse. 3. Draw me not away with the wicked] Who seek to draw me away from my
settled purpose of attending upon thee (...), 1 Cor. 7.35. and are therefore
likely to be drawn away by thee to Execution, as Malefactors are drawn, hanged
and quartered (there wants but a hurdle, a horse, and a halter, said Belknapp
to do me right) as Sisera was drawn by God to the River Kishon to be ruined,
Sen.
Judge. 4.7. Ducunt volentem fata, nolentem trahunt.

Which speak peace to their Neighbors, but mischief is in their hearts] Saul
and his Courtiers are here noted. Pers.


Astutam vapido servantes pectore vulpem. The Florentine Secretary (Machiavell)
was not born of many years after; but the Devil was as great a Master then as
afterward; and David often complains of it.

Verse. 4. Give them according to their deeds] God loves to retaliate; and
David out of a public and prophetic spirit (not from private revenge, or
troubled affectious) takes thus upon him to imprecate,

And according to the wickedness of their endeavours] They were therefore old
habituated irreclaimable sinners whom he thus cursed, And against such, this
and such like imprecations are still in force.

Give them after the works of their hands] Because they regard not the works of
thine hands, Verse. 5. Par pari, says Aben-Ezra here.

Verse. 5. Because they regard not the works of the Lord] that is, says Kimchi,
the worship of God they care not for; but follow the vanities of the World. Or,
the works of God in heaven and earth; the consideration whereof is a part of
Gods worship. Or, they regard not the works of the Lord, that is, the first
making: nor The operation of his hands] that is, the present disposing of his
Creatures, either by way of mercy, or judgment, whereof these brutish persons
make no observation at all, Psa. 92.5, 6, 7. Isa. 5.12. particularly they
neither regard my present affliction, Amos 6.6. nor believe my future
exaltation to the Throne, as God has promised me; but oppose it all they can;
and would gladly prevent it, which yet they cannot, but will be found fighters
against God.

He shall destroy them, and not build them up] Destroy them in this World, and
not build them up in the World to come, say the Rabbines. Or, as others, he
shall break them down, as men do old rotten ruinous houses, Jun.
and never more repair or rebuild them. Non potest Deus non perdere judicuis
suis, qui non crudiuntur documentis. They that will not be ruled, shall be
ruined. See 1 Samuel 2.25.

Verse. 6. Blessed be the Lord, because he has beard, etc.] God will one day
turn the prayers of his people into praises. David Verse. 1. had said, Be not
silent to me; here, Blessed be God, for he has answered me. So Jehosaphat
had his Bacah soon turned into Berachah, 2 Chronicles. 20.18, 19. See David's
Syllogism; and mark his Conclusion, Psalm. 66.18, 19, 20. not according to the
rules of Logic, but better.

Verse. 7. The Lord is my strength and my shield] So that I am furnished and
harnessed within and without. See Psalm. 18.2.

My heart trusted in him, and I am helped] Faith substantiateth things not yet
seen, Heb. 11.1. it alters the Tenses, says One, and puts the future into
the present tense, as here.

My heart greatly rejoices, etc.] Inwardly I am glad, warmed at heart; and
outwardly cheerful, even unto singing. And what will David sing? See his Ditty
in the next words.

Verse. 8. The Lord is their strength] Not mine only, as verse. 7. but the
strength of all and every one of the holy Community, of true Christians,
partakers of Christ's unction, of his Spirit.

Verse. 9. Save thy people] The Church must share in our prayers.

And bless thine inheritance] Which cannot but be dear to thee.

Feed them also] For they are but ill-favouredly fed by Saul.

Lift them up] Over all their enemies, as Psalm. 27.6.

PSALM. XXIX.
Verse. 1. Give unto the Lord] Verbo and confessione, says Kimchi; By word and
confession, as Josh. 7.19. Jer. 13.16. acknowledge him the King immortal,
invisible, etc. and your selves his Vassals; as did those three best Emperors,
Constantine, Theodosius, and Valentinian. Cedite, colite, step back, stoop,
humble and tremble before this dread Sovereign of the World; bear an awefull
respect to the divine Majesty, the High thunderer, the great Wonder-worker;
unless you will come short of brute beasts, and dumb Creatures.

O ye Mighty] Heb. Ye sons of the Mighty, Grandees and Potentates, who are
readiest to rob God of his glory, and being tumour'd up by their worldly wealth
and greatness, to deem or rather dream themselves demi Gods; such as may do
what they list, as not accountable to any mortal. The Septuagint render it, O
ye Sons of Ramms. These Bel-weathers should not cast their noses into the air,
and carry their crest the higher, because the shepherd has bestowed a bell
upon them more than upon the rest of the flock.

Give unto the Lord] Give, give, give; This shows how unwilling such are,
usually to give God his right; or to suffer a word of exhortation to this
purpose.

Glory and strength] By ascribing all to him, casting down your Crowns at his
feet, setting up his sincere service wherever ye have to do, etc.

Verse. 2. Nominatissimam and celeberrimam. Jun.
Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name] Which yet you cannot do; for
his name is above all praise, Psalm. 148.13. but you must aim at it. The
Rabbines observe that Gods holy name is mentioned eighteen several times in
this Psalm; that great men especially may give him the honor of his name, that
they may stand in awe and not sin, that they may bring presents to Him, who
ought to be feared, and those also the very best of the best, since He is a
great King, and stands much upon his seniority, Mal. 1.14.

Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness] Or, In his glorious Sanctuary;
therefore glorious, because there they might see Gods face, and hear his voice
in his ordinances. Away therefore with your superstitions, and will-worships;
and bring your gifts to his beautiful Sanctuary; for no where else will he
receive them. Send a Lamb to this Ruler of the earth, Isa. 16.1. as an
homage-penny.

Verse. 3. The voice of the Lord is upon the waters] Thunder is here called (and
fitly) the voice of the Lord (being brought as one instance of those many other
glorious works of his in nature) because it comes from him alone. Natural
causes there are assigned of it; The ancient Romans said Deus tonat, Deus
fulgurat, for which now Tonat, fulgurat.
but we must not stick in them, as Epicurus and his Hoggs would have us. The
best Philosophy in this behalf, is to hear God Almighty by his thunder speaking
unto us from Heaven, as if he were present; and to see him in his lightenings,
as if he cast his eyes upon us, to behold what we had been doing. This voice of
the Lord is fitly instanced as an evidence of the divine power and Majesty;
because it is so dreadful, even to the greatest Atheists; as it was to Caius
Caligula that potent Emperor, Sueton.
ready to run into a mouse-hole in a time of thunder.

The God of glory thundereth] And men quake before him; as worms at such a time
wriggle into the corners of the earth. And yet your dive-dappers duck not at
this rattle in the air, though they do at a far smaller matter: So, many
tremble not at Gods terrible threats, that yet are afraid of a penal statute.

The Lord is upon many waters] viz. When he thundreth; De aquis pendulis
loquitur, says Vatablus; He speaks of the waters in the clouds, which are
many, and of great force, as appeared in the general deluge; and does still
appear by that infinite inundation of rain that follows upon the thunder
claps. Some render it, The Lord, or, the voice of the Lord is above many
waters, i. e. above the loud roaring of many waters, which is even drowned by
the thunder.

Verse. 4. The voice of the Lord is powerfull] So that it shakes heaven and
earth, Heb. 12.26. Validum est and vehemens tonitru. Vat. Beza.
Cogitent ergo Principes quantum infra Deum subsidant, etc. Let those that
think themselves some great business, consider Gods infinite power, putting
forth it self in thunders, and tempests, and they will soon be crest-faln.

The voice of the Lord is full of Majesty] Heb. In Majesty; it is magnificall,
and immutable, though some fools have attempted to imitate it (as a certain
King of Egypt, and Caligula the Emperor) by certain Engines and devices.

Verse. 5. The voice of the Lord breaks the Cedars] i. e. The thunder; and
those things that either go before it, or follow it, as lightenings,
thunderbolts, storm, tempest, etc. breaking and turning up by the roots huge
trees.

The Lord breaks the Cedars of Lebanon] Which are the tallest, thickest and
most durable of any place, in the habitable World. What a shame is it then that
our hard hearts break not, yield not, though thunderstruck with the dreadful
menaces of Gods mouth? Corripimur sed non corrigimur, etc. A fearful case. Let
the tall Cedars see to it. Nam per Cedros intellig it (...) quicquid est
eximium in mundo; Where is that hammer of the Nations Nebuchadnezzar? that
terror of the World, Tamerlan, etc? Are they not broken in pieces as a Potters
Vessel?

Verse. 6. He makes them also to skip like a Calf] Young living Creatures are
full of motion. God by his thunder and earthquake thereupon (for so the Hebrews
understand it) makes not only those huge trees, the splinters of them, to fly
up into the air, but also the Mountains whereupon they grow, to skip and jump
out of their places, and aloft from their center.

Lebanon and Sirion, etc.] Or, Hermon, two known Mountains.

Verse. 7. The voice of the Lord divides, (Heb. cutteth out) the flames of
fire] i. e. The lightening which the thunder is said to strike, or cut out,
Deuteronomy. 3.
because it causes them to shoot and glide; it immediately follows one
flash, and goes before another; dispersing and darting them hither and thither.

Verse. 8. The voice of the Lord shakes the Wildernesse] i. e. The beasts
abiding in the Wildernesses, the most savage creatures, those that lie in
woods, and are most fearlesse of men, are put to pain by thunder, and made to
travel with trembling.

The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh] Thorough which the Israelites
passed into Canaan, Number. 13.27. the beasts whereof were cruel, Deuteronomy. 8.25. and
32. Animalia quantumvis horrifica. Jun.
10. Beza paraphraseth, and Arabum tesqua succutit, it shakes the Cottages of
the Arabians.

Verse. 9. The voice of the Lord makes the Hindes to calve] Which they
naturally do not, without a great deal of difficulty, Job 39.4, 5, 6. See the
Note there.

And discovers the Forrests] By driving the beasts into their dens, baring
the Forests of their leaves and fruits, turning up trees by the roots, and so
making a clear prospect thorough woods and groves, as one phraseth it.

And in his Temple does every one speak of his glory] Heb. Every one, or, every
whit of it says Glory; Every godly man observing his dreadful thunder, Moller.
and other his stupendous works, says, Glory be to God on high. Some
conceive that this Psalm was appointed by David to be sung in the Temple in
time of thunder; which is not unlikely. There are that make God to be the
Nominative case to the Verb speaks, and render it thus; And in his Temple, or
Palace, does be utter all his glory. Tremel.
As if the Psalmist should say; Much of his glory God utters in his thunder;
but all in his Temple. For whatsoever there he speaks with his mouth, he
fulfilleth it with his hand, Psalm. 115.3. and 119.91. and 33.9. Isa. 44.26. See
a like collation of Gods works and word, with a praelation of this above those,
Psalm. 19.1-7. Psalm. 111.7.

Verse. 10. The Lord sits upon the flood] He reigned in that general deluge
in Noah's days, Genesis 6. and 7. and does still over those horrible inundations
that follow upon thunder and strong-tempests; ruling that raging Element, and
governing all by his providence, and sovereign power.

Yea the Lord sits King for ever] And over all; therefore all, even the
Mightiest should give him glory, as Verse. 1.

Verse. 11. The Lord will give strength unto his people] To bear up their hearts
in time of thunder, or other terrible occurrences.

The Lord will bless his people with peace] Pace omnimoda, With peace
internal, In tempore to nitru. Aben Ezra.
external, eternal; for godliness has the promises of both lives, of
prosperity, safety and welfare, both of soul and body.

PSALM. XXX.
A Psalm and song] i.e. An holy hymn, first framed in meeter; then sung with
men's voices.

At the dedication of the house of David] Either when it was new built, 2 Samuel
5.11. confer Deuteronomy. 20.5. Neb. 12.27. saying as He once, Jamq, meos dedotibi,
Princeps, jure Penates,
Tu mibi jus dederas, posse vocare meos.


God so loves his people, that their walls are ever in his sight, Ifa. 49.16.
they should therefore have holiness to the Lord written upon them, Zach. 14.
sanctified they should be by the word and prayer, 1 Timothy 4.5. Or else, after he
had defiled it by his Adultery, with Bathsbeba, and Absalom had much more
defiled it by his abominable incest and other villainies, See 2 Samuel 20.3.

Verse. I. I will extol thee O Lord, for thou have lifted me up] De puteo
peccati canoso, says Kimchi, out of the miry pit of fin; or out of the ditch
of deadly danger, say others. Therefore I will extol thee, that is, I will have
high and honorable conceptions of thee. I will also do mine utmoft, both by
words and deeds, that thou may be acknowledged by others to be as thou art,
the great and mighty Monarch of the whole World.

And have not made my foes to rejoice over mee] Befides all former victories,
Absalom and Sheba were lately slain.

Verse. 2. I cried unto thee] In some great sickness, say some, that befell him
about the time that he built his house of Cedar, 2 Samuel 5. that he might not be
overjoyed, and take a surfeit: Or rather, when by my sons rifing up against
me, I was likely to have lost my state and Kingdom.

Andt hou have healed mee] That is, helped me, as Jon. 2.6. thou have restored
and re-established me in my Kingdom. Kimchi senseth it thus, Thou have
delivered my soul from Hell, though in this World thou have grievously
afflicted my body.

Verse. 3. O Lord thou have brought up, etc.] Here he says the same again as
before; the better to set forth the greatneffe of the benefit, and so to excite
himself to due thankfulness. The uttermost extremity of a calamity is to be
acknowledged, after we are delivered out of it, Isa. 38.10.

Thou have kept me alive] Thou have rescued me from instant death; and this I
look upon as a resurrection from the dead.

Verse. 4. Sing unto the Lord] Here he calls in help to praise God, as holding
himself too weak to do it a lone. Publication of Gods praises should be
seconded by provocation of others to do the like. David thought one mouth too
little to do it.

O ye Saints of his] Or, Chafid. Plus, Benignus.
O ye his merciful ones, that having partaken of his mercy, are ready to
impart the same to others; and not to pull up that bridge before them, that
your selves have once gone over.

At the Remembrance (or memorial) of his holinesse] That is, at his Tabernacle,
say some; that his holineffe, his grace and goodneffe may be always had in
remembrance, say others; and that which he does for us be carefully kept upon
record.

Verse. 5. For his anger endures but a moment] Though it lasts all a man's life;
for what is that to eternity? Junctumest quod vivimus and puncto minus. But it
soon repents the Lord concerning his servants; whom, out of love displeased,
he corrects for a short braid, Ifa. 54.7, 8.2 Cor. 14.17. Isa. 26.20. Heb.
10.37. Tantillum, tantillum, adbuc pusillum. Bear up therefore, faint not, fret
not.

Flebile principium melior fortuna sequetur. If our sorrows be long, they are
light; if sharper the shorter. The sharp North East Wind never lasts three
days; nothing violent is permanent.

In his favor is life] Vita in voluntate, else we should dye in our sins; but
his favor never fails. Kimchi here notes that of those thirteen attributes
of God, Exodus 34.7. twelve are mercy, and one only is anger. Joseph for his
thirteen years of servitude and imprisonment, had fourscore years freedom and
preferment. David's persecution by Saul was but a moment to his following
happineffe when once he came to the Kingdom.

Weeping may endure for a night] Diseafes and aches are worst toward night. At
even-tide lo there is trouble; but before morning it is gone, Isa. 17.14
mourning lasterfi but till morning, and then departs; as did Lots two Angels.
The morning of the Resurrection howsoever, shall put a period to all our
miseries; and make a plentiful amends.

But joy comes in the morning] Heb. Singing; flebilibus modis modus
adbibebitur. God turns his peoples sighing into singing, their musing into
music, tears into triumph, wringing of hands into dapping of hands for joy,
etc. And as there is a vicissitude of nights and days; so of crosses and
mercies to Gods people, whiles they are in this vale of misery, and valley of
tears. God checkereth his providence (says One) white and black; he
speckleth his work, as is set forth by those speckled horses among the
Myrtle-trees, Zach. 1.8. Mercies and Crosses are interwoven. This World is
called a valley of tears, or as some render it, of Mulberrytrees, Psalm. 84.6.
Betwixt them both, they may make up an emblem of the Saints condition here.
Tears are moist; Mulberries grow in dry places. Gods people have their
interchanges of joys and sorrows, whilst here. See in this and the following
verses the circle God goes in with them. David was afflicted and delivered, in
this verse; In the next he grew wanton. Then he is troubled again, Verse. 7.
cries again, 8, 9. God turns his mourning into mirth again, 11, 12.

Verse. 6. And in my prosperity I said] Or, In my tranquillity; then it was that
he was overgrown with security; as was also Job, chap 29.18, 19, 20. See the
Note there; and Job 9.18. How many have burnt their wings about Jobs candle?
chap. 29.3. says One; Oh the hazard of honor ^ damage of dignity! how soon
are we broken upon the soft pillow of ease a Lunaticks, when the Moon is
declining and in the wain, are sober enough; but when full, more wild and
exorbitant. Flies fettle upon the sweetest persumes when cold; so do sin and
Satan's temptations on the best hearts, when dissolved and dis-spirited by
prosperity; Watch therefore. Niobe apud Ovid. Major sum quam cui poffi fortuna
nocare.
Adam in Paradise was overcome; when Job on the dunghill was a Conqueror.

I shall never be moved] Excessere metum mea jam bona. David by misreckoning
of a point, mist the haven, and had almost run upon the Rocks. How apt are the
holiest to be proud and secure? even as worms and wasps eat the sweetest
apples and fruits. What reasonhad David to promise himself more than ever God
promised him, immunity from the Croffe? Did he think (as Dionysius afterward
did, Aelian. ^ var hist. lib. 2.
but was clearly confuted soon after) that his Kingdom, and with it
prosperity. was tied unto him with cords of Adamant? what though he sat quietly
now at Jerusalem, 2 Samuel 11.1. free from fear of enemies? and could find time
to look and lust after his neighbors wife, would this always hold, thought
he? and could not God set up his own darling Absalom, to put him to trouble?
No; David said in his prosperity, Non vacillabo. I shall never be moved; and
why?

Verse. 7. Lord, by thy favor thou have made my mountain, etc.] Yea, but there
is no mountain so strong that may not be moved, if not removed with an
Earthquake. Is it not as easy with God to blast an Oak, as trample a mushrome?
And what though God in his favor had seeled strength to David's mountain? what
though he had constituted and established it sure as Mount-Zion (for there was
David's arx, and aularegia) which cannot be removed, but abides for ever? Psalm.
125.1. yet by a turn of his countenance only, God can soon dis-sweeten all his
enjoyments, and plunge him into a deplorable condition.

Thou did hide thy face and^^ was troubled] i. e. Thou did suspend the
actual influence and communication of thy grace (the Chaldea calls it
Sheahinab the divine prefence) and I was all-amort. The life of some creatures
consists in the E^^ so does that of the Saints in the light of Gods
countenance. And ^sun an Eclipse of the Sun there is a drooping in the whole
frame of nature so when God hides his face, the good soul labors and
languisheth. And as none look at the Sun but when it is in the eclipse; so
neither prize we Gods loving countenance, till we have lost it.

Verse. 8. I (...), O Lord, etc.] For why? I felt my self (...) while that I was
deserted, in a kind of Hell above-ground. Hac tentatio initium aliquod and
gustus fuit illorum inenarr abilium dolorum quos impii sentiunt in omni
aternitate. David felt himself now in the suburbs of Hell, as it were; and does
therefore set up as loud a cry after God, as once Micah did after his mawmets,
Judge. 18. and far greater cause he had.

And to the Lord I made supplication] He knew that the same hand alone must
cure him that had wounded him; neither was Gods favor recoverable, but by
humble confession, and hearty prayer. Some think to glide away their groans
with games, and their cares with cards; to bury their terrors and themselves
in wine and sleep. They run to their music with Saul, to building of Cities
with Cain, when cast out of Gods presence, etc. sed haret lateri lethalis
arundo; but as the wounded Deer that has the deadly arrow sticking in his
side, well he may frisk up and down for a time, but still he bleedeth, and will
ere long fall down dead: so it is with such as feek not comfort in God alone,
as make not supplication to Him for Him; as return not to God who has smitten
them, nor seek the Lord of Hoasts, Isa. 9.13.

Verse. 9. What profit is there in my blood, etc?] i.e. In my life, say some, q.
d. To what purpose have I lived, since Religion is not yet settled? In my death
(say others, Diolat.
and better) a violent death especially, and out of thy favor? Now all
believers have ever abhorred such a kind of death, before they were reconciled
to God, and had a true feeling of his grace.

Shall the dust praise thee, etc?] See Psalm. 6.6. with the Note.

Verse. 10. Hear O Lord, and have mercy upon me] When faith has once said to
God what it has to fay, it will wait for a good answer, relying on his mercy,
and expecting relief from the Lord, as here David does; looking in the mean
whiles, through the anger of his corrections, to the sweetneffe of his loving
countenance; as by a Rainbow we see the beautiful image of the Suns light, in
the midst of a dark and waterish cloud.

Verse. 11. Thou have turned from me my mourning, etc.] Sustulisti luctum, and
latitiam attulisti. See the Note on verse. 5.

Ver. 12. To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee] i.e. That my
tongue, oyled from an heart enlarged, may exalt thee according to my bounden
duty, and thine abundant desert. A good tongue that watches all opportunities
to glorify God, and edify others, is certainly a man's great glory; but an
evil tongue is his foul shame. Basil expounds glory by (...) the spirit or
soul. The Chaldee Paraphrast, Laudabunt to honor abiles mundi, The glorious
ones of the World shall praise thee.

O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever] Epiphonematica and
pathetica conclusio, Davidi ex summis calamitatibus erepto familiaris. He
concludes as he began, engaging his heart to everlasting thankfulness; and
therein becoming a worthy pattern to all posterity.

PSALM. XXXI.
A Psalm of David] made, say Vatablus and others, at that time when Saul
pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon, 1 Samuel 23.24. But by many
circumstances and passages of this Psalm it appears more probable, that it
was, as the former, composed when Absalom was up, 2 Samuel 15.10. etc. See verse.
11, 12, 22. of this Psalm, with 2 Samuel 17.24, 27. and 19.33. Joseph. Autiq.
lib. 7. cap 9.

Verse. 1. In thee O Lord do I put my trust] Hic Psalmus varia mixtus and magna
affectnum vicissitudine insignis est, This Psalm is strangely mixed and made up
of many and diverse passions and petitions; according to the change of times
and estate. In the time of affliction he prays, in the time of consolation he
praises the Lord, Ercles. 7.15. In these three first verses is little said,
but what had been before said; and is already opened.

Let me never be ashamed] i.e. Repulsed, worsted, defeated.

In thy Righteousnesse] And not according to mine own Righteousness, says
Kimchi, or according to thy faithfulness.

Verse. 2. (...)] This repetition of his petition is no vain babbling, as Mat.
6.9. but an effect and an evidence of greatest earnestneffe, as Mat. ^6.44.

For an house of defence] Where the enemy can as little hurt me, as when I was
in the Hold, 1 Samuel 22.4.

Verse. 3. For thou art my Rock and my fortresse] Such places David had been
forced to fly to; but still he trusted in God.

Lead me and guide mee] Duc me, and deduc me. A Metaphor from Captains and
Generals, who lead on their armies with greatest art and industry. Vatab.


Verse. 4. Pull me out of the net] That noted net, as the Hebrew has it; Nam
Z^ denet at rem notam omnibus, says Kimchi. David was not caught in it; but
the enemies presumed he would be; so selling the hide before the beast was
taken; as did likewife the proud Spaniards. when coming against England in
eighty eight, they triumphed before the victory, and sang.

Tu qua Romanas suevisti temnere leges,
Hispano disces subdere collajugo.
But blessed be God, the net brake, and we escaped, Psalm. 124.7.

For thou art my strength] As a tree is strongest at the root, and a branch or
bough next the trunck or stock; and the further it grows out from thence, the
smaller and weaker it grows too: So the nearer the Creature is to God, the
stronger; and on the contrary.

Verse. 5. Into thine hand I commit my spirit] So did our Savior, so did St.
Stephen, and diverse of the dying Martyrs with these very words, most apt and
apposite surely for such a purpose. But what a wretch was that Huber^^ who dyed
with these words in his mouth, I yield my goods to the King, my body to the
grave, and my soul to the Devil.

Thou have redeemed] And so have best right unto me.

O Lord God of truth] I know whom I have trusted.

Verse. 6. I have hated them that regard lying vanities] i.e. Idols, or ought
else besides the living God, who gives us all things richly to enjoy, 1 Timothy
6.17. See Jon. 2.8. with the Note. Vanitates vanitatis, Vatablus renders it,
and tells us, that some understand it of Astrology. R. David does so in this
Note of his upon the Text, Astrologos and in cantatores in fuga mea non
consului, sed in Domino and prophetis ejus confisus sum; I have not consulted
Astrologers and Soothsayers in my trouble; but have trusted to the Lord and his
Prophets.

Verse. 7. I will be glad and rejoyce] In the midst of trouble faith will find
matter of joy; as extracting abundance of comfort in most desperate distresses
from the precious promises, and former experiences.

Thou have known my soul in adversity] God knows our souls best, Psalm. 1.6. and
we know him best, in adversity. Isa. 63.16. the Church thought she should know
him, in the midst of all his austerities.

Verse. 8. Thou have not shut me up, etc.] i.e. Not given me into their power.
See Psalm. 27.12.

Thou have set my feet in a large room] So that I can freely and fearlesly go
in and out. See Psalm. 25.15.

Verse. 9. Have mercy upon me O Lord] Antiquum obtine, Do now Lord, as thou
hitherto have done.

For I am in trouble] Overwhelmed with the terrors of death, and ready to
sink, animus mihi pendet, I know not what to do.

Mine eye is consumed with grief] Computruit facies men, mine eye (^itor oculi,
vet facies) is gnawn away, or worm-eaten.

Yea my soul, and my belly] Belly may be taken for the whole body, which was
pined away and infeebled with pensiveness. Votablus by soul understands the
natural appetite after meat, and by (...), the disge^tion, both which (...).

Verse. 10. For my life is spa^^ with (...), etc.] Which (...) of life, and soon
snappeth it in sunder, 2 Cor. 7.10. See Prove. ^7.22. and ^5, with the Notes.

My strength faileth] So that I stumble and stagger, (...)

Because of mine iniquity] Or, My misery; for (...) and the Scripture often
confounds the names of the cause and of the effects.

And my bones are consumed] Heb. Moth-eaten.

Verse. 11. I was a repreach among all mine enemies] Such as Shi^^ti, who now
insulted lustily; Leoni mortuo velmus insultat.

But especially among my mighbours] My near-allies and friends, such as Absolem
and Abitophel; these most vexed me.

Ask a fear to mine acquaintance] It is no new thing that those which should
most love men, do sometimes, either for fear or flattery of others, make least
account of them.

They that see me without (or, in the streets) fled from mee] To s^ift for
themselves; fith to own me whom they could not help, was bootlesse, and
besides perilous.

Verse. 12. I am forgotten, as a dead man out of mind] How soon dead men are
forgotten, even by those that promise to remember them longest of all;
experience teaches; trust not to protestations of best friends in that case.

I am like a broken Vessel] Of which there is no further use, or esteem.

Verse. 13. For I have heard the slander of many] Or, as Calvin, Mollerus, and
others render it, Magnorum, of the great ones, such as take counsel (so it
follows here) which the Vulgar seldom do; and their tongues often are no
slander, as we say.

Fear was on every side] Mager missabib, Pashurs new name and doom, Jer. 20.3,
4. But good David's condition at this time; without were fightings, within were
fears.

While they took counsel together against mee] See 2 Samuel 16.20. where we have
an exposition of this verse.

Verse. 14. But I trusted in thee, O Lord] In this distress I acted my faith
upon thy power and promises; this was right, and that which God aimed at; for
we can no way more honor him. Hence it is that he is very jealous of our
trust; neither can he endure that any Idol of jealousy should be set up in
our hearts.

I said, thou art my God] In nearest relation, and dearest affection, whatever
befalls me.

Verse. 15. My times are in thy hand] Both the time of my abode on earth, and
all those various occurrences of that time; all is predetermined by Thee;
particularly how long I shall suffer, and when I shall be delivered. See 1 Chronicles. 29.30. Joh. 7.30.

Deliver me from the hand of mine enemies] Oh command deliverances for me;
for thou can casily do it. And here observe how David rises in his requests;
He laid the Covenant for a foundation, and then he well knew he might be bold
to ask any thing.

Verse. 16. Make thy face to shine, etc.] Which by reason of the clouds of
affliction clustering about me, I cannot for present perceive. See the Notes
on Psalm. 4.6. and 30.7.

Save me. etc.] i.e. Deliver me out of these dangers.

Verse. 17. Let me not be ashamed] i.e. Disappointed of my hopes.

Let the Wicked be ashamed] For they call not upon God, but shame those that
do, Psa. 14.4.6.

Let them be silent in the grave] Let their big-spoken mouths be stopped,
with a spade full of mould.

Verse. 18. Let the lying lips be put to silence] Heb. The lips of alye, (...)
artifices, as Jer. ^.3, 5. Among the Persians it was (...), held abase shame to
tell a lie. Oh that it were so among Christians! when shall that golden age
return, Herod, in Clio Xenoph. Cyrop. Strab. lib. 15.
that the argument may again proceed, Sacerdote^s;^, (...) fullet; Christianus
est, non mentietur, He is a Minister, he will not deceive; He is a
Christian, therefore he will not lie?

Which speek grievous things] Heb. An (...) thing; dara, and (...), durable and
long lasting (...) such as stick, and leaves scar, though the wound be (...).
Such mouths shall one day (...) for it, Jude. 15.

Proudly and contemptuously] Heb. In pride and contempt. It is Pride that
ca^^eth contempt of others. (...)

Verse. 19. Oh how great is thy goodnesse] The Prophet venteth himself by way of
exclamation, as finding it unspeakable; fitter to be believed, than possible to
be discoursed; words are too weak to utter it. What shall we say to these
things? quoth that great Apostle, Romans 8.31.

Which thon have laid up] Heb. Hidden. Besides that good which God works
openly for his before the sons of men, a great part of his wonderful kindness
is hidden from the world, and in part also from themselves, both in respect of
the fountain, 1 John 3.1, 2. Col. 3.3. the fulness, 1 Cor. 2.9. and the
inward sealing up thereunto, 1 Cor. 2.11, 12. Rev. 2.17. Prove. 14.10.

For them that fear thee -- that trust in thee] For faith must be actuated; and
when we have such a precious promise as this, we must suck and be satisfied,
Isa. 66.11. put on to get the goodness of God to work, which is done by
believing. Catch hold, as David did, 1 Chronicles. 17.23, 24, 25, 26. and make the
utmost of Gods loving kindness laid up in a promise; press it, and oppress
it, till the goodness be expressed out of these breasts of consolation.

Verse. 20. Thou shall hide them in the secret of thy presence] In the golden
cabinet of thy gracious providence, where they shall be as safe as if they
were in Heaven.

Thou shall keep them secretly in a Pavilion] A kind of speech taken from
Princes retiring-roomes, and withdrawing-chambers, which are sacred places.
Diodat^^


From the strife of tongues] From the Calumnies and contumelies of graceless
tongue-smiters. The Arabic renders it, from the insurrection of Tongues.
Sedition is first in the tongue and then in the hand; an unruly tongue sets
on fire, Jam. 3. But the Saints have a promise, that as no Weapon formed
against them shall prosper; so every tongue that rises against them in
judgment shall be condemned, Isa. 54.17.

Verse. 21. Blessed be the Lord] This should always be in a Christians mouth, as
Deo gratias was in Austines. He can never want matter, and should therefore
ever find an heart.

For he bath showed me his mavelous kindness] Mirificavit bonitatem suam,
has been far better to me than my hopes.

In a strong City] In Mahanaim, 2 Samuel 17.27. where it is likely he made this,
and some other Psalms.

Verse. 22. For I said in my haste, I am cut off, etc.] A frightful and sinful
saying doubtless, full of diffidence and despair. (See the like, Psalm. 116.11.
Job 9.16. Judge. 13.22. Psalm. 77.3. Joh. 2.4.) Thus he spoke when he tremblingly
fled, and was posting away.

Nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplication] A pitiful poor one
though it were, and full of infirmity. God considers whereof we are made; he
takes not advantages against his suppliants; it would be wide with them if he
should.

Verse. 23. O love the Lord] Let not your hasty discontent beget in you hard
thoughts of God, or heavy thoughts against your selves, as it has done in me;
but love him, trust him, and he will do you right.

And plentifully rewardeth] Heb. repaieth abundantly, or with surplussage, in
seipso vel in semine suo. It may be rendered, Upon the remainder, and understood
of the proud man's posterity, wherein God will be sure to bemeet with him.

Verse. 24. Be of good courage, etc.] Bear up, be stout, and steadfast in the
faith under trials. See Psalm. 27.14. with the Note. Thus good courage comes
not but from the true love of God. Verse. 23.

PSALM. XXXII.
A Psalm of David, Maschil] i.e. Giving instruction, or making prudent; for
David here, out of his own experience, turns Teacher, verse. 7. and the lesson
that he lays before his Disciples is the Doctrine of Justification by Faith,
that ground of true blessedness, Romans 4.6, 7. Docet igitur hic Psalmus vere
preciosus pracipuum and proprium fidei Christiana caput, says Beza, This most
precious Psalm instructs us in the chief and principal point of Christian
Religion, and it differs herein from the first Psalm, that there are set
forth the effects of Blessedness; but here, the cause; Quon^^do etians est
Paulus cum Jacobo conciliandus, says he.

Verse. 1. Blessed is be whose transgression is forgiven] The heavy burden of
whose trespasses is taken off, as the word imports, and he is loosed, cased,
and lightened. Sin is an intolerable burden, Isa. 1.3. such as presses down,
Heb. 12.1.2. burden it is to God, Am. 2.13. to Christ it was, when it made him
sweat water and blood; to the Angels, when it brake their backs, and sunk them
into Hell; to men, under whom the very earth groaneth, the Axeltree thereof is
even ready to crack, etc. it could not bear Corah and his company, it spewed
out the Canaanites, etc. O then the heaped up happiness of a justified person,
disburdened of his transgressions! The word here rendered transgression
signifies Treachery, and wickedness with a witness. Aben-Ezra faith, David
hereby intends his Sin with Bathsheba; and surely this Psalm, and the one and
fiftieth may seem to have been made upon the same occasion, they are tuned so
near together.

Whose sin is covered] As excrements and ordure are covered, that they may not
be an eyesore, or annoyance to any. Sin is an odious thing, the Devils
duivell, or vomit, the corruption of a dead soul, the filthiness of flesh and
spirit. Get a cover for it therefore ( sc. Christ's righteousness, called a
propitiation, or coverture, and raiment, Rev. 3.18.) Vt sic veletur, ne in
judicio reveletur, that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear.

Verse. 2. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity] Let no
man think this triplication of the same thing needless or superfluous; since
the poor soul afflicted with sense of sin and fear of wrath, is not easily
persuaded of pardon; but when faith would lay hold on the promise, Satan
rappeth her on the fingers, as it were, and seeks to beat her off. Besides, by
such an emphaticall repetition and heap of words to one purpose, the great
grace of God in pardoning men's sin, is plainly and plentifully declared and
celebrated; it being a mercy that no words, how wide soever, can sufficiently
set forth. By the word iniquity, some understand original sin, that peccatum
peccans, as the Schools call it, that (...) common cause and impure seminary
of all actual disobediences. Neither this, nor any of the fruits of it, does
the Lord impute, reckon count, or think to the pardoned finner, 2 Cor. 5.19.
Cui non cogitat peccatum, so some render it, To whom he thinks no sin, that
is, he reputeth or imputes it not for a sin he puts it not into the
reckoning, Isa. 43.25. and 48.9, 11. the Bill or Bond is cancelled Col. 2.14.
and there remains no action. Christ is our suerty, Heb. 7.22. Now the suerty
and debtour are in law reputed as one person. Christ is made sin for us, that
is, in our stead or place, that we might be made the righteousness of God in
him, 2 Cor. 5. ult.

And in whose spirit there is no guile] Sed sincere and sine dolo a suis
peccatis resipiscit, and ad Dei misericordiam se recipit. The justified are
also sanctified, 1 Cor. 6.11. they hide not their sins as Adam, thy neither
excuse nor extenuate what evils they have done, but think and speak the worst
of their sins, they lay load upon themselves, they hate Hy pocrisie and detest
dissimulation; it is a question whether they do more desire to be good, or
abhor to seem only to be so. B sil, as he commends that sentence of Plato,
that seeming sanctity is double iniquity; so he justly condemns that saying
of Euripides; I had rather seem to be good, than be so indeed. That maxim of
Machiavel is the same for sense, that virtue it self should not be sought
after, but only the appearance; because the credit is an help, the use a
cumber. The pardoned finner is sanctified throughout, washed not only from his
sin (the guilt and filth of it) but his swinish nature also (the love and
liking of it) he has no mind to return to his vomit, or wallowing in the mire,
says R. Solomon here; he says not Resipiscam and denuo peccabo, vel peccabo
and resipiscam, as R. David senseth it, I will repent, and then sin again; or
sin again, and then repent. This he knows to be incompatible with faith
unfeigned, and hope unfailable, 1 Timothy 1.5. 1 John 3.3.

Verse. 3. When I kept silence] i.e. Whilst I through guile of spirit (for this
leaven of Hypocrisy is more or less in the best hearts, though it sway not
there) concealed my sin, and kept the Devils counsel, contenting my self with
his anodines and false plasters. That old man slayer knows well, that as sin
is the souls sickness, so confession is the souls (...); and that there is
no way to purge the sick soul, but upwards. He therefore holds the lips
close, that the heart may not disburden it self. David by his persuasion, kept
silence for a while, but that he found was to his ruthe; and if he had held so,
it might have been to his ruin. Men, in pain of conscience, will shark for
ease, rather than sue for pardon; as the Prodigal first joined himself to a
Citizen, then ate husks, etc. before he would resolve to return. Satan had
first seduced David, and then gagged him, as it were, that he might keep
silence. But then God took him, and set him, upon the rack, where he roared
till he resolved to confess. And the like befell Bilney, Bainbam, Whittle, and
many other of the Martyrs, who having first yielded, could never be at rest
within themselves till they had publicly confessed their fault, and retracted
their subscriptions to those Popish Articles.

My bones waxed old] i.e. My strength wasted and wore away, I was in a
pitiful plight, per febrim for san, says an expositour, by a fever,
possibly, the fruit of his inward affliction. So bitter and burdensome is sin
cloaked, and close kept.

Through my rearing all the day long] Like a wild beast, Jun.
belluinos potius quam humanos gensitus and querimonias fudi, I rather roared
to the enfeebling of my body, than repented to the easing of my conscience. I
cried out for pain, but prayed not for pardon. As a Lion in a snare roareth, as
a bird in a gin fluttereth, so it fares with Hypocrites under Gods hand (and
with better men too sometimes, and for a season) but especially in pangs of
conscience, they bellow like bulls in a net, or swine, when a sticking; they
beat the air with many brutish roarings and ragings, which avail them no more
than if an Ox should break out of the slaughterhouse after the deadly blow
given him; the sting of conscience still remains.

Verse. 4. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon mee] See what God can do
when once he takes a man to do. Day and night he had sinned against God;
therefore day and night he suffers; and glad he may be that he so scapeth,
and is not forced to undergo an eternity of extremity. Some think that this
Psalm, and the sixth, were made much about a time; when David was newly
recovered of some grievous fit of sickness. It may be meant only of his inward
terrors, or chiefly at least; his body suffering by Sympathy, as having shared
in his sin.

My moisture is turned into the drought of Summer] My natural radical
moisture, that oil that maintains the lamp of life, is dried up and become
like a lump of clay; the vigor also and verdure of my soul is quelled and
consumed with the fire of thy fierce wrath. God will bring his best people to
this, if they put him to it; that they shall find it to be the greatest folly
in the World, to buy the sweetest sin at so dear a rate.

Selah] I speak it feelingly. Vat.
O quantum tormentum, etc. O aridum and exhaustuns me prae mastitia, etc. O my
pitiful condition!

Verse. 5. I acknowledged my sin unto thee] Though it were long first, yet thou
broughtest me to it. The soul is ready to hang her comforts on every hedge, to
shift and shark in every by-corner for comfort, rather than to repair to the
right fountain. Let should have escaped to the Mountains at first; but he
would needs to Zoar; which yet was soon too hot to hold him; David should have
acknowledged his sin ere this time; he should speedily have cast up the poison
he had swallowed down, before it got to the vitalls; but he had no mind to it,
till he had tasted of the whip, and then he agnized his sin unto the Lord, he
put himself into the hands of justice, in hope of mercy. The properties or
conditions of sound Confession are these, say the Schoolmen in this Tetrastich.

Sit simplex, humilis confessio, pura, fidelis,
Atque frequens, nuda and discreta, lubens, verecunda,
Integra, secreta, and lachrymabilis, accelerata,
Fortis, and accusans, and se punire parata.
And mine iniquity have I not hid] In confession we must show the Lord the
iniquity of our sin, the filthiness of our lewdness, the abomination of our
provocations, Romans 7.13. We must bring out our sins (as they took the Vessels
of the Sanctuary, Ezra. 8.34.) by number, and by weight; laying open how many
transgressions are wrapped up in our sins, and their circumstances. See for
this, Levit. 16.21.

I said, I will confess, etc. i.e. I resolved and purposed so to do; but (...)
that could be done, thou forgavest, etc. Gods ear was in David's heart, before
his confession could be in his tongue. So, at another time, he did but conceive
a purpose to build God an house, and God rewarded it with the building and
establishing of David's house, 2 Samuel 7.

And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin] The sting and stain of it, the
criminal and penal part ofit, Vel peccatum peccati, Uti^ur duobus vocabulis
ad aggravandum peccatum suum. Kimchi. As we say, terra pulveris, or (...) luti.
the worst thing that was in it; not the fire only, but the filth that was in
it; reserving still to thy self a power of fatherly corrections, and medicinal
miseries. But the iniquity of sin is wiped off by the sponge of true
confession. Homo agnoscit, Deus ignoscit. Man no sooner acknowledges the debt,
but God crosses the Book. It is therefore good counsel that a Father gives,
Fac confitendo propitium, quem tacendo non facis nescium, Confess and find
mercy; since by a senseless silence thou can not keep thy sins from Gods
knowledge of them. Let out that bad blood by opening a vein, that good health
may enter.

Per misereremti, tollitur ira Dei. Wot you what? (said Henry the eighth to the
Duke of Suffolk concerning Step^en Gardener when he had confessed his Popery,
for which he should have been the morrow after sent to the Tower) he has
confessed himself as guilty in this matter as his man, Act. and Mon. fol. 1177.
and has with much sorrow and pensiveness sued for my pardon. And you know
what my nature and custom has been in such cases, evermore to pardon them
that will not dissemble, but confess their fault, etc.

Selah] q. d. I speak it joyfully, there being no such matter of mirth in all
the World, as the sweet sense of forgiveness of sin. O singularem (inquit
David hic) Dei erga homines peccata sua agnoscentes gratiam and benevolentiam!

Verse. 6. For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee] For this, that
thou have so graciously done for me, the godly shall gladly perform these two
duties; the prayer of faith, and the obedience of faith. As I have been an
example to them of sin (which is now my grief) so I shall be to them of good,
and that is my comfort. Where note first, That every godly man is a praying man.
God has no dumb children in his house. Secondly, That such will be making use
of Gods dealing with others for their own instruction and comfort, For this.
Thirdly, That they will observe the fittest times to make their addresses to
God; as Courtiers watch their -- mollissima fandi Tempora

In a time when thou may be found] i.e. In a time of need, say some, Psalm.
50.15. Or, in a time of favor (as the Chaldee here has it) Isa. 53.6. before
the decree bring forth, Zepb. 2.2. before the drawbridge be taken up, the day
of grace be expired, Joh. 7.34. and 8.21. Heb. 6.6. Luke 13.29.

Surely in the floods of great Waters] In the greatest of outward troubles, or
inward perplexities.

They shall not come nigh unto him] sc. To prejudice his eternal salvation;
freed he shall be, if not from the smart, yet from the hurt of personal
crosses; and for public calamities, he shall be delivered, if not from the
common destruction, yet from the common distraction. Washed he may be, as Paul
was in the shipwreck, but not drowned with those floods of great waters; be
they never so great, they are bounded. Besides, the godly man rescipiscit
antequam superveniant fluctus miseriarum, as R. Obad. here notes, repents
before those floods come upon him, and so redeemeth his own sorrows. For he
says thus,

Verse. 7. Thou art my hiding place, etc.] And therefore I being a pardoned
person, shall be in safety under thy wings, Psalm. 91. per to^um.

Thou shall preserve me from trouble] Either from it, or in it; that I be not
hurt by it. The godly, after one trouble must prepare for another; after one
deliverance expect another. A company comes, as she said.

Thou shall compass me about with songs] i.e. Plentifully furnish me with
matter of praise, ita ut latus Peana canam. And like as in a lottery at every
prize the trumpet sounds; so at every deliverance I will sing aloud to thy
glory. All my springs shall be in thee.

Verse. 8. I will instruct thee and teach thee, etc.] No disgrace is it then for
great men to be teachers of others. Here we have 2 Prince-preacher; such as was
also Solomon, George Prince of Anbals, and others.

I will guide thee with mine eye] i. e. With my careful inspection and
oversight. I will see that thou profit in godliness. The Chaldee has it, I
will counsel thee, and set mine eye upon thee for good. Thus Christ counseled
Peter with his eye, Luke 22.61. Ministers must watch over their peoples and see
that all go right. Hence they are called Seers, Superintendents, Bishops.

Verse. 9. Be ye not as the horse, or as the (...)] David having according to
the title Maschil promised to teach, uses this preface to bespeak attention:
Be not uncounseilable, irreclaimeable, such as Basil complains of, qui neque
Ad Evag. Epist. 10.
quid sit veruns sciun^, neque sustineut discers, who neither knew, not would
be taught what was true, and fit to be practiced. Of the Rhinoceros, some
write, that slain he may be, caught he cannot be. Others, that he is animal
an^^e (...), a most untameable creature; for if he be taken, he presently dies
of sullenness. Such spirits we meet with not a few, who yet would take it in
foul scorn to be reckoned horses, and Asses that have no understanding,
neither will be taught any. To these the Psalmist here says, No obst upesaite,
and obbrutescite ad exercitations Dai, etc. Be not as horse or mule, lest ye be
led thorough a fools Paradise into a true prison. Be not headlong, headstrong,
untameable, untractable, etc. The horse and mule are instanced, as well known
amongst the Jews; and used to be ridden on.

Which have no understanding] And yet the horse knows his owner, etc. Strange
things are reported of Bucephalus, and Julius Cesars great horse. Of the
Egpptian Mamalukes horses it is reported, that they were so docible, that at
certain signs or speeches of the rider, they would with their teeth reach him
up from the ground a lance, an arrow, or such like thing; and as if they had
known the enemy, Turk. hist. 529.
run upon him with open mouth, and lash at him with their heels; and had by
nature and custom learned not to be afraid of any thing.

Whese mouth must be held in with bit and bridle] Lest they kick and bite thee.
Ne morde^ noceatve (...) Jun.
Such is the mad Worlds wages and usage of the most faithful Preachers. B.
Ridley lamented it in his time, the great ones spurned privily against those
that went about most busily and whole^omely to cure their sore backs. Act. and
(...) 1616.
As for Latimers Lever, Bradford, Knox (says he) their tongues were so sharp,
they ripped in so deep to their galled backs, to let out the filthy matter,
that they could never abide them. Thus He, and much more concerning King Edward
the sixth his Courtiers. The words may be read thus, whose mouth, except it be
held with bit and bridle, they wilnot come nigh unto thee, that is, thou will
not be able to rule them. It is a good observation of a modern Divine, Not the
unruly colt only, but the horse that is broken, has a bitt and bridle also; So
even the godly need the bridle of the Law, n^ (...) excutiant, lest they cast
their rider.

Verse. 10. Many sorrows shall be to the wicked] This is David's Doctrine (his
life follows in the next verse) Many pains, or great smarts are for the
Wicked, etc. And as Luther says, Let him that can rightly distinguish betwixt
Law and Gospel, give thanks to God, and know himself to be a good Divine; so
say I, Let him that is firmly persuaded of this truth here delivered, know
himself to be a good proficient in Christ's School; for it is the principle of
all holy learning.

Verse. 11. Be glad in the Lord] Joy is the just (...) portion. A pardoned
sinner, as verse. 1, 2. is here called upon (in an use of consolation) to be as
merry as mirth can make him; for what should ayl such an once as we say of a
rich man. Viscaunt List in Henry the eighths time dyed for joy of an unspected
pardon. (...) what was that to Gods pardon of all fins?

PSALM. XXXIII.
Verse. 1. Rejoice in the Lord, O ye righteous] That is, O ye upright (...),
as it follows here, and as Psalm. 32.11. For as there he ended, so here he
begineth, calling upon the Saints to be cheerful; and indeed there is hardly
any duty more pressed in the Old and New Testamen, or less practiced. To
quicken them therefore to so necessary but ^^ch neglected a duty, this Psalm
(...) to be added to the former, purposely to excite us by many Arguments,
(...) whole lives to the (...) forth of Gods worthy praises. In which regard
(...) faith (...) Psalm; and if it were well practiced we might have a very
heaven here as because it is not, we lose very much of the comfort of our
lives. Only that cautionating counsel of Berward would not be forgotten, Laeti
s^^^, non securi; gaudentes in spiritu sancte^ sed vera caventes a ^ecidive;
Let us be cheerful, but not secure; and rejoice in the Holy Ghost, but take
heed we let not fall the watch of the Lord. Creed mibi res sev^ra est gaudium
verum, Believe me, true joy is a severe matter, said Seneca, We may better say
so of Spiritual joy, which he never tasted of, neither does any stranger meddle
with. And if Plato could tell the Musicians, Philosophers could tell how to be
merry without Music; much more may Gods people. Quid nobis cum Fabulis, cum
risu? says Bernard, What have we to do with carnal mirth, and jollity, etc? we
have Meat to eat, and Music to our Meat, that the World knows not of; let us
make us merry with it.

For praise is comely for the upright] For them, and for none but them; High
words are not fit for a fool, says Solomon. Laudari ab illaudato, to be
praised by a praiseless person, Seneca.
is no praise at all. That State in story would not approve of good words from
an evil mouth: no more does God, Psalm. 50.15, 16. Christ would not suffer the
Devil to confess him. Hypocrisy slurrieth all it touches. If a man should
sing a good Song with his voice, and play a bad one on his Instrument, it would
make but a black sanctis: Such is the praise of the unupright; who had better
therefore be silent, unless themselves were better, since they do not only lose
their labor, but commit sin. Displeasing service is double dishonor; and
dissembled sanctity, double iniquity.

Verse. 2. Praise the Lord with Harp] Or Cittern, Jubals invention, Genesis 4.21.
much used by David, and others of old under the Jewish Pedagogy, as an help to
devotion, as were also other Musical Instruments, here, and elsewhere
mentioned. Now it is otherwise: the best melody is to sing Psalms with grace in
our hearts; and for other Music, when Aristotle was asked what he thought of
it? he answered, Jouem nec canere neque cit haram pulsare, that Jupiter
regarded it not.

Verse. 3. Sing unto him a new Song] sc. upon every new emergent occasion. God
renews his Mercies not only every morning, but every moment; so thould we out
praises; every breath we draw should praise the Lord, Psalm. 150. ult. Does God
give comforts? praise him, and they shall be continued. Does he send Crosses?
praise him, and they shall be removed, says a Father; but in every thing (...)
thanks; and that not coldly and cursorily, but ardently, and with utmost
affection; for which cause this duty is so reiterated here, and pressed with
such forcible arguments in the following verses, as might work upon the very
stones almost; much more men, for whose sakes all this fair Fabric of the
World was erected.

Play skilfully (or lustily) with a loud noyfe] Make good Music, set all your
skill and might a work to magnify the Lord. It is not an easy matter to
praise God aright; it must be done Cord, ore, oper^, with the very best of the
best. Benefacite canendo, cuns jubilatione.

Verse 4. For the Word of the Lord is right.] Every Word of God is pure and
precious, Prove. 30.5. his Commandment holy, and just, and good, Romans 7.12. but
by Word here we are to understand Gods Counsel, and Decree concerning the
Creation and government of the World, which is unquestionably right, and
agreeable to sound reason, and therefore they are too blame that dislike of his
doings. If any evil befall them, the Saints confess Gods righteousness and
praise him as Isa. 12.1. Psa. 10.1. faith Kimchi here.

And all his works are done in truth (...), In faith; that is in
faithfulness, without deceit or fickleness. This is to be understood of the
execution of Gods decree; all is done well, and equitable.

Verse. 5. (...) loves righteousness and judgement] q. d. How can he do
otherwise than right whose nature is such, that he loves righteousness and
judgment, that is, (...)

(...)

Verse. (...) gave them a Being. Or, by his essential Word, Solo ipsius (...)
su and nutu.
which is his Son the second person in Trinity, Prove. 8.27. Joh. 1.3. Col.
1.16. Heb. 1.2.

And all the host of them] These are first mentioned, because the most
glorious of all the works of God, so Psalm. 19.1.

By the breath of his mouth] By his word and command. Or rather, by his Holy
Spirit, the third person in Trinity, inseparable from the other two, as well in
essence, as in operation. See Genesis 1.1, 2. with the Notes. It has been
elsewhere noted, that in Thebe, a Town of Egypt, they worshipped a God whom
they acknowledged to be immortal. But how painted they him? In the likeness
of a man blowing an egg out of his mouth; to signify, tha he made the round
World by his Word, and by the breath of his mouth, as here. Va^^o adds, that
in way of thank-fullnesse, Plut. de Isid^ and Osicid. Var. de re ruf^ l. 2.
cap. 1.
they dedicated a sheep to him, to be offered in Sacrifice. This Text was
commonly urged by the Ancients for the Trinity of persons in the Godhead; which
Olymphus an Arrian Bishop denying, was struck with three thunderbolts and
killed in a Bath.

Verse. 7. He gathers the waters of the Sea together] Confining them to their
concave, to the pit he dug for them. Ecce altera misericordia, says kimchi
here, Behold another mercy; without the which the earth would be inhabitable,
unlesseby fishes only; because the waters would cover the earth.

As an heap] This shows that the Sea is higher than the Earth. Sailors
observe, that their ships fly faster to the shore than from it, whereof what
other reason can be given but the height of the waters above the land?

He lays up the depth in store-houses] In his treasuries; that is, he
secretly hides them, and limiteth then to a certain place (that they overwhelm
not the earth) by his Almighty power, Jer. 5.22. Job 38.16. See there.

Verse. 8. Let all the earth fear the Lord] viz. For these stupendous works of
his, sufficient to strike an a we, into all creatures, of the divine Majesty,
Jer. 5.22. Tremble thou earth at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of
the God of Jacob, Psalm. 114.7.

Verse. 9. For he spoke, and it was done] So true is that saying, Dei dicere est
facere. And a great shame it is to men to disobey the great Creator; and not
rather to follow the example of the unreasonable and insensible creatures.

And it stood fast] The whole order of nature remains, as he set it: firm,
fast, and unmovable.

Verse. 10. The Lord brings the counsel of the heathen to noughi] i. e. He
counter-worketh the Devil and his imps, who would overturn and destroy the
fair order of nature, mingle heaven and earth together as it were, and soon
mar all. God frustrateth the counsels and attempts of such tumultuating
boutefeaus and trouble-States; and maugre their malice; preserves polities,
laws, judgments, and natural equity; without which mankind could not long
subsist. Who then would not fear thee, O King of Nations? for to thee does it
appertain, Jer. 10 7. Rev. 15.4.

Verse. 11. The counsel of the Lord of stands for ever] That counsel of his,
whereby he has decreed to maintain government amongst men, to relieve the
oppressed, to punish the Wicked, to uphold the Church, is firm and inviolable.
Divinum consilium dum devitatur, impletur; humana sapientia dum reluctatur,
comprehenditur, says Gregory. There is a council in Heaven will dash the
mould of all contrary counfells upon earth.

Verse. 12. Blessed is the Nation whose God is the Lord] viz. By special favor
and covenant. The preservation of the Church (which has so few friends on
earth, and so many enemies in earth and hell) is justly brought as an evident
argument of the divine providence, Christ stands upon Mount-Zion; and that
mountain shall be exalted above all mountains. The Church, as it is highest
in the favor of God, so it shall be set above all the World; and het enemies
shall be in that place that is fittest for them the lowest, the footstool of
Christ.

The people whom he has chosen] Some read it, The people which has chosen
Hims for their inheritance. It comes all to one. See Deuteronomy. 26.17, 18, 19.

Verse. 13. The Lord looks from Heaven] Ita r^spicit universos quasi singulas,
it (...) s^l^s. And this Doctrine of Gods particular providence is, fides
natinnum quarum Deus est Dominus, says Kimchi, taught in the Church only.

Verse. 14. From the place of his habitation he beholdeth] And this is a very
great condescension, since he humbles himself to behold things in Heaven, Psalm.
113.6, to look out of himself upon the Saints and Angels; how much more upon
the inhabitants of the earth?

Verse. 15. Unum pa^^ter acaliud, Kimchi.
He fashioneth their hearts alike] i. e. Ones as well as another. The Arabic
has it, Format sigillatim he fashioneth them severally one after another; and
not all souls together, as the Origenists, and some Jew-doctors held.

He considers all their works] Their hearts are not hid from him (since he
made them, as is said before) much less their works. These God considers,
and therefore men had need consider them, and turn their feet to his
Testimonies, Psalm. 119.59.

Verse. 16. There is no King saved by the multitude of an hoast] Witness
Sennacherib, Xerxes, Bajazet. Away then with Creature-confidence; it will be
the ruin of all that rest in it; whether it be in men, or means that they
trust. See Psalm. 62.9, 10. with the Notes.

A mighty man] Or, A Giant, Goliath for instance. As the most skillful swimmers
are often drowned; So here.

Verse. 17. Pausan.
An Horse is a vain thing] And yet a warlike creature, full of terror (See the
Note on Psalm. 32.9.) and so swift in service, that the Persians dedicated him
to the Sun. See Job 41.20. Prove. 21.31. With the Notes.

Verse. 18. Behold the eye of the Lord is on them that fear him] He looks
upon such with singular delight; not without sweet intimations of his singular
kindness, and care of their good.

Upon them that hope in his mercy] Here we have a description of that true
Church which God will never forsake; sc. It is a company of such as truly serve
God, and boast not of their merits; but possessing their souls in hope and
silence, wait for his mercy.

Verse. 19. To deliver their soul] Freedom from troubles He promises not; but
deliverance in due time he assures them; and support in the mean while, to
keep them alive in famine.

Verse. 20. Our soul waits for the Lord] i. e. Patiently tarrieth the Lords
leisure. We can both wait and want for a need.

Verse. 21. Our heart shall rejoice in him] We shall be sure of an happy issue
and event; but yet so as that we pray for it, as in the next words.

Verse. 22. Let thy mercy O Lord be upon us, according as we hope in thee] Not
that we would have no more mercy than we have trust; but we would show that our
trust is bottomed upon thy promises, and that we humbly expect the full
accomplishment of the same, in due time.

PSALM. XXXIV.
Verse. 1. A Psalm of David] An Alphabeticall Psalm, which David (newly
delivered from the Philistines, Semper in Ecelesia his Psalmus piis suit
commendatissimus. Moller.
who had taken him prisoner, and presented him to their King as a special
prize) composed with singular art; as fit to be committed to memory by all
godly people, who may here meet with many excellent lessons, and cordial
comforts.

When he changed his behaviour] Heb. gust um, hoc est gestum. This he did
(being put to his shifts) but not without sin, Lib. 3. Od. 11.
for he was splendide mendax (as Horace says of Hypermuestra) at the best;
neither can this dissimulation or officious lie of his be excused; as some have
by distinctions endeavored it, but in vain.

Before Abimelech] Or, Achish, King of Gath, 1 Samuel 21. for he was binomini^,
says Aben-Ezra; or else Abimelech, that is, Father-King was his title of
honor. As Augustus would be styled Pater Patria, the Father of his Country. R.
Solomon says that Abimelech was a common name to all the Philistin-Kings, as
Pharaoh to the Egyptian.

Who cast him one] For a mad man, 1 Samuel 21.15. wherein there was a sweet
providence of God, who can order our disorders to his own glory, and our good;
like as an Artificer with a crooked tool can make straight work; or as an
Apothecary of a poysonfull Viper can make a wholesome triacle.

And he departed] Into some parts of Judea, where he might repent of his sin
first (as Peter did when got into a corner) and then compile this Psalm of
thanksgiving to God, who had so graciously delivered him out of that hard and
hazardous condition, not only above, but against his desert.

Verse. 1. I will bless the Lord at all times] As not satisfied with any thing
I can do herein, at any time. The Saints have large hearts; and could bet eem
the Lord a great deal more service than they are able to perform. A certain
Martyr said at the stake, I am sorry that I am going to a place, where I shall
be ever receiving wages, and do no more work.

His praise shall continually be in my mouth] For this remarkable mercy
especially, which I will still be telling of, and speaking good of Gods name to
as many as I can possibly extend unto. This thankful man was worth his weight
in the gold of Ophir.

Verse. 2. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord] This holy gloriation is a
Christians duty not to be neglected. The Church in the Canticles is much in it;
and so is St. Paul. It shows an heart full of joys unspeakable, and full of
glory, 1 Pet. 1. 8. And besides, God is thereby greatly glorified, Jer. 9.23,
24.

The humble shall hear thereof, and be glad] Not for my sake only, but their
own; as conceiving good hope of like deliverance. But then they must be as I
am, not only humbled, but humble; low, but lowly.

Verse. 3. O magnify the Lord with mee] As not sufficient to do so great a work
himself, he calls in the help of others. We read of a Monster rather than a
man, who lying on his death bed, not only himself swore as fast and as
furiously as he could, but desperately desired the standers by to help him
with oaths, Boltons, Assize-serm.
and to swear for him. I knew the man, says mine Author. And should not we
much more call upon others to join their forces with ours in magnifying the
Lord? Birds, when they come to a full heap of corn, will chirp and call in for
their fellows. Charity is no churl; goodness is diffusive.

And let us exalt his name together] And so begin Heaven aforehand. Aben-Ezra
glosseth thus, Quasi diceret, Nos omnes simul ad laudandum Deum sumus
imbecilles, we are all too weak for this work, though we should all do our
utmost at it.

Verse. 4. I sought the Lord] Even when I was in the enemies hands, and playing
my pranks as a mad man amongst them; I prayed secretly and inwardly, I sent up
some ejaculations (as Nehem. 2.4.) and was heard, though unworthy.

And delivered me out of all my fears] Which were not a few, 1 Samuel 21.13.
besides his inward terrors upon his unwarrantable practices, to save his life.
Sense fights sore against faith, when it is upon its own dunghill (in a
sensible danger I mean) to the great disturbance of the conscience afterward.
George Marsh (afterward a Martyr in Queen Maryes days.) being examined before
the Earl of Derby, kept himself close in the Sacrament of the Altar, as they
called it. But afterward, thus he writes to a friend; I departed much more
troubled in my spirit than before; because I had not with more boldness
confessed Christ, but in such sort as mine adversaries thereby thought they
should prevail against me; whereat I was much grieved; for hitherto I went
about as much as in me lay, to rid my self out of their hands, if by any means
without open denying of Christ and his word, that could be done, etc. Thus He;
but no rest he had in his mind, Act. and Mon^ fol. 1419.
till he had better declared himself, though to the loss of his life. A man
had better offend all the World, than his own conscience. David, not without
much ado, recovered his peace, for which he here heartily blesses God.

Verse. 5. They looked unto him, and were lightened] They, that is, my servants
and fellow soldiers who accompanied me first to Nob, 1 Samuel 21.2, 4. Mat.
12.3, 4. and afterward to Gath (as it is probable) these being in the same
danger, looked likewise unto God by faith, hope, and prayer; and were
lightened; that is, comforted, cheared, directed, yea delivered together with
David. Or, They flowed together, viz. to God, as Rivers roll to the Sea, or
malefactors run to the sanctuary, Isa. 2.2, and 60.5.

And their faces were not ashamed] i.e. They were not repulsed, disappointed,
made to hide their heads, as Rev. 6.15, 16.

Verse. 6. This peer man cried] Meaning himself, to whom it seems he pointed
the finger, or laid his hand on his heart, when he said, This poor man, Hic
vilis, et evium Pastor, says Theoderet, this mean Shepherd not long since; but
rather, This miserable sinner, who whilome rashly ran such an hazard, and so
unworthily deported himself in the presence of King Achish; this poor Soul, I
say, cried, but silently and secretly, as Moses did at the red Sea, as Nehemiah
did in the presence of the King of Persia.

And the Lord] Who might better be called the poor man's King, than was James 4.
King of Scotland.

Heard him, and delivered him out of all his troubles] And the like he will do
for all that in like case, being poor in spirit, make their humble addresses
unto him. It is good to communicate unto others our experiences. See the like
done, Psalm. 116.6. Romans 8.2. 1 Timothy 1.15.

Verse. 7. The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about, etc.] Not one
Guardian-Angel only (as some have hence conceited) nor Michael the Archangel
only, that Angel of the Covenant, Jesus Christ, as Augustine expounds this
Text, but an Host of created Angels, those ministering Spirits, sent forth to
minister for them who shall be heirs of Salvation, Heb. 1.14. For although
Christ the Captain of our Salvation needs not their help, for the safeguard
of his people; yet for our comfort he makes use of the holy Angels, who meet
us still, as they did Jacob at Mahanaim (where they made a lane for him, as the
Guard does for their Prince, as the word imports) Genesis 32.1. they minister
many blessings to us, though invisibly; stand at our right hands, Luke 1.11. as
ready to releeve us, as the Devils are to mischief us, Sicut hosts sunt in
circuitu, Kimchi.
Zech. 3.1. yea they pitch Camp round about us, as here (Oh the dignity and
safety of a Saint in this respect!) fight in battel-array against our enemies,
Dan. 10.20. (the Heathens speak much of their Castor and Pollux fighting for
them; and H^siod tells of thirty thousand demy-gods that were (...) Keepers
of Mankind) and convey them at death, as they did Lazarus, through the enemies
Country, the air, into Abraham's bosom, Luke 16.

Verse. 8. O taste and see, etc.] Viz. with the mouth of your mind, and with
the eyes of your faith perceive, and experiment the goodness of God in choosing,
and using such Instruments as the Angels, and otherwise, in the manifold
expressions of his love to us; wherein if we take not comfort, the fault is
merely in our selves; we being like him who has pleasant and nourishing meat,
but will not make use of it. The Saints taste how good the Lord is, and thence
long after him. Optima demonstratio est a sensibus; as he that feels Fire hot,
or as he that tastes Honey sweet, ye need not use arguments to persuade him to
believe it: So here, let a man but once taste that the Lord is good, and he
will thenceforth, as a new born Babe, desire the sincere Milk of the Word, 1
Pet. 2.2, 3. neither will he take any more content in the Worlds tastless
fooleries, than in the white of an Egg, or a dry chip. D. 4. dom.
Gustato spiritu desipit omnis caro, says Gerson, All flesh is savourless to
him that has tasted of the Spirit. Paul, after his Rapture, looked with scorn
and pity on all the Worlds glittering Poverty. His mouth does not water after
homely provisions, who has lately tasted of delicate sustenance. O let us get
Spiritual senses, habitually bitually exercised to discern good and evil, Heb.
5. ult. It is the Spirit that quickneth, the flesh profits nothing, says our
Savior to the Jews, q.d. ye accept not my words, because ye have not the
Spirit, ye have but flesh, that is, a common knowledge, no sound taste; and
therefore it is that my words relish not with you.

Blessed is the man, etc.] See Psalm. 2.12. with the Notes.

Verse. 9. (...) quasi (...)
O fear the Lord ye his Saints] Ye that having tasted of Gods sweetness, are
separated from the World, with its lusts, and can live with a little; Fear the
Lord, and then you shall not need to fear want of any thing; for he is
Allsufficient to those who are altogether his, and withdraw not from him by
mistrust, or misdoing.

For there is no want to them that fear him] Habent omnia, qui habent habentem
omnia. David, when captive among the Philistines, wanted not. Paul had nothing,
and yet possessed all things. Contrarily, the wicked, in the fullness of his
sufficiency is in straights, Job 20, 22.

Verse. 10. The young Lions do lack and suffer hunger] And yet they will have
it, if it be to be had. H etc est sceleratorum imago, says Beza. Lion-like
wicked oppressors, rich Cormorants (as the Septuagint render it) who live on
the spoil of poor people, and are never satisfied, do yet perish with famine
(as Eliphaz says of the old Lion, Job 4.11.) and come ost to great poverty; so
that they pine away, Donec mis^ tabeseant. Beza.
and miserably perish.

But they that seek the Lord] That, content with his blessing alone, seek not
their nourishment any other way but from his hand, and will rather lie in the
dust, than rise by evil Principles; these have an autarkie, a self-sufficiency,
such as godliness is never without, 1 Timothy 6.6. Some Rabbis say, Aben-Ezra Loc.
that the servants of Achish had almost famished David (under pretense happily of
reducing him to his right mind) but God sustained him by Miracle, as he did
Elias, 1 King. 17.

Shall not want any good thing] Want they may, this or that, which they may
think would be good for them: but God knows it to be otherwise; or else they
should be sure of it. Of good nothing follows of it self but good, but if by
accident any evil follows, yet it is turned into good to such as seek the
Lord in sincerity.

Verse. 11. Come ye children, hearken unto me] Ye that are little, and low in
your own eyes, as seeing your want of holy Learning.

I will teach you the fear of the Lord] That best Trade, whereby you shall be
sure to be kept from want; for by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches,
and honor, and life, Prove. 22.4. He then who shall teach this fear should be
honored, and respected as a Father. The Jews at this day account a man's
Master, or Tutor worthy of more respect than his Father: for he has given him
only his being, Leo Modena^
the other his wel-being.

Verse. 12. What man is he that desires life] This is David's Doctrine; and to
draw company about him, he proclaims and promises that which he well knew
every man coveteth, happy life, many days, and a comfortable enjoyment of all.
Now, who is it that would have these, says he? Austine brings in all sorts,
saying, Ego and ego, I would, and I would. But as all men desire health, but
few take a right course to get it, and keep it; so all would be happy, but few
hearken to this wholesome counsel, for the compassing of true happiness.

Verse. 13. Keep thy tongue from evil, etc.] This is an hard saying, think the
most; who will therefore rather venture it than yield to be so tied up. The
Tongue is an unruly member, and can hardly be hampered. But who would not
temper his tongue, and bind it to the good abearance, for true blessedness? Who
would not rather bite it off, and spit it out (as that ancient Martyr did his,
into the face of the Tyrant, who solicited him to deny Christ) than miss of
Heaven? Ficinus after his Tracts De sanitate tuenda, of keeping good health;
and another, of recovering health; and a third, of prolonging life; because all
will not do, wisely adds a fourth; Of laying hold on eternal life; which
cannot be done, but by mortifying this earthly member, a loose and lewd tongue.
For by thy words thou shall be justified, and by thy words thou shall be
condemned, says the Judge himself, Mat. 12.37. Compare Genesis 49.21. with Deuteronomy.
33.23. and it will appear that good words ingratiate with God and Men.

Verse. 14. Depart from evil, and do good] For negative goodness helps not. A
man must so abstain from evil, as that he do good, or he does nothing. It is
said of Ithacius, that the hatred of the Priscillian Heresy was the best that
could be said of him; this was but a slender commendation.

Seek peace and pursue it] As Hunters do the prey. If it fly from thee, make
after it; it will pay thee for thy pains. It is said of Frederick the Third,
Emperor, that by putting up many injuries, he reigned quietly fifty and three
years, and five months. He had need be patient that would be at peace. Vt
habeas quietum tempus, Val. Max. Christian. 30 Augustine.
perde aliquid, was a Proverb at Carthage; not unlike that of ours, Do any
thing for a quiet life. Concedamus de jure ut careamus lite. And if, in this
pursuit of peace, thou meet with many rubs and remoraes, yet be not
discouraged, considering what follows in the two next verses.

Verse. 15. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous] He sees and weighs
the wrongs they sustain for peace sake, and they shall be no losers thereby;
provided that their pursuit of peace proceed from the filial fear of God,
which David here professes to teach, Verse. 11. Gods eyes are intent, his ears
attent to these righteous ones. Palam, clam (as Aben-Ezra here) openly,
secretly, he will right them and recompense them. Should not God see, as well
as hear (says another) his children should want many things. We apprehend not
all our own wants, and so cannot pray for relief of all. He (of his own accord
without any monitor) is wont to aid us.

And his ears are open to their cry] Heb. Are to their cry. Or, (as St. Peter
has it) His ears are into their prayers; 1 Pet. 3^
to show, that though their prayers are so faint and feeble that they cannot
enter into the ears of the Lord of Hoasts, yet that he will bow down and
incline his ears unto, nay into their prayers, their breathings, Lam. 3.56.

Verse. 16. The face of the Lord is against them that do evill] Let not such
dream of a long and happy life, as Verse. 12. This they are apt to do; but shall
be carried from a fools Paradise to a true prison. For that people may not
imagine God to be (...), and so made up of mercy, as to forget his judgments,
the Wicked are here affured, that the face of the Lord is against them, that he
beholds them from Heaven with a terrible countenance, that he is grievously
angry with them, and will surely and severely punish them; and theirs after
them.

To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth] And so to cross them in
the thing that they most coveted, viz. to renown themselves amongst men. God
writes them in the earth (in opposition to those, whose names are written in
Heaven, Luke 10.) because they forsook the Lord the fountain of living waters,
Jer. 17.13.

Verse. 17. The Righteous cry, etc.] This is often inculcated for our better
assurance; because we are apt to doubt, if delayed. See verse. 6.

Verse. 18. The Lord is nigh unto them, etc.] More nigh than the bark is to the
Tree, for he is with them, and in them continually; pouring the oil of his
grace into these broken vessels, quorum corda pecc at a little non amplius
retinent, sed, ut vas fractum, effundunt, faith Aben-Ezra here, whose hearts
retain not their sins any longer, but pour them out as water before the Lord.

And saves such as be of a contrite spirit] Such as are ground to powder, as
it were, with sense of sin, and fear of wrath; yet not without good hope of
mercy. These God delivers out of their dangers; and in fine brings them to
eternal blessedness.

Verse. 19. Many are the troubles, etc.] Dei sunt nuntii, these are Gods
messengers, faith Kimchi; and they seldom come single. See Jam. 1.2. with the
Note. Sent they are also to the Wicked, Psalm. 32.10. but on another errand, and
for another end. The Righteous per angust a ad augustum, per spinas ad rosas,
per motum ad quietem, per procell as ad portum, per crucem ad coelum
contendunt, through many tribulations they enter into Gods Kingdom. Not so the
Wicked; their crosses are but a typical Hell.

But the Lord delivers him out of them all] No Country has more venomous
Creatures, none more Antidotes than Egypt; so godliness has many troubles,
and as many helps against trouble.

Verse. 20. He keeps all his bones] Which are very many. Perhaps (says
AbenEzra here) David had been scourged by the Philistines, but his bones were
not broken; nor were our Saviors, Joh. 19.36.

Verse. 21. Evil shall slay the Wicked] For lack of such deliverance, as verse.
19. malum jugulat au thorem mali. Their malice shall prove their mischief. The
Arabic has it (but not right) mors impii pessima. Aben-Ezra better senseth it
thus, One affliction kills the Wicked; when out of many, God delivers the
Righteous.

Verse. 22. The Lord redeemeth the souls of his servants] Though to themselves
and others they may seem helpless and hopeless, yet they shall not perish in
(...) fins, and for their sins, as do the Wicked.

PSALM. XXXV.
Verse. 1. Plead my cause, O Lord] We may safely pray the same, when oppressed
with calumnies, and false accusations, as now David was by Saul's Sycophants, or
(as others think) when he was in great heaviness, and even heart-sick; after
that Amnon had defiled Tamar, and Absalom had slain Amnon; his disaffected
subjects, such as Shimei, insulted over him, and said, it was just upon him for
the matter of Uriah, and other miscarriages; which they wrongfully charged him
with. See a promise in this case, Isa. 49.21.

Fight against them, etc.] Or, devour them that devour me; for in Niphal
only it signifies to fight.

Verse. 2. Take hold of shield and buckler] Jehovab is a man of war, Exodus 15.5.
and so he is here stirred up to harness himself: Not that he needs weapons
defensive, as here, or offensive, as verse. 3. for he can destroy his enemies,
sole nutu ac flatu, with a nod, or a blast: But this is spoken after the manner
of men, and for our better apprehension of Gods readiness to relieve his
distressed ones.

Verse. 3. Draw out also the spear] viz. That thy contending and appearing for
me, may appear to be sufficient and glorious.

And stop the way] Heb. And stop, viz. the doors, as Genesis 19.6, 10. and 2
King. 6.32. lest the malcontents come in and kill me. Or, shut me up from my
persecutors, that they find me not; like as afterward, God hid Jeremy and
Baruch, when sought for to the slaughter.

Say unto my soul I am thy salvation] Facito ut haec animula te sibi test antem
audiat, etc. Inwardly persuade my heart to firm affiance in thee, amidst all
mine afflictions.

Verse. 4. Let them be confounded and put to shame] Here David begins his
imprecations; which yet non maledicens dixit sed vaticinantis more praedixit,
says Theodoret, he does not utter as cursing, but as prophesying rather. If we
shall at any time take upon us thus to imprecate (as we may in some cases) we
must see to it, first that our cause be good. Secondly, that we do it not out
of private revenge; but merely for the glory of God. Thirdly, ut ne voculam
quidem nisinobis praeunte Dei, non carnis, spiritu effundamus, that we utter
not a syllable this way, but by the guidance of Gods good Spirit.

Verse. 5. Let them be as chaffe] Facti sint a cord su^ fugitivi, Let them fly
before their own consciences, restless and uncertain whither to turn
themselves.

And let the Angel of the Lord chase them] It may be understood both of the
evil Angels, and of the good; ready at Gods command to do execution upon his
enemies. Chafe driven before the wind may rest against a wall; but where shall
they rest who are chased by an Angel? where shall the ungodly and the sinner
appear, 1 Pet. 4.18? Surely no where.

Verse. 6. Let their way be dark and slippery] Heb. Darkness and slipperinesse.
If a man have neither light, nor firm footing, and a feirce enemy at his
heels, See Jer. 23.1^
what shift can he make for himself? The word rendered slippery is of a double
form (like that libbi secharchar, my heart pants or beats about, throbbeth,
Psalm. 38.10.) to increase the signification. The soul of a wicked man is as in
a sling, 1 Samuel 25.29. violently tossed about.

Verse. 7. For without cause have they hid for me, etc.] The Wicked are so
acted and agitated by the Devil their task-master, that though they have no
cause to work mischief to the Saints, yet they must do it; the old enmity, Genesis
3. still works: But this renders their destruction certiorem and celeriorem,
more sure and more swift.

Verse. 8. Let destruction come upon him at unawars] i.e. Upon the whole rabble
of them, as if they were all but one man. Or, else he strikes at some
chieftain amongst them. Let his destruction be as sudden as signal.

Verse. 9. And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord] This was that he aimed at
in his foregoing imprecations, viz. the glory and praise of God, and not his
own reaking his teen upon his enemies.

Verse. 10. All my bones shall say Lord, who is like unto thee?] Not my soul
only, but my body also shall join in this joyful acclamation; yea my bones
shall say, etc. that is, whatsoever strength and vigor is in me, it shall be
spent in celebrating thy praises. Or, although I have nothing left me but skin
and bones, so poor am I grown, yet I will not be wanting to the work.

Verse. 11. False witnesses did rise up] So they did afterward against the Lord
Christ, and sundry of his faithful servants, as St. Paul, Athanasius,
Enstathius Bishop of Antioch, Alsted. Chronol. Act. and Mon.
(falsely accused of Adultery, and deposed, about the end of Constantine the
great's reign) Cranmer charged with Adultery, heresy and treason; Philpot with
paricide; Latimer with sedition; whereof he was so innocent, that he feared not
to say in a Sermon before the King, as for sedition, for ought that I know,
methinks I should not need Christ, if I may so say.

They laid to my charge things that I knew not] Such as whereof I was not only
innocent, but ignorant also. The Hebrew is, They asked me, and so would have,
by cunningly contrived questions, made me mine own accuser.

Verse. 12. They rewarded me evil for good] To render good for evil is
divine; good for good is humane; evil for evil is brutish; but evil for good
is devilish.

To the spoiling of my soul] i.e. Intentant caedem. Kimchi.
To the depriving me of that life which I have so often hazarded, to save
theirs. Or, this their devilish dealing with me, erat mihi quasi mors amarum,
was as bitter as death to me.

Verse. 13. But as for me, when they were sick] i.e. Any way afflicted, when
they ayled any thing.

My clothing was sackcloath] I put my self in mourners habit; Incedebam
atratus, to testify my good affection to ward them.

I humbled my soul with fasting] In die designato, in a solemn day set apart
for the purpose; Kimchi. De Elia and jejunio cap. 8.
as the a with a pathach shows. Jejunium est humilit as mentis, miserationis
expensa, charit at is illecebra, allevamentum infirmitatis, alimentum salut is,
says Ambrose, Fasting is the affliction of the soul, the cost of compassion,
etc.

And my prayer returned into mine own bosome] i. e. Though they had no benefit
by it, yet my self had; 2 Samuel 1.22.
for no faithful prayer is ineffectuall; like Jonathans bow, it never
returns empty. I received the fruit of my prayers for them upon my bosom.

Verse. 14. I behaved my self as though he had been, etc.] My Brother a thousand
times. This was much to do to an enemy; but possibly all this might be before
they fell out.

I bowed down heavily, as one that mourns, etc.] The Mother is usually most
dearly-beloved, and not without cause; as having been ante partum onerosa, in
part^ dolorosa, post partum laboriosa. Kimchi.
Or, as a suckling cries in the loss of his Nurse.

Verse. 15. Morbus est sic dictus quia incedere nequit nisi cum dolor quasi
claudicando. Aben-Ezra. Dum illum ride^, pene factus sum ille. Epist. 9. lib. 2.
But in mine adversity] Heb. In my halting; when through weakness I could not
but halt before my best friends, as we say.

Yea the abjects gathered themselves together] Claudi congregati sunt, and
secundum claudicationem meam claudicabant, ut me deriderent, So the Syriack
senseth it. They halted as I did, by way of derision; but they should have
known, first, that mocking is catching, as we say; Tully confesses, that
whiles he laughed at one Hircus a very ridiculous man, he became as bad almost
himself. Secondly, That such cruel mockings, are grievous sins, and such as
God severely punishes. Some render it the Smiters, that is, the
tongue-smiters, as Jer. 18.18. Others, the smitten, that is, the abjects, the
vile persons; the basest can mock, as did Tobiah the Servant, Neh. 2.19. and
those Pests, Psalm. 1.1.

And I knew it not] Or, Such as I knew not, took no notice of, they were so
base; See the like, Job 30.8.

They did tear mee] sc. With their tongues, as dogs toss and tear carrion
with their teeth, Scindunt illud quod reparare nequeunt, non per poenitentiam,
says Kimchi. They tear that which they cannot make good again, no not by
repentance, viz. my good name. Or. they rent, sc. their garments, as if they
had been very sorry for me, as Genesis 37.34. Job 2.12. This they did, as Austin
speaks, simulatione miseriae, non compassione misericordiae, out of deep
dissimulation.

Verse. 16. With Hypocritical mockers in feasts] Cum sannionibus placentae
v^lcibi, with hypocritical mockers for a cake, or dainties; there is an
elegancy in the origiginall (which shows it to be proverbiall) and cannot be
englished. R. Solomon tells us here, that they who delighted in flatteries,
gave their flatterers cakes baked with honey, to make them the more to flatter
them. Solomon tells of some that will transgress for a piece or bread, Prove.
28.21. So those parasiticall Prophets, Mensarii scur^^^.
Ezekiel. 13.19. Or, I am made their table-talk, as Hos: 7.8. scornfully deriding
me at their feasts, and in their cups.

Verse. 17. Lord how long will thou look on] i.e. carry thy self as a Spectator
of my miseries, and a tolerator of mine enemies, those architects of mine
afflictions.

Rescue my soul from their destructions] i. e. Their snares and ambushes,
whereby they seek to destroy me.

My darling from the Lions] See the Note on Psalm. 22.20.

Verse. 18. I will give thee thanks in the great Congregation] For examples sake
to others; for Magnates magnetes. Acts 18.8. when Crispus the chief Ruler of
the Synagogue believed, many of the Corinthians believed also. Great men are
the Looking-glasses of the Country, according to which most men dress
themselves: many eyes are upon them; they had need therefore to be exact, for
they are sure to be exemplary.

Verse. 19. Neither let them wink with the eye] Which is the gesture of a
malicious Scoffer, Prove. 6.13. and 10.10. Ne amarulenter Ludificentur me. Trem:


Verse. 20. For they speak not peace] Which yet God does to his people, Psa.
85.9. and that is their comfort; I am for peace, says David elsewhere, but
when I speak of it, they are for war, Psalm. 120.7.

Against the quiet of the Land] i.e. Against my self, and such as I am, who
study to be quiet, and to do our own business, 1 These. 4.11. affecting rather
quietness from the World, than acquaintance with it.

Verse. 21. They opened their mouth] As if the very banks of blasphemy had been
broken down.

Our eye bath seen] Eye for eyes, unless we would say that all the wicked are
so conjoined, that they may seem to have but one Eye, Heart, Head, etc. and
then they say as Hannibal did, when he saw a ditch full of man's blood, O
formosum spectaculum! O gallant fight! O rem regiam, as Valesus said, when he
had slain three hundred Protestants.

Verse. 22. This thou have seen, O Lord] This answers to that before, verse.
21. Our eye has seen it, as Aben-Ezra observes. So does

Keep not silence] To that, they opened their mouth wide against me. Ibid.

Verse. 23. Stir up thy self, and awake] This is the same in effect with the
beginning of the Psalm; to show his ardour and intention of affection.

Verse. 24. According to thy righteousness] i.e. for the honor of thy Justice,
wherein else thou art likely to suffer.

And let them not rejoice over me] For I quarter Arms, as I may so say, with
thee, Lord; and my disgrace will reflect upon thee.

Verse. 25. Ah, so would we have^t] Heb. Ah, ah, our soul; that is, our desire:
we are voti compotes.

We have swallowed him up] As Swine do swill, or ravenous beasts their prey.

Verse. 26. Let them be ashamed, etc.] They shall so: and this prayer against
the Churches enemies shall still speak effectually.

Verse. 27. Let them shout for joy, etc.] He concludes with hearty prayer for
the Church, as he does in diverse other Psalms.

That favor my righteous cause] Though perhaps they dare do no more than
inwardly favor it, and by their prayers to God promote it.

Let them say continually, etc.] Let them have continual cause to praise God
for this sweet property, that he delights in his peoples prosperity, and
afflicts them not from his heart, nor grieveth the Children of men, but for
their greatest good, Lam. 3.35.

Verse. 28. And my tongue, etc.] I do solemnly promise that thy praises shall
never dye on my hand, etc.

PSALM. XXXVI.
A Psalm of David the Servant of the Lord] See Psalm. 18. title. Then he had
well-nigh finished his Ruledom, here he is about to begin it, and therefore
assumeth this title. Serum est nomen officii, Servant is a name of Office or
Duty. Tertullian faith of Augustus (we may better of David] Gratius ei fuit
nomen pietatis, quam potestatis, he took more pleasure in names of duty than of
dignity; so those heavenly Courtiers rejoice rather to be styled Angels, that
is, Messengers, and Ministering Spirits, than Thrones, Principalities, Powers,
etc.

Verse. 1. Hieron. Vulgata.
The transgression of the wicked says within my heart] Some say it is libbi for
libbo, Jod for Van, and render it within (or in the midst of) his own heart;
and so make it the same in sense with Psalm. 14.1. but these make too bold with
the text. David, that zealous Servant of God, was fully persuaded of, and
deeply affected with, the profligate wickedness of some graceless persons (such
as were Saul, and his bloud-sucking Sycophants) that they were stark Atheists,
and had not the least spark of common goodness left in them; that they had
neither the fear of God, nor shame of the World to reign them in from any
outrage. This is mine opinion of them, says David, I am strongly so conceited,
and I will give you my grounds. I speak as to wise men: judge ye what I say.

Verse. 2. For he flattereth himself in his own eyes] This is the first proof of
the foregoing charge, and the fountain of all the following exorbitancies. See
the like, 2 Timothy 3.2. there self-love brings all out of order: here
self-flattery. Sibi palpum obtrudit, he stroketh himself on the head, and
says, I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of mine heart, to
add drunkenness to thirst; and rebellion to sin, Deuteronomy. 29.19. Thus he sootheth
and smootheth up himself, neither shall any one persuade him but that his penny
is as good silver as the best of them all. Thus he calls evil good, and good
evil; and proudly bolstering of himself in his sinful practices, he makes a
bridge of his own shadow, and so falls into the ditch of destruction.

Until his iniquity be found to be hateful] Till God by his Judgments uncase
him, and men out of utter hatred of his execrable practices, tell him his own
to his teeth. Thus Stephen Gardener being charged of cruelty by Mr. Bradford,
answered in open Court, I for my part have been challenged for being too gentle
often times, which thing Bonner confirmed, and so did almost all the audience,
that he had ever been too mild and moderate. But Doctor Taylour told him
another tale, Act. and Mon. 1461. Ibid. 1380.
when he said to him, How dare you for shame look me or any Christian man in
the face, seeing you have forsaken the truth, denied our Savior Christ, done
contrary to your Oath? etc. So Bonner, They report me, said he, to the Lord
Mayor, to seek blood, and call me Bloody Bonner; whereas God knows I never
sought any man's blood in all my life. To whom Mr. Smith the Martyr answered,
Why my Lord, Ibid. 1537.
do you put on this fair visor before my Lord Mayor, to make him believe that
you seek not my blood, to cloak your Murders through my stoutness, as you call
it? Have you not had my brother Tomkins before you, whose hand when you had
burnt most cruelly, you burnt his whole body: and not only of him, but of a
great many of Christ's Members, etc? So upon the Martyrdom of Master Philpot, a
certain unknown good woman in a Letter to Bonner wrote thus; Indeed you are
called the common Cutthroat, and general slaughterssave to all the Bishops of
England; and therefore it is wisdom for me and all other simple sheep of the
Lord to keep us out of your butcherly stall, as long as we can, especially
since you have such store already that you are not able to drink all their
blood, lest you should break your belly; and therefore you let them lie still,
and dye for hunger, Ibid. 1672.
etc. And soon after, you have broken a Pot indeed (Mr. Philpot) but the
precious Word contained therein is so notably therewithal shed abroad, that
the sweet savor thereof has wonderfully well refreshed all the true
Household, or Congregation of Christ, that they cannot abide any more the
stinking savor of your filthy ware, that came from the dunghill of Rome, though
your Lordships Judasses set them to sale every where to fill up your Baggs,
etc. Thus these bloud-suckers stunk above ground, and it is probable that the
Saints shall look upon such in the next World, throughout all eternity, with
execrable and everlasting detestation.

Verse. 3. The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit] That is, says
Calvin, he has something to say to excuse and justify himself, to the
hardening of his heart, and hastening of his destruction; as there is no Wool
so coarse but will take some color. But God will one day wash off his varnish
with rivers of Brimstone; he can skill of none other Language but that of
Hell; the words of his mouth are, desiderium and dolus; there is no truth, and
as little trust to be put in any thing that he speaks. And why? there is no
fear of God before his eyes. See a like Text, Romans 3.13, 14, 15.

He has left off to be wise, and to do good] That little light he once had, he
has lost, and cast off such good practices as once in hypocrisy he performed;
neither will he learn to do better. Dicit reprobos fugitare rationem been
agendi, ne vitam suam in melius corrigere cogantur, says Vatablus.

Verse. 4. He devises mischief upon his bed] He bends his wits and beats
his brains, perdius and pernox, breaking his sleep to plot and plow, to
contrive and effect mischief. Vanity, or villainy is his whole study. He is
always either weaving spiders webs, or batching Cockatrices eggs.

He sets himself in a may that is not good] And there means to keep him,
as the word imports; set he is, and he will not be removed, being every whit
as good as ever he means to be. Statuit se; there you left him, and there you
may find him, for he is no changeling; and that is a piece of his silly glory.

He abhors not evill] Sed studio sissime amplectitur, Jun.
but does wickedly with hands earnestly, and takes long strides toward Hell
(which is but a little before him) as if he feared it would be full ere he came
thither. If he do abstain from any wickedness, yet he abhors it not. It is
for the evil consequents of sin ( viz. shame, loss, punishment) that he
forbeareth it; and not because it is offensivum Dei, and aversivum a Deo, an
offense against God, and a turning away from God; that is no argument at all to
him, sed fertur laxis habenis in quaevis flagitia, but he is hurried headlong
into all wickednesses, as Vulturs fly swiftly to the most stinking carcases.

Verse. 5. Thy mercy O Lord, is in the Heavens.] Yea far above them, Psalm.
Admiratur David incredibilem Dei patientiam, etc. Vat.
108.4. and over all thy good and men's bad works. Otherwise thou could never
endure such provocations of the profane rout; who yet live upon thee, and share
in thy general goodness.

And thy truth unto the cloudes] Gods mercy goes usually yoaked with his truth
and bounded by it; lest any should presume upon it, considering that God is
faithful as well as merciful; faithful, I say, to fulfill both his promises
and his menaces too. And as he has mercy unmeasurable, and truth unfailable
for his Saints; so he has Righteousness and Judgments for the Wicked, as it
follows.

Verse. 6. Thy Righteousness is like the great mountaines] Heb. Mountains of
God, pro more linguae, quae quando magnificat aliquid, addit nomen Dei, ut Jon.
3.3. Genesis Sic (...) Arat. in Diosem. (...)
30.5. Rev. 15.2. Psalm. 80.11. and 68.16. says R. David, that is, after the
manner of the Hebrew tongue, which when it would magnify any thing, adds the
name of God; because as any thing is nearer to God, the more excellent it is.
The like is to be found also in Heathen-Authors. David means that as Gods
mercy is matchless, so his Justice is unmovable; and we are to give him the
glory of the one, as well as of the other, since they are both alike in him; for
whatsoever is in God, is God.

Thy Judgments are a great deep] A fathomlesse abyss, in quam dejicis impios,
and nunquam evadunt, says Kimchi; wherein the Wicked sink irrecoverably. Thy
providentiall dispensations also are past finding out, Romans 11.33. They are to
Reason as the Sea is to Shallows; and therefore we must do by them as the
Romans did by a certain lake of unknown depth, they dedicated it to Victory.

O Lord, thou preservest man and beast] Such is thy beneficence, answerable to
thy patience before celebrated. Thou not only bear with men's evil manners,
even to admiration; but abundantly providest for their being, and well-being;
of such I mean, as walk about the World with hearts as full as Hell of all kind
of wickedness. Howbeit bonitas tua ad Atheum est sicut illa ad bestiam, says
Kimchi, here thou do but for the Atheist, as thou do for the Beast, and by
that course of common preservation and kindness which runs toward all; that
none need doubt of a Providence.

Verse. 7. How excellent (Heb. precious) is thy loving-kindnesse?] That special
love and favor that thou vouchsafest to thine own elect only. Oh this is
incomparable, and inexpressible. It makes a vast difference betwixt the
Righteous and the wicked, though the blind World observes it not.

Therefore the Children of man] Who are also the Children of God, by a better
birth, Joh. 1.12, 13. and that is their greatest preferment, 1 John 3.1.
Ludovicus surnamed the Saint, King of France, would needs be called Ludovicus
de Pissiaco, rather than take greater titles; because there he became a
Christian. He thought no birth to a new birth in Christ, no Parentage to that
of God to his Father.

Put their trust under the shadow of thy wings] As chickens (in a storm, or
when the Purtock threatens) hover and cover under the Hen. See Psalm. 91.
Matthew. 23.

Verse. 8. They shall be abundantly satisfied] Heb. watered, inebriated. They
shall be plentifully provided for, as the Domestics; they shall have a
confluence of all comforts and contentments for this life and a better; for
godliness has the promises of both. Hic locus est consolationis plenissimus,
says One.

And thou shall make them drink of the river of thy pleasure] And so utterly
quench their thirst after the World and sin.

Clitorio quicunque sitim de font levarit,
Vina fugit.
Verse. 9. For with thee is the fountain of life] Vena vita, verae vitae
scaturigo. A fountain communicates its water, and yet is not exhausted.
Fontium perennitas, is one of the wonders in nature; what shall we say of this
divine fountain of life, temporal, spiritual, and eternal, overflowing and
ever-flowing?

In thy light shall we see light] viz. Of knowledge, and comfort; what is the
air without light? or any thing else without God? Absque Deo omnis copia est
egestas, says Bernard. In the former comparison, with thee is the fountain (or
vein) of lives, the Prophet alludeth either to waters, as is aforesaid, or to
metalls; to show that as the veins of gold, silver, and the like, do lie in
bank in the bosom and bowels of the earth; so does life in God. Or, to the
veins of the body, which as so many rivers or rivolets derive their blood from
that red Sea, the liver. Certain it is, that man has neither life nor light in
himself, till it be communicated unto him from God.

Verse. 10. O continue thy loving kindnesse] Heb. Draw it out at full length,
extend and exercise it, lengthen and perpetuate it. Thus the godly greatly
taken with the sweetness of Gods house, and rapt in the admiration of his
transcendent goodness toward them, pray for a continuance thereof; Intimating
also by the manner of expression, that Gods peculiar mercies to his are a
continued series, there is a connection between them, yea a concatenation. And
as in a chain, one link draws on another, so does one mercy another; unless
we break the chain by our unthankfullnesse.

Unto them that know thee -- to the upright in heart] Here we have a just
description of the heirs of Gods promises, and of the partakers of his peculiar
mercies. First, They must be knowing persons; know they must God and his will,
themselves and their duties. Secondly, They must be upright in heart; for
knowledge without practice is like Rachel, beautiful, but barren; or like rain
in the middle region, where it does no good. A good understanding have all they
that do his Precepts, Psalm. 111.10. and such only are upright in heart.

Verse. 11. Terent.
Let not the foot of pride come against mee] The Wicked do manibus pedibusque
obnixe omnia facere, that they may ruin the Righteous; but God can divert
them, manacle them, shackle them that they shall neither march against his
people, nor meddle to unsettle their faith. Nevertheless he looks to be
sought unto for these things, Ezekiel. 36.37. Dan. 10.12. I came forth for thy
word, says the Angel, that is, upon thy prayer.

Verse. 12. There are the workers of iniquity fallen] There where they plotted
or practiced the downfall of the Righteous; as Henry the third of France was
stabbed in the same Chamber where he and others had contrived the Parisian
Massacre. God takes notice of the very place where sin is committed, to punish
accordingly; as he did Abimelech, Ahab, the Jews, that cried Crucify him,
crucify him, etc.

They are cast down] With a force, the Angel of God ^^asing them according to
my prayer, which now methinks I see to be graciously answered. It must needs go
ill with the Wicked, when the Saints shall turn them over to God to be tamed,
and taken an order with.

And shall not be able to rise] Because laid for dead by an Almighty hand. The
Righteous falls seven times in a day, and rises again; not so the workers of
iniquity.

PSALM. XXXVII.
Verse. 1. Fret not thy self because of evil doers] Who prosper in the World,
when better men suffer many times. This made good David sick of the Fret, as
himself testifies, Psalm. 73. till better informed and settled, by repairing to
the Sanctuary, Verse. 17. he wrote this thirty seventh Psalm for the good of
Gods people; lest they being scandalized in like manner, and stumbling at the
same stone that he had done, should want direction, and so fall into
inconvenience, temptation and a snare. David was old when he wrote this Psalm
(as appears Verse. 25. I have been young, and now am old) therefore should his
counsel here given be the more acceptable. He might as well say to men's
tumultuating passions, as once Augustus did to his mutinous soldiers, and
thereby quieted them, Audite senem juvenes, quem juvenem senes aud^erunt. Fret
not your selves, Fret not your selves, I say, to do evil. Be not angry at God,
as Jonah was; or aggrieved, as Jeremy, chap. 12.1. and Habbakkuk, chap. 1.13.
as if the divine providence did not justly divide to every man his due demense,
and do him right; But have patience a while, yea let patience have line and
rope, her perfect work, as St. James has it; and quiet your boiling spirits
with that word, wherewith Christ becalmed the raging sea, Peace, be still. God
will unriddle his providence erelong; and then men shall see the reason of all
occurrences, and that all was done in singular wisdom. Pompoy beaten out of
the field by Caesar, complained that there was a mist over the eye of
providence; when as indeed all the fault was in the soreness or dimnesse of
his own eyes, and the twinkling light of Natures rush-candle. Seneca saw as
far, and said as much to this matter as a Heathen could, in his Tract, Cur
malis been sit, etc. But it is the Sanctuary alone that can afford sound
satisfaction to a soul thus puzzled; as for Philosophical comforts and
counsels in this case, Cicero said well of them, N^s^io quommodo imbe^illior
est medicina quam morbus, However it comes to pass, the disease is too hard
for the medicine.

Neither be thou envious against, etc.] Their prosperity is their portion, all
they are like to have, Psalm. 17.14. and what is it more than a small annuity
for term of life, in the utmost part of that large Lord-ship, whereof thou art
the heir, and shall shortly be the possessour? Queen Elizabeth envyed the
Milkmaid, when she was in prison. But if she had known what a glorious reign
she should have had afterward for forty four years, she would not have envyed
her. And as little needs a godly man, though in misery, to envy a wicked man
in the ruff of all his prosperity and jollity, considering what he has in
hand, much more what he has in hope.

Verse. 2. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass] Faenea quadam
felicitate tempor aliter florent, as Austin phraseth it, but their felicity is
short-lived; this proud grass shall be mowed down ere long, Psalm. 92.7. if not
sooner, yet at death howsoever, which unto them is but a trap-door to Hell.
Envy me not my grapes, said that soldier; I must dye for them. So may wicked
men say of their present prosperity, which is but like Hamans banquet before
execution.

Verse. 3. Trust in the Lord, and do good] These, and the following are
excellent means and medicines against the Fret. True faith will trust in God,
where it cannot trace him; it will also work by love, and by doing good approve
it self to be right; as it appeared by the fruits that it was a good Land; and
as it appeared by the coats, that Dorcas was a good woman.

So shall thou dwell in the Land] Heb. Dwell thou in the Land, viz. be content
with thy lot, not looking at the larger allowances of wicked rich men; who the
more they have of the sat of the earth, the more they will fry and bla^^ in
Hell. Do thou abide in thy station, and serve Gods providence in thy particular
calling.

And verily thou shall be fed] Fed like a Sheep, under the conduct and keeping
of a good Shepherd, as the word signifies. Kimchi reads it, Pasce in
veritate, Feed others with the truth; as the lips of the righteous feed many.
Tremellius renders it, Pascere fide, feed on faith; that is, nourish thy self,
and live by it, according to that of Habbakkuk, chap. 2.4. The just shall live
by his faith. Some render it, Pasce fidem, feed Faith, sc. by pondering the
Promises of God, which are, Pabulum fidei, the food of Faith. Others, Pascere
fideliter, get thy living faithfully, and honestly by thy true labor.

Verse. 4. Delight thy self also in the Lord] Whilst others delight in riches
and pleasures; as if there were no other happiness but to have, and to hold, no
sport unless men may have the Devil their Play-fellow. The like counsel
hereunto gives Saint Paul to his Son Timothy, 1 Epist. 6.12. whilst others lay
hold as with tooth and nayl on riches, etc. lay thou hold on eternal life; make
God thy portion and thou art made for ever.

And he shall give thee the desires of thy heart] It shall be unto thee even as
thou will. It is said of Luther, that he could have what he would of Almighty
God. What may not a Favorite, who has the royalty of his Princes ear, obtain
of him? It is said of S^ianus, that in all his designs he found in Tiberius the
Emperor so great facility and affection to his desires, that he needed only to
ask and give thanks.

Verse. 5. Commit thy way unto the Lord] Heb. Roll thy way, etc. That is, depend
wholly upon him for direction and success in all thine undertakings and
affairs; easing thy mind to him by prayer, Volve, i. e. omnem necessitatem in
cum exoneres. Kimchi.
and casting thy self by faith upon his care and conduct; Cast thy burden upon
the Lord, says David elsewhere.

Trust also in him] Things are therefore repeated in this Psalm, that they may
take the better impression, and beget encouragement.

And he shall bring it to pass] It, that is, whatsoever thou committest to him.

Verse. 6. And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light] God will so
oil thy good name that infamy shall not stick to it. Dirt will stick upon a
Mud-wall, not so upon Marble. But say thou be aspersed, and denigrated by
calumnies, and contumelies cast upon thee, and thou lie under them for a time,
as the earth does under the darkness of the night; yet as the morning suddenly
arising drives away that darkness, so shall God clear up thy wronged
innocence; and as the Moon wadeth out of a Cloud, so shall thou get over all
thy troubles in this kind, or any other; it shall be with thee as it was once
with Cato (whom Seneca calls, the lively picture of Virtues) who was thirty
two times accused in open Court, and as many times cleared and absolved.

And thy judgments as the noon-day] At the Day of Judgment howsoever, if not
sooner; then there will be a Resurrection as well of names as bodies.

Verse. 7. Rest in the Lord] Heb. Be silent to the Lord; Digito compesce
labellum, lay thine hand upon thy mouth when chafing ripe, when ready to let
fly at those that wrong thee. The more silent the Patient is, the more shrill
the Wrong will be, as Numb. 12.2. while Moses is dumb, God speaks; deaf, God
hears and stirs; the less he said and did, the more God struck in for him; and
the less any man striveth for himself, the more is God his Champion; so he do
it to the Lord, that is, in obedience to him, and not for a name, as some
Heathens did.

And wait patiently for him] Or, put thy self to pain for him; that is, though
it go against the hair with thee, and thou find it hard to suffer evil, and to
wait patiently for better, yet do it for his sake, and therein thou shall do
thy self no disservice at all.

Who brings wicked devices to pass] And pleases himself in them, because for
present he prospers; as Dionysius did in his Sacrilege, because no harm to
him followed upon it. Saeculi laetitia, est impunita nequitia, says Austin.

Verse. 8. Cease from anger and forsake wrath] Repetitio est, ut mag is
inculcet, says Vatablus; This precept is doubled and redoubled, that we may
the better retain and practice it. Angry a man may be, and must be at
evildoers, in as much as they break Gods Law, Psalm. 119.135. pollute his Name,
Ezekiel. 36.20.23. Romans 2.23, 24. procure the Judgments of God upon others also,
Josh. 22.18. pull down swift destruction upon themselves, 2 Pet. 2.1. Romans
2.5. Thus Moses was angry, Exodus 32.19. and our Savior, Mark 3.5. yet not so
angry but that they could at some time pity those they were displeased with,
and pray for them too. This they that cannot do, are inordinately and sinfully
angry, and must at any rate suppress such passionate distempers.

Fret not thy self in any mise to do evil] And he shall have much a do not to
overdo, not to do amiss, that bridleth not his passions, for these, like heavy
bodies down steep hills, once in motion, move themselves, and seldom know any
ground but the bottom. Ne igitur accendaris ira saltem ad malefaciendum. Kimchi
renders it, Ne misce as teipsum, Come not in company with the ungodly, at
least to do evil; to do as they do. So to those words in the first verse, Eret
net thy self because of evildoers, the Chaldee adds, to be like unto them.

Verse. 9. For evildoers shall be cut off] Yea, they shall soon be cut off,
verse. 10. and so shall all such, as having a while fretted at them, do at
length revolt to them; as David was ready to do, once at least, Psalm. 73.12,
13, 14. and as some others did out and out, as they say, verse. 10. therefore
his people return hither to their temporal undoing at least.

But those that wait upon the Lord] For deliverance in due season, and for
accomplishment of the Promises. All good people are such Expectants, and should
they dye in a waiting condition (for comfort, I mean) yet are they blessed,
because God has said, Blessed are all they that wait for him, Isa. 3.18.

They shall inherit the earth] Having a right to all, as Heirs of the World
together with faithful Abraham, Romans 4. and although it be detained from them
for a while, as the promised Land was from the Israelites, by the Amorites,
till their sins were full, Genesis 15.16. yet the Saints shall one day have power
over all things; and mean while they are sure of a sufficiency, if not a
superfluity. An Heir during his Minority is many times held to straight
allowance, and forced to borrow of Servants: so it is with the Saints.

Verse. 10. For yet a little while and the micked, etc.] Tantillum, tantillum,
adhuc pauxillum; wait therefore, and fret not. See verse. 9. the same in effect
with this and the next; for more certainty of the matter, and to correct our
short-spiritedness, who would have things done strait upon it, or not at all.

Yea thou shall diligently consider his place] There is neither root nor branch
to be found, tale nor tidings to be heard of him, he is utterly vanished, and
banished out of the world.

Verse. 11. But the meek shall inherit the earth] Our Savior (and probably from
hence) says the same, Matthew. 5.5. See the Notes there, and above, on verse. 9.
of this Psalm.

And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace] because cured of the
Fret, and well content with their present portion; hence that (...), rectitude
of mind, the mother of all true mirth; when the wicked are in a perpetual
inquietude, (...), they are never at rest.

Verse. 12. The wicked plotteth against the just] Plotteth and practices, being
set on by that old Manslayer, who lends the wicked man his seven Heads to
plot, and his ten Horns to push.

And gnasheth upon him with his teeth] Saying unto him, when he has laid hold
on him, Nunc inveni te, as Kimchi Paraphraseth. Now I have found you, and shall
be even with you. Art thou come, thou Villain, said Stephen Gardener to Doctor
Taylour, Martyr, when he first appeared before him? Act. and Mo^
How dare thou look me in the face for shame? Know thou not who I am? Thus
that proud Prelate, gnashing his teeth, and boasting great matters with his
tongue, and he was bravely answered, as has been before related.

Verse. 13, The Lord will laugh at him] See Psalm. 2.4. the righteous also shall
have a time to laugh at him. Psalm. 52.6. and mean while comfort himself with
this, that God laugheth at him, and that therefore himself has no great cause
to cry, since riden do irritos reddit, by laughing at them, he blasteth all
their designs, and that with disgrace: men love not to be laughed at.

For he sees that his day is coming] His dismal day, his Deaths day (which will
also be his Doomsday) that day wherein God has determined to slay them with
their own sword, and to save the Righteous; as it is in the two next verses.
But especially that last and great day of the World, wherein Dicetur reprobis
Ite, Venite probis.

Verse. 14. The Wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their how] That
they may assault the Righteous, both cominus, nearer hand, and eminus, at a
distance; for which purpose they come against him (like a walking Armorie) with
sword, how, and other instruments of death; as resolved to kill and slay. We
are counted as sheep to the slaughter, Romans 8.

Verse. 15. Their sword shall enter into their own heart] As did Saul's, and his
armour-bearers, 1 Samuel 31. See Psalm. 7.16.

Per quod quis peccat, per idem punitur and ipse. And their bows shall be
broken] Neither their bows only, but their arms also, Verse. 17. They shall
utterly be disarmed and disabled, when once God takes them to do; which is
commonly when they are at the strongest, and most confident.

Verse. 16. A little that the Righteous man has, etc.] Whereas it was said
before, The meek shall inherit the earth, some man might object that such are
commonly poor enough; and that is no small affliction, as the Heathens
(Menander, Euripides, Alcaeus, etc.) have affirmed; and experience assures it.
Hereunto is answered, that a little that the Righteous man has is better, etc.
as a box of pearls is more worth than many loads of pibbles. And as a bird
with a little eye, and the advantage of a wing to soar with, may see far
wider than an Ox with a greater; so the Righteous with a little estate, joined
with faith, tranquillity and devotion, may have more pleasure, feel more
comfort, see more of Gods bounty, than one of vast possessions, whose heart
cannot lift it self above the earth, as One well observes. Some render it
thus, Better is the little of one Righteous man, than the plentious Mammon of
many Wicked. The Be is as well (if not better) content with feeding on the
dew, or sucking from a flower, as Behemoth that grazeth on the Mountains. Here
the Psalmist speaks, says Vatablus, of the secret blessing of God; Quia etsi
in diem victitent, e caelotamen non secus ac Manna pascuntur; for although they
have but from hand to mouth, yet they are fed from Heaven, as it were with
Manna.

Verse. 17. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken] i.e. His power, valor,
all that wherein they think their strength and help stands. See verse. 15. the
strongest sinew in the arm of flesh cracks.

But the Lord upholdeth the Righteous*] Though seemingly never so weak and
wealthlesse.

Verse. 18. The Lord knows the days of the upright] In b^num novit, Psalm.
1.6. id est prolongat, says Kimchi; he knows, that is, he acknowledges,
approves, has a gracious regard unto their days, and the events thereof; he
has decreed to a minute how long they shall suffer; and what happiness shall
succeed their sufferings.

And their inheritance shall be for ever] Here, long; and hereafter, eternal.
What they want here, shall be there made up abundantly.

Verse. 19. They shall not be ashamed, etc.] They shall hold up their heads,
when others droop; neither shall they be without comfort in times of common
calamity, as Noah was -- media tranquillus in unda.

And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied] God will work wonders
rather than they shall want any thing that is good for them; as he fed the
Israelites in the Wilderness, Eliah by the Ravens, Jeremy by a special
providence in the siege. As Rochel was relieved by an extraordinary shoal of
fish cast in upon them by divine providence. And as Leiden besiedged by the
Duke of Alva, and forced for their sustenance to search and scrape dunghills,
to boil old leather, etc. was rescued by the turning of the Winds, and swelling
of the Tide, which forced the Duke to raise the siege and be gone.

Verse. 20. But the Wicked shall perish] In the midst of their wealth, and
greatest abundance; their money shall perish with them.

And the enemies of the Lord] These are worse than those Wicked aforementioned,
says Theodoret; they are such as go on still in their trespasses, Psalm. 68.21.

Shall be as the fat of Lambes] which in sacrifices was wholly to be burnt and
consumed, Levit. 3.15, 16, 17.

Into smoke shall they consume away] Smoke, the higher it ascends, the sooner
it vanishes. Quanto fuerit globus ille grandior, tanto vanior, says Austin.
They shall be consumed in the smoke of Gehenna, or Hell, says the Chaldee here.

Verse. 21. The Wicked borrows, and pays not again] Either because he
cannot, he is so unable; or because he cares not, he is so unconscionable. But
in the midst of his wealth, he is many times wanting; in the fulness of his
sufficiency, Non sunt (...) dendo.
he is in straits; and to supply his necessities, sticks long in the Usurers
furnace, which leaves him at last neither metal, nor matter.

But the Righteous shows mercy and giveth] Of that which is his own; to which
end he has a great care to pay his debts. When Archb. Cranmer discerned the
storm which after fell upon him in Queen Mary's days, he took express order
for the payment of all his debts, which when it was done, a most joyful man
was he. How hospitable he was and liberal, Tremelius testifies in his
Epistle before his comment on Hosea.

Verse. 22. For such as be blessed of him, etc.] See Verse. 9. and 11.

Shall be cut off] In hoc seculo and futuro, says Kimchi. Or this verse may be
taken as a reason of the former, viz. why are Wicked rich men so necessitated,
and Righteous men so enabled, enlarged? God curses the one, but blesses the
other, and that is it which makes the odds betwixt them.

Verse. 23. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord] Heb. The steps of a
man; for good men only are reckoned of by God, Jer. 5.1. so a wife is put for a
good wife, Prove. 18.22. A bad wife is but (according to Lamechs second wives
name) Zillah, that is, the shadow of a wife. Now as God chose out the
Israelites way for them all along the wilderness; so he does still for those
that are good, not always the shortest way, but the safest; nor always the
streightest way, but that which most conduces to their journeys end. As
therefote Israel in the Wilderness, so must we follow God, though he seem to
lead us in and out, backward and forward, as if we were treading a maze.

And he delights in his way] His way it is called, for encouragement sake,
though it be God alone who chooses and chalketh out his way, yea causes him to
keep his Commandments, Ezekiel. 36. Certum est nos facere quod facimus; sed Ille
facit ut faciamus. God does all our works for us.

Verse. 24. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down] See Prove.
24.16. If he fall, yet he falls forward; and if he be cast down, yet he
continues not, Quum ruit (...) corruit. Vat.
So 2 Cor. 4.9. as do the wicked, Ezekiel. 32.4. whom God casts into the briars,
and there leaves them.

For the Lord upholdeth him with his hand] Gods hand is still under his; and
his goodness lower than they can fall. His supporting grace preserves them
from utter recidivation; His Almighty power from utter destruction.

Verse. 25. I have been young, etc.] Here he records an experiment of his
(such as whereof, Psalm. 119. is mostly made up) and if other men's experiences
agree not altogether with his, it is no wonder; Kings use not to mind beggars.
Or he might only mean Vagrants; according to that; Let their children be
Vagabonds, and beg their bread. Good men may be compelled to crave their bread,
as David himself did of Ahimelech the High Priest; as Eliah did of the widow
of Sarepta; as those pauperes de Lugduno, and many others have lived upon
alms. But seldom or never have good people needed to crave relief of the
ungodly.

Yet have I not seen the Righteous for saken] Left he may be for a time (as the
Lion leaves his whelps till they are almost famished, and have wel-nigh killed
themselves with roaring, to make them more hardy and valiant) but never
forsaken, no though he beg his bread; because God has said, I will never leave
thee, nor forsake thee. The Righteous is never forsaken, nor his seed too, said
Mr. Perkins. God may cast godly Parents into want, but their godly Children
shall surely be blessed. Others understand by Righteous here, merciful men,
who give alms for the love of God, and therefore come not to poverty, Psalm.
112.5.9. Prove. 11.24, 25. Psalm. 41.1. See Mr. Bradfords sweet letter to Mr.
John Hall and his Wife, Prisoners for the Gospel. Act. and Mon. 1495.

Verse. 26. He is over merciful, and lendeth] Heb. Every day, according to
others necessity, and his own ability; for to stretch beyond the staple, were
to mar all. But he is ever ready to distribute, willing to communicate, 1 Timothy 6.17. as Mr. Wiseheart, the Scotch Martyr, Act. and Mon. 1155. Ib. 1344.
whose charity had never anend, night, day, nor noon, says Mr. Fox; and Thomas
Tomkins, an English Martyr, very forward to lend, looking for nothing again.

And his seed is blessed] Heb. Is in the blessing, that is, receives grace,
and communication of all true goodness from God; and praises, good will, and
good wishes from men. Diod.


Verse. 27. Depart from evil, and do good] See Psalm. 34.14.

And dwell for evermore] Sine indigentia, says Kimchi, without such indigency
and poverty as may drive thee abroad, and make thee beg thy bread. Universal
Righteousness secureth a man from such straights.

Verse. 28. For the Lord loves Judgement] See Psalm. 11.7.

But the seed of the Wicked shall be cut off] See Job 18.19. with the Note.

Verse. 29. The Righteous shall inherit, etc.] This verse has been expounded
before, and is here repeated for more assurance, Verbatoties inculcata viva
sunt, vera sunt, sana sunt, plana sunt.

Verse. 30. The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdome] Having spoken of the
privileges of the Righteous, he now describes them; Tales autem sunt non
quicunque nomen Justorum praetexunt, etc. Such are not all they that pretend to
Righteousness, or can talk of it; but that can speak of it fruitfully,
feelingly, and from an inward Principle: And as he talks, so he walks, ne
dicta fact is erubescant, as Tertullian has it; lest his life should seem to
give the lie to his lips.

Verse. 31. The law of his God is in his heart] He has a Bible in his head, and
another in his heart; he has a good treasure within, and therehence brings
good things; he speaks not by rote, and as a bungler, or as a Philosopher
only; but by proof, and as one that can say, I believed, I have felt it, and
therefore have I spoken.

None of his steps shall slide] How should they, when they walk so exactly, and
by such a rule? Jeremy holding to it, durst say, Lord if I am deceived, thou
have deceived me.

Verse. 32. The wicked watches the righteous] See Psalm. 10.8, 9, 10. with the
Notes. Speculatur, he accurately observes; looking this way and that, as a
watchman in a Watchtower. Thus Sauleyed David, and laid out for him. Thus
Jeroboam watched those of the ten Tribes that went to Jerusalem to worship, he
watched them, and waylaid them, Hos. 5.1.

And seeks to slay him] All malice is bloody, and there want not those still
that carry about Cains bloody club, hating to the death that goodness in
another, that they neglect in themselves.

Verse. 33. The Lord will not leave him in his hands] For he knows how to
deliver his, 2 Pet. 3.9. as that Apostle could say by good experience, Act. 12.
when he was inter saxum and sacrum, as they say.

Nor condemn him, when he is judged] Heb. condem him for wicked; but clear and
acquit him, when falsely accused, yea when wrongfully condemned.

Verse. 34. Wait on the Lord] Bind him not to a day, wake not the Beloved, til
he please.

Keep his way] For out of Gods precincts, out of his protection,

When the Wicked are cut off, thou shall see it] See and smile, look and laugh,
Psalm. 52.6, 7. See the Note there.

Verse. 35. I have seem the wicked in great power] Or, Formidable to others;
first, a terror, and shortly after, a scorn.

And spreading himself like a green Bay tree] Or, Cedars of Lebanon, as the
Greek has it, i.e. priding himself in his great prosperity,

Verse. 36. Yet be passed away, etc.] The Greek and Latin have it, I passed by.
See verse. 10. how soon and utterly withered and wasted the Fig Tree, Christ
cursed? so forcible is his curse.

Verse. 37. Mark the perfect m^n, etc.] As we must treasure up experiences our
selves: so we must stir up others to do the like. There is a woe ^o such as
consider not the operation of Gods hands, Isa. 5.12.

For the end of that man is peace] Though his beginning and middle may be
troublesome, yet his end (his after-and at least) shall be peace. He shall by
death enter into peace, rest in his bed, Isa. 57.2.

Verse. 38. But the transgressors, etc. Here the end is worse than the
beginning. Sin ever ends tragically.

The end of the wicked shall be cut off] Their end is not death but
destruction; they are killed with death, Rev. 2.23. life and hope end together.

Verse. 39. But the salvation of the righteous, etc.] (...) ut pa^o^i^ (...)
co^^lectar, their salvation temporal and eternal is of the Lord: so is also the
destruction of the wicked, as is here necessarily implied.

He is their strength, etc.] That they faint not; sink not under the heaviest
burden of their light afflictions, which are but for a moment.

Verse. 40. And the Lord shall help them, etc.] He shall, He shall, He shall. Oh
the Rhetoric of God! the safety of the Saints! the certainty of the Promises!

PSALM. XXXVIII.
A Psalm of David to bring to remembrance] Made purposely for a memorial, both
of what he had suffered, and from what he had been delivered. See 1 Chronicles.
16.4. Exodus 30.16. Lev. 2.2. and 6.15. Recordat^^^ autem intelligitur misery
ex misericordia, Psalm. 132. Isa. 62.6. and 63.7. It is probable that David had
so laid to heart the Rape of his Daughter Tamar, the Murder of his eldest Son
Amnon, the flight of his next Son Absalom, and other troubles that befell him;
( Basil thinks Absoloms conspiracy, Ahitophels perfidy, Shimeies insolency,
etc.) that it cost him a great fit of sickness; out of which hardly recovering,
he penned this and some other Psalms (as the 35.39, 40.) but this especially
for a Momento, to imminde him of his own late misery, and Gods never-failing
mercy to him. Both these we are wondrous apt to forget, and so both to lose the
fruit of our afflictions, by falling afresh to our evil practices (as Children
soon forget a whipping.) and to rob God our Deliverer of his due praises: like
as with Children, eaten bread is soon forgotten. Both these mischiefs, to
prevent, both in himself and others (for we are bound not only to observe Gods
Law, but also to preserve it as much as may be from being broken) David
composed this Psalm, for to record, or to cause remembrance (See the like
title, Psalm. 70.) and for a form for a sick man to pray by, as Kimchi notes;
not to be sung for those in Purgatory, as some Papists have dreamed.

Verse. 1. O Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath] He begins and ends the Psalm
with Petitions, fills it up with sad complaints; wherein we shall find him
groaning, but not grumbling; mourning, but not murmuring; for that is not the
guise of Gods people. He begins with Eheu Jehova non recuso coargui and
castigari; Correct me O Lord, but with Judgment, not in anger, lest thou bring
me to nothing, Jer. 10.24. See Psalm. 6.1. with the Notes.

Verse. 2. For thine arrows stick fast in me] i. e. Sicknesses of body, R.
Obadiah. Deus amatquod sagittat. Aug.
and troubles of mind, Job 6.4. Psalm. 18.14. the Jew-Doctors say, that he had
a Leprosy for fix Months; and that the Divine presence was taken away from
him; so that he complained not without cause. But these were sagitta salut is,
says Chrysostom, Arrows of Salvation, Love Tokens from the Lord, not unlike
Jonathans arrows, 1 Samuel 20.36. and he had been forewarned of them by Nathan
the Prophet; 1 Samuel 12 and so bore them the better. Praevisa jacula minus
forinnt, Darts foreseen are in a manner dintless.

And thine band presses me sore] Heb. Thou let down thy hand up^s me. Now
Gods hand is a mighty band, 1 Pet. 5.6. and the weight of it is importable, but
that Vna eademque manus, etc.

Verse. 3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of (...)] This was the
immediate cause of David's misery, it came from love displeased; and (...) sins
seldom ^^^pe better. But blessed be our Almighty (...), who (...) health out of
sickness, by bringing thereby the body of death into a Consumption.

Neither is there any rest in my bones] ^is repetit, mere l^gentium. He says
the same thing twice; as Mourners use to do but with an aggravation of his
pain, reaching to his very bones.

Because of my sin] This was the remote cause of his present sufferings; and is
the true Mother of all man's misery. Now when these two (Gods wrath, and man's
sin) meet in the soul, as physic and sickness in the stomach, there must needs
be much unrest, till they be vomited up by confession. It Is as natural for
guilt to br^^d disquiet, as for putrid matter to br^^d vermin. Let God
therefore be justified, and every mouth stopped.

Verse. 4. Sicut aquae praevalentes in quibus erat absorptus* Kimchi
For mine iniquities are gone over my head] So that I am even overwhelmed by
them, and almost drowned in perdition and destruction. The Gospel is post
naeufragium tabula; and assures us that God has cast all our sins into the
bottom of the Sea; and this keeps the head of a sinking soul above water.

As an heavy burden] How light soever sin seems in the committing, it will
lie full heavy, even as a Talent of lead, Zach. 5.7. or as an huge Mountain,
Heb. 12.1. A facie irae tuae. A facie peccati mei. A facie stulritiae meae.
when once we come to a sight and sense of it, when Gods wrath and man's sin
shall face one another, as the former verse has it, according to the original.

Verse. 5. My wounds stink, and are corrupt] What his grief or disease was, we
read not; some say the Leprosy; some take all this allegorically, the word
rendered wounds, Livores vibices turnices.
signifies stripes, scarres, wailes, mattery soars, running ulcers, the
effects of the envenomed arrows of the Almighty. Could we but foresee what sin
will cost us, we durst not but be innocent. That we do not, is extreme
foolishness, as David here acknowledges.

Because of my foolishnesse] In not considering aforehand the heinousness of
my sin^nor the heaviness of the divine displeasure. The word signifies
unadvised rashness, Prove. 14.17. and it is probable he means his great sin
with Bathsheba, wherein he was miscarried by his lusts to his cost. See Psalm.
107.17, 18. Because of my foolishness, i.e. Quia non praveni Nathanons
confessione, says R. Obadiah, because I prevented not Nathans coming, by a
voluntary confession of my sin unto the Lord.

Verse. 6. I am troubled (Heb. wryed) I am bowed down etc.] Incurvus et prorsu^
obstipus, arroque vul^u squallidus, vix corpus traho, I am a pitiful poor
creature, and in a most heavy Condition, as appears by my gate, my gesture,
my looks, and habit. See Psalm. 35.14.

Verse. 7. Faemora me^ prorsus occupat atdens ulcus. Vat. In quit us est
concupiscentia, Theodoret.
For my loins are filled with a loothsome disease] The loins, those seats of
lust, are now grievously inflamed and pained with some impostumated matter, or
pestilentiall carbuncle: Morbo vilissim, quem nominare dedecet, says
Aben-Ezra. God often punishes sin in kind, and speaks to the Conscience in
its own Language, that such a sickness was the fruit of such a sin.

And there is no soundness in my flesh] Principium dulce est, sed finis Amoris
amarus,
Lata venire Venus, tristis abire solet.


Sin is as the poysen of Aspes, which first tickleth him that is stung, and
makes him laugh: till by little and little, it gets to the heart, and then
puts him to intolerable torture.

Verse. 8. I am feeble and sore broken] Through the length and nature of my
distemper, Isai. 38.10, 12. The same Hebrew word signifies pining sickness,
and a th^^^, because of the thinness and weakness of it.

I have (...)] But not repined: this nature prompteth to, when we are in
extremity; and grace is not against it.

Verse.9. Lord all my desire is before thee] Confused desires, broken requests,
if from a (...) spirit are upon the file of heaven, and stand before God till
they may have an answer.

And my (...) hid from thee] No, not my breathing. Lam. 3.56 God (...) groaning
of his people go to his heart.

Verse. 10. (...)] Heb. (...) tossed and ^ro, circuivit cor moum, inordinate
movetur, et non quiescit, says Aben-Ezra The Hebrew word signifies such a
kind of motion as that of Merchant, who run up and down from one Country to
another. Also the two last Radical are doubled to note, that it is more than an
ordinary stirring and motion of the spirit, because it is not come to its rest.
All earthly things to the soul are but as the air to the stone, can give it no
stay till it come to God the center. As the circle is the perfectest figure,
because it begins and ends the points do meet together. (as Mathematicians
give the reason) the last point meets in the first, from whence it came. So
shall we never come to perfection or satisfaction (says a Reverend man) till
our souls come to God, till God make the circle meet, etc. The Wicked wall^ the
round from one creature to another, Plas. 12.9. but they come not at God and
hence they are so dis-satisfied. Return to thy rest (Heb. Rests) says David to
his soul, that is to God, to whom he here makes his moan, Miser anime varias
subinde parts abreptus me deserit.

As for the light of mine eyes] that lumen amicum of mine eyes is almost quite
benighted.

Verse. 11. My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore] Heb. Praehorrore
detrectantes accedere. Trem.
^ry strank, which therefore some Jew-Doctors will have to be the Leprosy,
which was noisome and contagious: and therefore by the Law of God none were to
come near such. So among the Persians, none might come near a Pisaga (so they
called a Leper) and therefore Magabyzus having offended Artaxerxes, Ctes. Pers.
kept himself five years from Court pretending himself a Leper and in that
space made his peace with the King. But in David's friends, who dealt thus with
him, it was not so much fear of danger, as pride and perfidy, that made them
deny him all duty and friendship, Psalm. 31.11. Job was so used, Chap. 6.15.
Sophoc. Val. Mar. Plutarch. in Alex.
and our Savior when he hung naked on the Cross, Luk, 23.49. and St. Paul,
when he made his defense before Nero, 2 Timothy 4.16. So was not Orestes by his
friend Pylades, nor Dam^n by his Pythias, nor Achilles by Patr^clus, which made
Alexander cry out O felicem juvenem! Trouble tries who are friends who
traitors.

Verse. 12. They also that seek after my life] That seek and would suck my
blood. As his friends were slack to help him, so his foes were active to hurt
him. This David relates before the Lord, that he may pity him and be so much
the more engaged to him; for he knew that where humane help fails, (...) ab
(...)
divine begins.

Speak mischievous things] Exitialia, such things as wring from me that
lamentable voice, Woe and Alas, woeful evils. voce (...)


And imagine deceits] Or, Murmr,

Verse. 13. But I as a deaf man heard not] But possessed my soul in patience; in
quietness and confidence was my strength, Isa. 30.15. As they were Masters of
their tongues, so was I of mine ears. He that cannot bear calumnies reproaches
and injuries, cannot live, faith Chytraeus; let him even make up his pack, and
get him out of the World. Vitus Theodorus sends to advise with Melancthon what
to do when Osiander preached against him? Melancthon desired him for Gods sake
to make no reply, but to behave himself as a deaf man that heard not. Vitus
writes back that this was very hard; yet he would obey. Another bravely
answered one that railed upon him, Facile est in me dicore, cum non sim
responsurus, Thou may speak what thou will; but I will hear no more than I
list, and punish thee with silence, or rather with a merry contempt. Princes
use not to chide (...) Ambassadors offer them indecencies, but to deny them
audience. That man certainly enjoys a brave composedness, who sets
himself above the flight of the injurious claw.

And I was as a dumb man, etc.] He answered them by silence and taciturnity
which is the best answer to words of scorn and petulancy; Thus Isaac his
Brother Ismael and our Savior, Pilat, Herod, and Caiaphas; and Giles of
Brassels, when the barking Friars reviled him, held his peace continually;
insomuch that those blasphemers would say abroad, that he had a dumb Devil in
him. Act. and M^n 811.
This is a great victory, not to render evil for evil, or railing for
railing, a Pet. 3.9. Nihil fortius, nihil magis egregiam quam audire (...)
says Cassiodore, nothing is more and return no answer. As on the contrary,
(...) he goes by the worst that has the better, faith Basit. And, Sile, and
funestam dedisti plagam, says (...). Say nothing in such a case, and thou
thereby give thine adversary a deadly blow.

Verse. 14. Thus was I (...) a man (...)] He doubleth his speech, to show his
holy pertinacy in a prudent and patient silence, though greatly provoked. David
was, as it is reported of (...) the Emperor, (...), careful of what was to be
done by him, but careless of what was said of him by others. As Augustus, he
did but laugh at the Satyrs and Buffoner^^^ published against him. He knew that
as Physical pills must not be chewed, but swallowed whole; so must many
injuries and indignities. Conviti^ spreta ex^les^^nt.

Verse. 15. For in thee, O Lord, do I hope] This was the ground of his patience,
and differenceth it from that of Heathens, which was rather perti^acy than
patience, and came not from a right principle.

Thou wile hear] Or answer; and therefore what need is there of my answer.

Verse. 16. For I said, hear me, lest otherwise, etc.] He spread their vile
speeches before the Lord, as afterward good (...) did Rabsheeds Letter; and as
it was said of Charles 5. that he spoke more to God than to men; so did David.
His former silence therefore was not either from stupidity (a Sheep bitten by a
Dog is as sensible thereof as a Swine, though he make not so great a noise) nor
from inability to make his own defense, if it had been to any purpose, for he
was both innocent and eloquent: but he thought it far better to sustain
himself in faith and patience, and meekly to commit himself to God in
well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator. Besides, he feared, lest if he spoke
at all in this case, he should speak unadvisedly with his lips (as it is very
east to exceed) and so give occasion to the enemy to triumph, as the Papists
did over Luther, for his hot and hasty speeches.

When my foot slippeth] Or, when my tongue out-lasheth in the least, they
desire no other sport, but lay it in my dish as a foul disgrace. My Motto
therefore shall be, (and my practice according) Taceo, Fero, Spero, I say
nothing, but suffer, and hope for better.

Verse. 17. For I am ready to halt] i.e. to mis-behave my self, and so to mar
a good cause by ill managing it, and then what will become of thy great Name?
This is a very forcible inotive to prevail with a jealous and just God.

And my sorrow is continually before me] That is, my sin, as Eccles. 11.10. Or,
my sorrow, but much more my sin the cause of it.

Verse. 18. For I will declare mine iniquity] To them that visit me in this
disease, says Aben-Ezra, that they may pray for me, according to Jam. 5.16. or
rather to God, that he may pardon me, and ease me. Or thus, When I declare,
etc. Then

Verse. 19. Mine exemies are lively, etc.] q. d. It is nuts to them, and they
soon compose Comedies out of my Tragedies, growing more insolent by mine
afflictions, and upbraiding me with my sins.

Verse. 20. They also that render evil for good] Whilst they rejoice at my
misery, who fasted for them in their adversity, Psalm. 35.15.

Are mine adversaries] Heb. They Satanically hate me, as if they were
transformed into somany breathing Devils.

Because I follow the thing that good is] This was Devil-like indeed: this was
to hate and perlecute God in David. Tertul.
Thus Cain the Devils Patriarch hated his brother Abel, and slew him: And why?
Because his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous, 1 John 3.12. For
like cause Meab fretted at Israel, Numb. 22.324 and the Courtiers at Daniel,
chap. 6.5.

Verse. 21. Forsake me not, O God] This was that he most of all feared,
Spiritual desertion. So Jeremy, Be not (...), O God; and then I care not what
else can befall me.

O my God, (...) than far from me] Though my friends stand aloof, verse. 11.
yet ^e thou ever a^ hand ^o help me.

(...) his blessings to us.

PSALM. XXXIX.
Verse. 1. I said, I will take heed] He resolved so Psalm. 38.13, 14. sc. Ejusdem
(...) est hic (...) cum (...) Cimch^
no continue as one deaf and dumb, to use Is^^cks Apology to scoffing Ismael,
viz. no Apology, unless it be that which is Real; for Vivendo melius
arguuntur obtrectatores, quam loquendo, slanderers and railers are best
answered by silence.

That I sin not with my tongue] An hard task, a long lesson, as Pambus in the
Ecclesiastical history, found it by experience; and after many years trial,
could not take it out. For the tongue is an unruly Member: And if any man
offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the
whole body, Jam. 3.2. David resolved to temper his tongue, and to keep a bridle
or a muzzle for his mouth, whiles he was in extremity of pain, and in the
presence of the Wicked, who lay at the catch, and would soon exclaim; but his
heart deceived him, for he quickly after brake his word, verse. 3. and made a
rash request, verse. 4. so great need is there that the best pray to God to keep
the door, as Psalm. 141.3.

Verse. 2. I was dumb with silence] As not willing either to open the mouths of
those dead dogs; or to cast pearls before those sensual swine.

I held my peace even from good] That good which I might have spoken in mine
own defense, and their reproof, ne miscerem illiud cum malo, says One,
Intellige (...) bono licito, non de bon^ necessario (...) praecepto.
lest some evil should be mingled with it; as mud and gravel is with the
clear water that runs down a current.

And my sorrow was stirred] Heb. Troubled; Though I had somewhat to do, to do
it. Corruption must be curbed, and kept in by violence, Jam. 1.26.

Hanc fraenis, hanc tu compesce catenis. Verse. 3. My beart was hot within me]
It was almost suff ocated for want of vent. By heat of heart, and fire kindled,
says One, the Prophet means, T. W. in loc.
not only the greatness of his grief, as they that are grievously sick feel
great force and power of heat; but he means also some motions that he had to
impatiency and fretting; to which fault they are very much subject, that are
hot, and given to heat, Thus He. This distemper to prevent, God and Nature have
placed the heart near unto the lungs, ut cum ira accenditur, pulmonis humore
temperetur, that when it is heated with wrath, it may be cooled and qualified
by the allay of the lungs.

While I was musing, the fire burnt] This shows that thoughts and affections
are the mutual causes one of another; so that thoughts kindle affections, and
these cause thoughts to boil. And hence it is, faith a Reverend man, that
new-converts, having new and strong affections, can with more pleasure think of
God, than any.

Then spoke I with my tongue] But better he had held his tongue, according to
his first resolution. The Greeks have a saying, Let a man either keep silence,
or speak that which is better than ^lence. Austin paraphraseth thus; when I
refrained so from speaking, for fear of speaking evil, that I spoke no good, I
was troubled at this my silence; lest my sin should be counted greater for this
silence, than my virtue in refraining from speaking evil.

Verse. 4. Lord, make me to know mine end] This Aust in expounds of Heaven
the end of all his troubles, which he now sighed after. But Vatablus, Calvin,
and most modern Interpreters conceive that David does here ingenuously confess
that he grudged against God; considering the greatness of his grief, and the
shortness of his life.

And the measure of my dayes] An admalorum qua perfero compensationem
sufficiant, whether they are likely to be enough to make me amends for my
grievous sufferings. This he seems to speak either out of impatiency, or
curiosity at least.

That I may know how frail I am] How soon-ceasing, and short lived. Quam
darabilis sum. Trem^
Vatablus has it, quam mandanus sim, how long I am like to be a man of this
World, this vale of misery, and valley of tears.

Verse. 5. Behold, thou have made my days as an handbreadth] i. e. Four fingers
broad, (which is one of the least Geometrical measures, or a span-long) as
some interpret it. Now to spend the span of this transitory life, after the
ways of a man's own heart, is to bereave himself of a room in that City of
Pearl, and to perish for ever. Or take it for an handbreadth; should a man,
having his lands divided into four parts (answerable to those four fingers
breadth) leave three of them untilled? should he not make the best of that
little time that he has? that he be not taken with his task undone?
Themistocles dyed about an hundred and seven years of age; and when he was to
dye, he was grieved upon this ground, Now I am to dye faith he, when I begin to
be wise. But Stultus semper incipit vivere, says Seneca; and such complaints
are bootlesse. O live quickly, live apace and learn of the Devil at least to be
most busy as knowing that our time is short, Rev. 12.12. To complain of the
miseries of life, and to wish for death, as David here seems to do (and as
did Job, chap. 3.19. and 6.9. and 7.15. and Moses, Number. 11.11, 15. Elias, 1
King. 19.4. Jeremy, chap. 20.14. Jonas 4.3.) is a sign of a prevailing
temptation, and of a spirit fainting under it. We must fight against such
impatiency; and learn to do the like by life, as we do by a lease, wherein if
our time be but short, we rip up the grounds, eat up the grass, cut down the
copses, and take all the liberty the lease will afford.

Mine age is as nothing] Heb. My world, that is my time of abode in the World
is but a magnum Nibil, as one says of honor; Punctumest quod vivimus, and
puncto minus, a mere Salve vale, a nonentity.

Verily every man at his best estate] When he is best constituted and
underlaid, set to live, Profecto omnimoda vani tas omnis homo est quantumvis
constitutus maxim. Tremel. Kimchi.
as one would think, firmus and fixus, settled on his best bottom, yet even then
he is all over vanity; All Adam is all Abel, as the original runs elegantly,
alluding to those two proper names, like as Psalm. 144.3, 4. Adam is Abels mate,
or man is like to a soon vanishing vapor; such as is the breath of ones mouth.
See Jam. 4.14. a feeble flash, a curious picture of Nothing.

Verse. 6. Surely every man walk^th in a vain shew] Heb. In an image, or, in a
shadow, as Job 14. 2. in the shadow of death as some sense it; his life is like
a picture drawn upon the water, says Theodoret; it passes away as an hasty,
headlong torrent. Verily, surely, surely, it is so; Selah, you may seal to it.

Surely they are disquieted in vain] Heb. They keep a stir, and trouble the
World, as did great Alexander; who surfeiting of his excessive fortunes, from
the darling of Heaven, Two fits of an ague could shake greit Tamerlan to death.
came to be the disdain of the Earth, which he had so often disquieted. So the
Emperor Adrian, who troubling himself and others to little good purpose, dyed
with this saying in his mouth, Omnia fui, and nibil profuit, I have tried all
conclusions, but go nothing. And says not Solomon as much in his Ecclesia stes?

He heapeth up riches, and knows not who shall gather them] i.e. Enjoy them.
See Eccles. 2.18, 19. and be moderate. Think when you lock up your money in your
chest (says One who shall shortly lock you up in your coffin. Think how that
this very night thy soul may he required of thee; and then whose shall those
things be which thou have provided. Luke 12.20?

Verse. 7. ^eza.
And now Lord, what wait I for?] q. d. Absit ergo ut de is it is quisquiliis sim
anxius, Far be it from me to trouble my self about these transitory trifles;
I am bent to depend on thee alone, to wait for thy favor, and desire it above
all earthly felicity; to place all my hope on thee alone, who being my Lord,
wilt nor, can not cast off thy poor servant, who desires to fear thy Name.

Verse. 8. Deliver me from all my transgressions] But especially from that of
impatiently desiring to dye out of discontent, verse. 4. The sense of this one
sin brought many more to remembrance; as a man by looking over his debt-book
for one thing, meets with more. God gives the penitent general discharges;
neither calls he any to an after-reckoning.

Make m^e not the reproach of the foolish] Let not any Wicked one (for such are
all fools in Gods dictionary) lay this folly in my dish, that I so foolishly
desired death in a pet.

Verse. 9. I was dumb. I opened not my mouth] Or, Better thus, I should have
been dumb, and not have opened my mouth, according to my first resolution. I
should not have reasoned, or rather wrangled with thee, as verse. 4. but have
kissed thy rod in an humble submission, and have known that the rod of Aaron,
and pot of Manna must go together. Macrobius writes that the image of
Angeronia among the old Romans was placed on the Altar of Volupia, with the
mouth closed and sealed up; to signify, that such as patiently and silently
bear their griefs, do thereby attain to greatest pleasures.

Because thou did it] This is indeed a quieting consideration, and will
notably quell and kill unruly passions. Set but God before them, when they are
tumultuating, and all will be soon hushed. This made Jacob so patient in the
rape of his Daughter Dinah; Job, in the loss of his goods by the Sabaan
spoylers; David, in the barkings of that dead dog Shim^i; that noble Lord of
Plessis, in the loss of his only son, a Gentleman of mavelous great hopes,
slain in the wars of the Low Countries. His Mother more impatient, dyed of the
grief of it: But his Father laid his hand on his mouth, when Gods hand was on
his back; and used these very words, I was dumb, and opened not my mouth,
because thou did it.

Verse. 10. Removethy stroke away from mee] Having first prayed off his sin, he
would now pray off his pain; though it less troubled him; and for ease, he
repaireth, to Jehovah that heals, as well as wounds, Hos. 6.1.

nam qui tibi vulnera fecit.
Solus Achilleo tellere more potest. Ovid. Trist 1.

I am consumed by the blow of thine hand] Heb. By the conflict or buffettings.
Oh keep out of his fingers; for it is a fearful thing to fall into them, Heb.
10. Caveb is autem sipavebis.

Verse. 11. When thou with rebukes do correct man for iniquity] Or, Should
thou but correct him according to his iniquity; correct him I say, or instruct
him. Kimchi his Note here is, Morbi sunt interpretes inter Deum and homines
increpantes, ut Job 33.19. Diseases are Gods chiding messages, or real rebukes.

Thou make his beauty] Heb. What soever in him is desirable, all his prime
and pride, pulchritudinem and praestantiam, his beauty and bravery, as that of
Jonas his gourd.

To consume away like a moth] Heb. To melt away as a moth, which is easily
crushed betwixt ones fingers, Job 4.19. or actively, as a moth, Quam^is (...)
palam fulmine e (...) Vat.
caeco morsu does secretly and suddenly consume the most precious garment, so
do thou the Wicked by thy secret curse, though themselves or others little
observe it.

Surely every man is vanity, Selah] See verse. 5.

Verse. 13. Hear my prayer O Lord, give ear, etc.] My prayer, my cry, my tears.
See how his ardency in prayer grew by degrees, and so availed much, Jam. 5.16.
we must rise in our requests, pray, cry, weep, ask, seek, knock, let the Lord
see that we are in good earnest; and then we may have any thing. Tears have a
voice, and are very effectual Orators.

For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner] And in that respect subject to
many miseries and molestations satanicall and secular, till I shall repatriasse
get home (as Bernard expresses it) and this was the condition of all my godly
predecessors, who yet found favor with thee, and so I hope shall I.

Verse. 13. O spare me that I may recover strength] Ut refociller, reficiar;
Job makes the like request, chap. 10.20. Some breathing while they would have,
and a time to recollect themselves, before that last great encounter; They say
in effect Differ, habent parvae commoda magna morae.

Before I go hence, and be no more] No more seen amongst men. It is said,
Speed. 925.
that Richard the third caused the dead corpse of his two smothered Nephews to
be closed in lead, and so put in a coffin full of holes and hooked at the ends
with two hooks of Iron; and so to be cast into a place called the black deeps,
at the Thames mouth, whereby they should never rise up, nor be any more seen.
Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, Genesis 42.36. The Righteous perish, Isa. 57.1.
when once I go hence, says David here, viz. to my long home, Eccles. 12.5.
there will be a Non ego, an end of me as to this World; wherefore I beg a
little respite.

(...) PSALM. XL.
Verse. 1. I waited patiently for the Lord] Heb. In waiting I waited; Diutissime
quidem, sed optimo successu; Est sensus ejusdem cum duobus prioribu^^ Kabuenat.
I prayed and waited, I waited and prayed again; persevering in prayer, and
begging audience, as Psalm. 39.12, with which Basil makes this Psalm to cohere,
and well he may, for it seems to be of the same time and argument with the
two former. R. Obadiah says, that David composed this Psalm after that he was
recovered of his Leprosy, Psalm. 38.7.

And he inclined unto me] i.e. he began at length to show favor; for he
waits to be gracious, and well knows that desideria dilatione crescant, and
cito data vilescant: nothing is lost, by holding his people long in request.

Verse. 2. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit] e puteo sonitus, ut
Isa. 17.12^ out of a noyse-full pit, where there is a continual hurry by the
great fall of waters into it; He means, out of dreadful dangers, out of a
desperate disease, says R. Obadiah; who also by rock here understands
perfect health, Sanitatem in corpore, sanctitatem in cord.

Out of the miry clay] E luto, Luto, says Kimchi, for here are two words used,
of one and the same sense; to show, that as a bemired beast he was in a
perishing condition, till God pulled him out, and set him on firm ground.

And established my goings] That I might not relapse into the same, or fall
into another malady or mischief.

Verse. 3. And he has put a new song in my mouth] i. e. new matter, which I
shall soon contrive into a new song, by the help of his holy Spirit: for I
cannot breath out a desire after him, except he first imbreath me therewith,
and so put a new song in my mouth.

Even praise unto our God] i.e. Unto Christ, says Junius, to whom, and of whom
the Church sings, says he, in the following verses.

Many shall see it, and fear, and trust in the Lord] Their eye shall affect
their heart, both with fear of, and faith in the Lord, that brings greatest
things to pass, and is fearful in praises, doing wonders, Exodus 15.

Verse. 4. Blessed is that man, etc.] See Psalm. 2.12.

And respects not the proud.] Who are set in opposition to Believers, as they
are also, Hab. 2.4. Self justitiaries especially, and Merit-mongers: faith is
an humbling grace.

Nor such as turn aside to lies] As do Heretics and Idolaters. These, the true
believer, out of the greatness of his spirit, slighteth, how great soever they
be: Animo magno nihil magnum.

Verse. 5. Many O Lord my God are thy Works which thou have done] Many and great
and all for them that trust in thee: Who therefore must needs be blessed, as
verse. 4.

And thy thoughts which are to us-ward] Thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to
give us an expected end, Jer. 29.11.

They cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee] No, nor yet out of order; and
yet we must be reckoning and relating them as we are able, to God, and men, by
speaking good of his name; and at this David was old excellent, as we say.

If I would declare and speak of them] By wholesale we must do it, though we
cannot so well by retale; particulars also must be instanced, as Moses does to
Jethro, Exodus 22. and for that end Catalogues must be kept; See one Judge.
10.11.12.

Verse. 6. Sacrifice and offering thou did not desire] Comparatively to the
obedience of faith, 1 Samuel 15.22. without which when Hypocrites thought to
bribe God by cold Ceremonies, they were rejected. Christ is the end of the Law
to all that believe; that Lamb of God slain from the beginning of the world is
the only Expiatory Sacrifice, and the foundation of that fore mentioned
blessedness, ver. 4. Now since Christ suffered, the Levitical Sacrifices being
abolished, we have none to offer but such as are gratulatory: to show our
thankfulness for such a Redeemer, whose perfect obedience, with the fruit of
it, is here, and in the following Verses both described, and set forth for an
absolute pattern to us of performing our duty toward God, for this inexplicable
mercy. Confer. Heb. 10.5, 6. etc. Here we have in Christ for our instruction,
and in David also (his Type) for our example; 1. A firm purpose of obedience,
in a bored ear, and a yielding heart. 2. A ready performance thereof, Lo I
come. 3. A careful observance of the Word written. In the volume of thy Book it
is written of me, verse 7. 4. D. (...)
An hearty delight in that observance, verse. 8.5. A public profession and
communication of Gods goodness to others, verse. 9, 10. Now^ we should labor to
express Christ to the world, to walk as he walked, 1 Feb. 2.6. our lives should
be in some sense parallel with his life, as the transcript with the original:
He left us a Copy to write by, says Saint Peter, 1 Epist. 2.21.

Mine ears have them opened] Heb. dug, bored; an hearing ea^ have thou
bestowed upon me, which is a fingular favor; for life enters by the ear, Isa.
55.3. as did death at first, Genesis 3. O pray, that God would make the bore wide
enough. that the inward ears being drawn up to the outward, one sound may
pierce both at once.

Verse. 7. Then said I, Lo I come] Christ became obedient even to the death, yea
that of the Cross, Phil. 2.8. Christ's people also are a willing people, Psalm.
110.3. their obedience is prompt, and present, ready, and speedy, without
delays and consults, Psalm. 119.60. without capitulation and security, Isa. 56.6.

In the volume of thy book] In libre plicatili, in thy Law which was anciently,
(and is till this day amongst the Jews) written in Paper, or Parchment rolled
up; because it will last longer rolled than folded.

It is written of me] Of Christ, in many places: for He is both Author, Object,
Matter, and Mark of both Testaments. Of David also, and all Gods people, does
the Law speak with fruit and efficacy; and they do use to read their own names,
written as it were in every precept, promise, threatening. Look how men read the
Statute-book of the Land, as holding themselves highly concerned therein; So
here.

Verse. 8. I delight to do thy will, O my God] To Christ it was his meat and
drink, Fob. 4. he set his face to do it, and to suffer it, Luke 9.51, yea he
was straightned, pained till it was done, Luk, 12.50. And the same mind is
also in the Saints that was in Christ Jesus, Phil. 2.5. They delight in the Law
of God after the inward man, Romans 7.22, they prefer it before their necessary
food, Job 23.12.

Tea thy Law is within my heart] Heb, In the midst of my bowels; there is the
counterpane, the duplicate of the Law written, yea printed, Jer. 31.33. 2 Cor.
3.3. Rip up my heart (said Queen Mary) when I am dead, and there shall you
find Gallice, the loss whereof (it is thought) killed her. Rip up the most men's
hearts, and there you shall find written, The god of this present world. But
Gods Law is in good men's hearts, to live and to dye with it. O beata
Apocalypsis (said that Martyr, catching up the Revelation ca^t into the same
fire with him to be burnt) O blessed Revelation, how happy ans I to be burned
with thee in my hands!

Verse. 9. I have preached righteousness in the great congregation] David did
this, but Christ much more by the everlasting Gospel, sent the whole world
throughout: great was the company of Preachers, and large was their commission.
See a draught of it, Acts 26.18.

I have declared thy faithfulness, and thy salvation] Righteousness of Christ
imputed, faithfulness of God in fulfilling his Promises, Salvation the end of
faith, loving kindness and truth the ground of all the former, Gods loving
kindness, or mercy moving him to promise, and his truth binding him to perform;
these are those Pearls that Christ by his Preachers casts before people, if
they be but as forward to take them, as he is to tender them: How beautiful
should the feet be of those that bring such glad tidings? and how heavy will
the dust of such feet be, shaken off against despisers?

O Lord them knowest] sc. That I have herein done mine utmost, and with an
upright heart.

Verse. 10. I have not bid thy righteousness within my heart] Or, if he did, as
Psalm. 119.11. it was, that having wrought it first on his own affections, he
might afterward utter it a cord ad cor, from the heart to the heart, and so
be able to save himself and these that heard him.

I have declared to faith (...) etc.] See verse. 9.

Verse. 11. Nune in luto adhuc baerens and cum residuo (...) precatur Deum.
With hold not (...) thy tender mercies, etc.] Whereas, while the Samts are on
earth there will be a perpetual interchange of comforts and crosses; prayers
must be joined with praises, and care taken, that confirmed by former
experiences, they (...) depend upon God.

Let thy loving kindness and thy ^^^th contin^ally preserve (...) ^^^ those two
Attributes of thine be mine Angel (...) at all times, See the Note on Psalm.
25.10.

Verse. 12. For innumerable evils have compassed me] Heb. Have mustered upon me.
Many (or Millions) are the troubles of the righteous; none our of Hell over
suffered more than they: an elegant exaggeration of their afflictions we have
in this verse, and such as cannot well be understood by any, but those that
have been well beaten Porters to the Cross of Christ.

Mine iniquities have taken hold upon me] i.e. The punishment of mine
iniquities, Genesis 4.13. my sin has found me out. If this be taken of Christ, he
is, Maximus patcatornus, the greatest of sinners by imputation, 2 Cor. 5.20.
Isa. 53. 6. for our sins (which here he calls his) he suffered; and here his
bitter Agony in the Garden is Graphically described; neither is it absurd to
say, that as he bore our sins in his own Body upon the Tree, he was first
redeemed by himself, and afterward we.

Therefore my heart fails me] i.e. my wit, courage, counsel is wasted by
earnest thinking upon them. Scientia mea eis numerandis defica, as Kimchi
glosseth,

Verse. 13. (...).
Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me] Do it of thy free grace, and mere mercy, of
thy good will, and gracious liking (as the word signifies) beside the
consideration of my woeful misery laid forth, verse. 12. as an object of thy
mercy.

Verse. 14. Let them be ashamed and confounded together, etc.] These and the
like imprecations must be looked upon as Prophecies. Besides, David looked upon
them not as his enemies only, but Gods as well and such also as were desperate,
and irrecoverable. So Paul prayed against the Copper-smith, the Church against
Jutian, etc.

Let them be driven backward, etc.] A Christian may without sin be sensible of
indignities; only it must be the mourning of Doves, and not the roaring of
Bears.

Verse. 15. Let them be desolate for a reward] a poor reward; but such as sin
pays to her servants; the wages of sin is death. Sin pays all her servants
in black money. See Psalm. 35.21. The ward here rendered reward, signifies an
heel. It is, as if the Prophet should say, Let one desolation tread upon the
heels of another, ^ill they be utterly undone.

Verse. 16. Let all those that seek thee rejoyce] viz. When they hear of my
deliverance. The Saints have both their joys and griefs in common with their
fellow members, as being in the body, Heb. 13.3. both in the body of Christ,
and in the body of sleth and frailty.

Verse. 17. But I am poor and needy] A stark beggar; neither will I hide from my
Lord (as once Joseph's Brethren said to him, when they came for com) mine
extreme indigency, my necessitous condition. I am one that gets my living by
begging.

Ye the Lord thinks upon met] He is the poor man's King, as has been said;
and Christ is (...), as Augustine has it; that is he gives with the Father,
and at same time prays with the suter, who must therefore needs speed.

Thou art my help and my deliverer, make no tarrying] Deliver me speedily,
lest I perish utterly. God, says One, is sometimes troubled with too much
help, but never with too little; we are sometimes too soon, but he is never too
late.

PSALM. XLI.
A Psalm of David] Of the same sense with the four former Psalms, says Kimchi.

Verse. 1. Blessed is his that considers the poor] Heb. That wise by (...)
concerning the poor; The poor weakling, whose health is impaired, whose wealth
is wasted. Austin renders it, Qui praeoccupat vocem (...), He that prevenreth
the request of the poor beggar; wisely considering his case, and not staying
till he ^^ave; which possibly out of modesty he may he Ioth to do. The most
interpret it of a charitable Judgment passed upon the poor afflicted, not
holding him therefore hated of God, because heavily afflicted, as Jobs friends
did. At vobis (...) sit qui de me quantumvis calamitoso rectius judicatis, so
Beza here paraphraseth; Well may you fare, my friends, who censi^^e better of
me, though full of misery; and deal more kindly with me. The word Mas^hil
signifies both a prudent Judgment, and a desire to do all good offices, Faith
One. It signifies to give comfort and instruction to the weak, faith Another,
wisely weighing his case, and ready to draw out, not his shea^ only, but his
soul to the hungry, Isa. 58.10. This is a blessed man, presupposing him to be a
Believer, and so to do it from a right Principle; viz. Charity out of a pure
heart, of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned, 1 Timothy 1.5.

The Lord will deliver him] i.e. The poor weakling; and the other also that
deals so mercifully with him; both shall be delivere; according to that of
our Savior, Matthew. 10.41. Delivered I say he shall be in due time; supported
in the mean while; a good use, and a good Issue he shall be sure of. Kimchi.
Some make it David's prayer, The Lord deliver him, etc. Others, the merciful
man's prayer for the poor-afflicted.

Verse. 2. The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive] Life in any sense, is
a singular mercy; Why is a living man sorrow full, Lam. 3.39? if he be alive,
though afflicted, he has cause to be thankful; how much more if alive to
Righteousness? The Arabic here interprets it, dabit (...) filios in quibus
post mortems vivat, he will give him Children, in whom he may live after his
death.

And he shall be blessed upon the earth] With wealth, and other accommodations;
so that the World shall look upon him as every way blessed.

And thou will not deliver him into the hands of his enemies] Heb. Do not thou
deliver him] This makes Kimchi conclude, that all this is but oration
visitantis consolatoria, the prayer of him that visits the sick man, for his
comfort.

Verse. 3. The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing] Whether
through sickness of body, as Isa. 38.2. or sorrow of heart; for in such case
also men cast themselves upon their beds, 1 Kin. 21.4. This God (and not the
Physicians) will do for the sick man, die septimo on the seventh day, says R.
Solomon, when he is at sickest.

Thou will make all his bed] Heb. Thou will turn, thou will stir up Po^hers
under him, that he may lie at ease; and this by the hand of those poor whom he
had considered. Or, Thou will turn all his bed, That is, his whole body from
sickness to health, as Kabvenaki senseth it.

Verse. 4. I said, Lord be merciful unto me, heal] Heal me in mercy, and
begin at the inside first. Heal my soul of sin, and then my body of sickness;
Heal me every whit. These to the end, are the sick man's words, says Kimchi.
And this is the Character of the Lords poor man, to whom the foresaid comforts
do belong, says Another.

For I have sinned against thee] He cries peccavi, not perit. Sanat ionom in
capite orditur, he begins at the right end.

Verse. 5. Mine enemies speak evil of mee] Notwithstanding my pity and
devotion; that is no target against persecution. David's integrity and the
severity of his discipline displeased these yokelesse Balialists; they were
sick of his strict government, and longed for a new King who would favor their
wicked practices; such as was absalom, whom they shortly after set up. David
they could not name, because be did Justice and Judgment to all the people.
These ^bertines were of the E^^^ (...) loquaces and ingeniesi in prafect (...)
eulpam, infamiam non effugiat, such as loved to speak evil of dignities; and
could not give their governors (how blameless soever) a good word.

When shall be dye, and his name perish?] Nothing less would satisfy their
malice, than utter extermination. But David recovereth, and his name surviveth,
when they lie wrapped up in the sheet of shame.

Verse. 6. And if he come to see mee] That is, Achitaphel, or some such
hollow-hearted Holophanta. Plaut. Ore pro mea sinitate orant sed cordequaerunt
malum. Midrash Tillin.


He speaks vanity] Pretending that he is very sorry to see me so ill at
ease; and letting fall some Crocodiles tears perhaps.

Has heart gathers iniquity to it self] As Toads and Serpents gather venom to
vomit at you.

When be goes abroad, be tells it] Boasting to his treacherous Brotherhood,
of his base behavior.

Verse. 7. All thas hate me, whisper together against mee] Heb. Mussitant, they
mutter as Charmers use to do. These whisperers are dangerous fellows, Romans
1.29. like the wind that creeps in by chinks in a wall, or cracks in a
window. A vente percolato, and inimice reconciliato, libera nos Demine, says
the Italian.

Against me do they devise] Cogitant quasi coagitant.

Verse. 8. An evil disease, say they, ^leaveth fast unto him] Heb. A thing of
Belial, Omnes impietates quas perpetravit.: R. Solom.
a vengeance has befallen him; God for his foul offense has put him over to
the Devil to be tormented by a pestilentiall disease, that will surely make an
end of him. So Genebrard (that mad dog) in the fourth book of his Chronology,
Anno Dom. 1564. reckoning up those diverse diseases whereof Calvin dyed (all
which was well known to be false) adds, An Herodes terribilius animam Satana
reddiderit, equidens nascio, whether Herod yielded up his soul to the Devil in
a more horrible manner, Lib. 5. cap. 1.
I know not. With as little charity did Evagrius say of Justinian the great
Lawgiver, ad supplicia justo Dei judicio apud inferos luenda profect us est,
he went to hell torments, Lib. de Miffi privats. Anno 1533.
when he dyed by Gods just Judgment. And Luther of Oecolampadius, se credere
Occolampadium ignit is Satane telis and have is confossum ^ubitanea morte
periisse. -- tant ^^e animis calestibus ire? This false conceit is sufficiently
confuted by the history of his life and death set forth by Simon Grynaus, as
also is that concerning Calvin, by his life written by Beza, and others.

Verse. 9. Yea mine own familiar friend] Heb. The man of my peace. This was a
great cut to David, (...), says Sophacles, what greater wound can there be
than a treacherous friend? such as was Abitophel to David, Judas to our
Savior, Brutus to Julius Casar (who was slain in the Senat-house with three
and twenty wounds, Ann Dom. 337
given for most part by them whose lives he had preserved) Magnentius to
Constans the Emperor, who had formerly saved his life from the Soldiers fury:
Michael Balbus to the Emperor Leo Armenius, whom he slew the same night that
he had pardoned and released him. This evil dealing made Socrates cry out,
(...), Friends, there is hardly a friend to be found; and Queen Elizabeth
complain, that in trust she had found Treason; and King Antigon^s pray to God
to preserve him from his friends; and King Alphonsus to complain of the
ingratitude of his Favorites.

In whom I trusted] So did not our Savior in Judas, for he knew him better
than so, and therefore this clause is left out, Joh. 13.18. where he applies
this saying to himself. Hiero^s and some others apply the whole Psalm to
Christ, and for that end they render these words actively, Cui credidi, to whom
I entrusted or committed my ministry.

Who did eat of my bread] My fellow-commoner, with whom I had eaten little less
than a bushel of Salt. A man's enemies are many times those of his own house,
the Birds of his own bosom. Judas dipped in the same dish with Jesus, be^rayed
him with a kiss. Caveatur of culuns I scarioticuns.

Has lif^ up his heel against me] Heb. Has magnified the heel, or the
feet-sole, sc. to supplant me, or to trample upon me, or to spurn against me.
Metaphera ab equis calcitre^ibus, says Vatablus, a Metaphor from unruly and
refractory Horses, See Judge. 15.8. it imports contempt, despite, and cruelty.

Verse. 10. But thou, O Lord, be merciful unte me] As storms beat a Ship into
the harbor: so did men's misusages drive David to God; and as Children meeting
with hard measure abroad, hye home to their Parents; so here.

And raise me up] From off this bed of weakness; and from under their feet of
insolency and cruelty.

That I may requite them] Not in a way of private revenge (for that was utterly
unlawful, and would not bear a prayer) but of Justice, as I am a King, and a
lawful Magistrate. The fear of this might happily make Ahitophel (foreseeing
that all would be naught on Absoloms side) to save the hangman a labor.

Verse. 11. By this I know that thou favourest mee] This is the triumph of
trust, and the fruit of faithful prayer; ever answered, sometimes before it is
uttered, sometimes in, and sometimes after the act; but we may be sure of an
un-miscarrying return, if we pray and not faint, Luke 18.1. even such as shall
bring us word, that God favors our persons.

Verse. 12. And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity] Which earth
and hell had conspired to rob me of, but in vain, through thy help. My shield
is yet in safety. My faith fails me not, nor yet mine innocence in regard of
men, or the Righteousness of my cause.

And set me before thy face for ever] So that being never out of thy
sight, I cannot possibly be out of thy mind. Confer 1 King. 17.1.

Verse. 13. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel] Thus he sweetly shuts up this
first book of the Psalms (as some distinguish) with a patheticall doxology,
redoubling his Amen, Fiat, Fiat, to show his fervency, and most earnest desire
that God should be blessed by his whole Israel. This was the custom of the
Scribes to do, says Kimchi, when they had finished any book. The other four
books of Psalms (as they are reckoned) end in like manner.

From everlasting to everlasting] i.e. From the beginning of the World, to the
end of it; or, as the Chaldee has it, from this World, unto the World to come.

Amen and Amen] So be it, and so it shall be. Dictio est acclamationis,
approbationis, and confirmationis. The Rabbines say, that our Amen in the close
of our prayers must not be first, hasty, but with consideration, 1 Cor. 14.16.
Secondly, nor maimed or defective; we must stretch out our hearts after it,
and be swallowed up in God. Thirdly, nor alone, or an Orphan; that is, without
faith, love, and holy confidence. The spirits of the whole prayer are
contracted into it, and so should the spirit of him that prays.

PSALM. XLII.
Maschil for the sons of Korah] Korah and his accomplices were swallowed up quick
by the earth in the Wilderness for their gainsaying, Number. 16. but some of his
sons disliking his practice, escaped, and of them came Heman (the Nephew of
Samuel) a chief singer, 1 Chronicles. 6.23. Now to him, and his Brethren, (...)
Nocumenta documenta.
was this and some other of David's Psalms committed, both to be kept as a
treasure; and to besung in the Sanctuary, for comfort and instruction under
affliction, according to the signification of the word Maschil; whereof See
Psalm. 3^. title.

Verse. 1. As the Heart pants after the water-brooks] Heb. As the Hind. Greek,
(...), for in females the passions are stronger, says an Interpreter here,
quicquid volunt, valde volunt. This Creature is naturally hot and dry, De not.
ani^ 1.6. cap. ^^
about Autumn especially (as Aristotle testifies)) but when hunted, extreme
thirsty. Chrysostom and Basil say, that she eats Serpents, and so is further
inflamed by their poison. Now as the hunted and heated Hind glocitat, breaths
and brayeth after the waterbrooks,

Sopanteth my soul after Thee, O God] He says, Amo te D^ mine plus quam (...)
mos, me. Ben
not after my former dignity and greatness, before Absolens disturbed me, and
drove me out (though he could not but be sensible of such a loss; we know
what miserable moans Cicere made, when fent into banishment; how impatient Cato
and many others were in like case, so that they became their own deathsmen) but
after Thee Lord, and the enjoyment of thy public ordinances; from which I am
now alas hunted and hindered. After that Gods holy Spirit has once touched a
soul, it will never be quier until it stands pointed Godward.

Verse. 2. My Soul thirsts for God] More than ever it did once for the wa^er
of the Well of Bethelem; and that, because he is the living God, the fountain
of living waters, that only can cooll and quench my desires, Jer. 2.13. and
17.13. so as I shall never thirst again, Joh. 4.14. whereas of all things else
we may say Quo plus sunt pota, plus sitiuntur aqua.

The Rabbines note here, Ovid. Kimchi. Aben-Ezra.
that David says not so hungreth, but so thirsts my soul; because men are
more impatient of thirst, than of hunger; they can go diverse days without
meat, Curt: ex Diodoro.
but not without drink. Alexander lost a great part of his army marching
through the Wilderness of the Susitans by want of water.

When shall I come and appear before God?] Heb. And see the face of God? viz.
in his Tabernacle. Eheu igitur quando tandem mibi miserrimo dabitur, ut te in
aede tua conspiciam? These earnest pantings, inquietations, and unsatisfiable
desires after God and his ordinances, are sure signs of true grace. But woe to
our worship-scorners, etc.

Verse. 3. My tears have been my meat day and night] Hunters say, the Heart
sheddeth tears, or something like tears, when he is pursued, and not able to
escape. Hereunto David might allude. Sure it is, that as Hinds by calving, so
men by weeping, cast out their sorrows, Job 39.3.

Expletur lachrymis egeriturque dolor. And, Act. and Mon. 1457.
Affert solatium lugentibus suspiriorum societ as says Basil, sighs are an
ease of sorrow. Of Mr. Bradford the Martyr it is reported, that in the midst of
dinner he used often to muse, having his hat over his eyes, from whence came
commonly plenty of tears dropping on his trencher. -- (...), The better any
are, So Psalm. 80.5.
the more inclined to weeping; as David than Jonathan, 1 Samuel 20. Here we have
him telling us that his tears were his meat, or his bread, as Gregory reads
it; and he gives this reason, that like as the more bread we eat, the dryer
we are, and the more thirsty; so the more tears of godly sorrow we let fall,
the more we thirst after that living fountain springing from above. David's
greatest grief was, that he was banished from the Sanctuary; and next to that,
the reproachful blasphemy of his enemies hitting him in the teeth with his
God, as if not able or not willing to relieve him now in his necessity, and
bitterly upbraiding him with his hopes as altogether vain.

Whiles they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?] Violenti certe
impetus, says Vatablus here; these were violent shocks indeed; and such as
wherewith David's faith might have been utterly overthrown, had it not been the
better rooted, and withal upheld by the special power of the Spirit of grace.
Other of Gods suffering Saints have met with the like measure. At Orleance in
France, as the bloody Papists murdered the Protestants, they cried out, where
is now your God? what is become of all your prayers and Psalms now? Let your
God that you called upon save you if he can. Mr. Clarks Genesis Martyrol. P. 316.
Others sang in scorn, Judge and revenge my cause O Lord; Others, Have mercy on
us Lord, etc. The Queen Mother of Scotland having received aid from France.
forced the Protestants for a while to retire to the High-Lands, whereupon she
scoffingly said, where is now John Knox his God? My God is now stronger than
his, yea even in Fife; but her braggs lasted not long; for within a few days,
Mr. Knox his life by Mr. Clark.
six hundred Protestants beat above four thousand French and Scots etc. Gods
Servants fare the better for the insolences of their enemies; who when they
say where is now their God? might as well say betwixt the space of the new, and
old Moon, where is now the Moon? when as it is never nearer the Sun, than at
that time.

Verse. 4. When I remember these things] viz. My present pressures compared with
my former happiness, Cic. de Fin. 1. 2. Sen. deben. 1.4. c. 22.
Miserum sane est, fuisse felicem. The Epicures held (but I believe they did
not believe themselves therein) that a man might be cheerful amidst the most
exquisite torments, Ex pr^teritarum upluptatum recordatione, by the remembrance
of his former pleasures and delights. David found this here but a slight and
sorry comfort, though he better knew how than any of them to make the best of
it; and his delights had been far more solid and cordial.

I pour out my soul] See Job 30.16. with the Note.

For I had gone with a multitude] Heb. A thick crowd, or throng of good peole,
frequ^^ting the public Ordinances, and David in the head of them. One renders
it, In umbra vel umbrella, sicut mos est Orientalium ambulare umbrellis contra
ardorem solis accommodatis.

I went with them to the house of God] Lent Itabam, I went with a gentle pace,
Gress^^ grallatorio. He speaks, says Vatablus, of the order observed by the
faithful when they went to the Sanctuary, viz. in comely equipage, singing
praise to God, Kimchi in (...) Radi^.
and confessing his goodness.

Verse. 5. Why art thou ^ast down, O my soul?] Here David seems to be Homo
divisus in duas parts, says Vatablus, a man divided into two parts, as indee
devery new man is two men: and what is to be seen in the Shulamite, but as it
were the company of two Armies? Cant. 6.13. David chideth David out of his
dumps. So did Alice Benden the Martyr, rehearsing these very words (when she
had been kept in the Bishops prison all alone, nine weeks with bread and water)
and received comfort by them in the midst of her miseries. Act. and Mon^ 1797.


And why art thou disquieted in me?] A good man's work lies most within doors;
he has more ado with himself than with all the world besides; he prays often
with that Ancient, Libera me Domine a malo homine meip so, Deliver me, Lord,
from that naughty man my self. How often do we punish our selves by our passions,
as the Lion, that beats himself with his own tail? Grief is like Lead to the
soul, heavy and cold, sinking it downward, taking off the wheels of it, and
disabling it for duty; like as a Limb that is out of joint, can do nothing
without deformity and pain. Keep up thy spirit therefore, and watch against
dejection, (...)
whatsoever befalls thee, yea against all distempers; since they hinder
comfortable intercourse with God, and that Spiritual composedness, that Sabbath
of spirit that we must enjoy, or else we cannot keep that continual Holy Day, 1
Cor. 5.8. How many are there who through unnecessary sadness, come to Heaven
before they are aware? Dr. Sibbes.


Hope thou in God] Faith quieteth the soul first or last (says a Reverend man
on these words) there will be stirring at the first: As in a pair of Balance,
there will be a little stirring when the weight is put in, till it come to a
poise; so in the soul, it comes not to a quiet consistency till there be some
victory of faith, till it rest and stay the soul.

For I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance] Heb. Homil. in
Genes.
The health^ of his countenance, Adhuc confitebor ei salutes vultus ejus.
Chrysostom brings in a man laden with troubles coming into the Church, where
when he heard this passage read, Why art thou cast down? hope in God, etc. he
presently recovered.

Verse. 6. O my God, my soul is cast down within me] Though before he had
schooled himself out of his distem pers, yet now he is troubled again: such are
the vicissitudes and interchanges of joy, and sorrow, that the Saints are here
subject unto: as soon as the Spirit gets the better, as soon the Flesh;
sometimes good affections prevail, sometimes unruly passions. Affections are
the wind of the soul, passions the storm. The soul is well carried, when
neither so becalmed that it moves not when it should, nor yet tossed with
tempests to move disorderly.

Therefore will I remember thee from the Land of Jordan] That is, says one, I
will call to mind former experiments there, and take comfort. Or, I will
remember thee, as I may, here at Mahanaim beyond Jordan, under the mount
Hermon, and that other little Hill (where I have found thee, in my meditations,
and prayers, propitious unto me) though I cannot now worship thee in the beauty
of holiness, being driven out by my ungracious Son Absalom, from the place
where thine honor dwells.

Verse. 7. Deep calls unto deep] Vorago voraginom advocat, i.e. one calamity
inviteth another: Aliud ex also malum, they come thick and threefold, Gurges
gurgitem excipit. Beza.
the Clouds return after the rain, Eccles. 12.2. as one shower is unburthened,
another is brewed. One affliction follows and occasioneth another, without
ceasing, or intermission; so that they are grown as it were to an infiniteness,
as Psalm 40.12.

At the noise of thy water-spouts] i.e. Thy Clouds pouring down amain, in a
storm at Sea especially, by a Cataclysm of waters falling at once out of the
Clouds, sometimes to the overwhelming and breaking of a ship. This, Mariners
call a spout, Psalm. 18.4. The floods of Belial made me afraid.

All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me] Fluctou fluctum trudit; yet
not, without the Lord: the enemies and the evils that befell him are called
Gods waves or breakings. Propter peccata noltra a te immiffa. Kimchi.


Verse. 8. Yet the Lord will command his loving kindness] He will after all this
misery send forth a Commission, and a command to set me free: and his Mandamus
will do it at any time.

And in the night his Song shall be with me] When others that are without God
in the World have restless nights, the gnats of cares and griefs molesting
them, a Saint can sing away care, and call his soul to rest, as Psalm. 116.7.
being filled with peace, and joy through believing; such as sets him a
singing to Gods glory.

And my prayer unto the God of my life] i.e. My Praises, which are a chief part
of prayer, 1 Timothy 26.1. Thanksgiving is an artificial begging, Gratiarum actio
est adplus dandum invitatio.

Verse. 9. I will say unto my God, nay Rock, why have thou forgotten me?] Tene
ve^^ mei immemoremesse? Thus I will in a familiar manner expostulate with him,
and lay my case open unto him, as to a friend. The flesh suggesteth that he is
forgotten, but faith holds its own, fastening on the Rock of ages.

Why go I mourning] Heb. Black, as one that is in mourning weeds: or, that had
lain among the pots.

Verse. 10. As with a sword in my bones] Heb. A murdering weapon, which when
thrust into the bones causes most exquisite pain: so deeply was good David
affected with the dishonor done to God by his blasphemous enemies; it went to
the very heart of him as a dagger.

While they say daily] See the Note on verse. 3.

Verse. 11. Why art thou cast down] See verse. 5.

Who is the kealth of my countenance] i.e. The Author of my manifold, present
and apparent safety: such as shall make me look blithe and beautiful, cheery,
and chirp.

PSALM. XLIII.
Verse. 1. Judge me O God] This Psalm is as it were an Epitome, or an Appendix
to the former, and little differing in words or matter.

Plead my cause] See Psalm. 35.1.

Against an ungodly Nation] Heb. A Nation not mild, or merciful: so he calls
Absoloms Accomplices, who sought and would have sucked his blood. Such are a
people of Gods wrath, and of his curse.

O deliver me, etc.] From Absalom, or Abitophel, or the whole Faction.

Verse. 2. For thou art the God of my strength] As being in Covenant with me
both offensive and defensive: In the Lord Jehovah is a Rock of ages, or
everlasting strength, Isa. 26.4. for God of my strength, Psa. 42.9. is my Rock.

Why go I mourning] See Psalm. 42.9.

Verse. 3. Lux and veritas piorum comites.
O send out thy light] i.e. thy comforting grace, opposed to that verse. 2. I go
mourning, or in black.

And thy truth] i.e. Thy faithfulness, opposed to the deceitful man, verse. 1.
The Rabbines interpret Light and Truth, by Christ and Elias; the Arabic makes
it a prayer for the Jews conversion.

Let them bring me unto thy holy bill] Zion, the place of holy assemblies for
Gods service. Iterum commendatur hic dignit as ministerii Publici: Vaeigitur
illis qui caducorum bexeruns usum redimunt sacri, ministerii jactura, qui
conciones ^acras and Sacramenta ultro negligunt, etc.

And to thy Tabernacles] Socalled, either because it was set up at sundry times
in sundry places, whilst it was tranfportative; or else because it was parred
by veiles into several rooms, Heb. 9.2, 3.

Verse. 4. Then will I go muto the Altar of God] Not without store of
Sacrifices. Gods service is now nothing so costly; and should therefore be more
cheerfully performed. Heathens had their Altars, etc. all save the Ferfiaus.

Verse. 5. Why art thon bowed down, etc.] See Psalm. 42.9. and 11.

PSALM. XLIV.
MAschil] i.e. Making wise, or giving instruction; for which purpose this Psalm
was composed by David (as it is most probable) or some other excellent Prophet,
for the use of the Church, which is hares crucis, the heir of the Cross, as
Luther speaks; and is here instructed how to carry her self under it, and to
get benefit by it.

Verse. 1. We have heard with our ears] i.e. We have both heard and heeded it,
with utmost attention and affection. It is not a Pleonasmus; but an Emphasis
that is here used.

Our Fathers have told us] According to that they were commanded, Deuteronomy. 6. and
elsewhere, to whet good things upon their young Children, and to propagate the
memory of Gods noble acts to all posterity, Exodus 12.26. and 13.14. Josh. 4.6,
In Ioe.
7. See Psalm. 78.4, 6. Hear this says Basil, and blush ye Fathers, that
neglect to teach your Children. They made their mouths as it were Books,
wherein the noble acts of the Lord might be read to his praise, and to the
drawing of their Childrens hearts unto him.

What work thou didst] All which they faithfully related, and carefully
recorded for the use of after-ages, Psalm. 102.18. This shall be written for
the generation to come; and the people that shall be created, shall praise the
Lord.

Verse. 2. How thou did drive out the Heathen] i.e. The Canaanites. These, God
the great Proprietary of all supplanted, after that they had for a long time
grown there as trees, and abounded with all kind of sensual delights till they
had filled the Land from one end to the other with their uncleanness, Ezra
9.11.

How thou did afflict (or break in pieces) the people and cast them out] Or,
cause them (the Israelites) to spread and propagate. (So Mollerus reads it)
as the Vine sends out her branches.

Verse. 3. For they got not the Land in possession by their own sword, etc.] Men
are apt to arrogate to themselves, and say as Luther has it, Herod. lib.
Hoc ego feci. Sesostris King of Egypt, when he had conquered any Country, was
wont to set up pillars, and thereupon to engrave these words, This Land I got
in possession by mine own power. He was afterward slain by his own servants.

But thy right hand] Quiaper eam praelia and opera facta sunt, faith Kimchi.
God is the great Doer in all achievements.

And the light of thy countenance] i. e. Illustris praesentia tua qua
praeivisti and praeluxistie^s, thy gracious presence and conduct. Junius.


Because thou had a favor unto them] Free grace was the fundamental cause
of all their felicity. God loved them because he loved them, Deuteronomy. 7.7. He
chose them of his love, and then loved them for his choice.

Verse. 4. Thou art my King O God] Heb. Thou art be my King. Cr. Thou art the
same my King. i.e. the same that thou wast to those of old; Oh see to thy
subjects, as ever thou have done.

Command deliverances for Jacob] A Mandamus from thee will do it; He spoke the
word, and it was done. Some read it, command deliverances O Jacob, that is, O
God of Jacob, as Psalm. 24.6.

Verse. 5. Through thee will we push down our enemies] Cor^^-p temus, a metaphor
from horned creatures, as Deuteronomy. 33.17. This we shall soon do, if thou do but
only give the word of command; for together with they word goes forth a power.

Through thy name] Tuo nomine and numine, auspicio and ductu.

Verse. 6. For I will not trust in my bow] To trust in men or means, is the
ready rode to utter ruin. Idas one of the Argonautes is brought in by the
Poet, bragging that he trusted not in the gods, but in his own arm, and arms.

(...)
(...)
What need we to fear the Turks (said Sigismund the young King of Hungary in
his pride and jollity) who need not at all to fear the falling of the heavens,
Turk. hist. 10
which if they should fall, yet were we able with our spears and halberds to
hold them up for falling upon us? He, shortly after this, received a notable
overthrow. Carnal confidence ends in confusion.

Verse. 7. But thou have saved us] Thou have wrought and fought for us against
those that sought to destroy us. Thou have, and therefore thou will, for thou
art the same my King, verse. 4.

Verse. 8. In God we boast all the day long] The Spaniards are said to be great
boasters in the very lowest ebb of fortune. A godly man may be, and must be so
by an holy gloriation; he must make his boasts of such a King immortal,
invisible, etc. The three Children did so: Our God can deliver us, etc.

And praise thy Name] Thou alone shall have the praise of all our prosperity.

Verse. 9. But thou have cast off, and put us to shame] Here Is a sudden change,
and a sad complaint, but handsomely brought in, the better to insinuate, the
sooner to prevail for redress. Only this, it should have been remembered that
the Lords hand was not shortened -- but their iniquities bad separated between
them and their God, Isa. 59.1, Niceph. l. 11. c. 40.
2. That noble General Trajan told Valens the Arrian Emperor, that by warring
against God, he had abandoned the Victory, and sent it to the enemies.

Verse. 10. Thou make us to turn back from the enemy] By expectorating our
faith and courage, and leaving us to a fearful faint-heartedness, that flies
at the found of a shaken leaf. God strengthens or weakneth the arm of either
Army, Ezekiel. 30.24.

Verse. 11. Thou have given us like sheep appointed for meat] Aliqui occisi,
dispersialii, and veunndati gratis, Aben-Ezra.
Some of us are slain, others scattered here and there, and sold for naught.

And have scattered us, etc.] O the many miseries of such a banishment! The
Poet thus expresses it.

Est miserum, patria amissa laribusque vagare:
Mendica and timida voce rogare cibos.
Cumnatisque errare suis, and conjuge mocsta,
Et cum matre pia, cumque parente seen. Tyrteus.

Verse. 12. Thou sellest thy people for nonght] Thirty for a penny the Jones
were sold by the Romans, says Josephus, at the last devastation.

And do not increase thy wealth by their price] Thou take thy first Chapman
(as the Pope gave England, in Hen. 8. his time, Primo occupaturo, to him that
could first seize it) and have not made thy best of them; but given them away,
for whom thou wast wont to give great Nations, Isa. 43.3. All the comfort in
this case was, that yet they were dear to God as his Sons, though sold for
slaves to the enesnies, as may be seen Isa. 50 1. and 52.3.

Verse. 13. Thou make us a reproach to our neighbours] This to a generous
spirit is very grievous. The Cappadocians were noted for a servile people; and
Tiberius said of his Romans, Ammian. 1.2.
that they were homines ad servitutem parati. The Jews at this day hear ill
among all Nations, for a nasty and sordid people. O Marcomanni, O Quadi, O
Sarmats, tandem alios vobis deteriores inveni, said that Emperor, O Marcomans,
O Quades, O Sarmatians, I have at length found a more odious and contemptible
people than you are any; meaning the Jews, with whose stench he was much
annoyed.

Verse. 14. Thou make us a byword among the Heathen] Who use to say, As base
as a Jew, as wretched as an Israelite, etc. The Turks at this day say, Judaeus
sim si fallam, If I be not as good as my word, count me a very Jew. We use to
say, As bard-hearted as a Jew. Thus is fulfilled that which was threatened,
Deuteronomy. 28, 37. 1 King. 9.7. Jer. 24 9.

Verse. 15. My confusion is continually before me] Heb. All the day long, or
every day; so as that there is neither hope of better, nor place of worse.

Verse. 16. For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth] Reproacheth
Religion, blasphemeth God and his people, as if he cared not what became of
them; and his dispensation seems to say as much: this reflecteth upon the
Saints, and makes them cry out --

-- Pudet hac opprobria nobis,
Et dici potuisse, and non potuisse refelli.
Verse. 17. All this is come upon us, yet] This they allege, viz. their
constancy, as an argument of their sincerity, and a motive to pity; apply this
with Hierom, to Christians, and then it is the voice of Martyrs.

Neither have we dealt falsely in thy Covenant] i.e. We have not relinquished
the true Religion, or revolted to dumb Idols: but held us close to they sincere
service. And therefore if that Heathen Emperor going against his enemy could
say, Non sic Deos coluimus ut ille nos vinceres, We have not so served the gods
that they should serve us no better, than to suffer us to be worsted; Autoni.
Philosoph.
How much more may Gods faithful Servants be confident of his help, and say,
All people will walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the
name of the Lord our God for ever and ever? Mic. 4.5.

Verse. 18. Our heart is not turned back] Metaphora a study, says Vatablus, As
those that run a race stand not at a stay, much less turn back again; so
neither have we either stopped or stepped backward, but advanced still toward
the mark, having Nondum metam ( We have not yet attained) for our Motto, as
Saint Paul had; Phil. 1.28. 1 Pet. 3.6.
Phil. 3.12. being in nothing terrified by our adversaries, nor afraid with any
amazement.

Neither have our steps declined] We have watched over every particular action;
Gods people are best when at worst.

Verse. 19. Though thou have sore broken us in the place of Dragons] i.e. Gr
(...)
In Deserts haunted by Dragons. (See Isa. 34.13. and 35.7.) Whereinto we are
driven in banishment, and there have crushed us, and covered us with the shadow
of death, i.e. deadly calamity.

Verse. 20. If we have for got ten the name of our God] i.e. forgone our
Religion, as Renegadoes, denying the Lord that bought us. In the time of the
Maccabees, many revolted to Paganism; Daemas forsaking Paul, became an
Idolatrous Priest at Thessalonica, says Dorotheus; Julian turned Pagan;
Damascen Mohammedan, as some write; Harding an obstinate Papist. In the
Palatinate, when, not forty years since, taken by the Spaniard, scarce one man
in twenty stood out, but fell to Popery, as fast as leaves fall in Autumn.

Or stretched out our bands to a strange God] This, Ignatius, Laurentius, and
thousands of those Primitive Christians would dye, rather than be drawn to do.
So the three Children, the seven Brethren, etc. Origin, for yielding a little,
was excommunicated.

Verse. 21. Shall not God search this out?] What pretenses or excuses soever be
used for the coloring, and covering of the same.

For he knows, etc.] See Mat. 10.26. with the Note.

Verse. 22. Yea for thy sake are we ki^ed, etc. q. d. Thou know that for thy
sake, Potes videre hominem morte affici quare mortificetur nescis. Aug. Act.
and Mon. 8^
(and not for vain glory, or out of pertinacy, etc.) we are killed. It Is the
cause, and not the punishment, that makes the Martyr. Some suffer as
Malefactors rather.

We are counted as sheep for the slaughter] As those Christians in Calabria,
Anno 1560. thrust up in one house together, as in a Sheepfold, and butchered
severally. See Romans 8.36. besides those many, whose names being written in red
Letters of blood in the Churches Calender, are written in golden Letters in
Christ's Register in the book of life, as Prudentius has it.

Verse. 23. Awake, why sleep thou?] Considering all the premises, stir up thy
self, and come and save us; carest thou not that we perish?

Verse. 24. Wherefore hidest thou thy face?] God sometimes concealeth his love,
as Joseph did, out of increasement of love: he retireth, but faith fetches him
out, as the Woman of Canaan did, Mark 7.24, 25.

Verse. 25. For our soul, etc.] Soul and Belly (or body) both are oppressed, and
lie suppliant at Gods feet; resolved there to live and dye together.

Verse. 26. Arise for our help] Heb. A help for us, a sufficient help,
proportionable to our necessities. The Hebrew bath a letter more than ordinary.

PSALM. XLV.
UPon Shoshannim] The name of an Instrument with six strings, faith Kimchi. Or,
Cant. 2.1, 2. Steph, de urb.
concerning the Lillies, that is, the Messiah and his people, faith Kabuenaki.
The City Shusan had its name from Lillies there plentifully growing; as Rhodos
from Roses, Florence from flowers, etc.

Maschil] It is not said (as elsewhere) of David; and yet some will have him to
have been the penman; others, Solomon; epitomizing his book of Canticles; with
which indeed it is of the self-same argument, viz.

Asong of loves] An Epithalamium or nuptial verse, made at the marriage of
Solomon and the Shulamite. As for Pharaohs Daughter, diverse good Divines are
of opinion, that neither here, nor in the Canticles any respect is had, or
allusion made to that match of Solomon with her, so expressly condemned by the
Holy Ghost, 1 King. 11. ut perabsurdum mihi videatur, illud matrimonium
existimare fuisse tante rei typum, faith learned Beza. Ainsworth renders it, A
song of the well-beloved Virgins, friends of the Bridegroom and Bride, verse.
9.14. to set forth Christ in his glory, and his Church in her beauty. So when
Hieron had freed the Locrians from the tyranny of Anaxilas and Cleophron, the
Virgins sang his praise, as is to be read in Pindarus his Odes; which Politian
preferred before David's Psalms, ausu nefario, Pind. Pi. 2.
like an Atheist as he was.

Verse. 1. Exordium ut vocant floridum.
My heart is enditing a good matter] Heb. Fryeth, sicut qua in sartagine
friguntur, as things are fried in a drying pan, Levit. 7.9. The Prophet, being
to sing of such a sublime subject, would not utter any thing but what he had
duly disgested, thoroughly thought upon, and was deeply affected with. What an
high pitch flies St. Paul, whenever he speaks concerning Christ? See Ephesians.
1.6. and 2.4, 7. and 3.19. The like is reported of Origin, Nusquam non ardet,
faith Erasmus; sed nusquam est ardentior quam ubi Christi sermones actusque
tractet; that he was ever earnest; Praefat. ad Origin. opera.
but most of all, when he discoursed of Christ. Of Johannes Mollias a Bononian
it is said, Act. and Mon. sol. 855.
that whenever he spoke of Jesus Christ, his eyes dropped; for he was
fraught with a mighty fervency of Gods holy Spirit; and like the Baptist, he
was first a burning (boiling or bubling) and then a shining light. Ardor mentis
est lux Doctrinae.

I speak of the things which I have made touching the King] Or, I will speak in
my works, that is in this Psalm, concerning the King, viz. Solomon, and Him
that is greater than Solomon in all his glory, Christ the King of the Church.
Works he calls this Poem, not for the greatness, but for the exquisiteness
thereof; it being breve and longum planeque aureum; utpote in quo universa pane
salutis nostrae mysteria continentur, as containing almost all the mysteries of
man's salvation.

My tongue is the pen of a ready writer] i. e. I will roudly and readily relate
what I have so well ruminated; and dexterously deliver my most mature
meditations concerning the mystical marriage of Christ and his Church. This is
a good president for Preachers. Demosthenes would have such a one branded for a
pernicious man to the Commonwealth, who durst propose any thing publicly,
which he had not beforehand seriously pondered. And Aristides being pressed
to speak to something propounded ex tempore, answered; propound to day, and I
will answer to morrow; for we are not of those that spit or spue up things, etc.

Verse. 2. Valde palchiui^i. Vat.
Thou art fairer than the Children of men] Heb. Thou art double-fairer; the
Hebrew word is doubled, ad corroborandum, faith Kimchi. It may very well be,
that Solomon was, for his beauty, another Nireus; and for his eloquence,
another Nestor; Lentulus ad Senate. ap. Magdeb. cent: 1.
wisdom might make his face to shine. Of Christ we are sure, that his body
being of the finest temperament, and no way diseased, could not be but very
beautiful. The Roman register reports him to have been of a reverend
countenance, his stature somewhat tall, his hair after the color of the ripe
hazel-nut, his forehead smooth and plain, his face without wrinkle, mixed with
moderate red, his eyes gray, various, and clear, etc. Surely if Stephens face
was as the face of an Angel, and if with his bodily eyes he could pierce the
heavens, and see there what he would; How much more could the Lord Christ,
whose very manhood came the nearest unto God of any that ever was or could be?
His very countenance did express a divinity in him. And what if to the Jews,
who esteemed him not, but maligned him, and crucified him, he had neither form
nor beauty, Isa. 53.2? what if he were so broken at thirty three years of age,
with continual paids and grief for them, that they judged him wel-nigh fifty,
Job. 8.57? yet he was every way complete and comely above all the Children of
men; yea above all the Angels in heaven: for in him the Godb^^d dwelt bodily,
Col. 2.9. and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
Father, full of grace and truth, Joh. 3.14. His soul was like a rich pearl in a
rough shell; like the Tabernacle, Goats-hair without, but gold within; or as
Erutus his staff, enjus ensue soliduns aurum ^ernto vilabatur cortice. He was
all glorious within; had a fullness of grace above that of Adam, Joh. 1.16. as
much as a Creature was capable of; Plutarch.
and more near familiarity with the Godhead, than any creature.

Grace is poured into shy lips] So that thou can gracefully deliver thy self
in a set speech. Solomen could, no doubt, as another Phacion or Pericles; in
whose lips, (...) (said Eupolis) sat a strange persuasive faculty; so that he
could prevail with the people at his pleasure. Jesus Christ could much more do
so; for together with his words there went forth a power; he spoke as never man
spoke he spoke with authority, and not as the Scribes; all that heard him
wondered at; the words of grace that proceeded out of his mouth, Luke 4.22. Isa.
50.4.

Therefore God bath blessed thee] Or better, because that God has blessed
thee, and endowed thee with such gifts and graces.

Verse. 3. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty] This is one of Christ's
titles, Isa. 9.6. the Giant, or the mighty strong God, O Heros^
the valliant Champion of his Church. And his sword is the word of his mouth,
Rev. 1.16. Heb. 4.12. Isa. 49.2. All the wars in the conquest of Canaan were
types of the spiritual wars under the Gospel, whereby the Nations were subdued
to the obedience of the faith, 2 Cor. 10.4. Ephesians. 6.11. Christ has his sword
then, a two-edged sword; and he is here called upon to gird it to his thigh
(after the manner of those Easterlings, as we do our skeans, bangers,
woodknives) that is, to take unto him his authority, and to exercise it for the
conversion of his people, and confusion of his enemies. Additur ^i gladius quem
non ostentet velut (...), sed quem etium destring at. A sword he has, not for
show, but for service; whence it is added, with thy glory and thy Majesty.
Equita super verbum verit^tis.


Verse. 4. And in thy Majesty ride prosperously] Heb. Prosper thou, ride thou
upon the Word of truth, of meekness and of Righteousness. q. d. Ride thou in
thy triumphant Charret, as it were drawn by those three glorious graces, Truth,
Meekness, and Righteousness; and governed by the Word, as by the Charter-man;
Cui divinissim a allegory explicand a pro rei gravisate ac dignitate integro
volumine opus esset, says B^za, For the explaining of which most divine
allegory, according to the worth of it, a whole volume might well be full
written. The Kings of the earth for most part have their Charrets drawn by
other horses, viz. Pride, Ambition, Cruelty, etc. as Sesostres King of Egypt,
Qui Pharios currus regum cervicibus egit.

And thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things] i. e. Shall enable thee
to perform them. Christ riding on his white horse (his Apostles and Preachers)
went forth conquering, and to conquer, Rev. 6.2. Solomon was no such sword-man
as was Jesus Christ.

(...) Verse. 5. Thine arrows are sharp, etc.] Peter's converts were pricks at
heart; Act. 1. Act. 7.54.
and Stephens heaters were cut to the heart; Christ can fetch in his rebelts
afar off; he has arrows as well as a sword, to wound them; that men may
either bend or break, yield, or become his footstool; One way or other he will
surely have the better of them.

Verse. 6. Thy throne, O God] Here the Prophet directe^h his speech not to
Solomon (who never took upon him the name of God, as did Sosostris King of
Egypt, Antiochus, (...) Caligula, and some other proud Princes) but to Christ,
Heb. 1.8. who is God, blessed for ever, (...), not so called by an excellency
only, as the Angels are, Psalm. 8.9. with Heb, 2. not by Office and Title only,
as Magistrates are gods^ Ps. 82.16. nor Catachrestically and Ironically so
called, as the Heathen gods, nor a diminutive god, inferior to the Father, as
Arrius held, but God by nature, every way Co-essential, Coeternal, and
Coequal with the Father, and the Holy Chost, Joh. 1.1. Phil. 2.6. 1 John 5.20.
Hold this last; for it is the Rock, Mat. 16.16. it is of the very foundation:
so that if we believe it not, there is no heaven to be had, 1 John 5.20. As for
his Kingly Office here described, it belongs to him as Mediator, and what is
here spoken of him is to be understood of his whole person; for so is he Head
of the Church, and King of Israel, for ever.

The scepter of thy Kingdom, etc.] Thy government is not with rigor, but with
righteousness, thou came rightly by it, casting out Satan the Usurper, Mat.
12.29. Heb. 2.14. and do most righteously administer it, Deuteronomy. 4.8.

Verse. 7. Haec vere heroica est nemesis.
Thou love right eousness; and hate wickedness] Solomon did so for a great
while (may Nero's first five years were such, that Trajan was wont to say, that
none ever attained to the perfection of them) but Christ continually; neither
can he do otherwise. See Matthew. 3.10, 11, 12. Joh. 5.30. Matthew. 12.18, 19, 20.

Therefore God thy God has anoynted] i.e. For which purpose God has anointed
thee his Messiah, or Christ, Psalm. 2.2.

With the oil of gladness] Quia totus mundus in unctione Christi and ejus
missione letabitur, says Kimchi; so called, because the whole World should be
cheared up by the Unction and Mislion of Messiah; he received the Spirit
without measure, that of his fullness we might all receive and grace for grace,
righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

Above thy fellows] i.e. Exreliquorum regum numero eximendus, above all earthly
Potentates; Beza.
the best whereof (as David, ^o sish) had their faults, and flaws; or rather
above thy Saints, thy fellow-brethren by grace, and Coheirs of glory; they
have Plenitudinem V asis, but thou, Fontis; neither only art thou anointed Pre
consortibus, above thy fellows, but Pro consortibus, for those thy fellows, as
some render it, Dioscor. l. 1. c. 67. and l. 3. c. 82: and lib: l. 12 Lib. 1.
Antidot.
and it is very comfortable.

Verse. 8. All thy garments smell of myrrbe, aloes and cassia] Things not only
of good savor, but of great price, Myrrbe some take to be Musk, Aloes Amber,
Cassia, a kind of Ginnamon, which in Galeas time was very rare and hard to be
found, except in the storehouses of great Princes. And Pliny reports, that a
pound of Cinnamon was worth a thousand Denarii, that is, an hundred and fifty
Crowns of our (...). This description then of Christ's clothing, does
allegorically set forth the sweetness and pleasure that the Father finds in
him ((...), Mat. 3.17.) and that we also find, whilst he is made unto us of
God, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption, 1 Cor. 1.30.
(Confer 2 Cor. 2.14.) and that out of his Ivory palaces, i.e. his heavenly
habitation, from which he beholds us, and raineth down righteousness upon us.

Whereby they have made thee glad] i.e. Servi and sodales tui, thy fellow
friends and servants, who stand and hear the Bridegroom, and rejoice greatly by
reason of his voice, Joh. 3.29. yea make him glad by their ready obedience,
setting the Crown upon his head, and adorning him as it were with all his
bravery in the day of his espousals. Cant. 3.11. and making him say, How fair,
how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! Cant. 7.6.

Verse. 9 Kings daughters were among thine honorable women] Thy Ladies of
honor attending upon thy royal Consort (for after the description of Christ,
the Bridegroom, follows another of the Queen, his Bride, and of the royal
Nuptials) Or, Kings daughters are in thy preciousnesses, that is, in thy
comeliness that thou have put upon them, Ezekiel. 16.14. for all the Churches
bravery is borrowed, and all her Daughters, i.e. Members, are adorned not with
their own proper attire, Sed regio mundo and ornatu, out of the King Christ's
Wardrobe; this is the righteousness of the Saints, Rev. 19.8. viz. imputed, and
imparted.

Upon thy right band] Which is a place of Dignity and Safety. As Christ is at
the Fathers right hand; so the Church is at Christ's right hand; where, as his
wife, she shines with her Husbands beams. This is very comfortable.

Did stand the Queen] Heb. Augusta.
the wife, adjutorium illi exacts respondens, as Genesis 2.18. says (...), that
he was happy in his wife, a Lady of excellent virtue, who drew evenly with him
in all the courses of honor that appertained to her side; Daniels hist.
and seemed a piece so just cut for him, as answered him rightly in every joint.

Verse. 10. Hearken O Daughter, and consider, incline thine ear] The Prophets,
or rather Christ's Counsel to the Church, and each Member thereof, wholly to
deny ungodliness and wordly lusts, and to live soberly, Tit. 3.12.
righteously and godly in this present World; to leave all, and to cleave to
Christ. This, because it is soon said, but not so soon done, He presses in
many words all to one purpose, Hearken, see, incline thine ear. Self-denial is
a most difficult duty, and yet so necessary, that if it be not done, we shall
be undone.

Forget also thine own people, etc.] All evil opinions must be unlearned, and
all evil practices abandoned, and all our love transferred, and transfused
upon Christ; or we cannot be a fit Spouse for him. Christ's Spouse must (as
Deuteronomy. 21.11, 12, 13.) shave her head, pare her nails, and bewail her Father and
Mother, that is, her natural inbred evils and corruptions.

Verse. 11. So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty] If thou deny thy self
and forgo all others to please him alone, he shall set his whole heart upon
thee, and be ravished with thy love, as Prove. 5.19. How could that Persian
Ladies Husband do less than love her, who having been at Cyrus his wedding,
and asked how she liked the Bridegroom? Like him, said she? I know not how I
like him; for I looked upon no man there, but mine own Husband. Aspasia Milesia
was very dear to Cyrus, because she was (...), Fair, and withal Wise. Aelian.


For he is thy Lord] And therefore not to be slighted by thee, for his great
love, as many of the Persian Monarchs were ( Ahashuerosh for instance) but
reverenced and obeyed, as Augustus was by his wife Livia.

Verse. 12. And the Daughter of Tire shall be there With a gift] Isa. 23.18. The
Tyrians, that wealthy people, when once converted (think the same of other
Nations) shall leave hoarding and heaping; and find another manner of
Merchandise and employment of their substance, viz. to feed and cloth Gods
Saints, and maintain his Ministers.

Verse. 13. The Kings Daughter is all glorious within] In the Inner-man, Ephesians.
3.16. the hidden man of the heart, 1 Pet. 3.4. Great is the glory of the new
Creature; but not discerned by the World, through which the Saints must be
content to pass as concealed persons; and not think much to have the greater
part of their warein the inner part of their shop, and not all on the board or
stall.

Her clothing is of wronght gold] ex vestibus auro ocellatis. Clothed she is
with humility, and other golden graces; as with that party-colored garment,
whereby Kings Daughters, as Tamar, were anciently distinguished from others.

Verse. 14. She shall be brought] See the Note on verse. 13. she shall be
presented to Christ a glorious Church, not having spot, wrinkle, or any such
thing, Ephesians. 5.27. Rev. 21.2.

Verse. 15. With gladness and rejoycing] As at marriages is usual. Sampsons
wife, solecised in weeping at such a feast. Oh the joy! the joy! said that
dying Saint. But what in the meanwhile?

Verse. 16. In stead of thy Fathers, etc.] The Church shall still bring forth
Children to her Husband Christ, and there shall be a succession of his name,
Psalm. 72.17.

Whom thou may make Princes] The Saints are Kings in Righteousness, though
somewhat obscure ones as was Melchiscdech.

Verse. 17. I will make thy name, etc.] This is a second benefit promised to the
Church, viz. everlasting renown, with highest estimation and imitation, to the
Worlds end.

PSALM. XLVI.
Upon Alamoth] i.e. Upon the Virginals. Virgins with their shril treble tune 1
Chr^^. 15.20. used (belike) to sing this triumphant Psalm, and to play it on
the Instrument; and their hearts were somewhat suitable to it. The penman some
think to have been David, upon occasion of those notable victories, 2 Samuel 8.
Others, Solomon; for the Virgins to sing and play at his wedding, Psalm. 45.8,
9. with Cant. 1.2. Others, Isaiah; either upon the overthrow of those two
Kings, Rezin and Pekah, 2 King. 16.5. Isa. 7. and 8. confer Judge. 5.11. or else
after the slaughter of Sennacheribs army by an Angel; then the Virgin Daughter
of Zion, (much more than before) despised him, and laughed him to scorn: the
Daughter of Jerusalem shook her head at him, Isa. 37.22. and sang as follows.

Verse. 1. Tremel.
God is our resuge and strength] Them nobis est receptus, and robur. All
Creatures, when in distress, run to their resuges, Prove. 30.26. Psalm. 104.18.
Prove. 18.11. Dan. 4.10, 11. Judge. 9.50, 51. So do the Saints to God Almighty,
for the safe-guarding of their persons, as here, and Isa. 25.4. Luther, when in
greatest distress, was wont to call for this Psalm; saying, Let us sing the
forty sixth Psalm in consort; and then let the Devil do his worst.

A very present help in trouble] Or, Joh. Manlii loc. com.
We have abundantly found him an help in tribulation. God, as he is not far
off his people at such a time, so he needs not much entreaty; but when we are
nearest danger, he is nearest to deliver, as in the Gun-pouder-plot prevented
eight or nine hours before it should have been acted; Masses were sung in
Rome, for the prospering of it; but no prayers particularly made in England,
for the preventing, nor could be. Here God was, if ever, auxilium
praesentissimum.

Verse. 2. Therefore will we not fear, though the earth, etc.] No not in the
greatest concussions of States, and revolutions in nature. Earthquakes are very
dreadful, and lay whole Cities on heaps sometimes (as Antioch often, which was
therehence called (...)) but though not some part only, but the whole earth
should be turned topsy-turvy, 1 ege Plindib. 2, cap. 83. and 88.
as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down, 2 King. 21.13.
yea though heaven and earth should be mingled, Heb. 13.26. in this also the
Believer would be confident, because God is with him ( Psalm. 23.4. and 27.1.)
whose praise and promise is, to see to his Servants safety in the greatest
dangers, and to set them out of the gunshot.

And though the Mountains be carried into the midst of the Sea] Though all the
World should be reduced again into that first Chaos of confusion.

Si fract us illab at ur orbis, Horat. Od. 3. Lib. 3.

Impavidum forlent ruina.
Verse. 3. U: omnes procellae horriblli cum boatu circumsonent. Ethic. 3.7.
Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled] Heb. Be mudded; yet we will
not fear, viz. with a base distrustful fear. Tanti est experientiam sensunique
auxilii divini habere. The tempestuous rising and roaring of the Sea is so
terrible, that Aristotle says, whosoever fears it not, is either mad, or
senseless. Fear not, says the Angel to St. Paul himself in that dreadful
storm, Act. 27.24. which implies, that he was afraid with a natural fear; and
he might be so without sin. An a wefull fear of God is consistent with faith;
neither is any Believer guilty of a Stoical apathie. The very Devils believe
and tremble, Jam. 2.19. The A postles word there implies, that they roar as
the Sea roareth, and shrieke horribly.

Though the Mountains shake, etc.] As sometimes Promontories fall with the
force, Id quod Propheta miris verborum figuris additis illustrate Beza.
and impetuous beating of the Sea upon them. Admit all this, and more (whether
in a sense literal, or allegorical; set forth it is in a strain high and
hyperbolicall) yet we will bear up, and be bold to believe, that all shall go
well with us.

Verse. 4. there is a River, etc.] Interea civitas Dei, amidstall these
garboiles and hurly-burlies abroad, the Church shall be helped with a little
help, as Dan. 11.34. that through weaker means, she may see Gods greater
strength. That contemptible brook Cedron (whereof read Job. 18.1. compassing
some part only of the City Jerusalem; or passing thorough the middle of it, as
some write) together with the rivorets Siloe and others that run into it, shall
be able, through God, to save her from the power and greatness of her enemies.
Confer Isa. 8.6. and this place shall be the better understood.

The holy place of the Tabernacles] This was the beauty and bulwark of
Jerusalem, viz. the Temple, the continued sincere service of God; this was the
Tower of the slock, and the strong hold of the Daughter of Gods people, Mic.
4.8. See Psa. 26.1, 2. And these Rivers of the Sanctuary, these waters of life,
drawn with joy out of the wells of Salvation; the precious Promises, made glad
the City of God, the Consciences of Believers; and caused them to triumph over
all troubles.

Verse. 5. God is in the midst of her] Hence the Church is called Jehovali
Shannonah, the Lord is there, Ezekiel. 48.35. there he has set him up a
Mercy-seat, a Throne of Grace, and paved his people a new and living way
thereunto with the Blood of his Son, so that they may come boldly, obtain
mercy, and find grace to help in time of need, Heb. 4.14.

She shall not be moved] Or, not greatly moved, Psalm. 62.2. in those great
commotions abroad the world, verse. 2, 3. This bush may burn, but shall not be
consumed; and that by the blessing of him that dwelt in the bush, Deuteronomy 33. Exo.
14.23 Begneth have-shugnah. Kimchi. (...)
built she is upon a rock, Mat. 16.16, and so is every particular Believer,
Mat. 7.25. And if at any time they be in distress,

God shall help her, and that right early] Heb. When the morning appears;
that is, in the nick of time, when help shall be most seasonable, and best
welcome. Mourning lasts but till morning, Psalm. 30.5. the Church is
invincible.

Verse. 6. The Heathen raged] Among themselves, and against the Church (Christ
mystical, as Psalm. 2.1, 2.) with great force and fury: Quia ab ascenfore suo
Damon^ perur gentur, as Bernard gives the reason, because the Devil rides
them, and spurreth them on.

The King doms were moved] to remove and root out the Church, but that will not
be; because in the thing wherein they deal proudly, God is above them. See
those three sweet similitudes, Zech. 12.2, 3, 6.

He uttered his voyce] Thunderstruck the enemies, and saved his people by a
Miracle of his mercy, Psalm. 18.6, 7.

The earth melted] Centra naturam suam, quia est arida, says Aben-Ezra;
against the nature thereof, for it is dry. By the earth some understand the
enemies, who had almost filled the whole Land with their multitudes.

Verse. 7. The Lord of Hosts is with us] Even the Lord who commands far other
Hosts and Armies than the enemy has any; and this they shall see by our
Spiritual security.

The God of Jacob is our refuge] Heb. Our high tower, such as our enemies
cannot come at. When he calls him the God of Jacob, he has respect to the
Promises, says Vatablus; Gods Power and Goodness are the Churches Jachin and
Boaz.

Ver. 8. Come, behold the Works of the Lord] Venite, videte. God looks that his
Works should be well observed, and especially when he has wrought any great
deliverance for his people. Of all things, he cannot abide to be forgotten.

What desolations he has made in the earth] How he has dunged his Vineyard
with the dead Carcasses of those wild Boars out of the Forest, that had
infested it. Those four mighty Monarchies had their times and their turns,
their rise and their ruin; but the Church remains for ever.

Verse. 9. He makes Wars to cease] As the Lord puts the Sword in
Commission, bathing it in Heaven; so he can quiet it, and command it up at his
pleasure. He did so when Sisera was slain, and when Sexnacherib. The Church
has her Halcyous.

He breaks the bow, etc.] No weapon formed against thee shall prosper, Isa.
54.17. The Spanish Armada was set forth with infinite labor and expense; but
soon dispersed and defeated.

He burns the Chariots] Inquibus instrumenta bellica vel victualia pro
militibus circumgestant, says Aben-Ezra, i. e. their carriages for ammunition,
and provisions.

Verse. 10. Be still, and know, etc.] q. d. As you must come and see, verse. 8.
so come and hear what the Lord says to those enemies of yours, Cessate, and
scitete, Be still, St, and know, Ex vestris saltem malis discite, learn by what
ye have felr, that there is no contending with omnipotency. I will be exalted,
asking you no leave, etc.

Verse. 11. The Lord of Hosts, etc.] See verse. 7.

PSALM. XLVII.
A Psalm for the Sons of Korah] Carmen triumphale, says Mollerus; a
Panegyrical Oration, says Beza, written by David, when top-full of most ardent
zeal, and sung by the Korites in that stately solemnity, whereat he brought at
length the Lords holy Ark into the City of David: which gallant History is
lively set forth, 2 Samuel 6. and 1 Chronicles. 15. And the use that David does here
make of it, viz. concerning Christ's Kingdom, and the benefits thereby,
concerns us as much, or rather more, than that ancient people. The Rabbis
with one consent say, that this Psalm is to be understood De diebus Christi, of
the days of the Messiah, who was prefigured by the Ark, and should be the joy
of all Nations.

Verse. 1. O clap your hands all ye people] As they used to do at their Kings
Coronation, 2 King. 11.12. show your joy for, and interest in Christ your King,
by manifesting your righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Other
joys are mixed, and dear-bought, but this is sincere and gratuitous, as the
Prophet Isaiah sets forth elegantly, chap. 9.3, 5, 6, 7.

Shout unto God, with the voice of triumph] Heb. Of shrilling. gods praises are
to be celebrated with all manner of cheerfulness; and we are to be vexed at the
vile dullness of our hearts, that are no more affected and enlarged hereunto;
seeing all causes of joy are found eminently in God, and he is so well worthy
to be praised, Psalm. 18.3. Jews and Gentiles are here jointly called upon,
joyfully to praise their Redeemer.

Verse. 2. For the Lord most high is tirrible] Amiable to his own, terrible to
his rebels. This Son, if not kissed, will be angry, Psalm. 2. This Lamb, for a
need, can show himself a Lion: as he is the Father of Mercies, so the God of
Recompenses, etc. and being most high he can easily overtop and subdue the
stoutest of his enemies.

He is a great King over all the earth] As having taken possession by his
wonderful Ascension, of the universal Kingdom given him by his Father, and
gathered himselfa Church out of all Mankind, which he wonderfully rules, and
defends against the rage of Earth, and of Hell.

Verse. 3. He shall subdue the people under us] This was typified in the
Government of the Israelites, then ascendent in David's days, but fulfilled when
Christ rode abroad on his white Horse, the Apostles, Conquering and to conquor,
Rev. 6. Quando Britannorum inaccessa Romany loca Christo patuerint, as
Tertullian has it. Christ subdued the Britans and others, whom the victorious
Romans could never come at. The Chaldee has it, he shall kill the people under
us, sc. with the sword of the Spirit, the Word; when the Law came, sin revived,
and I dyed, Rem. 7.9. The Hebrew is, He shall speak the people under us; that
is, he shall by the preaching of the Gospel, powerfully persuade Japhet to
dwell in the tents of Shem, Genesis 9.27. Tremellius renders it, Jun. ex
Aben-Ezra, and R. Judah.
Cogit in caulam populos, he gathers the people into the fold, viz. that
there may be one Sheepfold, and one Shepherd, as Joh. 10.16. Ephesians. 2.14.

And the Nations under our feet] Hence the Jews to this day dream (as did also
the Disciples, sowred with their leaven) of an earthly Kingdom, wherein the
Messiah at his coming shall subdue the Nations, and distribute their Provinces
and wealth among his Jews. But Christ's Kingdom is of another nature, and the
Nations are already subdued to the Church, which remains one and the same,
although the Jews be as branches broken off, and others set in their place,
Romans 11.24. Besides, by the Nations under the Jews feet is meant (say some)
that the Gentiles should be Scholars, and the Jews Schoolmasters, as it were,
unto them: for so fitting under the feet, or at the feet, signifies in
Scripture, Acts 22.3. Luke 10.39. 2 King. 2.5. The teacher was called Joshebh,
or Sitter; the Scholar Mithabbek, or one that lies along in the dust, in token
of his humble subjection. And in this sense Seneca some where says, that the
basest of people (meaning the Jews) gave Laws unto all the world.

Verse. 4. He shall choose our inheritance for us] Or, He has chosen, Of his
free grace, he espied out the Land of Canaan for his people Israel, flowing
with Milk; and Honey, and such as was the glory of all Lands, Ezekiel, 20.6. and
as much, yea much more has he done for the whole Israel of God, both of Jews
and Gentiles, by electing them to an inheritance immortal, undefiled, reserved
in Heaven for them, 1 Pet. 1.4.

The excellency (or high-glory) of Jacob whom he loved] i.e. All those high and
honorable Privileges wherein Jacob once, and now all the faithful may
wellglory and rejoice. See Romans 9.4.5. having as great both abundance and
assurance of Gods grace and goodness, as Jacob ever had.

Verse. 5. God is gone up with a shout] The Ark is here called God, as also Psa.
132.5. and the face of God, Ps. 105.4. because from the Ark, in the midst of
the Cherubims, God spoke to his people, and they by looking toward it had a
sure symbol of the Divine presence. The bringing of it up with pomp and
solemnity into Mount Zion, was a type of Christ's wonderful ascension into
Heaven, triumphing over all his and our enemies, Col. 2.15. Ephesians. 4.8. and
joyfully entertained by Saints and Angels in Heaven. The Jews, ever apt to work
themselves (as one says of them) into the foolsparadise of a sublime dotage)
understand this passage of the future reduction of the Ark into the Sanctuary,
where it was once: and for the which they most earnestly pray still, as
Buxtorf. writes.

With the sound of a trumpet] Concrepantibus tubis: and in like sort he shall
return; De Syuags Jud. c. 13
Acts 1.11. with 1 Ths. 4.16.

Verse. 6. Sing praises to God, sing praises] Do it with all alacrity, and
assiduity, being of that Martyrs mind who said, Should I do nothing else all
the days of my life, yea as long as the days of Heaven shall last, but kneel
upon my knees, and repeat over David's Psalms to the glory and praise of God,
yet should I fall infinitely short of what is my duty to do.

Verse. 7. For God is King of all the earth] q. d. Our King, said I? it is too
little; he is King of all the earth. A title vainly taken by some proud
Princes, as Sesostris King of Egypt, who would needs be called (...), Lord of
the whole world. So, a Decree went out from Augustus Casar, that all the World
should be taxed, Luke 2.1. The great Turk Amurath the third styled himself,
Turk, Hist. 91
God of the earth, Governor of the whole world, etc. but these were but
bubbles of words, as Saint Peter has it, God is the sole Monarch of the whole
Earth, (...).

Sing ye praises with understanding] Non bacchantium more, but prudently, and
with a well composed mind, says Vatablus, Psalmo Didascalico, says
Tremellim, with such a Psalm or Song, as whereby ye may rightly inform one
another concerning his Kingdom, and your own duty. Heb. Sing ye Maschil, that
is, Quotquot sapientes inrelligentes and petitiestis psallend
one of the Psalms that bear that title, as some sense it: or, every one of you
that has skill in Songs, as others.

Verse. 8. God reigns over the Heathen] This is his universal Kingdom, whereof
before, verse. 7. and yet never can too much be said of it.

God sits upon the throne of his holiness] He is in a special manner King of
his Church (as Ahasuerosh was of his Hester) called his throne, Exodus 87.16 (
because the hand upon the throne of the Lord, that is, Amalechs hand upon the
Church, as some interpret it) His throne of glory, Jer. 4.21. and here the
shrone of his holiness, because Christ (who is called God so many times in this
Psalm) loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and
cleanseir, and so present it to himself a glorious Church, Ephesians. 5.25, 26, 27.

Verse. 9. The Princes of the people are gathered together) Or, the voluntary of
the people: The great ones disdain not to meet with the meanest at the public
Assemblies, for performance of holy duties; but thither they fly one with
another, as the Doves do to their windows, Isa. 63.8. glorying in this, that
they are Christ's Vassals, as did Constantine, Valentinian, and Theodasius,
Socrates.
those three great Emperors, casting their Crowns at his feet, and willing to
come under the common yoke of his obedience, with the rest of the people of the
God of Abraham, the common sort of Christians.

For the Shields of the earth be long to God]. That is, those Princes and
Magistrates also, Hos. 4.18. Psalm. 89.18. belong to the covenant of election a
though not many mighty not many noble are called, 1 Cor. 1.26. and it was grown
to a Proverb, ^mnium bonorum Principum imagines in (...) annulo sc^lpi posse.
The Spanish Friar was wont to say there were but few Princes in Hell; and why?
because there were but few in all. If such shall show themselves shields to
their people to protect them from wrong; and not sharks rather to peel them,
and pillage them; God will own and honor such. Others thus; the shields of the
Earth belong to the Lord, that is, the Militia of the World is his; he has and
can quickly raise the Posse comitatus of all Countries.

He is greatly exalted] How should he be otherwise who has sogreat a command,
and uses it for the defense of his people? Especially if the Grandees of the
earth become Religious; and draw on others by their example, and liberality?
Magnates Magnetes.

PSALM. XLVIII.
A Psalm, a song for the sons of Korah] When and by whom compiled, we certainly
know not. If by David, probably it was upon occasion of the Philistines coming
up to seek him, but were sent away back with shame and loss, 2 Samuel 5.7, 9. If
upon the slaughter of Sennscheribs army by an Angel, Isaiah or some other
Prophet of those times (as there were many) might be the Penman. It seems to
be of the same time and occasion with Psalm. 76.

Verse. 1. Great is the Lord] Greater, Job 33.12. Greatest of all, Psalm. 95.3.
Greatness it self, Psalm. 345.3. A degree he is above the superlative.

And greatly to be praised] No mean praises can be meet for so great a Majesty.
It must be modus sine modo. Bern.


In the City of our God] i. e. Lib. 3. de usu part.
In the Church; for others will not, cannot do it to divine acceptance. Galen,
amazed at the wonderful frame of man's body, sang an hymn to the Maker thereof,
but yet he lived and dyed a Pagan.

Verse. 2. Pulcher surculo.
Beautiful for situation] A beautiful Nymph, so R. Solomon. Or, beautiful
for the branch that droppeth balsam, says Moller; that is, for the Ark there
seated. Or, for the tract and climat, as Josh. 12.23. situat on the Northside
of Jerusalem, as Isa. 14.13. in a cold, dry and clear air, as Job 37.22.
Sanantur illi, qui illic infirms conveniu^t, says Kimchi, they which come
thither weak, are made well.

The joy of the whole earth] Not only of the whole Land, because thither three
times a year the Tribes went up, the Tribes of the Lord unto the Testimony of
Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord, Psalm. 122.4. nor only of the
East, whereof Jerusalem was held and called the Queen, Vrbium totius Orient is
clarissima, says Pliny, see Lam. 1.1. but also of the whole earth; Sumen
totius orbis, as one calls it, and Rabshakeh himself (in that, more ingenuous
than Strato) confesses Judaa to be a Land of Corn and Wine, of bread and
Vineyards, Isa. 36.17. Hence it is called the excellency of Jacob, Psalm. 47.4.
the goodness of the Lord for Wheat and for Wine, and for Oil, and for the young
of the flock, and of the Herd; for all which men should come and sing in the
height of Zion Jer. 31.12. but especially for spiritual blessings, that their
souls might be as watered gardens, and they not sorrow any more at all, ib. but
come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads, Isa. 35.10. for
the grace of God that brings salvation to all men, therehence appearing, Tit.
2.11. Isa. 2.3, 4. If Plutarch could say of Rome in Numa's time, that the
Neighbor Villages sucking in the air of that City, breathed Righteousnesss;
how much better might the same be said of this City of the great King, where
God himself was resiant, and his sincere service was established, Psalm. 132.13?

Verse. 3. God is known in her Palaces for a refuge] As the City was an ornament
to the whole Country; so was God to the City, as being a common refuge to both;
and as having his holy Temple there, not a professed Sanctuary for impiety, as
Fl^^us ^pitefully styled it, but far better deserving than Nama's new Temple
in Rome did, to be called, (...), the Sacrary of Faith, and Peace, where the
true God was truly worshipped, and found to be a very present help in trouble,
the bent bulwark.

Verse. 4. For (...) the Kings were assembled] The Princes of the Philistines, 2 Samuel 5. Or, Sennacheribs Princes, which were all Kings, Isa. 10.8.
Oecolampadins upon Isa. 13.19. says, that there were twenty and two Kingdoms
in Ass^ria; these all came with combined forces to lay Jernsaiem desolate, but
could not effect it.

They passed by together] They could do this City (dear to God. and secured by
him, the Athenians boasted that they were (...), beloved of God, the
Hier^s^lymitans were surely so) no more harm, than as if they had been so many
wayfaring men that had passed by it, with their staves in their hands.

Verse. 5. They saw it, and so they marvelled] None of them could say as Casar,
Veni, vidi, vici, but the contrary; they no sooner saw this Heaven-guarded
City, but their hearts mis-gave them; and they were ready to say as that Duke
of Saxeny did, who intending to make war upon the Bishop of Magdeburg, and
understanding that he made no great preparation for defense of himself, and his
territories, but sought help from Heaven by fasting and prayer, Insaniat alius,
said he, God bless me from such a madness, as to meddle with a man who
confideth in God, and commits himself wholly to his protection.

They were troubled and hasted away] Heb. they fled with an basty or headlong
flight, being smitten with a sudden terror, such as was that of the
Egyptians, when their Charret wheels were taken off; of the Poilistines, when
for haste they left their Gods behind them, 2 Samuel 5. of the Syrians, 2 King.
7. when they left all and ran for their lives; of the Assyrians, when the Angel
had slain an hundred eighty five thousand in their camp, etc.

Verse. 6. Fear took hold upon them there] By So in the former verse, and There
in this, the shameful flight of these enemies is lively deciphered, and as it
were pointed at with the finger. So Psalm. 14.5. There were they in great fear;
for God is in the Generation of the Righteous.

And pain as of a Woman in Travel] Their grief was no less than their fear: and
it came upon them, Cert^, cito, subito, suddenly, sorely, irresistably,
inevitably.

Verse. 7. Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish] i. e. Of the Ocean, or of the
Mediterranean Sea, Isa. 2.16. and 23.1, 6, 10, 14. The meaning is, like as thou
O God with thine East Wind that Euroclydon especially, which Pliny calls
Navigantium Pestem (the Mariners mischief) art wont to dash and drown the
tallest ships at thy pleasure; so thou both can, and wilt deal by thy
Churches enemies: To whom therefore this Text should be as those knuckles of a
man's hand were to Belshazzer, to write them their destiny; or as Daniel was to
him, to read it unto them.

Verse. 8. As we have heard] viz. by the relation of our Forefathers, Psalm.
44.1. or rather by the promises contained in the Holy Scriptures, which now we
see verified and exemplified in our signal deliverances. Hierusalems constane
protection then is here affevered and assured, per comparationem promissionis
and experientie simul, and similiter eam contestantium. See the like, Job 42.5.
with the Note.

In the City of our God] The Church is the City of the living God, Heb. 12.22.
a City that breeds men yea Conquerours, as Herodotus says of Ecbatana the
Metropolis of the Medes, and as Pindarus of another place, (...), etc. Herod.
Clio^ Nemeis Od. ^


God will establish it for ever] There shall be a Church till the Worlds end,
maugre all her enemies.

Verse. 9 We have thought upon thy loving kindnesse] Heb. We have silently mused
or minded, as being amazed, or rather amated thereat, not able to speak for a
while, we were so transported when we met in thy Temple for the purpose to
praise thee, as for thy loving kindness toward us, so for thy power and
Justice exercised on our enemies.

Verse. 10. According to thy Name O God, so is thy praise] i. e. It is infinite
and inexpressible, Psalm. 148.1. Psalm. 145.3. Gods Name is exalted above all
blessing and praise, as those holy Levites acknowledge, Noh. 9.5. The distance
betwixt God and us is infinite; and we should labor to fill up that distance,
if possible, with our praises.

Thy right hand is full of righteousuess] i. e. of noble Acts, which thou have
done for us according to thy promise, Psalm. 25.10.

Verse. 11. Let. Mount-Zion rejoice, let the Daughters, etc.] Let the Church
Catholic, and each particular Member thereof give God the glory of his
Justice, and see that their joy be spiritual.

Verse. 12. Walk about Sion, and tell the Towers thereof] q.d. Are they not
still the same, and as many as they were before the approach of the enemy? is
any thing diminished or defaced by the late siege, or assault? Therefore thus
says the Lord concerning the King of Assyria, He shall not come into this
City, nor shoot an arrow there, etc. Isa. 37.33.

Verse. 13. Mark ye well her Bulwarks] Not at all impaired. The great Turk could
never have gotten the Rhodes, but by treachery, notwithstanding his long and
mighty batteries made upon that place day and night. How he raged at the last
assault of Scodra, and blasphemed, see Turk. hist. page four hundred twenty
three. Geneva, Hanc urbem non nisi miraculose stetisse and stare per multos
^^nos res ipsa clamst. Anton, Fayus.
is environed with enemies, French, Spanish, Savoy, Pope, and barred out from
all aid of neighbor Cities and Churches; yet is upheld, as it were, by an
immediate hand of Heaven, as Beza has set forth in an elegant Emblem.

Verse. 14. For this God is our God] To draw them up to this consideration it
was, that the Propher so calls upon people to view Sion, etc. and to take
notice that she might well have written upon her gates (as that City
Hippocrates writes of, had) Intacta manet, the Daughter of Sion is a Maid
still, through the prowess of her Champion.

Even unto death] And after too; for this is not to be taken exclusive, He will
never leave us, nor forsake us.

PSALM. XLIX.
Verse. 1. Hear this all ye people] This that is of so great consequence, and
universal concernment, viz. that the Saints should not be frighted nor
perplexed at the present prosperity of graceless persons; but consider that
death at utmost shall render them extremely miserable, and at the day of
Judgment men shall retutn and discern a manifest difference betwixt the
Righteous and the Wicked, betwixt him that serves God, and him that serves
him not, Mal. 3. ult.

Give ear all ye Inhabitants of the World] Hear and give ear, be not proud, for
the Lord has spoken it, Jer. 13.15. The Inhabitants of the World (Heb. of the
transitory World) are like men in a Mill, through hurry of business; or as one
that is running a race, to whom though never so good counsel be given, he
cannot stay to hear it. Of such we use to say, that they hear with their
harvest-ears (harvest it is a time of great pleasure, and of great business)
and hence it is that we have so ill a feed-time for the Word. We had need to
wish (as Harding once did) that we could cry out against sin as loud, as the
bells of Oseney; yea as those Catholic Preachers, whose voice is heard in all
speeches, and languages, Psalm. 19.3.

Verse. 2. Both low and high, rich and poor together] Heb. Both sons of Adam, or
earthy-man, and sons of Ish, or nobleman quorum
Exmeliore lute finxit pracordia Titan.


Diogenes once made a like outcry at Athens, (...), Hear Oyemen; and when a
company came about him expecting what he would say to them, he looked upon them
and said, (...), I called for men, and not for Varlets.

Verse. 3. My mouth shall speak and wisdome] Heb. Wisdoms and understandings;
and yet the matter of this Psalm was nothing extraordinary for the main of it;
so that a profane person would have come out with his Quid dignum tanto tulit
hic promissor hiatu?

But good points are not therefore to be ^^ighted, because commonly handled;
but therefore the better to be heeded, and proof to be made by practice, what
that good and holy and acceptable will of God is, that is so much pressed upon,
as Romans 12.2.

Verse. 4. I will incline mine ear to a parable] q. d. I desire you to do no
more than I will do my self. I (...), therefore have I spoken; I have wrought
my Doctrine upon mine own affections first, and shall dig it out of mine own
bosom for your benefit. It is a Parable I must tell you, or a Master-sentence,
yea it is a Mystery, a Riddle, as the other word here signifies.

I will open my dark sayings] The doctrine of Life Eternal, and the Judgment
to come, here more clearly deliy ered than any where else almost in the Old
Testament, is a mystery.

Verse. 5. Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil?] All the days of the
afflicted are evil, Prove. 15.15. But why should either ^, or any other
afflicted Servant of God be over-muchtroubled, as if some strange thing had
befaln us; or staggered at the better condition of worse men, all things
considered?

When the iniquity of my heels] Or, of my Supplanters, mine enemies, those
naughty men (called here iniquity in the abstract) who seek to trip up my
heels, and do surround me with their snares for that purpose. See Psalm. 56.7.
Or thus, When the iniquity of my heels, etc. That is, as some will have it,
when my sins come to my remembrance, or are chastened upon me. Every man's heel
has some iniquity. As we shall have some dirt cleaving to our heels whiles we
walk in a dirty world: so there is some defilement upon all our actions, which
we may call the iniquity of ourheels. He that is washed, says our Savior to
Peter, needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit, Joh. 13.10.
The comparison seems to be taken from those that wash in Bathes; for although
their whole bodies are thereby made clean, yet going forth they touch the earth
with their feet, and so are fain to wash again: semblably the Saints, though
bathed in that blessed Fountain opened for sin, and for uncleanness, Zech.
13.1. and thereby freed from the stain and reign of sin; yet their feet or
heels have some filth on them, some relics of corruption do still cleave to
them, and cause them some sorrow; yet ought they not to fear, or be dismayed,
but by the practice of mortification purge themselves daily from all filthiness
of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, 2 Cor. 7.1.

Verse. 6. They that trust in their wealth] which was never yet true to those
that trusted in it: And yet it is wondrous hard to have wealth, and not in some
measure to trust in it, that is, to think our selves simply the better, and the
safer for it, as our Savior shows, and this Disciples after some wonderment,
at length understood him; so Mark 10.23, 24. Hence that strict charge, 1 Timothy
6.17.

And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches] Contrary to Jer. 9.23.
This Psalm sets forth the better gloriation of a Believer in the grace of God,
and in his blessed condition, wherein he is lifted up above the greatest
Worldings.

Verse. 7. None of them can by any means redeem his brother] And therefore all
Money that has been given for Masses, Diriges, Trentals, etc. has been cast
away: seeing Christ is the only Redeemer, and in the other World Money bears
no Mastery, neither can a man buy off death, though he would give never so
much. Death will not regard any Ransom, neither will he rest content though
thou give many gifts, as Solomon says in another case, Prove. 6.35. Fie quoth
that great Cardinal Beanford, will not Death be hired? Act. and Mon. in H. 6.
Will Money do nothing? Wherefore should I dye, being so rich? If the whole
Realm would save my life, I am able either by policy to get it, or by riches to
buy it, etc. Lewis the Eleventh would not hear of death all the time of his
last Sickness, but when he saw there was no remedy, he sent for the Holy Water
from Rhemes, together with Aarons rod, as they called it, and other holy
Relics, Epit. Hist. Gall. Balth. Exner. Val. Max. Christ, p. 391.
thinking therewith to stop Deaths mouth, and to stave him off; but it would
not be. O Miser (says one thereupon) hoc assidue times quod semel faciendum
est.? Hoc times quod in tua mann est ne timeas? Pietatem assume, superstitionem
omit; mors tua vita erit, and quidem beata atque eterna.

Verse. 8. For the redemption of their soul is precious] i.e. the price of life
is greater than that any man, how wealthy soever, can compass it. Money is the
Monarch of this World, but not of the next.

And it cease for ever] i.e. The purchase of a longer life cease, there is
no such thing, believe it, Job 36.18, 19. Deuteronomy. 23.22. Zech. 11.12. To blame
then were the Agrigentines, who did eat, build, plant, etc. as though they
should live for ever.

Verse. 9. That be should still live for ever]. As every wicked man would, if it
might be had for money; for he knows no happiness but to Have, and to Hold; on
the the other side the Grave, he looks for no good; whereas a godly manholdeth
mortality a Mercy, as Phil. 1.23. he has, Mortem in desiderio and vitam in
patientin, as Fulgentius says, he desires to dye, and yet is content to live:
accepting of life, rather than affecting it, enduring it, rather than desiring
it.

And not see corruption] Heb. The pit of corruption. The Chaldee understands
it of Hell: to the which the wicked man's death is as a trap-door.

Verse. 10. For he sees that wise men dye, likewise the fool] This to be a
truth, etiam muta clamant cadavera, the dead Corpses of both do preach and
proclaim, by a dumb kind of eloquence. (...).
Death makes no difference: Pallida mors equo, etc. It is appointed for all
men once to dye. It lies as a man's Lot, as the word signifies, Heb. 9.27. and
all men can say, We are all mortal; but alas, we say it for most part, Magis
us^ quam sensu, more of custom than feeling; for we live as if our lives were
rivetted upon Eternity, and we should never come to a reckoning.

Heu vivunt homines tanquam mors nulla sequatur,
Ant velut infernus fabula vana foret.
And the brutish person perish] His life and his hopes ending together. But it
would be considered, (...).
that wise men dye as well as fools, good men dye as well as bad, yea good men
often before the bad, Isa. 57.1. Jeroboams best Son dyed before the rest, because
there was some good found in him.

And leave their wealth to others] Nec aliis solum, sed and alienis, to mere
strangers; this Solomon sets forth as a great vanity. It was therefore a good
speech of a holy man once to a great Lord, who had showed him his stately
House, and pleasant Gardens; You had need make sure of Heaven, or else when you
dye, you will be a very great loser.

Verse. 11. Their inward thought is, that their houses, etc.] Some join this
verse to the former, and read the words thus; Where as each of them sees that
wise men dye, likewise the fool, etc. yet their inward thought is, etc. they
have a secret fond conceit of their own immortality, they would fain believe
that they shall dwell here for ever. The Hebrew runs thus, Their inwards are
their houses for ever; as if their houses were got within them, as the
Pharisees goods were, Luke 11.14. (...). So here, Internum vel interiora; not
the thoughts only, but the very inmost of the thoughts of wicked Worldlings,
the most retired thoughts and recesses of their souls are about these earthly
things: these lie nearest to their hearts; as Queen Mary said when she dyed,
Open me, and you shall find Calice at my heart. It was a pitiful case, that a
rotten town lay where Christ should, and yet it is ordinary.

They call their Lands after their own names] So to make them famous and to
immortalize them at once. Thus Cain called his new-built City, Enoch, after the
name of his Son, whom he would thereby have to be called Lord Enoch of Enoch.
This is the ambition still of many, that take little care to know that their
names are written in Heaven; but strive to propagate them, as they are able,
upon Earth, Nimrod by his Tower, Absalom by his Pillar, Alexander by his
Alexandria, Adrian by his Adrianople, etc. But the name of the wicked shall
rot, Prove. 10.7. and those that depart from God shall be written in the earth,
Jer. 17.13, etc.

Verse. 12. Nevertheless man being in honor abides not] Howsoever he think to
eternalize himself, and be grown never so great, dye he must, whether Lord or
Losel; and dye like a beast, a carrion beast (unless he be the better man) but
only for his pillow and bolster. At one end of the Library at Dublin was a
Globe, at the other a Skeliton; to show, that though a man was Lord of all the
World, yet he must dye, his honor must be laid in the dust. The mortal Sithe
(says one) is master of the royal Scepter, and it moweth down the Lillies of
the Crown, as well as the Grass of the field. Perperam accommodatur bic
versiculus, says another: this verse is not well interpreted of the first man
Adam, to prove that he sinned the same day wherein he was Created, and lodged
not one night in Paradise.

He is like the beasts that perish] Fecoribus, morticiuis, says Junius, the
Beasts that dye of the Murren, and so become Carrion, and are good for nothing.

Verse. 13. This their way is their folly] This their fond conceit of an
immortality is an egregious folly, fully confuted by every days experience; for
the longest liver dieds at last, as did (beside the Antediluvian Patriarchs)
Jounnes de Temporibus, Armor-bearer to Charles the Great, who dyed Anno Dom.
Asteds Chronol. 475. Naucler. Purchase, Pil^^ p. 481.
1139 aged three hundred sixty one years. So the old man of Bengala in the
East Indies, who was three hundred thirty five years old when he came to the
Portugals, from whom for his miraculous age, he received a yearly stipend till
he dyed. He that lived in our days till one hundred and fifty years, or
thereabouts, yielded at length to Nature; and yet men dote and dream still of
an immortality. The first doom that ever was denounced was Death, Thou shall
surely dye; and the first doubt that ever was made was concerning Death, ye
shall not surely dye; ever since which time there is something of the spawn of
that old Serpent left in our natures, prompting us to doubt of that whereof
there is the greatest certainty; and although every man grants that he shall
dye, yet there is scarce any man that futureth not his death, and thinks that
he may live yet, and yet, and so long: this is folly in an high degree, and we
should be sensible of it, laboring to become neither fond of Life, nor afraid
of Death.

Yet their posterity approve their sayings, Selah] Heb. Delight in their mouth,
are as wise as their Ancestors, tread in their tract, take up their inward
thoughts, ver. 11. observe the same lying vanities, and so forsake their own
Mercies, Jon. 2.8. Selah, q.d. O wonderful, for, see the issue of their folly.

Verse. 14. Like sheep they are laid in the Grave] These fatlings of the World,
these brainless yonkers, that will not be warned by other men's harms, but walk
on in the same dark and dangerous ways, whatever comes of it, these chop into
the grave (as a man that walks in the Snow may do suddenly into a Marl-pit,
and there be smothered) or rather are there pent up, as Sheep are thrust up in
a stall, or stable, to be slaughtered there (and in Hell their souls) they lie
as Grapes in a Wine Press, pickled Herring in a Barrel, Stones in a
Lime-furnace, Tiles in a Brick-kiln, etc. Tanquam pecudes, like sheep, says
the Psalmist here; and Junius his Note is, Morticinas puta in cloacis,
exquiliis vel puticulis project as 3 like sheep, that dying of the Murrain, are
thereupon cast into Ditches, Jakes, Boggs.

Death shall feed on them] They shall be meat for Worms, yea they shall be
killed with death, Rev. 2.23. which is worse than all the rest: sin, as an
heavy gravestone, presses them to death, etc.

And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning] i.e. at the
Resurrection, when the Saints shall share with Christ in his Kingdom (when the
wicked shall be his footstool) and shall judge the World, yea the Angels.
Others, by morning understand suddenly, or seasonably, as Psalm. 46.5.

And their beauty shall consume in the Grave] All their pomp and bravery
wherein they came abroad whiles alive (as Agrippa, and Bernice came to the
Tribunal with a great deal of fancy, Acts 25.23.) and with which they affect
to be buried in state; Sic transit gloria mundi, 1 Cor. 7.31.

From their dwelling] Whence they are carried to the Grave, that dark house of
all living, Job 30.23. Some render the text thus, Infernus habitaculum ipsis,
Hell shall be their habitation. Tremellius thus, Et formam little consumat
infernus receptam exhabit aculo ejus, and Hell consume their shape (that is,
their bodies now reunited to their souls) received out of its House, that is,
out of the Grave.

Verse. 15. But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave] Heb. From
the hand of Hell, q.d. I am, and shall be in far better condition both in life,
at death, Spe bona Do^ab indoctis di^forunt, disis^ Chilo.
and after death, than any of the Worlds darlings: why then should I fear, as
verse. 51. why should I envy their seeming happiness, which will have so sad a
Catastrophe, as verse. 14? I shall have heaven, and that is more worth than all.

For he shall receive me; Selah] A notable Text indeed, and well worthy of a
Selah: a clear testimony for the immortality of the soul, and for a better life
after this, as is well observed. He sunt parabola, and hac sunt anigmasa, says
a good Interpreter. These are those Parables, and these are those dark sayings,
mentioned verse. 4. riddles to the wicked, but cordials to the faithful.

Verse. 16. Be not thou afraid] David was comforted, and so he would have others
to be: for as it was said of a certain Bishop of Lincoln, that he held nothing
his own but what he had bestowed upon others, Hoc babeo quodcunque dedi: so the
Saints think their comforts nothing so comfortable, unless others may share in
them, and fare the better by them.

When the glory of his house is increased] viz. By a numerous Offspring,
stately building, gay furniture, great rents and revenues; for as they say of
the metal they make glass of, it is nearest melting when it shines brightest;
so are the wicked nearest destruction when at greatest luster.

Verse. 17. For when he dies he shall carry nothing away] Nothing but a Shroud,
as that great Emperor caused to be proclaimed at his Funeral. He was a fool
that on his Deathbed clapped a piece of Gold into his mouth, and said, Some
wiser than some; I will take this with me. See Job 1.21. 1 Timothy 6.7. with the
Notes there.

His glory shall not descend after him] No, nor be able to breath one cold
blast up-on him, when he is burning in Hell. O that wicked rich men would think
of this, before the cold Grave hold their bodies, and hot Hell hold their souls.

Verse. 18. Though whilst be lived he blessed his soul] As that rich fool did,
Luke 12. and that King of France, who puffed up with the Marriage of his Sister
to the King of Spain, called himself by a new title, Tres-bureuse Roy, the
thrice happy King; but was soon after accidentally slain by the Captain of his
Guard running at Tilt with him, at the solemnizing of that same Marriage, in
the very beginning of his supposed happiness.

And men will praise thee when thou do well to thy self] Feathering thine
own Nest, and pampering thine own Carcass; thou shall be sure of Parasites,
and Trencher-flies, who will highly commend thee, though against their own
Consciences, Romans 1. ult. The world generally admireth the happiness of such as
live at full, and ask what should such a one ayl? The Irish ask what they meant
to dye?

Verse. 19. He shall go to the generation of his fathers] i.e. To the grave, or
albeit he come to the age of his Fathers, that is, live here very long,

They shall never see light] Either have any sound comfort at death, or any
part in Gods Kingdom.

Verse. 20. Man that is in honor and understands not] Versus amabeus. See
ver. 12. there is but little difference: Stultitians patiuntur opes. The more a
man has of worldly wealth, and the less of Spiritual, and heavenly
understanding therewith, the more bestial he is, and shall be more miserable.
Caligula called his Father-in-law Marcus Silanus, (...), a golden brute, Quid
cervo ingentia cornua, cum desit animus?

Vel mihi da clavem, vel mihi tell seram. PSALM. L.
A Psalm of Asaph] Who was both a Musick-master, 1 Chronicles. 25.2. and a
Psalm-composer, 2 Chronicles. 29.30. The most are of opinion, that this Psalm was
made by David, and committed to Asaph to be sung, after that Israel had been
afflicted with three years Famine, and three days Pestilence, and the Angel had
appeared to David, Jun.
and set out the place where the Temple should be built, 2 Samuel 21. and 24. 1 Chronicles. 21.18. and 22.4.

Verse. 1. R. Nahum ap. Nebien.
The mighty God, even the Lord] Heb. The God of gods, whether they be so
deputed, as Angels, Magistrates; or reputed only, as Heathen-deities, 1 Cor.
8.9. Jehovah, or Essentiator is Gods proper Name. Some say God is here thrice
named, to note the Trinity in Unity.

Has spoken] sc. By the mouth of his holy Prophets, which have been since the
world began; Henoch the seventh from Adam spoke much like, Jude 14. The
Rabbines say, that this Psalm is, De die judecii futuro, of the Day of
Judgment. Others, that it is the Lords judging of his Church, drawn according
to the model of the great and last Judgment, whereunto it serves as a
preparation, or a warning-peece.

And called the earth from the rising, etc.] The habitable part of Gods earth;
the sons of men, Prove. 8.31. with Mal. 1.11. These are all called to attest the
equity of Gods proceedings against an hypocritical Nation; Children that were
corrupters. For God has thus far instructed all men, that He is to be
honored of all, with all manner of observance, Romans 1.20. Let this be pressed
upon all sorts, said Zalencm the Locrian Lawgiver, in the preface to his Laws,
1. That there is a God. 2. That this God is to be duly worshipped.

Verse. 2. Out of Sion the perfection of beauty] Heb. The whole Perfection,
Perfectissim^ pulchritudini^ locus. Tre^
or the Universality of beauty; because there especially was Gods glory set
forth in his holy ordinances, and more clearly manifested than in all his
handiwork besides. See Psalm. 48.2.

God has shined] Like the Sun in his strength, sometimes for the comfort of
his people, as Psalm. 80.1. sometimes for the terror of evill-doers, as Psalm.
94.1. and here. But evermore God is terrible out of his holy places, Psalm.
68.35. and 89.7.

Verse. 3. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence] He does daily come
and sit upon the tribunal in his Church by the Ministry of his Servants, Mat.
18.17. who must reprove sinners with all authority, and show themselves sons of
thunder, that they may save some at least with fear, snatching them out of the
fire, Jude 23. as Peter, Act. 2.40. and Paul, 2 Cor. 5.11. but especially when,
to work upon the Proconsul Paulus Sergius, he set his eyes upon Elymas the
sorcerer, as if he would have looked thorough him: After which lightening,
followed that terrible thunder crack, O thou full of all subtlety, and all
mischief, thou child of the Devil, thou enemy of all Righteousness, will thou
not cease to pervert the straight ways of the Lord? Act. 13.9, 10.

A fire shall devour before him] As he gave his law in fire, so in fire shall
he require it.

And it shall be very tempestuous round about him] Not before him only, but
round about him; lest the Wicked should hope to escape by creeping behind him.
That was a terrible tempest, that befell Alexander the great, Curtius lib. 8.
ex Dioder.
and his army marching into the Country of Gabaza; when by reason of continual
thundering and lightening, with hailstones and light-bolts, the army was
dis-ranked and wandered any way; many durst not stir out of the place, etc.
Tremellius renders it wish-wise, but in a parenthesis, Les our Lord come, and
let him not be silent. The Saints know that they shall be safe, when others
shall smoke for it; because God is their God.

Verse. 4. He shall call to the Heavens from above, and to the earth] That
these dumbCreatures may be as so many speaking evidences against an unworthy
people, and witnesses of Gods righteous dealings against them. See Deuteronomy. 32.1.
Isa. 1.2. Mic. 6.2. The Chaldee thus paraphraseth, He will call the high Angels
from above; and the just of the earth from beneath.

Verse. 5. Gather my Saints together unto mee] This seems to be spoken to the
Angels, those active Instruments and executioners of Gods Judgments. By Saints
here, understand professors at large, all that live in the bosom of the Church
visible, and partake of the external privileges only; such as are in the
Vine, but bear no fruit, Joh. 15.2. have a name to live, but are dead, Rev. 3.
such as whose sanctity consists only in covenanting by sacrifice. Basil
says, that such are called Saints to aggravate their sins; as a man that has
an honorable title, but has done wickedly; and is therefore the rather to be
condemned. When one pleaded once with a Judge for his life, that he might not
be hanged, because he was a Gentleman; he told him that therefore he should
have the Gallows made higher for him.

Those that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice] But were never brought
by me into the bond of the Covenant; for then the rebels would have been
purged out from among them, as it is, Ezekiel. 20.37, 38.

Verse. 6. And the Heavens shall declare his Righteousnesse] Those Catholic
Preachers, whose voice goes out aloud to the end of the World, Psalm. 19.4. See
verse. 4.

For God is Judge himself] And front him is no appeal; every transgression and
disobedience, from him shall receive a just recompense of reward, Heb. 2.2.
even those corruptions that are most inward, and lie up in the heart of the
Country, as it were; those pollutions not of flesh only ( i.e. worldly lusts,
and gross evils) but of spirit also, 2 Cor. 7.1. more spiritual lusts, as
pride, presumption, formality, selfflattery, carnal confidence in external
legal worships, the sin principally taxed in this Jewish people here in the
next verses.

Verse. 7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak, etc.] What sweet and winning
language is here for a preface! Gods proceedings against sinners, whom he might
confound with his terrors, is with meekness and much mildness. Genesis 3.9.11.
and 4.9. Mat. 26.50. and 22.11. Be we herein followers of God as dear Children,
Josh. 7.19. Gal. 6.1. 2 Timothy 2.29.

O Israel, I will testify against thee] i.e. I will expostulate with thee, and
convince thee. This is a mercy which the Lord vouchsafed our first Parents when
they had finned; the Serpent he would not so much as examine, but doomed him
presently.

I am God] And should therefore have been better obeyed.

Even thy God] And therefore thou of all others should have had more care,
and not have despited me with seeming honors, by presenting me with outside
services.

Verse. 8. I will not reprove thee for thy Sacrifices] i.e. For thy neglect of
them, but for thy resting in them, sticking in the bark, bringing me the bare
shell without the kernel, not referring thy Sacrifices to the right end and
use; but satisfying thy self in the work done. This was afterward the sin of
the Pharisees, is still of the Papists, and of too many carnal Gospellers, who
think they have served God. for they have been at Church, done their devoir,
for they have said their prayers, etc. Yea many of the better sort amongst us
hold only a certain stint of daily duties, as Malt-horses their pace, or
Mill-horses their round (that move much, remove little) out of custom, or
form. Yea the best find it hard enough to be in duty in respect of performance,
and out of duty in respect of dependence; to do all Righteousness, and yet to
rest in none but Christ's.

Or thy burnt-offerings to have been continually before mee] Heb. Thy
burnt-offerings have been continually before me; so that I am sated with the
very sight of them, Isa. 1. there, God complained that all his senses were
wearied, and his soul vexed, by the abundance of their outward ceremonies, but
want of morrall service.

Verse. 9. I will take no Bullock out of thy house, etc.] q.d. Keep them to thy
self, I need them not; thou settestan high price upon them, and think to
ingratiate with me by them, I value them not, nay I loath them. Sordit in
conspectu Judicis quodfulget in comspectu operantis. That which is highly
esteemed amongst men, is abomination in the sight of God, Luke 16.15.
Displeasing service is double dishonor.

Verse. 10. For every Beast of the Forest is mine] God is the great Proprietary;
and all is his by primitive right. It is but of his own therefore that any man
gives him ought; as David freely acknowledges, 1 Chronicles. 29.14. and that great
Emperor, who dedicating his rich Communion Table to Jesus Christ, wrote upon it
(...). Justinian apud Ce^ren.
Thine own, and of thine own Lord present we unto thee, etc. And yet vain man
is aptto conceit that God is obliged unto him, when he offers unto God any
part of his goods.

And the Cattle upon a thousand Hills] Or, Upon the Hills of a thousand owners.

Verse. 11. I know all the fowls of the Mountaines] i.e. in numerato habeo,
says Vatablus, they are always before me ready at my service.

And the wild Beasts of the Field] R. Solomon interprets it Reptile, the
creeping things of the Field; others, copiam volucruns in vallibus, the
abundance of birds that are up and down the Fields and Valleys.

Verse. 12. If I were bungry, I would not tell thee] I would not employ thee to
cater or purvey for me. Homer. Lucian.
But it befalls not God to be hungry, as not only Heathens held, and therefore
said that their Jove was gone into Aethiopia to be feasted, etc. but some
carnal Jews also, who conceived that a fat Sacrifice was as acceptable to God
as a fat dinner was to themselves.

For the World i^ mine, and the fullness thereof] Quicquid avium v^litat,
quicquid piscium matat, quicquid feraruns discurrit, as Seneca has it; all is
the Lords, he made all, maintains all, and may therefore at his pleasure
make use of any; he needs not be beholden; but the truth is, he needs not
any such broken supports. See Psalm. 24.7.

Verse. 13. Will I eat the flesh of Bulls? etc.] q. d. Are you so thick-brained,
as to think so?

Vervecum in patria, crassoque sub asre nati? No; He that kills an Ox
(unless he kill his corruptions too) is as if be stew a man; he that
sacrifices a Lamb (unless he see his own guilt, and be carried out to the
immaculate Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the World) is as if he cut
off a dogs neek: He that offers an oblation (unless therewith he offer up
himself for a whole burnt Sacrifice, Romans 12.1.) is as if he offered Swines
blood; he that burns incense (unless he lift up holy hands in prayer without
wrath, and without doubting, 1 Timothy 2.8.) is as if he blessed an Idol, Isa.
66.3.

Verse. 14. Offer unto God thanksgiving] That pith of your peace offerings, that
Sacrifice more acceptable to God than an Ox that has horns and hoofs, Psalm.
69. 31. Oh cover Gods Altar with the calves of your lips, giving thanks to his
name, Heb. 13.15.

And pay thy vows unto the Most High] Say not God a thank only, but do him
thanks; the life of thanksgiving is the good life of the thanksgiver. Our
praises should be real and substantial: Vow and perform to the Lord your God,
Psalm. 76.11.

Verse. 15. And call upon mee] These two, praising God for what we have, and
praying for what we want, do take up the whole duty of man; a holy trade is
hereby driven betwixt heaven and earth, and sweet intercourse maintained
betwixt God and man.

In the day of trouble] At anytime, but then especially; the time of affliction
being the time of supplication; for then we are fittest to call, and then God
is readiest to give answer, then we may have any thing, Zech. 13. ult.

I will deliver thee] It is but ask and have; and surely he is deservedly
miserable who will not make himself happy by asking. When there was a speech
among some holy men what was the best trade? One answered Beggary; D. Preston.
It is the hardest and richest trade. Common beggary is indeed the easiest and
poorest trade; but prayer he meant. It is like the Ring given a Nobleman in
this Land by Queen Elizabeth, with this promise, that if he sent that Ring to
her at any time when he was in distress, she would remember and deliver him.
He sent it, but it never came to her hands; but prayer never mis-carrieth, etc.

And thou shall glorify mee] Servati sumus, ut serviamus, Luke 1.74. And yet
it is ten to one that any returns with the Leper, to give God the glory of a
deliverance. Plerique ut necipiant impertuni, donec acceperint inquieti, De
Consid. 1.^
ubi acceperiut ingrati, says Bernard truly; Most men are importunate, that
they may receive good at Gods hands, restleffe till they have it, and are
careless to return thanks afterward. Out upon such an ingratitude, hateful
even amongst Hearhens.

Verse. 16. But unto the Wicked God saith] To the fair professor, but foul
sinner, to the Hypocrites in Sion, Isa. 33.14. to the sacrificing Sodomites,
Isa. 1.10.11. (...)
those that take upon them to be Teachers of others, especially, Romans 2.20.21.
Origin, after his soul fall, opening the book and lighting upon this Text,
Kimchi.
was not able to preach, but brake out into abundance of tears.

What have thou to do to declare my statutes?] Since they are holy, and ought to
be handled by such as are holy, Isa. 52.11. else they are dishonored, 1 (...)
2.17. Ore loqueri de illis, sed cord odisti. Sir. Interp.
Gods name blasphemed, Romans 2.23, 24. foul sinners hardened, Mat. 23.15. Quid
verba andiam cum fact a videam, say such? dicta fact is erubescum, says
Tertulian, their practice shameth their profession. And therefore to such we
may say as great Alexander did to one Alexander a soldier of his, but a
coward; Euber leav^ off thy name, or be a soldier; so may we say to such
profligate professors. Or as Archidamus the Lacedemon^an said to his Son,
rashly conflicting with the Athenians, Autviribus add, ant animis adime. So
here, Either add practice, or lay away Profession.

Or that thou should take my Covenant in thy mouth] boasting thy self to be
one of mine, and blurting out good words, when (...) If that State in story
would not hear a good motion from an ill mouth, much lesfe will God.

Verse. 17. Seeing thou hate instruction] Or, Discipline, thou will not be
brought to live strictly, to exercise godliness; thou refusest to be reformed,
harest to be healed. Melch. Adam in vit, Bucer.
Bucer and Melancthon framed a form of Reformation, with approbation of the
Peers and States; but the Clergy of Cullen rejected it with slander, and said,
that they would rather live under the great Turk, than under a Magistrate that
should seek to settle such a reformation.

And eastest my words behind thee] They are near in thy mouth, but far from thy
reins, Jer. 12.2. denying in thy life what thou profestest with thy lips:
Aethiopian-like, being white in the mouth only; or as Lillies, white but
unsavory. The Jews at this day show very great respect to the Law, which no
man may touch but with the right hand, and with a kiss of reverence: No man may
carry it behind him, Schichard.
but must lay it next to his heart in his travel, etc. They are enjoined to
take up any paper which they see lying on the ground: and the reason is, lest
happily the name of God be written in the paper, and ignorantly trodden under
foot. Christians, though free from such Superstitious curiosity, yet full of
religious care, should observe every tittle in Gods Word, lest they should
trample upon any. And when corruption boyleth (says a Reverend man) think the
Gospel of Christ professed by you lies prostrate before you: and will ye
trample upon that Gospel? will ye tread under foot the blood of the Covenant,
H^b. 10.29.
as if it were a profane thing?

Verse. 18. When thou saw a Thief, thenthou consentedst with him] Mala opera
hic memorata sunt in secret, faith Kimchi. These evils hereafter mentioned,
are secretly acted by those that pretended to better things. See Ephesians. 5.12.
and therefore Heaven and Earth are called to witness against them, verse. 4. See
Jer. 20.27. -- Servi ut taceant jumenta loquentur, the very Beasts have a
Verdict to pass upon secret sinners, as the Ass upon Balaam, and those Horses
upon Cardinal Angelot, who was so basely covetous, Pentin. lib. de Prin.
that by a private way he used to go into his own Stable, and steal the Oats
from them.

And have been partaker with the Adulterers] 1. In thy desire, supposing thy
self with them. 2. In thy filthy acts, though closely carried; as the Popish
Priests, whose rule is, Si noncaste, tam^n caut^.

Verse. 19. Thou give thy month to evil] Heb. Thou sendest, the Devil
borrows thy mouth, and thou letst him have it.

And thy tongue frames deceit] Heb. Joyneth, knitteth, compacteth.

Verse. 20. Thou sittest] In the seat of the scornful, on the Ale-bench, etc.

And speak against thy brother] Thy slanderous tongue, like a mad Dog,
biteth all it meets with; not thy near allies excepted: so inhuman are
Hypocrites.

Verse. 21. These things have thou done, and I kept silence] I suffered them,
seemed to wink at them, bearing with thine evil manners.

Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thy self] A good fellow,
an approver, an abetter of thy lewd pranks and practices. Cogitabat quod Ehieh
erat sicut tu, so Kimchi reads it. This is the evil use that wicked men make of
Gods patience, they transform him into an Idol after their own fancy, they have
base and bald conceits of him.

But I will reprove thee, and set them in an order before thee] Thou shall see
them once in their ugly hue, to thy conversion or confusion: Men's actions are
in print in Heaven, and unless they make their peace with the Judge in his
privy Chamber of Mercy, and so stop his open judicial proceedings in Court, he
will one day read them aloud in the ears of all the World. Meanwhile God
looks upon old sins, (which he seemed to wink at) as now presently committed
(for as there is no beginning of eternity, so no succession) and whatsoever he
has threatened, whatever arrows are in the Bow-string, will one day fly and
hit, and strike deep. Woe be to men, when God shall break up that filthy sink of
sin that is in them, surely they will then be as little able to bear the stench
thereof, as Judas was, who sought help of an Halter.

Verse. 22. Now consider this, ye that forget God] That cast him and his
Counsels behind your backs, before he awaken your drowsy Consciences, and
rouse up the Lion that lies sleeping in your bosoms, like Cains Dog, Genesis
4.7. with his Dogge-sleep: and before you come to answer for all, with flames
about your ears.

Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be name to deliver you] From the Woolf a
Shepherd may rescue his Lamb, not so from the hungry Lion, Ames 3. Isa. 31.4.
Gods power is irresistible, his punishments unavoy dable.

Verse. 13. Who so eff^reth praise glorifieth me] So his praise be cordial oral,
real, with Recognition of my benefits, Estimation, Retribution; this is the
best sacrifice he can bring me.

And to him that orders his conversation aright] That walks accurately and
exactly: walks as in a frame, treading, gingerly, stepping warily, not
lifting up one foot till he find sure footing for the other.

I will show the salvation of God] i. e. Give him a prospect of Heaven here,
and hereafter a full fruition of it.

PSALM. LI.
A Psalm of David] who was not ashamed to do open penance here in a white
Sheet, as it were: so did Theodosius the Emperor, at the reprehension of
Ambrose, after the flaughter at Thessalonica; he spent eight months says
Theadoret, in weeping and lamentation: he fell down on his face in the place of
the Penitents, and said, My soul is glued to the earth, etc Henry the Fourth
(then King of Navarre only, after wards of France also) having abused the
Daughter of a Gentlemanin Rochel, by whom he had a Son, was persuaded by
Mounsieur du-Plessis, to make a public acknowledgement of his fault in the
Church, Life of Phil. de Morn. by Mr. Cler^.
which also he did before all the Nobility of his Army. This counsel being
thought by some to be too rigorous, Du-Plessis made this answer, That as a man
could not be too courageous before men: so he could not be too humble in the
presence of God.

When Nathan the Prophet came unto him] Rousing him out of a long Lethargy,
into which Sin and Satan had cast him. See here the necessity of a faithful
Ministry, to be to us as the Pilot was to Jonas, as the Cock to Peier, etc. as
also of a friendly admonitour, such as David had prayed for, Psalm. 141.5. and
here he is answered. David had lain long in sin without repentance to any
purpose; some remorse he had felt, Psalm. 32.3. but it amounted not to a godly
sorrow, till Nathan came; and in private, dealing plainly with him, more
prevailed than all the Lectures of the Law, or other means had done, all that
while.

After he had gone in to Bathsheba] This was the Devils Nest-egge that caused
many sins to be laid, one to, and upon another. See the wosul chain of David's
lust, 2 Samuel 11. and 12. and beware.

Verse. 1. Have mercy upon me, O God] It Was wont to be, O my God, but David had
now sinned away his assurance, wiped off his comfortables: he dares not plead
propriety in God, nor relation to him, as having forfeited both. At another
time, when he had greatly offended God, by numbering the people. God counted him
but plain David, Go, and say to David, 2 Samuel 24.12. whereas before, when he
purposed to build God a Temple, then it was, Go tell my servant David, 2 Samuel
7.5. Sin does much impair and weaken our assurance of Gods favor; like as a
drop of water falling on a burning Candle, dimmeth the light thereof. The
course that David takes for recovery of this last evil, is confession of sin,
and hearty prayer for pardoning and purging grace. In the Courts of men, it is
safest (says Quintilian) to plead Non feci, Not guilty; not so here, but Ego
feci, miserere miserrimi peccatoris, misericors Deus. Guilty Lord, have mercy,
etc.

Permiser^ra m^i to^^itur ira Dei. According to the multitude of thy tender
mercies] They are a multitude of them and David needs them all, for the
pardon of his many and mighty sins; tha where (...) had abounded grace might
super abound, it may have a super-pleonas^^^, ^ 1 Timothy 1.14.

Blo^ out my transgressions] Out of thy Deb^-book: cross out the black lines of
my sins with the red lines of Christ's blood; cancel the Bond, though written in
black and bloody Characters.

Verse. 2. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity] Heb. Multiply, wash me; so Isa.
55.7. God is said to multiply pardon, as much as we multiply sin. David
apprehended his sin so exceeding sinful, his stain so inveterate, so ingrained,
that it would hardly be ever gotten out, fill the cloth were almost rubbed to
p^eces; that God himself would have some what to do to do it. He had been in a
deep ditch, Prove. 23.27. and was pitifully moyled; He therefore begs hard to
be thoroughly rinsed, to be bathed in that blessed fountain of Christ's blood
that is opened for sins, and for uncleaneness, Zach. 13.1. to be cleansed not
only from outward defilements, but from his swinish nature: for though a Swine
be washed never so clean, if she retain her nature, she will be ready to wallow
in the next guzzle. The time of our being here is (...), as Nazianzen calls
it, i. e. our washing time, Wash thy heart, O Jerusalem, that thou may be
clean, Jer. 4.14. not by thinking to set off with God, and to make amends by
thy good deeds for thy bad; this is but lutum luto purgare, to wash off one
filth with another, but by the practice of Mortification, and by Faith, in
Christ's meritorious Passion: for he has washed us, from our sins in his own
blood, Revel. 1.5. Other blood defiles, but this purifieth from all pollutions
of flesh and spirit, 1 John 1.7.

And cleanse me from my sin] In like manner, as the Leper under the Law was
cleansed. Leprosy, Frenzy, Heresy, and Jealousy, are by men counted
uncurable: Sed omnipotenti medico nullus insanabil^s occurr it morbus, says I
sidore, to an Almighty Physician, no Disease is uncurable. There is indeed a
Natural Novatianis^^ in the timorous Consciences of convinced s^^ners, to doubt
and question pardon for sins of Apostasy, and failing after Repentance; but
there need be no such doubting, since God who has bidden us to forgive a
repenting Brother seventy times seven times in one day, will him self much
more. All sins and Blasphemies shall be forgiven to the sons of men, etc. Mat.
12.31.

Verse. 3. For I acknowledge my transgressions] And therefore look for pardon,
according to thy promise. Home agroscit, Deus ignoscit.

And my sin] My twisted sin, and sadly accented; mine accumulative sin,
voluminous wickedness, that has so many sins bound up in it, as Cicero says
of Paricide.

Is ever before me] To my great grief and regret, my Conscience twitteth me
with it, and the Devil lays it in my dish. This makes him follow God so
close, resolved to give him no rest till he has registered, and enrolled the
remission of his sins in the Book of Life, with the bloody lines of Christ's
soul-saving sufferings, and golden Characters of his own eternal love.

Verse. 4. Against thee, thee only have I sinned] This he spoke in respect of
the secrecy of his sins, say some: whence also it follows, And done this
evil m thy sight^ David sent for Bathsheba by his Servants, but they knew not
wherefore he sent for her, says Kimchi; neither knew any one why Letters were
sent to Joub to kill Uriah: but because he refused to obey the King, bidding
him go home to his honse, etc. Others thus, Against thee only, that is, thee
ma^^ly; for every sin is a violation of Gods Law, the trespass may be against
man, but the transgression is ever against God. Others again thus, Against
thee, etc. that is, Against thee so good a God have I thus hainou^^y offended,
giving thereby thine enemies occasion to blaspheme thee. This, I take it, is
the true meaning.

And done this evil in thy fight] Which was to despise thee, 2 Samuel 12.10. not
caring though thou lookedst on.

That thou might est be justified when thou speak^st, etc.] i.e. declared to be
just, whatever thou have denounced against me, or shall inflict upon me. The
unrighteousness of man commends the righteousness of God, Romans 3.4, 5. To
thee, O Lord God, belongs righteousness, but unto us confusion of face, says
Daniel chap. 9.

Verse. 5. Behold I was shapen in iniquity] This he alleges, viz. his original
pravity, not as an excuse, but as an aggravation of his actual abominations,
which he says were committed out of the vile viciousness of his nature. See
Psalm. 58 3, 4. The Masorites here observe, that the word rendered iniquity is
full, written with a double Vau; to signify the fullness of his sin; whole evil
being in every man by nature, and whole evil in man; which when the Saints
confess, they are full in the mouth, as I may so say, they begin with the root
of sin (not at the fingers ends as Adenibezek did) stabbing the old man at the
heart first, and laying the main weight upon original corruption, that
in-dwelling sin, as the Apostle calls it, Romans 7.14. that sin of evil
concupiscence, as the Chaldee here: that peccatum peccans, as the Schools.
Tully belike had heard somewhat of this, when he said, Cum primum nascimur, in
omni continuo pravitate versamur, As Soon as ever we are born, we are forthwith
in all wickedness. Augustine says, Damnatus homo antequam natus, Man is
condemned as soon as conceived.

And in sin did my mother conceive me] Heb. Warm me; This Aben-Ezra
interprets to be our great Grandmother Eve, Qua non parturiebat antequam
peccabat. David meant it doubtless of his immediate mother, and spoke of that
poison wherewith she had warmed him in her womb, before the soul was infused.
Corruption is conveyed by the impurity of the seed, Job 14.4. Job. 3.6. and 31.
Sin may be said to be in the seed incoative and dispositive, as fire is in the
Flint. Let us therefore go with Elisha to the Fountain, and cast salt into
those rotten and stinking waters. And for our Children, let us labor to mend
that by education which we have marred by propagation.

Verse. 6. Behold, thou desire truth in the inward parts] Quam tamen mihi
defuisse res ipsa demonstrat; but this truth has not been found in me, when I
acted my sin in that sort, and did mine utmost to hide it from the world. I
have showed little truth in the inward parts, but have grossly dissembled in my
dealings, with Vriab especially, whom I so plied at first with counterfeit
kindness, and then basely betrayed him to the sword of the enemy. Sinisterity
is fully opposite to sincerity, trcachery to truth.

And in the hidden parts thou shall make me to know wisdom] Thus, by faith,
says one, he rises out of his sin, being taught wisdom of God. Others read
it, Thou have made me to know, etc. And yet have I sinned against the light of
mine own knowledge and Conscience; although thou have taught me wisdom
privately, E^ eheu quam familiariter, as one of thine own Domestics, or
Disciples. Some make it a prayer, Cause me to knew wisdom, etc.

Verse. 7. Purge me with Hysop and I shall be clean] Sprinkle me with the blood
of Christ by the Hyssop-bunch of faith, not only taking away thereby the sting
and stink of sin, but conferring upon me the sweet savor of Christ's
righteousness imputed unto me. See Heb. 9.13, 14, 19. where he calls it
Hyssop; of which see Dioscorides, lib. 3. chap. 26.28. David multiplieth his
suit for pardon, not only in plain terms, but by many metaphors.

Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow] So we cannot be by any washings of
our own, though with Snow-water, Isa. 6.46. The Brides Garments are made white
in the Lambs blood, Rev. 1.14. the foulest sinners washed in this Fountain
become white as the snow in Salmon, Isa. 1.18. 1 Cor. 6.11. Ephesians. 5.27. Peccata
non redeunt.

Verse. 8. Make me hear joy and gladness] God will speak peace unto his people,
he creates the fruit of the lips to be peace, Isa. 57.19. etc. No such joyful
tidings to a condemned person as that of a Pardon. Be of good cheer, thy sins
are forgiven thee. Feri, feri Domine, nam a peccatis absolutus sum, said
Luther. David's Adultery and Murder had weakened his Spiritual condition, and
wiped off all his comfortables: but now he begs to be restored by some good
Sermon, or sweet promise set home to his poor soul.

That the bones which thou have broken may rejoyce] By leaping over Gods pale
he had broke his bones; and fain he would be set right again, by a renewed
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, by his former feelings of
Gods favor.

Verse. 4. Hide thy face from my sins] We are not able to endure Gods presence,
much less his Justice for our sins; nor can there be any sound peace of
Conscience whiles he frowneth. His favor is better than life, but his
displeasure more bitter than death it self. See 2 Samuel 14.32.

And blot out all mine iniquities] See how one sin calls to mind many
thousands; which though they lie a sleep a long time, like a sleeping debt, yet
we know not how soon they may be reckoned for. Make sure of a general pardon;
and take heed of adding new sins to the old.

Verse. 10. Create in me a clean heart, O God] His heart was woefully soiled
with the filth of sin, and the work of grace interrupted; he therefore prays
God to interpose and begin it again, to set him up once more, to re-inkindle
those sparks of the spirit that lay almost quite smothered; to put forth his
almighty power for that purpose, to farm that- Augean stable of his heart; to
sanctify him throughout in spirit, soul, and body; and to keep him blameless
unto the coming of his son, 1 These. 5.23.

Andrenew a right spirit within mee] Or, a firm spirit, firm for God, able to
resist the Devil, steadfast in the faith, and to abide constant in the way that
is called holy.

Verse. 11. Cast me not away from thy presence] Deprive me not of communion
with thee, and comfort from thee; for that is a piece of Hell torments, 2 These.
1.9. Cains punishment, which possibly David might here mind, as being guilty of
murder. And Saul's loss of the Kingly Spirit, 1 Samuel 15.15. might make him
pray on

And take not thine holy Spirit from mee] David knew that he had done enough to
make the holy Spirit loath his lodging; he might also think that the Spirit had
urterly withdrawn himself, and others might think as much, beholding his
Crosses, Jer. 30.17. But the gifts and callings of God are without repentance;
and where the Spirit once inhabiteth, there he abides for ever, Joh. 14.16. an
interruption there may be of his work, but not an intercision; and a Saint
falling into a gross sin may lose his jus aptitudinale ad calum, but not his
jus heredit arium; his fitness, but not his right to Heaven, that holy place.

Verse. 12. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation] He had grieved that holy
thing, that Spirit of God whereby he was sealed to the day of redemption,
Ephesians. 4.30. and is therefore at a loss for comfort; he had vilipended that
patent of his pardon which God had passed under his hand and seal: God
therefore calls for it home again into the pardon-office, as it were; that he
may know the worth by the want. A man may sin away, not only the sense and
comfort of his pardon, but the evidence and knowledge of it, as that place of
Peter seems to imply, 2 Pet. 1.9. Mountebanks, who wound their flesh to try
conclusions upon their own bodies how sovereign the salve is, D. Sibbes Souls
confl.
do often feel the smart of their presumption, by long and desperate wounds: So
God will let his David's see what it is to make wounds in their consciences, to
try the preciousnesse of his balsam; such may go mourning to their graves. And
though with much ado they get assurance of pardon, yet their consciences will
be still trembling, till God at length speak further peace; even as the waters
of the Sea after a storm are not presently still, but move and tremble a good
while after the storm is over.

And upholdest more with thy free Spirit] Heb. firmly sustain me with thy noble
or Princely Spirit, that may make me steady and ready to come off roundly in
thy service. Sin against conscience disableth for duty, takes away freedom to
it, and stability in it. David therefore prays God to fix his quicksilver, to
balance his lightness, to settle and fill that vain and empty heart of his,
with something that may stay and stablish it, that may also free and enlarge it
(for where the Spirit of God is, there is liberty, 2 Cor. 3.17.) that he might
yield prompt and present obedience to God in all things; and with all might be
apt and able to teach transgressors, as he promises to do in the next words.

Verse. 13. Then will I teach transgressors thy wayes] Instruunts nos Patres tum
docentes, tum labentes, says Augustine, Two ways the Saints teach us. First,
By their Doctrine. Secondly, By their Falls and Failings. David had taught men
this last way to his cost, that it is triste mortalitatis privilegium licere
aliquando peccare; Now he promises by his example and instruction to teach
transgressors, those that are in the very bonds and hands of the Devil, Gods
ways of mercy to the penitent; and that they must either turn to God, or burn
for even in Hell.

And sinners shall be converted unto thee] They shall give not the half, but
the whole turn; and it shall appear by them. The turning of a sinner from evil
to good, is like the turning of a Bell from one side to another; you cannot
turn it, but it will make a sound, and report its own motion.

Verse. 14. Deliver me from blood-guiltinesse O God] Heb. From bloods; in every
drop whereof is a tongue crying for vengeance. Besides, if David's adultery was
a sin of infirmity (he was preocoupated, as Gal. 6.1.) yet his murdering of
Uriah, and many others that fell together with him, was a sin of presumption; a
deliberate prepensed evil, done in cold blood, and therefore lay very heavy
upon his conscience. Howbeit he gat pardon of this great sin also; so that it
never troubled him on his deathbed, as some other did, though not so great,
where of he had not so thoroughly repented, 1 King. 2.

Thou God of my salvation] By making choice of this so fit an Attribute, he
flirreth up himself to take better hold.

And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy Righteousness] That is, of thy
faithfulness in performing thy promise of pardon to the penitent. As Aarons
golden bells sounded, so should our tongues sound Gods praises, and sing them
aloud, shrill them out.

Verse. 15. O Lord open thou my lips] Which now I find stopped and sealed up, as
it were, with the sin that does so easily beset me; so that whereas I promised
before to sing aloud of thy Righteousness; this I shall never be able to do
without thy special furtherance, nisi verba suppedites and tanquam pracas,
unless thou please to supply me both with affections and expressions, as well
as with matter of praise.

And my mouth shall show forth thy praise] David had not been dumb till now,
all the while he lay in his sin, but all he did was but lip-labor, and
therefore lost-labour. Daniel confesses the like of himself and his people,
chap. 9.13. All this evil is come upon us; yet made we not our prayer before
the Lord ^ur God; that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy
truth. Prayed they had, but because they turned not frons their iniquities,
they got nothing by their prayers or praises. God is a Fountain, and if he meet
with a fit pipe (as is an ordinance rightly performed) there he usually
conveyeth his grace; but if he meet with a foul pipe and obstructed, there he
does not confer a blessing. The Pharisees were not a button the better for
all their long prayers, because rotten ar heart.

Verse. 16. For thou desi^^st not sacrifice] This is the reason why David
restipulateth Praise, if God will pardon his great sin, verse. 14. viz. because
he well understood that God preferred praise before all sacrifices whatsoever;
provided that i^ came from a broken spirit, Verse. 17. rightly humbled for sin,
and thankfully accepting of pardon. See Psalm. 50.14, 15, 23.

Thou delightest not in burnt-offering] viz. Comparatively; and indeed not at
all without a contrite heart.

Una Deiest, purum, gratissinsa victima, pectus. Nazianz.
Much less then does God respect the sacrifice of the Mass, that has no
footing or warrant in the word. A certain Sorbonist finding it written at the
end of St. Paul's Epistles Missa est, etc. bragged he had found the Mass in his
Bible. Bee-hive cap. 3^ fol. 93, 94. Buxtorf.
And another reading Joh. 1.44. Invenimus Messiam, made the same conclusion.
Some of them, as Bellarmine for one, would fain ground it upon Mal. 1.11.
Others fetch the name Missa from the Hebrew Mass for tribute; which comes from
Masas to melt (because it many times melts away men's estates) Rect e quidem,
says Rivet; per Missam scilicet pietas omnis liquefacta est and dissoluta.

Verse. 17. The sacrifices of God area broken spirit] i.e. Such an heart as
lies low, and hears all that God says; such a sacrifice or service as is
laid on the low altar of a contrite heart, which sanctifies the Sacrifice; Mr.
Abbas.
such a person as with a self-condemning, self-crucifying, and sin-mortifying
heart, humbly, and yet beleevingly makes out for mercy and pardon in the blood
of Christ, this, this is the man that God expects, accepts, and makes great
account of.

A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou will not despise] This is great
comfort to those that droop under sense of sin, and fear of wrath, being at
next door to despair. Bring but a broken heart and God will receive you
graciously, pouring the oil of his grace into your broken Vessels. This
comforted Bernard on his death bed, he dyed with this sentence in his mouth.
Je. Manl. loc. com. 73.
Austin caused it to be written on the wall over against his bed where he lay
sick and dyed. Many poor souls even in times of Popery had Heaven opened unto
them by meditating on this Psalm; and especially on this 17. verse.

Verse. 18. Do good in thy good pleasure unto Sion] Having made his own peace
with God, he now prays for the Church; and the rather, because by his foul
sins he had hazzarded, or rather exposed both Sion and Jerusalem, Church and
State, to divine displeasure. Delirantreges, plectuntur Achivi.

Build thou the walls of Jerusalem] i. e. Protect, defend and maintain the
civil State, grant all things necessary for its safety and well-being; supply
of all wants, confirmation and increase of all blessings. Thus pray we, Jer.
29.7. Psalm. 122.6, 7, 8. for except the Lord keep the City, etc. See Isa. 5.1,
2, 3. and 27.3. He is a wall of fire, Rev. 20.9. of water, Isa. 33.20, 21. say
therefore as Isa. 26.1. and beware of security, sensuality, senselessness, etc.

Verse. 19. Then shall thou be pleased with the sacrifices, etc.] i. e. Such as
are offered in faith, and according to the will of God, Psalm. 4.6.

Then shall they offer Bullocks upon thine Altar] They shall be free-hearted,
and frequent in thy work and service; va torpori nostro, Woe to our dullness
and backwardness in these happy days of peace and free profession, which we
had need improve as they did, Act. 9.31. Otherwise, we may desire to see one of
the days of the Son of man, and not see it, Luke 19.22, Go to Shiloh, etc.

PSALM. LII.
A Psalm of David] Of the same time and argument, likely with Psalm. 58.
Maschil] Or, to teach, that the end of the Wicked is evil; Redarguit pravos
mores, says the Syriack.

When Doeg the Edomite] When Abiathar escaping the slaughter-slave, the
bloodhound (as Edomite may signify) came and told David what was befaln the
Priests, and their City. This was no small affliction to David; the rather
because by telling the Priest a lie, himself had occasioned that Massacre.
Hereupon for the comfort of himself and other good people who were startled at
this sad accident, and might be deterred thereby from succouring David, he
penned this Psalm.

When Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, etc.] Doeg is a fit name for a
courtier; for it signifies a solicitous or busy-headed fellow, a catch-poll, a
progging-companion, an informer, one that listeneth after rumors, and carries
tales to curry favor. An Edomite he was by Nation; but a Proselyte in pretense
at least, and one that was at that time detained before the Lord, either by
virtue of some vow, or because it was the Sabbath Day, and he would not travel
on it, or to perform some other religious service, 1 Samuel 21.7. this dissembled
sanctity was double iniquity; and he became a type of Judas, as some make him.

He came and told Saul] Like a Parasite and a pick-thank, as he was; when as he
should rather have told Ahimelech, that David was out of Saul's favor, and
sought for to the slaughter, as Kimchi here notes on verse. 3. but he concealed
that, that he might accuse Ahimelech, and so slew three at once (says another
Rabbine) viz. himself, Saul and Ahimeleck, calumniatorem, calumniatum and
calumniam audientem.

And said, David is come to the house of Ahimeleck] Few words, but full of
poison; Verba Doegi erant pauci, sed multum nocua. Kimchi. Midrash Tillin.
leviter volant non leviser vulnerant. See the story more at large, 1 Samuel 22
9. etc. The Rabbines say (from Levit. 14. where the same word is used of the
Leprous house, that is here, verse. 5. of Doegs doom) that he was for this fact
smitten with leprosy; and afterward sent to Hell, which they gather from Psalm.
120.4.

Verse. 1. Why boastest thou thy self in mischief, thou mighty man] Or, Thou
Giart; for so he seemed to himself when he had slain tot inermes nec
repugnantes, so many naked men, not making any resistance, though they were the
Priests of Jehovah; and afterward had smitten the innocent inhabitants of the
City of Nob, together with the women, the infants and the Cattle; like another
Ajax flagellifer or Hercules furens, and now vaunted himself in that
mischievous prowess.

Egregiam vero^undem, etc. The Hebrew word for boasting here, signifies also
madness, when it is taken in the worse sense, as Jer. 46.9. See Prove. 2.14. and
to boast of his hearts desire is the note of an Atheist, Psalm. 10.3.

The goodness of God endures continually] Maugre thy spitefulness, R. Solomon.
Kabuenaki. Midrash Tillin.
God is good to Israel, to the pure in heart, and will be so. The Rabbis make
this the sense, If Ahimeleth had not releeved me, God would have stirred up
some other to have done it. Some others understand it thus, The goodness of God
toward thee a wicked wretch endures all the day. This should lead thee to
repentance. But thou after the hardness, etc. Romans 2.4.

Verse. 2. Thy tongue devises mischiefes] i.e. Cogitat, id est eructat.
venteth the mischievous devices of thy mind, being an inter preter and an
instrument fit for such a purpose. Such another Doeg was Nicholas saunders,
Priest, the Firebrand of Earl Desw^^^ds Rebellion in Ireland, Anno 1580. a
restless and wretched man, whose foul mouth was at length stopped with famine,
that had been ever open to stir up rebellions against the State; that had
uttered so many Blasphemies against God, and his holy Truth, and invented so
many loud and lewdlyes against men.

Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully] That instead of shaving the hair,
launcheth the flesh; or missing the beard, cutteth the throat, Exscindit carnem
cum crinibus. R. Solom.
Consutro aberrans jugulum petit: whence Dionysius the Tyrant would not trust
any Barber (no not his own Daughters) to shave him: but singed off his own hair
with hot coals. The slanderers Tongue, as sharp as a razor, or as the quills of
a Porcupine, flasheth, and gasheth the good names of others, and that many
ways, viz. both by denying, disguising, leslening, concealing, misconstruing
things of good report; and also by forging, increasing, aggravating, or
uncharitable spreading things of evil report: not for any love to the truth,
nor for respect to justice, nor yet for the bettering of the Hearer, or the
Delinquent; but only to prejudice the one, and to incense the other. This was
Doegs sin, and denominateth him a Liar, verse. 3. though he had spoke but the
truth.

Verse. 3. Thou love evil more than good] Indeed evil only, and not at all
good, whatever thou pretendest. Thy heart is naught, and thence it is that thy
tongue is so mischievons; as stinking breath comes from corrupt inwards.

And lying, rather than to speak righteousness] For thou have cunningly
insinuated, for thine own base ends, and against thine own Conscience, that
those innocent and faithful Priests were of the combination; and so have built
thy self upon their ruins, thou false Sycophant, artifex doti. Selah.

Verse. 4. Thou love all devouring words] Verba devoratoria, the Greek has
it, (...), that devour and swallow up, so as the Sea does things cast into it.
So elsewhere, their throat is an open sepulcher, which devoureth all bodies but
renders none without a Miracle. Some render it, Verba voraginis, the words of
a Whirlpool, which first turns men round, and then lucks them in. Others, Verba
absorptionis, in reference to that use of the tongue, which is to sup up
dish-meats; Sic lingua attrahit homines it^ ut absorbeautur, says Vatablus.
The vulgar has it, Verba precipitationis, words that hurl one down headlong,
Ex edites adium vel rupium, as Hilary has it, from the top of houses, or high
rocks.

O thou deceitful tongue] Because although it were for most part truth that he
spoke, yet he did it maliciously, and by dishmulation pasled over that which
might have made for Ahimelech, viz. that he releeved David in the simplicity of
his heart, as thinking him to be high in the Kings favor, and employed by him.
Egesippus says of Pilate, that he was Vir neguam, and parvi faciens mendacium,
a naughty man and one that made no bones of a Lie; such another was Doeg. D
excid. Jerus 1.2. c. 5.


Verse. 5. God shall likewise destroy thee] Here are quot verba tot tonitr^a, so
many words, so many thunderclaps. Judicium ipsum lethale describitur.
As thou have destroyed the Lords Priests, and then whole City, razing and
harasing it: so God will demonith and destroy thee utterly, as an house pulled
down to the ground, so that one stone is not left upon another, Lev. 14.45. So
shall God pull down Doeg from that high preferment, which he by Sycophancy has
got at Court.

He shall take thee away] As a coal of fire is taken with the Tongs, Psa. 30.4.
Exurette. Vatah.
that it do no further mischief: some render it, He shall burn thee; R. Gaon,
He shall ^^^rifie thee.

And pluck thee out of thy dwelling place] Or, shall sweep thee out of thy
tabernacle; R. Gaon interprets it, Both hamidrash, the Lords Tabernacle,
whereinto a Doeg may set his foot as far as a David, but God will pluck him
thence.

And root thee out of the land of the living] Everret and evertet ie cum tota
familia, He shall utterly ruinate thee and thine, leaving thee neither root nor
branch, chick nor child.

Selah] i.e. Veritas est, says Aben-Ezra; It is even so: think not that these
things are spoken only in terrorem, for a Scarebug, for they shall all be
surely fulfilled upon thee.

Verse. 6. The righteous also shall see and fear] With a reverential fear, from
which shall spring sincere service, Aliorum perditio tua sit cautio; let other
men's perdition be our caution; let us wash our feet in the blood of the wicked.
There is an elegancy in the original that cannot be englished

And shall laugh at him] With an holy laughter: not that of irrision, but of
exultation in God, for his righteous executions.

Verse. 7. Lo, this is the man] Or rather, now the Monster to be pointed at;
once so mighty, now so miserable; O quantum haec Niobe, etc. what a strange
change is here; etc? As the true Israelite is pointed out with a Behold for
imitation, Job. 1.47. so is this counterfeit Israelite for detestation.

That made not God his strength] But carried the matter as if he had been some
petty-god within himself.

But trusted in the abundance, etc.] Never true to those that trusted them.

And strengthened himself in his wickedness] Heb. In his woeful evil, in his
putting many poor Creatures to their Woe is me.

Verse. 8. But I am like a green Olive Tree, etc.] Thus, when Doeg blasted
David, David blesses himself. Let him flourish in the Court, I shall much more
in the House of God. My name shall be precious among the Saints, when he
stinketh above ground; he shall wither, when I shall be fresh, flourishing,
and fruitful.

I trust in the mercy of God] Not in riches, as Doeg: and this faith is the
root of my fruitfulness, cheerfulness, etc. Gul. Parisiensis reports of true
Crystal, that by touching only it reviveth the decayed virtue of other
precious stones: sure it is, that faith reviveth the virtue of other precious
graces.

Verse. 9. I will praise thee for ever, because thou have done it] Have
delivered me from Doeg, and others, Quod non perierim centies. Or, thou have
done execution upon Doeg: i.e. Thou will undoubtedly do it.

And I will wait on thy name] i. e. Depend upon thy Promises and Providence.

PSALM. LIII.
MAschil, a Psalm of David] Purposely set down here the second time, (see Psalm.
14.) to instruct what every man is by nature, and that he who is scholar to
his own carnal reason, is sure to have a fool to his master. The Heathens are
very obstinate in propugning man's nature, witness Cicero, and both the
Senecaes, saying, that if men would but follow the bent of their own natures,
they could not do amiss. And we have much ado to persuade people that their
Natures are so foul, their ways so wicked, etc. twice therefore is this Psalm
recorded, that all may be convinced, that there is no safety in such a
condition, nothing better than to hasten out of it.

Verse. 1, 2. The Fool, etc.] See the Notes on Psalm. 14.1, 2.

Verse. 3. Every one of them is gone back] Diogenes in a great assembly going
backward of purpose, and seeing every one laughing him to scorn, asked them
aloud, if they were not ashamed so to do? since he went backward but once, they
did so all the days of their life.

Verse. 4. Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?] Etiam scient in fine, and
dolebunt, says one, Know they shall to their sorrow in the end, that they have
eaten that on earth which they must digest in hell.

Verse. 5. There were they in great fear] Heb. They feared a fear. God they
feared not, of men they were greatly feared, and yet here they feared a fear
where no fear was, viz. without themselves; only facti sunt a cord suo
fugitivi, they feared and fled before their own consciences, their own
trembling heart, Deuteronomy. 28.65. the sound of fear that is in their ears, Job
15.21. the sound of a leaf chaseth them, Levit. 26.36. they flee when none
pursues, Prove. 28.1. Naturalists tell us of a certain little bird, quae fertur
metu ne in ipsam coelum ruat, imponere sibi semper dormienti alterum pedem,
which for fear lest the Sky should fall on her head, sleeps still with one
foot laid upon her head. The Gauls that dwelt near the Adriatic Sea, being
asked by Alexander the Great, what they most feared? answered, ne supra se
coelum corruat, lest the Sky should fall upon them. Galen writes of a certain
Melancholic fellow, who hearing that Atlas supported Heaven with his
shoulders, was therefore sore afraid lest he should faint under the burden;
and therefore carried his arm before him to save his head. Heraclides out of
Anacreon tells of one Artemon a timorous man, who kept home as much as might
be, having ever a couple of servants to hold a brazen buckler over his head,
lest any thing should fall upon him from above. And if he were at any time
necessitated to go abroad, he was carried in a horse-litter that touched the
ground almost; Piut. in Pericl^
and was thereupon called Periphoretus.

For thou have scattered the bones] i. e. The strength, the strong troops says
the Chaldee; they want decent burial, as Jer. 22. says the Syriack.

Thou have put them to shame] viz. The poor afflicted, Psalm. 14.5. because

God has despised them] i. e. Subjected them to the contempt of the wicked.

Verse. 6. O that the salvation] Heb. Salvations; Indicat plenam satutem, says
Kimchi.

PSALM. LIVE.
MAschil] Instructing us, says One, to draw near to God, as dangers draw
nearer to us,

When the Ziphims] Which signifies Flourishing; Erant autem Ziphaei ex stirpe
Caleb. 1. Chron. 2. ^^ and Nabal, sed degeneres,
they might have flourishing estates, but they had withered souls; else they
would never have sought twice over to have betrayed good David into the hand of
Saul, 1 Samuel 23. and 26.

Came and said to Saul] If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are
wicked, Prove. 29.12. See the Note there.

Does not David hide himself with us?] viz. In the wood and wilderness near
unto our City? But what if he did, should they therefore discover him, and so
pull the vengeance of God upon themselves and their City? George Eagles (alius
Trudgeover the World) hid himself in a corn-field, Act. and Mon.
was descryed by Ralph Lurdain for money, and burnt at Chelmsford; where
afterward the same Lurdain was hanged for stealing an horse; and confessed it was
just in God upon him, for bewraying that innocent man.

Verse. 1. Save me, O God, by thy name] i. e: By thy self, and especially by
thy goodness, whereby thou art nominatissimus in Ecclesia, well known in thy
Church, as a main piece of thy name, Exodus 34.6, 7.

Verse. 2. Hear my prayer, O God] He runs to God by most earnest prayer, for our
instance and instruction in like case; for we must prepare for the like
trialls, nec de cruce disputandum est. otiose and velut in umbra, etc.

Ver. 3. For strangers are risen up against mee] He means not foreiners,
Nothi and spurii.
but home-dwellers; Saul, Doeg, Ziphims, etc. strangers to Religion, reason,
common humanity, Jews outwardly, but not inwardly; Heathens upon the matter,
Psalm. 59.5. Rev. 11.2. Am. 9.7. The Pope showed himself no better in delivering
up for money Zemes the great Turks Brother, who fled to him for safeguard of his
life, wrongfully sought after.

Oppressors seek after my soul] i.e. My life at least; my soul also they would
destroy, if it lay in their power, as the Papists delivered up John Hus to the
Devil when they burnt him; and would not allow Hierom of Prague a Confessor,
though he requested it. So the Monster of Millain that made his enemy first
curse Christ in hope of life, and then stabbed him to death, saying, Now go
soul and body to the Devil. So he that for spite procuring a man to be
hanged, Bodio. derep.
and seeing him penitent, said, I am afraid the rogue will go to Heaven.

They have not set God before them This was the root of all their outrages,
they made no reckoning of God, pr^ut est judex and vindex mali, as he is a
severe Judge, and a sharp revenger of sin and wickedness.

Verse. 4. Behold, God is mine helper] And that mine enemies might have seen,
had they set God before them. The Dutch have a proverb, where God has a mind
to destroy a man, he first puts out his eyes.

The Lord is with them that uphold my soul] That favor my righteous cause and
wish my welfare, as does Jonathan, and the rest that fear God; who although
they be but few and feeble in comparison, yet they have God with them, and for
them, (non interfuit modo, sed etiam praefuit) and how many do you reckon him
for? as Antigonus once said. David was environed, and in great danger to be
surprised; but God rescued him by an invasion of the Philistines, 1 Samuel 23.27,
28. The Lord knows how to deliver his, 2 Pet. 2. R. Moses expounds it, God
is loco omnium, and super omnes, in stead of all, and above all.

Verse. 5. He shall reward evil unto mine enemies] Or, Mine observers, that
watch me a mischief. I shall escape out of trouble, and they shall come in my
stead, Prove. 11.8.

Cut them off in thy truth] i.e. According as thou have pronounced against such
as seek and suck innocent blood.

Verse. 6. I will freely sacrifise unto thee] Or, Liberally; not with an ill
will and pinchingly. The Arabic renders it, Laudabo te obediens. Praise is
the best sacrifice, and obedience is the best praise.

I will praise thy name, O Lord, for it is good] Thy name is good, and it is a
good thing to praise it; for thereby men do thee right, help thee to thine own,
secure to themselves former favors, and procure future.

Verse. 7. For he has delivered mee] i. e. He surely will: this is the language
of faith; this is the triumph of Trust.

And mine eye has seen my desire upon mine enemies] This was not an evil eye
of envy or private revenge; such as was that of him, who when he saw a pit full
of mansblood, cried out, O formo sum spectaculum! O brave sight! or that of
Antichrist who has often glutted his eyes with many such goodly bloody sights;
as when he caused the Massacre of Paris to be painted in his Palace, Thuan.
and had the Admirals head sent him for a present: But as admiring Gods justice
on his enemies, and love toward his people, he was well pleased with such a
providence, and beheld it with comfort. The Arabic renders it, Oculus meus
requievit. Tremellius, Mine eye beholds mine enemies; I dare now boldly look
them in the face, being strengthened with thy might, etc.

PSALM. LV.
A Psalm of David] Whether made upon occasion of his flight from Keilah, 1 Samuel
23. or from Absalom, 2 Samuel 15, and 16. Idemest argumentum, and idem usus hujus
Psalmi atque superioris, says Beza; this and the former Psalm are of the same
argument, and for the same use. It is most probable that this Psalm was written
when Absalom was up, and Hush^i related unto Zadock the troubled state of the
City, 2 Samuel 17.15. with which compare, verse. 9, 10, 11. of this Psalm. For
thereupon David, put into a great perturbation, as verse. 4, 5. wished for the
wings of a Dove, not the pinnions of a Dragon, that he might fly farro away.

Verse. 1. Give ear to my prayer, O God] David's danger was present, his prayer
therefore is pressing; being not the labor of his lips, but the travel of his
heart. The breath that comes from the lips is cold, not that which comes
from the lungs.

Hide not thy self] As men when they are not willing to be sued unto, will not
be seen.

Verse. 2. Attend unto me, and hear me^] Heb. Answer me, that is, grant me
deliverance from this death which threatens me. This is his sense, as
appears by the sequel; though at present be could not instance, but only
beggeth audience.

I (...) my compla^^] H^b. I tass^ this way and (...) I am so much troubled, ut
meipsum lamentando huc and illuc versare, and mire agitare cogar. Prae dolor
moveo me nunc huc nu^ illuc. Campe^sis.


And make a noise] Plango, and perstrepo; Of our Savior it is said, that being
in an agony, he prayed more earnestly; He bent, as it were, all his nerves, and
set up his note, Luke 22.44.

Verse. 3. Because of the voice of the enemy] He may very well intend Shimeies
bitter revilings, 2 Samuel 16.5. etc.

For they cast iniquity upon mee] They tumble it on me, as men do stones or
any thing else upon their besiedgers, to endammage them; so did these, sin,
shame, any thing, upon innocent David, to make him odious.

And in wrath they hate mee] Heb. They satanically hate me.

Verse. 4. My heart is sore pained within mee] No otherwise than a woman is
pained in travel; cordicitus doleo.

And the terrors of death are fallen upon mee] Caused doubtless by the deep
sense and conscience of his late grievous sins.

Verse. 5. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon mee] Fearfulness of heart,
and trembling of body; which last falls out, Timor cord^ tremor corpris.
when as the Spirits flying back to the heart, to relieve it, leave the outward
parts destitute.

And horror has overwhelmed mee] This was David's infirmity; for he should
have better fortified his heart against that cowardly passion of fear: the
Devil also had a finger in it. At another time David could better resolve and
say, What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

Verse. 6. And I said, O that I had wings like a Dove] Ut citissime and
longissime fugerem, that I might swiftly fly far off from Absoloms pursuers; as
the Dove saves her self by flight, and not by fight, scoureth away to the
Rocks and deserts, Jer. 48.28. Many fouls are swifter of flight than Doves; but
these hold out better. R. Jonah says, that whereas other birds when they are
wearied with flying, do rest them upon rocks or trees, and are taken; the Dove
does not so, but lets down one wing, and flies with the other, and thereby
escapes the pursuer. R. Jonah ap^ Kimchi.


For then would I flee away] But whither, he says not, because he knew not.
The Church in the Revelation fled into the wilderness, Rev. 12. God provided a
Pella for those primitive Christians. Luther being asked where he would be at
quiet from his enemies? answered, Sub caelo, some where God would secure him.

Verse. 7. Lo then would I wander far off] Far from the force and fury of
these breathing Devils. Jeremy wishes the like; as being tired out by the
ungodly practices of his countrymen, chap. 9.2. And many a dear Child of God
forced to be in bad company cries, O that I had the wings etc. Or if that O
will not set him at liberty, he takes up that Woe, to express his misery. Woe
is me that I sojourn in Meshech, etc.

And remain in the Wildernesse] Among wild beasts; which were better than to
abide with these Lycanthropi, men more cruel, savage, and bloody than any
beasts.

Verse. 8. I would hasten my escape from the windy storm, etc.] I would thrust
my ship into any creek in the whole World, go as far as my legs, nay wings
could carry me. Of the swiftness of the Doves flight, see Plin. l. 10. c. 37.
and how David hastened his flight from Absalom, see 2 Samuel 15.14.

Verse. 9. Destroy O Lord, and divide their tongues] Heb. Swallow them up, O
Lord, and divide their tongues; by an allusion, as some conceive, to those two
famous Judgments of God upon Dathan and Abiram, first, Numb. 16. and then,
secondly, upon the Babel-builders, Genesis 11. both which were thrown out for
examples, to all succeeding ages, (as St. Jude says of the Sodomites, Jud. 7.)
and are to be considered of by the Saints, as here in their prayers against
their enemies. How God answered this prayer of David, see 2 Samuel 17.1. etc.

For I have seen violence and strife in the City] i. e. In Jerusalem, something
I have seen, but more outrages I have heard of, since Absalom with his army
came into it. The rude soldiers plunder the poor Citizens at pleasure; and
cannot agree among themselves in dividing the spoil.

Verse. 10. Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof] The ruffianly
soldiers do, as in garrisons is usual: Or Violence and Strife do; so that in
no place are good men in safety, from rapines and robberies.

Mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it] What work may be thought make
the common soldiers, among the women especially, when Absalom openly defiles
his Fathers concubines in the sight of all Israel, 2 Samuel 16.22? when Tilly
took Magdeburg in the late German wars, besides many other outrages, the
Ladies, Gentlewomen, and others, like beasts and dogs they yoked and coupled
together, leading them into the woods to ravish them. Such as resisted they
stripped naked, whipped them, cropped their ears, and so sent them home again.

Verse. 11. Wickedness is in the midst thereof] As if it were no longer as once
Theopolis, but Poneropolis, for all kind of naughtiness there.

Deceit and guile depart not from her streets] The Vulgar has it, Vsura and
dolus, Usury and guile; and Theodorets note here is, Not andum est, non modo
Novi Testamenti perfectionem, sed Legis statum faenus damnare, that Usury is
condemned in both old and new Testament.

Verse. 12. (...)
For it was not mine enemy that reproached mee] Achitophels perfidy and villainy
troubled David more than all the rest; there not being any wound worse, as
Sophocles says, than the treachery of a friend; he being such a kind of enemy,
quem neque fugere, neque fugare possumus, as Bernard has it; whom we cannot
easily prevent. See Psalm. 41.9.

Then I could have born it] Though as a burden; but nothing so grievous; I
should not have much mattered it.

Verse. 13. But it was thou a man, mine equall] Heb. According to my rank, my
compeer, my colleague, mine Alter-ego, my bosome-friend, one that stood even
with me, and upon the same ground as it were.

My guide] In all mine affairs and actions; so that I thought nothing well
done, that I did not by his advice and counsel, my Duke, my Doctor, my Rabbi
Davidis, as Rabby David has it, out of Kabuenaki.

Verse. 14. We took sweet counsel together] It was my great delight to confer
and consult with him, Religio a religand^.
especially about the things of God, and the exercises of Religion; which is or
should be sacratissimum inter homines vinculum, the straitest tie of all.

And walked unto the house of God in company] But so do those false Italians,
who carry a pocket-Church-book with a pistol hid in the binding, which turning
to such a page discharges; Il Mercurio Italico, Introd.
a plot to entrap him whom they hate, even while they are in their devotions
together, when there is lest suspicion.

Verse. 15. Let death seize upon them] Irruat super illos mors, as a merciless
Landlord, as a cruel creditor, or as he in the Gospel who took his fellow by
the throat and said, Pay that thou owe me. A sad time it must needs be with
the wicked, when death shall come upon them with a writ of Habeas corpus, and
the Devil with another of Habeas animam. Capiat illos mors, so Aben-Ezra
renders it, Exigat mors in eos, so Kimchi, a (...) Psalm. 89.2^. Here it is
written says he, without an Aleph, as it were with a swift hand; and as if
death and seize were all one word; to note the sudden stroke of death, and that
it will soon dispatch them: To which sense also some render it, Decipiat eos
mors, Let death deceive them; be too nimble for them.

And let them go down quick into Hell] As did Dathan and his accomplices, Numb.
16. See on verse 9. According to this imprecation, Ahitophel and Judas hanging
themselves, went to Hell alive, that is, hail and well; not infeebled by
sickness first. Augustine says, that Heretics do the like, falling with open
eyes, and self-condemned.

For wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them] Heb. In their so
journing-place (for here we are but guests or sojourners) and in the middle of
them, that is, in their hearts and houses both, undique circumfluunt malitia
and maleficiis, they are as naught as need to be.

Verse. 16. As for me, I will call upon God] Or, I have called upon God, sc.
for good to be done to my self, verse 1. etc. and for evil to mine enemies,
verse 9. etc. (of which sort of imprecations, see the Note on Psalm. 35.4.)

And he has heard mee] I know he has, both for my, self, verse. 17, 18. and
against them, 19, 20, 21. for why? first, they fear not God, 19. secondly, they
break covenant, 20. thirdly they use deceit, 21. These courses will work their
ruth and ruin.

Verse. 17. Evening and morning, and at noon will I pray] So Daniel prayed three
times a day, chap. 6.10. and in the Temple they prayed at the third, sixth, and
ninth hour of the day. The Saints set themselves certain hours to pray in
(besides extraordinary occasions puttin^ them upon that daily sacrifice) the
better to arrouse their spirits, and to keep constant intercourse with God.
Papists have their set times; and Mahometans, what occasion soever they have,
either by profit or pleasure, to divert them, will pray five times every day.
This they do of form and custom, not of conscience; take we heed of those
ordinary marre-goods, formality, and customarinesse: it has been bewailed
before, that many hold only a certain stint of daily duties (as malt-horses
their pace, or mil-horses their round) and rest upon them when they have done,
using the means as Mediators; and so fall short of Christ.

And cry aloud] Rousing up my self, and wrestling with God, not in a customary,
frigid, bedulling way; but with all intention of spirit, and contention of
speech.

And he shall hear my voice] How should he do otherwise, I coming upon him
with such earnestness? Preces fundimus, caelum tundimus, misericord^as
extorquemus, said those Primitive Christians whose prayers came before God as
the noise of many waters, Rev. 14.2.

Verse. 18. He has delivered my soul in peace from the battel] This he
speaks upon his prayer, by the force of his faith; as being assured of
victory before the battle was fought, or stroke struck, as they say.

For there were many with mee] i.e. Gods holy Angels, as 2 King. 6.16, 17. Vel
multi ex Israele orantes pro Davide, sic Aben-Ezra.


Verse. 19. God shall hear] sc. My prayers which are on the file before him, and
as Sollicitours with him. Mittamus preces and lachrymas, cordis legatos, says
Cyprian: Up go prayers, down come deliverances.

And afflict them] Ludit ambiguitate verbi; The same word signifies to
afflict, and to answer, q.d. he shall answer me, but afflict them; answer them
with blows, with bitter answers.

Even he that abides of old] And is therefore no changeling; Sedet Deus ad
judicandum, and surgit ad puniendum. Aug.
the Eternity of Israel cannot lie, nor repent; for he is not a man, that he
should repent, 1 Samuel 15.29. neither can mine enemies hide themselves from him
in any starting-holes.

Selah] Id est, modo honorabili, says R. Gaon. Or, So be it, O Lord. It is set
in the middle of the verse, as respecting both parts of it.

Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God] Changed they are
not by repentance (which is such a change of the heart, as brings forth a
reformed life) but continue obstinate and obdurate; neither have they any
alterations in their outward estate; they are not poured from vessel to
vessel, have a constant prosperity (such as Demetrius called mare mortuum, a
dead Sea) and do therefore settle upon their lees, cast away all care of God
and his service.

Verse. 20. He has put forth his hands, etc.] That wicked Ahitophel has. The
Fathers understand it of God, and his Judgments.

He has broken his Covenant] His oath of allegiance, and a particular oath
when he was sworn of David's counsel. Herod. Melp.
The Scythians were strict covenant-keepers; and the Carthaginians infamous for
the contrary; as now the Turks are.

Verse. 21. The words of his mouth were smoother than butter] Full finely he
could sooth and smooth me up, whiles he was my counselor, with his
Pithanologie.

Mel in ore, verba lactis:
Fell in cord, frans in fact is.
But war was in his heart] Heb. His heart was war; so in another Psalm David
says of himself, I am peace; but when I speak of it, they are for war.

His words were softer than oyl] So were Joabs to Amasa, Judesses to Christ;
Ctesias.
Cambyses's to his Brother whom he slew; Andronicus's to his Nobles, put to
death by him, whiles he wept over them, as if he had been the sorrowfullest man
alive. Turk. Hist. sol. 50.
Whereupon the Historian cries out, O deep dissimulation, and Crocodiles
tears. etc! The wiser sort deemed Andronicus his praysings to be the beginnings
of a man's disgrace; his bounty, his undoing; and his kindness, his death.
Agedum igitur animula mea cur te diuti^^ Excruci^s? (...)


Verse. 22. Cast thy burden upon the Lord] Dare tuum, vel Donum tuum, that is,
whatsoever thou would have the Lord bestow upon thee, cast it first by faith
upon him in prayer; even all thy cares, businesses, travels, and troubles.
This, David speaks first to himself, and then to others. R. Solomon makes
this Gods answer to David's prayer, Spiritus sanctus sic res^^ndit, says he.

And he shall sustain thee] Or, Thou shall have thy (...) thy demensum, thy due
allowance.
victual thee, nourish thee as a Foster-father; as Joseph did his father and
brethren, chepi tappam, according to the mouths of their little ones, Genesis
47.12. as Barzillas at this time nourished David at Mahanaim, 2 Samuel 17.27. and
19.32.

He shall never suffer the righteous to be moved] Or if moved, yet not greatly
moved, Psalm. 62.2. not removed. He will establish the just, Psalm. 7.9.

Verse. 23. But thou O God shall bring them down into the pit of destruction]
Into the deep Gehenna, says the Chaldee; thou shall hurl them into Hell, from
their lofty tops here.

Blondy and deceitful men shall not live out half their days] Heb. Shall not
half their days; that is, shall be soon cut off, dye in the flower of their
age, come to an untimely end; Ad generam Cexeris, etc.
either the Sword in Battle, or the Sword of Justice shall cut them off; or
some treachery of men, or their own intemperance, or Gods immediate hand shall
make an end of them betimes, and before they come to the full age of a man, or
before they have effected their evil designs ( Luther renders it, Non
dimidiabunt negotia) or before they are in fit case to dye, Tempore non suo,
Eccles. 7.17. then when it were better for them to do any thing than to dye.
Our Richard 3. and Queen Mary, reigned the shortest while of any other since
the Conquest. Charles the Ninth of France, that bloody Prince, dyed young, of a
bloody Disease, etc. Absalom and Abitophel came to Tragical and unhappy ends;
so did all the Primitive Persecutors, those cruel-crafties.

But I will trust in thee] For safety here, and for Salvation hereafter.

PSALM. LVI.
Upon Jonath Elens Rechakim] Meaning himself, who had wished before the wings
of a Dove, Fatua columba. Hos. 7.11.
Psalm. 55.6. and was now the Dove of dumbness among Foreiners, Philistines,
those ravenous Hawks that were ready to seize and tear him. Dumb he was fain to
feign himself, and worse amongst them. See Psalm. 34. the title, 1 Samuel 21.17.
etc. and therein was more of the Serpent than of the Dove.

Michtam of David] Davidi insigne aureolum, David's Jewel, or golden ingot. See
Psalm. 16. title. This Michtam he made likely (as also Psalm. 34.) when gotten
away from Gath, he came into the Cave of Adullam, 1 Samuel 22.1.

Carmina secessum scribentis and otia quaerunt. Verse. 1. Be merciful unto me,
O God: for man would swallow me up] Soop me up (as the Hebrew word sounds)
make but one draught of me, or suck me in as a Whirlpool, swallow me up as a
ravenous wild Beast. The Devil is said to seek whom he may swallow down (1 Pet.
5.8.) at a gulp, as it were; and his Imps are as greedy, but that they are
gagged by God. The man here mentioned is Ishbibenob the brother of Goliath,
says the Chaldee: but they do better, who understand it of Saul, and his
accomplices.

He fighting daily oppresses me] Pliny says of the Scorpion, that there is
not one minute, wherein it does not put forth the sting: The like do Satan and
his Instruments.

Verse. 2. Mine enemies (or observers) would daily swallow me up] Anhelant
observatores mei. To set forth the indignity of the thing, he repeateth the
same sentence again in the plural number; noting, that there were not a few of
them bitterly bent by might and main to mischief him, a poor forlorn friendless
man.

For there be many that fight against me, O thou most High] Or, though there be
many that fight for me from on high, that is the Angels, as Aben-Ezra renders
and senseth the Text.

Verse. 3. What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.] This was bravely
resolved; Quid timet hominem homo in sin Dei positus? Faith quelleth and
kills distructful fear; but awful dread, it breeds, feeds, fostereth, and
cherishes.

Verse. 4. In God I will praise his Word] Having placed my confidence in God, I
will take his bare word for my security. He has promised to make me King, 1 Samuel 16.13. and he will not suffer his faithfulness to fail, or alter the thing
that is gone out of his mouth, Psalm. 89.33. the Word of God cannot be broken,
John 5.35. David once doubted of it, but he soon took himself up for halting,
Psalm. 116.11.

I will not fear what flesh can do unto me] Flesh is terminus diminuens: what
can proud flesh do against the God of the spirits of all flesh? Man is but
despicable flesh at the best.

Verse. 5. Every day they wrest my words] Or, my matters; they distort and
pervert every thing I say, or do, from the true intention, and all to make a
Traitor of me. That I carried my self wisely in the Court, valiantly in the
Field, faithfully toward Jonathan, cautelously for the safeguard of mine own
life, shifting as I could from one place to another; all this they say was done
out of affectation of the Kingdom, and as seeking Saul's death. So they dealt by
our Savior in the Gospel, taking that with the left hand, which he tendered
with the right, and many times marring a good Text by an ill Gloss put upon it.
So Simon the Loper served that good Woman, who made an Ewer of her eyes, and a
Towel of her hair, Luke 7.34. Men should interpret every thing the best way,
and not as Logicians do, Sequi partem deteriorem.

All their thoughts, etc.] See the Note on verse. 1.

Verse. 6. They gather themselvee together] They convene and combine to do me
mischief: and should not Gods people meet often together to counterplot such
Malignants, and to pray them down? Apol. advers. gentes, cap. 39, Number. 520.
Cum boni, cum probi coeunt, cum pii, cum casti congregantur, non est factio
dicenda, sed curia: Et e contrario, illis nomen factionis accommodandum est,
qui in odium bonorum and proborum conspirant, says Tertullian.

They mark my steps] They spy and pry into my practices, that they may take any
advantage: this calls for careful and exact walking, 1 Pet. 2.21. Heb. 12.13.

Verse. 7. Shall they escape by iniquity?] q. d. No let them never think it,
their sin will surely find them out, as cunning as they are, and since they are
so foolhardy, as to walk upon iniquities Fireworks, let them look to be
blown up; and they shall have my prayers to that purpose.

In thine anger cast down, etc.] It is Prophetical, as well as Optative.

Verse. 8. Thou tellest my wanderings] Or, thou cipherest up my stittings, and
have them in numerato, ready told up; my vagaries whilst hunted up and down
like a Partridge, and hushed out of every bush, so that I have not where to
settle. Saint Paul was at the same pass, (...) says he, we have no certain
abode, 1 Corin. 4.11. and so were sundry of the holy Martyrs and Confessors,
who wandered about in Sheepskins, and Goat Skins, etc. driven from post to
pillar, from one Country to another, God all the while noting, and numbering all
their flittings, yea all their footings, Bottleing up their tears, booking down
their sighs, as here, (...).
and Mal. 3.16. See Mat. 10.30. The Septuagint for my wanderings, or flittings
have my life; to teach us, says one, that our life is but a flitting.

Put thou my tears into thy Bottle] Heb. My tear, that is, every tear of mine;
let not one of them be lost, but kept safe with thee, as so much sweet water.
It is a witty observation of one, That God is said in Scripture to have a Bag
and a Bottle, a Bag for our sins, a Bottle for our tears; and that we should
help to fill this, as we have that. There is an allusion here in the Original,
that cannot be Englished.

Are they not in thy Book?] sc. Of Providence; where they cannot be blotted out
by any time, or tyrants.

Verse. 9. When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back] For how
should they stand before so mighty a God? Of the power of Prayer, for the
beating back of enemies, besides the Scripture, Histories are full; that famous
Victoria Halle^^iatica for instance.

Verse. 10. In God will I praise his word] The Jew-Doctours observe that Elohim,
God, is a Name importing Justice; and that Jehovah, Lord, holds out mercy,
according to that Exodus, 34.6. Jehovah, Jehovah Merciful, Grac^us, etc. But if
God should foem neither to show his Mercy upon us, nor his Justice upon our
enemies, we must nevertheless adhere to his Word, or Promise, and patiently
wait his performance; which will be as sure as he is God and Lord. See the Note
on verse. 4.

Verse. 11. In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid, etc.] When news
came to Luther, that both the Emperor and Pope had threatened his ruin, he
bravely answered, Contemptus est a me Romanus and favor and furor; I care for
neither of them, I know whom I have trusted. See verse. 4.

Verse. 12. Sunt tua post. quam Vori. Arab^
Thy Vows are upon me, O God] I am a Votary ever since I was at Gath, there and
then I vowed, that if the Lord would vouchsafe to bring me out of that brake, I
would do as became a thankful man every way. And now I am Damnatus votorum, as
the Latin expression is; Vow I must, and pay to the Lord my God; Ecce ego
Domine, Lord I am ready, do thou but set me up an Altar, and I will offer a
Sacrifice; restore me to thy Sanctuary, and I will do it exactly, in the
Ceremonies and Formalities thereof: Mean while, mine heart and lips shall not
be wanting to give thee praise in spirit and truth, I will render praises unto
thee.

Verse. 13. For thou have delivered my soul from death] Which was the very thing
I begged of thee when I was at worst, viz. that thou would save my life,
which then lay at stake; I also then solemnly took upon me such and such
engagements, which lie upon me as so many debts, and I am in pain till I have
paid them. This if I shall do effectually,

Wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling?] Yea, I know thou will, Lord, for
every former favor of thine is a pledge of a future.

That I may walk before God in the light of the living] Called elsewhere the
Land of the living; that is in this present life, spending the span of it in
thy fear, and laboring to be every whit as good as I vowed to be when I was in
great distress and danger. Pliny in an Epistle of his to one that desired rules
from him how to order his life aright, I will, says he, give you one rule that
shall be instead of a thousand, Ut tales esse perseveremus sani, quales nos
futuros esse profitemur infirmi; i. e. That you hold out to be such when well,
as you promised to be when weak and sick, etc.

PSALM. LVII.
ALtaschith] i. e. Destroy not; David being in an imminent danger of
destruction in the Cave, (...) Sept.
might send up this short request as it were in a fright, before he uttered
this ensuing prayer. Altaschith in such an exigent might well be an effectual
prayer; as was the Woman of Canaans, Lord help me, and the sick man's, Ah
Father; or these might now be his words (to Abishai, or some other of his
Servants, whose fingers even itched to be doing with Saul) as afterward they
were upon a like occasion, 1 Samuel 26.9. Destroy not Saul. See thou do it not.

Michtam of David] See Psalm. 16. title.

When he fled from Saul in the Cave] 1 Samuel 24.1. Or, into the Cave for
shelter; and where when he might have cut Saul's throat, he cut his Coat only,
and was inwardly checked for it; nevertheless the Spirit came upon him, which
was no small comfort, as Aben-Ezra here observes, and he said.

Verse. 1. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful] q. d. Now or never help at a
dead lift. Bis pro more rogantium, ad corrober andum, says Kimchi. Other
Jew-Doctors give this reason of the repetition of his petition, Be merciful,
etc. lest either I fall into Saul's hands, Midr. Tilli.
or Saul into mine; lest desire of revenge prick me on to kill him. Or, Have
mercy on me, that I sin not; or if I do sin, that I may repent.

For my soul trusts in thee] An excellent argument, so it comes from the
soul, so it be heart-sprung.

Yea in the shadow of thy wings, etc.] As the little Chicken in danger of the
Kite hovereth, and covers under the Hen.

Until these calamities be over-past] For long they will not continue; Nubecula
est, site transibit, said Athanasins of the Arrian Persecutions, which for
present were very sharp. So Master Jewel about the beginning of Queen Mary's
reign, persuading many to patience, said often, Hac non durabunt aetatem, this
sharp shower will soon over.

Verse. 2. I will cry unto God most high] Who can easily overtop Saul, as high
as he is, and all his accomplices; against whom I have this comfort, that in the
thing wherein they deal proudly, God is above them, Exodus 18.11.

Unto God that performs all things for mee] And in me, Isa. 26.12. does not
his work to the halves, but is both author and finisher of my faith, and other
affairs, Heb. 12.2. Phil. 1.6. Psalm. 138.8. Here are the two props of David's
prayer, First, Gods sufficiency, he is the Most High. Secondly, his efficiency,
he perfectly accomplisheth all things for me.

Verse. 3. He shall send from Heaven and save mee] Rather than fail, I shall
have an Angel to rescue me; for although the Lord usually works by means,
yet he can work by miracles, and will do it, if there be a just occasion;
howsoever, his mercy and his truth he will be sure to send, and that is enough.
He will be seen in the Mount, he will repent for his servants when he se^th
their power is gone, Deuteronomy. 32.36. when there is dignus vindice nodus, an
extremity fit for divine power to interpose.

Verse. 4. My soul is among Lions] And so is a lively picture of the Church in
all ages. Would any man take the Churches picture, says Luther? then let him
paint a silly poor maid sitting in a wood or wilderness, compassed about with
hungry Lions, Wolves, Boars, and Bears, etc. Talis est Ecclesia in has vita,
sicut and in historia Danielis pingitur.

And I lie even among them that are set on fire] sc. With rage and hellish
hatred: Others expound it actively, of those Ardeliones anlici, those
Court-Incendiaries, who enraged Saul and the Nobles against David; as a
traitor and Pest. See 1 Samuel 24 10.

Even the sons of men] i. e. Carnal men, that being in their pure naturalls,
have no goodness at all in them.

Whose teeth are spears and arrows] Such was Doeg that dead dog, and others
void of the Spirit, which is, neque mendax, neque mordax.

Verse. 5. Be thou exalted O God above the Heavens] That is, says the Chaldee,
above the Angels.

And let thy glory be above all the Earth] That is, above the inhabitants of
the earth. There are, says Kimchi, that think thou either wilt not, or else
can not save; O let thy power appear for the conviction of all such who now
lift up themselves, and seem at least to touch the Heaven with one finger.

Verse. 6. They have prepared a net for my steps] So that I can hardly keep foot
out of snare: I dare not lift up one foot till I find sure footing for the
other; and that is hard to do. See Saul's charge to the Z^phites, 1 Samuel 23.22.

My soul is bowed down] I am glad to shrink in my self (as fearful people use
to do) that I may shun those gins and snares that they have set to maim and
mischieve me.

They have dug a pit, etc.] They have forced me into this subterranean
cave; and behold Saul himself is cast into mine hands, in this mine hiding-hole.

(...). Verse. 7. My heart is fixed O God] I am both ready and resolute: I doubt
not of deliverance, and am well prepared to praise God. It is fit he should
have the fruit of his own planting, and that of the best too: Otherwise, it is
no better than the refreshing of him that stands by a good fire; and says
Aha, I am warm.

Verse. 8. Awake up my glory] He rouseth himself out of his natural drowsiness,
as Sampson once went forth and shook himself.

I my self will awake early] Or, I will awaken the morning, as the Cock by his
early crowing, is said to do.

Non vigil ales ibi cristati cantibus oris Evocat auroram -- Ovid. Metam lib.
11.
Verse. 9. I will praise thee O Lord -- Among the Nations] This was done by
Christ calling the Gentiles, Psalm. 18.49. Romans 15.9.

Verse. 10. For thy mercy is great, etc.] Gods mercy is ordinarily in the Psalms
bounded by his truth; that none may either presume him more merciful than he
has declared himself in his word; or else despair of finding mercy gratis,
according to his promise.

Verse. 11. Be thou exalted, etc.] Versus amaebaeus, see verse. 5. only that is in
way of prayer; this, of praise.

PSALM. LVIII.
Verse. 1. Una ligati, ut Genesis 37.7. vel. ab ^^N Mutus quia congregatio ante
oratorem eftquasi mutus. Aben-Ezra.
Do ye indeed speak righteousness O Congregation?] Or, O Council; you that
are gathered together on a knot, under a pretense of doing justice, and
promoting the public good by giving faithful advice to the King. Colloquitur
Abner^ and reliquis, says Kimchi, David here talks to Abner and the rest,
who to please Saul pronounced David a rebel, and condemned him absent for an
enemy to the State. And for as much as there is no greater injury than that
which passes under the name of right, he sharply debateth the matter with them
whom he knew of old to be very corrupt; painting them out in their colors, and
denouncing Gods heavy judgments against them for their unjust dealings with
him. The word rendered Congregation is not found elsewhere in that sense. It
signifies dumbness; and is by the Spanish translators rendered, O audiencia,
by Antiphrasis, ut lucus, quia non lucet.

Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?] i.e. O ye carnal profane persons
that savor not the things of the Spirit, q. d. ye are fit persons to make
Counselors of State. Seeds prima and vita ima agree not. Dignitas in indigno
est ornamentum in luto, says Salvian. You do much mis-become your places.

Verse. 2. Yea in heart you work wickednesse] There the Devil works it as in
a forge; ye are always plotting and plowing mischief, and that not so much for
fear of Saul, or to please him, as out of the naughtiness of your own hearts;
and all this you know in your consciences to be true. Kimchi says, that the
word Aph or yea imports, that their hearts were made for a better purpose;
and therefore their sin was the greater. Corruption optimi p^ssima.

You weigh the violence of your hands in the earth] i.e. Your bribes, says
Kimchi; these ye weigh or poise, Manus ves^rae ^oncinnant iniquitatem. Vul.
quasi essent recta, as if there were no hurt in them; so Demosthenes weighed
Harpalus his goblet, to the great danger of his Country, and his own indeleble
infamy. The Arabic renders it, Manus vestra in tenebris immerse sunt, your
hands are drowned in darkness; you seem to do all according to law and Justice
(pictured with a pair of balances in her hand) when indeed you weigh out wrong
for right, Trutina justior. Prove. (...). Pythag. Symb.
and do things (...), by partiality, 1 Timothy 5.21. by tilting the balance o't'one
side.

Verse. 3. The wickedare estranged from the womb] q.d. These enemies of mine are
old sinners; hardened and habituated in wickedness from the very womb; it has
also grown up with them, and quite turned away their hearts from God and
goodness, whereunto they stand utterly across, and have an innate Antipathy,
they are not only averse thereto, but adverse also; yea to their sinews of Iron
they have added brows of brass, Isa. 48.4. sinful indeed we are all by nature,
and a birth-blot we bring into the World with us, making us strangers to, and
strayers from God. But some God sanctifies even from the womb, as he did
Jeremy; and some by the light of nature, not altogether extinct, and by Gods
restraining grace are reigned in from notorious outrage in sin. Whereas others
cast off by God, and suffered to walk after their own hearts lusts, in pe^us
indies proficiunt, wax every day worse and worse, as the Apostle speaks, till
their iniquity be full, and so wrath come upon them to the utmost. But as young
Nettles sting strait, and young Crabfishes go backward, and young. Urchins are
rough so naughty nature soon appears in little ones. Va^ezatha the youngest
of Hamans sons, is by the Hebrews said to be the most malicious; and has
therefore one letter in his name bigger than the rest.

They go astray as soon at they be ^orn] Heb. From the b^^y; Partus sequitur
v^ntrem, no sooner could they do any thing but they were doing evil, lisping
out lies and slanders be^imes.

Verse. 4. Their poison is like the (...) a Serpent] Their inbred corruption
(the spawn of that old Serpent, Genesis 3.) is strong, and full of infection, able
to kill both the party in whom it is, and the other also upon whom it is cast.
Malice drinks up the most part of its own Venom, but some it spetteth out
upon others; for it is not like the Maid whom Avi^en mentions, who feeding
upon Poison was her self healthy, yet infected others with her venomous breath.
Deuteronomy. 32.31
Hot poy^on have they, like as the Hot poison of a Serpent (so some render it)
yea of the worst sort of Serpents, the Asp (for Serpentum quot colores tot
dolores, Lib. 8, c. 3
says Isidore) the venom whereof is incurable, says Pliny; unless the
members touched therewith be immediately cut often.

They are like the deaf Adder (or Asp) that stops her ear] So that their
naughtiness is not natural only, but habitual, acquired, wilful; they refuse to
be reformed, they hate to be healed, and must therefore be turned over to God
with a Noluerunt incantari, they would not be reclaimed, they are
uncounselable, unperswadeable,. The Adder, or Asp here has her name Pethen
from perswadeableness; but it is by Antiphrasis. Wicked men are likewise said
to be (...) unperswaded, or disobedient, Tit. 1.16. and children of
disobedience, Ephesians. 2.2. such as whom Non persuadebis etiamsi per suaseres,
speak you never so perswasively, ye shall never persuade. Nay, but we will
have a King, said they of old, when they had nothing else to say. So Pharaoh,
when clearly convinced, sent for the Sorcerers.

Verse. 5. Which will not hearken to the voice of Charmers] Such there are, Vide
Plin. lib. 2 c. 7 and l. 8. c. 3. Q^um caeperet incantatore^^ suum pati,
allidit unam aurem terrae and caud^ obrurat alteram Aug. in (...) Horat. Epist.
2
the Devils spel-men, Eccles. 10.8. that can inchant some kind of Serpents, and
some they cannot, as Jerem. 8.17. That the Serpent here spoken of, when she
begins to feel the Charmer, clappeth one of her ears close to the ground,
and stops the other with her tail, is affirmed by Hierom, Austin, and
Cassiodore. And that she does this, although by harkening to the Charmer
provoking her to spet out her poison, she might renew her age, is affirmed by
others; semblably, perverse people will not be persuaded to live happily, reign
everlastingly.

-- At Paris ut vivat rog^etque beatus,
Cogiposse negat.
Verse. 6. Break their teeth, O God] Disarm, and disable them from doing me
mischief. See Psalm. 3.7. and 10.13. and 57.4. to which last he seems here to
refer.

Verse. 7. Let them melt away as waters] As Snow-waters before the Sunbeams,
quickly melted, and soon drunk in by the dry earth, Job 24.19. In Pern, they
say, there is a River called the Diurnal-river, or the Day^river, because it
falls with a mighty current in the day, but in the Night is dry, because it
is not fed by a Spring, but caused merely by the melting of the Snow, which
lies on the Mountains thereabouts.

When he bends his how] i.e. Let him be utterly frustrated, let all his
mischievous designs and endeavors be blasted, and come to nothing. In that
famous Battle betwixt Theodosius and Maximus, Milites nobis qui aderant
retulerunt, De civ. Dell. 5. c. 26
says Augustine, extorta sibi esse de mantbus quacunque jaculaba^tur; cum a
Theodosii partibus in adversaries vehemens ventus iret; and non solum quacunque
in eos jaciebantur concitatissime raperet verum etiam ipsorum tela in eorum
corpora retorqueret, the Soldiers told us, Iithmalalu reciprocam haber
significationem. Et hoc Saul's contigit.
that their Darts thrown against the Christians, were by a violent wind brought
back upon themselves. Accordingly some render this Hemistick thus; When he
bends, etc. let him be as they that cut off themselves.

Verse. 8. As a snail which melteth] The Psalmist heapeth up many very fit
Similitudes agreeable to these men's avarice and ambition, which was to raise
themselves and their posterity to great estates: but all should come to nothing
suddenly.

Verse. 9. Before your pots can feelth^ th^rns, etc.] Of this Text we may say as
one does of another, it had been easy had not Commentatours made it so knotty.
Proverb. (...) 2. l. 2. Prove. (...)
I am for that of Drusius, Tractum a semicrudis car^ibus olla exiractis
priusquam ignis calorem senscriut; It Is a comparison taken from raw flesh,
taken out of the pot before it has felt the full force of the fire.

Both living and in his wrath] i.e. When they are most vigorous and vivacious,
to see to, his wrath shall sweep them away.

Verse. 10. The righteous shall rejoice, etc.] giving God the glory of his
justice against his enemies, and care of his poor people. See Exodus 15.1. Rev.
15.3. H^st. 7.10. and 8. and 9. Prove. 11.10.

He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked] A speech borrowed from
great Conquerours, wading up to the anckles in the blood of their enemies; or
as some think, from those that tread the Wine Press with joy. Some make this
the sense, the righteous seeing the ruin of the wicked shall become more
cautious: according to that, Alterius perditio ^ua sit cautio.

Verse. 11. So that a man shall say, verily there is a reward] Not the religious
only, but the rational, Passim and palam h^c duo profitebuntur, shall every
where, and all abroad say, as here,

There is a reward] See my Righteous man's recompense.

Verily he is a God that judges the earth] Sits not idle in Heaven, letting
things run here at sixes and sevens, as Fate or blind Fortune will. C^riosus
est, plenusque negotii Deus, says Cicero.

PSALM. LIX.
ALtaschith] Destroy not, preserve me from this Ambuscado. See Psalm. 57. title.

When Saul sent, and they watched the house] But were disappointed by Michal
shifting him out of the way, preferring an Husband before a Father, though she
had otherwise no great goodness in her. The glory of this deliverance David
wholly ascribes to God, and seeks help of him.

Verse. 1. Deliver me from mine enemies, O God] This Psalm is the same in
substance with those afore-going, viz. David's desire to be delivered from Saul's
craft and cruelty.

Defend me from them] Heb. Set me on high, far out of their reach.

Verse. 2. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity] Saul's Assasines, and
Bloud-hounds, hired to dispatch me.

Verse. 3. R. Obad. Gaon in loc.
The mighty are gathered against me] The seven sons of Saul (say the Rabbines)
who were afterward hanged, 2 Samuel 21. with a company of cutthroats attending
them.

Verse. 4. They run and prepare themselves] At Saul's command, never inquiring
into the cause, right or wrong; but taking his will for warrant good enough.

Awake to help me] Heb. to meet me, sc. in mercy, Ut occurras and succurrat
mihi, or, at my calling, as some render it.

And behold] See the Note on Psalm. 34.15.

Verse. 5. Awake to visit all the Heathen] These Paganish Israelites, who might
have some Heathens also amongst them, Saul's Slaughtermen, men flesht in blood.

Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors] Heb. That treacherously work
iniquity, that do it Consulto and data opera. Desperado^s, Reprobates, destined
to eternal destruction.

Verse. 6. They return at evening] sc. To mine house at Gibeah of Saul, hoping
to find me then at home again; as if like the hunted Hate, I must needs return
to my old fourm.

They make a noise like a Dogge] When coming the second night also they missed
of David, they barked and houled like mad Dogs, ready to take every one they
met by the throat.

And go round about the City] Ferretting, and searching after him in all
places, and perhaps surrounding the City to surprise him.

Verse. 7. Behold they b^lch out with the^r mouth] Calling me Traitor where ever
they come, and seeking to double murder him, viz. by detraction, and by deadly
practice. As a fountain casts out waters, so do graceless men wickedness,
Jer. 6.7.

Swords are in their lips] Or, To their lips they add swords, they word it not
only, but are armed and well appointed. But it is well that they blurt out
their bloody purposes, and so give warning. Hu^c tibi p^gionem mittit Senat^
(...) faci^u^ fat^^ etc non implevit.

For who, say they, does hear?] i.e. Who, that we need care for? David's friends
they thought durst not utter their discontent; and for God, they took no great
thought, Psalm. 10.3.8.55.20.

Verse. 8. But thou, O Lord, shall laugh at them] q. d. Thou not only hear,
but jearest at their madness, and wilt bring all their purposes to naught with
little adoe^ and as it were, playing and sporting. See Psalm. 2.4.

Verse. 9. Because of his strength will I wait on thee] The stronger Sa^l^^ the
more will I adhere to thee. Or thus, His strength will I reserve to thee; that
is, I will turn him over to (...), who a^ far stronger, to take an order with
him; to put a hook into his nose, and a bridle into his jaws, and to bring me
at length to the Kingdom.

For God is my defence] Heb. My high place; therefore what need I feat him, or
his Emissaries.

Verse. 10. The God of my mercy shall prevent me] Or, God will prevent me with
his mercy, sc. before I ask, or think, howsoever, in the opportunity of time,
he will not fail me.

God shall let me see, etc.] See Psalm. 54.7.

Verse. 11. Slay them not, l^st my people forget] Marcet sine adversary virtus,
the natural heat decays if it have not wherewith to wrestle, Carthage was not
to be destroyed, that Rome might not want an adversary. The Saints have the
relics of corruption left in them for exercise of their graces. Slay them
not, says David; and the Chaldee adds, statim, forthwith, or outright, but
by degrees rather; lest my people, my followers and fellow soldiers, forget
their skill in arms, or thy judgments on the enemies.

Scatter them by thy power] That they may wander as Cain did, and be restless.
Or, shake them to and fro as meal is shaken in a sieve; let them be dissipated,
and by degrees wasted, that they may be as so many standing monuments of the
divine Justice, ut ^o sint illustriera and test atiora tua judicia, as the
dis-jected people of the Jews are at this day.

Verse. 12. For the sin of their mouth, etc.] The Arabians have this proverb,
Take heed lest thy tongue cut thy throat. Many a man's mouth is a purgatory to
the Master. Hard words must be reckoned for, Jude 15. the Jews find it so, and
will do.

And for cursing, etc.] Cursing men are cursed men.

Verse. 13. Consume them in wrath, etc.] But by degrees, as verse. 11. slowly,
Paulati^^ seu gradatim and in fine penitus corruant. Kimchi.
but surely and severely; that they may feel themselves wasted. There may be
much poison in little drops.

And let them know] Know to their cost. Or, Let men know.

Verse. 14. And at evening let them return, etc.] Let these back-sliders in
heart be filled with their own ways; run about for hunger, as before they did
for malice, verse. Revertantur famelici. Vat. Sit poena little sicut peccatum,
Kimchi.
6. Here the Prophet minds to mock them, says an Interpreter.

Verse. 15. Let them wander up and down for meat] Sicut mendici de ostio ad
ostium faciunt, as Beggars do from door to door, says Kimchi.

And grudge if they be not satisfied] Murmr against God and men, howling
against Heaven as hungry Woolfs, Isa. 8.21. Others understand it thus, Lee them
run to and fro for meat, that is, to devour me, as Psalm. 27.2. but surely they
shall not be satisfied (but miss of their design) thou^h they tarry all night,
watching for me.

Verse. 16. In the morning]. That time wherein they thought to have surprised
me, 1 Samuel 19.11. but thou have secured me. See Isa. 65.14.

Verse. 17. O my strength] All David's strength was derivative; in himself he was
weak as water.

PSALM. LX.
UPon Shushan Eduth] An Instrument so called, or to the tune of some song so
cas^^. The words signify the Lil^y of the Testimony, or, of king (...);
whereof many make manyfold constructions, but they are all conjecturall.

Michtam of David, to teach] The Hebrews have a proverb Li^lm^d l^tammed. Men
must therefore learn that they may teach. Psalmo doctrinal. Hisp.
David here imparteth what he had learned of Gods goodness; and would teach
others, especially when they go to war, as ( Judge. 3.2. and 2 Samuel 1.18) to
call upon God, and to lean upon his promises; as himself had done with singular
success.

When he strove with Aram Naharaim] Cum rixaretur, (...). Mesopotomia, called
here Aram Naharaim, lay between those two famous rivers. Euphrates and Tigris;
and so seems to have been a part of that earthly paradise, Genesis 2. whereof
since Adams Fall, and Noah's Flood, cecidit (...) spina, says One, the rose is
gone, the thorn only remains. A Country fruithall beyond belief, as Her^datus
has it; but inhabited by such as here joined with the Ammonites and other
enemies of the Church; and were therefore sought by David, and at length
vanquished. See 1 Chronicles. 19.

And with Aram Zobah] Or, Caelesyria, whereof Damascus was the Metropolis.

When Joab returned] sc. From the slaughter of the Syrians.

And smot of Edom] That is, of the Edomites, who had set upon Israel in the
South, when Joab with the army was fighting against the Syrians in the East.
Joab therefore at his return took them to do; and slew twelve thousand, after
that Abishai had first slain six thousand of them, all which eighteen thousand
are said to have been slain by David, as being Rex and Radix victoriae, says
Kimchi, the King and Root of the victory, 2 Samuel 8.13.

In the Valley of salt] Where Abraham had once fought with the four victorious
Kings, Genesis 14. and afterward Amaziah with the Edomites, likewise slaying ten
thousand, 2 King. 14.7. In the midst of these conflicts and bustles, David is
thought to have written this Psalm, together with Psalm. 44. and 108.

Verse. 1. Aber.-Ezra.
O God thou have cast us off] Some gather from this sad complaint, that David
was sometimes worsted in these wars; though it be not particularly so recorded
in the Scriptures. Dubia est Martis alea, (...), 2 Samuel 11.25. the best cause
has not always the best success, Jud. 20.21, 25. Others think that the
Psalmist here complains of the sad condition of the Israelites after that
Saul was slain in Mount Gilboah, and the Philistines tyrannized at their
pleasure, 1 Samuel 21.7. Whereupon also followed those civil dissentions and
seditions, whilst some of the Tribes set up Ishbosheth, and others went after
David. These miseries he here mentions the rather, that Gods goodness in the
present settlement of the Kingdom might the better appear. Hence most
Interpreters read the words in the preterpluperfect, Thou had cast us off,
thou had scattered us, etc. but now it is well with us for the present; and
better yet it will be.

Verse. 2. Thou have made the earth to tremble] By sundry fearful and dismal
fractions and concussions in our state.

Thou have broken it] In allusion to Earthquakes.

Heal the breaches thereof] Remedy the disorders, and cure the diseases, like a
good Physician. The Greeks call a King (...) ab (...) Medela, from his
healing-office, God is Jehovah the Physician, the sun of Righteousness has
healing under his wings.

For it shaketh] Nutat ac mox ruitura videtur, it will surely down, if not
timely shored up.

Verse. 3. Thou have showed thy pe^^ hard things] God will be sure to plow his
own ground, whatsoever becomes of the waste; and to weed his own garden,
though the rest of the World should be let alone to grow wild.

Thou have made (...) drink, the wine of astonishment.] Vinum vacillationis, we
are intoxicated with our afflictions, according to that Deuteronomy. 28.28, 34. we are
drunk with them, Fuimus obstupefacti tanquam venefica potione.
or rather mad, and put quite besides all faith and hope in a manner.

Verse. 4. Thou have given a banner] All the forementioned had formerly befaln
them, but now it began to be better, the scene to be altered, banners erected,
and displayed in token of victory, and for a singular sign of Gods favor, in
that juncture of time and depl^red condition of theirs.

Because of their^th. Sc^^h] Heb. From the face of the (...), that is, (...)
reference with thy promises, which thou failest not to fulfill.

Verse. 5. That thy beloved may be delivered] Heb. Thy darlings, those that fear
thee, verse. 4. for, for their sakes it is, that God does good to a people; to
all others he seems to say, as Elisha once did to Jehoram that wicked King of
Israel, what have I to do with thee, etc? Were it not that I regarded such and
such people, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee, 2 King. 3.13, 14.

Save with thy right hand] Heb. save thy right hand, which seems to be
afflicted together with us; because the enemies say, he cannot save us; thus
Kimchi expounds it.

Verse. 6. God has spoken in his holiness] He has assured me all these
following places; therefore I looked upon them long since, as already mine, and
now I am Master of them.

I will rejoyce] As having peaceable possession of all; though I have come
hardly by it. Now I see that whatsoever God by his servant Samuel assured me
of, was true, and to be trusted; albeit I sometimes doubted of it, Psalm.
116.11. 1 Samuel 27.1.

I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth] Which places though
they longest held out against me under Ishbosheth, yet now that they are come
in, they shall have civil usage under me, and be better dealt with than those
outland-enemies, Moab, Edom, etc. now brought under my subjection.

Verse. 7. Gilead is mine and Manassch] These Countries on the other side of
Jordan the Syrians happily had gotten, and now David had recovered them.

Ephraim also is the strength of my head] Because a populous and potent Tribe.
Junius thinks David here alludeth to that of Moses in his blessing of this
Tribe, Deuteronomy. 33.17. As in the next words to that of Jacob, Genesis 49.10.

Judah is my law-giver] There, viz. at Jerusalem, sits the Synedrion, Numb.
11.16. and there is my soveraign-court of Justice, Psalm. 122.5. and of that
Tribe, Christ the great lawgiver of his Church shall spring.

Verse. 8. Moab is my wash-pot] A pot wherein to wash my feet, Non vas coquendi
carnes, sed lavandi pedes. Kimchi.
a vessel of dishonor, such as at my pleasure, I will break in pieces, Psalm.
2.9. and such as I reserve of them alive, shall be my scullions and underlings,
glad to do my drudgery.

Over Edom I will cast out my shooe] i.e. Walk through their Country as a
Conqueror; Or, I will tread them under my feet; Or, Exutos mihil calceos and
in ipforum caput projectos attollere jubebo. Beza.
I will throw my shoe at the heads of them, and make them to take it up; Or, I
will make no more of subduing them, than of casting my shoe over them.

Philistia triumph thou because of mee] i.e. Cry me up for thy King; Si velis,
and videas quidin extremum eveniet, says Kimchi. Or, triumph thou over me (by
an irony) as thou lately did over Saul and his sons in Mount Gilboah; and as
since that time thou came forth to seek me; but wentest home again by
weeping-crosse.

Verse. 9. Who will bring me into the strong City?] Into Rabbah of the
Ammonites, which at length he got, 2 Samuel 12. and now wishes for. Kimchi
reads it in the preter-tense, who has led me into the strong Cities? who
has brought me into Edom? Have not thou O God, etc?

Verse. 10. Wilt not thou O God?] Or, have not thou, etc. The glory of all
victories is to be given to God in solidum. Strong Cities are nothing, when he
will have them subdued, and sacked.

Which had cast us off] See Psalm. 44.9. The Churches prosperity, like
checker-work, is intermingled with adversity.

Verse. 11. Give us help from trouble] Give it us whenever we need it; as
hitherto thou very graciously have done.

For vain is the help of man] As they had lately experimented in Saul a King of
their own choosing, but not able to save them from those proud Philistines. No
more could the Romans the Britans, oppressed by their Northern enemies. They
sent to Aetim the Roman Prefect of Gaul, and thus complained to him: The
barbarous enemy beats us to the Sea, the Sea beats us back to the enemy;
Dan. Chron.
between these two kind of deaths we are either murdered or drowned, etc. But
their implorations prevailed not: For Aetius at that time had enough to do to
keep his own head, and Valentinian, the Empire. The Saints comfort is, that
where human help fails, divine begins, as Philo told his Countrymen, when
rejected by Caius the Emperor.

Verse. 12. Through God we shall do valiantly] Faciemus militiam, some render
it, and it is true of the Spiritual warfare also; we shall be more than
Conquerours, even Triumphers, 2 Cor. 2.14. Meminisse oportet is it a nunc esse ad
spirituales Ecolesiae hosts potius quam adversus armatas ferro copias
referenda, says Beza, in his argument and use of this Psalm.

He it is that shall tread down our enemies] Corporal and Spiritual; this is a
part of Christ's Kingly Office, to the which he will not be wanting. Psalmus hic
est de Messia imperante, sicut David, says Kimchi, out of Derash Rabboth. This
Psalm is concerning Messiah reigning, as David did.

PSALM. LXI.
TO the chief Musician upon Neginah, etc.] Vincenti in melodiis Davidis. Vatab.
It is probable that he made this Psalm, when driven out of his Kingdom by his
Son Absalom, he took up at Mahanaim beyond Jordan, 2 Samuel 17.24. and therehence
prayed from the ends of the earth, or rather of the land, verse. 2. Howbeit R.
Obadiah says, that this Psalm is De pugna cum Aram in confinibus Israel,
concerning the battle with the Syrians in the borders of the Land. See 2 Samuel
10.14. etc. and 1 Chronicles. 19.16, amp;c.

Verse. 1. Hear my cry, O God] Heb. My shouting, my sad outcry; for he was in
great extremity, verse. 2. and seeks ease by prayer. This is the way, Job 22.21.
Philip. 4.6, 7. walk in it. Prayer has Virtutem pacativam; it does sweetly
settle the Soul, and lodge a blessed security in it.

Verse. 2. From the end of the earth] Or, of the Land. In all places men may
lift up holy hands, Sic dicit res pectu arae a quiexulabat long in bello
contra hosts. R. Sol.
1 Timothy 2.8. Job. 4.21. and speed. A desert may be a goodly Oratory.

When my heart is overwhelmed] Or, covered over, Vt fit in deliquiit and
lipothimiis, as is usual in swoones. See a like expression, Psalm. 102. title,
and Lam. 3.65. where the word rendered sorrow of heart, signifies such a
covering like a shield, such a lid put over the heart, that is suffocated, as
in the Cardica passio. David's Harp was not more out of tune, than his heart
sometimes: He prays, and is helped.

Lead me to the rock that is higher than I] i.e. Do for me that I cannot do for
my self; set me in safety.

Verse. 3. For thou have been a shelter for me] Thou have, and therefore thou will, is an ordinary Scripture-medium, and well it may: for God is
unchangeable, and his Decree for preserving his people is (as the Poet says
well) (...) irrevocable.

Verse. 4. I will abide in thy tabernacle] Et scribam mirabilia tua in
memoriale, says R. Obadiah by way of gloss; And I will there register up thy
wonderful works. Or, I shall there worship thee, and do thee acceptable service
again, though for present I am banished, or busied abroad. He says not, I
shall abide in my Palace, but in thy tabernacle, which he more highly esteemed.
Some render it, I shall dwell in thy Tent, or Pavilion Royal, making it a
metaphor from warfare, where those that are in the Kings own Tent must needs be
in greatest safety. And this sense suiteth well with the following words, I
will trust in the covert of thy wings.

Verse. 5. Hinc Graeci precationem dicunt (...)
For thou O God have heard my vows] i.e. My prayers, which had vows of
thankfulness annexed unto them.

Thou have given me the heritage] Even the sure mercies of David, grace and
glory; and inheritance in the World to come, as the Chaldee has it; besides
what we have here.

Verse. 6. Thou will prolong the Kings life] The King Christ, says the Chaldee,
who shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the
Lordshall prosper in his hand. Isa. 53.10. David himself also lived, and
reigned longer than most Kings do, being old and full of days.

And his years as many generations] sc. In his sons and successors. So Psa.
72.17. Filiabitus nomine ejus. The name of Christ shall endure for ever, it
shall be begotten as one generation is begotten of another, there shall be a
succession of Christ's name.

Verse. 7. He shall abide before God for ever] Or, He shall sit, viz. upon the
Throne a long while in his person; but for ever in his Son Christ, Luke 1.32.
and this affords sweet and singular comfort to the whole Church, and each
Member thereof; for as much as the dignity of a King cannot stand, unless his
Subjects be in safety.

O prepare mercy and truth which may preserve him] Hos duos custodes adhibe
quibus unis innitatur. Let these two (thy Mercy and thy Truth) be the
supporters of his Throne, let them be of his Lifeguard, let them be his due,
and prepared portion, as the Hebrew word Man here used signifies. Some
understand the words thus, Junius
Furnish the King with these two Virtues, Clemency and Truth, that thereby his
Throne may be established. See Prove. 20.28. and 29.14.

Verse. 8. So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever] Conclusio votiva.
Praise is so pleasing a service to God, that he indenteth with his people for
it, Psalm. 50.15. and they knowing his mind therein, do usually restipulate
that they will perform it; as holding it the least that they in conscience can
do, and knowing it the most that they are able to do. They present it therefore
to God, as that Grecian did his small gift to Augustus, saying, (...). If I had
a better thing I could well beteem it thee.

That I may daily perform my vows] Which till they be paid, a true-hearted
Votary is in pain: for he accounts them due debts to God.

PSALM. LXII.
APsalm of David] Who being well assured that his prayers in the former Psalm
were heard, and should be answered, breaks forth into this triumphant
profession of his faith. Lo here the happy fruit of faithful and fervent prayer.

Verse. 1. Truly my soul waits upon God] Waiting is nothing else but Hope and
Trust lengthened; and hereof David gives us an excellent example in his own
person, Idque tanta tamque vegeta cum magnitudine animi, cul ipsa quoque
sententiae and voc^s respondent, and that with so good a courage set forth in
suitable expressions, that he who has this Psalm by heart, and has laid it to
his heart, cannot but be transformed into the same Image from glory to glory,
even as by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 Cor. 3.18.

From him comes my salvation] Take it in the full extent, not only as it
signifies the privative part of man's happiness, but the positive part also,
and preservation therein.

Verse. 2. He only is my rock etc.] See Psalm. 18.2, 3.

I shall not be greatly moved] Non labascam multo lapsu, Vatabl. Tehom Nabi bah.
for the Lord puts under his hand. I shall not be moved greatly, or into the
great abyss (as Aben-Ezra has it) into Hell (as other Rabbines sense it) I
shall not be tempted above that I am able, as 1 Cor. 10.13. persecuted I may
be, but not relinquished; cast down, but not cast off, 2 Cor. 4.9. shaken, but
for my better settlement at last.

Verse. 3. How long will ye imagine mischief against a man?] What though I am
but a man, and in your eyes a mean despicable creature; yet know ye, that the
Lord has set apart him that is godly for himself, Psalm. 4.3. where David
bespeaketh his enemies, with like sharpness as here, for their malice and
madness against him. The Hebrew word rendered imagine is found only here, (...)
Irrnitis.
the Septuagint and Vulgar Latin render it, How long will ye rush against a
man? Austin, Quousque apponitis super hominem? sc. Onera and opprobria, how
long lay you load of injuries and indignities upon me?

Ye shall be slain all of you] Or, Will ye be murdered? Will ye run upon
the Pikes? Are you ambitious of your own ruin?

As a bowing wall shall ye be] Born down by the weight of your own wickedness.
As a bulging wall stands not long, and as a rotten Hedge, if but trod on,
breaks under a man; so shall ye be suddenly destroyed, and with little ado.
Thus he threatens his enemies, the proudest of them, being himself gotten upon
the rock that was higher than he, Psalm. 61.2.

Verse. 4. They only consult to cast him down from his excellency] Or, yet they
consult, q. d. Notwithstanding all that I can say, or that God will do to them,
they will on in their evil devises and endeavors against me; there is no
reclaming of them. Deus quos destruit dement at.

They delight in lyes] Not only he that makes a Lie, but he that loves and
delights in it when made by another, shall be shut out of Heaven, Revel.
22.15. See Romans 1. ^lt.

They bless with their mouthes] Heb. With his month, that is, every one does
so; neither is there ever a better of these glavering companions, dissembling
scrubs.

Verse. 5. My soul, wait thou only upon God] They trust not God at all, that is,
not alone. He that stands with one foot on a Rock, and another foot upon a
Quick sand, will sink and perish, as certainly as he that stands with both
feet on a Quicksand. David knew this, and therefore calls earn and earnestly
upon his Soul, (for his business lay most within doors) to trust only upon God.
See verse. 1.

For my expectation is from him] If he will not help me, none else shall; but
it is he that says, Look unto me and be saved, for I am God, and there is none
else, Isa. 45.22.

Verse. 6. He only is, etc.] Versus amaebaeus, see verse. 2.

I shall not be moved] Before it was, I shall not be greatly moved; now, upon
further exercise of his trust, it is, I shall not be moved. Ita in lucta
crescit lux fidei, and sides fit firmior: faith is made stronger by trials.

Verse. 7. In God is my salvation, and my glory, etc.] By these many Adjuncts
and Attributions David helps his faith, and quelleth the Commotions of his
headstrong affections. See Psalm. 18.2.

Verse. 8. Trust in him at all times] As well in the fail of outward comforts,
as in the abundance of them, trust him without a pawn; trust in a killing God,
as Job did.

Pour out your hearts before him] sc. In prayer, 1 Samuel 1.11. first, rent your
hearts, ut effundatur peccatum, says Kimchi, and then your them out as water,
Larn. 2.19. not as Oil, which sticks to the sides of the Vessel that held it,
but as water, that will out every drop: make a plain and full confession of all
your sins in prayer, lest God say to you of your sins, as Samuel did to Jesse
of his sons, Are these all? See the practice hereof in those penitent
Israelites, 1 Samuel 7.6. and give not over the practice of Mortification, till
you feel your hearts fall asunder in your bosoms like drops of water. If
iniquity be harbored there, prayer is obstructed; and if it do break out, it
will have the scent and savor of that iniquity upon it.

God is a refuge for us] A safe and sure refuge; not as men who are a lie,
verse. 9. and were never true to those that trusted them.

Verse. 9. Surely men of low degree are vanity] Man is a depending Creature, and
like the Vine must have somewhat to lean upon; apt he is to leave God, and
cleave to the Creature, to make either Men, or Means his refuge: David
therefore dehorteth from both, in this and the next verse; showing, that men of
what degree soever are in no wise to be confided in. The word rendered Vanity
denotes a vain light thing, such as is the breath of ones mouth, or a bubble
on the water.

Men of high degree are a lye] There is no more truth, nor assurance in them,
than in a false tale; also they frustrate men's hopes, as a barren Fruit-tree,
Habbak. 3.17.

They are altogether lighter, etc.] Put all Mankind into one bundle, into one
balance and vanity into the other, and it will weigh them down, Vt ascendant
ipsi pra vanitate simul.

Verse. 10. Trust not in oppression, etc.] In the fail of Persons, some may
think that Things may be trusted to, as Wealth, Wit, Power, etc. but especially
Wealth, 1 Timothy 6.17. Trust not to that, says the Psalmist, whether it be ill
or well gotten, unless you covet to be deceived: for First, he who gets
riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days, and is his
end be a ^ool, a poor fool God will make of him, Jer. 17.11. Male parta wa^e
dilabentur.

If riches increase] Though by means lawful and laudable, though they come in
at the street door, Policrat. l. 8. c. 4.
and not at a postern (Non minimum felicitatis argumentum Metello fuit bona
multa bono modo invenisse:) yet

Set not your heart upon them] Place not your felicity in them, think not your
selves simply the better, or the safer, for them. Be not puffed up with outward
things, as a bubble with a Childs blast in a Walnut-shel, when he has in it a
little Soap: Will thou cause thine eyes to fly upon that which is not? Prove.
23.5. An Eagle will not catch Flies (that is no Game for her) much less will
she make a flight at nothing, when there is no Game sprung at all. He is the
true rich man, who loves his riches poorly, says one.

Verse. 11. God has spoken once: twice have I heard this] The Septuagint have
it thus, Once spoke God, these two things have I heard, that is, say some, in
the Second Commandment, where mention is made of Gods jealousy and mercy,
Exodus 20.5, 6. Others, Once and again spoke God, and I have heard it. Or, God
spoke once, I heard him twice, viz. by an after-deliperate meditation upon what
I had heard; I preached over the Sermon as it were again to my self, and so
heard it a second time.

That power belongs unto God] He is well able to punish the wicked, Ezra
8.22. See the Note there.

Verse. 12. Also unto thee, O Lord, belongs mercy.] viz. To set thy Power a
work for the good of thy people. And as these two, Gods Power, and Gods Mercy,
are the two Pillars, the Boaz and the Jachin of every Believer (hence Job,
chap. 42.2. having spoken of his Power, he speaks of his thoughts of peace
toward his people) so they are sufficient proofs of the Doctrines before
delivered, and do evince the truth of that which follows.

For thou rendrest to every man according to his work] viz. Judgment to the
wicked, and Mercy to the righteous; where the Syriack interpreter gives this
good Note, Est gratia Dei ut reddat homini secundum opera bona, quia merces
bonorum operum est exgratia. It is mercy in God to set his love on them that
keep his Commandments, Exodus 20.6.

PSALM. LXIII.
WHen he was in the Wilderness of Judah] That is, of Idumea, says Genebrard,
which bordered upon the Tribe of Judah. But better understand it, either of the
Forest of Hareth, 1 Samuel 22.5. or of the Wilderness of Ziph, 1 Samuel 23.14.
where David was, In deserto desertus exul, and omnis fere consolationis inops,
not only destitute of outward comforts, but in some desertion of soul; Et sic
miserrimus, and calamitosissimus oberravit, says Beza.

Verse. 1. O God, thou art my God] And that is now mine only comfort; Divini
mellis alvearium, the Bee-hive of heavenly honey.

Early will I seek thee] Now they who seek God early, have a promise that they
shall find him. Aben-Ezra renders it, Cicut mercator gemmas, inquiramte;
(...) Mercator.
I will diligently seek thee, as a Merchant does precious Stones.

My soul thirsts for thee] Thirst is Tacl^th hattaavah say the Rabbines, the
perfection of desire. The whole life of a Christian is nothing else but Sanctum
desiderium, says Austin. How many broken spirits spend and exhale themselves
in continual Sallies as it were, and egressions of affection unto God,
thirsting after, not only an union but an unity with him?

My flesh longs for thou] Non habet haec vox socium, says Aben-Ezra; this
word is here only found: It is a notable Metaphor, says another Interpreter,
R. Solomon. Arescere exponit.
taken from Women with Child, to express the earnest affection that he had to
Godward. The Septuagint render it (...), Quam multipliciter. His soul, his
flesh, all was on a light fire, as it were, with ardent affection toward God.

In a dry and thirsty Land] Where I am hardly bestead, and at a great fault for
outward accommodations, but much more for sweet and Spiritual communion with
thee in holy Ordinances, there lies the pinch of my grief.

Verse. 2. To see thy power and thy glory] To feel those heart-ravishing
apprehensions of thine incomparable excellencies from thy self immediately; who
can be to thy people in their banishment as a little Sanctuary, Ezekiel. 21.16.
and supply all their wants out of thine All sufficiency, who art rich in mercy
to all that call upon thy Name.

So as I have seen thee in the Sanctuary] Where were to be seen the house of
God, Exodus 25.8. Deuteronomy. 12.5. the throne of glory from the beginning, J^r.
17.12. the Ark of the Covenant, Exodus 25.22. the tables of the Covenant laid up
in the Ark, Exodus 28.21. the Mercy-seat, Exodus 25.21. the Oracle, 22. Numb.
7.89. the ceremonies that showed the estate of the faithful both by nature and
by grace, and indeed were their Gospel, and Christ in figure. These were
glorious sights and signals, which therefore David dearly desired, and more
bewailed the want of them, then of all outward comforts and contentments.

Verse. 3. Because thy loving kindness is better than life] Mr. Bradford being
threatened by Stephen Gardener (then L. Chancellor) answered, I know to whom I
have committed my life, Acts and Mon. fol. 1459.
even into his hands which will keep it, so that no man may take it away before
it be his pleasure, Therefore his good will be done; life in his displeasure is
worse than death, and death in his true favor is true life. This made him and
the rest of the holy Martyrs, that they loved not their lives unto the death,
Rev. 12.11. The sight of God, though but in that dark glass of the ceremonies,
would have been better to David than life with the appurtenances, those (...),
riches, honors. pleasures, etc. See Psalm. 4.7, 8.

My lips shall praise thee] Gods love shed abroad in the heart can cause the
lips of them that are a sleep to speak, Cant. 7.9.

Verse. 4. Thus will I bless thee, while I live] I will divide my time betwixt
praises and prayers, and so drive an holy trade betwixt heaven and earth. See
Psalm. 18.3.

I will lift up my hands] i.e. Fretus tuo au^^. c.
pray, as Psalm. 141.2. 1 Timothy 2.8.

In thy Name] i.e. Cleaving to thy goodness and mercy.

Verse. 5. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatnesse] Heb. As with
fatness and fatness; his, ad corroborandum, says Aben-Ezra, q.d. I shall be
top-full of comfort, animo adipe and medullis sanctissimarum deliciarum tunrum
seginato. A soul taken up with Gods praises cannot but over-abound exceedingly
with joy, Ita ut inter Dei laudationem and nestram consolationem sit quasi
circulus perpetum and infinitus, says One; Praises increase joy, and joy
causes perpetual praises.

And my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips] Heb. Toro gu^ture lauds tuas
personabo.
With lips of jubilations or exultations, labiis canoris, as if I were in a
rapture or ecstasy.

Verse. 6. When I remember thee upon my bed] Heb. Beds, in the plural; because
he took up his lodging in many places, having Heaven sometimes for his canopy;
and well content to break his sleep for Gods service.

In the night watches] The Ancients divided the night into certain watches,
Mark. 13.35.

Verse. 7. Because thou have been my help] This was the matter of his
meditation, and hereby he helped his faith.

Therefore in the shadow of thy wings, etc.] Metaphora a pulli^ pipientibus
sub alis Matrum, says Junius.

Verse. 8. Adhaesit anima mea post te.
My soul follows hard after thee] As hard as mine enemies do after me, even
hard at heels, as we say; Sic trahit sua quemque voluptas. A Christians close
cleaving to God is the continent cause of all his comfort. This we must beg of
God, Jer. 13.11. sc. that we may cleave to God with full purpose of heart, Act.
11.23. and if he seem to withdraw, to follow him h^t-foot, and press his foot
stops.

Thy right hand upholdeth mee] For otherwise I should saint and fail in the
pursuit of thee; my short legs and pursie heart would never hold on.

Verse. 9. But those that seek my soul to destroy it] Heb. Ad pracipitium, to
hurl it down headlong, shall themselves be laid low enough, even in the f^^mie
valley where are many already like them, and more (shall come after them) Job
21.31, 32. And this assurance of his enemies downfall David had gotten by his
meditations on God, verse. 6.

Shall go into the lower parts of the earth] i. e. Into the grave at least, if
not into Hell, they shall be abyssed into Hell, into eternal perdition, says
(...).

Verse. 10. (...) Heb. (...) Ezekiel 3^.5.

They shall be a portion for Faxes] Or for any other beasts of prey, they shall
not have the honor of burial, but lie above ground, to be devoured by beasts
and birds. See this fulfilled upon Saul's accomplices, 1. Sam. 3^. and the
Antichristian (...) Rev. 19.21.

Verse. 11. But the King shall rejoice in God] i. e. I shall, who am anno^^^ed
and appointed King after Saul, and therefore doubt not to speak thus of my
self, as if I were King already. Wicked men praesemende sperant, and sperando
(...), hope groundlesly, and perish by their presumption. But true believers
tru^^ God upon his bare word, and that against sense in things invisible, and
against reason in things incredible, and according to their faith, so is it
unto them.

Every one that swears by him shall glory] By whom? not by the King (though
the Egyptians did so of old, and the Spaniards at this day in the pride of
their Monarchs, sweat by the life of their King) but by God, the sole and
proper object of an oath; for to swear by his name in due manner, is a special
piece of his service, and is here put for the whole. So then, every one that
sincerely serves God shall be glad and thankful to God that David reigns;
for now (...) (as the Raven is said to have crouped from the Capitol when
Augustus came to the Empire) all shall go well with them, according to their
own hearts desires. Dio.


But the mouth of them that speak lyes] A fault whereof, Saul's Courtiers were
deeply guilty. Some take this for a general description of all graceless and
godless persons, who are liars habitually at least; as godly men are right
swearers, and fearers of Gods name.

Shall be stopped] Either with shame and confusion, or with death, as was Saul's
and his pick-thanks. Saunders his foul mouth was stopped with famine, (as has
been above noted) that had uttered so many blasphemies against God, and so many
lies against men.

PSALM. LXIV.
A Psalm of David] Of like argument with the former. The Arabic prefaceth,
when Taluth (i.e. Saul) persecuted him. By this and many the like Psalms we
may see, that David did not complain for nothing; and his singular constancy
under so many trials, may well make us resolve as (...) did when he had read
the life of holy Hilarion, he rolled up the book and said, Well: Hilarion
(David) shall be the Champion that I will imitate.

Verse. 1. Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer] Or, in my meditation. To an
effectual prayer must concur meditation, invocation, affection, and belief of
audience, as here.

Preserve my life] Heb. Lives; so usually called for the many faculties,
operarations, revolutions, commodities of life.

Verse. 2. Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked] Or from the mystery
of evill-do^ers, from the Church malignant, that mystery of iniquity. See the
contrary, Psalm. 121.1.

From the insurrection, etc.] Heb. From their tumult, their hurricum, their
open force, as well as from their secret fraud. Let thy protection equal their
projects, who turn every stone to undo me.

Verse. 3. Who whet their tongue like a sword] The tongue in its form resembles
a flaming sword, and being set on fire of Hell it wounds deeply and
dangerously. It is ordinary with David to compare aulicas criminationes cum
a^^is castrensibus, court calumnies with warlike weapons, Psalm. 5, and 11. and
57.4. See there.

And (...) their bows to shout their arrows] Heb. Bend their arrow, that is, as
Psalm. 11.2. they bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string,
etc. See a like phrase, Jer. 9.3.

Even bitter words] Virulent and venomous quae leviter volant, non leviter
violant: for as Medius in Plutarch says, though the wound they make be happily
healed; (...) Plut. Aliquid saltem adb^reb it. Machiavel.
yet there will be still a sca^^. An aspersion, though not s^^lly believed,
leaves behind it a lower estimation of the party than before.

Verse. 4. That they may sh^^t in (...) the perfect] Innocence and integrity is
(...) target against calumny; but every Z^pyr^ shall be sure of his (...)
wrong, will shoot him down if he can.

Suddenly do they shoot at him] As the hunter when he lies hid in a bush; or
as when hedges are lined, as they call it, with musketeers, which gall and
kill.

And feel not] They are not at all touched either with reverence toward God, or
respect to man, but are utterly debauched, they ride on without reigns, etc.
There is an elegancy in the original, that cannot be englished.

Verse. 5. They encourage themselves in an evil matter] Thus he rises in his
complaint, and shows how by the neglect of piety and humanity, they were
grown obdurate and obstinate, yea confident, or rather impudent, in their evil
practices.

They commune of laying snares privily] viz. To entangle and entrap me. See
Neh. 4.11. with the Note.

They say, who shall see them?] God who is All-eye shall, but they having hid
God from themselves, think they can likewise hide themselves and their snares
from God. But (...)

Verse. 6. They search out iniquities] Abstrusissima quaeque exquisierunt; they
search the Devils Skul for new inventions, who is ready enough to lend them his
seven heads to plot, and his ten horns to push at good people. How wittily
wicked was Saul to destroy David, if he could have done it? See his counsel to
the Ziphites, 1 Samuel 23.22.

They accomplish a diligent search] Heb. A search searched, i. e. They seek out
all occasions, they try all tricks, they do all that can be done to undo me.
Whereunto he fitly subjoyneth this Epiphonema by way of exclamation, Adeo
intimum viri and cor profundum est, So deep is the inward part and heart of
man! (for so I read it) so deep and fathomlesse, so deceitful, and desperately
wicked.

Verse. 7. But God shall shoot at them, etc.] He shall overshoot them in their
own bow, pay them home in their own coin; he will deal with them lege talionis,
for he loves to retaliate, see verse 4. they shall find that he can handle his
arms a fair deal better against them, than they did against David.

With an arrow suddenly] As was Ahab, and the rich fool, Luke 12. whiles he sat
pruning himself like a bird on a bough, death fetched him off suddenly by his
shaft shot at him, and down he came tumbling. See 1 These. 5.3.

Verse. 8. So they shall make their own tongue, etc.] According to Prove. 12.13.
Psalm. 59.12. See the Notes.

And all that see them shall flee away] With horror and astonishment, Heb.
they shall wander about in their flight; this is spoken of their favorers and
abbetters fearing to fall under the like punishment, and being agitated by the
furies of their own evil consciences.

Verse. 9. Poena ad paucos, metus ad omnes.
And all men shall fear] Seeing such and such hanged up in Gibbits, as it were,
for a terror to others.

And shall declare the work of God] viz. His power and providence, which some
doubt of till thus powerfully convinced, as Claudian was by the destruction of
Ruffinus.

Abstulit hunc tandem Ruffini poena tumultum,
Absolvitque deos; and non jam ad culmina rerum
Injustes crevisse queror; tolluntur in altum,
Ut lapsu graviors ruant --
Verse. 10. Inde arripient fanctae cujuldam jicta^^^ argumentum. Beza.
The Righteous shall be glad in the Lord] Not my self only, but all the Saints
shall be comforted, confirmed, and occasioned to make their boast of God with
an holy gloriation.

PSALM. LXV.
A Psalm and song of David] Made by him, as it is thought, when the people were
delivered from that three-years famine for the slaughter of the Gibeonites, 2 Samuel 21. and that three days pestilence for David's (...), in numbering the
people, 2 Samuel 2.4.

Verse. 1. Praise waits for thee, O God, in Sion] Tibi silentium, lam tibi,
De^^, in Zion; so Beza renders it. There is first a deep silence in Sion, and
then due praise; a silence of admiration, a silence of religious a we and
devotion, such as was afterward that in the Christian Church, Revel. 8.1. or a
silence of expectation to receive mercies; and a praise by way of retribution,
for mercies received. Or, silence in all other places (not sensible of Gods
favors) but praise in the Church, where God is magnified; first, for blessings
proper and peculiar to his own people; secondly, for preserving Commonwealths,
and thereby providing graciously for Human society; and thirdly, for giving men
all things richly to enjoy, as in the end of this Psalm.

And unto thee shall the vow be performed] That is, solemn thanks shall be
rendered. Thy people stand ready pressed with their praises and memories, as
Joseph's Brethren once did with their Presents, against the time that he showed
himself.

Verse. 2. O thou that hear prayer] And art thereby known to be the true God,
1 King. 18.38, 39. and no such dull deity as the Heathens worshipped, Isa.
45.16, 19. Mic. 7.17, 18. O happy we that have to deal with such a
Prayer-hearing, sin-pardoning God, verse. 3* Basil compares prayer to a chain,
the one end whereof is linked to Gods Ear, and the other to man's Tongue.

Flectitur iratus voce rogante Deus. Unto thee shall all flesh come] And well
they may, since he keeps open house, his Mercy doors are ever wide open, as
were the doors of the Aediles, or City Chamberlains in Rome, that all who had
occasion of complaint might have free access unto them at any time. A good
housekeeper is seldom without company. Why ply we not the Throne of Grace upon
such encouragement? Why, since we are not straightened in God, are we straightened in
our own bowels? Why make we not our selves happy by asking, since we may have
but what we will of God, even all that Heaven and his Grace can afford us?

Verse. 3. Iniquities prevail against me] And seek to choke my prayers, they
prick me in the foot, as it were, that I cannot come to thee in prayer; or not
with that confidence; but that is more than needs, since

As for our transgressions, thou shall purge them away] So that if we turn
from them, they shall not hinder good things from us. No man was ever rejected
by God for his confessed badness, as sundry have been for their supposed
goodness: witness the Publican and the Pharisee, Luke 18.

Verse. 4. Blessed is the man whom thou choosest] Whom thou choosest for thy
love, and then love him for thy choice.

And causest to approach unto thee] i. e. Effectually call. Here Vocation is
fetched from the Fountain (as is also Justification in the former verse) viz.
Gods free election. See that golden chain, Romans 8.30.

That he may dwell in thy Courts] viz. To hear thy Word, and partake of thine
Ordinances. For our Savior tells the Jews, He that is of God, hears Gods
Words, ye therefore hear him not, because ye are not of God, John 8.4. our
Worship-scorners then have a black brand upon them.

We shall be satisfied] He makes himself one of the number of Gods elect (as
Paul also does often) and there-hence concludes to himself, and the rest, a
beatifical communion of all good things.

Verse. 5. By terrible things in righteousness will thou answer us] As he did
when he gave the Law in Mount Sinas, and ever after in his Oracles, and
Ordinances. God loves at once familiarity and fear; familiarity in our
conversation, and fear in his Worships; he loves to be acquainted with men in
the walks of their obedience; yet he takes state upon him in his Ordinances,
and will be trembled at in his Word and Judgments.

Who art the confidente of all the ends of the earth, etc.] i. e. of all thine
Elect abroad the whole World.

Of them that are afar off upon the Sea] The Islanders, Ut penitus toto
disjuncti abs orb Britanni.

Venice is said to be situate six miles distant from any firm Land, and built
in the heart of the Adriatic Sea, the waters whereof do flow into the City,
and beat upon it, through all the streets thereof. Now it may be hoped, that
God has many souls even in such places; Spec. Europ.
since there are thought to be no fewer than twenty thousand Protestants in
Civil it self, a chief City of Spain. It was long since foreprophesied, that
the Isles should wait for Gods Law, Isa. 42.4. and 51.5. and 60.9.

Verse. 6. Which by his strength sets fast the mountains] Why then should it
seem incredible that he will do all manner of good to his Elect, for whose sake
he made all at first, and still upholdeth all by the word of his power? so he
does also States and Kingdoms (often compared to Mountains in Scripture. See Jer.
51.25. Isa. 13.2. Zech. 4.7.) that the Lord God might dwell among men, viz. in
his Church and chosen people.

Being girded with power] With prevailing power, as the word signifies.

Verse. 7. Which stilleth the noise of the seas] Making a calm at his pleasure:
he has the Sea it self, that brutish Creature, at his beck, and check: so
has he also Devils, and master less men, who seek to subvert Civil Government,
and to lay all level. Hence it follows,

The noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people] When they are in hurly
burly, and contentions among themselves: -- Savitque animis ignobile vulgus,
Virg. Aene. (...) Piud. Horat. Od. 4. lib. 3

Jamque faces and saxa volant, furor arma ministrat.


Now it is God only that can assuage these tumults; others may stir strife, but
God only can stint it, says Pindarus. It is he alone Qui terram inertem, qui
mare temperat
Ventosum, and urbes regnaque tristia,
Divosque mortaele sque turbas
Imperio regit unus aequo.


Verse. 8. They also that dwell in the uttermost parts, etc.] And are therefore
Duri, horridi, immanes, latrociniis dediti, omnium denique pessimi; not further
distant from the Sun than from all Humanity, except the Sun of Righteousness
shine upon them, as he has done upon us here in England.

Are afraid at thy tokens] Thy notable Works, thine Executions.

Thou make the outgoings of the morning, etc.] That is, the inhabitants of
East and West, or the vicissitudes of day and night, whereby men are occasioned
to praise and glorify God. See Jer. 31.35. The Jews at this day, as they are
bound to say over an hundred Benedictions every day, so these two among the
rest; When they go forth in a morning they say, R. Solom. in loc.
Blessed be He who has created the greater Lights: And in the evening they
say, Blessed be He who causes the darkness of the night.

Verse. 9. Thou visitest the earth, etc.] i.e. With a gracious Rain, and so
make it to become an Alma parens to men and beasts.

With the River of God] With thy sweet showers coming out of the Clouds, as out
of a great Watering-pot, Pluvia de caelo replens flumin^. Aben-Ezra.
Psalm. 147.8.

Thou preparest them Corn] As a good Housekeeper does for his Family. How
easy were it with God to starve us all?

Verse. 10. Thou waterest the ridges, etc.] The forementioned mercy of God in
producing an Harvest, he further amplifieth and explaineth by the parts, that
men might be the more sensible; and not like bruit Beasts, content themselves
with a natural use of the Creature, but taste and see how good the Lord is.

Verse. 11. Thou crownest the year with thy goodness] Whilst each Month
produces its several fruits or commodities; so that the whole is as it were a
Crown Royal; but especially a year of extraordinary plenty, such as was the
last of Queen Mary, Mr. Clerks Martyrol.
when Wheat was sold for five shillings a Quarter, Malt for four shillings
eight-pence, and a bushel of Rye for four-pence.

Thy steps drop] Thy waggon-tracks; the Clouds are Gods Chariot: or,
where-soever thou passest there is plenty.

Verse. 12. Rejoice on every side] Heb. Are girded with joy, which in time of
drought seems to be clad in sackcloth.

Verse. 13. The Pastures, etc.] Here is stately Rhetoric all along.

PSALM. LXVI.
Verse. 1. Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands] Heb. All the earth;
shout aloud for joy as the people did at the return of the Ark, so that the
earth rang again. God shall one day show himself to be the God not of Jews
only, but of Gentiles also; these shall as well cry Christ, as those Jesus;
these say, Father, as those Abba. And as there was great joy in Samaria, when
the Gospel was there first received, Acts 8.8. so shall there be the like in
all other parts of the earth.

Verse. 2. Make his praise glorious] Heb. Put glory to his praise; so Josh.
7.19. Gods glory is as himself, eternal and infinite, no way capable of our
addition or detraction: howbeit to try how we prize it, and will exalt it, he
declares that he accounts himself made more glorious by us, when we receive
him into our hearts as King of glory, and praise him accordingly.

Verse. 3. Say unto God] Hereby it appears, that this among other Psalms of
like nature, was written for the perpetual use of the Church, and to serve for
a set form of praising God, as occasion required, either in public, or private.

Shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee] Heb. Shall lie unto thee;
that is, says Kimchi, shall deny that they ever did any thing against thee, or
thy people. Or rather, they shall perforce acknowledge thy power and prowess;
as Julian the Apostate did in his last Vicisti Galilae: they shall also yield
obedience to thee, such as it is, because they can neither will nor choose; this
Virtus nolentium nulla est.

Verse. 4. All the earth shall worship thee] Heb. They shall bow down to thee,
stoop to thy Government, submit to the Scepter of thy Kingdom, they shall
become the Kingdoms of our Lord Jesus Christ. O dieculam illam! O mora! Christ
veni.

Selab] Let that thy Kingdom come; come speedily, come in our days, Bimherab.
Beiamenn.
as the modern Jews pray daily.

Verse. 5. Come and see] Venite, vidite; He takes good people by the hand, as
it were, leading them to the sight of Gods stupendous proceedings, which may
not be slighted, Isa. 5.12.

Toward the children of men] For they are his chief care, and about them is his
providence principally exercised.

Verse. 6. He turned the sea into dry land] A mercy much celebrated, and not
without cause, in all after-ages.

They went thorough the flood on foot] That is, thorough the River Jordan, when
it had over-flowed the banks; and met with no enemy on the other side, to
forbid their landing.

There did we rejoice in him] We who were then in the loins of our
forefathers, and so shared in their joy. See Hos. 12.4. with the Note.

Verse. 7. He rules by his power] As sole Sovereign, universal Monarch, (...).
Sesostris King of Egypt would needs be styled (...), Emperor of the whole
World; Herod. l. 2.
he lived about the time of Sampson, and perished by the hands of his own
houshold-servants.

His eyes behold the Nations] For which purpose they run to and fro through the
earth, 2 Chronicles. 16.9.

Let not the rebellious, etc.] Heb. The off-faln, froward, and refractory
persons; these shall soon be represt, and crest-faln.

Verse. 8. O bless our God, ye people] We must not only publish Gods praises,
but provoke others also so to do.

Verse. 9. Which holds our soul in life] Heb. Puts, that is, bestows life
on us, preserves it, restores it. Some think this Psalm was made upon David's
deliverance from the Giant that sought to kill him, 2 Samuel 21.16.

And suffers not our feet to be moved] David gave back diverse paces, say the
Hebrews, but was seasonably rescued by Abishai, who slew the Philistine.

Verse. 10. For thou, O God, have proved us] Non ut ipse sciat sed ut s^ire n^s^
faciat, says Austine. God proves his people, not thereby to better his own
knowledge of them, Joh. 2.25. and 6.6. and 21.17, Acts 1.24. but to bring them
to a better knowledge of their own, both Vices and Graces. It is not known what
Corn will yield, till it come to the Flail; nor what Grapes, till they come to
the Press. Grace is hid in Nature, as sweet water in Rose-leaves; the fire of
affliction fetches it out.

Thou have tried us as Silver] The wicked also are tried, Revel. 3.10. but they
prove reprobate silver, Jer. 6.28.30. or at best, as Alchymy gold, that will
not bear the seventh fire, as Job did, chap. 23.10.

Verse. 11. Thou broughtest us into the Net] A Metaphor from Hunters, or
Fowlers; Vtitur figuris tanquam in poemate.

Thou layedst affliction upon our loyns] Co^rctationem in lumbis; we are not
only hampered, as in a Net, but fettered, as with chains; as if we had been in
the Jaylors or Hangmans hands.

Verse. 12. Thou have caused men to ride over our heads] Subjected us to the
villainies and outrages of the basest persons, who have used us more like beasts
than men.

We went thorough fire, and thorough water] That is, thorough variety of
sharpest afflictions, noted out by this Proverbial passage; Fire and Water are
merciless Elements. Aelius Pertinax fortune pila pervulgate dicebatur, quod
variis casibus exercit us fuit. It is the true Christians comfort, that nothing
befalls him but by a sweet providence; and that God goes along with him into
both fire and water, Isa. 43.2. to see that he take no hurt by either.

But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place] Heb. Moist, that is, into the
air, says Aben-Ezra, (opposed to Fire and Water) where we might draw breath,
and live comfortably; In locum irriguum, in refrigerium. It is but winking,
said that Martyr at the stake, and we shall be in Heaven immediately. The
Arabic has it, Eduxisti nos ad requiem. Confer Acts 3.19.

Verse. 13. I will go into thim house, etc.] I will begin to others in that
public solemn Thanksgiving, and not grutch at the cost, I will be Vir gregis,
as the He-Goat before the flocks, Jer. 50.8.

Verse. 14. Which my lips have uttered] Heb. Have opened, that is, which I have
uttered diductis labiis, with lips wide open. Videmus qualiter vota nuncupari
soleant, says Vatablus, Here we see after what sort vows use to be made; when
we are under any pressing affliction: but when once delivered, how heavily many
come off in point of payment.

And my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble] Then, men will promise any
thing for ease and release; But what says the Italian Proverb? Sciapato il
morbo, frandato il Santo, when the Disease is cured, the Saint is defrauded.
Horace calls upon Macaenas (who in his Sickness had vowed to build a Temple)
-- Reddero victimas Lib. 2. Od. 17

Aedemque votivam memento:
Nos humilem feriemus agnam.


Verse. 15. I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings] Heb. Marrow,
the very best of the best: and better I could beteem the Lord, if I had it.

With the Incense of Rams] Which being offered infaith, and as Figures of that
great Sacrifice to come, shall be accepted of God for a sweet smelling savor.

I will offer Bullocks with Gouts] Faciam ^oves: this, Ecci^^ alleges (but
absurdly) to prove the Popish unbloudy sacrifice of the Mass; as if Christ when
he said. This do ye in (...) of me, had meant, Thus sacrifice ye.

Verse. 16. Come and hear] He had said before, Come and see, verse. 5. He held it
a greater honor, Prodesse (...) pra^sse.

All ye that (...) God] For such only will hear to good purpose, others either
cannot, or care not.

And I will declare, etc.] Communicate unto you my Soul-secrets, and
experiments; There is no small good to be gotten by such declarations. Bilney
perceiving Latimer to be zealous without knowledge, came to him in his study,
and desired him for Gods sake to hear his confession. I did so, says Latimer,
and to say the truth, by his confession, I learned more than before in many
years. Act. and Mon.
So from that time forward I began to smell the Word of God, and forsake the
School-Doctors, and such fooleries.

Verse. 17. I cried unto him] I prayed fervently and frequently.

And he was extolled, etc.] My prayers were soon turned into praises, which I
silently framed within my self, even while I was praying.

Verse. 18. If I regard iniquity in mine heart] If I have but a ^exths-mind to
it, as we say; If I cast but a leering-look toward it, if there be in me but
an irresolution against it; how much more then if I allow it and wallow in i^^
He who chooses to hold fast sin, does, by his own election, forsake mercy, Jon.
2.8. neither let such a man think that he shall receive any thing at the hands
of God, Jam. 1.7. As in a wound, a plaster prevails not, whiles the Iron
remains within; so neither prayer, while sin rankleth. God will never accept
of a good motion from a bad mouth, as that State in story would not. A man may
deliver an excellent speech, but because of his stinking breath, we may have no
pleasure to hear him: so in this case. Prayer is a pouring out of the heart, as
has been already observed. If iniquity harbor there, prayer is obstructed,
and if it do break out, it will have the scent and savor of that iniquity upon
it, and thereby displease. Kimchi makes this strange sense (quite from the
purpose, and from the truth) If I regard iniquity only in my heart, so that I
break not forth into outward act; God will not hear, i. e. so hear, as to
impute it, or to account it a sin. Pharisaice.

Verse. 19. But verily God has heard mee] As I well perceive by his answer full
and enlarged as the cloud that rises out of the earth in thin and insensible
vapors, falls down in great and abundant showers.

Verse. 20. Blessed be God, etc.] This is the conclusion of David's syllogism, in
this and the two former verses; and herein his Logic is better than Aristotle's.

PSALM. LXVII.
Verse. 1. God be merciful unto us] sc. In sending his son, and calling his
elect, both among Jews and Gentiles, to the participation of that gift, Joh.
4.10. that Benefit, 1 Timothy 6.2.

And bless us] Specially with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things in
Christ Jesus, Ephesians. 1.3.

And cause his face to shine upon us] Giving us the light of the knowledge of
the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. 4.6. who is the
brightness (or glittering refulgency) of his Fathers glory, and the express
image of his person, (...) Seren^ suo vul^^ nos irrad. et. Beza.
Heb. 1.3. the dayspring from on high, Luke 1 78. In this prayer the Psalmist
plainly alludeth to that blessing pronounced upon the people by the
High Priest, Numb. ^. and shows, that all comes from Christ the true Aaron,
the High Priest of the new Covenant.

Verse. 2. That thy way may be known] Thy way of worship, that way that is
called holy, the Gospel, Act. 19.23. and 18.25, 26. the way of salvation, Act.
16.17.

Thy saving health] That is, thy Christ, Luke 1.30, 32.

Verse. 3. Let the people praise thee, O God] Enlarge the bounds of thy Church;
and bring in the Hallelujahs of the Gentiles also. Let them praise Thee (that
pronown Thee is emphaticall and exclusive) and not their Gods of gold and
silver. Let them turn to God from Idols, to serve the living and true God, 1
These. 1.9.

Verse. 4. O Let the Nations be glad, etc.] As they cannot but be upon their
sound conversion, Act. 8.8. there being no such joy as the joy of faith, and
that a man's name is written in Heaven. Beatus Lud^vicus, would be called
Ludovicus de Pissiaco, rather than take greater titles; because there he became
a Christian.

For thou shall judge the people righteously, etc.] Not rigorously; keeping thy
Church in safety amidst the greatest ruins of the World, and collisions of
Empires.

And (...) the Nations upon earth. Selah] Heb. Thou shall g^^^ly lead them, as
(...) Shepherd does his flock, or a Father his child; Lord hasten it.

Verse. 5. Versus (...). See Verse. 3.

Verse. 6. Then shall the earth yield her increase] Omnia opera ^^stra eram
prospera, All shall go well with us, and we shall abound with blessings of both
^^es. The Gospel is a cornucopia; and they that receive it shall have all that
heart can with, or need require; all creatures shall conspire to make them
happy. The earth which was cursed for man's sin, and has lain bed-ridden, as it
were, ever since, shall put forth her utmost strength for good peoples use. God
will hear the Heavens, and the Heavens shall hear the earth, etc. Hos. 2.21,
22. when once men's hearts bear fruit to the Lord, Mat. 13.19, 23. Heb. 6.7.
Hierom interprets these words of the Virgin Mary bringing forth the child
Jesus. Others thus; Then shall the earth bring forth innumerable servants of
God.

Verse. 7. In more Nevochim.
God shall bless us] God is thrice named here and in the former verse, to note
the Trinity of persons, as Kamban wrote, and had therefore his book burnt, by
the Jews in France. And whereas it is thrice here said, God shall bless us, it
imports that the blessings here meant, are more than terrene and bodily
blessings.

PSALM. LXVIII.
A Psalm or song of David] Made at that time, when having overcome his enemies,
he brought arcam in arcem, the Ark of God into the Tower of Sion; confer
verse. 1. with Numb. 10.35. Herein also he treats of the greatest secrets of
Christ's Kingdom, and prophesies of things to come, as Act. 2.30, 31. witness
the Apostle, Ephesians. 4.8.

Verse. 1. Let God arise] He need do no more, that his enemies may be scattered,
though never so close united, e^iamsi catapbractus incedat Satan, as Luther
speaks; digitum sunns tantum moveat, and dissipabuntur hosts, Let the Lord
but stir his finger only, let him but look unto the host of the Egyptians
through the pillar of fire, and they shall be troubled, as Exodus 14.24.
funduntur and fugantur cum primum se exferit Deus, as those Philistines, 2 Samuel
5.

Let them also that hate him, flee before him] Athanasius tells us that evil
spirits may be put to flight by this Psalm; and that Anthony the Hermit fought
against the Devil with this verse, and worsted him. This may be done also as
well with other texts of Scripture. Golloq. Men's.
Luther encountered the Devil with that sentence, Thou have put all things
under his feet; Another Dutch Divine with this, The Sbn of God came to dissolve
the works of the Devil. Cramerus.
A third, with those words, The seed of the woman shall break the Serpents
head. As the rocks repel the boisterous waves -- c^nantia frangere, frangunt;
so does Christ the Rock (the stone cut out of the mountains without hands. Dan.
2.45.) all his Churches enemies.

Verse. 2. As (...) is driven away, etc.] Smoke at first sight seems
formidable; but soon vanishes; and the higher it ascends, the sooner it is
dissipated: so here. Guicciardine says of Charles the eighth of France, that
he came into the field like thunder and lightening, but went out like a snuff;
more than a man at fist, and less than a woman at last. Semblably Gods enemies.

As wax melts before the fire, etc.] Wax is a more solid substance than
smoke, but held to the fire, it quickly dissolveth. The Psalmist both prays
and prophesies here; that the downfall of the Churches enemies may be praeceps
and presentissimum, sad and sudden, as is elegantly set forth by these ^wo
similitudes.

Verse. 3. But let the Righteous be glad] When he sees the vengeance, Psalm,
58.10. (See the Note there) whilst this wise King scatters the wicked, and
brings the wheel over them, Prove. 20.26.

Let them rejoice before God] Heb. At the presence of God, from which the
wicked must flee, verse. 1. See Isa. 33.14.

Yea let them exceedingly rejoyce] Heb. Rejoice with gladness; over-abound
exceedingly with joy as St. Paul (...) 2 Cor. 7.4. Joy is the just man's
portion, which the wicked may not meddle with. Hos. 9.12.

Verse. 4. Sing unto God sing praises] (...) not in a custumers (...) help
hereunto was this Psalm (...)

Excel him that rides upon the Heavens] Exalt him so, as when a ((...) is
made up unto a great height, Beza renders it, Sternite (...) Cast upon pave
the way for him that rides in the desert. Come^^ Isai; 40.3, 4 Mat. 3.1. Mat.
3.3. The Septuagint render it, (...) Raise up the way, and make it ready (as
they use to do before Kings that ride in triumph) that the King of glory may
come into your hearts, those deserts indeed.

By his name J^h] the same with Jehovah, that proper and incommunicable name of
God. Some of the Heathens called it Jo^^ as Dioderus Sicalan^, Mack^^^^, etc.
Holy and reverend is this name, (...), Essentates, and it is here and elsewhere
given to Christ, See it interpreted Rev. 1.4.

Verse. 5. A Father of the fatherless, etc.] Pupillerum pater, and (...) vindex,
a title that God much glories in; and although he rides upon the Heavens,
and is higher than the highest, yet so low stoopeth he to our meanness; neither
will he leave his people orphans or comfortless, J^^. etc. 18. for

God is in his holy habitation] Not in Heaven only, but in and with his Church
on earth; the Ark and Mercy-seat were never sundred.

Verse. 6. God sets the solitary in families] i.e. He blesses them with
Issue. See Psalm. 113.9. and so he does the Church, Isa. 54. It in these days
of the Gospel especially.

He brings out those which are bonnd in th^ing] As he did Peter, Act 12. Paul
and Silas, Act. 16. Some read it thus, He brings out those which are bound,
in accomoditates, into places where they may live commodiously and cheerfully.
As on the other side,

The rebellions dwell in a dry land] In le^^s torridis, arridis, exsucis and
(...), in (...) and desert Countries, where they are destitute of Gods blessing
and his soul-refreshing comforts. The Hebrew word signifies a bleak or white
soil, such as is all Egypt where the Nile arriveth not, viz. a whitish sand,
bearing no grass but two little weeds, of which they make glass. Where the
river w^^^reth is a black mould, so fruitful, say travailers, as they do but
throw in the seed; and have four rich harvests in less than four months. Hence
Egypt is called The World Gra^^^y.

Verse. 7. O God when thou wentest forth before thy people] Here the former
benefits of God to his people are recited. and additis (...) coloribus (...)
potius quam descripta, and rather depainted out in lively colors, than
described. Wet must stir up out selves to thankfullness for what God has
done for our forefathers; neither must the memory of his mercies ever grow
stale with us.

Verse. 8. The earth shook, the Heavens also dropped] Velut in sudoviut soluts,
as if they had been put into a sweat; In so terrible a manner was the Law
given, that Gods sear might fall upon us, Exodus 20. As for the Gospel, it is
than (...) of Liberalities, verse. 9. confirming Gods inheritance, when it is
weary.

Even Sinai it self was moved at the prefence of God. Some render it, a facie
Dei h^jus Sinaice, a facie Dei, Dei I srael. These two verses are taken our or
(...) song, Jud. 5.4.5.

Verse. 9. Thou O God did send a plentiful rain] Heb. Thou (...) rain of
liberalities. Spiritually this means the Doctrine of the Gospel, Deuteronomy 3.^. 2
Isa. 45.8. Hos. 14.6. and the gifts of the Holy Christ bestowed hereby and
plentifully.

Verse. 10. Thy Congregation has dwelt therein (...),] thy (...), sosome render
it, and interpret it of the flocks and herds, whereby of his goodness God
prepared fot his poor, those creatures being profitable both (...). Deus
obrulit occasionem laetandi, ovandi and triumphandi.


Verse. 11. The Lord gave the word] That is, the occasion (...), de victoria
says Vatablus. How God provided his people of (...) Psalmist had told us, now
of the victory, the good news whereof shall (...) in every ones mouth, like the
word in an army, with joyful acclamations and outcries.

Great was the company (Heb. army of the forbad published (...))] Such are thy
Preachers of the Gospel, Romans 10.15. an office taken now from the Angel^^, and
given to the Ministers, where^^ that Angel turned over. (...) to (...)
information, (...). The Hebrew word for (...) is (...) continuance out (...) of
New- England) but to show the weakness of the means (fisherman and the like)
that God is pleased to use in this great work, Ut imbecillitatem ministrorum
Ecclesiae nocet. Moller.
for the greater manifestation of his power in the success, as some conceive.

Verse. 12. Kings of armies did flee apace] Heb. Did flee, did flee. Or, shall
flee, shall flee; which one interprets of Devils (called Principalities and
Powers) formerly using to give Oracles; but after Christ's birth ceasing to do
so. As also of Licius^^ and other tyrants fleeing before Constantine the first
Christian Emperor. See Rev. 9.11. Antichrist is the King of Locusts, and he
flees daily before the Evangelies, Lib. 3. de. Pont. Romans cap. 21.
the New-Gospellers, as he calls them. Bellarmine complains, that ever
since we held the Pope to be Antichrist, non mode non crevit ejus imperium, sed
semper magi^ac magis decrevit, his Kingdom has not only not increased, but
more and more daily decreased.

And she that tarried at home divided the spoil] That is, toto congregatia que
non pugnabat, says Kimchi. Or the women also (those domi porta) came forth to
pillage. These days of the Gospel do abound with many godly matrones and holy
Virgins. And it is easy to observe, that the New Testament affords more
store of good women, than the Old.

Verse. 13. Inter Chytropod^s.
Though ye have ly^n among the Pots] Quasiobruti roti and oppleti fuligine and
tenebris, black and sooty, as the black guard of an army, or as Skullions in a
Kitchen, who lie sometimes all right, like beasts, in a chimney-corner; or as
your Forefathers in Egypt, when their shoulders were not yet removed from the
burden, nor their hands from the pots, Psalm. 81.6. The meaning is, though ye
have been in a low and loathsome condition, yet now. ye shall shine and
flourish, Verba sunt maliorum, says Kimchi, these are the words of those
women, annunciatrices in the eleventh verse. Beza makes them to be the
Psalmists words to those women that divided the spoil, verse. 12. Vixistis adhuc
puella, etc. ye have hitherto dwelt at home, and washed pots, etc. but now being
enriched by the spoils, ye may come abroad fair and trim, like white Doves
with gilt feathers.

Yet shall ye be as the wings of a Dove] Ye shall fly swiftly from the storm
of cruel persecution, says the Syroack Interpreter; yea you shall shine, and
make a glorious show, ficut nivea columbae per medium aercus inter volitandum
aureum quendam splendarem ejaculantur. See Isa. 54.11, 12, 13. the Churches
bricks made in her bondage shall be turned into Saphires.

Verse. 14. When the Almighty scattered Kings in it] i.e. In the wilderness as
they passed; or in Canaan which they possessed, according to verse. 1. Or,
scattered Kings for her, that is, for his Church, or for her that tarried at
home, verse. 12. a periphrasis of the Church, in the times of primitive
persecution especially, till the Almighty scattered those persecuting Princes.
Some of the Jew-Doctors understand it of Gog and Magog.

It was white as snow in Salmon] Or, She was white as snow in Salmon; not only
as the wings of a Dove, but glorious and glittering as snow on that high hill,
Judge. 9.47, 48. At the top of the Alps nothing is to be seen but snow, which
has lain there beyond the memory of man, and as some say, ever since the
flood. The same may be as true of Salmon, which some here take for a Noun
substantive common, and render its albe sees in ^^ligine, thou shall wax white
in darkness. The old Emperor Andronicus lighting upon this verse in his
Psalter, and applying it to himself, Turk. hist. fol. 164.
was much settled and sastisfied concerning his troubles.

Verse. 15. The Hill (...) God is as the hill of Basan] Basan was fat and
fettile, but Sion was better, because the place where Gods honor dwelled, any
relation to whom does greatly ennoble any place or person: so Genesis 17.21, 22,
Israel, have blessed, twelve Princes shall he beget; but my covenant will I
establish with Is^^^, Since thou have been precious in my sight, thou have been
honorable, Isa. 4^.^

Verse. 16. Why leap ye, ye high bills?] Why do ye pride and please your selves
in your privileges of nature, so fair above this of (...), Quare (...) so some
render it, and tell us, that the original word (...) is Syriack, (...), to
irritate, to insult, or contend with any one.

This is the Hill which God desires to (...) in]. This (...) and does still of
the Church from the rest of the World. The Lamb Christ is on Mount Sion, Revel.
14.1.

Verse. 17. The Chariots of God are twenty thousand] Heb. The Chariot, to note
the joynt-service of all the Angels, who are here called, Shinan, of their
changeableness now taken away by Christ, say some: of their precellency above
other Creatures, say others, as being second or next unto God, the chief
Princes, the Nobles of that Court, as Dan. 10.13. Michael one of the chief
Princes. The Seventy render it (...), The cheerful ones such as are in joy and
tranquillity, freely serving God in all his Wars, carrying the Elect, and
marching about them.

The Lord is among them, as in Sinai] i.e. The Angels make Sion as dreadful to
all her enemies, as those Angels made Sinai at the delivery of the Law. See
Heb. 12.22.

In the holy place] Holy for the time whilst God appeared there, so 2 Pet.
1.18. Tabor is called the holy Mount.

Verse. 18. Thou have ascended on high] As a Conqueror does on his triumphal
Chariot; the Romans ascended up to the Capitol, Plut. in Aemyl.
leading their Captives bound behind them, and giving gifts unto the people.
They might have this custom from David, and these words might be the peoples
acclamation to: David, or as some think, both the Kings and peoples acclamation
to the Ark, that notable Type of Christ, to whom St. Paul applies it, Ephesians.
4.8, 9. and teaches us to understand it of his wonderful Ascension.

Thou have led captivity captive] i.e. Thou have captivated those that once
held us in captivity: for so Gods justice required, Isa. 33.1. so he had
fore-promised, Isa. 24. Rev. 13.10. and so Christ has fulfilled, Coloss. 2.15.
saving his people to the uttermost, from Sin, Death, Hell, and the Devil, who
had taken them alive captive at his pleasure, 2 Timothy 2.26.

Thou have received gifts for men] Heb. In man; some render it in Adam, Qualia
erant in Adams, talia dat Christus, says Eugubinus, Christ gave such gifts to
his people (for if he received with one hand, he gave with the other, Sed Beth
servilis non praeponitur proprio nomini.
and the fruits of his Victories are all for his Subjects) as were in Adam.
True it is, that he repaireth Gods once-lost Image in them, but the gifts here
meant are mentioned by the Apostle, Ephesians. 4 11. viz. Apostles, Prophets,
Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work
of the Ministry, for the edyfying of the body of Christ, etc. Lo these were
those gifts that Christ bestowed upon his Church at the day of his Coronation.
and solemn inauguration into his Throne, at the time of his triumphant
Ascension. These he received that he might give: and he held it more blessed to
give than to receive. A like expression we have, Hos. 14.2. Receive us
graciously, Heb. Take good, sc. to bestow it upon us, as Acts 2.23.

Yea, for the rebellious also] Rebellion at first till thou have given them a
better heart. See Romans 4.5. and 5.6. or, if they continue so, yet they may
share in common gifts, and external privileges.

That the Lord God might dwell among them] viz. in his religion and true
worshippers, for which end he gives restraining grace to the very rebellious.

Verse. 19. Blessed be the Lord who daily loadeth us] sc. With blessings, or
with crosses turned into blessings, as being sanctified, and having their
properties altered; for of themselves they are fruits of sin, and a piece of
the Curse. Let us not load him with our iniquities, etc.

Verse. 20. He that is our God, is the God of Salvation] Or, This God is unto us
a God of Salvations, in the Plural, so that he can save us, and does, from a
thousand deaths and dangers; and when he has delivered us to day, he both can
and will do it again to morrow: he has for his people omnimodam salutem.

And unto God the Lord belong the issues from death.] When we think there is no
way but one for us, he appears as out of an Engine, and pulls us out of
Deaths jaws. The Lord knows how to deliver his, 2 Pet. 2.9. from the most
desperate and deadly dangers. Peter might well say it, for he had the
experience of it, Acts 12. Christ has the Keys of death, Rev. 1.18. the sole
dominion and disposal of it. (...) mortis.

Verse. 21. But God shall wound the (...) of his enemies] (...) caput, a wound
in the head if deep (and God strikes no small blows) is mortal. Christ will
break the head of those that bruise his heel, that attempt any thing against
Him, and his. By Head here Diodate understands the Devil, that Prince of the
World, Deuteronomy. 32.42. Psalm. 110.6. Hab. 3.13. Evil spirits in Scripture are
called Shegnirim, shag-haired, Levit. 17.7. Isa. 13.21. And they go on in their
trespasses; they do infinitely hate God, and sin that sin against the Holy
Ghost every moment. But the most understand it of wicked men.

And the hairy scalp of such a one as goes on still, etc.] This is Gods enemy,
that by his wilful wickedness strikes, and as it were shoots at God, runs
upon him, even upon his neck, and upon the thick bosses of his Bucklers, Job
15.25, 26. his hairy scalp, setting forth his fierceness, Job 5.5. Note this
against Anti-Roundheads. See Ezekiel. 44.20.

Verse. 22. The Lord said] That is assurance good enough.

I will bring again from Bashan] Og the Giants Country, where Israel was in no
small distress, and danger, till that Monster was taken out of the way. Numb.
21.33. Deuteronomy. 3.1, 2. q. d. I will, if need require, and as occasion serves, do
as much for mine again, as I did once at Bashan, and at the red Sea. Some
interpret this, and the following Verses, of the calling of the Jews. The
glorious things (says one) which God will effect in their behalf are here
reduced to five heads; First, the bringing of them home from most extreme
difficulties, naming Bashan, because of the slaughter spoken of, verse. 14. and
the deep of the Sea, alluding to Exodus 14.16. peradventure he means the
drying up of Euphrates before them. For this first Head aims at those times,
the beginning of the Jews repair unto their Country. The Second Head is, the
great and famous Victory that God will give, delivering them out of those
difficulties and distresses, verse. 22. See Isa. 63.1, 2, 3, 4. The Third Head
is, the Jews thorough conversion, by occasion of that singular mercy of God,
verse. 23. and the form of a goodly Church (under the Type of the old Synagogue)
set up among Jacobs posterity, verse. 24. the Ten Tribes as well as the Tribe of
Judah, which is concluded by acknowledging their strength to come from God, a
prayer to perfect his Work begun, and a spur to put into these Kings of the
East (as they are also called, Rev. 16.12.) to present in the Temple at
Jerusalem (in the public Congregation) testimonies of their thankfulness,
verse. 25, 26, 27, 28. The Fourth Head is, the taming of their proud enemies,
and the forcing them at least to counterfeit a subjection, verse. 29. The Fifth
Head is, the general calling of all the Kingdoms of the earth to join
themselves unto the Church of Christ, which shall follow the conversion of the
Jews. And this he shuts up with provoking all Nations, to give unto God the
praises that are due unto him for it: and his own particular thanksgiving,
verse. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. Thus he.

Verse. 23. That thy foot may be dipped] Heb. Redded, imbrewed, made
gore-bloudy; Hereby is implied a very great slaughter. Confer Rev. 19.17, 18,
21.

Verse. 24. Diod.
They have seen thy goings, O God] Namely, the holy manner of conducting the
Ark with even and proportionable restings, and settings down. See 2 Samuel 6.13.
The Ark is here and elsewhere called, God, because a symbol of his special
presence. When we are called to hear Gods Word, and pray publicly, though we
see not God, ab.
yet we may see his goings: Deus enim ipse chorum agit, and primas tenet in
illo incessu.

Of my God, my King] David though he were a King, yet held himself but Gods
Mandatary, or Substitute.

Verse. 25. The singers went before, etc.] Thus they were Marshalled, when the
Ark was conducted to Mount Sion, every thing being done decently and in order.
Christ ascending into Heaven, and settling his Kingdom, is perpetually praised
of his Church.

Verse. 26. Bless ye God in the Congregations] i.e. Catervatim ac turmatim, by
Troops and Companies.

Even the Lord from the fountain of Israel] That is, from the Heart, say some,
which is the true fountain of praising God. Others understand it of Christ, who
is (...) the fountain of Israel, Romans 9.5. there are, that think that the study
of the (...) Tongue is here recommended to us. Reuchlin was wont to say, than
the (...) drank out of Cisterns, the Greeks out of Ponds, but the Hebrews out
of the Fountain it self. Calvin, and the most Interpreters read the words, Ye
that are of the fountain of Israel, springing out of his loins. See Deuteronomy.
33.28. Isa. 48.1. and 51.1.

Verse. 27. There is little Benjamin, with their Ruler] Though before they had
stood out for Saul, and his house, yet now they bore a part in this solemn
celebrity, as being next unto the Sanctuary. Of this Tribe was St. Paul,
Tricubitalis ille homuncio, sed insatiabilis Dei cultor, as Chrysostom calls
him, little in stature, but in labors more abundant. The first precious stone
in the foundation of the New Jerusalem is a Jasper, Rev. 21.19. which in Aarons
breast plate was the last, Exodus 28.20. on which Benjamins name was graven. This
intimates, says one, Ainsw.
the last now to be first, and chief in Christian Churches.

The Princes of Judah, and their Council] Or company, or purple-arrayed ones.
Beza renders it, Lapidatores little, the stoners of the enemies. The word is
found here only: and Forsterus thinks that our Savior alluded to it, when as
Mar. 3. he calls James and John Boanerges.

The Princes of Zebulon] Sic absolvitur pempae triumphalis. These are mentioned
as most remote, bringing up the rear. In those Tribes Christ walked, and
there-hence he called sundry of his Disciples.

Verse. 28. Thy God has commanded thy strength] A brave expression, admired by
Longinus a Heathen Rhetorician. See the like Deuteronomy. 28.8. Psalm. 42.8. and 44.4.
and 33.9. God both made and rules the World without Tool or toil, he enableth
his people to subsist, and to resist their enemies by his Will only, and by the
efficacy of his Word. Suppeditavit tibi Deus tantum robur, nequid superbias,
says Varablus.

Strengthen, O God, that which thou have wrought for us] Petamus ut det, qued
ut habeamus jubet. Pray to the God of all Grace, to make us the same that he
requires us to be.

Verse. 29. Because of thy Temple] Or, out of thy Temple at Jerusalem, q. d.
strengthen us out of thy Temple, out of the fullness that is in thy Son, thereby
typified.

Kings shall bring presents unto thee] See the Note on verse. 22.

Verse. 30. Rebuke the company of Spear-men] Or, Launce-men; Heb. The beast of
the reeds; that is, say some, voluptuous persons that wallow in Wealth, plenty,
Arab. Sicut Pontifices, Cardinales, Episcopi and horum satellites.
and pleasure, Job 40.21. Behemoth lies in the Fennes, which Gul. Parisunsis
applies to the Devil in sensual hearts; Reeds grow not but in fat and moist
places: But they do better, who render it the Rout, or crew of the Cane; that
is, men that bear Reeds or Canes, whereof Spears, Arrows, and Lances were wont
to be made: these men, or rather beasts, cruel, savage, and bloody, rebuke,
that is, repress.

The multitude of the Bulls] The Commanders and Chieftaines.

With the Calves of the people] The common Soldiers.

With pieces of silver] With an Homage-penny, as they call it.

That delight in War] That make a sport of it, as Joab, 2 Samuel 2.14. as Pyrrhus
King of Epirotes, who made a recreation of Warfare. So did not David, though
necessitated thereunto for the glory of God; he was a man of War from his
youth. If we Princes (said our Hen. 7.) should delight in War, or take every
occasion that is offered, the World should never be quiet, but wearied with
continual Wars.

Verse. 31. Princes shall come out of Aegypt] The Gentiles shall one day be
called, and caused Drum veruns cognoscere and colere: even Egypt, that
Arch-enemy of the Church, and Aethiopia, the Offspring of cursed Cham.

And Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God] Heb. Shall make her
hands to run; whereby is noted her speediness in giving, or in receiving the
Gospel: Manibus pedibusque (...) omnia faciat. It is likely that that good
Eunuch, Acts 8. Terent.
preached the Christian verity which himself had embraced, for goodness is
diffusive and Birds, when they come to a full heap of Corn will chirp, Hist.
Aethi^. cap. 137.
and call in for their fellow. The Habassines are still a kind of Christians,
the Nubians have forsaken the Furtherance delivered, and embraced instead of it
partly Mahumetanism, and partly Idolatry: through lack of Ministers, as Alvarro
reports.

Verse. 32. Sing unto God, ye Kingdoms] No such joy as that of the converted,
Isa. 35.10 the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with Song,
and everlasting joy upon their heads, etc. Bernard, for a certain time after
his Conversion, remained as it were deprived of his senses, by the excessive
consolations he had from God. The like befell Cyprian, Austin, and others.

Verse. 33. To him that rides upon the heavens of heavens] i.e. the highest
heaven, Deuteronomy. 10.14.

Which were of old] And do still remain in the same state.

Lo he does send out his voyce] i.e. Thundreth, as Psalm. 29. whenever
therefore we hear it thunder, Sciamus Deum ipsum laqui, hoc est sensibilem
reddi.

Verse. 34. (...) Altitonans.
Ascribe ye strength unto God] The High thunderer; acknowledge your own
nothingness, submit to his government.

His excellency is over Israel, and his strength, etc.] i.e. His glory shines
no less in Israel, than the Thunder roareth in the Clouds.

Verse. 35. O God, thou art terrible out of thine holy places] So the Sanctuary
is called, because divided into three parts; and here hence God was terrible in
his manifestations to his people, and in his operations to his enemies. See
Psalm 67, 2, 3.

Blessed be God] Hereupon says one, God was called in Israel, Baruc-hu, the
Blessed, as Mark 14.61. with Mat. 26.63. See Luke 1.68.

PSALM. LXIX.
A Psalm of David] Quando rebellabat Sheba, says the Syriack, made upon
occasion of Sheba's rebellion presently after Absoloms. Hence he cries out as
one almost overwhelmed,

Verse. 1. Save me O God] Thou who delightest to save such as are forsaken of
their hopes. The Fathers generally take this Psalm to be prophetical touching
the passions of Christ, and his praying then to the Father. David had his
troubles which gave occasion to the penning of this Psalm, but those were all
but as a picture and prelude of Christ's far greater sorrows. Spiritus autem
sanctus manifest se prodit in hoc Psalmo.

For the waters are come in unto my soul] Ever after Noah's flood (that dismal
destruction) great and grievous afflictions were set forth by the rushing in of
waters, and overwhelming therewith. Gods wrath was poured upon Christ as a
mighty torrent of waters, and therefore this expression applied to him has a
special Emphasis; his soul was heavy even to the death. Fluctus fluctum
trudebat, One deep called upon another, etc. O the soul of sufferings which his
soul then suffered!

Verse. 2. I sink in deep mire] Heb. In the mire of depth, or gulf, as Babylon
was afterward called, Isa. 44.27. Here he stuck, and under water, and so must
perish, if he had not present help.

Verse. 3. I am weary of my crying] As a drowning man, whiles he can be heard,
cries for help.

My throat is dryed] Or, parched, raucitate laborant fanc^^.

Mine eyes fail] With much weeping, and long looking. This is a piece of the
curse, Levit. 26.16. Christ became a curse for us, Gal. 3.13.

Verse. 4. They that hate me without a cause, etc.] Christ, besides his inward
fears and griefs caused by the sense of his Fathers wrath for our sins, was set
against and assaulted both by men and Devils (in that three hours darkness
especially) with utmost might and malice.

Then I restered that which I took not away] Quod non rap^i reddebam. D^^^^ was
dealt with as a felon or false-dealer. Christ also was crucified for saying
that he was the Son of God, Job. 19.7. though he held it no robbery to be
equal with God, Phil. 2.6. The Martyrs likewise were laden with many (...)
and false criminations, that they might seem to suffer not as Martyrs, but as
Malefactors.

Verse. 5. O God, thou know my foolishnese] (...). Thou know mine
innocence, and how true I am of (...) f^^ly and those foul faults, wherewith
they falsely (...)

Verse. 6. Let not them be ashamed for my sake] Give me not up to passions of
dishonor, to opprobrious practices, whereby religion might be reproached, or
good people reviled and abused, much less staggered, and set at a stand by my
sufferings.

Verse. 7. Because for thy sake I have born repreach] Whatever mine enemies
pretend, they strike at thee Lord, through my sides; and for thy sake alone it
is that I am so bespattled, that I am even ashamed to look any one in the face.
The most innocent may, upon the fullness of an aspersion, be put out of
countenance.

Verse. 8. I am become a stranger to my Brethren] No otherwise than as if I were
a Ma^zer (so the Hebrews call a Bastard) that is, a strange blet to the family.
Christ came to his own, but they received him not; yea his own brethren
believed not on him, Job. 7. This, when the Turks read in our Gospel, they
wonder, and the Jews therefore slander his miracles, for not so manifest as we
conceive.

Verse. 9. For the zeal of thine house has eaten me up] Non amat qui non
zelat. David's love to God (much less the Lord Christ's) would not suffer him to
bear with Gods dishonor, and the contempt of his ordinances. And this was it
that procured him so much ill will, and such a general alienation from nearest
friends and allies.

And the reproaches of them that reproached thee] Wicked men eftsoons set their
mouths against Heaven, and fall soul upon God himself. This, David (and the son
of David) could not endure, nec aliter amare didicit, as Basit once answered
those that blamed him for appearing so far for his friend, Chrysoft. lib^ 2.
d] sacerdot^
to his own great danger.

Verse. 10. When I went and chastened my soul with fasting] That I might thereby
beat down my body, and tame that rebel flesh of mine,

That was to my reproach] They said I did it in hypocrisy, and design. So they
dealt by the Baptist that crucifix of mortification, Luke 7.33.

Verse. 11. I made sackcloth also my garment] A fashion at solemn fasts among
the Easterlings; as if they thought the coursest clothing too good for them;
and but for shame would have gone stark naked.

I became a proverb to them] Dicterium, They would say with mocking Michal, How
glorious was the King of Israel to day, as one of the vain fellows! 2 Samuel 6.20.

Verse. 12. They that sit in the gate] Men of Authority and Dignity, who should
have showed more grace and gravity. The Saints are sure of enemies of all
sorts. David was traduced at public and private meetings: seriis, and
ludicris, sobriis, and ebriis.

And I was the Song of the Drunkards] Heb. Of the drinkers of strong drink the
Ale-stakes made Ballads on their Ale-bench, de maeie mea and miseria. These
Varlets tear and toss my Name, as Curs do Carrion.

Verse. 13. But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord] So Saint Paul, Being
defamed, says he, we pray. Christ in like case committed himself to God in
well-doing, 1 Pet. 2.

In an acceptable time] Or, there will be an acceptable time.

F^ebile principiums melior fortuna sequeter. Verse. 14. Deliver me out of the
mixe] i. e. De civitate Gehennae, says the Hebrew Scholiast, out of that
deadly danger whereof he had complained, Val. Max. Christ. 41.
verse. 2. Alphonsus King of Arcag^^^ by a gracious condescension helped a laden
Ass out of the mire with his own hand, and is renowned for it in History. God
helps his out full often, and little notice is taken of it.

Verse. 15. Let not the water-floud overflow me] See verse. 1.

(...)] Leave me not helpless, and hopeless.

Vi^ere (...) facias qui moriturus eram. Verse. 16. Hear me, O Lord, for thy
loving kindness is good] It is not like the (...) that lights, but hearteth
not it is like the Summer-Sun, that does both.

Verse. 17. And ^ids not thy face from thy Servant] Who am devoted to thy fear,
and do therefore implore and expect thy favor.

For I am in trouble] And so, a fit object of thy pity.

Verse. 18. Draw nigh unto my soul] Who seem to be afar off: so the flesh
suggesteth when help is any whit deferred.

Because of mine enemies] Who else will excessively insult.

Verse. 19. Thou have known my reproach] That is enough for David, that God
takes Cognizance of the injuries and indignities cast upon him: for he will
surely right him.

Verse. 20. Reproach has broken mine heart, etc.] He knew his own innocence,
and yet it much grieved him to be so defamed; for he knew that a good man
should be as much as might be not only without fault, but without suspicion of
a fault; as August us Caesar was wont to say of his house. Howsoever it is
happy that a true Christian has always his cordial by him, 2 Cor. 1.12. Our
rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, etc.

And I looked for some to take pity] Heb. To lament with me, or to shake the
head over me, as Mourners use to do, to run to my comfort, and to condole with
me. David's friends failed him in this office also. But that was not all,

Verse. 21. They gave me also gall for my meat] Venenum vel sicutam; and so
showed themselves miserable comforters.

And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink] This befell David in Figure,
but Christ in the Letter, Mat. 27.34. It were happy if the Vinegar given him,
might melt our adamantine hearts into godly sorrow.

Verse. 22. Let their table become a snare before them] Let them care their
bane, and drink their poison; whiles all their cates are sauced with the Wrath
of God; Quoniam hoc mod^ cibarunt me, says Kimchi, because they have served me
on this sort. By table, says another Interpreter, we are to understand all
means of comfort and refreshing, both of body and soul, which turn to the ruin
of the wicked, even an odor of death unto death, 2 Cor. 2.15, 16.

And that which should have been, etc.] Tremellius renders it, Pro
retributionibu^^ pro tendicula ipsis, for recompenses, for a trap to them, Romans
11.9. Others, Pacifica in rete! Others again, Et ubi pacem sperant, illic
impingunt, Where they hope for peace, let them fall.

Verse. 23. Let their eyes be darkned] Let them be infatuated, and besotted,
that they may go hoodwinkt to Hell.

And make their loins continually to shake] Ne fugiant, says R. Obadiah Gaon,
that they may not be able to fly, or otherwise to help themselves: for in the
loins and reins of a man lies his strength, Deuteronomy. 33.11. The Syriack has it,
Lumbi eorum sint curvi, viz. under their enemies burdens. See Romans 11.10. bow
down their backs.

Verse. 24. Pour out thine indignation upon them] By Indignation, says Basil,
we are to understand speedy vengeance; by Wrath, durable. This is befaln the
Nation of the Jews to the utmos;t, 1 Thessalonians. 2. or to the end, as some render it.

Verse. 25. Let their habitation be desolate] Heb. Their Palaces, or Castles, so
named of being fair, and high built, in row and order. It is here put not only
for their Habitation, but for their Function. See Acts 1.20.

And let none dwell in their Tents] Lege and (...), says one, speaking of the
mine of Jerusalem by the Romans, Dio in Adrian. (...) Enquir.
under Velpasian, and again (...) all Judea was left almost (...) upon pain of
death to look toward their own Country. At the day (...) be found in Jerusalem
it self an hundred households of Jews. Behold (...) of God of the contempt of
Christ, and his people.

Verse. 26. For they perscute (...) whom (...)] Christ (...) of God, and
afflicted, Isa. 53.4. Him they persecuted to the death, and abused, when he was
at the greatest under, with bitter taunts, and Satan (...) ^^casmes; so the
Pagans, and the Papist dealt (...) the dying; Martyrs and profane persons, and
(...). Dog that worried: and as when a Deer is shot, the (...) of the (...)
their company: so here, Now if it could be said of Mishridates, that (...) such
as maliciously persecuted virtue forsaken of Fortune: much more may we think
does God abhor such cruel Car^i^^s spoken of. See Isa. 47.6. Obad. 1. Zeeh.
1.15.

And they talk to the grief of those whom thou have wounded] Narr^^^ ^^^exu^^
they frame discourses to the grief of thy wounded ones, pouring into their
wound^ not Oil, or Balsome, but vinegar, or salt water. Heb. Th^^ number, or
cip^^ up the grief; that is, says one, they study and devise new way of
torturing them, so that he who would speak of them all, must keep a
remembrance of their number.

Verse. 27. Add iniquity unto their iniquity] Punish one sin with another (by
giving them up to a reprobate sense, to an incureable hardness) and plague them
soundly for their fin. The same Hebrew word signifies both sin and punishment
these two are tied together with chains of Adamant.

And let them not come into thy righteousness] i. e. Hold them not righteous,
nor bestow upon them thy crown of righteousness.

Verse. 28. Let them be blotted out, etc.] Wherein they were never indeed
written among those living in Jerusalem, Isa. 4.3. those firstborn whose names
are written in Heaven, Heb. 12.23. but they accounted themselves of that
number, and were so esteemed by others. This was a mistake, and the Psalmist
prays God to make it appear so, No videantur in alhum tuorum velats quibus
vgra vita (...) destinas^i.

Verse. 29. But I am poer and sorrowful] The Church is usually so, and may sing
as here, Va^nignant, etc. but her comfort is; 1 That Christ says unto her, as
Rev. 2.9. I know thy sorrow and poverty (but that is nothing) Thou art rich. 2
That her poverty is not penal, but Medicinal; Gods dispensation is sit her for
better riches: As a wise Physician purges a foul body till he bring it almost
to skin and bone; But why? That having made it poor there may be a spring of
better blood and spirits.

Verse. 30. I will praise the Name of God] i. e. aquitum Deum. I will thankfully
agnize, and recognize Gods great goodness to me in this deliverance, with mine
uttermost zeal and skill.

Verse. 31. This also shall please the Lord better, etc.] True thankfulness is
epimum and optimum sacrificium those calves of our lips. Hos. 14.3 Heb. 12.1^.
These Calves or Bullocks (as in the Text) must 1 Have burnt and hoofts, be
young and tender, the very best of the best. 2 They must be slain; our thanks
must proceed from a mortified mind. 3 They must be sacrifised; where is
required, 1 An Altar, our praises must be tendered in the mediation of Christ.
2. Fire, our hearts must be enflamed with zeal and ardency. 3 Our hands must be
laid on the head of the Bullock; That is, we must in all humility confess our
unworthiness, etc. This will surely please the Lord better than an Ox, or
Bullock that has ^erns and h^^of^.

Verse. 32. The humble shall see this and be glad] David's great care was for
others confirmation and comfort: much more Christ's, witness that holy prayer of
his, Joh. 17.

Your (...) shall live] Which before was all (...). Pray that yet may joy.
David did so often, Psalm. 6. etc.

Verse. 33. For the Lord he (...) the poor] He is the poor man's King the wronged
man's refuge; Trajan the Emperor is renouned for this, Aeli spart.
that when he was mounted for a battle he alighted again to hear the complaint
of a poor Woman that cried unto him for Justice; and our Edw. 6. for this, that
he would appoint certain hours to sit with the Master of the Requests, Engl.
Elis.
only to dispatch the Causes of the poor. God is much more to be magnified.

Verse. 34. Let the heaven and earth praise him] As they do in their kind: and
have good cause so to do for their ressta^ration by Christ Rom.8.11.

Verse. 35. (...) The Church universal.

And will build the Cities]] The pa^^^d^ at Churches.

That they may dwell there] viz. The seed of his servants, verse. 36.

(...) after them shall be incorporated into the Church, and (...) thing to all
perpetuity.

PSALM. LXX.
A Psalm of David] Made, likely, or rather made use of from Psalm. 40.14, 15,
etc. when Shaba the Son of Bichri was up in rebellion after Absoloms death, 2 Samuel 20.1, etc. See Psalm. 69. title.

To bring to remembrance] Worthy to be remembered, and followed as a pattern of
prayer. Some make this Psalm an Appendix to the former, as Psalm. 43. is to
Psalm. 42. Others make it a part of the next Psalm; which is therefore, say
they, without a title.

Verse. 1. Make haste, O God, to deliver me] As a Father ^ans without legs when
his child is hazarded.

Verse. 2. Let them be ashamed] See Psalm. 40.14. and 35.26, 27.

Verse. 3. Let them be turned back for a reward] Vel ficit per insidias vel
supplantationem, more Athletarum, a (...), Let them be supplanted defeated,

That say, Aha, aha] Augustine renders it, Enge, Enge, that is, Well done; and
gives this Note upon it, Plus persequitur lingua adulator is quam manus
interfectoris; The tongue of a Flatterer may mischief a man more than the hand
of a Murderer. The Apostle, Heb. 11.37. ranketh their tempting and flattering
promises among their bloody deeds, their is sing tongues, with their terrifying
jaws.

Verse. 4. Let all those that seek thee, etc.] Piorum characteres, says one, a
godly, man caracterized, by his search after God, his joy in him, his love to
him, his praises of him.

Let God be magnefied] In illo quicquid ego: ille, non ego, says Augustine.

Verse. 5. But I am poor and needy] See Psalm. 69.29. with the Note.

PSALM. LXXI.
Verse. 1. In thee; O Lord, do I put my trusts] See Psalm. 31.1. with the Note.
It appears by verse. 9.18. that this Psalm was written by David in his old
age, when Absalom, or Sheba was in rebellion against him, though happily for
haste, and in that fright he could not superscribe it as he did the rest. The
Greek title, viz. of David, A Psalm of the Sons of Jonadab, and of them that
were first captived, has no footing in the Original Hebrew.

Verse. 2. Deliver me in thy righteousness] Let my deliverance be the fruit of
thy promise, and of my prayer; and so it will be much the sweeter.

Verse. 3. Thou have given Commandement] sc. To thine Angels, and all other thy
Creatures. or, thou have commanded, that is, thou have promised.

Verse. 4. One of the hand of the unrighteous] That seeks by fraud to
undermine me, and by force to overturn me.

And cruel man] Qui totus in fermento jacet; sour as leaven, sharp as vinegar.

Verse. 5. For thou art my hope] Helpless I may seem, but hopeless I am not.

Verse. 6. H^ thee have I been bolden us from the womb As in the Womb I lived
upon thee, so from the womb. The same that breed thus, feeds us, that matter
that nourishes the Child in the Womb, striking up into the breasts, and by a
further concoction becoming white is mode milk for it.

Thou ar^ (...) me out infamy to other bowels] Else I had never been born
alive. That a child is bound. (...) says Galen, Sed quomoda fiat, admotoritar
(...) calls it, (...) supra mirabilo^ muja mirabila the greatest wonder in
the World. Surely, if a Child were born but once in an hundred years space, we
should all then to see so strange a work says another.

Verse. 7. I am as a wonder (...)] Or, (...) the great ones a Monster to the
mighty, Quia credo (...) glosseth, because I believe what I yet see not, viz.
that this storm shall blow over [and I he re^^^ed in my Throne.

Verse. 8. (...).

Verse. 9. Cast me not off in the time of old age] For now I have most need of
thee. The white Rose is soonest cankered, so is the white Head soonest
corrupted.

Saepe nigrum cor est, capue albium -- Satan makes a prey of old Solomon, Asa,
Lot, others; whom when young, he could never so deceive. The Heathens
therefore well warn us to look well to our old age, as that which comes not
alone, but is infested with many diseases both of body and mind. This David
knew, and therefore prayed, as here, Cast me not off in the time of old age,
for sake me not when my strength fails. He is a rare old man that can say
with Caleb, Josh. 14.10, 11. Omnia fert at^^, animum quoque.

Verse. 10. For mine enemies.] Who, rather than their lives, would bereave me of
mine; these would double murder me, first by detraction, and then by deadly
practice.

Verse. 11. God has forsaken him] For his late fin against Vriah; and as may
appear by his present distress, his forlorn proscribed condition.

Verse. 12. O God, be not far from me] The insolency of his enemies sets an
edge upon his prayers; Oration sine malis est avis sine alis. Our Savior in his
Agony prayed the more earnestly, Luke 22.44.

Verse. 13. Let them be confounded and consumed.] Here he begins, Diris
devovere, to devote his foes to destruction, who soon also found that these
were not bruta fulmina, as the Popes Bulls are (wittily compared by one to a
fools Dagger, rattling and snapping without an edge) but that there was an
energy in them, though happily not felt for present: and that they had better
have angered all the Witches in the Country than occasioned David thus to curse
them in the Name of the Lord.

Verse. 14. But I will hope continually] I will lengthen out mine hope, as a
line drawn out. Tremellius renders it, I am in expectation still of completing
thy praise, and will go on therein, viz. when thou shall have completed my
deliverance.

Verse. 15. My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation] Lo
here a sweet and comfortable conjunction of Gods Righteousness, and our
Salvation. See 2 Thessalonians. 1.6, 7.

For I know not the numbers thereof] Or, Though I know not, etc. by a modest
correction, since they may be celebrated, but not enumerated.

Littera quot conchas, quot amaena rosaria flores,
Quotve soporiferum grana papaver habet:
Sylva feras quot alit, quot piscibus unda natatur,
Et teneram pennis era pulfat avis.
So many, and ten thousand times more are Gods loving kindnesses. The Psalmist
elsewhere venteth himself by an Exclamation, Psalm. 31.19. See the Note there.

Verse. 16. I will go in the strength of the Lord God] Ingrediar in potentias
Domini, I will do what I can, with Gods help, in glorifying his Name, though I
cannot do as I would, and as I ought: Narrabo res inenarrabilos and then
entreat those that hear me to think higher things of God than I am able to
utter.

Evan of thine only] For that is enough, and more than I can well do; I will
not once mention (as profane persons use to do) mine own Wisdom, valor, etc.
alas, they are not worthy to be named in the same day with thine.

Verse. 17. O God, thou have taught me] Happy David in such a Schoolmaster. All
the faithful are taught of God; outwardly by his Word and Works, inwardly by
his Spirit; Et quando Christ^^ ^^^gister quam cite discitur quod decetur? Aug.
Ambros.
Nescit tarda molimina Spiritus sancti gratia.

Verse. 18. N^^ also what I am (...) and rray-headed] Now, that the Plumb-tree
is full of bloomes, the map of age is figured in my sore-head, the calendar of
death appears in the furrows of my face: let me do nothing to spot my white
head. Let me with the S^n give greatest glimpse at the going down, and with the
Rose (...), though I have lost my color, See verse. 9.

And thy power to every one that is to come] Mirus fervor David is in
celebranda bonitate Dei, says Vatablus here. David would propagate Gods praise
to all posterity.

Verse. 19. Thy righteousuess also, O God, is very bigh.] Far above the reach
of human reason; yet for the strengthening of my hope, I will look up after it,
though mine eye should be tired in the way.

Verse. 20. Thou which bast showed me great and sore troubles] Augustias magnas
and malas, and have thereby taught me, verse. 17, Quae nocent, docent.

Shall quicken me again] And this is one singular height of thy righteousness,
that thou carryest thy people thorough so many deaths; and causest them to
ascend from the lowest ebb of affliction, to the highest pitch of comfort.
Stoics ascribe such Occurrences to Fate, Epicures to Fortune, but David to God
alone.

Verse. 21. Thou shall increase my greatness] Meam, id est Tuam, quam mihi
dedisti, says the Arabic gloss here; My greatness, that is, thy greatness
which thou have given me.

Verse. 22. I will also praise thee with the Psaltery] In Organo natali, with an
instrument made like a bottle.

O thou holy one of Israel] Who sanctifiest thine throughout, and art to be
sanctified of thine throughout all eternity, Isa. 5.16.

Verse. 23. And my soul which thou have redeemed] Heart and lips shall concur in
this work. The voice which is made in the mouth, is nothing so sweet as that
which comes from the depth of the breast. The deeper and hollower the belly of
the Lute, or Viol is, the pleasanter is the sound: the fleeter, the more
grating and harsh in our ears.

Verse. 24. My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness] Advisedly talk, and
upon due deliberation. What a mad Edict was that of Henry the second of France,
that men should not talk at all of Scripture-matters? And that of the Jesuits
at Dola, forbidding any talk of God, either in good sort, or in bad?

PSALM. LXXII.
A Psalm for Salomon] Whom his Father David had crowned whilst yet alive; and
now, at point of death, leaves him this his last bequeath as a Basilicondoron,
a direction in point of Government, and a prediction of a most flourishing
reign thereupon; This last he so describes, that by a spirit of Prophecy,
attributing eternity thereunto, he rises up from Solomon to Christ, of whom
he was a type; like as also the Promise made to David concerning Solomon and
Christ, was conceived in such terms by God himself, as if they had been almost
one and the same person, 2 Samuel 7.13, 14. 1 Chronicles. 22.10.

Verse. 1. Give the King thy Judgments, O God] i. e. Give me for that little
time I have here to live, and reign, skill and will to do it aright, and as thy
Law requires.

And thy righteousness unto the Kings Son] To Solomon, and his Successors; for
David's great care was the welfare of Gods people after his decease, for which
end he both prays, and principleth his Son Solomon; and herein his great
piety to the end appears. I could not but love the man (said Theodosius the
Emperor concerning Ambrose) who, as whiles he lived, he heartily wished that
the contentions that were in the Church might be quenched, though it were with
his blood; so when he dyed, he was more sollicitous of the Churches welfare
than of his own.

Verse. 2. He shall judge thy people with righteousness] sc. If thou please to
remember thy promise to me, and to answer this my prayer of faith founded
thereupon.

And thy poor] Or, thine afflicted. The people (the poor afflicted especially)
are the Lords; and therefore not to be tyrannized over, and trampled on by
their Governors.

Verse. 3. The mountain shall bring peace] i. e. They shall not be so pestered
and infested by Thieves and Robbers, who usually (...) and hide themeselves in
hills and hollow places.

By righteousness]. By right administration of Justice, as it was here in King
Alfreds days, who ordained that his (...) should be divided into T^^s. or
Tythings, every of which severally should give Bond for the good abearing of
each other; and he who was of that (...) behavior, that he could (...) be
admitted to these Tythings, was forth which conveyed to the House of Correction.
The ancientest of these men were called by a specialty the Tything men.

Verse. 4. He shall judge the (...) of the people.] Indeed all, indifferently,
without respect of persons; but a poor man's Tale shall be heard and his Cause
judged, as well as a rich man's. Under Christ's Government it shall be so
howsoever; I know thy poverty, but thou art rich, says he. Rev. 3.9. Amongst
men both in sures of Love, and of Law, Money makes Mystery Not so here.

And shall break in pieces the oppressour] The Sycey^^nt, says the Creek; the
Slanderer, says the Latin; the Devil, say some. Over these He shall, turn the
wheel.

Verse. 5. They shall fear this] Who have blessed them with so good a King; such
as makes it his main care to set up God, wherever he has to do.

As long as the Sun and Moon (...)] The Lacedonians publicly professed, Quoad
sol codem it itenire maebit, quo (...) meet, (...) sociat cum Xerxe (...),
whiles the Sun shall hold on his course, we will never make a League with
Xerxes.

Verse. 6. He shall come down like rain upon the (...) grass] That is, he shall
be very dear to us, and much delighted in. See Job 29.23. with the Note.

As showers that water the earth] This is chiefly fulfilled in Christ, who by
raining down righteousness, makes his Church to grow and flourish.

Verse. 7. In his days shall the righteous flourish] As watered Gardens, Jar.
31.12. or as the Willows by the water courses. Isa. 44.4. (...)

And abundance of peace] The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the
effect of righteousness quietness, and affurance for ever, Isa. 32.17. Christ's
subjects have peace, (...) Isa. 25.3 a multiplied peace, a multiplied pardon,
Isa. 55.7. where sin abounds, grace superaboundeth; neither can they commit
more than God will remit unto them.

Verse. 8. He shall have dominion also from Sea to Sea] Solomon shall from the
Mediterranean in the West, to the Persian Sea or Indian Ocean in the East.

And from the river unto the ends of the earth] i.e. From Euphrates, and the
Northern Countries, to Egypt, and the utmost pares of all Africa. This was a
Type of Christ's universal dominion thoroughout the whole World, Zech. 9.9.
Psalm. 110.1.

Verse. 9. They that dwell in the Wildereness] Wild, Barbarous, rude people;
such as were the ancient Britains our Progenitors, till Christ the Sun of
righteousness shone upon them till they were brought to the obedience of faith:
Bond in Hors^.
Tun^ enim sensin^ evannit ferit as, indias ezulavit immanit as, corruit
crudelites, etc. for then it was otherwise.

And his enemies shad lick the dust] A Ceremony much in use among the
Easterlings, Prostrani adorant hi^rationem^ says Herodotus of the Persians;
Lib. 1.
they worship their betters, by falling to the ground before them: and how
Tridetes King of Parthians worshipped Nero. is to be read in Die Cassius.
Christ's foes shall all be made his footstool.

Verse. 10. The Kings of Tarshish, and of the Isles] i.e. All the Kings of the
earth, which being encompassed with the Ocean, is therefore by the old
Geographers called, a great Island. Judes, though part of the Con^i^^^at, is
called, an Isle, Isa. 20.6. because separated from other Countries: with whom
God would have his people to have as little to do as might be that they might
not be corrupted with foreign fashion. This was a (...) in Solomon See 1 King.

complained of Solomon (...), and (...) yoke (...) as by thy Father, it was but
of a sinful (...), says (...) people (...) know when they are well, but
quarrelling at, and complaining of the present Government; you even (...)

Verse. 13. He shall spare the poor an (...)] Hereby David shows his Son and
all his Successors, Qua^^ debent (...), what manner of man a King ought to be.
Regiment without Righteousness turns into tyranny: it is but Robbery with
authority. O. Scipio Nastra, for his good Government was ^^^med Optimus by the
Senate, and had an house gived him at the P^^lick charge; in (...) saira, that
the poor might repair to him.

Verse. 14. He shall redeem their soul from decent and violence] Those two noted
Engines of all mischief to the poor, viz. privy deceit (Ufury, the Septuagint
and Vulgar render it) and open violence, (...) fraud and force, craft and
cruelty.

And precious shall their blood be in his sight] He shall be very tender of
their lives, that they be not causelessly cast away; either in times of Peace
or War. Precious also in the sight of the Lord Christ, is the death of his
(...), his Martyrs, Psalm. 116 15.

Verse. 15. And he shall live] The King shall, according to the poor man's prayer

Sheon, or (...) the happy. Whereupon

Verse. 16. There shall be an handful of Corn, ^amp;c.] (...) The batr^^
mountain shall yield Corn abundantly, and also by handfuls: as (...) in those
seven years of plenty, Genesis 41.47.

The fruit thereof shall (...)] The Corn shall (...) and (...), like the Trees

And they of the city shall flourish] Men also increase and multiply. Jerem.
31.27. to a very great number, as piles of Grass Christ's subjects shall.

Verse. 17. (...) for ever] i. e. His Kingdom, for it shall not be nomen inane.
Other Kingdoms have their times, and their turns, their rise, and their ruins;
not so Christ's, and this is great comfort.

His name shall be continued] Fil^^^^ nomini (...) it shall be begotten as one
Generation is begotten of another. Heb. His name shall be childed; that is, so
continued as Families are continued; there shall be a constant succession of
Christ's Name to the end of the World there will still be Christians who are his
Children. Heb. 2.13, 14. The old Hebrews tell us, that J^nn^n (the Hebrew word
^ere used) is one of Christ's Names:

And men shall be blessed in him] Or, they shall bless themselves in him, viz.
in Solomon, but especially in Christ of whom Solomon was but a shadow.

All Nations shall call him blessed] If all Generations shall call the Mother
of Christ blessed, Luke 3.48. how much were Christ himself:

Verse. Sunt verba leribae, ut hodit, Aben-Ezra, ex R. Jehudah.
18. Blessed be the Lord God] (...), these are the words of the Psalmist say
the Rabines, blessing God, who had given Le^^gneph church, strength to him

rather praising God for all the (...) the Lord Christ.

Verse. 19. And blessed (...); so unsatisfiable, and unweareable are the (...) a

Verse. 20. The Prayer (...)

PSALM. LXXIII.
A Psalm of Asaph] Who was not only an excellent Musician, but a Prophet also,
an Orator, and a Poet; not unlike (for his style) to Horace, or Persius, This,
and the ten next Psalms, that bear this name in the front, consist of
complaints for most part, and sad matters.

Verse. 1. Truly God is good to Israel] Or, Yet God is, etc. Thus the Psalmist
begins abruptly after a sore Conflict; throwing off the Devil, and his fiery
Darts, wherewith his heart for a while had been wounded. It is best to break
off temptations of corrupt and carnal reasonings, and to silence doubts and
disputes, lest we be foiled. He shoots (says Greenham) with Satan in his own
bow, who thinks by disputing and reasoning to put him off.

To such as are of a clean heart] Such as are Israelites indeed, and not
Hypocrites and dissemblers. For as for such as turn a side unto their crooked
ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity (as
malefactors are led forth to execution) but Peace shall be upon Israel, Psalm.
125.5. upon the Israel of God, Gal. 6.16.

Verse. 2. But as for me my feet were almost gone] i. e. I was wel-night
brought to believe, that there was no divine providence: as the Athenians did,
when their good General Nicias was worsted and slain in Sicily; as Pompey did,
Thucid.
when having the better cause, he was overcome by Caesar; as Brutus did (that
last of the Romans as he was called for his courage) when beaten out of the
field by Anthony, he cried out (...), Now I see that virtue is nothing, but all
things are moderated by Fortun, whom he charged his children therefore to
worship, as a goddess of greatest power.

My steps had wel^nigh slipt] Quasi nihil effusi, sunt gressus mei, that is, as
Kimchi interprets it, Status meus crat tantillus quasi nullus esset pre
figendo peds locus, I had scarce any fastening for my feet, my heels were gone
almost. What wonder then that Heathens have been stounded and staggered?

Cum rapiaent mala fata bonos (ignoscite fasso)
Solicitor nullos esse putare Deos.
Says Ovid. And to the fame purpose another Poet.

Marmoreo Licinies tumulo jacet, and Cato parve,
Pompeius nullo; quis putet esse Deos?
Verse. 3. For I was envious at the foolish] Heb. At the Bragadochies, the
vainglorious, the mad-boasters; I aemulated, and stomached their prosperity,
Jact abundis
compared with mine own far-worse condition. Godly men though cured of their
spiritual phrenzy, yet play often many mad tricks; one while fretting at the
prosperity of their adversaries, and another while murmuring at their own
afflictions, or plotting courses how to conform themselves to the World, etc.

When I saw the prosperity of the Wicked] This has ever been a pearl in the
eyes, not of the Heathens only, but of better meu. See Jer. 12.1, 2, Habbak.
1.3. Psalm. 37. etc. Yet Seneca writes a treatise of it, and shows the
reasons, if at least he believed himself therein. Erasmus passes this censure
of him; Read him as a Pagan, and he writes Christian-like,; read him as 2
Christian, and he writes Pagan-like.

Verse. 4. For there are no bands in their death] Or, No knots and knorles; they
dye without long sickness, or much pain, or trouble of mind. If a man dye ^ike
a Lamb, and pass out of the World like a bird in a shel, he is certainly saved,
think some. The wicked are here said to dye quietly, as if there were no
loosening of the band that is betwixt soul and body. Julian the Apostate dyed
with these words in his mouth; Vitam reposcents natura tanquam debtor bonae
fidei redditurum exulto, Anomian
that is, I owe a death to Nature, and now that she calls for it, as a
faithful debtour, c^^t. lib. 7. (...) Diodor.
I gladly pay it. The Princes of the Sogdians, when they were drawn forth to
death by Alexander the great, carmen more latumtium etcinerut, tripu^isque
gaudium animi ostentare caperunt, They sang and danced to the place of
execution.

But their strength is firm] They are lively and lusty, they are pingues and
praevalidi, fat and fair-liking, fat is their fortitude, so some render it;
Others, strong is their porch or Palace.

Verse. 5. They are not in trouble as other men] But live in a serene clime,
under a perpetual calm; as he did of whom it is storied, that he never had any
cross, but at last was nailed to a cross, Polycrates I mean, King of Egypt.
Marull^^ tells us, that Ambrose coming once to a great man's house, who
boasted that he had never suffered any adversity, Marul. l. 5. c. 3.
he hasted away thence, and said he did so, we una cum ^omine perpetuis
prosperitatibus uso periret, lest he should perish with the man, that bad been
so extraordinarily prosperous. And no sooner was he and his company departed,
but the earth opened and swallowed up that man's house, with all that were in it.

Verse. 6. Therefore pride compasses them about as a chain] The pride of their
hearts breaks forth in their costly habits, whiles they are torquati, and
auro ac gemmis amicti, setting up their plumes as Peacocks, which have their
names in Hebrew from the joy they take in their fair feathers; so do these
glory in their pride, and are puffed up with a foolish persuasion of their own
prudence. Vermis divitiarum est superbia. Charge the rich that they be not
high-minded, 1 Timothy 6.17. He is a great rich man, says Austin, and greater
than his riches, who does not therefore think himself great, because he is
rich. Magna cognatio, says Another, Ut rei sic nominis, divitiis and vitiis,
He is a rare rich man that is not the worse for his wealth. The Palm Tree, they
say, will not grow in a fat ground, but salt and ashes must, in that case, be
cast at the root, to qualify the strength of the soil: So grace will not grow
in a fat heart, without the salt of mortification, and ashes of humiliation.
Their heart is fat as grease, but I delight in thy law.

Violence covers them as a garment] Violence, Psalm. 119.70.
or wrong-dealing is the perpetual companion of pride, and covers them a^ a
garment, finely fitted to their bodies, as was the Harlots habit, Prove. 7.10.
Aben-Ezra renders it, obruit eos, overwhelmeth them; that is, domineereth over
them. Some Rabbines render it, Nates eorum violentia tegit.

Verse. 7. Their eyes stand out with fatness] The Chaldee has it, The
similitude of their face is changed through fatness. See Job 15.27. The Greek,
For the wealth which they have, their eyes are lifted up. The Latin, Their
iniquity proceeds as it were from fatness.

They have more than heart could wish] Heb. They pass the thoughts of the
heart; Which the Greek renders, See Jer. 5.28.
No man can think how wicked they are; those stall-fed Sodomites for instance.
So Aben-Ezra, Transgressiones perpetrant quas cogitare nefas est, they are more
wicked than can be imagined; Others they covet beyond measure, and are
insatiable, thinking to enclose the whole World in their net, as Timothy the
Athenian did Cities and Towns in his toils. Our translation is not to be
disliked; Plut. in Sylla:
neither yet are all to be accounted wicked, that have more than heart could
wish. De Civ. Dei l. 5. c. 25.
Bonus Deus Constantinum magnum tantis torrenis implevit muneribus, quanta opt
are nullus anderet. says Augustine.

Verse. 8. They are corrupt and speak wickedly] Their pride before taxed, verse.
6. buddeth, and budgeth, Ezekiel. 7.10. like a foul swelling in the body, it
breaks out into sores of all sorts, odious words and deeds, abominable to God
and man. Diff^uunt and loquuntur in malitia rapinam, They melt and are spilt in
sensual delights and dissolute practices. Or, they let loose themselves, and
keep not within compass. Or, they fly-blow and make to stink the good names of
others, sc. while they speak evil of them, and reproach them. Tabifici sunt,
so Tremellius renders it.

They speak loftily] De celsuudine, from aloft; tapides loquuntur, they
threaten thunder bolts, Dionys. commisso sacrilegio Deum dicebat sacrilegi^
bonam navigationem* concedere. Act. and Mon. fol. 1417. Turk. hist. 423.568.
throw daggers, fastuosa voce omnes territant.

Verse. 9. They set their mouth against the Heavens] They houl upward, as
Woolves; bark at the Moon, as dogs piss against the Sun, belch out blasphemies
against God, as did Pharaoh, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, Dionysius the tyrant,
Antiochus, Antichrist, Rev. 13.6. (Pope Julius the third for instance, who
would have his pork-meat (forbidden him by his Physicians) at despi^^ di Dio)
The great Turk at the ^^ge of Sc^dra, and again at the Rhodes; besides Hack^^
in Queen Elizabeth's time, and the Ranters in ours.

And their tongue walks thorough the earth] Snapping at every one they meet,
like a mad dog; and not sparing to speak, or rather to spue out whatsoever
lies uppermost. Thou shall not walk up and down as a slanderer, or Peddler with
his pack, which he opens eftsoons, and disperseth his wares, Levit. 19.16.
That Is a true saying of Seneca, Ut quisque est dissolutissimae vitae, ita est
sollutissimae lingua. As any one is more dissolute in his life, so he is more
heedlesse of his speeches.

Verse. 10. Therefore his people return hither] i.e. Some good men are as wise
(or rather as foolish) as I have been, to mis-censure on this manner, and to
repent me of my repentance, or to say, as verse. 11.

How does God know, etc? because Waters of a full cup are wrung out unto them]
That is, because the wicked drink wine in bowls, their servants wringing the
rich ripe grapes thereinto, as Genesis 40.11. Or, because God sends them, (his
people) perpetual and extreme afflictions, which is meant, say some, by
drinking off a cup, and squeezing all the liquor into it. Others read it, Full
Waters are wrung out to them, that is, say they, these their thoughts and
speeches savouring of infidelity, shall cost them abundance of tears; as Peter's
fall did him.

Verse. 11. And they say, how does God know?] Even the godly through infirmity,
are drawn sometimes to doubt of Gods providence and government, because of the
inequality of events in human affairs. It had like to have cost the Psalmist
here a fall, and made him almost cast of all care off Religion. Basil also was
in some doubt of the divine providence; under the heat of the Arian
persecution. For has the Lord utterly forsaken his Churches, says he? is it
now the last hour? In the next age Salvian (for the satisfaction of some good
people) was forced to write eight books, De gubernatione Dei, and de justa
praesentique ejus Judicio, of Gods governing the World, and the righteousness
of his proceedings. Upon a like occasion Austin wrote those twenty two most
excellent and elaborate books, De civitate Dei.

Verse. 12. Behold those are the ungodly] q.d. If God do take knowledge of
things here below, and orders all events, how it is that the ungodly prosper,
whilst better men suffer?

Who prosper in the World] An ill character, every thing considered. See Psalm.
17.14. with the Note. Behold these are the ungodly, the fortunate men of the
World, so some render it. He that lives in the height of the Worlds
blandishments, is not far from destruction. Periculosa est sum bona corporis
valetudo, says Hippocrates. The height of health is nearest to sickness and
death.

They increase in riches] They wallow in wealth; God pouring honey into their
hives; but for a vengeance.

Verse. 13. Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain] For all is to little
purpose, if the cards play on this fashion, if the good must be thus extremely
under, and the bad a top of the wheel. Surely I have troubled my self to no
purpose or profit; If it be so, why am I thus? as she said. I read of a
profane soldier, who at the siege of a Town, passing a place of danger, was
heard swearing, and when one that stood by warned him, saying, Fellow-souldier,
do not swear, the bullets fly, he answered, They that swear come off as well
as those that pray; But soon after this, a shot hit him, and down he fell. It
is not safe for Saints to symbolize with sinners in such desperate speeches;
lest the Lord hear it and be displeased.

Omne trahit se cum numinis ira malum. Ovid.
Verse. 14. For all the day long have I been plagued] Gods best beloved are most
afflicted, neither have any out of hell ever suffered more than the heirs of
heaven. See my treatise called Gods love tokens.

And chastened every morning] Singulis matutinis, I am no sooner awake than
some new misery seizes me, quasi egisset excubias, as if it had laid wait for
me.

Verse. 15. If I say I will speak thus] If I should give way to such a wicked
thought, etc. Here the Spirit begins to get the upper hand, to gain the wind
and the hill of the flesh. The Spirit would always get the better of the
flesh, were it upon equal terms. But when the Flesh shall get the hill, as it
were of temptation, and shall have wind to drive the smoke upon the face and
eyes of the Combatant, that is, to blind him, upon such a disadvantage he may
seem to be overcome.

Behold I shall offend against the generation, etc.] As if they were no
children, because so sharply chastened; whereas the Saints are unto God as the
apple of his eye, that little man in the eye, as the word signifies. The eye
is a tender part; yet when dim and dusky we apply sharp powders, or waters to
it, to eat out the web, pearl or blindness, and yet love it never the less. No
more does God his Children, though he apply corrosives or causticks to their
flesh, if need require.

Verse. 16. When I thought to know this, it was too painful for mee] Heb. It
was labor in mine eyes, labor in vain, I could do no good on it, sed
labyrinthis and Maeandris inextricabilibus implicabar, I did but tread a Maze,
for Gods Judgments are unsearchable, and his ways (of providence) are past
finding out; they are far above the reach of human reason.

Verse. 17. Until I went into the Sanctuary of God] And there consulted with
the Scriptures, heard the lectures of the law, prayed, went thorough all the
exercises of Gods School.

Then understood I their end] To be such as God pronounces of them in the
Scriptures, and as the effect and common experience sometimes declares. For
some wicked God punishes here, In Psalm. 36.
lest his providence, but not all, lest his patience and promise of Judgment
should be called into question, says Austin.

Verse. 18. Surely thou did set them in slippery places] Where they can have
no more certainty than if they went upon the smoothest Ice, or walked upon a
mine of gunpowder. The Turks seeing so few of their Visiers to dye in their
beds, have taken up this proverb, He that is even in the greatest office, is
but a statue of glass.

Thou castedst them down into destruction] Improbos ex magna prosperitate
tanquam ex Tarpeia rupe in barathrum perditionis praecipitasti. Haman for
instance.

Verse. 19. How are they brought into desolation, etc?] Such as the Psalmist
expresses by an exclamation, caused by an admiration at Gods dreadful
Judgments which his faith beheld as present and unavoidable, and such as
astonished the beholders. See it in the literal and mystical Babylon, Jer.
51.37, 41. Rev. 18.10, 17.

They are utterly consumed with terrours] Heb. They are ended, they are
consumed with troublesome frights; especially when from their deathbeds they
behold that threefold terrible spectacle, Death, Judgment, Hell, and all to
be passed thorough by their poor souls.

Verse. 20. As a dream when one awaketh] Such is the wicked man's pomp and
bravery; now what are dreams but pleasant follies and delusions, the empty
bubbles of the mind, Children and tales of fancy, idle and fruitless notions,
mere bawbles? Sic Mycillus apud Lucian.
See Isa. 29.7, 8. The Fisherman in Theocritus dreamt that he was some
demy-god; but when he awaked, all his golden hopes vanished. The Chaldee
explaineth it, As the dream of a drunken man; who sleeping on the steep of a
rock may think himself a King; and starting for joy may soon break his neck at
the bottom.

So, O Lord, when thou awakest thou shall despise their image] That is, that
whereof they dreamt, and whereon they do still dote; viz. their worldly pomp
and pride, which is nothing else but magnum nihil, a glorious fancy, a
nonentity. Some read it thus, When thou shall raise up (the dead) thou shall
despise their image, that is, their souls; they shall rise to everlasting shame
and contempt, Dan. 12.2.

Verse. 21. Thus my heart was grieved] Heb. Leavened and soured, sc. with the
greatness of godly sorrow, and quasi aceto acri perfundebatur, it was steeped
as it were in Vinegar. So Peter wept bitterly; waters of Marah flowed from his
eyes.

And I was pricked in my reins] Pricked at heart, as those, Act. 2. put to as
much pain as those that have the stone in the kidneyes, exceedingly grieved for
my mis-construing and mis-censuring of Gods ways and people.

Verse. 22. So foolish was I and ignorant] By this be-fooling and be-beasting
himself, he retracteth and bewaileth his former fluctuation and folly, verse.
2, 3. This is the proper fruit of his godly sorrow, verse 21.

I was as a beast before thee] Heb. Behemoth, as a great beast, or as many
beasts in one. Thus he aggravateth, and lays load upon his sin, and so must
we.

Verse. 23. Nevertheless, I am continually with thee] Or, yet I was always with
thee, sc. when at worst. Infirmities discard us not. The Marriage knot is not
dissolved by every falling out; not the League betwixt Princes broken by the
wrongs done by Pirates.

Thou have holden me by my right hand] That I should not utterly fall from
thee: there was still a supporting grace. Quando (...) men's vacil^^ba^
Aben-Ezra.


Verse. 24. Thou shall guide me with thy counsel] We had his repentance, verse.
21, 22. his faith, 23. and here; we have (...) hope of safety here, and
salvation hereafter.

And afterward receive me] As thou did holy Henoch.

Verse. 25. Whom have I in heaven but thee] I would I were in heaven with thee,
so Aben-Ezra renders it; and to the same sense Beza paraphraseth, Apage terra,
quod utinam Deus in calo jam and tecum essem: quid enim est in terra quod me
vel tantillum vetineat?

Verse. 26. My flesh fails, and my heart faileth] Some think that the
Psalmist, through egression of affection unto God, having spent and exhaled his
spirits, fell into a swoon; out of which he recovered again by the joy of the
Lord, which was his strength, even the rock of his heart. The Greek says, The
God of my heart.

Verse. 27. For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish] How can they do
otherwise, when as Salvation is far from them? Psalm. 119.155. And upon this
ground it is, that I do so earnestly desire to be with thee; since

Thou have destroyed (or shut up from punishment) all them that go a whoring
from thee] Having their hearts full of Harlotry, as appears by their courting
the Creature.

Verse. 28. But it is good for me to draw nigh to God] To hang ever upon thee
(in this general defection of others) by the faith of the Gospel, Heb. 7.19. by
putting my trust in thee, that I may declare all thy works, and relate my
experiments; A circle is the perfectest figure, because it begins and
ends; the last point meets in the first from whence it came. We shall never
come to perfection or satisfaction, till we draw nigh to God, till God make the
circle meet, etc.

PSALM. LXXIV.
A Psalm of Asaph] Concerning the Babylonish Captivity, says Kimchi; which
either was here foretold by David's Asaph, or bewailed by another of that name,
who lived at that very time, when the Jews groaned under those grievous
calamities.

Verse. 1. O God, why have thou cast us off for ever?] The greatness of their
grief, and diuturnity of their misery draw from them such expressions of
discontent, as if they were doubtful of an utter dereliction.

Why does thine anger (or thy nose) smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?]
Anger is a fire, and in men or other Creatures enraged, a smoke forms to go
out of their Nostrils. Xenoph^n says of the ^he^^ns, when they are angry, they
breath fire. This then is spoken of God, after the manner of men.

Verse. 2. Remember thy Congregation which thou have purchased] His complaints
end not in murmuring and grunting against God, but in humble Petitions so
intermingled with sighs and groans, as that his speech is not so plain and
perfect as at other times. Th^^ which he mainly (...) i^ the (...), that (...)
of heavenly Honey, as one calls it.

The rod of thine inheritance] Inheritances were (...) to be (...) out by Rods
and (...)

(...) Metaphor from combatants, Qui (...) pedes and pass^^, ut violenti^^ in
host^m invehantur. Some have reward (...) thereby the Temple, that place (...),
Ezekiel. 43.

(...) whither he (...) for safety.

Verse. 4. (...) Posuerunt sign^ sua, signa. Kimchi. R. Solom.
are so called by a word (...)

They set up their (...) for signs] They set them up upon the very Temple (as
if they had conquered God himself) those their Trophies and Monuments of
victory. Some refer us for the sense of these Words to Ezekiel. 21.2^ others
render them thus, They have (...) in their, (...) (or (...) the sacred) signs,
and to have pointed there holy places. Besides, what Antioch^^ did (concerning
which see the Books of Maccab^^s, and (...)) in after times, the Arms of Rome
were set upon the Temple, and a Sw^^^ (...) ^^^ven over the gate: this was the
abomination of desolation foretold by our Savior, Mat. ^4* 15.

Verse. 5. Aman was (...) according it, etc.] i. e. Time was when the Workmen
got them a name, by cutting down and fitting the Timber, for this building the
Temple, renowned throughout the whole World for costly and choice materials,
for curious and exact Workmanship, for Spiritual employment, and for mystical
signification; never was there the like edifice.

Verse. 6. But now they break down the carved work (...)] The Chaldeans did with
Military violence, and afterward the Romans under Titus, who could not
preserve it from the Soldiers fury, though he desired so to have done, as
(...) Historians have told us. Now, if the enemies rage were so great (as is
here described) against the outward marks of Religion, how much more should our
zeal kindle against the most costly or curious Monuments of Idolatry and
Superstition? Zisca the valiant B^he^ine overthrew three children Monasteries
with their Mawmets, and among the rest the famous Monastery called the Kings
Court, a mile from Prague, in the walls whereof the whole Bible was most
exquisitely written in Letters of gold.

Verse. 7. They have cast fire into thy Sanctuary] Heb. They have sent thy
Sanctuary into the fire. So the French Papists, under the conduct of the
Guises, dealt by the public Meeting Houses of the Protestants there, and
particularly, by that Church at ^ions, which was called (...). Hoc apud
Ethnic^^ (...) horrendum, Herodot. in V^an.
The Heathens observed of such as destroyed Temples, that they commonly came to
some fearful end, by Thunderbolts, or otherwise.

Verse. 8. Let us destroy them together] Them, that is, the Saints; let us prey
upon them as Hawks do upon Doves; or them, that is the Temples and Schools;
these the Devil ever sought to destroy, as contary to his Kingdom; and so (...)
still by the Turks and Papists, and other Heretics.

They have burnt up all the Synagogues] The^e were a kind of Chapels of ease to
the Temple at Jerusalem, and in these the people met frequently, on the Sabbath
especially, for holy Exercises, as we do in our Churches. The good Centurion
built one of these, Luke 7.5. See Jam. 2.2.

Verse. 9. We see not our signes] Those testimonies of Gods special (...) the
public Ordinances, together with the legal Ceremonies, which was then Christ
in Figures, q. d. (...).

There is (...) any Prophet, etc.] Hence some conclude, that this Psalm was
written about the end of the Babylonish Captivity, when there was Cha^^^^^th
(...), (...) up of Prophecy, as (...) so that they had Prophets (...)

Verse. 11. Why withdrawest thou thy hand?] Some by hand understand the left
hand, and so both hands are withdrawn, yea held behind (retrovertis) after the
manner of those that have little to do, and less to care for.

Out of thy bosom] Another posture to the same purpose, Prove. 19.24. and 26.15.

Verse. 12. For God is my King of old] He is the same, yesterday, to^^y, and for
ever. I doubt not therefore but he will see to the safety of his loyal
subjects.

Working salvation in the midst of the earth] i.e. Openly, and to the view of
all. Jerusalem is in the midst of Judaea, and Judea is in the midst of the
earth; the very center and navel of the habitable world, say the Fathers; it
joyneth those of the East to the West by the Midland-sea, and those of the
North to the South by the same Sea, running out as far as the lake of
Maeotis, very far North, and by the red Sea descending very low into the
South. This Country therefore God seems purposely to have espied out, as
himself speaks, that therehence he might send abroad salvation into all
parts. And hereabout, some gather from Joel 3.2. Christ will sit to judge the
world, at the last day, Psalm. 50.1, 2.

Verse. 13. Thou did divide the Sea, etc.] Thou in this and the following
verses is emphaticall and exclusive, q. d. Thou, and none but Thou.

Thou brakest the heads of the Dragons] Or, Crocodiles, So he calls Pharaohs
chieftains who were Satan's swordmen, and with him had their heads broke at the
red Sea.

Verse. 14. Thou brakest the heads of Leviathan] i.e. Of Pharaoh himself. See
Isa. 27.1. and Ezekiel. 29.3. Egypt is situate between two seas; and a great part
of it overflowed by the River Nilus. Pharaoh therefore is fitly compared to the
Master-fish, and his Captains to Crocodiles.

And gave him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness] i. e. To
the birds and wild-beasts, who fed upon the dead carcasses of the Egyptians
cast upon the shore; the Israelites having first taken the spoil of them,
whereby they were provided of many necessaries for their voyage toward Canaan.

Verse. 15. Thou did cleave the fountain and the flood] i. e. Fontium and
torrentium scatebras and latebras, thou did set the rock abroach once and
again, Exodus 17.6. Numb. 20.11. rescissis ipsius naturae legibus.

Thou driedst up mighty rivers] Jordan (wherein some say met two great Rivers,
Jor and Dan) whereunto the Chaldee here adds Arnon and Jabbok, whereof see
Numb. 21.14. Deuteronomy. 2.37.

Verse. 16. The day is thine, the night also is thine] He had argued with God,
and strengthened his own faith from Gods extraordinary works; and now he does
the like from his ordinary works in nature, with the alternal course thereof,
wherein appears a kind of image of the seasonable driving away of calamities,
and turning all things into a desired state, Psalm. 30.5. Lam. 3.23.

Thou have prepared the light and the Sun] i. e. That first light scattered
abroad the heavens, but afterward gathered into the Sun, as into a vessel. By
light some understand here the Moon, that other great luminary; it being the
manner of the Hebrews, nomen generis restringere ad speciens deteriorem.

Verse. 17. Thou have set all the borders of the earth] Securing it from the
overflowings of the Sea, and appointing to the several Nations the bounds of
their habitations.

Thou have made summer and winter] Plasmasti ea. Now thou that have done all
this and more for mankind in general, will thou be wanting to thy Church?

Verse. 18. Remember this] Forgetfulness befalls not the Lord; nevertheless
he gives us leave to be his Remembrancers, and not to keep silence when he is
concerned. Isa. 62.6.

That the enemy] See verse. 10.

And that the foolish people have blasphemed thy Name] This irketh the Saints
worse than their own particular sufferings. The Egyptians, out of their respect
to their Mercurius Trismegistus, would not rashly pronounce his name; no more
would the Grecians their god Jupiter, no not when they swear by him. Turtur
minimus censetur in columbarum genere, Arist^
Should not we be much more tender and respective of the holy and reverend name
of our God, taking it ill when by any it is blasphemed?

Verse. 19. O deliver not the soul of thy Turtle-dove] Turturilla tua, that
groaneth unto thee, being not more innocent chaste, mild, simple and sociable,
than weak, shiftlesse, Columb. mas and faemina dormiunt and pascuntur codem in
loco. Arift. hist. anim. lib. 8. c. 3^ Patitur and non rapit. Kimchi.
and unable to defend her self from those beasts of prey. Optatus, observes,
that no fowl is more preyed upon by Hauks, Kites, etc. than the Dove; yet are
there still more Doves than Hauks or Kites for all that; So the Church
increases, notwithstanding all persecutions.

Unto the multitude] Or, To the beast, the wild-company. The same word is put
here also immediately for the Congregation or lively flock of Christ.

Verse. 20. Have respect unto the Covenant] This the Church knew to be her best
plea; and therefore she so plieth it.

For the dark places of the earth are full of cruelty] That is, says Basil,
those places where men are in the darkness or ignorance, not knowing God, are
full of ambition and tyranny. Others make this the sense. We can hide our
selves no where, but the Persecutors ferret us out.

Verse. 21. O let not the Oppressed, etc.] Contusas non revertatur confusas, let
him not take the repulse, be disappointed of his expected help from Heaven.

Verse. 22. Plead thine own cause] For if we mis-carry, Thou art sure to suffer
among the proud Chaldees, as an impotent God.

Remember how the foolish man, etc.] See verse. 18.

Verse. 23. The tumult of those that rise up against thee increases daily] Heb.
Ascends, viz. up to Heaven, as Jon. 1.2. there is not hoe with them. Mundi
laetitia est impunita nequitia. If the Lord take them not a link lower, as we
say, they will grow intolerably insolent.

PSALM. LXXV
TO the chief Musician Al-taschith] That is, Destroy not; The Chaldee
paraphraseth, In the time when David said, Destroy not the people. The Psalm
seems to have been made either by Asaph in David's name, or by David himself
(and by him committed to Asaph) at such time as the difference depending
betwixt him and Ishosheth, many were slain on both sides: This drew from David
an Al-taschith, not long before he was anointed King over all Israel, 2 Samuel
5.1, etc.

Verse. 1. Unto thee O God, do we give thanks] Heb. We celebrate thee, O God,
we celebrate thee; viz. both for mercies and crosses sanctified; for these also
are to be reckoned upon the score of Gods favors.

For that thy Name is near] Nomen, id est numen, Thy Name, that is, thy self
are near, ad liberandum invocantem, as Aben-Ezra expounds it, to deliver
those that call upon thee.

Verse. 2. When I shall receive the Congregation] i. e. The government of all
the twelve Tribes, as I believe I shall do shortly, according to Gods promise
to me by Samuel.

I will judge uprightly] That a man is in truth, that he is his own particular
place and station; that he is really, that he is relatively.

Verse. 3. The earth, and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved] Both Church
and Commonwealth here are utterly out of order; I shall endeavor mine utmost
to set all to rights, and so to preserve the World from ruin, which subsisteth
by and for the sake of Gods Israel. Absque stationibus non staret mundus.

I bear up the pillars of it] Semen sanctum statumen terrae, Isa. 6.13. The
holy seed upholdeth the State. David did (as Lucan says of Cato) toti genitum
se credere mundo. Jesus Christ much more; he is the true Atlas, upholding all
things by the word of his power, Heb. 1.3.

Verse. 4. I said unto the fools, deal not foolishly] Boast not your selves so
proudly and petulantly, but submit to Gods decree, and my government; how much
more to Christ's?

Lift not up the horn] Metaphor a a tauris cornupetis.

Verse. 5. Lift not up your horn on high] Against the High God; so Tremellius
renders it.

Speak not with a stiff neck] Some render it with an old neck, let old things
pass, and now speak with a new and humble throat. Hard words and stout speeches
uttered from a mind vehemently moved out of its plate (as the word here used,
imports) shall be one day dearly answered for, Jud. 15.

Verse. 6. For Promotion comes neither from the East] Dignitatis nullum est
^^porium. Ambitionists use to look this way and that way how to advance
themselves, but all in vain. Hispanic Monarchia Cathalica debetur divinitus,
sod in Utopia, says One,

Nor from the South] Where the warm sunshine is.

Verse. 7. But God is the Judge] He sits at the stern, and orders all human
affairs, according to the good pleasure of his will.

He puts down one, and sets up another] As we seen in Saul, and David, in
the four great Monarchies, in Bajaz^t and Tamerlan; besides many others. Virtue
exalts the meanest, when villainy tumbleth down the mightiest. Agathocles the
son of a Potter became King of Sicily. Valentinian the son of a Rope-maker
became Emperor of Rome. Justinus was first a Swineheard, then an heardsman,
Anno. Chr. 518.
then a Carpenter, a soldier, and after all, an Emperor. If Alexander, to
show his greatness, advanced Abdilominus from a poor Gardener, to be King in
Sidon, What cannot the Lord do? Tamerlan having overcome Bajazet, asked him
whether ever he had given God thanks for making him so great an Emperor? who
confessed ingenuously he never thought of it; To whom Tamerian replied, (...).
that it was no wonder so ungrateful a man should be made a spectacle of
misery. For you, said he, being blind of one eye, and I lame of a leg, was
there any worth in us, why God should set us over two great Empires of Turks
and Tartars, to command many more worthy than our selves?

Verse. 8. For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup] A cup of affliction,
whereof all must drink more or less. The Chaldee calls it a cup of curse;
Affliction is in it self a fruit of sin, and a piece of the curse. Prove. 23.31,
32.


And the wine is red] And so more powerful, and peircing. That is an
affliction, and grievous, that God makes to be so.

It is full of mixture] i. e. Ready prepared, as Prove. 9.2. Rev. 14.10. (...)
arc^aticu^.
or mingled with spices to make the wine more hot and inebriating.

And he pours out of the same] The Saints sip of the top only, they drink
illud solum quod est suavius and limpidus, the sweeter and clearer part of Gods
cup. Excellently Mr. Bradford Martyr, in a certain letter of his, Drink, says
he, of Gods cup willingly, and at the first when it is fullest, peradventure if
we linger, Act. and Mou^. fol. 1487.
we drink at length of the dregs with the wicked, if at the beginning we drink
not with Gods Children.

But the dregs thereof] The full vialls of divine vengeance.

All the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink them] They shall
drink them every drop, yea though it be eternity to the bottom. This shall be
worse to them than was that ladle-full of scalding lead poured down the throat
of a dr^nken man, by the command of a Turkish Bashaw.

Verse. 9. But I will declare for ever] viz. Gods great goodness in mine
advancement to the Kingdom, and the rest of those wonderful works, verse. 1.

I will sing praises, etc.] This thankful man was worth his weight in the gold
of Ophir.

Verse. 10. All the horns of the Wicked also will I cut off] By promising the
due administration of vindictive and remunerative Justice, he seeks to
insinuate into the peoples affections, who, after Ishbosheths death, came in to
make him King.

But the horns of the Righteous shall be exalted] Dignity shall wait upon
desert, which shall cause it again to be waited upon by respect. Thus it should
be in the Courts of all Princes. In Cyrus his Court, though a man should seek
or chu^e blindfold, he could not miss of a good man, says Xenophon. ^yropaed.

PSALM. LXXVI.
A Psalm or song of Asaph] Or, for Asaph; Either made prophetically by Asaph
himself; or by some other Psalmist who committed it to Asaphs successors, to
be played and sung. The Hebrews say it is made de bello Gogi; (...) In He^^pl^.
of the war with Gog and Magog, that is, the Eastern and Western Antichrist^
The Greeks ^ay (...) Of (...) and his ^ost and (...) the ma^er or the Psalm is
such as very well agrees with that overthrow. Con^er Psalm. 46.^^ 48.

Verse. 1. In Judah is God known] Nobili^ est, says (...) est, says another
Interpreter, i. e. Better known he is now than eve^, not by his Word only which
is preached in Judah, but by his wondrous works; this especially of destroying
the Assyrians at Lachish, in the Tribe of Judah.

His name is great in Israel] Greater now than ever: God having made himself a
glorious names, Isa. 63.14. Egypt rang of this ^la^ghter of the Assyrians as
Herodotus testifies; so did all other Countries, doubtless.

Verse. 2. In Satem also is his Tabernacle] i. e. In Jerusalem, which was first
called Salem, Genesis 14.18. Heb. 7.2. Secondly, Jebus, 1 Chronicles. 11.4. Josh. 15.8.
and 18.28. Thirdly, Jerusalem, Josh. 15.63. and 2 Samuel 5.6. not quasi (...),
Salomons Temple (as Hegefippus would have it, and hence likely came the
aspiration Jerusalem) but from that famous Jehovah, Jireh, Genesis 22.14. with 2.
which Jir^h being added to Salem makes it Jerusalem, the vision of peace. Here
God was pleased to pitch his Tabernacle, moveable, and mean, in respect of Gods
greatness, 1 King. 8.27. Lustrum (...) q. d. In Sion desidet ut leo ad praedam
pitatus. Metap^.


And his dewlling place in Sion] Which therefore he will save and see to, as
every man does to the place of his habitation.

Verse. 3. There brake ^e the arrows of the bow] There? Where? Surely in Sion,
in the holy Assemblies where the Saints were praying, there the Arrow, Shield,
Spear, etc. were broken. This made the Queen Mother of Scotland say, that she
more feared the prayers of John Knox, than an Army of thirty thousand fighting
Soldiers. The King of Sweden, as soon as he set foot in Germany fell down to
Prayer, and what great things did he in a little time? Now for the fruit of
Prayer cried those great Gallants at Edge-hil fight, and did great exploits.
The word he^^ rendered Arrows signifies fiery Darts, see Ephesians. 6.16. a burning
coal, Job 5.7. a light bolt, L^^. 2^. (...).
Psalm. 78.48. the Plague, or Carbuncle, Deuteronomy. 32.24. ^abak. 3.5. Strabo says,
that Ori^es, Gy^^eters, and Aethiopians shot fiery Arrows: so might the
Assyrians. Confer Psalm. 120.4.

The shield, and the sword, and the battle] Both the Men, and the Munition.
This Herodotus had heard of, but mil-relateth the History, lib. 2.

Verse. 4. Thou art more glorious and excellent] Or, more bright and
magnificent. Glorious God was before, but now more glorious by this late
deliverance; illuminating his people with his mavelous light.

Than the mountains of prey] Those vast Hosts of Assyrians lying now upon the
Mountains round about Jerusalem, and plundering the Country at their pleasure.
Thou Lord art far more illustrious and admirable than all those Grassatores
popul^, ac reges qua (...) elati, those mountains of Lions and Leopards, Cant.
4.8. the Kingdoms of this World, enemies to the Church.

Verse. 5. The stout-hearted are spoiled] Heb. have yielded themselves up for a
prey: those that escaped the stroke of the Angel, fled as fast as they could
for their lives, leaving all behind them. The Rabbines expound it, they are
spoiled of their understanding, infatuated.

They have slept their sleep] Their long Iron-sleep (as the Poets call it) of
Death. The destroying Angel has laid them fast enough, and safe enough.

And (...) of the men of might] Viri divili^rum, the vulgar renders it, Men of
riches, such as are all (...), but men of might is better: these men of their
hands could not find their hands, when Gods Angel took them to do.

Verse. 6. At thy rebuke, O God etc.] i. e. with thy mighty word of command, and
without any more ado, God can nod men to destruction, Psalm. 80.16. blow them
into Hell* Job 4.9. rebuke them to death, as here: do it with as much ease as he
that swimeth spreads forth his hands to swim, Isa. 25.11.

The Chai^^ and the Horse] The Chieftains of the Army.

Verse. 7. (...).
(...)] Herodotus says, that (...) was written,(...).

(...) is Gods Wrath revealed plainly and plentifully, Romans 1.28. and (...) he
often appears for his people, and out of an engine.

The earth feared] All was (...), as (...) Thunder (...).

Verse. 9. When God (...)] Being stirred up as it were, by the prayers of his
people, as verse. 2, 3.

To save all the (...) of the earth] Who cease not to seek the Lord, to (...)
righteousness and judgment, Zeph. 2.3.

Verse. 10. Surely the wrath of man shall praise the^] As when (...) army was
destroys the Istraelites sang praise yea the Aegy^ians built Altars as Isa.
19. God by his wisdom orders, and draws the blind and brute motions of the
worst Creatures unto his own honor; as the Hi^ts-man does the rage of the
Dog to his pleasure; or the Mariner the blowing of the Wind to his voyage; or
the (...), the heat of the fire to his Work; or the Physician, the
bloud-thirstiness of the Leech to a Cure, says a Reverend man.

The remainder of wrath shall thou restrain] Heb. Shall thou gird; (...).
that is, curb and keep within compass. The Greek has it, It shall keep holy
day to thee; that is, cease from working, or acting outwardly, how restless
^o^ver it be within.

Verse. 11. Vow and pay to the Lord] A plain precept; and yet Bellarmine says,
Lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 17 De cult. Sanctor. cap. 9.
(...) est praeceptum. As for vowing to Saints, he grants, that when the
Scriptures were written, the Church had no such custom. Saint-worship then is
but new worship.

Let all that he round about him] All the neighboring Nations and so they did,
after Ashurs overthrow, 2 Chronicles. 32.21, 23.

To him that ought to be feared] Heb. To fear, that is, to God the proper
object of fear, called therefore Fear, by an appellative property.

Verse. 12. He shall cut off the spirit of Princes] Vind^^^iabit, he shall slip
them off as one would do a bunch of Grapes, or a Flower between ones fingers:
easily, suddenly, Auferet de (...).
as he dealt by (...) Princes.

He is terrible to Kings] Enemies to his Church, as most Kings are.

PSALM. LXXVII.
A Psalm of Asaph] Or, for Asaph, David's melancholy Psalm some call it, made by
him when he was in grievous affliction and desertion. Out of which he seeks
to wind by earnest Prayer, by deep Meditation upon Gods former favors, and
unchangeable nature; and lastly, by calling to mind Gods wondrous works of
old, both in proving, and in preferving his Church and chosen.

Verse. 1. I cried unto God with my voice, etc.] I prayed instantly and
constantly, and sped accordingly. No faithful prayer is ineffectual.

Verse. 2. In the day of my trouble] The time of affliction is the time of
supplication, Psalm. 50.15.

My fore (...) in the night] Heb. My hand was poured out; that is, stretched
out in prayer; or wet with continual weeping. Non fuit remiss, nec (...) in
lectum.

And ceased not] Or, was not tired; in allusion, belike to Moses his hands held
up against A^^leck; though

My soul refused to be comforted] I prayed on, though I had little heart to do
it, (as Daniel afterward did the Kings work, though he were sick) or though
with much infirmity, whilst I rather wrangled with God, by cavelling
objections, than wrast^ed with him, as I ought to have done, by important
prayer.

Verse. 3. I remembered God, and (...) troubled] (...); for God seemed to be
angry, and to cast out my prayers; this made me mourn, and little less than
(...).

My (...)] With sense of Sin, and seat of Wrath. This was a very grievous and
dangerous temptation, such as we must pray not to be ^^d into, or at least
(...) to be left under, (...).

Verse. 4. (...).

That I cannot speak] Cura l^^es loguuntur, ing^ntes stupent.

Verse. 5. I have considered the days of old] What thou did for Adam,
Abraham, Israel, in Egypt, etc. all which was written purposely, that we
through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope. See Deuteronomy.
32.7.

Verse. 6. I call to remembrance my Song in the night] i. e. My former feelings
and experiments, being glad in this scarcity of comfort, to live upon the old
store, as Bees do in winter.

I commune with mine own heart] Psalm. 4.4. see there.

And my spirit made diligent search] For the cause, and cure of my present
distempers.

Verse. 7. Will the Lord cast off for ever?] No, not at all, though the
extremity and length of the Psalmists grief put him upon these sad
Interrogatories, with some diffidence, touching the Nature, and Promise of God.

Will he be favorable no more?] So the Devil, and carnal reason would have
persuaded him; and did happily for a time. But this very questioning the matter
shows, he yet lay languishing at Hopes Hospital, waiting for comfort. The
Soul may successively doubt, and yet believe.

Verse. 8. Is his mercy clean gone for over?] They that go down into the pit (of
Despair) cannot hope for Gods truth, Isa. 38.18. but so does not any Saint in
his deepest desertions.

Does his promise fail for evermore?] Has he retracted his Promises, recalled
his Oracles confirmed with Oath, Seal? No, he will not suffer his faithfulness
to fail, nor alter the thing that is gone out of his mouth, Psalm. 89.33.

Verse. 9. Has God forgotten to be gracious?] So it seems sometimes to those
that are long afflicted, and short-spirited; But what says the Prophet? Can a
Woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the Son
of her womb? H^yt. Geor.
yea they may forget (they may prove unnatural, and grow out of kind, as Medea,
and those Suevian women, who threw their young Children at the Romans (under
the conduct of Drusus, Son in Law to Augustus) instead of Darts) yet God will
not forget his people, Isa. 49.15. Indeed he can as soon forget himself, and
change his nature.

Has he in anger shut up his tender mercies?] These things the Psalmist
speaks not as utterly despairing, but as one courageously wrestling against
an old Manslayer, and a misgiving heart of his own. Homines vero securi, and
voluptatibus ebrii, nihil horum intelligunt. This is little understood by
profane Sensualists, who therefore reap no great benefit by the reading of
these Psalms.

Verse. 10. And I said, this is my infirmity] My frailty, and folly. Here he
begins to recollect, and recall himself, as every good soul will, after its
extravagancies and out-bursts. Vatablus renders it, Mors mea est, This is my
death; Beza, Caedeo mea haec, This is my Deaths-wound, sc. whereof I should
surely dye, were it not for the change of Gods hand upon me.

But I will remember, etc.] This is supplied out of the following verse. Some
make no such supply, but render the text thus, The right hand of the most High
can change these things. Others, This is the change of the right hand of the
most High, and is therefore to be taken patiently; Shall we receive good at
Gods hands, and not evil, Job 2.10? I am not utterly deserted, but only the
case is a little altered, the right hand of the most High alternated.

Verse. 11. I will remember the works, etc.] Remember, and, commemorate, as the
Hebrew (by a double reading) imports.

I will remember thy Wonders] God is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in
working, Isa. 28. ult. and as we behold the Sun in the waters, so God in his
works, Saculum speculum, the World is a glass or theater, but especially the
Church, wherein God sets forth his wonders to the view of all.

Verse. 12. I will mediate also of all thy works, and ^alk, etc.] See the Note
on Psalm. 45.^.

Verse. 13. Thy way O God is in the Sanctuary] There it is only that I can get
satisfaction about, thy proceedings, Psalm. 73.17. There I am ^^ught, that thou
(...) and holy in all thy works, (...) this text, Thy way O God is (...) q. d.
Thy way is in Heaven, far above man's reach.

Who is so great a God us our God?] And therefore no wonder his ways are so
incomprehensible.

Verse. 14 Thou art the God that do wonders] In the daily defense and
government of thy Church. Thou art the great Thaumaturgus, or wonder-worker.

Thou have declared thy strength among the peoples] As among the Egyptians,
Canaanites, Phil^stines etc. Vere (...) est Deus Chistianorum, said one
Calocerius, an Heathen.

Verse. 15. Thou have with thine arm redeemed thy people] viz. Out of the
bondage of Egypt, that memorable mercy; but nothing to that of ours and theirs
from sins thraldom.

The sons of Jacob, and Joseph] Joseph is instanced, quia nobilis inter
fratres, vel in malis quae pendit, vel in bon^ quae rependit, as Austin has
it. De Doct. Christ. l. 4. c. ^


Verse. 16. The waters saw thee, O God -- they were afraid] This is check to
such as will not see to fear so mighty a God. Lord, says the Prophet, when thy
hand is lifted up they will not see; but they shall see and be ashamed for
their envy at the people; yea the fire of thine enemies shall devour them, Isa.
26.11.

Verse. 17. The clouds poured out water, the skies, etc.] Calvin takes this to
be a description of that hideous tempest, Exodus 9. the seventh Plague of Egypt.
But others with more probability hold, that the Prophet here has respect to
that very time mentioned in the former verse, when the Lord looked unto the
host of the Egyptians out of the fiery and cloudy pillar, and so troubled and
turmoiled them with stormy tempests, that their Charret wheels fell off, and
themselves sank as lead in the mighty waters, Exodus 14.24, 25. and 15.10. Of
these terrible tempests mention is made also by Justin.

Verse. 18. The voice of thy thunder was in the Heaven] Heb. In the Sphere or
round-orb of the air. Of the thunder in the air, see Job 37.2-5. Psalm. 29. This
made the Egyptians say, Let us fly, for God fights for Israel against us.

The lightenings lightened the World] Such flakes of fire there were with
flashes of lightening, as darkened the Sun, and made the whole Heavens seem to
be on a light fire.

Verse. 19. Thy way is in the Sea, etc.] A way of thine own miraculous making.
God usually goes a way by himself.

And thy footsteps are not known] Not so much as is the way of an Eagle in the
air, the way of a Serpent upon a rock, or the way of a ship in the midst of the
Sea, Prove. 30.19. Let God alone with his own work, commit we our selves to him
in well-doing, and it shall go well with us, no question of it. Pii viam
desperatae salutis, impi^ foveam insperatae mortis intrant. Oros.


Verse. 20. Thou leddest thy people like a flock] And so he still leads his
Church with much love and care, by good Magistrates and Ministers, who are as
his under-shepheards.

PSALM. LXXVIII.
MAschil of Asaph] Ode didascalica Asaphi. The six first verses are procemial,
wooing attention from the dignity, difficulty, antiquity, certainty, etc. of
the matter in this Psalm discoursed on, containing an abstract of the whole
Pentateuch, and acquainting us with the ancient way of preaching, which was an
historical narration of the miraculous mercies that God had from time to time
conferred upon his people, their hateful abuse of his benefits, and their
punishments thereupon. This is to be seen in sundry Psalms, in St. Stephens
Sermon, Act 7. and St. Paul's, Act. 13. and est sane valde venerandum ist^d
sancta antiquitatis (...); This is a very venerable momment of holy antiquity,
and teaches us the right use of history, quae dicta est (...) says Plato.

Verse. 1. Give ear O my people to my Law] i. e. To my Doctin, which has its
name in Hebrew from darting it into the soul; and these are the Psalmists words
in Gods name, calling for utmost attention.

Incline your ears, etc.] Lay them close to my lips, that no parcel of this
sacred language fall to the ground by your default, (...), A^rizate, auribus
h^^rite, Receive it into your ears; yea, draw up the ears of your mind to the
ears of your bodies, that one sound may pierce both, Act. 2.14. Isa. 55.3. Hear
and give ear, be not proud, for the Lord has spoken it, Jer. 13.15.

Verse. 2. I will open my mouth in a parable] I will speak freely and plainly (
I will open my mouth, Mat. 5.2. Act. 10.34.) and yet acutely and accurately,
See Psalm. 49.4. with the Note.

I will utter dark sayings of old] Heb. I will wel-out (as from a spring or
fountain) dark or sharp sayings, transacted and recorded of old, but of good
use for ever. Difficulty does not discourage, but rather whet on heroic
spirits to a more diligent inquiry. Aben-Ezra notes here, that verse 9. The
children of Ephraim, etc. is a parable, and verse 25. Man did eat Angels food,
is a riddle, or dark saying.

Verse. 3. Which we have heard and known] Hearing and seeing are the two learned
senses, whereby knowledge, yea life, enters into the soul, Prove. 2.2, 10. Isa.
55.3.

And our Fathers have told us] Have delivered down to us from hand to hand,
whetting upon us the written word, Deuteronomy. 6.7. and adding thereunto, for
explication, many other things fit to be known.

Verse. 4. We will not hide them from their children] The manifestation of the
spirit is given to every man to profit withal, 1 Cor. 12.7. neither is any one
born, (much less born again) for himself; but must be as useful as may be in
his Generation, Paulum s^pultae distat i^ertiae
Celata virtus. -- Hor.



The praises of the Lord] The praiseworthy acts of God for his people, and
against their enemies; for these two are not sundred, Phil. 1.28.

Verse. 5. For he established a testimony in Jacob, etc.] Lest any should
attribute too much to ancient traditions, and to show that Antiquity must have
no more authority than what it can maintain; the Psalmist here (as afterward
the Prophet Esaias) calls them, to the Law, and to the Testimonies; for if any
speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them, Isa.
8.26.

Verse. 6. Who shall arise and declare them] i. e. Succeed their Parents both in
their place and office of teaching their posterity; not suffering the truth
which is after godliness, ( Tit. 1.1.) to fall and fall in the streets, Isa.
59.14, 15. or if it do, raising it up again, and restoring it to their utmost.

Verse. 7. That they might set their hope in God] Summa legis divinae and
scopus, this is a brief of the Bible, viz. to believe in God and obey his law;
both which men shall the better do, if they forget not his works.

Verse. 8. And might not be as their Fathers] Fathers are not always to be
followed, Cicero Epist.
Ezekiel. 20.18, 19. He zealously affected his Fathers, but not well, who said, I
will follow them sicut bos armentum, e^iamsi ^uant, though I fall with them.

A stubborn and rebellious Generation] Aver satrix and irritatrix.

A Generation that set not, etc.] Double-minded men, unstable in all their
ways, Jam. 1.8. having religionem ephemeram, as Beza said of Balduin, that
Ecebolius the second.

And whose spirit was not steadfast with God] As was that Martyrs who said,
Though you may pluck the heart out of my body, yet you shall never pluck the
truth out of my heart. The Heavens shall sooner fall, said Another, than I will
forsake the Truth I have once received.

Verse. 9. The children of Ephraim being armed, etc.] This the Rabbines
interpret of eight thousand Ephraimites, who would needs break prison, as it
were, out of Egypt (before the time that God had set for their deliverance
thence) and seize upon Palestina the promised Land; but with evil success;
for they were slain by the men of Gath, to the great grief of their Father
Ephraim, 1 Chronicles. 7.21, 22, 23. and to the increase of their servitude in
Egypt, Exodus 1. This is historia Caballica. See R. Solomon on those words,
Exodus 15.14. the people shall hear and be afraid; sorrow shall take hold on the
inhabitants of Palestina, who remembering what a slaughter they once made of
these Ephraimites, shall fear the just revenge of that cruelty. Others
interpret this text by Judge. 1.29. and some by 2 King. 17. with Hos. 10.6, 7,
8, etc. but this to me seems likeliest. These are ancient things, and of
such the Psalmist promises to treat, verse. 2, 3.

Being armed and carrying bows] Trusting to their own strength, and warlike
preparations; and choosing rather to be counted temerarious than timorous.

Turned back in the day of battel] Carnal confidence seldom comes home,
otherwise than weeping.

Verse. 10. They kept not the Covenant, etc.] And so betrayed themselves into
the hands of divine justice, they were worthily worsted. See 2 Chronicles. 15.2.

And refused walk in the law] They were set upon it, and would not be ruled by
their Father Ephraim, or any other that counseled them to the contrary; and
happily said the like to them that Archidamus did to his over-daring son, Aut
viribus add, aut animis adime, Either add to thy forces, or abate of thy
courage.

Verse. 11. And forgot his works and his wonders] Forgetfulness is a grave; and
ingrato quicquid donatur, deperditur, all is lost that is conferred on an
ungrateful person.

Verse. 12. Mavelous things did he, etc.] Whereof they were eyewitnesses, and
therefore could not plead ignorance, or excuse. The Hebrew has it, a marvel,
or a miracle, collective.

In the field of Zoan] Corruptly called afterward Tan and Tanis; Ptolom. Strabo.
a populous and principal City of Egypt even in Isaiahs time, chap. 19. one
hundred and eighty furlongs from Memphis, says Josephus; there Moses wrought
his miracles.

Verse. 13. He divided the Sea] Making it fordable for them, and fixing those
fluid waters, like stone walls on each hand of them, whiles they passed
thorough with ease and safety. Every main affliction is our Red Sea; which
while it threats to swallow, preserves us.

Verse. 14. In the daytime also he led them with a cloud] This cloud not only
conducted them, but also compassed them in on every side, both to keep them
from the parching heat of the Sun, and to save them from the sight and violence
of their enemies, Exodus 13.21. A figure of Gods guidance of his Church, and
protection over the same, Isa. 4.5. Neh. 9.9.

Verse. 15. He clave the rocks] And set them abroach, both that in Rephidim,
Exodus 17. and the other in Cadesh, Number. 20. Moses Nehamides, on Exodus 17.
says, that the old Jew-doctors held that the Rock of Rephidim not only yielded
waters like a river all those forty years wherein they were in the wilderness,
but followed them also there whithersoever they went. This agrees well with
that of the Apostle St. Paul. 1 Cor. 10.4. who sweetly allegorizeth this
history.

As out of the great deeps] i. e. In great abundance. Rocks sooner yield fire
than water; but what cannot God do? Ad (...) usque.


Verse. 16. He brought streams also out of the Rock] Idem enuntiat per
Epexege^i, ad miraculi magnitudinem ostendendam. The same again, to set forth
the greatness of the miracle. This was a standing miracle, as was also the
pillar of cloud, the pillar of fire, and the Manna.

Verse. 17. And they sinned yet more against him] The better he was to them, the
worse were they toward him; as if God had hired them to be wicked; and this was
ordinary with them, and is still amongst us. Oh the divine patience!

By provoking the most High in the wilderness] In terra arida ubi Deo indies
indigebant, ibi peccabant, says Aben-Ezra here. This was another aggravation
of their sin.

Verse. 18. And they tempted God in their hearts] In their hearts first, but
afterward also with their lips. The Psalmist here strikes at the root of
their wickedness.

By asking meat for their lust] Not for their necessity (that had been more
excusable, Prove. 6.30.) but to satisfy their inordinate appetite, to gratify
their licorish palate.

Verse. 19. Yea they spoke against God] Their villainous and foul thoughts
blistered and brake out at their lips.

Can God furnish a table?] This was a blasphemous question. God can do more
than he will; but whatsoever he will do, that shall be done, and nothing can
hinder it. Lord, if thou will, thou can make ^i^e clean, said he in the
Gospel. And this was better than that of the other, who said, If thou can do
any thing, help us, Mar. 9.

Verse. 20. Behold he smote the Rock, etc.] And so showed his power; we cannot
deny it; but now for his will.

Can he give bread also, etc.?] They should have said, will he serve our lusts?
but that they were ashamed to say.

Can he provide flesh for his people?] i. e. Dainty and delicate flesh, such as
is that of Quails, meat for a King; for they carried their cattle out of Egypt
with them; and so they could not be without ordinary flesh, too good for such
unthankful miscreants.

Verse. 21. Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth] Efferbuit, excanduit.
Anger is a kind of fire, a boiling of the blood about the heart, thorough
desire of revenge. But fury is not in me, says God, Isa. 27.4. If anger be
ascribed unto him, as here, it is an expression fitted to our apprehension,
because he does that which angry men use to do, viz. chide, and smite for sin;
but all in a way of justice, and without the least perturbation.

So a fire was kindled] It began to smoke and burn.

And anger also came up] Ascended, i. e. Flamed, for anger begins at the
heart, and then comes up into the brain, face, nostrils.

Verse. 22. Because they believed not in God] As faith is a radical and
complexive grace, so is unbeleef a radical sin, a teeming vice, Heb. 3.12. a
wel-spring of wickedness; Many sins are bound up in it, as Cicero says of
Parricide.

And trusted not in his salvation] i. e. In his saving promises.

Verse. 23. Though he had commanded the clouds] Though he had served them as
never Prince was served in his greatest state, yet all served not turn.

And opened the doors of heaven] Rupturas nubium raining down upon them plenty
of Manna; so that it was not hunger, but humor that set them a lusting.

Verse. 24. And had rained down Manna upon them] Manna signifies, what is this?
whereunto in the Allegory answers, This is my body. Or, according to others,
it signifies a prepared portion, prepared by God, so that they might presently
eat of it, though they might grind, or pun, or bake, or boil it also, they
might do any thing with it, as they might with meal; whence it is here called
the corn of heaven, that is, a seed which was unto them in stead of corn.

Verse. 25. Pan de nobles Hispan.
Man did eat Angels food] Heb. the bread of the mighty. (Angels are called
mighties, Isa. 10.34. Rev. 18.21.) such delicate bread as might beseem Angels
to eat, if they did eat any at all; such as the Poets fain to be their Nectar,
and Ambrosia. Or, the bread of the mighty, sc. that mightily strengthened them.

He sent them meat to the full] Heb. Meat taken in hunting; so called, because
dainty as venison, or, quia semper ambulabant, and in via quasi eam venabantur,
sc. Josh. 1.11. Aben-Ezra.


Verse. 26. He caused an East Wind to blow] Pergere, to go, to pass away, and to
give place to the South Wind.

And by his power, he brought in the South-wind] That it might bring in the
Quails. Lib. 10. c. 23.
Now Pliny writes, that Quails, though they love to fly with the wind because
of their heavy bodies and small strength, yet not with the Southwind, because
it is moist and so more heavy than the Northwind, which therefore they rather
delight in. And if this be true, here is another miracle, faith an Expositour,
that these Quails were brought in by that wind, which when it blows, they
commonly rest and hide themselves.

Verse. 27. He rained flesh also upon them as dust] Dapibus illos compluit. This
he had done once before for them. See Exodus 16. with Numb. 11. their unbeleef
therefore and impatiency this second time was the more heinous.

Verse. 28. And he let it fall in the midst of their camp] A days journey on
each side, and about two cubits above the earth, Number. 11.31. in such abundance,
that Moses could not believe it were possible to be done, though all the fish
in the Sea should be gathered together, and turned into flesh. ^ib.

Verse. 29. So they did eat and were filled] But better they had fasted. Many
eat that on earth, which they must d^^gest in hell; these here were murdering
(...).

He gave them their own desire] They were heard, ad voluntatem, non ad
utilitatem. Deus saepe dat ira^^ quod negat propitius. Gods gifts to a
graceless man are giftless gifts; and he had better a great deal be without
them.

Verse. 30. They were not estranged from their lust] Satiated they were, but not
satisfied. It is as easy to quench the fire of Aetna, as the thoughts set on
fire by lust.

Verse. 31. The wrath of God came upon them] Heb. Ascended, as a flame, which
the bigger it grows, the higher it gets.

And slew the fattest of them] Those that had glutted and stuffed themselves
like a wool-pack, being nitida and been curata cute pingues, fat and
fair-liking.

And smote down the chosen men of Israel] Or, The young men, who by a hasty
Testament bequeathed that new name Kibroth hattaanah, that is, the graves of
lust, to the place they lay buried in.

Verse. 32. For all this they sinned still] They utterly lost the fruit of their
calamities; which godly men hold a very great loss.

And believed not] Neither mercies nor crosses duly affected them.

Verse. 33. Therefore their days did he consume in vanity] So that they never
saw the promised land, for the which they came out of Egypt; but their
carcasses fell in the wilderness. Who knows, says a Reverend man, whether
God purpose not to wear out this present Generation that has been defiled with
the superstition of the land, that we may not see the good that he will bring
upon this Church?

And their years in trouble] Or, in terror, for they were in continual fear
of Gods wrath, of their enemies round about; of wild beasts, fiery Serpents,
etc.

Verse. 34. When he slew them, then they sought him] Fictis scilicet, quibusdam
and fucatis pollicitationibus, with a few dissembled devotions. So many now,
Plin. Ep. 26. l. 7.
when deadly sick, will be wondrous good. Nuper me amici eujusdem languor
admonuit, optimos esse nos dum infirmi sumus. As Iron is very soft and
malleable whiles in the fire, but soon after returns to its former hardness;
so many, whilst afflicted seem very well affected, but afterward soon show
what they are. William R^fus in a fit of sickness at Gloucester vowed upon his
recovery to see all vacancies in the Church furnished; which he did, but with
so great adoo, as showed that having escaped the danger, he would willingly
have deceived the Saint, says the Chronicler. Dan. Hist. fol. 58.
In the sweating-sickness here in England, so long as the ferventness of the
Plague lasted, there was crying, Peccavi, peccavi, the Ministers were sought
for in every corner; You must come to my Lord, you must come to my Lady, etc.
but this lasted with many little longer than the disease; so deceitful is man's
heart, and desperately wicked. Most men are nailed to the earth (says One
well) as Sisera was by Ja^l; and will not so much as lift up their eyes to
Heaven, unless it be as Hogs do, who go nodling down; and rooting in the earth
all their life, and never look upward, till being ready to be killed, they are
laid flat upon their back and forced; so these, till wrestling with the pangs
of death, they are fastened to their sick beds, etc.

And they returned] but they gave but the half-turn; they turned not even unto
God with all their heart, as Joel 2.12.

And enquired early after God] Heb. Manicabant sive aurorizabant Deum, aurora
velut anticipata; they were up and at it by peep of day.

Verse. 35. And they remembred] Misery is the best art of memory. But this
remembrance of God was but as letters written in the sand, or as a picture
drawn on the Ice, that long continues not; 'twas but a flash, and while they
were in a good mood; 'twas but as Nebuchadnezzars dream, which he had soon
forgotten. They remembered God, lingua non cord, with the tongue, but not with
the heart. as Aben-Ezra here glosseth. They gave God a mess of fair words,
calling him Rock, Redeemer, etc. but he is not to be so courted and
complemented, Goats may be fed with leaves, but God is not mocked.

Verse. 36. Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth] They looked
pitifully, as the Fox caught in a gin does, but it is only to get out; they
spoke God fair, as the Devil in the Gospel did our Savior, but it was only to
be rid of him. They worshipped him, as the Indians do the Devil, that he may do
them no hurt. The Latin word Colo, to worship, is by some derived of the Greek
word (...) to flatter, and the English word flatter, from the Greek (...) to
worship. Sure it is that many men's devotion is mere dissimulation.

And they lied unto him] sc. Whiles they called him Rock Redeemer, and all was
but from the teeth outward; which how much God abhors as a ludibrious
devotion, see Jer. 3.4, 5. And here is said to be the middle of the Psalter;
for hither to the Hebrews reckon one thousand two hundred sixty and three
verses; and as many they note to be yet left in the Second part.

Verse. 37. For their heart was not right with him] It was still the old heart,
without any sincere change; and that can never hold out the hardship of
Holiness, but will deviate and falsify: The Rack may make it roar, the Rod
flutter, but all is in Hypocrisy. An Hypocrite would cosen God of Heaven if
he could tell how.

Neither were they steadfast,] See verse. 8.

Verse. 38. But he being full of compassion] Not standing upon terms, not taking
advantages; a sin-pardoning God, whose Mercy rejoices against (or glories
over) Judgment, Jam. 2.13. it is of his mercy that we are not consumed, Lam.
3.22. if he should deal with us in strict justice, Et delicta nostra ad
calculos vocare, there were no abiding by it, Psalm. 130. and 143.

Yea many a time turned he his anger away] With patience and pity, he overcame
their provocations, although they tempted him ten times, that is very often,
Numb. 14.20.

And did not stir up all his wrath] Heb. he multiplied to turn away his wrath,
Strenue curavit ut cohiberet iram suam, he let fall some drops of his wrath,
but would not shed the whole shower of it.

Verse. 39. For he remembered that they were but flesh] i. e. Frail and feeble,
full of sin and misery. (See Genesis 6.3.) altogether unable to grapple with Gods
wrath.

A wind that passes away, etc.] Et in suis reciprocationibus evanescens. For
Winds neither return thither whence they blow, nor yet pass from one coast to
another, but are wasted in the middle of the World, by the force of the Sun,
and by their own motion, as Aristotle concludes in his Discourse concerning
Meteors. Now, what is man (says Nazianzen) but soul and soil, breath and body;
a puff of Wind the one, a pile of Dust the other, no solidity in either?

Verse. Exclamatio pa^hetica.
40. How often did they provoke him in the Wilderness?] Ten times at least in the
first two years, Number. 14. and 19. What then in all the rest? Quis fando possit
enacrare tot rebelliones. From the very day they came out of Egypt, they were
always contending against the Lord, as Moses tells them, when he was taking
his leave of them, Deuteronomy. 31.

And grieve him in the Desart] Where they were at his mercy, and at his
immediate finding.

Verse. 41. Yea they turned back and tempted God] They did it afresh, and after
some resolutions and short-winded wishes of doing better.

And limited the holy one] Designarunt, they prescribed to him, and set him his
bounds which he must not pass; as Popilius the Roman Ambassador drew a Circle
round about King Antiochus, and bade him give answer ere he stirred out of it,
for he would be put off no longer. Now God is limited, when as either his power
is questioned, as verse. 20. or his will circumscribed, as if he were bound to
serve men's lusts, or means appointed him whereby he must work, and not
otherwise.

Verse. 42. They remembered not his hand] Forgetfulness is the root of rebellion
and of all vice, Seneca.
as the Genevists well note here. Eaten bread is soon forgotten, Nihil citius
senescit quam gratia.

Nor the day when he delivered them] viz. From Pharaoh, but so soon as they had
sucked the Honey, they despised the flower.

Verse. 43. How he had wrought his signs in Aegypt] That Stage of Wonders. See
verse. 12.

In the field of Zoan] A great City in Egypt; whereof read Es. 19.11.13. and
30.4. Ezekiel. 30.14. Josephus Antiq. lib. 1. cap. 9. See verse. 12.

Verse. 44. And had turned their rivers into blood, etc.] Seven of those Ten
Plagues of Egypt are here instanced, to aggravate the forgetness and perfidy
of the Israelites. Good-turns aggravate unkindnesses, and out offenses are
increased by our obligations.

And their floods that they could not drink] Vsque adeo ut aqua potabiles
totam, alioqui stagnantem Aegyptum, deficerent. The Rabbines say (but who told
them, Midras T^ling.
I know not) that out of the same vessel an Egyptian drank blood, and an
Israelite water.

Verse. 45. He sent diverse sorts of Flies amongst them] Miscellam muscarum
venenatarum, venomous Flies, and flying Serpents, whose poison and sting did
even corrupt the Land, Exodus 8.24. The Greek renders it (...), the Dog-fly.

Verse. 46. He gave also their increase unto the Caterpiller] Together with the
Grasshopper, Exodus 9. Gods great army, Joel 2.

And their labour] i. e. The fruits of the earth, which they had labored for;
they lost both their Husbandry, and their Harvest.

Verse. 47. He destroyed their Vines with hail] Heb. He killed, Quia planta
habes animam vegetativam, ut Job 14.8. says Kimchi.

And their Sycamore trees with frost] Or, with great hailstones mingled with
fire, running along and catching, Exodus 9.24. Confer Rev. 16.21.

Verse. 48. He gave up their Cattle also to the Hail] Moses says men also, who
were brained and burned by it.

Verse. 49. By sending evil Angels amongst them] i. e. Some messengers of his
wrath and displeasure, whether good or evil Angels it skills not.

Verse. 50. He made a way to his anger] Heb. He weighed a path, recompensing
their unjust stifness with his just Judgments, and proceeding in his anger
from lighter plagues to that heaviest of all the rest, the slaying of all the
flower of Egypt in one night, verse. 51.

Verse. 51. And smote all the firstborn in Egypt] Certo pest is genere
perniciocissimo and acutissimo. The Rabbis say, that in each house was a dead
corpse, viz. the Chief^ain of the Family, whether there were a firstborn in it
or not, Exodus 12.30.

In the Tabernacle of Ham] Who was the Father of Mizraim, the founder of the
Egyptians, Genesis 10. who vainly boasted that they were (...), Her. lib. 2.
as ancient as their Land. Herodotus the Author of that Story, tells us also of
a certain great Town in Egypt called Chemmim, from Cham likely.

Verse. 52. But made his own people to go forth like sheep] i. e. Tuto and
lent, softly and safely, as Genesis 33.13. tending them with all tenderness, and
providing for their necessities.

Verse. 53. And he led them on safety, so that they seared not] Or, if they did,
it was without cause; Cur enim metuat hominem homo in sinu Dei positus.

Verse. 54. And he brought them to the border of his Sanctuary] i. e. Of Judaea,
which Country he had consecrated to himself for the place and chief seat of
religion: whence it is called, the holy Land. It had been a loathsome Land,
Ezra 9.11. filled with filthiness from corner to corner, but now otherwise. How
it was afterward again polluted, see Isa. 1.21, 22, 23.

Even to this mountain] Moriah, whereon stood the Temple: or, to this
mountainous Country of Judea.

Which his right hand, etc.] See Psalm. 44.3.

Verse. 55. He cast out the Heathen also before them] i. e. In their sight, and
for their sake.

He divided them an inheritance by line] Not a material Line, but Mathematical,
Geneb.
says an interpreter; whereby we may perceive that the way of making Maps was
anciently in use among the Hebrews.

And made the Tribes of Israel, etc.] Notwithstanding all their former
provocations. See that none render evil for evil to any man, but ever follow
(by Gods example) that which is good, both amongst your selves, and toward all
men, 1 These. 5.15.

Verse. 56. Yet they tempted and provoked, etc.] Neither Gods Judgments on
their enemies, nor his Mercies to themselves, could keep them within the bounds
of obedience; but in a Land of uprightness they would deal unjustly, and not
behold the Majesty of the Lord, Isa. 26.10.

Verse. 57. But turned back, etc.] They had a kind of willingness and velleity,
a kind of wambling, as one speaks, but it boiled not up to the full height
of resolution for God.

They were turned aside like a deceitful bow] Non semper feriet quodc^^que
minabitur arcus, but a deceitful bow, that turns back into belly, as we say,
will be sure to deceive the Archer, though he level his eye and his arrow never
so directly to the Mark, and think with himself to hit it. Lo, such a false
rotten bow is man's deceitful heart; and hence the arrows of his purposes and
promises vanish often in the air as smoke.

Verse. 58. For they provoked him to auger with their high places] After the
manner of the Heathens; yet with a good intention as they called it; because
God is to be every where worshipped. But this was against an express law, Deuteronomy.
14. Exodus 20.

Verse. 59. When God heard this] Sin cries aloud in Gods ears, though it be
never so closely and cunningly carried.

And greatly abhorred Israel] As appears all along the book of Judges,
whereof this verse is a summary.

Verse. 60. So that he forsook the Tabernacle of Shiloh] Whither it had been
brought from Gilgal, and where it had rested a long while, but was forsaken of
God when once idolized, 1 Samuel 4.

The Tent which he placed amongst men] Which was a very great condescension,
Isa. 66.1. Confer Joh. 1.14. Pro. 8.31.

Verse. 61. And delivered his strength -- his glory, etc.] i. e. His Ark which
is elsewhere called the strength of God, 1 Chronicles. 16.11. 2 Chronicles. 6.41. and the
glory of God, Psalm. 26.8. and 63.3. because out of it he was wont to declare
his power and glory, and to make himself visible after a sort.

Verse. 62. He gave his people also unto the sword] sc. Of the Philistines, who
slew thirty thousand of them in one battle, 1 Samuel 4. they lost him and
themselves too; the Ark having been a far better defense to them than the
Palladium to the Trojans.

Verse. 63. The fire consumed] The fire of warlike force, which quickly licketh
up all, and lays waste.

And their Maidens were not given in marriage] Heb. Praised, as they wont to be
at their weddings with nuptial songs, and Epithalamia's, which the Hebrews
call Hillulim, and the bride-chamber, Beth-halulah, the house of praise.

Verse. 64. Their Priests fell by the sword] Hophni and Phineas did, 1 Samuel
4.11. both in one day, as had been foretold, 1 Samuel 2.34.

And their Widows made no lamentation] As being themselves either killed with
grief, as Phineas his wife, or carried captive. Here were ingentia, beneficiae,
flagitia, supplicia.

Verse. 65. The Lord awaked, as one out of sleep] Humanitus dictum; the
Philistines happily had such bald conceits of him, that either he slept; or if
awake, that he was overcome with wine.

Verse. 66. And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts] viz. With emrods, 1 Samuel 5.6, 9, 12. infami podicis ignominia affecit illos, he punished them, as
we do puny-boyes on their posteriours.

Verse. 67. Moreover he refused, etc.] He would dwell no longer at Shiloh, which
was in the Tribe of Ephraim.

Verse. 68. But chose the Tribe of Judah] He chose it for his love, and then
loved it for his choice. The word Tribe we borrow from the Romans, who at first
divided the multitudes into three parts, called thereof Tribes. The Hebrew name
signifies a rod or scepter, and fitly agrees to Judah.

Verse. 69. Like high palaces] Not places, as some books absurdly have it. Like
the earth, There shall be a Church to the Worlds end.

Verse. 70. He chose David also] God chooses not as man does, 1 Cor. 1.26. yet
Alexander the great advanced Abdolominus a poor Gardener to be King in Sidon.

And took him from the sheep-folds] The art of feeding cattle, and the art of
ruling men are sisters, says Basil.

Verse. 71. From following the ^^es] So Saul from seeking Asses, Agathocles from
making pots, Hist. tripart. lib. 9.
Valentinian (...), etc. Pla^illa called upon her husband Theodosius the
Emperor, to remember from what mean estate God had called him to the highest
honors, (...).

Verse. 72. So he fed them, etc.] See verse. 70. He was not malus vir bonus
pr^^ceps (as is said of our Richard the third) but every way accomplished, and
active for the good of his subjects.

PSALM. LXXIX.
A Psalm] Of like subject, with Psalm 74. bewayling the same calamity of the
Jews, whether under Nebuchadnezzar or Antiochus is uncertain; but foreseen by
Asaph, or described by some other Prophet, and committed to some of Asaphs
successors to be sung. Cantant justi etiam in adversis; as birds in the Spring
tune most sweetly, when it raineth most sadly.

Verse. 1. O God the Heathen] Ex abrupto ord^tur; q. d. can thou endure it? Is
it not high time for thee to set in? Lo they have filled the breadth of thy
land, O Immanuel, Isa. 8.8. that is, O thou who art God with us, who give
with the Father, Cum part dator, inter nos petitor. Aug.
who prayest with the suitor, and who in all our afflictions art afflicted.

The holy Temple have they defiled] Spoliando, funestando, and omnia profana
impiaque munera obeundo, See Psalm. 74.7.

They have laid Jerusalem on heaps] In rudera, into an Orchard-keepers cottage,
(...). Sept.
says the Vulgar. An elegant Hypotyposis.

Verse. 2. The dead bodies of thy Servants] Either they denied them the honor
of burial (which is reckoned among the (...) the dues of the dead) or else
they mangled their dead bodies, and exercised their rage upon them, (...), etc.
as the Papists did upon Husse, and Zuinglius, and many of the English Martyrs.
A barbarous practice, as Pausan^as judged it in Herodot. Call^ope.

The flesh of thy Saints, etc.] Of thy beneficiaries, whose souls are with thee
in Heaven; these have not so much as a burying-place on earth, but lie like
common carrion Morticina, like cattle that dye of the murrain, and are most
ignominiously dealt withal: And yet these are Gods Saints, and in some sense,
Martyrs.

Verse. 3. Their blood have they shed like water] They made no more reckoning of
it, than of ditch-water; and were ready to say as Hannibal did when he saw a
ditch full of men's blood, O formosum spectacutum! O beautiful sight!
Contemptim vel abjecte.


And there was none to bury them] Either none to bury them at all; Immaniatis
est Scythicae non sepelir^ mortuos. Sen. ad Ma^tiam.
which the Jews accounted worse than death, Eccles. 6. and the Romans extreme
cruelty: Or none to bury them, cum ritibus with the accustomed rites and
ceremonies, as Jacob was buried, Genesis 50. but not Jeconiah, Jer. 22.18.

Verse. 4. We are become a reproach to our neighbours] To the Edomites,
Philistines, Syrians, Tyrians, etc. who do now compose comedies out of our
tragedies.

A scorn and derision to them that are round about us] Quorum opprobriis,
Iudibriis, and contumeliis sumus expositi. This was more grievous to them than
stripes or wounds, says Chrysostom; because these being infflicted upon the
body, are divided after a sort betwixt soul and body; but scorns and reproaches
do wound the sold only. Hebet quendam aculeum contumelia, they leave a sting
behind them, Act. 5 in Ver.
as Cicero observes.

Verse. 5. How long will thou be angry, etc?] Or, How long? will thou be angry
for ever? The Psalmist knew that the enemies were but Gods executioners; and
that if he were but once pacified, they should soon be put out of office.

Shall thy jealousy] viz. For our Idolatry, Exodus 20.

Verse. 6. Pour out thy wrath, etc.] Even the full vials of it.

That have not known thee] More than by the book of the Creatures, wherein
there is indeed a (...), something of God manifested, Romans 1.19, 20. even his
eternal power and Godhead, rendering men without excuse, but nothing of his
goodness and patience leading them to repentance, chap. 2.4.

That have not called upon thy Name] A note of profaneness, Psalm. 14.4.

Verse. 7. For they have devoured Jacob] As Wolves and other ravenous creatures
do the simple sheep.

His dwelling-place] Or, his cottage, his sheep-coat.

Verse. 8. O remember not against us former iniquities] Or, The iniquities of
them (...) were before us, wherewith we also are justly chargeable; the sin of
the golden calf, says the Arabic here, (...). Diodor. Curt. lib. 7.
an ounce whereof is in all our sufferings to this day, say the Jews. Alexander
slew the Bran^hidae, and utterly destroyed their City, because their
Forefathers had long before endeavored to betray Greece into the hands of
Xerxes.

Speedily prevent us] Lest they come too late; for we are at last gasp.

Verse. 9. Help us -- for the glory of thy Name] A speeding argument. God will
do much for his own glory, his wife as it were.

Purge away our sins] Which nothing can do, but tender mercy.

Verse. 10. Where is their God?] See Psalm. 42.3. So Turks at this day (when they
have the better of Christians) cry, where is the Christians God? We are the
right Musalmans, etc.

By the revenging of the blood of thy Servants, etc.] For the which make thou
inquisition, and do justice.

Verse. 11. Let the sighing of the prisoner, etc.] It was lately in many places
of this land a like difficult thing, to find a wicked man in the enemies
prisons, or a godly man out of them. The sights of such were shril in Gods ears.

Preserve thou those that are appointed to dye] Heb. The children of death,
those that being destined to destruction seem to be as much in deaths power, as
children are in their Parents. The Arabic renders it, Redime filios
occisorum, Redeem the children of those who are slain, lest the name of their
Parents be blotted out.

Verse. 12. Into their bosomes] Full measure, pressed down, shaken together, and
running over, Luke 6.38. See Isa. 65.6, 7. Jer. 32.18.

Wherewith they have reproached thee] viz. In reproaching us, who do quarter
arms, as it were, with thee.

Verse. 13. So we thy people -- will give thee praise] A service which the
Saints know to be so acceptable to God, that they commonly promise it, and
accordingly perform it, Hos. 14.2. engaging also their children, as here, to do
the like.

PSALM. LXXX.
UPon Shosha^nim Eduth] Which some render the lillies of the Testimony, and
interpret of the Jewish polity or Commonwealth called by Josephus (...), that
is, a God-government. Kimchi says that Shosha^nim Eduth is species ^oni nobis
hodi^ ignota, a kind of musical strain not known to us now adays.

Verse. 1. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel] Thou that feeedest thy people,
watchest over them, defendest, redeemest, reducest them; Thou that handlest
them, curest them, washest them, drivest them as they are able to go, carryest
them in thy bosom, do all the offices of a good Shepherd for them. In
calling upon God, it is wisdom to make choice of fit appellations and
attributes, such as may strengthen our faith, and increase our fervor.

Thou that leadest Joseph] Joseph is named quia nobilis inter fratres, says
Austin; the first-birth-right was taken from Reuben, and given to Joseph, 1 Chronicles. 5. hence he is put for the whole people.

Thou that dwell between (or fittest upon) the Cherubims] Those winged
creatures that covered the mercy-seat, the Ark, and the two Tables of the Law
within it; And all, to set forth Christ covering the curses of the Law, and
graciously dwelling with the sons of men, to the admiration of Angels.

Shine forth] Show thy power in saving thy people, and punishing their enemies.
Shine as the Sun does in his strength.

Verse. 2. Before Ephraim Benjamin and Manasseh] These three Tribes went next
after the Ark, when it removed, Number 2. and 10.

Stir up thy strength] Which seems at present to lie, dormant.

Verse. 3. Turn us again] Turn again our captivity, or show thy self reconciled
unto us in Christ, who is here called the face of God, as some conceive.

Verse. 4. O Lord God of Hoasts] Jehova bellipotens Deus. God has his upper and
nether forces, as his horse and foot ready pressed, say the Rabbines.

How long will thou be angry?] Heb. Will thou smoke? As angry people seem to
send out smoke at their nostrils.

Against the prayer of thy people] This is a sore affliction to the Saints,
that their prayers seem to be ineffectuall.

Verse. 5. Thou feedest them with the bread of tears] Panibus fletu intinct is.
Chald. Kimchi.
It is as ordinary with them to weep, as it is with men to eat and drink.

And give them tears to drink in great measure] Trientales they are Tricongii
in a sense, to their sorrow. They are afflicted even to utmost satiety. See
Psalm. 42.3. Act. and Mon. 1457.
Holy Bradford often mused at his meat, having his hat over his eyes, from whence
came commonly plenty of tears dropping on his trencher.

Verse. 6. Thou make us a strife unto our neighbours] We have as many enemies
as neighbors, all striving to enslave us. We are crushed betwixt them as corn
is betwixt milstones.

And our enemies laugh among themselves] Make them merry in our misery, revel
in our ruins.

Verse. 7. Turn us again O God of Hoasts] See verse. 3. and observe that there it
was only; Turn us again, O God, here O God of Hoasts, and verse 19. O Lord God
of Hoasts. As the bird by much waving gathers wind under the wing, and
mounteth higher; so does faith in prayer, viresque acquirit eundo.

Verse. 8. Thou have brought a vine out of Egypt] The Church is often set forth by
this smilitude. The Rabbis say, that Solomon made a vine of gold in the
Temple. Athenaeus tells us, that the Kings of Persia sat under a golden vine
having bunches of smaragds and other stately stones. Lib. 12.
All this was nothing to Gods Vine that plant of renown, brought out of Egypt
(where it got no good, Ezekiel. 20.8) and set in a better soil.

Verse. 9. Thou preparedst room for it] Espying out a fit place to plant it in,
Ezekiel. 20.6. and making clean work before it, as some render the words,
Expurgasti coram ca.
by pulling up those bad and barren weeds the Canaanites, that might have
hindered its growth.

And did cause it to take deep root] viz. by thy digging, dressing, watering
and mounding it; as of all possessions, none requires greater care than that
of Vineyards says Cato; and there is peculiar affection in men toward the Vine
above all trees, as another observes.

Verse. 10. The hills were covered, etc.] The Israelites grew amain in wealth,
Power and multitude of men; witness their huge armies, and valiant acts,
though the Country was not above two hundred miles long, and fifty miles broad.

Verse. 11. She sent out her bough^ unto the Sea] The midland Sea.

And her branches unto the river] Euphrates. This was first done in David's
days.

Verse. 12. Why have thou then broken down her hedges?] i. e. Taken away thy
mighty hand hitherto held over her. This befell not till they degenerated into
a strange Vine, Jer. 2. and brought forth wild grapes. Isa. 5.

Verse. 13. The Boar out of the Wood] All Swine (but wild ones especially) are
vitibus inimici, says Theodoret, destructions to Vines. And Melancthon thinks
that therefore God forbad the Jews to eat Swines flesh Eo quod sues omnia
sursum deorsum vertant vastentque, because they turn up all; rooting things up
by the roots, Manl. loc. com.
as the word here signifies. Austin understands it of Vespasian, others of
Antiochus, Exvineavit. (...), Sept. Luke 1.78.
or Antichrist.

And the wild beast] The soldiers, 2 Chronicles. 25.18.

Verse. 14. Visit this Vine] Some understand it of Christ's incarnation.

Verse. 15. And the Vineyard] Vitiarium, surculum, plantulam.

Verse. 16. They perish] Scilicet palmites, and propagines, verse 10, 11.

Verse. 17. The man of thy right hand] i. e. Israel, or the Messiah.

Verse. 18. So will not we go back] A promise of gratitude, which is usually
annexed to prayers for deliverance.

Verse. 19. Turn us again] See verse 7. Prayers are like arrows of deliverance,
which would be multiplied and enlarged, 2 King. 13.17.

PSALM. LXXXI.
Upon Gittith] An Instrument brought from Gath, or used by Obed-Edom the
Gittite; or a Psalm to be sung at the vintages, i.e. at the Feast of
Tabernacles. It contains a solemn Thanksgiving (for which cause also that
Feast was instituted) with so great joy, that Plutarch took occasion
there-hence to write (but falsely) that the Jews did then keep a Feast, (...) In
sympos. gaudium cantu accendite.
or Holy Day to Bacchus.

Verse. 1. Sing aloud unto God] Be loud and large in his praises, set them forth
cheerfully, and courageously. God loves zeal in all his services.

Verse. 2. Bring hither the Timbrel] These Instruments then used in Gods Service
(as a part of the Jewish pedagogy) were types of that Spiritual joy which we
should express in holy duties, no less than if we heard the most exquisite
Music. There should be continual Music (habitual joy) in the Temple of the
Holy Ghost.

Verse. 3. Blow up the Trumpet in the new Moon] And the like at other solemn
Feasts, three whereof (all in the seventh Month to be kept) Beza thinks to be
here plainly and distinctly noted. These Feasts were a shadow of things to
come, but the body is in Christ, Col. 2.16, 17.

Verse. 4. For this was a statute] The keeping of it therefore is not arbitrary,
but necessary: Aut faciendum aut patiendum.

And a Law] Which was to be kept as the apple of the eye, Prove. 7.2.

Verse. 5. This he ordained in Joseph] Put for all Israel, as Psalm. 80.1. though
the Chaldee understands it of Joseph in person, and the next words of his
going through the Land of Egypt to gather Corn in the seven plentiful years,
and that at his first coming into Egypt, he understood not their Language.

Where I heard a Language] Idolatrous Language, say some, contrary to the
Language of Canaan: this God knew not, Isa. 19.18.
that is, liked not; Or, rather a strange foreign Language, which is not small
grievance, Jer. 5.15. Ezekiel. 2.6. 1 Corinthians. 14.11. to those especially, who
understand no otherwise than by blows, as Beasts do men. Sordidissimo
ministerio.


Verse. 6. I removed his shoulder from the burden] From the woeful slavery of
Egyptian Tyrants and Taskmasters.

His hands passed away from the pots] Or, Baskets, wherein was carried earth
for brick-clamping, and Pot-making, etc. whereunto they were so close tied that
they might not stir a foot from their daily work, till God delivered them. Some
say, that the Pyramides were built by them.

Verse. 7. Thou calledst in trouble] Their trouble called, though themselves had
been silent; I have seen, I have seen the afflictions of my people, etc. but
they cried to the Lord at the red Sea, Exodus 14.10, 15. and were delivered.

I answered thee in the secret place of thunder] i. e. In the Pillar of Cloud,
that stood betwixt the two Armies, and thundered against the Egyptians, Exodus
14.24. Confer Lam. 3.44.

I proved thee at the waters of Meribah] When thou had but newly foot out of
snare; and yet there, and then thou shewedst thy self. O thine ungratefulness!
etc. this has been thy manner from thy youth.

Verse. 8. Hear O my people, etc.] Notwithstanding thy many and mighty
provocations at Meribah, and elsewhere, I made a covenant with thee at Mount
Sinai, and gave thee right Judgments, and true Laws, good Statutes, and
Commandments, Neh. 9.13.

Verse. 9. There shall no strange god] This is the first and chief Commandment,
wherein all the rest are contained, says Luther.

Verse. 10. Open thy mouth wide, etc.] If thou be straightened it is not in me, but
in thine own bowels; he secretly taxes them for their (...) and their (...) in
prayer, their faithlesness and faint-heartedness, whereby they do deny as it
were their own prayers: Ask largely, and speed accordingly.

Verse. 11. But my people would not hearken] Here begins the Second part of
the Psalm which is objurgatory, and very suitable to the season of the year at
that Feast, that if it were a fruitful year, the Israelites might see and
acknowledge Gods goodness therein; as if otherwise, they might accuse
themselves, and not the Lord. Perplexis cogitationibus. Vat.


Israel would none] Heb. acquiesced not in me, was not well affected to me,
but had hearts full of harlotry.

Verse. 12. So I gave them up] I left them as a ship without a rudder; as an
horse without reigns to go whither they would, and do what they would. This is
a fearful Judgment, Poena rebellionis maxima.
Hos. 4.14. Romans 1.28. 2 These. 2.11, 12.

And they walked in their own counsels] To their own ruin, because they took
counsel but not of God, and covered with a covering, but not of his Spirit,
that they might add sin to sin, Isa. 30.1.

Verse. 13. O that my people had hearkened unto mee] A wish after the manner of
men; to set forth Gods great desire of our welfare, which he here utters as
it were, with a sigh and a groan.

Verse. 14. I should soon have subdued] I would have turned the scales, and made
them as much over-weight to their enemies, as they were to them.

And turned my hand, etc.] God, with a turn of his hand can overturn his
enemies, and relieve his little ones, Zach. 13.7. If he but spread forth his
hands as a swimmer spreads forth his hands to swim, he shall bring down the
pride of oppressors together, Isa. 25.11.

Verse. 15. The haters of the Lord should have submitted] Heb. Lied, that is,
yielded feigned obedience, as Psalm. 18.44.

But their time should have endured for ever] i. e. Their strength, says the
Chaldee; their tranquillity and prosperity, say others. Theodoret refers it
to the enemies thus, The time of their calamity shall endure for ever, they
shall be eternally miserable.

Verse. 16. With the finest of the wheat] Heb. With the fat or marrow of wheat,
with the choicest of picked nourishment.

And with honey, etc.] Hyperbole incomparabilis felicitatis and faecunditatis.
See Deuteronomy. 32.13. shadowing out the sweetness of the Word and Sacraments.

PSALM. LXXXII
VEers. 1. God stands in the Congregation of the Mighty] There God is present
and president by a particular providence, as Lord Paramount, and chief
Magistrate, Ut praeses Synodi. Locus ^raes^dis est medius locus in caetibus.
higher than the highest, Eccles. 5.8. Job 31.14. Ephesians. 6.9. The Etheopian
Judges, they say, do ever leave the chief seat of Judicature empty for him; and
Solomon, for like reason; calls that seat The holy place, Eccles. 8.10. There
Elohim (that is, the Judge and Avenger) stands, or sets himself, to behold
the actions and affections of Judges, and to pass a censure upon their
sentences. Good therefore was the counsel of Jehosaphat to his Judges when to
ride circuit, 2 Chronicles. 19.6. Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for man,
but for the Lord who is with you in the Judgment. Wherefore now let the fear
of the Lord your God be upon you; take heed and do it, etc. Judges should sit
in as great (though not so slavish) a fear of offending, as Olanes in the
history did upon the flayd skin of his Father Silannes nailed by Cambyses on
the tribunal, or as a Russian Judge, Turk. hist. 728.
that fears the boiling caldron, or open battocking; or the Turkish Senate,
when they think the great Turk to stand behind the Arras at the dangerous door.

He judges among the Gods] i. e. Among the Magistrates (as our Savior
interprets it, Joh. 10.34, 35.) who are called gods. First, By analogy
tanquam Deum imitantes, says Theodoret, as resembling God by having the power
of life and death. Secondly, By participation, tanquam lumina illuminata, says
Austin; as stars participate their light from the Sun; so do Rulers their
authority from the supreme Majesty. Thirdly, By deputation from God, whose
vicegerents they are, and to whom they must be accountable for their
mal-administration.

Verse. 2. How long will ye judge unjustly?] viz. Thorough a cyclopicall
contempt of Gods senerity. Ne pecces, Deus ipse videt.

Will ye represent and express God to the World as a corrupt, crooked, and
unrighteous Judge?

And accept the persons of the wicked?] Heb. Lift up their faces, and show them
more favor than others that are much honester? Barrabbas often is released, and
Christ crucified; Alter habet aequum, sed alter habebit equum, said that
partial Emperor. This man has the right on his side, but the other shall
carry the cause, for all that.

Verse. 3. Defend the poor and Fatherless] These are Gods clients, and this is
Gods counsel worthy to be written with letters of gold on the walls of all
Judicatories, as having in it better direction for a Statesman than all Lipsim
his Bee-hive, or Machiavels Spider-wed. These two Latin verses are said to be
written over the Judgment Seat in Xant. Hic locus odit amat, punit, conserv
at, honorat,
Nequitiam, pacem; crimina, jura, bones.


Verse. 4. Rid them out of the hand of the wicked] Heb. Of the turbulent, who
make a do, as the Devil does, and vex others.

Verse. 5. They know not, neither will they understand] q. d. There Is no good to
be done upon these uncircumcised vice-gods, as they may in the worst sense be
best styled; it is bootless to advise them to better, for they are set; they are
as good every whit as ever they mean to be; and as for their duty, nec
cogitant, nec curant, they neither know it, nor care to know it, but blunder on
in the dark, and are led blindling by their base lusts, which so they may
satisfy, they pass not what becomes of the weal public, Pessimi dantur, and
ruunt omnia.
but oppose with crest and breast whatsoever crosseth-their sinful designs.
Hereby they cause mighty concussions, and draw down heavy judgments, Isa.
24.18, 19.

Verse. 6. (...). A^ist. Polit. l. 3. c. 13. Niceph. l. 18. scribit summum
principem gentis. Turcicadictum fuisse Taifau i.e. f^lium D^i.
I have said ye are Gods] As verse 1. but doubly so, if good too; if they
excel both in virtue and power, as Aristotle joyneth them; I have said, is vox
potestatis constituentis, whence that of the Apostle, All power is of God, Romans
13.2.

And all of you are children of the most High] Invested (as Princes sons and
heirs are often) with part of my power, and entrusted with the administration of
mine earthly Kingdom by the exercise of vindictive and remunerative Justice.
The Chaldee paraphraseth, As the Angels of the High; and Kimchi, As the Stars,
which have dominion over these inferior bodies, Confer Job 38.7.

Verse. 7. But ye shall dye like men] Yea, if wicked, like beasts; but only for
their pillow and bolster. Super cubilia for san in honor mor^untur, quo a
bestiis differunt, sed non in morte, says Kimchi. God who had so highly
advanced such, will lay them low enough; even in the slimy valley (if not in
hell) where are many already like them, and more shall come after them, Job
21.31, 32. Our Henry the eight was told on his deathbed that he should go to
the place of Princes; which was no great comfort, if the old Proverb be true,
that Hell is paved with the Crowns of Princes, and helmets of soldiers. The
Spanish Friar used to say, there were but few Princes in hell; for why? there
were but few in all.

And fall like one of the Princes] Of the Heathen Tyrants, which are often slain
by the People, as most of the Cesars before Constantine were. Ad generum
Cereris, etc. Some of the Fathers, Arnobius, Chrysostom, Theodoret, etc.
understand it of Beelzebub and his fellows, qui acerbissimis and
exquisitissimis tormertis cruci^ntur, who are most tormented in hell, 2 Pet. 2.
Potentes potentur torquebantur. Some read it, And ye, O Princes, shall fall as
one, i. e. as others do. A necessary consideration for great ones, who are apt
to dream of an immortality, or at least to drive off the thoughts of death.

Verse. 8. Arise O God, judge the earth] Take the matter into thine own hand,
for it is but time, all things here being so ill ordered by thy substitutes;
nam alioqui prae judiciorum constupratione terra tota videtur collapsura, all
will be naught else.

For thou shall inherit all Nations] Thou Lord Jesus shall, Psalm. 2.8. Heb.
1.2. Rev. 11.15. Come therefore, yea come quickly.

PSALM. LXXXIII.
Verse. 1. Keep not thou silence O God] Ter idem dicit ad vehementiam, He says
the same thing thrice to show his earnestness. The Hebrew is, Be not silent to
thee, that is, in thine own cause, as verse 5. The Septuagint and Vulgar have
it, O God, who is like unto thee? Concurrunt magno impetu, conatu, and ardore.


Verse. 2. For let thine enemies make a tumult] Thine, because ours; for there
is a league offensive, and defensive betwixt God and his people; the Church
must therefore needs be invincible, because God is so.

Have left up the head] Being insolent and confident, Kimchi.
they bear their noses high in the air, uttering loud and lofty language; as
did Rabshaketh, sent by Sonnacherib, 2 King. 18. to which times some refer
this Psalm, as others to those of Jehosaphat, 2 Chronicles. 20.

Verse. 3. They have taken crafty counsel, etc.] They have negotiated this
league with much subtlety and solicitation, conferunt and captant confilia,
they are cruel-crafties. Malignaverunt consilium, says the Vulgar.

And consulted against thy hidden ones] Hidden under the hollow of thy hand,
under the shadow of thy wing; and therefore safe from strife of tongues or
force of hands, Psalm. 27.5. and 31.21. Commodum instituto epithetum. The Greek
renders it, Thy Saints, such as whose life is hid with Christ in God. Col.
3.3. 1 John 3.2. The same Hebrew word is used for the inward oracle of the
Temple, Ezekiel. 7.22. a type of Heaven, the Saints Country.

Verse. 4. They have said come, etc.] The wicked have their Come, Prove. 1.11. as
well as the Saints, Isa. 2.3, 5. Zach. 8.21. but for a worse purpose.

Let us cut them off] Them, by way of contempt, as not worth naming, they were
so base. The Devil and his Imps would utterly root out the Church; but that
cannot be, Jer. 31.36. Mat. 16.18.

That the name of Israel, etc.] But Israel has still a name, when Moab, Ammon,
Edom, etc. live but by fame only See Jer. 48.2.

Verse. 5. They have consulted together with one consent] Heb. With one heart,
concorditor, as if they had all but one heart. This was not unity but
conspiracy; such as is that of Papists, Rev. 17.13, 14.

They are confederate against thee] Heb. They have stricken a Covenant, viz.
with oaths and solemn ceremonies, cutting the Sacrifice in twain, Virg. Aeneid.
8.
and passing between the parts thereof, as Jer. 34.18. -- caesa jungebant
faedera porca.

Verse. 6. The Tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, etc.] Exercitu ex
variis gentibus couflato, at odds amongst themselves, and yet well agreed for a
mischief to the Church, who might ever well say as the Hare in Martial. In me
omnis terraeque aviumque marisque rapina est;
Forsitan and caeli, si canis astra tenet.


As Dogs fighting and intertearing one another, can give over and join together
to follow the harmless Hare that passes by them; so here! If Manasseh be
against Ephraim, and Ephraim against Manasseh, yet they will be both against
Judah.

And the Hagarens] Who came also of Hagar, as well as the Isamaelites; but were
a distinct people, and would be called Saracens, Saracens in Arabic is Thieves.
from Sarah the freewoman: for honor sake, as if the Promises made to Abraham
and Sarah had belonged to them. Ptolomy makes mention of the Saracens, and
places in Arabia the seat of the Hagarens; where there is also a City called
Agra, of Hagar, likely. Aben-Ezra says they came of Agar, by another husband.
The Chaldee calls them Hungarians.

Verse. 7. Gebal and Ammon and Amalec] Sic enarrae and enumerat inimieos december
conglobatos. Answerable whereunto were the ten Kings of Christendom, Ezekiel.
27.9.
who gave their power to the beast. Gebal might be the inhabitants of Gabel, a
City of Phenicia says Stephanus, or of Syria, says Strabo, which Volaterran
says was called Gibel, in his time, but anciently Biblus, See Josh. 13.5.

Verse. 8. Assure also is joined with them] The Chaldee paraphraseth Sennacherib,
also the King of Ashur, etc. So does the Turk, with the Churches enemies;
howbeit Italy is the mark he shoots at; and the Protestants have the
happiness (as also America) to be further out of his way, and no part of his
present aim, for the greatest part of them.

Verse. 9. Do unto them as unto the Medianites] And how that was, see Judge. 7.
and 8. and Judge. 4. Preces sunt bombar de and instrumenta bellica
Christianorum, says Luther.

Verse. 10. Who perished at Endor] A place in the Tribe of Manasseh near unto
that ancient River, the River Kison, Judge. 17.1 Sam. 28.

They became as dung] They lay unburied, rotted above ground, and were spread as
compost upon soil.

Verse. 11. Make their Nobles like Oreb and like Zee^] Oreb signifies a Crow,
Zeeb a Wolf, Zeboh a cutthroat, Zalmunna a forbidder of shadow, or quiet to
his subjects; fit names for Tyrants, and persecuters of Gods people.

Verse. 12. Let us take to our selves the houses of God] Covetous Impropriatours
and Oppressors have learned this language. Possidebant Papistae, possident
Rapistae, says One wittily.

Verse. 13. Captia card ^orum.
O my God, make them like a wheel] Heb. Like a rouling thing, such as is
thistle-down, says R. Solomon. Gr. like a top, Torque illos in modum trochi,
whirle them about as boys do their tops.

As the stubble] As before he had brought examples, so here similitudes to show
what he would have done to the enemy.

Verse. 14. As the fire burns a wood] Maxim quando a vento flabellatur, when
blown up by a feirce wind, it soon turns a wood into a waste.

And as the flame sets the mountains on fire] Those sulphury mountains, such
as Aetna, Vesuvius, Peitramala, a mountain in the highest part of the
Apennines, which perpetually burns, Il Mercu^io Ialico 178.
say travelers.

Verse. 15. So persecute them with thy tempest] Turbina cos, that they may stand
or stay no where.

And make them afraid, etc.] So fright them with thy heavy judgments, that all
their wit and courage wherewith they should help themselves, may be
expectorated.

Verse. 16. Fill their faces with shame] By confounding their confidences, and
blasting their designs. They promised themselves a triumph, but let them have
the canvass.

That they may seek thy name O Lord] Ut in viti cogantur quis sit tam potens
Jehovah rogitare, that they may even in despite of their heads, be compelled
to inquire after thee. It is storied of Sennacherib, that after the destruction
of his huge army at Jerusalem, demanding of some about him what might be the
reason that the unresistable God of Heaven so favored the Jewish Nation as he
had found by sad experience? Bib. Castal, Tabul.
answer was given that Abraham from whom they defended, sacrificed unto him his
only Son, which purchased this Protection to his posterity. If that will win
him, says He, I will spare him two of my sons, to procure him to be on my
side; which Sharezer and Adrammelech his sons hearing of, prevented their own
deaths by his.

Verse. 17. Let them be confounded, etc.] This and the following verse, are an
exposition of the former verse. The Rabbines have a saying nulla est objectio
in Lege, que non habet solutionem in latere. The Scripture is its own
interpreter.

Verse. 18. That men may know that thou whose name alone is Jehovah] The
Essentiator, Isa. 44.6. with Act. 17.25. Rev. 1.4.8. The Jews pronounce not
this name at all, but use Adonai or Elohim for it. The first among the
Christians that pronounced it was Petrus Galatinus, following the pronunciation
of the Syriacks and Greeks. Genebrard will have it pronounced Jahue, and
bitterly enveyeth against Beza, and others as prophaners of Gods name, who call
God Jova, or Jehova, vocabulo novo, says he, barbaro, fictitio, irreligioso
and Jovem Gentilium redolen^e. It is very likely that of this holy and reverend
name of God, the Gentiles called their greatest God Jove and Jupiter, Aug. de
conse^s. Evang. l. 1. c. 22.
that is, Jah-pater. Pausanias also tells us that the Poets thus sang unto
him, (...). And Varro the learned of the Romans thought. Jove to be the God
of the Jews. But he and all men should have known, as here, that Jehovah is God
alone; and so have sought to the Jews (of whom alone was salvation, Joh. 4.22.)
for better understanding in the things of Gods Kingdom; acknowledging him to
be the most High above all the earth, and contemning minutulos istos deos modo
Jovem sibi propitium haberet, as another heathen said.

PSALM. LXXXIV.
A Psalm] Of the same subject with the forth second, and made when David was
banished either by Saul or Absalom; or else when busied abroad in his wars, 2 Samuel 8. and so, debarred from the use of Gods public ordinances.

Verse. 1. How amiable are shy Tabernacles] viz. For thy Words lake that is
there preached, and thy worships there performed. The Protestants at Lions in
France called their place for public meetings to serve God, Hom. 36. a^ 1 Cor.
14.
Paradise, Chrysostom calls it the place of Angels and Archangels, the
Kingdom of God, yea Heaven it self. Another calls it, The heavenly Exchange
betwixt God and his people; they present dury, he conferres mercy. Luther
says, he would not live in Paradise without the Ordinances; as with them he
could frame to live in Hell it self: And a small village with a godly Pastor,
and a good people in it, is an earthly Paradise, says He. If that Italian
Martyr could date his letter From the delectable Orchard of the Leonine prison,
what may we think of the free use of the ordinances? what of Heaven? nam facile
literatransfertur ad Spiritum.

Verse. 2. My soul longeth] As she did, who said, Give me Children or else I
dye. His soul once longed for the waters of the well of Bethlehem, but not so
earnestly as now to draw waters with joy out of those wells of salvation.

My heart and my flesh] Ut sit sanctitus in cord, and sanitas in corpore. And
for obtaining of this, whole David cries aloud, as a child when hungry cries
every whit of him, hands, feet, face, all cry; and then the Mother flings by
all, then she flies and out-runs her self: So here; The desires of the
Righteous shall be satisfied, Prove. 10.24.

Verse. 3. Yea the sparrow] Avis communissima, haunteth about houses, builds
about windows, and there chirpeth. The Heb word ken for a nest has the first
letter bigger than the rest, to note Gods providence in teaching birds to
build. Exclamatio pathetica ex abrupto. Trem.


And the Swallow a nest for her self, etc.] She has her name in Hebrew from
her liberty to fly boldly, and to nestle in men's chimneyes, Prove. 26.2.

Even thine Altars] Or, Oh thine Altars! (so some read it) by a passionate
exclamation, importing strongest desires after them. The want of Gods
Ordinances should pinch us to the heart.

Verse. 4. Blessed are they that dwell in thy house] viz. Those Meniall-servants
of thine, the Priests and Levites, who have their lodgings near thee, and their
employment about thee. This is still the happiness of Gods Ministers, whose
holy function and calling (both in the preparation to it, and execution of it)
leads them to God, and holds them with him.

They will be still praising thee] As having hearts full of Heaven, and
consciences full of comfort. There cannot but be music in the Temple of the
holy Ghost.

Verse. 5. Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee] i.e. Who is enabled by
thee, both in body and mind, to come from the place of his abode to the solemn
feasts.

In whose heart are the ways of them] Here the old translation, In whose heart
are thy ways, is far better. i.e. As he brings his body to the Ordinances,
so he has thy ways or laws engraven in his heart.

Verse. 6. Who passing thorough the valley of Baca] That is, of tears, say some,
(...), Sept.
of Mulberry-trees say others; the one are moist, the other use to grow in more
dry places. Betwixt them both, they may serve, says One, to make up a more
complete emblem of this miserable World, made up of woes and wants. In hoc
exilio says Bernard, in hoc ergastulo, in hac peregrinatione, in hac valle
lachrymarum, etc.

Make it a Well] They are as cheerful in their travel to Gods house, as if
they had plenty of water all the way. Finis edulcat media, the joy of the Lord
is their strength, whereby they are carried on an end, as they say, to their
journeys end the joyful preconceit of appearing before God in Zion; allaying
their great thirst.

Verse. 7. Pergunt tarmatini. Beza
They go from strength to strength] i.e. Lustily and constantly, turma turmae
subinde sese adjungente, one company coming this way, and another that, out of
their several parishes, and so they grow stronger, and go more comfortably on
together. Some render it, de doctrina in doctrinam, vel de academia in
academiam; they grow til they come to a perfect knowledge of God.

Every one of them in Zion appears before God] And then think their pains
though never so great, well bestowed, though then they saw Gods face, but
obscurely in the dark glass of the ceremonies. Popish pilgrims though used
hardly, and loose much of their estates, yet satisfy themselves in this, I
have that I came for, viz. the sight of a dumb Idol. What then should not we
then suffer to see God in his ordinances, etc.?

Verse. 8. O Lord God of Hoasts hear my prayer] Satisfy mine earnings,
pantings, and inquietations of mind after the liberty of they Sanctuary, verse.
2. These very desires he calls prayers.

Verse. 9. Behold] Not only Hear, see Psalm. 34.15. with the Note.

Look upon the face of thine anointed] Christi, cujus festina adventum, says
Kimchi; do me good for Christ's sake.

Verse. 10. For a day in thy Courts] Every Flower has its sweetness: so has
every holy duty its comfort.

I had rather be a Door-keeper] As the Korites were, to whom this Psalm was
committed; and for whose encouragement this might be spoken. A Doorkeeper is
first in, last out; so would David be in holy assemblies. Tardy hearers would
be loath to beg this office out of his hand.

In the tents of wickedness] Tentoriis vexationis, Kimchi.

Verse. 11. For the Lord God is a Sun and Shield] An universal All-sufficient
and satisfactory good, proportionate to our necessities.

The Lord will give grace and glory] One would think that were enough, yea but
then here is more than enough, No good thing will he withold, etc. and thence
is David's desire, so to be about him.

Verse. 12. O Lord of Hosts, etc.] Conclusio Epiphonematica.

PSALM. LXXXV.
Verse. 1. Lord, thou have been favorable, etc.] Gods free grace and favor is
fitly premised, as the Fountain and Mother of all the following Mercies. This
is that other Book, Rev. 20 12. that has our names in it, and our pardon.

Thou have brought back the captivity of Jacob] Of old from Egypt, and alate
from the Philistines; who after Saul's death miserably tyrannized over Israel,
till David delivered them. Some hold that this Psalm was composed at the end of
the Babylonish Captivity. Others conceive it may be a prayer for the conversion
of the Gentiles, who are brought in speaking, the whole Psalm throughout.

Verse. 2. Thou have for given the iniquity, etc.] This is worthily mentioned as
a main mercy, as a chief fruit of Free Grace.

Thou have covered all their sin] That, that filthy thing may be no longer an
eyesore unto thee. In the Original there are Six Homoioteleuta, which is an
elegancy not to be englished.

Verse. 3. Thou have taken away all thy wrath] Heb. Thou have gathered it, thou
have recollected it, that we might not bear it; when Sin is once remitted,
Wrath is soon removed.

Thou have turned thy self from the fierceness, etc.] Here are six Hasts
drawing in the next Turn, verse. 4. God has, and therefore God will, is a
strong Medium of hope, if not a demonstration of Scripture-Logicks. See 2 Cor.
1.10.

Verse. 4. Turn us, O God of our salvation] Turn us, and we shall be turned; do
as thou ever have done, for thou art Jehovah, thou changest not, but art
yesterday, today, and the same for ever.

And cause thine anger, etc.] I abefacta iram tuam erga nos.

Verse. 5. Will thou he angry with us for ever?] Dilato Christo two vel tuo
adventu? Such expostulations mixed with faith are Vis Deo grata, as says
Tertullian, such as God is well pleased with.

Verse. 6. With thou not revive us again?] Who for present are all amort, as it
were, free among the dead? free of that company?

That thy people may rejoice in thee] A joyless life is a lifeless life, Mortis
habet vices quae trahitur vita gemitibus.

Verse. 7. show us thy mercy, O Lord] Thy fatherly mercy, (...).

And grant us thy salvation] Thy Christ, and our Jesus, Luke 2.30.

Verse. 8. I will hear what God the Lord will speak] I will not repine, but
listen what answer God gives to my prayer, and patiently wait a good issue of
my troubles.

For he will speak peace unto his people] viz. by his Promises, and by his
Providence.

And to his Saints] For all Gods people are righteous ones, Isa. 60.21.
justified and sanctified, 1 Cor. 6.11.

But let (...) them turn again do folly] i.e. to the ways of the world, and of
(...) real son lest they smart for their rashness, and God (...) to their words
again.

Verse. 9. Surely his salvation is nigh them, etc.] Though they be so (...) with
tears, that they cannot see it and so discouraged, that they have even done
looking for it. Luke ^^ 7,^.

That glory may dwell in our Land,] The Fathers has by salvation and glory
dwelling with man, understand Christ, Job. 1.26.

Verse. 10. Jam fides and pax, and honor pudorque Priscu^, and neglect^^ redire
virtus Audet; apparetque beata pleno Copia cornu. Horat. Iren. Aug.
Mercy and (...) are met together] (...) (his) Mercy is ever ^^^^^ded by (...)
conjunction his people there is a (...) and (...) ^^^^tion of Graces, 2 Pet.
^.^. and this is an effect of Christ Kingdom in m^^^ (...) Romans 14.17.

Righteousness and peace have killed each other] Have friendly saluted, in
allusion to the manner of the Eastern Nations. See Isa. 12.17. Psalm. 119.169.

Verse. 11. Truth shall spring out of the earth] i. e. Heaven and (...) shall be
(...) both of truth and righteousness. Many understand all concerning Christ.
See J^^. 3.13. Others, concerning extraordinary plenty of all good things.

Verse. 12. Yea the Lord shall give that which is good] Yea h^st of all, viz.
his holy Spirit ( Luke 11.13. with Matthew 7.11.) with a largess of outward
comforts.

Verse. 13. Righteousness shall go before him] Men shall walk before God in
holinels and righteousness all the days of their lives, Luke 1.75, they shall
not rest in outward blessings, verse. 12. or be satisfied with such low things,
but be led up thereby to the care of higher.

And shall set us in the way of his steps] So that we shall go an upper (and
^^^^fore a better) way, Prove. 15.24. having our feat where other men's heads
are: and so departing from Hell beneath, which (...) gapeth for the unrighteous.

PSALM. LXXXVI.
A Prayer] Left for a form, for a help to devotion, as was also, Psalm. 1^2.
Title.

Verse. 1. Bow down thine (...), O Lord] As the careful Physician does to his
feeble Patient: so Basil glosseth here.

For I am poor, and needy] Having nothing to live on but what my friends
privily send me, or what I can get by boot-haling from the Lords enemies, 1 Samuel 30.26.

Verse. 2. Preserve my soul, for I am holy] Or, a (...), a Saint, merciful, such
an one as upon whose heart the tender mercies of the Almighty (...) forth
abundantly, do leave a compassionate frame. David had the Divine Nature
transfused into him, he was holy, as God is holy; and merciful, as God is
merciful (in quality though not in equality) but all of free grace; and this he
plead^^^ for his own safety.

Save thy servant] Serva servum tuum, thy devoted servant, and not thy
beneficiary only.

Verse. 3. Be merciful unto me] Lest any should by the former (...) (I (...))
suspect him to be a merit-monger, he beggeth mercy, with instancy and constancy
of request.

Verse. 4. Rejoice the soul of thy servant] True and solid joy enters (...), by
the door of servent prayer. Pray that your joy may be fell.

I lift up my soul] In prayer, Psalm. 25.1 and confident (...) of an (...)
carrying return thereof (...). 24.^^.

Verse. 5. For thou Lord are good, (...).] Lord, I am ^ell, (...) are Heaven,
said God by prayer.

And plenteous in mercy] Both to (...) sin, and to give good Hos. 14.^.

Verse. 6. Give ear, O Lord etc.] The hearing of our suits is earnestly to be
sought and reckoned among our chiefest (...).

Verse. 7. In the day of my trouble, etc.] Gods Petitioners must pray and
believe, and believe and pray (...). David had said verse ^ God is man in mercy
to all that call upon him. Here he (...) and con^^^th, (...) in the day of my
trouble will call upon him, therefore he will answer me.

Verse. 8. Among the Gods] Whether deputed or reputed.

There is none like unto thee] Either in essence, or in operation. See (...)
15.11.

Verse. 9. As Nations whom thou have (...) come, etc.] I were (...) they should,
Rev. 4. ult. it is to be hoped they shall, Isa. 11. and 43. not by ^hange of
^race, but (...), respon^ing their irreligions, and yielding unto Christ the
(...) of faith. Some understand this Text of that general Assembly at the
(...).

Verse. 10. For thou are gr^^^] Great is the Lord without quantity, good without
quality, everlasting without time, omni present without place, containing all
things without extent; within all things, and contained of nothing; without all
things, and sustained of nothing, etc. Now the least (...) of this knowledge is
worth all the gleams of human wisdom.

And do wondrous things] The Schools have laid down a threefold way of
knowing God; First, Negation of Imperfections. Secondly, Affirmation of
Perfections. Thirdly, Causation of great works.

Verse. 11. Teach me thy way] David knew much of God, and yet he desires to be
taught more; delivering himself up to Gods discipline, and saying as once Solon
did (...).

Unite my heart to fear thy name] i. e. To serve thee with simplicity and godly
(...) 2 Cor. ^^ cleav^^ to thee with full purpose of heart, Act. 11.23. and
attending upon thee without distraction, 1 Cor. 7.35. As thou a^ God alone (
verse 10.) so let my heart be towa^d thee alone. Behold I find it divided,
disjoynted, and so disabled for duty (for anima disper sa fit minor) Oh do thou
unite it I beseech thee, giving me that one heart thou have promised, until we
all come unto that oneness of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God
unto a perfect man, etc. Ephesians. 4.13.

Verse. 12. I will praise thee] While he prayed, he found his prayer answered;
and therefore thus breaks forth into praises.

Verse. 13. (...) delivered my soul from the lowest hell] That is from deadly
and desperate dangers. Some understand it of the damnation of hell which David
had deserved by his sins. The Rabbines gloss is, A loco adulter is appropriate.

Verse. 14. O God, the proud] The strangers some read it (by the change of a
letter in the original) who are commonly cruel.

And the assemblies of violent men] Nebulonum, some render it, sturdy varlets,
(...).

Verse. 15. But thou O Lord art a God full, etc.] These are part of those
thirteen Attributes of Almighty God, set down and proclaimed by himself, Exodus
34.6. Middoth the Rabbines call them, that is, Properties.

Verse. 16. O turn unto mee] Or, Look toward me; the life of a believer
consists in the light of Gods countenance.

Give thy strength unto thy servant] Master, pray lend me your hand, says the
servant to his Master,, when he wants help.

(...)] q. d. I was both in thy house, came religious Parents, etc. therefore
do me good for their sakes at least, as Ismael was blessed for Abraham's.

Verse. 17. Show me a token for good] Make me King as thou have promised; and
mean while to deliver me, that my greatest adver^^^^, may be convinced of
their malice and madness. At the death of some tokens were flown (...), for
instance (...), and the Sun ^hope of a da^^ cloud so full, Act. and Mon 1544,
1547. 1398.
that he was forced to look another way.

PSALM. LXXXVII.
A Psalm or song] Made, likely, by David, after that he had settled the Ark in
Mount Sion, 2 Samuel 6. and understood that the Temple should be built in Mount
Moriah; In which two mountains (or rather one mountain with two tops) the
Rabbines say that this Psalm was composed; and thereunto they draw the next
words, His foundation, or the argument of this Psalm, is in and of those holy
Mountains. But this seems not to be the sense.

Verse. 1. His foundation is in the holy Mountains] Which cannot be removed, but
abide for ever, Psalm. 125.1. Some read it, The foundation thereof, viz. of the
Temple, but especially of the Church universal that spiritual Temple (built
of living stones by God the best Architect, Christ himself being the chief
cornerstone) is in the holy Mountains: For out of Zion went forth the law, and
the word of the Lord from Jerusalem; which is therefore called the
Mother Church, and (...), the chief Church, the root of the Gentile-Churches,
Romans 11. Damasc. l. 4. c. 13.
the conversion whereof is here foretold, verse 4. and perpetual happiness
promised.

Verse. 2. The Lord loves the gates of Zion] Nothing but his mere love moved
him to make choice of it, above all other places there to declare his power,
presence, and goodness. He first chose it for his love, and then loved it for
his choice; and so he does his Church.

Verse. 3. Glorious things are spoken of thee] Dicta and praedicta, told and
foretold of thee, Heb. in thee, sc. by the holy Prophets, especially concerning
the Christian Church. See Isa. 40. to the end of that Prophecy. Nihil
honorificum non praedicatur de te; and nihil praedicatur dete quin sit
honorificentissimum. Jun.


Thou City of God] The God of glory, Act. 7.1. the great King, Mat. 5.35. the
only potentate, 1 Timothy 6.15. who makes his Church the place of his residence,
etc.

Selah] O rem dignam perpetua admiratione, O wonderful!

Verse. 4. I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon] Rahab is Egypt, and so
called for its strength, and pride. Babel the chief City of the Babylonians.
These were deadly enemies to Jerusalem, which was ground betwixt them as
betwixt a pair of Milstones, but they shall be reckoned hereafter, says God,
among my domestics, among those that know me, or rather are known of me. See
Isa. 19.19, 21, 25. 1 Pet. 5.13.

Behold Philistia] The Philistines were ever bitter enemies to the Israelites,
but shall be converted and become children of the Church. See Isa. 54.1. and
44.5.

And Tyre] Which shall leave heaping and hoarding, and employ her Merchandise
to feed and cloth Gods Saints. Isa. 23.18. Act. 21.3, 4.

With Aethopia] Heb. Cush, of Cush, the son of Ham, their Father and founder,
Genesis 10.6. Aethiopians they were called from their burnt faces. The Eunuch
received the Gospel, and published it, Act. 8. the Christian faith was
professed among them, as it is thought, from the Apostles time; though now, for
above an hundred years, they have again forsaken it.

This man was born there] Natus, id est renatus in illa. The men of these
several and other Countries were born, that is, born a new, and so made
free-denisons of the new Jerusalem, fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the
household of God, Ephesians. 2.19.

Verse. 5. And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her] i.
e. Converted; and so a daily accession made to the Church of Christ, as was by
Peter's ^ermon, etc. and now so many Nations; Behold the World is gone after
him, said those envious Pharisees, Joh. 12.19. and the Papists grudge as much
at the late glorious Reformation begun by Luther, wherein so many rejoice, and
shall do to all eternity. Bucholcerus blesses God that he was born in the
days, and was bred under the discipline of holy Melancthon Luthers colleague,
Divisae his operae, sed men's fuit unica; pavit
Ore Lutherus oves, flore Melanethen apes.


Beatus Ludovicus would be called Ludovicus de Pissiaco, rather than take
greater titles, because there he became a Christian. He thought no birth to a
new birth in Christ; no parentage to that of God to his Father, the Church to
his Mother, Christ to his elder Brother, etc. Some apply this text to the
places of holy men's birth, and tell us, that he loves the very ground his
servants tread on, the very air they first breath in, their walls are
continually before him, Isa. 49.16. he thinks the better of the houses where
they dwell.

And the highest himself shall establish her] So that the gates of Hell shall
not unsettle her. Other states and Polities have their times and their turns,
their rise and their ruin; not so the Church.

Verse. 6. The Lord shall count when he writes up the people.] When he makes
his Cense-book (called the writing of the house of Israel, Ezekiel. 13.9. the
Lords book of remembrance, Mal. 3.16. the Register of the living in Jerusalem.
Isa. 4.3.) he shall muster them in the roll of his soldiers, number them in
the catalogue of his Citizens, call them in the nomenclatura of his Disciples,
etc. A glorious privilege surely.

As well the singers as the players, etc.] There shall be an exuberancy of joy
in the holy Ghost, the only comfortable soul-ravishing music, far beyond that
of the material Temple.

All my springs are in thee] i. e. All my thoughts run upon thee, with
greatest; delight; My eyes are wholly fixed upon thee, Calvin. R. Solomon.
so some read it: Others, My bowels are in thee, making these to be the words
of the Psalmist. But methinks they do better that make them to be the words of
God, promising plenty of grace and comfort to his people, as from ever-flowing
overflowing fountains.

PSALM. LXXXVIII.
A Song or Psalm] Psalmus totus luctuosus, a doleful ditty beginning and
ending with complaints; and therefore sung in the primitive times, among other
penitential Psalms, at the public confession of persons excommunicated.

Upon Mahalath Leannoth] A musical instrument sounding heavily as a shaulm
does; and therefore called Infirmity, for humbling, or for Antiphonies. A fit
title.

Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite] i.e. The instruction of Heman, who was a very
wise man, 1 King. 4.31. descended of Zerah the son of Judah, 1 Chronicles. 2.4. and
thence called the Ezrahite, Brother to Ethan who penned the next Psalm. 1 Chronicles. 2.6. Nobile par fratrum.

Verse. 1. O Lord God of my salvation] This is the only one expression of his
faith found in this whole Psalm; and it must be understood that he thus
believed and prayed, as here, and verse 2, when he was at worst, and most
despairingly complained.

I have cried day and night before thee] Though in such a state as they were,
Act. 27.20. when neither Sun nor Star appeared, yet he cast anchor, and prayed
still for day.

Verse. 2. Let my prayer come before thee] He did not cast out brutish and wild
complaints and moans in misery, as it is natural for people to do, but poured
forth his soul into Gods blessed bosom, and now prays an answer.

Verse. 3. For my soul is full of trouble] Hypotyposis hominis luctuosissime
affecti. Here we have the lively picture of a man under bitter affliction.
Extraordinary wise he was, and extraordinary troubles he had. None out of hell
suffer more than Gods dearest children. This good man felt himself in the
suburbs of hell, as it were.

And my life draws nigh unto the grave] Or, Unto hell; The same word
signifies both, because death is hells harbinger; and would be so to the
^^ect, but for Christ.

Verse. 4. I am counted with them, etc.] I am looked upon as irrecoverable,
given up for desperate. Conclamatum est.

I am as a man that has no strength] A man no man; weak as water, (...).

Verse. 5. Free among the dead] Free of that company, A mundo manumissus.
one of the Many among the Manes, or Ghosts; a free denizon of that society, of
that moiety of mankind that are dead. Yea, I am mortuorum minimus, as R. Jonah
renders it, according to the Arabic.

Like the stain that lie in the grave] That are thrown on heaps into a pit, as
after a field fought. R. David.


Whom thou remembrest no more] As to this present world, and as it way seem to
others, with whom out fo sight, out of mind, dead folk are soon forgotten.
Varro thinks Lethum death, has its name (...), from forgetfulness; because
they which have now forgotten all the world, should soon be forgotten of the
world.

And they are cut off from thine hand] Thy providence over them in matters
belonging to life is at an end.

Verse. 6. Thou have laid me in the lowest pit] In cisterna infimbrum, in the
deepest dungeon, in lutoso lacu. such as Jeremy was cast into, chap. 37.

In the deeps] In voragin^bus, out of which none escapes, nothing can be boyed
up, as they call it.

Verse. 7. Thy wrath lyo^b hard upon mee] So it did upon David, Psalm. 32.3. but
especially upon the Son of David, the Lord Christ, of whose sufferings these
were but types; or as chips of his cross.

And thou have afflicted me with all thy waves] But all this while it is thy
doing, and that carries comfort in it.

Verse. 8. Thou have put away mine acquaintance, etc.] Job and David complain of
the like misery. Optimum solatium sodalitium; but woe to him that is alone.

I am shut up] Miserably inclaved in this forlorn comfortless condition, a
perpetual prisoner.

Verse. 9. Lord, I have called daily upon thee] Which he would not have done, if
he had cast away his confidence; for how shall they call upon him, on whom they
have not believed, Romans 10? The Saints when they want the Sun, yet they have
the day star in their hearts.

Verse. 10. Will thou show wonders to the dead?] Will thou delay to deliver me
till I am dead, and then raise me again by a miracle, that I may praise thee?
But he should have considered, that God neither needs our poor praises, not
can his help ever come too late.

Shall the dead arise] Heb. The Giants, that is, those that are swallowed up of
death, as the Giants were of the deluge.

Verse. 11. Shall thy loving kindness, etc.] The same again, and verse 12. a
third time, pro more delentium. See Psalm. 6.5. and 30.9.

Verse. 12. In the land of forgetfulness] So the state and place of the dead is
called, and why, see the Note on verse 5.

Verse. 13. But unto thee have I cryed] O condescend to thy poor crying creature
in extremity.

In the morning] See the Note on Psalm. 5.3.

Verse. 14. Lord why castest thou off, etc.] Luther says of himself, Just. Jon.
Ep. ad Melan.
that after his conversion he lay three days in desperation. And afterward, he
sometimes suffered such desertions, ut nec calor, nec sanguis, nec sensus, nec
vox superesset, says an eyewitness.

Verse. 15. I am afflicted, etc.] He was brought up in the School of
temptations, and kept in this form from his youth. He was put soon to it, and
so deep lessons had he set him, that he had like to have lost his wits. I am
distracted, says he, I am held upon the wheel.

Verse. 16. Thy foirce wrath, etc.] As rivers of brimston.

Have cut me off] Multis excisionibus, ideoque duplicatur Tau.

Verse. 17. They compassed me about] As the water compasses the earth like a
girdle.

Verse. 18. Lover and friend, etc.] See verse 8. and mark how mournfully he
concludes; as does also the Church, Lam. ^. ult.

PSALM. LXXXIX.
MAschil of Ethan the Ezrahite] Who having outlived Solomon, and seen both the
defection of the Ten Tribes from the House of David, and the woeful work made by
Shishack King of Egypt in the Kingdom of Judah, 2 Chronicles. 12. composed this
Psalm (as it may seem) and left it for an erudisive, or instruction to all
succeeding Ages what to do in such dismal changes and concussions. That
Jew-Doctor mentioned by Aben-Ezra was more nice than wise, who would neither
read nor hear this Psalm, Quia videtur dura de Deo proferre, because it seems
to speak hardly of God, verse. 39.

Verse. 1. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord] Gods Mercies moved him to
promise, his faithfulness binds him to perform; Ethan promises to celebrate
both, were the times never so bad, their case never so calamitous.

I will make known thy faithfulness] Which yet I am sometimes moved to make
question of. Thus the Psalmist insinuates before he complains, Vt faclendum
docent Rhetores in causis invidiosis; wherein he shows himself a right
Rhetorician.

Verse. 2. For I have said] I believed, therefore have I spoken it, I dare say
it shall be so, because thou have said it (so the Greek here has it) what God
says we may write upon it, because all the words of his mouth are in
righteousness, neither is there any thing froward or perverse in them, Prove.
8.8.

Mercy shall be built up for ever] Till the top-stone be laid, and judgment
be brought forth into victory, Mat. 12.20. the sure mercies of David fail not.

Thy faithfulness shall thou establish in the heavens] Or, with the very
heavens; that is, so sure as they are established. If that Martyr could say,
The Heavens shall sooner fall than I will forsake the truth I have learned; how
much more may we say so of Gods unfaileable faithfulness? See verse. 33.

Verse. 3. I have made a Covenant with my chosen] i.e. With Christ (who is Gods
elect one, Isa. 42.1.) and in him with all his people, Ephesians. 1.4.

I have sworn unto David] The Father and Figure of Christ, who is frequently
called David, and is here chiefly to be understood. O happy we, for whose sake
God has sworn, says Tertullian! and O most wretched, if we believe him not
thus swearing!

Verse. 4. Thy Seed will I establish for ever] David's for a long time, but
Christ's for ever and aye.

And build up thy throne to all generations] Christ's Kingdom has no end, Isa.
9.7. Luke 1.33. This is very comfortable. The Jews understanding this promise
of David's Kingdom, have often attempted the restoration of it; but in vain, and
to the ruin of their Nation.

Verse. 5. And the heavens shall praise thy Wonders] Heb. Thy Miracle, viz. in
their circumgyration (which shows a first mover) in their embroidery,
influences, etc. yielding matter and occasion of praise. And thus, All thy
Works praise thee, O Lord, but thy Saints bless thee, Psa. 145.10. and so by
Heavens here we may understand the Angels of Heaven (as they are called, Mat.
24 36.) as by the Congregation of Saints, the Church universal in heaven and
earth, by whom God is highly praised for the Covenant of Grace.

Verse. 6. For who in the heaven can be compared, etc?] Thou far transcendest
the brightest Cherub, all whose excellency is but derivative, a drop of thine
Ocean, a spark of thy flame.

Who among the Sons of the mighty] Inter chores Angelorum, says the Chaldee;
What Angel, what Man?

Verse. 7. God is greatly to be feared in the assembly, etc.] Heb. Daunting
terrible in the socret of the Saints very much. The holy Angels make their
addresses unto him with greatest reverence, and self-abasements; for they know
that he humbles himself to behold things in heaven, Psalm. 113. How much more
then should we set our selves to serve him with reverence and godly fear, since
our God is a consuming fire? Heb. 12.28, 29.

Verse. 8. Who is a strong Lord, like unto thee] Heb. Who is like thee, mighty
Jab? This is to magnify God, when we get above all Creatures, in our
conceptions of him.

Or to thy faithfulness (...) out thee.] those that are round about thee, or
thou art full of faithfulness.

Verse. 9. Thou (...) the raging of the sea] That it overwhelm not the earth;
this work of Gods Power is often celebrated as well it may, all things
cinfide^^^.

Verse. 10. Than have broken Rahab in (...)] i. e. which is called Rahab. for it

thy Power and thou maintainest them by the Provide^^^ thou do whatsoever
thou will in both, Psalm. 115.3.

As for the World, etc.] See Psalm. 24. (...).

Verse. 12. Tabor and Hermon] That is, the West and East of Judea but put here
for the West and East of the World; Judea was the World of the World, as Athe^s
the Greece of Greece, as Solon the Epitome of Athens.

Verse. 13. Thou have a mighty arm] Men should therefore both tremble before
God, and trust in him. 1 Pet. 2.6.

Strong is thy hand] Even thy left hand, q. d. tu polles utraque manu, thou
have both hands alike powerful.

Verse. 14. Justice and Judgment are the ^^bitation (or basis) of thy (...)]
these are the supporters, and pillars.

Mercy and Truth, etc.] These are the forerunners, or satellites; I should
much fear Justice and Judgment, says Austin, were it not that Mercy and Truth
comfort me: Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ, Joh^.

Verse. 15. Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound] Jubilatio^^^, the
sound of thy Word, the free use of thine Ordinances; serving thee with
cheerfulness, and giving thee thanks with exaltation of hea^^^ and rapture of
spirit, Scias unde gau^^ quod verb^^ explicate (...) possis, says A^sti^s,
Accipa quod se^^^ antequam (...), faith Cyprian, writing to Donatur, concerning
the joy of his Conversion.

They shall walk, O Lord in the light of thy (...)] In the fear of the Lord,
and in the comforts of the holy Ghost.

Verse. 16. In thy name shall they rejoy (...) a day] Or, every day. Bonis
semper ferie, (...), says Di^genes in Plutarch. God crowns the Calendar of
good men's lives with many fe^tivals.

Verse. 17. For thou art the glory of thew strength] And hence it is that they
are filled to pfull with comfort, and do over-abound exceedingly with joy in
all their tribulation, 2 Cor. 7.4.

Verse. 18. For the Lord is our defence] Heb. our shield; the body cannot be
wounded, but through the shield.

And the holy one of (...) our King] How then can any one cry aloud? Mich. 4.9.

Verse. 19. Then thou spakest in Vision to thy holy one] i. e. to Samuel thy
Priest, and Prophet ^ 1 Samuel 16.12.) one of those few that lived and dyed with
glory.

the Angels, Heb. 1.

My God] This is the Bee-hive of heavenly honey.

and 33.20, 21.

Verse. 29 His seed also, etc.] This is chiefly mean of christ and his Kingdom.

And his (...) as the days of Heaven] i.e. As the Kingdom of Heaven,

And walk not in my Judgements] If they fall into sins of omission, and shoot
short. Where note, that every (...), and dis-obedience (that is, every
commission and omission) receives a just recompense of reward, Heb 2.2.

Verse. 31. If they break my (...)] Heb. If they (...) or make void; q.d. be

Verse. 34. My Covenant I will not break] Heb. I will not propham my Covenant,
though they have profaned my statutes verse. 31.

Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips] But will pardon their
failings, and cause them to keep my Commandments.

Verse. 35. Once have I sworn by mine Holinesse] Which is as deep an oath as I
know how to take; for my holiness is my self, who am most holy, and the
fountain of all holiness. By this I have sworn once, that is, once for all,
immobiliter, immutabiliter.

Verse. 36. His seed shall endure for ever] Christ shall see his seed, he shall
prolong his days; and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands,
Isa. 53.10. filiabitur nomine ejus, Psalm. 72.17. See there.

Verse. 27. It shall be established for ever, as the Moon] If his sons be good,
they shall shine as the Sun in his strength (says Kimchi) as, if they be not,
yet they shall be as the Moon that shines, though for a time obscured or
eclipsed. A fit resemblance (says another Expositor) of the throne of Church
of Christ, Ainsw.
which has not always one face or appearance in the World, though it be
perpetual. The Papists would have this Moon always in the full; and if she
show put little light to us, they will not yield she is the Moon. And yet
(except in the Eclipse) Astronomers demonstrate that the Moon has at all times
as much light as she has in the full; but oftentimes a great part of the
bright side is turned to Heaven, and a lesser part to the earth. And so the
Church is ever conspicuous to Gods eye, though it appear not always so to us.

And as a faithful witness in Heaven] As often then as we see the Sun and Moon
in Heaven, let us think of the constancy of Gods Covenant, and the perpetuity
of Christ's Kingdom. By this faithful witness, some understand the Rainbow,
Genesis 9.13, etc.

Verse. 38. But thou have cast off, and abhorred] So it seemed to the Psalmist
through infirmity of the flesh (though his faith did ubique micare, appear ever
and anon amidst his complaints) and so the enemies reported and insulted.

Thou have been wroth with thine anointed] sc. Out of love displeased. And
here, as likewise in the verses following, omnia sunt Asyndeta, ad vehementiam

Verse. 39. Thou have made void the Covenant] This passage a certain Spanish
Rabbi stumbled at (as has been noted on the title of this Psalm) but without
cause; for all these things are spoken (...), and not (...), according to
opinion, and not according to the truth of things. And therefore Kimchi says
well here, Many wonder at this Psalmist, and I do as much wonder at their
wondering, etc.

Thou have profaned his Crown] By rendering his regal dignity contemptible.
(...).
The Greek renders it, his Sanctuary.

Verse. 40. Thou have broken down all his hedges] Or walls. The walls of Sparta
were their Militia, of England are their ships, of all lands their Laws,
Eccles. 10.8.

Thou have brought his strongholds to ruine] Or to consternation, and deadly
fright. Siqua manet gelida formidine concutis arcem. Buchanan.


Verse. 41. All that pass by the way spoil him] They rob and rifle him; such
havoc was made by Shishak, and is still by the Churches enemies, Heb. 10.34.

He is a reproach to his neighbours] Who now look upon him as a King of Clouts,
and ask, where is his invincible Majesty?

Verse. 42. Thou have set up] Thou seem to be on their side.

Thou have made all his enemies] To revell in his ruins.

Verse. 43. Thou have turned the edge] Disarmed and disabled him.

And have not made him, etc.] but turned his courage into cowardice.

Verse. 44. Thou have made his glory to cease] Heb. his brightness, the
splendent glory and dignity of the Kingdom: Some understand it of the
Priesthood, and the following words of the Kingdom.

Verse. 45. The days of his youth have thou shortened] Thou have nipped him in
the bud, snatched him away by an untimely end, as a young man is sometimes in
his prime and pride.

Thou have covered him with shame; Selah] Thou have wrapped him up in the
winding sheet of shame. Lord, this is true.

Verse. 46. How long, Lord, etc.] Here faith prevails against flesh, and
falls a praying, and at length a praising God.

Verse. 47. Remember how short] See Psalm. 39.5.

Wherefore have thou, etc.] As thou may seem to have done, unless they may
cheerfully serve thee, and enjoy thee.

Verse. 48. What man is he that lives, etc?] q. d. Since dye we must, let us
live while we may, to some good purpose.

Selah] q.d. Mark it, and meditate well and often on this savoury subject.

Verse. 49. Lord where are, etc.] q. d. Thou seem to have lost them, and we
would fain find them again for thee.

Verse. 50. Remember Lord] Thou seem to have forgotten us and our sufferings,
and we would fain remind thee.

Verse. 51. The fool steps of thine anointed] Heb. The heels or foot-soles,
that is, his doings and sufferings. The Chaldee and others render it,
tarditates, mor as Christi tui, the delays of thy Christ in coming, whom
therefore they twit us with, velut tar digradum vel loripedem and claudum, and
say, where is the promised Messiah?

Verse. 52. Blessed be the Lord, etc.] sc. For a Christ; or for adversity as
well as for prosperity; and this, not formally and slightly, but earnestly, and
with utmost affection, Amen, and amen.

PSALM. XC.
A Prayer of Moses] Made by him belike, when he saw the carcasses of the people
fall so fast in the wilderness; committed to writing for the instruction of
those that were left alive, but sentenced to death, Numb. 14. and here fitly
placed, as an illustration of that which was said in the precedent Psalm, Verse.
48. What man is he that lives, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his
soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

Verse. 1. Lord, thou have been our dwelling place] In all our troubles and
travels thorough this wilderness, and before, we have not been houselesse and
harbourlesse, Maon. habitaculum tutum.
for Thou have been our dewlling place, our habitacle of refuge, as some render
it. We use to say A man's house is his castle. The civile-law says, De domo sua
nemo extrahi debet, aut in jus vocari, quia domus tutissimum cuique resugium
atque receptaculum, No man ought to be drawn out of his house at the suit of
another; because his house is his safest refuge and receptacle. He that
dwells in God cannot be unhoused, because God is stronger than all; neither
can any one take another out of his hands, Joh. 10. Here then it is best for us
to take up as in our mansion house, and to seek a supply of all our wants in
God alone. It was a witty saying of that learned Picus Mirandula, God created
the Earth for beasts to inhabit, the Sea for fishes, the Air for fouls, the
Heaven for Angels and stars. Man therefore has not place to dwell and abide
in, but the Lord alone. See Ezekiel. 11.16.2 Cor. 6.8, 9, 10.

Verse. 2. Before the Mountains were brought forth] And they were made at the
creation, not cast up by the Flood, as some have held. Moses first celebrateth
Gods eternity, Eccles. 7.14.
and then sets forth man's mortality: that the one being set over against the
other (as Solomon speaks in another case) God may be glorified, and man
comforted, which is the main end of the holy Scriptures, Romans 15.4. and far
beyond those consolatiunculae ^ Philosophicae.

Verse. 3. Thou turnest man to destruction] Ad minutissimum quiddam, so Beza
renders it, to a very small business, to dust and powder. Others, ad
contritionem vel contusionem; by turning loose upon him diverse diseases and
distresses; thou turnest him out of the World, Eccles. 1.13. And generally,
thou layest of all and singular sons of men.

Return ye] Your bodies to the earth, according to the decree Genesis 3.17, 18,
19. your souls to God that gave them, Eccles. 12.7. And here the course of man's
life is compared (says One) to a race in a Tilt or Turney, where we soon run
to the end of the race as it were, and then return back again, Intelligit Moses
vit am humanam similem osse gyro, says Another. Man's life is compared to a
ring or round. we walk a short round; and then God gathers us in to himself.
One being asked what Life was? made an answer answerless, for he presently
turned his back and went his way. We fetch here but a turn, and God says,
Return ye Children of men. This some make to be an irony; as if God should
say, Live again, if ye can. Some apply it to the Resurrection, others to
Mortification, and Vivification.

Verse. 4. For a thousand years in thy sight, etc.] q. d. Live men a longer or
shorter space, Serius aut citius, thou endest their days; and in comparison of
thine Eternity, Punctum est quod vivimus and puncto minus, it is a small space
of time that the longest liver has upon earth, 2 Pet. 3.8. Psalm. 39.5. Non
multum sane abest a nihilo. Some would hence infer, that the Day of Judgment
shall last a thousand years; sides sit penes authors.

When it is passed] We judge better of the shortness of time, when it is past.

And as a watch in the night] Which is but three hours space; for Soldiers
divide the Night into four Watches, and our life is full of the darkness of
error and terror.

Verse. 5. Thou carryest them away as with a floud] Suddenly, violently,
irresistibly, by particular Judgments, besides that general necessity of dying
once, Heb. 9.27. This is set forth by a treble comparison, of Floods, Sleep,
and Flowers here; and indeed the vanity and misery of man's life is such, as
cannot sufficiently be set forth by an similitudes. See Verse. 9, 10.

They are like a sleep] Or dream; the dream of a shadow, says Pindarus; the
shadow of smoke, says another. (...).


They are as grass] An ordinary comparison, Isa. 40.6. Jam. 1.

Verse. 6. In the morning it flourisheth] So does man in his prime and vigor,
his bones full of marrow, his breasts of milk.

In the evening it is cut down] So is man by Deaths mortal Sithe, which moweth
down the Lillies of the Crown, as well as the Grass of the Field. In the
evening grass will cut better, and the Mowers can better work at it.

Verse. 7. For we are consumed by thine anger] Justly conceived for our sins,
ver. 8. this is a cause of death that Philosophy discovers not, as being
blind, and not able to see far off, and therefore cannot prescribe any
sufficient remedy against the fear of death, such as is here set down, verse.
12. but such as made Tully complain, that the Disease was too hard for the
Medicine, and such as left men either doubtful ( Socrates, for instance) or
desperate, and devoyd of sense, as Petronius in Tacitus, Qui in ipsis atriis
mortis delicias quaesivit, solaced himself with singing such light Sonnets as
this; Vovamus mea Lesbia atque omemus,
Rumoresque senum severiorum
Omnes unius aestimemus assis.


And by thy wrath are we troubled] Consternati sumus, Symmachus and Aquila
transtulerant acceleravimus.
Death stings us and sticks us; the motion and mention of it is terrible to us,
through sense of sin, and fear of wrath, Heb. 2.15.

Verse. 8. Thou have set our iniquities before thee] As a Judge does the
misdeeds of a Malefactor, together with the proofs and evidences.

Our secret sins] Which we either never took notice of or had utterly forgotten
( the sins of our youth, some render it, but not so well) those sins which we
had hoped to have secreted, such was our hypocrisy.

In the light of thy countenance] This light thou have made use of for the
discovery of our inmost evils, those that lie most up in the heart of the
Country, as it were, as the murmurings, and misbeleef of our hearts, etc. these
thy pure eyes, more clear and radiant than the Sun it self, have plainly
discerned. Nature teaches us, that the fiery eye needs no outward light, but
sees extramittendo, by sending out a ray, etc.

Verse. 9. For all our days are passed away] Heb. Do turn away the face. See
verse. 3.

We spend our years as a tale that is told] The grace whereof is brevity. q. d.
dicto citins.
Some render it, as a thought, that arises and passes. To this sense the
Greek Poet; (...).

The Chaldee has it, Ut flatus oris in Hyeme, as the breath of ones mouth in
Winter. See Jam. 4.14.

Verse. 10. The days of our years are threescore, etc.] So Solon in Laertius
says, the term of man's life is seventy years; this few exceed, and fewer
attain to. To the same sense speaks Macrobius also, Lib. 1. Some. cap. 6,
saying, Septies deni anni a Physicis creditur meta vivendi, and hoc vitae
humanae perfectum spacium terminatur, etc. The Fathers lived longer; but as
men's wickedness increased, so their days decreased; and now their lives are
daily shortened, the Generations dispatched away, that the World may the sooner
come to an end. If Moses and Aaron of old, and Johannes de temporibus, and some
few others of latter time live longer, even to an hundred or more, these are
singular examples, and it is of the generality that the Psalmist here speaks.

And if by reason of strength, D. Mayor
etc.] One reads it thus; And if by fortitude fourscore years, even their
latitude is labor and sorrow; that is, this enlarging of the time brings
nothing but labor and misery, because now the body is diseased, etc.

For it is soon cut off] As a Web, or as Grass.

And we flee away] As a Bird upon the wing, or as an hour of the day: Qui
nescit quo vita modo volat, audiat horas;
Quam sit vita fugax, nos docet iste sonus.


I am not eternity, said Epictetus, but a man; that is, a small part of the
whole, as the hour is of the day; Enchirid.
I must therefore come and go away as the hour does.

Verse. 11. Who knows the power of thine anger?] None does, since it is such as
no man can either avoid or abide; and such is men's stupidity, that few will
believe ti^l they feel it; no though their lives be so short, and uncertain.

Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath] Ira tua non est minor timore
nostro; let a man fear thee never so much, he is sure to feel thee much more,
if once he fall into thy fingers.

Verse. 12. So teach us to number our days] The Philosopher affirms, that man is
therefore the wisest of Creatures, B^u^a non numerant.
because he alone can number. But in this Divine Arithmetic of numbering our
days (to the which all other is not to be compared, no though we could, as
Archimedes boasted, number the Stars of Heaven, or the Sands by the Sea shore)
God himself must be our Teacher, or we shall never do it to purpose. R.
Solomon observes, that the word (...) rendered So, here, if taken as numeral
letters, makes Seventy, and they years of our life are seventy; out of which,
say other Rabbines, if we deduct the time of Childe-hood and Youth, which is
vanity, the time of sleep, repose, repast, and recreation (which is more than
the one half) and the time of affliction and grief which we enjoy not, what a
poor pittance will life be reduced unto?

That we may apply our hearts] Heb. That we may cause them to come; for
naturally they hang off and make strange.

Unto Wisdom] To the true fear of God, and mortification of sin, which is the
sling of death, and makes it a trap-door to hell. This is hard to do, but must
be done; or men are undone for ever. To live with dying thoughts, is the way
to dye with living comforts.

Verse. 13. Let it repent thee] Or, comfort thou thy servants.

Verse. 14. O satisfy us early] As thou did our Fathers with Manna.

Verse. 15. Make us glad according] Let us have a proportion at least.

Verse. 16. Let thy work appear] Thy proper work, which is to show mercy; for to
do Justice is thy work, thy strange work. Isa. 28.21.

And thy glory unto their children] That they at least may enter into the Land
of Canaan, according to Numb. 14.31.

Verse. 17. And let the beauty of the Lord, etc.] i.e. The bounty; the Italian
renders it, La Giocondita, jucunditas Domini sit innos.

And establish thou the work, etc.] Thus we had all need to pray; for, Nullius
est felix conatus et utilis unquam,
Consiliam si non detque juvetque Deus.


PSALM. XCI.
Verse. 1. He that dwells in the secret place, etc.] The safety of a Saint is
in this whole Psalm ( Quo nihil neque solidius neque splendidius dici potest)
set forth to the life, Verbis vivis, animatis sententiis and spiritus f^rvore
flagrantissimis.

Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty] Under the pleasant and assured
defense of God; he shall lodge under the shadow of Shaddai, and there sing away
care, and fear.

Verse. 2. I will say of the Lord] I dare say it is so as I have said, said the
Psalmist, (whom the Jews make to be Moses) and I will presently make proof of
it in my self; Non verbis solum praedicans, sed exemplis. Some conceive that
the Believer having heard the former Proposition, verse. 1. is here brought in
professing his faith; and saying to the Psalmist, Behold, I dwell in the secret
place of the most High, and shall I abide under the shadow of the Almighty? The
Answer follows.

Verse. 3. surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler] i. e. Of
the Devil, and his Emissaries, 2 Timothy 2.26. who by force and fraud seek to
ensnare the Saints. Gratiae privativae multo plures sunt quam positivae, says
Gerson. God daily delivers his from innumerable deaths and dangers. By Fowler
here, some understand the punishing Angel, 2 Samuel 24. and conceive that this
Psalm was penned upon occasion of that great Plague that followed upon David's
numbering the people; for then, if ever, both Prince and People stood in need of
special comfort, and here they have it. Divine consolations are therefore
sweet, because seasonable and suitable.

And from the noisome Pestilence] That uncomfortable and contagious disease. Ab
excidio exitiorum.
The vulgar renders it, and from rough words. In Hebrew Dabhar signifies a
word, Debher, a Pest; an evil tongue has the Pestilence in it.

Verse. 4. He shall cover thee with his feathers] As the Hen does her Chickens;
Fides est quae pullastrum, Christum gallinam facit, ut sub pennis ejus, speres;
number salus in pennis ejus, says Luther: It is Faith which makes thee the
little Chicken, and Christ the Hen; that thou may hide, and hope, hover, and
cover under his wings; for there is health in his wings.

And under his wings shall thou trust] For without Faith what use is there to
us of the Promises. Non de se debet sperare Christianus; si vule esse firmus
vapore materno nutriatur, ut pullus gallinaceus, says Austin; Let no man hope
for safety or strength, but under Christ's wings graciously stretched out over
him.

Verse. 5. Thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night] Thou shall be
freed, if not from the common destruction, yet from the common distraction.
Impavidum ferient ruinae.

Nor for the arrow that flies by day] Sudden ill occurrences quae nec
provident nec praecavent fideles, the arrows of Death shall come whisking by
thine ears, and not hit. Quid quisque Hor. lib. ^. Od. 13.
vitet nunquam hominisatis
Cautum est in horas -- Improvisa lethi
Vis rapuit, rapietque gentes.


True Faith is a Target, and saves a man, if not from the smart, yet from the
hurt of evil accidents.

Verse. 6. Nor for the Pestilence] Called before Terror, and Arrow, as some
conceive. Hippocrates calls it (...), the Divine Disease, because sent more
immediately from God, as an evil Messenger. Not but that a good man may dye of
the Plagues, as did Oecolampadius, and many others; Hezechiah is thought to
have had it, so had reverend Beza (his Family was four several times visited
here with) who was much comforted under that and other heavy afflictions by
this sweet Psalm, which therefore he hugged and held most dear all the days of
his life, as himself witnesses in his argument, and use of this Psalm.

Nor for the destruction that wastes at noon-day] For the noon-day-Devil (so
the Vulgar renders it after the Sept.) as, for Pestilence walking in darkness,
one old English Manuscript has Goblin. The Chaldee here expounds it, the
company of Devils. As, in the next verse, A thousand shall fall at thy side,
and ten thousand, etc. R. Solomon expounds, A thousand Devils shall pitch
their tents on thy right hand, and on thy left; but shall not hurt thee,
because the good Angels shall counterguard thee against them. But it is better
to understand all (as before) of the Pestilence, though I doubt not but the
Devil that old manslayer has a hand in this, and other common calamities; yet
not without the Lords overruling power limiting him.

Verse. 7. A thousand shall fall, etc.] This deadly disease lays heaps upon
heaps, (as we have had lamentable experience) and scarce leaves living enough to
bury the dead, as in the days of Decius the Emperor.

But it shall not come nigh thee] Thou shall be antidoted, and privileged; sc.
if God see it good for thee. See verse. 6. and thou be careful to serve his
providence. The Turks shun not the company of those that have the plague; but
pointing upon their foreheads, say, It was written there at their birth when
they shall dye. Thus to do, is not to trust god, but to tempt him.

Verse. 8. Only with thine eyes shall thou behold] And say, O the severity of
divine justice! O the venomous and mischievous nature and effects of men's sin!
Behold the goodness and severity of God; on them which sell severity, but
toward me goodness, if I continue in his goodness; otherwise I shall also be
cut off, Romans 11.22.

And see the reward of the wicked] Thy self being as it were shot-free; thy
sincerity prevailing for thy safety.

Verse. 9. Because thou have made the Lord which is my refuge, etc.] Because
thou have done, as I do, thou shall speed as I have sped; for God is rich in
mercy to all his.

Even the Most High thy habitation] See Psalm. 90.1.

Verse. 10. There shall no evil befall thee] No devoratory evil, as Tertullian
expresses it; nothing that tends ad exitium, but only ad exercitium, and
such as shall end in thy good.

Neither shall any plague] What a wonderful separation made the Lord betwixt
the houses of the Israelites and the Egyptians, Exodus 11.7? See Job 5. and take
these places, as verse 6. For it may befall a Saint to share in a common
calamity; as the good Corn and weeds are cut down together, but for a different
end and purpose, -- Non te tua plurima, Pentheu,
Labentem texit piet as --


Verse. 11. For he shall give his Angels charge over thee] This guard of Angels,
many Angels, yea all, if need be, to secure every poor believer, how manly
soever he thinks of himself, or is esteemed by others, is no small privilege.
See Mat. 4 6. with the Note.

To keep thee en all thy wayes] In all thy lawful and Christian undertakings;
for no further does God or his holy Angels take charge of thee. If we keep not
within Gods precincts, we cannot look for his protection. Wefts and strayes
fall to the Lord of the soil. The State secureth none that are abroad at undue
hours, that travel not betwixt Sun and Sun. Divines observe, that the Devil,
citing this Text, Mat. 4.6. left out these words on purpose, as not for his
purpose; yet does not our Savior so much as upbraid him with this mutilation,
nor yet tell him of that which follows, verse 13. Thou shall tread upon the
Lion and Adder, etc. to teach us, in dealing with an adversary, not to lie at
the catch, but answer to the thing, etc.

Verse. 12. They shall bear thee up in their hands] See the Note on Mat. 4.6.
and be sensible of the many good offices done us by the blessed Angels, not
once looking for our thanks.

Verse. 13. Thou shall tread upon the Lion, etc.] No Creature shall harm thee,
so as to hinder thineeternal happiness. See Isa. 11.6, 7, 8. Hos. 2.18. Job
5.23. Mar. 16.18. this Text was shamefully abused by Pope Alexander, Anno 1159.
when at Venice he trod upon the neck of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa; and
said, as here, super leonem and aspidem ambulabis, etc.

Verse. 14. Ardet me, am plexus est me.
Because he has set his love upon me, etc.] Because he cleaves unto me, and
acquiesceth in me. Thus God is brought in speaking toward the close of all,
for greater assurance. Aben-Ezra says, it is the speech of God to his Angels.

I will set him on high, because he has known my name] And hence it is, that
his heart is so set upon me. They that know Gods name will surely trust in
him, Psalm. 9.10. Thy name is as an ointment poured out, therefore do the
Virgins love thee, Cant. 1.3. But unkent unkist, as the Northern Proverb has
it; men therefore care not for God, because they know not his excellencies.

Verse. 15. He shall call upon mee] This is an indispensable duty; and will be
cheerfully performed by those that know and love the Lord.

I will deliver him, etc.] As he did David, Joseph, Daniel, and others.

Verse. 16. with long life, etc. he shall have enough of this life present even
to a satiety; and Heaven in the end. The Hebrews call this Psalm Canticum de
accidentibus. When Beza came first to the reformed Church, he found them
singing this Psalm, and was greatly encouraged.

PSALM. XCII.
A Psalm or song for the Sabbath day] The Sabbath in the Hebrew has its name
from resting; and is near allied to two other words, (...)
the first whereof signifies to sit still, and second to worship and give
praise. On this day they met for works of Piety (as sacrificing, reading and
expounding the Scriptures, praying, singing, as here, etc.) and of mercy,
Matthew. 12.2-7, 8, 11, 12. And this Psalm treating of Gods great Works, was
purposely set for a Canon of sanctifying that day called by the Jews the Queen
of days; in praise whereof, before and after meat, they daily say certain
verses.

Verse. 1. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord] And the Sabbath Day
is a good time to do it in; for then (as Kimchi here notes) men are at leisure
and liberty to do it most solemnly; the better day, the better deed.

And to si^g praises unto thy name] The Psalmist common ends it, and presently
sets upon the doing of it. So Psalm. 122.6, 7. he no sooner bids pray for the
Peace of Jerusalem, but himself prays, Peace be within thy walls, etc.

Verse. 2 To show forth thy loving kindness in the morning] Every morning, that
God may have the first fruits of the day, but especially on the
Sabbath-morning, when we awake and rise, ad quietem and ad delicias animi and
corporis, as Kimchi here has it. The Jews bless God at the Sabbaths coming
in, and going out.

And thy faithfulness in the night] Breaking our sleep for that purpose; yea
we must be in the fear of the Lord all the day long, Prove. 23.17. how much more
on the Sabbath Day? then our whole work must be to be ravished in spirit, doing
no work, but such as whereby we either bless God, or look to receive a
blessing from God; none but such as wherein we would the Lord should find us at
his coming; which Lactantius says will be on the Sabbath Day.

Verse. 3. Upon an instrument of ten strings, etc.] This was part of the Jewish
pedagogy; and teaches us to use all lawful means to enforce our selves to
that, whereunto we are so dull and backward.

Verse. 4. For thou Lord have made me glad, etc. And I will improve this
cheerfulness to thankfulness, Jam. 5.13. On the Sabbath we ought solummodo
spiritualibus gaudiis repleri, to be filled with spiritual joys only, says
the Council of Paris held Anno 820.

I will triumph in the works of thy hands] sc. The works of Creation,
Administration, but especially of Redemption.

Verse. 5. O Lord, how great are thy works?] Surely so great, that I cannot
utter then, and must therefore thus vent my self by an exclamation. Expleri
mentem nequeo, ardescoque tuend^. Virgil.


And thy thoughts are very deep] Here then we must do as those Romans did, who
when they found a Lake, the depth whereof was unknown, they dedicated it to
Victory. Cry, O the depth, and there rest us.

Verse. 6. A brutish man knows not] A sottish sensualist who has his soul for
salt only, to keep his body from putrefying, (as we say of swine) he takes no
knowledge of Gods great works, but grunts and goes his ways; contenting
himself with a natural use of the Creatures, as beasts do.

Verse. 7. When the wicked spring as the grass, etc.] This the fool admireth,
calling the proud happy, etc. Mal. 3.15. and not considering that that proud
grass shall be mown down, and that flourish shall soon perish.

It is that they shall be destroyed for ever] Not grow again, as mown grass
does: Exoriuntur ut exurantur. It is but as Hamans banquet before execution.

Verse. 8. But thou Lord art most high, etc.] q.d. Flourish the wicked never so
much, shoot they up never so high, thou art higher, and in the thing wherein
they deal proudly, thou art above them, Exodus 18.11.

Verse. 9. For lo thine enemies, etc.] The Psalmist by this demonstrative
particle Lo, points to it as it were with the Finger, as a thing most evident
and undoubted.

Shall be scattered] Disparant se, dissiliunt, dispart themselves.

Verse. 10. Like the horn of an Unicorn] Which is very fair, hard, and well
lifted up. See Numb. 23.26. I am in good plight.

I shall be anointed] It Is well for the present, and it will be better hereafter.

Verse. 11. Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies] Or, on mine
observers, who watch for my halting.

Verse. 12. The Righteous shall flourish like the Palm] A tree that grows not
in these cold climats, but where it does, is noted for tall, constantly green,
longlived, (...). Theoph.
sweet, firm, straight, etc. Nititur in pondus palma and cousurgit in altum;
Quo magis and premitur, hoc mage toll it onus. Alciat, Emblem.



Though it has many waights at the top, and many snakes at the bottom, yet it
still faith, Nec premor, nec perimor.

Like a Cedar] Not like grass, as the wicked do. Verse 7.

Verse. 13. Those that be planted] Having taken deep root there; Hypocrites are
only thrust in, as a stake, into the earth. Mnason was an old Disciple,
Andronicus and Junia were in Christ before Paul, ^om. 16.7.
and therefore of note among the Apostles for well rooted and fruited.

In the Courts of our God] In Christ, and under the ordinances.

Verse. 14. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age] Quantumvis veteres,
non veterascent, though old, yet they shall retain their former vigor and
verdure; and be like that Persian tree in Theophrastus, that at the same time
does bud, blossom, and bear fruit, pullulantes and succulentae.

They shall be fat and flourishing] Vividi and vegeti, Bucholc.
not as the Brabanti or Flemmings, qui quo magis senescunt, eo magis
stultescunt, says Erasmus, the elder, the foolisher; nor as Trapezuntius, who
outlived all his learning; but as Moses, whose sight failed not, his heat
abated not; as Wine, the older the better; as the Sun which shines most
amiably toward the descent.

Verse. 15. To show that, etc.] This is one of their principal fruits, to give
God 2 testimonial, such as good old Moses does, Deuteronomy. 32.4.

PSALM. XCIII.
Verse. 1. The Lord reigneth] i.e. The Lord Christ. Kimchi here notes that all
the following Psalms till the hundred and first are de diebus Christi, of the
days of Christ. Here we have his empire and regality asserted, first, by his
works, secondly, by his word, verse. 5. See the like, Psalm. 19.1, 2. -- 7, 8.
etc. and that manifestation of himself by his word far preferred.

He is clothed with Majesty] He has now put off his arms, and put on his
robes, he will henceforth rule all wisely and righteously.

The Lord is clothed with strength] For the battle; in case his enemies stir,
to attempt against him, Ezra. 8.22.

The World also is established] The earth, though it hang like a ball in the
air, without a basis, Ponderibus librata suis, yet is unmovable; how much more
the Church?

Verse. 2. Thy throne in established of old] Christ shall reign, utcunque
fremant scelerati, and omnia quantum in se est conturbent, rage the wicked
never so; for he is Jehovah, verse. 1. the eternal, here; -- Firma aeternus qui
considet arce.

Verse. 3. Hypotyposis.
The floods have lifted up, O Lord] Armies of enemies have attempted great
matters, but thou have soon queld and quasht them. Immota manet, may well be
the Churches motto. Auratonet, sonet unda maris, fremat orbis and orcus;
Tutamen insertos nos tibi, Christ, tegis.


The floods lift up their waves] The Word for waves has its name from dashing
or breaking; Anaphora.
the enemies do but beat themselves into foam and froth against Christ the
Rock, qui instar rupis quae in mar^ vadoso, horridi Jovis, and irat^, ut ita
dicam, Neptuni fervidis assultibus undique verberata, non cedit aut minuitur,
sed obtendit assuetum fluctibus la^us; and firma duritie tumentis undae impetum
sustinet ac frangit. Woverius.


Verse. 4. The Lord on high is mightier] He overtops Tyrants and persecutors, be
they never so terrible for noise and number. ^^ he but thunder they are hushed,
and glad to wriggle, as worms, into their holes.

Verse. 5. Thy Testimonies are very sure] Thy promises infallible; and therefore
rage the World never so, thou shall still have an holy Catholic Church, such
as whose principles, practices, and aims are divine and supernatural; such as
walk worthy of God in all well-pleasing, and inasmuch as they have these rich
promises, do cleanse themselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,
perfecting holiness in the fear of God, 2 Cor. 7.1.

Holiness becomes thine house] God looks to be served like himself; he will
be sanctified of all those that draw near unto him in holy duties, Levit. 10.3.
This the Heathens were not altogether ignorant of, and therefore at their
sacrifices the Priests cried out (...), who is here? Erasint Praef, in Adag.
whereunto the people that were present answered, (...), here are many, and
those good men all. -- Procul hinc procul este profani.

PSALM. XCIV.
Verse. 1. O Lord God to whom vengeance belongeth] Heb. Jehovah God of revenges;
so Jer. 51.56. The Lord God of recompenses. Vengeance is mine says He, I will
repay, Deuteronomy. 32.35. And it is best he should; for he returns a just
recompense of reward, Heb. 2.2. whereas men seek often an unequal revenge, as a
stab for the lie given; and besides, in seeking the lives of others, Heb. 10.30.
they sometimes lose their own.

Show thy self] Heb. Shine forth, appear for thy poor wronged servant. David
knew the Law, and submitted to it; he turns over his enemies to God to be
ordered by him; neither did he himself herein any dis-service. I seek not mine
own glory (so mine own revenge) says Christ; but there is one that seeks it.
God never fails to do it, to be their Champion, who strive not for
themselves, only they must wait his leisure, and not preoccupate his executions.

Verse. 2. Lift up thy self thou Judge of the earth] Judges as they ascend the
Tribunal, so when to pass sentence they usually stand up. See Isa. 33.10.
And hereunto the Psalmist alludeth.

Verse. 3. Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long?] Bis, quia de die in diem
gloriantur, says Aben-Ezra. Twice he says it, because the wicked boast day
after day, with such insolency and outrage, as if they were above control.

Verse. 4. Hour long shall they utter] Heb. They will bluster (or will-out as a
fountain) they will speak hard things (speak milstones, throw daggers) they
will boast themselves (talk largely of their good parts and practices) all this
is expressed by an elegant Asyndeton, to show that they did all this
ordinarily, and uncessantly. (...). Euripid.


Verse. 5. They break in pieces thy people] They make potsheards of them. And
this is the best use they make of thy patience; break it off therefore.

Verse. 6. They slay the widow and the stranger] Those sacred persons, thy
proper clients; to such an height of hard-heartednesse are they grown, that
they pity not them whom nature and curtesy would show compassion to. Nulla
fides, pietasque viris qui castra sequ^ntur.

Let us bless our selves out of the bloody fingers of barbarous and brutish
men, skilful to destroy.

Verse. 7. Yet they say, The Lord shall not see] To all other their enormities
they added this, Lib. 2. c. 7.
that they denied a divine providence, and professed profaneness. Irridendum
vero, curam agere reruns humanarum illud quicquid est summum, says Pliny,
delivering the sense of all other Atheists.

Verse. 8. Under stand O ye bru^ish] Ye that are ringleaders to the rest, but no
wiser than the reasonlesse creatures; yea, therefore worse, because ye ought to
be better. Polybius complains of man's folly above that of other Creatures, in
these words, Caetera animantes ubi semel offenderint, cavent; non vulpes aa
laqueum, lupus ad foveam, canis ad fustem temere redibunt; Solus home ab aevo
ad aevum peccat fere iniisdem.

Verse. 9. He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?] Shall the Author of
these senses be senseless? Our God is not as that Jupiter of Creet, who was
pictured without ears, and could not be at leisure to attend upon small
matters. He is (...); he is also (...), all eye, all ear. We read of a people
called Panotii, God only is so, to speak properly.

He that formed the eye, shall he not see?] He says forms, because there are
many forms or species in the eye continually; and as the optic virtue in thy
eye sees all, and is seen of none, so does God much more. All David's ways
were in Gods sight, all Gods laws in David's sight, Psalm. 119.168.

Verse. 10. He that chastises the Heathen, shall not he correct?]. Qui totis
gentibus non parcit, vos non redarguet? He that punishes profane Nations that
know him not, shall he spare you, Amos 3.2? Shall not tribulation and anguish
be upon the Jew first. Romans 2.9? The Chaldee thus paraphraseth, He that gave a
law to his people, shall he not punish them when they transgress it?

He that teaches man knowledge] Shall not be know? is to be supplied to make
sense. The Psalmist seems so displeased at men's doubting or denying of this,
that he could not perfect his sentence, through passion of mind. Some causes
indeed do give that which themselves have not; as the lifelesse heaven
inliveneth; the dull whetstone sharpeneth. But here it is far otherwise, and
woe be to such as act not accordingly, Isa. 29.15.

Verse. 11. The Lord knows the thoughts of man that they are vanity] Or worse;
that they are ever weaving spiders webs, or else hatching Cockatrice eggs, Isa.
59.5. This sentence St. Paul allegeth against the Worlds wizzards, 1 Cor. 3.20.
who the wiser they were, the vainer they were, Romans 1.21. As Austin writing to
a man of great paris, says, Ornari abste Diabolus quarit, the Devil would
fain be tricked up by thee.

Verse. 12. Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, etc.] And thereby
effectest, that his vain thoughts lodge not within him, Jer. 4.14. but that the
wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and return to
thee, etc. Isa. 55.7. Feri Domine, feri, said Luther, strike whiles thou
please, Lord; only to thy correction add instruction, Vt quod noceat,
doceat. See my Lovetokens.

And teach him out of thy law] Lashing him, but withal lessoning him, ut
resipiscat, and serviat tibi cord perfecto, says Kimchi here, that he may
repent and serve thee with an upright heart; for which purpose affliction
sanctified is of singular use. Crux voluntat is Dei schola, morum disciplina,
felicitatis meditatorium, gau dii Spiritus sancti officina, breviter bonorum
omnium thesaurus, says Brentius on Job 33.16.

Verse. 13. That thou may give him rest] Here usually, but hereafter
certainly. Mors arumnarum requies, was Chaucers Motto; those that dye in the
Lord shall rest from their labors. Meanwhile they are chastened of the Lord,
that they may not be condemned with the World, 1 Cor. 11.32.

Until the pit be dug for the wicked] Until the cold grave hold his body,
and hot Hell hold his soul.

Verse. 14. For the Lord will not cast off his people] Though he cast them into
the furnace of affliction. The wicked he brings into misery, and there
leaves them, to come off as they can, Ezekiel. 22.20. and 29.5. Not so the
Saints, Zach. 13.9. Isa. 43.2. Heb. 13.5.

Nor for sake his inheritance] Because His. Senecai
Patriam quivis ama, (...) quia pulchram, sed quia suam. All love their own.

Verse. 15. But judgment shall return unto Righteousness] All shall be set to
rights, and every one have his due, according to Romans 2.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. if not
sooner, yet at the day of judgment without fail. Some give this sense,
severity shall be changed into mercy, the rigor of the law to the clemency of
the Gospel. Others thus, judgment shall return to Righteousness, that is, to
its own place; licet defertur judicium non aufertur.

And all the upright in heart shall follow it] viz. In their affections; they
are carried out after it, earnestly desiring that dear day when God will
unriddle his providence, and clear up his proceedings with the sons of men.
Some read, shall follow him, that is, God; being brought home to him by their
afflictions, they shall follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes. Not so every
loose ungirt Christian or profligate professor.

Verse. 16. Who will rise up for me?] q.d. But a very few fast friends find I
at Court, Jonathan excepted. Some there are that will sprinkle me with
Court-holywater (as they say) give glozing speeches; but it is little that they
will do, and yet less that they will suffer for me. Faithful friends, says
One, are gone on pilgrimage, and their return is uncertain.

Verse. 17. Except the Lord had been my help] He loves to help at a pinch; he
usually reserveth his hand for a dead lift. See 2 Timothy 4.16, 17.

My soul had almost dwelt in silence] i.e. In the dark cloisters of death. The
Greek and Latin Translators render it, In Hell.

Verse. 18. when I said my foot slippeth] I stand on a precipice, and shall be
down. Hypotyposis est.

Thy mercy O Lord held mee] I have subsisted merely by a miracle of thy mercy,
by a prop of thine extraordinary pity and patience.

Verse. 19. In the multitude of my thoughts within mee] My perplexed,
intricated, insnarled, intertwined (as the branches of a tree) cogitations and
ploddings upon my daily sufferings; when I know not what to think, or which way
to take to.

Thy comforts delight my soul] The Believer is never without his cordial; he
has comforts that the World wots not of. The good Lantgrave of Hessen being
held prisoner for a long time together by Charles the fifth Emperor, said, that
he could never have held it out so, but that he felt the divine consolations of
the Martyrs. August.
Martyr etiam in catena gaudet, etc. says Austin; Crux inunct a est, says
Bernard. Godliness has many crosses, and as many comforts; like as Egypt has
many venomous Creatures, but withal many Antidotes against them.

Verse. 20. Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee?] Shall
Tyrants and Oppressors (who do exercise regiment without righteousness)
entitle thee to their wicked proceedings, and go unpunished? See Isa. 36.10.
with 37.36. the Throne or Tribunal is called, The holy place, Eccles. 8.10. woe
then to those that pollute it.

Which frames mischief by a Law] As did the Primitive Persecutors, with their
bloody Edicts against Christians; and the Popish Bishops, or whose Laws that of
Politian was verified, Inventum Actiae dicuntur jura Draconis:
Verse est fama nimis, nil nisivir us habent.


Some render it, Praeter, vel contra legem, beside or against Law.

Verse. 21. They gather together] Heb. Run by troops, as Thieves do.

Against the soul] Which they would gladly destroy, if it lay in their power.
This the Popish persecutors often attempted, but God has better provided, Mat.
10.28.

Verse. 22. But the Lord is my defence] Heb. My high place, where I am set out
of their reach.

Verse. 23. And he shall bring upon them, etc.] See Psalm. 7.15, 16.

PSALM. XCV.
Verse. 1. O come, let us sing unto the Lord] It is thought by this beginning,
that this Psalm was not penned by David for private use, but for public
Assemblies, to be sung by the Congregation on the Sabbath, and such like times,
It may very well be that they began their morning Sacrifice with this Psalm, as
the Latin Church also afterward did their Mattens, or Morning Service.

Let us make a joyful noyse] With a clear and loud voice, as of a Trumpet;
singing with grace in our hearts unto the Lord.

Verse. 2. Let us come before his presence] Heb. Prevent his face, be there with
the first. Let us go speedily -- I will go also, Zech. 8.21. Let praise wait
for God in Sion, Psalm. 65.1. Rabbi Gaon, Praveniamus and ante diem judicii, Let
us make haste, says he, to do it before the Day of Judgment; and lest we be
taken with our task undone. Others, let us anticipate his face, that is,
prepare our hearts at home, before we come into the public; or, let us give
thanks for mercies already received, that we may make way for more.

With Psalmes] Oratione prorsa and vorsa.

Verse. 3. For the Lord is a great God] Understand it of Christ, as the Apostle
also does, Heb. 3. and 4. 1 Cor. 10.

Above all Gods] Whether reputed so, or deputed, as Kings.

Verse. 4. In his hand are the deep places] Heb Searching, that is, much
searched aster, but sound to be unsearchable. A (...) vo'ucris volan, in altum.
R. Solom.


The strength of the hills] Heb. The heights, such as will sport a bird to get
to the top of them. Depths and heights are his.

Verse. 5. The Sea is his, etc.] Canutus confuted his Flatterers (who told him
that all things in his Dominions were at his beck and check) by laying his
command on the Sea, Hen. Hunting^on.
to come up no higher into his Land, but it obeyed him not.

And his hands formed the dry land] Worship him therefore, Rev. 4.

Verse. 6. O come, let us worship, and fall down] With our whole bodies
prostrate on the ground, Kimchi.
our hands and feet stretched out. The Jews gesture of adoration at this day is
the bowing forward of their bodies, for kneeling they use none (no more do the
Graecians) neither stir they their Bonnets in their Synagogues to any man,
Spec. Eur.
but remain still covered.

The Lord our Maeker] Who has not only created us, but advanced us, as he did
Moses and Aaron, 1 Samuel 12.6.

Verse. 7. The people of his pasture] Whom he turns not out into Commons and
Fallows, but feeds among Lillies, Cant. 2.16.

And the sheep of his hand] His Cades brought up at hand, eating of his meat,
and drinking of his cup, and lying in his bosom, as Uriahs Ewe-Lamb did, 2 Samuel 12.3.

To day if ye will hear his voyce] i.e. Whiles the day of grace lasts, which
is not long, 2 Cor. 6.2. Qui paenitenti veniam spofpondit, peccanti crastinum
non promisit, says Gregory.

Verse. 8. Harden not your hearts] by unbeleef, and the deceitfulness of sin,
Heb. 3.12, 13. which gradually obfirmeth the heart against God.

As in the provocation As your fathers did at Massah and Meribah: be not you as
good at resisting the Holy Ghost us they were, Act. 7.51.

Verse. 9. When your Fathers tempted mee] The times, all along the wilderness,
Number. 14.2^
though

They saw my works] Both mercies and judgments, Psalm. 98.8. yet they were
refractory and unmalleable.

Verse. 10. Was I grieved] Litigavi, vel cum taedio pertuli.

That do err in their hearts] Wandering, though not so wide, as to miss of
Hell.

They have not known] viz. practically and savingly.

Verse. 11. Unto whom I sware] When put past all patience. Patientia lasa fit
furor.

If they enter, etc.] This God swears cum reticentia, to show how greatly he
was incensed.

PSALM. XCVI.
Verse. 1. O sing unto the Lord a new song] For this new mercy of the Ark now
brought into Jerusalem from the house of Obed-Edom, I Chron. 16.23. but
especially of Christ (typified by the Ark) who should be preached unto the
Gentiles, believed on in the World, received up to glory. I Tim. 3.16^


Sing unto the Lord all the earth] Which they could not do aright, till they
had heard, believed, and were sealed, Ephesians. 1.13. Unbeleevers can have no true
notion of God, but as of an enemy; and therefore all their verbal praises are
but a black sanct is, suitable to such Saints.

Verse. 2. Sing unto the Lord, etc.] David was at this time full of affection,
and exultation of Sprit (insomuch as Michal mocked him for it, 1 Chronicles. 15.29.)
and thence this heap of holy expressions to the same purpose. Out of the
abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.

Show forth his salvation] Evangelize, Preach the Gospel of salvation by
Christ; see Psalm. 40.10. 2 Samuel 18.18. Isa. 61.1. where the same word is used.

Form day to day] Other news delights us only at first hearing; but the good
news of our redemption is sweet from day to day, ac si in eodem die redemptio
fuisset operata, says Kimchi here, as if it were done but to day. Tam recens
mihi nunc Christus est, says Luther, ac si hac hora fudisset sanguinem, Christ
is now as fresh unto me as if he had shed his blood but this very hour.

Verse. 3. Declare his glory] Hob. S^pher it up in the particulars; that God be
no loser by you.

His wonders among all people] There is a world of wonders in the work of man's
redemption by Christ; and all other mercies meet in this, as the lines in the
center, streams in the fountain.

Verse. 4. For the Lord is great] Vere magnus est Christianorum Deus, said
Calocerius an Heathen; he is omni laud major, and merito mituendus, says
David here, and elsewhere often. Sound out therefore and send abroad his worthy
praises, the others may hear and fear.

Verse. 5. For all the Gods, etc.] Deunculi, deastri, Those petty Gods, those
dunghill-deities of the Heathens, are nullities; indeed they are Devils, and
those Idols were their receptacles, and as it were their bodies, from whence
in some places they gave oracles; but were silenced at Christ's coming in the
flesh, to the great amazement of their superstitious worshipers.

But the Lord made the Heavens] With singular artifice, Heb. 11.10. Clem. Ale^
Paid. l. 1. c. ^^
using (...) every engine of wisdom.

Verse. 6. Honor and Majesty are before him] These are his Harbingers, and they
go often coupled, as Psalm. 21.45.111.145. Job 40. etc. By the former seems to
be meant outward port and splendor; by the latter, inward reverence and
respect following thereupon.

Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary] Gods glory shines more in his
Church, than in all the World besides.

Verse. 7. Give unto the Lord] See Psalm. 29.1, 2. One renders it Tribuite
ponderose, unde (...) onus, pondus portate: to show, that our praises of God
should be ponderous and substantial.

Verse. 8. Give unto the lord the glory, etc.] It was hard for the Heathens to
forgo their superstitions ( Tully resolved he would never do it, etc.)
therefore they are here so pressed to it. See ^ev. 14.6, 7. With the Notes
there. One Expositor geiveth this note here, Ternarius numerus est sacer ^b
mysterium Triadis; ideo enim co scriptura gaudet. The Scripture often presses or
expresieth things thrice over, in reference to the mystery of the holy Trinity.

Bring an offering] Reasonable service, Geneb.
Romans 12.1. spiritual sacrifices acceptable by Jesus Christ, 1 Pet. 2.5.

Verse. 9. O worship the Lord, etc.] Supplicate proni, fall flat on your faces.
See Psalm. 95.6.

In the beauty of holinesse] i.e. In his courts, as verse 8. or in holy beauty,
as some render it; that is, in true faith, and with good affections.

Fear before him] Rejoice before him with trembling, Psalm. 2.

Verse. 10. Say among the Heathen] Proclamate undique praecones, etc. Make
proclamation every where, that now the Lord Christ reigns; and that there
shall be a general Jubilee.

The World also shall be established] There is no true stability, but where
Christ reigns; he will settle peace and good order, which the Devil, that
turbulent spirit, and his agents, desire to disturb, and to set all on an
hurry-comb.

Verse. 11. Let the Heavens rejoice, etc.] Let there be a general joy for the
general renovation by the coming of Christ, Romans 8.22. after which the whole
creation groaneth also. Basil and others by Heaven, Earth, etc. understand
Angels, men of all sorts, an Islanders, seamen, fieldmen, woodlanders, etc. Vel
est simil^tudo ad denotandam in mundo pacem, says Kimchi, Or it is a
similitude to note peace all over the World. And surely when Christ came there
was an universal aut pax aut paectio (says Florus) peace or truce under the
government of Augustus.

Let the Sea roar] Heb. Thunder; Externo fragore and bombo testetur internam
animi laetitiam; let it testify its joy, perstrependo and reboando by roaring
its utmost.

Verse. 12. Let the field be joyful, etc.] And so give check to the hardness
of man's heart, not at all affected with those benefit by Christ, wherein they
are far more concerned than these insensible creatures; which yet have lain
bed-ridden as it were, ever since man's fall, and earnestly wait for the
manifestation of the Sons of God, Romans 8.19.

Verse. 13. Before the Lord, for he comes, for he commeth] Certainly,
suddenly, happily, etc. for this is the sum of all the good news in the
World, that Christ comes and comes; that is says Basil, once to show the
World how they shall be saved; and a second time to judge the World, for
neglecting so great salvation, etc.

PSALM. XCVII.
Verse. 1. The Lord reigneth] This is matter of greatest joy to the Righteous.
Gandeo quod Christus Dominus est, al^oqui totus desperassem, I am glad that
Christ is Lord of all; for otherwise I should utterly have been out of hope,
says Micon^us in an Epistle to Calvin, upon the view of the Churches enemies.

Let the multitude of Isles be glad] As more happy herein than any of those
called the Fortunate Islands, Turk. Hist.
or than Cyprus anciently called Macaria, that is, The blessed Isle, for her
abundance of commodities.

Verse. 2. Clouds and darkness are round about him] As once at the delivering
of the Law; so now in the publishing Gospel, he is no less terrible, having
vengeance in store for the disobedient, 2 Cor. 10.6. It is a savor of death to
unbeleevers. Christ came to send fire on the earth, Luke 12.49.

Righteousness and judgment, etc.] Mercy Christ has for the penitent:
judgment for the rebellious, who seek to dethrone him. Woe to those
Gospel-sinners.

Verse. 3. A fire goes before him] For even our God is a consuming fire, Heb.
12.29. (and not the God of the Jews only) as shall well appear at the last day,
2 These. 1.8. See the Note on verse 2.

Verse. 4. His Lightenings enlightened the World] His Apostles, those fulmina
Ecclesinstica, shall spread Gospel Light and amaze people; the Lord working
with them, and confirming their word with signs following, Mar. 16.20.

Verse. 5. The hills melted like wax] Nothing shall be so stout and steady as to
be able to stand before them.

Before the Lord] Adon, Dominator, The Maker and Master of all, the rightful
Proprietary and Paramount. The Latin translation has it, All the earth is
before the face of the Lord.

Verse. 6. The Heavens declare his Righteousnesse] As so many Catholic
Preachers, Psalm. 19.1. and 50.4.6. By Heavens some understand Angels,
concurring with men to glorify God. Others, the heavenly bodies pleading Gods
cause against Atheists and Idolaters. They that worshipped the Sun were
Atheists by night; and they that worshipped the Moon were Atheists by day, as
Cyrill wittily.

Verse. 7. Confounded be all they that serve graven images] Those Instruments of
Idolatry, and lurking-places of Devils, diabolicae inspirationis and instine^us
participes. Such and their Servants we may lawfully pray against.

That boast themselves of Idols] As did that Idolatrous Micah, Judge. 17.
Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 3. Julian called therefore Idolian, the Papists at this
day. See D. Rainolds de Idololatria Romana.

Worship him all ye Gods] i. e. All ye Angels, says the Greek and Arabic; and
the Apostle says the same, Hob. 1.6. proving Christ to be God-man. This Psalm
says Beza is highly to be prized of all Christ's, as containing a most divine
Epitome of all Gospel-mysteries.

Verse. 8. Sion heard and was glad] Heard what? the downfull of the Devils
Kingdom, and the erecting of Christ's scepter; this was good news to the Church,
and her Children. Bern was the first Town that after the Reformation burnt
their images. Zurich followed on an Ashwensday, which they observe and
celebrate every year to this day, with all mirth, plays and pastimes, Act. and
Mon.
as an Ashwednesday of Gods own making.

Verse. 9. For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth] Declared now to be so
with power, as Romans 1.4. and the World convinced of singularr sottishness in
fancying other divinities.

Thou art exalted far above all gods] Far above all principality, and power,
and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this World,
but also in that which is to come, Ephesians. 1.21. Here then we have the
superexaltation of Christ's person; and the Apostle manifestly alludeth to it,
Ephesians 4.10. Phil. 2.9.

Verse. 10. Ye that love the Lord] As having tasted of Christ's sweetness, being
justified by his merit, and sanctified by his Spirit, 1 Pet. 2.4 1 Cor. 6.11.
carried after him with strength of Desire, Psalm. 42.1. and Delight, Psalm.
73.25. Such as these only are Christ's true subjects; others will pretend to
him, but they are but Hangbies, unless the love of Christ constrain them to
hate evil, to hate it as Hell, (...)
Romans 12.9. Sin seems to have its name of Sana to hate (the word here used)
because it is most of all to be hated, as the greatest evil; as that which
sets us furthest from God the greatest good. This none can do but those that
love the Lord Christ in sincerity; for all hatred comes from love. A natural
man may be angry with his sin, as a man is sometimes with his wife or friend
for some present vexation; but hate it he cannot; yea he may leave it (for the
ill consequents of sin) but not loathe it. If he did, he would loathe all, as
well as any; for hatred is ever against the whole kind of a thing, says
Aristole. (...) Rhetor. lib. 2^


Verse. 11. Light is sown for the Righteous] The Righteous is haeres cruc ^^ the
Heir of the Cross; and many are his troubles. A Child of light may walk in
darkness and have no light, Isa 50.10. yet Christ will not leave him
comfortless, Joh. 14. Light is sown for him; it is yet seeding-time, and that
is usually wet and dropping; and the seed must have a time to lie, and then to
grow, ere a crop can be expected; there must be also weeding and clodding. etc.
behold the Husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has
long patience for it. By ye also patient, stablish your hearts, etc. Jam. 5.7,
8. We look not to sow and reap in a day, as He says of the Hyperborean people
far North, that they sow shortly after the Sunrising with them, and reap
before the Sun-ser, so: because the whole half year is one continual day with
them. Heresbach d^ rerust.
Deliverance will come in Gods good time; and as before the morning-light is
the thickest darkness; as the seed that lies longest under ground, comes up
at length with greatest increase, so here. Semen modicum, sed me ssis faecunda,
says Aben-Ezra on the Text.

And gladness for the upright] This clause expounds the former.

Verse. 12. Rejoice in the Lord] See Psalm. 32. ult. with the Note.

At the remembrance of his holinesse] That is, of himself; for whatsoever is in
God is God; as also of his works and benefits, whereby he gives you so good
occasion to remember him.

PSALM. XCVIII.
A Psalm] The Greek adds, of David; A man might think it were rather of John
Baptist pointing out Christ, and his Kingdom, as it already come, with the
great good thereby accrewing to the Saints.

Verse. 1. O sing unto the Lord a new song] See Psalm. 96.1. and observe how the
compiler of the Psalms has hereabout set together sundry Psalms of the same
subject.

His right hand and his holy arm] His is emphatical, and exclusive, q.d. Christ
alone has done the deed, he is our sole Savior, Isa. 59.16. and 63.5. In the
justification of a sinner, Christ and faith are alone, says Luther, Tanquam
sponsus and sponsa in thalamo. As Wax and Water cannot meet together, so
neither can Christ and any thing else in this work. Away then with that
devilish Doctrine of the Saints Merits, (...). Aristot, in Meteor.
Quibuscunque tandem pigmentis illita obtrudatur. If any commend or go after
any other way to Salvation besides Christ, he does according to the Greek
Proverb, draw mischiefs to himself; as the Wind Caecius does Clouds.

Verse. 2. The Lord has made known his salvation] His way of saving his people
by his Some Christ, Mat. 1.21. this Mystery, so long kept secret, is now made
known to all Nations for the obedience of faith, Rom, 16.25, 26.

His Righteousness] Made ours by imputation; this, the Jews to this day deride,
and the Papists call it putative, in a jeer.

Verse. 3. He has remembered his mercy, and his truth] His Mercy moving him to
promise, and his Truth binding him to perform, 2 Samuel 7.18, 21. and hence all
our happiness.

Verse. 4. Make a joyful noyse] Bless God for a Christ. The Argives when
delivered by the Romans from the tyranny of the Macedonians and Spartans, Quae
gaudia, quae vociferationes fuerunt? quid florum in Consulem profuderunt? what
great joys expressed they? what loud out-crys made they? the very Birds that
flew over them fell to the ground, Plut. in Flamin.
assonied with their noyses. They Crier at the Nemean Games was forced to
pronounce the word Liberty Iterumque iterumque again, and again.

Verse. 5. Sing unto the Lord with the Harp] Tum cithararum tum vocum mutuis
vicibus; do your utmost in the superlativest manner you can devise.

Verse. 6. Make a joyful noyse] By the repeating, and inculcating of this
exhortation is intimated our dullness, and backwardness to a business of this
nature; the necessity of the duty, and the excellency of the mercy that can
never be sufficiently celebrated.

Verse. 7, 8, 9. See the Notes on Psalm. 96.11, 12, 13.

PSALM. XCIX.
Verse. 1. The Lord reigneth] Even the Lord Christ, as Psalm. 97.1.

Let the people tremble] Let them serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with
trembling; by the people some understand the Jews, and by the Earth all other
Nations; let there be a general subjection yielded to the Scepter of his
Kingdom.

Verse. 2. The Lord is great in Zion] In his Church he gives many great
testimonies of his power and presence, and is therefore magnified by his people.

And he is high above all people] In the things wherein they deal proudly he is
above them, Exodus 18.11.

Verse. 3. Let them praise thy great and terrible Name] Nomen illud
Majestativum; Some hereby understand the name Jehovah, of which Josh. 7. What
will thou do to thy great Name? And Jer. 44. I have sworn by my great Name. But
Gods Name is usually put for Gods self.

For it is Holy] And therefore to be sanctified in righteousness, Isa. 5.16.

Verse. 4. The Kings strength also loves judgement] i.e. abest a Tyrannide. God
abuses not his Kingly power to Tyranny, but Joyneth it with his Justice and
Uprightnese. Regiment without Righteousness is but robbery with authority. The
Ara bick has it, Magnificentia Regis est, ut diligat aequitatem.

Verse. 5. Exalt the Lord our God] Have high apprehensions of him, and
answerable expressions: Set him up, and set him forth to the utmost.

And worship at his footstool] i.e. At his Temple, says the Chaldee: At the
Ark of the Covenant, say the Rabbis, Austin interprets it of Christ's
humanity; which although of it self, it is not to be adored, because it is a
creature, yet as it is received into unity of person with the Divinity, and
has a Partner-agency with the Godhead according to its measure in the works
of Redemption and Mediation, 1 Timothy 2.5. it is to be worshipped. But how hard
driven was that second Synod of Ni^e, when they abused this Text, among many
others, to prove the worshipping of Images and Pictures?

Verse. 6. Moses and Aaron among his Priests] or chief Officers, as 1 Chronicles.
18.17. Moses was, if not a Priest, yet a continual Intercessor for the people,
and a type of Christ the great Mediator of his Church. Aben-Ezra calls him
Cohen bacco^ani^^, the Priest of Priests; And Philo writing his life,
concludes, This was the life and death of Moses the King, the Lawgiver, the
prophet, and the chief Priest.

And Samuel] A man that could do much with God like wise, Jer 15.1. and is
therefore (as some conceive) called Pethuel, that is, a perswader of God, Joel.
1.1. Alsted.


Verse. 7. They kept his testimonies] And so showed that they called upon God
with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, Heb. 10.22.

Verse. 8. Thou wast a God, etc.] A sin pardoning God, Neb. 5^.17. So thou wast
to them under the Law, so thou will be to those under the Gospel.

Though thou tookest, etc.] Though Moses might no^ enter for his unbeleef, and
Samuel smarted for indulging his son^.

Verse. 9. Exalt the Lord] Versus amaelaus. See Verse. 5.

PSALM. C.
A Psalm of prcise] Suavis and gravis, short and sweet; appointed likely to be
sung at the Thank-offerings, quando pacifica erant offerende, say the Italian,
Levit. 7. ^^.
and Spanish annotators. See verse. 4. Enter with Thanksgiving, or with
Thank-sacrifice.

Verse. 1. All ye lands] Both Jews and Gentiles, Romans 15.10, 11. for your common
salvation.

Verse. 2. Serve the Lord with gladness] The Ca^balists have a Proverb, The Holy
Ghost sings not, but out of a glad heart. Cheerfulness is much called for in
both Testaments, God loves a cheerful server.

Verse. 3. Know ye that the Lord he is God] Be convinced of it, ye Heathens
whose fantasies have forged false gods; and ye Jews, acknowledge the true God
to be Three in One, and One in Three.

It is he that has mode us] And new made us; for we are his workmanship (a
second time) created in Christ Jesus unto good works. Ephesians. 2.10. The word
signifies, says Kimchi, Ornate beneficiis, afficere donis, gratiis cumula^e
(confer 1 Samuel 12.6.) and so is distinguished from Bar^ to create, and Ja^sar
to form. William of Malmsbury tells of a certain Emperor of Germany, who
coming by chance into a Church on the Sabbath day found there a most misshapen
Priest, pene portentum natura, insomuch as the Emperor much scorned and
contemned him: But when he heard him read those words in the Service, For it is
be^ that bath made us, and not we our selves; the Emperor checked his own proud
thoughts, and made in quiry into the quality and conditions of the man, and
finding, upon examination, that he was a very learned and devout man, he made
him Archbishop of Collen, which place he discharged with much commendations.

We are his people, and the sheep] See Psalm. 95.7. This is a privilege proper
to the Communion of Saints.

Verse. 4. Enter into his gates, etc.] As sheep into his sheepfolds, frequent
his public Ordinances, wait at the posts of the gates of Wisdom; there, as at
an heavenly Exchange, the Saints present duty, and God confers mercy.

Verse. 5. For the Lord is good] Though we be evil, he gives us all these good
things gra^^e; and although we provoke him daily to punish us, yet his mercy is
everlasting; like a fountain, it runs after it has run; And as the Sun
which shines after it has shined. See Zach, 13.1. Job. 1.27.

And his truth endures to all generations] Heb. to Generation and Generation.
He says, not for ever, says an Interpreter, because his promises are true,
but under a condition, which perhaps the following Generations will not
observe; The condition is to the promise as an Oar in a Boat, or stern of a
Ship, which turns it another way.

PSALM, CI.
A Psalm of David] Wherein he promises and pre-ingageth, that whenever he
came to the Kingdom, he will be a singular example both as a Prince, and as a
Master of a Family: In which respect this Psalm should be often read and
ruminated by such, that their houses may be as the house of David, Zach. 12.8.
and as the Palace of George Prince of Anba^^, which was, says Melanctben,
Ecclesia, Academia, Curia, a Church, Act. and Mon. fol. 1559.
an Academy, and a Court. Bishop Ridley read, and expounded this Psalm
oftentimes to his household, hiring them with money to learn it, and other
select Scriptures by heart. A good Governor is like that Nobleman who had for
his Impress two bundle of ripe Mi^^et bound together, with this M^tto, Servare
and Servari me^^ est; for the nature of the Mi^^et is both to guard it self
from all corruption, and also those things that lie near it. That is a rare
commendation that is given the late Reverend and Religious Dr. Chatterton, that
he was an housekeeper three and fifty years, and yet in all chat time, he
never kept any of his servants from Church to dress his meat, His life by Mr.
Clark.
saying, That he desired as much to have his servants know God, as himself.

Verse. 1. I will-sing of Mercy and Judgement]^ David's Ditty was composed of
discords. Mercy and Justice are the brightest stars in the sphere of Majesty;
the main supports of a Throne Royal: How heit there should be a pre-eminence to
Mercy; as one well observes from Micah 6.8. Mercy must be loved, and not shown
only: Justice must be done, and no more. The sword of Justice, must be bathed
in the oil of Mercy; A well-tempered mixture of both, preserves the
Commonwealth, Romans 13.34.

Unto thee, O Lord, will I sing] Acknowledge thee alone, the bestower of these
graces and thy glory ^s the end. These are matters that Philosophers and
Politicians mind not.

Verse. 2. I will behave my self wisely] I will begin the intended reformation
at my self, and then set things to rights in my family, which while Augustus
did not, he was worthily blamed by his subjects, and told, that public persona
must carefully observe, Aedibus in pr^priis quae recta (...) prava gerantur.
Plu^^


Cate said, that he could pardon all men's faults, but his own. But Cate the
wise, wanted the wisdom from above, and was therefore short of David, who
promises here so be merry, I will sing, and yet wise, I will behave my self
wisely in a perfect way; that is, in an upright conversation, and in a faithful
discharge of the great trust committed unto me.

O^ when wilt then come unto me?] In the performance of thy promise concerning
the Kingdom? For I am resolved not to ^^^evert thee, but to wait thy coming;
Est suspirium (...) ex abrupto, like that of Ju^^^, I have waited, O Lord; for
thy salvation Genesis 49, 18. Or, When will thou come, viz. to reckon with me? For
come thou wiles

I wilt walk within my house with a perfect heart] And although my house ^^ not
s^ with God, 1 Samuel 23.5. yet this is all my desire (and shall be mine
endeavor) although be make it not to grow, ib. Indesinentes ^m^ulabo. Kimchi.
I will walk uncessantly, walk in the midst of mine house, (...) 2 King. 4.35.
and this I will do in the (...) of mine heart* for that a man is in truth, that
he is at home. Follow hypocrites home to their houses, and there you shall see
what they are. Look upon Stage Players, and you may see them act the parts of
Kings and honest men; but follow them to their tyring-houses, and there they
are but base Varlets.

Verse. 3. I will set no wicked thing (Heb. thing of Belial) before mine eyes]
that is, in my thoughts, says Kimchi; for the thinking-faculty is in the
forepart of the brain, as are also the eyes. I will not gaze upon forbidden
objects, nor venture upon a temptation to, or an occasion of sin. I will also
be wise and wary in the choice of my servants, and underofficers. Theodosius
his Court was virtutu^^ officina, non vitior^m sentina, says One. And
Archbishop Granniers house was Schola vet palaestra pieta^^^ and literarum,
Pare us. Tremellius.
says another. See above on the title of this Psalm.

I hate the work of them that turn aside] Of treacherous men and Apostates;
Eusebius.
such as Constantius Chlorus, the Father of Constamine the Great sound (by
proof made) some of his Counselors and Courtiers to be, and therefore turned
them off, saying, He cannot be faithful to me, who is unfaithful to God:
Pietate sublata fides to llitur.

It shall not cleave to mee] I Will none of them, neither shall any such
wickedness hang at my heels, to hinder my progress in piety and good government.

Verse. 4. A froward heart shall depart from me] i.e. say some, I will endeavor
to put off the old man with the lusts thereof, Ephesians. 4 22. the old crooked frame
shall be dissolved, and a better erected. I will not know evil, that is,
regard, or allow it, Psalm. 1.6. Others understand the Text of rotten-hearted,
and wicked Counselors, whom David would abhor and abandon.

Verse. 5. Whose privily slandereth his neighbour] Heb. Him that in secret,
tongue-smiteth his fellow-friend, will I suppress. This David purposed to do,
but this he did not so thoroughly in the case of poor Mepbibes^eth, belyed by
false Zita; his resolution was Maledices and maleficot a se depellere, to drive
away from him sycophants, back-byters, Sorices and tineas palatii appellabat
Constan. Mag.
flatteres; but there is a great sympathy betwixt Princes, and such Pests,
those Harpye^, and gaping Crows of Courts, as one calls them. David promises
fair to purge and disempester his house and Court of such, and to cut them off,
secundum leges regni, according to the Laws of the Kingdom, as Aben-Ezra
glosseth.

Him that bath ax bigh look] Pride will sit and show it self in the eyes as soon
as any where. A man is seen what he is, in oculis, in poculis, in loculis, say
the Rabbis, See Prove. 6.17.

And a proud heart] Heb. a wide, or broad heart, that thinks great things of
himself, and seeks great things for himself.

I will not suffer] Heb. I will not, sc. away with, or endure at any hand. The
Greeks, Leguntocal pro ucal.
and after them others read, I will not eat with them; and by large of heart,
they understand belly-gods, men of large appetites, such as were the two sons
of Eli, Belialists, and Hellicones.

Verse. 6. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land] i.e. Let them live
where they will, I will hearken them out, and find them out. The Rabbis say,
that here David repents him of taking into his service and tuition those
indebted and discontented persons, men of broken fortunes, and loose manners, 1 Samuel 22.1, 2. and resolves to be better advised in the choosing and using of
his retinue, when he comes to the Kingdom, that his Court might be like that
of Cyrus, whereof Xenophon says, Cyrop. l. 8
that though a man should seek or choose blindfold, he could not miss of a good
man. Zonaras mainly commends Valentinian the first, and Les Armenius,
Emperors, for their good choice of both Civil and Military Officers. He
condemns as much Macyinus for the contrary.

He shall serve me] (...) he shall be of honorable employment about me, as
Joseph was to Pharaoh, Cromwell to Hen. 8. his Vicar General.

Verse. 7. He that works deceit shall not dwell in my house] If I may know him
to be such an one, I shall soon cashiere him, and serve him as Philip of
Macedon afterward did two of his evil servants; the one whereof he compelled
to run out of his Country, and the other to drive him. David was not guarded
and surrounded, as many Princes are now adays, Mag^^ ^^gmine Ai^^^^, Nego^^m,
Gan^o^^m, Palpenum, Gnathenum, Balatrenum.

He that tells lies shall not t^rry in my sight] Liars are frequent in
Courts; as in Saul's, and do much mischief. The good Emperor Aurelius was much
abused by them. Lewis the eleventh of France complained that he had plenty of
all things, but of only one: And being asked of what? O^ truth quoth he.
Augustus took on exceedingly, when Va^^ was slain in battle, and gave this for
a reason, Quod non esset a quo verum oudire^, because he had not now a friend
from whom he could hear the truth of things.

Verse. 8. Indefinenter regnum, regiam Ecclesiamque purgabo ^ malo, Trem.
I will early destroy all the wicked of the land.] All, without partiality, and
beti^^s, in Matutinis, without delay, making it my mornings work to do justice;
for then was judgment executed, Jer. 21.12. Or, I will do it daily, and as
duly as the house is swept. See Lam. 3.23.

That I may cut off all wicked doers from the City of God] All the notorious
Deboysheers from the Church; that I may weed out those wicked ones, those
Trouble-towns, those Desper^does, the botches of humane society. And here David
describes the utmost and chief end of Civil Government (that which the
Philosophers never dreamed of) viz. That God may be purely and sincerely served
in his City, that is, in his Church.

PSALM. CII.
A Prayer of the afflicted] Or, for the afflicted, made by Daniel, or some
other Prophet, not long before the return out of Babylon, where they suffered
much, but prayed little, as Daniel confesses, Chap. 9.13. Here therefore they
are taught to take unto them words, and say, Hear my prayer, O Lord, etc. In
greatest afflictions there is place left for prayer, Psalm. 103.1. and something
God will yield to it, when most bitterly bent against a people, Mat. 24.20, 21.

When he is overwhelmed] Pressed out of measure above strength, 2 Cor. 1.8. ad
deliquium animae, till heart faint, and faith seem to fail, bowing down through
weight of grief, at si pars una corporis alia esset operta; for so the word
here used signifies, says Kimchi, as if one part of the body were overcovered
with another Estque pulchra collatis in verbi^ gnataph and shaphac quae naturam
fidei deping unt, says Mollerus: Faith may be under a cloud for a season; but
it will recover, and pour out its complaint before the Lord.

Verse. 1. Hear my prayer, O Lord] O Lord Christ, for so this Psalm is to be
understood, as the Apostle shows, Heb. 1.

And let my cry] Which is, that thou would be pleased to bring us poor
exiles back to our own Country; and so this prayer is answerable to that of
Daniel, Chap. 9.

Verse. 2. Hide not thy face from me] For this would be worse than all the rest.
See Jer. 16.13. I will cast you cut of this land-and I will show you no favor:
This last was a cutting speech, and far worse than their captivity; and yet,
Non exul curae dicitur esse De^.

Answer me speedily] Festina, responde: In our earnest prayers we may press for
expedition in general, not tying God to any particular time, as those
Bethulians did in the book of Judith.

Verse. 3. For my days are consumed like smoak] Which the higher it mounteth,
the sooner it vanishes. Some read it, in the smoke So Psalm. 119.83. I am
become like a bottle in the smoke, dried and withered, (...)

And (...) bones are burnt as an hearth] Ossae mea quasi fri^^ conta^^er^^^. My
strength is gone. Vel^^l sartagi^^^ Arah.
Here, to the twelfth verse, is a most lively picture of a dejected person,
such as can hardly be paralleld; teaching us to be deeply affected with the
Churches afflictions.

Verse. 4. My heart is smitten] Blasted with thins indignation, that ventus
urent and ^xi^ans.

So that I forget eat my bread] I am ^^^achless, through want of that beat
heart should supply.

Verse. 5. By reason of the voice of my (...)] A broken spirit dries the bones.
Prove. 17.22. and by drinking up the marrow and radical moisture, cas^eth all
into a consumption.

Verse. 6. I am like a (...)] Or (...) which lives in lonely pla^^^^, and
cries ou^ (...)

I am like an Owl of the Desert:] Avis lutifuga, Night-bird, a Night-raven, the
Vulgar has it; others, a Bat, a Cuccow, but most an Owl, that noctis monstr^^,
as Pliny speaks of her, net cantu aliqu^ vocales sedge^itu, hated of all
other fouls, Lib. 10. cap.
which never come near her, but to keep a wondering at her.

Verse. 7. I watch] I can as little sleep, as eat, verse. 4. That nurse of
nature, and sweet Parenthesi^ of men's griefs and cares, sleep departs from
me, Nec membris dat curas^p^rem.

And am as a sparrow] That has lost his mate, so have I mine associater, which
is a sore loss; for optimum solatium sodalitium,

Verse. 8. Mine enemies reproach me all the day] This is an evil that man's
nature is most impatient of. See Psalm. 137.

And they that are mad against me] That let fly at me^ or, that once praised
me, flattered me^ So the Sept.

Are sworn against me] Have sworn my death, or do swear and curse by me, as the
Turks do at this day, when to confirm a truth they say, Judaeus sim si sallam,
I would I were a Jew, it is so. See Zach. 8.13. Isa. 6.15. Jer. 29.22. God make
thee as Abab, and as Zedechiah, etc.

Verse. 9. For I have eaten ashes like bread] Being cast on the ground as a
mourner, I know not whether I eat bread or dust; this relisheth to me as well
as that, my mouth is so out of taste.

And mingled my drink with weeping] I forbear not to weep, no not while I
drank; sorrow is dry, and wine drives away sorrow we say; Not so from me. Wine
is call by Simon ide^ in Athonaeu^ (...), an expeller o^ sadness. De coelo in
terram. R. Solom.


Verse. 10. Because of thine indignation] This lay heavier upon the good man's
heart than all the rest, God was displeased.

For thou bast lifted me up, and cast me down] That is, that I might fall with
the greater poise. Significatur gravissima collisie. Here the Prophet accuses
not God of cruelty, but bewayleth his own misery; Miserum est suisse felicem,
It is no small unhappiness to have been happy.

Verse. 11. My days are like a shadow that declineth] As at Sunset, the
shadows are at longest, but not long lasting.

And I am withered like grass] Mown down, and laid a drying.

Verse. 12. But thou, O Lord, shall endure for ever] And therefore we thy
Covenanters shall be restored, Lam. 5.19.

And thy remembrance] Which thou have of us, and we of thee.

Verse. 13. Thou shall arise, and have mercy upon Sion] This he speaks with
as much confidence, as if he had been in Gods bosom; for he knew the promise
of deliverance, after seventy years captivity. See the like Hab. 1.12.

For the time to favor her, etc.] This he understood by books, as Dan. 9.2.
and therefore presses God to a speedy performance. God loves to be burdened
with his own word, to be sued upon his own bond, etc. But besides the promise,
the Psalmist had another ground of his confidence, and that is in the next.

Verse. 14. For thy servants take pleasure in her stones] They pity he^, and
wish her welfare, much more then do thou. He argues from that sweet,
tender, melting frame of spirit that was found in the faithful, which is but a
reflex of that farsweeter that is in God.

And savor the dust thereof] Theruines and the rubbish, heartily desiring, and
expecting a re-edification, and restoration, whereof they had a sweet promise,
Am. 9.9. and for the spiritual Temple to be built of Jews and Gentiles, they
had many more. See all that follows.

Verse. 15. So the beathen shall fear, etc.] By the restoration of Jerusalem
where the Messiah was to be born and manifested, the everlasting Gospel shall
be preached, and the Gentiles converted to the faith.

And all the Kings of the earth] Caught by those Fishermen, and their
successors in the Ministry.

Verse. 16. When the Lord shall build up Zion] Isaiah had foretold that the
second Temple should be more glorious than the first, Isa. 54.11. and 60.17.
the stones whereof, were types of those living stones whereof that spiritual
Temple was to be built, 1 P^t. 2.5. and wherein God would manifest more of his
glory than ever li^ had done in all the world besides.

Verse. 17. Humilesque Myticae. Virg.
He will regard the prayer of the destitute] Heb. Of the poor shrub, tha is in
the wilderness trod upon by beasts, unregarded, worthless: Heath, Juniper, t
Wild Ta mar^k; Tremelli^^ renders it Nudatissimi; Others Excitantis se, the
prayer of one that stirs up himself to take hold of God, and thereby
prevails with him. I came for thy prayer, says the Angel to Daniel, chap.
10.12.

Verse. 18. This shall be written for the generation to come] This, that the
poor shrub has sped so well in prayer; together with all other the particulars
of this Psalm, and indeed the whole Scripture, Romans 15.4. So little truth is
there in that assertion of the Jesuits, that the Epistles of the Apostles were
intended only for the use of those Churches, or persons, to whom they were
first written.

And the people which shall be created] Created in Christ Jesus unto good
works, Ephesians. 2.10. Isa. 51.16.
his regenerated people; For God planteth the heavens, and lays the
foundations of the earth, that be may say to Zion, Thou art my people.

Verse. 19. For he has looked down from the height, etc.] This is no small
condescension; since he abaseth himself to look upon things in heaven, Psalm.
113.6.

From heaven did the Lord behold the earth] That is, his poor despised
servants, that are in themselves no better than the earth they tread on.

Verse. 20. To hear the groaning of the prisoner] Those prisoners of hope held
so long captive in Babylon, the cruelty whereof is graphically described, Jer.
51.34.

Verse. 21. To declare the Name of the Lord in Zion] This shall be the business
of the converted Gentiles, to make up one Catholic Church with the Christian
Jews, and to bear a part in setting forth Gods worthy praises. See verse. 18.

Verse. 22. When the people are gathered together] sc. to the Lord Christ; For
to Shil^^ shall be the gathering of the people, Genesis 49.10.

And the Kingdoms to serve the Lord] As they did under Constantine the Great,
Valentinian, Theodosius, which three Emperors called themselves, Vasalles
Christi (as Socrates reports) the Vassals of Christ: And the like may be said
of other Christian Kings and Princes since, who have yielded professed
subjection to the Gospel, and cast their Crowns at Christ's feet.

Verse. 23. He wea^ned my strength in the way] This is the complaint of the poor
captives yet undelivered, In via, hoc est in vita; quia bic sumus viatores, in
coelo comprehensores, here we are but on our way to heaven, and we meet with
many discouragements.

He shortened my dayes] viz. According to my account, For otherwise in respect
of God, our days are numbered. Stat sua cuique dies.

Verse. 24. Take me not away in the midst of my dayes] Heb. Make me not to
ascend, Serus in coelum redeam. Fain I would live to see those golden days of
Redemption. Abraham desired to see the day of Christ, Job. 8. Simeon did, and
then sang out his soul. All the Saints after the Captivity, looked hard for the
consolation of Israel.

Thy years are throughout all generations] And that is the comfort of thy poor
Covenanters, who are sure to participate of all thy goods.

Verse. 25. Of old thou have laid the foundation, etc.] Here is a clear proof of
Christ's eternity; Heb. 1.10. because he was before the creation of the world,
and shall continue after the consummation thereof, verse. 26, 27. So the Saints
a part pest, 1 Job. 2.17. The world passes away, and the lusts thereof; but
he that does the will of God abides for ever.

Verse. 26. They shall perish] i.e. They shall change form and state, being
dissolved by the last fire, 2 Pet. 3.7, 10.

But thou shall end^re] Heb. Stand, and with thee thy Church, Mat. 22.32.

Yea all of them shall wax old as a garment] Which wears in the wearing; so
do the visible heavens and the earth, what ever some write, de constantia
naturae, Isaiah says, It rotteth as a book (that is vener andae rubigini^ and
wastes away as smoke, chap. 65.17. and 66.22. (...). Tucetu, Arab.


At a vesture shall thou change them] The Greek has roll them, confer Isa. 34
4.

Verse. 27. But thou art the same] Therefore immutable, because Eternal, ut
nihil tibi possit accedere vel decidere.

Verse. 28. The children of thy servants shall continue] By virtue of the
Covenant, and that union with thee which is the ground of communion. If it
could be said of Caesar, that he held nothing to he his own that he did not
communicate to his friends, how much more of Christ? Propterea been semper
sperandum, etiamsi (...) ruant, the Church is immortal, and immutable.

PSALM. CIII.
A Psalm of David] Which he wrote when carried out of himself, as far as
heaven, says Beza; and therefore calls not upon his own soul only, but upon
all creatures from the highest Angel, to the lowest worm, to set forth Gods
praises.

Verse. 1. Bless the Lord, O my soul] Agedum animul^ mi, and intima mea visera.
A good man's work lies most within doors; he is more taken up with his own
heart, than with all the world besides; neither can he ever be along so long as
he has God and his own soul to converse with. David's Harp was not of^ner out
of tune, than his heart, which here he is setting right, that he may the better
make melody to the Lord. Music is sweet, but the setting of the strings in
tune is unpleasing; so is it harsh to set out hearts in order, which yet must
be done, and thoroughly done, as here.

And all that is within me] All my faculties and senses. The whole soul and
body must be set a work in this service; the judgment to set a right estimate
upon mercies; the memory to recognize and retain them, Dent. 6 11, 12. and
8.14. the Will which is the proper seat of thankfulness; the affections, love,
desire, joy, confidence, all must be actuated, that our praises may be
cordial, vocal, vital. In peace offerings God called for the sat and inwards.

Verse. 2. Bless the Lord, O my soul] David found some dullness and drowsiness;
hence he so often puts the thorn to the breast; hence he so impe^^ously
instigateth his soul, as One shere phraseth it.

And forget not all his benefits] Forgetfulness is a grave; look to it: Eaten
bread is soon forgotten with us, as it is with children; (...). Pin^u.
neither perishes any thing so soon with many as a good turn. Alphonsus King
of Arragon professed that he wondered not so much at his Courtiers ingratitude
to him (who had raised many of them from mean, to great estates, which they
little remembered) as at his own to God.

Verse. 3. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities] David not only takes upon him
with an holy imperiousness, laying Gods charge upon his soul to be thankful;
but intending to show himself good cause why to be so, he worthily begins
with remission of fin, as a complexive mercy, and such as comprehends all the
rest. He had a Crown of pure gold set upon his head, Psalm. 21. But here he
blesses God for a better Crown, verse. 4. Who crowns thee with loving
kindness, etc. And how was this Crown set on his head, but by forgiving all his
iniquities?

Who heals all thy diseases] Corporal and spiritual. Quod sani^as in corpore
id sanctitas in cord: Jehovah Rophe, or the Lord the Physician (as he is
called Exodus 15.26. cures His people on both fides, makes them whole every
whit. See Isa. 19.22. Mat. 8.17. He bore out diseases.

Verse. 4. Who redeemeth thy life from destruction] From hell, says the
Chaldee, from a thousand deaths and dangers every day. All this Christ our kind
kinsman does for us, dying virtually as ost as we offend.

WhO crowns thee with loving kindness, etc.] Incircleth and surroundeth thee
with benefits, so that which way soever thou turnest thee, thou can not look
beside a blessing. See the Note on verse. 3.

Verse. 5. Who satisfies thy mouth] Heb. Thy jaws, so that thou art top full,
eating as long as eating is good: God allows thee an honest affluence of
outward comforts^ Open thy mouth wide, and he will fill it, Psalm. 81.10.

So that thy youth is ^e^^ed like the Eagles] The Eagle is of all birds the
most vegetous and vivacious, renewing her youth and health, they say, at every
ten years end, by casting her old feathers, and getting new, till she be an
hundred years old. Aquisae senectus. Prover^^
Augustins observes that when her bill is overgrown that she cannot take in
her meat, she beats it against a rock, and so ex^^it (...) ro^^^i, she
strikes off the combersome part of her bill, and thereby recovereth her
eating. That which hinders our renovation, says he, the Rock Christ takes
away, etc. See Isa. 40.31.

Verse. 6. The Lord (...) etc.] The words are both plural to show that God will
execute omnimodam justitiam and judicium, all, and all manner of justice and
judgment, relieving the oppressed, and punishing the oppressor to the sull.

Verse. 7. He made known his ways unto Moses] Even right Judgments, true Laws,
good Statutes, and Commandments, Neh. 9.13, 14. The Rabbis by ways here,
understand Gods Attributes and Properties ( Middoth they call them) those
thirteen proclaimed, Exodus 34. after that Moses had prayed, Exodus 33. Show me
thy ways; and the next words favor this interpretation.

Verse. 8. The Lord is merciful and gracious] These are Moses his very
expressions, Exodus 34.7. Theodoret calls him worthily, The great Ocean of
Divinity, etc.

His acts to the children] His miracles in Egypt, and all along the wilderness,
where they sed upon Sacraments.

Verse. 9. He will not always chide] His still revenges are terrible, Genesis 6.3.
with 1 Pet. 3.19. but God being appeased toward the penitent people, will not
show his anger so much as in words, Isa. 57.16.

Neither will be keep his anger for ever] Much less must we, Levit. 19.18. Ephesians.
4.26. though against his enemies God is expressly said to keep it, Nab. 1.2.

Verse. 10. He has not dealt with us after our sins] Heb. Our errors, our
involuntary and unavoidable infirmities.

According to our iniquities] Heb. perversely committed: for of these evils also
the Saints are not free; but God bea^eth with more than small faults,
especially if not scandalous.

Verse. 11. For as the heaven is high above the earth] How high the third heaven
is cannot be conjectured. But for the middlemost heaven (wherein the Sun, Moon,
and Stars, are placed) how exceeding high it is may be guessed and gathered, in
that the Stars (whereof those of the first magnitude, are said to be every one
above a hundred and seven times as big again as the whole earth) do yet seem to
us but as so many sparks or spangles. See Prove. 25.3. Ephesians. 4.10.

So great is his mercy] The heavens are exceeding high above the earth, but
Gods mercy to his is above the heavens, Psalm. 108.4. The original word Gabbar
here used, is the same with that Genesis 7.20. used for the prevailing of the
waters above the mountains.

Verse. 12. As far as the East, etc.] And these we know to be so far asunder,
that they shall never come together. The space also and distance of these two
is the greatest that can be imagined, Deuteronomy. 4.32. Psalm. 113.3. Isa. 45.6.

So far has be removed out transgressions] The guilt of them, whereby a man
stands charged with the fault, and is obliged to the punishment due thereunto.
See Isa. 43.25. and 38.17 Mic. 7.19. Ezeck. 33.16. Peccata non redeunt.
Discharges in Justification, are not repealed, called in again.

Verse. 13. Like as a Father pitieth] There is an ocean of love in a fathers
heart: See Luke 15.20. Genesis 33.2, 13, 14. and Chap. 4.3. how hardly, and with
what caution Jacob parted with Benjamin. Sozomen makes mention of a certain
Merchant, who offering himself to be put to death for his two sons who were
sentenced to dye, Lib. 7. cap. 24.
and it being granted that one of the two (whom he should choose) should be upon
that condition delivered; the miserable Father, aequali utriusque amore victus,
equally affected to them both, could not yield that either of them should dye,
but remained hovering about both, till both were put to death.

So the Lord pitieth etc.] So and ten thousand times more than so; For he is
the Father of all mercies, Parentela.
and the Father of all the Father-beeds in heaven and earth, Ephesians. 3.15.

Verse. 14. For he knows our frame] Our evil concupiscence says the Chaldee;
Figulinam and fragilem constitutionem nostram, says Junius, that we are
nothing better than a compound of dire and sin.

He remembers th^^ we are dust] Our bodies are (for our souls are of a
spiritual nature, divinae particula aurae) and sooner or later to be turned to
dust again.

Verse. 15. As for man, his days are at grass] The frailty of man's life
intimated in the former verse is here lively painted out under the similitude
of grass, as likewise in many other Scriptures. See Psalm. 37.2. and 90.5.6. etc.

As a slower of the field, so be flourisheth] Take him in all his ga^ety, his
beauty, and his bravery, he is but as a flower; and that not of the garden,
which has more shelter and better ordering, but of the field; and so more
subject to heat, weather, p^lling (...) or treading down, Isa. 40.6, 7, 8.

Verse. 16. For the wind passes over it, and it is gone] Heb. It is not; that
is, it neither continues any longer in being, nor returns any more into being:
So here. Job 14.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

And the place thereof shall know it no more] Though whilst it stood and
flourished, the place of is seemed as it were to know nothing but it; the glory
and beauty of it drew all eyes to it, etc. Think the same of men in their
flourish, soon forgotten, as dead men out of mind, Psalm. 31.12.

Verse. 17. But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting] God is from all
eternity, and unto all eternity kind to all that fear him, in what age of the
world soever they live.

And his righteousness unto childrens children] That is, his kindness or
bounty; for so the word Tsedac^ah should be taken, according to Psalm. 112.3, 9.
2 Cor. 9.9.

Verse. 18. To such as keep his Covenant] For else they shall know Gods breach
of promise, as it is Numb. 14.3, 4. Neither shall it benefit them to have been
born of godly parents.

And to those that remember his Commandements] That resolve to do them, though
in many things they fail, Qui faciunt praetepta etiams^ non perficiant, that
wish well to that which they can never compass, Psalm. 119.4, 5. If they cannot
open the door, yet if they give a pluck at the bolt, or a lift at the latch,
there is comfort.

Verse. 19. The Lord has prepared] Or fixed, founded, firmed, established. Here
God is further praised for his most excellent Majesty, which appears first,
From the loftiness of his Throne; secondly, From the largeness of his Dominion.

Verse. 20. Bless the Lord, ye his Angels] In stirring up the Angels to praise
God, he awakeneth himself; and for this purpose, Incipit a superioribus, and
finit in infimis, says Kimcbi here, he calls in the help of all the
creatures from the highest to the lowest; and after all, concludes as he began
with a saying to himself.

That excel in strength] Heb. Giants for strength, such as can prevail, and do
great exploits, yet is all their strength derivative, they have it from God
(who it Hagibbor, the Mighty One, Deuteronomy. 10.17.) and hence the Angel Gabriel
has his name, God is my strength. Labor we to be like unto the Angels,
strengthened with all might etc. Col. 1.11. walking about the world as
Conquerors, able to do all things through Christ who strengthens us, Philip.
4.13.

That do his Commandements] viz. Cheerfully, speedily, universally, humbly,
constantly. Let us do accordingly, else we mock God when we pray, Thy will be
done in earth, as it is in heaven.

Verse. 21. Bless ye the Lord all his hosts] That is, all his creatures, which
are fitly called Gods hosts, First, For their number; Secondly, For their
order; thirdly, for their obedience.

Ye Ministers of his] Whether in State or Church. Kings are Gods Ministers.
Romans 13.4, 6. So are Angels, Heb. 1.14. like as Ministers are Angels, Rev. 2.1.
they have exchanged names, their office is Angel-like, to wait upon God, to
stand before him, to serve in his presence, and to bless his Name.

Verse. 22. Bless the Lord all his works] Whether living or liveless; For all
thy works praise thee, O Lord, and thy Saints bless thee, Psalm. 145.10.
Benedicite ter, ad mysterium Triadis, says an Interpreter.

Bless the Lord, O my soul] Whatever others do, let me be doing at it, as Josh.
24.14, 15.

PSALM. CIV.
Verse. 1. Bless the Lord, O my soul] This was much in David's mouth, as Deo
gratias was in Austines. See Psalm. 103.1, and 22. after which this Psalm is
fitly set. There he blesses God for his benefits to himself, and the whole
Church, here for his works of Creation and Government common to the whole
world. (...),
The Greek and Latin Translations prefix this title, David de generation:
Mandi, Continet opera Bereshith, says Kimchi. It is of the same subject with
the first Chapter of Genesis, the first five days works are here after a sort
considered, and celebrated, as a mirror wherein Gods Majesty may be clearly
discerned. This Psalm is by some called, David's Physics.

Thou art very great] Non molis dimension^, sed virtutis and rerum gestarum
gloria; Thou have made thee a great Name by thy works of wonder.

Thou are clothed with Honor and Majesty] i.e. With thy creatures, which are
as a garment both to hide thee in one respect, and to hold thee forth in
another, to be seen.

Verse. 2. Who coverest thy self with light] That lovely creature that first
shone out of darkness, and is chief among all things sensible, as coming nearest
to the unapproachable glory of God; like as the robe royal is next unto the
King. Herod upon a let day came forth arrayed in royal apparel, in cloth of
silver, says Josephus, which being beaten upon by the Sunbeams, dazzled the
eyes of the people, and drew from them that blasphemous acclamation, Act.
12.21. God when he made the world, showed himself in all his royalty; neither
can we ascribe too much unto him.

Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain] The whole expanse or firmament
is as a Canopy over Gods Throne, or rather as a Curtain or Skreen betwixt us
and the Divine Majesty, the fight whereof we cannot bear.

Verse. 3. Who lays the beams of his chambers in the waters] God, as he has
founded the solid earth upon the fluid waters, Psalm. 24.2. So the highest
heaven upon those waters above the firmament, Genesis 1.7. Psalm. 18.11. This
notably sets forth the wisdom and power of this Almighty Architect, since
Artists say, In solido extruendum, the foundation of a building should be hard
and rocky, and experience seals to it.

Who makes the clouds, etc.] These are his Chariot royal, drawn (or rather
driven) by the winds, as his Charriot-horses.

Verse. 4. Who makes his Angels spirits] Immaterial substances, fit to attend
upon the Father of spirits, and with speed to move suddenly and invisibly into
most remote parts.

His Ministers a flaming fire] Seraphims they are called for their burning
zeal, like so many heavenly Salamanders; as also for their irrestible power;
the Angel that destroyed Sennacheribs. Army is held to have done it by burning
them within, although it appeared not outwardly, as some have been burnt by
lightning.

Verse. 5. Who laid the foundations of the earth] Heb. He has founded the earth
upon her bases. See Psalm. 24.2. Job 38.4, 6. with the Notes.

That is should not be removed for ever] Neither can it be, by reason of its
own weightiness, whereby it remains unmovable in the center of the universe.
Say it should move any way it must move toward heaven, and so ascend, which is
utterly against the nature of heavy bodies.

Verse. 6. Thou coverest it with the deep as with a garment] Operueras, Thou
had at first covered it, till thou for man's sake had made a distinction;
for else such a garment would this have been to the earth, as the shirt made
for the murdering of Agamemnon, where he had no issue out.

The waters stood above the mountains] As the garment, in the proper use of it,
is above the body; and so they would still, did not God for our sakes set them
their bounds and borders.

Verse. 7. At thy rebuke they fled] At thy word of command and angry
countenance, overawing that raging and ranging creature; So Christ rebuked the
winds and waves.

They hasted away] They ran away headlong, as for life.

Verse. 8. They go up by the mountains] They run any way in post hasle, breaking
through thick and thin, and no where resting, till imbodied in the Abyss,
their elemental place and station. This is check to our dullness, and
disobedience. If a man had been present, says One, when God thus commanded the
seas to retreat from the earth, he might have seen both a terrible, and a
joyful spectacle.

Verse. 9. Thou have set a bound, etc.] A certain compass and course, an
argument of Gods singular and sweet power and providence. See Job 38.10, 11.
with the Notes.

Verse. 10. He sondeth the springs into the vallies] God does this; he by
certain issues or ven^s sends forth the waters of the Sea, (which here and
there break out in springs, leaving their saltness behind them) that men and
other earthly creatures might have that (...) (as Pindar^^ ^iseth it) for the
satisfying of their thirst, and for other necessary uses. This is David's
Philosophy, and his son Solomon says the same, Eccles. 1.7. Though Aristotle
assign another cause of the perennity of the fountains and rivers.

Verse. 11. They give drink to every beast] A great mercy, as we have lately
found in these late dry years, 1653, 1654. wherein God has given us to know
the worth of water by the want of it; Bona sunt a tergo formosissima.

The wild-asses] Those hottest creatures, Job 39.8, 9, 10, 11.

Verse. 12. By them shall the souls of the heaven] Assuetae ripis volueres, and
fluminis alve^. Virg.

clouds, dropping fatness.

Verse. 14. He causes the grass to grow for the cattel] He caused it to grow
at first, before cattle were created, Genesis 1.11, 12. And so he does still, as
the first cause; by rain and dew from heaven, as the second cause.

And herb for the service of man] Ad esum and ad usum, for food, physic, etc.
Genesis 1.29. Green herbs, it seems, was a great dish with the Ancients, which
therefore they called Holus, ab (...) Aristippus told his Fellow-Philosopher
who fed upon them, If you can please Dionysius, you need not eat green herbs.
He presently replied, If you can eat green herbs, you need not please
Dionysius, and be his Parasite.

That he may bring forth food out of the earth] Alma parens Tellus. Labor not
for the meat that perishes, but for the meat. etc. Job. 6.37.

Verse. 15. And wine that makes glad] That he may the more cheerfully serve
his Maker, his heart being listed up, as Jehosaphats was, in the ways of
obedience, Judge. 9 13. Prove. 31.6, 7.

And oil to make his face to shine] The word signifies Ointments of all sorts,
whereof see Pliny lib. 12. and 13. These, man might want and subsist; But God
is bountiful.

And bread which strengthens, etc.] In nature, Animantis cujusque vita est
fuga; were it not for the repair of nutrition, the natural life would be
extinguished. The Latins call bread Panis, of the Greek (...); be cause it is
the chief nourishment.

Verse. 16. The trees of the Lord are full of sap] Heb. are satisfied, viz. with
moisture sucked by their roots out of the earth plentifully watered, whereby
they are nourished, grow mightily, and serve man for meat, drink, medicine, etc.

The Cedars of Lebanon] These are instanced as tallest and most durable. Gods
Temple at Jerusalem was built of them; and so was the D^vils temple at Ephesus,
for he will needs be Gods Ape.

Verse. 17. Where the birds make their nests] Each, according to their natural
instinct, with wonderful art.

As for the Stork] That Pietaticultri^, as Petronius calls her (and her name
in Hebrew sounds as much) because she nourishes and cherishes the old ones
whereof she came; whence (...). Genetricum senectam invicem educant. Plin.
Ciconiis pietas eximia inest, Solin.


Verse. 18. The high hills are a refuge] These wild, but weak creatures are so
wise, as to secure themselves from violence, when pursued they run to their
refuges, and should not we to God, for the securing of our comforts, and
safe-guarding of our persons?

Verse. 19. He appointed the Moon for seasons] Most Nations reckoned the year by
the Moon, rather than by the Sun.

The Sun knows his going down] As if he were a living and intelligent
creature; so justly does he observe the Law laid upon him by God, and runs
through his work. See Job 38.12.

Verse. 20. Thou make darkness] Which though it be dreadful, yet is it useful,
and in the vicissitude of light and darkness, much of Gods wisdom and goodness
in to be seen, We must see that we turn not the day into night, nor night into
day, without some very special, and urgent occasion.

Verse. 21. The young Lions roar] Rousing themselves out of their dens by night;
and then usually seizing upon what prey God sends them in; for they are at
his, and not at their own finding.

And seek] Like as the young Ravens cry to him, Psalm. 147. implication only.
See Joel 1.18, 20.

Verse. 22. They gather themselves together] viz. into their dens and lurking
holes, smitten with fear of light, and of men. A sweet providence, but little
considered.

Verse. 23. Man goes forth unto his work] His honest employment in his
particular place and calling, when the manual or mental; eating his bread in the
sweat either of his brow, or of his brain.

Until the evening] That time of rest and refreshment. The Lord Burleigh (
William Cecil) when he put off his gown at night, used to say, Ly there Lord
Treasurer, and bidding adieu to all state affairs, disposed himself to his
quiet rest.

Verse. 24. O Lord, how manifold, etc.] q. d. They are so many, and so great,
that I cannot recount or reckon them up, but am even swallowed up of
wonderment: All that I can say, is that they are Magna and mirifica. In man's
body only there are miracles enough, betwixt head and foot, to fill a volume.

The earth is full] It is Gods great purse, Psalm. 24.1.

Verse. 25. So is this great and wide sea] Latum manibus id est si^^bus; yet not
so great and wide as man's heart, wherein is not only that Leviathan some
special foul lusts, but creeping things innumerable, crawling bugs and baggage
vermin.

Wherein are things creeping innumerable,] Far more, and of more kinds than
there are on earth.

Verse. 26. There go the ships] The use whereof was first showed by God in Noah's
Ark, whence afterward Audex Iapeti genus, Japhets offspring sailed, and
replenished the Islands.

There is that Leviathan] Whereof see Job 41. with Notes.

Verse. 27. These wait all upon thee] The great Housekeeper of the world, who
carvest them out their meet measures of meat, and at fit seasons. Of thee they
have it, Per causarum concatenationem.

Verse. 28. That thou give them they gather] Neither have they the least
morsel of meat, but what thou castest them by thy providence. Turcicum imperium
quantum quantum est nibil est nisi panis mica quam dives pater-familias
projicit canibus, says Luther.

Thou openest thy hand] By opening the bosom of the earth thou richly
providest for them. (...).

Verse. 29. Thou hidest thy face] i. e. Thou withdrewest thy favor, thy
concurrence, thine influence, they are troubled, or terrified, a cold sweat
sits upon their limbs, animam agunt, they shortly expire; for in God, we
live, move, and have our being, Act. 17. A frown of Augustus Caesar, Camden.
proved to be the death of Cornelius Gallus, Sir Christopher Hatton Lord
Chancellor of England dyed Sept. 20.1591. of a flux of his urine, and grief of
mind conceived upon some angry words given him by Q. Elizabeth.

Thou take away their breath] Heb. Thou gatherest it, call for it again,
viz. their vital vigor.

Verse. 30 Thou sendest forth thy Spirit] Virtutem vivificam.

They are created] Others of the same kind are; and so the face of the earth is
renewed, whiles another generation springs up. This is matter of praise to
their maker.

Verse. 31. The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever] Or, Let glory be to the
Lord for ever, so. For his great works of Creation and Conservation.

The Lord shall rejoice in his words] As he did at the Creation, when he saw
all to be good and very good; so still, is does God good as it were, to see
the poor creatures feed, and men to give him the honor of all.

Verse. 32. He looks an the earth, and it trembleth] This must be considered,
that God may be as well feared, as loved and praised.

He touches the hills, and they smoak] Its therefore ill falling into his
hands, who can do such terrible things with his looks and touches.

right, to help him to his own, to give him the glory due to his Name, yet I
will do it, and do it constantly, so long as I have a breath to draw.

Verse. 34. My meditation of him shall be sweet] Or, Let it be sweet unto him,
let him kindly accept it (though it be mean and worthless) through Christ's
odours powered thereinto.

I will be glad in the Lord] Withdrawing my heart from other vile and vain
delights, or at least vexed at mine own dullness, for being no more affected
with such inexplicable ravishments.

Verse. 35. Let the sinners be consumed, etc.] Such sinners against their own
souls, as when they know God, or might know him by his, wonderful works,
glorify him not as God, neither are thankful, Rom 1.21. but pollute and abuse
his good creatures to his dishonor, fighting against him with those lives that
he has given them.

Bless the Lord, O my soul] The worse others are, the better be thou, kindling
thy self from their coldness, etc.

PSALM. CV.
Verse. 1. O give thanks unto Lord] Some tell us, that this, and the two
following Psalms, were the great Hallelujah sung as solemn times in their
assemblies. But others say better, that the great Hallelujah (as the Hebrews
called it) began at Psalm. 113. and held on till Psalm. 119. which they at the
Passover began to sing, after that cup of wine they called, Poculum bymni sen
laudationis.

Call upon his Name] Call upon the Lord, when is worthy to be praised, Psalm.
18.3. See the Note there. Our life must be divided betwixt praises and prayers.

1.31. Alsted.

the circumcision which worship in spirit, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have
no confidence in the flesh, Philip. 3.3.

Let the heart of them rejoice, etc. All others are forbidden to rejoice, Hos.
9.1. and bidden to weep and howl, Jam. 5.1.

Verse. 4. Seek the Lord and his strength] That is, his Ark at the remove where
of to Jerusalem this Psalm was sung, 1 Chronicles. 16.7, 8. etc. Called it is Gods

should say, Frequent holy Assemblies, as ever you desire to draw nigh to God,
and to have your faith in him confirmed.

Verse. 5. Remember the mavelous works, etc.] Deeply, and diligently ponder
both the works and words of God, comparing the one with the other, that ye may
the better conceive of both.

Verse. 6. O ye seed of Abraham etc.] Do thus, or else your pedigree will
profit you no more, than it did Dives in the flames, that Abraham called him
Son. An empty title, yields but an empty comfort.

Verse. 7. For he is the Lord] Jehovah, the Essentiator, the promise-keeper,
therefore praise him! He is also in Covenant with us, and will we not do him
this right?

His judgment are in all the earth] His executions upon the Egyptians and
Philistims, are far and near notified and discoursed.

always of his Covenant. God ever remembers, though we many times forget it,

lands, E^^k. 20.6. a type and pledge of heaven to the faithful.

Verse 12. When they were but a few men in member] Seventy souls at their going
down into Egypt, which yet (say the Hebrews truly) were more worth than the
Seventy Nations of the whole world besides. Howb^^t God chose them not for
their worth, or number, but loved them merely because he loved them, Deuteronomy.
7.7,8.

Verse. 13. When they went from one Nation to another] There were seven several
Nations in that Land, wherein they sojourned, flitting from place to place, and

20.1, 2, etc. and 26.1, etc.

Verse. 14. He suffered no man, etc.] So as utterly to oppress them; for
otherwise, they had their ill usages, such as was the taking away of Sarah,
casting out of Isaac, the rape of Dinah, etc. Strangers meet many times with
hard measure.

Yea be reproved Kings] Genesis 12.17. and 20.3. Kings and Queens must not think
themselves to good to nurse Gods little ones, yea to do them homage, licking up
the dust under their feet, Isa. 49.23.

Verse. 15. Touch not mine anointed, etc.] This, God speaks not of Kings, but
to Kings, concerning his people who have an unction from the Father, being
sanctified, and set apart for his peculiar. To touch these, is to touch the
apple of Gods eye, Zach. 2.8. they are sacred persons.

And do my Prophets no harm] The Patriarchs were such, Genesis 20.7. so are still
all godly Ministers, whom they who harm by word or deed, have not so much
knowledge as Pilats wise had in a dream. See Psalm. 14.4.

Verse. 16. Moreover he called for a Famine] How easy is it with God soon to
stawe us all by denying us an harvest or two? If he do but call for a Famine it
is done.

He brake the while staff of bread] Either by withdrawing bread, that staff of
man's life, or his blessing from it; for man lives not by bread alone (or at
all) but by every word, etc. Mat. 4. without which, bread can no more nourish
us than a clod of clay. In pane conclusus est quasi baculus, qui nos sustineat.
See Hag. 1.6. with the Notes.

Verse. 17. He sent a man before them] An eminent and eximious man, Cujus vita
fuit coelum queddam lucidissim is virtutum stellis exornatum, to be their
friend in the Court, and to provide for their livelihood. No danger befalls
the Church, but God beforehand provideth and procures the means of
preservation and deliverance, 2 Pet. 2.9.

Even Joseph whom they had sold] God orders the disorders of the world to his
own glory, and his peoples good.

Verse. 18. Whose feet they hurt with fetters] God hereby fitting him for that
great service; as he did afterward Moses by forty years banishment in Mi^ian,
and David by Saul's persecution, till his soul was even as a weaned child, Psalm.
131.2.

soul; but sin entered not into his conscience. See a like phrase, Luke 2.35.

Fate, Fortune, etc.

The word of the Lord tried him] That he was Affliction-proof, and still
retained his integrity, 1 Pet. 1.7.

Verse. 20. The King sent and loosed him] By his own Master Potiphar, who had
laid him there at his wives in stance; such as are bound ignominiously for
righteousness sake, shall be one way or other loosed honorably.

imprisonment, where of he never dreamt, Joseph has eighty years preferment,
more than ever he dreamt of; God retributions are very bountiful.

Verse. 22. To bind his Princes at his pleasure] To over-aw and to overruled
them, to bind them in prison, if need so required, as himself had been bound,
and that at his pleasure, or according to his own soul, sine consensu Pharaoh,
says Rabbi Solomon, without Pharaohs consent, as he dealt by Potiphar, say
other Rabbis.

And to teach his Senators wisdome] Policy and piety, which yet the Egyptians
long retained not.

Verse. 23. Israel also came into Egypt] Whither he feared to go, till God
promised him his presence and protection, Gen, 46.3, 4. God says the same in
effect to us, when to descend into the grave, Fear not to go down, I will go
down with thee, and be better to thee than thy fears, Jacobs best and happiest
days, were those the spent in Egypt.

Verse. 24. And be increased his people greatly] Against all the power of Egypt
set against them.

And made them stronger than their enemies] They were not so for present, but
the Egyptians conceited and feared they would be so.

forms and fashioneth their opinions of, and affections to others, at his
pleasure, yet without sin.

Tyrant with Hormisaus, and the great Turk with the Christians.

say the Jews as this day.

And Aaron, etc.] God usually sends his by two and two for mutual helps and
comfort.

Verse. 27. They showed his signs] Heb. The words of his signs; for Gods
wondrous works are vocal, they are real sermons of Gods power and justice. See
Exodus 4.8.

Verse. 28. He sent darkness] Palpable darkness by reason of most black and
thick vapors of the earth, mingling themselves with the air; such as Aben-Ezra
said that he once felt sailing upon the Ocean, the gross vapors there putting
out the light of fire and candle, and not suffering them to be re-inkindled.

And they rebelled not against his word] They, that is, the plagues called for,
came immediately, with an Ecce me. Or, They, that is Moses and Aaron refused
not to denounce, and inflict those plagues, though Pharaoh threatened so kill
them; where a man would wonder at Pharaohs hardness and hardiness, that being
in the midst of that deep and dreadful darkness he could rage against God, and
threaten with death his servant Moses. The Arabic (reading. (...) for (...))
renders it, Et irritarunt sermonem ejus; And they (the Egyptians) provoked his
word, or rebelled against it.

Verse. 39. He turned their waters into blood] A just hand of God upon them for
their cruelty in drowning the Hebrew Infants, and a real forewarning, if they
could have seen it, of the death of their firstborn, and their final overthrow
at the red Sea.

dictus.

Verse. 30. The land brought forth frogs in abundance] Like grass that grows
upon the ground, or as fishes spawned in the Sea, as the word signifies; Genesis

quales sunt rubetae and bufones, Ab. Ezra.
but Toads and Lizards; Crocodiles, some think, came out of the River, and
destroyed people.

In the chambers of their Kings] Regis and regulorum inter medias ense^, medias
custodias: This was the finger of God; as it was likewise when a Town in Spain
was overturned by Conies, and another in Thessaly by Moles, a City in France
undone by Frogs, Plin. l. 8. c. 29
and another in Africa by Locusts, etc.

Verse. 31. He spoke, and there came diverse sorts of Flyes] Heb. a mixture, so.
of Waspes Hornets, Dog-flyes (the most troublesome of all other (...)) all
sorts of Insects.

And Lice in all their coasts] This, the Magicians could not do. Quid ciniphe
vilius, etc? says Philo, What Is baser than a Louse? yet hereby God can tame
the sturdiest of his rebels. Some Kings, and other Grandees have dyed of the
lousie disease; as Herod, Philip of Spain, etc.

Verse. 32. He gave them Hail for Rain] Rain was geason in Egypt; but now they
had hail for rain, a giftless gift, Heb. He gave their rain hail, Exodus 9.23.

And flaming fire in their land] That they might see that he was Lord of all
the four Elements.

Verse. 33. He smote their Vines else, and their Figtrees] Of the fruitfulness
of these trees in Egypt, strange things are reported by Solinus and others; but
this extraordinary hail mingled with fire, marred them in the Spring, when they
promised great store of fruit, trusis botris and baccis.

And brake the trees] Yea brained men and beasts that were abroad, as Moses
adds.

Verse. 34. He spoke, and the Locusts came] These are called Gods great army,
and their terrible invasion is graphically described; Joel 3, 4, 5, etc.

blasted, and beaten down.

that plague was reserved to the last, to show Gods long-suffering, and
loathness to destroy men.

Verse. 36. He smote also all the first-born] This he did last of all; the next
spring after the first plague inflicted, and non nisi c^actus, as that Emperor
once said when he subscribed a writ for execution of a certain Malefactor.

The chief of all their strength] Et ubi non erat primogenitus, moritur
epitropus, say the Hebrews, where was not a firstborn, there the steward died;
so that there was no house in Egypt without a dead corpse, as there are few
amongst us, without many dead souls.

Verse. 37. He brought them forth also with silver and gold] Which they had
dearly earned in Egypt, but could not get, till God the right owner of all, set
them in a course, Exodus 12.35, 36. dispencing with his own Law.

There was not one feeble persen, but all able and fit for their journey,
Viatico and firma valetudine instructi.

Verse. 38. Egypt was glad when they departed] For they said, we are all dead
men, Exodus 12.33. The Devil for like cause spoke Christ fair to be rid of him,

For the fear of them fell upon them] God can make the very name and
countenance of his servants fearful to their oppressors.

Verse. 39. He spread a cloud] It must needs be a very large one, that could
cover such an army from the extraordinary heats there; For the Deserts of
Arabia are extreme hot, both by reason of the climate, and also of the sands
reflecting the Sunbeams. So still upon all the glory ( the Church) shall be a
covering, Isa. 4.5.

And fire to give light, etc.] A fiery pillar against the error, terror, and
danger of the darkness. See Neb. 9.19.

Verse. 40. The people asked] Not as suppliants, but as malcontents, and
therefore had what they asked, with a vengeance.

greatest state so served as these miscreants were: and yet we fare better than
they in Gods holy Ordinances.

Verse. 41. He opened the rock] Set it abroach, giving them pluviam ^scatilem;
and petram aquatilem, as Tertul. has it. De patient.


They ran in the dry places] Per deserta Sinis and Tzinis, says Junius. See 1
Cor. 10.4.

Verse. 42. For be remembered his holy promise] Holy, that is, firm, and
inviolable, Heb. The word of his holiness, that is, his sacred and gracious
engagement, whereby he had made himself a voluntary debtor to Abraham's
posterity.

And Abraham his servant] To whom he had passed his promise four hundred and
thirty years before. Nullum tempus occurrit Regi.

Verse. 43. And be brought forth his people with joy] According to his promise
made to Abraham; and according to the time they were afflicted, so were they
comforted, Psalm. ^0.15.

Vineyards, all done to the hand of the Israelites, We shall also enter into our
Masters joy, Mansions made ready for us, etc.

final cause of all the service of God; what should be the result, his praise.

to those that are wise; For high words become not a fool, says Solomon.

PSALM. CVI.
Verse. 1. Praise ye the Lord] Though scattered among the heathen, and in a
sorrowful condition, verse. 47. In prosperity praise the Lord, says Austin, and
it shall increase upon thee. In adversity praise him, and is shall be better
with thee.

O give thanks unto the Lord, etc.] This verse was, say some, the foot or tenor
of the Song in many sacred hymns.

For his mercy indureth for ever] Even to those also that have sinned against
his goodness.

Verse. 2. Who can utter, etc.] i.e. To the just worth of them? None can; they
are fitter to be admired than possible to be uttered. It is enough that we do
what we can toward the work. God accepts according to that a man has, and
not according to that he has not, 2 Cor. 8. he takes it for no small praise,
when we thus acknowledge him to be above all praise.

Who can show forth all his praise?] Surely none can^ David says he will,
Psalm. 9.1. Quis fando expt^mat?
but soon found his utter inability; for according to thy Name, O Lord, so is
thy praise, faith he in another Psalm. The best way is, as here in the ensuing
verses, to submit to Gods justice, and to implore his mercy, and to study
integrity, verse. 3, 4, 5.6.

Verse. 3. Blessed are they that keep judgment, etc.] That are of right
principles and upright practices; this is real and substantial praising of God.
Thank^-doing is the proof of Thanksgiving; and the good life of the thankful
is the life of thankfulness. Those that say, God a thank only, and no more, are
not only contumelious, but injurious.

And be that does righteousness] So preaching forth the virtues (or praises) of
God who has called him into his mavelous light, 1 Pet. 2.9. Jun.
and composing his whole course, velut spectatum aliquod simulach^um and
documentum laudi^ ejus constans atque perpetuum.

Verse. 4. Remember me, O Lord, with the favor, etc.] The Psalmist would have
favor, and special favor, mercies, and sure mercies proper to Go is peculiar,
and with these he would be remembered; grace, he would find such as might help
in time of need, Heb. 4.16. God remembered Noah, Gen 8.3. Your heavenly Father
knows that he have need of these things, Mat. 6. Though our Ark be driven in
a tempestuous sea, yet it shall neither sink, nor split, while we sail in the
thoughts of God.

O visit me with thy salvation] A gracious spirit will not be satisfied with
low things, common mercies.

Verse. 5. That I may see the good of thy chosen] Vt videam in bonum, that I may
see it, and partake of it, have both the vision and fruition of thy great
goodness, which thou have laid up for them that fear thee, Psalm. 31.19. giving
them a taste thereof aforehand, as a few grapes of that promised Canaan.

Of thy Nation] i.e. By this name Gods elect, are here and elsewhere styled,
and therefore the Jews have no reason to reproach us, as they do by it; calling
us Goi, and Ma^zer goi, bastard heathens.

Verse. 6. We have sinned with our Fathers] Adding to their heap, and making up
their measure, Mal. 23.32. People think the example of their Fathers a
sufficient excuse. Jerome once (but not well) desired leave of Austin to err
with seven Fathers whom he found of his opinion. I will follow my forefathers,
says Cicero, although I fall together with them. See Jer. 44.17. But so would
not these good souls, as neither Jeremy chap. 3.25. nor Daniel chap. 9.5. whose
confession suting and symbolizing with this (together with that we read, verse.
47. makes some think that this Psalm was penned for the peoples use then, when
they were captives in Babylon.

We have committed iniquity etc. Sin must be confessed with utmost
aggravation. I Will hear how full in the mouth these are against themselves,
laying on load, whilst their sins swell as so many toads in their eyes.

Verse. 7. Our Fathers understood not] i.e. They weighed them not, improved them
not, but as the dull earth is surrounded by the heavens, yet perceives it not;
so were these with miracles and mercies, yet understood them not.

Even at the red Sea] Not only whiles they were on the bank they feared to
enter, but also even when they were passing and walking over that dry land made
for them by a miracle, they did still continue their murmurings and mu^inings.

Verse. 8. Nevertheless be saved them for his Names sake] Here he comes in with
a Non-obstante. So Isa. 57.17. Now if God will save for his Names sake, wheat
people is there whom he may not save?

That be might make his power to be known] The Lord has other things to look
unto, than presently to punish his people, when they most deserve it.

Verse. 9. He rebuked the red sea also] Ingentia, beneficia, flagitia,
supplicia, as appears in the subsequent verses.

So be led them through the depths] Inter duas aquarum congeries, betwixt two
mountains of waters which stood on each hand of them as a wall, and made a
lane. Every main affliction is our red sea; which while it threatens to
swallow us up, preserves us.

Verse. 10. And be saved them, etc.] From Pharaoh that perfect enemy of theirs,
that pursued them with a deadly design, but was happily prevented.

Verse. 11. And the waters covered their enemies] The preservation of the Church
is ever accompanied with the destruction of its enemies, that the mercy may
appear the greater.

Not one of them was left] Left alive to carry the news.

Verse. 12. Then they believed his words] Then for a flash, whilst the memory of
the mercy was fresh and warm? but ere they were three days elder, they
murmured again; It proved not so much as a nine days wonderment; they were
soon at old ward.

They sang his praise] Exodus 15. A tempory faith and joy.

Verse. 13. They soon forgot his works] Heb. They made baste, they forgot. This
is an aggravating circumstance. See Gal. 1.6. Exodus 32.8. Deuteronomy. 9.16.

They waited not for his counsel] For the performance of what he had purposed
and promised; they were short-spirited and impatient.

Verse. 14. But lusted exceedingly] Heb. Lusted a lust. See Number. 11. they had a
sufficiency, but must have superfluities, as belly-gods; not want, but
wantonness set them a lusting, and that in the wilderness, where they knew that
in an ordinary way it was not to be had.

And templed God] Whom they should have trusted rather, since he waits to be
gracious. and being a God of judgment, knows best when to deal forth his
favors, Isa. 30.18 and 49 8.

Verse. 15. Aug.
And he gave them their request] Deus saepe dat iralus quod negat propitius.
Munera magna quidem misit, sed misit in bamo. Martial.


Quales they had, but to choke them; as afterward, a King, but to vex them,
etc.

But sont leaneness into their soul] i.e. Into their bodies, such a loathing as
caused leanness, Number 11.20. a plague upon their bodies, a curse upon their
souls. Many men eat that on earth, which they digest in hell. It is dangerous
seeding on sins murthering-morsels.

Verse. 16. They envied Moses also] Korah, and his accomplices did; and because
the people punished them not, they are all accused as guilty of that
conspiracy, and looked upon as a rabble of rebels against heaven.

And Aaron the Saint of the Lord] Separated to the Priesthood. The Rabbis tell
us that they had chosen Dathan instead of Moses, and Abiram for Aaron.

Verse. 17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, etc.] Korah is not here
mentioned, happily for his sons sakes, who were famous Prophets and
Musick-masters in David's days. As for On the son of Peleth (one of the chief
conspirators) the Rabbis say that by the good counsel of his wise he repented,
and so escaped.

Verse. 18. And a fire was kindled in their company] It is both a just presage
and desert of ruin, not to be warned. Let seditious persons and Schismatics
take heed; for even our God also is a consuming fire, Heb. 12. ult.

The flame burnt up the wicked] And among the rest Korah, as some conceive,
Dathan and Ab^ram are stigmatized for their stubbornness, Number. 26.9. as was
afterward Abaz, 2 Chronicles. 28.22. and before them all Cain, Genesis 4.15. and
Lamech, 23, 24.

Verse. 19. They made a Calf in Horch] i. e. In the Country near to that
mountain, where they at same time saw visible tokens of Gods dreadful presence.
Well might Aaron say of this people that they were wholly set upon wickedness,
Exodus 3^.22. This piece of Idolatry they had learned belike of the Egyptians,
who worshipped Apis in such a shape; so catching is sin, Lege Lact^nt. and
(...). 1. de muab. Scrip. cap. 15.
and so dangerous is ill company.

Verse. 20. Tous they change their glory] i.e. Their God, Romans 1.23. the Creator
for a contemptible creature.

Of an O^e that eats grass] Tun^ stercora egerit, and multam inquinat^r, as
R. Solomon here glosseth. They pretended not to worship the Calf but God in the
Calf, as did also Jehu, a King. 10.16.29. 2 Chronicles. 11.15. and as the Idolatrous
Papiste do at this day. See Exodus 32.5. yet the text here says, They
worshipped the mo^en Imago, they changed their glory into the si^ilitude of an
Ox. And although some of the Rabbis would excuse this gross Idolatry of their
forefathers, yet others more wise bewail us, and say that there is an ounce of
this golden Calf in all their present sufferings.

Verse. 21. They forget God their Saviour] This is often mentioned as the Mother
of all the mis-rule amongst them.

Verse. 22. Wondrous things in the land of Hon] i.e. Among the Egyptians, Hams
posterity.

And terrible things at the red Sea] All which were buried, together with the
remembrance of God the doer.

Verse. 23. Therefore he said that he would destroy them] Idolatry is a
people-desolating sin. God was once in a mind to have destroyed this people
utterly, and to have left none but Moses, Exodus, 32.10.31, etc. promising him a
great fortune if he would have suffered it; But he tendering Gods glory, more
than his own greatness, refused it: Choice and excellent spirits use to do so.

Had not Moses his chosen] Chosen to represent Christ in his mediatorship.

Stood up in the breach] A metaphor from Military matters. When a strong Hold
is besieged, and a breach made, valiant Soldiers use to make up that breach
with their own bodies, till the enemy be beaten back. Gods wrath was even
breaking in upon the people. Moses prayed instantly and constantly, even the
most part of those forty days and nights he spent in the Mount, Deuteronomy. 9. and
at length prevailed. See Ezekiel. 13.5. and 22.30.

Verse. 24. Yea they despised the pleasant land] Heb. The land of desire,
flowing with milk and honey, sumen totius terre, as One calls it; Egypt they
preferred before it, though it were a gage of heaven, as Cardinal Burbon did
his part in Paris, before his part in Paradise.

They believed not his word] so. That he would, or indeed could give them that
good land. He that believes not, makes God a liar.

Verse. 25. But murmured in their tents] Where they sat discontented (after the
report of the Spies) and as we say, Sick of the Sullens, they would not attempt
a conquest, but bewailed their hard fortune, and let fly on all hands, keeping
a clutter, and a rattle.

Verse. 26. Therefore he lifted up his hand] i.e. He solemnly swore, as Nun.
14.30. or he was fetching his full blow at them.

To overthrow them in the wilderness] Which also befell them according to their
own wicked wish: Let men take heed of wishing evil to themselves, left God say
Amen to it.

Verse. 27. To overthrow their seed also among the Nations] This clause of Gods
oath is not expressed in Numbers, but drawn there-hence as a fearful
consequence, both here by the Psalmist, and also by the Prophet Ezekiel, chap.
20. And R. Solomon's note upon this text is, Tunc erat decretum de desola^^e
Temple, ut lachrymas pro re magna, sicut ante pro nibilo effunderent, Then was
the desolation of the Temple (though it fell out long after) determined, that
those malcontents who cried for nothing before, might have somewhat to cry
for.

Verse. 28. They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor Heb. They were unequally
ye aked, as 2 Cor. 6.14. Quam male in equales veniunt ad ar atra juvenci. Ab
opertione (...) nud^tione pudondorum.


They separated themselves to that shams, Priapus, Hos. 9.10. who had his name
from showing all; and his worshippers were most impudent Varlets.

And ate the sacrifices of the dead] i.e. Of Idols opposed to the living God:
The beginning of Idolatry some say, was the attributing of divine honors to
great persons when they were dead. The heathens showed the sepulchers of their
oldest Deities.

Verse. 29. Thus they provoked him] God cannot brook man's devices in matters of
Religious; he will have no other worship than what himself has appointed.

And the plague brake in upon them] As a Deinge, or as an Army, very
impetuously, to the destroying of; twenty four thousand persons.

Verse. 30. Animose surtexit. Vatab.
Thou (...) By a secret, heroical and extraordinary motion of Gods Spirit, such
as may not be drawn i^ ^ example^ All things reported and commended in (...)
may not (...) imitated^ O^^ Birche^, by example of P^i^^as and (...) thought he
might have killed a great per^o^age in this land whom he looked upon as a
naughty man, and Gods enemy. A patricular example will afford a general
instruction where the equity of the thing done is universal, and the cause
common, otherwise not says learned Junius.

And exe^^^ed judgement] Not tarrying for the sentence of the Judge^. The
Chaldee renders it, And prayed. Execution of justice, is that actual,
magisterial, and majestical king of prayer, that will stay the plague, when
nothing else will.

Verse. 31. And that was counted unto him for righteousness] God not only
condemned him not of r^sh zeal, but looked upon what he had done, as a piece of
singula^ service, and rewarded it accordingly.

Verse. 32. They angered him also at the waters of strife] Yet he made not the
least semblance of it to Moses, but only bad him smite the Rock, which if he
had then done, and no more, he had done right. God is Bagnal Chemah master of
his anger, Nab. 1.2. so was not meek Moses at this time. The best are
miscarried by their passions sometimes to their cost.

So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes] i. e. By their means he was
kept out of Canaan, which was a great cross to him, and his repentance, as to
that favor, came too lare, for God was resolved.

Verse. 33. Because they provoked his spirit] So that he was in a pelt to the
grieving of God^ good Spirit within him, Ephesians. 4.30, 31. O tantaene anim is
coelestibus (...)?

So that be spoke unadvisedly] Some render it only, be spoke, or be pronounced;
he should not have spoken at als to the people (as having no order from God so
to do in that transaction) but only to the Rock. Et perperam locutus est.
Contra charita^, (...) 1 Cor. 13.
Whereas he not only smote the Rock, and smote it twice but spoke to the
people, and spoke rashly, or idly (the Greek word (...) is thought to come
from the Hebrew Bate here used) yea bitterly, calling them Rebels, and falling
foul upon them, with distrustful interrogations, and mis-implications. This is
called Rebellion, Numb. 20.10, 11.24. and severely punished in Gods favorite
Moses.

Verse. 34. They did not destroy the Nations] For which neglect of theirs, pity
would be pleaded. But there is a cruel mercy, says One; There is a pious
cruelty says another Cursed is he that does the Lords work deceitfully, and
cursed is he that restrains his sword from blood, when God bids him
strike. Saul and Ahab felt the dint of this curse, and so did these Israelites,
for sparing the Canaanites, whether out of pusillanimity, or foolish pity.

Verse. 35. But were mingled among the beathen] With whom they made leagues, and
marriages, Jud. 3. and so were soon corrupted by them. It is dangerous to
converse with graceless people, their very example is a compulsion. See Gal.
2.14. how much more their evil counsel?

Verse. 36. And they served their Idols] The Devil is (...) faith Synesius, a
lover of Idolatry, and he speaks through Idolaters as through his truncks,
persuading people to like practice, as did Julian, whom an Ancient therefore
called Idolian

Which were a snare unto them] Or a tuine, as some render it; they were first
drawn in, and then undone by them.

Verse. 37. Yea they sacrificed their sons, etc. The Devils are here called
Shedim Destroyers (in opposition to (...) the Almighty) and worthily; for they
make it their work to waste and spoil people of their dearest children (as
here) of their precious fools, with the blood where of they do daily glut
themselves.

Verse. 38. And shed innocent blood etc.] This was futor (...); but what may not
the Devil do with is drudges, when Gods word cannot obtain the smallest things
of (...)?

Whom they sacrificed unto the Idols of Canaan] Prompted thereunto by that old
manslayer. This was practiced by Maniss^^, (...) and others not a sew, Jer.
7.19. Ezekiel. 16. Haec (...) frequent (...).

And the land was polluted with blood] (...) See Ezra 9.11. As an hypocrite is
a fair (...)

Verse 39. Thus they were (...)] Great sins do greatly pollute; neither are men
by any thing more disadvantaged than by doting upon their own devi^^s.

And went a whoring] They followed it earnestly, and with delight.

Verse. 40. Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kind^ed] Sin does as naturally
draw and suck judgments to it, as the Loadsto^ does iron, or Turpentine fire.

Insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance] This was the greatest of all
miseries, and a piece of hell.

Verse. 41. And he gave them into the hand of the beaten] That they might
suffer by them with whom they had sinned, and with whom, by compliance, they
hoped to have ingratiated.

Verse. 42. And they were brought into subjection] Heb. They were bowed down, or
humbled, who would not humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, that he
might exalt them.

Verse. 43. Many times did be deliver them] And as many times told them, Servati
est is ut mibi servatis, I have therefore saved you that ye might serve me the
better V Sed surdo fabulam, but they would not hearken. (...). Theogn.


Verse. 44. Nevertheless be regarded their affliction] See for proof hereof the
whole book of Judges, and take notice of Gods Philanthropie, who hears men's
afflictions as he did Hegars, Genesis 16.11. and is often found of them that seek
him not, Isa. 65 1. See 2 King. 14.26 27.

When he heard their cry] Heb. Their shril outcry; not for joy (as the word is
mostly tak^^) but for grief.

Verse. 45. And he remembered for them his Covenant] Which could not be vacated
or abolished by the wickedness of men, but stood firm and inviolable, in as
much as God is faithful and merciful.

And repented] That is, changed his severity into clemency. Gods repentance is
not a change of his will, but of his work, Mutatio rei, non Dei.

Verse. 46. And he made them also to be pitied] God can soon turn the hearts of
Tyrants, and make them of Lions, Lambs, etc.

Verse 47. Save us O Lord our God] This is the main request of the Psalm, and
the chief thing intended; for, for this cause prefaced the Prophet, as verse
1.2. etc. and reckoned up the peoples sins, and Gods deliverances, that he
might bring in this, Save us, as thou ever have done.

To give thanks unto thy holy Name] Good ends propounded in prayer is a special
means of speeding. Hypocrites do all in themselves so do not the Saints, Hos.
14.8.) and all for themselves, as Zach. 7.5. Hos. 10.1. which is not the Saints
practice, Cant. 5.1 they have good aims in their good actions.

Verse. 38. Blessed be the Lord] viz. For our return out of captivity, which we
foresee, believe, and give thanks for aforehand.

Praise ye the Lord] Thus they speak one to another, by way of excitation (...)
so Justin Martyr renders it.

PSALM. CVII.
Verse. 1. O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good] He is good, and does
good, Psalm. 119.68. not to his Israel only, as is set forth in the two
foregoing Psalms, but to all mankind, which is Divini ingenii cura, as One
says, whatever Atheists and Epicures say to the contrary, denying a divine
providence, witness that profane Distitch of theirs. Nempe nibil positum est,
and sers incerta vagutar,
Fortque refertque vices, and habent mortalia casunt.


For his mercy endures for ever] Notwithstanding men's many and mighty
provocations.

Verse. 2. Let the Redeemed of the Lord] Four sorts of whom are afterward
inffanced; 1 Exiles; 2 Prisoners; 3 Sick persons; 4 Seamen. These, and the
like must praise him in to special manner for their deliverance.

From the hand of the emmy] Or, of distress.

Verse. 3. And gathered them cut of the lands] He begins with wayfaring men,
and exiles, because according to Tyr^aens, Non exul cure dicitur esse Deo.

And from the South] Heb. From the Sea, that is (as the Chaldee expounds it)
from the Southern Sea, called the Red Sea.

Verse. 4. They wandered in the wilderness, etc.] This is a sad case, Mendicum
pa^ria amissa laribusque vagari. (...).

And yet this is the case of all Gods Redeemed ones whiles they are here, Heb.
11. I Pet. 2.12. Per varies casus per tot discrimina rerum
Tendimus in patriam veram vitamque perennem.


Verse. 5. Hungry and thirsty, etc.] The Lords exiles meet many times with the
like exigents in the wilderness of this wicked world; but let them be content,
and say, We are well for the present, and it will be better with us hereafter.
Exul erat Christus comites nes exulis bujus
Esse decet, cujut nos quoque membra sumus. Meloncthon.



Verse. 6. Then they cried unto the Lord] Though under a wrong name it may be,
as of Jupiter Mercury, etc. and in an uncertain way, as He^^ba did with her, O
Jupiter quicquid es sine coelum boc, sine men's, que vebitur in coele, etc. And
as those Mariners in Jonah 1.5. who cried, Every man to his god, and left they
might all mistake the true God, they awaken Jonah, to call upon his God.

And be delivered them out of their distresses] Out of his general goodness,
and compassion to the poor creature; Like as he hears the young Ravens that
cry unto him, no otherwise than by implication only, and out of meet necessity,
God is the Savior of all men, but especially of these that believe.

Verse. 7. And he led them forth by the right way] Better than that Dee Vibilia
among the Romans, of whom they fancied, that she set them right when out of the
way at any time; or Minerva among the Athenians, who, they said, turned all
their evil counsels to the best unto them.

That they might go to a City of habitation] Grow to a state of settlement, to
Jerusalem, says the Chaldee, to that City which has a foundation may we say,
whose Maker and Founder is God, Heb. 11.10.

Verse. 8. O that men would praise the Lord, etc.] Heb. That they would confess
it to the Lord, both in secret, and in society. This is all the rent that God
requires; he is content that we have the comfort of his blessings, so he may
have the honor of them; This was all the fee Christ looked for, for his cures,
Go and tell what God has done for thee. Words seem to be a poor and slight
recompense; but Christ, says Nazianzen, calls himself the Word.

Verse. 9. For he satisfies the longing soul. etc.] This is a reca^i^ulation of
the first part, verse. 5, 6, 7. and sets forth the reason why the Redeemed
should praise God out of the sweet experience they have had of his wonderful
providence and goodness toward them.

And fills the hungry soul with good things] This flower the blessed Virgin
picketh out of David's garden (among many others out of other parts of holy
Scripture, wherein it appeateth she was singularly well versed) and puts it
into her Posie, Luke 1.53.

Verse. 10. Such as sit in darkness, etc.] Here come in the second fort of Gods
redeemed or rescued Ones, viz. captives and prisoners, whose dark and doleful
condition is in this verse described.

And in the shadow of death] In dark caves and horrid prisons, where there is
Luctus ubique, pavor, and plurima mortis imago. Such was Joseph's first prison,
Jeremies miry dungeon, Lollards Tower, the Bishop of Londons Cole-house, etc.

Being bound in affliction and ir^^] Or, in poverty and iv^n, as Manasseb was.
Many are the miseries that poor prisoners undergo: Good (...) had the
experience of it, and Zegedians, and the Matty^^, and diverse of Gods dear
servants in the late wa^^ h^t^.

A certain-pious Prince discoursing of the dangers that were to b^e then
expected for the profession of Religion, said, Nibisse mag^s metuere qu^m
diururnos carceres, that he feared nothing so much as perpetual imprisonment.

Verse. 11. Because they rebelled against the words of God] Sin is at the
bottom of all men's miseries, as the procreant cause thereof; For God
afflicts not willingly, nor grieveth the children of men, Lam. 3.35. but they
rebel against his words written in the Scriptures, or at least in their hearts;
and so he is concerned in point of honor to subdue them.

And contemned the counsel] A foul fault. See Luke 7.30.

Verse. 12. Therefore he brought down their heart] That proud piece of flesh,
Quod erat elatum and verba Dei contempsit, says Kimchi, which had stouted it
out with God, and thought to have carried it away with a strong hand; as
Manosseh that sturdy Rebel, till God had hampered him, and laid him in cold
irons.

Verse. 13. Then they cried unto the Lord] See verse. 6.

And be saved them, etc.] This is comfort to the greatest finners; if they can
but find a praying heart, God will find a pitying heart, and rebels shall be
received with all sweetness, if at length they return, though brought in by the
cross.

Verse. 14. He brought them out of darkness] He sent his Mandamus, as Psalm.
44.4. and that did the deed, as Act. 5.19. and 12.7.

Verse. 15. Oh that men, etc.] See verse. 8.

Verse. 16. For he has broken the gates of brass] If Sampson could do so, how
much more the Almighty, whom nothing can withstand? Nature may be stopped in
her course, as when the fire burnt not. Men may not be able to do as they
would. Angels good or bad may be hindered, because in them there is an essence
and an executive power, between which God can step at his pleasure, and
interpose his Veto; But who, or what shall hinder the most High?

Verse. 17. Fo^ls because of their transgression] Propter, viam defectionis
suae, by means of their defection, their departing away from the living God,
through an evil heart of unbeleef, Heb. 3.12.

And because of their iniquities] The floodgates whereof are set open as it
were by that their defection from God; For now what should hinder?

Are afflicted] Heb. Do afflict themselves, procure their own ruthe, if not
ruin, and so prove sinners against their own souls, as those Number 16.

Verse. 18. Their soul abborreth] That is, their^st match loatheth it as
unsavory, though it be never so dainty; An appetite to our meat is an
unconceivable mercy, and as we say, A sign of health.

And they draw near to the gates of death] Jam ipsum mortis limen pulsant; as
till then, little sense of sin or fear of the wrath to come. See Job 33.19, 20,
21, 22, 23. with the Notes.

Verse. 19. Then they cry, etc.] Quando medicus and medicine non prosunt, says
Kimchi, when Physicians have done their utmost. See verse. 6.

Verse. 20. He sent his word and bealed them] He commanded deliverance, and it
was done; unless there be an allusion to the essential Word, who was afterward
to take flesh, and to heal the diseased.

And delivered them from their destructions] Heb. From their corrupting-pits or
graves, which do now even gape for them. And he calls them theirs, quia per
peccatum faderunt eas. says Kimchi, because by their sin themselves have
dug them.

Verse 21. Oh that men, etc.] See verse. 8.

And for his wonderful works] Men are misericordiis and miraculis obsesse, and
it were no hard matter to find a miracle in most of our mercies.

Verse. 22. And let them sacrifice, etc.] If they have escaped sickness, let
them offer a Passover; and if they have recovered, a Thank-offering. Heathens
in this case praised their Esculapius; Papists their Sebastian, Valentine,
Apollonia, etc. Ear^ of wax they offer to the Saint, who as they suppose cures
the ears; eyes of wax to the Saint that cures the eyes, etc. But it is Jehovah
only who heals us.

And declare his Works, etc.] Memorize, and magnify them.

Verse. 23. They that go down is the Sea in ships] Here we have a fourth
specimen or instance of Gods gracious and wise dispensations toward men, in
their trading or traffiquing by Sea. These are said to go down to Sea, because
the banks are above it; but the water is naturally higher then the land, and
therefore Sailors observe, that their ships fly faster to the shore than from
it. But what a bold man, says the Poet, was he that first put forth to Sea?
Illi robur, and et triplex
Circa pectus erat, qui fragilem truci
Commisit pelage ralem
Primus, Hec timuit praetipitem Africum, etc. Harat. Od lib. ^.3.



That do business in great waters] Merchants and Matriners, who fish, and find
Almug, or Coral, says Kimcht, who do export and import commodities of all
sorts.

Verse. 24. These see the works of the Lord etc.] In Sea Monsters, as Whales and
Whirlepools, and sudden change of weather, and the like, not a few; Ebbs and
Flows, Pearls, Islands, etc. These are just wonders, and may fully convince the
veriest Atheist that is.

Verse. 25. For he commands and raises the stormy wind, etc.] Of this Seneca,
though an heathen could say, Inter caetera providentiae uivina opera boc quoque
dignum est admiratione, etc. Among other works of the Divine providence, this
is admirable, that the winds lie upon the Sea for the furtherance of
Navigation, etc.

Verse 26. They mount up to heaven, they go down etc.] An elegant hypolyposis or
description of a storm at Sea; like whereunto is that in Virgil. Tollimur in
coelum curvate gurgite, and iidem
Subducta admanes imos descendimus unda. Tollimur in c^^^um, nanc (...).
tadimus undas.



Their soul is melted because of trouble] They are ready to dye, through sear
of death. Junius understands it of extreme vomiting, as if they were casting
up their very n^^^ts. Anocbarses for this cause doubted whether he should
reckon Mariners amongst the living or the dead. And another said, that any man
will go to Sea at first I wonder not; but to go a second time thither, is
little better than madness.

Verse. 27. They reel to and fro, etc.] Nutart nautae, and vacillant cerebro and
pedibus.

And are at their wits end] All their skill and strength fails them at once;
they can do no more for their lives. Heb. All their wisdom is swallowed up;
that is, the art of Navigation is now to no use with them.

Verse. 28. Then they cry unto the Lord] Then, if ever: Hence that speech of
One, Qui nescit ora^e, discat navigate, He that cannot pray, let him go to Sea,
and there he will learn. See verse. 6.

Verse. 29. He makes the storm a calm] He, that is God Almighty, whose the Sea
it, and he made it, Psalm. 100. not the Pagans, Neptune, or the Papagans, St.
Nicholas.

So that the waves thereof are still] If therefore the voluptuous humors in our
body (which is but as a cup made of the husk of an Acorn in respect of the Sea)
will not be pacified, when the Lord says unto us, Be still; every drop of
water in the Sea, will be a witness of our monstrous rebellion and disobedience.

Verse. 30. Then are they glad because they be quiet] All is hushed on the
sudden, as Mat. 8.26. both their fears, and the Seas outrages being quickly
reduced to a peaceable period.

So he brings them to their desired haven] This is more than they then wished
for, God is many ties better to men than their prayers.

Verse. 31. Oh that men would, etc.] See verse. 8.

Verse. 32. Let them exalt him also in the Congregation, etc.] i.e. In all
public meetings Ecclesiastical and Civil.

Verse. 33. He turns vivers into a wilderness] Hitherto the Psalmist has set
forth Gods good providence in delivering men from diverse deaths and dangers;
now he declares the same in his just and powerful transmutations in nature,
whilst according to the good pleasure of his will, he changes men's condition,
either from good to evil, or from evil to good, beyond all expectation; It is
even He that does it, whatsoever a company of dizzy-headed men dream to the
contrary, as One phraseth it. It is God who dries up those Rivers, whereby the
land was made fat and fertile, Isa. 41.17.

Verse. 34. fruitful land into barrenness] Heb. Sal^^ess. See Luke 14.34, 35.
Deuteronomy. 29.23. Jud. 9.45. Sals beendeth barrenness, by eating up the lat and
moisture of the earth. Some think the Psalmist here alludeth to Sod^me and her
sisters turned into the dead Sea.

For the wickedness of them that dwell therein] Hereof Judea is at this day a
noble instance (besides many parts of Asia, and Africa, once very fruitful,
now, since they became Mabemetan, dry and desert) Judea, says One, has now
only some few parcels of rich ground found in it; that men may guess the
goodness of the cloth by the fineness of the shreds. Greece which was once Sol
and sal gentium, says Another, terrarum flos, fons lite rarum, nunc vel Priams
miserands manus -- nunc in Graecia desideremus Graeciam; it is nothing like the
place it was once.

Verse. 35. He turns the wilderness, etc.] Some place a again, God (to show
his power and providence) of steril makes to become fertile; Pol^^ia for
instance, and other Northern Countries. Germany and France were of old full of
Woods and Lakes, as Caesar and Tacitus testify, now it is otherwise. So in
America at this day. So diverse desert places of Egypt and Ethiopia, when once
they became Christian, became fruitful.

Verse. 36. And there he makes the hungry to dwell] As our English, and other
Plantations in America, where sundry poor people get fair estates.

That they may prepare a City] The building of Cities is of God, and so is
their conservation.

Verse. 37. And sow the fields, and plant vineyards] These are noble
employments, such is the ancient Patriarchs we re much in, and the most
honorable among the Romons, as Coriolanus, M. Curious, Cate Major, etc. Our
forefathers, if they could call any one, Bonum colonum, a good husbandman, they
thought it praise enough says Cicero.

Which may yield] The thankful earth yielding by Gods blessing, her gratum
onus, full burden to the laborious tiller.

Verse. 38. He blesses them also, etc.] See Prove. 10.12. Psalm. 127.1. Jam. 4
15. They are out, that rest in natural causes.

Verse. 39. Again they are minished] Minorati sunt; This also is of the lord,
who has treasuries of plagues, and cannot be exhausted.

Verse. 40. He pours contempt, etc.] See Job. 12.21, 24. with the Notes. Poena
tyrannoram est contemptus, exilium, nex, says Genebrard. All their policy or
King craft cannot save them.

Verse. 41. Yet sets be abe poor] The godly poor, as he did David.

And makes him families like a flock] of sheep, which multiply exceedingly in
a short space.

Verse. 42. The righteous shall see it, and rejoyce] It shall cheer them up to
see that the reigns of Government are in Gods hand; and to behold such love in
such providence.

And all iniquiry shall stop her mouth] Shall be down in the mouth, as we use
to fay. See Job 5.16. and have her tongue chambered.

Verse. 43. Whose is wise] Heb. who is wise? q d. not many. Rari quippe boni.
Exclamatio querulatori^ Piscat.
None but those that observe providence, and lay up experiences; which if men
would do, they might have a Divinity of their own, were they but well read in
the story of their own lives.

Even they shall understand, etc.] And as for those providence that for
present he understands not, rejicit in Dei abyss^s; he believes there is a
reason for them, and that they shall one day be unridled.

PSALM. CVIII.
Verse. 1. O God, my heart is fixed] For the five first verses of this Psalm,
see the Notes on Psalm. 57.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. And for the eight last, see the
Notes on Psalm. 60. verse. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

PSALM. CIX.
A Psalm of David] Written by him, usque ad^^ terribili and b^rrifica eratiom,
says Be^^^, in such terrible terms, as the like in not tobe found in holy
Scripture; wherefore it is to be read and used with very great judgment, and
not as those misc^^ants of whom Faber writes, Quod more magic^ clam (...) bunc
Psalmam per (...) exectation is in torum bestes, that after a conjuring fashion
they muttered out this Psalm, by way of curse upon their enemies.

Verse. 1. Hold not thy peace] But plead my cause, clear mine innocence.

O God of my praise] The object of my praises, or thou that keep up my
credit, as a witness, judge, and avenger of mine integrity.

Verse. 2. For the mouth of the wicked] There is nothing more easy, than to wag
a wicked tongue.

They have spoken against me with a lying tongue] But with so much impudence,
as if it were a very truth. Socrates in his Apology, My Lords, said he to the
Judges, I know not how you have been affected with mine accusers eloquence,
while you heard them speak: For mine own part, I assure you, that I, whom it
touches most, was almost drawn to believe that all they said, though against
my self, was true, when they sca^oe uttered one word of truth.

Verse 3. They compassed me about also, etc.] So that I could not find out any
way to clear my self, though never so innocent.

And fought against me] So they smote Jeremy with the tongue, and our Savior
suffered the contradiction of sinners, Heb. 12.

Verse. 4. For my lave they are mine adversaries] Heb. They Satanico By hate me.
To render evil for evil is brutish, but to render evil for good, is devilish.

But I give my self to prayer] Heb. But I am prayer, or, a man of prayer, as
Psalm. 120.7. But I am peace. So, being defamed we pray, I Cor. 4.12. When out
Savior was wearied out with the Peoples obstinacy, he turns him to God by
prayer, Mat. 11.26. and prayed for his Crucifiers, Mat. 27. Send me to my Toads
again (in the Dungeon) where I may pray for your Lordships conversion, said
Saunders the Martyr to Winchester.

Verse 5. And they have rewarded me] See verse. 4. Flectere naturam gratia nulla
potest.

Verse. 6. Set thou a wicked man ever him] Whose tender mercies may be
cruelties: let the Devil be his Task-master. Thus he prays against Doeg, or
Ahitophel, but certainly Judas, Act. 1.20. And so the primitive Christians
prayed against Julian the Apostate, and afterward against Arius the heretic,
whose death was precationis opus non morbi, Lib. 1. cap. 15.
the effect of prayer, rather than of his disease, says Socrates. We are bound
to pray daily, Thy Kingdom come, but must be advised how we pray, as David
here does, against particular persons: His curses here and elsewhere are
indefinite, or conditional; either he names not the man, or intends it, if
God intend it so, or they are non tam vota quam vaticinia, not so much prayers
as prophecies.

And let Satan (or an Adversary) stand at his right hand] To withstand him, and
get the better of him, as Zach. 3.1. Or, to aggravate his fault before an
unjust Judge.

Verse. 7. When he shall be judged] Let him him be cast in all his Suits, causa
excidat.

And let his prayer become sin] Quet opud judicem pre^es adhibebit tot fibi
mulctas accersat: If he beg favor of the Judge, let it be the worse for him,
as it befell Haman, Est. 7.7, 8.

Verse. 8. Let his days be few] Let his execution be hastened, as Hamans was.
Ahitophel, and Judas were their own deaths-men. Doeg doubtless come to an ill
end; and so did other persecutors. See the book of Martyrs.

And let another take his office] Praefecturam. Officers are oft-times the
Churches chiefest enemies; Popish Bishops, especially, as here in Q. Mary's
days. Judas was guide to those that took Jesus, Act. 1.16.20.

Verse. 9. Let his children be fatherless] Helpless and shiftless. A sore
vexation to many on their deathbeds, and just enough upon graetlesi
persecutors. But happy are they who when they lie a dying, can say as Luther
did, Domine Dous gratias age tibi quod v^lueris me esse pauperem, and mendicum,
etc. Lord God, I thank thee for my present poverty, but suture hopes. I have
not an house, lands, possessions, moneys, to leave behind me. Thou have given
me wise and children, behold I return them back to thee, and beseech th^e to
nourish them, keep them safe, as hither^o thou has^ done me, O thou Father of
the (...) judge of (...).

Verse. 10. Let his children be (...)] Let them w^ndring w^nder, ^^ Genesis 4.12.
Cains curse. Let them rogue about, -- and timeda voce ragare cibet. This is
many times a token of Gods wrath.

Out of their desolate places] Or, for that their places are desolate, and will
afford them no succor.

Verse. 11. Let the extortioner catch all that he hath] As it were in nets and
snares, that is in bonds, debts, morgages; So Chrysostom expounds, Psalm.
10.9. Et ipsum and omars ejus facultates inexplicabilibus sasis laqueis immitas
foeneratores irretiant, let the merciless usurer make a prey of him and his
estate.

And let the stranger, etc.] Who has no right to it, and will show as little
mercy. The Chaldee here has it, Colligat fiscus omnia quae ipsius sunt. And
Quae non capit Christus, rapit fisous, says Bernard.

Verse. 12. Let there be none to extend mercy to him] Let God in his justice set
off all hearts from him, that had been so unreasonably merciless. Thus no man
opened his mouth to intercede for Haman; Judas was shaken off by the Priests,
and bid see to himself, etc.

Neither let there be any to favor his fatherless] Pupillis pusillis. Let
there be none to plead their Pupils cause against the griping extortioner, or
the stranger that violently invadeth their right.

Verse. 13. Let his posterity be cut off] Sit ejus exitus excidium, so some
render it, Let his end be destruction, but it is better to take it, as we
translate, Let his posterity, etc. Let them be razed and rooted out of
remembrance, they and their whole race.

Let their name be blotted out] That they may not live, so much as by same. The
Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, have no memorial but what they have in the
Bible, and that is for no good. And the like may be said of Meroz, Judge. 5.23.
which seems to have been some City near the place where the battle was
fought; but what it was none can determine, since there is no mention elsewhere
to be found of it, which seems to be an effect of that bitter curse
pronounced against it. See Prove. 10.7.

Verse. 14: Let the iniquity of his fathers, etc.] In whose sinful steps he
treads, be charged upon him.

And let not the sin of his mother] Who bred him no better, but cockered him in
wicked courses, and gave him no good example, Partus fer e sequitur ventrem.

Verse. 15. Let them be before the Lord] Stand ever upon record in his presence,
to provoke him to wrath. A heavy curse indeed.

Verse. 16. Because that he remembered not to show mercy] Here the Prophet
begins to show why he uses such doleful imprecations against his enemies,
viz. not out of a spirit of revenge, or a false zeal, but as truly seeking Gods
glory, and his Churches safety, which could not other wise be procured, unless
these merciless men were devoted to destruction. He remembered not, that is, de
industria oblitus est and omisit, he forgot and neglected it for the nonce.

Verse. 17. At he loved cursing, etc.] The back-slider in heart shall he filled
with his own Ways, Prove. 14.14. Cursing men are cursed men, as were easy to
instance in sundry, as Hacket hanged in Q. Elizabeth's Reign, and Sir Jervase
Ellowaies Lieutenant of the Tower in K. James his days, according to their own
wishes. See Mr. Clarks Mirror, p. 210 etc. The Jews are still great cursers of
Christians, they shut up their daily prayers with Maledic Domine Nazaraek, and
how it comes home to them who knows not, even wrath to the utmost, I These.
2.16?

Verse. 18. As he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment] Ut vestis
commens^rata corpori, as the inner garment that sticks closest to the body, and
is not done off, but with much ado, as he has wrapped, and trussed up himself
in cursing.

So let in come into his bowels like water] Let him have his belly full of it,
and his bones full too.

And like ey!] Which easily soaketh through. See Nam. 5.22.

Verse. 19. Let it be unto him as a garment] Not as an inner, but outer garment
also, Actio and merces.
that men may see and say, This it an accursed person; the visible vengeance of
God pursues him.

Verse. 20. Let this be the reward] Opus vel Oper a precium. The same Hebrew
word signifies Work and Wages, Job 7.2. Isa. 49.4. persecutors shall be sure
of their payment.

Verse. 21. But do thou for me] Fas mecum, sis mibi a latere, stick to me, act
on my behalf, and for my behoof.

Verse. 22. For I am poor and needy] As a Lazar shows his ulcers to move pity;
so does David his indigency, and aylements.

And my heart is wounden] I have mine inward troubles also; or I am cordicisus
vulneratus, almost dead, animam age.

Verse. 23. I am gone like the shadow] Abii, perii, evenui, I vanish as the long
shadows do, so soon as the Sun sets.

As the Locust] Leapeth from hedge to hedge, so do I from place to place, being
tossed from post to pillar, (...) I Cor. 4.

Verse. 24. My knees are weak through fasting] Either for lack of meat, or
stomach to it; genua la^am, my knees buckle under me, the strong men bow
themselves, Eccles. 12.3.

My flesh fails of fatness] I am lean and low brought. Christ might well cry
out, My ^^a^^ess, my leanness; so busy he was for his Father, and so worn out,
that they judged him well nigh fifty, when he was not much above thirty, Job.
8.57.

Verse. 25. I become also a reproach] In respect of my leanness.

They shaked their beads] This is threatened as a curse, Deuteronomy. 28. but may
befall the best, as it did our Savior, Psalm. 22. Mat. 27.

Verse. 26. Help me, O Lord] Prayer, like those arrows of deliverance, must be
multiplied, as out trouble is lengthned and lies on.

Verse. 27. That they may know] That I am delivered merely by thy presence and
power. It is the ingenuity of the Saints, in all their desired, or expected
mercies to study Gods ends more than their own.

Verse. 28. Let them curse, but bless thou] Yea the rather, as a Sam. 16.12. and
I wot well that those whom thou blessest shall be blessed, as Isaac once said
of his son Jacob, Genesis 27.33.

When they arise] To plead their own cause, cousa extidant.

Verse. 29. As with a mantle] Sicut diploide, says the Vulgar, as with a
doublet, q.d. Let them be double ashamed; for which purpose also he here
doubleth his prayer.

Verse. 30. I will greatly praise the Lord] Diligenter and impense, Gods
blessings are binders; and great deliverances call for suitable praises, the
neglect hereof is crimen stellionatus, cousenage.

Verse. 31. For he shall stand at the right hand] As a saithful and powerful
((...) sive (...)) Champion, and not as Satan stands at the persecutors right
hand, verse. 6.

From those that condemn him] Heb. From the judges of his soul, sc. Saul, and
his Courtiers, who judged him worthy of death.

PSALM. CX.
A Psalm of David] Concerning Christ, says R. Obadiah, and so say Christ
himself, Mat. 22. (...) Chrysostom.
and his Apostles, I Cor. 15. Heb. 7. and 10. though some Rabbines maliciously
say otherwise, as R. Joseph, ca^us qui bic cae^li^, to say the best of him, and
other Jew Doctors, who stagger here in their expositions, as drunkards.

Verse. 1. The Lord said unto my Lord] In this one verse we have a description
of Christ's person, his ware and his victory; so that we may say of it (and so
indeed of the whole Psalm, which is an Epitome of the Gospel) as Tully did of
Bru^as his Laconical Epistle, Quam multa, quam pancis! How much in a little.
See the Note on Mat. 22.44.

Sit thou at my right hand] Sit thou with me in my Thron^, having power over
all things in heaven and earth, Matthew. 28. Christ, as man, received, what, as
God, he had before.

Until I make thine enemies thy footseel] Foes Christ has ever had, and shall
have to the worlds end; but then they shall be all in a place fittest for them,
viz. under Christ's feet; even those who now se^ up their Crests, face the
heavens, and say unto the King, Apos^^^t^, (...) it (...) with him.

Verse. 2. The Lord shall send the Ro^of thy strength] That is, the Gospel, that
Scepter of Christ's Kingdom, that power of God to salvation, unto as many as
believe, mighty through God to work (...), 2 Cor. 10.5. Act. 20.31. even the
preaching of Christ's cross.

Out of Sin] For salvation in of the (...) Job. 4. (...) lem till, etc. Act. 1.

Rule thou it the midst of thin^ enemies] Among Jews, Pagans, Turks, Papaga^s,
those that will not bend, let them break; those that will not stoop to thy
Government, let them feel thy power, Psalm. 45.5.

Verse. 3. Thy people shall be willing] All Christ's subjects are Volunteers,
free-hearted, In Psalm. 1.
like those Isles that wait for Gods Law, Isa. 42.8. Zech. 8.11. They love to
be his servants, Isa. 56.6. Lex voluntaries quaerit, says Ambrose.

In the day of thy power] Copiarum tuarum of thine Army, or of thy Militia,
when thou shall lead on thy Church Militant, and be in the head of them,
conquering and to conquer, Rev. 6.2. Some understand it of the Christian
Sabbath day.

In the beauties of holiness] i.e. In Church assemblies, in the beauty of holy
Ordinances, at the administration whereof, Christ's Birth-dew, that is, the
influence of his Spitis and his presence in those Ordinances is from the womb
of the morning, i.e. is of that generating and enlivening virtue, that the dew
of the teeming morning is to the seeds and plants of the earth. An apt
similitude both to express the multitude of Christ^ converts, and the manner of
their heavenly generation. See Mac. 5.7. with the Note.

Verse. 4. The Lord has sworn, etc.] Christ's Priestly Office, as well as his
Kingly, is here described, whereof how many, and how great mysteries there are,
see Heb. 7. with the Notes. The Church is collected and conserved not only by
Christ's Kingly power, but also by his Priestly mediation.

Thou art a Priest] 1. To expiate. 2. To intercede.

After the order of Melchisedeck] Who whether he were Shem, or some other, is
not easy to determine. Melchisedeck was a King, and a Priest. Christ was more,
a Priest, a Prophet, and a King. These Offices have met double in some others;
as Melchisedech, was King and Priest, Samuel a Priest, and a Prophet; David a
King, and a Prophet; but never met all three in any, but in Christ alone.

Verse. 5. The Lord at thy right hand] Before, Christ was at the Fathers right
hand; here the Father at his; this is to show the equality of the Father, and
the Son, falsh Hierom. Athanasius, by Lord here, understands the Holy Ghost.
Others by thy right hand, will have the Church to be meant, who is promised
protection and victory. The Lord Christ shall slay her enemies in battle verse.
5. compel them to fly and turn their backs, verse. 6. pursue them flying, verse.
7. as Judge. 7.5. etc.

Verse. 6. He shall judge among the heathen] Do execution upon his enemies, as
verse. 1. whether Kings or Caitives.

He shall fill the places] The ditches of their own camps.

He shall wound the heads] Heb. Head; cruontabit caput, whereby some understand
the Roman Empire, with its Image, Antichrist with his adherents, who are called
Heathens, Rev. 11.2. Others, Turks and Saracens, reading the next words, Over
the land of Rabbab, the chief City of the Ammonites, who were likewise
Arabians; and so they make it an allusion to David's victories over the
Ammonites, 2 Samuel 10. and 12.

Verse. 7. He shall drink of the brook in the way] i. e. Of the wrath of the
Almighty, Viver paup^rem vitem (...) Chrys^st. Ae^umnas omnes dutis^ mae
militiae perferet. Be^
pointing to Christ's state of humiliation, as in the next words to his
exaltation; Or, he shall content himself with a low condition here; such as was
that of Eli^^ when he drank of the brook, I King. 17. Or, in the eager pursuit
of his enemies, he shall drink hastily of the water next at hand, i.e. as
Gideon, and his Soldiers did.

Therefore shall be lift up the hand] Maugre the heads of his enemies, he shall
rise again, reign, and triumph, and so shall all his members, after that
through many ^^ibulations they have entered into the Kingdom of heaven. Christ's
and their (...) but a drinking of the brook, not a spring of water for
perpetuity; they are (...) a dark entry into out Fathers house, a dirty lane to
a stately Palace, shut but your eyes, as that Martyr at the stake said, and
there will be a change immediately. Look how the Disciples, after they had
taken Christ into the ship, were presently at shore, after a Tempest: So the
Saints have no sooner taken death into their besomes, but they are landed
presently at the (...) of (...), at the Kingdom of heaven.

PSALM. CXI.
Verse. 1. (...) ye the Lord] At the (...) especially; for this and the other
Hallelujatical Psalms that follow (called by the Jews the Great Hallelujah)
were sung as that and other solemn (...), in praise of God for his manifold
mercies.

I will praise the Lord] Musica huju^ Psalmi insignis est, siquis com consequi
potuit. The great are used in the composure of this, and some other Psalms
(after the order of the Hebrew Alphabet) serves both to set forth their
excellency, and for the help of memory.

Verse. 2. The works the Lord aye great] Magnalia; no small things are done by
so great a hand. Grandior solet esse Deus in parvulis quam in magnis; in formic
is major anima quam in Elephantis in nanis quam in gigantibus.

Sought out of all them] q.d. Great though they be, yet are they seriously
sought into, and found out by those that delight therein; and the deeper they
dive into them, the sweeter they find them. Basil diligently described many
creatures; and so did Ambrose after him. Pliny (who was himself a very great
searcher in Natures secrets) tells of one who spent eight and fifty years in
learning out the nature of the Be, Et non duns assecutus sit omnies, and yet
could not attain to all. Our Anatomists find still new wonders in the body of a
man, etc. God has showed singular skill in his works, that men might admire
him; But woe to such as regard not his handiwork, Isa. 5.12.

Verse. 3. His work is honourable] Heb. Honor and glory, they all come tipped and
gilt, with a glory upon them, a centro ad coelum. This the brutish man knows
not, Psalm. 92.6.

His righteousness endures for ever] His judgments are sometimes secret, but
always just.

Verse. 4. He has made his wonderful, etc.] Memorabilia reddedit mirabilia sua
clemens and misericors Jehova.

Verse. 5. He bath given meat] Heb. a prey, Escam demensam; as he did Manna to
the Israelites to each an Homer; so to all his he gives food convenient for
them, Prove. 30.8. Cibum and petum quae sunt divitiae Christianorum. Hieron.


He will ever be mindful of his Covenant] To pass by his peoples sins, and to
supply all their necessities: All his paths to such are not mercy only, but
truth, Psalm. 25.

Verse. 6. He has showed his people, etc.] To them it is given to see, but not
to others who are delivered up to a judiciary blindness. Call unto me and I
will answer the^, and show thee great and hidden things which thou know not,
Jer. 33.3.

That he may give them etc.] Yea power over all Nation^, Rev. 2.

Verse. 7. The works of his hands] They speak him a true and just God.
Chrysostom takes truth here for mercy, and notes that God usually mixeth
mercy with justice; yet sometimes he sends an evil, an only evil, Ez. k. 7.

All his commandements] That is, his promises added to his commandments; or
they are so called, because firm and sure, as the commandments of an Emperor.

Verse. 8. They stand fast for ever and ever] The promises are infallible, good
sure hold, not yea and nay, but Yea and Amen.

And are done] i.e. Ordained, made, and ratified.

Verse. 9. He sent redemption to his people] Once out of Egypt, ever out of
Satan's thraldom.

He has commanded his Covenant for ever] Sic cum popule suo pactus est ut de
ipsius pacti observatione certis edict is caverit, as he covenanted, so he
looks his commandments should be respected, which are as binding to us, as
his Covenant is to him; and through grace, his Covenant is as binding to him as
those are to us.

Holy and reverend is his Name] Which therefore we should not presume in a
sudden unmanne^liness to blurt out. The Jews would not pronounce it. The
Grecians (as Suidas observes) when they would swear by their Jupiter, forbear
to mention him This is check to the profaneness common amongst us. Let those
that would have their name reverend, labor to be holy as God is holy.

Verse. 10. The fear of the Lord is be beginning of wisdome] Or the principal
point and chief perfection. See Prove. 1.7. and Job 28.28. with the Notes.

A good understanding have all they] So much a man knows in true account, as
he does; Hence understanding is here ascribed to the will; so Job 28.28. See
Eccles. 10.2 some render it, Good success.

His praise endures for ever] i.e. Gods praise; for they that understand it of
the godly wise man, understand not the propriety of the Hebrew word Tebilla^,
says an Interpreter.

PSALM. CXII.
PRaise ye the Lord] See Psalm. 111. verse. 1. Blessed is the man that fears
the Lord] That obedientially seareth him as aforesaid, Psalm. 111.10. that
fears the Lord, as Abraham did, Genesis 22.12. Midrash Till^^ in Psalm. 112.
who is the blessed man here described, say the Jew-Doctors, because he kept
the whole Law from (...) to Tau (this Psalm also is Alphabetical as the former)
wish his whole heart, delighting in Gods commandments, and hastening to fulfill
them; as when he left his Country, circumcised his family, sacrificed his son.

That delights greatly in his commandements] And thereby shows that his
fear of God is filial and amicable, not base and servile, which ever carries
tor^^ent along with it; and he that so seareth, is not made perfect in love, I
Job. 4.18. cannot but hate him whom he so fears; for Quam metuunt oderunt.

Verse. 2. His seed shall be mighty upon earth] As Abraham's was, and besides,
the reward of his humility and fear of the Lord was riches and honor, and
life, Prove. 22.4. For godliness is profitable to all things, having the
promises of this life, and of that to come, I Tim. 4.8. as in this Psalm is
fully set forth.

The generation of the righteous, etc.] Personal goodness is profitable to
posterity, and the contrary.

Verse. 3. Wealth and riches] Wealth enough, as the word Hon signifies a
well-contented sufficiency. His chambers shall be filled with all precious and
pleasant riches, Prove. 24.4.

His righteousness endures for ever] He is not the worse for his wealth, nor
drawn aside by the deceitfulness of riches; which yet is hard and happy. Ardua
res baec est opibus non tradere mores:
Et cum tot Craesos viceris, esse Numam. Martial.



Verse. 4. Unto the upright, there arises light in darkness] i.e. Joy in
tribulation, as did unto the Martyrs, plenty in penury, at having nothing, and
yet possessing all things, 2. Cor, 6 10. If they have not an external
affluence, yet they have an internal influence of grace and comfort, which is
far better and sweeter, I Tim. 6.6. Some render the words thus, He who is
gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous (i.e. God) causes light to
arise in darkness upon the upright; who also, is, according to his measure, and
by participation from God, gracious, merciful, and righteous.

Verse. 5. A good man shows favor and lendeth] A publick-spirited man, Romans
5.7. makes his moderation to be known to all men, Philip. 4.5. and lends,
looking for nothing again, Luke 6.35. Thence it is that to him light arises in
darkness; the merciful shall have mercy, Mat. 5.7. Some render it, Been vire
qui miseratur, Well is the man, or, Well will it be with the man that pittieth
and lends. The Hebrew has it, That is pitying and lending, ever in such
actions.

He will guide his affairs with discretion] Heb. With judgment; neither
illiberal not prodigal, not withered handed when he should give, nor yet
stretching beyond the staple; for that were to spoil all. Tremellius renders
it, Moderatur res suas, ex officio.

Verse. 6. Surely be shall not be moved for ever] Non nutabit. The world
thinks liberality to be the ready way to beggary: But it is otherwise, Isa.
32.8. The liberal man devises liberal things, and by liberal things he shall
stand. Not getting, but giving is the way to wealth.

The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance] Namely with the righteous.
Demetrius has good report of all good men, and of the truth it self, 3 Job.
12. Vatab.
As for wicked men. Calumnias little nunqu^m effugit, there is no escaping their
cavils and calumnies.

Verse. 7. He shall not be afraid of evil tydings] When the miserly miscreant is
ready to make away himself for feat of what evil may follow, this man is
undaunted and unappaled. The fear of God so ballasteth his hears, that he
floteth steadily; and blow what wind it will, he saileth sat to the port.
Fides famem non formidat, Faith seareth no famine, nor any thing else; when as
a sound of sear is ever in the wicked man's cars, Job. 15.

His heart is fixed] viz. Upon the promises of God, and hence he (...) a
spiritual security, a blessed Sabbath of Spirit; he is freed, if not from the
common destruction, yet from the common distraction; for he knows whom he
has trusted. Praeclara est equabilitas in omni vita, In offic.
and idem semper vnitus, eademque frons, says Cicero, It is a brave thing to
have a well-composed spirit in all changes, and to look alike however the world
goes. (...) lib. 9.
The heathens tell us that C. Lalius was such an one, and Archimedes, and
Socrates, who are said to have been far above all fear of, or grief at, any
disaster. But that could not be, because their hearts were not fixed, trusting
in the Lord. And how Socrates (the best of them) staggered and faultered when
he came to dye, appears by his last speech, as it is related both by Plato
and Cicero.

Verse. 8. His heart is established] Heb. Underpropped, shored up.

He shall not be afraid] Of any adverse power, Psalm. 3. and 27.

Until he see his desire] Which his faith will once work out.

Verse. 9. He has dispersed] Or, made a scatter, yet with discretion, giving
liberally, but most of all where is most need, and with a specialty of respect
to the family of says, Gal. 6.

His righteousness endures for ever] The reward of his charity is lasting, or
his charity is never at an end; Sic vocat ele^mosynas. Aben-Ezr.
he gives after that he has given, as a spring runs after it has run, as
the Sun shines after it has shone. See a Cor. 8.

His horn shall be exalted] i.e. His head, as 1 Samuel 2.1, 10.

Verse. 10. The wicked shall see it] Vir improbus and reprobus; The covetous
Caitiff who sat a brood upon his bags, and befooled the bountiful man, shall
himself come to beggary, which he so much feared, and be ready to eat his own
nayis through envy at the others prosperity; and because he cannot come at his
heart, he seeds upon his own, yea puts himself into an hell above ground, both
for pain of loss, and pain of sense, as here.

PSALM. CXIII.
Verse. 1. Hallelujah] See Psalm. 111.1.

Praise, Oye servants of the Lord] None but such can do it, or are fit for it;
and for such, praise is comely, Psalm. 147.1. as unthankfulness is an ugly sin,
but especially in Ministers, those servants of the Lord, by a specialty.

Praise the name of the Lord] Ter repetit, Trinitatem subindicando, says One;
Others note that by this threefold Praise ye, the Psalmist taxes men's dullness,
and exciteth their diligence to this divine duty.

Verse. 2. Blessed be the Name of the Lord] Praise him with utmost intension and
extension of spirit and of speech. God is therefore called by an appellative
proper, The blessed One Baruc-bu, Mark. 14.61. Luke 1.68.

From this time, etc.] A nunc and usque.

Verse. 3. From the rising of the Sun] i. e. All the world over, in all places
and at all times. North and South are not mentioned (but included) because not
so well peopled.

Verse. 4. Aug.
The Lord is high, etc.] He looks on the earth as on a Ant-hillock. All
Nations to him are but as a drop of a bucket, Isa. 40. Quantilla ergo es in
istius gu^^ae particula?

And his glory above the heavens] These are as far beneath him in glory, as in
situation. Angels understand him not fully.

Verse. 5. Who is like, etc] See Psalm. 89.6. He Is imparallel.

Who dwells on high] Heb. Who exaheth to dwell. Oh that we could fly, a
pitch any way proportionable by exalting his Name together, Psalm. 34.3.

Verse. 6. Who humbles himself] Lo, it is a condescension in God to vouchsafe
to look one of himself upon the Saints and Angels, how much more upon us? Since
fin se^teth us ^urt her beneath a worm, than a worm is beneath an Angel.

Verse. 7. He raises up the poor, etc.] David for instance, besides many
others; as Agathecles, (...), Maximinianus, etc. whom he raised from the lowest
stair to the very highest step of honor and opulency.

Verse. 8. That he may set him with Princes] See 1 Samuel 2.8. Hannabs song, where
of this seems to be an abridgement.

Verse. 9. He (...) the (...) we man to keep house] Heb. To dwell in an house,
that is, to have a house full of Children, and so to build her husbands house,
Ruth 4.11. This is applied to the Church (which is the theater of the World,
wherein God shows his special providence and power) Isa. 54, 1. Gal. 4.26,
27.

PSALM. CXIV.
Verse. 1 When Israel went out of Egypt] Emedie gentis, idest ex viscoribus
Aegyptiorum, qui ^^s quasi deglutiebant, out of the midst of that Nation, Mid.
Tillim. in Psa. 114.
that is, out of the bowels of the Aegpytians, who had as it were devoured
them; thus the Jew-doctors gloss upon this Text.

From a people of strange language] And yet more estranged affections, jearing
them, and their Religion, as the word Lognez (which is of affinity with Logneg
a scoffer) seems to sound. Afterward it was prophesied that five Cities in
the land of Egypt should speak the language (or lip) of Canaan, Isa. 19.18.
viz. when the Lord should turn to them, a pure language, Zeph. 3.9.

Verse. 2. Judah was his sanctuary] Or Sanctity, or Sanctification. This was an
happy change for them, from their Egyptian Idolatry, Ezekiel. 23.19. like as it
was from their Egyptian servitude, when Israel became Gods dominions,
dominations and signiories.

Verse. 3. The Sea saw it and fled] When God will deliver his people, and
perform his promises unto them, nothing shall hinder, but all Creatures shall
contribute their helps; for they are all his servants, Psalm. 119.91.

Verse. 4. The Mountains skipped like Rams] scil. at the giving of the law,
Exodus 19.18. which also causes heart-quakes in believers; but the unjust
knows no shame, Zeph. 3.5. is past feeling, Ephesians. 4.19.

Verse. 5 What ailed thee, O thou Sea] Or, what came to thee? can there any
natural reason be given? or was it Gods powerful presence only that caused
you to run retrograde? Atheists and unbleevers will search the Devils scull to
find out something whereby they may elevate Gods great works, and elude his
Arguments; as Pharaoh sat not down under the miracle, but sent for the
Magicians, and hardened his own heart.

Verse. 6 Ye Mountains that ye skipped, etc.] These two verses teach us, says
One, that we may many times ask questions, and yet neither doubt of the
matters, nor be ignorant in them.

Verse. 7 Tremble thou Earth, f] Heb. See in pain as a traveling woman; for if
the giving of the law had such dreadful effects, what should the breaking
thereof have?

At the presence of the God of Jacob] Whom Jacob, that is. Gods covenanted
people, knows and confideth in a midst all his austerities, Isa. 63.16. and
can boldly say, as Hab. 1.12. Art not thou from everlasting O Lord my God mine
holy one? we shall not dye.

Verse. 8 Which turned the rock into a standing water] Set the Rock of Rephidi^^
abroach, and made it not only a standing water ( stagnum, as here) but a
running river; for the Rock followed them; and that Rock was Christ, 1 Cor.
10.4. with Joh. 4.14. and 7.38.

The Flint into a fountain of Waters] Still God works for his people, in
oppositis mediis (as Luther expresses it) by contrary means, and rather than
they shall want necessaries, he both can and will work miracles.

PSALM. CXV.
Verse. 1 Not on to us Lord, not unto us] This is the godly man's (...), and his
daily practice. See Genesis 41.16. Act. 3.12, 16. 1 Cor. 15.10. Luke 19.16. Nor
we, but thy Talents have gained other five, Georg. Fabr^^. (...) vivus de
scips^^.
and other two, etc. Fabricius studuit been de pietate mereri;
Sed quicquid petuit, gloria, Christ, tua est.


There is no merit at all in us, faith the Chaldee here; the bowls of the
Candlestick had no oil but that which dropped from the Olive-branches. It is
therefore very good counsel that (...) gives his friend (...) illi do (...); In
all thy good deeds give God the glory, and take up ^lowly thoughts of thy self.

Verse. 2 Wherefore should the Heathen say] Why should they thus be suffered or
occasioned to blaspheme thee, and twit us with our Religion? Hence some
conceive that this Psalm was made in the time of the babylonish captivity by
Daniel (says one Jew-doctor) when he expounded Nebuchadnezzars dream; by the
three Worthies (says Another) when they were in the fiety furnace. See Psalm.
42.10 and 79.10.

Verse. 3 But our God is in the Heavens] Where your terricula your
fray-bugmawmets never were; like as one being asked by a Papist, where was your
Religion before Luther? answered, In the Bible, where your Religion never was.
This But seems uttered with indiguation. (...), says Basil, on a like
occasion; Our God is no dunghill-deity.

He has done whatsoever be pleased] Without either help or hinderance of any.

Verse. 4 Their Idols are silver and gold] Take them at the best, they are no
better; and what is silver and gold but the guts and garbage of the earth? But
some of them might say as Priapus in Horace, Olim truncus eram ficulnus inutile
lignum.

Herodotus tells us, In Euterpe.
that Amasis had a large laver of gold, wherein both he and his guests used to
wash their feet. This Vessel he brake and made a God of it; which the
Egyptians devoutly worshipped. And the like Idolomany is at this day found among
Papists; what distinction soever they would fain make betwixt an Idol and an
Image, which indeed (as they use them) are all one.

The work of men's hands] And therefore they must needs be goodly gods, when
made by bunglers especially, Act. and Mon. fol. 1340.
as was the rood of Cookram; which if it were not good enough to make a God,
would make an excellent Devil, as the Mayor of Doncaster merrily told the
complainants.

Verse. 5 They have mouths, but speak not] Unless the Devil happily speak in
them, and by them, as at Delphos; or the false Priests, as here in times of
Popery.

Eyes have they, But they see not] And yet with wires and other devises they
were made here once to goggle their eyes, Act. and Mon.
to move their chaps apace, as well a paid when something of worth was
presented them; as if otherwise, to look at eyes end, and to hang a lip.

Verse. 6 They have cars, but they hear not] But are as deaf as door-nails, to
the prayers of their suppliants. The Cretians pictured their Jupiter without
ears; so little hearing or help they hoped for from him. Socrates in contempt
of Heathen Gods, swore by an Oak, a Goat, a Dog; as holding these better (gods
than those. Varro says, Aug. de Civit. Dei.lib. 4.^2.31.
They that first brought in pictures to be worshipped, Ii civitatibus suis and
meturn dempserunt, and errorem addiderunt, took away fear, and brought in
error.

Noses have they, but they smell not] As the Painter may paint a flower with
fresh colors, but not with sweet savor, with this Motto, No further than
colors; so the Carver may draw out an image, but not make it draw in the
breath, with this Motto. No further than fashion.

Verse. 7 They have hands, but they handle not] Curious and artificial (for Art
is Natures ape) but useless, and for show only. (if Esculapius, or the Lady of
Loretto restore the lame or the blind, it is the Devil with his lying wonders,
2 These. 2.

Feet have they, bus they walk not] As those pictures in Plato made by Dedalus,
which if they were not bound; would fly away; or Vulcaus three-footed stools in
Homer, which (...) ^eigned to have run on wheels of their own accord, to the
meeting of the Gods; and after that to return in like fort back again. The
Tyrians besieged by Alexander chained up their God Hercules that he might not
go from them in that strait, and yet they were not delivered.

Neither speak they through their threat] They do not so much as chatter like a
Crane, or (...) a Dove, Isa. 38.14. (...) are (...) idols, as the Apostle
calls them. These are things commonly known (...) thus (...) for the (...) of
(...); who yet are so bewatched that they will needs (...) upon these gods of
their own making. O vanas hominum mentes, etc. -- O the spirit of fornication,
etc.

Verse. 8 They that make them, are like unto them] Blind and blockish, Vervecum
in patria crasseque sub aere nasi; given up by a just God to a judiciary
stupidity. See Isa. 44.9, 10, 11, etc. Rev. 9.20 their foolish hearts were
darkened, and they were delivered up to a reprobate sense, to an injudicious
mind, Romans 1. to strong delusions, vile affections, just damnation.

So is every one that trusts in them] Idols were never true to such as
trusted in them; but such deserve to be deceived, as being miserable by their
own election, Jon. 2.8.

Verse. 9 O Israel trust thou in the Lord] Whatever others do, Josh. 24.15. and
the rather, because others do not, Psalm. 119. the worse they are, the better
be ye.

He is their help, and their shield] God is engaged in point of honor to help
and protect those that trust in him.

Verse. 10. O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord] Ministers must be patterns to
others of depending upon God, and living by says; as did Mr. Bradshaw, Mr.
Lancaster, and many other famous Preachers of latter times, whom god inured to
a dependence from day to day upon his Providence for provisions; and (as a
grave man of God sometimes said, Whereas many others have, and eat their bread
stale) these received their bread, and ate it daily new from his holy hand.

Verse. 11 Ye that fear the Lord] Peregrini ex omni populo, says Aben-Ezra,
devout persons out of every Nation dwelling among the Jews, though not absolute
Proselytes, Act. 2.5. and 10.2. and 13 16. Such also fearing the Lord are heirs
of the promises; and therefore may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I
will not fear what man shall do unto me, Heb. 13.6.

Verse. 12 The Lord has been mindful of us, he will bless us] God has, God
will, is an ordinary Scripture- Medium, as has been aboye noted.

He will bless the house of Israel] Not help and keep them only, but bless
them with the blessings of both lives; for he is no penny-Father, etc. See
Ephesians. 1.3.

He will bless the house of Aaron] Ministers were ever a distinct order from
the rest. Note this against the Libertines who would gladly make a jumble,
Compass. Samar.
affirming the Ministry to be as arrant a juggle as the Papacy it self.

Verse. 13 He will blesse] Such shall abound with blessings, Prove. 28.20.

Both small and great] Whether in age or degree, Act. 10.34, 35.

Verse. 14 The Lord shall increase you] Or, The Lord increase you (derech
tephilla, prayer wise) as the Rabbines read it.

You and your Children] The care of whose welfare prevails far with religious
Parents, and sits close upon their spirits.

Verse. 15 You are the blessed of the Lord, etc. And therefore shall be
blessed, as Isaac said of his son Jacob, Genesis 27.33.

Which made Heaven and Earth] And will rather unmake both again, than you shall
want help, and comfort.

Verse. 16 The Heaven, even the heavens are the Lords] As the special place of
his delight and dwelling; yet not so as if he were there cooped up and
concluded; for God is immense and omnipresent, yea totally present, wheresoever
present. The Heavens have a large place, but they have one part here, and
another there, Not so the Lord; he is not commensurable by the place, but
every where all-present.

But the Earth has he given] Or, let out, as to his Tenants at will, for he
has not made them absolute owners to do therein what they will, and to live as
they list; Ye have lived in pleasure on the Earth, and been wanton, Jam. 5.5.
A heavy charge. Calvin tells of a loose fellow that used in his cups to allege
this text.

Verse. 17 The dead praise not] Therefore be active for God while we are upon
Earth; where for this he give thus life and livelihood. See Psalm. 6.6.

Verse. 18 But we will bless the Lord] For if he lose his praise in us, he
will lose it altogether; and so all things will come to nothing; quod abfit^

PSALM. CXVI
Verse. ^ I love the Lord] Heb. I love: because the Lord has heard, etc. Vox
abrupta and ecliptica, an abrupt concise ecliptical expression, betokening an
inexpressible unconceiveable passion, or rather pang of love, such as
intercepteth his voice for a time, Sa^^^beo. Tremel.
till recollecting himself, and recovering his speech, he becomes able to
tell us, not only that he loves, or is well satisfied, but also why he
loves, and is all on a light flame as it were, viz.

Because he has heard my voice] Though but an inarticulate incondite voice:
Lam. 3.56. Thou have heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my
cry.

And my supplications] My prayers for grace, when better formed and methodized.

Verse. 2 because he has inclined his ear] As loath to lose any part of my
prayer, though never so weakly uttered; therefore he shall have my custom,
Psalm. 65.2. O thou that hear prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

As long as I live] Heb. in my days, that is say some, whilst I have a day to
live. Others sense it thus, In the time of my affliction (confer Psalm. 137.7.
Lam. 1.21.) which by the word days he notes to be of long continuance.

Verse. 3 The sorrows of death compassed mee] See Psalm. 18.4, 5. Pictura poetica
ingentium periculorum. Sorrows, or pangs, and those deadly ones, and these
compassed me as a bird in a snare, or a beast in a grin.

The pains of Hell (or the griefs of the grave) gat hold] Heb. Found me, as
Number. 32.23.

I found trouble and sorrow] Straits inextricable cause sorrows inexplicable.
The word signifies such sorrow as venteth it self by sighing, Isa. 35.10. and
51.11.

Verse. 4 Then called I upon the name of the Lord] That strong Tower, whereto
the Righteous run and are safe, Prove, 18.10. Others have other refuges, the
witch or Endor, the god of Ekron, the arm of flesh, etc.

O Lord I beseech thee] Ana, blandiontis and deprecantis particula. The
Psalmist here has a sweet way of insinuating, Sic and N^i Philem. 20. Rev. 1.7.
and getting within the Lord; which oh that we could skill of.

Deliver my soul] q.d. It is my soul, Lord, my precious soul that is sought
after; oh deliver my soul from the sword, my darling from the power of the dog,
Psalm. 18.20.

Verse. 5 Gracious is the Lord, etc.] Gracious God is said to be, and
merciful, that we despair not; Righteous also, that we presume not. Or,
faithful in performing his promises, as 1 John 1.9. and this was David's
comfort amidst his sorrows.

Verse. 6 The Lord preserves the simple] Heb. The perswasible (opposed to the
scorner, Prove. 19.25.) the plain-hearted (opposed to the guilefull, 2 Cor.
1.12. and 11.3. Romans 16.19.) the destitute of humane help, that commits
himself to God, and patiently rests on him for support and succor, Psalm.
102.1 -- 17.

I was brought low] Or, drawn dry; I was at a great under, at a low ebb; I was
exhausted or emptied as a pond, strengthlesse, succourlesse, clean gone in a
manner.

And he helped mee] The knowledge that David had of Gods goodness was
experimental. See the like, Romans 8.2. A Carnal man knows Gods excellencies
and will revealed in his word only, as we know far Countries by Maps; but an
experienced Christian, as one that has himself been long there, 1 Cor. 2.14,
15, 16.

Verse. 7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul] The Psalmist had been at a great deal
of unrest, and much off the hooks, as we say^ Now, having prayed (for prayer
has vim pacativam; a pacifying property) he calls his soul to rest; and
rocketh it asleep in a spiritual security. Oh learn this holy art; Acquaint
thy self with God, acquiesce in him, and be at peace; so shall good be done
unto thee, Job 22.21. Si^ Sabbathum Christi. Luth.

For the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee] Of Sertorius it is said, that
he performed his promises with words only. And of the Emperor Pertinax, that
he was magis blandus quam beneficus, rather kind spoken than beneficial to
any; Hinc dictus (...)
No^ so the Almighty.

Verse. 8. For thou have delivered my Soul, etc.] The better to excite himself
to true thankfulness, he enters into a particular enumeration of Gods
benefits. It is not enough that we acknowledge what God has done for us in
the lump, and by wholesale. See Exodus 18.8. how Moses brancheth out Gods
benefits: So must we, rolling them as Sugar, and making our utmost of them.

Verse. 9. I will walk before the Lord] Indefinenter a^bulabo: I will not only
take a turn or two with God, go three or four steps with him, etc. but walk
constantly and in all duties, before him, with him, after him. Hypocrites do
not walk with God, but halt with him, they follow him as a Dog does his Master,
till he comes by a carrion; they will launch no further out into the main than
they may be sure to return at pleasure safe again to the shore.

In the land] i.e. here in this world, called also the light of the living,
Psalm. 56.13. and 52.5. Job 28.13.

Verse: 10. I believed, therefore have I spoken] Fundamentum et fulcrum vera
spei est fides viva. Hope is the daughter of faith, but such as is a staff to
her aged mother; and will produce a bold and wise profession of the truth
before men, as also earnest prayer to God. It is as the Cork upon the Net:
though the lead on the one side sink it down, yet the Cork on the other keeps
it up. Some translate the words thus: I believed, when I said, I am greatly
afflicted: I believed when I said in my haste, all men are Liars. q. d. Though
I have had my offs and my ons, though I have passed through several frames of
heart, and tempers of soul in my trials, yet I believed still, I never let go
my hold, my gripe of God in any perturbation.

Verse. 11. I said in my haste] in my heat, trepidation, concussion, out-burst.
Saints may have such, as being but men, subject to like passions; and as
meeting with many molestations, satanical and secular; and left sometimes to
themselves by God, as was good Hezekiah, for their trial and exercise. The Sea
is not so calm in summer, but has its commotions: the mountain so firm, but
may be moved with an Earthquake. Dogs in a chafe bark sometimes at their own
masters; So do men in their passions let fly at their best friends. When the
taste is vitiated, it mistastes. When there is a suffusion in the eye (as in
case of the jawndise) it apprehends colors like it self: So here. Abraham felt
the motion of trepidation; meek Moses was over-angry at Meribah; so was Job,
Jonas, Jeremy, etc. Ira comes of Ire, say Grammarians: because an angry man
goes out of himself, off from his reason; and when pacified, he is said,
redire ad se, to return to himself.

All men are Lyars] Prophets and all: Samuel has deluded me I doubt, in
promising me the Kingdom, which I shall never come to, see 1 Samuel 27.1. Some
make the meaning to be thus, what can I hope for, seeing every man betrayeth
me, and that I can trust no body? The truth is, that every man is a liar,
either by imposture, and so in purpose, or by impotency, and so in the event,
deceiving those that rely on him, Psalm. 62.9.

Verse. 12. What shall I render unto the Lord] This he speaks as one in an
ecstasy, ( Amor Dei est ecstaticus) or in a deep demurre what to do best for so
good a God: Such self-deliberations are very useful, and acceptable, and
thereunto are requisite. 1 Recognition of Gods favors. 2 Estimation. 3
Retribution, as here.

Verse. 13. I will take the cup of salvation] Calice^ salut^^, vel omnis
salutis, Vatab. Trem.
as in the drink offerings, or as at the feast after the peace offerings, see
(1 Chronicles. 16.3.) wherein the feast-maker was wont to take a festival great cup;
and in lifting it up to declare the occasion of that feast, and then, in
testimony of thankfulness, to drink thereof to the guests, that they in order
might pledge him. This was called a cup of salvation, or a health-cup, but not
in the Drunkards sense. Vatab.
To this the Apostle seems to allude, 1 Cor. 10.17. when he calls the
sacramental cup, the cup of blessing. Heirom renders it, calicum Jesu
accipium.

And call upon the name of the Lord] Pray unto him, and so praise him. Or I
will proclaim, and preach his praises, as 1 Pet. 2.^.

Verse. 14. I will pay my vows,] This word pay, imports that vows lawfully
made are due debt: and debt, till paid, is a disquieting thing to an honest
mind, Romans 13.8. The Saints, in distress especially, used to make their
Prayers with vows. Hence prayer is in Greek called (...), a service with vows.
Mr. Philpot Martyr, ^cts and Men.
first coming into Smithfield to suffer, kneeled down and said, I will pay my
vows in thee, O Smithfield.

Verse. 15. Precious in the sight of the Lord] Rara, chara. God does not often
suffer his Saints to be slain, Psalm. 37.32, 33. Or if he do, he will make
inquisition for every drop of that precious blood, Psalm. 9.12. See Psalm. 72.14.
with the Note. This David delivers here as a truth, that he had experimented.

Verse. 16. O Lord, truly I am thy servant, I am thy servant] Euge, O Jehovah,
etc. by a real and an heavenly complement; thus he insinuates, and therefore
promises praise to God, verse. 17. and safety to himself, according to that
Psalm. 119.94 I am thine, save me.

And the Son of thine handmaid] That is, of Ruth, say the Rabbines: or rather
of his immediate mother, Quia religiosi^r patre. Gene^r.
a good woman, and happily better than his Father; as Monoahs wife had a stronger
faith than himself; and Priscilla is named before her husband Aquila.

And the Son of they handmaid] Not born abroad, and bought or brought into thy
family: but tuus quasi vernaculus, et a ventre ad serviendum dispositus, born
and bred up to thy service, of a child little.

Thou have loosed my bonds] Of affliction, of corruption, and made me Christ's
freeman, brought me into the glorious liberty of thine own Children.

Verse. 17. I will offer to thee, etc.] I will perform to thee not ceremonial
service only, but Moral, and spiritual; such as thou shall accept through
Christ, Col. 3.17. And will call, etc.] see verse. 13.

Verse. 18. I will pay] See verse. 14.

Now] Vows were to be paid without either diminution or delays, Deuteronomy. 23.21,
23. And herein Jacob (who is by the Hebrews called Votorum Pater, the Father of
vows) was too short: for it was long ere he went up to Bethel.

In the presence of all his people] For good example sake. This also was
Prince-like, Ezekiel. 46.10. the Kings seat in the Sanctuary was open, that all
might see him there. 2 King 11.14. and 23.3.

Verse. 19. In the Courts of the Lords house] In coetu sacro; in the great
Congregation, Psalm. 22.25. and 66.13. where there is a more powerful, lively,
and effectual working of the Spirit, Psalm. 89.7. Heb. 4.1. 1 Cor. 14.24.

PSALM. CXVII.
Verse. 1. O praise the Lord all ye Nations] viz. For Christ that gift, Joh. 4
10. that benefit, 1 Timothy 6.2. that desire of all Nations, Hag. 2.7. that good
tidings of great joy to all people, Luke 2.10 who are by him received into the
glory of God, Kimchi.
Romans 15.7, 11. where the Apostle thus applies this Scripture; and the
Jew-Doctors confess that this short and sweet Psalm, is to be understood de
beneficiis Messiae, of Christ, and his benefits.

Praise him all ye people] Laudationibus commendate eum, so Tremel: renders
it, praise him with a force, and as it were with a violence, with all your
might, ye cannot possibly over-do.

Verse. 2. For his merciful kindness is great] Invaluit, has prevailed over
us, breaking through all obstacles and impediments, whether within us or
without us; eating its way through all rocks and remoraes, and though we would
put it back, yet it will overcome us: his grace is irresistible, neither can it
ever be taken away.

And the truth of the Lord] As his mercy alone moved him to make promise, so
his Truth binds him to perform the same. See 2 Samuel 7.18, 21. The word of
promise binds God, and therefore it may seem to be stronger than God. If his
merciful kindness prevail over us, as verse. 1. his truth prevails over him.
The Jew doctors observe that the word Emeth, here used for truth, consists of
Aleph, the first letter of the Alphabet; Midrach. ^illine.
M^^ the middlemost letter thereof, and Tan the last: to show that as God is
Alpha and Omega, so the truth of God is the All in all of our comfort. Grace
and Truth came by Jesus Christ this is the sum of all the good news in the
World.

PSALM. CXVIII.
Verse. 1. O give thanks, etc.] See Psalm. 106.1.

Verse. 2. Let Israel now say] All the Israel of God, for only such are fit to
praise God: excellent words become not a fool; the Lepers lips are to be
covered.

Verse. 3. Let the house of Aaron now say] Ministers are Chieftains, Heb. 13.7,
17. and should be as the chief Chanters in Gods praises.

Verse. 4. Let them now that fear the Lord say] See Psalm. 115.11. and observe,
that the Psalmist beats upon the (...) (as does also the Apostle, 2 Cor.
6.^.) Now, now, now, says he; because, for ought we know, it is now or never, to
day or not at all; the dead praise thee not, Psalm. 6.6.

That his mercy, etc.] This is the fourth time in four verses, as Psalm. 136. in
every one of those twenty six verses, like as a Bird that having gotten a Note
records it over and over.

Verse. 5 I called upon the Lord in distress] Heb. out of distress, q. d. I
celebrate not God mercy of course, but out of experience.

The Lord answered me] Heb. Jah answered me with a large r^^^^th. See Psa. 4.2

Verse. 6. I will not fear, etc.] See Psalm. 36.4, 11.

Verse. 7. The Lord takes my part with them that help me] Not only as one of my
helpers, but instead of all, and more than all. How many reckon ye me at? said
that General to his Soldiers, who were afraid of their enemies numbers; Cui
adhaereo praest, He whom I take part with must needs prevail.

Verse. 8. It is better to trust in the Lord, etc.] Luther on this text calls
it, Artem artium, and mirificam, ac suam artem, non fidere hominibus, that is,
the Art of Arts, and that which he had well studied, not to put confidence in
man; as for trust in God, he calls it, Sacrificium omnium gratissimum and
suavissimum, and cultum omnium pulcherrimum, the most pleasant and sweetest of
all Sacrifices, the best of all services we perform to God.

Than to put confidence in man] Quia mutatur aut fortuna, aut voluntas, aut
vita, says Genebrard, because either men may dye, or their affections may dye,
or their wealth decay.

Verse. 9. Than to put confidence in Princes] In ingenuis. Great men's words,
says one, are like dead men's shoes; he may go barefoot that waits for
them. Surely men of high degree are a lie, Psalm. 62.9.

Verse. 10. All Nations compassed me about] This is still the condition of
Christ's Church in this evil world, to be hated of all, and set against with
utmost might and malice. Haud perinde crimine incendii quam odio humani generis
convicti sunt, says Tacitus of those Christians at Rome put to cruel deaths by
Nero, who having for his pleasure fired the City fathered it upon them, as
people hated of all men.

But in the name of the Lord] i.e. by faith in Gods power and promises. We
might also do great exploits against our Spiritual enemies, did we but set upon
them with Gods arms, and with his armor; did we but observe the Apostles rule,
Whatsoever ye do in word, or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, etc.
Col. 3.17.

Verse. 11. They compassed me about, yea etc.] They thought to make sure work of
me indeed, as Saul and his men, when they hemmed him in at M^on, 1 Samuel 23.26.
as the Churches enemies, when they had gotten her, as a Bird into the s^a^^ of
the Fowler, Psalm. 124.7. as when the adversaries said, They shall not know,
neither see, till we come in the midd^st among them, and stay them Ne^. 4.11.

But in the name of the Lord I will destroy them] E^^rva^^, ^^eid^^, The word
signifies, Non (...) dormi^uti ^^^i^g^r^ vict^ri^^, sed ^^rtami and pr^l^a^^i,
Moller. Plat. in Syl.
that he foiled not his foes without pains and peril. Towns were said to come
into Th^^th^us his toyls whiles he slept: but that was but a fiction of those
that (...) him.

Verse. 12. They ^^^possed me about like Bees] Like so many swarms of Bees,
which being angered -- Ven^^^m
Morsibus inspirant, and spicula caca relinqnunt
Affixa venis, animasque in (...) p^^^^t. Virgil.



Bees to be revenged lose their stings, Arist^t.
and therewith their lives, or at least they become drones ever after. Wicked
men are no less spiteful; they care not to undo themselves, so they may wrong
the Saints; yea they are not unlike the Scorpion, of which Pliny says, that
there is not one minute wherein it does not put forth the sting.

They are quenched (or kindled) a^ the fire of thorns] Which is quickly
kindled, and as quickly quenched, Ex spinis non ^^un: exbones (...).
leaving no coals behind it. See Eccles. 7.6. The enemies of the Church may
make a blaze, but they are but a blast.

Verse. 13. Thou have thrust sore at me] Thou, O Saul, or thou Ishbibenob, 2 Samuel 21.16. or thou, O Satan, setting such a work.

But the Lord helped mee] He sent from heaven and saved me: he came in the
nick of time, as it were out of an Engine.

Verse. 14. The Lord is my strength and song] i.e. The matter of my song, and
mean of my joy. Trust in God shall once triumph.

Verse. 15. The voice of rejoicing, etc.] q.d. Though themselves are but
travelers, and their habitations tabernacles or tents; yet are they not
without the joy of their salvation, which is unspeakable, and full of glory; so
that they go merrily on their way feeding on this honeycomb (as once Sampson)
and Gods Statutes are their songs in the house of their Pilgrimage, Psalm.
119.54.

The right hand of the Lord, etc.] This and that which follows is the
righteous man's ditty which he sings uncessantly. See on verse. 4.

Verse. Haec est vox Epini^il.
16 The right hand of the Lord is exalted] By right hand here some understand
the humanity of Christ, Gods hand and our handle, whereby we come to take hold
of God.

The right hand of the Lord does valiantly] Thrice he celebrateth Gods right
hand; to set forth his earnest desire to say the utmost; or in reference to the
sacred Trinity, as some will have it.

Verse. 17 I shall not dye, but live] This he was well assured of by Faith: as
was also the Church in Habbakkuk, chap. 1.12. Art not thou from everlasting, O
Lord my God, mine boly One? we shall not dye. Learned Keckerman lying on his
death bed, and desirous (if it had so pleased God) to have lived a while longer
for the finishing of those excellent pieces he had in hand, made use of these
words of the Psalmist, I shall not dye, but live, and declare the works of the
Lord (he was then upon his system of natural Philosophy) but God had
otherwise appointed it, and he submitted.

Verse. 18. The Lord has chastened me sore] Corripuit me seria and severa
castigatione; and yet David was his darling.

But he has not given me ever to death] It might have been worse may the
afflicted Saint say; and it will yet be better: It is in mercy, and in measure
that God chastises his Children. It is his care that the Spirit fail not
before him, nor the souls which he has made, Isa. 57.16. If his Child
swounds in the whipping, God lets fall the rod, and falls a kissing it, to
fetch life into it again.

Verse. 19 Open to me the gates of Righteousnesse] So the gates of the
Sanctuary are called, because holiness becomes Gods house for ever: to keep
out the profane, Porters were appointed. See 2 Chronicles, 23.19. and such were the
Ostiarii in the primitive Church; their word was Canes for as, Dogs out of
doces. See Reve. 22.15. Prosper.


Verse. 20 This gate of the Lord] Some make the former verse the request of the
people, and this to be Gods answer thereunto. Others make that to be David's
speech to the (...), and this their answer, q.d. This beautiful gate is fit to
be opened to the Lord alone: if others enter, they must be righteous ones
only, and that to praise him.

(...) which the Righteous shall (...)] scil. With Gods good leave and liking.
Others may happily thrust into the Church, but then God will say, Friend how
came thou in hither? who required these things at your hands? who sent for
you? O Generation of Vipers who has forewarned you to fly from the wrath to
come? The Sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more when he
brings it with a wicked mind? Prove. 21.27.

Verse. 21 I will praise thee, for thou have heard mee] Luther renders it,
because thou have humbled and afflicted me: but withal thou art become my
salvation.

Verse. 22 the stone which the builders refused] David, and the son of David
were by those, who seemed to be somewhat, laid aside, and slighted as abjects
and refuse ones; but wisdom was ever justified of her Children.

Is become the head-stone of the corner] Lap is dratonus sive frontatus,
whereby the Church is supported as the sides and weight of a building are by a
Principal binding cornerstone, against all blasts.

Verse. 23 This is the Lords doing] That David should ever come to the Kingdom,
that Christ should so be raised from the lowest ebb of humiliation to the
highest tide of exaltation, this is a wonder of wonders, a matchless miracle.

And it is mavelous in our eyes] As all Gods works are to those that have
spiritual senses habitually exercised: but especially the great work of man's
Redemption by Christ.

Verse. 24 This is the day which the Lord has made] The Queen of days, as the
Jews call the Sabbath. Arnob^us interprets this text, of the Christian
Sabbath: others, of the day of salvation by Christ exalted to be the
head-corner-stone; in opposition to that dismal day of man's fall.

We will rejoyce] Or, Let us rejoice. Dull we are, and heavy to spiritual
joy: and are therefore excited thereto.

Verse. 25 Save now I beseech thee] Hosanna, as Mat. 21.9 an usual acclamation
of the people to their new Kings.

Send now prosperity] God will send it, but his people must pray for it; I came
for thy prayers, Dan. 10.

Verse. 26 Blessed be he that commeth] Blessed be Christ. Scultet. Annal.
Vivat Christus ejusque insignia, said John Clark of Melda, when for declaring
against the Popes indulgences he was burnt in the forehead with a hot Iron.

We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord] Thus say the Priests to the
people. Ministers must bless those that bless Christ, saying, Grace be with
all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, Ephesians. 6.24. as if any
do not, let him be Anathema Maranatha, 1 Cor. 16.22.

Verse. 27 God is the Lord who has showed us light] By giving us the light of
the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. 4.6. he
has brought us out of darkness into his mavelous light, 1 Pet. 2.9.

Bind the Sacrifice with cords] Make them fast there, till the Priests shall
have time to offer them. Spare for no cost in showing your thankfullness for
Christ and his benefits. Some render it Obligate solennitates in frondosis:
Austin has it in confrequent at ionibus.

Verse. 28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee] The people are taught to say
thus; and the Greek, Arabic, and Latin translations repeat here, verse. 21. I
will praise thee, for thou have heard me; and art become my salvation. People
can never be sufficiently thankful for their salvation by Christ. It is their
duty, and should be their desire.

Verse. 29 O give thanks unto the Lord, etc.] Repetit proae^i^^ pro Epiloge. See
verse. 1.

PSALM. CXIX.
Verse. 1 Blessed are the undefiled] Pindarus and other Poets had their Ogdaades
or Octonaries. Lib. 4. Biblio^^
This Alphabeticall Poem (as Sixtus 8 (...) calls it) is David's doubtless
(though it has no title to show to much) written in the days of his
banishment under Saul; and far more worthy to be written in letters of gold
than Pind^^^ seventh Ode, which that profane fellow Politian preferred before
any Psalm of David, the sweet finger of Israel. How much better his Co^^^ (...)
Jacobus Furnius, who translated this Psalm into Greek and Latin verses, (...)
many Octonaries; and beginning each verse thereof with the same letter, after
the manner of the Hebrew composure; which is very artificial, both for the
excellency of the matter, and for the help of memory. The Jews are said to
teach it their little ones the first thing they learn; wherein they take a very
right course; both in regard of the heavenly matter, and plain style fitted for
all capacities. David (in his troubles especially) was a man much in meditation
of Gods word, and here he gives us in, his thoughts of it. When a book is set
forth, verses of commendation are often prefixed. David seems to set this
divine Psalm as a Poem of commendation before the Book of God; mentioning it in
every verse (unless it be one only, verse 122.) under the name of
Testimonies, Laws, Statutes, Word, Judgments, Precepts, etc.

Who walk in the Law of the Lord] Who walk toward Heaven in Heavens way;
avoiding the corruptions that are in the world through lust, 2 Pet. 1.4.

Verse. 2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies] Angels do so, and are
blessed, Rev. 22.9.

And that seek him] Sincere ac solicit That seek not his omnipresence (what
need they?) but his gracious presence.

Verse. 3 They also do no iniquity] i.e. No wilful wickedness; as do those
workers of iniquity, whose whole trade it is, and whose whole life is nothing
else but one continued web of wickedness, spun out and made up by the hands of
the Devil and the flesh, an evil spinner, and a worse weaver.

They walk in his wayes] Without cessation or cespitation.

Verse. 4 Thou have commanded us, etc.] These are verba vivenda, non legenda,
words to be lived, and not read only, as one well says of this whole Psalm;
neither is it enough that we understand or ponder Gods Precepts, but we must
practice them, if we would be happy.

To keep thy Precepts diligently] Nimis, valde, vehementer. Odi nimium
diligentes, says One; but where the business is weighty, and the failing
dangerous, one can hardly be too diligent. Let a man here do his utmost, he
shall not overdo.

Verse. 5 O that my ways were directed, etc.] David can wish well to that
perfection which he cannot attain unto. The whole life of a good Christian is
an holy desire, says Austin; and this is always seconded with endeavor;
without the which, Affection is like Rachel, beautiful but barren.

Verse. 6. Then shall I not be ashamed] i. e. I shall be highly honored both
by thee, and all thy people; able to look thee and them in the face, free from
an evil conscience.

When I have respect unto all thy Commandements] Mine obedience being universal
both for subject and object; this is a sure sign of sincerity, such as
entitleth a man to true blessedness, verse. 1. An Hypocrite is funam bulus
virtutum, as Tertullian phraseth it; he has a dispensatory conscience; his
obedience is partial, and such as goes in a narrow tract; it extends not to
the compass of the whole Law, and is therefore lost labor.

Verse. 7 I will praise thee with uprightnesse] David was yet but a learner; and
if God would teach him to profit in knowledge and holiness, he would lift up
many an humble, joyful and thankful heart to him.

Verse. 8 Lucan.
I will keep thy Statutes] Yea and that very much, or with vehemence, as some
read it, usque valde; this he had said before was Gods command, verse. 4. and
he would do it. Jussa sequi tam velle mihi quam posse necesse est.

O for sake me not] Or if at all (as thou may without breach of promise)
yet not very much; not usque valde; not utterly. Christ, says Greenham, was
forsaken for a few hours. David for a few months, and Job for a few years;
seven years, faith Suidas, for the trial and exercise of his faith and
patience. This might seem to them usque valde, but it was not (...). Leave them
God did to their thinking, but forsake them he did not; forsake them he did in
regard of vision, but not in regard of union: (...).

Verse. 9 Wherewith all shall a young man] (...), a lad, a stripling, who has
his name in Hebrew of (...) to (...) and the same word (...) when ^hi^^led
(...) vanity of youth and (...) once affections begin to boil within them. The
Greek word for a youth, comes from another that signifies to be hot, and to
boil up, or scald. (...)
Such a one therefore had need (if ever he think to be blessed, as verse. 1.)
to cleanse his ways by cleaving to the word: since an impure heart, and an
undefiled inheritance, will not stand together.

Cleanse his way] Mundabit, idest emen^abit. The Hebrew word signifies the
cleansing of glass, which though it be very clean, yet will it gather filth
even in the Sunbeams, and of it self; which notes the great corruption of
this slippery age, and what care must be taken that it may shine as picked
glass, or clearest Crystal.

By taking heed thereto according to thy word] Which is of a purifying
property, Job. 15.3. and 17.17. and can cleanse the heart of a young man also,
where lusts are strong, stains deep, and will not out without fullers soap.
There is a sharpness in these wholesome (or healing) words, that makes us
sound in the faith, and sincere in practice; as it did Mr. Paul Bains, whose
conversation, when he came first to Cambridge, was so irregular, that his
Father being grieved at it before his death, left with a friend forty pounds by
the year, desiring that his son might have it if he amended his manners: else
not. He did so, and had it, etc. Mr. Clark lives.
When a Child is come to be thirteen years and a day old, the Jews account him
a man and call him Barmitsuah, a child of the Commandment: because bound to
live by the law. Leo M^den^ o^ Jew^rite^.


Verse. 10. With my whole heart have I sought thee] And that of a child little,
being nourished up in the words of faith, and of good Doctrine, 1 Timothy 4.6. I
did all the wills of God, and so became a man after his own heart, Act. 13.22.

O let me not wander] As I shall surely, if thou but withdraw thy grace; for I
subsist merely by thy manutension.

Verse. 11 Thy word have I hid in my heart] Ut peculium in Apotheca; as
treasure; or as an amulet in a case or Chest; as the pot of Manna in the Ark.

That I might not sin against thee] Set but the commination against the
temptation, and it will be a special preservative. Eve held the Precept, but
faltered in the threat. The Rabbines have a saying, In cu^us cord est lex Dei,
im^ginatio mala non habet in eum dominium, He who has the law of God in his
heart, is armed against evil lusts.

Verse. 12 Blessed art thou (or he thou) O Lord] viz. For what thou have
already taught me of thy will, and my duty.

Teach me thy Statutes] Gratiarum actio est ad plus dandum invitatio. David
had never enough, but craveth more: Teach me thy Statutes, says he, that I
may bless thee better.

Verse. 13 With my lips have I declared] Heb. Have I sip^ered up; these have
been the matter of my discourse: and out of the good treasure of my heart (
verse. 11.) have I brought forth those good things, for the good of others, Mat.
12.35.

Verse. 14 I have rejoyced] Heb. I have inwardly rejoiced. Pleasures of the mind
are unspeakably joyous. Eudoxus was content to have been burnt by the Sun
presently, might he but come so near it as to learn the nature of it. Pliny
perished by peeping into the fire of Etna, Archimedes lost his life by being
too intent upon his Mathematical studies.

As much as in all riches] Heb. In all oppulency and affluence.

Verse. 15 I will meditate] Or, Confabulate, talk freely of them, (...) Sept.
as worldlings do of their wealth, and ways to get it

And have respect unto thy wayes] As an Archer has to his mark.

Verse. 16. I will delight my self] Deliciabor; the Arabic has it, lectitabo
leges tu as, I will often read over thy laws.

I will not forget] Men do therefore forget the word, because they delight not
in it; they seldom forget where they lay their money.

Verse. 17 Deal bountifully with thy servant] Per indebitam gratiam ^etribue. Of
thy free grace confer good upon me: and that not scantily, or niggardly, but
liberally, and like thy self. The word sometimes signifies to repay, to
recompense: but therehence to infer matter of merit, on man's part, is too sandy
a foundation for such a lofty Babel.

That I may live] Who am in deaths often; and that I may comfortably subsist in
the feeling of thy favor, as 1 Samuel 25.6.

And keep thy word] For which end only I desire life: See the like, Psalm.
118.17. Non peto vit^m prop^^r deli^^^ (...) Kimchi.
Non aliter pelit vitam, quam ut prastet se fidelem Dei (...), says (...),
David does no otherwise desire life, than for this, that he may faithfully
serve God.

Verse. 18. Open thou mine eyes] Heb. Vnveil the^, velumen um^ot, (...) evolve,
give sight and light; irradiate both organ and object. In spirituals we are
not only dim-sighted, but blind as Beetles, 1 Cor. 2.14. Oh pray for that
precious eyesalve, Rev. 3.17. for that supernal light, 2 Cor. 4.6. and
whenever we open the Bible to read, say as here, open thou mine eyes, etc.
as when we close it up again say, I have seen an end of all perfection: but
thy Commandment is exceeding broad, verse. 96.

Wondrous things] M^rabilia magnalia, mysteria; such as none can understand and
unriddle, but such as plow with Gods own heifer, 1 Cor. 2.11.

Verse. 19. I am a stranger in the earth] And therefore apt to lose my way,
without a guide: I shall surely else be wildred; and lost.

Hide not thy Commandments from mee] viz. In the spiritual sense, and
effectual operation of them. Philosophers observe, that lumen est vehiculum
influentiae, light is the convoy of influence; as it begets the flower in the
field, the pearl in the earth, etc. so the foundation of all renovation is
Illumination; Hence David so earnestly beggeth it here, and verse. 17.

Verse. Comminuit^r, (...).
20 My soul breaketh] The Seventy render it, My soul has desired to desire thy
Judgments. How many broken spirits do even spend and exhale themselves in
continual sallies, as it were, and egressions of affection to God and his
judgments? The stone will fall down to come to its own place, though it break
it self in many pieces: so the good soul.

Verse. 21. Thou have rebuked the proud, etc.] Thou chidest them, threatenest
them, plaguest them, and so set it on, as no creature can take it often. And
this is one reason why I love and observe thy laws, ne paria pat^ar, lest I
should suffer in like sort: since men must do it, or dye for it.

Verse. 22 Remove from me reproach and contempt] Cast upon me by those proud
haughty scorners. verse. 21. and that for nothing but because I keep thy
Statutes: therefore it is that they despise and defame me; but do thou, Lord,
take an order with them: behold I put them into thine hands, and my self upon
thy care to clear me, and set me right; for I am well resolved.

Verse. 23 Princes also did sit, etc.] (...)
By public invectives: such as were those of our Henry the eighth, and of
Lewis King of Hungary and Bohemia (two very potent Princes) against Luther.
Denotat continuum clam^rem. Kimchi.


Verse. 24. Thy Testimonies are my delight] In medi^^ crucibus: to them I run as
to my cordial; they are my pleasure, and pastime.

And my Counsellours] My learned Counsel, by whose advice I do all, here I am
sure to find consolationem, and consultissi^am directionem, counsel and
comfort in all my necessities.

Verse. 25 My soul cleaves unto the dust] Those Princes my Persecutors ( Saul's
counselors) have brought me to deaths-doore, as Psalm. 44.25. and 22.15. I am
in a forlorn condition; as far below hope, as they are above ^ear. Theodoret
expounds it of humility: and Theodosius the Emperor used these words, when
reproved by Ambrose for the slaughter at Thessalonica, Theod. Eccle^. hist. l.
5. c. 18.
he lay on the ground and humbly begged pardon.

Verse. 26 I have declared my wayes] My sins and troubles; those thou have
remitted, and these thou have remedied.

Teach me thy Statutes] Show me how I may walk worthy of such a love; and
live up to my mercies.

Verse. 27 Make me to understand, etc. Give me a mouth and wisdom, that I may
not talk at random of thy word and works; but understandingly and fruitfully.

Verse. 28 My soul melteth] Heb. Droppeth away like water: I weep out my life,
together with my grief.

Strong thou thee me (...) to thy word] Support ^^ee by thy promise.

Verse. 29 Remove from me the way of lying] A sin that David, through
diffidence, fell into frequently. See 1 Samuel 21.2, 8. where he roundly tells
three or four lies: and the like he did, 1 Samuel 27.8, 10. this evil he saw by
himself; and here prays against it.

And grant me thy Law] For a preservative from this soul sin: herein gratfie
^^ee, good Lord.

Verse. 30 I have chosen the way of Truth] I am fully bent against lying, and am
resolved to speak truth; though I have done otherwise sometimes, through
frailty.

Thy Judgments have I laid before mee] Thereby to fright my conscience, that I
might not so much as equivocate. Some render it judicia tua (...), I have kept
pace with thy judgments, scil. in the bent and bias of my heart at least.

Verse. 31 I have stuck unto thy Testimonies] Hitherto I have done so: let me
not now shrink from them, or hang loose to them, lest I lose the things that I
have wrought, and shame my self for ever by my recidivation.

Verse. 32 I will run the way] Do thy work with utmost diligence and delight,
come off roundly and readily therein, take long strides toward heaven.

When thou shall enlarge my heart] By thy free Spirit, and by the joy of faith;
when thou shall have oyled my joints, and nimbled my feet, then shall I run and
not be weary, walk and not faint, Isa. 40.31. our promises of obedience must be
conditional, since without Christ we can do nothing, Jo^. 15.5.

Verse. 33. Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes] Which is both hard to
hit, and dangerous to miss teach me therefore.

And I shall keep it] Lex jubet, gratia juvat. O beg of God that we may
persevere, since the evening crowns the day, etc.

Verse. 34. Give me understanding] We can neither know, nor do Gods will
without Divine light and aid, as appears clearly by this fifth Octonary, which
therefore Austin made so great use of against the Pelagians.

Verse. 35. Make me to go in the path] Which I shall soon forsake if thou guide
me not. Te duce vera sequer, te duce falsa nego.

For therein do I delight] After the inward man, Romans 7.22. Thou have given me
to will, give me also to work what is wel-pleasing in thy sight.

Verse. 36. Incline my heart] Through the exercises of thy Word, and the working
of thy Spirit.

And not ^o c^vetousness] Which draws away the heart from all Gods
testimonies, and is the ^opt of all evil, 1 Timothy 6.10. Some think it is put
here for all other vices. The Chald^e has it, And not to Mammon, that mammon
of iniquity, as Christ calls it, the next odious name to the Devil. Now to
good, God inclines man's heart efficiently (say the Schools) but to evil,
defici^^ly, sc. by with drawing his grace; for he is a free Agent, and not
bound to any. David prays God to supersede him from his wickedness and Luther
says, he was never tempted to it.

Verse. 37. Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity.] Lest looking cause
liking, and lusting, 1 John 2.16. In Hebrew the same word signifies both an
Eye, and a Fountain^ to show that from the eye, as from a fountain, flows
much mischief, and by that window Satan often winds himself into the soul. 2 Samuel 11. ^
This David found by experience and therefore prays here, Turn away, transfer,
make to pass mine eyes, etc. Job steppeth one degree further, viz. from a
Prayer to a Vow, Chap. 31.1. yea from a vow to an imprecation, verse. 7. He knew
the danger of irregular glancing, and inordinate gazing.

And quicken thou me in thy way] Who shall else dye of the wound in the eye.
Alexander called the Persian Maids, Oculorum delores: Ut vidi, ut perii -- The
Israelites were appointed to make them Fringes with blew Ribbands to look upon,
that they might remember all Gods Commandments and do them, and not seek after
their own heart, and their own eyes, after) which they used to go a who^ing,
Numb. 15.^9.

Verse. 38. Stablish thy word unto thy Servant] i.e. Make good thy promise: we
must by our prayers put the promises of God in (...) and God will (...)

Who is devoted to thy fear] And so am an heir of the Promises. Or, which
(word) is (given) for the fear of thee, that thou may be feared.

Verse. 39. Turn away my reproach] Cover it, cure it, suffer it not to break
forth to my disgrace amongst men.

For thy Judgments are good] But their tender mercies are mere cruelties, if
therefore at any time I fall into opprobrious and reproachful practices, Lord,
be thou my Judge, and not they; for thy Judgments are like thy self, good,
and righteous, etc.

Verse. 40. Behold, I have longed after thy precepts] This he could boldly and
safely say to God, offering himself to his trial for the truth of his desires.
See Hebr. 13.18.

Quicken me in thy righteousness] His desires and affections were not so large
and lively, but that he needed to be yet further quickened -- Nemo est ex omni
part beatus.

Verse. 41. Let thy mercies come also unto me] Let them come to me, or else I
shall never come to them, 1 Pet. 1.13. Hope to the end, for the grace that is
to be brought unto you. Psalm. 23.6. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me,
as the setting Sun does the way faring man, that goes from it. The Arabic
renders it, Let thy mercies come upon me, or cover me, as a garment. So the
Spirit of the Lord clothed Amasa, 1 Chronicles. 12. and, ye shall be clothed
with power from on high, Luke 24.49.

Even thy Salvation] Safety here, and Salvation hereafter. Austin expounds it
of Christ.

Verse. 42. So shall I have wherewith to answer] i.e. To stop an open mouth.
Verbal Apologies are sometimes necessary, but real always; we should by a
pious conversation put to silence the ignorance of foolish men, who like black
Moors despise beauty; like Dogs, bark at the shining of the Moon. We are also
to beg deliverance of God, for the confutation of such as say, we shall
never be delivered.

Verse. Ne auferas, id est ut spolium, ut Exodus 12.36 Aben-Ezra.
43. And take not the word of truth utterly] Give me free utterance, that in
nothing I be ashamed; but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ
may be magnified in my body, etc. Philip. 1.20. Despoyl me not of my courage in
a good cause, let not Satan rob me of that jewel. I have read of a Noble man,
who when he came into jearing company of great ones, would begin and own
himself one of those they called Puritans, and so prevented them.

Verse. 44. So shall I keep thy Law continually] If thou please to give me to
believe with the heart, and to confess with the mouth, I shall surely persevere
in the profession and practice of the truth.

Verse. 45. And I will walk at liberty] In the full latitude of thy
Commandments, and not by wilful wickedness ensnare, and ensnarl my self; as
those do who in the fullness of their sufficiency are in streights, and in
pursuit of their lusts do pierce themselves through with many sorrows. The
Italian senseth it, I will walk in peace of conscience.

Verse. 46. I will speak of thy testimonies, etc.] Nulle vel terrore vel
splendore mundano impeditus. Kings commonly abound with all things but only
Truth, as Alphonsus King of Arragon complained. David would deal plainly with
them though never so high; especially when he should come to be of equal level
with them, and so to have better opportunity.

Verse. Ethic. l. 10
47. And I will delight my self] sc. In contemplation of thy Word. Aristotle
tells us, that the principal pleasure is to be found in contemplation.

Verse. Utr^que manu ^apessam.
48. My hands also will I lift up, etc.] Removing all rubs, and pulling thy
Word to me with both hands earnestly, with my whole man, with my whole might;
(...), straining the body, and stretching out the hands to do mine utmost at
it, whilst others put it from them with a force, and so judge themselves
unworthy of everlasting life, Acts 13.46.

Verse. 49. Remember thy Word] God is not unrighteous to forget, Heb, 6.10. yet
we must as his remembrancers, Isa. 62.6. put his Promises in suit, Ezekiel. 36.37.

Upon which thou have caused me to hope] God gives us to do what he hiddeth us
to do, Ezekiel. 36.27.

Verse. 50. This is my comfort] The Promises yield strong consolation:
Philosophical comforts are of little force, as Plato acknowledges, In Axi^^
and Cicero bewaileth in his Epistle to Octavius.

For thy Word has quickened me] When I was at last cast, and drawing my last
breath, as it were.

Verse. 51. The proud have had me greatly in derision] Soo^^ing proceeds from
pride, Prove. 3.34. with 1 Pet. 5.5.

Yet have I not, etc.] They cannot flout me out of my zeal.

Verse. 52. I remembered thy judgments of old, O Lord] This was to have an holy
memory, well fraught with profitable matter, such as are examples of Gods
dealing with his people, and their enemies in all ages.

And was comforted] Some degree of comfort follows every good action; as heat
accompanies fire, as beams and influences issue from the Sun.

Verse. 53. Horror has taken hold upon me] Horripilatio, turbo, vortex, an
horrible tempest, Psalm. 11.6. such as surprised holy Habba^^uk, chap. 3.16.

Because of the wicked] To think of their heinous sins, and horrible
punishments, which they dread not, dream not of. See Dan. 4.19.

Verse. 54. Thy statutes have been my songs] Thy Promises which bind thee by
Grace, as statutes do us by Duty, and are every whit as sure. Metaphora a
falcibus.
By these I lopped off my cares, fears, and griefs, as with a pruning or paring
knife: spared them round till none was left.

In the house of my pilgrimage] In hoc exilio, in hoc ergastulo, in hac
peregrinatione, Bern.
in hac valle lachrymarum. Travellours sing to deceive the tediousness of the
way; so did David. and hereby he solaced himself under that horror, verse. 53.
great is the comfort that comes in by singing of Psalms with grace in our
hearts.

Verse. 55. I remembered thy name, etc.] breaking my sleep for the purpose, to
meditate on thine holy Attributes, Word, and Works.

And have kept thy Law] Which could not have been kept, if not kept in firm and
fresh memory. See 1 Cor. 15.2.

Verse. 56. This I had] This comfort, or this remembrance, or this ability to
keep thy Law.

Because I kept thy precepts] A strange reason, I kept it because I kept it;
but every new act of obedience fitteth for a following act, Romans 6.19. As in
Sin so in Grace, Mark 4.24. acts increase habits, and facilitate the work.

Verse. 57. Thou art my portion, Lord] Whiles other men's portion, Sunt divitia
vel deliciae, nothing short of God can satisfy me.

I have said, etc.] i.e. Purposed, and promised the obedience of faith.

Verse. 58. I have entreated thy favour] Heb. Thy face, that is, thy Christ,
says Ambrose and Hilary: this David did in the sense of his own utter
inability, to do as he had promised.

Be merciful unto me, etc.] This was the sum of his Petition, and must be the
main of ours.

Verse. 59. I thought on my ways] At Self-examination begins sound
conversion, Lam. 3.39, 40. Hag. 1.5, 7. 2 Cor. 13.5.

And turned my feet] Finding all to be naught, and stark naught, (contrary to
what God found in his works upon a review, all good, and very good) set upon a
new course.

Verse. 60. I made haste, and delayed not] Heb. I distracted not my self about
Had-I-wist, but minded the one thing necessary. Nalite tempus in nugis terrere:
vel cras, ut ille seria hodie morituri protelari, says one; Haste, haste,
haste delays are dangerous, opportunities are headlong, and once past
irrecoverable.

Verse. 61. The hands of the wicked have robbed me] In these late stripping
times, many a poor man's whole life's gettings were lost in an instant.

But I have not forgotten thy Law] I have encouraged my self in the Lord my
God, as at the sack of Ziglag, 1 Samuel 30.

Verse. 62. At midnight will I rise] To speak with a friend. The Primitive
Christians had their (...) and Cyprian: And this the (...) Night services.

Because of thy righteous judgements] Gods Word read, and Preached, is a main
matter of thankfulness: so are his Works.

Verse. 63. I am a companion of all them] Though never so mean, if there be
aliquid Christi in them: Grace is of an uniting properry, and purges out
partiality, Jam. 2.1, 2.

That keep thy precepts] The best proof of true fear of God, Psalm 103.13. Act.
10.35.

Verse. 64. The earth, O Lord is full of thy mercy] Thy mercy is over all thy
works: This is thy general goodness. ^ben-Ezra.
But

Teach me thy statutes] Non pet^ a te aliam misericordiam: this is that I beg
above all, viz. the lively light of thy Law and Word: sound and saving
knowledge. A gracious spirit cannot be satisfied with low things.

Verse. 65. Thou have dealt well with thy servant] Men must be no less
praisefull than prayerful. Shall we come to the well of life thirsty, and then
turn our backs upon the Rock that follows us?

According to thy word] sc. Of promise: this sweetteth a blessing.

Verse. 66. Teach me good Judgement] Heb. good taste, for the soul also has her
senses: and as the mouth tastes meat, so the ear tries words; the mind
relisheth Religion.

For I have believed thy Commandements] But would do yet more, 1 Job. 5.13.
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of
God, that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

Verse. 67. Before I was afflicted I went astray] Especially through high
mindedness, and earthly mindedness, which are purged out by affliction, and
grace increased; as Fish thrive better in cold, and salt waters, as the
Walnut-tree is most fruitful, when most beaten. Master Ascham was a good
Schoolmaster to Queen Elizabeth: but Affliction was a better, etc. See my
Treatise on Rev. 3.19.

But now I have kept thy word] Now that I have been lashed to it, and have paid
for my learning, Vexatio dat intellectum, Smart makes wit. As the scourging
and beating of the garment with a stick beats out the mothes and dust; so do
afflictions corruptions from the heart. Quae nocent, docent. Corrections of
instructions are the way of life. Prove. 6.

Verse. 68. Thou art good, and do good] Good in thy self (indeed there is
none good but thy self) and good to thy Creatures, inexpressibly, bounteous,
and beneficial.

Teach me thy statutes] And so impart unto me of thy special goodness, that I
may resemble thee in being and doing good: full of goodness, filled with all
knowledge, Romans 15.14.

Verse. 69. ^oncinna^unt ^tificlose con^^xe^unt.
The proud have forged a lie against mee] Heb. They have cunningly and finely
aspersed me, Mendacium mendacio assuentes, peecing one lie to another, and
drawing together iniquity with the cart-ropes of vanity.

But I will keep thy precepts] Notwithstanding their slanders; and the rather.

Verse. 70. Their heart is as fat as grease. Gross as grease, curdled as Milk
or Cheese, say the Septuagint, congealed and baked as it were in their sins:
Obtusum and quasi arnina obductum: fat things are less sensible, and
fat-hearted people are noted by Aristotle for dull and stupid.

But I delight in thy Law] Illa me pasco and sagino, therewith I feed and fat
my self.

Verse. 71. It is good for me that I have been afflicted And thereby humbled;
for else the fruit of affliction is lost, and they are always impaired, that
are not improved by their sufferings, as all Gods people are sure to be at
length. The Lac^demonians of old (and the same is said of the Hollanders a
late) grew rich by war, and were bettered when all other Kingdoms were undone
by it. The Saints make benefit of their crosses; which to others are
destructive.

That I might learn thy statutes] Luther says of some of Saint Paul's Epistles,
that they can never be understood, but by the cross. Qui (...) (says he in
another place) (...) do best understand the scriptures when the wealthy and
secure read them but as one of Ovids Poems.

Verse. 72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me, etc.] For what is all this
trash to that true treasure, those lively, and life giving oracles? Dionysius
worthily preferred Plato before Aristippus, because the one was ever craving
money of him: but the other books. It is reported of Plato, Joh. Manl. lec^ com.
78.
that for three choice books he gave thirty thousand silverlings or florens.
Now what were all his books to the Bible? To blame then was that Anabaptist who
said in Melancthous hearing, that he would not give two pence for all the
Bibles in the World.

Verse. 73 Thy hands have made and fashioned mee] Plasmaverunt: which Bazil
interprets of the body curiously wrought by God, Psalm. 139. as Made,
Formaverunt. Firmaverunt.
of the soul, q. d. Thou art my Maker, I would thou should be my Master. A
body have thou fitted me, Heb. 10.5. a reasonable soul also have thou given
me capable of salvation; I am an understanding creature still; neither have I
lost my passive capacity of thy renewing grace.

Give me understanding] And thereunto add sincere affection, v. 80. that
these may run parallel in my heart, and mutually trans^^se life, and vigor
into one another.

Verse. 74 They that fear thee will be glad, etc.] As hoping that they shall
also in like sort be delivered and advanced.

Because I have hoped in thy word] And have not been disappointed. The Vulgar
renders it super speravi, I have over-hoped: and Aben-Ezra glosseth, I have
hoped in all thy decree, even that of afflicting me, as in the next verse.

Verse. 75 I know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are right] That is, that I suffer
deservedly. To thee, O Lord belongs Righteousness, etc. Dan. 9.

And the thou in faithfulness have afflicted mee] That thou may be true to
my soul, and not suffer me to run on to my utter ruin; Or, in faithfulness;
that is, in measure, as 1 Cor. 10.13.

Verse. 76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindnesse] That I faint not, neither
sink under the heaviest burden of these light afflictions.

According to thy word to thy servant] To thy servants in general, and
therefore I trust to me, who am bold to thrust in among the rest, and to put
my name in the Writ.

Verse. 77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, etc.] He repeateth the same
thing in other words, and re-enforceth his request; showing that he could not
live without divine comforts.

For thy Law is my delight] Thou have my heart and good will; which shows
that I am thy workmanship in a spiritual sense also, Ephesians. 2.10. Oh look upon
the wounds of thine hands, and forget not the work of thine hands, as Queen
Elizabeth prayed.

Verse. 78 Let the proud be ashamed] Theodoret thinks that David here prays
not against, but for his enemies; quandoquidem confusio and ignominia salutem
procreat. But that is not likely.

For they dealt perversely with mee] Writhing my words and deeds to a wrong
sense: Or, they would pervert me.

But I will meditate in thy Precepts] Or, I will speak of them, and so stop
their mouths, and save my self from them.

Verse. 79 Let those that fear thee] These are fitly opposed to those proud
ones, as Mal. 3.13.16.

Turn unto mee] From whom they have shrunk in mine affliction.

And those that have known thy Testimonies] Deum cognoscere and colere, to know
and serve God is the whole duty of a man, says Lactantius.

Verse. 80 Let my heart be sound] For the main, though I have many failings.
Pray we against Hypocrisy.

That I be not ashamed] As all dissemblers once shall be.

Verse. 81 My soul faints for thy salvation] Saying as those good souls, Jer.
8.20. The Harvest is past, the Summer isended, and we are not saved.
Physicians let their patients blood sometimes etium ad (...) deliqui^m, till
they swoon again, Howbeit they have a care still to maintain nature; so does
God the fainting spirits of his people by cordialls, Isa. 57.16.

But I hope in thy Word] Vivere sp^ vidi qui moritur^ (...).

Verse. 82 Mine eyes said] God sometimes deferreth to help, till me^^have left
looking, Luke 18.8. when the son of man comes, shall he find faith? hardly.
This he does to commend his favors to us, and to set a price on them.

Saying, When will thou comfort mee] This is a Pros^popaia, as if David's eyes
said thus, whilst they earnestly expected comfort.

Verse. 83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke] Shrivelled, wrinkled,
withered, dried up, My body by long suffering is but a bag of bones, and that
black and sooty; confer Psalm. 32.3. and 102.3. My soul in danger of being
bereft of all spiritual moisture.

Yet d^ I not forget thy Statutes] Nay I do the rather remember them, and fetch
relief from them.

Verse. 84 How many are the days of thy Servant?] i.e. Mine evil days, Prove.
15.15. All the days of the afflicted are evil. See Psalm. 37.12. and these
soon seem many to us.

When will thou execute Judgment, etc.] This is the voice of those Martyrs,
Rev. 6. who are thereupon willed to have patience, till the number of their
Brethren is fulfilled.

Verse. 85 The proud have dug pits for mee] The pride, cruelty and craftiness
of wicked Persecutors, are fore-tokens of their utter destruction. The Greek
renders it, they have told me tales, Prove. 16.27. An ungodly man diggeth up
evil.

Which are not after thy Law] Neither they, nor their pits. But what care they
for thee or thy law? and shall they thus escape by iniquity, Psalm. 56.7?

Verse. 86. All thy Commandments are faithfull] Heb. Faithfullness, that is,
they are true, sure, equal, infallible.

They have persecuted me wrongfully] For asserting thy truths, and adhering
thereunto.

Help thou mee] The more eagerly men molest us, the more earnestly should we
implore the divine help.

Verse. 87 They had almost consumed me upon earth] In Heaven I shall be out of
their reach. But this is their hour, and the power of darkness, Luke 22.53.

But I forsook not thy Precepts] No trouble must pull us from the love of the
truth. You may pull my tongue out of my head, but not my faith out of my heart,
said that Martyr. The Saints choose affliction father than sin.

Verse. 88 Quicken me after thy loving kindnesse] David under long affliction
had his damps, and dulnesses: as the best faith, if long tried, will flag, and
hang the wing. He therefore rouseth up himself, and wrestleth with God for
quickening grace; which he promises to improve, and not to receive the grace
of God in vain, so shall I keep the Testimony of thy mouth.

Verse. 89 For ever O Lord thy word] It is eternal and perpetual, neither can
it be vacated or abolished by the injury of time or endeavors of tyrants.
The Bible was imprinted at the new Jerusalem by the finger of Jehovah, and
shall outlive the days of Heaven, run parallel with the life of God, with the
line of eternity. The Saints also and Angels in Heaven live by the same law as
we do here, and we pray to be conformed unto them.

Verse. 90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations] He singleth out Gods
word of promise, and shows it to be immutable and unmovable as the earth is
in the middle of Heaven, by the word of Gods power. See Jer. 33.25.

Thou have established] See Job 26.7. with the Note.

Verse. 91 They continue this day] God never brake promise with them, Jer.
33.20, 25. much less will he with his people, for whose use he made them.

For all are thy servants] All creatures are at Gods beck and check; except
evil Angels and men those great Heteroclites; who yet do Gods will though
against their own wills.

Verse. 92 (...) thy (...) had been my delight Unless it had been settled in my
heart (as well as it is in Heaven) for my singular comfort, I had been crushed.

I should (...) ((...) long (...)) have perished] The La^-grave of H^ss^n, told
me at (...) says (...) that it had been impossible for him to have born up
under the manifold miseries of so long an imprisonment, (...) verb divine in
sue cords, (...) of the Scrip^^es in his heart. Joh. Manl. loc. com. ^39.


Verse. 93 (...) That is thy promises which are a^ fire and firm as the commands
of the most absolute Monarch upon earth. And here the Prophet proposes his own
example for a pattern to others: for as Pacatus writes in his Panegyric to
Theodosius the Emperor, blandissime jubetur exemplo, exam^^^s are sweet
Precepts.

For with them thou have quickened mee] Thou have fetched me again, when ready
to faint, as verse. 92.

Verse. 94 I am thine, save mee] Every man will see to his own, unless he be
worse than an Infidel: and shall not God?

For I have sought thy Precepts] And can thereby prove my self to be Thine.
Where it is employed, that all that we are to seek in our obedience, are the
Precepts themselves; the thing especially we are to aim at, is obedience it
self to the Precepts.

Verse. 95 The wicked have waited] Nothing less than destruction will satisfy
Persecutors: but the Lord knows how to deliver his Peter's out of the hands of
Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews, Act. 12.11. 2
Pet. 2.9.

But I will consider thy Testimonies] And therewith hearten and harden my self
against their insolences, and attempts for my hurt.

Verse. 96 I have seen an end of all Perfection] viz. Here below. Tempora tacta
ruunt praetoria --

Fairest buildings, strongest persons, goodliest Empires have their times and
their turns; their rise and their ruin. Omnis finis finem vidi. Sir. Interp.
Omnia sunt hominum tenui pendentia filo;
Et subito casu quae valuere ruunt;
Omniae fortunae variis stant obvia telis:
Aut ^tiam longo tempore victa cadunt.


But thy Commandment is exceeding broad] It is endless, infinite perpetual,
and withal of largest extent; witness that of Charity which is the complement
of the Law, and the supplement of the Gospel. David, though he had proceeded
further in the discovery of divine truths than those before him, verse. 99. yet
he was still to seek of that which might be known: Like as those great
discoverers of the new found land, confess still a P^^^-u^tra.

Verse. 97 O how love I thy Law] Such a pang of love he felt, as could not
otherwise be vented but by a patheticall Exclamation: and this was wrought in
him by the thought of the largeness and lastingness of Gods law. Plato prized
one book (called Sophron) above all the rest, whereof he had many. Richard de
Bury Bish. of Durham, as he had more Books than all the Bishops of England
besides, so in his Book called Philobiblos, he says of himself, ecstatico
quodam librorum amore potenter se esse abreptum, that he was carried out of
himself by love to good books; Floruit anno. 1333.
but not so much as David was to Gods blessed book. Queen Elizabeth at her
Coronation received the Bible (presented unto her) with both her hands; and
kissing it, laid it to her breast, saying, that the same had ever been her
chiefest delight, etc. Speed.


It is my meditation all the day] Sive locutio, commentatio, occupatio, my
daily discourse, study, or employment; as love is never idle.

Verse. 98 Thou through thy Commandments have made me wiser than mine enemies]
So that I outwit them; and mine holy simplicity is too hard for their sinful
subtlety. Be wise as Serpents.

For they are ever with mee] Heb. It is ever with me, that is, every one of
thy Commandments; I am expert in them: Or, It is mine, I have made them mine
own by meditation; I have turned them in succum and sanguinem; I have
incorporated them, as it were into my soul.

Verse. 99 I have more understanding than all my teachers] i. e. I have
understood by much reading more than they ever taught me, whilst I referred
all to practice; and so came to know more of Gods mind than they did. A friend
says Chrysostom, that is acquainted with his friend, will get out the meaning
of a letter or phrast, which another could not that is a stranger: so it is in
the Scripture. Act. and Mon.
And here, Indocti (...) calum: a pious swain is better learned than a proud
Philosopher, faith a certain devout Dominican. Our King Alfred was held the
best in all his Kingdom, both for understanding and for (...) the holy
Scriptures.

For thy Testimonies are my meditation] I do particularly apply the word heard
to mine own necessities; and work it upon mine affections by an after
deliberate meditation.

Verse. 100 I understand more than the Ancients] Whom yet Age, Use, and
Experience have taught much but by the practical study of the Word I ou^-go
them all; with reference to these hoary heads, the seniours of the Synedri^^
be it spokens Non prelixa facit sapi^^^ ba^^.

Verse. 101 I have refrained my feet, etc.] I have clapped up my unruly affections
close prisoners, and hampered them: abandoning every error in Judgment, and
enormity in practice.

That I may keep thy word] Which I shall never do, but by self-denial and
mortification.

Verse. 102 I have not departed from thy judgements] i.e. From thy Law; which is
called Judgments, because God will thereby judge the World.

For thou have taught mee] scil. To cleave close unto thee with full purpose of
heart; and not to be drawn aside by any either Allurement, or Affrightment.

Verse. 103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste] Heb. To my Palate. Sir. ca^is
gutturis mei, the roof of the mouth resembles Heaven. Epicurus was worthily
blamed by Ennius for that ^um palat^ quid sit optimum judicabat, cali palatium
non suspexerit, whiles he looked so much to his palate, he looked not at all
to the heavenly palace. David was no Hog of his heard: he had sweet meats to
feed on, that the World was not aware of.

Yea sweeter than honey to my mouth] Mercuries Priests were wont to say when
they did eat their figs, (...), Truth is sweet. The Comaedian says, after
Solomon, (...), Light is sweet. The pleasures of the mind are far beyond those
of the body.

Verse. 104 Through thy Precepts I get understanding] Those are the Statutes of
Heaven, and as men by studying the Statute-book, get worldly wisdom; so they
may hereby get heavenly.

Therefore I hate every false way] Whether in point of opinion or practice. I
shall look upon Auxentius as a Devil, so long as he is an Arrian, says
Hilary. And I would shun an Heretic, as I would do a Devil, for he is sent on
his errand, says another.

Verse. 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet] Without the direction whereof both
for my whole course of life, and for every particular action thereof; I cannot
but be in dreadful darkness, and desperate downfalls.

Verse. 106 I have sworn, and I will perform it] A religious vow is nothing else
but a solemn promise, or rather oath made to God to use this or that means,
either to avoid some evil whereunto he finds himself inclined, or too be
set onwards in the performance of some duty, unto which he finds himself very
backward. Thus Neh. 10. Masora sepes legi, dec mae divitiis, vota sanctimoniae,
silentium sap^entiae. Pi^ke Aboth.
they take a new oath, and seal to it. Thus Job chap. 31.1. and Jacob, Genesis
28.21, 22. called therefore the Father of vows.

That I will keep thy Righteous Judgements] Keep them as I am able, and as thou
by thy grace shall enable me, Psalm, 119.32 Peter was too peremptory, Jephtha
too hasty.

Verse. 107 I am afflicted very much] Usque valde, extremely: If David be so
fully bent to obey God, he shall have troubles great store, 1 Timothy 3.12. All
that will live godly, and are set upon it, shall suffer persecution. Zeal for
Christ draws troubles to it self, as the wind Caecias does clouds.

Quicke^ me, O Lord, according to thy word] Help me to keep my promise, to
perform mine oath; notwithstanding these troubles growing upon me. A vow made
without prayer is never kept.

Verse. 108 Accept, I beseech thee, the free-will-offerings] My prayers and
praises; prayers for thine assistance, and praises for thine enablements, Psalm.
50.14. and 22.25.

And teach Judgments] This is a request that David has never done with.

Verse. 109 My (...) I am (...) nor afraid of death in this case: I make no more
of life than a child does of his bird which he carries in the palm of his
hand held open. See Judge. 12.3. Job 13.14

Yet do I not forget thy Law] Notwithstanding all these dangers; my I love it,
and like it so much the better, as those Psalm. 44. and Romans 8. and that holy
Martyr who caught up the Revelation cast into the same fire with himself, and
cried, O (...) Apocalypsis, etc.

Verse. 110 The wicked have laid a s^are for mee] Such, as rather than their
lives, would have had mine: such as sought and fain would have sucked my blood.

Yet I erred not from thy Precepts] I held the Kings highway; and leaped not
over the hedge to avoid a piece of foul way.

Verse. 111. Thy Testimonies have I taken as an heritage] (...) ali^nandi
patrimonii vice, A Patrimony that I prize, and will never part with; since I
hold it from thee as a child of thy grace.

For they are the rejoicing of mine heart] Other heritages have their troubles.
Qui habet terras, habet querras, says the Lawyer; but the just man's joy is
unmixed.

Verse. 112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy Statutes] This is the
fruit of my Christian contentation, and spiritual joy, I have inclined my
heart: Indeed thou Lord have done it, for thou art the only heart-maker, and
heart-mender; but thou countest and call it my doing, for mine encouragement
in thy service. Certum est nos facer^ quod facimus, sed Deus facit ut faciamus,
says Austin.

Always even to the end] For else I shall lose the things that I have wrought,
and not receive a full reward, 2. Job. 8.

Verse. 113 I hate vain thoughts] Which though they may swarm in my head, shall
never lodge in my heart, Jer. 4, 14. for there I have entertained a better
guest.

Thy Law do I love] All hatred proceeds from love, and is (...), against the
whole kind, as Aristotle speaks; True love to Gods law enrageth the hearts of
Gods people, with an holy hatred of heresies, and perverse devises.

Verse. 114. Thou art my hiding place and my shield] To defend me from deadly
darts and dangers. See Psalm. 18.2 and 32.7. God either preserves his from
common calamities; or from the hurt of them.

I hope in thy word] And am content to stay thy time. He that believes,
makes not hasle.

Verse. 115 Depart from me, ye evill-doers] For why? there is no doing my duty
in your company; besides a double danger, 1 Infection of sin. 2 Inflection of
punishment, Rev. 18.4.

For I will keep the Commandements] Which it booteth me not to set about,
unless I do first abandon your society, hating the garment spotted by the
flesh, that is, avoiding evil company (says Mr. Perkins) that R^mora or Pest
of true piety. See Levit. 15.4.

Verse. 116 Uphold me according to thy word] The promise is the souls support.
Turn we the palm, and not the backside of the hand to this staff, leaning upon
it, praying hard for the accomplishment of it; and then be content though we
can say but as that holy man Mr. Paul Bain did; I thank God in Christ,
sustentation I have; Bains Letter^
but s^avities spiritual I taste not any.

And let me not be ashamed of my hope] Let me not be defeated,
disappointed, frustrated. This, David knew he should not be (for Spe^ in
terrenis incerti (...); spes in divinis nomen est certissimi, Heb 11.1 Romans
5.5.) but yet think fit to seek it by prayer, as Eliah foretold abundance of
rain, but yet went up to the top of Carmel, and prayed for it, 1 King. 18.41,
4^.

Verse. 117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe] No longer are we safe from
sin and punishment, than God puts under his hand: we subsist merely by his
manutension: and if he withdraw his grace never so little, we are down on all
four, as we say.

And I will have respect, (...)] Saints shall persevere because they are kept
by the power of God through faith (...) salvation.

Verse. 118. Thou have trodden (...), etc.] Thou, (...) King o^ Conqueror, have
made use of them for a (...) King of Persia did (...) the Roman Emperor, and
as T^merl^^ did B^j^z^^.

For their deceit is falshood] They think themselves to be out of the reach of
thy rod; but they will find it somewhat otherwise.

Verse. 119 Thou put away all the wicked of the earth like dross] Consuming
them in the fire of thy wrath, and casting them out as refuse. See Isa. 1.25.
vel quo^irubi^^^ existimasti, Kimchi.
thou have reckoned them as rust; whereas the Saints are preciously esteemed,
as the least filings of gold are.

Therefore I love thy Testimonies] Quia purgant a scoriis hypocris^os, and in^
(...) est ut foris: because they take out the precious from the vile, and make
men the same within as without.

Verse. 120 My flesh trembleth] Horripilatur, Job 4.15. In the Saints is a
mixture of contrary passions, fear and great joy: as was in those holy women,
Mat. 28.8. and the one makes way for the other.

Verse. 121 I have done Judgment and Justice] I have lived in all good
conscience before God until this day, Act. 23.1. my cause is right, and my
carriage righteous. But Innocence is no target against detraction, and deadly
practice; therefore

Leave me not to mine oppressours] Or traducers; for they will soon exceed
their commission, Zach. 1.15.

Verse. 122 Be surety for thy servant for good] Obi vadimonium; appear for me,
and nonsuit all accusations against me: Or, undertake for me that I shall
keep thy laws, as I have said and sworn to do: Sis fide jussor meus. Some
observe that this is the only verse throughout the whole Psalm wherein the word
is not mentioned under the name of Law, Judgments, Statutes, or the like
terms. And they make this Note upon it; where the Law fails, there Christ is
a surety of a better Testament. There are that render the words thus. Dulcify
or delight thy servant in good, Oblects servum tu^m. ^uscul.
that is, make him joyful and comfortable in the pursuit and practice of that
which is good.

Verse. 123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation] Not my bodily eyes only, but the
eyes of my faith. See verse. 81.82.

And for the word of thy Righteousness] That is, for thy faithful promises,
which many times bear a long date.

Verse. 124. Deal with thy servant according to thy mercy] i.e. Show me so much
mercy as to teach me thy Statutes, Cathedram in caelis habet qui corda d^cet.
Divine learning is of Gods free favor. If common skill, then this much more
comes forth from the Lord of H^asts, who is wonderful in counsel, and
excellent in working, Isa. 28.19.

Verse. 125 I am thy servant, give me understanding] I have voluntarily hired
my self unto thee, chosen the things that please thee, and take hold of the
Covenant, loving to be thy servant, Isa. 56.4, 6. Now this is all the wages I
crave of thee, Give me understanding, etc. This David speaks, says one, in
a real and heavenly complement with his Maker.

That I may know thy Testimonies] Work done in the dark must be undone again;
David therefore would fully know his Masters mind that he might acceptably do
it.

Verse. 126 It is time for thee Lord to work] For else what will become of thy
great name, and of thy poor people? This the Psalmist speaks not, as
prescribing God a time, but as in minding him of his own glory, and of his
peoples necessity.

For they have made void thy Law] They would if they could; as out Antinomians
dogmaticall and practical; our aweless lawless Belialists, untameable,
untractable.

Verse. 127 Therefore I love thy Commandements] I like them the better, because
they slight them; and prize that way the more that they persecute. I kindle my
self from their coldness, and whilst they greedily grasp after gold, and fine
gold, I lay hold upon eternal life, 1 Timothy 6.10, 11, 12.

Verse. 128 Therefore I esteem all thy Precepts concerning all things to ^ee
right] Therefore from the same ground again as before by an holy Antip^ristasis.

I esteem, etc] Recti^icavi, I have declared them to be right in every part
and point, against those that wrangle and wr^st them to a wrong sense. I esteem
every parcel of Truth precious: and arm an utter enemy to every Heto^odoxie.
The many Alls in this verse used (not unlike that in (...) chap. ^4.30.)
shows the integrity and ^^^^ersality of his obedience. All is (...) word, but
of large extent.

I hate every false way] Whether in point of opinion or practice; all sinful
deviations and prevarications. Hatred is ever against the whole kind of a
thing, Rhet. lib. 2.
says Aristotle.

Verse. 129 Thy Testimonies are wonderfull] As comprehending high and hidden
mysteries, such as are far above the reach of humane reason; such as the very
Angels admire and adore. A man must have more than common faith to subject his
reason to them. But all men are Socinians by nature; they will believe Gods
word no further than they can see reason: which while men make the rule of
their faith (as did the wise Grecians, the rational Romans) they stumble at
the preaching of the Cross as foolishness; and dis-beleeve the riches of
Christ, which are unsearchable.

Therefore does my soul keep them] Though I cannot comprehend them, yet I am
comprehended by them: and though I cannon do them as I would; yet I am doing at
them as I can. I admire what I cannot attain to.

Verse. 130 The entrance of they Words gives light] So soon as men are over the
threshold of thy house, sese lux quaedam in^u^rrabilis conspiciendam offert, a
mavelous light shines about them So little cause is there that any should
accuse Gods word of darkness and hardness; or give way to negligence and
carelessness of the Scriptures, because they are wonderful. Lex, Lux, the Law
is a Light, Prove. 6.23. and the Gospel a great Light, Mat. 4.16. See 2 Pet.
1.19.

It gives under standing to the simple] And makes them subtle, Prove. 1.4. so
they be but docible. The very first rud^ments of religion make wise the rude,
so they be not refractary.

Verse. 131 I opened my mouth and panted] Heb. And S^^ped in the air, as one
that labors for life. Oh the sighs and the groans that I uncessantly
breathed forth, As one that ^unneth himself out of breath. Sitio propter l^gem
sicut d^acones proptet pluviam. Job. 29.
out of zeal to thy law! Oh the strong affections kindled on the harth of my
heart! for

I longed for thy Commandements] The Septuagint render it by (...), which
signifies a most vehement desire, impatient of delays.

Verse. 132 Look thou upon me, etc.] Face about toward me, and give me a
glimpse at least of thy grace; for full fruition I expect not in this present
life. Brevis hora, parva mora.

As thou usest to do unto those, etc.] Common mercies satisfy not a Saint; he
must have peculiar favors, spiritual blessings in heavenly things, even the
sure mercies of David. He pleads for a child's part.

Verse. 133 Order my steps in thy word] Let me walk as in a ^^ame, walk by rule
exactly, accurately, Ephesians. 5.15. Here he prays that he may keep the
affirmative Precepts, says Aben. Ezra: as in the next words, the negative.

And let not any iniquity have dominion over mee] Let it not reign, though it
does rebel: let it be like those beasts in Daniel, whose dominion was taken
away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time, chap. 7.12.

Verse. 134 Deliver me from the oppression of man] Homo homin^ lupus. David
besides his corruptions within, met with oppressions and persecutions without:
so shall all that will live godly in Christ Jesus: set them never dream of a
dilicacy in religion.

So will I keep thy Precepts] Not say as those Miscreants, Jer. 7.10. we are
delivered to do all these abominations: but as good old Zachary, Luke 1.74, 75.
servati sumus ut serviam^^, we are delivered that we might serve God without
fear, etc.

Verse. 135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant] David could not live out of
Gods favor, nor without his direction; he therefore here and elsewhere
prays heartily for both.

Verse. 136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes] My countenance is clouded, and
even furrowed with continual tears shed for thy dishonor: therefore lift up
upon me the light of thy loving countenance. It grieveth me greatly to see
thy law violated, and the transgressors thereof so careless of their own
eternal good. This was L^t^ case at Sodom, 2 Pet. 2. and is many a good man's
still; every profane wretch being a Hazael to his eyes, an Hadadri^^^^ to his
heart. The Septuagint and Vulgar read, Mine eyes have drawn down issues of
Waters; ( i.e. they have wept abundantly) because they (that is, those eyes of
mine) have not kept thy Law. So Aben-Ezra: Quia ipsi (...) non observassant
(...). David had walked after the sight of his eyes, and the lust of his heart;
this is now his grief. Thus they; but not so well.

Verse. 137 Rightea^^ ar^ th^^ O Lord] Essentially, and efficiently.

And upright are thy Judgements] Which are sometimes secret, but always just,
as the Emperor Mauricius also acknowledged, when his wife and children were
slain before his eyes by the traitor Phocas.

Verse. 138 Thy Testimonies which thou have commanded] i.e. the Gospel, as Isa.
8.20. And the Commandment thereof to hear Christ, Mat. 17.5. and to believe in
his name, 1 John 3.23. this is a faithful and true saying, 1 Timothy 1.15. not
Avengelaion, as the Jews blasphemously call it, or fabula de Christo, as that
black mouthed Pope.

Verse. 139 My zeal has consumed mee] Has meagred and impaired me much. In
the Hebrew, the last letter is doubled, to increase the signification.. Zeal is
the extreme heat of all the affections.

Verse. 140 Thy Word is very pure] And calls for purity. Hence wicked men
slight it: but Saints the rather embrace it, desirous to be conformed to the
heavenly pattern.

Verse. 141 I am small and despised] Minutus, a worm and no man, an abject and
outcast, nullificamen hominis, etc.

Ye^ do I not forget thy Precepts] My mean condition impaireth not my constancy.

Verse. 142 Thy Righteousness is an everlasting righteousness] When all other
laws and sentences, though engraven in brass or marble, shall decay and
determine; thy Law lasts for ever; and so shall they that observe it.

And thy Law is the Truth] And therefore lasting. (...), says Plat^. The
Eternity of Israel cannot lie, 1 Samuel 15.29.

Verse. 143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold of mee] Heb. Have found me.
Those (as we say of foul weather) come before they are sent for; yet are they
not without the Lord. It is he that puts his under the black-rod.

Yet thy Commandments, etc.] God and his Word are never so sweet to the
Saints, as in adversity.

Verse. 144 The Righteousness of thy Testimonies, etc.] This is the same with
verse. 142.

Give me understanding, etc.] An ignorant life is a lifeless life. Fuit non
vixit. The life of God is the only life. But from this, men are alienated by
the ignorance that is in them Ephesians. 4.18.

Verse. 145 I cried with my whole heart] This shows that he had not only a
gift of prayer, but a spirit of prayer.

Verse. 146 I cried unto thee, save mee] Salvation properly denotes the
privative part of man's felicity, but includes the positive part also; this
must be got by prayer.

Verse. 147 I prevented the dawning of the morning] I was up and at it before
daybreak. This is check to our sluggishness.

I hoped in thy Word] The Word furnished his hope, and his hope his prayer.

Verse. Hier. ad Eusta.
148 Mine eyes prevent the night-watches] By this verse and the former it
appears that he spent whole nights in prayer and meditation of Gods Word.
Hierom counseled some godly women thus, Tenenti codicem somnus obrepat, and
cadentem faciem pagina sacra suscipiat.

Verse. 149 Hear my voice according to thy loving kindnesse] Showed heretofore
to others of thy servants, and to me frequently.

Quicken me according to thy Judgement] i.e. According to thy promise.

Verse. 150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief] Those scelerum
assidui-sectatores prompti sunt ac parati.

They are far from thy law] And so have nothing to restrain their rage; since
they have cast thy cords from them.

Verse. 151 Thou art near, O Lord] To counterwork and control the enemy; as
also to safeguard and support thy people.

Verse. 152 Concerning thy Testimonies, etc.] the sempiternity of Gods Word, is
an excellent prop to faith, and help in prayer; to those especially who are of
long experience, and have well laid up their experiments. David had learned
this truth of a child little. See 2 Timothy 3. ult.

Verse. 153 Consider mine affliction and deliver mee] Vide commis^ratio^es
oculis, look upon it, and let thine eye affect thy heart: say as once, I have
seen, I have seen the affliction of my people.

Verse. 154 Plead my cause and deliver mee] Litiga litigium meum. Be both mine
Advocate, and my Redeemer.

Verse. 155. Salvation is far from the wicked] How can it be otherwise? when as
God is neither in their heads, Psalm. 10.4. not hearts, Psalm. 14.1. nor words,
Psalm. 12.4. not ways, Tit. 1.16. can these have part or portion in his
salvation?

For thy seek not] This contempt of Gods Word is a plain proof, that no part or
piece of Gods favor belongs to them.

Verse. 156 Great are thy tender mercies, etc.] Or, many and Mother-like. This
is great comfort to great est sinners.

Verse. 157 Many are my Persecutours] Truth never wanted an adversary; and goes
seldom without a scratcht face.

Yet do I not decline] But still adhere to thy word; when others fall off as
fast, as leaves fall from trees in Autumn.

Verse. 158 I beheld the Transgressors and was grieved] Or, I abhorred them, or
I contended with them; not so much because they were mine, as thine enemies.

Because they kept not thy Word] Which all men are bound not only to observe,
but to preserve as much as may be.

Verse. 159 Consider how I love thy Precepts] And love facilitateth duty,
helping us over all the hardship of holiness. It yields also much boldness
to a man to offer it to God, as here, for a proof of his sincerity.

Verse. 160 Thy Word is true from the beginning] Heb. The beginning of thy Word
is true: Primarium illud est in verbo tuo quod est firmissimum, this is a
special praise of thy Word, that it is very sure. These words are faithful
and true, Rev. 22.6. from the one end of the Bible to the other. Some render it
thus, Thy most excellent Word is Truth. This most excellent word Kimchi
interprets to be particularly that in the head or preface to the Decalogue.
Hear O Israel, Jehova thy God, Jehova is One. Theodoret will have it to be that
promise made to Abraham that in his seed all Nations of the earth should be
blessed. Some read it, every chapter of thy Word is Truth.

Verse. 161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause] And Quae venit indigne
poena, dolenda venit.

But better without a cause, than for evil doing, 1 Pet. 4. David suffered by
these Potentates, because he was small and despised. verse. 141. as a little
dog is worried by the bigger, as the lesser fishes are devoured by the greater.

But my heart stands in awe of thy Word] The fear of God drives out the fear
of the creature, Isa. 8.12, 13.

Verse. 162 I rejoice at thy Word] Libenter omnibus omnes opes concesserim etc.
Epist. lib. 9.
I would gladly leave all the wealth in the World to others, said Tully, so
that I might without disturbance live and dye in the study of learning. What
marvel then that David was so taken with heavenly learning?

As one that finds great spoil] Which as it comes often unexpectedly (and is
therefore the better welcome) so the profit is usually very great (as was at
the sack of Constantinople and the pleasure (besides the honor) is no less
than the profit, because gotten from an enemy. George Fransperg (a General in
the Imperial Army, H^st of the Counc. of Trent. p. 43^
under the conduct of Charles Burbon, that sacked Rome in the time of Pope
Clement the seventh) caused an halter to be carried near his colors, saying
that with that he would hang the Pope, the better to encourage his soldiers
who were almost all Lutherans, whom he promised to lead to Rome; showing them
the great opportunity they had to enrich themselves with the spoils of that
City.

Verse. 163 I hate and abhor lying] Utitur atr^ci verbo, abominatus sum, I hate
it as I hate hell it self; and yet lying was David's sin after a special
manner, See verse. 29. with the Note.

But thy Law do I love] All hatred comes from love of they contrary. Ye that
love the Lord hate evil Psalm. 97.10.

Verse. 164 Seven times a day do I praise thee] Septies, id est, s^pissime, very
often in the day: whenever God sets me up an Altar, I am ready with my
sacrifice. Mahometans pray constantly five times a day; those of Morocco six
times. Papists foolishly and superstitiously allege this text for their seven
Canonical hours, as they call them. The Jews pronounce an hundred
benedictions ever day. Leo Modena.


Verse. 165 Great peace have they which love thy Law] The fruit of Righteousness
shall be peace, Isa. 32.17. even the peace of God, the joy of faith, a
heaped-up happiness.

And nothing shall offend them] Heb. They shall have no stumbling block: non
pereunt, quicquid accidat; Though they fall, they shall arise; for the Lord
puts under his hand, Psalm. 37.

Verse. 166 Lord, I have hoped for thy salvation] This saying he borrowed from
good old Jacob, Genesis 49.18.

And done thy Commandements] Done them as I could; done them to divine
acceptance through Christ; and hence I have hoped, 1 Job 3.3. Every man that
has this hope in him purifieth himself, as God is pure.

Verse. 167 My soul has kept thy Testimonies] scil. As well as mortality will
afford.

And I love them exceedingly] I delight in the Law of God after the inward man,
Romans 7.22. I trust I have a good conscience in all things, willing to live
honestly, Heb. 13.18.

Verse. 168 I have kept thy Precepts] All thy Laws are in my sight; like as all
my ways are in thy sight. I desire to approve my self to thee in the discharge
of every part and point of my duty; in all my ways I acknowledge thee. Pro
3.6. Here note, that all along this 21 Octonarie, the Psalmist propounds
himself for a Pattern of piety,

Verse. 169 Let my cry come near before thee, O Lord] That is, as some will have
it, Let this whole preceding Psalm, and all the petitions (whereof we have
here a repetition) therein contained, be highly accepted in Heaven.

Verse. 170 Let my supplication, etc.] The same again; neither is this
Battologie, but fervency in begging audience.

Verse. Semper, and (...)
171 My lips shall utter praise] Eructabunt labia mea hymnum. A Metaphor either
from a fountain casting out waters; vel a ructu qui cibum copiosum sequitur.

Verse. 172 My Tongue shall speak] True goodness is diffusive; charity is no
churl.

Verse. 173 Let thy hand help mee] To do what I have promised.

For I have chosen thy Precepts] Refusing Satan's cut throat kindness.

Verse. 174. I have longed for thy Salvation] So do all men; but then David will
take a right course for it (so will not all.)

And thy Law is my delight] This, the most men mind not.

Verse. 175 Let thy Judgments help mee] scil. To Heaven: together with Gods
Word, there goes forth a power.

Verse 176 I have gone astray, etc.] And of my self shall never return.

Seek thy Servant] Do all the offices of a good Shepherd for me, Luke 15.

For I do not forget] The root of the matter is still in me, I am recallable,
and ready to hear thy voice, Job. 10.3.

PSALM. CXX.
A Song of degrees] A most excellent Song. Tremellius renders it; and so
indeed this and the fourteen following are, both for the matter, and for the
form or manner of expression which is wondrous short and sweet, as the very
Epigrammes of the Holy Ghost himself, wherein each verse may well stand for an
oracle. And in this sense, Adam Hammahalah, or a man of degrees is put for an
eminent or excellent man, 1 Chronicles. 17.17. Others understand it otherwise;
wherein they have good leave to abound in their own sense; since sine pericul^
hic erratur, an error here is not dangerous.

Verse. 1 In my distress I cried unto the Lord] Oration (...) est, ut avis si^^
alis, Distress adds wings to our devotions. Our Savior being in an agony
prayed more earnestly Luke 22.44. So do all his members, and especially when
they ly^ under the lash of a lying tongue, as here verse. 2. Being defamed we
pray, says Paul, 1. Cor; 4.15.

And (...)] The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much,
Jam. 5.16. Z^ch. 13.9. He that prays ardently, speedeth assuredly, Psalm
91.15. and the unmiscarrying return of prayer should be carefully observed,
and thankfully improved, Psalm. 66. ult.

Verse. 2. Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips] This was David's distress,
and it lay heavy upon his spirit; so it did upon Jobs and Jeremies, chap.
20.10. the scourge of tongues he felt as sharp as Scorpions. Of the mischief
of an evil tongue, See James 3. and Psalm. 52. and Psalm. 12.3. with the Notes.

Verse. 3 What shall he given unto thee, etc] That is (as Austin senseth it)
what remedy is there for thee? q. d. None at all. Contra sycophantarum morfum
non est remedium, says Seneca. But others better, what gain gettest thou? what
profit make thou of thy lying and slandering? Hurt thou may another, but
not help thy self. Thou art not like the Maid whom Avic^^ speaks of, who
feeding her self with poison, was her self healthy, yet infected others with
her venomous breath: But rather like the traitor of whom Augustus said, I like
the treason, but hate the traitor. The slander is often applauded, when the
slanderer is abhorred.

Or what shall be done unto thee?] Heb. Added; Nihil prater plagas duriss^^^
a^, as verse. 4.

Thou false tongue] This he seems to say to D^^g, who is here called a false
fellow, and a Liar, though he spoke but the truth against the Lord Priests,
because not for any love to the Truth, nor for respect to Justice, nor for the
bettering either of Saul, or the Priests, but only to prejudice these, and to
incense the other.

Verse. 4 Sharp Arrows of the mighty] Arrows sharp, and shot with a force. A
false tongue is likened to a sharp razour, Psalm. 52.4. to a sharp sword, Psalm.
57.5. to sharp arrows, Prove. 25.18. here it has sharp for sharp; as God loves
to retaliate; and he is the Giant, or mighty one here, that shoots these
sharpest sha^ts, that inflicteth most exquisite punishments on such; as once on
Dives, whose tongue smoaked for it, Quia lingua plus peccaverat, as says a
Father, because he had so offended with his tongue.

With coals of Juniper] Which being a ^at kind of wood of gummy or salty
matter, Flamma redardescit quae modo nulla ^^it. Theophrast. Plin.
makes a very scorching fire, and quick coals, such as last long (some say a
month and more) and smell sweet; loc upon these coals will God broyl lying
lips, and a deceitful tongue, pleasing himself and others in that execution.

Verse. 5. Woe is ^e that I sojourn in Mesech] that is, in Muscovi^ say some, in
Hetruria say others, in Cappadocia rather, Mag^gs Country, Ezekiel 38. any where
out of the bosom of the true Church, or (as some sense it) in the Church, but
among Israelites worse than any Israelites o^ Pagans.

That dwell in the (...) of K^dar] With C^darens or Sa^ac^^, as they were
afterward called. Among these, David was in danger, Ne cum lupi^ (...), tande^
and ipse (...). Guilt, or grief, a good man is sure to get by being in bad
company, which makes him cry, O that I had the wings of a Dove, etc. or if
that Oh will not set him at liberty, then he takes up this, Wa^ is me, to
express his misery. Pi^ v^re est (...), and si dici (...), vitiis alienis
tribulari, (...) says Austin, It is hard and happy not to comply with ill
company.

Verse. 6. My soul has long dwelt with him that hates peace] With Saul, that
implacable tyrant, and with other (...). The very society of such (oe they

Deathbed, and (...) the wicked, for thou (...)

Verse. 7 I am for (...) But it is not peace, but pa^^y, that many men mind,
(...)

But when I speak, they are for Warre] They cry the alarm, being (...) like
they live in the fire of contention, Scorpion-like, that are always putting
forth the sting. Their spirits lie like that haven, Act. 27.12. (...)
South-west and North-west, two opposite points: neither will they be otherwise,
but the more they are sought to, the worse they are. This is the guise of
graceless persons.

PSALM. CXXI.
A Song of degrees] Or, of ascensions, in singing whereof there should be
ascensions in our hearts, See Psalm. 120.1.

Verse. 1. I will life up (...) unto the hills] Not to your (...) Psalm. 11.1.
human helps, and carnal combinations, Jer. 3.23. much less to those mountains,
In quibus gentes idela sua cell^^^, wherein the Heathens set and serve their
Idols, Deuteronomy. 12.2. but to Sion and M^riah, where Gods Sanctuary is, Psalm. 87.1.
or rather to heaven, Psalm. 18.8. with 2 Samuel 22.8. where God himself is: and so
it follows.

Verse. 2. My help comes from the Lord] To whom therefore alone I must look for
help. Bodin. theat. Naturae. 413.
Sursu^ corda, sursu^ etiam capita. Nauralists tell us, that of those twenty
eight Muscles whereby the head is moved, twelve lift up the head behind, and
two only before let it downward; to teach us to contemplate Heaven more, and
Earth less. Columb. de re (...) l. 5. c 9.
Others advertise us, that it is one main end why God has set in man's eye a
fifth Muscle; whereas other Creatures have but four: one to turn downward,
another to hold forwards, a third to turn the eye to the right hand, a fourth
to the left hand; but no unreasonable Creature can turn the eye upward, as Man
can; that he may look up to God.

Which made heaven and earth] And will rather unmake both again, than his
people shall want seasonable help.

Verse. 3. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved] Not greatly moved, Psalm.
62.2. an utter pr^lapsion.

He that keeps thee will not s^umber] And if King Philip could say, that he
could sleep securely because his friend Antipater watched by him: may not we be
much more confident, who have God to keep us?

Verse. 4. Behold, he that keeps etc.] He repeateth that sweetest promise
(that we may roll it as sugar under our tongues, that we may suck, and be
satisfied, Isa, 66.11.) and sets it forth with a Behold, q. d. mark it, and
kn^w than it for thy (...) Job. 5.27.

Shall neither s^umber nor (...)] Shall not fetch one win^^ of sleep. (...),
we slumber before we sleep; but God shall do neither. His seven eyes ( Z^ch.
3.9.) a^^ever open, yea they (...) and (...) through the whole earth, Zech.
4.10. scil. (...) Howbeit, he looks with special care and complacency on
the godly, Isa. 66.2.

Verse. (...) Phil. 4.7.
5 The Lord is thy (...)] His peace within thee and his po^e^ without thee
shall safeguard thee to his heavenly Kingdom.

The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand] To (...) and shield thee from all
annoyances, as the pillar of cloud did the Israeli^^s in the wilderness: as
the (...) that Paris overmatcht by Me^^la^ in a duel, (...) in a cloud and
carried off.

Verse. 6 The (...)] So choice and (...) is God of his children, that (...) or
pinching cold by (...) and all (...) of the (...) the Moon (as the (...) day,
nor the Moon by (...) Pope, and (...)

Verse. 7. (...) punishment; from the hurt, it not form the smart thereof.

He shall preserve thy soul] Which is often untoucht, when the body is in
durance. A sick servant of Christ being asked how he did? answered, my body is
sick, my soul is well.

Verse. 8 The Lord shall preserve thy going one, etc.] Thou shall have his safe
(...) public faith for thy defense, in (...) enterprises (...) and (...)
together with good success in all thine affairs and actions, Prove. 3.6.

PSALM. CXXII.
Verse. 1 I was glad when they (...)] The flourish is the chief joy of the good
Christian. Hence the Evangelicall among the Protestant party. Gregory Nazianzon
writes that his Father being an Heathen, and often besought by his wife to
become a Christian, had this verse suggested unto him in a dream, and was much
wrought upon thereby. (...) Dutch Martyr in Lu^^^ing, hearing the sentence of
his condemnation to the fire, Act. and Mon. fol. 807.
(...) Psalm, etc.

Let us go into the house of the Lord] I will go also, (as Zech. 8.21.) said
holy David; who was much a cheered at his peoples forwardness in Gods service,
and became their Captain.

Verse. 2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates] Where the Ark (whil^om
transportative) was now fixed: this was their great joy, so should it be ours,
that the true religion is now settled amongst us, and that we are at a
certainty. Respons. ad Staphyl.
Time was when good Melancthon groaned out, Qu^s fugiamus, habemus; qu^s
sequamur non intelligimus, We know whom we should fly, ( viz. the Papists)
but whom to follow we yet know not.

Verse. 3. Jerusalem is builded as a City, etc.] None such for uniformity of
buildings, or unanimity of Citizens. There is no such ^^^nesse in all the
World, as amongst true Christians; and this the very Heathens observed, and
commended. As the curtains of the Tabernacle were joined by loops; so were they
by love. And as they stones of they Temple were so close cemented together that
they seemed to be all but one stone, so was it among the primitive Saints.

Verse. 4. Whither the Tribes go up] Thrice a year all the Males appeared before
the Lord in Sion; the females also as many (...) would (as (...) the Virgin
Mary etc.) but they were not bound. At which times there was such a general
meeting, as no City could show the like a type of that great Panegyri^, Heb.
12.22, 23.

Unto the Testimony of Israel] The Ark was so called, in regard of the Tables
of the Covenant kept therein, as two letters of contract betwixt God and men,
says A^en-Ezra. Exodus 25.16. those two tables are called the Testimony.

Verse 5. For there are (...)] These are the two chief praises of any place. 1
The exercise or Gods sincere service. 2 The administration, and execution of
public justice.

Verse. 6. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem] Peace is a voluminous mercy, and
must therefore be prayed for, peace both of conscience and of Country. It is
well with Bees, when they make a noise in the Ha^^ but with men when they are
at quiet in Church and state. Among the Persian^ her that offered Sacrifice
prayed not only for himself, but for all his Country men and especially for the
King, Herodot lib. 1


They shall (...) that love (...) And out of love, pity and p^ay for thee.

Verse. 7. Peace be wit^ (...) had no sooner admonished others of their duty,
but himself (...).

Verse 8. For my Brethren and companions sakes] David was not all for himself
(as the ma^^^^ is in th^s^ (...) spirit, he did

(...)

PSALM. CXXIII.
Unto thee life I up mine eyes] Praying by them rather than by words, mine
afflictions having swollen my heart too big for my mouth. See the (...) Psalm.
121.1.

Verse. 2. Behold as the eyes of servants] For direction, defense, maintenance,
mercy in time of correction, help when the service is over-hard, etc. so do our
eyes wait upon the Lord our God, viz. for direction, and benediction.

Verse. 3. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, have mercy] This is prece^ fundere, calum
tundere, misericerdiem exterquert, as Tertulli^n has it: to wring mercy out of
Gods holy hands, by out utmost importunity.

For we are exceedingly filled with contempt] We are made the very sc^^ and
scorn of our proud imperious enemies. This the nature of man is very impatient
of, and can hardly brook: for there is none so mean but holds himself worthy
of some regard; and a reproachful scorn shows an utter dis-respect, which
issues from the very superfluity of malice.

Verse. 4. Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorn of those that are at
ease] And there-hence insolent, and unsufferable, (...), fullness breeds
forgetfulness, yea it makes men scornful, and wrongful to others.

PSALM. CXXIV.
Verse. 1. If it had not been the Lord, etc.] God may far better say than our
Hen. 8, Cui adhare^, praest. He whose part I take is sure to prevail. But
Christ has ever been the Churches Champion, and hence she is insuperable. The
Captain of the Lords H^asts is Captain of our salvation, Josh. 5.14. Heb. 2.10.

Verse. 2. When men rose] Monsters rather but such as think themselves the only
men alive; and us, the only slaves and Zanies.

Verse. 3. Then had they swallowed in up quick] As the great Fish do the little
ones, as hungry Lions, Gualth praef. in Marc. R. Obad. Gaon in Psalm. 124.
or Wolves, raven up their prey. Pt^l^mam Lathurus King of Egypt slew thirty
thousand Jews, and compelled the living to seed upon the dead. Adrian the
Emperor made a Decree, that he who had not slain a Jew, should himself be
slain.

When their wrath was kindled against us] Heb. in the flagrancies, or (...) of
their anger.

Verse. 4. Then the waters (...) us] At once the red Sea did the Egyptians, or
as the general deluge did the old world.

The stream (...)] Neither could we have withstood it, by any Art or industry.

Verse. 5. Then the proud waters, etc. The same again, to note the greatness
both of the danger, and of the deliverance. And it may teach us, not lightly to
pass over Gods great blessings, but to make the most of them.

Verse. 6. Blessed be the Lord, etc.] (...), thanks be to God was much in
Austins mouth, and should be (...) deliverance. How was God blessed (...).

As a prey to the (...)] Who meant to have made (...) and had already devoured
us in their hopes, but God (...) them.

Verse. 7. Our soul is (...), etc.] (...) Gods opportunity. See (...).

The (...), etc.] God (...) net is broken.

Verse. 8. (...)

(...) of infinite might and mercy; and say as those good souls at Ebon-ezra,
Hitherto God has helped us: he has, and therefore he will, etc.

PSALM. CXXV.
Verse. 1 They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount. Zion] Great is the
stability of a believers felicity. Winds and storms move not a Mountain; an
Earthquake may, but not easily, remove it. That mystical Mount Sion the
Church, immota manet, is unmovable; so is every member thereof, for the main
of his happiness.

Verse. 2 As the Mountains are round about Jerusalem] That is, lay some, as the
Angels; but we take it literally; Jerusalem was surrounded with many high
Mountains, which were a great safeguard to it; yet did not always defend it,
as the Lord does his, by being a wall of fire round about them, Zech. 2.5.

Verse. 3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest] Fall upon the lot of the
Righteous it may, notwithstanding that former promise of Gods protection; but
he will take care they be not tempted above that they are able, 1 Cor. 10.
he sets the time, and appoints the measure, Psalm. 30.5. Rev. 2.10.

Lest the Righteous, etc.] Overcome by impatiency, or drawn aside by the Worlds
either Allurements or Affrightments should yield and comply, or seek to help
themselves out of trouble by sinister practice. God (says Chry^ostom) does
like a Lutanist, who will not let the strings of his Lute be too slack, lest
it mar the music, nor suffer them to be too hard stretched or scrued up,
lest they break.

Verse. 4 Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good] But afflicted by those men
of thy hand, Psalm. 17.14. who are the rod in thine hand, Isa. 10.5. Do good in
thy good ple^sure (for nothing can be claimed by the very best) to such,
according to thy promise, verse. 3. which here I put in suit for them; Let the
Lord be with the good, 2 Chronicles. 19 11.

And to them that are upright in their hearts] For such only are good indeed,
and approved in Christ, as was Appelles, Romans 16 and Nathaniel, Joh. 1.
notwithstanding their infirmities. Hypocrisy imbaseth the purest metal, turns
gold into rusty Iron; sincerity does the contrary by a divine kind of Alchymy.

Verse. 5 As for such as turn aside by their crooked wayes] In lubricitates vel
tortuositates, such as pretend piety to their wordly and wicked designs and
dealings; dissemblers, warpers, versuti and vafri, who would cousen God of
Heaven if they could tell how.

The Lord shall lead them forth] Quantumvis reluctantes, as cattle led to the
slaughter; or malefactors to execution. Transfug as arboribus suspendunt, they
hand up fugitives, says Tacitus, concerning the Germans; there is martial law
for such, Heb. 10.38, 39. as there is for skellums amongst us.

With the workers of iniquity] They shall to Hell with the rest of the wicked
crew, notwithstanding their professions and pretenses of piety, whereunto they
are perfect strangers; Hypocrites are the freeholders of Hell; and other evil
persons are, as it were, Tenants to them; shall have their part with them, Mat.
24.51.

But peace shall be upon Israel] Peace shall be upon them and mercy, Gal.
6.16. The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither
shall a deceitful Tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie
down, and none shall make them afraid, Zeph. 3.12.

PSALM. CXXVI.
Verse. 1 When the Lord turned again] viz; From Babylon; and therefore that
which some translations have in the title, A Psalm of David (which is not in
the Hebrew) would be left out; for it seems to have been penned by Ezra, or
some Prophet of his time.

We were like them that dream] Tanta fuit liberationis (...) abilitas, so
admirable was the deliverace, that we could hardly believe it; as fearing the
certainty, and yet hoping the truth. Such a passion was upon Peter, when
enlarged by the Angel, Act. 12. upon the Grecians, when set free by Flaminius,
the Roman General; Majus gaudium fuit, says the Historian, quam quod
universum homines caperent, etc. their joy was too big for their hearts, they
scarce believed their own ears, when the Crier proclaimed their liberty, Lib.
33. Cyp. Epist. lib. 1. Aug. Confess. lib. 6. cap. 12. Gosr. in vit. Bernard.
but bad him say over that sweet word Liberty again; they also looked upon one
another with wonderment, velut somnii vanam speciem, says Livy. And such an
ecstasy is the new convert in as was Cyprian, Austin, Bernard; witness their
own writings.

Verse. 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter] We laughed amain, and
shrilled or shouted aloud, when we found that it was (...), as Plato speaks,
not a dream, but a done thing, which, (before) we held optabile potius quam
opinabile, incredible altogether.

Then said they among the Heathen] They who were wont to jear us, Psalm. 137.3.
God can soon alter the case of his afflicted people. See Esth. 8.17. with the
Note.

The Lord has done great things for them] Magnifica. So, Vere magnus est Deus
Christianorum, the God of the Christians is a great God indeed, said Calocerius
an Heathen, observing his works done for his people.

Verse. 3 The Lord has done great things] q. d. It Is a shame then for us not to
say so, much more; and, by an holy avarice, to take the praises out of their
mouths, who are no sharers in it, but spectators only. Let the Redeemed of the
Lord say so, speaking good of his name.

Verse. 4 Turn again our captivity, O Lord] Perfect what thou have so happily
begun for us.

As the streams in the South] i.e. Miraculously say some; as if thou should
cause rivers to run in dry and desert places: Or comfortably, as if thou
should refresh such hot parts with plenty of water. Or suddenly. The South
is a dry Country where are few springs, but often land-floods, caused by the
showers of Heaven. The Jews at this day pray for a speedy rebuilding of their
Temple. They cry altogether, Templum tuum brevi valde cito, valde cito, in
diebus nostris citissime nunc aedifica, Templum tuum brevi, Bux^. de Syn^g.
Jud. cap. 13.
that is, build thy Temple quickly, very quickly, in our days, etc. should not
we be as earnest for the mystical Temple, etc?

Verse. 5 They that sow in tears] Whether Ministers (as some restrain the sense)
who serve the Lord with many ^ears and temptations, Act. 20.19. but see little
fruit: Or others, who sow in the tears of affliction, and compunction for sin
the cause thereof; his faecunda sine dubio messis indulgentiae orietur, says
Arnobius, these shall certainly teap in joy, pardon of sin, Isa. 1.16. power
against it (these troubled waters cure the soul, as the tears of Vine-branches
cure the leprosy) increase of grace; the Lilly is sown in her own tears, says
Pliny, so is grace; the Olive is most fruitful when it most distilleth; so
here: These April-showres bring on May-flowers, and make the heart to be like
a watered Garden: Besides an access of glory; for they that weep with men shall
laugh with Angels; their tears shall be turned into triumphs, their sadness
into gladness, their sighing into singing, their musing into music, etc. See
Mat. 5.4. This, the Protomartyr foresaw, and therefore Ibat ovans animis, and
spe sua damna levabat. ^embus de St. Stephano.


Verse. 6 He that goes forth and weepeth, etc.] Heb. He that going goes,
etc. which Luther interprets of temptations continued, and mutually
succeeding one another; taking their turns upon a poor soul.

And weepeth] Going and weeping, and asking the way to Zion, with their faces
thither-ward, Jer. 50.4, 5. Some faces appear most orientally beautiful, when
most instampt with sorrow.

Bearing precious seed] Such as are hope and faith in the truth of Gods
promises. Some render it seed of acquisition, Cam^strum Leo ^ud^ Bucer.
such as the poor seeds-man has got, prece and precio, by praying and paying
dear for it. Some, bearing a Seed-basket, or seedlop.

Shall doubtless come again with rejoycing] Only he must have patience, Jam.
5.7.

Bringing his sheaves with him] Or, Act. and Mon.
after some, their handfulls, even gripes of gladnes^, as Philpet the Martyr
renders it. Then shall Abraham the good Mower, says Another, bind us up into
sheaves as pure corn* and fill his bosom full with us; carrying us into the
Lords barn, to make a joyful Harvest in Heaven.

PSALM. CXXVII.
A Song of degrees for Solomon] As Psalm. 72.1. Penned by David not long before
his death; and left his Son Solomon, to teach him, that nothing can be gotten
(or kept, no not Children be gotten) but by Gods blessing. This last was a fit
lesson for Solomon, who by so many wives and Concubines, left but one only son
that we read of, and him none of the wisest. Some render it. A Song of degrees
of Solomon, Lib. 3. (...) Cap. 1.
making him the penman of it; yea Origin from this inscription, entitleth
Solomon to all the Songs of degrees; but that is not likely.

Verse. 1 Except the Lord build the house] Not the Fabric only, but the family
and the Government thereof; there is no good to be done, if God set not to his
F^at, (...) Naz.
and say, Let it be done; if he blast, or not bless men's endeavors and
policies, they are all but arena sine calce, sand without lime, they will not
hang together, but like untempered Mortar, fall asunder. There is a curse upon
such as Idolize themselves, and kiss their own hands, though they be
industrious, Johoaki^ for instances, Jer. 22.

Except the Lord keep the City, the watchman] Whether civil, or military:
frustra nititur, qui Deo non innititur. Politicians stand on their own heads
(like Children) and shake their heels against Heaven, but all in vain.
Soldiers, some of them are ready to say with Ajax, I acknowledge no God but my
sword, etc. Such shall be surely befooled and confuted; and Gods blessing
declared to be all in all.

Verse. 2 It is vain for you to rise up early] Di^^culantes surgere, tardantes
sedere, to toil and moil in the World. It were to be wished, that this Nisi,
nisi, frustra, frustra, were ever sounding in the ears of worldings, who will
needs act upon their own principles; God is not in all their thoughts.

To eat the bread of sorrows] i.e. Hardly gotten, or that men can scarce beteem
themselves, they are so miserable and parsimonious; or bread eaten with
carefullnesse, as Ezekiel. 12.19. certainly men may sooner by their care add a
furlong to their sorrow, than a cubit to their comfort.

For so he gives his beloved sleep] Dilecto suo, to each of his beloved ones;
not without an allusion to Solomon's other name, Jedid^ah, Gods darling. To
these he gives sleep, extraordinary quiet, refreshing sleep ((...) with an
Aleph quiescent, which is not usual) that is, he gives wealth without
labor, as to others labor without wealth, says Kimchi, the world comes
tumbling in upon them, as we say, they have it quasi per somnium (as Towns
were said to come into Timoth^us his toiles whiles he slept) without anxiety,
they break not their sleep for the matter, Plut. Omnia necessaria benignissime
Dominus quasi per jocum largitur. Beza.
but live by faith, and make a good living of it too.

Verse. 3 Lo^ children are an heritage of the Lord] This Solomon could not but
be sensible of. See the title of this Psalm; especially if by children are
meant good children, as Prove. 18.22. by a Wife is meant a good wife. And here
the poor man that has no inheritance otherwise, has one from the Lord; for
such are often full of children; neither may he wish, as one graceless man did,
that God would keep such his blessings to himself, for he had too many of them.

Is his reward] That is, his free gift; and God will be their exceeding great
reward, if by their Parents prayer and good education, they prove towardly, as
the Lords heritage, and as arrows in the hand, etc.

Verse. 4 As Arrows are in the hand of a mighty man] Heb. Of a Giant, who
she^teth them with a courage, and is cunning at it. As clean and well-kept
arrows. (...) similitude imports, that Children must have more in them than
nature; for arrows are not atrrows by growth, but by art: so they must be such
Children, the knottiness of whose nature is refined and reformed, and made,
smooth by grace: and then they are cared for. As, if they prove otherwise, they
are a singular heart break to their poor Parents, who are seen to sit under
Elias his Juniper, wishing for death, and saying with Moses, Numb. 11.14 15. I
am not able to bear all this sore affliction; because it is too heavy for me.
And if thou deal thus with me, kill me I pray thee, out of hand, if I have
found favor in thy light, and let me not see my w^e chedness.

So are children of the youth] Or, young sons, or ^^ds, springlings,
striplings, vegetous and vigorous, able to be a guard to their aged Parents
against the children of violence, who seek to press in upon them at the door,
as the Sodomites dealt by righteous Lot, (see verse 5.) besides the service
they may do to the Commonwealth (as did the Horatii, and Curatii) by their
impetus h^roici, valor and virtue.

Verse. 5 Happy is the man that has his quiver] That is, his house full of
them, so they be good children: for else to be childless is a mercy, it is
(...), a blessed misery, says Euripedes; and Aristotle concludes that (...)
is no blessing, unless it be (...), that is, to have a numerous issue, unless
they be virtuous.

They shall not be ashamed] Neither Father nor Children: se enim illi mutuo
muniunt ac firmant, they help each other.

But they shall speak with their enemies] Periment, says Tremellius, they
shall foil them, and non-sute them.

PSALM. CXXVIII.
Verse. 1 Blessed is every one that fears the Lord] This Psalm is fitly
subjoyned to the former, and it is, (...), a kind of wedding-sermon, written
for the instruction and comfort of married couples, and showing that Conjugium
humanae est divina Academia vitae. And it is to be observed, that here all men
are spoken to as wedded; because this is the ordinary estate of most people.
See 1 Cor. 7.1, 2. At this day, every Jew is bound to marry about eighteen
years of age or before twenty; else he is accounted as one that lives in sin;
and how the Popish clergy, professing continency, have turned all places into
so many Sodoms, who knows not?

And walks in his wayes] The true reverentiall fear of God will easily form
the heart to a right obedience. They that fear the Lord will keep his Covenant,
Psalm. 103.13. with 18. and therefore was the Law delivered at first in that
terrible manner.

Verse. 2 For thou shall eat the labor of thy hands] That is, thou shall reap
and receive the sweet of thy sweat; whether it be of the brow, or of the
brain, according to the kind of thy calling. Isa. 57.10.
And although thou be forced to, live by the labor of thine hands (whence
man's life is called the life of his hands) yet that shall be no hinderance to
thy happiness, but a furtherance of thine account.

Happy shall thou be, and O shall be (...) with thee] The Chaldee thus
expounds it, Happy thou in this World; and good shall it be unto thee in the
World to come.

Verse. 3 Thy Wife shall be as a fruitful vine] Full of bunches and clusters
of rich ripe Grapes; so she, of Children, and those virtuous; the little-ones
hanging on her breasts, as Grapes on the Vine; the Elder as Olive-plants,
straight, green, fresh and flourishing, Psalm. 52.9. legitimate also; as the
Olive admits no other grass. Indeed the Olive set into the Vine yields
both Grapes and Olives; whereby is represented the natural affection that is
betwixt the Mother and her Children. The Vine and the Olive are two of the best
fruits; the one for chearing the heart, the other for clearing the face, Psalm.
104.15. the one for sweetness, the other for fatness, Judge. 9.13. both together
implying, Simon Bi^^is^ (...).
that a great part of a man's temporal happiness consists in having a good
Wife and Children. It is said of Sylla, that he had been happy had he never
been so married: And Augustus his wish was (but all too late) Utinam a^t
caelebs vixissem, a^t orbus periissem, Oh that I had either lived single, or
dyed childless. (...).


By the sides of thy house] Where Vines are usually planted, that they may have
the benefit of the Sun. The modest wife is domiporta, found at home, as Sarah
in the Tent; not so the Harlot, Prove. 7.12.

Thy Children like Olive-plants] See the Note before on this verse.

Round about thy Table] Making a most delectable enclosure.

Verse. 4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed, etc.] Behold, and that
thou; q. d. Know it for a truth, and rest assured of the blessedness of
married couples, whatsoever the Devil and his Agents (speaking basely of
marriage) suggest to the contrary, so be it they fear the Lord, for that is it
that sweeteneth, and sanctifies all estates of life whatsoever.

Verse. 5 The Lord shall (...) thee out of Zion] viz. With spiritual
benedictions, Ephesians. 1.3. and these are far better than all other that Heaven
and Earth afford, Psalm. 134.3.

And thou shall see the good of Jerusalem] i. e. The prosperity of the Church;
without which all other comforts are to a good soul, but as so many Ichabods: A
good Christian injoyeth them not, but is even sick at heart of the afflictions
of Joseph. Amos 6.6.

Verse. 6 Yea thou shall see thy Childrens Children] A faithful man shall
abound with blessings, Prove. 28.20. he shall have all that heart can wish, or
need require.

And peace upon Israel] Procured in part by thy piety and prayers.

PSALM. CXXIX.
Verse. 1 Many a time] Or, Much, and long.

Have they] i. e. The Persecutors that deserve not a name. The rich man is not
named (as Lazarus is) because not worthy. They shall be written in the Earth,
Luke 10.
Jer. 17.13.

Afflicted mee] i. e. The whole community of Saints; spoken of here in the
singular, for their 1 Unity, 2 Paucity.

From my youth] The first that ever dyed, dyed for religion; so early came
Martyrdom into the World.

May Israel now say] Who yet are promised peace, Psalm. 128.6. but so was
Josiah; and yet he dyed in battle, 2 Chronicles. 34.28. But the very God of peace
had sanctified him throughout, and so altered the property of his affliction,
that it was subservient to his salvation.

Verse. 2 Many a time, etc.] Anadiplosis ad exaggerationem, q. d. They have done
it and done it again, but could never atchieve their design, viz. to supplant
and eradicate me; which might not be. Oppugnarunt ( non expugn^^unt, however
the Vulgar so renders here.) The Church is invincible. Athens took upon her of
old to be so; and Venice late boasts the like: but time has confuted the
one, and may soon do the other; when the Church shall stand firm, because
founded on a Rock. More truly may it be said of it, than it was once of Troy,
Victa tamen vinces, eversaq, Tr^ja resurges: Obruet hostiles illa ruina domes.
Ovid de (...).


Verse. 3 The plowers plowed upon my back] Which was never without some Cross
upon it, yea some plough passing over it. The Church is Gods Husbandry; and he
will be sure to plow his several, what ever becomes of the wild waste. She
is his threshing-flore, Isa. 21.10. and has but little rest or respite.
Enemies are flails to thresh off our husks, files to brighten our graces;
ploughs and harrows, without which we should bear but a very thin crop. Gods
people do (...), sow the seed of prayer in the long furrows which those plowers
made on their backs; like as the Jews in their feasts break their glasses, as
Jerusalem was broken.

They made long their furrows] Heb. Furrow; as if there were totum pro (...)
corpus. Here happily the Psalmist alludeth to those exquisite torments whereunto
many of the Martyrs were put, sulcati fidiculi^.

Verse. 4 The Lord is righteous] That Is a ruled case, and must be held for a
certain truth, whatever we are, or our Persecutors.

He has cut asunder the cords of the wicked] That is, their harness, their
ploughtraces ( nam continuatur tropus Rusticus) so that the plough is loose,
and the horses at liberty; all their forces and designs are broken.

Verse. 5 Let them all be consounded, etc.] And if those that hate Zion, how
much more those that hurt her with their virulent tongues, or violent hands?

Verse. 6 Let them be at the grass, etc.] They are cursed with a witness whom
the Holy Ghost thus curses, in such emphaticall manner, in such exquisite
terms.

Verse. 7 Wherewith the Mower fills not his hand] As holding it not worth
gathering in. Wicked men are useless creatures: as Stratonicus in Athenau^
says, that the Hill Hamus was for eight months in the year very cold, and for
the other four it was Winter.

Verse. 8 Neither do they which go by say, etc.] As they use to do to harvest
men, Ruth 2. 3 John
Christianity is no enemy to courtesy; yet in some cases, says not, God speed.

PSALM. CXXX.
Verse. 1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee] i. e. Ex portis ipsis
desperationis, from the very bosom and bottom of despair, caused through
deepest sense of sin and fear of wrath. One deep calls to another, the depth
of misery to the depth of mercy. Basil and Beza interpret it, Ex intimis
cordis penetralibus, from the bottom of my heart, with all earnestness and
humility. He that is in the low pits and caves of the earth, sees the stars
in the firmament; so he who is most low and lowly, sees most of God, and is
in best case to call upon him. As spices smell best, when beaten: and as
frankincense maxim fragrat cum flagrat, is most odoriferous, when cast into
the fire: so do Gods afflicted pray best, when at the greatest under, Isa.
19.22. and 26.16. and 27.6. Luther when he was buffeted by the Devil at
Coburgh, and in great affliction, Joh. Man^. loc. com. 43.
said to those about him, Venite, in contemptum diaboli Psalmum, de profundis,
quatuor vocibus cantemus, come let us sing that Psalm, Out of the depths, etc.
in derision of the Devil. And surely this Psalm is a treasury of great comfort
to all in distress (reckoned therefore of old amongst the seven Penitenti^^)
and is therefore sacrilegiously by the Papists taken away from the living, and
applied only to the dead; for no other reason, I think, says Beza, but because
it begins with Out of the Depths have I cried; a poor ground for Purgatory,
or for praying for the souls that are there, as Bellarmine makes it.

Verse. 2 Lord hear my voice.] Precum exauditie identidem est precanda. Audience
must be begged again and again; and if he once prepare our heart, it is sure
that he will cause his ear to hear, Psalm. 10.17. as when we bid our Children
ask this or that of us, it is because we mean to give it them.

Verse. 3 If thou, Lord, should mark iniquities] This and the next verse
contains, says one, the sum of all the Scriptures. Twice he here names the
Lord, as desirous to take hold of him with both his hands. Extremity of Justice
he depre^^^h, he would not be dealt with in rigor and rage. Extrema,
fateor, commeritus sum, Deus; Quid enim aliud dixers? It is confessed I have
deserved the extremity of thy fury; but yet let me talk with thee (as Jer.
12.1) or reason the case.

O Lord, who shall stand?] Stand in Judgment, as Psalm. 1.5. and not fall under
the weight of thy just wrath, which burns as low as Hell it self? How can any
one escape the damnation of Hell, which is the just hire of the least sin, Romans
6.23. and the best man's life is fuller of sins than the Firmament is o^ stars,
or the furnace of sparks? Hence that of an Ancient, V^ homiu^^ vit^, quantumvis
laudabili, si, re^^ miscericordi^, judicetur. Woe to the best man alive, should
he be strictly dealt withal: Surely if his faults were but written in his
forehead, it would make him pull (...) hat over his eyes.

Verse. 4 But there is forgiveness with thee] This holds head above water, that
we have to do with a forgiving God, Neb. 9.31. none like him for that, Mic.
7.18. For he does it naturally, Exodus 34.6. abundantly, Isa. 55.7. constantly,
as here; there is (still is) forgiveness and propitiation with God; so Job.
1.27. the Lamb of God does take away the sins of the World; it is a perpetual
act, and should be as a perpetual picture in our hearts.

That thou may be feared] i. e. Sought unto, and served. It is a speech
like that, Psalm. 65.2. O thou that hear prayer, unto thee shall all flesh
come. If there were not forgiveness with God, no man would worship him from his
heart, but fly from his as from a Tyrant. But a promise of pardon from a
faithful God makes men to put themselves into the hands of justice, in hope
of mercy. Mr. Perkins expounds the words thus, In mercy thou pardonest the
sins of some, that thou might have some on earth to worship thee.

Verse. 5 I wait for the Lord] I wait, and wait, viz. for deliverance out of
misery, verse. 1. being assured of pardoning mercy. Feri, Domine, feri; a
peccatis enim absolut^^ (...), said Luther, strike, Lord, while thou will, so
long as my sins are forgive^ I can be of good comfort; I can wait, or want for
a need.

And (...)] viz. Of promise, that ground of hope unfailable, Romans 5.5. of (...)
unfeig^^ed, 1 Timothy 1.5.

Verse. 6 My soul waits for the Lord] Or, Watches for the Lord, Heb My soul
to the Lord, an eclipticall concise speech, importing strong affection, as does
also the following reduplication, Prae custodibus ad mane, prae custodibus ad
man^.

I say more than they] Or, More than they that watch for the morning, wait for
the morning; wherein they may sleep, which by night they might not do.

Verse. 7 Let Israel hope in the Lord] Hope and yet fear, as verse. 4. (with a
filial fear) fear, and yet hope.

Plenteous Redemption] Are our sins great? with God there is mercy, matchless
mercy. Are our sins many? with God is plenteous redemption, multa redempti^;
he will multiply pardons, as we multiply sins, Isa. 55.7.

Verse. 8 And he shall redeem Israel] By the value and virtue of Christ's death,
by his merit and spirit, 1 Cor. 6.11.

PSALM. CXXXI.
Verse. 1 Lord, my heart is not haughty] Though anointed and appointed by thee
to the Kingdom; yet I have not ambitiously aspired unto it, by seeking Souls
death, as his pick thanks persuaded him; nor do I now being possessed of it,
proudly domineer (as is the manner of most Potentates) and tyrannize over my
poor subjects; but with all modesty and humility (not minding high things) I do
condescend to them of low estate, Romans 12.16. Now, Bucholc.
in alto positum non altum sapere, difficile est, and omnino inusitatum; sed
quanto inusitatius, tanto gloriosius. It is both hard and happy not to be
puffed up with prosperity and preferment, Vespasian is said to have been the
only one that was made better by being made Emperor.

Nor mine eyes lofty] Pride sits and shows it self in the eyes as soon as
in any part. Ut speculum oculus est artis, ita oculus est naturae speculum.

Neither do I exercise my self in great matters] Heb. I walk not; manes intra
metas, I keep within my circle, within the compass of my calling; not troubling
my self and others by my ambitious projects and practices, as Cle^n did,
Alchibiades, Caesar Borgia, and others Ambitionists.

Or in things too high for mee] Heb. Wonderful; high and hidden things, that
pass nay apprehension, and which it behooves me, mirari p^tius quam rimari, to
admire rather than to pry into, Arcana Dei sunt Arca Dei. The Bethshemites
paid dear for peeping into the Ark. Phaeton is feigned by the Poets to have
perished by taking upon him to rule the chariot of the Sun and Bellerophon, by
seeking to fly up to Heaven upon his Pegasus, to see what Jupiter did there.
Terret ambustus Phaeton avaras
Spes: and exemplum grave praebet ales
Pegasus, terrenum equitem grava^us
Belleroph^ntem. Horat. lib. 4. Od. 11.



Verse. 2 Surely I have behaved] Heb. If I have not, etc. a deep asseveration,
Si non comp^sui and sedavi.
such as has the force of an oath.

And quieted my self] Heb. Stilled or made silent my soul; chiding it when
distempered or noisefull, as the Mother does her weanling.

As a child that is weaned of his Mother] Who neither thinks great things of
himself, nor seeks great things for himself but is lowly and fellowly, Mat.
18.1. innocent, and ignoscent, taking what his Mother gives him, and resting
in her love.

My soul is even as a weaned child] Who will not be drawn to such again,
though never so fair and full-strutting a breast: So nor David, the worlds dugs.

Verse. 3 Let Israel hope] See Psalm. 130.7.

PSALM. CXXXII.
Verse. 1 Lord, Remember David] Origin holds Solomon to have been penman of
all these Songs of degrees, as has been before noted. But as that is not
^^^^ly (see the titles of Psalm. 122. and 124. and 131.) so diverse interpreters
conceive this (...) be his; because much of it is the same with that prayer
he made at the dedication of the Temple, 2 Chronicles. 6.16, 41, 42. Here then he
prays God to remember David, that is (not his merits and suffrages, as the
Monks would have it, but) the promises made unto him (for the which Solomon
praised God as well as for the performance to himself, 2 Chronicles. 6.10.) and his
singular solicitude about the house and worship of God, Ita ut do^mire non
potuit. Kimchi.
which was so great, as that it affected, yea afflicted his spirit; whence it
follows here, and all his afflictions; for which it is, 2 Chronicles. 6.42. the
mercies or kindness of David.

Verse. 2. How he swear unto the Lord] Out of the abundance of his affection, 1 Chronicles. 29.3. See Psalm. 119.106. he solemnly took God to witness: and this he
did, say the Rabbines, at that time when he saw the punishing Angel, and was
terrified.

And vowed to the mighty God of Jacob] Jacob is mentioned, say the Hebrews,
Quia primo vovit, Kimchi. Aben-Ezra.
because he first vowed to God, Genesis 28.20. whence he is called, Pater votorum,
the Father of vows.

Verse. 3. Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house] i. e. Of my
New-built house, 1 Chro. 15.1. 2 Samuel 1.2. Those in Malachi were not so
well-minded, chap. 1.4.

Verse. 4. I will not give sleep to mine eyes] viz. With any good content; or,
more than needs must.

Verse. 5. Until I find out a place for the Lord] The Jew-Doctors tell us, that
as the earth is in the middle of the world, so is Judea in the middle of the
earth, Jerusalem in the middle of Judea, the Temple in the middle of Jerusalem,
and the Ark in the middle of the Temple.

An habitation] Heb. Habitations: happily because the Temple consisted of three
parts, or partitions.

Verse. 6. Lo we heard of it at Ephratae] At Bethlehem Ephrata, David's
Birthplace, there we heard of it long since by our Progenitors. Of it, that
is, or the Ark, says Chrysostom; Dicit ^am in famine. i. e. divinam
praesentiam. R. Arama.
of Gods resting place, says Austin; of the place where Christ should be born,
says Hierom; where the Temple should be set, says Aben-Ezra: where the
Sbechinah, or divine presence should reside, say other Rabbines.

We found it in the fields of the wood] At Jerusalem, say some; or at
Kiriath^earim, as others will have it. The Chaldee interprets it of the wood
of Libanus, the place, says he, where the Patriarchs worshipped.

Verse. 7. We will go into his Tabernacles] We will cheerfully and unanimously
frequent his public worships, in the place he has pitched upon (called, his
gates, and his Courts, Psalm. 100.4.) saying, as verse. 8, 9, 10. (...), follow
God, was the old rule among the very Heathens.

We will worship at his footstool] i.e. At his Ark, where he uttered Oracles,
and wrought miracles, etc. which yet was but his footstool, to lift his people
heavenward, Christ-ward, who was the truth of that type, the Ark, the
Mercyseat.

Verse. 8. Arise O Lord into thy rest] The place of thy rest: for the Ark was
transportative, till settled in Solomon's Temple: so, till we come to Heaven, we
are in continual motion.

Thou and the Ark of thy strength] The Ark in the Temple was the chiefest
evidence of Gods presence, and the most principal type of Christ, in whom the
fulnese of the Godhead dwells bodily. The word is Aron, which is put for a
Coffin, Coffer, or Chest, Genesis 50.20. 2 King. 12.9. This shows, that all the
Counsels of God, all the love and favor of God, all that God accounts
precious, are treasured up in Christ, Col. 2.3. and 1.13 Isa. 42.1. Heb. 10.12.

Verse. 9. Let thy Priests be clothed with righteousness] i. e. With Salvation,
as verse. 16. No surer sign of Gods gracious presence with a people, than a
powerful Ministry, clothed with inward purity and holiness, represented by
the holy Garments.

And let thy Saints shout for joy] i. e. Those that are converted by such a
Ministry; let those that are justified by faith have peace with God, and joy
unspeakable, full of glory.

Verse. 10. For thy servant David's sake] For thy Covenants sake made with him,
and for thy Christ's sake, who is often called David, as Hos. 3. ult. so for the
Lords sake, Dan. 9.17.

Turn not away the face of thine anointed] Of thy Christ: defer not his coming,
or deny not my request, as 1 King. 2.16, 17, 20.

Verse. 11. The Lord has sworn in truth] The Eternity of Israel cannot lie, 1 Samuel 15.29. yet tendering our infirmity, he swears and seals to us.

Of the fruit of thy body] David was excellent at making the utmost of a
Promise, at pressing, and oppressing it, till he had expressed the sweetness out
of it, Isa. 66.11. See how he improveth Gods Promise, and works upon it, 1 Chronicles. 17.23, 24, 25, 26. Solomon had learned to do the like.

Verse. 12 If thy Children will keep my Covenant] Although Gods Covenant is
free, yet is it delivered under certain conditions on our part to be observed;
which are as an Oar in a Boat, or Stern in a Ship, turning it this way or that,
etc.

For ever more] For a long season and Christ, for all eternity.

Verse. 13 For the Lord has chosen Zion] He chose it for his love; and loved
it for his choice.

Verse. 14 This is my rest for ever] It was so because God was pleased to make
it so; he rested in his love; he would seek no further, Zeph. 3.17.

For I have desired it] This alone made the difference, as it a so did betwixt
Aarons rod, and the rest that were laid with it.

Verse. 15 I will abundantly bless her provision] Her stock and her store;
Vi^tico ejus affatim benedicam. T^em.
so that she shall not want necessaries, which yet she shall hunt for (that
is, labor for) as the Hebrew word imports; and know how she comes by;
therefore it is added

I will satisfy her poor with bread] Dainties I will not promise them; a
sufficiency but not a superfluity: poor they may be, but not destitute bread
they shall have, and of that, Gods plenty, as they say; enough to bring them to
their Fathers house, where is bread enough. Let not therefore the poor
Israelite fear to bring his offerings, or to disfurnish himself for Gods
worship, etc.

Verse. 16 I will also cloth her Priests, etc.] So that they shall save
themselves and those that hear them, 1 Timothy 4.16 Thus God answers his peoples
prayers both for temporalls and spiritualls: See verse. 9. and that with an
overplus of comfort; they shall shout aloud.

Verse. 17 There will make the horn of David to bud] A metaphor from those
living creatures, quorum ramosa sunt cornua which have snags in their heads (as
Deer have) which are unto them in stead of boughs. For horn, some read beam of
David, confer Luke 1.78.

I have ordained a Lamp] i. e. A successor ( -- cui lampada tradat) and that a
glorious one at length, Christ, who is (...) Light essential, Joh. 12.46. Of
Ascanius the son of Aeneas, and likewise of Tullus Hostilius, it is storied,
that light flames were seen about their heads, when they lay in their cradles;
and that thereby was foresignified, that they should be Kings.

Verse. 18 His enemies will I cloth with shame] Shame shall be the promotion
of all such fools as set against Christ and his people: yea they shall be
clothed with it; so that it shall be conspicuous to all men.

But upon himself shall his Crown flourish] His royal Diadem, Nezer.
whereby he is separated and distinguished from other men. Alexander dropped his
Diadem once into the water, and because he who fet it out, put it on his own
head whiles he swam out with it, he cut off his head. Our Edward the fourth
hanged one for saying he would make his Son owner of the Crown; though he
only meant his own house (having a Crown for the sign) in Cheapside.

PSALM. CXXXIII.
Verse. 1 Behold how good and how pleasant it is] This, David is thought to have
said to the people, when after eight years unnatural war, they came together
to Hebron, to anoint him King over all Israel, 2 Samuel 5. Behold; be affected
with that happiness of yours which no tongue can utter. Accipe quod sentitur
antequam discitur, as Cyprian says in another case.

How good and how pleasant] Precious and profitable, sweet and delectable,
(...), dainty and goodly, as Rev. 18.14. Communion of Saints is the next
happiness upon earth, to communion with God.

For Brethren] Whether by Place, Race, or Grace, which last is the strongest
tie; and should cause such an harmony of hearts as might resemble that concord
and concent that shall be in Heaven. (...). ^thenaeus. ^^ 3.
The Th^bans in their armies had a band of men they called The holy Band;
consisting of such only as were joined together in the bonds of love, as would
live and dye together: these they made great account of, and esteemed the
strength of their armies.

To dwell together] Heb. Even together, that is, even as God dwells with
them, Psalm. 132. to be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love,
Romans 12.10. to be as those Primitive Christians were, Act. 2. of one heart,
and of one soul. The number of two has by the Heathens been accounted
accursed; because it was the first that departed from Unity.

Verse. 2 It is like the precious ointment] This similitude sets forth the
pleasure and amaenity of it; as the other (from the dew) the profit and
commodity. -- Sic miscuit utile dulci. This ointment was most rich (as made up
of the chiefest spices, Exodus, 30.) and very fragrant, refreshing the senses,
not of Aaron only, but of all about him; ^al. 5.
so does Christian unity and amity (that fruit of the Spirit) far beyond that
common friendship so highly extolled by Cicero, and other Heathens; and is
therefore here fitly compared to that Non-such odoriferous ointment.

Upon the head, that ran down upon the beard] So the Spirit of grace, that oil
of gladness, Psalm. 45.7.) poured out abundantly, even to a redundancy, upon
Christ the head, runs down upon all the members of his body mystical, even
to the meanest, so that they have grace for grace.

Verse. 3 As the dew of Hermon] Moisteneth and makes fertile the Country of
Bashan. Hermon is a very high hill ever covered with snow; whence arises a
perpetual vapor, the original and fountain of dew, to all Jury.

And as the dew that descended] The spiritual dew dispensed from God in Sion,
where he is sincerely served.

For there the Lord commanded the blessing] A powerful expression, highly
commending brotherly love as a complexive blessing, and such as accompanies
salvation.

PSALM. CXXXIV.
Verse. 1 Behold, bless ye the Lord] This short Psalm (the last of the fifteen
Graduals) is br^ve Sacerdotum speculum, says an Expositour; a mirror for
Ministers, who are first excited by a Behold, as by the sounding of a trumpet,
or the ringing of a Sermon-bell: And secondly, exhorted to praise God, and to
pray unto him; whereunto if we add their teaching of Jacob Gods Judgments,
whereof Moses minds them, Deuteronomy. 33.10. what more can be required of
Archippus, to the fulfilling of his ministry? and if he be slack, he must
be told of it, Col. 4.17. yet with all due respect and reverence to his
office, 1 Timothy 5.1. And it were fat better, if they would rouse up themselves
with the wakefull Cock, and not keep sleepy centry in the Sanctuary.

All ye Servants of the Lord] Ye Priests and Levites, who are Gods Servants,
but of a more than ordinary alloy; servants of noblest employment about him.
Such are all faithful Ministers; each of them may say with Paul, Act. 27.23.
whose I am, and whom I serve.

Which by night stand in the house of the Lord] Keeping watch and ward there in
your turns, Number. 58.1, 2, etc. 1 Chronicles. 9.33. The Rabbis say, that the
High Priest only sat in the Sanctuary (as did Eli, 1 Samuel 1.) the rest stood;
as ready pressed to do their office.

Verse. 2 Lift up your hands in the Sanctuary] Or, Lift up holy hands, as 1 Timothy
2.8. One reads it, out of the Hebrew; Lift up your hands, Sanctuary, that is,
ye Sanctuary-men, continens pro contento Hearts and hands must both up to
Heaven, Lam. 3.41. and God be glorified both with spirits and bodies, which
are the Lords, 1 Cor. 6.20.

And bless the Lord] Like so many earth'y Angels; and as if ye were in Heaven
already, say

Verse. 3 The Lord that made Heaven and Earth] And therefore has the blessings
of both lives in his hand to bestow. See Number. 6.24.

Bless thee out of Zion] They are blessings indeed that come out of Zion;
choice, peculiar blessings even above any that come out of Heaven and Earth.
Compare Psalm. 128.5. and the promise, Exodus 20.24. In all places where I put
the memory or my name, I will come unto thee and bless thee.

PSALM. CXXXV.
Verse. 1 Praise ye the Lord, praise yee] Praise, praise; praise. When duties
are thus inculcated, it notes the necessity and excellency thereof; together
with our dullness and backwardness thereunto.

O ye Servants of the Lord] See Psalm. 134.1.

Verse. 2 Ye that stand in the house] See Psalm. 134.1.

In the Courts] Where the people also had a place, 2 Chronicles. 4.9. and are
required to bear a part in this heavenly Halleluiah.

Verse. 3 Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good] scil. Originally,
transcendently, effectively; he is good, and does good, Psalm. 119.68. and is
therefore to be praised with mind, mouth, and practice.

For it is pleasant] An angelical exercise, and, to the spirituall-minded man,
very delicious. To others indeed, who have no true notion of God but as of an
enemy, it is but as music at funerals, or as the trumpet before a Judge; no
comfort to the mourning wife, or guilty prisoner.

Verse. 4 For the Lord has chosen] Gods distinguishing grace should make his
elect lift up many an humble, joyful, and thankful heart to him.

And Israel for his peculiar treasure] Such as he makes more reckoning of,
than of all the World besides. The Hebrew world here rendered peculiar treasure,
seems to signify a Jewel made up of three precious stones, in form of a
triangle. Segull^h. (...) dici S^gol, (...).
The Saints are Gods Jewels, Mal. 3.17. his ornament, yea the beauty of his
ornament, and that set in Majesty, Ezekiel. 7.20. his royal Diadem, Isa. 62.3.

Verse. 5 For I know that the Lord is great] As well as good, verse. 3. This I
believe and know, ( Job. 6.69.) says the Psalmist; and do therefore make it my
practice to praise him.

And that our Lord is above all Gods] Whether they be so deputed (as
Magistrates) or reputed, as Idols.

Verse. 6 Whatsoever the Lord pleased] This the Heathens did never seriously
affirm of any their dunghill deities: sure it is, that none of them could say,
I know it to be so. De diis utrum sint, non ausim affirmare, said one of their
wise men.

Verse. 7 He causes the Vapours] Not Jupiter, but Jehovah (See Jer. 10.13.)
He is the right Nub^coga, Maker of the Metcors, whether fiery, aerie, or
watery, Job 26.8, 9 and 28.26, 27, and 37.11, 15, 16. and 38.9. See the Notes
there.

He makes lightenings for the Rain] Or, With the Rain, which is very strange,
viz. that fire and water should mingle, and hard stones come cut of the midst
of thin vapors.

He brings the wind out of his treasuries] Or Coffers, storehouses, where
he holds them close prisoners, during his pleasure. This, the Philosopher
knew not, and thence it is that they are of so diverse opinions about the
winds. See Job 36.27, 28, etc. and Job. 37. throughout.

Verse. 8 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt] And thereby roused up that sturdy
rebel Pharaoh, who began now to open his eyes, as they say the blind mole
does, when the pangs of death are upon him; and to stretch out himself, as the
crooked Serpent does, when deadly wounded.

Verse. 9 Who sent tokens and wonders] Vocal wonders, Exodus 4.8. to be as so
many warning-peeces.

Verse. 10 Who smote great Nations] Who, by their great sins, had greatly
polluted their land; and filled it with fi^th from one end to another, Ezra
9.11.

And slow mighty Kings] Heb. Bony, big, mastiff fellows, quasi ^ss^t^s, five
(...) as the word signifies.

Verse. 11 Sihon King of Amorites] A Giant like Cyclops.

And Og King of Bashan] Of whom the Jews fable, that, being one of the (...)
Giants, he escaped the flood, by riding affride upon the Ark.

Verse. 12 And gave their lands for an heritage] Which he might well do, as
being the true Proprietary, and Paramount.

Verse. 13 Thy Name, O Lord, etc.] Else, O nos ingratos!

Verse. 14 For the Lord will judge his people] Judicabit, id est vindicabit, he
will preserve them, and provide for their welfare.

And he will repent himself] This is, mutatio rei non Dei, effectus non
affectus. Some render it, He will be propitious, Others, he will take
comfort in his Servants. See Judges 10.16.

Verse. 15, 16. The Idols of the Heathen] See Psalm. 115.4, 5, 6, etc.

Verse. 17 Neither is there any breath in their mouths] If they uttered Oracles,
it was the Devil in them, and by them. As for those statues of Daedalus which
are said to have moved, Aristot. Diod. Sic. Plato.
spoken, and run away if they were not tied to a place, etc. it is either a
fiction, or else to be attributed to causes external and artificial, as
quicksilver, etc.

Verse. 18 They that make them, etc.] See Psalm. 115.8.

Verse. 19 Bless the Lord] And not an Idol, Isa. 66.3. as the Philistines did
their Dagon; and as Papists still do their hee-Saints, and shee-Saints.

Verse. 20 Ye that fear the Lord] Ye devout Proselytes.

Verse. 21 Blessed be the Lord out of Sion] There-hence he blesses, Psalm.
134.3. and there he is to be blessed.

Which dwells at Jerusalem] That was the seat of his royal resiance, per
inhabitationis gratiam, says Austin, by the presence of his grace; who by his
essence and power, is every where.

Enter, praesenter, Deus hic et ubique potenter.

PSALM. CXXXVI.
Verse. 1 O give thanks unto the Lord] This Psalm is by the Jews called Hillel
gadel, the great Gratulatory. See Psalm. 106.1.107.1.118.1.

For his mercy endures for ever] His Covenant-mercy, that precious
Church-priviledge: this is perpetual to his people, and should perpetually
shine as a picture in our hearts. For which purpose this Psalm was appointed to
be daily sung in the old Church, by the Levites, 1 Chronicles. 16.41.

Verse. 2 For his mercy endures for ever] This is the foot or burden of the
whole song; neither is it any idle repetition, but a notable expression of the
Saints unsatisfiableness in praising God for his never-failing mercy. These
heavenly birds, having got a note, record it over and over. In the last Psalm,
there are but six verses, yet twelve Hallelujahs.

Verse. 3 O Give thanks to the Lord of Lords] That is to God the Son, says
Hier^^; as by God of Gods, says he, in the former verse, is meant God the
Father: who because they are no more but one God only, it is added

Verse. 4 To him who alone does great wonders] Wondrous things the Creature may
do, but not wonders; mira sed non miracula, God alone is the great
Th^uma^^rgus, that is, wonder-worker.

Verse. 5 To him that by wisdom, etc.] Singulari ingenio and summa industria,
yet without tool, or toil, See Heb. 11.10. with the Note.

Verse. 6 To him that stretched out the earth, etc.] A perpetual mercy in all
earthly Creatures, as is elsewhere set forth, Genesis 1.9. Psalm. 24.2.

Verse. 7 To him that made great lights] Without which we should have no more
comfort of the air we breath on than the Egyptians had in that three-dayes
darkness. Now the Sun and Moon are called great Luminaries, not great stars or
bodies (for the Sun is less than some stars, and the Moon is least of all)
first, for the excellency of light which these two do more abundantly impart to
the earth, and secondly, for the effects they work; the Sun by his access
making all green and flourishing, and the contrary by his recess the Moon by
his various aspect causing humors and marrows to increase or decrease etc.

Verse. 8 The Sun to (...) the day] Heb. For the rulings by day (...) by his
light, (...) bodies, (...) ruledomes; and therefore in no wise to have been
worshipped.

Verse. 9 The Moon and stars to rule by night] For by day they all veil to the
Sun; from whom also they borrow much of their light. The Moon has her name in
Hebrew from moisture; as refreshing the earth with her cool influences; and
thrusting forth precious things therein, Deuteronomy. 33.14.

Verse. 10 To him that smote Egypt] See Psalm. 135.8.

Verse. 11 And brought out Israel] viz. By that last plague; for the former
would not do. God will have the better of his enemies, for the good of his
people: for it is not fit that he should lay down the bucklers first.

Verse. 12 And with a stretcht-out arm] A metaphor from soldiers exercising
their arms, with utmost might and slight.

Verse. 13 To him which divided the red Sea] Into twelve several parts, say the
Jews, for the twelve Tribes to pass through.

Verse. 14 And made Israel to pass, etc.] It is many times hail with the Saints,
when ill with the wicked. Abraham from the hill sees Sodom on fire.

Verse. 15 But overthrew Pharaoh] Praecipitavit, pitched him in headlong; having
before paved a way for him. Subito tollitur qui diu toleratur.

Verse. 16 To him which led his people] As an horse that they should not
stumble, Isa. 63.13. as a Shepherd his sheep; providing for them so, as never
was any Prince so served in his greatest pomp.

Verse. 17 To him which smote great Kings] Great, as those times accounted them,
when every small City almost had her King: Canaan had thirty and more of them.
Great also in regard of their stature and strength; for they were of the Giants
race, Deuteronomy. 3. Amos 2.

Verse. 18 And slew famous Kings] Magnificos, sumpt^osos, fastuosos, and
arrogantes.

Verse. 19, 20.] ^ee Psalm. 135.11. Sihons Country was afterward called
Decapolis, and the Metropolis of it Scythopolis, Joseph. de bell. l. 3. c. 2.

Verse. 21, 22. And gave] See Psalm. 135.12. and Josh. 12.7. he paid them well
for their pains, after that he had made use of their sword and service,
against those sinners against their own souls.

Verse. 23. Who remembered us in our low estate] Still God helps those who are
forsaken of their hopes, and vindictae gladium miserationis oleo emollit, as
Nicephorus says.

Verse. 24 And has redeemed us] Or, Broken us off, pulled us away, as by
violence; for they would never else have loosed us. This is priori major
misericordia, a greater mercy than the former, says Kimchi; to redeem is more
than to preserve.

Verse. 25 Who gives food to all flesh] Food agreeable to their several
appetites, and temperaments, suitable and seasonable.

Verse. 26 O give thanks unto the God of Heaven] His mercy in providing Heaven
for his people, is more than all the rest.

PSALM. CXXXVII.
Verse. 1 By the rivers of Babylon] Tigr^s and Euphrates; for the land of Shinar
(where Babel was founded, and afterward Babylon built) was, as most
Geographers think, a part of the Garden of Eden, fruitful beyond credulity;
but to the poor captives all this was no comfort, when they remembered the
desolations of their Country, and the loss of their former liberty. The bird of
Paradise, they say, once taken and encaged, groaneth uncessantly, till she dye.

There we sat down, yea we wep^] He sits alone, and keeps silence,
because he has born it upon him, says Jeremy of the Mourner, Lam. 3.28. who
is much in meditation; so were these, bewailing bitterly their sin and misery,
with their bowels sounding as an harp, Isa. 16.1. where if one string be
touched, all the rest sound.

When we remembered Zion] The former solemnities, the present desolations.

Verse. 2 We hanged out harps] Harps we had, and knew how to handle them (the
Jews were famous Artists, noted for their skill specially in Poetry, Music,
and Mathematics) but we had little mind to it as now the case stood with us;
Ho^^^ lib. 3. Od. 26.
our Country lying desolate, our selves could not be but disconsolate.
Barbiton his paries habe^it.

Verse. 3 For there -- they required of us a song] scil. In disdain and derision
of our Religion, q.d. Will ye sing no more holy songs in honor of your God?
has he utterly cast away all care of your welfare, and you the like of his
service? Have you never a black Sanctis to sing us? or cannot you sing care
away, etc? where are your wonted ditties, ^eza.
the words of a song? Ehodum, bellos nobis illos vestr^ Sionis modules
cantillate.

And they that wasted us] Cumulatores nostri, vel Concumulatores nostri, vel
homines ejulatuum nostrorum, they that made us howl singing, as Isa. 52.5. Or
In suspensionibus nostris, ^socr.
after that we had hanged up our harps, as verse. 2. (...).

Sing us one of the songs of Zion] Wherewith ye were wont to praise God. So
Baltasar abused the bowls of the Sanctuary. So the bloody-Persecutors at
Orleance, as they murdered the Protestants, required them to sing, Judge and
revenge my cause, O Lord; and have mercy on us Lord, etc.

Verse. 4 Shall we sing the Lords song, etc?] No; for that were to profane
holy things; and as Nazianzen speaks, (...). And besides, they had as much
mind to be merry then, and thus, as Sampson had to play before the
Philistines. Music in mourning is not more unseasonable, than unsavory. When
our Edward the third had the King of Scots and the French King both prisoners
together here in England, he held royal justs, and feasted them sumptuously.
After supper, perceiving the French King to be sad and pensive, he desired
him to be merry as others were. To whom the French King answered, as here, How
shall we sing in a strange Land? Quid nobis cum fabulis, cum risu, says
Bernard, in hoc exilio, in hoc ergastulo, in hac valle lachrymarum? Let us cast
away carnal mirth, and groan earnestly to be clothed upon with our house
which is from Heaven, 2 Cor. 5.2.

Verse. 5 I^ I forget thee, O Jerusalem] As I might seem to do, should I herein
gratify these Idolaters; or otherwise obey them, rather than God. The Jews at
this day, when they build an house, they are, say the Rabbines, to leave one
part of it unfinished, and lying rude, in remembrance that Jerusalem and the
Temple are at present desolate. At least they use to leave about a yard square
of the house unplaistered, on which they write, Leo Modena of the ri^es of the
Jews.
in great letters, this of the Psalmist, If I forget Jerusalem, etc. or else
these words Zecher lechorban, that is, The memory of the desolation.

Let my right hand forget] Fiat abalienata atque emortua, Let it be
paralyticall and useless, unfit to touch the harp.

Verse. 6 If I do not remember thee] Hi gemitus Sanctorum sunt gemitus Spiritus
sancti, these are the very sighs unutterable, that precede joys unspeakable,
and full of glory. Either our beds are soft, or our hearts hard, that can rest
when the Church is at unrest, that feel not our Brethrens hard cords through
our soft beds.

If I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy] Heb. If I cause it not to ascend
above the head of my joy. Christ in his Ordinances must be our chiefest
comfort, overtopping all other; and devouring all discontents whatsoever.

Verse. 7 Remember, O Lord the Children of Edom] Those unbrotherly bitter
enemies. The Jews call Romists, Edomites.

Raze it, raze it] Discooperite, discooperite. Diruite, ex imis subvertite
fundamentis. Buchanan:


Darius hearing that Sardis was sacked and burnt by the Athenians, commanded
one of his servants to say to him thrice always at supper, Sir remember the
Athenians to punish them. (...). Herod. T^rp.


Verse. 8 That art to be destroyed] Spoliatrix, says the Syriack, Isa. 33.1.

Happy shall he bee] i. e. Well rewarded with wealth and good wishes.

Verse. 9 That takes and dasheth thy little ones] So at the destruction of
Troy. Sed palam raptis (heu nefas, heu)
Nescios fari puer^s, Achivis
Ureret flammis, etiam latentes
M^tris in alve. Horat. l. 4. Od. 6.



PSALM. CXXXVIII.
Verse. 1 I will praise thee with my whole heart] Which no Hypocrite can do;
though he may pray in distress from the bottom of his heart. A grateful manis
a gracious man, viz. if he come with a true heart, as the Apostle has it,
Heb. 10.22. Aben-Ezra.


Before the Gods will I sing praise unto thee] That is, before Angels, who are
present in holy assemblies, 1 Cor. 11.10. (as was represented by those
Cherubines pictured in the Temple) as also before Princes and Potentates; see
verse. 4. Kimchi.


Verse. 2 I will worship toward thy holy Temple] Wheresoever I am, the face of
my soul shall turn, like the needle of a Dial, by sacred instinct, Abbot.
toward thee in the Ark of thy presence, in the son of thy love.

For thy loving kindness, and for thy truth] For thy grace and truth which come
by Jesus Christ: the Ark and Mercy-seat were never sundred. Gods loving
kindness in Christ moved him to promise, his truth binds him to perform, and
hence our happiness.

For thou have magnified thy Word above all thy Name] Or, Thou have magnified
thy name in all thy Words. Or, Thou have magnified above all things thy Name by
thy Word; that is, Thou have got thee a very great name, by fulfilling thy
promises; and by setting on thy Word with power.

Verse. 3 In the day when I cried, etc.] This he worthily celebrateth as a
singular favor, a badge of grace, Psalm. 66.18. and pledge of glory, Act. 2.21.

And strengthenedst me with strength in my soul] With strength in the inward
man, Ephesians. 3.16, 20. with spiritual metal, with supporting grace; keeping
head above water: My body is weak, my soul is well, said that dying Saint. I am
as full of comfort as heart can hold, said a certain Martyr. The Apostle
speaks of the new supplies of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, Phil. 1.19. the joy
of the Lord is strengthening, (...)
Neh. 8.10.

Verse. 4 All the Kings of the earth shall praise thee] Such of them as shall
read these Psalms of my composing: or otherwise shall hear of thy gracious
dealing with me, according to thy promise. Such also as shall hereafter be
converted to the faith; for though Not many mighty, not many noble are called,
1 Cor. 1.26. yet some are, and these shine in the Church, like stars of the
first magnitude.

Verse. 5 Yea they shall sing in the ways of the Lord] As having tasted the
excellency of the comforts of godliness (far surpassing those of the Crown and
Scepter) and felt the power of Gods Word subduing them to the obedience of
faith, whereby they come to rule with God, to be faithful with his Saints,
and to sing their songs.

Verse. 6 Though the Lord be high, etc.] Even the high and lofty one that
inhabiteth eternity, Isa 57.15. See on Psalm. 113.6, 7.

Yet has he respect unto the lowly] This makes that Ancient cry out, Videte
magnum miraculum. See here a great miracle; God is on high: thou liftest thy
self up, Aug. de Temp.
and he flies from thee; thou bowest thy self down, and he descends unto
thee. Low things he looks close upon, that he may raise them higher; lofty
things he knows a far off, that he may crush them down lower. The proud
Pharisee pressed as near God as he could; the poor Publican not daring to do
so, stood a loof of; yet was God far from the Pharisee, near, to the Publican.
The Lord Christ is a door to Heaven, Aug. in Joha^
but a low door: he who will enter in thereby, humiliet se oportet, ut sano
capite intrare contingat, says Austin he must needs stoop to save his
head-peece.

But the proud he knows a far off] As not vouchsafing to come anear such
loathsome lepers. For pride is like a great swelling in the body, apt to
putrify, break, and run with loathsome and foul matter. Hence God stands off
from such, as odious and abominable; he cannot abide the sight of them;
Superb^s a calo long propellit, as the Chaldee here paraphraseth, he drives
the proud far enough off from Heaven, yea he thrusts them into Hell, to
their Father Lucifer, that King of all the children of pride, as Leviathan is
called, Job 41.34.

Verse. 7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble] Even in the vale of the shadow
of death, so that I seem little different from a dead man.

Thou will revive mee] That is, restore me from so great a death, as 2 Cor.
^.10.

Thou shall stretch forth thine hand] Thou shall interpose thy help betwixt me
and them, and save me harmless; as the (...) feign their Gods did those whom
they favored. Thou shall strike them with thy left hand, and save me with thy
right: so Tremellius senseth it.

Verse. 8 The Lord will perfect that which concerns mee] He will not do his
business to the halves, leave it in the midst, but carry it on to a
consummation, and lay the top-stone of grace: this I am well assured of. See
Phil. 1.6. Only I must pray, and do my part; having an eye still to Gods
everlasting mercy in Christ.

Forsake not the works of thine own hands] Look upon the wounds of thine hands,
and forsake not the works of thine hands, prayed Queen Elizabeth. And Luthers
usual prayer was, Confirm, O God, in us that thou have wrought, and perfect
the work that thou have begun in us, to thy glory: So be it. Though the good
work of grace be begun in us, yet we can neither persevere in that grace, nor
bring it forth to act, without new grace: Even as trees, though they be fitted
to bear fruit, yet without the influence of the heavens, they cannot put forth
that fitness in fruit, etc.

PSALM. CXXXIX.
A Psalm of David] There is not in all the five books of Psalms, so notable a
one as this (says Aben-Ezra concerning the ways of God, and the workings of
conscience. It was penned, says the Syriack Interpreter, upon occasion of
Shime^'s railing upon him for a bloody man, and a Belialist, 2 Samuel 16. Here
therefore he purges himself by an appeal to God; and delivers up his
false-accusers to Gods just judgment, verse. 19.

Verse. 1 O Lord thou have searched me and known mee] Even mine heart and reins
( Jer. 17.10.) have thou searched as with lights, ( Zeph. 1.12.) by an exact
scrutiny, by a soul-searching inquisition; whereby thou art come to know me
thorough and thorough: Not only Me natural, as verse. 15, 16. but also Me
civil and moral, as verse 2.3, etc. neither stays thy knowledge in the porch
or lobbies (my words and ways) but passes into the presence, yea
privy-Chamber: for

Verse. 2 Thou know my down-sitting, and mine up-rising] All my postures,
gestures, practices, sive sedeam, sive s^rgam, whether I sit, stand, walk, lie;
thou searchest and know all. Some search, but know not; thou do both:
thine eyes behold, thine eye-lidstry the Children of men, Psalm. 11.4. See the
Note there.

Thou understandest my thought] Heb. My familiar thoughts, such as I am
delighted in, voluntatem meam, some render it, my will; others, propinquitatem
meam, my nearness; and that afar off, even from Heaven, being intimo meo mihi
intimior, not so far from me as the bark is from the tree, the skin from the
flesh, or the flesh from the bones.

A far off] Eminus, a long pranovisti, ^^tequam movea^ur, says Chrisostom;
thou know my thoughts before I have conceived them; my thoughts in Pass,
from all eternity: so great is thy sagacity and perspicacity. As a man that
knows what roots he has in his Garden, though there be not a flower
appearing, yet he can say, when the Spring comes, this and this will come up:
so here; God knows our whole frame, our Principles, etc.

Verse. 3 Thou compassest my path] Or, Thou wi^^^^^st; if there be any chaff or
trash, thou will make it fly; thou art at both ends of all my works, and
enterprises, both by day and by night, Per^^^^ and per^^^. Neither art thou
only at my fingers ends, but at my tongues end too.

Verse. 4 For there is not a word in my tongue] Though not yet uttered, or but
whispered only.

Thou know it altogether] Every tittle of it; thou understandest the
language of men's hearts.

Verse. 5 Thou have beset (...) behind and (...)] As a beast that is pursued, as
an enemy that is begirt and environed. And lest I should think by some means to
make escape, (as David did from Saul and his Host, by a providence, 1 Samuel
23.27. as Hannibal did from the Romans by a stratagem.)

Thou (...)] A^by an (...) so that I am thy prisoner, and cannot stir a foot
from thee.

Verse. 6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for mee] I can hardly conceive of
this thine omniscience, and omnipresence, but am ready to measure thee by my
self, and according to mine own module. And indeed, for a creature to believe
the infinite Attributes of God, he is never able to do it thoroughly, without
supernatural grace.

I^ i^ high, I cannot attain unto it] Since it far exceeds the reach of
reason, and is much above my capacity and understanding. I stand at gaze, and
am aghast, and that is the nearest that I a poor finite foolish creature can
come to so infinite a wisdom. It was therefore a good speech of them who being
asked what God was? answered, Si scirem, Deus essem, If I knew that, I should
be a God.

Verse. 7 Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Here he argues Gods omniscience
from his omnipresence; and this the Heathens also had heard of, as appears by
their Jovis omnia plena; and -- quascu^que accesseris oras. Sub Jove semp^^
eris, etc.

Empedocles could say, that God is a circle, whose center is every where, whose
circumference is no where. They could tell us that God is the soul of the
World: and that as the soul is tota in toto, and tota in qualibet part, so is
he that his eye is in every corner, etc. to which purpose they so pourtraied
their goddess Minerva, that which way soever one cast his eye, she always
beheld him. But these divine notions they might have by tradition from the
Patriarchs: and whether they believed themselves in these and the like,
sayings, is much to be doubted.

Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?] Surely no whither: they that
attempt it, do but as the fish which swimmeth to the length of the line, with
an hook in the mouth.

Verse. 8 If I ascend up into Heaven thou art there] That Is thy proper place;
and there Aristotle in his book of the World ad Alexand^^^ affirms that God
is only, essentialit^r and act^. This was to proclaim himself an arrant
Atheist: for God fills all places, and is comprehended of no place, being
totally present, wheresoever present; for we must not conceive that God is
commensurable by the place, as if he were partly here, and partly elsewhere;
but every where, all-present.

Verse. 9 If I take the wings of the morning] The morning light is diffused in
an instant all the whole w^lkin over. If I could fly never so swiftly from one
end of the Heaven to the other, says David, I should be never the near. This
is a poetical expression.

And dwell in the uttermost parts of the Sea] Or of the West, whither the Sun
setting is said to hasten, and hide himself. The Syriack and Arabic have it,
If I take the wings of the Eagle and dwell, etc. And of the Eagle they write,
that when she would change her feathers, she falls down into the Sea.

Verse. 10 Even there shall thy hand lead mee] i. e. Thy Power and Providence
shall dispose of me, I shall flee but from thy hand, to thy hand as guilty
Jonas did.

Verse. 11 The darkness shall cover mee] The Hebrew phrase is taken from Beasts
that lie a squat, says D^odat. Nocte latent mende, sed non Deum. The guilty
conscience sharketh up and down for comfort, but gets none.

Verse. 12 Yea the darkness bideth not] Heb. Darkeneth not from thee, because
thine eyes are fiery, Rev. 1.14. such as need no outward light: they are more
light and radiant than the Sun in his strength.

The darkness and the light etc.] Deo obscura clarent, muta respondent,
silenti^^ confitetur, says an Ancient: Night will convert it self into noon
before God: and silence prove a speaking evidence.

Verse. 13 For thou have possessed my reins] The seat of mine affections
Thoughts kindle affections, and these cause thoughts to boil; they are causes
one of another, and both well known to God. For who possesses lands or houses,
but he knows the right title and rooms thereof, says an Expositour? T. W.


Thou have covered me in my Mothers womb] But not from thine all peircing
eyes, though in so dark a place, and wrapped up in sec^^d^^es.

Verse. 14 I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully, made] (...)
operibus t^^s, says Montan^s; neither can I wonder enough at thy workmanship.
The greatest miracle in the World is man; in whose very body (how much more in
his soul?) are miracles enough (betwixt head and feet) to fill a volume. Austin
complains that men much wonder at high mountains of the earth, huge waves of
the Sea, deep falls of rivers, the vastness of the Ocean, the motions of the
stars, and relinquunt seipsos nec mirantur, but wonder not at all at their
wonderful selves. Fernel. de ab^^^. rerum cau^^.
Galen, a profane Physician, writing of the excellent parts of man's body, and
coming to speak of the double motion of the lungs could not choose but sing an
hymn to that God, whosoever he were, that was author of so excellent and
admirable a piece of work.

And that my soul knows right well] That is, so well, as to draw hearty
praises from me to my Maker. But for any exact insight, hear Solomon; As thou
know not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the
womb of her that is with child: even so thou know not the works of God, who
makes all, Eccles. 11.5. Some read the words thus, Thy works are wonderful,
and so is my soul which knows right well. q. d. my rational and intelligent
soul is an admirable piece indeed. Nothing in the World, says one, is so well
worthy to be wondered at as man, nothing in man, as his soul.

Verse. 15 My substance was not hid from mee] Ossati^ mea, id est ossium (...)
tuum compages, ^embles mis^hief of ignor.
the structure of my bones and joints. But was not he a wise man (and yet wise
enough otherwise) who being asked upon his deathbed what his soul was?
seriously answered; that he knew not well; but he thought it was a great bone
in the middle of his body?

Was not hid from thee] For thou have both the names and number of every part,
to a nerve or an artery; Aquinas says, that at the Resurrection, the bodies of
the Saints shall be so clear and transparent, that all the veins, humors,
nerves, and bowels shall be seen, as in a glass. It Is sure, that they are so to
God, when first formed in the womb.

When I was made in secret] That is, in the womb of my Mother. As curious
workmen, ^^de Lactant. ^^ Dei opificio ^alen. de usu ^rt. Cic. 2. de ^^t. dear.
when they have some choice piece in hand, they perfect it in private; and then
bring it forth to light, for men to gaze at: so here.

And curiously wrought] Variegatus, and quasi acu pictus, Embroidered and
wrought as with the needle; whence man is called a Microcosm, or little World.
Bodine observes, that there are three regions within man's body (besides all
that is seen without) answerable to those three regions of the World
Elementary, Etherial, and Celestial. His entrails and whatsoever is under his
heart resemble the Elementary region, wherein only there is Generation and
Corruption; (...). N^^. ^^^
The heart and vitals that are divided from those entrails by the Diaphragma,
resemble the Ethereall Region: as the brain does the heavenly, which consists
of intelligible creatures.

In the lowest parts of the earth] That is, in my Mothers womb, as before. See
Ep^es. 4.9. The Syriack interprets it (but not so well) when I shall dye, and
be buried, and my bones turned to ashes, yet thou shall know them.

Verse. 16 Thine eyes did see my substance] Galmi; est semen coagulatum ante
formationem membrorum, says Kimchi; when I was but an Embryo, or hardly so
much. Disponit Deus membra culicis, and pulicis, says Austin how much more of
man? The word signifies my wound-up or unwrought-up mass.

And in thy book all my members are written] A metaphor from curious workmen,
that do all by the book, or by a model set before them, that nothing may be
deficient, or done amiss. Had God left out an eye in his commonplace book,
says One, thou had wanted it.

Which in Continuance] In process of time, and by degrees.

When as yet there was none of them] But all was a rude lump. This is a great
secret of nature, and to be modestly spoken of.

How precious also are thy thoughts unto mee] i. e. The thoughts of thy
wisdom, power, and goodness, clearly shining in these wondrous works of thine:
it does my heart good to think and speak of them.

How great is the sum of them] viz. Of my works, and of thy thoughts thereon.
I cannot count them, much less comprehend them. To blame are such as trouble
not their heads at all about these matters. Surely when the Lord made (...)
head with so many closures and coverings to his brain, the seat of
understanding, he intended it for some precious treasure. Many locks and keys
argue the price of the Jewel they are to keep; and many papers wrapping a
token within them, the use of that token.

Verse. 18 If I should count them, etc.] q. d. They are: infinite and
innumerable. Archimedes that great Mathematician bragged, that he could number
all the sands in the habitable and inhabitable World, but no man ever believed
him. See 1 Samuel 13.5. 2. Sam. 17.11. Psalm. 78.27.

When I awake, I am still with thee] Still taken up with some holy
contemplation of thy works, and wisdom. These thoughts I fall asleep with, and
these I awake with. As I take up my fire ore night, so I find it in the
morning.

Verse. 19 Surely thou will slay the wicked] Those that traduce and slander me
for an Hypocrite and a Belialist. Some render it, O that thou would slay
them! in as much as they hate me for my zeal, and forwardness to turn the
wheel of Justice over them, and to give them their due and condign punishment;
for, for mine own part, I cannot abide them, but bid them Avaunt, with

Depart from me, ye bloody men] Ye that dare to destroy so goodly a piece of
Gods handy work as man is above described to be. See Genesis 9.6. Or ye that
seek to double undo me; first by detraction and then by deadly practice. See
Ezekiel. 22.9. In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood.

Verse. 20 For they speak against thee wickedly] Inasmuch as they speak against
me; Tua causa erit mea ca^sa, said Charles the fifth Emperor to Jutius
Pflugi^^, who complained he had been wronged by the Duke of Saxo^y; so says
God to every David. This Luther knew and therefore wrote thus to Melancthon,
Causa ut sit magna, magnus est actor, and auctor ejus; neque enim nostra est.
The cause is Christ's; and he will see to it and us. Moses told the people that
their murmurings were not against him, but against the Lord, Exodus 16.8. As
unskilful hunters, shooting at wild beasts, kill a man sometimes, so whilst
men shoot at Christians, they hit Christ.

And thine enemies take thy name in vain] Whilst they would despoil thee o^
thine omnipresence; omnipotence, etc. casting thee into a dishonorable mould
as it were, and having base and bald conceits and speeches of thee and thine.
Kimchi interprets it of Heretics, those false friends, but true enemies to
God; of whom they make great boasts, as did the Gnostics, Manichees,
Novatians, and alate the Swenkfeldians (who styled themselves the Confessors
of the Glory of Christ) and many of our modern Sectaries.

Verse. 21 Do not I hate them, O Lord] And therefore hate them because they hate
thee? This the Hebrews understand of Heretics and Apostates. See a like zeal
in that Angel of Ephesus, Rev. 2.2.

And am not I grieved] Or, irked, made ready to vomit at (as at some loathsome
spectacle) fretted, vexed.

Verse. 22 I hate them with a perfect batred] That is, unfeignedly, and with a
round heart (says one) for this only cause, that they are workers of iniquity.
It was said of Antony, he hated a Tyrant, not Tyranny, and of Craessus he
hated a covetous man, not covetousness. It may as truly be said of an
Hypocrite, He hates sinners, not sins; these he nourishes, those he
censureth. David was none such; and yet, as something mistrusting his own
heart, he thinks good to add,

Verse. 23 Search me O God, and know my heart] Look into every corner and
cranny, and see whether it be not so as I say, viz. that I hate wicked men
merely for their wickedness: and for no self-respect have I thus cast down the
gauntlet of defiance unto them, and bidden them battle. We should not rest
(says a Reverend man) in our hearts voice, nor accept its deceitful applause.
But as once Joshuah seeing the Angel examined him. Art thou (...) out side, or
on the adversaries? so should we deal in this case; yea, beg of God to do it
for us, and do it thoroughly, as here: this is a sure sign of (...), void of
all (...).

Verse. 24 And see if there be any wicked way in mee] Heb. Any way of pain,
(...) of grief, or, of (...); any course of sin that is grievous to God or man.
Quae spir^^^^ tuum ve^^t, ^^ Psalm. 7^. Abo^^ Ezra.
A Saint allows not of any wickedness, walloweth not in it, makes it not
histrade* is not transformed into sins image, his (...) but (as in right ^ine
or Honey) it is continually cast out. The good heart admits not the (...)
any sin. Sin may cleave to it, as dross to silver, but it enters not into the
frame and constitution, it is not weaved into the texture of a good man's heart:
there is no such way of wickedness to be found in him, no such evil heart of
unbelief as to depart away from the living God, Heb. 3.12. There is no time
wherein he cannot say, as (...). 1^.^^. Pray for us: for we trust we have a
good conscience in all things, willing to please God.

And lead me in the way everlasting] Heb. In the way of eternity, or of
antiquity, that good old way, Jer. 6.16. traced by Adam, Abraham, Moses, etc.
and that leads to Heaven. Rid my heart of those remnants of Hypocrisy, and
help me, to perfect (...) in the fear of God, ^ Cor. 7.1.

PSALM. CXL.
Verse. 1 Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man] Made of malice, in which is
steeped the venom of all vices.

Preserve me from the violent man] Man of violences, who vulture-like, (
Levit. 11.10.) lives by rapine. Such were Saul and his Sycophants.

Verse. 2 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart] Where the Devil works night
and day as a mintman; as a Smith in his forge; or an Artificer in his shop. A
godly man is said to have right thoughts, Prove. 12.5. and that his desires are
only good, chap. 11.23. An evil man is called a man of wicked devices, Prove.
12.2. and 14, 17. being ingeniose nequam, wittily wicked, as it was once said
of C. Curio the Roman Lawyer.

They are gathered together for war] Heb. They gather wars, as Serpents gather
poison to vomit out at others. Coaceruant praelia. q. d. sunt tanquam tube
belli.


Verse. 3 They have sharpened their tongues like a Serpent] Which by reason of
his sharp tongue, strikes more deeply.

Adders poison] Venenum Payados. R. Solomon reads Spiders poison; others,
Aspes, Vipers. Malice turns men into Serpents, says Chrysostom.

Verse. 4 Keep mee] Who am thus sought and set for; but thou can rescue me.

To overthrow my goings] Pracipitare, to hurl me down headlong.

Verse. 5 The proud have hid a snare, etc.] They are restless to ruin me,
adding all kind of craft to their cruelty.

Verse. 6 I said unto the Lord] Danger drove David home to God; as bug bears do
little Children, to their Parents.

Verse. 7 In the day of battel] Heb. Of armor; for battle David never had any
with Saul, but declined it.

Verse. 8 Grant not O Lord, etc.] For if they should be (...) competes, Masters
of their desires, they would be intolerably insolent, so as to say, Our high
hand, and not the Lord has done all this, Deuteronomy. 32.27.

Verse. 9 As for the head] The chieftain, the ringleader, D^^g or Saul himself.
Or thus, Let mischief cover the heads of my besieger^ Let it fall upon their
pates, as Psalm. 7. Similitude est a sacreficiis, (...) execrabantur.

Verse. 10. Let burning coals fall upon them] Conflagrant (...). Haec (...) v^ta
quam vaticinia.

Verse. 11 Let not an evil-speaker] Heb. A man of tongue, whereof Peraldus
reckons up four and twenty several (...): A world of wickedness, St. James
calls it, chap. 3.

Evil shall (...) the (...) man] The Angel of death shall hunt him into Hell,
says the Chald^^. Of the black-birds (...), is made bird-lime to catch him. ^.
Mar^^s was slain with the sword he made, when (...) was a Cutler. (...) ^^^^^
pe^ire (...) est, was Juli^^s M^^^^ Gods Judgments against sinners are

body.

Verse. 12 I know] For I have a promise for it, and that is infallible.

Verse. 13 Shall (...)] He shall have no other cause.

(...) When the (...) shall (...) Job 23.16.

PSALM. CXLI.
Verse. 1 Lord I cry unto thee] No distress or danger, how greatsoever shall
stifle my faith, or stop my mouth, but make me more earnest and my prayers
like strong streams in narrow strains, shall bear down all before them.

Make haste unto mee] Lest help come too late.

Verse. 2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense] Faithful prayer
is (...) (says Da^asen) the ascension of the heart to God. Dim. de fide.
In this incense how many sweet spices are burned together by the fire of
faith, as humility, hope, love, etc? all which come up for a memorial before
God: Act. 10.4.
and the Saints (as Manoahs Angel) ascend up in the flame, and do wonderously,
Judge. 13.19, 20. whilst their pillars of smoke are perfumed with myrrh and
frankincense, with all powders of the spice-Merchant, Cant. 3.6. that is, with
the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, Heb. 9.24. those sweet odours poured
into the prayers of Saints, Rev. 5.8. and 8.4. for want whereof the incense of
the wicked is abomination, Isa. 1.13. as stinking of the hand that offers it.

As the evening Sacrifice] The sacrificium juge, that was offered every morning
and evening, Exodus 29.39. Numb. 28.4. in reference to that immaculate Lamb of
God, slain from the beginning, for an offering and a sweet smelling savor,
Ephesians. 5.2. Chrysostom tells us, that the Greek Church made use of this Psalm
in their evening-Liturgie.

Verse. 3 Set a Watch, O Lord, before my mouth] Orat pro patientia; says One,
here he prays for patience; lest by giving himself leave to over-lash, he
make the matter much worse. The best patience long tried, and hard put to it,
may miscarry, to its cost.

Keep the door of my lips] That it move not creaking, Dal pro Deleth per
Apo^cp^n poc^icam.
and complaining as on rusty hinges, for want of the oil of joy and gladness.
David had somewhat to do with his tongue, as we see, Psalm. 39.1.3. and when
he had carted the Ark, how untowardly spoke he, as if the fault were more in
God than himself, that there was such a breach made in Uzzah, 1 Chronicles. 15.2? It
was but need therefore thus to pray.

Verse. 4 Incline not my heart] Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
speaks. For the better ordering of his words, therefore he prays, not to
be delivered up to Satan, and to his own hearts lust (as he was, 1 Chronicles 21.1.
with 2 Samuel 24.1.) for God tempts no man, but the Devil and his own
concupiscence, Jam. 1.13, 14. but to be bent the better way by Gods
over-powering efficacious grace, and to be stablished with his free Spirit,

To practice wicked works] The Vulgar renders it, ad excusandas excusationes
in peccatis, to frame excuse for mine offenses; but that, when I have
over-lasht, Gnala^ significat operaticut occasion pratex^u, causa.
I may confess and forsake, and so find mercy.

And let me not eat of their dainties] Their murdering morsels of iniquity,
The Chaldee^ expounds i^ of their songs at banquets.
or their tid-bits and baits, whereby Saul's courtiers sought to ensnare him.

Verse. 5 Let the Righteous smite me, etc.] In case I do offend in word or
deed, let me never want a faithful reprover, who may smite me as with a
hammer (so the word signifies) reprove me sharply, Prove. 23.35. Zech. 13.5.
Tit. 1.13. cuttingly, as the Apostles word imports, yet mildly and lovingly,
Gal. 6.1. Prove. 9.8. (...)
and 19.25. and 25.12. with soft words, but hard arguments.

It shall be a kindnesse] David thought the better of Nathan for so roundly
reproving him, 2 Samuel 12. and made him of his Council, 1 King. 1. Peter
thought the better of Paul for dealing so plainly with him at Antioch, Gal. 2.
and makes honorable mention of him, and his writings, 2 Pet. 3. It Is said of
Gerson (that great Chancellor of Paris, that (...) r^ alia tantop^^^
laetaretur, In vita Joh^^ Gerson.
quam si a^ aliquo fraterne and charitarive redargueretur, he rejoiced in
nothing so much as in a friendly reprehension: great pity it was that none
bestowed a shi^ing on him for being so active against John H^^, and Hier^^ of
Pragus, at the council of Constance. Of Queen Anne Bullen, it is reported,
that she was not only willing to be admonished, but required her Chaplains
freely and plainly to tell her of whatsoever was amiss. Mr. Clark Matryrolo^^
p. 78.
Her Daughter Queen Elizabeth was well pleased with Mr. Deerings plain dealing,
who told her in a Sermon that once she was Tanquam ^vis, but now Tanquam
indemita juvenca, as an untamed Heifer: and speaking of the disorders of the
times, These things are so, said he, and you sit still, and do nothing, etc.

It shall be an excellent oil] Heb. A head-oil, such as they poured on their
friends heads; and that was of the best.

Which shall not break my head] My heart it may. Or, Let him not make it ^ail
my head, let him not cease to do me this good office daily; I shall count it a
courtesy, and requite it with my best prayers for him, in his greatest
necessity.

For yet my prayer also shall be in their calamity] I will not curse them for
their good counsel, rail at them for reproving me, or insult over them in
misery as justly met withal; but pray for them, and prize them as my best
friends.

Verse. 6 When their Judges are overthrown] As I like just reprehensions, so I
suffer unjust Persecutions from the Grandees of the Nation, who shall shortly
be dejected from their dignity, and dashed as it were against the rocks, And
then

They shall hear my words] The common people that have been seduced by their
evil Rulers to think the worst of me, shall be brought to a right
understanding of things, and undeceived: so that they shall set by those words
of mine that they have vilipended and slighted.

Verse. 7 Our bones are scattered at the graves mouth] i. e. I and company are
in a dying condition, free among the dead; yea, if taken we should be put to
most cruel deaths, Non una and simplici morte contenti sunt.
hewn in pieces, or pulled limbmeal, and left unburied; and our dead bodies
mangled by a barbarous inhumanity, as wood-cleavers make the shivers fly
hither and thither. This is the perilous case of me, and my partisans.

Verse. 8 But mine eyes are unto thee] Afflictions to the Saints are tanquam
scalae and alae, to mount them to God.

Leave not my soul destitute] Ne exinanias, make not bare my soul viz. of thy
protection.

Verse. 9 Keep me from the snare, etc.] See Psalm. 140.5.

Verse. 10 Let the wicked fall] Metaphora a piscibus, says Tremellius, as
fishes in casting-nets, Isa. 19.8.

Whilst that I withal escape] The Righteous is delivered out of trouble, and
the wicked comes in his stead; Prove. 11.8. It appears at length that simple
honesty is the best policy, and wicked polity the greatest simplicity, and
most self-destructive.

PSALM. CXLII.
WHen he was in the cave] scil. Of Engedi, 1 Samuel 24. Loquitur in spel^^ca,
sed prophetat in Christo, says Hilary.

Verse. 1 I cried unto the Lord with my voice] scil. Of my heart, and more with
my mind than mouth: for if he had been heard, he had been taken by the enemy.
Thus Moses cried, but uttered nothing, Exodus 14.15. Egit vocis silentio, ut
cord clamaret. Aug.
Thus Christ cried, Heb. 5.7.

Verse. 2 I poured out my complaint] Heb. My m^ssi^^tion.

I showed before him] Plainly and plentifully, how my danger increased to a
very Crisis, as one expresses it.

Verse. 3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within mee] Or, covered over, with
grief, as the Greek expounds it.

Then thou knew my path] scil. That I neither fretted nor fainted: Or, thou
knew how to make a way to escape, 1 Cor. 10.13. The Lord knows how to
deliver his, 2 Pet. 2.9.

Verse. 4 I looked on my right hand] Not a man would appear for me. (...),
misery is friendless for most part. See a Tim. 4.16. Nulla fide^ (...) delegit
(...).

Verse. 5 I cried unto thee, O Lord] I ran to thee as my last refuge, in the
fail of all outward comforts, Zeph. 3.12. they are (...) afflicted poor people;
and being so, they trust in the Name of the Lord.

Verse. 6 (...) Vat.
6 For I am brought very low] Exhausted and (...) dry, (...) and disabled to
help my self any way.

Verse. 7 Bring my (...) of prison] (...). Out of (...) less straitened than if
in prison.

The Righteous shall compass me about] Heb. Shall Crown me: that is, shall
incircle me, as wondering at thy goodness in my deliverance; or they shall set
the Crown on mine head, as the Saints do likewise upon Christ's head ( Cant.
3.12.) to whom this Psalm may be fitly applied all along, as abovesaid.

PSALM. CXLIII.
Verse. 1 Hear my prayer, O Lord] He prays once and again for audience: De
^ug^ ab Absalom. R. O. (...).
and would have God to hear him with both ears. Thus he prayed (says the
Greek title of this Psalm) when his son Absolo^ was up in arms against him; and
it may seem so, by the next words.

Verse. 2 And enter not into Judgment with thy Servant] This is, (...), siqua
usqua^ in sacris literis extat (says Beza) an excellent sentence as any is in
all the Bible, saying the same that St. Paul does, Romans 3.24. that
Justification is by faith alone, and not by works. David would not be dealt
with in strictness of justice. Lord go not to law with me, so some render it:
Go not into the Judgement-hall, so the Chaldee. All St. Paul's care was, that
when he was sought for by Gods Justice, he might be found in Christ, not
having his own righteousness which is of the law, etc. Phil. 3.9. The best Lamb
should be slaughtered, except the Ram had been sacrificed, that Isaac might
be saved. Woe to the life of man, says an Ancient, though never so
commendable, if it should have Judgment without mercy; if there be not an
(...) to moderate that (...), the severity of utmost right. We read of a
certain Dutch Divine, who being to dye was full of fears and doubts. And when
some said to him, you have been so active and faithful, why should you fear?
Oh said he, the Judgment of man and the Judgment of God are different. Sorde^
in conspect^ Judicis, etc.

Verse. 3 For the enemy has persecuted my soul] Quasi rabiferali percitus, he
has raged unreasonably. The utmost of a danger is to be related before the
Lord in prayer, and to be acknowledged after we are delivered out of it, by
way of thankfulness.

Verse. 4 Therefore is my spirit over-whelmed] Gods dearest Children have their
passions: against that stoicall apathie. A sheep bitten by a Dog is no less
sensible of the pain thereof than a Swine is; though he make not such an
outcry.

Verse. 5 I remember the days of old] Wherein I was delivered from the Lion and
the bear; yea from the hand of all mine enemies, and from the hand of Saul,
Psalm. 18. title. More than this, Sacula antiquitus praeterita recolo, I run
over, and ruminate all the ancient monuments of thy mercy to the Patriarchs
and others: since all that is written was written for our instruction, that we
through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope, Romans 15.4. See
Psalm. 77.4, 6.

Verse. 6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee] As a poor beggar for an alms.
Beggary here is not the easiest and poorest trade, but the hardest and richest
of all other.

My soul thirsts after thee] And is therefore a fit subject for thy Spirit of
Grace and comfort to be poured upon, Isa. 44.3. and 55.1.

Verse. 7 Hear me speedily] A very patheticall prayer uttered in many words to
like purpose; as the manner is, in extreme danger.

My spirit faileth] I am ready to sink and to swoon. This David knew; God has
a great care that the Spirit fail not before him, and the souls which he has
mad^, Isa. 57.16. When Bezoard-stone is beaten, we see that none of it be
lost; not so when ordinary spices: so here, for ordinary spirits God cares not
much what becomes of them, as he does of the choice spirits of his people.

Verse. 8 Cause me to hear -- in the morning] Man^, id est nature, as soon as
may be, or (at least) as is meet, make me to hear of joy and gladness, speak
comfort to my conscience, and help to my afflicted condition.

Verse. 9 Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies] Deliverance from enemie^ is a
fruit of our friendship with God.

Verse. 10 Teach me to do thy will] Orat nunc pro salute (...), says Kimchi.
Now he prays for his souls health; and would be as well a clivered from his
corruptions within, as from his enemies without. Lord save me from that
noughty man my self, said an Ancient.

Thy Spirit is good] The fruit of it is in all goodness, and righteousness, and
truth, Ephesians. 5.9. and it is the Spirit only that quickens, Job. 6.^3. by
purging out the dross that is in us, 1 Pet. 1.22. setting us to work, Ezekiel.
36.27. helping our infirmities, Romans 8.26. stirring us up to holy duties,
partly by immediate motions, and partly by the ministry of the word made
effectual, 1 Pet. 1.2. and 2 These. 2.13. And lastly sanctifying the offering
up both of our selves and of our services to God, as the Altar sanctifies the
gift, Romans 15.16. Cyrill gathers from this Text, that the good Spirit is God,
Per viam planam and aequam.
because none is good but God,

Into the land of uprightness] Or, On ^even ground, as Isa. 26.7, 10. Psalm.
26.12. (...) the right land, i. e. Heaven.

Verse. 11 Quicken me O Lord] Who am no better than a living carcass, a walking
sepulcher of my self.

Bring my soul out of trouble] I can bring it in, but thou only can bring it
out.

Verse. 12 Cut off mine enemies] Because not so much mine as thine; and those
also implacable and irrecoverable. Elsewhere he says, Slay them not, lest my
people forget. See the Note there.

For I am thy Servant] See Psalm. 116.16. with the Note.

PSALM. CXLIV.
A Psalm of David] The Greek adds, Against Goliath: And the Chaldee for the
hurtful sword, verse. 10. has Goliahs sword.

Blessed be the Lord my strength] See Psalm. 18.1. and observe how this Psalm
suiteth with that.

Which teaches my hands] Used to the hook and harp, and not to the sword and
spear: but God has apted and abled them to feats of arms, and warlike
exploits. It is God that gives skill and success, says Solomon, Prove. 8.
wisdom and ability, says Daniel, chap. 2. And as in the spiritual warfare,
so here, our weapons are mighty through God, 2 Cor. 10.4. who promises that no
weapon formed against his people shall prosper, Isa. 54.17.

Verse. Genebr.
2 My goodness and my fortress] See Psalm. 18.2. with the Notes, His epithet is
and elogiis eblanditur Deum, (...). Thucyd.
says an Interpreter.

Who subdueth my people under mee] This is the work of God and not of
Kingcraft, to make men good subjects, who are naturally discontented at the
present government, be it never so good, and apt to rebel.

Verse. 3 Lord, what is man?] What am I that thou should do all this for me?
or, what is the strongest man alive, when such a Giant as Goliath so suddenly
and easily is slain by me?

That thou make account of him?] Tantus tantillos, and tales says a Father.

Verse. 4 Man is like to vanity] See Psalm. 39.6. and 62.9. Adam Abelo compar
est, Adam is Abels mate.

His days are as a shadow] Which is a mere privation, and has no subsistence
at all.

Verse. (...).
5 Bow thy Heavens, O Lord] Come to my help suddenly and seasonably, as it
were out of an Engine.

Touch the Mountains] These high and haughty enemies of mine, do thou but
lightly routh them, and it shall suffice; they shall soon burn, and be turned
into smoke as the mountains that are thunderstruck.

Verse. 6 Cast forth lightening and scatter them] All this was done according to
David's desire, Psalm. 18.13, 14. God sometimes answers his suitors, ad
cardinem des^d^ri^: and says unto them, Be it unto you even as ye will. This
is a wonderful condescension.

Verse. 7 S^^d thine hand from above] Heb. Hands. both hands, all thy whole
power; for I need it.

Verse. 8 Whose mouth speaks vanity] They keep touch no further than will
serve their own turns.

And (...)] No though they give their hands upon it that they will keep (...).
Multis annis (...) tra^sa^^is,
Nulla fides est in pactis.


Verse. 9 I will sing a new song] Upon the receipt of any new mercy, like as in
a lottery, at every new prize drawn, the trumpet sounds.

Verse. 10 It is he that gives salvation (or victory) to kings] Ferdinand,
Balth. Ex^^^. Val. Max. Christian. p. 516.
King of Arragon, sending his son against the Florentines, thus bespake him:
Victoria mihi creed, non hominum disci^^^^is aut industria camparatus, sed Dei
O. M. (...) arbitrio, De^^ igitur inprimis cole, in cum confide, a qua tum
victorias (...) quaeque provenire dubi^ procul est, etc. Believe me, son,
victories are not gotten by art or industry; but given of God.

Who delivers David his servant] All Kings are Gods servants for the common
good of mankind, says Plutarch: but David by a specialty. Plut. (...).


From the hurtful sword] Of Goliath, says the Chaldee; and of all his other
enemies: for (as it was said of Queen Elizabeth) he swam to the Crown thorough
a Sea of sorrows, and might rather marvel that he was, than muse that he
should not be, were it not that Gods holy hand had protected him beyond
expectation.

Verse. 11 Rid me and deliver mee] He repeateth his former petition, verse.
7.8. for an utter riddance of those ill members that stood in the way of
Isreal's welfare; and broke off David's new song or Psalmody, verse. 9.

Verse. 12 That our sons may be as plants, etc.] As young plants, fair and
flourishing.

That our Daughters may be as corner stones, etc.] Tall and trim comely of
person, and costly-arrayed; resembling the polished-pillars at Palace-gates.
Tremellius renders the last words of this verse, (...) structura Templi, may
be the building of the Temple, that is, may be such living stones as may be
used to the building and polishing of Gods Church, that we may altogether grow
up to an holy Temple in the Lord, Ephesians. 2.21. and 4, 12, 13. For indeed what
can better preserve Jacob from confusion, or his face from waxing pale, than to
see his Children, the work of Gods hands, framed and fitted for Gods building.
This makes religious parents to ^anctifie Gods name (as here) even to
sanctify the holy one, and with singular encouragement, from the God of
Israel, Isa. 29.22, 23.

Verse. 13 That our garners] Heb. Our co^^ers; i. e. that every corner of our
houses may be filled with precious and pleasant riches.

That our sheep] Faetosae multiparae, mill cuplantes, myriadificantes.

Verse. 14 Nor going out] viz. To encounter the enemy, or to be led into
captivity.

No complaining] No out cries but Harvest-homes.

Verse. 15 Happy is the people] That has such a confluence of outward comforts.
In Hezekiahs days only it was so, say the Rabbines, peace, plenty, and
posterity. The Syriack renders it question-wise, Is not the people happy that
is in such a case? No: not except they have God to boot: as if they have, they
are happy howsoever, Deuteronomy. 33.29. ^^ vita carnis anima est, ita beatitude
hominis Deus, says Austin.

PSALM. CXLVI.
David's Psalm of praise] Heb. David's praise or hymn, well worthy, says learned
Beza, to be made use of by all men for a rule and pattern of praising God.
Perfectum illi^s rationalis culms exemplum. Beza. Kimchi. R. Arama.
It is one of those Psalms that are artificially made up after the order of the
Alphabet: and so highly prized by the Rabbines, that they doubt not to promise
Heaven to him who shall thrice every day pray over this Psalm, cord, ore, and
opere.

Verse. 1 I will extol thee, O God, my King] i. e. O Christ the King of Kings,
whose Vasall I profess my self; as did afterward also those three most
Christian Emperors, Constantine, Valentinian and Theodosius.

Verse. 2. Every day will I bless thee] No day shall pass me without a morning
and evening sacrifice; besides what is more, upon all emergent occasions. The
Jews have above an hindered Benedictions which they are tied to say over every
day; and one among the rest, for the benefit of Evacuation; it I were a
Nightingall (says Epictetus a Heathen) I would do as a Nightingall; In Encher.
but since I am a man, what shall I do? I will praise my Maker, and never cease
to do it: I exhort also all men to do the like.

Verse. 3 Great is the Lord] See his greatness set forth by Moses, Deuteronomy. 10.17.

And greatly to be praised] viz. According to his excellent greatness, Psalm.
150.2. which yet cannot be.

And his greatness is unsearchable] Tantum recedit quantam capitur, says
Nazianzen. He is above all name, all notion, all parallel in nature: we can
see but his back-parts and live; we need see no more that we may live.

Verse. 4 One Generation shall praise thy works to another] Gods praises are
many, and man's life short, and one Generation succeeds another: let them
relate Gods wonderful works one to another; and so perpetuate his praises to
all posterity.

Verse. 5 I will speak of the glorious honour] Or, I will meditate of the glory
of the honor of thy magnificence. I will discourse of those high and
honorable conceptions that I have of thee, which yet words (how wide soever)
are too weak to utter, such is thy transcendent excellency, and surpassing
glory.

And of thy wondrous works] Wherein thou art in some sort to be seen, as the
beams of the Sun are made visible by reflection; and letters, being refracted
and broken, in a pair of spectacles, are made legible to a dim eye.

Verse. 6 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts] Those that will
not talk of thy bounty, shall be made to say, O the severity of God!

Verse. 7 They shall abundantly utter] Eruct abunt, as a fountain casts out
waters plentifully and constantly: so shall those that are like-minded to me
abundantly and artificially (even with songs) set forth thy goodness and
faithfulness; saying, and singing,

Verse. Beza.
8 The Lord is gracious, etc.] See Psalm. 86.5, 15. and 103.8.

Slow to anger, and of great mercy] De quo penc possi^ amb^gi sit ne ad
irascendum tard^or, an ad parcendum promptior.

Verse. 9 The Lord is good to all] And of this he has not left himself without
witness, Act. 14.17.

And his tender mercies are over all his works] Holding the whole Creation
together, which else (by reason of the curse for man's sin, hurling confusion
over the World) would long since have been shattered, and dissipated.

Verse. 10 All thy works shall praise thee] i. e. Minister matter of thy praise.

And thy Saints shall bless thee] viz. Upon that account. If it were not for a
few Saints on earth, God should lose his glory here, in great part.

Verse. 11 They shall speak of the glory] That Kingdom of the Saints of the
most high, which is far beyond the Grandeur, and splendor of all the four
great Monarchies, as is to be seen, Dan. 7.27.

Verse. 12 To make known to the sons of men] This is the end why the Church is
collected, and the Gospel preached. God aims at his own glory in all; as
well he may, since he has none higher than himself, to whom to have respect.

Verse. 13 Thy Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdome] It cannot be over-turned
(that is comfortable to all Christ's subjects) as other flourishing Kingdoms
are; which have their times and their turns, their rise and their ruin.
Alexanders Kingdom continued but twelve years only; and fell with him: so did
Tamberlains greatness.

Verse. 14 The Lord upholdeth all that fall] None of his subjects can fall below
his helping-hand, his sweet supportance.

And raises up all those that are bowed down] Either with the burden of sin,
or misery in any kind. Camden.
Alphonsus King of Arragon is famous for helping with his own hand one of his
subjects out of a ditch. Of Queen Elizabeth it is recorded to her eternal
praise that she hated (no less than did Mithridates) such as sought to crush
virtue forsaken of fortune. Christ bruiseth not the broken reed, but upholdeth
it; he quenches not the smoking wick, but cherishes it.

Verse. 15 The eyes of all wait upon thee] Heb. Look up with hope to this great
housekeeper of the World. The Elephant is said to turn up the first sprig
toward Heaven when he comes to feed. The young Ravens cry to God for food,
Psalm. 147. at least by implication.

Their men] Suitable to their several appetites.

Verse. 16 Thou openest thy hand] With Kingly munificence.

And satisfiest the desire] Or, Of thy good pleasure thou satiatest.

Verse. 17 The Lord is righteous in all his wayes] This we must hold for an
undoubted truth; though we see not always the reason of his proceedings.
Sinful men dare to reprehend oft-times what they do not comprehend.

Verse. 18. The Lord is nigh unto all those, etc.] He is ever at hand to hear
and help his faithful suitors and suppliants: these have the royalty of his
ear, free access, sure success.

To all that call upon him in truth] That draw near with a true heart, in full
assurance of faith, having their hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and
their bodies washed with pure water, Heb. 10.22.

Verse. 19 He will fulfill the desire, etc] Or, The will, the pleasure.
Beneplacitum.
Hence that bold request of Luther, Fiat voluntas mea, Let my will be done.
But then he adds, Mea, Domine, quiatua, my will, because thine, and no
otherwise. They that do the will of God, shall have their own will of God. See
1 John 3.22. The King can deny you nothing.

Verse. 20 The Lord preserves all them that love him] See Psalm. 91.14, 15, 16.
with the Notes.

But all the wicked] That love not God, but their base lusts.

Verse. 21 My mouth shall speak, etc.] This he had often before promised; but
ingageth again, that he may not start back.

And let all flesh] But especially men, good men: for high words beseem not a
fool. But it well becomes the Saints, to be thankful, Tertull.
nec servire Deo solum sed and adulari, as an Ancient speaks.

PSALM. CXLVI.
Verse. 1 Praise the Lord, O my soul] See Psalm. 103.1.

Verse. 2 While I live, I will praise the Lord] George Carpenter, the Bavarian
Martyr, being desired by some godly brethren, that when he was burning in the
fire he would give them some sign of his constancy, answered, Let this be a
sure sign unto you of my faith and perseverance in the truth, quod usque dum os
aperire, aut certe hiscere licebit, that so long as I am able to hold open my
mouth, or to whisper, I will never cease to praise God, and to profess his
truth. Id quod and fecit, Sculter. Anna^ dee. 2. p. 110^
says mine Author, that which also he did; and so did many other Martyrs
besides.

While I have my being] Either in this world, or in the next: for then also,
and much more, I shall praise God.

Verse. 3 Put not your trust in Princes] But in God alone; this being a
principal piece of his praise: it is a kind of setting the Crown on his head.
See Judge. 9.15. The word rendered Princes. signifies liberal, bountiful ones,
(...), so Princes would be accounted? but there is no trusting to them without
God, or against him.

Nor in the son of man] The arm of flesh. See Psa. 118.8, 9.

In whom there is no help] For themselves. says Aben-Ezra; much less for
others.

Verse. 4 His breath goes forth] It is but in his nostrills at best; every
moment ready to puff out: cease from him therefore, Isa. 2. Man, say the
Rabbines, Naz.
is but a bladder full of air, which can stand on no ground: but pricked with a
pin, it shriveleth to nothing. Man, says a Father, is nothing else but Soul
and Soil, breath and body; a puff of wind the one, a pile of dust the other, no
solidity in either.

He returns to his earth] Of which he was made, and to which he is
condemned, Gen 3. and upon which he has too much set his affections, being
totus terreus, and so the sooner forfeiteth all. It was therefore good counsel
that One once gave to a great man, who had showed him his stately house and
pleasant Gardens. You had need make sure of Heaven, my Lord, or else, when you
dye, you will be a very great loser. But this, few Princes think of; which
made the Spanish Friar say, there were but few Princes in Hell; for why? there
were but few in all.

In that very day his thoughts perish] His golden thoughts, his white-shining
thoughts, irritae diffluunt, come to just nothing. Princes may happily have in
their heads whole Commonwealths, and the affairs of many Kingdoms; as
Alexander had, and Tamberlan, who dyed of an ague in the midst of his great
preparations for the conquest of the Greek Empire. Or, his thoughts ( ad (...)
benefa^iend^s, as Aben-Ezra expounds it) of doing thee and others good; these
fall to the ground with him. Great men's words are like dead men's shoes, says
one; he may go barefoot that waits for them. Wherefore

Verse. 5 Happy is he that has the God of Jacob for his help] Since he is the
King immortal, all-powerfull, as verse. 6. and no less willing, since he is a
God in Covenant.

Whose hope is in the Lord his God] This is a well-grounded hope indeed, and
such as will not drag after a man. The Leper believed Christ's power, Lord if
thou will, thou can make me clean. Martha believed his will to rail her
dead Brother, but doubted of his power; since he had now been four days in the
grave. He that is confident of both, is upon sure-ground, and happy indeed.

Verse. 6 Which made Heaven and Earth, etc.] And therefore can help doubtless.

Which keeps truth for ever] And therefore will: since he will not suffer his
faithfulness to fail, not alter the thing that is gone out of his mouth, Psalm
89. And this forever is opposed to that mortality and mutability of earthly
Princes, Verse. 4.

Verse. 7 Which executes Judgement] Vindicat violatos. This should draw custom
and company about him; as all that were in distress fled to David, and he
became their Captain.

Which gives food to the hungry] As he did to Eliah by the Ravens; to
Hunniades by his Shepherd, with whom he supt on course fare, and found it
sweet; to the Town of Rochel by a shole of fish extraordinarily cast up into it
by the tide, when they were straightly besiedged and distressed.

The Lord loses the prisoners] As he did Peter, Act. 12. and still he
knows how to deliver his, says the same Peter, who could speak it by good
experience, 2 Pet. 2.9.

Verse. 8 The Lord opens the eyes] Both of body and mind, as in the Gospel.
As for those miracles which Facitus and Suctonius attribute to Vespasian (as
that he made a blind man see with spittle, healed another that was lame, and
another that had a dry hand, by treading upon it) they are the miracles of
Christ, which those profane Authors would cast upon their Emperor. Tacitus
writes that the blind man said to Vespasian, that the god Serapis sent him to
him. Now the Paynims did think that the Christians did worship Serapis, as
appears by the Epistle of Adrian the Emperor to Severianus the Consul, that
in the Town of Alexandria, they that worshipped Serapis were Christians, etc.

The Lord raises, etc.] As he did that Daughter of Abraham in the Gospel,
whom Satan had bound and bowed down twelve years, Luke 13.16. and as he does
still, Isa. 61.1.

The Lord loves the Righteous] And this is more than all the rest. God
dispenses outward blessings, but not always in love.

Verse. 9 The Lord preserveth] These all are his clients, because neglected by
the World, as yielding no profit.

He turns upside down] As one does a dish that is washed, and wiped, 2 King.
21.13.

Verse. 10 The Lord shall reign for ever] Non sibi, sed in salutem nostram, for
our sakes he reigns, that he may execute Judgment, give food, loose
prisoners, open eyes, etc. Supplices idem, ti^idosque terra
Erigit v^ltus, and hon^r^ donat.


Therefore trust in him, and Him alone, and that way praise him.

PSALM. CXLVII.
Verse. 1 It is good to fing praises] For 1 Hereby we glorify God, Psalm.
^^.23. and so do him right; for he is the proper object of praises, worthy
only to be praised, Psalm. 18.3.2 Hereby we do good to our selves, secure
former favors, which else we forfeit, and procure further blessings, which
else we forestall. Hereby also were make things good in themselves, to become
good to us.

For it is pleasant] A very foretaste of eternal life; hence so many of David's
Psalms are eucharisticall.

And praise is comely] No fairer sight than to see Gods Altar covered with the
calves of our lips, and our selves in our Priestly robes, giving thanks to his
name, Heb. 13.15. professing our no-deserts, and whole-dependence upon him. As
on the contrary, an unthankful man is an ugly il-favoured Spectacle.

Verse. 2 The Lord does build up Jerusalem] He is the only Architect of his
Church. He lays the foundation of it in election (says a good Expositour)
and builds it progressively by faith and sanctification; and finisheth his
work of grace, and his peoples happiness, in glorification.

He gathers together the outcasts of Israel] He will surely bring home his
banished; yea, because they called thee an outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom
no man seeks after, therefore I will restore health unto thee, etc. Jer.
30.17. Qui nil sperare potest, desperet nihil.

Verse. 3 He heals the broken in heart] Pouring the oil of his grace into
none but those broken vessels.

And binds up their wounds] As a good Shepherd, Zech. 34.4. that good
Samaritan, Luke 10.34. and as a good Surgion deals by his patient. But let no
man ever think that God will lap up his sores before they be searched, or scarf
his bones before they be set.

Verse. 4. He tells the number of the stars] Which to man is impossible,
1322. Alsted. Encyclop.
as Aristotle maintains against those Astronomers, that tell us they are a
thousand and some hundreds. But Abraham was a great Astronomer; yet he could
never do it, Magir. Phys. lib. 2. cap. 5.
Genesis 15.5. and the wiser sort of Astrologers have rightly distinguished the
stars into numerable and innumerable, as to men.

He calls them all by their names] As knowing exactly their nature; and
authoritatively commanding every of them to do his pleasure. How much more can
God cull together his outcasts, and cause them to return; especially since he
calls those things that are not as if they were, Romans 4?

Verse. 5 His understanding is infinite] Heb. Of his understanding there is no
number; for he knows not only the kinds and sorts of things, but even the
particulars, though they exceed all number. Sic spectat universes quasi
singulos; sic singulos, quasi solos. That Philosopher did not say nothing, who
being in danger of Shipwreck in a light starry night, said, Surely I shall not
perish, there are so many eyes of providence over me.

Verse. 6 The Lord lifts up the meek] This truth was well known to the very
Heathens, who have said the same thing; as Herodotus in Poly^nia, Euripides in
Hera, and Esop being asked by Chil^ (one of the seven wise men of Greece) what
God was doing? answered, He is humbling the haughty, (...).
and exalting the lowly.

Verse. 7 Sing unto the Lord] Heb. Answer, that is, sing by turns, as Hos.
2.15. Deuteronomy. 31.21. Or, answer Gods goodness by thankfullness and obedience.

Verse. 8 Who covers the Heaven with clouds] as 1 King. 18.45. and still, as
there is need. It is not by nature, or hap-hazard, as men are apt to dream, and
are therefore so often told this truth, and admonished, that the second causes
do but serve the divine providence, in these common occurrents.

Who prepares rain for the earth] Rain (which is nothing else but the flux of
a moist cloud, out of the middle Region of the air) as it comes by a decree
of God, Job 28.26. so it is wholly at his dispose when and where it shall fall
even to a drop, Amos 4.7.

Verse. 8 He gives to the beast his food] See Job 39.3. Psalm. 104.27, 28. with
the Notes.

And to the young Ravens which cry] By sending flies into their mouths as they
cry, say the Rabbines: or by a certain moist air, as Euthymius: or by small
worms put into their mouths, mag^^ providentia symbol^, though they be such
contemptible creatures and very carnivorous, by reason of the vehemence of
natural heat in them, so that a little will not satisfy them, yet God feeds
them. See more on

Verse. 10 He delights not in the strength of (...) horse] Plutarch in Nu^^
says the (...) (...), God ^areth (...) for horses, or any such helps as
wherein carnal people confide, as if they had no heed o^ God. Ori^^^ observes
that in the conquest or Canaan, the enemies had horses and Char^ets, but Israel
had none. And it is expressly cautioned that the King of Israel shall not
multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end
that he should multiply horses, Deuteronomy. 17.16. least they should occasion him,
or his people to trade with that Idolatrous people 1 King. 10.26.28. or to
trust in the number and strength of that warlike creature, an horse, Prove.
11.31.

He takes not pleasure in the legs of a man] How swift soever, as Achilles,
(...), or Asabel, as light of foot as a wild Roe, 2 Samuel 2.18. None sooner
perish in the waters, nor oftener, than those that are most skillful in swimming
and diving; because they do too much trust to their skill^ so it is here; for
there is no out-running of divine vengeance. Nemo soelus gerit in p^ctore qui
non idem Nemesin in tergo; your sin will find you out. Here the (...) is not
to the s^ift, nor the battle to the strong, Eccles. 9.11.

Verse. 11 The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him] That put themselves
into the hands of Justice, in hope of mercy. These are his Hephzibah's, his
darlings in whom he takes singular delight and complacency. Me^^^^; habere
queis bon^m;
Et esse ^or^^lis datum est.


Verse. 12 Praise the Lord O Jerusalem] Whatever the World does, let not the
Church defraud God of his due praises: though thou Israel play the harlot, yet
let not Judah offend, Hos. 4.15. Gods blessings go round about graceless and
ungrateful people; and they are no more moved than the earth that has the
circumference carried about it, and it self stands still: But the Saints must
be of another alloy, Col. 3.15. and there is good reason for it.

Verse. 13 For he has strengthened the bars, etc.] So that the gates of Hell
shall not prevail against them. God has promised to break in pieces those
gates of brass, and cut in sunder those bars of Iron (as Sampson did the gates
of Gaza) Isa. 45.2. to perfect, stablish, strengthen and settle his Saints, 1
Pet. 5.10. to be a wall of fire, round about them, etc.

He has blessed thy Children within thee] Making them to be many, Isa. 54.1.
and all taught of God, verse. 13. children that will not lie, Isa. 63.8.

Verse. 14 Who makes peace in thy borders] Peace, peace, Isa. 26.3. peace of
Country and of conscience.

And fills thee with the finest of the Wheat] Heb. With the fat of Wheat
called fat of kidneyes of Wheat, Deuteronomy. 3^.14. See Psalm. 81.16. Judaea was once
called and counted Sumen totius terrae. not so much for the nature of the
Country, as for the blessing of God thereupon; for now it is nothing so
fruitful. But the Saints have still the bread of Angels, a feast of fat things
full of marrow, of wines on the Lees well refined, Isa. 25.6.

Verse. 15 He sends forth his Commandment, etc.] He speaks the word, and
it is done immediately: he can make a nation to conceive and bring forth all
at once, Isa. 66.7, 8. Ahash^erosh had his ^osts to carry abroad his edict: God
needs none such: all creatures are at his beck and check.

Verse. ^ellera nivis ^rg. Georg.
16 He gives Snow like W^^^^] For whiteness, lightness, plenty, softness,
warmth: for Snow, though it be very cold, yet by keeping in the vapors and
exhalations of the earth, it causes an inward warmth to it, and so makes it
very fruitful, say Philosophers. In which respects the Rabbines say that one
day of Snow does more good, than five of Rain.

He scatters the hour frost like (...)] When blown about by the wind. It
heateth also and dries (as ashes) the cold and moist earth, nippeth the buds
of trees, etc. ^mis monet ^em subesse ^^m fovea^.
Vnde (...) dicitur a (...), says (...).

Verse. 17 He casts out his Ice like morsels] Or, Shivers of bread. It is a
(...) saying, of One from this text. The lee is bread, the Rain is drink, the
Snow is wool, the Frost a Fire to the earth, causing it inwardly to glow with
heat teaching us what to do for Gods poor.

(...) Who can (...) it, when and where it is extreme especially; as in Russia,
Freesland, etc.

Verse. 18. He sends out his word and melts them.] See verse. 13. Of the
force of Gods word of command are given all the former instances. He can as
easily melt the hardest heart by his word, made effectual to such a purpose by
his holy Spirit. If that wind do but blow the waters of penitent tears will
soon flow as in Josiah, 2 Chronicles. 34.27. See Zech. 12.10.

Verse. 19 He shows his word unto Jacob] The Jews were Gods library keepers;
and unto them (as a special favor) were committed those lively and life
giving oracles, Romans 3.2. there is a chiefly set upon it: like as Luke 12.48.
to know the Masters will is the great talent of all other: there is a ( much)
in that.

His Statutes and his Judgments unto Israel] Even right Judgments, true (...)
good Statutes and Commandments, Neh. 9.13. See Romans 9.4, 5. Prospers conceit
was that Judaei were so called, because they received jus Dei, the Law of God.

Verse. 20 He has not dealt so with any Nation] He had not then; but now,
blessed be God he has dealt so with many Nations, in these last happy days of
Reformation, especially; wherein the knowledge of Gods holy Word covers the
earth, as the waters cover the Sea, and of England, it may be said as once of
the Rhodos, somper in Sole, situ est Rhodos, that it has the Sun ever shining
upon it. This we should prize as a precious treasure, and praise the Lord for
it, ^orde, ore, oper^.

And as for his Judgments they have not known them] And therefore lie in
deadly darkness; wherein though they wander woefully, yet not so wide as to miss
of hell.

PSALM. CXLVIII.
Verse. 1 Praise the Lord] And again Praise ye the Lord; and so often, in this
and the rest of the Halelujaticall Psalms; In praising God the Saints are
unsatifiable, and would be infinite (as his perfections are infinite) so that
they make a circle (as one phraseth it) the beginning middle and end whereof is
Halelujah.

From the Heavens; praise him in the heights] Or high places. As God in framing
the World began above, and wrought downward: So does the Psalmist in this his
exhortation to all creatures, to praise the Lord.

Verse. 2 Praise him all his Angells] Whose proper office it is to adore and
praise God. Job 38.7. Isa. 6.3. Heb. 1.6. which also they do constantly and
completely; as those that both perfectly know him, and love him. Jacob saw them
1 Ascending, to contemplate and praise the Lord, and minister to him, Luke
2.13. Dan. 7.10. Mat. 18.10. Psalm. 103.20. 2 Descending, to execute Gods will
upon men, for mercy to some; and for Judgment to others; which tends much to
his praise. And David, by calling upon these heavenly courtiers, provokes and
pricketh on himself to praise God.

Praise ye him all his Hoasts] i e. His Creatures (those above especially
which are as his cavalry) called his Hoasts for their 1 Number. 2 Order. 3
Obedience,

Verse. 3. Praise ye him Sun and Moon] These do, after a sort, declare the
glory of God, Psalm. 19.1, 2. Habak. 3.3. not with mind and affection, as if
they were understanding creatures (as Plato held) but by their light influences
admirable motions and obedience, whereby quasi mutis vocibus, by a dumb kind of
eloquence, In Epimeni^
says Nazianzen, they give praise to God, and bid check to us, for our dullness
and disorders.

Praise him all ye stars of light] A light then they have of their own
(besides what they borrow of the Sun) which they withold at Gods appointment,
Isa. 13.10. and influences they have which cannot be restrained, or resisted,
Job. 38.31, 32.

Verse. 4 Praise him ye Heavens of Heavens] Whereby he means not the lowest
Heavens, the air whereon we breath, and wherein birds fly, clouds swim, etc.
as some would have it; but the highest Heaven, called by St. Paul the third
Heaven, the habitation of the crowned Saints and glorious Angels; called by
Philosopher cal^^^ Empyreum, and hereby the Psalmist the Heavens of Heavens, as
King of Kings, song of songs, etc. by an excestency. See Deuteronomy. 10.14.

And the waters that ^ee above the Heavens] i. e. Above the air, and that do
distinguish betwixt the Air and the Sky, as the (...) does betwixt the Sky, and
the highest Heavens. Superius supensae aquarum forni^


Verse. 5 For he commanded and they were (...)] His (...) only made all; this
is celebrated by that heavenly quite, Rev. 4.11.

Verse. 6 He has also established them for ever] viz. The course and appointed
motions of the Heavens which he has settled by a Covenant; and has not
falsified with them, Jer. 33.25. much less will he with his faithful people.

Verse. 7 Praise the Lord from the earth] The Psalmist proceeds to factour for
God among the inferior creatures; beginning with the lowest in the waters
beneath, as the Dragons o^ great whales; and then coming to Rain and Snow,
etc. which are made out of the waters above.

Ye Dragons and all deeps] Of Sea-Dragons. See Aelian. lib. 4. Animal. cap.
12. they live partly in the Sea, and partly on the land, as do Crocodiles.
These also yield matter of Gods praise.

Verse. 8 Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapour] This latter is the matter of those
former meteors, which he purposely mingleth with those forementioned miracles
of land and waters, the more to set forth the power of God, because these seem
to have no setledness of subsistence, and yet in them he is made visible.

Stormy winds fulfilling his word] The winds blow not at random, but by a
divine decree: and God has ordered that whether North or South blow, they
shall blow good to his people, Cant. 4.16. He says to all his Creatures, as
David did to his Captains concerning Absalom, Handle them gently for my sake.

Verse. 9 Mountains and all hills] These praise God by their form, hugeness,
fruits, prospects, etc.

Fruitful trees] These, by the variety of their natures and fruits, do notably
set forth the wisdom, power, and goodness of the Almighty; whilst they spend
themselves, and the principal part of their sap and moisture, in bringing
forth some pleasant berry, or the like, for the use of man; who is thereby
engaged to bless God.

Verse. 10. Beasts] i. e. Wild-beasts, that are fullest of life; and there-hence
have their name in the Hebrew tongue.

And all Cattel] Domestic and tame beasts, even to the Elephant; which is said
to turn up the first sprig toward Heaven, in token of thankfulness, by a
natural instinct, when he comes to feed

Creeping things] Whether in earth, or Sea; all these are summoned in by the
Psalmist, to pay their tribute of praise, and to do their homage to the most
high.

Verse. 11 King of the earth] These are doubly-bound to God (as Queen Elizabeth
wrote to the French King) first, as they are men; and next as they are so great
men: Leunclau. Annal. Turc.
But this is little considered. Tamerlan having overcome Bajazet, asked him
whether ever he had given God thanks for making him so great an Emperor? who
confessed ingenuously he never thought of it.

Princes and all Judges of the earth] These are thrice called upon, because
hardly persuaded to pay God his rent, as holding themselves too high to do him
homage.

Verse. 12 Both young men and maids] Souls have no sexes; let the choice youths,
and the count lasses qu^ tot^ occupantur in sese ornandis, says Kimchi, who
are much taken up in tricking and trimming themselves, leave that folly, and
give glory to God.

Verse. 13 Let them praise the Name of the Lord] Join in this harmony of
Halelujah.

His glory is above] Being deeper than Earth, higher than Heaven.

Verse. 14 He also exalts the horn] i. e. He graceth them singularly.

A people near unto him] And in that respect happy above all people on the
earth, Deuteronomy. 4.7. and 33.29. because in Covenant with him, and near-allied to
him, as the word here imports.

PSALM. CXLIX.
Verse. 1 Praise ye the Lord] See Psalm. 148.1.

Sing unto the Lord a new song] A new-Testament-song, of a new argument, and
for new benefits by the coming of Christ, whereof this Psalm is prophetical.
Old things are past, all things are become new, 2 Cor. 5.16. new Commandments,
new promises new sacraments, new grace, new praises, new privileges.

For the Congregation of the (...)] His (...), whose join praises must come
before him as the found of many waters: this is Heaven upon Earth.

Verse. 2 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him] And new made him, Ephesians.
2.10. and thereby highly advanced him, as 1 Samuel 12.6. The Hebrew has it, In
his makers, to show the Trinity of persons, concurring in the work both of
creation and regeneration. So Genesis 1.2^ Job 35.1^. Isa. 54.5. Eccles. 12.1. See
Psalm. 100.3.

Be joyful in their King] i. e. In Christ, whose Kingdom is such as should
swallow up all discontents, and make us everlastingly merry, Mic. 4.9. I^
Seneca could say to his friend, Polybius, Fas non est salvo Caesare, de fortuna
tua queri. (...) salvi tibi sunt tui, etc. It is not fit for thee to complain
of thine hard fortune, so long as Caesar is alive, and well: how much more may
it be said so to Christians, so long as Christ is alive, and reigns?

Verse. 3 Let them praise his name in the daunce] Or, with the pipe, tibi is and
tympanis and omni musices organicae genere, by all lawful means possible.

Verse. 4 For the Lord takes pleasure in his people] Psalm. 35.27. when they are
under the Cross especially, and thereby meekened. This, the very Heathen saw,
Lib. de provid. 2
and could say, Spectant Di^ magnos viros, cum calamitate aliqua ^oll^ctantes.
E^ce s^^ctaculom, ad quod respiciat operi suo intentus Deus, says Seneca of
Ca^^, and other gallant Roman spirits. How much more may we say the like of
Gods-looking with singular delight on Abraham ( Jehova ^ire^, the Lord sees,
Genesis 22.14.) Job, Stephen, Laurence, and other faithful Martyrs, suffering
courageously for his truth, and ^ealing it with their blood?

He will beautify (or glorify) the meek with salvation] i. e. Not only
deliver them, Mr. Bolton.
but dignifie them in the eyes of all, Psalm. 91.15. I will deliver him, and
glorify him. ^radford and such, we shall look upon, likely (says a grave
Author) with thoughts of extraordinary love and sweetness in the next World
through all eternity: as Bonner and such, with execrable and everlasting
detestation.

Verse. 5 Let the Saints be joyful in glory] i. e. In their glorious estate by
Christ, notwithstanding their present poverty. Let the Brother of low degree
rejoice (or glory) in that he is exalted, Jam. 1.9.

Let them sing aloud upon their beds] How hard soever: Act and Mo^^
as Philpot and his fellow sufferers did, when they roused in the straw. Jacob
had never more sweet intercourse with God, than when his head lay upon the hard
stone, at Bethel. Some by beds here understand the Temples and Schools. Confer
Isa. 57. Others render it, (...) de cubilibus suis, They shall sing aloud for
their beds, that is, for their sweet and solid tranquillity.

Verse. 6 Let the high praises (or the exaltations) of God be in their mouth]
Heb. In their throat. So Isa. 58.1. cry aloud; Heb. cry in the throat, set up
thy note. -- Sic clames, ut Stentora vincas.

And a two-edged sword in their hand] Such an invincible power shall the Saints
have, as whereby they shall subdue all their enemies corporal and spiritual.
See Heb. 14.12. Rev. 1.16. and 19.15. there was more than metal and form in
Goliahs sword, delivered by the Priest to David; whose arm was not so much
strengthened by it as his faith: so is every good Christians by that two-edged
sword of the Spirit: he may well write upon it as that renouned Talbot in the
reign of Henry the sixth did upon his sword, Speed.
in blunt and boisterous language, Sum Talbotti (this was engraven upon the one
side of the blade, and upon the other) pro vincere inimic^s (...). See a Cor.
10.4, 5.

Verse. 7 To execute vengeance upon the Heathen] viz. Upon a just calling, and
not for private revenge; yea that soldier can never answer it to God, that
strikes not more as a Justicer than as an enemy, be his cause never so good.
But that is the most noble vengeance that is executed upon men's lusts; whilst
they thrust the sword of the Spirit into the throats of them, and let out their
lifeblood. That Is a good sense that some give of these words, viz. that the
Saints when they go forth to battle, should go with holy songs in their mouths,
as well as with swords in their hands. See Judge. 7.19, 20, etc. Ussier. Brit.
^cles. ^mord.
and 2 Chronicles. 20.21, etc. the victoria Hallelujatica, was got on this manner
here in Britain, under the conduct of Germanus, against a mighty army of
Pelagian Picte and Saxons. This was the course and custom of the (...) in
(...) against their Popish persecutors; and the like we read of the other
French Protestants at the siedge of (...), that I mention not those gallant
Spirits at (...) battle with their reboated, Now for the fruit of prayer;
together with the many Psalms sung by that religious army in their several
stations, whereof I have been an ear-witness.

Verse. 8 To bind their Kings with chains] Restraining their vices, and bringing
them to the obedience of faith; See Isa. 45.14. This is doubtless a desiteable
servitude, or rather freedom; this is not as chains and fetters, but as
girdles and garters, to gird up their loins, and to expedite their course the
better.

Verse. 9 To execute upon them the Judgment written] The Jews thought they
might kill any Idolaters; and now to kill a Christian is counted by them a
meritorious work. The wicked are apt to exceed their commission, Zech. 1.15. So
may the Saints. David was too cruel to the Ammonites, 2 Samuel 11. Theodosius to
the Thessalonians. Here therefore they are limited to the word written.

This honor have all his Saints] As having obtained like precious faith, 2
Pet. 1.1.

PSALM. CL.
Verse. 1 Praise ye the Lord] See Psalm. 148.1.

Praise God in his Sanctuary] It is probable, says Beza, that h^c Psalm^
mirifici ardoris plen^, by this Psalm which is so full of wonderful ardour,
the holy singers of the Sanctuary did mutually stir up one another to praise
the Lord. It has been noted before, that here we have in six verses twelve
Hallelujahs. Some by Sanctuary understand Heaven; Others, the hearts of
believers.

Praise him in the firmament of his power] Or, for the firmament wherein
appears his power, Psalm. 19.1. Or, for the Church, and the firmament of faith.

Verse. 2 Praise him for his mighty acts] Those wonderful effects of his
creative, and providentiall omnipotency.

Praise him according to his excellent greatnesse] Or, Greatness of greatness;
which yet can never be done, but must be endeavored. Propound the highest
pitch and best patterns.

Verse. 3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet] With all your might and
members, with utmost joy and jollity in the Lord. Lord I am a musical
instrument, says Nazianzen, Orat. de Basilio.
for thee to touch, that I may sound forth thy glory and praise.

Verse. 4 Praise him with the Timbrel and dance] Or, Pipe. But these are ancient
things (as it is said in another case, Justin. Ma^tyr. musices usum reprehendit
qu. 107. ad Orthodox. Sic Theodoret. lib. de sacrific.
1 Chronicles. 4.22.) and now out of date. When the use of these musical
instruments crept into the Christian Churches (which was not till alate
neither) great abuses crept in with it: the preaching of the word was changed
into songs and Anthems, little understood by those that sang them, and that
grave and simple Psalmodie or singing of Psalms (so much used of old, and by
this blessed Reformation restored to the Church) was justled out or rather
turned in turpissimum len^c^^ium (as one justly complains) such as
Nebuchadnezzar made before his golden image, Dan. 2. When Aristotle was asked
what he thought of music he answered, (...), nec cithar^^ (...); thinking it
an unprofitable Art to men, that was no more delightful to God. Plato told the
Musicians who pressed into his company, that Philosophers could do well enough
without them. There is (no doubt) a lawful use of music, and great power it
has to move men's minds one way or another, 2 King. 3.15. 1 Samuel 16.23. But in
Gods publick-worship it is dangerous to do any thing without his special
warrant, though we intend never so well in so doing as we see in Vzza.
Temple-musick was part of the Jewish pedagogie, of the leviticall-worship; and
therefore cannot be retained without injury to Christ.

Verse. ^^ Pison.
5 Praise him upon the loud Cymbals] These were, says Cicero, instrumenta
are^, (...) in matris (...) sacris usurpata: bells, some render it. The Apostle
speaks of a tinkling Cymbal; And a grave Divine complains, that God cannot
please some hearers, D. S^ough. ^^ 2 Timothy ^1.13. (...)
unless he speak tinkling and tickling words.

Verse. 6 Let every thing that has breath praise the Lord] Or, Let every breath
praise the Lord. T^^ Dei (...), says a Father: We have all as much reason to
praise God, as we have need to draw breath; our breath should be like the
smoke of the Tabernacle, or those pillars of incense therehence ascending (...)
renders it (...), Let the very whole soul of us praise the Lord,

(...) the Lord] The Psalmist had made an end, and (...) has (...). When (...)
said (...) utmost for Gods praise (...) must rest (...).
