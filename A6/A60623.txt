CHRISTENDOMS CALL TO REPENTANCE, Who is Adulterated, and gone out from the
Life of her Maker, and gone into the Spiritual whoredoms, from the Life which
was among the Apostles, which with the Light, is seen and made manifest, which
now shines, that comes from the Word which was in the beginning, before whom
all things are bare and naked, and nothing can be hid. By W. S.

LONDON. Printed, for Thomas Simmons, at the Sign of the Bull and Mouth, near
Aldersgate, 1661.

THis has been seen as the purpose of the Lord concerning Christendom, that
all her great build^ing which her builders have set up, not one ston^ shall be
left upon another, which shall not b^ thrown down; which the Papists,
Anabaptists, and others the professed Christians so called, or professors of
Religion, have been so long time and so many years building, contriving, and
setting up in the dark, out of the Council of the Lord; and their building
shall be laid waste, and trampled upon; and this the Lord will bring to pass
in the Earth, the day hasteneth a pace, and though they gather, they shall be
scattered, the Lord will scatter them.

For the Rams horns blowing, they shall not endure the blast thereof, Priests,
Professors, nor People (for the Spirit of life is therein) which have been
alienated from the life of Innocence, and the life of Righteousness, so
cannot endure the breath.

This is thy case, O England! and the Nations round about thee, Spaniards,
Dutch, French, Italians, Portugals, Scots, Irish, and others that have
committed Adultery with thee, and lain in the Bed of whoredoms together, which
are gone out from the light, gone out from the Husband, and so have defiled
themselves, whom God will judge.

Your stink is ascended, and the cry of your iniquities gone up into the ears
of the Lord of Sabbath, who will arise and plead with thee, O Christendom! in
one Nation and another, that have harloted from the life of thy Maker, and gone
after strange flesh, and from the life of the holy Apostles and Prophets, and
gone into the killing, devouring, and destroying one another; So that an utter
consumption is determined from the Lord to come upon thee, and the whole Earth,
which shall spoil your glory, and deface your beauty.

For what Fighting Quarreling, Striving, Tearing, Rending, has come up in
thee, thou Christendom, since the Apostles and true Christians days, killing
and destroying about Religion, Church, Worship, Ministry, and striving one with
another about their words, whose life you are Apostatized from, and so run unto
the carnal Weapons, which the true Saints, Ministers and Messengers of Christ
warred not with, who put on the Armor of Light; And since them the Wolf has
got into the Sheeps clothing, which is to be rent off, and thou stripped bare
and naked, and left to open view, and this the Lord is bringing to pass, whose
work thou can not withstand.

For all thy Threats, Bonds, Prisons, nor Arm of flesh will not terrify nor
hinder the birth born of the Spirit from doing the will of God; the corner
Stone is set upon thy head, and the little stone cut out of the Mountains
without hands shall fill the whole Earth, it shall bruise the feet of the Image
whereon the Image stands; and the most beautiful form whatsoever without
life, what is it more then an Image? So that nothing but life it self will
stand, and all likenesses will come to an end.

And Sion shall arise and shake her self out of the dust, and put on her
beautiful Garments which long has lain in the dust mourning, yea, thou
Daughter of Sion shall rejoice and break forth into singing, and the days of
thy Widdow-hood shall be ended, though thou be yet but small, and little, for
great is the Holy One in the midst of thee; thy gates shall no more be shut,
neither shall there be any night where thou inhab^^est, the Lord shall be thy
sure defense, and thy God thy glory.

But thou Christendom (...) from the life of God, which was among the Apostles,
shall weep and mourn, and all them that have committed lewdness with thee;
yea, who have been partakers of your pleasures together, shall weep and sorrow
together, the day hast^neth ^pace. And this is declared against Christendom,
the professors of Religion, and fighting Christians with carnal Weapons got up
since the Apostles days, thy Weapons cannot defend thee, nor be able to
withhold nor alter the determination of the Almighty; the Vials and Wrath that
is to be poured forth upon thee without mixture, who have sat as a Queen, and
said in thy heart, thou shall see no sorrow, which have lived in the many
mixtures, out of the simplicity, and out of the truth, and so out of the
service of the only true God, who is a Spirit and will be worshipped in the
Spirit and in the Truth, and so have grown subtle, lewd and stubborn,
clamorous; and to keep up thy false Church, and false Worship, have invented
Wracks, Tortures, Prisons, Inquisitions to torment and afflict others; So shall
thou know thy bed of sorrows, who being out of the Truth and Service of God,
have served the diverse lusts and pleasures, contrary to the Spirit, and
contrary to the Truth, which is the Light.

Therefore, O Christendom! consider what thou have brought up thy Children to,
and what thou art training them up in, that Christ's Voice have not heard nor
hear, so are running after the strangers, having itching ears, whose heart
is even surfeited with delights and pleasures, and drunk with the blood of the
Saints; But into a bed of torment thou must be cast, and thy companions with
thee, and bitter lamentation thou must know, who have lived in pleasures on
Earth, and been wanton, and faired deliciously every day Dives-like. thou must
also drink of the same cup which thou have filled unto others, which shall be
filled unto thee from the hand of the Lord who is Just and Righteous; And do
thou think that thy carnal Weapons will ever be able to defend thee, who have
committed spiritual whoredoms, and led many into captivity?

O* that the cup of the Lords fierce indignation thou can turn from, and not
drink of it, who have drunk the blood of his Saints, And the sons of Sion more
comparable then fine Gold, have trod under thy feet? Will not thy heart ache
think thou when thou shall drink it? and receive thy portion from the Lord,
which in one day will come upon thee, and them that have committed Fornication
with thee, whom the worthy Name of Christ have blasphemed, and called your
selves Christians, and caused his Truth to be evil spoken of, and his Name to
be blasphemed through thy lewdness, adulteries and whoredoms, who shall be made
bare and naked, and thy lewdness discovered, the Lord will bring it to pass,
and plead his cause with thee, who have the face of an impudent whorish woman,
hardened in wickedness and deceit; thy day of desolation and widowhood
hasteneth on thee, for strong is the Lord which will perform this; And have
called thy self a Church, and Church Members, and have told people out of thee
there is no salvation nor safety; and so have beguiled the unstable* But are
they in safety that are in the Adultery, Uncleanness, Defiled, where the
whoredoms have been committed, and the bed has been defiled? For what
whoredoms like it in the whole World that have been committed in thee, and have
brought up thy Children in, thou Christendom, adulterated from the life of thy
Maker, from the life of Righteousness, and the life of Holiness, and yet
tellest of thy safety, and that there is no safety out of this Church, who have
caused the Name of Christ to be an abhorring before men, and before Nations,
that have been any thing sober minded, or have had a search and inquiry after
him, after Righteousness, and after Truth; or to know of his ways, his
teachings, the beloved of the Father, whom the Soul loves, and so to know their
souls beloved, which thou have caused to be stumbled at and offended; And so
have caused the worthy Name of Christ to be as a byword among the Nations that
knows him not, and to be evil spoken of among the Gentiles. What stinks have
proceeded from thy Inquisitions, Wracks, Tortures, and Prisons, disjointing
men's bones, and burning their flesh about Religion, Church and Ministry; What
havoc has there been made in thee, O Christendom! and in all the parts
thereof, of the honest simple hearted Lambs of Christ since the Apostles days,
which is even dreadful to consider what a weight lies upon thee, what Tearing,
Rending, and destroying has been in thee and by thee of the harmless flock of
Christ; Where has been the like heard of among any people in any part of the
World, besides the like things that have been done in thee? So that the Name of
the Holy Child Jesus has suffered by thee which thou have blasphemed, who
never commanded to Wrack, Torture, Burn, Imprison, nor make Inquisitions, but
bid love Enemies; Neither did his Ministers, Messengers, or Servants give forth
any such command, but said overcome evil with good; And so have thou kicked
against reproof and hate to be reformed, but the Lords judgments will pursue
thee, who is just, and overtake thee, to recompense thee who is mighty, and the
stroke of his hand thou can not escape, nor withhold the fury of his
indignation (except thou repent) which will press thee down into the Lake,
where the Beast, false Prophet, and them that have committed lewdness with
thee are to be taken and cast in alive together; and thou the great whore
judged, that have stood up against the true Prophet, and rejected the Light and
Life of men Christ Jesus, at whose Name every knee must bow and Tongue
confess, through whom the sons of Adam driven out from God, must have their
redemption up to God again, who is the way, and there is not another; who took
not upon him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham, whom the Angels are
to worship, the Anointed of God, the Savior of mankind, the true Light of the
World, that lights every man that comes into the World, that all men through
him might believe and be saved; For he that believes is not condemned, but he
that believes not is condemned already, the Light is his condemnation; and who
comes to the light, obtains life, that life which has been Apostatized and
Estranged from since the Apostles days, which also is the salvation, to be led
out of darkness, out of sin and transgression, which has long reigned in
thee, thou Christendom, adulterated from the pure life the righteous life, and
holy life, that have revolted and gone backward into the uncleanness,
filthiness, deceit and unrighteousness, so that even the life of
Righteousness, Purity and Uprightness, is slighted by thee and set at naught,
and not accounted of; to do truth or speak truth, is accounted but a small
thing among the highest professors or people; to come to yea and nay in their
communications, or to the plain and proper language of the Scriptures of Truth,
Thou or thee to one, and you to many, or more then one, this plainness and
simplicity is even scoffed at by thee, and called Canting, clownish, or
Unmannerly, and thou art offended at it, and it is a strange thing unto thee;
So does it not show thy spirit to be another then theirs that gave forth
Scripture, that can not bear their language, nor use their manners, that bid
to speak truth every man unto his neighbor, and bow unto the Lord; but if thou
can not be flattered, complemented, or have the Hat bowed unto thee, does it
not make thee rage? And ar^ thou not disquieted at it? But was it so of old
among the Saints and Holy men of God, or in the beginning? Or does (...) not
show that thou art degenerated, the Heads, Rulers, Priest* and Teachers in
thee, that art so much offended at the plain and simple language? Or if the
reverence be not done thee with Cap and Knee, or Scrape with the Leg, accounted
rude and ill bred, or misbehaviour? Does not such a low thing as a Hat confound
both Magistrates and Ministry in thee, if that be not put off to thy Rulers and
Teachers, who would have their persons respected, and so lead people to commit
sin, Jam. 2. 9. Therefore is it not time for all sorts of people to consider
what they have been led into, and what has been your life all this while, who
are stumbling and offended that the plain, simple, and upright life thou can
not bear, nor the light endure, nor the language nor behavior of them that are
in it, but strikes, persecutes and imprisons them that cannot give thee
flattering titles, nor respect men's persons to commit sin, nor go out of the
doctrine of Christ who says, swear no^ at all; and such thou Christendom and
the ^^ofessors in thee cast i^to ^rison; Is not this thy work, and do thou
not expect for this thou shall have thy ward? And so in thy nakedness and
sinful estate, have thou not been sowing Fig Leaves together to hide thy
nakedness, and piecing the old garment, that the rent is made worse? but
verily it shall not cover thee, for the day is come about that thou must be
stripped and made bare, and the fig leaves nor yet the tree shall not stand any
longer without the fruit, and the old garment shall be torn off; For behold, he
comes and is come that makes all things new, a new Heaven and a new Earth,
wherein dwells righteousness, and a new seed; And this the righteous God
will bring to pass for his own elect seed sake, and is bringing to pass,
which cries unto him for its deliverance, Amen says my soul, hasten that day,
put an end of sin, and finish transgression; come Lord Jesus Christ, come
quickly, that victory over the Dragons power, Beast, false Prophet, and false
Church may be witnessed by each in particular, and over all in the general.

THE END.
