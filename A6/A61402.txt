AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH Of that Worthy DIVINE Mr. JAMES JANEWAY, Who Departed
this Life, MARCH the 16th 1673/4.
I.
FOr Caryl's Death scarce had I dried mine Eyes,
Loder, then Venning craved some fresh supplies:
Pierced at this News,
I straight began to muse,
And scarce for them an Elegy had bred,
But I Am informed, that Janeway's likewise Dead.
II.
Startled at this, like one that is Planet-struck,
All Signs of Joy forthwith my Face forsook:
The Characters
Of doleful Grief, and Fears
Were so engraven on my Heart, that I
Could not efface their Stamp, unless I Would dye.
III.
The eight parts of Speech, that always send Relief
Unto the Grammar, of a lawful Grief,
Breaking their hold
Passed free, and uncontrolled
Thorough my Mouth block't up almost with Sighs,
And barricado'd with dis-joynted Cries.
IV.
The Tears brought forth from my big-belly'd Eyes
Pickled my Face; yet this could not suffice.
Suffice? For what?
Guess you your selves at that:
For I Prognostic, If such Stars should fall,
Darkness would soon be Epidemical.
V.
No, he is not fallen, but is ascended higher,
And warbles out sweet Anthems in a Quire
Of Saints, that are
Joyful beyond compare;
Where stripped of 's fleshly part, his Soul's alive,
His Fame with us for ever shall survive.
VI.
Soaring aloft, he quite left the Earth, wherein
The Chequer-work of Sorrow and of Sin
Could not excite
His nobler Appetite
To taste this World, this bitter-sweet, once more,
Knowing 'twas rotten to the very Core.
VII.
Who ever saw him, and did not admire
To see that outward Harmony conspire
With such rare Art
In each agreeing part,
As if Dame Nature in's formation had,
To see her self outdo her self, been glad?
VIII.
Who ever heard him Preach, and did not wonder
To hear his threats against Sinners, which like Thunder
(The contrary
To Saints he would apply)
Struck a Convulsion through the Hearts of those;
That ( Balaam-like) would still Gods ways oppose?
IX.
In fine, all those that knew him must commend
That Virtue, which did always him attend,
And so appears
In the redoubled Sphere
Of Mind and Body, that, if you Virtue love,
Of him you must (for Virtues sake) approve.
X.
He was -- but hold, I cannot tell you what;
Sum all Perfections up, and he was that:
Whatever it is
That good, and worthy is
Of the most lasting and resplendent Praise,
Surely in him deserved a Crown of Bays.
XI.
It Is well for thee, but ill for us, blessed Soul,
That Death does among her Captives thee enroll:
Fain we would rejoice
In Heart as well as Voice
For thee; but for our selves we needs must mourn,
And drop a Tear at thy Religious Urn.
XII.
Our Faces are afloat, our Cheeks do swim
In briny Tears, wept for our selves, not him:
At some ones Hearse
I Have whilome wept a Verse
For fashion-sake, but now the Tears I shed
Flow from my Heart; Grief makes me likewise Dead.
