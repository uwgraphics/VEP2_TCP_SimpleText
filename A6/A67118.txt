LONDON, Printed by R. O. for F. W. MDCXLI.

THE SORROVVES AND SVFFERINGS OF THE MOST VIRTUOUS LADY ELIZABETH Queen of
BOHEMIA.
IF all the VERTVES which the Critticks call
VERTVES Divine, and VERTVES Cardinal,
If these together mixed with ROYAL BLOOD
Can scarcely make a Claim to merit Good;
If HER great Merits could not impetrate
So much, as not to be Unfortunate,
And in Misfortunes to exceed so far,
As if the worst of all her Sex She were:
How light would our best works be in Heaven's skale,
If She thus far in point of Merit fail.
Had She been Romes, her Supererrogation
Had been sufficient for the BRITISH Nation;
And would have made the Papal Sea as great
As Rome was, when it was Augustus Seat:
Who would not have a blessed Pilgrim been
Had he ere read the Story of this Queen?
Had not the Roman Doctrine been disputed
That others Merits cannot be imputed;
The Anti-nomists (though they are very loath
To trust to Works) their thread bare Faiths would cloth
In her rich Merits; so even they might hope
By Merits to be saved without a POPE.
The Character of Patience JOB even he
Must loose some glory, if compared with thee:
The Story of thy Sufferings who can tell?
This I dare say, it has no Parallel.
Thou were the Daughter of a mighty KING,
Great CHRLES his only Sister, and did bring
A Portion worthy the Imperial CROWN
Besides the greatest Portion was thine own.
'Twas for Thy sake the German PRINCES did
Set BOHEMS Crown upon thy Husbands head:
They saw good Queen thy Virtues were so great,
They would have placed Thee on the Imperial Seat.
All these Thou lost at once; that we may see
The Gods on Earth have a capacity
Of fatal change, that Kings and Queens may know
There are no fixed Fortunes here below:
Lord what a Sea of Princely Christian Blood
Has been powered out to make Thy TITLE good,
Thou and thy King with a distracted Train
Before Thy Foes fled and pursued amain*
Thy Husband banished from his Native Soil,
Friends, Cities, Country made a woeful spoil,
And sacked; the Plague, the Famine, Fire and Sword,
Were glutted all, Nature the sights abhorred:
Yet as enough thy patience was not tried,
Thy Gold in new Fires must be purified;
Thy firstborn Son which was the greatest loss
With Ayry Nails was fixed upon the Cross
T'wixt Heaven and Water, and the Vessel drowned,
There frozen to the Mast was next day found:
Then Swedens King that thunderbolt of war,
Who (had he lived) had been an Emperor
Had raised your Husbands heart, that he espied
Some glimmering hopes, and in that twilight died,
Before thou can recover such a Cross
Sad news was brought thee of another loss,
That great GVSTAVUS was untimely slain,
(As 'twas supposed with Pistols sent from Spain)
Whose Martial Soul not used to be said nay
In it is ascension got a glorious Day,
As in his Journey it the Plannets past,
'Twas so much honored, their great Mars at last
Began to fear, he could not choose but see
His Legends did incline to mutiny,
And joined together would a Council call,
To make that Spirit of his their General.
Never the Soul of any King ascended
Who had from Earth to Heaven bin more commended:
My Muse grows weary with this Tragic Story
(Nor could I force her) were it not her Glory
Whom it concerns; now to the last I come,
(So may it be) her brave Heroique Son
Whose sweetness here, had so much honor got,
Except the Queen, few have so great a Stock,
In Court and Country both, nor could I see
A kinder Father; saving Majesty,
Then our King was, and seldom have I seen
A kinder Mother then our virtuous Queen:
When this sweet Prince had here tried some few friends,
And had propounded to the King his ends;
He ^hips himself, needs but to hoyse half sail,
Left prayers and sighs should raise too strong a gale*
Words are but air, and prayers but words inform,
It Is but excess of Air that makes a storm.
Austria too long for Justice had been suited,
Their Cause must now with sharp swords be disputed.
Our Kings and they with Treaties were deluded,
Both she and hers by Act of State excluded
From all their rights; an Army then they raised
On such a sudden, it the World amazed;
He brings them to the Field, besieged a Town
Which to th'Imperialists was quickly known.
Two distant Armies correspondence hold,
Which made even both the Armies far more bold,
The lesser dares him out, keeps him in play;
Mean while the stronger marches night and day,
And got behind him, to his passage make,
Which with their Horse too strong for his, they take:
When the Prince saw his Army thus enclosed,
He called a Council; he himself supposed
'Twas best to charge those which the passage kept,
Which all agreed on, and before they slept,
They march away, though they were almost tired,
And overwatch't, their Frenches then they fired:
Into Brigadoes they their strength divide,
Flanker their Foot with Horse on either side:
Their strength was horse, their Baggage they enclose,
Guarded their Cannon; then he Craven chose,
And to his charge he did commit the Uan,
Who proved himself that day a daring man;
And showed himself so faithful and so bold,
His name is in the Book of Fame inrol'd,
He and his Brother did bring up the Rear,
Whose high-borne spirits did that day appear:
Craven charged home and did them so dismay,
But for their fresh supplies h'ad won the day:
The Battles join, th'Imperialists increast,
And as they grew, death had the greater feast
The rear came bravely up, the young Prince he
In thirst of honor, sense of injury,
Himself to such high hazards he exposed,
As he was often by his Foes enclosed:
Yet who enclosed him, or enforced his stay,
He by their ruins made himself still way*
But when Prince Robert the brave second Son
(Who amongst the Soldiers has such honor won)
Heard that his Princely Brother was engaged,
With love and Martial fury both enraged,
Through troops of foot and horse, he forced his way
And finds him freed, yet there he would not stay,
He forvvard pressed into the greatest throng
Of all his Foes; his sword there told his wrong*
He picked out their Commanders whom he knevv,
By marks were given him, those he took or slew;
Whole Troops of Horse and Foot his fury fly,
Those he encounters, must or yield, or dye:
'I was happiness to them who did command,
Since they must die, to die by such a hand.
His Horse, his Arms, his very Sword was tired,
That spirit of his twice Samsons strength required;
And would their Wagons with rich spoils have laded,
Nay all those Troops of German Horse have jaded;
And thus retired they block him up they say,
For none durst charge, 'twere thought the safest way:
Have you ere seen a chased Lion stand
With toils encompas'd, and on every hand
With Hunters galled; yet none the Lists dare enter
Left he too dearly pay for his adventure.
Whilst all the Hunters various vvayes contrive
To take this Lion (if they can) alive:
So galled and weary brave Prince Robert stood,
The earth about him died with German Blood;
At last a troop of desperate Men they horst
Who on all sides assault him; so infors't
With multitudes, when all the vvayes they would tried,
Thy took him living, who would feign have died:
Which news too soon did through the Army fly*
And that the Enemies had a fresh supply,
Who had encompas't them on every side:
In every face that after this news died,
He who had skill in Phisnomy might find
How to revenge the Soldiers were inclin*d:
It Is true they lost the day; but they behaved
Themselves so bravely, they their Honor saved;
The meanest Soldiers by example led
Mixed in Troops with Enemies lay dead.
The Palsgrave was adviz'd to quit the Field,
Which he refused, and scorned so much to yield:
Being rudely pressed he cuts himself away
Through all those Troops, none durst enforce his stay;
He to the Wesen comes, into it leapt,
Which him as safely as its Sovereign kept;
His sprightly Steed so bravely landed him,
As if he had great Neptunes Dolphin been.
It Is true the waves in multitudes increast,
And crowded in to welcome such a Guest*
Yet so obedient were to their commands
The proudest wave there durst but kiss his hands.
Thus landed safely on proud Wesens banks,
He lifts his eyes up, and gives Heaven the thanks;
With such a confidence to Heaven he prays,
H'ad Solomon blessings given, and length of days*
You who were once dear Wives* sad Widows now,
Mothers of Children, who have kept each row,
Either to Heaven, or to your Husbands made,
Think how the Queen was with this news dismayed*
But you were never Daughters to a King*
Nor did such Portions to your Husbands bring*
The Worlds great love to you has never cost,
It any blood you have no Kingdoms lost
No hopes of Empire; there is no Prince has tried
His forttune in your cause, no Kings have died
In your just quarrel, you have no(...) Estates,
Or if you have, not two Palatinates:
Your eldest Son was not in Shipwreck lost,
Nor was your second on the Wesen tossed;
Your third not taken prisoner by his Foes;
Had you all these, and not such sons as those;
How can you, or how dare you judge of Hers,
But as poor Vassals speak of Emperors?
They do believe at Court there are such things*
As they have heard, their Magistrates call Kings,
Like those that dare the Stars by name recite,
Or count by* Unites to an infinite:
They Are forced to end where they at first begin*
And so in arrogance commit a sin*
So should you rob this good Queen of her Glory,
But I much more in telling this sad Story*
In this I do but as most people use*
I with a greater wrong a less excuse,
That which my naked Muse should cover (Love*)
In this case does my disadvantage prove;
The World stands to affected to Her Story*
No Muse (I know) but would impair Her glory*
The Competition might grave Homer raise*
Or Maro's soul to sing the good Queens praise:
Who ere he be he needs not to complain;
For this high Subject will enrich his Strain,
And imp the proudest feather of his wing,
That with the Lark he may mount high and sing
Even to the admiration of the Quire,
Suit but the Subject, and none can sing higher.
FINIS.
