A Proclamation commanding all persons upon the Borders of England, to keep
peace toward Scotland, upon the like Proclamation by the King of Scots toward
England.
WHereas of late time there has been great disorders by Incursions into our
Realm of multitude of Scottishmen dwelling upon the Borders of our Realm
toward Scotland, committing both murders, taking of prisoners, burning of
houses, and taking of goods and cattle, whereof our Wardens have made
complaints to the opposite Wardens and Officers, and thereof the King of Scots,
our good brother has been advertised, and has answered, that he very
willingly would give order for redress thereof, And to that purpose has by
his Proclamation charged all his Wardens and Officers upon the Borders, and
other his Subjects whawtsoeuer, to observe and keep the peace, and in no wise
to invade, molest, or do any injury to any of our subjects, adding thereto
very honorable directions for observing thereof upon great pains, as by the
said Proclamation further has appeared unto us: He for our part being of the
same good mind for maintenance of common peace, do straightly charge and
command all our Wardens of the three Marches, and all other our Officers and
do straightly charge and command all our Wardens of the three Marches, and
all other our Officers and subjects within the said Marches, to live in peace
and quietness, and in no wise to make any incursion into Scotland privately or
publicly: But if any offense shall be done unto them it their bodies, lands,
or goods by any Scottish man, that then they forbear to revenge the same by
any open hostility, but make their complaints and pursutes to the opposite
Wardens, according to the laws of the Frontiers: And if redress shall not be
made unto them, then we will that our Warden, where the offense shall be
committed, shall give knowledge thereof to the King our good brother by our
Ambassador there resident, hoping thereby both that our Subjects damnified
shall be relieved, and the Kings Officers refusing to give Justice, shall be
chastised and corrected, the like whereof upon complaint of any Scottish men
against our Subjects or our Wardens, we mind to see severely redressed.

And though this present order now given by these our mutual Proclamations,
may by good likelihood stay any further disorders from this time forward, yet
considering the multitude of offenses, that have been committed by the Scots,
against our Subjects, is so great and lamentable for our Subjects to suffer,
either vnredressed (as far forth as the same may be) or unrevenged, as might
have been, if our subjects had not been prohibited to seek the same by
force: Yet we would have our subjects that have been so injured without
redress, to understand, that as the king of Scots offers to have
Commissioners authorized for his part to repair to the Borders, to meet with
some to be appointed by us, amicably and peaceably to hear the complaints both
of ours and his subjects, and to give speedy redress and satisfaction,
according to the laws and customs of the Borders, and agreeable with the
treaties of amity betwixt us and the said King, for mutual justice and
continuance of peace: so also we mean therein to do the like, and to make
choice of some special men of knowledge and good disposition to peace, to
repair to the Frontiers, and there to join with such as the Ring of Scots
shall appoint for his part: Willing and commanding our Wardens and other our
Officers in the mean time, to cause all persons subjects, having just cause of
complaint, and that have had no redress, to make ready their complaints in
writing, with the due proofs thereof, to be delivered to our several Wardens,
whereby the same may be in more readiness, to be heard and ordered mutually by
our said Commissioners. And this our commandment and determination we will
and command our Wardens to cause to be published in all places public within
their Offices, and like wise to give knowledge thereof to the Wardens opposite
of Scotland, and other public Officers upon the Scottish Frontiers, thereby to
move them to be correspondent in their actions, agreeable to this common
determination of us and the King our good brother.

Given under our Signet at our Manor of Greenewich, the xx, day of August in
the xxxviii. year of our Reign.
