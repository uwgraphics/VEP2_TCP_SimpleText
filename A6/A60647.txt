THe Day of Restoration's come;
the Lamb, the Life, the Holy One,
He is Establishing his Name:
Nations must bow unto the same.
The Heavens are old, the Earth is dry,
The Glory of Man must fall and dye;
His Leaf decays, his Blossom fades away;
He withers in the Night, and burns up in the Day.
The Fire will try his Root, and prove his fairest Branch;
And Root and Branch must burn, and none shall stop or quench:
The Old must pass away, and vanish out of sight;
The New must he set up, and shine in Glory bright.
Blessed is the Day.

TO THE READER
READER,
WHether thou art a Friend unto Truth, on an Enemy; or whether thou art a
Professor or Profane, a Cedar or an Oak, a flying Bird, or a ranting Spirit,
This following Truth, which in this Book is declared, may be of service unto
thee, if thou will but read it ^eekly and soberly; for it is given forth from
that Innocent Life that the Serpent did ever make war against; and for the
Innocents sake it is sent abroad, that the harmless Lambs may be preserved, and
also delivered out of the Net of the wicked Fowler, and from the Snares of his
Dark Devices: Therefore when thou entrest upon it, and undertakest to read it,
do it in the dread and fear of the Lord God, and sink into the lowness, and
feel Gods Witness in thy own Conscience, that thou may read, and also
understand; for it is Gods loving kindness unto thee, into whose hands it may
be ordered to be read or heard, and from the tenderness of Love it is
declared, and also sent abroad, that thou (whoever thou art) may reap some
profit by it; which thou will do, if thou read it in that good Spirit which
is given unto thee to profit withal, and unto which the truth of it is made
manifest, and keep down that evil spirit, against which it testifies; and
as thou keep to the Spirits manifestation in thy self, and in that read
it, thou will feel when thy Condition is reached, and when it is spoken unto;
and as it opens unto thy Understanding, put it not away from thee, but keep
quiet and be still, and let not Anger nor Envy arise in thy heart, which the
Serpent sometimes will provoke thee to; and if thou give way unto it, and
suffer it to arise, it will prevent thee for profiting, though thou may
read what is in this Book contained; but as thou read it in the Meekness,
and receivest it in the Love, from which it is declared, and for thy Good truly
intended, then thou will feel the weight of it, and reap advantage and profit
by it: and a^ thou read, consider what thou can witness of these things in
thy self that therein is declared, and in so reading or hearing thou will
profit, and Gods Witness in thy Conscience will awaken thee, and truly prove
unto thee what thy present state and condition is; and though never a
Scripture-Text be quoted for the proof of the Testimony, yet thou shall find a
proof in thee, which if thou mindest it, will not deceive thee, but will open
thy own Condition to thee, which will be better for thee than many Proofs
without thee, and in that thou will feel how far thou art come to witness
Redemption by the Power of Christ, or where it is the Serpent holds thee, and
what thou art yet in bondage to; and, as in the Light thou see it, then turn
to the Light, and deny it, that whatever it is, it may be judged, and upon the
Cross crucified, and in the Fire consumed; for through this Gate thou must
come, or out of Paradise thou art excluded, and from the Tree of Life for ever
fenced: and I having seen, and also observed how the World lies in wickedness,
and also, how many there be that profess Godliness, which when I consider and
see how few are regenerated and born again, I am even filled with grief and
sorrow; Therefore in true tenderness, and love, and bowels of pity unto all,
the precious Truth is declared as it is in Jesus; and also the secret workings
of the Serpent, that has always been a Deceiver: And thou may in this Book
behold things past, things present, and things to come, whereby thou may
understand the love that God has unto thee; and do thou yield unto the Lord,
that his Work thou may know, who will judge thy Lust, crucify thy Life, and
destroy the body of Sin, and so through Death, bring forth a new Life, in which
thou will feel a perfect Change wrought, from the earthly into the heavenly,
where thou will enjoy the Lord and his Presence, his Power and his Goodness,
and sit quietly in Joy, and Peace and Blessing:

CHAP. I. The State of Man in the Creation.
THe Lord God of Life and Power, who is from Everlasting to Everlasting,
according to the good pleasure of his own Will, and after the Counsel of his
own Heart, he brought forth a Pure Creation in his Wisdom, and by his Eternal
living Word he divided and separated the Matter, which in the Chaos was in a
heap of Confusion, and what he commanded by his Word, it came to pass, and as
he said it should be, so it was done; and in his Wisdom a Pure Creation was
finished, as he commanded; and when he had stretched forth the Heavens, and
placed the Lights in them; and when he had laid the Foundation of the Earth,
and brought forth the Herbs and Trees therein; and when he divided the Waters,
and the Fish multiplied in them; when the Fowls of the Heavens had their flight
in the Air, and four-footed Beasts, and creeping things, had their way upon the
Earth; then did the Eternal Word in the Wisdom, make Man in his own Image, and
breathed into him the Breath of Life, and he became a living Soul, and the Lord
God filled him with Wisdom and Understanding, and gave him Dominion over all
the Works of his Hands; and Man in the Wisdom of God ruled over them all, he
stood in the Wisdom, and received Counsel, and had his Way in the Holy Life; he
walked in the Paradise of Pleasure, and fed upon the Tree of Life; he lived in
still communion with his God, and his living Soul stood in his living Virtue;
and the Breath of Life was always reaching to it; he was in the pure Oneness
with God that made him, and the Image of the Holy Life was upon him, and he was
in the Power, Wisdom and Strength of God, and bare the Image in Righteousness
and true Holiness, without any mixture; and all things stood clear in the
Separation as they were created, and there was no mixture to defile: Then did
the Wisdom behold his Work, and lo, it was very good in his sight, and he had
great pleasure and delight therein, and his Mercy, Love, Goodness and
Tenderness was to it, and his Blessings and Peace was upon it; and Man enjoyed
the living Presence of his Maker, and did partake of his Love, Mercy, Blessing
and Peace; he had a free course unto the Wellspring of Life, and there was
nothing stood in his way to let him; so the Breath of Life was breathed, and in
it the Soul lived, and was in perfect unity with it; and this came into Man
through the Wisdom of the Creator, according to his own pleasure, and as it
seemed good in his own sight; it was not a thing from without, but the pure
operation of the Power and Wisdom within, after he had formed an earthly Body,
and brought forth a visible Creation, that he might fill it with his heavenly
Treasure, and with his Holy Life, which in his Wisdom he breathed into it, and
brought forth the Man in his own Image, and there was no mixture in his Life
and Being, which is the earthly bodies Nature, and it is a Compounded Vessel,
yet so prepared and formed in the Wisdom, as to be a Vessel for the
Incorruptible Image of Life, which had its course through it, and filled it
with its heavenly Being, and there was no mixture of the Earthly in it: And
this was the Man that was made after God in Righteousness and true Holiness,
and bare his Image in perfect Glory; and the Body was prepared to be a Vessel
fit for his own use who made it, that he might fill it with his Pure Holy Life,
which he breathed into it in his Wisdom, whereby Man became a living Soul, and
bare the Heavenly Image; and here Man stood in obedience to the Father of
Spirits, who had made him a spiritual, holy, righteous Man, and fed him with
spiritual holy Food; and Man had no will nor desire after any Creature, but
stood in the Eternal Will, and ruled over all the Creatures, and his desire was
to enjoy the Holy Life, in which he was generated and brought forth; and what
he desired to partake of in the Life, it was ministered unto him according to
the good Pleasure of the Creator, in whom he had his Life and Breath, and lived
in the pure Enjoyment of the Eternal Being, in which he was daily comforted,
and continually satisfied: and in this state no Sin or Evil was committed by
him, nor no Curse reached him, nor no Death was upon him, nor no Grave did hold
him, nor no Wrath went forth against him, but in the Mercy he lived, and Mercy
was his portion, and his delight was in his Maker, and with him he walked day
and night, and he had Liberty in Paradise without Restraint, and the Tree of
Life he had free course unto, and the Cherubims and flaming Sword were not set
to fence it; So was Man created in Righteousness, and served God in
Righteousness, and lived in the Life of Righteousness, and he was not in the
mixture of any Unrighteous thing, but was created in the Wisdom of God, and
bare the Image of God, which drew its Breath and Life from the holy Fountain of
its Generation, and stood in the Eternal Essence of the Divine Nature; and so
did the Everlasting God of Wisdom, Power and Strength bring forth his own Work,
in which his own Name was glorified, and then he rested from ill the Works that
he had made.

CHAP. II. The state of Man in the Degeneration, and also the Serpents Working.
When the Pure Creation was finished in the Eternal Power and Wisdom, it
rested in the Holy Order of Life, and was in the Pure Harmony and Oneness with
the Creator, and there should have rested in the Holy Order, and not have moved
^^t in the Power and Wisdom of Life; but there was a part which did not keep
its station, but moved out of the Wisdom, and wake the Order, and did aspire
toward the Equallity of the Holy Essence, for which cause it was cast down by
the Power, and driven into the lowest parts of the Creation, and was there to
have its place and habitation at the furthest distance from God; and his Anger
kindled against it, and he drove it down in his Anger, and his Wrath abides
upon it, and it is sealed down in the Anger and Wrath without recovery; and
this is the place of that part which kept not in the holy Order of the pure
Creation, but aspired to have been equal with the Power, and his name is
Serpent, the Devil, and his place is Hell, the bottomless Pit, where the
Almighty God exercises his Wrath, without ceasing; because through the
Aspiring, the Creation went out of its holy Order, in which it was created
good, and in which it should have rested with God, and have had its Order in
his Power and Wisdom; and when this Aspiring Part was cast down into the Lowest
Part, it became beastly, carthly, sensual and devilish, and was more subtle
than any Beast of the Field; and having now lost his place in the Pure
Creation, and cast down in the Separation, where the Almighties Wrath was
exercised upon him, without ceasing, and he was always in the Torment of the
Anger and Wrath, which sealed him down without recovery; then did he labor
with his Subtilty to draw out of order, that which yet did keep its station and
order, and to beget a motion out of the moving of the Power; and the Lord God
having given a Command unto Man in the day that he put him into Paradise, and
charged him, Not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, for in the
day thou eatest thereof, thou shall dye, says the Lord God; which the Serpent
knowing, and having in his fall seen through the Creation, he attempted the
Woman, because she was nearest unto Man, being given as one meet to be an help
unto him, and being also the weaker part of the Creation, and in his Subtilty
he tempted her to eat of the fruit of the Tree, that God had forbidden, and he
said unto her, has God said, ye shall not eat of every Tree of the Garden? and
the Woman said unto the Serpent, We may (...) of the fruit of the Trees of the
Garden, but of the fruit of the Tree which is in the midst of the Garden, God
has said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye dye. And
the Serpent said unto the Woman, Ye shall not surely dye; for God does know,
that in the day ye eat thereof your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as
Gods, knowing Good and Evil: And when the Serpent had entered the Woman with
this Temptation, and had drawn her mind to look at it; then she saw that the
Tree was good for food, and also pleasant to the eye, and to be desired to make
one wife, and she did take and eat, and did give also to her husband, and he
did eat: So through the weaker part of the Creation did the Subtilty work, and
thereby reached unto the strongest, and entered and prevailed with the
strongest, that the Creation moved out of the Power, and contrary unto the
Power; so the Power was transgressed, in which all should have rested, and not
have moved but in the Power, and the Creation went out of order; then Man fell
from the Power and Wisdom of the Creator, and hearkened to the Voice of the
Deceiver, and transgressed against the God of his Life, and so he became a
degenerate plant, and lost his Authority over the Creation, and became subject
to the Serpents subtilty; then was he driven out of Paradise, and was driven
into the Earth, where he became corrupted and defiled amongst the mixtures of
the Earthly Properties, and so lost the Heavenly Image in which he was created,
and an Earthly Image came upon him in the generation of the Serpents subtilty,
and the World entered into his heart, and from the foundation of it the Lamb
was slain, and in the World the Serpent seated himself, and exercised his
Power, and became a god of the World; and then the Tree of Life was fenced with
Cherubims and a flaming Sword, and what way soever Man turned in the Serpents
subtilty to have come and tasted of the Tree of Life, the flaming Sword turned
and met him; then the Serpent wrought deceivably, and began to generate in the
mixture of the Earthly Properties, into which Man was driven, and in which the
Serpent had got dominion over him, and in a moment all the Faculties and
Properties of Man changed, and he was suddenly turned from the Image of the
Heavenly, to the Image of the Earthly, and so he became an Earthly Man, with an
Earthly carnal mind, that was at Enmity with God, and an Earthly Wisdom sensual
and devilish, in which the Serpent stood exalted, and had dominion over Man,
that brought the pure Creation into Bondage, where it groaned and traveled in
pain; and here was the pure Creation lost, as it stood in the mercy and love of
the Creator, and it fell from the Mercy and Love, into the dark Mixtures, where
the Wrath is exercised, and so became a Subject of the Wrath, where the Curse
came upon him, and Death over-shadowed him, and Hell enclosed him, where the
Torment, Anguish and Pain is. Then the Compassion of the Eternal Mercy moved,
and the Love opened, and the Seed was promised, that should bruise the Serpents
Head, that had so betrayed and deceived Man, that Man therein might again be
recovered out of the dark Mixtures, where the Wrath is exercised, and be
restored into the Love and Mercy which he did partake of, and was his portion
in the pure Creation; and through the Serpents subtle working, the first holy
Image was lost, and a defiled Earthly Image came up, which marred the Beauty of
the Holy, and the mind that was gone into the Earthly could see no beauty or
comeliness in it, that it should desire it, so could never love it, but has
ever appeared at enmity against it; and the Earthly Image is most desirable to
the Earthly Mind, and appears most beautiful; and so the Rejoicing stands
in its like, whether it be Heavenly, or whether it be Earthly, and Man in the
Fall is in the Mixture of the Earthly part, where the Serpent has generated,
and also brought forth an Earthly Image, which has its nourishment from the
old Creation, and its vital parts have their course through the Mixture of the
Earthly Properties; and in the old Heavens and the old Earth Man has his way,
and the Earth is become his habitation and his dewlling place: And thus is Man
degenerated, and out of Paradise driven, and from the Tree of Life fenced, and
is become an Earthly man, with an Earthly Image.

CHAP. III. The state of Man in the Separation, and also the Serpents Working.
When Man had transgressed and sinned against the Power and Wisdom of God, and
was driven out of Paradise, and fenced from the Tree of Life, he became a
servant to the Subtilty, and followed his leadings downward, and turned a
Wanderer in the Earth, where the Serpent led him in dark corners, and in dry
paths; and Man being joined unto him, he became an Enemy unto God, and full of
Cruelty in the Serpents Enmity unto every thing that was good; and the
treacherous Enemy wrought deceivably to keep Man under his Dominion, into which
he had drawn him with his enticing temptations; and when any thing arises and
breathes toward the Lord, he stands ready with his devouring mouth to
swallow it up and destroy it; and he having the dominion over Man, he makes him
bow at his will, and with his subtle working, keeps him in the Earthly
habitations, and Earthly paths, into which he has drawn him, and there holds
him in the Separation from God that made him, and leads him about in the dark
Imaginations of the Earthly part, and there does beget and generate the things
that be evil and sinful; so that Man is become deformed, and has lost that
pure Image in which he was created, and is turned into the Serpents beastly
nature, and is acted and ordered by his unclean spirit, that brings forth the
deeds of darkness, and leads Man to commit sin with greediness; and Man
having lost the Authority in which he ruled over the Creatures, he is fallen
under the power of darkness, and the Serpent has weakened him, and set the
Creatures over him, and then leads him to commit evil in the use of the
Creatures, and Man's heart being run into them, and become subject to them, he
is taken Captive with them at the will of the Serpent; and hence it is that
Drunkenness and Gluttony, Pride and Covetousness is come to rule over Man,
and the Devil has him Captive in them, and he neither knows what to eat, nor
what to drink, nor what to put on, nor how much Earthly Substance to desire,
the Serpent has so drawn his heart to lust after Evil, and he is always
willing, but never satisfied, that when he has received sufficiently of the
Creatures for his present need, yet he lusts to receive more, and the lustful
desire still presses eagerly, not being contented with so much as is needful;
so a Man drinks in his need and is refreshed, but the Lust not being
therewith satisfied, the Devil provokes the Will to press after more, and when
Man gives way to the Lust, and follows the Lust, he follows the Devil who is
the father of it, and therein he serves the Devil; and being overcome with the
Lust, he is in bondage to it; and when the Will gets forth in the fleshly
liberty, the Devil puts it speedily forward into Excess, and Man's Lust is not
satisfied until he have received so much of the Creatures, as deprives him of
the right use of the natural faculties of the visible Creation, and turns him
wholly into the Serpents beastly nature, who in that state rejoices over him:
and here the Devil has his Dominion, and has brought Man under him, and under
the Creatures, which he had dominion over in the pure Creation; so the heart
lusts after Drinking until a Man be drunk, and lusts after Eating until a
Man be glutted, and that he does not know what to eat, and he is become a
servant to obey the Devil's movings, who leads him and acts him in those
things which he begets in him, and centring the mind downward he leads Man
in the lowest parts of the Earth, and there generateth a lustful desire after
Earthly things; so that Man coveteth after the Earth, and after the profits
that arise from it; and as it does increase, so the heart is more in love with
it, and the Lust eagerly pursues after more enjoyment of it; and this is the
Covetous man in his way, the Devil persuades him he has not yet enough; such a
thing he wants, and when he has obtained that, then the Devil has another
ready to present unto him, and he thirsts after that, and presses eagerly to
enjoy it, and there is no end of his lustful desire that runs in the
Covetousness; and hence arises all Deceit, Fraud and Guile, because the
Covetous desire in the Lust watches to improve it self, and to get some
advantage by it, so that one Man defrauds another, and cheats and beguiles one
another, because the lustful desire in which the Devil works, coveteth after
unlawful gain, thereby to be made Rich, and come into Esteem amongst Men, and
so to be set up in Honor and Dignity in the world; and when he comes so to be
preferred amongst Men, yet he is not contented, but lusts after greater
Honor, and still to be promoted and set up in higher Dignity; and here Man
comes into the Honor below, but does not understand the Honor that is of God,
and so is like the Beast that perishes; and this Honor puffs up the Man,
and exalts him in the Pride of his heart; and as the Earthly Substance
increases, so Man is esteemed and honored amongst Men, and the Rich are
preferred, and the Poor they are contemned and despised, and then the Rich
exercise Lordship over the Poor; and the Devil he works in the lustful desire,
to seek after Respect, and to be honored amongst Men, and in the (...) of the
People, and the heart it is puffed up with it, and if it be not given as he
expects it, then the Devil provokes the l^st to Anger; and here came in the
Respect of Persons, and ^ing, and Cringing, and Scraping, and putting off the
Hat (...) respect of the Person, who has made himself Rich by dis^st gain, and
is set up to rule by his Earthly substance, and (...) by the Power of God; and
this is the Generation of the Devil, as Man is in the Separation from God, for
in the beginning it was not so; and here Man is willing, and lusting, and
striving after Riches and Honor, and a worldly Glory, and all seeking who
should be greatest, and set up highest that they may rule over others; and when
they are set up, then they exercise Lordship over others, and expect Subjection
from all Men unto their Power; and when there is something that cannot bear
that, there the Devil works and provokes to Anger, and Envy, and Malice, and
Hatred, and Evil-will, because one he would be Ruler, and another he would not
be Ruled over; then the Devil works in the dark places of the Earth, and
there stirs up Cruelty one toward ^other, and sets one against another; and
neither he that Rules, nor he that is Ruled over, are contented with their
Places, but a strife there is who should be greatest; thence comes Wars and
Contentions, and destroying and killing one another, the Devil having Rule he
provokes man to be Angry and Envious, and Malicious, and generates in the
Lustful Will that seeks after Revenge; and this is the nurthering spirit,
that has its course through the dark places of the Earth, that is full of
Cruelty, and has drawn the mind of Man after him, and has begotten in him the
many Lusts, from which the many Sins and Evils do arise and are brought forth,
that are contrary to the pure God, who in the beginning made all things good;
and the Divil has generated in Man a Kingdom of Darkness, and there has set
up himself as a Prince, and in his subtilty rules over Man, and what he
wills in the Lust that is performed, and under his power is Man captivated,
and the many evils committed; and it is not so with Man in that state as it was
in the beginning, but the Serpent has deformed him, and has begotten many
lustful desires in him, and he eagerly thirsts after the visible part of the
Creation, whereby he has lost his Union with the pure Power and Wisdom of God,
in which he was created good, and is gone into the Corruptibles, and brings
forth corruptible deeds, which presses the pure Creation, and keeps it in
bondage, and daily increases the weight upon it; so that the Creation groans
and is in sore travail and pain, and the Devil and his work is come up over it;
so that Covetousness, Drunkenness, Gluttony, Pride, Envy, Malice, Wrath, Anger,
Evil-will, Deceit, Fraud, Guile, Truce-breakings, Falseaccusing, Incontinency,
Headiness, High-mindedness, Foolish Jesting, Idle Talking, Vain Communication,
Sco^ing, Reproaching, Reviling, Time-serving, Men-pleasing, delighting in
Sports and Pleasures; these are become the very Life of Man, and his Delight is
daily in them: which does separate him from the Enjoyment of the Pure God that
made him, who in his Wisdom made all things good, and there was no such thing
brought forth in his Pure Creation, but has been begotten by the Serpents
Generation, since Man's Degeneration, and are all come up since the beginning,
through the Devils subtle working, for he is the father of them all; and whose
life is in them, or whose delight is after them, they are his children, and are
separated from God, and alienated from his Life, and the good things they taste
not, but the streams of Gods pure Refreshings are dammed up, that they cannot
flow in their own course through the Veins of the pure Creation, to quicken the
Inner man, and raise it up, the Old man with his deeds stops it, and there is
Adam in the way, which is truly the first, and is lifted up in the Earthly part
of the visible Creation by the strength of the Subtilty; and stops the
flowings and course of the Invisible Love and Life of the Creator, in which Man
had his Communion and Satisfaction before Transgression.

CHAP. IV. The Way and Works of Man in the Separation, and also the Serpents
Working.
MAn having lost the Power and Wisdom in which he was created, and in which he
ruled over the Creatures, and being drawn downwards by the strength of the
Subtilty, he is degenerated from the way of Holiness and the works of
Righteousness, and is led in the paths of Darkness, and has his course in the
visible part of the Creation, and in the defiled way of his own Invention,
which is broad and leads him to Destruction; and in it he wills and runs, and
there the Serpent hastens him, and puts him forward speedily, that he may
not at any time stand still, lest he should consider the evil of his way and
turn from it, and here he leads Man in the Separation from God, and draws him
in the crooked path of his subtle devising, and then begets a Delight to
walk therein; so that Man's heart is variously affected with the diverse Objects
and Appearances that the Serpent presents unto him and affects his heart
withal, that his love and delight is wholly in them, so that he loves his
Pleasures and Profits more than God: and in what way the Serpent leads him, he
in his subtilty labors to make that seem right unto him, and drawe^h a
deceitful cover over them, so that many are blinded and do not see the thing as
it is in its filthiness; Hence the Drunkard says, My way is Love to my Friend:
and the Covetous man, My way is Providence and Carefulness; and the Proud man,
My way is fashionable and Comely; and the Deceiver, My way is Wit and Policy;
and the Foolish Jester, My way is Mirth and Gladness: So does the Devil lead
Man, and blinds his mind, that he cannot see wherein he is deceived, but
walks on and presses forward, until he come to the End, where the Pit is
prepared: and this is the broad way in which Man walks, and where he
satisfies the Flesh, with the Affections and Lusts; and all the evil things
proceed from the deceitful heart, where the Serpent has his generation, and so
comes Murder, Adultery, Covetousness, Drunkenness, Pride, Envy, Malice, with
all the things that'are Evil, which separates Man from God, and keeps him afar
off; and in this state no Man pleases God, nor none does good, for all his
works are brought forth from the strength and power of Darkness, who has his
course through the fleshly part, and in the flesh he generates a lustful
desire; and when Man joyneth unto the Temptation which the Serpent offers
unto the Lust that he has generated, then Sin conceives, and when Sin is
conceived, it is brought forth, then Death comes over Man, and here Sin
enters, and Death by Sin; for the Wages of Sin is Death; and as Man lives
after the flesh, he dies; for all his works are corrupted and unclean, and the
Pure God has no pleasure in them, but as Man walks in them he is under the
Condemnation, and the Wrath and Curse is upon him, and the Hand of the Lord is
against him; and whether it be Profaneness, or a Profession of Godliness that
rises from the Darkness, and has its course through the fleshly part of the
Creation, it is condemned and judged with the Spirit, and he that walks after
the flesh, and satisfies it in the Lust which the Serpent has generated,
whether it appear sinful, or have a show of Godliness, Death comes over Man in
it, and he dies because his doings are fleshly and carnal; and Death is come
over all Men, forasmuch as all have sinned; and whilst Man's way is in the
fleshly part, and his works brought forth in the lust of it, Death is upon him,
and he dies the same death as the first Man in the Transgression, and there is
no respect of persons, but he that sins without Law, he shall perish without
Law; and he that sins under the Law, shall be judged by the Law; so shall
every man's way and work be proved, and he will be recompensed according to what
he does; and he that sows to the flesh, he shall of the flesh reap
Corruption, and in that state he cannot inherit Incorruption; so that the
Drunkard, the Swearer, Liar, Proud, Covetous, Boaster, Envious, Wrathful,
Foolish Jester, Vain Talker, Whoremonger, Murderer, Deceitful Hypocritical
Professor of Godliness out of the Power of God, cannot inherit the Kingdom of
God, for they are in the unclean nature, and their way and works are in the
flesh; and he that lives after the flesh shall die, and cannot inherit the
Kingdom, but is in the Separation from God that made him, and in the
Uncleanness that cannot come to him, but must keep at a distance from him; for
Righteousness and Unrighteousness have no fellowship together, and with that
polluted garment Man cannot come into Gods pure Paradise, nor enjoy his pure
Presence, but is separated afar off from him, and there is plunged in woeful
misery, and groaning, and sighing in the lowest parts of the visible Creation,
where the Serpent is Prince, and rules over him; and as Man lives and walks
in the flesh, and brings forth the works of it, he is a degenerated man, and
is at a great distance from God, and the Earthly part is over, and makes the
Separation, and burdeneth the pure Creation, which is held in bondage, under
the Mixture of the fallen Properties that are out of order; and it is needful
that every man consider his way and his works, and in time lay it to heart,
seeing all have sinned, and none in Sin can be saved, nor none in the flesh can
please God, neither can flesh and blood inherit his Kingdom; and who live and
walk in it, are separated and afar off from God, where his Wrath is exercised,
and his Judgments executed, without respect of persons.

CHAP. V. What it is that does Convince Man of Evil, and also the Serpents
Working.
MAn being drawn into Disobedience through the subtle working of the Prince of
Darkness, he became a Transgressor of the Pure Power and Wisdom of the Creator,
and so went out of the Good, in which he was created, and went into the Evil,
by obeying the Tempter, and then did eat of the Mixture into which he fell, and
the Imaginations of his heart became evil continually; and the Evil wrought
more and more to get dominion over the Good; and Man being into the Mixture
fallen, the Evil prevailed, and Sin entered, and Death by Sin; so as all have
sinned, and are deprived of the Glory, and alienated from the Holy Life; yet
did the Seed retain its own pure holy quality and property, without any
mixture, and it was not extinguished in the Fall, but kept its purity, though
Man went from it, and did not abide in it, and the pure Light in its own
quality did shine in Man's Conscience, and was made manifest in the Eternal
Love, to convince Man of all his evil ways and works which he was fallen into,
and it did shine in Darkness, and discovered the deeds of Darkness, and
convinced Man of the Evil of them; so was Adam convinced that he had
transgressed, and he did himself: Cain was convinced that he had murdered, and
he cried because of his punishment: Saul was convinced of his Cruelty, and he
said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: and the Light of this Holy Seed
of Life shines forth in the Love, and is made manifest in the Conscience of
fallen Man, and is freely given of God unto him to seek him in his fallen
Estate, and it has its course through the properties of the visible Creation,
and searches out Man's Life and Treasure; and whatsoever the Subtilty has
drawn Man's Mind into, and begotten a Life in it, the Light searches to him,
and convinces and reproves him in his own Conscience, so that Man cannot hide
his secrets, but still he is found out with the searching Light; for it shines
in Darkness, though Darkness comprehend it not, and with its pure brightness
it does discover the deeds of Darkness, and also the Prince of Darkness, and
makes manifest his secret workings, and lets Man see that he is a Stranger unto
God, and an Alien from his pure Life, and is serving that spirit that is at
enmity with God; and it lets him see the evil works that he commits, and in
which he is an Enemy unto God: So has the Love of God been made manifest in
the Light of the Seed of Life, which through all Generations has been the
same, and with its pure quality it has found out the Enmity of Man's deceitful
heart, with all deceitful workings, and has brought hidden things to light,
whereby Man has come to see how his mind has been exercised, and after what
it has inclined, and after what his heart has lusted; and as at any time the
Lust has pressed unto Evil, and to follow the things that are Evil, the Light
has been near to convince Man of it, and to reprove him for it; and with this
Pure Light, which has had its course in Man through all Generations, has all
Evil Deeds been made manifest, and with the Light in Man's Conscience condemned,
and all the Good Deeds have been ju^^^ed and approved; and when Man has done
well, he has been accepted, but when he has done evil he has been judged;
and though the Subtilty, with his secret working, drew Man ^m his Rest in God,
and disordered the pure Creation, yet the ^^^ver and Wisdom preserved it self,
and retained its glori^^s Quality and Property without any Mixture, which has
^^s course through the Mixture, to find out Man again that (...) gone from it,
and is fallen into the Mixture: So does the ^^^d God wait that he may show
Mercy, and through all Generations his Mercy has been made manifest, that in
Mercy ^e might restore the Creation into its holy Order, and bring Man ^^^m
under the Power of Darkness, and set him free out of bondage, that no
Corruptible thing may abide upon him, into which he is fallen through
disobedience, but that it may be taken ^^ay and removed, and the Lamb quickened
and raised, who ^^^n the foundation of the World was slain, and that he may
^ome into his pure Dominion without any spot or blemish; for he (...) more pure
than to mix with any Corruptible thing, but the Cor^^ptible thing presses his
tender Life, and the weight of it he ^^areth, and in much patience he suffers
under it, the Just (...) the Unjust, that he may again bring Man unto God, and
re^^^e the Creation into its pure Order where it rested with God, (...) had its
motion in the Power and Wisdom of God; and this (...) Christ the holy Seed,
with whom the Covenant stands sure, ^^ed unto whom all the Promises are made,
and in him alone ^^^e Yea and Amen; and the Seed has been ever revealed, to
^^ite the Serpents head, and to destroy his work, and through (...) Generations
it has wrought through the fallen Proper^ies of the visible Creation, and has
found Man in all his (...)-goings, and in his secret walking in the paths of
Darkness; and it has ever made manifest the lustful desire, as it has at any
time reached forth unto the thing that is evil, and it has convinced Man in
his own Conscience when he has lusted after any evil thing; this it has done
in Generations past, and its pure property does not alter, and Man, through the
Convincement that reaches to him in the Light, is made a sensible Man, and in
his own Conscience knows that he should not do Evil, and he sees the Evil in
himself before he commits it, and as the Temptation prevails over him and
draws him, he sees that he approaches near unto the Evil; and so all Men are
left without excuse, forasmuch as Evil is made manifest unto them, and they are
in their own Consciences convinced of it, and see it before they do commit it;
and who run into Evil, or are found in the Evil, either in Thought, Word, or
Deed, they transgress against the Light, which from the holy Seed of Life
shines forth in the Love, to discover, and also to convince Man in his own
Conscience of the thing that is Evil; and Man is here in the Fall, where all
the Properties of the whole Creation are out of order, and his lustful heart
eagerly pursues those things that are Evil, and yet wherever he runs in the
Fall, or in what path soever the Serpent leads him, the Light does discover it,
and makes the Evil manifest in his own Conscience; so that the Drunkard is
convinced (...) is evil, as he is in the uncleanness of it, and that wh^ (...)
^vince him, is the Light in his own Conscience, and the Light which shows him
Evil, it is pure without any (...) of Evil: The Deceitful man is convinced that
he is no Just, and that which does convince him of it, is the Light of Christ
in his own Conscience; and that which lets him see that he is Unjust, is Just
and Holy: The Liar is convinced that his deeds are evil, and he sees it in
secret whilst he yet retains it in his breast; and that which lets him see it
in his own breast before it be spoken, and convinces him of it, is the Light
of Christ in his own Conscience; And that which lets Man see a Lie, and
convinces and reproves him in his own Conscience for it, that is true, and
there is no deceit in it, and it is made manifest to destroy Lies, and the
father of Lies; and there is not any thing that the Subtilty has generated, or
does generate in his deceitful working, but with the true Light, that
enlightens every man that comes into the world, his deceitful work is
discovered, and Man thereof convinced that it is evil; and the Serpents
deceitful working amongst the fallen Properties, in which he begets every
lustful desire, is with the Light ^ced, and the secret of his working made
manifest; for the ^^rpent has seated himself in the mixture of the Earthly
Cor^ible part, amongst the fallen Properties, and has his course (...) the
Darkness, and there generateth a deceitful heart, out of which proceeds all
manner of Evil that defiles the Man; (...) he has gendered a body of Sin,
which in the Corruptible ^perties he has begotten, and he has wrought
deceivably, (...) has drawn Man's mind after Sin, and has also begotten is
love and delight in it, and so provokes a lustful desire ea^ly to pursue it,
and yet it never can be satisfied in it; but (...) Man runs in this path of the
Serpents devising, and follows (...) in his leading, and lusts after his
Temptation, he dra^h a burden upon himself, and comes into much trouble, (...)
something there is underneath that groans with the weight (...) those Lusts and
Sins which the Serpent has generated into ^body; and this is a contrary
nature, and is not of the Cor^ible, but with the Corruptibles is oppressed and
burdened; (...) with those things that the Serpent has generated since the
^^ginning, and has drawn Man's life into, the whole Creation (...) put out of
its Holy Order, and travelleth in pain, and the (...) course of Nature is set
on fire, whereby Man is depri^d of that pure Understanding in which he was
created, and in ^ich he discerned through the Order of the whole Creation,
(...) had knowledge of it as it stood in the Power and Wisdom (...) God: And
though Man be thus far degenerated, and has (...) his Understanding that he
had in the Manhood, and that the ^pent has drawn him into the fallen
properties of the Corrup^le part of the Creation, in which he is become as a
Beast ^thout Understanding, and does not know the God of Power (...) Wisdom,
nor the Order of his Creation; yet in this dege^ed state in which Man is thus
separated and afar off from (...), there is a pure holy Seed abides within him,
which in its (...) Light and Brightness reaches unto Man's deceitful heart,
which the Serpent has begotten in him, from which the Lust ^seth and the Evil
proceeds; and with its Light and ^ightness it truly discovers all the Evil
that in the deceit^ heart is generated, and it does truly convince him of the
Evil, whether Thoughts, Words, or Deeds; and when the deceitful heart lusts
to Anger, and that Anger is kindled in Man's breast, with the Light it is made
manifest, and with the Light Man is convinced that he is exercised in the thing
that is evil; and whatsoever is of the Serpents generation, and has its
conception in the deceitful heart, it is with the Light found out, and there is
nothing can stop its course from passing through the fallen properties to find
out Man, who is become an evil-worker, and to convince him of all his evil
deeds; and Man cannot escape the Light, though he walk in the midst of
Darkness, and have his way in the dark places of the Earth, and tread in the
Serpents devised paths, and bring forth the works of his begetting; yet does
the Light find him out, and with it he is convinced, and it is in his own
Conscience placed, that all his evil deeds he may see, which from the
Corruptible part of the visible Creation do arise, which separateth him from
God, and keeps him in the alienation from the Holy Life.

CHAP. VI. How Man stands in a Convinced state, and also the Serpents Working.
When Man in the Fall is overcome of Evil, and that his deceitful heart brings
forth a birth of the Serpents begetting; the pure Light, which has its course
through the fallen properties, comes to him with a Convincement, and lets him
see that he is an Evil-doer, and that he is not exercised in the thing that is
good; and when the Light has thus found him out, and convinced him, it does
also truly and plainly discover unto him, that his way is not right, neither is
his doings approved of God; and if he go on without Repentance, he must perish:
and in the Light Man sees his Conscience defiled, that there is uncleanness
upon him, and that his heart is not upright, but deceitful; and Man will
acknowledge this in words, and say he has a deceitful heart, and many evil
things proceed out of it, and he is sensible of them; and as they are conceived
and generated in his heart; they are made manifest unto him, and he in his
Conscience is convinced that they are exceeding sinful: Many Man in his
Wickedness will thus confess, though he be wholly in the fallen properties
where the Devil rules over him, and acts and orders his mind at his will,
yet the Light reaches to him, and so far convinces him, as to confess he is
an Evil-doer, and a sinful man; and this Confession will the Drunkard make, and
the Liar and Swearer: And whatever Man is acted in by the Serpents Subtilty,
the Light does convince him of it, and brings him at some time to confess his
Wickedness; so that every Man is left without excuse before the Pure God, in
that he sees his Evil with the true Light of Christ, the Seed of God, which
passes through all the Properties of the visible Creation, and does make the
way of Darkness manifest: And this Light has been within Man ever since the
Breath of Life was breathed into him; and though the Fall came upon Man in the
Subtilty, and that he fell into the Mixture of the Properties of the visible
Creation, yet the Light which was breathed in the Life, whereby Man became a
Living Soul, it was not extinguished by the Fall, neither was its Property
changed by going into the Mixture, but it did retain its pure holy Nature,
though Man was enticed from it into the Mixture, where he entered into the Evil;
and this pure Light of Life has through all Generations been the same, and with
its searching quality it has found out all the Evil that Man has or does
commit, and has and does convince him of it; and what it was in the beginning,
it has never been changed in its Property and Quality, but has continued
pure, holy, righteous and meek, as it is at this day; and what is come into Man
since the beginning, that is not of its nature, but is contrary to it, that it
convinces Man of, and testifies against; and all the Devils works which he
has begotten in Man since the beginning, with the Light which was in the
beginning they are made manifest; and the Light was before Sin entered, and with
it is all Sin and Evil, which is the Devils work in Man, discovered and
reproved; And as the Serpent has got dominion over Man, and begets his evil
deeds in him; even so does the Light discover them, and lets Man in his own
Conscience see them, and the Light is in his own Conscience made manifest to
bruise the Serpents head, and to destroy his work: And this Testimony is sure,
though the Subtilty cannot receive it; and all that ever came to be acquainted
with the holy Seed of Life, they never testified of another thing, nor ever
preached another Gospel; so that the same Gospel that was preached unto
Abraham, has been and is the same through all Generations; and this pure
quality of the holy Seed does not cease from searching after Man, who into the
Mixture of the Properties is fallen, and there it does strive with him, by
convincing and reproving, that he might not there abide, but that he might
arise and follow it, and come to inherit the Life in which he was created good;
and this is the Love of God, which was, and is, and is to come; who would not
have any to perish, but rather that they would turn and live; and though his
Love be so freely made manifest, and has an universal course through all the
fallen properties, to find out Man who is there in the disorder, and walking in
his disorderly and unruly affections, which the Devil has begotten and
exercises him in; yet does not Man receive his Love in the tender of it,
neither turns at the reproof of the Light which from the Love is made manifest;
but he loves his evil deeds more than he loves the Light; so does not come to
the Life, but is held with the Serpents Subtilty in the Mixture of the fallen
properties, and there his delight is in Evil more than Good, for which the
Light condemns him, and the Evil-doer cannot escape the Convincement of the
Light for his Evil deeds, but whatever it is that he lusts after, and has a
life in, with the Light he is found out; and if it be never so secret, he
cannot hide it from the Light; and though the Serpent do beget and generate
many Evil things, and provokes unto Evil Concupiscence, and exercises Man's
mind therein, yet the Light does not cease to bear Testimony against Man in the
Evil, and to convince him of his Evil deeds: Hence it is that Man stands in the
Acknowledgement of his Sin and Evil, but not turning to the Light when he is
convinced by it, and does see his Evil in it, he still abides in the Evil,
which he sees to be Evil, and is convinced of it; and the Serpent having do^on
over him, works a persuasion in him, that the Light which convinces him is
not sufficient to save him, and thereby generates unbelief, and draws away Man's
mind for ^ding to the movings of the Light, or for waiting to know the
Operation of its Power; and Man regarding the Serpents Counsel, he is drawn
away from the Light, and can^^t believe that it is sufficient to save him; and
so Man does ^^t turn to the Light when he is convinced by it, because disbelief
has entered him, as to the sufficiency of it to do him good, and the Serpent
still holding Man under his power, ^e persuades him that the Light is but some
part of the named property, and so calls it a Natural Light, or a Na^al
Conscience, or the most Tender part of a Natural Man; and that it is not any
thing of God, neither can save or give Eternal life though it should be obeyed;
and it is but a deceived way, in which many poor deluded people do run rashly;
and it is not the Redeemer, nor Mediator, nor Intercessor; for that is proper
to the man Christ, that dyed at Jerusalem; and Man must place his Faith in that
very thing done, for Life and Salvation, or he cannot be saved; and if he do
but so believe, his sin shall not be imputed, though he live in it and do
commit it: This is the fair show of the Serpents likeness, by which he has
deceived many people, in begetting unbelief to the Light of Christ in their own
Conscience, that shows them Sin, and convinces them of it, and begetting an
Imaginary Faith, to be saved by the Man Christ that dyed at Jerusalem, though
in Sin they abide: and hence it is that Sin is showed, but not destroyed, which
Man seeing, the Serpent persuades him that it cannot be otherwise whilst he
bears the natural body; for Nature is prone to Sin, and none can be free from
it until that body be laid in the Earth: Thus the Serpent works Unbelief to
the Light of Christ in Man, and begets a false Faith to believe in Christ
without him, and not in any ways within him, for that is Delusion, says the
Serpent; and in the Serpents false Faith which he begets, Man believes that
though here in this World he sin out his time, yet hereafter in the World to
come he shall be saved: So the Serpents faith puts the day of Salvation afar
off, and draws Man's mind into disobedience and unbelief to the pure Light of
Christ in his own Conscience, which is Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, unto
all that believe in it; and it does search after Man, and convince him of his
Evil, that he might turn and live; but Man not obeying, he comes not to know
the Life and Virtue that is in it, neither to partake of the benefit of it, So
knows not the Man Christ that dyed at Jerusalem, nor his Life and Salvation,
his Mediation and Intercession, but abides in the Mixture of the fallen
properties, where he is a Corruptible Earthly Man, without any Change wrought
in him by the Power of Christ, whose pure Light is Incorruptible: and here Man
stands convinced with the Light, and sees the things that are Evil; but not
believing in the Light, which makes Evil manifest, he still abides in the Evil,
and is not converted.

CHAP. VII. How Man stands in a Converted state, and also the Serpents Working.
THe Pure Creation being in sore travel and pain, through the disorder of the
fallen properties, where the Serpent has seated himself over all that is
called God, whereby he keeps Man in the Alienation from the Life of God,
where Death's shadow is over him, and sore grief and pain upon him, which does
heavily oppress him, and make him go mourning day by day, so that Man comes
into a consideration of his state and condition; and as he pondereth in his
mind, a pure Light shines forth in his Conscience, that does discover to him,
at what a distance he is from the pure God, and how he is alienated from his
Life, and what a great body of Corruption there is within him, that causes his
separation from God; and when this is made manifest unto him, he is stricken
down in the sense of his misery, and is brought into waiting, to see if he can
meet with any thing ^elp him and relieve him, something he feels that cries
after God, which, with the body of sin, is separated from (...); and there is
an Enquiry made which way to come un^ him, and how to be freed from those
things that separate from him? and whilst the Earnest goes unto the Lord, the
^ight shines forth more and more, and discoveries are made, and Man in the
Light begins to appear unto himself to be ^eding sinful, and begins to
call in question many ^ngs that he has lived in; and the Light discovers them
(...) be of the unclean nature, and Man begins to dislike them, (...) he cannot
so delight in them as he has done in times (...), but begins to be serious,
and to wait in the Light which ^oth discover them, to see if he may be
preserved from ^em; for he sees them to be evil, and that they do defile (...),
and are an heavy burden unto him, and a sore weight upon him; and by attending
to the Light, and obeying the light which makes them manifest, he receives some
power against them, and begins to get some victory over them; and ^ough Man in
this state have little acquaintance with the light, yet there is a true turning
to it, according to the ^^nifestation of it, and the knowledge that is then
given by it; and so far a true Conversion is wrought, as Man turns ^^om the
Evil, unto the Light which makes the Evil manifest, and Man has forsaken much
Evil in obedience to the light; and has ceased from much Vanity that sometimes
^e has lived in, and departs out of the unclean path of com^on Profaneness;
and those things that once was lovely to (...), are now become loathsome; and he
cease from Drun^ness, and superfluities in Meats and Drinks, which he has
been accustomed to, and from Lying and Swearing, and ^gious Apparel, in which
he sometimes has lived with ^elighting; and that which works this Change,
and begets a Man some Moderation, it is the pure Light of the holy Seed, which
never had pleasure in Man, as he is exercised in the things that are evil; so
has it ever found Man out to convince him; and as he obeys it, there is a Cord
of Love ^ast about him, to draw him and convert him; and here the lord works
the Conversion, and Man is converted: and into this state have many come, who
with the Light have be^ convinced, and also from many evil and profane things
converted, and yet from the bands of death have never perfectly been loosed,
but have been still kept in the house of bondage, and the Serpent has wrought
deceivably to betray Man into another thing, and bath labored to lead him
forth into some Profession, where he walks like a Sober man, and a Moderate
man, to what he has been in times past, and he comes into a fairer show than
when he first lived in the common profaneness; and when the Serpent has drawn
his mind hither, and has brought him into some fair show of Godliness, and Man
sees that he is much reformed in his Evil ways and courses that sometimes he
walked in, he begins to neglect the Light in his own Conscience, and to follow
his Profession that the Serpent has drawn his mind unto, and has set up
without him, and Man draws his Contentment from what he professes, and with
this false Conception that the Serpent has generated in the Imagination he
has deceived many, and caused them to err from the right way; and Man has
gone from the Light after he has been convinced with it, and also turned from
many evil things by it, and has become the greatest Enemy to it; for it is the
hardest to renew such a man, who has been once enlightened, and for a time has
had some enclination toward it, and has known something done by it, and then
turns from it, he becomes the hardest and turns most against it, and quenches
and stops the power of it, that he comes not to be a Regenerated Man, nor to
know the New Birth born, in which the holy Order of the pure Creation stands;
but the Serpent has brought form his many Births and Likenesses, whose
deformity and impurity has marred the true Births Beauty, so as little
Comeliness has appeared in him that he should be desired; and here the many
Ways and many Religions are come up, and many things that are profane they
are denied, and the Scriptures they are professed, and with this fair show are
many satisfied; yet does the Light of Christ in Man's Conscience search after
him in ^his Professing-state, and though now it do not appear against him as a
Drunkard, or a Swearer, yet it appears against him as a Will-worshipper, and a
Time-server, and a Man-pleaser, and against his Double-mindedness,
Unstableness, and Hypocrisy, and with its pure quallity finds it all out, and
searches through the fallen properties, in which the Serpent generates his
profession, and brings forth the birth of it; and though there be a seeming
difference betwixt Profaneness and such a show of Godliness, their generation is
in the womb, and they receive their nourishment out of the mixture of the
fallen properties, which are in a Chaos of confusion, and is Mother, Mystery
Babylon, in which there is no true order; so that the Profaneness and the
profession of Godliness are both defiled, and with the Light that is pure they
^^e both condemned: This is truly the state of many, and thus far have many
come, and never could get further, who have taken up their Rest in the formal
Profession, where there is neither Relief nor Satisfaction, and have not
endured the ^^ght of Affliction after they have been enlightened, but have gone
from the Gate that is called Strait, which is near to the Pool of Healing, and
have not patiently waited until he has come to bid them take up their bed and
walk; they could not lie and (...), but have strugled away, though lame and
impotent, and have gone from the Gate, called Strait, and have stragled into
the way that is broad, and there are got over the Cross, and have healed
themselves in a false liberty, which stands in a seeming show of Godliness; and
in this state there is yet a travel in a strange Land, and something breaths
after i^ Native Country, where no Corruptible Mixture is; and with the Light
Man in this state is searched, and his deceitful heart discovered, out of which
proceeds both the Profaneness and Profession of Godliness; and with the Light
his heart opens, and he comes to see that his heart is not upright before the
Lord, neither is his heart the same with his Profession, but feigned humility
and hypocrisy lodges in it, and the Light smites him and corrects him, both
for his Profession and for his Profaneness; then Man comes to see himself
miserable, and to behold both his own Righteousness and filthiness, to rise out
of the Mixtures of the fallen properties, and sees himself in the weakness of
the Corruptible Being, and there he is sensible of the correcting hand of the
Lord, though he has denied much Profaneness, and be turned into a Profession of
Godliness, and Man comes to see that he is sucking a fruitless fountain, and a
dry breast, and so comes to mind the Light and wait in it, and it arises and
pulls down his strong Holds, and lays his fenced Cities waste, and brings
to naught the Glory of his fair shows, and stains the Pride of them; and he
comes to see that those things which he is observing without him cannot bring
contentment to him, but still the Light searches him, and pursues him, and
lays many sore and heavy stripes upon him, and also sets his sins in order
before him, and lets him see what a great body they are gendered in, which
makes him cry in his misery, Who shall deliver me? and he comes to be sensible
of his own Insufficiency, and to know that without Christ he is miserable for
ever, and that without Christ he can do nothing; and so sees that all without
him are miserable Comforters, and that there is no help to be found in them
when there is need; and then he something more enclines to the Light within
him, and is diligent unto it, and begins to hearken and obey, and to turn to it
and mind it, and to wait to feel its motion; and as it does convince him of
Evil, he has regard unto it, and yields himself to obey, and to deny that
which it does convince him of, and then comes to feel that it leads him out of
it, and also destroys it, and takes it away; and hereby Man comes to be
satisfied that it is the Truth of God, and the way wherein he ought to walk,
and he waits to feel its drawing, and it turns his face toward it, and begets
a willingness to give up to follow it; and so Man is not now only convinced,
but also converted and turned, both from common Profaneness, and also from his
seeming show of Godliness; and he becomes a follower of the Light, and to deny
himself in many things that the Light makes manifest to be Evil; and in the
Leadings of the Light he is kept in the Cross to his Corruptible will, and
walks in the strait gate and narrow way, and feels something of the Power to
crucify and remove many fleshly Lusts, that have made War against his Soul,
whereby he comes to feel that he is somewhat eased, and much weight taken off
and removed, which had been upon him, and a sore burden unto him; and something
begins to spring in the Deliverance that cried for it; and when the Light has
thus found Man, and Man is turned unto it, and that he cannot abide any longer,
either in Profaneness, or seeming show of Godliness; but presses in the Light
to come wholly out of the Mixtures of the fallen properties, to come into the
holy Order of the pure Creation; then does the Serpent strive in his Subtilty
to hold Man in some part of the Mixture, that so he may in something yet keep
dominion over him, and that he may not be set wholly free, but may serve him
still in something, though he have truly denied many things: And hence it is
that many stick in the Birth, who are convinced what is Truth, and also in many
things converted, and yet feel not true Freedom wrought, but are sensible of a
Travel that cries after a day of Deliverance; and here has the Serpent
deceived many, who have been convinced, and have had true openings and clear
discoveries in the manifestation of the Light, and not being watchful, the
Serpent has stepped in, and with his deceitful working he has beguiled Man,
as he beguiled Eve, and with the same fruit has tempted, and over many has
prevailed, and has drawn many minds in the openings to reach forth in the
eagerness to satisfy his lustful desire in the knowledge of Gods Truth; and
this has shut the Womb upon the Babe that tryes for deliverance, and so the
Judgment has been fled, and the Cross has been denied, and a false liberty
out of the fear has got up, and it has gendered unto sore bondage; and though
the Truth be confessed unto, and professed in practice, yet does the Seed lie
in bondage under the puffedup mind, that the Serpent has filled with
knowledge, in which he has generated a Body, and brought forth a false Birth,
whose neck is stiff, and the heart hard, and will not bow unto the Lord, nor be
subject to his Power, but in knowledge stands exalted, under which the true
Birth is oppressed, and the beauty of it marred by the false Generation of the
Serpents begetting, which rises out of the Mixture and receives its body from
the Earthly part of the fallen properties; and Man having seen the Truth in the
Openings, and the vain mind being filled with the knowledge of it, he takes
root in the Earthly, and in the Earthly he begins to grow and spread forth his
branches with a fair and flourishing show; and this Earthly body that is thus
conceived and generated, and likewise nourished in the Mixture of the fallen
properties, gets a tincture of Truth upon it in the Openings, as Lead may be
covered or tinned with pure Gold; and this Body bears a fair show, and
appears exceeding glorious, but is not the Glory of the only Begotten; and when
this is brought forth through the deceitful working of the old Serpent, then he
labors to nourish it that it may grow in strength, and be a tall man, and a
strong man, and be renownable; and this being desirable, it has been eagerly
pursued, and knowledge has increased, and a great growth there has been in
it; and Man has waxed into a high stature of it, and has sprung up in height
like a Cedar in Labanan, and has grown in the body of knowledge like an Oak in
Bashan; and under this high and mighty growth of knowledge, has the little
breathing Innocence been strangled, and sore burdened and oppressed, and has
still been striving underneath in the meckness and humbleness, and has often
reached the tall Cedar to bring it down, and to the strong Oak, to make it
bend; but the Cedar would not lose its glory, nor the Oak part with its
strength, but stoutly have stood, yea, and stubbornly resisted the tender
Innocence, and have cast off the Word of its Reproof; and the tall Cedar has
been lifted up, and has said, who shall rule over me? and the Oak it has been
stubborn, and has said, Who shall cause me to bow? And so they have trampled
over Innocence, as a thing of no esteem; and the Gold has been kept in the
Mixture, and the clean Separation has not been made, but the Subtilty has
wrought over it, and has kept the Dross and Tinn above it, and Man has not
liked the Furnace, neither has been willing to abide the Day of his Coming in
that Manifestation, but has saved his Life in the Mixture, in which the
Serpents Dominion stands, who in his Subtility has ever wrought secretly
against the Seed of Life, which is made manifest to bruise his head, and
destroy his work; and though Man may be convinced, and in many things
converted, and may have followed the Light in the Self-denial and daily cross,
to many of the Worlds Fashions, Customs, and Traditions, yet may the Seed be
still closed in the Womb of the Earthly Mixtures, and travel in sore pain for
want of deliverance; and as the Power has risen in Man, and has begun to work
in the Furnace, and to divide and separate betwixt the Precious and the Vile,
and the Furnace has been truly set to have refined, and the Fire has begun to
take hold to have consumed, that the Seed out of the Mixture might have been
redeemed, and an Holy Birth regenerated; then has the Serpent violently
stirred, seeing his Kingdom so near to be destroyed, and he in great danger to
be cast out and dis-possessed; and he has suddenly drawn Man from the Power,
and out of the Furnace that should have refined and brought forth the Gold
without Mixture, and he instantly has begotten Man into a false liberty, and
has exalted him over the Cross and Judgment, that the Life in the Earthly
could not abide, and there has the Enemy wrought in his Subtilty, and has
drawn Man's mind into a fleshly liberty, so as Man unto the World returns again,
and unto the Worlds Fashions and Customs is a Man conformable, and then dare
say in the stoutness of his heart, that he lives with God in the Inner man;
and having seen much, and also tasted something of the Word and Power, but not
in the Furnace abiding, to know a clean Separation made, and a perfect
Regeneration wrought, he becomes a very subtle worker, and a great Enemy to the
pure Innocence, being fled into the fallen properties to save his Life; and
from this ground a monstrous Birth is generated, and by the strength of the
Subtilty brought forth, and it is not in any ways like the true Birth, born in
the Regeneration, which from the holy Womb proceeds, and in the Furnace is
brought forth, without any Mixture of the Earthly part; and where it is truly
born, it changes the whole Man throughout, and perfectly redeems him out of
the World, with the Pashions, Customs and Traditions, and it has its
nourishment from the Breast of the holy Life, and grows in the pure holy nature
of it, and is strong in its Power, in which it makes war and overcomes the
Serpent and his Power: Let the tall Cedars and strong Oaks consider, and stoop
and bow, for they must fall and be broken, and the Innocence must reign because
it is pure, and there is no mixture in it; and also let such consider, who have
had a taste of the true Power, and have known something of its Work, and are
again returned unto Folly, and are flown up into the Air, and plead their
fleshly liberty as a thing that is natural to the visible Creation, and dare
say, that though such things appear, they do not desile the Inner man, neither
do they see! any reproof for their fleshly and carnal doings, but stand
justified before the Lord in their Inner man; let such know as from the Lord,
that they are Birds of the Air, and took their flight in Winter, and the Hand
of the Lord will bring them down; and let the Proud and Arrogant consider, who
dare to say that all their works, whether they be good or evil, are wrought in
God, and what they do, it is his doings, though it be Drunkenness, or any other
Evil, and so are in the devilish spirit, ranting and making merry over the Pure
Innocent Life; let such sink down, and hereby know, yea, as from the Lord, that
their Life is for Death, and their Works for Judgment; for the holy Seed is
risen that bruiseth the Serpents head, and he cannot save it with all his
twisting, nor keep his deceitful works from Judgment; but all his building
must be defaced, and all his works destroyed.

CHAP. VIII. The New Birth in the Regeneration, and also the Serpents Working.
MAn being degenerated from the holy Order of the Pure Creation, and being
fallen under the Serpents power, who is a subtle and deceitful Worker, all the
faculties and properties of Man are in disorder, and are become a Chaos of
Confusion, and without being regenerated and born again he cannot come into his
place in which he stood in the Pure Creation, and enjoyed the Presence of the
Pure God; neither an he come to the Tree of Life, but is shut out and fenced
with the flaming Sword; for the Unclean cannot enter into the Pure, neither can
come to feed upon the holy Life, but must with the Sword be cut down, and with
the Flame be consumed; and Man through the fiery Furnace must pass before he
can inherit the Kingdom, or possess Eternal Life, which in the Pure Creation
was its Rest and Portion; and with this Pure Light is Man in all his ways
found out, that he might return and come again to inherit and possess the life
from which he is degenerated and fallen; and with the Light he is in his own
Conscience convinced of the things that are evil, that he might not abide in
them, but that he might forsake them, and deny them, and follow the light out
of them; and as Man comes into the Obedience, be comes to know that the Light
of Christ in his Conscience, which does show him Sin, and convinces him of Sin,
that it is sufficient to save him from Sin, and redeem him out of Sin, and
destroy the body of Sin, and thereby restore him again into the holy Order of
the Pure Creation, where he enjoyed the Presence of God, and was good in the
sight of God; and this is that which seeks lost Man, and is made manifest to
save and redeem him out of his lost estate; and all that have believed in it
through Ages and Generations, have known the effectual working of its Power, by
which they have been redeemed out of the Earth, and from the vain Conversation
of the World, and walked as Pilgrims and Strangers in the World; And this Pure
Light was with Abel, and in it he sacrificed, and his Sacrifice was accepted;
it was with Seth, and in it he called upon the Name of the Lord; it was with
Noah, and in it he was preserved, when the Flood came upon the world of the
Ungodly; it was with Abraham, and in it he believed, and it was counted unto
him for Righteousness; it was with Isaac, and in it he was the Heir of Promise;
it was with Jacob, and in it he went over Esau's Mount, and out of his loins
came the twelve Tribes, whom God chose for his own Inheritance: it was with
Moses, and in it he led forth the Inheritance of God out of Egypt: it was with
David, and in it his Horn was exalted: it was with Job, and in it he was
redeemed, and knew his Redeemer lived: it was with Isaiah, and in it he saw a
Child born, and a Son given: it was with Malachy, and in it he saw the
Separation, and the Fuel out of the Mixture: it was with John, and in it he
saw the Lamb of God, and did behold the Glory of the only Begotten of the
Father. And this pure Light of the holy Seed of Life, has had its course
through all Generations, and has been made manifest through the several
Dispensations and Administrations, as it has pleased the Father of Spirits,
and they that did believe in it, did not abide in darkness, nor did not
continue satisfying the lustful desire of the fleshly part, but were
Regenerated through the effectual working of the power whereby they became dead
to Sin, and alive to God, and were born of the holy Seed, which made them holy
Men, and with it they were filled and divinely inspired, and then they
testified of its Power, and it was the same thing unto them all, and neither
changed its quality nor property, though diversely it manifested it self; and
all the holy Men of God, that gave forth the Scriptures, they had the Name in
the Nature of the holy Seed, and were born of it through the Regeneration; and
this was a work that was wrought before Scriptures were written, and was the
same work in them that writ the Scriptures, and it has been the same in
Generations since the Scriptures were written; and it is the work of Christ,
the holy Seed, and it is proper unto him alone, to regenerate and make a New
Man; and no man can add to the work of Regeneration, for it is an Inward work,
wrought by an Invisible Power, that no mortal Eye can behold: And this work at
this day is witnessed amongst a Remnant, whom he has chosen to be his own
Peculiar People; and as Man turns to the Light of Christ in his own Conscience,
it will open his own Condition to him, and make manifest every secret thing,
that the Serpent has begotten and drawn his Life into; and it will clearly
discover unto a Man's understanding that they are evil and sinful: and as he
minds the Light, and obeys it, it will lead him out of the Evil that it
makes manifest unto him; and thus far Man is convinced, and also converted:
Then the Serpent begins to make war, and lahours to hold Man in those things
which he has begotten in him; but as Man joins to the Light he will receive
strength to stand against him, and also to overcome him; for after a Man is
convinced, and also converted and turned to the Light, then he enters into a
great fight of Afflictions, and has a sore Conflict to pass through, as he
abides faithful, before he get the Serpent under his feet; and after Conversion
the Serpent besets Man sore, and labors with all his might to stop him in
his travel, so that Man is sometimes kept by the subtle working of the Serpent,
and cannot readily get on, nor clearly cast off those things which be is
turning from, in obedience to the Light, but is still ^ept by the Serpent, who
labors to save his head from bru^ing; and the way that he has to do it, is to
draw Man into the Reasoning, and there to consult how it will be with him, if
he wholly give up and deny those things that he is convinced of, and also
turning from, and what will be the end if he part with them; And here have many
felt the Dragons war against the Innocent Lamb, that has been traveling for
Freedom from under the Corruptible things, which have oppressed his Innocent
Life; and Man harkening to the Serpent, and entering into Reasoning and
Consulting, the Serpeut keeps the Vail over him, and then shows what great
loss it will be unto him if he go on to deny all those things, that he is
convinced of to be evil, and is turning from; and also persuades him, that if
he should follow the Light unto the end, and part with all for it, yet it is
not sufficient to save him: and under this Vail many stumble at the Light, and
draw back and follow no further, though for a time they have in some things
been obedient; and this is the Man that loves something more than Christ, and
cannot part with his own Life, for the gain of Life Eternal: And thus does the
old Serpent work for the safety of his Kingdom; but through his strong holds
have many broken, and from his bonds they are loosed in the power of the Light,
which being minded and obeyed, it does convert Man's mind from the thing that is
Evil, and arises in its power to judge it and condemn it, and upon the Cross
to crucisie it; so that Man dies unto it, and it dies in Man; and as a
Drunkard minds the Light, and obeys the Light, when it does convince him
that Drunkenness is Sin, it will lead him out of Drunkenness, and destroy that
work of darkness, and take away Man's Life in it; And this is the Work of
Christ, who is made manifest to destroy the work of the Devil, and to burn it
up with unquenchable fire, that he thereby may set Man free from under the
burden of all Corruptible things; and whatever it is that the Serpent has
generated in Man since the beginning, and drawn Man's heart to lust after, the
Light which was in the beginning, in which is no sin, but pure and undefiled,
it does appear against it, and also every lustful desire that has its
rejoicing in it, and it brings it down with a stroke of severe Judgment; and as
Man in the Light believes, even so does it work, and appear in its power, to
destroy every Lust in which the Serpent has dominion over Man, and in which he
makes war against the Soul; and as Man denies himself, and takes up the Cross,
and follows the Light faithfully, he becomes a dying man, and the Power
separateth between the Precious and the Vile; and then He will be felt, whose
Fan is in his hand, and the Fire will be known which burns up the Chaff; and as
Man abides this Day, and keeps in the Righteous Judgment, the Old Man will be
crucisied, and all his Deeds consumed, and neither Profaneness, nor seeming show
of Godliness, shall stand in the Judgment, but the Tallest must come down, and
the Strongest must bow; for the Fire will not spare, but through the Earth will
pass; and that which is of the Earth must burn, and none can quench; and Man
abiding this Day, and keeping in the Patience, Judgment will be brought forth
unto Victory, and Man will come forth dead to himself, and alive in Christ, and
so will come to know that Christ works that Work which no other can do, and
that the Light does not only show him his Sin, and convince him of it, but if
he turn, obey, and believe in it, so it will take the Sin away, and purge his
Conscience from the dead works, and redeem him out of all the Lusts which the
Serpent has generated in him, and has begotten his Life into; and he will
know his Redeemer lives, and Salvation he will feel in the Light, which does
condemn his sin in the flesh: and here Drunkard is redeemed out of Drunkenness,
a Swearer from Swearing, a Liar from Lying, a Covetous Man from Covetousness,
an Angry man from Anger; and so out of all Vain Pleasures, Sports, Jesting,
Headiness, Wildness, Customs, Fashions and Traditions that are in the World
through Lust; With the Light Man is redeemed through its Righteous Judgment,
for with its pure searching quality it finds out every secret thing of the old
lustful nature, and proceeds against it in Judgment; so that the Serpent cannot
escape the Light, but with all his Subtilty he is found out; and as Man
believes in the Light, so does the Judgment fall upon the Serpents head; and
though it be long before Man can give up himself truly, to deny all things that
he is convinced of to be evil, or before he can get clearly through, or to the
end of much that he is turning from; or before he can witness a perfect
Regeneration through the fire of cleansing; yet, as Man in the Light believes
and follows it, the Work is going on and prospering, and the Lusts and evil
deeds are dying, and the Serpent he is weakening, and does not come upon Man so
furiously and forcibly as formerly, but his Temptations are weaker, and Man in
the Light he is stronger, and stands with courage to resist him; and as Man
feels at any time dominion over the Serpent, and that he is able, as he abides
in the Light, to resist him; so does his strength and courage increase, and he
stands boldly in the battle, and yields not when temptations come, but brings
them under, and treads them down; and as the Serpent comes upon Man, and
appears to tempt him into that Lust which Man is making war against; Man stands
prepared unto battle, and is strong and of a good courage, and goes forth
against him in his first appearance, and in the power of the Light places true
Judgment upon his head, and bruiseth him, and so Man is preserved from him, and
abstains from Evil in the appearance of it; and this is the Serpents great
design to keep Man alive to himself, and to delight in his hearts lusts,
whereby he rules over him, and takes him captive at his will, and he is not
willing to let him go if all his subtilty can hold him; therefore many
Temptations come upon Man after he is convinced and comes to own the Truth of
God; and as he converts and turns unto the Lord, he is many times sorely beset
in his way, and often ready to be driven quite back again: and hence it is that
Man finds such a strong Warfare in his Spiritual Travel, and finds it such a
hard work to come into the Regenerated State, because there he must deny
himself, and forsake all his hearts Lusts, and lay down his Life in the
Judgment, and abide the Fire of Refinement; and as Man in the Light begins to
approach near unto this great Work, then the Serpent strives in his subtilty to
withhold him and keep him back, and so the two in their contrary natures are
felt in the strife; and this Gate is strait, and few there be that find it; And
as Man stands faithful and abides in the Light, he will feel strength to
support him when the Enemy thus violently pursues him, and he will stand a
Conqueror over those Lusts that have had dominion over him; and when the
Serpent finds that he cannor keep Man in the Inordinate Affection, and lead him
forth to satisfy his Lust to the full, as he had wont to do; then in his
subtilty he abates his Temptation, and persuades Man that he may use things
moderately, and keep out of Excess, for it is the Excess that makes it to
become Evil, and so to be condemned; but if he cease from Excess, the moderate
use will not bring Condemnation: so he tells the Drunkard, if he keep himself
from being drunk, he may moderately keep his Friend company, and he may be
merry with him: and he tells the Proud in heart, if they use not Excess in
their Apparel, they may go decently according to their quality; and the like
Temptations for other Lusts he has; and he tells Man, the moderate use of them
will not bring Condemnation: but here some have found him a Liar, as he is, who
came to abstain and restrain from the Excess of many things, which once they
were serving their Lusts in, and caine down to that which the Devil called
Moderation, but found it was in the hearts lusts still, and with the Light was
still condemned and judged, and no rest nor peace could be found, until the
Devil was wholly denied, and the hearts Lusts given up to the Cross, and there
crucified, and thereby Redemption perfectly wrought in the Power of Christ, and
then comes the right use to be made of ill things in their place with true
moderation; and in the use of them in the Redeemed state there is no
Condemnation, for they are received and used in the fear of the Lord, and what
is useful and no more; and there is no Lust abiding that reaches forth beyond
the present need, and there is the Blessing felt; but Man that hearkens to the
Serpent, and takes that for Moderation that he calls so, he is deceived; and
though he lessen the use of that which the Light reproves him for in the
Inordinate Affection, yet will the Light still condemn him, and judge him in
his own Conscience, until he come to the Power, and there have his Lust truly
Crucified: So the Serpent tells the Drunkard, he may drink moderately, and be
merry with his Friend: he tells the Proud, he may put on such Garments as are
suitable to his quality amongst men, so that he keep within the bounds of
Moderation: And many have here denied common Drunkenness, and yet satisfying
the old lust in the Excess: And many that cannot wear so many Ribbands, nor
great Cuffs, as sometimes they could, yet they must have some bunches of
Ribbands, and little Cuffs; Then says the Devil, thou art now in the
Moderation, and do no more, or hardly so much as becomes thy quality. And now
to give one true and faithful Experience, though many in these things might be
truly demonstrated: I know a Man who once was alive to himself, and served his
Lusts, and loved Pleasures more than God, and in one thing the Serpent had
sealed his life more than in many others, and his delight was chiefly in it;
and after he came to obey the Light of Christ in his Conscience, it was clearly
discovered unto him to be exceeding Evil; and though he minded the Light, and
stood in the Cross to his lustful desire, yet the Devil did not cease to
provoke eagerly, still to satisfy the Lust, though he could not do the thing
as he had done in the use of it, the Terror of the Lord was upon him, and his
Righteous Judgment reached unto him, and many sore stripes he bore: then says
the Serpent, Lessen thy Inordinate Affection, and it will not be so with thee:
then he came from the use of much, to the use of less; but the Judgment still
pursued him, and the Terror increased upon him, and though the use of it was in
the end so much lessened, as it was hardly used at all; yet when it was used,
the Judgment ceased not, but Plagues were forthwith poured, and it was just
with the Holy God so to do, and he could find no Peace, until he gave up his
Life in the Lust, and stood upon his Watch, and whenever the Serpent approached
with that Temptation, he placed Judgment upon his head, and so walked in the
daily Cross, until he was Crucified unto the Lust, and the Lust Crucified unto
him, which now is as dead as if it had never been. Unto Him be Glory for
evermore; who undertook the Cause, and perfected his own Work. Now Man that
comes not to know the Lust crucified in the ground, he is betrayed into a false
Moderation, and as he there stands, he looks at himself to be above many
others, who yet abide in the Inordinate Affection; and so the Serpent works
deceivably, to keep Man out of the Furnace, and to lead him afar off from
Judgment; and though the Inordinate Affection may be abated, yet the Lust is
not crucified, but the life in it is saved, and Man here flies for his life,
that when he should deny himself and take up the Cross, he denies the Cross
and saves himself, and slies the Judgment, and cannot abide that day; but as
Man keeps to the Light, this way will be made easy, and he will be able to
tread through it, and come to the end of it, and conquer the Serpent who works
against him; and as Man follows the Light faithfully, it brings him to the
Judgment and keeps him in the Judgment, and there he waits and abides until
Judgment be brought forth unto Victory; and he, as a willing man, walks in the
daily Cross, and cheerfully gives up all his hearts Lusts to be crucified, and
then he feels the Enmity slain, that has begotten and nourished the Lust; and
so Man comes truly through the Furnace, and abides the Fire of Refinement, in
which the Separation is made, and the Corruptible is burned and destroyed; then
the Holy Seed of Life appears without any Mixture, and the Creation is
delivered out of travel and pain, and in this Fiery Furnace is Man regenerated,
where the Old man is destroyed, his hearts Lusts crucified, the body of Sin
consumed, the Dross and Tin purged, the Gold clearly separated, and brought
forth in its own pure property and quality; and through this living eternal
operation is Man recovered out of the Fall, and the Pure Creation is again
restored into its holy Order, in which it was very good, and Man is then
redeemed out of the fallen properties, where he has been lusting after evil,
and comes again into the Paradise of Pleasure, and has his course unto the
Tree of Life, and the flaming Sword does not now fence it from him; and this is
the Regeneration which Man must come to know in the Fire of Refinement, where
he must part with all that is his own, whether Filthiness or Right cousness,
and come through without any unclean thing; or he cannot enter into the Kingdom
of God; and Man must put off the Corruptible part of the Earthly, where he is
in the Degeneration, before he can be brought into the Holy Order of the Pure
Creation; and as the Old he puts off in the Fire of Refinement, and abides in
the Work of Regeneration, he comes to the New, and receives the New, and it is
born in him, and thereby his, Change is wrought, and he is redeemed out of the
fallen Properties into the Holy Order of Life, and he is now no more his own,
neither can he satisfy Lust any longer, but is truly dead unto it, and his
Life is renewed in the Birth of the holy Seed, of which he is born, and in
which he is a New man, and so puts off Drunkenness, and dies to that Lust, and
puts on Sobriety, and lives in that Virtue; he puts off Anger, and dies to that
Lust, he puts on ^eekness, and lives in that Virtue; he puts off Envy, and
dies to that Lust, he puts on Love, and lives in that Virtue: and so in all
things that the Serpent has begotten through his deceitful working, that
stands in the Old lustful Nature, the Light judges it, the Power crucisieth
it, the Fire burns and consumes it, and so cleanses Man from his
Defilements, and clears the way for the Holy Birth to spring, and for the
^^mb that from the foundation of the world has been slain, to come into
Dignity and Dominion to Reign: so to die is gain; And blessed is the Man that
dies in the Lord, he comes to inherit Life and Immortallity, and to possess
durable Riches, and a Life without end; and is an Heir of God, and a Joynt-heir
with Christ, in whom he is made a New Man, and boars a Heavenly Image, in which
the Father is glorified, who is over all, blessed for ever.

CHAP. IX. The New Creation in the holy Order.
THE Lord God of Eternal Glory, searches after Man in his fallen and
degenerated state, and with his pure Light he finds him afar of, with his feet
walking in dark paths, and his way in the Land of Desolation, and there does he
visit him in his poor and low degree; for Man is fallen from God, and departed
from his Maker, the Serpent has deceived him, and with his subtilty has drawn
him out of the holy Order, and has enticed his mind into the fallen Properties
of the visible part of the Earthly, where he is a servant to the subtle Worker,
and satisfies his own hearts lusts that is fleshly, and is a sinner against the
holy God, and in the disorder of the unruly affections, where the pure Creation
is in Bondage, and travelleth in sore pain, and the old Heavens, and the old
Earth moves over it, and heavily oppresses it; and man in the fallen Estate is
never at Rest, nor his heart satisfied with lusting; and in this Separation
from the God of Mercy, is Man plunging in the depth of Misery; a sinner he is,
and Death reigns over him, and wrath is upon him, and in the disorder of the
unruly affections, his life is driven about and tossed, and there is no
stedfastness in him; and in this troubled state, there is a cry unto the Lord,
and a breathing goes forth that would be in rest, and the Lord has respect,
and hears, and in bowels of pity he arises to help, he stretches forth his
Arm, and brings the Mountains down; he comes forth in power and makes the Hills
to melt; he utters his voice, and the Earth trembles, he kindles a fire and
consumes it into Ashes; he brings Man into the Nothingness, and dissolves the
old Birth into its dust; he causes the old Heavens to pass away with a noise,
and he melts the Elements with fervent heat; and Man no longer lives therein,
but his life is taken away, and he lies slain and dead, and there is no motion
in him, until the Spirit of Life from God come into him, and create him new
into the holy Order of Life, and so gives him breath and being as in the
beginning; and he is made and fashioned with the hand of God, and is the
Workmanship of God, in whom he now receives his life, and out of whose bowels
he draws his breath, whereby he is perfectly renewed in the spirit of his nind,
and has no old thing upon him, nor Earthly part abiding in him; but through
the fire of Refinement he is made dean, and out of the Virgins Womb he springs,
and sucks the beast which gives Life, whereby he grows in strength, and in
wisdom increases, and comes into the stature of the fullness of Christ, and
partakes of his divine nature; all old things being put off, and all done away
in the fire of Refinement, he comes forth of the Furnace a naked Child, and a
new Creation springs, and a new Creature Man is made, and rises with the lamb
in his nature, and the Pearl's glory he is clothed withal, and into the holy
order of Life he is restored, and has his way in the pleasant Paradise, and
his food from the Tree of life, and his motion stands in the Power and Wisdom
of the Seed, which is come into dominion, and reigns in its pure quality and
property, without any mixture, and there is no Corruptible thing abides upon
it, but in the Refining Fire is purged and consumed; and as Man abides the
Fire, and waits (...) the Judgment, he puts off the Old in which he has lived,
and he puts on the New and is translated; and here man truly ^kes to himself,
and receives Christ the Seed of Life, and puts him on, whereby he feels
Christ made unto him Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption; and
in his Power and Wisdom, he brings forth a New Creation in the holy Order of
his pure Life, in which the six days works are passed through, and the
Separation and Consumption is wrought in the Furnace, where the Fire cleanses,
and the seventh ^y is come unto, which is holy unto the Lord, in which Man
^osts from all his own works, as God did from his, and sits down in the power
and wisdom of the holy Seed, and rests in the stilness of its divine Nature, of
which he truly is made a partaker; and in it he is transformed, and stands in
the holy Order of the New Creation, in which he is perfectly made a new
Creature, and has his motion in the new Heavens, and new Forth, wherein dwells
Righteousness; and with Righteousness he is covered as with a Robe, and
Holiness is become his Vesture; and he bears the Heavenly Image in the Life,
and is lovely and amiable to behold, and is in the sight of the holy God, very
good. Thus is the New Creation finished with all the host of it, and is brought
forth in the holy Order, through the effectual working of the holy Power; and
Man is changed and renewed in the holy Birth of the Immortal Seed, and again is
placed in the Paradise of pleasure, and is not senced from the Tree of Life,
but has access unto it, and it is his daily food, and he lives by it, and
rests in the comfort and consolation of it, which is Life without end.

CHAP. X. The Way and Works of Man in the New Creation.
AS Man believes in the Light, which from the Life shines forth, and in his own
Conscience is made manifest, he comes to the Righteous Judgment of God, who
passes Sentence against him, and condemns him to death, where upon the Cross
he is Crucified, and there he dies unto himself, with all his hearts lust, both
in thought, word, and deed; then does the Fire take hold, and burns and
consumes, and through its operation wholly dissolves the old Man, and destroys
all his deeds; and through destruction unto the Corruption, there springs a
holy pure Generation, which has its Conception in the Matrix of Eternity, and
is brought forth in the holy Order of Life, and in this holy Generation is Man
restored into his first Order, and is truly the Offspring of God, and has his
motion in the Power and Wisdom of God; and in this Restoration Man is changed,
and becomes a new Man in Christ, and his way and all his works are new, and he
becomes a Well-doer, and is accepted of God in Christ the Beloved; and here Man
finds the new and living Way, which makes him a new and living Man, and leads
him unto the living God; and this is the Way of Holiness in which the clean
feet walk, and Man that is in it ordered, he is in the way of Peace, and is led
into the green Pastures of Everlasting Refreshings, and he walks continually
by the pleasant Streams, and has his Course by the River that makes glad the
whole City; and in the holy Life of the Immortal Seed is his Life bound up, and
he is ordered in the motion of it, and he does not stir but in the holy order
of it, and it is the strength of his Reins, and the girdle of his Loins, and
keeps Man in close Communion with it, whereby he is strengthened to run the way
of every Command, and there is no feebleness upon his loins, but perfect
strength in the motion of the holy Seed, which carries him as upon Eagles
wings; and he runs and is not weary, he walks and is not faint, and his way is
holy, and his works holy unto the Lord, and he is Created in Christ Jesus that
he should walk in them, and is no more his own, but in the Lords disposing, and
truly serves the Lord in Righteousness and true Holiness; and he no more thinks
his own thoughts, nor speaks his own words, nor works his own works, but is
moved and acted in the Power and Wisdom of the holy Seed, of which he is born
and made a new Creature; and his works are works of Holiness, proceeding from
the Life of Christ, and man is holy as he is holy; for unto good works he is
Craated in Christ, and his delight in the new Creation is in the thing that is
good, and in a new and living Way he walks, and brings forth new and living
Works, in the living Power and Wisdom of the holy Seed; and thus Man is
changed, and is made a Holy Man, a Righteous Man, a Godly Man, Sober, Chaste,
Gentle, Meek, Patient, Loving, Kind, Good, Lowly, Tenderhearted, Forbearing,
and Long-suffering, and in all things he walks as becomes the order of the holy
Life, into which he is born, and in which he lives and moves, and he becomes a
Lamb in the Lambs nature, and beautiful in the brightness and holiness of the
Pearl's Glory; And thus i^ Man translated and changed, through the effectual
Working of Gods mighty Power; and with a new heart he glorifies his Maker, and
is sincere and upright in his heart before God, and the Lord. God takes
pleasure in him, and approves his Way and his Work, and justifies him therein,
and there is no Condemnation upon him, nor any Wrath or Curse goes forth
against him, or falls upon him, but in the Eternal Love he dwells, and the Love
dwells in him, and the Image of it he bears, and it is clear from defilement,
spot, or blemish; then does the Glory shine in the Precious Pearl, and the
Scepter of the Lamb does bear its sway, and upon his Throne he is exalted, and
with pure Righteousness he clothes his Saints, and Crowns of pure Gold upon
their heads he sets, and in the Holy Land with him they rest, and in the Holy
Order of his Life they move, and they learn the Songs of Holiness, and sing his
Praise within the Gates; for he fills them with Joy and Gladness, and with a
New Heart and a New Spirit they sound his Name, and cease not to give Glory,
and Honor, and Thanksgiving, and Praise, and Dominion, and Hallilujahs unto
him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for evermore.

1.
OH! Mortal Man, thy Way and Works consider;
Sleep not in Death, lest thou there die for ever.
Awake, and stand upright, that thou restored may be
Both from thy Sins and Evils great, with all Iniquity.
2.
Thou wast created Good, and stoodst in great Renown,
A Noble Plant thou wast, but soon thou were cast down:
The Serpent thee deceived, and drew thee into evil,
And thou by him art led astray, according to his will.
3.
From God thou art driven out, and from his dwelling place,
The Earth thy habitation is, and there thou run'st thy race.
Thou neither stay'st nor stop'st, but run'st and hastens on,
Until thou fall'st into the Pit, where bonds of Death are strong.
4.
Oh! hearken, and be still, the Lord is seeking thee,
And with his Light of Life, he cries, Return to me.
This in thy Conscience he has placed, thy Evil deeds to show,
That thou may to Repentance come, and know the thing that is true
5.
The Light of Christ is true, and shines forth in all men:
And every Evil deed it brings up to be seen.
And thou in it may know thy Thoughts and Works each one;
And in thy self thou may behold, whatever thou have done.
6.
If thou unto the Light do turn, and in it do believe,
It will not leave thee in thy Sins, but certainly relieve:
And unto thee it strength will be, against thy deadly Foes,
And from thy sins will set thee free, in which thou daily grows.
7.
Oh! turn to it with speed, thy danger's very great;
Thou art in the broad way, and not in the strait gate:
(...) liv'st in Flesh, and serv'st thy Lust, which causes wrath to fall,
That unto thee, in fury, does come like to bitter Gall.
8.
Thou have no pleasure in its taste, because it does torment;
Why then do thou abide in Sin, and do not soon repent?
The Light does show, and also call, and makes known unto thee
Thy Sins and thy Transgressions great, with all Iniquity.
9.
And as the Light thou mind'st, and yeeld'st for to obey,
It will not only show thee Sin, but take it quite away.
(...) that end it is manifest, the Serpent's head to bruise,
And all his works for to destroy, if thou do not refuse.
10.
Its quality is pure, and searches through thy heart;
It will convince thee in thy self, and tell thee what thou art.
(...) will not thee deceive, but will deal plain with thee;
And if thou do in it believe, a Convert thou will be.
11.
And when thou art converted, keep watchful to the Light;
For then the Enemy will stir, and thou will find a fight.
(...) Life will be required, and thou must lay it down,
And from the Cross do not thou fly, until the Work be done.
12.
So in the Furnace thou will know, a New Birth brought to light,
As in the Judgment thou abid'st, and stand'st by Faith to fight.
The Serpent thou will overcome, and all his deeds destroy,
Which have deprived thee of thy Peace, and of thy Rest and Joy.
13.
Now hear, all ye Professors, with all that be Profane;
You Cedars tall, and Oaks so strong, who have a glorious fame.
^u flying Birds, and Ranting Strains, who are soared up on high,
The Fire is kindled at your Root; come down before you dye.
14.
Lie low, and be you still, the Judgment you must pass,
The true Birth is in Bondage sore; your Life above it is:
Which from you must be taken, before the Life you know,
That from on high, is come to try, in what you stand and grow.
15.
Your Births are all defiled, corrupted and unclean,
The Fire has not consumed, nor purged away your Tin.
You yet lie in the Mixture, and are not separate,
That make the Seed to groan, under the Earthly part.
16.
Come forth all ye Unclean, whose Bed is so desil'd,
Come down unto the Pure, and know the Little Child,
Which in the Womb does travel, and would delivered be,
That you may be regenerate, and from all Burdens free.
The Heavenly Harmony in the Eternal Unity.
1.
THou Pure Simple Birth, of the Immortal Seed,
Thy Love is sweet and free, Thou giv'st to all that need:
You Are pleasant to the taste, Thy Pasture's fresh and green,
The Glory of Thy Countenance is now beheld and seen.
2.
Thou holy Lamb of Life, who come down from on high;
Thou art the Shepherd of thy Flock, thy Sword's upon thy Thigh;
Stretch forth thy Arm, and smite thy Foes, that would not have thee raig^
That Praise to Thee in Unity, may sound abroad thy fame.
3.
Thou precious beauteous Pearl, that is refined clear,
Thy Luster shines in Nature pure; no Mixture do thou bear:
Thy Countenance is full of Love, Thy Riches is the Treasure;
Thee to possess, is Life Endless: to whom be Praise for ever.
4.
The Birth, the Lamb, the Pearl are One,
the Only true begotton Son,
Who sits in Glory on his Throne;
to whom be Hallelujahs sung.
Even so, Amen, Even so, Amen:
Praises to Thee, Thou Holy One.
W. S.
THE END.
