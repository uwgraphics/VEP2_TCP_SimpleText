His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
I AM come to Give you Thanks for the Supplies, Provided for Carrying on the
War, in which We are Engaged, and at the same Time, to Conclude this Session,
which cannot be Continued longer without Manifest Prejudice to the Ends for
which those Supplies are Given. The Season of the Year making it so Necessary
for Me to be Abroad, that it were to be Wished Our Business at Home would have
Allowed Me to have been there sooner.

I will take Care to Place the Administration of Affairs, during My Absence, in
such Persons, on whose Care and Fidelity I can Entirely Depend; And I Doubt
not, My Lords and Gentlemen, but every one of you, in your several Stations,
will be Assisting to them: This is what I Require of you, and that you be more
than Ordinarily Vigilant in Preserving the Public Peace.

Then the Lord Keeper, by His Majesty's Command, said,
My Lords and Gentlemen,
IT is His Majesty's Royal Will and Pleasure, that this Parliament should be
Prorogued to Tuesday the Eighteenth day of June next; and this Parliament is
accordingly Prorogued to Tuesday the Eighteenth day of June next.

FINIS.
