Here endyth the Interpretaco^n of the names of goddis and goddesses as is
^ehercyd in this treatise following. /
Here begins this present treatise
When Phoebus in y^ crabbe had n^r his course ro^ne
And toward y^ lyo^ his journey take
To look on Pi^tagoras spear I had bego^ne
Sitting all solytary alone beside a lake
Musyng on a manner how y^ I might make
Reason and sensualyte in one to acorde
But I could not bring abowte y^ monacorde
For long e^ I might sleep me began oppress
So poderously I cowde make none ^^stacle
In mine heed was fall such an heaviness
I was feyne to draw to mine habytacle
To rowne with a pylow me semyd best tryacle
So laid I me down my diseese to releue
Anon came in Morpleus and took me by the sleue
And as I so lay half in a traunse
Twene slepynge and wakyng he bad me arise
For he said I must give attendaunce
To the great court of Mynos the Justice
Me naught auaylled again him to sylogyse
For it is often said by them y^ yet lives
He must needs goo y^ the devil dryues
When I saw no better but I must go
I said I was ready at his commandment
Wheder y^ he would me led to or fro
So up I arose and forth with him went
Till he had me brought to the parlyament
Where Pluto sat and kept his astate
And with him Mynos the Judge dysperate
But as we thyderward went by the way
I him besought his name me to tell
Morpleus he said y^ me call may
A sir said I then where do ye dwell
In heaven or in earth or else in hell
Nay he said mine abydyng most comynly
Is in a little corner called Fantasy
And as soon as he these words had said
Cerberus the porter of hell with his cheyne
Brought thither Colus in ragg^ evil arayd
Again whom Neptunus and Dyana did co^pleyne
Saying thus o Mynos thou Judge souereyne
Give thy cruel Judgment a^e^st this traitor so
y^ we may have cause to preyse thy lord Pluto
Then was there made a proclamaco^n
In Plutoes name co^ma^nded stylence
Upon the pain of streyte corre^^o^n
y^ Dyana and Neptunus might have audyence
To declare there greyf of the great offense
To them do by Colus whereon they co^pleyned
And to begin Dyana was constreyned
Which thus began as ye shall here
Saying in this wise. o thou lord Pluto
with thy Judge Mynos syttyng with the in fere
Execute your fury upon Colus so
Acordyng to the offense y^ he to me has do
That I have no cause ferther to apele
Which if I do shall not be for your well
Remember first how I a goddess pure
Over all deserts forestes and chaces
Have take the gydyng and under my cure
This traitor Colus has many of my plac^
Distroyed with his blastes and daily me menac^
Where any wode is he shall make it plain
If he to his lyberte may resort again
The grettest trees that any man may find
In forest to shade the dear for there comfort
He bre^^ith them ason^ and re^teth them rote and r^de
Out of the earth this is his disport
So y^ the dear shall have no resort
Within short time to no manner shade
Where through the game is lykly to fade
Which to my name a reproach synguler
Should be for ever while the world last
And to all the goddys an high displeyser
To see the game so distroyed by his blast
Wherefore a remedy puruey in have
And let him be punysshyd after his offense
Consydre the crime. and give your sentence
And wha^ thus Dyana had made her co^pleynt
To Mynos y^ Judge in Plutoes presence
Came forth Neptunus with vysage pale and feynt
Desiring of favor to have audyence
Saying thus Pluto to thy magnyfycence
I shall reherce what this creature
Colus has done me out of mesure
Thou know well that I have the charge
Over all the sea. and thereof god I am
No ship may sail. ^eruell bote nor barge
Great karyke: nor hulke with any living man
But if he have my sau^conduyte than
Who me offendyth within my Iurisdicco^n
O with to submytte him to my correcco^n
But in as much as it is now so
That ye him here have as your prysonere
I shall you show my compleynt loo
Wherefore I pray you y^ ye woll it here
And let him not escape out of your daungere
Till he has made full sees and recompense
For hurt of my name through his great offense
First to begin* this Colus has often
Made me to return my course against nature
with his great blastis when he has be a lofte
And charged me to labor far out of mesure
y^ it was great merueylle how I might endure
The ^ome of my sweet woll it testifye
That on the sea banks lies beten full hye
Secondly where as my nature is
Both to ebb and flow and so my course to keep
Often of mine intent has he made me mys
Where as I should have fyllyd dyches deep
At a full water I might not thither crepe
Before my season came to return again
And then went I faster than I would certain
Thus has he me drive against mine intent
And contrary to my course natural
Where I should have be he made me be absent
To my great dishonor and in especyall
Oo thing he used that was worst of all
For where as I my ^aufgarde grauntyd
^y in that cost he comynly hauntyd
Of very pure malice and of sylfewyll
Them to distroye in dyspyte of me
To whom I promised both in good and ill
To be her protector in all aduersyte
That them should fall upon the sea
And even suddenly er they cowde beware
With a sodeyn piry he lappy^^ them in care
And full often sith with his boystous b^^^^
Er they myt beware he droof he^ on the sond^
And other while he brake top saylle and mast
Which caused the^ to peryssh er they cam^ to lo^d^
Then cursyd they y^ time y^ ever me fond
Thus among the people lost is my name
And so by his labor put I am to shame
Consider this matter and ponder my cause
Tender my compleynt as rygour requires
Show forth your sentence with a breyf ^ause
I may not long tarry the time fast expyreth
The offense is great wherefore it desires
The more grievous pay^ and hasty Judgment
For offense don wylfully will non a^ysement
And* when y^ god Pluto a while hy^ bethought
He ro^^^d with Mynos to know what was to do
Then he said openly look thou faylle naught
Thy sentence to ^eue without favor so
Like as thou have herd y^ causes me^yd y^ to
And so euynly dele twene these parties twey^
y^ none of them have cause on y^ other co^pley^
Then said Mynos full Indifferently
To Dyana and Neptunus. is there any more
That ye woll declare again him openly
Nay in deed they said we keep none in store
We have said enough to punysshe him fore
If ye in this matter be not parcyall
Remember your name was wont to be egall
Well then said Mynos now let us here
What this boystous Colus for himself can say
For here (prima facie) to us does apere
That he has offended no man can say nay
Wherefore thou Colus without more desay
Shape us an answer to thyn aculement
And else I must proceed on thy Judgment
And even as Colus was onwarde to have said
For his ercuse. came in a messengere
Fro god Appollo to Pluto and him prayed
On-his behalf yt he without daungere
Would to him come and bring with him in fere
Dyana and Neptunus unto his banquet
And if they disdeyned hy^self he would them fet
Moreover he said the god Appollo
Desires to have respyt of the Judgment
Of Colus both of Mynos and Pluto
So Dyana and Neptunus were therewith content
And if they were disposyd to assent
That he might come unto his presence
He it desired to know his offense
What say ye herto said Pluto to them tweyn
Will ye both assente yt it shall be thus
Ye said the goddess for my part certain
And I also said this Neptunus
I am well plesyd quod this Colus
And when they had a while thus togyd spoke
Pluto commanded the court to be broke
And then together went they in fere
Pluto and Neptunus ledynge the goddess
Whom fololowed Cerberus with his prysonere
And alder last with great heaviness
Came I and Morpleus to the forteresse
Of the god Appollo unto his banquet
Where many goddys and goddesses met
When Appollo saw that they were come
He was right glad and prayed them to sit
Nay said Dyana this is all and some
Ye shall me perdone I shall not lyt yet
I shall first know why Colus abyt
And what execucyon shall on him be do
For his offense. well said Appollo
Madame ye shall have all your pleysere
Sith it woll none other wise be
But first I you pray let me the matere here
Why he is brought in this perplexyte
Well said Pluto. that shall ye soon see
And began to declare even by and by
Both there compleyntes ordynatly
And when Appollo had herd the report
Of Pluto in a manner smiling he said
I see well Colus. thou have small comfort
Thyself to excuse thou may be dismayed
To here so great compleyntes against the laid
That notwithstondyng if thou can say ought
For thyn own well. say and tarry naught
Forsooth said Colus if I had respyte
Herto an answer cowde I countrefete
But to have her grace more is my delight
Wherefore I pray you all for me entrete
yt I may by your request her good grace get
And what pain or greyf ye for me provide
Without any grutchyng I shall it abide
^oo good madame said god Appollo
What may he do more but sewe to your grace
Behold how the terys from his eyes go
It is satisfacco^n half for his trespace
Now glorious goddess show your pytous face
To this poor prisoner at my request
All we for your honor think thus is best
And if it like you to do in this wise
And to foryeue him clearly his offense
One thing surely I woll you promise
If he often rebelle and make resistance
Or disobeye unto your sentence
For every tree that he makyth fall
Out of the earth. an hu^dryd arise shall
So that your game shall not discrease
For lack of shade I dare undertake
Well sir Appollo said she then woll I sease
Of all my rancour and mercy with you make
And then god Neptunus of his matter spoke
Saying thus. Appollo though Dyana hy^ relese
Yet shall he sue to me to have his pese
A said Appollo ye wend I had foryete
You for my lady Dyana the goddess
Nay think not so for I woll you entrete
As well as her without long process
Will ye agree yt Phoebus your maystresse
May have the gydynge of your varyaunce
I shall abide quoth he her ordinance
Well then quoth Appollo I pray you goddis all Nota
And goddesses yt ben here present
That ye companably woll aborde fall
Nay then said Othea. it is not conuenyent
Adue order in every place is exspedyent
To be had wherefore ye may not let
To be your own marchall at your own banquet
And when Appollo see it would none other be
He called to him Aurora the goddess
And said though ye weep yet shall ye before me
Ay keep your course and put yourself in press
So he her set first at his own mess
With her moist clothes with terys all be spreynt
The meadows in may show thereof there co^pleynt
Next her sat Mars mighty god and strong
With a fla^me or tire enuyronned all about
A crown of yren on his heed a spear in hand
It semyd by his chere as he would have fouze
And next unto him as I perceive might
Sat the goddess Dyana in mantell fine
Of blak sylk purflyd with poudryd hermyne
Like as she had take the mantell and the ring
And next unto her arrayed ryally
Sat the god Jupiter in his demenynge
Full sad and wise he semyd sykerly
A crown of tynne stood on his heed
And yt I record of all phylosophres
That lytyl store of coin keep in there cofres
Joined to him in syttyng next there was
The goddess Juno full rychely beseene
In a sercote yt shone as bright as glass
Of goldsmythes work with spangles wrout by dene
Of ryal riches wantyd she non I wene
And next by her sat the god Saturn
That often time causith many one to morn
But he was clad me thought straungely
For of fro^^ and snow was all his array
In his hand he held a fawchon all blody
It semyd by his chere as he would make a fray
A baudrik of ysikles abowte his neck gay
He had. and above an high on his heed
Couchid with heylstones he ware a croune of leed
And next in order was set by his side
Ceres the goddess in a garmente
Of sakcloth made with sleues large and wide
Embroudryd with sheuys and sycklys bente
Of all manner greynes she scalyd the parente
In token that she was the goddess of corn
Old poets say she bears the heruest horn
Then was there set the god Cupido
All fresshe and galau^t and costly in array
With ouches and rings he was beset so
The palys thereof shone as thou it had be day
A kerchyf of pleysau^ce stood over his helm ay
The goddess Ceres he lokyd in the face
And with one arm he did her enbrace
Next to Cupido in order by and by
Of worldly wysdom sat the forteresse
Called Othea cheyf ground of polycy
Reweler of knighthede of prudence y^ goddess
Clad all in purpure was she more and less
Sauf on her heed a crown there stood
Couchyd with perlys oryent fine and good
And next to her was god Pluto set
With a derke mist enuyroned all about
His clothing was made of a smoky net
His color was both within and without
Full derke and dy^me his eyes great and stout
Of fire and sulphur all his odor waas
That woe was me while I beheld his faas
Fortune the goddess with her party face
Was unto Pluto next in order set
Varyaunt she was ay in short space
Her whele was ready to torn without let
Her go wne was of gaudy grene chamelet
Chaungeable of sundry diverse colors
To the condicyons acordynge of her shoures
And by her sat though he unworthy were
The rude god Pan of shepeherdes the gyde
Clad in russet frese and brechyd like a bear
With a great tarboxe hanging by his side
A shep^roke in his ho^de he spared for no pride
And at his fete lay a prykeryd curie
He ratelyd in the throat as he had the murie
Isys the goddess bare him company
For at the table next she sat by his side
In a close kyrtyll enbrowdexyd ^nryously
With branches and leuys broad large and wide
Giene as any grass in the somer tide
Of all manner fruit she had the governance
Of savors odoriferous was her sustynau^ce
Next her then was god Neptunus set
He sauored like a fyssher of hy^ I spoke before
It semyd by his clothes as they had be wet
About hy^ in his gyrdelstede hy^ge fysshes manya score
Of his strange array meruelyd I sore
A ship with a top and sail was his creste
Me thought he was gayly disgysed at yt feste
Then took Minerue the goddess her sete
Jointly to Neptunus all in curas clad
Gau^lett on her hondes and sabatou^s on her fete
She looked ever about as thou she had be mad
An hamer and a sithe on her heed she had
She wered two bokelers one by her side
That other ye wot where this was al her pride
Then came y^ god bachus and by her set hy^ down
Holding in his hand a cup full of wine
Of grene vine leuys he ware a Ioly cowne
He was clad in clustres of grapis good and fine
A garlonde of yuy he chose for his sign
On his heed he had a thredebare kendall hode
Algymlot and a fauset thereupon stood
Next him sat Phebns with her color pale
Fat she was of face but of complexyon feynt
She said she ruled neptunus and made hy^ to auale
And ones in y^ mo^th with phoebus was she mey^t
Also ne were she. Ceres were ateynt
Thus she sat and told the might of her nature
And on her heed she ware a crown of silver pure
Jointly to her Mercurins took his see
As came to his course witness the zodiake
He had a gylden tongue as fill for his degree
In eloquence of langage he passyd all the pake
For in his talkyng noman cowde find lake
A box with quyksyluer he had in his hand
Multiplyers know it well in every land
By hy^ sat dam^ Venus with color ciistallyne
Whose long here shone as wyre of gold bryt
Crispe was her skin and her eyes columbyne
Rauysshyd mine heart her chere was so light
Patroness of plesau^ce be named well she myt
A smock was her wede garnysshid curiously
But above all other she had a wanton ey
On her heed she ware a reed copre crown
A nosegay she had made full plesauntly
Betwyx her and Aurora. Appollo set hy^ down
With his beams bright he shone so fervently
That he therwyth gladed all the company
A crown of pure gold was on his heed set
In sign yt he was master and lord of yt banquet
Thus was y^ table set round about Nota
With goddys and goddesses as I have you told
Awaytynge on the boorde was a great route
Of sage philosophres and poets many fold
There was sad Sychero and Aristotle old
Tholome Dorethe and Dyogenes
Plato Messehala and wise Socrates
Sorts and Saphirus with Hermes stood behind
Auicen and Aueroys with them were in fire
Galien and Ypocras yt physyk have in mind
With help of Esculapion toward them drew ner^
Virgile Orace Ovid and Omet
Euclide and Alberte yaue there attendaunce
To do the gods and goddesses plesaunce
Hoar berded Orpheus was there with his harp
And as a poet musical made he melody
Other my^strel had they non^ saf Pan began carp^
Of his lewd bagpype yt caused the company
To lau. yet many mo were if I should not ly
Some young some old both better and werse
But mo of there names can I not rehearse
Of all manner deyntees there was habundau^ce
Of metis and drynkis foyson plenteuous
In came discord to have made va^ya^unce
But there was no rome to set her in y^ houe
The goddys remembryd the scysme odious
Among the three goddesses yt she had wrought
At the fest of Peleus wherefore they thought
They would not with her dele in adventure
Lest she them brought to some in conuenyent
She seeing this was wroth out of mesure
And in great wrath out of the paleys went
Saying to herself yt chere should they repent
And anon with Attropos happyd she to mete
As he had be a ghost came in a wy^dyng shete
She took hy^ by the hand and rowned in his ere
And told hy^ of the banquet yt was so delycate
Hou she was received and what chet had she thet
And how every god sat in his astate
Is it thus said Attropos what in deuylles date
Well he said I se well how the game gooth
Ones for your sake shall I make them wroth
And when she had him all together told
From her he departed and of her took his leave
Saying yt sor her sake his way take he would
In to the palace his matters to meue
And er he thens went he trowyd them to grene
With such tidings as he should them tell
So forth in he went and spoke words fell
When he came in the presence of the goddis all
As he had be wood he lokyd him about
His shete from his body down he let fall
And on a rude mauer he saluted all the route
With a bold voys carpyng words stout
But he spoke all holowe as it had be one
Had spoke in a another world y^ had woe begone
He stood forth boldly with grym countenance
Saying on this wise as ye shall here
All ye great goddys give attendaunce
Unto my words without all daungere
Remember how ye made me your offycere
All tho with my darte finally to chastyse
That you disobeyed or would your law dispyse
And for the more surete ye sealed my patent
Geuyng me full power so to occupy
What to I have enployed mine intent
And that can dame Nature well testyfy
If she be examyned she woll it not deny
For when she forsaky^h any creature
I am ay ready to take him to my cure
Thus have I ouely with all my dilygence
Executyd the office of old antiquite
To me by you grau^tid by your comin sentence
For I spared none high nor low degree
So that on my part no defawte has be
For as soon as any to me committed was
I smote him to y^ heart he had none other gras
Ecto^ of Troy for all his chyualry
Alerandre the great and mighty conqueror
Julius Caesar with all his company
David nor Iosue nor worthy Artour
Charles the noble y^ was so great of honor
Or Judas Machabee for all his true heart
Nor Godfrey of Boleyn cowde me not astert
Nabugodonozor for all his great prode
Nor the king of Egypt the cruel ^harao
Jason ne hercules went they never so wide
Cosdras hanyball nor gentle Sypyo
Cyrus Achylles or many a another ^^o
For seyre or foul gate of me no grace
But al be at the last. I sesed them with my mace
Thus have I brought every creature
To an end both man fysshe foul and be^st
And every other thing in whom dame nature
Has any Iurisdycco^n etheyr most or leest
Except oonly one in whom your beheest
Is to me broke for ye me promised
That my myt of non should have be despised
When of the contrary dare I well auowe
Is true for one there is that woll not apply
Unto my correccion nor in no wise bow
To the dynt of my dart for dole nor desteny
What comfort he has nor the cause why
That he so rebellyth I can not think of ryt
But if ye have hy^ grau^tid your alders safcondyght
And if ye so have then do ye not as goddys
For a goddys writing may not reuersyd be
If it should I would not give two pesecoddis
For grant of your patent of office nere of fee
Wherefore in this matere do me equytee
According to my patent. for till this be do
Ye have nomo and my seruise ne my good wylloo
And when all y^ goddys had Attropos herd
As they had be wood they brayde up attonys
And said the^ would not rest til he were conquered
Taken and distroyed body blood and bones
And y^ they swore great oaths for the nones
There law to dispyse y^ was so malapert
They said he should be taught for to be so pert
Well said Appollo if he on the earth be
With my brennyng chare I shall him confound
In faith quoth Neptunus and if he keep the sea
He may be full sure. he shall soon be drownde
A sir said Mars this have we well fownde
That any disobeyed our godly precept
We may well think we have to long slept
But nevertheless where I may him find
With thond and lyghtnyng about I shall him chase
And I quoth Satnrnus before and behind
With my bitter cold shall show hy^ hard grace
Well said Mercurius if I may see his face
For ever of his speech I shall him depryue
So y^ him were better be deed than a live
Ye quod Othea yet way he well be
In the air where he will and axe you no leave
Wherefore my counsel is that all we
May entreat Neptunus his rancour to foryeue
And then I dout not Colus will him myscheue
So may ye be sure he shall you not escape
And else of all your anger woll he make but a Iape
But for to tell you how Col^s was brought
In danger of Pluto yet had I forgete
Wherefore on this matere ferder woll I naught
Proceed till I thereof have knowledge you let
It fell on a day the weder was wete
And Colus thought he would on his disport
Goo to rejoice his spyrytes and comfort
He thout he would se what was in the ground
And in crauers forth he began him dress
A drowthe had the earth late before found
That caused it to chy^ne and crase more and less
Suddenly by weet constreyned by duresse
Was the ground to close his superficial face
So streyte y^ to escape Colus had no space
This seeing Colus he still within abode
Sekyng where he myt have gon^ out fer or nere
Anon he was aspyed and one to Pluto rode
And told hy^ how Colus was in his daungere
Then said he to Cerberus fet me yt prysonere
Till I have hy^ seen let him not go at large
As thou wolt answer of him I give y^ charge
Thus was this Colus take prisoner
Then happyd it so yt the same day
Pluto had prefyxed for a great matter
Mynos to sit in his robe of raye
Wherefore Cerberus took the next way
And lad hy^ to the place where the cour^ shall be
Whed as I told you Morpleus brought me
So thither came Dyana carried in a carre
To make her compleynt as I told you all
and so did Neptunus y^ does both make and mar^e
Walowyng with his wawes and to^blyng as a ball
There ma^s they meued fall what may befall
There was the first sight yt ever I them saw
And if I never do eft I recke not a straw
But now to my matere to return again
And to begin new. where I left
When all the goddys had done there besy pay^
They weyte to contryue how he should be reft
Of his life yt Attropos had no cause eft
To co^pleyn. then Phoebus stert upon her fete
And said I pray you let me speak a word yete
Othea menyth well to say on this wise
But al to entrete Neptunus I hope shall not need
Mesemyth I alone durst take ye enterprise
Er I am begyled or else I shall speed
How say ye Neptunus shall I do this deed
Will ye your rancour sesse at my request
Madame quoth he rulyth me as you lyketh best
Gramercy said she of your good will
That it pleases you to show me that fa^our
Wherefore the goddys hye pleasure to fulfill
Perform my desire* and leave all old rancour
Foral our alders well and saving of our honor
Again this Colus yt ye long have had
It is done quoth he forsooth then am I glad
Said he now then Colus be y^ to us true
^repe well the air and our great rebel
May we then soon ever to us subdew
Yes and that quod Colus shall ye here tell
Nowhere in the air shall he rest nor dwell
If he do thereof put me in the fawte
With my bitter blastes. so shall I hy^ assawte
What said the god Pluto what is his name
That thus presumyth agay^ us to rebel
Virtue quoth attropos y^ have he much shame
He is never confounded. thus of him here I tell
A said this Pluto. in deed I know him well
He has be ever mine utter e^e^ye
Wherefore this matter again him take woll I
For all the baytes y^ ye for him have laid
Without mine help ben not worth a pe^^e
For though ye all the contrary had said
Yet would he bread ryt nyghe your althers ere
No manner of thing can hy^ hurt nor dear
Save oonly one a sont of my bastard
Whose name is Syce he kepyth my vawarde
Wherefore you Cerberus now I y^ discharge
Of Colus. and woll that thou hither fette
My dear sone vice and say that I him charge
That he to me come without any let
Armyd all poynt^^. for a day is set
That he with virtue for all the goddys sake
In our defense. must on him bataylle ta^^e
Forth then went Cerberus with his fyry chey^^e
And brought thyd vice as he ^^^na^ded was
Again noble virtue y^ battle to dereygne
On a glydyng serpent ryd^ng a great ^as
Formed like a dragon scalid hard as glass
Whoos mouth flamyd fire without fayll
Wings had it serpentyne and a long tayll
Armed was vice all ^^ ^^e bo^ie
Hard as any borne blacker ferrt than so^^
An ungoodly sort followed him parde
Of unhappy capteyns of myscheyf crop and ^ote
Pride was y^ first. y^ next him rode god (...)te
On a roryng lion. next whom came envy
Syttyng on a (...)f he had a scornful ey
Wrath bestrode a wyld bore and next hy^ began ride
In his hand he bare a blody na^^yd s^^crde
Next whom came couetyse y^ goth so fer and wide
Ridyng on an oliphaflt as he had been aferde
After whom to de gloteny with his fat berde
Sitting on a bear wish his great belly
And next him on a got folowyd lechery
Sloth was so slepy he came all behind
On a dulle ass a full weary pase
These were the captey^^^ y^ vice cowde find
Best to set his field and follow on the chase
As for pety capteyns many mother wase
^^ sacrilege symony and dyssy^^^lacyon

Idylnesse s^t the coruyn^ to array
Without the palayes on a fayt field
But there was an host for to make a fraye

Of sy^ne great claypers and makers of damours
Vnthrystes and vnlustes came also to that game
With luskes and losellis y^ myt not thryue for sham^
These were the comyns came thyd y^ day
Ready bowne in battle virtue to abide
Appollo them beholding began for to say
To the gods and goddesses being there y^ tide
Me semyth conuenyent an herowde to ride
To virtue and bid to battle make him bone
Hy^self to defend forsooth it shall be sone
And let him not be suddenly take
All dispurueyed or then he be ware
For th^^^^e should our dishonor awake
If he were cowardly take in a snare
Ye quod vice, for y^ have I no care
I woll advantage take where I may
That herynge Morpleus p^^uely stale away
And went to warn virtue of all this afray
And bad him awake and make hy^self strong
For he was like to endure that day
A great mortal shoure ^^^^ were euesonge
With vice wherefore he bad him not long
Tarry to send after more socour
If he did it should turn him to dolor
And briefly the matere to him he declared
Like as ye have herd beginning and end
Well quod virtue be shall not be spared
To the fride I woll wend how it wend
But gramercy Morpleus mine own dear friend
Of your true heart and faithful intent
That ye in this matter to mewarde have meant
This done Morpleus departed away
Fro virtue to y^ palace recornyng again
None him aspyed y^ I dare well say
Io which time virtue did his besy pain
People to reyse his querell to mentayn
Ymaginaco^n was his messengere
He went to warn people both f^^e and ne^e
And had them come in all the have they might
For to strength Virtue for without fayll
He said he should have long er it were night
With Vice to do a mighty strong battle
Of vngraycous gestes he brings a long tail
Wherefore it behouyth to help at this need
And after this shall Virtue reward your mede
When Ymagynaco^n had goon his cyrcuyte
To Virtues frendis thus all about
wtin short time many men of might
Gadryd to virtue in all that they moute
They him comfortid and bad him put no doubt
His utter enmye Vice to overthrow
Thou he with hy^ brought never so great arowe
And when virtue se the substance of his host
He prayed all the comyus to the field them hye
With there pety capteyns both leest and most
And with his capteyns should follow redyly
For he said he knew well y^ Vice was full ny
and who might first of y^ field recover the center
Would keep out ye other he should not esely enter
Then sent he forth baptym to the field before
And prayed him hertly it to ouerse
That nomaner train nor caltrop therein were
To noye nor hurt him nor his meyne
And when he thither came he began to se
How Vice his purseuaunt crime orygynall
Was entered before and had seized up all
But as soon as hereof Baptym had a sight
He fled fast away and left the field alone
And anon baptym entered with his might
Serching al about where this crime had gone
But y^ field was clean defawte fond he none
Then came virtue after with his great host
And his mighty capytayns both lest and most
But to enfourme you how he thither came
And what manner capiteyns he to y^ feld brout
Himself sykerly was the first man
Of all his great host yt thyderwarde songht
Syttyng in a chare yt rychely was wrought
With gold and perles and gemmes precious
crowned with laurer as lord vyctoryous
Four doughty knights abowte y^ chare went
At every corner one it for to gyde
And convey acordyng to virtues intent
At the first corner was ryghtwysnesse yt tide
Prudence at the second was set to abide
At y^ third strength y^ fourth kept temperaunce
These the chare gyded to virtues plesaunce
Next to the chare. vij. capiteyns there rode
Echone after other in order by and by
Humylyte was the first a lamb he bestrode
With countenauce de^^re he rode full soberly
A fawcon gentle stood on his helm an hy
And next after him came there charity
Rydyng on a tygre as fill to his degree
Rody as a rose ay he kept his chere
On his helm an high a pellp^^n he bare
Next who^ came patience y^ nowhef has no pet
On a camel ridynge as boyde of all care
A femx on his helm stood so forth began he fare
Who next him folowyd but lyberalyte
Sittyg on a drom^^an yt was both good and fre
On his helm for his crest he bare an ospray
And next after him followed abstynence
Riding on an heart was tiappured and agy
He s^myd a lord of right great excellence
A popymay was his crest he was of great defense
Next hy^ followed chastity on an unicorn
Aimed at all points behind and beforne
A turtyldoue he bare on hye for his crest
Then came good business last of those. vij.
Ridyng on a pantere a sundry colored best
Gloryously beseen as he had come fro heaven
A crane on his heed stood his crest for to steven
All these. vij. capteyns had standards of price
Each of them according after his deuyse
Many pety capteyns after these went
As true faith and hope mercy peace and pity
Right troth meekness with good intent
Goodness concord and perfyte unity
Honest true love with symplycite
Prayer fasting preuy almesdede
Joined with the artycles of the creed
Confession contrico^n and satisfacco^n
With sorrow for sin and great repentance
Foryeuenesse of trespass with good disposyco^n
Resystence of wrong performyng of penance
Holy devotion with good contynuaunce
Presthode them followed with the sacramentis
And sadness also with the co^niau^dementis
Suffraunce in trowble with Innocence
Clennesse contynence and vyrgynyte
^yn^nesse reverence with curtesy
Content and plesyd with pyteous pouerte
Entendyng well mynystryng equity
Twene right and wrong hole Indifferency
And labouryng the seruyse of god to multiply
Refure of richesse and worldly vaynglory
Perfecco^n with perfyt contemplaco^n
Relygyon professyon well kept in memory
Very dread of god with holy predycaco^n
Celestyall sapyence with ghostly Inspyraco^n
Grace was the gyde of all this great meyny
Whom followed cu^nynge with his genealogy
That is to say gramer and sophistry
Philosophy natural logyk and rethoryk
Arsmetryk geometry with astronomy
Canon and cyuile melodyous musyk
Noble theology and corporal physyk
Moralyzaco^n of holy scripture
Profounde poetry and drawyng of pycture
These followed cu^nyng and thither with him ^^m
With many one mo offryng there seruyse
To virtue at yt need but notwithstondyng that
Some he refusyd and said in no wise
They should with him go and as I cowde auyse
These were there names first nygramancy
Geomancy magyk and glotony
Adriomancy ornomancy with piromancy
Fysenomy also and palmestry
And all there sequelys if I shall not ly
Yet cu^nynge prayed virtue he would not deny
Them for to know nor disdeyne with his ey
On them to look whereto virtue granted
Hou be it in his werres he would not they hau^ted
So bad they cu^nyng lightly to depart
From virtues field and they seeng this
By common assent hired them a carte
And made them be carried toward vice ywys
Frothensforth to serve hy^ they would not mys
Full loath they werr to be maysterles
Instead of better the worse there they ches
But forth to relese all the remenaunt
Of pety capteyns yt with virtue were
Moderate dyete and wysdom auenaunt
Even wit and mesure ware of contagyous gere
Loath to ofende and loving ay to lere
Worship and profyt with myrthe in manner
Thise pety capteyns with virtue were in fere
Comens them followed a great multitude
But in comparyson to that other side
I trow there was not brefely to conclude
The tenth man that battle to abide
Yet nevertheless I shall not fro you hyde
What manner people they were and of what sect
As nere as my wit thereto will me dyrecte
There were notable and famous doctors
Example yeuers of living gracyous
Perpetuell pcestis and dyscrete confessors
Of holy scripture declarers fructuons
Rebukers of sin and myscheues odyous
Fysshers of souls and lovers of clennes
Dispysers of veyn and worldly riches
Peasyble prelates Iusticiall governors
Founds of chyrches with mercyful pecres
Reformers of wrong of there progenytours
On paynfull poor pyteous compassyoneres
Well menyng merchants with true artyfyceres
Virgyns pure and also Innocents
Holy matrones with chaste contynentes
Pylgryms and palmers with true laborers
Holy heremytes good solycitours
Monasterial monks and well disposyd freres
Chanons and nonnes faithful professors
Of worldly people true coniugatours
Lovers of Criste confounders of ill
And all yt to godwarde give her good will
Mayntenours of right very penytentis
Distroyers of error causers of unity
True actyfe lyuers yt set there ententis
The deeds to perform of mercy and pity
Contemplatyf people yt desire to be
Solytary servants unto god allone
Rad than to habou^de in richesse enerychone
These with many mo than I reherce can
Were come thither ready y^ battle to abide
And take such part as fill to virtue than
Vice to overcome they hoped for all his pride
All though yt he had more people on his side
For the men yt virtue had were full sure
To trust on at need and cu^nynge in armure
Macrocosme was the name of the field
Where this great battle was set for to be
In y^ mids thereof stood conscience and beheld
Which of them should be brought to captiuyte
Of yt noble-tryumphe Judge would he be
Synderesys sat him wtin closed in a park
with his tables in his hand there deeds to mark
To come in to the field were high ways five
Free to both parties large broad and wide
Virtue would not tarry but hyed hy^ thyd blyue
Leest he were by vice disceyued at that tide
Long out of the field loathe he was to abide
In adventure yt he out of it were not kept
For then would he think he had to long slept
This mean time while virtue thus provided
For him and his people the field for to win
He chargyd every man by grace to be gyded
And all y^ ever might the field to enter in
In all that season went orygynall sin
To let vice know how baptym with his host
Had entered macrocosme and serched every cost
A said vice then see I well it is time
Baners to display and standards to auaunce
Almost tolong had thou tarried crime
To let us have knowledge of this purueau^ce
Yet I trow I shall learn him a new da^^ce
Wherefore I command you all without delay
Toward y^ field draw in all the have ye may
Then said y^ god Pluto yt all men might here
Vice I the charge as thou wolt eschew
Our heuyous Indygnaco^n you draw not arere
But put the forth boldly to overthrow vertew
In faith quod attropos and I shall after sew
For if he escape your hondes this day
I tell. you my service have lost for ay
Forth then rode vice with all his hole strength
On his stead serpentyne as I told you before
The host y^ him followed was of great length
Among who^ were penou^s and gnitors many a scot
But er he went thydward I shall you tell mot
Of his pety capitayns he made many a knyt
For they should not fle but manly with him fyt
He dubbyd falshode with dissymulaco^n
Symony usury wrong and rybawdy
Malice disceyte lie without extorco^n
Perjury diffydence and apostasy
With boldness in ill to bear them company
These. xiiij. knights made vice that day
To wy^ne there spores they said they would assay
In like wise virtue dubbyd on his side
Of his pety capteyns other fourtene
Which made there auow with him to abide
There spores would they wy^ne yt day it should be seen
Thise were there names if it be as I wene
Faith hope and mercy troth and also right
With resystence of wrong a full hayrdy wit
Confession contricyon with satysfaccyon
Very dread of god perfourmynge of penance
Perfecco^n cunning and good dysposyco^n
And all knytte to virtue they were by alyau^ce
Wherefore to him they made assurance
That field to keep as long as they might
And in this querell again vice to fight
The lord of macrocosme and ruler of that fee
Was called frewyll chaunger of the chance
To whom virtue sent embassatours three
Reason discrecyon and good remembrance
and prayed hy^ be favorable his honor tenhau^ce
For but he had his favor at yt point of need
He stood in great doubt he could not lytly speed
In like wise vice embassatours three
For his party unto frewyll sent
Temptaco^n folly and sensualyte
Prayeng him of favor yt he would assent
To him as he would at his commandment
Have him eft sonys when he list to call
On hy^ for any thing yt afterward myt fall
Ansuere yaue he none to neither party
Save oonly he said the battle would he se
To wit which of them should have y^ victory
It hynge in his balaunce the ambyguyte
He said he would not restreyne his lyberte
When he came where sorrow should awake
Then it should be know what part he would take
When virtue and vice by there ambassatours
Knew of this answer they stood in great doubt
Netheles they said they would endure tho shours
and make an end shortli of yt they went about
So forth came vice with all his great route
Er he came at the field he sent yet pryuely
Sensualyte before in manner of a spy
Which sewe the field with his unkind sede
That caused virtue after much woe to feel
For thereof grew nonght but all oonly wede
Which made the ground as slypper as an ele
He went again to vice and to ^de him every dele
How he had done and bad him come away
For he had so purueyd yt vice should have yt day
So as it happed at the field they mete
Frewyll virtue and vice as tripartyte
Saaf virtue a lyll before the field had get
And else his auau^tage forsooth had be full light
Not for then encombred so was never wight
As virtue and his men were with the rank wede
That in the field grew of sensualytees sede
But as soon as vice of virtue had a sight
He began swage gonnnes as he had been wede
That heryng virtue commanded every wight
To pauyse him under the sign of the rode
and bad them not dread. but keep still where they stood
It was but a shoure should sone confou^de
Wherefore he commanded them stand and keep there ground
Aod when vice came nere to the field
He called sore for bows and bad them shote fast
But virtue and his meyne bare of with the shield
Of y^ blessed tri^y^e ay till shot was past
and when shot was done vice came forth at last
Purposyng the field with assawte to win
but virtue kept it long he myt not enter therein
All yt time frewyll stood and him bethought
To which he myt leave and what part he would take
At last sensualite had him so far brout
y^ he said plainly he virtue would forsake
And in vices quarrel all his power make
I wys quoth reason yt is not for the best
No forse said frewyll I will do as me list
Virtue was full heavy when he se frewyll
Take part with vice but yet nevertheless
He did yt he might the field to keep still
Till vice with frewyll so sore began him oppress
That he was constreyned clearly by duresse
A little tyne abacke to make abew retret
All thing consydred it was the best feet
First to remember how vices part was
Ten against one stronger by lyklynesse
And then how frewyll was with him alas
who cowde deem virtue but in heuinesse
Morcouer to think how yt slyper grass
That of sensualyte his unkind sede grew
Under foot in stondyng encombred vertew
Yet notwythstondyng virtues men all
Nobely them bare and faught myghtely
How be it the slypper glass made many of he^ fall
And from thens in manner depart suddenly
yt seeng vices host began to shoute and cry
and said on in plutoes name on and al is our
For this day shall vice be made a conqueroure
Thus virtue was by might of vice and frewyll
Driven out of the field it was the more pity
How be it yet baptim kept his ground still
And with him abode faith hope and unity
And cu^nynge also with comyns a great meyne
Confession contrico^n were ready at there hand
And satysfacco^n vice to wythstonde
But all the time while virtue was away
A mighty conflict kept they with vices route
And yet nevertheless for all yt great affray
Hope stood vpryght and faith would never loute
And evermore said baptym syres put no doubt
Verte shall return and have his entente
This field shall be ours and else let me be shent
and while thise pety captey^s sustained thus ye feld
with virtue his reward came good perseuerau^ce
An huge mighty host and when he beheld
How virtue hy^ wythdrew he took displesau^ce
and wha^ he to hy^ cam^ he said ye shall your chance
Take as it falls wherefore return ye must
Yet ones for your sake with vice shall I Just
Alas that ever ye should lose thus your honor
And therwyth also y^ high perpetuell crown
Which is for you kept in the celestyall tour
Wherefore be ye called Cristis champyone
How is it that ye have no compassyone
On baptysme faith and hope cu^nynge and unity
yt stand so hard bestad and fight as ye may see
All the tresour erthly under the fyrmament
That ever was made of goddis creaco^n
To reward them euynly were not equyualent
For there noble labor in his afflycco^n
Wherefore take upon you your Iurisdicco^n
Rescu yonder knights and recontynu fight
and else a du your crown for all your great myt
with these and such words as I have you told
By good perseuerau^ce vttred in this wise
Virtue him remembered and began to wexe bold
And said yone true knights to rescu I auyse
Let us no longer tarry from this enterprise
Again to the field so virtue returned
yt caused hem be merry yt long aforhad morned
Auaunt baner quod he in the name of Ihesu
And with that his people set up a great shoute
And cried with a loud voys a virtue a virtue
There began vices host for to look about
But I trow perseuerau^ce was not long without
He bathed his sword in his foes blood
The boldest of them all not ones him wtstood
Constau^ce him followed and brought hy^ his spet
But when perseuerau^ce saw vice on his stead
Noman cowde him let till he came there
For to bid him ride I trow it was no need
All virtues host prayed for his good speed
Again vice he rode with his great shaft
And him ouerthrewe for all his subtle craft
That seeng frewyll came to conscience
And began him to repent yt he with him had be
Prayeng him of counseyl for his great offense
That he against virtue had made his arm
What was best to do to humylyte
Quoth conscience must you go so he hy^ thither sent
Dysguysed yt he were not known as he went
And when he thyd came humylyte him took
A token and bad him goo to confession
And show him his matere with a pyteous look
Which done he him sent to contryco^n
And fro thensforth to s^tysfacco^n
Thus fro post to pylar was he made to dance
And at last he went forth to penance
But now to tell when vice was overthrow
A great part of his host abowte hy^ began resort
But he was so feeble yt he cowde noman know
And when they se yt they knew no comfort
But carried him away by a preuy port
And as they hy^ carried dispeyre with him met
with vice his reward he came them for to fet
Then came there down goodly ladies tweyne
From the hye heaven above the fyrmament
And said yt great Alpha and o most souereyn
For yt noble tryumphe had them thither sent
One of them to drive vice to great torment
With a fire strong yt she bare in her hand
And so he did dispeyre and all his hoole bond
The name of this lady was called Prestience
She never left vice ne none yt would hy^ follow
Till they were committed by y^ dyuyne sentence
All to pain perpetuel and Infynyte sorrow
Rytwysnes went to se yt no man should he^ borow
Thus al entretyd sharply were they till cerberus
Had them beshyt within his yates tenebrus
and all yt while ye prestience with her scourge smert
To reward vice began her thus occupy
With all his hole bend after there desert
y^ other glorious lady yt came fro heaven on hy
Having in her hand the palm of vyctory
Came down to virtue and took hy^ to the present
Saying thus yt Alpha and oo has him sent
And as far as I a right cowde vndstonde
That ladies name was Predestinacyon
Virtue and his host she blessed with her hand
And in heaven grauntid them habitacion
Whereto each of them reseruyd was a crown
She said in token yt they Inherytours
Of the glory were and gracious conquerous
Which done the ladies togyd again met
And toward heaven up they began to ^^y
Embraced in armies as they had be knet
Together with a gyrdyll but so suddenly
As they were vanishid saw I never thy^g with ey
And anon virtue with all his company
Knelyd down and thankyd god of yt vyctory
Yet had I ^oryete when vice was over throw
To have told you how many of vices host
Began to seek peace and darkyd down full low
And besought mercy what so ever it cost
To be there mean to virtue else they were but lost
and some in like wise to faith and hope sought
What to do for peace they said they ne rought
Some also to baptym sewed to be there mean
Some to one some to other as them get might
but all to confession went to make them clean
and as they came to conscience he the^ bad go lyt
Er than old attropos of them had a sight
For if he so them took lost they were for ever
He said vice to forsake is better late tha^ never
Some eke for socour drew to circn^cisyon
But by hy^ cowde they get but small favor
For he in the company was had but in derysyon
Nevertheless to faith he bad them go labor
Prayeng them for old aquey^tau^ce them socour
Well quoth faith for his sake I shall do yt I may do
But first to y^ best way baptym go ye to
For by him sonest shall ye recover grace
Which shall to virtue bring you by process
Wherefore in any wise look ye make good face
And let no man know of your heaviness
So they were by bapty^ brought out of dystresse
Tomed al to virtue and when this was done
Virtue commanded Frewyll before him come
To whom thus he said I have great merueyll
Ye durst be so bold vices part to take
Who bad you do so and yaue you y^ counseyll
Justly unto yt ye shall me preuy make
Then said frewyll and swemfully spoke
Knelyng on his knee with a chere benygne
I pray you sir let pity your eres to me e^nclyne
And I shall you tell the very soth of all
How it was and who made me y^ way draw
Forsooth Sensualyte his propre name they call
A said Reason then know I well yt fellow
Wild he is and wanton of me stant hy^ nou^ awe
Is he so quoth Virtue well he shall be taught
As a playr should to draw a another draught
And with yt came Sadness with his sobre chere
Bryngyng Sensualyte being full of thought
And said yt he had take him prysonere
A welcome said virtue now have I y^ I sought
Blessed be yt good lord as you would is it naught
Whi art y^ so wanton and wyld he said for sham^
Er you goo at large you shall be made more tame
S^ond a part a while till I have spoke a word
With Frewyll a little and then shall you know
what shall be thy fynau^ce and then said in board
Unto Frewyll they ben of your bow
Begins to slake but such as ye have sow
Must ye needs repe there is none other way
Notwythstondyng yt let se what ye can say
What is your habylyte me to recompense
For the great harm y^ ye to me have do
Forsooth said Frewyll in open audyence
But only Macrocosme more have I not lo
Take that if it pleyse you I woll yt it be so
If I may vndstonde ye be my good lord
In deed said virtue to that woll I acorde
Then made virtue reason his lyeftenaunt
and yaue hy^ a great charge macrocosme to keep
That done sensualyte yield him recreaunt
And began for anger hytterly to weep
For he denyd surely his sorrow should not sleep
Then made virtue fre^yll bayll vnd reason
The field to ocupy to his behoue yt season
And then said virtue to sensualyte
Thou shall be rewarded for thy business
Under this form all fragylyte
Shall thou forsake both more and less
And vnd the gydyng shall you be of sadness
All though it somewhat be against thy heart
Thy Judgment is yeuen yushalt it not astert
And even with yt came in dame Nature
Saying thus to virtue sir ye do me wrong
By duresse and constreynt to put this creature
Gentle sensualyte yt has me served long
Clearly from his lyberte and set him among
Them y^ love him not to be there vndlowte
As it were a cast a way or a shoo clowte
And parde ye know well a rule have I must
wtin macrocosme forsooth I say not nay
Quoth virtue but se^sualite shalnot perform^ your lust
Like as he has do before this if I may
Therfro him restreyn sadness shall assay
How be it ye shall have your hole lyberte
Within macrocosme as ye have had free
And when virtue had to nature said thus
A little tyne his ey castyng him beside
He saw in a corner stondyng morpleus
That him before warnyd of the verily tide
A syres said virtue yet we must abide
Here is a friend of ours may not be foryete
After his deserte we shall him entrete
Morpleus said virtue I thank you hertly
For your true heart and your great labor
That ye list to come to me so redely
When ye vndstode the coming of yt shour
I thank god and you of saving of mine houour
Wherefore this preuylege now to you I gran^t
That wtin macrocosme ye shall have your hau^t
And of. v. posternes the keys shall ye keep
Lettyng in and out at them whom ye list
As long as in macrocosme your fad will crepe
Blere whose ey ye will hardly with your mist
And keep your works close there as in a chyst
Saaf I would desire you spare polluco^n
For nothy^ge may me plese y^ souneth to corrupco^n
and when he had thus said the keys he hy^ took
And toward his castle with his people went
Biddy^g reason take good head and abowte look
That sensualyte by nature were not shent
Keep him short he said till his lust be spent
For better were a child to be vnbore
Than let hy^ have the will and for ever be lo^re
and when old attropos had seen and herd all this
How virtue had opteyned astonyed as he stood
He said to himself somewhat there is amys
I trow well my patent be not all good
And ran to the palace as he had be wood
Saying to the goddis I se ye do but Iape
After a worthy whew have ye made me gape
How a devil way should I virtue overthrow
When he dredyth not all your hole rowte
Hou can ye make good your pate^t would I know
It is to impossyble to bring that abowte
For stryke hy^ may I not yt is out of doubt
A good attropos said god appollo
An ansuere conuenyent shall you have herto
The words of thy patent dare I well say
Streche to no ferd but where dame nature
Has Iurisdycco^n there to have thy way
And largess to stryke as longs to thy cure
And as for virtue he is no creature
Vnd thy predycament contained of quantyte
Wherefore his distrucco^n longs not to the
A ha said attropos then see I well
That all the goddis be but countrefete
For oo god there is yt can euerydell
Torn as him list both dry and wete
In to whose seruyse I shall assaye to get
And if I may onys to his service come
Your names shall be put in oblyuyont
Thus went attropos fro the palace wrooth
But in the mean time while that he thef was
Glydynge by ye palace residyuaco^n gooth
Toward macrocosme with a peynted face
Clad like a pilgrim walkyng a great pace
In the form as he had be a man of Ynde
He wend have made reason and sadness both bly^de
With sensualyte was he soon aqueynted
To whom he declared his matter pryuely
Yet he was espied for all his face peynted
Then reason commanded him pyke thens lytly
For his ease quoth sadness so counsel him woll I
So was sensualyte ay kept under foot
That to residytiaco^n might he do no bote
Then went he to nature and asked her auyse
His intent to opteyne what was best to do
She said ever sith virtue of vice wan y^ price
Reason with sadness has ruled the field so
That I and sensualyte may little for the do
For I may no more but oonly keep my course
And yet is sensualyte strenger keep and wours
Thus hery^g ^e^idiuaco^n frothens he went again
Full of thou^ and sorrow y^ he might not speed
Then reason and sadness took wedehokes tweyn
and al wild wantons out of y^ field began wede
With all the slyper grass yt grew of the sede
That sensualyte before therein sewe
And fro thens forth kept it clean for vertewe
Then began new grass in the field to spry^g
All unlike yt other of color fair and bright
But then I aspyed a marvelous thing
For y^ ground of y^ field began were hoar and white
I cowde not consceyue how y^ he might
Till I was ^nformyd and taught it to know
but where virtue ocupieth must needs well grow
Yet in mean time while the field thus grew
and reason with sadness had thereof governance
Many a preuy messenger thyd sent vertew
To know if it were gyded to his plesau^ce
Now prayer often fasting and often time penance
And when he might goo pryuely almesdede
and bad hy^ to his power help where he se need
While y^ field thus ruled reason with sadness
Maugre dame nature for all her carnal myt
Came thyd attropos void of all gladness
Wrappyd in his shete and axyd if any wight
Cowde wyssh hy^ the way to the lord of light
Or else where men myt find ryghtwysnesse
For^oth said reason I trow as I guess
At virtues castle ye may sooue him find
If ye list the labor thither to take
And there shall ye know if ye be not blind
The next way to the lord of light I vndtake
So thither went attropos petycyon to make
To ryghtwysnesse prayeng that he might
Betake in to the service of the lord of light
What said ryghtwysnesse y^ old dotyng fool
Whom have y^ served sith the world began
But only him where have y^ goo to scole
Whether art y^ double or else the same man
That y^ were first a sir said he than
I pray you hertly hold me excusyd
I am old and feeble my wits are dysusyd
Well said ryghtwysnesse for asmoche as thou
knowyst not the master thy nam^ shall I change
Death shall y^ be called from hens forward now
Among all the people y^ shall be had strange
But when y^ begynnest to make thy chalau^ge
Drad shall thou be where so thou become
And to n^ creature shall y^ be welcome
And for them whom y^ dydest serve
For as much as they presume on them to take
y^ high name of god they shall as they deserve
Therefore be rewarded I dare undertake
With pain perpetuell among fendes blake
And there names shall be put to oblyuyo^
Among men but it be in derysyon
A ha said attropos now begin I wexe glad
That I shall thus avenged of them be
Sith they so long time have made me so ^ad
Ye quod ryghtwysnesse here what I say to the
The lord of light sent the word by me
That in macrocosme sesyne shall thou take
Wherefore thy darte ready look thou make
And as soon as virtue y^ vndstode
He said he was pleysyd y^ it should so be
And even forthwyth he commanded presthode
To make him ready the field for to se
So thither went presthode with benygnyte
Conueyeng thither the blessed sacrament
Of Eukarist but first were thither sent
Confession contricyon and satysfaccyon
Sorrow for sy^ne and great repentance Nota
Holy devotion with good disposycyon
All these thither came and also penance
As her dewte was to make purueau^ce
Again the coming of that blessed lord
Faith hope and charity thereto were acorde
Reason with sadness did his dylygence
To cleanse the field within and whthout
And when they se the bodyly presence
Of yt holy Eukarist lowly began they loute
So was y^ lord received out of doubt
With all humble chere debonayre and benygne
Lykly to his pleasure it was a great sign
Then came to y^ field the mynyster fynall
Called holy vncco^n with a crismatory
The five hye ways in especyall
Thereof he anointed and made it sanctuary
Whom followed death which would not tarry
His fervent power there to put in ure
As he was commanded grau^tyng dame nature
He took his darte called his mortal lau^ce
And bent his stroke toward the feldes heart
That seeng presthode bad good remembrance
Toward the field torn him and aduerte
For except him all virtues thense must sterte
And even whth yt death there sesyne took
And then all the c^mpany clearly it forsook
And as soon as death thus had sesyne take
The color of the field was changed suddenly
The grass therein sere as thouh it had be bake
And the five hye ways were mured upon hy
y^ fro thensforwarde none enter should thereby
The posternes were also without let
Both Inward and outward fine fast shette
Which done suddenly death vanysshyd away
And virtue exaltyd was above the fyrmament
Where he took the crown of glory y^ is ay
Preparate by Alpha and oo omnypotent
y^ sweet fruit of macrocosme thyd with hy^ went
And on all this matter as I stood musyng thus
Again fro the field to me came morpleus
Saying thus what chere how likes y^ this fyt
Have thou seen enough or will y^ se more
Nay sire I said my troth I you plyght
This is suffycyent if I knew wherefore
This was to me showed for thereof the lord
Coueyte I to have if I get might
Follow me quoth he and have thy delyght
So I him followed till he had me brought
To a fouresqare herber walled round about
Loo quoth morpleus here may ^ that y^ sought
Find if thou will I put the out of doubt
A little while we stood still there without
Till wit cheyf porter of yt herber gate
Required by study let us in there ate
But when I came I meruelyd greatly
Of that I beheld and herd there report
For first in a chare apparaylled ryally
There sat dame doctrine her chyldn to exhort
And about her was many a sundry sort
Some willing to learn diverse s^yence
And some for to have pertyte Intelligence
Crowned she was like an emperesse
With. iij. crowns stondyng on her heed on ^y
All thing abowte her an Infynyte process
Were to declare I tell you certainly
Nevertheless some in mind thereof have I
Which I shall to you as god will give me grace
As I saw and herd tell in short space
Fast by doctrine on that one side
As I remember sat holy text
That opened his mouth to the people wide
But not in co^paryson to gloss yt sat next
Moralizaco^n with a cloak contexte
Sat and scripture was scribe to them all
He sat ay writing of yt that should fall
These were those that I there knew
By no manner way of old acqueyntau^ce
But as I before saw them with vertewe
Company in field and having dalyaunce
And as I thus stood half in a trance
While they were occupied in there business
Abowte the walls mine eyes began I dress
Where I beheld the marvelous story
That ever yet I saw in any pycture
For on tho walls was made memory
Syngulerly of every creature
That there had b^ both form and stature
Whose names reherce I woll as I can
Bring them to mind in order every man
First to begin there was in portrature
Adam and Eve holdyng an appyl round
No^ in a ship and Abraham having sure
A flyntstoon in his hand and Ysaac lay bou^d^
On an high mouu^t Jacob slepyng sound
And a long ladder stood him beside
Joseph in a cisterne was also there yt tide
Next whom stood Moses with his tables two
Aaron and Vrre his arms supportyng
Ely in a brennyng chare was there also
And Elize stood clad in an hermytes clothyng
David with an harp and a stoon slyng
Ysaye Jeremy and Ezechiell
And closyd with lions holy Danyell
Abacuc Michee with Malachy
And Jonas out of a whales body coming
Samuel in a temple and holy zachary
Beside an awter all blody stondyng
Ozee with Iudyth stood there conspyryng
The death of Oloferne and Solomon also
A child with his sword dyuydyng in two
Many mo prophets certeynly there were
Whose names now come not to my mind
Melchisedech also aspyed I there
Bread and wine offrynge as fell to his kind
Ioachym and Anna stood all behind
Embracyd in armies to the golden gate
And holy John Baptist in a desert sat
And now comyth to my remembrance
I am auysed I saw Sodechy
And Amos also with sobre countenance
Stondyng with her faces toward Sophony*
Neemye and Esdras bare them company
The holy man Job as an Impotent
Then followed in pycture with Thoby pacyent
These with many mo on yt one side
Of yt grene herber portrayed were
A said Morpleus a little time abide
Turn thy face where thy back was ere
And behold well what thou see there
Then I me tornyd as he me badde
With heart steadfast and countenance sadd
Where I saw Peter with his keys stand
Poul with a sword James also
With a scalop and Thomas holdyng in his hand
A spear and Philyp aproched him to
Ia^^^s the less next them in pycture ^o
Stood with Barehilmew which was all flayn
Simon and Thadee showed hou they were slain
Mathy and Barnabe drawyng lottys stood
Next whom was mark a lion him by
His book holdyng and Matthew in his mode
Resemblyd an angel with wings gloryously
Luke had a calfe to hold his book on hy
And John with a cup and palm in his hand
An egle bare his book thus saw I hem stand
Gregori and Jerome austyn and Ambrose
With pilyon^ on there hedes stood like doctors
Bernarde with Ancelme and as I suppose
Thomas of Alquine and Dominik confessors
Benet and Hew religyous governors
Martyne and John with bishop tweyne
Were there also and Crisostome certain
Behind all these was worshypfull Bid
All behind and next him stood Origene
Hydyng his face as he of his deed
Had them ashamed ye wot what I mean
For of errrour was he not all clean
And on that side stood there last of all
The noble prophetissa Sybyll men her call
Let me remember now I you pray
My brain is so thynne I deem in my heart
^^^e of the felyshyp* y^ I there say
In all this while have Iouerstert
A benedicite none ere cowde I aduert
To thy^ke on Andrew the apostle with his cross
Whom to forget^ were a great loss
Many one moo were peynted on yt wall
Whose names now come not to remembrance
But these I markyd in especyall
And moo cowde I tell in contynuau^ce
Of time but for to show you the substance
Of this matere in the mids of yt herbere
Sat doctrine colored as any cristall cl^re
Crowned as I told you late here before
Who^s apparayll was worth tresour Infynyt
All erthly richesse count I no more
To y in co^paryson valewyng than a myt
Over her heed houed a culuer fair and whyt
Out of whose bylle proceeded a great le^^e
Dou^warde to doctrine like a son beme
The words of doctrine ya^e great redo^^nce
In swetnes of savor to her discyples all
It far exceded myrre and franke^sence
Or any other tree spyce or else gall
and when she me aspyed anon she began me call
and commanded morpleus yt he should bring me nere
For she would me show theffect of my desire
She said I know the cause of thy coming
Is to vndstonde by mine enformaco^n
Sensibly the matere of morpleus showing
As he has the led abowte in vysyon
Wherefore now I apply thy natural reason
Unto my words and er thou hens wend
Thou shall it know beginning and end
First where Colus to pluto was brought
By his own neclygence taken prysonere
Within the ^rthe for he to ^erre sought
Sygnyfied is no more by that matere
But oonly to show the how it does ap^^^
That wealth vnbrydelyd dayl^ at thyn ^y
Encressyth mysrule and often causyth folly
For like as Colus being at his large
Streyted hy^self ^hrugh his own lewdenesse
For he would deal where he had no charge
Right so wantons by there wyldnesse
Often time bring themself in distress
By cause they sometime to largely d^^l^
What may wors be suffered tha^ ouermoch well
By mynos the Judge of hell desperate
May be vndstonde goddis ryghtwysnes
That to every wight his pain deputate
Assygneth according to his wyckydnes
Wherefore he is called Judge of cruelnes
And as for dyana and neptunus compleynt
Fygured may be fools reason feynt
For like as they made there suggestyo^
To have me colus from course of his kind
Which was impossyble to bring to co^^^^^o^n
For evermore his lyberte have woll the wind
In like wise foles other while be blind
Wenyng to subdew with there own hand
That is ouermoche for an hoole land
But what folowyth thereof yt shall you here
When they were come to the bankete
The great appollo with his sad chere
So fair and curteysly began them entrete
That he made there berdes on the new get
Loo what wisdom does to a fool
Wherefore are children put to scole
Often is it seen with sobre countenance
That wysemen fools overcome ay
Tomyng as them list and all there varyaunce
Change from ernest in to merry play
What were they both amended that day
When they were driven to there wits end
Were they not fey^e to grant to be his friend
Right so fools when they have done
All that they can then be they feign
Give up there matter to oblyuyone
Without reward they have no more brain
And yet full often has it be sayn
When they it have foryete and set at naught
yt they full dear have afterward it bought
And as for all tho that represent
To he called goddys at that bank^^
Resemble false ydollys but to this intent
Was morpleus commanded thither the to fet
That you sholdest know the manner and the get
Of the paynym law and of their believe
How false ydolatry ledyth them by the sleue
For soon upon the worldis creaco^n
When adam and eve had broke the precept
Which clerks call the time of deuyaco^n
The worldly people in paynym law slept
Till moses vnd god the tables of stoon kept
In which time poets feyned many a fable
To dyscrete reason right acceptable
And to the intent that they should sound
To the eres of them the more pleasantly
yt them should read or here they yaue them a groude
And added names unto them naturally
Of whom they spoke and called them goddys hy
Some for y^ strength and myt of there nature
And some for there subtle wytty conjecture
By nature thus as the seven planettes
Have there propre names by astronomers
But goddys were they called by old poets
For there great veruency of werhy^g in there speres
Experyence preuyth this at al years
And for as other that goddys called be
For subtle wit that shall I teache the
How they by that hye name of god came
In this said time the people was so rude
That what manner creature man or woman
Loud any nouelte contryne and conclude
For the common well all the multytu^e
Of the common people a god should him call
Or a goddess after it was fall
Of the same thing that was so new found
As Ceres for she the craft of tylth fond
Whereby more plenteuouly corn did habou^de
The people her called through out every land
Goddess of corn wenyng in her hand
Had layn all power of corns habu^daunce
Thus were y^ paynems dysceyued by ygnorau^ce
In like manner Isys was called the goddess
Of fruit for she first made it multiply
By the name of graffyng and so by process
The name of pan began to deyfy
For he first found the mean sheep to guy
Some took it also by there condyco^n
As pluto fortune and such other done
Thus all yt poets put under couerture
Of fable the rural people it took
Properly as act refusyng the figure
Which error some of them never forsook
Often a falls myrrour diceyueth a mannys look
As thou may daily preue at thine ey
Thus were the paynyms disceyued generally
That seenge the deedly enmy of mankind
By his power permyssyue entered the images
Wtin the temples to make the people blind
In there ydolatry stondyng on high stages
In so much who vsyd dauugerous passages
Any manner way by water or by land
When did his sacryfice his ansuere ready fond
Thus during the time of deuyaco^n
From Adam to Moses was ydolatry
Thrngh the world vsyd in common opinion
These were the goddys yt thou there sy
And as for the auayters yt stood them by
They polytyk philosophers and poets were
Which feyned the fables yt I speak of here
Then sessyd the time of deuyaco^n
When Moses received the tables of stone
Entryng the time of reuocaco^n
O^ the mount of synay stondynge alone
God gave him might again all his fone
And then began the old testament
Which to the people by Moses was sent
And that time dured to the Incarnaco^n
Of Crist and then began it to sesse
For then came the time of reconsylyaco^n
Of man to god I tell the doutlesse
When the sone of man put him in press
Wylfully to suffer death for mankind
In holy scripture this may thou find
This reconsylyaco^n was the time of grace
When found was yt church upon y^ fair stone
And to holy Peter the keye delyuerd was
Of heaven then hell dyspolled was anon
Thus was makyude delyuerde from his fone
And then began the new testament
That the christian people believe in present
Which three times asondry dyuyded
May thou here se if thou list behold
The first hehynde the in pycture in provided
The second of y^ lift hand show prophet old
The. iij. on y^ right hand her it is to y^ told
Thus have you in vysyon the very figure
Of thise. iij. times here showed in portrayture
That is to say first of deuyaco^n
From Adam to Moses recordyng scripture
Second fro Moses to the Incarnaco^n
Of Crist kepyth reuocacyons cure
And as for the third you may be very sure
Will dure from thens till the worlds end
But now the. iiij. must you have in mind
Which is called properly y^ time of pylgrimage
After some and some name it otherwise
And call it the time of dangerous passage
And sometime of werre yt fully it dispyse
But what so it be named I woll the auyse
Remember it well and prynte it in thy mind
Whereof the figure may you me behind
And else remember thyself in thine heart
How vice and virtue daily them occupy
In manner one of them him to peruerte
Another to bring him to endless glory
Thus they continue fight for the vyctory
It is no need hereof to tell the more
For in this short visyo^ you have seen it before
And as for attropos grievous compleynt
Unto the goddys betokenyth no more
But oonly to show y^ how friendly constreynt
On a steadfast heart weyeth full sore
Good will requires good will again therefore
Dyscorde to death has ay be^ a friend
For dyscorde brings many to there end
Wherefore death thought he would avenged be
On his friends quarrel if that he might
For her great unkindness in somoche as she
Was among them all had so in despyte
And at banquet made of so lyte
Which caused hy^ among the^ to cast in a bone
^ found them gnawyng enough enerychone
Thus often is seen oo friend for a another
Will say and do and sometime matters feyne
And also kynnesmen a cosyne or a brother
Will for his aly er he have cause complain
And where yt he louyth do his besy pain
His friends matter as his own to take
Which often causith much sorrow awake
Be it right or wrong he chargyth not a myte
As toward yt point he takyth little head
So yt he may have his froward appetyte
Performed he cares not how his soul speed
Of god or devil have such little dread
How be it one there is that lord is of all
Which to every wight at last reward shall
and as for the battle between vice and virtue hold
So plainly apperyth to the Inwardly
To make exposyco^n thereof new or old
Were but superfluyte therefore refuse it I
In man shall thon find yt werre kept daily
Like as you have seen it fowtin before thy face
y^ pycture me behind shewyth it in lytyl space
And for macrocosme it is no more to say
But the less world to the common intent
Which applied is to man both night and day
So is man the field to which all were sent
On both parties and they yt thither went
Sygnyfy no more but after the condyco^n
Of every man's opinion
And as for the noble knight ^erseueraunce
Which gate y^ field when it was almost gone
Betokenyth no more but the contynuaunce
Of virtuous living till death has ouergone
Who so woll do rewarden is anon
As virtue was with the crown on hy
Which is no more but everlasting glory
And as for prestience and predestinaco^n
That each of them rewarded after his desert
Is to vndstonde no more but dampnaco^n
To vycyous people is the very scourge smert
Reward for they fro virtue would pervert
And endless Joy is to them yt ben elect
Rewarded and to all yt follow the same sect
And as for the keys of the posternes five
Which were to morpleus reward for his labor
Sygnyfye not else but while man is on live
His five inward wits shall be every hour
In his sleep occupied in hele and in langour
With fantasyes trifles Illusyons and dremes
Which poets call morpleus stremes
And as for residynacon is no more to say
But after confession tornyng aye^ to sin
Which to every man retorneth sauns delay
To vycyous living again him to win
While any man lives woll it never blynne
That cursyd conclusyon for to bring about
But reason with sadness keep it still out
Here have thou properly the very sentence
Herd now declared of this vysyon
The pycture also yeueth clear Intellygence
Thereof behold with good dyscresyon
Look well abowte and take consyderasyon
As I have declared whether it so be
A sir quoth morpleus what told I the
Have thou not thine hertes desire
Look on you wall yonder before
And all that time stood I in a wyre
Which way first mine heart would give more
To look in a stody stood I therefore
Netherlesse at last as morpleus me badde
I lokyd forward with contenaunce sad
Where I beheld in portrature
The manner of the field even as it was
Showed me before and every creature
On both sides being drawn in small space
So curyously in so little a compace
In all this world was never thing wrought
It were impossyble in earth to bethought
And when I had long beheld yt pycture
What quoth morpleus how longshalt you look
Daryng as a dastarde on you portrayture
Come of for shame thy wit stant a croke
I heryng that mine heart to me took
Toward y^ fourth wall tornyng my vysage
Where I saw poets and philosophers sage
Many one moo than at the banquet
Served the gods as I said before
Some were made stondyng and some in charys set
Some lokyng on bokis as they had stndyed sot
Some drawyng almenakis and in there ho^des bot
Astyrlabes taking the altitude of the son
Among whom dyogenes sat in a tonne
And as I was lokynge on that fourth wa^ll
Of dyogenes beholding the image
Suddenly doctrine began me to call
And bad me torn toward her my vysage
And so then I did with humble courage
What thy^kest you she said have you not thentent
Yet of these four walls what they represent
The picture on the first yt stondith at my bak
Shewyth y^ present time of pilgrimage
Of which before I unto the spak
Why^he is the time of dangerous passage
The second discretly again my vysage
The time expreslyth of deuyaco^n
While paynyme law had che domynaco^n
The third wall stondyng on my lift hond
The time representyth of reuocaco^n
And the fourth stondyng on my right hand
Determyneth the time of recousylyaco^n
This is the effect of thy vysyon
Wherefore the needs no more thereon to muse
It were but vein thy wits to dysuse
But during the time of reconsylyaco^n
Thy time of pilgrimage look well y^ spend
And then well gracyous predestynaco^n
Bring the to glory at thy last end
And even with yt came to my mind
My first conclusyon that I was about
To have dreuen er sleep made me to loute
That is to say how sensualyte
With reason to acorde might be brought about
Which caused me to knele down on my kne
And bescke doctrine determyne yt doubt
O lord god said doctryn^ can y^ not without
Me that conclusyon bring to an end
Far is fro the wit and ferther good mende
And even with yt death began appear
Showing himself as though yt he would
His dart have ocupyed within y^ herbere
But there was none for him young nor old
Save oonly I doctrine him told
And when I herd her with him common thus
I me wythdrewe behind morpleus
Dredyng full sore leest he with his dart
Through doctrynes words any entresse
In me would have had or claymed any pa^rt
Which should have causid me great heaviness
Within which time and short process
Came thither reason and sensualyte
A quod doctrine right welcome be ye
It is not long sith we of you spoke
Ye muster you goo determyne a doubt
And even with that she the matter brake
To them and told it every where about
I would have be thens if I had moute
For fere I lokyd as black as a cole
I would have cropen in a mous hole
What quod doctrine where is he now
That meuyd this matere strange and dyffuse
He is a cowarde I make mine auow
He hydeth his heed his moco^n to refuse
Blame hy^ not quoth reason always yt to use
When he sees death so nere at his hand
It is his part him to wythstonde
Or at the leest way else fro him flee
As long as he may who does otherwise
Is an Ideote quod sensualytee
Who dredyth not death wise men him dispyse
What said doctrine how long has this gy^e
Behold and used thus atwyxe you tweyne
Ye were not wont to acorde certain
Yes quod reason in this point always
To every man have we give our counsayll
Death for to flee as long as they may
All thouh we otherwise have don our (...)
Each other to repress yet wythouce fayll
In that point oonly dyscorded we ^euer
Thus condescended therein be we for ever
Aha said doctrine then is the conclusyon
Clearly determined of the great doubt
That here was menyd and half in der^^^^n
She me then called and bad me look out
Come forth she said and fere not this route
And even with yt reason and sensualyte
And death fro thens were vanysshed all three
Then looked I forth as doctrine me bad
When death was gone me thought I was bold
To show myself but yet I was sad
Me thought my doubt was not as I would
Clearly and openly declared and told
It sowned to me as a parable
Derke as a myste or a feyned fable
And doctrine my conceyte began espy
Wherefore said she stondest thou so still
Wherein is thy thought art thou in study
Of thy question have thou not thy fill
To the declared tell me thy will
Herdest thou not reason and sensualyte
Declared thy dought here before the
Forsothe quod I I herd what they said
But nevertheless my wit is so thynne
And allo of death I was so afraid
That it is out where it went inn
And so y^ matere can I not win
Without your help and benyuolence
Thereof so express the very sentence
Well quoth doctrine then give attendaunce
Unto my words and thou shall here
Openly declared the concordaunce
A^wene sensualyte and reason in fere
If y^ take bid it clearly does appear
How they were knytte in one openyon,
Both ay^nst death held contradicco^n
Why^^^ concordaunce no more signyfieth
To plain understanding but in every mane
Both s^usualyte and reason applies
Rather death to flee than with it to be taken
Loo in ye point accord they holy thane
And in all other they clearly dyscorde
Thus is sruly set thy doutfull monarcorde
I heryng that knelyd on my kne
And thanked her lowely for her discyplyne
That she vouchesauf of her benygnyte
Of tho great doubts me to enlumyne
Well was she worthy to be called doctrine
If it had be no more but for the solusyon
Of my demand and of this strange vysyon
And as I (...) mine head began for to bow
As me well ought to do her reverence
She thens departed I can not tell how
But within a moment gone was she thens
Then said morpleus let us go hens
What should we here tarry lengere
Have you not herd a general answer
To all thy materes that you list to meue
My time drawyth nere that I must rest
And even therwyth he took me by the sleue
And said goo we hens for yt hold I best
As good is enough as a great fest
Thou have seen enough hold the conten
And even with that forth with him I went
Till he had me brought again to my bed
Where he me found and then pryuely
He stale away I cowde not understand
Where he became but suddenly
As he came he went I tell you verily
Which done fro sleep I began to awake
My body all in swet began for to shake
For dread of the sight that I had seen
Wenyng to me all had be true
Actuelly done where I had been
That battle hold twene vice and vertew
But when I se it was but a whew
A dreme a fantasy and a thing of naught
To study thereon I had no more thought
Till at the last I began me bethynke
For what cause showed was this visyon
I knew not wherefore I took pen and ynke
And paper thereof to make mencyon
In writing taking consyderacyon
That no defawte were found in me
Whereon accused I ought for to be
For sloth yt I had left it untold
Neither by mouth nor in remembrance
Put it in writing where through many fold
Ways of accusaco^n mit torn^ me to greuau^ce
All this I saw as I lay in a trau^ce
But whether it was with mine ey bodily
Or not in certain god knowyth and not I
That to dyscerne I purpose not to dele
So large by my will it longyth not to me
Were it dreme or visyon for your own well
All that shall it read here it rad or se
Take thereof the best and let the worst be
Try out the corn clean from the chaff
And then may ye say ye have a sure staff
To stand by at need if ye woll it hold
And walk by the way of virtues lore
But always beware be ye young or old
That your frewyll ay to virtue more
Apply than to vice the casyer may be bore
The burden of the field that ye daily fight
Against your. iij. enmyes for all there great might
That is to say the devil and the flesh
And also the world with his glosyng chere
Which on you lokyth ever new and fresshe
But he is not as he does appear
Look ye keep you ay out of his daungere
And so the vyctory shall ye obtain
Vice fro you exyled and virtue in you reyne
And then shall ye have ye tryu^phall guerdon
That god reserueth to every creature
Above in his celestyall mansyon
Joy and bliss Infynyte eternally to endure
Whereof we say we would feyne be sure
But the way thidwarde to hold be we loathe
yt often sithe causes ye good lord to be wroth
And by our deserte our babytaco^n chau^geth
Fro Joy to pain and woo perpetuelly
From his glorious sight thus he us estrau^geth
For our vicyous lyuyug through our own folly
Wherefore let us pray to that lord of glory
While we in earth be yt he woll give us grace
So us here to guide yt we may have a place
According to our regeneracyo^n
With heavenly spyrytes his name to magnyfy
Which down descended for our redempcyon
Offryng hy^self on the cross to his fad on hy
Now benygne Ihesu yt borne was of Mary
All yt to this visyon have given there audyence
Grant eternal Joy after thy last sentence
AMEN Thus ends this little moralized treatise compiled by dan John Lydgat
sometime monk of Bury / on whose soul god have mercy.
