CORDA ANGLIAE: OR, THE GENERAL EXPRESSIONS OF THE LAND: Moving XXV.
Particulars to the Honorable Assembly in the High Court of Parliament.

THAT THE CHVRCH of England may become a glorious Church of GOD.

Printed in the year 1641.

To the High and Honorable Assembly in the upper and lower House of Parliament.
Most noble Senators:
WHereas many petitions are daily presented before your Honors, some in the
behalf of their friends, others also for themselves, and all for succor and
relief; their causes are heard in your honorable Assembly, treated on, and
according to the truth of the cause so is it releeved. Amongst the rest, may it
please your high and honorable Court to deem a favorable eye on my petition
also, put up, not in the behalf of my own particular, nor of one or two
friends alone, but in the behalf of the whole Church: and whatsoever in it
your honorable Assembly conceives not fit to grant, let it be abortive.
Vouchsafe it, most noble Senators, but an eye in her behalf, and as your
Honors find that she has been abused, so releeve her. But because from the
highest Cedars to the lowest Lilie in the Church of Christ, all are confident
in your proceedings, rejoicing in your high and honorable Assembly, before
whom I tender my cause, and with the whole Church depend on God and you for a
trial: till when, we pray for heavenly wisdom to direct you; and now, and
then, and ever, the grace, peace, love, and comfort of the Trinity to abide
with you.

Your poor petitioner in the behalf of a distressed Church, Hen: Walker:

THat the glory of the LORD may shine forth, and be expressed in that fullness
which he is pleased to discover among us, that the talent of the Lord in our
Churches may everywhere be expressed according to that measure of ability which
the Lord vouchsafes us.

II.
That the Kings Majesty may have a clear, quiet, peaceable, and happy
government, over a glorious Church, and a flourishing Kingdom. And that such
good order be taken herein, that all conspirators and treacherous persons
whatsoever, whether open or secret, foreign or domesticke, against his Royal
Majesty, or against our noble Queen, Prince, or any the Progeny of that Royal
stem, or against the Church, or State, etc. that such evil persons so
affected, be in no wise suffered and passed by, but be utterly rooted out and
expelled. And that his Majesty may have all the honor, and humble obedience
from his Subjects, as is meet to so excellent and worthy a King.

Church and State, so did they enjoy happy governments in both.

III.
That the government of the Church be no more wholly left to Bishops impious
government, to bring such scandal as it has done to Religion; but that there
may be lay Elders, according to the Primitive Churches; or some other
government under the Kings Majesty (as the Honorable Assembly shall think
meet) to assist the Clergy in Ecclesiastical matters, that so the Clergy be
not taken off from their Pulpits, as they have been, to the great misery of
many Congregations under them. And that all Pastors may therefore hereafter
perform their office of preaching, as they ought to do, to the peoples
edification, and comfort, feeding the flock of Christ.

IV.
That the Bishops be henceforth preaching Ministers, and not any more lifted
up to such lordly hierarchy as they have been heretofore: that they may be
wholly taken off from temporal matters, and reduced only to the ministry of
the Word, the Sacraments, and Prayer, and such like offices of the ministerial
function, as are warrantable, and according to the word of God.

V.
That every Congregation in the kingdom of England may be furnished with an
Orthodox preaching Minister, that may preach constantly and truly, the Doctrine
of the Lord Jesus Christ: and that moreover no Minister have the charge of more
then one Parish under him; and that no Congregation may be compelled to
entertain an unable or ungodly Minister against their wills; and that no
Pastor being set over any Congregation, be suffered to live idly, but may be
compelled to express his pains in the ministry constantly, as a faithful
Pastor of Jesus Christ*

Hierom says in his 84. Epistle to Eustochius, that there are some proud
Priests, who are made Deacons and Ministers for no other end, but that they may
have liberty to show themselves pleasant before women: and such men's care is
all upon their apparel, that it may be trim, and sweet, that their shoes sit
spruce to their feet, that the hairs of their head be finely wrinckled, and
curled, and that their fingers may glister with gold rings. Such men (says the
Father) when you see them, you may rather judge them bridegroomes, or wooers,
then Priests, or men of the Clergy.

VI.
That no Minister whatsoever, may be suffered to teach or preach any doctrine
grounded only upon the bare opinions of men, except he can also prove it so to
be apparently evident by the word of God. And that neither the Minister nor
people may be oppressed with the observance of such traditions of men, which
are repugnant to the word of God.

VII.
That there be no such disorderly and interrupted kind of praying, as is used
in the Church Liturgy, but that the Pastor or Minister only pray aloud in a
decent and orderly manner to the peoples capacity, as the mouth of the
Congregation, not being interrupted, the people silently joining with him, that
so they may pray in spirit and in truth together, and that thereby their
affections may be the more elevated, assenting thereto with the word Amen, or
the like expression, without disturbance, as the custom is, when the Minister
prays one thing, the people they interrupt him, and pray for something else,
who should rather give their assent to that which the Pastor or Minister
prays for, with Amen, or the like expression.

VIII.
That the Ministers of Christ may not be compelled to supertitious bowings, or
to wearing of the Surplesse, Tippet, etc. or to observe any other superstitious
ceremony, which Jesus Christ never imposed upon them. And that there be no
Courts allowed to have power to bind men's consciences to the observance of
such things as are not only not manifest in Gods word, but contrary to the
same, which has been a great burden to the Church of God.

Prelates which are so in love with Ceremonies, may think upon that story of
the Devil, in Josephus, who came amongst the Bishops with his fine sleeves,
rochet, and every thing as complete as any amongst them, to the wonder and
astonishment of the beholders.

IX.
That the faithful and painful Ministers of the word of God may be
reverently respected, and that the people do diligently hear and attend them,
and be not suffered in any wise to scandalize them, nor have power to depose
them, or put them out, whom before they made choice of by a free consent,
except upon just cause, and such proof as shall apparently manifest that they
are such as ought to be deprived by the word of God, but otherwise to respect
them as such who have the charge, and are the overseers of their souls.

X.
That the oath ex officio be so overthrown that it may never rise again to
exact, as it has done, in the Prelates Courts, extorting upon men's concealed
thoughts, molesting innocent causes, by secret suggestions: and that all Courts
shall henceforth proceed against only such crimes as are evident to be sins by
the word of God, and made manifest either by the confession of the party
himself without an oath, or the witness of honest and sufficient testimony by
an oath: And that every person accused, shall be heard without partiality, or
injustice, to speak freely what he can for himself, in any matter or cause,
whatsoever shall be objected against him.

etc.

XI.
That no Ecclesiastical officer may proceed to penance, or excommunicate any
offender for his crime, after he shall freely acknowledge the same, by
professing hearty repentance if the crime be private, or a public
acknowledgement and confession, with protestation of penitency, if the offense
be notorious, it being the office of the civil Magistrate to do the rest.
Yet if such offenders be obstinate, and will not be persuaded to penitency, he
who shall so continue an heretic, may be excommunicated, yet not without the
consent of the whole Congregation, in the public assembly, and then to leave
them to God, and the further punishment of the civil Magistrate: yet to labor
in the tender bowels of mercy, to bring them into the Church again by
repentance, and not to suffer (if it be possible) the weak brethren to perish.

XII.
That all Ecclesiastical officers, of what order or degree soever they be in
the Church, may be liable to the punishment of temporal Magistrates, as well
as the lay people, and that not only for whoredom, drunkenness, swearing, and
the like crimes, but that it may be lawful also for the temporal Magistrate
to punish them for abuses in their Ecclesiastical offices.

the Council of Towers, does exhibit all Consistories and Judgment seats, and
secular matters, not only out of the Church, but so far commits them to the
civil Magistrate, that they suffered them not in the very porch of the Church.

XIII.
That no part of the Apocrypha be appointed to be read in the Church Liturgy,
as it uses to be, notwithstanding many chapters in the canonical Scriptures
which are never read: that therefore only the Canonical Scriptures may be
read in Churches. And moreover that it be so ordered, that the whole Canonical
Scriptures may be appointed to be read through once every year, if not
expounded also.

XIV.
That the people may not be constrained in the Sacrament to any particular
gesture, That the people may not be constrained in the Sacrament to any
particular gesture, or outward Ceremony, nor meet with such disturbance as some
have done at that very time, about outward superstition, and vain trifles.
That all such who being in the Church, come to the Sacrament prepared, may be
admitted without disturbance. And that the Ministers may be restrained from
that vain adoration of the Sacrament, by bowing, which many use, to the great
dishonor of Almighty God, making an idol of the bread and wine, given to us
for a sacrament ordained by Christ, not to be adored as a God, or idol, but
used as a sacrament. And that the Communion Table may never any more be
altered, or called an altar, or set up otherwise, but stand as a Table in the
Church, according to Christ's institution. And that the Cross in Baptism be no
more tied to the Church, nor any such like Popish Ceremonies or circumstances,
as the child promising and answering in the godfathers and godmothers, in it
self as it were, as if the Ghost of the child had at that time being in them.
That all such popish rites and superstitions may be reformed*

says he, on Easter day, this day Christ rose from death, death, whereas we
know that it was many hundred years since that he arose from death, yet we
do not herein speak lies when we so speak, because every one knows that we
call the day so, by a similitude to the day wherein the thing was done, which
by the course of the year is a like day: so we say such things were done this
day, or that day, for the celebration of the Sacraments, when as we know both
the day and the thing it self was long since. Was Christ offered any more but
once, and he offered himself, so that the outward things in the Sacrament are
not very Christ, but the sacrament or similitude of his death, etc.

XV.
That all Crucifixes, Candles, Tapers, and Images be removed out of our
Churches, and all Idolatry, and such like vain worship, that so the Church of
England may become so glorious a Church, when she shall be void of all Popish
shadows and ceremonies, using no other expressions or jestures of the body,
save only such whereby the body expresses that which is in the mind.

Psalm. 115.4. Isay* 42.8. 1 Cor. 5.11. 2 Cor. 6.6. It is lamentable to consider
the lying fables and tales which the Jesuits make the simple people believe of
Crucifixes, and Candles, etc. amongst the rest, how abominable is that fable
which they declare and tell the people, of a wicked fellow who never did any
good deeed in all his life, save only once he offered a Candle to the Virgin
Mary, for which, as their lying fable says, when he was in hell afterward,
he cried to the Virgin Mary to help him, and she hearing of him, returned him
his Candle again, with the which he fought with the Devils, and drove them all
away, and rid himself of them. etc.

XVI.
That such who are studious in Divinity, and have not received (as yet) the
orders of the Ministry, (holding no heresy, nor schismatic doctrine, but
such as is sound and orthodox, and have a good report) may be suffered to
preach before a Congregation, for the trial and exercise of their abilities,
to the great satisfaction and proof on either part: albeit they exercise or
meddle not with any other part of action of the ministerial function, save
only praying and preaching, until such time they shall be received into
orders.

would be a means to keep many unable Scholars (who are very unfit for the
Ministry) out, that such as be received into orders, may be known to be
able to divide the Word aright.

XVII.
That every allowed Pastor and Minister of Gods word may have sufficient
maintenance settled upon them, in such a form as none can deprive them of it,
neither in part, nor in whole, or at any time force them to sue for it, and so
be interrupted from their studies and Pulpits to follow the Law, but that they
may have it so settled upon them, that they may receive it without trouble; and
that all such of them who dying shall leave behind them wife or children of
honest and good report, may (in case they should want) be provided for.

XVIII.
That none be admitted into the order of the Ministry, but only such who are
able to preach and expound the Scriptures, whereby they may discharge the
office of a Minister, to the careful overseeing and feeding of the flock.

that will be a Minister (says Haymo on Timoth* 5. chapter) must have three
things in him: First, that he be of a good Religion: Secondly, that he be of a
good life and conversation: Thirdly, that he be able to exhort with wholesome
doctrine, and to reprove the gainsayers thereof.

XIX.
That some course be taken for the poor, other then that has been, whereby in
many places and parishes the Churchwardens have by sacrilege spent that upon
themselves, which did belong to the poor of the Church, and converted it to
great benefit for themselves, whilst the poor have had very little of it, or
benefit by it; they have made themselves richer, by making the Church-treasury
poorer. That therefore order may be taken, that they may often render an
account what they have received, and how such treasure is disposed on in every
particular.

canon of the Council of Rhemes is utterly against those deceitful withdrawing
and converting of the Church treasury to their own benefit.

XX.
That no water-man may row on the Sabbath day, as many do make a practice of
it, no Carrier travel on that day, no Tavern or Alehouse may entertain any
company on that day, to drink or revell, but only such strangers and
travelers as they have entertained, and to them only as diet and lodging, not
to drink and carouse, nor receive any company who come of purpose for jollity,
drinking-matches, merriment, and the like, whereby the holy Sabbath has been
much polluted: That no Applemonger, Chandler, Barber, Semster, Shoemaker,
Tailor, or any other trade or occupation whatsoever, may be admitted to trade,
or to have any employment in or about their vocation on the Sabbath day, save
only such offices who belong to the Church, to the poor, to the sick, or the
like, which for piety ought not, or for charity could not be done before, or
after the Sabbath, to prevent the doing of it then: but that no sports or
pastimes, no common trading for unconstrained uses, nor Courts of judicature,
nor any unnecessitated temporal employments and practices, be permitted, or
suffered on that day to be done, nor in any part or hour thereof, neither
before, in, or after the time of the general duties in the assembly of the
Church.

permits neither markets, justice Courts, nor trading, nor laboring on the
Sabbath day, as it is in the 16. article of the said Council. Infinite are
those examples which might be alleged of Gods judgments which have fallen
upon families, Towns, Cities, and whole Kingdoms, for neglect herein, as is
manifest in the Theater of Gods judgments, the Practice of Piety, Eusebius,
with diverse Chronicles, and Books besides.

XXI.
That what company or assembly soever are tolerated in the Kingdom, yet that
all his Majesty's subjects in the Kingdom, who are able, and may, do come to
the assembly and congregation in the Church on the Sabbath day, both morning
and evening, and there join with the assembly during all the time of the
exercises of the Church, that so the whole congregation may all partake of
those glorious ordinances which shall be used in the Church, to the glory of
God, and the comfort of their own souls.

That Popery, and all the relics thereof may be utterly rooted out of our
Churches, and pure Religion settled and established.

says in his second Sermon before King Edward, (speaking how the Romish Bishop
stood out so stiffely to bring in Popery, and settle it ^n the Church of
England) the Bishop of Rome (says he) sent him a Cardinals hat for his
labor, but (says he) he should have had a Tiburne tippet, a halfepeny
halter, and all such proud Prelates. These Romish trumpery (says he) never
brought good into England.

XXIII.
That all Popish books, heretical, and schismatic books, all unjust and
scandalous pamphlets, which by due examination are found so to be; all vain
and ungodly books, ballads, love-songs, and lascivious books, and vain
pamphlets, may be called in, and no more such may be ever tolerated hereafter,
or dispersed either in print, or in manuscript; which vain books, ballads,
and pamphlets, have taken deeper impression upon the hearts of many thousands,
to draw them to love and delight in those actions of sin, into which they have
been seduced by reading of them.

Cor. 11.28. Menander was a man so delighted with wanton books, that he writ
himself 80. books of love, and in the end grew outrageous in the love of
women.

XXIV.
That the revenues of Cathedralls be employed to better purposes, and not
wasted upon pipers, dancing-masters, drunken and deboist fellows, and such as
are no way beneficial or advantageous to the Church of Christ, to the State,
nor to the bodies or souls of any members of the Church or State; but that it
may be employed on such, and in such a manner, whereby the Church of God may
be bettered thereby.

Council of Towers the 11. canon, and 16. canon. Council of Trent page 574. 1 Timothy 3.5. 3 John 6. Act. 14.37. 2 Cor. 11.28. Is it not a miserable thing that
such men who are very ignorant in the Scriptures, and in the worship of God,
whose whole life is spent in idle songs, in tavernes, and wanton company, who
understand very little or no divinity at all, who are neither able to preach
nor to expound the Scriptures, shall be entertained into the Church, whilst
honest and sound Ministers are in want.

XXV.
That in all things all care possible may be taken, that the Church of England
may become a glorious Church.
