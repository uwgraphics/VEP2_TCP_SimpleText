THE SCOUT OF COCKENY.
NEptune being puffed up with the flatterers of the Greek and Latin Scriblers
that skirts the Hadriatick and Mediterian Sea, had the vanity to swagger in the
Ocean, and range about strange Coasts to increase the number of his Poetical
Parasits, so with his Fish Knight Errantry, he rushed through the Straits, and
turned his snout toward the North, where in half a days swiming he reached
the Coast of Portugal, without any mischance, except a slender crack in his
Lerbord Finn that he got as he passed by the Birling Islands; This did not at
all startle him from his Course to the Artick Pole, but most jocundly held on
till he came to the Bay of Biscay, where indeed his Godship was discovered to
be Mortal; for the billowing of these Waves set his watery Stomach a
tottering, and if there had not been a quack in the Navy that comforted him
with one of Buchursts Pectorall Loranges, he was fair to have gasped his last,
with great difficulty he rolled through that raging Gulffe, and no sooner came
into smoother Water, but he pricked up his Ears, streacht his Crist, brandished
his Triton with as dreadful and huffing an Aspect as the Alehouse Hectors
will toss notched Belboes in presence of their Country Kindred; in this
posture and rate he sneered away, seeeking for the mouth of the Channel, when
straight he was discovered by a Welsh Man of War, who no sooner came within
distance, but our bold British Gallyfoyst conceived by his snotty Beard, that
he was a Hollander come from Malago, drunk with Peettersemin, and to chastise
his intemperance, because it was not done with Metheglin, he immediately from
his Fore castle snuffed a cast of Culverins, which did so smite the aquatick
Monster upon the weather Jaw, that he was forced to turn his Tail to that
thundering Storm, and by a great Fa^t which was their appointed sign of
Retreat, he and the rest of his Briny Mirmidons run toward the Coast of
France, where it was the Fortune of his Vice Admiral, that was a Fiddler of
Flushing mounted on a Mar-maid to spend his Bowspreet upon the Cardinal
Islands, and if happly Monsiur de Fonquets Galleys of Bell-Isle had not come to
his rescue, the Phlegmatic Rodomontado had lost that Music which makes the
Burgamasters Annakies of Amsterdam yawn after Rope Dauncers.

From Sunny-side.
ONe of our Philosophers Wives according to the custom of the Coast-side
Gossips, last night skimmered away to Bourdeux to swill of the new Wine, upon
her return she touched at Goree where Opdam lies; she reports that at her being
there, one Doctor Abraham Kesse wrought a speedy Cure on Opdam, both as to his
Gout and Flux, the one he stopped with a new discovered Cheese made of Geese
Milk, the other he disolved with a Cataplasm composed of Fish Guts: But the
Physician had but a slender reward for not prolonging the Cure, there being now
no shift left to shelter his shamefastness at Sea: In the mean time, this
cloven Mercury has brought a shrewd jealousy upon her self, for making all
that Voyage in 24. hours, and it is without all peradventure to be expected the
first Oyster Boat that is cast away, but her Winding Sheet will be converted
into a Tar Barrel, else the world is much mistaken of the discretion of their
Justice of Peace.

From Lochquaber.
THere is a Norway Adventurer come here to Innerlochy loadened with Figs and
Frontiniack, and which is strange, of the Countries natural growth, and all
this is produced from the industry of their Accademicks; the place that yields
these Fruits is the valeys of Stravangle, and they say they cultivat the ground
with no other dung but that of Solin Geese, and Italian Becca Ficki, which by a
wonderful Artifice, a little mixed with a Charm they bring upon the place,
and very orderly each first Monday of the Month they squat according to their
Tribes in the parts appointed by the Surveyer of the Plantation.

From Tinto-tope.
THe Deputies appointed by the Mineral Committee of Virtuosi in this place are
returned from Braids Craigs, and Bennichi, they have found as much Gold in the
one as will make a Pick-tooth to the King of Fairy, and as much Silver in the
other as will make a Thimble to his Queen; they were very painful in their
sinking search, and they conclude by many pregnant symptoms that there is both
Gold and Silver, but before they can arrive at the right Vain, they must dig
within 13. Inches of the Antipods, which will scarcely be enterpized, unless
persons of public Spirits will advance money to defray the expense of
Materials.

Buck-haven.
ONe of our second rate Adventurers is safely arrived from the Straits, most
part of her Loadening is of the new sort of Hooks made of Venice Glass, except
some Furs for lynning our Aldermens Bulfangers. All the News that was
Current on the Realto at Venice, was a great report of a Water Combat twixt the
Bottle Beer Barge above London Bridge and the Bucentaure; If it be upon a
Shrove Tuesday about four in the evening, and the Thames bottom manned by
Prentises, and Governed by Dray-men, the Magnificoes and Pantolonies will be at
a damned loss, and they will sooner make Bowling-greens of the Dardanelloes
than gain any thing by that Bargain.

From Prestoun-Pans.
YOu have here an Extract of a Letter from our Oyster Consul at Zurex Sea, viz.
that after the HogginMoggin had sleept sufficiently after a plentiful
Carrouse, their prudentials led them to this Cautious result (that their Navy
till the Summer shall be disposed into several Harbors, but such places as are
in a capacity to Steel their white Livered souls with Aquafortis and
GunPouder, in order to which Rear Admiral Bublikins is come to this place, his
Squadron are as follows;

The Pontius Pilate of Amsterdam, the Simon Magus of Dort, the Soutterkin of
Skeulin, the Mareswin of Middelburgh, the Flunder of Flushing, the Cabaleu of
Camphire, the Haddock of Harlem, the Lobster of Leydan, the Goliath of Gorkum,
the Whale of Workum, the Buttered Eggs of Egmont, the Salt Eale of Enchusen,
the Punck of Putta, the Skaite of Skeedam, the Oyster of Oyster-Capell, the
Whyttin of Wester-Capell, the Mackerell of Mastensleuse, the Geck of Gorre, the
Grains of Brewers Haven, the Stock Fish of Halvert Sluice, the Bread and Cheese
of Beverweek, the Butter of Bonkes-slote, the Haire-groat of Horn, the Beens
and Bacon of Broad-wood.

A fire Ship called the Brandy of the Brill, two Pinks, the Elder and Younger
Cutts built of Rotterdam and Skarlaw; this is the true number of Bublikins
Fleet, his Historingrapher who is a redoubted Classick Poet in Holland, under
the name of Iacob-Vander-Hogge, gave the names to all this Spungy Gallantry,
for which he was rewarded with two Barrels of pickled Herring to entertain his
Wife who was a Castaway Bloom-berry Hackney; yet the Jade has turned so
fruitful there, that she frequently brings forth Litters of Souterkins. Its
much to be feared that the heat of an English Broadside will make this wretched
Generation of pickled Pilchers dissolve like Anchoves upon a Choffin-dish.

Killimure.
THe Provests Daughter of this place has been laboring this two years of a
most consuming Green-sicknesse, but now She is most miraculously cured by the
Pyper of Clovo; for with half a dozen of Bends of a drink stoured upon Straw,
he has restored Her both to Stomach and Complexion: This same Isntrumental
Virtuoso is largely as well known in the Mathematics, as in Medicine; for with
the Drone of his Pype, he makes greater discoveries in the Moon, then Sir
Sydrafall does with his Telescope: for those who tried it, says, they not only
discover Hills, Woods, and Rivers, but Towns and Castles, and those fortified
in the Modish manner, with Bastions Ravellings, half Moons, Counterscarps, and
Hornworks, and Steeples with Sun-Dials: Al Italiano in point of Physic, he
operateth much by Glisters without any other conveyance but his Towl.

THere is strayed out of Inch-keeth a Turkey Cock thirty Inches high with
Vervails of Purc-leen, bearing the Arms of Prester John; who ever brings
notice to John Purdie Oyster Dregger in Rotton-raw, shall have three skelps
with a Skait Rump till he skyt Dumplings like green Geese in May.

Signiors Mal Retiro.

If any person be so foolish as to think there is nothing contained in this
Gazet, or so serious, that there is something he may be mistaken in both;
however, if any can find out the right Key, our Worshipful Senate of Cockeney
does promise to recommend him as a qualified Wit, to be AEnigmatical Professor
in any of the new established Seminaries for strange Discoveries.
