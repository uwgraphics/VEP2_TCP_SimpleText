The Tune to the Devonshire Cant:
Or, an Answer to the PARLIAMENT Dissolved at Oxford.
-- Nonne vides ut nudum remigio latus.
Horat. Ode XIIII Lib. I
THE safety of the KING and's Royal Throne,
Depends on those 500 KINGS alone;
Those, under whom some say three Kingdoms groan.
The Commons no new Methods will assign,
Of choosing KINGS they know the Royal Line,
Was wont to be reputed as Divine.
Your Englishmen who understand who gave,
Their KING his Royal grandeur scorn to have,
His Majesty their General, their Slave.
As frantic and outrageous as were,
Their VOTES; they showed their Vigilence and care,
And naught like those could dissipate our fear.
They are Dissolved and with them all our hopes,
Prepare for Smithfeild fires for Racks and Ropes;
For that is the pleasing Exercise of POPES.
Now to create Intestine Broyls what need
Is there, of those experienced things take heed,
When'th States Blood's hot it is dangerous to bleed.
In all true Hearts it would a Love create,
To see the Supreme power dissipate,
All Pentioners, those Spungers of our State.
The Commons aims were but to regulate,
Things shufll'd out of place in Church and State,
Nor to cramp Justice but corroborate.
When they offend they justly feel the smart,
Imposed on them by some ambitious heart;
Who Is swellen envy breaks out like a Fart.
But here is the mischief, they espouse the Law,
Hate those who Subjects from Allogiance draw,
And of their Royal Master stand in awe.
We Have grounds to hope when next they meet they will bring,
Wise Councels, Grave Proposals, every thing,
Conducive to the Peace of People and KING.
If so, we'll sing adieu to PLOTS, in vain
Shall Rogues attempt to shake our Peace again,
And then great CHARLES most happily will reign.
