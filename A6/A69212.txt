A pleasant Ditty, of a Maidens Vow,
That feign would Marry, and yet knew not how.

To the tune of, O no, no, no, not yet.


THere was a lusty (...) ^ull Lad,
that loved a Country Less:
And many a sweet discourse they had,
as they alone did pass:
^his Young Man he was apt to woe,
and well himself could carry,
^he Maid was kind of ^^^ing mind,
but yet she would not marry.
This Young man's heart was set on fire,
and still he did invent,
How he might compass his desire,
and frustrate her intent:
For still this Maid said as before,
from all thy hopes I Will bar thee:
Therefore be gone, let me alone,
in sooth I will not marry.
This answer much dismayed him,
and troubled so his mind,
that he thereat looked pale and grim,
and no content could find:
^his Maiden she was nothing moved,
nor from her words would vary,
^ut constantly she did reply,
i will never yield to marry.
My Love quoth he is so entire,
and ^^^me to thee my Dear,
^ho^ love again I much desire,
with many a weeping tear:
Therefore sweet heart be not unkind,
nor say that thou will tarry,
^ut let me prove thy constant Love,
and then consent to marry.
Did thou but know the inward grief,
I suffer for thy Love,
Thy flinty heart would yield relief,
or more abdurate prone:
My legs are grown so weak, that they
my body scarce can carry,
Then yield relief to ease my grief,
and give consent to marry.
No, no, quoth she thy flattring tongue,
shall never obtain his suit,
Thy tempting words have done me wrong,
therefore I pray be mute:
For I am fully purposed,
hence forth to be more wary,
Therefore away make no delay,
for in sooth I will not marry.
He asked her she reason why,
she should reject him so:
She would not such she did reply,
for friend nor yet for foe:
Quoth she my years are yet but green,
I am young enough to tarry.
This twelue-monthes day, therefore away
it is time enough to marry.
Quoth he it makes me half despair,
and troubles much my mind,
That one so comely and so fair,
would e're prove so unkind:
Therefore sweet heart tell me the cause,
that thou so much do vary,
From all the minds of Women kind.
as to refuse to marry.
The second part.
To the same tune.




Did thou but know the sweet delights,
that Marriage does afford:
And how fair Ladies, Lords and Knights
in marriage bed accord:
Thou would not fondly make reply,
thou art young enough to tarry,
But be content and give consent,
without delay to marry.
He that says Love is vanity,
shall never persuade me to it,
Nor yet deny a courtesy,
if any one will do it:
For I have made a Vow quoth she,
and sworn by great King Harry,
That till I have, the thing I crave,
I will not yield to marry.
It I had known the cause quoth he,
why thou did make denial,
I quickly would have preferred thee,
a sweet contenting trial:
Which would have made thee soon consent
though thou were never so wary,
And never more, say as before,
I Will never yield to marry.
Then use your wit the Maid replied,
for now you know the cause,
A Maidens no, proves often I,
to yield to Hymen's laws:
If you prove kind, the Maiden said,
consent and do not tarry,
And then I soon, will change this tune,
and quickly yield to marry.
With that the Youngman bad her, both
keep secret, and prove kind,
And he would verify her Oath,
and satisfy her mind:
Quoth she I shall be satisfied,
if that thou do not vary,
But yet in troth, I am very loath,
to give my grant to marry.
With that they both concluded were,
but wot you how she sped,
By consequence it did appear,
that it her liking bred:
For when her Oath was verified,
that she swore by King Harry,
She never stayde but quickly said,
sweet heart now let us marry.
This Youngmans love, was quickly cold
that here betwixt them past,
Quoth he I will not be too bold,
least I repent at last:
For he that weds too hastily,
had need for to be wary,
Least he repent he gave consent,
without advice to marry.
Fair Maidens all take good advice,
before you give consent,
Unto your Loves in any wise,
these follyes to prevent:
For she that to perform her Vow,
so long a time did tarry,
Was brought to shame and much defame,
before that she did marry.
FINIS.
