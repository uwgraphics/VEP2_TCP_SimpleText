TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY:
The humble Petition of the Major, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of
LONDON.
May it please your most Excellent Majesty, the often expressions of your
Majesty's gracious acceptance, of the manifestation of the Petitioners duty and
loyalty, and the frequent declarations, of your Majesty's great care, of the
good and welfare of this City, and of the true PROTESTANT Religion, and of
protecting and preserving the persons and privileges of your great Council,
Assembled in the high Court of Parliament; Has encouraged the Petitioners to
represent, the great dangers, fears, and destractions, wherein the City now
is, by reason of the prevailing progress, of the bloody Rebels in IRELAND,
fomented and acted by the Papists and their adhaerents, and want of Aid to
suppress them, and the several intimations they have had both Foreign and
at home, of the driving of their designs, tending to the utter ruin of the
PROTESTANT Religion, and the lives and liberties of your Majesty's loyal
Subjects, The putting out of persons of honor and truth, from being Constable
and Lieutenant of the Tower, especially in these times; and the preparation
there lately made: The fortifying of White Hall with men and Ammunition in an
unusual manner, some of which men with provoking language, and violence abused
diverse Citizens passing by, and the drawing diverse swords, and therewith
wounding sundry other Cityzens in Westminster Hall that were untamed. The late
endeavors used to the Innes of Court; the calling in diverse Cannoneers and
other Assistants into Tower: The late discovery of diverse Fireworks in the
hands of a Papist, and the misunderstanding betwixt your Majesty and
Parliament, by reason of misinformations, as they humbly conceive.

Besides all which, the Petitioners fears, are exceedingly increased, by your
Majesty's late going into the House of COMMONS attended with a great multitude
of Armed men, besides your ordinary Guard, for the Apprehending of diverse
Members of that House, to the indagering of your sacred Person, and of the
Persons and privileges of that honorable Assembly.

The effects of all which fears, tend not only to the overthrow of the whole
Trade of this City and Kingdom, which the Petitioners already feel in a deep
measure, but also threatens the utter ruin of the true PROTESTANT Religion,
and the lives and liberties of all your Loyal Subjects.

The Petitioners therefore most humbly pray your Majesty, that by the advice
of your great Counsel in Parliament, the Protestants in IRELAND may be
speedily relieved: The Tower put into the hands of persons of trust, that by
removal of doubtful and unknown persons from about White Hall and
Westminster, a known and approved Guard may be appointed for the safety of
your Majesty and Parliament; And that the Lord MANDIVILE, and the five Members
of the House of COMMONS lately accused may not be restrained of liberty, or
proceeded against, otherwise then according to the privileges of Parliament.

And the Petitiones as in all duty bound shall pray for your Majesty's most
long and happy Reign.
