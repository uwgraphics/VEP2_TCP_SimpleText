A Tragical SONG: OR, Mr. Will. Montfort, The Famous Actor Unfortunately Killed.
Tune of Mary Live L^ng.
GOod People draw near,
And hear my sad Ditty
With Hearts full of Pity,
This Tragical Year
Is bloody indeed:
Some they fairly do fight,
Others stabbed in the Night,
as they do go home,
Brave Montfort the Player,
B^ave Montfort the Player,
He lately was one.
His Name still will last
In Court Town or Country,
By Cits, or the Gentry,
Till Ages are past
For Acts on the Stage;
For in playing a Part,
He excells the famed Heart,
Or Moon that is dead too,
Nay, no one that's living,
Nay, no one that's living,
Can Montfort outdo.
His Carriage was such,
In all Conversation,
To be free from Passion,
And never thought much
To oblige any one;
From a Lord to a Cit,
He was free with his Wit,
And Courteous withal:
But now alas Killing,
But now alas Killing,
Is used all in all.
Each one does lament
His death since life's shortn'd
By bloody misfortune,
And cries out amain
Poor Montfort is gone,
It is all ore the Town,
Was the like ever known,
To use a man so,
when coming to's Lodging,
when coming to's Lodging,
He should be run through.
O cruel hard Fate,
Since Murder's in fashion,
With the English Nation,
That men cannot escape,
Being killed by the Sword;
One can hardly pass by,
But another does cry,
Lets kill the next man.
Some never will leave it,
Some never will leave it,
Until they be hanged.
Here Is Monfort of late,
Tho young and beloved,
How soon Life is moved,
When malice or hate
Shall once resolve Death,
As he went without Light,
He was run through that Night,
And died the next day;
So he that's Moon-blinded,
So he that's Moon blinded
May soon lo^se his way.
London, Printed for Charles Barnes.
