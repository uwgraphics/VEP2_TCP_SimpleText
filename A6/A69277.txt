Wherein the principal and most material doctrines are set down;

By EDWARD ELTON, Bachelor in Divinity, and Preacher of Gods word at Saint
Marie Magailens Barmondsey near London.

LONDON, Printed for Robert Mylbourne, and are to be sold at the great
South-doore of Paul's. 1623.

THE FIRST COMMANDMENT, The Negative Part,
IT forbids,

First, Atheism or denial of God:

Secondly, all false opinions of God:

Thirdly, confidence in creatures. Atheism or denial of God:

First, Psalm. 14.1. 2 King. 6.33. 2 King. 7.2. Malac. 2.17. Malac. 3.14.
when a man does say or at least think there is no God at all; coming to this
kind of Atheism by two steps:

First, by imagining God sees not us, or does not regard us, Psa^ 10.11.
Zephan. 1.12.

Secondly, by imagining that God is not so sharp and severe in punishing
sin, Eccles. 8.11.
as the Scriptures set him forth to be. Psalm. 50.16.17.18.19.20.21.

Secondly, Ephesians. 2.12.
when a man has a false God instead of the true God,

1. Either by placing and worshipping that which is not God, in the room of
the true God, Act. 19.27.35.

2. Or by thinking some other thing besides the true God to be his chiefest
good. Philip. 3.19. Coloss. 3.5.2. Cor. 4.4.

All false opinions of God, as

First, when men join others to God, and do not acknowledge him alone, and
that three ways:

First, 2 King. 17.32 33.41.
by professing more then one religion.

Secondly, by praying to others beside the true God. Deuteronomy. 6.13. Zephan. 1.5.
Deuteronomy. 22.10.11. 1 King. 18.21.
Deuteronomy. 10.20. Mat. 4.10. Ier. 2.10. Act. 1.24. Exodus 22.20.

Thirdly, by magic or witchcraft; and that either by

1. Being Magicians or witches themselves. Psalm. 58.5. Deuteronomy. 18.11.

2. Or by seeking to Magicians or witches, and using their help. 2. King.
1.3.16. Isai. 8.9. Leuit. 20.6.

Secondly when men do not acknowledge God as he is, and as he has revealed
himself in his word, and herein men err in misconceiuing of God, touching his
essence, persons of the Godhead, and attributes. Romans 1.21. Psalm. 96.4.5. Isay
37.19. Ierem. 14.22. 1 Cor. 8.5.


First, his Essence,

1. In making a multiplicitie of gods, and thinking there be many gods.

2. In conceiving God to be that which he is not, and thinking him to be like
to creatures, Act. 17.29.

Secondly, his persons of the Godhead:

1. Gen 1.26. Mat. 3.16.17. Mat. 28.19. 2. Cor. 13.13. 1 Ioh. 5.7.
In denying the three persons.

2. In holding not only the distinction of the persons, but the Ioh. 10.30. 1
Ioh. 5.7.
division also of the substance.

3. In holding Esai. 7.14. Esai. 9.6. Mat. 1.23. Ioh. 1.1. Rom 9.5.
Christ the Son of God, not to be very God.

4. In holding Genesis 3.22 Mat. 28.19. 1. John 5.7.
the three persons of the Godhead, to be but three names and titles given to
God in Scripture.

Thirdly, his Attributes, especially these five.

1. Ezech. 8.12. Job. 22.13.14.
Knowledge, and the misconceiuing of that brings forth hypocrisy.

2. Power, and the misconceiuing of that brings forth,

1. 2 Chronicles. 33 10 and cap. 36.16. Isai. 5.19. Isai. 28.15.22, 2 Pet 3.34.
Contempt of God, showed,

In taking no profit by his punishments.

2. A proud tempting of God, showed,

1. In muttering against God.

2. In seeking experience of his power.

3. In trying whether he be such a Act. 5.9. Malac. 5.15.
powerful God of vengeance as the Scriptures set him forth to be.

3 Psalm. 57.10. Number. 13.2.3. 2 Pet. 3.4.9.
Truth, and the misconceiuing of that brings forth,

Incredulity, showed in doubtfulnesse and diffidence.

2 Psalm. 42.5. Heb. 10.38. Pro. 3.5. 2 King. 6.33 Isai. 28.16. Hab 2.3.4.
Impatience, showed in not waiting on God in time of trial for the
accomplishment of his promise.

4. Genesis 18.25. Ierem. 51.56. Nahum. 1.2.3 2 These. 1.6.7. Romans 2.6.7.8.
Justice, and the misconceiuing of that brings forth,

1. Carnal security, Ierem. 8.6. Mat. 24.38.

2. Spiritual slothfulnes, Reu. 3.15.

3. Rash and inconsiderate zeal. Luke 9.54.

5. Exodus 34.67.2. Chron. 30.9 Isai. 55.7. Iam. 5.11.
Mercy, and the misconceiuing of that brings forth

Desperation. 1. King. 19.4. Act. 16.27. Genesis 4.13.2. Cor. 2.7.

Presumption. 2. Sam. 4.5.7. Eccles. 11.6. Deuteronomy. 29.19.20. Iud. epist. v. 4.

2. Vain glory or carnal boasting. Ioh. 5.44. Luke 10.20.

146.3.
Riches.

2. Strong holds.

3. Honor, authority, high places, and the like.

The affirmative part of the first Commandment.
It requires two things especially. Isai. 8.13. 1 Chronicles. 28.9. Ierem. 9.24.
Ioh. 17.3. Psalm. 9.10. Hoze. 4.16. Coloss. 1.10.


1. That the mind and heart have a due respect to God, acknowledging him to be
such a God as he has revealed himself to be in his word and works.

2. Confidence in God, and that we rest on him alone.

The first is grounded on the true knowledge of God as he has made himself
known in his word, both in his Essence, persons, properties and works.

Expressed

1. In Faith, Psalm. 73.25. Heb. 11.6. Heb. 6.1.
whereof there be three sorts:

1. Fundamental faith, apprehending the essence and being of God.

2. 1 Cor. 13.2.
Faith of Miracles, apprehending the power of God.

3. Iam. 2.19.
Faith of the history, or historical faith, apprehending the truth of God
revealed in his written word.

2 In hope, 2. Chro. 20.1. Isai. 8.17. Psalm. 27.14.
which brings forth spiritual fortitude or courage, standing in

1. Psalm. 37.7. Romans 8.24.25 Ioh. 1.6.7.8.9 Heb. 11.27. 2 Samuel 16.10.11.12.
Iam. 5.11. Deuteronomy. 6.5. Luke 10.27. Act. 17.28. Iam 1.17. Mal. 3.16. Psalm.
119.55. 2 Timothy 4.8.

2. Constancy in good things.

3. Patience in time of trouble and adversity.

3. In love to God, manifested,

1. In often thinking and speaking of God to his glory, and desiring his
presence.

2. In loving his word and ordinances.

3. In loving his children and servants.

4. In loving his glory, Psalm. 27.4. Psalm. 119.97.131. Psalm. 16.3. 1 Ioh. 5.21.
Exodus 32.12.32. Ioh. 14.1. Genesis 18.27. Isai. 8.13. Heb. 12.28.29
and being zealous for that above all things.

5. In doing his will cheerfully. Bringing forth effects,

Properly respecting God, namely

1. An holy submission to the majesty of God.

2. The fear of God, which brings forth

1. An hatred of sin, Pro. 8.13. Job 31.23. Genesis 20.11. Romans 3.18. Heb. 12.28.
and a careful avoiding of the offense of God.

2. A care to approve our selves to God in all things

Is of two sorts

1. Childlike. Psalm. 130.4.1. Pet. Genesis 39.9.
1.17.

2. Servile. 1. John 4.18. Romans 13.5.

These two differing each from other in the Cause and Object.

More nearely respecting our selves. 1 Cor. 1.7. 2 Cor. 3.5.


Denial of our selves, Mat. 16.24. Luke 9.23. Pro. 3.7. 1 Cor. 3.18. Romans 8.7.
expressed

1. In renouncing utterly our own reason, will, and affections, as of
themselves enemies to God and all goodness.

2 In submitting our selves wholly to Gods wisdom and will in all things,
Genesis 12.1.4. Genesis 22.1.2.9. Heb. 11.8. Deuteronomy. 33.9. Mat. 4.20. Luke 5.10. Act
20.24. Genesis 32.10. 1 Chronic. 29 14.15.16. 1. Cor. 4.7. 1 Cor. 1.31. 1 Cor.
15.9. 1 Timothy 1.15. Romans 12.10. 1. Cor. 4.6. 1 Pet. 5.5. Philip. 2.23. Phil.
4.11.12. 1 Cor. 12.7.
though never so contrary to our wills and desires.

Humility, making men

1 Think most basely of themselves, in regard of their own corruption and
sins.

2 Esteem better of others then of themselves, having the same good gifts that
they have; and to respect them accordingly.

3 Content with their particular places and conditions of life, not to presume
beyond that ability and strength that is given them.

The second is grounded on due acknowledgement of Gods

1 Good providence and mercy. 2 Chro. 20.20 Psalm. 37.3.5. Psalm. 27.1.2.3. 2 Timothy 1.12. Psalm. 33.18.19 Psalm. 84.11.12. Psalm. 91.


2 Power.

3 Former experience of his power and providence toward our selves and others:

Bringing forth

A conversation void of covetousness and distrustful care.

Invocation or calling on the name of God, Pro. 16.3. Mat. 6.25. 1 Timothy
6.6.7.8.9.10. Dan. 9.7.18. Psalm. 50.15. Iam. 1.5.
standing

In Petition and thanksgiving.

The second Commandment. The Negative part.
The second Commandment contains,

1 A precept or commandment.

2 A confirmation of the commandment by arguments persuading to the obedience
of it.

The precept or commandment forbids all manner of Idolatry, under which is
forbidden, Ezech. 14.3.4.7. Deuteronomy. 27.15. 1 Ioh. 5.21. Exodus 23.24. Deuteronomy. 7.25.
Deuteronomy. 12.3.


1 Inward Idolatry of the heart, which is when men misconceiuing God, do
worship him according to that misconceit.

2 Outward Idolatry of the hand, which is when men make an image or similitude,
and erect and set it up for religious use. And that is done two ways,

1 By making and erecting an image representing either some feigned god, Deuteronomy.
4.15.16 Isay 40.18.25 Act. 17.29. Romans 1.23. Hoze. 13.2. Deuteronomy. 7.25.26 1 King.
18.19. 1 Cor. 6.20. Deuteronomy. 7.2.3. Ezra. 9.2.12.14. 2 Chronicles. 19.2. Psalm.
106.35.36. Mal. 2.11. 2 Cor. 6.14.15.16.
or that which is not God.

2 By making and erecting an image of the true God and of Christ to worship it.

3 Approbation of Idolatry by presence, speech, gesture, silence, etc.

4 All unnecessary dealing or familiarity with Idolaters.

2 Contempt of the outward worship of God, which is

1 Inward, when men in their hearts contemn the holy ordinances of God, Ezech.
22.8. Mat. 22.5. Luke 14.18.19.20. Mal. 3.14. Job. 2.15. 1 Cor. 1.18.21
and the duties and parts of his worship, and think basely of them; which
brings forth either,

1 Neglect of them altogether.

2 Or intermission of the duties of Gods worship. 2 Chronicles. 30.5


3 Or an hypocritical coming unto them, Isai. 29.13.
and a formal performance of them.

2 Outward, Number. 11.2.6. Act. 17.18.
when men openly manifest their contempt of the holy ordinances of God, and the
duties and parts of his worship, either by word or deed, and that

1 Either in part contemning the Preaching of the word, etc. 2 These. 5.20. 2
Chro. 30.10


2 Or in wholl, Psalm. 14.4. Heb. 12.16. Compared with Genesis 25.34.
contemning all the holy ordinances of God, and all the holy duties of his
worship, which is properly called Profaneness.

3 All humane devises, Mark. 7.3.4.
or superstition in the worship of God, (that is) such things in the worship of
God, as are invented by men; and are contrary unto the rule of Gods word; and
such things men do devise two ways,

1 By adding something to the essential worship of God: and things added are,

1 Either, things merely devised by men, having no warrant at all in the word
of God.

2 Or things in themselves indifferent, Mar. 7.3.4.
made necessary parts of Gods essential worship.

2 By detracting something from the worship of God, contrary to Gods word.

And humane devises are

1 Either such as men take up of themselves upon a bare and naked good intent,
1 Samuel 13.9.10 13.
thinking that thereby they worship God, Coloss. 2. vlt.
which is properly called wilwor-ship.

2 Or they are such as have been devised by others, Ezech. 20.18. Mat. 15.2.
Mar. 7.3.
and received from them, properly called traditions of the Elders.

The affirmative part of the second Commandment.
It requires that the true God be worshipped with spiritual worship, Exodus
25.9. Deuteronomy. 12.32. Isa. 1.12. Ioh. 4.23.24. Isai. 1.13.14.15. Isai. 66.3.
or after a spiritual manner. And that

1 Standing in two things

1 In worshipping God in such things as are agreeable to his will.

2 In worshipping God in things and duties commanded of God, in such manner as
is agreeable to the nature of God, in spirit and truth. John 4.22. Micha.
6.6.7.8


2 Grounded on true and sound knowledge of the express will of God, Mat. 15 9.
Eccles. 4.17.
teaching all the parts of his worship, and the manner of the performance of
them.

3 Is to be expressed in the exercise and performance of those things that
concern the holy and solemn service of God, (namely) the true and ordinary
means of holiness, and the parts of Gods worship; which are especially

1 Prayer, 1. Sam. 1.15. Psalm. 42.4. Isai. 37.4. Lam. 3.41. 1. Cor. 2.4. 1.
Cor. 14.24.25. Act. 26.2.5.
public and private, standing in petition, and thanksgiving.

2 The Ministry of the word of God. 1. Cor. 11.23. 1. Pet. 4.11.

3 The Sacraments. 1 Cor. 10.16

4 Is expressed in the using of the ordinary means of holiness, and the
parts of Gods worship, after an holy manner. 1. Tim. 4.8. Romans 14.17.


5 Is helped forward and furthered by such things as do bind, and stir up
men to the performance of holy duties; which things are 1 Special vows. 2
Religious fasting.
The confirmation of the Commandment by Arguments persuading to the obedience
of it, taken

1 Partly from the nature of God, in two Attributes; as that he is

1 Strong (that is) able to punish the disobedient, Nahum. 1.3.4.5.6. Apocal.
18.8 Dan. 3.17. Dan. 6.20.21.22. Romans 8.31. Hoze. 10.19.20. Ierem. 2.2. Ierem 3
1.2.6.7. Ezech 16.15.16.17. etc.
and to maintain and defend all such as truly worship him against all that
oppose them.

2 Jealous (that is) loving his Church with exceeding great and superabundant
holy love, being exceedingly offended for Idolatry, and executing his wrath
most sharply upon Idolaters.

2 Partly, from the effects of his,

1 Anger, Exodus 20.5.
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third
generation and upon the fourth of them that hate me, (that is) taking notice of
iniquity, and punishing the iniquity of the fathers upon their children going
on in their sins, to the third and fourth generation.

2 Love, Exodus 20.6.
showing mercy unto thousands, to them that love me and keep my commandments,
(that is) doing good to many generations of the faithful successively, going on
in the steps of their godly parents, and obeying God as they did.

The third Commandment. The Negative part.
The third Commandment contains,

First, a precept or commandment.

Secondly, a commination or threatening denounced against the breakers of it.

The precept forbids all manner of profanation and abuse of Gods name,
standing in the abuse of his titles, hi attributes, his works, and his word,
and his holy ordinances.

First, his titles are abused, when men take them into their mouths and use
them in their speech irreverently, and without due respect; and that either
without an oath, or with an oath.

1 Without an oath, as when men mention any of Gods titles in their common
talk rashly, Deuteronomy. 28.58.
carelessly and irreverently; and that either

In a foolish admiration upon some sudden accident or strange report, saying
Good God, oh Lord, oh Jesus. Philip 2.10.

In idle wishes, and imprecations, Genesis 16.5.
as when men wish il to themselves, or to others, and use the name of God in
their wishes.

In cursing, as when men say, Gods curse light on such, etc. Iam. 3.9.10. 2.
Sam. 16.7.8.

In praising God for evil things, 1. Sam. 23.21.

2 With an oath, as when men swear by them in their speech, lightly and
profanely, and that either

1 By God calling for a witness of vain and frivolous things, Ierem. 23.10.
Hoze. 4.2. Mat. 5.37.
by usual swearing in their common talk.

2 By calling God for a witness of their furious anger, 1. Sam. 14.34. 1. Sam.
25.34.
by passionate swearing.

3 By calling God for a witness of an untruth, Z^ch. 5.4. Leuit. 19.12.
by swearing falsely, or forswearing themselves; which is done

1 By swearing that which they know or think to be false, Mat. 26.72.
and that either directly against their knowledge, or deceitfully.

2 By swearing to do that which they mean not to do. Psalm. 15.4.

3 By swearing to do a thing which they also mean to do, 2. Chro. 36.13 Ezech.
17.13.14.15.
and is lawful to be done, and yet afterward do it not; and this is perjury
except in these two cases,

1 If after the oath taken, God make the thing promised impossible to be done.

2 If the thing that men swear to do, be not simply required to be done, but
either the doing of that thing or some other thing proportionable unto it.

The highest degree of perjury is, Leuit. 24.11.15.16.
when men forswear themselves, in public before a Magistrate.

The highest degree of vnreuerent using of Gods titles, is blaspheming of them,
by speaking basely, contumeliously, or reprochfully of any of them.

Secondly, his Attributes are abused, when men think or speak of them
otherwise then beseemes the perfect purity and holiness of them, (namely) by
thinking or speaking of any of them rashly and irreverently, or by perverting
any of them to a wrongful use. And the Attributes of God, that are most
commonly thus abused, are

1 His power, which is abused

1 Either, Exodus 5.2. Psalm. 12.4. 2. King. 18.30 34.35. 2. King. 7.2.
when men call the greatness of it into question.

2 Or when men speak of it carnally, and carelessly, or contemptuously.

2 His providence, which is abused, when men being under the hand of God, do
fret and show themselves displeased, with the work of his providence, and that

3 Either, by murmuring against it directly and in plain terms. Deuteronomy. 1.27.

2 Or, by speaking grudgingly against the work of his providence, under other
names, as under the name of Chance or Fortune.

3 His justice, which is abused, Psalm. 50.21. Mal. 3.13.14. Job. 21.14.
when men either think or say, that God approues of sin or wicked sinners.

4 His mercy, which is abused

1 Either, when men pervert it and misapplie it, presuming upon it to harden
their hearts in sinning, Deuteronomy, 29.19.20.

2 Or when men speak basely or contemptuously of Gods mercy.

5 His patience, which is abused, when on Gods patience and forbearance for a
time to punish them for their sins, Zephan. 1.12. Romans 2.4.
men think or say that God will neither do good nor evil.

3 His works are abused, when men think or speak of any of them, or use any
of them irreverently and without due respect: and the works of God which are
thus abused, are

1 Either, the wonderful and unsearchable works of God, within himself, Romans
9.19.20 Romans 11.33.
(namely) his eternal election and reprobation, which are thought or spoken of
irreverently, when men cavil against them, and seek to bring them within the
compass of their shallow reason.

2 Or, the outward works of God, which are thought or spoken of, or used
irreverently, either when men see not God in his works; or when they use them
not as they ought to be used. And these works of God that are thus abused, are

1 Either the works of creation, the creatures of God which are abused

1 When men think or speak basely of any of them, Number. 11.6. Psalm. 78.18.
and debase their goodness and discommend them.

2 When men deride the wormanship of God, in any of them, Genesis 21.9. 2 King.
2.23.
especially in man or woman, in regard of some natural defect, deformity, or
infirmity of body or mind.

3 When men beholding any of Gods creatures, Psalm. 19.1. Psalm. 139.14.
give not him the due praise and glory of his wisdom and power appearing in
them.

4 When men pervert any of the creatures of God to a wrong use, either
contrary to, or differing from the good use for which God has ordained them,
Genesis 1.14. Isai 47.13.
as to enchantment, etc.

5 When men swear by them, Ierem. 5.7.
especially by the body of Christ, and the parts and members of his blessed
body.

2 Or the works of Gods administration and providence; and those are

1 Either the works of his providence that fall out and come to pass in the
common course of this life, 1. Sam. 15.17.18.19. 2 Samuel 12.7.8.9.10. Isa.
5.1.2.3.4. Mat. 21.33.34
which are abused when men have such an opinion of those works which has no
ground for it either in the word of God, or in the course of nature; as that it
is unlucky to pull on the shoes awrie in the morning.

2 Or the works of Gods mercy, his blessings; which are abused

1 When men receive them unthankfully, and requite them unkindly.

2 When men swear by any work of mercy, as by the death of Christ, or by any
good gift of God, as by their faith, etc.

3 The works of Gods justice, which are abused, Josh. 22.17. Luke 13.1.2.3
when men lightly pass over the judgments of God seen in the world.

4 His word and his holy ordinances, which are abused when men think or speak
of them or any part of them, or use any of them or any part of them, otherwise
then beseemes the holiness of them, and the excellent use of them; they being
such as do most clearly and familiarly make God himself and all his goodness
known unto us. And this is done either generally, or particularly:

1 Generally.

First, 2. Chron. 36.16. Act. 2.13. Psalm. 5.16.17. 2. Tim. 3.7. Heb. 5.12. 2.
Sam. 12.14. Ierem. 34.16. Romans 2.24. Tit. 1.16.
when men use them irreverently or scornfully.

Secondly, when men use them fruitlesly, and are not bettered by them in
knowledge, faith, etc.

Thirdly, when men make profession of religion, and yet live wickedly.

Fourthly, when men shrink in case of peril, and deny God the honor of their
suffering for his truth. Mat. 10.33. Ioh. 12.42. Gal. 2.12.13. Mat. 7.6. Luke
22.67.


Fifthly, when men profess the truth of God, or speak of good thing
unseasonably, or at times not convenient.

2 Particularly, as

First, the word of God is abused, and that

1 When men take any part of it into their mouths, 1. Pet. 4.11. Isai.
22.12.13. 2 Pet. 3.4.
and use it in their speech, either irreverently, idly and vainly, or in
mockage.

2 When men pervert it, or any part of it to a wrong use.

1 When men use any part of it to curious and needless questions. 1. Tim 6.4.
1. Tim. 1.4. Tit. 1.4.


2 Mat. 5.39.
When men use any part of it to jesting and profane mirth.

3 Eccles. 3 4. 1. Tim. 5.8. Exodus 22.25. Deuteronomy. 23.19. Mark 3.5. Ephesians. 4 26.
Psalm. 50.18.
When men use any part of it for the maintenance and defense of any error,
heresy, or sin.

4 When men turn any part of it to a charm or sorcery.

Secondly, the Sacraments, which are abused

1 By giving that unto them which belongs not unto them, as

1 When men give to them power to confer and give grace by the very work
wrought. Romans 4.10.11. Ephesians. 5.26. 1. Pet. 3.21.


2 When men give to them an absolute necessity, and hold them absolutely
necessary to salvation. John 3.8.

3 When men give to them adoration, as the Papists do, Mat. 4.10.

2 By perverting of them and applying them to a wrong use, as namely to such
things or to such uses as God has not appointed them, as Baptism to the
consecrating of bells, to drive away devils, etc.

Thirdly, Prayer, which is abused

1 When men pray for such things as are not agreeable to the will of God, as for
the dead, Iam. 4.3. John 5.14.

2 When men use prayer to unlawful ends, as sorcery, enchantment, etc.

Hereunto is added the abuse of the holy lot, which is an ordinance of God
appointed for special ends, etc. which is abused

1 When men use it irreverently, Pro. 16.33.
as in light and trifling matters, or in way of sport.

2 When men pervert it, Pro. 18.18. 1. Sam. 10.21.
and use it to wrong ends; as to search their fortune, and what success they
shall have in their affairs, by casting a die.

The affirmative part of the third Commandment.
It requires a sober, 1. Cor. 10.31.
religious and honorable usage of Gods holy name, Mat. 6.10. Number. 25.28. 1.
King 19.10
and that in all things we give him his due glory, and that grounded on a true
zeal of Gods glory; and standing,

1 In yielding due reverence to the name of God.

2 In making a wise and holy confession of the truth of God.

First, yielding due reverence to the name of God, and that either in speech or
action.

In speech, which is, Pro. 31.26. Psalm. 71.15.
when men having occasion to use the name of God, do wisely make mention of it,
and reverently, and to good use and edification; and that either without an
oath, or in the lawful use of an oath.

Without an oath, which is to be expressed in speaking of his holy titles;
which is, Deuteronomy. 28.58. Romans 9.5.
when men use them in their speech, only in serious matters, and with fear
and trembling, and to the good of men, and praise of God.

2 Of his attributes, Psalm. 40.9.10. Psalm. 66.16. Psalm. 107.8.
when men break forth into such a declaration of Gods power, wisdom, goodness
etc. as both themselves and others are, or may be thereby stirred up to
magnify those holy attributes, and more earnestly to praise God for the same.

3 Of his word and the parts of his worship; Deuteronomy. 6.7. Psalm. 37.30.31 Pro.
10.21.
which is, when men speak of them with such care and reverence as beseems the
holiness and excellency of them, and apply them only to those good uses for
which God has ordained them.

4 Of his works, Exodus 15.1. to 23. Psalm. 136. wholl. Psalm. 145.17.20.21.
which is, when men speak of them, of what sort or kind soever they be, with
reverence and with an approbation of the good and excellency of them, and do
give God the due praise of his wisdom, power, and goodness, appearing in the
same.

In the lawful use of an oath, which is, when men swear by the name of God,
having a lawful calling thereunto, and do it lawfully.

And men have a lawful calling to swear,

1 When the Magistrate upon a just occasion does require an oath by the order
of justice, Genesis 43.3. 1. Sam. 24.22.23.
and does minister the same lawfully, so as it be not against piety or
charity.

2 When their own calling, general or particular, necessarily requires an
oath; as (namely)

1 When the taking of an oath, may further Gods glory and worship, Gal. 1.20.
1 Thessalonians. 2.5.
or may serve to prove some doctrine of salvation in whole or in part.

2 When the taking of an oath, serves to maintain and further a man's own or
others salvation, 2. Cor. 1.23. Psalm. 119.106.
in soul or in body.

3 When the taking of an oath serves to further brotherly love, Genesis 21.23.24
Genesis 31.53.
and to confirm lawful peace and society between party and party, country
and country.

4 When a man by an oath, and not otherwise, Romans 1 9. 1 Thessalonians. 2.10.
may maintain his own good name, and life, or goods.

And that men may swear lawfully, Gal. 1.20. 2. Cor. 1.23.
they must know that an oath is

A calling of God to witness for the necessary confirmation, either of the
unknown truth of their speech touching things of great importance, or the
truth of the promise they make to do some thing or things that are of weight
likewise, and lawful, and possible; and a wishing God to punish them, if
either they lie, or wittingly and willingly do otherwise then they promise: and
it is either

An affirming oath,

Or a promising oath.

And they must look that they swear,

1 In truth, Ierem. 4.2.
which implies

1 That the thing they swear unto, be a truth, and that they know it so to be,
or at least think it so, and be persuaded in conscience that it is a truth.

2 That they swear simply and plainly, without fraud or deceit, Psalm. 15.4.
Psalm. 24.4.
nor swering one thing, and meaning another.

2 In judgment, which is with deliberation and due consideration of the nature
and greatness of an oath, and of the matter they swear unto, Exodus 22.11.
Deuteronomy. 6.13.
and of the particular circumstances, of time, place, and persons, before whom
they swear; and in taking of the oath, that they have a reverent care and
fear of Gods Majesty.

3 In righteousness, which implies,

1 That the thing they swear unto, 1. Sam. 25.22.
be iustand lawful.

2 That their calling to swear be just and warrantable.

3 That their swearing be directed to a right end, (namely) to Gods glory, and
peace among men. Heb. 6.16.

Here added, that an oath taken touching things certain, lawful, and
possible, binds the conscience, though it be taken by creatures or by false
gods; and again, that an oath may lawfully be broken in six cases.

Men yield due reverence to the name of God in Action; which is when the
actions of men tend to the glory of God, 1. Cor. 10.31. Coloss. 3.17.
and whatsoever they do, they do it to that end principally that God may be
glorified; and that either in general, or particular.

In general, Mat. 5.16. 1. Pet. 2.12. Revel. 2.13.
as (namely) when they live so holily and so behave themselves, as that in
their whole conversation they bring glory to Gods name.

Or in particular, and that

1 When the power and fruit of the word of God, Psalm. 119.105. Luke 8.15.
and other means of salvation, is expressed in their particular actions as
occasion is offered.

2 When men do sanctify Gods blessings, chastisements, 1. Tim. 4.5.
and ordinances, and the works of their callings, by the word of God, and
prayer.

By the word of God, by taking instruction from thence touching the lawful use
of them, Psalm. 119.24.
and how to use them after an holy manner.

By prayer, (namely)

1 By petition, craving assistance of Gods grace, Genesis 24.12. 2. Chro. 16.12
Ioh. 6.11. Act. 27.35. Act. 21.5.
and his blessing in the lawful use of his blessings, etc. as particular
occasion is offered.

2 By thanksegiuing, magnifying the name of the Lord, Genesis 24.27. Deuteronomy. 8.10.
Exodus 18 10. 2. Sam. 22.
and returning thanks to him for his grace, aid and blessing vouchsafed in the
lawful use of his blessings, etc. as particular occasion is likewise offered.

Secondly, in making a wise and holy confession of the truth of God, Isa. 44.5.
Mat. 10.32.33 Mar. 8.38.
which is to confess the whole truth of God and his religion plainly, boldly
and religiously, when and wheresoever any just occasion is offered; and that
either by word or practice.

1 Romans 10.10. 1. Pet. 3.15.16
By word, (namely) by Christian apology, which is, when men are ready to
confess the truth of God and his religion, and do indeed with fear and
meekness confess it so often as on just cause they are thereunto required.

1 Psalm. 22.22. 1 Thessalonians. 5.11.
Either in public by the Magistrate, or in private by friends, peaceably and
without violence.

2 Mat. 10.18.19 Act. 5.27.28. Act. 26.
Or are thereunto drawn by violence of the enemies and persecutors of the
Church of God, and that before malicious enemies, being thereunto called, and
seeing Gods glory endangered, and his truth spoken against.

2 By practice, and that

1 Dan. 6.10.11. Genesis 12.7.8. Genesis 21.33.
By showing forth the truth of religion by practice, though it be with danger
to lose their lives for it.

2 By witnessing and sealing the doctrine of faith and truth of religion, Act.
7.58.59. Act 22.20. Heb. 11.37. Revel. 2.13.
by their cheerful suffering, yea by shedding their blood without fear or
shrinking, being thereunto called; which is known

First, by finding that God puts into them the spirit of courage, and gives
them resolution to abide and to stand out against the force of all the enemies
of the truth.

Secondly, if being in the hands of the Magistrate, and God cutting off all
lawful means of escaping, the Magistrate do then inflict on them tortures and
torments, and do take away their lives for the truths sake, though unjustly.

Thus much concerning the negative and affirmative parts of the Commandment;
now follows the commination or threatening.

The commination or threatening denounced against the breakers of it,

Including:

1 The greatness of the punishment that shall be inflicted on the offenders
against this commandment.

2 The ineuitablenesse of it. Nahum. 1.3.6. 1. Sam. 2.25.


And containing in effect thus much; that howsoever man's law for the most part
takes not hold of offenders against this commandment, Psalm. 1.5.
Ierem. 23.10. Zach. 5.3.4.
and they escape punishment amongst men; yet God will not acquit them, nor
suffer them to escape his just and fearful judgment, because his exact
justice cannot let so heinous a sin escape unpunished, as is the profanation
of his name; which is most heinous, Isai. 42.8. Isai. 48.11.


1 Because Gods glory is the last and principal, and for which all things
were ordained, and is most dear to himself.

2 Because in profaning Gods name, men show most insolent contempt of God.

3 Because God appointed in the judicial law, not only the blasphemer
himself to be punished by death, Leuit. 24.14. Leuit. 5.1.
but also every person that should hear blasphemy or a false oath, and not
reveal it.

The end of the third Commandment.
The fourth Commandment. The affirmative part.
The fourth Commandment is partly ceremonial, and partly moral and
perpetual.

1 It is ceremonial, and that in respect

1 Of the strict rest which the Jews were commanded to keep on the Sabbath,
Exodus 31.13.
standing in these things:

That they might not prepare or dress that which they should eat. Exodus
16.23.29. Exodus 35.3. Number. 15.32. etc.


Not kindle a fire.

Nor take a journey any whither for any matter or business of their own on
the Sabbath.

2 Of this, Deuteronomy. 5.15.
that the Jews were to keep the Sabbath as a remembrance of their deliverance
out of Egypt.

3 Of this, Deuteronomy. 5.14. Exodus 31.17. Number. 28.9.10
that the Jews were to observe and keep the seventh day from the creation,
and that with sacrifices and ceremonies proper to that day.

2 It is moral and perpetual, and that in two respects, as

1 Isai. 58.13.
In that it requires a certain seventh day to be kept as a day of holy rest
for the preservation of the Ministry of the word.

2 Exodus 23.12.
In that it freeth all from bodily labors, and especially servants and cattle.

As it is moral it requires an holy rest unto God on the seventh day in every
week, Exodus 16.23. Exodus 35.2.
called the Sabbath or the Lords day; and to the keeping of that holy rest we
are to prepare our selves by thinking on the Sabbath before it come, Luke 23.54.
and so disposing of our selves and affairs, that we may freely and duly
attend on the duties of it when it is come; and by rising early in the morning
on the Sabbath, and fitting our selves for the performance of public duties,
by taking account of our hearts and lives. And the keeping of that holy rest
unto God, stands in doing the duties of the Sabbath with reverence, Isai.
58.13. Deuteronomy. 33.3.
as before the Lord of heaven and earth, and with cheerfulness and delight,
both in public and in private: and the public duties are either works of
piety, or works of mercy.

Works of piety (namely) such spiritual works as tend to the solemn and
public worship of God; which are,

1 Nehem. 8.3.8 Luke. 4.16. to 22. Act. 13.14.15.16. Act. 20.7. Act. 2.42. Act.
16.13. Psalm. 92. in titulo. 1. Cor. 14.15.16. Coloss. 3.16.
A reverent and attentive hearing of the word of God, purely and faithfully
preached or read in the public assembly.

2 A joining with the Minister and congregation publicly assembled, with
assent of mind and fervent affection of heart, in public prayer and calling
on the name of the Lord, and in thanksgiving and singing of Psalms.

3 A reverent, and frequent and often communicating in the Sacraments, Act.
20.7. 1. Cor. 11.20.
publicly administered by the Ministers of the Church lawfully called.

Works of mercy, which are these: Collection is to be made for the poor, 1.
Cor. 16.1.2 Romans 15.26. 2. Cor. 8.3.4.
and alms is to be given for the relief of the poor, whether they be such as
dwell among us, or those that be captives and strangers.

The private duties to be done on the Sabbath, are also either works of
piety, or works of mercy.

1 Works of piety, (namely) such as tend to the further edifying and building
up of our selves and others in knowledge, and in grace, and holiness; and they
are

1 Psalm. 119.11.97. Luke 2.51.
A due and serious meditation on the word of God which we have heard in
public, laboring to apply it in every part of it particularly to our selves.

2 Examination and holy conference, Act. 17.11. Mar. 4.33.34. Deuteronomy. 6.7.
that we call to mind, and examine things delivered in the public ministry of
the word, and confer of them with our families and others.

3 John 17.17. 1. Cor. 3.6.7. Iam. 1.5.
Private prayer, that we privately pray to the Lord and crave a blessing on his
ordinances we have been made partakers of, and give him thanks for the good we
have received by them. Act. 16.16.


4 Deu. 17.19. Ioh 5.39. Revel. 1.3.
Private reading of the Scriptures.

5 Isai. 58.13. Exodus 15.12. Iam. 5.13.
Singing of Psalms to the praise of God, and to the stirring up of spiritual
joy and cheerfulness in our hearts.

6 Psalm. 92.4.5.6.
Meditation and due consideration of the works of God, especially his works
of mercy.

2 Works of mercy, (namely) such duties of love as concern either,

1 The good of the souls of our brethren; as that we within compass of our
callings, and according to the measure of grace and gifts, 1. Pet. 4.10. 1 Thessalonians. 5.11.14.
do instruct, exhort, admonish, reprove and comfort those that be about us, and
others, as just occasion is offered.

2 The good of the bodies of our brethren; Nehem. 8.12. Mar. 3.3.4.5. Luke
13.10. to 18. Ioh. 5.8.9. and 9.14.
as that we visit the sick, and do them what good we can, relieve the poor
and needy, and such as be in prison, or in any other misery, according to our
ability.

3 Or such as concern the outward peace of our brethren; as that we endeavor
to preserve the good name of our brethren, Mat. 5.9. 1. Cor. 6.5.6.
and labor to reconcile such as be at variance and discord among themselves.

The Negative part contains a prohibition, and the extent of the prohibition.

A prohibition, which forbids the doing of such things or works as do any way
hinder the keeping of an holy rest unto God on the Sabbath: Ierem. 17.24.
and those works are either works of profit, or works of pleasure.

Works of profit (namely) the common labors of our ordinary sallings and
course of life; and those are,

1 Either such as are usual in the six days of the week.

2 Or such as are usual at certain peciall times in the year or month.

Such as are usual in the six days of the week, which hinder the keeping of
an holy rest unto God on the Sabbath three ways.

1 When upon the Sabbath our minds and hearts are taken up with thoughts and
cares about our ordinary worldly works and businesses, Isai. 58.13. Luke. 8.14.
we are thinking of them, plotting and casting how, etc.

2 When on the Sabbath, Isai. 58.13. Amos 8.4.5.
we are talking and speaking of our ordinary worldly works and businesses, in
making bargains, reckening with servants, with laborers, and workmen, etc.

3 When on the Sabbath we do our ordinary worldly works and businesses, Exodus
16.28.29. Exodus 31.14. Nehem. 13.15.17. Ierem. 17.22. Mar. 16.1.
in whole or in part, be it never so little a part of them, as setting forward
any of our worldly works against the day following.

Exception.

Yet some works may be done on the Sabbath, and not hinder the keeping of an
holy rest unto God on that day, (namely) these

1 Works that concern the practice and performance of the public duties on
the Sabbath, Act. 1.^2. 2. King. 4.23. Mat. 12.5.
as (namely) such as are necessarily to be done in and about the public
worship of God, and the actions of piety belonging to that day, as

1 The Sabbath days journey to hear or to Preach the word of God.

2 The sounding of trumpets or bells and such like, for the gathering of the
people together at a certain time.

2 Works of present necessity, Act. 20.9.10.
(namely) such works as concern the immediate preservation of the temporal
life or liuelihood of man or beast, or that serve to the good estate of either
of them; and that either in ordinary cases, or in such as fall out
extraordinarily.

And present necessity is twofold.

1 That which men contract and draw on themselves, as (namely) when men out of
a covetous mind take on them more business in their calling then they can
dispatch in the six days of the week; or for want of wise and well ordering
their business, it being such as if they would, might be done the day before, or
the day following; or when through negligence or forgetfulness, they bring on
themselves some ordinary business; in this kind of necessity men ought not to
labor on the Sabbath.

2 That which is laid on them by the immediate hand and providence of God, as
(namely) when not through any neglect, oversight or other corruption of their
own, but by the immediate providence of God, some business of their ordinary
calling is laid on them, which could not be done the day before, neither can be
left undone till the day after; in this kind of necessity men may labor on
the Sabbath, these cautions observed,

1 That their labor be with as little hinderance of them from public holy
exercises, as possibly may be.

2 That in laboring, their minds be exercised in holy meditations.

3 That they make not their work a work of gain, 1. King. 19.8. 1. King.
20.29. Mat. 12.7.
but a work of mercy, or tending to a work of mercy.

4 That it serve to the immediate preservation of life, health, or goods.

3 Works of Christian liberty, (namely) such works as did belong to the
strict rest which the Jews were commanded to keep on the Sabbath, Mar. 2.27.
Mat. 12.1.2.3. Luke 6.5.
and such as they might not do, and yet we may do now under the new Testament,
as the dressing of necessary food, making of fires, making of beds; which may
be done on the Sabbath, and not hinder the keeping of an holy rest, two rules
observed.

1 That they be done without hindering the doers of them at the least
ordinarily from the public holy exercises, as when they are done in the time
before, or after, or between the public exercises.

2 When the doers of them have their minds exercised with holy and heavenly
meditations. 2. Sam. 23.15.16.17.


Works of pleasure, which are either lawful in themselves, and such as at
other times may be used: or simply in themselves unlawful at all times.

Works of pleasure lawful in themselves, and such as at other times may be
used, which are,

1 Either set and solemn feasting and banqueting, Isai. 5.12. Luke 21.34.36
as at marriages.

2 Or some kind of recreations and exercises of the body.

Set and solemn feasting and banqueting at marriages, which hinder the keeping
of an holy rest on the Sabbath:

When they are used on the Sabbath, and thereby Cooks, and other officers are
employed in their ordinary works, and are toyled exceedingly; and those that
do feast and banquet, are hindered, and have their minds withdrawn from the
serious performance of holy duties both public and private.

Some kind of recreations and exercises of the body, (namely) such moderate
mouings of the body as be honest, and carry with them an honest and
delightsome exercise of the mind, Exodus 22.6.
and serve to the refreshing both of body and mind, as shooting etc. which
hinder the keeping of an holy rest on the Sabbath, when they are used on the
Sabbath, especially at the time of divine Service.

1 Because labor in a man's lawful calling, which is more necessary and
profitable, is forbidden on the Sabbath.

Therefore recreation which is for labor, and less necessary, though lawful
at other times, must then cease, when labor ceasseth.

2 Labor in a man's lawful calling is forbidden on the Sabbath; because it
hinders the keeping of an holy rest to God on the Sabbath: therefore recreation
though lawful at other times, is not to be used on the Sabbath, it being no
less but rather more an hinderance to the keeping of an holy rest unto God on
the Sabbath, then bodily labor.

Works of pleasure, simply in themselves unlawful at all times, are either,

1. Known sins, as surfeiting, drunkenness, Isai 56.2. Ezech. 23.38.39.
Romans 13.13.
whore dome and such like, which hinder the keeping of the holy rest on the
Sabbath when they are done on the Sabbath; for then to commit any known sin is
to keep an holy day to the devil, and not to God.

2 Or such as go under the name of sports and recreations, as (namely) such
delights as have a manifest defiling of good manners in the doing or in the
beholding, having in them allurement and prouocations,

The extent of the prohibition.

It is extended to all men and women of years and discretion, Deuteronomy. 5.14.
of what place, calling or condition soever in the world; and to all other
things that may be set on work by them; Deuteronomy. 22.4.
especially the charge is laid on such as be superiors and governors, whether
in private or in public, as namely,

1 A master or governor of a family is bound to cease from doing such things
and works as do hinder the keeping of an holy rest to God on the Sabbath, not
only in his own person, but in all that be under him; he is to look to all
others that be under his charge, yea even to strangers and guests that on the
Sabbath be within his liberty and power.

2 A governor in public, a Magistrate is bound to cease from doing such
things and works as do hinder the keeping of an holy rest to God on the
Sabbath, not only in his own person, but in all that be under his government:
he must look to all others, yea to strangers that be within his liberty and
jurisdiction on the Sabbath, that they also cease, etc.

And masters and Magistrates must restrain such as be under them, or
strangers being within their liberty on the Sabbath, from works of profit,
and works of pleasure, by

Commandment, admonition, reproof, if these will serve the turn; if not, by
correction and punishment.

3 A child also of years and discretion, Exodus 35.2. Ezech. 20.20.21.
and a servant is bound on the Sabbath to cease from works of pleasure
altogether, and from works of profit also altogether, both in respect of his
own profit, or the profit of his parents, or governors: unless it be in a
case of present necessity coming by the immediate hand and providence of God;
for then the child or servant may work, the cautions before named being
observed.

Here added, Psalm. 92.2.
that the Sabbath contains twentie-foure hours as well as any other natural
day.

And that the Sabbath begins at midnight on Saturday, and ends at midnight
next following.

Reasons annexed to the fourth Commandment, persuading to the obedience of it,
are four.

1 From the Lords liberal allowance of six days for our own works and
businesses, Exodus 20.9.
that in equity we are bound to cease from our own works on the Sabbath,
because the Lord so largely imparteth six days of the seven to us, and
reserueth but one to himself.

2 From the Lords own right, that the seventh day is his day, Exodus 20.10.
and not ours, and that he has set it apart to himself and to his own
service.

3 From the Lords own example and practice, Exodus 20.11.
that he himself on the seventh day rested from his work of creation.

4 From the hope of blessing, that the Lord has set apart the Sabbath, Exodus
20.11.
not only as a day of service to himself, but also as a time and means of
blessing to all that carefully and conscionably observe it.

The end of the fourth Commandment.
The fifth Commandment. The affirmative part.
The fifth Commandment contains a precept,

Honor thy father and thy mother;

And a confirmation of it, by a promise made to such as yield obedience to it,
in these words,

That thy days may be long in the Land, which the Lord thy God gives thee.

The precept requires all due respect, and all due carriage of inferiors
toward their superiors; and by necessary consequence, of superiors also
toward their inferiors, and of equals among themselves; and that either in
general or particular.

First, in general, as of inferiors, toward their superiors, standing in two
things,

1 In yielding to them reverence.

2 In a care and endeavor to deserve well of them.

In yielding to them reverence, and that inward and outward:

1 Inward reverence, Leuit. 19.3. 1. Sam. 10.26. Romans 13.1.2. Ephesians. 6.5.
(namely) a reverent opinion and estimation of them; that they think and
esteem of them reverently in regard of Gods ordinance, in setting them over
them, and because they bear Gods image.

2 Outward reverence, 1. Sam. 1.15. Leuit. 19.32. Genesis 18.2. Mar. 10.17. Exodus
18.13. 1. King. 2.19.
(namely) a manifestation of their inward reverence, both by word and deed,
both by reverent speeches, and by reverent behavior; as by rising up before
them, by baring the head, by bowing the knee, and such like. In a care and
endeavor to deserve well of them, standing in yielding two things unto them: 1
Obedience. 2 Thankfulness.


1 Obedience, which is a willing submitting of themselves to their lawful
Commandments, 1. Pet. 2.13.14 Heb. 13.17. Pro. 15.5.
and counsels, and to their admonitions and reproves, and corrections.

2 In thankfulness, which is not only a thankful acknowledgement of their
goodness toward them in word; Genesis 4.7.25. 1 Timothy 5.4.17
but an endeavor also to requite them by doing good to them; again and that
two ways,

1 By yielding them their help in outward things, if they stand in need of it.
Romans 13.6.7. Galat. 6.6.

2. 1. Tim. 2.1.2.
By praying for them.

Secondly, of superiors toward their inferiors, standing

1 Either in yielding that which is due from them, to all that are any way
inferior unto them, in age, place or gifts. And the things that are due from
them to such inferiors, are,

1 To go before them in an holy conversation and good example, Job. 29.7.8.
Philip. 3.17. Tit. 2.7. 1. Pet. 5.3.
showing forth all gravity according to their place, by their countenances,
gestures, words and deeds.

2 In meekness of spirit, Deuteronomy. 17.20. 2. King. 5.13.14.
to yield to them in good things, respecting them as their brethren.

3 Keeping and maintaining their state and place: Job. 31.13. Romans 14.3.
to be afraid to wrong or despise the meanest or their inferiors.

2 Or in yielding that which is due from them toward such as are inferiors to
them, more especially in respect of place, and are under their power and
government; and the things that are due from them to such inferiors are.

1 To rule them in the Lord, and to endeavor that God may be honored by all
that are under their government. Deuteronomy. 17.19. 1. Sam. 2.30. 2. King. 23.1.2.3.


2 To seek their good, the good of their bodies, Romans 13.4. Isai 49.23. Number.
11.12. Genesis 19.18. Genesis 9.26.27. Heb. 11.20.
and the good of their souls, by providing good things for them, by protecting
and supporting them; by giving them good instructions, commandments and
counsels, by praying for them and blessing them, according to the power they
receive from God.

3 In wisdom and discretion, to use their authority over them, Psalm. 101.6.7.
Romans 13.3.4.
to the favoring, countenancing, and rewarding the good and such as do well;
and to the discountenancing and punishing the bad and evil doers, according to
their faults and offenses.

3 Thirdly, of Equals among themselves, standing in a modest preferring each
other before themselves, both in opinion and practice. Philip. 2.3.


In particular, according to the relation of certain persons, either of
superiority or of inferioritie: and that either in private, as in the family;
or in public, as in the Church or Commonwealth: of these severally.

Private in the family, which is,

1 Either natural between parents and children.

2 Or by calling and condition, as between the husband and the wife, or
between the master and the servant.

The due respect and due carriage of children toward their parents stands in
yielding to them, 1 Reverence. 2 Obedience. 3 Thankfulness.

Reverence: Inward both in heart and mind, reuerencing them by thinking and
esteeming reverently of them, Leuit. 19.3. Malac. 1.6. Heb. 12.9.
by loving them and fearing them, in regard of their authority over them, and
of Gods image which they bear as they be parents be they never so mean or
poor.

Outward, declaring their inward reverence of them, by their outward reverent
behavior toward them, both in their words and gestures.

Obedience, (namely) a willing and hearty yielding, so far as they are able,
to the voice and will of their parents:

Standing,

1 In a cheerful yielding so far as they are able, Genesis 24.15. Pro. 1.8.
Ephesians. 6.1. Coloss 3.20. 1. Sam. 2.25.
to these things which their parents teach or counsel or command, being things
honest and lawful, though never so base or painful.

2 In a quiet and patient suffering of that which their parents do inflict and
lay on them in word or deed, be it admonition, reproof, Pro. 13.1. Pro. 15.5.
Heb. 12.9.
or correction:

Expressed in two things,

1 In the choice of a fit and lawful calling, 1. Sam. 8.1. Mar. 6 3.
children are to be directed therein at the discretion of their parents.

2 In being ordered and disposed of by their parents in marriage. Deuteronomy. 7.3.
Ierem. 29.6.1. Cor. 7.38. Genesis 21.21. Genesis 24.3.4. Judge. 14.1.2.

Thankfulness standing,

1 In yielding a comfort to them by their honest and good carriage. Pro. 10.1.
and 15.20. Pro. 23.15.16 Genesis 47.12. Rut. 2.18.


2 In succouring and releeuing them in case of want.

3 In praying for them. 1. Tim. 1.2.

4 In comforting them as they are able in time of their sickness, and in
committing their bodies to the grave being dead, Genesis 48.1. Genesis 25.9. Genesis
35.29. Genesis 50.12.13
after an honest and seemly manner.

The due respect and due carriage of parents toward their children, Parents.
stands in bringing up their children, and in a wife disposing of them being
brought up.

And touching education, they are to be careful that their children may live;
expressing that care,

1 In yielding to them (according to their ability) such competent food and
clothing, Mat. 7.9.10. 1. Tim. 5.8.10
and other necessaries, as be fit for them, and agreeable to their age.

2 As God gives them ability, by diligence in their callings, and a careful
use of all good and lawful means, 1. King. 21.3. Pro. 19.14. 2. Cor. 12.14.
and a wise ordering of their expenses, in providing and laying up some thing
for the maintenance of their children in time to come; so as they pinch not
themselves in things necessary, nor neglect the doing of that good they are
bound to do, to the Church, Commonwealth or poor; and wisely ordering and
disposing of things provided for the good of their children, by

Disposing them by will, Genesis 25.5.6. Isai. 38.1. Number. 28.7.8.
or otherwise as shall be thought fit, in their life time.

And that children may live well, expressing that care,

1 In being careful that their children newly borne may with all convenient
speed and in due order be admitted into the true visible Church of God by
Baptism, Genesis 21.3.4. Luke 1.59.60.61. Luke 2.21.
and have fit names given to them.

2 Not only in teaching them civility and good manners, Deuteronomy. 4.10. Deuteronomy.
6.7.20.21. Deuteronomy. 11.19.
and in trayning them up in learning and humane knowledge, and humane affairs,
Pro. 22.6. Ephesians. 6.4. 2. Tim. 3.15.
but instructing them also in Religion, and endeavoring to sow the seeds of
godliness in their hearts, so soon as they are able to speak and come to the
use of reason and understanding, and endeavoring that as they grow in years,
so they may grow and increase in knowledge.

3 In checking and rebuking them when they do offend and do amiss, 1. King.
1.6. Pro. 13.24. Pro. 19.18. Pro. 23.13.14. Heb. 12.7 9.
and in words reproving them discreetly, if that will serve the turn; if not,
in giving them seasonable, due and moderate correction.

4 In praying for their good, Genesis 28.1. Genesis 48.15.16 1. Chron. 29.19. Job.
1.5. 2. Sam. 12.16.
and for the blessing of God on their bodies and on their souls.

In a wise disposing of them being brought up, standing,

1 In the choice of a fit and lawful calling, Genesis 4.2. Genesis 46.34. Genesis 47.3.
and course of life for them.

2 Knowing them to be marriageable, Genesis 21.21. Genesis 24 3.4. Genesis 28.1.2. Genesis
38.6. Ierem. 29.6. 1. Cor. 7.36. Pro. 31.30. Eccles 7.13.
and not to have the gift of continency, in using their best endeavor to
provide fit matches for them in time, or at least aduising them thereunto by
themselves or by their friends, and therein to have a special respect to
wisdom and piety.

The due respect and due carriage of the wife toward her husband, stands in
yielding to him subjection, loyalty, and faithful love, help and comfort.

1 Subjection (namely) an humble ready and willing yielding and submitting of
her self to the government of her husband, Genesis 3.16. Rom 7.2. Ephesians.
5.22.23.24. Coloss. 3.18.
standing in yielding to him reverence inward and outward, and obedience.

1 Inward reverence (namely) in carrying in her mind a reverent opinion and
estimation of him, Ephesians. 5.23. 1. Pet. 3.2.
thinking reverently of him, and carrying in her heart a reverent awe and fear
to offend him in any thing, acknowledging him as her head, though he be never
so poor or mean in the world.

2 Outward reverence, (namely) a manifestation of her inward reverence, Gen
18.12. 1. Pet. 3.6. 1. Tim. 2.6.10 11.12.
by outward meekness and lowliness, expressed in her speech; giving him
reverent titles and terms, and in her countenance, and in all her behavior
toward him.

Obedience, willingly yielding her self to be commanded, Genesis 12.5. Genesis 13.1.
Genesis 31.4. to 17. 2. King 4.22. 1. Pet. 3.6.
governed and directed by him in all things honest and lawful, though they be
never so cross and contrary to her own mind; according to her ability
doing what he gives in charge to be done, and forbearing to do that which he
forbids.

2 Loyalty, and faithful love, (namely) a constant keeping of the marriage
covenant made with him, Pro. 2.17. Pro. 31.12. Romans 7.2. Tit. 2.4.
and a constant yielding to him, all duties of love that concern her, so long
as they live together, with a desire to give him all holy contentment;
expressing that

1 In her chastity, being chaste and faithful to him both in her mind and body,
Pro. 31.11. Tit. 2.5. 1. Tim. 3.11.
and keeping her self to him only.

2 In her secrecy, keeping secret his honest intents, Pro. 11.13. Pro. 12.4.
Pro. 31.11.
sayings and doings, which he would not have discovered; and hiding and
covering his faults from all, saving those who may help to better him; and to
pray to God for his amendment.

3 Help and comfort, and that

1 In respect of his body, Genesis 2.18. 1. Cor. 11.9.
according to her ability using her best endeavor to preserve his body in
health; and if it be sick, to tender it and to look to it, with all
carfulness and diligence.

2 In respect of his outward estate, Genesis 27.9. Pro. 31.15.23. Eccles. 49.10.
(as much as concerns her in her place) helping him in the government of the
family, and as the Lord makes her able; being provident for his estate by
exercising her self in some profitable employment, 1. Tim. 5.14. Pro. 31.13.
to 29.
by appointing her maids their work, and ouerseeing them therein, and by
(...) ordering of her children and ser^ants, instructing them and admonishing
them as occasion is offered.

3 In respect of his soul, using her best endeavor to refresh his heart with
comfort in time of heaviness and sorrow, Job. 19.17. 2. King. 4 9.10 1. Tim.
2.12.
and to ^^ir him up, and to help him forward in good duties, and to join with
him in the performance of them, and to pray for the good of his body and the
good of his soul.

The due respect and due carriage of the husband toward his wife, Husbands
duty.
stands in a wise and right usage of his power and authority over his wife,
in tender love to her, and in giving honor to her.

1 In a wise and right usage of his power and authority over his wife, and
that, standing

1 In using it so as he maintain his pre-eminence and superiority in all
things, Genesis 3.16. Ephesians. 5.23. 1. Cor. 11.13.
carrying himself as head and governor over his wife.

2 In using it not as a tyrant over her after his own lust and pleasure, Pro.
2.17. Ephesians. 5.23. Genesis 2.22. 1. Pet. 3.7.
but so as may be for her good in all things, and so as his government be void
of rigor and bitterness, Coloss. 3.19.

In tender love to her, standing in cleaving to her as one with himself by the
bond of marriage, Genesis 2.24. Mat. 19.5.6.
in true love and affection of his heart, in special manner expressing that
love and affection to her, Mar. 10.7.8.
in love to her body, and in love to her soul.

In love to her body, expressing that,

1 In contenting himself with the love of his own wife only, Genesis 24.67. Pro.
5.19.20. Malac. 2.14.15
and keeping himself to her alone, both in his mind and body; manifesting
that,

By being willing to have his abode with her as much as may be, 1. Pet. 3.7.
Genesis 29.8.9. Isai. 62.5. Pro. 5.18.19.
and his calling will suffer him; and by living cheerfully with her, letting
her have all comfortable familiarity with him.

2 In regarding carefully the good of the body of his wife, 2. Sam. 12.3.
Ephesians. 5.28.29.
as he regards the good of his own body; manifesting that,

By providing as God makes him able, Genesis 30 30. Exodus 31.10. Pro. 27.27.
all things needful and fitting for her maintenance, according to his place
and calling, 1. Tim. 5.8. Genesis 28.16.
both for the time of his life, and after his death, if he die before her; and
ordering all things to the best, and by protecting her as much as he is able
from all injuries both at home and abroad.

2 In love to her soul, 1. Pet. 3.7. Ephesians. 5.25.26 27. 1. Cor. 7.16. Pro.
2.17.
dwelling with her as a man of knowledge, being careful, and using his best
endeavor in wisdom and discretion to do good to her soul; manifesting that,

1 In going before her in good example.

2 In using his best endeavor either to plant good things, 1. Cor. 14.35. 1.
Sam. 1.8. 2. Sam. 12.24. Genesis 25.2. Genesis 30.2.
or to increase them being already implanted in her soul, by teaching and
instructing her, by giving her good counsel, by encouraging and comforting
her, and by praying for her; and likewise in using his best endeavor to amend
and cure the things that are amiss in her, 2. Sam. 6.21. Job. 2.10.
and to reclaim her when she does offend in word or deed, the offense being
such as lies in his power to amend, by seasonable and loving admonition or
reproof, as occasion is offered.

In giving honor to her, standing,

1 In making account of her as his companion and yoake-fellow, Genesis 2.18.19.
Pro. 31.27. 1. Tim. 5.14.
and fellow helper, allowing her to help him in the government of the family;
and leaving her (she being able and faithful) in some household matters, to her
own will and to her own indgment and discretion; and maintayning her
authority and honor amongst children, servants, and others in the house.

2 In a wise and patient suffering and bearing with her natural infirmities,

The duty of servants. Servants.


The due respect and due carriage of servants toward their masters, stands
in yielding to them,

Reverence, subjection, faithfulness, and thankfulness.

1 Reverence, inward and outward.

1 Inward reverence, Malac. 1.6. Ephesians. 6.5.6.7 Coloss. 3.22.23.24. 1. Pet.
2.18.
(namely this) in thinking and esteeming reverently of them, and carrying in
their hearts a reverent awe and fear of them, discerning Gods Image in them,
and that they stand in Christ his stead unto them, in regard of their power and
authority over them as they be their masters, be they never so poor or mean
in the world.

2 Outward reverence (namely) a manifestation of their inward reverence, by
their reverent behavior toward them, 2. King. 5.13.25. Pro. 28.18. Act. 10.7.
both in word and deed; as by giving them reverent titles, by bowing to them,
rising up before them, vnbaring the head, and such like.

2 Subjection (namely) an humble, Tit. 2.9. 1. Pet. 2.18.
ready, and willing submitting of themselves to the exercise and practice of
that authority and power that their masters have over them, standing in
yielding obedience to the voice and will of their masters; Ephesians. 6.5. Coloss.
3.22.
and that standing,

1 In ready and cheerful yielding (so far as they are able) to those things
which their masters teach them, Genesis 24.2.3.4.9.10. 2. Sam. 7.8. Luke 7.8.
Luke. 17.7.8.9.
or counsel them, whether they be things that pertain to their honest and
lawful callings and be their ordinary works, or they be duties of piety and
religion: and a ready and cheerful doing as they are able, of things commanded
by their masters, being things fitting and honest and lawful, though they be
never so base, and never so laborious and painful.

2 In a meek and patient bearing of that check, Cen. 16.6.8.9. 1. Genesis 2.18.20
Tit. 2 9.
rebuke or correction that is laid on them by their masters, yea though the
correction be without just cause, or unreasonable, and more then it ought to be.

3 Faithfulness (namely) a yielding of sincere and single hearted service to
their masters, Coloss. 3.22.23. Tit. 2.10.
and doing their best endeavor in every thing, to answer that trust that their
masters do repose in them; expressing that,

1 In diligence and painfulness, Ephesians. 6.5.6. Col. 3.22.23. Gen 24.33. Genesis
31.40.
in being diligent in doing that business they are set about by their masters,
and doing it with the uttermost strength of their minds and bodies, or both,
according to the quality of the business, and that as well in the absence as
in the presence of their masters.

2 In trusty service, in a care of their masters good and profit and lawful
advantage at all times; Mat. 25.19. to 29. Tit. 2.10. Genesis 31.38.39 Genesis 39.6.7.
being as careful and thriftie for their masters and their families, as they
would be for themselves, and their own families.

3 In secrecy and care of their masters good name, 2. Sam. 16.3. 2. King.
6.11. Micah 7.5.6.
keeping secret their honest intents, sayings and doings, which they would not
have discovered; and as much as may be, hiding and covering their wants and
infirmities, and not blazing them abroad.

4 Thankfulness, (namely) not only an acknowledgment in word of their
masters care over them for their good, and of the good they receive from them,
their master being careful to do them good; but a care and endeavor also in
servants (so far as they are able) to answer that care of their masters and
that good they receive from them, by doing good to them again; standing,

1 In yielding comfort and in bringing credit to them, Genesis 39.8.9. Psalm.
101.6.7. Pro. 14.35.
by their honest and religious good behavior and carriage.

2 In praying for their masters, 1. Tim. 2 1. Genesis 24.12.
and for direction and good success in their business.

3 In praising God for their good gifts, 1. Tim. 2.12. Genesis 24.27.
and for their care they take with them for their good, and for the good
success they find in their works and businesses.

The due respect and due carriage of masters toward their servants stands
in two things: Masters.


1 In a wise and right usage and exercise of their power and authority over
their servants.

2 In being helpful unto them for their good.

1 A wise and right usage and exercise of their power and authority over their
servants, stands

1 In dealing justly with them.

2 In doing that which is equal and conscionable to them, Coloss. 4.1.
Coloss. 4.1.

In dealing justly with them, and that,

1 In requiring of them not only things lawful and possible, Leuit. 25.46.
Pro. 12.10.
but things also proportionable to their ability and strength.

2 In yielding to them meat, Deuteronomy. 24.14.15 Pro. 31.15. and 21. Mat. 10.10.
Leuit. 19.13. Iam. 5.4.
drink, and apparel, fitting for them in regard of their service, and in
regard of their order and degree, and their quality and condition in the
family; or competent wages to provide the same, being careful that they have
their meat and drink, and their whole wages in due season.

3 In yielding to them just censure and correction for their faults, Pro.
19.29. Pro. 29.19. Exodus 21.20.
not censuring or correcting them, without just cause or excessiuly, but wisely
and discreetly, admonishing, checking and rebuking them when they do amiss,
with words, if that will serve the turn; if not, giving them seasonable, due
and moderate correction.

2 In doing that which is equal and conscionable to them, and that

1 In yielding to them moderate rest from their labors, Exodus 23.12. Deuteronomy.
5.14. Pro. 12.10.
and lawful and seasonable recreation, without which they cannot continue with
any cheerfulness in their callings; and especially allowing them liberty to
sanctify the Sabbath both in public and private.

2 In being careful for their servants when they fall sick in their service,
Mat. 8.5.6. 1. Sam. 30.13.
providing according to their ability, things needful for them in time of
their sickness.

3 In yielding to them according to their ability, Deuteronomy. 15.13.14
some further recompense over and above their wages when they depart from them,
according to the good and faithful service they have done them, and according
to the time they have been with them.

2 In being helpefull to them for their good, and that in respect of their
calling and religion.

1 In respect of their calling, (namely) in seeing them follow the works of
their calling, Pro. 29.21. Exodus 35.34. Pro. 31.27.
ouer-seeing them in their works, and directing them in the doing of them, not
only so as may be for their own present good and lawful benefit, but so also
as may be for the good of their servants in time to come; teaching them wherein
they are unskillful and need teaching, especially in their trade and mystery,
faithfully opening that to them, and so as they may best and most easily learn
it.

2 In respect of religion, and that first in being careful that their servants
keep an holy rest to God on the Sabath, Exodus 20.10. Psalm. 42.4. Act. 10.24.33.
endeavoring to fit them for public exercises, and bringing them to the public
assemblies in due time, and looking that there they behave themselves
religiously the whole time; and after the public exercises are ended, taking
account of that which they have heard, that they may profit in knowledge and
holy obedience.

Secondly, Genesis 18.19. Deuteronomy. 6.7. Josh. 24.15. Ierem. 10.25.
in instructing them carefully and diligently in private, in the holy
Scriptures and in the grounds of religion, that they may grow in knowledge, and
may reap benefit by the public Ministry of the word; and in praying with
them and for them, that the Lord would bestow on them all needful graces.

The due respect and due carriage of the people or flock toward their
Minister or Pastor, The People or Flock.
stands in yielding to them, reverence, submission, assistance and
thankfulness.

1 Reverence, (namely) having him in reverent account and estimation, 1. King.
17.18. 2. King. 4.16. 1. Cor. 4.1. 2. Cor. 5.20. 1 Thessalonians. 2.13. Tit. 1.7.
esteeming of him reverently in their hearts, and expressing their reverent
estimation of him both in word and deed; and especially in hearing him teach
the truth of God with reverence, even as a messenger sent to them of God, and
as standing in Christ his stead, and as Gods steward and disposer of his
secrets to them, be he never so weak or poor.

2 Submission, willingly yielding themselves to be taught and guided by him,
Exodus 24.3.7. Ioh. 10.2.3.4.5.27. Heb. 13.17.
hearing and knowing his voice, and obeying his doctrine truly delivered to
them out of the word of God, and following him as the sheep of Christ in his
holy doctrine and conversation.

3 Assistance, and that two ways.

1 Assisting him by their power, and according to their ability, Ierem.
38.7.8.9. Romans 16.4. 2. Tim. 4.16.
standing for his defense against the wrongs and injuries that are offered and
done to him, by il disposed persons.

2 Assisting him by their prayers, praying for him that the Lord would give him
both ability and liberty to execute and fulfill his ministerial office; Romans
15.30.31. Ephesians. 6.19. Coloss. 4.3.4. 2 Thessalonians. 3.1.2. Philem. v. 22. Heb.
13.18.
and that he would give him strength, courage and power to stand against men
and devils, that seek by force and subtlety to discourage him, and either to
drive him away, or to hold him back from the faithful discharge of his duty.

4 Thankfulness not only acknowledging in word their Ministers care over
them, and his pains taken with them for their good, he being well qualified,
and being faithful and careful and taking pains with them as he ought for
their good; but a care and an endeavor also in the people, so far as they are
able, to answer that care and that pains of their Minister and the good they
do or may receive from him, by doing good to him again; that standing

1 In rejoicing in him, Isai. 52.7. Philip. 2.29.
and giving thanks to God for him, praising God for his good gifts, and for
his faithful care over them, and pains taken with them for their good.

2 In yielding him 1. Tim. 5.17.18. Deuteronomy. 19.12. Galat. 4.15. 1 Thessalonians.
5.12.13. 1. Cor. 9.7. to 15. Galat. 6.6. The Minister or Pastors duty. Ezech
13.17. Ezech. 33.7. Job 33.23.24. Act. 20.28.31. Heb. 13.17. 1. Pet. 5.2.
double honor, that is, both singular love for his works sake, and also
sufficient maintenance both in regard of his person and calling.

The due respect and due carriage of the Minister or Pastor toward his people
or flock, stands in watching carefully and faithfully over his people,
diligently ouerseeing them, and carefully endeavoring to do good to their
souls, both to gain and call them to God that are not called, and also to
preserve and keep them in Christ that are called; expressing that,

1 In using and applying his gifts for the best good of their souls.

2 In going wisely in and out before them, in using and applying his gifts for
the best good of their souls; and that

1 By diligent and faithful preaching the pure word of God to them, Ierem.
3.15. 1. Cor. 9.16. 2. Tim. 4.2.
in season and out of season, for the best good of their souls; and that

By opening to his people the will of God revealed in his word, Nehem. 8.8.
Ierem. 23.16.28. Ezech. 13.3. to 10.
faithfully and truly expounding that to them that they may understand it, and
delivering unto them sound and wholesome doctrine, 1. Cor. 2.4. Tit. 1.9. 2.
Tim. 2.15.
and that in plainness and power, to their capacity and conscience: and by
making right use and application of it to them, giving every one his portion as
need shall require and as just occasion is offered; Heb. 5.12. 2. Tim. 2.25. 2.
Tim. 4.2. Tit. 1.9.10.11.13. Act. 18.28.
instructing the ignorant, and endeavoring to build up his people further in
knowledge of the truth of God, refuting errors, that either the whole flock or
any of them are tainted withal, Isai 58.1. Tit. 2.1.6.15. Ierem. 23.14.17.
Ezech. 13.10.11.18.22. 1. Cor. 14.3.
or may fall into; exhorting and stirring them up to piety and all good
duties, admonishing them that are unruly, and wisely rebuking and reproving
them for their sins, and that with meekness or sharpness as occasion is
offered; strengthening the weak, and comforting such as stand in need of
comfort, and are justly to be comforted.

2 By a wise and right dispensing of the Sacraments to them, 1. Cor. 4.1.2.
Mat. 24.45. Pro. 27.23. Philip. 2.19. 1. Sam. 12.23. Philip. 1.9. Coloss.
1.3.9. 1 Thessalonians. 1.2. 1 Thessalonians. 3.13. 2 Thessalonians. 1.3.11
and also by praying for them, and praising God on their behalf, examining
them, how fit they be to partake in the holy things of God, and instructing
them, and endeavoring to make them fit to partake in them to their comfort, and
praying for their spiritual good, and praising God for the spiritual good
that is bestowed on them.

3 In going wisely in and out before them, Exodus 28.30. Philip. 4.9. 1. Tim.
4.12.
that is, going before them in all holy example and being a pattern of holy
life to them; and that,

Both in doing good things, Mat. 5.14.15.16. Tit. 2.7. 2. Tim. 2.3. 1. Tim.
3.4.5.7. 1. Cor. 9.19. to 25. Subjects.
and in the practice of every good work. And also in suffering.

The due respect and due carriage of the subjects toward their Magistrates,
stands in yielding to them reverence, submission, fidelity, and
thankfulness.

Reverence both inward and outward.

1 Inward reverence, (namely) thinking and esteeming reverently of them; Psalm.
82.1.6. Eccles. 10.20. Romans 13.17.
and carrying in their hearts a reverent awe and fear of them, acknowledging
Gods image in them, and that they have their authority from God, and are
ordained of God, and are his deputies, and stand in his stead as they be
Magistrates.

2 Outward reverence, 2. Sam. 15.21. Dan. 4.16. Act. 26.25. Jude epist. v. 8.
2. Sam. 9.6.8. 1. King. 2.23. 2. King. 3.14. Act. 24.10.
(namely) a declaration of their inward reverence, expressing their outward
reverent behavior toward them, both in word and deed, by giving them titles
of honor and reverence due to them, by bowing to them, by standing bare in
their presence, by keeping silence in Courts of judgment till they be called
to speak.

Submission, (namely) an humble ready and willing submitting of themselves to
the exercise and practice of that authority and power that their Magistrates
have over them, 1. Pet. 2.23.
Tit. 3.1.
standing in yielding obedience to them; expressing that

1 In yielding willingly and readily so far forth as they are able, Josh.
1.16.17. 1. Sam. 16.19.20.
to those things that their Magistrates do command, 2. Sam. 15.14.15. 1. King.
2.25. 2. King 10.25.
keeping and performing according to their ability, the express commandment
of their Magistrates, in all things honest and lawful.

2 In a quiet and patient bearing of the censures and punishments that their
Magistrates lay on them for their offenses in breaking their good and wholesome
laws, 2. Sam. 19.27.28. Pro. 24.21.22. Act. 25.11. Romans 13.4.
though it be to the loss of their lives.

3 Fidelity, (namely) a loyal and sound hearted love to them, 1. Sam. 22.14.
2. Sam. 20.2.
constantly cleaving to them, and not shrinking from them when they have need
of them, nor deceiving them at any time, nor in any thing wherein they ought to
be faithful.

Expressing that:

1 In a tender care of their honor and dignity, 1. Sam. 19.24.5.
endeavoring as much as they are able, within compass of their place and
calling, 2. Sam. 24.3.
to keep their Magistrates from doing any thing that may blemish them in their
place and office: Ierem. 36.25.
as being such as may speak to them, by speaking plainly unto them, yet
reverently and dutifully; and by dissuading them as much as they may, from that
which is amiss, when they see they are about to do any evil, and not
flattering and soothing them up in any evil course.

2 In standing as much as they are able for the defense of their life and
state, 2. Sam. 15.21. 2. Sam. 18.3. 2. Sam. 21.17.
especially in defending to their uttermost power the life of their Prince and
supreme Magistrate, though it be to the loss of their own lives.

3 In keeping secret their honest intents, sayings and doings, 2. King. 6.11.
2. Sam. 17.15.16. Hest, 2.21.22.
which they would not have discovered; and in discovering of treasons,
conspiracies, practices and dangers, intended against their lives and persons,
and especially against the life and person of their Prince and supreme
Magistrate.

3 Thankfulness, not only acknowledging in word, their care over them for
their good, and the benefits they enjoy under their wise and good government
(their Magistrates being careful as they ought to be for their good,) but a
care and an endeavor also in subjects so far as they are able, to answer that
care and good they do or may receive by their good government, by doing good to
them again.

And that,

1 In yielding to them outward help and support willingly and cheerfully, Mat.
22.21. Romans 13.6.7.
paying to them subsidies, taxes and other payments necessary for the
maintenance of their estate, especially the estate of the Prince, both in time
of peace and in time of war.

2 In praying for them, especially for their Prince and supreme Magistrate,
for his person, state, 1. King. 1.39. Ierem. 29 7. 1. Tim. 2.1.2.
and happy government.

3 In praising God for their good gifts, the right use of their authority,
Psalm. 21. 1. Tim. 2.1.2.
and the blessing of God on their public actions that concern the common
good, the good of their subjects, both in peace and in war.

The due respect and due carriage of the Magistrate toward his subjects,
Magistrates.
stands in a wise and right usage of his good gifts, and of his power and
authority over his subjects, Isai. 49.23. Romans 13.4. 2. Tim. 2.1.2.
in using and applying his gifts and authority in that place and office he
holds in the commonwealth, for the best good of his subjects and of the
common wealth; and that,

By a careful promoting and advancing of true religion and the pure worship of
God, 2. King. 18.4. 2. King. 13.3. to 21. 2. Chron 17.6 2. Chro. 34.31 1. Tim.
2.2.
and by discountenancing and defacing of all ungodliness, and all false and
idolatrous worship, according to his place and power: the chief Magistrate
according to his place and power, and the inferior Magistrate according to
his. As the chief Magistrate is to do it: Deuteronomy. 17.18.19 2. Sam. 6.14. 2.
Chron. 19.3


1 In his own person, (namely) by taking knowledge of true religion himself,
and by embracing it and practicing it in his own person.

2 In those that be under him: and that,

1 By making and establishing in his kingdom, 1. Chron. 23.
such good and wholesome laws and orders, as serve to maintain and uphold the
truth of religion, 2. Chron. 25.1. to 9. Judge 17.6.
and to inhibite and to put down all false religion, and to keep out of his
kingdom and dominion all confused mixture of religion, and by seeing those
laws and orders duly executed.

2 By providing as much as he may, 2. King. 9.1. 2. King. 22.14 Isai. 49.23. 2.
Chron 19.8 9. 2. Chron. 31.2.
that his subjects may be taught the truth of religion, and instructed in the
ways of God, to that end planting and maintaining schools of good learning
and Universities in his dominions; and looking that able and sufficient Pastors
be set over the several Churches in his kingdom.

3 By taking order that Pastors and teachers do their duty in preaching true
and sound doctrine, 2. King. 23.4. 2. Chron. 29.4 5.11.
and in other holy administrations; countenancing the good and faithful, and
discountenancing the careless and negligent; 1. King. 2.26.27.35. Exodus 22.20.
Leuit. 24.6.
and removing such as be erroneous and scandalous, and deserve to be removed;
and by taking order that the people yield themselves to be taught and guided by
their Pastors, for the good of their souls; and that heretics, idolaters, and
blasphemers, be punished according to their offenses.

The inferior Magistrate is to do it,

1 In his own person, by taking notice of true religion himself, Psalm.
2.10.11.12. Psalm. 148.11.
and by embracing it, and practicing it in his own person according to his
place and calling.

2 As much as he may, in all those that be under his power and authority; and
that,

1 By a diligent and careful ouerseeing of his under officers (he being one
that has officers under him,) and by looking to them that they perform their
duty in promoting true religion and the pure worship of God; Nehem. 13.10 11.
Nehem. 13.17 25 28.
and in discountenancing the contrary, so far as concerns them in their
places and offices, encouraging the good and faithful, and discountenancing,
reproving and censuring those that be careless and negligent, according to
their faults and offenses.

2 By executing duly and impartially those good laws and orders, Isai.
22.22.22. Ierem. 38.4.6. Mica. 3.2. Romans 13.3.4.
that are established for the maintenance of true religion and the pure worship
of God, to his uttermost power and so far as concerns him in his place and
office, to the countenancing of good causes of religion and religious persons,
whether Ministers or others; and to the discountenancing and repressing of bad
and wicked causes and persons, as heretics, idolaters, and such like.

2 By a careful providing for the peace and safety, Romans 13.4. 1. Tim. 2.2.
and quietness and outward welfare of his subjects, according to his place and
power; the chief Magistrate according to his place and power, the inferior
Magistrate according to his, as the chief Magistrate is to do it by using his
power.

1 For the establishing of peace and quietness amongst his subjects; and that,
Isai. 10 1.2.


1 By making such good and wholesome laws in his kingdom, as serve to settle
unity and concord, and equity and justice amongst his subjects, and by seeing
those laws duly executed, Psalm. 122.3.
that every one of his subjects may (as much as is possible) have his right,
and that which in equity and conscience belongs to him; and that none of them
be any way, in body, goods or name wronged or oppressed. Exodus 18.21.22. 2.
Sam. 8.15.16. etc. 2. Chron. 19.5.6.7.11.


2 By a wise and careful choice of his under governors, both in time of peace
and in time of war, that they be qualified as they ought to be, that they be
men of courage, fearing God, dealing truly, and hating covetousness. 1. King.
1.52. Pro. 16.14.15, Pro. 20.26. Romans 13.4.


3 By pulling down the wicked and enemies of peace, and by maintaining and
defending the quiet, and peaceable, and innocent, that seek to him for succor
and relief.

2 And for the keeping and maintaining of peace and quietness, and for the
preserving of the outward welfare of his subjects; and that,

1 By requiring only so much outward help and support from them as is meet
and necessary for the maintenance of his estate, 1. Sam. 8.11.12. etc. 1. King.
12.14.
either in time of peace or war, not oppressing them with exactions and
grieuances.

2 By making lawful leagues of friendship and peace with his neighbor Princes
and Governors. 1. King. 5.4.5.6.


3 By standing for the liberty of his kingdom and subjects if need be, Judge.
4.14. 2. Sam. 20.6.7 2. King. 18.7.8
by force of arms, by fighting for it, either for the defending of it against
the seditious and rebellious within his kingdom and dominions, or against the
common and foreign enemies of it, or for the recovering of it again being
lost.

The inferior Magistrate is to do it,

1 By a careful and diligent ouerseeing of his under officers (he being such a
one as has officers under him) looking to them that they perform the duty
that concerns them, Nehem. 5.1.2.3.4. etc.
touching the peace, and safety, and quietness, and outward welfare of men
where they have to do; that they deal justly, and truly, and equally between
man and man, and that they wrong no man in any cause or matter which they have
to deal withal: encouraging the good and faithful, and discountenancing,
reproving, and censuring such as be careless and faulty, according to their
offenses.

2 By acquainting himself with the good laws and customs of the land and
kingdom where he holds his office, Deuteronomy. 1.13.15. Number. 11.16. Act. 24.10.
and by being skillful in all those causes that shall come before him, that he
may wisely rule and govern all sorts of men that he has to deal withal, and
may wisely apply his knowledge to every particular occasion.

3 By admitting willingly all just complaints, and taking notice of all
aggreeuances that are brought before him, thoroughly examining them by all due
circumstances, 2. Sam. 15.3.4. Pro. 18.17. Leuit. 19.15. Deuteronomy. 1.16.17. Deuteronomy.
16.18.19. Judge. 19.30. 1. Sam. 8.3. Pro. 17.23. Isai. 1.23. Hos. 4.18. Josh.
7.24. Romans 13.4.
and having so examined them, by putting difference between good and bad
causes and persons, and deciding those causes so examined, incorruptly, giving
just judgment without partiality or respect of persons, and without receiving
of bribes and gifts to pervert judgment.

4 By seeing or taking order, that due and seasonable execution be done on
offenders and malefactors, according to the judgment and sentence passed on
them, Josh. 7.24. Romans 13.4.

3 By a careful procuring of civil honesty, good manners, and good order
amongst his subjects, according to his place and power; the chief Magistrate
according to his place and power, 1. Tim. 2.2.
and the inferior Magistrate according unto his, as the chief Magistrate is
to do it, thus:

By making such good laws and orders in his kingdom, Romans 12.17. Philip. 4.8.
Eccles. 5.8.
as serve to maintain civil honesty, good manners, and good order among his
subjects; and to inhibite and to put down all things that are thereunto
contrary, and by seeing those laws and orders duly executed, looking to it as
much as is possible, that his subjects walk orderly, being every one employed
according to his ability in some honest and lawful calling; and that al lewd
persons and practices, and all occasions of lust and vnthirftinesse be removed,
as stews, houses of filthiness, 1. King. 15.12
houses of gaming, and such like.

The inferior Magistrate is to do it,

By executing duly and impartially, both by himself, and by such as be in
office under him, the good laws and orders made for the maintaining of civil
honesty, and for the inhibiting and putting down of those things that are
thereunto contrary: standing

1 In setting such poor persons as be lusty and strong, to work, and not
suffering them to be idle, and to make begging and wandering their trade of
life; but punishing them according to law, if they be found rouing and
wandering: 2 Thessalonians. 3.10.11.12. Job. 30.5.6.7.8.
and in seeing that no maintenance or allowance be given to such without
punishment, unless they will settle themselves to some honest labor and
employment.

2 In taking order that such poor persons as be aged or weak, Deuteronomy 15.7.8.9
10.11.12. Job. 20.13.14.15.16.
or be blind or lame, and not able to labor; or such as have strength of
body, and use it carefully and conscionably, and yet cannot earne so much as to
maintain themselves and their families, be in some competent sort helped and
relieved, that they be not constrained to beg their bread.

3 In seeing, Leuit. 18.24.25.27.28. Deuteronomy. 23.17. 1. Sam. 2.22.
as much as possibly he may, all lewd practices, and all occasions of
filthiness and unthriftiness be removed, as stews, houses of filthiness,
houses of gaming, etc.

The due respect and due carriage of persons younger in years, Persons younger
in years.
toward those that are more ancient in regard of their years, stands in
yielding to them

1 Reverence both in heart, word, Leuit. 19.32. Job. 30.1. Isai. 3.5.
and deed, esteeming reverently of them in regard of their age, as a print of
Gods eternity, and showing forth their reverent opinion of them, 1. Tim. 5.1.2.
by giving them titles of reverence due to them in their place, and by giving
them the upper hand, by bowing to them, by rising up before them, and the like.

2 Modest behavior toward them, Job. 32.4.6.10 16.17. Tit. 2.6. 1. Pet. 5.5.
Persons more Ancient.
not presuming to speak before them in matters of weight, but keeping silence
till they have spoken.

The due respect and due carriage of persons more ancient toward those that
are younger in years, stands in yielding to them,

1 Good advice, Job. 32.7.9. 1. King. 12.6.7.8. Tit. 2.4.
counsel and direction as occasion is offered, wisely aduising, counselling
and directing them in good things.

2 Good example, giving them good example, Pro. 16.31. Isai 62.20. Tit. 2.2.3.
and going before them in a wise, sober, grave and holy conversation.

The due respect and due carriage of those that want good gifts, Those that
want gifts.
or are inferior to others in gifts, toward those that have good gifts,
stands in yielding to them,

1 An acknowledgement of their good gifts, Genesis 41.38.39 Dan. 4.6. Mat 3.11. 2.
Pet. 3.15.
and a reverent regard of them for the same, according to the measure of their
good gifts, and according to the excellency and kind of them; more reverently
respecting those that have good gifts of mind and graces of Gods Spirit, then
those that have only good gifts of body, or outward good gifts, though they
are also to be respected in regard of those good gifts.

2 Imitation of their good gifts, and making a good use of them to themselves,
1. Sam. 9.9. Ioh. 4.19.20. to 27. Philip. 4.9.
imitating the virtues and graces that are in others, and laboring for them in
themselves.

The due respect and due carriage of those that have good gifts of mind or
body, Those that have good gifts.
or outward good gifts, toward those that want those good gifts, or are
inferior to them in gifts, stands

In using those good gifts to the glory of God, Romans 14 7. Romans 15.1. 1. Cor.
12.7.
and to the greatest good of those that want them; not lifting up themselves
above their brethren, but bending down, and applying their gifts for the best
good of others.

The due respect and due carriage of those that do or may receive benefit from
others, toward those that have care, or show forth their care for their good
and benefit, stands

In a kind acceptance of the least benefit, Genesis 40.23. 2. Chron. 24.21.22.
Act. 22.3. Romans 16 2.3.4
and a thankful acknowledgment of it, and a loving remembrance of them for
it, as any occasion is offered, and in using it to Gods glory, and their own
best good.

The due respect and due carriage of those that have care of others, or show
forth their care for the benefit of others, toward those that do or may
receive benefit from them, stands

In taking the best and wisest course that possibly they can, 2 King. 2.9. Job.
29.16. Act. 22.3.
that the benefit they intend or reach out to others, may be most profitable
to them that are or shall be partakers of it.

The negative part of the fifth Commandment.
It forbids,

1 The want or neglect of the due respect and of the due carriage of inferiors
toward their superiors, and by consequent, of superiors toward their
inferiors, and of equals amongst themselves, and so the omission of any of
those duties that are required of inferiors, superiors, or equals, one
toward another, whether general, or particular.

2 Whatsoever is contrary to the due respect and due carriage of inferiors
toward their superiors, and of equals among themselves, and does diminish or
impeach the dignity that God has bestowed on others; as

1 The things contrary to the due respect and due carriage of inferiors
toward their superiors, are

1 A light and base esteeming, a despising and contemning of superiors, Leuit.
20.9. Deuteronomy. 27.16. Gen 9.22. Pro. 30.11.17. Iud. epist v. 8. Exodus 22.28.
Eccles. 10.20.
as the Anabaptists do in their judgment and opinion, showing forth that light
estimation and that contempt of them, by contemptuous words, gestures, or
deeds; as by wishing ill to them, by mocking and scorning of them, by speaking
ill of them, and reuiling them, by smiting them, and the like.

2 Disobedience to them, Deuteronomy. 21.18. Romans 1.30.
stubbornly refusing to yield that obedience they owe unto them; showing it
forth

1 In resisting their lawful authority, Genesis 28.8.9. 2 Samuel 15.10.11.12. Mat.
21.30. Tit. 2.15.
refusing to be governed by them, and in contemning their good counsels, and
their just and lawful commandments.

2 In resisting them, when they exercise their power over them, Genesis 16.8.9.
Deuteronomy. 21.18. Pro. 13.1. Tit. 2.9.
in admonishing, in reproving, or in correcting them, then murmuring or rising
up against them, or flying from them.

2 The things contrary to the due respect and due carriage of superiors
toward their inferiors are,

1 A light, vain, wicked and unseemly carriage of themselves in 2. Sam. 6.20.
the sight of their inferiors; Zephan. 3.4. Romans 2.17.18 to. 25.
when they carry themselves lightly, vainly, and wickedly, and unbeseeming
them in respect of their age, place, or gifts, before their inferiors, and
thereby not only bring dishonor to God, in whose place and room they stand
as they be superiors; Tit. 2.15.
but bring also just disgrace and contempt on their own persons, or on their
places or gifts.

2 The abuse of that authority and power that God has put into their hands
over their inferiors, Pro. 28 15. Z^phan. 3 3. Coloss. 3.19. 1. Pet. 5.3.
when they pervert that authority and power God has given them for the good
of those over whom they are set, to the hurt and wrong of those that be under
them; and that,

1 When they exercise it to the favoring, 1 King. 12.31. 2. Chron. 13.9
countenancing, and advancing of the wicked and unworthy; and to the
discountenancing, Eccle. 10.5 6.7 Mica. 3.2. Ierem. 5.23. Ezech. 13.18.21.
disgracing, and putting down and keeping under of the godly and well deserving.

2 When they exercise it either with too much lenity, or with too much
severity, 1. Sam. 2.22.23. Ephesians. 6.4.9. Coloss. 3.21.

3. The contrary to the due respect and due carriage of equals among
themselves, is,

The advancing and preferring of themselves one above another, Mat 20.24. Mat.
23.6.
either in opinion or practice, and so disdaining one another.

That inferiors, superiors, or equals, do things contrary to the due respect
and due carriage that they owe one to another, Pride. Pro. 13.10. Number. 12.1.2.
Ich. 19.10. Self-love. 2. Tim. 3.2.3.4. Carelessness.
proceeds either out of pride and arrogance, or self-love, or carelessness to
know their duty, or knowing it, to practice it; or curiosity, men busying
themselves with the duties of others, Zach 11.16. Curiosity. 1. Tim. 5.13. 1.
Pet. 4.15.
and meddling with things not appertaining to them.

The confirmation or promise.

It contains,

2 A confirmation of it by a promise made to such as yield obedience to it, in
these words,

That thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God gives thee.

The blessing promised is length of days, Ephesians 6.3. Deuteronomy. 5.16.
long life, and prosperity, and whatsoever belongs to a man's welfare and well
being in this life.

This blessing is promised rather then any other particular blessing, because
parents are the instruments and means of this life; therefore it pleases the
Lord to make this promise, and to give them long life for ablessing, who
dutifully, and respectively behave themselves toward their parents.

And long life in this world is a blessing, Eccles. 9.4.5.6.10. Psalm. 6.5.6.
because our temporary life is given us, that in it we may use all good means
to attain to life and salvation, and it is the time of repentance, and the
time of grace and salvation.

The land spoken of in this promise, is, in respect of the Israelites, the land
of Canaan, which was given of the Lord for a possession; but in respect of us
it is to be understood generally of any place, wheresoever we be in the world,
that such as honor their parents they have right of dwelling in that place
where they be, from the Lord, Psalm. 24.1. Ephesians. 6.3.
whose is the whole earth.

Things to be gathered from this promise, are,

1 That due respect and due carriage of inferiors, superiors, and equals one
toward another, is greatly pleasing to God. Coloss. 3.10.


2 That the best course that parents can take, 2. Sam. 13.14.28.29. 2. Sam. 15.
that it may go well with their children, is to instruct and nurture them in
godliness, and to bring them up in the fear of the Lord; and that they that
are careless and neglect this duty, do, as much as in them is, shorten the
days of their children,

3 That long life in this world comes not by nature or good constitution of
the body, Psalm. 31.15. Eccles. 8.8.
but of the good pleasure and providence of God, the Lord granting it, and
blessing the means to that purpose.

The end of the fifth Commandment.
The sixth Commandment. The negative part.
It forbids every thing that tends to the hurt or hinderance of the life of
man, either the life of his body, or the life of his soul.

The things hurting or hindering the life of the body of man, are either things
of practice, or things of omission.

Things of practice; and those are either inward in the heart, or outward in
word or deed.

Things inward in the heart, and those are four especially:

First, hasty, rash, unadvised, unjust, Mat. 5.22. Eccles. 7.11. Number. 24.10.
and sinful anger, (namely) such as is either hastily conceived, without just
and sufficient cause; or the cause being just and weighty, such as is directed
amiss^, as either against the person, 1. Sam. 17.28. Ephesians 4.26. Genesis 49.6.7.
Dan. 3.19.
or against the offense only as it is an offense to men, as an injury and
wrong, bringing hurt and damage to men, and not as an ofence to God; or such
as exceeds either in time or in measure, and becomes hot fiery anger,
furious and raging, troubling the mind, and making a man forget duty to God
and men.

Secondly, malice or hatred, which is old anger, Genesis 45.8. Leuit. 19.17. 1.
Ioh. 2.9.11. 1. Ioh. 3.15.
or continued wrath, and is anger or wrath kept close in the heart, cloaked and
covered for a time, with purpose to do hurt, and waiting for opportunity to do
mischief.

And the highest degree of it is such a malicious affection as is implacable,
^. Sam. 24 17.^8.19.20. ^ Sam. 26.21. ^^al. 120.6.7.
and can never be appeased, but is fully set at all times, and by all means to
do mischief. And

The worst kind of it is, Romans 1.30. 1. Ioh. 3.12. Mat. 10.22. 1. King 22.8
Ioh. 7.7.
when men malice or hate others, either, for the good things they see in them,
or for telling them of their faults, though they pretend other causes of their
hatred.

Thirdly, envy, whereby men grieve and repine at the good things that others
have, Ioh. 8.4.44. Genesis 30.1. Number. 11.28.29. Mat. 27.18.
which they would have and cannot, whether they be good things of the mind or
body, or outward good things; and do hate them for those good things: for envy
is a compound of carnal grief and hatred, and it comes

Out of pride and abundance of self-love. Galat. 5.2.6. 1. Tim. 6.4. 1. Cor.
13.4. Pro. 17.5. Pro. 24.17.18.


And it carries an envious person both to a wishing of evil and hurt to
another, and the fall of another; or to a rejoicing in the hurt, and evil, and
fall that comes to another.

Fourthly, a desire of revenge, which is, Leuit 19.19. Luke 9.54.55
when men to satisfy their own corrupt and troubled minds, for wrong done,
or supposed to be done to them, desire to requite evil for evil, and to right
themselves by extremity and by punishment in full proportion, according to
their reuengefull minds.

Outward things in word, and those are five especially:

First, bitter and cursed speaking, hard, Pro. 12.18. Mat. 5.22. Romans 3.14. 1.
Cor. 6.10. Ephesians. 4.31. Coloss. 3.8. 2. King. 19 4. Act. 24.14. Mat. 5.11.
spiteful, venomous, and provoking terms, brauling, railing, and reproachful
terms: and the worst kind of railing and reuiling, is, when men either rail
and speak evil of religion it self, or do rail and revile religious
persons, because they are religious and fearing God.

Secondly, 1. Pet. 4.14. Judge. 8.1.2.3. Pro. 15.1.
wrangling and contentious speech between parties, disagreeing either in
matters of religion, or about worldly affairs. Philip. 2.14.


Thirdly, Ephe. 4.31.
crying and unseemly lifting up of the voice, when men or women, being at
variance, in private speeches do, through choler and malice, lift up their
voices and speak so loud that they may be heard afar off.

Fourthly, threatening speeches, when as men or women from an inward dislike and
rage in their own private cause, Psalm. 94.4. Act. 9.1.
do give out threatening words against others.

Fifthly, mocking, scoffing and deriding speech, 2. King. 2.23. Ioh. 19.2. Act.
2.13. 2. Sam. 6.20. Ephesians. 5.4.
when men or women out of hatred and contempt of others, do either in plain
terms mock and deride them, or do gird and taunt them, and jest on them by
privy and close nips, thereby seeking to disgrace them, and to make themselves
and others merry by grieuing of them; and the

Worst kind of it is, when men mock and scoff, Genesis 21.9. Galat. 4.29. 2.
Chro. 39.16 Psalm. 69.11.12. Psalm. 119.51. Heb. 11 36.
and taunt others for well doing, and for refrayning from evil, for their
piety and religion, and for the virtues and graces that God has given them.

Outward things in deed, and those are either in countenance, or in some
gesture and carriage of the body, and some part of the body; or they be other
acts and deeds. Outward things in deed, in countenance and in some gesture and
carriage of the body, as (namely) all signs and gestures of the body, that
express rash anger, contempt and despite of heart toward another, Genesis 4.5.
Genesis 31.2.5. 1. Sam. 25 17. Mat 9.24. Mat. 27.39.
or others: as lowting, casting down of the countenance, disdainful, froward
and churlish behavior, nodding or shaking the head in contempt, snuffing,
tushing, geering, girning, flinging away in a chafe.

Other acts and deeds, and those are such as either hurt or hinder a man's own
life, or the life of another or others.

Such as hurt and hinder a man's own life, are either

Present means of taking away of a man's own life, Ephesians. 5.29.
and of self murder, (namely) such as do presently bereave a man of his life,
as when a man lays violent hands on himself by hanging, drowning, cutting his
throat, and such like: either

Out of horror of conscience, Mat. 27.4.5. 1. Sam. 31.4. 2. Sam. 17.23.
and despair of Gods mercy: or out of fear of worldly punishment or shame.

Or out of monstrous pride, or lingering means of the taking away of a man's
own life, and of self murder, (namely) such evil things as fret and weaken
the body, and impair the health of it by degrees: and those are four
especially.

First, Pro. 23.29.30 Isai. 5.11. Hozea. 7.5.
intemperancie in diet, surfeiting and drunkenness, riot and excess in eating
and drinking.

Secondly, idleness and unchastity, and intemperate abusing of the body by
whoredom and uncleanness, Pro. 20.4. Pro. 21.25. Pro. 2.18 19. 1. Cor. 6.18.
whereby men or women bring grievous and foul diseases on their bodies.

Thirdly, 2. King. 20.7. 1. Tim. 5.23.
a careless neglect or wilful refusing of the good means and helps that
serve to preserve the life of the body, as wholesome diet, clothing, physic,
especially in time of sickness.

Fourthly, a voluntary rushing into danger, either certain and unavoidable,
or very likely, without any just calling from God; Mat. 4.6.7.
as when men rush into houses infected with the plague.

Such things as hurt or hinder the life of another, or others, one or more; and
those are either proper only to public persons, whether Magistrates or
governors in the family; or common both to public and private persons.

The things proper only to public persons, whether Magistrates or governors
in the family; and those are four especially:

1 Any wicked and unjust law, Exodus 1.15.16.22. Dan. 3.4.5.6. Dan. 6.6.7.8.
Mat. 2.16.
statute, ordinance, edict, charge or command, made or given by public persons
and governors, tyrannously, to entrap or to destroy others.

2 The giving of unjust and wrong judgment, Amos 2.6. and 6.12. 1. King. 21.11
12.13. Pro. 17.15.26. Luke 23.24.25.
and the awarding of sentence in causes judicial, contrary to right and
equity, either to the condemning of the innocent, or to the justifying and
delivering of the guilty and evil doer.

3 The inflicting of unjust and undue punishment on others, 1. Sam.
22.17.18.19. Act. 12.2. Iam. 5.6. Gen 16.6. Leuit. 25.43. Deuteronomy. 25.2.3.
as by punishing the innocent and such as have not offended, or by exercising
tyrannous cruelty and extremity in punishing and correcting them that do
offend.

By cruel oppressing of others that be under them, Genesis 10.8.9. Ierem.
22.13.17. Micah. 3.1.2.3. Zephan. 3.3. Iam. 5 3.
by laying too heavy burdens on them, by getting what they can from them for
their own private gain, by using their labors for little or no wages.

The things common both to public and private persons: and those are either
such as tend to the hurt of the body of another or others, and yet for the
present take not away the life; or such as do hurt the body, and take away the
life of another or others.

Such things as tend to the hurt of the body of another or others, and yet for
the present taken not away the life, are five especially:

1 Hard and cruel dealing with others, 1 King. 21.15.16. Pro. 11.26. Isai.
5.8. Amos. 8.4.5.6. 1. These. 4.6. 1. Cor. 6.8.10. Iam. 2.6. Exodus 22.21.22.
Deuteronomy. 24.14.17. Ierem. 22.3. Zachar. 7.10. 2. King. 9.14.15. 2. King. 21.23.24.
Ier. 11.19.21. Ier. 18.18. Pro. 1.11. Act. 23.12.13. Iud. epist. v. 9. etc. 1.
Sam. 18.25. Mat. 26.48. Act. 7.52. Mat. 10.21. Luke 21.16.
oppressing and wringing them, either by incroaching on them by violent
extortion, or by fraud and circumuention in bargaining, or by troubling them
with unjust and undue courses in law: and the

Worst kind of oppressing and wringing others, is, when men oppress and wring
impotent, feeble, poor persons, strangers, fatherless, orphans or widows.

2 The combining with others and conspiring with them, and lying in wait for
the killing, or for the mischicuing of another or others.

3 The betraying of another or others into the hands of those that unjustly
seek his or their life and overthrow, especially the betraying of the Prince
and chief magistrate, or of those to whom men are bound by some near and
special bond.

4 The procuring and stirring up of such means and instruments, 2. Sam.
17.1.2.3. 2. Sam. 11.14.15. 2. Sam. 12.9. 2. Sam. 2.14.15.16.
as may take away the life of another or others, by counsel, by enticement, by
writing, by hiring some to lie in wait to kill them; by stirring them up
either for pleasure, or cruelty, to quarrel or fight one with another.

5 Unjust violence with the hand in striking, Exodus 2.13. Exodus 21.15. Leuit.
24.19. Deuteronomy. 27.29. Mat. 26 67. Act. ^3.2. 2. Cor. 11.24.25.
beating, wounding, or mayming of another or others; especially in striking,
beating, wounding or mayming of parents or superiors.

Or such things as do hurt the body and take away the life of another or
others: and those are, either

Such acts and deeds as by manifest violence shed the blood, and take away the
life of another or others; as namely such acts and deeds, whereby men do openly
and willingly take away the life of another or others, by sword, dagger, knife,
Genesis 4 8. 2 Samuel 3.27. 2. Sam. 4.6.7. Mat. 14.10.
rope, or gunne, or any like instrument and means whatsoever: and this sin
is more vile and odious when it is committed

Without regard of place, calling, 1. Sam. 24.7.14. 1. Sam. 26.9.10.11. 1.
King. 16.7.9. 2. Chro. 24.21 1 Thessalonians. 2.15. Mat. 2.16.
and condition; as when a man openly and willingly, by sword, dagger, knife,
rope, gunne, and such like instrument, sheds the blood, and takes away the life
of his Prince, or other Magistrate over him, of his Pastor, or of his master
etc. especially when they are executing their office; or of an infant that
cannot resist him: 1. Pet. 3.6.
or when a wife openly and willingly, by sword, dagger, knife, rope, gun, or
any like instrument and means whatsoever, sheds the blood, and takes away the
life of her husband; or the husband by such instruments and means does take
away the life of his wife.

Without regard of nature, Genesis 4.8. Judge. 9.5. 2. King. 3.27. 1. Tim. 3.9.
as when a brother openly and willingly, by sword, or other instruments and
means whatsoever, sheds the blood and takes away the life of his brother or
sister; the father the life of the child, and especially the child the life
of the father or mother.

Without regard of number and multitude, 1. Sam. 22.18.19. 2. King. 10.7. Act.
12.2.3. Genesis 34.25 and 49.5.6.7.
as when it is done on many, by adding murder to murder; though they be
strangers.

And this sin is committed, either

With deliberation, Deuteronomy. 19.11.12. Genesis 4.5.8. 2. Sam. 3.27. 2. Sam. 20.9.10.
as when men do it out of hatred and for desire of revenge, and out of grudge
carried in their hearts long before.

Or on a sudden, without deliberation, as when they do it being thereunto
carried, Genesis 4.23. Number. 25.16.17.18.24.25. 1. Sam. 20.30.33. 2. Sam. 2.22.23.
either by sadden passion of anger, without all former malice, and they do it
in their heat, rage and fury; or they do it in time of some vile and sinful
distemper, as in time of drunkenness etc.

Or such acts and deeds, as by some secret and cunning device, do shed the
blood, and take away the life of another or others; as namely, such acts and
deeds whereby men do willingly, yet under hand, and by means not presently
discerned, shed the blood, and take away the life of another or others; which
is done four ways:

1 By poisoning another or others, wittingly and willingly, Psalm. 69.21. Mar.
36.18. Exodus 22.18. Revel. 9.21.
and by poison killing them and bereauing them of their lives.

2 By witchcraft, and by enchantment and sorcery, as when men either use the
help of witches, sorcerers and enchanters, and by their help do kill another
or others. Or when witches, enchanters and sorcerers, do of the own accord by
the help of the devil, kill another or others.

3 By some subtle and crafty practice with others, 1. King. 21.19. 2. Sam.
12.9. Act. 2.23.
thereby causing them to shed the blood of another or others.

4 By conueying something into the body of a woman with child, Exodus 21.22.
purposely to destroy it, and thereby destroying the child, and causing an
untimely birth.

Things of omission, and those are two especially:

The one inward in the heart, the other outward.

The thing of omission inward in the heart, Romans 1.30. Romans 12.15.
namely, the want of pity and feeling compassion toward such as are in any
known misery and distress of body, Coloss. 3.12. Heb. 13.3. 1. Ioh. 3.17.
and are to be pitied; and men show themselves most wanting in pity toward
such as are in any known misery and distress of body, and are to be pitied:
when

They insult over them, and make themselves merry with their misery, Psalm.
69.26. Job. 19.21.22. Job. 24.9.10.
and so add to their distress and misery.

The outward thing of omission, Pro. 21.13. Isai. 58.7. Job. 31.16.17 to 21.
namely, the omitting of the works of mercy, that ought to be performed to
such as are in any known distress of body; when men being able, and having
power and means, do omit or refuse to yield help to them, whom they ought to
help, being any way distressed in body, and known to them to stand in need of
their help in respect of the body: and that is done two ways,

1 When men do not that good to their distressed bodies that they ought, Luke.
16.21. Mat. 25.41.42 43. Luke. 10.30.31.32. Iam. 2.15.16. 1. Sam. 20.34. etc.
1. King. 18.4. Pro. 24.11.12.
according to their need, and according to their own ability.

2 When they do not turn away that evil and that hurt from their bodies that
they ought, being able to turn it away, either by their speech, or by their
hands and power any way.

And the want of pity toward such as are to be pitied, 1. Sam. 30.11.12.13.
Job. 19.13.14. to 22. Romans 12.20. Galat. 6.10.
being in any known distress of body, or the omitting of the works of mercy,
that ought to be performed to such as are in any known distress of body, is
most vile and odious.

When men either want pity, or being able to yield help, do omit the works
of mercy to such as they are bound unto by some near and special bond of
place, calling or condition, or of nature, or grace.

The things hurting or hindering the life of the soul of man, are either,

Things that hurt and hinder the life of a man's own soul, or the life of the
soul of another or others, one or more.

The things that hurt or hinder the life of a man's own soul, are two
especially: Pro. 6.32. and 8.35. Ezec. 18.4.14 Romans 2.5. Tit. 3.11.


1 His sin against God, and especially his living and continuing in any
known sin, wilfully and obstinately.

2 His careless neglecting or wilful rejecting, Zach. 7.11.12. Heb. 2.3.
Reue^. 3.1.
of the means that God has ordained to salvation, and for the beginning and
continuance of spiritual life in the soul; as the word preached or read,
Sacracraments, prayer, and such like. And this is done three ways:

2 By not hearing the word preached ordinarily, Pro. 1.24. Pro. 28.9. Isai.
66.4. Ierem 7.13. Act 13.46. 1. Cor. 11.26.
and by not reading the word of God and other good books, and by not using the
Sacraments, prayer, and other holy ordinances of God, when men may and ought to
use them.

2 By not yielding to the word of God truly and faithfully preached to men, 2.
King. 17.13.14. Ierem. 25.4.5.6.7. Ier. 44.16.17. Ezech. 33.31. Act. 7.31. Act.
18.6. Ioh. 3.19. 2 Thessalonians. 2.10.11. 2. Tim. 4.3.4. 2. Pet. 3.16.
and by resisting and withstanding the Spirit of God in the ministry of his
messengers sent unto them.

3 By giving heed to fables and fancies, and not to the truth of the word of
God in love to it; and by corrupting, and perverting, the word of God.

The things that hurt or hinder the life of the soul of another or others, one
or more, are these; either

Things common to all persons being of years and discretion, or proper to
superiors, especially to Ministers.

Things common to all persons being of years and discretion, are either

Such things by which men hinder another or others, in the way of spiritual
life and salvation.

Or such things by which men cause the fall or the damnation of another or
others.

Such things by which men hinder another or others, in the way of spiritual
life and salvation are two.

By giving just offense to another or others by word or deed; Mat. 16.23. Mat.
18.6.7.
which is done two ways,

1 By leading an open wicked, sinful and scandalous life, which gives the
greatest offense, Exodus 34.12. 2. Sam. 12.14. Pro. 29.12.
and does the most hurt, when it is either to the just offense of many:

Or when a man that is of special note for place, 1. Cor. 5.2. 1. Sam. 2.17.
2. Sam. 12.14.
calling, or for the profession of religion, lives wickedly, and scandalously.

2 By abusing of Christian liberty, in things indifferent, Mat. 17.27. Romans
14.21. 1. Cor. 8.9.10. etc. 1. Co. 10.28.29.
as when men use things indifferent, unseasonably, not in fit time and place,
and before fit persons.

3 By daunting and discouraging another or others from a good and holy way,
Pro. 12.18. Ezech. 13.22.
and from going on in the way of true holiness.

Such things by which men cause the fall or damnation of another or others, are
four especially:

1 By provoking another or others any way to sin, Genesis 3.4. Ioh. 8.44. Number.
31.16. 2. Sam. 16.21. Pro. 1.10. to 14 Is^. 56.12. Mat 27.20. Job. 8.20. 2.
King. 3.14. Ier. 22.14.17. Ezech. 13.22.
as by bad counsel, by persuasion, or any other way by word or deed.

2 By encouraging and heartening another or others in sin, as by praising
them, or countenancing them when they do evil.

3 By consenting to another or others, Psalm. 50.18. Pro. 29.24. Isai. 1.23.
and by partaking with another or others any way in sin and in doing of evil.

4 By sowing dissentions among men, Pro. 6.19. Pro. 10.12. Leuit. 19.16. Pro.
11.13. Pro. 25.9.10. Pro. 26.20. Ezech. 22.9.
and by stirring up contentions, brawles, and quarrels, between parties,
especially between such as by the bond of nature or grace, or any other near
bond, are joined together; and this is done especially by carrying of tales
between parties; and by disclosing both the secret intents, and the faults of
the one to the other.

Things proper to superiors and especially to Ministers, are either things of
omission, or things of practice.

Things of omission, and those are,

Proper to superiors that are not Ministers; or to Ministers, not as they are
Ministers, but as they are governors in their private families; as namely,
such good things omitted as ought to be performed by them to their inferiors
for the good of their souls: which is done two ways especially,

1 When they use not the means by which their inferiors, Genesis 18.19. Deuteronomy.
6.7. Josh. 24.15. Ephesians. 6.4.
and such as be any way under their charge, may be taught and instructed in the
knowledge of God, and of good things that concern their salvation.

2 When they do not hinder their inferiors and such as be under their charge
(as much as they may) from falling into sin; Number. 25.4. 1. Sam. 2.23.24. 1.
Sam. 3.13. compared with 1. King. 20.42.
or do not seek to reclaim them when they have sinned, by due reproof, or
due punishment, according to their power; but rather do wink at their faults,
or use too much lenity in censuring of them.

Things of practice, and those

Proper to superiors that are not Ministers, or to Ministers, not as they are
Ministers, Psalm. 101.2. Pro. 29.12. Pro. 11.29. Pro. 25.27.
but as they are governors in their private families, are such evil things done
by them as do minister matter of infection and poison to the souls of their
inferiors; as when they either teach them errors or lewd things, or else go
before them in the practice of sin.

Things of omission proper to Ministers as they be Ministers, and have the
charge of the souls of others, that do hurt or hinder the life of the soul of
another or others, are two especially; the one inward in the heart, and the
other outward.

The inward thing in the heart, namely, Mat. 9.36. Mat. 6.34.
the want of pity and feeling compassion toward them, whose souls they have
taken charge of, in regard of the miseries and the wants of their souls; which
comes from hence, because they either do not see and take notice, Pro. 27.23.
or they will not see and take notice, as they ought, of the miseries and wants
of the souls of their people, though they be told of them and made acquainted
with them.

The outward thing, namely the omitting of such good things which ought to be
performed by them, to those, whose souls they have taken charge of, for the
good of their souls: and this is done two ways,

1 When through insufficiency, Isa. 56.10. Ierem. 2.34. Pro. 29.18. Mat. 5.13.
Mat. 15.14.
being Idol pastors, dumb dogs, and blind guides, they do not at all
teach, and admonish their people of their sins, and danger they are in by
reason of their sins.

2 When though they be able, yet either through sloth or negligence, being
present with their people; or by reason of their absence, Ezec. 3.17.18 Ezec.
33.7.8. Ezech. 34.2.3 to 10. Zach. 11.15.16.17. Act. 20.26.27.28. Heb. 13.17.
they being not resident and abiding among their people (as they ought) they do
either not preach to their people, and admonish them of their sins plainly
and faithfully, or they preach to them very seldom.

Things of practice proper to Ministers as they be Ministers, and have charge
of the souls of others, that do hurt or hinder the life of the soul of another
or others, are either things

In their teaching; and they are either flattering teaching, Ierem. 6.14.
Ierem. 23.17.31.32. Ezech. 13.10.16. Romans 16.18. Ephesians 4.13. 1. Tim. 3.4. Tit.
1.10. Mat. 15 4.5.6.9.
or corrupt teaching.

Or in their manner of living, as namely, such evil things done by them in the
sight of their people, as do minister matter of infection to their souls.

As when Ministers go on in the practice of sin openly, and do live wickedly
and loosely in the face of their people. 1. Sam. 2.24. Ierem. 23.14. Galat.
2.13.


It requires every thing that tends to the maintenance and preservation of
the life of man, and to the welfare and safety of his body and soul.

And the things tending to the maintenance and preservation of the life of the
body of man, and safety of his body are; either

Such things as tend to the maintenance and preservation of the life of a man's
own body, and to the welfare and safety of his own body. Or such things as
tend to the maintenance and preservation of the life of the body of another,
and to the welfare and safety of the body of another or others.

The things that tend to the maintenance and preservation of the life of a man's
own body, and to the welfare and safety of his own body, are these two things:

1 The procuring and using of all good and lawful means, within his power,
and according to his ability, that serve to keep and defend his body from
violence, and from danger, and from hurt: and those are four especially:

1 The turning away of unjust violence, 1. Sam. 21.8. Mat. 26.51.52 1. Pet.
2.20.
offered to his body by or from others, if he be able by his own power and
strength, so far as his place and calling will suffer him.

2 The avoiding of the hands of such persons as seek by violence to hurt his
body and to shed his blood; Genesis 27.42.43 Exodus 2.15. 1. King. 19.3. Mat. 2.13.
Mat. 12.14.15 Ioh. 7.1. and 8.59. Act. 14.5.6.
by flying from them, or by hiding himself from them, he being not able to
withstand them in regard of their power and greatness: if he be not hindered
by his private or public calling.

1 1. King. 1.12 13.14. etc. Pro. 16.15. Romans 13.4.
The seeking and the using of the help of others, and especially of the
Magistrate as Gods lieutenant, to beepe his body from unjust violence.

4 The avoiding of such things as may hurt his body, Genesis 12.10. and 26.1.
Ruth. 1.1. Genesis 7.7. Pro. 22.3. Luke 21.20.21
as a general famine, contagious sickness, sword, floods, fire, and such
like; by flying from them and by removing of his body from one place to
another, by shrowding himself under some covert, if he be not hindered by his
place and calling, and so as it be not to the hinderance and to the hurt of
another.

2 The procuring and using of all good and lawful means according to his
ability and power, that are helpful and profitable for the continuance of the
health and strength of his body, and for the preventing of sickness and
weakness of his body, and for the recovery of the health and strength of his
body when they are impaired; and those means are four especially.

1 Necessary and wholesome food, Genesis 28.20. Pro. 30.8. Mat. 6.11. 1. Tim. 5.23.
Eccles. 10.16.17.
clothing, and lodging, using them seasonably and moderately.

Honest and lawful mirth, and rejoicing in an holy manner, and sometimes using
the help of Music, 2. King. 3.15. Pro. 15.13. Pro. 17.22. Nehem. 8.10.
Eccles. 3.4. Philip. 4.4. Exodus 21.19. 2. King. 20.7. Ierem. 8.22. Mat. 9.12.
2. Chro. 16.12
by singing or playing on an instrument of Music, or by hearing others sing or
play; so as it be with moderation, and in due time and season.

3 The help of Physic and Chyrurgerie as occasion is given, using good and
lawful medicines; and not trusting in them, as able to do any good of
themselves, but entreating the Lord for a blessing on them.

4 Honest and lawful exercise, moving and stirring of his body, Ioh. 10.23. 2.
Sam. 1.18. Genesis 27.3.
and that seasonably and in fit time and place, without the just offense of
any; and that more or less as the state of his body requires, and as his
calling will suffer him, as walking running, leaping, and such like.

Such things as tend to the maintenance and preservation of the life of the
body of another, and to the welfare and safety of the body of another, are
either,

Inward in the heart, or outward things.

Things inward in the heart, Ephesians. 4.32. Galat 5.22. Coloss. 3.12.
are four especially.

1 A kind and loving disposition of the heart, or kind heartednes toward
all, whereby men or women are tractable and easy to be used and to be employed
for the good of others whosoever they be, in any thing wherein they may do them
good, as occasion is offered, without hurt or wrong to themselves or others.

2 Such a meek quiet, Eccles. 7.11. Mat. 11.29. Ephesians. 4.2. Galat. 5.23.
Coloss. 3.12. 1. Pet. 3 4. Number. 12.3. Pro. 14.29. Pro. 15.18. 1. Cor. 13.4.
Galat. 5.22. Coloss. 3.13.
and calm disposition of the heart, as is neither prone to provoke, nor easily
provoked to anger, by injuries or wrongs offered or done. The highest degree
whereof is long suffering, which is when men or women, being much or often
provoked by injurious words and deeds, do notwithstanding quietly pass them
over, and put them up, and are still quiet and calm, and not provoked to
anger: which meekness and long suffering is to be expressed;

First, Galat. 6.2. Ephesians 4.2. Coloss. 3.13.
in a quiet bearing with the infirmities and frailties of others, as their
hastiness, slownesse, rashness, and such like: and with the passions and
perturbations appearing in their actions, so far forth as they are
troublesome, grievous and displeasing to us.

Secondly, in a free remission of revenge, Mat. 6.12. Ephesians. 4.32. Coloss. 3.13.
neither carrying in our hearts any purpose of revenge for wrongs done to us,
or supposed to be done to us; or returning punishment and evil for evil, in
way of requital for them.

3 An inward fellow-feeling of that which befalls others in respect of their
bodies, Romans 12.15. 1. Cor. 12.25.26.
and that two ways:

First, by rejoicing with others that have just cause of rejoicing, Psalm.
35.27. Luke 1.58. Philip. 1.26.
for their outward good and prosperity seen or heard of.

Secondly, Psalm. 35.13.14 Ephesians. 4.32. Coloss. 3.13. Heb. 13.3. 1 Pet. 3.8.
by mourning and grieuing with others that have just cause of heaviness,
mourning, and grief, for their outward evil, distress and adversity, seen
or heard of; and by pitying them, and by being tender hearted to them.

4 An heart disposed to peace and quietness, Romans 12.18. Galat. 5.22. Coloss.
3.15. 1 Thessalonians. 4.11.
and a care and desire to maintain concord and good agreement amongst men, as
much as is possible and in our power; which is to be expressed in three things
especially:

First, Pro. 17.14. Pro. 19.11. Pro. 20.3. Iam. 3.17. Genesis 13.8.9. Mat. 17.27.
in passing by offenses so far as they concern us in particular, and may be
passed over without hurt or wrong to our selves, or to others; and sometimes
for quietness sake, in parting from our own right.

Secondly, in construing things in the best sense, 2. Sam. 10.3. 1. Cor. 13.5.
and taking every thing (if it be possible) in the best part.

Thirdly, in meddling with our own matters and businesses, 1 Thessalonians. 4.11. 1.
Pet. 4.15.
and such things as concern us in regard of our callings and conditions of
life.

Outward things are either such as serve to auert and turn away evil, wrong,
hurt, or danger from the body of another or others: Or, such as serve for the
good, the help and comfort of the body of another or others.

Such as serve to auert and turn away evil, wrong, hurt, or danger from the
body of another or others, are either, in speech and in word: Or in act and
deed.

In speech or in word, as namely, such words and speeches uttered, Pro. 12.6.
Pro. 24.11.12
as are for the defense and help of innocent persons that are helpelesse,
being either under the hands of oppressors, or followed and pursued by
oppressors, seeking to hurt and to wrong them either in their bodies or lives;
and men are to speak for the defense and help of such persons three ways:

First, by speaking for them as they are able, Gen 37.21.22 1 Samuel 20.32. Hest.
7.3.4.5.6.
and according to their place and calling, in private to the face of the
oppressor or oppressors, to dissuade him or them from offering or doing wrong
unto them in respect of their bodies and lives.

Secondly, by speaking and pleading for them as they are able, Hest. 4.8. Job.
29.12.13 to 18. Ierem. 38.7.8 9. Luke 23.13.14 to. 22.
and according to their place and calling, either as witnesses, or as
advocates, or as Judges publicly in some open Court, for the freeing of them
from wrong done or offered to be done to them, in respect of their bodies or
lives; especially they being poor, fatherless, widows, or strangers; or
being religious, and yet such as either cannot or dare not plead for
themselves.

Thirdly, Act 1^.4.5. Romans 15 30.31.
by speaking to God for them as they are able, in prayer, by commending their
case to the Lord, 2 Thessalonians. 3.1.2
and calling on him in prayer for their succor and relief.

In act and deed, as namely, such acts and deeds done, Exodus 2.17.18.19. Judge.
2.16. Iud. 3.9.15.31
as are for the help and succor of innocent persons, that are helpless, being
either under oppression and wrong, or pursued by oppressors, seeking to hurt or
wrong them in their bodies or lives. And men are to do things, serving for the
help and succor of such persons, either

Against known evils and wrongs already done to them, Genesis 14 14.15.16. 1. Sam.
30.17.18. Job. 29.12.17. Pro. 24.11.
and that as they are able, and according to their place and calling, by using
their poer and strength for the rescuing and delivering them from under their
oppressions and wrongs:

Or against known evils and wrongs that are in doing, or intended to be done
to them, and that as they are able, by interposing their power and strength to
defend and to save them from those evils and wrongs. And that either,

As private persons, by using their hands, their purses, Josh. 2.4.6. 1. King.
18.4. 2. Sam. 21.14.15.16. Romans 16.14. 1. Ioh. 3.16.
and their pains, so far as they are able to protect and to save them from
violence or spoil, especially when the violence or spoil intended, is sudden,
and the Magistrate is absent, and it is dangerous to stay for his coming; and
sometimes so far, as to the hazard of their own lives, as when it is to the
defending and saving of the bodies and lives of such (...) are special
instruments of Gods glory, and of common good, either in Church or Commonwealth:

Or, as Magistrates, by drawing out and using the sword according to their
place and power, Exodus 18.21. Romans 13.4. Exodus 2.11.12 Act. 7.24.
to protect and to save them from violence or hurt, whether it be in doing, or
intended to be done, either by their own subjects, or by forreiners.

Such things as serve for the good, the help and comfort of the body of
another or others, are either

In speech or word, or in act and deed.

Things in speech or word, as namely, Tit. 3.2. 1. Pet 3.16.
such words and such speeches uttered and spoken, as do express meekness,
gentleness, kindness and love to those to whom they are uttered and spoken.
And the words and speeches wherein men are to express meekness, gentleness,
kindness and love, are of three sorts especially:

1 Their salutations, Ioh. 1.38. and 20.16. Judge. 6.12. Ruth. 2.4. Luke. 1.28.
and 10.5. Ioh. 20.19.
when they meet with others, they are to salute them being their equals or
inferiors, by their names or surnames; and their superiors, by names of
honor or office, giving them such tiles of reverence, as of right belong to
them, wishing them good health, prosperity or good success, and the like, as
occasion is offered.

2 Their answers; men are to give to others soft answers, Judge. 8.2.3. 1. Sam.
25.10 11.12.13. Pro 15.1. 2. King. 18.36 1. Sam. 1.15. Dan. 6.21.22. Ioh.
8.48.49. 1. Pet. 3.9. Genesis 13.8. Galat. 6.1.
such as may neither kindle nor increase anger in them; and when they are
rayled on, they are not to rail again, and when they are hardly spoken of,
they are either to be silent, or only to make a just and manifest defense of
their own innocence.

3 Their admonitions and just reproves, when men do admonish or justly reprove
their brethren for their faults committed of ignorance or of frailty,

Or in act and deed: and those are either,

In countenance and in some gesture and carriage of the body, Genesis 31.2.5. Genesis
30.10.
as namely, all such looks and gestures of the body as do express meekness,
1. Sam. 25.17. Pro. 16.15. Genesis 2.3.7.12
gentleness, kindness, and love to another or others, without dissimulation:

Or other acts and deeds; and those are of two sorts:

First, such acts and deeds done, as do express kindness and love to those to
whom they are done, Genesis 14 18.31 2. Sam. 19.28.31. 1. King. 10.10 13. Ierem.
40.5. Act. 20.38.
and are for the continuance of the health, welfare, comfort and good estate of
the body of another, or the bodies of others; as the bestowing of gifts and
benefits, and good turns on others.

Secondly, such acts and deeds done as do express kindness and love, Job.
31.16.17. to 21. Pro. 21.13. Pro. 31.20. Isai. 58.7. Mat. 25.35.36.42.43.
and tender affection to those to whom they are done, and are for the relieuing
of another or others, being in any known want or distress of body. And men
are to reach out their helping hands according to their ability and means, for
the relief of such:

Sometimes to the entertainment of them to bed, or board, or both, Job. 31.32.
Iud. 19.20.21. Romans 12.13. Heb. 13.2. 1. Pet. 4.9.
especially they being strangers and harbourlesse, and for the Lords cause, and
for a good conscience persecuted.

And especially to such as they are bound unto, Job. 19.13.14. to 22. Leuit.
25.35. Romans 12.13. Galat. 6.10.
by some near and special bond of place, calling or condition, or of nature
or grace.

The duty that belongs to the dead body of another, Genesis 23.19. Genesis 25.9.
Genesis 50.13. Ierem. 22.19. Mat. 27.60. Act. 8.2. 1 Thessalonians. 4.13.
is the burial of it, in such honest and seemly manner, as is agreeable to the
nature and credit, as well of those which remain alive, as of the party
deceassed, with moderate mourning.

The things tending to the maintenance and preservation of the life of the
soul of man, and to the welfare and safety of the soul, are either

Such things as tend to the maintenance and preservation of the life of a man's
own soul, and the welfare and safety of his own soul; or such things as
tend to the maintenance and preservation of the life of the soul of another or
others, and to the welfare and safety of the soul of another or others.

The things which tend to the maintenance and preservation of the life of a
man's own soul, and the welfare and safety of his own soul, are two things
especially:

First, a careful avoiding of all such things as tend to the destroying of his
own soul, Pro. 4.14.15. Pro. 5.8.11. Pro. 7.25.26.27. Pro. 11.19. Romans 2.5.
1. Pet. 3.10.11.
as all sorts of sins, especially known sins, and the living and continuing
in any known sin, willingly and obstinately, and with delight.

Secondly, a careful use of the means that God has ordained, both for the
beginning, Deuteronomy. 30.19.20. Romans 10.14.17. 1. Pet. 2.2. Pro. 2.1.2.3. Pro.
4.20.21. Pro 7.1.2.3.4. Pro. 8.33. Isai. 55.3. Coloss. 3.16. 1 Thessalonians. 2.13
Pro. 16.14. Ephesians. 2.10. Philip. 2.12. 1. Pet. 1.5.6. to 12. Psalm. 92.14. 2.
Pet. 3.18.
and for the continuance of grace and of spiritual life in the soul, both in
public and in private; as the word preached or read, the Sacraments, prayer
and such like, attending on them diligently, and using them conscionably, with
care to profit by them, and a careful walking in the way of life and of
salvation, by diligence to finish his own salvation, by adding daily one
measure of grace to another, and by making his own calling and election sure
by the fruits of faith.

The things which tend to the maintenance and preservation of the life of the
soul of another or others, and to the welfare and safety of the soul of
another or others, are such things as serve either for the procuring or helping
forward of the spiritual life and salvation of another or others one, 1. Cor.
10.33. Pro. 11.30. Dan. 12.3. Romans 15.2. Iam. 5.19.20.
or more; as by doing such things as tend to the winning of their souls, and
to their edification and building up in grace and goodness: and the things
that men are to do tending to that purpose, are six:

1 They are as they are able, and according to their place and calling, Genesis
18.18.19 Deuteronomy. 6.7. Pro. 1.10. Pro. 31.1. Ioh. 1.35.36. to 45.
and as present occasion is offered, to teach and to instruct others to know
God and the good ways of God, and to counsel and to advise them in such
things as concern their sanctification and salvation, especially such as be
under their charge, they being such as have the government of others, Act.
20.26.27 Coloss. 3.16.
and are over others in public or in private, as Ministers or governors in
the family.

2 Secondly, they are as they are able, and according to their place and
calling, and as present occasion is offered, Pro. 27.27. Heb. 10.24. 2. Chro.
19.9. 1. Chro. 20.20 2. Chro. 32.7. 1 Thessalonians. 5.11. 1. Tim. 5.1.2. Heb. 3.13.
Romans 13.3. 1. Cor. 11.2.
to provoke and to excite and stir up others to holiness and well-doing, and
to harten and encourage them in well-doing, especially such as be under their
charge, they being such as have the government of others; and that by
persuading and exhorting them to good things, and by praising, commending and
countenancing them when they do well.

3 Thirdly, Leuit. 19.17. Luke. 17.3. Coloss. 3.16. 1 Thessalonians. 5.14. 2. Tim.
4.2. Tit. 2. Galat. 6.1 1. Tim. 5.1.2.
they are as they are able, and according to their place and calling, and as
present occasion is offered, to admonish and to reprove others, when they see
or know them to offend, and to do evil and sin; so as they do it fitly,
fitting their reproof to the quality of the person, whom they do reprove, and
the nature and quality of the offense, for which the person is reproved, 2.
Sam. 12.1. Tit. 1.13. Nehem. 5.7. Job. 2.10. Pro. 29.17.19
and so as they do it seasonably, and in such a time as their reproof may do
the most good. Jude epist. v. 22.23. 2. Cor. 13.2.

4 They are, Genesis 50.21. 1. Sam. 23.16. 2. Sam. 10.2. Job. 6.14.15. Isai.
40.1.2. Mat. 14 27. 1 Thessalonians. 4.18. 1 Thessalonians. 5.14. Job. 16.2. Job. 19.21.
Isai. 50.4.
as they are able, and according to their place and calling; and as present
occasion is offered, to comfort others when they see or know them to stand in
need of comfort, in regard of their troubles and distresses, especially in
regard of troubles, afflictions and distresses of their minds and consciences
for sin; so as they do it wisely, with due consideration of the quality of
the person afflicted, and so as they do it in such a time as comfort may do the
party afflicted most good.

5 They are, as they are able, and according to their place and calling, Ierem.
42.2.3 Genesis 43.29. Genesis 48.15.
and as present occasion is offered, to pray for others standing in need of
their prayers, 1 Chro. 22.12. James 5.15
for the good of their souls; especially for such as they are bound unto by
some near and special bond of nature, place, calling or condition.

6 They are, as they are able, and according to place and calling, Mat. 5.16. 2
Cor. 9.2. 1 Pet. 2.12. 1 Pet. 3.6.
and as present occasion is offered, to give good example to others, living in
their sight without giving just offense, and walking before them in the
practice of good things; especially to such as they are bound unto by some
near and special bond of nature, place, calling, or condition.

The end of the sixth Commandment.
The 7. Commandment. The Negative part.
It forbids all manner of uncleanness, and fleshly defilement, and all things
that hurt or hinder chastity in man or woman; and these things are either
Inward or Outward.

Inward, in the heart, as namely, filthy imaginations, Matt. 5.28.
and unchaste thoughts, Coloss. 3.5.
and inward lusts and motions of the heart, to uncleanness, whereunto the
heart does give consent; or purposes and desires of the heart to any act of
uncleanness and fleshly defilement, which are then most vile and most odious,
when they are so violent and strong, as that they continually boil and burn
within, and give a man or a woman no rest, but are ever stirring and provoking
them to the committing of some filthy act of uncleanness.

Outward, and those are either things going before the act of uncleanness and
fleshly defilement, or the acts of uncleanness and fleshly pollution.

Things going before the act of uncleanness and fleshly defilement, are either
further off, as preparatiues and prouocations to it, or nearer to it, than
preparatiues and prouocations.

Further off, as preparatiues and prouocations to it; and those are either such
things as stir up filthy lust, and make the body fit for uncleanness, or
such things as help forward the fitness of the body for uncleanness. Such
things as stir up filthy lust, and make the body fit for uncleanness, Ier.
5.8. Eze. 16.49. Romans 13.13 Hosea 7.6. Genesis 19.31, 33, 34, 35. Pro. 23.30, 31,
33. Isay 5.11. Romans 13.13 Ephesians. 5.18 Deuteronomy. 23.10
and those are,

First, gluttony, or excess in eating, and pampering of the belly with meats.

Secondly, drunkenness, or excess in drinking.

Thirdly, lustful dreams, coming from surfeiting and drunkenness, from
whence come nocturnall pollutions.

Fourthly, Idleness, as when men or women spend their strength, 2 Samuel 11.1.
Eze. 16.49. 1 Timothy 5.13
and the time God gives them, wherein they ought to be employed in some honest
labors of mind or body, in excessive sleeping, and in sluggishnesse, in ease
and in doing nothing, but following their sensual pleasures.

Such things as help forward the fitness of the body for uncleanness, and
those are,

1 Any light, Ezec. 16.49
vain, immodest either setting out of the body, Prou. 7.10. 1 Timothy 2.9, 10. 1
Pet. 3.3. 1 Cor. 11.14. 2 King. 9.30. Ier. 4.30. Isai. 3.16, 17, 18, 19, etc.
or carrying of the body in diverse particulars, as namely, by riotous,
lascivious, garish, disguised, and newfangled attire, long shagge hair, by
platting, curling, frizling, or powdering the hair, or by wearing false hair,
painting the face, laying out of the naked breasts, stretching out of the neck,
tinckling with the feet, and such like.

2 The keeping company with lascivious, wanton, Genesis 39.10 Psalm. 50.18. Prou.
5.8. and 7.7, 8, 9, 10. Ephesians. 5.5.7.
and filthy persons, and the frequenting of lewd houses, houses of filthiness.

3 Immodest, unchaste, ribald and filthy speaking, Ephesians. 4 20. and 5.3, 4.
Coloss. 3.8.

4 The reading of unchaste and filthy books, books of love matters, of
dalliance and filthiness, 1 Cor. 15.33. Act. 19.19.

5 Idle and curious looking of men upon women, or of women upon men, Genesis 6.2.
and 39.7. and 34.1, 2.

6 The looking upon lascivious, 2 Samuel 11.2 Job 31.1. 2 Pet. 2.14. Numb. 15.1,
2, 3. Ezech. 23.14, 15, 16. Ephesians. 5.3, 4.
filthy, and unseemly pictures, and the beholding of loue-matters, and the
light behavior of men or women, represented and set out, not only by speech,
but by gesture, and by conueyances and devices in stage plays and comedies.

7 Immodest and wanton dancing, Exodus 32.6. Job 21.11, 12. Mark. 6.21, 22.
mixed dancing of men and women together in number and measure artificially,
especially after solemn Feasts, and at merry meetings.

Things nearer to it than preparatiues and prouocations, and those are,

1 The wearing of apparel not fit for the sex, Deuteronomy. 22.5. Job 24.15. Genesis
38.15.

2 Wanton kissing, and embracing, and unchaste touching and dalliance, Genesis
39.12. Prou. 7.13. Deuteronomy. 25.11, 12.

3 The moving, and entising, and persuading to the very act of uncleanness and
fleshly, pollution, Genesis 38.7, 10, 12. Prou. 7.14 to 21.

The acts of uncleanness and fleshly pollution, which are either with ones
self or with others.

With ones self; and chastity is hurt or hindered in man or woman with
themselves, 1 Cor. 6.9.
by effeminat wantonness, and by doing as Onan did, Genesis 38.9. when men or
women abuse their own bodies, and by any way or means provoke and procure
themselves to do as he did.

With others, with one other alone, or with many others.

With one other alone, which is either by married persons, man and wife
between themselves, or by such as are not married one to another.

By married persons, man and wife between themselves, and that either in
respect of their entrance into marriage, or in regard of their after proceeding
and use of marriage.

In respect of their entrance into marriage, Exo. 22.16, 17. Deuteronomy. 7.3. Ier.
29.6. 1 Cor. 7.38
which is, when they company together and have secret society one with
another, as man and wife; and yet are either such as entered into that state
without due consent of their parents, neither having it at the time of their
entrance, nor having gained it afterward.

Or they are such as ought not to have married together, being within the
degrees of consanguinitie or affinity forbidden in the word of God, Leuit. 18,
6. to 18. and 20.20, 21. Mark. 6.18. 1 Cor. 5.1.

In regard of their after proceeding and use of marriage, and that two ways:

1 When they use the mariagebed intemperately and immoderately, not for
procreation, or for yielding the due benevolence or debt one to another, or for
the avoiding of fornication, but merely for the satisfaction of their
unbridled pleasures, 1 Thessalonians. 4.4, 5. Hebr. 13.4.

2 When they use the mariagebed unseasonably, and that is done two ways:

First, if they know each other carnally, whilst it is with the woman after
the manner of women, Genesis 18.11. Leuit. 18.19. and 20.18. Ezech. 18.6. and
22.10.

Secondly, if they know each other carnally in the time of public humiliation,
in the time of a solemn Fast, taken up and used in regard of some grievous
calamity, either imminent or like to fall on the Church or Commonweal, or
already upon it, 2 Samuel 11.11. Joel 2.16. Zach. 12.12. 1 Cor. 7.5.

By such as are not married one to another, and that two ways:

1 When such as are not married one to another, do commit some act of
uncleanness and fleshly defilement one with another, which is unnatural, and
against nature; and that is done three ways:

1 By Sodomitrie, which is uncleanness and defilement of the body, committed
between them that are of one and the same sex, Leuit. 18.22. and 20.13. Romans
1.26, 27. 1 Cor. 6.9. 1 Timothy 1.10.

2 By beastialitie, which is uncleanness and defilement of the body,
committed by man or woman with a bruit beast, Leuit, 18.23. and 20.15, 16.

3 By uncleanness and defilement of the body, committed by man or woman with
the Devil, as Witches do, by their own confession, Genesis 3.1.

2 When such as are not married one to another, do commit some act of
uncleanness and defilement of the body one with another, which is natural,
and according to the course of nature corrupted; and that is done two ways:

1 By committing the sin of Incest, which is uncleanness and defilement of
the body, committed between man and woman that are near in blood, and of
kindred one to another, either by consanguinitie or affinity, Genesis 19.33. to
37. and 35.22. and 49.4. and 38.18. 2 Samuel 13.14. Ezech. 22.11. Mark. 6.18. 1
Cor. 5.1.

2 By uncleanness and defilement of the body, committed between man and
woman that are not near in blood, nor of kindred one to another, either by
consanguinitie or affinity; and that is done two ways:

1 By fornication, which is uncleanness and defilement of the body, committed
between man and woman, being both single and unmarried persons, Genesis 34.2. 1
Cor. 6.9.18. and 10.8. Heb. 13.4.

2 By adultery, which is uncleanness or defilement of the body, committed
between man and woman, being either both of them married persons, or one of
them a married person, or at least contracted, Genesis 26.10. Leuit. 18.20. and
20.10. 2 Samuel 11.4. Ier. 5.7.8. 1 Cor. 6.9. Heb. 13.4. Deuteronomy. 22.22. And Incest,
Fornication, or Adultery is most vile, and most odious, when it is committed by
violence and force, which is called Rape, Genesis 34.2. Deuteronomy. 22.25. 2 Samuel 13.14.

The acts of uncleanness and fleshly pollution of the body, committed with
many others, and that two ways:

1 By uncleanness and fleshly defilement, committed by man or by woman with
many others at large, as when a man commits filthiness with many women,
whatsoever they be; or when a woman does prostitute her body to many men, and
commits filthiness with many men, whatsoever they be, Leuit. 19.29 Deuteronomy.
23.17. Ezech. 16.28, 29. Hozea 4.2.

2 By uncleanness and defilement of the body, Genesis 4.14. and 2.14. Deuteronomy. 17.17
Mat. 19.5. Leu. 18.18. Malac. 2.15
committed by man or by woman, with many others, to whom they seem to be bound
by the bond of marriage; as when a man has more than one wife at one and the
same time, and has carnal copulation with them: or when a woman has more
than one husband, at one and the same time, and has carnal conjunction with
them.

The Affirmative part of the seventh Commandment.
It requires in general two things:

1 Chastity both inward and outward, which is cleanness and purity both of
the soul and of the body of man or woman, touching the matter of generation.
And inward chastity, and cleanness, and purity of the soul of man or woman,
touching the matter of generation, stands in a freedom by grace from fleshly
concupiscence, Matt. 5.28. and 15.19. 1 Cor. 7.34 Coloss. 3.5.
the heart being by grace free from filthy uncleanness and unchaste thoughts,
and from inward filthy lusts, and from purposes and desires to any act of
uncleanness and fleshly defilement.

And outward chastity, and cleanness, and purity of the body of man or
woman touching the matter of generation, Genesis 39.8, 9, 10, 12. 1 Cor. 7.1. 1 Thessalonians. 4.3, 4. 1 Timothy 4.12 Revel. 14.4
stands in not putting in execution the concupiscence of the flesh in any act
of uncleanness and fleshly defilement, in any kind whatsoever, either with
themselves or with others, be it with one other or with many others.

2 A careful using of such things as are helps to preserve chastity, and do
tend to the preservation of cleanness and purity both inward and outward,
both of the soul and of the body of man or woman, touching the matter of
generation, and those are seven things:

1 The fear of God especially, a fear of God in respect of his Word and
Commandment, that forbids uncleanness and fleshly defilement both of soul
and body, in any kind whatsoever, Genesis 20.11. and 39.9. Eccles. 7.28.

2 A true delight in the word of God, and in his holy ordinances, Psalm. 119.9.
Prou. 2.10.16. and 5.1, 2, 3. and 6.20. to 24.

3 Modesty or shamefastness, which is an holy abhorring of all filthiness
and fleshly defilement, accompanied with a careful observing of Christian
comeliness, and with a certain grief and fear, lest any thing uncomely
should be committed, Ephesians. 5.3.4. which is to be expressed,

1 In the speech and in the words of men and women, namely, in decent talk and
chaste speeches, they using as seemly words as may be chosen, when they are to
mention things that may move blushing, and using little and submisse speech,
Genesis 4.1. Psalm 51. in the title, Prou. 10.19. and 7.11.

2 In countenance and gesture, and the carriage of the body and outward
behavior, men and women so looking and carrying their eyes and countenances,
as that they neither thereby express the filthy lusts of their own hearts,
nor give just occasion to stir up the concupiscence of heart in others, and
in gravity in their carriage and outward behavior, Genesis 24.65. Job 31.1.
Prou. 6.25. and 7.13. Ier. 3.3. Tit. 2.3.7.

3 In apparel, 1 Timothy 2.9, 10. 1 Pet. 3.3, 4
men and women are to cover their bodies with decent and comely apparel, and
that decency and comeliness in apparel stands in two things: First, in
covering the whole body with it, some parts excepted, as the hands and face,
for necessities sake, Genesis 3.10.21. Deuteronomy. 28.48. Ezech. 16.7, 8. Secondly, in
being decent and comely for the form and fashion of it, which is, when it is
according to the sex, and according to the office and calling, order and
degree, that men or women have in the societies of men, public or private, and
according to their ability, and framed according to the ancient custom of the
place and Country where they live, and to the example of the grauest, and the
most godly, and sober minded men and women of their own place, order, degree
and age, Deuteronomy. 22.5. Matthew. 11.8. Zephan. 1.8. 1 Cor. 11.16. Philip. 4.8. 1
Pet. 3.5.

4 Temperance or sobriety, which is a moderate and sober use of such things as
belong to the body, Gal. 5.23. 1 Timothy 3.2. Tit. 1.8. and 2.12. 2 Pet. 1.6.
agreeable to time, place, and persons, which is to be exercised and expressed,

1 In diet, Pro. 23.29. to 33. Eccle. 7.10. Luke 21.34 Ephe. 5.18. 1 Cor. 9.27
2 Cor. 6.6.
men and women using meats and drinks, so far forth as they may serve to
refresh nature, and to make them fit for the service of God and man, and
sometimes in convenient abstinence, abstaining from the necessary and
ordinary food of their bodies, for a time, as need does require, and as their
strength may bear, without abolishing and destroying nature.

2 In sleep, men and women taking so much sleep as may make them better able
to do all the good duties that concern them toward God and men; Pro. 20.13.
2 Cor. 6.6. and 11.22.
sometimes refraining from sleep, and watching as need requires, and as they
are able, so as it be not to the destruction of nature.

3 In lawful pleasures and honest delights, men and women using them only so
far forth as they be no prouocations to fleshly lust, nor hindrances to them
in good duties toward God or man, Romans 13.14. 1 Cor. 7.29, 30. Gal. 5.13.

5 In diligence and painfulnesse in good duties: 2 Samuel 11.2, 3, 4. Ezech.
16.49. 1 Timothy 5.13
men and women are ever to be doing some good thing, either in their general
callings, as they be Christians, or in their particular callings. And the best
good thing wherein they are to be diligent and painful, is prayer to God, that
he would purify and purge their hearts from filthy lusts, 2 Cor. 12.7, 8.

6 In the single estate, having not the gift of continency, taking the benefit
of holy marriage, when other means avail not, 1 Cor. 7.2.9.36. 1 Timothy 4.3.

7 In the state of marriage, the husbands affecting of his wife, and the wifes
affecting of her husband, as they ought to affect one the other, and also the
doing of that one to the other that ought to be done, for the preserving of
pure love, and of sound and hearty affection between them, and for the
keeping of themselves faithful and constant one to the other: and they affect
one the other as they ought, Ephe. 5.25.29. Col. 3.19. Tit. 2.4. Prou. 5.18,
19. Genesis 24.67
when they love one another with a fervent and pure love, expressing that in
delighting in the love one of another continually, and cherishing one the other
as they are able. And they do that one to the other that ought to be done, for
the preserving of pure love and of sound and hearty affection between them,
and for the keeping of themselves faithful and constant one to the other three
ways:

1 By their quiet and comfortable dwelling together in one place, with no
longer absence of either from other, than shall be either on necessary
occasion, or with mutual consent, Deuteronomy. 24.5. Prou. 7.20. 1 Cor. 7.10.12.13. 1
Pet. 3.7.

2 By so carrying themselves one to the other, as that they give no just
occasion, either by word, deed or gesture, to suspect one the other of
lightness or unfaithfulness, but so as they may have good cause to repose
trust and confidence each in the other, whether present or absent, Prou. 31.11.

3 By yielding due benevolence one to the other, in the right and lawful use
of the marriage bed; using it temperatly and seasonably, and with prayer to God
for a blessing upon it, 1 Cor. 7.3, 4, 5. Heb. 13.4. Genesis 25.21. 1 Samuel 26.27.
1 Timothy 4.5.

The Table of the eighth Commandment. The Negative part.
It forbids in general every thing whatsoever, that tends to the hurt or
hinderance of the wealth and outward good estate of man; and those things are
either inward in the heart, or outward things.

1 Inward things in the heart, as inward longings and lustings of the heart
after another man's wealth, the heart giving consent unto them. Or covetous
desires in the hearts of men or women of that wealth which is none of theirs,
though they never seek to get it wrongfully, Josh. 7.21. Mica. 2.2. 2 Pet.
2.14. 1 Ioh. 2.16.

Those longings, and lustings, and covetous desires are most vile, and most
odious, when they are insatiable, and vex and disquiet the heart with carking
cares, and are so violent and strong, as they set a man or a woman forward to
get another man's wealth against conscience, sense and reason, and sometimes
against the light of nature, 1 King. 21.4.19, 20. Matthew. 26.14, 15, 16. Eccles.
4.8. 1 Timothy 6.9, 10.

2 Outward things, and those are either

Such as tend to the hurt or hinderance of a man or a woman's own wealth and
outward good estate:

Or such as tend to the hurt or hinderance of a man or a woman's own wealth,
and outward good estate:

Or such as tend to the hurt or hinderance of the wealth and outward good
estate of another, or others, one or more.

Such things as tend to the hurt or hinderance of a man or a woman's own wealth
and outward good estate, are either

Such things as do waste and consume a man or a woman's own wealth and outward
good estate, are three things especially:

1 Idleness, sloth, and negligence, Prou. 6.6. to 12. and 12.11. and 13.4.
Prou. 20.4.13. and 18.9. and 24.30, 31, 32, 33, 34. 2 Thessalonians. 3.10, 11, 12.

2 Unthriftiness and carelessness, either in ordering or spending a man or a
woman's goods, Ioh. 6.12. Prou. 21.17. and 23.21. Luke 15.13, 14, 15, 16.

3 Rash, heedlesse, and unadvised suretiship, Prou. 6.1, 2, 3. and 11.15. and
17.18. and 20.16. Prou. 22.26, 27.

Or such things as do defraud a man or a woman of the right and comfortable
use of their wealth, as namely, a base, covetous, needy, and an evil eye or
niggardly sparing, when there is just and necessary cause of spending, Eccles.
2.26. Eccles. 4.8. Eccles. 6.1, 2.

Such things as tend to the hurt or hinderance of the wealth and outward good
estate of another, or others, one or more.

And those are such things as tend to the hurt or hinderance of the wealth and
outward good estate,

Either of the Church,

Or Commonwealth,

Or some particular person or persons, one or more.

Those things which tend to the hurt or hinderance of the outward good estate
of the Church, are two things:

First, Romans 2.22.
Sacrilege or Church-robberie.

Secondly, Symonie.

Sacrilege or Church-robbery is committed two ways:

First, by diminishing or by withdrawing and taking to ones self in whole or
in part, those things that either by the commandment of God, or by the free
and voluntary gift of man, or by the law of man are appointed and set apart
for religious uses, as for the maintaining of the Minister of the Word, or of
Universities and Schools of good learning, Josh. 7.21.
or for the maintenance and relief of the poor, as Hospitals, Almes-houses
and such like, Pro. 20.25. Malac. 3.8, 9, 10.
or do any way belong to the worship and service of God, as the place
appointed for the public worship and service of God, the Church commonly so
called, or the Communion table, Cups, Books, and such like.

Secondly, Ier. 23.1, 2. Ezech. 34.2, 3, 8. Phil. 2.21. Judge. 9.4. Dan. 5.2, 3.
Mat. 21.12, 13.
By employing things appointed and set apart for religious uses, to other ends
and purposes, and by abusing them, especially by such as have the benefit and
use of them.

Simonie, or buying and selling of Church-offices or places to exercise those
offices in, Acts 8.18, 19. 2 King. 5.20, 21. Mat. 23.4.
and consequently, buying and selling of the mysteries and Sacraments of the
Church, and of spiritual things for private gain, which is properly Simonie.

Those things which tend to the hurt or hinderance of the Commonwealth, are
three:

1 The robbing of the public treasury, 2 King. 12.18. Neh. 13.7.
and direct taking away from the common stock, and from the goods that belong
either to the Crown, 12.13.
or to the whole Kingdom, or to some City or corporation.

2 The defrauding of such gifts as are given for public uses, and are to be
employed for the common good, John 12.6.
as for the maintaining of common highways and such like.

3 The doing of such things as bring damage and detriment to the Commonwealth,
and do procure and cause a dearth and scarcity of such outward good things as
are of necessary use in a Land and Country, in a City, Town, or Village,
which is done three ways:

1 By hording up and withholding the selling of corn, Pro. 11.26. James 5.1,
2, 3.
and of other necessary commodities which men or women have of their own,
when they may spare them, and others have need of them, in hope to raise the
price of them.

2 By getting up all a commodity into ones hand, Mica 3.3.
Amos 8.4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
either to carry out of the Land, or to sell it as men list themselves, even
the very refuse, as by engrossing commodities, forestalling markets, and such
like.

3 By uncharitable enclosure, Isay 3.14. Isay 5.8.
as by dispeopling houses and towns, and by enclosing common fields to men's
own private benefit and gain.

Those things that hurt or hinder the wealth and outward good estate of some
particular person, or persons, one or more, are things done either in matter of
contract between person and person, or persons one or more, or out of the
matter of contract.

Things that are done in the matter of contract, between person and person, or
persons one or more are either in buying and selling, and exchanging; Or in
borrowing and lending; Or in hiring and letting; Or in pawning, and taking
things to pawn.

Things that are done in buying and exchanging, are either by the buyer or by
the seller, or by the buyer and the seller.

The things which are done by the buyer, are three.

1 The extenuating the goodness of the things which the buyer cheapneth
contrary to his own knowledge either by himself or by another. Pro. 20.14.
Isay 5.20.


2 Genesis 23.9.13.
The taking advantage of the sellers either simplicity or present necessity,
Leu. 25.14, 15, 16.
to buy his commodity, for less than it is worth.

3 The making of bad payment of the price agreed on between him and the
seller. Genesis 23.16 Ier. 32.8, 9, 10. Genesis 43.12


The things which are done by the seller, are five:

1 The praising, Psalm. 15.2. Isai. 5.20.
commending, and extolling the things he has to sell, and is about to sell
above the known goodness, and worth of them.

2 The taking advantage of the buyers either simplicity, Leu. 25.14, 15, 16.
Amos 8.5. Genesis 23.15.
or present necessity to sell his commodity for more than it is worth.

3 The selling and delivering of that which he knows to be bad ware, for good
ware, at the price of good: which is done two ways; first, by selling and
delivering that which he knows to be bad in the matter and substance of it,
for good, Isai. 1.2^. Amos 8.6.
and in the stead of good, and at the price of good. Secondly, by selling and
delivering that which he knows is bad and saultie in the quality of it, for
good, Luke 19.8. Romans 1.29. 1 Thessalonians. 4.6
and in the stead of good, at the price of good.

4 The deceiving of the buyer, Deu. 19.35, 36. Deu. 25.13, 14, 15. Ezech.
45.10. Prou. 11.1. and 20.10. Mica 6.10, 11. Pro. 11.10. Leu. 25.14, 15, 16. 1 Thessalonians. 4.6
in the number, weight, or measure of the things sold unto him, by number,
weight, or measure, and yet taking the full price agreed on between them.

5 The raising of the just price of things, and the racking of the prices of
the things he has to sell, to the oppression of the poor.

The things that are done by the buyer, and by the seller, Isay 55.12. Act.
19.24.
are the buying and selling of things either unprofitable and hurtful, as
Cards, Dice, and such like: or things that tend merely to maintain pride and
vanity, as painting and complexions, and such like.

Those things that are done to the hurt or hinderance of another, or others,
one or more, in borrowing and lending, are either done by the borrower, or by
the lender.

Those things which are done by the borrower, are two:

1 By not returning or not restoring the thing borrowed to the lender, as it
ought to be returned or restored, which is done three ways.

1 By not returning or not restoring the thing borrowed, 2 King. 6.5 Psalm.
37.21. Prou. 3.27. Romans 13.8.
to the lender at all.

2 By not returning or not restoring the thing borrowed, 2 King. 4.1. Prou.
3.28.
to the lender in due time, and at the time appointed, for the returning and
restoring of it; but keeping it over and above that time, without the consent
of the lender.

3 By not returning or not restoring again to the lender the thing borrowed,
Exo. 22.14.
which is spent in the use of it, both as much, and every way as good as was
lent in the same kind; or by not returning, or not restoring the thing
borrowed, which is not spent in the use of it, whether it be a living thing, as
a servant, an horse, or a Cow, and such like; or a thing without life, both as
much, and every way as good as it was lent.

2 The borrowing of any thing, especially money, either

To ill ends and purposes, as either to maintain himself in pride, in riot,
and such like: or that by the thing borrowed, the borrower may hurt or wrong
another, or others, one or more, in his or their wealth and outward good estate.

Or after an unlawful manner, (namely) on usury, (that is) so as the borrower
couenanteth with the lender, to return to him not only the thing lent, in the
full number, weight, measure, and quantity, but something over and above, only
in liew and recompense of the lending of it.

Those things that are done by the lender are three:

1 The lending to such persons as the lender knows do borrow to ill ends and
purposes, as to maintain themselves in pride, riot, or such like, or in any
sinful course, or to hurt, wrong, vex or trouble another, or others, one or
more.

2 The lending after an unlawful manner, namely, on usury (that is) so as the
lender will have the borrower to covenant with him to return to him, not only
the thing lent in the full number, weight, measure, and the full sum and
quantity of it, but also an overplus and something over and above, only in
liew and recompense of his lending of it.

3 The requiring of the thing lent in such manner as it ought not to be
required, which is done two ways:

First, when the lender does require the thing lent too greedily, as either
before the time appointed for the returning of it, having no extraordinary need
of it, but only out of his covetous mind, or at an unseasonable time, as on
the Sabbath, or the like.

Secondly, when the lender requires the thing lent with rigor, and with
extreme hard dealing, using cruelty toward the borrower, though he do humble
himself to him, as by casting him into prison, or the like.

Things in hiring and letting, are either done by the hirer or by the letter.

Things done by the hirer are two:

1 The not returning of the thing hired, as it ought to be returned, which is
done when the hirer either returns not the thing that he has hired at all, or
not at the time appointed for the return of it, but wittingly and purposely
keeps it over and above that time, without the consent of the letter, or not
in the state that he received it, but either hurt or spoiled through his own
default, without making due satisfaction for that hurt or spoil.

2 The not paying of the hire agreed on between him and the letter, for the
thing hired, as it ought to be paid, whether it be a thing to be used, as
house, shop, chamber, land, or the like, or a man's labor, but either
withholding it, or changing it, or not paying of it in due time.

Things done by the letter, are three:

1 The letting of a thing to hire at an unreasonable rate, which is done either
directly, as when it is let for more than can be raised and made of the use of
it in the judgment of any that knows it, and is able to judge of it; or
indirectly and under a color, as when it is let for an indifferent rate, in
respect of the use of the thing it self, yet so as the letter will not stand
to the hazard of it, but makes the hirer covenant with him absolutely, to make
the thing hired good to him at all times without any allowance, in respect of
any casualtie that shall come, though the thing hired being subject to many
casualties, do perish without his default.

2 The letting of a thing to hire of worse quality than is pretended; as when
the letter lets it to the hirer for his use, which he knows will not serve
his turn.

3 The withholding from the hirer the use of the thing he has let to him to
hire, either in whole or in part.

Things that are done to the hurt or hinderance of another, or others, one or
more, in pawning and in taking things to pawn, are things that are done by the
pawner, or by the party who takes things to pawn.

Things done by the pawner are three.

1 The pawning of such things as ought not to be laid to pawn, as ones life,
his own wearing cloths, which are for present use, and such like.

2 The pawning of things to ill ends and purposes, as for the effecting of some
wicked purpose, or the like.

3 The not fetching home of his pawn at the time appointed, for the redeeming
of it, by doing that which ought to be done for the redemption of it being able
to redeem it, but letting it still lie in the hands of the party to whom it
is pawned to his loss or hinderance.

Things done by the party who takes things to pawn are three.

1 The taking of a thing to pawn that ought not to be taken, as namely,
things that are of necessary and present use for the maintenance and
preservation of the life of man.

2 The using of the thing pawned, and taking profit and benefit of the use of
it within the compass of the time set and appointed for the redemption of it.

3 The not returning and not restoring the pawn at the time appointed for the
return of it, as it ought to be returned.

Things that are done out of the matter of contract, to the hurt or hinderance
of another, or others, one or more, are two:

First, the unjust taking away of that wealth, or any part of it, that belongs
to another, or others, one or more.

Secondly, the conspiring with those who unjustly take away that wealth, or any
part of it, that belongs to another, or others, one or more.

The unjust taking away of that wealth, or any part of it, that belongs to
another, or others, one or more, is done three ways:

1 By open violence and force, which is exercised two ways: First, by laying
violent and strong hands on that wealth which belongs to another, or others,
one or more, or any part of it, whether by sea or by land, and taking it to
ones self as a prey. Secondly, by making havoc and spoil of the wealth,
which belongs to another, or others, one or more, or any part of it. merely of
evil will, and of envy, or of a mere delight in doing mischief, without any
profit or benefit to the spoiler.

2 By secret and privy stealth, which is practiced three ways:

First, by pilfering, conueying, and secret carrying away that wealth which
belongs to another, or others, one or more, or any part of it.

Secondly, by secret and unjust wasting and consuming, and drawing from that
wealth which belongs to another, or others, one or more, or any part of it,
being such as one may come unto without suspicion.

Thirdly, by secret encroaching upon another man's wealth or possession, which
is most vile, when it is upon the wealth or possession of the fatherless or
helpless.

3 By fraud and deceit, which is used either in respect of persons or things.

In respect of the persons that belong to another, or others, one or more, as
by alluring, and by entising away by word or deed, as by persuasion, or gifts,
any person or persons that belong to another, or others, one or more.

In respect of the things that belong to another, or others, one or more, and
that is done seven ways.

1 By perverting of the Law, or corrupting judgment in cases touching lands or
goods, which is most vile, when it is done under color of equity, conscience,
and Religion.

2 By using and practicing unlawful Arts and courses to get that wealth, or
any part of it, that belongs to another, or others, one or more, as iugling,
charming, and such like.

3 By false dealing in matters of trust, touching lands or goods.

4 By concealing things strayed or found, and keeping them, and withholding
them from the right owner, being known.

5 By pretending poverty and want without just cause, and by taking alms,
when men or women have no need, whereby they do defraud the poor, and take
that which belongs to such as are truly poor.

6 By gaming for money and gain, especially at unlawful games.

7 By using devices and subtilties of wit, to get that wealth, or any part of
it, that belongs to another, or others, one or more, as lying, using another
man's name, he not knowing of it; pretending skill to do another good by
Physic, Chirurgerie, or such like, when there is no skill; or any manner of
cosenage, commonly called cony-catching, cheating, or such like.

The conspiring with those who unjustly take away that wealth, or any part of
it, that belongs to another, or others, one or more, which is done four ways:

1 By counselling, persuading, or commanding, or by hiring, or any way plotting
with another, or others, one or more, to take away that wealth, or any part of
it, that belongs to another, or others, one or more, by any unjust way or
means.

2 By being present with others, when they do unjustly take away that wealth
which belongs to another, or others, one or more, and consenting to them by
silence, and not reproving them.

3 By receiving and harboring of those, who have unjustly taken away that
wealth, or any part of it, that belongs to another, or others, one or more, and
hiding and concealing of them, and pleading for them, and by receiving, and
hiding, and concealing the things they have unjustly taken away.

4 By favoring and by upholding those who unjustly take away that wealth, or
any part of it, that belongs to another, or others, one or more, Isay 1.23.
Romans 1.31.
either by impunitie (having power to punish) or by feeding and clothing of
lusty and stout rogues and beggars.

The Affirmative part of the eighth Commandment.
It requires in general every thing whatsoever that tends to the help or
furtherance of the wealth and outward good estate of man, and those things are
either inward in the heart, or outward things.

Things inward in the heart, are two:

First, a stayednesse in the mind, and a settled purpose in the heart of man or
woman, to seek riches and outward good things, only so far as they may in the
use of lawful means, and may look for the blessing of God on their endeavors,
and so far as the Lord shall be pleased to offer them matter, and to give them
just occasion so to do, and no further.

Secondly, a contentedness of mind, with that part and portion of wealth, and
of outward good things, whether it be little or much, which God has allotted:
the ground of which contentedness of mind, is a resting by faith on the
promise of God, and a depending on his providence without distrustful care.

Outward good things, are either such things as tend to the help or
furtherance of a man or woman's own wealth, and outward good estate;

Or such things as tend to the help or furtherance of the wealth and outward
good estate of another, or others, one or more.

Such things as tend to the help or furtherance of a man or woman's own wealth
and outward good estate, are either concerning the getting of wealth, the
keeping of wealth, or the using of wealth.

Things that concern the getting of wealth, are two:

First, an honest and lawful particular calling, wherein every one being of
years, is to walk and to be employed.

Secondly, Diligence, and painfulnesse, and faithful labor in that honest
particular calling, wherein a man or a woman is set.

Things that concern the keeping of wealth, are two:

First, frugality or thriftinesse, and a care to save that wealth which God
has given.

Secondly, peaceablenesse, and a care to keep and hold that wealth which God
has given, with peace, avoiding law and contention, as much as is possible.

Things that concern the using of wealth, are two:

First, a wise, convenient, and seasonable dispensing of the wealth which God
has given to any, to the honest maintenance of themselves and their families,
if they have any.

Secondly, a moderation in spending that wealth which God has given to any
person, man or woman, ordering and limiting their expenses to the proportion of
their means.

Such things as tend to the help or furtherance of the wealth and outward good
estate of another, or others, one or more, are four.

1 Just dealing with another, or others, one or more, in respect of wealth and
outward good things.

2 Yielding help to another, or others, in outward good things, standing in
need of help that way.

3 Procuring the wealth of another, or others, one or more.

4 In restoring things unjustly gotten or taken away from another, or others,
one or more.

Just dealing with another, or others, one or more, in respect of wealth and
outward good things, stands in four things:

First, in a willing yielding of that which is due, to every one bearing office
in the Church, or in the Commonwealth, as Tribute, Custom, Tithes, Tenths,
and such like.

Secondly, in using truth, simplicity, and plainness both in word and deed,
in bargaining, in buying and selling, in hiring and letting.

Thirdly, in keeping of all just and lawful covenants in matter of contract
between person and person, or persons, one or more, as in buying, in selling,
in borrowing, in lending, in hiring, in letting, in pawning, and in taking
things to pawn.

Fourthly, in a ready yielding of that which is due, to any person or persons,
one or more, by way of requital.

In yielding help to another, or others, one or more, in outward things,
standing in need of help that way, stands in two things:

1 In a ready and willing giving.

2 In free lending.

In a ready and willing giving to another, or others, one or more, and
communicating to their necessities in outward things, both to such as are
absolutely poor, whether in common want, or extreme want, and also to those,
who for the present, by reason of some sudden accident, do want and stand in
need of relief, though otherwise of good means: and this communicating to the
necessities of others in outward things, must be with respect,

1 To the state and condition of the parties that stand in need of relief;
releeuing those who are in great need, before those whose wants are but common
and ordinary; and those that are in extreme necessity, though enemies, before
friends and acquaintance, not in like want; and amongst such as are in extreme
necessity, those who are the first cast upon us by the providence of God.

2 To the persons that are to be relieved, the want and necessity of the
persons being alike: first, releeuing those, to whom we are bound by the bond
of blood, kindred, or alliance, and then others; and amongst others, first,
those that are nearer to us in habitation, and then those that are further off;
and amongst those that are either nearer or further off, such especially as are
of the household of faith; and relief must be given liberally according to our
ability, and to the necessities of the receivers, as near as we can.

In free lending to another, or others, one or more, as occasion is offered;
and if the party to whom something is lent, be decayed in his or her outward
estate, by the immediate hand of God, or be brought to extreme poverty in free
forgiving the debt.

The procuring the wealth of another, or others, one or more, stands in three
things:

First, in a wise and discreet undertaking and becoming surety for another,
or others, one or more.

Secondly, in dealing faithfully with the goods of another, or others, one or
more, being trusted with them.

Thirdly, in auerting and turning away harms from the goods of another, or
others, one or more, as occasion is offered.

The restoring of things unjustly gotten or taken away from another, or others,
one or more, stands

In making recompense and satisfaction for things unjustly gotten, or taken
away from another, or others, one or more, which is done by returning to them
either the same things every way as good as they were when they first had them,
with an overplus answerable to the damage they have sustained by the want of
them; or else things of the same kind, every way as good as they were, both
for the quantity, and for the worth and value of them, with so much over and
above, as they have sustained loss or hinderance by the want of them, for the
time they have wanted them.

The end of the eighth Commandment.
The 9. Commandment. The Negative part.
It forbids in general whatsoever is contrary to the truth, and tends to the
hurt or hinderance of the good name of man or woman; and those things are,

Either such things as are contrary to the truth, and tend to the hurt or
hinderance of a man or woman's own good name:

Or such things as are contrary to the truth, and tend to the hurt or
hinderance of the good name of another, or others, one or more.

Such things as are contrary to the truth, and tend to the hurt or hinderance
of a man or a woman's own good name, are either things inward in the heart, or
expressed and uttered by the tongue.

Things inward in the heart, are two things especially.

First, selfe-conceitednesse, and an ouer-weening of their own excellency,
when a man or a woman do think themselves either to be that which they are
not, or are too highly conceited of the good things they have.

Secondly, too base and too mean a conceit, and an vnder-weening of the good
things that be in themselves; when a man or a woman do think that either they
have not that grace, and those good things, or not that measure of grace, and
of good things that indeed they have.

Things expressed and uttered by the tongue, are three things especially:

1 Vainglorious boasting and bragging, which is most vile and odious, when it
is a boasting and bragging of wickedness and sin.

2 The lessening and extenuating of their faults.

3 The unjust accusing of themselves, as by speech, either denying, or
extenuating and lessening the graces and gifts God has bestowed on them.

Such things as are contrary to the truth, and tend to the hurt or hinderance
of the good name of another, or others, one or more, are,

Either things inward in the heart, or expressed and uttered by the tongue.

Things inward in the heart, are four things especially.

1 Light and wrongful suspicion, and evil surmising and causeless misdeeming
of another, or others, one or more, which comes either from their weakness of
judgment, or from their own guiltiness of sin, or from some evil
affection of envy, hatred, or the like.

2 Rash, uncharitable, and unjust judging and condemning of another, or others,
one or more, which is done two ways: Either in respect of their persons, as
when they think otherwise of their persons, than they ought to do, in regard
of some slips, infirmities, evil reports; or in regard of some crosses, or
some strange accident that befalls them: Or in regard of their words or deeds,
as when they think and judge otherwise of their words and deeds, than they
ought to do, as when they think and judge ill of their good speeches or
actions, or do take their speeches or actions that are indifferent in the
worst part, or do think and judge the things that are spoken or done amiss
by them, worse than they are.

3 Inward contemning and thinking basely of another, or others, one or more,
and disdaining of them for worldly respects.

4 Admiring of others, and magnifying of them in the inward conceit of the
heart above their worth, which is most vile and odious, when it is for their
errors and sins.

Things expressed and uttered by the tongue, are either things expressed and
uttered to another, or others, one or more, or things expressed and uttered of
another, or others, one or more.

Things expressed and uttered by the tongue to another, or others, one or more,
are either things uttered vainly or falsely.

Things uttered vainly, are either things uttered without reason, and out of
season, when a man or a woman are pratlers, and too full of words, and do keep
nothing secret, but tell whatsoever they know, and do needlessely publish the
secrets and infirmities of others, to their discredit.

The things uttered falsely, are two especially:

1 Lying, when a man or a woman do willingly and wittingly speak that which
they know is false, with a mind and purpose to deceive, which is most odious,
when it is either to cloak and smooth over a sin already committed, or to
make way for sin and the doing of some evil, or when it is to entrap another,
or others, one or more, and to draw them into some error or sin, or into
some danger.

2 Such speech as sets either praise or dispraise where it should not, and a
man or a woman do praise others to their faces unjustly, by flattering of
them, as when they do to their faces praise, commend, and extol either their
persons, or their gifts, or their actions, above that which they know or
think, either to get favor with them, or some way or other for their own
advantage, which is most odious, when it is with hatred and malice in the
heart, and that flattering is most hurtful and dangerous, which is used in
things that concern the state of the soul. Isai. 5.20. Job 16.20. Job 27.5, 6.
And they do dispraise others to their faces unjustly, when in their speech
uttered to others, they do contrary to their knowledge, and out of envy,
dispraise their persons, or good gifts, or good actions, with a purpose either
to disgrace or to discourage them.

Things expressed and uttered of another, or others, one or more, are either on
the part of the speaker, or on the part of the hearer.

Things expressed and uttered on the part of the speaker, which are speeches
uttered of others, either in private or in public:

In private, and those are either,

In the presence of the party or parties, one or more, of whom they are
spoken, and those are speeches falsely charging some ill on another, or others,
one or more, to their faces, either contrary to knowledge, or on some light
suspicion.

Or behind their backs, and out of their presence, and those are tale-bearing,
backbiting and slandering speeches, and malicious defamations; and men do
carry tales, back-bite and slander, and maliciously defame others, two ways:

1 By whispering ill of them, by rounding in the ear, or ears of such as will
hear them.

2 By speaking ill of them more openly. And the whispering or speaking ill more
openly of others behind their backs, is most vile and odious; when the report
of ill that is either whispered, or spoken more openly, is false, or when it is
colored over with fair pretenses.

In public, and those are either,

In the absence of the party, or parties, one or more, of whom they are
spoken, which are speeches either falsely charging some ill on others behind
their backs, and that either against knowledge, or on some light suspicion, or
truly charging some ill on them behind their backs out of malice, or by some
by-respect, by way of public information, without any calling thereunto.

Or in the presence of the party, or parties, one or more, of whom they are
spoken; and those are speeches uttered in open place of justice and judgment,
falsely charging some ill on others in their presence:

Either by

The Judge or Judges, one or more, in giving false sentence and unjust
judgment against others, being before them to be examined and tried, touching
some matter of crime.

Or by Advocates, Pleaders and Patrons of causes; as speeches uttered by them
in their false and unjust pleading against others, being in some open court to
be examined and tried touching some matter of crime.

Or by Jurors, as speeches uttered by them, in giving up a false and unjust
verdict against others, being in some open court to be examined touching some
matter of crime.

Or by accusers, as speeches uttered by them, whereby they do unjustly and
wrongfully accuse others, being in some open court to be examined and tried
touching some matter of crime.

Or by witnesses, as speeches uttered by them, whereby they do unjustly
testify against others, being in some open court to be examined and tried
touching some matter of crime, which is done three ways:

1 By affirming something as witnesses against others, which they know is
directly and maliciously false.

2 By denying or concealing of something known to themselves to be true, and
which they ought to speak.

3 By affirming something against others, as witnesses, craftily and
deceitfully.

Things uttered and expressed of another, or others, one or more, on the part
of the hearer, which are speeches heard and willingly received, and entertained
by the hearer, or hearers, one or more, being contrary to the truth, and tend
to the hurt or hinderance of the good name of others, of whom they are spoken,
and this is done two ways.

1 By believing and easily giving credit to flying tales and ill reports that
are made of others, not knowing the thing, or things reported to be true, and
thereupon judging amiss of them, or hating them, or contemning them.

2 By hearing of ill reports that are made of others, not knowing the thing or
things reported to be true, yet suspecting them to be false, with patience and
silence, and showing no dislike to them at all, either by countenance, or
speech, or turning away the body, or such like.

And both these are most odious, when the report of ill is against such as are
truly religious, and they are most pernicious, when the report of ill is
believed, or heard, or received with patience, by Magistrates, and by such as
be in authority.

The Affirmative part of the ninth Commandment.
It requires in general whatsoever is agreeable to the truth, and tends to
the help or furtherance of the good name of man or woman, and those things are,

Either such things as are agreeable to the truth, and tend to the help or
furtherance of a man or a woman's own good name:

Or such things as are agreeable to the truth, and tend to the help or
furtherance of the good name of another, or others, one or more.

Those things that are agreeable to the truth, and tend to the help or
furtherance of a man or a woman's own good name, are

Either things inward in the heart:

Or things expressed and uttered by the tongue.

Things inward in the heart, are two things especially.

1 A right judgment and estimation of themselves, and of their own gifts,
neither ouer-weening, nor vnder-weening of them.

2 A love of their own good name, and a care of their credit, expressing that
by all good endeavor to get a good name, and being gotten, to keep it; and if
at any time it be through sin impaired or lost, to recover it.

And a man or a woman must endeavor to get a good name, and having gotten it,
to keep it, by living religiously, embracing the truth of religion in love to
it, and practicing in an holy life sincerely, and without dissimulation,
keeping a narrow watch against every sin, and with an honest and upright
heart, seeking Gods glory in every thing.

And a man or woman is to recover a good name, it being impaired or lost
through sin, by true repentance and unfeigned conversion and turning to God,
and by breaking off that sin, and by testifying the same before men by
amendment of life.

Things expressed and uttered by the tongue are three things especially.

1 A speaking sparingly, and avoiding vain babbling in ordinary communication.

2 A wise and discreet speaking when they have occasion to mention either their
virtues and good things, or their faults and evil things to men. And their
wise and discreet speaking having occasion to mention their virtues and good
things to men, stands in speaking of them with modesty, so as their speech
incline rather to the defect than to the excess, and so as they rather
extenuate them than boast of them.

And their wise and discreet speaking, having occasion to mention their faults
and evil things to men, stands in speaking of their known faults and
corruptions to men, the uttermost they can against themselves, yet so as they
give no suspicion of pride or hypocrisy, and so as they do not disgrace
themselves too much, as they make themselves able to do less good then
otherwise they might, in speaking of their secret faults and corruptions to men
only, when it is fit and meet for them so to do, and that is only in two
cases.

1 In the case of secret offense and wrong done to others. 2 In case of trouble
of mind and conscience, so as it be to such as are able and willing to
comfort and counsel them, and also faithful.
3 A speaking in defense of their own good name when need requires, so as
they do it modestly and willingly.

Such things as are agreeable to the truth, and tend to the help and
furtherance of another or others, one or more, are either things inward in the
heart, or things expressed and uttered by the tongue.

Things inward in the heart are three especially.

1 A charitable opinion and estimation of others, and a thinking the best of
things said or done by them, and a taking of them in good part, so far as
truth and reason will give leave.

2 A true love, and an hearty wel-wishing to the good name of another or
others, one or more, which may be known by two things.

1 By rejoicing for their credit and good estimation, they knowing them on good
grounds, to be in good credit, and in good estimation. 2 By grieuing when they
know they deserve discredit and disgrace, and do hear a true report of some
ill spoken or done by them, whereby they are justly blemished, and their
reputation justly diminished.
3 A stayednesse of judgment, touching ill reports that are made of others,
not knowing the thing or things reported to be true.

Things expressed and uttered by the tongue, are either things expressed and
uttered to another or others, one or more;

Or of another or others one or more.

Things expressed and uttered to another or others, one or more, are two things
especially:

1 A speaking of the truth from the heart simply and plainly, and as it ought
to be spoke, with good affection, and with a loving heart, with an intent and
desire to do good in the speaking of it, and seasonably, a man or a woman
having a calling to speak it.

2 A wise and discreet speaking to others for their good, as just occasion is
offered, which stands in two things:

1 In giving them whatsoever advice and counsel in matters of doubt, and in
directing them in the way of God, and exhorting and stirring them up to walk
therein in love and wisdom.

2 In giving them sound and seasonable admonition, and just reproof for their
known faults and offenses in love and wisdom.

Things expressed and uttered of another or others, one or more, are:

Either on the part of the speaker,

Or on the part of the hearer.

Things expressed and uttered of another or others, one or more, on the part of
the speaker, are:

Either in private.

Or in public.

Things expressed or uttered of another or others in private, are two things
especially:

1 A free acknowledging of the good gifts of God in others, and of the good
things said or done by them, and a speaking of them to their praise and
commendation, so as it be in fit time and place, as rather in their absence
than in their presence, and in a right manner, and with moderation, giving them
only due praise and commendation, and so as they do not thereby approve of
the least of their sins.

2 A speaking in defense of the good name of others, when they are in our
hearing, and to our knowledge traduced and slandered, and ill reported of
unjustly, especially behind their backs.

Things expressed and uttered of another or others, one or more, in public,
are:

Either by such as sit as Judges in some open place:

Or by such as are Advocates, or Jurors.

By such as sit as Judges in some open place of justice and judgment, and
those are two things especially.

1 The absoluing and acquitting of such as come before them, and after due
examination and trial, touching some matter of crime laid against them, are
found guiltless, and the pronouncing of them innocent, and free from the
crimes falsely objected against them.

2 A due encouragement of such as are before them and on some just occasion are
made known to them to be honest and good, and to deserve well, and a giving of
them due praise and commendation for their well doing.

Or by such as are lawfully called to speak in some open place of justice and
judgment, as Advocates, or as Jurors, or as Witnesses, which are speeches
uttered by them in defense of the good name of others, and for the clearing of
their innocence when they are in their hearing, and to their knowledge openly
wronged and falsely accused of some crime.

Things that are uttered and expressed by another, or others, on the part of
the hearer, are two especially:

First, a ready receiving of the good report that is made of another or
others, one or more, so far as truth and reason will give leave.

Secondly, a showing dislike of whisperers and tale-bearers, either by
countenance, or by speech, or by gesture, and such like; especially by
Magistrates and such as be in any place of authority and superiority.

The end of the ninth Commandment.
The 10. Commandment. The Negative part.
It forbids in general two things:

1 The pronenesse and inclination of our corrupt nature to evil, whereby a man
or a woman is naturally prone to think, will, or affect any thing that is
forbidden in the Law of God, and contrary to the true love of God or man: and
this pronenesse and inclination to evil, is in every man and woman descended
from Adam by natural generation.

2 The effects and fruits of the pronenesse and inclination of our corrupt
nature to evil, which are inward in the soul, and those effects are two
especially:

1 Evil and inordinate concupiscence, every motion, even the first motion,
coming from the rebellion of nature, whereby we are stirred up to evil, and
do with delight think any thing contrary to the true love of God or man,
though we never give consent of will to commit that evil.

2 A suffering our selves to be infected with those motions, that Satan or
evil men do put into our minds, contrary to the true love of God or man, by
yielding to them, and delighting in them, and having our hearts tickled with
delight in them.

The Affirmative part of the tenth Commandment.
It requires two things in general:

1 Original purity in all the powers and faculties of the soul, and an holy
disposition and inclination of the soul, whereby a man or woman is at all
times disposed to think, will, and affect that which the law of God requires,
and is agreeable to the true and perfect love of God and men.

2 The inward effects and fruits of original purity in the soul, and of an
holy disposition and inclination of the soul of man, and those effects are two:

1 Good and holy motions of the mind and will, whereby we are stirred up to
good things, and do with delight think and will that which is agreeable to
the true love God and man.

2 A suppressing of evil thoughts, and motions to evil, whether coming from
the flesh within, or from Satan and evil men without, and a keeping them from
taking any place in our minds, by the least assent to them, or the least
delight in them.

(...).
