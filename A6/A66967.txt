CONSIDERATIONS Exciting to HOLY LIVING.
1 Concerning our present and future Condition.
I. Concerning our present, and future, Condition, Consider

1. OUR future Condition immutable, and eternal.

2. Our present, very short in nature; by casualties yet shorter. (Hoc modicum
longum nobis videtur, quoniam adhuc agitur; cum finitum fuerit, tunc sentiemus,
quam modicum fuerit.)

3. Death ordinarily seizing us at such a time, when less, than at other,
expected ( Luke 12.38, 39, 40. Matt. 25.5. -- 24.50.44. -- Rev. 3.3. -- Eccl.
9.12. -- Luke 21.35. 1 These. 5.2, 3. -- Luke 17.26.28. Jam. 4.13, 14.) And the
most of men suddenly carried away hence; not by the decays of old age, but some
accidental Distemper, or mischance. See the larger Meditations on Death below,.
170.

4. That eternal Estate depending on our ordering this momentany.

5. The Sufferings of the present, not worthy to be compared with the
Felicities to come; nor with the Torments.

6. The Pleasures of the present, not worthy to be compared with the Sufferings
to come; nor with the Pleasures.

II. Concerning the Condition of all present things about us.
II. Concerning the condition of all present things about us. Consider

1. The good things of this world, 1 attained with much trouble (which is many
times also destitute of success.) 2 Very fleeting; in no one moment exactly
like themselves in another; and not at all certainly enjoyed. [Here meditate on
the temporal Crosses of the greatest, and happiest of men; David (considering
his many Psalms of complaint:) Solomon (considering the Confessions of
Ecclesiastes:) Ezechias; Josias; Constantine; Augustus, etc. And that all
Conditions are equally liable to the greatest, and intimatest, of evils; (i.
e.) Sickness.]

2. The enjoyment no way satisfying; not only vanity in them, but vexation.
Ecclesiastes 1.26.

3. Though never so satisfying; yet many of them forbidden by our Maker, and
not to be enjoyed without sin. [The end of our, and their, Creation not being
our present happiness in a full indulgement of them: but, in the use only of
such as are necessary and allowed, and in our subjection to many strict Laws
and great Temptations, and constant service and worship of our Creator here;
and, hereafter, an eternal Fruition of him.]

4. Those that may be, without sin, enjoyed; yet many of them hindrances to
our future happiness, and tempting to sin; and, ordinarily, our pleasure not to
be had, both here, and hereafter.

5. Lastly Consider; how few those pleasures, and how momentany that time, will
appear, upon your sad Deathbed, with which you have bargained for eternal
pains ( Ecclesiasticus 11.27.) and how sweet and gentle those commands, and how
short the time of your restraint by them, by which you might have gained
eternal felicity.

III. Concerning the unreasonableness, and hurt, of Sin.
III. Concerning the unreasonableness, and hurt of Sin. Consider

1. The great unreasonableness of sin; and the constant opposition it has,
both to the public, and to a man's private, natural good. Or, That all
things,naturally, and in the judgment of right reason, good for man are by the
supreme Lawgiver allowed, and only things naturally, as we are men, hurtful,
prohibited.

2. The chief Causes of Sin

1. External: The Devil, and the evil Spirits his Angels, enemies to man.

Digr. Of the great malice, and power of Satan, intervening in humane affairs
in general; and of the incessant temptations and suggestions of evil Spirits to
the production of Sin, circumeuntes, and quaerentes, quem devorent.

3. 2ly, Internal: The sensitive part disobedient and rebellious to the
rational.

Digr. Of the great power and the many ways that the sensitive faculties have
in perverting reason for the production of Sin.

4. The Antecedent of a sinful Act, the torment of an inordinate desire.

5. The great trouble, and servitude, that is under Sin.

6. The Consequents of Sin.

1. Either Inquietude of Conscience; Or (which is worse) a dangerous blindness
of mind, and hardness of Heart, within.

7. 2ly, Stronger Delusion (by God's Grace abandoning us to the will of Satan)
from abroad: And so, the Curse of Sin still more Sin.



9. Some naturally caused by the Sin; Among these, Sickness; a shortened life;
Infamy; Poverty; Quarrels; Disconsolation, and Despair.



11. Inflicted upon many Generations, one, for the sins of another; God using,
besides those on private persons, Inquisitions ( Ps. 9.12.) and Judgments, more
public, (at pre-appointed times,) on families, on nations, wicked.

12. These public Judgments returning ordinarily once in three or four
Generations, upon the disobedient ( Exodus 20.5.34.7;) for God's Eternity, and
exceeding patience, makes not such have, as we.

13. Then, These Judgments extending further than Man's Justice does; 1st. For
the Sufferers; namely to Relatives, in that particular sin not faulty; to
Children; to Buildings etc; And 2ly further than man's, for the Crimes also,
that such persons are charged with; namely, for those of many Predecessors; for
God's hand is heavier than man's.

14. Punishing, 1st, the Crimes, (if very grievous,) of the Fathers (though
they become afterward penitent, and received into favor) upon their Posterity
wicked, or other Relatives. As appears in Manasseh. 2. Chron. 33.10, 13. -- 2.
King. 24.3, 4. And in David. 2. Sam. 24, 17.

15. 2ly, The Crimes of sinning Parents upon Posterity innocent of such Crimes
(though not every way righteous Ezech. 18.14. 2. Sam. 21.1.14. -- 2. Sam.
12.18.) But never this in the same measure, as he does on a wicked Progeny. See
Ezech. 18. chap.

16. Using ordinarily the more wicked, his Instruments, to punish the less.

17. The first, and more, in Grace when lapsed, the first, and more, in
punishment.

18. Punishing men for their guilt in one thing, by another thing, wherein they
are innocent; or involving those in the same punishments, who are innocent, as
to that common guilt, for which he punishes the rest.

19. Punishing also the Instruments of his Justice, and of his punishments,
(they executing them most what unjustly;) and punishing also the Rejoycers at
his punishments.

20. In equal guilt, punishing some, not others. Lu. 13.2.4.

21. In unequal guilt, punishing all alike; yet not this by punishing any
beyond, but only some less than, their desert.

22. Punishing, at certain times only the sins of many times; and sometimes the
less wicked age, for the sins of the more wicked.

23. Not excusing sin the more, when grown to general custom, as man does; but
ordinarily then his wrath breaking forth upon it, when the commonness makes it
seem no fault; and so when the Sinners least fear, or think of wrath. Our sins
appearing greatest to him, when least to our selves.

24. Punishing in such set places, universally, the less faulty there, as the
more; whilst at the same time elsewhere people more faulty enjoy impunity; and
yet the Lord, in all these punishments, most righteous; since, of these, the
more guilty are always punished much under, the less guilty never beyond, their
demerits; their Demerits I say, in some other, if not in the same, kind.

25. Inflicted, not according to the estimation, which man, the Offender,
makes of his sin; but which God the Judge, who reckons many very heinous,
which the other accounts very small; and all sins in general far more sinful,
than man does; He looking on the heart, and discovering its malice, and
hypocrisy, more perfectly, than the sinner himself does; beholding all sins
past, as present, and always before him, whilst to the sinner himself many are
never known, many, once known, quite forgotten. Again; He, as being the person
wronged by sin, who is always a higher valuer of the offense, than is the party
offending, justly aggravating it, from the supreme dignity of his person; his
infinite love, and numberless benefactions to the Sinner: his former long
patience toward Him; his exceeding holiness, and purity so opposite to its
filthiness, etc. See Genesis 6.6. Where it is said: That man's sin grieved him at
his heart, and it repented our Lord, that ever he had made him on the earth. --
And again: Mar. 3.5. That our most meek Lord Jesus was so provoked by it, That
he looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of
their hearts. But especially the hainousness of sins may be learnt from the
many experienced stupendous Judgments upon them, at which man is much
troubled, how to make them bear any just proportion to his Faults.

Which dreadful revenges upon Sin you may consider; 1. In the fallen Angels for
one sin exiled from heaven, and held in chains of darkness near upon ever since
the Creation of the world, besides what is to come; made also for ever
incapable of any means of Reconciliation. 2. In Adam; for one sin, ejected out
of his most pleasant Habitation; apparrel'd with the covering of Beasts;
condemned to eat his Bread in labor, and sorrow, and penance, for near a 1000
years, and then to return to Putrefaction, and a curse laid on all his
Posterity, and on the ground they lived on, for his sake. 3. In the drowning at
one time, for their lusts, and oppressions, of all the men in the world (except
Eight persons) their children, and infants, and all other living creatures, for
their sake. 4. In the storm of Fire and Brimstone, rained upon the five Cities
for their Lusts; and those pleasant Plains turned to a dead Lake, till this
day; and yet these Cities to undergo a new Damnation at the day of Judgment, as
if they had as yet suffered nothing. See Mat. 11.22. Where our Lord,
aggravating the punishment of Bethsaida, says, it shall be then more
intolerable than that of Sodom. 5. In the severe punishments of David, though
otherwise a most holy person; the sad story of which you may read in the 13.15.
and 24. Chapters of 2. Sam. Concerning all which forenamed punishments, this is
a sufficient evidence, that the sins deserved them, because he, who is Justice
it self, and from whom man learns the true notions of it, inflicted them. 6.
Lastly. In the precious Sacrifice of the only Son of God, required by his
Father for the Expiation of Sin. This of the present temporal punishments. But
then consider also,



27. 1 Immediately after death; Of the Soul. Exemplified, in the deceased rich
man, tormented in fire, whilst his brethren yet living, in their jollity here
on earth, Luke 16.24. And, in the Beast, and false Prophet their being cast
into the Lake of fire before the Invasion of Gog, and Magog, and before Satan's
being shut up there. See Rev. 19, 20. Comp. 20.8.10. Which also appears from
our Lord's declaring, that a temporal death kills the Body but not the Soul:
Matt. 10.28. And St. Pet. 1. Ep. 3, 4. advises the adorning of the hidden man
of the heart, because this not corruptible: And Ibid. ver. 19. makes mention of
Spirits in Prison; viz. the spirits of such persons as were preached-to in the
days of Noah. And if the Souls of the Righteous be then presently in Paradise,
Luke 23.43. and with Christ their Lord, and partake of God's mercy, and glory;
the Souls of the Wicked must be then presently imprisoned, and remain with the
Devil their Master, feel the lashes of God's Justice, and begin their never
ending misery, and ignominy; Whilst the Body descends into the Grave, the poor
Soul, by the strength of Angels, being forced downward into a far lower
Dungeon, an infernum inferius, in the most innermost bowels of the earth; from
whence it shall never return again, nor see light; save, at the last day, that,
which flasheth from the face of the angry Judge, when it is brought to his Bar
to receive its last doom, doubled torments; and, to make it much more sensible
of them, forced to take along with it its loathed Mate the Body, into the same
profound pit. Who then can tell the agony of such person now come to the end of
his days; when scorched with Fevers, he desires to dye; and, by death can
remove only into a bed of fire; when he cannot endure his present pains, and
has no change, save to far greater; these he cannot suffer, and the other, if
ceasing to suffer these, he can no way avoid; nor knows he what way to turn
himself, in this Labyrinth of Despairs? These sufferings of the Soul having
been by some endured already above 5000 years: and those of the rich glutton in
flames (if this not made wholly a Parable) suffered now above sixteen
Centuries, though he lived here not one.

28. 2 After Doomsday; Of Soul and Body. Where also weigh well the terrible
description of these punishments mentioned in his Word who cannot lie. The Body
raised in dishonor; -- A Carcass, deformed, stinking; Chains; binding hand and
foot; Prison; depth of the Earth; Dungeon; Bottomless Pit; A Fire -- and
Brimstone-Lake; Immobility; Suffocation; Worm, or Serpent gnawing; Fire
devouring; Thirst never refreshed; Body never consumed; Sense never stupefied;
Weeping, wailing, gnashing the teeth; Society of wicked men and Devils; ugly,
stinking; All hating, cursing, one another; hating, cursing, God; cast into a
land of Oblivion, Psalm. 88.12. None to comfort, none to bemoan; The ancient
Compassion of Saints, and Angels, and God, now turned into Hate, and Derision;
No Mediator, no Redeemer; The Soul always in an Agony and sick to death;
restless, hopeless, despairing; wounded to the heart with the sense of lost
happiness, as well as present misery: And all her sufferings eternal, eternal.
Eternal these pains; God, in his upright Justice, not being so indulgent as to
grant to that his wretched Creature the relief of an Annihilation. And these
pains unremitting; the rich man sparingly begging of the beggar, that before
wanted his relief, but only one drop of water, falling from the dipped tip of
his finger ( Luke 16.24.) and it would not be granted him. The greatness of
God's vengeance then answering the greatness of his person, and of his patience
(when yet, for the present, so much hating sin): which Patience, abused, at
last turns to Fury; and no wrath comparable to the wrath of the Lamb. (See Rev.
6.6. -- Romans 2.5.) And, from the magnitude of this wrath and punishment is
chiefly learnt the magnitude of sin; and what a Monster that must be, that
deserves such Torments for ever and ever, from him that cannot do the least
Injustice.

Digr. Of the Degrees of future Torments, * according to the several measures
of sin here ( Matt. 10.15.) * According to the measures of sinful pleasures
enjoyed here ( Rev. 18.7. -- Luke 16.25.) * According to the greater knowledge
of God's will here ( Luke 12.4.47, 48.)

29. After all that is said; seriously imagine, What one of those poor Souls,
released from Hell Torments, would do, not to return again to those intolerable
pains: what rigid long Penances he would undergo: what great works of Piety and
Devotions he would attempt; what a strict watch he would keep over his words,
and thoughts; and, after all think this nothing in comparison of such a
deliverance. And then do you endeavor to do the like mortification, (who
perhaps are a greater Sinner,) to prevent those pains, and secure your future
Condition. The unreasonableness, and hurt of Sin, thus, seriously pondered;

IV. Concerning the difficulty of Repentance.
IV. Next; Concerning Repentance and its Difficulties.

Consider,

1. 1 Its Inferiority to innocence; And 2 the great advantages of early Piety.

2. Wicked actions of the afterward penitent, though not condemning us, yet 1
Diminishing our future happiness: ( i.e. the more clear Vision, and the more
perfect fruition, of that which we then shall most ardently love; or (if you
will) the more ardent love of that which is supremely amiable;) 2 Hindering
(for the present) the larger donations and consolations of the Spirit.

3. The folly of sinning, because of a cure; which will be so bitter, if
effectual.

4. The uncertainty of attaining Repentance, and converting unto God, at what
time we shall desire it; Forgiveness being promised to Repentance; But not so,
longer life, or in it the Grace of Repentance, to a Sinner. And, this supposed
that the Elect cannot finally fall away; yet not any sure (but only by
perseverance, or extraordinary Revelation) that they are of that number, since
many believers are not so. Jam. 2.14.19, 20. -- Matt. 25.44. In illum
crediderunt; Bona operari non curaverunt. St. Austine, De Fide and Oper. cap.
15.

5. The uncertainty, afterward, of our having performed it sufficiently.

6. Upon continuance in sin, still more difficulty of Repentance; sin
habituated growing much stronger.

7. And less care also of Repentance; as a sin is more frequented, so it
appearing lesser.

8. And sins of Malice (which by the Judgment of God do darken the heart) being
followed with sins of Ignorance: And then; this not-knowing that we sin utterly
barring up all way to repentance. ( Jer. 2.35.)

9. And so much sorer Repentance, penances, humiliations, tears, etc. to be
performed for a longer, and increased guilt; and for the delay also of
Repentance.

10. The time of an acceptable Repentance perhaps to some, tho none can know to
whom, expired before this life be so. For which at your leisure consider these
Texts. Heb. 3.11. -- 6.4. -- 10.26. -- 12.16, 17. -- Luke 19.42. -- Matt.
12.42. -- Jo. 5.14. -- 12.39, 40. -- Apocal. 16.9.11. -- Job. 27.9. -- 35.12,
13. -- Prove. 1.24.28. -- 28.9. -- Es. 1.15. -- Jer. 11.11. -- 14.12. Ezech.
8.18. -- Zeph. 2.2. -- 2. Chron. 36.16. -- Esaias 6.9, 10.55.6. -- Psalm. 18.41.
-- Psalm. 32.6. -- Eccles. 9.12. -- Jer. 14.10: -- Ezech. 14.13, 14. -- Zechar.
7.13. -- 2. King. 22.16. etc. -- 23.25, 26, 27. [ Josiah's Prayers, and
Reformation, not countervailing Manasses his sins: Manasses, tho a Penitent; 2.
Chron. 33.12. etc.] -- Hos. 9.7. -- 5, 6. -- Matt. 13.15. -- 21.19. -- 25.10,
11. -- Luke 13.24, 25. -- 12.58. -- 19.42. -- 21.35. -- Jo. 8.21. -- 2. Pet.
2.20. -- 1. These. 2.13.16. -- The Case of Cain, Genesis 4.13. -- Of Saul, 1. Sam.
15.24. -- 30, 31. -- 1. Cor. 9.24. Some Runners losing the Race, 2. Tim. 2.5.
Some Combatants losing the Crown. It may be some or other of these Texts, God's
Grace cooperating, may prevail with you for an early Reformation, for fear of
a later fruitless Repentance.

11. And they at last abandoned, and condemned to more sins as the punishment
of former. Act. 7.42. Romans 1.24. Hence

12. Later Repentance, less hopeful.

13. And, from little hopes of forgiveness, there growing more hardheartedness
in sinning.

14. After Repentance, If there happens a relapse to the same degree of sinning
as formerly, this Estate far worse than (before) that of the Impenitent was;
Either the guilt of former sin, upon relapse, as some say, returning; or rather
the very guilt of the relapse so much more aggravated from former sin forgiven.

15. Lastly, That a true and effectual Repentance is (where death prevents
not,) nothing else, but a sincere Reformation of life; and actual walking in
Holiness and Righteousness all our days. Together with a continual voluntary
Contrition (looking back to our former sinful life): Contrition both interior
and exterior, joined together (in forbearing things delightful, and in
practicing things painful, to the flesh, and to nature, (Corpo voto, Anima
desolata.)

Digr. 1. Of the severe Penitences done in the Primitive Church.

2. Recommendation of doing voluntary public Penance.

3. That the fear of God's Justice, and doubtfulness of his forgiveness, either
of the eternal, or also temporal punishments, (for sins committed after
Baptism,) is the chiefest promoter of the painful humiliations of Repentance.
And, presumption of the certainty of our Salvation, or of the divine mercy
either general to all, or particular to us (when such sinners,) by some
miscalled Faith, is the greatest hindrance thereof. Qui a peur, il est asseur.

.5.
Par. 1. V. Concerning the Measure of this Reformation.
V. Concerning the measure of this Reformation. Consider

1. The strictness of the last Judgment; not only concerning our Works, but
Words, and Thoughts, where there has been here no after-penitence for, and
Reformation from them: More especially, concerning the employment of our
abilities, and the Duties of our Profession, or calling. ( Luke 19.13. --
12.42, 43. -- Matt. 25.15.30. -- Matt. 20.8. -- Luke 16.2.) And concerning our
deeds of charity, and mercy. -- ( Matt. 25.42. -- 16.9, 10. Matt. 10.42. --
Luke 16.25. Comp. 21.)

2. And the severity thereof: The Lord Jesus then coming as with great power,
and glory, ( Matt. 24.30.) so in great wrath: to take vengeance on the
disobedient to his Gospel, etc. 2. These. 1.7, 8. -- Rev. 6.16. -- n. 18.

3. The Paucity of the saved, and, even of those, who profess Christianity; but
by their own default (man being a creature endued with free will that so his
actions might be capable of punishment, and reward,) Many called but few
chosen; and many more condemned by God's Justice, than saved by his Mercy.
Concerning this weigh well our Lord's Answer, to the Question asked him, If few
saved. Luke 13.23. That the Gate of Salvation is strait; and that many shall
seek to enter in, and shall not be able [ i. e. seek too late, when the Gate is
shut.] There is a Time then, it seems, when the Gate shall be shut upon us,
after which shutting, we in vain seek the opening of it, See. 4. n. 10. [As he
tells the Jews also, Jo. 7.34. and 8.21, That they should seek him, and yet dye
in their sins, because come too late.] But though many seek to enter in, that
shall not; yet perhaps the most may enter in still? Therefore see the Question
answered yet more punctually, in Mat. 7.13, 14. Strait the Gate, narrow the
way, and few that find it; Few that enter in at it. But that may be meant in
comparison of Heathens, and Infidels? No. Matt. 22.14. Of those that are called
[ i. e. of Christians] few chosen. To which add what is said by the Apostle, 1.
Cor. 1. Not many wife after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, chosen.
And particularly concerning rich men, by reason of the many, partly
temptations, partly secular cares thereof, what is said by our Lord, Matt.
19.23. Verily I say unto you, a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom
of God: An easier matter for a Camel to go through a Needle's eye: which yet
with God is a thing possible.

4. The Messiah his first coming into the world, for judgment as well as for
mercy; and to require a more diligent observance of God's Commandments, than
was yielded in former ages.

In which Observance, Consider

5. 1. The necessity (that we attain Salvation) of not living in the custom
and habit of any one great, or mortal, sin whatever; and the certain damnation
that is from them, if unquitted before our death. 1. Cor. 6.9. Ephesians. 5.5, 6.

Digr. How habits may be discerned. Chiefly by the frequency, facility, and
much delight taken, in the Acts.

2. Some Reluctance to sin, (which is in all men from nature, less or more);
and so long, as, notwithstanding this, we act it, no sufficient ground of
hoping pardon.

. 5.
Par. 2.
Digr. An Explication of the seventh Chapter to the Romans; That it must
necessarily be understood, either as describing the condition of a person as
yet irregenerate, and so as yet out of the State of Salvation: One, that is
awakened indeed by the knowledge of the Law, either written, or that of nature;
but yet has received no ability from Grace to keep it. In whom, therefore, is
a striving between the sensitive appetite, and reason, or the mind; their mind
necessarily (by reason of the Light and Law of Nature, or of the Law written,
being not quite darkened in the Soul) dictating contrary to their practice. So
that they may rightly be said to follow their lusts with some unwillingness,
and against their mind. But, in this strife, either reason, the better part, is
not exactly rectified, and consentient to the law of God, or of Nature, (as
appears in those Heathens, who seem to have followed it, yet have not been
excused from sin:) or else at least no power they have to shake off the bands
of their lusts, and follow their Reason, when right, being destitute of grace.
See Romans 8.7, 8. So, every one has, less, or more, ( Romans 2.15.) an inward man
warring against the law of his members, by which mind also he serves, i. e.
delights in, the law of God; consenting unto it, that it is good; and so hating
that evil, which the tyranny and power of the habit of sin ruling in him
forces him still to practice; (which are the Expressions in this Chapter.)
Such was her case in the Tragedy, Video meliora proboque. Such the Heathens,
Romans 2.15. Such the Jews, Romans 10.2. -- 2.17, 18. Such St. Paul's, when a
Pharisee, Act. 22.3. -- Gal. 1.14. -- Romans 8.3. And this Interpretation seems
more proper to the place, than to expound it of the State of the Regenerate: as
may be seen by comparing the contradictions between some passages in this 7th
Chapter, and others in the 5th, 6th, and 8th Chapters, where the State of the
Regenerate is described: as the contradiction between Romans 7. chap. 14. ver.
and 8. chap. 9. ver. between 7.24. and 7.6.6.6. -- between 7.23.7.5. and 8.2,
3, 4. -- 5.15. -- 6.2.14. -- between 7.25.18. and 6.13.12.1; and therefore
these Texts speak not of the same, but several, persons.

. 5.
Par. 3.
Or,if this Chapter be understood as describing the State of the Regenerate, it
must be explained, as speaking only, of lesser sins of Infirmity, which all the
Regenerate, less or more, remain still liable to; or, of Concupiscence still
remaining, as St. Austine expounds it; but this Concupiscence not consented-to,
as to the committing of any great, or mortal Sin. (See St. Austine, Contraduas
Epistolas Pelagii 1. l. 10. chapter -- In Jo. Tract. 41. De Tempore Sermon. 43.) For
there is indeed a strife in the Regenerate also; and this not only between
their appetite, and reason; but between their appetite, or flesh, and the
spirit of Grace; and this, sometimes, to the doing evil, what they would not;
and to the committing of sins of Infirmity. (See Jam. 3, 2. -- 1. Jo. 1.8. --
Gal. 5.17. in the reformed Translation [so that ye cannot do] but the Original
is [so that ye do not do the things that ye would]:) Sometimes and most
frequently, to the doing good so, as according to the Spirit, they would not;
that is, to have their actions mixed with some imperfection and faultiness. (See
Jam. 3.2. -- 1. Jo. 1.8.); Either peccant in the Substance, or in some
Circumstance, or in some mixture of a contrary velleity, Gal. 5.17. But the
Expressions of this Chapter may not be applied to the Regenerate's committing,
or consenting to, any greater sin, whilst they remain Regenerate, and still in
the friendship and favor of God, or have any more than sins of only totally
unavoidable Infirmity. This Digression I have made to prevent the patronizing
of your faults under the imagined like failings of an Apostle. But, that if you
find the law in your members so powerful as to produce your commission of, or
consent to, any greater sin, you may, as suspecting such a condition not good,
make all have to change it, till you resemble the Apostle, not in the 7th Chap.
Romans but in the 8th. -- ver. 2, etc.

3. Not doing evil, no service rewardable. Where remember these Texts: -- Matt.
25.41, 42. Depart from me ye Cursed; [the Reason] For I was an hungered and ye
gave me no meat; naked, and ye clothed me not, etc. Matt. 3.10. Every Tree
which [not only brings evil, or none, but] brings not forth good, fruit,
shall be cast into the Fire. Matt 25.24. etc. Then he which had received the
one Talent came and said; Lord, lo there thou have what is thine. His Lord
answered; Thou slothful servant etc. Take the talent from him; and cast the
unprofitable servant into outward durkness.

and diligent practice of holy Duties, and good works which are required of you.

Digr. Of the Reward its being promised to good works.







7. To make our good works acceptable, there must be innocence from other sins.

8. The inutility also (as for attaining eternal life,) of good works (as of
loving, giving alms etc. where mutual; lending to be paid again, etc;) Or of
acts of virtue; if done only out of some motives of reason; and not out of the
love, and to the honor, of God; and in obedience to his commanding them; and
out of love to Christ, and to his Church, or Members: (As if we said before
every action of ours [this I do for God's, this for Christ's sake]). See Phil.
3.6. comp. 9. -- 1. Cor. 13.3. -- Romans 2.14, 15. comp. 3.9. -- Jo. 3.5, 6. Non
collocatur inter fideles propter opus suum, qui, naturali bono motus, facit
bonum, non propter Deum.

This (right) end especially showed in actions contrary to our own present good.

9. The necessity of our improving the several particular talents, and gifts
received from God, in bringing forth fruits proportionable, for which gifts we
must certainly give account ( Matt. 23.30. Luke 16.2.)

10. The necessity of Perseverance in well-doing, and the lapsibility of all
conditions.

11. The necessity of not deserting any part of our duty for any (opposed)
sufferings; which as they are provided by God for exercising our Virtue, so are
they to be willingly undergone; and not we at any time for them to dispense
with any part of our obedience.

12. That all Christians in the happiest temporal Condition, at all times, one
way, or other, are to undergo some Crosses, if they will not yield unto sin.

13. The Example of our Savior, and of the Saints, in walking in all God's
Commandments, and cheerfully undergoing all opposition for it. Psalm. 18.21.
etc. comp. 1. King. 14.8. Isa. 38.3. Neh. 8.19. -- 2. Tim. 4.7. Job. 13.10, 11,
12. comp. Job. 1.8. Lu. 1.6. Act. 23.1. -- 24.16.

VI. Concerning the Reasonableness, and Benefits of Holiness.
VI. Concerning the Reasonableness, and Benefits of the Service of God, and of
Holiness.

Consider,

1. Our Obligation to this Service.

1 In Duty to God.

Where Consider,

1. The obedience we owe to God's supreme power, and dominion. 2. The love, to
his transcendent amiableness, and perfections. 3. The gratitude, to his
multiplied mercies: (Our Creation, Redemption, continued Providence in all our
Affairs, our unexpressible dependence on him in our Being, Working, etc.) 4.
God's Majesty: to be contemplated in the several appearances of it, (to Moses,
Esaias, Daniel, St. Paul, St. John. Rev. 1. chap.) 5. God's Wisdom: Especially
to be admired, In his conducting all things (from the beginning) still to more
perfection; In his always bringing good out of evil; In his ordering all the
particular affairs of the world, and of every man therein (through the greatest
seeming casualties) in a symmetry as perfect, and exact, to his own Just ends,
could we entirely discover, and compare all the causes, and effects, as that
which we see in the wonderful natural Fabric of all the parts of the world,
and of every man ( Psalm. 107.42, 43.) ( It a magnus in maximis, ut non minor in
minimis.) All which works of his Providence and Conduct, at the great day of
the consummation of all things, his wisdom shall review, and pronounce of
them, as of those of the Creation ( Genesis 1.31.) valde bonn. And then all his
admiring Saints reiterate this Confession to Him, Valde bona, Valde bona. 6.
The excessive, and appearingly-causeless, Love of God to man. 1. In several
degrees, the Savior of all men. 2. Patient, and long suffering, toward
Sinners. 3. Showing Mercy, and pity, according to the creatures greater
impotency and misery. 4. Rewarding to us the good he produces in us.

. 7.
2 In duty to our Selves.

1. The great reasonableness, 2
and amiableness of God's Service, and of living in all Christian virtue, and
holiness. [Ratio perfecta, virtus vocatur.] As (when we look with indifferency
on another man, where Passion swayeth not our Judgment) what a sweetness,
decency, honorableness, and heavenly peace and tranquillity do we judge to be in
patience, compared to blood-thirsty revenge? In meeekness, in respect of
peevish anger and frowardness? In humility, in regard of scornful pride and
restless ambition? In liberality, compared to sordid niggardize? In charity,
compared with lean envy? In sobriety, in respect of beastly and rotten
intemperance. How divine a thing, a Republic of men, all entirely honoring,
and obeying their Superiors, who command them still in Charity; intimatly
loving, and in respect preferring one another; some patient in poverty; others
charitable in wealth; when any sick, all hasting to serve; when poor, to
relieve; when sad, to comfort him; all holy, just, chaste, temperate, etc. In
comparison of a tumult of idle, drunken, debauched, and sottish persons; loving
only from the teeth outward; railing at, backbiting, scorning one another;
catching at one another wealth; supplanting one another preferments; tempting
one another wives; plotting treasons against their Governors; lastly such, as
are described Romans 1.29.?

2. Far less trouble, and more freedom in it, than in Sin (Par mundus dat
onus, gravinsque:) The Acts thereof leaving behind them a singular delight in
the Soul; as those of Sin, great after-disgust and discontent: Virtue pleasing
much better after; sin, before, it is committed. Only, in such virtuous
practice, and in every good work, small or great, almost always a little pain
felt for a while in the beginning; and this to make it more rewardable.

3. The great Reward of it.

8.
1 For the present. 1. Tim. 4.8.

1. A present union of us with Christ and God by the same holy Spirit dwelling
in both, 1
and quenching the thirst to all worldly things; ( Jo. 4.14.) Former sensual
pleasures, to one acquainted with holiness (when he again happens upon them) no
more seeming what precious things they were, but such as to a man do the sports
of children, contemptible; or also to the more confirmed, odious. Quas Sordes
suggerebant, quae dedecora, said St. Austine reformed, of his former sensual
delights.

2. Extraordinary illuminations, and consolations from this Spirit, especially
in the time of necessity, in extraordinary poverty, afflictions, persecutions;
and the excess of joy in the mind rendering little-perceived the pain of sense:
1. These. 1.6. -- 2. Cor. 6.10. -- 2. Cor. 4.8, 9. only, as it were, afflicted,
poor, sorrowful, dying; but, indeed, always rejoicing, rich, possessing all
things.

3. Contentedness in all conditions, as being always, and certainly possessed
of that, which he only or chiefly loves. Jo. 16.22. Jer. 6.16. Matt. 11.29.
Phil. 4.7. And for other things less considerable, partly by his submission, in
many of them, as purely indifferent to God's will; partly by God's
condescending in many other unto his. (See Psalm. 4.3.) Seldom having occasion
of discontent. Genesis 24.1.

4. Tranquillity of mind, and joy of conscience, for past actions, and for doing
good; which joy (though serious) is very great. And, as they do greater good,
so still greater consolations accompanying it.

5. Joy of (mostwhat) attaining their desires, and ends, because these honest,
spiritual, following the divine, not their own, Interest.

6. Great joy of hope, (with freedom from anxious fear) for all good things to
come. [ Joy of Hope: which uses to be in all worldly felicities a far greater
joy, than that of possession] which makes holy men have mortem in desiderio,
which others so fear; vitam in patientia, which others so value.

7. Consider all the temporal blessings of holy and orderly living: more health
of body; longer life; serenity of mind; a pleasure sedate, pure, and constant;
but at no time violent, itching, or discomposing the subject of it, and
rendering mirth incapable of continuance, or also declining suddenly into pain,
or anguish. A joy not dwelling in the sense and lower felicities of beasts; in
eating, and drinking, and marriage; these when it uses, and rejoices in, it
is as though it used, and rejoiced, not: but in more Angelick, and Spiritual
complacencies; not consisting in having its carnal desires satiated; but
rather, in not having, and being freed from, such desires; (which is a content
equal to the enjoyment of them; Cui Deus haec fecit Supervacua, dedit.) A
pleasure (more retired and internal) of the mind and spirit; arising out of
several noble considerations of the Soul; which have no intercourse with, or
help from, Sense. A joy well consisting with, and many times very great, when
the sense is in pain, and of sense little or nothing perceived. Nay, A joying
in grief, and pains Romans 5.31. and proportioned to them; more joy (to
counterpoise them) as the pains are more; And Gaudet minus, si minus dolet,
because the Soul cannot have those special considerations, and passions, which
give it such a goust, and delight, but from such sufferings. So St. Paul's joys
still flowed the higher, the greater his tribulations were. And see a
resemblance (tho a very faint one) of it in Seneca's Philosophy, Ep. 18. Summa
voluptas (says he) in victa tenui. Voluptaes autem non illa levis, and fugax,
and subinde reficienda; sed stabilis, and certa. Non enim jucunda res est,
aqua, and polenta, sed summa voluptas est, adidse reduxisse, ut etc. Quanta
enim animi magnitudo etc.

Digr. Of the great blessing of long life.

8. The blessings on their Posterity, Associates, etc. for their sakes, in all
the contraries to those Judgments mentioned before. 3. n. 11. etc. which are
brought upon others, for the sinners sake. God not going less in his mercies,
than in his judgments.

Digr. Of the great efficacy, and benefit, of the Communion of Saints.

9. From doing to others all good, and returning no evil, much peace, and a
good name, amongst the most, or the best, of men. 1, Pet. 3, 13. Matt. 5.5. And
again; when, from contrary manners to, and non-compaliance with, the world he
incurrs the hate, and ill report thereof, in lieu of the worldly, a spiritual,
peace, and divine consolations more abundant. So that a good man suffers some
trouble from humane and temporal solaces, and endeavors to avoid them: And
every one, as he grows perfecter, and deeplier wounded with the divine love,
and desire of conformity to his Good Lord, takes a far greater delight in their
contraries, in sufferings, persecutions, injuries, retiredness, long devotions
and hard mortification; as being then most replenished with spiritual
Consolations; after the tasting of which, already all the world's delights are
become bitter, and sour. These therefore he chooses, armeth for, impatiently
expects; arrived to, glories in; wondering they are no greater which are to save
such a sinner, so well meriting damnation, from such infinite torments to come;
and which are to gain, to so vile a person, such infinite joys, and honor to
come.

. 9.
2 The great reward of it for the future.

1. The happiness of the Souls of Saints immediately after Death. Exemplified,
in the Soul of the H. Thief, accompanying the Soul of our Lord in Paradise the
same day he suffered: In that of the H. Beggar, Lazarus, receiving in Abraham's
bosom Consolations, for his former sufferings, in the lifetime of Dives his
Brethren, as the Parable represents it; wherein we may presume our Lord would
hint to the people no mistaken Notions of the future life. Who also elsewhere,
opposing the Sadduces that denied Spirits, argues Abraham to live still at this
present, because God after his death styled himself his God. Again, Exemplified
in the Souls of the Martyrs; who Rev. 6.9, 10, 11. -- 7.9.15. are clothed in
white Robes and attending on the Lamb, till, the residue of the Saints their
like sufferings for Christ being fulfilled, they should all at once resume,
from present corruption, their bodies glorified. The same happiness of
separated Souls instanced-in by St. Paul Heb. 12.23. where he numbers, standing
in the Divine presence, amongst Angels the Souls also of just men consummate.
Therefore our Lord, commends his spirit into the hands of his Father: and, St.
Stephen again, dying, recommends his into the hands of Jesus. And St. Peter 1.
Ep. 3, 4. chap. constitutes the hidden man of the heart, or the righteousness
of the Soul, in that which is not corruptible. Lastly; this future happy State
frequently represented in the joys, which holy Souls sometimes receive in this
life, in the loss of the senses, and cessation of the animal-functions; and,
particularly showed, in that rapt of St. Paul into the third Heaven, and
Paradise; and there receiving those unutterable Caresses: from whose doubting
language [whether in, or out of the Body, I know not,] may be gathered, that if
his Soul did not, yet it might have visited those places, when it was separate
from the Body. Which Apostle after this short experiment of those other
blisses, pronounces it much better to have this earthly tabernacle dissolved,
so to put on another celestial, an house not made with hands, a building of
God, eternal in the Heavens: and much better to be absent from the Body, so to
be present with Christ. And St. Peter, using much what the same language,
speaks of deposing his present tabernacle, or changing his habitation at his
death. 2. Ep. 1.14. As also he makes mention of Souls in Prison, who were
preached-to in the days of Noah. 1. Pet. 3.19.

2. The happiness of Soul and Body after the day of Judgment; where you may
entertain your thoughts on such contemplations as these, promised in his word,
who is faithful and true. The then renewed youth, vigor, beauty and agility of
the Body: The purity of the Soul from all Sin: Our glorious Habitation
Celestial: The most amiable Society of the Saints: Our vision and familiar
acquaintance, and conversation, with Angels; and Spirits: One Holy Spirit, and
an ardent, and mutual, love flaming in all: Christ our Spouse: God our Father:
All, Temples of the Holy Ghost, Members of Christ, Sons of God: The heavenly
City and Temple: Kings, and Priests: White Robes, Crowns, and Palms: Harps,
Songs, and Festivals; Life, Rest, and Peace for ever and ever: Heu mihi, quia
incolatus meus prolongatus est. Non sunt condignae passiones hujus Saeculi etc.
Momentaneum hoc and leve Tribulationis, quod in praesenti est, operatur
immensum supra modum gloriae pondus in sublimitate.

3. The several Degrees, of Glory, and also of our Graces, and services, [ i.
e. our satisfaction, love, our praising, and glorifiing, God] nobler there,
according to the several Degrees of our Service here.

4. Contemplation of the Reward, a great encouragement to the work.

5. Contemplation of the many various Degrees, and heights thereof proportioned
to our obedience, a great encouragement of an holy zeal to attain perfection in
our Works.

. 10
VII. Concerning the Faisibility, Easiness, Excellencies, of It.
VII. Next; Concerning the Faisibility and Easiness of this Service.

Consider,

1. The great light, we have, of Natural knowledge.

2. The natural Inclination we have to many good Duties, (as to Sobriety, etc.)
only alterable by custom, and ill example; and our Passions very serviceable
to the exercise of Virtues.

Digr, Of the Art of well using, and heightning, the Passion toward things of
Piety.

3. The Easiness of Christ's Yoke ( Matt. 11.30.) after a while, upon contrary
custom, and the removal of temptations; (as may be gathered by the
perseverance of Saints bearing this Yoke still with more, and more zeal,
whereas no forced actions are permanent): It being in many things heavy at
first, not so much from its opposition to natural Inclinations; as to vicious
habits, and ill education, and inadvertency of admitting alluring Objects etc,
His Commandments are not grievous. 1. Jo. 5.3.

4. The many Benefits of our Savior to mankind (which see displayed more
largely below Medit. 5.); and the advantageous repairs of our losses by the
first, in him, the second, Adam; and ours far happier times, since the Gospel.

5. The near Relations the Son of God, out of infinite love, has contracted to
us by his Incarnation; He our Father, we his Children; He our Husband, we his
Spouse; He our Head, we his Members; He our Root, we his Branches; He the
Foundation, we his Building; He the Son of God, we his Brethren; we his People,
and He our High Priest, who after he had here offered himself a Sacrifice for
us now, with his Blood, in the Heavenly Sanctuary makes perpetual Intercession
for us.

6. Baptism, in our Infancy, or at what time soever worthily received,
rescuing us from the Curse of Adam and his Posterity; and totally cancelling
all former hereditary, or personal, Guilt gratis; and restoring to us
supernatural Grace, lost by our first Parents, and God's friendship, and
favor: only carnal Concupiscence not quite eradicated, to make the acts of
Virtue more valuable, and the victories of Grace more excellent.

7. The sufficient ability all the baptized have, by this Grace procured by the
death of Jesus, and applied in Baptism, to perform the Covenant of the Gospel,
and all the obedience that is required under pain of Damnation; and to live
free, from the habit of any small sin, from the single Acts of any great one.

8. The great disparity of the malignity and guilt that is in Sins; of which
whilst we daily fall into some of the less, yet we may, and good Christians do
totally avoid the greater; in which respect they are called Saints, Holy,
Righteous, dead to, and no more committers of, Sin etc.

Digr. Of the narrow extent of Sins of excusing ( i. e. of natural) Infirmity;
which Infirmity is either in avoidable ignorance, when the understanding is
cozened; or inadvertency or want of observation, when the choice is surprised.
Hence great sins cannot be such; since we are neither in general ignorant of
them; nor, in particular Acts unobservant of them: nor yet small sins be such
if multiplied; since they also when frequent, must needs be pre-observed.

Of the danger of that Tenent [that God's Commandments cannot be kept, or
fulfilled] in that sense, as it is vulgarly misunderstood: (1.) That we cannot
live free from all greater sins (See Matt. 19.17. -- 5.17, 18. com. 19, 20. --
Romans 8.4.) as, from all Uncleanness, and Fornication, Avarice, Detraction etc;
all greater degrees of Intemperance, of Anger, Impatience, etc.

9. Many omissions of doing some good, and deficiencies in doing good, not
formal fins, though all are imperfections.

10. The many Benefits of the Holy Ghost (which see collected more fully below
in Medit. 6.) This the Promise of our Lord as he before was of the Father; and
this after his Ascension sent by him to abide with his here on earth, in his
necessary absence, until his second coming; and that, not to be a cohabitant
with us, as he; but an inhabitant within us, now made his Temples; the Seed of
God giving us a second Nativity, and making us new Creatures born of God,
conveying into our Souls Holiness, and into our Bodies immortality and life; as
our former Nativity did Sin and Death; inwardly illuminating our understandings
in the highest Mysteries of our Salvation, and confirming to the Soul all that
truth, which our Lord taught to the Ear; and communicating to the more perfect
extraordinary Revelations, and secrets of God: from time to time, inspiring the
will with new, and divine affections, and inflaming those more perfect with a
more impetuous and impatient love of God; some elevated to Rapt, and Ecstasy,
and to so perfect a Contemplation of, and Union with, the divine Majesty, as
this life is capable of; and whilst it acting thus in us, a Paraclet also
interceding for us, with groans unexpressible, asking all things for us; and
predirecting us in our affairs (many times contrary to humane reason) according
to the Will of God: which Will as to the present, and future this Spirit also
knows; and crying in our hearts Abba Pater: superabundantly comforting us in
all secular Distresses; and animating, and sealing us to future everlasting
Glories. O the high Nobility of a person once Regenerate! What Holiness may not
a man confidently aspire-to, that is thus inhabited by God!

11. The powerful, and diligent, assistances of the good Angels; who, as being
Fellow-Citizens, and Members under the same Prince, and Head Heb. 12.22. --
Ephesians. 1.10. -- Col. 1.20. full of Charity attend especially on the necessities
of the Saints: Daily carrying our Prayers, and joyfully presenting our good
Endeavors, to the heavenly Majesty; and procuring, and ministering his Blessings
to us, and rejoicing over one Sinner that repents; waging a continual war
against Satan and his Angels in our defense; suggesting, we may presume, as
assiduously good things to our mind, as Satan does evil; and, since their
Charity is no less than his Malice, as diligent to preserve, as he to destroy,
us; and to entice to good, as he to tempt to evil. Lastly, their number in the
spacious higher world infinitely great without expression (See Heb. 12.22.
Matt. 26.53. Dan. 7.10. Rev. 12.4.) And all the several Titles of their diverse
Orders; as Thrones, Dominations, Virtues, Principalities, Powers, Archangels,
Angels, (excepting the Cherubin, and Seraphin, the nearest Attendants upon the
heavenly Majesty. Esaias. 6.2. Rev. 4.6. comp. Ezech. 1.5, 26.) implying
Government, or Service, (See Dan. 10, 13.20, 21. Ephesians. 1.21. -- 3.10. -- 6.12.
Col. 1.16. -- 2.10.15. Rev. 15.7. Matt. 18.10. -- 24.31. Luke 16.22.) they
always giving a relation, or account, of their Embassies, and Employments, to
their Superior Potestates, or to God: who, tho in himself Omnipotent yet is
thus pleased, by many Subordinations of Agents, to govern the Universe, but
especially to provide all manner of Protection for his Servants in it. And, if
for nothing else, yet what a sad thing were it to be wicked, for this, that we
should thus contristate so many near, tho not seen Friends, and Patrons,
laboring our Salvation in vain. For these see Ezech. 10, 11, 12. -- 6.50. 2.
Pet. 2.11. comp. 10. Job. 1.6. Dan. 4.13.17. Rev. 8.3. -- 4, 5. -- 5, 6. Zech.
4.10. Luke 1.19. Tobit 12.15. 1. Kin. 22.19. Psalm. 84.7.

12. The Prayers, and Intercessions of the beatified Saints in Heaven for us
here on Earth, secure of their own Salvation, still solicitous for ours; and
the many Benefits that are received thereby.

13. The Good growing better by perseverance in welldoing from custom, and a
former habit; as the wicked, by continuing in sin, grow daily worse.

Digr. Of the great Power of Custom.

14. That, as it is a very dangerous condition, if any, (after having begun in
a more special manner to serve God, and after much well-doing) shall fall away,
and abandon themselves to sin; so it is no easy matter for, nor often happens
to, those, who are once truly converted to God, after they have found such a
difference in their Satisfaction, and comfort in serving God, from what they
had in serving the World; and after their taste of earthly pleasures is so much
altered ( Romans 6.21.) so to fall-away; but that falling they easily and quickly
rise again; and are very unquiet, and discontented, whilst they live in their
sin.

Digr. Of the great folly of not undertaking a strict, and holy life, out of
fear of inability to persevere.

15. The great retardements he receives, who has made some Progress in
Holiness, and Mortification, for the committing any single act of any greater
sin, from the fears he has 1 Of loosing all his former pains, and holy
endeavors of the Reformation of himself [ Ne perdat quod operatus est 2. Jo. 8.
I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them? Cant. 5.3.] 2 Of the after-long
griefs, and self-afflictions he knows he shall suffer for such an act. 3 Of his
being, though pardoned, yet set so much backward in his love to God, and the
love of God to him. 4 And of his being denied those great visitations, and
consolations of the Holy Spirit.

16. The certain addition of new and greater Graces upon former well managed.
Habenti dabitur Matt. 11, 12.

17. The chiefest Graces of God's Spirit ordinarily not merely gratuital, but
rewards of former service; and nothing given that is not first labored for,
except the ability to labor for them. The Grace little [in comparison] which
is bestowed at the first; And this little again, from the unprofiting,
withdrawn; Non habenti auferetur, quod habet. Regnum coelorum patitur vim, and
violenti rapiunt.

18. Our Preparations necessary for attaining Grace; and that it ordinarily
works in us according to each man's capacity, and his former natural, and
acquired, parts; neither, usually, changes it in us all natural imperfections.

19. The accesses, and recesses, and the vicissitudes of the Influences, and
Actings of the Holy Spirit in us, according to the more, or less, exercise of
our Devotions; the several preparations, and elevations, of the heart toward
God, and Divine things; and also according to the present needs of our
employments, sufferings, etc; and that it is excited, and improved by our
fervency, and care; and cooled by our neglect; grieved, affronted, quenched, by
our resistance. (See 1. Cor. 12.31. -- 2. Tim. 1.16. 1. Tim. 4.12, 13, 14, 15.
-- 2. Tim. 2.1. Apocal. 3.19. Romans 12.11. -- 2. Cor. 6.1, 2. -- 8.7. Gal. 5.25.
Ephesians. 5.17, 18. Col. 3.14, 15, 16. Col. 4, 5, 6. Heb. 12.28. Ephesians. 4.30. Matt.
25.8. 1. These. 5.19. Heb. 10.29. 1. Cor. 3.17. Most of which Texts are
Exhortations concerning husbanding, and improving the Graces received of God,
and not resisting the Spirit. Therefore (not to incur such hazard) the internal
motions of this Spirit whether operating in the Understanding, or the Will, are
to be very diligently attended-on, expected, hearkened to, especially in time of
Prayer: with much silencing of our own reason, and passions; and, among other
things, its unity carefully to be preserved in a bond of Peace with all our
Fellow Members. Ephesians. 4.3, 25. Col. 3.14, 15. Phil. 1.27.

20. God's Spirit working (less, or more) in all the Regenerate ( Gal. 5.17.):
and all those Acts, mentioned Gal. 5: 22, 23, its Fruits; And, therefore, we
obliged to a reverent entertaining, and prosecuting, of all those
illuminations, and motions that arise in us, which we think tend to any good;
(though many times the Spirit, to advance our cooperation, and reward in doing
well upon less assurance, gives no evident testimony to its self;) this pious
resentment of the Celestial Influence that we daily receive, much encouraging
us to go forward in Piety, and to return our thanks.

Digr. Of the well keeping, and preserving, Graces given.

21. Internal Consolations much more abounding, by external, and secular,
avoided.

22. By more holiness a ready assent to more illuminations (qui sequitur me,
non ambulat in tenebris): and Christianity not so much a Science, but
Experience (sentitur, antequam discitur); nor do they (though much learned,)
who serve not, truly know God, (i. e.) in his chiefest Excellencies, (He being
so intelligible only by this Experience): but they do remain still in darkness,
and Wisdom is justified only of her children.

23. By practicing and exercising of things better, the speedy attainment to a
perfect dis-affection, and contempt, of things worse and nothing worth. So, by
purging our selves from those works which are opposite to the doctrine of true
Faith, we procure a true Faith (see Jo. 3.19, 20. -- Jo. 5.44.) Quod nolumus,
difficile credimus: from working, believing; and from working, loving.

24. The great virtue and efficacy of the most excellent Grace of Charity, or
Love; which, once possessed, does the work and effect of all other Graces, by
its own power; and cures all Sins better than their proper remedies; whilst it
seeks in all things punctually to observe, and conform-to, the Will of him, and
in no small thing to displease him, with whom this ravished Soul is sick of
Love. Whilst she cares only for the things of the Lord, how she may please the
Lord 1 Cor. 7.23. and languishing with a perpetual desire of two things; 1.
Prayer. 2. Mortifications, and Sufferings; the last, the more to show her love
to God; the other, always in some manner to enjoy it. And this love of God also
infers that of our Neighbor, in respect of the many near relations he has to
God, and besides the Precept of it. And this love of our Neighbor again, in
its doing them no manner of ill, compendiously fulfills all the other laws of
our Duty toward them; as is observed by the Apostle, Romans 13.9, 10. -- 1. Cor.
13.4.

25. The excellent degrees of Perfection, that may be attained in this life;
And that our future glorification chiefly consists in a higher degree of
Sanctification, and Union with God, and with Christ; And this also, then to be
enjoyed in a higher degree by those who have acquired it here in a higher
measure. Hic esse incipimus, quod futuri sumus.

26. The holy Pattern of our Lord, and of the Saints, that have gone before us,
showing the Evangelical Precepts, practicable; and inviting, and encouraging,
our imitation. Ecce Ecclesia plena gregibus etc. St. Aust. Confess. 8. l. 11.
c. Behold the Church full of Societies of good Examples. There are embraced
within her arms so many children, Boys, and Girls, so much flourishing Youth,
and all other Ages etc. Tu non poteris, quod isti and istae? Art not thou able
to do what those Youths and Maidens are?

27. The high estimation and value the good works of his Saints have with God.
As being the acts, of his adopted Children; of his Son, whose Members they are;
and, he in them, and they in him: Of his Holy Spirit, always to be acknowledged
the principal Author of all these in them.

28. The Progress of Piety, to consist in an holy emulation and coveting, and
pursuing, still higher spiritual Gifts (1. Cor. 12.31. -- 14.1.); in inventing,
and beginning every day some new resolutions of holiness; thinking no Sanctity,
already acquired, worthy to gain eternal life ( Not as though I had attained,
or were already perfect, but I pursue etc. said the great Apostle Phil 3.12,
13, 14. Matt. 11, 12.): And, that it is not want of Grace, but of our
endeavor, and using at first some force upon our selves (according to which
the Spirit is increased) that hinders us from being Saints, (the violent take
heaven by force.) Et il Paradiso non e fatto Per i Poltroni.

29. The chief advance of our spiritual Estate, to be assiduity of Prayer; with
the neglect of which, those, who attempt Holiness, seem only to endeavor to
serve God with more pains, and trouble; and to deprive themselves in their work
of all content and solace; and besides, of those strong inclinations to the
attempting still something more excellent, which the very exercise of Prayer is
not only a Means to procure, but (by exciting in us the love of God) an
Instrument to effect.

30. The just aggravations of our continuance in Sin, when we are by the former
considerations left without any Plea of inability to Virtue, and Piety.

Digr. 1. Of the hainousness, and danger of returning to Sin, or looking back
toward forsaken pleasures, after having escaped their former pollutions (2.
Pet. 2.21.) and tasted the heavenly Gift ( Heb. 6.4.)

Digr. 2. Of the great Peril, and also Ingratitude, of neglecting or resisting
the Motions of the Holy Spirit in us, or incurring those Sins, whereby it is
offended, and grieved; and, of the desolate condition of such, as are once thus
forsaken.

PART II. COUNSELS.
. 11.
COncerning these Counsels, by way of Introduction Consider; That you are
obliged to the observance of all God's Precepts, and Commands; and that, as the
Reward is very high, eternal life; so these Precepts are very pure, and
contrary to carnal, and secular, Lusts. Now, many Counsels there are, delivered
by our Lord, by his Apostles, by the Saints of following times, in the
observance of which Counsels (though recommended only, not enjoined to any) the
Precepts are much more easily kept, because such Counsels, practiced, put us
out of the occasions, and temptations, of sinning; but without these Counsels
much more difficultly the Precepts observed. Because such persons, retaining
still the temptations, engage themselves as it were upon a perpetual Fight,
that they may not fall into the Sin; in which as the Victory is very honorable,
so the Battle is very hazardous (for their Enemies, being thus allowed all the
advantages, and preparations, they can make against them, without receiving any
disturbance therein, are hereby very much strengthened): and Experience shows,
that the most of such Combatants lose the day; and little Apology they can make
for themselves, since they choose to work out their Salvation rather with such
pain, and uncertainty, when they are showed a way to do it with much ease, and
security. A difficulty indeed there is also in the Counsel, but it is only at
the first, namely resolutely to accept, and embrace it; the practice of which
Custom afterward renders most easy: but the difficulty of avoiding Sin, where
the Counsels are neglected, and all temptations, and occasions indulged, is
perpetual, and never at an end.

. 12
Again; there being a certain Latitude in all Christian Virtues, and Duties,
(amongst which also I number our repentance, and humiliations for Sin), in
which you may go so high, as that the degree, wherein you perform it, as to the
quantity, frequency, etc. is indeed, for encouraging our best endeavors, by the
Divine wisdom allowed, commended, or (if you will) required upon the title of
perfection, and lastly highly rewarded; but, out of his mercy to our weakness,
is not strictly commanded upon the forfeiture of our being any longer good, or
virtuous; nor the omission of them punished. So, on the other side, you may go
so low, as that the degree, wherein you perform it, as to the quantity,
frequency, etc. is the most inferior, that the Virtue, to exist at all, can
admit; and further than which if you descend you fall short of it, and break
the Precept concerning it, and commit a Sin. Again; The bounds of this lowest
degree, less than which transgresses the Precept, being also very uncertain,
so that it is hard to say thus much done, if no more, is sufficient, as it may
be certainly concluded of the higher degrees, that the more the better; I say
from these Considerations, a wise man would rather have something over, than
something wanting; something of what is in Consilio only, than fall short of
what is in Praecepto; and not to divide a hair in his obedience, and choose to
walk still upon the brink of Sining. And this especially; When as the most of
men, upon what confidence I know not, but de facto so it is, fall short of
Salvation; See before. 5. n. 3. And again; Whenas we shall not lose a mite of
the over-measure we make for attaining heaven, which shall not have its
peculiar reward ( Eccl. 11.23. Say not, what profit is there of my service, and
what good thing shall I have hereafter): When as all the Contest is, whether we
should love God so much more, who so without all measure loves us; or how far,
sinless, we may love the world, [i. e. God's Enemy]. When, at least as to one
main matter, Repentance, and Humiliations for Sin, perhaps our past offenses
have been so high, as they also require an excessive proportion of Penitences,
and self-revenges: Lastly; When as the Saints, that have gone before us, have
walked in all these Counsels, and thought this perhaps little enough to
preserve Innocence, and gain Heaven: Nay, When as our Lord took this way,
without any need, on purpose to recommend to us his own Example. Go on then; If
you keep the Precept and stand firm, all is well; but if you fall and miscarry,
know that, because you have despised her Counsels, Wisdom will laugh at your
Calamity; And, That, if you stand and all be well to you, keeping the Precept,
yet to those, who keep the Counsel too, all shall be better. For the higher
degrees of the Precepts, or of those virtues that are in Precepto (as for
Example, the higher degrees of temperance) are Counsels: which, though, not
observed they bring no guilt; yet, practiced, they are highlier rewarded. And,
besides this, the observance of the Counsels in one virtue very much conduces
to the performance of the necessary Precept in another (as the higher degrees
of temperance, to the observance of necessary Chastity:) And hence, upon a
double account, are Counsels recommended to your Christian Practice; both, as
disposing you more easily to keep the Precepts, and as in themselves rewardable
beyond them; and, as to both these, may advance your Perfection.

. 13
The Practice of a holy, and spiritual Life chiefly consists in these four.

1. Humbling, and judging, and taking revenge on, our selves for our sins past.
2. Using all means for subduing and preventing sins for the future. 3.
Diligently practicing all Christian Duties; or doing good. 4. Willingly
undergoing all afflictions for Christ's, and our Duty's sake; or Suffering
evil.
Counsels, Counsels.
for the more facilitating, and advancing, the performance, of these Duties;
and especially, of the two first.

. 14
1. In forbearing many things not probibited.
1. Forbearing the practice or use of many things permitted and lawful, and the
doing or using of which is no sin: because, (considering humane nature corrupt)
they are very frequent temptations to sin; and, though lawful, seldom lawfully
used; where know, that forbearance, and abstinence, from them is far more easy
t than moderation in them; and constant forbearance, than that which is
sometimes intermitted. Estava to do el danno en no quictar de raiz laes
occasiones. S. Teresa's life 6. chap.

2. And practicing many things not commanded.
2. Practicing many things not commanded ( i. e. under guilt of sin): because
they are very expedient helps for the prevention of sin; Or also, advantages
for the better exercise of Christian virtues, and the more patient endurance of
usual afflictions.

3. Being always of the two more careful to avoid the temptations to evil, than
(in a hazardous passage through them) zealous perchance to do some good;
because innocence is far more acceptable than a good work without it: Neither
may we venture someway to offend God, that we may (some otherways) please him.

These Counsels recommended to Practice, especially, in these Particulars
following. 1. In the matter of Riches and Wealth.

. 15.
In the Particulars.
1. Of Riches and Wealth.
1. Not seeking after, or also freely parting with, wealth and riches; [by
riches I mean whatever exceeds St. Paul's sufficiency or competency, or enough
to satisfy just necessities 1. Tim. 6.6, 8.]; Well weighing, and often
meditating on these, and such like Texts. 1. Tim. 6.9, 10. Matt. 19.23, 24. --
13.22. Luke 12.20. Prove. 1.32. Again these: Luke 6.24, 25. -- 16.25. Rev. 18.7.
Psalm. 17.14. Again these: Matt. 19.21. Luke 12.33. Act. 2.44, 45. Luke 19.8.
19. Luke 16.9. 1. Tim. 6.19. Which Texts after you have well considered, I
suppose you will not so much wonder at this Advice, as at the Christian's
common contrary Practice. I said; parting with them; which at once cures, all
Trust in, Cares for, (Quae possident homines, student augere,) Temptations of,
them; and removes by reason of these all those difficulties, and only to God
possibilities, of a rich man's being saved (mentioned by Christ, Matt. 19.23,
24.) Especially, if you suspect your self inclined to Avarice, giving
plentifully, and often; for, as some Vices are best overcome by flying (as
Carnal lusts); so others, by resisting and fighting them (amongst which is
Covetousness).

2. Practicing, at least sometimes, the inconveniences, and sufferings of
Poverty; to try by the tolerableness of these the unnecessariness of Wealth;
The Philosopher's Advice. Seneca Epist. 18.20.

3. Putting some bounds to unsatiable desires, (due respect being had to a
competency,) by making a firm resolution, after you have attained such a
moderate proportion of Wealth for your self, or for the Portions of your
Children, or other Relations, for whom you are obliged to provide, (unless you
may judge your present Estate sufficient) to dedicate all future gain, or
increase, to pious and charitable Uses. Or, alotting to God and his Poor
constantly such a set Portion, a fifth, or tenth, or some other part out of
your Revenue and Gains to be unviolably observed, and laid by for their service.

Recommendation of Poverty, or a Competency only.
4. Choosing, or, it already possessed, continuing, as the most happy, the State
of Poverty, or competency and having only what is necessary; which voids all
the temptations, and dangers of Wealth, and is the most proper Nurse, and
Guardian, of many excellent Virtues, and Graces of the Holy Spirit: [ Parens
quaedam Generatioque vertutum (says St. Ambrose) and therefore put the first
amongst the Beatitudes]. Parent of humility (the poor in fortunes being more
commonly poor in Spirits.) Of Evangelical obedience, and devotion, dependence
on God, and consequently Prayer; Of tranquillity, and contentedness, cares
always accompanying the possession of that which every one strives for ( si vis
vacare animo, aut pauper sis oportet, aut pauperi similis, Seneca): Of
Sobriety, as it were necessitated, in all the several kinds of it; and
consequently of better health, and temper of Body, and moderation of passions:
Of diligence in some employment, meekness, gentleness, patience, the putting
up, and not revenging injuries, and not gainsaying, qualities more suitable to
inferiors; which State is always the most fitly prepared for divine favors,
both by the virtuous endowments of the Soul, and also meaness of our condition:
God most magnifying himself in the lowest; both, least flesh should glory
before him; and, that his power may be the more seen in our weakness. [For
which see and meditate on these Texts; 1. Cor. 1.26, 27, 28. 2. Cor. 12.9, 10.
Jam. 4.6. Matt. 11.5. Luke 14.21. comp. 18, 19. Jam. 2.5. Luke 6.20, 21, 22. --
16.25.] But above all, this condition is the more amiable, as being the chosen
secular condition of our Lord Christ, and of his holy Apostles. See Matt. 8.20.
Zech. 9.9. Matt. 10 9. 1. Cor. 4.9. etc. 2. Corin. 6.4. etc. -- 12.10. etc.

2. Of Honor, Preferment.
1. Not seeking Honor, Preferments, or public Offices, (you having a
competency, and a present lawful employment; things of which few are
destitute:) whether this proceeds from other Ambitions, or, as you think, from
that of doing more good thereby. Not seeking them; Because of a greater charge,
and duty, always accompanying them, for which you must be accountable; Because
of the multiplied cares thereof, leaving you less vacancy for attendance on
Prayer, and Celestial things; which vacancy you ought, by all means you can, to
preserve for the doing your chiefest business, that of the next World: for, it
may well be applied to this secular engagement, what the Apostle advises
concerning another, 1. Cor. 7.33. Qui sine uxore est [read it, sine officio]
solicitus est quae Domini sunt, quomodo placeat Deo: qui autem cum uxore,
solicitus est quae sunt mundi, quomodo placeat uxori; and divisus est. And ver.
35. Hoc ad utilitatem vestram dico, quod facultatem praebeat sine impedimento
Dominum obsecrandi. (The Apostles frequently advising us to whatever may
further, dissuading from whatever may hinder, Prayer, the chief business in
this life: See this chapter v. 5. -- 1. Pet. 3.7. Matt. 5.23, 24. -- 1. Tim. 2.8.
Jam. 1.6.) And ver. 32. Volo autem vos sine solicitudine esse. Again; Because
of the many Temptations, and great Sins, to which secular Greatness and State,
joined with Wealth, and Applause (its two ordinary Handmaids) exposes you.
Concerning which Temptations, and Sins, the former Counsels and Texts, being as
applicable to an honorable, and a low condition, as before, to a rich, and a
poor, need not here be repeated. Lastly, Because of the many changes, to which
secular Greatness is liable; and from which though no condition whatever in
this world is freed, yet, much the more steadfast, and fixed, and always equal,
are the lowest. As for the invitement to all these hazards, the doing more
good, consider; that it is also most what a temptation, proceeding from too
much self-love, and self-esteem; that, if indeed you be not so worthy, and fit
for the right discharge of such Office, as some others, your procuring it does,
for so much, hinder, and diminish the public Good. Again, being exposed to so
many more Temptations by it, your Humility ought to fear, that the Sins you
shall commit are likely to over count the Good you may perform; and that, in
this case, you ought to prefer your own Innocence before your neighbor's
Benefit; and the not offending God by Sin, before your pleasing him with some
good Work; he requiring Purity before Charity, and Obedience before Sacrifice.

2. Refusing also such Honors, and Preferments, when offered (preserving due
obedience to those who may command you;) because there are persons enough, fitter
than your self (as you ought to think) to possess them.

3. Prescinding at once all ambitious desires, and designs, and the many vices
that attend them, (after a due respect had to the sufficiency of your present
condition) by passing a firm Resolution never to solicit for, or accept, when
freely offered (unless constrained to it by authority, not to be opposed) any
higher place, or preferment, in this world; men much more freely, and devoutly
attending to their spiritual Progress, when they have concluded their secular.

Recommendation of Humiliations and of a low Condition.
4. Diligently practicing frequent Humiliations of your self to mean persons,
and services, below your condition (See Romans 12.10, 16. Jam. 1.10.) considering
the many Virtues, and Graces in us that receive great growth thereby, and rise
still higher, as our Humility can descend still lower; and this is the proper
effect of such Humiliations: considering also the Tranquillity, and Peace
enjoyed by it, whilst we seek that, wherein we have no Competitor; but wherein
all are ready rather to further our design. But especially imitating the
Pattern of our great Lord in this Practice Matt. 20.28. And Jo. 13.4. etc.
where he professes he did it for a Pattern ver. 14, 15. And obeying his
Lessons Luke 14.10. -- 9.46. Matt. 18.2. -- 23.12. Mar. 9.35, 36. where he
directs the Guest to take the lowest place, that so he might be called higher;
and by an humble Child brought in amongst them, teaches his ambitious
Disciples, that the true way to be greatest was to be least; and, first, was to
be last. Greatest: for the present; i. e. in Virtue, and, in the esteem of God,
and his good Angels, even whilst he is last in Place and men's esteem. But
greatest too, for the future; this being, in the rule of God's Economy, the
only posture for Preferment, he depressing the high, and exalting the low: and
so such a State, if it were only out of ambition, to be chosen, which God, and
Men love to advance.

. 16.
2. And Reputation.
1. And as for Honors, Preferments, and Offices; so, for Reputation, and a Name
(which we may seek also, even in the not-seeking the other): Keeping ever a
strict watch of not being tainted, at least, with this most subtle Evil; never
suffering the praise of men to be a motive to you of undertaking any Action.
The praise of men, a thing so little worth; which is but of a few of them only;
in some Corner only of this lower world: most of these too of little judgment;
and this perhaps misinformed, or partial (as is the praise of friends); or
dissembling, and praising only from the lips outward, when the heart despises
and very mutable, commending to Day, condemning to Morrow: (See how it went
with our Lord himself, Benedictus qui venit on Palm Sunday, and Crucifige,
Crucifige, within five days after;) the most being of a perverted judgment, and
commending things no way praiseworthy, and so this drawing aside the ambitious
thereof from doing what his conscience would tell him is most fit, to what is
most applauded; (the occasion of the Pharisees great miscarriage in their
actions. Jo. 12.43.5.44. And see Jo. 5.41.) Lastly, all in a short time swept
away from the earth, the praiser, and praised; and both forgotten, and unknown
to Posterity. This praise of men therefore always rejected, let your only
motive be the Praise you shall have with God (2. Cor. 10.18. Romans 2.29. -- 1.
Cor. 4.7.), and with his Holy Angels, infinitely more numerous; persons more
honorable; of a constant being; and, in the next world, our near Acquaintance,
and Associates never lost; but to whom, now also, we are a spectacle, as well
as to men (1. Cor. 4.9. -- 1. Tim. 5.21.): and our present Actions discoursed
of in the Court of heaven; and laid up in their Memories ( Job. 1.8. Zechar.
1.12, 13. -- 3.2.): Who see, and rejoice for any good done to us ( Luke 2.14.),
or done by us ( Luke 15.7.) and this our Reputation with them declared by our
Lord to be worth the valuing: See Luk: 12.8.9. Rev: 3.5. -- 14.10. Matt. 25.31.
Eccl. 6.5. 1. Tim. 3.16. Who considers much, and often, that all his Virtues
are seen, and registered in the Court of heaven, will little care to be
applauded, or known in the Village of this world: or rather in but one Cottage
of it. Mihi pro minimo est, ut judicer ab humana die. 1. Cor. 4.3. Nay, Si
hominibus [i. e. mundi] placeo, Christi servus non sum Gal. 1.10. This then,
often meditated on, will animate you to worthy performances with much secrecy
(knowing that God and his Angels see you); and thus, you shall seldom do
amiss; for, according to the praise we look after, God's, or Men's, either not
the same Actions will be done by us, or not after the same manner.

2. Upon some Good done by you, suddenly diverting any thought of receiving
praise from men for it; least such a thought, if long dwelt on, stain the
Purity of your good Deeds; and this Praise be your empty reward thereof; and
you lose your reward with God. (consider Matt. 6.2.5.16. Faciunt ut
honorificentur ab hominibus: Amen, dico vobis, receperunt mercedem suam ( Luke
14.12.) Hindering it also, as not indeed due to you, but to God; and only, by
their error it is, if by men given to you; and, if your good works are to be
seen of men ( Matt. 5.16.), yet it is, that they may glorify, not you on earth
but, your Father in Heaven. Again: what Praise is brought to you against your
Will, immediately transmitting it entire to God with a -- Non nobis Domine, sed
nomini tuo. For it is certain, what you do any way Good, all the good thereof
is not from You, but from God; and so the praise thereof to be transferred,
without your retaining it at all, to the right owner: the rest that is yours
are only the infirmities and defects joined with it; and for these you ought to
blush; and not desire praise, but pardon of God, the only Author of all Good,
and very free and communicative of it, yet, in return of Praise for it, stands
much upon his Right; and usually suffers his Rivals, that rob him of it,
afterward to fall shamefully. (See Act. 12.23.)

3. Silently suffering causeless Infamy; and meekly accepting, and offering it
to God, as a deserved punishment for other faults; especially practicing thus,
where Malice seems unsatisfiable; and more contention only likely to arise from
a defense; and where a just vindication bears show of too much self-esteem:
Considering, our Lord's behavior, to the admiration of the Judge, at his
Arraignment for Seditions, Treason, Blasphemy. Matt. 26.63. -- 27.12.14. Who
(says St. Peter, 1. Pet. 2.23.) when he was reviled, reviled not again; when
he suffered, threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges
righteously: And the Apostles (1. Cor. 4.12.) Being defamed we entreat; being
reviled we bless; being persecuted we suffer it; knowing, that God sooner
undertakes, for those, the Justification of their Innocence, who, for
Peace-sake, and out of much humility, leave it wholly to him; and in his good
time performs it much more convincingly than themselves could.

Recommendation of Self Contempt.
4. Cheerfully entertaining any Contempt: Which is a breeder of Humility, in the
same manner, as Honor is of Pride. And which contempt of secular Reputation,
and also of secular Contempt, out of an affection to things divine (that are
usually much disparaged by the world) keeps men steady in Goodness; and cutts
off most of the Sins of Discourse; (much of which Discourse is directed to vain
Glory, and Applause, (to be attained only in bad things, from corrupt
judgments); or, is spent in justifying our selves against Contradictors; all
which our love of Contempt avoids;) as also it cutts off all discord, hate, and
envy arising from emulation for Precedence and Honor; when, every one striving
to be uppermost, and quarrelling with those that obstruct it, he, that can be
content to be below, is always at rest, and enjoys himself. Joyfully also
entertaining the being evil-entreated, and evil-spoken of, so it be not for
evil; which, causlesly, and patiently received, with perseverance in that
goodness, for which you so suffer, has an exceeding reward hereafter, for a
small loss sustained here. In such a case happy are ye (says St. Peter, 1.
Pet. 4.13.): Count it all joy (says St. James) Jam. 1.2. Jubilate and
exultate. (says our Lord) Luke 6.23. Nor may any think themselves to stand
obliged from that Text, 1. These. 5.22. To avoid all appearance of evil, when to
any Person good things appear evil; Or obliged from that Text, Col. 4.8. To do
whatsoever things are of good report, when the report of good is not such as it
ought; nor things of good report such things, as are good. But we are to avoid
all appearance of evil; when the things appearing evil are such as we may
forbear; i.e. are among things indifferent: and we are to do all things of good
report; i.e. good report among the good.

3. Of lawful sensual Pleasures.
1. Forbearing sensual, though lawful Pleasures.

2. Avoiding at the first, as much as may be, any knowledge, and experience of,
or skill in, them; for, by this is cut off the longing after them.

Digr. How hardly such Pleasures can consist with Piety.

3. Especially, choosing rather, if you can live continently, a single life,
than Marriage. To which the more to excite and encourage you,

. 17. n. 2.
1. Consider: The greater dignity of this, than of a conjugal, life: For as
Uncleanness is more especially opposite to Holiness, than other vices (See Romans
6.19. These. 4.7. Ephesians. 5.3.) and has a natural shame and guilt upon it, which
makes it seek privacy beyond any other Sin whatever, (See the shame of our
first Parents upon the first appearance of Concupiscence Genesis 2.25. comp. Genesis
3.10.) And as there is a Purity and Holiness of the Body as well as of the Soul
(See 2. Cor. 7.1. -- 1. These. 4.4. Jud. 23. comp. 8. And 2. Pet. 2.10.14.)
opposite to this Fornication, and Uncleanness; and enjoined to be observed in
reference to Christ; he being now the Husband of the Body and it his Spouse
(See 1. Cor. 6.20. compared with 13.18. etc.) So there seems to be a greater
degree of this Purity of the Body, opposite to Matrimony: See 1. Cor. 7.34. and
Rev. 14.4. where defilement with women is opposed to Virginity, as another
defilement with Harlots is opposed to Matrimony Heb. 13.14. The marriage bed is
undefiled, that is, with Sin; (for this was appointed, as for a means of
propagation to Adam innocent, so for a remedy against Fornication 1. Cor. 7.2.
to man fallen, and troubled with Concupiscence): But the Virgins bed, it seems,
is more undefiled, more Angel-like, in respect of corporeal Purity: [undefiled]
being opposed to an imperfection of Chastity Virginal; as well as to the sin of
Lust; to the act of Concupiscence, as well as to prohibited Copulations; And
therefore (hereafter) not to marry, nor be given in marriage, but to be like
the Angels of God, is reckoned as a thing more honorable for the Body ( Luke
20.35.) And Concupiscence, one cause now of Marriage, and, which, could it be
remedied, the Apostle would not advise so many to Marriage, was not known by
Adam when perfect; and was a thing, when appearing upon his fall, which he was
ashamed of; and sought to hide, as his Posterity ever since do, those acts even
of the lawful bed. To a higher degree (then) of this primogeneal virginal
Purity of the Body I suppose that expression relates 1. Cor. 7.34. The Virgin
cares etc; that she may be holy both in Body, and in Spirit.

And for this reason it seems to be, that we find abstinence from the acts of
(if I may so call it) lawful Lust advised (for the better performance of holy
Duties, or, in times of Humiliation etc.) even to those, who are in the State
of Marriage; (as doubtless conjugal Chastity also has many degrees in it, and
in some men is far more pure than in others; and the permissions of Matrimonial
Privileges are very easily transgressed). See Exodus 19.15. before the descent
of the Lord upon Mount Sinai, the people commanded three days sanctification,
and not coming at their wives. 1. Sam. 21.4. Women kept from the young men for
about three days, and the vessels of the young men holy [ i.e. from their
wives]. See Zechar. 7.3. in times of more earnest Addresses to God, this
separation from Carnality continued. Neither is this only
Old-Testament-Ceremonial-Holiness: But see, 1. Cor. 7.5. a place parallel to
these: Defraud ye not one another except it be with consent for a time, that
you may give your selves to Fasting and Prayer; where it may be noted, that as
Fasting has no good correspondence with the acts of the conjugal bed ( sine
Cerere etc.); so these acts also are as prejudicial to Fasting, and its
Companions. And, suitable to these Scriptures were the Decrees of the ancient
Church: Diebus orationis, and jejuniorum, and preparationis ad Eucharistiam, a
conjuge abstinendum. And this, because carnal pleasures are some way or other
always enemies to Spiritual Exercises: either proceeding to excess, and so
rendering us faulty; or too much either heightning, or also debilitating our
temper, and so making us undisposed; or dividing and diverting some portion of
that love, and of those intentions, to things inferior, which are always all
incomparably best spent upon, and consecrated to, God, the supreme Good.

Again we find, that after one Marriage the abstaining from a second is both
commended (see Luke 2.36.) and to some persons, to wit, those entertained in
the pious, or holy services of God, or of the Church, enjoined. As appears in
the Widows of the Church (1. Tim. 5.9.) of whom it is there required; That such
Widow have been the wife of one man: Which words being capable of several
senses; either, that she have not had two husbands at once; or not two
successively: again, not two successively, either by a Divorce from the former;
or upon the Death of the former; Seeing that no Woman might have two Husbands
at one time, nor any Woman at all was allowed remarrying upon Divorce (See 1.
Cor. 7.11.) It follows, that the Apostles Widow must be understood to be such,
as had not had a second Husband after the first dead. For this Injunction seems
to have something singular in it, the same caution being given no where to any,
but only to Church Officers, and Servants. And the Apostle seems here rather to
require something of extraordinary example and goodness above others, in such
as were thus to be devoted to the Churches Service, and maintained by her
Charity, than only to caution that they should not be of the most wicked among
Christians. Which is further confirmed by St. Paul's displeasure against
against those Church Widows that re-married (ver. 11.) And if this
Interpretation be admitted for the Widows, so ought it to be, upon the like
expression [a Husband of one Wife] for the Bishops of the Church. 1. Tim. 3.2.
And, for the Deacons. 1. Tim. 3.12.

2. Consider the great advantages, spiritual and secular, of a single life, and
forbearance of Marriage to those who can live continently, for Prayer, and
Fasting, and all other service of God without distraction: and so, for gaining
the Kingdom of Heaven ( Matt. 19.12.) For works of Charity to our Neighbor;
For avoiding Covetousness, worldly Cares, and Impediments; and this in all, not
only in afflicted, times: For enjoying our Liberty (1. Cor. 7.4.) which when we
can have it, we are rather to use it, 1. Cor. 7.21. See for these 1. Cor. 7.
Ver. 5. That you may give your selves to Fasting and Prayer, verse. 28. Such
[the married] shall have trouble in the flesh: I spare you, verse. 35. I would
have you without carefulness. He, that is unmarried cares for the things of
the Lord how he may please the Lord: But he that is married cares for the
things of the World, how he may please his Wife [and is divided, as the Vulgar
has it]. The Virgin cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be Holy
both in Body and Spirit: but She that is married cares for the things of the
World, how she may please her Husband: Verse. 35. This I speak for your own
profit, That you may attend upon the Lord without distraction. Verse. 38. Who
gives her not in Marriage does better. See Matt. 19.12. There be, who have
made themselves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. He, who is able to
receive it, let him receive it. See Luke 14.20. -- 1. Tim. 5.4, 5, 6.11.12.

3. Consider its higher reward in the next life. For tho Celibacy, as it
occasions other fruits of Righteousness, has no preeminence before this in
Wedlock, if a married condition also produces the same; Yet, as in it self it
is a stronger resistance of the lustings of the Flesh, and a greater subduer of
that natural Concupiscence, which all have less or more; whose importunities it
heroically repelleth, whilst the married only lawfully satisfies them: thus it
seems worthy of, and so to have promised to it, an higher Reward, and Crown, in
the world to come, and is one of the most eminent of all the Virtues, as not
moderating, but subduing, the most violent of Passions. And those, who grant in
the Kingdom of Heaven several degrees of Glory, proportioned to those here of
Sanctity, must give the highest to Virgins; because, if supposed only equal
with the rest in all other Graces, they are granted in one to be Superior.

4. Consider (I say not the actual possession always, but) the attainableness
of this Grace of Continency by all using the means, i, e. much Prayer and
Meditation, Temperance, constant Business, remoteness from Temptations, etc. --
Proijce te in Illum, [Deum] non se subtrahet, ut cadas, said St. Aust. to
himself about leaving his Incontinency. Confess. 8. l. 11. c. Where by the Grace
of Continency, I mean not a power of being freed from all Concupiscence, and
from the first motions of Lust (for so none at all have this power); but for a
power to suppress these first motions, and quench these lesser sparks before
they break out into a flame; i. e. either into 1 Fornication: therefore, 1.
Cor. 7. ver. 2. Marriage is opposed to Fornication, as it is, Ver. 9. to
burning; or into 2 Uncleanness [which Uncleanness distinct from Fornication is
no small Guilt, but every where marches along with it as its fellow in the
Catalogue of those Sins that exclude us from Heaven (see Gal. 5.19. Ephesians. 5.3.
Col. 3.5. -- 2. Cor. 12.21. Some kinds of this Uncleanness being advanced above
any other Sin, except that in Spiritum Sanctum. See 2. Pet. 2.10. Romans 1.24.
Ephesians. 4.18, 19. Rev. 22.15.] Or thirdly into morose delectation somenting first,
and heating our selves by it, before we put it out (see 1. Cor. 7.9. ver.
expounded by the seeond): In respect of which Virginal Continency in several
persons is less or more pure. This Power, I say, seems attainable by all using
the means. From 1. Tim 5.11, 12: Where the Apostle could not justly have blamed
the Widows, when some of them young, for re-marrying, whose Marriage he says
was out of wantonness; and that they had damnation for having cast off their
first faith, and promise ( i. e. of living single, and attending wholly to
those charitable duties etc,) which they had made to Christ and the Church.
But, if God had not given them the power of observing their Vow, the Apostle
should have allowed their re-marrying, and blamed their vowing; who ordered
also for the future, that such young women should no more be admitted to such
Vows, or Duties for public service of the Church; not because they could not,
but ordinarily would not, abstain: From Matt. 19.12; where our Lord would not
have recommended the like resolution, and attempt in those, who, he says, made
themselves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven, if he would not also be
assistant to them with his Grace, as he approved their purpose and design; to
which also they were allured by his Encomiums of that happier condition: Nor
would he have, and that in general, commended those, who leave the Pleasures of
Marriage for the Kingdom of God's sake, that is, for the better serving God in
any way (See 1. Cor. 7.34, 35.) Or those, who have left their wives, ( i. e. by
mutual consent) 1. Cor. 7.4, 5. From 1. Cor. 7.37; where the Apostle places
the exercise of Continency in a steadfast purpose, and mastering so far their
own Will. Again, From the Churches perpetual practice of Vows in this matter of
Continency for either Sex, that undertakes a Monastic life; and from the
ancient Churches both Oriental and Occidental their prohibiting, tho not, that
no married Person might be admitted to Sacred Orders, or, that every one, upon
these received, must separate from his Wife; yet, that none, when single at his
entering into Holy Orders (I mean of Priesthood) might afterward marry. Which
shows the persuasion of Antiquity to be, either that Continency was denied to
none using the means etc; or else, that it being a special Gift only to some,
every one before his taking of Orders, or making a Vow, might certainly know
not only whether he had the Gift for the present; but, whether he might also
persevere therein to his Death (for as much as concerned the Grace of God, the
Doner thereof, its enabling him). But here it is unintelligible, how such
assurance can arise only to some particular persons: nor can any direct, how
such a special Gift, not only for the present, but the future also, may be
discerned.

Again: If we consider how many both before, in, and after Marriage are
obliged, without enjoying the relief of the conjugal bed, to live continently,
it must needs be granted, that this is a Gift, if not universally, yet very
commonly, attainable: and such, as for some time at least may be possessed by
every one. For this is certain that wherever Marriage or the Use of it is
unavoidably hindered, or by God himself also prohibited, there also is given by
Him the Power to contain. Now this happens in very many Instances Before, In,
and After, Marriage.

. 17. n. 3.
1. For, First, before Marriage (there being many Ceremonies to be observed in
it) many surprisals of Lust seize upon Youth, that are more liable to it, in an
unripe Age (of 12, 13, 14. years old perhaps) which for the present that way
cannot be remedied, who many times may not marry without the License of their
Superiors: as it happens, to Youth yet under the power of their Parents (to
whom the Apostle allows a power in disposing them. 1. Cor. 7.36. etc. And it is
there to be noted, that he considers much more the Fathers inclination toward
her single life or marriage than the Virgins): And to Servants, not yet made
free from their Masters. Besides that, many other causes of delaying Marriage
may intervene: As when it is not permitted to any at certain times of the year,
set aside for Humiliation. So, when external impediments occurr; as being in a
Journey, or Imprisoned, or upon the Sea, etc. and in many other cases; and these
happening mostwhat in the Age too wherein Concupiscence is in its greatest
strength. Here, if some have not the Power of Continency, nor yet of the remedy
Marriage, how will Incontinency become a Guilt?

2. Again: In the State of Marriage, there is a necessary power of Continency
always required in respect of Concupiscence toward any Person whatsoever
(notwithstanding the many Temptations the World presents) saving one, i. e. his
Wife; and toward all absolutely, when any sickness happens to that one Party to
which we are confined: or, when any casual debility, tho never recoverable. So
also, in all necessary absence about worldly Affairs, in Journies, in being
taken Captive by the Turks, or others, we must allow this Gift. Else, how can
Husbands, when busied abroad by Employments, Embassies, Warfare, etc, be secure
of the honesty of their Wives? Or, how can the State, which many times permits
not their Wives to follow them, lawfully make such a separation, by which they
shall necessitate them to Sin? So when the Woman is menstruous, or, after
Childbirth, before she is Churched, at least to those that were under Moses's
Law. See Lev. 18, 19. -- 20.18. Ezech. 18.6. Which abstinence, in the Birth of
a Maid-child, was enjoined for Eighty days, almost a quarter of the year. See
Lev. 12.5, etc.

3. And so after Marriage dissolved, we must allow this Gift to all that are
(justly or unjustly) divorced, who are prohibited under pain of Adultery a
second Contract, all or most of them. We must allow it also to the Bishops, and
to the Widows forenamed. Add to this: that, of those that marry, few (if we
examine things well) do it because they want the Power of Continency, but for
other reasons; as apears in many forbearing Marriage as long as their places,
or other secular respects consist not with it: and presently, when quit of
these, engaging in it. And in most persons wedding after the Heat and
Concupiscence of their Youth is already in the wane, and declination. And, when
we see so many without marrying at length reclaimed from former vicious
Courses, and becoming in a singular manner Continent, we have reason to
presume, that God was not wanting to them in affording the like Power to them
before; but they rather wanting to the Grace of God, and to themselves.

4. Lastly, Since many, that certainly have from God the power to contain, (as
the Divorced, the one party, when the other is debilitated,) yet do not; or
with some difficulty, yea more perhaps than the never married have, (because
these have been otherwise accustomed, and not without temptations to the
contrary) do contain, it seems, that none can gather (neither the Delinquent
nor others) from not containing, or from some difficulty therein, that he has
not power from God to contain, unless also he use means; nor, in using the
means, can he certainly know it yet, unless certain that he has used all the
means, and in that manner these as he ought. Hence none can say, that any of
those, who vowing Chastity proved afterward incontinent, had not power to
contain. Or, if he perceives, that as yet he has not the power, yet knows he
not, whether for the future he may not receive it: as many do, that, of
debauched, yet without Marriage, at length become chaste. Therefore can none
gather from an Act of Uncleanness, or Fornication committed by him, that he
cannot have the Gift of Continency for the future. Or that absolutely, from one
such experience of himself, he is obliged to marry. But it remains still true
concerning him, as well as others: that as it is melius nubere, quam uri; so it
is melius Continere, quam nubere; If then at length he shall seriously attempt
to quench such Burning with Prayers, Solitude, Fasting, etc. the prime and more
noble, rather than by Wedlock, the second, and much inferior, remedy. I have
dilated the more on this Virtue, to show the many advantages, Spiritual and
Temporal, that are attained by it: and that none, using the means, are excluded
from it.

18.
4. Of Loves and Affections to earthly Things.
1. Avoiding (and that in their first growth) sensual Loves, or Enamour'dness
of any Earthly Person, or Thing. Avoiding the contraction of particular
Friendships amongst your usual Associates, extraordinary Familiarities, zealous
addiction to Parties: nothing being so opposite to the Loves we are obliged to,
( viz. to the love of God toto cord, and totis viribus; and again to a general
love, and charity to all God's Creatures for his sake,) as these Monopolies of
our Love, and this inordinate concupiscential affection settled on some
particular, when it is grown to some excess. Of which love the greater share
any one has, the less have all the rest; and so much as is given to the
Creature, that is not secondary and merely for God, so much is taken from the
Creator. Besides that this is the Master-passion, and none grows to such an
immense unruly Bulk as it. Whether it be good, or bad, its bands are very
strong; strong as death says the Spouse in the Canticles, death that lets none
escape: and it imploys all our faculties that way whither it tends; and so is
most pernicious to us, when not rightly placed: No other thing so powerfully
inducing us to transgress our necessary duty to God or Man, and so much
unmanning us, and robbing us of our liberty.

2. Weaning your self by degrees from all worldly Consolations the readiest way
to attain Spiritual; i. e. Consolations greater, longer.

. 19.
5. Of secular Employments.
1. Quitting and dismissing, as much as you can, worldly cares, and much
temporal Affairs; The secular cares of most men being undertaken not for want
of necessarie^ for the present for them, or theirs; but for provision of
necessaries for the future (a thing to which our Lord saw our Infirmity very
liable, and forbad it. Matt. 6.32, 33, 34. Matt. 13.7.22. Luke 12.20. Jam.
4.13, 14.): And such cares proceeding, partly from some distrust of the divine
Providence; cured by casting our selves upon it, and so experiencing the
goodness thereof: partly, from the overvaluing the good things of this world,
and not well apprehending the felicities and contents of a low condition; cured
by much practice of devotion, which affords solaces that much transcend mundane
delights. When worldly cares of necessary provisions are dismissed; yet much
temporal affairs, by reason of much-customed Trading, or Offices of great
charge, or (apprehended) Obligations of Charity to our Neighbor, etc. still
molest us; and are commonly the last snare of this world, wherewith a man of
good Intentions is catched; whilst, by this serving God in our Vocation, we
neglect to serve him in Prayer: (which frequentation of Prayer is an employment
more spiritual, and to which men have much reluctance at the first, till more
accustomed to it;) and, by doing some good (as we apprehend) necessary to our
Neighbor, we omit the while a good, more necessary, to our selves. I mean the
Converse with God in our Devotions: yet, without which, we can no way endure
long in the performance of any other service of him, so as we ought, and
without incurring many faults, and failings: and we are but like those, who are
so eager on their work, as that they will not take their necessary sustinence
for doing it; or like those that set up Trading without a Stock. Of several
things, therefore, that present themselves under the appearance of doing good,
that which is to be preferred, especially by those who are not yet arrived to
much perfection, is doing good to our selves; and that, first in Spirituals;
and this, first by frequent and long converse with God in Prayer: (for a short
time of Prayer does not obtain, or produce many beneficial effects, and solaces
thereof, which are enjoyed from a large time spent therein; especially by
those, not yet arrived to any great habit of Piety): and this Prayer requires
solitude, and coadmits not so much other employment as many charge themselves
with; requires also recollection, and freedom from those distractions in
performing it which much business usually interjects.

2. Ridding your self of, or dispatching with all speed, such occurring secular
affairs as cause some extraordinary anxiety, a great impediment in Prayer. And
for the same reason declining such secular employments as much transcend your
ordinary ability.

3. Dividing the day, and allotting a set portion thereof for your temporal
Affairs; not easily to be enlarged, or the hours thereof changed.

4, Devolving (though perhaps with some loss of gain) some part of your
business upon another; and well observing, Whether it be not any cogent
necessity, but Covetousness, Ambition, or some other inordinate Lust, that
o're-imploys you; Whether another may not do, what we, better, or as well, or
sufficiently; or whether inconsiderable, that such things be done at all; and
whether my engrossing much work, whilst it deprives me of necessary leisure,
does not deprive my Neighbor of necessary employment.

5. Choosing, in order to God's better service (when it is in our power) rather
such a vocation, or employment, as is less tempting to sin (as some be much
less than others), or is less mingling with, and engaging, us in, Company, and
the world; (See 1. Cor. 7.21.) less full of business, less difficult in its
work, a less hindrance to Solitude.

Digr. 1. Of the great danger of some Vocations; and among these commonly of
those more wealthy, and less corporally laborious; of those less necessary, and
ministering to pleasures: and of those generally, wherein the flesh, and the
world (i. e sensuality, gain, or converse,) have more scope to tempt us. For
true wisdom does discern those persons here in most peril as to their future
(i. e. eternal) estate, who are, here, most prospering; ande contra pitties the
Wealthy's honor, and ease, envies the Poor's labor, and contempt.

Digr. 2. Of great caution to be used concerning Studies and all intellectual,
and speculative, employments; and of their special hindrance of devotion (more
than other Vocations do) if not discreetly used; because in them those
faculties are busily employed, which in others are (in part at least) left
vacant, and free, to attend upon God: And because some of them, by the near
alliance they seem to have to devotion (as when the Brain is employed in the
study of Divinity) do seem privileged hereby to entrench upon the times
sequestered for it, and to pass in our account instead of Prayer; whenas yet the
subtle speculations of the Intellect in these matters have little or no effect
upon the Will, or to the producing of those acts of love wherein consists the
life of Prayer; and, whilst charitas adificat, scientia inflat: Lastly, Because
much employment of the Brain is apt to molest us more with distractions, and
extravagations, in our Devotions.

The Acceptableness of a Confident reliance on God's Providence for Necessaries
6. For all necessaries much relying on, and trusting to, God's Providence,
which though, in the way of working many times (to exercise Faith) it is much
disguised, yet evidently appears in the effect to those, who not only speak of
it, but try, and also need it. Extended to all men, not only to Christians; to
Beasts ( Psalm. 104.21.27. -- 36.6. Matt. 6.26.) not only to men; and nothing so
small, wherein it has not a hand: For men, extended to hairs, their number,
and color ( matt. 10.33. -- 5.36.); for Beasts to the life and death of a
Sparrow, to the clothing of a Grass, and the beauty of a Flower. Matt. 10.19.
-- 6.29, 30; Yet, far more particularly (as I may so say) in its effects
watching over the necessities of God's own servants (as to whom this
paterfamilias has a nearer relation): and that, not only of their Body, but of
the Soul, much more: for the supplying, in all honest, and pious attempts, its
indigencies, and any thing wanting, either in the Will to effect, or in the
Understanding to direct. And of this providence every one, according to his
greater service, may so much more presume. Only provided, that as Deus non
deficit in necessariis, so they should not expect, that he should in this
world, to his children, whose inheritance is in the next, abundare in
superfluis: nor, secondly, That they should in any thing tempt his Providence
by their duty viciously neglected (which they are to perform still, in
obedience to his Precept, though not, in distrust to his Provision). For all
justice it is, that he, who provideth for the growth of a hair, should suffer
him, who does not labor, to want what to eat.

7. Retaining a resigned indifferency in all things; whether for increasing, or
also for conserving, what you have.

8. Not entertaining any long, or great, designments, present, or future.

Digr. Of the danger, and needlessness, of Worldly Cares.

. 20.
6. Of Meat and Drink.
1. Avoiding full Diet, frequent Repasts, Feasts, etc. especially strong
drinks, hurting the Brain, and Understanding, heightning, and disordering your
Passions ( Ephesians. 5.18.) therefore expressly forbidden by God to the Priest in the
time of attendance on him ( Lev. 10.9.) And all Christians are now in some
manner God's Priests Rev. 5.10. But on the contrary, in a spare Diet, and the
disuse of strong drink, the Passions become much more moderate; all
concupiscential loves, and affections much abated; the judgment much more
clear, serene, and circumspect; the thoughts more grave, sober, and serious;
our words fewer, and better weighed; the person more humble, and tractable; the
heart more tender, and melting, and fitlier prepared for prayers, sighings, and
tears; the Motions of the Holy Spirit more vigorous, and sooner hearkened to;
and its Consolations more frequent, when the body, and flesh (with which it
wageth a perpetual war Gal. 5.17.) is rendered, by a competent abstinence, poor
and low: which also is seen in Beasts made tame, gentle, and manageable by
nothing so soon as hunger, and withdrawing their food.

2. For the better preserving of Temperance, refusing invitations, and
entertainments abroad; not making them at home.

3. Not long sitting at Meals, sitting down later, or rising from table sooner,
than others.

4. Not eating between set Meals.

5. Eating (at your Meals) alone.

6. Eating a set proportion; a divided portion, when in company.

7. Indifferent as to your diet, or choosing the meanest, and forbearing
delicacies; which, besides the mortification of your senses, and appetite
herein, much conduces to a necessary temperance; we being less apt to exceed
in that wherein we take less goust, and pleasure. Not making your meat, or
drink the subject of your Discourse; or finding fault at that time with the ill
Cookery of it, things that savor of sensuality. Often calling to mind the
usual mean fare of our Lord and his Disciples; Corn-ears --, Barley-bread --,
Fish --, an Honeycomb --, Water. Matt. 12.1. Jo. 6.9. Luke 24.41. Jo. 21.9.
Matt. 7.10. Jo. 4.7. and the all-satiating refection promised in heaven to
those who mortify their flesh here; and often saying with the Pharisee's Guest,
Blessed are they that shall eat bread in the Kingdom dome of God, Luke 14, 15.
Matt. 8.11. Matt. 26.29. And blessed are they, that are called to the
marriage-supper of the Lamb, Rev. 19.9. And, of your present perishing food,
God shall destroy both the Belly, and the Meats, Jo. 6.27. 1. Cor. 6.13.

8. Taking great care (because then is greatest danger) of your Conversation
at, and presently after, meals: by reason of the Flesh new armed as it were
with provision for its fighting against the Spirit; Concupiscence strengthened;
the Spirits refreshed, and inclined to mirth; and this to talkativeness, and
discourse; the Brain, less, or more, heated, and so not making so perfect a
judgment of things; engaged in company (by the same refreshment) of the same
Inclinations.

9. Not being too solicitous of preserving your Health. Knowing, that upon this
pretense usually the flesh obtains all her lusts, and desires; arms its self
against the Spirit; and we fearing to lose our health by withdrawing some
necessaries, do often hazard the losing it by excess, and forego the benefit of
the most profitable mortification, that this life affords, the taming of our
flesh. But indeed, death being to all those, who continue in God's service, and
their duty, the beginning of their happiness, and true life, we ought in all
things to have more regard to the bettering, than the lengthning of our life
here; seeing that a long life is, by most, no otherwise to be wished, but as
they presume that it may be better than the present; And that we have but
little reason to presume of this, if, to to make it longer, we omit some of the
chiefest means to make it better. For such abstinences therefore, as we do
suspect may some way impair health, the best way is, to guide our selves by
experience, rather than by our own, or others, prognostications, and fears; and
with some courage at first to make trial of such hard-ships; and (since health
is not destroyed in a moment) to continue them so long till nature complains
(and that, not if at the very first there appear some reluctance; but, if after
some reasonable time of trial she sinketh under them) of which nature will mind
us soon enough, when she cannot support our rigors; and which, do what we can
against her, will even force so much supply from us as is necessary for her
preservation. And if, in such good purposes in subduing our flesh, we should
make some oversight, yet is it no further accountable for, than it is
discernable; and then it is soon enough to change our custom; specially if
disallowed by those, whose judgment in this matter we have reason to yield to,
or also are obliged to obey: in a due submission to which their Injunctions,
instead of our Flesh, we are to mortify (which is a harder thing) our Will.

10. Keeping a perpetual guard, and watch upon your self more for this virtue
of Temperance, than any other: the mischiefs of which transgressed are so
many, and yet the occasions thereof, by reason of our Bodies necessary daily
repairs, returning daily; nor can we quite cut off, and dismiss them, as we can
do in most other temptations to Sin, which the Holy Father St. Austine in his
Confessions observed and complained of long ago. I therefore (says He) placed
among the same temptations, am striving every day against this concupiscence,
in eating, and in drinking. For it is no such thing which I can resolve to cut
off at once, and touch no more, as I could do concerning other things.
Therefore are the reins of the Throat to be held with a moderate hand, between
relaxation, and restraint. And who is he, O Lord, who is not sometimes
transported beyond the lists of necessity? Whoever he be a great one he is, let
him magnify thy Name. Nor, Secondly, In the use of them, to which we are
frequently necessitated, can we perfectly discern in our diet the true limits
of too little, enough, and too much; which thing caused a second Complaint of
the same pious Father. Many times it becomes uncertain (says He) whether it is
the necessary care of my Body that requires such a supply; or the voluptuous
deceit of my lust, that procures such a maintenance from me; and the unhappy
Soul grows glad in such an uncertainty; and thence prepares the protection of
an excuse, rejoicing that it appears not, what is an exact proportion for the
welfare of the Body, that under the cloak of health it may cover the matter of
delight. Nor is there any way of receiving these cures of our wants, without a
tempting pleasure joined with it. The Father's third Observation and trouble.
For, -- Whilst I am passing from the trouble of emptiness to the rest of
fullness, my Concupiscence lays a snare for me. For this passage it self is a
pleasure; nor is there any other way to pass to it but this to which necessity
forces me. And thus whereas health only is the true cause of eating, and
drinking, yet there accompanies it, as its handmaid, a perilous jucundity, and
goust, which most what endeavors also to step before it; that for the Pleasures
sake I should do, what I pretend, or also desire, to do only for Health's sake.
Nor are both of these content with the same allowance: That, which is
sufficient for health, being too little for delight.

Digr. 1. Of the great Benefit from constant spare-diet, Fasting, etc, and much
practiced by Holy Men for the many advantages received by it. There never
wanting an occasion thereof, whilst the Flesh any way rebelleth against the
Spirit, i.e. whilst we live. By which also is gained a considerable time,
whilst others are thus diverted, for solitude, reading, and prayer; whilst
otherwise, as much time also after our meat, vacant from other employments, is
required for digestion of our food, as for receiving it. To say nothing here of
some part of God's provision by Fasting spared for those, who perhaps more need
it.

Digr. 2. Of God's Providence for our health, and sustaining the Body, as he
pleases, with the same power he made it, upon any oversight our zeal to his
better service may unwittingly make therein.

Where, Of the Happiness of Old Age.
Digr. 3. Of the happiness of long life, and old age, which is ordinarily the
effect of temperance. Its happiness I say, if it be guided by reason, and make
use of those helps conducing to Salvation, which God has abundantly afforded
it. For our first days are days, in comparison of our last, as it were of no
account: full of ignorance, and unexperience; cosened with toys and false
shows; divided between folly, and sin; we in it with our first Father, trying
good, and evil to our ruin. But the person, who has through these fallacies
attained to old age, is, in his last days, by the long tract of time, and a
different truer survey of things long perused, by the certainly known approach
of our death, and sudden departure hence, invited, and (if true reason be
followed) inclined, to be prudent, penitent, patient, easily contemning and
slighting what others as yet admire, and not desiring what he does or does not
possess; devout, and much taken up with the nobler thoughts of Eternity. Again,
is, By reason of the decays of nature, and of concupiscence, of the senses, and
appetite, (when God seems as it were to have drawn the Curtain between us and
temptation, and shut out all those enticements to offend him, with which our
youth is molested,) freed from the sins of the flesh, and sensuality: Is, by
reason of the many cheats, and deceits of the world experienced by him, the
transitoriness of its pleasures, mutability of friendships, hazards, and
frequent cadencies from wealth and honors, is, I say, taken no more with its
flatteries, and waineth himself from it, as not being indeed what once it made
show of: And, by reason of its eyes now turned from him another way, and
despising his autumn, and its former court-ships withdrawn from him, is
necessitated to more recollection, and solitude, and dwelling at home. Is,
again, By reason of death, and his departure from hence ( naked, and stripped of
all,) most certainly at hand, dissuaded from Covetousness, and hoarding any
more of the world's goods, and invited to all works of bounty, and charity, and
dispersing of his substance (so that, in reason, a covetous old man should be a
Monster); and, By reason also of his approaching passage to Eternity, and going
into another life, strongly invited to devotion, and the making some
acquaintanec beforehand with God, and Heaven. Is, By reason of Sin's appearing
now no more unto him with a painted face, but in its own natural colors, and
deformity, after the Instruments of it decayed, and goustless, the pleasures
spent, and only a sting of conscience, and fear of punishment left behind, Is
(I say) much more flexible to repentance of it, and having a much greater
aversion from it. Is, By reason of many Infirmities, and diseases within,
contempts, and affronts abroad, inured also to much patience, and necessitated
to great mortifications. So that if we measure the happiness of this life by
attaining the end of our Creation, the serving of God in Holiness, Innocence,
and Virtue, we find, cross to the Poet, That pessima quaeque dies miseris
mortalibus aevi prima venit: Subit hinc prudens, pia, docta, Senectus. Nor is
the former virgour of the Body, in youth, so desirable, as the imperfections of
the Soul to be loathed: nor would any wise man, were it in his power, be
content to forego all the improvements of the one, to have repaired to him all
the decays of the other. It Is true indeed, that the more miserable, and blind,
and molested with temptations the days of our youth are, the greater miracle,
and more estimable is a Holy young man; and such happy in his death also, when
it prevents old age; Ne forte malitia mutaret intellectum. But yet, he also by
arriving to old age (only if persevering) is to be pronounced much happier: as
accumulating his reward and glories in heaven by his good works so much longer
multiplied here.

. 21.
7. Of Sleep.
1. Not indulging your self much Sleep; considering, that if we may number our
life by the full enjoyment and use of our sensitive, and rational, faculties,
we no longer truly live, than we are awake; and that it is in our power so much
to lengthen our life, as we shorten our sleep; at least, that so much of it
only is beneficial to us as men, and as Christians, wherein we are awake to
perform those duties here, for which we live, and to be rich in good works, and
execute the end of our Creation. Considering also the strict account which must
be made of time; and the shortness of that time, after which no man [to all
eternity] can work the least thing to better his condition. Lastly considering,
That watching and abridging sleep very much tames the flesh, and, in the
deficiency or less activity of our Spirits, produces much what the same
effects upon it as Fasting; renders us less disposed to vain mirth and jollity;
and more inclined to silence, gravity, recollection, etc. much Activity being
seldom innocent. And Piety as to much secular entertainments and affairs
resembles an holy Somnolency.

2. Measuring your rest and sleep by time (not satiety); and then breaking it
off with violence. Sleep, and Lust will not be treated with. This time by no
means to exceed Eight hours, i. e. the third part of your life. More than which
he that spends in sleep unjustly complains of want of time; especially if for
Prayer, our most important business. Holy men have limited it for whole
Societies, within the Seventh. And those, in a higher degree temperate, have
contracted sleep (I mean always such a proportion thereof, as satifies nature
for an undrowsy dispatch of our daily business) to yet fewer hours for
themselves, to Five, Four, or perhaps less: for less sleep is necessary as our
diet is more temperate; and fasting best remedies its excesses; and by this
means adds some hours each day to our life; our life; i. e. that short time,
which we are allowed here on earth to purchase for our selves a happy Eternity.
Sleep also, as it is shortened, after some practice becomes more profound, and
has in depth what it wants in length; and so also, is freer from troublesome,
and foolish dreams. To a moderate and equal Diet may be also added a hard bed
for the same effect; we being not so apt to exceed in that which supplies our
necessities without delight.

3. Beginning the time allotted for your rest as soon as you conveniently can
in the evening, that in those morning and best hours, which the world abroad
usually bestows on their repose, you may enjoy the more freedom for your
negociations with God, not importuned with company or secular Business. As
going to bed at Nine or Eight at night, and rising in the morning at Five,
Four, or Three, if in the Summer-season.

4. Repelling secular thoughts; and praying when, in bed, you are indisposed to
rest, or sleep, (which is perhaps, to some, by reason of our weakness, and
dis-affection to Spiritual matters, the best art they can use to fall asleep
quickly) 1. Pet. 4.7. Col. 4.2. Psalm. 6.6. -- 4.4.

5. In the morning not keeping your bed longer than sleeping, for fear of evil
thoughts. As also composing your self in bed with all decency and modesty, as
being in the presence of, and beheld by, God, and his Holy Angels.

6. Watching sometimes on nights to Prayer, and Devotion, tho you make some
repairs of sleep for it in the day. The less distraction of sense by variety of
objects, the silence of midnight and terror of darkness much helping devotion.
And most leisure then from business; therefore night-devotions much used by our
Lord, by his Apostles, by David, and other Saints. See Luke 6.12. Mar. 1.35.
Matt. 14.23.25. Act. 16.25. -- 2. Cor. 6.5 -- 11.27. Luke 2.37. Act. 12.12.
comp. 6. Psalm. 63.6. -- 7.3. -- 16.7. -- 119.62.148. Esa. 26.9. Luke 12.37, 38.
Matt. 13.37. Act. 20.31. Ephesians. 6.18. Performing this half-clothed upon your bed,
rather than omit it.

7. The later your serious conversion to God happens to be, using so much the
more diligence these ways in redeeming so much former lost time.

. 22.
8. Of Recreation and Vacancy from Employment.
1. Not indulging your self much time of leisure, and vacancy from business,
and no way predisposed of. In desiderio est omnis otiosus.

2. Easing tediousness with variety, and change of labors.

Digr. 1. Of the many dangers from Idleness, and non-imployment.

Digr. 2. The benefit of diligently following some constant Vocation, by which
all Sin is excluded.

. 23.
9. Of Company and secular Converse.
1. Not seeking acquaintance, no way necessary to us; nourishing idleness, and
the neglect of our Vocation; (a temptation to make visits, and go much abroad;
an occasion of entertainments, vain expense, and intemperance; and, as many
times an effect, so a cause, of ambition, and desire to be known;) whereby we
subject our selves to new obligations, and laws, I mean, of secular Civilities,
pretended to belong to the duty of friendship: not well consistent with those
laws of God, to which we owe an indispensable observance. Ungrateful Friendship
that to please a less Friend offends a greater!

2. Abstaining from much conversation, and frequenting of company. Cavete ab
hominibus for you will get no good by them. Matt. 10.17. And, Totus mundus
positus in maligno 1. Jo. 5.19. Of the Contagion of which the Philosopher
Seneca observed; Nunquam mores, quos extuli, refero; aliquid ex eo quod
composui, turbatur. Ambitiosior redeo, luxuriosior etc. For it being certain,
that the most of men (and consequently of company) are unwise, are ungodly,
Hence follow; A Partaking (as being their companions) more or less of their
sins; (which may be shared with them many ways, as by our counselling and
advising, so by applauding and approving, or by consenting to, or by
concealing, or by mear silence, and not reproving; them. 2. Jo. 11. Lev. 19.17.
Matt. 18.15. Luke 17.3. Ephesians. 5.11. Gal. 6.1. and by this partakers also we are
not unoften of their punishments:) Temptation, and Contagion, from their
Example: A faulty compliance of the ear in hearing many things hurtful to good
manners, injurious to the absent, etc. A faulty compliance of the tongue, in
speaking what may please to retain their good affection; or, in not admonishing
them of their faults: Loss of time for prayer, and converse with God;
conversation rendering us, when not vicious, idle (Amici fures temporis): But
chiefly, (if we are not thoroughly reformed) our danger, in society, of giving
(which much aggravates our sin) as well, as of receiving, ill Example.

3. Especially taking heed of too much conversation with kindred, or with
friends; from whom whilst we often receive much seducement, and mischief, yet
we either think it a duty, or our near relation an excuse, to comply with,
indulge, and observe, them. Which indeed is, in complaisance and civility to
our friend, to show unkindness and ingratitude to God; from whom also we
receive even all that good which we enjoy in our Friends.

4. Not thinking to frequent company especially where numerous (except you are
much confirmed in virtuous habits) out of a purpose to convert them, or better
them, (when as indeed we are oftener some way or other perverted by them): Or,
out of a hope to be bettered by them; which are two great temptations of Satan.

5. Not indulging the pretense of a natural inclination to melancholy, or to
some other infirmities of the Body: which is to be remedied by mirth, and
sociableness; the ordinary Plea with which Satan, and the Flesh, are wont to
deter us, from using any advantages to Piety; when as, he who takes care of the
food and raiment, much more does of the Body, and Health, in the things we
undertake for his better service: or if not, thrice happy they that lose them
in it.

6. When permitted a free election of your company, consorting and conferring,
rather with one or two than a greater number; whereby more benefit may be made
of Society. None being either so willing to learn of, or free to give advice
to, a many, as one; discourse also is thus kept from much extravagancies, or
confusion (usual among many Interlocutors); and more applicative to your
particular, and not so general. Many times also vain glory, in much company,
misguides men's intentions, to speak what may please, rather than profit; and
Piety and Religion are very shame-face't to appear in a multitude, either for
fear, of receiving from the ill-disposed some check; or, of desiring to seem
popular. This sorting your self, and conferring rather with a few is
recommended, supposing you, and your company, well inclined; but if otherwise,
the more privacy your conversation has, the more danger, and hurt there is in
it: The reverence we have of a multitude being some curb to the liberty of our
tongue, to wicked discourses, to detraction, divulging things we ought not etc.
Again, Consorting rather with those of your own Profession; of whom you may
learn, or to whom teach, something proper to you and them: or, with spiritual
persons; and those rather single; for the greater benefit receivable thereby:
and with your equals rather than superiors, if these not virtuously inclined;
because with these later your conscientious liberty may be restrained (1. Cor.
7.21.) or sometimes as it were forced, to a faulty compliance; in respect of
which the Proverb says, Qui a compagnon, a Maistre.

7. Abstaining (out of obligation, and conscience of offending God in it) from
having any familiar Society with such, as are open profane livers. Remembering
well 1. Cor. 5.11. I have written to you not to keep company if any man that is
called a brother be a Fornicator, or covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or
a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with such a one no not to eat [spoken not of
sacred Feasts only, but of usual diet]; to which some other places add, chiefly
any Heretical, or Schismattcal persons Romans 16, 17. 2. These. 3.14. Matt. 18.17.
-- 2 Jo. 10, 11. Where St. John commands that they be not admitted into our
house, or so much as saluted. And of this sequestring our selves from them
three reasons are given: 1 One in order to bettering of them; That they may be
ashamed. 2. These. 3.14. The other two in order to preserving our selves: 2 That
we may not be seduced, and deceived by them 1. Cor. 5, 6. Gal. 5.9. Romans 16.18.
And 3 That we may not be (as their associates) partakers of their sins: to
which may be added a 4th; Our giving some scandal thereby to others. Concerning
which see 1 Thessalonians. 5.22. Phil. 4.8. Upon this account the behavior of St.
Austine's Mother toward this her Son is very memorable. Austin's Confess. 3. l.
11. c. That whilst he continued a Manichaean, she would not eat with him. See
also 2. Cor. 6.14. etc. Nolite jugum ducere; Be not yoked together with
unbelievers etc. Come out from among them and be ye separate, and I will
receive you, and be a Father to you etc. [Which Text holds not only for
Unbelievers, and Idolaters, but all other open, profane, and wicked Livers; for
they are also unrighteousness, darkness, Sons of Belial etc]. Only, in any case
of necessity, as in public Prayers, in receiving the Communion etc, (where I
have an obligation to do my duty, and no power to exclude them); in trading
(where I cannot with others; and in some cases of their aedification,
especially to some persons, this prohibition obliges not: See 1. Cor. 5. verse.
10. fin. Matt. 9.12. -- 2 Thessalonians. 3.14. But else we are generally forbid also
ordinary, and civil Conversation with notorious Sinners, continuing impenitent
( i. e. continuing still in the custom, and practice of such a vice;) whenever
such our withdrawing from hinders not our necessary subsistence in the world.
1. Cor. 5.10. Neither does admonishing them 2 Thessalonians. 3.15. imply at all
keeping them company; Because this we ordinarily may do to those, with whom we
do not consort. Or if this be permitted to some persons, (as Physicians,) to
converse with these sick persons for their cure; Yet, most of these deseases by
reason of our carnality being so contagious, such a person must be one already
well confirmed in the practice of contrary virtues; least, the Antidotes he
has being too weak, instead of curing, he catch the Disease. And what is said
of companying may be much more of marrying, leaging with, or contracting other
obligatory relations to such persons, and thereby inheriting any divine
Maledictions belonging to them.

8. Taking care not to read any ill, or vain, Books: of which the very same
things may be said, as of keeping ill Company, Books being our ordinary company
when alone; and the mischief of them, when bad, very great.

9. As much as you can procuring a well employed Solitude: Recommendation of
Solitude.
which is most necessary for the great duty of this life, viz. Prayer and
Conversation with God; and cutts off at once those most frequent sins of the
tongue and the ear, and all the temptations of them. Solitude observes silence:
and, when alone, we neither blaspheme, nor swear, nor boast; are free from all
filthy, and corrupt Communication, from railing, slandering, detracting,
flattery; from scurrility and jesting, vain, and idle talk (of which also we
are to give account. Matt. 12.36;) are free also from hearing such things with
applause, assent, or silence.

Digr. 1. Of the many damages ordinarily received from company.

2. Of the great Sin of men-pleasing, and compliance, frequently miscalled
Civility.

3. Of the Sins of the Ear.

4. Of the power of Example.

5. Of the standing severity of God's laws no way mitigated by contrary
custom; nor sin in those places a less fault where more practiced.

6. Of the duty of Christians abstaining from, and having no common Society
with many sorts of people 1: Cor. 5.11. (which is ordinarily transgressed) and
especially of not marrying, or leaging etc, with them.

. 24
10. Of Discourse and Compliance.
1. In Conversation, avoiding all appearance of levity, laughter, and secular
Mirth, which contristates the Holy Spirit, and obstructs its Motions, excludes
sober thoughts, suits ill with God's presence, and a constant habit of Prayer;
which is built upon a false, and fleeting foundation, and savours of too much
sensuality, and gives to our treacherous nature a hurtful liberty that tends to
several Exorbitances, whereas in this world she should rather be always to some
degree curbed and mortified: Remembering the wise-man's censure of it Eccl 2.2.
I proved my heart with Mirth (says he): And I said of Laughter it is mad, and
of Mirth what does it? And, our Lord's woe Luke 6.25. See Eccl. 2.7. etc. to
the 8. -- Ecclesiasticus 21.20. But always retaining your self within a certain
degree of Gravity, which is ready to nourish any good motions of the Spirit, or
dictates of Reason (that are choked by Mirth:) and carries with it some
mortification of your sensitive faculties [ Cor sapientium ubi tristitia est
Eccl. 7.5.] and, if it were for nothing else, which is eligible for the
sobering of your company by your good example; per tristitiam vultus corrigitur
animus delinquentis Ib. v. 4. See 1. Tim. 3, 4.8.11. Tit. 2.2, 7. To this end
not using too much familiarity and intimacy with any. Charitas habenda est erga
omnes, familiaritas non expedit; least, by such amity, you be tempted to some
excess.

2. On the other side, avoiding melancholy, and sadness always; to be, or to
appear so; and being rather cheerful, and endeavoring always a spiritual mirth
ex. munditia cordis, in whatsoever external condition, Fructus Spiritus gaudium
Gal. 5.21. Rejoice always, and I say again, rejoice; but remember what follows
[in the Lord] with a spiritual, not secular joy [ Phil. 4.4. -- 1 Thessalonians. 5.16.
And the Apostle's always in all things give thanks Ephesians. 5.20. -- 1 Thessalonians.
5.18. implies the same; who gives thanks is well pleased: and why ought they
not to be always giving thanks, quibus omnia vertuntur in bonum Romans 8.18.?
Omnis anxietas ex maligno.

3. Avoiding in your discourse (...), and (...), scurrility, foolish talk, and
jesting, buffonery, and superfluous facetiousness quae ad rem non pertinent
(says the Apostle Ephesians. 5.4.) and the speaking things any way apt to invite
laughter, and affectation of wit, which is seldom innocent and free from Sin,
because it borrows its matter chiefly from the faults, or (which is worse) the
infirmities of other men, the abuse of persons, or things sacred, and is
ambitious of pleasing men, though this purchased with the offending of God, and
also of men. Not studying in such wicked, or at least vain, and idle, talk, how
to be more expensive of that, of which must be rendered so strict an account. In
your Conversation, though with intimate friends, using an holy reservedness,
and not turning your inside outward, and taking liberty to speak all that comes
into your thoughts. For, most Christians having many imperfections, the most of
their thoughts must be weak, and unrefined; and even those persons, more
perfect, do, in the first surreptitious cogitations of any thing, usually
apprehend it according to Nature, not Grace or the Spirit, unless some
pre-consideration be used. Those must not be too open-hearted, who have little
good there. And, though dissembling and speaking contrary to what we think is
never lawful, yet the not concealing much of that which we think, and not
keeping our own secrets much more warily, than other men's, is a sign of little
prudence; and, since all men's judgments in many things disagree, the not
hiding, but disclosing, things that are offensive, much weakneth friendship.

4. Not talking much (especially in much company, to which when numerous is due
more reverence, and modesty, Ecclesiastieus 7.14. -- 32); but as one that has
resolved silence, and breaks it only upon necessity; For, In the multitude of
words there wants not sin, Prove. 10.19. And again; He that uses many words
shall be abhorred; and he that takes to himself authority therein shall be
hated. Ecclesiasticus 20.8. And, He that has knowledge, spares his words etc.
Prove 17.27. Not engaging in every discourse, and speaking to every matter: Nor
speaking at all times what you know, but what is necessary: loving herein the
praise of God rather than of men: and God will reward you for it: A prudent man
concealeth knowledge; but the heart of fools proclaims foolishness Prove.
12.23. And, A fool utters all his mind, but a wise man keeps it in. Prove.
29.11. And, Keeps silence knowing his time; and till he sees opportunity.
Ecclesiasticus, 20.6, 7. And, The mouth of a wise man is in his heart, but a
fool's heart in his mouth. Ecclesiasticus 21.16. And, A fool travelleth with a
word as a woman in labor of a child; and as an arrow sticks in a man's
thigh, so is a word within his belly.

5. Not speaking hastily without pre-consideration, and lifting up your soul
first to God, that you may speak nothing that may displease him; and, in
matters of moment, first in your thoughts asking Council of him, when you
cannot delay an answer so long as to ask it in your Prayers; following herein
the pious Example of Nehemiah, 2. c. 4, 5. Knowing, that words are many times
things of the greatest consequence, and no external sins occur so often as
those of the tongue; knowing that there are two fountains within us of our
thoughts, and speeches, Nature and Grace or the Spirit; and their Dictates
contrary: and nature commonly preventing the other in her Suggestions, and our
second, our better, thoughts: Weigh thy words in a balance, and make a door
and a bar for thy mouth. Prepare what to say, and then shall thou be heard;
bind up instruction, and then make answer. Ecclesiasticus, 28.25. -- 33.4. And,
The words of such as have understanding are weighed in a balance.
Ecclesiasticus, 21.25. And, The heart of the Righteous studieth to answer
(says the wise man) Prove. 15.28. And lastly, See thou a man (says he) that
is hasty in his words, there is more hopes of a fool than of him, Prove. 29.20.

6. Not speaking verbously; but, as much as you can, contracting your sense. If
silence ordinarily makes none, less talk makes fewer, oversights. Let thy
speech be short comprehending much in few words, and be as one that knows,
and yet holds his peace, Ecclesiasticus, 32.8. And, A fool is known by
multitude of words. Ecclesiasticus, 5.3.

7. Not speaking vehemently, or passionately, but so, as it may be accompanied
with, and mastered, or checked, by your judgment; which much passion clouds,
and troubles. Not using your self to exaggerate any thing, to hyberbolize and
exceed the truth (though a common custom): but moderating your expressions,
and rather speaking the least. Not delivering things with much asseveration, by
this, as it were, to add more weight, and authority to your words; which, if
there be any fault in what we say, makes it much greater. All these things
savor of pride, self-love, vain glory, men-pleasing; and the contrary, of
discretion, moderation, and humility. For this often remembering our Lord's holy
Lesson, Matt. 5.37. Let your Communication be yea, yea, nay, nay; and his note
upon it, Quod autem his abundantius est, a Malo est. Iterated also by St. James
5. c. 12. v. with this Caveat, least you fall into condemnation [ i. e. some
guilt, or other, condemnable.]

8. Avoiding much ceremony, and dissimulation, and compliance (the later
corruptions of Christian simplicity.) When our words swerve from our hearts,
our actions again do so from our words; and so we only fall at last into the
more shame and confusion. Avoiding these, I say, so far as this may expose you
to any temptation, or peril of offending God, your best, your highest, friend,
and always one of your company; not professing your self to be what you are not
(which is lying): or, what you ought not to be (which is disloyalty to God to
be loyal to your Friend) Nihil deformius, quam Scenam in vitam transfer,
especially for a Christian: [Membra Christi, Templa Spiritus Sancti, Filii Dei]
Nolite fieri servi hominum 1. Cor. 7.23. If we have so little esteem for the
world within, why show we so much without; or any further, than Christian duty,
and charity obliges us for God's sake? See Jo. 5.41.44. -- 12.43. Romans 12.2.
Jud. 1.6. v. Jam. 1.10. -- 1. Cor. 7.22. -- 2. Cor. 11.20. -- 1. Cor. 9.19. St.
Paul's becoming omnia omnibus was only omnia licita; and, not this done on any
terms, but (first being a perfect Saint, and running no hazard in using these
licita) ut plures lucrifaceret: But we, that are unperfect, may not venture so
far, when we hazard, instead of gaining others, the losing our selves.

9. 1 In company forbearing the relating, or inquiring after news, stories,
other-mens affairs, impertinent, and no way concerning us; ( distractions of
the mind, and commonly ending in censure, and detraction,) especially
concerning great persons, and public Magistrates of whom we ought to think,
and speak with great reverence. Carefully avoiding the first engagement in such
discourses, easilier wholly abstained from, than discreetly moderated. See 1.
Tim. 5.13. -- 1. Pet. 4.15. Psalm. 73.9. Meddle not with many matters; for in
meddling much thou shall not be innocent. Ecclesiasticus, 11.10. And, If thou
have heard a word let it dye with thee; and be bold, it will not burst thee.

9. 2 Forbearing any presaging of future events, and reverencing in all things
God's Counsels and Providence, which often works contrary to probable
conjectures, and likeliest appearances of things.

10. Not speaking, reprehending, or contradicting, and disputing, in your own,
or others, anger; or when you, or they, are any other way distempered. 1. Not
in your own anger, because then you are apt to make a false judgment of things,
neither will your reprehension, or contradiction be performed with that
moderation and discretion it should be: Nor, if it be so, yet does it appear so
to, or has the same weight with, the reprehended, because they see you angry:
but stay a little in silence, and let your passion cool; and by and by things
will have another appearance, and faults seem now of a less magnitude than they
did before; so that he, who resolves not to find fault in his anger, will much
seldomer find fault; and when he does, will do it more moderately, and his
reproof be more justly proportioned to the Sin. 2. Nor replying or
reprehending, in another anger. For neither then do their errors, faults, or
oversights appear to them so great as they are; and besides your reproofs, at
such time, receive ill answers from them, and these serve to kindle anger in
your self also where there was none before. But when their passion is cooled,
they more clearly see the greatness of their fault; and so, more profitably,
and patiently, receive your reproof, and counsel. Much caution therefore has
the wiseman given concerning this passion. The discretion of a man (says he)
deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. Psalm.
19.11. And, He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: He that is slow
to anger is better than the mighty; and he that rules his Spirit, than he that
takes a City. Prove. 16.32. -- 14.29. And on the other side: A fool's wrath is
presently known. Ps. 12.16.

11. Not contending, and striving in words with any one, for any thing: but
abstaining from second answers and replies (though most reasonable), after
that, by some resistance made, the person at that time seems indisposed; and,
imagining that we look after victory, has shut the Gate to Reason. It is not
passion, but gentleness, on truth's side, that overcomes passion on the other;
and, in such meekness, the victory is only deferred, not lost: And this, to
suffer our selves to be overborne when Reason is on our side, rather than
contend, especially in truths not so necessary to be maintained, is an act of
great mortification, and humility; and, whilst you yield to another, the
getting a great victory over your self; and we shall receive that praise from
God which we willingly for peace-sake lose with men. Yielding to all the world,
as much as you can, in point of opinion; and doing their will sooner, than your
own.

12. Not speaking any thing tending directly or indirectly to your own praise,
in earnest, or in jest, for greater matters or for trifles and such things as
are by you thought contemptible: For many times there lies herein a feather of
vain glory, tho not discerned by us; and many times to others it appears, and
gives offense. Not doing this, I say, unless when some extraordinary good may
come thereby; and then, delivering the matter spoken with much moderation,
apology, and humility; acknowledging the true author of it; and qualifiing it,
with relating your faults; always immediately repelling any praise given you by
others, God being only to be praised, so long as he is the Author of all Good.
So: generally speaking little of your self in any kind; of your business, of
your sufferings, etc. savouring of self-love, and tedious to others. But, upon
any good occasion given, despising, vilifying, condemning, your self,
especially when commended: from which thing you will find much benefit, and,
(were it worth any thing, or might you seek for it), more reputation, and a
great deal more esteem with those that hear you.

13. Not vindicating, or justifying your self, when receiving from your company
some slight defamations, and affronts; nor excusing your self when blamed; and
that, as you think unjustly: because self-love may blind you not to see a true
fault; or if it does not, yet some other way you deserve more blame than that
laid on you; to which, for mortification sake, you may apply it: always
remembering the most admirable silence of our Lord, in the questioning of his
most innocent life. This practice will encourage your friends the more to mind
you of your faults: And God undertakes our Justification, when innocent, much
more effectually than we can do it, when we, for humility, peace, and good
Example, desist from it.

14. Speaking of particular persons as little as may be; a thing seldom done
without some wrong to them: It being more pleasant to speak of other men's
faults than virtues; because by the one we seem to our selves advanced, by the
other depressed. Whether it be to friend, or foe, talk not of other men's
lives, says a wise man: But rather when there is occasion to speak of any
vice, speak what you have to say of it in general, and without application to
persons; or else in the first person, I or We; speaking evil of no man absent,
though a truth; though a truth well known: Excusing any as much as you can when
evil spoken of, from their ignorance, good intentions, strong temptations, or
the like. Always signifying an unwillingness to hear them ill spoken of, which
may perhaps discourage, and rectify the Relator (men usually forbearing to
speak, what they think does not please): or, at least, may preserve your own
innocence. Making no comparisons between persons; for seldom is the one of
them praised, but that the other is depressed. Especially, speaking always
reverently of holy things and persons, and generally of all persons in
authority, being our public Parents, and Benefactors, for whom we are obliged
particularly to pray (1. Tim. 2.2.) and who to us are in the place of God.
Taking heed of censuring their actions; which, being public, are more talked
of (and so we here to stand more upon our guard): and the true circumstances of
them, by inferiors, many times little understood; and, as being the actions of
persons above us, apt to be maligned, and envyed, and mis-related: Remembering
the terribledoom of those in 2. Pet. 10.11. and Jude 8, 9. who are not afraid
to speak evil of Majesty and Dignities; when as God's Officers, and Ministers,
the Angels themselves, for all their higher place, forbear to do it.

15. As much as you can, abstaining from secular discourse; and guiding, or
diverting it to, or at least mixing it with, something of Piety, of Spiritual
matters (which matters most concern all persons whatever), of God's honor, and
praise, in some, or other, of his Attributes, his wisdom, mercy, justice,
providence, omnipotency etc; to several of which every action in the world,
that we can talk of, has some near relation: Knowing that the glorifying God
on this manner is one of the chiefest ends of God's Creation of us, and
Ordination of them. Remembering the Apostle's Exhortation; Let such speech
proceed out of your mouth as is good to the edifying of Faith, that it may
minister Grace to the Hearers; and contristate not the Holy Spirit of God [that
continually inspires such good motions into you Ephesians. 4.29, 30.] by talking
secular impertinencies. And again; Let the Word of Christ dwell in you
abundantly in all wisdom, teaching, and admonishing one another, in psalms,
and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord;
and, whatsoever ye do in word, or work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus:
giving thanks to God, and the Father, by him. Col. 3.16, 17. And, Non
stultiloquium, aut scurr^litas, quae ad rem non pertinet, sed magis gratiarum
actio. [Domine totus mundus plenus est Te: and nescimus loqui de Te, vel ad Te.]

Recommendation of Silence.
16. Lastly in much company, so far as it may consist with your duty and
charity, accustoming your self to Silence: not caring to be accounted,
therefore, stupid, or ignorant, melancholic, or unsociable: by which Silence
we escape many sins of the tongue, and keep more calm our passions, and an
entire peace within our selves; as being free from others contradictions: (pax
animi, sil^ntium; Tace paulisper, and tumultus animi cito pertranseunt:)
whereby we better examine the cogitations, and fancies, that are continually
springing within us before they pass the gate of our lips, and judge many fit
to be suppressed, and stifled in the conception; whereby we better hearken to
the internal whispers and motions of God's Spirit: and, uningaged, can better
discern the value of others discourse: Lastly, holding our peace furnishes the
Soul with good thoughts, and is the way not to want that which may be said
profitably, and to purpose.

17. In Silence, not suffering your mind, to lie idle, or to dwell too much in
your ear (where the discourse of others is not pertinent. For he that will be
dumb, must also be deaf;) or, to wander whither it lists to other matters no
less vain than those you avoid, but keeping it at work; and putting your self
in another, and better company: I mean, conversing in your heart with God, who
is still with us, when we turn unto him; and goes not from us at all, but as we
recede from him: Reciting in your mind some Psalms, or other ready devotions,
(which will presently stop the course of your passion;) or your ears from your
Companion's impertinencies. To which purpose are those Scripture-Exhortations
of praying continually with perseverance, always in all things giving thanks,
rejoicing always, i. e. in the Lord; singing, and making Melody in our hearts
to the Lord; not quenching the Spirit. 1. These. 5.16, 17, 18, 19. Phil. 4.4.
Ephesians. 6.18. Col. 4.2. Ephesians. 5.20. Haec est enim voluntas Dei in omnibus vobis. 1 Thessalonians. 5.18.

18 All this that is to be observed in discourse, much more observing it in
letters, and writings; Acts more deliberate, more permanent.

Digr. 1. Of the numberless, and continually returning, (and many of them very
great) sins of Discourse.

Digr. 2. Of the innocence, many benefits, and advantages, of Silence.

. 25.
11. Of Extraordinary Abilities and Perfections, natural, or acquired.
1. Possessing with great jealousy, and fear, and mortifying, any more eminent
and extraordinary endowments of Soul or Body, natural, or acquired; as beauty,
strength, wit, memory, eloquence, learning, etc, by hiding them to avoid
praise, (where the exterior acts of them not necessary for deeds of charity,)
and God will exalt your humility, and more divulge (as he sees meet) what you
seek to cover. He walks in perpetual danger of ruin by pride, who has any
thing in him of extraordinary worth; and for him to assume any glorying from
this, is a high act both of ingratitude, and injustice, whilst whatever these
our good parts are they are God's free gift; and this Potter, as he pleases,
of the self same lump now makes one Vessel to honor, and then another to
dishonor; and is robbed of so much of his glory, as we, or others, give to us.

. 26.
12. Concerning the a voiding former, or common occasions of Sinning.
1. Diligently foreseeing, and avoiding, the formerly observed occasions of
sinning; being such, either to your self, or to most that have used them. As
(to name some) certain places; persons; times; feasts; stage plays; gaming;
strong drinks; such company; such discourse; such books; romances; etc: More
specially, taking heed of purposely administering to your self the occasions of
temptations; for so the very temptation to sin, being caused by your default,
becomes one; whilst, in praying every day to God, Lead us not into Temptation,
you lead your self into it.

2. Being more specially aware of those vices, to which natural temper, or your
calling, or the customs of the times, or the place, incline you. As young men,
of sensuality. Old men, of Avarice. An Innkeeper, of drinking to excess. A
Scholar, of self-conceit, and pride of judgment, etc.

3. Crossing often your appetite (your mind, as we say) in things purely
indifferent, and of less moment; that it may better obey in the rest.

4. Mortifying the memory, and imagination, from ruminating again and feeding
it self upon past, or present, finful, or worldly, pleasures, and secular
consolations, and hopes; being a great hindrance of our progress in Piety. (
Numb. 11.5, 6. Exodus 16.13. comp. Numb. 11.10. Luke 9.62.)

Digr. Of the great power of objects presented to the sense, for producing any
operation we desire in the Soul.

. 27
13. Resisting, first and small, Temptations.
1. Resisting not only great, and violent, but temptations small, and of less
moment; which, besides that they lead us unto higher, are so many, and so often
returning, that, unrepelled, they may bring a great guilt upon the Soul. Maxima
pendent ex minimis. Qui modica spernit, paulatim decidit. Blessed is the man
that fears always, Prove. 28.4. Now, the sooner we begin to resist, the less
strength we need to do it.

2. In the access of a temptation.

1. Removing it presently from you; or you flying from it; not disputing with
it (for what is kept in dispute is kept still in mind, and so tempts still).
Flying from it; either by hindering the presentment of it, or by diverting the
senses, or at least the mind, to some other thing. The surest remedy (but
requiring at first some valor and force to it) especially for intemperance,
lust, enamour'dness, anger, strife, or any high passion concerning secular
disturbances; Alla guerra del senso vincon I poltroni Nella guerrad amor chi
fugge vince. It Is a wonder to see how easily by this practice of running away,
the Devil is conquered, but by other ways of standing out in fight, not without
much trouble. In some Temptations it is necessary for conquering them not only
to divert the mind to something else, but to do the quite contrary: As
Temptations to Avarice are cured by giving much Alms: Fearfulness by putting
our selves on what we dread: And Vainglory, by some eminent act of
Self-contempt and secular Disgrace.

2. Turning and retiring your self presently to discourse with God, (the best,
holiest, and readiest way where ever you are, in company, or alone, of
diverting the mind;) Discoursing with him either by praying (in your mind)
against the present Temptation, by which you may hope for aid from him. Or
(since praying against a thing retains still the memory of it) by using some
other more general, and accustomed, devotions: As reciting in your mind the
Lord's Prayer, some Psalm which you have by heart, and can easily repeat. By
which the mind (not capable of intending two things at once) will soon let hold
go of its former object; And you shall happily change a Sin into an act of
Religion; and the Devil be a very great looser by his Temptation.

3. Meditating on our Savior's Passion, or on some one of the Quatuor
Novissima, especially that of your death, or that of future joys opposed to the
promised present pleasure of sin. Which future joys also may be advantagiously
represented to the Soul, as in the same kind of pleasure that the Temptation
is. Fallitur etiam dum sentit se falli.

4. 1 Using some Corporeal act, that puts you to some pain, which presently
calls off the mind to it; or some Act tending to Humiliation and Contrition. As
Crossing your self: Beating your Breast: Kissing the Ground: Contemplating a
Crucifix, or some devout Picture.

4. 1 Reflecting your thoughts on the like former actions of sin, and
considering what after-joys, or inconveniences, displeasures, and anxities
followed them. For hence your experience will quickly instruct you to choose
the good, and abhor the evil.

5. Considering, That God and his Angels look upon you now as in a Fight, ready
to applaud and crown your Victory, and Satan your Enemy ready to triumph in
your Fall: and that all your actions are registered in God's Book, and seem to
pass away; (yet without passing away;) and these once done (good, or bad)
follow you for ever.

6. If nothing else will cure you, delaying the execution: for most sins
prevail by importunity and prevention of the acts of jadgment, when there is
great plenty of reason on the other side. But by delay, if no external
accidents also (as they do many times) do intervene, yet reason gathers forces;
And the passions, naturally violent, are as little permanent; and such as time
destroys without any other enemy. Omnis cupiditas relanguescit. He that can
defer is safe.

7. Confessing your temptation presently to another, which is enough many times
to chase them away, by your, as it were, shaming the Devil, whose works hate
light, and are not able to abide the examining; and, by the good Counsel, which
a friend at that time is better able, than your self, to give you; or also by
your own reflections upon them, whilst you are performing this Action.

. 28.
14. Suppressing evil thoughts and first motions of Sin, etc.
1. Suppressing evil thoughts, and first motions of Sin; and all lesser sins,
that they lead you not into greater: esteeming no sin to be little; and the
most, to be the malicious suggestions of evil Spirits: which will make you the
more to abhor them.

2. Since thoughts may arise in you from three several Causes, 1 not only from
your self; but, 2 from the holy, or 3 from an evil, Spirit; Much observing, and
having a great reverence, or jealousy, of, them, according as they may seem to
proceed from the one, or the other of these external principles: The one
working more powerfully in all the Children of God; the other, in all the
Children of Disobedience; but both working, less, or more, (ordinarily), in
both good and bad men. And therefore great care and circumspection to be used
herein, what degree of perfection soever you seem to your self to have attained.

Digr. Of the sinfulness, and great pollution of the Soul by evil thoughts,
when long dwelt on, and not suddenly removed.

3. Suppressing, when we cannot the inward risings in the Soul, at least the
outward motions of passion in the Body; and endeavoring to hide them: which
indeed (all Passions being also bodily motions of the heart) is quenching them.

4. Suppressing (after guilty thoughts betrayed by some external passion) yet
the outward action, or any part thereof. These outward sins being far greater,
than those of the heart only; because, by the longer space of our
consideration, they have still more of wilfulness, and malice; require a more
intense act of the Soul to produce them; do more harm to others.

Ways to break ill Habits.
5. To overcome ill habits, contracted; or, to prevent prevent them, feared;
rather assaulting them singly, and bending all your force chiefly against one
only at a time, (there being ordinarily in every man some Master-Sin, (which a
many other serve, and the rectifying of which helps much for all the rest). In
the morning resolving against it for that one day; and diverting the occasions,
which that day may tempt you to it; especially often in that day calling to
mind, how you have forborne it: upon committing or rather about to commit it,
forcing your self, and using some bodily gesture, and saying some words of
penitence; (As throwing your self down on your knees; kissing the ground;
smiting your breast; saying some part of the 51 Psalm; or some other pious
Ejaculations, imploring God's help; thinking on Death, Hell, Heaven,) setting
down how many times you commit it etc. for such taking notice of it is the
first step to reformation: Lastly, making more special suit against it in your
prayers.

6. Often discoursing at times, when free from the temptations of it, of the
sinfulness of the vice you are most subject to; and of the excellencies of the
contrary virtue. For such discourse will not only outwardly engage you to
others, but, by little and little, inwardly incline you, to hate and despise
it. When your Soul is more at rest, and the temptations of the sin are not
strong upon you, strongly forcing your self with great courage to exercise some
act of the contary virtue, seeking out (if you meet not with them) some
occasions for this purpose.

. 29.
15. Cherishing all good motions in the Soul etc
1. On the contrary, cherishing and improving (with recogitation upon them) all
good motions that arise in the Soul, as inspirations of the divine Spirit,
(without which we can think no good thing, 2. Cor. 3.5. and therefore all good
thoughts from it; which Spirit the Apostle charge us not to quench, 1. These.
5.19. Not to grieve, Ephesians. 4.30. Now, if from it we derive our good thoughts,
then so often as we repel the one we grieve and quench the other.) Seeking any
outward occasions, that may excite good thoughts. And (when we cannot conquer
our will) praying against our will, that God would make us able to will them.
And this wishing (through the strength that God gives) will at last bring
forth willing. Per id quod homo potest, venit ad id quod vult. In things
Spiritual, doing our endeavor effects our desires: to him, that has, shall be
given, till at length he have abundance.

2. Never neglecting, or refusing, to do, a little Good, as nothing valuable
(though it be but producing in your self, or in another one single good
thought, or wish), there being nothing little in God's service. Nor, to
practice a small mortification as little profiting: nor to forbear a little
ill, as no great hurt.

3. Not suffering any (though inconsiderable) breach to be made upon a good
custom, nor any accrument (as of little consequence) to a bad.

Of the power of Custom.
Digr. Of the great power of Customs. Both (of those of the affections, and
the will) desires, and appetites. And (of the intellect) speculations, and
opinions; inward habits, restlesly, inviting us as much, as outward temptations.

Digr. Of the great power of often remembrance.

4. To introduce virtues, and expel ill habits, practicing first in small
matters rather than higher, unless you perceive God to give great strength,
that you may not in the attempt be presently disheartened.

5. Making have, and being speedy (whilst you are well inclined) in the
execution of things well purposed, and undoubtedly good For none has
continually the like fervor of the Spirit. Si aliquando, cur non modo? Si non
modo; fortasse nunquam.

6. Beginning a good action (when not so well disposed to it) without much
consultation with the Flesh. Quien siempre mira lo postrero, nunca a comete
gran trecho. Et Incipere dat velle; Beginning makes us willing. The
deliberation being as it were occupated by action. Tutta la pena si senti un
poco nel principio. And, Omnia inchoata, tolerabilia, facilia, cito
transeuntia, magnam consolationem relinquentia.

. 30.
16. Subjecting your self to another's conduct.
Subjecting your actions, in all things (not contrary to the law of God; which
things, where is any doubt, you are to learn from your spiritual Superiors) to
the conduct, and guidance, and commands of another. And this according to some
prescriptions of a rule, or otherwise. Or at least subjecting the most
considerable; or those more doubtful. Whose reason, if not of better judgment
(though such you may have, if not faulty in your choice) yet void of passion in
another man's affairs, can better guide you, than your own (some way, or other)
partial affections.

. 31.
17. Restraining your liberty, with Resolutions, and Vows.
1. Restraining hurtful liberty, with resolutions, obligations, vows, to the
forbearance of such a vice, of such a temptation; performance of such a duty,
or counsel, at such hours, on such occasions, etc. For by this we attain to
some resemblance of the good Angels, when binding up our former dangerous
freedom we for the future necessitate our selves to do well. And this
dedicating and consecrating of such our service to God with a Vow, and the
greater firmness and resolution of mind wherewith such duty is performed; the
offering of the tree it self as well as the fruit; the will it self, and the
freedom wherewith God has endowed it, as well as its action: this internal
voluntarily contracted necessity of well doing does, as the Schoolmen observe,
set a much higher value on such action, and render it of a far greater merit
and worth with God. As also the same Vows do more strongly fortify the mind
against future temptations, whilst it suffers not that to re-enter so easily
again into deliberation, which it has already put out of its power; and our
former lusts, or also Satan, despairing as it were now to be heard, makes no
more assaults.

But these Vows or Resolutions at first are to be made only for a short time;
and so that with some tolerable penalty you may redeem your former liberty, by
obliging your self only either to do such an Act, or suffer such a
Mortification. So often fast a meal; say so many Prayers; give so much Alms;
etc. Which Penances if you do indispensably exact of your self when relaxing
good Resolves, you will wonder to see, how small a forfeiture many times
breaks-of the custom of a fault, from which neither Hell could affright, nor
Heaven allure. But at the first take heed of making any absolute and perpetual
engagement for performing things that are of more perfection, least Satan tempt
you beyond your power of resistance, when as you have not as yet gotten a
perfect command over your will, nor sat down first (as our Lord advises you,
Luke 14.28. etc.) to consult your strength whether you have forces enough to
conquer your Enemy, and materials enough to finish your Building; and least you
thus render the doing of that a sin to you, which before was innocent at least;
and, by your soaring higher than your weak wings will yet carry you, you fall
below your former Station, and inherit a Curse from our Lord instead of a
Blessing: Let not thine heart be hasty (says the wiseman, Eccl. 5.2.4, 5.) to
utter any thing before God [ i. e. by way of promise in matters not of
necessary Duty.] For God has no pleasure in fools, and thou must pay that
which thou have vowed: [Therefore] better it is, that thou should not vow,
than that thou should vow and not pay. Which in the first verse he calls a
Sacrifice of Fools. But a Vow releasable, toties, quoties, upon a forfeiture,
especially for new beginners in a course of Piety, cures all this.

. 32.
18. Imposing voluntary Mortifications.
1. Imposing voluntary Mortifications on your self; and that for many ends.

1. For a Sin committed, or Duty omitted.

1. To mind you more of such a sin, and to help to dispose you to that
contrition, and affliction of spirit which is required for it; and which,
whenever it is sincere, and true, does also produce some of these external
penitencies of the Body in some degree.

2. To appease (upon the sight of these humiliations testifying your sorrow)
God's present, or future, wrath toward it; and to divert his eternal
judgments, and prevent also his temporal, many times very heavy ones for
greater sins; and these judgments inflicted on sinners penitent, and already
reconciled. (See 2. Sam. 12.10. Deuteronomy. 3.25, 26. 2. Chron. 16.7, 8, 9. -- 20.37.
-- 35.22, 23. 2. King. 20.17, 18. comp. 2. Chron. 32.31. etc. 1. Cor. 11.30. 2.
Sam. 24.13. 1. King 21.2. 2. Chron. 33.12. Jo. 3.10. comp. 7. 2. Chron. 34.17.
Jer. 26.19.)

3. And to deter your self, by these your sufferings for the past, from
committing the like sin for the future: Thus, not laying hold only on God's
mercy to Sin; but voluntarily siding and taking part with his justice against
it; not wishing, or thinking fit, that so much wickedness should be altogether
gratis, and painless remitted; but (for the honor of the divine justice)
vehemently desiring, and adjudging your self, to undergo some proportion of
sufferings for them.

For bringing your flesh, customarily (severely, and hardly) used to yield more
facile obedience to the Spirit, for the present, or for the future, in things
of duty, and times of need: for he only startles not, when afflictions come,
who does praeoccupare tela fortunae; and whose body suffers from himself what
the world can threaten to it.

3. For obtaining from God the gift of any spiritual Grace, or temporal favor
( Esra. 8.21. Hester. 4.16). For obtaining his resolutions of our
consultations, doubts, etc. For which divine favors, these rigorous
Mortifications excellently prepare us, and are with him most forcible.

For obtaining the pardon of other men's Sins, (to whom we have relation, and of
whose punishments also we may, and are likely to partake,) or relief of their
miseries, ( Psalm. 35.13, 14.) or supply of their necessities.

ways and manners of Mortifications guiding your self rather by the Example of
Holy men (who by the practice thereof have arrived to great Piety and from
Experience recommended them) than by your own Judgment; which experience shows
many things to operate much contrary to our former opination.

Engaging (if need be) to others your performance of these voluntary Penances;
and of your Vows; and paying, to them, your forfeitures, etc.

melting and softening of your heart with sighs, and tears ( Act. 20.19.31.
Phil. 3 18. -- 2. Tim. 1.4.) This is a great benefit that accrews to us from
afflictions, and crosses.

Digr. The benefit of tears upon the Soul; and of not restraining, but
cherishing the effluxes of our Compassion, for our selves, or for others; The
many several kinds of them, all profitable.

. 33.
A Catalogue of several Mortifications.
A Catalogue of several sorts of Mortifications, etc.

Digr. Whereof, in respect of several persons, some have much greater effects
than others, and are also by them more willingly entertained, and therefore it
seems not amiss to hint some variety. Humiliations of the Body, by so many
Meals fasting. Harder clothing, as sackcloth. Lodging, as lying on the
ground, on boards, on ashes, on straw; In their clothes, to be the readier for
rising, and for their Devotions, and to save the time of dressing and
undressing. 2. Sam. 12.16. Going barefoot. 2. Sam. 15.30. None or short
Recreations. Abridging the hours of rest. Sleeping in our clothes, or in a
seat, not bed, to be readier for imposed duties. Punishing the Body with
scourges, weights, hard labors, etc. Denying our selves for a time of what we
find the occasion of a former Sin. Crossing indifferent desires, to learn our
Sense obedience. Enjoining our selves so much solitude and retirement. The
abstaining from such company. Silence for such a time. Such a proportion of
alms. Sending Alms abroad to Religious, to the poor, desiring their prayers for
you in relation to such necessities as press you, Sickness, Persecution, etc.
Reading so many Chapters in the Scriptures, or other pious Books. Meditating so
long on such a subject. Repeating, committing to memory so many Psalms.
Multiplying extraordinary hours of Prayer. Visiting some loathed objects of
mortality or pity. Confessing our fault to another every time we commit it
etc. Many of which, and many more may be largely exemplified in the practices
of our Lord Himself.

. 34.
19. Confessing frequently your sins to your spiritual Guide.
1. Confessing very frequently all your sins to your spiritual Father and
Director; to receive his ministerial Absolution from them upon judgment of your
penitence; his Sacerdotal Benediction; and prescription of such Humiliations,
and Penances, as may be thought further necessary for the appeasing of God's
wrath toward them, and your present cure from them: to receive his spiritual
advice and Consolations; his Prayers, and Intercessions to God for you; to put
your self to the oftener shame, and the taking revenge on your self for them;
to glorify the justice of God's judgments, (if then you lie under any) and to
avert them. For Confession of sin is a special means to the sick, or otherwise
afflicted, for their recovery, and deliverance out of their distress; Jam.
5.14, 15, 16. The resolution of such frequent confessing keeps a modest man in
awe from sinning; the preparing for Confession helps him better to know his
Sins; the testifying to another of his sorrow for them, binds him more to
forsake them; and God's grace and illumination accompanies such Humiliation.

2. Your Confession (to reap the more benefit therefrom) to be always very
particular, that by the more exact knowledge of the state of your conscience
(both concerning the several facts, and especially concerning the motives to,
and the continuance of, them) your spiritual Physician may apply more proper
remedies to your disease.

3. Uncovering your sins (especially your greater sins and those that more
afflict your conscience) to other your confidents; and, amongst them, to those
rather by whom you are esteemed, and who are more eminent than you in Piety,
for your greater Mortification. And very beneficial it is to do the same, upon
the rising of any temptation: for this much confounds your spiritual adversary
that suggests them, to see himself ministerial to your virtues, instead of
faults.

4. Ordering, with some others daily conversation with you, a mutual,
conscientious, and free, admonition of your faults; Even the wisest, and
holiest of men, being not, so well as others much inferior, able to discern
some of their imperfections

. 35.
20. Openly professing a zeal of Piety and Christian Virtues.
1. Making open profession of your extraordinary desire and affection to
Devotion and Piety. Forbearing no holy Action, because to be done openly and in
public; and resolved for this willingly to undergo the imputation (as it must
be at first) of Hypocrisy, or Vainglory. Remembering Ecclesiasticus 20.22.
There is, that destroys his own Soul through bashfulness; and by accepting of
persons overthrows himself. By this course you shall never afterward be
ashamed of your duty, when it happens to be contrary to fashion, having, once
for all, pre-occupated this shame in your former Profession. By this, you shall
stand at all times engaged to make good what you so openly pretend. By this,
others, as knowing your resolution, will cease to tempt or seduce you from it;
and will abandon you to your better inclinations.

2. Contemning utterly, and scorning, worldly Reputation and Disgrace; the
pleasing or the offending of men; which are the greatest enemies of Piety.

3. Contemning (in the exercise of Religious Duties) scandals, and offenses,
unjustly taken at you.

. 36.
21. Strongly apprehending God's presence.
n. 1.
Strongly imagining (or rather apprehending what is a truth) the presence of
God (as also of his Holy Angels standing always by you) in the place where you
are,
and looking into your deeds, words, and thoughts, and much rejoicing in your
Virtues. This Imagination (through God's Grace) is easily attained, by accustoming
your fancy awhile thereto, and will much enliven your prayers and discourses
with God; and sanctify and solace your Solitudes, etc. But, without often
weighing, and pondering, this presence, your general knowledge (thus
unapplied), that God is present in all things, will not benefit you so much.
See larger Directions concerning this below,. 94.

. 36. n. 2.
22. Contemplating his Omni-Agency.
Considering God's Omni-agency; and that nothing small, or great, in this world
happens to us by chance: but that God's Creatures only perform and execute what
his hand, and his counsel determined before to be done: i, e. that nothing here
is done, without the Divine knowledge, permission, and providence directing it
to the Divine, i. e. to some good, or also the very best End. The Benefits of
which Meditation are always exceeding great. For who strongly believes and
remembers this, conforms himself peaceably to all events as to God's Will; and
is contented with whatever happens, as knowing this Divine Will to be steered
also with infinite Wisdom. Therefore as he is diligent in his labors,
directed to many particular good ends, so he trusts not in these to effect such
ends, but looks more at the motions of the Divine Will and Cooperation; and so
soon as ever this, by the event, discovers it self to him, whether it
dis-appoint, or prosper, his works (and those ordered in the best manner he
could for God's Service,) He sides with this Divine Will, it being as the main
end his actions aimed at. And thus he is never defeated in his purpose. Is
ready to praise God on all occasions, whether seeming (as to particular ends)
good, or bad; as knowing indeed all best that God does. Entertains with
chearfulnes and resignation to this Superior Power all cross accidents; gives
God particular thanks for every thing that falls out well: suffers none of
God's excellent works to be lost, and passed by unregarded; but observes them,
speaks of them, acknowledges them for his, and gives him Glory: and admires
and commends no persons else for any good, but only as his Instruments, and
with an eyeing of him as the chief Principle thereof: Is displeased with the
actions of none of God's Creatures, in order to himself; and especially, not
with those of his enemies; cannot think ill of them for this, but always
excuses and pardons them, as looking beyond and above them at the Divine
Providence, which by them exercises a necessary trial of his patience, and
other Christian Virtues. Finally in all things that befall him, he sees as it
were God's Will writ upon them: and so, out of the love of God, admits them
into his affections, saying continually in his heart: Domine fiat voluntas tua.
-- Pater mi, non sicut ego volo, sed sicut Tu. And so continues always in
repose; is seldom or never much angry or discontented. And by this way
exceedingly pleases God, for he is always undissemblingly commending whatever
He does.

PART III. DUTIES.
. 37.
AFter these Considerations, and Counsels, the two first parts, chiefly
directing to the cure and preventing of Sin, our negative Holiness in eschewing
evil; follows the Third; Viz. The positive Sanctity that God our Creator
requires of, and in, us; consisting in the Practice of all Holy Duties and
Christian Virtues. Of these, First, In diligently doing all good we can.
Secondly, In patiently suffering all evil; together with the means to procure
and preserve these Virtues.

For the former, The practicing all Holy Duties, and doing Good; The Duties
required of a Christian are threefold. 1. Toward your self, Duties Moral. 2.
Toward your Neighbor, Civil. 3. Toward God, Religious. Living, 1. Soberly,
2. Righteously, 3. Holily: The three grand Duties mentioned in our Lord's
Sermon, 1. Fasting, Matt. 6.16. -- 2. Alms, -- 6.1. -- 3. Prayer, -- 6.5. In
the prosecution of which, so far as the former Counsels are subservient to the
promoting of them, I shall refer you to them, and forbear here a repetition.

. 38.
1. To your Self.
1. Then, The Duties I have chosen more specially to recommend to you
concerning your self, and which may prepare you for the Duty you are charged
with to your Neighbor, and Service you owe unto God (For the third depends on
the second: He that loves not his Brother, how can he love God? 1. Jo. 4.20.
And the second again depends on the first; whilst your Neighbor is to be loved
only as your self. Matt. 22.39.) are these.

1. The purity and sanctification of Body, By

. 39.
1. Temperance and Sobriety, in Food; in Apparel; Lodging; modest Deportment;
etc.

For the better attaining of some perfection in which Virtue, I must refer you
to review the former Counsels, concerning diet, sleep, recreation, sensual
pleasures, the avoiding usual and former occasions of sinning, in.
17.20.21.22.26.

Digr. 1. Of the great influence the several treatment of the Body has upon
the Soul, and all its actions. Therefore much care to be spent upon a right
government of It by him who aspires to any Holiness or Virtue.

Digr. 2. Of the Vices opposite.

. 40.
n. 1.
2. Chastity; where I remit you to what has been said before of the Gift of
Continency,. 17. n. 4.

Digr. 1. Of its Contraries, Adultery, Fornication, Selfpollution and
Uncleanness, unlawful and unnatural Lusts.

. 40. n. 2.
Of which it may be observed; That with no other Passion men are so strongly
assaulted as with lusts and sensual loves; Therefore, Hos. 4.11. It is said to
take away the heart: No Passion, that so much increases the desire of it the
more we descend to a particular cogitation, and discussion of it: So that it is
not to be conquered by wrestling with it, but by running away from it: None
that in its acts so captivates and incarnates the Soul, and restrains its
liberty of reasoning or thinking of any thing else. Therefore God in pity to
man has provided him a lawful remedy thereof by Marriage: But yet still left
him under under great restraints, confining him to one single person; and most
severely prohibiting the satiating thereof in any other way, either with any
other person, or by himself. And such sins (great varieties of which are left
in man's power) we find above most other faults exceedingly aggravated, both
for the great offense they give to God's own Holiness and Purity; and for the
great dishonor and defilement they bring to the bodies of such persons, whom
he first created after his own Image, and since has made Members of the Body
of Christ, and Temples of the Holy Ghost; and from the beginning has cast a
natural shame and modesty upon him, as to the committing of these more than of
any other, Crimes. And such carnal sins we also find, beyond almost any other,
pursued with most severe judgments. For all which I must recommend these Texts
and Passages of Holy Scripture to your serious meditation.

. 40. n. 3.
1. That amongst the works of the Flesh these sins of Uncleanness are usually
set in the Front. See Gal. 5.19. The works of the flesh are manifest which are
these; Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanness, Lasciviousness, etc. Again, Col.
3.5. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; that is,
Fornication, Uncleanness, inordinate Affection, evil Concupiscence, etc. After
which in the second place, Verse. 8. follow, Anger, wrath, malice, evil speaking
or blaspemy. Again, 1. Cor. 6.9. Be not deceived: neither Fornicators, nor
Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with
mankind etc, shall inherit the kingdom of God. Romans 1.29. Being filled with
all unrighteousness; Fornication, etc; See the like 1. Cor. 5.10, 11. -- 1.
Pet. 4.3. -- 2. Pet. 2.10. Still you see these sins as the greatest darlings of
the flesh lead the whole band. And these sins of Lust are they, with which the
Gentiles every where stand principally charged before the Light of the Gospel
shone amongst them. See Romans 1.25, 26, 27. 1 Thessalonians. 4, 5. Ephesians. 4.19; and which
are ordinarily linked together with that of Idolatry. See 1. Cor. 5.10, 11. --
6, 9. Rev. 22.15. (being a usual companion of their Idol-feasts) or with (...);
whether this be taken for the coveting of persons as some understand it, or of
riches, which is said to be Idolatry too, Ephesians. 5.3.5. Col. 3.5. These two,
Harlots and Money, being the two great Idols in this lower world; the one or
the other of which steal away men's hearts.

. 40. n. 4.
2. That in these Scriptures (See 1 Thessalonians. 4.3.7, 8. And 1. Cor. 6. from the
13. verse to the end) These Vices of Carnal Lusts are aggravated as peculiarly
opposite to a certain Holiness which ought to be in the Body as well as in the
Soul of all those who profess themselves Members of Christ, or Members of that
chaste Virgin (as the Apostle calls her 2. Cor. 11.2.) his Spouse the Church;
whom he bought and purchased to himself with his own blood and life; and whom
he cherishes as the same flesh and bone ( Ephesians. 5.29, 30. etc.) and as the same
Spirit (1. Cor. 6.17.) with himself; and for whom now is our Body as well as
the Soul; and the Lord for it (1. Cor. 6.13.) Therefore is this Holiness of the
Body, both conjugal and virginal, as well as of the Spirit, often mentioned by
the Apostle 1 Thessalonians. 4.4. This is the Will of God (says he) your
Sanctisication, that ye should abstain from Fornication, that every one of you
should know how to possess his vessel [ i. e. his Body, See 1. Sam. 21.5.] in
sanctification and honor; not in Lusts of Concupiscence. For (ver. 8.) God
has called us not to Uncleanness, but unto Holiness. And 1. Cor. 6.20.
compared with Ephesians. 5.29. etc. to the end. Ye are bought with a price [to be the
Spouse of our Lord] therefore glorify God in your Body, and in your Spirit,
which are God's. [his Members now, not yours; according to 1. Cor. 7.4. The
wife has not power of her own Body [No more then has Christ's Wife or Spouse]
but the husband. Ibid. verse. 34. The Virgin (says he) cares for the things of
the Lord [how she may please him] that she may be holy both in Body and Spirit
[which is a transcendent Holiness of the Body beyond the Conjugal]. And 2. Cor.
7.1. (after the Apostle had spoken of their being God's Temples in the 6th
Chapter), Wherefore (says he) let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of
the Flesh and of the Spirit, [so] perfecting Holiness. And more expressly: Flee
Fornication (says he) 1. Cor. 6.18. [Why?] For every [other] sin that a man
does is without the Body [ i. e. without any proper infamy to the Body, or
giving the power and honor thereof to another besides our Lord Christ] but he
that commits Fornication sins against his own Body [ i. e. in degrading
it to so base an alliance as to become the same with that vile creature with
which it sinneth]. Therefore, Ephesians. 5.3, 4. the Apostle also peculiarly
concerning this sin or any filthy discourse tending to it, gives charge that
it should not be once named among such as will go for Saints. But Fornication
(says he) and all Uncleanness or Coveteousness let it not be once named among
you as becomes Saints; Nor filthiness or foolish talking which are not
convenient [or which greatly mis-become such as you; see the same phrase, Romans
1.28]. And as God cast a special shame upon man in the committing of this Sin;
so, in receiving him again after his fall into a new covenant of his Grace,
made with Abraham the Father of the faithful, he caused the Seal thereof to be
set particularly on those parts, in a circumcision of them, which were the
instruments of Lust. In Romans 1.26. etc. We find God to abandon those, who had
otherwise much displeased him in their following Idols etc, whenas God has
left such manifest testimonies in all his creatures of himself, were to the
greatest disgrace and dishonor of humane nature that could be; called there
(...). And in Apocal. 22.15. The Practisers of one Species thereof (as if it
did utterly depose us from our manhood) are called by the name of Dogs (which
see also in Deuteronomy. 23.18. and Phil. 3.2. for the Gnostics stood guilty of such
impurities). And, Job. 36.14. This is pronounced as a Curse upon a Hypocrite;
that Vita eorum is inter effeminatos.

. 40. n. 5.
3. The wrath also of God toward those Sins above others appears every where
in these holy Writings most evident; by whose revenge we may most rightly
measure the greatness of these faults, by many made so natural and excusable.
In 1 Thessalonians. 4.6. the Apostle warns the Thessalonians to abstain from the
Fornication of the Gentiles, Because the Lord (says he) is the avenger of all
such: And, Heb. 13.4. Marriage is honorable and the Bed undefiled: But
Whore-mongers and Adulterers God will judge. And in detestation of such
unlawful Lusts, the Lord appointed Deuteronomy. 23.2. That a Bastard should not enter
into the Congregation of the Lord until his tenth Generation.

And for these sins it was, that God in the sacred Story inflicted those
fearful Judgments to which none other can be compared. For these, that he
drowned the world, and washed away its pollution with the Flood, Genesis 6.1, 2.
For these, that he rained flaming Brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrah, and
purified their Land with Fire. For these, that all those mighty Nations were
destroyed out of Canaan, and their Land given to the Children of Israel, See
Levit. Chap. 18. Where, after great variety of these sins rehearsed, it
follows, Verse. 27. For all these abominations (for this name God gives to these
Sins for their loathsomness) have the men of the Land done that were before
you, and the Land is defiled; and therefore, in the Verse following, this
defiled Land is said to have spued out the inhabitants thereof. For such Sin,
that Twenty three Thousand of the Children of Israel also fell in one day at
Baal-peor before they entered Canaan. See 1. Cor. 10.8. For such Sin, that all
the Tribe of Benjamin was cut off, except only Six hundred men, Judge. 20. I
need not mention the Wars and Slaughter that followed upon David's Adultery;
and the ten Tribes rent from Solomon as a Judgment upon his being seduced to
the Toleration of Idolatry by his Lusts and unlawful Marriages. This is enough
to show that these Sins, tho seeming most excusable and natural to Man, are
most abominable and loathsome to God; especially since the new Contract that is
made between Us and our Lord; and since our Bodies are become the Temples of
the Holy Ghost; Which Temples (1. Cor. 3.17. says the Apostle) Whosoever defiles,
him will God destroy.

. 41.
3. Humility
2. The Purity and Sanctification of the Soul, By

3. Humility, [(...)], and Mortification of your Reason; opposite to all
self-conceit of your own perfections; (and especially that of your Holiness,
and Mortifications;) pride; hypocrisy; ambition; envy; wrath; contentions of
Argument; disobedience to Superiors; curiosity of Science; Schism; Heresy; and
what other Vices proceed from high-mindedness.

. 42.
Of its Opposites.

1. Rational; Pride of Wit, and Judgment. 2. Spiritual; Pride of Purity and
Holiness. 3. Anger against Vice: aggravating of other men's faults, when as
Charity covers them (1. Pet. 4.8.) and bears, and hops, all things 1.
Cor. 13.7. and considers her self, lest she also be so tempted, Gal. 6.1. 4.
Anger against Error; and contending vehemently (to convince those that oppose
us) for truth; when as the wrath of man, etc. Jam. 1.20. And the wisdom from
above is gentle, etc. Jam. 3.17. And the man of God should not strive, 2. Tim.
2.24. And God only in his good time may reveal, and convince, but ordinarily we
cannot. Phil. 3.15. 2. Tim. 2.25. To prevent which anger, not easily engaging
your self in every discourse; nor (engaged) contradicting Him, with whom you
contest, in every thing that he says amiss; but only for a very necessary
Truth: nor seeking any way to exasperate his Spirit; or to provoke him to speak
something against his conscience; or to disparage, and shame, him.
. 43.
The means to attain and preserve such Humility; and avoid such Pride.
1. Often comparing yours, with the recorded lives of former Saints, or of some
persons living, who are very eminent in holiness; but carefully avoiding any
comparison with others, inferior.

2. Often considering, 1 the great imperfection of your holy duties: 2 and the
good in such imperfection proceeding totally from God; we being rather moved;
than moving, as to it.

3. Never judging your self by the good opinion others have of you; to whom we
naturally hide our weaknesses and faults, show our perfections, and virtues.

4. Often meditating on any singular deformities or infirmities in your body,
or imbecility of any faculty of your soul, fancy, memory, elocution, etc; of
any great sins, or disgraces of yours, past, or present; or considering, what a
one, you use to be, in the times of desolation, and the withdrawings of God's
Spirit.

5. Often comparing your sins with theirs, who, without like mercy showed, or
means for their salvation offered (as you have had,) suffer, some of them
temporal; some, eternal, vengeance; particularly, with the one only fault of
the lost Angels; or the first sin of Adam; so severely vindicated.

6. On the contrary hiding from your self (as much as you can) other men's
Infirmities (the sight of which is the chief ground of self-conceit;) and
looking upon their perfections (there being none but (by God's all wise
distribution of his gifts) have something, or other, wherein he has advantage
of us) that so you may fulfill the Apostle's Rule ( Phil. 2. chapter 3. ver.) in
esteeming others better than your self.

7. Not concealing your defects and faults from others.

8. Suffering defamations of your innocence, or the gainsaying of truths (which
are not of much moment) without much vindicating them; other men's opinion of us
(from which we take the chief estimate of our selves) when ill humbling us
much; and this unsollicitousness of our credit saving much contention.

9. On the contrary concealing your good things; not desiring to appear wise,
or learned, or holy, and favored of God; not speaking truths (but upon great
necessity) which any way tend to your reputation. Not making much appearance,
and outward demonstrations, and professions of Humility; which (when true)
affects to hide her self, as well as to hide other virtues. Not doing any thing
to gain applause; considering, that who have their reward here, shall not have
one, or shall have it less, hereafter; and that God many times humbles, as
things that magnify themselves, so things magnified of others.

. 44.
4 Right ordering of out judgment.
4. Prudence, and a sober and right ordering of your Judgment.

1. Right ordering of the judgment concerning Good and Evil.
1. A right ordering of it concerning Good and Evil.

1. Since many sins proceed, after the rectifying in some measure of
affections, from misperswasions of judgment, therefore entertaining a Christian
jealousy over your Reason, and the suggestions of lying Spirits counterfeiting
the Divine; lest, intending what is good, or taking the liberty of what you
think indifferent, you do, instead of it, what is evil. See Jam. 1.26. Luke
18.11. See Numb. 8.

Digr. 1. Of the several kinds of the false species of Virtues, vulgarly
mistaken.

Digr. 2. Of the great danger of following your conscience, misinformed. And
of the guilt of vicious, or faultily-contracted ignorance, by how much any sin
is lightened for being done out of ignorance, by so much the sin of ignorance
being aggravated, because contracted by your default: Sins of ignorance, being
also many times the punishments (when a wicked heart is also justly darkened) of
former sins of malice. Luke 23.34. Act. 3.17. Jo. 5.45. Matt. 25.44.

2. Taking heed of false Humilities; As first, Of not having confidence in God
concerning any affair; to show your humility, that either man in general ought
not to expect such a particular divine providence over him; or that you in
particular are not worthy of such a favor. Secondly, Of not attempting any
extraordinary course of Piety; lest you should seem ambitious of a greater
degree of sanctity than befits your calling, or the gifts which God has given
you; or, as excusing your self therefrom by some natural infirmities; and not
rather considering, that such a resolute course (though more imperfect)
through, and notwithstanding these impediments, is to God far more acceptable,
and of greater price, and reward: Or, lest you should seem ambitious of
extolling your self above others, accounted Holy; or should seem by your
practice to contemn, or condemn, theirs; or to turn the free Grace of God (who
can make you better, when he pleases) into humane industry; or to undertake to
merit your reward, or satisfy for your sins. Or, not daring to be much good,
lest you should be proud; when, as true Sanctity grows greater, so humility;
and such person still more discerns, that the good he does or evil he
forbears is by God's special Grace and not his endeavors (tho also not without
them) this happening many times how or when he imagines not such an effect: See
how God's Grace wrought on St. Paul, 1. Cor. 15.9. Ephesians. 3.8. -- 1. Tim.
1.13.15. -- 1. Cor. 2.3. Or lest you should fall into some great temptations,
or melancholies, as some others have done; or should not be able to persevere
etc. When as all the way, except the beginnings only, is full of pleasure; And
God certainly gives (in all things of his service) ability to perform, what we
have the courage to attempt: dat velle, dabit and perficere: mal delibera, chi
troppo teme. Thirdly, Of omitting Piety in public; lest you should seem
vainglorious, etc. Fourthly, Of omitting your devotions at any time, because,
being distracted with business, company, or in an ill humor, you cannot offer
them up with the reverence due to them; when as a weak performance is always
more acceptable, than an absolute omission; and doing of the thing excites the
mind; and, where it finds not an inclination, by degrees effects it.

3. Taking heed of dissembling to your self (out of a pretense of more
humility) and not taking strict notice of any gifts, graces, illuminations, or
holy inclinations, God bestows upon you (where you must needs, be either
ungrateful, or acknowledge you are favored). For this acknowledgment of them
(contrary-wise) will both (in weighing the disproportion of these graces to
your ill deserts) produce in you the most profound humiliations ( Who am I O
Lord God, 1. Chron. 17.16. Depart from me, Luke 5.8. I am not worthy, Genesis
32.10. My Family is poor; and I the least in my Father's house, Judge. 6.15. I
have sinned, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son; make me as one of
thine hired Servants, Luke 15.21.19.) and indignation for your neglect and
abuse of them, and so ill a requital; And also put you continually in mind of
the extraordinary service required from you, proportionable to them; and make
you undertake greater matters, by seeing how far his goodness has enabled you;
For, how shall he spend so freely, who knows not that he is rich?

4. Taking heed of too much scrupulousness, and fear, of surreptitious
temptations, so long, as they are abhorred: which sometimes cannot be avoided;
and are by Satan, when conscience begins to grow tender, often raised in us. To
cure which, is to slight them; or, they growing stronger, to declare, and
confess, them.

5. Taking heed of the errors of judgment in the choice, and practice, of
virtues. Not choosing those most, that are more pleasant to sense, and less
troublesome to the flesh. As, devotions, rather than labors. See Jer. 7.22.
Esa. 58.3. (or the contrary sometimes as the person is disposed) works of
charity, rather than temperance, and mortifications of the flesh: but rather
choosing those still, to which the flesh is more averse, and which seem to you
more difficult, penal, chargable: as acts of humiliation; abstinence; silence;
solitude; liberal Alms, etc. (For the sense, and flesh, are mostwhat seducers);
That obedience being far more acceptable, wherein we do, for God's sake,
things, to which we are neither affectioned, nor yet indifferent; but which are
things expensive; or things painful; amongst which the most precious in God's
sight are alms, and sufferings. And if, in all things deliberated on (which of
them you should do) the same rule be observed you shall seldom err; (whilst
that, which is only by the inclinations of sense to it commended, and made
equiballancing to the other, ought to be counted always of it self too light)
and at length procure a perfect mortification both of your lusts, and will

6. Not relying wholly on the practice of the exterior acts; and that of some
virtues, that are more plausible to the world, in which there may be some
secret ingredient of vain glory, and to be seen of men. Nor looking more
diligently to your words, and actions, (which may partly come from some awe,
and reverence to your company, your profession, or fame, etc.) whilst you give
more liberty to your thoughts, which defile the soul. But taking more special
care of doing your duty, in those acts thereof, which are contrary to your
reputation; some acts of the same virtue being honorable, others disgraceful:
As, in charity, honorable to give an alms, but to put up an injury, base.

7. Not practicing them partially; much addicted to some, wholly neglecting
others, (The Pharisees, not others-but self-deceiving, hypocrysy, Luke 18.11.):
As, to be so great a servant to several works of charity to your neighbor, as,
not to borrow any time, from these, for your own (more necessary) Devotions, or
for the service of God; Again, so constant at your devotions, as to neglect
your vocation, and the duties you owe to your Family or the Commonwealth. But
striving (as far as possible) to be eminent in many things: setting before you
the lives of the Saints.

8. Nor yet despising others, who practice not the same things with you, tho
they be perchance, in some other more worthy Grace, far more eminent, as the
Publican was, than the Pharisee ( paying so much tithe, and eating so little,
etc.) in humility.

Digr. Of our Hypocrisies unknown to us; and wherein not others but our selves
are deceived. As other Hypocrisies are so called because we are not what we
seem to others; so this, because we are not what we seem to our selves. The
others estate may be more sinful, but this more incurable. See Examples of
such, Luke 18.9.11. Matt. 15.14. -- 7.3. Jo. 9.41. Apoc. 3.1.17. Prove. 14.12.
-- 30.12.

9. Not being so ambitious to do some great good, as to neglect a little;
aspiring to do some good you cannot, and neglecting the good you can, do. Very
valiant about things future, and vanquished by things present. Earnest to do
some great services to God, but such still as are out of our reach; and
meanwhile omitting those, which are offered to, and ready for, us. Whereas
desiring to perform all good, according to what present talent you have, is the
direct way to have what you farther desire; and he that is not faithful (first)
in a little, shall never be trusted with much, Luke 16.10, 11, 12. -- 1. Cor.
7.24.27.

10. Being very studious of, and circumspectly practicing, those virtues, whose
use is more common, and general; and therefore they are less admired, or
regarded in our practice: as, mildness; humble behavior; contentedness;
smaller temperances; and charities and offices of Love; admonitions; silence,
and modesty; diligence in business; exact fidelity; Christian simplicity;
entire patience in petty injuries, in lesser pains, in smaller losses:
dedicating to God's service, and resigning to his good pleasure, your smallest
actions (1. Cor. 10.31.) In the smallest matters not giving scandal etc,
because the occasions of such virtues often return; and the greater number of
these equals the greater magnitude of some others in acquiring of heaven.

11. Not, for doing what may seem a greater good, that is impertinent to you,
neglecting a lesser your duty: As a Clergyman following lay-business. The
Apostles serving Tables. Our Savior dividing land; doing rather what is
conformable to your Calling, than agreeable to your Will.

12. Not prosecuting what you conceive good, or avoiding what is evil, with too
much passion. All vehement desires (tho seeming good), that discompose the
mind, and breed inquietude, hastiness, and discontent, are temptations, and
much hinder the judgment in the prudence it should use in the prosecution of
its work. Action therefore is to be deferred till these heats are a little
overpast. He that (though in good things) is governed by his passions is
subject to many errors. Using therefore ordinarily, in good designs also, a
suppression of the excess of your affections. As, not rebuking your self, or
others too angrily for a fault: Not being too angry against your self for being
angry: Least, from this indulgence your passions sometimes debord where you
would not have them; and lest from this custom, where they are more innocent,
you use the same, when faulty.

13. Never doing the least evil (that appears so) that good may come of it; for
more evil, than good, comes to us of every evil; not omitting any good of
obligation, lest evil should come of it.

14. In all things avoiding extremes: neither affirming, nor denying; neither
commending, nor condemning, all: Nor always at your Devotions; nor always at
your Works.

15. Toward all worldly things trespassing rather in the defect, than in the
excess; the contrary, in spiritual, and divine.

16. In all those actions, which cannot utterly be forborne, and quitted, and
yet an excess in them is a sin, and the same action, that is now lawful, if
continued, presently becomes unlawful (As, Eating, going-on to intemperance;
providing for your self, or family, into covetousness; particular affection,
into concupiscence; recreations, into voluptuosity, etc.) Keeping ever a more
strict watch over your self; leaning rather to the defects, and never wholly
justifying your self in using them, where it is so easy to transgress.

17. Not judging of your spiritual condition, your religion etc, by your
coolness, or fervency, in Devotion; by God's ways toward you of mercy, or
judgments, prosperity or afflictions; (the Book of Job was written to undeceive
us in this) by your former sins; by quietness of conscience (which is many
times caused by a faulty ignorance): but only by the fruits of godliness; and
that, not some partial holiness, in some one, or few duties, but universal,
sincere, constant; nor yet in freedom from the acts of any vice, when no
occasions offered; but in conquering these, when tempted.

Digr. Of a certain quietness of conscience, common to the Orthodox, and
erroneous, to good men, and bad: (so far as they are either ignorant, or
forgetful, and not considering:) and so undoing most men; who, instead of
laboring (out of a pious fear) a reform or better information of their
conscience, judge only of their condition by its present persuasions, and
presume of safety in not going against it. This of a right ordering of our
Judgment as to Good and Evil.

. 45.
2. Right ordering of the Judgment concerning Truth, and Error
2. A right ordering of our Judgment, concerning Truth and Error.

1. Judging of the truth of Doctrines, as you see they tend to godliness (1.
Tim. 6.3. Tit. 1.1.) and as they are more fitted for bringing forth in us the
fruits of good works. For, by their fruits are true, and false, doctrines
certainly known. Matt. 7.16.20. holiness, and truth, vice, and error, being
consectaries one of another.

. 46.
2. Taking heed of those doctrines, which weaken the practice of Piety, etc.
(To name you some of them) such as these seem to be.

If any -- Should teach you, That to abstain from any thing, which it is lawful
by God's word to enjoy, is fruitless; will worship; Superstition.

-- Should assure you of an equal facility of attaining heaven in all
conditions of life; not noting to you the great lets, and temptations, that are
in some, beyond others: (as in honors, riches, marriage, etc.) to excite your
choice of the Better; or your vigilance in the other.

-- Should disallow, or discourage, Vows; and other prefortifications against
those things which have been former occasions of sinning: and the abstaining
where-from is in our Power.

-- Should speak against frequent hours of prayer in the day; frequent days of
solemn worship in the year; frequent celebrations of the Eucharist; frequent
Confession, and Communion; frequent fasting days, and macerations of the Body,
etc.

-- Should remit unto you the reins of your obedience to the authority of the
Church; requiring it only to her, when she commands that, which you, in your
own judgment, weighing her reasons, do think just and right to be believed, or
practiced.

-- Should disallow confession of your sins to the Priest.

-- Should affirm, that confession to God, or the Priest, is sufficient for
remission of Sin, without reformation of life and quitting Sin.

-- Or, that an internal sorrow of the Soul for them is only required; and any
further external, and corporal penances, humiliations, or punishing your self
for them useless.

-- Or teach, that these penances and mortifications are necessary only (when
they are imposed) to satisfy the scandal given the Church; but no way, to
appease the wrath of God.

-- Or, that your sins are remitted by money, alms, Ecclesiastical indulgences,
or Absolutions, when these are not preceded by a true Contrition.

-- Should teach you, that all sins (without any distinction amongst them) are
equally effecting your damnation; and either that All, or that None, put you
out of the Grace and favor of God; and that several degrees of Penitence are
not necessary, according to the quality of your offense.

-- Should teach you, that good works are not necessary to Salvation; and that
the promises of reward are made only to faith. -- or, necessary, not from a
strict obligation of every regenerate man to do them, having time for it; but
only, out of gratitude -- or, as fruits, that necessarily spring out of a true
faith.

-- Should so extol Faith in our Savior's merits (i.e.) in his good works, as,
to make supervacuous inherent Righteousness. Or faith in our Savior's
satisfaction (i.e.) in his sufferings, as to void all our self-afflictions,
mortifications, and conformity unto his death.

-- Should teach your inability (though in the state of Grace) to observe all
God's Commandments; and to please him in your works, and to fulfill his law; as
to the forbearance of all greater sins, and offenses, against any part thereof.

-- Should hold no degrees of perfection in our obedience; nor any latitude of
goodness, above that, of not being in fault; making none better than him that
only keeps from sinning; or him, whoever is not the most good, to be amongst
offenders; and one falling short of the highest degree of any virtue (as of
Prayer, Charity, etc.) in this to be guilty of sin; to the taking away of all
confidence in God for any good or acceptable work done by us; and emulation of
being perfect; and pre-eminence of those who are Saints.

-- Should teach, the heavenly reward to be to all persons equal; so that, who
is more holy than the rest that enter-in thither (Suppose St. Paul, than the
Publican) does, in the overplus of his mortifications etc, serve God for naught.

-- Should extol Predestination, Election, Grace, certainty of Salvation, etc.
(i. e.) the mercies of God, so far, as to remit, and discourage, all Man's
endeavors.

-- Should deny the continuance of God's miraculous works (now, as they have
been in former times) to Holy men's Prayers; (to the great weakening, of Prayer,
and Faith) and of the making use of the intercessions of Saints, and of holy
men for us.

-- Should labor more to instruct you, in what sense, and [quatenus] such and
such Christian virtues, are not to be practiced, than in what, they are;
whereby you become more inclined to the omission, than inflamed to the
practice; of them. As, That Confession of sins to the Priest is not to be used,
if not necessary jure divino; or because all our sins cannot be recounted or
remembered: Not alms, not penances; that is, as self-sufficient satisfactions
to God's justice for your sins. Not good works; that is, as thinking to merit
heaven by them abstracting from our Lord's. Not set times of Prayer, of
Fasting, etc; that is, as of divine command, or essential parts of God's
Worship. No Addresses to Saints, or Holy-men of God for their Prayers and
Intercessions to God for us lawful; i. e. with such a belief and intention as
if the Divine Majesty did not immediately hear or receive our own Prayers: or,
as if our Lord's Intercessions and Mediation for us were defective or
unsufficient without them. Should teach you, that voluntary poverty, or selling
our Goods to give them to the Poor; Celibacy; preaching without charges;
remitting just Lawsuits; and not requiring (by constraint) satisfaction for
damages; not wearing of gold, costly apparel, etc. 1. Pet. 3.3. are no general
Advices and Counsels to all (save only in preparatione animi, to do them in
some time of great exigence; as in persecution, etc.); but are particular
precepts (and so obligatory) to some only, we know not whom; in some particular
cases, we know not when. I say, Taking heed, and having great jealousy of the
truth of such doctrines, which, you experimentally find, do weaken the practice
of Piety; as several of these doctrines forementioned seem to do.

. 47.
3. Considering, Doctors, Religions, Sects, according to the less, or more
liberty, or severity of their doctrines; remissness, or strictness of their
discipline; the more, or less, practice of mortifications and devotions, in
them; (for the severest Religion is the best; and the most Spiritual
consolations, and the surest way of Salvation are in it:) According to their
erring more in speculative points; or more in practicals; for the Error in
practicals is much more dangerous; Since a small measure of knowledge is
exacted of Christians, but much of duty. Again; According to the more works,
and Monuments of Piety and Charity, which you find to abound in either; For
there surely is the greatest love of God; and love is never without light.
Lastly, According to the greater or less value it sets upon the Fathers,
Councils, and her own authority. For those, whose doctrines more agree to those
of the Fathers and Councils seem rather to be adhered-to, and those more
agreeing with them are likely more to value, and ascribe to them an higher
authority: and also who lessen Church Authority seem to have the less Title to
it; And she who more earnestly challenges a filial obedience, seems stronglier
to believe her self the true Mother. On the contrary, Step-mothers, and the
little-favoured by former Authority and Antiquity endeavor more according to
their interest to prejudice, weaken, and depress all these; do much insist upon
Christian liberty and quote frequently the texts that may seem to caution
against any such rash submission to or dependence on others (as Matt. 15.9.14.
-- 1. Jo. 4.1. 1 Thessalonians. 5.21.) And to render their Sons full of unsettledness,
unconstancy, and dispute.

. 48.
4. Avoiding curiosities of Science, and the inquiring into, and dispute about
the (...), Quomodo and Quatenus of things. ((...) says Gregory Nazianzen) For,
besides that of such silly languishing (of one not content with sound words, 1.
Tim. 6.4. comp. 3.) about many questions, and (...) (as they are called by the
Apostle) do come envies, contentions, railings, and evil surmisings, and
perverse disputings, and mis-interpretations of other men's meanings (1. Tim.
6.4.) It also happens many times, that from an only-excluded- quatenus in the
dispute, the whole substance of a necessary duty is prejudiced and omitted in
men's practice.

. 49.
5. In these matters of Controversy more willingly embracing those tenants,
that give more, than that give less, efficacy to any Christian practice, or
duty. Since the one increases, the other diminishes, your affection to it,
and the necessity of it. As, two teaching good works necessary; he of them,
that should say they are so only out of gratitude; or as signs of true Faith
etc. would more weaken men's study of them. So, for Alms, and deeds of Charity;
he that should teach them necessary as a duty in obedience to a precept, not
also as a special means for procuring remission of sins, and receiving many as
well temporal as spiritual blessings from God etc, would more weaken men's
practice of them. So, for Fasting; he that should teach it to be a means indeed
to weaken our lusts, but no duty required by God.

. 50.
6. Not harkening to your reason against what seems clear Revelation; nor
against strongly-confirmed Tradition; or common Ecclesiastical History; nor
against the professed experience of other Saints of God. That Philosophical
Caution (...) seems mischievous in Divinity, especially against the common
authority and credulity of so many others. And that thing may be most credible
and conformable to a well-rectified Reason that disagrees with ours as yet not
so clear-sighted, or otherwise prejudiced and mis-seasoned. Not opposing God's
wisdom, or justice, (such as we fancy them) to what is his work; or his Power,
to what is his promise; and not stating, what is, and what is not, to him
possible; But captivating our reason for other things (in the former
Circumstances) as far as we do for the Trinity. For our Reason is very weak;
and all true Reason has an anti-reason, and verity, a verisimility, always
opposing it.

7. Taking heed also of using negative argumentations from former Authority
against better: As, That if such a thing were a truth; or a truth of such
consequence, It would have been mentioned by our Lord, the Apostles, the
Fathers of such, and such times. As, if any, in the Apostles times, should have
argued, That the Mosaical Ceremonies were not abrogated by Christ, because our
Lord (who foresaw such a grand Controversy) yet in the Gospels has expressly
said nothing of nullifying them. Or again; That he had said nothing of them,
because the Apostles quote not any such his commands. Or should have argued,
That the Gentiles were not to be admitted into the Church, etc. because so many
at Pentecost when inspired with the Holy Ghost, as yet knew nothing of it; Or,
because afterward it (a matter of such consequence) was revealed to none of the
rest; and discovered to Peter only by a Vision and an Experiment (See Acts
11.3.15. comp. Act. 10.28.34.) not by a clear command. Again, Not rejecting any
thing as the Invention or Institution only of later times, from this negative
arguing, That it cannot be showed in the Writings, Histories, or Registers of
the former; For many things may be believed or practiced in such times when
they are not mentioned in the Records thereof: Especially if those times less
abound with Writings. Nor is every thing to be concluded new, that is newly
spoken of, or agitated. Which agitation first happens to be upon some new
opposition made to things formerly received. Not using also Negative
Argumentations from former times, to the disparaging or dissuading any practice
of the later on this account, such practice was not in former, or then was less
frequent. For many such very beneficial for the augmenting of Piety or Devotion
may be discovered, or also instituted anew in any age. And it is a sufficient
license of them, if nothing therein can be showed contrary to the Divine
Prohibitions, or Commands. The same thing also may be said concerning the
Divine Favors and Honors done to God's Servants and Saints; not in all ages
perhaps dispensed altogether after the same manner, but some more frequent in
one, some in another. And, for such varying practices of later Church, or
Favors of the Divine Grace, if a considerable benefit appears of the first,
and an evident proof of the second ( Voluntas Dei, as St. Austine De Inventione
S. Stephani, Fidem quaerit, non quaestionem), this is sufficient for allaying
our further inquisition; and establishing our acquiescence in them. For God
seems to be pleased that the successive ages of the World should be entertained
with some variety; And the Economy of the Church after Constantine's times
differing in many things from the former, yet was entertained with general
approbation.

. 51.
Digr. Of the great confidence, and little strength (notwithstanding the
conformity which truth has to the Intellect beyond error;) of Humane Reason
(made mostwhat a slave to our secular Interests and Passions) discerned by the
serious contemplation: 1. Of the learned of one nation (from several education,
and interest, and concatenation of Tenants) embracing a contrary Sect of
Religion, to those of another; both with the same zeal, and pretended evidence
on their side; (yet both perusing the same Scriptures, and one another's
Arguments): And this so unanimously; that it is almost a Miracle, if one among
many hundreds deserts his Party. So that, as any one happens to be educated in
his Studies: For Example, in Spain, or in England, accordingly he is prepared
to suffer the like Martyrdom in Defense of the Roman, or the Reformed,
Tenants. 2. Of the general change of Opinions, upon the mutation, and a
contrary influence of the Civil State; the new Opinions after a while being as
universally asserted, as, before, the other were; and that amongst the Learned.
3. Of the confidence, and resolution that any one, who since has changed his
Tenants, may remember he had once in his former, before the discovery of his
error. All which is said, not as if all Opinions are equally probable and
tenible; or, that error in most men proceeds not from a faulty ignorance, and
so is answerable-for; (as also is truth it self, when taken up only on the same
Grounds as others do their Errors:) But, upon our Liability to guilt in our
misperswasions, therefore to excite a perpetual care and jealousy of secular
Concerns and Prejudices their not corrupting our Judgment.

8. Not depending on your own Judgment (commonly mixed with much self-interest,
tho unperceived) in the sense of Scriptures (many times not well studied, and
compared by men, who are of other ordinary employments); since we see those,
who have them most common, in their not submitting to Ecclesiastical Authority,
and direction, to run into most diversity, and absurdities of Opinions. Often
meditating therefore on these following Propositions for keeping you more
steady in your obedience.

1. That, tho the exercise of private men's judgments in all things be allowed,
Yet is not its erring hereby excused in their not informing it aright, or in
their not performing a submission thereof to whom such submission is enjoined.
And, that the charging Christians in general to beware of false Prophets,
Seducers, and blind Guides, does still bind them more closely to obedience of
their true Guides, so long as they have sufficient evidence left them, who are
so. Of which, See n. 6.

2. That it is necessary to follow the judgment of the Church ( i. e. of the
Ministers thereof, delegated by our Lord, and having his promise of perpetual
assistance) where universally agreeing in any thing; tho this thing be contrary
to your own Judgment or Reason concerning it.

3. That (in Churches divided) it is more safe to follow the judgment of any
Church; than your own opposite to all. For the Contrary to these two seems a
too great Presumption.

4. That, as it is lawful to appeal from one Teacher to another, from the
Inferior to the Superior, so never from all (after you have proposed and they
disallowed your reasons) to the Scriptures, as you (alone, or with an
inconsiderable party in respect of the whole) do interpret them.

5. That you have a charge, not to contend or dispute with, but to obey and
submit your self to, those, who have the spiritual rule over you; who watch for
your soul, and who must give account for it thus far: That they have declared
unto you all the Counsel of God ( Hos. 4.4. Heb. 13.17. Act. 20.20.27.26.); who
were given by Christ, that we should not by the slight of men be carried about
with every wind of Doctrines, Ephesians. 4.11. comp. 14. who have more ability to
judge; and more assistance promised not to mistake. To submit unto these I say,
as unto Christ himself, See 2. Cor. 2.10. Ephesians. 5.22. -- 6.7. (which holds a
minori ad majus) whom absent they represent to you, 2. Cor. 5.19, 20. Knowing,
that the greatest difficulty of Salvation lies not in discerning whether they
rightly direct, but in doing what they direct you to.

6. That, in any disagreement of these our Ecclesiastical Superiors, such our
Obedience and Submission of judgment is due to those, who among them have the
greater and higher authority, our Lord for this reason having instituted them,
not equipotential, or independent one of another, but in a due Subordination
and Super-intendency, that their Subjects, in any their clashing, may know both
as to single Persons, and Councils, to whom they ought to adhere. And they are
much to be avoided, who would induce an Equality and a Parity into the Clergy;
which inferrs a Confusion of Doctrines and Opinions. And it is the same, among
them levelled, to obey whom of them we please, as to be tied to obey none at all.

7. That, tho all true Faith is grounded on, or ultimately resolved into,
something which is infallible (i. e.) God's word (whether written, or not); yet
it is not required to a true and saving Faith, that every one should know, and
be able to prove infallibly that that which he believes (perhaps taught him
only by his Pastor, or Parents, who may lie) is God's word. The greatest Proof
of which ( viz. that the object of his Faith is God's Word) is universal
Tradition: which universal Tradition, if it also be supposed infallible, yet
cannot every one be infallibly certain that the Tradition concerning the matter
of his Faith has been Universal; which Tradition all true Believers cannot, or
have not leisure, to examine. That therefore a true and saving Faith requires
not this condition, that one be infallibly certain of, or can demonstrate, it.
That, if it did, one is no way nearer to a certainty of Truth, and Faith, by
using his own fallible reason to find it out, than by relying on a more learned
man to show it to him; who perhaps may give him a much clearer evidence thereof
than he himself can discover. And if the fallibility in another hinders that
you cannot safely rely on his Judgment, the same fallibility in your self
exacts that you do not rely on your own. And whatever evidences, whether from
Divine Revelation, Reason, or Sense, your self has for not erring, the same
your spiritual Superior has, or also more.

8. That the believing or practicing a thing against our own Reason or
Judgment, abstractively taken concerning the thing, ( i. e. when all our own
Reasons concerning it tend to persuade us, that such a thing is erroneous or
unlawful), cannot be going against our judgment or conscience absolutely; or
this being taken for that Reason or Judgment which is of two contrary the more
prevalent in us: and so long as we have some other Reason concerning the
credibility of some person, who declares such Doctrine not erroneous or
Practice unlawful, which sways us against those former Reasons we had
concerning the erroneousness or unlawfulness of the thing; namely, this Reason,
that we ought, upon some weighty considerations, rather to follow an another
Reason, or Judgment concerning such thing, than our own. For here, the
relinquishing our Judgment in one sense, is in another sense following it. And
he would offend against his Conscience or Judgment, who judging or being
persuaded that he ought to submit his Judgment to another, should
notwithstanding practice contrary. And such persuasion also is ordinary, when
we know others either more wise, or experienced than our selves; or also such
who are authorized in such matters to direct and guide us.

9. That, supposing only such an infallibility promised to, or instated by our
Lord on, his Church, or on our Superiors (I mean, those declared such n. 6.) as
that it shall not err in necessaries, and that Salvation may always be had in
it, this seems abundantly sufficient for establishing an absolute obedience
unto it in all its Decisions. Because in submitting to all these (for which
submission we have good reason, so long as we ought to think these our
Superiors more wise, learned, and holy than our selves) we are secured not to
err in necessaries, nor to be such blind followers of the blind, as that both
shall fall into the ditch; But in our non-submission, we may err in
necessaries, so long as our selves can make no certain distinction between
things that are or are not so. And again; in such non-submission, where
Submission is due, tho we happen to retain all truths still necessary to
salvation, yet here in dissenting and departing from the Church, or such
Superiors, we shall stand guilty of Schism and Breach of her Unity or
Communion; and so on this account miscarry in our Salvation.

10. That if the Church, succeeding the Apostles, had any Authority as to
stating matters of Controversy, it has in all times an equal; and which lays
an equal Obligation on its Subjects. And that several Controversies also are
such, as must be decided not by the former but the present Church. As this
Controversy, What former Counsels are to be accounted General, Legal,
Obligatory: Or, What is, in any point debated, the Sense of Antiquity, etc.

11. That all the Church's new Determinations, or Injunctions, in what ever
time passed, are never done but for some seeming to-her-cogent Reason or
necessity thereof. Viz. Upon some error and opposition to Doctrines or
Practices formerly received; or, to some by-her-deemed necessary consequents
thereof; which error permitted against the latter, must by the Sequel ruin the
former. And thus came, justly, the Athanasian Creed to be larger than the
Apostles. And the same authority has the Church of later Ages to add more
Articles to this Creed, as the Church of that age had to add these to the
Apostles Creed. And here note concerning such necessary Consequents, That if
any Article of Faith is contained in Scripture, so are all the necessary
Consequents thereof: And then, that these also when known by us to be such, are
all necessary to be believed; tho it is not necessary, that also we know them
to be such; Nor necessary, in assenting to all things which we know the Church
has determined or decreed, that we know all her Decrees; or that we may not
inculpably hold something otherwise than the Church does, till we know what she
holds therein.

12. That our Obedience to our spiritual Superiors, for any decisive authority
in Controversies of Religion committed and delegated to them by our Lord, is
not duly performed, so long as done with these limitations; viz. Obeying and
assenting to them so far as we think or judge their Decisions agreeing with
God's Word: Or, so far, as agreeing with right ( i.e. with our own) Reason (for
only, what seems to us right Reason, we call so): For indeed, he, that will
first judge concerning these where they judge aright; and only obey for so
much; submits not at all to theirs, but his own, judgment. Qui obediunt propter
judicium proprium, sibi, non aliis, obediunt. Nor, herein do we more observe or
conform to theirs, than we would do to the advice of a Friend or Servant, viz.
Where we think these say right.

Some of these precedent Propositions well digested may stand you in some
stead: For fixing your obedience to Spiritual Superiors; and, in it, practicing
Christian Humility, and a Denial in what is most your self; and preventing
Disputation and Skepticism in things established; and lastly, for enjoying much
quietness of mind.

. 58.
5. Industry, and a Vocation.
5. Industry in some Vocation. (i. e.) 1. Serving God, and being instrumental
to his providence in some Employment, for supplying those necessities
Spiritual; Civil; or Natural; which God has ordained to be conveyed to men,
only by the ministry of men.

2. Following it without digressions into other curious, or needless
employments, or desire to be aliquis in omnibus. And (if it may be) having a
design of some particular good accrewing to your self or your neighbor in your
labor, by it to sanctify your work, and excite your diligence.

3. Entertaining no employment, that excludes a sufficient vacancy for your
Devotions.

4. Ordering still beforehand, and, where it is much, setting down in writing,
your business; which strengthens the performance, and prevents divertisements.

5. Keeping a certain, and constant order in your daily employments, as far as
they are capable thereof. Qui been ordinat diem, been ordinat vitam, life being
only a collection, and total sum of so many days.

6. Taking special care of the beginning of your employments in the morning;
and after meals; which then begun well, are easily continued; but ill, and
vainly, are not so easily changed.

7. Using your recreations not before, but after, your employments, because you
will experience, that to get most of your time which is taken in hand first.

8. Not doing business hastily, or passionately, or many at once; for all these
much hinder the acts of reason, and judgment, in the managing of them; but
dispatching things allway successively rather; and in a certain order, with a
reposed Spirit, and without excessive thought.

9. Avoiding in all things taedium mentis (for it is some delight that keeps a
man in his work, nor will he persevere without it): the chief remedy whereof is
an admixture of some variety: variety both of our employments; and, in the same
employment, of the postures of the body (as sitting, walking, lying, etc.) and
of the accidental and by-entertainments of the senses, (as several rooms,
prospects, being in the House, in the Field, in a Church, etc.) by which the
intention of the mind is much recreated; and better thus to afford some content
to nature, than (which is worse) quite to desist from an holy, or otherwise
profitable, exercise out of irksomeness.

10. Keeping a strict account of your expense of two things: your Time; being
that in which you are now to purchase Salvation in eternity: And your Money, or
Goods; all the spare thereof being the Portion of the poor; and this in order
to your Salvation also (see Luke 16.9.) those eternal houses, in this sense,
being also to be bought with money: Often accounts for what is past, helps much
to prevent mis-expence for the future: Edicat quid absumpserit; ita fiet, ut
non absumat, quod pudeat dicere.

11. Doing all your temporal business in the name of Christ ( Col. 3.17.23.) to
the glory of God (1. Cor. 10.31.) whereby all your secular actions may become
(as it were) consecrated, religious, and holy duties.

12. Never neglecting your vocation, and duty, to cover an infirmity, or avoid
obloquy, etc. But glorifying (and so increasing your reward with) God in
serving him (in your appointed station) through the impotency of your nature;
dishonor and infamy from men.

Digr. Neglect of public duty not excused, and made amends for, by private
integrity or good endeavors, that are besides our profession.

13. Not being discouraged in the works of your Vocation, by ill success. God
loving your patience in well-doing as much as another man's fruitfulness (which
is indeed only from him) and rewarding us according to the working, rather than
the work. ( Esaias. 49.4.)

14. Before every distinct business (small or great) using a brief Invocation
of God for his help, and benediction (with some reverence used of the Body); as
it is usual before eating. 1. Cor. 10.31. [or whatsoever ye do.] This religious
preparation will add more confidence, and courage in your labors.

15. In matters of great moment, or much concernment, before any resolution
made about them, Using the preparations of Fasting, and other Mortifications;
of Prayer, your own and others ( Act. 12.5.12.) (for God loves to be courted,
and sought to by his servants, before he bestows his favors); of counsel even
from Inferiors; by whom many times God sends Advice; Deus saepe revelat
parvulis. For the same reason, to those surprising us with a proposal, not
giving a sudden, and extempore answer, about matters of importance; but soberly
desiring time to consider (i. e.) to recommend them to God in your Prayers.

16. Observing, and setting down the affections, and inclinations of your Soul,
in, and after, your Prayer made to God; By which many times He does (not
obscurely) reveal his pleasure to those, who wait for it, touching the
particulars wherein they consult Him.

17. For making your election where two things of consequence are doubtful
which of them should be done, Bringing your self, for as much as concerns
self-interest, ( i. e. as to sensual pleasure, profit, honor, wealth, etc.)
into an equilibrium, and indifferency between both, that so you may embrace
that, which simply more advances God's glory, the end of your Creation. And if
thus you do consider things deliberated on, not in order to your own pleasure,
profit, or other Secular satisfaction, but merely in order to the Glory and
Service of God (for which you were created) and for attaining Salvation, in
most proposals this question or doubting will be immediately without any
difficulty decided by the Director of your conscience, or rather of God's
Spirit; and so you certainly know God's Will and what he would have you do.

18. But in those subjects of Consultation, wherein remains some further
difficulty: The better to acquire this indifferency, and impartiality, and to
make a right choice,

1. Set down the several advancements of God's glory, or hindrances thereof,
on both sides; and so compare these. Such deliberation, and trial, being a good
way to exclude affections. 2. Then betake your self to Prayer and the other
means prescribed n. 15. observing whether, after this, your mind does with much
repose and satisfaction, and without having used much discourse to persuade it,
acquiess in any side: For this is a great Index to you of the Divine good
pleasure, that such thing should be done, or prosecuted. 3. The mind not thus
settled, ask counsel of your Ghostly Father, or other Spiritual persons, (for
these, abstracting their thoughts more from temporal engagements, are likely to
give you the most wholesome advice): desiring God, that by them he would declare
his will unto you; and so follow their Directions. 4. In defect of these,
choose, what, if you knew you were to dye shortly, you should rather embrace:
for this seems more divested of secular ends. 5. What you suppose one,
mortified to the world, would take. 6. What you would advise another to, that
asked your judgment. 7. What you think an holy man, being asked his judgment,
would advise to. 8. Generally decree rather against that side, which your sense
pleads for, as more grateful to it.
. 59.
Digr. Of The several more noble, and advantageous Vocations of the Gentry; and
of there being two motives of daily labor; One, that we may eat our own bread
(2. These. 3.12.) the Other, that we may have to give to him that needs, and
that others may eat of our bread ( Ephesians. 4.28.) That who so needs not to work
for the first reason: yet he (if busied in no other employment more beneficial
to the public) has it recommended to him for the second. Neither does a
plentiful inheritance, whereby he relieves the Poor, frustrate this Counsel.
Since he gives what is more his own, who gives of what he gets; than who
gives only of what he possesses; and as he that relieves them with the one,
does well, so he that with both, does better. See Act. 9.39.

. 60.
6. Contentedness and Indifferency
6. 1. Contentedness and acquiescence in your present, and indifferency for
your future, condition, and employment, ( Eccl. 6.9.)

Digr. Of the ordinary temptations of desiring to change it; from a false
conceit, that we shall live with less encumbrances, and temptations in another:
That we shall serve God better, or do more good in some other.

2. Reserving (except in order to the advancing of God's Service) an
indifferency to all accidents, and success; and reconcilement to all conditions
of Life, (rich, poor, active, retired, etc.) and a compliance of mind to all
employments; as if those only, which you are in, complied with you. Who so thus
remits himself to God's pleasure, never fails of obtaining his desire; because,
he desires only what happens; and has much more cheerfulness, because less
business, than the daily contrivers of their Fortunes.

3. For the future, entertaining no designs at all (beyond the ordinary
employments of your present Vocation, or someway respecting it); these being
the chief causes of great passions, and discontents. Especially not any that
looks very far off: desiring always to be, what for the present you are; (Quod
sis esse velis, nihilque malis). Knowing, that (in a diligent and conscionable
minding of your present business) the more you put your self (for to morrow)
out of the guidance, and conduct of your own humane wisdom, the more you are
received into the tuition of God's. And by this non-solicitude do avoid, the
languishing impatience of non-possession, the violence (often not without envy,
malice, flattery, etc.) of a prosecution, and lastly, the despair, and misery
of a disappointment (as it more often happens) of your desires.

4. Or, if not this, at least entertaining no great designs; none singular, or
eminent; but having as many, and as small, as you can, (and these also be
rather suspensive, and doabting, desires with remission of the issue to God,
than fixed, and peremptory resolves). For the smaller they are, the less will
your passion be after them; and the less the danger of a rival to prevent you
in them; and the more they are, the more indifferent will you be to any of
them: So that, defeated of one, you can easily transfer your thoughts upon a
second; a third; (As for Example: One dubiously proposing with himself, either
such an employment, for doing the more good abroad; or else such a retirement,
for better following his own Devotions; put-by the first, he will more easily
repair to, and content himself with the second.

5. In the prosecution of your designs (assuredly lawful, where there is no
special interest of Piety) going on cheerfully in two cases especially. 1.
Where you find any strong inclinations of your will, and a way much
facilitated, and as it were offering it self unto you: For, that our heart, and
way is thus prepared, we have reason to presume (in things lawful) is from God.
2. Where you find (though against your inclination) a course that is as it were
necessitated to you (Suppose from the power others have over you, or from the
indigence of your fortunes) For our wills may also take counsel of the flesh;
and the necessity, we find thwarting our desires, we have reason to presume is
from the ordination of God.

6. Being as ready to desist; especially in two cases. 1. Where, a thing being
suggested by others, yet no necessity presses you; and, after having also
recommended it in your Prayers, there remains an aversion of your will to it.
2. When, there being no aversion of your will, yet your desires find in the
prosecution much impediment, and also difficulty. For this, or no way
(Revelations being extraordinary) God declares his pleasure unto you: (i. e.)
either in averting internally your will; or in externally opposing your
endeavors.

7. Practicing content, and indifferency, and submitting to God's appointments,
in any little displeasures that happen to you, Not thinking any small thing
below the exercise of this virtue; for by this often employing of your
quietness of mind upon quotidian inconveniences, it will grow stronger for
greater occasions.

8. Fortifying your self against discontent more especially in the beginning
and newness of a misfortune, or change of your condition: Time, and a little
accustomance to a new (tho worse) state of life, being a certain cure of all
inquietude: Chiefly endeavoring to acquire this indifferency also for short,
and long, life (the thing wherein we use to be the least resigned): A
conformity to the Divine Will being a much more acceptable Sacrifice to God,
where more difficulty and reluctance of Nature. Which indifferency is more
easily acquired by frequent cogitations and discourses of Death and converse
with the sick, rendering it less terrible to us; being a thing more strange and
surprising because all avoid the fore-thinking of it.

9. In the discontents also, melancholies, sadness, aridities, barrenness,
morosities, disgusts, desolations of the soul; which, in the with-drawings, and
absence of the Spirit the Comforter, will sometimes happen to the best of men;
happen I say from some greater deprivation of present secular contents; from
the length of their sufferings; and the remoteness of their reward or release;
but most commonly, from an indisposition of the body, when the Spirits after
much industry are spent, and grow heavy, and dull; or when some cold humors
more abound (from whence these dejections are observed to be more frequently
toward the Evening;) these desolations being a more special time of
temptations from the Evil Spirit: First, Not resolving, or executing any thing,
and refusing your own counsel, till such a fit be past. Well considering the
Cause; and so neglecting, and not heeding your present thoughts; calling to
mind former consolation, and that your mind was not long since, and e're long
will be again, of another complexion. Forcing your self to pray, (St. James's
his Advice, c. 5.13.) though you can little mind it. Exercising some act of
praise, and loving God, in expressions opposite to your present thinkings (as
Cant. 1.3. -- 2.16. Romans 8.35.37. the 23d, 25th, or some other Psalm recited.)
Meditating on the joys to come. On our Savior and the Saints persevering in
God's Service in the greatest wants of all worldly contents; and joying in
these wants, because of a so much greater reward to come. Singing some
spiritual Hymn, or Sonnet; which singing will excite your spirits. Taking up,
and reading the Scripture, or some pious Book. Repeating the Beatitudes ( Matt.
5.) together with the woes ( Luke 6.) Employing the mind about any other thing
(save minding it self, or that which it is then doing): as in some external
occupations, or honest recreations; any way refreshing, and heating your
Spirits; Melancholy being of a cold, and dry temper; Only taking heed of not
turning aside (to remedy it) to any intemperance, or other unlawful sensual
delight. Emptying the Soul of some parts of its sadness, by communicating it to
a spiritual friend; who also may infuse into you some of his Comforts. After
such remedies used, the evil not expelled, patiently as always, entertaining it
for God's, and your sins sake; and making of it to contemplate your own natural
we akness.

. 61.
Digr. Of the viciousness, and malignancy of Envy; and that no good man is
liable to this passion; for he that envies another's temporal good, is not yet
himself weaned from the world: Or spiritual; does not truly love God, and the
advancement (every way) of his glory: For such will say with Moses, Numb.
11.29. Would God, etc.

. 62.
2. To your Neighbor.
II. Duties to our Neighbor.

1. All Duties to our Neighbor, more carefully, to be performed (amongst them)
to the Godly, and the Members of our Savior.

First, JUSTICE.

1. In doing no Wrong.

1. Not defrauding ( Mark. 10.19.) Not detracting, and defaming, etc. Not
flattering, etc. 2. Such things done, making restitution, satisfaction, etc. 3.
Asking forgiveness of, and suing for peace to, the injured.
. 63.
2. In doing all Right.

1. To those who are set over you (whether Ecclesiastical, or the Civil, or
your Domestic, Governors, as Parents, or Masters) dutiful obedience in all
things ( Col. 3.20.22.) as unto the Lord Jesus (believing most certainly, that
it is he that governs, and commands you by them. ( Ephesians. 5.22. -- 6, 7.) without
resisting ( Romans 13.2.) Especially to Parents; to our Spiritual Fathers, our
Pastors; and to our Spiritual Mother, the Church. See p.

2. To those you are set over (especially to your Family; and in it as well to
Servants, as Children) careful government, provision, etc. as being to them in
the place of the Lord ( Deuteronomy. 1.77. -- 2. Chron. 19.6. Romans 13.4.) with all
gravity (1. Tim. 3, 4.): but without rigor, etc. (See Gentleness recommended to
Superiors Levit. 25.43. Ephesians. 6.4.9. Col. 3.21.): Sparing in Commands; but
diligently exacting obedience. So Princes, to make Laws sparingly; rigidly to
execute them.

3. To all that you deal with, honest negotiation.

. 64.
1. In this; 1 Not speaking an untruth. 2 Not speaking a truth, to deceive. 3
Not concealing a truth, to deceive. 4 Not taking advantage of the necessities,
or ignorance, the richness, or conveniences of the Contractor. 5 And to the
poor showing some indulgence. Using veracity, and Christian Simplicity;
avoiding in all things dissimulation, and Hypocrisy; using fidelity in not
telling tales; especially in not betraying secrets; ( Ecclesiasticus 27.21.24.)
En la boca del discreto, lo publico es secreto.

2. Keeping religiously all covenants, and not altered according to after
accidents.

. 65.
Digr. 1. Of the heinous crime of lying, and deceiving. 1. Th. 4.6.

2. Of the heinousness of perjury, and breach of promises, covenants, etc. Even
those.

1. Made out of fear. 2. Or which others have compassed by fraud. See Josh.
9.3. comp. 2. Sam. 21.1, 2. 3. Or where others do violate their faith to us.
3. Of God's special vengeance (as it is specially invoked in making them) upon
violation of solemn Covenants.

Secondly, MERCY: And Thirdly, LOVE.

. 66.
1. In doing no hurt.

1. Reverencing the absent, and being very jealous of your behavior concerning
them.

1. Not speaking evil of them, tho a truth, unless notoriously known, and in a
case of some necessity. Not doing it always then, even when it may seem some
way to tend either to their amendment we speak of: Or theirs, we speak to: for
this pretense (mostwhat) is only a temptation

2 Lastly, when the faults are such, as, for the offenders, or also for the
common, good, are not to be concealed, speaking of them only to those who can
remedy them: i. e. to the person that offends, or to the Superior, (and this
with all humility; but not speaking of them to others, least so be introduced a
custom of detracting. Of which much silence is an happy cure. Endeavoring
still in part to excuse them when you are forced to relate their faults; or
when you hear them blamed by others: for so those do who truly love another;
(for charitable affections have always a charitable judgment; and, if we
pretend to love our Neighbor as our selves, we ought to excuse him, because we
usually do excuse our selves); And so those do who constantly remember their
own infirmities. Besides, that a custom of excusing much, checks another
male-dicency: and men do not so freely blame, and censure, where they perceive
it does not please; and so covering the others fault rectifies also theirs.

3. When you must speak of them, imagining them present, and hearing you; or
that you speak to another to relate it unto them. In general approaching when
people are absent, as it were nearer to flattery; when present, to detraction.

2. Not discommending other men's works, and doings; (Especially not those of
Governors) Jam. 4.11. Jude 8.9. not diminishing, or dissembling, their good
parts. etc.

3. Not censuring etc. Especially in the points of God's Judgments: Remembering
Job; the Galileans; and the born-blind.

Digr. That, ordinarily, no good man is so good, nor wicked man so bad, 1. Cor.
13. Charity thinks no evil -- rejoiceth not in iniquity -- hops all things,
believes all [good] things.
as men commonly imagine. As is experienced by much conversation with either,
after such an opinion first had of them.

4. 1. Not enquiring into, avoiding the knowledge of, the defects etc. of your
Neighbor (who is busy to mark can hardly abstain from censuring) 2. thinking
no ill. 1. Cor. 23.3. Not hearing willingly, 4. Not believing ill reports of
them. 5. Excusing; 6. Especially never ill interpreting their intentions: never
saying, they did such a thing out of pure wilfulness, despite, and malice.
(Mat. 7.1.) 7. Forgiving, and not returning evil for evil. 8. Praying for their
forgiveness from God. 9. Loving, and Praying for, them (this being a more
special duty of the Gospel.) 10. Especially forgiving Errors; and being
charitable to other men's contrary opinions, and judgment; which charitableness
cannot well be without an humble, and mean conceit of our own wisdom;
therefore toward this difference in opinion we use to be far more
uncharitable, than toward vice: Because who agree not in opinion seem to
disparage our judgment, and upbraid us of Error; But the vicious render us
appearing to our selves the more righteous. Now we naturally tolerate any thing
that advances us in our own conceit; nothing, that depresseth us. 11. Not
requiring satisfaction for losses. Seek^ not her own -- bears all things.
12. In smaller matters not vindicating your innocence aspersed by them. 13.
Not relating their faults against you for their disgrace (this being one kind
of revenge): talking, afterward, of men's trespasses is a manifest imperfection
in our forgiveness. 14. Preparing your self to receive more injury, and loss,
rather than contend with them. 15. Seeking for peace to those, who have injured
you, with telling them privately their fault. 16. Not envying them (1. Cor.
13.4.) 17. Esteeming them better than your self. Envieth not: is not puffed up.
18. Submitting not only to Magistrates, but even to one another, out of pure
humility ( Ephesians. 5.21. -- 1. Pet. 5.5. Romans 12.10.)

Digr. 1. Recommendation of forbearing just suits, and contentions for our
right (1. Cor. 6.7. Psalm. 69.4.) especially in smaller matters; being sure,
that God will make us amends some other way. This rule obligatory to Kingdoms,
and States (one toward another); as well as to private men. As likewise
States, and Magistrates, to show all mercy in inflicting of punishments.

. 67.
2. In doing all Good.

1. There being two grounds of doing good, and exercising charity to your
Neighbor. 1. The love of God, to whom our Neighbor has relation, and whom
God has a care of; and so we also are taking care of him to please God, 2. And
particular affections to our Neighbor, from the relations we have to him; or
qualities we approve in him, etc; Building your well doing chiefly upon the
first of these, for so it will be more sure, and more universal. And this
ground ought often to be meditated on, to excite you to well-doing; and to
teach you to love them, as his friends, rather than your own.

2. Returning; 1. good for good, for this is gratitude. 2. Good, from whence no
Evil; Humanity. 3. Good for Evil; Christianity: and the first trial, whether
our Love to our Neighbor be for God's sake; and such as is commanded. 4. When
another's good and yours cross, preferring their good (when considerably
greater) before your own; persection. As; your Neighbors great benefit in his
goods, or affairs, before a smaller loss, and hinderance in your own; your
Neighbors life, before your own goods; your Neighbors Salvation, before your
life. etc. 1. Jo. 3.16.

Of Alms, and Deeds of CHARITY.

. 68.
3. Showing Mercy to all Creatures whatsoever capable of it; particularly those
under your command; in using them kindly, providing for them, etc. (See Lev.
25.53. -- 22.24.28. Deuteronomy. 25.3, 4.)

4. Showing Mercy to your Neighbor; not only for his body, and his estate;
but, above all, to his Soul, in any kind you may.

5. Showing what Mercy you can to the faulty; in not punishing them (when you
are forced to it) with rigor. See Zech. 1.15. -- 2. Chron. 28.9. Esaias. 47.6.
Ps. 69.26.27. Amos 1.3.6.19.13.) nor adding more affliction to misery. Ps.
109.16. Phil. 1.16. Jer. 48.27.

6. Showing Charity, and Mercy, especially to Saints, in a more careful manner,
than to others; (Since all poor do not equally bear the image of Christ; and
God's providence is especially sollicitous for his servants, ( Matt. 35.43. 1.
Tim. 4.10. Deuteronomy. 11.21. Matt. 10.42.) whose Mercies we are in every thing to
imitate, Gal. 6.10.) and, amongst these again, especially and in particular, to
his Priests.

7. Addicting your self to some particular kind of Charity more than the rest;
that your minding, chiefly, one thing, may make you more beneficial herein to
your Neighbor.

8. Your Charity, and Alms; 1. not to be casual, but regular (tasking your self
to a monthly, weekly, or daily, Alms, 1. Cor. 16.2.) 2. Proportionable to your
estate at the least; Those as this greater, a twentieth, a tenth part, etc. 3.
And this by no means less under the Gospel (which should be more liberal, Act.
2.44, 45.) than that which was commanded by God under the law, (See Deuteronomy.
14.28, 29. Levit. 19.10. Deuteronomy. 26.12.) 4. Set apart for, and your self seeking
out, (not solicited by) the necessitous.

Digr. Of the large proportion of Alms according to men's Estates that was
enjoined under the Law.

9. Being very frugal, and thrifty in all other expenses, to make the deeds of
Charity more abundant.

10. Not making your poverty, while you have in it something to spare (as he
has, who has something to spend vainly) an excuse to omit alms: Remembering
the commended poor widow ( Luke 21.4.) The persecuted, plundered, Macedonians
(2. Cor. 8.2, 3.) The day lalabourers working to have something to give. ( Ephesians.
4.28. 1. Cor. 16.2.) Our Savior's advice, where no ready alms, to sell, to
help other means wants. Much more, taking special heed, that your lusts rob not
the poor; nor yet your conveniences be preferred before their absolute
necessities; and the nearer still you are to want, being so much the readier to
give, that you may find like supplies in your own approaching poverty.

. 69.
Digr. 1. Of the much abused Text. 1. Tim. 5.8. spoken concerning Childrens
maintaining at home (and not obtruding upon the Church) their aged infirm
Parents with necessaries: (comp. 1. Tim. 5.4.16.) And being in general a duty
no further, than providing only for necessaries sooner for Relations nearer:
because none are bound to provide more than these for themselves; which is the
rule and measure of our duty, and obligation for others. It Is a lawful thing to
provide for our posterity according to, or also beyond the degree, and quality,
of their Ancestors, but far from a duty; and, whosoever's Family is not poor,
he does better, who makes further provision for the poor, than he, who for his
family. And doubtless rich Zacheus did no injustice to his children, in giving
half his goods to the poor; nor yet they, Act. 4.34. Nor they, Matt. 19.29.
Whose Relatives having necessaries, they were not further careful for their
wealth; and minded more their own eternal Salvation, than the temporal
abundance of theirs; which abundance also happens most commonly for men's hurt;
and the want of which, if it be convenient for me, is so also, for my child.

Digr. 2. Of the ordinary faulty obstructions to Charity. As maintaining our
selves according to our quality. Our being comparatively poor, though we are
not necessitous, See Luke 21.4. -- 2. Cor. 8.2, 3. Necessary provision, for old
age; -- for uncertain times; -- many children; -- many poor kindred; --
provision for our Family; -- chargeable recreations; -- false named
hospitality, and (truly uncharitable good-house-keeping, I mean such as
entertains the rich, not the poor, feeding not the hungry to satiety, but the
full to excess; -- debts, but these many times contracted by purchases, or high
marriages etc. -- The unworthiness and wickedness of those who demand our alms.

. 70.
11. Not omitting, or slighting the performance of small Charities. Mat. 10.42.

12. Not passing by regardless, but discoursing with poor; and being ready to
be informed by him of his necessities; this being an excellent way to force
your self to Charity, or to the enlargement of it: the tender-heartedness of
many (which God has given to man) escaping the relieving, only because they
will not know, men's wants.

Digr. 1. Of seeking objects, and occasions, of Charity [what the eye sees not,
the heart grieves not] and, Of the benefits we receive by objects of misery:
That Hospitals, and Prisons (those best Schools of Humiliation) are provided by
God, always ready to offer us occasions of deeds of Charity; which Charities
are so much greater, then others, by how much the object is more loathsome, and
offensive; and the more necessary, because most men avoid them: Eccl. 7.3, 4.

13. If your employments, or retirement affords you little conversation with
the world, committing your alms into the hands of some other pious,
tenderhearted, and discreet persons whose public affairs afford them often
occasion to meet, or also deal, with such objects of Charity; As to the Pastor,
to a Physician, or Surgeon, to the Officers appointed for the Poor, etc.

. 71.
A Catalogue of many several ways of showing CHARITY.

I. CHARITIES to the Soul of our Neighbor.

1. Endeavoring beyond all things in this world (and remembering the great
reward thereof, Jo. 4.36.) to save, and convert many, or, if but one Soul, that
is more precious than all this visible world to God; to save (I say) i. e. to
procure for it, such an infinite glory for ever, and ever: and the most
merciful God to be praised by it day, and night, without ceasing, for ever, and
ever. What pains of ours can be worthy of such an effect? What thanks will such
a Soul, when ravished in such bliss, and delivered from such torments, not give
unto us? And how will God love us, for thus procuring his greater eternal glory
from more of his Creatures. ( Luke 12.37.44.)

2. In which not neglecting also the least means, attending to it; tho but the
producing of one good thought, in the most abandoned to sinning; that God may
be at least in one moment by them (if not glorified, yet) not, or the less,
offended; and at least their future torments something diminished.

3. Helping your Neighbor with your Prayers tho unasked, especially when he is
in any very great distress.

4. Teaching, Catechizing, Children, gratis. Especially not neglecting herein
those of your own Family, or near Relation.

5. Going into Infidel Countries, or into the most ignorant, and untaught, or
heretical places of the Christian, to teach the Catholic Faith, and direct the
misguided. So also into Hospitals and Prisons on the same account, to the sick,
to the abandoned and desperate; which also may be to your self a beneficial
Mortification.

6. Counselling the doubting, that desire your advice. And, In giving any
spiritual Counsel, at the same time praying secretly in your mind to God, that
he (without whom it fructifies not) would open the heart to receive it.
Advising the party, if still obstinate, to recommend such a thing to God in his
Prayers; whose amendment perhaps God reserves to himself. 7. Establishing the
scrupulous. 8. Confirming the strong. 9. Encouraging to good works. 10.
Advising humiliations to the confident, especially when sick, and striving to
beget in them Acts of Repentance and a sense of their Sins; and above all
things avoiding the flattering, or begetting security in a Soul, which you
think is in an ill condition; and when lying under the hand of God's wrath.

7. Giving no scandal to the weak: And supporting, and tolerating them with all
patience.

8. Much compassionating, and condoling the afflicted; (our partaking, nay
aggravating, their grief to them much lessening it): And comforting them, tho
smitten of God; a temporal stroke many times saving and preventing an eternal.

9. Admonishing, reproving, sinners. Luke 3.19. And in Reproof using what
privacy you can; yet, in company, not forbearing it, when a sin committed
before the company; or, when no likelihood of other opportunity to do it
privately. Reprehending rather in the close of your converse, and discourse
with them, than at your first accost; and rather at some distance from
committing the fault; because such reprehension is less offensive. Not usually
reproving without some pre-commendations as to other things: Not reproving the
fact without some excusing (at least in part) of the intention, which only
known to God is never by us to be judged, or censured. In Admonition, and
Reprehension using the first person, including your self, rather than the
second; [We] rather than [You]. [ We should, or should not do thus, or thus. We
offend God in doing so and so]. Or sometimes, using the third. [Men ought, or
ought not, etc.] And in mentioning their faults delivering many times what you
have to say rather as from a third person [ some say: It is said; I was told,
etc.]

10. Correcting the refractory, when having authority to do it.

11. Quitting men of their fears; fear being many times a great torment.

12. Reconciling Enemies; and arbitrating and taking up differences between
friends: And procuring as much Charity (the greatest virtue) as you can between
all men; This being the greatest deed of Charity.

. 72.
II. CHARITIES to the Body.

1. Feeding the Hungry. Clothing the Naked. 3. Warming the Cold. Relieving
with money, or rather (for Money is often misspent) with victuals or cloths,
or in cold Seasons with fuel, a certain number of poor at your door on certain
days; or also sending such alms to their houses. Providing a private receipt
for Tickets, where the more bashful poor of honest families reduced to poverty
may make known their wants, and so be relieved Entertaining some poor at your
table on certain days; and exercising some acts of humility with, and toward,
them. In all supplying of the Poor's corporal, endeavoring also to relieve
their spiritual, Necessities, (as if their alms were made their wages for
saying our Lord's Prayer, Creed, or some part of their Catechism); where more
secular wants, there being commonly also more ignorance and poverty in
Spiritual things.

2. Visiting, tending on, the sick; especially the poor and helpless (those in
Hospitals, or in Prisons, etc.) providing necessaries for them, Physicians, a
stock of usual remedies for their diseases; praying with, reading to, them; and
helping any way their repentance in a time when Souls are most humble, pliant,
and best wrought upon; and procuring by all means their dying in God's fear.
Especially not rashly comforting the sick with Hopes of their recovery; whereby
they may be hindered from a due preparation for their death; or at least, lose
the benefit of their sickness, in their performance of the Acts of Humiliation,
Confession, Contrition, Prayer, etc, for which God sends it.

3. Visiting Prisons (and that with all indifferency to the distressed there,
that you may have a greater reward); Relieving their present wants; providing
necessary helps in their Sickness; the Divine Service to be celebrated among
them; and other needful instructions in Religion. Making collections for their
debts; and purchasing their freedom when in restraint for some smaller sum.
Hearing their complaints; and interceding to those to whom their sufferings
relate: soliciting their business where any injury seems done them; Expediting
their trial; and procuring a release or moderation of their punishment. And
accustoming your self to be frequent in such houses of mourning and
mortifications, and where your self also may incur some sufferings.

4. Especially visiting the sick that are hopeless of recovery; Prisoners and
Malefactors, after condemned to dye: Moderating their sorrows, and despairs;
helping their repentance; Inviting them to confession; and directing them how
to make it; especially, in respect of wrongs to their Neighbors; instructing,
where need, their ignorance; accompanying them to the place of execution; and
using all means to guard them from the Temptations of the Devil, in that most
perilous hour; hoping that a broken and a contrite heart God will never
despise. If no way fit to do such office your self, procuring some Holy man,
who abounds in Charity, and Humility, to assist them in such extremities, and
to comfort and prepare them for a penitent and happy end.

5. Furnishing and maintaining Apothecaries shops abounding with all sorts of
Druggs, Compositions, and Remedies for all sorts of Diseases gratis for the
poor within such a parish, or larger Circuit. Or (which is the practice of many
charitable Ladies and Gentlewomen) making a plentiful provision of such
Medicines, Cordials, Balsomes, in your own house, for their relief, according
to the directions of the skilful.

6. Redeeming Captive Christians.

7. Entertaining, and furnishing necessaries to, the stranger, and traveller,
Luk, 10.33.

8. Burying the Dead; i. e. taking care of the decent burial of their body;
preserving of their good name; and doing those favors in their unperfected
affairs, which you would do for them if yet living; and which you would desire,
after your decease, others should do for you.

III. CHARITIES to Him in his Estate.

1. Lending Money without Interest, and tho with hazard of losing it ( Matt.
5.42. Deuteronomy. 15.8, 9.24.13. Eccl. 29.8, 9. Luke 6.35.)

2. Forgiving debts to the necessitous; Remitting forfeitures, and other your
rights.

3. Delivering the Poor from his Oppressors; and defending his (just) cause
against the rich and powerful. Esai. 1.17. -- 58.6. Psalm. 82.4.

Digr. Of our obligation under the Gospel toward all Christians equal to that
of the Jews toward their Brethren; i. e. those of the same Nation. And, of the
plentiful Alms enjoined to them by the law of Moses.

IV. CHARITIES more Universal.

1. Building or repairing houses of God's Service. Highways, Bridges. 2.
Endowing Churches wanting Means. 3. And more Ministry in great Parishes, or
necessary places.

2. Furnishing Divinity Lectures; Catechists for Children; Readers of the
Divine Service daily in Churches, especially those in greater Towns.

3. Erecting Schools of Learning, with Orders of a strict Discipline; Colleges
of Retirement from the world, with a more strict, frequent, and orderly,
practice of their Devotions, and Sobriety of diet. And these for both Sexes
being single persons, with clausure, if need be for the women. And it seems
tending much to many men's Salvation, if these Colleges were instituted not
only for receiving the Aged, or Insirm, but young persons also in whom the
crosses, troubles, or vanities of this world have wrought the same inclination
to a retreat from it, as old age, or diseases have caused in others. For if any
extraordinary happiness may be thought in such a life freed from cares and
attent to their Devotions, why may it not be enlarged to others besides these?
Younger, I mean such as shall contribute the value of their charges without
damaging the Foundation. Which also may occasion to the wealthy a pious
distribution of what they have superfluous. Always, provided, that, besides the
practice of their Devotions, they have some employment for spending their time
profitably for themselves, or others, and be observant of the laws of the
place, and the Injunctions of their Governors there: in whose power it may be
to eject the disorderly.

4. Erecting Hospitals for the sick; Or among these, for the Incurable: For the
decrepit, lame, blind: For the distracted; For poor children, orphans, or
abandoned, or not maintainable by their poor Parents; These to be taught to
write and read, and their Catechism, and afterward to be bound apprentices; Or
those of better parts and more capable of learning to be maintained in the
University, and fitted for the Clergy. For poor Girls, after their education to
be provided of a Dowry for their Marriage. For poor women with Child in order
to their decent lying in and delivery. For Widows. For Wives ill married,
forsaken, and undone. For Infants exposed etc.

5. Endowing Religious single-persons, for visiting the sick, poor, imprisoned,
and relieving their wants; for attending Hospitals. Women, for teaching
Children gratis to read.

6. Setting up Monte-Pios; Banks of Money to be lent out to poor Tradesmen or
others, with pawns, or other securities given, that the Stock be not lost.

7. Employing the Idle, in setting up Manufactures, and working-houses for them.

8. Putting forth Children to honest Trades, and binding them Apprentices.

9. Paying Dowries for poor maids marriageable; especially those more comely or
beautiful; and so providing for their Chastity.

10. Translating, printing, publishing, and bestowing on the necessitous, Books
of more singular Piety, and Devotion.

Digr. 1. Of the great benefit, as the advancing and improving of Charity in
any of the Kinds forementioned; of Sodalities or Confraternities of pious and
devout persons, Clergy or Laics, and especially, of those that have a nearer
relation and correspondence with one another, in being of the same Office,
Trade, or Profession. Which association may many ways more promote the foresaid
pious design, than single persons can, by making a greater stock of
Charitymonies; by having many eyes to see, and hands to relieve, the
necessitous; by inviting and encouraging and countenancing one another in such
acts of Mercy; and attracting those, who are led by example more than their own
choice and affection thereto. By having meetings at certain times for
consulting about such affairs, wherein the prudence of a few may be serviceable
to the whole; and electing out of their number certain persons more intelligent
and fit and disengaged for the distribution of their Alms: Such a Body being
also more obvious for the distressed their making known their. wants; and more
secure to whose care and overseeing the charitable may commit and leave their
benefactions.

Of the like Sodalities of Ladies and Gentlewomen, usually the more
compassionate and tenderhearted Sex; And the Graces and Virtues of a few thus
diffusing themselves and alluring many others into the same charitable
engagements.

Of Confraternities in several Trades for relieving the necessities of those of
the same company; who, through many Crosses, happen to be decayed in their
Estates.

Digr. 2. Of the many opportunities, that Divines, Physicians and Lawyers more
especially have for helping and assisting their poor Neighbors as to their
Souls, Bodies and Estates. The first, in catechizing the ignorant, visiting and
comforting the sick, or imprisoned, especially when near their end; instructing
them, administering to them the Sacraments, and preparing them for a good
departure out of this world. The second, in gratis affording them his advice
and remedies for their Diseases, and especially making known to them the state
of their sickness, if dangerous or hopeless for their better preparation for
death. The third; in affording his Patronage to, and gratis pleading and
defending their cause, when just; and when it otherwise, dissuading them from
contention: and in arbitrating differences among Neighbors, and preventing
Suits and expenses at Law.

And that these Professions are much recommendable to the Nobility and Gentry
not in order to gain, but to such deeds of Charity.

Digr. 3. Of the nobleness of Charities done not only to the present, but
future Generations, and (perhaps) lasting to the end of the world.

Digr. 4. Of the great power with God of all good deeds done to our Neighbor
(whether it be in our remitting their trespasses, or relieving their
necessities.) And of the special promises made to these Duties in the
Scriptures (God making our goodness a rule unto his; and doing unto us at the
same time, as we do, or wish unto, them): Promises of;

1. Remission of our Sins. 2. Deliverance from Evils; as from Sickness, Want,
Enemies, etc. 3. Temporal happiness: to us; to our seed; (Amongst other
Benefits, the Alms given of some portion of God's gifts sanctifying to us the
use of the rest, Luke 11.41.) 4. Life Eternal.
Digr. 5. Contrary. Of God's showing no mercy to those, who show no mercy to
others.

Digr. 6. Of the unacceptableness with God, and inutility of the good deeds of
those, who do not purify themselves from the continuance in any mortal sin.

. 75.
3. To God.
III. DVTIES to God.

1. Honoring, and loving, Him above all things; and doing every thing you do
for his glory, and to please Him.

1. Honoring and loving Him above all things.
2. Exciting this Divine passion of Love toward God the Father, and our
Savior, especially by the frequent contemplation of his perfections, beauty,
wisdom, goodness, love, and mercy to you, and that in as many particulars as
you can remember.

Digr. 1. Of the beneficial alternation of the Acts of Fear, and Love, to be
prevalent in us according to the often change of our present condition; which
is variously affected toward God; and now terrified by his justice; now
caressed by his mercies. (2. Cor. 5.11. Heb. 12.28. Phil. 2.12.)

3. Never speaking of, or naming him, but in serious matters, with great
reverence: ( Ecclesiasticus 23.9.) and retaining still a spiritual bashfulness,
and modesty, toward the heavenly Majesty.

4. Reading, hearing, (whether this in public, or in private, discourse)
reciting, his Word, with a special devotion, and affection.

5. Doing all your things (as much as you can) only for his glory; and this
with the more readiness when things seem in any opposition to any your temporal
good (for this is thank-worthy): Or, when they are not; yet then having no
regard (as much as you can) to your own temporal benefit: Else, other ends of
your own, being joined with that of his glory, are commonly (tho unobserved) by
us preferred before it; and such means are oftener chosen, that conduce more to
this, than to that: tho this foolishly; for, whilst we look only after God's
good, he takes so much more care (and this surely more effectual) to ours.

6. Doing (which necessarily follows from the former), of many things, that
which still tends to his greater glory, whilst you endeavor to make all
things, besides his glory, indifferent to you.

7. Renewing an actual intention of his glory before every particular action
(else, notwithstanding a general devotement of all your works to him at the
beginning of the day, nature will frequently relapse to minding her own good):
which actual intention will help us to undertake still greater things for his
glory; and to desert all those actions, which serve not, or less, unto it.

8. Procuring his praise from others; in showing, or proclaiming, any part of
his wisdom, or his works; and in accustoming your self to attribute constantly
all good things, and that in the smallest as well as greater matters, unto him
(since he certainly does all good). And especially (since, in this his daily
working all good, in and by us, many yet do rob him of his due glory, to get
some to themselves) taking heed (in your doing any thing commended) to procure
his praise always, rather than your own; and, when any applause comes to you,
presently, to offer it up to him; remembering how Herod was stricken, for not
giving God the glory the people gave to him. Acts. 12.23.

9. Procuring his outward, and visible glory, in reverently observing,
celebrating, adorning, things amongst us, that have more special relation, and
dedication unto him; (as places, times, persons, holy,) and the public service
of him, in and by them; for all these things excessive love naturally does.

10. Often comparing the acts of your love to him, with those of his love to
you; and the meanness of your service, with the greatness of your Lord;
comparing his perfections, and your defects. Considering what a thing any man
is to Angels; what Angels to him; what you amongst those multitudes of worthies
amongst men, on whom he may place his love; and then concluding with St.
Austine: Quid tibi sum ipse, ut amari te jubeas a me; and nisi faciam,
irascaris mihi?

. 76.
II. Believing and Hoping in him.
II. 1. Believing, and hoping, in Him, In all purposes honest (though temporal,
and those of small consequence); But especially, in spiritual; whether
concerning God; your Self, or your Neighbor. (See Ps. 37.3.5.7. -- 55.22. --
9, 10. -- 27.14.) Where you have no private secular interest, and purity of
conscience; And in matters, of greater difficulty; and where, as there is great
reason to undertake, so little humane likelihood to effect, them: For to hope
in him, where affairs are prosperous, and where there is another hope besides,
is also the worldlings hope. ( Job. 13.15. Ps. 27.3.)

Digr. 1. Some degree of want of Faith, the chief obstruction of all good, and
heroical, resolutions.

. 77.
III. Wershipping him.
III. 2. Worshipping him. First with Prayer. In which 1. For our selves.

1. Confession of Sins.

1. With Prayer. 1. Confession
1. Meditating on hell, the punishment thereof; and imploring pordon.

2. Making your Confession of Sins very particular; and not such, and so
general, as the most righteous person in the world may truly say it after you.
Canfessing more specially your last sins after more promises of reformation.
The sins of the present day. Some former greater sins of your life, that more
burden your conscience (which ought continually to be remembered before the
Lord, Psalm. 51.3.) Not only known sins forsaken, but all those actions in which
for the present by some excess or other vicious circumstances you doubt,
whether you may not have offended him, desiring his further illumination, and
remembering Eccl. 9.1. and 1. Cor. 4.4. and professing a ready mind to alter
what in them you shall know to be displeasing unto him.

3. Begging grace of God, to know all your sins, and defects; that you may
remove out of his sight whatever offends him.

4. Using several ways of helping to call them to mind. By running over and
examining 1. The Ten Commandments. 2. The Apostles Catalogue of Sins ( Gal.
5.19. Romans 1.29. Rev. 21.8 etc.) 3. The three faculties of the Soul: Memory;
Understanding, Will and Affections. 4. The five Senses, and the Tongue. 5. The
three ways of sinning, thought, word, deed. 6. Against God, our Neighbor, our
selves.

By reviewing the whole course of our life; (according to, the time (year after
year); places of our abode; Societies, we lived in; employments, we have
followed. etc.

5. Staying our meditation longer on those heads, which have been more
transgressed by us.

6. Reviewing at certain times the greater sins of our former life written
down, and afflicting our Souls for them.

Digr. Of the benefit of the often remembrance, and re- confession of old sins.

. 78.
2. Thanksgiving.
2. Thanksgiving and Confession of God's mercies. 1. Meditating on paradise,
the purchase of Christ's merits for those who serve him, and giving thanks.

2. Imagining all God's, and our Saviors, benefits, as particularly done for
you; Or, considering them to you, comparatively to many others, who enjoy a
less portion of them; or perhaps suffer things contrary unto them.

3. Considering our Lord not only as man, but as God, in all things he did, and
suffered, for you. which will make them still greater unto you, as his person
is; and will produce great reverence, adoration, fear, love, admiration, and
praise, in you.

4. Dedicating some of his benefits still to his service in giving something to
his poor, or using some other acts of Charity. Especially after any
extraordinary favor received (2. Sam. 24.24.)

Digr. Of the horrible crime of Sacrilege, or robbing God of that which others
have given unto him.

. 79.
3 Petition.
3. Petition. Confessing to him 1. your necessities, and wants, spiritual, and
temporal; your infirmities, and present condition, for every thing; (even as if
he knew them not, except from your relation; but indeed, that you may the
better know them, and may become affected accordingly, Psalm. 142.2. Jer. 11.20.
-- 2. King. 19.14.) and so imploring his grace, speedy assistance, succor, etc.

2. In these requests, remembering, and repeating unto our Lord his own words,
his promises, his life he led here etc; as if he had forgot them; but indeed to
strengthen more your faith, in them, and adherence unto him. Thus Nazianzen (
Orat. 11.) describes the earnest devotion of his sick Sister. Gorgonia. -- Ad
altar cum fide procumbit; eumque qui super ipso honoratur, cum ingenti clamore
invocat, omnibusque nominibus appellat, atque omnia ea, quae unquam mirifice
gesserat, velut in memoriam ei revocat etc.

3. Beseeching him as for external necessities, so for your internal; for the
good motions of our Soul (which seem most in our own power, but, in which,
indeed, we no less depend on his help, 2. Cor. 3.5.) for giving us affections
suting to our present duty, joy, sorrow, tears, etc; praying against our will,
to be made willing; and to wish, first, that we may will: Imagining our
understanding, as that of a natural fool's, and every moment receiving new
light (as we beg it) from him.

Digr. That the abilities of the understanding, and will to any good, are
infused from God; and bestowed, upon Prayer.

4. Sanctifying the use of every creature to you, by Prayer, and by the
imploring of his benediction.

5. Observing, in all temporal Petitions, much moderation, and indifferency.

. 80.
4. Praise.
4. 1. Praise and Confession unto him (abstracted from our own particular
obligations and relations to him) of his excellencies.

2. Contemplating, praising, glorifying, admiring, the infinite treasures of
his purest holiness, wisdom, goodness, and the rest of his attributes, and
benefits general to all his Creatures; Mankind; Christians, and his Church.

3. Yielding a distinct Doxology to God the Father: to the Lord Jesus; To the
Holy Spirit; running over their several benefits, and offices.

4. Giving (always) this part of Praise, and Thanksgiving a due share in your
devotions. Knowing, that God is much more delighted in our praising, than in
our praying unto, him; this being done for his glory, the other for our
benefit. And that you have many more blessings (considering your unworthiness)
for which to praise, and thank, him; than wants, (not considering your lusts)
for which to petition him. And that careless thanksgivings make successless
requests. Lastly knowing, that this part of your devotions especially conduces
to the begetting, and nourishing the love of God ( i. e. the utmost top of
man's perfection) in you.

. 81.
5. Acts of love, aspirations; oblations; union; etc.
5. Resolutions of serving him better in those duties, wherein you find in your
self the most, and the last, defects; and Resignation, Consecration, devotement
of your self, and all yours eternally to his service: and the making an
oblation to him, of all your ( i. e. his) gifts, Christian acts, or sufferings;
of your Savior, and his sufferings, and merits performed for you; uniting, and
annihilating your self wholly into his will; rejoicing wholly in him; and in
the joys to come with him.

. 82.
6. Intercession.
1. For others.

6. 1. Intercession, Thanksgiving etc. ( Ps. 119.136.139.158. -- 35.13. -- 2.
Cor. 1.11.) Especially for our fellow members, the Saints. Act. 12.5.12.

2. Intercession in public Prayers, is the more effectually, and also the more
zealously performed if it be not only general, but particular 2. Tim. 1.3.
namely for such a person, friend, family; applying the General intercessions in
such public Prayers unto them.

3. Using intercessions for others, not only in a short remembrance, but in the
same length, and importunity, and form of prayers, as we use for our selves. In
them either changing [me] into [us] intending, and including such a one
particularly, together with your self; or changing [me] into [him] praying for
him singly: Either by saying the Lord's Prayer for him, or any other. As --
forgive him his trespasses -- Lead him not into temptation etc; And it is a
singular Charity not to desist from such Intercessions (tho these unasked) so
long as we know such person has need of them. Jam. 5.16.

Digr. 1. Of the benefit of other men's prayers for us; and that they are very
much to be desired. Even those of inferiors: -- Especially those of Saints; and
those, of the poor; who are in many respects nearer allied to God.

Digr. 2. Of God's hearing the Prayers of some other men (more holy) for us,
when he will not hear our own; and his directing sinners sometimes to procure
some others to pray for them, that he may grant their requests. Genesis 24.7.17.
Job. 42.8, 9.

Digr. 3. Of God's frequently blessing sinners for other men's sakes, who are
righteous.

Digr. 4. Of the benefit of intercession to the Interceders. Besides God's
returning our good wishes for others upon our selves ( Matt. 10, 11.13. Psalm.
30.13.) This mentioning of them, and their necessities before God, rendering us
also more tenderhearted, and ready to help them: for, with what face can we
beg of God to be good to them, when we can, and do refuse to be so our selves.

The Benefits of Prayer.

. 84.
The benefits of Prayer.
1. The great power of Prayer with God (and the rich promises made to it in
Scriptures) even in temporal requests, and these the smallest.

1. The great power of prayer with God.
1. God's Spirit, especially, assisting Us in Prayer.

2. God's extraordinary favors, illuminations, visitations, usually either in,
or presently upon, the time of Prayer.

3. The fruit, and effect of Prayer many times, not sudden, but after many
days, and long petitioning. Eccl. 11.1. Jer. 42.4.7. Act. 12.5.6. where the
Church's Prayers not answered till the night before St. Peter's execution 1.
Pet. 5.6. Eccl. 7.8. And St. Monica's Prayers for her Son St. Austine were not
answered, till, first, many years spent in them. Not happening, that way, or by
that means, we expect it. And often hapening with great intertextures, and
artifices of second causes, which hide to the inobservant the agency of the
first: Tho in which the less his power and force appears, the more does
appear his divine, and wonderful, and secret, contrivance, and wisdom.

4. Upon the requests of your prayers coming to pass, by the agency of second
and ordinary causes, taking heed of conceiting these rewards of Prayers to be
the effects of the ordinary Providence; and of translating your thanks, from
God, upon his instruments; and, unless he work singly, of thinking he works
not at all. But especially acknowledging his more immediate hand in four cases:
1. When his visitations and answers (tho by second causes) happen upon the
instant of your Prayers. 2. Or, in the very point, and exigent of your
necessity. 3. When you find (beyond your expectation) an extreme facility in
the prosecution of your desires. 4. Or, a continual victory in the midst of
many difficulties, and oppositions. It Is a safe error (if any dares call it so)
in attaining things (known certainly to be good) to impute too much rather than
too little to God's hand in it: by which you give him the more praise; and, in
gratitude, bring forth more obedience.

5. Upon the requests of your prayers (and those long, and earnest)
successless, taking heed especially then of the surrepency of some degree of
unbelief. As; the imagining, that God hears not, minds not, Prayers, (or not
yours, a Sinner); or that he has made over all our affairs to the contrivance
of humane wisdom, and the ordinary course of second causes, etc. But most
assuredly assuring your self, that his Majesty himself has heard, and also
has rejected, your request in this, either because he intends to give it you
better in some other way; or because it is some way hurtful, and inconvenient
for you: or because you are yet unworthy (offending him) to receive it: or
because, he has absolutely otherwise decreed to dispose of things; and this is
one of those his purposes, wherein he is not to be swayed by Prayer, (as
especially, for not sending temporal crosses here to those, whom he means to
glorify hereafter): therefore we find some requests denied even to the greatest
Saints, tho importunately begging them; To Moses, Deuteronomy. 3.24. David, 2. Sam.
12.16. Jeremy, Chapter 7.16. St. Paul, 2. Cor. 12.8. Our Savior himself. Matt.
26.39. And therefore St. John limits God's grants to things asked first
according to his will 1. John 5.14. Which will also our Savior interposeth
Matt. 26.42; and the Spirit also has a regard to Romans 8.27. But, the longer
God denies you in any thing that after well examined seems to you necessary,
the more do you humble, and reform, your self, and continue to ask him.

6. Signs that God does or will hear us. Great confifidence in making our
Prayer. Great quiet, and consolation of mind, and courage to attempt a thing;
Or strong hope to receive it rising in us upon, and after, prayer.

7. The ordinary conditions that Prayer may be effectual.

. 85.
The ordinary conditions, that it may be effectual. A strong faith and
Confidence in God, etc.
1. Faith, and Confidence, not only that God can ( Mat. 9.2.) but will, perform
our request; will, if there be no defect on our part, and the request be for
our good; but this our good considered together with the greater advancement of
God's glory, (which thing since we cannot certainly know, neither may our
persuasion of receiving our petitions be absolute; else our persuasion will
sometimes be false. See 2. Cor. 12.8, 9. Where the Apostle, not destitute of
this faith, yet received a Denial, See 2. Sam. 12.16.22. Matt. 26.39.) And such
confidence we should have especially, where humane hopes fail, and we have
nothing else, besides God, whereon to rely, (See 2. Chron. 16.8. Matt. 9.22.28.
Mark. 11, 24. -- 9.23. Act. 14.9. -- 3, 4. Matt. 15.28. -- 19.26. --
13.58.14.30, 31. -- 21.21. Mark. 6.5. -- 9.23. -- 1. Tim. 2.8.) This faith
being required, and rewarded, by God, because it is a great giving of glory to
him; both to his power, as we believing him able; and to his goodness,
merciful; and to his truth, and promises, faithful.

2. Much patience, importunity, and perseverance in our devotions, (the
continuing of Prayer still rendering the Soul more and more capable of what it
petitions for) and constant dependence on God, and waiting for an answer ( Ps.
27.7.14.); and, in using means and prayer, reliance on prayer, not the means.

8. Concerning the grounds of Confidence.

. 86.
1. In respect of the Person prayed to; God.

1. The believing His particular providence over all affairs, and continual
agency in sustaining them. The alike easiness, and faisibility of all things
unto him; and the granting of our requests no more trouble, or difficulty, to
him, than the denial. His extraordinary working many times contrary to the
course of natural causes, and inclinations of free Agents, for the sake of
men's Prayers.

. 87.
Digr. 1. Of miracles, not ceased: tho, from the decay of holiness in general,
and particularly, of great mortification and frequent devotions, they are much
rarer than formerly; And (since a strong faith, and confidence in God's power,
and goodness is required on our parts to the doing of them) in some places the
opinion that they are ceased (which is opposite to such a faith) is a great
cause that they are ceased.

Digr. 2. And these done all by Jesus Christ. And usually by the instrumency of
his Saints, or Angels; which Angels if there were not a particular providence
(upon the Saints prayers and necessities) controling sometimes the common
course of Nature, and some things executed here by these other agents,
different from it, why are they said to be ministering Spirits, sent forth for
to minister to the heirs of Salvation? ( Heb. 1.14.)

Digr. 3. Of a special Faith, with respect to the effect, ordinarily required
to render us capable of receiving any miraculous or supernatural effect
(perhaps that faith; viz. for receiving miraculous favors named 1. Cor. 12.9.
the faith of doing miracles being set down verse 10.) which faith though it
seems to be a more extraordinary gift of the spirit; yet as all other gifts (1.
Cor. 12.31. -- 14.1.) it is to be requested, and to be pursued, and fortified,
with our endeavors; the concurrence of which (in a manner we know not) God
requires to his graces (See Mark. 11.24. Matt. 21, 22. -- 1. Tim. 6.8. etc.)
else the exhortations, unto it, were vain; the reprehensions, for the defect
thereof, causeless.

Digr. 4. Of the Faith of one (in respect of these miraculous effects) very
beneficial to another; as, of Parents for their Children, or one Relation for
another (See Matt. 8.8, 13. Jo. 4.50. Mark. 2.4, 5. Matt. 15.28. Jam. 5.15.)
those who are to receive such favor at least non ponentibus obicem by strong
acts of unbelief.

. 88.
2. In respect of the Person praying.

1. His living an holy, and sanctified life, (God not hearing the Prayers of
Sinners: Quae spes est, nisi de aliqua conscientiae bonitate? Sinners (i. e.)
such, as remain still unreformed, and do not as yet address themselves to the
works of repentance.) Especially his abounding in works of mercy (God chiefly
to such returning all mercy.)

2. In his praying exercising a great humility, (and this perhaps expressed by
some mortification: See this done by Kings, 2. Sam 7.16. -- 1. King. 21.27. --
2. King. 6.30. -- 19.1.) and sense of his own unworthiness of any of God's
favors; casting himself wholly upon his bounty, and the many promises made of
harkening especially to the poor in spirit (See Dan. 9.18.7, 8, 9. Jam. 4.6
com. 5. Esaias 66.2. comp. 3. Psalm. 34.17.18. -- 51.7. Esaias. 57.15. Genesis 18.27.
Judge. 6.39. Prove. 28.14.)

3. His diligently calling to mind God's former mercies to him, or to others
like him, for the strengthening of his faith, and hope; according to which God,
many times, works Romans 5.4. Psalm. 116.1, 2. -- 2. Cor. 1.10. Luke 22.35.
Psalm. 78.4.2.43.

4. His expecting all things only through the merits of Jesus Christ; and
asking them in his name.

. 89.
II. The Benefit of the exercise of Prayer upon our selves
1. Making us blush, not to join afterward our endeavors with professed,
unfeigned, and fervent desires; Excellently preparing and softning the Soul for
the receiving any grace. Nay, by a powerful excitement of the Holy Spirit in us
(which also forms our Prayers), working such spiritual graces in Us in the
thinking and contemplation of them; and it self planting those holy
inclinations in the Soul, whilst it passionately sues for them. Every fervent
Prayer to God being also a strong exhortation to our selves; and all earnest
petitioning that we may, being at the same time a consideration, that we ought,
to do such things: and at once both working, and begging: So that he that can
bring himself heartily to pray for any spiritual grace, has begun to possess
it.

Digr. 1. Of the indefatigable practice of this duty by our Lord and by his
Saints: who well perceived the rich fruits thereof.

Digr. 2. Of strengthening and rendering more prevalent with God, in matters of
greater concernment, our Prayers, by adding to them Vows, and Alms-deeds, and
corporal Mortisications.

PART IV. Counsels, and Directions concerning Prayer, Meditation, and other
Exercises, serving for advancement of Piety, and acquiring Christian perfection.
. 90.
1. Concerning Prayer: Concerning Preparatives to Prayer.
1. BEfore your appearing before God in Prayer, clearing your self (as God has
commanded), so far as it is in your power, from your sins toward your
Neighbor; and quitting all his toward you: In satisfaction, either already
performed to him, or seriously promised to God, where injuring; and in
forgiveness, presented likewise then to God, where injured. ( Matt. 5.23, 24.
-- 1. Tim. 2.8. Mark. 11.25. Jam. 3.9, 10.)

2. Performing your devotions, either when fasting, or very temperate, and at
some reasonable distance from your meals; and sometimes also preparing your
self son them by some acts of mortification. Nothing is so opposite to
devotion, and the Spirit, as intemperance, strong drink, and excess in diet
(See Ephesians. 5.18. Act. 10.30, Matt. 17.21. Luke 1.15. Psalm. 35.13. Dan. 10.1, 2.
12. Act. 13.2, 3.)

3. 1 Not coming to them with your mind, and thoughts already tired out, and
spent in other business (which accordingly must needs be less serviceable to
you, in this your greatest duty) and some little time before them (if you can)
deserting other employments. It Is beneficial, before you go to Prayer, to read
something pious; or (if you please) to read some Prayer, before praying; so to
retire your mind, from secular thoughts, and dispose it to Divine.

3. 2 When you go to Prayer, with an hourglass measuring your time; and taking
some Book of Devotion or Saints life, with which you use to be much affected,
to lie by you; and for this also choosing a place of Prayer convenient for light
and reading; and, when sterilities and dullness, or much distraction of
thoughts, assault you, reading so long till something affect you. This has
been the practice of many great Saints. And he who uses this stome, will go
much more cheerfully to this spiritual exercise, and spend longer time in it,
having these Arms about him to repel the ordinary disturbers of it.

4. In the morning performing your Devotions, first; whilst the mind is clear,
and not engaged in other thoughts.

5. In the Evening, last; when the mind has for that day taken her leave of
all other business; and that so your time of Prayer also may not be limited by
them.

6. Since for every day you perform and renew them, applying your Prayers,
Confessions, Petitions, etc. more chiefly to the occurrences of the present day
[as that of our Lord; Give us this day, etc.] which will make, your Requests
(as being for things near at hand) more affectionate; and your endeavors (that
day) in the seconding of your Prayers, and rendering them not frustrate, more
vigilant, and earnest.

7. Using all humble reverence of the Body, Corporal Reverence in Prayer.
etc, where opportunity; yet not confining your self for all the time of Prayer
to any one posture thereof, after it begins to be painful, or tedious (whilst
you retain the same humility, and devotion in all); nor omitting the substance
of the Duty of Prayer, for being hindered perchance of such circumstances.
Freely expressing also, and venting the holy passions of your mind and of the
Spirit, by the exterior indications, and effects thereof; As by sighing;
groaning; weeping; etc.

. 91.
Digr. 1. Of the great impression the behavior of the Body makes upon the
Soul: And that the devotion is much increased by the body's humiliation; and,
the more, if this sometimes varied.

Digr. 2. Of the several postures, and deportments of the body, used by holy
men in the time of Prayer. As, Standing up; -- Prostration, and falling on the
face, and lying on the ground; -- Contemplating the heavens (therefore going up
to the house top to pray); -- Lifting up, casting down, the eyes; -- Lifting
up, spreading forth, the hands; -- Smiting of the breast; -- Bowing down of the
head; -- Bowing, baring, the knee; -- kissing the ground; -- Covering the Body
with sackcloth, or rags; -- Sighing; -- groaning; -- weeping.

. 92.
Guard of the Eyes.
8. In all places, and business, where you would enjoy a greater recollection
of your mind, and thoughts, but especially, in the service, and meditations of
God (public or private) keeping a strict guard over your eyes; which having
liberty to wander, the mind is filled with many fancies and very difficulty
fixed. Custodia Oculorum, Custodia Cordis.

. 93.
Exciting of a suitable. Passion.
9. Striving before hand to excite in your self a passion suting to the
particular act of your devotion: As great sadness, in confession of sin; --
Great humility, and lowliness, and self-abjection, in petitioning; --
Cheerfulness, and joy, in thanking, and praising; -- The passion of love, in
oblation, and resignation, etc. -- Compassion, in Intercession: And observe,
that our intention much helps the production of such passion, by the lively
presentation of such an object to our mind as ( viz. Death, Corruption, Hell;
Heaven, Light, Glory, Music, etc.) usually excites it: the affections being
thus subject to the understanding, and the will; as well as, in other respects,
these faculties are to them: -- Praying before to God, to give you such a
passion, whereby you may be helped to do such a duty. Not entertaining, at the
same time of prayer, a contrary passion, though it be very pious; for so
neither can it be so well prosecuted.

. 94.
Imagination of God's presence.
10. In the time of Prayer, Imagining God (or our Savior) not a far off, but
present, by, or within ( Ps. 16.8.) you so speaking, and discoursing with him,
harkening to, and attending upon, him, as one that is present in the innermost
part of your soul, and heart; (as indeed, if our eyes were but opened, (as were
those of Elisha and his Servant) we should see him in all things and in our
selves; and all things and our selves also in him (for these are both one);
compassing us round, as the air, or the light does; and again thoroughly
penetrating all things and us, as the light does the air; or the fire the
glowing iron. Omnia implendo continens, and continendo implens (Austin) and see
our selves, again, moving in him, as fishes, or spunges in the Ocean; or Atoms
in a Sunbeam (See Acts 17.27, 28:) For, if the whole earth be but as a small
point to the Sun, how much less are we to God! But, above all creatures, more
specially we should see him dwelling in the hearts of the faithful (therefore
called his Temple, See 2. Cor. 6.16. -- 1. Cor. 6.17.19.) or see them dwelling
in him, (for, where things are perfectly united, these two expressions are the
same, and promiscuously used: See 1. Jo. 4.13. -- 6.56. Romans 8.10. comp. 2.
Cor. 5.17. -- 1. Cor. 1.30. comp. 2. Cor. 5.21.); See him there speaking to the
Soul, and visiting it with frequent inspirations, the signs of his presence,
and the interior language wherein God speaks to us, and therefore is there to
be attentively hearkened to, by us. ( Luke 17.21. Jo. 16.32. -- 8.29. Heb.
11.27. -- 1. Jo. 14.13, 4.16.) As for those words in the Lords Prayer [which
art in Heaven] they are not mentioned to direct the petitioner to him, as a far
off, but to magnify to such Petitioner, and to mind him of, his Heavenly
Majesty, and that so he may give the following doxologies to him as to the most
High: Hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdom come, etc.

Or, if you conceive of God, as of something without you, and at a distance,
Imagining, that you see him (then specially when you are in Prayer) looking
down from heaven, and casting his eye upon you; As the Sun whilst it shines
upon the whole Hemisphere, yet seems to every place therein to shine only upon
it.

Again; imagining, that you see our glorious Savior, there where he now sits,
graciously beholding you from thence, (for so he does), as he beheld Stephen,
to encourage him; or Paul, to convert him. Or that you see him by, or before,
you, in some of those postures others beheld, and conversed with him, in the
time of his life here on Earth.

11. 1 This imagination of God's presence (which is to be strengthened by
custom) and the often (not acknowledging only, but) seriously thinking, and
meditating on it, and inciting your self continually to remember it, will much
increase your reverence toward Him; and hinder the wandering of your thoughts:
will strengthen your faith and confidence that he sees, and takes notice of
all your desires, and that your Prayers are still heard, and considered, by
him; and (from this his intimacy, and inhabitation) will make your discourse
more free, and particular, in the communicating of all your insirmities, wants,
desires, purposes, resolutions, etc. unto him, and also more frequent, and
oftener, with him: will more comfort your solitude, or afflictions; will much
more move your affections, apprehending so near a Majesty (as also his visible
presence would much more than this): Lastly, will help much to recollect and
retire your faculties from external objects; which suffer more evagation when
they speak to him, (who is every where, and therefore within us) as abroad, or
a far off; Il recordarmi, che ho compania dentro di me, e di Gran Giovamento,
said a great Saint. Came. di Perf. 29. c. And such meditation is recommended as
a most advantageous way to attain perfection. See more of this below n. 15.

11. 2 To strengthen this Meditation in you the more (which is of so great
consequence) often meditating on Psalm. 139. Prove. 15.3.11. Job. 26.6. Psalm.
23.4. Rev. 3.20. Gal. 2.20. Heb. 11.27. -- 2. Cor. 13.3. Jo. 14.21.23. Act.

Recollection of Mind and Senses in Prayer.
12. In your prayers diligently opposing, and with much resolution striving
against, any distractions, and extravagations of your mind and thoughts (which
by custom will become obedient, and fixed) for this will render your prayers,
as more effectual, and beneficial, so more grateful, sweet, and easy unto you:
the time of them being more tedious, as the mind is less united ( Psalm. 86.11.)

13. Suspending in time of Prayer (as much as may be) all action of the
exterior faculties, and retiring the Soul, and Spirits, as it were from all
parts to the center of your heart, there to transact your affairs with your
Maker. In which motions of the heart, to produce a greater fervor, some have
used the retention or suspension to some degree of respiration; a thing usually
happening in sighing, weeping, and any great passion of mind. Such recollection
of Spirits (because vis unita fortior) will much heighten, and inflame devout
affections in you; and these again much advance your spiritual proficiency.
This at first somewhat difficult, but facilitated by custom.

14. Beneficial for such recollection of our faculties are, solitude and
silence; -- the night. Hence night-devotions so much commended: shutting, out
light, or, the eyes; or at least fixing them; because the presentment of their
objects provokes the action of the senses; especially those of the eyes, which
have their object always before them; and enjoyed at any distance.

. 96.
Heightning and enlargment of the Affections.
15. Much using, and indulging your affections in Prayer, rather than the
fancy; and the operations of Love, rather than the discourse of reason; and
performing this holy exercise in the heart, more than in the brain. (The
intense acts of both which cannot be exercised at once; and it being with these
holy, as with other, passions, the higher they grow in us the less use there is
of reasoning; and they wholly follow their own impetus). Again; the chief
profit of the Soul lying not so much in thinking of God, as in loving him
extremely; nor in advancing of Arguments, as in fervor of Spirit; and in the
attendance, and waiting, and harkening, elevations, adherence, embracings,
aspirings, languishings, expectings, of the Soul, after God: (As our Savior in
the Garden used not many words, but much passion.) It is much better (when God
offers it) for the Soul on this fashion to be carried toward God, rather than
to guide her self; and to suffer, than to work out, her devotions; nec tam ex
se operari, quam suavem Dei operationem pati; and auscultare magis, quam loqui.

. 97.
Upon which to enlarge my self a little more, (this being the chief matter of
that, which they call mystical Theology); you must know, that some persons of
more pure conversation, and more frequent exercise in Prayer, have observed in
themselves, at certain times in their Prayer (especially when long continued,
or after much practiced) some more strong and vigorous influences and
operations of God's spirit upon the soul, and a sense of his extraordinary
presence; wherein the Soul is more passive, and quiescent as it were, and the
Holy Spirit more acting in her. The effect of which divine visits thereof
ordinarily is a much clearer discovery of the beauty, goodness, greatness, and
excellency, of her well-beloved; and so a much greater increase of the ardency
of her love toward him, and further alienation from all other wordly things:
In which visits all the care the Soul takes is, no way to hinder, or by any
divertisement to disturb, or lose, so delightful an entertainment. For howbeit
it is from God; yet it is not (most what) so irresistible, but that one may
possibly (tho with some difficulty) turn away himself from such intrancement to
some other thing: and sometimes, to men eminently holy, is this divine Energy
so violent, and unsupportable to nature (from which great lassitudes, and
weakness of the Body for many days do often follow) that they are forced to
decline, and moderate it, and divert from it. (This will not seem strange to
any one, who has been versed in the lives of Saints, among whose experiences
may be found a great accord in this matter).

. 98.
Now, tho these extraordinary transactions in the Soul, and supernatural
touches of God's Spirit, are not acquirable at all by our industry, so, as to
be sure to possess them; nor no man can have them when, or detain them how
long, he pleases, by any art or means; Yet it is observed by those who have
received them, that ordinarily God conferrs them not, save after some pains
taken by, and dispositions produced in, our selves for the reception of them:
(he acting conformably to our exercises, and pre-inclinations thereto). And so
it has pleased God, that many others, their disciples, having as it were
learned from them so experienced this Art, and been encouraged to undertake the
predisposing assiduity of mental prayer, have also arrived to the same
perfections, and heavenly visits, and entertainments ( Jo. 14.23.) so extremely
beneficial in the future course of their lives. Now, this pre-disposition is
observed chiefly to be effected by operating in our selves (which yet no doubt
is not done without the aid of God's Spirit tho this imperceptible) as near as
we can, something like them.

. 99.
And this is done chiefly by these three. First; By a firm, and accustomed
apprehension of God's (or our Savior's) presence, with, before, or within, us;
presence with, or before, Him; recommended before. 94. and below. 114.
Secondly; By a recollection of our selves, suspension (mentioned above,. 95.)
and silencing (as much as we can) of all actions of our exterior senses,
agitations of the fancy, discourse of the understanding, and, in general, all
work of the brain; by an abstraction (as much as we can) from all things
besides God; not so much by a contest with them thought-on, as by a
forgetfulness of them, or shutting them out of our thoughts; that so by not
using any of our Spirits in the service of our cognoscitive faculties, we may
give more place, and afford more strength, to the Action of the will, and
affections. Now we may know, that the hinderance of those introduces a more
intense Act in these; because we find any vehement exercise of the will, and
affections (naturally) to stop, and intercept the discourse of the Intellect.
Therefore, in the height of her passions (which seems to be a far more intimate
faculty of the Soul, than is the understanding) we find reason to have no
power, or admittance, nor access to the Soul; As it is in intense anger, love,
sorrow, etc. Affecting much, and thinking much, have a kind of opposition: nor
can the heart, and brain, be hot at once; And it is true in divine, as other,
loves: Nemini contingit simul amare, and sapere. I mean for the actual exercise
of the brain, and of prudential notions. Yet note, that the suspension of those
faculties or acts is not so meant here, as to render you wholly idle, or asleep
as it were, in case the affections be not much moved in Prayer; but, that you
ought still to use the help of the intellect, for the raising, and closer
applying, and fanning continually of your affections, in short, and unlaborious
ejaculations (such, as that of St: Francis, Deus meus and omnia -- My God, my
Savior etc. Psalm. 18.1, 2. Psalm. 144.1, 2.) in considering God's presence, and
comforting your self in him, and it, entering into familiar colloquies with him,
making requests to him, using a thousand acts of humility, and vilifyings, and
annihilations of your self before him, so keeping your amative faculties still
in motion, by a many (not forced) industries; provided only, that all those
more laborious, and difficult, and tedious exercises of the brain be here
excluded.

. 100.
Thirdly, In this silence of the other cognoscitive faculties) this is done by
a strong, and vigorous exercise of the will and the affectionate and amative
powers, by making a total introversion into the most intimate part of our Soul,
or Heart, to enjoy God there; and directing, as it were, all our thoughts, and
retiring our Spirits, thither-ward, and there practicing the love, suspirings,
etc. abovementioned (See Ephesians. 3.17, 18. -- 1. Jo. 4.16.) And here it is
observed; that howbeit (at the first) neither this suspension of discourse, and
abstractions from by-thoughts, nor the uniting of our affections to God are
obtainable without some pain, and difficulty; yet, after some practice, and
accustoming thereto, such a habit, and facility therein is acquired, That the
former, viz. our busy thoughts, and discourse will need no great charming, but
upon our beck be silent, and all such advertisements depart from us: the later
likewise, the affections, need little, or no exciting, but an ardent love
(having been once accustomed to it) transports us toward the embraces of God,
even in the beginnings also of our Prayers, or also upon any light mention of
God, or heavenly things: Only whilst many, from this painfulness at first
(wherein the Soul is hardly kept from extravagancy, and restrained from her
liberty of thinking) are disheartened from a patient perseverance in such
practice: therefore it is conceived that so few reap the happy fruit thereof.
And these three; 1 The strong apprehension of God's intimate presence to us. 2
The silencing of the discursive; And 3 enlarging of the affectionate, and
amative faculties toward God, our Sovereign, our only good, are the whole
content (as I conceive) of that they call mystical Theology; for as much as
concerns our own work, tho in the expressions hereof Authors much vary.

. 101.
I will recommend to you the reading, on this subject, of the fourth, eighth,
and thirteenth Chapters of St. Teresa's Life: And the 25, 26.28. and 29. Chap
of her Way of Perfection; who was a head Scholar in this School of Prayer; and
saw frequent experience of the effect of these directions, when well observed,
having taught many others this heavenly art; who also, by practicing the same
lessons failed not to attain it. Howbeit, were these practices, as to such
extraordinary communications of God's Spirit, profitless, yet can they not in
themselves be any way not very commendable; unless to love God, or neglect the
world extraordinarily be a fault.

. 102.
Concerning the apprehension of God's more intimate presence, and recollection
of the Soul from all other objects, you may find this Holy Mother ( Way of
Perfection, cap. 28.) instructing, and encouraging her spiritual daughters on
this manner (She Commenting there on the Lord's Prayer.)

Now weigh well this, which your Master says: Which art in Heaven. Think ye,
that it little concerns you to know, what thing Heaven is; and, where ye are to
seek for your most Holy Father? I tell you then; that, for wandering Intellects,
it much imports them, not only to believe this [Article] but to procure to
understand it by experience. For it is one of those things, which strongly
binds up the understanding, and causes the Soul's recollection of it self.

You already know; That God is in every place; and it is clear also; where the
King is, there is his Court: In sum, that where God is, there Heaven also is,
and all Glory: this without doubt may easily be believed by you. Consider what
St. Austine said: That he went into many places seeking for God, and that he
came at length to find him within himself. Neither needs the Soul any wings to
fly with to seek him out; but only to put her self into a posture of solitude,
and retiredness, and to behold him within her self; and not to leave so great a
Guest, but with great humility bespeak him, as a Father; recount to him her
calamities, and beg of him the remedy thereof; acknowledging she is unworthy to
be his daughter.

Treat ye with him as with a Father, with a Brother with a Lord, and with a
Spouse; sometimes in one manner, sometimes in another; for he will teach you,
what you must do to please him. Observe, that it concerns you much, to
understand this truth, that God abides within you, and that there we may abide
with him. This way of praying, although it be vocally, with much more speed
recollects the understanding, and is a way of Prayer, that brings with it many
good things, being styled of Recollection. [This she supposes to be in our
power by our endeavors to attain to.] Because the Soul in it recollects all
her faculties, and enters within her self with her God, and there her Divine
Master comes, to instruct, and teach her, in a much briefer manner, than it is
in other ways, and to bestow upon her the Prayer of rest: [This is the lowest
sort of Prayer, which she calls supernatural, and not in our power to
acquire.] Because, thus retired, she may here with her self meditate on the
passion, and here represent the Son [as Crucified] and offer him to the Father;
and not weary the understanding, in going forth to seek him on Mount Calvary,
or in the Garden, or at the Pillar. Those, who in this manner can lock in
themselves in this little Heaven of our Soul, where abides he that created both
the Heaven, and the Earth; and shall inure themselves, not to behold, nor stay,
where the exterior senses distract them, let them believe, that they walk in an
excellent way; and that they shall not fail at last to arrive to drink water
from the fountain. In this recollection the Soul retires the exercise of its
faculties from these exterior things, and in such a manner abhors them, that
(tho unawares) she shuts the bodily eyes not to behold them, that so those of
the Soul may see so much better. Accordingly, who walks by this way, almost
always in Prayer keeps his eyes shut; and it is an admirable custom for many
things, because it is as it were a forcing ones self not to observe these
things below. This (shutting the eyes) happens only in the beginnings [of such
recollections,] for afterward its needless; since then we must use more force
upon our selves to open them. The Soul at such a time seems to fortify her self
at the bodies charge, [ i. e. in withdrawing from it its Spirits] and leave it
all alone, and much enfeebled, and thence to draw provisions, and maintenance
against it. And although this [power of retiring the faculties] in the
beginning is not perceived, because it is not much, (for in this recollection
there are degrees of more, and less) yet if it be once brought into a custom
(although at the first it causes some trouble, because the body replies, and
disputes the business, not perceiving that it destroys it self in not yielding
to, and suffering such a conquest) if, I say, this for some days be used, and
we force our selves to it, the gain thereof will be manifest; and we shall
afterward perceive, that, in the beginning of Prayer, the Bees will presently
repair to their Hive, and enter there-into to make Honey, and that without any
diligence or trouble of ours: because so it has pleased God, that, by that
former time of forcing our selves, the Soul, and the Will, has merited to be
endowed with such a command, as that, in only intimating to them, and no more,
that she would withdraw them, the faculties obey her, and retire unto her. And
although, after a while, they return to go forth again, yet much is gained,
that thus they have been retired, because they now go abroad only as slaves,
and subjects, nor do that mischief (in it) as formerly; and, when the Will
again recalls them, they come with more readiness; till, after many of these
Re-entrances of the Soul into it self, it at length please the Lord, that they
should fix there altogether in a contemplation more perfect.

. 103.
And this, which I have said, although it appear obscure, yet who will put it
in practice, shall easily understand it etc. And, since it so much concerns us
not to go on [in our Devotions] slowly, let us discourse a little how we may
inure our selves to so good a way of proceeding in them. Let us therefore make
account, that within us there stands a Palace of most rich workmanship, its
Edifice consisting all of Gold, and precious Stones, in fine every way such as
is suting to so great a Lord; and that you are in part the cause, that this
Edifice is such, as indeed it is; (for there is no Fabric at all of so great
beauty as a Soul pure, and replenished with virtues, which by how much greater
they are, so much greater is the luster of those precious Stones;) and that in
this Palace lodges that great King, who is pleased to make himself your guest;
and that he is there seated in a Throne of the greatest value, which is your
Heart. This will seem at the first to you but a thing impertinent, that I
should make such a fiction, to make you understand it; yet it may help much you
especially etc. Again, Chapter 29th; She proceeds thus on the same subject. The
Soul's entering within her self into this Paradise together with her God, and
locking the door after her against all things, which are in the world. Ye may
know, that it is not at all a thing supernatural; but, that it depends on our
Will, and that we are able to do it, with that help of God, without which we
are able to do nothing at all, not so much as to have of our selves one only
good thought. For this is not a silence of the faculties, but a shutting them
up within themselves.

. 104.
Many ways we go on in acquiring it, both by dis-busying our selves from all
other things, that we may interiourly thus join our selves unto God, and, in
business also, by retiring sometimes into our selves, tho it be but for a
moment. This remembering my self, that I have such a companion within me, is of
great help; and that which I only aim at, is, that we procure to stand with
him, (whom we are speaking to) without turning our backs upon him: for, no
other thing [than turning our backs] seems it to me, to stand in discourse with
God, and be thinking on many vanities. All the damage comes, from not
understanding, that most truly he stands near us, and not a far off from us.
But, how far is he from us, if we go to seek him in Heaven? The Lord teach this
to those of you, who do not know it. I confess for my self, that I never knew
what it was to pray with any affection, until the Lord taught me this way. And
I have always found so much benefit of this Custom, and manner of recollection
within my self, that, for that reason, I have here so long stood upon it.

. 105.
I conclude: He, who would attain this profitable way of recollection,
(because, as I say, with the help of God it lies in our own power) let him not
be weary to practice himself in what is here spoken; because it is by little
and little the getting the Mastership of himself: he not (thus) losing his
liberty in vain, but rather gaining himself wholly to himself; that is, the
having his faculties at command for interior matters. If he will speak, he must
procure to remind himself, that he has one to speak-with within him; if he
hearken, he has to consider, that he ought to hear one, who speaks the most
intimately to him; in sum, to make account, that he may if he will, never
dis-joyn himself from so good company; and to lament himself, when, for any
long time, he has left there alone this his Father, of whom he has always so
great need.

. 106.
If he can do this many times in a day, let him do it; and if not, at least a
few times; because, when he has contracted a custom thereof, he shall find
himself much a gainer thereby, either presently, or within no long time. And,
after our Lord has granted it him, he will not exchange it for any treasure
whatsoever; but nothing is acquired without some pains.

. 107.
For the love of God (my Sisters) count that endeavor well employed, which ye
shall spend in this thing; [she says of her self, that in her first practice
thereof, few days passed, that she made not many hours of Prayer, (but these I
suppose more in affective than discoursive Prayer, assisted with reading in
Sterilities) unless hindered by sickness, or much business; and she advises
others to practice it, at least for two hours every day; in her Life, Chap.
8th.] for I know, that if you shall intend in one year, and perhaps a half,
with the favor of God, ye shall attain it. Behold how small a time, for so
great a gain, as this is, to lay a good foundation, that, if the Lord will
exalt you to greater matters, he may see in you a good disposition, in finding
you so nigh unto him. May his Divine Majesty never permit, that we far-remove
our selves from his most amiable presence! Amen. The same thing much-what is
said, Ibid. chapter 26.

. 108.
To the same purpose she speaks also in the 13th Chapter of her Life. -- Let them
(says she) set themselves in the presence of Christ; and without tiring the
understanding let them be discoursing, and delighting themselves with him, not
wearying themselves in framing reasons, and handsome expressions, but in
simplicity represent their needs, and the reason he has, not to endure them,
before him: One thing at one time, and another thing at another time, to the
end the Soul be not cloyed with feeding always on one Dish. -- When we set our
selves to meditate on some passage of the Passion of Christ our Lord, (as for
Example, of his being bound to the Pillar,) here the Understanding goes
searching out the reasons and ways, whereby it may apprehend the excessive
pains, and torments, that our Lord suffered in that Posture, finding himself
alone, and forsaken of his friends, and many other things, which if the
Understanding be active, or the person learned, may be drawn thence: And thus,
it is good to discourse thereon a while, thinking on the pains he suffered
there, and for whom he suffered them, and who he is that suffered them, and the
love wherewith he suffered them: but withal let not the Soul tire her self by
going continually in quest of such discourse, but stay her self there with
Christ, keeping the Understanding silent. And, if she can, let her employ it in
thinking, that he stands beholding her; let her accompany him, petition him,
abase her self before, and solace her self with, him; and let her remember her
self, that she is unworthy to be there. When she can do this, tho it be in the
beginning of her Prayer, she will find great advantage thereby, and this
[later] kind of Prayer affords many benefits; at least my Soul has found it so.

. 109.
Thus she, in that 13th Chapter; and, if you have now any further curiosity to
know her first 1 beginnings in the practice of this Prayer; 2 after her having
read D' Ossuna's third Abecedary; she describes them before (in the 4th Chapter
of her Life) on this manner. 3 I endeavored (says she) the best I could, to
carry Jesus Christ our Sovereign good, and our Lord, always present within me,
and this was my manner of Prayer. If I meditated on any passage of his Passion
I represented it to my self in my interior, although I spent most of the time in
reading good Books, wherein was all my recreation; for God had not given me the
talent of discoursing with my Understanding, or of helping my self with the
imagination, which in me is so gross, that, when I have set my self to do it, I
could never obtain of it so much, as perfectly to conceive, or represent within
my self the Humanity of our Lord. And, although some, by this way, that they
cannot discourse with the understanding, do sooner attain to contemplation, if
they persevere, yet is it a thing very painful, and of great difficulty;
[especially to those, who are not content with common and obvious matter of
Devotion, i. e. such as a Book, or our memony easily affords, but seek after
subtiler Discourses.] For, if the employment of the will, by having no object
present, where her love may busy it self, happen to fail, the Soul is left as
it were without a stay, and exercise; and her solitude, and aridity do put her
to great pain; and likewise her [wandring] thoughts to a sore encounter. For
persons of this temper it is requisite to have greater purity of conscience,
than those, who can discourse with the Understanding. For, he who can
discourse, What a thing the world is, and how deeply he is obliged to God; The
great pains Christ has suffered for him, and the little service he does his
Majesty, and What reward our Lord gives to him that loves him; draws matter
from thence to defend himself from thoughts, from occasions, and from dangers;
but he, that cannot help himself herewith, is in greater peril; and it is fit,
that he should employ himself much in reading, since of himself he knows not
how to draw out such Arguments. For this manner of proceeding is so painful,
that if the Master, who has the guidance of such a Soul, should restrain it to
exercise Prayer without reading, I say it is impossible, it should continue
therein very long, being so deprived of this help of reading (for reading helps
him much to recollect himself, who proceeds after this sort, and is necessary
for him; tho it be but little, which he reads; and that only in the room of
that mental Prayer, which he cannot make.) Yea also it will much prejudice his
health, if he persist obstinately in such Prayer, for it is a thing too
painful, and toilsome. By this means of using a Book, I began to recollect
these powers of my Soul, and as it were with such enticements alluring on my
Soul, I proceeded in my Prayer. And oftentimes but opening the Book I needed no
more, and sometimes I read little, other times much, according to the favor
that our Lord pleased to do me. Thus she, with great assiduity in Prayer, and,
it seems, not without using much pains and diligence, and suffering of some
aridities at the first in recollecting her faculties, and shutting out
by-thoughts, and removing their occasions, attained afterward to so high, and
frequent unions of her Soul with God and to such a perfection in this holy art
of Prayer, as to become a most famous Pattern therein to all ensuing
Generations. You may find also an eminent proficiency and the like experiences
therein of the Holy Father Balthazar Alvarez, sometimes Confessor to St.
Tereza; as is storied in the 13, 14, 15.40, 41. Chapters of his Life. And the
reason, why there are so few of those, who possess great purity of Conscience,
and Conversation, that attain to the like divine favors, and supernatural
effects of Prayer, seems to be, the not using the same frequency of Prayer, and
the like courageous diligence, and resolute patience in encountering all
difficulties therein at the beginning (See her Life, Cap. 8.) as this great St.
Teresa, and some others, have done.

. 110.
When any thing in Prayer extraordinarily affects you, staying, and spending so
much more of the time allotted for your devotions upon it; causing your reason
to observe, and the set method of your Prayers to yield to (if I may so say)
the lusts of the Spirit; which, if at all other times it causes all good
motions in us, certainly operates them more especially in Prayer; (See Romans
8.26.) and doubtless hence will arise as more content, so more profit to the
Soul. Here then the longer you fix in any one point of Prayer, the brieflier
running over the rest.

. 111.
17. There are two acts of Prayer; Meditation, and Contemplation; One the
discoursive part thereof, performed more by the Understanding, and used more in
the beginning of Prayer; the other the more enjoying, and passionative part,
performed chiefly by the will; and happening more in the end of Prayer; at
least to those not much practiced. Of these the second ordinarily is produced
by the first; the working of the brain by degrees kindling passions in the
heart; and long meditation of God, and his perfections etc, enflaming our
affections toward him; and the Holy Spirit operateth in both: in one, by
illumination; and, in the other, by love; but more chiefly in the second.
Sometimes the vehement inclinations of the will (by a more immediate power of
grace) preceding the acts of the Understanding, and forcing it to follow them;
but more commonly the intellect, by reasoning, exciting the will, and the
passions. You therefore here are to use the forenamed acts of the Soul
interchangeably: only the first yielding to the second, as it grows to any
strength; but then, when the second languisheth, it is to be excited again by
the first: for we are neither to think we pray best, when we think of nothing
at all, nor when we are most full of loquacity. For, the brain being wholly
idle, the affections go out for want of fuel; nor is there any operation of the
passions without some using (at the same time) of the imagination. And again,
the affections not operating, the speculations of the intellect are fruitless,
and comfortless. But, if at the first also the understanding happen to be dull,
sluggish, and unoperative, as is usual to new beginners, and to the same
persons at some times much more than at others, you are to excite both it, and
the affections by reading some select book of devotion (taken with you to
Prayer) till you find your self able, without its help, to proceed. Teresa (in
the 4th Chapter of her Life) reports of her self, that for eighteen years she
never durst betake her self to mental Prayer without a Book in her hand, that
she might still repair to reading, in case of any distraction from impertinent
thoughts, or aridity, and barrenness of Soul.

. 112.
Digr. 1. Of the great effects which the affections, thus enflamed in Prayer
with the love of God etc, work in the Soul, and the influence they have
afterward upon its actions; causing in it a greater vilifying of the world, and
abhorrence of all sin and displeasing God, and of tepidity in his service; and
raising a love to mortifications, and sufferings; freeing it from melancholy,
for the absence of some worldly conveniences or delights, and making it valiant
against all impediments of Piety, and against the flesh; and vigorous to all
good works; and amongst other effects much illuminating the understanding.

Digr. 2. That, tho by Prayer we may dispose our selves (tho this disposing
also is from God) in some manner for those spiritual graces, and influences
supernatural, which some Saints of God enjoy in some extatical raptures, and
unions with God, and that to him that has, is given; yet that these are
supernatural always, and, for their efficiency clearly independent on our art,
or endeavors, and that God only gives them when, and where, he pleases; tho
mostwhat he pleases to give them upon our much endeavors for them.

. 113.
Imaginary place of address.
18. Ordering, and fashioning in your thoughts (and this without much
curiosity, or trouble to your fancy) an imagined place of your addresses to God
(or our Savior;) and a several manner of his presence, and appearance to you,
such as may make most impression upon you, and may suit best with the subject
of your present meditations, and devotions, (whether it be Confession; or
Thanksgiving; or Petition; or Doxology, etc.) [Which composition of place will
make you more sensible what you are, who, and what, He, to whom you speak; and
breed high degrees of humility, love, resignation, shame, compassion, and
tenderness, according to the business you then negotiate with him.] As,
representing to your self, God, in his Majesty, according to the visions of
Ezechiel, c. 1. Esai. c. 6. Dan. c. 7. St. John, Apoc. c. 4. etc. Our Savior,
in his gentleness, and familiarity, and readiness to help, according to some of
those postures you read in the Gospel. Or, in his Glory, according to Rev. 1.
or 19. Chapters.

. 114.
In confessing of, and beging mercy and pardon for, your sins; imagining your
self appearing, as a poor prisoner in shackles, haled before him sitting in
Judgment. Or, as the prodigal Son, returning with shame before his Father. Or,
as one full of Ulcers, and Sores before a Physician that can certainly cure
him. Or, as one taken prisoner, and kept in chains by his enemy, and begging
his freedom from his own Prince passing-by in triumph. Or presenting your self
to him, as if you lay on your deathbed. Or, as when you were in some danger of
your life: In an extraordinary storm of Thunder, Earthquake, Shipwreck; in your
last sickness. Or, as if the trumpet were sounding, and the dreadful day of
Judgment had surprised you. Or, as if you suffered the torments, which Dives
does; yet with some hopes of being delivered. And, such passion for pardon, and
resolutions for amendment, as you would put on in such a case, those presently
entertain, and so bespeak God; (for such things are no fictions, but one day
will come upon you.) Again; addressing your self to our Savior; as Peter cried
out when sinking in the waves; Or, when he cried: Lord, not my feet only, Jo.
13.9. Or, weeping, -- as he, when his good Master looked back upon him, after
he had denied him. Or, as blind Bartimeus importuning him for the restoring of
his sight, Or, as the Paralitick, expecting that good word; thy sins are
forgiven thee, etc, (for instances are infinite): such like addresses may
profitably be used for acts of Confession, and beging pardon.

. 115.
2. Again in thanksgiving for his benefits, and especially that of your
redemption, imagining your self standing before the Emperor of the whole world,
condemned to dye the most horrible death, for treason against him; and then
this Emperor sending his only Son (that justice may not be defeated, all
others refusing) to dye for you, one of the vilest of all his subjects; and
then, being (thus) delivered, say to him, what your heart shall tell you. Or,
imagining your self to accompany our Savior (having first charged himself with
your guilt, and to answer justice for it) quite through his passion. Being
behind him in the Garden, at the time of his Agony, and sweating of Blood: When
He tied with cords, and carried away Prisoner, you with Peter, and John
following, and beholding his usage in the Judgment-hall; and weeping with
Peter, when he looks on you the Sinner he so suffers for: Beholding his cruel
whipping at a Post; following him from thence, and helping him with Simon (when
he faints with their hard usage) to bear his Cross: Then, with his distressed
Mother, and Disciple, standing before him, hanging, and bleeding on the Cross;
and then, drawing nearer, and with great compassion to his innocence, and grief
for your sins that caused such his pains, desiring to bear part of his sorrows,
and resolving also to suffer all things for him, say further what your heart
shall teach you: But then finding him (after he is risen again, and exalted
over all) still at his Prayers, and Intercessions to the Father for you, Say
again, and resolve, what your heart shall teach you. So also, for other
benefits; imagining God sitting on the top of heaven, compassed with all
Celestial Courtiers looking down on millions of men; and dispensing, here
judgments, there mercies; and, amongst so many millions taking notice of you,
and before his Angels testifying his good will unto you and desire of your
Salvation, and sending by the chiefest of his train many gifts, and tokens of
his love, and withal diverting his judgments from coming nigh your dwelling,
and then, falling down, see whether your heart can thank him.

. 116.
3. In praising, or giving glory to God, or our Savior, imagining the Show,
Rev. 4.8. or 5.9. -- 7.10.12. and your self amongst that Heavenly Quire, crying
Holy, Holy, etc. Es. 6.3. Or Bless the Lord with me all ye his Angels, etc.
Psalm. 103.20. Or crying, Glory in the highest, with the multitude at our
Saviors triumph, Luke 19.37. etc. Or with Mary giving Glory to, and
worshipping, him leading Captivity captive upon his Resurrection-day: Or, with
Stephen, him standing at the right hand of God.

. 117.
4 In petitioning him for spiritual graces, or temporal necessities, Imagining
our Savior as at his last Supper giving his Body etc, or as sitting on Jacob's
Well, and you beging of him with the Samaritan Sinner; Lord give me that water
etc; or with the Canaanitish Woman asking for some crumbs that may fall from the
Childrens table; or patiently sitting with Mary at his feet, to receive his
gracious answer or the unum necessarium.

So, for making intercession for others; Imagining a friend in prison, or
torments, crying out for your aid, as you pass by, and that some few words
spoken by you may procure his liberty, or save his life. Or, some part of your
body wounded, and pained, and that you are going to seek help for it. Or rather
that some member of your blessed Savior (as all true Christians are) was some
way distressed; and that he (after so much kindness showed to, and
intercessions made for, you) would try now the return of your love to him in
interceding for it, etc. Now, who thinks such acts of imagination useless, let
him only consider the great effects of Imagination in another kind which he
has experienced (in advancing his lusts, and many false pleasures, and
conceited felicities) sometimes in, sometimes before, the acting of a sin.

. 118.
Frequency of Prayer.
19. Not omitting your Prayers, when you find in your self little devotion, or
also much distraction of thoughts etc. For, if it be a fault to do them
slightly, it is a greater, not to do them at all. And God many times gives
unexpected grace to those who endeavor; and devotion is often acquired by
entering into Prayer, when we had it not before.

20. Not omitting and thinking your self excused from your private daily
devotions, by your presence at some common. For, besides that those are many
times a necessitated, these a more free will, offering and worship, who is
there that has not particular sins, necessities, mercies, which are not, in
the public prayers, confessed or petitioned for?

21. Using many times or hours of Prayer, or Meditation, in the day (and that
rather upon your knees, for so you will be more observant what you are doing)
according to the best permittance of your ordinary employments; custom of
praying at length will make you in love with praying, i. e. conversing with
God. Frater, eamus paulisper precatum. Aloys Gonzaga.

22. Not omitting your set devotions, for the intervening of ordinary business,
or ordinary works of Charity: Because you stand more obliged in this duty
toward God, and greatest Charity toward your Soul, than in some lesser
toward your own, or toward your neighbors, temporal affairs: And because
also, whether our own, or our neighbors, business, it is much more furthered
by our prayers (procuring God's blessing) than by our labors: and indeed when
we have most business, then have we most use of Prayer.

23. Using some set times annual, monthly, or weekly for your extraordinary
devotions, Confessions, and reviewing your Spiritual Condition.

24. Using extraordinary times of Prayer before, and after, extraordinary
employments.

25. Avoiding Taedium mentis as in all things, so in your devotions. For such,
who delight not in their work, cannot long persevere in it. This taedium is
always relieved by variety of employment. According to the old rule of the
Religious; Nunc lege, nunc ora, nunc cum fervore labora; Sic erit lora brevis,
and labor ille levis.

26. Therefore always entertaining, besides Prayer, another (continual and
daily) employment: for, as no vocation may be entertained, that very much or
wholly hinders our devotions, so neither are our devotions (amongst so many
other Christian duties, and interests) to be made our whole vocation.

. 119.
Ejaculations in the Intervals of Prayer.
27. In the intervals of set times, using continually short versicles of
Devotion, pious ejaculations, and aspirations to God; (for one is always
thinking on what he most loves): and these ejaculations belonging to any part
of Prayer (i. e.) thanking, or praising, or confessing, or petitioning etc. And
let these oblations continually ascend from the Altar of your Soul, even whilst
you follow your worldly affairs; stealing as it were from them into the temple
of your heart, to worship God, and to fan, and keep in there, the fire of your
Devotion.

28. Taking occasion from any thing that occurs to your senses, to bless God,
and to use those called occasional meditations. See Introd. Part. 2.13. cap.

Digr. A Collection of some Exemplary Forms.

. 120.
Reciting of Psalms.
29. Committing to memory Psalms (altered to your purpose) or other Hymns,
which may be continually ready to be offered to God in your Soul, now the
temple of his Spirit; (as God required concerning the law ( Deuteronomy. 6.7.) when
you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way: when you lie down, and
when you rise up; and when you put on your clothes, when in impertiment
company; when at meals etc. to prevent evil thoughts; vain discourse, or
attention to it; intemperate eating; to divert any temptation, to recover your
self out of a passion etc. ( Ephesians. 5.19, 20. Col. 3.16. Jam. 5.13.) the saying
of which will put the mind into devotion, when they find it not so.

30. Many times the Soul is more affected with them, when sung, or used in
verse.

31. At a set time of the day saying such a Psalm, fitted for your purpose,
which needs to take up no time almost from your employment, and will renew in
you the Spirit.

32. For better fitting them for your purose, Omitting; transposing; some
verses. Joining some parts of several Psalms into one. Changing David's
professions, into petitions: As: for [I love] Let me love etc. Changing the
present, or preter, tense into the future, and e contra. Making universals
every where particulars as, for [we, our, us] I, me, my. Using your praises
etc, rather in the second, than third person; and discoursing not only of God,
but with him as [O Lord thou art,] rather than [the Lord is] which causes to
you more reverence, and attention, to what you say, and minds you more of God's
presence. Applying to Christ, and the Church, and their triumphs, or troubles,
all said of David, and Sion; And to your, and the Church's, spiritual enemies,
flesh, or its lusts, world, and devil, all his deprecations against his foes:
(doing this also in your mind whenever you hear them read.) Furthering your
self with some of a several devotion, according to the several parts of Prayer
(i. e.) for Confession; for Thanksgiving; for Doxology; for Aspiration, etc.

. 121.
Length of Prayer.
33. As tasking your self to set times; so, at every of these times, to a large
proportion thereof (measured by a glass, clock, or watch) indispensably to be
bestowed on this holy exercise. This time of Prayer being the chief and most
proper season of all good thoughts, and holy inspirations, and strong
resolutions to Piety.

34. And this set, and large proportion of time: Both because so all
festination, and sudden riddance of a set form (which most are liable-to, in
this so burthensome-accounted duty) may be prevented; And also because much
hesitancy, dullness, unpreparedness, coldness, evagation of thoughts, hardly yet
diuerted from our last employments, do accompany the beginning of Prayer: but
much tenderness, and consolation, and complacency, and incalescence of holy
affections arise from the continuance of it (long meditation of God, as it
were, irresistibly kindling, and then inflaming, our passions toward him.) For
which reason it is said: motto pict vale il fin d'oratione, ch'il principio. So
that who makes have to end their Prayers entertain only the pain and toil, but
forbear to taste the sweetness, and benefit, thereof. See several ways for
enlarging Prayer below.

. 122.
Digr. 1. Of the exceeding small number of those minutes of the day, which are
ordinarily spent in this negotiation of our Salvation, and intercourse with
Heaven. And of the gross abuse of that text Matt. 6, 7. urged in general by
slothful, and carnal Christians, against all repetitions, and long Prayers;
notwithstanding the known contrary practice of our Savior (who continued whole
nights in Prayer; and rose a great while before day to pray etc.) and of the
Saints (See Luke 6.12.) Mark 1.35. Luke 2.37. -- 1. Tim. 5.5. Act. 12.12. comp.
6. Ephesians. 6.18. 1 Thessalonians. 5.17. etc.

Digr. 2. That Holy men have recommended an hours time to be spent in it; the
half of which seems the least that may be, for those of less practice herein,
to perform them with any considerable devotion. It being observed, that any
extraordinary visitations, and consolations of the Spirit, happen not, but
after long time of Prayer, unless only to those who have a long time exercised
themselves in this divine duty.

Digr. 3. That to those, in whom the love of God is perfectly formed, Prayer is
the chiefest pleasure of their life; nor do they force themselves to lengthen,
but to restrain, the time spent therein, nor to heighten their passions
therein, but to abate them: And the vehement desire of this perpetual converse
with God, makes company, eating, the necessary exercises, and recreations of
the Body etc. that hinder them from it, very painful to them.

. 123.
35. One long time of Prayer better, than many short ones.

36. A short time better spent in some one head of Prayer, than in hastily
running through all; for devotions continually flitting are frigid, and
languishing; and so often changing of the fuel hinders the enkindling of the
passions, nor have they that earnestness, and importunity with them, which is
required in this wrestling with God. Yet where is a sterility in thinking on
any subject, there is a necessity to change it.

37. Avoiding taedium, and wearisomeness of mind (if any happen before our time
expired) by change of our meditations; and of our posture; or by spending part
of our time in meditation, recitation of Psalms, etc. part in prayer; or part
in a set form, and part in mental prayer; and abiding in that wherein we are
most affected.

. 124.
Repetitions.
38. Often using Repetition (especially in set forms of Prayer) by which if we
passed over any thing slightly the first time, we may better remind it the
second: or, if at first any thing said do much move us, we may the longer
continue the same passion. A great help to devotion, wherein a rest, and
vacancy (as it were) of the understanding, the will, and affections, add a new
fervor to our former conceptions; and never vain, but when done without a
renewed devotion; which devotion being any way enlarged by some other
considerations, the former words still become a new Prayer. The power whereof
consists not in much speaking, but in much beseeching; and in the importunity
of our desires, and sighs, not our loquacity. See Daniel's Prayer. Dan. 9.4.

. 125.
Importunity in Prayer
39. Not desisting in our requests, not presently answered by God; but
continuing them with all fervency, importunity, tears etc. never fainting,
according to our Saviors command ( Luke 18.1, 5. Luke 11.1.8, 9.) which argues
that God hears not always at first, but expects we should trouble him (Even
as a Neighbor) when doors shut; in bed; at midnight (See Psalm. 44.23.) but this
chiefly in things spiritual; or temporal in order to the other (the usefulness
of them being first impartially weighed) where we cannot err in the goodness of
the thing we desire.

40. As for other temporal things ( since we ought not to be for them very
solicitous, but to all indifferent; since we many times(set on by some
undiscovered lust) do ask of this our Father things hurtful ( stones for bread,
serpents, and poison, for meat); since in these things we ought always to use
great modesty, in leaving them to his wisdom, and in silently relying on his
care, having a promise for necessaries, none for plenty) always observing
rather a great moderation, and indifferency in your requests; Saying with St.
Austine, Te faciente quod vis, da mihi libenter sequi. Which request for such
things, when our importunity receives also of him, it is many times more out of
pity to our infirmities, than charity to our needs, or advancement of our
perfection. See Matt. 6, 7, 8. spoken especially of soliciting for earthly
things; which are shut up in a few words. ( ver. 11.)

. 126.
Liberty of expression in Prayer.
41. Using liberty of words, and unconfined, and unprescribed expressions.
These, 1. More hindering any evagation of thoughts; and procuring more intention
of the mind to the business in hand. [Where note that prayers said by heart,
because with some difficulty remembered, keep the mind more attentive than
prayers read. Again Prayers extempore, or new conceived matter or expressions,
more than set forms repeated by heart, (except very much advertency, or also
some repetition, or meditation of them be used) because, in those forms
swimming lightly in the memory, the fancy unengaged (yet seldom idle) is left
at liberty for other employments; and the mind ordinarily less minds its
former, (especially after its often repetition of them) than its new,
conceptions.]

2. Being more obedient to the operations, and impressions of the holy spirit
(which especially directs us in Prayer) and to the spiritual inclinations of
our passions; which are sometimes more sorrowful, and fitter for acts of
contrition; sometimes more lightsome, and fitter for thanksgiving, and praise.
Now to both these are set forms an extreme restraint, to the great loss of the
Soul.

3. Being more pliable to our present condition, and necessities, continually
varying, to which one set form can no way suit.

4. Lastly; giving us much more content, and delight in our Prayers, and making
us more willingly to frequent this duty, where more liberty is allowed to our
affections.

. 127.
Ways of enlarging.
42. At least after your set form ended, enlarging your Prayers with some
unprescribed devotions, till custom has made them more easy, though he that
is truly sensible of his own vileness and defects, of God's greatness, and
goodness, and so thirsts after him, and loves much, needs not fear but to pray
well; this consisting not in much saying, but in much supplicating; and God in
nothing so much as in Prayer, accepting the will for the whole deed.

43. Guiding your self by some heads first well ordered, and multiplied as you
see fit; (for the more sub-heads you have, the more easy it is to continue in
Prayer) assuming the next still into your thoughts, as your devotions happen to
be exhausted in the former. As for Example: If you practice -- 1. Praise; and
in this -- I giving glory to God, 1 in his attributes, 2 in his works, and
blessings to mankind in general: 3 For his benefits to you in particular; and,
in both these, first, for spiritual, then temporal -- 2 Prayer. And in this
first 1. Confession of sins [In evening prayer joining examination of
conscience for the sins of the day past, and more particular confession of the
sins thereof.] Then 2. Petition; 1 for his forgiveness of sins past; 2 for your
reformation, and his preservation and preventing of you from those, and all
other, for the future; particularizing in your ordinary sins -- 1. Against God;
2. Your self; 3. Your neighbor; that is your opposite facts to the several
particular duties to each of those; (Some chief ones of which I have set down
before, and hinted to you in this Book.) [Saying; Lord, hereafter deliver me
from Gluttony etc. Detraction, etc. Distrust of thy providence etc.] 3 for his
averting evils due to them. 4. For his bestowing gifts necessary -- Spiritual;
temporal. Making your petitions also for these spiritual, and temporal gifts,
particular; according to the distinct considerations of your duty. 1. To God.
2. To your self. 3. To your Neighbor; and to these your neighbors, either to
your Superiors, and your Parents; or your brethren (for which duties (if you
have no better Catalogue) you may run over those above mentioned in this Book)
[saying: Hereafter grant me Temperance, etc. -- Charity to my neighbor; to
suffer long, and to be kind etc. (1. Cor. 13.4, 5, 6, 7.) love of the Lord my
God with all my heart etc. ( Matt. 22.37. etc.) 3. Oblation, (considering
wherein we may further serve God); and Resolutions.4. Intercession; For Church,
State, Persons of particular relation. [But here note, that it is not amiss at
first, to have a set form composed, very particular, and distinct, according to
these heads, and their subdivisions; then this form perfectly committed to
memory. Then at last, to practice varying from it in expression, and
enlargement of your conceits; yet with a retiring still, as need is and as your
extravagancy is exhausted, to the matter thereof] or, if you use not this
practice, you may follow the several parts of Prayer (set down before etc.)
only changing the order: first taking in hand the fourth; then second; then
first; third; fifth; sixth. Sometimes dwelling longer on one, sometimes on
another (as your Meditations abound); and then passing over the rest more
briefly. Or you may run over those Subjects of Meditation following p. First
all those begetting humility; then those producing love.

44. Yet not being too careful to keep a strict Method (when you have any
fervor of Spirit,) but freely intermingling petition, and praises;
thanksgiving, and confession etc, as we see it is in the Psalms, the patterns
of all prayer and praise; for the passion of love many times holily dotes and
uses to be exorbitant, and unjudicial.

45. Of several other ways of enlarging prayer. As; using the repetition of
Psalms (got by heart) in them; these being the chief stock and treasure of
devotion; of which whosoever is well provided can never be barren, or at a stand in
them. Meditating upon the several parts (one after another) of, the Lord's
Prayer; Creed; Ten Commandments; Jo. 17. c. Any Psalm, or Hymn; Magnif.
Benedict. Te Deum. Staying upon every part so long as your imagination suggests
any acceptable matter; and exercising several acts of devotion, (as Confession,
Petition, Praise, etc.) according to the subject. Or staying only a short set
time on every one, and so running through many such prayers etc. at once. Or
staying, only one respiration upon every substantial word; this only to cause
you to say it with more attention, and devotion. Taking some other place of
Scripture (which are not Prayers) as our Savior's Sermon; the later ends of
St. Paul' s Epistles etc; turning precepts and commands into requests. Making a
swift cursory over some of the Psalms, and offering up what petitions, and
Confessions, concern you. Good Lord, we have so many wants Spiritual and
Temporal to petition thee for: so many sins, especially those wherein we still
offend thee, to ask thy pardon for; so many Benefits, Spiritual and Temporal,
to thank thee for: So much wisdom, mercy, and justice, seen in all thy works,
to praise thee for; so many temptations and dangers from which to beg thy
preservation: So many businesses, of our own or our Friends, wherein to ask thy
counsel; or, happily dispatched, to return thee thanks; So many designs of some
good, wherein to beg thy necessary assistance; So many ways of promoting thy
Glory (the end of our Creation) wherein to offer thee our poor service; So many
snares, and inticements to sin, to resolve against, and resolutions to
reiterate, and further strengthen: So many Relatives, Spiritual and Temporal
and their necessities, to intercede to Thee for; And will any one, when he
kneels down before thee, say, he finds nothing to say to thee; or knows not,
how to continue prayer? This will be a strange excuse of neglecting this holy
duty, when Thou shall cast up our Accounts. Nay, what moment of our life is
there, wherein some or other of these do not call on us for prayer?

. 128.
Particularizing in our Prayers
46. Making your prayers, in whatever kind (Confessions, or Petitions,
Thanksgivings, or Resignations) very particular, and circumstantial. So
punctual in confessing your sins, as if, at the opening of the books at the
last day, those only of them should be found cancelled, which you had often,
and freely confessed to him: And so punctual in confessing his benefits, as if
the non-acknowledgment of any one received would stop the receipt of any more
thereafter; or that those also you had, should be retracted, when they ceased
to be commemorated.

47. Laying open before him your innermost bowels, communicating with him, as
with a friend, all your counsels, and purposes (which will make you entertain
none but good;) discovering to him again, and again, all his gifts, mercies,
deliverances; bemoaning your self to him of all your infirmities; opening unto
him all your wants with that particularity, as if he knew nothing of them. (The
one will make you more sensible of his goodness, the other of your need of his
help.) Reciting to, and minding him of, all his promises, as if he had forgot
them; for this is, as more prevalent with God, so more profitable to the Soul,
making you to put greater confidence in them. So in your petitions for any
grace; (As for temperance etc.) with your prayers join the motives; such as may
conduce to breed it in you, or persuade you to practice it: For any necessity,
with your prayers join the motives, which may incline God to grant it, for
these will inflame you more passionately to ask it. ( Jer. 10.1. Jer. 32.24.
Act. 22.19, 20. Esa. 37.14.)

48. Amongst many particulars singling out some more eminent sins, benefits,
wants; for which you shall more constantly beg pardon, give thanks, petition,
etc.

49. Keeping a Catalogue of all your greater sins: Of all God's greater, and
more special benefits, and favors (still adding to them what shall happen
hereafter) at set times more solemnly to be reviewed, and confessed unto him.

50. So likewise keeping a collection of all the Offices, and eminent actions,
and passions of our Savior, and of the Holy Spirit, in order to your
Salvation: to be more punctually enumerated at some times in more solemn
doxologies unto them.

. 129.
Colloquies to be used in Prayer.
51. Using in Prayer frequent Prosopopeia's; Colloquies; Solliloquies: whereof
there are five more usual. 1. God speaking i. e. the Promises, and Threats,
(mentioned in Scripture) unto you. 2. Our Savior Christ speaking unto you
(according to what he has said in the Gospel.) 3. You, speaking to your own
Soul, ( Ps. 44.) 4. Speaking to God the Father. 5. Speaking to your Savior (by
your imagination) set before you in some such familiar posture in the Gospel,
as much animates your addresses. These will serve much to strengthen your
faith, and your endeavors, by thus assuming another person, and being
abstracted from your self. We thus speaking things not so easily thought on
when we act only our own persons: counselling more impartially; comforting more
powerfully etc. (See Kemp. 3. l.) To these Colloquies may be added sometimes
those with the Creatures, to praise God with us, Psalm. 103.20. Psalm. 148. To
submit to his Kingdom, etc. with us ( Psalm. 4.2. etc.) and those
expostulations with the vain, or wicked, world, with our flesh, with our
spiritual enemies, with our former sins etc. ( Wisd 5.8. -- 1. Cor. 15.55.
Psalm. 119.115. -- 9.6. -- 139.19. Mic. 7.8. Psalm. 118.13. -- 4.2.)

. 130.
Scripture expressions.
52. In all your spiritual exercises using rather scripture expressions,
sanctified by the Holy Spirit that spoke in holy men: Accepted with God; and
answered with blessings; breeding also in your more confidence. In using these
changing universals into particulars [instead of our, we, us,] I, me, etc. for
we are more passionate for our selves.

. 131.
Advantages to Prayer.
53. Using when you can those advantages your Prayers receive

1. From the communion of other Saints in public Assemblies where is your
worship of God more openly professed, and so he by you more glorified (See Heb.
10.25.) a greater promise of God's presence ( Matt. 18.20.) a greater presence
of the Angels (1. Cor. 11.10.) in religious assemblies, 1
1. From public Assembles, and Communion of Saints.
your common prayers, as forces united (whilst every one in the plural prays
for all) more powerful. Graces, and spiritual favors more ordinarily then
bestowed ( Act. 2.1. -- 4.41. -- 13.2. -- 1. Cor. 14.24, 25.30. -- 2. Chron.
20.14.) add to these, the presence of the Priest, and of some men of greater
sanctity more favorably heard of God, the benefit of whose prayers you
partake; consecration of the place etc.

2. In such public service applying the general praise, petition, etc. to your
own particular necessities, benefits received etc. Intercessions, to those to
whom you have more relation. And in confession of sin, and some other actions,
changing universals [us, our, etc.] into [me, I,] which experience will show
you to make your prayers more affectionate, and attentive; excepting to those,
who have attained more perfection.

. 132.
2. From holy places.
2.
2. From holy places. Choosing rather, as often as opportunity permits, to offer
up also your private prayers in a place that is holy, and consecrated to God's
name; and appointed to be the house of prayer. ( Matt. 21.13.) And this; not
only, because this place, sequestered from transaction of worldly affairs,
hinders us from many secular disturbances; and the reverence thereof makes us
more considerate in our behavior, and fervent in our devotions; and breeds in
us (as being his own house) a much stronger imagination of God's presence
whilst we pray; But also, because these places seem to have more peculiar
promise of his extraordinary presence there, and giving audience to our
prayers, and granting our requests. See Exodus 20.24. -- 2. Chron. 7.15, 16.
(Which promises why should they not remain still in force; since under the
times of the Gospel the public places of God's worship are not demolished, but
only multiplied?) And so, of the presence of his Ministers the Holy Angels, who
are his ordinary train, and attendants (See 1. Cor. 11.10. Genesis 28.17.19. Psalm.
139.1. Genesis 4.12.14.16.) Therefore has it been the venerable custom of all
Antiquity, to repair to Churches, to the Memorials of Martyrs; and to recommend
to God, rather there, also even their private devotions. (See Act. 3.1. Luke
24.53 Act. 22.17. Luke 18.10.)

. 133.
3. From holy times.
3.
3. From holy times. In laying aside all your own both business, and pleasures (
Isa. 58.3.13.) Using oftener, and longer private devotions; and begging some
more special favor on those days, than at other times.

1. On the Lord's day, the Christians Sabbath: Being a type, and pledge of that
day to come (of eternal rest, and praising God in his Temple) which is promised
us (See Heb. 4.9.10.) and this seventh portion of our time, being the tribute
thereof, which God has set apart, as for our more solemn service of him, and
prayers (He having as a house, so a day of Prayer): so for a time, when God
gives, as it were, a more special audience unto them, and dispenses greater
blessings.

2. On the other Festivals of our Savior. Then always meditating for some
little time on the action, and mystery of the day: When also you may advance
your devotion, by using imaginary composition of place, and imaginary senses:
(as if you were present at such action, with such persons; (as, in the feast of
the Epiphany, prostrating your self before Jesus with the wise men; embracing
him with Simeon etc.) and saw, and heard the several passages thereof:) and
imaginary addresses to our Savior in such and such a posture; saying to him
what your heart will pour out. As it is a day of his suffering or triumph, so
tuning your Soul to it in Suspirations, or Hosanna's, Elegies, or Doxologies:
Using such Psalms etc, as were chiefly penned for these times; as for the one (
viz. time of sorrow) Psalm. 22. -- 69. -- 35. -- 38. -- Esa. 53. altered to a
speaking of them to our Savior, as Psalm. 22.1. Thy God, thy God, why has he
forsaken thee. etc. For the other (time of joy) Psalm. 45. -- 39. -- 72. etc.
Preferring to God some special petition with respect to the day: See an Example
in the Collects of these days.

3. On the Festivals of the Saints, the former leaders of our faith (See Heb.
13.7. -- 12.1.) Performing the duty of an honorable Commemoration of that
Saint to whose memory the day is dedicated: (See Luke 1.48. Matt. 16.13.) And
saying, and doing, something in honor of them (remembering the intimate
communion, and spiritual consanguinity you have with them) so as you would do
for one of near relation to you in the flesh; and this, not as to them dead,
but now living in Glory with Christ; and as to those, by the uncessant, and
most compassionate prayers of whom (our fellow members triumphant) we receive
continually great advantages, whilst we are yet in the fight; where, if Dives
remembered his brethren, much more do they. Meditating on the Life of that
Saint, and proposing some one thing therein, for your imitation. In that day
beging of God some one of those graces, and virtues, which God had more
eminently bestowed upon him. See Examples in the Collects.

. 134.
Digr. That those who more honor the Saints (those friends of God that laid
down their lives, etc. for him) are by God made more partakers of the benefits
of their prayers: (As in ancient time frequent experience has showed) these
our respects to them being only for their faithful service to him; and this
honoring of the servant finally redounding to the Master; ( Matt. 10.40.42.)
and God not suffering, as not any charity, so not any honor, done to his, to
go unrewarded.

4. From holy, 4
and consecrated persons, presenting your Prayers to God. 4. From holy persons.


Digr. Of the Reverence to be had to Times, Places, Things, Persons,
Consecrated.

. 135.
II. Concerning Meditation.
1. Often using Meditation, the greatest nourishment of Piety, and Devotion.
And this, upon some one particular subject. At some set time. And that time the
space of an hour; that you may attain some fervor in it; or not less than half
an hour. And this time, rather in the morning; when your Spirits are most
fresh, and clear, and undiscomposed. This Meditation to be used then (as you
please) as part, or out of Prayer (the greatest part of Meditation always being
Prayers); in any posture, walking, sitting, or in bed, (where there is more
privacy) so it be toward the morning; when you are free from all drowsiness.

2. To make you more exact, and experienced, in all the particular heads of
Devotion, it is recommendable, to change daily, or often, the subject of your
Prayers; employing the most of your Prayer time upon some selected points of
some one head of Meditation, such as those following. page

3. Concerning your Subject of Meditation: always having some chief points upon
it, (some for your reason, others for your affections to work on;) whether
composed by your self, or borrowed from another (See Introduct. to a Devout
Life) and written down, that your memory may not be burdened passing (in your
exercise) in order from one of these to another; as your thoughts multiply
less, or more, upon them: The more you collect, and the fewer at one time you
insist on, the better. And if also each point be grounded on, or confirmed
with, some sentences of Scripture, you shall find these much more to move you
(as being God's words) than the wisest dictates of humane reason.

. 136.
Meditation practiced four ways.
4. Prosecuting your meditation on these points, both by the brain, and the
heart: by cognoscitive, and the affective faculties, these four ways;

1. Imagination.
1. By using much your fancy or imagination: and that, in all parts of this
exercise; but especially in your preparation to it: Imagining place, time,
person, and other circumstances (such as may more work on your passions) into
which, and amongst, and before, whom you shall suppose your self transposed
during the time of your meditation. (See before.) Things by the operation of
fancy represented as it were to sense, making much more impression on you, than
intellectual: In the same manner that things seen do, than things related.

1. For the help of this Imagination reducing things spiritual, and things
unknown (tho far greater) to things of sense and things experienced (tho much
less, and no way comparable to the other). Because things less, yet known, move
us more, than those incomparably greater, unknown.

Digr. Some examples of these, for the help of weaker fancies: and that some
sensitive imaginations or other may be used in the most spiritual Meditations.

2. Using imaginary senses: i. e. proposing to your self, such actions, and
motions to be seen, such discourse heard, by you; your tasting, touching,
embracing such things, etc. as you fancy most agreeable, and proper, to the
subject you have in hand.

. 137.
2. Reasoning.
2. -- By using your memory, and intellect, in calling to mind, and much
weighing and pondering, things well known; and agitating them in your thoughts;
and seeking such reasons, and considerations, out of them which may any way
incline your will to its duty, and excite your affections to things divine.

. 138.
3. Affections.
3. -- 1. By using, in, and upon, these the affective part of of your Soul, 1.
and indulging your passions; whereby your spirit, may as it were burst out,
and extend, and stretch it self (toward its Creator, and the several ends of
its creation, and toward the renouncing of all things opposite) in such acts
as these (according to the object;) humility, fear, shame, sorrow, indignation,
revenge, confession, aversation, detestation, contempt, abjuration,
deprecation, etc: Or, admiration, love, desire, beseeching, joy, election,
aspiration, embracing, promising, imitation, hope, confidence, praise,
thanksgiving, resignation, union, tenderness, pity, compassion, zeal, tears,
etc.

2. For these observing this general rule; That whenever (tho in the exercise
of the understanding, and reasoning) any devout affections, and motions of the
heart (infused doubtless by that good Spirit, which our Savior left to dwell
in us) arise, you give place to, and indulge, them, and not defer, and throw
them off, till you have first finished your discoursings (the end of which is
only to excite them). For, though the affections are ordinarily more active
after some time of Meditation, and sometimes a many considerations may pass in
great coldness without any awakning of them at all; yet there is a time again,
when the very first stroke of our thoughts sets them on fire, especially to
those, who have been often practiced in this exercise.

. 139.
4. Resolutions.
4. -- After these, lastly by making some good resolutions for the future. For
all Meditation whatever, whether of our Savior's Life and Death, or any other
mystery of our Salvation; or Meditation of our Sins; or of the four Novissima;
all is to be directed to some Reformation of our manners, or advancement in
Perfection, always looking on ours as far distant from the top thereof. And
this discussion of our Conscience and resolutions for this are always to be
joined with the other; and the time of our Devotion to be as it were divided
between both, viz. such Contemplations, and our Resolves. Still rising from our
Prayers as fully purposed to lead a new life, much different from our former;
knowing, that, in the holiness and purity of this, and cleanness from lesser,
or venial, as well as mortal, Sins, chiefly lies our pleasing of God, and
procuring a greater measure of his Spirit.

1. Here then first making a Resolution concerning some particular duty, or
fault, (for the future, or at least for the day ensuing,) to be done, or
forborne. Purposing also the means how you may better effect these your
purposes; having considered before hand the occasions of the day; and what
hindrances of them may happen, and what furtherances may be used.

2. A second Resolution concerning your not abandoning your self (if you chance
in that time to fall into, or commit any act of that thing resolved against) to
continue in it; but an endeavoring, through the help of God's grace,
immediately, and without delay to rise again, and set on foot your former
purpose, etc.

3. Briefly desiring God to strengthen you in these resolutions, through the
mediation, and intercessions of Christ for you, in this business.

5. After your meditation ended, briefly recollecting, and repeating in your
mind, or also writing, the things, wherein you were most affected, to make
rather use of them another time.

6. Changing the subject of your meditation, after having some several times
practiced it, to avoid taedium, and to acquire new benefit from others.

. 140.
Subjects of Meditation
7. Subjects of these Meditations may be any of those Considerations set down
in the beginning of these Papers; as likewise some exemplary Histories.

1. The most useful of those Considerations are these.

The CONSIDERATIONS of
Our selves that pray: our vileness and defects. God to whom we pray; His
infinite greatness, and perfections.
Our Sins; and small service. Gods benefits, particular; and comparative with
others: and our great obligations. The several offices, and benefits of Christ
toward us. The several offices, and benefits of the Holy Spirit toward us.
God's Threats, and Hell. God's Promises, and Heaven.
The vanity, and perishing of things present, and death; which exercise may
profitably be performed in the particular meditation of the Death of some
Acquaintance. Eternity of things future*
Such Meditations as these serve to beget much humility in us. These, to beget
a great love of God in us.

Digr. Some points or heads for Meditation on each of these: only named, not
discoursed on.

2. The most useful amongst Historical Meditations are these.

. 141.
The Meditation of

1. Our Savior's Life, Passion, Resurrection, and Glory.

1. The two first producing Admiration, Praise, Thanksgiving, and Compassion:
zeal of Imitation; In doing all good; suffering patiently all evil; mortifying
our selves to the flesh, and the world; And all these, to become conformable to
this our great Lord.

The last encouraging, and strengthening our hope, confidence, etc.

2. In these Meditations always considering our Savior (in doing, and
suffering such things) severally; both as God, and as man. See p. 147. n. 3.

3. Meditating of all our Savior's actions, and sufferings (to move you to
more passion) as done, and undergone for you alone, and as if your single sins
had caused all that his sorrow, and pain: and that he, first exactly knowing,
and considering them all, and all their malice, and the offense of his Father,
and the damnation waiting for you (as doubtless all this he did,) voluntarily
undertook the burden of them; and just sorrow, and pains due unto them; and
thus begged, and obtained your pardon and glorification (See Gal. 2.20. -- 1.
Cor. 8.11.)

Digr. The most considerable points of our Savior's History ordered (See
Exercit* Spiritual) some few of which, at a time, in order, to be meditated on.

2. St. Paul's Life (because, next our Savior's, more fully expressed in the
Holy Scriptures, than any others) or some Patriarchs of the Old Testament.

Digr. The most considerables of his life ordered for Meditation. Amongst which
especially these places to be considered (one at a time.) Acts 20. the 7th
verse and from the 18th, to the 28th. Acts 28.23. -- 2. Cor. 11. chapter from the
23d to the 30th verse. 2. Cor. 6. from the 3d from the 11th. 1. Cor. 4. from
the 9th to the 14th. 1. Cor. 9. from the 1st to the 7th, comp. 15.26, 27.
verses. Phil. 3. from the 7th to the 15th. -- 2. Cor. 12. from the 2d to the
11th.

Of all these Meditations abovementioned, the two chiefest are. 1 The
Meditation of our Sins. 2 Of the life and passion of our Savior.

Of these two again, the more principal is the later; because examples work
more than any thing else upon us; and this, of the Son of God, is much
transcending all other Examples.

. 142.
III. Examination of Conscience.
1. Using frequent Examination of your Conscience at least once a day; for a
quarter of an hour immediately before going to rest; then reviewing the several
employments of the day from hour to hour, and reciting them to God, with a [
God be praised; or God forgive me] affixed. A Duty never to be laid aside,
since the more perfect we are the greater will such sins seem unto us; and ill
habits will be prevented at least; and our repentance (by looking into these
smaller parts of our life) will become more and more particular, and so by
degrees more perfect.

2. The chief points of Examination to be, concerning the ordinary sins of your
calling. The particular sin you are most inclined to, and are now in an
exercise or profession of repentance concerning it. Sins of discourse, our
daily evil, and continually beating pulse, whch truliest discovers to us the
inclinations of the heart. ( Matt. 12.34.) Evil thoughts, some
discontentedness, or Temptations entertained; or weakly resisted. See the chief
heads in which the most holy shall find himself less, or more, guilty, and
defective, set down by Kempis, 4. l. 17. c. 2. Sect. Concerning what good God
has been pleased to do that day by you, for to thank him; (from whom all our
holy desires, and good Councils and just works, do proceed.) Especially
concerning what good you have done that day to your neighbors; whether any way
relieved any necessitous person, with your goods; ignorant, with your counsel;
discouraged vice in any, encouraged any to virtue, etc. Lastly concerning sins
of omission, always comparing yours, with the practices of some holy men, or of
our Savior; imagining how they have used the same opportunities, and all the
faculties of the soul, and of the body, to God's far greater service. In all
these confessing (things particular, not general.) Asking forgiveness:
promising (for the future) amendment.

3. That you may perform this night-examination more exactly, at some times in
the day make reflections upon your last actions: Else many less faulty will
escape your evening search: Joining the practice of the two Resolutions
mentioned above ( p. 208.) (especially concerning some particular sin, to which
you are more subject) to your morning devotions; and petitioning then for God's
assistance, and joining the abovementioned Examination of Conscience
(especially concerning that sin) to your evening devotions, and then asking
pardon, etc.

. 143.
IV. Reading Scriptures and pious Books.
1. Tasing your self every day (to supply continually matter of Meditation, of
Prayer etc.) to read some small portion of holy Scripture (this always to be
done with much reverence:) Or some other pious Book that is practical, rather
than doctrinal; and may serve not so much for teaching you what you are
ignorant of, as for reminding you of what you know. Especially avoiding any
Books of Controversy in Divinity, (being only an exercise of the Brain, and
having nothing to do with Devotion, and Piety) at such hours or seasons, when
your aim is not the information of your judgment, but edification in Holiness.

2. Entertaining the Old Testament, and all the moral doctrines, and examples
thereof, with the same reverence, as the new. Knowing that God is not mutable;
but that the same way of Salvation was always to all men from the beginning,
and the same Church, Faith, Gospel, under the times of the law; and that the
New Testament releaseth not, but rather adds to, the strictest doctrines, and
duties contained in the Old. Some of which (necessary to be observed) yet are
not repeated in the New, as supposing the direction of the Law and the
Prophets, in all moral matters, continued to Christians (See Gal. 3. chapter Heb.
11. chapter 2. Pet. 1.19. Heb. 4.2. Matt. 5.17.)

3. Reading Scriptures always with some short Comment: Which divine writings
will still seem some new things unto you; and to have greater sweetness, as you
grow in perfection, and do experience what they say fulfilled in you. For, we
ordinarily measure the purpose of its Precepts, according to our abilities to
practice them.

4. Not reading much at a time; nor hastily, (knowing that nothing is less
marked than the Scriptures, because so often read) but staying, and indulging
your meditation on any passage that affects you; and casting what you read,
sometimes into a Prayer, sometimes into an act of Admiration, Praise,
Thanksgiving, as the matter prompts to you.

5. In reading the Scriptures considering not only what is said, but the
quality, and disposition, and other circumstances of the Author that says it
(and sometimes also of those to whom it is said.) As in the psalms; consider
David, and imagine his affections from the circumstances of his life etc. in
his saying them. So in the words of our Savior; consider the circumstances of
his person, his affections etc: and imagine that you hear them from his mouth.
And you will find this much to advance both your understanding for a right
construction, and your affections for a right use, and entertainment of them.

6. Especially reading every day, and this rather after meals, (for which also
the missing of a meal, will afford you half, or a whole hours time.) Some
little portion of a more eminent Saints Life; rather late ones, than ancient,
because less uncertain; and amongst these only some few choice ones; with often
relection of them, and of the whole life in order, not some dis-joynted parcels
thereof. Which Lives serve more than any thing else to verify Scripture (If I
may so say) and to teach us that Christ's sublimest Precepts are not given in
vain; but that they are faisible (Exempla inprimis hoc in se boni babent, quod
approbant fieri posse quoe praecipiunt.) And that those greater illuminations
and holiness under the Gospel, which the Scripture so largely promises, are
continued to, and fulfilled in, all times; none of which are destitute of some
men Apostolical. Whereby we are extremely encouraged (in a holy emulation even
of the Apostles themselves,) leaving still the things which are behind, to
reach forth to those things which are before, and to attempt perfection:
whereas, without these patterns, the magnalia in Scripture are read as a
Romance, or an History of another perfecter age, which we willingly admire, but
despair to imitate. Whereby we best learn, not to lay all the burden of our
Religion upon repentance, but holiness; nor to reckon salvation so cheap a
purchase, for which we see others have taken so much pains. For, the higher we
discern others to go in Piety, the less still do we think that God will be
content with ours, when he is presented with other m ns, of the like abilities,
so much beyond it. Which thing, more than any other, provokes any generous
Spirit to a holy jealousy, and imitation; and (as one observed) Horum librorum
lectio plerumque primus est melioris vitae gradus. And most of those, who are
commonly called Saints, became so first, by reading the Lives of other Saints.
Lastly, which, more than any other thing, will preserve you (tho amidst the
flatteries of your friends) in a true humility, and mean conceit of your self,
and in a constant endeavoring to your lives end to grow better; and which
example of holy men (since the chiefest cause of wicked life in professed
Christians, so point blank contrary to our Savior's Precepts, is nothing but
ill example,) will serve you for an antidote to the poison of the other, by
which so many, so heedlesly, lose their eternal Life.

. 144.
Using pious Discourse and Company.
7. Accustoming your self to pious discoursing, which much nourishes good
thoughts, to the production at length of good actions. And quanto piu spesso
parleras di Dio, tanto piu Iddio parlera teco in anima. God's holy Spirit never
speaking by any, but that it also speaks to them.

8. Repairing often to pious Company, and holy Meetings. From such conference
arises a mutual excitement to, and fortifying, and confirming one another in,
all virtues. Medicamentum vitae fidelis amicus: Ecclesiasticus, 6.16. Gaudia
conduplicat, maerores diminuit. And such discourse is commonly more beneficial,
(Because descending to particulars; admitting replies; indulged more freedom,
digressions, etc.) then general exhortations made (more at random) in public.

9. In such meetings not leaving your discourse to be casual, (for so it will
be many times unfruitful) but designing beforehand some subject fit for such
conference.

. 145. Worshipping God with the Celebration of the Eucharist.
Thus much, from. 77. concerning that continual duty of Christians; worshipping
God with Prayer.

II. Worshipping God also with the frequent Celebration of the Eucharist,
Breaking of Bread, and eating the Lord's Supper; and with observing the
Christians solemn Sacrifice, and Passover; And Commemoration of our Savior's
Death, etc, till his second coming.

. 146.
1. Being the most effectual intercession to God, made on Earth.
Of the necessary Duty, and great Benefit of Celebrating the EUCHARIST.

1. Being an intercession with Christ's Blood, performed on earth by the
Minstery of his servants; like as to that in Heaven, by himself. Who, since
without a Sacrifice he cannot be a Priest, and is a Priest for ever, therefore
himself offers to his Father within the veil this Sacrifice for ever (See Heb.
8.3, 4. -- 9.12.) By this intercession with his Blood, applying, as it were,
and making effectual to every single Believer, and to all successive
Generations of men, all those mysteries and benefits of their redemption,
purchased, and perfected upon the Cross; And appointing his Ministers to do the
same, in this Holy Sacrament, on earth, for the same purpose he does it there,
and that is for all the same purposes for which he first offered it upon the
Cross.

. 147.
2. The Seal of the new Covenant; and the Christians perpetual Sacrifice.
2. Being the Seal of the new Covenant: And that sacred Rite, and Ceremony,
which was instituted by our Savior to be observed by Christians, for the
celebrating, and representing, and showing forth, that one only true Sacrifice
of the world offered upon the Cross; and for blessing, and giving thanks, and
praise to, and invocating, his Father, by It, (from the time of his
resurrection till the Consummation of the world), instead of all those more
antiquated varieties of Sacrifices, and Oblations under the law. To which
Sacrifices It is correspondent in many particulars. As,

. 148. Sacrifice.
1. Propitiatory.
1. Being the Christians commemorative Sacrifice of Christ's Death, answering
to the Jews sin-offering; by the Symbols of Bread, and Wine consecrated, and
sanctified by the invisible operation of the Holy Ghost, (as St. Austine
borrowing the Phrase from Romans 15, 16.) procuring (as well as the legal
Sacrifices did, i. e. in virtue of that only one expiatory Sacrifice once
offered upon the Cross), to him, who comes to it with due preparation,
Remission of his sins ( Matt. 26.28. This is my Blood shed for remission of
sins. Malac. 1.11. -- 3.3. -- 1. Cor. 11.26, 27.29. -- 1. Cor. 10.16. etc.)

. 149.
2. Impetratory.
2. Being the Christians Sacrifice etc, answering the Jews burnt-offering;
through the due celebration of which (in virtue of that only offering of a
sweet smelling savor ( Ephesians. 5.2. comp. Levit. 1.9. Exodus 29.41.) which it
represents) both a devotement and a dedication of themselves (as they also
being Christ's Body) to God is then made; (Ecclesia seipsam per Christum
offert, Austin:) and also all their petitions for themselves, and intercessions
for others, are then accepted of God; and also the descent of all good things
spiritual, and temporal, from him is procured. Therefore anciently, after
Consecration, and before receiving of these sacred Elements, were supplications
for all estates of men (absent as well as present. See 2. Chron. 29.24.) and
for all needful blessings etc. offered unto God over the Lamb of God, then
lying upon the table: slain from the beginning, before his coming, in the
Sacrifices of Beasts; and since his coming, unto the end of the world,
represented here in the Eucharist; and also at the same time it is presented by
himself to the Father in the heavenly Sanctuary ( Heb. 13.15. -- 1. Pet. 2.5.
Romans 8, 32. Jo. 16.23. Gal. 3.1. Mal. 1.11.) Therefore I say is Christ's
Sacrifice, in these mystical rites, commemorated unto the Father: and the
Father invocated (by, and through it) for all persons, and things etc. the
Ancients using this Phrase [ We offer unto thee for such and such, etc.]

. 150.
3. Federal.
3. Being Oblatio Faederalis, a Celebration of God's new Covenant of Grace,
made in the Blood of our Savior, which is the Blood of this Covenant: (See
Exodus 24. chapter Heb. 8.7. etc. Heb. 10.29. -- 12.24. comp. Luke 22.20.) This Holy
Ceremony being a Sacrament, a Seal, an Obsignation, of the pardoning all former
offenses between the parties that were at difference, and of our reconciliation
with God, and admittance to the hopes, and lawful enjoynments, of all his
Blessings, spiritual, corporal; temporal, eternal. ( Romans 4.11. Matt. 26.28.)

. 151.
4. Eucharistical.
4. Being the Christians Eucharistical Sacrifice, answering the Jews peace --
or thank-offering. 1. By which Rite we, commemorating Christ (through whom all
blessings descend to us Ephesians. 2.18. -- 3.12.21. Jo. 14.13. Ephesians. 3, 4.6. Col.
3.17. Romans 1.8. Heb. 13.15.) unto the father, do bless, and give him thanks for
all persons, and things, etc.

-- 2. Then by eating and partaking of which, as the Jews, and also Idolaters,
by eating of theirs, (therefore the eating of the Heathens Sacrifices was
always most strictly forbid the Israelites, Exodus 34.15. Numb. 25.2. Psalm.
106.18. Ezech. 18.6.) we are admitted, as it were, to the table of our God (to
eat of his bread Lev. 11.6. -- 3.11.) and to amity, communion, fellowship with
him. 1. Cor. 10.14. to 22.

3. By partaking, and eating of which Sacrifice (being the Body, and Blood of
Christ) we are admitted also to communion with the Son, and mystically
incorporated into him (who is the second Adam from Heaven. 1. Cor. 15.) made
members of his body, flesh of his flesh, etc. (and this not in a metaphor, but
in a great mystery Ephesians. 5.32.) And then, from being partakers of the Body,
become also partakers of the Spirit of Christ, 1. Cor. 6.17. (and see the
Spirit specially conferred in the Eucharist, 1. Cor. 12, 13.) and by it eternal
life conveyed to us etc. Jo. 6.58. comp. 63. (by which relation he becomes now
obliged to nourish, and cherish us etc, Ephesians. 5.30.) and, from partaking of the
nature and spirit of this second Adam the heir of all things ( Heb. 1.2. Col.
1.16.) become now Sons of God also as he; Heirs of Eternal life as he etc. as
by the first Adam we were of eternal death. (See 1. Cor. 12, 13. Ephesians.
4.24.5.29. etc. 1. Cor. 6.19.15.17.19. Jo. 17.21.23. -- 4.14.6.56, 57. comp. 1.
Cor. 10.17, 18, 24.)

-- 4. By eating, and partaking of which one bread we also become one bread
amongst our selves (1. Cor. 10.17.) and have Communion with all the Saints of
God, and partake both of the glory, and benefit, and service (in their prayers,
charity, sufferings, etc.) of all the rest of the members of Christ's Body; and
of all the family of God, as well that in heaven, as that upon earth. ( Ephesians.
3.15. Heb. 12.23. Col. 7.20. Ephesians. 2.19. Phil. 3.20.)

. 152. The Christians Passover.
5. Being the Christians Passover, answering to, and at the same time
instituted instead of, the Israelites Paschal Lamb: the Christians breaking
bread, and cup of blessing, or thanksgiving (for these two are all one 1. Cor.
10.16.) being like theirs then, at that solemnity: we giving thanks also at the
celebration of it (as they then for that in Egypt) for our everlasting
redemption (by the sprinkling upon us of the blood of the Lamb of God) from
Satan, and the destroying Angel, 1. Cor. 5.7.

. 153. Our duty of homage for the use of God's Creatures.
6. The Christians Oblation of bread, and wine (and anciently other fruits, or
(as now) alms of money instead of them) presented now upon God's table (tho
this charity far more punctually, and plentifully observed in the primitive
times) being answerable to those customs under the law of bringing to the Lord
at the Passover, the first fruits ( Levit. 23.10.14.16.) By which Oblation we,
acknowledging him the Lord, and Doner of all good things, and praising him for
all the good works of the Creation, do sanctify for the future the use of his
Creatures; do procure the continuance, and increase of them, to us: See Deuteronomy.
16.19. -- 1. Cor. 10.16. and all this only through Jesus Christ. By whom being
the natural Heir of all things ( Heb. 1.2.) we now begin to have a new right
(our former being lost in Adam's fall) to the Creatures, before unclean unto
us; and defiled also with sin (1. Tim. 4.3. Romans 14.14. Tit. 1.15. Psalm. 8.7.
Luke 11.41.) but now sanctified through God's Word, Prayer, Thanksgiving, and
giving Alms of them, (done especially now at the Eucharist) whilst to the
unclean all things remain still unclean (1. Cor. 7.14.) But then, besides all
those former benefits of the Creation, these Symbols are at this time more
specially set forth, for a thankful remembrance unto God, for the precious
death of Christ, and all other benefits of our Redemption. 1. Cor. 3.21. comp.
23.

. 154.
The Symbol of our Resurrection, and Immortality.
7. Being the Christians Viaticum; answering to the fruit of the Tree of life
in Paradise, and to the Manna, and Rock-water in the Wilderness (which were
types of it. 1. Cor. 10.2, 3, 4. -- 12, 13.) The particular nourishment
instituted (since our ejection out of Paradise) for the preserving of the Body,
and Soul, unto everlasting life; and, for a particular pledge, and assurance of
our Resurrection; (Hence, by Conc. Nicen. called Symbola Resurrectionis; and
hence, that form, used generally in the Church, Custodiat animam tuam in vitam
aeternam) See Jo. 6.32.35.40. etc. For the Son (the second Adam, that is a
quickening Spirit, 1. Cor. 15.45.) has life in himself ( Jo. 5.26); and
therefore he that eats him also lives by him. ( Jo. 6.57.)

. 155.
The Symbol of our Christianity
8. Being instituted, for a perpetually sensible Anniversary, or Memorial unto
us of our Savior's passion, and donation then of himself for, and also to, us;
so, to confirm our faith, and hope in him, and love to him; and our belief of
our being all united together in, and amongst, our selves, thereby to take away
all differences, and increase our love one to another: As likewise for a
perpetual, public, external mark of the Christian profession, to distinguish
them from all other sects, and false religions.

9. Finally, to sum up what is said, Being the chief means (worthily
received) of obtaining remission of sins, increase of the Spirit, any
particular spiritual, or temporal, blessing, or deliverances; for our selves,
or for others. All these being to be obtained only through Christ ( Jo. 11.46.)
who is in the Eucharist offered (as our own) to God the Father by us [this
given ( i. e. to the Father) for you Luke 22.19.] And again; who is, in the
Eucharist by the Father, and by himself, given to us with all the privileges
that belong unto him; for, with him are freely given us all things else Romans
8.29. [According to the which the primitive times observed a powerful efficacy
in the Sacrament for working many wonderful mercies, and deliverances to God's
servants.] -- Again, as impetratory for mercies, so this Cup of Blessing (1.
Cor. 10.16.) which the Priest blesses; This Cup of Salvation ( Psalm.
116.12.13.17.) being the most special thanksgiving, most acceptable, and well
pleasing unto God for any mercies received etc. God being pleased with nothing
that we can render unto him, but only in his Son (so often iterated, Matt.
3.17. -- 17.5. -- 12.18.) and in what is offered unto him, by, and through, and
upon, the Sacrifice of the Lamb of God: through whom be all praise, and thanks
to God for ever ( Heb. 13.12.15. Levit. 3.5. Col. 3.17.)

. 156.
The danger and loss inneglecting the use of these Holy Mysteries.
Digr. I. Of the great danger, and loss of infinite benefits, by neglecting the
use of these holy Mysteries ( Numb. 9.13. Act. 20.27.) Which being the Holy
Sacrament and instrument of the most intimate union between Christ and the
Soul, many times the devout Soul is replenished with an extraordinary sense,
and ravishing delight of this union, at the time of the using them.

Digr. Recommendation of frequentation.

2. Using the help, and seeking the benefit of this holy mystery, upon any
special occasion, and with relation to some particular end. As, for remission
of your sin; for obtaining a remedy of some infirmity, deliverance out of some
affliction; for receiving some grace, and benefit; for a thanksgiving for some
benefit received; for the helping your neighbor in some necessity; for the
increasing the Spirit, and the love of God in you, (1. Cor. 12, 13.)

3. Seting apart an hour or some good space of time immediately after your
Communion, to abide with, and entertain our Lord in Prayer now entered in Person
into your house, and present to the Soul in so extraordinary a manner. Using
the acts of Mary Magdalen in lamenting your self to him, and kissing his feet,
and attentively harkening what then he shall say to you. For this seems the
least duty and observance, you can pay to so divine a Guest, to stay with him
in your devotions, and shut out all other thoughts and business for so small a
season.

4. Often examining your self concerning the fruits (which only can be wanting
by your default) of your having so many times received it.

. 157.
The danger of using them unworthily.
Digr. 2. Of the great danger of using them without due preparation. 2. Chron.
30.20. Exodus 12.3.6. Jo. 15.5. -- 1. Cor. 11.28, 29. -- 1. Sam. 11.4. Matt.
22.12.

Digr. That the conditions, and preparations required to make us partakers of
the benefit of Christ's death and passion, are also required to make us
partakers of the benefit of this Sacrament.

Thus much of our diligent practicing all Christian Duties (whether toward
God, our Neighbor, or our Selves.) Or doing good, and what Actions are required
of us.

. 158.
Of the Four Sufferings.
Now in the last place concerning our passive duty, and suffering Evils.

1. Exercising Christian Patience.

1. Sanctifying with our willingness, and concurrence with God's pleasure, all
those sufferings, and judgments for our sins which we undergo upon necessity (
Levit. 26.41.) As being all sent by God -- much greater than these deserved by
us, -- effective instruments, and inducements to God's pardoning our former
offenses, and averting his eternal wrath from us. All redounding (if it be not
our fault) to our further benefit, and to God's greater Glory in, and by, us (
Heb. 12.11.) Lastly, in all, ability being given us to endure, according to the
intenseness of the sufferings. Dum auget Dolorem, auget patientiam. Offering
them up unto God to be accepted, through the more perfect sufferings of Christ.
This was Job's patience, so much celebrated.

2. Since God uses out of Evil to bring some greater good, especially for
those who fear and serve him, when any cross and afflictive Accident happens to
you, considering presently what greater good may possibly come to you from it;
which thing will set your heart much at rest, and facilitate your due
correspondence with the Divine good pleasure. As also the imagining that God
sends every cross, whoever is the instrument thereof, on purpose to try your
patience and behavior in receiving it, will suddenly change your anger against
such instrument into thanksgiving, and the practice of this virtue. For,
indeed, Crosses are great favors if well-husbanded.

3. Not complaining, nor bemoaning your self of them; This being a lesser
degree of impatience.

4. Patiently undergoing any natural infirmities, or defects, and the shame
that accompanies them: according to which (being not in our power) God, and his
Angels (whose praise only we ought to look after) make no estimate of us; but
according to our virtues: which, by their growing out of infirmity, become so
much more praiseworthy: Meanwhile our defects being the best preservers of
humility.

5. Patiently undergoing, and not disquieting your self for any shame coming
from some, otherwise harmless deficiencies, or also avoidable faults. As; some
ignorances, fooleries, and incivilities, undiscreet words, or actions;
Separating, as it were, the shame from the defect; and, whilst you implore
God's pardon, and endeavor to redress, and to prevent for the future the one;
accepting, and thanking God, and pardoning your self, for the other. Contrary
to the custom of men, who are angry at themselves, only in respect of the
shame, not the fault; or no less for the shame, where they are not all faulty:
But know, that all such anger, and impatience proceeds from some degree of
pride.

Digr. Of all men's (some or other) infirmities, which may make us more
contented with our own.

6. Chiefly arming your self with patience against such Crosses, which no honor
accompanies; but shame, and infamy, and that with good men; (for honorable
calamity any one can endure) as disgraces, contempts, etc, either for your
natural infirmities, or also misdeserts. Whoever has perfectly quitted the
solicitude of worldly reputation, has took away the sting of the most of
mishaps.

7. Not too solicitously avoiding, and striving to remove, afflictions
incumbent; both for the former considerations ( Numb. 12.14.) and also because,
that, many times, by humane wisdom avoiding one tolerable, by God's judgment,
we fall into another worse.

8. Advices concerning Sickness the most common, and ordinarily the greatest,
and the last, of all evils that happen to men.

. 159.
1. For your behavior before sickness, in preparing for it, Often
premeditating of it; which makes all Evils easier, and not surprising. Often
making your will, and disposing of your temporals (in which special care to be
taken of dedicating some particular proportion thereof for the poor) and
setting in order your affairs (in your intention at least) as if you were then
warned (like Aaron, or Moses, or Hezekiah) to leave the world. And doing these,
not only, That, being in perfect health, and use of faculties, you may better
perform this great duty of your stewardship in disposing more wisely of your
Master's Goods; (for which disposal you must be called to account:) or, That
you may be eased of such a trouble in your sickness, when most unfit for it,
and then may be wholly vacant for spiritual affairs: But also undertaking it,
as an exercise most beneficial for quenching worldly cares, (Quantulumcunque ut
relicturus satis habet;) minding you of your being a stranger here, as all your
Fathers were before you; occasioning Charities, etc; always, in this
employment, meditating on some portion of Ecclesiastes. Forbearing (as much as
may be) the entertainment of any long, and entangled designs etc; so that you
cannot so contentedly go off the stage of this world, and say a Nunc dimittis
in pace, when God calls for it. Carefully from time to time discharging all
debts.

2. For your behavior in sickness, in doing the duties proper to it: First,
when sickness comes, not being ashamed to show fear; and imagining it always
more dangerous than it is; and preparing your self always (though in likelihood
it is not) as if it were a sickness to death: gladly then taking occasion to
reconcile your self fully to God; and to conclude with the world: that your
recovery may more perfectly begin a new, and better, life; or your end not
surprise you unprepared: In this, not fearing so much the harm, which
melancholy and sadness may do to your Body; as the mischief which security may
do to your Soul: and knowing, that such sadness, through obtaining of God
remission of sin etc, is the readiest way also to procure your health, and, (in
the time of your sickness also) ends in more joy. For making this
reconciliation; Examining your self, by what sin it is likely you have lately
most displeased God, and doing repentance, and humiliation for it, as if it had
caused your sickness ( Jo. 5.14. Matt. 9.2.) Examining your self more specially
concerning sins toward your neighbor; those chiefly against the 5, 6, 7, 8,
9. Commandments (in which man's laws also enjoin reparation.) And making
restitution, satisfactions; Asking forgiveness etc. Forgiving, and declaring
your forgiveness toward any, that have so trespassed against you. Confessing
all your sins to God; and endeavoring to do this as particularly, as if all
confessed were presently to be pardoned, and all forgot to be answered for, at
the day of judgment. Sending early for the Priest, and confessing your sins to
him (as it is recommended to your practice by the Church) in case of a troubled
conscience, and if your Conscience be not troubled for your sin, then know you
have yet more need to do it. Receiving absolution, and the Communion: making
then a singular Confession, and Thanksgiving to God for all the greater mercies
received through your whole life. Giving alms to some poor; and desiring
especially their prayers for you. Making resolutions, and vows, (but not rash
ones; and, if it may be, with the advice of your spiritual Father, and with
making your professions also to him, as a witness of them;) concerning
reformation upon your recovery. Avoiding much (especially secular)
conversation; and removing company from you. Entertaining an attendant that can
read holy things to you, such, as you shall direct, and have provided in your
health, at that time to be administered unto you. Praying extraordinarily, if
your pains permit. Using, and, in all things obeying the Physician. Offering up
a contented patience of these sufferings to God, in regard of the far greater
desert of your sins: and that to your Savior, in regard of his far greater
sufferings for you.

. 160.
Digr. 1. Of the many times great uncharitableness, and mischief, of
encouraging sick persons with hopes of recovery: at sometimes, making them omit
the necessary preparations for death, and at other times, loose the many great
benefits of sickness, in humiliations, confessions, etc. Digr. 2. Of some
necessary questions to be proposed to the sick (See Notes of Sick.) Digr. 3. Of
various admonitions necessary to be used to the sick; as they happen to be
found, in an ignorant, or a senseless; or a presuming; or a despairing;
condition. Digr. 4. Of Psalms, and other Scriptures proper to be read to the
Sick. As Psalm. 6.22, 23.32.38.57.86.88; 90.102, 103.107.130.142, 143. Job. 1,
2. Ezech. 18. The passion of our Savior in one of the Gospels, beginning at
his Prayer in the Garden. Jo. 17. Romans 8. -- 1. Cor. 15. -- 1 Thessalonians. 4. Rev.
21, 22. Digr. 5. Of short Scripture-Ejaculations proper to be used by them (See
Notes of Sick.) Digr. 6. Directions for the behavior of the Visitors of, or
Attendants upon, the sick. Non consolari eos spe recuperandae sanitatis, See
before,. 161. n. 1. Non plorare -- Non ridere -- Non alienos sermones miscere
-- Non multum loqui; necsubtilia -- Sancto silentio Deum precari. See Vita
Camelli De Lellis.
. 161.
2. Exercising Christian Fortitude.

1. Joyfully entertaining all those temporal miseries which happen to you for
your sin (which many other servants of God have both earnestly begged of God;
and, not obtaining this, have voluntarily infliected upon themselves) and
desiring that you may suffer here yet more for them (Hic ure, seca, etc.) and
not seeking too passionately to diminish them; and, whilst much grieving, and
humbling your self for the cause thereof, yet accepting, and rejoicing in the
punishment; and hoping, in the execution of some part of God's righteous
justice upon you in this world, to find (through Christ's merits) the more
mercy in the next. ( Lam. 33.9. Jer. 30.15.)

2. Joyfully embracing the favor ( Phil. 1.29.) of all those afflictions which
happen unto you for doing your duty, and for refusing to sin: especially of
persecutions ( Matt. 5.10, 11.) saying such words as these: This is painful to
me, but acceptable to God, and he will love me for it. This thy will I
willingly suffer, and much more for thy sake O my Savior, who sufferedst so
much for me.

3. Yet taking great care, that you mistake not God's judgments upon your sins,
for trials only of your holiness; bringing forth presumption, instead of
humiliation.

Digr. That there is required a holy life, and purity of conscience (not only
for the particular cause, for which we suffer, but general) to entertain our
sufferings with true comfort, and joy. Else you ought to bear them with great
sorrow (not for them, but for your sins) as God's true judgments upon you, in
relation to them, tho executed (as it is usual) through man's injustice: God
ordinarily punishing our innocence in one thing, for our guilt in another, thus
making his scourges more bitter unto us.

4. Not shunning, nor preventing any disgraces, by foregoing the smallest duty.
Using no compliance, no diffimulation; no flattery; no timidity; modesty, or
being ashamed of good; but rather provoking evil; and exposing your self on all
occasions (in any thing for Christ's sake) to scorn, hate, danger, etc. without
fear (in thus doing) of seeming proud, or contemptuous ( Rev. 21 8.) [But the
fearful -- ]

5. Undertaking voluntarily, and with all alacrity such sufferings (tho easily
avoidable) by the enduring of which you may any way do the more good; which
troubles, though it is lawful to decline, yet it is more expedient, for
benefitting others, to entertain. Such were our Savior's; such St. Paul's
Sufferings, so much gloried of (1. Cor. 9.)

6. (One degree higher) Out of the pure imitation of our Savior; and, to be
made in all things here more conformable to him ( Phil. 3.10.) (that you may be
so much the more so, also hereafter) for the present pre-electing sufferings;
even wheren no more power of doing good to others by them, than without them.

. 162.
Digr. 1. Of the Example of our Savior, and of his Saints suffering the
greatest torments, with all patience, joy, desire. Digr. 2. Of the many
sufferings for Christianity to which the very best conditions of life are daily
exposed, and invited by God (2. Tim. 3.12.) and that as well from enemies
within (the rebelling flesh) as without (the reproaches of the Godly) the
wicked world. Digr. 3. That the more absence of afflictions is the sign of a
weaker, and more pusillanimous Christian. As God gives his servants strength to
bear what evils he lays upon them; so ordinarily laying these upon them in some
proportion to the strength which he foresees in them to bear. For, to them that
have, is given; till they have abundance.
7. To increase your patience in, and desire of, sufferings;

. 163.
Using frequent premeditation of, and making a pre-occupated acquaintance with,
them. Quod alii patiendo leve, sapiens cogitando facit.

8. Often reading the sufferings of Martyrs, and comparing your own with the
greater calamities of some others; and some of those also of the weaker Sex,
tender, delicate Ladies, flourishing in nobility, youth, beauty. Or chiefly of
your blessed Savior; and meditating often of his passion.

. 164.
9. Considering,

That these evils serve very much for advancing

1. God's Glory in your service of him: when you seem to serve him for naught,
nay to embrace misery, that you may serve him. 2. God's power, and wisdom;
showed most in rescuing, and delivering; and wonderfully, out of Evil,
extracting unexpected good. 3. The true Good of the Sufferer ( Romans 8.28.)
. 165.
1. In that the times of sufferances are far more innocent in respect of vice,
than those of prosperity. And the state of sickness, and infirmity, than the
state of health. Optimi sumus cum infirmi. Quem enim infirmum aut avaritia, aut
libido solicitat? non amoribus servit, non appetit honores. Invidet nemini;
neminem despicit; sermonibus malignis non attendit etc. Pliny, 7. l. 26. Ep.
Incusare deos, aut homines, ejus est, qui vivere velit. Tacit.

2. Are far more fruitful in production of virtues; best teaching you
self-knowledge, and humility. Knowledge of the world, and contempt thereof.
Inviting you most powerfully to the love of another world -- best teaching
prayer, and fervent devotions [Tunc Deos, tunc hominem esse se, meminit.] Are
the best ablutions, and refinings of us from former sins, and (whether
voluntary, or necessitated) the most effectual motives (through the sufferings
of Jesus Christ) to God, of pardoning them, and preventing his eternal
Judgments upon them [Deus non bis vindicat in id ipsum.]

3. Are the proper season, for the greater joys, and consolations of the
Spirit; The truest enterchanges of love (for we love one the more, for whom we
suffer, as well as e converso) and Dearnesses between God, and the Soul; even
his intimatest Communications of himself unto her ( Ps. 91.15.) The greatest
assurances of Salvations etc, are received, and perceived, in the times of
sufferings, (God not usually accumulating his, upon any other secular, joys)
therefore it was a great privilege of the disciples of our Lord, by
extraordinary sufferings, to be admitted to partake all these. (See Act. 16.25.
-- 4.8. -- 5.41. -- 2. Cor. 4.11.16.)

4. Nay; the very retirements from you, and temporary desertions of all the
consolations of the Spirit, give you an occasion of so much higher reward: Dum
a Deo derelictus seipsum quis patienter exuit; atque ita Deo, propter Deum,
caret.

. 166.
10. That the Saints Glory, in the next world, is proportionably greater, as
greater here every ones sufferings. And contrarily less; as here, more secular
content.

11. Lastly; That, for the substance of the evil, and affliction it self, It
has nothing in it so terrible, as apprehended; that long sufferings cannot be
great; And great sufferings not long. Great pains being either interquiescent,
(Omnis dolor magnus interquiescit) or nature, by them, in a short time
dissolved.

. 167.
I. HEADS for Meditation of SINS.

Use some of the Meditations set down, p. 187.. 114. and. 141.

For discovery of your sins use some of those ways prescribed before,. 77. p.
155.

Then for the measuring their true guilt, some of those Considerations such as
most move you set down, p. 1, 2 etc. To which add this consideration; That many
(dying without repentance, and out of God's Grace, in their youth, or at that
age when you also were (if you are not still) impenitent) now suffer, and so
must, world without end, Hell torments, for much lesser sins than you have
committed.

Lastly, for exercising your affections, and resolutions; Imagine with your
self, what one remitted hither out of those torments (from which the merciful
God preserving you, is all one, as if he had released you) had that poor wretch
a new time allowed him here to make his peace, would do: And then do you so
seriously, and anxiously go about your thanksgiving for God's long suffering,
(equivalent to a release,) your penances, your reformation of life, I say as
such a frighted Soul would do. O that thou may know in this thy day etc; for
(then) they shall be hid etc.

. 168.
II. HEADS for Meditation of SICKNESS, DEATH, JUDGMENT.

Consider,

1. First the great benefit, and powerful operation of this Meditation;
especially being urged by our Savior, and the other Scriptures, as a chief
motive to vigilance and diligence in well doing. For which consider those
places: Luke 21.34. -- 16.9. Matt. 24.42. etc. 2.13. Mark 13.35. Deuteronomy. 32.29.
Eccl. 11.9. -- 7.2, 3, 4. Ps. 90.12. -- 41. 1.4. -- 39.4. Lam. 1.9.

1. Being very beneficial for weakening pride, and ambition, worldly cares, and
designs; and generally all sin, and inordinacy of affections. Eccl. 2.21.18,
19. 1. Cor. 7.29, 30, 31. Ecclesiasticus, 7.36. Facile contemnit omnia qui
cogitat se esse moriturum semper. Nihil sic revocat a peccato, quam frequens
mortis meditatio. Mors, and quae in malis habentur, ob oculos tibi quotidie
versentur; sic nihil unquam humile cogitabis ( i. e. to do unworthy things for
worldly ends) nec impense cupies quicquam. Epictetus.

2. Being useful for taking away the fear, terror, and astonishment thereof,
when it come (which we are sure one day must come) which are much lessened by
often premeditation; forewarned, forearm'd. Ab assuetis non fit passio.

2. After this: imagine your self lying on your deathbed taking your leave for
ever of this world, and all things dear to you therein, even of your own Body
for a long time. And 2ly, Going to the place where God's justice shall assign
you, the day of his mercy to you being then expired; and his patience, and long
suffering ended; and our Savior also then ceasing for you his intercessions.

1. 3. Then in order to the first of these [Leaving the World.] Consider

The strange alteration that will then be in your Judgment, and opinion,
concerning all the things of this world; and the extreme vanity and folly of
them; we then speaking like those, Wisd. 5.7, 8. etc. and fruitlesly wishing a
few hours of that now eternally irrevocable time misspent in such vanities,
wherein to fast, pray, and reform our life past.

4. The extreme shortness, and swift passage, that will then seem of your life
past, and of all the worldly contents received therein, (for which consider
that part of your life already past, how short, and how nothing worth it now
seems unto you,) without any present or remaining fruit of them. And that all
the pains of virtuous living then also would have been past, and seemed as
short (to your comfort); and an eternal harvest of bliss, for them, to follow.

5. The sudden parting at once that then must be (without taking the least
thing with you, 1. Tim. 6.7. Psalm. 49.17.) from all things even the most dearly
affected by you in this life. And every thing at that time with so much more
grief forsaken; by how much it was here more affected; and more lively to
resent this, imagine the destraction and horror that would be to you in a
present exile from your Country into some desolate Island.

6. The great uncertainty, or unworthiness, of the inheritors of your goods,
and fortunes: (That great affliction of the wisest of men (See Eccl. 2.18, 19.
Psalm. 49. Ps. 39.6.) And, upon these well weighed, consider the reasonableness
of the Apostles deduction and proposal. (1. Tim. 6.8.)

7. The leaving also behind of your own Body, and beholding your self even
before death stripped, first, of all your beauty, strength, abilities,
perfections thereof, and many times also of your reason, and judgment; And
consider as the decays of it in sickness, so the filthiness, and loath someness
thereof, after death.

8. Upon these consider the fruitfulness, and loss, in that day, of all your
labor spent on your body; or on your worldly estates, and fortunes; except
only, what was done in relation to God's service. This in order to the first:
you leaving the world.

2. 9. In order to the second; [your going to a place of bliss, or torment,
which so ever God's justice shall assign you:] Consider

The eyes of the Soul opened by death (as Stephen's were Act. 7.57. or the
young man's, 2. Kings. 6.17.) And all things appearing new unto it (as the
world, or the Sun did, to the man that was born blind. Jo. 9. Or to one, could
he well observe it, that is newly come forth of the womb), and much contrary to
what was formerly imagined; so as things do to one awakned out of a long dream.

10. A doom, or Judgment, upon the Soul immediate after death as appears by
Luke 16.22, 23. comp. 28. -- 1. Pet. 3. 19. -- 2. Cor. 5.8. Phil. 1.23. though
not such as shall be after the day of judgment; God's final judgment upon the
Devil himself being deferred till that day, Jude, 6. much more of the damned
men. But yet supposing the Soul as senseless after death, as the Body, till the
general day of doom, yet that judgment also as if it were immediate, because no
interval of time is perceived by what is utterly senseless.

11. The great uncertainty and doubt your Soul shall then be in what shall
become of it; because of your former not assuredly sufficient repentance,
reformation, etc. and perhaps opinion also that that repentance which you can
then perform is too late. Your hope being then mingled with much fear, unless
perhaps your life has been singularly, and extraordinarily holy.

12. The eternally unchangable condition, after that moment, without any
benefit, of despairing repentance, and everlasting tears.

13. The attendance of good, or evil Angels (according to our life past) by our
bedside to execute God's vengeance upon the ejected Soul (See Luke 12.20.)
[they shall require] 16.22. -- 16.9. Matt. 24.31.40.

14. That as Bodies at the resurrection, so Souls of Saints are treated at
their death; since their Souls at death go to be with Christ ( Phil. 1.23.) as
Bodies at the Resurrection. Therefore as their Bodies then shall be caught up
in the Clouds into the air to meet the Lord, etc. (1. These. 4.17.) so are the
Souls of Saints at death caught up, and carried by Angels into heaven, which
are thought to be signified by those clouds, and a throng of them to have had
the appearance of a white or shining cloud (See Act. 1.9. Matt. 17.5. Luke
16.22.) And if the Souls of Saints at death by good Angels are carried upwards,
in the like manner doubtless are the Souls of the wicked by evil Angels thrust
down into the Eternal prison.

15. The strict judgment that will then be made by God of our whole life, even
to every word, and thought, and that not only on Heathen, or on Christians for
enormous crimes (who are judged already as it were, Jo. 3.18.) but on
Believers, for omitting deeds of Charity, and mercy; or the duties of their
profession, for the not right employing of any Gifts, or goods spiritual, or
temporal bestowed upon them. (Consider Matt. 12.36.37. Jude, 14, 15. Romans
14.11, 12. Phil. 12. comp. 11. -- 1. Cor. 4.4, 5. -- 1. Cor. 3.13. etc. Job.
31.14. Matt. 25.42. -- 25.30.)

16. The fresh review that will be on your deathbed (upon the approach of this
account) or if it be not then, much more desperate our condition; and
immediately after our dissolution it will be so much more:) of all our sins,
especially those more considerable, the suggestions of evil spirits helping the
accusations of conscience, when repentance is too late, for the producing of
despair. Psalm. 50.21. Prove. 20.27. or (which is worse) hiding our sins from us;
or falsely securing the conscience when impenitent upon our Savior's merits, to
the begetting of a vain presumption.

17. The bitter remembrance that will then be of former pleasures not innocent;
and so much the more detestation and cursing of every thing now loved, as we
here took in it more delight.

18. The impossibility of exercising, in that time of sickness, any
reformation, or acts of virtue, contrary to our former sins; except perhaps
some deeds of Charity; which yet is then less acceptable, when we give what we
longer cannot retain, at the least unto our selves.

19. The miserable condition of wicked men at that time beyond that of a beast
that wholly perishes; And here imagine the terrors of Corah etc. when they saw
the earth ready to swallow them up.

20. The pious resolutions of a better life (if God would reprieve us) that we
would then make; and the hearty wishes that all our time here had been spent
otherwise.

21. The exceeding great and comfortable remembrance of any one past good deed.

22. After these things well weighed, which will then certainly happen,
consider 1 The great uncertainty of the time; and that death commonly comes
very secretly (as our Savior has very carefully forewarned us) like a thief,
at a time when we are asleep, and think less of it, than at other times we do.
Now this imagined great distance still from our death chiefly arises from
every ones reckoning his own end, only from deficiency of nature (which yet not
one of 1000 dies of) and not from accidental distempers: when as most commonly
this our lamp goes out (either choked with its own nourishment or violently
extinguished by some external accident) before its. Oil is half consumed. And
since nothing is more common then example of this in others on every side; what
self love, and dotage, is it to promise our selves a better destiny, till we
also surprised become the like example to others?

23. And consider likewise, and think with your self how many are dying in that
very time you are thinking, and meditating of it.

24. 2 When this time shall come; your impotency, and unfitness (from your
fears, your pains; and many times the want of your senses:) that will then be
to order, either the matter of your Soul, or of your worldly affairs: to do any
thing with sufficient devotion, or prudence; and also your friends at that time
hiding from you as much as they can the danger of your sickness. Nay your self,
perhaps when decumbent under the stroke of death, yet removing it a far off
still, and certainly presuming (being loath to imagine the worst) of a
recovery; only because some few, so sick, have not dyed; of whom your unkind
friends will not be wanting to mind you also, because your self formerly have
recovered.

25. For exciting your resolutions, and affections, Endeavor to make the same
judgment of things for the present; and to have the same opinion now of your
sins, of the world, and its pleasures, and its cares, and your designs in it;
and what you imagine you should in such a case (at such a time,) purpose, now
resolve upon.

26. Prepare your self for that terrible and dreadful hour in some of those
Duties set down before.

27. Avoid not, but use and seek out, all the sad memorials of death that may
be; as visiting Hospitals; the sick; sore, and putrefying, dying persons;
hearing their speeches, their groans; looking on the skeletons of the dead,
frequenting funerals. Making many reflections on the passing of time; decays of
your own Body, or other men's etc. Remembering often Eccl. 7.2, 3, 4. Repeating
often the 90 Psalm. Recalling to mind, and keeping a Catalogue (sometimes to be
reviewed) of your friends, and acquaintance deceased. Considering what they
were, did, are. Thus much for Sickness, and Death.

. 169.
For Consideration of the General day of Judgment some more particulars may yet
be added. Consider,

1. That that is the proper day of justice, and wrath; as the present is of
Grace, and Mercy (See Romans 2.5.8, 9. 2. These. 1.7, 8. Rev. 11.18. -- 6.16. Luke
18.7. -- 2. Cor. 5.11.) God's justice upon sin(by Christ's Mediation) being
delayed till that time, that many might come to repentance (2. Pet. 3.9.) and
these his present temporal punishments being inflicted chiefly not for
vengeance, but for other ends; either for their good that suffer, or other men's
that behold it. Therefore the present called our day ( Luke 19.42. -- 2. Cor.
6.2.) wherein our free will does as it pleases. That, the day of the Lord (2.
Pet. 3.10. -- 1. These. 5.2.) wherein removing this free power we yet enjoy, God
will gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and all that do
iniquity, and cast them into the furnace ( Matt. 13.41.)

2. The dreadful signs (that shall be then) of God's wrath, and the
terribleness of the appearance of that day beyond all other terrors; and the
alteration of Heaven, and Earth, and putting out of the Sun (before the sitting
in judgment. Rev. 20.11. comp. 12.) tho not till after the resurrection. 1.
These. 4.16. (See 2. Pet. 3.10.12. Psalm. 18.7. etc. Nahum. 1.3. etc. Esai.
30.27. etc. Matt. 24.29. etc. Rev. 20.11. Joel, 3.2.12. etc. to 17. Zechariah,
14.4. Luke 21.36.

3. As the Bodies of the righteous raised in great beauty, and glory; so those
of the wicked in great filthiness, and deformity.

4. The horrible fear, and trembling of the wicked then living, ( Matt. 30.
Luke 21.25, 26. Rev. 1.7. -- 6.16. -- 11.18. Rev. 1.7.) this day coming upon
them when full of sin, and security ( Matt. 24.12.38. Luke 18.8. -- 21.35. --
1. These. 5.3. -- 2. These. 2, 3.) And of the Souls of the formerly dead then
being brought out of their prisons (1. Pet. 3.19.) and reunited to their
loathsome companion the Body; Now to be sentenced together with the devil to
eternal torments; whom also we may suppose deprecating, as the Devils ( Luke
8.31.)

5. The confidence, and joy of the righteous then living, and of the Souls of
the dead then coming out of the place of rest, and bliss, and reunited to their
Bodies; their Bodies carefully gathered up, and brought together by the Angels,
and such as they are described 1. Cor. 15.42. etc. 2. These. 1.10. both these
being then caught up in the clouds, and having their ascension like our
Savior's; and meeting the Lord (coming in his Glory with his Blessed Angels to
Judgment) in the air (1. These. 4.17. Luke 21.28. -- 1. Jo. 2.28. -- 1. Cor.
7.7. -- 2 Timothy 4.8. Tit. 2.13. -- 1. These. 5.4. -- 2. Pet. 3.12.) whom we may
suppose singing together, as in Rev. 19.6, 7, 8.

6. A particular appearance, and examination, of all the Sons of Adam,
assembled together; Sodom, and Gomorrah in Abraham's time then confronting
Corazin, and Bethsaida in Christ's time etc. And every one giving account of
himself to God; the Counsels of all their hearts being made manifest, and
secrets divulged. Romans 14.10.12. -- 1. Cor. 4.5. Matt. 10.15. Rev. 20.12. Romans
2.16. Ecclesiastes, 12.14.

7. Books kept, containing all men's works, then brought forth, and opened Rev.
12.20.) In which how many sins, never thought of for Repentance, shall be then
brought to our Remembrance for Condemnation? And besides them a peculiar Book
of life (called also a Book of remembrance, Mal. 3.16.) being not of actions,
but only of names i. e. of those who have here served and pleased God; that
none of them might be forgotten, or unrewarded in that day. All the rest who
are not writ in that happy book being abandoned to eternal destruction. ( Exodus
32.32, 33. Phil. 4.3. Rev. 3.5. -- 20.15. Luke 10.20. Jo. 10.28, 29.)

8. The manifestation at that time of God's just judgment (the manner whereof
is set down by St. Paul. Romans 2. from 6. to 17. verse) which shall be upon no
other point, but downright according to works, ( Romans 2.6. Rev. 20.12. Matt.
16.27. etc.) In which works, words ( Matt. 12.37. Jud. 15.) and thoughts ( Romans
2.16.) are contained. According to works; either those that men have persevered
in, without any repentance of them at all, or where any repentance of them has
been (which cancels all the work before it, Ezech. 18.21, 22.) according to the
works done after it; whether these be good, or whether they be evil: which
being evil, and backsliding to our former ways, do again cancel our repentance,
and bring the account also of all our former sins repented of upon us (See
Ezech. 18.24. 2. Pet. 2.20. Matt. 18.23. etc. where, as the Lord forgave to the
servant, upon submission, many talents, so upon his mis-behaviour after this he
recalled him to account for every farthing of those talents before remitted.
See Matt. 5.26.) Now these our works shall be judged according to the several
talents that have been promulgated to us, and which we have lived under;
whether it be that of Christ, or that of Moses: (Where note that the law of
Moses, for a great part of it, not only Morals, but Ceremonials, was revealed
to the holy race from the beginning (See The Benefits of our Savior) who may
be said therefore to have been from the beginning under the law, or under the
Gospel, only obscured by types) or that of Nature. Under one of which all the
Sons of Adam have lived. For it must always be some law (received) that works
wrath ( Romans 15. Jo. 9.41.) because where no law is there is no transgression.
(Therefore See Romans 1.21. comp. 18.24. how wrath was wrought against the
Heathen upon a law.) Some therefore at that day shall be judged by the law and
the words of Christ our Lord, and by the New Testament (See Jo. 12.48.) Some by
the law of Moses, and the Old Testament. (See Romans 2.12. Jo. 5.45.) The rest by
that of nature, which is written in their hearts (See Romans 2.12. comp. 14.)
which law to be given to, and in, all men, the Apostle there proves, from the
testimony of Conscience, and reflex thoughts, in all men, sometimes accusing,
sometimes excusing them, which necessarily presupposes a law ( Romans 2.15.) So
that every one at that day is condemned for evil works committed not only
against the power of that light, and knowledge, which (had it not been their
own default) they might have acquired; but against that light, and knowledge,
which they actually were possessed of, and did not walk according to it: All
condemned for those things, which when they did their Conscience accused them
for ill doing; and therefore which when they did, they might have forborne (for
conscience accuses for none else) and which, some others living under the same
law, (Suppose a Socrates, or a Seneca,) did upon like temptations forbear. So
that all, in that day are condemned ex ore suo. Meanwhile, though extra
Christum there will be no Salvation, no reward, yet that Judgment shall be more
tolerable by much for some offenders than for others: for those who lived under
Moses's Law, than for those under Christ's ( Heb. 2,3. -- 10.28, 29.) for those
under the law of nature, than those under Moses's: for much shall (then) be
required of him to whom much is (here) given: and who knew not so much of his
Lord's will, and so committed things worthy of stripes, shall be in that day
beaten with few stripes (See Matt. 10.15. -- 11.22.24. Luke 12 48. Act. 17.30.
-- 14.16. Matt. 3.10. Heb. 2, 3. Jo. 15.22.) [Which law of nature, and light
given, had any one entirely observed, he should have been saved, i. e. freed at
least from all punishments, as respecting his own actions, (though he would
have stood guilty still of original uncleanness, and must have incurred the
same Condemnation with unbaptized infants,) though he had not been rewarded
with any supernatural beatitude upon the virtue of the first Covenant. Yet so
it is, that though for the single Acts of sin, for some time, those who live
under this law have power to abstain; yet through the depravation of nature,
and contagion of ill Example, and in so much temptation, reason not being
always able to be vigilant without the help of supernatural Grace, it could not
be that any one at all times should perfectly abstain from all; i. e. should do
all which possibly he might.]

9. In this Judgment, the righteous (after that those whose works have been
less pure have first endured the severe trials of the purifying sire of that
day, 1. Cor. 3.15.) first absolved, and separated by our Savior from the
wicked; and placed on his right hand ( Matt. 25.32, 33.) then receiving their
approbation and praise of God (1. Cor. 4, 5.) for all their righteous, works,
and sufferings; and embraced and acknowledged by the Lord Jesus for his sheep,
for his Brethren, before his Father, and all his holy Angels ( Luke 12.8. Rev.
3.5.) and all the world; and so admitted (every man according to the proportion
of his labor, and service here Luke 19.17.) to the reward, and Crowns, and
Kingdom promised: i. e. to be partakers with Christ of his Kingdom over all
things (See Matt. 24.47. Rev. 3.21.) In which Kingdom first taking their
places, and set on thrones (as mercy in that day also will prevent Judgment)
they shall judge with Christ the rest of the world; and that not only men, but
Angels.

10. The General (...), and self conviction of the wicked in that day ( Matt.
22.12. Romans 2.15. comp. 16.) especially shame, and confusion of those that have
professed the name of Christians; who pleading this name ( Luke 13.26.) shall
be denied by our Savior before his Father, and the holy Angels, that he ever
knew them for any of his followers, and then he shall be ashamed of them, as
they of him here (See Mark. 10.38. Matt. 7.23. 1. Jo. 2.28. -- 3.16. etc. Dan.
12.2.)

11. The dreadful sentence ( Matt. 7.23. -- 25.41.) And the outcries of that
day; and the woeful separation; (the most joined being then parted asunder
according to their contrary deserts, ( Matt. 24.40.) the cursed (with weeping;
and gnashing of teeth, to see others in the Kingdom they might so easily have
acquired, and themselves thrust out Luke 13.38.) descending into the abyss, and
land of forgetfulness ( Luke 8.31. Psalm. 88.12.) as the blessed with our
Savior ascending) and being now filled with the perfection of despair, and
left to God's anger, and indignation, and vengeance; which vengeance having
been gathered together in all ages, is now to be poured out in full measure
upon all the sin that ever has been committed since the beginning of the
world, and especially upon all the violence, and wrong done to all his Saints,
by the executing now of all the Curses of the Holy Scriptures upon his, and
their Enemies.

12. The holy Saints, and Angels, no more pitying, no more praying for these
miserables; no more acknowledging any more alliance unto them; but exceedingly
approving Christ's justice, and praising God's vengeance, and triumphing in the
destruction of his, and their enemies, (like those Rev. 11.17, 18. -- 16.5, 6.
-- 19.1, 2.) God himself also laughing at, and having them in derision ( Psalm.
37.13. Prove. 1.26.) and sending them into a land of eternal forgetfulness.

13. After all these: Consider the Paucity of the saved gathered from Matt.
7.13, 14. Luke 13.24. 1. Cor. 9.24. 2. Tim. 2.5. [lawfully] i. e. observing
strictly, the conditions upon which the Crown is given: Matt. 22.14. Romans 9.27.
1. Cor. 1.26. Matt. 19.23, 24. 1. Cor. 9.27. 1. Jo. 5.19. Joel, 2.32. Zech.
13.8, 9 [spoken of the last times] Luke 13.27. And this also may be gathered
from the small number of those saved in the flood, and in the destruction of
Sodom: Types of the last destruction of the world, and of the wicked (2. Pet.
2.5, 6. comp. 9. Matt. 24.38.) And of those entering into the earthly Canaan (1.
Cor. 10.5.) a type of the Heavenly. So in the Parable of the Seed ( Matt. 13.)
which was not sown every where; (where sown) only one part of four fructified.
And experience shows most part of the world to be unbelievers; of Christians,
wicked. Luke 18.8. -- 21.35.

14. For exciting affections; meditate on 2. Pet. 3.11. -- 1. Pet. 1.17. etc.
Luke 21.36.

IV. MEDITATIONS on the unspeakable Joys of HEAVEN.

1. Consider here, that the greatest Saints, and also our Lord himself, have
set before them this Contemplation as a most effective motive to encourage them
against all present labors and hardships. Inclinavi cor meum ad faciendas
justificationes tuas in aeternum, propter retributionem, says Holy David,
Psalm, 118. and Moses esteemed the rebuke of Christ greater riches than the
treasures in Egypt; for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward,
says the Apostle of Him, Heb. 11.26. And our Lord (says the same Apostle,
Ibid. 12. c. 2. v.) for the joy that was set before him, endured the Cross
having despised the shame. And, Rejoice (says our Lord, Matt. 5.12. to his
Disciples) and be exceeding glad, for your reward is very great in Heaven. And
again: In this rejoice not, that the Spirits are subdued unto you: but rather
rejoice because your names are written in the Heavens. Luke 10.20.

2. Consider (to ascend by degrees in the survey of this future bliss according
as the Scripture, in many fair Metaphors, and Similitudes, has represented it
unto us) first at the resurrection the contemptible dust of these our vile
bodies, wherever scattered and dispersed by the four winds, carefully gathered
together again by God's holy Angels.

He shall send his Angels, and they shall gather together his chosen from the
four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. Matt. 24.31.

The harvest is the end of the world: the reapers be the Angels. Matt. 13.39.

Raised again by the love and affection to us

Of our omnipotent and dearest Savior

And this is the Fathers will, That of all which he has given me, I should
lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day etc. And -- I will
raise him up at the last day. Jo. 6.39, 40.

And of God his and our Father.

For if we believe that Jesus dyed and rose again, even so them also which
sleep by Jesus, will God bring with him. 1 Thessalonians. 4.14.

Raised again by the sound of the Trumpet, signifying our Lord's approach
before, or together with, the change that shall be of the Saints also then
living, who then shall be caught up into the air, and saved from the last flood
of Fire that shall destroy the world, as righteous Noah and his Sons were from
the flood of Water that destroyed it. See Matt. 24.36.40, 41. comp. Luke 17.37.
-- 2. Pet. 3.6, 7, 12. -- 1 Thessalonians. 4.16. -- 1. Cor. 15.52. -- 2 Thessalonians. 2.1.
These bodies then not built of corruptible flesh and blood:

Now this I say, That flesh and blood cannot possess the Kingdom of God. 1.
Cor. 15.50. See 1. Cor. 6.13.

But made like unto the Angels of God in heaven. Matt. 22.30. Act. 6.15.

Raised not in dishonor but in glory. 1. Cor. 15.43. not in weakness but in
power:

Immortal, Spiritual, 1. Cor. 15.44.

Celestial, verse. 40.

being an house of God. -- An house from heaven, 2. Cor. 5.2.

bearing the image of the heavenly 1. Cor. 15.49.

Fashioned like unto the Son of God's glorious body; Who will reform our vile
body that it may be configured to his glorious body, Phil. 3.21.

Glorious not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and unspotted,
Ephesians. 5.27.

Like our Savior whatever his Glory is, 1. Jo. 3.2. Sons of God in a glory and
fashion suitable to this Title Luke 20.36. by being then Sons of the
Resurrection. And Adoption and Redemption of our Body (says the Apostle) which
as yet we groan and wait for. Romans 8.23. -- 2. Cor. 5.2.

These Eagles gathered together where our Lord is: and our Bodies caught up (as
his was) in the clouds to meet our dearest Lord in the highest regions of the
air; and so to be ever with him, 1 Thessalonians. 4.17.

Descending with him coming to Judgment; and there after our receiving an
Absolution before the Tribunal of Christ, (through the application of his
merits to all his members informed with his Spirit) and after the sentence
[Venite Benedicti!] sitting together with him or standing about his Throne in
his passing Judgment upon the wicked, Angels and Men. 1 Thessalonians. 4.14. Matt.
19.28. -- 1. Cor. 6.2.3. -- 2 Thessalonians. 1.1.8.10.

Now all things made new Rev. 21.5. A new earth and a new heaven, wherein
inhabiteth [no more sin but all purity and] justice created for them. 2. Pet.
3.13. And this new world enlightened by the glory of God himself, Rev. 21.23.

We here made partakers of the lot of the Saints in Light, Col. 1.12.

Admitted to have fellowship with all the just men that ever were consummated
and made perfect, Heb. 12.22.

Coming to the general Assembly and Church of the first born, Heb. 12. Made
fellow-citizens etc. Ephesians. 2.29. Sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Matt.
8.11.

To an innumerable company of Angels. To Jesus the Mediator, Heb. 12.24. Now
making up altogether the measure of the stature of the fullness and compleatment
of our Savior's Body, Ephesians. 1.23. -- 4.13.

To see him now as he is, 1. Jo. 3.2.

That God may be all in all, 1. Cor. 15.28.

Next view the City where this Society of Saints live. A City of most firm
Foundations not to be shaken, whose builder and maker is God himself, Heb.
11.10. -- 12.28. -- 8.2.5. In a better country the heavens, Heb. 11.16. And
those made anew for the purpose, Rev. 21.1. Allusively described and painted to
our imaginations by the most glorious and perfect things that here fall under
the knowledge of sense, Rev. 21, and 22. Chapters.

The City made in fashion of a Cube the most stable figure, Rev. 21.16.

The streets of it pure Gold, as it were transparent Crystal, Rev. 21.21.11.
-- 4.6.

The Foundations garnished with all manner of precious stones, See Rev. 4.3.
Jasper, Sapphire, Emerald, etc. ver. 19.

The walls of Jasper, clear as Crystal, etc. ver. 18.11. these stones too
having the glory of God (ver. 11.) shining upon them.

The 12. Gates, 12. Pearls, Every several Gate of one Pearl.

These always standing open because never night, freely to receive all nations
(ver. 24, 25.) And at the 12 Gates 12 Angels to guard them, that nothing
abominable or defiling enter in there at: But only those that are written in
the Lambs Book of Life, Rev. 21.27.

1. Within it a pure river of water of life proceeding out of the Throne of
God, and of the Lamb, Rev. 22.1. In the Piazza of the City, Paradise watered
with its streams, ver. 2. and in it the tree of life exposed, always bearing
fruit, and ever flourishing with an unfading leaf, having the cure of all evils
in the leaves, the yieldance of all delicacies in the fruits, and variety of
these for every month. See ver. 2.

2. The Glory of God and of the lamb not resident in one part of the Temple as
formerly, but the Temple thereof, Rev. 21, 22.

And the glory of them likewise the Sun thereof, ver. 23. [For what other light
can transcend that of the glorified Saints, who themselves shine as the Sun.]

All things there Holy. Nothing that defiles entering into it, nothing wicked
or abominable, Rev. 21.8.

27. No more Curse or Malediction there, Rev. 22.3. And when you have viewed
the City then look into it, and view once more the inhabitants thereof. All
Sons of Nobles, Kings with Crowns. Triumphant with Palms. Clothed all in white
bright radiating Robes, and shining as the Sun.

Wonder at their endless inviolable Concord. A City at unity in it self. More
united than Friends, being all Brethren. Then Brethren, being Fellow Members
all of one and the same Body. And more united yet than Members, In as much as
the Spirit of God, by which they are joined, has a more excellent power and
virtue in compacting the Members of Christ, then the Soul has in those of the
Body. By which union it is, that all the honor, glory, inheritance in the
Heavens, which to all of them is but one, is all of it unto every one of them.

Then behold (because the more pleasure arises from the variety of the Object)
not all these Stars of an equal magnitude, but after that nothing seems addible
to the splendour of the first, yet continual ascendent degrees in this sphere of
glory, and other yet higher lights far transcending the former in their luster;
yet so as the glory of the highest is also challenged and owned by the lowest,
as all being but the same Body without all schism, or knowledge of envy, no
more than the foot does the higher place or offices of the hand or the eye.

Behold then here a rising Throne: 1. Of an innumerable company of the common
People of Saints, yet all glorious in Majesty.

Advanced above them, caeteris paribus, the Quire of pure Virgins, that have
remained holy in Body as well as Spirit. 1. Cor. 7.34. See 1. Cor. 6.13. Rev.
14.4.1.

Above these higher yet Holy Confessors.

Above them the White Army of Martyrs.

Yet higher the Society of the [ Luke 13.28.] Holy Prophets, Matt. 10.41.
Evangelists, Patriarchs, Apostles, Luke 22.28. with their Seats round about the
throne of God, Rev. 44.

Higher yet the Blessed Virgin Mother of God, and the most highly favored
amongst all Creatures, Luke 28.30.

Then see the domestic attendance of the Almighty.

Beside his Throne, Rev. 5.11. that winged Host of heavenly Ministers, all
distinguished in a wonderful Order.

Angels, Archangels, Powers, Dominions, Thrones, Cherubims, Seraphims,
And the seven Spirits of God, the seven Lamps of Fire, burning always before
the throne, always standing in his presence, Zach. 4.10. Rev. 4, 5. -- 5, 6.
Luke 1.19. Dan. 10.13. Rev. 1.4. -- 8.2.

Lo yet higher in the midst of the Throne of the Almighty Rev. 5, 6. above all
the family of Heaven and Earth, sitting on the right hand of the Majesty in the
highest far above every name that is named, not only in this world but in the
world to come, Ephesians. 1.21. Upon whose Vesture is written King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords, Rev. 19.16. at whose name the knees of all things bow, etc. Phil.
2.10. Angels, and Authorities, and Powers being made subject unto him 1. Pet.
3.22. to whom it was an honor to see him, and who had a great desire to look
into the mystery of his Redemption, being God manifested in the flesh; in whom
the manifold wisdom of God before hidden, was made known unto them by the
Church: And lastly, who gave them a nearer, and more honorable relation unto
the Divinity, being now gathered together with us into one Body under him their
Head, 1, Pet. 1.12. -- 1. Tim. 3.16. Ephesians. 3.10. Col. 1.20. -- 2.10. Behold this
Person, I say, not an Angel, but a Man, Jesus our Glorious Redeemer, making us
now equal to those perfect Spirits, our flesh, nature, image, above them. Him
glorious and admired by all his Saints in that day, 2 Thessalonians. 1.10. Described,
Dan. 10.6. Rev. 1.13, 14. Rev. 4.8. Shining as fine metal burning in a
Furnace, his countenance as the Sun shining in his strength. Blessed are they
of whom in that day of his Glory he will not be ashamed.

And lastly, see the employment and action of this heavenly Quire mixed of Men
and Angels, but under the presidence of a man. It Is perpetual music, and
singing new Hymns of Victory and Triumph, Rev. 5.8, 9. -- 14.3. -- 15.3. Every
day a Sabbath, and they in it resting from all labor and celebrating Divine
Service. Never ceasing all this long day of Eternity (for there is no night,
Apoc. 21.15. -- 22.5.) from their Doxologies, holy, holy, holy, etc. They rest
not day and night, saying, etc. Apoc. 4.8. [for what can they do, that are
always ravished with joy, but always praise the Author thereof.] falling down
and worshipping, Rev. 5.14. and casting down their Crowns before the Almighty
with a Dignus es etc. in admiration of his wisdom and thankfulness for this
their happiness, Rev. 4.11. Ravished with the sight of their God, and burning
with an equal love one toward another. O how shall we sing the Lords song in a
strange land. Psalm. 137.4.

O si vidisses sanctorum in coelo coronas perpetuas etc. Scribe, lege, canta,
geme, tace, ora, sustine contraria: Digna est his omnibus and majoribus
praeliis vita aeterna. Kempis, 3. l. 47. c.

. 172.
V. HEADS for the Meditation on the BENEFITS of Almighty God to YOU, and to all
MANKIND.

V. Psalm. 40 5. Many O Lord etc. They cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee?
1. First consider the greatness of his person, his infinite majesty, glory,
beauty, power, wisdom, mighty works; helping your thoughts with some
description, or vision of him, in the Old or New Testament. This consideration
of his greatness, with a little reflection on your vileness ( Psalm. 8. 3, 4. --
144.3, 4. -- 113, 5, 6, 7. -- 1. Chron. 16, 17.) will make much for
aggrandizing of any favors from him, such a one, to such a one, as you.

2. Consider his Benefits; His Creating you so perfect in Body, and Soul. In
his own image, and likeness. The noblest but one of all his other Creatures.

3. Creating, all other Creatures for your use; and in them abundant
sufficiency for all your needs; Even the Angels (more excellent than you) for
your guard ( Heb. 1.14) and protection.

4. Preserving you thus created in your being ( Act. 17.28.)

5 Giving you, 1 many particular deliverances, and preservations temporal, from
many evils happening to others (as diseases, poverty, many casual, and
quotidian dangers, etc.) (Here calling diligently to mind any misery lying upon
any of your acquaintance; and remembering that your sins have also (perhaps
more) deserved it: thanking God that you are preserved from it.)

6. 2 Many particular blessings temporal, denied to many others (as health,
riches, honor, long life, etc.) he having provided all necessaries for you;
and doing good to you, all the while that you have done nothing but offended
him, even perhaps as long as those, Psalm. 95.10.

7. 3 Deliverances, and preservations spiritual, from the Devil, and his evil
Angels day and night seeking your destruction, and that by the continual
defense of the Good. From many great temptations; Preserving you in your right
wits; Keeping you from despair.

8. 4 Blessings Spiritual, such as follow,

Memorandum, in these four last; That you exact of your memory a very
particular account; Reviewing very narrowly your life past; passing orderly
through your childhood, youth, from the time of your first remembrance; and
confessing unto him.

. 173.
1. Giving you laws; wherein he only commanded you things exceeding beneficial,
and forbad you things exceedingly hurtful to your public and private good.
Laws not grievous: but an easy yoke, and a light burden (1. Jo. 5.3. Matt.
11.30.) to those that are exercised therein. Teaching you in all things (out of
his infinite wisdom) what you should do, and, what you should refrain; and
giving you (within you) a vigilant, and tender Conscience, to accuse, or
approve you, according to your doings.

2. Making you most gracious promises upon obedience to his will, and following
his counsels; and again grievously threatening you upon contempt of his laws,
and these promises. And using all possible means (your liberty being reserved,
and your will not forced) to wean, and fright you from the ways of death, and
allure you to the ways of life.

3. Redeeming you (after that in your natural condition you became
dis-obedient) when without strength ( Romans 5, 6) when a sinner (ver. 8.) when
an enemy (ver. 10.) from sin, death, satan, hell, (into whose cruel hands you
were fallen) by his own Son: Him that was brought up with him, his daily
delight ( Prove. 8.30.) sent out of his own bosom ( Jo. 1.18)

-- Even by him [God that made the world] to be given up to death, to be hanged
on the tree, for you, and in your stead. Remitting all your Sin gratis for his
sufferings; without requiring of you so strict an account for offenses, how
grievous soever, committed in the time past before you were, by the receipt of
the stronger iluminations of his Spirit, converted unto him.

4. Calling you (by being born, according to his good pleasure, in a Christian
Commonwealth) to Grace, i. e. To the hearing of his holy word: To the use, and
benefit of his holy Sacraments (the sure pledges of his love, and seals of the
future performance of all his promises, of remission of sin, of increase of
Grace, etc.) (...) To the guidance, and assistance of his holy Clergy: To the
Example of many holy Saints.

5. Having long patience, and forbearance with you, whilst, notwithstanding
these, you continued still vicious; ready to be reconciled whenever you would
return unto him, and with all patience waiting for your repentance, and himself
practicing most exactly toward you all the rules of long-suffering, and
forgiveness, which he has enjoined you toward others.

6. In your Conversion preventing you with his Grace; regenerating and making
you a new Creature after the image of his Son, by infusing into you a new
principle, the Spirit; which remains in you during your whole life; and
sufficiently enabling you in all the parts of holiness, if you be not wanting
to it on your part.

7. Giving you day by day many illuminations, divine inspirations, and
admonitions; and by his Grace in you making you capable of, and rewardable with
new mercies unto you.

8. Ordaining you after a few days spent here on earth to an immortal
condition, and unconceivable joys in heaven, and to have this your vile Body,
after its corruption, raised again in great glory, and beauty.

. 174.
9. Affections, and Resolutions: Such as these 1. Admiring his Goodness: --
Your Ingratitude. 2. Sorrow for ever having offended him. 3. Re-loving him. 4.
Endeavoring hereafter to serve him. 5. Suffering any misery for him. 6.
Imitating his goodness to you in yours to others etc.
For Considerations are easily multiplied.

. 175.
VI. HEADS for Meditation on the Several Offices, and Benefits to Mankind, of
Jesus Christ our Lord, extracted out of the larger Discourse of our Savior's
Benefits.

Consider,

1. The world being full of ignorance, and sin; Jesus Christ, 1. Law giver and
Apostle. The Truth.
the holy one of God in the fullness of time anointed by the Father, and sent
into the world. A new Lawgiver; ministering not the letter of the law, but the
Spirit. An Apostle preaching the Gospel; Remitting Sins; Conferring the Holy
Ghost; having the Keys of, and admitting some into, and shutting others out of,
the Kingdom of Heaven. And who before his necessary departure ordained others
(by succession of Ordination to be continued to the world's end); Sending them
as the Father sent him; delivering over his doctrine; and delegating his
authority, and embassy, and keys unto them; and unto the end of the world from
heaven assisting their Ministry, Matt. 28.20.

Appellations relating unto this Office; Shepherd, Pastor, Bishop, 1. Pet.
2.25. -- 1. Pet. 5.4.

. 176.
2. After thus teaching the Way of life: Christ the Exemplar, and Pattern to
mankind, in his life, and death, The Way. 2. Exemplar.
of all obedience to God's commands; and of all suffering for righteousness
sake, which God has here required. And in his Resurrection, and Ascension, of
the reward which God has (for hereafter) promised.

. 177.
3. God's former Covenant of Works being found unprofitable unto us, 3.
Mediator.
upon the breach thereof now liable to God's wrath and eternal death, Jesus
Christ the Mediator of a new Covenant, and Testament, founded in remission of
sins, reconciling sinners to God. Sealing this Covenant with his Blood (the
blood of the New Testament ( Luke 22.20): and ratifying this Testament with his
death; and after his Resurrection having put into his own hands, by the Father,
the donation of the rewards promised to those that keep the conditions of this
Covenant.

. 178.
4. God's justice not pardoning Sin gratis, Christ the Sacrifice, 4. Sacrifice.
the lamb of God, the true sin-offering for the world, expiating our guilt; and
our passover delivering us ( sprinkled with his blood, Heb. 12.24.) from the
destroying Angel. And our peace offering, by eating whereof we have Communion
with God; with his Son, and all that is his; with the Saints, and all that is
theirs. Lastly, by eating whereof, being the Bread of Life, our Souls, and
Bodies, are preserved unto everlasting life, as in paradise they should have
been by the tree of life.

. 179.
5. Man being indebted to God's justice, by him unsatisfiable; and in bondage
to sin; 5. Redeemer
to the law; to death; and to Satan, the grand Executioner of God's justice,
and Prince of this lower world; Jesus Christ the Redeemer, by paying a ransom,
freeing us from our debt; and, by making a conquest, delivering us out of our
slavery. By whom we are freed already from the dominion of sin, from the
condemnation of the law, from the chains of Satan, from the approach of death
eternal, from the hurt, and therefore from the fear of death temporal, that
being now only a passage to happiness. But, when the good time is come, shall
be by the same Redeemer, yet more perfectly freed from all these, than as yet
we are; namely from any adherence, or possibility of sin; from any temptation
of Satan, from being restrained to any law, from being capable of any
mortality, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

. 180.
6. God making a Covenant with the first Adam (made of the earth) involving his
seed; 6. Second Adam. The Life. 1. Cor. 15.45.
and he by his pride transgressing it, so both losing the reward, and bringing
death, both on himself, and his posterity: Jesus Christ the second Adam,
descending from heaven, assuming our nature, entering a Covenant, involving his
seed; fulfilling it by walking a contrary way to the first, i. e. by humility;
and so receiving the reward for himself, and for his seed; Both the holy
spirit, and immortality (which were lost by the first Adam) being now in their
due time restored unto them. Men now being translated from their former stock,
and becoming his seed; by the derivation upon them (first repenting, and
believing) of this nature, i. e. the spirit; which by little, and little
produces in all such, the perfect image of this their second Father. This
spirit first working that image in the Soul; in all Graces planted there like
to his. Secondly in the Body (hereafter) in all corporal glory, and perfection,
like to his; when they also like him shall be the sons of God; Heirs, etc. He
for this effect instituting two Sacraments; the one of Remission, and dying to
our former life of sin, (as we were Children of the former Adam;) and then of
our beginning to be born again, and shaped after the image of the new Adam. The
other of our nourishment in a new life to righteousness, and of our union to
the second Adam.

. 181.
The several Relations (mentioned in Scripture) of our Savior Christ to us, as
second Adam.

1. Father, Children. 2. Husband, Wife. 3. Head, Members. 4. Root, Branches. 5.
Foundation, Building.
6 Elder, and Younger Brethren, in respect of God now our common-Father. In
which respect our Savior is called also the firstborn; the first fruits.
Hence all things done by him, accounted to be done by us; received by him, to
be received by us; done, and given to him, to be given, and done to us. -- And
so things done to us, to be done to him. So we now dead to sin ( Romans 6.1.) to
the law ( Romans 7.4. Col. 2.20.) to the world, i. e. the affections thereof. (
Gal. 6.14.) now risen ( Col. 3.1.) now ascended, and sitting in heavenly places
( Ephesians. 2.6.) Sons of God, Heirs, Gal. 3.27. Matt. 25.40.45.

. 182.
7. The Holy God not admitting in his service the approach of common sinners;
7. High Priest, and Intercessor.
but only of some chosen, and consecrated person for them, and in their stead;
and Aaron's Order, who were themselves also sinners, being therefore (unless
typically) useless, and unserviceable; Jesus Christ was the true Priest after
the perfectest Order Melchizedechical, i. e. Regal, and Eternal. This Priest
(after he was first made like us, in our nature, that he might officiate for
his brethren; and in the infirmities thereof, that he might be more
compassionate in his Office) First offering the Sacrifice; a sin-offering:
Secondly, after the entering into the true and heavenly Sanctum Sanctorum,
carrying in thither the sacrifice; and there now sprinkling the blood thereof
before the Lord, and making Intercession for the sins of the people:
Intercession, both in presenting his own prayers to the Father for us; and also
in presenting our prayers, and oblations to the Father; and in procuring our
admission to present them to the Father at the Throne of Grace our selves, only
this always to be done in his name. Thirdly, By this his intercession procuring
us the descent of the Holy Ghost from the Father ( Jo. 16.7. -- 14.16.) and all
blessings spiritual, and temporal; which blessings himself also from the Father
confers upon us, as having a Priesthood Royal; (in respect of which Regality
as he is, like Aaron, a Priest; so, like Moses, and Joshuah, the Captain of
God's people; going before them into the celestial Canaan, and their
forerunner into the place of rest.) Fourthly, Substituting others in this
office (in his own necessary absence) here on earth; both to present ( here as
he in heaven) the same sacrifice; and to make intercessions for the people:
Till, in the consummation of all things, he returning again out of the heavenly
sanctuary ( Heb. 9.28.) shall give the complete blessing (even eternal
salvation) unto the people: when also all his brethren (like him) shall be made
Kings, and Priests, and serve God for ever in his most holy Temple.

. 183.
8. The son of God always the Lord, and King: by whom (before his Incarnation)
God the Father created, 8, King.
and afterward sustained, and governed, the whole world, (and more especially
the Church,) from the beginning. But man being also partly at his first
Creation possessed of a dominion; and partly upon his obedience through many
temptations being promised yet a higher advancement; and losing by his sudden
dis-obedience, both what he had, and what he had hopes of: This eternal King in
pity to man, and zeal to the reparing of his Fathers Glory descended from his
throne divested of all his Glory and Majesty, and became man of the meanest
fashion; and by his obedience, and sufferings (the way prescribed to attain it)
regained this Kingdom in his humane nature: and so by him shall as many of
Adam's Posterity, as truly follow the Example he has showed them. In which
Enterprise, for a reward of his great humiliation, the man Christ Jesus is now
advanced above all principality, and power; has absolute dominion given him
over all Angels, good, evil; Men, good, evil; over souls, and bodies; the
living, and the dead; over all the Creatures; and is to be the last Judge of
all men, brought back again into life, to stand before his dreadful Tribunal:
Of Angels, the bad; and also the good, for the increasing at that time of their
glory; for their good service to man, correspondent to the increasing, at that
time, of the torments of the evil for their mischievous endeavors against
God's Creatures: the great Arbitour of bliss, and torments, and at that time
the maker of a new world. Meanwhile exercising this his absolute dominion, and
power; by certain degrees (not all at once) according to his infinite wisdom.
1. Both in subduing his enemies; where he first destroys the first Beast. 2.
Then the second Beast, (or image of the first Beast revived) together with the
false Prophet (or Antichrist) that is joined with him ( Rev. 19.20.) 3. Then
Satan ( Rev. 20.10.) 4. Last of all, Death it self ( Rev. 20.14. -- 1. Cor.
15.26.) 2. And in the enlarging of his dominions; which he extends: 1. To the
Jew, and to them in part only: 2. Then to the Gentile. 3. Then upon their
fullness come in ( Romans 11.25.) to the Jews in their whole Body: and so at last
perfectly reigning in his members here on earth, ( i. e. for the outward
profession of the Gospel) in the full harvest both of Jew, and Gentile; all
Kingdoms, or States, opposing the Gospel being quite subdued. After which the
number of God's Elect being accomplished, and just punishments, and rewards, at
the general resurrection distributed, he shall resign his Kingdom to the
Father; when both himself (as Man) and all the rest of the Sons of God shall be
fully perfected, by God becoming all in all (1. Cor. 15.23.)

. 184.
9. Consider,

Lastly, All these Benefits of our blessed Savior common to all Generations
(the one looking forward, the other backward upon them) ever since the fall, i.
e. since the time they first needed a Savior. From which time God has ever
had a peculiar Church separate from the rest of the world. Of which Church the
Son of God was, in all times, the more special Protector, Patron, and
Governor; and the Holy Ghost (ever) illuminating, and sanctifying the members
thereof. With which Church was always established the same Covenant of Grace in
Christ; the same Sacraments for the substance; the same way of Salvation, under
the same precepts, through the like obedience, and sufferings; upon the same
promises, and threats; of the same rewards and punishments (See Heb. 11.) Hence
ever since the fall we find, in the sacred Story, as one Generation the
Children of Works and born after the flesh, (as Cain, Lamech, Came, Canaan,
Egypt, Babylon, etc.) so another the Children of Faith, (first Abel Martyr,
then Seth, Father of the whole Race, Enos, Enoch, Noah, Shem, Abraham;) to whom
the Gospel was more fully preached, and the Covenant of Faith published 430
years before the promulgation of the Law, etc. See all these things prosecuted
at large in the forementioned Discourse.

. 185.
The Love, and Power, of the Father, and the Son.
VII. HEADS for Meditation on the several Offices, and Benefits to MANKIND, of
the HOLY GHOST.

The Holy Ghost, the Eternal Spirit of God; The intimate Communion, and Love of
the Father, and the Son, the Finger of God; the Strength, and Power of the
Father; as the Son is the Wisdom of the Father; the omnipotent worker of all
that which the Father decrees, and which the Son, the word of the Father,
commands.

. 186.
The Spirit of Promise.
The Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit of Promise; who as the Son was a long time the
Promise of the Father to this lower world, so after the exhibition of our
Savior, this Holy Spirit was a further promise unto it, both of the Father,
and of the Son; and at last, upon the departure of the Son, came down from
heaven to abide and dwell with us here on earth, in our Lord's absence, until
his second coming: who as the Son was sent by the Father into the world, to
glorify the Father, and to teach men what he had received and heard from the
Father, so the Holy Spirit descended to glorify the Son, and to teach, and
bring to our remembrance, to confirm, and bear witness here on earth, to all
things that were taught, and heard, and received from the Son; who was here
pleased, not only to be cohabitant with us, but an inhabitant within us; and
vouchsafed to lodge in our persons, as the Son did before to dwell in our
nature; making these our Bodies now the Temples of the Holy Ghost: By whom also
both the Father, and the Son do dwell with us, and in us: who put the last hand
unto the great affair of our Salvation, finishing the internal work thereof
upon us in our Sanctification; as our Savior did before the external for us in
our Redemption.

. 187.
The Spirit of Regeneration.
The Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Regeneration; who by his unspeakable power, does
work the strange work of our second Nativity: who is the seed of God, by whom
we are new Creatures; by whom we are begotten, and born again; born of God, and
made partakers of the Divine Nature, and Sons of God: who is the heavenly
principle, derived into us from the second Adam, Lord from Heaven; conveying
into our Soul Holiness, and into our Body Immortality, and Life; as the flesh
we received from the first Adam conveyed unto us, sin, and death: Who being the
same Spirit in us, that also is in Christ, is the bond of that mystical union
between Jesus the Head, and us the members; and between us, and all other
fellow members; making all Christians but one and the same Body, of the same
temper, of the same inclinations, of one heart, and one mind, amongst our
selves, and with the head, as being all actuated, and moved by one and the same
Spirit.

. 188.
The Spirit of Illumination.
The Holy Ghost conveying its gracious Influences, and Effects, both into our
Souls, and into our Bodies: Into our Souls, both in our Understanding, and
Memory, and in our Will, and Affections. In our Understanding, and Memory, The
Spirit of Illumination; who, being the Spirit of God, and knowing all the deep
things of God, as a man's Spirit does the things of a man, (when as we by
Adam's fall, do remain miserably blinded, and darkened in our Understanding;)
does reveal unto us all the supernatural mysteries of our Redemption, and
Salvation, and produces in us a lively faith, and credence of things not seen:
who bears witness within us to all the doctrine of Christ, to the truth of
the Gospel, and to all the promises, and threats thereof; by whom it is that we
call Jesus Lord: who is the Spirit of Truth, to guide us into all Truth; by
whose unction we know all things beneficial to us, and are every one taught of
God; from whom, those who are his more diligent, and worthy servants, receive
manifold revelations, visions, illuminations, both in things of spiritual and
temporal concernment, both for their own edification, and the edification of
others; knowledge of the mysteries of Religion, and of the deeper sense of the
word of God; knowledge of things to come, of the secrets of the heart; of
things done in absence, and at the remotest distance: The word of Wisdom, and
Counsel; the gift of Eloquence, and powerful persuasion: Wisdom in Offices,
and Governments. The Holy Spirit, distributing unto men these several Gifts, as
seems good unto him, and fit for the work wherein he imploys them; And all
our science being much perfecter, and directed to nobler ends, when this
conferred by the Holy Spirit.

. 189.
The Spirit of Love. Toward God.
The Holy Ghost, in our Will, and Affections the Spirit of Love: Of Love, first
toward God; and also toward our Neighbor. Toward God, who does inflame us
with an impatient love of God, and things Divine; who (according to the promise
under the Gospel) writes all God's laws in our heart; and inclines our will
to obey his Commandments no more out of constraint, and fear, but out of
choice, and affection: who dictateth to us all our acceptable prayers to, and
acceptable praises of, God; and leads the greater proficients in God's
service into a perfect contemplation of, and union with him. Elevating them
with rapts, and ecstasies, and consuming the Soul with the flames of Divine Love.

. 190.
Toward our Brethren.
The Holy Ghost, the Spirit of love to our Neighbor: Who does inflame us with
a most ardent love toward our Brethren: whose blessed fruits are love, peace,
long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, meekness; by whom the Saints are rendered
kind, not envying, not vaunting themselves above others, not seeking their own,
not easily provoked, thinking no evil, bearing all things, believing all
things, hoping all things, enduring all things. Who teaches us to keep our
Savior's new Commandment of Love, and bestows on us this most excellent gift
of Charity.

. 191.
The Spirit of Corporal Parity, and Mortification.
The Holy Ghost conferring its gracious effects and influences, as on the Soul,
so on the Body; In it, The Spirit of Mortification, and Chastity. Who
continually warreth against the flesh, and delights in the severest
afflicting and subduing thereof; especially takes pleasure in its Purity, and
Chastity; and eminently opposes all uncleanness, and those risings of
Concupiscence, which sin, first, discovered in our first Parents. Who also
continually warreth against this world; opposing the vain shows of this present
life, with the representation, to the eye of Faith, of the Glories of that to
come. Who also fights against Satan; and being stronger than he, has cast
him out, and possessed his house; from whose gracious descent, upon our
Savior's ascension, this evil Spirit has suffered a great restraint of his
former delusions, by his Oracles being silenced, and Idolatry destroyed.

. 192.
The Internal Intercessor, and Advocate
The Holy Ghost, the Paraclete our Intercessor, and Advocate, here on earth
within us to the Father, and as the Son is in heaven with God; Who helps our
Infirmities, not knowing what we ought to pray for, and makes intercession
within us, for us, with groans that cannot be uttered: Who makes intercessions
according to the will of God; because he knows the deep things of God; and
God that searches the heart knows the secret mind of this Spirit: Who cries
in our hearts, Abba Father, and teaches us to pray; by which Spirit all our
Prayers must be offered, as they are offered through the Son, that we may find
any access unto the Father: Who abiding here on earth with us, is the effectual
Reconciler, and maker of our peace, for any sins which we commit, whether
against the Father, or the Son: But when we sin against him also, and make him
depart from us, we are desolate; since there is no person any more left, that
can acceptably sue, or make request for our pardon, without this Spirit.

. 193.
The Internal Comforter.
The Holy Ghost, the Comforter; whose Divine presence renders all sufferings,
not only supportable, but pleasant; that which is contrary to the flesh, being
so much the more grateful to the Spirit; who graciously does afford in all
mortifications, and sufferings, sufficient ability, internal peace, and
spiritual joy: who (freeing us from the former spirit of fear) is the author of
a lively constant hope, and confidence in God; whereby we always rejoice in,
and long, and wait for, that blessed day of our Consummation, and the
appearance of our Savior, that so we may enter into the joy of our Lord.

. 194.
The Spirit of Obsignation, and Unction.
The Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Unction, and Obsignation; an Unction, and a
nointing from the holy one, whereby we are consecrated unto God (as the Lord
Jesus was) and made Kings, and Priests, hereafter to reign under Him, and to
serve Him in his heavenly Temple: who is the Seal of God upon us, that we are
already his adopted Sons, and shall be Heirs of all his rich Promises, in their
due season: who is the Earnest of his Covenant made with us; and first fruits
of the plentiful Harvest to come; by whom we have now a foretast of those
heavenly Gifts, and of the good word, and promise of God, and of the power of
Christ's Kingdom, and of the world to come.

. 195.
The Spirit of Miracles and wonderful Works.
The Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Power and Might; of all miraculous, and
wonderful Works; over all the Creatures, and over all the Works of Nature
(which at first he made) Spiritual, and Corporal; over Satan, and all his
instruments, expelling them, and confining them at pleasure; over all
infirmities, and diseases: Who only does great wonders upon the earth, above,
and contrary to the course of Nature; heals the sick, enlighteneth the blind,
strengthens the lame; restores the withered; multiplyeth food; raises the
dead; freeth the possessed; cures the wounded Soul, and broken Spirit;
sanctifies perverse inclinations, to testify to men, the power, and presence
of God amongst them.

. 196.
The Internal Seed of Immortality.
The Holy Ghost, the Seed of Immortality in our corruptible Bodies, and a
fountain in us, springing up unto eternal life: By whose virtue, and efficacy,
It being here sown in shame, will hereafter spring up glorious; weak, shall
come up in power; natural, shall come up spiritual and angelical: Who dwelling
in this our flesh, will never forsake it, until as it did raise the Body of
Christ our Head from the Dead, so it shall have raised up the Body of us his
Members; and until these Bodies also, by the virtue of this Spirit, shall
ascend like unto his, and be caught up in the Clouds to meet him: Until this
our vile Body, shall be made like unto his glorious Body; and until, as we now
bear the image of the earthly Adam, so we shall bear the image of the heavenly;
into which we shall be changed by the Spirit of the Lord, from Glory to Glory,
till with the Angels, and Saints, the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs,
we be all made one in God, and God all in all. To whom be given all Glory, unto
all Eternity. Amen.

O Holy Ghost the Comforter, we commend to thee our souls and bodies, the
beginning and the end of our lives; give us grace to be heartily sorry for our
sins, for the love of God; and to do true penance for them that we may be
perfectly purified from them before we depart hence out of this mortal body. Of
our selves, O Lord, we are corrupt, and blind in our affections, and desires;
if we rely on our own judgments, easily seduced into error, easily overcome by
temptation. Wherefore to thee, O Holy Spirit, we wholly offer and commit the
guidance of our Souls; defend and keep us thy servants from all evil; teach and
illuminate our minds; strengthen our weak Spirits against inordinate
pusillanimity and superfluous scruples of conscience; and keep us humble, that
we fall not into presumption. Give us a right faith, unmovable hope, and
perfect charity; that we may sweetly delight in thee, and everywhere fulfill
thy will and pleasure, who live and reignest with the Father and Son, one God
world without end. Amen.

O Eternal God, who did send thy Holy Spirit upon thy Church, and did
promise that he should abide with it for ever, let the same Spirit lead us to
all truth, defend us from all sin, enrich us with his gifts, refresh us with
his comforts, and rule in our hearts for ever. And grant, O bountiful Lord, the
Doner of every good and perfect gift, that we may prepare our hearts for his
holy inspirations, may diligently hearken to, clearly discover, believe, and
obey his godly motions; may never quench, never grieve, this Holy Spirit: but
living in him, may by him be sealed to the day of redemption: through the
merits of Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns world without end.
Amen.

O Blessed Spirit, the Almighty Paraclete, the communication, bond, and union
of the Father and Son, the conduit conveying to us all that we receive from the
Father and the Son. The dear pledge and token of our absent Lord until his
blessed return, by whose power all things are enlivened which do truly live;
and whose delight is to reside and converse in the hearts of the simple, which
thou vouchsafest to consecrate as Temples to thy self. Come gracious Spirit,
have mercy upon us, descend from heaven into our hearts waiting for thy
comfort; and so fit us for thine own self, that through the multitude of thy
compassions our meanness may be accepted of thy greatness, and our weakness of
thy strength. Sanctify the temples of our bodies, and consecrate them for thy
own habitation. Make glad with thy presence our Souls that long after thee;
make ready a mansion fit for thy self; adorn thy bride-chamber, furnish thy
resting place with the variety of thy own gifts and graces; drive out from
thence whatsoever is old and fading, renew in us thy own workman-ship, with
beauty incorruptible for ever; convey into us heavenly light, heat and motion,
that having tasted of the heavenly gift, and the powers of the world to come;
we never be seduced by our own, or any evil Spirit, but inspired continually
and lead by thee, may be ready to every good work, and relish those things
which are hidden from the world. Purify our minds by thy holy inspirations,
exhilarate them when sad with thy chaste and innocent joys; lead them, when
going astray, into all truth; inflame them when cold with the fire of thy
charity; and unite them when disagreeing by thy bond of peace. Finally be thou
the tie, whereby we may love the Father and the Son, and the sweet fruition
unto us of the Father and the Son; with whom we worship, and adore thee in the
unity of the same Godhead for ever and ever. Amen.

WE adore thee, O Lord Jesus, with a true and lively faith in the Sacrament of

of thy wisdom and goodness really present: who, at thy departure out of this
world to the Father, left us this Sacrament as a pledge of thy love; that by a
new and admirable way thou might still remain with us, whose delight is to be
with the Sons of men. Cleanse our souls, we beseech thee, from all our sins,
and infirmities; and feed them with the crumbs which fall from thy table, that
we may be filled with the marrow and fatness of thy heavenly blessings: Come
unto us, dear Savior, and heal our sinful souls; feed the hungry, and refresh
the weak. Deliver us from all evil; make us always adhere to thy commandments;
and never suffer us to be separated from thee: Who live and reignest one God
world without end. Amen.

O God, who in this admirable Sacrament have left us a memorial of thy Passion;
grant us, we beseech thee, so worthily to reverence the sacred mysteries of thy
Body and Blood, that we may daily find in us the fruit of thy Redemption: Who
live and reignest in the unity of the Holy Ghost one God world without end.
Amen.

WE adore thee, O Savior of our Souls, eternal word of the Father; true
Sacrifice offered for the sins of the whole world. O most precious treasure
replenished with all delight, the resting place of pure and clean hearts. O
Angelical viand! O Celestial bread! O Eternal word of the Father, which art for
us made flesh, and yet remainest God in the self same person. We confess Thee
most undoubtedly true God and Man, consecrated in a most miraculous manner on
our Altars, to be there given to us, and offered to thy Father for us. Thou art
the assured hope and only Salvation of sinners. Thou art the Sovereign
restorative of those that languish, and the inexhaustible treasure of the poor
distressed Pilgrims. Hallowed be thy name, O most sweet Savior Jesus Christ;
may all thy Creatures sing forth praises and thanksgivings unto thee, for the
love wherewith thou tendrest our welfare by descending from heaven, and
offering up thy pure and innocent Body on the Cross for our Redemption.
Hallowed be thy name, most blessed Jesus, that after thy Resurrection and
Ascension, since thou wast to ascend into heaven, there to sit at the right
hand of the Father, thou vouchsafest to leave us the self same immortal Body as
a memorial of thy departure, and a pledge of thy infinite love thou bear us.
O Lamb of God that take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us, and
grant us thy peace; refresh our Souls with this spiritual and heavenly food,
and comfort us continually with thy graces, that neither in life nor death we
may depart from thee, nor be deprived at any time of thy celestial
benedictions, who live and reignest with the Father and the Holy Ghost in all
Eternity. Amen.

O Most loving Father, who sparedst not thy own Son, but deliveredst him to
death for us all, who if we ask thee Bread will not give us a Stone, or for an
Egg a Scorpion; Behold we offer up unto thee Eternal Father this Lamb thy only
Son, and the infinite merits of his Sacrifice performed on the Cross; and
beseech thee to give us this day our daily bread, bread for the body, and all
necessaries for this present life, whereby we may be the better enabled to
serve thee; but especially the bread of our Souls, the gifts and graces of thy
Holy Spirit, and whatsoever is necessary to strengthen them, lest we faint in
the way that we are walking in toward our heavenly country, where we shall be
abundantly satisfied with the pleasures of thy heavenly table; who live and
reignest with the Son, and the Holy Ghost, one God for ever and ever. Amen.

O Most bountiful Father, who give us from heaven the corn of thine Elect,
and bread of Life; who have sowed them on earth, and laid them up in the
Granary of thy Church, for the feeding of thy children: Grant us frequently to
be refreshed with this bread, yea spiritually at least to receive it daily,
which is so useful for us every day; and that we may be sustained by this
heavenly Viaticum in this our Pilgrimage, that in the strength of that food we
may travel on to the Mount of God, by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

O Father of Mercies, and God of all Consolation; who, in the abundance of thy
infinite Charity, has given us thy only begotten Son; that, whosoever believes
in Him may not perish, but inherit eternal Life; and, that our necessities may
be relieved out of the immense treasure of his Merits: Behold me a wretched
Sinner, tho called by thy mercy into the Society of your Son, now also
partaking of his Body and Blood, and therefore at this instant embracing him in
my Breast, and possessing him as my very self and what is intimately united to
me.

And, as such, in union of that love, wherewith heretofore He gave himself for
us on the Altar of the Cross, and now communicates himself to us in the
Sacrament of the Altar, I offer Him to thee, with all his merits and virtues to
thine everlasting praise and glory, that thou may be perfectly pleased in
him; and that we, who by no action of our own can, by the merits and patronage
of thy most beloved Son may, be completely acceptable to thee.

I present thee, O Holy Father, with that entire Charity, Religion, Humility,
Meekness, Poverty, Patience, and with all other Graces, wherein He excelled,
that whatsoever I want (and what do I not want?) may be through these supplied.

And, since I am unable to return fit thanks for the Favors conferred upon me,
I bring thee all the Praises, which He offered whilst he converst here visibly
amongst men, and which he now tenders thee in glory.

But, whereas I can never satisfy for the Guilts, nor discharge the Debts,
contracted by me; in lieu thereof, I present thee all his labors, fastings,
watchings, weariness, devotions and every thing, in fine, He has done or
suffered from the minute of his Conception in the Womb, to that of his expiring
on the Cross: the distresses, dolors, and torments of his Passion; the Blood
spilt, the Wounds received, and the Death endured, for me.

Lo! This is the Treasure, most compassionate Father, wherein I repose my whole
hope and heart. These are the Riches that must compound for what I owe thee.

O pious Father regard the face of thy Christ, and seeing thy beloved Son, in
whom thou have been always well pleased, is now intimately mine, I humbly
entreat thee to respect me too with the eyes of your mercy. I approach you
under his protection and defense, under the shadow of his merits do I address
unto you; that, you reflecting chiefly on him, may behold me, his slave and
properly, with a benign and clement aspect.

Permit not, I beseech you, the Soul to perish, which so often has, in it
self, entertained your Son, sent into the world to seek and save what had been
lost. Grant me this through your infinite mercy. Amen.

A Collect.
O Lord Jesus, we beseech thee by that love wherewith thou lovedst thine own

Garden; and by the injuries and sorrows which thou feltst, by being betrayed
and sold by thine own Disciple, and bound and led away by the Jews; absolve us
from the bonds of our sins, and bind our Souls to thee by the strongest cords
of love, which can never be loosed O dear Savior, who wast whipped with Rods,
and crowned with Thorns, grant unto us thy servants, that we subduing our
bodies with voluntary chastisements, may be made worthy members under such an
Head. And thou O dearest Lord, who by thy death have breathed into dying man,
whom thou at first createdst, a new breath of life, vouchsafe we beseech thee,
that we who owed our whole selves to thee for our Creation, and again owe all
we are to thee for our Redemption, may no longer now live to our selves, but
unto thee who diedst for us. To whom with the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Ghost, be ascribed all Praise and Glory for ever and ever. Amen.

longanimity, and obedience to those that are set over us; Grant unto us, O Lord,

the Holy Ghost; Grant us, etc.

Temperance, and modesty; sobriety and chastity; a true love of thee, and our

Diligence, and constant vigilance; a hunger and thirst after Holiness; zeal
and fervor of spirit; Christian fortitude, and perseverance to the end; Grant
us, etc.

We sinners beseech Thee to hear us, O Lord:

That being reconciled to God, by the death of Christ, we may present our
selves holy, unspotted, and unblameable before him; that we may walk worthy of
God, in all things well-pleasing, fruitful in good works, and increasing in the
knowledge of God; We sinners etc.

That whatsoever we do in word or deed, we may do all to the glory of God; that
we make not void thy grace, or receive it in vain; We sinners beseech Thee to
hear us.

That we be careful to sanctify our Lord Jesus Christ always in our hearts;
that we seek not our own things, but, before all, the things of Jesus Christ;
We sinners etc.

That looking up to Jesus who suffered, we be not wearied and faint in our
minds; but considering the conversation of the Saints, imitate their faith and
patience; We sinners beseech Thee to hear us.

That, as his Soldiers, we entangle not our selves in the things of this
world; but having food and raiment, we be content therewith; We sinners beseech
Thee to hear us.

That by good works we make our faith and election sure; that we do good whilst
we have time, and faint not, for that we shall reap in due season; We sinners
etc.

That we forbear one another in love, being careful to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace; that we bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill
the law of God; We sinners beseech Thee etc.

That being strengthened in all virtue through the power of his grace, we give
thanks to God with all patience, and long-suffering; We sinners beseech Thee to
hear us.

pure, and unspotted in peace, that we may receive the end of our faith, even
the salvation of our Souls; and in the mean time work out our Salvation with
fear and trembling; We sinners beseech Thee etc.

O Lamb of God, that take away the sins of the world;

O Christ hear us.
Christ give Ear unto us.
Our Father which art in Heaven, etc.

Let us pray.

IN flame, O Lord, our reins, and heart with the fire of thy holy Spirit, that
we may serve thee with a chaste body, and please thee with a pure heart.

O Most gracious Lord, vouchsafe we beseech thee, to direct and order all our
thoughts, words, and works, according to thy blessed will, and to the praise of
thy great Name; conform them according to the perfect example of thy most holy
life and conversation: Who live and reignest with the Father and the Holy
Ghost, one God world without end. Amen.

O God, which justifiest the ungodly, we humbly beseech thy Majesty, graciously
to defend with thy heavenly grace, and assist with thy continual protection us
thy servants relying on thy mercy; that, constantly running in the course of
virtue, we may at length receive the crown thereof, and by no temptations be
withdrawn from serving thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

O Father of mercies, and God of all consolations, propitiously regard the
frailty of our condition, and by thy grace strengthen our endeavors, that,
through thy mercy, we may at length obtain plenary remission of our sins,
constancy in thy holy service, and the reward promised to perseverance; through
Jesus Christ thy only Son our Lord. Amen.

Concerning our SPEECH.
For Governing our Words.
O Almighty Judge of men, who have declared, that for every idle word we must
give account in the day of Judgment, [and by our words we must be justified, or
condemned: and have taught us by thy Holy Scriptures, that he that keeps his
tongue keeps his life:] and that if any offend not in word, the same is a
perfect man: We beseech thee to [set a continual watch before our mouth, and
keep the door of our lips, that we may ever take heed unto our ways, that we
offend not in our tongue, that unruly member which defiles the whole Body, and
sets on fire the whole course of Nature: O Lord] protect, and deliver thy
servants, by thy restraining Grace, and by thy fear, from the many evil and
bitter fruits of this so small a member; from blasphemy, swearing, or taking
thy name in vain; from lying, slandering, backbiting, and speaking evil of our
neighbor; from railing, reviling, flattery, tale-bearing, or disclosing
secrets; from vainglory, and boasting; from praising our selves, or
disparaging others; from ostentation of our own science and wit; from all
filthy and corrupt communication; from jesting, foolish, froward and idle
words, and unprofitable discourse. And Thou who have given this Member, etc.

Thou know, O Lord, who know all our infirmities, how slippery a member
the Tongue is, and how liable we are to some abuse of it, which we are
necessitated so often to use, and have so often occasions ministered unto us of
using it amiss; which also it is not in another's power easily to restrain:
Grant, that we may employ our uttermost endeavors to prevent the manifold
evils thereof; that we may not desire to speak, where we may without loss be
silent, nor utter any thing which becomes not thy servants, for fear of seeming
stupid or ignorant, melancholic, or unsociable: make us swift to hear, and
learn, but slow to speak; not intermedling in every discourse, nor speaking at
all times what we know, but what is necessary; remembering that a prudent man
concealeth knowledge, and that there is more hopes of a fool, than of one hasty
in his words. And, good Lord, endue with such peaceableness and calmness of
spirit, that we may never passionately contend, or dispute to maintain an
unnecessary truth, or to vindicate a small right, or to justify our selves in
slight defamations, or affronts; but may follow the pattern of thy most
admirable silence, O Lord, even in the questioning of thy most innocent life,
and on all occasions vilifying, and humbling our selves, may in our hearts give
the glory only to Thee: Who live and reignest etc.

But thou who have given this member to thy creature Man, as a special
instrument of thy Praise, grant that we may zealously employ it to promote thy
glory, and, when ever occasion is given to vindicate thy honor, to join in thy
praises, and to give thanks, and to speak good of thy Name: O Lord, open thou
our lips, and let our mouth ever show forth thy Praise. And be pleased also so
to sanctify us in our worldly converse, that our Speech may be always with
Grace seasoned with Salt; that we may know how to answer every man, and our
discourse such, as may some-way edify, and minister Grace to the hearers; that
this busy member, being defiled with no filthy or vain communication here, may
be the more hallowed in the world to come, to sing Hallelujahs, Doxologies, and
Thanksgivings for ever and ever, to the Blessed Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost. Amen.

A DOXOLOGY to the Blessed Trinity.
GLory be to the Father of mercies, the Father of Men and Angels, the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ.

Glory be to the most holy and eternal Son of God, the blessed Savior and
Redeemer of the world, the Advocate of Sinners, the Prince of Peace, the Head
of the Church, and the mighty Deliverer of all them that call upon him.

Glory be to the holy and eternal Spirit of God, that searches all things,
even the depths, and hidden things of God, the Holy Ghost, the Advocate, the
Comforter, the sanctifying and life-giving Spirit.

All glory and thanks, all honor and power, all love and obedience be to the
blessed and individual Trinity, one God Eternal.

It is most just and right to praise and to glorify, to worship and adore, to
give thanks, and to magnify thee, the great Maker of all Creatures, visible and
invisible, the Treasure of all good, temporal and eternal; the Fountain of all
life, mortal and immortal; the Lord and God of all things, in heaven and earth;
the great Father of thy servants; the great Master of thy children.

The Heavens, and the Heaven of Heavens, and every Power therein; the Sun and
the Moon, and all the Stars of the Sky; the Sea and the Earth, the heights
above, all the depths below; Jerusalem, which is from above; the Congregation
celestial; the Church of the first born, written in the heavens; the Spirits of
the Prophets, and just men made perfect; the Souls of Apostles, and all holy
Martyrs; Angels and Archangels, Thrones, and Dominions, Principalities, and
Powers; the Spirits of Understanding, and the Spirits of Love; with never
ceasing Hymns, and perpetual Anthems, cry out night and day, (and let the
humble voice of thy servants also be heard amongst them,) saying; Holy, holy,
holy, Lord God of Hosts; heaven and earth are full of thy glory.

The Heavens declare thy glory, the Earth confesses thy providence; the Sea
manifests thy power, and every Spirit, and every understanding Creature,
celebrates thy greatness for ever and ever.

Especially thy miserable creature Man, is bound to praise thee; because thou
made him according to thy own Image; because thou gav'st him the riches and
the rest of Paradise; and when he fell, and broke thy easy Commandment, thou
did not despise his folly; nor leave him in his Sin, but did chastise him
with thy Rod, and restrain him by thy law, and instruct him by thy Prophets;
and at last by the coming of the second person, God the Son into the world,
did renew and repair this thy broken Image; for which praised be the Lord
God Almighty, good and gracious, dreadful and venerable, holy and merciful to
the works of thy hands. Hosannah, blessed is he that comes in the name of the
Lord; Hosannah in the highest, for ever and ever. Amen.

A DOXOLOGY concerning the Ways of God's Providence.


O Lord, how great are thy works, how deep are thy thoughts? Who can utter thy
mighty Acts, O Lord? Who can show forth all thy Praise?

Even from the Creation, thy Power delights to manifest it self, in high and
difficult matters; and thou walk contrary to the wisdom of men.

Thy whole work is to do wonders, and by these thou being invisible in person,
declarest thy presence on the earth.

Thou bring light out of darkness, good out of evil, and strength out of
weakness.

Content, and satiety, out of poverty; and glory and honor out of humility.

True wisdom and knowledge, out of holy simplicity, and self-disesteem; the
greatest consolations and joys, out of adversities and sufferings.

Thou make thy foolishness to be wiser then men, and thy weakness stronger
then men.

By the foolish things of this world, thou confoundest the wise; and by the
weak things of the world, thou confoundest things that are mighty.

By the base and despised, and things that are not, thou bring to naught
things that are.

On the contrary, thou bring scorn and contempt, out of the highest of
pride, ambition and glory; covetousnes, and unsatiableness, out of plenty and
abundance.

Extreme folly, out of secular wisdom, and cunning; and sudden want, out of
ill gotten wealth.

Distraction, out of the fulfilling our desires; and sighing and mourning, out
of secular joys and pleasures.

Thou delightest to take the wily in their own craftiness; and to deceive the
deceivers.

To make his own net, that he has hid, to catch himself; and himself to fall
into the same destruction he has prepared for others.

Thou love to judge men by their own self-condemnation; and to make the
guilty pronounce sentence upon himself.

To punish men by their faults; and to make their own way, and not thy power to
overthrow them.

Out of deep security and confidence, thou bring adversity and trouble: and
death when men think most enjoying life.

When they say, Peace; behold a sudden destruction; and in the midst of War,
behold a sudden Peace.

Thou show strength with thy arm, O Lord; and scatterest the proud man in
the imaginations of his heart.

Thou put down the mighty from their seat; and do exalt the humble and
meek.

Thou fillest the hungry with good things, and the rich thou sendest empty away.

Thou make him who disperseth his goods to the poor, to abound in wealth; and
those who heap them up, to suffer penury.

The Race is not to the swift, nor the Battle to the strong, nor Bread to the
wise, nor Favor to the skilful, nor Riches to the Understanding, but as thou
distributest them, O Lord; to those who depend on thee.

Here repeat the Preface.
and which seems to render him most unhappy.

By his abondoning all things, he comes to possess all things; and by his
desire of nothing, he attains to want nothing.

By his being careful for nothing, but the serving of thee, he becomes provided
of all things by thee, and in his flying from the world, the good things
thereof follow him.

To cross and forsake his own will, he finds the way to true tranquillity of
mind; and to forsake his own reason with dependence on thee, the way to true
wisdom.

To be careless of, and to lay down his life for thy sake, the surest way to
save it, whilst others by seeking to preserve do lose it.

By his humility he attaineth to honor; and in voluntary poverty he finds
content.

He takes pleasure in infirmities, in necessities, in distress; because when
he is weak, then he is strong.

He takes upon him thy yoke, that he may find rest; and leaves all that he
has, that he may receive an hundred fold.

By election of some voluntary sufferings, he procures freedom from much
greater, which others unwillingly do undergo.

He abaseth himself, he mourns, he hungreth and thirsts to obtain a
kingdom, and to be comforted and to be filled.

Because he is wise and knows thy ways, therefore after this manner seeks
he thy blessings and rewards.

Repeat the Preface.
in all perfections, which thou requirest of him; and who is there, who in
love, pity, patience, long suffering, humiliation of himself, remitting of his
due, and laying down his honor, is any way comparable unto thee?

Thou have showed so far thy love even to thine enemies, as to give thine only
Son to death, to save their lives.

Thou make thy Sun to rise on the evil and on the good; and sendest Rain on
the just, and on the unjust, and art kind to the unthankful.

Thou pardonest the most notorious and malicious sinners, even after a million
of times, that they have provoked thee, that thou may show the vastness of
thy mercy and compassion.

Thou aboundest so far in thy long-suffering and toleration even of the highest
offenders, that impatient men report of thee, that there is no God to do
Justice.

In thy corrections thou punishest us much less than we deserve; and when thou
punishest, soon repentest thee of the evil, and withdrawest them often out of
mere pity, before our amendment.

When thy chastisements profit us not, thou ceasest from them, and contendest
not in judgment with us, when we persevere in our wickedness.

Thou art not fond toward thy friends, nor cruel toward thine enemies, as man
is.

Those whom thou most love, for their perfection thou most afflictest; and
who begins to serve thee, must prepare his Soul for temptations from thee.

Thou measurest out temptations according to our ability to bear them, and
those who suffer least are the weakest.

We would make this life for a time of comfort, and thou designest it for a
time of trial.

Thou deliverest thy servants out of troubles, rather then exemptest them from
being at all troubled, and who receives a Consolation from thee, must presently
expect a new Combat; and thou sellest thy Graces for Sufferings.

Thou bring evil upon thy servants, to show more thy power and love to them
in their delivery; and to increase their joy, thou preparest the way thereto
through sorrows.

Thou bring evils on them, from things abroad, to make them more love and
adhere to thee, and by looking on their sufferings also thou increasest thine
own pity, and tender affection toward them.

Contrary to the ways of men, thy great love to humility, causes thee to
converse most with those, who seem most below thee.

Thy most intimate conversation, and most familiar presence is with the poor,
and the sick, the contemned, the weak and desolate: then thou most valuest
them, and drawest near unto them, and love to be with them.

Thou hidest thy secrets from the wise and prudent, and tellest them unto
babes, and such must they become who mean to be thy favorites.

Thou see not as men sees; and that which is highly esteemed amongst men, is
an abomination in thy sight.

Thou art content to receive honor from a few; and that thy wisdom be
justified only of its children; whilst the greatest part of men daily
reproacheth thee: as if there could be no God, that governs such a disorderly
world; or, if any, that thou had given man, no sufficient evidence, in what
way of Religion thou would have him to serve thee.

Thou art blasphemed, and provoked every day, and no Saint ever suffered in his
honor and good name, as thy most pure and holy name does.

No men's actions are so much, or so often blamed as thine; none suffers so much
detraction and calumny, and, being injured and having power, does so long or so
patiently hold his peace.

But in the day of wrath, thy anger is intolerable; according to thy infinite
power, so is thy vengeance upon thine enemies infinite.

Man is astonished at the thought thereof, and cannot comprehend the reason of
thy Justice.

These things thou do and suffer, O Lord, that men may acknowledge and
glorify thy all-excelling holiness and goodness.

These things thou do, O Lord, that man may acknowledge and trust in thy
all-ore-ruling power.

These are thy daily works, and for these we desire to praise thee; and who so
are wise, and will meditate these things, they shall understand the righteous
ways of the Lord.

FINIS.
