HIDDEN THINGS Made manifest by the LIGHT;

In a plain Distinction between CONDEMNATION and TEMPTATION.

Wherein is showed how the righteteous LAW of God is ministered upon the
transgressor, and how it is to be by all received and continued under, through
it, as a Schoolmaster to come to Christ, by him to have the sin done away for
ever.

Also of Temptation, what it is, and how it may be known and discerned from
Condemnation, that out of Temptation Man may be delivered and kept with the
Light of Christ, who was tempted and did overcome.

With a direction to them who profess the knowledge of the truth, and live not
in the power of God, that they may know the entrance within the Vail, where the
Temptations are overcome, and where the foolish Virgins cannot enter.

Given forth for such who say they see, and yet their sin remains; and may be
serviceable to such who can hear and understand the things of God, that those
who are yet blind may no longer put darkness for light, and light for
darkness, as it is written,

Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf th^^ have ears: Let
all the Nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled; who
among them can declare this, and show his former things? Let them bring forth
their witness that they may be justified, or let them hear and say it is truth,

Hidden things made manifest by the Light in a plain distinction between
Condemnation and Temptation.
Concerning the Ministration of Condemnation.
THE World being set in man's heart, and sin being in the world before the
promise was made, which promise was before the Law, by which the sin is
discovered; which sin was in the world before the promise, yet the promise was
before the Law; and yet until the Law come, death reigns over that to which the
promise is, and sin separateth man from God, the which is not clearly seen
until the Commandment (which is Light) is come, the ministration whereof is
condemnation unto MAN, being found in the transgression; the which Ministration
of Condemnation is to pass over all, having sinned; and when this comes, it
finds man in the death, and by it is sin revived, whereby man comes to see a
body of sin, which stands between him and God, so that he is afraid of the
dreadful power of God, ministered forth through the law, to slay him that has
transgressed, the which some coming to see, or in the least measure to feel,
calls it a temptation because it makes him sensible that condemnation
belongs to him, and that all his profession and building upon the promise in
that which the promise was not unto; and seeing that if he lies down to
receive this Ministration, that then all his profession and knowledge, zeal,
wisdom and prayers, (which did arise out of that ground which was cursed by
reason of the sin that was in the world before either the promise, the
profession, or the law) will be all ripped up from him as filthy Rags, and that
his shame and nakedness must appear, as it is written, Every mouth shall be
stopped, and every one shall stand guilty before God, and no darkness nor
shadow of death shall hide the workers of iniquity from the mighty hand of God,
who bring^th to judgment the hidden things of darkness, and rips open the
secret of the heart, so that the most secret sins that ever was committed are
clearly made manifest, and justly charged upon the head of the transgressor,
who stands in enmity to God, who will wound the head of the transgressor, and
plead in righteousness with him in whom the sin is found, though not made
manifest until the time that the Law is come by which it is discovered.

And this Ministration of Condemnation is not a temptation, though many call it
so, who being blind, put darkness for light, and light for darkness; for that
which shows man his sin, does not tempt man to sin, but rather brings man in
fear that he may not sin; for because of sin was the Law added; and the Law was
given after much of the love, preservation, power, deliverances, and the
wonders of the Lord had been seen, and it was given in the Wilderness where
sometime there was want of bread and water, where was Serpents, Scorpions and
many trials; where the figure of him who was to heal the wounded, and take away
the sting of death, and save the life of man, was lifted up on high without
them; the which figure or outward bodily appearance, was prepared by Moses: And
Christ had a body prepared him, both which the carnal eye might see, and the
carnal mind contend about, (even as the Devil about the body of Moses) but the
substance of the figure, Christ the Light, Gods power, being not received
within, in the heart, and so sin (the transgression of the Law) remains within,
and the figure or that which the natural eye did, or may see, was and is looked
upon without; and that without does not take away the sin within; and these
knew not the ways of God who sinned, and at last loathed the Manna (calling it
light bread) in the Wildernerness, even there was the Law ministered; they whose
eyes are open may read and understand.

And where the Law was given forth, there was a Mount, or a high place of the
earth, which then trembled by reason of the dreadful power of the Lord of
Hosts; and beneath or under the Mount was the Seed and Israel of God which was
to keep the Law and Life, [Read within and understand] and yet by reason of
that which was hard upon the heart, there was a crying out with dread and
horror, and fear, That the Lord might speak no more least they dye; and so that
which is hard upon the heart, in the which by the Law (which is Light) sin is
found, that is it which is afraid to receive the Law, and come near the
darkness, and thunders, and tempests; and so, though many do talk of the Law
(being a Schoolmaster to Christ) yet are they as much afraid to receive the
Ministration of Condemnation, as their Fathers were, who might have boasted
that they were the people of God, and his only chosen flock, and that the Land
of rest was promised to them, and that they had fed upon the passover, (and yet
they perished before they came to that which was promised, who are left for an
example) and they might have boasted and talked much of the goodness of God,
and of his wonders, and of his presence being with them, and of their own
experiences therein, and that therefore they were not to come under the
Ministration of Condemnation, and fear, and horror, and trembling, and
astonishment; and that they need not now to be afraid of God who had showed
them so much love and mercy: And many such things might they have pleaded as
most professing people do now, who can talk of promises and deliverances, and
of Christ and his merits, and Righteousness, and Justification, and Redemption,
(fininished without them) and especially of Ordinances, and their own
experiences of the power of God, but are yet in their sins, having not received
the thing promised, neither come to him who is the end of the Law, and makes
an end of sin, whom many satisfy their vain minds with talking of him with the
same tongue that uses deceit; and professing him who is the end of the Law,
but the Law they despise, holding the Truth of God in the unrighteous grounds,
which by the mighty power of God, through the ministration of the Law, is to be
shaken and removed, as it is written, Sinai also was moved, and all Israel
trembled, and Moses did fear and quake, and once more will the Lord shake not
only the Earth, but the heavens also, and then shall the foundations of the
hypocrites be overturned for ever.

For though the Name of God and Christ be professed, yet if Moses Law be
despised, such dye without mercy; for the Law is to remove the iniquity which
does withold the mercy and the good things from man; and in the end of the
Law is that received by which the Law is fulfilled, which is according to the Law
and the Prophets; but there is none can come to that in the end of the Law, who
refuse to com to the beginning of the Law, and despise the Ministration of
Condemnation, and make a mock at trembling, or at least not knowing what it is,
exceedingly to fear and quake, being not in the least sensible what that is
which must be shaken and removed before the the thing promised be obtained; for
a promise may be made long before the thing promised be given or obtained; for
a promise was made unto Abraham and his seed, and yet it is written of him and
many more, that they dyed having not obtained the promises; and he that made
the promise was before the sin, who ministered forth the Law to discover the
sin; through the ministration whereof, and by obedience thereunto, that
comes to be received which takes away the sin, in which all the promises are
received.

And so all that come to receive the thing promised, they receive that which is
the end of the Law, and was before the sin, in which there is no sin, by which
sin is finished, and him received in whose mouth there is found no guile; who
brings his to be as he is in this present world, being made the righteousness
of God through him, having the righteousness of the Law fulfilled in them, by
him who is the end of the Law dwelling in them, in whom also his Power works
mightily, which is more then to talk of the Law being fulfilled without them;
for many such are neither come to that which fulfils the Law, neither yet to
the Law it self; and such are hating, reviling, backbiting, opposing, and many
ways persecuting those who witness the Law fulfilled in them, even as Saul who
was bred up at the feet of Gamaliel; and knew that of the Law which was written
without, and walked blameless according to the righteousness thereof, and yet
knew not that which gave forth the law, but persecuted him by whom the Law
should be fulfilled, Whose dreadful power smote him down, and a blindness came
upon that great professor who had profited much in that Religion above many of
his equals: And to that power which struck him blind did he then bow, and
became obedient, and afterward said, When the commandment came, sin revived,
and I dyed: And so that was struck blind, and is to be blinded, which
professed the Law before it come, and increased in that knowledge without the
life, and knew not that by which the Law should be fulfilled: Therefore that
which sees, must be blind; and that which is blind is to see. And this
revelation and heavenly vision he did not then call a Temptation, nor a
Delusion: Neither did he despise that which struck him blind, and let him see a
body of sin, and came to cut him down because of the sin, but cried out of his
wretchedness, and accounted all as dross and dung; and unto this he was
obedient, and this he loved, and did not say of it, That it was not able to
save him from sin, the which before did prick for sin, though against that
which pricked he had strived, (which was in him) and it was said unto him, It is
hard for thee to kick against the pricks.

And so that which striveth and kicketh against that which pricketh at the
heart, is that by which the heart is hardened; for the word is hid in the
heart, which word is sharp as a sword; which word being preached, some were
pricked to the heart (others cut to the heart) so that many cried out, Men and
Brethren, What shall we do to be saved? and so the word being nigh in which God
is striving with man, even piercing the hearts of many, that some in secret
have been ready to cry out and say, What shall I do to be saved? and yet being
not truly sensible what it is in them which did prick and pierce through the
heart, and let them see themselves out of Gods Covenant; therefore have they
strove against it, and called this a Temptation which was the powerful
operation of God by the light of his son in the heart, calling to repentance,
the which they have called a temptation of the Devil (esteeming it so to be)
which is most horrible blasphemy and resisting of the spirit, and refusing to
turn to him that smites: And this is the blindness of them who know not God,
who by the light of his son does knock at the door of the heart, to minister
forth the Law, to judge and condemn, and break the hardness, that in the broken
heart his Word of life might be received, and his power made known, to the
confounding of that which kept that in bondage (under the transgression) which
was given into man before the transgression was, out of which transgression
there is no coming, but by and through the ministration of Condemnation, which
does it discover in the ground of it, through which there is a coming to
receive the Gospel of Peace, which is the Power of God not to be preached to
the wicked things under which the just does suffer, which the Law is to, but by
the Lord of glory through the Light, preached to the spirit in prison, that it
through the Condemnation of the other, may grow up to lead and guide the
creature in all things in obedience to Gods will from a true sense of his love
in the heart, whereby his whole Law comes to be fulfilled, and the promise and
the blessing received in him who is the end of the Law, who is the light given
into man to let him see, and to condemn the sin, the which man being dead in,
and in trespasses, does not love, but is afraid of that which in secret judges
and reproves him, from the which man flying, forsakes that by which he should
come to receive the mercies of the Lord; but woe to them for ever who strive
with their maker, and call him Belzeebub who is the light in the heart, and
should be Master in the house.

Therefore let all take heed of despising the Law, which is written with the
finger of God in the heart whilst it is yet hard; for the Law of God is
perfect, making wise the simple, and the ministration thereof is to destroy
that which did it transgress, and lead unto him by whom the transgression is
finished: And this is not a temptation, but a dispensation of Gods Justice
through his righteous Law upon that which sinned, over which the Law has power
so long as that lives, which the Law is to kill, that through the death of it
that might come again to live which was before the Law, and before the death,
and before the sin.

And now when the Law or Ministration of Condemnation comes, man is to stand
still and wait quietly under it, and not let any thing break through in a
haste, to rage, or gaze, and wonder at that which is so dreadful that man is
not able to stand under it without unspeakable astonishment, because of that
which then is over him, who then is commanded not to break through least he
dye; for the Law is to break through that which cannot keep it, and make way to
that which is to keep it, and live for ever; but man is not to break through
from under the Condemnation, to that where the Law is ministered, until that is
received by which the Law may be kept; for such who in the condemnation do
abide, come at last to see and receive him that is made under the Law, and is
the end of it, and takes away the sin; but such who come to the Law, and break
out from under the Judgment before the law had brake through, and out down all
that in them which could not keep it; such have let in death again to reign
over that which with judgment should have been redeemed, to bear away that
which the law had power over, and arise up with that power, love, life and
obedience to God, as in all things to fulfill the whole law of God, which until
then, does still stand in force over that and them in which sin remains,
which does transgress the law, one tittle whereof shall not perish till all be
fulfilled, though some coming to the law have broke forth, and then healed the
wound slightly, supposing it would serve their turns to talk of the fulfilling
of it by and in another for them, and without them, seeing themselves not able
to keep it in all things, not waiting to the end of the law, by it to have all
that destroyed which could not keep it, and receive that which cannot break it;
[mark] and in it keep, by it to be lead out of the Wilderness of sin, in the
promised land to rest, in it to have the days prolonged, and the life
preserved; for Christ the light comes to save the life.

And there are many that are now come to peace, dominion and the land of rest,
who did once come to know the judgments of God upon Cains nature, which then
cried out, That his punishment was too heavy to bear, and have also come to see
the beast, whose head is full of the Names of Blasphemy, and yet have they not
started aside like a broken bow from under the judgment, neither suffered the
Enemy to prevail over them by temptations, to curse God and dye, nor to call
him Belzeebub who is the light which condemns and should be Master in the
house; neither have they despised Moses law, which is the Ministration of
Condemnation, and in its time is glorious; but in patience and long-suffering
under it have waited, and that without murmuring, or suffering that to break
forth in rage, which Gods judgments is to; neither have they suffered unbelief
to prevail over them, but in love to him who was made a curse, in patience have
endured all these things, and have been made as free to drink the Cup of
Astonishment, with the dregs thereof, as the Lord was to pour it forth unto
them, who now drink the Cup of salvation, even the blood of the Lamb which
cleanses from all sin, whose life saves them from the terror of the Pit, who
have come to feel the seed born and brought forth, though with pangs and
sorrow, which the blessing is to.

Those may see, hear, and understand what I write, who are come to know how the
law is handed forth by a Mediator, (who was before the law) and the
righteousness of God manifest without the law, and sin discovered by the law,
and Gods Righteousness revealed by that which was before the law; and that
notwithstanding the law must be received, yet by the Works thereof no flesh
shall be justified, but by obedience of Faith toward God in the blood of his
Son, by which all that is done away which transgrest the law; and so not of
Works, nor of Merits, but of Faith and Love is the Law fulfilled.

Concerning Temptation.
And that those who were born blind, and have been ever since covered with the
blackness of darkness, through their own Wisdom, being dead in trespasses and
sins, not feeling nor savouring the things of God, but remain in that Religion
and Profession which crucified his Son, who is a man of sorrows, and called him
a blasphemer who is the true light which lights every man that comes into
the world; and said he had a Devil, who came to condemn sin in the flesh, whose
light in every conscience is the condemnation so long as the evil deeds remain;
the which condemnation is not a temptation; for God who is light, tempts no
man to evil. Therefore in love is this written, that no man through blindness
and ignorance (in his own Wisdom) may esteem that to be a temptation which does
condemn, and that out of temptation all such who are tempted may be led and
kept by that which does condemn, which is the pure light of Christ which does
judge and condemn the temptations, and the sin, and the transgressor, (who
enters into it) and every evil motion which is apt to arise in the mind that
is darkened and blinded by the god of the World; which mind from the darkness
to the light is to be turned, in the light to bel^eve as he has said, I am the
light, believe in the light; and it is a temptation which hinders man from
believing in the light; and all such keep not the commands of Christ, who do
not believe and obey the light, and such profess his Words, but deny that in
which the power of his life does stand.

And it is a temptation which causes man to deny and refuse the Law (which is
light) and not come under nor receive the Ministration of Condemnation,
supposing he is under Grace, and so not to come back to the Law because he has
gotten a profession of Christ, whose day Abraham saw, whose seed came through
the Law, of whom Christ came who fulfils the Law, and makes an end of sin, who
was in the Church in the Wilderness, and in his pity saved them, and bare them
all the days of old, leading the humble feed, that through the Wilderness of
sin it might come, and at last enjoy that by which the sin is done away for
ever.

And it is a temptation which causes man to call that a temptation which in
the conscience does sometimes arise and let man see that he by his sin is in
the fall, the death and the curse, and that the judgments of God belongs to
him, and that he cannot escape the fierce wrath of the Almighty, living in that
by which sin is daily committed, and the righteous Law of God transgressed, and
himself out of the Covenant of life, wanting the power of God to bear him up
out of iniquity, so that he labors and prays, and cries sometimes with tears
(like Esau) to keep that alive in the transgression, which God has appointed
to destruction; [Consider this] And strive against that which lets see the
emptiness thereof, and condemns afterward, if a false joy does not arise,
secretly to glory in what was done, whereby that was satisfied and got ease
which the Judgment was to, which of the Judgment was afraid, and from under
it led forth to perform a will worship from that ground where Cains nature bears
rule, who can bring a sacrifice, but the deeds (with the light) seen to be
evil, who at last murders the Just, and the sin lying at the door, which
secret sin cannot be hid from the light in any that commit it, or in whom it
is, though never so secret.

And it is a temptation which works in the dark corners of the heart in the
time when condemnation comes to drive man to despair by reason of the
fierceness of the Judgment, and drives him from God and his righteous
Judgments, into unbelief and hardness of heart against God; and herein the
Tempter prevails over many, some whereof then go to destroy themselves, not
keeping in patience under the Judgment which was to destroy the sin; for
Christ the light comes to condemn and destroy the sin, but the life he comes to
save. Others through unbelief have hardened their hearts in sin, their minds
being in that in which they cannot believe that ever they shall overcome sin,
nor be saved from it; and such grow worse then before, and use all means in
vain lustful delights to murder that in them which checks, reproves and
condemns them for sin; and many here turn aside from under the condemnation,
many and various ways; some who are blind calling it melancholy; so that few
endure to the end, and enter through the strait Gate by the death, through it
the life to find, not waiting with long forbearance out of that which hastes,
in patience in the light to see, feel and know the seed of Abraham, (brought
forth of the barren Womb) which against hope, in hope believe: And these
Temptations leads further into sin, and is not that which condemns for sin;
for that would keep out of sin, though its Judgments be never so heavy upon
man for sin.

And being that God is known in the ways of his judgments, and that they who
are to receive the promise, must keep Judgment, and that with Judgment Sions
redemption is to be witnessed; and when Judgment begins to be set up in the
heart, to judge, condemn, confound, overturn and cut down the head, body and
root of all that which by the light is seen to be in the transgression, having
the form of godliness, but not the power which keeps out of, and free from
all sin, which the Judgment is to pass upon: Therefore is that a Temptation
which then draws forth the mind from under the Judgment, to get ease by a
supposed peace with God, from the comprehension of something done without, afar
off, or long ago, and so climbs up another way then by the light within (which
I know is the door) which condemns and brings to Judgment the hidden things
of darkness, and brings fire and sword upon the Earth, and sends not peace to
it, but sets two at variance within, whereby there is much striving in the
Womb, and not rest day nor night because of the War between the two seeds, out
of which trouble being led, by that which in the Judgment could not stand, so
that gets ease again, and then man preaches peace unto himself, having got
out of some trouble, he then striveth more strongly to keep out of it then he
did before, and labors much to comprehend a resting place to abide in, though
that be not redeemed with Judgment out of bondage, which thereby should come
to obtain rest and peace for evermore.

And being that the Law and the Prophets (together) are until John, and that
the Law is to judge and cut down that which is above the seed exalted; and that
the Prophesies and openings from the Testimony of Witness, is to uphold and
preserve under the Judgment, whereby some secret hopes or refreshings comes
unto that which at last out of bondage should be redeemed; therefore it is a
temptation which leads forth (on that hand) in a Joy, through the reason,
with great swelling imaginations in the vain light mind, out of the fear of
God, not standing in his counsel, but like the rest of the false Prophets,
coming to true openings, from it run forth, before that through Judgment be
brought forth, which should go before, and lead them in Gods Wisdom and Counsel
to stand; and such speak great swelling words in a secret pride, boasting of
their experiences, but are become the untimely children of the Mother of
Harlots, who with their Mother must be turned back into the bed of Torments.

And being the Lord God of life has given his Son a light in the heart, that
man might be led, taught and guided by him out of sin, and gives power to all
them that love, follovv and obey him, to overcome their sin, whose light being
in Man a free gift from God, and that by no other Name, Way or Means man can
ever be saved. Therefore it is a Temptation which leads out from that in the
heart, [Which in it is given there to make an end of sin] to follovv that
which does not make an end of sin, nor minister power to them that follovv
it, to overcome their sin, so that they cannot receive that which cleanses
from all sin; such have the root and ground in them from whence sin comes;
but the Root of Jesse in whom there is no sin, they are only professing and
talking of without them.

And it is a Temptation that leads man to commit any manner of sin
whatsoever, and keeps man from believing in him that makes an end of sin, and
keeps man in sin, and from repentance and turning from sin, (while that of God
in the conscience is striving with him against sin) persuading him that he
cannot be free from sin, and to put off the time of true repentance until Gods
spirit by the light in the heart, has ceased striving; and then such think all
is well, because that which judged and condemned them for the least appearance
of evil, has ceased striving with them, that so they are now quiet, and not
judged as formerly for what they do, though they do the same things for which
formerly they were judged; but let such assuredly know, that that which was
sin, is sin still, though they (instead of coming through the Law) are gone
back from the Law which did discover it, and came to that state again which was
before the Law, (or a worse) where death reigns, and sin is in the World,
though not discovered by the Law to them who have despised the Law, and so
become dead to that which should fulfill the Law, and also dead in that which
does transgress the Law, even so dead in sin, that not now feeling the weight
and burden thereof, neither yet feeling any thing of God in them, striving in
them against it; and is not their latter end like to be worse then their
beginning? And are not such as these who have got a profession, more hardened
in their sin, and pleading more strongly for their continuance therein, then
the Publicans, Harlots, Drunkards and Profane?

And it is a temptation which draws forth the mind to fear, love, serve, obey,
or respect any man, or created thing, glory, honor, or whatsoever may be named,
more then God; or to deny obedience to God for the attaining or retaining
thereof, or to let any of the most glorious creatures of God fill, and take
place in the heart, that in it room may not be found for the power of God to
enter; so that the life, virtue and substance of all things in which there is
full satisfaction, cannot be received.

And it is a temptation that leads forth to seek, or love the praise of men;
for if that was out of the Faith which received honor from men, then that must
needs be of the Devil which would compel honor to be given to it; that is it in
man of the Devil, which would have the begotten of God honor and worship it,
which would take the due honor and praise from God, to whom alone belongs
all Dominion, Glory, Honor and Obedience, and Praises for ever and ever.

And it is a temptation which draws forth the mind to Worship any other God
but he that made all men of one blood, and is above all, and through all, and
in you all; Who dwells in his people, and what of him may be known, is
manifest within, Whom all may feel after, and find, Whom the world by wisdom
does not know; who abhors the sacrifices of them whose hearts are
uncircumcised, and is wearyed with the peoples words, Mal. 2 17. and grieved
with their iniquity; who hears not the prayers of men of sin* but waits to
begracious unto such who wait for him in the light of his Son, who was lead as
a Lamb dumb, and is of the seed of David, who was dumb with silence, and opened
not his mouth while the wicked was in place.

But when the wicked thing is removed out of his place, and the humble seed of
the Shepherd raised up in his Throne upon his Hill of holiness, having his
Enemies under his feet, then he speaks with authority, and not as the Scribes.

Thus man coming into the fear of the Lord, and waiting in the light of his Son
in the heart, with it may he see and discern between that which discovers and
condemns sin, and that which tempts to sin, out of which that man may be
redeemed (and kept out of temptations) is this written in love to the seed,
over which the beast, the dog and the swine does vaunt themselves, who have
nothing to do with this, but only to receive the Cup of astonishment, which to
the Serpents is to be poured forth, who are not to feed upon this which is
written.

A direction in the way to that within the Vail, by which Temptations are
overcome.
TRuth is that in which the power of God does stand, and in the truth there is
no lie; and all them who receive truth from God, in it they receive his power,
whereby they are made his Sons, in his power tostand in obedience to his will,
which is that by which they are sanctified, and by obedience of faith
thereunto are preserved, keeping in steadfastness by the mighty power of God,
out of that which does defile, are preserved in that Dominion and place of
Holiness into which the Harlots (out of the truth and power) and all proud
boasters (and such who are intruding into things they have not seen, and all
Murmurers, who complain for want of power) does not enter.

Therefore all people who profess the knowledge of the truth, and yet have not
received the power of God in which no sin does stand; Wait ye all in the Light,
to know the Veil rent, and the ground to be removed from whence the Words
comes, which darkens that in which the Counsel of God should be received, and
wait to feel Judgment and Condemnation upon the Earthly that over the seed
does rule; and keep Judgment, that through the Condemnation that may spring,
which never yet was found: For certainly till there be a coming through the
Ministration of Condemnation, the Pearl is hid under the Earth, and the Earthly
bears rule over it, whereby it still in bondage lies, and the creature
sometimes led by a sight of that which it does not possess, holding the truth
of God in that which is not his Righteousness; for his Righteousness is
revealed by Faith through the power of him that takes away the sin; and so it is
not comprehended in, by that mind which is out of the Covenant: And this know
assuredly, That many may see that which is afar off, and not feel the life of
what they see; and so are many high professors in the World, who change from
one opinion to another, and are all yet but fruitless Trees, which are to be
cut down and rooted up.

And many there are who call him that is the Light Lord and Master, but to the
Light are not obedient in self-denial, nor taking up the daily-Cross, which is
the power of God, and crucifies unto the World; and so the first man of the
World being not crucified nor put off, the new man is not received; and so
little more is witnessed by many who profess truth without the life, then was
in the time of other Forms; for if the death be not known, the resurrection of
the Just received, and the dead raised, then is all in vain: And this is not
known by any but such who know the Judgments of the Lord set up in the heart,
and the Cup of Astonishment to the Adulterous seed which comes of the Will of
the flesh, and cannot lay down the life for the Friend.

Wherefore (I say) Wait to know the Birth that is immortal, and feel that born
up which never yet was raised in them, over whom the Vail yet is, that the
free-Birth may be known, and the Seed whom God has appointed the blessing
unto, from under death redeemed; that by the powerful risings thereof, the
understanding may be opened with that which was before Forms were, that to it
you may come which gives life unto the soul, and know a Savior borne of the
barren Womb, and a Deliverer brought forth in the place where he has not been
known, and the plant to spring out of that ground which is yet dry, that it may
be overshadowed with the loveliness of its spreading forth, that a Way may be
opened in the Wilderness, and the humble exalted in the Valley; and so come to
learn of that which is yet little and low, and take heed of taking counsel of
the Serpent, whose subtilty will soon lead forth from the simplicity, neither
cover your selves with any thing before the Righteousness of God (which is
perfect) be received; but love that which comes from the man of sorrows, who
comes to break the peace of all them who walk not in the everlasting Way of
Life. Let all them who are out of it, search their hearts with the Light.

And take heed of that which is high, forward, or strong in the Will, [for we
are weak] which is not brought to the Cross; for there is the first birth from
the wrong grounds, which will speak and act that which it lives not in;
neither is able to confirm it in faithfulness to the death and loss of all; for
things may be true in themselves, and that which is out of the truth may speak
of it, yet such vain talkers cannot suffer to death for what they speak.

For that which comes forth first, is strong in the Earthly, and would live
for ever, and have the blessing, and would rule over the meek thing in the
particular, and in others, having a secret desire to be admired, being far
unwilling to take a servants place; but certainly it is the meek, humble,
suffering seed (which in many is yet oppressed) that is to last for ever, who
through death comes into the Dominion.

Therefore sink down out of the airy Comprehension and subtilty above the life,
and first come to suffer with that which is meek and lovv, if ever you intend
with it to reign in that peace and life which from all that without, the
Vail, is hid; and in silence watch and be sober to see him come which saves the
soul, and clothes it with his own Righteousness, that you be not found without
a covering of the spirit, power, and life, among the foolish Virgins, for few
there be that find the Way of life, and abide therein.

And I knowing the terror of the Lord that will certainly come upon all them
who dye out of his Covenant, therefore I warn all people every where (as the
Lord enlarges me) to wait to feel the powerful Word of repentance, and with
the light to make diligent search into the ground and foundation of all
Professions, Words and Actions.

For the Lord God will make inquisition for the blood of the Just, and reward
the double-minded according to the intents of their hearts, the Gaul whereof
will be rent with the power of his Might, which will sweep away the refuge of
lies, and confound your Divinations in the head of that knowledge above the
seed; and a day of desolation must come, Sword and Famine must you know, and
the Earth to be removed, and your heavens shaken, that the poor may come to
receive the glad tidings of the Gospel, which is the power of God; for the fat
and the strong is for judgment both within and without, and they are still
sent away empty; but the poor are they which are to be satisfied, not the rich,
high, wise, strong, mighty, prudent Diviners, and Orthodox Men, and zealous
Professors, and licentious Libertines, (as they are called) who profess a
Savior to come; and some would have a King to reign hereafter, but they are
not agreed how, nor when, nor where their King shall reign (whom they imagine
shall come) but are sound despisers, and not lovers, nor faithful followers of
him that is come, the glory of whose KINGDOM is already shining over the World,
and is established in righteousness, Who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,
Who is our Head, our Lawgiver and our King; and we do not look for another;
as the Drunkards of Ephraim do, who are drunk, but not with Wine, and staggar
at noonday, and must be dashed one against another, and broken to pieces as
the potsherds of the Earth, who are looking for a King to come, and know not
the King who is already come; Who is the Light to which they will not bow,
though it in secret does them reprove, and shows us plainly of the Father,
and lets them see their disobedience.

To it now therefore bovv and bend, for plainly the Lord God who is light
will not alvvayes strive by the light of his Son in your hearts; and this
know, That as I tender the least honest desires that are begotten in any after
the living Truth of God, yet I am to deal plainly with all, and clear my
conscience of all Who are covered with their own conceivings, and in Words
and Writing to vvarn all in the spirit of truth and meekness, as the Lord
moves me in faithfulness to declare against that which yet in any bears rule
over the Seed, which by judgment must be overturned, and all the judgments
of the Lord are true.

Wherefore ye that are vvilling to come out of temptations into that where the
foolish virgins cannot enter, wait in the fear of the Lord to feel his Work
within, while the day of salvation lasts, least thick darkness come upon
you, and you be found in the night in which none can work; and take heed of a
secret high mindedness, and prize your day of visitation more then life or
liberty, and take heed of that which would contrive a way to shun the cross,
or stop the mouth of the vvitness; but let the honest simplicity come to rule
in the measure of it, and take heed of entering in, and yiedling to temptations;
for many vvayes has the Serpent (which is near) to beguile and destroy the
life from man, which is not overcome, but in the continual fear, through the
cross to the Will, with the power of the light which is given to lead
through all these things, into the rest which is prepared only for them who
are faithful to the light.

For this have I not learned nor received from men, (the Lord God knovveth I
lie not) but through the operation of the mighty power of God, whose
indignation I have born, in whose judgments I rejoice for ever, and glorify
and praise his blessed Name, who by it my Wisdom confounded, and suffered me
to be sifted and tempted by the Enemy diverse vvayes, yet preserved my life
under the shadovv of his Wing, that I might praise and serve him in the Land of
the living, and declare his Wonders among the sons of men, and let them also
see with the light the narrovv way that they are to come, which in some
measure has been declared, though in that language which the Wisdom of the
World may not understand, and call it legal, to whom as foolishness it may
appear; but my voice may be known to the spirit in prison, whom my soul
travels for in the bowels of my Fathers love.

H. S.
