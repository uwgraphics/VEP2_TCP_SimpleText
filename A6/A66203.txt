By the King,
A PROCLAMATION For a General Fast and Humiliation throughout the whole Kingdom.
WILLIAM R.

WHereas the Commons in Parliament Assembled, have Humbly besought Us to
Appoint a Solemn Day of Fasting and Humiliation, for Imploring the Blessing of
Almighty God upon the Consultations of this present Parliament; And We, being
deeply sensible how much the Happiness of Our Kingdoms Depends upon the Good
Success of their Consultations, and out of Our Own Religious Disposition,
Readily to Incline to so Pious a Motion, have Resolved (by and with the Advice
of Our Privy Council) and do, by this Our Royal Proclamation, Strictly Charge
and Command, That a Day of General and Public Fasting and Humiliation for the
Purposes aforesaid, be Strictly Kept and Observed throughout Our Cities of
London and Westminster and elsewhere within the Weekly Bills of Mortality, on
Wednesday the Eleventh Day Of December next, and in all other Places within
this Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, on
Wednesday the Eighteenth Day of the said December next. And for the better
Solemnizing the same, We have given Directions to the Most Reverend
Archbishops, and Right Reverend Bishops of this Kingdom, to Compose a Form of
Prayer suitable to this Occasion, to be Used in all Churches and Chapels, and
other Places of Public Worship; And to take Care for the timely Dispersing the
same throughout their respective Dioceses. And We do strictly Charge and
Command, That the said Day of Fasting and Humiliation be Religiously observed
by all Our Loving Subjects, as they tender the Favor of Almighty God, and upon
Pain of Suffering such Punishments, as may be justly Inflicted for the Contempt
or Neglect thereof.

Given at Our Court at Kensington, the Thirtieth Day of November, 1695. In the
Seventh Year of Our Reign.
