Quod verum atque bonum est inquiro, and totus in hoc sum.
OXFORD, Printed by L. LICHFIELD, Printer to the University, for ANTHONY
STEPHENS Bookseller near the Theater 1684.

To His Honored Friend ARTHVR CHARLET A.M. Fellow of Trinity College in OXON.
SIR,
THis in its several parts being addressed to my Intimate Acquaintance, desires
a Patron of the same rank; and has pitched on You as the most able to endure,
and most ready to oblige by accepting a greater trouble than the rest: It is
the defense of the Whole that you must be engaged in, whilst the others singly
are charged only with a Part: and in this I have followed the example of the
Ancients, who tho they had one of the Lares to preside over every little room,
yet the whole house was dedicated to some Common Guardian: This Distinction
proceeded either from a real inequality of Power in the Protectors, or from the
difference of those benefits which They were supposed to have actually
bestowed: As to the former consideration, every one that knows my Friends will
easily allow that each singly is sufficient for the whole, tho, by reason of my
imperfections, a great task: But the latter, Sir, gives You the preference, and
Gratitude forces me to believe his power to be greatest, who has most often,
and most signally expressed it: Innumerable private Favors I must acknowledge
the same way they were bestowed, and spare your Modesty and my own: for
otherwise it would seem that I thought there was some thing in my felf worth
your notice; or else I must publicly proclaim, that You (which tho it is really
your Case, yet very few can boast) are kind and generous without any prospect
of return: But those which properly relate to the present occasion I must beg
leave to mention, since Pliny, and all agree, has severely noted as the
greatest Ingratitude not to acknowledge to whom we owe what we have attained;
and it would argue stupidity to run wilfully on that Censure, which has been
so justly passed, and so much applauded.

You may remember Sir how often, when the public Cares of your well-managed
Office would permit you to retreat, we have retired to a Grove, where Quiet
spreads all around, and a springing verdure, and checkered variety to raise the
Thoughts and recreate the Fancy; whilst soft breezes murmured through the Trees,
which, like our Affections, served only to intermix, but never to shatter or
disturb: There I have enjoyed whatever the Poets could imagine, a free
innocent, and instructive discourse, such as reformed my Errors, and encouraged
those Essays which you was pleased to think endeavors after virtue; till then I
envied the happiness of the described Swains, and looked on Virgil and
Theocritus as disturbers of Man kind, who elaborately described the most
perfect and surprising Beautys, but gave us no Hopes either to see or to enjoy.
The Golden age was their scene, and 'twas necessary to look beyond Jupiter
himself to find any thing innocent or pleasing; and how tedious such a search
must be; every one may imagine, who considers that it is very hard to take so
large a prospect, especially when there is nothing but a bare Contemplation to
excite, and reward his Diligence. The time Sir, I found brought back again by
your conversation, and all those difficulties ((...)) which were so even to a
Proverb, practically explained: so that whatever in this performance is drawn
soft, innocent, and pleasing; is but a Copy from You the Original: This is the
happiness that attends polite Learning, it smooths all the natural Asperities
of Humor and Passion, and spreads an obligeing tenderness through the whole Man,
And where the Cause is in so eminent a degree, and the Effect too necessary,
what can hinder the Production? These are the reasons that have determined my
acknowledgements for former, and given me encouragement to beg a new
Obligation, To accept this, and pardon its defects will be a very considerable
one to

Sir, Your most Humble Servant THOMAS CREECH.

A TREATISE de CARMINE PASTORALI Written by RAPIN.
The First Part.
TO be as short as possible in my discourse upon the present Subject, I shall
not touch upon the Excellency of Poetry in general; nor repeat those high
Encomiums, (as that it is the most divine of all human Arts, and the like) which
Plato in his Jone, Aristotele in his Poetica, and other Learned men have
copiously insisted on: And this I do that I might more closely and briefly
pursue my present design, which, no doubt* will not please every man; for since
I treat of that part of Poetry, which (to use Quintilian's words) by reason of
its Clownishness, is afraid of the Court and City; some may imagine that I
follow Nichocaris his humor, who would paint only the most ugly and deformed,
and those too in the meanest and most frightful dress, that real, or fancied
Poverty could put them in.

For some think that to be a Sheapard is in it self mean, base, and sordid; And
this I think is the first thing that the graver and soberer sort will be ready
to object.

But if we consider how honorable that employment is, our Objectors from that
Topic will be easily answered: for as Heroic Poems owe their dignity to the
Quality of Heroes, so Pastorals to that of Sheapards.

Now to manifest this, I shall not rely on the authority of the Fabulous, and
Heroic Ages, tho, in the former, a God fed Sheep in Thessaly, and in the
latter, Hercules the Prince of Heroes, (as Paterculus styles him) grazed on
mount Aventine: These Examples, it is true, are not convinceing, yet they
sufficiently show that the employment of a Sheapard was sometime looked upon to
be such, as in those Fabulous times was not altogether unbecomeing the Dignity
of a Hero, or the Divinity of a God: which consideration if it cannot be of
force enough to procure excellence, yet certainly it may secure it from the
imputation of baseness, since it was sometime looked upon as fit for the
greatest in Earth or Heaven.

But not to insist on the authority of Poets, sacred Writ tells us that Jacob
and Esau, two great men, were Sheapards; And Amos, one of the Royal Family,
asserts the same of himself, for He was among the Sheapards of Tecua, following
that employment: The like by Gods own appointment prepared Moses for a Scepter,
as Philo intimates in his life, when He tells us, that a Sheapards Art is a
suitable preparation to a Kingdom; the same He mentions in the Life of Joseph,
affirming that the care a Sheapard has over his Cattle, very much resembles
that which a King has over his Subjects: The same Basil in his Homily de S.
Mamm. Martyr has concerning David, who was taken from following the Ews great
with young ones to feed Israel, for He says that the Art of feeding and
governing are very near akin, and even Sisters: And upon this account I suppose
it was, that Kings amongst the Greeks reckoned the name of Sheapard one of their
greatest titles, for, if we believe Varro, amongst the Ancients, the best and
bravest was still a Sheapard: Every body knows that the Romans the worthiest
and greatest Nation in the World sprang from Sheapards: The Augury of the
Twelve Vulturs placed a Scepter in Romulus's hand which held a Crook before;
and at that time, as Ovid says, His own small Flock each Senator did keep.

Lucretius mentions an extraordinary happiness, and as it were Divinity in a
Sheaperd's life, Through Sheapards ease, and their Divine retreats.

And this is the reason, I suppose, why the solitude of the Country, the shady
Groves, and security of that happy Quiet was so grateful to the Muses, for thus
Horace represents them, The Muses that the Country Love.

Which Observation was first made by Mnasalce the Sicyonian in his Epigram upon
Venus.

The Rural Muse upon the Mountains feeds. For sometimes the Country is so
raveshing and delightful, that twill raise Wit and Spirit even in the dullest
Clod, And in truth, amongst so many heats of Lust and Ambition which usually
fire our Citys, I cannot see what retreat, what comfort is left for a chaste and
sober Muse.

And to speak from the very bottom of my heart, (not to mention the integrity
and innocence of Sheapards upon which so many have insisted, and so copiously
declaimed) methinks he is much more happy in a Wood, that at ease contemplates
this universe, as his own, and in it, the Sun and Stars, the pleasing Meadows,
shady Groves, green Banks, stately Trees, flowing Springs, and the wanton
windings of a River, fit objects for quiet innocence, than he that with Fire
and Sword disturbs the World, and measures his possessions by the wast that lys
about him: Augustus in the remotest East fights for peace, but how tedious were
his Voyages? how troublesome his Marches? how great his disquiets? what fears
and hopes distracted his designs? whilst Tityrus contented with a little, happy
in the enjoyment of his Love, and at ease under his spreading Beech.

Taught Trees to sound his Amaryllis name. On the one side Melibaeus is forced
to leave his Country, and Antony on the other; the one a Sheapard, the other a
great man, in the Commonwealth; how disagreeable was the Event? the Sheapard
could endure himself, and sit down contentedly under his misfortunes, whilst
lost Antony, unable to hold out, and quitting all hopes both for himself and
his Queen, became his own barbarous Executioner: Than which sad and deplorable
fall I cannot imagine what could be worse, for certainly nothing is so
miserable as a Wretch made so from a flowrishing and happy man; by which it is
evident how much we ought to prefer before the gaity of a great and shining
State, that Idol of the Crowd, the lowly simplicity of a Sheapards Life: for
what is that but a perfect image of the state of Innocence, of that golden Age,
that blessed time, when Sincerity and Innocence, Peace, Ease, and Plenty
inhabited the Plains?

Take the Poets description Here Lowly Innocence makes a sure retreat,
A harmless Life, and ignorant of deceit,
And free from fears with various sweet's increase,
And all is over spread with the soft wings of Peace:
Here Oxen low, here Grots, and purling Streams,
And spreading shades invite to easy dreams.


And thus Horace.

Happy the man beyond pretense
Such was the state of Innocence, etc.
And from this head I think the dignity of Buoolicks is sufficiently cleared,
for as much as the Golden Age is to be preferred before the Heroic, so much
Pastorals must excel Heroic Poems: yet this is so to be understood, that if
we look upon the majesty and loftiness of Heroic Poems, it must be confessed
that they justly claim the pre-eminence; but if the unaffected neatness,
elegant, graceful smartness of the expression, or the polite dress of a Poem be
considered, then they fall short of Pastorals: for this sort flows with Sweet,
Elegant, neat and pleasing fancies; as is too evident to every one that has
tasted the sweeter muses, to need a farther explication: for it is not probable
that Asinius Pollio, Cinna, Varius, Cornelius Gallus, men of the neatest Wit,
and that lived in the most polite Age, or that Augustus Caesar the Prince of
the Roman elegance, as well as of the common Wealth, should be so extremely
taken with Virgils Bucolicks, or that Virgil himself a man of such singular
prudence, and so correct a judgment, should dedicate his Eclogues to those
great Persons; unless he had known that there is somewhat more then ordinary
Elegance in those sort of Composures, which the wise perceive, tho far above
the understanding of the Crowd: nay if Ludovicus Vives, a very learned man, and
admired for politer studies may be believed, there is somewhat more sublime and
excellent in those Pastorals, than the Common sort of Grammarians imagine: This
I shall discourse of in an other place, and now inquire into the Antiquity of
Pastorals.

Since Linus, Orpheus, and Eumolpus were famous for their Poems, The Antiquity
of Pastoral^.
before the Trojan wars; those are certainly mistaken, who date Poetry from
that time; I rather incline to their opinion who make it as old as the World it
self; which Assertion as it ought to be understood of Poetry in general, so
especially of Pastoral, which, as Scaliger delivers, was the most ancient kind
of Poetry, and resulting from the most ancient way of Liveing: Singing first
began amongst Sheapards as they fed their Flocks, either by the impulse of
nature, or in imitation of the notes of Birds, or the whispering of Trees.

For since the first men were either Sheapards or Ploughmen, and Sheapards, as
may be gathered out of Thucydides and Varro, were before the others, they were
the first that either invited by their leisure, or (which Lucretius thinks more
probable) in imitation of Birds, began a tune.

Through all the Woods they heard the pleasing noise
Of chirping Birds, and tried to frame their voice,
And Imitate, thus Birds instructed man,
And taught them Songs before their Art began.
In short, it is so certain that Verses first began in the Country that the thing
is in it self evident, and this Tibullus very plainly signifies, First weary at
his Plough the laboring Hind
In certain feet his rustic words did bind:
His dry reed first he tuned at sacred feasts
To thank the bounteous Gods, and cheer his Guests.


In certain feet according to Bern Cylenius of Verona his interpretation in set
measures: for Censorinus tells us, that the ancient Songs were loose and not
tied up to any strict numbers, and afterward by certain laws and acknowledged
rules were confined to such and such measures: for this is the method of Nature
in all her works, from imperfect and rude beginnings things take their first
rise, and afterward by fit and apposite additions are polish't, and brought to
perfection: such were the Verses which heretofore the Italian Sheapards and
Plough-men, as Virgil says, sported amongst themselves.

Italian Plough-men sprung from ancient Troy
Did sport unpolish't Rhymes --
Lucretius in his Fifth Book de Natura Rerum, says, that Sheapards were first
taught by the rushing of soft Breezes amongst the Canes to blow their Reeds,
and so by degrees to put their Songs in tune.

For Whilst soft Evening Gales blew over the Plains
And shook the sounding Reeds, they taught the Swains,
And thus the Pipe was framed, and tuneful Reed,
And whilst the Flocks did then securely feed,
The harmless Sheapards tuned their Pipes to Love,
And Amaryllis name filled every Grove.
From all which it is very plain that Poetry began in those days, when Sheapards
took up their employment: to this agrees Donatus in his Life of Virgil, and
Pontanus in his Fifth Book of Stars, as appears by these Verses.

Here underneath a shade by purling Springs
The Sheapards Dance, whilst sweet Amyntas sings;
Thus first the new found Pipe was tuned to Love,
And Plough-men taught their Sweet hearts to the Grove,
Thus the Fescennine jests when they sang harvest-home, and then too the
Grape-gatherers and Reapers Songs began, an elegant example of which we have in
the Tenth Idyllium of Theocritus.

From this birth, as it were, of Poetry, Verse began to grow up to greater
matters; For from the common discourse of Plough-men and Sheapards, first
Comedy, that Mistress of a private Life, next Tragedy, and then Epick Poetry
which is lofty and Heroical arrose, This Maximus Tyrius confirms in his Twenty
first dissetation, where he tells us that Plough-men just comeing from their
work, and scarce cleansed from the filth of their employment, did use to flurt
out some sudden and extempore Catches; and from this beginning Plays were
produced, and the Stage erected: Thus much concerning the Antiquity, next of
the Original of this sort.

About this Learned men cannot agree, for who was the first Author, is not
sufficiently understood; Donatus, it is true, tells us it is proper to the Golden
Age, and therefore must needs be the product of that happy time: but who was
the Author, where, what time it was first invented has been a great
Controversy, and not yet sufficiently determined: Epicharmus one of Pythagoras
his School, in his (...) mentions one Diomus a Sicilian, who, if we believe
Athoenoeus was the first that wrote Pastorals: those that fed Cattle had a
peculiar kind of Poetry, called Bucolicks, of which Dotimus a Sicilian was
inventer:

Diodorus Siculus (...), seems to make Daphnis the son of Mercury and a certain
Nymph, to be the Author; and agreeable to this, Theon an old Scholiast on
Theocritus, in his notes upon the first Idyllium mentioning Daphnis, adds, he
was the Author of Bucolicks, and Theocritus himself calls him the Muses
Darling: and to this Opinion of Diodorus Siculus Polydore Virgil readily
assents.

B^r Mnaseas of Patara in a discourse of his conc^^ning Europa, speaks thus of
a Son of Pan the God of Sheapards: Panis Filium Bubulcum a quo and Bucolice
canere: Now whether Mnaseas by that Bubulcum, means only a Herds-man, or one
skilled in Bucolicks, is uncertain: but if Valla's judgment be good, it is to be
taken of the latter: yet Aelian was of another mind, for he boldly affirms that
Stesichorus called Himeroeus was the first, and in the same place adds, that
Daphnis the Son of Mercury was the first Subject of Bucolicks.

Some ascribe the Honor to Bacchus the President of the Nymphs, Satyrs, and the
other Country Gods, perhaps because he delighted in the Country; and others
attribute it to Apollo called Nomius the God of Sheapards, and that he invented
it then when he served Admetus in Thessaly, and fed his Herds: For, it is likely,
he to recreate himself, and pass away his time, applied his mind to such Songs
as were best suitable to his present condition: Many think we owe it to Pan the
God of Sheapards, not a few to Diana that extremely delighted in solitude and
Woods; and some say Mercury himself: of all which whilst Grammarians prattle,
according to their usual custom they egregiously trifle; they suffer
themselves to be put upon by Fables, and resign their judgment up to foolish
pretentions, but things and solid truth is that we seek after.

As about the Author, so concerning the place of its Birth there is a great
dispute, some say Sparta, others Peloponesus, but most are for Sicily.

Valla the Placentine, a curious searcher into Antiquity, thinks this sort of
Poetry first appear^d amongst the Lacedaemonians, for when the Persians had
wasted almost all Greece, the Spartans say that they fot fear of the
Barbarians fled into Caves and lurking holes; and that the Country Youth then
began to apply themselves in Songs to Diana Caryatis, together with the Maids,
who midst their Songs offered Flowers to the Goddess: which custom containing
somewhat of Religion was in those places a long time very scrupulously observed.

Diomedes the Grammarian, in his treatise of Measures, declares Sicily to be
the Place: for thus he says, the Sicilian Sheapards in time of a great
Pestilence, began to invent new Ceremonies to appease incensed Diana, whom
afterward, for affording her help, and stopping the Plague they called (...):
i. e. the Freer from their Miserys. This grew into custom, and the Sheapards
used to meet in Companies, to sing their deliverer Diana's praise, and th^se
afterward passing into Italy we^e there nam^d Bucoliastoe.

Pomponius Sabinus tells the story thus: When the Hymns the Virgins used to
sing in the Country to Diana were left off, because, by reason of the present
Wars, the Maidens were forced to keep close within the Towns; the Shepherds
met, and sang those kind of Songs, which are now called Bucolicks, to Diana; to
whom they could not give the usual worship by reason of the Wars: But Donatus
says, that this kind of Verses was first sung to Diana by Orestes, when he
wandered about Italy; after he fled from Scythia Taurica, and had taken away the
Image of the Goddess, and hid it in a bundle of sticks, whence she received the
name of Pascelina, or Phacelide (...); At whose Altar, the very same Orestes
was afterward expiated by his Sister Iphigenia: But how can any one rely on
such Fables, when the inconsiderable Authors that propose them disagree so much
amongst themselves?

Some are of Opinion that the Shepherds, were wont in solemn and set Songs about
the Fields and Towns to celebrate the Goddess Pales; and beg her to bless their
flocks and fields with a plenteous increase, and that from hence the name, and
composure of Bucolicks continued.

Other prying ingenious Men make other conjectures, as to this mazing
Controversy thus Vossius delivers himself; The Ancients cannot be reconciled,
but I rather incline to their opinion who think Bucolicks were invented either
by the Sicilians or Peloponesians, for both those use the Dorick Dialect, and
all the Greek Bucolicks are writ in that: As for my self I think, that what
Horace says of Elegies may be applied to the present Subject.

But who soft Elegies was the first that wrote
Grammarians doubt, and cannot end the doubt:
For I find nothing certain about this matter, since neither Valla a diligent
inquirer after, and a go^d judge in such things, nor any of the late writers
produce any thing upon which I can safely rely: yet what beginning this kind of
Poetry had, I think I can pretty well conjecture: for it is likely that first
Shepherds used Songs to recreate themselves in their leisure hours whilst they
fed their Sheep; and that each man, as his wit served, accommodated his Songs
to his present Circumstances: to this Solitude invited, and the extreme leisure
that attends that employment absolutely required it: For as their retirement
gave them leisure, and Solitude a fit place for Meditation, Meditation and
Invention produced a Verse, which is nothing else but a Speech fit to be sung,
and so Songs began: Thus Hesiod was made a Poet, for he acknowledges himself
that he received his inspiration; Whilst under Helicon he fed his Lambs. for
either the leisure, or fancy of Shepherds seems to have a natural aptitude to
Verse.

And indeed I cannot but agree with Lucretius that accurate Searcher into
Nature, who delivers that from that state of Innocence the Golden Age,
Pastorals continued down to his time, for after he had in his fifth book
described that most happy age, he adds, For then the Rural Muses reigned.

From whence it is very plain, that as Donatus himself observed, Pastorals were
the invention of the simplicity and innocence of that Golden age, if there was
ever any such, or certainly of that time which succeeded the beginning of the
World: For tho the Golden Age must be acknowledged to be only in the fabulous
times, yet it is certain that the Manners of the first Men were so plain and
simple, that we may easily derive both the innocent employment of Shepherds,
and Pastorals from them.

The Second PART.
NOw let us inquire into the nature of Pastoral, in what its excellencies
consist, and how it must be made to be exact: And this must needs be a hard
Task, since I have no guide, neither Aristotle nor Horace to direct me, for
both they, whatever was the matter, speak not one word of this sort of Verse.
And I am of opinion that none can treat well and clearly of any kind of Poetry
if he has no helps from these two: But since they lay down some general
Notions of Poetry which may be useful in the present case, I shall follow their
steps as close as possible I can.

Not only Aristotle but Horace too has defined that Poetry in general is
Imitation; I mention only these two, for tho Plato in his Second Book de Rep.
and in his Timoeus delivers the same thing, I shall not make use of his
Authority at all: Now as Comedy according to Aristotle is the Image and
Representation of a gentiel and City Life, so is Pastoral Poetry of a County
and Sheapards Life; for since Poetry in general is Imitation; its several
Species must likewise Imitate, take Aristotle's own words Cap. 1. (...); And
these Species are differenc't either by the subject matter, when the things to
be imitated are quite different, or when the manner in which you imitate, or
the mode of imitation is so: (...): Thus tho of Epick Poetry and Tragedy the
Subject is the same, and some great illustrious Action is to be imitated by
both, yet since one by representation, and the other by plain narration
imitates, each makes a different Species of imitation. And Comedy and Tragedy,
tho they agree in this, that both represent, yet because the Matter is
different, and Tragedy must represent some brave action, and Comedy a humor;
these Two sorts of imitation are Specifically different. And upon the same
account, since Pastoral chooses the man's of Sheapards for i^s imitation, it
takes from its matter a peculiar difference, by which it is distinguished from
all others.

But here Benius in his comments upon Aristotle has started a considerable
query: which is this; Whether Aristotle, when be reckons up the different
Species of Poetry Cap 1. does include Pastoral, or no? And about this I find
learned men cannot at all agree: which certainly Benius should have determined,
or not raised: some refer it to that sort which was sung to Pipes, for that
Pastorals were so Apuleius intimates, when at the marriage Feast of Phyche He
brings in Paniscus singing Bucolicks to his Pipe: But since they did not
seriously enough consider, what Aristotle meant by that which he calls (...)
they trifle, talk idly, and are not to be heeded in this matter; For suppose
some Musician should sing Virgils Aenoeis to the Harp, (and Ant. Lullus says it
has been done,) should we therefore reckon that divine and incomparable Master
of Heroic Poetry amongst the Lyricks?

Others with Coesius Bassus and Isacius Tzetzes hold that that distribution of
Poetry, which Aristotle and Tully has left us, is deficient and imperfect* and
that only the chief Species are reckone^, but the more inconsiderable not
mentioned: I shall not here interest my self in that quarrel of the Criti^ks,
whether we have all Aristotle's books of Poet^y o^ no^^ this is a considerable
difficulty I c^^fess, for Laertius who accurately weighs this ^^tte^, says that
he wrote two books of Poetry, the one l^st, and the other we have, tho
Mutinensis is of an other mind: but to end this dispute, I must agree wit^
Vossius, who says the Philosopher comp^e^ended these Species not expressly
mentioned, under a higher and more noble head: and tha^ therefore Pastoral was
contained in Epick. for these are his o^n words, besides there are Epicks of an
inferior rank, such as the Writers of Bucolicks. Sincerus, as Minturnus quotes
him, is of the same mind, for thus he delivers his opinion concerning Epick
Verse: The matters about which these numbers may be employed is various, either
mean and low, as in Pastorals, great and lofty, as when the Subject is Divine
Things, or Heroic Actions, or of a middle rank, as when we use them to deliver
precepts in: And this likewise ^e signifys before, where he sets down three
sorts of Epicks one of which, says he, is divine, and the most excellent by
much in all Poetry; the other the lowest but most pure, in which Theocritus
excelled, which indeed shows nothing of Poetry beside the bare numbers: These
points being thus settled, the remaining difficultys will be more easily
dispatched.

For as in Dramatick Poetry the Dignity and meanness of the Persons represented
make two diffferent Species of imitation the one Tragic* ^^ch agrees to none
but great and ^lustrious persons, the other Comic, which suits with common and
gentile humors: so in Epick too there may be reckoned two sorts of Imitation,
one of which b^lon^s to Heroes, and that makes the ^eroick; the other to
Rusticks and Sheapards and that constitutes the Pastoral, now as a Picture
imitates the Fe^tu^^s of the face, so Poetry does action, and ^is not a
representation of the Person but the Action. From all which we may gather this
definition of Pastoral: The Definition of Pastoral.
It is the imitation of the Action of a Sheapard, or of one taken under that
^haracter: Thus Virgil's Gallus, tho not ^eally a Sheapard, for he was a man of
great quality in Rome, ^et belongs to Pastoral, because he is represented like
a Sheapard: hence the ^oet: The Goatherd and the heavy Heardsmen came,
And ask't what raised the deadly ^lame.


The Scene lys amongst Sheapards, the Swains are brought in, the Herdsmen come
to see his misery, and the fiction is suited to the real condition of a
Sheapard; the same is to be said for his Silenus, who tho he seems lofty, and
to sound to loud for an oaten reed, yet since what he sings he sings to
Sheapards, and suits his Subject to their apprehensions, his is to be
acknowledged Pastoral. ^his rule we must stick to, that we might infallibly
discern what is stricktly ^astoral in Virgil and Theocritus, and what not: for
in Theocritus there are some more lofty thoughts which not having any thing
belonging to Sheapards for their Subject, must by no means be accounted
Pastoral, But of this more in its proper place.

My present inquiry must be what is the Subject Matter of a Pastoral, about
which it is not easy to resolve; since neither from Aristotle, nor any of the
Greeks who have written Pastorals, we can receive certain direction. For
sometimes they treat of high and sublime things, like Epick Poets; what can be
loftier than the whole Seventh Idyllium of Bias in which Myrsan urges Lycidas
the Sheapard to sing the Loves of Deidamia, and Achilles. For he begins from
Helen's rape, and goes on to the revengful fury of the Atrides, and shuts up in
one Pastoral, all that is great and sounding in Homers Iliad.

Sparta was fired with Rage
And gather^d Greece to prosecute Revenge.
And Theocritus his verses are sometimes as soundin^ and his thoughts as high:
for upon seri^u^ c^^sidera^ion I cannot mind what part of all the Heroicks is
so strong and sounding as that Idyllium on ^ercules (...) in which Hercules
himself tells ^hyleus how he killed the Lion whose Skin he were: for, not to
m^^^^on many, what can be greater than this expression.

And gaping ^ell received his mighty Soul: Why should* instance in the (...),
which has no^ ^n^^^ne below Heroic; the greatness of this is almost
inexpressible.

(...). And some other pieces are as strong as these, such is the Panegyric on
Ptolemy, Helen's Epithalamium, and the fight of young Hercules and the Snakes:
now how is it likely that such Subjects should be fit for Pastorals, of which,
in my opinion, the same may be said which Ovid does of his Cydippe.

Cydippe, Homer, does not fit thy Muse. For certainly Pastorals ought not to
rise to the Majesty of Heroicks: but who on the other side dares reprehend such
great and judicious Authors, whose very doing it is Authority enough? What
shall I say of Virgil? who in his Sixth Eclogue has put together almost all
the particulars of the fabulous Age; what is so high to which Silenus that
Master of Mysterys does not soar?

For lo! he sung the Worlds stupendous birth,
How scattered seeds of Sea, of Air, and Earth,
And purer Fire through universal night
And empty space did fruitfully unite:
From whence the innumerable race of things
By circular successive order springs:
And afterward How Pyrra's Stony race rose from the ground,
And Saturn reigned with Golden plenty crowned,
How bold Prometheus (whose untamed desire,
Rival^d the Sun with his own Heavenly Fire)
Now doomed the Scythian Vulturs endless prey
Severely pays for Animating Clay.


So true, so certain it is, that nothing is so high and lofty to which Bucolicks
may not successfully aspire. But if this be so, what will becom^ of Macrobius,
Georgius Valla, Julius caliger, Vossius, and the whole company of Grammarians?
who all affirm that simplicity and meanness is so essential to Pastorals that
it ought to be confi^'d to the State, Manners, Apprehension and even common
phrases of Sheapards: for nothing c^n be said to be Pastoral, which is not
accommodated to their condition: and for this Reason Nannius Alcmaritanus in my
opinion is a trifler, who, in his comments on Virgils Eclogues, thinks that
those sorts of Composures may now and then be lofty, and treat of great
subjects: where he likewise divides the matter of Bucolicks, into Low, Middle,
and High and makes Virgil the Author of this Division, who in his Fourth
Eclogue, (as he imagines) divides the matter of Bucolicks into Three sorts, and
intimates this division by these three words: Bushes, Shrubs and Woods.

Sicilian Muse begin a loftier strain,
The Bushes and the Shrubs that shade the Plain
Delight not all; if I to Woods repair
My Song shall make them worth a Consuls Care.
By Woods, as he fancys, as Virgil means high and stately Trees, so He would
have a great and lofty Subject to to be employed, such as he designed for the
Consul: by Bushes, which are almost even with the ground, the meanest and
lowest argument; and by Shrubs a Subject not so high as the one, nor so low as
the other, as the thing itself is. And therefore these lines If I to Woods
repair
My Song shall make them worth a Consuls care.
are thus to be understood, That if we choose high and sublime arguments, our
work will be fit for the Patronage of a Consul, This is Nanniu's interpretation
of that place; too pedantial and subtle I Am afraid, for it is not credible
that ever Virgil thought of reckoning great and lofty things amongst the
Subjects of bucolicks especially since When his Thalia raised her bolder Voice
And Kings and Battles were her lofty choice,
Phoebus did twitch his Ear, mean thoughts infuse,
And with this whisper checked the inspiring Muse:
A Sheapard, Tityrus, his Sheep should feed,
And choose a Subject suited to his reed,


This certainly was a serious admonition employed by the twitching of his Ear,
and I believe if he had continued in this former humor and not obeyed the
smarring admonition. He had still felt it: so far was he from thinking Kings
and Battles fit Themes for a Sheapards song: and this evidently shows that in
Virgils opinion, contrary to Nanniu's fancy, great things cannot in the least
be comprehended within the subject matter of Pastorals; no, it must be low and
humble, which Theocritus very happily expresses by this word (...) i. e. as
the interpreters explain it, sing humble Strains.

Theefore let Pastoral never venture upon a lofty subject, let it not recede
one jot from its proper matter, but be employed about Rustic affairs: such as
are mean and humble in themselves; and such are the affairs of Shepherds,
especially their Loves, but those must be pure and innocent; not disturbed by
vain suspicious jealousy, nor polluted by Rapes; The Rivals must not fight, and
their emulations must be without quarrellings: such as Vida meant.

Whilst on his Reed he Shepherds stifes conveys,
And soft complaints in smooth Sicilian lays.
To these may be added Sports, Jests, Gifts, and Presents; but not costly, such
are yellow Apples, young stock-Doves, Milk, Flowers, and the like; all things
must appear delightful and easy, nothing vicious and rough: A persidious Pimp,
a designing Jilt, a gripeing Usurer, a crafty factious Servant must have no
room there, but every part must be full of the simplicity of the Golden-Age,
and of that Candor which was then eminent: for as Juvenal affirms Baseness was
a great wonder in that Age; Sometimes Funeral-Rites are the subject of an
Eclogue, where the Shepherds scatter flowers on the Tomb, and sing Rustic
Songs in honor of the Dead: Examples of this kind are left us by Virgil in his
Daphnis, and Bion in his Adonis, and this has nothing disagreeable to a
Shepherd: In short whatever, the decorum being still preserved, can be done by
a Sheapard, may be the Subject of a Pastoral.

Now there may be more kinds of Subjects than Servius or Donatus allow, for
they confine us to that Number which Virgil has made use of, tho Minturnus in
his second Book de Poeta declares against this opinion: But as a glorious
Heroic action must be the Subject of an Heroic Poem, so a Pastoral action of
a Pastoral; at least it must be so turned and wrought, that it might appear to
be the action of a Shepherd; which caution is very necessary to be observed, to
clear a great many difficulties in this matter: for tho as the Interpreters
assure us; most of Virgils Eclogues are about the Civil war, planting Colonys,
the murder of the Emperor, and the like, which in themselves are too great and
too lofty for humble Pastoral to reach, yet because they are accomodated to the
Genius of Shepherds, may be the Subject of an Eclogue, for that sometimes will
admit of Gods and Heroes so they appear like, and are shrouded under the
Persons of Shepherds: But as for these matters which neither really are, nor
are so wrought as to seem the actions of Shepherds, such are in Moschus's
Europa, Theocritus's Epithalamium of Helen, and Virgil's Pollio, to declare my
opinion freely, I cannot think them to be fit Subjects for Bucolicks: And upon
this account I suppose it is that Servius in his Comments on Virgil's Bucolicks
reckons only seven of Virgil's ten Eclogues, and only ten of Theocritus's
thirty, to be pure Pastorals, and Salmasius upon Solinus says, that amongst
Theocritus's Poems there are some which you may call what you please Beside
Pastorals: and Heinsius in his scholia upon Theocritus will allow but Ten of
his Idylliums to be Bucoliks, 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.11. for all the rest are
deficient either in matter or form, and from this number of pure pastoral
Idylliums I am apt to think, that Theocritus seems to have made that Pipe, on
which he tuned his Pastorals and which he consecrated to Pan of ten Reeds, as
Salmasius in his notes on Theocritus's Pipe has learnedly observed: in which
two Verses always make one Reed of the Pipe, therefore all are so unequal, like
the unequal Reeds of a Pipe, that if you put two equals together which make one
Reed, the whole inequality consists in ten pairs; when in the common Pipes
there were usually no more then seven Reeds, and this the less curious
observers have heedlessly past by

Some are of opinion that whatever is done in the Country, and in one word,
every thing that has naught of the City in it may be treated o^ in Pastorals;
and that the discourse of Fishers, Plow-men, Reapers, Hunters, and the like,
belong to this kind of Poetry: which according to the Rule that I have laid
down cannot be true for, as I before hinted nothing but the action of a
Shepherd can be the Subject of a Pastoral.

I shall not here enquire, tho it may seem proper whether we can decently bring
into an Eclogue Reapers, Vine-dressers, Gardners, Fowlers, Hunters, Fishers, or
the like, whose lives for the most part are taken up with too much business and
employment to have any vacant time for Songs, and idle Chat, which are more
agreeable to the leisure of a Sheapards Life: for in a great many Rustic
affairs, either the hardship and painful Labor will not admit a song, as in
Plowing, or the solitude as in hunting, Fishing, Fowling, and the like; but of
this I shall discourse more largely in another place.

Now it is not sufficient to make a Poem a true Pastoral, that the Subject of it
is the action of a Shepherd, for in Hesiods (...) and Virgils Georgicks there
are a great many things that belong to the employment of a Shepherd, yet none
fancy they are Pastorals; from whence it is evident, that beside the matter,
which we have defined to be the action of a Sheapard, there is a peculiar Form
proper to this kind of Poetry by which it is distinguished from all others.

Of Poetry in General Socrates, as Plato tells us, would have Fable to be the
Form: Aristotle Imitation: I shall not dispute what difference there is between
these two, but only inquire whether Imitation be the Form of Pastoral: It Is
certain that Epick Poetry is differenc't from Tragic only by the manner of
imitation, for the latter imitates by action, and the former by bare narration:
But Pastoral is the imitation of a Pastoral action either by bare narration, as
in Virgil^s Alexis, and Theocritus's 7th Idyllium, in which the Poet speaks all
along in his own Person: or by action as in Virgil's Tityrus and the first of
Theocritus, or by both mixed, as in the Second and Eleventh Idylliums, in which
the Poe^ partly speaks in his own Person, and partly makes, others speak, and I
think the old Scholiast on ^heocritus took an hint from these when he says,
that ^astoral is a mixture made up of all sorts, for it is Narrative, Dramatick,
and mixed, and Aristotle, tho obscurely, seems to h^nt in those words, In every
one of the mentioned Arts there is Imitation, in some simple, in some mixed; now
this latter being peculiar to Bucolicks makes its very form and Essence: and
therefore Scaliger, in the 4 th Chapter of his first Book of Poetry, reckons up
three Species of Pastorals, the first has but one Person, the second several,
which sing alternately; the third is mixed of both the other: And the same
observation is made by Heinsius in his Notes on Theocritus, for thus he very
plainly to our purpose, the Character of Bucolicks is a mixture of all sorts of
Characters, Dramatick, Narrative, or mixed: from all which it is very manif^st
that the manner of Imitation which is proper to Pastorals is the mixed: for in
other kinds of Poetry it is one and simple, at least not so manifold; as in
Tragedy Action: in Epick Poetry Narration.

Now I shall explain what sort of Fable; Manners, Thought, Expression, which
four are necessary to consstitute every kind of Poetry, are proper to this sort.

Concerning the Fable which Aristotle calls (...), I have but one thing to say:
this, as the Philosopher hints, as of all other sorts of Poetry, so of Pastoral
is the very Soul: and therefore Socrates in Plato says, that in those Verses
which he had made there was nothing wanting but the Fable: therefore Pastorals
as other kinds of Poetry must have their Fable, if they will be Poetry: Thus in
Virgil's Silenus which contains the Stories of almost the whole Fabulous Age,
two Shepherds whom Silenus had often promised a Song, and as often deceived,
seize upon him being drunk and asleep, and bind him with wreathed Flowers;
Aegle comes in and incourages the timorous youths, and stains his jolly red
F^ce with Black berries, Silenus laughs at their innocent contrivance, and
desires to be unbound, and then with a premedi^ated Song satisfies the Nymph's
and Boys Curiosity; The incomparable Poet sings wonders, the Rocks rejoice, the
Vales echo, and happy Eurotas as if Phoebus himself sang, hears all, and bids
the Laurels that grow upon his Banks listen to, and learn the Song.

Happy Eurotas as he flowed along
Heard all, and bad the Laurels learn the Song.
Thus every Eclogue or Idyllium must have its Fable, which must be the
groundwork of the whole design, but it must not be perplexed with sudden and
unlookt for changes, as in Marinus's Adonis: for that, tho the Fable be of a
Shepherd, yet by reason of the strange Bombast under Plots, and wonderful
occurences, cannot be accounted Pastoral; for that it might be agreeable to the
Person it treats of, it must be plain and simple, such as Sophocles's Ajax, in
which there ls not so much as one change of Fortune.

As for the Manners, let that precept, which Horace lays down in his Epistle to
the Pisones, be principally observed.

Let each be graced with that which suits him best. For this, as it is a rule
relateing to Poetry in general, so it respect this kind also of which we are
treating; and against this Tasso in his Amyntas, Bonarellus in his Phyllis,
Guarinus in his Pastor Fido, Marinus in his Idylliums, and most of the Italians
grievously offend, for they make their Shepherds too polite, and elegant, and
cloth them with all the neatness of the Town, and Complement of the Court,
which tho it may seem very pretty, yet amongst good Critics, let Veratus say
what he will in their excuse, it cannot be allowed: For it is against
Minturnus's Opinion, who in his second Book de Poeta says thus: Mean Persons
are brought in, those in Comedy indeed more polite, those in Pastorals more
unelegant, as supposed to lead a rude life in Solitude; and Jason Denor a
Doctor of Padua takes notice of the same as a very absurd Error: Aristotle
heretofore for a like fault reprehended the Megarensians, who observed no
Decorum in their Theater, but brought in mean persons with a Train fit for a
King, and clothed a Cobbler or Tinker in a Purple Robe: Invain does Veratus in
his Dispute against Jason Denor, to defend those elaborately exquisite
discourses, and notable sublime sentences of his Pastor Fido, bring some lofty
Idylliums of Theocritus, for those are not acknowledged to be Pastoral;
Theocritus and Virgil must be consulted in this matter, the former designdly
makes his Shepherds discourse in the Dorick i. e. the Rustic Dialect,
sometimes scarce true Grammar; and the other studiously affects ignorance in
the persons of his Shepherds, as Servius has observed, and is evident in
Meliboeus, who makes Oaxes to be a River in Crete when it is in Mesopotamia: and
both of them take this way that the Manners may the more exactly suit with the
Persons they represent, who of themselves are rude and unpolisht: And this
proves that they scandalously err, who make their Shepherds appear polite and
elegant, nor can I imagine what Veratus who makes so much ado about the polite
manners of the Arcadian Shepherds, would say to Polybius who tells us that the
Arcadians by reason of the Mountainousness of the Country and hardness of the
weather, are very unsociable and austere.

Now as too much neatness in Pastoral is not to be allowed, so rusticity (I do
not mean that which Plato, in his Third Book of a Commonwealth, mentions which
is but a part of a down right honesty) but Clownish stupidity, such as
Theophrastus, in his Character of a Rustic, describes; or that disagreeable
unfashionable roughness which Horace mentions in his Epistle to Lollius, must
not in my opinion be endured: On this side Mantuan errs extremely, and is
intolerably absurd, who makes Shepherds blockishly sottish, and insufferably
rude: And a certain Interpreter blames Theocritus for the same thing, who in
some men's opinion sometimes keeps too close to the Clown, and is rustic and
uncouth; But this may be very well excused because the Age in which he sang was
not as polite as now.

But that every Part may be suitable to a Shepherd, we must consult unstained,
uncorrupted Nature; so that the manners might not be too Clownish nor too
Caurtly: And this mean may be easily observed if the manners of our Shepherds
be represented according to the Genius of the golden Age, in which, if Guarinus
may be believed, every man followed that employment: And Nannius in the Preface
to his Comments on Virgils Bucolicks is of the same opinion, for he requires
that the manners might represent the Golden Age: and this was the reason that
Virgil himself in his Pollio describes that Age, which he knew very well was
proper to Bucolicks: For in the whole course of a Shepherds life there can be
no form more excellent than that which was the practice of the Golden Age; And
this may serve to moderate and temper the affections that must be expressed in
this sort of Poetry, and sufficiently declare the whole Essence of it, which in
short must be taken from the nature of a Shepherds life to which a Cou^tly
dress is not agreeable.

That the Thought may be commendable, it must be suitable to the manners; as
those must be plain and pure that must be so too: nor must contain any, ^eep,
exquisite, or elaborate fancies: And against this the Italians offend, who
continually hunt after smart witty sayings, very foolishly in my opinion; for
in the Country, where all things should be full of plainess and simplicity who
would paint or endeavor to be gaudy when such appearan^es would be very
disagreeable and offend? Pontanus in this matter has said very well, The
Thought must not be to exquisite and witty, the Comparisons obvious and common,
such as the State of Persons and Things require: Yet tho too scrupulous a
Curiosity in Ornament ought to be rejected, yet lest the Thought be cold and
flat, it must have some quickness of Passion, as in these. Cruel Alexis cannot
my Verses move?
Have thou no Pity? I must dye for Love.
And again,

He neither Gods, nor yet my Verse regards. The Sense must not be long,
copious, and continued, For Pastoral is weak, and not able to hold out; but of
this more when I come to lay down rules for its Composure: But tho it ought to
imitate Comedy in its common way of discourse, yet it must not chose old Comedy
for its pattern, for that is too impudent, and licentiously abusive: Let it be
free and modest, honest and ingenuous, and that will make it agreeable to the
Golden Age.

Let the Expression be plain and easy, but elegant and neat, and the purest
which the language will afford; Pontanus upon Virgils Bucolicks gives the very
same rule, In Bucolicks the Expression must be humble, nearer common discourse
than otherwise, not very Spirituous and vivid, yet such as shows life and
strength: It Is certain that Virgil in his Bucolicks uses the same words which
Tully did in the Forum or the Senate: and Tityrus beneath his shady Beech
speaks as pure and good Latin as Augustus in his Palace, as Modicius in his
Apology for Virgil has excellently observed: This rule, it is true; Theocritus
has not so strictly followed, whose Rustic and Pastoral Muse, as Quintilian
phraseth it, not only is afraid to appear in the Forum, but the City: and for
the very same thing an Alexandrian flouts the Syracucusian Weomen in the
Fifteenth Idyllium of Theocritus, for when they, being then in the City, spoke
the Dorick Dialect, the delicate Citizen could not endure it, and found fault
with their distastful, as he thought, pronunciation: and his reflection was
very smart.

Like Pigeons you have mouths from Ear to Ear. So intolerable did that broad
way of pronunciation, tho exactly fit for a Clowns discourse, seem to a
Citizen: and hence Probus observes that 'twas much harder for the Latins to
write Pastorals, than for the Greeks; because the Latins had not some Dialects
peculiar to the Country, and others to the City, as the Greeks had; Besides the
Latin Language, as Quintilian has observed, is not capable of the neatness
which is necessary to Bucolicks, no, that is the peculiar privilege of the
Greeks: We cannot, says he, be so low, they exceed us in subtlety, and in
propriety they are at more certainty than We: and again, in pat and close
Expressions we cannot reach the Greeks. And, if we believe Tully, Greek is much
more fit for Ornament than Latin, for it has much more of that neatness, end
and ravishing delightfulness, which Bucolicks necessarily require.

Yet of Pastoral, with whose Nature we are not very well acquainted, what that
Form is which the Greeks call the Character, is not very easy to determine; yet
that we may come to some certainty, we must stick to our former observation,
viz. that Pastoral belongs properly to the Golden Age: For as Tully in his
Treatise de Oratore says, in all our disputes the subject is to be measured by
the most perfect of that kind, and Syncsius in his Encomium on Baldness hints
the very same, when he tells us that Poetry fashions its subject as Men imagine
it should be, and not as really it is: (...): Now the Life of a Shepherd, that
it might be raised to the highest perfection, is to be referred to the manners
and age of the world whilst yet innocent, and such as the Fables have described
it: And as Simplicity was the principal virtue of that Age, so it ought to be
the peculiar Grace, and as it were Character of Bucolicks: in which the Fable,
Manners, Thought, and Expression ought to be full of the most innocent
simplicity imaginable: for as Innocence in Life, so purity and simplicity in
discourse was the Glory of that Age: So as gravity to Epicks, Sweetness to
Lyricks, Humor to Comedy, softness to Elegies, and smartness to Epigrams, so
simplicity to Pastorals is proper; and one upon Theocritus says, that the Idea
of his Bucolicks is in every part pure, and in all that belongs to simplicity
very happy: Such is this of Virgil, unwholesome to us Singers is the shade Of
Juniper, it is an unwholesome shade: Than which in my opinion nothing can be more
simply; nothing more rustically said; and this is the reason I suppose why
Macrobius says that this kind of Poetry is creeping and upon mean subjects: and
why too Virgils Tityrus lying under his shady Beech displeases some; Excellent
Critics indeed, whom I wish a little more sense, that they might not really
be, what they would not seem to be, Ridiculous: Theocritus excells Virgil in
this, of whom Modicius says, Theocritus deserves tht greatest commendation for
his happy imitation of the simplicity of his Shepherds, Virgil has mixed
Allegories, and some other things which contain too much learning, and deepness
of Thought for Persons of so mean a Quality: Yet here I must obviate their
mistake who fancy that this sort of Poetry, because in it self low and simple,
is the proper work of mean Wits, and not the most sublime and excellent
perfections: For as I think there be can nothing more elegant than easy naked
simplicity, so likewise nothing can require more strength of Wit, and greater
pains; and he must be of a great and clear judgment, who attempts Pastoral, and
comes of with Honor: For there is no part of Poetry that requires more spirit,
for if any part is not close and well compacted the whole Fabric will be
ruined, and the matter, in it self humble, must creep; unless it is held up by
the strength and vigor of the Expression.

Another qualification and excellence of Pastoral is to imitate Timanthes's
Art, of whom Pliny writes thus; Timanthes was very Ingenious, in all his pieces
more was to be understood than the Colors expressed, and tho his Art was very
extraordinary yet his fancy exceeded it: In this Virgil is peculiarly happy,
but others, especially raw unexperienced Writers, if they are to describe a
Rainbow, or a River, pour out their whole stock, and are unable to contain: Now
it is properly requisite to a Pastoral that there should be a great deal coucht
in a few words, and every thing it says should be so short, and so close, as if
its chiefest excellence was to be spareing in Expression: such is that of
Virgil; These Fields and Corn shall a Barbarian share?
See the Effects of all our Civil War.


How short is that? how concise? and yet how full of sense in the same Eclogue.

I wondered why all thy complaints were made,
Absent was Tityrus:
And the like you may every where meet with, as Mopsus weds Nisa, what may not
Lovers hope? and in the second Eclogue.

Whom do thou fly ah frantic! often the Woods
Hold Gods, and Paris equal to the Gods.
This Grace Virgil learned from Theocritus, almost all whose Periods;
especially in the third Idyllium have no conjunction to connect them, that the
sense might be more close, and the Affection vehement and strong: as in this
Let all things change, let Pears the Firs adorn
Now Daphnis dies.


And in the third Eclogue.

But when she saw, how great was the surprise! etc. And any one may find a
great many of the like in Theocritus and Virgil, if with a leisurely delight he
nicely examines their delicate Composures: And this I account the greatest
grace in Pastorals, which in my opinion those that write Pastorals do not
sufficiently observe: It Is true Ours (the French) and the Italian language is to
babbling to endure it; This is the Rock on which those that write Pastorals in
their Mother tongue are usually split, But the Italians are inevitably lost;
who having store of Wit, a very subtle invention and flowing fancy, cannot
contain; every thing that comes into their mind must be poured out, nor are
they able to endure the least restraint: as is evident from Marinus's
Idylliums, and a great many of that nation who have ventured on such
composures: For unless there are many and breakings off in the series of a
Pastoral, it can neither be pleasing nor artificial: And in my Opinion Virgil
excells Theocritus in this, for Virgil is neither so continued, nor so long as
Theocritus; who indulges too much the garrulity of his Greek; nay even in those
things which he expresses he is more close, and more cautiously conceals that
part which ought to be dissembled: And this I am sure is a most admirable part
of Eloquence; as Tully in his Epistle to Atticus says, It Is rare to speak
Eloquently, but more rare to be eloquently silent: And this unskillful Critics
are not acquainted with, and therefore are wont oftener to find fault with that
which is not fitly expressed, than commend that which is prudently concealed: I
could heap up a great many more things to this purpose, but I see no need of
such a trouble, since no man can rationally doubt of the goodness of my
Observation: Therefore, in short, let him that writes Pastorals think brevity,
if it does not obscure his sense, to be the greatest grace which he can attain.

Now why Bucolicks should require such Brevity, and be so essentially sparing
in Expression, I see no other reason but this; It loves Simplicity so much that
it must be averse to that Pomp and Ostentation which Epick Poetry must show,
for that must be copious and flowing, in every part smooth, and equal to it
self: But Pastoral must dissemble, and hide even that which it would show, like
Damon's Galatea, who flies then when she most desires to be discovered.

And to the Bushes flys, yet would be seen. And this does not proceed from any
malicious ill-natured Coyness, as some imagine, but from an ingenuous modesty
and bashfulness, which usually accompanies, and is a proof of Simplicity: It Is
very rare, says Pliny, to find a man so exquisitely skillful, as to be able to
show those Features in a Picture which he hides; and I think it to be so
difficult a task, that none but the most excellent Wits can attempt it with
success: For small Wits usually abound with a multitude of words.

The third Grace of Bucolicks is Neatness, which contains all the taking
prettiness and sweetness of Expression, and whatsoever is called the Delicacies
of the more delightful and pleasing Muses: This the Rural Muses bestowed on
Virgil, as Horace in the tenth Satyr of his first Book says, And Virgils happy
Muse in Eclogues plays,
Soft and facetious;
Which Fabius takes to signify the most taking neatness and most exquisite
Elegance imaginable: For thus he explains this place, in which he agrees with
Tully, who in his Third Book de Oratore, says, the Atticks are Facetious i. e.
elegant: Tho the common Interpreters of these words are not of the same mind:
But if by Facetious Horace had meant jesting, and such as is designed to make
men laugh, and applied that to Virgil, nothing could have been more ridiculous;
it is the design of Comedy to raise laughter, but Eclogue should only delight,
and charm by its taking prettiness: All ravishing Delicacies of Thought, all
sweetness of Expression, all that Salt from which Venus, as the Poets Fable,
rose; are so essential to this kind of Poetry, that it cannot endure any thing
that is scurillous, maliciously biteing, or ridiculous: There must be nothing
in it but Honey, Milk, Roses, Violets, and the like sweetness, so that when you
read you might think that you are in Adonis's Gardens, as the Greeks speak, i.
e. in the most pleasant place imaginable: For since the subject of Eclogue must
be mean and unsurprizing, unless it maintains purity and neatness of
Expression, it cannot please.

Therefore it must do as Tully says his friend Atticus did, who entertaining
his acquaintance with Leeks and Onions, pleased them all very well, because he
had them served up in wicker Chargers, and clean Baskets; So let an Eclogue
serve up its fruits and flowers with some, tho no costly imbellishment, such as
may answer to the wicker Chargers, and Baskets; which may be provided at a
cheap rate, and are agreeable to the Country: yet, (and this rule if you aim at
exact simplicity, can never be too nicely observed,) you must most carefully
avoid all paint and gawdiness of Expression, and, (which of all sorts of
Elegancies is the most difficult to be avoided) you must take the greatest care
that no scrupulous trimness; or artificial finessess appear: For, as Quintilian
teaches, in some cases diligence and care are most troublesomly perverse; and
when things are most sweet they are next to loathsome and many times
degenerate: Therefore as in Weomen a careless dress becomes some extremely.
Thus Pastoral, that it might not be uncomely, ought sometimes to be negligent,
or the finess of its ornaments ought not to appear and lie open to every bodies
view: so that it ought to affect a studied carelessness, and designed
negligence: And that this may be, all gawdiness of Dress, such as Paint and
Curls, all artificial shining is to be despised, but in the mean time care must
be taken that the Expression be bright and simply clean, not filthy and
disgustful, but such as is varnisht with Wit and Fancy: Now to perfect this,
Nature is chiefly to be looked upon, (for nothing that is disagreeable to Nature
can please) yet that will hardly prevail naked, by it self, and without the
polishing of Art.

Then there are three things in which, as in its parts, the whole Character of
a Pastoral is contained: Simplicity of Thought and expression: Shortness of
Periods full of sense and spirit: and the Delicacy of a most elegant ravishing
unaffected neatness.

Next I will enquire into the Efficient, and then into the Final Cause of
Pastorals.

Aristotle assigns two efficient Causes of Poetry, The natural desire of
Imitation in Man whom he calls the most imitative Creature; and Pleasure
consequent to that Imitation: Which indeed are the Remote Causes, but the
Immediate are Art and Nature; Now according to the differences of Genius's
several Species of Poetry have been introduced: For as the Philosopher has
observed, (...) Thus those that were lofty imitated great and Illustrious;
those that were low spirited and grovelling mean Actions: And every one,
according to the various inclination of his Nature, followed this or that sort
of Poetry: This the Philosopher expressly affirms, And Dio Chrysostomus says of
Homer that he received from the Gods a Nature fit for all sorts of Verse: but
this is an happiness which none partake but, as he in the same place intimates,
Godlike minds.

Not to mention other kinds of Poetry, what particular Genius is required to
Pastoral I think, is evident from the foregoing Discourse, for as every part of
it ought to be full of simple and inartificial neatness, so it requires a Wit
naturally neat and pleasant, born to delight and ravish, which are the
qualifications certainly of a great and most excellent Nature: For whatsoever
in any kind is delicate and elegant, that is usually most excellent: And such a
Genius that has a sprightfulness of Nature, and is well instructed by the
rules of Art, is fit to attempt Pastorals.

Of the end of Pastorals it is not so easy to give an account: For as to the end
of Poetry in General: The Enemies of Poets run out into a large common place,
and loudly tell us that Poetry is frivolous and unprofitable. Excellent men!
that love profit perchance, but have no regard for Honesty and Goodness; who do
not know that all excellent Arts sprang from Poetry at first.

Which what is honest, base, or just, or good,
Better than Crantor, or Chrysippus showed.
For it is Poetry that like a chaste unspotted Virgin, shows men the way, and the
means to live happily, who afterward are depraved by the immodest precepts of
vitiated and impudent Philosophy. For every body knows, that the Epick sets
before us the highest example of the Bravest man; the Tragedian regulates the
Affections of the Mind; the Lyrick reforms Manners, or sings the Praises of
Gods, and Heroes; so that there is no part of Poetry but has its proper end,
and profits.

But grant all this true, Pastoral can make no such pretense: if you sing a
Hero, you excite men's minds to imitate his Actions, and notable Exploits; but
how can Bucolicks apply these or the like advantages to its self? He that reads
Heroic Poems, learns what is the virtue of a Hero* and wishes to be like him;
but he that reads Pastorals, neither learns how to feed sheep, nor wishes
himself a Shepherd: And a great deal more to this purpose you may see in
Modicius, as Pontanus cites him in his Notes on Virgil's Eclogues.

But when it is the end of Comedy, as Jerome in his Epistle to Furia says, to know
the Humors of Men, and to describe them; and Demea in Terence intimates the
same thing, To look on all men's Lives as in a Glass,
And take from those Examples for our Own,
so that our Humors and Conversations may be bettered, and improved; why may
not Pastoral be allowed the same Privilege, and be admitted to regulate and
improve a Shepherd's life by its Bucolicks? For since it is a product of the
Golden Age, it will show the most innocent manners of the most ancient
Simplicity, how plain and honest, and how free from all varnish, and dece^t, to
more degenerate, and worse times: And certainly for this it is commendable in its
kind, since its design in drawing the image of a Country and Shepherd's life,
is to teach Honesty, Candor, and Simplicity, which are the virtues of private
men; as Epicks teach the highest Fortitude, and Prudence, and Conduct, which
are the virtues of Generals, and Kings. And it is necessary to Government, that
as there is one kind of Poetry to instruct the Citizens, there should be
another to fashion the manners of the Rusticks: which if Pastoral, as it does,
did not do, yet would it not be altogether frivolous, and idle, since by its
taking prettinesses it can delight, and please. It can scarce be imagined, how
much the most flourishing times of the Roman Commonwealth, in which Virgil
wrote, grew better and brisker by the use of Pastoral: with it were Augustus,
Mecaenas, Asinius Pollio, Alphenus Varus, Cornelius Gallus, the most admired
Wits of that happy Age, wonderfully pleased; for whatever is sweet, and
ravishing, is contained in this sweetest kind of Poetry. But if we must slight
every thing, from which no profit is to be hoped, all pleasures of the Eye and
Ear are presently to be laid aside; and those excellent Arts, Music, and
Painting, with which the best men use to be delighted, are presently to be left
off. Nor is it indeed credible, that so many excellent Wits, as have devoted
themselves to Poetry, would ever have meddled with it, if it had been so empty,
idle, and frivolous, as some ridiculously morose imagine; who forsooth are
better pleased with the severity of Philosophy, and her harsh, deformed
impropriety of Expressions. But the judgments of such men are the most
contemptible in the world; for when by Poetry men's minds are fashioned to
generous Humors, Kindness, and the like: those must needs be strangers to all
those good qualites, who hate, or proclaim Poetry to be frivolous, and useless.

The Third PART. Rules for writing Pastorals.
IN delivering Rules for writing Pastorals, I shall not point to the streams,
which to look after argues a small creeping Genius, but lead you to the
fountains. But first I must tell you, how difficult it is to write Pastorals,
which many seem not sufficiently to understand: For since its matter is low,
and humble, it seems to have nothing that is troublesome, and difficult. But
this is a great mistake, for, as Horace says of Comedy, It is by so much the
more difficult, by how much the less pardonable are the mistakes committed in
its composure: and the same is to be thought of every thing, whose end is to
please, and delight. For whatsoever is contrived for pleasure, and not
necessarily required, unle^s it be exquisite, must be nauseous, and distastful;
as at a Supper, scraping Music, thick Ointment, or the like, because the
Entertainment might have been without all these: For the sweetest things, and
most delicious, are most apt to satiate; for tho the sense may sometimes be
pleased, yet it presently disgusts that which is luscious, and, as Lucretius
phraseth it, Even in the midst and fury of the Joys,
Some thing that is better rises, and destroys.


Beside, since Pastoral is of that nature, that it cannot endure too much
negligence, nor too scrupulous diligence, it must be very difficult to to be
composed, especially since the expression must be neat, but not too exquisite,
and fine: It must have a simple native beauty, but not too mean: it must have
all sorts of delicacies, and surprising fancies, yet not be flowing, and
luxuriant. And certainly, to hit all these excellencies is difficult enough,
since Wit, whose nature it is to pour it self forth, must rather be restrained
than indulged; and that force of the Mind, which of it self is so ready to run
on, must be checked, and bridled: Which cannot be easily performed by any, but
those who have a very good Judgment, and practically skilled in Arts, and
Sciences: And lastly, a neat, and as it were a happy Wit; not that curious
sort, I mean, which Petronius allows Horace, lest too much Art should take off
the Beauty of the Simplicity. And therefore I would not have any one undertake
this task, that is not very polite by Nature, and very much at leisure. For
what is more hard than to be always in the Country, and yet never to be
Clownish? to sing of mean, and trivial matters, yet not trivially, and meanly?
to pipe on a slender Reed, and yet keep the sound from being harsh, and
squeaking? to make every thing sweet, yet never satiate?. And this I thought
necessary to premise, in order to the better laying down of such Rules as I
design. For the naked simplicity both of the Matter and Expression of a
Pastoral, upon bare Contemplation, might seem easily to be hit, but upon trial
'twill be found a very hard task: Nor was the difficulty to be dissembled, lest
Ignorance should betray some into a rash attempt. Now I must come to the very
Rules; for as nothing excellent can be brought to perfection without Nature,
(for Art unassisted by that, is vain, and ineffectual,) so there is no Nature
so excellent, and happy, which by its own strength, and without Art and Use can
make any thing excellent, and great.

But it is hard to give Rules for that, for which there have been none already
given; for where there are no footsteps nor path to direct, I cannot tell how
any one can be certain of his way. Yet in this difficulty I will follow
Aristotle's Example, who being to lay down Rules concerning Epicks, proposed
Homer as a Pattern, from whom he deduced the whole Art: So I will gather from
Theocritus and Virgil, those Fathers of Pastoral, what I shall deliver on this
account. For all the Rules that are to be given of any Art, are to be given of
it as excellent, and perfect, and therefore ought to be taken from them in whom
it is so.

The first Rule shall be about the Matter, which is either the Action of a
Shepherd, or contrived and fitted to the Genius of a Shepherd; for tho Pastoral
is simple, and bashful, yet it will entertain lofty subjects, if it can be
permitted to turn and fashion them to its own proper Circumstances, and Humor:
which tho Theocritus has never done, but kept close to pastoral simplicity,
yet Virgil has happily attempted; of whom almost the same Character might be
given, which Quintilian bestowed ^n Stesichorus, who with his Harp bore up the
most weighty subjects of Epick Poetry; for Virgil sang great and lofty things
to his Oaten Reed, but yet suited to the Humor of a Shepherd, for every thing
that is nor agreeable to that, cannot belong to Pastoral: of its own nature it
cannot treat of lofty and great matters.

Therefore let Pastaral be smooth and soft, not noisy and bombast; lest whilst
it raises its voice, and opens its mouth, it meet with the same fate that,
they say, an Italian Shepherd did, who having a very large mouth, and a very
strong breath, brake his Pipe as often as he blowed it. This is a great fault
in one that writes Pastorals: for if his words are too sounding, or his sense
too strong, he must be absurd, because indecently loud. And this is not the
rule of an unskilful impertinent Adviser, but rather of a very excellent Master
in this Art; for Phoebus twitcht Virgil by the Ear, and warned him to forbear
great Subjects: but if it ventures upon such, it may be allowed to use some
short Invocations, and, as Epicks do, modestly implore the assistance of a
Muse. This Virgil does in his Pollio, which is a Composure of an unusual
loftiness: Sicilian Muse begin a loftier strain.

So he invocates Arethusa, when Cornelius Gallus Proconsul of Egypt and his
Amors, matters above the common reach of Pastoral, are his Subject.

One Labor more O Arethusa yield. Why he makes his application to Aretheusa is
easy to conjecture, for she was a Nymph of Sicily, and so he might hope that
she could inspire him with a Genius fit for Pastorals which first began in that
Island, Thus in the seventh and eighth Eclogue, as the matter would bear, he
invocates the Nymphs and Muses: And Theocritus does the same, Tell Goddess, you
can tell.

From whence it is evident that in Pastoral, tho it never pretends to any
greatness, Invocations may be allowed: But whatever Subject it chooses, it
must take care to accommodate it to the Genius and Circumstances of a Shepherd.

Concerning the Form, or mode of Imitation, I shall not repeat what I have
already said, viz. that this is in it self mixed; for Pastoral is either
Alternate, or has but one Person, or is mixed of both: yet it is properly and
chiefly Alternate, as is evident from that of Theocritus.

Sing Rural strains, for as we march along
We may delight each other with a Song.
In which the Poet shows that alternate singing is proper to a Pastoral: But as
for the Fable, it is requisite that it should be simple, lest in stead of
Pastoral it put on the form of a Comedy, or Tragedy if the Fable be great, or
intricate: It must be One; this Aristotle thinks necessary in every Poem, and
Horace lays down this general Rule, Be every Fable simple, and but one: For
every Poem, that is not One, is imperfect, and this Unity is to be taken from
the Action: for if that is One, the Poem will be so too. Such is the Passion of
Corydon in Virgil's second Eclogue, Meliboeus's Expostulation with Tityrus
about his Fortune; Theocritus's Thyrsis, Cyclops, and Amaryllis, of which
perhaps in its proper place I may treat more largely.

Let the third Rule be concerning the Expression, which cannot be in this kind
excellent unless borrowed from Theocritus's Idylliums, or Virgil's Eclogues;
let it be chiefly simple, and ingenuous: such is that of Theocritus, A Kid
belongs to thee, and Kids are good, Or that in Virgil's seventh Eclogue, This
Pail of Milk, these Cakes (Priapus) every year
Expect; a little Garden is thy care:
You Are Marble now, but if more Land I hold,
If my Flock thrive, thou shall be made of Gold,
than which I cannot imagine more simple, and more ingenuous expressions. To
which may be added that out of his Palemon, And I love Phyllis, for her Charms
excel;
At my departure O what tears there fell!
She sighed, Farewell Dear Youth, a long Farewell.


Now, That I call an ingenuous Expression which is clear and smooth, that
swells with no insolent words, or bold metaphors, but has something familiar,
and as it were obvious in its Composure, and not disguised by any studied and
affected, dress: All its Ornament must be like the Corn and fruits in the
Country, easy to be gotten, and ready at hand, not such as requires Care,
Labor, and Cost to be obtained: as Hermogenes on Theocritus observes; See how
easy and unaffected this sounds, Pines murmurings, Goatherd, are a pleasing
sound, and most of his expressions, not to say all, are of the same nature: for
the ingenuous simplicity both of Thought and Expression is the natural
Characteristick of Pastoral. In this Theocritus and Virgil are admirable, and
excellent, the others despicable, and to be pitied: for they being enfeebled
by the meaness of their subject, either creep, or fall flat. Virgil keeps
himself up by his choice and curious words, and tho his matter for the most
part (and Pastoral requires it) is mean, yet his expressions never flag, as is
evident from these lines in his Alexis: The glossy Plums I Will bring, and juicy
Pear,
Such as were once delightful to my Dear:
I Will crop the Laurel, and the Myrtle tree,
Confusedly set, because their Sweets agree.


For since the matter must be low, to avoid being abject, and despicable, you
must borrow some light from the Expression; not such as is dazzling, but pure,
and lambent, such as may shine through the whole matter, but never flash, and
blind. The words of such a Style we are usually taught in our Nurses arms, but
it is to be perfected and polished by length of time, frequent use, study, and
diligent reading of the most approved Authors: for Pastoral is apt to be
slighted for the meaness of its Matter, unless it has some additional Beauty,
be pure, polisht, and so made pleasing, and attractive. Therefore never let any
one, that designs to write Pastorals, corrupt himself with foreign manners; for
if he has once vitiated the healthful habit, as I may say, of Expression,
which Bucolicks necessarily require, it is impossible he should be fit for that
task. Yet let him not affect pompous or dazzling Expressions, for such belong to
Epicks, or Tragedians Let his words sometimes taste of the Country, not that I
mean, of which Volusius's Annals, upon which Catullus has made that biting
Epigram, are full; for though the Thought ought to be rustic, and such as is
suitable to a Shepherd, yet it ought not to be Clownish, as is evident in
Corydon, when he makes mention of his Goats.

Young sportive Creatures, and of spotted hue,
Which suckled twice a day, I keep for you:
These Thestilis has begged, and begged in vain,
But now they are Hers, since You my Gifts disdain.
For what can be more Rustical, than to design those Goats for Alexis, at that
very time when he believes Thestylis's winning importunity will be able to
prevail? yet there is nothing Clownish in the words. In short, Bucolicks should
deserve that commendation which Tully gives Crassus, of whose Orations he would
say, that nothing could be more free from childish painting, and affected
finery. So let the Expression in Pastoral be without gaudy trappings, and all
those little fineries of Art, which are used to set off and varnish a
discourse: But let an ingenuous Simplicity, and unaffected pleasing Neatness
appear in every part; which yet will be flat, if it is drawn out to any length,
if not close, short, and broken, as that in Virgil, He that loves Bavius
Verses, hates not Thine: And in the same Eclogue, -- It is not safe to drive
too nigh,
The Bank may fail, the Ram is hardly dry:
And in Corydon, To learn this Art what will not Amyntas do?

And in Theocritus much of the same nature may be seen; as in his other
Pastoral Idylliums, so chiefly in his fifth. Thus Battus in the fourth
Idyllium, complaining for the loss of Amaryllis, Dear Nymph, dear as my Goats,
you died. And how soft and tender is that in the third Idyllium, And she may
look on me, she may be won,
She may be kind, She is not perfect Stone,
And in this concise, close way of Expression lies the chiefest Grace of
Pastorals: for in my opinion there is nothing in the whole Composition that can
delight more than those frequent stops, and breakings off. Yet lest in these
too it become dull and sluggish, it must be quickened by frequent lively touches
of Concernment: such as that of the Goatherd in the third Idyllium, -- I see
that I must die: Or Daphnis's despair, which Thyrsis sings in the first
Idyllium, Ye Wolves, and Pards, and Mountain Bores adieu,
The Herdsmen now must walk no more with You.
How tender are the lines, and yet what passion they contain! And most of
Virgil's are of this nature, but there are likewise in him some touches of
despairing Love, such as is this of Alphesiboeus, Nor have I any mind to be
relieved: Or that of Damon, I Will die, yet tell my Love even whilst I die: Or that
of Corydon, He loved, but could not hope for Love again. For tho Pastoral does
not admit any violent passions, such as proceed from the greatest extremity,
and usually accompany despair; yet because Despairing Love is not attended with
those frightful and horrible consequences, but looks more like grief to be
pitied, and a pleasing madness, than rage and fury, Eclogue is so far from
refusing, that it rather loves, and passionately requires them. Therefore an
unfortunate Shepherd may be brought in, complaining of his succesless Love to
the Moon, Stars, or Rocks, or to the Woods, and purling Streams, mourning the
unsupportable anger, the frowns and coyness of his proud Phyllis; singing at
his Nymphs door, (which Plutarch reckons among the signs of Passion) or doing
any of those fooleries, which are familiar to Lovers. Yet the Passion must not
rise too high, as Polyphemus's, Galateas's mad Lover, of whom Theocritus
divinely thus, as almost of every thing else: His was no common flame, nor
could he move
In the old Arts, and beaten paths of Love,
No Flowers nor Fruits sent to oblige the Fair,
His was all Rage, and Madness:
For all violent Perturbations are to be diligently avoided by Bucolicks, whose
nature it is to be soft, and easy: For in small matters, and such must all the
strifes and contentions of Shepherds be, to make a great deal of ado, is as
unseemly, as to put Hercules's Vizard and Buskins on an Infant, as Quintilian
has excellently observed. For since Eclogue is but weak, it seems not capable
of those Commotions which belong to the Theater, and Pulpit; they must be soft,
and gentle, and all its Passion must seem to flow only, and not break out: as
in Virgil's Gallus, Ah, far from home and me You wander over
The Alpine snows, the farthest Western shore,
And frozen Rhine. When are we like to meet?
Ah gently, gently, lest thy tender feet
Sharp Ice may wound.


To these he may sometimes join some short Interrogations made to inanimate
Beings, for those spread a strange life and vigor through the whole Composure.
Thus in Daphnis, Did not You Streams, and Hazels, hear the Nymphs? Or give the
very Trees, and Fountains sense, as in Tityrus, Thee (Tityrus) the Pines, and
every Vale,
The Fountains, Hills, and every Shrub did call:
for by this the Concernment is expressed; and of the like nature is that of
Thyrsis, in Virgil's Melibaeus, When Phyllis eomes, my wood will all be green.

And this sort of Expressions is frequent in Theocritus, and Virgil, and in
these the delicacy of Pastoral is principally contained, as one of the old
Interpreters of Theocritus has observed on this line, in the eighth Idyllium,
Ye Vales, and Streams, a race Divine: But let them be so, and so seldom used,
that nothing appear vehement, and bold, for Boldness and Vehemence destroy the
sweetness which peculiarly commends Bucolicks, and in those Composures a
constant care to be soft and easy should be chief: For Pastoral bears some
resemblance to Terence, of whom Tully, in that Poem which he writes to Libo,
gives this Character, His words are soft, and each expression sweet. In mixing
Passion in Pastorals, that rule of Longinus, in his golden Treatise (...), must
be observed, Never use it, but when the matter requires it, and then too very
sparingly.

Concerning the Numbers, in which Pastoral should be written, this is my
opinion; the Heroic Measure, but not so strong and sounding as in Epicks, is
to be chosen. Virgil and Theocritus have given us examples; for tho Theocritus
has in one Idyllium mixed other Numbers, yet that can be of no force against
all the rest; and Virgil uses no Numbers but Heroic, from whence it may be
inferred, that those are the fittest.

Pastoral may sometimes admit plain, but not long Narrations, such as Socrates
in Plato requires in a Poet; for he chiefly approves those who use a plain
Narration, and commends that above all other which is short, and fitly
expresses the nature of the Thing. Some are of opinion that Bucolicks cannot
endure Narrations, especially if they are very long, and imagine there are none
in Virgil: but they have not been nice enough in their observations, for there
are some, as that in Silenus: Young Chromis and Mnasylus chanct to stray,
Where (sleeping in a Cave) Silenus lay,
Whose constant Cups fly fuming to his brain,
And always boil in each extended vein:
His trusty Flaggon, full of potent Juice,
Was hanging by, worn out with Age, and Use, etc.


But because Narrations are so seldom to be found in Theocritus, and Virgil, I
think they ought not to be often used; yet if the matter will bear it, I
believe such as Socrates would have, may very fitly be made use of.

The Composure will be more suitable to the Genius of a Shepherd, if now and
then there are some short turns and digressions from the purpose: Such is that
concerning Pasiphae in Silenus, although it is almost too long; but we may give
Viogil a little leave, who takes so little liberty himself.

Concerning Descriptions I cannot tell what to lay do^n, for in this matter our
Guides, Virgil, and Theocritus* do not very well agree. For he in his first
Idyllium makes such a long immoderate description of his Cup, that Critics
find fault with him, but no such description appears in all Virgil; for how
sparing is he in his description of Melibaeus's Be^chen Pot, the work of Divine
Alcimedon? He does it in five verses, Theocritus runs out into thirty, which
certainly is an argument of a wit that is very much at leisure, and unable to
moderate his force. That shortness which Virgil has prudently made choice of,
is in my opinion much better; for a Shepherd, who is naturally incurious, and
unobserving, cannot think that it is his duty to be exact in particulars, and
describe every thing with an accurate niceness: yet Roncardus has done it, a
man of most correct judgment, and, in imitation of Theocritus, has,
considering the then poverty of our language, admirably and largely described
his Cup; and Marinus in his Idylliums has followed the same example. He never
keeps within compass in his Descriptions, for which he is deservedly blamed;
let those who would be thought accurate, and men of judgment, follow Virgil's
prudent moderation. Nor can the Others gain any advantage from M^schus's
Europa, in which the description of the Basket is very long, for that Idyllium
is not Pastoral: yet I confess, that some descriptions of such trivial things,
if not minutely accurate, may, if seldom used, be decently allowed a place in
the discourses of Shepherds.

But tho you must be sparing in your Descriptions, yet your Comparisons must be
frequent, and the more often you use them, the better and more graceful will be
the Composure; especially if taken from such things, as the Shepherds must be
familiarly acquainted with: They are frequent in Theocritus, but so proper to
the Country, that none but a Shepherd dare use them. Thus Menalcas in the
eighth Idyllium: Rough Storms to Trees, to Birds the treacherous Snare,
Are frightful Evils; Springes to the Hare,
Soft Virgins Love to Man, etc.
And Damaetas in Virgil's Palaemon, Woolves Sheep destroy, Winds Trees when
newly blown,
Storms Corn, and me my Amaryllis frown.
And that in the eighth Eclogue, As Clay grows hard, Wax soft in the same fire,
So Daphnis does in one extreme desire.
And such Comparisons are very frequent in him, and very suitable to the Genius
of a Shepherd: as likewise often repetitions, and doublings of some words:
which, if they are luckily placed, have an unexpressible quaintness, and make
the Numbers extreme sweet, and the turns ravishing and delightful. An instance
of this we have in Virgil's Meliboeus, Phyllis the Hazel loves; whilst Phyllis
loves that Tree,
Myrtles than Hazels of less fame shall be.


As for the Manners of your Shepherds, they must be such as theirs who lived in
the Islands of the Happy or Golden Age: They must be candid, simple, and
ingenuous; lovers of Goodness, and Justice, affable, and kind; strangers to all
fraud, contrivance, and deceit; in their Love modest, and chaste, not one
suspicious word, no loose expression to be allowed: and in this part Theocritus
is faulty, Virgil never; and this difference perhaps is to be ascribed to their
Ages, the times in which the latter lived being more polite, civil, and
gentile. And therefore those who make wanton Love-stories the subject of
Pastorals, are in my opinion very unadvised; for all sort of lewdness or
debauchery are directly contrary to the Innocence of the golden Age. There is
another thing in which Theocritus is faulty, and that is making his Shepherds
too sharp, and abusive to one another; Comatas and Lacon are ready to fight,
and the railing between those two is as bitter as Billingsgate: Now certainly
such Raillery cannot be suitable to those sedate times of the Happy Age.

As for Sentences, if weighty, and Philosophical, common Sense tells us they
are not fit for a Shepherd's mouth. Here Theocritus cannot be altogether
excused, but Virgil deserves no reprehension But Proverbs justly challenge
admission into Pastorals, nothing being more common in the mouths of Countrymen
than old Sayings.

THEOCRITUS
Idyllium I. Called Thyrsis, or (...).
A Goatherd persuades the Shepherd Thrysis to bewail Daphnis who died for Love,
and gives him a large Cup and Goat for a reward. The Scene Sicily, about the
River Himera.

Thyrsis. GOatherd, that Pine-tree's boughs by yonder spring
In pleasing murmurs mix, and sweetly sing:
And Thou do sweetly pipe, dear charming Swain,
And well deserve the next reward to Pan:
If He must have a Kid, a Goat's Thy due,
If He a Goat, a Kid belongs to You:
And that is no mean reward, for Kids are good,
And till they are milkt the flesh is dainty food.

Goatherd. And, Sheapherd, sweeter Notes thy Pipe do fill
Than murmuring springs that roll from yonder hill.
When Muses claim a Sheep, a Lamb's thy due;
When they a Lamb, thou shall receive a Ewe.

Thyrsis. And will You, by the Nymphs, grant one desire,
Will you to neighboring shady banks retire,
And sit and pipe? come show thy wondrous skill,
I Will thank thee for it, and feed thy Goats the while.

Goatherd. I dare not, faith I dare not pipe at Noon,
Afraid of Pan, for when his Hunting's done,
And He lies down to sleep by purling streams,
He Is very touchy if we break his dreams:
But Thyrsis (for you know fair Daphnis pains,
And singst the best of all the tuneful Swains)
Let Us go and sit beneath you Myrtle boughs,
Where stands Priapus, and the Nymphs repose,
Where thy Hut's built and many an Acorn grows,
And there if thou will pipe as sweet a Lay
As when you strove with The name of a Sheapherd.
Crome and wan the day,
I Will give Thee my best Goat, a lovely white;
She suckles Two, yet fills Three Pails at night;
Besides a Cup with sweetest Wax over laid,
A fine Two-handled Pot, and newly made:
Still of the Tool it smells, it neatly shines,
And round the brim a creeping Ivy twines
With Crocus mixed; where Kids do seem to bronze,
The Berryes crop, and wanton in the boughs:
Within a Woman sits, a work divine,
Through envious vails her daz^ing Beauty's shine,
And all around neat Woers offer Love,
They strive, they quarrel, but they cannot move:
Now smiling here, now there she casts her Eyes,
And now to These, now Those her mind applies:
Whilst They, their Eyes swollen big with watchful pain,
Still Love, still beg, but all, poor hearts, in vain.
Near These a Fisher on white Rocks is set,
He seems to gather up to cast his Net:
He stands as laboring, and his Limbs appear
All stretched, and in his face mix hope and fear:
The Nerves in's Neck are swollen, look firm and strong,
All-tho He Is old, and fit for one that is Young:
Next him ripe Grapes in blushing Clusters twine,
And a fair Boy sits by to keep the Vine:
On either side a Fox; one widely gapes,
He eyes the Vines, and spoils the ripning Grapes:
The other minds the Skrip, resolved to seize
And rob the Fondling of his Bread and Cheese;
Whilst He sets idly busy, neatly ties
Soft tender twigs, and frames a Net for Flies;
Pleased with his vain designs, a careless Boy,
And more than Grapes or Skrip he minds the Toy.
Round all a Creeping Woodbine does aspire,
A Some take (...), as relating to the Country, and would not have Calydon in
the next line to be a proper Name.
curious sight, i am sure you must admire:
'Twas Calydons, but when he crossed the Seas
I bought it for a Goat, and Rammel Cheese:
It never touched my Lips, unsoild, and new,
And this I freely will present to you,
Heinsius reads (...), right no doubt, but it matters little.
If you will sing how in the shady Grove
Young Daphnis pined, and how He died for Love.
I am in Earnest, I will love Thee long,
And surely mind the favor of thy song.

Thyrsis. Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song:
It Is Thyrsis song, Thyrsis from Aetna came,
Some read, (...) some (...).
Sweet is his voice, and sounding as his fame:
Where were you Nymphs? Where did the Nymphs reside,
Where were you then when Daphnis pined and died?
On Pindus Top, or Tempe's open plain?
Where careless Nymphs forgetful of the Swain?
For not one Nymph by swift Asopus stood,
Nor Aetnas Cliff, nor Acis sacred flood.
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue.
Begin, sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song:
For him the Woolves, the Pards, and Tigers moan'd,
For Him with frightful grief the Lions groaned:
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song.
A thousand Heifers, Bulls, and Cows, and Steers
Lay round his feet, and melted into Tears:
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song.
First Hermes came, and with a gentle touch
He raised, and and asked him whom he loved so much?
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song.
The Plowmen, Heardsmen, and the Sheapherds came,
And asked what ill? and what had raised the flame?
Priapus came from neighboring shades, and said,
Poor Daphnis, why do pine? why hang thy head?
I follow Heinsius his Comment, which seems to be the best, and most agreeable
to the Poets design.
Mean while they Nymph does over the fields complain,
She calls the Woods, and chides the perjured Swain;
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural song.
Ah Daphnis loose and wanton in thy Love!
A Heardsman thought, thou do a Goatherd prove!
A Goatherd when he sees the Kids at rut
Sits down, and grieves that He Is not born a Goat;
Thus when you see the Virgins dance, you grieve
Because refused, and now disdain to live:
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song.
All this young Daphnis heard, but mute he sat,
Indulged his grief, and hastened to his Fate:
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song.
Then Venus came, a Smile her face possessed,
A faint half smile; fierce anger filled her breast:
And said, well Daphnis you could fight with Love,
With what success the haughty Sheapherd strove!
You scorned his Bow, and you his Darts Disgraced;
But Daphnis was not Love too strong at last?
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song.
And thus the Youth replied, disdainful foe,
Ah cruel Venus, cursed by all below?
The Sun has told, I fall, but still shall prove
Midst shades below a deadly plague to Love:
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the Rural Song:
Go, go to Ida, there, as story goes,
Are Scenes of Pleasure, there Anchises does: --
Go Venus, there are shades, and Cypress bowers,
And laboring Bees buz over the riseing flowers:
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song:
There lives Adonis, there the wondrous fair,
There feeds his Sheep, shoots Beasts, and hunts the Hare: This reading seems
best, tho against the opinion of several of the Critics.

Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song:
Go now stout Diomed, go soon pursue,
Go nose him now, and boast, my Arts o'rethrew
Young Daphnis, fight, for I Am a match for you:
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song:
Ye Woolves, ye Lions, and ye Bores adieu,
For Daphnis walks no more in Woods with you;
Adieu fair Arethuse, fair streams that swell
Through Thymbrian plains, ye silver streams farewell:
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song:
That Daphnis I that here my Oxen fed,
That here my Bulls and Cows to water led:
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song:
Pan, Pan, where e're you keep your Sylvan court
Whether on Lyce's tops the Satyrs sport,
Or wanton over the high Menalian hill;
We beg Thee visit Sicily's fair Isle,
Leave Helick's Cliff, from Licon's Tomb remove,
A Tomb to be admired by Gods above,
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song:
Come mighty King, come Pan, and take my Pipe
Well joined with Wax, and sitted to my Lip,
For now it is useless grown, Love stops my Breath,
I cannot Pipe, but must be mute in death:
Pan raise my voice, Pan move my learned tongue,
Begin sweet Muse, begin the rural song:
On every Shrub and Thorn let Lillies smile,
Let Privet berries stain the Daffadil;
Let all things change, the Pine tree's lofty head
Let mellow Pears adorn, since Daphni's dead,
Let Deer pursue the Dogs, on ever^ bush
Let Schreech-Owls sit, and chatter with the Thrush:
Pan raise my voice no more, Pan stop my tongue,
End Muses, end, end Muse, the rural song:
This said He died, fair Venus rubbed the Swain,
And idly strove to bring him back again;
For cruel Fate had broken every thread
And over the Stygian Lake young Daphni fled:
The cruel waves enclosed the lovely Boy
The Nymphs delight, and Muses chiefest joy:
Pan raise my voice no more, Pan stop my tongue,
End Muses, end, end Muse the rural song
Give me the Cup the promised Goat produce,
That I may milk, and offer to my Muse;
Hail, Muses, hail, all hail ye sacred Nine,
I Will still improve, and make my Song divine.

Goat-heard, Dear Thyrsis! O! may Honey drops distill,
And Honey Combs, thy mouth, dear Sheaperd, fill!
It fits thy sweetness, youth, for Thyrsis sings
More sweet than Insects bred in flowery springs:
Here take the Cup, view it, how rare the smell!
As sweet as washed in the Springs fragrant well:
Come The name of the Goat.
Browning, milk her; Kids, forbear to skip,
The Goat is wanton, Kids, and he may leap.

Idyllium II. Or the Enchantment.
Samoetha being forsaken by Delphis resolves to try the force of Charms to
recover his affection; applies herself to the Moon as a powerful Goddess in
both those matters, and after she has sent away her maid, tells the story of
her misfortune.

To GEORGE PIT Jun. Esquire.
MAid, where is my Laurel? Oh my rageing Soul!
Maid, where is the Potion? fill the Basin full,
And crown the narrow brim with Purple wool:
That I might charm my false, my perjured Swain,
And force him back into my arms again:
For Cruel he these Twelve long days has fled,
And knows not whether I Am alive or dead:
He has not broke my Doors these Twelve long days,
Ah me! perhaps his varying Love decays,
Or else he dotes upon another face.
I Will run to morrow to the Fencing house,
And ask him what he means to use me thus:
But now I Will charm him, Moon, shine brignt and clear,
To thee I will direct my secret prayer;
To Thee, and Hecate, whom Dogs do dread
When stained with gore, she stalks amidst the dead:
Hail frightful Hecate, assist me still
Make mine as great as famed Medea's skill:
A Bird sacred to Venus much used in Love Charms
Jynx restore my false, my perjured Swain
And force him back into my Arms again.
First burn the Flowr, then strew the (...)
other on,
Strew it. How? where is your sense and duty gone?
Base Thestylis! and am I so forlorn,
And grown so low that I Am become your scorn!
But strew the (...) not (...)
Salt, and say in angry tones
I scatter Delphids, perjured Delphids bones.
Jynx restore my false, my perjured Swain
And force him back into my Arms again.
First Delphid injured me, he raised my flame,
And now I burn this Bough in Delphids name:
As this does blaze, and break away in fume,
How soon it takes! let Delphids Flesh consume.
Jynx restore my false, my perjured Swain,
And force him back into my Arms again.
As this devoted Wax melts ore the Fire
Let Mindian Delphy melt in warm desire,
And, Venus, as I whirl this brazen bowl,
Before my doors let perjured Delphid roll:
Jynx restore my false, my perjured Swain,
And force him back into my Arms again.
Now now I strew the Flowr, Moon you can bow
Even Rhadamanth, and all that is fierce below,
Hark Thestilis our Dogs begin to howl,
The Goddess comes, go beat the brazen bowl.
Jynx restore my false, m^ perjured Swain,
And force him back into my Arms again.
The Sea grows smooth, and ease becalms my Wind,
But griefs still rage, and toss my troubled mind:
I burn for Him, for Him whose Arts betrayed
And wrought my shame, for I Am no more a maid.
Jynx restore my false, my perjured Swain,
And force him back into my arms again.
Thrice, thrice I pour, and thrice repeat my charms,
What ever Boy or Maid now fills his arms,
Let dark oblivion spread over Delphids mind,
As dark as that, that once did The story ^f Theseus and Ariadne is known.
Theseus blind
When he at Naxos left his Love behind.
Hippomanes a Plant Arcadia bears,
This makes Steeds mad, and this excites the Mares,
And Oh that I could see my Delphid come
From the Oily Feneing House so raveing home.
Jynx restore my false, my perjured Swain,
And force him back into my Arms again.
This piece from dear false Delphids garment torn
I tear again, and am resolved to burn,
Ah cruel Love! ah most relentless God,
Why like a Leech still eager on his food,
Do wound my heart, and suck out all my blood?
Jynx restore my false, my perjured Swain,
And force him back into my A^ms again.
A Lizzard squeezed shall make a powerful bowl
To morrow, strong to tame his stubborn Soul:
Now take these Poisons, I Will procure thee more,
And strew them at the Threshold of his door,
That door where violent Love has fixed my mind,
Tho he regards not; Cruel and Unkind!
Strew them, and spitting say in angry tones,
I scatter Delphids, perjured Delphids bones.
Jynx restore my false, my perjured Swain,
And force him back into my arms again.
Now I Am alone shall I lament my state?
But where shall I begin? what wrought my Fate?
Anaxo Eubul's daughter neatly dressed
Begd me to go and see Diana's feast,
For fame had to^d, Wild beasts must there be shown
In solemn pomp, a Lioness was one.
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise thy flame,
And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came.
With Hers my Nurse, did all her vows unite,
And bad me go, for 'twould be worth my ^ight,
So forced, and finely dressed, in Pomp and State
I went, attended by an evil Fate.
Tell Sacred Moon what first did raise my flame
And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came.
Near Lyco's House break through the yielding throng,
I saw my Delphis, vigorous, stout, and young,
A Golden Down spread o re his youthful Chin,
His breast, bright Moon, was brighter far than thine:
For spread with glorious Oil he lately came
From noble Fenceing, and from winning Fame:
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame
And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came.
Oh when I saw, how did the sight surprise!
My Soul took Fire, and sparkeld through my eyes,
My Color changed, regardless of the show
I hasted home, but came I know not how;
A burning feavour seized my thoughtful head,
And Twelve long days and nights I kept my bed,
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame,
And whence my Pain, and whenc^ my Passion came
My Rosy Color d'yd into a Pale,
My Eyes grew dim, my hair began to fall,
Mere Skin and Bones, I lived, I breathed and prayed,
And sought to every Cunning man for aid:
All charms were tried, and various Figures cast,
But ah no help, and time did swiftly wast:
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame,
And whence my Pain, and whence my passion came.
At last I told my Maid the naked truth,
Go Thestilis, have pity on my youth;
Go find some cure to ease my rageing smart;
Young Delphid is the Tyrant of my Heart:
Go to the Fenceing House, there is his delight,
For there he walks, and there he loves to sit.
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame,
And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came.
And if alone, give him a gentle Nod,
And softly tell him that Samaetha would
(Speak, speak, tho modest fear does strike thee dumb)
Enjoy him here, and beg him he would come.
She went, she found, and told him what I said,
He Gladly heard, and eagerly obeyed.
But when he came, how great was the surprise
Chills shook my Soul, and I grew cold as Ice:
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame,
And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came.
Cold sweat slow'd down my Cheeks like driving rain,
And when I strove to speak, I strove in vain;
No noise would come, not such as lull^d in rest
Young Infants murmur over their mothers breast:
No sign of Life did through my Limbs appear,
But I grew stiff, stiff as this Gold I wear:
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame,
And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came.
Then cruel he sat down, he pressed my bed,
His eyes were fixed, and as he sat he said,
Samoetha you do me as far surpass,
As I Philistus when we ran the race;
Too quick for me in this your kind intent,
You did my have, tho not my wish prevent.
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame,
And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came.
For I had come at night, by Love it is true,
Unsent for I had come to wait on you:
With Apples in my Lap, with This was the Custom to wait on their beloved with
these Love Toys, as Apples, and Garlands to perform their Ceremony called
(...), His was to be of Poplar as befiting ^ Wrestler, being a Tree sacred to
Hercules.
Poplar crowned
With Ivy twined, and Ribbonds neatly bound:
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame,
And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came.
Where if admitted to had been kindly done
For I am thought the beauty of the Town;
And tho perhaps I wished for greater bliss
I would have been contented with a kiss;
But if denied, or flamed with dull delay
Straight fire and force had come, and broke a way:
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame,
And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came.
But now to Venus my first thanks are due,
The next Samoetha must be paid to you,
To you Samoetha, you, whose gentle hand
From raging fires secured the flaming brand,
And saved poor half-burnt Me, for Love does raise
Fires fierce as those that in hot Aetna blaze;
Tell sacred Moon what first did raise my flame,
And whence my Pain, and whence my Passion came.
Young tender Maids to unknown Madness drives,
And from warm Husbands Arms it forces Wives:
Thus He, and heedless I believed too soon,
He pressed My hand in His, and laid me down
On the soft bed, when straight locked Arm in Arm
In strickt embraces both grew gently warm;
Our breath was hot and short, we panting lay,
We looked, we murmured, and we died away:
Our Cheeks did glow, and fainting virtue strove,
At last it yielded to the force of Love:
But what need all this talk? bright sacred Moon,
Both were well pleased, and some strange thing was done:
And ever since we loved, and lived at ease,
No sullen Minutes broke our Happiness;
Till ^oon this morning e're the Sun could rise,
And drive his Chariot through the yielding Skies
To fetch the Rosy Morn from waves below,
I heard the fatal news, and knew my woe:
My Maids own Mother, she that lives hard by
An Honest Woman, and she scorns to ly;
She came and asked me, is your Delphid kind?
And have you firm posession of his Mind?
For I am sure, but whether Maid or Boy
I cannot tell, he courts another joy:
For he drinks Healths, and when those Healths are past,
He must be gone, and goes away in have:
Besides with Garlands all his Rooms are dressed,
And he prepares, as for a Marriage Feast;
This as as she walked last night she chanced to view,
And told it me, and oh, I fear it is true!
For He was wont to come twice, thrice a day,
He saw me still as he returned from play;
But now since he was here twelve nights are past,
Am I forgotten? am I left at last?
Whilst perjured he for other Beauty burns,
My Love I Am sure deserved more kind returns,
But now I Will Charm, but if he scorns me still
I Will force him down to Hell, by Fate, I will:
Such powerful drugs a Witch did once impart
She taught me such strange Charms, such force of Art:
But now farewell bright Moon, turn lovely Moon
To Waves below, and drive thy Chariot down,
Go lovely Moon, and wake the sleepy Morn:
I Will bear my trouble still, as I have born;
Farewell, and you attending Stars that wheel
Round Nights black Axle-tree, bright Stars, farewell.
Idyllium III. The Goatherd.
He repines at the coyness of his Mistress and ends in despair.

I go to Phyllis, and on yonder Rock
My Goats are fed, and Tityrus keeps my flock;
Dear Tityrus watch, and see the Goats be fed,
To morning Pastures, Evening Waters led,
But 'ware the Lybian Ridgling's butting head:
Ah lovely Phyllis why so wondrous coy!
Why will not you take me to the promised joy?
Why will not you meet me now in yonder Grove
Lean on my Breast, and Kiss, and call me Love?
Do hate me, Phyllis? does my Nose when near
Seem hookt, too long my Beard, and rough my hair?
Am I deformed? displeasing to thy Eye!
Grown ugly now! I see that I must dye:
Ten Apples I have sent, you showed the Tree,
Ten more to morrow; all I pluck for Thee;
Could I enjoy what e're my wish can crave,
I Would turn that Be that flies into thy Cave,
There softly through thy shady Garland creep,
And steal a Kiss when you are fast asleep;
I know what Love is now, a cruel God,
A Tygress bore, and nursed him in a Wood;
A cruel God, he shoots through every vein,
And fires my bones, have pity on my pain:
Dear, black eyed sweet, all stone, ah lovely face,
Be kind again, and grant one kind embrace;
Do, clasp thy humble Swain, and grant one Kiss,
Even empty Kisses have a secret bliss.
I rave, and I shall tear the Crowns I made,
Of Fragrant Parsley twined, to grace your head;
Ah me! unhappy me! what pains I bear?
Ah me! undone! yet you refuse to hear:
My Jerkin's off, I Will leap into the flood
From you high Rock, where Olpis often stood
To snare his Trouts; and tho I do not drown
'Twill please Thee Phyllis, sure, to hear 'twas done:
All this I knew: when I designed to prove
Whether I should be happy in my Love,
I pressed the Long-live, but invain did press,
It gave no lucky sound of good success:
To Agrio too I made the same demand,
A cunning Woman she, I crossed her hand;
She turned the Sieve and Sheers, and told me true,
That I should love, but not be loved by you:
I have a pretty Goat, a lovely white,
She bears two Kids, yet fills three Pails at night,
This tawny Bess has begged, and begged in vain,
But now it is hers since you my gifts disdain:
My right Eye itches now, and shall I see
My Love? I Will sit and pipe by yonder tree,
And she may look on me, she may be won,
She may be kind, she is not perfect Stone:
When young Hippomanes sought the Maids embrace,
He took the Golden fruit, and ran the race.
But when she viewed, how strong was the surprise!
Her Soul took Fire, and sparkled through her Eyes,
How did her passions, how her fury move!
How soon she leapt into the deepest Love!
From Aetna's top to Pyle Melampus drove
His tender Flock, and met a noble Love:
Wise Alphisb's mother opened all her charms
To Bias Eyes, and wantoned in his Arms:
Adonis lived a Swain, and yet the Boy
Fired Venus breast, She proved so mad for joy
That ir her lap she warmed his dying Head,
Kisst his cold Lips, and would not think him dead:
Tho young Endymion fed ten Thousand Sheep,
I envy nothing but his lasting sleep:
I envy Jason's happy dreams, my Dear,
They tasted joys which no profane must hear,
Joys too divine for an unhallowed Ear:
Ah me my head! but who regards my pain!
l'le fall, despair, and never pipe again:
A prey to Woolvs, 'twill be a dainty feast,
And sweeter far than Honey to thy taste.
Idyllium IV.
Battus and Corydon in a pastoral way discourse of several things.

To His good friend Mr. E. Lyde of Horspath.
B. WHose Herds? Philonda's? tell whose Herds they are,


C. Aegon's, for Aegon gave them to my care,


B. Do'nt you play false, and sometimes milk a Cow,
By stealth?

C. No, my old Master eyes me so,
Gives the Calves suck, and watches what I do:

B. But where is Aegon? where is the Herdsman gone?


C. What ha'nt you heard? for sure the story's known,


B. Not I, I live out of the road of Fame:


C. Milo has him drawn to the Olympian game:


B. And what will He do there, rude artless Swain?


C. But yet his strength is famed over all the plain;
As big as Hercules, as stout and strong,

B. More known for brutal force, than famed for Song:


C. He nere played Cudgels but he broak a head,
Stout Castor's match I Am sure my mother said:
A score of For diet and exercise before he Wrestled.
Sheep he carried, and a Spade,

B. What will not Milo do, that can persuade
This Clown to leave his wealth, and court a shade?

C. His Cows here want him, and mourn over the plain:


B. Poor Beasts! and how unhappy in a Swain!


C. Poor beasts! they will not eat, but idly low;


B. Ah careless Herdsman! look on yonder Cow,
Poor Beast I pity her, how ghastly thin!
Her bones are creeping through the famisht skin:
See you may tell her Ribs, her entrails view:
What, like an Insect, does she feed on Dew?

C. No; and I hope to see her shortly prove,
She sometimes does in Latym's shady Grove
And sometimes over Asaru's pastures stray,
And there I feed her at a rack of Hay:

B. Look that red Bull is Iean, mere skin and bone,
May the Lampridoe, when they would atone
Great Juno's anger; meet with such a one;
Lean be his aged flesh, corrupt his blood,
For they deserv't, ah it is a cursed brood:

C. And yet I feed him, by the Springs He goes,
Or in Neoetha's plains, where plenty flows,
The Gilcup Cowslip, and the Dazy grows:

B. Ah wretched Aegon here thy Oxen dye
Whilst you pursue a foolish Victory:
Thy best new Pipe is spoiled, it is moldy grown,
Alas it must be spoiled now Thou art gone:

C. No fear of that, for when He went away
He gave it me, and, Battus, I can play:
I sing smooth Phyrrhus songs, I gain renown
To Croto, Zacynth is a pretty Town,
Lacinius rises proudly to the East,
There Aegon once eat eighty Cakes at least:
There did I see him whilst He bravely strove,
Draw down the Bull, and give him to his love,
To Amaryllis, all with joy were filled
The Women shouted, and the Herdsman smiled:

B. Ah lovely Amaryllis, you alone
Do still possess my mind, tho dead and gone;
Dear as my Goats you died, and left me here
Ah me how hard's my Fate, and how severe!

C. Cheer up, dear Battus, better days may come
To morrow, chance, may bring a milder doom:
The alive may hope, the dead are hopeless, lost;
Jove sometimes smiles, and sometimes frowns in frost:

B. I do cheer up, but drive your Heifers down
They spoil my Olives, Browning, Hist, begone:

C. Hah, Colly, to the bank: not stir by Jove?
If I come to ye, In faith, I Will make ye move:
See now she runs this way; a cursed Cow!
Had I my Paddle thou should feel me now:

B. Look here for God's sake, oh it pricks, it pricks!
I Have caught a thorn, oh me how deep it sticks!
Pray pull it out, do see it? look it is there;
Pox take the Cow, I Am sure 'twas long of her:

C. I have it out, 'twas this, come, all is well,


B. How small the wound, yet what vast Courage fell!


C. Never walk ore mountains, Swain, without your Shoe,
For there are thorns, and there sharp prickles grow:

B. But Swain, does thy old Master still pursue
His old Sweetheart, or does he court a new;

C. His old one still, poor wretch! in yonder grove
I traced, and found them in a Scene of Love:

B. Oh brave old lusty Goat! thy race may vye
With small shank't Pan's, or Satyr's Leachery!

Idyllium V.
The Goatherd Comatas, and Herdsman Laco contend in Singing, They lay a Wager,
and choose Morso Judge: The victory is determined on the Goatherd's side.

To Owen Salisbury Esquire.
C. FLY Goats fly Laco, fly, and safely feed;
He stole my skin last night, dear Goats take heed:

L. Lambs do'nt you fly the springs? Lambs don't you fear,
When He that lately stole my Pipe's so near?

C. Thy Pipe! what Pipe had Thou, thou slavish lout,
Could Thou and Corydon do ought but toot
On Oaten straws, to please the foolish rout?

L. The Pipe that Lycon gave, free haughty fool;
But pray what skin was that that Laco stole?
What skin Comatas? where could thou have one?
Thy master wants a skin to sleep upon:

C. That spotted skin which, when He killed a Goat
To the Nymphs, Dick gave; which you, you envious Sot,
Then grieved to see; and now by knavish theft
Have robbed me of, 'twas all that I had left:

L. By Pan not Laco, not Calaithis Son
Did steal thy Pipe, or know by whom 'twas done;
If this be'nt true, may I grow frantic, leap
From yonder Rocks, and sink into the Deep:

C. And by the Fountain Nymphs, (those Nymphs I find
My constant friends, still generous and kind)
Comatas did not steal thy Pipe, believe
That this is true, and I thy fault forgive:

L. If I believe Thee may I bear the pains
That Daphnis bore, but since you boast your strains,
Come stake a Goat, I Will pipe when e're you will,
Till you grow weary, and confess my skill:

C. A Sow, Minerva: I Am content to lay
A Kid, you stake a Lamb, and then let us play:

L. And how is that equal? oh you crafty fool,
Pray who Goats hair did ever shoer for Wool?

C. He that is as sure as you are to excel,
(Tho Wasps with Grasshoppers may strive as well)
But since you think a Kid no equal stake,
Look there is a full-grown Goat, you shall not draw back:

L. Soft, soft, good Sir; and let us hence remove,
There Is better singing in that shady Grove;
For there cold water flows, there Herbs do spring,
And there are grassy beds, and locusts sing:

C. I Am not in have, but yet I Am vexed to see,
That Thou should dare at last to strive with me;
With me who when a Boy did teach thee strains,
Are these the kind returns for all my pains?
But breed a Woolf, or an ungrateful Bear,
And He Will devour Thee for thy former care:

L. Pray when did I, you envious railing Sot,
E're learn, or hear from you one graceful Note?
But pray come hither, here are beds of grass
And here we will sing, it is a convenient place:

C. I Will not go thither, here are Cypress bowers,
Here laboring Bees buz over the riseing flowers;
Here two cold streams, and here a fountain flows,
And prattling Birds do murmur through the boughs:
Thy shade's not half so good, here Pines do grow,
Rear lofty heads, and scatter Nuts below:

L. No rather go with me, and every step
Shall tread on Lamb skins Wool more soft than Sleep;
In thine are Goat skins spread of ghastly hue,
They smell as rank, nay almost worse than you:
One bowl of Milk I to the Nymphs will crown,
And one of Oil, if that will draw Thee on:

C. No, go with me, for mine are fairer bowers;
There Thou shall tread upon the sweetest flowers:
Besides over all I Will spread a lovely Skin,
It Is ten times softer, and as sweet as thine:
Eight Bowls of Milk to Pan I Will freely Crown,
Of Honey eight, if that will draw Thee on:

L. Come then I Will go, the doubt at last is cleared
Your skins, your shades shall be for once preferred;
But who shall judge, and who shall hear us play?
I wish the Herdsman Licop came this way:

C. I don't care much for him, but here is as good
Morson the Keeper of our Master's Wood,
He makes your Faggots, and if you will consent
We Will call him, He shall be our Judge,

L. content:

C. Then call him:

L. Friend, come here, we now contest:
Which tunes the Rural Pipe, which Sings the best,
Whose Art is greatest must be judged by Thee,
Judge right, and neither favor him, nor me:

C. No, Morson, let desert thy judgment guide,
Be fair to both, and lean to neither side;
This flock is Thurius flock, and these forsooth
Eumara's Goats; that you may know us both:

L. Did any ask to whom These flocks belong,
To me, or Thurius? oh Thou have a Tongue!

C. What ere I say, I Am sure, is naught but Truth,
I scorn to boast; But you have a railing mouth:

L. Sing, sing, but let thy friend return again,
Alive; Comatas! Oh how sweet a Swain!

C. Me more than Daphnis all the Muses love,
Two Kids I lately offered in a Grove:

L. And me Apollo loves, a wanton Steer
I feed to offer, for his feast is near:

C. I milk two Goats; A maid in yonder Plain:
Looked on, and sighed, do milk thy self, poor Swain!

L. Ha, Laco, hah, full twenty fats can fill
With Cheese, and has a lovely youth at will:

C. The fair Calistris, as my Goats I drove,
With Apples pelts me, and still murmurs Love:

L. And me smooth Cratid, when He meets me, fires;
I burn, I rage, and am all wild desires:

C. Who with the Rose, whose flower the bush adorns,
Compares the meaner beauties of the Thorns?

L. And who will Sloes with Damzen Plums compare?
For those are black, and these are lovely fair:

C. I Will give my Dear a Dove, in yonder woods
I Will climb, and take her down, for there she broods:

L. A fleece to make a Coat, when first I sheer
Black Rams, I will present unto my Dear:

C. Goats from the Olives, come and feed below,
By this declineing bank; there Myrtles grow:

L. Ho, Sharp-horn, Browning, leave those hurtful weeds'
And come and graze this way, where Colly feeds:

C. I have a Cypress Pail, and Cup; it is new,
Well wrought, and this, my Love, I keep for you:

L. I have a sturdy Spock, it Woolvs will seize,
With this my Boy may hunt what Beasts He please:

C. You Locusts, you, that over my fences throng,
Hurt not my Vines too much, for they are young:

L. See Grasshoppers, see how I nearly touch
The Goatherd, Reapers you provoke as much:

C. I hate the brush tail'd Fox, He comes at night,
Eats Myco's Vines; and then prepares for flight:

L. I hate the Beetles, for they always prey
On my Philonda's Figgs; then whisk away:

C. And do'nt you mind, when I -- you know the trick --,
You wantoned, la^ght, and clung to yonder stick:

L. Not that: but when your Master used to bind
And lash you there, I know; for that I mind:

C. He Is angry, Morson: art Thou frantic Swain?
Go gather Scilla, that will purge thy brain:

L. Morson, I nettle him, I vex him more,
Swain thou art Mad, go gather Helebore:

C. With milk Himera, and let Crathis slow
With purple Wine; let Figgs on Brambles grow:

L. Let Sybaris roll Honey, every Urn
My Servant dips with flowing Combs return:

C. My Goats eat Thyme, on Figgs they freely brouze,
They walk on Flaggs, and ly on tender Boughs:

L. My Sheep eat Parsley, through the fields they stray,
They crop sweet flowers, and Dazies all the day:

C. I love not Alcipp; (She I hoped would prove
More kind) when I presented Her a Dove,
She did not clasp, and kiss, and call me Love;

L. I love Eumedes much, I gave my Pipe,
How sweet a kiss he gave; ah charming Lip!

C. Thou art contentious, Lacon, end thy strains;
Pyes should not strive with Thrushes, Owls with Swans:

Morson. End, Shepherd, end thy strains, and dye for shame,
For Morson says Comatas wins the Lamb:
Go offer to the Muse, and send a Piece
To Morson, for He claims it as his fees:

Comatas. I will by Pan, my Goats all leap for joy:
And I Will frisk too, I Will leap into the Sky:
I Will toot at Lacon, I have won the Lamb,
Go foolish Shepherd, pine, and dye for shame*
Frisk, Goats, and leap; in Sybaris purling spring
I Will wash you all, and all the while I Will sing:
Push not the Kids, you Goat, till I have done
The Sacrifice, if you dare push but one,
Thou shall -- how now? well, thou shallt smart for this,
Or may Comatas, He that wan the prize,
Forget his Pipe, and loose his flock, be poor;
And basely beg his bread at Laco's door.

Idyllium VI.
Damaetas and Daphnis, meeting at noon, sing; Daphnis applies his Song to
Polyphemus, who was in Love with Galataea, and Damaetas in his Person answers.

To Thomas Wyndham of Lincolns Inn, Esquire.
DAmaetas and the Herdsman Daphnis drove
Their flocks to feed, and took one shady grove;
The one was bearded, of a charming grace,
The other young; Down clothed his lovely face;
They sat and wantoned by a purling spring
In The Middays heat; and thus began to sing;
The lowing Herds lay round, and quenched their thirst;
First: Daphnis sang, for He had challenged first:
Daphnis. Fair Galataea from the smiling deep
With Apples, Polyphemus, pelts thy Sheep;
(See from the shore they all with have remove)
And says a Goatherd's an unskilful Love:
But you poor wretch, ah wretch! never view the Maid,
But sit, and pipe; and call to floods for aid:
See there again, see how she pelts thy Spock,
The faithful Dog that keeps thy wandering flock;
Hah, how he barks! and in a wild amaze
Looks over the flood! and whilst by shores he strays
His shadow in the quiet water plays:
Ah! call him back, lest when the Maid appears
He rushes on, and her fair limbs he tears:
But there she wantons, she, the charming fair,
As Down of thistles in the Summer Air;
And driven still by an unlucky fate
Flies those that love, and follows those that hate:
Her ways are foolish, and in vain she trys;
But, Polyphem, mean things do often surprise,
For Love is Magic, and deceives the Eyes:

Damaetas. And next Damaetas sang; I chanced to look,
By Pan I did, whilst she did pelt my flock;
She could not escape this Eye, this single one
By which I see, and will, till Life is gone;
Tho Tellemus foretells strange ills to come,
Oh let him take, and keep his ills at home,
And for his Children treasure up the Doom!
But straightways I, to raise her flame the more,
Seem not to see her trace the yielding shore;
But can pretend I court another Miss;
Then how she frets, Good God! and how she dys!
Oh with what eager have she leaves the waves!
My Folds she searches, and looks over my Caves:
Besides, my Dog, He is at my command,
Shall bark at her and gently bite her hand:
For whilst she was my Love, the only she,
He fawned, and laid his head upon her knee:
This if I practice long, she will strive to move,
And send a Message to declare her Love:
But I will shut my door, and scorn to heed,
Unless she swears that she will grant her bed;
For I Am not ugly, for last night I stood
And viewed my Figure in a quiet stood;
Let men say what they will, my face is fair,
My Beard is fine, I Am sure; and neat my hair,
And this one Eye, in my Opinion, rare:
I have a set of Teeth, a finer white
No Parian Marble boasts, a lovely sight:
But lest she charm me, I have murmured thrice,
Spit thrice for old Cotytto taught me this;
She that of late in rich Hyppocoon's room
Sat mids't the Reapers, and sang Harvest home:
Thus sang Damaetas, and with eager joy
Young Daphnis kisst, and claps't the lovely Boy:
I gave them gifts that suited with their youth,
A Pipe, and Flute; and so I pleased them both:
The jocund Heifers wantoned over the fields
Whilst both unconquered stand, and neither yields:

Idyllium. VII.
Theocritus was entertained by Phrasidamus and Antigones Licop's Sons, and
invited into the Country to a feast they then kept: As He was going He meets
Lycidas the Cretan, and each sings of his Love.

To Mr. Tho Curganven.
Now Ceres feast, was come, the Corn was grown,
When I, and dear Eumedes left the Town,
Amyntas made a third; we all designed
To pay a visit to a special friend,
Rich Licop's Son, for then He kept the feast,
And kindly bad me be a welcome guest:
Rich Lycop's Son, the glory of the Plains,
For generous blood runs through his noble veins;
From Chalco down it came, the brave, the bold,
And gathered still fresh honors as it rolled.
From Chalco down, That He, by whose command
The Bourian spring of reflows the fruitful Land,
Around it Dazies grow, and all above
Tall Poplars spread, and make a shady Grove:
Scarce had we gone through half the neighboring Plain,
By Brasil's Tomb we met a museing Swain:
His name was Lycidas, the gay the young,
A Cretan born, and famed for Rural Song:
Soon as we saw him, He by all was known
To be a Goatherd, for He looked like one:
For over his shoulders hairy skins were spread,
They smelt as newly tand, or newly flead;
A tattered Mantle over his breast was cast,
And tied with an old girdle to his wast;
His right hand with a knotty Crab was filled;
He looked on me, and as he looked, he smiled:
Gay, vigorous, sweet, and in the pride of youth,
And as he spoke a smile sat on his mouth:
Where, Smichidas, where now at burning Noon,
What urgent business makes Thee leave the Town?
Whilst bleating flocks do seek the shades and cool,
And every Lizzard creeps into his hole?
What feast invites, or now I view your dress,
Who treads his Grapes, and calls you to the press?
Hark how at every step, you walk so fast,
The Stones resound, and tell you are in have:
And I replied; dear glory of the Plains
How great, how just a praise commends thy strains?
Dear skilful Piper, Fame does loudly tell
That you the Reapers, and the Swains excel,
I Am glad on it, tho I think I pipe as well.
We go to Ceres feast, this way we bend,
And make a visit to a special friend,
He keeps it now, for she has thronged his floor;
And pays the early tributes of his store:
But since we walk one way, since time persuades,
And we are far removed from gloomy shades;
Let Us Pipe, and wanton as we walk along,
For we may please each other with a Song:
For I can sing, and by our flattering Youth
I Am praised, and called the charming Muses mouth;
They say I pipe the best, and would deceive
By praise; but I Am not easy to believe:
My Songs are mean, my Pipe claims no repute
Compared to Sceli's or Phileta's Flute;
They me, and thus convince the flattering vogue,
As Locusts tunes excel the croaking Frog:
Thus I designdly; then He smiled, and said,
What glories, Smichidas, adorn thy head?
Here take this Club, this token of my Love,
It Is justly thine, thou care of mighty Jove:
I hate the Mason, that, to boast his skill,
Would raise a house to equal yonder hill:
And those that rival the Sicilian Swain,
I hate as much, and think their hopes as vain:
But come, let us sing the Song I lately made,
My Goats fed round, and wantoned as I played;
See if you like it; it has pleased the Swains,
And sounds the best and newest of the Plains:
Kind breathing Gales to Mitylenian shores
Shall wast my Agis, Nymphs shall guide his Oars;
Tho rainy South-winds angry Waves do raise,
And rough Orion steps into the Seas;
Oh would he ease my pains, give just returns,
And Love for Love, for him the Goatherd burns:
Let Halcyons smooth the Seas, the Storms allay
And skim the floods before him all the way:
The Nymphs loved bird, of all that haunt the flood,
Skim over the Waves, and dive for swimming food:
Let my dear Agis, cut the angry Tide,
And reach his Port, and there securely ride;
For then with Violets or with Roses crowned
I Will sport a Glass, and see his Health go round;
I Will tossed my Beans, to raise palled Appetite.
Make me drink on, and lengthen the Delight:
Whilst strecht on Beds I Will spend my easy hours,
And roll, till I have lost my self in flowers:
Then to his Health I Will sport a lusty Bowl,
And pour Dear Agis Love into my Soul:
Two Swains shall Pipe, the best of all the youth,
And skillful Richards voice shall join with both,
How Herdsman Daphnis did for Xenea burn,
Trace over the Woods, complaining of her scorn:
How Groves, and Echoes to his groans replied,
And smooth Himera murmured when He died:
For He, as Snow when Summer heats the Grove
Of Aetna, melted by the flame of Love:
And how when force weak Innocence oppressed,
The Swain was shut alive into a Chest.
And how the laboring Bees in every Plain
Forsook their flowers, and buz'd about the Swain,
Because the Muse had filled his charming mouth
With Nectar, and preserved the pious youth:
Happy Comatas, happy thou, the blessed
And wondrous darling at the Muses feast;
Full twelve months nourisht by the laboring Be,
Oh had I then been born and lived with Thee!
Then had I fed thy flock, and heard thy Pipe,
Paid with a tune, and hung upon thy Lip;
Whilst by a shady Tree, or purling spring
Divine Comatas, thou should sit and sing:
Thus He, then I, dear Swain, whilst over the hill
I drove the Herds, the Muse improved my skill,
Sweet tunes she taught, which same has raised above,
And bore on high to please the Ears of Jove:
But this is choicest which I Will now produce
To pleasure Thee, Thou darling of the Muse.
Love sneez'd on Smichid, for He Myrto loves
As much as Goats the Spring, or Swains the Groves:
Aratus too his dearest friend and joy,
His dear Aratus deeply loves the Boy:
And this sweet Acis knows, the gay, the young;
Acis, a theme for great Apollo's Song:
He knows how dear Aratus loves, he knows
How great his flame, and how his passion grows:
Pan, green Homala's Guardian, move the coy
The soft Philinus; and inflame the Boy;
Grown wanton, gay, and lavish of his Charms,
Uncalled for let him fly into his Arms:
Ye smileing Loves, fair Venus soft delight,
Like ruddy Apples pleasing to the sight,
Leave Bybli's fountain, leave her purling streams
That scorch the fields with her forbidden flames,
And shoot Philinus, wound his stubborn mind,
Shoot; for he has no pity for his friend;
Tho soft as Parsley, tender as the Vine,
And oh that he would clasp his Arms in mine!
Mean while the weomen cry, and shake their heads
Ah! ah! Philinus, ah thy Beauty fades!
But dear Aratus let us endure no more
Forget our Love, and fly the hated door:
And when the Cock calls forth the morning beams,
Let broaken slumbers mixed with frighful dreams
Disturb his thoughts, and by the neighboring gate
Ah! let him hang, and none bewail the Fate:
Let us mind rest, and let us provide a charm
To keep us safe, and free from future harm:
Thes'e Songs we sung, and with a cheerful smile
His Crook he gave me, to reward my skill;
Take it, He said, it is mean, yet do'nt refuse,
It is a pledge of friendship from a Muse:
This said we parted, for invain we pressed
We could not force him to the promised feast:
There Lycop's son, and all his friends around
With sweet Amyntas sat with Roses crowned:
We lay, we wantoned on a flowery bed,
Where fragrant Mastick, and where Vines were spread,
And round us Poplars raised their shady head:
Just by a spring with pleasing Murmurs flowed,
In every bush, and thicket of the wood
Sweet Insects sang, and sighing Turtles coo'd.
The laboring Bees buz'd round the purling spring,
Their Honey gathered, and forgot their sting:
Sweet Summers choicest fruits, and Autum's pride
Pears by our head, and Apples by our side
Lay round in heaps; and laden Plums did stand
With bending boughs, to meet the reaching hand:
To please us more he pierced a Cask of Wine,
It Was four years old, and from a noble Vine;
Castalian Nymphs, ye Nymphs that still reside
On steep Parnassus, and command his pride,
Did e're old Chiron, did he e're produce
For great Alcides such rich Bowls of juice?
Did Polyphem the vast Sicilian Swain,
That darted mountains over the frighted main,
Drink Wine like this, did e're such Bowls advance
His Lovesick thoughts, and raise him to a dance?
As then you gladly mixed to every guest,
And poured on Cere's Altars at her feast?
Oh may she often fill the fruitful Plain,
And may I tread the Reeks, and fix the Fan;
Whilst joyful she with smiles just thanks receives,
And holds in either hand full bending Sheaves.
Idyllium VIII.
Daphnis and Menalcas sing for a Wager, a Goatherd is chosen Judge, who
determines Daphnis his Song to be the best.

To Richard Hicks of the Mid. T. Esquire.
THE Heardsman Daphnis walking over the Plain
The gay Menalcas met, a Sheapard Swain;
Both yellow locks adorned, and both were young,
Both rarely pip'd; and both divinely sung;
Then first Menalcas raised his lovely head,
And spoke, and smiled on Daphnis as he said;
M. Come, Heardsman Daphnis will you pipe with me,
I vow I Am sure that I can conquer Thee;
I Am sure I can excel Thee as I will:

D. And Daphnis thus replied; You boast your skill
Menalcas, but I Am sure you cannot excel,
For pipe until you burst I pipe as well:

M. And shall we try?


D. Yes Swain, I know my skill;


M. And will you lay a wager?


D. Yes I will:


M. What will you lay, what equal to our fame?


D. I Will stake a Calf, you stake a full-grown Lamb:


M. I cannot stake a Lamb, for should I lose,
My Father's jealous, and my Mother cross;
These watch, They know how many Lambs I keep,
Both count my Lambs at night, and one my Sheep;

D. What then? and what shall He that conquers, gain?


M. I have a Pipe, it is new, of sounding Cane,
Waxt at both ends, and tho I Will stake no prize
That is my Father's, yet I Will venture this:

D. And I have one, white Wax both ends secures
It sounds as well, and is as new as yours:
For when I made it, as I cleft the Reeds
One pricked me, look even now my Finger bleeds;
But since we venture, since such Pipes we lay
Wha^ Man shall judge, and who shall hear us play?

M. We'el call that Goath^rd, look, the Swain is near,
Our Dog barks at him, He perhaps will hear:
The Sheapherds called, the Goatherd straight obeyed,
The Goatherd judged, and thus the Sheapherds played:
Menalcas first, then Daphnis tuned his Cane,
By turns they sang, Menalcas first began:

M. Ye Vales, ye Springs that flow from distant Seas,
If e're the sweet Menalcas Songs did please,
Then feed my Lambs, if Daphnis drives his Kine
To graze them here, feed his as well as mine:

D. Ye Herbs and Flowers, ye glory of the Vales,
If Daphnis songs are sweet as Nightingales
Then feed my Herds; if through the flowery Mead
Menalcas drives, then let his Lambs be fed:

M. There Pastures flourish, there the Duggs do fill,
The Lambs are suckled, and the Sheapherds smile
Where my Boy comes, but when He leaves the place
The Sheapherd wither's over the fading Grass:

D. There Sheep, there Goats bear twins, there laboring Bees
Do sill their Hives, and there rise prouder Trees,
Where Milo Treads, but when He leaves the place,
The Herdsman withers, and the Herd decays:

M. O Goat, the white Kids husband, stately Oaks,
O flat-nos'd Kids make have to purling Brooks
For there He is, Go, let the Boy be showed
That Proteus fed his Sea Calves, tho a God:

D. Not Pelops land, not heaps of Gold refind
I wish, nor swiftness to outstrip the Wind,
But let me fit and sing by yonde^ Rock,
Clasp thee my Dear, and view my feeding flock:

M. Rough storms to Trees, to Birds the treacherous Snare,
Are frightful evils, Springes to the Hare;
Soft Virgins love to man; Oh mighty Jove,
Not I alone, but Thou have stoopt to Love:
Thus sang the youths by turns, and pleased the Swain,
And thus Menalcas the last part began,

M. Woolf spare my Lambs, and let them safely bleat*
For I am little, and my fold is great;
How, White-foot, how so soon, so fast asleep;
Is this your care, do you thus watch my Sheep?
I faith you shall not sleep when one so young
As I, is Sheapherd; and engaged in Song:
But feed dear flock, and crop the flowery plain,
Feed, never fear, the Grass will grow again:
Fill well your duggs, that when Night spreads her vail
The Lambs may suck; and I may fill my Pail:
And next fair Daphnis sang --

D. And as I drove my Herd, a lovely Maid
Stood peeping from a Cave; She smild, and said,
Daphnis is lovely, ah a lovely youth;
What smiles, what Graces sit upon his mouth!
I made no sharp returns, but hung my head,
And went my way, yet pleased with what she said:
Winds sweetly murmur; The Steer sweetly lows,
Sweet is the Heifers voice, and sweet the Cows:
It Is sweet to ly in shades by purling streams
In Summer's heat; dissolved in easy dreams:
Acorns the Oaks, and Grass commends the Plain,
Fat Calves do grace the Cows, and Cows the Swain:
Thus sang the youths, and thus the Goatherd said;

Goatherd. Sweet is thy voice, and sweet the tunes you played
Fair Daphnis, through my Ears thy Songs have past
Sweet to the Mind, as Honey to the Taste:
And if you will teach me, if instruct the Swain,
That Goat is thine, it shall reward thy pain;
See how her Udder swells, it never will fail,
And every night it fills my largest Pail:
The Boy rejoyc't, He leapt with youthful heat,
As sucking Colts leap when they swig the Teat:
The other grieved, he hung his bashful head
As married Virgins when first laid to bed:
Thus Daphnis lived the glory of the Plains,
Was thought the best, and loved by all the Swains:
And to complete the happiness of life
The lovely Nais blessed him in a Wife.

Idyllium IX.
A Sheapherd invites Daphnis and Menalcas to sing, they pleasure him, and he
rewards them both.

To his Chum Tho. Lydgould, M.A. of Wadham. Col^.
SIng, Daphnis, sing; begin the rural lay,
Begin sweet Daphnis; next Menalcas play:
Mix Calves and Heifers, join the Bulls and Cows,
And let them feed, and wanton in the boughs.
Whilst you begin, begin the rural strain,
And next Menalcas sing, and cheer the Swain:
D. Sweet is the Heifers sound, and sweet the ^ine,
Sweet is the Pipe's, the Swain's, and sweet is mine;
By purling streams I have a shady bed,
And over white Heifers skins are neatly spread,
Ah careless Herd! they from a Mountains side
Ah cruel storm! were blown, they fell, they died:
And there I value Summer's burning heats
No more than Lovers do their Father's threats;
Their Mother's kind complaints, or friends advice:
This Daphnis sang, and next Menalcas this:

M. Me Aetna bred, to me she kindly gave
Midst hollow Rocks a large and shady Cave:
I live by pleasant Brooks, and purling Streams,
And have as much as e're you saw in dreams:
By me a thousand Goats, and flocks are fed,
And Wool lies round my feet, and round my head:
Soft Chitterlings afford me pleasing food,
And when the Winter comes I Am stored with wood;
So that I value Cold no more, not I,
Than too^hless Men do Nuts, when pulse is by:
I clapped them both, to both rewards I threw,
A Club that in my Father's Meadow grew
To Daphnis, rude as from the Woods it fell,
And yet scarce Art could shape a thing so well:
Then next Menalcas did a shell receive,
The flesh divided was enough for five,
Caught in the Icarian flood, He took the Shell,
And smiled as pleased; and liked the present well:
Hail rural Muses, hail, produce the strains,
Which once I sang, and pleased the listening Swains:
I Will boldly sing, nor midst my wondrous Song
Shall blisters rise, and gall my boasting tongue;
The Hawks to Hawks are friends, to Ews the Ews,
To Larks the Larks are friends, to Me the Muse;
Oh may I hear them still! The weary sleep,
The Spring the Ploughman, shady Plains the sheep,
Smooth Streams, and riseing flowers the laboring Be
Delight not half so much, as Muses Me;
On whom they look and smile, secure they prove
Famed Circe's Cup; nor fear the force of Love.

Idyllium X.
Battus not reaping as fast as he was wont, Milo asks him the reason, Battus
confesses it was Love, and sings a Song in praise of his Sweetheart.

To my Chum Mr. Hody of Wadham College.
Milo. AH laboring Reaper, Wretch! what ails thee now!
Thou can not reap as thou were wont to do;
Nor yet so fast; look, He has raised a Cock:
You lag, as Sheep, when pricked, behind the flock:
What will Thou do, poor wretch, before it is Noon,
What will Thou do e're shady Night comes on
Since, e're one land is cut, you fail so soon?

B. Ah Milo! thou can hold out all the day,
But I Am grown weak; ah piece of flinty clay!
Did thou never wish for One that was away?

M. Not I, for what have I that work for food
To do with Love? He is an Idle God;
Forget thy lazy thoughts, soft cares remove,

B. Then, Milo, did you never wake for Love?


M. And may it never, never break my sleep,
For Dogs, once blooded, always run at Sheep:

B. But I have loved these ten long days, or more;


M. A wealthy Man, enjoy thy fancied store,
I am, and am contented to be poor:

B. Hence it is that I Am o'rerun with lazy ease,
My Field's neglected, and my Ploughs displease,

M. But who thus wounds thee?

B. Moll, the brisk the gay,
She sung our Song, and was our Queen of May,

M. Faith rightly served, pursue thy vain delight,
How that old Fly shall clasp thee all the Night!

B. You flout; not only Pluto's Eyes are lost;
But vexing Love's; forbear, rude Swain, to boast:

M. I do not boast, but lay thy handful down,
Throw by thy hook* unbend thy gathered frown,
And sing, (for you could sing) thy slender fair,
Twill ease thy labor, and divert thy care.

Battus. With me, sweet Muse, the slender Maid rehearse,
For all looks fair that you adorn with Verse:
Bombyce charming, Sunburned, ghastly thin
You seem to many Eyes, but Brown to mine
The lettered Daffadil, and Vi'let's brown,
Yet those are chiefest Graces of a Crown:
The Goats their thyme, the Woolves the Goats pursue,
The Crane the Plough; and I am mad for you:
Oh had I Craesus store, then both should shine,
Two golden Statues fixed in Venus Shrine;
Thy Hand should grace an Apple, Harp, or Rose,
And me a danceing garb, and gaudy shows,
Bombyce charming; oh would Thou be kind!
How sweet thy voice! but who can tell thy Mind?

Milo. Hah, we never knew the value of the Swain,
How well he Measures, how he tunes his Strain!
Hah! no more sense, and yet thy beard so long!
But stay, and hear the sweet Lytersa's Song.
O fruitful Ceres bless this thriving Crop,
Increase, and make it larger than our Hope;
Ye Reapers bind the Sheaves, lest some should say
Ah lazy drones, they do'nt deserve their pay;
Or to the North your Cocks, ye Reapers rear
Or to the South, those Winds increase the Ear:
Ye Clowns that winnow never sleep at noon
For then the Chaff is loose, and quickly gone:
Reapers should rise with Larks, and sleep when They
To Roost retire, but bear the heat all day:
Frogs Lives, my boys, are blessed, for midst their Pool
They never want, their Cup is always full:
Boil, Steward, boil them whole, such pinching's mean:
You Will cut your hand whilst you divide a Bean:
Such Songs should Reapers sing that toil, and sweat,
That work at Noon, and bear the burning Heat,
But starveing Love should never vex thy head,
Such tales will bring Thee to a bit of bread,
Tales for thy Mother, as She lies a bed.

Idyllium XI.
He writes to a Physician, and tells him that the Muses are the only Remedy for
Love, which he proves by the example of Polyphemus.

To Dr. Pit of Wadham College.
IN vain, Learned Sir, invain is all your Art,
There is no Physic for a wounded heart;
No Herb can ease, no Salve the Pain remove,
There is no cure for the disease of Love
Beside the Muses; Those are soft and sweet,
And pleasing Medcines, but are hard to get:
This, Sir, you know whose skill is next divine
In Physic; you, the darling of the Nine:
Thus Polyphem found ease, the gay the young,
He cured his rageing Passion by a Song:
No mean degree of Love his breast did fire,
He was all fury, rage, and wild desire;
This single passion did his mind control,
And was the only business of his Soul:
Often did his Sheep his former chief delight,
From Pastures fed return alone at night:
Whilst on the Sedgy shore the Cyclops lay,
And singing Galatea pined away:
From Morn till Night, for Venus powerful Dart
Had galled his Liver, and had pierced his heart.
And yet He found a cure, on Rocks He stood,
And thus he sang, as he looked over the stood:
Fair Maid, and why do thou thy Love despise?
More white than Curds, and pleasing to my Eyes;
More soft than Lambs, more wanton than a Steer,
Yet harsh as Grapes unripe, and as severe:
You come when pleasing sleep has sealed my Eye,
When pleasing sleep unseals you quickly fly,
You fly with eager have, as fearful Lambs
From ravening Woolves run bleating to their Dams:
I loved Thee Nymph, I loved e're since you came.
To pluck our Flowers, from thence I date my flame:
My Eye did then my feeble heart betray,
I know the minute of the fatal day,
My Mother led you, and I showed the way:
Then when I looked, and ever since I burn,
I must Love on despairing a return:
The cause of all thy hate, dear Nymph, I know,
One large wide Gap spreads cross my hairy Brow
From Ear to Ear, one Eye does singly grace,
My Nose is flat, and even to my face:
Yet I, that ugly I, whom you refuse
Feed thousand Goats, and milk ten thousand Ews,
These give me drink, and Cheeses all the year,
See round my Cave my laden Shelves appear,
And bend beneath the weighty heaps they bear.
Besides, I live the joy of all the Plain,
No Cyclops can pretend so sweet a strain,
Thee, Thee, dear Nymph, with Thee my self I sing,
Till Midnight's past, and Morning spreads her Wing:
Ten Cubs, I forced them from an angry Bear,
Ten Does I keep; and all to please my Dear;
Come live with Me, and I sincerely vow
That your condition shall not be worse than now;
Forsake the Ocean, leave the angry Sea,
It Is better sleeping in my Cave with Me,
There Laurels grow, and there black Ivy twines,
And blushing Clusters load the bended Vines:
There are cold streams which from the melting Snow
Hot Aetna sends, a drink divine, below:
There all things are by Nature formed to please,
And who before all this would choose the Seas?
But grant that I Am deformed, unseemly rough,
Yet I am rich, and I have Wood enough,
A constant blazeing flame still heats my Cave,
I follow Heinsius.
Tho by this Eye, the dearest thing I have,
I want no outward heat, the fierce desire
That burns my Breast, is a sufficient fire;
Ah me! unhappy me, how Fate prevails!
Oh me! Had I been born with sins and scales,
That I might dive to you, cut through the Deep,
And kiss your Hand, if you refuse your Lip;
Then would I Lillies white, and Roses bring,
And all the gaudy glories of the Spring,
With Poppies blushing leaves, tho these do grow
In Summers heat, and those in frost and snow:
Well, well, I^le learn to swim, next nimble Oars
That set a Seamen on our fruitful Shores
Shall teach me how to dive, that I may know
What pleasure it is you take in Waves below:
Come forth, fair Nymph, come forth, and leave the main,
And (as I now) never mind thy home again,
But feed the Flocks with me, or milk the Sheep,
Or run the Cheese, and never mind the Deep:
My Mother's cross, her just Complaints pursue,
For she never spoak of me kind things to you,
Alltho she knew my grief, saw every day
How much I wasted, how I pined away:
I Will tell, to fright her, that my head, my thigh
Are pained: that she might grieve as well as I:
O Cyclops, Cyclops, are thy senses flown!
Is all thy former wit, and virtue gone?
Go wreath thy Baskets, cut the tender boughs
To feed the Lambs, and milk the burdned Cows,
Go mind thy Harvest work, for that will prove
Thy Wisdom greater than this whineing Love:
Take those that offer, and the proud despise,
The willing Love, and scorn the Maid that flies:
Come leave this fooling, leave this dull despair,
Another Virgin thou shallt find as fair;
For many Maids invite me still to play,
And titter all, as pleased, when I obey:
Sure I am somewhat, they my worth can see,
And I my self will now grow proud of Me:
'Thus Polyphemus cured his strong disease,
His Songs tamed Love, and gave more certain ease,
Than if He had implored the Doctor's skill,
And with just fees bought your unerring Bill.
Idyllium. XII.
A Welcome to a Friend.

To Mr. Edward Eaton.
YOU come dear youth, now three long days are gone,
You come; But Lovers do grow old in one;
As much as Spring excells the Frost and Snow,
As much as Plums are sweeter than a Sloe,
As much as Ews are thicker fleec't than Lambs,
As much as Maids excel thrice married Dames:
As much as Colts are nimbler than a Steer,
As much as Thrushes please the listening ear
More than the meaner Songsters of the Air;
So much thy presence cheers; behold, I run,
As Travelers to the shade at burning Noon:
Oh may an equal flame our hearts engage,
And let us live in Songs through future Age!
Two youths were once with mutual bands confined,
The one was generous, and the other kind:
Their Love was equal; those were golden Men,
When He that was beloved did love again:
Grant ye Immortal Powers, grant mighty Jove,
Grant this once more, increase these bands of Love;
When future Ages shall in order flow
Let some descend, and tell my shade below,
Thy Love, thy Lover's kindness, Faith and Truth,
Are praised by All, but chiefly by the youth:
But this I leave to Heaven's indulgent care,
For Heaven can grant, or can reject my Prayer.
Yet Thee I Will sing; Thee sweet, nor midst my Song
Shall tell-tale Blisters rise, and gall my Tongue:
The little pains you raised were kindly meant,
Your healing Love did all the smart prevent;
And I departed fraught with good content:
Brave Megarensians famed for nimble Oars,
May Peace flow in, and plenty crown your Shores,
The Honors you bestow on Diocles,
That constant Friend and Lover, claim no less;
At his famed Tomb each year the boys contend
Which kisses softest, which best loves his friend,
And He that kisses sweetest wins the praise,
And runs to his glad Mother crowned with bays:
Happy the Man that must bestow the prize,
Thrice happy He that judges of the Kiss!
Fair Ganymed that makes the Thunderer bow,
Whose smiles can calm, and smooth his angry brow,
Allay his fury and his rage command
And stop his lightning in his lifted hand;
Had such a Lip (or Fame has often ly'd,
And Fame errs seldom on the better side)
That like a Touchstone tried the proffered joy,
And could discern true Gold from base alloy.
Idyllium XIII.
He writes to his friend, a Physician, and tells him that Love conquers the
greatest Heroes, which He proves from the story of Hercules and Hylas.

To Mr. William Gould M.B. of Wadham College.
LOve, Love, dear Friend, what e're we think it is true,
Was not designed for only such as you;
Nor do the Charms of Beauty strike alone
Us Mortals, seen to day, to morrow gone;
But Hercules that Son of mighty Jove,
That bore the Lion's fury. stoopt to Love:
Tho rough his mind appeared, tho steeled to joy
He Hylas claspt, and loved the charming Boy:
He taught him as a Father would a Son,
To virtuous actions still He led him on:
They never parted, nor at noon, nor night,
Nor when the Morn's white Horse d^aws forth the light,
Nor when the callow Birds ly down to rest,
And careful old Ones flutter over the Nest:
That still instructing as He once began,
He might be wrought into a worthy Man:
But when stout Jason with the youths of Greece
To Colchos sailed, their prize the Golden Fleece:
When he had gathered all the Sons of fame
That could assist, the great Alcides came
To fair Jolcos, Argo's chiefest freight;
Young Hylas too. the Ship scarce felt his weight:
She, swift as Eagles, plied her nimble Oars,
And safely escaped the rough Cyanean Shores.
Which used to meet, and stave the Ships that past,
But now are fixed, on firm foundations placed:
When Summer came, and when the tender Lambs
Began to feed on Grass, and leave their Dams,
The noble Hero's, blessed with Southern Gales,
Through Hellespont did spread their swelling Sails:
Through the Propontis they did swiftly row,
Where stout Cyanean Oxen wear the Plow:
And landing there as shady Night came on
And called to eat, they sat in order down:
Soft Turfs were raised, and each possessed his place,
The Plain was large and gave them Beds of Grass.
The charming Hylas, quick as the command,
A brazen Vessel graced his lovely hand,
Ran over the Field to see what Springs afford,
And fetch some Fountain water for his Lord;
His Lord, and Telamon his constant guest,
One Table always joined them a feast:
Just by, a murmuring Spring crept over the ground,
The Banks with Vervine, and with Parsley crowned,
Within, the Nymphs, the Ladies of the Plains,
The watchful Nymphs that dance, and fright the Swains:
Eunica, Malis, and their chiefest grace
Nicoea, Spring still opens in her face:
This Hylas saw, his Cup let gently down,
Well pleased that He could serve his Lord so soon;
But straight the Nymphs, (for Love had dived below;
Their tender hearts did midst the Water glow,
The Boys fair Eyes had darted warm desire,
And through the Waves had raised a fatal Fire:)
Seized on his hand, he fell, as soret from Clouds
A falling Star shoot's down to under Floods:
Meanwhile the Boat Swain cries, Mates spread the sails
The Wind's at Stern, and we have prosperous gales:
The Nymphs danced Hylas, Kisses dried his Tears,
And Comforts were applied to ease his Fears:
But vexed Alcides, Care with Anger strove,
And tore his Breast, resolved to find his Love,
His left hand graced a Bow of fatal Ewe,
Death winged and pointed every Dart that flew;
His right a knotty Club did well command,
That constant grace and terror of his hand;
Thrice did He Hylas call, and thrice He mourned,
Thrice Hylas heard the voice, and thrice returned:
But small the sound which through the Waves did rise,
Tho near, far off he seemed; so weak the cries:
As shaggy Lions fierce by Hunger grown,
That hear a Kid or Lamb kin bleat alone,
Start from their Den, and lash their angry Breast,
And fiercely run to take their easy feast:
So He through thorny paths did wildly rove,
As mad and furious for his perished Love:
Mean while the Ship was rig'd, the Winds were fair
And sails were spread, but no Alcides near;
He far removed did rove through Paths untrod
For Love had galled his breast, a cruel God:
Hence Hylas grew a God, and graced a shrine,
His Love and Beauty made him half divine;
Mean while the Heroes fired with martial rage
Alcides blamed as fearful to engage,
It argued not his Love, but proved his fear
To leave the Ship, and so decline the War;
But he on foot to barbarous Phasis came,
And noble actions soon redeemed his Fame.
Idyllium XIV.
Eschines being scorned by Cunisca, who had a greater kindness for one Woolf,
resolves to turn Soldier; His Friend Thynichus advises him to serve King
Ptolomy.

To his Friend and Tutor Mr. Balch of Wadham Coll.
E. GOod morrow Thynicus.


T. The like to you;


E. But why so late?


T. So late? What ails thee now?


E. All is not well:


T. I see it, you look so thin,
Your Face not washed, your Beard spread over your Chin, now?
Your Eyebrows thick, last night I chanced to view
^ Poor Phythagorist, and He looked like you:
^^^le, barefoot, an Athenian, as He said,
But, says, He looked as if on Meal He fed:

E. You joque; But fair Cunisca scorns my Love,
And as her hatred so my flames improve,
And the perhaps I no such heats betrayed
Yet I Am wit^in an Inch of stareing mad:

T. You still were passionate, you still pursue
What your perverse desire has once in view,
But preth^e tell me what disturbs anew:

E. Tom, Will, an^ Dick, and I, a jovial Crew,
Not minding Fate that did too close pursue,
Drank at my House, the Glass went briskly round,
Our hearts were merry, and each head was crowned;
I made them welcome, got the best I could,
A sucking Pig, two Chicken, Country food,
And, tho I say it my self, my Wine was good:
It Was four years old, yet mild, I vow it is true,
With Burrage mixed it drank as well as new:
At last we voted each should crown a Glass
What Health he pleased, but name whose health it was;
We drank, and halloo'd, She mute all the while
And sullen sat, without one word or smile;
How was I vexed to find a change so soon?
What Mute? what have you seen a Alludcing to the common saying.
Woolf says one?
At that she slusht, her guilty color rose,
That you might light a Candle at her Nose:
There Is Woolf, there is Woolf, my Neighbor Labia's Son,
Tall, slender, and the beauty of the Town:
For him she burns, and sighs, and sighs again,
And this I heard, but loath to find my pain,
I let it lie, and grew a Man invain:
When we were heated well, and slusht with Win^,
One sang a Song of Woolf, a cursed design,
For straight Cunisca wept at the surprise,
And soon betrayed her passion at her Eyes;
She wept as wanton Girls that leave their Pap,
And would be dandled on their Mother's Lap:
Then I, you know me, vexed at this disdain;
Fled at her, struck, and swore, and kicked again;
She rose; Oh Mischief! can I please no more?
Have you another Sweetheart? Out you Whore;
Must you do this now to confirm my fears?
Go to him, toy, and court him with your tears:
As swift as Swallows sweeping over the Plain,
To catch their young a fly, with nimble pain,
Catch one, then feed, and straight return again;
So quick she left her Seat, so swift her have,
So soon she through the Hall and Parlor past,
I scarce could see her move, she went so fast:
Now twenty days, and ten, and nine, and eight,
And one, and two are past; two months complete;
Yet still we differ, nor in all this space
Have I shaved once, regardless of my face:
But she is Woolf's, and Woolf's her chief delight,
For him she will unlock the Gate at night,
But I am scorned, I cannot be looked upon,
Sh^e'l scarce vouschase the favor of a f^own:
And yet, Dear friend, could I but break the chain
And hate her once, all would be well again,
But as the Proverb says, the heedless Mouse
Has bitten Pitch, and how shall he get loose?
What Physic can these vexing Pains remove!
I know no Cure for the disease of Love,
Yet Dick, my friend, that equal pains endured
For Betty, traveled, and was quickly cured:
And says I Will travel too, I scorn to boast
My Courage, yet I think I Am stout as Most:

T. I wish Thou had enjoyed thy just desire,
And gained thy Love; But if Thou willt retire
Serve Ptolomy, for He Will reward thy pain,
Believed, He loves a stout and honest Man;

E. What other Virtues!


T. Oh the greatest Mind,
The sweetest: temper, Generous, and Kind,
He marks his friend, but more he marks his foe,
His hand is allways open to bestow:
Petition modestly He grants the thing,
And freely gives as it becomes a King;
And therefore, Lover, if you bravely dare
To ty your Snapsack on, and go to War,
If Thou can keep thy Post, and stand thy ground,
And throw back on thy foe the comeing wound,
To Egypt have, make have, e're youth decays,
First from our Temples Age begins her race,
Thence whitening Time creeps softly over the face:
Go on whilst youth is Green, and strength do last,
For when old Age draws nigh, the Time is past.

Idyllium XV.
Two tatling Gossips go to see the Pomp at Adonis 's Feast, prepared by Arsinoe
Ptolomy Philadelphus 's Queen; The humors of the Weomen he hitts exactly;
intermixes some praises of the King, and describes the Glory of the Pomp to
gratify the Queen.

The Persons are Gorgo, Eunoe, Praxinoe, Nurse, Stranger and Mother.

To Mr. Rice Williams of Wadham Coll.
G. SWeetheart, is my Praxinoe at home?


E. She is dear Gorgo, but how late you come?


P. I scarce expected you, and sat alone,
A Chair and Cushion,

E Ready:


P. Pray sit down:


G. Ah me, I scarce could get alive along
So close the people press, so great the throng;
Coaches through every Street, and Liveries shine;
Beside your dwelling is so far from mine:

P. Yes, my cross Sot must leave his former Seat,
And on the edge of the World choose this retreat,
More like a filthy Cave than like a House,
And this he does, kind heart, to separate us,
My constant plague, and my continual cross.

G. Soft words, pray Madam, soft, see here is your Son,
Look how he eyes you, and begins to frown:

P. Cheer up my Child, I did not mean thy Dad,


N. He understands her, he is a pretry Lad:


P. He went last night, (old faults are all forgot,)
To buy some Soap, and what d' ye think he bought?
Bay Salt, longsided Fool, dull Booby Sot:

G. Ah me, and mine is as bad, a squandring fool,
Last Market day he went to cheapen Wool,
And there five Fleeces for five Crowns he bought,
All coath'd Sheep's Wool, mere dirt, not worth a Groat:
But take your Hood and Scarf, and pray let us go,
Let Us have to Court, for there is a gaudy show:
Adonis Feast, and as I lately heard
Our Royal Queen has glorious sights prepared:

P. Great Folks have all things fine, but pray now tell
What you, for I saw naught, or naught so well:

G. Another day, but now the minute calls,
We that have naught to do have time for tales:

P. Maid, Water quickly, faith I Will break your head,
Go set it down; These Cats so love a bed,
Drive them away, they will spoil my Cloth of State,
But first the Water, there is most need of that:
See how she speeds! come pour: but why so soon?
A little more: what makes you wet my Gown?
Well, now I Am fairly washed the Gods be blessed,
But bring me straight the Key of my great Chest:

G. This Mantoe sits extremely well, I vow,
What prize the Stuff? pray Madam let me know:

P. It cost me twenty Shillings half a Crown,
It Was dear, beside the work was all my own:

G. It Is rare;


P. Your Servant, Madam, bring my Hood,
And Scarf, and dress me in the newest Mode;
Dear Chuck, you must not go, my dear delight,
For there are Bugbears, and the Horses bite,
Nay you may cry, peace, peace, dear Mother's Child,
Nay cry, but, Chuck, I must not have you killed:
Here Betty take the Boy, and stay at home,
Call Pretty in, and wait here till I come.
O Jemminy, dear Gorgo, here is a throng,
I wonder how we two shall get along:
Great Ptolemy, beside a thousand things
In which Thou have excelld the former Kings;
How many profits have thy care bestowed
Since Lagus died and rose into a God?
None now, as heretofore, infest the Street,
Pick pockets, crowd, and justle all they meet,
What shall we do? you see we strive invain,
Ah Dear, I wish I was at home again:
The Kings great Horses come, stand farther, friend,
Don't tread upon me, see he rears an end,
Look how he bounds, oh whether shall we run?
Alas poor Soul, he will throw his Rider down,
Well, I am glad I did not bring my Son:

G. Cheer up Praxinoe, come, the danger's past,
And they are gone before, let us mend our have:

P. Well, now I Am comeing to my self again,
A Horse, and a cold Serpents winding train
^allways hated; fie, we move too slow,
Look there behind what Tides of People flow!

G. Mother is it you within?


M. Yes Child, it is I,


G. Can we get in pray Mother?


M. Daughter try:
For he that never trys can never enjoy;
The Greeks by trying, Daughter, conquered Troy:

P. She leaves us with a Riddle, what she means
God knows, but sure she has some hidden sense.
Weomen know all below, and all above,
Even how Queen Juno was betrothed to Jove:
But look Praxinoe, how the People wait,
How great a throng attends the crowded Gate:

P. A vast one Gorgo: come, it is best to join,
Hands round; here Gorgo, clap your hand in mine:
Take Eutick Eunoe, that we may not loose
Each other, come, thrust all, and still keep close:
Ah me, my veil is rent, pray, why do you press?
My Gown! Good Sir, may Heaven conspire to bless,
And you be happy Sir, as you forbear;

S. I cannot, yet I Will take the greatest Care:


P. The Crowd increases, and they thrust like Swine,


S. Come cherr up Madam, we are all got in:


P. Well, may the bounteous Gods reward thy pain
For helping us, thou art an honest Man,
Poor Eunoe's justled still, she will lose her Hood,
Thrust Eunoe, stoutly thrust, and break the Crowd;
We are all in, as One (a Story) said
When he had got his Mistress fast in Bed:

G. Praxinoe look, what Hangings grace the Rooms,
How fine, how rich, sure wrought in Heavenly Looms:
Oh strange, what hands could these fine things design?
What Mortal Pencil draw so sweet a line?
How real they appear? They seem to move,
They are alive, I Am sure they cannot be wove:
Man's a wise thing, but see on yonder bed
Adonis lies, Down over his Cheeks is spread,
Lovely Adonis, loved amongst the Dead:

S. Hist, hist, your tatling silly talk forbear,
Like Turtles you have Mouths from Ear to Ear:

G. And who are you? Pray what have you to say
If we will talk? Seek those that will obey,
Would you the Syracusian Weomen rule?
Besides, to tell you more you meddling Fool,
We are Corinthians, that is no great disgrace,
B^llerophon himself did boast that race:
We speak our Language, use the Dorick tone,
And, Sir, the Doors, sure, may use their own:

P. Our Husbands are enough, let none pretend
To rule beside; you are a saucy friend,
I Am never beholding to ye, and there is an end:

G. Peace, peace Praxinoe, straight in charming lays
A Maid shall sing the dead Adonis praise,
More soft than Sperchis in a mournful Song,
Hark, she prepar's her voice, it will not be long*
Great Goddess, joy of the Idalian Grove,
To whom high Eryx Bows, fair Queen of Love,
How charming was thy sweet Adonis lead
By soft-soot hours from midst the silent Dead?
The twelfth month came, when from the shades below
Restord, what Beauty sat upon his Brow?
The Hours the slowest of the Gods, it is true,
Yet pleasing, for they still bring something new:
Kind you (thus story says) did first remove
Fair Berenice to the Seats above,
And bathed the Mortal in a Cup of Love:
And now Arsinoe, Helen's equal face,
^ust return does thy Adonis grace
With all the fruit the various Earth can yield,
The Silver Basket brings from every field
The choicest Flowers that please the curious Eye:
In Gold the Syrian Odors breath, and dye:
Of Flour and Honey mixed the sweetest Cake
That Weomen's Luxury or Art can make:
The Earth and Sea do give a vast supply,
And Air sends all the various Kinds that fly:
She raises fresh imaginary Groves,
And all around do flutter wanton Loves,
As new-fledgd Thrushes whilst the old one sings
Do leap from bough to bough, and try their Wings:
O Gold! See there two Ivory Eagles fly
And bear young Ganymed through the yielding Sky:
See Purple Tapestry more soft than s^eep,
This He Will confess that feeds Milesian Sheep:
Oh happy Riches, see, two Beds are Made,
And Venus here, there fair Adonis laid,
A youthful Bridegroom, just mature for Bliss,
No prickly Beard makes rough his pleasing Kiss:
Let Venus have him, and his sweets embrace,
To morrow e're the Dew forsakes the Grass
We Will bear him where the Waves foam round the shore
Our Hair all loose, our Coats let down before,
Our Breasts all bear, and as we march along
With mournful voice, begin this Funeral Song:
Adonis, of the Heroes you alone
Now come to Us, now go to Acheron;
Not Agamemnon, not stout Ajax knew,
And none enjoyed the favor like to you:
Not Hector, fruitful Priam's stoutest joy,
Not Pyrrhus comeing from his conquered Troy:
The Ancient Lapithae Ducalion's race,
Or brave Pelasgi Argo's chiefest grace:
Kind now Adonis, next year kind remain,
Now welcome, welcome when you come again:

G. Ah dear Praxinoe, these are Curious things,
O happy Creature, oh how well she sings!
But I must go, for should m^ Husband come,
He has not dined, and not find me at home,
How he would fret, He Is pettish, hates delay,
Nor when He Is hungry would I come in^s way.
Farewell Adonis, now thy Pomp must cease;
But still return, and still our joys increase.

Idyllium XVI.
He complains that Poetry meets not a suitable Reward from Great Men, for that
immortality which it bestows upon them.

To his very good Friend John Dryden Esquire.
THis is the Muses, this the Poets care
To sing the Gods, and Men renowned for War:
The Muses Goddesses make Gods their theme,
We Men sing Men, and raise them vast esteem?
But who that lives below our pains regards?
What open hand does pour out fit rewards?
Who does receive us when we offer Fame?
And send us back more wealthy than we came?
The Muses baffled thus turn home again
With naked feet, they sigh, they weep, complain,
And frown at Me, when they have gone invain.
Deep in the bottom of my empty Clest,
A place too hollow, and too hard for rest,
They sit and mourn; on their cold knees they lay
Their bending heads, and sigh, and pine away:
For who is brave? and who regards a Wit?
I know not; few, ah few in praise delight:
For great and noble deeds as heretofore;
Their Captive thoughts are tied to baser Ore:
Their covetous hands they in their laps do fold,
And scarce will give the Rust that eats their Gold:
They cry, near is my Shirt, more near my Skin,
Must I supply the hunger of the Nine?
Let me grow rich in wealth, and Those in sense,
A Poet is the care of Providence:
What need of more since Homer lives? He brings
No charge upon me, yet's the best that sings.
Poor Men! what profits precious Ore that lies
Heap't up within to feed the greedy Eyes?
It yields a different profit to the wise:
Some on themselves some part on Wits they spend,
Some part their Kinsmen share, and some their friend;
To every Man from them some goods accrue,
And still the Gods receive their sacred due:
He Is kind and generous, nobly treats his guests,
He never cloys, but pleases with his feasts.
But chiefly to the Muses Sons they give,
That after Death their lasting fame may live:
And that they may not sit and mourn below,
As those whose hands are hardened by the Plough
Who sit, and sigh; and with a sad complaint
For ever weep hereditary Want:
Antiochus once kept a kingly board,
A thousand Menial Servants called him Lord:
A thousand Heifers fed at Scopa's stall,
Ten thousand horned Bulls lowed through his vale,
The kind Creondae fed their numerous Flocks,
Their brouzing Goats still hung on Thousand Rocks:
Yet when their naked Souls began to float
Breathed out in Air, and stowed in Charon's Boat,
They left their wealth beyond the Stygian shore,
The crazy Vessel could not waft their Ore;
And each had lain amidst the vulgar, lost,
Unheard, untalkt of, like a common Ghost,
Unless his Poet with exalted rage
Had struck his Harp, and given them future Age.
It Is Verse that does with lasting Honor's grace
The swiftest Horse that wins the sacred race:
His Crowns had withered he had lost his name,
Too slow to keep an equal pace with Fame:
Who had the Lycians, who the Trojans known?
What Fame once-female Cycnus Glory blown?
Unless a Poet with immortal Song
Had told their fights, and made their Wars so long?
Ulysses, He through various dangers tossed
For seven long years, that touched at every Coast,
That He that saw the Stygian shades and lived,
That escaped the Cyclops, had his fame survived;
Eumaeus, mingled with the Common Dead,
Had lain as nameless as the Ox he fed,
And wholly vanished with his parting breath,
If Homer had not snatched his name from Death:
The Muses raise Men's worth, their Fame they spread,
Whilst Heirs consume the riches of the Dead:
And it is a task I Am sure of equal ease
To tell how many Tempests toss the Seas,
With what fierce Storms the troubled Ocean roars,
How many Waves it rouls to trembling Shores,
To wash a Blackmore white, as to unbind
A Gripeing Niggard's close contracted mind,
And force him to be generous and kind:
A Curse on such, vast heaps of useless Ore
May those enjoy, and yet still wish for more;
'Twas allways so, and it is my humor still,
Much more than Wealth I value Men's good will:
And now I seek what Patron I may choose,
And where I may be welcome with my Muse:
For Poets find but small returns of Love
Without their Muse, thus stands the will of Jove:
The Heaven's not weary whilst it whirls the Sun,
And thousand Steeds shall draw the Chariot on,
A Man shall rise that shall my Songs employ
As great as famed Achilles fought at Troy:
As great as Ajax where smooth Simois flowed,
And Phrygian Ilu's Tomb lay drowned in Blood;
The Carthaginians dread approaching War,
Forget their fury, and consent to fear:
The Syracusian Troops spread ore the field,
Their right-hands grace a Spear, their left a shield;
These Hiero leads as ancient Heroes brave,
His dreadful Crest does over his Shoulders wave:
But oh our Guardian Jove, revenge our Blood,
And toss our Foes over the Sardinian flood,
Scatter their force, and send few home to tell
The Wives and Children how their Fathers fell:
Let old Inhabitants possess their Isle;
And raise new Towns where Foes did lately spoil;
The Fields be green, and through the fruitful Plain
Great flocks of Sheep grow fat, and bleat again:
The laboring Oxen bend beneath the Plough,
And, slowly walking through the Valleys, low:
The Fields be reapt whilst under every shade
The Insects sing, and make the Reapers glad:
The Spiders weave in Sheilds, all free from fear,
And hardly know the very name of War:
Let riseing Poets bear the sounding praise
Of Hiero beyond the Scythian Seas;
Beyond proud Babylon extend his Fame,
And tell to distant worlds his glorious Name:
I am but one, but more Jove's Daughters love,
More wise than I am, and more apt to move:
And these smooth Arethusa's streams shall sing,
The brave Sicilians, and their valiant King:
Ye Goddesses that Orchomenium grace
The scourge and hatred of the Theban race,
Uncalled I Will stay, to those that shall invite
My Muse shall offer honor and delight:
I Will never leave you; what will Men receive
Without the Graces? what is fit to give?
O, may I ever with the Graces live!
Idyllium XVII.
A Panegerick to King Ptolemy.

To Ambrose Brown of -- Esquire.
BEgin with Jove, my Muse, and end with Jove,
If you would sing the greatest God above,
But if you would the best of Men rehearse,
Let Ptolemy's great name adorn your Verse;
Let him the first, midst, last, your Songs employ,
The darling of Mankind, the common joy:
The Heroes born of Gods, and great in fame,
Had noble Poets to record their name;
And I, well skilled in Song, with lasting lays
Sing him, Even Gods we do reward with praise:
In shady Ida, where the Woods are thick,
The Woodman comes, but doubts where first to strike
And where shall I? there crowd a thousand things,
With which the Gods have blessed the best of Kings:
His father Lagus, who so bravely great?
So deeply skilled in all the Arts of State?
What Age could boast a Prince so great so good?
His Mind was high, and noble as his Blood:
Him Jove does grace with an immortal Throne,
And give a golden Palace next his own:
Next Alexander sits, the Wise, the Great,
A miter'd God, and checks the Persian State:
Just opposite Alcides Throne does shine,
Of sparkling Diamond, the work divine;
And whilst on Nectar with the Gods he feasts,
He smiles too see his race his equal guests:
On each great Jove repreive from Age bestowed,
And called immortal, raised into a God:
When fragrant Nectar Bowls have raised his fires,
And from the feast he to his Wife retires,
His Ensigns he delivers to the Two
One bears his knotty Club, and one his Bow;
With these they both in decent order move,
And thus to beauteous Hebe's bed of Love
Their father lead, the great increase of Jove:
How Berenice shone! His charming Bride,
Her Sexe's glory, and her Parents pride;
Her Venus nursed with a peculiar care,
And blessed with all the charms that grace the fair;
That even bold Fame it self scarce dares to tell
That any Prince e're loved his Wife so well
As generous Ptolemy his beauteous Queen;
And yet he meets with greater love again!
He Quits his State, and business of his Thrones,
He leaves his Kingdom to his Loyal Sons,
Whilst he to her with hasty wishes moves,
And goes to play the Hero in his Loves:
A faithless Wife lets all her thoughts and cares
On others rove, with easy pains she bears,
Her House is full, but of the numerous race
Not one can show the joyful Father's face:
Fair Venus chiefest Beauty of the Sky
She lived thy care, nor can her honor dye;
Your kindness snatched her from the Stygian shore,
E're grisly Charon came to waft her over,
You gave a shrine, and taught us to adore:
Just like a falling Star thrown down by Fate;
You caught, and made her Partner of your State;
Thence kind to all she gentle Cares inspires;
And warms the Lovers breasts with pleasing fires:
The fair Deipale did to Peleus bear
Stout Diomed, that mighty Son of War,
And beauteous Thetis to her Peleus bore
The famed Achilles on the Grecian shore,
But Berenice has these Births outdone,
She brought great Ptolemy as great a Son;
First Coos danced Thee, Thee, Mankind's delight,
She took Thee at thy first approach to light,
For there thy Mother to Lucina prayed
To ease her throws, and found a speedy Aid;
She came, stood by, and gently loosed her pain,
Thy very birth was easy as thy reign:
The Island took Thee in her Arms, and smiled
To view the Father's Image in the Child:
She shouted, and she said, Ah lovely Boy,
Be born, Thy Father's Soul, be born my joy:
Welcome, on me as great a Fame bestow,
As Delos does to her Apollo owe:
Thus spoke the I'sle; an Eagle soared above
And mixed with Clouds; the Bird of mighty Jove,
With joyful sound thrice clapped auspicious Wings,
'Twas Jove's own sign, Jove is the Guard of Kings:
But whom he loves as soon as he began,
That lives the Potent, that the happy Man
All else must yield, and over the Sea and Land
With conquering Arms he spread a wide command:
A thousand Nations boast their fruitful Plains,
Where gentle Jove descends in easy rains,
But none such Crops as sandy Egypt shows,
Where Nile with his enriching streams o'reflows,
And what the barren Clouds deny, bestows:
No Nation bears, no Nation boasts to see
So many Towns, and Men of Art as She,
Full Thirty Thousand Towns enjoy the sway
Of Ptolemy, and eagerly obey:
The stout Phaenicians too have felt his Sword,
Arabia, Syria, Lybia call him Lord;
The Ethiopians, the Pamphilian Horse,
The Lycians, Carians own his nobler force:
The Isles; for where his Navy spreads her Wings
Homage to Him, and Peace to all she brings:
So far his Scepters reach, and Sea, and Land
And purling Streams obey his just Command:
Vast Troops of Horse and Foot well armed for War
So dreadful gay in graceful ranks appear,
That even their proudest Foes consent to fear:
His Treasure richer than e're known before,
And other Kings scarce wish so great a store;
All Nations send their Customs every day,
And their due Tribute to his Ocean pay:
The Farmer fearless ploughs his fruitful soil,
No Hostile Navies press the quiet Nile;
None leaps a Shore, and frights the laboring Swains,
None robs us of our Flocks, and spoils the Plains:
Thus Ptolemy secures his Land from Harms,
So feared by All he sits, so great in Arms:
So careful to preserve his ancient right,
This shows a King, and for new Conquests fight:
And yet he does not hoord his useless Ore,
As painful Ants still turn their buried store;
With much the Temples of the Heroes shine;
His first fruits, and his gifts sill every shrine,
Much Gold to powerful neighboring Kings he sends,
Much to his Subjects, much to valiant Friends:
None famed for Song, none great in Arts appears
No charming voice can ravish listening Ears,
But straight He favors, He rewards imparts,
And sends them presents equal to their Arts:
And therefore Poets with exalted rage
Send down their Patron's praise to future Age;
At what more noble can the wealthy aim
Than to secure a fair, and lasting Fame?
Of Great Atrides this remains alone,
Whilst are the Stores of Wealth He raised, are gone:
What e're he brought from Troy has escaped the light,
And now lies buried in Eternal night.
He first his Glorious Parents made divine,
To both He incense burns, and rears a shrine:
How great they stand! how Gems their shrines enfold,
And hide the Ivory, and the poorer Gold!
How great they stand! what various goods bestow!
Supply our wants, and guard frail Man below:
He stains red Altars with a Thousand Beasts
As Months roll round, and bring the solemn Feasts:
He and his Queen, than whom kind Fortune led
No fairer Woman to a greater Bed;
There She with joy the Natural ties improves,
And both as Brother, and as Husband loves:
This Gods approve, thus they themselves are tied,
And Juno lives Jove's Sister, and his Bride;
Fair perfumed Iris makes one Bed for both,
Where Pleasure's hightned by eternal youth:
Hail glorious Ptolemy, hail mighty King;
Thee equal to the Gods my Muse shall sing;
And future Age shall all my Songs approve;
Great King, beg Virtue, and increase of Jove:
Idyllium XVIII.
An Epithalamium at the Marriage of Helena and Menelaus.

To Edward Courthope Esquire.
AT Sparta's Palace twenty beauteous Maids,
The Pride of Greece, fresh Garlands crowned their heads
With Hyacinth and twineing Parsley dressed,
Graced joyful Menelaus Marriage Feast;
When lovely Helen great in conquering charms
Resigned her willing Beauty to his Arms:
They danced around, Joy flowed from every tongue,
And the vast Palace sounded with the Song:
And why fair Bridegroom why so sleepy grown,
And why to Bed e're shady Night comes on?
What have you danct too much? Wine seized your head,
Or are you drowsy, that you must to Bed?
But if you needs must sleep, then sleep alone,
But why must Helen too your Bride be gone?
Why must She leave her tender Mother thus?
She should sit up, and play, and dance with us,
She should sit up till the bright Sun should rise,
And Stars recede less beauteous than her eyes:
For, Menelaus, She for all thy life
For Morning, Night, and Noon must be thy Wife:
O happy Bridegroom! Thee a lucky sneeze
To Sparta welcomed, where the youths of Greece
Her chiefest Pride, did offer humble Love,
Yet you were chose to be allied to Jove:
A Beauty, such as never Greece did view,
Now sleeps between the common Sheets with you:
O happy Bridegroom, what thy Bride shall bear
If like her self, it must be wondrous fair:
Two hundred Spartan Maids, her Equals We,
That wrestled, fought, and ran as well as She,
And even out did the Men; yet none appear
A spotless Beauty if compared to Her:
Just as the Morning shows her lovely face,
When Winter's gone, and lazy Night withdraws,
Just so does Helen's charming Beauties rise,
Tall, fair and framed by Nature to surprise:
As Trees a Field, swift Steeds a Chariot grace,
So Sparta is adorned by Helen's face:
In all the Bride does easily excel,
None Spins with so much Art, none Weaves so well:
When She Diana or Minerva sings,
None tunes so soft as She the speaking strings;
That She, whose motions Charm, whose looks surprise,
And Thousand Cupids wanton in her Eyes:
Ah fair, ah lovely, of an envied life,
Ah fair, and blessed in being made a Wife;
But we will run through yonder spacious Mead,
And crop flesh flowery Crowns to grace thy head;
Mindful of Helen still, as tender Lambs
Not weaned as yet when hungry mind their Dams:
We Will first low Lotus pluck, and Crowns compose
And to thy Honor grace the shady Boughs,
From Silver Boxes sweetest Oils shall flow,
And press the Flowers rhat rise as sweet below,
And then inscribe this line, that all may see,
Pay due Obedience, I am Helen's Tree:
All Joy fair Bride, and happy Bridegroom joy,
Let kind Latona give a lovely Boy,
Let Venus, Goddess Venus mutual Love,
And lasting Riches be bestowed by Jove;
That still they may descend, and grace the Throne
From noble Father, to a noble Son:
Sleep in each other Arms, and raise desire,
Let ardent breathings fan your mutual Fire,
But rise betimes, forget not, we will return
When first the crowing Cock shall wake the Morn,
When through his feathered throat He sends his voice:
O Hymen, Hymen at this Feast rejoice:
Idyllium XIX. On Love stung by a Be.
WHen Wanton Love designed to theive,
And steal the Honey from the Hive,
An impious Be his Finger stung,
And thus revenged the proffered wrong;
He blew his Fingers vexed with pain,
He stamped, and star'd but all in vain,
At last unable to endure
To Venus runs, and begs a cure;
Complaining that so slight a touch
And little thing should wound so much:
She smiled, and said, Son, Thou art like a Be,
Little, yet how great wounds are made by Thee!
Idyllium XX.
A Shepherd complains of the coyness of a City Maid, who refused his proffered
Kiss.

To His good Humor'd Friend Mr. Alexander Crook of Wadham College.
EVnica flouted me, She scorned my Kiss
And when I proffered, answered with a hiss;
Begone rough Shepherd thou do ask invain,
I faith I am not used to Kiss a Swain,
The City Lips I press, and only them,
Thou should not Kiss me, no, not in a Dream:
How odd thy Courtship! and how dull thy jest!
How languishing thy words, and how expressed!
How soft and sweet thy voice! thy looks how fair!
How smooth thy Chin! what Curls adorn thy Hair!
Thy Lips are broken out, and black thy hand,
Thy smell is rank, B^gon, I shall be stained.
This said then thrice she spit, and viewed me round
From head to foot, and muttered still, and frownd,
Still scornfully she looked, and mighty proud
Of her fair Face, she sneerd, and laughed aloud,
My blood began to boil, my face was flusht,
And, like a Rose with Dew o'recharg'd, I blushed:
She left me straight, but I am vexed at this
That she proud Slut should flout, when I would Kiss:
Am I not Handsome? tell me smiling Swains,
For I was once the Beauty of the Plains,
Tell me, have I no charms, no pleasing grace,
Or has some God oth' sudden changed my face?
For I was handsome once, my Cheeks were red,
My Beard like Ivy round an Oak was spread,
And bushy hair like Parsley crowned my head:
My snowy forehead two black Eyebrows crossed,
My Eyes as gray as Palla's self could boast,
My Mouth more sweet than Curds, my words did slow
As smooth as Oil, and soft as falling Snow:
My Songs are charming, whilst my Flocks do feed
I blow my Hougtboy, Pipe, or Oaten reed,
Often have I seen my Lambs forsake their grass
And listening by with silent wonder gaze;
And all the Country Maids my Face esteem,
They kiss, and beg me I would stay with them:
Are these small charms, that she should these despise?
But I Am a Shepherd Swain, for that she flys,
For that the City Maids refuse a Kiss,
Well, let them scorn, poor fools, they hardly know
That beauteous Bacchus, fed a Herd below,
Or that fair Venus wantoned with a Swain,
And fed his Cattle in the Phrygian Plain,
With sweet Adonis often she proved the Joy
In Groves, in Groves she mourned the lovely Boy:
Endymion was a Swain, he kept a flock,
And yet for him the Moon her Skies forsook,
She scorned a Scepter and embraced a Crook:
One Cave held both, with him she reapt delight,
Came down, lay by, and kisst him all the night:
Even Rhea mourns a Swain, and mighty Jove
Took Eagle's Wings, and bore a Swain above:
A Swain this proud Eunica scorns alone,
Better than Venus, Rhea, or the Moon:
Venus, the fault was yours, you taught her pride,
May, therefore, thine, thy Love be still denied;
May you endure an injured Lover's pain,
Never kiss thy Sweet, never wanton over the Plain,
But lie alone all night, and wish in vain.
Idyllium XXI.
A discourse of two Fishermen upon a Dream.

To Mr. Tho. Dunstar of Wadham College.
IT IS Poverty, dear Friend, improves our Arts,
It teaches Wit, and working thoughts imparts;
For Cares chase Sleep from his laborious head
Who sweats to earn, before he eats his bread:
If lazy slumbers over his eyes do creep,
Straight noisy cares rush in, and break his sleep.
Two good old Fishers slept, their bed was Sedge,
Their Roof was Straw, their Walls a rotten Hedge,
And round just by lay Baskets, Hooks, and Lines,
Their Wiers, Sedgy Nets, their Rods, and Skins,
Drawn up on some old Plank a tattered Boat,
Their Pillow Straw, their Rugg a ragged Coat,
Their Caps hung by upon a broken Oar,
These were there tackling, and this all their store.
Not one small Pot upon their Shelf was laid,
All useless seemed but what concerned their trade;
Thus blessed they lived, and happy in content
With their Companions, Poverty and Want:
No neighbor near, and every riseing tide
Their Hovel reached, and shook its tottering side:
From midst of Heaven the Moon viewed all below,
When dreams of Labor wakt the sleeping two;
Each with his Thumb wiped rest from off his Eyes,
And sang, and cheered themselves with these replies:
A. They lie, dear friend, that say the night decays
When Summer comes, and Jove brings longer days;
For I have seen a thousand dreams to night
Long tedious dreams, and yet it is far from light;

B. You blame the Summer, but unjustly blame,
The Hours are still forced on, their pace the same;
But vexing Cares, that in a buisy throng
Disturb your head, do make night seem so long:

A. Can you interpret Dreams, Friend, tell me true,
I Have dreamt fine things, which I would tell to you:
For that will ease me, and divert my Care,
As we our Fish, so we our Dreams will share:

B. Then tell thy friend.


A. If you remember well
We suppt too late, and made a spareing meal:
On yonder shelving Rock methought I stood,
And stoopt, intent upon the quiet flood;
I saw the Fish, my Hook let gently down,
And shook my cheating Bait to draw them on:
A great one bit, (for Fish is still my Theme,
As Dogs of bones, so I of fishes dream)
I struck, and hung him fast, I saw the Blood,
The weight was great, I Am sure it bent the Rod;
I strove to reach him, for my Line was weak,
And faith, I feared my bending Hook would break,
Do prick me, for he pricked, I Will grasp the more,
And so at last I drew my prey to shore;
A golden Fish, I stood amazed, and feared
'Twas one of Neptune's own beloved herd:
Or one of Sea green Amphitrite's train,
A noble Fish, the treasure of the Main:
I loosed him gently, and did stricktly look
That no small grain stuck round the rugged Hook:
With Cords I drew him, and devoutly swore,
That I would venture out to Sea no more;
But stay at home, and make my self a King:
At this I wakt, do you adjust the thing,
Pray tell me what you think, for I Am afraid
That I am bound to keep the Oath I made:

B. Fear not, my friend, you did not swear, for why,
You found no Fish, a Vision's but a lie:
And therefore go, and draw the usual streams,
Seek real Fish, no^ starve with golden dreams.

Idyllium XXII.
A scorned Shepherd hangs himself, the cruel fair is killed by the Statue of
Cupid.

To Mr. Rily Painter to his Majesty.
AN Amorous Shepherd loved a charming Boy,
As fair thought could frame, or wish enjoy,
Unlike his Soul, illnatur'd and unkind,
An Angels body with a Fury's mind:
How great a God Love was, He scorned to know,
How sharp his arrows, and how strong his bow,
What rageing wounds he scatters here below.
In his address and talk fierce, rude, untame,
He gave no comfort to the Shepherd's flame:
No cherry Lips, no Rose his Cheeks did dye,
No pleasing Fire did sparkle in his Eye,
Where eager thoughts with fainting Virtue strove,
No soft discourse, nor Kiss to ease his Love:
But as a Lion on the Lybian Plain
Looks on his Hunters, he beheld the Swain:
His Lips still pouting, and his Eyes unkind,
His Forehead too was rough as was his Mind;
His Color gone, and every pleasing Grace
Beset by fury had forsook his face:
Yet midst his passion, midst his frowns he moved,
As these were Charms He was the more beloved:
But when over come he could endure no more,
He came and wept before the hated door,
He wept and pined, he hung his sickly head,
The threshold kisst, and thus at last he said:
Ah cruel fair, and of a Tigress born!
Ah stony Boy, composed of frowns and scorn:
Unworthy of love, this Rope receive,
The last, and wellcomst Present I can give:
I Will never vex thee more, I Will cease to woe
And whether you condemned freely go,
Where certain Cures for Love, as Stories tell,
Where dismal shades, and dark Oblivion dwell:
Yet did I drink the whole forgetful Stream,
It would not drown my Love, nor quench my flame:
Thy cruel doors I bid my last Adieu,
Know what will come; and you shall find it true:
The Day is fair but quickly yields to shades,
The Lilly white, but when it is pluck it fades:
The Violet lovely, but it withers soon,
Youths beauty charming, but it is quickly gone:
The time shall come when you, proud Boy, shall prove
The heat of Passion, and the rage of Love:
Then shall thy Soul melt through thy weeping Eye,
Whilst all shall smile, and you unpitty'd dye.
Yet grant one kindness, and I ask no more,
When you shall see me hanging at the door
Do not go proudly by, forbear to smile,
But stay, sweet Boy, and gaze, and weep a while;
Then take me down, and whilst some tears are shed,
Thy own soft garment over my body spread,
And grant one Kiss, one Kiss when I am dead:
Nere fear, for you may safely grant me this,
^ shall not revive tho you could Love, and Kiss:
Then dig a Grave, there let my Love be laid,
And when you part, say thrice, my friend is dead,
Or else go farther on to please my Ghost,
And cry, my best, my dearest friend is lost:
And on my Monument inscribe this Rhyme,
The witness of my Love and of thy Crime,
This Shepherd died for Love, stay Stranger here,
And weep, and cry, He loved a cruel fair:
This said, he rolled a Stone, a mighty Stone,
Fate lent a hand behind, and pusht it on:
High by the Wall, on this he panting rose,
And tied, and sitted well the fatal noose:
Then from the place on which before he stood
He slipped, and hung the Door's unhappy load:
The Boy came forth, and with a scornful Meine
And smileing look beheld the tragic Scene;
Hang there said He, but O how I despise
So base, so mean a Trophy of my Eyes!
The proudest Kings should fall by my disdain,
Too noble to be lost upon a Swain:
This said, he turned, and as he turned his head
His Garments were polluted by the Dead,
Thence to the Plays and to the Baths did move,
The Bath was sacred to the God of Love;
For there he stood in comely Majesty
Smiles on his Cheeks, and softness in his Eye,
That part of the Marble wrought into his Breast
By Power divine was softer than the rest,
To show how Pity did exactly suit
With Love, and was his darling Atribute:
The God leapt forth, and dashed the Boy, the Wound
Let out his Soul, and as it fled He groaned.
Hail Lovers, hail, see here the scornful dies,
A just, and acceptable Sacrifice,
Be kind, and Love for mutual Love return,
For see the God takes vengeance on my scorn.
Idyllium XXIII.
Hercules in his Cradle kills two Serpents which Juno sent to destroy him etc.

To Mr. William Latton of Wadham College.
ALcides ten months old, a vigorous Child,
Alcmena fed, and laid him on a Shield,
(The Shield from Pterilus Amphitryo won
A great auspicious Cradle for his Son;)
With younger Iphiclus of human race,
No part of him was drawn from Jove's embrace:
On either head her tender hands she laid,
And with a Mother's fondness thus she said;
Sleep, sleep, dear Children, sleep, be free from pain,
Rest well to night, to morrow wake again:
This said she stopped, and rockt the sounding Shield,
Iphiclus wept, and young Alcides smiled:
Sleep seized on both: Now Mid-night's shade came on,
The flying Bear in have was tumbling down,
And broad Orion's Shoulder did appear
With His Sword, as still pursueing of the Bear;
When wily Juno full of envious hate
Drove on two dreadful Serpents to the Gate,
She forced the Doors, and showed the Open way
Designing young Alcides For their prey:
Their Scaly trains rolled over the trembling floor,
Their fiery Eyes shot sulphurous flames before,
And from their Jaws dropped clods of Putrid gore:
When near they rolled, and did the Infants touch,
Even Sleep it self straight fled at their approach,
The Children wak't, and, by Jove's order, light
Shot through the gloomy darkness of the Night:
Iphiclus cried as soon as he beheld
The Snakes twist round, and gapeing over the Shield,
He kicked the Clothes, and tossed, for flight prepared,
As if he meant to shun the Fate he feared:
But young Alcides stretched his Infant hands,
And graspt the rolling Snakes with fatal bands,
He seized their swelling throats, where stored by Fate
Their Poison lies, which even the Gods do hate:
In that Death dips her darts, then takes her rounds,
And on frail Mortals scatters certain wounds:
Each twisted round the Babe a dreadful fold,
But still he graspt, and took the firmer hold,
The Babe, not weaned as yet, in Mind a Man,
He showed his Race as soon as he began:
In's Nurses Arms he never was heard to cry,
No tear e're dropped from his unwilling Eye:
At last tired out they both extended lay,
The Infants spoil, his first auspicious prey:
Alcmena's Ears first heard the tender cries,
She started first, and said Amphytrio, rise;
Rise, rise, thy aid a sudden danger calls,
Do hear how loud the younger Infant bawls?
Do see these Walls shine with unusual light,
For yet the Morning has not chac't the Night;
There Is some strange thing, there is, Rise, rise my Dear,
From Danger free thy Babes, thy Wife from Fear:
She spoke, Amphitryo rose, such have he showed
As nimble Lightning from a breaking Cloud,
He snatched his Sword, which over his valiant head
Hung allways fastened to the Cedar bed,
A strong Belt held it, tough, and neatly made,
He graspt the Sheath, and drew the flameing Blade;
When straight the light withdrew its wondrous rays,
In darkness left him; and in wild amaze:
Still startled more, Lights Slaves, Slaves Lights, he cries,
Lights Slaves, deep sleep sat heavy on their Eyes:
Lights Maids, They heard, and quick as the command,
A flameing Torch now shone in every hand,
They all rush in; with troubled have they come,
And buisy throngs straight fill the crowded Room:
But when they saw two Snakes twist round the Child
They shreikt, and wept; the young Alcides smiled:
Held out the Snakes, pleased with the gilded sight,
Laughed at his own success, and their affright;
Disdained those Foes that with such ease He slew,
And at his Fathers feet the Monsters threw:
Half dead Iphiclus on her tender breast
Alcmena clapped, and lulled him into rest:
The other Babe on Skins of slaughtered sheep
Amphitryo laid, and then returned to sleep;
When thrice the Cock had Crow'd to wake the Sun,
Alcmena starting from her Bed of Down
Tiresias called, from whom Truth always fell,
Scarce Phoebus knew the mind of Fate so well:
She told the tale, and said, thrice reverend Seer
Explain the meaning, IN me prepared to hear:
Nor yet to pleasure me conceal the doom,
Or bad or good, what Fate has wove must come:
Thus spoke the Queen, and thrice his reverend Head
Tiresias shook, and thus at last he said:
Hail mighty Queen, the pride of Person's blood,
Happy, and Mother of a future God:
The time shall come as years bring round the days,
When Grecian Maids shall sing Alcmena's praise,
And as they weave, or whirl their Spindle round
From every tongue Alcmena's name shall sound;
The Grecians goddess thou shall grace a shrine,
So great thy Son shall be, and so divine!
A generous Hero he shall mount on high,
The noblest burden of the bending Sky:
To Him all Monsters, and all Men must yield,
The Tyrant's Scourge, and the Oppressed's Shield*
Twelve labors passed he shall the Skies enjoy,
When Oeta's flames have purged the base alloy:
Be called their Son in Law, appease their Hate
Who raised these Snakes, and sent them to his Fate.
Then Woolves shall see young Fawns approach their Den,
And let them part unhurt, and safe again,
So great a Scourge he shall to Monsters prove,
And shed such Influence from his Seat above:
But Queen observe, and let a Pile be made,
Green Oaks, and Ash, and Birch in order laid:
Then cut these Snakes, observe the time they came
To eat the Babe, and burn them over the flame:
At morning peep soon quench the blazeing wood,
And scatter all the Ashes over the flood,
And thence return, but with a steady pace,
Nor look behind on the polluted place:
Then let pure Brimstone purge the Rooms, and bring
Clear Fountain water from the sweetest Spring;
This mixed with Salt, with blooming Olives crowned,
Spread over the Floor, and purge polluted ground:
Then kill a Bore to Jove, that free from harms
The Child may live, and Victory crown his Arms.
This said, he bowed, and with a staggering gate
For years oppress't him, reached his Ivory Seat.
And now the Boy, his Mother's pride, was grown
Like riseing Oaks, and thought Amphitryo's Son:
In Letter's Linus did his Mind enlarge,
A generous Hero, watchful of his charge:
Eumolpus tuned his manly voice to sing,
And taught his hand to strike the tuneful string:
Eurytus famous for his vast Estate
To draw the Bow, and shoot as sure as Fate:
To Leap, to Wrestle and to throw the Dart
He learned from fierce Autolycus's Art,
Sweet Herme's Son who when he fought his Foe
None dared, tho distant, to behold his Brow:
Such frightful fierceness did in's looks appear
And shot through the amazed Spectators fear:
To drive the Chariot, and with steady skill
To turn, and yet not break the bending Wheel
Amphitryo kindly did instruct his Son;
Great in that Art, for he himself had won
Vast precious prizes on the Argive Plains,
And still the Chariot, which he drove, remains,
For naught but eating Time could break his Reins;
To weild his Sword, and to assault his Foe,
To use his Shield, and shun the comeing blow,
To order Battles, and to raise their force,
Close Ambush lay, and lead the furious Horse,
Stout Castor taught, when he from Argos fled,
Basely deserted by the force he led,
When Tydeus Arms the fatal Conquest won,
And forced the weak Adrastus from his Throne:
Few of the Heroes equaled him in Fight
E're trembling Age had put strong Youth to flight:
Thus grew the Boy his Mother's care and pride,
His bed was raised by his great Father's side,
Spread with a Lion's Skin, whose Jaws affright
The weaker Youths, but were this Boys delight:
When young he often would unsheath their Paws,
And use his tender Hands to break their Jaws;
And when one Tooth was broke, with smiles would meet,
And cast his Trophies at his Mother's feet:
His food was roasted flesh, his loaf was great,
As large as even a laboring Swain could eat:
A spareing Meal, and unprepared at night,
His Clothes were made for covering, not delight:
Thus hardly bred the mighty Hero grew,
Well fitted for the wonders He must do.
Imperfect in the Greek. Idyllium XXIV.
A Dialogue between Daphnis and a Shepherdess.

To Thomas Powel of Wadh. Col. Esquire.
D. PAris a Herdsman Helen stole, it is said,
And she that kisst me is as fair a Maid:

S. Pride not thy self, what empty thing's a Kiss!


D. And yet that empty thing is full of Bliss;


S. I wash my mouth, and thus thy Kiss disdain;


D. Do wash my Dear? then come, let us Kiss again:


S. Swain thou should kiss thy Heifer, not a Maid:


D. Don't scorn, thy youth, like dreams, will quickly fade,


S. The Grape, when dry, grows Raisin, and is prized.
Nor is the Rose, tho withered, soon despised:

D. Come to these Shades, I Have tales never told before


S. Once your sweet tongue deceived, I Will trust no more.


D. Go with me to those Elms, and here my Flute,


S. Go please thy self, I hate so harsh a note:


D. Let fear of Venus anger seize thy mind,


S. A fig for Venus, if Diana's kind;


D. Ah speak not thus lest she should fix her Chain,
The noose is strong, and you may strive invain.

S. Ay, let her do it, I live Diana's care,
And she shall quickly free me from her Snare,
Hands off Rude Swain, I vow I Will scratch, forbear,

D. You must not escape, no Maid e're escaped Loves stroke,


S. I Will escape, by Pan, but thou shallt bear his Yoke;


D. To meaner Swains I fear you will be kind,


S. Many have wooed, none yet e're pleased my Mind:


D. And I am one that woo, and would obtain:


S. What shall I do? Marriage is full of pain,


D. Not grief and pain, but Joy attends the Bed;


S. Sure I have heard that Wives their Husbands dread:


D. No, no, they rule, for what should Weomen fear?


S. Childbirth is hard, and I Am afraid to bear:


D. No fear, over that thy own Diana reigns,
And gives a speedy ease to Mother's pains:

S. Yet I Am afraid, should many Births prevail
My Beauty fades, and then your Love may fail:

D. Yet should you bear fine Boys, a Happy Wife,
How would you look into a future Life!

S. But come, what Jointure, Swain, if I should yield;


D. My Flocks, my Herds, my Woods, and all my Field:


S. Swear then, lest when enjoyed you false should prove,


D. Never by Pan, if you will consent to Love:


S. Will you a Bed, a House, and Meat provide?


D. All this shall be the Dowry of my Bride?
Look, all these Flocks are mine, I Will still be true,
And promise you no more than I can do:

S. What shall I say when my old Friends shall blame?


D. They Will like the Marriage when they hear my name:


S. Then tell thy name, for names do often please,


D: Daphnis, my Father's joy, and Mother's ease;
His name is Lycidas the noble Swain,
Here Is Neme, once the Beauty of the Plain:

S. Thy race is noble, but yet mine is as good,


D. But no ways better, for in yonder Wood
Menalcas lives, the Fountain of thy Blood.

S. Show me thy Grove, and where thy Sheep-Coat lies:


D. These are my Trees, look how my Cypress rise;


S. Feed Goats, whilst I attend the Herdman's Love,


D. Feed Bulls, I go to show the Maid my Grove:


S. Rude Swain, what means your hand upon my breast?


D. The Cluster's ripe, and sueing to be presst:
Those I must pluck; oh! with what Heat they move!
And how they rise at every touch of Love!

S. I quake, pull out your hand, rude Swain, forbear;


D. Cheer up, no harm, how timorous is my Dear!


S. It Is Dirty, ah! look there, twill stain my Gown,
And tell my jealous friends what I have done:

D. I Will spread my Jerkin, it is a scurvy place
But ^'me content to pay for the embrace:

S. Forbear, we shall be caught, I hear a noise,


D. It Is naught but Trees that murmur at our joys;


S. You^ tear my Coat, ah me, I am undone.


D. I Will buy a larger, and a better Gown:


S. You promise all things now, but, when enjoyed,
What willt thou give? Love's gone when Lust is cloyed:
You will deceive, you Men are all deceit,
And we so willing to believe the cheat:

D. O, could I give my Soul, what Oaths can do
I Will bind; I must, I cannot but be true:

S. I yield, forgive Diana, O forgive,
I lived thy Votary, but no more can live:

D. Pleased, Ravished, O, I Will kill in yonder Grove
A Steer to Venus; and a Bull to Love:

S. I Am Woman grown that was a Maid before,


D. A teeming Woman, and a Maid no more:
Thus murmuring they did their soft Heats improve,
And went, and knew the Mystery of Love:
She rose, and smiled, and banis^t Modesty
Regained her Seat, and sat upon her Eye:
Yet secret Pleasure through her looks appeared;
And joyful Daphnis went, and fed his Herd.

Idyllium XXV.
A short account of the Death of Pentheus the Theban King, whom his Mother and
Aunts tore in Pieces for disturbing the Solemnities of Bacchus.

To Mr. Dring of Wadh. Col.
I NO, the fierce Autonoe, and the fair
Agau three Thyrsi to the Hills did bear,
In number Three; they plucked wild Oaks and Bays,
And in plain Fields did twelve green Altars raise;
With Ivy shaded, and adorned with Vine,
Fair Semele had Three, and Bacchus Nine,
Bacchus the Weomen's God, and Men's delight,
These take at Day, and those receive at Night:
From Baskets then those sacred gifts they made
They gladly took, and on the Altar laid,
Mysterious gifts, to please the wondrous God,
And Honor him the way that he had showed:
Young Pentheus lay in shady Hills concealed,
And from the Rock the wondrous rites beheld,
Autonoe spied him first, and cried aloud,
See their the great Contemner of the God;
And out she ran, and as she went o'rethrew
The sacred rites, which no profane must view:
She first grew mad, then all the rest were fired,
Their Fury rose as High as Rage inspired:
Young Pentheus fled when he their madness viewed,
They tuckt their Coats and eagerly pursued:
He cried, what mean the Weomen? Oh forbear!
Wretch you shall feel, they answered, e're you hear:
His Mother seized, and snatched his Head away,
And roared, as a fierce Tigress over her prey,
Ino stamped on his Breast, his Arm she tore,
And fierce Autonoe reekt with royal gore:
Others seized other Limbs, each snatched a part,
And every hand reached forward to his heart:
This done they shouted, and ran madly down,
And bore the bloody Trophies to the Town:
Deserved: Let none his Mighty Power offend,
Lest greater mischiefs, and vast pains attend,
Let me be good, Let me the just approve,
For this is pleasing, and the care of Jove:
For Pious Fathers on their Sons derive
Sure blessings, which the Impious cannot give;
They live themselves still vexed with sharp remorse,
And leave a long Hereditary Curse:
Hail Bacchus Hail, whom snatched from Destiny
Great Jove secured, and fostered in his Thigh:
Hail Semele, and all his Sisters hail,
Whose fame resounds through every Grecian vale:
Their Act was just that did reward the Sin,
They showd the Votary, and put off the Kin:
Take heed Profane, by this Example showd,
For what the Gods inspire must needs be good.
Idyllium XXVI.
An advice to a Friend to be constant in his Love.

To Charles Viner of Wadham College, Esquire.
WIne, Friend, and Truth, the Proverb says, agree,
And now I Am heated take this Truth from me;
The Secrets that lay deep and hid before
Now raised by Wine swim up, and bubble over;
Then take this riseing Truth I ca'nt control,
Thou do not Love Me, Youth, with all thy Soul;
I know it, for this half of Life I boast
I have from you, the other half is lost:
When e're you smile I rival Gods above,
Grown perfect, and exalted by thy Love;
But when you frown, and when dislike you show,
I sink to Hell, more cursed than all below;
Yet how can this with common sense agree
To torture one that loves, and dies for Thee?
But Youth, could my Advice thy thoughts engage,
Mine who have learned Experience by my Age,
The Counsell's good, and when a numerous store
Of Blessings Crown Thee, Thou will praise me more:
On one Tree build one Nest, and build it strong,
Where no fierce Snake can creep, and seize thy young:
Now here you stand, and suddenly are gone,
You leap from Bough to Bough, and fix on none.
If any views thy Beauty, and Commends,
You straight enroll him midst your ancient friends,
Whilst all your old Acquaintance laid aside,
Dear youth this smells of Vanity and Pride:
Love One, your Equal, love whilst Life remains,
This pleases all, and Commendation gains,
By this your Passion will but light appear
Which conquers all, and all are forced to bear;
Love seizes all; and does all Minds control,
It melts the stubborn temper of my Soul;
But O I must embrace, Dear, grant one Kiss,
And thus reward, and practice my Advice.
Idyllium XXVII.
The Bore that killed Adonis is brought before Venus.

To William Kenrick of Wadham College, Esquire.
WHen Venus saw Adonis dead,
His Cheeks all pale, and beauty fled,
His Hair grown stiff with clotted gore,
And now to be beloved no more,
She bad her Cupids trace the Grove,
And bring the Bore that killed her Love:
They, quick as the Command, ran over
The Wood, and found the hated Bore,
They seized, and bound, strong Cords they twined,
Some drew before, some drove behind,
One twirld his Tail to make him go,
Another lasht him with his Bow:
The fearful Beast went trembling on,
As conscious of the deed he done,
His hanging looks his guilt betrayed
Of Venus Fury much afraid:
When come, Her rage these words expressed:
Thou vilest Monster of a Beast,
Were these the cruel Tusks did tear?
Wast Thou the ruin of my Dear?
The Bore, replied, By thee, thy Love,
By All that is kind, and apt to move,
By what I suffer, by these chains,
And these that drive me to my pains,
I never had a design to kill
Thy Fair, it was against my Will:
But when I saw his naked Thigh
As white as polisht Ivory,
How did my Flame and Fury rise!
How was I fired at the surprise!
At last unable to resist
Ah me! too furiously I kisst,
And this the Boys destruction brought,
And Love betrayed me to a fault:
These Tusks destroy, and punish these
The cursed disturbers of thy ease,
For why should I have leave to prove
These Tusks that have no use in Love:
Or if the crime demands no less
These Lips I offer to appease:
These words so moveingly expressed
Calmed all the Fury of her Breast,
She soon forgave, releast her Foe,
And bad her Cupids let him go,
But he never sought Woods again,
But staid attending on her train;
And to the Funeral Pile he came,
And burnt his Tusks in the devouring flame.
Idyllium XXVIII.
He presents a Distaff to Theeugnis his Friend Nicias his Wife.

To Mr. Charles Whiteing of Wadham College.
DIstaff, thou greatest gift on Man bestowed
By fair Minerva as the chiefest good,
Whom wise and thrifty Weomen still retain,
And raise their Husband's fortune by their pain,
Retire with me to Nileu's beauteous Town,
Where stately shrines grace Venus and her Son,
For thither, Distaff, I am now designed,
And beg of mighty Jove a prosperous wind,
To be enjoyed by, and enjoy my Friend:
Nicias, in whom the sweet tongued Graces rest,
Learning it self is seated in his Breast,
There thou of polisht Ivory framed shall prove,
A grateful present to his dearest Love;
From thee shall all her Husband's Vests be spun,
From thee She Will often draw a flowery Gown;
For Lambs do loose their Fleeces twice a year
To fill her Baskets, and be wrought by her:
So painful is Theeugnis, what the wise
And thrifty Matrons value, She will prize:
Nor would I send thee to an idle place
Thou product of our Country, and our grace;
For thou were made where Walls stout Archias framed,
The Pride of Sicily, for valor famed:
Now thou shall visit him whose wondrous skill
Can save the Men that Fate designs to kill,
Whose Herbs can soon restore a life when lost,
And by his Art bring back the flying Ghost:
That fair Theeugnis may by all be known
To have the neatest Distaff in the Town;
And still of me her friend kind thoughts infuse,
Of me the chiefest Darling of the Muse:
There some shall see thee, and these words repeat,
The present's small, but yet the kindness great,
The Giver's Love does little Gifts commend,
And every thing is valued from a Friend.
Idyllium XXIX.
Hercules going to Augias meets a Herdsman, of whom he asks the usual questions
which a Stranger makes, and receives satisfaction: and is afterward brought to
the King and his Son Phyleus, who were then in the Fields; By those he is
invited to the Town, and in the way tells Phyleus how he had killed the Nemean
Lion.

To Mr. Thomas Piggot of Wadham College.
Imperfect in the Greek. AND then the Herdsman, from his laboring hand
He threw his work, thus answered his demand:
I Will gladly tell what e're thy mind desires,
This Justice craves, and Mercury requires;
For he of all the Gods resents it most,
When we deny a Stranger what is just:
Look, Stranger, all the numerous Herds around
With which the Vales are filled, and Hills are crowned,
King Augias owns; over thousand Plains they spread,
In different Meads, and various Pastures fed,
Some on the flowery Banks of Eli stray,
And some where smooth Alpheus eats his way;
Some midst the Vines in fair Boupraisium go,
Some here, the Valleys tremble when they Low:
For each of these the King fair Stalls has reared,
Tho numerous, large, and equal to the Herd:
And here fresh Grass still clothes the fruitful Plain,
The Blades, as soon as cropped, arise again,
For Springs cut through the Plain, and feed the Grass,
All fit to fatten Oxen, and increase:
Look, on thy right hand far beyond the Flood
The Stall appears between the shady Wood,
Next where wild Olives, and high Planes do grow;
Apollo's shrine, to whom the Herdsmen bow,
And own the greatest Deity below.
Next are the Farmer's Stalls, whose Labors bring
Whole Streams of gain, and much enrich the King,
For thrice they Plow, thrice sow the teeming soil,
Which still invites, and still rewards their toil:
Many large Vineyards plant, his Vines they dress*
And sweaty Autum treads the flowing Press:
For all these Gardens, Feilds, and Plains around
Till yonder watery Hills the compass bound,
King Augias owns, and here all day we bear
The Heat and Cold, and urge the weighty share:
But Sir, (for I no common Aaid may prove)
What Buisness led you to this happy Grove,
Would you the King, or any Servant See,
I can direct you, you shall learn from Me:
For sure you seem, if well I make your face,
Great in your self, and noble in your race;
How brave you look! and what a Port you bear!
So look the Sons of Gods when they appear:
This said he bowed, and Jove's stout Son replied,
Swain, Generous, free from Savageness or Pride,
I seek the King whom all these Realms obey,
Buisness with him first drew my Feet this way,
If midst his Subjects now he keeps the Town,
Divideing Justice from his equal Throne,
Give me a Swain to guide, a Master Swain,
Who when I ask can answer me again,
For Man is made to be a help to Man:
Thus spoke Alcides, Thus the Swain replied,
Sir, all the way some God your feet must guide,
So luckily things happen, so conspire
To please your Mind, and answer your desire:
Last night King Augias and his valiant Son
Young Phyleus left the hurry of the Town,
They came to spend some days midst peaceful Swains,
And view their wondrous riches on the Plains,
This Pains some Princes take, they leave their ease,
For when they watch themselves their Stores increase:
When with Heaven's Providence they join their own,
A double guard secures their safer Throne,
But come, let us go, and both the Prince attend,
In yonder Stall, He Will love so great a Friend:
This said he hastened to conduct his guest,
His wonder still at every step encreast;
His Lions Skin, vast Club, his Mein and Face
Still hightned, still he wondered what he was;
Often he would ask, but yet as often represt
The riseing Query in his troubled Breast,
Lest it should seem too rude, and ill designed,
For, O, it is hard to know another's Mind!
Whilst yet far off the faithful Mastiffs knew
The noise and smell of both, and out they flew:
From every part they at the Hero run
With open mouths, resolved to tear him down:
But round the Swain they wagg'd their tails, and played;
And in hoarse murmurs savage joy betrayed:
He stoopt to take up stones, they stopped their noise,
He spoke, they feared the thunder of his voice:
All silent fled, but yet the Swain was glad
To see his Mastiffs care, and thus he said:
What useful Creatures are these Dogs to Man!
How full of care! how useful to a Swain!
Had they but reason to know whom to tear,
And whom to love, what Creature could compare!
But now they are Brutish, then he cried, begone;
Each took his Stall* and lay in quiet down:
Now down the West with a descending ray
Bright Phoebus drove, and bore declineing day:
Now shades drew on, and full of Milk and food;
The Sheep came home, and lay and chewd the Cud:
Next these the Cows and Oxen filled the Plain,
As thick as Clouds when Jove descends in rain:
When watery Southwinds bring their Treasures forth,
Or when They Are hudled by the stormy North:
No man can count them, for so fast they rise,
And follow one another through the Skies,
Still new and new the driveing tempest brings,
And bears vast burdens on his weary Wings:
These Herds a Herdsman drove, the fields, and road
Were (...) the valleys sounded when they lowed:
The Sta^^^ were crowded, and could scarce contain,
And S^^^p lay round, and bleated over the Plain:
The ^^ousand Slaves stood round of every kind,
No^e wanted work, all had their Tasks assigned:
One shackled starting Cows, and whilst they stood
He milk'd, and straight the largest Pail o'reflow'd:
One let the Calves to suck, they soon were filled
With sweetest Milk, such stores the Cows did yield:
Some bore the Pails, and some did run the Cheese
Hot from the Cow, some raised the Wring to squeeze,
And some the Bulls apart from Heifers drove,
They turned and bellowed, eager on their Love:
The King himself went round to every Herd,
To see what Calves his Servants Care had reared:
And whilst through his vast Stores he traced the Plain,
His Son and great Alcides made his train;
Here tho our Hero's Soul great Shows despised,
Was constant, fixed, too brave to be surpised,
Yet now at last his wonder rose to view,
Such numerous Herds, and scarce could think 'twas true,
That One such stores should have, that could suffice
Ten Kings, and fill capacious Avarice:
But this was a peculiar favor shown,
A Blessing sent by Phoebus on his Son,
His Cattle still must thrive, his Herds be blessed,
And Heaven secured what e're the King possessed:
His Cows never cast their Calves, and no disease,
The Herdsman's plague, was e're allowed to seize:
From year to year the numerous Herd encreast
New Calves were reared, and still the last were best,
Three hundred Bulls, turned Horns grace every head,
Their legs were white, with these two hundred red,
All leapt the Cows, begot a numerous race,
And soon supplied frail Nature's chance-decays,
Apart from these twelve mighty Bulls did run,
As white as Snow, and sacred to the Sun;
Each with his shape might tempt the Tyrian Queen,
They fed, were pleased, and wantoned over the Green:
And when fierce Lions from the Woods appeared
They turned to fight, and still secured the Herd,
They bellowed lowed, they tore the trembling ground,
And with bent foreheads aimed a double wound:
Midst these one Bull did far e^cel the rest,
Called Phaeton, a stout and mighty Beast
This name the Herdsman gave deduc't from light,
For his quick Courage, and his strength in fight;
He all excelled, was stately, valiant, fair,
As much as Phaeton the meanest Star:
The Lion's Skin, that over the Hero spread
As soon as first he saw, he bent his head,
And ran to push, he quickly shunned the wound,
His left Horn grasp't, and pulled him to the ground,
Invain he strove, invain he spurned the Sand,
With doubled strength the Hero fixed his hand,
Then urged his breast, and forced the Bull to rear
On high, and held him Beating in the Air:
The King, his valiant Son, and all the Plain
Admired his strength, and thought him more than Man:
The Prince and Hero now dark shades grew on,
The Meadows left, and hastened to the Town:
They took a path which from the distant Stall
Through Vine-yards led, and through a pleasing vale,
It Was little beaten, through a shady Grove
A soft and cool retreat for happy Love,
No heavy Clowns came there whose weighty tread
Might spoil the verdure of the grassy bed:
And as they walked with a Majestic look
Young Phyleus turned his head, and thus he spoke:
Sir, if I guess aright, your sounding Fame
Has reached my Ears, tho 't has not told your name,
For one an Argive, valiant, stout and young
From Aelis came, and pleased the listening throng
He said, whilst he was there, and vowed 'twas true,
A valiant Greek a furious Lion slew,
Strong, cruel, bloody, that destroyed the Swains,
The fierce Nemean Terror of the Plains;
But whether Argos his great Birth could boast
Or Sparta gave, my Memory has lost;
But yet he said, tho I forget the place,
For that I mind, he was of Perseus race;
You, Sir, I hope are he, the man that fought,
This Skin proclaims as much, and clears my doubt:
But pray inform me, 'twill afford delight
And please me much if I conjecture right,
Tell me if you are he, the brave, the bold,
Of whom the Argive's wondrous tale was told;
Tell how the Lion fell, what strokes he stood,
And how he came to the Nemean Wood,
For did you seek it, you would seek invain
For such a Monster on the Grecian Plain,
She breeds no such, the Bear, the Woolf, and Bore,
Unlucky Beasts, she breeds, and breeds no more;
Hence some admire, and some the tale accuse
As if contrived to please, and to amuse:
This said he bowed, and stepped aside to show
The Path was large, and wide enough for two;
He begged the Hero to advance more near,
That they might speak with greater ease, and hear,
He soon came forward, and whilst side by side
They walked, he to his question thus replied
Brave Augias Son, what e're the Prince has said
Is right, and his conjecture duly weighed,
Yet I Will inform you how the Monster fell,
And whence it came, for very few can tell;
But most imagine 'twas design'dly sent
To prove the base Pheroneans punishment,
Neglect of Duty had provokt a God:
The poor Piseans like a headlong flood
He ravaged over and drowned their Fields in Blood:
But most the Bembinaeans felt his rage,
And lingered out a miserable Age,
This task Eurystheus, whom I must obey,
Imposed, and hoped to see me prove the Lion's prey:
I took my Bow, my Hollow Quiver bore
Sharp Arrows armed with the Lernean gore,
When e're I draw a shaft Deaths wait around
To guide the Dart, and enter at the wound:
My left hand graspt my Club, strong, knotty, rude,
With all its Bark, unpolisht from the Wood;
It grew on Helicon, I plucked it thence
With Roots and all, and weild for my Defense:
Approaching to the Wood, I bent my Bow,
My Arrow knocked, and wished to meet my Foe,
I looked around, and tried, prepared for fight,
To spy the Beast, and take advantage of the sight,
'Twas midday now, and yet no Beast appeared,
No track was seen, nor any roaring heard,
No Herdsman, Swain, that might his Den declare,
All lay at home chained up with slavish fear:
But still I trac't the Groves, through Woods I pressed,
Resolved at last to find and fight the Beast:
For every Evening glutted with the Blood
Of slaughtered Beasts he took the shady Wood;
His Maine was stiff with gore, his grisly Beard
His long Tongue lickt with Blood and foam besmeared;
Behind a Thicket I impatient lay
And wished each Minute was the Close of day,
That I might see him; Lo at last he came,
In look as dreadful as he was in fame;
I drew my Bow, and shot, the String did sound,
And Death stood ready to attend the wound,
But from his side the Shaft rebounding fell,
And proved the hardened Beast was armed too well:
The Lion roared, he raised his furious Head
And looked to see from whence the Arrow fled,
His flameing Eyes shot Fire, unsheathed his Paws,
He gap't, and Teeth looked dreadful in his Jaws:
I knocked another Arrow, drew again,
Enraged to see the former shot invain:
The Breast it struck where Life maintains her Seat,
And laboring Lungs still fan the vital Heat:
But that invain did from his Breast rebound,
And raised his Fury only, not a wound:
A third I drew, but e're I aimed aright;
The Beast perceived me, and prepared for fight:
His Tail twirl'd round, his Neck was swollen with Rage,
And every Limb seemed eager to engage,
His Mane stood up, his fiery Eyes did glow,
And Crooked Back was bent into a Bow:
And as when Wheelers take a sturdy Oak,
Or Elm, and Bath it in the glowing smoke,
To make a Wheel, at first it bends, and stands
And then at once leaps from their grasping Hands:
So leapt the Beast at me, such Springs as these
He made, grown eager and resolved to seize:
But I received him, in my left I held
My Darts, and a thick garment was my Shield,
My Right did weild my Club, and aimed a Blow,
As He was leaping forward, at his Brow,
A lucky blow, but on the hardened bones
It broke, the Lion sighed in hollow groans;
Some steps retired, as if all Sense was sled,
And stood with shakeing Legs, and dizzy'd head:
Mists seized his Eyes, and an amazeing pain
Ran through the crazy Vessels of his Brain:
This I observed, and now an easy prey
I threw my Quiver and my shafts away
And seized his Neck; and whilst his Sense was gone
I gripped him hard, and kept the Lion down;
My G^^pes d^^bled, and ^ehind I pressed,
Lest (...) ^aws should tear my adverse Breast,
On's h^nde^ (...) I (...), and squeezed his Thighs
With mine, (...) spurned invain and strove to rise:
At last overcome when he (...) strove invain
He lay extended o^ the ^a^al Plain,
I held him breathless, did his force control,
And gapeing Hell received his mighty Soul:
Then next I sought how I might gain the Spoils,
And with his precious Skin reward my toyls;
The task was hard, for neither Wood, nor Stone,
Nor Steel could pierce, and make the Skin my own:
But then some God did happy thoughts infuse,
The Paws he showed, and taught me those to use:
I did, and flead him, and the Hide I bear
To be my strong security in War:
Thus fell the Beast by which such numbers fell,
And fled amidst his slaughtered Heaps to Hell.
Idyllium XXX.
The Fight between Amycus and Pollux: This Amycus being excellently well
skilled at Whirlebats, made a Decree that whatever Stranger came into his
Country should fight with him; after he had slain a great many, Pollux at last
overcomes him.

To Mr. Robert D' oily of Wadham College.
FAir Leda's Sons and mighty Jove's I sing
Castor and Pollux Glories of the Ring,
None toss their Whirlebats with so brave a force,
None guide so well the Fury of their Horse,
With trebled Songs I sing the glorious Two,
The great supports and helps of Man below,
When midst destructive Wars swift dangers press,
Or stormy Stars send Tempests over the Seas;
They toss the Floods, and raise the swelling Tide
At Poop or Prow, and dash on either side,
Or pour into the Ship, the Planks and Masts
Are torn, nor can the Sails endure the Blasts,
But rent hang useless; Storms of Hail and Rain
From Heaven descend, and beat the Spacious Main:
The Waters roar, the Troubled Ocean raves
Whilst Hail and Stormy Winds do beat the Waves
Yet then you draw the Ship from deepest Seas,
And those that looked for Death are cheered with ease;
The Clouds all fly and Storms strickt silence keep,
And a smooth Calmness spreads over all the Deep:
Bright Stars appear, and with a beauteous ray
Presage good voyages, and show the way:
Great helps to Man, of Both my Muse must write
Both skilled in Horses, singing, and in fight,
But Muse, whose Praises must I first rehearse?
Sing Both, first Pollux grace thy sounding Verse:
When Argo's Sails had escaped the closeing Shores,
And swept cold Pontus with her nimble Oars,
She touched Bebryca, forced by prosperous fate,
The Sons of Gods and Heroes were her freight:
And there they landed; when they came to land
Some raised Grass-beds, and by their Lords command
Some dressed their Meat upon the naked Sand:
Castor and Pollux weary of the Floods
Left all their Mates, and traced the shady Woods:
And as they gazed, beneath a gloomy Cave
They saw a Spring roll on a purling wave,
Like Silver pure, and round on every part
Contrived by prudent Nature's happy art
Small Fountains flowed, and bubled over the Grass,
As clear as Crystal, and as smooth as Glass:
Tall Firs and Planes, and Cypress shade the Streams,
Defending from the Fury of the Beams,
The Banks were crowned with Flowers, which Nature brings
For Bees, and to embalm the dying Springs:
By this a Man in shineing Armor sat,
Frightful his look, and terrible as Fate:
His Face was full of Knubs, how large his Chest?
His Shoulders broad and equal to his Breast:
His Flesh like Brass, more hard the more he fought,
Like a Colossus on an Anvil wrought:
And as tall Rocks that have long time withstood
The numerous whirlings of a rapid Flood,
At last grow round, but yet unconquered stand,
So looked the swelling Muscles on his hand;
And over his Shoulders hung a Lion's Skin
Claspt by the golden Paws beneath his Chin;
With some surprise and wonder in his look
Brave Pollux viewed him, and at last he spoke:
P. Health Sir, what Nations plough this happy shore?


A. How health, when I see men never seen before?


P. Fear not, we are honest, and no danger's near;


A. I do not, nor need you bid me not fear:


P. Your Answer's rude, your manners are untame,


A. What Is that? Sir, as you see me, such I am:
But what have you to do to tread these shores,
Did e're I come to trouble you on yours?

P. Sir if you did you should be entertained,
Be graced with gifts, and treated as a friend:

A. Talk not of Presents thus, thy gifts I scorn,
Nor have I any ready to return:

P. May I not taste the Streams that idly flow?


A. If Thirst has scorcht thy Bowels thou shall know:


P. Here Is Gold, I Will give you any price to gain:


A. Then you must fight a single Man to Man:
Set foot to foot, and steady Eyes advance,
And use your greatest skill, nor trust to Chance:

P. Whom must I fight with? must I beat the Air?


A. Thy match is ready, and thy equal near:


P. And what is the prize? what must the Conqueror have?


A. The conquered, Sir, shall be the Conquerors Slave:


P. This is Cock's sport, not fit for generous Men,
Where the dull Dastard leaves the Cackling Hen:

A. Or Cock's or Lion's, I Am resolved on this:
I than my self can stake no worthier prize:
This said, Amycus, did his Trumpet sound,
The Valleys rung, and echoed all around,
Through every distant Field the noise was heard,
And Crowds of stout Bebrycians soon appeared:
Whilst from the Ship the thronging Heroes press,
To view the Fight and judge of the Success,
Now were their Whirlbats bound, rough Thongs embraced
Their knotty Arms, and tied their Weapons fast:
Out they advanced, and each with Fury shook,
They breathed Defiance, Terror in their look:
Here was a noble strife of Art begun
Who on his Back should gain the setting Sun,
And Pollux gained it, the descending Rays
Shone full in mighty Amycus's Face:
Enraged at this his headlong Fury ro^e,
And he rusht on, and doubled all his blows,
But Pollux soust his Cheek, it flowed with gore,
He saw his Blood, and then he raged the more:
The Fight grew hotter, like a mighty Oak
He backward bent to take the greater stroke,
Shouts the Bebrycians gave, and raised his Heat,
The Heroes cheered stout Pollux with as great;
For they all feared lest forced to narrow streights
Pollux should fall beneath the threatened weights:
But he with dextrous skill and watchful Art
Still shunned the strokes, secure on every part,
He plied him hard, and did his force control,
Tho great his Courage, furious was his Soul:
Doz'd with the strokes the nodding Hero stood,
And from his Mouth flowed Streams of clotted Blood*
The Grecians shouted when they viewed the blows,
And saw his broken Cheeks, and battered Nose,
His Eyes contracted in his swelling Face,
And by their shoutings doubled the disgrace:
The Prince still eager pressed, he plied him hard,
And with false strokes soon beat him from his guard,
And, when he saw him staggering, aimed a blow,
The stroke was sure, and smote his haughty Brow,
The Ball returned as from a hardened Stone,
But tore the Flesh, and left the naked Bone:
Over come by this and yielding to the wound
The Hero fell, and bit the bloody ground;
But rose, and then a fiercer Fight began,
Enraged by his Disgrace, and by his pain:
Both tossed their Whirlbats, and vast wounds bestowed,
With Blood and Sweat their laboring Bodies flowed:
Stout Amycus still aimed at Hands and Breast,
And with redoubled force he bravely pressed,
But wiser Pollux every fatal blow
Aimed at his Head, and crazed his nodding Brow:
His limbs grew less, his color turned to pale,
And from a mighty Giant shrunk to small,
But Pollux seemed to grow, he looked more great,
His color better, and increast by Heat;
But Muse, how Pollux did the Hero quell
What stroke he gave, explain, for you can tell,
I sing as you direct, your voice obey,
And gladly follow, when you lead the way:
Designing now to push the Combat on
He seized on Pollux left hand with his own,
Bending to shun the stroke, and closeing nigh
Reached out his right, and graspt his Brawny Thigh:
But he his body bowed, and broke the Lock,
And at his Temple aimed a fatal stroke,
Just where the vital powers their Seats maintain,
And work new Spirits to support the Brain,
There fell the Blow; wide gaped the horrid wound
To let in Fate, and the vast Hero groaned:
The blood sprang out, his mouth his left hand smote
And shattered Teeth fell down his battered throat:
His Cheeks were beaten close, his Nose grew flat,
And trebled Blows still urged his hasty Fate:
The Hero fell extended over the Plain,
Gave over the Fight, nor could he rise again,
His hands stretched out, as, whilst he breathed his last,
He meant to keep off Fate that came too fast,
Here no proud word, and no disdainful Eye
On thy lost Foe did stain thy Victory;
But he by his great Father Neptune swore,
That he would never injure Strangers more:
Thus have I Pollux sung, and paid my due,
My next, great Castor, must be graced by you.

Castor and Pollux had taken away Phaebe and Talaris the Daughters of Lucippus,
who were betrothed to Lynceus and Idas the Sons of Aphareus: A War ensueing
Castor kills Lynceus, and Idas is slain by Thunder.

NOW had the Valiant Sons of mighty Jove,
Grown fierce and too injurious by their Love
Lucippus Daughters seized, and forced away
Their beauteous prize, and melancholy prey:
Aphareus Sons pursued, resolved to try
Their Force, and gain their promised Brides, or dye;
Both sides now meet at brave Aphareus Tomb,
Which Fate designed the Lovers Field of doom;
All from their Chariots leap, for fight prepare,
Well armed, and well appointed for the War:
When Lynceus thus beneath his Helmet spoke,
The Valleys Echoed, and the Mountains shook:
What means this rage, this impious violence,
To ravish first, then fight in its defense?
What mean the Shields and Spears, these Iron bands,
And naked Weapons in your threatening Hands?
Lucippus Daughters are by right our due,
Betrothed to us before e're known to you:
His Oaths confirmed it, and 'twas base by stealth
To covet others right, and others wealth;
By gifts to bribe him, and his mind pervert,
And win by Art, unable by desert:
And often I, your base designs to check,
Have said, tho I can better fight than speak;
Unprincely it is to court another's Spouse,
And tempt weak Innocence to break her Vows:
Sparta and Elis breed a numerous race,
All perfect Beauties both in mind and face:
There you may Court, and whom you please may have,
What Parents will refuse the rich and brave?
Permit our Match, let us our right pursue,
And we will join to find fit Brides for you:
These were my words, but these the wanton Winds
Bore to the floods, they never reached your Minds,
For both inexorabl^ bent appeard,
You heard, but never regarded what you heard:
Yet now be just, our promised Brides restore,
For we are Kin, and then I ask no more:
But if you needs must fight, if War desire,
If naught but Blood can quench your lustful fire;
Let Pollux and let Idas Arms forbear,
And never try the hated chance of War;
Let* Castor, you and I the fight maintain,
And see whose Courage shows the bravest Man:
For this will give our Friends sufficient proof,
And if one fal^s there will be loss enough;
Let some survive to cheer our drooping friends,
And wed the Maids, and make them just amends:
For this is friendly to restrain our heat,
And make the loss but small, when the Contention's great*
Thus Lynceus spoke, to this both sides agree,
And Jove confirmed it by his ^ixt decree;
Pollux and Idas laid there Armor by,
Attending on their Brother's Victory:
Lynceus did first within the lists appear
Beneath his Shield he shook his threatening Spear,
Then Castor came, strong Shields did guard their Breasts,
And on their Helmets nodded dreadful Crests;
First with their Spears began the noble strife,
Each sought to find an open pass to Life;
But all invain, the Shields the strokes endured,
Their Spears were blunted, and the Men secured;
Their Swords they drew, the Blades like Lightning shone
Before the Thunderbolt falls swiftly down;
Now rose their Fury, Castor bravely pressed,
He pierced his Shield and chopped the waveing Crest;
And many thrusts the quick-ey'd Lynceus made
The Shield, and Crest once felt his furious Blade:
But Castor stepping backward reached a blow,
And struck his Wrist, and tamed his haughty foe,
Disabled thus, and grown unfit for fight
He dropped his weapon, and prepared for flight
To his great Father's Tomb, where Idas sat,
A sad Spectator of his Brothe^'s Fate:
But Castor soon pursued, close thrusts he made,
And through his Belly forced his thundering Blade;
Out rusht his Bowels through the gapeing wound,
And he fell forward on the shakeing ground,
Cold Death came on and did his heart surprise,
And Sleep Eternal sat upon his Eyes.
Nor did his Mother valiant Idas lead
With pious wishes to his Marriage bed,
For to revenge falln Lynceus hasty doom
He tore a Pillar from the sacred Tomb,
To dart at Castor, dreadfully he stood,
The fierce Revenger of his Brother's blood;
Jove interposed, and by his strickt command
Swift Lightning struck the Marble from his hand,
He strove to reach it, but his Soul was fired,
He fell, and in no Common Destiny expired:
Thus must the Brothers still victorious prove,
So Great in Courage, and allied to Jove.
Hail Leda's Sons, still vigorous strength infuse,
And still preserve the Honor of my Muse:
You, Helen, and the Valiant Brave that strove
At Troy for Injured Menelaus Love,
Poets have served, for with exalted rage
They tell your fame, and spread through future Age;
Homer has raised it with a lofty thought,
He writes with the same Spirit that you fought;
He sings the Grecian fleet, grave Nestor's care,
And brave Achilles, fortress of the War:
I bring the Tribute of a meaner Muse,
Those humble strains her spareing Heats infuse;
Yet this is all, the best that I can do,
The utmost that my Talent will allow:
And to the Gods, let Riches vainly strive,
Songs are the greatest present Men can give.
FINIS.
