EDward, Duke of Somerset, Earl of Hertford, Viscount Beauchamp* Lord Seymour*
Governor of the person of the Kings Majesty of England, and Protector of
all his Realms, Dominions, and subjects, his lieuetenaunt general of all his
armies, both by land and by sea, Tresorer and Earl Marshall of England,
Governor of the Isles of Gernsey and Iersey, and Knight of the most noble
order of the Garter: To all the nobles and gentlemen of the Realm of
Scotland, and the common people of the same, gretyng.
Whereas the most victorious Prince of famous memory King Henry the.VIII. our
late sovereign Lord now decessed, and the Earl of Arrayn, Governor of the
Realm of Scotland, with thaduise and consent of you in Parliament,
considering what gracious opportunity and mean, the almighty and living God
had then sent (as he yet does) tappease the wrath, displeasure and enemitie,
which rather by the prouocacion of others then of our own inclinacions, being
both of one descent of blood, and of one language, and by the main seas
separated from all other nations, had of long time continued emonges us one
against the other, thought it most expedient, as well to the glory of God and
his holy word, thonor and surety of both the Princes of England and
Scotland, and the weal and benefit of their Realms and Subjects, that the
Kings Majesty our sovereign Lord that now is, should take to wife the
Queen's grace your Maistres. We upon the foresaied Godly consideracions,
thinkyng theffecte thereof meet to be followed, and the marriage of both
Princes, for the weal of both the Realms, the particular commodity of each
person in every estate, and for the Godly fulfillyng of Gods pleasure, to his
glory most expedient and necessary to be perfaicted and executed, and this
goodly occasion that God has sent, to be of every honest and true English
and Sctottishe man, with all his power, heart and will, meet to be embraced,
are now upon great deliberacion had before hand, with sundery Godly and
wisemen, as well of England as of Scotland, come into this realm: not as an
enemy to the Queen or any fo the realm, that mind the perfeccion of this
peace and coniunccion in marriage of both Princes, but as friend and a
co^seruator of them (we take God to judge) and we are come in this manner,
which pretends a force in appearance (but not in deed) only to defend and
maintein the honor of both the Princes and realms, and by fire and swoorde,
to chastise such as will be rebels to the same, or go about either by
practices, assemblyng of armies, or by any other forcible way or means to
withstand us, or to declare themselfes against the perfeccion of the peace,
and the marriage of both the Princes: Nor we mind by this coniunccion of
marriage, to do any more prejudice to this reamle of Scotland, then to the
Realm of England, but with thaduise of the noble men, and good men of both
the Realms, to unite them togeders in one name, by the name of Britons, and
in one such a friendly kind of living, and such a liberty and preservation
of the laws of Scotland, with an indifferent administracion of Justice, to
each person equally, as they shall well find, both the glory of God and his
word advanced, the bishop of Romes usurped iurisdiccion abolished, the honor
of both the Realms preserved, and the subjects of the same well satisfied and
contented: Praiyng you therefore, and exhortyng you all noble men and good men
of this Realm, to join with us and assist us in this behalf: And we assure
you of out honor, and before God, that whosoever will come into us, and make
unto us for their parts, sufficient assurance to theffect aforsaied, we will
kyndely and freely accept it, geuyng by virtue hereof, free liberty unto all
such as will agree to this most Godly purpose, to enter our Camp: and such
as will bring unto us any kind of victaill, shall not only not be endomaged
in their persons or gooddes (for we entende to persecute with thextremitie all
such, be they English or Scottishe, as shall hurt or harm them in body or
good, and so we have notified to all our army) but also besides their free
access and conversation in our said Camp, they shall be by special order from
us, truly satisfied and contented for the same. For we entende to pass
amicably (if we be not empeched by them) without diuastacion of any man's
good or cattle, other then of those, who shall declare themselfes
repugnauntes, and contrary to the good meaning aforesaied: and without doing to
the well willers of both the Realms, the least hurt or damage we can, saving
somewhat in forage, which cannot be aduoyded where an army marches.
