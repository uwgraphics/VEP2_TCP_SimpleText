To The Respective MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE of COMMONS, THE HUMBLE APPLICATION. Of
the PEOPLE, Commonly Called QUAKERS.
WE the said People, being a Member of that Body which You Represent, and
concerned in Trade and Industry, and Employing many Poor in the Manufactories
of this Nation; as also in Contributing to the Charge of the Government
according to our Abilities; Do Desire and Humbly Crave, That our Liberties,
Rights and Properties, may be Secured to us and ours; That we may no longer be
Exposed to Unjust and Vexatious Suits, nor be a Prey to Ill Disposed Persons,
who take Advantage against us, to Prosecute and Ruin us, merely because in
point of Tender Conscience, We dare not Swear in any Case; which is in
Obedience to the Command of our Blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, as we
verily believe is our Duty in this Gospel-Day; but hold our selves Obliged to
Declare and Testify the Truth without Oath, in Cases wherein our Answers and
Testimonies may be required.

Wherefore we Humbly Entreat Your Christian Compassion in Your Favorable
Acceptance of our Petition, which is, For Leave to bring in a Bill for our
Relief; and so to Consider our Suffering-Case, as if it were Your Own, and You
in our stead; That we and our Posterities, may have Cause to Bless the Lord on
Your Behalf.
