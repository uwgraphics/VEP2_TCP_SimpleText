I Having heard several discourses and opinions since my being in England
concerning the Battle fought near unto old Rosse in Ireland, between our Army
commanded by the now Lord Marquis of Ormond as General, my Lord Lisle
Lieutenant General of the Horse, my self being Major General; by which
discourses, and variety of opinions, I find that many are mistaken in the truth
thereof. So as I having by me some collections, as also the manner and form of
the Battle, I have thought fit according to my best knowledge to set down the
passages of that service as near as I can: which is as follows.

Our present wants being so great at Dublin at that time, as the then Lords
Justices, viz: Sir William Parsons, and Sir John Borlerie Knights, could find
no means to support the great charge of our Army: no supplies coming out of
England for our relief at that time, and the Soldiers in great want. The Lord
Lisle Lieutenant General of the Horse, was pleased to propound a journey in
hope to gain a livelihood abroad in the Enemies quarters, for the better
subsistence of the Army, which after mature deliberation had at the Counsel
Table it was resolved on; and that accordingly the Lord Lisle should go. And
for the better enabling of our Army to march, and for furthering that design,
most of the Counsel did lend good sums of money (and some melted their
Plate) or gave it in to be melted for that service: which moneys so lent was
accordingly received, and issued unto the Officers, upon my own knowledge, I
being appointed both to receive it, and to pay it out by order of the Counsel
Table: all things being in a readiness for the journey, but whither intended
unknown to me. The now Lord Marquis of Ormond, our then General, was pleased
to signify unto the Lords Justices and Counsel that if the Army went forth
his Lordship would go along with it himself, and did so, taking order that a
Ship should be sent about unto Duncannon Fort, with a supply of Biscuit and
provision if need should be; giving unto Sir Philip Persevall Commissary
General of the victuals, forty pounds for the hire of the Ship so employed:
and when our Army came near unto Carloe Castle, it was drawn into battalia, and
a Counsel of War called, and thee resolved on, that we should march unto
Rosse to besiege, and to take it in. And coming before the Town we quartered
there, and the second day we planted our Ordnance for batery, which were two
Demi Culverins; the next day the Enemy put over into the Town two thousand men,
there being but two Companies in before: which supply putting in, it was not
possible for us to hinder, they being on the contrary side the River to us. But
notwithstanding that supply so put in, we proceeded with our battery and made a
breach, which we assaulted with certain of our Forces chosen out for that
purpose: Sir Fowlk Hunks, and Major Morris having the command and full
management of that service; Major Morris being there dangerously hurt in the
Assault, and brought off, and by reason of the multitude of the defenders, who
had stopped the breach with wooll-packs, and feather-beds, and other provisions,
so as we could do no good in it. I had order from the Lord General to draw
them off, which I accordingly did, in which service we lost some few men; the
weather being extreme ill was a great hindrance to our proceedings. For during
the time we were before the Town of Rosse, we had scarce a fair day in
fourteen, which was the time, according to my best remembrance, that we stayed.

During which time, we lived in daily hopes of the coming of our Ship with
provisions, which failed by contrary winds, and never came unto us; insomuch as
our store being exhausted, and spent, my Lord General employed Sir Thomas
Armstrong to the Lord Esmond, governor of Duncannon Fort, to see with what
provisions his Lordship could furnish us with: who sent unto the relief of our
A^my ten thousand weight of Biscuit, being all he could spare us as he alleged;
and withal commanded two Barks or Vessels to fall down to Rosse, that then lay
by the Fort, which Vessels shot many shot into the Town, much annoying the
Enemy. But the Enemy drew a piece of Ordnance to the other side of the water,
with which they so battered the ships lying at ancher, that the Mariners were
forced to forsake their ships, and to bore holes in them to sink them, by
reason they could not get off their ships again, the wind being contrary, and
ill weather: and that being done, the Seamen came into our quarter, and stayed
with our Army where they did very good service.

We had not lain long before Rosse before we were informed of the approach of
the Army of the Enemy, under the command of General Preston, and Colonel
Cullin their Lieutenant General; who at last came and quartered within a
league of us, which hindered our Horse from forraging abroad, they being, as we
were informed, near upon seven thousand strong Horse and Foot, with the Forces
that were in Rosse, which presently joined with them after our remove from the
Town. Which remove of ours was caused through want of provisions for our Army,
not having above three days bread for the Soldiers, and being above
threescore miles from Dublin, having a powerful Army attending on us. We
raising ouir fiege, the Army of the Enemy withdrew further off to a wood and a
bogge, where the Forces in Rosse came to them. That night we retired from
Rosse, we quartered about six miles from Rosse, and within two miles of old
Rosse upon an Heath, from whence we might and did discover where the Enemy
quartered. The next morning we marched toward the Enemy, who relying upon his
strength, being two thousand more by report then our Army was, he forsook the
woods and boggs, and met us in the plain field, having a bogge behind him. We
coming near unto them, my Lord General of our Army gave me direction to draw
into battalia, which accordingly I did, and caused our Ordnance to be planted:
that being done, the Lord Lisle appointed some Horse to go to discover the Army
of the Enemy, and how they lay. Against which the Enemy sent out a greater
number of their Horse, so as our Horse retired back to us again in good order;
the Enemy following them, and at a far distance fired upon their arrear, but
did no hurt, and so returned again into their quarters; a small rising ground
being between their Army and ours, my Lord General called me to him, saying,
If we could get to that high piece of ground and possess it, it might much
advantage us in that days service, for we should have the Sun and the wind
with us, and also plainly see the Enemies motions, and how they stood in
battalia. Whereupon I caused the Army to march in full battalia and possessed
that ground, the whole Army of the Enemy standing before us in a plain not a
Musket shot from us; their Horse being in a great lane or highway, ready to
have issued out upon us. Whereupon I disposed of our forlorn hope of Musketeers
commanded that day by Captain Atkins, along a ditch side that was betwixt our
Army and the Enemies, with direction to the Captain to ply his Musketeers in
continual playing upon the battalions of the Enemy, which lay within Musket
shot of us. In the mean time I caused the Ordnance to be planted in the most
advantageous places, and planted the two Demi Culverins in the mouth of the
Lane where the Enemies horse stood; where with the two first shot that were
made amongst them, our Ordnance slew at least threescore horse and men,
insomuch as the Enemies horse would not endure the second charge, nor stay the
discharging any more in that place, but hastened into the field on their left
hand, where rainging their men anew.

I saw the Lord Lisle Lieutenant General of the Horse, and Sir Thomas Lucas
Commissary General of our Horse, preparing all our Horse ready to charge the
Enemies Horse, our Ordnance continually beating upon the Enemies Forces, the
Enemy having no Ordnance in the field that day, which was no small happiness
to us as I conceived. Our horse being ready with their swords drawn and in
their bridle hands, their Pistols in the other hand. I saw the Lord Lisle with
the horse pass over a ditch into the plain where the Enemies horse were; and I
saw our horse and the Enemies horse charge each other; and I saw Pistols go off
and discharged at each other: and while I was otherwise employed that day in
the Army of the Foot, the Enemies horse and ours passed by on the right hand of
our battery, hewing and flashing each other; and being so past by the right
hand of our Army, a sudden stand was made by them for a little while, but were
still in action exchanging blows with each other; which stand so made, as I was
after informed, was caused by a shot the Lord Lisle his horse had in his knee,
and the fall of Sir Thomas Lucas his horse with him, who vas dangerously hurt
in his head, before he could be recovered; and being recovered, I savv all the
horse pursuing each other tovvard the place where our wagon and carriages
stood. And as I was after informed, our Horse had there a strong encounter with
the Horse of the Rebels; in which conflict diverse prisoners of the Enemy were
taken, and amongst them Colonel Cullin their Lieutenant General, unto whom
quarter was given, and after, by order of the Lord General, committed unto my
charge and safe keeping; of whom I took charge, and kept him safe until I
brought him to the Castle of Dublin (my then government) where I delivered the
said Colonel Cullin into the hands of the then Lords Justices, viz: Sir
William Parsons, and Sir John Borlacie, and in regard of my other employments
that day amongst the Foot, I was no eyewitness of what was further done
betwixt them: only I heard that our Horse had the better of the Enemies horse,
and hat the Enemies fled and were routed; and certain I am, that the Horse of
the Enemy never returned to the Army of their Foot that day any more, so long
as we were in fight with them, the day of the battle.

Over which Army of the Rebels Foot, although much stronger then ours in
number, it pleased God (in the absence of both ours and the Enemies Horse) to
give us an happy victory, our Ordnance doing us very good service that day. In
which service and victory the Enemy lost many of their prime gentlemen of their
Country that day; the rest that escaped fled over the bogge, and rallied again
on a hill on the other side of a bogge, and hard by a wood side where part of
our Army following of them, they instantly ran into the wood, leaving all their
ammunition and baggage behind them which we took; and the Enemy never left
marching till they got over the Barrow a River, where being over, they broke
down the Bridge, fearing our Army should pursue them, which as I conceived was
a second happy victory, in regard our Army with our Ordnance and many
Carriages was to pass through many great straights, woods, and stony and
rockie passages, which having no hindrances but the illness of the ways, we
had enough to do to make our passage through them; and had the Rebels
intercepted us upon those passages, certain I am he would have endangered our
Army, we having not above two days bread or scarce so much; and by being
hindered or retarded in our journey, we should through want have been in danger
to be lost. All our Horse as soon as the victory was gained over the Foot of
the Enemy (or in a little time after) the Enemies Horse being fled, came to us,
and quartered by us; my Lord General and my Lord Lisle after viewing the dead
bodies, and giving order to the Pioneers to bury them, quartered in the place
or field where the Enemy was overthrown. The next day to my best knowledge our
Army marched homewards toward Dublin without seeing any Enemy more in all our
journey, but what we saw marching on the other side of the River the Barrow
toward Kilkennie; and in our way homeward we burnt and spoiled the Enemies
Country. And this being as near as my observation taken, and my best memory
can inform me, I shall conclude, that I hope this may satisfy the unsatisfied.

Sir Francis Willoughby having imparted unto us this above-written Discourse,
we do testify that it does agree to our best remembrance with such Relations
as were brought unto us at the Council Board from several Officers and
others, of the actions of that Army after they parted from us at Dublin, until
they returned thither again.
