SAINT AVSTINS RELIGION.

WHEREIN IS MAnifestly proved out of the Works of that Learned Father, that he
dissented from Popery, and agreed with the Religion of the Protestants in all
the maine Points of Faith and Doctrine.

Contrary to that Impudent, Erroneous, and Slanderous Position of the bragging
Papists of our Times, who falsely affirm, we had no Religion before the Times
of Luther and Calvin.

SVch is the gross ignorance of most Papists in these their times, that they
neither know what they do, or should believe: much like the Host in P^o^. Bren.

mere invention of the Devil, that lay men should read the Scripture; and

therefore ignorance of the word is best. And as Conf. Petric. cap. 14. pa. 18.
Hosius says, To know nothing, is to know all things, and instead of Bibles,
they have invented Images and Crucifixes, (wherewith too many Dames (in these
conniuing days) adorn their shameless breasts) and Mass books, commonly
imprinted with a mixture of red letters to signify the die of their Religion,
but as for the Scripture, they are far more dangerous, then the l Fran^*

much less may they read them: and if any be permitted to study the Scripture,
it must be such a part thereof as has bin hallowed with their Expurgatory

And now you poor seduced souls, why do your holy Fathers constrain you to
believe ye know not what? and restrain you from the knowledge of Scripture?
(whence your faith if it be sound* must be truly collected) and the ignorance
whereof is the root of all Math. 2^. 29.
error, and the cause of unbelief: is it not because they would have your
souls to depend on their lips? (under whose tongue is the poison of asps is it
not because they would carry their hellish positions and practices as in a
cloud out of your sight? Is it not because they know that the splendour of Gods
word will soon disperse that Egyptian darkness they keep you in? is it not
because like Satan they would 2. Tim. ^. 2^.
take you at their pleasure?

But yet such is the impudency of your false prophets, that notwithstanding,
they will tell you, that they teach nothing without the special warrant of
Scripture, and that all the Fathers were Papists, and held their opinions:
both which are their own fictions, and false. For the first, they will neither
abide the trial of our faith by the Word of God, (which was the reason that
See the Fisher caught in his own net.
Fisher in his last Conference, neither could nor would deny, that the
Protestants professed the same faith which Christ and his Apostles taught) nor
yet of their own religon; and the reason is, because it wholly depends upon
the Traditions of the new Romish Church, which is confirmed by Can. Greg. d.
40. in an. marg.
Gregory the thirteenth, where he says, Let men receive with more reverence,
what the Pope teaches, then the Scriptures. And Canus loc. l. 3 cap. 3. page
131
Canus confesses, that most points of the Roman Faith, are not contained in
the Scripture: And Andrad. Orthod. expl. li. 2.
Andradius speaks plainly, that many points of their Faith must needs reele
and totter, if they were not supported by the help of Tradition; and this is
the cause your Masse-priestes will not endure, that the Resolution of the now
depending Controversies between us and them, should be by the authority of
the Scriptures, but run from them to the Fathers, from them to the Church,
fromthence to the Pope, from him to Councels, and from these to their own
Judgments.

Now for the second, If the Fathers were Papists, as they say, why do their
chief Doctors condemn, and contemn them? Bellar. Purg. lib. 2. cap. 8.
Bellarmine says, That Saint Origin was burnt in Hell with Arrius, and
Nestorius; and that Bellar. Romans pont. li. 4. ca. 8
Tertullian was a Montanist. Alphons. adv. Haeres.
Alphonsus, that he will believe Anacletus, better then Saint Jerome, or Saint
Augustine. Tolet. Romans 9. page 421.
Tollet the Jesuit says, That he will believe neither Augustine, nor
Ambrose, nor Chrysostom, nor Theodoret, nor Photius: the like ^steeme they
have of Cyprian, Gregory, Beda, and the rest, i^ in any point they make
against them, and their doctrine.

And no marvel, for the ^rro^ A^tic. Paris. c. ^. p. 1^0*
Doctors of Paris profess boldly, that they will not believe either Gratian, or
Aquinas, or Lumbard, or Anse^me, or Hugo, because they were erroneous. Bell. d^

Bellarmine again condemns Scotus, Durand, Gabriel, Ariminensis, Capreolus,
and Marsi^ius in the point of Free will: and yet all these were Popish Writers,
famous and most eminent in their times.

Nay, which is more worthy observation, though they teach, that the Scriptures
and Fathers must have their authority from the Pope, and that we Alua Pe^ag.

ought to stand rather to his judgment, then the judgment of the whole world;

that he is above Church and Councels, Quanto de trans^. Episc. in Glossa.
and that he may make that to be the meaning of things, which indeed is not
(as they affirm:) yet notwithstanding they will not submit themselves in
opinion and judgment to the Pope: and therefore the Venetians boldly published
Conclusions against Paulus Quintus, and his Supremacy; Cath. de cert. great.

Catharinus holds it unmeet, that wise men should bind themselves to the
judgment of the Pope, seeing he is not always assisted by the Spirit of God.

many learned Papists have written against his Decrees in Councels.

These things being apparent and true (if we may believe your own Writers,
here only cited) what good acceptance can this Book expect from you? although
it do truly set forth unto you the mind and judgment of an holy and learned
Father, disagreeing from your opinions in sixty two several points? If your
Teachers will be tried neither by Scriptures, nor Fathers, nor Pope, Saint
Augustine will hardly prevail: yet because they boa^^ to you, that all the
Fathers were Papists, and especially Saint Augustine, ye shall do well for
your better satisfaction, and the trial of their spirits, to read this ensuing
Treatise, most faithfully and painfully collected from his writings, and for
your ease digested into a few sheets of paper.

To conclude, search the Scriptures, study the Fathers, and read the
Antiquaries, and see if in them ye can find Rabbis comparable to your
Clerks, or whether a^y Christian or Pagan ever taught or did as they, whether
any of their Priests like them, did seek to strangle the vital spirits of
humane society, teaching Haereticis licitu^ est auferri, quae habent Dec^.

and you Catholics, ^ot to preserve, but to seek the blood and life of your
parents, brethren, kindred, and countrymen.

Did ye ever hear or read of any Churchmen, that have employed Poynadoes,
Poison, or Saltpeter, as they have done? or can you find, or they prove, that
ever any Protestant Bishop, like Pope Sixtus the fourth, with his Legate, did
murder two Volateran says, they were Princes of Medices.
Princes in the Church at Mass? (much like to Luke 13. 1.
Pilate, that mingled the blood of the Galileans with their sacrifice) did ever
any of our Priests, mix poison with the powder of Adamant, in a Communion
Cup, with the precious blood of Christ, to poison an Emperor, as Romans concl.
Bernard a Friar did, when therewith he destroyed Henry the 7. at Bonconuent?
Were there ever such Artizans, and Engines of villainy of our Religion, that
with a poisoned knife did stab a King, as Clement a Friar did Henry the third
of France? or with a spark of fire would have blown up the whole body of a
kingdom, as Garnet the Archpriest with his fellows attempted not long since?
And yet these are your holy Fathers and Confessors, whom you follow and adore;
take heed therefore what you learn of these, let them not alienate your souls
from God, and your hearts from your country, and assure your selves, that so
long as ye follow them, ye shall neither get sound comfort, nor a good
conscience. Deuteronomy. 32. 29
Oh thar ye were wise, then would ye understand this, ye would consider your
latter end.

St. AUGUSTINES Religion: Wherein is proved that he dissented from Popery,
and agreed with the Religion of the Protestants in all the maine points of
Faith and Doctrine.
IT is hottly Controuerted, between us, and the Papists at this day, Whether
the Ancient Fathers, and especially Saint Austin, was of their Religion, or of
ours? The Campion rat. 5.
Papists challenge all the ancient Fathers, as theirs: and especially, Saint
Austin. Of him they bragg above measure. He ( The Mass. pr. Petition to his
Majesty. Aun. 1604. Sect. 26.
they say) was a Monk, a Professor, and a stout Defender, and a strong
maintainer of their Popery: undoubtedly no Protestant. The particulars of his
doctrine ( Austins Religion, chapter 1. p. 1^.
they say) touching the several points this day in Controversy, were
consonant and agreeable with their now professed Popery. All the Haeresies of
this Age, Vnius Augusti verbis confutari and proteri vel maxim possunt: may be
confuted and confounded by proofs fetched only from Saint Austins writings,
Torrensis Fp. Dedicat. praefix. August. confess.
say the Papists. Whereof, to make some show unto the world, as Torrensis a
Jesuit in the year 1569. published in Latin a Collection, out of Saint
Austins works, of all such speeches as he thought made in any sort for them,
and against us; intiteling that his Collection by the name of Confessio
Augustinian^: So Anno 1620*
about two years since, one Brereby Priest (whether Secular, or Jesuit, I know
not) has published in English such an other Collection, out of the same Saint
Austins Works, intitling it, Saint Austins Religion. Now for the discovery of
this their insolent bragging of Saint Austin, I have thought good, to undertake
the proouing of this Assertion. Viz. That Saint Austin was rather of our
Religion, then of the Papists: for as much, as in the most material points he
is undoubtedly for us, and against them.

That Saint Austin, in the most material points of Doctrine, is for us, and
against the Papists: the ensuing instances prove manifestly. For

1 FIrst, It is questioned between us and Papists, How far forth Fathers are
to be followed? And Author Gloss Marg. in Grand. ^. Noli meis, Impress. An.
151^.
some of them say, Scripta Sanctorum sunt ad vnguem obseruanda. The writings of
the Fathers are to be observed to a nails breadth. Author alter^us Gloss. ibid.
Others, Hodie iubentur omnia teneri vsque ad vltimum iota. At this day we are
bound to believe every thing they say. But Harmon Confess Sect. 1. de sacra
Scriptura.
we say, They are so far forth to be believed as they agree with holy
Scripture, and no further. Against which Assertion of ours, they take great
exception. For, This is to give no more credit to their authority, then to
Jews, Turks, and Heretics, and so it is quite to reject their authorities,
says In his answer to Su^cliffes reply to the Survey, chap. 4. Sect 6. page 66.
Kellison. Yet St. Austin was of our opinion herein. Saint Austin thought not
good to follow the Fathers any further, neither did he require that any man
should follow him any further. He as we took liberty, and gave liberty to
judge of the Fathers writings according to their agreement, or disagreement
with holy Scriptures.

That he took liberty to himself to judge so, it appears by this: That when
he was pressed by Cresconius the Grammarian with a Testimony taken out of an
Epistle of Saint Cyprians, Lib. 2. cont. Crescon. Gram. cap. 32.
he answered thus. Ego eius Epistolae authorita^e non teneor, quia literas
Cypriani non vt Canonicas habeo* sed ^as ex Canonicis considero, and quod in
ijs diuinarum Scripturarum authoritati congruit, cum laud eius accipio: quod
autem non congruit, cum pace eius respuo. I am not bound to stand to be tried
by that Epistle, because I do not account of Cyprians Epistles as of Canonical
Scriptures, but examine the^ by the Canonical Scriptures: and what I find in
them agreeable to the holy Scriptures, I receive it with his commendation: what
I find to disagree from holy Scriptures, with his good leave, I leave it. For
hereby we are taught (as Jn edit Iugdun^nsi, Anno 1^70.
Erasmus noted in the Margent over against these words) Quomodo tam S.
Cypriani dicta, quam aliorum Doctorum accipienda sint. How far forth we are
to esteem of the speeches of Saint Cyprian, and other of the Doctors.

Again, the same appears by this, that in the Controversy between him and
Saint Ierom, Whether St. Paul, Galat 2 14. reproved Saint Peter colourably, or
in good earnest: where Epis^. 11. inter Epis^. August.
Ierom alleged seven Fathers against his Assertion: viz. Origin, Didimus,
Apollinaris, Alexander, Eusebius Emisenus, Theodorus, and Chrysostom; of which
Fathers, Ierom made so great account, that he desired Austin to suffer him to
err with them, if he thought him to err. Austin would not yield to Jerome,
though he could but name two Fathers who were of his mind, but appeals to
Saint Paul himself from all Saint Ieroms Fathers, saying: Epistola 1^.
Pro his omnibus, imo supra hos omnes Apostolus Paulus occurrit: ad ipsum
confugio, ad ipsum ab omnibus qui aliud sentiunt literarum eius tractatoribus
interpello, etc. I have Paul the Apostle himself instead of these all, and
above these all. To him do I fly. To him I appeal from all the Doctors (his
Interpreters) which are of other minds, for this shows he would not follow
the Fathers further then he thought they agreed with holy Scriptures.

That he gave liberty to others to judge so, it is plain by these words. Noli
meis literis quasi Canonicis Scripturis i Pro^n^. ^ib. ^. de Trinita^e.
ins^ruire: sed in illis and quae non credibas, cuminueneris incunctanter
creed: in istis autom quod certum non habebas, nisi certum intellex^ris, n^li
firmum tenere. Give not like credit to my Writings as to the Canonical
Scriptures. If thou find any thing in the Canonical Scriptures which thou
beleeuest not before, believe it presently upon thy finding of it: but if thou
find any thing in any writings whereof thou wast not persuaded before,
unless thou perceive it to be a certain truth, do not believe it for truth
And by these. (...) (...) Anima (...) origin a* Vi^ce^^ ^i^or Cap. 1.

Gloz^r on the Canon Law, and by Sn^m. de Ecc^* ^iv. 4. part 2. cap. 9.
Cardinal Turrecremate. For upon mention of these and such like places as these
are Loquitur Augustinus secundum illa tempora cum adhuc scripta Augustins and
aliorum Patrum non erant authention. Saint Austin spoke (say they) agreeably to
those times, wherein his, and other holy Fathers Writings were not
Authentical. For such words argue, that in their opinion, Saint Austins, and
other holy Fathers writings, were not in Saint Austins time, in so great
request, as now with Papists. They were no further to be believed then, then
men saw good proof, good reason. Such is acknowledged in plainer D^ceptationes

faciundum. It is lawful for every man who seeks to boult out the Truth by way
of disputation to differ in opinion from such holy men as lived since the
Apostles days: provided they have greater authority and better reason to
induce them to the contrary.

2 It is questioned between us and Papists, Whether, When there is difference
in Bibles about the reading of the Text, the Originals should rather be
believed then the Translation, that is, Whether the Hebrew of the Old
Testament, and the Greek of the new Testament should be preferred before the
vulgat Latin. The Azorius Jnstit. Moral. part. 1. lib. 8. Cap. 3. 2. quaeritur.
Papists in our days teach, That now, Non est quod ad Hebraica vel Graeca
recurramus exemplaria: there is no reason why we should have recourse to the
Hebrew, or to the Greek. Now the vulgat Latin is so Authentical, Cent. Trid.
sess. 4. decret. de Edit. and vsu sac. lib
Vt nemo illa reiicere quouis praetextu audeat. No man may be so bold under any
pretense or color to reject it. Now Analysis fidei lib. 8. Cap. 5. page 75.
Graeci and Hebraici Codices, sicubi a vulgata editione dissideant; per
vulgatam corrigendi and emendandi sunt. If the Hebrew or the Greek Books
differ from the vulgat Latin, they are to be corrected and amended by the
vulgat Latin, says Gregory de Valentia But we teach the contrary. And that S.
Austin is of our opinion herein, it is plain by his own words: for, Lib. 15.
de ciuit* Dei. Cap. 13.
Ei Linguae potius credatur vnde est in aliam, per Jnterpretes facta
Translatio. When there is difference in Books and both cannot be true; believe
thou rather says S. Augustine, what is written in the Book translated, then
in the Translation. And Lib 2. de doct. Christ. Cap. 11.
Latinae Linguae homines duabus aliis ad diuinarum Scripturarum cognitionem
habent opus, Hebraica scilicet and Graeca, vt ad exemplaria praecedentia
recurratur, si quam dubitationem attulerit Latinorum Jnterpretum infinita
varietas. Those men who understand Latin, stand in need of two other Languages
for the better understanding of holy Scripture, to wit, Hebrew and Greek to
the end that when any doubt arises by reason of the multiplicity of Latin
Translations, they may have recourse unto the Originalls, says the same
Austin. And so much is confessed by Azorius the Jesuit, and by Lud^uicus
Viues: for, Olim cum multa esset Latinorum Codicum varietas, patres dicebant,
ad Hebraicos vel Graecos Codices recurrendum esse Sic Hieronimus, sic
Augustinns. In former days when there was great variety of Latin Copies, the
Fathers such as Jerome and Austine, held opinion that we might have recourse
to the Hebrew or Greek Copies, says Loco sup^aec^tato.
Azorius. And Hocipsum Hieronimus clamat, hoe ipsad^cet ratio, and nullus est
saniore iudicio qui repugnat. The same truth is taught by Jerome, and enen
reason it self confirms the fame: neither does any man of sound judgment
think otherwise, says ^n^^t* in dug. (...) ^ci. (...) (...) Cap. 13.

3 The Papists teach, That the Apostles had no Commandment from God to write

not true that God commanded the Apostles to write any thing, says Lib* ^. de

Christus) de suis factis and dictis nos legere voluit, hoc scribendum illis,

read concerning his words or wor^es, that he commanded his Apostles to write as

4 The N. S. in his Antid^te against English Sectaries. cont^ 2. cap. 1. page 28
Papists generally teach That all things necessary to salvation are not
contained in Scripture. And we teach the contrary. The Bell Lib 3. de verbo

Papists generally teach. That the Scriptures are full of obscurity: and
Gr^tser. d^f^ns. ^ell, ^o. 1. lib. 3. cap. 1. col. 1117.
one of the greatest Rufflers among them at this day, is not ashamed to say,
Scriptura^ totam etiam vbi clarissima videtur, ita esse difficilem and
obscuram, vt Jnterprete certo egeat, qui nobis veram eius sententiam aperiat.
The whole Scripture, even where it seems most plain, is yet so hard and
obscure, that it stands in need of a special Expositor, who may open unto us
the meaning of it. But we say, though some places of Scripture be wonderful
obscure, and standin need of Interpreters; yet such matters as concern
Salvation, are so plainly set down, that they may easily be learned without
any such set and special Expositor, as Papists drea^e of. Now that S. Austin
is of our opinion in both these questions, it is plain by his own words: For
speaking of the propagation of Original sin and of souls, and being sore
puzzled about the point at length he concludes thus. Illud credo d Lib. 2. de
peccat merit etc. cap. 36.
quod eti^m hinc (1. de hac re) diuinorum eloquiorum clarissima esset
authoritas, si homo illud sine dispendio promissae salutis ignorare non posset.
I verily persuade my self there should have been plain proof hereof in holy
Scripture, if a man might not be ignorant thereof without danger of his
salvation. And ^ib. 2. de doct*. Christ. cap. 9.
Jn ijs quae aperte in Scriptura posita sunt, inueniuntur illa omnia quae
continent fidem moresque viuendi. All things concerning faith and manners are
plainly set down in Scripture, says the same S. Austin, upon another
occasion. Which latter testimony is so pregnant, that Apolog. pro 2. part.
Enchirid. contra Gomar, cap. 6. p. 356.
Costerus the Jesuit, is driven by the evidence of it, and another such like
testimony of S. Chrysostomes, to deny there is any Controversy between us and
them Sint ne omnia fidei and vitae Christianae dogmata ad salute^ necessaria in
sacris literis perspicue conscripta. Whether all the Doctrines which concern
faith and manners, being necessary to Salvation, are plainly set down in
Scripture: for Illud affirmamus cum sanctis Chrysostom. and August. We affirm
so much with S. Chrysostom and S. Austin, says he.

6 The Papists in some Countries absolutely forbid the g Azorius inslit. Moral.

some, they forbid only such to read Bibles Catholikely translated, who have
not express Licenses under the hands of the Ordinaries to read them. In no
place will they permit every man indifferently to read the Scriptures in their
Mothers Tongue, as we do. Now that S. Austin is of our opinion it is plain:
so, Eo mihi venerabilior and sacrosancta fide dignior apparebat i 1 Confess.
lib. 6 cap. 5.
authoritas (Scripturae) quo omnibus ad legendum esset in promptu, verbis
aptissimis and humilimo genere loquendi se cunctis praebens, etc. I reverenced
and held the Scriptures worthy of so much the more credit, by how much the more
I saw them readier for every man to read, and that they framed themselves to
every man's capacity by the plainnes of the words, and the familia^nesse of the
Style, says S. Austin. And Jn Psalm 33. Sect. ^. post medium.
Legite Scripturas: ideo voluit Deus vt scriberentur, vt nos conso^aremur. Read
(^aith he, speaking out of the Pulpit to his Auditors) the Scriptures; for it
was Gods will they should be written, that we might receive comfort by them
says the same man.

6 The Bell lib. 4. de Verbi Dei cap. 4
P pists think it a worthy question, How Scripture may be known to be Scripture
We upon diverse good considerations think it an idle question. And so did
Confess. lib. 6. cap. 5.
S. Austin: for Persuasisti mihi non audiendos esse, si qui forte mihid^cerent,
vnde scis illos libros (Scripturae) vnius very and veracissimi dei spiritu esse
humano genert ministratos. Thou (O God) did persuade me they d served not so
much as hearing, who did ask of me, how know thou that the Books of holy
Scripture were given unto the Church by Gods appointment.

Bell. lib. 4 de Notis Ecclesie cap. 4. etc.
7 Then Papists teach, that the true Church may be known by Antiquity,
Universality, unity, etc. but not by the Scriptures only infallibly. We say
it may be known by the o De Vnitate Eccles. cap. 2.
Scriptures only. And in this S. Austine is as clear on our side as M. Calvin:
for, Inter nos and Donatistas quaestio est vbi sit Ecclesia, vtrum apud nos, an
apud illos. It is a question between the Donatists and us, (says he) where
the Church is; whether they or we have it. Quid ergo facturi sumus, in verbis
nostris eam quaesituri, an ^t verbis Capit is sui domini nostri Jesus Christi?
Puto quod in illius potius verbis ^am quaerere debeamns, qui veritas est, and
optimenouit corpus suum. What therefore shall we do? shall we seek for it in
our own words, or in the words of her own head our Lord Jesus Christ? I
think we ought to seek it rather in his word who is the truth, and best
knows his own body. And De Vnitate ^cclesi^ cap. 16.
afterward, Vtrum ipsi Ecclesiam tene^it, non nisi diuinarum Scripturarum
libris ostendant. If they be the Church, let them make proof thereof out of
the Canonical Books of Scripture only, says Saint Austin.

8 The Bell. lib. 4. de Notis Ecclesia cap. 14.
Papists teach, That by working of Miracles the Church may be discerned. But
we teach the contrary: And so did Saint De Vnitate Ecclesia ca. 16.
Austin. For he profess^th that though many Miracles had been done by man of
his Religion: though some of them had been Miraculouslie healed and cured: the
bodies of some Martyrs lying hid for many years discovered to Saint Ambrose,
an old^man well known to all the Jnhabitants of Millan, restored to his sight
upon touching of the Beer whereon those bodies were carried, which is reckoned
by ^ib. 2. de Reli^ cap. 3. Sect. 4 proba^ur.
Bellarmine as a special Miracle. Though some had seen Visions, some had been
rapt in spirit, and heard that either they should not join themselves with
Donatus, or that they should forsake Donatus: yet he and his follows desired
not (in regard thereof) to be believed they were the Church, concluding:
Quaecunque talia in Catholica fiunt, ideo sunt approbanda quia in Catholica
fiunt, non ideo ipsa manifestatur Catholica, quia haec in ea fiunt. Though all
such Miracles are to be approved of, because they are wrought in the Catholic
Church: yet the Church is not proved Catholic, because such Miracles are
wrought in it.

9 The Rh^m* (...)
Papists deny, That all the Actions of I^fidels are sin. Yet we say, they are
sins. And in this St. (...) 7 (...) 3. (...)
Austin is so apparently on our side that Papists are driven to conf^sse it.
For, Sine fide ^tiam quae videntur bona opera in peccata vertuntur. The works
which are done without Faith, though they seem good are turned into finne,
says Saint Austin in one place. And in To* (...)
another* Virtutes quas sibi animus habere videtur per quas imperat corpori and
vitijs ad quodlibet adipiscendum vel tenendum nisi ad Deum retulerit, etiam
ipsae potius vitia sunt qu^m virtutes. Nam licet a quibusdam tunc verae and
honestae putentur cum ad s^^psas referuntur, nec propter aliud expet^^ntur
etiam tunci^fl^tae and superbae sunt, and ideo non virtutes sed vitia
judicandae sunt. The virtues which the mind of him that knows not God seem
to have, by which she swaies the body and her vicious affections if they be
not referred to God, are indeed rather vices then virtues. For though some hold
them to be true and real virtues, when they are affected only for their own
sakes and nothing else, yet even so they are full of vanity and pride, and to
be adjudged vices and not virtues, says he. In which words, Tam aperte
virtutes has inter peccata numerat, vt nulla videntur tergiversatione alio
posse torqueri, says De Virtutibus imp^^rum, lib. 2. cap 5. Impress. Lou^^.
An. 1565.
Michael Bains, Professor of Divinity in Louaine. And Non sequenda illa opinio
est quam Tr^d. Conc. nuper merito damnauit; omnia Jnfidelium opera esse
peccata, quamuis maximum Authorem D. Augustinum habuisse videatur. We may not
defend that opinion which the Council of Trent did justly of late condemn:
viz. that all the actions of Infidels are sin, though the great Father Saint
Austin seems to have been of that opinion, says Comment in Math. 7. ^8.
Maldonat.

10 The Bell. de gra. and lib. Ar^it. I^b 5. cap. 9.
Papists teach, Some good works may be done by Infidels through the strength
of nature only. We say nay. And for proof of our Negative in this we
allege b To. ^. Epistola 106.
Saint Austin, who speaking of the Heretic Peligius, writes thus: Jnterdum it
a paribus moment is potestatem voluntat is aequa lance perpendit, vt
aliquantulum etiam ad non peccandum valere definiat. Quod si it a est, nullus
locus adiutorio gratiae reseruatur, sine qua nos dicimus, ad non peccandum
nihil voluntatis arbitrium habere. He weighs sometimes the power of a man's
will in such an even pair of skales, as that he teaches it for truth, It is
able to do somewhat that may keep a man from sinning. Which if it be true,
he leaves nothing to the help of Gods grace. Without which, we say, a man's
free Will is of no power to keep a man from sinning. Upon which words, De
virtutibus imp^ rum, lib. 2. cap. 8.
Michael Baius above named Glozeth thus. Nos, inquit, Igitur Pelagiorum vox est,
potestatem testatem voluntatis aliquantulum ad non peccandum valere:
Christianorum vero professio est, sine adiutori^ gratiae ad non peccandum ^ihil
valere voluntatis arbitrium.

12 The Sea Rhem Anno* in Romans 1.* 2. and Az^rius Jns^it. Moral. part 1 lib. 4.
lib. 4. cap. 8. 6 quaeritur. etc.
Papists teach, That some sins are venial and pardonable of their own
nature, such, for which God cannot in Justice keep a man out of heaven, and
adiudge him to the second death. But we teach contrary. And so did Saint
Austin, as De Meritis operum lib. 2. ^. 8
Baius the Professor of Divinity at Louaine acknowledges: yea and Adu^r^ent
in To 9 Aug. ^d 3. quaes^tn^ p. 19^*
Ferdinandus Velosillus also. For he having observed how Trast. ^1. (...) Io^.
Austin writes, That Minuta plura peccata si negliguntur, occidunt. Many little
sins (the Papists call them Venial) if men be careless of them, kill the
soul: delivering his opinion of the Words, says thus. Pro Augustino
respondemus, quod quando dicit, Quod plura peccata minuta, si negliguntur h
L^co ^ita^^
occidunt: agebat vicem co^cionatoris, qui vt populum a peccatis retrahant,
grauitatem delictorum exaggerantes, in odium delicti, saepe excedunt. To Austin
I answer, that when he spoke such words, he spoke them as a Preacher, who in
hatred of sin, and out of a desire to affright men from sin, do sometimes
so exaggerate the greeuousnesse of sin that they speak over.

12 The Azorius Justi^, Moral. part. ^. lib. 4. cap. 33. 1. quaeritur, page 302.
Papists teach, That Poena damni, not Poena sensus, is due to Original sin.
Wherefore they generally teach, That Children dying in Original sin, are
punished only with Poena damni, but not with Poena sensus. But we say, That
such child^en as die in Original sin are punished with Poena sensus, and not
with Poena damni only. For in our opinion, Poena sensus, and not Poena damni
only, is due to Original sin. And of our opinion Saint Austin was. For (to
omit what is written, To. 3. operum Augusti de fide ad Pel. Cap. 27. and To.
10. de verb. Apostoli Sermon. 13. and 14. and To. 7. Hypognosticon Lib. 5. which
sound so fully, that the Jesuit Azorius had no way to elude the testimonies,
but by the denying some of the Books to be Saint Austins, and by making doubt
of other some) in a known and an approved work of his, (...) ad (...) 91
he writes thus. Quicunque ab illa perditionis massa quae facta est per hominem
primum non liberantur per vnum Mediatorem Dei and hominem, resurgent quidem
etiam ipsi vnusquisque cum sua carne: sed vt cum Diabolo and Angelis eius
puniantur. Whosoever they be that are not delivered from that Mass of
corruption, which was caused by Adam, through the means of that our Mediator
between God and man, every of them shall rise again in their own flesh, yet
to that end they may be punished with the Devil and his Angels Which last
words to be punished with the Devil and his angels, imply necessarily Poenam
sensus.

13 The Papists teach, That our works are meritorious, and the very cause of
Salvation. But we say, they are not. In this St. In Psalm. 102.
Austin is so plain on our side, saying, Coronat te, quia dona sua coronat,
non merita tua. He Crowns thee because he crowns his gifts, not thy merits:
that In his former part of his Reformation of a Catholic deformed. Page 97.
Bishop the Prieft denies there is any such saying in Saint Austin as this is.
Saint Austin was too wise to let any such foolish sentence to pass his pen,
says Bishop.

14 The Con. rid sess. 7. de Sacram. in gevere, Can. 1.
Papists teach, That there are seven Sacraments of the Church, truly and
properly so called; and neither mo, nor fewer. We teach, that in true and
proper sense, there are only two Sacraments of the Church; neither mo, nor
fewer. Now that S. Austin is of our opinion herein, his words show: for in
Tract. 15. in Job. 2.
one place he affirms, that de latere Christi in cruce pendentis lancea
percusso, Sacramenta Ecclesiae profluxerent: when Christ's side was pierced with
a Spear, the Sacraments of the Church issued thereout. And in an De Symb: ad
Catachum. c. 6.
other, that percussum est latus, and statim manarunt sanguis and aqua, quae
sunt Ecclesiae geminae Sacramenta. Christ's side was pierced, and immediately
there gushed out both blood and water, which are the two Sacraments of the
Church. He meaning, the Lords Supper, by blood; by water, Baptism.

The Bell. Lib. 1. de Bapt. Cap. 7.
Papists teach, That Women ^ay Baptize. And we teach the contrary. Now that S.
Austin was of our opinion herein, it is plain by this; That in Can. 100.
the fourth Council at Carthage, whereunto he subscribed, it was absolutely
decreed, Mulier baptizare ne praesumat. Let not women baptize, and not with
limitation, as De conse^r^^. d. 4. c. Muli^r.
Gratian, and Lib. ^. sent. ^. 6. A.
Lombard corruptly cite it, Mulier baptizare ne praesumat nisi necessitate
cogente. Let not Women baptize, except in cases of necessity.

16 The Rhem. Annot. in ^ Cor. 11. 20.
Papists teach, That S. Paul by the Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11. meant not the
Eucharist, and that most great Authors now are of that opinion. But we teach
the contrary. And notwithstanding Sine Scripture authoritate, sine veterum
patrum exemple, fine r^tt^ne, null^ i^ lici^. Maldonat Comment. in Math. 26. 26.
one of them would impudently face us down, that in calling the Eucharist by
the name of the Lords Supper, we are destitute of all proof out of Scripture,
and of all warrant from the ancient Fathers, and of all reason: yet Annal. To
1. ad ^n. 34. Nu. 45.
Cardinal Baronius witnesses with us, that, Idem esse manducare Coenam
Dominicam quod Eucharistiam sumere Epist. 118. cap 7 and lib. ^. c. 7. de ser.
d^. in mont^.
Augustinus demonstrat. Austin proves manifestly, to eat the Lords Supper and
to receive the Eucharist are both one, making this note (as it were) by the
way. Sic patres appellare consueuerunt institutionem sacratissimae
Eucharistiae. So the Fathers were wont to call the Eucharist. Over against
which in the Margent is set, Omnes qui interpretati sunt locum 1 Cor. 11. Even
all the Fathers which have written Commentaries upon 1 Cor. 11.

17 The A^len de Eu^^. sacrificio. c. 4. Br s^o Motive. 26.
Papists teach, That the Sacrament is their Lord and God. But we teach the
contrary. We say with S. Tract. 5^ i^ Job.
Austin, it is, Panis Domini, not Panis Dominus: The Bread of the Lord; but not
Bread, our Lord.

18 The Apud Gratian de Consecrat. d 2. Ego Be^engarius.
Papists forced Berengarius to swear by the blessed Trinity, that he believed;
Verum corpus and sanguinem Domininostri Jesus Christi fidelium dentibus atteri,
the true body and blood of our Savior Jesus Christ, is torn with Christian
men's teeth, when they receive the Sacrament: Yet we believe with e Apud
Gratian. de Consecrat. d. 2. vtrum sub figura.
S. Austin, that Christum vorari dentibus fas non est. It is not lawful for a
Christian to tear Christ with his teeth. Which belief is so contrary to that
of Berengarius, that the Gloss. in 2. d. de Consecrat. c. vtrum sub figura.
vers^ ^oca^i.
Glozer had no way to reconcile them, but was driven to confess, that
Berengarius hyperbolice loquutus est, and veritatem excessit, used an
Hyperbole, and spoke more then the truth.

19 The g Papists cannot brook to hear that our Savior saying: This is my
Body, meant, This is a sign of my Body. Yet we say his meaning was such. And
so does Contra Adiman^ium. ca. 12.
S. Austin: for, Non dubitauit Dominus dicere Hoc est corpus meum, cum signum
daret corporis sui. Our Lord did not doubt to say, This is my Body, when he
ga^e the sign of his Body, says S. Austin. With which words the Papists are
so troubled, ^este Torrensi in Confess. Augustint* na lib. 3. cap. 6. p 322.
that some of them have made question whether they were not heretofore patched
into S. Austins works, by some follower of Berengarius: and Hardings Answer
to M. (...) Chal. lenge. Act. 12. p. 1^4.
others have been forced to shift them off, under pretense that S. Austin in
fighting against the Manichees oftentimes uses not his own sense, but those
things, which by some means howsoever it were, might seem to give him
advantage then; so as he might put them to the worse.

20 The Rhem. Annot. in 1. Cor. 10. 3.
Papists affirm that it is an impudent forgery to write. that the Jews
received no less the truth and substance of Christ in their Sacraments, then
we do in ours: Yet we write and teach so. And so did S. De vtilitate
poenitentiae. ca. ^.
Austin: for Eundem cibum spiritualem manducauerunt. Quid est eundem, nisi quod
cum, quem etiam nos. The Apostle affirms (says S. Austin) that they (the
Jews) ate the same spiritual meat, what means he to say the same, but that
they ate that which we also eat? And a little after, Suffecerat vt diceret,
cibum spiritualem manducauerunt, eundem inquit, eundem non intelligo quomodo
intelligendum, nisi ^um, quem manducamus and nos. It had been sufficient to
have said, They ate spiritual meat; but he says more they ate the same. I
cannot tell how I should understand that word the same, except he mean they
ate the same, for that they ate the same which we do eat. And Tract. 26. in
Job.
in another place, Apostolum vndi. Hearken what the Apostle says, says S.
Austin. Omnes eandemescam spiritualem manducauerunt, spiritualem vtique candem,
nam corporalem alteram: quia illi, Manna: nos al^ud, spiritualem vero quam nos,
They all ate the same spiritual meat; mark, the same spiritual meat; for
they ate not the same corporal meat: they ate Manna, we eat another thing;
but they ate the same spiritual meat which we cate. Which words are so
significant and express for us, that Comment in Job. 6. 49. Col. 629.
Maldonate confesses, S. Austin was of our opinion; though yet in his
persuasion, if Austin had lived in our days, he would have been of another
opinion: for, Hoc dico, (says the Jesuit) persuasum me habere D. Augustinum,
si nostra suisset aetate, long aliter sensurum. You must think he wanted a
Jesuit to inform him better.

21 The Bell. lib 3. de ^ucha cap 2^.
Papists teach, That Accidents remains in the Sacrament without subjects, And we
teach contrary. Now if the Book Soliloqu^orum be Saint Austins, as De
Script* Eccles: verb Augusti^.
Bellarmine says it is* Saint Austin is ours in this. For thus that Soliloq
lib* 2. Cap. 12.
Author writes therein. Quis concesserit, aut cui posse fieri videatur, vt id
quod in subiecto est, maneat, ipso intereunte subiecto? Monstruosum enim and a
veritate alienissimum est, vt id quod non esset, nis^ in ipso esset, ettam cum
ipsum non fuerit, pos^it esse. Who can grant, or to whom can it seem probable,
that that which is in a subject should remain when the subject is destroyed?
It is monstrous and far from all show of truth, that that which should have
no being, unless it were in such a subject, should have a being, even when
that subject has no being.

22 The Allan. de Euch. Sacrifici^, cap. 10. and 1^.
Papists at this day teach, That the Sacrifice offered in the Communion, or
Mass, as they call it, is a very Sovereign, true, and proper Sacrifice:
meaning thereby, That Christ is killed there indeed, and sacrificed to God. But
we say, That therein there is only made a Commemoration* of the true, and
sovereign, and proper Sacrifice of the Cross, and not an Oblation of the true
and sovereign proper sacrifice it self. And with us stands t Lib. 1. contra
Aduersar. Legis and Pr^p^et cap. 18.
Saint Austin: For first, In singulari and solo vere sacrificio pro nobis
Christi sanguis effusus est. That is the only true and sovereign sacrifice,
wherein Christ's blood was shed for us, says Saint Austin. u Lib. 20. cap. 21
co^t. F^^stum Manich.
Now in the Communion or Mass, no blood is shed. Secondly, Huius Sacrificij
Caro and Sanguis ante aduentum Christi, per victimas similitudinum
promittebatur, in passione Christi per ipsam veritatem reddebatur: Post
ascensum Christi, per Sacramentum memoria celebratur. The flesh and blood of
the Sacrifice of Christ, was promised by Sacrifices of resemblance before he
came, was performed in truth and deed when he suffered: is celebrated by a
Sacrament of remembrance, (mark, a Sacrament of remembrance) since he
ascended, says the same S. Austin, in another place. In which he is so
constant and so plain, that Lib. 4. sent. d. 12. G.
Peter Lombard, Master of the Sentences, proposing this question. Si quod
gerit Sacerdos proprie dicatur sacrificium vel immolatio. Whether that which
the Priest does execute be properly called a Sacrifice or an oblation,
resolves it is not, saying; Ad hoc breniter dici potest, illud quod affertur
and consecratur a sacerdote: vocari sacrificium, and oblationem, quia memoria
est and repraesentatio very sacrificii, and sunctae immolationis factae in ara
Crucis. To this I answer briefly, That that which is offered and consecrated by
the Priest, is called a Sacrifice and an offering, because it is a remembrance
and representation of the true Sacrifice and holy Offering made on the Altar of
the Cross, grounding his conclusion upon other testimonies in Ju Psalm. ^1. in
Prefat, Exposit. 2. and Epis^ (...) ^d Bonifaci^m.
S. Austin, and in S. Chrysostom.

z Hom. 17. in Heb.
24 The ^ Papists teach, That the body of our Lord may be in millions of
places a t one time; even in ^uery place where there is a Priest which
consecrates, and in every host (be they never so many) which is consecrated by
any Priest. But we teach contrary. And so did S. Tract. 30. in Job.*
Austin: for he intending to show the difference between Christ's body and his
truth, viz. his word: and that in respect of the places where they might be
found. Donec saeculum finietur sursum est dominus; s^d^tiam tamen hic nobis^um
est veritas domini. Corpus enim domini in quo resurrexit in vno loco esse In
the printed C^pies which I have seen, for Domini, is read Dominus, and for
oportet, p^test. But Algerus de Sacram. c. 14. Lombard in 4. sent. d. 10. Great.
d^ Consec. d. 2. c. prima quidem* Read as I have cit^d it*
oportet, veritas autem eius vbique diffusa est. Till Doomes-day, says he,
our Lord is above; yet the truth of the Lord is with us; for our Lords body in
which he arose from the dead, must be in one place, but his truth is in every
place.

24 The R^em. Annot. in ^ cor. 11* ^7.
Papists teach, That evil men even Infidels: yea, brute beasts may eat and
drink the Body and Blood of Christ. But we say, Nay. Now Saint Augustine
speaks plainly for us. For, Ipse (Christus) dicens, Qui manducat carnem meam,
and bibit sanguinem meum, in me manet, and ego in eo: ostendit quid sit non
Sacr^mento tenus, sed revera Corpus Christi manducare, and eius sanguinem
bibere: hec est enim in Christo manner, vt in illo maneat and Christus, sic
enim hoc dixit, tanqu^m diceret. Qui non in me manet, and in quo ego non maneo,
non se dicat, aut existimet manducare Corpus meum aut bibere Sanguin^m meum. d
D^ Cini^a^. ^ei. Lib. 21. c. 25
When Christ said (says Saint Augustine) He that eats my flesh, and
drinks my blood, dwells in me and I in him: he showed what it is, to
receive Christ (not Sacramentally merely, but) truly: even to dwell in
Christ, that Christ may also dwell in him. For when he said this, it was as
much as if he had said: He that dwells not in me, nor I in him, let him not
say, nor think that he eats my flesh or drinks my blood.

26 The Papists at Rome teach, That the Pope is in authority above a General
Council. But we teach the contrary. And so did Saint Augustine. For he
putting the case, that Melchiades Bishop of Rome, and certain other Bishops
sitting in Commission with him (by the Emperors commandment) upon a
Controversy between the Donatists and Caecilian, had done the Donatists wrong
in giving sentence against them and for Caecilian. Restabat adhuc plenarium ^
To. 2. (...) 162.
Eccles^ae vniuersae concilium, vbi etiam cum ipsis iudioibus causa posset
agitari, vt si male indicasse conu^cti essent, ^orum sententiae soluerentur.
There remained (says he) a further help for them, even a general Council,
in which they might have argued the case with the Commissioners appointed to be
their Judges: and procured reuersement of their judgment, upon proof they had
judged unjustly. Which words are so pregnant for our position, that De
Con^^rdant. Cathol* lib 2. cap 17. Aeneas Syluius Comment. de gest Pas. l.
Council l. ^.
Cardinal Cusan, and diverse other Papists allege them for proof of the same
conclusion.

27 The 2. q. 6. ad To, Eccles^a^.
Papists teach, That any man who thinks himself ^ronged, may appeal to Rome.
But we teach, they should not* Now that S. Austin was of our opinion it is
plain. For he was one at the Council of Milenis, wherein it was decreed, That
if any Elder or Deacon, or Clergy man of inferior state, appealed over Sea
(meaning to the Pope) no man in Africa should communicate with him. The words
of the Can. 22.
Canon running thus: Placuit vt Presbyteri, diaconi, vel caeteri inferiores
Clerici in causis quas habuerint, vicini Episcopi eos audiant, and inter eos
quicquid est finiant etc. quod si ab eis prouocandum putauerint, non prouocent
nisi ad Africana Concilia, vel ad primatus prouinciarum suarum. Ad transmarina
autem qui putauerint appellandum, a nullo intra Africam in communionem
suscipiantur. Which words sound so fully for us, and against the Papists, that
though C. 11. q. 3 pr^sbyter.
Gracian in one place cite^ them simply and truly as they are in several
editions of the Councels: yet in Cap. 2. q placuit (...) presbyte^^.
another place* he patcheth to them certain words of his own, viz. nisi forte
Romanam sedem appellauerint, unless perhaps they appeal to Rome, indeuouring
thereby to make the world believe, that S. Austin and his Colleagues allowed of
Appeals to Rome, and denied them to other places only. Whereas (by the
confession of Scholys in Synod. Cart^ag. Can. 31.
Theodorus Balsamon, yea of Lib. 2 de To. pont. c. 24.
Bellarmine) that Canon was especially made to restrain appeals of Elders and
Deacons to Rome.

28 The Cap. 2. q. 6. omnes Fpiscop^.
Papists teach That all Bishops may (doubtless) appeal to Rome. But we deny
this also. And no question, but S. Austin denied it in his time: for in the
Canon above cited, to which he subscribed, we Synod. Carthag. Genti^no Herueto
Interpret. Can. 31. impres. Paris. 1561. page 327.
read, that the Bishops professed, what they decreed then touching the
restraining of Elders and Deacons, etc. from appealing to Rome: the same, De
Episcopis sape definitum est, they had often decreed touching Bishops. In S.
Austins opinion, it was no more lawful for Bishops, then for the inferior
Clergy, to appeal to Rome.

29 The Papists teach, That the Pope may absolve such from Excommunication as
are excommunicated by others. But we teach, he cannot. Now that S. Con^.
African. cap. 105.
Austin was of our mind in this, it is plain. For, He, with others, in their
Epistle to Pope Caelestin, charge him with Quod minime licuit.
doing that which he ought not to have done: in that he restored Apiarius unto
the Communion, whom they had restrained therefrom; entreating him he would no
more In Communionem recipere.
absolve such as were excommunicated by them, alleging this as a reason, viz.
Hoc in Nicaena Synodo definitum, etc. It was agreed upon in the Council of
Ca^. 5.
Nice, Qui ab alijs abiecti, ab alijs non admittendi. Such as were
excommunicated by one, should not be absolved by another.

30 The Mosconius de maiestate Militantis Ecclesiae lib. 1. de Cardinal. Cap. 6.
Papists teach, That the Pope may send his Legates into Provinces afar off to
decide Controversies among the Clergy. We teach, he might do better to keep
them at home. And that S. Austin was of our opinion it is clear by the Epistle
above cited, which he and other Bishops writ to Pope Caelestin: for therein,
having signified unto him, they could notfind it decreed by any Council that
he should send any Legates into other Countries; they desire him in that respect
to send no such Legates, intimating unto him, that it smelt of pride and
smoking stateliness in the world. With which speeches of his, and his fellow
Bishops, the Papists v Relect. princip. fidei doctrinai. cont. 3 q. 7. ad 1
Arg. page 412. and 413.
are wonderfully offended. u Stapleton says, It is manifest falsum, a stark
lie, that no such decree is to be found in any Council. Hic a crassaignorantia
excusari vix possunt. In this, S. Austin and his fellow Bishops can hardly be
excused from gross ignorance. And whereas they said, such sending of Legates
smelt of worldly pride, temere prolatum fuisse manifestum est, It is evident
they spoke rashly, says the same Stapleton.

31 The Papists grant, that Provincial Councels may err: but they will not
grant that their Pope can err. But we say, that in as much as Provincial
Councels are subject to erring, no doubt their Pope is subject to erring.
Wherein S. Austin concurreth in opinion with us. For He, and his fellow Bishops
in their Epistle to Caelestin, thought it absurd, that any man should imagine
God would inspire the trial of right into one man, and deny it to a great
number of Bishops assembled in a Council. Which makes so fully for our
assertion, that Lib. ^upra citat. ad 3 Ar^. p. 413.
Stapleton says bluntly, Non est absurdum quod illi Africani absurdum
existimauerunt. It is not absurd which the Fathers of Africa thought absurd.
And, Non necessario tenemur credere quicquid Episcopi illi dicunt -- praesertim
cum satis apparet -- eos modum in verbis nonnihil excessisse. We are not of
necessity to believe whatsoever those Bishops spoke, considering it is plain,
they ouershot themselves much in their words, says Lib. 4. de R^. pont. cap. 7.
Bellarmine.

32 The Turre^remat. s^mm. de Ecclesia, lib. (...) cap. 58.
Papists teach, that a general Council cannot err in matters of faith. But we
say the contrary. Now S. Austin disputing against the Donatists about a point
of faith, viz. whether such as were baptized by Heretics and Schismatickes
were rightly baptized: and being pressed by the Donatists with a Decree of a
Provincial Council, held by Cyprian, in which it was affirmed, that such as
were baptized by Heretics or Schismatics were not rightly baptized: he falls
into a singular commendation of Scripture, preferring it before all writings of
the Fathers, either single, or assembled in Councels, Lib. 2. de ^ap. cont.
Do^at. cap 3.
showing that the single writings of the Fathers may be corrected by Councels:
Provincial Councels by general Councels: and that even general Councels
themselves may often be amended, the former by the later, when by some
experience of things, that is opened which before was shut, and that known
which before was unknown. Which argues, S. Austin was of our opinion, That a
general Council may err in a matter of faith.

33 The Lindax. Panop. lib. 4. cap. 89.
Papists say, that the first Nicen Council made 80 Canons. We say, they made
but 20. Now that S. Austin was of our opinion herein, it appears by this, That
he and his fellow Bishops in the Cap. 9.
sixth Council at Carthage, and Ca^. 102.
the African, acknowledged no more then 20. He and his fellow Bishops held, that
the copies of the Nicen Canons which were sent them from Alexandria and
Constantinople, in which there were 20 Canons only, were the truest copies.
For this testimony is so evident, that the Papists have no way to avoid it
handsomely, but are driven to say rudely, Stapleton Relect. Controu. 3. q. 7.
ad 1 Arg. page 412.
Non debuerunt patres Africans haec exemplaria pro verissimis venditare: The
Fathers of Africa ought not to have accounted these copies (sent them from
Alexandria and Constantinople) the truest copies.

34 The Bell. l. 1. de sanct. beatit. c. 20. Rhem. Annot. in Romans 10. 14.
Papists teach, That we may believe in Saints: And we teach the contrary. Now
so did S. Austin Tract. 29. in Job.
: for Credimus Paulo, sed non credimus in Paulum: credimus Petro, sed non
credimus in Petrum. We believe (says he) S. Paul, but we believe not in S.
Paul. We believe S. Peter, but we believe not in S. Peter.

35 The Velosillus Aduert. in To. 6. Aug. ad 5. Quaesitum p. 439. Lo^^ius
Mariae August^. l. 4. cap. 1. (...) 337.
Papists approve of the erection of Altars unto Saints, which we do not, nor
Co^t. Faustum Man^. ^ lio. 20. cap. 21.
S. Austin, for Nulls martyrum, sed ipsi Deo martyrum constituimus altaria. We
build Altars to him who is the God of Martyrs, but not to any of the Martyrs,
says S. Austin.

36 The Lo^rius Ma^i^ Augustae l. 4. (...) 26
Papists teach, That Temples may be built to Saints: But we teach, that Temples,
or Churches as we call them, should be built to God only. So did Lib. 1. cont.
Ma^imin. Arianum Episcopum.
Austin, for N^nne si templum alt^m sanct^ Angelo excellentissimo de liguis et
l^pidibus saceremus, anathematizaremur a veritate Christi, and ab Ecclesia dei,
quoniam creature exhibiremus eam seruitutem quae vni tantum debetur Deo? If we
should build a Church of Wood and Stone to one of the chiefest Angels, should
we not be anathematized of Christ and of his Church, says S. Austin, seeing
in doing so we should give that honor unto a creature, which is due only unto
the Creator? Which words are so contrary to the Popish practice of building
Churches to Saints (which practice of building proceeds from their opinion of
the lawfulness thereof) that In ^dit, Aug. anno 1562.
Erasmus set this Note over against them in the margent, Hoe nunc fit
quibuslibet diuis: intimating, that howeuer Austin thought it idolatrous to
build Churches to the chiefest Angels, yet now there were Churches built to
every of the Saints. With which his free confession, it tending to the shame of
Popery, the Deleantur illa verba, Ho^ nunc fit quibuslibet d^uis. Index Hispo:
fol. 5. b.
Papists are so much offended, that in their Purgatory Iudices, direction is
given, that his words be blotted our.

37 The Bernardinus de Bustiin Mariali part. 10. sect. 2. de gaudiis Maria
part. 5.
Papists teach, That our Savior Christ after the resurrection did first appear
unto his mother, assuring themselves, Baron. Annal, To. 1. ad An. 34. Nu 183.
Nemo pius negarit, No honest man will deny it. Yet we deny it; and so does
Saint Austin: For speaking thereof, In Psalm. 58. in expos. 1. part.
Maria Magdalenae dignatus est primitus apparere; Christ (says he) vouchsafed
to appear first unto Mary Magdalen.

38 The Bell. lib. 3. de Cultu sanct. cap. 16. ad 2.
Papists generally teach at this day, That the Virgin Mary was not conceived in
origina^^ sin. And we teach the contrary. Now that these words of De nuptiis
and concupiscent. cap. 24.
Austin, Quaecunque nascitur proles (ex concupiscentiae carnis) originali
obligata est peccato: Whatsoever child is borne, by concupiscence of the flesh,
the same is infected with original sin; prove that the Virgin Mary was
conceived in sin, it is confessed by See Pel. de Vincentia de B. virg.
concept. ducentorum and sexdecem sanctae matris Ecclesiae doctorum, vera, tuta,
and tenenda sententia.
diverse Papists. And by the same men it is confessed in like manner, that the
same conclusion is proved by these words: De fide ad Petrum. cap. 26.
Firmissime tene, and nullatenus dubites, omnem hominem, qui per concubitum
viri and mulieris concipitur, cum peccato original nasci: Believe thou this
for a certain truth, that whosoever is gotten by conjunction of man and woman,
he or she is borne with original sin.

39 The Azorius insiit, Moral. part. 2. lib. 1. c. 19. 2. quaeritur.
Papists teach, Fide Catholica creds deiparam semper virginem in sanctitate
natam esse: That it is one point of the Catholic faith, to believe that the
Virgin Mary was holy even when she was borne. But we think not so. Neither did
Saint Austin think so. For, Fieri nullo modo potest, vt quis renascatur,
antequam nascatur: It cannot be possibly ( Epist. 57.
says Austin) that a man should be borne again, before he be borne: which
sentence does so distaste the Jesuit Vasquez. that To 2. in 3. part. Tho q. 27.
Art. 2 disput. 115. cap. 4
he professes; Nulli Catholicorum ita licet opinari. No Catholic may think so.

40 The Co^^. Tri^. sess. 6. ^. 13.
Papists teach, that Exspeciali Dei priuilegio, By an especial privilege
granted by God, the Virgin Mary was freed from all sin. them. annot. in Mare.
3. 33.
She had so much grace given her, that she never sinned so much as venially.
But we teach the contrary: and so (doubtless:) did Saint Austin. For speaking
of Christ, Nullus est hominum praeter ipsum qui peccatum non fece^ it
grandioris aetatis accessu, quia nullus est hominum praeter ipsum qui peccatum
non habuerit infantilis aetatis exortu: There was never any man but Christ
(says Lib. 5. con. litli^^um. cap 9.
Saint Austin) who sinned not in his elder years, because no man but Christ was
free from sin in his infancy. And in another place, discoursing upon the
words, John 2. 4. Woman, what have I to do with thee? he Lib. 2. de Symb. ad
Cate. hum. cap. 5.
brings in our Savior saying unto her thus, Non competit tibi vt iubeas Deo;
competit autem vt subdita sis Deo: It becomes thee not to command God; it
becomes thee to be subject unto God: Which words argue that he reproved her;
and by consequence, that she made some fault. For, Vbi nulla culpa est, nec
reprehensio, aut increpatio locum habet: Where no fault is committed, no check
or reproof should be used: as Comment. in Job 2 Annot. 5.
Cardinal Tolet observes.

41 The Bell. lib. 2. de imag. cap. 8.
Papists teach, That it is lawful to represent God in the image of an old man.
And we teach the contrary; and so did Saint. Austin. For speaking of their
sacrilege, who turned the glory of the incorruptible God, into the similitude
of a corruptible man, Nefas est collocare tale simulachrum Deo: It is a foul
fault to express God in such an image, says T^. 3. de side and symb. cap. 7.
Saint Austin.

42 As the Papists allow of representing God in the image of an old man, so
they allow of the worshipping of such images. For Comment. in 3. part Tho. q.
25. Art. 3. page 139. Edit. Ste^s. Anno 1567.
Caietan speaking of the images of God, and of Christ, etc. Hac non solum
pinguntur, vt ostendantur (sicut Cherubin olim in Templo) sed vt adorentur, vt
frequens vsus Ecclesia testatur: These images (says he) are made, not for show
(as the Cherubins in the Temple in times past) but to the end they may be
worshipped, as the usual practice of the Church shows. But we teach the
contrary; and so did Saint Austin. For, Nulla imago Dei coli debet ^isi illa,
quae hoc est vt ipse: No image of God may be worshipped ( To. 2. epistola 119.
ad Ianuari. um. cap. 11.
says he) but that which is all one with himself, meaning Christ Jesus:
Colos. 1. 15. and Heb. 1. 3.

43 The Naclantus en. irrat. in Epist. Pauli ad To. c. 1.
Papists teach, That the images of Saints may be worshipped even with that
worship which is due to the Saint himself, dulia, hyperdulia. But we teach the
contrary; and so (it seems) did To. 1. de morib. Eccl. Cathol. lib. 1. c. 34.
Saint Austin. For he speaking of superstitious and evil lived Christians who
lived in the Church, whom the Church disliked much, and labored to reclaim;
comprehends amany of them under picturarum adoratores, worshippers of Images:
which touches the Papists so near the quick, that Lib. 2. de imag. cap. 16.
Bellarmines best answer is, Aug: scripsisse eum librum in primordijs
conuersionis suae ad fidem Catholicam, etc. Saint Austin writ that book
alleged, presently after his conversion to Christianity, at what time he
thought many customs to be idolatrous, which upon better information he held
tolerable.

44 The Papists teach, That Images are laymens books. And we teach, they are
not. Now there is no question but Saint Austin was of our opinion. For he To.
4. de Consens. Eua^g. lib. 1. cap. 10.
speaking of some who imagined, contrary to Scripture, that Saint Paul was one
of our Savior Christ's best beloved Disciples in his life time: because they
had seen him and Saint Peter pictured with our Savior upon some walls: Sic
omnino errare meruerunt qui Christum and Apostolos eius non insanctis
codicibus, sed in pictis parietibus quaesierunt: So they deserved to err
(says he) who sought for Christ and his Apostles upon painted walls, and not in
the Bible.

45 The Baron. Annal. To. 1. ad An. 44. Nu. 39. ND. 3. Conuers. part. 1. Cap.
1. Nu. 26.
Papists teach, That Africa had her Religion from Rome. Which we believe not.
Because To. 2. ep. 170.
Saint Austin says in express words, Ab orientalibus Ecclesus Euangelium in
Africam venit; The Gospel came into Africa from the Greek Church.

46 The Papists teach, Men may dine on a fasting-day: but so do not we, nor S.
Austin, for he Epistol 186. ad Casidanum.
disputing about Saturday fast, makes a plain opposition between dyning and
fasting; giving us to understand (which is confessed by L b. 2. de bonis
operib. in per. tic. cap. 2.
Bellarmine) that he who dynes fasts not, he who fasts dynes not.

47 The Vincent. Bruns in his Treatise of Penance. Chap. 10.
Papists teach, It is a sin against the first Commandment, to dissuade or
hinder any from entering Religion: that is, according to their language, from
being a Monk or a Nun. But we think not so, neither did S. Austin think
so: for it is cenfessed by De continen. tia lib. 4. cap. 8. page 465.
Claudius Espencaeus, that in his 70 Epistle. A Monachisms vote Bonifacium
reuocauit. He dissuaded Earl Boniface from Monkery, which (questionless) he
would never have done, if he had been minded as the Papists, That to dissuade a
man from Monkery, had been a sin against the first Commandment.

48 The Bell. lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 30. and 34
Papists teach, A man may live chastely, and yet play the fornicator; for
fornication preiudiceth not the popish vow of chastity: But we teach the
contrary, and so did S. Austin: for, Ad castitatem pertinet, non fornicari, non
maechari, nullo illicito concubitu maculari; He that would live chastely, must
neither play the Fornicator, nor the adulterer, nor defile himself by any
unlawful copulation Tom. ^. lib. de bono coningali cap. 22. prope sinem.
says S. Austin.

49 The Papists teach, That neither Monks nor Clergymen may live with their
wines like married men. And iure quo nunc vtimur, Religiosus professus dominij
and proprietatis capax non est. By the law which now stands in force, No Monk
has right or propriety in goods, Iustitut. Moral. part. 1. lib. 12. cap. 6. 4.
quaritur.
says Azorius: Yet we teach the contrary. And so did Tom. 6. de Haeres. c. 40.
S. Austin, for he finds fault with the heretics called Apostolici, eo quod in
suam communionem non reciperent vtentes coniugibus, and res proprias
possidentes, quales habet Ecclesia Catholica and Monachos and Cleric^s
plurimos: for that they would not receive into communion with them such as
lived with their wives like married men, and had propriety in goods: Whereas
there were many Monks and Clergymen in the Catholic Church, who lived with
their wives like married men, and had propriety in goods. To which De
Continentia lib. 5. cap. 8. page 648.
Espencaeus knows not what to say, save that in many other places S. Austin
says the contrary. And seeing that vna aut altera hyrundo non facit ver. One
or two Swallows make not Summer, there is no reason to believe this single
testimony, before so many other to the contrary.

50 The Gloss. in e. Quod vo^entes. c. 27. q. 1. apud Great. Bell. lib. 1. de
Matrimon. cap. 21.
Papists teach, That a simple vow; doubtless, a solemn vow, makes a nullity of
marriage: and we teach the contrary. And so did S. Austin: for speaking of that
argument, Qui dicu^t taliu^ nuptias non esse nuptias, sed potius adulteria, non
mihi videntur satis a^ute and diligenter considerare quid dicunt. They who say
such marriages are no marriages, but rather adulteries: in my opinion consider
not advisedly what they say, To. 4. de bono viduitatis, cap. 10.
says Austin: which testimony is so plain, that De votis Monasticis.
Smith, Reader of Divinity in Oxford, in Queen Mary's days, could shape no
better answer unto it, then this: viz. He would never have taught, that the
marriages of Votaries had been true marriages, but in opposition to Heretics,
of which some condemned second marriages, some all marriages. And To 2. disput.
de Matrimon. part. 3. q. 2. de 3. impedimento. id est, voto.
Maldonat the Jesuit was forced to confess (without pretending any such
excuse as that of Smithes) that S. Austin was flat of contrary opinion to them
in thus: for disputing the question, An votum solenne castitatis dirimat
Matrimonium quod postea contra^itur? having alleged diverse Fathers (among
whom, S. Austin was one) and Councels for the negative: coming to answer, Quod
attinet ad Argumentum ex testimonijs veterum Authorum; Non videtur mihi esse
negandum multos illorum in ea fuisse sententia vt existimarent per votum
solenne non dirimi matrimonium. Nam August: non tantum aperte dicit sed etia^
contendit, etc. To the Argument (says he) taken from the testimonies of the
ancient Writers, my answer is; That in my opinion, many of them thought a
solemn vow did not make a nullitie of marriage: for Austin does not only say
so much in plain terms, but he confidently auowes it for a certain truth,
etc.

51 The Bell. lib. 2. de pur gat. cap. 6.
Papists generally teach, That Lymbus puerorum, is a part of Hell, wherein
children are punished paena solius damni aeterna; distinct from that part of
Hell, wherein the Devil and his angels are punished, paena damni and sensus
aeterna. But we say this doctrine of theirs is not true. After this life there
is no place for any but either in heaven with Christ, or in Hell with the
Devil. And of this mind was S. Austin; for, Nec est vllus vlli medius locus
vt possit esse nisi cum diabolo, qui non est cum Christo. There is no third
place left for any, but he must needs be with the Devil, who is not with
Christ, To. 7. de de pecat. Merit. and Remiss. lib. 1. cap. 28. See de verb.
Apostoliser. 4. and lib. 5. Hypognostic.
says he: Wherein he is so constant, that De Sacrament. lib. 3. cap. 1.
Cardinal Contarenus speaking hereof, Hunc locum Augustinus in multis suorum
operum locis non videtur agnoscere. S. Austin (says he) in many of his Tomes
seems not to acknowledge any such place as Lymbus puerorum.

52 The Bell. lib. 2. de Purgat. cap. 6.
Papists reach, that Lymbus patrum, otherwise called Abrabams bosom, is a part
of Hell, wherein the holy Fathers, who dyed before Christ's passion, were
punished paenasolius damni temporali: which doctrine we dislike. And so did S.
Austin. For considering he read in Scripture, that there was a great Gulf
between the rich man in Hell, and Lazarus in Abraham's bosom, and he could
never find that the name of Hell was used in good part, in any part of
Scripture. he Epistola 57. and 99. and de Genesis ad literam lib.
concluded that Abraham's bosom, which is the same with that which Papists call
Limbus patrum, was (questionless) no part of Hell, for which he is reproved
by Comment in Act. 2. 24.
Lorinus a Jesuit.

53 The Dowists Annot. in 1 Samuel 28
Papises say, that it was Samuel himself who appeared to Saul, 1 Samuel 28. and
not some evil spirit which took his similitude. But we say the contrary: And
that S. Austin was of our opinion herein, it is confessed by Daemonomaniae lib.
2. ^. 3.
Bodin, who discoursing upon this point, acknowledges: Austin was one of them
who held hunc fuisse diabolum, that he who appeared to Saul was the Devil. And
as much is acknowledged by In Indica Rerum and vertorum operum Hieron. ad finem
To. 9. verbo Necromantia.
Marianus Victorius, in these words, Hier. tom. 4. falsum esse scribit,
Samuele^ a pythonissa illa muliere suscitatum cum potius visa fuerit idfecisse
quam fecerit: quod etiam Augustinus latius probat. S. Ierom in his 4 Tome
writes, it is false, that Samuel was raised by the Pythonist* for she rather
seemed to raise him, then indeed raised him. Which truth is proved more at
large by Austin. And, Augustinum magis inclinare in eam partem vt credatur non
vere spiritum Samuelis a suae requie excitatum fuisse, sed aliquod phantasma,
etc. That S. Austin inclined rather to think it was not indeed Samuel, but
some Hob-goblin that was raised, it is confessed Comment. in Eccl. c. 46.
by Iansenius.

54 The Bell. lib. 1. de To. Pont. c. 10.
Papists teach, That the Rock whereon our Savior promised to build his Church,
was S. Peter. But we say, it was Christ himself, and not Saint Peter. Now
that S. Austin is herein of our opinion it is plain by his own words: for
thus he De verbis Dominiser. 13.
writes, Tu es Petrus, and super hanc petram quam confessus es, super hanc
petram quam cognouisti (dicens tu es Christus Filius Dei viui) adificabo
Ecclesiam meam i. Super meipsum filium Dei viui adificabo Ecclesiam meam, super
me aedificabo te, non me super te, etc. Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock
which thou have confessed, upon this Rock which thou have known (saying, Thou
art Christ the Son of the living God) will I build my Church: that is, upon
my self the Son of the living God, will I build my Church, I will build thee
upon me, not me upon thee, etc. Which words found so fully, that our Annot. in
Man. 16. 18.
Rhemists best answer is, S. Austin examined not the nature of the original
words which Christ spoke, nor of the Greek. Lib. 1. de Romans Pont. c 10.
Bellarmins best answer is, Ex ignorantia linguae Hebraeae deceptum: Austin was
deceived for want of knowledge in the Hebrew. Hierarch. Eccl. lib. 3. 0. 5.
Pighius censure of Austin is, Nusquam haeret, nusquam figit pedem, sed vbique
explorat, vbique tentat, subodoratur omnia: and quicquid probabile occurrit,
alicubi amplectitur, quod continuo post displicet, and retractatur: He can
never resolve certainly upon any thing, but fetches about this way and that
way, and after that a third way: and at length lighting upon some probability,
he lays hold on that, yet dislikes it presently, and retracts it. Affirming
further, that S. Austin never expounded these words so, but O^iose secum
inquireatis and tenta^tis omnia.
when he was idleheaded, and given to crotchets. Concluding, it was Contorta
expositio, atque adeo ipsis verbis Christi manifest aduersaria: A forced
exposition, and quite contrary to Christ's words.

55 The Pig^. Hierarch. Eccl. lib. 3. cap. 9.
Papists teach, That the keys of the kingdom of heaven were given to Peter
only. But we say, that Peter represented the person of the Church, when Christ
said unto him, To thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And so
says S. Tract. 50. in Job.
Austin. For, Petrus quando claues accepit, Ecclesiam sanctam significauit,
When Peter received the keys, he represented the Church, says S. Austin.
Which speech so gawles the Papists, that thereupon Hierarch. Eccl. lib. 6. cap.
4. fol. 186.
Pighius breaks out into these words; De Augustino possem dicere, quod vnus
homo fuerit, hac in re nec secum firmiter, nec cum aliis consentiens. At patrum
sententiae tunc apud nos est praecipuae authoritas, quando and seeum, and cum
aliis consentientes, ipsam nobis explicant communem Orthodoxae Ecclesiae
sententiam. I may truly say of Austin, that he is the only man, who in this
point neither agrees constantly with himself, nor with others. Now we give
credit to the Fathers, when agreeing with themselves, and with other of their
fellows, they deliver unto us the common opinion of the Orthodoxall Church.

56 The Bell. lib. 2. de Monach. c 9. Maldonst. com. in Mat. 19. 20.
Papists say, That the young man who told our Savior Mat. 19. 20. that he had
kept all the commandments of God, spoke truly: but we say, he spoke untruly:
and so did S. Austin: For, Puto, quod se arrogantius, quam verius seruasse
responderat: I think he spoke more proudly then truly, Epi^. 89. 9. 4.
says S. Austin: which is confessed to be S. Austins opinion by Loco proxi^e
citato.
Maldonate.

57 The Bell. lib. 1. de Euc^ c. 11. (...) Man. (...)
Papists teach, That the words of Christ Mat. 26. 29. I will not drink
henceforth of this fruit of the vine, etc. are not to be understood of the
Sacramental cup, but of the ^asch^ll. We say the contrary. Now S. Austin is so
fully of our opinion, that (...).
Bellarmin turns him off with this answer, Di^o August: non expendisse hunc
locum diligenter, vt ex eo patet, quod breuissime se expedi^it ab hac
difficultate: Austin did not well consider of this text, which appears by this
that he passed it over briefly.

58 The Ioh. de Parisiis de potestate Regia and papali, cap. 3. Stapleton
Antidot. in Euang. Ioh. 10.
Papists teach, That the words John 10. 16. There shall be one flock, and one
shepherd, are not meant of Christ, but of the Pope. But we teach the contrary.
And so did S. Austin, Tract. 47. in Ioh. and Ser. 49. de verbis Domini.

59 Some Bar. Annal. To. 1 ad An. 51. Nu. 31.
Papists hold opinion, That in the controversy between S. Peter and S. Paul
mentioned Gal 2. Saint Peter did not minimum delinquere, sin so much as
venially: others Bell lib. 1. de. R^ Pont.
hold, perhaps he sinned venially. But we say he sinned grievously. And so did
S. Austin, For in him we read, that S. Peter Lib. 2. de Bapt. cont. Donat.
cap. 1
Contra regulam veritatis cogebat gentes Iudaicare: compelled the Gentiles
against the rule of faith to play the Jews. S. Peter, in simulatione^
superstitiosam, yea, De agone Christiano. cap. 30.
in prauam simulatione^ lapsus est; fell into superstitious and wicked
dissimulation. With which speeches of his Loco supra citato.
Baronius is so much offended, that he sticks not to say, S. Austin did therein
A linea Catholicae sides aberrare, and in lapidem offensionis incurrere, Swerue
from the Catholic faith, and stumble upon the stone of offense.

60 The Rhem. annot. in Heb. 11. 21.
Papists teach, That Jacob adored the top of his son Joseph's rod, Heb. 11. 21.
But we say Jacob worshipped not Joseph's rod, but that leaning upon his own
rod, by reason of his weakness, he adored God. Now that S. Austin so expounds
the place, our Loco citato.
Rhemists are forced to confess.

61 The Rhem. annot. in Heb. 13. 16.
Papists say, That the words Heb. 13. 16. should be translated, God is
promerited: we say, God is well pleased. Now that S. Austin is on our side, it
is witnessed by Lib. 10. 65.
Viues for in his Notes upon Austin de Ciuitate Dei, where the words Heb. 13.
16. are thus cited, placatur Deus, God is pacificed. In antiquis, placetur Deo,
vtrumque melius quam quo modo vulgo habemus, promeretur deus. In the ancient
copies (says he) we read, God is pleased, both readings being better then the
common reading, God is promerited.

62 The Allen. de Eue^* sacrificio. cap. 5.
Papists teach, That by the Incense mentioned Mal. 1. 7. is meant their
Sacrifice of the Mass. But we say, thereby is meant the prayers and praises of
the Saints. And Lib. 2. cont Ep. Petoliani cap. 89
S. Austin agrees so fully with us herein, that Inflit. moral. part. 1. lib.
10. cap. 11. 7. quae^^ur.
Azoriut best answer is, August: reliquem veterum patrum coetum opponimus, and
Synodi Tridentinae testimoniu^: We oppose against S. Austin the general
consent of other Fathers, and the testimony of the Council of Trent.

FINIS.
