Gentle Reader.
I Am not ignorant, that there belongs to Kings from their servants both
Tribute of duty, and presents of affection, elce it will appear a tacit denial
of any grace or bounty received from them; as for the former of these (I hope)
I shall not live to be wanting in my most humble duty, and the good pleasure of
his Majesty's employments; and for the latter (I conceave) the choice of this
subject might be an oblation much referring to the excellency of his individual
person. And were the form as Courtly as the matter, I could have had the
confidence, to crave the Patronage of the Highest borne Prince of the Christian
world, and a Person (without flattery) in whom all greatest Crowns
concentrate, though at present as highly beyond all Law of nature, or national
example, injured and traterously treated: which offers the cause of this may
republication, with a further enlargement of my former act, in the year 1638.
as being sensible of a vulgar misunderstanding of my intention in the
tractation of this subect, which was then, and is now, but an addition to our
medicinal faculty, and more exactly to declare, how, and after what manner the
juce of the Grape may be conducible to humane bodies, both for Aliment and
Medicament: which if those Lords and Commons that would suffer noe persons of
honor and loyalty to make with themselves the representative body of the whole
Kingdom, if those (I say) had accepted, it in my own sense, could not in such
a Noaical stupefaction, have slept out their Eyes of reason and sense of
honor, as to suffer their nakedness to be detected by the most common Robbers
of the English Nation, and themselves imprisoned for the same theft. If they
shall excuse themselves, and that such ebriety was not the cause, they can not
appear any other then the Tred of Dunghill-Cocks, for no spirit of the Game or
reasonable, could suffer or conceive, that the stoping up the fountain of
honor, could render the rivolets any other then stinking Ditches: if
otherwise such stupidity were conveyed in their base Principles of nature, it is
then a Gengrena in the mass of blood, and by noe other scope to be cured, but
by extirpation and replanting more noble and lively Roots in their room; If
any person shall adjudge this sharp Council to be more medicall, then
prudential, which term in this age is the perfect Character of a cheating and
treacherous villayne or knave, which formerly obtained a better signification,
let them know the consultor is more Medical then Prudential and well knowing
his faculty to be sufficiently comprehensive of all arts and sciences and
Politics, if either Aristotel or Machivel are esteemed Pollititians, and so
such as have been endowed with such perfection of intellect amongst the
Professors of this faculty, the Almighty has Crowned with a special title of
honor as has in many ages appeared by the studdys and practice of great
Kings, and has been the fountain of the whole famely de Medicis, so great at
this day: nor are there any (except the souls of Cornelius Agrippa) so vain,
as to render an undervallue of the faculty, or besmeere the Purple and Scarlet
Robes of the Physician Cum stircore and Vrina; were my self over zealous, by
its subject matter I could demonstrate it for Antiquity to precede the Form,
in that matter, which was by the Almighty after informed, and as soon as the
sex was distinguished it was Corpus humanum, vivens and sanabile, and instantly
the subject of that part of Physic which we call Diaetetical, as appears by
their necessity in eating of all manner of Aliment in Paradise by the order of
the Creator (except the Tree of Life) and not only for antiquity, but also for
its dignity of frame, about which the Almighty summoned a Council, and left
most justly from its own excellency, to challenge precedence of all other
subjects of sciences and arts (except Theology) which is subjected principally
in the form: it is also affirmed by the Orator in the 2 de natura Deorum, that
al Creatures are dedicated to its service: and Josephus will create it Lord of
al Terrestrialitie and the cause of al such production according to Pliny: As
for any larger Encomiastick I shall referr the Reader to Lactantius, and leave
Cornelius with his vanitles, to the prudentials of these times, which would
have all knowledge and virtue to consist in self confidence and such poor
Romantique learning as would enforce the ancient worthyes both of art and
courage to render a scornful blush to be seen amongst such butterflies, and to
see such unnatural and preposterous motion from perfection, to imperfection,
from rationality, to mere animality or contradictoriously; much resembling the
Duchy of Spoleto in the territory of Narina (which according to Pliny) is
exceeding dirty in a drought, and as dusty in wett weather, of such sort of
strange earth, were these Don Quixotes composed; and having nothing to encourage
their errant Knighthood but a poor lean Rozinante, or some glistering quoine
of their forefathers monuments which will not pass current with any (but weak
Capacities) for others that observe their digression from their Fathers
virtues, cannot but conceave them better to have been pist out against a
Windmill, then otherwise produced to the shame of their Genitors. If I shall
seem to much censorious, I shall earnestly desire a just cause of retraction,
which would be a Royal Cordial to all Princes and sweet Natures, which are
perpetually molested with such confident and insolent vermin, which will stop
the breach of any person that shall smell of honny (except they close their Lips
and Ears) against their entrance; If I have offended in my description of those
persons, it will be as difficult for me to recant, as for them to repent of
their Rebellion, which is correspondent to witchcraft, of which sin repented,
I could never meet with an example except (Manasses) therefore do conclude
their prudence to stand upon no other bottom, then the Diabolical attempt of
greater Crimes; for although they know and have seen the cclipscd beauty of
heaven break through such darkness, to the enlivening of all creatures again,
yet will be, and are still better enterteyned with such Egyptian darkness, though
measured by a short time, as most conducible to their black designs,
conceaving this bonum presens to be preferred bfore all notions of other
Beatitude, or productioon of right reason and nobleness of soul, which
demention, the heathen Poets have rendered a most certain symptom of
irrecoverable destruction, to which I leave them, and til then expect it; what
I have writ concerning the subsequent subject is for the acquaintance of more
reasonable creatures, as nearest to the nature of the Gods, according to
Poetical expressions delighted and refres head with this Nectar. and if in this
discourse I cannot mount the capacity of higher and more Gygantick reason, I
shall entreat their assistance, for the better information of my self and the
advantage of others, who cannot be better instructed at present by their humble
and faithful Servant.

THE BLOOD Of the GRAPE
ALthough my intention is principally to explicate the juce of the Grape, yet I
cannot but cast a Philosophycal glance upon Plants them selves as they are
integraly, or in their parts helpeful or hurtful, preserving the harmony of
humane nature by their homogeniality, or forcing a discord by their
heterogeniality, such therefore as in their integrality support nature in its
perpepual flux and reflux amongst Plants, are called in this tongue Pothearbs
as Lettice, Cabbidge, VVatercresses and such like, such as are the parts of
Plants are Roots as Parsnips, Radish, Carrootes and Turnips, there are also
some Plants which are specifically and by their universal temper appropriated
to particular parts of humane bodies, as Poeonia, Betonica, Salvia, Verbasculum,
for the head; Crocus and Melissa, for the heart; Menta for the ventricule;
Eupatorium for the Liver; Capperes, for the spleen; and Hirmodactilus for the
joints: There are other Plants also as pernicious to the whole body, or such
particular parts, as Hyosiamus for the head; Mezereon for the liver; Eruum for
the rheins and bladder; Aloes, for the Hamorhoids. There are also a third sort
of Plants which are doubtful, and they are more or less helpful to nature, as
Colocynthis, Scamonium, Senna and these are adjuvants by reason of their
Cathartique quality in seperating and educing corrupt humors from the
incorrupt: There are also Plants more lignous, firm and indissoluble, as Oak,
Appel and Peare-trees, and of this sort some less firm, as the Vine, which to
desect into its parts Containing and Contained, similar and dissimilar, were a
frustrate labor, because every botomique has published it more clear and
eleganly then can be expected from my self. I shall render my Conceptions only
of that similar part of the Vine, which we call liquid, and by Philosophers
understood Iuces, or Tears extracted from the Plant: This juce is the liquid
part diffused in the substances of the Plants themselves, which as their Blood
conserveth life in them, which brings me to my elect Subject, the Blood of
the Grape, and as it appears to be blood, in it is life, 't is from the Vine,
and that the Plant of life; and if the difference between this Plant and the
Tree of life in Paradise were but magis and minus 't is not so improbable as to
be rejected by any, for they will be both granted Plants of life, and they very
much respond in their Nature as well as Appellation: What the fruit was that
sprang from that in Paridice, is not as yet known, or not so perfectly
understood, as that of the Vine, the Nature of which is so lively as that Galen
will affirm it to augment radical heat, Galen: de Causs: Morb: Cap: 4.
which is the way to live for ever. Asclepiades the Phisician tells me, that
this Blood does consent more with the nature of the Gods then any other, and
that their Nature is incorrupt is without dispute: secondly he advises the use
of it to unsound and infirm Constitutions, to reduce them to a firm and
incorrupt temper, and according to the sense of Galen to aeternity in this
world; which cannot by any be understood of less then an extreme extention of
life, where it is properly or according to exact indication adhibited.
hownecessary then is the Study and perpension of this subject, as a difficulty
to explicate; necessary, because our lives are short, and difficult, because
Art is long and Experience dangerous; Yet if by this Act I shall be an
instrument to extend life, and abreviate Art, not only show the Plant, but
teach the use, it may prove worth my labor and acceptance of my inthrauled
Country, whose assurance shall be that my best reason and Philosophy shall be the
guide of my pen: neither Hippocrates, nor Galen, or any other authority farther
then I have digested them, and made them my own reason and to agree with
truth. As for the abreviation of Art, preservation of Life, and restoring the
infirm, we shall comprehend in a small Circle, and render in a few words, the
sum of al Classick writers to this purpose, as the fourteen books of Galen
his Method of curing and six of Health preserving in these few words expressed
(viz.) Diet and Medicine.

And by these two ways principally are life and Health extended and restored.
Quantity, quality and the Mode of application in them observed. Quantity as it
is usque ad vasa and ad vires secundum justitiam rather then the full capacity
of the recipient, because such quantity of aliment must be preduced into act by
the power of Nature, which quantity to the disiention of the vessels would
preve burden some, if not totally destructive. Quality as it corresponds with
humane bodies universally, or with this, or that individual, the well ordering of
both requires a just Consideration of the recipient subject, as it may be
exactly tempered, or valetudinarie; This term Quantity of reth me a discourse
with Lessius which seems to prefer a quantity ad pondus of Diet, as most
conducing to the preservation of health, and extention of Life, as if satiation
were the usher of diseases and mortality, as a corruptive Cause, which I cannot
conceive reasonable, nor can he render any Argument a testimonio but from his
own observation; which argument a parti^ulari my Logique can not approve, nor
will it concur with the Reason of others more reasonable, to adhibite a strict
weight of aliment upon no occasion or difference of temper or distemper to be
exceded or lessened, nor can it be granted by any (except Religious) who
wilfully and unreasonably Chastise their Bodies to merit some thing beyond al
intellect or reasonable expression, for in a phisical sense noe artist can
embrace it otherwise then Heretical, if he will ground his opinion upon the rule
of Hippocrates and Gallen, scil: Contraria contrarijs curantur, that Diseases
are recovered by their contraries as inanition by fasting must be recovered by
repletion in feeding; and this inanition may be extreme or not. and in such
condition no sever pondus or weight can be observed for although inanition must
be replenished, yet it must be effected by repetition often of Concoctible
aliment, in more or less quantity according to the convenient power of the
parts recipient, as for the quality of the aliment according to the rule of ijs
nutrimur quibus constamus must be Homogeneal for the support of universal
nature as well as the recovery of each morbid individual and in this point the
auntients have been observed exceeding strict and as they had great reason so
is the judgment of any Physician most seen and censured by his election of
aliment in quality agreeable to the temper of body, for although an effect must
be cured by its contrary, yet the right temper must be supported by its own
simile, as heat by heat and moisture by moisture, but whither in degree more
or less moist or intense, is indicated by the natural constitution of that
body and to be ordered by the Physician, but this is a Paradox ot not
understood by vulgar practicers who argue falsely upon this true ground of
Hyppocrates, so such as accept his Contraria contrarijs curantur to be a rule
without exception in nourishing as much as curing, as if there were noe
difference between contrary, and contrary, Rebellion and Loyalty, 't is truth
as remedies they must be contrary to the affect and thus Arist: will have a
crooked Plant bent as much the other way to straiten it, but if a strait Plant
shall be incurvated there will be consequently an organical affect, which we call
vitiata figura, so also if contrary remedies or qualeties shall be applied to an
harmonius temper, it will be a cause efficient of discord and conflict in nature
or in the fore said temper, therefore it is apparent, that the quality is more
to be observed either in meat or Medicine then the quantity (especially of
aliment) because natural choice of food is in noe Creature of health ultra
capacitatem recipientis, but if any Lessian shall dispute as strictly for
temperance according to his measure, I must severally as a Physician tell them
the Worthies of our Art prefers excess before such temperance, for they
affirm Canonically that al affects or diseases of plentitude or fullness are
more safe because more curable then diseases of Emptiness, and who does not
apprehend variety of reason in this axiom, first because universal evacuation
is sooner effected then repletion; Secondly, because accidents of various
forms cannot be avoided for they are infinite, and the least affliction upon
an extenuate and lessiate body, for defect of excrementitious humors to
involue them, gives a dangerous charge to the radical principles, because both
the disease and medicine having nothing else to encounter must tyrannise over
enfeebled nature as by its own impotency not able to resist which Conatus
naturae or endeavor to expel noctious causes does over heat the spirits and
effect such preternatural heat by its motion from the Center to the
Circumference as does inflame natural heat according to Christophorus a vega
and not otherwise by the ascent of putrid fuliginous vapors to the Heart
according to vulgar opinion; Contrarily, where there is a sufficiency of
excrementitious humors to entertain both the Disease and Remedy, there are
they retained with less oppression and danger to the radical spirits, and
removed with less offense to the universal temper of the person so laboring
as will be more Phylosophically demonstrated according to this subsequent mode.
Albertus, and many other Philosophers do constitute in mixed Bodies a two fold
Moisture: one which they nominate humidum continuans and from this continuating
humidity the Iunction of parts does proceed, otherwise they would be al
siccity, and consequently upon any motion disunited; therefore there is no
natural Body void of this Humidity, though never so hard or grave, as is daily
demonstrated by every Chemical Operator, every hour extracting oil out of the
hardest body; Therefore this Humidity is by Physicians nominated Oleaginosum
humidum an oyley moisture, consisting of ayrie and aqueous moisture.

The other humidity being humidum quasi nutriens is a waterish moisture in the
mixed body, nothing advantageous to the continuation of parts, and because of
its tenuity is easily resolved which cannot with such facility be effected upon
the Oleaginous, because of its crassitude or thickness, so that were a
proportion of excrementitious humors is wanting in a body by reason of a
severe or thin Diet, in that body both disease, and medicine must of necessity
be more tyrannical over the fixed moisture, which is the ligament of life; and
for this cause all Physicians will acknowledge Diseases of fullness admit of a
more safe and speedy cure then those of inanition, as diseases also of a cold
quality admit of a more safe remedy then hot distempers, because in the
application of hot remedies to the former we foment natural heat, and our cold
applications to the other, we do not only debilitate, but very often
extinguish natural heat. But because I intend noe Controversy, I shall fix my
self upon my proper subject, and show how every temper may be preserved void
of all distempers, proceeding from the material principles of nature by the use
of Wine, and also prove it to be an excellent and specifical remedy, in all
affects produced by the discord of the foresaid Principles, being peritely
applied according to proper indication, nor shall I be prolix in my tractation
of all the parts of this discourse. Curiosity and expectation will prove
abhortive, if a taste of this promised Juice be not suddenly presented, whose
nature and excellency has and does appear in our former expressions, to be
Encomiastick sufficient, and such excellent Nectar in the opinion of Noah, that
he made it is first Act of Husbandry after the Deluge to Plant a vinyard,
before any other fruit or grain, as is affirmed by sacred Testimony: The
reason of that act, if I should presume to render or explicate that Text,
without better quallification, I might not without cause, from Theologists,
have thrown upon me that snuff of Ne suitor ultra crepidam; yet can I not so
much inthrall my fancy, or suffocate such notions as may be probable though not
an absolute and perfect Demonstration, as to pass by his first act after his
Resurrection, or not to take notice of his age, which I find extended twenty
years beyond the age of Adam, in whom the Principles of nature according to my
reason and sense should have been most pure and durable: Nor can I argue
otherwise, but that matter so formed must be subject to daily decay by
perpetual motion, there fore how Noah after so many Centuries from Adam
should in age extend twenty years longer can make noe impression in my reason:
(the taste of this Nectar excepted) which is (I conceive) an inferior speties
of that Plant of Life from which Adam was excluded, for had it been of equal
or the same perfection, whereas he lived after his Plantation Three Hundred and
fifty years (which was a good Cordial) yet he had now been living and
eternal in this world, but as a best second was proved by his own experience,
and by six hundred years observation, he could not but be sufficiently taught
how to frame reasonable arguments to satisfy both himself and others; and by
reducing it into its principles, make a sensible discovery of natures mystery
and upon such like experimental observation did he plant his Vinyard: so that
by inference the excellency of this subjectt does appear more transcendent
then any other Juice either of vegitall or Animal: Therefore it shall be my next
consideration, to explicate the nature of it, with its difference and use, both
in respect of aliment and Medicament and with its application to every
individual, of every age, and temper; therefore that we may act as much as we
speak, let us look upon the quality of Wine Philosophically; and at the first
view we shall discover a two fold heat in it, as it issues from a living body
(Viz.) an animal and elementary heat, for though Wine cannot be said to be
animatum, such as gives a soul or life; yet it may carry with it, and to its
self the Impression of a centrall or implanted heat from a soul as may
plainly be demonstrated in other things; as the seed of Animals or of plants,
have not a soul in act according to the Doctrine of Aristotel; Yet it does
take from a soul such a generative power like unto the soul, which (
Aristotel says) is nothing else, but a vital heat distinct from igneous and
elementary; so as in the generation of a living Creature the first moving is
Animal, or the Plant from which the seed issues, but the seed is the
instrument which by a power of vitallity received from the Plant begets
another being like it self; since therefore there is in semine, a vital heat
distinct from elementary, why may we not affirm the same of Wine, which in
like manner issues from an animate body; then will Wine appear to have a
double heat, or one conflate or moved out of two, and that which is great and
intense does not consist of an indivisible, because it is greater or less
according to the variety of species, and diversity of situation or places; for
in those Regions where the sun effects a stronger heat, there grow hotter
Wines, and this heat is not external, but rather natural and implanted in the
Wine because from the heat of the place, the vital and elementary heat, which
constituteth the natural heat of the Wine, does become more great and intense;
nor can it be denied, in Wine to be a double moisture according to Gallen; who
distinguishes the substance Vinosa, from the substance Aquosa, the qualitas
vinosa, being that humidity inherent which does unite the parts, and the
waterish substance, is only that which is contracted from aliment: for so long
as the Grape was conjoined to the Vine, there did flow there unto a waterish
humor by which it was nourished, and after it is separated from the Vine, does
still retain that waterish humor, which as then was not converted, nor
assimulated into the substance of Wine; nor can it have any further conversion,
because the wine is now noe more animatum, or able to produce it into Act; and
this is that humidity in Wine which is spent or wasted in boiling, the other
remains which is innate and fixed to the substance of Wine, and hence it is
that the boiling of Wine does render it more sweet; for by the expense of this
humidity the juice returns to its own natural moisture; And this (I hope)
will be satisfaction concerning the General nature of Wine: which familiarity
with humayne nature will appear; the nature of all Wines being either
corroberative and nutritive or mundificative, or apperative, and these are not
only testified by the ancient and learned Physicians; but proved out of their
own existence and prime animation; which will be hereafter demonstrated, in our
progress; therefore we cannot but take notice of the distinction of Wines by
their names and colors. Concerning their difference in names, they are
sovarious, as to render them in all their appellations, will relish more of
curiosity, then utility: many of them being fantastically imposed by the wanton
singularity in Merchants of al Nations; but so many as Philosophers,
Physicians and Poets have notefied, I shall briefly declare and then pass to
their Colors. In the first place let us take notice of the General name vinum
and so denominated a vi, and vincendo, from the power and strength of it,
according to Varro; and I render it vinum quasi divinum, and so the pleasant
Nectar of the Gods; the ancients had many sorts different in name, as Fortinum,
newly expressed from the Grape, Protopum, such as fell from the Vine before the
Grapes were trodden; Others which take their names from the Region in which
they grow; As Chium, Lesbium, Falernum, Cacubum, Surrentinum, Caelenum,
Signinum, Tarraconense, Spoletinum, Ceretanum, Fundanum, Malvaticum; Amongst
the French many others, as Vinum Remense, burdegalense, Aurelianense Belonense,
Divionense, Montispedonense; And these agree better, (as Table Drinks) with
sound bodies, then infirm constitutions, there are more debile and dilute wines
in France which agree better with febrile dispositions, then with cold
Phlegmatic tempers; As Parisiense, Limonicense, Forense, Alobrogense, with
many others, and since both their names are known, and their natures in part,
and such tempers to which they are most concenient, let us take a taste, and
principally pierce these four vessels, (Viz.) Sweet, accute, Austere, and
Mild, observing their colors (Viz.) White, Sanguineus, Yellow and Black; the
first three commonly known to us by their names of White, Claret and Sack; and
these admit of their differences; for as there are several sorts of Sack and
claret, so are there also of White Wines, some Sweet, some Austere, some
thick, others limped and clear, and all these pure nutritives; but inferior in
degree of nourishing to such as are sweet; And although Dulcia Maxim nutriunt
must be with this caution, that the Liver, Spleen and Reins be void of
obstruction, which because they generally obteyn a body more crasse, they are
said to obstruct; Thushaving briefly and Philosophically desected their bodies
and preferred their nature and specifical difference to public view, I shall
present them to a medicall consideration.

The quallityes generally received by all Physicians, are neutritive and they
do nourish super omnia alimenta, if Gallen: may have credit: because Wine is
semi sanguis, or half blood, before it be received and produced into act with
a less fire of nature, and leaves behind it no excrement, as all other
vegitalls and animalls do; it does also evacuate both sursum and deorsum
upward and downward; it does corrobarate all faculties, attractive, retentive,
concoctive and distributive; it does correct putrefaction; open obstructions;
and exhilerat the spirits; what more is now requisite or needful for
preservation or restoration of health and life, then this so familiar to the
principles of humayne bodies, and so undoubtedly known, in most Regions, and
incomparable with any other vegitall, or mineral (especially) mineralls, whose
nature is destructive and Heterogeneall to all animalls? who according to
Philosophical observation non patitur afflictionem which cannot be avoided in
them, because their preparation consists of a just regiment of fire; which
was so hard to be gained by Iohannis Crato, that for that uncertainty instead
of his Chimicall Tutor he chose a Gallenest; And my self have observed very
exact Chimists, whose medicines of the same kind, and prepared with as much
diligence as possible; sometimes so gentle, as children would not complain;
and again so violent, as the strongest nature could not sustain; which much
confirmed my opinion with Crato of the difficulties to effect that just
Regiment of fire; and if we be curious in our scrutation we shall find also
much, if not irreconcilable difference in other drugs Galenicall, both in
figure and operation: especially such as are transported from other Regions,
which I dare affirm are not known to us according to their natural perfection,
and though the use of them be doubtful, yet frequent, and if we do know them,
either we cannot have them, or such is their change and alteration in
transportation as does force us to blame the ancients for their high applause
of them, we not finding in the applicaton of them according to proper scope,
and indication any such excellency; and if any will credit Christophorus Barri
(the Jesuit) in his Relation of Cohinchina to his Holy Father the Pope, to
whom he does protest that the Rhubarbe he brought from thence with many other
Drugs, were so altered in their transportation, as without a special script
upon them, he could not have known them to be the same either in virtue, or
color; and that learned and expert modern ( Symphorianus) does challeng most
of our Pharmacall Compositions upon the same ground and does affirm the chief
ingredients to be unknown or found in the shops of Europian Apothecaries, for
better satisfaction accept his own words, sed quod res quasdam vel non
afferis, vel non sine macula, vel in totum ignorari puto: ea sunt Balsamum,
Cardamomum, Myrrha, Nardus Indica, Caffia, scordium, Cinnamomum, Radix
Pentaphilli, Calamus Ordoratus, Xylobalsomum. This Challenge I suppo2e will be
difficult to answer by the perpenders: what shall we then say to the great
incertainty of the most grand Compositions in our Pharmacopea? but that with
them we do pugnare contra hostem clausis oculis. I could raise many Disputes
upon other things much in use amongst us, and their incertainety of their
virtues; besides the nonsatisfaction of their entity according to vulgar
opinion, and such different descriptions, as have been divulged; as
Vnicornes-horne, Bezoardstone, and such like: but my intention is rather to be
taught, then controvert, or else to inform others; for which cause I have
undertaken the tractation of this subject: the Plant and Juice there of being
so well known to al Nations, and sensible without controversy to all
reasonable Creatures, and used in all places with respect to their special
difference, from the womb, which nourishes and produces them; and if I shall
not more clearly manifest the foresaid Qualities to be in it, and by the
Consultations of more learned, then my self, then shall I in no manner give so
full satisfaction to the expectator; Therefore that which was last in my
intention, shall be first in execution; and though I render not an Index of
Authors, yet my subsequent Arguments shall be from testimony; not doubting to
clear our opinion to the full extension of such argumentation, and after this
Dialecticall form to clear the Point.

The first then is, that Wine nourishes above all other aliment; They who have
had acquaintance with Galen: know they are his words translated; and that some
nourish more or less, according to their special quality, as Vina aquea per
exiguum alimentum corpori praebent, quae vero crassa sunt et color rubra, plus
alimenti habent quam reliqua vina. Galen. Secondly, that it does corroborate:
Vinum confortat spiritum, and in spiritum convertitur, and fortificat virtutem;
Avicen: Thirdly that it does evacuate; Vina crassa dulciaque quod alvum
deijciant nemini fera ignotum est; sicut multum quod tametsi aegre concoquatur
crassumque succum and inflationes faciat, alvum tamen movet: Galen. Fourthly,
that it does open obstruction: Vinum dulce vehementer apperit oppilationes
pulmonis. Avicen: Lastly, that it does exhilerate the spirits, is proved by
sacred testimony, Scil: Vinum cor hominis exhilerat. Thus have I Briefly
rendered a confirmation of the a foresaid qualities medically in Wine; and
Justified them by ancient and orthodox authority; Notwithstanding for further
satisafaction, let us cast our eye upon the quality of Wines as they are
obviously di2coursed in gross by most or all the prime Auntients, Scil: White
Wine may be adhibited in all acute and hot distempers ut voluit Hippocrates;
sweet Wine in cold diseases; because it heateth the body more, sed calefactione
temperata Galen: no white Wine is sweet, and such as is pure and subtle moves
urine strenuously, without any impression in the head, because it does not
manifestly heat, but sensibly refrigerate and is ordained in febre continua,
Galen; Wine in General moderately used does purge choler by urine, exhilarate
the mind, and refres heth the senses; Wine also that is dilute may safely and
profitably be adhibited in an Apozemicall form in fevers; as will appear in
our subsequent tractation of particular, and most grand distempers; White Wine
does sensibly refrigerate and cleanse the Lungs, and one Drought does
Extinguish thirst more then one gallon of barley water; as my own experience
for many years, and in many hundred persons can affirm; sweet wines also may
be adhibited in acute passions as pleurisies and inflammation of the lungs, to
provoke expectoration, when the matter is di2gested according to Oribatius,
Haliabbas, Constantius Monachus, Wine also that is white, subtle, and thin,
is not turbulent to the ventricle, but of easy digestion, soon penetrates the
veins, provokes urine, and leaves no excrement, as does all other vegitals
or Animals and minorals; And as before said that it does in all hot distempers
Extinguish thirst, is the observation also of Isaac the Son of Solomon an
Arabian King; Lastly white Wine is said to be insipide dilut, coagulate by its
frigiditie in se; Yet under favor in respect of its universal parts, there can
be no such Coagulation, as is affirmed by Johannes Portugalensis once Pope of
Rome; These are the universal opinions of the Ancients; yet the reason of the
reader may exact a more demonstrative proof of such contraritie in the same
body of so pure a nature, as to open and close, to corroborate and debilitate,
and that these contrary acts should appear at the same time, in the same
subject to whom it is Applied, as that Wine, as you have heard, should
generally Evacuate Excreme^titious humors of the body or particularly purge
bilious Matter by Urine and yet the same specifical Wine shall corroborate the
whole and every part it works upon at the same time; for although every
perfect body be mixed of the principles of rarety, density and graetie, yet if
their shall be the addition of one other digestion they will separate in
themselves, and levitie will not appear as levitie and gravetie in the same
sphere; as wine does after the addition of several digestions, more then is
received from the plant in its mixture; and though there are occult qualities
of which no other proof can be made, then such an illogicall argument as is
Framed a particulari; or that it does work so; yet when I contemplate the
supernatural perfection of mixture in this plant, Exceedinge and comprehending
all other Vegitals and Minerals as does appear by its puretie in nature, which
as gold will nor does receive any, but a seeming corruption; but Exceeding gold
in its familiarity which humane complexion, and the Complement or Epitome of
all other plants; as Man is in his form, and mixture the short representative
of the great world; And as we are sensible, and knowing these qualeties to be
in Wine so will they appear with as little contradictio^ as those of inferior
Plants, Scil: Guiacum, which does by constringing evacuate, as is more manifest
in the squeeszing of a spung: or Rhubarb, which does constring by purgeing,
others will have a catholic and incorruptible spirit in wine exceeding all
such mixtures; and that it moves as a free Agent in its sphere of activitie;
and for sthis reason has Philosophers and Poets suppo2ed it to participate with
the nature of the Gods, which must move as liberal agents; It may also in more
plane phylosophie appear to move after such manner by virtue of its fluent and
fixed heat, the one oleaginous continuating, binding and uniting the parts
together, the other fluent attenuating the humors, and loosening the belly or
body universally, and thus probably to effect such contrary actions out of its
natural mixture, since therefore it can and does operate in such manner, there
is much reason it should be thus used, no other vegital or mineral so pleasant
or perfectly concocted, (except gold) nor any so familiar to humane Nature all
other fruits, and juces being more subject to putrefaction or such like
alteration, and more onerous to nature in concoction, and by reason of their
less perfect concoction, most of them breeding little blood, or vicious blood
or none at all; but wine, especially red wine, is half blood before it be
received; and when I find the Ancients, nominate it, the old man's milk, they
must grant it a super -- concoction to blood, as it is cited in jecore; for
milk is blood dealbated, and such as have received a more perfect concoction,
then it has in the liver; And for its encomiasticke, it is the Medicine that
seteth a true edge upon nature, supporteth an appetite in being, and recovereth
it languishing; And where as medicamentum is defined, to be a medium between
poison and aliment, and by consequence must leave after operation some venomous
contact; this Medicine is so different in operation, as that it leaves a
lively contact, and because of its universal homogenialitie with nature,
cannot be comprehended under the diffinition of medicamentum, though so
nominated, because a true diffinition does explicate the nature and Essence of
the thing defined, yet that it is a medicine, and under such notion apprehended
the practice of Avicenna, Rhasis, and Averroes justify, when themselv's used
twice every month to move their body's with the same either sursum vel deorsum,
or both; And if my own observation may be acceptable then I cannot conceal
such powerful Effects as my self has felt, and seen in others; Scil:
consumptive and extenuate bodies restored to a sarcocity, and from withered
Bodies to fresh, plumpe, fat and fleshie; and from old and infirm to young, and
strong; when as water or small bear Drinkers were countenanced more like Apes
then Men; and if I had no other reason but my own experience it were Enough to
engage my faith, concerning its excellency. My eye now is converted upon the
vulgar, and find their pulse in a disordred Motion, their hearts being
preternaturally dilated with the report of preservation from death, sickness,
and pain, because Natural death and extreem old age suffers dissolution with
out any pain, and all these to be effected with a medicine so familiar, as no
longer they can forbear the proverb, that he that is not now a physician must
be dubed for a fool; But let such apprehensions be careful of the right
application of this Medicament, least the title be inverted upon themselves,
for the difference of tempers, distempers, times and clymes, with circumstance
of sex, will exercise the best Hippocratist or Philosopher rightly to order and
aply this remedy; for causes external of Melancholy are more frequent in
Aethiopia, then any other region, the air being cold and dry, and the time
principaly in which this humer does Move is the Autumn. Though Hippocrates will
have the spring to have precedence, yet I understand the affect the be
generated in either, but propagated through the whole body in the winter; so
that these circumstances neglected and the remedy contrary to proper
indication or ignorantly advised, the principles of nature must suffer
abbreviation in stead of Extension; Empericks stand here like the fiction of
Tantalus, the fruit is not only in conspectu, but with in the space of their
grasp, yet deprived of contact, they may see this subject transcending their
logic from a particular to a universal; Nor can they argue from experience who
know not what they do, in every one of these following respects, which are
beyond the capacity of an Emperick, quatenus Emperick; Yet before I proceed in
the fore said respects, give me leave to salute Plato, who has tackt me with
aprohibition concerning Kings, Magistrates, soldiers, women and servants, to
whom he absolutely prohibiteth the use of wine in any Region, or at any time,
as if he would appropriate this felicity only to the Commonweal of
scholars; but upon farther perpension we cannot but return a candid
interpretation; for doubtless he intended principally sobriety, not
forbidding the moderate use of wine to any such person before named, otherwise
he must deprive them of the refreshment of spirit, and the generation of
incorrupt humors; which has principal relation to all the faculties, both
natural, vital, and animal; and if notice be taken of the Excessive operation
of this juce, kings will be verrie sensible of its adjuvancie in their election
of officers and servants of all conditions, because it opens the closest
locks, and discovers the most good or evil intentions; all excess working upon
the subject according to its disposition or predominance of humor; And no Tyron
will deny the behavior of men to agree with their various Complexions, nor
that the same specisick, wine does irradiate it self with as much variety, as
are their individual persons; as a candle set up in a lanthern composed of
various Colored glass scil: white, red green, blew, black, yellow, or any
other mixed Coulor, the Irradiation through every one of these of the foresaid
lamp, will correspond or answer the complexion of each particular glass; And
the Dutch make it a rule of politics, by which they steer their course of al
contracts by it, and will not conclude any bargain before they see the spirit
of wine operate, for fear of some concealed snake under the herbs; And
doubtless the moderat use of wine, for the animation of the soldiers, the
inlivening of the Magistrate, and recoverie of women, is profitable, Especially
in hystericall sits; according to Hippocrates. Hipp: I denatura Mulierum
And my transision now shall be to the tempers of humane bodies in general,
and the wynes generally agreeing with those tempers; and then more particularly
to this or that individual. Temper it self being the reason of mixture, or
the harmony and consent of the prime qualities in Elements, and by the
Exuberancie of each simple quality, these four simple tempers are created; as
hot, when the heat predominateth over the cold, and yet of siccity and moisture
remains an equallity; and so of the rest, as cold, dry and moist, besides
these four conjugate tempers, which proceed from the exuberancy of the two
first qualities, as hot and moist, hot and dry, cold and moist, cold and dry,
which are the four compound tempers, their fixation consisting in that
oleaginous humor, which we call innatum calidum; and this innate so utile,
and necessary, as a cause with out which mixed bodies cannot subsist; 't is also
fomented and supported by fluent heat contracted in the heart, veins and
Arteries, as their proper Channels consisting of spiritual blood preserved in
the heart, as the middle of the body, which by a lively consent does maintain
and support innate heat, and perfect the universal temper of the body, even as
the Sun inliveneth, and inlightne h the great world, so does the heart
ejaculate a fluent heat to the vivisication of the microcosine, or little world
of humane bodies, refreshing every part, and exciting every particular function
to its proper motion; so as the innate or fixed spirit does very much respond
the fluent, and such resiprocall concordance is as necessary as circulation in
the sun, whose motion being stopped, or influence extinguished but one hour,
would be the ruin of the whole world; and if such a cause may be admitted, as
some call causa sine qua non, then this comerce between fluent and fixed heat
may be so accepted, for otherwise all natural actions are quiet and extinct:
therefore these being the prime existence and subsistence of humane nature,
and such powerful agents in conformation and nutrition, their sphere of
motion may be more or less adapted by external means, either homogeniall or
heterogeneall; And for tempers or distempers in general there can be no
aliment or medicament so convenient and agreeable as wine; for the smallest
wine (if pure) is a more neat and clear pabulum, to the fluent spirits, then
recent eggs, or milk sucked from any creature; they all onerating nature with
some excrement after concoction, and in concoction must be some expense both of
fluent and fixed heart, which is so much an abbreviation to a natural being,
but is of such puretie and spirituality, as does receive a sudden mutation, and
in its alteration adds both light and heat to the foresaid principles, as the
oil of those natural lamps. Fernelius apprehends much danger either in meat
or medicine, which are onerous to the principles of nature; and therefore will
have all cold diseases admit of a more safe remedy, then hot distempers,
because in the regular way of cureing by contraries, the application of hot
remedies to cold affects does foment and maintain natural heat, contrarily in
the application of cold remedies in hot distempers, to extinguish preternatural
heart; the natural heat does suffer much and many times is extinct with
praeternaturall or febrill heat; but in both cold and hot affects the
application of wine upon proper indication, is the most Excellent and in
ofensive remedy. And that it is such a remedy, I shall pro duce some probable
Arguments to make it more apparent to vulger intellects, after this subsequent
mode. If it were by the most learned Auntients in Medicine adhibited, as a safe
remedy in fevers, then it acounted proper in hot distempers, for thus it has
been administered by them, as has been demonstrated in our former discourse,
and will be more apparent in our following of the particular and most grand
affects of humane bodies; And if it has also been derected and ordained by the
same authority in cold distempers, then it is a proper remedy and approved in
both; And if we perpend the specifical differences of wines, then we shall make
it a regular remedy according to the rule of Contrariety; for Wine that is
generous moves in all tempers from the Centure to the circumference; and other
Wynes in their proper nature more apperient, open obstructions, and in a
Galenicall sense all oppilations are efficient causes of putrefaction and
putrefaction of fevers; so that opening being a contrary motion to obstruction,
Wine is a contrary remedy per se in oppilation Et per accidens in putrid
fevers; Now I shall descend to particular and difficult effects controverted
amongst the Most learned, and where I find them differ in this point, shall
endeavor to reconcile them, for the satisfaction of greener students, and
practicers less perite which after industry will effect; not but his
undertaking, would better become a more learned pen and Person of a more
settled condition, then a person so many years Exiled with his dear
sovereign, and patient Master; yet I shall proceed in the first place to that
affect, which we nominate a Frency which in truth is more properly the
termination of al discourse it self being the privation of discourse, conjunct
with a fever, and in this case, whither wine may be commonly adhibited, is the
difference amongst the ancient, Hippoc. lib. de affect, intern.
some commending, others doubting; Hippocrates affirms, the use of wine
convenient, in all perturbations of the mind, Tralianus in the same condition,
where the spirits are Spent, the ventricle cold, and debil, and upon the
appearance of some concoction, in vigilancie, or defect of rest, because of its
narcotique quality, which is most sure, and agreeable to humane nature, and for
this special reason, Epicurus has taken it in large proportion, not only in
all painful affects, but also in the article of death, in a palsy also, which
affect obtayneth amongst the Grecians many appellations, Galen. 2. Gal. 1.
Scil: Paralisia, and Gal: paraplexia, by the major part of Physicians, to be
apprehended of the same signification, and that all the terms signify
privation of sense, and motion, in a sensible moving part; Whither wine be
useful in this affect, is much controverted; Halyabbas, and Avicen, in this
case appear Hydroposians, or water drinkers, and render this reason for the
non adhibition of wine, in this affect, because say they, Wine is a proper
vehicle, of humors to the nerves, and by its sharpnes, or pungent quality,
does enervate, and by consequent foment the disease; To which I answer, that no
kind of wine moderately taken, and with out any mixture, can, or does enervate
quatenus vinum, because it nourishes above any thing, and therefore is the
most proper corrective of such sharp humors, because it breeds, so sweet
aliment ergo no vehicle of enervation, as they would have it; nor for their
water drinking, without the assistance of more exact Philosophy, can I
apprehend a greater enemy to the nerves, then cold, nor any congregation, both
of heterogenealls, homogenealls, or ligation of sense, equally powerful to the
quality of cold, but if they intend medicate water, it will obtain less
censure, though not received a comparative with wine, which used with
moderation, by its dulced nature, does exceed all corroboratives, either
chymically, or galenically prepared, and ordained, especially, when the affect
is chronicall, for some times the affect proves acute in the beginning, and
then indicateth a thinner nutriment, but pure water according to Arist, does
not nourish, as has bin formerly disputed, in my tract of waters; In Spasmo,
or a convulsive motion when the moving faculty is depraved, will be a quaestion
controverted, of the same nature, concerning the use of this juice; Celsus in
this affect, does prohibit the use of Wine, with better reason then either
Avicen, or Halyabbas, because wine does dilate, and thus contract the nerves,
which sensibly appears to all artificers, Hippoc. 5. Apher. 2. de morb.
educated by sensible precepts, to induce convulsions, according to Hippoc, and
not without the consent of Avicen and Serapio in this case the adhibition of
dilute wine, in reconciliation of these authors, Celsus must by my self be
understood to speak of this affect, quatenus in principio; and if my memory in
so long exile both from my Country, and books (by that ever cursed Parliament of
1641. fail me not) these are his own words, In principio nequaquam convenit
vinum, ubi autem morbus declinare incipit, Hippoc. 4. de acutis.
vinum convenit, quia magis dissipat, and attenuat, and after the same manner
Hippoc. must be understood, where he ordains wine, for although wine may not
be so convenient in the beginning of a convulsion, yet in the progress of the
disease, must be a proper adjuvant; In opthalmia, or inflammation of the eyes
Mercurialis ordains wine in the declention, for the unquestionable drink,
without any mixture, because it does then concoct, and determine the disease,
Galen. 6. Aphor. 31.
especially generated of cold matter, and cause blood, in which case Galen
affirms vinum generosum, and that he has effected this cure, by the same
means in a pleurisy, Hippoc. 3. de Morbis.
which is a phlegmon, of the membrane succinct the Ribbs. Hippoc. ordains the
use of sweet wine, as an in crassative, and expectorative which are most
properly indicated from the inflammation it self yet the stricter sort of
Physicians are of opinion, this book, reputationis causa, was by the Cnydians
composed, and published, under his name, Hippoc. l. de acut.
the doubt is raised, out of his own book de acutis, where he damneth the
Cyndian Physicians for their ignorance, and want of regular government in the
diaeting affected persons, yet none can accept against the use of hot
qualities, as adverse to the breast; In a cyncope, or passion of the heart,
which although most diseases in their course, offer offense to this part, yet I
could never meet with any, that by a special excellency, or propriety were
affects of this noble part, but these two Scil: affectus syncopalis, and
palpitatio cordis, and these have their prime localitie in the heart, in the
first of these passions, and in all such persons affected, the considiration
is, how convenient, the use of wine will appear, Gal. l. 1. ad Glane 14 Method.
22 Avicen 11. Cap. 3. de Sinc.
being for aliment, or medicament much doubted, by some Physicians, because
Galen, and Avicen do except against the use of wine as obnoxious to such
persons, as are afflicted from the head or labor with ingent feavors; To which
I answer though this passion of the heart, may be more oppressed with such
consent of parts, and complication of affects, yet extra paroxismum, or upon
the least appearance of victory in nature, where refection of spent spirits is
indicated, there is nothing so safe, and suddayne to effect it as wine, Averr.
7 Collect. 7
in this respect it is by a compulsive necessity, to be abhibited, and
Averroes is of my sense in this case, as also the Saraceus amongst whom it was
a custom or law, not to taste of wine ordinarily, yet in such necessity they
were permitted wine, and in this passion, as the best remedy, so is it also in
palpitatione Cordis; or in the unnatural beating of the heart least by the
deficiencie of spirit, or any other preternatural Conatus, the aegrotant fall
into the former passion, which is a syncope; provided in this palpitation the
wine be old, and pure; Amongst the various diseases of the ventricle, I shall
only rest upon the Canine appetite, or the unnatural lust after meat, because
it admits more doubt, then any of the precedent affects, wine being
generally granted by consent both Theological, and humane, to be most proper
to excite a depraved appetite, Hyppoc: 2. aph. 21
according to its proper acception, for some wine according to Hyppocrates,
does extinguish hunger, and Galen: does in his interpretation conceive him
principally to intend this canine appetite, and the specifique wine to be most
pure, and without mixture; and in my own opinion, where this affect shall
proceed from a cold, and depraved humor, vitiating the retentive faculty, the
use of wine pure is an excellent remedy; Hippoc: de art veter.
and yet I meet an exception in Hyppoc: though wine be pure, yet if old (that
is superannuated) and lusty, such as we call Vinum vetus generosum, by him is
not in this case permitted, Galen: 7. meth.
by which it is manifest that he took notice of the specificall difference in
wines, Galen: also is of the same sense, but they must by my comment be
understood of excess, which will deject the appetite, and so prove a bonum
presens, but if this excess prove vomitorius, and so cleanse the ventricle of
the morbid cause, then 't is a plain curative; Concerning immoderate thirst,
which is conjunct with all feavors, and of it self an immoderate, or excessive
appetite of moisture, whither wine of any degree, may increase, or extinguish
this symptom, is the doubt; because siccitie by the rule of contrariety, can
not be corrected but with humiditie, therefore wine being generally by the most
Physicians in France adjudged hot and dry, can not be granted a remedy in this
case; the reasons of their opinion, I can conceive to be no other then they
render for Phlebotomie, in all affects, and at all times, ages, and sexes, and
the mode of France is their sole argument, and they would have others accept it
a Demonstrative, I am sure in neither opinion, either Grecians, Arabians, or
learned Modernes will join Issue with them; Galen: will have the sweetest wine
to be the most moist of all other liquids, and though it does heat; 't is
calefactione temperata, which is no praeternaturall, or intemperate caliditie,
and both Galen: Hyppoc: salut diae^ 30.
and Hippoc: testify small dilute wine does quench, or extinguish thirst, much
more in a small quantity, then fountainewater in a large measur, of one time,
or by often repetition, for these reasons, because dilute wine is cold and
moist, ergo most proper to correct hot and dry, and extinguish thirst; there is
also a more penetrative power in wine, then in water, and as humective, there
fore does sooner determine thirst; and my self have many years observed in the
highest feavors, one draught of dilute wine, to effect more then many flagons
of water, or such like, cold decoctions, nor can any Physician satisfy such
thirst with water, and not tumble upon this rock scil: extinction, or
debilitation of natural heat, with praeternaturalie in illeo, or the twisting
of the bowels, which affect sometime is a consequent of the collique, and by
which they are often strangled, and a disease, not frequently noted in Medicall
books; Celius Aurel: says that the Pythagoreans in Sicile, Call: anrel. l. 3.
de acut. passion^s,
were accustomed to nominate this disease Sepimentum, as if there were a hedge,
separating the bowels, others call in Volentus, or rolling of the bowels over
each other Scribonius, and Marcellus does name it a Phlegmon, or inflammation
both of small and great guts, others call it tormentum acutum and illiacam
passionem, and these appellations will be acknowledged; for no sharp pain (in
my opinion) can be inflicted upon a sensible body; whither Wine in this grand
inflammation, may be conducible, will prove a quarrel between Hippoc: Hop: 3.
de morb:
and Caelius, the one ordayning the drinking of generose wine in this case; the
other absolutely damning it in the whole course of cure; by which does appear a
grand misunderstanding, in my last Author, concerning Hippoc: and a rash
censure, because Hippoc: in that place forementioned, does conceive this affect
to proceed principally from a cold cause, and such humors are more reasonably
dissolved by generous wine, then any other; and mine own reason of this remedy
is grounded upon the non passage of excrements in this disease, and the
necessity of nutriment, by which it will appear, that from this remedy, can
proceed no oneration of the body with excrements, because it leaves none, or
any that passes thorough any Port, or passage, but the bladder; and for
aliment, no other succus, so speedy and inoffensive. The antecedent affect
being the disturbance of the receptacles of dry excrements, it will not look
like a disorderly motion to commit to every consideration such affects, as do
molest the receptacles of moist excrements, and principally the obstruction of
the Rhenes, which parts were dedicated by nature to no other use elce, but to
separat serososhumores from the blood, and conveigh them through the body, by
those ducts, and channells according to the universal opinion of all
Physicians, since therefore this is their office, and that this percolation is
hindered often by oppilation from several causes, producing various affects,
the most common cause being the Stone, and that in the cavity of the Rhenes,
though other affects are subjected in the substantial parts thereof; The
Question now is, whither the drinking sulphurous waters, or wine, does most
conduce to the cure of this affect.

Avicenna adjudgeth the drinking of Thermall waters, either in a small, or great
quantity, to procure great difficulty in pissing, and though the grand
compression of such waters in a large proportion may force a stone, into the
pot, yet not without exceeding difficulty and agitation of settled humors, from
which violence, and forced motion proceeds excoriations, ulcers and various
distempers as dangerous and troublesome as the former obstruction, therefore in
this case white subtle wine that is not astringent, is better approved then
such waters; therefore in the right regiment of diet, in this distemper, white
wine is to be preferred before incertayne mineral tinctures, and if they were
certainly known, and perfectly separated, yet cannot the practice be justified
safe, because Natura non patitur afflictionem, and many rules admit exception,
so does this except against violence to nature; mineralls therefore, being in
their own nature more heterogeneall to animals, then any vegetall, must (though
most exactly prepared) offer violence to nature; as for the stone in the
bladder, I shall join with Paracelsus and his nil nisi cultrum and prescribe
no other remedy, but the knife. For other medicines of several forms and
matter, though Capevactius drew me over his discourse with many score probats,
yet is forced with this parenthesis to conclude. Sed ingenue fateor me nescire
quid potest lapidem vesicae frangere, Mercurialis in a flux of blood from the
Rhenes advises, abstinence from Wine omnino, and in the place ordayneth
calybrate water, which is a poor corroborative in a grand flux, and expense of
spirit continually, nor is it incrassative, or corrective, of acrimonie,
tenuity, and sharpnes of humors, being the principal causes of such distempers
(except eruption, or perforation of the urine) therefore under favor, I shall
as boldly and more reasonably (I suppose) ordain the use of black, and thick
wine, not only to incrassate, and dulicifie the humor in the first causes, but
as a better sanative in eruption of the urine, and for the refreshment, and
refection of spirit, more reasonably to be adhibited, then any calybeate
water, though better prepared with the juice of pomegranats and quinces; In
our subsequent discourse, we cannot avoid the bladder, as one of the
forenamed receptacles of liquid humors, and having before determined the only
cure of the stone generated in this part, by a petrefiring quality conferring
thereunto, I shall diluci'dly, with out prolixity, render my sense concerning
the suppression difficulty, stillicide, or voiding urine by drops, these being
proper diseases of the bladder, though diversely contracted, from other vicine
parts, causally, but subjected in the bladder, as subjectum been dispositum, to
receive such confluences, the number and differences of such causalls will
offer too much prolixity for this short undertaking, for an iscuria or
suppression of urine, admits of very much dispute in medicall schools, about
the causes essential, and accidental, therefore I shall only pass to the
proper remedies of such affect so caused. Hippoc: ^. Aph. ^4.
Hippoc: tells me that all cold qualities are enemies to the bladder from
whose testimony those remedies, which are applied to that part, must be
potentially hot, and if we consider the membranous substance, and exanguitie
of the part, we shall soon apprehend his reason, that all cold is highly
offensive to nervie substances, nor can there appear to my intellect any more,
then one scope of cure in all the forenamed diseases, and that is diereticall,
or such meat, or medicine as does not violently provoke, but gently move urine,
else one affliction is added to the other; therefore I shall present pure wine
as the most convenient, dyaretique, and without dispute, if the cause be as
cold, as the part. In order of place, the next Lecture must be of the diseases
of the penis, the word needs no other interpretation, there are not only such
affects, as labefact the bladder, but also such as vitiate the action of the
penis, I shall therefore relate those affects which hinder the proper action of
this part, for although it be dedicated to conveigh urine, out of the bladder,
yet most properly for the propagation, of the species, which cannot be effected
without erection, and ejaculation, the first may appear without the other, and
then propagation cannot succeed, which is demonstrated in this affect, which
we call Priapismus, which is an extension and erection of the penis, without
desire of Venerie; Concerning the tractation of this disease we cannot but
take notice of the name, as also the nature, the name I could never find in
Hipp: Galen. 6. ^e loc. afect. Cap. ^.
nor any other ancient writers (except Galen) by whom is rendered the derivation
of the name from Priapus who was much noted for the magnitude and extension of
this virile member, Gal 14. ^ethod. ^ap. 7.
't is also nominated Satyriasis, by Galen, and AEtius, leaving the reader to
take notice of the difference amongst writers concerning these terms, as to
prolix (especially) when they may receive better satisfaction from Egineta, and
Call. Aurel; therefore the nature of this affect, shall be my principal
consideration which consists in extension, and erection of the member without
power of ejaculation, though it does proced both from a seminal, as well as a
flatuent stimulation, this being the nature of the infirmity, I cannot conceive
the moderat use of generous Wine, for recovery, to be improperly indicated,
because it abolisheth all crudities, and indigestions which are causes of
flatulency, and does generate a lively blood which does effect powerful
matter: others there are which extract this affect from external causes, both
hot and cold, taking the ground of their opinion from brutes, which generally
forbear coition, or copulation in the winter and height of Summer; and because
universal temper of women, is more cold then of men; therefore their desires
are less in winter, and men more in Summer apt to Venerious action; in both
these causes, Arist. 4. Preblem.
the use of the fore named Wine is necessarily indicated, because the excessive
heat does dissipate the Central spirits to the circumference, by which the
concoctive faculty is so debilitated, as can effect nothing but such crudities
as are causes of flatulency, oppilation and putrefaction, which radical and
fluent spirits vagrant, are retracted, to the center by Wine and the parts
enabled to execute their offices; in the other case when the spirits are
almost extinct with excessive cold, the moderate use of this juice is the
cordial refreshment. The pains of the joints which are called Antriticall,
will beget a great dispute, or controversy, with vulgar practicers whither or
not, Wine may be granted, in such doloriferous affects in the joints,
confisting of the juncture of bones with nerves, which nervy substance, is the
sole capacity of these pains, as being the principal organs of exact sense,
and that sense of pain so extractive, as ordinarily does move, both spirits
and humors, with such violence, as does inflame themselves, and by the common
received opinion, Wine cannot but more inflame; and such vulgars do as often
and erroniously nominate these pains of the bones, though the bones are no
more sensible of pain then the nails, or hair in clipping, according to
Arist. Galen, and Avicen in many places; Arist. de part animal. 9. Gal. l. 16.

The causes internal of these articulate pains move upon one hinge of
Hippocrates, which he calls humors, and they must be congested extra locum,
and in themselves are more or less vicious; flatulency in this affect will
have no share by the consent of Mercurialis; and for my own sense of
Hippocrates in that place, it cannot express any other humor, then yellow
choler, or atred or a mixture of both, for phlegm by its viscosity and
crassitude, cannot penetrate such sensible sparts, nor can it effect any pain,
nisi dolor gravis which cause being granted, I shall make very good use of Wine
contra omnes gentes, for where there is any complication of phlegm, by reason
of its crassitude and gravitie, it abateth much the punctorious pain of the
article, but does effect more permanency of pain, because it cannot pass
through the pores by so quick exsudation; whither wine in this condition may be
conducible to the cure, and when, is the subsequent discourse, and a known
controversy in this case, therefore I shall rneder the sense of the most exact
writers, and then take boldness to present my own; Mercurialis with alothers
agree, that in the beginning of this distemper from a cholerique cause, no kind
of wine can be granted convenient, yet in the declension of the disease they
with Avicen do permit the use of it; how this decle^sion is to be apprehended
(under favor) is ambiguous, for I cannot understand this declination to be
such, as does fully determine the affect, for then their opinions signify
nothing, quia omnia Sana Sanis, and no rational Physician will forbid the
moderate use of wine, after a perfect recovery of the distemper, let it be of
what nature soever; therefore they must be understood of declension in statu
morbi; yet the proper wine that does correct that hot and bilious humor, and
with more celeritie, open the porositie, of the parts affected, cannot (except
puritanically) be ojbected against, neither in the beginning, State, nor
declination of the disease, arising from the foresaid bilious cause; as for the
complicate cause, I doubt not of the consent and samenes, of fence in
approbation of the moderate use of Spanish wine, that is subtle and old, but
in the thinner acrimonious cause, I have adhibited pure whit wine, and in a
large quantity, not only to correct that which was fixed, but to evacute that
which was fluent, both by urine and sweat, and by its narcotique quality, to
moderate the intolerable pain of the part, but where viscosity carries to
the part only a tincture of choler there I shall present Spanish wine, and it
is the ordinance of Rhasis in the gout of the feet proceeding from such cause,
Hipp. allows Vinum dulce in a bilious predominancy, but that, Hippoc. l. de
affect, intern.
but that book is taken from an ascript of the indian Physicians, who never
were excellent in the diaeteticall part of Physique, I shall now conclude all
these disputes with a putrid feavor, and then give some account of the best
modern consultations in particular cases, both hot and cold; The tractation of
feavors in their differences, would be of little consideration, because Galen
will have all acute diseases to be simply putrid feavors, Galen. 3. Cap. 8. de
differ. respir. lib. 1. de different. sebr. Cap. 3.
or conjunct with them, and it is a received opinion of the ancients, that al
feavors (except Ephemerall) are putrid, Hippoc. l. de vit. Medicina.
and Hippocrates will have neque Calidum, neque frigidum per se; to be the
cause of feavors, sed aliquid amarum, and acerbum, but a quality of salt or
bitter, or sharp predominancie; and therefore his sense is, that all febrile
heat, proceeds from the predominate motion of and alteration of pure humors,
to impurity, Galen, Plato, Athenaeus, are al of this fence, therefore it does
behoove Physicians to perpend not only the universal cause, and nature of
putrefaction, but also the reason of correction, which is my scope at present,
therefore with the ancients I apprehend putrefaction, to signify a mutation of
perfection or purity, to imperfection and impuritie, Galen. lib. 10. Meth. 8.
as when wine is changed to vinegar. Galen conceives, putrefaction to be a
mutation of the whole putrefying substance, and effected by external and
ambient heat, by which mutation Aristotle understands corruption, and by
Galen I (suppose understood a mutation to corruption,) therefore bodies are
less putreable in winter, then in summer, because external ambient heat is
then more minute, both in air, and water.

What reason we shall render of cure is the expectation of the reader, who will
as suddenly, take notice of my indication, properly extracted or deduced from
the nature of putrefaction; which according to Galen is the corruptible
disposition in humors from a cause either internal or external, and
accordingly, do present for a remedy omniquaque, dilute wine, not such as is
mixed with water, but such as in its own nature is more, or has more of the
aqueous, then vinous quality, and yet so naturally complexioned, as will
appear a corrective, or alterative, to praeternaturall siccity, and impure
humidity; ergo the consequence must be a roduction to harmony, quia Sanitas est
nil nisi harmonia, as also an apt prevention of putredinous distempers, which
according to the judgment of the ancients, do proceed from oppilation,
nothing being more moderately aperient then such wine, nor more tartarous;
therefore I have made observation of such persons, accustomed to the use of
wine, according to their age, and clime, or without such acception, not to have
bin subject to putrid feavors, nor can any person demonstrate wine, per se, and
specifically, ordained ever the mother of such mischief, though many have
suffered distempers fro excess, which is the vice of the best aliment and the
worst, yet such accidents fell not from the nature, or quality of wine (though
in excess) but from the present soporisique quality, which, with out
prevention, must succeed, and with cure for the best, for sleep stops all
evacuation (except sweat) and wine naturally moving from the center to the
circumference, and their negligent posture, in the ambient closing the porosity
of the body universally, by this power conjunct with the endeavor of nature,
to deliver it self, of a burden, does by its violent motion, in flame spirits
and consequently this febril distemper; putrefaction in this place and case, is
excepted, according to vulgar sense; nor can the subtilty of logique, being an
incommodum upon this vinose remoedy, Galen. 2. de acut.
Galen dot maintain the rationality of it as a remedy in putrid feavors, and
therefore commended the Italian mode in adhibiting in all feavors, Vinum
Sabinum, and confesses in the same first book Cap. 40. that himself was
accustomed to cure putrid feavors, after the same manner, and if any will take
notice of Hippocrates, not only in his book de acut, but in others, they shall
find my boldness in this practice grounded upon himself, whose soul I could
desire above all terrestriality, not that I desir only to act or cloth my self
with a part, or habit of a Physician, as players do the Persons of Kings and
noble Persons, no sooner disnobled and disrobed, but rogued; I am not ignorant
of the diversity of Medicall sects, not do condemn any (but mounters) but
from this digression I shall transire to those strict Physicians which do
condemn the use of wine, not only in this case but in all feavorish distempers,
but because they render no reason, I cannot judge their sect for Methodists
argue with reason, and Empericks a particulari (though not the best Logic) yet
if it be possible to bring them into the sect of rationalists I shall assist
the^ with this exception in Galen: Galen. Meth. 11. and 12. ad Glauc.
which is against the use of any wine, in these four subsequent cases, first
when the feavor is vehement, secondly, when there is a conjunct pain from the
head, the third is, in delirio, which is a deception of reason, and lastly,
when the origo of this putrid feavor is from, or does, follow an inflammation.

Under favor, the differences of wine observed, will respond all these
objections, as small dilute wine in all inflammations, and more liberally, or
in a larger dosse prescribed does abate, if not abolish all vehemence, and by
its soporifick quality does coligate the senses, and reconcile sleep, which is
the diminution of all vehement symptoms, delyration, and sharpest pains of
the head, which imperite Physicians, more dangerously force by opiate
preparations, and I shall conclude with the same Authority I began this
discouse, Galen. 11. Meth. 9. Galen. l. 1. de Antid. 3.
and render the affirmation of Galen, that this kind of wine, is most
convenient in putrid causes, to provoke urine, and concoct crudities, or
semiconcocted humors, and will not admit the mixture of water, more then it
receives from the plant; and this is the determination of the question,
concerning the application or use of wine in feavors; Now I shall proceed to
various affects, about which the most learned Modernes have consulted; whither
the use of wine in them might be conducible to cure, because some are hot, the
others cold distempers, and begin with a Jew that labored with Melancholy, his
temper hot and dry, from a vicious predominancie over the blood, his body
lean, color black, indisposed to sleep, prompt to all action, prone to anger,
of an excellent wit and discourse, but at this present Mute, and has bin so
these six days, his temper thus agreed upon, with his distemper, by a counsel
of Doctors; they now fix upon two scopes of cure, the one moistning, the other
opening obstructions, and in both, wine is concluded a proper remedy; There
was also another great consult about a Cannon of Rome, laboring with a feavor,
whither wine might be prescribed; about this point was much controversy, but
concluded, and adhibited the remedy; Nor do I read of any other Medicament in
all this consultation; sutation; In the next place, I present a young
Gentlewoman laboring with an Epilepsie, or falling sickness, her temper hot,
and moist, and so concluded in counsel, because they found her body fat, and
fleashy, in this case they determined the use of wine most convenient, for the
attenuation of humors, and corroboration of all noble parts; The same was
agreed upon for a young Spanyard in a burning feavor, in a great distillation,
pro Episcopo Lucensi; in various distempers pro Aloysio Foscareno; in vertigine
or dissines of the head, pro cive Lucensi; against al effects of the Rhenes and
bladder, pro Magnifico Contareno, with many others which were too prolix to
produce, enough being argued to instruct the use of wine, in all tempers, to be
most natural aliment, and in all distempers, as proper medicament, concluded by
the most learned, ancient, and Modern in Medicine; Thus far have I urged the
use of pure Wine, not that I am ignorant of the excellent advantage in medicall
wines, the ordinance of which is left to the judgment, and direction of the
present agent, my self passing now to every age and sex, to show the proper
use of wine for aliment in each, and the time when; my former discourse has
tended more to medicament then aliment, which is to be the subject of our
following discourse, though not so immixed but some vigencie may intervene.

Humane bodies, are not only obnoxious, daily to affects of air, diet,
exercize, passions of the mind etc: but also from our implanted, and internal
heat, which by degrees, more, or less, does dry up, and demolish our origenall
humidity, which in some sense arises out of it self, and by this perpetual
motion, is so consumed, as does effect many mutations, which are conscribed
with certain periods, and conversions of ages; for every animal newly
proceeding, or pullulant ex semine, and sanguine and compounded of its prime
humidity, is most humide, in whom all parts organicall, as bones, cartilages,
and flesh, are soft, tender, and flexible, which by progression in age, does
stiffen, dry, wither and consume, in the like mode, are the vicissitudes, and
mutations of temperaments, and distempers, with their conjuncts; therefore age
is but a motion measured out by time, in which the constitution of the body, by
it self is perspicuously changed; Six not able differences of ages, with their
temperaments, are to be observed; the first the child age, which extends from
the birth to the 14. or 15. year, and in temper, hot, and moist, and is more
hot, then ripe, and juvenall age, by reason of fixed heat, for by how much
nearer it is, to its original, by so much the more does it participate of
innate heat, contrarily, by how much it does receed from its first principles,
by so much is the innate heat exhausted; And this age, one of the ancients
divides into four orders, infancy, dentity, and media between these, and ripe
age, and lastly puberty, which presents it self aptly to be discoursed, as
the second age in the order of nature; This age of puberty begins at the
fiveteenth year, and is extended to the eighteenth, and is less moist, but
more hot; The third age is adolescency, which begins at the nineteenth year,
and is extended to twenty five, and of a moderate temper; The fourth age is
juvenil, or flourishing young age, which begins at the 25. year and
extends to thirty five, and is more hot and dry in temper then the precedent
age; The fifth age is virill and the media between young and old age yet does it
not so participate of either, as to affect, or intemperate it, as it begins
at thirty five, so it extends to forty nine; The last is old age, which by
the expense of natural heat in temper is cold and dry, the moisture being
excrementitious, by reason of languishing and decayed heat; This last age, as
the first does admit of division into these three parts, the first is fresh old
age, beginning at fifty, and extends to sixty, and all this time is
serviceable to the country in execution of Offices, which may comply with their
former education, the second age is a media, or middle old age, beginning at
sixty, and extending to seventy, and in this age most men are unserviceable for
their country, or selves; the last decrepid age, beginning at seventy, and is
commonly extended to eighty; and with this age our terrestical being and life
is concluded; not but some extraordinary purity in the principals of some
individualls, which may cause a larger extention of life; These are the common
differences of humane age, the first ingresse hot and moist, the last egresse,
cold and dry, the middle temperate and proved so to be by every sense; And thus
is the life of man, Job.
which springs up like a flower and with a short duration in one State,
circled out a puncto, ad punctum, and shall render it probable by art, to
extend man's life, and preserve it from the severity of some distempers,
conveyed in the natural principles of their mixture, commonly received for
distempers hereditarie; and defense to be caused by the right use, and
application of this juice, from which familiarity with universal nature, life
is extended beyond all expectation; which is such a defensitive in weak
tempers, as does enable to resist facible assaults, conveyed in materia
spermatica. The best opportunity of effecting such undertaking, is ab
incunabolis, or from the breast of the mother and so proceed from temper to
temper, as they admit of mutation, in their several ages, otherwise, the
universal temper may be so injured, as spoiled, by antecedent irregularity,
both of diet, and medicine, as will cause great difficulty in future
undertakings; for though much advanage of time be gained, yet the perfection of
cure, or full satisfaction of the creature, will not be obtained. I could
render an Empyricall argument from my own affect which was then an Atrophia
totius corporis, or consumption of the whole body, and left by the most perite
Physicians as incurable; my valitudinary temper then, being until the age of
thirty years, affrighted at the sight of one glass of wine, being a strict
observer of such advice, as must be accounted more learned, then my own young
studies could produce; but when I was left to my free choice, of any thing my
reason could present, or appetite require, upon those grounds of Philosophy
which I had meditated, I did cast my Anchor at the root of this plant, and by
the constant use of the juice recovered in the space of twelve months
perfection of cure, and have in such state of health continued twenty and two
years after, and void of a consumptive disposition to this day, and have in
many others since observed such levamen as in a latitude, may be esteemed a
cure; and the right use and application of this juice cannot be denied, in
purity to exceed all spermatique humors, sucked either from women, or breasts,
according to ancient and more modern practive; This is a Nectar, and Ambrosia
for Princes and as pleasant contemplation for Physicians, learnedly to
undertake the practice of it; for as this life may be said to be the unum
necessarium, because upon this point eternite does, or may depend, and that the
lives of Kings are more considerable, then other Individualls, as being the
souls of their Kingdom and people, it cannot but encourage the study of all
Physicians, for the particular, and common safety, and preservation of this
Jewel, to endeavor a right understanding of the use, and application of the
blood of the grape; and the most learned, in their highest contemplations,
shall find this subject worthy of their industry, as their exceeding
expressions, above this my velle, will hereafter manifest; if I should relate my
many difficult, and disputable cures, of my own effecting, in a multitude of
severalls, it might not only seem ostentative, but also an act of injustice,
and non integrity to others to publish persons with their imperfections,
committed to my cure, and secrecy; nor is testimony in this case of such
absolut necessity, where the point is rationally cleared, and consented unto,
by the most learned fathers, and Shoolemen in the faculty of Medicine; upon
which ground I shall desire credit, and esteem in the first place, and so
return from my digression, to my proper subject, and try whither I can make it
suitable to all ages; The infant age is the first, and most difficult to
reconcile, because Galen says, according to the colection of Frabesarius,
vinum infantibus fit nocivum, because their temper is hot and moist, but
suerely he was better acquainted with the sense, and soul of Galen, to conceive
him speaking of the specifical difference of such wine, as is indicated for
nutriment in this age, for then he must challenge him of such misunderstanding
of Philosophy, as not to comprehend, mixed bodies to be supported and
nourished, by their simile, and force him ignorant of ijs nutrimus, quibus
constamus, or that such mixed qualities properly applied, are unapt, or
insufficient in their own nature, to assimilate with their identitie, or
samenes, as is the mixture of wine, to our material principles of nature; but
Galen cannot be understood of the quality, but super exceeding quantity, which
as too much oil does extinguish the Lamp, or disturb it by moving some other
heterogeneal which by the true support of wine nature had been able insensibly
to have disposed otherwise, for had the nature of wine in it self appeared to
Hippocrates abnoxions he would never have ordained the dieting of children in
the stone either of the rhenes or bladder ad hereditary to consist of white
wine rather then milk nor was he ignorant that hereditary diseases were
Communicated to the children any otherwise then in their spermatick principles,
nor that wine in it self and its own nature could be disagreable in the
support of those principles, or to foment and maintain their constitutions,
with out any morbificall motion or alteration, my self has also much used it
in affects of the same nature and in many other with exceeding approbation from
sucesse, nor can I conceive wine hurtful to any temper of it self without the
misapplication and indiscretion of the agent not knowing the specificall
differences and mode or use, by these expressions (I presume) the understanding
reader to have received satisfaction for the first age and that it is absolved
from the former prohibition and at liberty freely to make use of wine, now I am
to present a health to the next order which we called pubertie, this temper
being more hot, and less moist then the former yet by such wine as does
contemper the heat, and add to hte moisture, that wine will and must prove
properly useful to this age, the time when and quanteties how much as well as
the quanteties ought to be directed by the physician, who must necessarely obey
his indications and proper scopes, Adolescency being of a middle temper and
predominancy neither hot nor cold nor moist or dry, will moderately and with
observation of time, clyme, and quanteties, admit of white, clarret and
rhenish wines with out any fear, Iuventus being of a temper more hot and dry
must with the former aspects apply it self to the forenamed wines, and if they
sensibly appear not sufficiently moistning, 't is sooner effected by the
addition of fountain water. Verile age from thirty five to forty nine
broatcheth a vessel of more rich clarret and passes out with a taist of the
smallest sack which senectus makes, Bolonia wine.
more strong by more rith sack, muscadins and aligants, and continues their
use to the utter extent and period of life, having thus applied it to every age
and cleared my proposition, the next consideration will concern the sex, male
and faemale, which though some have more out of curiosity then utillity
differenced their tempers, most of their litigation being de lana Caprina or
the various temperaments of sexes affirming women must of necessity be selled
in the left side, and therefore more debill and cold then men, which if it be
granted for the satisfaction of such fancy, yet my observation is with out any
difference so a liene, and my opinion in the point, is also that temperaments
are not conflate out of heat more obtuse, or vehement (though it may signify
some thing ingestation) but depend on the perfusion and consent of the four
elements, therefore having formerly more distinctly discoursed of temperaments,
I have also included sexes, and now pass to the mode of useing this subject,
all my former labor has been a Phylosophical extraction and separation of
wine, in its principles and medically taught the familiar use, both for aliment
and medicament, not doubting its general acceptance, and were it not agreeable
in the same sense to such use I shall ingeniously acknowledge my non
understanding of Aristotle his alimentm simile and dissimile for although all
aliment of het coldest quality must receive a form of heat before it can be
produced into a nutritive act, yet is there no such form or substance so
trancible and naturally disposed to sanguification and nutrition as the blood
of the grape, and an augmentation of radical moisture or inuates heat may be
granted, their can be nothing in humane conception more apt to effect it, for
it is oleagenous and a just proposition fomenteth the flame, which aquositie does
extinguish, so as it is the true nectar, by the use where of the principles of
life are augmented, natural humors multiplied, spirits created and refreshed,
strength restored, care expelled, and juvency or youthfulness concerved, to
conclude, it is the all to a natural body, for aliment in general is and by
common consent granted to be liquid ayrie, and sold which qualities are the
complement of this juice, I have also proved it a convenient medicament in the
most difficult and disputable affects of the body and if I should recomend the
excess of pure wine, or an operative dosse once every month the Arabian
Physician will justify my Ordinance, as has appeared by their own practice and
self custom affirming it to recreat the animal faculties, reconcile sleep
provoks urine and sweat, dissolve superfluities and a certain cure in a
quartain fever with many other distempers, circumstances conducible observed,
which circumstances I have given notice of in the precedent discourse, and
resolved to entertain this time with substance, only take notice of custom to
be in a latitude or some consideration substantial, because it over rules or
comprehends as a second nature both time and clyme, and there are some as
necessary accommodations to the right use of this aliment as condiments are to
ntritive substances of an other condition, as principally the direction of, and
consult with the Physician, for let the temper or distemper be of any nature
(except gangranous, or wounds vicerat, by his right and proper application they
shall sensibly perceive a refreshment and prolongation of life, without which
nothing is pleasant to universal nature, for what is aliment with out an
appetite or land, when the owner can not trample it, or any other delight to an
incapacity; The chimical sect urge the pleasantness of their extract as a
grand beauty in their medicine, but here I present a safety and pleasantness
transcending all mineral opperations, and effected by an undoubted regiment of
fire, and to be preferred Prince of all other vegitalls; excess in this juce
may be more easily repaired, and the distemper more speedely and inoffencively
reduced to harmony, the principal difficulty will be in obteining pure wine with
out sophistication, for which cause, I can cordially kommend, as much as desire
the Scottish severity established, amongst the English nation, and that the
Sophisticatiors of wine, may suffer punishment above any ordinary thief, as not
only picking the purse of all nations, but with a secret venene mixture
paynfully afflicting them, and often irrecoverably, no vetrickle being so
proper to conveigh any malignity or venomous quality to the universal spirits
of any creature then wine, if I shall dispute further, some may take me up for
prolixity, and others stop me for a non visitavit, well knowing that Galen:
with his commentary upon the Aphorisimes translated, urges that wine as venus
does debilitate innervate, and Frambesarius will according to the Frensh mode
exalt a mess of pottage Frensh, beyond a chine of English beef and therefore
adds these insignifica^t (Scil) vinum venusque nocent eodem modo and if he
or any other understand or undertake Galen: in that literal sense, they must
confute him beyond Johannes Argenterius with whom I left Ranchnius his
Countriman at foyles, and leave it to those of leisure or standers by, to
divulge the victory, but if in that litteral sense apprehended the objection I
confess is instar ommium whether it be taken for the use, or excess of wine,
and in the first sense it will affront greater artists, and in the second
opposite to the Arabians which has told the Graecians and other opposits that
their Countty is their disgrace, and those ostentators a disgrace to their
Country, Avicenna, Rhasis, and Averrhoes advise it usque ad Ebrietatem, the
challeng is high and whither they have measured their weapons (I know not) but
if Galen be not understood to speak of Ebriety, then neither the use of wine
or women can either debilitate or be abnoctious, for both in their orderly mode
are of much utility and concernment, the one to preserve the individual, the
other the propagation of the species, the first has been largely disputed, the
last which concerns propagation not to be effected, but by an act venerial,
which Avicenna in a melancholic predominance condemns, but in his 20 and 3
chap: Avicen: 1. Tract. 3. Cap 4.
de juvamentis Coitus (says) that the use of venerie does most help the
melancholist, which opinion was accepted before from Paulus Aegineta in his
first book de rebus veneriis, by which it will appear in Avicen: contradiction
of himself, and to redeem him out of such incommoduments; let us perpend some
passages of Galen: Galen. 6. Epid. Coment 5. Text 25.
where he affirms mixtion to restrain diseases in fieri or in their motion,
and Galen: will not admit of any other interpretation of Hipp: but that mixtion
and Coition are of the same signification and amongst other affects does
digitate melancholy, affirming moderate Coition or use of venerie to be a
specific remedy, (especially proceeding from vapors of combust humors) and
with out question upon this consideration, the moderate use of Venus is a
considerable adjuvant, but if we understand, or accept those fit subjects of
such remedy, as are affected by pungent vapors from a predominancy of natural
melancholy, this flatulencie being more cold (though provocative) in this
sense the use of venerie does prove verry adverse, and in this sense I
understand Avicen: and the exception in Galen: principally to reflect upon,
both quantity and quality unseasonably applied, both in respect of time and
temper, as when the wine is inspecificall to the temper or quantity exceeding a
natural capacity and upon an empty body ubi vacuis committere venis nil nisi
lene decet, and then immoderately to exercise the act of venery, after such a
mode both wine and women are innervations and great consumptives of sixth and
fluent spirits, and where Plato and Ambrosius have an exception I apprehend it
only of the nimium, which is intoxication or ebriety in a voluptuous course
which does obnubulate reason and sense rendering the person inferior to a mere
animal and a vice reproved by all rationales not only as it is pernicious to
the body, inflaming the blood, debilitating the nerves and afflicting the head,
but as a privation of reason which is the form of man and by which he
preceadeth all other terrestrial creatures; but I am not of opinion, that
those Arabian Princes, did ever use wine in such a voluptious manner
themselves, or advised it to others but medically, as will appear by their
monthly prescription, upon proper indication, preferring wine before any other
medicine, because of its operate power, so familiarly respondent to nature.
This objection being cvleared I shall move to the last extracted from sacred
scripture. There are a prevalent sect in England and other places where they
have gained permission, that stiffely defend with inconsiderable logic, that
the fatality of man's life and actions and such considerations, are but as the
judgment of men which is foolishness with God, because (say they) no man can
be in life or fortune preserved, prolonged, assisted, or restored to either,
because diseases with all their Concomitants are, or must be inflicted by an
inexpugnable necessity determined of the Almighty and immutably fixed, and the
closest council of God, have such close clipped considerations of their
opponents, as if with out spectacles they could not see their lowsy Crowns, or
not discern them ridicalous to intellectual persons, and pernicious to all
Kingdoms and just people thereof, upon this pretended ground of Religion they
murder, steal, betray innocents, perjure themselves, rebel against God,
their King and country, supposing no eye can see the Pharisaicall paths they
walk in, nor that they keep in memory the old cheat of the grand Pharisie,
who made it a damnable sin for the publican to dress meat upon the Saboth,
and the same Hyppocrite, upon the same day made a great feast and invitation to
our (Lord and Savior) that he might obtain advantage of his discourse, and in
a Traterous undertaking (says he) 't is lavvfull to break a Comman dement,
for such a breatch of command and treachery at this or that time was, and is by
the inevitable ordinance of the Almighty, and if God shall command otherwise
they are Leviathans and will acknovvledge no supreme above naturam naturatam
and without control do what they please as does daily appear (amongst the
rest of their cheates) their blasphemous fastnings and prayers, which is
nothing but a plain mocking of omnipotency, or a request to deny his own
commands, for if he vvil not give a contrary command to murder, theft,
adultery, perjury, or disobedience and disloyalty, their actions bid defiance,
and tell, in spite of his will or power they will do it, as giants of
force to unthrovvn the Gods, and then they use Demetrius his faemenine weapons
to slay their uxorious husbands, and then the people must be cheated with the
pretense of Religion and the name of God, which themselves must take in to
their declarations (though they hate Reformation) and persuade the people upon
this hyppocriticall ground, that it is but a superfluous curiosity of some fine
woven bbravnes, to avoid contagion, or to seek remedies correcting or curring
affects (yet their blasphemous prayers and fasting shall never effect) or to
arm themselves against their enemies and for the same reason that God
foreseeth death of every mode in time shorter or longer and his irrisistable
order in such motion to be in a voidable, and yet the same omnipotent, bath
declared to all humane nature, that the perdition of every person is of him
self, otherwise he can be no delinquent in his justice, if by a supreme power
inevitably obliged to such actions or passions: how pernicious and impious this
heretical doctrine appears to reason and common sense is understood, (except
such intellect as apprehend nothing either of reason or sense, but that which
is beaten in to their skulls with apoleaxe) and whosoever allows this error
must of necessity disalow of that form of prayer for our daily bread, ordered
by our Savior to be an inscience in him and a piece of Rebellion against his
aeternal Father in such a resistance of his established will, as also all the
divine prayers for the prolongation of life, and preservation from danger,
ordered by his Apostles and their successors, as also the dispensation of the
gift of healing to the Physician. If all diseases and dissolutions of every
knide be so imuiovably predestined as cannot admit of any remedy, or to what
end or purpose did the almighty omniscient, create and honor the Physician, to
render the reason will silence Mr. Speaker and both houses of Parliament,
therefore under favor of more learned interpretors of learning in these
points, I shall do my own endeavor rationally to expurge this pernicious and
intolerable error concerning divine providence, and to this purpose, some
thing concerning his caelestial administration of universalls, are to be taken
in to consideration, and repeated, by which the dignity and eximious utillity
of medicine may be more clearly demonstrated. That therefore the vicissitudes
and actions of things and humane nature, are not by chance, but by the
ordination of the Almighty, ought to be a principle embraced by all Christian
people, and that God is the omnipotent and aeternall fabricator of the whole
universe out of nothing as is affirmed by divine testimony, this aedifice
being so powerfully erected is also by the same efficacy conserved, who has
also appointed to every created thing, both a beginning and end, or termination
of subsisting and moving, and does take notice not only of principal but also
of subsequent causes of things, as if that God did govern, moderate, dispose
and order them, according to his free will, and yet all this government is void
of fatal violence, and most commonly comes to effect, mediately, and from
deputed causes, which vulgarly are nominated second causes, which the divine
Majesty does employ as the instruments of his will, so long as he does so
govern all things which he has created, as also him self may suffer them to
exercise their proper motions, for the will of man by divine ordination is the
original of humane actions, freely electing what seems best for it self
(especially in externalls) and the nature of motion is the cause of this or an
other thing in which it is per se, according to Aristotel as in the Sun
perpetual rotation, and in grave and beavy bodies their inclination to their
Center, and the causes so respond the effects, as if the effects be necessary
the causes are also necessary, and if contingents, the causes are contingents,
nor does the praescience which is certain and not to be deceaved, abolish the
contingency of natural events, but the future effect is disposed as it were by
a divine providence necessarily or contingently, nor does it null the freedom
of the agent, nor is the creator obliged to the necessity, but moderateth al
things freely according to his free will and pleasure, as did evidently appear
when he caused the sun to stand still, or move retrograde the space of one
complete day, and caused the red Sea to divide and stand like firm wales,
without either flux or reflux or any motion that we read of, until the
Israelites had passed over them, as also in the case of Daniel, and the three
children in the fiery furnace, and Duffus Milcolumbus King of Scots who was
most barberously murdered Anno Dom: 961. after which according to their own
history there was no apperance either of the Sun or moon for the space of six
months, and though divine omnipotency can dispos of causes and life with every
kind of death at his own free pleasure, yet it will not urge any person to
accept, that term of life for a fatal determination, but for a divine
ordination of servient causes and their natural power of sustaining or
corrupting life, for since life (according to the Philosopher) is in its self
but a duration of heat conjunct with moisture, which duration of vital heat
and extinction of the same are natural effects, depending upon natural
causes, which doubtless, because of the various disposition of internal heat
and moisture, complicated which external causes, not only the quality, but
also the quantety of life it self may be varied, for it does obteyn the
internal condition of lively principles, so long as the heat and moisture are
so united in animals, that one is not destroyed or perturbed by the other so
long they subsist, but either of them separated each from the other perish, and
in whom soever innate heat is more vegetious and strong, and radical moisture
more pure in substance and exceeding in quantety, recipient of a just temper
which is temperamentum ad justitia, in such life is more durable and permanent,
and if any inquiery shall be made into causes of long life, in the forefathers
to the years of nine hundred and more they will grant the internal purety of
principles to be the causes of such extension of life, and successively
abreviated by time, in which matter suffiety decay, as not possessive of the
prime purety, therefore in these ages the countess of Desmond, and Thomas
Parre are extraordinary exemples, for ordinary old age is threescore and ten,
if one climicterick more it must be effected by the extraordinary power and
purity of radical principles: for radical heat is the principal agent of
generation, in the liquid substance of seed and blood in the first conception,
soon after renders it more dry, and delineateth the rudiments of every member,
and by a farther siccity, does publish the exact species, and after its
production into the world, it does bring it to perfection, and by the continuat
efficiency of this heat the parts are so exiccated above a moderate proportion,
as does render them less (if not unable) to perform their proper functions,
by which there does follow a necessity of decay, and extinction of natural
heat, and this is a natural death (according to-Galen) which by reason of
extreme siccity, and non nutrition, this natural progress to old age without
any sense of pain vanishes in a regular motion, from generation to corruption
and decay, and is unnatural and violent when by any other internal, or
external cause is extinct, before this natural motion to extreme old age
which by a skillful order may be prolonged against internal causes (except a
depraved will) which destroys many individuals which no reason can deny in
capeable of extreme duration one story I remember of a discontented gallant
which drowned himself, and being much lamented by the spectators for youthful
comeliness, amongst them was one of this erroneous sect which was pleased to
read a lecture to them of the inevitable dicree of the Almighty and not by him
to be avoided nor by them lamented, Ayong man (of the contrary education) gave
her a great blow over the face, which made her challeng him of base Cowardice,
and as great incivillity to the femenine sect, who returned her in answer, that
it was the in evitable will of God it should be so, and a truth according to
her own doctrine, which caused her to stagger in her opinion leaving this
digression, I must return to my Phylosophicall discourse of heat and moisture,
so united as waisteth no otherwise then by their own natural motion with out
disorderly injuries of physic or diet, therefore do proceed upon the simile of
Hippocrates, by which he compares the life of man to a lamp or candel,
preserved in a temperate place, free from any tempest in such a place the
candel will extend to the last spark of fire or moisture, otherwise by any
tempestious or violent assault, of any kind it is extinguished before it be
half lighted, or if its halbe moved gently in a large (though not tempestious
air) yet that motion being more immoderate will cause it to blaze out some
hours before otherwise it would in a temperate posture, the like injuries and
praeternaturall assaults to humane bodies, are plagues, wounds and al other
distempers, some peracutes suddenly extinguishing life, others abreviating,
and the least and mildest distemper obteineth such immoderate motion of spirits
as in such a digre does expend a portion of natural heat and moisture, as does
according to that digree abreviate life, the first violence compelling nature
suddenly to yield up all power of motion, the latter effecting the same
cunctando, I cannot but confess, as matter admits generation, so is there a
compulsive necessity of suffering corruption nor can the heart be made moister
being extremely excicated by its motion to old age, yet no sober spirit, can
conceive it a point of wisdom or religion in a careless, negligent, or
desperate way, to render up their being in this life, before an irrisistable
necessity for this is like beasts to be led, or fools to lead ourselves to
slaughter, Thus have I done my in deavour to clear this last objection and to
discharge the fatality of man's life of all future quaestion, nor the extention
of it by care and counsel to extreme old age, and by no such natural means
as wine, and if I should proceed further to every cercumstance conducible to
the practical part, it would be a work of long time which I cannot spare, and
of exact judgment, wherein I could be content to receive directions, from
guides more quick sighted and learned then my self. That which I have now
written is according to my own reason and desire, to give more satisfaction to
the world concerning the use of this vinose subject, which has been doubtful
and in all ages quaestionable, both in respect of the life of man, whether or
not it may be extended, or whether it be extensible as also in respect of wine,
whether their proper nature be so extending, as in all the former dicourse has
been my labor to demonstrate, by arguments both a priore and a posteriore,
and by such argumentatio^ to in counter those fantastic sculs, that either
cannot, or will not conceive the medecinal art, to be established upon any
other ground (except conjecture) and that the best conjecture is the best
Physician, not understanding that pathognomik symtomes demonstrate the affect,
as plainly as any other shadow does either man or beast, none that has eyes
will take the shadow of man for a horse, nor of an ox, for a rhinosoros, or a
lion, for a bear, to such as these I do not direct this my Philosophy, nor can
I conceive where there are such infinities of faces, their should not also be a
variety of opinions, therefore I cannot hope to satisfy every fancy nor do I
intend to be understood of the vulgar, but leav my justification to the
natural sons of art, and to such are these my endeavors presented, an
oblation after the manner of those divote children, which where accustomed once
every year to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter, but at the accustomed time being by
an inexpected inundatio^ prevented, both of their altar and Sacrefice, instead
of a beast, they offered a lemon which Jupiter accepted in that necessitious
condition, so also those that have read my precedent Tract of waters, cannot
conceive my head free from washing, nor my brains from such inundation, as
consequently may not dilute my wine and render it more weak and impure, yet if
my devotion may be acceptable to Jupiter, let it be blessed to the world, and
where as (like the dog of Hercules) I have be smeered my lips with the Crimson
juce of the grape, other Herculian brains, may vent it in more pure, and
plentiful in substance and measure, by which every sense shall be refreshed,
every capacity filled, and every intellect really delighted.
