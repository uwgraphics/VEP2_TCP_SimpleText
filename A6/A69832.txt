1 That the end why the Saints receive all Glorious Grace, is, That they may be
one, as the Father and Christ are one. 2 That God the Father loves the
Faithful, as he loves Jesus Christ. 3 That our Savior desires to have the
Faithful in Heaven with himself. 4 That the Happiness of our being in Heaven,
is to see Christ's Glory. 5 That there is much wanting in the Knowledge of Gods
Love, in the most able Saints. 6 That the Lord Christ lends daily Direction,
according to the daily need of his Servants. 7 That it is the desire and
endeavor of our Savior, that the dearest of Gods Love, which was bestowed on
himself, should be given to his faithful Servants. 8 That our Union and
Communion with God in Christ, is the top of our happiness in Heaven.

THE FOURTH BOOK OF PRACTICAL PHYSIC.
Of Women's Diseases.
THE FIRST PART.
Of Diseases in the Privities of Women.
THE FIRST SECTION.
Of Diseases of the Privy Part, and the Neck of the Womb.
Chap. 1. Of the straitness and largeness of the Orifice.
THERE are three Diseases in this Part. The straitness, and the largeness, and
the Yard of a woman.

The straitness is, when the cleft is so narrow, that it will not admit of a
man^ Yard, or with much difficulty, it hinders childbearing; and if it be from
the first conformation, it is hard to be cured by Physic, but i^ is enlarged,
either by copulation, or by bring^ng forth of children. Sometimes it is from an
^lcer, or from astringent Medicines given unadvisedly, that they may appear to
be Virgins, when they are not.

Sometimes the cleft is shut up outwardly, and there is only passage for the
urin and the terms; these women are called Atret^e, that is shut up^ not bored,
of which Chap. 3. Sometimes it is so close, that neither terms nor urine can
com^ ^orth.

The contrary to this, is largeness of the cle^t, or when there are more holes
then Nature has usually, by often copulation or childbearing. This laxity or
largeness causes barrenness and falling out of the womb, as Hippocra^es sh^ws
in the Nature of Women. And this makes women unpleasant to men.

This is cured by purging after childbearing, by Fomentations, Baths, Liniments
of Alum water, and the Decoction of astringent Plants.

Take Com^rey roots, Bole, Sanguis Draconis^ Pomegranate flowers, Alum,
Mastich, Galls, each half a dram; make a Powder, and with steeled Wa^er make a
Mixture, dip a Pessary therein. Or, Tak^ O^ken leaves, Plantane, each half a
hand^ul; Com^r^y roots an ounce, ^om^granate pe^ls and flowers, Sumach, each
half an ounce; Alum an ounce, boy^ them in water, and ^oment the privi^ies.

Sometimes in hard tr^vel, the space between the fundament and the p^ivie cle^t,
ar^ brok^n into one hole. Ero^ shows the Cure o^ i^. Some ^
pu^ a long pie^e of All^m into the ^le^t. When ther^ are diverse passages in a
woman's priv^ties, it i^ from the first conformation, when by Natur^^ error the
passage from the straight g^t goes to the womb.

Chap. 2. Of the Mentula, or Yard in a Woman.
THe Al^e or wings in the privities of a w^man^ are of soft spungy ^lesh, like
a Cocks comb in shape and color; the part at the top is hard and nervous, and
swells like a Y^rd in Venery, with much Spirit. This part sometimes is big as a
man's Yard, and such women were thought to be turned into men.

It is from too much nourishment of the part, The (...)
from ^he looseness of it by often handling.

It is not safe to cut it off presently, but first use The (...)
dryers and discussers, with things that a little astringe, then gentle
Causticks without causi^g pain, as burnt Alum, Aegyptiacum.

Take Aegyptiacum, Oil of Mastich, Roses^W^x, ea^h half an ounce. If these will
not do, the^ ^^t it off, or tie it with a ligature of Silk or Horsehair, till
it mortisie.

Aetius teaches the way of amputation, he c^ls (...) 10^.
it the Nympha or C^itoris, between both the wings, but take heed you cause not
pain ^r i^^lammation. After cutting, wa^h with Win^, with M^rtles, Bays, Roses,
Pom^granate flow^^s ^oyled in it, and Cypress-nu^s and lay on an (...) Po^der.

Some excrescences grow like a tail, and fill the privities: they differ from a
Clitoris, for the desire of Venery is increased in that, and the rubbing of the
clothes upon it cause lust, but in an excrescence of flesh, they cannot for
pain endu^^ copulation, but you may cut off this better then a Clitoris,
because it is all superfluous.

Chap. 3. Of Atretae or Closures, and straitness of the neck and mouth of the
Womb.
THey are three^old: it is either in the ori^ice, or the neck, or in the
middle, it is always huttful, either to copulation or the terms, or to
conception and childbearing.

I saw one that had the first: the ori^ice was very little, only fit to purge
the terms, and receive seed, she conceived, and the Midwives discovered in time
of childbearing, and the Surgeon opened it, and she was happily delivered,
but how the seed was spent into it, is not to be understood.

Lib de abd sana. and morb. cau. c^p^ 78.
Flesh or a membrane is from evil conformation, or a wound, or ulcer, of which
Benivenius, (...) and Hildanu^.

The ^le^t also may be closed by a wound o^ ulcer, as in a woman who with the
French ^ox had all eaten off, and it grew together after, only there was a
little passa^e for urin.

This is, either when the sides grow togeth^^ f^^m a^ u^cer, or ^hen proud
^le^h ^^ops it u^^ which is sometimes in the French pox.

When it is in the privities, it is to be seen, but The Signs
^hen in the neck or ori^ice of the womb, it is not ^nown, but when the terms
are to ^low, or when ^hey copulate; and it is either broken by the ^orce of
blood, or there is pain; and being vir^ins, they are taken to be with child,
for i^ it ^ast long the womb swells, and the whole body is ^lewish.

These either hinder the term^ from the neck ^f the womb, or from the veins of
it. If in^lam^ation or ulcer was before, this disease may be ^uspected to be;
if there the closing be by the membrane the place is white, if by ^le^h, it is
red, and it is known by the touch, for the membrane ^s ^arder then flesh.

The inconveniences are great either in copulation, The Prognostic.
conception or child bearing especially, for the child cannot get forth without
hazard of it self or mother.

It is easier cured when it is from a membrane only, because it is easily cut
or broken, that in ^he orifice of the womb is not to be cured, because the
instruments cannot reach it.

Take away that which stops the passage, a The Cure.
membrane that is outward is easily cut, but i^ it be in the neck of the womb
or be flesh, it is hard, for if the cut be large there is pain and b^e^ding,
and the wound is hard to be cured, because the ne^k of the bladder is easily
hurt thereby.

(...) teaches this operation in his Observations. And Hippocrates in his Book
of Sterility sh^ws how a membrane may be taken away without cutting.

I^ ^^e^h grow from an ul^^r a^t^r purging, use d^^ers and discussers, to
dimi^i^^ it: ^ith Fr^nkincense, Birthwort, Roses, Pomegranate flowe^s, (...)
My^r^, Aloes, etc. as in Chap. 2.

(...)
Some think this disease may come from dri^^ss, but it is incredible. I^ it
come stom a hard tun or, soften and dissolve it with Butter, Oil of swee^
Almonds, Lillies, etc.

Chap. 4. Of Pustles and Roughness of the Privities.
ROughn^ss and Itching come from Pustles in the n^ck of the womb and privities
^ith scurff and swellings which i^ch and pain.

The Causes
They are from an adust humor mali^nant and sharp, which abounding evacuate
themselves by th^se loo^e and moist parts, and there sti^king, exasperate the
flesh, this is in the French pox.

The Sign^.
They ^^c^are it themselves.

The P^^gnostick.
It is stubborn, long, and in^e^tious to men, and hard to be cured.

The Cure.
I^ the adust sharp humors come from the whol^ body, prepare with Bora^e,
Fumitory, Succory, Endive and the lik^, then evacuate t^^m wi^h Senna^
Epithymum, syr^p of Apples, Viol^^^, Roses, Catholicon, Consectio h^me^h, ^il^s
of Fumitory, Tartar.

Let blood i^ there be ^ulness, first in the Arm, then in the Ankle, but if it
be from the Fren^h pox, first u^e Guajacum and S^^^a and the like.

Foment the ^a^t often with a hot dec^ction o^ (...) F^^i^ory, H^ps P^lli^^^y,
o^ u^e this Oyntm^nt. Take (...) and Rose (...) ^^ch (...) ^^nce^; S^l gem,
N^^^r, Alum, ^ach thr^^ dr^ms; Sub^i^^^^ a (...) and half, boy^ t^^m ^o the
third part, strain them, and add Verdigrease a ^^ruple: then use gentler means
two days after till the Pustles fall off and new flesh appear, and then use
the Ointment again.

Let the diet be to resist evil humors, of good ^uy^^, avoid salt sharp and
^our things.

Chap. 5. Of Condyloma in the neck of the Womb.
COndyloma is a tubercle or excrescens with heat and pain, for these parts are
wrinkled, and when the wrinkles swell there is a Condyloma, sometimes it is
without inflammation and s^^t, or with inflammation and hard. It is usual n the
privities and fundament of such as have the French pox.

They are from a sharp malignant humor, The Causes
which is always in the Pox, and sometimes they follow hard clefts or chaps.

They are pain and burning, the skin is wrinkled, The Signs.
and when they are many, they are like a bunch of Grapes

They are hard to be cured, if they are from The Pr^gnostick.
the Pox first cure that, and then they often vanish of themselves.

After general evacuations proper against the The Cure.

Take oil of Lineseed and Ros^s, ^ach an ounce; oil of Eggs half an ounce, mix

If there be no inflammation, use driers and repellers, as Vervain, Ivy,
Acacia, Pomegranate peels and slowers, for Baths and Fomentations, and after
add Discussers, as Chamomile and Thyme.

If it be old and hard, first soften it with the same, and after thrice using

Chap. 6. Of Warts in the neck of the Privities and Womb.
THey are from a gross seculent and mal^gnant humor sent to the skin, and
turned to a node.

The Signs.
They are known by their shape: the malignant are known by their hardness, and
heat, and blewness, fil^h and pain.

The Progn^s^^ck.
They are often hard to be cured, because the pox is with them, and they are in
a place to which Medicines are hard to be applied, and to continue.

The Myrmeciae are not cut off, but they leave a great ulcer, the Thymi and
Clavi grow again. Acrochordones once cut, leave no root.

After Universals, and order of diet, either use The Cure.
Medicines, or cut or burn them to discuss, then use Sage dried with Figs,
Organ, Rue burnt, dry Savin, Frankincense, with Wine and Vinegar, or To be a
skilful Physician study my S^nnertus, Platerus, Riverius, Bartholinus, and
Riolanus, of the last Editions.
Snakes skins with Figs: these also dry.

These corrode, eat and burn, as juice of wild Cowcumbers, with Salt, Milk of
Figgs, Sheeps dung, Goats gall, with Niter, Aqua fortis, Spirit of Vitriol,
Sulphur, Butter of Antimony. Take heed that you hurt not the parts adjacent,
but defend them with Bole, sealed Earth, Rosewater and Vinegar: if you put the
Corrosives into Nutshells, change them twice or thrice in a day, and wash the
part with a clensing Decoction, and then cut or burn.

Chap. 7. Of the Haemorrhoids of the Womb.
THe veins that end in the neck of the womb, often swel, like the Haemorrhoids:
it is from gross blood that comes to these veins out of the time of the terms.

Inordinate flux of terms may occasion it, when The Causes
t^^y slow out of the usual time, they grow thick, and cannot get out of the
veins, but swel them.

They are to be touched, and with a Speculum The Signs.
matricis to be seen. There is pain and bleeding without order: she is pale and
lazy.

The Cure.
Correct the blood, purge, and bleed in the arm to derive and revel, of which
in the diseases of the womb.

If pain be, abate it by sitting in a Decoction of Mallows, Althaea, Chamomil,
M^lilot flowers, Moulin, Lineseed, Foenugreek; of which also make Fomentations
and Ointments, with Butter, Populeon, and Opium if there be pain.

Take Populeon, Oil of Roses, and sweet Almonds, fresh Butter, each half an
ounce; Saffron a s^^^ple, with the yolk of an Egg, make an Ointment. Or,

Take Mu^ilage of Quinces, Althaea, ea^h half an ounce; Oil of Roses, and Hens
gre^se, each a dram; the yolk of an Eg, and Saffron half a dram, mix them in a
leaden Mortar.

If pain be gone or abated, and they bleed not, use Dryers of Bole, Earth of
Lemnos, Acacia, Ceruss, froath of Silver, Lead burnt and washed, long
Birthwort, Alum, Verdigreece.

If they swell with blood, evaporate it, or ^oment with the Decoction of
Mallows, Althaea, Pellitory, Chamomil flowers, Moulin Melilot, seeds of Line
and Foenugre^k. If they do not good, open them by Fig leaves rubbed upon them,
or by Horsleeches, of which Chap. 2.

If there be proud flesh, take it o^t, as is showed.

If they bleed gently, let Nature alone to the work, for it is good, and ^rees
from other diseases. If the flux be great, and abate the strength, open a vein
in the arm diverse times, and do as in over slowing of the terms.

Question. How do the Haemorrhoids differ from the Terms flowing or stopped?
Mercurialis says, That though a flux of terms be immod^rate, yet it has its
periods, and is without pain, and makes not the body lean, but it is contrary
in the Haemorrhoids. But this is not true, for the body is not made lean
always by the Haemorrhoids, nor do the courses keep their periods alwai^s.

Besides the pain which is almost always in the Haemorrhoids, they differ in
that the terms flow from the veins of the womb and its neck, but the
Haemorrhoids are when the blood flows too much to the veins that nourish the
privities, and there either sticks or is evacuated.

see it with a Speculum: also there is matter gentle or ^ilthy: if the ulcer go
toward the bladder, they piss hot and often: there is pain in the roots of the
eyes to the hands and fingers fainting, and a little ^ever sometimes.

Lib. 1. de morb. mulierum.
The external Causes are to be related by the patient. If it be from the pox or
Gonorrhaea, the signs of them will appear, of which Hippocrates.

The Prognostic.
They are hard to be cured, because they are in a part fit to receive humors,
soft and moist, and that has consent with many parts. Hence are diverse
Symptoms: the great, old, and foul are worst, when they corrode, and are
hollow, they are seldom cured; they that may easily have Medicines applied to
them, are easie^t cured.

The Cure.
First, stop the flux of humors to the part, if it be either from the whole
body, or any part. And amend the distemper of the womb, that it may neither
breed nor receive bad humors. If the French pox be with it, resist that first.

If there be pain, first abate that, with Milk steeled, or with three whites of
Eggs, and Mucilage of Fleabane, or an Emulsion of Poppy seeds. Or, Take Althaea
roots an ounce, Dill seed two drams, Barley a pugil, Faenugreek and Lineseed,
each an ounce; Fleabane and Poppy seed, each half an ounce; boil them in Milk.
Of which in pain of the womb.

In a foul ulcer, first use Clensers, as Whey, Barley water, Honey, Wormwood,
Smallage, Orobus, Orris, Birthwort, Mirrh, Turpentine, Alum. As, Take new Milk
boiled a pint, Honey half a pint, Orris powder half an ounce. Use it hot often
every day.

When that which was injected, is voided, wash with the decoction of Mallows,
and put up this Pessary. Take Eruum and Lentils in powder and Orris, each two
drams; with Honey. Or,

Take Diapompholigos, with Frankincense, Mastich, Mirrh, Aloes, as the ulcer
requires.

Or use Fumes. As, Take Frankincense, Mastich, Mirrh, Storax Calamite, Gum of
Juniper, Labdanum, each an ounce; make a Powder, or Troches with Turpentine.

If there be suspicion of the French pox, add a little Cinnabar. In a very foul
ulcer, and Aegyptiacum or Apostolorum, or a little Spirit of Wine. In a
creeping corroding ulcer, with clen^ers mix cold, drying and astringent
Medicines. Alum water, Plantane and Rose Water, with Pomegranate flowers
boiled, and Pomegranate peels, and Cypress-nuts is also good, and with Aloes.

After clensing, fill it with flesh, and heal it up. As, Take Tutty washed half
an ounce, Litharge, Ceruss, Sarcocol, each two drams; with Oil of Roses and Wax
make an Ointment.

Or smoke the privities with Mirrh, Frankincense, Gum or Juniper, Labdanum two
drams in powder, with Turpentine make Troches.

Or use Sulphur, or Alum Baths, and Plasters.

Inwardly give vulnerary Potions. As, Take Agrimony, Burnet, Plantane,
Knotgrass, each two pugils; China three dram^, Coriander seed half a dram,
Currants half an ounce, boil them in Henbr^ath, give it ^wice a day: or give
Turpentine and S^^ar ^^r a month, or a dram of Pills of (...).

If the body consume, give Asses milk, with (...) of Roses for a month.

Chap. 9. Of Clefts in the Neck of the Womb.
THese are long ulcers that are ^inal, like those in the hands and feet in
Winter, they eat o^ the skin, and are sometimes deep, with hard lips, if old:
sometimes they are dry, or sometimes bleed.

The Ca^ses
They come from hard travel, when some pa^ts in the neck of the womb are broken
by a great child, or violent copulation, or flux of sharp humors that stick in
the parts, and corrode.

The Signs.
If it be new, it is hidden sometimes and known in copulation, by pain and
bleeding.

The Prognostic.
The new are easier cured, then when they are old and callous.

The Cure.
If they come from hard travel, make a Clyster of the Decoction of Roses,
Plantane, Birthwort, Bole, Sanguis Draconis, Frankincense, or with the white of
an Egg, a Pessary.

If from sharp humors: after universal Evacuations, use Topics that bind
without biting, (if the clefts be not callous) as Oil of Linseed and Roses,
with the yolk of an Egg, and j^yce of Plantane mixed in a leaden Mortar. Or,

Vng. stpol ^onij apud G^l.
Take Oil of Roses eight ounces, stir it in a leaden Mortar, till it is black
and thick, then put in the pouders of Litharge of Silver and C^russ.

If they are callous, make an Ointment of oil of Lillies, Marrow of a Deer,
Turpentine and Wax: if they are malignant, cure them as ^^stula'es, of which in
the C^apter following.

If there be itch or pain. Take Diapomp^olig^^, P^pul^on, ^a^h an ounce; Sug^r

Let the diet be moist, of good juice, Chickens, Veal, Kid, rear Eggs, Mallows,
Bugloss, Borage: abstain from sharp and salt meats.

If you hope for a Cure, after Universals, giv^ drying vulnerary Drinks, of
male Fern roots, Centaury, Agrimony, Bettony, Ladies-mantle, etc.

Then use Topics; first dilate the orisice (i^ it be strait) with a Sponge or
Gentian ^oots, the^ consume the Callus, but first make it soft wi^^ Oil of
Lillies, Deer's Marrow, Tu^pentine and Wax.

Three things consume a Callus: Medicines, cutting and burning, there in a new

ounces, set it upon embers. If it be toward the womb, take heed of strong
Medicines.

If it be callous and ^oul, burn it either by a Caustic or hot iron. These are
good in the ou^ward part of the neck: then cleanse and heal.

Chap. 11. Of a Cancer in the Womb.
IT is seldom seen, and never cured: but here I shall speak of that in the neck
of the womb, which is ulcerated, or not ulcerated.

It is from terms burnt, and hot burnt humors The Causes

are more corrupt, it is ulcerated.

The Signs.
They are hard to be known at first, because it is a tumor without pain, and
after there is a pricking in it, and a pain in the groyns, loins, and bottom of
the belly. The tumor is hard, blew, with blew stinking lips When it is
ulcerated, the Sym^^^^s are all worse, and there is a thin, bla^k, s^inking

SOmetimes the whole womb is gangrenated, and it is from the privities that
receive many excrements apt to corrupt.

he Causes
It is from an inflammation and ulcer not well cured, because the part has
many excrements, which easily quench the natural heat, and then the part
mortifies.

The Signs.
There is an usual heat in the neck of the womb, and a fever with horror all
over the body, then the color changes in the part, it is black and blew,
without pulse or sense: when i^ is cut or pricked, it stinks, and the strength

THE FOURTH BOOK.
THE SECOND SECTION.
Of the Diseases of the Womb.
Chap. 1. Of the Knowledge of the Temper of the Womb.
Lib. uterus muliebris.
MARK Anthony Vlmus Physician of Bononia, shows the temper of the womb: he
says that a beard in women shows that they have a hot womb, and hot stones: it
comes with the beginning of the terms, and when the breasts swell, and is hard
to be seen.

Aristotle says, That some women have hairs in Lib. 3. de lust. any. c. 11.
their chin, when their courses stop, and when they have a hot womb and stones.

But there are more certain signs of heat. 1. When hard hair comes ^orth
suddenly, thick, black, and long, and large about; if they come forth slow,
thin, soft, yellowish, and but few not spreading the womb is cold.

Also when the ter^s come forth at twelve years of age, it is a ^ign of a hot
womb, and when they last long, the blood is red, hot, but not very much. In an
old constitution they come later, and the blood is cold and waterish, and they
end sooner. If it be hot and moist, they flow plentifully, and last till after
fifty. If it be hot and dry, the blood is yellow, thin and sharp, and pricks
the privities.

If it be cold and moist, the blood comes late forth, with difficulty, and it
is whitish and thin. If it be cold and dry, the terms come forth very late, and
with difficulty, and seldom continue till forty, and the blood is thick and
little.

The third sign is from Lechery, for they who have hot wombs desire copulation
^ooner and more vehemently, and are much delighted th^rwith. They who are cold,
do the contrary. The hot and moist are not tired with much Venery. The hot and
dry have great lust, and a Frenzy if they want it; but they are quickly ^ired,
because there are but few Spirits. If it be cold and moist, they are not soon
lecherous, and are ^asily satisfied; and if they miscarry often, the womb is
made colder, and they delight not in the sport: but copulation does them good,
and makes them more youthful. If it be cold and dry, they desire not a man in a
long time, and take no delight, because the Spirits are few.

The fourth sign is from often conception, for the hot conceive often, and
bring forth males or Viragoe's, if the seed of the man agree with it. The cold
does the contrary.

A hot and moist womb is very fruitful, if the man be well tempered, and though
he be old and weak, yet she will conceive by him: sometimes they have twins, or
over do, and have a mole.

Hot and dry are fruitful, but not so much as the former.

Cold and moist, are hard to conceive, especially when they are in years; when
they are young, and the seed of the man is hot and dry, they conceive males, but
seldom well shaped or healthful, and the woman while she is with child, is
sickly.

A cold and dry womb is commonly barren, and if they conceive, the man's seed is
hot and moist, they bring forth ^emales; and if males, they are tall, and
quickly look old.

Chap. 2. Of the hot Distemper of the Womb.
HEat of the womb is necessary for conception: but if it be too much, it
nourishes not the seed of the man, but disperseth its heat, and hinders the
conception

The Causes
This preternatural heat is from the birth sometimes, and makes them barren; if
afterward, it is from hot causes, that bring the heat and the blood to the
womb: from internal and external Medicines, too much hot meats, and drinks, and
exercise.

The Signs.
They are prone to lu^t, have few courses, yellow, or black, or burnt, or
sharp, they have hairs betimes upon their privities; they are subject to the
headache, and there are signs of much choler, their lips are dry.

When this distemper is strong, they have few The Pr^gnostick.
terms, and out of order; they are ^ad and hard to flow, and in time they are
H^p^^^ondria^ks, and for the most part barren; and ^here is sometimes a Frenzy
of the womb.

Use Coolers: so that they offend not the vessels, The Cure.
that must be open for the flux of the terms. Therefore,

Use inwardly Succory, Endive, Violets, Waterlillies, Sorrel, Lettice, Sanders,
and Syrups, and Conserves made thereof. As,

Take Conserve of Succory, Violets, Waterlillies, Borage, each an ounce;
Conserve of Roses half an ounce, Diamargariton frigid, Diatrionsantalon, each
half a dram; with Syrup of Viole^s or juice of Citrons, make an Electuary.

Outwardly use Ointment of Galens Cooler, Ointment of Roses^ Cerot of Sanders,
Oil of Roses, Violets, Waterlillies, Gourds, Venus navel to the back and loins;
or make Cataplas^s of Barley meal, Roses poudered, Violets, Waterlillies,
Sanders, with juice or water of Plantane, Waterlillies, Succory Lettice, Oil of
Roses, Violets, Waterlillies.

Baths are good to sit in, and cooling ^omentations, and after let her take
some of the Coolers mentioned. In great heat, use this cooling Pessary.

Take Opium a s^ruple, Goose grease two scruples, Eros. de p^ss. mulie. c. 7.
Wax and Honey, each four scruples; Oil an ounce, whites of two Eggs.

This was from an opinion the Ancients had, that Opium was cold, but take heed
of the using it too much, least the narcoti^k quality hurt.

Let the air be cool, her garments thin: let her meat be with Lettice, Endive,
Succory, Barley: give no hot mea^s nor strong Wine, except it be wat^^ish and
thi^; rest is good both in body and mind: she m^st not co^ulate, but she may
sleep much.

Chap. 3. Of the cold Distemper of the Womb.
THis causes many evils, and barrenness.

They are contrary to those of a hot distemper; The Causes
cold air, rest and idleness and cooling Medicines^

The Signs.
It is known by their not desire of le^hery, no^ receiving pleasure in the time
of copula^ion, when they spend their ^eed. The ter^s are fle^matick, think and
^^im^, and flow not righ^ly^ there is wind in the womb the seed is crude,
waterish^ with a Gonor^haea.

The Prognos^ick.
It is the cause of obstructions and barrenness, and is hard to be cured.

The Cure.
Use things proper to heal the womb, as this W^te^.

T^ke Galanga^, Ci^namon^ Nutmeg, Mace, Cloves each tw^ (...) Ging^r, Cubeb^,
Zedoary, ^ardamo^s, e^ch ^n ounce; grains of Paradise, long P^pper, each half
an ounce; beat them, and put them i^ six qu^rt^ of ^ine for ei^ht days, then
add Sa^e, Min^s, Balm, Motherw^rt, eac^ three handf^ls; let them stand ^ight
days more, then pour ^ff the ^ine, and bent the herbs and the Spi^es, and th^n
pour on the Wine^ and distill them.

Another. Take Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Cl^v^s, Mace, Ginger^ Cubeb^, Cardamoms^
grains of P^radise, ^ach an oun^e and hal^: Gal^n^al six drams, long ^epper
ha^f an oun^e, Zedoary five drams, bruise them, and add six quarts of Wine, put
them in a Cellar nine dai^s, daily stirring them; then add Mints two h^nd^uls,
then let them stand fourteen days, pour off the Wine, and bruis^ them, and
then pour on the Wine again^ and distill them.

Querce^an has an H^sterick Ex^ract, a ^reater In phar. doc. restit. cap. 25.
and a less; use outwardly Fomentations, Baths^ Baggs, of hot Roots, as
Birthwort, Lovage Vale^ian, Angelica, Burnet, M^sterwort, Calamus, M^dder,
Elicampane, Or^is, and Herbs, as Mugwort, Balm, Motherwort, Savin, Pennyroyal,
Calamints, Organ, Dittany, Ma^joram, Rue, Bettony, Rosemary, L^vender, Sage,

half an oun^^; Oil of Cloves, Nu^megs, each hal^ a scruple; O^l of Lillies,
Rue, ^ach an ounce; with Wax make a Plaster.

A F^me. Take Fr^nkincense, Mirrh, Mastich, ^ach a dram; Bayberries a dram and
half, Labda^um two drams^ S^^rax, Cloves^ eac^ a dram; Gum Ar^bick and Wine
make Troches, or Pessaries of ^he same.

Let the diet be warming, and the air, the meat ^f easy conco^tion, seasoned
with Anise, Fen^el, Thyme. Avoid Milk-meats, and raw fruits.

Chap. 4. Of the moist Distemper of the Womb.
THis is ^ommo^ly jo^ned with a co^d distemper, and causes b^rrenness, and
(...) the same causes, as a cold distemper: for commonly cold things do
moisten. It is commonly in women that are idle.

The Signs
They that have moist wombs, abound in courses, but they are waterish and thin,
the privities are wet, they have the Whites, and desire not copulation much,
and delight not in it, they ret^in not the seed; and if they conceive when the
child is big, they aborte or miscarry.

The Prognostic.
If it last long, it is hard to be cured: if it be much, they conceive not.

The Cure.
It is by Dryers, and things that cure the cold distemper are good against the
moist: because all Healers have a drying power. Use sulphur Baths and in
Injections: beware of ast^ingents, least the evil humors be stop^, and the
disease i^creased.

Chap. 5. Of the dry Distemper of the Womb.
IN this the womb is hardened, of it self it is fleshy and soft, and moistened
by blood for conception.

The Causes
It is sometimes from the birth, or old age, when they are past childbearing: if
it be from dr^ing causes, they are barren before they are old.

Diseases and Medicines dry the womb, as inflammations, fevers, and when blood
flows no^ to it, nor goes to the bottom of it, by reason (...) the straitness
of the veins, or obstructions, as i^ Viragoe's, and such as never conceived:
and i^ they void any blood, it is from the neck of the womb, and not from the
bottom.

The Signs.
They void little ^eed, and are ^low in Venery^ the terms are few the mouth of
the womb is dry, and they are slender of a dry constitution, their lower lip is

This dis^emper is hard to be cured in any part, The Prognos^ick.
especially if it be old.

Use moistners as Borage, Bugloss, Mercury, The Cure.
Mallows, Althaea, Violets, sweet Almonds, Pist^chaes, Pine nuts, Jujubes,
Dates, Figs, Raisons.

Of which are made Syrups, Conserves, Emulsions, Candies etc.

Outward Remedies are made of the same, adding Time, Faenugreek seeds, Lillies,
Branckurlin, Pellitory, etc.

Fomentations are made with Milk, and after bathing anoint the region of the
womb and the belly to the privities with oil of sweet Almonds, Lilli^s,
Lineseed, Jesamin, fresh Butter, Hens and Goose grease.

Let the Diet be moistning, the Air moist, the Me^t fatning, of much
nourishment and small exc^ement, let sleep be a little longer then usual; great
labor, anger, sadness, fasting, do hurt.

Chap. 6. Of compound distempers, and first of cold and moist.
THere is seldom a simple distemper in the p^rt, and commonly there is matter
which ^eeds it^ it is usually cold and moist, which ga^he^s exc^ements of that
sort, either in the whol^ ^^dy, or in the womb after the terms.

The Causes
Are all things that breed cold and phlegmatic humors in the whole body or the
womb.

The Signs.
They conceive not, and are of an ill habit of body, the terms seldom flow
right, and they have sometimes the whites.

The Prognostic.
It is harder to cu^e then a simple distemper.

The Cure.
The cold humor is in fault, therefore prepare it with syrup of Mugwort, Mints,
Bettony, Hysop, with a decoction proper.

As, Take Fennel roots an ounce, Valerian, Elicampane, Masterwort, each half an
ounce; Pennyroyal, Mugwort, Motherwort, Nep, Marjoram, each a handful; Rosemary
and Sage flowers, each two pugils; Siler Montane, Fennel Aniseed, Parsnep seed,
each a dram; boil them: to ten ounces strained, add Sugar, syrup of Mugwort two
or three ounces, Cinnamon water half an ounce, make a potion for three doses.

Then purge it with Agarick, Mechoacan, Turbith, and if other humots be mixed
with phlegm, add Senna and the like, or use Pills de tribus Aloephanginae,
Mastich, of Hiera with Agarick, Sine quibus. Or, Take Agarick a dram and half,
Senna two drams, infuse them in Mugwort water, to three ounces strained, add
Diaphaenicon or Diacarthaemum tw^ drams, strain and add syrup of Mugwort half
an ounce, Cinnamon water half a dram.

After universal evacuations, use Pessaries. As, Take Mercury, bruise it and
put it in a bag of white Silk, anoint it with Butter or Honey of Roses.

Or, Take Benedicta laxativa three drams, Agarick two drams, Gi^h seed a dram,
Pease meal six drams, with juice of Mercury make Pessaries in a Sarsnet Bag.
Or, Take Hiera a dram, Agarick ^alf a dram, ^dellium a dram, with Honey make a
Pessary, or make it with powder of Agarick^ and Troches of Coloquintida, or
give sweats of Cuaja^um, China and Sarsa, As,

Take Guajacum a pound and eighteen ounces, in^a^e them in twelve pints of
water twenty four hours, ^hen boil them to the consumption of the third part,
^ive six or eight ounces ^ot in the morning, and le^ ^er sweat.

Pour water to the relics and boil them to ^he consumption of the third part
for an ordina^y drink.

You may use China and Sarsa the same way, and because in a decoction some
strength is lost, and so great a quantity is tedious for wom^n, ^ou may distill
them and give a less quantity ^ith things proper for the womb.

As, Take Guajacum a pound, or Sarsa eight ^unces, Angelica, Elicampane, each
an ounce; ^ugwort two handfuls, Di^tany half a handful, ad ^x pints of water or
wine, steep them two days, then ^istill them, and give two ounces of the water.

Let her meat be roasted birds, hens, capons, ^artridges, mutton, sweet
Almonds, Raisons, ^t her abstain from ^alt and sharp things.

If these sweats are unpleasant, give them in ^e third and fourth Chapter
internal and exter^al. As, Take conserve of Marjoram, Rosemary, ^ettony, each
two ounces; of Balm an ounce, Dia^oschu dulcis, Diam^rgarion calid, each a
dram; ^ndied Eryngus and Citrons, each half an ounce; ^ith s^rup of Mugwort
make an El^ctuary, and use ^aths to (...) in mentioned.

Drying Spaw-waters are good to drink, or to (...) in.

Let the diet be as in Chap. 3. and 4. give the flesh of wild Mountain ^owl,
Pigeons, Hens, Capons, Mutton, roasted and spiced and old wine, and let her
exercise.

Of the hot and dry distemper of the womb with Choler.
Do as in Chap. 5. purge the Choler, whethe^ it be from the whole body, or from
the Liver, with syrup of Roses, Manna, Tamarinds, Rhubarb, Senna, etc.

Chap. 7. Of the ill shape of the womb, and first of the straitness of it and
its vessels.
THis is a disease of evil conformation from nature, when it can be stretched
out no further, this makes an abortion in the fourth or fifth month.

But it is wonderful in its natural shape when it will stretch according to the
proportion of the child, and after childbearing be as small as a^ first.

Of straitness of the vessels of the Womb.
This is usual, and hinders the flux of the terms and conception, it is in the
vessels of the womb, and of the neck thereof.

The Causes
Are thick tough humors that stop the mouth^ of the veins and arteries, these
are bred of gro^^ or much nourishment, when the heat of the womb is so weak
that it cannot attenuate the humors, these either ^low from the whole body o^
are gathered in the womb.

Sometimes vessels are closed by inflammatio^ or S^irrhus, o^ other tumor. 3.
They are stopped by astringen^ Medicines. 4. By compression. 5. From a Scar or

hi^ders conception: and this stoppage is known by crudities abounding in the
body, which are known by their signs. Sometimes thick phlegm comes from the
womb, if there was a wound before, or the Secundine was pulled out by force.

humors, is hard to be cured; if it be from disorderly use of astringents, it
is more curable: if it be from a Scirrhus or other tumor that compresseth or
closes the vessels, that cannot be cured, the disease is incurable.

Obstructions are taken away by the means The Cure.
mentioned in the cold and moist Distemper of the Womb: ^le^m must be purged
and she must be let blood, as in stoppage of the terms.

After Universals; come to the obstruction with Medicines that move the terms:
these take away the cause, as in the Chapter of the cold distemper of the Womb.
Or,

Take Asparagus roots, Parsley roots, each an ounce; Madder roots half an
ounce, red Pease half a handful, Pennyroyal, Calamints, each a handful;
Wall-flowers, Dill flowers, each two pugils; boil, strain and add syrup of
Mugwort an ounce and half.

Or, Take Birthwort and white Dittany roots, ^ach ^n ounce; Cos^us, Cinnamon,
Galangal, each half ^n ounce; Rosemary, P^nnyroyal, Calamints, B^t^ony ^^^wers,
each a handful; Anise and Fennel^e^^, each a dram; Saffron half a dram, with
^i^e.

O^ use Topi^ks, as, Take Mugwort, Mar^oram, Calamints, Mercury, Pennyroyal,
each tw^ hand^uls; S^ge, R^semary, Bays, ^hamomil flowers, ea^h a hand^^l; boil
them in water, fomen^ the groyns and the bottom of the belly: or let her ^it in
a Bath up to the navel; and then anoint about the groyns, with Oil of Rue
Lillies, Dill, etc.

Or use Pessaries and Fumes mentioned.

If straitness be from other diseases, cure them first.

Chap. 8. Of the opening of the Vessels of the Womb besides Nature.
THis is when there is great bleeding.

The Causes
The vessels are opened preternaturally three ways, by Anastomosis, Diaeresis,
and by Diapedesis, as in the lungs. Anastomosis is from much blood which the
liver does produce, and send out by the womb, as in some by the nose.

For the blood being thin, hot, choleric and sharp, opens the mouths of the
vessels, and causes a flux.

Diaeresis is from much blood, when there is great motion, as when there is
long copulation with a strong man that has a great tool, or a hard travel, or
abortion, a ^all or stroke; also when sharp humors corrode, or sharp pessaries.

Diaped^sis is from the thinness of the vessels, and looseness, and the thinness
of the blood, or from much moisture, or use of Baths.

The Signs.
Much blood is a ^ign the vessels are open, you shall know the causes that open
them thus. In Anastomosis the blood drops, and is th^n, and there are signs of
much blood, or sharp and thin.

If there be a Di^er^sis, the blood flows more, and there are clodde^s and
there were causes that broke the vessels, as sharp Suppositories.

Diapedesis is known, when the woman is of a thin and loose habit of body, the
blood thin, or she has used ^uch bathing.

If the vessels open from much blood in a sound The Pr^gnostick.
body, there is less danger, and it is easier cured then in a Caco^hymy.

In an A^asiomosis give things that thicken The Cure.
without slime, as Roses, Mirtles, Medlars, Services, Pomegranate peels and
fl^wers, Sanders, ^oral, Hearts horn, Cypress-nu^s.

In Diaeresis give things that thicken with slime' as Comfrey, Plantane, Gum
Traganth, whites of Eggs, Troches of Amber, Bole, Starch, Rice Quinces, Sanguis
Draconis, Sarcocol, and Izing glass.

But because there are diverse causes, and these dise^es are not cured but by
taking them away ^ we shall speak of them in the Chapter of immoderate Terms.

Chap. 9. Of a double Womb, the wanting of a Womb, and evil shape of the Womb,
and strange things found in it.
Julius Obsequens sai^s that one woman had two w^mbs, and (...) says that a
Maid had her womb in two parts, as in Bitches.

C^l^mbus says that one wanted a womb, but Lib. 15. a^^^o.
^e^ privities were as in other women, and part ^f the neck of it hung out.

Worms in the Womb.
Lib. de morb. mul.
Hippocrates writes that worms are found in the womb. And Gynaecea writes, it
is a sign tha^ Nature is wanton, etc. And John de Tornamira writes, that he saw
a Woman that had an intolerable itching in her womb from the Ascarides, he
gave a Womb clyster of the Decoction of Wormwood and Hiera, and she voided many
small worms, and was cured.

An Addition.
* Wheresoever foul humors stop in any part, it is no wonder if it breed worms,
if other things agree which are required for the breeding of them.

Fat and hair found in a Womb.
Cent. obser. 5. obser. 49.
William Fabricius mentions that in a dead woman the womb was taken out, and it
weighed eighty seven pounds, and was full of diverse humors; in the middle there
were hairs like yellow wool.

An Addition.
* This was by Magic, or a humor lay there fit to breed this strange matter,
by preternatural heat.

Stones bred in the Womb.
Lib. 4. de morb. m^lier. ^. 11.
Mercurialis doubts of stones being bred in it^ but thinks it is clotted blood
like stones.

But it cannot be denied which many worthy Lib. 5. ^pid.
Authors write. First Hipp^cra^es w^it^s that a Woman of sixty, after noon
alwa^es was pain^d as one in travel, after she had eaten many leeks, she had
one ^it worse then the rest, and she arose, and found something rough in the
orifice of her womb, and she fainted, and another woman t^^^st in her hand, and
took out a great stone, and the woman recovered.

E^ius also says, Hard stones are bred in the Tetrab. 4. ser. 4. c. 98.
womb s^mtimes, etc.

Ni^olas Flore^tine and Mar^^l^us Donatus say the same.

Chap. 10. Of the magnitude of the Womb increased, and first of the inflation
of the Womb.
IN^lation is a stretching of the womb with wind, it called by some a windy
Mole. See Ma^h. de grad. in 9. Rhasis.
Matthew de gradibus: And Thadeus Dun lib. mis^el. c. 8.

This wind is from a cold matter, either thick The Causes
or thin, contained in the veins of the womb, which overcom^s the weak heat of
the womb; it is gather^d there by cold meats and drinks, or flows from other
parts. Cold air may be the cause also, if women that lie in, expose themselves
to it. This wind is contained either in the cavity of the vessels of the womb,
or between the tunicl^^.

There is a swelling in the region of the womb, The Signs.
sometimes reaching to the navel, loins and Diaphragma; and as wind increases
or decreaseth, it a^iseth or abateth, it is different from a Dropsy, because
it is never ^^ollen so high.

And least a Phy^itian be deceived, and take it for a conception, observe the
signs of women with child, for if one sign be wanting, you may suspect an
in^lation; also in in^lation the tumor in^reaseth and decreaseth, but in
conception it still increases. Moreover if you strike upon (...) belly, there
is a noise, but not in conception.

Bleed not, because it is from a cold matter: i^ it come after childbearing,
and the terms were not sufficient after, and there is fullness of blood, open

After these, give things mentioned in Tympany, that respect the womb. As, Take

Use Sulphur-baths and Spaw-waters inward and outward, for they expel wind.

If it come from cold after childbearing, and she is not well purged by her
terms, heat the womb, and purge, and give strong wine

Let the diet be hot, cutting and attenuating, The Diet.
with things that expel wind, and little at a time.

Question^ Whether the wind is in the cavity^ when there is in^^ation of the
Womb?
It is so by experience, though some deny it, nor is there any cause why wind
should not b^ bred in the womb, as well as in any other part; both by reason of
the excrements that come thither, and the natural heat that turns them into
wind: these also stretch the womb (though it be thick) as in dropsies and
conception; also the retentive and altering faculty of the womb is never idl^,
so that when it receives diseased and un^ruitful ^eed, it suffers it not to
corrupt, but turns Lib. de n^^. pueri.
it into wind. As Hippocrates writes, When the w^^b is stre^^hed by wind from
the belly, women think they have conceived.

Chap. 11. Of the Dropsy of the Womb.
THey are also deceived, and think they are with child: when there is water
that swel^ the womb; this is a D^opsie of the womb. This Ves. lib. 6. de corp.
hum. Fab. Mar. Do. de hist. me. mira. l. 4. c. 21.
water is either in the cavity o^ between the co^ts of the womb, o^ in its
vessels. ^^salius, Marcellus Donatus show that water is in the cavity, for it
does not pre^ently by its plenty or quality, force its passage out, because the
ori^ice is not always open, and Nature gathers it by degrees, and is used to
it.

Tetra. 6. 4. ser. 4 c^p. 79.
A^tius ^aies, There are sometimes bladders of water in the womb. And
Christopher Vega ^aith, that Leonora thought that she had gone six months, and
then voided sixty bladders of water, and seven pieces of ^lesh, like that of
the s^leen in membranes.

Lib. 4. obser. ^ent. ^. ob^^r. 5^.
There is sometimes a Dropsy of the womb wi^h conception, as Schenki^s and
William Fabri^ius ^aith of his own Wi^e.

The (...)
A^e gathering of water from moistness mixed with the t^rm^, and from an evil
sang^ifi^ation in the liver and ^^leen, from ^h^ir weakness, o^ from errors in
diet; or from weakness of the womb, from hard travel, or often mischances, cold
air or water, or whatsoever hurts the hea^ of the womb.

Also stoppage of the terms does cause gathering of water, for the water uses
to be evacuated with them. Many take this for the only cause.

Sometimes the tunicles of the womb may be divided in some place, and water may
be gathered between them.

Hippocrates says, The terms are ^ewer, and The Signs. 1. De morb. mulier.
cease before the time; the bottom of the belly swells, and the papps are so^t
without milk, and she thinks she is with child: by these you may know it is a
Dropsy.

But because Doctors and Midwives are often deceived, you must distinguish this
from other swellings.

When a woman is sound, and uses a sound man, the womb by degrees swells, and
the child moves in its time, but often there is a Dropsi^ with conception
before or after; therefore in a Dropsy the tumor is equal, according to the
largeness of the womb and ^elly, and no^ pointed as in a woman with child.

Secondly, i^ the woman be in years, and has not conceived before, and has a
good color, it is a sign of a Dropsy rather then conception. If the tenth
month be past, and the child moves not, nor the breasts swell, but are soft,
say there is a D^opsie of the womb. Thirdly, in a true conception, women are
b^tter after some months, and the Symptoms abate, but in a Dropsy they
increase still.

It is distinguished from a mole by the weight in the bottom of the belly.

From an inflation^ because the belly is st^etched in that, and sounds being
stricken, but is so^t in a Dropsy.

It differs from the Dropsy of the belly, because the face is pale or wane, in
that from the distemper of the liver there is thirst, but in the won b^dropsie
she is of a good color, except the liver be also bad.

It differs from inflammation of the womb, for that is ^ith a constant fever,
and the Symptoms o^ it, and from other tumors which are harder, but in a
D^opsie of the womb, if the belly be pre^^ed^ it yi^ld^.

You shall know whether it be from the fault in the wo^b ^rincipally, or ^^om
some other part, thus. I^ the woman be of a good color, and there were only
some diseases and causes that might hurt the womb^ as abortion, hard travel,
stoppage of terms, or too many of them, then the womb is chiefly affected; but
if there be signs of a distem^er in the whole body, or in the liver or spleen,
and the color is bad, it is by consent from other parts.

You shall kn^w whether the water be in bladde^s or in the cavity of the womb,
thus: If you find the ori^ice o^ the womb closed, and there is little pain, it
is in the cavity, but if the ori^ice be open, and there is great pain, it is in
bladders or without the cav^^y.

The (...).
If the humor in the womb be not corrupt, this disease is of long continuance,
but may be easily cured: it is ea^ier cured in the cavity, then when it is in
bladders, and between the ^unicles. A woman after conception having a Dropsy
of the womb, her child di^th, and she is in danger.

The Cu^^.
When it is from st^ppage of terms, and new, and the st^ength ^irm, open a vein
in the legs, otherwise bleed not.

Purge according to the humor, with respect to the womb, as in Chap. 6. of a
cold Distemper.

Then purge Water. Take Angelica and Madder roots, each half ^n ounce;
Calamints^ Pennyroyal, Mugwort, Lovage, e^ch a handful; Savin a pugil, boil
them in wine, sweeten it with Sugar Or make Broaths with the same. Take
Dianisum, Diagalangal, each half a dram; Oil of Aniseeds, Cloves, each five
drops; Sugar three ounces, make Rouls.

Inject into the Womb as in Dropsies. Take Asarum roots t^ree drams,
Pennyroyal, Calamints, ea^h hal^ a handful; Savin a pugil, Mechoacan a d^am,
Aniseed, Cummin, each half a dram; boil, ta^e six ounces strained, Oil of Elder
and Orris, each an ounce; make a Clyster. Or use Pe^^aries. Take Agarick a
dram, Coloquintida half a dram, Gni^ium ten grains, with Honey and Wool, make a
Pe^^ary.

Make Fomentations and Baths of Danewort, Me cury, Elder, Pennyroyal, Organ,
Chamomilflowers, Ba^berries, wild Cowcumbers, Broom, Carrot, Rue seeds. And
anoint after with Oil of Elder, Danewort, Orris, with drops of Oil of Ang^lica,
Anise, Caraway.

S^lphur Baths are good, and those of Niter, o^ the Plaster of Bayberries, or
Snails to the bott^m of the belly. Vomiting and neesing break the bladders.
Give Clysters at the fundament as in Dropsies. Take Mercury leaves, Danewort,
Soldanella, Mugwort^ Motherwort, each a handful; Chamomil, Elder, Broom
flow^rs, each a dram; boil and to ten ounces strained, add juice of Beets,
Mercury, Danewort, ea h six drams; Boys urine an ounce and half, Hiera six
drams, Honey half an ounce, make a Clyster.

Let the Diet be drying, as in Chap. 5.

Chap. 12. Of a Tumor in the Womb, from blood in its Veins.
THis disease makes Women think they are with child also: for blood long
detained in the v^ins about the womb, stretches them outwardly, and twisteth
them, and the veins in the substance of the womb are full and stretched, and
make it larger; but when the terms flow, it falls again, except there be a
Cachexy or Dropsy.

This is only from stoppage of terms, and is cured by provoking them.

Chap. 13. Of Inflammation of the Womb.
IF the blood that comes to the womb, get out of the vessels into its
substance, and grow hot and putresie, it causes inflammation, either all over,
or in part, before or behind, above or below, on the right or left side.

The Causes
Blood is the immediate Cause, which is pure or mixed; therefore the
inflammation is either an Erysipelas, Oedema or Scirrhus, as phlegm, melancholy,
or blood abound. Blood is either sent to, or drawn by the womb; by heat or
pain^ it is sent to it, when it abounds, or is hot or thin, and when the
blood is moved by hot air, exercise, passions, as anger or hot diet.

The Signs.
There is a tumor with heat and pain in the r^gion of the womb, with stretching
and heaviness in the privities, and if you put in your ^inger, you will feel the
heat, and the more pain; there is a fever sometimes called Lipyria, when there
is cold without, and heat within. The tongue is dry and bl^ck, with watching,
doting, to^^ing to and fro, the breasts are pufft up and pained. There is
headache to the roots of the eyes, and a pain in the groyns, hips, midrif,
pleura and shoulders: short wind, and like a Pleurisy, with loathing,
vomitin^, hickets. The belly is bound, the pulse is small, and often and weak,
but at first darting and quick. And Hippocrates ^aith, If the womb 2. De more.

with many small vein^, etc.

I^ it be inflamed before, the pain is about the ^^bes, and the urin is stopped.
If behind it is in the ^oyns, and the belly is bound. If it be inflamed in the
bottom, the pain is toward the navel. If it be from pure blood, the Symptoms
are less, if from choler stronger, the thi^st is more, the watching greater: if
from melancholy, all are worse.

If it be all over the womb, it is dangerous, and The Prognostic.
few escape it. An Erysipelas in a woman with child is deadly, because there is
an abortion, and the Mother dies: the worse the Symptoms, the greater is the
danger. And it is safer to discuss an inflammation then to ripen it: if it turn
to a Schirrus, it is lasting, and makes (...) Dropsy.

If it be not after abortion or a flux of blood, open a vein in the Arm, or cup

^aith, You may divert the blood by bleeding in the arm, or cupping the
breasts, and you man derive it by ^pening the ankle-vein, and cupping upon t e
hips.

If there be choler^ purge it with Syrup of Roses, Manna, Rhubarb,
Diacatholicon; and use not strong movers of the terms.

Use Alte^ers and Coolers, as Juleps and Emulsions, and provoke sleep, and if
there be dotage, give Narcoticks.

After Univ^rsals use Repellers and A^odynes. As, Take Housleek, Purslane,
Letti^^, Venus-navel^ Vine leaves, each half a handful; boil them in wine, add
Barley meal two ounces, Pomegrana^e fiowers two drams, Bole a dram, with Oil of
Roses, ^ake a Pultis. Or, Take Diachylon simple tw^ ^unces, j^yce of
Venus-navel and Plantane, each ha^f an ounce; Oil of Roses an ounce, Sugar of
Lead a dram, make an Ointment in a leaden Mortar.

Make Injections of the same Herbs, or of Milk and Rosewater. Or, Take
Plantane, Ven^^-na^el, Lettice, each a han^ful; re^ R^ses two p^^il^, boil, and
ad Oil of Mirtles an ounce, Ros^-vinegar half an ounce make an In^^ction.

Make Clysters of the some Plants in a small quantity, least they oppress the
wo^b.

T^ke Al^haea roots an ounce, M^llows, Violets, Lettice, each a handful;
Nightshade half a handful, Violets, Roses, each a pugil; sweet Pr^nes ten,
Linseed half a dram, boil them in Barley wat^r, to six ounces, ad Oil of Roses
three ounces, make a Clys^er.

An anodyne Fomentation. Take roots of Althaea, Mallows and Vi^lets, each a
handful; red Roses, Melilot, C^amomil flowers, each a pugil; boil them for a
Fomentation.

Or use a Cataplasm of white Bread and Milk.

I^ the progress dis^uss. As, Take powder of Alth^ea roots an ounce, Chamomil
and Meli^ot ^^owers, e^^h two drams; Mugw^rt half an ounce, Barley and Bean
flour, ^ach an ounce; boil them in sharp wine, add Hogs grease, Oil of Chamomil
and Lilli^^, ^^ch an ^unce; make a Ca^aplasm.

If the inflammation turn to matter, ripen it. As, Take po^der of Altha a
r^ots, Chamomil flo^^rs, M^lil^t^ Lineseed, Fae^ugreek^ each an ounce; Figgs
eight, boil them, add yolk^ of ^our Eggs, and ha^^ a scruple of Sa^^ron, make a

A^^er it is ripe, break it by motion of the body, coughing, ne^sing, cupping,
or by Pe^^aries. As, Take ^iggs an ^unce, Rue half a hand^ul, boil them (...)
ad Honey and Leaven, each half an ounce; Pigeons dung, Orris roots, each half a
dram; with wool make a Pessary.

After it is broken, the pain abates, th^n cle^se and heal the ulcer as in
Sect. 1. c. 8. of an ulcer of the womb. If it break about the bladder give an
Emulsion of cold Seeds, Whey, and Syrup of Violets.

de^lination of the disease, let the belly still (...) kept loo^e.

Chap. 14. Of a Scirrhus and Cancer in the Womb.
AN earthy matter left after an inflammation mak^s a hard tumo^ called a
Scirrhus, and s^mtimes it is without an inflammation It is a p^oper S^irrhus
when there is neither sense nor p^n; it is imp^oper when there is a little
sense. It is so^times as big as a man's head; sometimes Pa^^^us l. 23. c. 36.
the whole womb is a S^inhus, s^mtimes only p^rt of it.

The immediate Cause, is a think earth^ hu^or, The Cause^
as n^tural melan^^oly^ when a think humor is gathered in the womb, there is a
Scirrhus without inflammation aforegoing; this i^ usual in melancholy women,
and such as are no^ cleansed by their terms, or have the Pica or greensickness,
and are fifty years old.

Other humors sometimes breed a Scirrhus afte^ inflammation, when cold
astringents have been used disorderly, for then the humor is fixed to the part
and hardened. The same may be from hot discussers, which send forth the thin
matter in an inflammation, and fasten the thick.

The Signs.
The tumor is to be felt, it yields not, and is without pain, the terms flow
not at first, or very little, and afterward there is a great flux of blood. If
an inflammation went before, and the part is heavy and burdened, it is a sign of
a Scirrhus. She is unweeldy, ^loathful; and you may know from what humor, it is
by the signs of the humors predominating in the body, and the part pained will
show you in what place it is.

The Prognostic.
A Scirrhus easily turns to a Cancer. And when the terms are stopped, there is a
Dropsy of the womb or belly. It is easier cured in the neck then in the womb
it self.

The Cure.
Moisten and heat the cold and dry humor, with Borage, Bugloss, Fumitory,
Succory, Epithymum, Polypod^. Then purge with Polypody, Senna, black Hellebore,
and the like. As, Take roots of Althaea, Lilli^s, e^ch two ounces; Mallows,
Vi^l^t^, Al^haea, Brankursine, each a hand^ul; Mug^ort, Calamints, Chamomil
flowers, each half a handful; ^ae^^greek and Lin^e^d, each half an ^unce; b^^l
them ^or a Fomentati^n, or Bath, or to a Catap^asm, with Linesee^, Faenugreek,
^a h an ^unc^; Fi^s six, Orris p^uder ^wo drams, Sa^^ron half a dram, Hen^
grease and Oil of sweet A^monds as much as is ^it.

Or, Take Bdellium, Ammoniacum, Galbanum, each as much as you please, beat them
in a Mortar, with Oil de Been and Lillies, add Mucilage of Faenugreek,
Lineseed, Figgs, make a Liniment, or with wax a Plaster.

Or, Take Oil of Capars, Lillies, sweet Almonds, Jesamine, each an ounce; fresh
Butter, Hens grease, Goose grease, each half an ounce; Mucilage of Faenugreek,
Althaea and Ointment of Althaea, ea^h six drams; Ammoniacum dissolved in wine
an ounce, with wax make an Ointment.

Make Injections thus. Take Bdellium dissolved in wine, Oil of sweet Almonds,
Lillies, Chamomil, each two ounces; marrow of a Veal bone, Hens grease, each an
ounce; with the yolk of an Eg.

In a bastard Scirrhus, you may use healers and digesters better, and
Ammoniacum, and hotter Fats.

Internal Medicines, are steel etc. of which in obstruction of the Womb, and
Scirrhus of the Spleen.

As for diet, abstain from breeders of gross and slimy humors, and from hot
dryers.

Cancer of the Womb.
What may be said of this, is said before, only a Cancer may seize upon the
substance of the womb, but it is more usually in the neck of it.

Chap. 15. Of the displacing of the Womb; and first of the Ascent of it.
WHen the womb falls out of the privities, it is called Procidentia uteri: this
is ordinary, Eustach. rud. lib. 2. pract. c. 5.
but the asce^t or going up of the womb is more unknown. Many grave Anatomists
hold tha^ the womb does ascend, if sweet things are applied to the nose; if to
the privities, that it descend^ if stinking s^ents come, the womb flies from
th^^ and it is to be seen by breathing altered, and by some meats that the womb
greedily desires, and catches up.

Galen overthrows this opinion, and says that 6. De lo. aff. c. 5.
the womb does move after a sort, and ascend, but it is very little, and not to
be demonstrated; nor can it arise to the stomach, it is tied with such strong
ligaments to its place; and when it falls out the ligaments are extended by
moisture, and falling of it down. And there is no reason why the ligaments
though loose or wet, it should go up so speedily, and come down again; for^
falling down is by degrees, and it is not soon brought up again. And though it
be enlarged in conception, it is by degrees and equally, not suddenly in one
side. Nor are the ligaments made very loose in conception, and the bottom of
the womb is not tied, the ligaments being only on the sides.

But this cannot be denied, which women affirm, that they feel a body or ball
moving about the navel, and a Physician or Midwife may feel it. Therefore let
us enquire what it is, if it be not a womb. That body which you may feel stir,
is the stones, and that blind vessel which Fallopius found out, which he
compared to the great end of a Trumpet, called F^llopius his Trumpet. For the
stones hang, and the body of the T^umpet is l^ke a pipe loose and moving, and
when they are full and swell with corrupt seed and vapo^s, they move to and
fro, and ascend as high as the navel. And the stones with the Trumpet make this
round tumor of the womb, which is Antrop^g^. lib. ^. c. 34.
felt in women, as Riolanus observes.

Whatsoeve^ makes corrupt seed in the stones The Causes
of a woman, and fills them ^th evil ^apors or wind, is the cause of which in
suffocation of the womb; for the cause is alike in both, only in suffocation
the Symptoms are worse^ because the evil vapors are then more freely carried by
the veins arteries and nerves, and asilict the principal parts.

The woman and others may feel a round body, The Signs^
and she ^indeth a pain at her heart, and short breath, without sleeping or
doting, or other symptoms, and there we^e causes that disturbed the womb.

it may turn to the strangling of the womb, when these evil vapors move to the
noble parts.

Let the aim be at the corrupt seed, and vapors The Cure.
which must be dis ussed and evacuated, as in suffocation of the Womb.

Chap. 16. Of falling out of the Womb.
Sometimes it falls to the middle of the thighs, o^ to the kne^s almost, or
hangs a little out.

The womb changes its place, when the The Causes
^igaments by which it is bound to the other parts ^re not in order. There are
four, two above ^road and membranous that come from the Pe^iton^^um. and two
^elow that are nervous, ^ound and hollow. ^^^ide^, it is bound to the ^reat
ves^els by veins and a^t^ri^s, and to the ^ack by nerves.

Now the place is changed when it is down another way, or when the ligaments
are loose, and it falls down by its own weight, it is draw^ on side, when the
terms are stopped, and the vein^ and arteries ^re full, those namely which go to
the womb: if it be a mole on the one side, the liver or spleen ca^se it, by the
liv^^ veins on the rig^t side, or the spleen on the left, as they are (...)
more or less.

I also falls down by the loosning of the par^^ to which it is fastened, but how
that can be, it is not clear.

1. 2. De morb. m^lier.
Hippocrates says, It comes from external caus^, as from ^old of the ^ee^ or
loins from leaping or fear, cutting of wood^ or r^^ning d^wn a ^ill and the
lik^ these make the lig^^ents moist and loos^. Also it may be from cold after
childbearing, getting into the wom^ when the ^^rms flow, ^tting upon a cold
stone, and the like.

Plate^us.
Others say it comes from the solution of the conn^xion of the sibrous neck,
and the parts adj^^ent, and that is from the weight of the wom^ descending:
thi^ we deny not. But then the ligaments must be loose or broken. But women in
a d^op^e could not be said not to have the wo^^ f^ll down, if it came only from
looseness. B^^ the ^ause in them, is the ^^ltness of the water^ which dries more
then it moistneth.

The Signs.
I^ there be ^ little tumor within or without the pr^vities like a skin
stretched, or a weight ^elt about the p^ivities, it is only a descent of the
womb: but i^ there be a tumor like a Goose eg^ and a hole at the bottom, there
is at first a g^ea^ pain in the parts to which the womb is ^astned^ as the
loins, the bottom of the b^lly, an^ the pr^viti^s, and the os s^crum, ^^om the
stre^^hing (...) breaking of the ligaments: but a little after the pain
abateth, and there is an impediment in walking. Sometimes blood comes forth from
the breach of the vessels, and the dung and urin are stopped, and a F^aver and
Convulsion.

is hand to be cured, but not deadly, only it is troublesome and nasty. It
hinde^s conception, and keeps terms from flowing orderly. If it be with ^ain,
Fever or Convulsion, it is deadly, especially in women with child. That which
comes from corrosion of the ligaments^ is dangerous.

in^^amed or swollen. Therefore first give a Clyster to remove the excrements.
Then lay her upon her ba^k wit^ her l^gs abroad, and thighs lift^d up, her he^d
down, and take the tumor in your hands, and thrust it in without violence.

I^ it be swollen by alteration and cold, soment it with the D^coction of
Mallows, Althaea, Lin^ Foenugreek seed, Chamomil flowers, Bayberries, and
anoint i^ with oil of Lilli^s, and H^^s grease. If th^re be an inflammation,
put it not up yet. It Roder. ^ cas^o. de morb. m^l. 1. 2. c. 17.
may be ^righted in, by showing of a red hot iron, and actin^ as if you would
burn it.

First, sprinkle upon it the po^der of Mastich, ^^^^kincense, and the like. As,
Take Frankin^^ns^, M^st^^h, each two drams; Sarc^col steept in Milk ^ dram,
Mummy, Pomegranate ^^^wers, Sang^i^ Draconi^, each half a d^am.

When it is put up, let her lie with her legs stretched, and one upon the
other, for eight or ten dai^s, and m^ke a Pe^^^^^ like a P^ar^ of Cork o^
Sponge put into the womb, dipped in s^arp ^^ne o^ j^yce of Acacia, with powder o^
Sa^guis Draconis, Bole, Masti^h, or the Counte^ies Oynt^ent, with Galbanum and
Bdellium.

Apply a Cupping-glass with great flame under the navel or paps, or to both
kidneys, and lay this Plaster to the back. Take Opopanax two ounces, Storax
liquid half an ounce, Frankincense, Mastich, Pitch, Bole, each two drams; with
wax ma^e a Plaster. Or,

Take Labdanum a dram and half, Frankincense, M^stich, each half a dram; wood
Aloes, Cloves, Spik^, ea^h a dram; Ash colored Ambergr^ece four gr^i^^ Mu^k
half ^ s^ruple, make two r^und Plaister^ (...) be laid on eac^ side the Navel.
Make a Fume of a Snail ski^ falt^d, or of Garli^k, and let it be taken in by a
^unnel.

Use a^tringen^ ^omentations of ^ramble leaves, Pla^tane, Horstail, Mirtles,
each two handfuls; Wormwood two pugils, Pomegranate flowers half an ounce, bo l
them in wine and water. Or inject this with a Syringe. Take Coms^ey roots an
ounce, Snakeweed, Pomegranate flowers, each half an ounce; Rup^^rewort two
drams, Yarrow, Mugwort, each half an ounce; boil them in red Wine. Then use
Sulphur Baths.

To strengthen the Womb: Take Harts-born^ Bays, ^ach a dram; Mirrh hal^ a
dram, make a B^ud^r for two dos^s, give it with sharp wine. Or, Take Zedoary,
P^rsnep se^ds, Crabs e^es prepared, ^ach a dram; N^^m^g half a dram: give a
dram in p^uder, but use astringents warily, lest you stop the courses, and
cause worse mischief.

I^ it fall out from ^^il h^mors that flow to the womb, and loosen the
lig^unents, purge the body, and then ^se dryers, as the decoction of China,
Sarsa and Guajacum.

To keep it in its place, make Roulers and ligatures, as for the Rupture, and
use Pessaries into the bottom of the womb, that may force it to remain: of
which Fran^is Rousset has writ^en at Lib. de part^s caesar. sec. 6. cap. 3.
and 4.
large, and shows that they neither hinder conception, nor bring any
inconvenience, nay that they help conception, and retain it, and cure this
disease perfectly. And Gaspar Bau^inus confirms the same in his Appendix to
Rousset.

You may use Circles or Balls instead of Pessaries. As, Take roots of wild
Vine, make round Circles or Balls of them greater or less, as the Neck of the
womb is. Then, Take Virgin^ wax melted with white Rosin or Turpentine, dip the
b^lls in till they are fit, put one into the neck of the womb, that will hold
in being just fit: let it not be taken out till it fall out, and then put in
another, if she be not ^^red.

If it gangrene and sphacelate, cut it quite off, Lib. de pa^e ^es. sec. 4. ^.
5. histo. 6. Ibid. s^ct. 4. ^. 5.
if she fear cutting, take it off by ligature, of which Rousset who shows the
way, and says that it may be cut off without danger of life.

He tells also of the place where you must cut, and in Sect. 4. de partu
Caesareo, where the ligature is to be made.

Let the diet be drying, and astringent, and glewing, as Rice, Starch, Quinces,
Pears, green Cheese. Avoid Summer fruits: let the Wine be astringent and red.

The Cure of the inclining of the Womb.
When it inclines to the side, after Universals, apply Cupping-glasses to the
other side, and let her still lie on the other side; and let the Midwife anoint
her singer with Oil of sweet Almonds, and draw it a little by degrees to the
other side.

Chap. 17. Of the Rupture of the Womb.
FEw Physicians have seen this, I never read of any, but once I saw it, of
which in my institutions, lib. 2. p^rt. 1. cap. 9.

Chap. 18. Of Wounds, and breaking of the Womb.
IT is seldom wound^d, by reason of the diverse defenses it ^^th; but sometimes
the ^hirurgions wound it in cutting out of the child: of which Hollerius, inter
rara. no. 8. he speaks of a Woman with child in Paris, that her child's hand put
forth at the n^vel, and was so in travel fifteen days, and both child and
mother were safe.

The Signs.
It is evident, if it be made by the Surgeon in cu^^ing out of a child; and
you may know i^ by the place, if it come otherwise. There is blood and matter
that flows out at the neck of the womb. There is more pain when it is in the
ne^^ of the womb, then when it is in the bottom.

The Prognostic.
These wounds are cured, as appears by the Caesarean birth or cutting; but they
are dangerous, by reason of the strange Symptoms, and the consent of the parts.

The Cure.
Use Consolidaters or Heale^s; and if there be pain, Anodynes or Pessaries made
of Wax candles dipped in Wound-oyntments. Or,

Take Wax, Turpen^ine, Goose gre^se, Bu^^er, each a dram; Honey, Deer's marrow,
Oil o^ R^s^, Bulls grease, each two drams. Or, Take Fra^^ kincense, Mastich,
^eruss, Galba^^um, each half an ounce; mix them all with white ^ine, then ^d
Po^ph^lix an ounce, and wi^h Wax and Oil of Rose^, make an Ointment.

Make I^j^ctions or Clysters for the wo^b, of the Decoction of round Birthwort,
Cypr^ss boiled in steeled Water and sharp Wi^e, with a little Hydromel,
Agrimony, Mugwo^t, Plantane, Roses, S^haenanth, Ho^ehound.

Chap. 19. Of Ulcers and rottenness of the Womb.
THough the neck of the womb be only s^bj^ct to ulcers, as we showed; yet the
substance of womb has been ulcerated, and it has been observed to rot, when
it has fallen ^ut, and to fall away. * As we said of a Woman at A^inion, that
after lived some time. And the Examples of Rousset show that it may be safely
cut off.

Also a ^hild dead in the womb^ may cause an ulcer, as diverse Histories witness
in Albucasis, Li^ d^ pare ^es^^ chir^ c. 76.
and Alexander Benedictus, Maurici^s, Cord^^us, and many others.

How th^se ulcers and rottenness of the womb are cured, is said in Sect. 1.
cap. 8. where we sp^ke of Ulcers of the ne^k of the Womb, and Cap. 10. of
Fi^^ulaes of the Womb.

Chap. 20. Of the Diseases of the Stones, and Vessels of Procreation in Women.
IT is appar^nt by Hi^tories w^itten by grave and lea^ned M^n, that the sto^es
of women and there seed-vessels are many times grievously distempered, when the
womb joined to them is not. Sometimes water is gathered about the stones In
append. ad Roussetum 2. de par. caesar.
as Gaspar Bauhinus, John Schenkius write, and he has another History Lib.
Obser. 3 from John Heintz of a Maid, that desired a little before she died,
that her body might be opened to testify her innocence. In which besides other
things remarkabl^, the stones were found swollen as big as a head of a young
child; bluish and spungie, much water came out of them, and that made her
belly swel, and she taken to be with child: bu^ the truth appeared, and her
chastity testified.

THE FOURTH BOOK.
THE SECOND PART.
Of the Symptoms in the Womb, and from the Womb.
Chap. 1. Of weakness of the Womb.
THERE are many Symptoms from the womb. Of those in the womb: the first is
weakness, so that it cannot perform its actions.

The action of the womb is twofold, private and public. By its private action
it ^akes it nourishment of blood that comes to it. By its public action, it
serves for generation. If the private faculty be hurt, and the nourishm^nt not
well made, there is a super^luous moisture, and then weakness without other
fault of the organ or unity divided.

The first Cause is distemper, when the manifest The Causes
qualities are changed, or when the natural heat is suffocated or dispersed; or
when the occult qualities are changed. Heat in the womb makes a hot distemper,
if it be too much, by which the womb sucks more then it can concoct, this is
not prope^ly weakness: but that distemper i^ weakness, when the action is
either not done, or weakly done. But cold rather makes weakness in the womb, by
which it cannot make the sufficient quantity of nourishment, hence excremen^s
are heaped up, and it c^nnot perform its actions. Also a moist distemper makes
weakness, by which it can neither keep seed nor child; it is also weak from
looseness.

The Si^^s.
Little desire of Venery, and no pleasure therein, argue weakness of the womb,
flux of seed, often abortion, pain in the loins and pubes, when the terms are
coming; ^arts from the womb, headache, Part. 1. ^ect cap. 2. and 3.
and the like.

The signs of a cold and moist distemper with or without matter, are already
declared.

The Prognostic
It is a great disease, by reason of the diver^ Symptoms in women that have
conception hurt. It is worst when it comes from dispersing and extinguishing of
the natural heat.

The Cure.
We have showed how distempers of the womb are cured: but the dispersing of the
Spirits and natural heat, is cured by things that hinder the loss of Spirits,
and strengthen the womb, as Spices, Cinnamon, Cloves, Nutmeg, Mace,
Diacalaminth, Aromaticum ros^tum, Diaxilaloes, ros^ta Novella, Treacle,
Mithridate. Outwardly by Oil of Lillies, Nard, Lavender, and Astringents when
the womb is loose.

Things that help the womb in the whole subs^^n^e, are in the Chapter of the
cold and moist Di^^emper, as Aqua vitae for Women. Or this, Take Castor three
ounces, Saffron two ounces, extract them si^gular, add to both Extract of
Mugwort two o^nces, of Angelica a dr^m, Magistery of the mother of Pearl ^
dram, Oil of Cloves a s^ruple, of Angeli^^, and of Amber, and of Nutmegs, each
half a scruple.

Let her ea^ meat of much nourishm^nt, and drink good Wine.

Chap. 2. Of the Itch of the Womb.
THis is more in old then young wome^^ and must be distinguished from the
Frenzy of the womb: for here is only a desire to scrath the privities, so that
they cannot sleep. Nor is it with desire of copulation, as in the fury of the
womb.

It is a salt humor that is serous and adust that The Causes
causes it, that is sent to the neck of the womb, and the privities. How it
comes there, I shew^d in Ulcers of the privities.

It is known by her relation, and often putting her hand to the privities.

The Prognostic. The Cure.
It is more troublesome then dangerous, becau^^ it hinders sleep.

First, purge the whole body, and if there a^^ signs of plethory, and strength
permits, bleed i^ the arm. Then qualify the sharp ^alt h^mors, with cold and
moist means, and r^mov^ them from the privities. Foment with a D^coction of
Lettice, Plantane, Willow, Dock roo^s, and then anoint with Galen^ Cooler. Or
dip ^ Pessary in this Ointment, and put it in. O^, T^ke Alum, Nit^r, Sulphur,
each six drams; S^^phisager an oun^e, with Rose-vinegar and fresh Butter, make
a Linimens.

If these will not cure, use stronger, as the ointment of Elicampane with
Quick^ilver. Or, Take black Soap, Staphisacre, ^ach a dram; qui^k Brimstone
half an ounce, Quick silver two drams, wi^^ Rose-vinegar and Hogs grease, make
an Ointment.

Let the me^t be of good juy^e, coolin^ and moist^^ng. Take heed of Spices,
sharp and salt meats.

Chap. 3. Of pain in the Womb.
THere is pain in the body of the womb wit^ other diseases sometimes: as the
Co^^ckpains woven in the bottom of the belly, and in the loins and hips; and is
called the Pain of the Womb. It is often in women with child, as the
inflammation of the womb; it is burning and beating, it binds the belly, and
stops the urin.

The Causes
Solution of unity is the Cause of all pains, and this is from the stretching
of the womb and its vessels, or corrosion. Stretching is from wind, or clotted
blood in the cavity o^ it, and when Nature cannot expel it by reason of the
straitness of the part, there is pain.

Also pain is from stretching of the vessels before the terms flow, when they
are close, and the blood thick, and this pain is increased by external cold,
especially after heat. Sometimes there is a gathering o^ humors about the womb,
when the terms ^^ow, and are ^oul, and they get into the membranes, and stretch
them. The same may be from corrupt seed, that stretches the vessels.

Or from sharpness and corrosion in the neck ^f the womb, when sharp humors
flow through it, and tw^tch it.

The pain is manifest, but let us look at the The Signs.
^igns o^ ^he causes. If it be from clotted blood, there was a flux of the
same, and the pain is fixed about the ori^ice of the womb. If there were
external causes, the patient will relate. If it be from seed, there is
suffocation of the womb.

The greater the cause is, and the more vehement The Pr^gnostick.
it works, the more is the danger.

If there be pain, and fear of fainting, look to The Cur^.
that before the cause, with Anodynes and Narco^icks if need be.

If it be from wind^ see inflation of the womb.

If i^ be from clotted blood, di^^olve and eva^uate it, with hot and
attenuating Medicines, made into Fomentations, Baths and Oyntmen^s. It is good
to apply Treacle to the region of the womb, or put it in with Rue and Honey. Or
give a Clyster to the womb, of Ru^, Foenugre^k s^ed, and Oil of Rue and Orris.
Or give (...) and Cinnamon water.

If the vessels of the womb are not open enough for the terms. See in the
stoppage of the terms.

If there be wind, make a Clyster thus. Tak^ Mer^ury, Mugwort, Cal^mints,
Pennyroyal, ea^h (...) hand^ul; Chamomil and Melilot flowers, each ha^^ a
hand^ul; (...) an^ Line^eed, each an oun^e; boil them, in a pint strained,
dissolve Hiera, Be^tdicta laxativa, each half an ounce; ^a^e a Cl^^^^r. Give
Mugwort, Zedoary water, Essence of Ca^^^r, Treacle, or ^omens Aqu^ vit^e, of
which before.

Make a Clyster for the Womb, thus. Tak^ Mugwort, Calamints, Bettony, each h^l^
a hand^^^; Gith, Cummin, Carrot, Aniseed^, ea^h a dram; Spi^e, Schoenanth,
Nutmeg, Cinnamon, e^^h (...) dram; boil them in Wine.

Then fill an Ox bladder half full with Oil of Lillies and Dill, and apply it
to the belly.

Or, T^ke Oil of Lillies, Orris, each an oun^e; distilled Oil of Angelic^ a
dram, Goose and He^s g^e^se, each half an ounce; Muci^^g^ of Lin^ and
Faenugreek seed made with Mu^w^rt w^^er, ea^h three drams; seeds of Cummin,
C^rr^ts, Carawa^, each a dram; with W^x m^ke a soft Ointment. O^, Take
Pe^^itor^ two hand^uls, Mercury a handful, beat them, add Chamomil flowers,
Cummin, Anise, Carrot seeds, each a dram; two yolks of Eggs and Oil of Lillies,
make a Cataplasm for the belly.

Apply Plasters to the Navel, and Cuppin^glasses with great flame to the
Region of the Womb; or dry Fomentations of Oats Mi^ium, Anise, Cummin, Carrot
seed in a Bag. And use Pessaries, as^ Take Hearts marrow, Turpentine, Wax, Goose
grease, each ^hree drams; Saff^on a dram, yol^s of Eggs seven, with Oil of
Lillies, m^ke Pessaries.

If the humors and wind is mali^nant, mi^ Scorzonera, Bezoar seeds, and roots
of An^elica, w^ter of Zedoary, Tre^cle, Mithridate, and the like in Suffocation
of the Womb.

Chap. 4. Of the Diseases of Womb, that come from sweet scents and stinks.
THere is a particular Symptom in the womb which b^eeds great admiration, that
it deli^hts ^n sweet scents, and is offended with stinks; and it is certain,
for if Musk, Civet, or the like, be but put to the nose of a woman that is
subject to ^i^s of the Mother, they grow sick, and if the some be put to their
privities, and stinks to the nos^, the ^it of the Mother cease.

It is hard to give the reason of this, many wi^e Men have given their opinion^
but they dis^gree among themselves, and ^atisfie me not, neither do I p^omise
to satis^ie others. But it is probable to me that the womb is not delighted
with scents, as scents, for the privities have no smelling, and the sen^e of
^melling does not reach so ^ar: but the quality by which it is well or ill, is
occult, and not to be explained, and not to be ^^parated from the odours.

If any ask what that quality is. I answer, the^e are many qualities in Nature
that are hid from our senses, and yet we cannot deny them, because we see their
effects, as the quality in a Dogs nose, we cannot apprehend but the Dog
perceives it.

But how these qualities come to the womb, is Quomodo u^erus ben^ olentia
r^cipi^t.
by no other way but by the open way by the p^ivi^ies, by which Spirits get
into the womb, and in the su^^o^ation of the womb ^weet thin^s p o^it, because
they strengthen it by a peculiar quality to disperse the venomous air, and draw
down Quomodo been olentia hystericis noceant.
the Spirits and humors. But if they be put to the nose^ the womb consents by
the Sympathy of the organ of smelling, and the brain with it.

This is by the nerves and arteries; for the heart is presently refreshed with
a sweet scent, because it presently pierces into it being ^pirit^al, and there
is a great consent of the womb with the brain and the smelling, as is seen by
the trial of barrenness, by a Fume from Hippocrates. 5. Aphor.


But we must observe that sweet scents are acceptable to all wombs, and stinks
are not, but the same Symptoms are not in all women from them; for they who
have a womb of a good constitution with no evil humors in it, endu^e sweet
things well, and delight in them, but they who are unclean, hate sweet things,
and often (...) into ^its by them, because while the womb is delighted with
that sweet and hidden quality with which it has a peculiar Sympathy, the evil
humors that lie in the womb (especially if there be any corruption from seed)
and the seed also are stirred, and when the Spirits fly up, the^ take the bad
humo^s with them, and send bad vapors to the heart which cause suffocation, and
other Symptoms. But when the same scents a^e put to the privities, the womb is
refreshed with them, and the Spirits are quiet^ or move to the scents. And so
the humors (if there be any) are still, or else move downward. But stinks on
the contrary, by reason of their Antipathy with the womb, are voided by the
Spirits, and so the humors move downwards, and often the^e is an abortion
thereby.

What is spoken of sweet scents, may be understood of all sweet things, and
this our judgment in a matter so difficult.

THE FOURTH BOOK.
THE SECOND SECTION.
Of the Symptoms in the Terms, and other Fluxes of the Womb.
Chap. 1. Of the Flux of the Terms.
BY divine providence the blood which is voided every month is kept in when
there is a child; for if it be its nature, it is not ill, but only
superfluous, till they conceive, nor is it more an excrement then seed and milk.

The Terms commonly begin at fourteen, and then the hair appears on the
privities, the breasts swell, and women begin to be lecherous* and the blood
can no longer stay in the veins, but breaks ^ut at the veins of the womb.

In some they begin at twelve, and they are ^ery lustful commonly, and of
shorter lives: they ^on^inue till fifty; in some till sixty, and then ^op. In
some they begin at sev^n^^en or eigh^en. And in some they stop (...) fifty,
accor^ing to the variety of Nature and diet.

Nature does not send ^ort^ ev^ry (...) what is ^^thered, but sta^es till the
plenty o^^^nds, and ^oth only once in a month, otherwis^ it would (...) filthy
and unpleasant, and hinde^ co^^ep^ion. (...) do they flow at one time in all
ex^ctly, but (...) are twenty two days, or at most th^^ty be^^en the purgings.

In some they last three days, which was usual (...) the time of Hippocrates.
In some four or five (...) more, as their Liver is reater, or their diet is
(...) or lower.

Hippocrates says, They should bleed but a pint (...) half, or two pints: this
is not alike in all, (...) differs in respect of age and diet.

As for the quality, it must not be too thick no^ (...) thin, but of a middle
substance, without sent a red color, yellower in choleric persons, in
^lancholick, black; in phlegmatic, whiter, and ^ust flow without any great
Symptom.

The passages are the veins of the womb, being ^uble from the double branch on
both sides it, (...) Spermati^k and Hypogastrick, that they may (...)
superf^ui^ies from all parts.

And from this Description of a natural flux, (...) may gather what is
preternatural.

Question 1. Whether can a Woman conceive, that never had her Terms?
They are called by some Flowers, because they go before conception, as flowers
do before fruit; but many have ^onceived that never (...) their flowers, being
hotter by Nature, as the (...) d^ans that never have any flowers; and Vir^
goe's that use more exercise: but if these (...) no more blood then will nourish
their body, the are ^arren.

I^ any thing abound, that is not required (...) nour^^hment of the parts, and
it so much the Nature cannot endure it in the body, the wo^ draws it to it when
it has conceived, to man up the child: of which herea^ter

Question 2. Whether menstruous blood is only superfluo^s in quantity, or bad
in respec^ quality?
Writers disagree about this. Some say i^ bad in quantity and quality, and
venemou^^ the effects, as making Ivory obscure, and (...) Looking-glasses,
corrupting Wine, by a (...) from the body of a Woman that has (...) flower.

Others say they offend only in plenty: (...) it were venomous, it could not be
a whole mo^ in the body, and it could not form the child, (...) would Nature
make milk of it.

Therefore menstrual blood only offends quantity, and not in any mani^e^t or
hidden q^lity. But it has strange qualities when it is (...) with bad humors,
or is kept too long in body to be corrupted, and cause great Sy^toms; but this
is when it is mix^^ with bad mors, or is out of its vessels, and so corrupts

Question 3. Of the ^ext of Aristotle 7. de hist. Animalium, c^p^^. and how it
is to be underst^od?
Aristotle writes thus, Constantly every month 7. De histo. any. c. 2.
^ome have their Terms: but most in the third, as ^f he should say, Few women
have their courses ^very month, but many have them every third ^onth. This is
against Galen, and against expe^ience, for it is certain, that among six
hundred women, scarce one has them every third month. Therefore there is
either an error in the Greek Text, or in the Translation, or great Men do
often (...) which is probable, and so did Arist tle in this of Physic.
Therefore it is in vain to defend their ^rrour.

Chap. 2. Of the Terms flowing too soon.
ORdinarily they begin at fourteen; but many have had them sooner. A child of
ele^en days old had a bloody humor flowing from (...) privities. Another of
five years old had every month a moderate flux. Fernel reports that Her.
saxoni^ vidit venetiis ser. 6. p^r^. 5. c. 1^6.
Girl of eight years old had the Terms: but these (...) rare, and for the most
part very lecherous, (...) short lived.

Chap. 3. Of want and stopping of the Terms.
SOme Women have them not till eighteen or twenty. Some before, and then they
stop for a time without, either giving suck, or being with child. Some have
been without them three, five or seven months, and then they came again This is
an evil constitution, or suppression of th^^ which it ought to flow, from the
fault of the blood and stoppage of the passages.

The Causes
When Terms are wanting either blood is wanting, o^ stopped. It is wanting,
either because it i^ not made, or dispersed or turned to other use^, for nature
being more sollicito^s to preserve the individual person, then to propagate the
speci^s, spends (...) in preserving of the person.

Blood is not made from diverse causes, as a^e, cold constitution of ^iver,
Heart, or a disease which distempers the ^^wels. Or often bleeding from great
vessels, or ^^om having many issues, which take from the blood.

It is spent other ways, as before ripe age, an^ when women are with child, or
give suck, or i^ hot Natures, and fat women, in whom it is tu^ned to fat. It is
in vain to provoke Terms i^ these.

There are other external evident causes of s^^^ping of the Terms, as too great
labor, trouble^ ^adness, fear; but these last do not only wast (...) blood,
but cool and corrupt it, and cause obs^^ctions, 6. Epid. s^^. 8. in ^ine.
as Hippocrates speaks of Phatusa the (...) of Pytheus.

The proper causes are, the straitness of (...) passages, or evil conformation
of the (...) through which it should slow. Or the closin^ the womb, of which we
spoke, but I speak (...) of the ve^sels.

The usual cause of obs^^uction, is thick (...) humors, from the blood too
think, or mixed (...) melancholy which comes with it to the vei^^ the womb, and
stops them.

This thick blood comes from a cold distemper of the stomach, liver and spleen,
from thick and gross food, and drinking cold water when the Terms flow. So
thought Galen in his time Lid de venae s^c alversus erasistrat.
of the Roman women that drank Snow-water^ and had few or no courses^

Straitness is when the body of the womb is made thicker, either by Nature or
other causes; as a cold and dry, or hot and dry diste^per.

Thirdly, straitness is from compression of the vessels, by a Scirrhus or
hardness of the parts adjacent, as the straight gut, or by the stone in the
bladder, and the womb displaced.

Fourthly, the flesh may grow together by a membrane that grows to the vessels,
or a ^^ar after a wound. Or after a mischance, when the veins annexed to the
Secundine, grow so together, that they cannot be opened: of which in the first
Question.

They are not the same in women and Virgins, The Signs.
for blood stopped in Virgins, goes to and ^ro, changes the color, and brings
Fevers, especially the white Fever or Green Sickness.

But in women it goes more to the womb, and brings Symptoms, as loathing,
vomiting, and Pica.

Galen has other signs, as heaviness, a lazy 8. De loaff. c. 5.
pain in the loins, neck, and behind in the head, that reaches to the roots of
the eyes, from the sp^eading of the blood stopped through the whole body. This
laziness is chie^ly in the thighs and legs, by reason of the veins there
consenting with the womb. And are of a green complexion, and hairy, with a
beard, and shrill voice.

You may know women with child, from such a^ want their Terms, only by p^^per
signs. First the women with child keep their color, but the other are pale and
ill-c^loured; they are merry, the other sad. 2. Their Symptoms daily grow
milder, but in the other they daily grow worse. 3. You may feel the child move.
4. It is perceived in a month.

You shall know from what causes the Terms are stopped, thus. If the Liver be
cold, there is no blood made that is superfluous, and there are signs of a ^old
Liver, and you may know that blood is not sent to the womb, when there is no
heaviness, pain, or tumor about the womb, the liver or spleen are stopped.

If it be from phlegm or melancholy, which is often, there are signs of their
abounding, as laz^ness, paleness, seldom pulse, crude urin.

Hippocrates says, That if the Terms stop, ther^ The Prognostic. Hippo. morb.
mulier. Gal. 6. de lo. aff. c. 5.
are diseases in the womb, tumors, imposthumes, ulcers and barrenness, and
diseases in the whole body, Greensickness, Leucophlegmacy, Dropsy, Vomiting of
blood, Heart-ach, Cough. And the longer they have been stopped, the ha^der they
are to be opened. If the blood stop^ go out at the nose, it is good.

If it have great Symptoms, there is fear of Hippo. 5. apho. 23.
death.

You must not give Medicines to move the Terms, to extenuate lean persons, nor
to such as want blood, and have a weak Liver, but they must be sed high.

First see i^ blo^d abound, and then (after a Leni^ive) open a vein^ and let
that blood which C^m. in 6. ^p^^. 3. ^. ^9
is in the veins, be drawn to the womb. Gal^^ took th^ee ^ints of blood at
three times from (...) le^n wom^n, and cured her of an old stopping (...) the
Terms.

You must open the ankle vein^, the first day the right, the next the left,
four or five days before the time. Or you may cup and ^^ari^ie the Legs.

And bind the parts below, and rub them after general evacuation, opening of
the Haemorrhoids does hurt, and so do Issues, because they draw from the womb.

Hiera picra hal^ an ounce, or Pills de T^ibus, o^ Hiera simple are good first.

Then prepare, as; Take water of Mugwort, (...) Maidenhair, ^a^h three ^u^ces;
Syrup o^ ^he five Roots, and of Mugwort, each two ounces; ma^e it for two
doses. Or, Take op^ning Roots half an ounce, Madder, Burn^^, ea^h three ounces;

For phlegmatic Bodies, take the Decoction of Guajacum, Sa^^aphras, Dittahy for
fifteen d^^es without sweating.

Then evacuate with Agarick, Mechoacan, Turbith, Scammony, Coloquintida, bla^k
Hellebore. As,

Take Agarick two drams, infuse it in Mugwort^^ter two ounces, O^ymel an ounce,
strain, and the E^tract of Michoacan a s^ruple. Or, Take op^nin^ Roots half an
ounce, Mugwort, Bettony, ^^ch (...) pugils; Senna ^^l^ an ^unce, Agari^k two
dra^^ (...) and Ani^^^d, each a ^^ru^^e; (...) ha^^ a dram, R^s^mary flowers
(...) ^ugil, in^^^e (...) th^^e oun^^^ an^ ^a^f, ^d S^rup of Senna ^n (...) a^^

Or, Take Diaturbith with R^ubarb half an ounce, Mechoacan two drams, Agarick a
dram, Diarrhodon^ Cinnamon, each half a dram; Steel prepared a dram, with
Raisons make an Electuary^ give as much as a Wall nut.

Or give Pills of Agarick foetidae, and so continue purging and ^reparing, if
the matter be stubborn. Or, Take Agarick two drams, Mader a dram, with Syrup of
Mugwort, make Pills. Or, Take Aloes three drams, de Tribus o^e dram, with juice
of Savin make Pills^

If the stomach is soul, give a Vomit, le^t it g^^ into the veins.

Then give provokers of the Terms which are Par. 1. sec. 2. c. 2.
hot and thin, about the time they used to flow: they are three degrees in
strength, and many so^t^ of Medicines are made of them.

A Powder. Take Cinnamon a dram, Amb^r^ s^ruple, Saffron half a scruple. Or,
Take Trochu of Mirrh, of Wall^flowers, each a scruple; Saffron five grains. Or,
Take Castor, Pennyroyal, each a scruple; with Wine or proper Waters.

Physical Wine. Take Madder roots an ounc^, Orr^s half an ounce, Balm,
Pennyroyal, Mugwort^ Rosemary, e^ch a handful; Wall-flowers half a p^gil,
Cinnamon an ounce, Galangal half an oun^^, with Wine: give four ounces.

Or, Take the D^c^ction of red Pease. Or, Take Smallage, Fennel roots, each
half an ounce; Mugwort, Bett^ny, Pennyroyal, Balm, each a handful; red Pe^^e
half an handful, Juniper Berries half a^ ounce, (...) all flowers a pugil, boil
and sweeten it. O^ Take ^en ounces of it with thr^^ ounces of Mugw^^^ for three
doses.

Quer^^tan commends this. Take Gromwels^eds, Anise, M^slet^ of the Oak, each
three drams; Dittany a dram, Saffron a s^ruple, ^rui^^, and keep them twenty
four hours in Wine then boyl^them: give f^^r ounces for three dai^s together.

Or make the Woman's ^qua vi^^e. Or, Take Balm, ^tt^ny, Pennyroyal, M^^wort,
N^p, Mothe^wort, Dittany, ^ach four handfuls; Wine thirty pints, distill them,
add three handfuls of each h^rbs, and distill them again, and ad Fennel seed,
Calamus, Cinnamon, Cassia lign^a, Cardamoms, each half an ounce: distill them
again.

Or give Syrup of Calamints^ Mugwort. Or, Take water of Pennyroyal, Savin,
Calamints, each four ounces; Syrup of Mugw^rt ^^ur ounces, Cinnamon water an
ounce: give it at f^ur times.

Rouls. Take Extract of Savin a scruple, of Angelica half a s^ruple, of
Elicampane six grains, Oil of Cinnamon five drops, of Cloves two drops, with
S^gar dissolved in Balm wa^er. Or make an Electuary of Steel six ounces, Cassia
lignea, Cinnamon, each two drams; Cloves a dram, Raisons two ounces, with Sugar

third day pills of Hier^.

Use outward Medi^ines, but p^ovoke not sweat ^y them.

Take Althaea and Lill^ ro^ts, each two ^unces; (...) an ^un^e, M^ll^w^,
M^r^ury, M^gwort, (...) M^therwort, Calamint^, P^nn^royal, M^r^^ram, Bay^^^

Faenugre^^^ s^^d an ounc^, Juniper an^ Bayberri^s, each ^alf a han^^^l: b^^l
^h^m in Water, (...) wi^h ^p^^ges.

And then anoint with this. Take Oil of Lillies an ounce, o^ Lavender seeds
stilled hal^ a dram, Calamints and Gith powder, each a dram; Storax calamint a
scruple.

To Virgins that must take no Pessaries, give Fumes, with the head defended;
they will ^pen the mouths of the vessels, and cut thick humors.

As, Take Mirrh, Bdellium, Storax, each a dram; Benzoin two scruples, Gallia
mos^hata, ivet, each half a scruple; with liquid Storax make Troches.

Then use Clysters and Injections into the Womb with Purgers. As, Take
Calamin^s, Pennyroyal, each a handful; Gith seed, Turbi^h, each a dram;
Coloquintida half a dram, boil it in wine, inject it into the womb.

If it be hot after it, inject the Decoction of Mallows with Milk or Barley
water. And because the neck of the womb lies upon the strait gut, give
Clysters. Take Lilly roots an ounce, Orris, Valerian, ^ach half an ounce;
Mercury two handfuls, Mugwort, Savin, each a handful; Chamomil, Lavender
flowers, each a pugil; Caraway, Gith seed, each a dram: boil, add Hiera and

Bayberries half an ounce.

If she be no Virgin, put Mercury bruised in a Bag for a Pessary, with Centaury
flowers. Or Garlic beaten with Oil of Spike.

Begin still with the mildest, as Mugwort, Mercury, Pennyroyal, Marjoram, Rue;
and then add Mucilages and Juyces to loosen the womb^ let ^ot Pessaries lie
long, least they cause a Fever.

If it be from a tumor, provoke not the Terms, but lo^k to the tumor.

Let diet be hot and attenuating of good juice, with Parsley, Savory, Rosemary,
Cloves, Cinnamon. Little sleep and much exercise.

Question 1. Whether are the other Causes of stoppage of the Terms?
Some say the blood going to other parts, is a cause, but it is rather
contrary, and the suppression of Terms is cause of that; ^or the veins of the
womb are large enough to evacuate blood.

Others say the strength of the womb is a cause, which thi^kens the vessels,
that they receive no blood. But the womb is made to receive it when it abounds.

Others accuse the strength, which is to be denied, but when it is so strong,
that it is too hot or too dry, and will not receive the blood, and that is a
sign of weakness. But there must be strength in the whole body, to cast out
superfluous blood, or there will be other mischiefs.

Question 2. What Veins must be opened when the Terms are s^opt?
Authors disagree in this, as Aetius and Galen, L. de sang. miss. cap. 11. 18.
19.
who always speaks of the ankle veins: and most are of his mind, being it is
rational. For a vein opened in the arm, does rather revel from the womb, then
draw the blood to it; but in the ankle, brings it to its place, and opens
obstructions, and does both lessen, and bring blood to the womb, and move that
which is in the womb ^ixed.

Open the ankle therefore twice or thrice, rather Lib. de sang. mis. adver.
^r^sis.
then the arm once. Therefore Galen commends Hippocrates that he opened a vein
in the ankle in the Servant of Schimarg, though she had a Pl^thory^

But in other diseas^s of the womb, as inflam^ation dropping, or too many
Terms, it is good to open a vein in the arm. The Saphena is opened by putting
the foot in warm water, before and after.

Question 3. At what time must a Vein be opened against the s^^ppage of the
Terms?
Galen says, It must ^e when Nature may be helped, be the blood moved: that is
three or four days before the usual time of their coming, as if she had them
alwai^s in the full of the Moon, and they have been stopped some months^ bleed
three or four d^ies before the full, to pu^ nature in mind of her duty, and to
make the blood run again.

Chap. 4. Of fewness of the Terms.
IT is when they flow less then they use or ought to ^low.

It is either from the blood, or in the expulsive The Causes
faculty in the passages. As if blood ^e little, the Terms are few and slow, if
the retentive faculty is weak, and the expulsive strong, they come at due time,
but in small quantity. If the Terms are slow, the fault is in the quality of
the blood being too thick. Also straitness of the passages may be a cause, for
if they be not wide enough, the blood cannot flow f^eely.

The patient will tell the disease, but the cause The Signs.
of it is to be found in the Chapter a^oregoing.

Few Terms from little blood is not dangerous, The Pr^gnostick.
if they be stopped from thick blood, there follow diseases: as Erysipelas,
Scirrhus or Cancer.

See the Chapter aforegoing for the Cure, and The Cure.
and if it be from thickness of blood, it is often cured by a general Purge for
the whole body.

Chap. 5. Of Dropping of the Terms.
THis is a flux, and lasts long, and there is pain.

The blood flows not conveniently at the due time and manner, and the privities
are always wet, as when the urin drops.

Are from the blood and the passages of it, and The Causes

Nature to let it out, and because it stretches the membranes, the^e is pain.
Also the weakness of the retentive faculty is a cause.

blood and sharp and strait passages, there is a s^^etching pain about the
womb. If it be from c^udity of blood, and weakness of the retentive ^aculty,
the blood flows without pain, and is not much ^elt.

It is troublesome to women, and if it last long, The Prognostic. The Cure.
^auseth ulcers and inflammations.

It is all in mending of the thick and sharp blood, and in opening the
passages, which are ^he two chief causes of it, of which we spoke at ^rge.

If blood be superfluous, loose it not, nor open the ankle-vein, lest you draw
it more to the womb, but take away the Cacochymy.

If it be from weakness of the retentive faculty, strengthen the womb with
dryers and ash ingents.

Chap. 6. Of the overflowin of the Terms.
IT is when it is too much or too long, and hur^s any woman, and brings
diseases, but a certain proportion of bleeding is not to be de^ined; but too
much is lost when the actions are hurt.

The immediate Cause is the opening of the The Causes Gal. 3. de sympt. causis
^. 2. and 5. aph. com. 57.
vessels, and the mediate cause is the blood in quantity or quality offending,
or by its force or disorderly motion.

Vessels are opened by Anastomosis, Diapedesis, Diaeresis or ruption, or by
Diaurosis or co^rosion. Anastomosis is from a moist distemper of the vessels^
which loosneth the orifices, or from external causes, as Baths, hot and moist:
or us^ of Aloes.

The flux is seldom too great from a Diapedesis, for it is but a sweating
through. Ruption is from plethory, when the Terms have long been stopped, and
then break out, and when the bloo^ is hot by air, baths, etc. The outward
causes are falls, strokes, hard travel, great burdens lifted.

Erosion is from sharp blood or humor, or from Medicines that corrode, as
Pessaries long kept. For this great flux is chiefly from the veins in the
bottom of the womb.

The flux of blood is too great, when the The Signs.

The signs of the causes. If it be from mu^lr blood, there are signs of
plethory, and it easily ^lotteth together. If the blood be sharp and chol^rick,
it is putre^ied in the womb, you shall know waterish blood by its color, and
the signs of that humor abounding: and if you dip a clout in it, and dry it in
the shade, you may see it. If the womb be too moist, such causes went before.
If it be from breaking of veins, they will tell you of violence. If it be from
corrosion, it is little and slow, sometimes pure, sometimes ^erous.

It wea^n^th the whole body, the liver and bowels, The Prognostic.

Rose^water and red Wine, put an ounce of Mastich in the belly of it, stick it
on, and roast it, and bast it with Vinegar of Roses. Then put it into a glass
close luted, to be dried in an oven; then beat all of it to powder. Give a
spoonful with Plantane water, or an astringent D^coction. Anoint the bottom of
the belly, ^eins and groyns, with the dropping of it.

Or make Rouls thus. Take Bole half a dram, Magistery of Coral a dram, Pearl
prepared a scr^ple, Sorrel and Plantane seed, each half a dram; Aromaticum
rosatum, Traganth, each half a dram; with Sugar dissolved in Plantane water,
make Rouls.

In the use of cold As^ringents, take heed you s^op not the veins, and the heat
be cooled. If these help not, use Narcoticks, a^ Troches of sealed Earth, and
Amber with O^i^m: these astringe also.

U^e no Pessaries, except the veins in the neck o^ the wo^b be open. As, Take
Sn^keweed, Tormentil, each half an ounce; Pomegranate flowers, Plantane seed,
each two drams; Comfrey roots (...) Frankincense, Mastich, each a dram; Ac^ci^,
Sanguis Draconis, each two scruples; Bloodstone, Starch, each a dram and half;
with the while of an Eg, and Gum traganth dissolved in Rose water, make
Pessaries with red Silk.

Womb-clysters. Take juice of Yarrow, Solomon's seal, each two ^unces; Mucilage
of Gum Arabic made in Plantane water two ounces, make a Clyster.

A Fume. Take Frankincense, Mastich, each two drams; Mirtles, Labdanum, each a
dram; red Roses, Pomegranate flowers, each half a dram; with Gum traganth make
Tro^hes to be burnt.

Ointments. Take Oil of Mirtles, Quinces, each two ounces; juice of Plantane,
Solomon's seal, Horstail, each an ounce; boil the juyces away, ad Bole, Plantane
seed. Myrtle berries, Ceruss, each half an ounce; with Wax make an Ointment. Or
use the Countesses Ointment to the loins and pec^en.

Cataplasms. Take Quinces, Pears boiled in red Wine, add Bole, Mastich, Sanguis
Draconis, Ac^cia, make a Cataplasm or a Cerot. Or, Take Sorr^l and Plantane
seed, Purslane seed, Bole, Sanguis Draconis each two drams; Frankincens^,
Mastich, Mirrh, each three drams; Turpentine an ounce, wi^h juice of Plantane
and Yarrow and Wax, make a Cerot after the juyces are boiled away.

Fomentations are better then Baths, for they make the humors flow more. Let
them be astringent, and cool. Or wash the legs and hips in cold water. Lay
Epithems to the Liver, Ointments, Cerots, or Plasters.

If choler offend, give Rhubarb and Cons^rve of Roses to evacuate the Cacochymy.

If blood flow from a vein broken, use Coral, Bole, Mirtles, Comfrey, Acacia,
Hypocistis: or apply a Pultis of whites of Eggs, and astringent Pouders.

If it come from a vessel corroded, use stoppers and glutinaters that a^e
slimy, as Dropwort roots a dram, with a rear Eg.

Let the diet be as the Physic is. In a flux from plethory, eat little, and
that of little nourishment, and in other cases give things to close the
vessels. Sleep long, and use little Venery, little or no exercise. An^er hurts,
and other passions.

Question. Whether Frictions or Ligatures in the Legs may be made for Re^ulsion?
Hippocrates and Galen are misconstrued in his 8. Book of Blood-letting, and
they are not to be used in the flux of the Terms.

Chap. 7. Of the Terms flowing with pain and Symptoms.
THe Symptoms are pain in the loins or thighs, headache, biting at the mouth
of the stomach, pain in the belly and loins, fainting.

They are as in suppression of Terms, but less The Causes
vehement, and are in them that have not conceived. There is obstruction, thick
and gross blood, that stretches the vessels, and the blood flows not orderly.

A little before the Terms, there is headache, The Sig^s.
biting at the stomach, pain in the loins, and bottom of the stomach, with
beating at the heart, and ^ainting. When the pain is from thick blood, it comes
forth in ^lodds, and the pain is worse before. If it be from wind, it is
sudden, and st^ies not in a place, and there is rumbling in the belly.

^he (...)
Take heed it tu^n not to the stoppage of terms, if it be neglected. It is
greater in barren women and Virgins, then in those have had children.

^^e Cure.
Take away the cause; if they be thick humors, evacuate them after they are
prepared: if sharp, temper them. These attenuate blood, water of Grass roots,
Maidenhair, Decoctions of the opening Roots, Syrup of Maidenhair, o^ the five
Roots, Treacle, and the like in the stoppage of the Terms.

Against pain, ^se the Fomentations and Ointments in the Chapter of pain of the
Womb.

Chap. 8. Of evil discolored Terms.
THis is called the Terms depraved by bad humo^s, and so they are voided.

The Caus^s
Blood is foul, either from evil diet, or evil humors, or stoppage of it. The
humors are phlegm, choler, or melancholy mixed with it, and then the Te^ms are
either pale, blew, green, or black and stinking^ or white and phlegmatic. They
are so from a fault in the stomach. The pale and yello^ are a^e from too great
heat in the liver. The bla^k ar^ from the spleen disordered.

(...) Si^^^.
Tha^ blood which is natural^ is different from the b^d in color and
substance: it is like that ^f a new ^^ain sheep, no^ thi^ker nor thinner, and
^he ^ad Terms come no^ ^e^sonably, but soon^^ or later^ of which Hippocrates.
You may know Lib. de morb. mulier.
by the color what humor predominates, and by the sub^tance. The phlegmatic
and mela^choly are long in coming, and the choleric waterish Terms come
q^icker.

The more they di^^er from the natural s^ate, The Prognostic.
the worse they are, black and stinking are worst. The matte^y are wo^st of
all. If these flow seven, eight or nine d^ies, she is cured: if they ulcerate
the womb, she is barren.

Hippocrates says they must be purg^d and prepared The Cure. 5. Aphor. 36.
with proper things, as we showed in the distempers of the Womb. But take heed
that you move not the Terms when you attenuate, for that will melt the ^erous
humors, and fix them more in the vessels: use neither Vinegar no^ sharp things.

After purging, consume the relics by sweat; if choler be in fault that must
not be sweated out, discuss it with warm Baths, and do so in melancholy. Use
Pessaries, Fomentations and Fumes to the womb.

Give Treacle, Mithridate, or the Decoction of An^elica roots, if cold humors
are the cause.

Chap. 9. Of Terms coming before their time.
THese show an ill constitution. And it is a depraved excretion of the Terms
that comes for the time often, f^r sometimes they fl^w sooner, or twice in a
month.

The immediate Cause is hurt of the retentive The Causes
and expul^ive faculty, so that the blood flows not or sooner or late^, or
oftener: the cause why they come sooner, is in the blood that stirs^up the
expulsive faculty in the whole body, or in the womb: sometimes all causes meet,
the blood is too much, or too sharp and hot; and if the retentive faculty in
the womb be weak, and the expulsive strong^ and of quick sense, it is sooner.

A fall, stroke or passion are the evident Causes.

The Signs.
They will relate it: and the signs of the causes are these. If it be from much
blood, there are the signs of plethory; heat, thinness, and sharp humors are
known by the distemper of the whole. The weakness of the retentive faculty, and
looseness of the vessels is known from a loose and moist habit of body.

The Prognostic.
It is not dangerous, but troublesome, and hinders conception.

The Cure.
I^ they come too soon from hurt in the faculty provoked by too much plethory.
Let blood, use a spare diet, and much exercise. If it be from sharp blood,
temper it by good diet and Medicines, as in the choleri^k distemper of the womb.

Use Baths of Iron-water, that corrects the distempers of the bowels, then
evacuate.

If it come from the retentive faculty, and looseness of the vessels, correct
the cold and moist distem^er with gentle astringents.

I^ it be from a stroke or fall, cu^e it as the vessels opened are cured, of
which before.

Chap. 10. Of Terms that come after their usual time.
When they stay longer then ordinary, and return without order at no set time:
the causes are little and thick blood, straitness of the passages, weakness of
the expulsive faculty, and dullness. Either of these causes may stop the Terms,
bu^ if all meet, the disease is worse

For if blood be not bred in such a quantity, that it may prick Nature forward
to expel it, the purging of it is di^^ered, till there be enough to stir up
Nature to expel it. If think humors are in the blood, the passages stopped, and
the faculty weak, the Terms mu^t needs be disordered, and the purging of them
differed longer.

If it be from want of blood, she has either lived The Signs.
poor in diet, or exercised too much, and she ^inds no inconvenience by the
want of her Terms. If it be from gross slimy blood, there are signs of
Cacochymy. The weakness of the faculty is known by the cold distemper of the
womb.

It is not so dangerous as stoppage of the terms, The Prognostic.
but it is bad enough in a plethorick or cacochymical body.

If little blood be, use a ^uller diet, and exercise The Cure.
not. If blood be gross and foul, make it thin, and cut it, and after
Preparatives, let the humors mixed therewith, be evacuated. It is good to purge
presently after the Terms, and to use Calamints, and to purge often.

Also four or five days before the Terms, sca^i^^e the ankles, and hold the
feet in warm wa^^^, ^ub the legs, apply Cupp^ng-glasses without S^^^ification
to the inside of the thighs, and use Fumes and Pessaries.

Anoin^ the bottom of the belly with things to provoke the Terms. If there be a
numness, use things against the Palsy.

Chap. 11. Of the Terms voided another way.
SOmetimes they come out at the nose, or are vomited up, or flow out by the
Haemorrhoid 1. De morb. mul. 5. apho. 32. obser. medic. c. 15. Lib. 1 de
affect. mulc. 7.
veins. Hence Hippocrates says that a woman that vomits blood, is cured by
having her t^rms, or by a bloody flux. Sometimes they are pissed ^orth.
Dodon^eus says that they come out at the eyes like tears sometimes. Ama^us
Lusitanus says they will come forth at the Teats of the breasts, and at the
navel, at the little finger, or ring-^inger every month, as Mercat^s observed
thrice.

The Causes
Are stoppage of the Terms from straitness of the vessels in the womb, or evil
conformation of the womb.

The Prognostic.
It is more troublesome then dangerous, and hinders conception. It is best when
they come out at the nose, for it is a part that Nature uses to disburden her
self by.

The Cure.
First, bring the blood to the womb again, and abate it. Open the ankle-vein
three days before she begins to bleed. Or cup the thighs, or rub them. Or use
Baths, Fomentations, Ointments, Womb-clysters, Pessaries, and the like
mentioned in Suppression of the Terms.

Chap. 12. Of the Whites.
IT is a ^oul excretion from the womb, white, and sometimes blew, or green, or
reddish, no: at a set time, nor every month, but disorderly, longer or shorter.
Before or after the Terms, and when they are stopped. Virgins seldom have this
disease, and women with child have it sometimes.

It differs from the running of the reins; for it is in less quantity, whiter
and thicker, and at a greater distance. It differs from night pollution, which
is only in sleep with imagination of Venery.

The immediate Cause is an excrementitious The Causes
humor, phlegm, choler or melancholy. Sometimes it is like waterish blood. It is
gathered in the whole body, or in the stomach, liver or spleen. For they who
have crudities in the stomach, are subject to this disease. Sometimes the womb
alone is distempered after often mischances, or when the womb is very cold and
moist.

This matter flows through the veins of the womb, or of the neck of it, which
use to carry blood, and Nature abuses them to carry excrements, especially if
they are bred in the womb.

The remote causes are whatsoever does breed ^ad humors; some have it after
strong purges, or long bathing.

Sometimes they are pale, sometimes blew, red, The Differences.
waterish and green: sometimes slimy, or cold, or sharp, or stinking. In young
people it is reddish.

The face is discolored, the urin thick, there The Signs.
is loathing and heartach. If the humor be sharp and corrupt, there is a
Fever. If it be phlegmatic and much, the ligaments of the womb are loose, and
it falls out, thus Hippocrates, and there Lib. de nature. mulierum.
are says he swelled eyes, evil color, and short breathing.

If it be not bred in the womb, the humor is from a Cacochymy. If it be from a
fault in another part, the signs of that will appear If it come only from the
womb, there will be but little: if from the whole body, there will be more.

The Prognostic.
It is often, long with little inconvenience, b^^ it must be looked to, lest it
be worse, for it o^^^^ brings ulcers, Cachexy, falling out of the wom^,
Consumption, Fainting, Convulsions, when the matter is sent to the brain or
nerves. And the worse the humor is, the greater is the disease.

The Cure.
It must not be suddenly stopped, lest it go to the noble parts.

First, see whether it be from the whole body, or any part, or from the womb it
self. If from the whole body, which is often, make general evacuation, and turn
the humors from the womo, and keep a good diet, lest they come again.

I allow not bleeding in the arm, if the Terms be stopped; for they cause a
Cacochymy, which admits no bleeding. Moreover the mass of blood may be made
^oul by them; therefore find o^^ whether it comes from Cacochymy or Plethory.
And when it is most like to come from Cacochymy, bleed not.

Therefore if phlegm abound, which is mo^^ usual, after general purging, consume
the relique^ with Guajacum and Sar^a, and a drying diet, and by provoking urin,
of which hereafter.

If sharp and choleric humors abound, temper them with gentle astringents, as
Succory, Endive, Sorrel, to prepare, purge with Rhubat^, Triphera Per^ica,
aggregative Pills, and Pills (...) Rhubarb. If it be melancholy, do as in
melancholy.

If it be water, cure it as Galen did the Wife o^ Boeth^s c. 8. ^ib. de
prognost. ad P^sth.

If it be in the stomach, liver, or the like, prevent it from increase, and
because it is most about the stomach, give a Vomit, but not too strong. Then
strengthen the stomach with h^^ and dry Medicines. If choler abound, the
distemper is hot, and then cool it.

If it come from the womb, do as I showed, from what cause soever it is: Baths
are good to ^^acuate and divert, and strengthen, and take away a moist
distemper, provided they are proper for the constitution.

Use Dryers and Astringents. As, Take Cons^r^e of red Roses four ounces, of
Succory two ounces, r^d Coral, Snakeweed, Tormentil roots, Ivory, each (...)
drams^ with Syrup of Mirtles make an Ele^^uary.

Or, Take red Coral, Bole, sealed Earth, each an ^unce; Pearl prepared a
s^ruple, Mastich half a dram, Cypress roots two scruples, Mace half a scriple,
with Sugar of Roses as much as all, make a Powder. Or, Take Diarr^odon a dram,
Sander^ a ^cr^ple, C^ri'ander two drams, Mastich, Coral, each a dram; with
Sugar make Troches.

But use not these Astringents, till the body ^e purged, least the waterish
humors be stopped, and the belly swel: but you may use hot Dryers safe^y, as
Trea^le, Mithridate, with Con^erve of Ro^es and Wormwood.

As, Take Conserve of Rosemary flowers an ounce, Diacorus two drams,
Diarrhodon, Aroma^icum r^^a^um, each a dram; red Coral prepared a dram and
^alf, Treacle two drams, with Syrup of Citron peels ^nal e an Electuary.

And least the womb be hurt with evil humors, ^nject the D^coction of Barley,
Honey of Roses and Whey, with Syrup of dried Roses. Or of ^ormwood, Mints,
Motherwort, red Roses, Al^^m. And then use a Fu^e of Fra^kincense, ^^bdanum,
Mastich, Sanders, Nutmeg, red Roses.

Avoid crude and moist things, and fish, mil^ and all sweet meats, and ^alt.
Forbear Suppe^^ drink red Wine; sleep and wake moderately (...) not upon the
back, least the loins be heated, an^ the humors sent to the womb.

Question Whether are Diuretics good in the Whites?
Diuretics that provoke urin do also provok^ the terms; therefore the relics
of the humo^s would be carried by them to the womb, but these move the terms
secondarily: but if the body be well purged, first they will not make the flux
greater, but bring it out by urin.

Chap. 13. Of a Gonorrhaea.
THe running of the Reins may be in all women that are fit for a man, for it is
the flux of natural seed. It is in men and women from the French pox, but when
stinking humors do flow, it is not properly called a Gonorrhaea.

The Causes
The chief Cause is the weakness of the retentive faculty, and the looseness and
largeness of the seed-vessels: the causes of these are showed in the Gonorrhaea
of men.

The Signs.
The women will declare it, and the greatness and the color; for if it be
white and little and thick, and at distance, it is a true Gonorrhaea.

The Prognostic.
If it continue, it brings a Consumption and barrenness.

The Cure.
The Cure of Gonorrhaea and night pollution is P^act. 3. but I shall add this,
if it come from plenty of seed. The Buds of the Salix o^ Willow, (...) (...)
called the Closing of the Womb. (...) famous Physicians and Anatomists say
(...) is a Hymen, which is the sign of Virginity. (...) they say a membrane
wrinkled with (...) like Mi^tleberries, like the bud of a Rose half (...) hence
came the word (...)

I think with the Ancients, that (...) is something in these parts that
distinguis^^^n Virgins from women, which is violated in the fi^^^ copul^tion:
many say they have it: and we may believe them. For it is certain that ^h^re is
an alteration at first in Vi^gins which causes pain, and bleeding which is a
sign of Virginity.

But what this is, it is not yet known ma^i^^^^ly. Some say it is a nervous
membrane, with small veins, which bleed at the first bout. Some say there are
^our Caruncles tied together with small membranes. Some have observed a fleshy
Circle about the Nymphae with obscure little veins, which makes the membrane
not to be nervous but fleshy.

To be short. I suppose it to be certain, that the part which receives the
Yard, is not in them that have used a man, as in Virgins, nor is it alike in
all; and this has caused the diversity of opinions in Anatomists. Moreover
this is not found in all Virgins, because some are very lustful^ and when it
itcheth, they put in their finger, o^ some other thing, and break the membrane:
so^times the Midwives break it.

Question 2. Whether do all Virgins at the first bout, or Copulation, bleed?
The Africans had a custom to shut the Bride Ex Leone Africano.
groom and the Bride up in a Chamber, after they were married, till they
prepared the Weddingdinner. And an old woman stood at the door, to receive a
bloody sheet from the Bridegroom, that she might show it in triumph to all the
guess, and that then they might ^east with joy. And if there was no blood to be
seen, the Bride was to be sent home ^o her friends with disgrace, and the guess
went ^adly home without their Dinners.

Some say from experience, that some honest Virgins have lost their
Maiden-heads without bleeding, and that it is a certain sign of Virginity when
they bleed, and when they do not, they ar^ not to be censured as unchaste. I
hold that young Virgins will bleed but when they are in years, by reason of the
long continuance of the terms, the parts are harder and larger; and if the man's
Yard be small, there is no necessity of bleeding. Or if the girl was wanton
asore, and by long handling, has dilated the part, or broke it, there is no
blood after copulation. Therefore Deuteronomy. chap 22. the Law of Moses is taken for
that which happens often, and for the most part. And there can be no more
ga^hered from hence, but bleeding is an undoubted sign of Virginity. The same
may be said of the African custom.

Question 3. Whether is the straitness of the privi^ies a sign of Virginity?
The privities are straiter in some according t^ age, habit of body, and other
circumstances, and Virgins are straiter then women that have been at it. But I
deny that straitness is a certain argument of Virginity. For after many acts of
Venery, it may be made so strait by astringent Medicines^ that Whores may be
taken for Virgins; as we showed concerning a Wench that was married, and to
appear a Virgin, she used a Bath of Com^rey roots.

Question 4 Wh^^her is Mi^k i^ the breasts a sig^ o^ Virginity lost?
Some say that there can be no milk in the b^easts, ti^l a woman has
conceived: and Virgins have neither the cause nor the end why milk is made. And
the terms sto^t do rather co^rupt then turn to milk. And though there be
always in the breasts a faculty to make milk, yet does it not show its power,
but upon an object, and for some end.

Some say that Virgins may have milk, and 5. Ap^or. 39^ Gal. in com.
urge this Saying of Hippo^ra^es, If any have milk when she is neither with
child nor breeding^ their ^erms are stopped. Galen is of the same opinion, and
Lib. 3. anat c. 4^ (...) aphor^^^ ib. 5. 39
though it be seldom, ^et he says it is possible And Alexander Benedictus and
Christopher de Vega saw it.

We shall not contradict Hippocrates and expe^ience, but there is a two^old
milk. The one of Virgins. The other of those that have brought forth or
conceived. The first is made of blood, that cannot get out at the womb, but
goes to the breasts; and this is nothing but a superfluous nourishment of the
breasts, that turns milk by ^he faculty of the breasts, without the company ^f
a man or conc^p^ion. The other is only when ^here is a child: of this milk it
is true what Hip^^^rates Cit. lo. de more. mu^^er.
writes, It is a certain sign of a Mole, when ^r^at b^ll^^d women have no milk
in their breasts. and true milk in the breasts is a sign of a live ^hild in the
womb.

These milks differ in respect of the blood, and diversity of the veins that
bring it to the breasts, and though both are white, yet that of Virgins is
thinnest, no^ is it so much, nor so sweet; this 1. De hist. any. c. 12.
may breed in the veins according to Aristotle, from the supers^uous
nourishment of the breasts: and if Virgins have it, they are not to be termed
^nchast.

Chap. 2. Of the Green Sickness, or white Fever.
THis is in Virgins fit for a man, it is called the Virgins disease, and the
white Fever, not that there is always a fever, but because their face is
like people in a fever. It is thus defined.

The Virgins disea^e, is the changing of the natural color into a pale and
green with faintness, heaviness of body, loathing of meat, palpitation of
heart, difficult breathing, sadness swelling of the ^eet, eyelids and face,
from depraved nourishment.

The Causes
The first Cause is stoppage of terms. The next is the gathering of bad humors;
for when the way to the womb is stopped, the blood returns to the great vessels
and bowels, and choaks their heat, and stops the vessels, and spoils the making
of blood, and then there are crudities, which being brought to the habit of the
body, cannot b^ united perfectly to the parts^ and cause a Cach^xy, which is
the way to a Dropsy and Leu^ophlegmac^, and diverse Symptoms. The caus^^ of the
o^structions of the vessels of the womb, are crude humors, and ^legmatick ^limy
blood^ from evil diet, and drinking o^ vinegar, or eating raw corn, chalk,
ashes, lime, earth, ^lay, and the like.

There is a pale and green color, the face is The Signs.
s^ollen, and the eyebrows in the morning after sleep especially; the ankles
swell, and the whole body is loose, and moist from much water: the l^ggs are
lazy, the pulse is little and often, in the neck, temples and back. The heart
beats, the breath is short when they go up stairs, they loath meat. Some have
the Pica, or desire to eat absurd things. The terms are stopped, the Hypocho^dria
are swollen; sometimes they vomit, if vapors ^^ie to the head, there is thirst
and headache; and if melancholy be mixed, the animal actions are hurt.

These are not all in all people, but most are in most, and in some all.

It is often turned to a Dropsy. Some after The Prognostic.
death have had a Scirrhus, hard liver: some die suddenly, the heart being
oppressed. If the stomach be much afflicted, it is dangerous, and they loath
meat much. If it come from the womb alone, it is easier cured.

It is best to begin in the Spring or Summer: The C^re.
after a Clyster, open a vein the ankle.

Then heat the thick cold humor, and make it thin; and^because it is too much
to be purged at once, prepare and purge often, and mix atten^aters and cutters
with your purges.

When the humors are above the stomach and Mesentery, it is good to vomit those
that can easily vomit, and to give liver-physick, or spleen, or womb-physick,
even as in Leucophlegmacy, ^ee the Chapter of Terms stopped. But in this disease,
always consider the liver, spleen and Mesent^ry, the obstructions of which are
cu^ed with things mentioned.

At fir^^ open the the obstructions of these pa^^s wi^h ^om^ ^ew things that
provoke terms, and ^^ter ^ive more.

Thus: Take opening Roots an ounce, Madd^r, (...) Orris, E^^^ampane, Citron
p^els dried, Sar^^^ ^^^h h^lf an ^un^e; Mugwort, Agrimony, ^^rm^nder, each a
handful; Savin two pugils, C^r^ham^s seeds an ounce, Senna two ounces,
Me^hoacan, Agarick, each half an ounce; St^^chas (...) two pugils, Fennel,
Aniseed, Galangal, each two drams; b^^l them to a pint and half, sweeten it,
and ad^ Cinnamon water three dram^. Or infuse ^^em all with Sea-wormwood half a
handful, common ^^^mwood two pugils. Or, Take Agarick, pills of R^uba^^, ea^h a
dram; Quercet^n's Pills of Tartar and of Amm^niacum^ each half a dram; Spike a
s^ruple, Oil of ^innamon th^ee drops, Extract of Wormwood half a scruple, make
Pills: give a scruple an hour before meat. Or, Take juice of M^rcury, clarified
Honey or Sugar, each an ounce: add Gith seed, Senna, ^a^h two drams; Mechoacan
a dram, make a Mass: or give Conserve of Marigold flowers.

St^el is an excellent remedy after Preparatives, with proper Drinks or
Ingredients. And i^ the vessels of the stomach are stopped, give a Vomit, and
then gross powder of Steel.

If the Mesentery be stopped, Take Diarrhodon, Ho^ laudat Mercatus.
Diacurcuma, Agarick, each a dram; C^rthamus seeds two drams, red Dock roots,
C^rrot seed, each (...) dram and half; Cloves a dram, Steel prepared two
ounces, with clarified Honey make an El^ctuary: give two or four drams. If she
vomit, stop it not.

If the Liv^r be chiefly sto^t^ let the St^^l be ^inely poudere^. And Take of
it half a pound, add eight ounces of Wine in a glass, set it in the embers,
stir it, and let it boil twelve simmers, t^l you see it ^roath, and grow a
little thick; then pour the ^roath and all into another vessel: do thus four
times, and then let it be gently boiled till it be thick as Honey. Then Take
Parsley, Carrot seed, Diacurcuma, Diarr^odon, each a dram and half; Cinnamon a
dram, Steel so prepared six drams, with Honey make an Electuary: give three
drams, or five after exer^ise.

If the Spleen be stopped; Take Steel prepared a pound, wash it with Vine^ar,
then strain it, and lay it on a clout, and add powder of Cloves h^lf an ounce.
Let them st^nd so a day and a night, then put them in a glassed vessel, ad ten
ounces of white Wine^ Diarrhodon, Hearts tongue, Senna, and Capar ba^ks^ then
stir them, then set them in the Sun for a day, or in an Oven: do this ten
days, til the Steel be melted in the Wine, and little or nothing at the
bottom. Give two ounces of this in the morning after purging and exercise.

Or, Take Steel prepared an ounce, Cinnamon, Aniseeds, each two drams;
Diamos^hu without musk a dram Sugar an ounce, make a Powder, give a dram: drink
white ^ine and Mugwort water aft^r it.

Ste^led Wine. Take Steel in poud^r three ounces, Cinnamon half an ounce, white
Wine three pints: set them in a close glass eight d^ies in the Sun, stir them

twenty d^ies, and walk after it.

At first give a Steel-medicine to pr^pare. As, Take Steel filings four ounces,

H^ps, Grass, M^dder, Borage, or Spring Water: st^^in it, and do so ^^ven tim^s.
Then Take so many ounces o^ ^^w Steel, and cast it into water as before: strain
and add Syrup of Violets, Borage, or (...) of R^ses four ounces: give three

Steel is bent Spring and Fall, purge, and exercise before and after it, that
it may be better dispersed. Use Preparatives, Purges, and strengtheners often,
and for a long time, and change the forms, least the patient loath them.

If water spread about the body, cool the body, and make it heavy. Use Sweats,
as Baths natural or artificial, of Mugwort, Calamints, Nep, Danewort, Sage,
Bays, Rosemary, Mercury, Ivy, Briony roots, Orris, Elicampa^e.

After pu^ging and opening obstructions, all the Sympto^^s will vanish, if not,
see for the Symptoms of the womb.

The Diet.
Let the air be temperately hot. The meat of good juy^e and easy digestion;
pot herbs and green f^^its must be avoided, fish, milk, lettice. Make S^u^e
with Sage and Cinnamon. Drink Wine; let bread ^e well leavened, with
^ennels^^d^ drink no wat^^ no^ Broaths, at first and in the de^li^^tion of the
disease, use exercise and V^n^ry. Let sleep be moderate.

Question 1. Whether may the woman in this Disease be allowed the absurd things
they long for?
They are Virgins or women with child that long for such things, Virgins must
not be allowed them, as chalk, etc. for they will increase the disease.

Women with child must be pleased with fair wo^ds^ to abstain from them; but if
the appetite will not be allayed, rather grant them, then suffer an abortion or
mark upon the child.

Question 2. Is motion and exercise good in the Green Sickness?
They are better then idleness which heaps up crudities, they raise the
languishing heat in the bowels, and help the nourishment to be distributed:
therefore they are to be used before the disease be great, and in the
declination they discuss the humors.

But use moderation, least you weaken the body, or choke them First therefore
use Frictions, then watching, then more exercise after convenient purging.

Question 3. Whether is Venery good for Maids in the Green Sickness?
It is probable, and agreeable to reason and experience that Venery is good
Hippocrates Hippocr. lib. de morb virg.
bids them presently marry, for if they conceive they are cured. John Langius
^aith this disease comes in the ripeness of age or presently after. Lib. 1.
epist.
Venery heats the womb and the parts adjacent, opens and loosens the passages,
so that the terms may better flow to the womb.

But if there be a great Cacochymy, take that away before she be married, and
then Venery may do more then Physic. But use it not in the vigor of the
disease, nor in weakness.

Question 4. Whether is Blood-letting good in this Disease?
A Cachexy beginning with coldness of the whole body, seem to deny bleeding,
and because the crude humors are in fault rather then blood. Lib. de morb. virg.
But Hippocrates advises bleeding at the first.

If it be a new disease, and comes from stopped terms, and blood abound that is
stopped, and not turned into another humor, you may boldly bleed, provided the
strength permit, and the passages be open. But in an old disease when crude
phlegm abounds, bleed not, for it will increase the disease.

Chap. 3. Of Symptoms from the Womb, and Mother-fits in General.
IT is not to be expressed what miserable diseases women are subject to: both
Virgins and others from the womb, and its consent with other parts. For when
terms or blood are stopped, there are great Symptoms, and while they putrefie or
get evil qualities* the Symptoms are grievous, and almost unexpressible.

One woman may have diverse Symptoms from the womb at the same time, when the
seed and terms are mixed with other humors after they are corrupted, and there
is more sometimes, and such noble substance as seed and terms being corrupted,
are like poison. Gal. 6. de lo. aff. c. 5.


The consent with other parts, is from likeness of parts, nearness, or
connection of vessels. And because the womb is membranous, it has a great
consent with the membranes and nerves. Also the parts adjacent are easily
infected. And thirdly, it has consent with all the body by veins, arte^ies and
nerves.

It consents with the brain by the nerves, and membranes of the back-marrow: it
cons^nts with the heart by the ar^eries, with the liver by the veins, which are
great in the womb, and therefore the blood and bad humors go back to the ^^ver.
It consents with the stomach by Anastomosis in the veins of the Mesentery, and
by the arteries through foul humors and vapors go from the womb to the
Mesentery and stomach.

It con^ents with the spleen by the arteries; therefore many women that had not
their terms enough in their youth, and have hot blood, are after
Hypochondriack, and a Physician can scarce distinguish these diseases of the
womb and spleen nor cure them severally.

It consents with the papps by veins and ner^es, and the heart, Diaghragma,
head, brain, and all the org^ns of sense and motion; with the liver, spleen,
stomach, belly, mesentery, bladder, strait ^ut, back, hips, arms and legs, and
causes sym^toms. As Galen ^aith the mother or hysterical Gal. de lo. aff. c. 5.
^^^^ion is one name, but has under it innume^^ble Symptoms.

Chap. 4. Of Suffocation of the Womb.
IN this they seem to be strangled. And there are so many Symptoms at once,
that it is impossible to define it by one. Sometimes there is only short
breath, sometimes the animal actions are hurt, the whole body is cold from a
malignant vapor sent up from the womb.

The Causes
The immediate Cause, is a vapor malignant and venomous, sent up by the
arteries, veins and nerves that hurt the actions of the parts it goes to. This
vapor is like air or wind, thin and little but very strong, to get presently
through the whole body; it chie^ly ascends to the gullet, and causes choking,
as eating of Mushrooms, Hellebore, and other poisons. There is often short
difficult breathing, with heart-ach, vomiting, and loathing. If the vapor go
first to the heart, the motion of it cease, and there is swounding, and she
falls down. If it go to the brain, the animal actions are hurt.

When ^eed and terms corrupt in the womb, with other bad humors, they breed
this evil vapor; because they are the best substance, and the beginning of
generation, they are worst when corrupted, especially seed to hurt the whole
Gal. cit. 1.
body.

Sometimes it is in women with child, when they have not their after pu^ging,
but evil humors a^e le^t, and corrupt in the womb.

The chief cause of this humor, is in the trumpet of the womb and stones, the
body of which is hollow and loose, the stones being in bladders, and have
hollowness full of water, which in hyst^rical women is yellow and thicker then
ordinary. Vesal. de corp. huma. Fabr. lib. 5. c. 15.
This trumpet and the stones are often taken for the womb it self when they
are swollen with corrupt seed, and humors, and wind, and reach to the navel: of
which in the Chapter of ascent of the Womb.

This disease is breeding sooner or longer, as the matter is more or less,
sometimes corrupt humo^s lie still, and if they be stirred, they send a venom or
vapor to the whole body: now in women subject to this disease, sweet s^ents to
the nose, or taken in, or anger will move these huhumors and vapors.

They are according to the variety of the symptoms The Differences.
and efficient cause, or venomous humors, for corrupt blood, especially seed,
puts on another Nature.

That Suffocation is at hand, it appears by laziness, The Signs.
weakness of the legs, paleness, sad countenance, and the motion of something
like a ball in the belly, with noise like Froggs, Snakes, or Crows, so that
some think it devilish. There is also belching, yawning, yexing, short wind,
heartbeating, loathing, dullness, laughture at the coming of the fit, from the
vapor g^tting into the membr^ne of the breast, that tickle them: some cry, some
both laugh and cry.

These Symptoms increase when the fit comes and the jaws are closed, that she
seems to be choked, and sense and motion is gone or depraved. Some have
Convulsions, some h^ar what is done about them, but cannot speak, the ^ul^e i^
less, the whole body is cold, and the eyes (...) as if they were dead.

When the ^it declines, humors s^ow from the ^riv^^i^s, the gu^s rumble, the
eyes open, the cheeks grow red, and the body warm, the animal actions return,
and the patient sighs, and comes to her self.

It is known to be from corrupt seed, if the terms are in order, and short
breath, and low voice, Suffocation and Convulsions, and all Symptoms are then
more vehement, and at the end of the fit there flows a humor like seed out of
the privities. It is from the terms if they be stopped, or flow not orderly, and
if there be a dis^ase in the womb, it is neither from the seed no^ the terms.

The Prognostic.
1. If there come swounding, or a great Convulsion, or quenching of natural
heat, it is deadly.

2. Suffocation from corrupt seed, is more dangerous then that which is from
the terms mixed with melancholic humors.

3. The longer it lasts, and the worse the symptoms, the more is the danger. It
cease in young women when they begin to bear children.

4. The oftener the fit comes, the more you may ^ear the quenching of the
natural heat by weakening of the heart often, and if she foam at the mouth, she
dies.

The Cure of the Fit.
In the fit you must discuss the malignant vapors that rises from the womb,
and turn it from the principal parts, and you must evacuate the matter that
breeds it, and prevent its return. Call upon her loud, pluck the hairs of her
privities and ears, make strong Ligatures and Frictions, cup the legs, and
thighs, and g^oyns; hold stinks to the nose, as Partridg-feathers, burnt hairs,
Leather, Horn, Castor, Assa foetida, Galbanum, oil of Amber, Rue, the warts on
Horses legs dried, and the powder upon coals burnt, makes a ^ume which if taken
in the nose, suddenly raised them.

Apply sweet Scen^s to the privi^ies, as Cive^, Musk, Gallia, and Al^pta
mos^hata, or powder of Cloves. To be a skilful Physician study my Sennertus,
Platerus, Riverius, Bartholinus, and Riolanus, of the last Editions.


Or, Take Storax calamita, Benzoin, each a dram; Gallia moschata half a
s^ruple, make Tro^hes with Gum Tr^ganth, and let the Fume be taken into the
womb by a Funnel.

A Liniment. Take Storax, Benzoin, each a dram; Gallia moschata half a scruple,
Civet four grains, liquid Storax half a scruple, with Cotton put it into the
womb.

Clysters to discuss wind, draw down the matter. Take the Carminative D^coction
a pint, Electuary of Hiera six drams, Benedicta laxativa an ^^^ce, Oil of Rue
and Bayberri^s, each a dram. Use Womb-clysters and Pessaries to women that have
known man. Take Electuary of Hiera and Diaphaenicon, each two drams; Turpentine
half an ounce, Honey of Mercury an ^unce, Castor hal^ a dram, ^^th Wool make a
Pessary.

Oil of Tin applied to the navel, does remove the sit.

Or Rue, Castor, and sneesing Pouders. As, Take white Hellebore hal^ a scruple,
long Pepper and Ginger, each half a dram: or put Oil of Am^^^ into the Nose and
E^rs.

Apply to the Womb this. Take Oil of Rue, ^a^s, each two oun^^s; Cummin seed,
C^st^r dissol^^^ in Vin^gar, e^ch two drams; with Wax make a (...) Or use a
^l^^s^^r of ^^lb^num, Ca^or, and A^^a foetida.

A compound distilled Water. Take Zedoary, ^^smp s^^ds, Lovage ^^^ts, each two
oun^^s; Mirrh, Castor, each half an o^nce; Piony roots four oun^^^, Misteto of
the Oak gathered in the wain of the Mo^n three ounces, ad water of Motherwort
four pin^s an^ half, Spirit of Wine a pint and half, steep them eig^^ days,
distill and give a spoonful with Tile-flower, or Mugwort water, or Oil of Amber
some drops. Or, Take Castor, Mirrh, Assa faetida, each a s^rupl^^ Pepper half a
scruple, with syrup of Mugwort m^l^ Pills, give three.

The Cure out of the Fit.
First, prevent the ^eed from corrupting in the womb, and if it be corrupt,
evacuate it presen^^y with Womb-clysters and Pessaries: then dispe^se the
relics, and strengthen the wom^. But ^ir^^ give a general Purge that is
gentle often, and use things that prevent the breeding of seed.

Strengthen with Plasters and Ointments to the region of the womb. As, Take
liquid Storax two drams, Avens, Agnus castus seeds, Angelica, each half a dram;
Alipta moschata a scruple, Oil of Nard, Lillies, and white Wax, make a^
Ointment. Or, Take Seeds of Agnus castus ^ dram, all Sanders, each half a dram;
whit^ Ros^ powder a dram, Tacamahaca a scruple, Amber t^^ scruples, Alipta
moschata half an o^nce, with Turpentine, Labdanum and Wax, make a Plaster. I^
she be a Virgin, let her be married.

If it be from terms stopped, see in the Chapt^^ of that.

This disease is neither from seed, nor blood^ nor humors, if they be not
corrupted after a peculiar manner. If it be from the womb diste^pered, give the
In^usion of an ounce of Brion^ root in white Wine on^e in a week, for a year
(...) bed time: or this Hyste^i^k Water.

Take Lovage roots, Piony, Angelica, Zedoar^, each an ounce; Mis^eto of the Oak
gathered in the wane of the Moon two ounces, Mints, Balm, Calamints, Bettony,
each a handful; Carrot, Parsnep s^^d, Castor, each half an ounce; distill them
in white Wine and water of Motherwort after eight days infuson. Or, Take
Briony, Valerian, Spignel, Ang^lica roots, each half an ounce; Balm, Ca^amints,
Pennyroyal^ ^ettony, each half a handful; boil them in Wine, add Syrup of
Mugwort an ounce: give it a^ thrice.

Vitriol of Iron one grain, with two grains of Sugar given in Wine some weeks,
is excellent.

Or, Take Cummin seed, wild Parsnep seed, each ^ dram; give a dram in powder.
Or^ Take Fae^^la Brioniae two drams, Cummin seed, Parsnep s^ed, ^^ch a dram;
Amber half a dram, Cloves two s^ru^les, Cinnamon a scruple, make a Powder.

Pills. Take Castor a scruple, Assa faetida half ^ scruple, Mirrh, Galbanum,
Sagapenum; each a ^cruple; with Honey of Mercury make ^ills: take (...) a
s^^^ple or a scruple often. Or take Treac^e (...) ^^^hridate.

Apply Plasters or Lin^ments to the region of (...) Womb, thus. Take old
Treacle half an ounce, Agnu^ castus seeds a dram, Oil of Angelica and ^ummin
seeds, each two drams; with Plaster of ^^yberri^s. ^r make Ointments of the
same.

Quest^^^ 1. What preterna^ural diseases is the (...) of the Womb properly?
^^me say it is a cold distemper in quality chan^, they say right, but coldness
is not the chief ^^^^om. Others say it is respiration hurt, Syn^^^ or
Convulsion. But it cannon be defined by one Symptom. For sometimes the animal
actions are hurt, and there is a Megrim, Delirium, Convulsion, and sense and
motion are gone.

Nor is it strange, that so small a vapor should bring such Symptoms, for it
has an occult venom Gal. 6. de lo. aff. c. 5.
in it^ which is strong, for it goes many ways, and to many parts.

Question 2. What is the true Caus^ of the (...) of the Mother?
I say it is the malignant vapors that fly up from the womb: for it does not
work by a manifest 4. De lo. aff. c. ^.
quality, but by a venom which Galen sait^ is like that of a Torpedo, or
Phalanx, or Scorpion, which are little in bulk, but do great mi^chief, being
enemies to the vital spirits and hea^ by which there is a coldness all over,
and s^o^ breath from the actions of the heart hurt. For when the heart is hurt,
or the vital Spirits, either suffocated or corrupted, there are no good animal
Spirits bred, and they not flowing to the nerves and muscles, hinder the motion
of the breast. Also this malignant vapor is an enemy (...) the animal Spirits,
and makes doting and Co^vulsions when it gets to the brain.

The Cause of these vapors are corrupt se^ and terms, for while they are in
their proper vesels, they change not their nature. And the se^ is not always
pure but mixed with (...) hum^^ and the seed-vessels are sometimes (...) a^
distempered. Moreover the corruption (...) the womb in a p^culiar manner: for
as F^rr^^ says, The place from whence com^^ life, is (...) the breeder of the
most deadly poison.

Question 3. Is it good to give Wine in a ^it of the Mother?
Hippocrat^^ and Avicen quarrel about this. ^. (...)
The first allo^s wine because they are weak, and nothing sooner re^resheth^
But Avicen is for water, and forbids flesh, for they increase seed and blood.

But in the time of the ^it wine is proper, and Avicen does not speak of the
^it, but of the diet out of the ^it, when it comes from plenty of seed and
blood; nor will a little wine in the time of ^^e ^it get presently to the womb.

Chap. 5. Of the Frenzy of the Womb.
IT is a great and foul Symptom of the womb^ both in Virgins and Widows, and
such as ^ave known man. These are mad for lust, and in^i^e men, and lie down to
them, and it differs from Salacity, because in that there is no Deli^ium.

It is an immoderate desire of Venery that ^akes women almost mad, or a
Delirium from ^n iminoderate desire of Venery: it is without a ^e^ve^, and with
heat, and tends to madness. ^here are degrees in it, for modest women have
(...) but will not for shame declare it, and die of ^onsumptions. Others will
not conceal it, but ^eak their thoughts bawdily, and follow men, and ^olli^i^e
them shamelesly, as Hippocrates (...) in his Book of Virgins Diseases.

The immediate Cause is plenty of hot and The Causes
sharp seed against Nature, but next unto that which is natural; it is a little
biting, swelling, and ^orcing Nature to let it out by leche^y. The brain is
only hurt by consent^ and the animal actions by an external error, or too
vehement object. The part first affected, is the womb in the Nympha, which
grows hot, and swells, but the Nymphae are not properly the seat of Venery, but
the Clitoris, which was called by the same name anciently.

The heat and sharpness of seed, is from the heat of the womb that breeds it,
from hot humo^^ in the womb and hot blood.

The outward Causes, are hot meats spiced^ strong wine, and the like, that heat
the privities^ idleness, pleasure, and dancing^ and reading o^ bawdy Histories.

The Signs.
They find their lust to boy^ at first, and so^ shame will not declare it: they
are sad and silent, and their eyes turn to and fro with lust, an^ if any speak
of Venety, they blush, and the puls^ changes, when the brain consents,
reason i^ perverted, and modesty is overcome, then the^ prate, are lustful, and
angry; sometimes they cr^ or laugh without a cause: they follow men, an^
solicit them for copulation. Some will lie wi^^ any one they meet.

The Prognostic.
It is a ^ordid disease, curable at first, but if neglected, it turns to
madness.

The Cure.
Let Virgins that have it, before reason is subverted, be in company with chaste
Maid^ns, o^ h^ married. And be let blood to abate heat of blco^ and sharpness
of seed very often, there is no better remedy.

Then temper and evacuate the humors, if the^ be adust, and there be madness^
use strong^^

Then have a Bath of Lettice, Willow, Waterlillies, Vine-leaves, Purslane,
Venus navel, red Roses, Violets, Waterlillies. Let her sit twice ^ day in it,
and not sweat.

To take away the sharpness of the seed, use Lettice, Violets, Waterlillies,
and things that quen^h seed by a secret quality, as Agnus castus ^eed, Leaves
and Flowers of Champhyre here^^^er.

As^ Take leaves of Waterlillies, Agnus castus, Willow, each three handfuls;
Lettice, Purslane, Ve^^^ navel, each a handful; Lettice, Poppy s^ed, the (...)
great cold Seeds, each half an ounce; Dill seed (...) drams, Waterlillies a
handful, Violets half a ^^ndful, beat them with juice of Lemons, distill them
^^er twenty four hour, add to every pint a dram of ^mphire, give an ounce. Or,
Take Agnus ca^^^ieaves, Rue, Willow, each two handfuls; Mints, (...) of Dill,
each a handful and half; Waterlillies ^^lf a handful. Agnus castus seeds, Hemp,
Cori^^der, Lettice seed, each half an ounce: beat them, and distill them with
water, add a pint of juice of Le^^ns, rectifi^ it to half.

An Emulsion. Take Lettice, and white Poppy (...) and the four great cold
Seeds, each half an ounce; (...) of Lettice, Waterlillies, Willow, each four

An Electuary. Take Conserve of Waterlillies, ^^^lets, of Agnus ca^tus top^^
e^^h an ounce; of Ro^^ h^lf an ounce, red C^ral Smaragds, e^ch a dram; (...)
and Lettice candied, each an ounce; with (...) of Violets and Waterlillies,
make an Electuary.

Or make Baths of the same. As, Take tops A^nus castus, Lettice, Rue,
Waterlillies, D^l (...) them, anoint with Oil of Lillies, ^ngu^nt of Rose^,
with Camphire af^^r that. Or lay a Plaster of Mercury and Marsh-lentils to the
breast and loins. L^y a Plate of Lead to the Back, and give a Pessary of juice
of Plantane, P^^slane, Gourds.

These that work by an occult quality, are fittest for numnesses that must not
marry, but they that will marry must forbear them, because they cause
bar^^nness.

Let diet be thin, and of little nourishment, no Eggs; Beef is good, and fresh
fish. Also Lettice, Purslane, Succo^y. Sleep little^ think not of Venery,
labor, and avoid idleness.

Question. Whether is Camphire cold or h^t, or does it quench Venery?
It is hot because it burns, flames, is thin, pie^ceth, is sharp and bitter.
But it has cold effects, as curing of burns and inflammations, and h^^
headaches: but this is from the likeness of the substance, because it draws hot
vapors to it, an^ discusseth, as Linseed oil that cures burns. No^ has it a
double substance cold and hot, that man be separated.

Exercit. 104. s^^. 8.
Scaliger denies it by experience to quench V^nery, but if it be taken often,
it does: he t^ie^ it but once.

Chap. 6. Of the Melancholy o^ Virgins and Widows.
IT is a D^liri^^ with sadness, trouble and we^ ^ing, s^^times laug^ing,

causes trouble of heart and de^^^ium, while this blood is quiet in the

Let her be merry, and prepare and purge melancholy, thus. Take Borage and Balm
water, each three ounces; Syrup of the juice of Borage and Bugloss, each an
ounce and half. Mix them for two Doses, repeat them sometimes. Then purge
Mel^ncholy. As, Take Senna six drams, Agarick a dram and half, Borage flowers

for six hours, strain them, ad Syrup of Violets an ounce. Or, Take Scorzonera

of Cinnamon, make a Syrup: give two or three ounces.

Also give Cordials, Confection of Hyacinths, Species Exhilerants, and
Confection Alkermes to such as can bear it. Cure it as Melancholy, only the
matter comes from the womb; therefore still regard that it dry not the body too
much, but use a moistning Diet.

Chap. 7. Of an Epilepsie from the Womb.
THis Falling Sickness is worst then from other causes, because there are
greater symptoms, for that malignant vapor does not only fall into the nerves,
but the veins and arteries.

The Causes
The same malignant vapor that causes suffocation, causes this, for when it
ascends by the veins or arteries, it begets other diseases: but when it gets to
the nerves, or to the fountain of them, it causes the Epilepsie. In some the
whole body has a Convulsion; in others some part only, as the eyes, head,
tongue^ hand or leg, and the outward senses are diversely taken. Some see not,
some hear not, some see and cannot speak, some dote, and think they see strange
things: some cry out, and know not why. All loose the sense o^ feeling.

If the vapor be not very malignant, they re^u^n to their work after the fit,
as if they had not ^een ill.

It is known by what has been said: for here The Signs.
(...) not only a Convulsion as in other Epilepsies, ^^t dive^s Symptoms as in
Suffocation of the ^omb. They seldom ^oam at the mouth, because ^e brain is not
so shaken as to cause ^oaming: ^or is the vapor so fixed in the roots of the
ner^es, but they often do hear.

It is grievous, and has grievous Sym^toms, The Pr^gnostick.
^ut it is not so bad as a true Epilepsie, and if you ^ve proper Medicines, it
never returns.

There is also a pain in the loins, because bad h^mors go from the veins of the

into the membranes, and stretch them, and cause pain: these humors must have

Chap. 9. Of the Diseases of the Heart, and beating of the Arteries in the Back
and sides from the Womb.
THe heart beats, and the arteries also, as we showed in the Green Sickness,
and it is by ^^il v^pors s^nt by the ^^teries to the heart from the womb, that
a^ise from terms and evil hum^^^ gathered in the womb: and this is known by
^ther Signs and Symptoms of a distempered womb.

The Cure.
To discuss the malignant vapors from the heart, give Cordials as in Chap. 3.
of palpi^^tion of the Heart; as Aqua vitae, Cinnamenwater, and Epithems, Baggs
and Liniments.

The arteries also beat with the heart, as i^ Widows on the lef^ Hypochondrion
and Bac^, where there is a great artery, and the artery th^^ beats in the Back,
is part of the great artery: they which beat in the Hypochondrion are the
lesse^ spleniti^k and mesenterick branches; therefore the beating is mo^e in
the Back then in the Hypochondrion, but both puls^tions come from the same
cause.

The C^us^^
The inflammation of the a^teries is the Cause of this beating, when evil
humors are sent fr^^ the womb i^to the great branches of the arte^^^ and there
b^^t^ the heart being over-hot. Sometimes the motion of this artery is all the
body over, and from a hot humor, the hot humors go to the heart, and cause a
fever, but because there is little putrefaction, it vanishes presently. If
the heat of the humors go to the brain by the arte^ies, there is madness. Some
seek the cause in the v^ins, and say that the arteries suffer from the (...) in

The Causes
This is when malignant vapors, the way bei^^ large, rise from the arteries of

they are hot, they cause thi^st; (...) cold, they hurt concoction, and many

v^pors get into diverse parts of the stomach.

The Signs.
You may know when the stomach is affected by consent from the womb, because
the Symptoms abate and return again, when the vap^^ comes to the stomach: there
are also other signs of the womb distempered, and of the Spleen and Mesentery
by the vessels, of which the matte^ is sent from the womb to the stomach.

The Prognostic.
The Symptoms are worse when they come from the womb, then when they come from
the stomach first, nor are they curable, except the womb be first cured.

The Cure.
It is to be directed to the womb and stomach^ For if it come only by consent,
and there is n^ disease by propriety, when you have cured the womb, the
stomach-disease vanishes of it ^el^, if you do but strengthen the stomach.

THE FOURTH BOOK.
THE FOURTH SECTION.
Of the Symptoms which are in Conception.
Chap. 1. Of the desire of V^nery hurt.
THERE are two Symptome^ in women about copulation. The first l^chery lost,
when (...) does not willingly entertain ^ man, or cannot long endu^e him, or if
she endures, she finds little or no pleasure, no more then if she were
outwardly handled. The other is too great lust as in Frenzy of the womb, when
they cannot be satis^^^^ by many m^^.

The Causes
The defect of ap^etite in lust is f^^m (...) ^eed, or when it is cold, or
there wants (...) the seed-vessels. The causes of want of ^eed (...) lib. 3.
p^r. 9. s^ct. 2. c. 1. Somtim^s it is (...) ^^^l conformation of the

For that see lib. 3. of Barrenness of men, where (...) Liniments and Ointments

the man anoint the head of his yard ^ith Civet, or Hens gall, or the gall of a
Pick^d.

Too much Lechery not of it self hinders con^eption, but wandering lust that
follows lechery does.

The Causes are the same with those of womb ^^enzie, as plenty of seed,
sharpness, and commotion, sharpness of seed from hot meat, and Medicines that
provoke lust, and sharp humors in the womb and seed.

Thus lust or lechery is abated by Medicines that extinguish the plenty of
seed, and allay its s^^rpness.

Chap. 2. Of Barrenness, and want of Conception.
MAn or woman may be lustful, and copulate, and yet there may be no conception,
or (...) may conc^ive too many, as Twins, or more, (...) have one ^onception
after another, which is (...) Su^er^^^t^tion, or (...) conceives a Mole or (...)

Con^eption is of fruitful seed spent by a man, and mi^ed with a woman's s^^d to
per^ection, for (...) making of a child by the retentive and altering faculty
of the womb; hence it is necessary that both seeds be fruitful that is hot, ^ul
of Spirits, and well tempered, and a fit subject for a Soul, and that both
spend at a time, and there be mixed and retained together, to produce a child.

Also the sucking of the womb is necessary, and that it should lay it up and
embrace it, so that there be no space between the seed and the womb. Sometimes
the womb greedily snatcheth and emb^aceth the seed, but does not keep it, bu^
lets it come forth two or three days after, or keeps it to no purpose, and
brings it not to action, as in a false conception or mole. Moreover there must
be blood in readiness to get the child, or be sprinkle it when it is first
^ormed, and to nourish it after.

Therefore if te^ms be wanting as in girls, o^ be stopped, or gone as in old
^olk, expect no conception. If they flow not by reason of labor and too much
exercise, the conception is not hindered, if there be but blood enough to form
the child. Hence it is that women that are brought in bed, conceive again
before they have their terms.

If all these be right, there is conception, otherwise she is barren, which is
an impotency of the womb, that keeps it from sucking in of the seed, or from
retaining, or from nourishing i^, and bringing it into act.

The Causes
The first is impotency in copulation, from the closing of the womb, of which
before: or oth^^ evil conformation of the privities, or and ul^e^, or tumor in
the ne^k of the womb. The second is the breeding of unfruitful seed, from
diste^p: of the vessels and stones, or too tender and delicate a constitution.
In men at eighteen, in women at fourteen, and men seldom get children after
sixty, and women seldom bear them after ^^fty.

As for evil conformation to breed seed, some Faelix Plate. lib. 1. obser. tit.
de vitalis motu^ defect^.
have wanted seed-vessels, or they were not in their places. Some women are
barren by the first Husband, and have children by the second, because there
must be a certain proportion between both seeds: and if they be wanting, they
are barren, which proportion is hard to be explained, and almost impossible;
for we must not stay in the first qualities, for there are occult qualities in
seed, by which they agree or disagree.

The third cause, is when the womb su^ks not in the seed, nor receives it in a
right manner, as when the attractive faculty is hurt, or hindered by diverse
distempers of the womb, or when a woman hates her Husband.

Attraction is hindered by tumors or ulcers in the womb, or by its being
displaced, as Hippocrate^: 5. Ap^^. 46.
They who being too fat, and conceive not, the mouth of their womb is stopped up
with the Cawl, and they conceive not till they are lean. But the more probable
reason of not conceiving, is the matter of the seed turning into fat.

The fourth cause, is the retention of the seed hurt by a moist distemper, then
the womb is weak and the fibers are loose, so that it cannot contract it self
to retain; and the seed by reason of its sliminess, cannot stick there. Also if
the wo^b be too thick, not fleshy and ^o^t, and be not sp^inkled with blood, as
it i^ in some by birth, whi^^ makes them barren, and in some after they ce^se
to conceive.

If the orifice of the womb gape a^^^^ (...) and abo^tion, by which the fibers
are loosned and weakened, and the retention of the seed hur^ And if a woman
after copulation cough, neese, cry out, dance, or be angry or frighted, the
sam^ may be.

The fifth cause of barrenness, is the hurt of the altering faculty, which
brings in the form and act into seed; for if there be not a due proportion
between the womb and the seed, there is barrenness, as seeds are choked in
marsh^^ ground, or die, or are burnt in dry and sand^ ground: so man's seed is
suffocated in a moist 5. Aphor. 52. ^
womb, and dried up in a hot. Hippocrates speaks o^ the (...) proportion of the
womb, as is ^it to cherish this or that seed, thus. Women that h^^e thick and
cold wombs conceive not, and they wh^^ womb is too moist, ^^r they quench the
seed; nor^^ they conceive that have dry and burning wombs, for the seed is
corrupted in them for want of nourishmer^, they who are of a mean temper
between these are f^^^full.

The last cause of barrenness, is want of menstrual blood, which is necessary
for the first formation of the child. Therefore Nurses that have much milk
conceive, because the blood is carried to the breasts.

Therefore all these causes are reduced either to impotency in copulation, or
distemper of the stones and seed-vessels, or evil conformation, or ^ cold and
moist distemper of the womb, which cannot attract, detain, and alter the seed;
sometimes ^ hot and dry distemper that cannot nourish the ^eed^ or from the
enlarging of the orifice after childbea^ing, or from humors, or being
displaced, or the straitness of the vessels, or want (...) term^, or too many.

Hence we may gather, that barrenness is oft^^ from a fault in the women then
the men, for i^ men there is nothing required but fruitful ^^ed spent into a
fruitful womb. But women besides the meeting of their own seed, must receive,
^^i^, and nourish the ma^s; and afford matt^r (...) the forming of the child
(...) which diverse accidents happen, and any of these will cause bar^n^ess.

Mark also in these kinds of causes, that some do not properly cause
barrenness, but only hin^^nder conception for a time; as the closing of the
womb, smalness of the privities, these do not ^^^ply cause barrenness.

Some bring other external causes, as eating Ioa. Anglicus c^pi de steril.
(...) heart of a Deer, or if she wear Jet about her, (...) if Hart's-tongue be
hanged about her bed: if (...) walk over the terms of another, or tread upon
them unawares, or anoint with them, or put (...) jay^e of Mints into her womb.

Some are born so, from a fault in the womb; The Differences.
^^^ers are not simply b^^^en, but in respect of the ^^n, and when they have

be changed: some bring forth at first, and then by some fault g^o^ barren.

H^^ shall we know that a woman is barren? The Signs.

It is hard to find whether the two seeds have the right proportion, or the
womb agree with the man's seed. Yet temperate with temperate are very fruitful,
because they are both of a good constitution. But intemperate couples are
barren; but if one tempe^ be good, it may mend the other, and she may conceive.

If it come from a Medicine that destroys the seed, she will tell. If
enchantment be the cause, though they love, yet they cannot copulate, or
whereas they loved each other, now they fall out without a cause.

Ask the woman how her womb does attract, retain, and cherish the seed: if it
have a tumor, or have matter or not? Whether there be a natural hereditary
imper^ection? Enquire concerning her family, if many were barren, whether she
has had hard travel or abortion? Whether the seed comes away presently after,
or at a distance, after some days; if so, then the woman's ^eed is unfruitful,
or there is a distemper in the womb that keeps it from cherishing the seed.

If the terms be wanting^ they are Viragoes, and have hair on their chins, or
they are ^at, and seed turns into fat, or they are very lean because 5. Aphor.

they want blood.

Hippocrates proves Barrenness thus. Put ^ Fume (says he) under the Coats of a

A woman that mar^^es too young, after she has once conceived, and then

Chap. 4. Of Conception, and forming of the Child.
COnception is an action of the womb, after fruitful seed both male and female
is received, mixed and nourished, and its strength is stirred up to do its
office. Seed and Coema differ, seed is that which comes from both male and
female, but Coema is that which is mixed of both, and is called Conception
which produces a child.

This Conception is presently when two seeds meet in the womb, in less then
seven hours after they are spent, if the heat of the womb preserve them, for
Nature is not idle a moment, but presently falls to conformation. Therefore
Hippocrates Lib. de genit.
^aith that the beginning of Conception is to be reckoned from the day that the
seed is retained, and if she conceives not from the weakness of the seeds or
womb, the seed will fall out in seven days for Hippocrates ^aith, That
Conception and aborti^n Lib. de s^ptim. parti^.
are judged in the same time, as a disease, health, and death are judged. And
Arist^tle ^aith, ^f seed r^mains within till the seventh day, there is certain
3. De hist. any. ^. 3.
Conc^ption.

As for Formation, the Soul lying in the seed, ^nakes its own house, for all
acknowledge a ^^rming faculty, and you must then suppose there is a ^ubstance
from whence this faculty flows. And though Aristotle ^aith that seed is a
living crea^ure in power; not that there is not the e^^ence ^f the Soul in the
seed, and that it is not a living ^^eature in respect of the first act, but
because (...) not come to the second act, for wan^ of ^it (...) which being
perfected, it has the second act and all its operations, which for defect of
organs, it cannot produce.

There are diverse opinions of the time of Formation, they are best that say the
membranes a^e first made, which wrap the child with the navel vessels, by which
it is joined to the Mothe^s womb, and receives nourishment for the child. Then
all other parts are made sooner or later, a^ the child requires for dignity or
necessity.

We intend here to speak of women's diseases. Therefore there are three things
required for the Formation of a child. 1. Fruitful seed from both parents, in
which the Soul remains that has a ^orming quality to make its own habitation.
2. The Mothers blood is required to enlarge the child to perfection. 3. There
is required a good constitution of the womb to nourish the seed, and stir the
concealed force. If these three be right, there is a child that is ^ound and
perfect, that will be born: but if any of these be wanting, there are Twins are
more, and other faults of which in order.

Chap. 5. Of the Generation of Twins, and many Children.
NAture has ordained that a woman should con^eive but one child^ in these and

the eleventh, had ^iv^ hundred and fourteen children at once, being Boys:
these are so seldom, that they seem incredible.

I speak nothing of the Causes of such monst^uous The Caus^s
productions, but of Twins, or Three, or Four. It is certain they are got at
one time: and this differs from Superfoetation, which is at many times. And you
must not impute it to the diverse Cells of the womb, for women have no such
Cells, but only a Line that divides the le^t side from the right; but it comes
from the division of the seed into diverse parts, and the least forming force in
the side is complete, and makes a child of every part of it. And because the
cavity of the womb cannot admit so many parts of seed, being no bigger then a
Bean; and if it do admit them, how can the seed be divided at one copulation
into so many parts? I suppose that such women have naturally a larger womb, so
that much seed is divided. And as Twins are begot at the same time, so they
have but one Placenta, or part tha^ receives the navel-vessels of both, but
they have their several Coats.

It is hard to know whether a woman have conceived The Sig^^.
Twins, only their belly is not even, but divided with seams and wrinkles; and
the weight is commonly greater, and the motion is not one nor alike.

Chap. 6. Of Superfoetation.
IT is seldom that a woman has many children at diverse copulations, but it is
so sometimes, and is called Superfoetation, that is a new conception after a
former. Though Hippocrates writes, 5. Aphor. 15.
That the mouth of the womb after Conception is so shut, that you cannot put in
a Needles point, yet a woman with child may take such pleasure after, that she
may a little open the womb to receive seed again, and draw it in, which may
form another child.

The Causes
Therefore the Cause is the pleasure the woman has, which opens the womb again
to attract seed. And it is necessary that the seed received, be in its proper
membrane, and peculiar receptacle.

The Differences.
These come sometimes sooner, sometimes later, sometimes the same day or the
following, sometimes longer after. Sometimes they have a third Superfoetation,
so that they have two living children, and one mischance.

The Signs.
It is known only by the motion of the infant, when it is conceived long after
the first.

The Prognostic.
It is dangerous for the Mother, for fear of abortion, and for loss of much
blood by two births at no great distance of time.

The Cure.
It is best to leave the whole work to Nature, and women ought to take heed of
Superfoetation; therefore after they have conceived, let them meddle no more.

Chap. 7. Of the ill Formation of the Child.
IN the Formation of the child, there are diverse Symptoms. 1. In the weakness
of the child. 2. The parts are more or ^ewer, to which you may refer
Hermaphrodites. 3. The parts are greater or less, as Dwarss or Giants. 4. There
is some part out of place or shape, as Histories ^^ew abundantly.

You must ^ind the Causes in the seeds, terms, The Causes
womb, and error in Formation: the cause of these is the action hurt of the
forming faculty. This is not always from it self, but from the unfitness of
the ma^ter, and fault in the place which kee^s it from the intention: for
actions of active things are not but in a disposed patient. Sometimes there is
an extraordinary cause, as imagination, when the Mother is frighted, or
imagines strange things, or longs vehemently for some mea^ which if she have
not, the child has a mark of the color or shape of what she desired, of which
there are many Examples.

But I doubt whether all errors in Formation, depend together upon the
imagination; for the Spirits and humors are troubled by the passions of the
mind, and so slow ^o^ceable imm^d^ately to the womb or other part, and this
disturbes the Author^^ sent^ntia.
^^rming faculty in its work. Also the forming ^^culty being overcome with
plenty of humo^s (...) wanting Spirits that are gone another way^ ^ay by ^hance
make an ill shape; therefore the ^^ssions of the mind are the first causes of
^rrou^ (...) Formation, and imagination ^^lps by (...) up the appetite. These
are the common errors of formation.

Others are dete^minate errors, not simply from the imagination by the pallions
which have no determination to such a thing; but no other cause can be besides
the imagination, but how she directs the forming faculty for the producing of
such effects, it is hard to be understood, but there must be some imagination
and the forming faculty, that it may impart the species sent from the external
senses to the forming faculty.

And this is the cause of the consent of the upper and lower faculties: for the
^oul is the same in the whole body; and every where ^itted with the same
faculties, but it does not exercise all in all parts, but by the proper
determinate organs ^^ instruments.

And though the child has its ^oul, yet while it is in the womb, it depends
upon the ^oul of the mother, as the fruits partake of the life of the tree
while they are upon it, therefore it is probable, that whatsoever moves the
faculties of the ^oul in the mother may move the same in the child: Hence it is
that while the forming operateth in the seed and womb of the mother, if any
species be sent to the imagination of the mother which she strongly receives,
it may make an impression upon the child, yet every imagination cannot make
this impression, but that which makes a great admiration or terror in the
mother when the forming faculty is at work, as when she beholds one with six
fingers, she brings forth the like, or when she produ^eth hair wh^^e it should
no^ be, or the l^^eness of a beast in an^ limb, or when she ^eeth any thing cut
or divided with a Cleaver, she brin^s ^orth a divided part o^ a Hare-lip.

Chap. 8. Of a Child turned into Stone.
JOhn Albosius Doctor at Senon, and Sim^on Prov^nch^r of Lingo Physician of
Senon writ of of this in French and Latin.

I shall give my opinion with others.

Two things are to be observed in this wonderful history, first why the Child
in the time of tra^ail being dead in the womb did not stink as is usual, or
kill the mother suddenly, or was not ^ast out by degrees being rotten? secondly
by what force the child was turned into Stone?

For the first, The mother lived twenty eight years after she had this Child,
therefore it is not credible that the womb was so cold that it might hinder
putre^action, as some think. It seems more probable to me, that these questions
explanation depend upon one principle, for the cause that made the stones
hardness, kept the child from putre^action, but what that is, it is obs^ure.

Many fly to the efficien^y of the first qualities, others to dryness, others
to coldness, others to both. I acknowledge heat, cold and dryness to be helping
causes for b^eeding of Stones in man's body, but the chief cause is a Stone
breeding juice, or spirit, of which I have spoken at large.

The principles of generation were weak in this child and impure, and this
stone-breeding ^^^ce was mixed with the blood in the humors, hence it is that
it was not born alive, as in a wole bred in the womb, which women have ^i^l
they a^e old and die with it, and yet it s^i^^s (...) no more then stones bred
in most parts. But there is but this History of such a Birth.

Chap. 9. Of a Mole.
IT is ^lesh and a mass without bones or bowels, gotten of an imperfect
conception instead of a child. The Latins call it a Mole from the weight,
because it is troublesome to women, as a Millstone in Latin called Lapis molaris.

The Differences.
Sometimes it is unshapen flesh without bones, only full of veins, with a skin
over it, and nothing within, but like the Parenchyma of the bowels. Pet. Salius
diu. in annot. in altimarum.
Sometimes it is membranous and ^ib^ous, without shape. Sometimes it is long,
round, or like a quary of glass, or like a brute beast Some have brought forth
three Moles like men's ya^ds.

Some are like congealed blood, or the Placenta of the womb, into which the
navel-vessels are inserted; some grow and are nourished, and some have an
obscure sense. Sometimes they are sent out alone, sometimes with or before the
child, of which there are many Histories. Some bring ^orth Monsters for Moles.

The Causes
It is from the error of the forming ^aculty, but the Cause of that is obscure.
I suppose it is from both seeds, when the forming faculty is weak, and the seed
little and not good, and overcome by much blood, and can make only veins and
membranes, and not a whole child. Sometimes (...) is in Widows only from their
own seed and blood.

A Mole is sooner bred when the blood is impu^e, and unfit to nourish, and is
made when they copu^^te in the flowing of the terms that are unclean. It is
neither from heat nor cold principally, but from the error of the forming
faculty.

They are hard to be known before the fourth The Signs.
month, then they are known by such as can distinguish between the motion of
wind and a child ^. If a woman turn from side to side, it ^alls like a stone to
that side she lies on, and is heavy. If it have any motion, it is trembling and
beating, with constriction and dilatation like a Sponge. If after the time that
the child should move, there be no motion, and the belly swells, and there is
no sign of a Dropsy, it is a sign of a Mole.

Thirdly, in women with child, there is milk about the fourth month, but in a
Mole the breasts swel, but there is no true milk. 4. They are more pained and
faint, and have more pain in their back and groyns.

If it be with a quick child, it is hard to be known, but it is known by its
weight in the womb, which she perceives when she gets up to walk or moves from
side to side; some are then strong and well colored.

It hurts the womb and whole body; if it be The Prognostic.
divided, it is less dangerous: when it is soft, it is cast out the third or

bleeding. Some have been cast out or drawn out Fabr. cent. 2. obs. 55.

overflowing of the Terms. As, Take Plantane, Shepheards-pu^s^, Brambles, Oa^
leaves, r^d Roses, e^ch a hand^ul; boil them in steeled Water, then take B^rley
bran t^o ounces, Pomegranate flowers, Cypress-nuts, P^megran^t^ p^els, red
Ros^s, Comfrey roots in p^uder, ea^h an ounce; Frogs burnt, Bole^ Sanguis
Draconi^, ^ach half an ounce; with the Decoction aforesaid, and a little
Vinegar, make a Cataplasm for the Region of the womb. Take away pain with
Anodynes mentioned in pain of the Womb: keep up the strength with meat of good
juice.

Question. Whether a Mole may be without the company of a man, and without his
seed?
To speak freely of this which many doubt, I suppose that many are made of a
weak man's seed mixed with the woman's seed, and much blood. But Histories
confirm that Widows have had them without man's seed, but not of the shape with
the others. And being voided, they melted being in the air into water.

I think Virgins cannot have them but from wantonness, or in sleep they may
spend their seed; but because it is weak, and the blood necessary for
formation, neither is drawn by the womb, nor flows to it of its own accord, as
it does in those that have had children, and the vessels of the womb in Virgins
are straiter then in Widows, and others that have had children. Therefore
though the seed of Virgins flow into the womb, yet they cannot have a Mole for
want of blood, which is necessary for the forming of the same. This is to be
understood of Moles which are not vital, for vital Moles that have some life,
cannot be got in Virgins or Widows without the seed of a man.

Chap. 10. Of Monsters.
HIstories tell us of many Monsters brought forth by women. We spoke of worms,
S^ct. 2. Chap. 8. They are like Toads or Mice ^ar. 7. cap. 12. l ij.
or Fi^^. Gordonius says it is usual in Lumbardy. Lycosthones says, and
others also, that Serpents Dogs, and other Monsters with parts like brute
beasts have ^een brought forth.

In appen. Franc. Ros. de par. c^esa.
Gaspar ^auhin speaks of one Anne Troperim, which 1575. brought forth two
Serpents with her child, in Harvest hot weather; she had d^u^k water in a Brook
in a Wood near Basil, where she thought she drank the Spawn of a Serpent, for a
little after that, her belly swelled, and three ^onths after she was big with
child, and the Serpents grew as the child did. Her belly was so big that she
carried it in a swathing Band. She was delivered at last of a lean male child,
and (because they suspect Worms or Snaks from the knawing and strange motion
she felt that year) they put a basin of milk under her, and when they expected
an afterbirth, out came a Serpen^, which she saw, and perceived another coming
forth, they were an ell long, and as thick as a child's arm. Thus Ba^^hin and he
speaks of others if you please to peruse him.

A Monster is that which is either wholly or in part like a beast, or that
which is ill shaped extraordinary.

The Caus^s
Histories witness, that a Monster may be from humane seed, and the seed of a
beast: It is seldom, for the forming faculty does not err of itself, but is
seduced by the imagination, or frustrated of its ends, from a fault of the
Spirits, the heat or matter. Therefore imagination is the ^ause of Monsters.
For Histories mention that w^men with child, by beholdin^ men in viza^ds, have
brought forth Monst^rs with horns, and ^eak^, and ^loven feet, The some is when
Spiri^s or heat, seed or blood are weak or little.

And though Doctors cannot cure Monsters, yet they are to admonish women with
child not to look upon Monsters, and to strengthen their Spirits and heat, and
to keep the seed and blood ^ight, and not to allow copulation in time of their
terms, least any monstrous Birth should be from much and impu^e blood.

Chap. 11. Of false Conception, and Swelling.
FAlse Conception or Gravidation is when the terms are stopped, and the belly
swells, and there are signs like those of a true Conception: then they think
themselves with child, and as Hippocrates says, They believe not to the
contrary till ten months are past.

The causes, are wind in the womb, or water, C^^s^e. p. 1. (...) 2. c. 10.
(...) matter, or thick ^^egm.

These are bred from sickly seed ret^ined, upon which Nature works in vain: or
from a fault in the terms tha^ ^or^upts the seed, and breeds bad h^mor^. The
like appears in Virgins when they begin to have their terms, but it is
discovered by pain.

The terms flo^ not as in a true Conception, The Signs.
but in this there is pain of the head, loins, belly, and groyns, of which
Hipp^crate^ ^aith thus; 2. Prorrhe^.

They are commonly barren, or have ulcers in their privities.

The Cure.
It is cured by evacuation of the matter in the womb with proper Medicines, as
in the Chapte^ of the Distemper of the Womb with matter, and of inflation of
the Womb and Drop^ie.

THE FOURTH BOOK.
THE SECOND PART.
THE FIFTH SECTION.
Of the Government of Women with Child, and preternatural Distempers in Women
with Child.
Chap. 1. Of the signs of Conception.
IF she keeps the ^eed, it is a sign she has conceived, and a man may know
that the seed is kept. If he find in Copulation that his Yard is is sucked and
drawn by the womb, and the privities are not moist. And if she per^eives little
or no ^eed ^o come forth again, and grow chill and quiver, (...) perceive a
^witching in her womb, from the ^reat delight: and the mouth of the wo^b
closes, and the (...) stop.

But they are deceived, when they count or reckon from the stoppage of the
terms. For some have their terms twice or thrice after they have conceived, and
some have them all along without hurt.

The chiefest sign of C^nception, is when there is at first loathing of meat,
pewking Pica, or preternatural appetite and vomiting. And when they hate that
they earnestly affected, or ^aint when they think of them.

About the fourth month, the child moves, which is not in a Mole the breasts
after that swel with milk, and the last are the surest signs. From the face and
urin there is no certainty.

Aphor. ^2. and ibi. 4^.
Hippocrates teaches us to know whether it be a Male or Female; If she be with
child of a Boy, she is better colored, but pale if of a Girl. And Boy^ lie on
the right side, and Girls on the left in the womb.

Chap. 2. Of the Government and Diet of Women with Child.
THe Diet is, either for such as are sound, or as have diseases.

Aphor. 12.
As for the air, Hippocrates says, If there be a wet warm winter with
Southernly winds, a dry spring with Northern winds, they who conceive in the
spring abort upon any small occasion. Or if they bring forth, their children
are weak and sickly, o^ die. Let her avoid all evil s^ents, as of Rue,
Pennyroyal, Mints, Castor, and Brimstone. Some cannot bear sweet scents, let
them not-look upon ^^^rible things, nor hear great noise of Guns.

Let meat be easy of concoction; let her e^^ Quinces to strengthen the child,
or sweet Almonds with Honey, sweet Apples, Grapes. Let her abstain from sharp
meats, very bitter or salt, and things that can provoke terms, as Garlic,
Onions, Olives, Mustard, Fennel, Pepper, and all Spices. In the last months,
Cinnamon is good, Summer fruits are naught for her, and all Pulse. When the
child is bigger, let her diet be more, for it is better for women with child to
eat too much then too little, least the child should want nourishment.

Let her drink moderately of clear Wine, not exercise too much, nor dan^^, nor
ride in a Coa^h that shakes her; let her not lift any great weights in the
first and last months. In the ninth month let her move a little more, to dilate
the pa^ts, and stir up natural ^eat.

Let her abstain from Venery in the first months, least there be a Mole or
Superfoetation, or the child be hurt, but she may use it moderately in the last.

She may bathe in the last months, once in a week to loosen the privy parts.
Let her avoid anger, sorrow, fear, and too much mirth.

Let her sleep rather then to be watchful. Let the belly be kept loose in the
first month, with Prunes, Raisons, or Manna in Broth. And let her use Medicines
to strengthen the womb and the child.

An Electuary. Take Conserve of Borage, Bugl^ss and red Roses, each two ounces;
of Balm an ounce, Citron peels, and Chebs Myrobalans candi^^, each an ounce;
Extract of Wood-aloes a s^ruple, Pearl prepared half a dram, red Coral, Ivory
^ach (...) dram; precious Stones, each a scruple; candied N^^me^s two drams,
with Syrup of Apple^ and Quinces, ma^e an Electuary.

Rouls. Take Pearls prepared a dram, red Cor^^ prepared and Ivory, each half a
dram, precious ston^^ ea^h a scruple; yellow Citron peels, Mace, Cinnamon,
Cloves, each half a dram; Saffron a scruple, Wood-aloes ^alf a s^ruple,
Ambergreece six drams, with six ounces of Sugar dissolved in Rose-wa^er, make
Rou^s.

Apply strengtheners to the navel: of Nutmegs, Cl^ves, Mace, Mastich, Coral
made up in bags, or a Toast in Malmsey sprinkled with powder of Mints.

Chap. 3. Of the Cure of Women with Child in General.
THey have diverse chronick and acute diseases: as Fevers, Pleuri^ie Quinzies,
or inflammation of the Bowels, of which Hippocrate^ 5. Aphor. 31.
(If a Woman with child have an acute disease, it is deadly) There is a double
danger. 1. In respect of the Fever which Galen ^aith will be continual. 2. In
respect of the want of nourishment Valor. l. 1. obser. ^ol. com. ad lib. 5.
a^h. 30.
for the child. For if a woman with child be fed, the Fever increases. If ^he
have an Apoplexy, Epilep^ie, Convulsion, Cramp, she cannot bea^ it out^ But
acute diseases are not always deadly in women with child.

They have sometimes intermitting Fevers, Coughs, from which they hardly are
freed before they are delivered.

Question. 1. Whether must Women with child use a sparing Diet?
Gal. ^it. lo.
I^ you give her a Diet at a long distance, the child will be starved. If you
give her a ^ul diet, and often the fever will endanger both mother and child.

Therefore be moderate, and add something to the diet which the mother loves
before the fever, for the child's sake, and for the fever. Abate the diet in
the first months^ let the diet be little in the middle and last months, let it
be larger.

Question. 2. Whether may a Woman with Child be let blood?
Hippocrates ^aith, If a woman with child be let 5. Aphor. 50.
bl^od, she will miscarry, and if the child be older the sooner. This is to be
understood of great bleeding, which was pints in his time, but now we go by
ounces.

Therefore if bleeding be required in a fever, or the like, and the woman with
child be in strength, you may boldly let blood upon these ^onditions. 1. That
you take not nourishment from the child, let it be a little, and you will t^ke
more, do it the second time, least you weaken. 2. Open not the foot nor the
Basilica, but the M^diana. 3. Before you bleed, strengthen the child by
applications to the navel. And if they abort Amat. Lusit. c. 5. cur. 27. rod. a
cast. 3. de morb. mul.
in a fever, you must impute it rather to the vio^ence of the fever, then to
the bleeding, and you u^^d the necessary help for preserving the mother. But it
is safer in the first then in the last months, ^e^^use the child needs a
further diet.

You may also open a vein in a woman with ^hild, that has no disease to
prevent abortion, ^hen there is much blood, in the fourth or fifth ^^n^h,
especially if they have no fever, and are ^^rong. As Celsus ^aith, A strong
C^ild, and a Lib. 2^ c. 10.
(...) old man, and a healthy woman with child, may be sifely let blood. And
Hippocrates forbids b^eeding only, least the child should want nourishment.

Question 3. Whether m^y^ a Woman with Child be purged?
You must not give strong Purges, least their force which moves the humors,
should reach t^ the womb, and cast out the child. Therefore you must not purge
women with child in all diseases, nor at all times, but only in the fourth
month ti^ the seventh, and that sparingly. And if the matter 4. Aphor. 1.
swell and abound, as Hippocrates shows. For the danger from the turgent matter
is easily avoided thereby: for it will be purged with more ease, then when it
is fixed and quiet. 1. Therefore only purge in an acute disease. 2. From the
beginning of the fourth only to the end of the si^th^ 3. Use no vehement
Medicine, no^ very bitter, as Aloes which is an enemy to the child, and opens
the mouths of the vessels; no^ Co^oquintida, nor Scammony, nor Turbith, but use
Cassia, Manna, Rhubarb, Agarick and Senna: but Diacydonium purgans is best with
a little of the Electuary of the ju^ce of Roses.

If there be a chronick di^ease, she may also be purged safely, especially if
she be used to it, and strengtheners be applied to the navel.

Question 4. Whether purging or bleeding is most dangerous for a Woman with
Child?
We s^^wed in the last Question the necessity of purging and its danger by the
great motion of humors, which if i^ reach to the womb, causes abortion,
because it causes pain in the belly, and provokes the te^ms. But bleedin^
di^^urbs the humors less, nor does hurt any way, but by taking nourishment from
the child^ And this you need not fear, if there be too much blood. Therefor
pu^ging is more dangerous then bleeding.

Question 5. Whither is it lawful to cause an Abortion to preserve the Mother?
A Christian may not cause an abortion for any cause, for it is wicked^ and the
Gentiles in Hipp^crates his time never allowed it, they would not hinder
Conception, much less would they destroy it when made. Nor must the mo^her be
p^eserved by the loss of the child, For we must not do evil, that good may come
thereby.

But if to preserve the mother, the Physician purge or bleed, and the abortion
follow, the fault is not the Physician that intended it not, but in the
weakness of Nature and of the child, and is better to preserve the mother, then
by neglecting the lawful means, let both die. Also the dead child must
presently be thrown out.

Question 6. Whether are Clysters, Diuretics and Swea^s prop^r for a Woman
with Child?
Though women deny Clysters to them, yet if they have been used to them, they
may be given in a (...) quantity, such as only molli^ie and sup^le, no^ do they
more hurt th^n Lenitives.

Di^^eticks or things that provoke urine, are ^^t safe, because they p^ovoke
the t^^ms. You (...) not give g^ntle Sweats, for Nature will re^^ive strength
by the castin^ off of her enemies. ^ou may use Alterers that are proper, as
this Syrup. Take the juice of unripe Grapes about the beginning of September
three galons, add Pom^^itrons or Lemons bruised hal^ a pound: boil them (...)
they are soft, and strain them, and with half a pou^^ of Sugar make a Syrup.

Chap. 4. Of the Symptoms that befall Women with Child in in the first months.
THey are loathing of meat, Pica, or evil appetite, pewking, vomiting,
belly-ach, flux of the belly, tooth and headache, giddiness.

These all come from the stoppage of the terms, especially in a Cacochymy or
evil juice: for it goes to the stomach, and so to the head. First, 5. Aphor. 45.
^^ey loath meat, which Hippocrates ^aith is a sign of Conception. And this is
when the child takes the purest blood, and leaves the impure, which gets into
the mouth of the stomach, and insects it, and hence comes the loathing of some
sorts o^ meats.

Sometimes this cease of it self; but if there be danger of a Consumption in
the mother, le^^ the child should be in danger for want of food, give a gentle
Vomit or Stomach-pills, with things that strengthen the Stomach. As, Take
Co^ser^^ of red Rose^ half an ounce, of Bettony an ounc^, p^^served Quinces
three dram^, Aromaticum (...) half a dram, Pearl prepared half a scruple, (...)
Syrup of green Ginger and Quin^es, make an E^^ctuary.

Anoint the stomach with oil of Mastich, (...) Quinces, Wormwood, Mirtles, etc.
Give (...) and powerful things with (...) roasted rather then boiled.

Pica is when they desire strange and absurd things, as coals, ashes, etc. as
she that longed for her husbands flesh, and though she loved him very well; she
killed him, eat part, and poudered up the rest. Of this disease we spoke in the
third Book.

Juice of young Vine-^eaves with syrup of Quinces, is good against this, or the
water that drops in May from the Vines. This keeps the child from suffering by
the mothers appetite.

Or this Spirit. Take Citron peels, Oranges, P^^ny roots as much as you please,
add Malmsey, di(...) them some days, then beat the roots and peels, ad more
Malmsey, and distill them.

The third is loathing and vomiting, from an evil vapor or humor in the stomach
from blood retained. If vomiting gives her ease, stop it not, but leave it to
Nature, it will cease after a month or two. If it be with trouble, give a gentle
Vomit, or strengthen the stomach, or give a little Rhubarb.

The fourth is pain of the belly, from wind and humors about the womb that go
to the guts, discuss them as in Chap. 3. of the Colic. Avoid moist
Fomentations, give Cinnamon water, or spiced Wine.

The fifth is a looseness which must be suddenly stopped, least it cause an
abortion. First, give a Hippocr. 5. Apho^ 34.
^entle Clenser and strengthener, ^s Rhubarb with ^^^up of Roses solutive, then
Quinces at the first course at meals; and Rice, Starch, Almonds, Con^^^^e of
Rose^, Quinces. Apply to the navel a Pull(...) of Quinc^s, Mastich, Nutmegs,
Mace, Cloves.

The sixth is the toothach, from a sh^rp humor ^^om retention of the terms that
goes to the r^ot (...) some tooth, and hurts the membranes. It cease commonly
of (...) self, yet if it be great, use a Plaster of Mastich and Tacamahacca to
the temples, and hold in the mouth the Decoction of Fern root^, Cinquefoyl,
Snakeweed, Sage, Mulberry ba^^^ etc.

The seventh is headache, when the vapors from the terms stopped, ascend and
twitch the memb^ane^ of the brain, it must be repelled and abated with
Lenitives, of which in Lib. 1. Part 3. Sect. 1. Cap 3. of Headache.

The eighth of the Megrim, from the vapors disturbing the Spirits that go to
the head by the veins and arteries, or by the gullet. If it cease not, discuss
vapors, and strengthen the brain inwardly and outwardly as in Vertigo.

Chap. 5. Of the Symptoms in Women with Child in the middle months.
THey are cough, heart-beating, fainting, watching, pain in the loins and hips,
and bleeding.

1. The cough is from a sharp vapor that comes to the jaws and rough artery
from the ter^s, or from a thin part of that blood gotten into the ^eins of the
breast, or falling from the head to the breast. This endangers abortion, and
strength ^ails from watching; therefore purge the h^mors that f^ll from the
head to the breast, with Rhubarb, Agari^l^, and strengthen the head as in a
C^tarrh, and giv^ ^^eet Lenitives, as in (...) Cough.

2. Palpitation of he^^t and fainting, is f^^m vapors that go to it by the
^rteries, or from bl^^^ that abounds, and cannot get out at the womb, but
ascends and oppre^leth the heart. Use Cordials as in Syncope inwardly and
outwardly.

If it be from too much blood as in Plethory, open a vein.

3. Watching is from dry sharp vapors that trouble the animal Spirits. Then use
Frictions, and wash the feet at bedtime, and give Syrup of Poppies, dried
Roses, Emulsions of sweet Almonds, and white Poppy seeds.

4. There is pain in the loins and hipps from the weight of the child, or from
the terms stopped, or growth of the child that stretches the ligaments of the
womb and parts adjacent; if there be Plethory, bleed. If it be from weight of
the child, hold it up with swathing Bands about the neck.

5. There is flux of blood at the womb, nose, o^ Haemorrhoids from plenty, or
from the weakness of the child that takes it not in, or from evil humors in the
blood, that stir up Nature to send it forth. Also the vessels of the womb may
be broken or torn by motion, fall, cough, or trouble of mind. This is
dangerous, of which Hippocrates 5. Ap^^. 60.
says, The child cannot be well, if it be from blood only, there is less
danger, so it ^lows by the veins of the neck of the womb for it takes a^ay
Plethory, or take not nourishment from the child.

If it be from the weakness of the child that draws it not, abortion often
follows, or hard travel, or she goes beyond her time. If it slow by the inward
veins of the womb, there is mo^e dang^r by the openness of the womb. If it come
from evil blood, the danger is alike from Cacochymy which is like to fall upon
both. If th^r^ be Plethory, open a vein warily, and use astringents. As, Take
Pearls prepared a scruple, (...) Coral two s^ruples, Mace, Nutmeg, ea^h a dram;
Cin^^mon hal^ a dram, make a Po^der, or with Sugar, R^u^s: or give this Powder
in Broth. T^k^ red Coral a dram, Pearl half a dram precious ston^^, ea^h half
a scruple; red Sanders half a dram, Bo^^ a dram, sealed Earth, Tormentil roots,
e^ch two s^ruples; with Sugar of Roses and Manus Christi, (...) Pearl six
drams, make a Powder.

You may strengthen the child at the navel^ I^ there be Cacochymy alter the
humo^s, and (if you may) evacuate. You may use Amulets in the hands, and about
the neck. In flux of Haemorrhoids, beware of the pain. Let her d^ink hot Wine
with a roasted Nutmeg.

Chap. 6. Of the Symptoms that are in the last months.
FIrst, the urin is stopped from suppression of the ne^k of the bladder. Let her
then lie d^wn^ and let bladder be fomented with a Bag of P^llito^y, Par^ley
roots^ M^llows, Lineseed, and the like, o^ use the C^theter.

2. The belly is bound from a hot and dry live^^ when the child d^^ws all the
moisture to it, (...) the guts. Let her then use Moist^ers, (...) Butter,
M^llows, Borage in Broaths; or take Clysters in a small quantity.

3 The veins appear in the hips and legs a^ varic^ns only, then keep them
from walking^ and let th^i^ ^eet be laid upon a stool.

4. The l^ggs swell from ^erous blood, but thi^ goes away with the a^terbirth,
and is the signs (...) a female child; but if she cannot walk, foment ^ith a
Lie made of Vine branches and Wine, or with a Decoction of Organ, Penn^royal,
Chamomil, Calamints. Or,

Take Bean and Lupine flour, each tw^ ^unces; Tartar an ounce, Pigeons dung
half an ^unce, with ^eeled water and juice of Coleworts, make a Pultis. R^b and
wash the feet with salt water in which Ch^momi^, Organ and Dill were bo^led.

5. The skin of the belly is cle^t with stretch^ng after the fourth month;
therefore use loosning Limments to keep off deformity, as marrow of Veal, and
Sheeps legs, Oil of sweet Almonds, Hens grease.

6. The water gathered in time of being with ^hild, between the membranes that
hold the ^hild, comes forth too soon, because the membranes are broken by
leaping or a con^usion. This makes difficult birth, for that water was to
moisten the parts, Therefore let her keep a good diet, and strengthen the ^hild
inwardly and outwardly.

Chap. 7. Of Weakness of the Child.
THis is either from weak seed or little nourishment or bad, and causes many
diseases in the child.

To hinder abortion and death of the child, know rightl^ the weakness, as
Hippocrates says, 5. Ap^o. 53.
They that will abort, have first breasts that ^al away, which i^ from want of
nourishment in the common vei^s of the womb and breasts. Hipp^crates 5^ Ap^^r.
5^.
^ath a se^ond sign^ which is this^ I^ a W^man with Child has much milk
flowing from her breast, her Child is weak. 3. If the terms flow often, the
Hippocr. 5. aph^r. 56.
nourishment is taken from the child. 4. A mother often and long being sick,
shows that her child is weak, because her blood is not good, and the bad humors
with the blood go to nourish the child which makes him sick. 5. When the mother
has a flux of the belly, the child is weak. 6. When it begins to move, and is
scarce felt, it is weak.

If it be from these causes, take them away, and strengthen the child; first
^eed the mother high with meats of good juice, and sweet Almonds steept in
Honey, Raisons, Quinces, outwardly thus. Take Malmsey three pints, dissolve it
in oil ^f Nutmeg^ by expr^ssion half an ounce, add powder of Cloves, Rue, each
half an ounce; Rose, Sage, Mar^oram, Penny^oyal water, each a pint; Aqua vitae
three ounces. Dip Spunges in it, and apply them under the le^t breast, to the
armpits, hams, pulses, soles of the feet, and when they dry, wet them again.

Chap. 8. Of Crying in the Womb.
CHildren have sometimes cried in the womb, as Fabricius says in his Epistle to
his Brother James Fin^el, and W^inridi^k of Monsters, writes thus, In this City
of Bressa a child was heard to cry in the womb three days before the travel;
when he was a man, he was mis^rable with poverty and dis^as^s, till he died.
Andreas Libavi^^ writes the same, and others.

Some sa^ it portends evil to the Mother, or Child, or Country.

The ^auses
It is a v^ice by the expulsion of the air th^ou^h the ^ough arte^y, and some
air may in the c^vities from vapors or Spirits, as in eggs when chickens pip in
them. And if the child have a rough artery, lungs and breasts which are the
organs of breathing ^ound, and the child is strong, there is no hinderance but
it may utter a voice. But something whatsoever it is, must stir it to make this
noise.

THE FOURTH BOOK.
THE THIRD PART.
THE SIXTH SECTION.
Of Symptoms that happen in Childbearing.
Chap. 1. Of Childbearing in General.
WHEN the child can no longer be contained in so small a place, being grown,
and requiring mo^e nourishment, it ki^ks, and b^eaks the membranes and
Ligaments that h^ld it, and the womb by an expelling f^culty, sends it forth
with great straining^ and this is called ^ravel.

It is either natur^l or not natural, legitima^e or illigitimate. The natural
is when the child ^omes with the head forward and heels upwards, with his hands
and arms to his thighs, and so the other parts easily follow, then the Amnios
is broken, and the water that was laid up in time of being with child flows
forth, and moistens the passa^es, then the child with more force breaks the
Acetabula, from which the Secundine is separated, and the other membranes are
broken, and the blood flows into the cavity of the womb, and the child gets out
by the expulsive faculty with such force, that it seems to fall rather then be
expelled, and the bones of the privities must needs be divided.

That which follows the birth is above humane capa^ity, namely the
transmutation of the navel vessels, and lungs, and heart in the infant, and why
Nature ordered it, of which Galen elegantl^ in the 15. Book of the Use of
Parts, and 6. Chapter.

There is also a legitimate birth, when it is acco^ding to the Law of Nature,
and an illegitimate, when it is before or after the time.

Hippocra^es says that a birth in the seventh Lib. de s^ptim. p^rcu.
month is vital and legitimate. And it is sooner from the strength of the
faculty and matter ^it for formation, yet it is commonly weak, except the
^eventh month be complete.

Of the eighth month Hippocrates ^aith thus, None live^ that is born in the
eighth month, because i^ cannot bear the two affliction^ to follow, but the
reason of the Arithmeticians is better, that say an even month is imper^ect.

The ninth and tenth month are the best, as Lib. de natura pueri. Lib. Sapient.
c. 8.
Hi^p^crate^ ^aith; A child is born in ten months at the f^rthest, and so ^aies
the wisest Solomon. Some say that a child may ^e born in the eleventh month,
and Peter Apponensis was so born; and some say they have been born in the
fourteenth and fifteenth month: but rare things are not to be counted the Law
of Nature.

Generally Physicians agree with Hippocrates, though some dissent.

Chap. 2. Of Abortion.
IT is the exclusion of a child, not perfect nor living, before legitimate
time. This time is defined Lib. de c^rnib.
by Hippocra^es, Whosoever conceives, does it within seven days, but they are
properly abortions that come before the seventh day; and though some are in the
fifth and sixth month that have lived, yet that must not d^rogate from the
common Law of Nature.

Some differences of Abortion are from the time and bigness of the child. For
that which is cast out, is little and round, without distinction of members at
first, like a Grape. Sometimes as long as a ^inger, and members may be
distinguished. And sometimes the child is almost perfect.

The Causes
The immediate Cause, is the expulsive faculty sti^red up, and that is done by
three means from Galen, from the weight, bigne^s and pain. 3. De nature f^c.
^ap. 12.
There are more causes which we shall place in two Ranks. The first is of the
manner of the causes that provoke the expulsive faculty. The other is that
which ^indeth out these ways by all the causes.

The expulsive f^culty is first provoked by the child being weak, either from
evil seed, or being dead. The child is weak for want of food, and from the
mothers diseases, either in her whole body, or in the womb, or parts adjacent
that consent, as Fevers, Inflammations, Fainting, Convulsions, Pain, Vomiting,
Neesing. Cough that move the Spirits and humors^ and shake the child and stir
up Nature to expel it.

Also straitness of the womb causes Abortion, by which means it cannot contain
a great child. Al^o shortness of the navel-vessels, which Fabricius first
observed.

The outward Causes, are cold air after hot and moist, which gets into the
womb, and provokes it, and hu^ts the child. The Astrologers Cent 2. obs. 50.
add the malignant aspects of the Stars: also too much or too little meat.
Great watchings, purging, and flux of blood by the womb and Haemorrhoids. Also
violent motion, as leaping, carrying of burdens, strokes on the belly or ba^k.
Also passions, as anger, fear, sorrow.

Also bleeding, purging, fasting, ^mel of brims^one or ashes, hoofs burnt, or
stink of the snu^^ of a candle.

If the breasts be less, or much milk flow from The Signs.
them, or she feel much and often pain about the belly or loins, that go to the
Pubes and Os sac^um, with a desire of thrusting forth in the womb. If the child
change its place, and if it f^l lower when it was in the middle of the belly,
there is fear of miscarr^ing.

It is dangerous alwa^^s, because it is with violence, The Pro^nos^i^k.
there are also great Symptoms: they are in l^^s danger that have already
brought forth a ^hild; ^^^refore the first is most danger^us, and (...) mou^^s
of the vessels ar^ to^n, and they commonl^ become barren. Abortion is most
dange^o^s in the sixth, seventh and eighth month, be^^^se the in^ant being
^^eater, ^^useth greater pain, and breaks the Ligaments worse.

To preserve from Abortion.
Consider the constitution before she is with child, and prevent every cause.
If it be like to come from Plethory before Conception, open a vein, and after
Conception in the fourth or ^i^th month, in the arm.

I^ it be from Cacochymy, purge the whole body, and purge the womb with
Pessaries, and streng^hen it, of which in the cold and moist distemper of the
Womb

If she have conceived, open a vein before the time she used to abort; i^ there
Cacochymy purge gently at times. If there be a cold distemper of body by phlegm
that hurts the womb, give the d^coction of China or Sar^a, with strengtheners
of the child

Avoid the external Causes of Abortion, and if they have done hur^, help it
presently. Let not the belly be bound; if the child be weak, ^^move the causes
of weakness, and strengthen i^^ Use things that strengthen the womb and child,
as Coral as Kermes-berries.

Or, Take Magistery of Coral a dram, Pearl p^^pared half a dram, Ivory shaved a
dram, Ma^^i^^ half a dram, grains of Kermes a dram, Manus ^^risti with Pearl
two drams, make a Powder. I^ the Abortion be at hand, and the pains increase,
give this Powder with a rear Eg Or, Take Con^^r^^ of red Roses two drams, red
Coral a^^ Ma^^i^h, ^^^h a scruple; give i^ presently.

Use the ^ounte^^es Oy^tment outwardly to the Loins, R^ins, P^c^^n and
Perinaeum. Or, Take Oil of Roses, Mirt^es, Ma^^i^h, Q^inces, ea^^ two ounces;
Oil of Mints an ounce, Bdellium (...) in Vinegar, liquid Storax, each two
ounces; Oil of Nutmegs by expression a dram, with Wax make an Ointment. Of the
same with Pitch, Rosin, Colophony, you may make P^aisters. Let her hold a
Loadstone in her hand, or tie it to her navel, or wear an Eagle stone under her
armpits, or Coral, Jaspar, Smaragds, Diamonds. If these will not keep the
child up, you must give over A^^ringents, and use Leni^ives.

Question. Whether the straitness of the Womb, is the Cause of Abortion?
Hippocrates 1. de morb. says, That the Womb Lib. de super. lib. de steril.
may cause Abortion, if they be windy, thic^, great, (...) little: and he shows
in another place that Abortion may be from the straitn^ss of the womb. And in
another place he says, I^ a woman in the (...) De not. ^ac. c. ^2.
third, ^ourth or fifth m^nth mi^^arry, often, a^^ at the some time, it is
because the womb will not stretch. And Galen confirms the same, and i^ st^nds to
reason, for natural birth is when the womb cannot contain the child for its
growth. Th^r^for^ i^ it be ^^eternaturally too little, it i^ the cause o^
Mor^^on. And though Nature has made the womb ^o hold the child, yet i^ i^ be
not made large enough, it cannot ^^ntain it; so the stomach i^ ^^mtim^s so
strait, that it cannot hold an indi^f^^ent quantity of me^t, as others can.

Chap. 3. Of the Signs of Natural Birth, and the manner and Government of such
as bring ^orth.
AT her tim^ of her b^in^ t^ be deliv^red, let ^er tak^ h^^d of ^st^ing^n^s and
thic^n^^s, but let her eat meat of easy concoction, and o^ good juice, and sit
every fourth day in a h^t Bath. Of Mallows, Foenugreek, Linseed, Mugwort and
Chamomil flowers; and after let h^^ back, loyns^ belly and privities be
anointed wit^ the Mucilag^ of Althaea seed, and Oil of Lillies^ and let the
child b^ st^engthened.

But when ^^e has pains from the navel to the groyn^, and in the back, then
the ligaments a^^ vessels are broken, by which the child grow^ (...) the womb.
And because the womb violently strains to discharge it; the membranous ^ib^es
are extended, and commonly there are very great pains, and throws, or the child
will not be born, and it is an evil sign when throw^ cease, because the
expulsive faculty is weaken^d. And let not the Midwi^e provoke throws till the
time.

When the membranes are broken, the water flows out, that comes from the urin
and sweat o^ the child, first little, then more, then wate^ish blood, and the
ori^ice of the womb begins to open to let out the child^ And before this time,
you must not provoke throws. Then let the Midwi^e put her ^inger into the
ori^ice of the womb, and she shall perceive something round and hard as an egg.
Let her not lie on her back flat, but with her back up, that she may breathe
more freely.

After the child is born, you must press the blood in the navel-vessels toward
the navel of the in^ant, and take heed that you loose not much blood in cutting
off the ^^vel-string, for it ha^^ destroyed weak children, and you must l^bo^
^o (...) out the S^^u^dine with the child: and i^ it b^ in the womb, anoint
your hands with ^a^m oy^, and ^u^ them i^to the womb, and ^etch i^ out.

Chap. 5. Of Natural hard Travel.
THough Childbearing since Eves sin is ordained to be painful as a puni^hment
thero^, yet sometimes it is more painful then ordinary.

The first is from the mother, and the expulsive The Causes
faculty. 2. From the Child. 3. From the passage,. From the mother, as when the
womb is weak, and the mother is not active to expel from weakness or diseases
or want of spi^its, 5. Aphor. 55.
of which Hippocrates.

It is from the birth when there are twins or more, and both strive to go forth
at a ^ime, or if the child stick to a Mole, or be so weak that it cannot break
the membrane, or if it be too big all over, or in the head only, or if the
Navil vessels are twisted about his neck.

It is from the passages when the membranes a^e thick, the ori^ice too strait,
and the neck of the womb is not open sufficiently, as in such as Fabric. cent.
3. obs. 57.
labor of the first child, or are very fat. The passages are pressed and
straightened by tumors in the adjacent parts, or when the bones are too fi^m and
will not open, then the mother and child a^e both in danger, or when the
passages are not ^^^ipp^ry, or when they are broken too soon by reason of the
thin membranes, or the water flows ^^^th sooner then it ought.

You may know hand Travel by ^^int throws, The Signs.
that come at a great distance. And you must consider all things concerning the
mother, womb ^^d child.

The Prognostic.
In hard Travel, the mother and child are in danger, and the Perinaeum
sometimes breaks with the skin from the privities to the Arsehole. If a woman
be four days in travel, the child scarce escapes.

The Cure.
All things that move the terms are good to make easy delivery, As Myrrh,
white Amber in white Wine or Lillywater, two scruples or a dram. Some give a
drop of oil o^ Amber in Vervain water, or a scruple of mineral Borax, or half a
dram, but begin with gentle things, as a spoonful of To Cure al diseases Read
my Sennertus, Platerus, Riverius, Bartholinus, and Riolanus, of the last
Edition.
Cinnamon water. Or, Take Cassia Lignea, Dittany, each a dram; Cinnamon hal^ a
dram, Saffron a scruple, make a Powder, give a dram. Or, Take Borax mineral a
dram, Cassia Lignea a scruple, Saffron six grains, give it in Sack. Or, Take
Cassia Lignea a dram, Dittany, Amber, each half a dram^ Cinnamon, Borax, each a
dram and half; Saffron a scruple, give half a dram.

Or give some drops of oil of Hazel in convenient liquor, or two or three drops
of oil of Cinnamon in Vervain water, some prepare the secundine thus: Take the
Navel string and dry i^ in an Oven. Take two drams of the powder, Cinnamon a
dram, Saffron half a scruple, with juice of Savin make Troches, give two drams,
or wash the S^^urdine in Wine, and bake it in a pot, then wash it in Endive
water and Wine. Take half a dram of it, long Pepper, Galangal, each half a
dram; Piant^ne and Endi^e seed, each a dram and half, La^ender seed four
scruples, make a powder.

Or, Take Labdanum two drams, Storax ca^ami^e, ^e^^^in, each half a dram; Musk
and Ambergrease each six grains; make a powder, or Tro^^^s for a ^^me, o^ use
pessaries to provoke the bi^th. T^ke Galb^nu^ (...) in Vine^^^ an oun^^, Myrrh
two drams, Saffron a dram, with oil of Orris make a Pe^^ary. An Ointment for
the Pecten and Navil. Take oil of Keir two ounces, juice of Savin an ounce, of
Leeks and Mercury, ea^h half an ounce, boil them to the consumption of the
juice, add Galbanum dissolved in vinegar half an ounce, Myrrh two drams, Storax
liquid a dram, round Birthwor^, Sowbread, Cinnamon, each half a dram; Saffron a
scruple, with Wax make an ointment.

Also neesing provoke the birth and Amulets, 5. Aphor. 35.
As a Snakes skin about her middle, the Aeglestone bound to her thigh.

If weakness be the cause, refresh her with Leui len^. de oc. not. mir. lib. 4.
c. 12.
Wine and sops to the nose, Consect. Alkernies, Diamose. Diamarg.

If there ^e twins, let the Midwife order them with her hands, and help the
foremost.

If the passages be not slippery, use an emollient Fomentat^on, and oil of
sweet Almonds, Hens or Ducks grease, etc. If the belly be bound give a Clyster
or Suppository.

When medicines will not do it, break the membrane Aetius ^etra. 4. cip. 23.
with the ^ingers dipped in oil, or cut them.

When the Child is still ^orn, let the M^dwife show Spices and blow in its
mo^th, or drop Aqua vitae in it, or anoint it with Honey.

Chap. 6. Of a vicious disorderly birth, or difficulty preternatural.
IF the head come not forth first, and the hands and ^eet are upwards there is
an ill birth. The Causes


Hippocrates reckons two causes, the largeness Lib. de not. pu.
of the womb, and disorderly motion of the mother from pain, also the thickness
of the membrane, which when it cannot break with the head, it attempts to do
with the feet and hands.

The Signs.
The midwife may perceive in what figure the child comes forth.

The Prognostic.
All disorderly coming forth is dangerous to mother and child, but there is
least danger when both ^eet come forth, this is called by the Latins Partus
Agrippin^s.

The Cure.
Let the Midwife reduce it into the cavity of the womb when it comes not forth
right, and place it right.

When the feet cannot be thrust upwards, let the Midwife fupple the parts with
oil, and take hold of the arm and help it, and give neesings.

Let her always labor to put the child in a right posture by moving it with
her hand, or taking the mother from the bed, and compose her in such a posture
as may bring the child into a right posture, and that soon.

Chap. 7. Of a slow Birth.
THis is when the child is longer coming forth then ordinarily, ^f this Massa
writes that a Venetian Matron conceived of a husband ^pis^^l. to. 2 29. ^pis.
of seventy years of age, and brought forth a child in the ^i^teenth month
blind and without hands which lived five months. Cardanns writes C^^sil. 85. ad
christ. (...)
that his father said he was born in the thi^teenth month, and Mercurialis
writes thus. That it was never seen or written that a woman had a live chi^d
f^ur years in her belly, etc. but these are rare and miraculous.

The cause is the weakness of the seed, and want of heat in the womb, which
makes the expulsive ^aculty weak.

Chap. 8. Of a Child dead in the womb.
WHen at the time of Childbirth, there is pain and breaking ^orth of water,
which cease presently without delivery, the child remaining in the womb, then
the mother or the child dies, or both.

When the travel is vehement from diverse causes, The Causes
they may also cause no birth, for either the more she may lose her strength
and the child not come forth, or both may die.

And if the child be weak and move little, or the mother may be weak and the
child great, the travel is hard and both die, or if the child come not forth in
a right posture.

Or if the passages are ill proportioned, as Fabri. cent. 1. obs. 64. and 67.
when the bones of the Pubes do not give way, or when there is Schirrhus, or
other tumor that straitneth the passages^ there is no delivery.

Or the child dies by a disease for want of nourishment, or a fall, stroke, or
leap, or passion in the mother.

Search if the child be living or dead, for if it The Signs.
be dead it will hurt the mother by rotting, and if the mother die and child be
alive, take it out before the mother be buried.

A child is known to be dead if the mother and Midwi^e perceive no motion, nor
is it raised by any strengtheners given, and when the mother moves from side to
side, i^ moves like a stone, o^ when the face and lips of the mother are pale,
and her extreme parts livid: and the breasts that were plump, are fallen; her
breath sttinks, water and stinking matter flows from the womb; there is a
Fever, horror and fainting, or Convulsion; or if the Secundine come forth
before the child.

The Prognostic.
If a dead child be not presently taken out, the mother is in great danger:
there are great Symptoms, and strange diseases, of which see Francis Rousset
and others.

The Cure.
When the child comes not forth in time; and is alive, it must be taken out by
the Midwife or Surgeon by cutting the belly and womb, of which in the
Chapter following. If it be dead, you must drive, or take it out before it
stinks, either by Medicines or Surgery.

The Medicines are such as stir up the expulsive faculty, but they must be
stronger then before, because the motion of the child cease, as Take Savin,
round Birthwort, Troches of Mirrh, Castor, each a dram; Cinnamon half an ounce,
Saffron a scruple: give a dram with Savin-water.

Or, Take Borax, Savin, Dittany, each an ounce; Mirrh, Asarum rooes, Cinnamon,
Saffron, each half a dram; make a Powder, give a dram.

Purge first, and put her in an emollient Bath, and anoint about the womb with
Oil of Lillies, sweet Almonds, Chamomil, Hens and Goosegrease.

Foment to get out the child with a Decoction of Mercury, Orris, wild
Cowcumber, Staechas, Broom flowers. Then anoint the Privities and Loins with
Ointment of Sowbread. Or, Take Colaquiwida, Agarick, Birthwort, each a dram;

but leave all to God.

Chap. 9. Of the Caesarean Birth.
THe belly and womb are cut sometimes to take out the child, and this is called
the Caesarean Birth, and they that live are called Caesar's. It is done in three
cases. 1. When the child is dead, and the woman liv^. 2. When the woman is
dead, and the child alive. 3. When both mother and child are alive.

This is seldom, because either Medicines do it, or it is taken out by other
Surgery, or the Enchirid. consul. modic. page 188.
work is left to Nature. Mathias Cornax has a History of one that carried a
dead child in her belly four years, it was taken out by cutting the womb and
belly, and the mother lived, and conceived with child after: she fainted not at
the time, and the wound grew together without stitching; and her terms after
came in good order, and she had a lusty Boy till the 2. of June. The Surgeons
that had cut her before were sent for, and the old orisice was open, and the
mother and the women present, would not yield to the second cutting. Therefore
her strength failed, and the Surgeon took out a complete child, but it was
dead.

There are more Histories of live children cut Plin. lib. 7. hist. not. c. 90.
out of their mothers bellies being dead. And Roderick a Castro says that an
infant cannot live in the mothers womb being dead, except it be taken Rod. a
castro. lib. 4. de morbis mul. c. 1. A^gen. lib. 5. epit. 2. 11.
out at the very time of her departure, or while there are vital Spirits,
because when the motion and life of the mother cease, the life of the child
also cease: yet is his Argument of no force, because the child has its
proper Soul, and if it be well, it may live a while in the womb without bene^it
from the mother, as it does when it is delivered. But take heed it be not
suffocated in the womb, and keep the mothers mouth open, and let the Midwi^e
never move her hand from the privities, till the Surgeon have taken it Lib.

out: and you may know that the child is alive, when the mother is dead by its
leaping. Charles Step^ens shows the way of taking out a dead child.

When a live child is cut out of the belly of a live mother, it is done only
least the mother or child, or both should die.

And this may be done, and both preserved alive, which is plainly demonstrated
by Francis Rousset in his Book of this subject, so that there is In (...).
no doubt of it. For first he shows the necessity of the operation, and next
the possibility of it, showing that the muscles of the belly, the Peritonaeum
and womb may be cut without hazard of life.

Thirdly, he confirms by History what he proved by reason, and shows that many
wounds of the muscles in the lower belly, Peritonaeum and womb have been cured.

Fourthly, he propounds many more dangerous cases then the Caesarean Section,
which were not deadly in themselves. And then he shows the manner of the
operation, and how it is to be done. Therefore have recourse to his works, if
thou will learn it.

THE SEVENTH SECTION.
Of the Government of Women in Childbed, of the Diseases that come after
Travel.
Chap. 1 Of the Government of Women in Childbed.
PRESENTLY after she is delivered, labor to make the Afte^birth follow, of
which in the Chapter following, then compose her in bed, and give her good
food. Let the air be temperate, rather hot then cold. Let her beware of cold
that it get not into the womb, it will cause torments and inflammations.

If travel be hard, anoint the belly and ^ides with oil of sweet Almonds,
Lillies, and warm Wine.

Let her meat be of good juice and easy concoction, Hen broth, and Chickens,
and Capons, Kid, Mutton, Veal, let her drink thin wine i^ there be no fever,
or Cinnamon boiled in water, the first days drunk warm: Let there be no noise
about her, and let her not rise too soon, avoid passions least the humors be
stirred and ^^ll into some part.

If she cannot or will not suckle her child, turn the milk from the breasts by
repellers under the Armpits, as Unguent of Roses, Cerot of Sande^s, dissolved
in vinegar, and to the breasts apply a Cataplasm of Bean and Orobus flour with
Oxymel, or foment the breasts with the decocti^n of Mints, Dill, Smallage; or
lay the leaves bruised upon them.

Before she goes forth, let her bath with a decoction of Lilly roots,
Elicampane, Mug^o^t, Agrimony, Borage, Rosemary, Chamo^il flowers, Staechas,
Faenugreek, Lineseed, Citron peels.

Chap. 2. Of the Secundine or Afterbirth, or a Mole that is left after
Childbearing.
THese stick in the bottom of the womb, or like a ball to another part, the
mouth of ^he womb being open or closed.

It is not safe to cut the A^^erbirth from the The Causes
Navel till both be come forth, therefore draw i^ out without breaking of the
Navel string, this i^ retained because it grows to the sides of the womb, or is
swollen by hard travel, or because the Navel string is broken by the infants
straining: or from cold air got in, or from a fright^ or from her not having
throws fit to exclude it^ or because she is impatient and will not continu^ in a
due posture.

The Signs.
The Midwife will declare it, and the purgation is not, the belly swells, there
is a fever, and heaviness, and pain in the belly; there is a stink an^
loathing from stinking vapors, difficult breathing, Suffocation and Convulsion.

The Prognosti^k.
Many die from the retaining of it if it cannon come forth, when matter flows
from the womb there is hope that they will rot and come away in sixty days.

The Cure.
First let the Midwife draw it gently with he^ hand, and use sneesing, then
burnt Partridge feathers to the nose, and Goats hoofs, as in the suffocation of
the womb.

Then use things that expel a dead child, Di^tany, oil of wood Her^cleon after
Preparatives. Or, Take Marjoram, Chervil, Pennyroyal, each a handful; Savin
half a handful, Anise and Fennel seed, each half a dram; Lovage and Parsley
roots, each three drams; boil them in water for thr^^ draughts. Or, Take
Dittany, troches of Myrrh, Borax, each half a dram; Saffron, Castor, each a
scruple; make a Powder. Or, Take round Birthwort, two scruples, Myrrh a
scruple, make a Powder give it in Wine.

Make Pessaries of Mugwort, Mercury, Sage, Orris in powder with oil of Keir.
Or, Take round Birthwort, Savin, Briony, Ox gall and Hon^y, and make a Pessary.

The stronger are of the Decoction of wild Cowcumber, Coloquintida,
Staphisager, Hellebore, Honey, and gall of an Ox.

Fumes are made of Cassia lignea, Nard, Mugwort, Savin, Pennyroyal, Dittany.
Or, Take Mirrh, Castor, Galba^um, each half a dram; Opopanax, Cinnamon, each a
dram; with Honey make Troches for to be burnt.

Then ^oment the Belly with the Decoction of those Plants. Or, Take Lupine meal
an ounce, powder of Wormwood half an ounce, Mirrh, Rue, ^ach three drams; with
Ox gall and Honey make a C^taplasm.

If it come not forth, give a Womb-clyster of the Decoction of Sage, Mugwort,
Mercury, Calamints, Pennyroyal.

If all fail, inject things to suppurate into the womb, and let it be turned to
matter, and come out by degrees, and inject strengtheners into the womb.

Of the Mole lef^ after Childbearing.
You may know it by the signs of a Mole mentioned, she has no ease after
travel, there is pain in the navel, back and groyns, and much clotted blood
comes away, and yet she has no ease^ the Cure is mentioned before in the Mole.

Chap. 3. Of the Purgation after Childbearing diminished or detained.
THis is not alike in all women, for in some women the blo^d is fresh: in
others it is waterish, choleric, or melancholic. And some bleed more then
others, according to the constitution and Country. It is either not at all, o^
too much, or too little.

The Causes
When they are stopped or lessened, the vessels ar^ too strait, or the blood
flows another way, or i^ is too thick, or the vessels of the womb are pressed
from its position: the blood is drawn away by passions, fear, or goes hastily
to the brea^^s.

The Signs.
The just quantity is not to be de^ined: when it is stopped, the belly swells, the
pain is in the b^ttom of the b^lly and groyns; there is chilness and a fever
after it, ^ainting, weak, swi^t, unequal pulse; there is ^oot^ in the urin.
Sometimes the belly is inflamed, or she voids blew or black clodds of blood.

The Prognostic.
It is bad of it self to have any thing left after Childbearing, and worse if
it stays long, and Gal. 1. epid. com. 3. t^ 21.
grows melancholic: therefore it is a cause of many diseases.

First, endeavor to evaeuate the blood from the The Cure^^
womb by Frictions, Ligatures and Cupping; i^ they will not do, open a vein in
the foot.

Then open the pass^ges with external and internal means^ anoint the Belly with
loosning Oils, or soment thus. Take Lilly roots, Birthworts, Briony, Angel^ca,
each half an ounce; Mercury, Mugwort, Pennyroyal, Savin, Calamints, each a
handful; Tansey, Chamomil and Elder fl^wers, each half a handful; Faenugreek
and Linseed, each two drams; bruise them grossly, and put them in a bag, and
boil them in Water and Wine: lay it to the privities and bottom of the belly.

Give emollient Clysters; and if some days are pa^^, purge with Agarick,
Rhubarb, Senna. Or, Take Lilly roots, Al^haea, each half an ounce; Birthworts
two drams, Pellitory, Mercury^ Althiea, each a handful; Calamints. Chamomil,
Elder flo^ers, each two pugils; Faenugreek and Lineseed, each two drams; boil
them, to ten ounces strained, ^dd O^l of Dill, Lillies, each an ounce, Hiera
simple half an ounce, Ointment of Sowbread three drams make a Clyster.

Or give Pessaries that provoke the Terms.

Give things to melt and attenuate the blood. As, Take opening Roots three
drams, Bettony, Maidenhair, Endive, Schaenanth, each two pugils; Anise, Fennel
seed, each a scruple; red Pease a spoonful: boil them to a pint and half, add
Cinna^on water two drams, Syrup of the five Roots three ^^nces: give four
ounces.

and Convulsion. Therefore observe the pulse, least she die suddenly.

See what strength she has, and stopped it not ^^ddenly. I^ it be not very
g^^at, order a diet of The Cure.
^oas^ed Hens basted with red Wine, or Pomegra^^e, of Sta^ch, Almonds, Rice,
Quinces, Con^^^ve of Roses, steeled Water, and make Revul^^ns: use gentle
things, and strengthen the loose ^^^^ges.

Anoint the belly with oil of Roses, Mirtles, cup under ^he breasts and sides
without scari^ication. Apply a Cataplasm of red Roses, Bole and Ros^water to
the Liver.

Then use stronger, and give a higher diet often in small quantity, and give
Syrups to stop blood. As, Take old Conserve of Roses two ounces, of Tormentil
an ounce, of Quinces without speci^^ half an ounce, Bole, red Coral, each half
a dram; with syrup of Currants and Coral, make an Electua^y

Anoint the belly with the Ointment of the Countess, and other Astringents; or
use astringent Fomentations: or let her take into the womb a Fume of Mastich,
Frankincense, red Roses, etc.

Then open a vein in the arm, and let blood by degrees. See Sect. 2. Chap. 6.
of overflowing of the Terms.

Chap. 5. Of the Pains after Travel, and torments in the Belly.
THese are not in the body, and bottom of the womb, but in the vessels and
membranes by which the womb hangs, and that goes to the sides and belly.

The Causes
They are from a constant labor in travel, when the bottom of the womb is
pricked to send forth from cold air let into it, or clotted blood detained, or
sharp blood sticking to the womb, and pricking it.

The Signs.
They are in the womb it self, you may know i^ they came from cold by what has
been done, and clotted blood will manifest it self.

The Prognostic.
They we^ken much, and are very troubl^som, therefore they must be abated.

The Cure.
First, take away the cause, or abate the pain, and make that which hurts the
womb fit to be evacuated by these Pills.

Take Cinnamon a dram, Saffron a scruple, Dia^ymini, Diagalangal, Zedoary, each
half a dram; make a Powder, give a dram in Pennyroyal or Cinnamon water.

Or, Take of Cummin seed steept in Spirit of wine and dried again a dram, Ameos
s^eds and Ginger, each half a dram; Cinnamon a scruple, Castor half a scruple,
make a Powder. If she faint, ad Cordial Waters. As, Take Diacyminum a dram,
Diamargariton frigid, Citron pe^ls, Zedoary, each half ^ dram; make a Powder.

If she be choleric, or the humor thin and sharp, cure it as a Colic from
Choler. As, Take Syrup of Violets, Borage, each an ounce; Mucilage of Quince
seeds made with Violet water half an ounce water of Borage, Scorzonera, each
two ounces: give it at twice.

Extenuate the humors, and loosen the passages outwardly. Take Bean flour,
Faenugreek and Linseed, each an ounce; Chamomil flowers and Cummin seeds, each
half an ounce; boil them in Oil of Lillies for a Cataplasm.

You may sum the womb with Decoctions of Herbs.

Chap. 6. Of the tearing of the Vulva to the Arse, and coming forth of the
Womb, Inflammation, Ulcer, Suffocation, and falling out of the Fundament.
THe tearing i^ in hard travel, when the mothe^ Par. secti^ 1. c. 1.

The womb comes forth from the violent extraction Par. 1. sect. 2. cap. 15.
of the child or afterbirth, when the ligaments are stre^ched. The Cure is
mentioned, but you must not hinder the after flux by astringents, let her
therefore rest, and lie one her back, with her ^eet drawn up, with Sweets to
her nose, and stinks to the womb, so the womb will be retained, and the flux
continued; after this is past, you may use Astringents.

If there be inflammation from hard travel, hinder not the af^er-flux of blood
by Coolers.

If it turn to an ulcer, let the after-flux flow, and then cure it.

Suffocation after childbearing, is from the ^^inking after-blood, which sends
up stinking vapors which kill many. It is cured by Friction of the legs,
Ligatures and Cupping with Scarification, applying stinks to the nose, as
Castor, Partridg^eathers burnt, Rue. And applying Sweets to the privities.

You must cure the ^alling out of the Fundament from straining in Delivery, as
formerly showed.

Chap. 7. Of Watching, Doting, and Epilepsie of Women in Childbed.
THese are from the motion of the blood and hu^ors^ when the after-blood flows
not kindly^ and there is a ^eaver, of which in ^^e (...) Book. And from vapors
sent from the (...) there is an Epilepsie, which is cured by R^v^^sion o^
vapors and humors downwa^d^ and ^^^fect Evacuation of the a^ter-blood, which
done, all these Symptoms cease.

Chap. 8. Of the Swelling of the Womb, Belly, and Feet after Childbearing.
IT is commonly from cold gott^n into the womb, and the belly sometimes swells,
as if there were another child.

It is cured by hysterical or mother Fomentations, or with the skin of a new
^lain sheep, and hard wine, if in travel they keep a bad diet, or drink too
much, the humors go into wind, and if they fall into the legs they swel, then
take heed of much drink: and after the flux is past, make Evacuation with
things that expel wind. As, Take C^leworts and Chamomil, each as you please:
boil them in Wine, and ^ome^t the parts. Or, Take Wormw^^d, S^uthernwood,
Bettony^ Calamints, Organ, Chamomil flowers, Anis^eds, Rue, Caraway, as much as
will s^rve for a Fomentation for the feet.

Chap. 9. Of Vomiting, Looseness, Belly bound, and not holding of urin in women
in Childbed.
THey ^a^^ up crude and i^dig^sted meat somtime^, from weak^^^s of the stomach
by consent from the womb, or from the humors that Hipp. 1. de not. mulier.
(...) to the ^^^mach, from the parts near the womb, when the after flux does
not ^low, they sometimes vomit blood, or when it is disordered. For the blood
not getting out, goes to the great veins and liver, and in its hollow part, by
plenty and sharp it opens the veins, and it gets into the stomach. Sometimes a
vein is broken from hard travel.

Hip. 1. It is bad, of what cause ^oever it comes: for de morb. mulier.
the strength will ^ail, and there will be no ma^^er to make milk of^ if the
food be vomited. If other humors, they may cause a fever by their motion. If
blood be vomited from a vein of the liver broken or opened, a Dropsy is to be
feared; therefore stop it, whatsoever it be in this case. If it be of the meat,
give that which will be easily digested, that oppress not the stomach which
must be strengthened.

If bad humors are vomited up, stop it not so soon, but ^lense with gentle
Medicines, and ^pen the way by stool.

In vomiting of blood make Revulsion to the lower parts by rubbing, cupping
them, or bleeding in the ham or ankle, and provoke the afterflux.

The flux of the belly is dangerous if it be great, for it weakneth, and
threatens to bring a Dysentery, or Tenesmus^ or Needing. Nor is it safe to
stop it presently, least you stop the after-flux with it. If it be from food
not well concocted, let her keep a better diet, and let the stomach be
strengthened outwardly. If this will not do, give internal remedies, so that
they help the stomach^ and hurt not the womb, as the Decoction of Ba^ley, Syrup
and Honey of Roses. Give Clysters ^lso to temper the sharp humors^ and ^len^e.

Or give Syrup of Roses, Pulp ^f Tama^inds, or Rhuba^b. And A^^ingents of
Roses, Pl^ntan^, Torment^l, Quinces, Coral, and the like. If they be wholly
stopped, the belly must not be bound. But first give Rhubarb and Astringents
outwardly, and provokers of Terms.

Also the belly is bound in women in childbed, then give a Suppository of Soap
or Honey, and after four or five days, give emollient Clysters, and Manna or
Ca^^ia.

If they cannot hold their urin after hard travel, use a Bath of Bettony, Sage,
Bays, Rosemary^ Pennyroyal, Organ, Stoechas, and presently after anoint with
this. Take ^at Puppy-dogs ^oyled in Oil of Worms, Lillies, and Foxes till the
flesh fall from the bones, then take the Fat, and add Frankincense, Stora^
calamite, Benzoin, Opopanax, Mace, each a dram; Oil of Nutmegs by expression
^alf a dram, with Goose grease and Wax make an Ointment.

Chap. 10. Of the Wrinkles of the Belly after Childbearing, and mending of the
largeness of the Privities.
AFter the ^ourth month, Women prevent wrinkles by carrying a clout upon the
belly^ dipped in Oil of sweet Almonds, Jesamine, Oil of Lillies, to loosen the
skin, that it may stretch better without cle^^s.

If the belly be alreadly wrinkled. Take Sheeps (...) Goats ^^et, Oil of sweet
Almonds, each an ounce; Sperma C^^^ two drams, with Wax make an O^ntment. After
the flux is past^ add O^l of (...) T^^rabi^. 4 ^^rm. 4.
or R^s^s, or make Aeti^s his Cataplasm.

Chap. 11. Of Fevers and acute diseases in Women in childbed.
THey have often continual Fevers. The ^^^st is th Fever of milk about the
fourth or third day from the motion of the blood from the womb to the breasts;
it is not of many days and continuance, and is not dangerous.

But take heed you mistake not a putrid ^eaver for a milk-^eaver, for labor
and pain sometimes inflame the humors, and cause putr^^action, and though the
Symptoms appear not the next day after delivery, yet there may be the
beginning of putre^action from the heat of the humors in ^ravel^ especially if
the after-flux be stopped, from which time you must count the beginning of the
diseases. For a fever cannot be long concealed, nor the motion from travel
last long: therefore it is probable the motion is ceased, and the ^eaver comes
of another cause, which I shall decla^e presently.

The Causes
They are the sto^page of the after-flux, or the diminishing of it, or the ^oul
humors that were gathered in the time of being with ch^ld, and stirred ^n
travel. Too great purging of the af^e^blood or Lochia signifies Cacochymy, or a
Fever that will come long after travel. If the Lochia Hipp. 1. epid. tex. 21.
^low not in due time, or be stopped, then the blood and ^oul humo^s go back to
the great veins and liver, and make a putrid Fever, or inflame those parts.

The Signs.
A Fever from milk comes the fourth day, and t^ere is heaviness ^f back and
shoulders, and the Lochia flow well, if not, there is the sign of a ^^ver. If
the humors putri^ie in the womb^ there is ^oul stinking matter voided, the
belly is swollen, and is pained when touch^. If the fever be not from milk,
and the Lochia ^low, it comes from bad humors, especially if when she was big
with child^ she kept not a good diet.

A Fever from milk is without danger, and The Prognostic.
cease the eighth or tenth day: that which comes from suppression of the
Lochia or after-flux, is dangerous and often deadly, except there follow a flux
of the belly. If black stinking matter ^low from the womb, they escape If the
fever come from a Cacochymy before Delivery, it is worse, because it argues
much humors, which Nature cannot discharge by the after-flux, and the strength
is dejected by hard travel.

A Fever from milk, requires only good diet, The Cu^^^
and sweating must not be hindered, for it cures. That which is from stoppage
or diminishing of the Lochia, must be cured by provoking the after-flux, or by
another evacuatio^ instead of it: as purging, bleeding in the ^oot to provoke
the flux or by ^carifying of the thighs and legs, after cupping, while the time
is, that the after flux should ^e not afterward. For if that time be past, if
^^rength permit, open a vein in the arm, and bleed plentifully.

For purging: some purge them in a Pleurisy after the seventh day, but beware
by reason of Valor. lib. 5. obs. 10. merc. 4 de morb. m^l^ c. 11.
the weakness after travel, and because Purges may hinder the after flux, which
is dangerous, it is good to evacuate only by the womb; but if the flux of
blood cease, and Nature would pu^ge something from the womb, you may give a
gentle Purge of Rhubarb, Cassia, Manna, Syrup of Roses, Senna.

Alterers are thus to be ordered. Avoid too cold and sharp things, le^t the
evacuation by the womb should de di^^urbed by cold things.

Let it be thin the first days of lying in, then T^^ Diet.
thicker, and so increasing, take heed of too much drink, especially of cold
drink.

Question. What Veins are to be opened in women that lie in, and have a
Pleurisy?
They have Symptomatical ^eavers; also from in^^ammation of the Pleura, Jaws or
Liver, because some of the ^oul humors are sent to some private part, and makes
an inflammation to which the ^eaver is joined, and the causes are as before
mentioned.

If there be a Pleuri^ie, she is in great danger. The question is whether she
must bleed above or below, I say thus. First, this ^eaver is not properly
Symptomatical, but primary, and has the inflammation its associate, while
Nature sends part of the matter to the Pleura or other part.

Secondly note, that Nature is in an er^or while she sends the vicious humors,
which she should expel by the womb to the Pleura.

Thirdly note, that the vicious mo^ion of Nature is not to be helped therefore,
which should be done if you should presently open a vein in the arm; but the
blood is to be voided by the womb, which is Natures way.

Fourthly, i^ the Pleuri^ie be not abated by o^ening a vein in the a^kle for
revulsion, but the Symp^oms continue or increase, you must not continue to open
the veins beneath, because they evacuate not from the part affected, which is
ne^ess^ry in such a dangerous disease. It is a sign that the matter is fastened
to the part, that it cannot again be brought to the womb by revulsion.
Therefore then you may open a vein in the arm on the same side, to evacuate and
derive the blood from the part or there about, or she will be in danger of
death.

And fear not, that Nature will be taken from her ordinary motion toward the
womb thereby, for the vein that was opened in the foot, prevented that: and if
you fear any danger, you may prevent it by Frictions and cupping of the legs,
while you let blood in the arm.

And you may give Clysters, that may cause the humors moving upwards, to come
down, and loosen the passages of the womb, that blood may flow out the better.

As, Take Pellitory of the Wall, Mallows, Althaea, red Coleworts, each a
handful; Chamomil^^owers half a handful, Faenugreek and Linseed, each half an
ounce; boil them in Water, to a pint strained, add lenitive Electuary an ounce,
Diacatholicon or Cassia half an ounce, Oil of Violets two ounces, make a
Clyster.

If the Fever abate, and the time of the flux of the Lochia be past, give a
gentle Purge.

Cure the rest as an ordinary Pleurisy, only take heed that while the
after-flux lasts, you give no binding Medicine.

Also she may have a Quinzie while she lies in, while the vicious matter flows
to the jaws. The ^ure of which bleeding is to be done as in the Pleuris^e, but
the rest is to be done as in the Quin^^ie.

And if the Liver be inflamed by the motion of the humors to it, you must bleed
as in the Pleurisy and Quinzie. Yet it is not so needful in the arm as in the
Pleuri^ie, by reason of the greater distance of the Liver from the arm, for the
Pleura and the breast are nearer, and consent more with the arms, but the vein
in the leg^ is near to the hollow vein, as the distribution of the upper veins
to the arms.

The rest of the Cure of the inflammation ^f the Liver, is in Lib. 3. only
observe that you must not use too great Coolers or Binders in women in
Childbed, but things that are of thin parts, least the flux called Lochia or
after-blood, should be stopped.

THE THIRD PART.
Of the Diseases of Women's Breasts.
THE FIRST SECTION.
Of Diseases of the Breasts.
Chap. 1. Of the increased number of Breasts, and gr^atness extraordinary.
THOUGH Nature has ordained Card. l. 8. c. 43. de r^rum variet Cabrol. obs. 7.
two in all women: yet some have Breasts like men: others have had two on each
side that had milk.

The figure of the Breasts is round pointed at the nipple a little, it ought
not to be soft nor hard, and of an indifferent bigness, and it is better they
be indifferent, though they hold not so much milk, least they be subject to
C^n^ers and in^lammations, and when they are too big, they have not a temperate
heat.

The Causes of overgreat Breasts, is much blood, and the ^^^ength of heat
attracting and ^onco^ting it; these are remote causes, but the immedi^te cause
is the la^geness of the passages and looseness, which is in the first

handling of the Breasts by which the blood and the heat is drawn to the Breasts.

then to abate them when too big: with good diet and Topics that repel by
cooling, and binding and drying. As, Take Myrtle leaves^ Horstayl, Plantane,
Mints, red Roses, each a handful; Pomegranate flowers two pugil^: boil them in
red Wine and Vinegar, and with a Sponge apply it to the breasts^ and let it
dry: or apply Hemlo^k bruised with Vinegar. Or, Take powder of Com^r^^roots two
drams, Pom^granate flowers, red R^^^s, Frankincense, Mastich, each half an
ounce; ^^^ley ^^our, red Oakre, each an ounce and half; with Rose-wat^^, the
white of an E^, and ^ little Vineg^r make a Cataplasme. These may be laid to
the Breasts, and under the arm-pi^s, to astringe the vessels, and hinder the
blood from flowing to them.

Hemlock, Henbane, and other Narcoticks are forbidden, because they weaken the
natural heat and hinder the breeding of milk.

Dryers and Discussers are good in women that have great Breasts after weaning,
to consume the moisture. As, Take Bean and Orobus meal, each tw^ ounces and
half; Com^rey roots in powder half an ounce, Mints three drams, Wormwood,
Chamomil fl^wers an^ Roses, ea^h two drams: boil, and add two ounces of Oil of
Mastich, make a Cata^lasme.

The Breasts are too little, when the flux of blood to the Breasts, is
hindered, diminished, intercepted, revelled, or turned another way, or when the
blood is not drawn by the Breasts, as in a dry Liver-famine, much labor, or in
watchings, fevers, and other diseases that consume the body. The same is when
the radical moisture of the Breasts is con^umed.

You must remove the cause that breeds it, and ^^ten friction will attract
blood, and foment with warm water, in which Emollients have been boyl^d with
white Wine, and then anoint with Oil of sweet Almonds, or of Indian-nuts.

Looseness of the Breasts is cured by astringents.

Chap. 2. Of Swelling of the Breasts with Milk.
When the milk carrying veins are too full, the Breasts swell all over, or in

the child will draw them, or a Puppy. Or use a Glass to su^k with: they which
will not give suck, may use this. Take Barley meal of Lentils, Althaea roots,
Chamomil flowers and Mints, each half an ounce; Agnus castus seeds two
s^ruples: boil them in Wine, ad a little Vinegar, Oil of Dill two ounces, make
a Cataplasme.

Chap. 3. Of Inflammation and Erysipelas of the Breasts.
Sometimes the tumor in the Breast is inflamed from blood, for though plenty of
milk cause an inflammation, blood is the immediate cause, for milk as it
corrupts and grows hot, increases pain, and so the blood staying in the fmal
capillar veins, being out of the vessels, is hot, putrid and inflamed. There
are other causes, as strokes^ falls, straitness of clothes, and other hurts of
the Breasts.

A hard and red swelling shows inflammation The Signs.
with beating pain, and a Fever.

These inflammations are commonly without The Prognostic.
danger, but because the Breasts are so loose, and have many kernels, and
little heat, they turn to Cancers and Scirrhus.

If you fear a great flux of blood that will increase The Cure.
the inflammation, let blood in a plethorick b^dy. But if it come from stopping
o^ the ^^rms or after flux, first open the vein in the ankle, and s^arifie the
legs, then (if need be) ^pen the arm.

If bad humors coming to the Breasts, nourish the inflammation, give a gentle
Purge of Manna, Senna, and the like. If the blood be too hot, or mixed with hot
humors that help the motion o^ the blood. Use Alterers, as Lettice, Endive,
^urslane, Plantane, Waterlillies, and the like.

To be a skilful Physician study my S^nnertus, Platerus, Riverius, Bartholinus,
and Riolanus, of the last Editions.
Use Repellers after these, but such as are weak and not too cold, as a clout
dipped in Water and Honey, with Oil of Roses applied to the breasts. Or^ Take
Lettice, Purslane, each a handful; red R^s^s half a handful: boil them in
Water, add Vi^^gar two ounces, make an Epithem.

Or^ Take Nightsh^de, Lettice, each a handful: b^yl them, stamp them, and ad
B^rley meal two oun^s, powder of Chamomil flowers half an ounce, Oxym^l, Oil of
Roses, each a dram; make a Cataplasm.

When the beginning of the inflammation is past, ad Discussers with your
Repellers. As, Take white Bread crumbs, Barley flour, each an ounce and h^l^;
Bean and Foenugreek flower, each half an ounce; powder of red Rose^ and
Chamomil flowers, ^^ch two drams: boil them, add Rose-vinegar an ^unce, Oil of
Roses and of Chamomil, each an ounce; make a Cataplasm.

At length use only Dis^ussers. A^^ Take Bean (...) and of Lupines, and of
Faenugreek, and (...) and powder of Chamomil flowers, each an ounce; ma^e a
Cataplasm.

If the matter grow hard, use Emollients and (...) As, Take Mallow^ a handful

powder of Althaea roots two ounces, powder of Line and Faenugreek seeds, each

Cataplasm.

When t^ere is matter, and the imposthumes breaks of its own accord, it is
well, otherwise open it with a Lancet or some sharp Medi^ine, and let out the
matter, and then cleanse it thus. T^ke Turpentine, Honey of Roses, each an
ounce; Mirrh a scruple. The ulcer will be hard to be cured, except you dry up
the milk in the other Breast, by reason of much blood that will flow thither to
breed milk.

Question. Whether the Inflammation of the Breasts be from blood alone, or from
milk also^
The inflammation and swelling in women in Childbed upon their Breasts, is
from the a^^lux of too much milk, and it is with redness and pain, and beating
or pulsation: and it is not only from blood, for tumors (as in other parts) a^e
seldom pure or unmixed, but there are other humors with it. Therefore it is
certain, that when blood is drawn by heat or pain, or comes of i^ self to the
Breasts, and begins to corrupt, the milk also may be corrupted.

Of the Erysipelas of the Breasts.
This Erysipelas is from fright or ang^r, and i^ turns presently to a Phlegmon,
and is cured as the inflammation of the Breast.

Lay no cold astringent Repellers, or f^t things^ but things that sweat, as
Hartshorn, seal^d Earth, Carduus must be given with El^er water^ to discuss
the thin blood that causes the inflammation. Apply outwardly hot a Pledg^t
dipped in Elder-water.

is from a Cachexy or want of Terms, they must first be removed: then use
Topics that discuss, and ^^solv^, and strengthen, let them be but temperately
hot, least you discuss the thin, and leave the thick, which will cause a
Scirrhus.

Make therefore Fomentations of a Lixivium of Vine and Colewort ashes, and
Sulphur, or a Decoction of Hysop, Sage, Organ, Chamomilflowers. Then anoint
with Oil of Chamomil, Lillies, Bays. Or, Take Barley flour four oun^^^, of
Lineseeds, Faenugreek, Dill, Chamomil flo^^^s, each half an ounce; A^thaea
root^ an ounce, with Oil of Chamomil and Dill make a Cataplasm.

Chap. 5. Of the Scirrhus of the Breasts.
IT is a hard tumor without pain, from mel^ncholy gathered in the veins that
flows to the Breast; or it is thick phlegm dried. Sometimes both humors are
mixed together, or more, which makes a bastard Scirrhus. And if burnt humors
abound most, it turns to a Cancer: and if melancholy be most, it is not a
Scirrhus, but a Cancer.

There are two signs of a true Scirrhus, hardness The Signs.
and want of pain, if it be fixed. I^ is sometimes white, sometimes black or
blew, as the humor is. If it be a bastard Scirrhus, there is heat and pain; and
if they increase, it turns to a Cancer, and the veins grow blew about, and
begin to swell.

it is to be cured. If hairs grow upon a Scirrhus, it is incurable, and it
easily turns to a Cancer.

from the womb, or the whole body, let the containing cause be softened, made
thin, and discussed. But beware of two things. First, that the thin parts be
not discussed by too hot medicines, and the thick left, for so it will be
incurable, and as hard as a stone. Secondly, that you ^erment not the matter by
moistning Emollients, so that it turn to a Cancer.

The Ancients either used none, or a dry^ng or a moistning Medi^ine only. You
must either use Moistners and Emollients with Digesters by turns, or mixed.

If it be a bastard Scirrhus^ you may fear a Cancer. Then after Universa^s and
bleeding, take away the disposition of the bowels that breeds black humors.

If you fear a flux of humors, use oil of Roses, and juice of Plantane; and if
there be heat, stir them first in a Leaden mortar, till they change their

The Breasts are spungy and loose, and therefore The Causes
Cancers breed often there, but the Cause is from the womb, when they are of a
hot and dry constitution with burnt blood, and when the terms st^p, and then

and grows up by degrees, and spreads out roots with veins about it. And when
the skin is eaten through, it is a stinking ulcer, and the lips are hard, and
the matter black.

It is hard or never cured, because the black humor The Prognostic.
that causes it, is very troublesome, and has a peculiar malignity, which is
fermented, and made worse with Emollients and Suppuraters, which loosen the
vessels, and dilate them, so that the humor flows easier to the part, and the
corrupt humors get easier to the parts adjacent, and infect them.

A Cancer not ulcerated, is to be let alone, by The Cure.
the counsel of Hippocrates. But let blood, and purge melancholy often. But use
no Topics that may rot or provoke the part, but things that by experience take
away pain; as Nightshadewater, Snails boiled and Frogs in Oil and with ashes of
Frogs made into an Ointment, or Medicines of Lead.

As, Take Oil of Roses two ounces, juice of Nightshade berries an ounce and
half, Ceruss wash^d, Sugar of Lead, each a dram; Pompholygos half an ^unce, mix
them in a Leaden mortar, till they a^e thick.

Or use Craysi^h ashes, and the ashes of the inward ward rind of an Ash-tree,

Arcaeus teaches how to cut them out, and then burn the part, if they be deep
and ulcerated. But Fabri^ius shows that you must burn after to consume the
relics, and stop the blood: after it is ^lensed; Take Herb Robert, Verbascum

After cutting out the root, purge melancholy often, and provoke terms or
Haemorrhoids, least it return.

Give Treacle, Mithridate^ with juice of Bo^age, Sorrel, Craysish broth, and

Of the Symptoms of the Breasts.
Chap. 1. Of want of Milk, and not giving of suck.
THERE are many C^uses of want of milk, either there is little blood to breed
it, or the milk making faculty in the breast that makes milk, is not right, or
the instruments for blood-making are distempered.

Sometimes the matter is consumed by a s^aver or fasting, when they loath meat,
or from care or labor, evacuations, sweats, or loose belly. Or from weakness
of the infant that cannot draw hard. Also sadness, fear, and the like, may
hinder blood from flowing to the breasts.

Milk is wanting when the breasts are flaggie, The Signs.
and swell not, and little milk is sucked out. The signs of the causes, thus If
it be from the liver, there will be signs of its distemper: if from great
eva^uation, that is known: the fault is known to be in the breasts, if as often
as they lie in, they have no milk and the breasts are ^^^al and wrinkled; or if
Medicines to keep down the breasts, have been applied, she will tell you: or if
it be from weakness of the child or passions of mind.

The inconvenience is little to the Nurse, but The Pr^gnostick.

and good blood, of easy concoction. Medicines to b^eed milk, are Fennel roots
and all green, and thin^s that heat, and are not very dry, which a^e few, but
in^inite are they that hinder milk, as things hot and dry, and cold things.

These increase milk, roots of Smallage, seeds of Parsl^y, Dill, Basil, Anise,
Rocket, Earthworms washed in juice of Fennel and d^ied, or burnt in a Ans.

pot a dram, or two fasting for some mornings, or Cr^st^l or Milk-stone a dram.

Compounds are: Take green Fennel, Parsley, each a handful; Barley two pugils,
red Pease half an ounce: boil them, and with Sugar swee^en them, or in Chi^ken
broth. Or,

Take green Fennel six drams, Barley two pugils, boil them in broth, and
strain them. Or, Take Fennel seed six drams, Anise a dram and half, Rocket seed
half a dram: give a dram or two in Broth.

Or, Take Cows Udder sliced, dry it in an Oven, and powder it. Take half a
pound of it, Anise, Fennel seed, each an ounce; Cummin seed two ounces, Sugar
four ounces, make a Powder.

Hot Fomentations open the breast, and attract blood, as the Decoction of
Fennel, Smallage, or stamped Mints applied. Or, Take Fennel and Parsley green,
each a handful; boil and stamp them, a^ ^arley meal half an ounce, Gith seed a
dram, Storax calamite two drams, Oil of Lillies two ounces, make a Pultis.

A Dropax and Synapisme, or Plaster of Mustard, are good if often changed.

Chap. 2. Of too much Milk.
THis is when much blood flows to the breasts, and the mother will not give
suck, or weans the child, for the infant cannot suck it as fast as it breeds,
when there is much blood, and good breasts that can make Milk.

If Milk be kept, and cannot be su^ked out by The Prognostic.

pains, curdlings, and corruption. Children that suck much, if they be full
bodied, have a Convulsion.

The first coming of Milk is not to be stopped, The Cure.
but when there is more then the child can suck, it is abated with a slender
diet of little nourishment, as Barley, Pot Herbs water. By letting blood, or
cupping, or by Repellers to the veins under the arms, above the breasts.

Mints, Calamints, Smallage, Agnus castus, Coriander, Hemlock: to abate Milk,
Mints and Smallage are doubted.

Compounds. Take Smallage, Mints, Mallows, Mercur. Plat. Dioscor. dissentiunt.

Vinegar, and with a Sponge foment.

They which will not give suck, let them foment with this Decoction. Take
Mallow^, ^ays, Fennel, Smallage, Parsley, Mints, each half a handful; anoint
after with Oil Ompha^ine. Then Take Turpentine washed with Wine and Rose Water
three ^unces, Eggs two or three, Saffron a scruple, with Wax make a Plaster,
with a hole in the middle, repeat it always before Supper.

If you fear inflammation by too great a flux of Milk, repel with a Cataplasin
of Lettice, Wa^e^lillies, Poppies, Housl^^k. Or, Take Turpentine washed with
Mint water three ounces, Cummin seed, Orris, Mints, each half an ounce; Saffron
^s^r^ple, with Wax make a Cerot.

Chap. 3. Of Curdling, and other faults in the Milk.
IF it stay long in the breasts, the thin evapo^^tes, and the thick remains,

Syrup of the two Roots and Oxym^l, each two ounces.

Foment with the Decoction of Fennel, Dill, Southernwood, Chamomil, Melilot
flowers, Fenugreek, Lineseed, Parsley seed, Smallage, or stamp them, or Mints
with Butter, and apply it. If it be hard, Take Mints, Coleworts, Bran, each a
handful: boil them in Vinegar, and apply them.

Or, Take juice of Smallage, Dill, Coleworts, each a handful: boil the^ soft,

not speak of the Terms, but of other blood that is hot, and flies to the hot,

inflammation, which shows madness at hand.

The pain in the breasts, is from stretching by much milk, and inflammation: or
from corrosion and twitching, from sharp matter, as in the Cancer and other
Ulcers.

The cause of the pain is known from the distemper. If it be from much milk, it
is a gentle pain. If from inflammation, it is stronger. If from a Cancer, it is
very great.

How these pains are cured, is showed in their Chapters.

A TRACTATE Of the Cure of Infants.
THE FIRST PART.
Of the Diet and Government of Infants.
Chap. 1. Of the choice of the Nurse.
THE blood that nourished the child in the womb, is turned into milk to nourish
him after he is born, because he can eat no solid meats. And because from
weakn^ss or a disease, the mother sometimes cannot suckle her child, she must
have a Nurse of good habit of body, and red complexion, which is the sign of
the best temper; and let her not differ much from the temper of the mother,
unless it be for the better: let her be between twenty and thi^ty, well b^ed,
and peaceable, not angry, melancholy, or soolish, not lecherous, nor a
drunkard. Let it not be after her first child, and let not her milk be too old
or too new^ o^ ten months old at the most. Let her breasts be well fashioned
with go^d Nipples, that the child may take them with pleasure.

Let her keep a good diet, and abstain sro^ hard wine and copulation, and
passions: these chiefly trouble the milk, and bring diseases upon the child. If
there be a bad humor from high ^eeding in the Nurse, let her take a gentle
Purge when she gives not suck, except the child be to be purged by the same.

Question. Whether is an Infant better nourished by the Mother or by a Nurse?
Some say by a Nurse: others say the Mothers milk is more like the nour^shment
it had in the womb, which is best, except she have a disease. For he that gave
her strength to conceive, travel, and bring forth, will give her strength to
play the Nurse, though she be weak. And honest women will be very obedient to
directions, for the good Lib. 12. c. 1.
of the child they love so dea^ly: of which P^a^^rinus.

Chap. 2. Of the Conditions of good Milk.
IT must be neither too thick nor too thin, for too thick cannot be concocted,
and the thin argues crudities. If it be dropped upon the nail, or a glass, and
falls not e^sily off as water; if it sti^k too fast, it is too think.

Let the color be while, the more it differs from that, the worse it is. Let
it be sweet, not four, ^alt, or bitter, or (...) Let i^ neither smell burnt or
so^, for then it will easily corrupt in the stomach of the child.

Chap. 3. Of curing the faults in Milk.
THe usual fault, is when it i^ too thi^ by r^ason of plenty of S^rum in the
blood^ this nou^isheth little: and mak^s lean ^hild^^n that sall into a
Diarrhaea or Belly flux. If it be too sharp, they are scabby.

with Anise and Fennel seed, roast the meat, and give Rice and sweet Almonds:
avoid Fish, Sallets, Summer-fruits, much Bro^h, use often ^xercise, and purge
Serum or Whey, with Sy^^p of Roses, and Mechoacan, or R^ubarb, if i^ (...) hot
or choleric.

If ^^ro^s humors come from the dist^mper of the Liver, amend that, and let
cold and mo^^^ (...) be am^nded with things hot and d^y.

Of thick Milk.
It is from gross diet and drink, or from a hot and dry distemper in the
breasts, that burns up the thin blood.

Give flesh of good juice, and easy concoction, The Cure.
as Chickens, Kid, Veal, abstain from gross food; use moistners and
attenuaters, and if there be thick humors with the blood, let them be evacuated.

Of the sharpness, ill taste, scent and color of the Milk.
There are diverse tastes, scents and colors in milk from variety of diet.
Therefore let a Nurse take heed of fried Onions, and all four, salt and spiced
meats: and let her eat Sallets and Rhadishes, and the like. Let her not be
passionate. Milk also is sometimes falt, sharp, choleric, and m^lancholick.

This breeds dangerous diseases, as wringing in the belly, flux, watching,
leanness, trush, and falling-si^kness.

Correct the blood, and keep a good diet, beware The Cure.
of things that corrupt the milk, as sharp, ^alt things: avoid anger, and other
passions, and Venery. Good Wine moderately, taken by such as have used it,
takes away the ill scent from milk.

If these will not do, purge the Cacochymy or evil ^uyces, with Medicines
proper for the humors offending.

Chap. 4. Of the Diet and Government of newborn Children.
THe best color in a newborn child, is redness all over the body, that
changes by degrees to a Rose-colour; they who are white, are s^^kly, and short
lived. It must cry clear and loud, which shows the strength of the breast.
Observe all the parts, and ^igure, and passages diligently: let the Midwise
handle it gently. Roll it up with soft clothes, and lay it in a cradle, and
wash it first with warm wine; give it a little honey before it sucks, or a
little Oil of sweet Almonds newly drawn, that if there be any filth contracted
in the stomach from the womb it may be cleansed, for there is a black matter
yellowish in the guts, which if not voided, will cause an Epilepsie.

Keep it from cold air, and not too hot; nor in too great light, set not a
candle behind it at the head, nor let it see the Sun^ least it be squintey'd.
Let it not be frighted, nor left alone sleeping or waking, least it receive
hurt.

Let it sleep long, carried in the arms often, and give it the dug, but ^ill
not too much his stomach with milk. After four months, ^oos^n the arms, but not
the belly, and breast, and ^eet, but keep them rouled from cold above a year.
Let it be often cleansed from the excrements of the belly and bladder, least
they cause itching, o^ pain, or excoriation.

A little crying empties the brain, and (...) the lungs, and sti^s up natur^l
(...) it not cry too much, for to prevent Catarrhs and Ruptures^ but it does
least hurt^ before sucking, and a^te^ ^onco^tion.

The ^i^st months, let it only suck as often as it will, ^o the stomach be not
over ^harged. Give it change of breasts, sometimes the right sometimes the le^t.
Afterward make Pap of Barley bread ^^e^pt in water, and boiled in Milk. Let
strong children have it b^times, and not suck an hou^ after, thus it must be
nourisht til it breeds teeth.

Chap. 5. Of the Diet of an Infant from breeding of Teeth, til it be weaned.
WHen the teeth come forth, by degrees give it more solid food, and deny it ^ot
milk, such as are easily chewed. When it is st^onger, let it not stand too
soon, but be held by the Nurse, or put into a go-chair, that it may thrust
fo^ward it self, and not fall.

In pla^es where bathing of children is used, (...) it be wash^d twice a week,

They have other diseases at other times, as Mea^les, small Pox, the ligament

In the Cure, use not strong Remedies, nor bleeding, not purging, but
Suppositories and Clysters As, Take Violet leaves, Mallows, each a handful;
flowers of Chamomil and Violets each a pugil: boil them, to four or five ounces
strained, ad Syrup of Roses half an ounce, or six drams, Oil of Violets half an

If it need other Physic, give it to the Nurse, for the purging ^orce is sent
to the milk, as Hippocrates 6. Epid. c. 6.
^aith, If a Woman take Elaterium or wild Cowcumbers, the Child is purged; but
you must not give these to the Nurse, but gentle things will purge the in^ant,
if the Nurse take them.

Emulsions of the four great cold Seeds, Barley cream. Give no Wine while the
child is in a fever. Purge the Nurse gently, with Manna, Cassia, Lenitive
Electuary, and Syrup of Roses.

Give Alterers to the insant, as Syrup of Viol^ts, Sorrel, Citrons, Succory,
Endive water, and of V^olet with Sugar.

Anoint the Backbone with Mucilage of Quin^^s, ^leabane, with Oil of Violets
and a little Wax, lay Astringents to the Stomach. As, Take Oil of Roses,
Mastich, each half an ounce; red Sander^, Coral, each a scruple; with Wax mix
it.

If the fever come from breeding of it, abate the pain, and give the Alterers,
of which Chap. 14. of Bleeding of Teeth.

Of Meazles and small Pox.
There are Epidemical fevers at certain times Lib. 4 de ^ebr. c. 12.
that cast out Meazles and small Pox, of which before. The cause is not only
from the impurity of the terms, but from the malignity of the air, for they are
more or less, as the air is purer or impurer.

Sometimes it is infectious, and the humors are so co^rupt, that worms breed
under the scabs and corrode the bones and internal parts, as has been seen in
bodies opened, dead of this disease.

If the disease be very infectious, before there is a ^eaver, it is good to
preserve by change of air and Antidotes, when many die of it, but when few die,
it is not amiss to let them alone, lea^^ they have it in a more dangerous time,
for most will have it: only give a gentle Purge, and ^ortifie Nature, that she
may better expel them.

If there be a ^eaver, use no more Preservatives, ^ut labor to get them forth
by Medicines mentioned, and defend the eyes and throat, and ^^event deformity,

Chap. 3. Of the Milkey Scab, Achores, and Favi.
THe milkey Scab is at the first sucking, the Acho^es are after. The Achores
are scabs not white, and the white scab is not only in the face, but all over
the body. The Achores are only in the head, but they are cured alike.

They are all ulcers chiefly in the head, with hol^s that run with matter
constantly.

They come from excrementitious humors, waterish The Causes

Cordials. Use no Coolers nor Astringents, least the matter be stroke in. Let
the Nurse forbear salt and sharp, and spiced things, and strong Wine. Pepare
the humors with Borage, S^^^ory, Buglo^s, Fumit^^y, Hops, Polypody and Dock
roots. Then purge with Senna, Polypody, Epithymum, Rhu^^^b, and strengthen the
Bowels. As, Take Conserve of Borage, Bugloss, Violets, Fumit^ry, Succory, each
an ounce; Succory roots, and Citrons candied, each half an ounce; Diarrhodon,
Diamargartion ^rigid, Hartshorn, each a s^ruple; with (...) o^^ G^^^i-^^o^^rs

Hartshorn prepared two drams, Mag^stery of Coral a dram, Diamargariton frigid
half a dram: give half a dram, or a dram of this Powder. Let the child be
purged with Manna or Raisons laxative.

If you fear great putrefaction under the scabs, and that will turn to a scald
head, or eat the skul; wash the head with Decoction of Mallows, Barley,
Celandine, Wormwood, or with Althaearoots boiled in Boys urine, and Barley
water. And then anoint with Oil of Roses, bitter Almonds, and a little
Litharge. Or,

Take ashes of Mirtles and Nut shells, each a dram; Tutty a dram and half,
Butter washed with Rose Water an ounce. Or, Take juice of Beets, Celandine,
each an ounce; Hogs grease two ounces, Sulphur a dram. Or, Take Cer^ss,
Litharge, each two drams; Pomegranate flowers and Agarick, e^ch a dram; with
Oil of Roses and Vinegar, make an Ointment: or wash with Soap, and then with
the Decoction. When the skull is bare, use Honey of Roses and Spirit of Wine,
and after round Birthwort, and Balsom of Peru, and Turpentine with Tobacco
water.

grease upon Beet or Colewort leaves. Or, Take juice of Fumitory, Coleworts,
Docks, Elicamp^ne, each an ^unce and half; Litharge half an ounce, with Hogs
grease, oil of Rue, and Wax, make a sof^ Oymment.

When the Child is of age and strong, make first universal ev^^uation with
Senna, Rhubarb, Agarick, then take off the Scab with Sulphur two drams, Mustard

Turpentine half an ounce, and Bears grease. Or beat Watercresses with Hogs

After the scab is off, pull the hair out by the roots, with instruments or
medicines; commonly they use a pitched cap, and pull it off violently which
brings away the hair. Or, Take Starch or Wheat flour two ounces, Rosin half an
ounce, boil it in water for a Pultis, lay it upon the several S^ald^ and let it
stick some days, then pluck it off suddenly. Then use Emollients that correct
the dry distemper.

Also use things to take the excrements out that lie deep in the skin. As, Take
roots of Althaea, Docks, Lillies, each an ounce; Mallows, Fumitory, Sage, each
two handful; boil them in Li^, add Vinegar, wash the head with it every day

Take Ostratium, Sulphur, each half an ounce; oil of Eggs an ounce with Hogs

Then use Tarr and Wax for a Cerot. Or^ Take Sal^-p^ter an ounce, Oxymel an
ounce and half. Or, Take quick Brimstone an ounce, whi^^ H^llebore,
Staphisacre, each two drams, with Hogs grease.

It is not safe to use Arsenick, or O^piment, or Mercury, or other poys^ns that

Chap. 5. Of Ptiriasis or breeding of Lice.
LIce are creatures which breed in clothes that are constantly worn, but they
are chiefly in children from the excrements of the head.

All say, that filth and nastiness alone is the cause of lice, but I think not
so, for filth alone cannot do it without heat, for besides the first qualities
there is a hidden force in the matter by which it is disposed to produce a
particular species; for fleas and worms will not breed of that matter which
breeds lice, so it is in Plants.

Heat is the helping cause which raises the seminal force, and brings it into
act, and though the matter be putrid it does not wo^k upon it, but as it is
somewhat natural.

Excrements are not presently putrid, but there is in them a heat that can
raise forming force, and though there is some putrefaction, yet is it not so
great as to hinder the action, hence it is that children and women that are hot
and moist have many excrements that are fit to breed lice.

Some meats breed lice, as Figs by their fat Gal oriba. Ausc.

them ^reed all over the body, and some have died by them. Sometimes the lice
leave them when they are about to die.

To prevent breeding lice, let children eat no food of evil juice, especially
Figs, let the head be often combed and washed, and the matter purged that
breeds them, with hot dry thin medicines, that draw the matter out and consume
superfluous moisture.

The Cure.
Take heed of Mercury and Arsnick in children but make this Lotion Take round
Birthwort, Lupines, Pine and Cypress leaves, each equal parts; boil them. Or,
Take Elicampane roots two ounces, Briony half an ounce, Beets, Mercury,
Soapwort, each a handful; Lupines a dram, Niter half an ounce, boil them for a
Lotion. then use this ointment. Take powder of Staphisacre three drams, of
Lupins half an ounce, Agarick two drams, quick S^lphur a dram and half, Ox gall
half an ounce with ^yl of Wormwood: there are stronger, as white Hellebore and
Mecrury, which are not safe.

Chap. 6. Of Hydrocephalus or swelling of the Head.
WE spoke of this in the water without the Skull: but Hydrocephalus is from
wat^r gathered within the skull or in the ventricle^ of the brain, as when the
child's head in the womb hangs down, or when the brain is ver^ moist.

The Signs.
A tumor from water contained in the brain is less and harder then when it is
out of the skull.

The Prognostic.
It is harder to be cured then when it is gathered without the skull, and is
often deadly.

The Cure.
There are many medicines mentioned that are good here, to be used outwardly,
and to the nose and ears. As, Take Snails in their shells thirty, Marjoram,
Mugw^rt, each a handful; stamp, add Camphire a scruple, Saffron half a dram,
with Oil of Chamomil make a Pultis. Snuff this Water often. Take Nutmeg,
Cloves, C^bebs, each ^ s^ruple; Calamus, Frankincense bark, each half ^ dram;
Marjoram water three ounces, drop hot Oils into the ear^. If in twenty days
the water be not gone, open the skull, and let out the water by degrees, and
take heed of cold.

The tumor of wind in the skin of the head or membranes of the brain, is seldom
without water which breeds wind.

Use Discussers that make thin, as Chamomil, Rue, Organ, etc.

juice and water of Lettice, Gourds, Melons; or apply a Pumpion split in two.
But cool not the brain too much, anoint with Oil of Roses. Or, Take Oil of
Roses half an ounce, Populeon an ounce, the white of an Eg, and of the Emulsion
of cold Seeds drawn with Rose water two drams.

After the flux is stopped, and the inflammation abated, use Discussers. As, Take
Oil of Chamomil an ounce and half, of Dill half an ounce, with the yolk of an
Eg.

Let the Nurses diet be cooling, or the milk be changed: let it not be vexed.

Chap. 8. Of Frights in the Sleep.

HIppocrates says this is often; the cause is unclean vapors mixed with the

They arise from the depraved concoction of the stomach, in full feeding

the wea^and, but by the veins to the head. It comes often from wor^s also, or
corrupt humors that know the mouth o^ the stomach.

till it is in the bottom of the stomach. Use Oil of sweet Almonds or Honey of
Roses two spoonfuls to cleanse the stomach. Then strengthen it with Magistery of
Coral, or Con^ection of Hyacinths with Milk. Or, Take Magistery of Coral a
dram, Diapleres a scruple, with Sugar dissolved in Rose water an ounce m^ke
Rou^s.

Anoint the stomach with Oil of Nard, Wormwood, Mints, Mastich, N^tmegs. If it
be from a fever, look to that. If from wo^ms, I shall after speak of it. Some
hang Coral and Wolves teeth about the child's neck.

Chap. 9. Of great Wat^hing.
A Child new born sleeps more then he wakes, because his brain is very moist,

rather to be given the Nurse moderately, as sweet Almonds, Lettice, Poppy seeds.

Wash the feet with Decoction of Dill tops, Chamomil flowers, Sage, O^iers,
Vi^e leaves, Poppy heads. Cool not the head too much, nor use Narcoticks. These
are sa^e, Oil of Dill to the temples, Oil of Roses, with Oil of Nutmegs, with
Poppy seed, Breast-milk, Rose or Nightshade water with Saffron.

In great dryness of the brain, let the cove^ing of the cradeles head ^e wet.

Chap. 10. Of Epilepsie and Convulsion.
IT is either by consent from parts below, when the milk corrupts in the
stomach, or from an ill quality in it from the Nurses bad diet, or from worms
in the guts, or from vapors, from bad humors that twitch the membranes of the
brain, as in the Meazles and ^mall Pox.

It is sometimes from the brain first, as when the humors are bred in the brain
that cause it, either from the parents, or from distemper, or bad diet.

It may come from toothach also, when the brain consents, and from a sudden
fright.

The Signs.
It is manifest. You shall know by the signs of the diseases, whether it comes
from bad milk, worms or teeth. If from a fright, the people will tell you. If
these all are absent, it is certain that the brain is first affected.

The Prognostic.
It is a great disease, and kills for the most part young children. But when in
older, and it comes Hipp^. 58. apho. 7.
at a distance, it vanishes by age. If it come with Pox or Meazles, it cease
when they come forth if Nature be strong enough.

The best part of the cure is in the Nurses diet^ which must not be disordered.
If it be from co^rupt milk, provoke vomit, thus; hold down the tongue, and put
a quill dipped in sweet Almonds down the throat.

If it come from worms, give things that kill worms, with Piony roots, and the
like. If there be a fever, respect that also. Give Coral, Smaradgs, and Elkes
hoof.

In the ^it give Epileptick water, as Lavenderwater, and rub with the Oil of

Chap. 11. Of Strabismus, or Squint-eyes.
THis is when they lie in the cradle with their head from the light, or on one
side, and they still look toward the light, which causes distortion of the
eyes: or it may come from the Epilepsie, or by birth.

The Prognostic.
If by birth, it is not curable, nor if it come from an Epilepsie. If it come
from custom, and be new, it is curable.

The Cure. Lib. 1. par. 3. c. 43.
You must put a candle on the contrary side, or a picture, so long till the
eyes come to be right.

Chap. 12. Of pain in the Ears, Inflammation, Moisture, Ulcers, and Worms.
OF these in the first Book. But here we shall speak of in^ants^ the brain in
them is very moist, and has many excrements which Nature cannot send out at
its proper p^ssages; these get often to the ears, and cause pain, and flux of
blood, with inflammation and matter with ^ain.

The Signs.
In children pain and inflammation are hard to be k^own, they cannot relate it,
only it is k^own by constant crying, and feeling their ears, and will not let
others touch them; sometimes the parts about the ears are red.

have strong remedies. Only use warm milk about the ears, Oil of Violets, or
the Decoction of Poppy tops. To take away moisture, use Honey of Roses, and
Aqua Mellis, to be dropped into the ears. Or, Take Virgins Honey half an ounce,
red Wine two ounces, Alum, Saffron, Saltpeter, each a dram; mix them at the
fire. Or drop in Hemp seed Oil, with a little Wine.

Chap. 13. Of the Thrush, Bladders in the Gums, and Inflammation of the Tonsils.
THese are from bad milk, or from ^oul humors in the stomach, for the mouth is
tender, and connot endure the sharp milk, nor the vapors from the stomach,
because the coat is the same as in Lib. 2. Part. 1. Cap. 18.

The bladders in the gums are thus cured. Take Lentils busked, powder them, lay
it upon the gum^. Or, Take Milium in flour half an ounce with O^l of Ros^s make
a Linimem.

The inflammation of the Tonsils is more from eleven to thirteen, for then the

Chap. 14. Of Breeding of Teeth.
THis is a necessary evil in all children, and very great by reason of the
variety of symptoms joined with it. It is about the seventh month, first the
fore-teeth, then the eye-teeth, and last of all the grinders^ First they feel
an itching in their gums, then they are pierced as with a needle, and pricked
by the sharp bones, whence is great pain, watching and inflammation of gums,
fever, looseness and convulsions, especially when they breed their eye-teeth.

Foment the cheek with the Decoction of Althaea and Chamomil flowers, and Dill,
or with juice of Mallows, and f^esh Butter.

If the gu^s are inflamed, add juice of Nightshade and Lettice. Let the Nurse
keep a temperate diet inclining to cold, as Barley broaths, or Watergrewel,
rear Eggs, Prunes, Lettice, Endive. Avoid sal^, sharp, biting and peppered
meats, and Wine.

Chap. 15. Of Loosing of the Tongue, and of the Frog.
WHen the tongue is tied, they cannot freely suck. This must be done by skilful
Artists; or use this Liniment. Take clarified Honey, and boil it gently till it
may be poudered. Then Take yolks of hard Eggs dried in a glass in an Oven, till
they may be poudered, a dram, ^rankincense and Mastich, each a scruple; burnt
Alum six grains, with Honey of Roses make a Liniment.

The Frog is when the veins under the tongue, are filled with bad blood; and if
phlegm sweat out, and stick in the passages, there is a tumor like Mushrooms
which causes stamering. It is cured thus: Take Cuttlebone, Sal gem, Pepper,
each a dram; burnt Sponge three drams, make a Powder, or with Honey a Liniment:
rub under the tongue. Lay under the chin a Plaster of goose dung and Honey
boiled in Wine, till the Wine be consumed.

Chap. 16. Of Catarrh, Cough and difficult Breathing.
WE have spoken of these before, but Lib. 1. par. 2. c. 34.
because Hippocrates reckons them in Childrens diseases, I shall touch upon
them.

The general Cause of a Catarrh in a child, is The Causes
a moist brain, and much milk that burdens the stomach, from whence many vapors
fill the brain; and if the brain be full of excrements, it is easily dissolved
or melted, either by heat or cold, and goes to the nose, ^^ws or lungs, which
cause a cough or Asthma. Moreover much food makes crudities in the first
passages, and phlegmatic blood is bred of crudity and thick chyle in the liver.
This is sent by the ar^erial vein into the lungs, and pr^ssing the Bronchia or
pipes of the lungs, causes difficult breathing and Asthma.

It is known to be from a hot humor, if it be The Signs.

and the Nurse ^inds it in her nipples. If difficulty of breathing come from the
head, there will be a cough and snorting in breathing, and a noise in the
lungs, when the air passes not freely through them. If it come from the parts
below, there is neither C^tarrh nor cough, but hardness about the Liver, and a
tumor.

In children a great Catarrh with short breath The Prognostic.

First, let it and the Nurse keep a good diet, fill The Cure.
not the stomach with milk nor other diet; but let the Nurse forbear sharp,
salt, peppered, ^our things, and things that fill the head with vapors. And
give her a Pectoral Decoction: Take Figs, ^ujubes, each ten; Sebestens thirty,
Raisons stoned ^en drams, Liquorish two drams, Maidenhair, Hysop, Violets, each
half an ounce: boil them in three pints of Water, to the consumption of the
third part. Let her take six ounces every morning.

Keep the belly open with Syrup of Roses, or Cassia, or a Clyster; with oil of
sweet Almonds with Sugar candy, or juice of Fennel, with Milk, or hold down the
tongue, and provoke Vomiting.

Give Syrup of Jujubes, Maidenhair. If the matter be thick, give Syrup of
Hysop, or Horehound, or an Emulsion of oil of sweet Almonds, Pine-nuts,
Scabious water. Or give a Lohoch of Diaireos, Diatragacanth frigid, Pe^idies,
with Syrup of Jujubes.

If it be hot give Emulsions of the ^our great cold Seeds, with Mallows,
Pellitory, with Diatragacanth frigid.

To dry up the matter, lay outwardly a stuph of Hemp hot, and sprinkled with
powder of red Roses and Frankincense. Apply Basil and Marjoram to the nose, to
make it sneese.

Chap. 17. Of the Hickets.
IT comes from corruption of the food in the stomach, or from milk ^illing it,
or from cold (...) these hurt the expulsive faculty, and it is ^^^rred up to
expel what is hurtful.

Decoction of Mints, Organ, Wo^mwood; then anoint with Oil of Mints, Mastich,
Dill. Or, Take Mastich an ounce, Frankincense, Dill seed, each two drams;
Cummin seed a dram, with juice of Mints and Flax apply them to the stomach.

There is a disease like the Hi^kets in children from anger or grief, when the
Spirits are much sti^red, and run from the heart to the Diaphragma forceably,
and hinder or stop the breath Sometimes they have a shril voice, the Spirits
suddenly breaking forth, but when the passion cease, this Symptom cease.

Chap. 18. Of Vomiting.
IT is from too much milk or bad milk, or from fl^gm that falls from the head to
the stomach, but this is seldom in children. It is often from a moist loose
stomach, for as dryness retains, so looseness lets go.

green, or otherwise ill colored, and stinking: worms are known by their signs.

It is for the most part without danger in children, The Prognostic.
and they that vomit from their birth, are the lustiest, for the stomach being
not used to meat, and milk being taken too much, oftentimes crudities are
easily bred, or the milk is corrupted, and it is better to vomit these up, then
keep them in. If Vomiting last long, it causes A^rophy.

When it is from too much milk^ give it less: The Cure.
if it be from corrupt milk, amend it, as I showed. Cleanse the child with Honey
of Roses; and strengthen the stomach with Syrup of Mints, Quinces. Or, Take
Wood-aloes, Coral, Mastich, each half a dram; Galangal half a scruple, with
Syrup of Quinces make a Linc^us.

If the humor be sharp and hot, give Syrup of Pomegranates, Currants, Coral.

Apply to the belly the Plaster of Bread, the Stomach-cerot, or Bread dipped in
Wine hot. Or, Take Oil of Mastich, Quinces, Mints, Wormwood, each half an
ounce; of Nutmegs by expression half a dram, Chemical Oil of Mints three drops.
Coral has an occult propriety, therefore it is hung about their necks.

Chap. 19. Of the torments or pains of the Belly.
IT is often with the flux of the belly, and from milk alone that breeds wind
and sharp humors. When it is corrupted, it gets to the guts, and causes a
gnawing pain: worms staying in the guts, do the same.

they break wind. If it be from humors, it is constant: if it be tough phlegm,
the belly is bound, and the dung is slimy. If it be sharp, there is a flux
yellow and green. If from worms, there are signs of them, and of crudities and

Anoint the belly with Oil of Dill, or lay Pellitory stamped with O^l of
Chamomil to the belly. Or, Take Chamomil flowers, Dill tops, each a handful;
Faenugreek and Lineseed, each half an ounce; boil them in Wine, foment the
belly twice a day before meat.

If pain be from corrupt milk that is sharp, give Syrup of Roses, or Honey of
Roses, or Syrup of Succory, with Rhubarb, or a Clyster of the Decoction of
Bran, Pellitory, with S^rup of Roses. And use outwardly Oil of Roses, Dill and
Chamomil.

Chap. 20. Of puffing up of the Belly and Hypochondria.
WHen they suck too much, the belly is swelled under the ribs, for want of
concoction, and there are crudities in the stomach and wind, and also in the
parts adjacent.

breeding of teeth: if from external cold, there are signs of no other causes.
If from a humor flowing from the head, there are signs of a C^tarrh, and the
excrements are ^roathy. If crude humors are voided, there is wind, belching,
and phlegmatic excrements. If they be yellow, green and stink, the ^^ux is from
a hot and sharp humor.

It is best in breeding of teeth, when the belly The Prognostic. Hipp. lib. de

is loose; but if it be too great^ and you fear Atrophy, it must be stopped: if
black excrements are voided with a fever, it is bad.

A sucking child needs not cure so much as the The Cure.
Nurse, you must chiefly observe the condition of the milk and mend it, if not,
change the Nurse, and let her not eat green fruit, and things of hard
cocoction. If the child suck not, take away the causes of the flux, with purges
that bind after: as Syrup or Honey of Roses, or a Clyster. Take the decoction
of Milium, My robalans, each two or three ounces; with an ounce or two of Syrup
of Roses make a Clyster. After clensing, if the cause be hot, give Syrup of
dried Roses, Quinces, Mirtles, Coral, Curr^ns, or the powder of Diamar^ariton,
Coral, Mastich, Hartshorn, red Roses, or powder of Mi^tles, with a little
Sanguis Draconis.

Anoint with Oil of Roses, Mirtles, Mas^ich. Or, Take red Roses an ounce,
Mirtles, Mas^ich, each two drams; with Oil of Mirtles and Wax make an Ointment.
Or^ Take red Roses, Moulin, each a handful; Cypress roots two drams, make a
Bag, boil it in red Wine, apply it to the belly: or use the Plaster of Bread
or Stomach ointment.

If the cause be cold, and excrements white, give Syrup of Mastich and Quinces,
with Mintwater.

Use outwardly Mints, Mastich, Cummin. As, Take Rose seeds an ounce, Cummin^
Aniseeds, each Lib. 3. par. 2. cap. 5. and 6.

Chap. 22. Of binding of the Belly.
IT is from a cold and dry distemper of the guts, from birth in some. 2. From
slimy phlegm that wraps the dung, which sticks in the guts. This is from bad
milk, when the Nurse eats gross food, slimy and astringent, or drinks little.

excrements. 4. It is when choler does not stir up the guts to expel.

If it be from a dry distemper of the guts, it is The Signs.
hard to be cured: if it be from slimy phlegm, the dung is wrapped in it. If
choler comes not to the guts to provoke them to stool, the dung is white, and

headache.

First, take away the cause: if it be from a hot distemper of any bowel, or

often, to moisten and cool it in a Bath of Succory and Le^^ice boiled. In a
cold distemper use hot for the stomach, and in a dry use moist things, as Oil
of Lillies, Dialthaea, Hens grease, Butter. Let the Nurse avoid astringent
me^ts, as Q^in^es, Medlars, Beans, and use Emollients. If the chi^d be big,
give juice or Decoction of red Colwo^ts, worts, with a little Salt and Honey.
If it be from slimy phlegm, give Honey or Syrup of Roses. Correct the hot
distemper of the Liver and Reins, with Syrup of Violets, and Emulsions of the
four great cold Seeds. If choler come not from the Gall to the Guts, give the
Decoction of Grassroots, Fennel, Sparagus, Maidenhair.

Give Clysters to cut and cleanse tough phlegm. As, Take Al^haea roots, Mallows,
Pellitory, each half a handful; Faenugreek and Lineseed, each a dram; Chamomil
flowers a pugil: boil, and to three or six ounces, ad three drams of Cassia,
Oil an ounce, and the yolk of an Eg.

To the Navel, apply Hens grease, and Ox gal. Or, Take Aloes two drams, Ox gall
a dram, Scamony a scruple, with Butt^r make an Ointment. Fill a Walnut shell
with it, and apply it to the Navel. Anoint the belly with Emoillients. Take
fresh Butter, Goose and Hens grease, each half an ounce; Oil of sweet Almonds,
and Lineseed, each two drams; Veal marrow, Dialthaea, each two drams; with Wax
make an Ointment: Bran and juice of Danewort make a loosning Cataplasm for the
belly. Only keep it from the stomach, as you must do other Cataplasms.

Chap. 23. Of the Worms.
IT is observed that children have had worms in Ex authore lib. 4. de morb.
their mothers belly, and voided them after they were born. But they are
chiefly bred by mixing milk with other meats in a hot and moist constitution,
and from sweet meats which wo^ms love; and Summer-fruits: they are round and
long, or broad and little.

Besides what is said in Lib. 3. Part 2. Sect. 2. The Signs.
Cap. 5. Worms are known to be in a body, when there is much spittle, and a
stinking breath, troublesome sleep, gnashing of teeth, crying and bawling; a dry
cough, loathing, vomiting, hickets, want of appetite, or too much, thirst, a
belly swelled, or bound, or too loose, thick white urin with pain, when the
belly is empty, and the worms want food. There is a cold sweat over the face,
and a high color, with sudden paleness; sometimes a fever and convulsion
which cease presently. These are the signs of round worms rather then of the
flat.

Infants are often long troubled with worms The Prognostic.
without any great inconvenience, sometimes there are great Symptoms. The long
round worms are worst, and have eaten sometimes the guts and belly through,
with a fever they are more dangerous: few are better then many, and small then
great, white are better then those of other colors. The other Prognostics are
mentioned in other places.

Preservation.
It is better to prevent the breeding of worms then to expel them, by eating of
meats of good juice, with Oranges and Pomegranates, and avoiding sweet, fat and
slimy meats, fish, milk, and Summer-fruits, and figs. Drink thin Wine, and
Grass and Sorrel water with it, and with powder of Hearts horn.

Let the belly be kept loose, with Clysters for children: or give the Decoction
of Sebestens before meat, or of Wormwood and Scordium, but children will not
take bitter things; therefore give Grass water, and juice of Lemons or Cit^ons,
or a drop or two of Spirit of Vitriol.

When you know by the signs, that there are The Cur^.
worms, kill and expel them with powder of Coralline, Wormseed. Hearts horn, or
eight grains of Mercurius dulcis. Infuse them a night in g^ass water, and cast
away the substance o^ the Mercury, and give the Water. Or, Take Wo^mseed two
drams, Coralline, Hearts horn prepared, each a dram; roots of Piony, Dittany,
Magistery of Coral, each a scruple; make a Powder: or give the Essence of Peach
flowers, or the Decoction, of Fernwater half an ounce, or an ounce. If there be
a fever, use colder, as juice of Lemons, Pomegranates, Oranges, Vinegar, Hearts
horn, Bezoar, Confection of Hyacinth, or this Potion. Take Grass water four
ounces, Syrup of juice of Citrons an ounce, of Violets half an ounce, Spirit of
Vitriol two drops, give two spoonfuls.

Give bitter things at the mouth, and sweet at the fundament, as a Clyster of
Milk. Or, Take Raisons ten, Figs seven, boil them in water, take of it four
ounces, add Sugar an ounce and half, make a Clyster. Use varieties that the
worms may not be too familiar with one.

Apply Peach leaves to the Navel bruised, or a Cataplasm of Ox gall, Wormwood
and St. Johnswort. Or, Take powder of Wormwood, Gith, Centaury, Wormseed,
Lupines, each half an ounce; with Oil of Wormwood, and Wax half an ounce, make
an Ointment. Or, Take Treacle half an ounce, with juice of Wormwood apply it to
the navel: or make a Bath of Peach leaves and Wormwood, put the child into it
up to the navel. If there be a Fever, use colder things mentioned.

Chap. 24. Of the Rupture.
IT is from the Peritonaeum loose or broken, when the s^all guts fall into the
cods, from crying, cough, strainin^ at stool^ and from vehement motion, or a
fall. Sometimes the Peritonaeum is well, and a water falls from the belly into

for it is safer, but worse then that of water which goes away of it self when
the water is consumed.

Let the belly be kept open, let not the child The Cure.
cry. Avoid vehement motion, lay him upon his back, and thrust it up gently,
and apply this Plaster. Take Lambs tongue, Sanicle, each half an ounce;
Lentils, and Lupines, and red Roses in powder, each two drams; Frankincense a
dram, Alum half a dram, with the white of an Eg. Or, Take Frankincense,
Cypress nuts, Alo^s, Acacia, each two drams; Mirrh a dram, with Izinglass make
a Plaster. Or apply Gum Elemni steept in Vinegar, till there be a Cream at the
top, and with oil of Eggs make a Cerot.

Inwardly, Take Sanicle, Lambs tongue, each half a handful; Agrimony a handful,
Comfrey the greater half an ounce, boil them, to a pint strained, ad Sugar,
give it often. Or give powder of Mousear or Moonwort with Wine.

If it be from water, anoint with Oil of Elder, Bays, Rue; or apply a
Cataplasm of powder of Beans, ^oenugreek, Lineseed, Chan^^mil flowers, Cummin
seeds, with these Oils.

Chap. 25. Of sticking out of the Navel.
IT is without inflammation. 1. When it was not well tied, and too much left
that sticks out. 2. When the Peritonaeum is loose, and has water or wind in
it, from crying or coughing. 3. When the navel is ulcerated, and the guts fall
into it: this is called properly Exomphalon.

The navel yields to the touch, but in an inflammation, The Signs.
it is hard; there is neither heat nor redness^ and it lasts longer then an
inflammation.

If the navel was not well cu^, there will be too great a quantity, if the
Peritonaeum be not broken, but loose, the navel starts not much out, and is not
greater by crying; if it be broken, the tu^or scarce appears when he lies upon
his back, but it increases by crying or walking.

If the Peritonaeum be broken, first put in the gut, then bind it close, after
you have laid on astringent Pouders. Or, Take powder of ^ypressnuts,
Frankincens^, Mi^^l^, Mastich, Sarcocol, All^m, ^^inglass, each a dr^m; with

THere are many causes in ripe age that are mentioned, but in Infants they are
chiefly two causes: the thick humor that breeds the stone, that makes a

Chap. 32. Of Leanness and Fascination.
Sometimes children and men grow lean; the elder from Fevers, Consumptions, and
other diseases; but children pine away, and the cause is not known, and though
they eat and perform other actions, they are not nourished no^ grow.

The causes of Consumption in Infants are, The Causes
little or bad milk by which no blood is bred fit to nourish the body, so that
they thrive not till they change the Nurse.

The second is worms that suck away the nourishment.

The third is worms about the body without, ^s in the Back, Aims^ ^r Leg^ and
all parts, these are very small and br^ed in^ ^^ufculous parts, and stick in
the skin, and never come wholly out, but after rubbing in baths, they put forth
their heads like black hairs, and run in when they feel the cold air: they
breed of ^^imy matter shut up in the capillar veins, which turns to worms from
transpiration hindered.

The fourth cause in the opinion of people is fascination or witchcraft, either
from the eyes of Witches, or by vapors, or by touch, or by words from a Witch;
these are alleged by many Authors. I neither allow nor plainly deny all these
ways of fascination, though it is not credible that a child should suffer by
words or looks only. I deny not but diseases may be sent from sick bodies to
others, as the Leprosy, the French Pox, Consumption, and the like, and may
infect Infants. And I believe that they may be hurt by Witches and malicious
persons by the help of the Devil and Gods permissio^, as Basil the great
writes: for wicked people make B^sin ho^e invidia.
a league with the Devil that they may hurt such as they look enviously and
angerly upon. And I add one thing, a habit of body that is grown very excellent
is in most danger, as Hippocra^^s ^aith, when children come to be very
healthful and fair, they fall suddenly into a disease, and the vulgar not
knowing the cause of it, impu^e it to Witchcraft.

The signs of the causes, if they be lean from a The Sign^
fever or other disease, it is easily known. If these causes be not, view the
Nurses milk^ whether little, or her breasts ^lag without milk, and that is the
cause of leanness in the child; if she have milk, see if it be not hot and dry,
and choleric. And consider her constitution. If the milk be blameless, see if
it be not from worms either in the Guts or in the skin; the wo^ms in the skin
are known by putting the child into a bath and rubbing it, especially on the
back with the hands, and with Honey and Bread, and then you shall see little
ash colored or black hairs come out of the skin.

If there be no outward nor inward cause, you may mistrust a venomous vapor or
witchcraft.

If it be for want of milk, change the Nurse. The Pr^gnostic^^
If it be from worms in the skin, it is not hard to be cured; if it be from an
occult quality, or from Witchcraf^, it is hard to be cured, because we know not
the nature of the malignity.

If the Nurse have any Disease, or be contrary The Cure.
to the constitution of the child, change her, kill and cast out the worms. If
it be from worms in the back, rub it and anoint it with Honey and To Cure al
diseases Read my Sennertus, Platerus, Rive^^us, Bartholinus, and Ri^lanus, of
the last Edition.
Wheat bread, and when their heads come forth kill them with a Razor or crust of
bread^ do this often.

There are many superstitious things carried about against witchcraft, some
hang Amber and Coral about the child's neck, nor is it impossible that plants
and Gemms should have power against witchcraft, As, Briony root, and Elks hoof
are ^ood against the Epilepsie, also there are Amulets against other diseases^

^f leanness be from a dry dist^mper of the whole body there is no better
Remedy the^ often bathing in a decoction of Mallows. Althaea, Branckursine,

and anoint after with oil of Roses and Violets.
