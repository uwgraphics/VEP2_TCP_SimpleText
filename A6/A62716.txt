To the Constables and Overseers of(...)
BY virtue of a Warrant to me directed from the standing Committee at
Chelmsford, intimating that the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament
considering the oppressions and miseries that now do threaten the utter ruin
and desolation of this Kingdom in general, and of this, and the other
associated Counties in particular, and how necessary it is that all men well
affected that have any compassion toward their afflicted Country should now
put themselves into a present posture of defense, by raising forces of Horse
and Foot for the defense of the association from the invasion of Irish Rebels,
popish and other ill affected persons, have for these and many other weighty
reasons by an Ordinance bearing date the fifth of July last, Ordained and
Declared that this County among others shall be put forthwith into a posture of
defense. These are therefore to require you by the Authority aforesaid to
return the names, at the time and place hereafter appointed, of all persons
within your Precincts who are vvorth one hundred pounds or more in lands or
goods, or in lands and goods together; to the end they may be charged severally
with Horse and Arms, so as no person be charged with an Harquibushire or
light Horse unless he has an hundred pounds per annum in lands, or be vvorth
one thousand two hundred pounds in goods and lands; nor with a Dragoone
unless he be vvorth four hundred pounds in goods, or forty pounds per annum
in lands; nor with a Foot-Armes, unless he be vvorth an hundred pounds in
goods, or ten pounds per annum in lands. You are likewise required to publish
to all men, that this extraordinary charge and imposition of Arms, according
to the express words of the Ordinance it self, shall continue no longer then
during these times of imminent danger, and shall be no president for the
future. And you are to make return hereof unto the Deputy Lieutenants at the
sign of the (...) in (...) on (...) being the (...) day of next ensuing by
nine of the clock In the morning.
