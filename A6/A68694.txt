The Preface.
GRace mercy and peace from God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ by whose
means we are made of strangers free Citizins, and of the household of god and
appointed to dwell in his kingdom again, so that we be not disobedient unto his
calling by his holy spirit, which spirit, is a sure certain maker of our
spirit, that we be the true begotten sons of God. Deerly beloved when that
I did remember how willing* that the Israelites were at the making of the
Tabernacle, every man to give part of that which he had (toward the building
of the same) yea and such plenty came in daily to the woorkmen, that stay was
made for bringing in any more. And also how that in Salomons days, every man
gave to the building of the temple more or less, and now seeing it has
pleased our Iehoas to give commandment to the Preests to repair the Temple at
their charge. And our Darius to forbid any man to hinder the woork, but all me^
to further the same: I (as a cariar of rubbishe or fillinges) have thought my
self to negligent in looking (...) so long, and although that my labor be
small, and my cunning much less, yet let the free Masons (or master
woorkme^) bear with me, and accept my good will, be seeching them to build on as
they have begun, that I, and such prentises of theirs as I am: may daily learn
at their hands, at length to be journey men, the head master of all assisting
us. I have taken in hand to make in meeter, the cheef and principal matters in
the whole Bible, keeping the order of the chapters as they stand, and also
beginning the first* chapter of every book with A. the first letter of the
Crosserowe, and the second B. the third C. and so to the letter U. the Alphabet
to last, xx. letters, keeping on twenty Chapters. Now if the book or part of
the same be above twenty chapters: the^ begin I with A. again, as for example,
Genesis has fifty Chapiters, therefore because that it should not be to
tedious: it is divided into two parts, as the first part five and twenty
Chapters, and so the next, then when the twenty chapiters be done, A. and so
B. C. D. E. which are five letters, and there ends that part, then begins
the next part with A. again, and so to twenty, and then those five letters
again, and so ends that book and fifty chapters, but some book has not
twenty chapiters, as here in this setting out, the book of Ruthe, then goes
the letters no further then there be chapters, as D. is the fourth letter, so
has that story but four chapters. Know the letter and his number, and then
you have the Chapter, for the which I have here devised how that the simple
man or other shall tell the most of all the matters notable in the Bible, upon
his fingers, as here after is a hand held abroad upright, and another hand
closed in saving the fore finger, which points to the top of the thumb on
the left hand, where stands the letter A. and the number one, so hold thou
out thy left hand, and point with thy fore finger of thy right hand, to the top
of thy left hand thombe, and understand that there is the first letter, the
first in number, and the first chapter of each book (unless that it begin
again as I told thee of Genesis) then though it be the first letter, yet
stands it for one and twenty in number and chapters. So then to the next
joint of the thombe and that is B* the second letter, the second number and
chapter, then the third joint, is third in number and Chapter also, then to the
top of the fore fiinger, and there is D. the fourth letter, the fourth in
number, and the fourth chapter, and so as before, until that you come to the
last joint of the little finger, and that is the letter T. and the number
nineteen, and in the palm of the hand stands the letter U. and that is the
number twenty and chapter likewise, now then there is no more, but be sure to
learn what number every joint is, and what letter, and then having the letter
and the number, the chapter is so in number, as the staff does begin with
all in letter, but be sure of the book in which the story is, that you would
know, as to make you parfit, here is examples by order of questions, thou must
have ye book parfet by rote, then one asks thee, where is it in the book of
Genesis that the Angels came and lodged with Lot the night before that Sodom
and Gomorra were destroyed, if thou be not altogether parfet, ask him whether
he can say the staff, if he cannot, if he have the book bid him tell thee the
letter, if he cannot neither, then thy cunning shall be the more tried, well this
it is.

The staff begins with T. what number is T. that is nineteen, say then.

Two Angels lodgd, and Sodom men,
would then have them defilde:
Blind^d they were and after stroyd,
save Lot and his vnfilde.
THe hardest example is this, where is it that Abraham charged his man to go
and fetch a wife for Isaac of his own kindred, and how he brought Rebecca,
the chapter is the four and twenty of Genesis, and the staff begins with D.
as. Decree did Abram to his man. etc. Now D. in the number of letters is the
fourth, but then twenty Chapiters be before, and therefore D. in that place is
four and twenty, so that A.B.C.D.E. are some times one and twenty, two and
twenty three and twenty, four and twenty, and five and twenty Chapiters.
But to conclude, this I do exhort, that ye learn to say this book without
the book, so shall you soon understand all that I have said, the study is good
and profitable, and it once obtained, great commodity shall you find: as
hearing a Preacher preach, if he say this text, this place, this story, this
parable and this sentence is in the scripture, if no: thou shall know for the
most places, if yea: thy conscience shall be joined to his, his saying to be
true, and also it shall be joyful unto thee, to hear that place brought into thy
remembrance, yea and sometime (as now, blessed be God is often heard) a hard
place or dark speaking, or a story applied and expounded to thy great comfort
and edifiyng. And in continuance thou shall be able to say much in holy
writings, and to understand many things necessary to be known for every
christian, which is my only desire, knowing that exercise in godlynes is much
worth, and all scriptures of God are good for the man of God, both to be
improued and also instructed, that he may be parfet (which God send my cuntrie
poeple once to be) that Gods merciful hand may be always over us, who ever be
praised.

Note that if the book be divided in two parts: then be sure of the number of
chapters in the first part, and then set them to those following, as is showed
thee before, as the first part of Genesis is five and twenty chapters, then A.
in the beginning of the second part is six and twenty, and B. seven and
twenty, and forth to five and forty, and then A. is six and forty, and so
to fifty.

depiction of two hands showing counting using fingers, forming a key to
chapter numbers.

TO every joint,
The finger point,
In order as they stand:
The letter then,
To all those men,
That take this book in hand.
Then shall they know,
And plainly show,
The Chapter out of d^^t:
Of any thing,
In this writing,
The letter once found out.
From A. to V.
The thing is true,
The Alphabet does last:
Even twenty just,
From last to first,
So count you must to cast.
If you once find,
The letter in mind,
And know what number it is:
You may be sure,
Of that Scripture
To hit and not to miss.
But perfet must,
You be to trust,
The letter and his sum:
And then you may,
Withouten nay,
The story tell to come.
Also the book,
See that you look,
How it is called by name:
And then the text,
And number next,
Be sure it is the same.

In. G. Ex. L.N. and D,
The five books of Moses contained be.

The i. Chapter.
ALmighty God did make the heavens
and set therein these lights
The Sun, the Moon, and all the stars
appeering in our sightes.
The earth, the Sea, and all therein,
all these his word did make:
With man made last and yet set first,
his will on them to take.
The ij. Chapter.
BEgin did then the Lord to rest,
From making of such things
And pointed Adam to a place.
a garden full of springs.
One tree denied, and man does name
the beasts after his will:
In sleep to him his make was made,
which did his mind fulfill.
The iij. Chapter.
CAused was man by Satan's slight
Gods will to break outright:
The he, the she, and the Serpent
are cursed and driven out quite.
For fear lest man should then despair,
with his wife and to hell:
The woman's seed yt which was Christ
shall come and make all well.
The iiii. chapter.
DOwn fell Abel, Cain him slew,
in offering to the Lord:
The just was slain of the unjust,
as scripture does record.
Then is he cursed and does despair,
after his wicked deed:
The genealogy of Adams sons,
and their sons does proceed.
The v. chapter.
Every year that Adam lived,
is there most plainly told:
Whose age was then even nine hundred
and full thirty year old.
And so from him unto just Noe,
the chapter does express:
The names and years how long they lived
with much of their success.
The vi. chapter.
Full wicked were the people tho,
a flud was threat of God:
With a precept to make an ark,
even as the Lord had bod.
And then did Noe prepare the ship,
after the Lords devise:
And ready pressed as he was wild
against the flud should rise.
The vii. chapter.
GOd spoke these words to Noe his man
and we thereto must hark:
Go thou and all thy family,
with speed into the ark.
Even so did Noe as God him bad,
and took of each kind twain:
His wife, his sons, and all their wives,
and then began the rain.
The viii. chapter.
Hundredth days and od fifty,
the flud began to end:
A Raven and eke a Dooue also,
Noe, forth for news did send.
Then went Noe forth and did offer,
to God burnt sacrifice:
Which liked well the God on hie,
when the smell did arise.
The ix. chapter.
IN favor then was Noe and blessed,
and murder is denide:
A rainbowe sent, and promise made
with water not destroyed.
Then Noe fell drunk and lay vnhilde,
and Ham his son was glad:
The other hilde him and were blessed,
But Ham his cursing had.
The x. chapter.
Know ye may of Noe his sons,
As Sem, Ham and Iapheth:
Chus, Hams son begot Nemrod,
a hunter on the heath.
Of these three sons and their sons sons
the earth was storde again:
In tungs and kinds with realms and lands,
But most of them were vain.
The xi. chapter.
LEwdly forth went this rout to build,
Babel that great hie toure
The Lord came down and chau^gd their tungs
in less space then an hour.
The kind of Sem again is told,
unto just Abraham:
Which went with Lot his fathers son
and dwelled at Haran.
The xij. chapter.
Much favor God showed to Abram,
dwelling in Canaan:
Which God him plight, then came a dearth,
to Egypt went he than.
Then willed he Sarai his wife,
to call him brother tho:
The king her took and was plaged,
whose name hight Pharao.
The xiii. chapter.
Neighborlike yode Lot and he,
And toward the south they went*
Then parted they their land and good
that God had to them lent.
The promise then to Abram is,
repeated once again:
That he and his seed after him,
the blessed land should obtain.
The xiiij. chapter.
OF foren kings Lot taken was,
which ward and wan that land:
But then Abram did them destroy,
and took him from their hand.
Melchisedech with bread and wine,
him met with mickle boste:
He gave him tenth and paid the king,
of Sodom all he lost.
The xv. chapter.
Perform would God the land he had,
to Abram promised:
A son to have he does believe,
and so is justified.
How that his feed in bondage should,
in Egypt there remain:
And be restorde unto their land,
and so sent home again.
The xvi. chapter.
QUite barren Sara thought she was
and gave Abram her maid:
Which did conceive and being proud
her mistres did vpbraid.
Her mistres chod, and she to go,
for faring with her fell:
An Angel her returned again,
and plight her Ismael.
The xvii. chapter.
Remove did God then Abrams name,
and called him Abraham:
And Sarai is named Sara,
of whom tho Isaac came.
The sacrament is here begun
of Circumcision:
Isaac is plight, and Abraham
for Ismael does moan.
The xviii. chapter.
SO unto him three men apeerd,
like trauaylers of miles:
Sara did hear that she should bear,
and womanlike she smiles.
The overthrow of Sodom then,
to Abraham they told:
He prays to them being one God,
his vengeance to with hold.
The xix. chapter.
TWo Angels lodged, and Sodom men
would then have them defilde:
Blinded they were and after stroyd,
save Lot and his vnfilde.
His wife to salt was turned tho,
for breaking Gods precept:
His daughters he begat with child
when drunklike he had slept.
The xx. chapter.
WHen Abraham did flit he dwelt,
In the land of Gerar:
His wife was fair, he feared his life
and called her sister.
Abimeleck sent for her then,
his pleasure for to have:
God him denide and then the king,
Much riches to her gave.
The xxi. chapter.
Almighty God to Sara sent,
Isaac her only son:
And Agar with her child put out,
no longer there to won.
An Angel did her comfort tho,
being in wilderness
About a well, Abimeleck
and Abraham made peace.
The xxij. chapter.
BEing then wild, to kill his son,
and he thereto was pressed:
God told him that for his great faith
in him all should be blessed.
Nachor brother to Abraham,
had eight sons by Milcha:
One of her sons was Bethuel*
Father to Rebecca.
The xxiij. chapter.
COmmend to God, did Sara then
her soul that was so mild:
At her full years she fell on sleep.
and died vndefilde.
Then Abram bought a plat of ground,
of Ephron the Hethite:
He laid his wife into the cave,
when it was his by right.
The xxiiij. chapter.
DEcree did Abram to his man,
and swear him by an oath:
To seek a wife for Isaac meet
and so he did for trothe.
He went and came with Rebecca,
which Isaac took to wife:
So lived they together both,
and led an honest life.
The xxv. chapter.
Eftsoons did Abram take a wife,
which bare him children more:
He died and gave Isaac his son
his good and all his store.
Then Isaacs wife even at one birthe,
Jacob and Esau bare:
And Esau sold him land and right,
And yet small was his fare.
Thus have you heard of Genesis,
The pith and half the some:
Twenty and five in chapters past,
Since that the first begun.

The xxvi. chapter.
A Death then came in Isaacks time,
and so he did remove:
That land was plight to him and his
of God that did him love.
The king chod Isaac for his wife,
because he did but fain:
And shepherds strove about the wells,
but all was well again.
The xxvii. chapter.
BEgilde did Jacob Esau then,
Rebecca wrought the feat:
While Esau hunted in the feeld,
his brother got the cheat.
When Esau came from hunting home,
it vexed him right sore:
His father cheerd him, yet did he
his brother hate therefore.
The xxviii. chapter.
Commanded Jacob sought a wife
and so to Laban went:
Esau did wed an Ismaelite,
which unto evil was bent:
As he in sleep a Ladder saw,
with Angels goodly dight:
Of Christ is told a vow he made,
unto the God of might.
The xxix. chapter.
DEcree with Laban, Jacob did,
and served him seven year:
Rahel to have it was his fee,
but Lea did appeer.
And so begil'd, yet did he serve
as much for Rachel more:
He having both four babes he had,
which Lea to him bore.
The xx. chapter.
Each of them both they gave their maid
to their husband to wiue:
So had he children that they bare,
they being still alive.
And Jacob asked what his reward,
should be at Labans hand:
The spotted lambs and kids of goats,
that fell in Labans land.
The xxxi. chapter.
FLit then from Laban God him ba^,
and so he did obey:
He took his wives and all his good,
and stily slipped away.
Then Rachel stale the Images,
against her fathers will:
And Laban chod, but peace was made,
with Jacob on an hill.
The xxxij. chapter.
GOds host he saw as he forth went,
his brothers wrath he feared:
And therefore sent him gifts before,
even hundreds on an heard.
He with an Angel strove so long,
til day did end the night:
The Angel changed Jacobs name,
and Israel him hight.
The xxxiij. chapter.
Hastily Esau set him out,
his brother for to meet:
And Jacob sent his herds before,
and came after on feet.
But when they met they greed well,
God so did woork with them:
In parting plotes they dwelt in two,
as Jacob in Sichem.
The xxxiiii. chapter.
Jacob no daughter had but one
that Dina hight by name:
She went to see and to be seen,
and so she came to shame.
For Sichem did the damsel see,
and forced her by might:
He was destroyed by Jacobs sons,
and all the city quite.
The xxxv. chapter.
Know well did Jacob all their spite,
to Bethel then he yed:
His name is told, and Canaan
is to him promised.
In child bed Rachel did depart,
and Benjamin she bore:
Ruben vnhilde his fathers wife,
and lost a fleese therefore.
The xxxvi. chapter.
LIkewise is told of Esaus wives,
and gentles daughters all:
He and Jacob were very rich,
in goods terrestrial.
Esau had Dukes that were his sons,
Even twelve in number just:
He was father to Edomits,
in whom God had no lust.
The xxxvii. chapter.
MOre for to hear of Jacobs life,
in Canaan he dwelt:
Joseph's breethern liked him not,
and cruelly they dealt.
Into Egypt then was he sold,
his brethern wrought the deed:
They told his sire his son was slain,
which made his heart to bleed.
The xxxviii. chapter.
NOw then is shown how Judah took
a wife of Canaan:
He had three sons two were destroyed,
the third was named Onan.
And Thamar was the woman's name,
which both of them did wed:
And Judah by her had two twins,
when she was brought a bed.
The xxxix. chapter.
O What an hap then Joseph had,
the Lord did so provide:
His masters wife did him provoke,
but he her suit denide.
She him accus'de but not deseru'de
her tale as then took place:
Whereby Joseph to prison went,
but giltles in that case.
The xl. chapter.
PUt in prison were Pharoes men,
and both of them laid fast:
His baker cheef, and butler both,
whiles his anger did last.
Joseph with them in prison was,
and as they slept full sound:
They dreamed dreams which unto the^
this Joseph did expound.
The xli. chapter.
QUestion asked of Pharoes dream,
of Oxen fat and lean:
Which Joseph did expound full plain
and told what they did mean.
He was set up, and ruler made
in Egypt over all:
Two sons he had and so the dearth,
on Egypt then did fall.
The xlii. chapter.
RIde out for corn did Joseph's kin,
and came to him unknown:
He threat them hard that they were spies
into that cuntrie blown.
Simion laid in prison is
whiles they did home return:
And Benjamin they took with them,
which made their father mourn.
The xliii. chapter.
SO back they went to Egypt tho,
with gifts and presents great:
And Simeon is delivered out,
and Joseph's cheeks are wet.
And Joseph could not then but weep,
when Benjamin he saw:
They sat and feasted in two parts
according to their law.
The xliiii. chapter.
THen Joseph wrought a pretty cast,
Benjamin for to have:
And theft he laid unto his charge,
such words to them he gave.
But Judah surety he became
for Benjamin his sake:
His father Jacob he did know,
it heuely to take.
The xlv. chapter.
Unknown was Joseph all this while,
at last he told them all:
That he their brother Joseph was,
That ruled great and small.
The xlvi. chapter.
APpointed forth then Israel went,
in Egypt for to bide:
And God him bad nothing to fear,
for all should well betide.
Jacob his sons and all their sons,
is then in order told:
And Joseph went them all to meet,
full joyful to behold.
The xlvij. chapter.
BRought was Israel before the king,
in his presence to stand:
And Pharao wild that he should dwell,
where fattest was the land.
Then Jacob swear Joseph his son,
even underneath his thie:
^is bones to lay in Canaan,
at time when he should die.
The xlviij. chapter.
CAusd was Israel sick to be,
by course of natures kind:
And Joseph went with his two sons,
to know his fathers mind.
Jacob did will that Joseph's sons,
Ephraim and Manasses:
Should be as children to him born,
which Joseph well did please.
The xlix. chapter.
DOwn fell his sons upon their knees
even twelve of them there was:
He blessed them all and told of things
that after came to pass.
Then chargd he them that they should lay
his bones in Manebrey feeld:
Then plucked he up his legs to him,
and up the ghost did yield.
The l. chapter.
Each thing was done, his corpse they took
as he on live did minge:
And laid it down by Abraham's side,
fulfilling so each thing.
Forgive did Joseph all the fault,
that his brethern had wrought:
And so he did and wild his bones,
to his fathers to be brought.
Here have ye now the end and some,
of Moses his first book:
The second shall in order come,
Such pain the writer took.

The first Chapter.
ANd then the first of Exodus,
the twelve tribes it does name:
Which being dead and laid in earth
their children came to fame.
A new king then to Egypt came,
that gave the midwiues charge:
To kill the males when they were borne
but they set them at large.
The ii. chapter.
BOrn Moses was and after cast,
even down the river in reeds:
And Pharoes daughter took him up
and showed him motherly deeds.
Then Moses slew an Egiptian,
and fled and took a wife:
The people cride unto the Lord,
which saw their woeful life.
The iii. chapter.
CAused was Moses sheep to keep,
not far from Oreb hill:
Wherein a bushe the Lord appeerd,
and told him all his will.
And bad him go to Egypt back,
the Israelites to tell:
That out of bondage they should come
and live and do full well.
The iiij. Chapter.
DEclaerd by double signs it is,
that called he was by God:
His reasons all they are assoild,
and forth the Lord him bad.
As Aaron met with him in feeld,
together then they went:
Of Iethro, Moses took his leave,
and yod where he was sent.
The v. Chapter.
Each both of them withouten fear,
told Pharao God his mind:
The more the people were oppressed*
the king was so unkind.
Then cride they out and began to chide,
with Moses and Aaron:
And Moses axed God the cause,
which looked them upon.
The vj. chapter.
FEft fully was deliverance,
unto the Israelites:
Also the land of Canaan,
which made them cheerful wightes
Then Rubens spring with Simeon,
is told and Leuy too:
Of whom came Moses and Aaron,
that had Gods hestes to do.
The vii. chapter.
GOd made Moses Pharoes God,
and Aaron his Prophet:
And then God turned Moses rod,
into a Serpent great*
The sorcerers did even the same,
to harden Pharoes heart:
Then were their waters turned to blood
yet did he not conuart.
The viij. chapter.
HIt was Pharao, then and plagued,
with Frogs over the land:
He sent for Moses and Aaron,
to take the thing in hand.
He mocked them, therefore the Lord
turned their dust to lice:
And they put by, then came there ^^ies,
after the Lords device.
The ix. chapter.
IN steed thereof came moren of beasts
that died in Pharoes land:
And sixthly sores with botches great,
yet did he God withstand.
The seventh was hail and thunder much
that made the land to shake:
And lightning great from heaven on hie,
which causd them all to quake.
The x. Chapter.
KNowledge he yet would not his faul^
but God he did resist:
He did it not in ignorance,
but well he knew and wist.
The eight plage next was grash^pper
that God almighty sent:
The ninthe was darkness in the day,
they knew not where they went.
The xi. chapter.
Leave then was given the Israelites,
the Egiptians to spoil:
Against they should depart and go,
and give them all a foil.
At midnight then the Lord did vow,
to make so great a slaughter:
The first born of Egypt to kill,
as it is told here after.
The xii. chapter.
MAde here is next the passover,
and sweet bread for to eat:
And if their children axt the cause,
the meaning they must treat.
The first born then destroyed are,
and robbed were the rest:
And so the Hebrews took their way,
toward the land behest.
The xiij. chapter.
NOw all the first in Isreal's birth,
the Lord did take and choose:
Commanding them a^ yearly feast,
among them for to use.
Then passed they the wilderness,
with Joseph's bones also:
Two pillars for the day and night,
they had thereby to go.
The xiiii. chapter.
OUt Pharo went hard in his heart
against the Israelites:
So folowde he with all his train,
and came within their sightes
But God his people did defend,
by night and day from harm:
They past the sea but Egypt men,
lay drowned in a swarm.
The xv. chapter.
PAst when they were this danger great
they sang a goodly song:
A woman came with diverse mo,
and daunced all along.
The bitter water was made sweet,
and pleasant for to drink:
God must be heard in his covenant
and on him must we think.
The xvj. chapter.
QUainted when that they were two months
within the wilderness:
They wished them selves again to be,
in Egypt at their flesh.
It rayned Quails from heaven on hie,
and Manna for their bread:
And forty years in wilderness,
with that they were all fed.
The xvij. chapter.
REmoouing on they lacked drink,
and grudge then did the flock:
At Moses suit then had they some
which came out of a rock.
Forth came a king hight Ameleck,
against them for to fight:
When Moses hands were holden up,
then were they put to flight.
The xviii. chapter.
SO Iethro Moses father in law,
came Moses for to see:
Who welcomde him, his wife and sons
after the best degree.
When Iethro saw what pains he took,
when judgment he did use:
Such active men as loved not coin
to help, he wild him choose.
The xix. chapter.
THen as they went they came unto,
the mount of Sinai:
A royal people they are called
if Gods will they apply.
The Lord did say, he that does touch
the hill, shall die outright:
But Moses wild, went up to him
in thunder and great light.
The xx. chapter.
WHen he was come he gave to him,
ten just commandments:
Precepts to keep and guide us by
with all their whole contents.
An altar of earth then God did bid,
his man Moses to make:
And if of stone he did it build,
no tool thereto to take.
Twenty chapters before are told,
in order as they stand:
The rest here after ye may read,
if ye will take in hand.

The xxi. chapter.
ANd then this book, as it is called,
even Exodus by name:
Does tell good laws for magistrates,
to execute the same.
That masters be not over sore,
their servants for to main:
And he that kills a man is iudgd,
for it he must be s^ain.
The xxij. chapter.
Behold you then these godly laws
of theft the fourth ^olde paid:
He that defiles an vnplight less,
he marry must the maid.
A witch and he that knows a beast
both die they must of right:
All usury it is forbod,
and ha^ed in Gods sight.
The xxiii. chapter.
COupeling wise these chapters three,
run all of civil laws:
Judges are wild to take no gifts,
but here the poor man's cause.
Thou may not follow a multitude,
wickedness to commit:
Nor have to do with foreign Gods,
though thou shoulds die for it.
The xxiiij. chapter.
DEcree to Moses God did then,
and to the head rulers:
To worship him the which does dwell,
on hie above the stars.
The law was told and all the rout,
with voice thereto obayes:
So Moses went up to the mount,
and bode there forty days.
The xxv. chapter.
Even then to him did God describe
the fashion of his place:
His tabernacle how to build,
in every point and case.
He promised that in that house,
with Moses he would treat:
Between the Cherubs in their place
which was his mercy seat.
The xxvi. and xxvii. chapter.
Forth on is told in these two next,
chapters of Exodus:
Which was declarde to Moses there
as God did it discus.
How that his holy place and house,
which was his temple tho:
Should be as he had it deuisde,
whereby he might it know.
The xxviii. chapter.
GOd did also to him describe,
how Aaron should be clad:
Such garments might the people tell
what office Aaron had.
A breast lap and a tunicle,
a strait cote under that:
With other things that he must were,
whether he stood or sat.
The xxix. chapter.
HOw Aaron should a Priest be made,
to him was reuelated:
With all his sons after what sort
they should be consecrated.
And God to him did promise then,
that he would be their God:
and they should know he had the^ saved,
from Pharao and his rod.
The xxx. chapter.
INioynd an altar he must make,
thereon to burn incence:
^lso on it to reconcile,
yearly for their offense.
^ brazen lauer he must make,
to wash and make all clean:
The anointing oil, with all the rest,
more holy things did mean.
The xxxi. chapter.
KNowledge two men the^ had of God
to woork the holy things:
The Saboth eke and day of rest,
God unto Moses minges.
and Tables twain the Lord did give,
to Moses on the hill:
^herin were writ the ten precepts,
which was the almighty's will.
The xxxii. chapter.
LIke fools a calfe was made there while
the people were so vain:
And Moses praid to God for them,
and burst the tables twain.
When he came down he chod the priest,
and burnt the calfe in fire:
Moses earnestly praid for them,
yet some were paid their hire.
The xxxiii. chapter.
March on forward God to them bad,
that they should thense depart:
But God denide to go with them,
they were of froward heart.
And when the people hard thereof,
they did lament in mind:
Moses willed to see Gods face,
and saw him but behind.
The xxxiiii. chapter.
NOw were the tables made again,
and God his mercy plight:
To cope with gentles or their Gods
it is forbidden quite.
The sweet bread feast is first begone,
and Saboth day is told:
The first fruits Moses heard expressed,
whose face did shine like gold.
The xxxv. chapter.
OF diverse things to them is told
that is before expressed:
To offer tithes and pay their fruits,
each one of them was pressed.
Bezaleel, Ahaliab,
which wrought in silk and says:
The tabernacle they must make,
and Moses does them praise.
The xxxvi. chapter.
Plenty of things did these two make
as God gave them in gift:
Kings of gold and curtens eke,
to run all in a drift.
The people brought such store of stuff,
that there was over much:
Willing they were to build Gods house
and for to make it rich.
The xxxvii. chapter.
QUite all of wood the Ark was made,
the mercy seat of gold:
The tables and the candlesticks,
were made of the same molde.
Lamps like cups that stood on them,
to burn and to give light:
The incence altar it was made,
according unto right.
The xxxviii. chapter.
REard up for offerings was the next,
which should there on be burnt:
A brazen lauer for to wash,
much like unto a funt.
Of Sicles thousands was the some,
that of good will they gave:
They sparde no cost to please the Lord,
so he their souls might have.
The xxxix. chapter.
SO Aarons garmenes they did make
Appointed for the nones:
Of costly gold and goodly silk,
all set with precious stones.
So finishe then they did the woork,
as God to Moses wild:
And he it blessed and praisd it much,
when he the woork beheld.
The xl. chapter.
THen last of all, almighty God,
to Moses told his mind:
How he should set the holy things,
in their order and kind.
The Lord did compass with a cloud,
the tabernacle quite:
The presence of the Lord of hosts,
was with it day and night.
Thus Exodus is finished,
just forty chapters all:
Leuiticus comes next to it,
which have likewise ye shall.

Leuiticus.
The first Chapter*
Almighty God then Moses told,
within Leuiticus:
How he should offer sacrifice,
the Lord did it discus.
Whether it were of beasts great,
or else of cattle small:
Of turtle dooues the manner how,
they should be offered all.
The ii. chapter.
BAked in cakes and offering
The manner them to trim:
If leaven were put in thereto,
then should it not like him.
Fine wheat flower and frankincense,
must go unto this feast:
Salt must season each sacrifice,
where it be foul or beast.
The iii. chapter.
COmely how that the offering,
for peace it should be v^de:
To make accord where strife was had
that hate might be refusde.
Of Oxen, sheep, with lambs and gotes*
atonement should be made:
Leuiticus the third Chapter,
does show the form and trade.
The iiij. Chapter.
DEfault if that the priest had made,
and done by ignorance:
Should reconcile with sacrifice,
confessing his mischaunce.
And if a Lord did likewise so,
offer he must likewise:
The subject for the same offense,
must offer sacrifice.
The v. chapter.
Each one that swear and not perfourmd
they must confess the deed:
And offer a Got or else a Lamb,
unless he be in need.
The order how he should be clensd,
that touched an unclean thing:
The ignorant that sinned then,
an offering must bring.
The vj. chapter.
FOr him that stale or did deceive,
his neighbor willingly:
Or found a thing and it denied,
five fold restore should he,
The dooers evil then offer should,
for their offense and sin:
An offering eke is told full right,
for Aaron and his kin.
The vii. chapter.
Give for their trespass the^ they must,
likewise for sin and peace:
The bakte and broilde, with fried flesh
is theirs that it does dress.
The fat or blood may no man eat,
it is denied plain:
Of beast or foul where so it die,
by chance or else be slain.
The viii. chapter.
HOw Aaron should, lo here is told,
anointed priest, then be:
And all his garments fit for him,
then meet for his degree.
And likewise for his sons thereto,
to minister also:
With all their Albes and Tunicles,
wherein that they should go.
The ix. chapter.
IN office Aaron offering made,
for him and all the rest:
And then the people out of hand,
by Aaron were all blessed.
This likte so well the God above,
his glory did appeer:
Consume he did the sacrifice,
before them all with fire.
The x. chapter.
Know well ye may that fire strange
was offered up a new:
And they were slain for their offense
Nadab and Abihu:
The priests were then forbidden wine,
to drink they were denide*
But they might eat the sacrifice,
if ought were left beside.
The xi. chapter.
Leave beasts must they that chue not cud
nor wear their hoofes in twain:
For man to eat for sustenance,
they might not then be slain:
Fish lacking scale, or fin to swim,
might not be eaten tho:
Nor diverse fowls, nor creeping beasts
which on the earth does go.
The xii. chapter.
Moses received a law him given,
for women that bare child:
Such pain to them and to the like
might teach them to be mild.
Eight days in house remain they should
and then be purified:
And offer gifts for sacrifice,
such as she might abide.
The xiii. chapter.
NOtes for the Lepers had the priests,
to judge them by their skin
A white spot that is waxed black,
a Lepre does begin:
All other notes if ye will know
a Leper how to deem
Let him then read the chapter all,
which is of L. thirteen.
The xiiii. chapter.
OF them when he must be receud,
among the folk again:
He must be clensd then of the priests,
by order written plain.
And all the house that he was in,
it must be clensd also:
With searching had when it begins
^re further that it go.
The xv. chapter.
POinted out is how men should be,
cleansed and purged clean:
If they were staind by course unkind
vnpurenes it does mean.
For women also it does show,
that have their birthright kind:
A sacrifice to purge them with,
for them then was assignd.
The xvj. chapter.
QUuickly is told then Aarons woork
within the holy place:
And how to cleanse the sanctuary,
the matter and the case.
The feast of clensing then is told,
how that it should be used:
And all was done as God them bad,
and naught at all refusde.
The xvii. chapter.
REquirde they were without the doors,
their offerings to be slain:
So was the Lord without the gates,
which died for our pain.
And God did them command they should
not offer unto devils:
Nor eat the blood nor carren meat,
but keep them from such evils.
The xviii. chapter.
SO then the ten and eight does tell,
what kinreds are forbod:
To mary spouse in wedlock rate,
which are denide of God.
But chargd they are to keep and save,
the Lord his hestes and will:
And quite to flee from gentiles trade
which all together are il.
The xix. chapter.
Told then is eke the ten precepts,
in ten and nine of L:
Let every man that looues the word,
give ear what they do tell.
To steal or lie, or false to deal,
or judge in matters wrong:
Nor man to wear a woman's coat,
where it be short or long.
The xx. chapter.
UNto the Gods ye which were strange
their seed they might not give:
Who that did so should feel this woe,
among them not to live.
And those that woork by sorcery,
thou may not to them trust:
And certain kinreds are forbod,
in which not cope thou must.
The xxi. chapter.
ANd if that one did hence depart,
the priest might not be by:
Nor yet be shaven on head nor chin,
for God did it deny.
Also their wives they must be maids,
their daughters living chaste:
Misshapen men may be no priests
of holy things to taste.
The xxii. chapter.
BEar in mind those that might not,
eat of the sacrifice:
Almighty God tho in his law,
shows then who he denies.
The manner how, that they should do,
when they to offer went:
All this was done to keep them back,
from doing their intent.
The xxiii. chapter.
Command did God the Saboth day,
and Easter to be used:
The first fruits feast, and Whitsontide,
it might not be refusde*
The feast of clensing also must,
be kept in order right:
With other feasts that there are ming^,
as Moses them did write.
The xxiiii. chapter.
DEcreed was then that lamps should b^
and oil in them light:
With show bread set upon a boorde,
each saboth in their sight.
The child that cursed and did blaspheme
was stoned unto death:
And he that kills a man must die,
as God almighty says.
The xxv. chapter.
Each seven year tho the saboth year
must solemnly be kept
No vine was cut, for that whole year
nor corn yet sown or rept.
The first year were the bondmen free,
and lands restorde again:
All usury it is forbod,
by words that are full plain.
The xxvi. chapter.
FOrbid did God all Images,
by words most plainly told:
To them to kneel he does deny,
a man to be so bold.
God will defend his people all,
that will his word obey:
But they which not regard his will
their councels shall decay.
The xxvii. chapter.
GOd told how vows should prised be
woman were it or man:
And for the tithes that should be paid,
which were appointed than.
All these commandments before,
were given in mount Sinai:
With charges great them to observe,
from God the almighty.
Leuiticus is past and gone,
twenty and seven in all:
And Numeri ye shall have next,
the fourth book we it call.

Numeri.
The first Chapter.
APt unto battle those that were
from twenty years and more,
Are pointed out of all the tribes,
save Leuy kept in store.
Which tribe the Lord did take and choose,
to minister his will:
Such holy things as he had wild,
they must them all fulfill.
The ii. chapter.
BUild up ye tents how that they should
was told unto them tho:
The tabernacle round about,
each tribe his tent to know.
The heads and rulers of the hosts,
are named in their kind:
The Levites served in the mids,
as God had them assignde
The iii. chapter.
Choose out to battle might they not,
the Levites in their tribe:
For the first born the Lord them took,
and so set them on side.
To minister his holy things,
within the holy place:
And next thereto to build their shrouds,
they must in any case.
The iiii. chapter.
DEcree did God what they should do
their offices he told:
And further then he pointed them,
they not to be so bold.
Each one after his stock and kind,
full decently was set:
And every one to keep his course,
with outen stay or let.
The v. chapter.
Each issue, and the Lazar man,
might not among them dwell:
For wrongs then done, five fold restord
the law did them compel.
From company that was suspect,
to keep men's wives in awe:
There was set out of jealousy,
a good decree^ and law.
The vi. chapter.
FOr such as then did vow the vow,
of perfet abstinence:
The Lord almight their fare did point
to keep them from offense.
And also showed to Moses then,
the manner how Aaron:
Should bless the flock, saying the Lord,
bless and keep you each one.
The vii. chapter.
Gifts were given then of the Lords,
and heads of Israel:
Among them all there one was hight,
by name Nathaniel.
Great were the gifts that they did give
they spared for no cost:
In setting forth Gods service right,
they might with all men boste.
The viii. chapter.
HOw that the Lord would have the lamps
to Moses he did show:
The candlesticks in order fit,
where they were hie or low.
For clensing offering must be had,
the Levites they must use:
Which when they came to fifty years
offering they might not use:
The ix. chapter.
Justly ye time to keep their paske,
to Moses it was told:
And how the filde or foren man,
to offer might be bold.
He that denied to offer tho,
he must be made to die:
Both night and day a guide they had
a cloud and light from hie.
The x. chapter.
KNowledge such had the people tho,
by trumpets that were blown:
Were it in wars or time of peace
the sound to them was known.
From Sinai they did depart,
their captains numbered all:
And Iethro would not flit with them,
betide what might befall.
The xi. chapter.
LIke fools the people did complain,
and plagde they were with fire
With Manna cloyd, to Egypt back
for flesh was their desire.
Moses then did grieve the Lord,
whose burden he did ease:
On Quails they fed and killed they were
for God they did displease.
The xii. chapter.
MIriam then did grudge and swel,
at Moses God his judge:
And Aaron did consent thereto,
And so they both did grudge.
With leprosy was Miriam stroke,
to teach her to rebel:
At Moses prayer she was restorde,
and lived, and did full well.
The xiii. chapter.
NOtes to take of Canaan,
twelve men were thither sent:
To see the fatnes of the land,
therefore before they went.
Which came and told how rich it was,
with grapes a cluster great:
They told of Cities great and strong
which made them chafe and ^reat.
The xiiii. chapter.
OPinion had the people then,
that land not to obtain:
And grudge they did against the Lord
which would straight them have slain
Not one of all the Israelites,
the hest land did possess:
Save Iosue and Caleb both,
which two the Lord did bless.
The xv. chapter.
PRescribe did God a sacrifice,
for sins of ignorance:
But die they should that wilfully,
did sin by arogance.
Stand he was that gathered sticks,
upon the Sabbothe day:
Their garments guarded round about,
Gods hestes for to obey.
The xvi. chapter.
Quarrels picked certain that time,
and Chorath was the one:
Also Dathan and Abiron,
the fourth made up of On.
These did rebel against their heads,
And moved God to ire:
He causd the earth to swallowe them,
and burnt the rest with fire.
The xvii. chapter.
Receive a token of their evil,
immediately they did:
Twelve rods were brought from all the heads
as God him self did bid.
Among them all then Aarons rod,
did floorishe forth with buddes:
To teach them way the prechers then
for loosing of their bloods.
The xviii. chapter.
Such things as Levites then did use,
did God almighty point:
They were his priests to serve his will,
whom Aaron did anoint.
To whom the tithes and fruits were paid,
to maintain their degree:
And Aaron had an heritage,
as ye may read and see.
Eyghteen Chapters now here are past,
of Numeri by name:
And eyghteen more ye shall have next,
I trust in right good frame.

The xix chapter.
A Red cow then was bid to kill,
by Eliazer the priest:
To sparge her blood and burn her quite
as he full well it wist.
A law to keep the people clean,
from filthiness or spot.
No man to touch the holy place,
but he that was his lot.
The xx. chapter.
BEgin did Israel for to grudge,
they lacked drink to drink
Out of a rock there gusht a stream,
that filled them to the brink.
The Edomites would not let pass,
the people through their land:
Then Aaron did, and in his roum,
Eleazar did stand.
The xxi. chapter.
CAptain Arad then came to fight,
and lost his City and life:
Immediately when they were come,
even from the waters strife.
Then stung they were by serpents great
and heald by one on hie:
They killed two kings Schon and Og,
as Israel passed by.
The xxii. chapter.
Devise did Balack for to curse,
the Israelites to hell:
and sent for Balam in his fume,
his cursing for to tell.
^e once denide and ^et he went,
his mind was set on gain:
He smote his Ass and she denide,
his labor was in vain.
The xxiii. chapter.
Even as Balack had then decreed,
so went he up on hie:
And Balam talked with God a while,
and spoke thus by and by.
How shall I curse or else defy.
whom God does nothing so?
And them he blessed and blessed again,
or ever he did go.
The xxiiij. chapter.
Forth went Balam in parables,
declaring Isreal's hap:
And Balack angry with the thing,
his hands in one did clap.
When he had said then Balam told
of Christ's kingdom plain:
A Star and scepter up shall rise,
in Jacob for to reign.
The xxv. chapter.
GOds people then did slip away,
and whordome did commit
The Moabits in their service,
had tiste them unto it.
Then God commanded Moses straight,
to hang the rulers all:
As two were doing of the deed,
Phinches on them did fall.
The xxvi. chapter.
HOw many were the Israelites,
that Canaan should possess:
The whole xij. tribes are numbered all,
whom God did choose and bless.
He wild the land for to be dealt,
by parts in form equal:
The mo the more, the few the less
so that no one have all.
The xxvii. chapter.
IN presence then came certain maid^
inheritance to crave:
Even so they had as next of blood,
successively must have.
The land behest to Moses showed,
and told he is to die:
His prayer is heard and Iosue set,
his roum for to supply.
The xxviii. chapter.
KNowledge is given for every day,
what offering they must use:
A Lamb at morn and eke at even,
unspotted they must choose.
The paske how that it should be kept,
the day is pointed out:
With all the order of the feast,
to put them out of dout.
The xxix. chapter.
LIke sacrifice as God did point,
this chapter does express:
And tells how all their meats and drinks
in order they must dress.
Eight days at once they must not ceace
to offer sacrifise:
And woork no kind of woork in them
as God did them devise.
The xxx. chapter.
MEn that vowed or swear an oath,
with promise to the Lord:
Must stand to it and not go back,
the scripture does accord.
But maid or wife that did the same,
without their heds consent:
They must go back if he denide,
for all their good intent.
The xxxi. chapter.
NExt then to that went Israel forth,
the Madianites to kill:
And slew the males and burnt their towns
and led the rest at will.
The spoil was dealt forth equally,
the captains were so good:
Save certain things were given to God
for saving of their blood.
The xxxii. chapter.
Over Iordane toward the East,
possession out was set:
For two whole tribes and half a one
so that they would not let.
To go before their brethern all,
in harnes fresh and bright:
Against the land of Canaan,
to put them all to flight.
The xxxiii. chapter.
PErfourm did Moses Gods precept
Their iourneis he did write:
From place to place in wilderness,
and tells where they did light
Then God did bid that they should kill,
the Cananites out right:
And ding their chapels all adown
and burst their Idols quite.
The xxxiiii. chapter.
QUietly how they should possess,
the land is told them plain:
The east, the west, the north, the south,
where they should rule and reign.
Who should point out the land by lots,
the Lord did Moses tell:
The heds should set out each man's part
where he should bide and dwell.
The xxxv. chapter.
REsight did God the Leuits lots
the suburbs and their towns:
For refuge certain Cities set,
to keep them in their bounds:
He that with will a man did kill,
he must of right be slain:
One witness may in no wise stand,
unless that they be twain.
The xxxvi. chapter.
SUpplication then was made,
for maids that were vnwed:
Within their tribe then must they take*
their husband and their head.
Every tribe within his tribe,
must wed and take his wife.
Not one to mix in others part,
for fear of bate and strife.
Now Numeri has thus his end,
the fourth book it is set:
The fifth in order ye shall have,
If God give us no let.

Deuteronomium.
Not only so but also teach,
their children they are bod:
The Lords precepts both all and some
that they may know their God.
The vii. chapter.
GOd did forbid a league to make,
with gentiles in no wise:
They must destroy their Idols quite,
and all their Gods despise.
He also says that he will bless,
the keepers of his will:
And curse the rest and charge he gave,
Idolatrers to kill.
The viii. chapter.
HOw maruaylously that God had de^^,
with Israel forty year:
In wilderness with benefits,
as plainly does appear.
They are commanded not to say
their might did them defend:
But that the Lord did bring them forth,
and gave their foes their end.
The ix. chapter.
IN any case they are forbod,
to trust in their own strength:
For who so does him will betide,
a faule to have at length.
Moses then a rehearsal made,
full breefly in a sum:
From time they had receiude the law
til they to lust begun.
The x. Chapter.
Know here ye may of Isreal's walk,
whiles they in journey went:
And how the tables were renewed,
when they were broke and rent.
Nothing the Lord did then require
for doing them such good:
But that they hold all his precepts
and set thereon their mood.
The xi. chapter.
Love they must now ye Lord his law
still Moses gave them charge
With heart and mind they must him serve,
that had set them at large.
To talk thereof when that they rise
or at their ^^tting down:
Or else in journey as they walk
in feeld be it or town.
The xii. chapter.
Moses once more so gave them charge
against Idolatry:
It to suppress and put it down,
and from the same to flee:
And blood to eat they are forbod,
in any manner wise:
And only do as God them bad,
and not what like their eyes.
The xiii. chapter.
NO Prophet false must bide on live,
but must be made to die:
And wicked folk must not be heard,
though in thy breast they lie.
God for to try the Israelites*
how strong they were in faith
Would suffer things to prove them with
as Moses plainly says.
The xiiij. chapter.
OMit they must the Gentiles trades,
and flee their doings quite:
And only serve almighty God,
with all their main and might:
Such beasts as they might not then (...)
are manifestly told:
And which were clean is there expressed
that eat they might be bold.
The xv. chapter.
PArdon their de^s then are they bod
at every seventh years end:
When God his will is served and kept
no scarsenes he will send.
Those that will lend to such as need,
the manner is told how
Deformity in sacrifice,
the Lord does not allow.
The xvi. chapter.
QUietly how to keep their feasts
the times are told them plain:
When that they should be used and kept
is written once again.
O that Judges would mark and read,
and do as God there bad:
To take no gifts in any case,
but justice to be had.
The xvii. chapter.
REwarded must Idolaters,
with death by law to die:
And (...) things must be reserd
to those that be on hie.
Presumptuous men that do rebel,
must die the law does minge:
The man and state that he must keep
that they would take to king.
Half this book is now told before,
in seauenteen chapters just:
And seauenteen more ye shall have next,
in God put we our trust.

The xviij. chapter.
ALl the Levites the which were priests,
might no possessions have:
All sorcery they must avoid,
their lives to keep and save.
Moses told then of Christ to come,
and bad them him to hear:
The Prophet false they must not way,
nor all his doings fear.
The xix. chapter.
BEcause that murder might be done,
against the dooers mind:
For refuge, Cities were set out,
and there unto assignd.
The false witness must have the stone,
return to his own brow:
An eye for eye, and tooth for tooth,
the law did them allow.
The xx. chapter.
Choose out for wars what men they should
this chapter does express:
The law of arms to them is told,
to use in war or peace.
The Cananites, the Pheresites,
the Iebusites also:
With Heuites eke they must destroy*
not letting one to go.
The xxj. chapter.
DEcree did God a goodly law,
for him that was found dead:
And how the Jew should him behave,
a gentile for to wed.
The first borne son he must possess,
the heritage and land:
The child that parents does not fear,
must die even out of hand.
The xxii. chapter.
Each man must help his neighbors Ass
although he be unknown:
The man denied the woman's tire,
she to go in her own.
Lin^^e wolu^e might not be worn,
the adulterer must die:
And order taken for that man,
that with a maid did lie.
The xxiii. chapter.
FOrbidden was the gelded man
in Christ's church to dwell:
The harlots bird does God command,
that they should quite expel.
There might no whore among the^ bide,
the Lord did so decree:
The love of things is there denide,
to lend on usury.
The xxiiii. chapter.
Give leave did Moses to deuorce,
for causes that were light:
The newly spousd they might not force
in battle for to fight.
For money lent and servants hire,
a goodly lesson told:
Some leysing left in feeld and town,
for poor folk yung and old.
The xxv. chapter.
HOw many stripes the trespasser,
should have for wicked life:
A man that died without a son,
his brother should wed his wife:
That weightes and mesures should be iu^^,
read ye the chapters end:
Who so does use the contrary,
shall come to wicked end.
The xxvi. chapter.
Justly must they now pay their fruits,
that first to them did fall
The tithes they were commanded to,
they should then pay them all,
Unto the priests, the fatherles,
the stranger and widow:
Such goods were then the poores of right
how so they use them now.
The xxvii. Chapter.
KNowledge was had the people the^
an altar up to rear:
Before that Iordane they did pass,
or came the land so near.
The curses then that Leuy was
commanded for to speak:
Against all those that did delight,
Gods will to burst or break.
The xxviii. Chapter.
Lovingly the Lord did bless,
the keepers of his will:
To stablishe them in their good minds
to keep them in it still.
And curse does he the contrary,
with cursings very great:
Those that him love he does them bless
his haters he does threat.
The xxix. chapter.
Moses then went and thus he spoke,
unto the people all:
Saying to such as fears God,
the Lord defends them all.
But they that not regard his will,
such plagues on them shall come:
As like has not been seen on earth,
from rising of the son.
The xxx. chapter.
NOt far from them that do it seek
is Gods almighty word:
Those that it love and it obey,
are saved from the sword.
Within our mouths and in our hearts
the word is always pressed:
Those that it keep are sure at length,
for it they shall be blessed.
The xxxi. chapter.
Old was Moses and so did choose,
then Iosue in his steed:
To whom he said see thou be strong,
and have no fear or dread.
This book he wrote and did it give,
into the Levites hand:
And chargde that they the same should read,
when they came to the land.
The xxxii. chapter.
PLesantly then did Moses sing
a goodly song of praise:
Unto the Lord for all the acts,
that he had wrought always,
And up he went unto a hill,
to look on Canaan:
God bad him there to run the race,
that all his fathers ran.
The xxxiii. chapter.
QUietly Moses did prepare,
to sleep his fathers sleep
But this he said before he went,
that God his saints does keep.
Also he blessed all the tribes,
before his dying day:
And told how they should rule and reign,
if they did God obey.
The xxxiiii. chapter.
REst from his woork did Moses then
and so gave up the ghost:
At his departing they did weep
even throughout all the host.
And Iosue did his roum possess
as Moses had it wild:
And ruled all the Israelites,
in City and in feeld.
Of Moses books here is the last,
as he did them all write:
Unto the Lord give ye the praise,
which is the God of might.

Iosue.
The j. Chapter.
AS God before had Moses called
his people for to guide:
So Iosue to supply his roum,
the Lord set him on side.
For to be strong the Lord him bad,
and manly for to fight:
And from the laws of God the Lord,
to turn to left nor right.
The ii. chapter.
BEfore were serchers sent to spy,
to Ierico they yede:
A harlots house they lodged in,
by whom then they were hid.
She made them promise her to save
when spoild should be the land:
And they agreed to know her house,
by purple cord or band.
The iii. chapter.
CAre to Joshua did belong,
the people for to guide:
Remove he did from Settim ground,
and came to Iordane side:
Then was the Lord disposde to show,
the honor of his name.
He caused Iordain waters yield,
and part a sunder twain.
The iiij. Chapter.
DEcree did God that his good woork
should not be out of mind:
And causd each tribe to rear a stone,
as monumentes behind.
And if their children art the cause,
why these twelve stones stood there:
Then should they tell what God had done
to make his name appear.
The v. chapter.
EEhe one of all the Cananites,
were fraid when they hard tell
How Iordane brook did part in two,
whiles over went Israel.
Then God commanded Iosue,
to circumcise them all:
And all the males with sharp stone knives,
were cut both great and small.
The vj. chapter.
FEarful then were the Cananites,
of Isreal's power and might:
At seven days end as God had said,
the walls did fall down quite.
Consumde was all with sword and fire,
save vessels few reserude:
And Rahab saved with all her kin,
which well she had deserude.
The vii. chapter.
GOd then was angry with his flock,
at Ai took they the foil:
Because that Acan Carmies son,
had borne away some spoil.
A garment gay with silver much,
a rung of gold thereto:
Because it was forbid of God,
he had death with stones enough.
The viii. chapter.
Have you no fear said God but go
and fight against Ai:
Thou shall it take and have some spoil,
and all the rest destroy.
So Iosue went as God him bad,
and fought, but fled a while:
The rest did set the town on fire,
so them they did begile:
The ix. chapter.
Immediately the Cananites,
with all the heathen Kings:
They came to fight as soon as they,
of Joshua had tidings.
The Gabanites dissembling parts,
with Israel they did play:
Because the heads had sworn to them,
they were not made away.
The x. chapter.
KIngs that were in number five
with Israel they did fight:
At Gabaon siege with all their hosts
there were they put to flight.
The Sun stood still a whole day length
and hail did beat them down:
Five kings were slain and hanged up,
so wan they town by town.
The xi. chapter.
LIke hap had all the other kings,
and sudainly were slain:
And Hezor burnt and none but it
that stood above the plain.
Not one word then was left undone
as Moses had him wild:
But Joshua did fulfill it all,
were he in town or field.
The xii. chapter.
MAny battails Israel fought,
ere Iordane they did pass:
To two whole tribes and half a one,
their land appointed was.
The kings are told and numbered all,
that Joshua did subdue.
Thirty and one in number just,
whom they both took and slew*
The xiii. chapter.
NOte out the land as Joshua wild,
by lots it to divide:
He being agde so god him bad,
to set and point each tribe.
Ruben and Gad, and half the tribe,
of Manasses by name:
Were pointed plats for to posses,
by Moses set in frame.
The xiiij. chapter.
OF Joshua Caleb did require,
the City Hebron walld:
Which was possessed by Enakes kind
a Giant was he called.
Four score years and five he was,
when he requirde his ground:
And yet he said he was as strong,
as when the land he found.
The xv. chapter.
POinted out was Judah his lot,
the Cities told full straight:
The villages not named out,
but towns five score and eight.
For killing of a Giant great,
a man did mary a wife:
The Iebusites among the folk,
did still lead on their life.
The xvj. chapter.
QUickly Ephraim so had his lot
in length and breadth assignde:
Even as a tribe he had his part,
according to his mind.
And tribute paid the Cananites,
and with them did they dwell:
Although the Lord had said before,
that they should them expel.
The xvii. chapter.
RIght as before that Ephraim,
had out his part of land:
Even so Manasses had his lot,
where he and his should stand*
And certain women had likewise,
as they did it require:
And Joseph's house would have more land
but had not their desire
The xviii. chapter.
Seven tribes agreed to send their spies
as Iosue had them wild:
Of each tribe three went forth to see,
the Cities and the feeld.
And in a book in seven parts writ
to Joshua brought they word:
And he appointed them their plats,
by lots before the Lord.
The xix. chapter.
TO Zabulon and Izachar,
and Aser being tenth:
To Nepthali and Dan the last,
was pointed bredthe and length.
^o Joshua with Eleaser,
and all the Lords and heds:
Did make an end of casting lots,
and pointing out their stedes.
The xx. chapter.
WHen they had done and cast their lots
then God to Iosue said:
^or him that killes a man unawares,
point Cities for their aid.
And they therein to dwell and live,
til the hie priest does die:
The sword of blood not him to touch,
if thither he do flee.
The xxj. chapter.
ANd then the heads of the Levites,
their portion did require:
And so they had their whole request
even as they did desire.
Forty and eight in Cities just,
their whole tale came thereto*
As God them gave the land and rest,
as he them plight to do.
The xxii. chapter.
Both of the tribes and eke the (...)
yode back as they were sent:
Ruben, Gad with Manasses,
to their possession went.
An altar made, and Israel fluckt
against them for to fight:
When they heard tell why it was built,
they said the deed was right.
The xxiii. chapter.
CAst in age was Joshua tho,
and Israel he did call:
And showed the^ what the Lord had done,
and told it to them all.
Much more he said that God would do
if in his will they bide:
If not he told them plain before,
that they should be destroyed.
The xxiiii. chapter.
DEclare on forth he did at large
what God had for them wrought
And bad them serve the Lord alone
which thither had them brought.
So speak they did with often voice,
the only Lord to fear:
And Joshua did and Joseph's bones,
were earth and buried there.
Joshua now is ended quite,
the book has run his race:
The book of Judges now begins,
in like to take his place.

Sophtim: Iudicum: Judges.
The first Chapter:
AHead to have they did desire,
in Iosuas roum to be:
And Judah to them pointed was,
who fought full manfully.
Jerusalem they took and wan,
great Giants did they slay:
The Gentiles with them still did dwell
but tribute did they pay.
The ii. chapter.
BEcause they did not kill them all
an Angel did them chide:
And Joshua dead they buried him,
down by his fathers side.
When that stock all was dead and gone,
full wicked were the next:
And served Gods that were forbod,
whose names are in the text.
The iii. chapter.
CErtain nations then are named,
that with them then did dwell:
But one them killed and bet them down
named Othoniel:
Yet after that they were oppressed,
but Ahud them did save:
For in a parlour with the King,
his deaths wound he him gave.
The iiii. chapter.
DEpart did yet the flock and went,
and served Idols vain:
Of Iabin King of Canaan,
years twenty were they slain.
And Debora then did them judge,
whom Barack she did call:
They fought and wan, but Sisara
In Iaels hands did fall.
The v. chapter.
Even as the battle ended was
and Israel had the best:
They sang a song of melody,
wherein the Lord was blessed.
But cursed were some that came not forth
to help them for to fight:
And blessed was she that with a nail
slew Sisara outright.
The vi. chapter.
FAre foul did then the Madianites,
with Israel for their sin:
An Angel stird up Gedeon,
their freedom for to win.
The Idol Ball he did destroy,
and burst his altar down*
His Father did his cause defend,
against the City or town.
The vii. Chapter.
GEdeon forth to battle went,
the Madianites to kill:
To mickle was his host (said God),
for him to have his will.
So many as feared were sent home back
and those that stoupt to drink:
Three hundred slew the Madianites,
and made their kings to shrink.
The viii. chapter.
Half angry were the Ephraites,
but Gedeon did them still:
Phanuel men and Sucoth both,
did Gedeon take and kill.
Two kings he slew and then they would,
have him and his their heds:
He it denide, but gave them cause,
to do full wicked deeds.
The ix. Chapter.
IEroboas had three score sons,
and ten in number true:
Abimeleck he killed them all,
save Ioathan the Jew.
Who them rebukte, they did him choose,
and Gaal rose in vain:
So Sichem burnt and Thebez stroyd
Abimeleck there was slain.
The x. chapter.
Know well ye may what guide they had,
as Gods that were forbod:
They were oppressed and did repent,
and called unto God.
Who bad them call unto their Gods
in trouble them to save:
They did suppress their Idols quite,
to God their minds they gave.
The xi. chapter.
LOok out did then the Galadites,
a captain and a guide:
Who willed Ammon not to fight
but he his tale denide.
Then Iephthath vowed a foolish vow
the victory to obtain:
He had the feeld and home returned,
then was his daughter slain.
The xii. chapter.
MUrmour so did the Ephraites,
at Iepthah had they spite
Forty thousand of them he slew,
and put the rest to flight.
A word betrayed them many times,
when Iordane they would take:
Three Judges there, are then expressed,
and when their lives did slake.
The xiii. chapter.
NO longer did they fear the Lord,
then Judges good did live:
The upper hand against them all
the Lord their foes did give.
A man that was hight Manoah,
had Samson to him plight:
His wife him bare as God had said,
with him dwelt God his sprite.
The xiiij. chapter.
OF Samsons marriage ye may hear
he would needs have his will:
As he went down his spouse to woo,
a Lion did he kill.
A ridle axt and thirty men,
he slew to pay the hest:
His calfe had tilde the thirties land,
and went to his fellows nest.
The xv. chapter.
PAstime to make then Samson went
to banquet with his wife:
She went not in so sprang a cause,
of hatred and great strife.
With Foxes fiery he brent their corn,
Philistians did he slay:
The iaw bone of an Ass he took,
and thousands killed one day.
The xvi. chapter.
Quarrel they picked to Samson still,
and him they watch to slay:
But he that night burst up their gates,
and carried them away.
He kept a whore who being feed,
his strength of him she wan:
When he was blind they causd him play
but he destroyed them than.
The xvii. chapter.
REherst is then of money lost,
a woman did it miss:
Micha her son did it confess
and said lo here it is.
Uowed she had and would it keep,
an Image did she make:
Leuite came and lodged there,
whom Micha his priest did make.
The xviii. chapter.
SPies were sent to search the land,
the tribe of Dan it wrought:
At Michas house they lodgd all night
where council good they sought.
Return they did with joyful news,
and forth they went to fight:
The priest and Image they did take,
and wan the land out right.
The xix. chapter.
TO mary against the law of God
see what does them betide:
A Levites wife did play the whore,
and flipped from her guide.
He fetched her home and as he went,
at Gabaah was she slain:
Then sent he her in pieces twelve
the deed for to complain.
The xx. chapter.
UP then rose Israel for to fight,
against the Beniamites:
For whoredom fact, yet Israel was
put unto two great flightes.
Then did they pray and God the^ plight,
to have the higher hand:
The Beniamites were killd on morn
twenty and five thousand.
The xxj. chapter.
ANd the^ they swear that none of them,
the Beniamites should wed:
The men that went not up to fight
they vowed them but dead.
They took their daughters and the^ gave
the Beniamites to make:
Yet not suffisde the dancing dames
to wives they did them take.
The book of Judges is expirde,
an end thereof is made:
The story of Ruthe ye shall have next,
so following scriptures trade.

Ruthe.
The first Chapter.
A Dearth then fell in Iudaes land
Emeleck with his wife:
And his two sons to Moab went,
there for to lead their life.
The father died and his two sons,
in marriage did also:
The mother then did home return,
and Ruthe with her did go.
The ii. chapter.
BEseech did Ruthe her mother in law,
That she some corn might lease;
And forth she went to Booz his field
whose sight she did well please.
He both inquierd and with her talkte
and her entreated well:
See told her mother at the night,
the story every dele.
The iii. chapter.
CAused she was by Noemise words,
to sleep at Booz his feet:
Who when he wakte and felt her there
the truth on her did weet.
She told him all and who she was
then bad he her lie still:
And on the morn he gave her corn
and told her all his will.
The iiij. chapter.
DOwn sat Booz then and in the gate
his kinsman did he call:
He showed to him before the heads,
what land to him did fall.
He said he would not purchase it,
so Booz the land did buy:
And married Ruthe who had a son.
when he with her did lie.
Ruthe does end at Chapters four,
showing whom she did wed:
A Gentile she was, yet she bare,
the Graunsire to David.
The first of Kings ye shall have now,
whom Samuel some do call:
The stories shall declare you how,
that Kings to them did fall.

The first book of Samuel otherwise called the first of the Kings.
The first Chapter.
A Man two wives had wedded tho,
the one no children had:
She had such woe she praid to God,
who sent to her a lad.
Elkanah was her husbands name,
and Hannah was she hight:
And Samuel did she call her son
whom she to God had plight.
The ii. chapter.
BEgin did Hannah for to sing,
and sang a goodly song:
The sons of Ely were unthrifts
and did the people wrong.
Ely them did rebukte but small,
for which God did him chide:
He sent a man to tell him plain
his house should be destroyed.
The iii. chapter.
COnsumde was Elies sight away,
and as he lay and slept:
Samuel thrice the Lord did call,
who unto Ely s^ept.
^ call thee not it is the Lord,
do thou to him obey:
And so he did, and Ely knew,
on him what God did say.
The iiii. chapter.
DOughtely fought the Israelites
yet were they put to flight:
The Philistian host twice bet the^ down
and took their Ark by might.
The sons of Ely they were killed,
which when their father hard:
He fell out of his seat for woe,
and burst his neck backward.
The v. chapter.
EArly arose the Asdodits,
their Dagon for to see*
The Ark of God twice thrue him down,
and bated his degree.
Stricken they were with Emerodes
the Ark made them full woe:
From whence it came they did decree,
thither to let it go.
The vj. chapter.
FUlly and whole they did consent,
that home the Ark should wend:
With mise and arses made of gold,
so home they did it send
Two kine new milche did carry it
the right way home they went
The Bethsanites they it receiude,
for which they were all shent.
The vii. chapter.
GOD willed Israel that they should,
their Idols quite destroy:
By Samuels mouth and they confessed
their sins to him on hie.
They willed Samuel for to pray,
the enemies they did fear:
They were destroyed and fought no more
the space of many a year.
The viii. chapter.
HOw Samuels sons did wickedly
the people did it ming:
And not content of Samuel,
they did desire a king.
He them denide and axt the Lord
who did to them consent:
And bad him tell what he would do,
when he one to them sent.
The ix. chapter.
IT came to pass that Saul Cis son,
his Asses went to find:
The Sear fondee he did inquire,
who told him all his mind.
Thy Asses they are found, and thou
the Israelites must guide:
He feasted him and on the morn,
he took him sole on side.
The x. chapter.
Kiss did Samuel and anoint,
then Saul to be their King:
And told him things which came to pass
as he before did ming.
^o Prophecy he did and told,
his uncle half his hap:
The lot did fall to Saul as King,
And unthrifts grudgd thereat.
The xi. chapter.
LAy siege to Iabes Nahas did,
which was an Ammonite:
They did submit he sent them word,
their eyes to thrust out quite.
Then seven days respite they did take
then aid less they would yield.
So Saul did win the peoples hearts
in winning of the feeld.
The xii. chapter.
MArk my words said Samuel then,
your wills I have obayed:
If I did wrong or taken bribe,
it shall again be paid.
How God had done in time before,
and would do he them told:
With thunder and rain he feared all,
and sharply them controlde.
The xiii. Chapter.
NOw Saul being king, he got him men
against his foes to fight:
And when the host drue near to Saul,

that Samuel should have done,
A Smith to make them tools to fight,
in Israel had they none.
The xiiii. chapter.
Over with one then Ionathas went
his sign was true they fled
When Saul it knew with all his men,

If any did eat ere night were come
then die he should said Saul:
Ionathas eat and should have did,
the host denide it all.
The xv. chapter.
POinted was Saul of Gods own, mouth
the Amalakites to kill:
He disobayd the almighty Lord,
and folowd his foolish will.
Then Samuel showed him how that God,
was sorry he made him king:
Obedience more he looks to have,
then any burnt offering.
Half Samuels first book ye have had,
some say the first of Kings:
VVherin is showed the meruaylous woorks,
of God in his doings.
Of David's calling to be King,
Samuel did him anoint:
It shall be showed you afterward,
the Chapters shall it point.

The xvi. Chapter.
APoint did God that Samuel should
choose David to be King:
For fear of Saul he went in close,
and faind an offering.
So David being chosen king,
an evil sprite came on Saul:
When David came and played on harp,
the sprite went out of Saul.
The xvij. chapter.
BOldly bragged Goliath then
on his great might and strength
None durst go out to cope with him,
til David came at length,
Proffer he did to fight with him,
yet harnes had he none.
A sling he had and out he went,
and killed him with a stone.
The xviii. chapter.
COme out did women and did sing
in joy of enemies fall:

To have his death, Michol he gave,
to be his spoused wife.
The xix. chapter.
Devise did Saul still David's death,
for all the oath he swear:
And when he played to void the sprite

Then in his house he had been slain,
but Michol causd him flee:
And they him sought, Saul and his men
began to prophecy.
The xx. chapter.
Eftsoons David and Ionathas,
compact their faiths in one:
If Saul him mist and were displeasd

Then Saul fell out with Ionathas,
that void was David's place:
Then by a sign he gave him word,
to flee in any case.
The xxi. chapter.
Flee from Saul then David did,
to Ahimelech he came:
The ^ewbread suttely he obtaind,
but by was Saul's herdman.
The Philistians sword he got also,
to Achis king he went:
He was afraid he faind him mad,
the King was not content.
The xxii. chapter.
GO forth does David on his way,
the oppressed to him did come:
He left his kindred with a King,
and went away with some.
Doeg told of Abimelech,
for whom Saul sent and slew:
And all the house and Town also,
save one that ^led the crew.
The xxiii. Chapter.
HElp did David a City besiegd
Reylah it was called:
And Saul well hopte to kill him there
it was a City walld.
In a thicket he was betrayed,
Saul thought him to have spoild:
The straight was great David was in
but Saul then home recoild.
The xxiiij. chapter.
IN danger great was Saul the king
in cave so it did hap:
If David would he had been slain,

So Saul swear David to be good,
to him in his kingdom.
The xxv. chapter.
Know ye may of Samuels death*
and Naball his sheep shearing:
Who angered David very much,
his churlishe part once hearing.
If Abigail had him not met,
they had then lost their life:
Immediately the fool did die,
and David had his wife.

so writ of him ye have.
The xxviii. chapter.
Heir to Iotham was Ahaz King,

The more he felt the worse he dealt,
a better ruled next.
The xxjx. chapter.
IN royal state Hezekia,

The xxx. chapter.
KNowledge was given by letters sent,
the paske for to be kept:

And if the King had not stepped in,
some had of God been beaten.
The xxxi. chapter.
LOok what became converted men
was done as men reuiude:

wholly upon their charge:
Their wives and sons were cared for,
they had all things at large.
The xxxii. chapter.
MUltitudes of soldiers came,
then out of Assure land:

and died in great fame.
The xxxiii. chapter.
NOt well, but evil, Manasses reignd,

and for it were they slain.
The xxxiiii. chapter.
OF Josias how well he ruled,
here now to you is told:

As he was wild, he served God
so did likewise a number.
The xxxv. chapter.
Passover was then held and kept,
Josias so it bad:
From Samuels days before that time

He needs would fight with Egypt King
yet Necho him forbad:
So slain he was and burial made,
his flock with mourning clad.
The xxxvi. chapter.
QUite quenched was the law of God
King after King it foild:
Some were put down, some captive led
their temple eke was spoild.
They warned, mocked, to Babylon,
so were they led as sheep:
At seventy years they did return,
so Cirus thought it meet.
Thus ended are the Chronicles.
two books they do contain:
The Jews in one compile them both,
to long, we make them twain.
When Esdras came from Babylon,
the kingly acts destroyed:
He pend these writs of breef rehearse,
no man has them anoid.

The first book of Esdras.
The first Chapter.
AS spoken was by Jeremy,
so Cirus Persia King:
Commanded Jews home to return
all such as were willing.
Their vessels eke he did them give,
of gold and silver numbered:
Five thousand were they in their tale
and yet thereto four hundred.
The ii. chapter.
BEing so wild as thick as Bees,
the Jews from thence depart:
In numbers great to Judah land,
they go with all their heart.
Fifty thousand, not many less,
of souls to Judah went:
Zorobabel he was the cheef,
whom Cirus thither sent.
The iii. chapter.
COme home again into their land
the temple overthrown:
They do begin to build again,
the trumpets they are blown.
And sacrifice they daily make,
the ground woork now is laid:
Some sing, some shout, some weep for joy
each one is well apaid.
The iiii. chapter.
DIssembling men pretended help,
to build they were forbid:
Then let they all Cirus time,
the building s^owely yed.
Darius reignd, to whom they writ,
much slaundering the Jews:
Who writ again and did forbid
such building for to use.
The v. chapter.
Eftsoons they build so Prophets wild,
the cause was asked and why
They answer made that they had leave
God let them to deny.
Then wrote their foes unto the King,
the woork they did detest:
What Cirus wild, that would they do
to hear they were full pressed.
The vi. chapter.
Found out for truth is Cirus grant,
and he does it revive:
The hindrers of the woork he bids
of life them to deprive.
His house should eke a dunghill be
such charge he writ again:
Then builded is the temple up,
and offerings thick are slain.
The vii chapter.
GOd made the King Artaxersis
so well Esdras to love:
That he him sent to Judah land,
to serve the Lord above.
Such letters eke with him he gave
as worthy are to read:
A foreign prince, a heathen man,
the God above did dread.
The viii. chapter.
HUndredes now do flock and come
with Esdras home to go:
The Levites lackt, he sent for some,
their wealth he did them show.
A fast was cride for aid to God,
they shamde to ask a guard:
So past they forth so home they came,
their bown above was heard.
The ix. chapter.
IN raging wise when Esdras heard,
that gentile wives were kept:
He rent his clothes he rare his beard,
and sorowfully he wept,
When evening came he prayers made
most humbly unto God:
To stay his hand to stop his wrath,
to keep away his rod.
The x. chapter.
KNowledge they gave to Esdras tho,
that sore they did repent:
Their heathen brides for to forgo,
they were right well content.
The multitude are called up,
the raigny plague is ^ore.
Such as offend they grant to mend,
Judges are set therefore.
Thus ended is now the first book,
which Esdras has to name:
The second eke is called so,
because he writ the same.
Noehemiah yet some it call:
because of him it treats,
You shall hear how the building fares,
for all the wicked threats.

The second book of Esdras.
The first Chapter.
ASking for news from Jury land,
Nehemiah astond:
The City rackt and burnt adown
he shright and lowdly moend.
Him self alone with weeping fast,
he praid to God almight:
His prayer did tend grace for to find,
in Aasuerus sight.
The ii. Chapter.
BUtler unto the King he was,
and sadly did he wait:
The King him asked and he him told,
then pasport had he straight.
When to Jerusalem he came,
he vewd the whole decay:
Then cheerfully went forth the woork,
he would have no denay.
The iii. chapter.
COmpanies now in order built,
each one he took his place:
Some of good will, some in despite
the woork went on apace.
Of all estates laid to their hand,
the building to advance*
And last of all the Goldesmiths build
and so do the merchants.
The iiii. chapter.
DEadly hate the enemies took,
that still the Jews did build:
They scornd and mocked, they did conspire,
unawares to give them feeld.
Their treason wrought came to the Jews
so were they pressed to fight:
Their foes were blank so soldier like,
they wrought and wacht by night.
The v. chapter.
Each man cride out, ye dearth was great
they pledgd their land for bread:
The rich oppressed the poor full sore
of God they had no dread.
It was redrest, Nehemiah
got pardon for the gaged:
He lived without the peoples fee,
all thing was well eswaged.
The vi. chapter.
Full suttlely wrought the heathen then
Nehemiah to kill:
They sent for him full often with craft,
he went not them until.
The Prophets false would him afraid,
in faith he finished all:
Some bearing rule had hollow hearts
I think and ever shall.
The vii. chapter.
Guarded now is Jerusalem,
with watch and eke with ward
They are found out that first went up,
their names are red and heard.
Some were put out their kin forworn,
and some found right in blood:
Both rich and poor gave to the kark,
it came to mickle good.
The viii. chapter.
Having now done the woork as ought,
the law to them is read:
The people wept and mourned sore,
of God they were in dread.
The teachers the^ with gladsome words
their fearfulnes remooues:
The rulers all came for to hear,
their feast was kept in boothes.
The ix. chapter.
IN fasting and in prayer both,
with sack clothe mourningly:
The people do their alien wives,
forsake most willingly.
A godly prayer the priests do make
Gods wunders to set out:
How merciful he was to them,
though still they had been stout
The x. chapter.
Known out were now how many would
and eke thereto subscribe:
That they would have the covenant kept,
the cheef of every tribe:
The things are told: whereto they swear
to keep with all their heart:
They do protest with full consent,
they nil from them depart.
The xi. chapter.
LOts then were cast in every ten,
one should appointed be:
Jerusalem to make his shroud,
they did thereto agree.
So are they told from tribe to tribe,
who did the city keep:
The res^due abroad did dwell,
in towns as folded sheep.
The xii. chapter.
MAny there were that did return,
home with Zorobabel:
Priests and Leuits their names in course
this Chapter does you ^el.
And eke how that the wall thereto,
they do it dedicate:
With ranks beset with singing men
with lauds from gate to gate.
The xiii. chapter.
NOw on that day the law was read,
that strangers were forbod:
To mix among the Iewishe sect,
and so from them they yod.
The Saboth day they did not keep,
the ruler it refourmd:
And double men with heathen babes,
with speed such out he turned*
Nehemiah thus finisheth,
the second some it call:
Of Esdras now, and Esther next,
in course to you shall fall.
This proverb here is true ifound,
the wicked makes his gin:
To catch the just, but he him self,
is trapt and caught therein.

The book of Esther.
The first Chapter.
AHasuerus or Darius,
for so some do him call:
A royal feast he princely kept,
to cheer both great and small.
The Queen sent for to come in sight,
she did send ^lat her nay:
She is deuorst and law is made,
each wife for to obey.
The ii. chapter.
Being appeased of his wrath,
the King had counsel then:
That virgins should be chosen out,
the fairst among women.
So were they chose and purified,
with garments gayly dressed:
The King had choice which should be Queen
so Esther likte him best.
The iii. chapter.
COurted now is a wicked man
that Haman hight by name:
Who wanting glory to his will,
he sought a bloody fame.
By false report he got consent,
the Jews to kill and slay:
The posts were sent to every cost,
and pointed was the day.
The iiii. chapter.
DOleful cries and shouts were made,
the Jews were so aghast:
Mardocheus to Court he came,
the Queen was sore abasht.
She sent him word to fast and pray
and so to will the rest:
Her life she should in danger put,
yet was she thereto pressed.
The v. Chapter.
Esther then in her best array,
came forth before the King:
He likt her well and Septer showed,
to testify the thing.
The King did to her banquet go,
and Haman with him took:
Who coming home unto his house
full wicked council took.
The vi. Chapter.
FOund out it was Mardocheus,
the King had saved vnfeed:
Who Haman axt what such a one,
should have unto his meed?
In goodly robes to ride says he,
with honor and with praise:
To Mardocheus said the King,
go do the same straight ways.
The vii. Chapter.
Gone to banquet is Haman now,
to drink his last carrouse:
The Queen then told her doleful hap,
to her and to her house.
Unto the King, who rose in wrath
against Haman for the fact:
His gallous for another made,
his neck therein it cracked.
The viii. chapter.
HAmans house Merdocheus had,
his office thereunto:
The Queen did beg her peoples life,
the King did grant thereto
The posts were sent the joy was great,
the Jews had such releef:
The woork of God on them so wrought,
made some of their belief.
The ix. chapter.
IN like as should the Jews have had
so on their foes it fell:
For some were slain, some hanged on tree
the King did like it well.
Then did they point that day to keep,
holy from year to year:
With lauds and praise, with deeds of alms,
as there it does appeer.
As Esthers book is finished,
so Job ye shall have next:
The patient man, we will you show,
according to the text.
No Jew he was, but gentile born,
yet did he walk aright:
He was before that Moses was,
who did this book indight.

The book of Job.
The first Chapter:
A Man there was that dwelt in Hus,
and Job they did him call:
Of riches great, who Satan spoild,
and re^t it from him all.
His Children eke, God gave him leave,
with fire to send them hence:
Yet for all this, he could not break
Job of his patience.
The ii. Chapter.
BIles and foul sores upon his flesh
to vex him worse and worse:
The Devil got leave to plague him with
the mighty Lord to curse.
His wife also, who should have been,
his stay and eke comfort:
She counseld him to curse the Lord,
his friends did him exhort.
The iii. chapter.
CUrsed now be the day said Job,
wherein that I was born:
For naught is here but wretchedness
our labor is forlorn.
They are in bliss that graued be,
their sorrows then are done:
He wished the pit his house had been,
when life he first begoon.
The iiii. chapter.
Do thou then said one Elephas,
wax faint, which here tofore:
To such as were in trouble like,
have been to them a lore?
The Lord will do what pleases him,
there is none just but he:
The Angels macht, unto their God
vnpure are found to be.
The v. chapter.
ELiphas still proceeds forth,
with patience him to arm:
He proves the wicked in their wealth
have soon come unto harm.
And how the just continually,
from God have their defense:
He tells Job his happy state,
before that he go hence.
The vi. chapter.
Full sore in sores Job does reply,
confessing he is weak:
And wishing death rebuking such
as to him would not speak.
And eke to such as taunted him,
he liked not their talk:
He proves that in word and deed
he righteously did walk.
The vii. chapter*
GO on our days we do on eart^
as shadows, or as clouds:
And sudenly we leave behind
our empty framed shrouds*
Both night and day they have their to^*
with woork and dreams itost:
Wherefore if God did not us keep,
so were we surely lost.
The viii. chapter.
HElp is there none said Bildad the,
for thee in thy distress:
But prayers to make in purity,
and so thy sins confess.
Then shall thou have thy good again,
and eke thereto increace:
But Hipocrites that trust in deeds,
their glory soon shall ceace.
The ix. chapter.
Job did consent and does affirm,
that God is much of might:
And eke more just then what he made,
none like him in his sight.
And that whosoever with him does plead,
let him of this be sure:
He shall be forced to confess,
him self to be vnpure.
The x. chapter.
KNow fain he would of God the cause
why so he did him strike:
He was his woork and handy craft,
in fourm well to be likte.
Seeing (said he) I know it not,
time give me to repent:
He does describe the face of death,
that makes this life relent.
The xi. chapter.
LO (said Sophar) another friend,
what words this fellow makes:
Uniustly he did Job accuse,
that he was full of crakes.
No measure can of God be had,
he knows secrets hid:
He wills Job for to repent,
so comfort should proceed.
The xii. chapter.
MEn rich in worldly wealth despise,
both God and godliness:
Thus then (said Job) to those that came,
to mock his holiness.
The might of God he does describe,
to pass all other power:
And that no strength can him restst
if he begin to lower.
The xiii. chapter.
NOne of you all has knowledge more
(said he) then that I have:
Therefore with God now let me talk,
who shall me surely save.
He prays God to pardon him,
and to absent his ire:
So shall he then escape the wrath,
of everlasting fire.
The xiiii. chapter.
OF men's short state and misery,
and how their days be set:
Which none can pass nor cut thereof,
his time prolong nor let.
And eke how that this world shall end,
and men shall bliss then have:
So hope he proves shall never die
though men go down to grave.
The xv. chapter.
Puffed up with pride said Eliphas,
is Job right well I see:
What know thou? what can thou tell
but eke the same can we?
Th'vngodly man he runs forth
as stiff as any steel:
But God rebukes his sinful way,
which sharply he does feel.
The xvi. chapter
Quench ye your words for shame (quod Job)
what comfort call you this?
My state and case on every side,
is far from joy or bliss.
From witting sin by willing mood,
his heart and hands were clean:
Why he was stroke so grievously,
he musde what God did mean.
The xvii. chapter.
RIght rufully he shewth his case,
to God that is on hie:
And still rebukes the scornfulnes,
of those that stood him by.
But virtuous men he does commend,
for they in virtue grow:
He makes count that he shall die,
and down to dust him bow.
The xviii. Chapter.
Such torments as the wicked shall
abide for their misdeeds:
Forsooth Bildah does tell to Job,
as just deserved meeds.
Both darkness, with, and pit, and snar^
his house and fame shall die:
Such fee (says he) shall sinners have
and tells the cause and why.
The xix. chapter.
TEn times said Job ye have me vexed,
what mean ye so to do?
Ye see me spoild on every side,
and ad ye this thereto?
O favor me and hear my words,
and write them up in lead*
My savior lives whom I shall see,
when up shall rise the dead.
The xx. chapter.
WHen Job had done then Suphar spoke,
and tells the wickeds lot:
How that his gain shall home again,
which he unjustly got.
And having store yet raking more,
still saying he is poor:
He shall not escape the wrath of God
when he on him does loure.
The xxi. chapter.
AH now (said Job) hear me a while,
and answer to me give:
Why do the wicked prosper so,
and welthy long do live?
Yet is their end in wretchedness,
their God they did blaspheme:
At grave the poor shall have as much,
as he that ruled a realm.
The xxii. chapter.
BE sure of this (said Eliphas,)
God will with thee contend:
Thy cruelty to poverty,
has brought thee to this end.
Therefore convert and turn to God
and lay away thy pride:
And make thy boon in humblenes,
and God shall be thy guide.
The xxiii. chapter.
CAn God be hid? no no (said Job,)
I know his mercy great:
Before, behind, and on each side,
against him may no man pleat.
His law and eke his worthy hests,
I have and will obey:
He does his will, I do him fear,
and so shall do for ay.
The xxiiij. chapter.
DOutles I can but muse to see,
the mighty that are rich:
How knowing God, they vex the poor,
their cruelty is such.
The poor does cry, yet God permits
their tyranny to reign:
The whorishe head and wicked man
yet surely shall be slain.
The xxv. chapter.
ENding his talk Bildad began,
is their not power (said he)?
With him abooue whose men of war,
can not enumbred be.
Comparde with God, no man is just,
can women's birth be pure?
When lights abooue to him are dark,
how then shall man endure?
The xxvi. chapter.
Full strength and power has God above
said Job he needs no aid:
The hell so deep is seen to him,
the earth by him is staid.
The clouds and seas are bound by him,
the heavens by him are propt:
The Whale so huge most serpent like,
by him his power is stopped.
The xxvii. chapter.
GOd be my Judge I will not speak,
of things that shall be vain:
My righteousness I will not leave
for sin shall have his pain.
Look what the wicked does increace,
the godly shall possess:
And what he had he shall not have
thus wrath shall him so dress.
The xxviij. chapter.
HOw secret seames out silver give,
and gold with Iron hard:
How precious stones and food for folks,
and men from men be bard.
Here in the earth these things are hid
but wisdom has no peer:
Which hid from men her for to find
is only God to fear.
The xxix. chapter.
I say to you, O that I were,
as I have been tofore:
When power and might was in my hand,
and goods I had in store.
For every man gave me the place,
the poor I did defend:
And what I said, or what I did
all men did me commend.
The xxx. chapter.
Know you that now the contrary,
the vilest do me mock:
They rail, they skorn, they laugh, they (talk)
I am their jesting stock.
The Lord thereto is eke my fo,
O God do me forgive:
For I did help thaflicted man,
though now thou do me grieve.
The xxxi. chapter.
LEudly yet look I never did,
on maiden or on wife:
My household folk and strangers both
of me had never strife.
Hungry and thirsty did I feed,
the naked did I clothe:
If I have not dealt justly dole,
then let the earth me loathe.
The xxxii. Chapter.
Much musing then said Elihu,
unto his fellows three:
Have you no more to Job to say,
and you mine elders be?
Til you were dashed I being yung,
I had nothing to say:
But fearles now free speech shall pa^^e,
lest God take me away.
The xxxiii. chapter.
NOte well my words (to Job he said)
why say thou thou art Just:
Rebuke not God what so he does
for rule he has and must.
In bed full sick he does us lay,
such message us to give:
For to submit and grant our gilt,
then surely shall we live.
The xxxiiii. Chapter.
O Ye that wise and learned be,
now further see you mark
God does not strike but we deserve,
no thought to him is dark*
He has no eye to great or low,
the rich and poor are like:
Yet Job does think him self so just
that God should not him strike.
The xxxv. chapter.
PRoceeding forth Elihu said,
be thou O Job unjust:
Or be thou just as thou do say,
yet this is true to trust.
That God is ne, the more or less
made holy or defilde:
But if a man on him do call,
he shall find him full mild.
The xxxvi. Psalm.
QUietly hear me yet a while,
God does not strike for naught:
But for to tell and mend our sin,
that we tofore have wrought
Bue if they skorn then shall they die,
or if the time they track:
So great is God, him to behold,
our knowledge is to slack.
The xxxvii. Chapter.
RUling like as a Prince on hie,
our God does all things guide
The storm, the hail, the frost, ye snow,
of him they have their tide.
To punish lands or them to bless,
O Job, this is most true:
Alone he guides the things he made,
then give him glory due.
The xxxviii. Chapter.
SO then the Lord him self did speak
to Job: wast thou said he:
When I the heavens and earth did make,
of council then with me?
Can thou ought do in hie or low
of wonders that I wrought?
Have thou in waters or in land,
the treasures of them sought?
The xxxix. chapter.
THe Gotes, the Hindes, and Unicorn,
their gendring and their force:
The Pecock gay and foolish stork
or of the barbed horse.
Or of the Hauk that flies by South
or of the Egles might:
By thy device have these their gifts,
to move and take their flightes*
The xl. chapter.
WHen Job had hard what God had said
he humbly did obey:
And said he had said and would be still,
then forth the Lord did say.
The power and might of Leuiathan,
or Behemoth by name.
Can thou him rule with snare or gin,
or make him mild and tame?
The xli. chapter.
AL men may think his power is great,
though mine it not exceed:
Yet what ye make him for to hurt
he counts it as a reed
His paths are in the mighty sea,
all men from him do slide:
The mighty Whale with devil possessed
he is the King of pride.
The xlii. chapter.
BEfore the Lord Job did repent
confessing how that he:
The wondrous woorks or mighty power
of God he could not see.
His friends were wild to offer gifts
that Job might for them pray:
And God gave him of all things more
then he had ere that day.
Thus Job has done his patience,
ye have heard all his broile:
How Satan wrought to turn his faith
how friends did him turmoile.
Now sporting songs for lively wits,
such as the Lord do fear:
From David's harp the sommary.
to you shall well appear.

The Psalms of David.
The first Psalm.
A Happy hap the man shall have,
which not with sinners walks:
Ne he that in the wicked chair
of God in scorn italks.
His fruit shall be most plenteously,
rewarded eke with bliss:
When sinners shall decay and fall,
of heavenly joys to miss.
The ii. Psalm.
BEware (says he) how that ye rage,
ye rulers all in vain:
For God will have his son to rule,
in might and pour to reign.
Therefore se that ye covet lore,
and serve the Lord in fear:
Kiss him in time lest ye do smart,
when he shall once appeer.
The iii. Psalm.
CAst out of Kingdom, David cries,
to God for aid and strength:

And surely he has confidence,
that God will succor send:
That he will strike his enemies,
and eke his flock defend.
The iiii. Psalm.
DOut cast away, he trusted God,
though Saul did him molest
He checketh all the taunting men,

And proves that the care of God,
continually does feed:
Those that he loves so that they may,
take rest and sleep at need.
The v. Psalm.
Eftsoons in his adversity,
betime to God he prays:
Affirming God to be full just,
detesting sinners ways.
Beseeching God to be his guide,
describing sinners race:
Affirming that God will protect,
the just in every place.
The vi. Psalm.
Full fraught in feeling God his ire
and death to show his dart:
He humbly prays God to forgive,
and shows his mourning heart
Away (says he) ye wicked men
reeelf now have I found:
My wishers evil shall have this hap,
the Lord shall them confound.
The vii Psalm.
GIltles now David did complain,
false tales to Saul were told:
He cleeres him self and prays God,
his case for to behold.
Affirming that the glory of God,
by that should eke beseen:
And how the evil in their device,
shall wast and perish cleen.
The viii. Psalm.
HOw wunderful in all his woorks,
is God above (says he?)
Which makes babes to tell his fame
and eke the starry sky.
But yet of man he museth more,
why God should him regard:
To know the thing he does confess,
for him it is to hard.
The ix. Psalm.
I Will give praise to God (says he)
for victories by past:
Who had his foes and their defense,
both killed and over cast.
And now that foes do flow a fresh,
for wonted aid he calls:
The wicked men they were destroyed
he means that were King Saul's.
The x. Psalm.
Know here ye may the trade and way,
that wicked men do use:
Describing eke their suttleties,
the poor for to abuse.
He calls God for to aduenge,
the poor sustayning wrong:
Beseeching him to break the arm,
of the ungodly throng.
The xi. Psalm.
LO though (said he) the wicked bend,
their bow at me to shoot:
And though to hills they bid me ^lee,
and have me in pursuit.
Yet shall the Lord pour down his wrath
upon the wicked rout:
And righteous men shall have his love
of this their is no dout.
The xii. Psalm.
MEn being fallen from equity,
Gods help he does desire:
And that he would cut out the tungs,
of each flattering lier.
For needies sake the Lord will rise,
and set the bond full free:
Gods words are pure when wicked reign
it is a shame to see.
The xiii. Psalm.
NOw vexed sore with sundry sa^ts,
pressed ready to despair:
His anchor old he flees unto,
to God he makes his prayer.
And lest his foes incouragde should
be: for to see his fall:
He having aid does hight him lauds
that reigns over all.
The xiiii. Psalm.
OF foolish men that inwardly,
do say there is no God:
Describe he does their property,
and eke their fatal rod.
For mocking of the poores device,
he does also request:
The thraldom of the Israelites,
that it might turn to rest.
The xv. Psalm.
PEculiarly now does he tell,
why God did take and choose:
Of his good will into his house,
the people of the Jews.
Forsooth because that they should show,
to such as were without:
By godly life that they were Gods
to bring them out of dout.
The xvj. Psalm.
QUestionles not for his woorks
but for his faith alone:
He prays God him to preserve,
else succor has he none.
Idolatry he does detest,
true worship does he like:
Affirming that his soul shall not
be left in grauy dike.
The xvii. Psalm.
REhearse he does the cruelty,
of Saul and eke his men:
The raging pride and tyranny,
they showed unto him then.
Without deser^es, therefore he prays,
revenge of God to have:
His giltles life to Saul was such,
that makes him so to crave.
The xviii. Psalm.
Since God (says he) has stablisht me,
and set me in my throne:
For mercies great and sauegard both
to him be prays alone.
The kingdom of our Lord and Christ,
the which shall have none end:
He says, shall stand spite of the foes,
so God shall him defend.
The xjx. Psalm.
TO the intent the mighty power,
of God might well be waid:

by them he is displaid.
Besides all this his sacred word,
and law that is so pure:
He does set out as perfet guide,
to walk thereby full sure.
The xx. Psalm.
WHen that the King in warlike wise,

And that he would still on so do,
though they ne so turmoile.
The xxii. Psalm.
BRought now into extremities

When Christ should be upon the earth,
against him what should be done?
The xxiii. Psalm.
CAused by sundry succors past,
the Lord he takes for guide:
And having him for his defense,
he cares not what betide.
And seeing rest before his foes,
the Lord did to him give:
He does not dout before he goes,
full long and safe to live.
The xxiiii. Psalm.
DOutles th^n God does govern all,
yet chiefly he does choose:
Such as do live in godly life,
and wickedness refuse.
The Gentile and the Jew are like
if they obey his lore:
Their gates and doors of hearts and mind^,
must subject him before.
The xxv. Psalm.
Eftsoons as often eke before,

and to regard his case:
With mercy and with favor both,
to him to turn his face.
The xxvi. Psalm.
Full many were his enemies,
and injuries assaid:

his aulters should be pilde.
The xxvii. Psalm.
GOd is my light and sauegard both

His temple to behold and ^ee,
to dwell therein for ay:
His face to view his ways to learn,
so faith has been my stay.
The xxviii. Psalm.
HEuines now his heart besets,
to see the wicked rout:

and heard when he does call:
His heart therefore was full of joy,
and prays defense fro all.
The xxix. Psalm.
IN power such as do rule and reign,
(if God) to be they wunder:
Then he them wills to learn his might
by tempest and by thunder.
And though by them he sinners fears,
and makes them all to quake:
Yet will he save his chosen flock,
even for his mercies sake.
The xxx. Psalm.
Know did he well deliverance,

The xxxi. Psalm.
Lauds and praise yet once again,

with joys he much comfortes.
The xxxiii. Psalm.
NOw righteous men rejoice says he,
in him that us did make:

He sercheth hearts and knows thoughts
no secrets from him hid:
No help can save but his right hand
trust this, he does you bid.
The xxxiiii. Psalm.
OF fear and dread he being rid,

and sauegard for the just.
The xxxv. Psalm.
PLead thou my cause o God (says he,)
against Saul and eke his court*
Their traps they set, me for to catch,
let them turn to their hurt.
And save thou me and also those,
that gilt^es take my part:
And I shall praise thy holy name,
so long as lives my heart.
The xxxvi. Psalm.
QUite gone from fear of God are those
that follow wicked trace:
The gouernnaunce of God in earth,
does joy his woeful case.
And so much more he holds that God
his chosen shall preserve:
Who finally shall them defend,
and punish those that swerve.
The xxxvii. Psalm.
REck not (says he) nor do you fret
that wicked men do thrive:

and thou, if thou abide:
Full patiently shall have thy wish,
when that thy cause is tried.
The xxxviii. Psalm.
Sickness eftsoons does cause him say,

And firmly stands to trust to that,
and so does still remain.
The xxxix. Psalm.
TEmpted then with extremities

Beseeching him of speedy help,
that he be not bereft.
The xl. Psalm.
WHen perils past were passed by,

Still craving mercy at his hand,

With wishing those that do him fear
his prays to render all.
The xli. Psalm.
AFflicted sore yet does he bless,
those that his case lament:
Complaining much of feigned friends
that traytourously were bent.
But feeling God to be his aid,
his haters rage to stay:
He renders thanks and does protest,
he will do so for ay.
The xlii. Psalm.
BE^ing exilde from Christ's flock,
to praise his holy name:
Yet does he full protest a while,
from heart to do the same.

Yet should his soul have confidenc^
in him to take her rest.
The xliii. Psalm.

my soul shall not it loathe.
The xliiii. Psalm.
DUe thanks his people here do give,

for all their wicked checks.
The xlv. Psalm.
EXtolled is the majesty,

that none refuse will he.
The xlvi. Psalm.
FOr help received being besiegd,

does seem to be gone quite.
The xlvii. Psalm.
GGd that is of most mighty power,

that they by him be awd.
Who does also to Jacobs seed,
extend his lasting love:
He tells before the Gentiles call,
by Christ that is abooue.
The xlviii. Psalm.
HOw notably Jerusalem,
from sundry foes had aid:
How that from God their force was such
they could not be dismayed.
For which, to God they render thanks
as guide unto their dittie:
And so describe the comely state,
of their most noble City.
The xlix. Psalm.
INcline your ears (says he) and hark,
judge not that such as wealth
Have in their hands, that they be blessed

And they shall pass and perish all,

But God shall feed and save in deed,
such as in him are just.
The l. Psalm.
KNowing full well how that the church

He says, and blot out all mi gilt,
and put away my sin:
And do not strike my people for,
the fault that I fell in.
The lii. Psalm.
Much musing why that wicked man,
that Doeg had to name:

And then he wills that faithful men,
should not such tirants fear:
But stand in trust of Gods defense,
who shall their quarrels bear.
The liii. Psalm.
NO God at all the fool does say,
there is to see my fact:

But saving state with ioyfelnes,
his flock shall have in deed.
The liiii. Psalm.
O God (he says) do thou me save

of thee I do obtain.
The lv. Psalm.

upon the Lord to throw.
The lvi. Psalm.

To way his cause and him defend
so will he pay his vows:
The lvii. Psalm.
REstles again to God he calls

with music there about.

as afterward it went.
The lxiiii. Psalm.
David does pray that such as do,

his mighty woork reherce.
The lxv. Psalm.

his aulters to be dect.
The lxvii. Psalm.

he tells for mickle wonder.
The lxix. Psalm.

his foes eke so controlde.
The lxxv. Psalm.
Perpetual praise the faithful give,
to God their Judge and King:
Who righteously the world shall Judge,
at time of his coming.
Of setting up or putting down,
all power is in his hand:
His foes as dregs shall drink his wrath,
upright the just shall stand.
The lxxvi. Psalm.
QUite quailed was the Assirians po^re
Gods name thereby was known
Sennacheribs host Gods Angel slew,

Such vows therefore as they had plight
he wills they should be paid.
The lxxvii. Psalm.
REfuge in fear of Saul his foe,
he knew none but his God:
Therefore with voice to him he flies
though underneath his rod.
In half despair and woeful greef,
yet vewing Gods great might:
He cheereth up him self again,
by meruails wrought in sight.
The lxxviii. Psalm.
Such succor as the Lord had sent,
the Israelites to fore:
He tells and yet how they rebeld,
and lou'de him nere the more.

to see if they would mend:
When naught preuaild save Judah sole,
he chose none to defend.
The lxxix. Psalm.
TOrmoild the Jews with Gentiles were
to God they call for aid:

From time to time they and their ^^ock,
should there unto be pressed.
The lxxx. Psalm.
UNcessantly to God they flee,
as pastor of his sheep:
From foes to save they him besought,
which had them made to weep.

They him beseech with power from hie
the beast for to destroy.
The lxxxi. Psalm.
A Law was made for music men,
when sacrifice was made:
That they should play, he them so wills
to keep them in their trade.
And God he brings to speak to them,
and what for them he did:
What eke he wills that they should do,
but still amiss they yeed.
The lxxxii. Psalm.
Behold of this amid the rout,
of Judges God does sit:
To cause them fear, no wrong to do,
lest they do smart for it.
And though their names be nere so great,
if Justice they do miss:
As men full mean they perish shall,
let them be sure of this.
The lxxxiii. Psalm.
COmplain they did of neighbor fo^^
beseeching God of aid:
The wickeds talk they do express,
what they of them have said.
Beseeching God them to destroy,
like others them before:
^o forcing foes to know his might
and fear it evermore.
The lxxxiiii. Psalm.
David was driven by Absalon,
from Sion and his seat:

Then in the tents of wicked men,
to have a hie degree.
The lxxxv. Psalm.
EXilde they were as captive men,
but now returned from thrall
The peoples sins they are remit,

Their goodness, justice, and their peace
all this to fore he says.
The lxxxvi. Psalm.
FOr hapful hearing of the Lord,
the Prophet now does pray*
For help, for aid, for joyful sign,
he prays not to denay.
Against all such as sought his woe,
this prayer did he make:
That God is far above all Gods,
he dare well undertake.
The lxxxvii. Psalm.
GLory full great and founded sure,
to Sion does he give:
The Church of Christ in constant faith
which here on earth does live.

not Babylon in deed:
The mighty monarks of the earth,
she far does them exceed.
The lxxxviii. Psalm.
HUmblenes in affliction,

As dead in grave and darkness deep
no help that he espies.
The lxxxix. Psalm.
IN endless wise sing praise he will,
to God that is abooue:
For his great goodness and his faith
showed to him in his love.

Whose Kingdom eke and stablenes
he tells of, long befo^n.
The xC. Psalm.
Know here ye may th'eternitie,
of God all worlds before:

that they may be equal.
The xCi. Psalm.
LO, lo (says he) who so does dwell
under the Lords defense:

but safe he shall endure.
The xCii. Psalm.
Much good it is to celebrate,

But godly men in knowledge grow
and so for ay they shall.
The xCiii. Psalm.
NOne does reign but God alone,
who made the things are made:

are seen as in a shade.
His law also unto a flock,
he gave to learn him more:
And midst of them he gave him self
to fortify his lore.
The xCiiii. Psalm.
Oppressed well near with mighty foes,
for vengeance he does crave:
Beseeching, sherching, finding fault,
as though his flesh did rave.
But finding help he gives the laud,
to God his sole defense:
And full his hope he sets in him,
who shall him recompense.
The xCv. Psalm.
PEople slack he calls forth,
with double call he calls:
To laud the Lord he made these*

his voice if we neglect:
His rest we shall not see no more,
then those that were reject.
The lxxxxvi. Psalm.
QUite over all to all he cries,
to sing and laud the Lord:

to Gentiles shall he fetch.
The lxxxxvii. Psalm.
REign does the Lord, therefore the earth
let it rejoice and Isles

with lauds of cheerful mood.
The lxxxxviii. Psalm.
SIng now says he, a song anew,

to Judge after his will.
The lxxxxix. Psalm.
Triumphantly the Lord does reign,

Therefore set out his holy name,
toward hie where he does rest
The C. Psalm.
UNto the laud and praise of God
he stirs all that come:
Such as into his court approach,
he would not have them dum.
The causes why that mooues thereto
he says to be that he:
Did fourm our shape, we did not so
his goodness makes the gl^e.
The Ci. Psalm.
A That Princes and Prelates eke
would learn this Psalm by rote:
For public weal and churchely rule,
here is a godly note.
That none in Court or Kirk should be
that gave them selves to evil:
And those should be prefard alone,
as made of sin a driuel.
The Cii. Psalm.
BEholding great calamities,
with double speech he cries:
To hear his suit, to way his cause
to him above the skies.

Posterities may know thereof,
by public fame and brute.
The C.iii. Psalm.
CElebrate to God abooue,

By guyding some and feeding some
or else they all should perish.
The C.v. Psalm.
Every one for to confess,

beginning at Abram.
The C.vj. Psalm.
Full often as before so beer,

his pact he not refels.
The Cvii. Psalm
GO on he does as twice before,
to set out God as good:
Not only to the Israelites*
as in a partial mood.
But also unto all the world,
both comforter and scourge:
For which he will to God the lauds
among them all to forge.
The Cviii. Psalm.
Have here you shall the fifty seven,

so tells the holy Ghost.
The C.ix. Psalm.
IN vehement sprite he praith to God,
to aduenge him on his foes:

By flattering talk in foul wise,
to please the ears of Saul:
They told to him a thousand lies
so heaping David's thrall.
The C.x. Psalm.
KIng David here of Christ does tell,
as Christ him self does say:

all subject to his beck.
The C.xj. Psalm.
LOok what the Lord had promised
to Israel long ago:

to have the same in awe.
The C.xii. Psalm.
Much good he says shall light to him,
that has the Lord in fear:

Although the wicked chafe thereat,
when they the same shall see.
The C.xiii. Psalm.
Naught else he wills but laud and praise
to God above to give:
Which looks down from hie above,
on things that here do live.
And does from dust set up the poor,
with princes for to sit:
And makes the barren fruit to have
and to rejoice in it.
The C.xiiii. Psalm.
OF Gods behavior toward his flock
when Egypt they went out:
How mountains, hills, and waters low
from order turned about
All fearing much the face of God
he says this came to pass:
And stony rock to water flud,
by him so turned was.
The C.xv. Psalm.
PUtting all glory quite away,
from Idolles feigned Gods:

his name be blessed always.
The C.xvi. Psalm.
QUe^che they could not but he ^ would

The vows that he to God did vow,
when he was driven away.
The C.xvii. Psalm.
RIght as before so here again,

To laud the Lord that as he reignd,
so evermore he shall.

From time to time withouten end,
as he it once begun.
The C.xviii. Psalm.
SO God alone he does confess,
because that he is good:
The Israelites he wills thereto,
as he that sau'de their blood.
From Philistines and other foes,
that did against them bark:
And gave them rest to laud the Lord,
and to set up his Ark.
The C*xix. Psalm.
THough it be long yet in a some,
this Psalm does say thus much:
That study of the law of God,
there is no study such.
Sometimes he speaks eke of his foes,
and some also he threats:
These three are cheef in matters all,
that in this songs he treates.
The C.xx. Psalm.
UNto such tungs as use to lie,
and eke for to backbight:

Kept him exilde and yet thereto,
they wrought him mickle hurt.
The C.xxi. Psalm.
AT God alone all aid is had,

No hurt can come unto his Church,
for he does still it keep.
The C.xxii. Psalm.

and round about the bars.
The C.xxiii. Psalm.
CAused were some this psalm to make
which for their godliness:
Were mocked and scornd, and taunted eke,
of men in wickedness.
They wait as maids upon their dames,
and tend upon the Lord:
Beseeching mercy at his hand,
though others at them board.
The C.xxiiii. Psalm.
DOuble (he says) unless that God,
had been on Isreal's side:
Most certainly by foreign foes,
it had with them been wide.
For quick they had devoured them,
as flud they had ore run:
They bless the Lord that made al thing
from whom all help does come.
The C.xxv. Psalm.
Each one that in the Lord does trust,
shall be as Sion mount:

he may thereof account.

shall not be mixed in one:
And such as turn unto their evils,
they shall be woe be gone.
The C.xxvi. Psalm.
Full joyful shall the captives be,
when home they do return:

with songs they shall home come.
The C.xxvii. Psalm.
GOne unto naught is all the woork

God, fruteful shall thee make.
The C.xxviii. Psalm.
HOw happy he shall be he telth,
that always God does fear

and Isreal's peace yken.
The C.xxix. Psalm.
IN cheerful wise may Israel
say, often times they have
Me fought against: even from my youth,
but God he did me save.
Confounded shall the plowers be,
that plowd upon my back:
And all that Sion once did hate,
their power shall be but slack.
The C.xxx. Psalm.
KIng David as some men suppose,
being sore vexed of Saul:
Out of the depth unto the Lord,
he did both cry and call.
Beseeching him for to forgive,
his sins and set him free:
The Israelites some thing yet made,
in their captivity.
The C.xxxi. Psalm.
LIfted aloft his heart is not,
ne yet his eyes with pride:
Nor yet in things passing his reach,
he has not walked aside.
But has his soul as nurced child,
kept still in perfet awe:
And wills them to wait for him
the author of their law.
The C.xxxii. Psalm.
MEn may suppose this Psalm to be,
made of King Solomon:

for God therein to shade:
And how that priests and people eke,
should joy to see it made.
The C.xxxiii. Psalm.
NOte and behold how good it is,

So God shall make his blessing fall,
on seekers of his peace.
The C.xxxiiii. Psalm.
O All ye servants of the Lord,
sing praises to his name:

So shall the Lord us bless again,
who made both night and days.
The C.xxxv. Psalm.
PErfourm ye lauds unto the Lord,

He passes all the Gentiles Gods,
the God I mean of Jews.
Who out of Egypt led his flock,
and gave them Canaan:
The dummy Gods are painted out,
and God is blessed than.
The C.xxxvi. Psalm.
Quench not your zeal but still confess,
that God is God for ay:
And that his mercy does endure,
for ever and a day.
For all his woorks that he has made
we have good cause thereto:
And for his private benefits,
that he has showed to you.
The C.xxxvii. Psalm.
RIght rufully a song they sung,
sitting in Babylon:
Expressing eke the tauntes of them,
that looked them upon*
Beseeching God them to reward,

And blesses them that Babylon,
shall hap for to destroy.
The C.xxxviii. Psalm.
Such goodness as he found of God,
in troubles and in need:

they shall not make him dum:
In midst of foes for help he hopes,
yea, in the time to come.
The C.xxxix. Psalm.
TO God there is nothing unknown
both thoughts, and words, and deeds:

For wicked men he praith the end,
and him to guide aright.
The C.xl. Psalm.
UNlose me Lord to God (he says,)
from wicked men's device:
Who with their ^ungs do me belie,
and seek my life to trise.
But God his God he does so make,
that little does he care:
And knows that God to help the just
it is not to him rare.
The C.xli. Psalm.
AS he among the wicked dwelt
within the Courts of Saul:
He prays God that he do not,
such sin as they in fall.
And that he would preserve him eke,
and save him from their ginnes
And if he light within their snares,
that he may break their grinnes.
The C.xlii. Psalm.
BEing close hid with in a cave,
for fear of Saul his foe:
He praith to God in his distress,
to save and help him so.
That out of darkness as a nail,
he would his soul out take:
And so his prayers being heard,
the just his part should take.
The C.xliii. Psalm.
CAll unto God again he does,
as one oppressed with foes:
As one whose soul and spirit also,
was set with many woes.
To hear him and deliver him,
and eke to teach his way:
And him to save for his names sake,
thus does his servant pray.
The C.xliiii. Psalm.
David here does now mix his Psalm,
with thanks for foes oppressed:
Affirming man and all his days
to be but vain and pressed.
To pass away as does a shade,
then does he God entreat:
His other foes for to suppress,
and make his quiet seat.
The C.l^v. Psalm.
Even as before full often times
so here he does declare:
The maruels of the mighty God,
how wonderful they are.
His goodness and his clemency,
his mercy and his might:
How things that wait on him for food,
he feeds them full right.
The C.xlvi. Psalm.
Full plesantly this himne and three
that do the same sucseed:
Does set out praises to the Lord,
with mouth and mind in deed.
Forbidding confidence to put,
in any princes might:
But trust the maker of the heavens,
that gives the blind his sight.
The Cxlvii: Psalm.
GO forth he does and wills laud^,
Jerusalem to make:
Which mightily did woork for it
and still her part did take.
Still filling her with benefits,
and Sion eke thereto:
The like to others did he not,
as he did them unto.
The C.xlviii. Psalm.
Here does he will the Angels hie,
and all the powers above:
With fire, depth, and Dragons great,
and all things that does move.
Both heat and cold, both yung and old
the people and their King:
The mountains, trees, and creeping beasts
all lauds to him to sing.
The Cxlix. Psalm.
IN this his Psalm he does exhort,
the Israelites to praise:
Their God and King with instruments,
his people do him please.
He telth also that they shall joy,
in victory to come:
On Gentiles and their Kings thereto,
such joy shall light on some.
The C.l. Psalm.
KNit up he does his psalms with this
that such as music use:
Their instruments to laud the Lord,
they should them therefore choose.
Exhorting all that breaths breath,
to laud and do the same:
And so with this he makes an end,
praise ye his holy name.
FINIS.
Thus ended are the Psalms in course,
an hundredth forty ten:
In songs as they divided are,
I mean the sum of them.
And if in place some word or line,
or verse be out of frame:
Yet bear with me, Judge my good will,
and gladly mend the ^ame.
And friend or foe that shall me tell,
by any manner wise:
Where I have mist miscanning right,
not using meeter guise.
I shall right gladly give mine ear,
to harken to his talk:
And with my pen I will be sure,
his council not to balke.
Now perfet Proverbs follow next,
of Solomon the King:
Who so his rules they do observe*
good life they shall him bring.
The sum and pith of all the law*
of God the Lord is here:
And perfet manners who so list,
to learn let him come near.
And listen well and give his mind,
to print them in his heart:
With life thereto whiles he does live
so shall he well depart.

FINIS.
The Proverbs of Solomon.
The j. chapter.
A Man that wisdom will attain,
to do all things aright:
To fear the Lord he must begin,
though fools not so delight.
Cast not thy lot in sinners life,
their tising words refuse:
Wisdom she cries in open streets
but few her lore will use.
The ii. chapter.
BEnd thy self unto wisedoms will,
as she does thee persuade:
And she will teach thee perfet skill,
to walk a godly trade.
From God she comes he does her give,
who does preserve the just:
And wisdom had within thy heart,
in goodness shall thou lust.
The iii. chapter.
COnsider well the law of God,
and bind thee to the same:
Thy trust, thy fear, and honor both,
let them be in his name.
If he correct, do thou obey,
seek wisdom and have ease:
Do thou no wrong ne seek thou strife
for such do God displease.
The iiii. chapter.
DEcline thou not from wisedoms rule
she shall thee woorship bring
But in the way that wicked walk,
use not for any thing.
The righteous way still more does shine,
the wicked walk in dark:
His words and rules to wholesome life,
he would that we should mark.
The v. chapter.
Even as experience had him taught,
the end of whorishe life:
He telth and shows what evil shall fall,
on him that leaves his wife.
Exhorting man to rest him self,
with her that is his own:
And not to give his strength and good,
to them that are unknown.
The vj. chapter.
FOr suretiship a lesson good,
for sluggards eke the same*
Six things are hated of the Lord
the seventh abhorres by name.
He wilth us listen to the lore,
that God in Church does tell:
So shall we escape the wanton loo^
of whores that leads to hell.
The vii. chapter.
GOod council given he wilth to take,
and eke thereto to cleave:
By which we shall attain to know,
how harlots ways to leave.
Apelles never so could paint,
a whore in coullours brave:
As he describes her trayning tricks,
which leads unto grave.
The viii. Chapter.
HE does describe how wisdom cries,
and utters her voice:
How excellent her riches is,
so gainful is her choice.
She passes Gold and Silver eke,
before all things she was:
In making things she was with God
by her came all to pass.
The ix. chapter.
IN comely wise has wisdom built,
an house and made a feast:
And called folks unto her fare,
but scorners at her gest.
The fear of God of wisdom is,
the first beginning race:
The foolish woman shows her self,
in every common place.
The x. chapter.
KIng Solomon his parables,
five hundredth sixty ten:
In twenty chapters does appeer,
full feat to teach all men.
Which so do shift and matters change,
almost in every line:
That in these staves to set them out,
no man can do in rhyme.
The xxx. chapter.
LO humble men se that you learn,
what Agur here does say:
That God his word you hold thereto
and ad ne take away.
He praith to God that rich nor poor^,
but meanly he may live:
He tells of things are never full,
and wunderous things that meue.
The ^i. Chapter.
MEn may here learn of chastity,
and Justice eke the way:
For whom that wine and drink full strong
is meet and in what day.
And for that wife that list to live,
uprightly in this vale:
Let her here read of Lamuel
to him his mothers tale.
FINIS.
Thus Solomon has told his tale,
full wisely in his book:
And if you muse why I so short,
in hand his Proverbs took.
You shall perceive that after that,
ten Chapters ye have red:
He does so change in Adagies,
and sentences so shed.
That every line unto him self,
a perfet staff would have:
So should I not in eight contain,
a Chapter so to save.
Then understand that after nine,
to thirty I do leap:
Who list to have of sayings sage,
twixt both he may them reap.
So then before, though that you see,
eleven the figure set:
Yet the thirty Chapter after,
in it these things ye get.
And then the last is thirty one.
though twelve the figure bear:
So of the Proverbs last of all,
the Chapters ends there.
Now shall you have him preach to you,
a sermon full of lore:
Who so it reads and marks it well,
shall make but little store
Of goods or lands, of fame or name
of knowledge or of might:
Of plesures, plants, and buildings eke,
he shall have small delight.

The book of the Preacher.
The i. Chapter.
ALl things is full of vanity,
the precher here does tell:
There is nothing is durable,
so long as we here dwell.
And though a man be nere so wise
yet folly eke and greef:
To reign in him he may confess,
as part of his belief.
The ii. Chapter.
BEgin he did to take delight,
in pleasures and in game:
His eye ne likte, but he it got,
full vain he found the same.
As well the wise to grave shall go,
as shall the idiot fool:
Wherefore to eat and cheerful be,
he puth us to that scoole.
The iii. Chapter.
Confess he does that all thing has,
a time to go and coome:
That all things was the which is now,
and shall be in the room.
The woorks of God most perfet are
and cause us him to fear:
Both good and bad the Lord shall Judge
when that he shall appeer.
iiii. Chapter.
DOutles the cause of Innocents
not heard did vex him much:
Our labor here is full of greef,
the vanity is such.
Society and feloweship,
is better then alone:
A yung man poor if he be wise,
excels a fool in throne.
The v. Chapter.
ELect and choose thy words aright,
when thou to God do speak:
The laboring man does sleep full sound,
when Dives brains does break.
Man when he dies shall nothing have
but that which he did bring:
To eat and drink and joyful be,
it passes here all thing.
The vi. Chapter.
Full foolish is the rich man sure,
whom God much good has sent:
And yet t'enioy the things he has,
the heart is not him lent.
But he that has not swet therefore,
shall eat it up at will:
Yet way they not their greedy lust,
and all the mouth to fill.
The vii. Chapter.
GOod wholesome rules here are you given
from mourning for to flee:
Flee hasty speech and angry mood
let wisdom guide thine eye.
So shall she make thee strong in deed,
much folly to prevent:
Man was made good, now is he bad,
by things he did invent.
The viii. Chapter.
HOw that we must obey the King
and rulers that do reign:
And yet how none is Lord of death.
his life for to retain.
This chapter telth and furthermore,
how Gods woorks are unknown:
Though God prolong to punish sin
yet fear thou him alone.
The ix. Chapter.
IN looking upon outward things,
that God does give to man:
To judge whom he does love or hate,
that justly no man can.
Nor tell the time when he shall die,
therefore for wisdom seek:
If thou be poor though thou be wise,
yet none will to thee seek.
The x. Chapter.
Know well ye may the difference
twixt wisdom and a fool:
The babbling tung that slander does,
ye shall not easily cool.
He telth of Kings that folly have,
and will be ouerseen:
That land is blessed whose head is wise,
be it a King or Queen.
The xi. Chapter.
LIke, liberal men he does exhort,
to poor that they should be:
And not to dout Gods providence,
what so that we do see.
That prosperous state here in this life,
is vanity and shall:
As long as world does stand with men
but God shall judge us all.
The xii. Chapter.
MEn that run on til youth be past,
and never do repent:
In age shall short come of their will,
when vain their time is spent.
This is the end fear God and keep,
all his commandments:
For God will bring forth every woork,
and give them their Judgments.
FINIS.
The Preacher thus his sermon ends,
both short and sweet to hear:
The pleasant song of Solomon,
shall now to you appeer.
By parables how Christ does love,
his Church he does you show:
And eke again how she him loves,
here may you read and know.

The Canticles of Solomon.
The i. Chapter.
A Fre^dly talk the Church does use
to Christ her love so deer:
And he again so sets her out,
as now to be her peer.
Though foes do fume to see their love,
and faults in her there be:
Yet by his favor and his grace,
they both do well agree.
The ii. Chapter.
BEautifully as Lilly fair,
her song forth on she sings
And shade she took to rest her self,
even underneath his wings.
She hears his voice as dooue full mild,
and does thereto incline:
The Fory foes they are forbod,
from hurting of the vine.
The iii. Chapter.
CAst care she did her love to find,
and sought in every ground:
She ceased not to seek and ask
until she had him found.
How she did pass from wilderness,
with smoky pillars smelt:
How Prince like eke King Solomon,
within his Pallaice dwelt.
The iiii. Chapter.
DOutles full fair thou art my love
and blemishe have thou none:
Thy teeth, thy lips, thy neck and breasts
are comely every one.
My sister deer he does her call,
and love on her he shows:
Commanding winds to do her good
though contrary it blows.
The v. Chapter.
Each thing that Christ has of his own
unto his Church he gives:
For to perfourm his tresures great
to her, it not him greeues.
His voice she hears and does confess
her self to be but bare:
How beautiful her husband is,
she does at large declare.
The vi. Chapter.
Full sure she is of Christ's love,
and he of hers full sure:
Whose comely state is painted out
to be full fair and pure.
She is but one and vndefilde,
by Christ who made her clean:
Where purity of her is spoke,
none other does it mean.
The vii. Chapter.
GO on she does in comely wise
full seemly to behold:
Of all her parts so beautiful,
here unto you is told.
From top to toe she is describde,
of Christ the only spouse:
Who like a palm does grow full trim,
with Christ upon her bows.
The viii. Chapter.
HIm does she choose her for to teach,
by him she is uphold:
The love that he to her does bear,
with tung can not be told.
She is again that pleasant vine,
that forth her fruit does bring:
For Christ her love forefigured,
by Solomon the King.
FINIS.
This song full hard to understand,
does end with Chapters eight.
With judgment great it woold be red,
it is of mickle weight.
Though fools do laugh and toy thereat,
yet be you sure of this:
The ioyfull'st song in Bible book,
assuredly it is.
Now shall ye hear what Esaias says,
he told of Christ to fore:
Full Gospel like he telth his tale,
now harken to his lore.

Esaias the Prophet
The i. Chapter.
ALl creatures he does will to bear,
record what he shall say:
How god had been unto the Jews
full merciful always.
But seeing God they did not fear,
he threatens them full sore:
That God would ease him on his greef
yet saving some in store.
The ii. Chapter.
BEfore he telth by Prophecy,
how that the Gentiles all:
Should be converted to the Lord,
and woorship him they shall.
Laying aside all variance,
and strife against the Lord:
But Israel should plagued be,
because he was untoward.
The iii. Chapter.
CAst out he would the heads and cheef,
of all among the Jews:
And send them children for to rule,
he tells them this news.
And all because their pride was such,
their rulers went astray:
Their women eke should baldnes have,
whose tussocks had been gay.
The iiii. Chapter.
DEstruction shall so light on them
their men shall so decay:
That women seven shall take one man,
to be to them a stay.
But after this the Lord shall turn
his heavy wrathful hand:
And cause the remnant of the Just,
in peace to have the land.
The v. Chapter.
Esaias does now begin to sing,
a song for to describe:
The Church how like a vine it is,
well fenst on every side.
But no good grape yet did it bear,
but branches forth it brought:
So curses he their greedines,
excess and things they wrought.
The vi. Chapter.
Full power he has to Prophecy
God sitting in his throne:
Does send him forth to tell the flock,
their sins him self alone.
Their ears they stopped they would not hear
their hearts they were so hard:
They had no awe unto his words,
they did him not regard.
The vii. Chapter.
GO tell the King, God said to him
the enemies shall not harm:
That Judah have conspired to hurt,
regard not thou the swarm.
A s^gne was given a virgin should,
conceive and bear a child:
So long before of Christ he told,
whose coming should be mild.
The viii. Chapter.
HOw Israel and Judah both,
as captives should be led:
The Assirians power he telth before,
who should of them be head.
And how that Christ most holy then
should be a stumbling stone:
Exhort he does to godliness
the faithful every one.
The ix. Chapter.
IN darkness though the Gentiles sa^,
yet unto light they shall:
Be called by Christ who is the God,
that rules over all.
To the ten tribes he telth before,
that they should be cast out:
Because they did contemn the Lord,
and were so proud and stout.
The x. Chapter.
Know woe and pain they shall that do^
make laws the poor to noy:
The Assirian prince should plague his church
and God would him destroy.
And yet to comfort his elect,
a remnant he does say:
For all the spoil should yet be sa^'de,
and kept until a day.
The xi. Chapter.
LIneally how Christ should come,
of Iesses stock he telth:
And of his virtues and his power
which far alone excelth.
The mighty power shall be full mild
at time when he shall reign:
His friends shall floorish his foes shall fear
their brags shall be but vain.
The xii. Chapter.
Much laud and praise shall then be made
and sing they shall with cheer:
Though God was angry with his flock,
yet mercies now appeer.
And saying we salvation may,
now hope to draw from him:
His name we will set out and praise
let Sion sing this himn*
The xiii. Chapter.
NOw does he tell how God should call,
the Medis in their might:
The Persians eke for to appeer
his battle for to fight.
For to destroy the Babel power,
and bring their pride full low:
And all their fame and progeny,
out right to overthrow.
The xiiii. Chapter.
ONe cause he telth why Babylon,
should so destroyed be:
Because the Jews there captives were
but so should be set free.
And how he should derided be,
and come unto his end:
The Philistines for all his death,
no joy should apprehend.
The xv. Chapter.
PErfourm would God yet further more
and Moab would he smite:
Their cheifest towns should taken be,
and spoild from them by might.
Their river great should stained be,
with blood of their own stock,
Their ruin should on them so light,
for hurting of his flock.
The xvj. chapter.
QUit him now God does full intend,
of Moab for his pride:
Because his Church they would not help
when hurtes did them betide.
Their pride therefore shall have a fall,
he tells to them plain:
In three years space the multitude
should taken be or slain.
The xvii. chapter.
REwarded should Damascus be
the Sirians he does mean:
And Ephraim that did decline,
should neee be wasted clean.
By scourges great they should repent,
their straying so from God:
A foreign power shall them invade,
but sudenly forbod.
The xviii Chapter.
Such ships as sailed on the sea,
by Ethiopia might:
He wilth to flee with wings of sails,
to tell the world the plight.
That Israel was brought unto,
for breaking of their law:
How Gentiles should be called to grace,
and stand of God in awe.
The xix. Chapter.
THe burden of the heavy plague,
that Egypt should sustain:
By Assirian power because they put,
their trust in Idols vain.
Yet shall the Lord give them his law
and Assure eke the same:
And Israel in midst of them,
these three shall praise his name*
The xx. Chapter.
WHen words would not make them believe
what Esaias then said:
A sign he gave by nakedness,
that so they should be paid.
For three years space the Assirians should
the Ethiopians broile:
And Egypt land likewise subdue.
not sparing both to spoil.
The xxj. chapter.
AGain he telth how Babylon,
should quite be overthrown*
Babel is fallen, Babel is fallen,
so should the noyes be blown.
Idumea and Arabie,
the like should them befall:
The Medes and eke Persians,
should bring them in to thrall.
The xxii. chapter.
BEcause Jerusalem did trust,
in walls and diches deep:
Therefore the Prophet telth their fall,
which causes him to weep.
And how that Sobna had him made,
a Sepulture in vain:
For why as captive he should die,
with tossed life in pain.
The xxiii. Chapter.
CAst down he says that God would do,
the pride of Tirus town:
The merchants that had world at will,
should be of small renown.
And yet when years are past and gone,
that for her plague are sent:
She should again to former stat^,
be set and so repent.
The xxiiii. chapter.
DEclare he does that God will curse,
and strike the earth for sin:
Both head and foot none should escape,
when that he does begin.
And yet not so but that a few,
should well escape the same:
Unto the end that they might show
the praises of his name.
The xxv. Chapter.
EXalt he does the Lord above,
and praise him evermore:
For punishing the wicked so,
which set not by his ^ore.
And for the sparing of his flock,
and forcing foes to vade:
By similitude unto his saints,
a feast to them he made.
The xxvi. Chapter.
FAithful men here sing to their God,
and do therein confess:
Their saving health to come from him,
and eke also their peace.
And how the dead in perfet shape,
shall rise out of the dust:
And how the Lord shall visit them,
that in him had no trust.
The xxvii. Chapter.
GOd will destroy Leuiathan,
the Devil and all his might:
And will defend his vine the Church,
and purge her in his sight.
Then shall she render to the Lord,
his lauds with willing will:
When from their foes they be returned,
unto his holy hill.
The xxviii. Chapter.
HOw God would plague the Israelites,
who wine so fast did drink:
That drunkenness they wayed more,
then on his law to think.
The stumbling stone that he would lay,
and woork his will when he:
Should see his time and point his place,
how every thing should be.
The xxix. Chapter.
Jerusalem shall punished be,
their sacrifice shall ceace:
Their altar shall oreturned be,
their foes on them shall preace.
With lips alone and dreams of men,
because they did him serve:
He would them strike and yet of love,
some seed he would preserve.
The xxx. chapter.
KNowing that they at Egypt sought,
for help in their distress:
And that they did the Prophets mock,
which sought them to redress.
Therefore he telth destruction,
to light upon the swarm:
But yet all such as do repent,
he says shall take no harm.
The xxxi. Chapter.
LIkewise the Lord does curse all the^,
that do his help forsake:
And put their trust in man or horse,
fore him that did them make.
And yet still favor he does, faith,
to them that will amend:
And cast their Idols quite away,
on whom they did depend.
The xxxii. Chapter.
Much good does come when rulers good
have place to sit and Judge:
The nature of a churl is such,
against the poor to grudge.
That careless women shall lament,
the ruin shall be such:
But when that Christ shall come to reign
their comfort shall be much.
The xxxiii. Chapter.
NO gain at all shall they obtain,
that do the Church molest:
When they have spoild and done their will,
God will their deeds detest.
And give unto his flock a pause,
while he does strike their foes:
That better they may keep his laws,
that all their doings knows.
The xxxiiii. chapter.
OF very love that God does bear,
to his elected sort:
He will imbrue his sword in blood,
to bate the wicked port.
And so destroy the cursed train,
their City so deface:
That Oule and Raven with Ziim and Lim,
shall there have dwelling place.
The xxxv. chapter.
PErfet good joy, belief in Christ,
to such that here do dwell:
Does bring to them their office told
that preach to men Gospel.
And eke the fruit of those that hear,
the preching of it right:
To Sion shall they turn again,
and that in joyful plight.
The xxxvi. Chapter.
QUestionles the pride was great,
of Rabsaketh the Prince:
He thought by threats to make ye Jews,
not able for to quinche.
Blaspheming God with spiteful taunts
and bragging in the might:
Of his great King Senacherib,
he spoke his speech in spite.
The xxxvii. Chapter.
REnting his clothes, Ezechiah
axt council of Esaias:
Who told him plain he need not fear,
the Lord his foes would pay.
Senacherib blasphemde again,
then Ezechiah praid:
An Angel did his foes destroy,
so fell it as was said.
The xxxviiii. Chapter.
SO sick then fell Ezechiah,
God did him health restore:
And caused him prolong his years,
for fifteen had he more.
Then gave he thanks unto the Lord,
when sign of health he saw:
And leaves of Figs unto his pain,
were laid his sore to draw.
The xxxix. chapter.
THen was the King reproved much,
Ezechiah by name:
For showing of his treasures great,
to men that were of fame.
And that was to Ambassadors,
that came from Babylon:
Therefore the Prophet Esaias says
thou shall be woe begone.
The xl. Chapter.
Which way our sins remitted be,
by Christ he telth before:
And of John Baptist he does show,
and what shall be his lore.
Rebuking eke Idolaters,
describing them full plain:
And eke all those which God forsook,
and man does trust full vain.
The xli. Chapter.
ALone does God his people choose
and that of mercy mere:
They being those among them selves
each one does other cheer.
With comfort he does comfort them
their Idolles are but vain:
No things to come can tell but God
ne make that douts be plain.
The xlii. Chapter.
Behold he wilth that ready pressed
is Christ for to obey:
In humblenes by suffering wise,
for our offense to pay.
The deaf, the blind, and prisoners,
with such like to relieve:
The Gentiles all shall called be,
unto the right believe.
The xliii. Chapter.
CAst care aside and have good hope,
let naught make you afraid*
Thou Jacobs house, for I thy God,
will surely be thine aid:
Alone I will thy foes confound,
and eke also remit:
Thy sin my self of my good will,
and think no more of it.
The xliiii. Chapter.
Do dout away, be of good cheer,
yet once again my flock:
I am the same that always has,
born love unto your stock.
The Image and the woorkmaster,
are vain and perish shall:
Though they be false he will perfourm,
his servants sayings all.
The xlv. Chapter.
ERect a King he would, that should,
set free his Church at large:
Cirus by name was he that should
receive of God the charge.
There is none just but God alone
that rules over all:
Who will so woork that every knee,
shall down before him fall.
The xlvi. Chapter.
Fallen flat to ground is Babylon,
their Idols eke of gold:
Are beaten down which in the streets*
their shoulders up did hold.
The Jews he calth that they should mark
his works of wu^ders wrought:
His Justice and his mercy both,
should soon to them be brought.
The xlvii. Chapter.
GOd now does tell why Babel great,
should once be set a side:
Because that she no mercy showed,
when Judah she did guide.
And for their pride and bragging boste,
and eke her foolish trust:
That in enchaunting she did put,
now feel her fall she must.
The xlviii. Chapter.
HE telth of their Hypocrisy,
and does the same reprove:
Deferring yet them to reward,
so moved by his love.
Exhorting them to worship him,
for that to him is due:
So would he out of Babylon*
deliver all their crew.
The xlix. Chapter.
I Do exhort ye nations all,
that ye believe and hold:
The promises which God has plight
and often to you told.
For saving health unto you all,
if you the same believe:
By Christ and eke deliverance,
from foes ye shall atcheeue.
The l. Chapter.
Known unto God was well the cause
why he the Jews forsook:
The cause was their Iniquity,
the which in hand they took.
Yet should they know the power of God
not minisht long to be:
Christ shall obey and upper hand,
of foes attain shall he.
The li. Chapter.
LOok well upon the faith that once,
in Abraham was found:
For I am he, thus says the Lord,
that shall thy foes confound.
Though scourged be Jerusalem,
yet shall their woeful cross:
Be profitable unto them,
thereby to have no loss.
The lii. Chapter.
MAke merry ye my people all,
captivity is past:
And joyful freedom ye shall have,
given unto you at last.
His messengers he will send out,
their beauty shall excel:
But one of all above the rest,
shall bear away the bell.
The liii. Chapter.
NOt one almost that should believe,
in Christ because that he:
So simple should appeer to men,
and in such poverty.
And yet him self should bear away,
our sins upon the cross:
And eke the pain unto them due,
so paying all our loss.
The liiii. Chapter.
OF Gentiles mo the Gospel shall,
embrace, then of the Jews:
And fruit shall bring accordingly,
as hearers of such news.
So God his people will forsake,
and stand aside a while:
But yet at length he will return,
and freendly on them smile.
The lv. Chapter.
PRoclaim he does, who so is dry,
come drink withouten cost:
And pay no more to stay your thirst,
your labor is but lost.
Draw near to God while he is nie,
and do away your sin:
His word shall not out from him pass,
but somewhat it shall win.
The lvi. chapter.
QUe^che not the right, let Justice pass
to Judges he does speak:
And says for all, his house shall be,
therein their plaintes to break.
The watch men blind as Dogs are dum
they wake but for their gain:
From day to day to fill in wine,
there in is all their pain.
The lvii. Chapter.
RIghteous God takes hence,
lest they of plagues should taste:
Which he preparde to punish sin
upon the earth to cast.
Idolatrers they be rebukte,
for serving Idols vain:
No peace can be to wicked men,
but war and endless pain.
The lviii. Chapter.
SPare not but cry should ministers,
as watch men should they blow:
And tell the people their offense,
not sparing hie or low.
How Hipocrites look all for meed,
in fasting of their fast:
Of violence and doing wrong,
such food we should not taste.
The lix. Chapter.
THe wicked by his wickedness,
doothe perish and decay:
But godly men their sin confess,
and so are done away.
For God him self his Church will save,
when strength of man does fail:
His word adjoined to his spirit,
shall over all prevail.
The Lx. Chapter.
UNto the knowledge of the truth,
the Gentiles shall be brought:
And heaps of them should come to god,
as one that has them bought.
And Sion that forsaken was,
and often had il luck:
Should be refresht with paps of Queens,
for on them should she suck.
The Lxi. Chapter.
ANointed Christ is sent to preach
the wretched to relieve:
And saving health to give to them,
which on him do believe.
For which the faithful do rejoice,
and lauds unto him bring:
He shall cause virtue in his Church,
abundantly to spring.
The Lxii. Chapter.
BEhold the day right fain they would
wherein that they might see:
The Christ that should by promise told
set them at large and free.
Good pastors cease not for to preach,
and teach the way aright:
How people shall escape the rod,
that else on them should light.
The lxiii. Chapter.
COme forth and do his feat alone
shall God, his Church to save:
And in his wrath tread down the foes,
that against his flock did rave.
Great benefits of his mere love,
to his still show he does:
Though Abram do not know our state
yet God it kens forsooth.
The lxiiii. Chapter.
DIrect he does to God his speech,
his prayers does begin:
Entreating not that he would think,
upon the peoples sin.
But rather that of him they might,
some succor feel and taste:
In waying how their church was burnt,
and City lay full wast.
The lxv. Chapter.
Eftsoons he telth how Gentiles shall
him seek and eke embrace:
And how that Jews for scorning him
should be set in their place
Much joy the chosen should atcheeue,
where as contrary wise:
Great punishment shall on them light,
that do his name despise.
The Lxvi. Chapter.
Full hie abooue God has his seat,
and eke in heart of man:
And not in temple made by men,
and sacrifices than.
He does mislike when mercy wantes:
oppressed he releeues:
The wicked with eternal pain,
by Justice still he greeues.
FINIS.
Thus have you heard this Prophet speak,
of Christ his kingdom much:
Rebuking sin with threats full sore,
against both poor and rich.
And how the Jews should feel the stroke
of Gods full mighty hand:
By spoils and waste that foreign foes
should make within their land.
And yet not quite forsaken should,
they be, when they did yield:
But be restorde and turn again,
their City for to build.
And that their foes which once did flow,
and floorishe in their fume:
At length should stoup and to them bow,
and should no more presume.
To do them harm, and some of them
should quite their Kingdoms leese:
And heaps of Gentiles God should serve,
full humbly on their knees.
For magistrates that Judge not just,
and Prelates in their pride:
And people stout with necks full stiff,
he telth what shall betide.
Now Jeremy shall show him self,
what God by him did speak:
Who very yung was sent of God,
his mind to Jews to break.
And forty years he prophesied,
five Kings were come and gone,
At home he taught and eke abroad
to them at Babylon.

The Prophecy of Jeremy.
The i. Chapter.
AT what time he did prophecy,
and also how that he:
Did think him self not to be meet,
to be as he should be.
But God does him encourage forth*
and bids him to be bold:
So then of their captivity,
by Jeremy is told.
The ii. Chapter.
BEfore their eyes he does set out
what God for them had wrought:
How they again and eke their preests,
did set the Lord at naught.
Therefore their sin shall them destroy,
so that they shall not say:
That God is cause or has delight,
that they should so decay.
The iii. Chapter.
CRy out he does and calth on them,
their sins for to repent:
So should their Church be heald again,
God would from wrath relent.
Of Judah and of Israel,
comparison he does make:
Which for their whoring Idol wise,
deuorcement he would make.
The iiii. Chapter.
DOutles if truly they repent,
God would them not subvert:
The Circumcision outwardly,
not like to that in heart.
How Judah should destroyed be,
for their ungodliness:
For which the Prophet does lament,
in seeing their distress.
The v. Chapter.
Every sort were fallen away,
from subject unto head:
Both swearing false, and whorishe life
as neyghing horse they led.
Therefore should Judah be destroyed,
the Caldeys should them wast:
So should they for their sinful life,
such sorrows feel and taste.
The vi. Chapter.
FRom far their foes should come and flock,
their City to bese^*
Their sin was cause they cared not
when preachers did them threat.
The Caldeys should this revel make,
not sparing yung nor old:
He wills them to mourn, but they
regard not what is told.
The vii. Chapter.
GOd does rebuke the confidence,
in temple that they had:
For there they thought to make amends
though life were nere so bad.
Much evil should surely light on them,
for Prophets they despise:
Obedience God better likes,
then any sacrifice.
The viii. Chapter.
HE telth what revel foreign power
should make among the Jews:
And how if that they did repent,
they should have better news.
The Prophets false he does rebuke,
for uttering of lies:
Lamenting much their sorrow sharp
that should against them rise.
The ix. Chapter.
IN seeing what disceit did reign,
he wishes that he dwelt:
Him self alone in wilderness,
where no such thing is felt.
In knowing God we only ought
therein our joy to find:
The circumcision of the flesh,
not like that is in mind.
The x. Chapter.
Know well they might that Gods of gold
of wood and silver eke:
Be far from Gods when they can not
once go* ne stand, or speak.
Their pastors were but beasts each one
their flocks did wander wide:
In man there is no good at all,
for succor yet she ^ride.
The xi. Chapter.
LOok well they ought to keep the law,
for else he does them curse:
When they were wild for to amend,
they were so much the worse.
Their fathers steps in worship false,
they walk to their decay:
To Idols help he wilth to seek,
for them he might not pray.
The xii. Chapter.
Much muse he does at wickeds wealth
yet God remains just:
The Jews forsaken of the Lord,
in him they did not trust*
The shepherds did the sheep seduce,
and trod his vine to ground:
And if convert from sins they would,
then favor should be found.
The xiii. Chapter.
NOt words alone but signs thereto,
God addid them to warn:
But naught would help their life so bad
they Justly took their harm.
Why God to favor did them take,
and why he them refusde:
If they would mend the wicked life,
they should not be misusde.
The xiiii. Chapter.
OF dearth that on the land should fall
and how the people praid:
And such as faith did want to them,
their prayers are denaid.
The prophets that by false report,
did say from God they came:
Should feel the thing that they denied,
such peace by lies they wan.
The xv. Chapter.
PAst help they were tho Moses should
and Samuel for them pray:
Yet pestilence with sword and dearth,
and captive led away.
Should light on them yet some should rest,
to God them does he call:
In mid among the rout, God made
him as a brazen wall.
The xvi. Chapter.
QUaint not thy self with woman kind,
a wife to thee to take:
For plague I will this people sore,
and captives them will make.
In Babylon: and yet return
they shall unto this land:
The Gentiles shall their Gods forsake,
and take the truth in hand.
The xvii. Chapter.
RIght froward were the Jews and cursed
for putting trust in man:
Whose heart full wicked is and il,
God only search it can.
The living waters they forsook,
the Saboth day they brake:
Which if in time they mended not,
their fire should not ^lake.
The xviii. Chapter.
Such power as in the potter is,
to break his pottes at will:
Such power has God (who can deny?)
his foes with force to kill.
The Jews conspierd that Jeremy
should vexed be with speed:
And he to God his prayers made,
to plague them and their seed.
The xix. Chapter.
Tell thou the heads, said God to him,
that they shall perish all:
For sheding blood, and offering up
their service unto Ball.
Before them all thy bottle break
of earth out of thy hand:
Even so likewise tell them, I will
destroy them and their land.
The xx. Chapter.
When Pashur heard that Jeremy preached
he stroke him and thereto:
To iayle he went it helped not,
he taught as wunt to do.
It grieved him much yt they him mocked
he thought to hold his peace:
The word so boiled in his breast,
to speak he could not cease*
The xxi. Chapter.
AGain when he was wild to tell,
what should of them become:
He said by sword and pestilence,
all should be slain save some.
And those should be such of the Jews
as would them selves submit:
And be content in Caldey land,
as captives for to sit.
The xxii. Chapter.
BIdden he was to tell the King,
that Justice he should use:
If not, that God would utterly,
both him and his refuse.
Such as with wrong their houses build*
he cries on them woe:
Because in wealth they would not hear^
their pride should come full low.
The xxiii. Chapter.
CUrse he does here from God his mouth,
such pastors as do feed
Them selves: and let the flock alone,
God will them pay in deed.
And pastors pure he will provide,
whereof one shall be cheef:
From David's house as King to guide,
by him to have releef.
The xxiiii. Chapter.
DEclare God does by baskets twain,
with Figs both good and bad:
What should become upon the flock,
as he decreed had.
Which was that some should have return
and live in rest and peace:
The King should not with many mo,
whose hearts he could not pearce.
The xxv. Chapter.
EXiled men in Babylon,
the Jews for sin should be:
Full seventy years the Prophet says,
in their captivity.
At which years end that mighty power
shall be subverted quite.
And in like wise he telth before,
all rule shall lose their might.
The xxvi. Chapter.
Full earnestly he does them move,
their sins for to repent:
They brought him forth, he telth his tale
the Judges did relent.
But Vriah who fled for fear,
was fetched from Egypt land:
Iehoyaku of Judah King,
him slew with sword in hand.
The xxvii. Chapter.
GOd willed him that he should send
both yokes and bonds also,
To Princes, for to testify
in bondage they should go.
And who so would refuse to serve,
Nabuchodonozer,
Should plagued be, therefore he wilth
false Prophets not to hear.
The xxviii. Chapter.
HAnaniah the Prophet false
did prophecy a lie:
And Jeremy did him reprove
before great company.
Also a fresh he prophesied,
because his yoke was burst:
That bondage much should come to them
and that thereto then trust.
The xxix. Chapter.
IN written words he sent to them,
that then in Babel were,
That they should plant, and wed, and pray
for such as ruled there.
For seventy years should pass and go,
ere they should turn again:
And in that space their land and power,
should wasted be and slain.
The xxx. Chapter.
KNowledge again from Ieremies mouth,
was given to Israel:
That they should home again return,
within their land to dwell
And how that God would him revenge
upon their furious foes:
But comfort his afflicted Church,
and save her from her woes.
The xxxi. Chapter.
LArge blessing here he telth to come,
when home they should return:
All joy shall come and plesantnes,
to such as once did mourn.
A covenant new within their hearts,
also he plight to make:
That he would be their God in deed,
if they not him forsake.
The xxxii. Chapter.
MAny were the miseries that,
Jeremy did sustain:
For now he is in prison cast,
for speaking out so plain.
A feeld he bought and hid the book,
that did record the same:
His prayers he made and once again,
their turning home did name.
The xxxiii. Chapter.
NOw is the Prophet wild to pray,
for their return and rest:
Which full and whole is granted them
as they had had it erst.
With pardon for their former sins,
without their own desartes.
And Christ to reign in David's throne,
for ever in their hearts.
The xxxiiii. Chapter.
OF Zedechiah who was King,
of Judah: what should come:
How he should taken be and his,
when City and all is wun.
Because the covenant they did break,
to bond folk that they made:
Their lot with pine or pestilence,
should be or else with blade.
The xxxv. Chapter.
PUt forth he does as God him bade,
the Rechabites for lore:
Who would not break the old precepts
from fathers had tofore.
But Iewishe pride would not obey,
though often they were warnd:
Therefore to ruin they should go,
the Rechabites not harmd.
The xxxvi. Chapter.
QUenched lest yt his words should be,
God bad to write them all:
So Baruch did and red the role,
before both great and small.
The King a little heard of it,
and burnt the book in fire:
Again with more it written was,
and God provoked to ire.
The xxxvii. Chapter.
RIght soon as Zedechiah reignd,
to Jeremy he sent,
To pray for him. By Egypt power
the Caldeys away went.
As Jeremy was pressed away,
in dungeon was he cast:
But when the King had talked with him,
he begd a better taste.
The xxxviii. Chapter.
SO fairly spoke the councillors,
the Princes ears until,
That Jeremy to dungeon went,
there thought they him to kill.
An Enuche black his life did save,
and drue him up with cords:
The King and he did talk alone,
he might not tell the Lords.
The xxxix. Chapter.
THe Babel power the City took,
and Zedechiah fled:
He was over caught, his sons were slain
his eyes put out of his head.
The poor alone are left in land,
and Jeremy at large:
Who gave them more that did him good,
a comfortable charge.
The xl. Chapter.
UNto two things the Prophet had
a choice at will to choose.
Babel to see, or tarry still
the first he did refuse.
Such as for fear were fled away
to Godoliah came:
Whom Babel King had left to rule,
all Judah that he wan.
The xli. Chapter.
A Murder foul committed was
of Ismael by name:
For Godoliah he did kill,
who did deserve no blame.
And diverse more that wicked man,
their lives did also end:
And fled to King of Moabites,
who therefore did him send.
The xlii. Chapter.
Both most and least to Jeremy came
his council to have:
And willed him to know of God,
which way them selves to save.
Who willed them in any wise,
to Egypt not to wend:
For if they did that which they feared,
their God would it them send.
The xliii. Chapter.
COntrary to their former grant,
to Egypt needs they would:
The Prophet checked, and Baruch eke,
who needs with them they should.
And there did God by Jeremy,
tell Egypt of her fall:
How Nebuchadnezer in place
should rule their Gods and all.
The xliiii. Chapter.
DEclare he does unto the Jews,
for their Idolatry,
In Egypt land the which they did,
that they should surely die.
But men and wives with froward hearts
did tell what they did deem:
We never throue sins that we left,
to serve the heavenly Queen.
The xlv. Chapter.
EUilly appaid was Baruch then,
he thought his life but lost:
His sorrows did increace in him
seeing the Jews so tossed.
But Jeremy him comfort gave,
and set his heart at stay:
For God (he said) has given to thee,
thy life to be a pray.
The xlvi. Chapter.
FRom God he speaks to Egypt land,
and tells them full plain:
How that the King of Babylon,
withal his mighty train.
Should them destroy and eke their King
their God and mighty power:
But yet his chosen Jacobs seed,
he would not quite devour.
The xlvii. Chapter.
GOd bad him tell the Philistines,
of their decay and end:
That parents to such woe should come,
their Children not to tend.
How they of Tire and Zidon eke,
should wasted be also:
The wrath of God not ceasing til,
their pride were come full low.
The xlviii. Chapter.
HE telleh to the Moabites,
their ruin and decay:
Who once like churles to Israel,
ungraciously did say.
He curses them that should them spare,
or stay his hand from blood:
And that because their pride was such,
and hautie stubborn mood.
The xlix. Chapter.
IN like (he says) the Ammonites,
whose valleys were so fair
And Esaus stock the Edomites,
that thought of no despair.
Damascus and Kedar also,
whom nothing did anoy:
With Elam eke, all these he said,
the Caldes should destroy.
The l. Chapter.
KNoweledge tofore of Babels fall,
he gave also to them:
How that the Persians and the Medes,
should quite destroy their steme*
And how that God upon his flock,
would have a new regard:
And them restore into their state,
and give their foes reward.
The li. chapter.
LArgely he writes and telth the cause,
of Babels fall and spoil:
In Isreal's blood they did rejoice,
when that they had the foil.
The power of God he does describe,
and Idols vain denies:
He says the Caldeys should so fall,
as never more to rise.
The lii. Chapter.
MArk well what rebels come unto,
let Zedechiah preach:
He first rebeld and after fled,
his foes did him areche.
The temple burnt, the City stroyd,
and thousands captive led:
But Iehoyakim favor found,
the King lift up his head.
FINIS.
Thus Jeremy that lived so long,
and Kings so many saw:
That bode such broils for saying sooth,
to those that had no awe.
His tale is told, his book is done,
now shall you hear us tell,
How woefully he did lament,
the fall of Israel.

The Lamentation of Jeremy*
The i. Chapter.
ALl help is past, Jerusalem,
is now subverted quite:
Her friends are now become her foes
when failed is her might.
Her streets are void her priests are slain,
her foes they do rejoice:
Nothing but tears and heuines,
has sin set for her choice.
The ii. chapter.
Behold the holds are now destroyed,
the Princes overthrown:
The Saboths and the holy place,
they cannot now be known.
The Uirgins and the Seniours,
sit weeping on the ground:
The enemies do clap their hands,
no comfort can be found.
The iii. Chapter.
COmplain he does of all the greefs,
that many ways he felt:
And yet in God he puts his trust,
that always his has helped.
For sin, the Lord does his correct,
which best is to confess:
And then he will his favor send,
and things amiss redress.
The iiii. Chapter.
DOutles the wise like to fine Gold,
are now like potters clay:
The Nazarites that were so fair,
their beauty is away.
With hunger women sore oppressed,
their Children they do eat:
The bloody priests and Prophets false
did bring to them this meat.
The v. Chapter.
ENd here his Lamentations,
he does with earnest prayer:
Beseeching God to look upon,
how foes with them did fare.
Confessing yet that he does reign
and shall for evermore:
Who turning us then shall we turn,
and surely not before.
FINIS.
Ezechiel does now begin,
to fortify and prove:
That God would sure the Iewishe Church,
as he had said, remove.
By visions strange he does express,
the things to come to pass:
As he in Caldey land did dwell,
where he a captive was.
Yet comfort does he give again,
to the afflicted flock:
And telth the ruin of their foes,
and such as did them mock.
But cheef of all the regiment,
of Christ's kingdom pure,
He does see out an happy state,
for ever to endure.

The Prophecy of Ezechiel*
The i. Chapter.
AS he in Caldey land did dwell,
by Chobar river side:
In the fifth year that Iehoyakim*
the King did there abide.
Ezechiel a vision,
of fowls and wheels did see:
And one upon a bow did sit,
on hie in majesty.
The ii. chapter.
BIdden he was for to stand up,
and speak against the Jews,
Their sins rebuke, and how they should
his preaching quite refuse.
Rebelling still, as auncetours
of them had done before:
A hand he saw that held a book,
that sorrows threat therefore.
The iii. chapter.
CAused he was to eat the book,
and boldenes God him gave
With strength and power, with word and sprite
him self for to behave.
His charge is given, his office set,
which if he should neglect,
The folk in sin should perish all,
and he for blood be checked.
The iiii. Chapter.
DEclare he does Jerusalem
besieged for to be:
And many years the Israelites,
to feel captivity.
And hunger such on them to fall,
as like has not been heard:
Their excrementes of force to eat,
good food should be so bard.
The v. chapter.
Eftsoons a sign to him was given,
by shauing of his hear:
By burning some, by wherling some,
and little some to spare.
That so (...) with the Pestilence,
with sword and famine great:
Should be dispersed and eke so plagued,
as Child the Fathers meat.
The vi. chapter.
FOr woorshipping of Images,
and Idols that are vain:
On tops on hills, and eke in vales,
he says they shall be slain.
A remnant yet there shall be left,
that in their woeful greef:
Shall them repent and turn to God,
and have of him releef.
The vii. Chapter.
GOd does by him tell plainly out,
the ruin of the land:
From Est to west, from north to south,
no part of it to stand.
But all should be subverted quite,
he will not change his mind:
In priest or else in ancient man,
no council should they find.
The viii. Chapter.
HE sitting in his house among,
the ancients in exile,
Jerusalem he went unto,
in vision for a while.
And there such evils in secret place,
he saw them to commit
And eke abroad which caused just,
them to be plagde for it.
The ix. Chapter.
Jerusalem that did commit,
such evils as were to bad,
Has now such measure meett to them,
as once they mesured had.
But one yclad in linen white,
did mark the mourning sort*
And they did escape when ruin fell,
the marker made report.
The x. chapter.
Know moore he does of things tofore,
The man arayd in white:
Did fire fetch from Cherubins,
appearing to his sight.
And then the beasts and eke the wheels,
that he had seen tofore:
He saw again in vision wise,
with sundry faces four.
The xi. Chapter.
LEd now he was for to behold
the cheef that ruled il:
And wild to say that they should pay,
for blood that they did spil.
A ruler died, then out he cride
to God to hold his hand:
His bown is heard, and Cherubs gone,
and he in Caldey land.
The xii. Chapter.
MOre plainly by a fardle born,
and packing in the day:
Their thraldom and captivity,
thereby perceive they may.
A remnant yet should saved be,
to tell of all their gilt:
And speedely the wrath should come,
though otherways they built.
The xiii. Chapter.
NOw does he tell the Prophets false,
what should of them betide:
Their daubed wall that they had made,
it should not long abide.
Their women eke that pillowes made,
and kercheues for to charm,
Should perish to, for promising
the wicked safe from harm.
The xiiii. Chapter.
OF such as Idols in their hearts
did keep, and yet pretends*
The contrary, and Prophets false,
he telth of both their ends.
Yet still a remnant God will keep,
his Church for to increace:
The righteous men alone shall escape,
their sin he will releace.
The xv. Chapter.
PRofitable is not the wood,
that comes of the vine:
No longer then it bears fruit,
whereof is made the wine:
Even so likewise Jerusalem,
that brings forth no fruit,
Shall Be consumde with fire at home
and eke in her pursuit.
The xvi. Chapter.
Quench now their pride, he go'th about
their progeny to tell:
How bare they were, how God the^ clad,
they did that was not well.
For Sodom nor Samaria,
such whordome woorked not:
In woorship false to Idols vain,
as never more was wrought.
The xvij. chapter.
Rehearse he does by Egles twain,
what shall of Israel hap:
Who thought to plant in Egypt power,
but it should take no sap.
Their King also that promise made,
to Babel to obey:
For breaking of his oath to him,
full deerly he should pay.
The xviii Chapter.
Some (where it falth) shall have reward,
in him that does it use:
Each man shall bear his own offense,
he shall none other choose.
But who so does his sin repent,
shall pardon have therefore:
And he that does good life forsake,
shall pay full deer therefore.
The xix. Chapter.
Tell now he does what Lions sprang
out of the Lioness:
What catching Kings, Jerusalem
did breed to her distress.
How as a vine she floorisht once,
and did from thence decay:
And therefore now in wilderness,
there should she dry away.
The xx. Chapter.
UNto him came the elders then,
who did to them declare,
For all their sin from time to time,
how God yet did them spare,
Not hearing such as yielded not,
but wrath upon them take,
And spare the rest that feared him,
even for his mercies sake.
The xxi, Chapter.
A Sword he says shall all devour
and spare ne hie nor low:
The Babel power should all destroy,
inchauntment taught him so.
The Ammonites should also quail,
their kingdom should be wun:
The Babel power should them destroy,
where they their life begun.
The xxii. Chapter.
Behold this chapter, mark it well,
how all was out of frame:
What sins there reignd in Israel,
he does unto you name.
The rulers and the Prophets eke,
the priests and people all,
In sundry sins withouten shame
each one of them did fall.
The xxiii. Chapter.
COmparison of women twain,
that whoredom do commit,
He does compare to Israel,
and Judah like to it.
Whose filthy foul Idolatry,
provoked God to ire:
The Child first born they spared not,
to burn in flaming fire.
The xxiiii. Chapter.
DEclare he does by double signs,
what they shall come until:
As flesh in pot does seethe to scum,
so should they for their il.
His wife does die, he mourned not,
as he of God was wild:
No more should they have space thereto,
when that their friends were killed.
The xxv. Chapter.
Evil hap should come of Ammonites,
and Moabites by name:
Because they did rejoice and laugh,
when Israel had blame.
The Edomites and Philistines,
should eke stoup to the Est,
That is to say to Babel power,
and be of them possessed.
The xxvi. Chapter.
FOr like offense that City great,
that Tirus ^ight by name:
Should have the foil and be possessed
of strangers to their shame.
The Isles and merchantes wunder shall,
when they shall hear the same:
A City new in ruin great,
that was of mickle fame.
The xxvij. chapter.
GReat was the wealth that Tirus had,
he does tell it at length:
Their fame, their name, their quiet state
their power and eke their strength.
All these with all their men and might,
their force by sea and land:
Should be destroyed for evermore,
by might of foreign band.
The xxviii. Chapter.
HE tells now what pride he had,
that Tirus ruled as King:
And of his fall and City eke,
they fearing no such thing.
To Zidon to he shows as much,
that like on them should fall:
And how Gods folk should live in peace
when foes were stroyed all.
The xxix. Chapter.
IN like he says that Egypt power,
should quite be over run:
And forty years it should lie waste,
after that it were wun.
The King of Babel should it have,
to be his soldiers gains:
Because at Tirus they did win
small profit for their pains.
The xxx. Chapter.
Know well you may he does not fain
but telth again their woe:
Their cu^trie spoild, their Cities down,
their neighbors served so.
Their Idols eke should be defaste,
their strength should not avail:
Their foes with force of God his power
so fiercely should assail.
The xxxi. Chapter.
LIke power to the Assirians,
in Egypt could not be:
And yet Nabuchodonozer,
the same destroyed he.
This he does tell that they should think,
that they might not withstand
The rage of Babel when it com'th,
for to destroy the land.
The xxxii. Chapter.
Much more to make now is he wild,
for Pharo that was King,
Who should be slain, and river full
of blood should over spring.
As other Kings were ouerrun,
and brought unto the pit,
So Egypt pride should have a fall,
as just reward for it.
The xxxiii. Chapter.
NOte well this thing when preachers preach
and warning men do give,
They be dischargd if they repent:
they shall be sure to live.
Each man shall bear his own offense,
the godly shall have meed:
They that did rest and at him jest,
full wickedly should speed.
The xxxiiii. Chapter.
OF shepherds that their profit seek,
and not the sheep to feed,
He does describe what God will do,
even pay them for their meed,
And take his flock in hand him self,
dividing sheep from sheep,
And give the flock at length to Christ,
which truly shall them keep.
The xxxv. Chapter.
PUblishe unto Idumea,
he does what God would do:
Because that Israel they had grieved,
they should be grieved to.
As blooddely the Israelites,
they had with war oppressed:
So should their blood be spilt again,
and none of them have rest.
The xxxvi. Chapter.
QUicken he does the Israelites,
that they should not despair:
For God would all their foes destroy,
and them again repair.
His mercy only moving him,
and not of their desartes,
And take from them their stony minds,
and give them fleshy hearts.
The xxxvii. Chapter.
RIght soon as he in feeld was set,
a miracle he wrought:
For dried bones took flesh and breath,
that God unto them brought.
By which he telth that Israel,
that seemed to be gone,
Should safe return and Judah both,
and be eke joined in one.
The xxxviii. Chapter.
Such enemies as should arise
he does them here describe:
As Gog and Magog in their power,
the Church for to deride.
And they to come in latter days,
as Prophets told tofore:
Yet God should stay their furious rage,
and punish them therefore.
The xxxix. Chapter.
THe Lord is bent against this Gog,
a wretched end to have:
Their slaughter such seven months to seek
to bring them unto grave.
Then shall his people rest in peace,
and heathen told the cause:
Why Israel afflicted was,
for breaking of his laws.
The xl. Chapter.
UNto the City he is rapt,
and there he does behold
The building of it fair again,
as it was to him told.
From gate to gate all mesurde out
an angel with a reed
An eke a line, did point the same,
as it should be in deed.
The xli. Chapter.
AT large to him described was,
the temple then of God:
And mesurde out by Cubits meet,
even with a reedy rod.
The holy place, the Cherubins,
and eke the Palmy trees:
The courts, the doors, with all at large,
in vision he sees.
The xlii. Chapter.
BRought now he is to th'vtter court,
the chambers for to see:
In length and breadth, and told he is
that there the priests should be
Appointed for to tire them selves,
their portion eke to eat:
And holy rowmes therein, to lay,
the sacrificing meat.
The xliii. Chapter.
COme now he is for to behold,
the glory of the Lord:
Who wilth him tell the Israelites,
that they shall be restorde,
If they repent their former life,
and do no more there after:
Then does he see set out to him,
the fashion of the altar.
The xliiii. Chapter.
DEclare he does good wholesome rules
his priests for to observe:
Look which of them had Idols likte,
as priests they might not serve.
What robes to were, what wives to take,
to them is here expressed:
At burials they might not come,
ne feed of rented beast.
The xlv. Chapter.
ELect apart four portions were
within the holy land:
For Priests, for Prince, for City and Church,
each lot set out with wand.
A lesson given to Magistrates
for measure and for weight:
Oblations eke how them to make,
is here set out full straight.
The xlvi. Chapter.
FOr sacrifice on Saboth days,
the order here they know:
In temple where the folk came in,
there out they might not go.
The Prince in middle of them all,
must be when God they serve:
Til he go out a charge they have,
from him they may not swerve.
The xlvii. Chapter.
GOd does him show the plesa^t stremes
that from the gates should run:
What plenty of fish should therein be,
for fisher men to come.
On sides whereof what trees should grow
that monthly fruit should bear:
The borders of the holy land,
it is appointed there.
The xlviii. Chapter.
Here now by lot is pointed out,
each tribe how he should lie:
The priests and Levites have their parts
the holy temple by.
Whose portion eke is pointed out,
and all the Cities shore:
The Prince again his part is told,
this Prophet speaks no more.
FINIS.
Thus have you heard this Prophet speak,
unto the people tho:
That captives were in Caldey land,
and unto sundry mo.
Now comes in that man of wit,
a Seer you may say:
Who told before of Monarchies,
their reign and their decay.
The Roman power he tells of,
of Turk and Antechriste:
Of golden days that should be seen,
in regiment of Christ.
His name to tell is Daniel,
that deemed doughtie dreams:
Who still did win of enemies,
for all their crafty means.

The Prophecy of Daniel.
The first Chapter.
ANd when the King of Babylon,
Jerusalem had wun:
Yung men of Jews for to be kept,
he willed to be done.
Their fare was set they it refusde,
and eat and drank full hard:
Yet were they fair and wisdom had
none were to them comparde.
The ii. Chapter.
BUt Daniel, there was not one,
could tell the King his dream:
Who told it him and this thereto,
the truth what it did mean.
For which he was a ruler made,
the cheef and next the King:
His fellows three did rule also,
to which he did them bring.
The iii. Chapter.
Commanded were the multitude
an Image to adore:
Sidrach, Misach, Abednago,
would not to die therefore.
Into an oven then were they cast,
alive with one they walked:
The King it saw and called them out,
and with them freendly talked.
The iiii. Chapter.
DReam did the King another dream,
which Daniel did expound:
How that the King for his great pride,
as Ox should feed on ground.
And that seven years, the which he did,
and after ruled again:
Confessing God to have the might,
and he alone to reign.
The v. Chapter.
Even as before a prideful Prince,
came now again in place:
Who proudly drank in holy place,
and saw before his face,
A hand did write upon a wall,
which Daniel told full plain:
The Medies and the Persians,
shoule rule when he was slain.
The vi. Chapter.
Full mighty power had Daniel tho,
the Princes did him hate:
In Lions den they got him cast,
but naught by it they gat:
He was preserved, they were deuourd,
their families and all.
King Darie gave commandment,
on Daniels God to call.
The vii. Chapter.
GRreat beasts were seen in number four
of Daniel in his bed:
By vision he this sight did see,
which troubled sore his head.
Four Monarchies these beasts did show
their horns were kingdoms ten:
In latter days God by his son,
he should destroy them then.
The viii. Chapter.
HE now does see a mighty Ram,
whose force none could resist:
But with his horns he ruled all,
and did even what him list.
The Medies and the Persians,
they were the Ram so whot:
The Grecian power did them destroy
compared to a Got.
The ix. Chapter.
IN this place Daniel does desire,
that that which Jeremy said:
Might be fulfild and then confess
his sin he did and prayed.
The prayer is heard, the seventy weeks
the Angel did expound:
The City is built, and Christ is born,
to them that did him wound.
The x. Chapter.
KIng Cirus ruling Persia,
the third year of his reign,
A man clothed in linen white,
appeerd to him again,
And told him things that were to come,
at which he was abasht:
But that Gods Angel made him strong,
his countenance had dashed.
The xi. Chapter.
LIke as before so now again,
of Kings to him is told:
The Persian power, the might of Greece,
and eke of Egypt bold:
Of Siria as some suppose,
and last of Romans might.
These kingdoms all not one to fail,
against the Church should fight.
The xii. Chapter.
MIchael then that mighty Prince,
shall stand for to defend,
The Church of Christ the general day
the troubles quite shall end,
Wherein to bliss some shall arise,
and some to bitter pain:
Some shall their faults amend before,
and some in sin remain.
FINIS.
Daniel now his mind has said,
as God to him did tell:
His sight he had in things to come,
all others did excel.
The Jews that in captivity,
in Caldey land did dwell:
He them reueald with joyful speech,
deep sorrows to expel.
Hosea he does follow next,
who then did prophecy:
When Israel quite from their King,
Rehoboam did fly.
He told them of their service vain,
in Bethel unto calves:
How vain it was unto such Gods,
to seek for helthful salues.
Three score and ten they were his years
to ten tribes that he preached:
Say what he could they mended not,
they scorned that he teacht.
The vengeance due for sinful life,
he vouched to be sure:
And mixed among Gods mercies great,
by it them to allure.
To worship God as law did will,
set out by him above:
And leaving all their own intents,
so should they have his love.

The Prophecy of Hosea.
The first Chapter.
A Harlot he is wild to wed,
of whom he sons begat:
The whorishe life of Israel,
is signified by that.
The Gentiles should be called in,
Gods people for to be:
And all the tribes should join in one,
and lovingly agree.
The ii. Chapter.
GEcause with Ball they did commit
most filthy whordome, so,
The Prophet them does threat for it,
God forth their filth to show.
Except that they repent and mend:
which if they do, that then
As spoused wife most husband like,
he would them love as when,
The iii. Chapter.
CAst of (he says) the Jews should be
as drunk with Gods full vain:
To take a harlot he is wild,
to show the thing again.
That King or priest they should not have
and that for many days:
And yet at length Christ should them save
to whom they should give praise.
The iiii. Chapter.
DEclare he does how sin did reign,
and none mislikte the same:
Both Princes, people, and the priests
in sinning had no shame.
Wherefore he threats that God will strike
and punish them therefore.
So that to Idols sacrifice,
they should do so no more.
The v. Chapter.
Eftsoons the sins he does tell out,
of Israel by name:
From most to least they mended not,
to God their lives to frame.
God should they seek, then would he not
of them again be found:
Of other power for aid they should,
and so them selves confound.
The vi. Chapter.
Full fast to God they did then hie,
repenting of their il:
So knowledge they should have to do^,
that God to them did will.
The Prophets spared not to cut,
their sin with words so sharp:
The priests to steal by one consent,
no other thing they carp.
The vii. Chapter.
GOne all affray the people were
their King they did disceiue:
As Bakers oven so burned they,
in sin to which they cleave.
Their trust they had in Egypt help,
shall not them help in deed:
They turned them but not aright
when that they were in need.
The viii. Chapter.
HOw they a King and rulers eke,
did choose but not by God:
And Idols vain did cleave unto,
which he had them forbod.
For which their sin he will them pay
to teach them to offend:
With fire their City shall be burnt*
to Egypt shall they wend.
The ix. Chapter.
IN leading of an whorishe life,
an hunger shall they have:
They said the Prophet was a fool,
the spiritual men did rave.
Their wombs and breasts should dried (...),
their children long not live:
And for a pray unto their foes,
he would them also give.
The x. chapter.
KIng over them they should have none
their Idols should be stroyd
Both Judah and Samaria*
they should be sore anoyd.
To plough and reap in righteousness
and mercy they are wild:
If not betime in the morning,
their King he should be killed.
The xi. Chapter.
Lovingly from Egypt land,
he says that he them led:
And cherisht them with food thereto,
and gave them heavenly bread.
Full loathe he is to punish them,
though it they do deserve:
Thou Ephraim misvsde it self,
yet Judah did not swerve.
The xii. Chapter.
Much crookednes did Ephraim use,
with Judah does he talk:
As Jacob liu'de and pleased God,
so would he have them walk.
In tabernacles they should dwell,
as in their solemn feasts:
Because they served not their God,
nor did regard his heastes.
The xiii. Chapter.
NO end they made of woorshipping
their Idols and their calves:
Yet God their God remains God,
none else for sin has salues.
Yet Lion like he will them use,
but so as for a time,
The death of death he says to be,
and bring them down that clime.
The xiiii. Chapter.
OF Isreal's return he telth,
how foreign power they leave:
They do confess they did transgress,
now unto God they cleave.
Who will the^ bless and make them grow,
whose branches shall so shed:
That others shall return by them,
and lack the life they led.
FINIS.
Hoseas here has told his mind,
a Prophet full of zeal:
And Joel now beginth to speak,
Gods counsel to reveal.

The Prophecy of Joel.
The first Chapter.
A Famine he does tell to come,
their fruit for to destroy:
He wilth ye dru^kards for to mourn,
their throtes should be full dry.
Their wine, their oil, their wheat and corn
should be destroyed with blasting:
Therefore he wilth them to proclaim,
a common prayer and fasting.
The ii. chapter.
Behold a power shall come on them,
to ruin and to waste:
Therefore to turn and to repent,
he wills them make haste.
And then the Lord to them will turn,
and bless them in his love:
Their sons and daughters shall have gifts
signs shall be from above.
The iii. chapter.
Control he will the enemies,
that had destroyed his land:
And serve them so as they had done,
when they had them in hand.
Let Judah now make spear and sheeld,
let Gentiles quake and fear:
The Lord him self will pitche the field,
Jerusalem to cheer.
FINIS.
Thus Ioels tale is finished,
three Chapters full of lore:
Now Amos does as much contain,
and twice so many more.

The Prophecy of Amos.
The i. Chapter.
AMos he did Prophecy,
in Ieroboams days
Damascus and the Philistines
shall perish as he says*
Tirus and Idumea,
the like shall be their lot:
And Ammon for his cruelty,
which was the son of Lot.
The ii. Chapter.
BEcause of Moabs cruelty,
against the Edomites:
Both he and Judah for their factes
shall see full woeful sights.
The Israelites for careless spoil,
shall flee before their foes:
What woorks for them the Lord had wrought
he breefly to them shows.
The iii. Chapter.
CAn any thing be wrought or done,
but God does woork the same?
His Prophets that do prophecy,
they do it in his name.
That Israel shall be destroyed,
by Egypt God does tell:
Samaria and Bethel eke,
shall have their fee as well.
The iiii. Chapter.
DOwn will he throw their rulers eke,
for spoiling of the poor:
They thought by outward holiness,
to escape so sharp a shoure.
By famine and great scarsitie,
by pestilence and sword,
He punished them: it would not serve,
to bring them to his word.
The v. Chapter.
Evil hap should fall on Israel,
for them he does lament:
Leave of from wrong he wills them,
with speed for to repent.
It will not serve their sacrifice,
ne burning of incence:
When Judgment runs as water flud
he will with them dispense.
The vi. Chapter.
Full plesantly their Princes liu'de,
deliting all in ease:
With meat and drink and melody,
thus they them selves did please.
Therefore the Lord did swear their end,
they trusted in their strength:
As captive men they should be led
therefore away at length.
The vii. Chapter.
Give signs he does by Grasshoppers,
by fire and lined wall*
That God would stroy the Israelites,
and overthrow them all.
Amaziah unto the King,
of Amos did complain,
And him rebukte, but he him told
what thereby he should gain.
The viii. Chapter.
HE yet again does tell the heads,
how they the poor oppress:
And used shameful robbery,
in making measures less*
For which they should be over run,
and perish with the sword:
A famine he would send on them,
the wanting of his word.
The ix. Chapter.
IF all the ways they seek they can,
yet shall they not put by:
But both the temple and them selves,
he will them both destroy.
Yet will he fifth as in a ^iue,
his chosen from the rest
And home they shall return again,
and live in quiet rest.
FINIS.
This Shepherd he has told his mind,
that came from keeping sheep*
Now Obadiah does come in,
to comfort them that weep.

The Prophecy of Obadiah.
The first Chapter.
A Prophecy he does declare,
against the Edomites
For vexing of their Uncles kin,
in their malicious spices.
And when that they destroyed be,
for hurting Jacob so:
Then shall the Church full quiet be,
and rid from all their woe.
FINIS.
So does this Prophet end his words,
more speech he does not use:
Now Jonas you shall hear to tell,
to Niniuie her news.

The Prophecy of Jonas.
The first Chapter.
AS God him bad he would not do,
but fled another way:
In ship, a tempest did arise
they cast him in the sea.
In doing so they pardon axt,
a Whale did him devour:
Three days and nights the fishes womb
was unto him a boure.
The ii. chapter.
BEing thus of the fish possessed,
his prayer he did make:
Protesting such as follow lies,
Gods mercies they forsake.
But Jonas says that he will pay
the vows he took in hand:
As God did will, so did the Whale
this Prophet cast on land.
The iii. chapter.
Commanded was he once again,
to Niniuie to show:
In forty days they mending not,
God would them overthrow.
A fasting then proclaimed was,
the King and they repented:
For mending of their former life,
God stayed that was invented.
The iiii. Chapter.
DIspleased greatly Jonas was,
that Niniuie was sparde:
Without the City in a boothe,
there angerly he farde.
A gourd sprang up and shaded him,
that it decayed he chod:
For Niniuee he cared less,
so is he told of God.
FINIS.
Here Jonas book is finished,
in chapters four set out:
Now Michah shall appeer to you,
the same we go about.

The Prophecy of Michah.
The first Chapter.
AS God him bad he spares not
but plainly does he tell:
That down should go the kingdoms both
of Judah and Israel.
This was the cause Idolatry,
that foully they did use.
For which the power of foreign folk,
should them and theirs abuse.
The ii. Chapter.
BEcause the mighty men did spoil,
the poor of house and feeld:
He tells them God would them plagin
their foes should make them yield.
They wantonly did mock and skorne,
the preachers that did preach:
He that of wine would preach to them,
he be^^ of all did teach.
The iii. Chapter.
CRy out he does against the heds,
that did the people spoil
And says their cry it should be heard,
when they should have the foil.
Their Prophets did for money preach,
the rulers built in blood:
Their glorious state should therefore down
in Gods displeasing mood.
The iiii. Chapter.
Divine he does that Christ his Church
shall floorishe over all:
And that far of to serve the Lord,
one shall another call.
Their worldly cares and warlike mind,
shall quite be laid aside:
Though some conspire their overthrow,
it shall not so betide.
The v. chapter.
ERe that they should attain this peace,
much troubles should they have:
Jerusalem with all her power,
her self she should not save.
But Bethlehem Ephraita,
that little was in sight,
A Captain forth should bring to them,
of endless power and might.
The vi. Chapter.
FOr them what God had done he telth,
thereby them to provoke,
That righteousness they might embrace,
and were an humble yoke.
False weightes and mesures they did use,
the people to deceive:
Therefore the poison of their fruits,
with labor lost should leave.
The vii. Chapter.
GReatly now does he mourn, because
so few did fear the Lord:
No trust in friend could then be found,
their lives were to untoward.
But yet he wilth the foes to stop,
to rage against his flock:
Affirming God to keep his grant,
to Abram and his stock.
FINIS.
The mind of Michah you have heard,
a tale full plain he told:
Now Nahum speaks to Niniuie,
a Prophet sharp and bold.

The Prophecy of Nahum.
The first Chapter.
Almighty Lord is God in deed,
his power it passes all:
All lofty things he can destroy,
and keep his friends from thrall.
The wicked shall consumed be,
that Judah did molest:
So should their feasts be kept again,
and they should live in rest.
The ii. Chapter.
Behold as Jacob was destroyed,
so should the Assirian power:
The Caldies should with force and might,
their land and them devour.
Their Queen as captive should be led,
their treasures quite bereft:
Their mighty men so Lionlike,
to them should not be left.
The iii. Chapter.
CAst down God will the Ninevites,
that ^^owed so in pride:
The glory that that City had,
it should be set aside*
Their multitude should not them help,
nor mighty men them aid:
Their City burnt, their land destroyed
the wrath should not be stayed.
FINIS.
What Nahum said to Niniuie,
to you has been expressed:
Now Abacuck his Prophecy,
it com'th among the rest.

The Prophecy of Abacuck.
The first Chapter.
ALl wickedness did flow at ^il,
no sinful life did want:
The law put by and righteousness,
among them then was s^ant.
Because the godly went to wrack,
the Caldeys God would raise:
To teach them fish as fishers do,
and make of them their prays.
The ii. Chapter.
BE bold of this ye prideful men
your pride shall come full low:
But righteous men by faith shall live,
your fall the world shall know.
The covetous and blooddy men,
the drunkards in his fre,
The Idol and the worshipper,
shall be consumde with fire.
The iii. Chapter.
CAll unto God the Prophet does,
and for his Church does pray:
Describing God his majesty,
in power to pass for ay.
Beseeching him his foes to strike,
with mercy to correct
His chosen flock, and thus he ends,
his book to much effect.
FINIS.
Thus Abacuck has told his tale,
full boldly to the Jews:
And Sophoniah comes next,
to tell them the same news.

The Prophecy of Sophoniah.
The first Chapter.
ALl living things the Lord will stroy,
with man for his offense:
And Judah and Jerusalem,
should have their recompense.
A woeful ruin will he make,
for halting in their faith:
Their strength, their goods, should not the^ help
but perish they should he says
The ii. Chapter.
BEfore his wrath do come in deed,
he wilth them to repent:
The kingdoms of the Philistines,
for sin it should be rent.
The Moabites the Ammonites,
for ioying Isreal's fall,
With Morians and Ninevites,
should be destroyed all.
The iii. Chapter.
COrrupted were the Judges all,
the priests and Prophets vain:
Not one would mend what so was said,
nor turn to God again.
The Gentiles shall converted be,
the remnant of his flock
Shall turn again and live in peace,
and be a faithful stock.
FINIS.
Sophoniah thus he has said,
as God did will him speak:
Now Haggay with his mouth vnclosde,
his mind to you shall break.

The Prophecy of Haggay*
The first Chapter.
ALl hope was past for to return,
from Babylon again:
God plagued them and al their fruits
their labors were in vain.
He found great fault they builded so,
and that his house was down:
And willed them with speed to build
his temple and his town.
The ij. chapter.
Behold the glory of the house,
which Solomon did build,
Should not be like to this (he says)
nor no such beauty yield.
God will them bless with plenteousnes
if they will patient be:
Their foes shall fall but they shall reign
and come to hie degree.
FINIS.
Haggay has told his tale,
and made the people glad:
Zachariah ye shall have next,
as ye the rest have had.

The Prophecy of Zachariah.
The first Chapter.
AGain to God if they would turn*
he would turn unto them:
Or else as to their forefathers,
so would he do to them.
Jerusalem shall be new built,
by vision it is told:
The careless heathen shall be shent,
for wasting of his fold.
The ij. chapter.
BE bold of this, the temple shall
be built again in deed:
An Angel did the same declare,
and that they should not dreed.
For God would be their full defense,
and unto them a wall,
And bring their foes to be their pray,
no power withstand them shall.
The iii. Chapter.
COrrected was Satan the Devil,
that would the woork have let:
And Iehosuah that was hie Priest
was specially out set.
His filthy clothes were made full fair,
if he will walk aright:
The multitude shall him obey,
and have in him delight.
The iiii. Chapter.
DEclare on forth the Angel does,
by vision full plain:
Jerusalem in goodly wise,
should be set up again.
Who should it build how foes should sin,
and friends should somewhat faint
But God his woork should fortify
by Christ his holy saint.
The v. Chapter.
Evil hap and curse shall fall on these,
the swearer and the thief:
A flying book shall them consume,
and theirs for their mischeef.
As Judah had afflicted been,
in Babel for their gilt:
So Babel now like smart should have,
and utterly be spilt.
The vi. Chapter.
Four Monarchies by charets four^,
he does describe to come,
As sent from God to rule the world,
by whom it should be wun.
The hie priest had his golden crowns,
Iehosua by name:
And he the building should set out
and win a nobl^ fame.
The vii. Chapter.
GOd does their fasting disalow,
their mourning was in vain*
They eat and drank unto them selves,
they still did gape for gain.
When he did call they would not hear,
his statutes to obey:
They shall cry out but he shall turn,
his ear from them away.
The viii. Chapter.
HE will restore them home again,
and stay his wrathful rage:
They shall full long there rest in peace,
enjoying sta^es for age,
Deceit and wrong they must forsake,
forswearing eke defy:
The Gentiles shall their lore well like,
and thereunto apply.
The ix. Chapter.
IN wrathful mood for all their pride,
he will the Gentiles waste:
Both Tire and Zidon in their wealth,
he will them over cast.
But sure his church he will defend,
by Christ his son so meek:
^he lowely sitting on an Ass*
yet shall they to him seek.
The x. chapter.
Know here you may what Idols be,
soothsayers foolish art:
To Judah he will freendly be,
and fully take their part.
To Ephraim he will favor show,
and give to them such might:
That foreign power they shall not fear
but shall put them to flight.
The xi Chapter.
Low will he bring them in his wrath,
both shepherds and their sheep,
Because they had no more respect
his statutes for to keep.
The shepherds wagis it is paid,
and thirty pieces told:
The potter had it given to him,
so was our master sold.
The xii Chapter.
MEruaylously the Lord will woor^,
for Judah in his power:
Jerusalem shall plagued be,
her foes shall it devour.
Yet shall they both great favor find,
and come to happy case:
Their foes shall faint but they shall joy,
and find a resting place.
The xiii. Chapter.
NO more will God think on their sin,
their Idols shall away:
Their Prophets false they will destroy,
their parents shall them pay:
The shepherd should so stricken be,
that scatter should the sheep.
The people then to God shall flee,
full well he will them keep.
The xiiii. Chapter.
Oppressed should be Jerusalem,
and be set up again.
Much people shall to her resort,
the way it shall be plain.
The most of them that hated her,
consumde shall be and slain:
And those that come not to her feast,
shall want their yearly reign.
FINIS.
Thus Zachary is finished,
now Malachy shall speak:
The last he is that to the Jews,
the mind of God did break.
He and the two that spoke before,
the Jews did comfort give:
When they thought least then home to go
in peace and rest to live.
Til John did come that did Baptize,
no Prophet did appeer:
This Prophets speaks unto the Preests,
his words now let us hear.

The Prophecy of Malachy.
The first Chapter.
A Loving mind to Israel
always the Lord did ^ear,
And yet both they and eke their priests
they had of him no fear.
The altar and his table both,
they past not to abuse:
Polluted things they offer did,
on gain their hearts did muse.
The ii. Chapter.
BEcause they did their office il,
their blessing he will curse:
Their parent first did not so well,
but they did mickle wurse.
Their marriages they were amiss,
their heart was not aright:
Therefore despisde, God let them be
and that in each man's sight.
The iii. Chapter.
COme speedely shall Christ in deed
but John shall come before:
And wrongful life shall pass away,
God shall good life restore.
The prosperous state of wicked men,
did somewhat them molest:
But at the length they should well see
that God did them detest.
The iiii. Chapter.
DOutles the day shall come (says he)
that God the proud will burn:
But save he will the faithful men,
which unto him do turn.
Eliah he shall come before,
John Baptist it does mean:
Who shall the sons and fathers teach
their hearts for to be clean.
FINIS.
The Prophets thus are finished,
and books Canonical:
Apocripha ye shall have next,
if death do not me call.
Then some I hope will finishe that*
which my good will began:
All shall be one in me or him,
so that you have it th^n.
