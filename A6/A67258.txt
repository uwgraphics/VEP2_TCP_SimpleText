THE PREFACE.
THE chief intention of publishing these discourses is, to suggest to devout
persons some few, but copious, heads for their Meditation. To which purpose it
is not amiss to premise:

That in meditating on any action or passion of our Savior; consider his
person doing or suffering it, not as man, but God and Man. Either of which will
produce affections in you diverse from the other; both full of Benefit. When
you consider him as Man; you will more admire and love, in human infirmity, his
innocence, and all his heroical virtues, and merits; and compassionate his
indign sufferings; and, these being for you also, in representing to your self
such his human weakness, it will render them far more dearer unto you; and your
gratitude much more to him. As he is man, you will have a more familiar
confidence in his goodwill toward you: more interest your self in, and
endeavor to imitate, what he did and suffered; and more firmly believe, that
it shall be done unto you (if being like him) what was done by God to him.

But again, when you consider him as God; not a word, not an answer, not a
circumstance of any action of his, passes without your admiration, and deep
reverence of it; you will be astonished that such Majesty and power should so
low descend for your sake; and be infinitely more ready to fear, to praise, to
love, to admire, to sacrifice all you are, and have, unto him: and then grieve,
comparing it with his, i. e. Gods love to you, that it is so inconsiderable:
you will discover new wisdom in every passage of his story: and his sufferings,
humility, mildness, it will still greaten to you as his person does. You will
not only make your addresses with more caution to him; but also more expect
strength and protection from him; and in every thought of him will bend your
soul, to fall down, adore, reverence, and fear such a divinity. And in this
meditation will say; Lord depart from me for I am a sinful man: as in the
former; Lord I will follow thee whither soever thou go.

Man's Restitution BY JESUS CHRIST. Jesus Christ sent by the Father a Prophet,
Lawgiver, Apostle, declaring all Gods Will, etc.
GOD, who in the beginning, writ his Laws. 1. Jesus Christ the truth, in the
fullness of time.
in the hearts of all men, ( Romans 2. 14, 15. The Gentiles not having the Law of
Moses yet show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their thoughts
accusing, etc. So Romans 1. 21, 25, 28, 32. Because when they knew God, they
glorified him not as God, v. 21. but changed the truth of God into a lie, v.
25. tho knowing that they, who commit such things, are worthy of death, v. 32.
as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, so God gave them over,
etc. ver. 28) made, besides this, from the beginning, many express revelations
by Prophets Jude 14. in many particulars concerning his service and worship, to
the Church. Therefore find we much of the ceremonial Law practiced before
Moses, Genesis 14, 20. 35, 2. 8, 21. Exodus 24, 5. Genesis 15, 10. compared with Lev.
1, 17. Genesis 9, 4. etc.

But here, much of these Laws by so ill a Register* and in so long time being
more and more defaced and worn out, (for Moses's Law was added because of the
overflowing of transgressions against the Law natural, Gal. 3. 19. till Christ
should come: The effects of which Law Mosaical among the Jews, the rules of
Philosophy (being only the Law of nature revived by the wisest of other
nations) in some inferior degree wrought among the Gentiles) after more than
2000 years, when the Church very numerous was grown into a State, God published
them again unto the world with great solemnity by Moses; and writ them himself
in Tables of stone to last the longer; and, doubtless, in these then, added
many explications, at least to those which formerly were practiced, or enjoined
to Adam, Genesis 4. 3, 4. or Noah, Genesis 9. 1. etc.

But here again, his Laws being neither obeyed so far as understood; nor
understood so far as they obliged; after a long space of his tolerating the
unbelief and imperfection of the veiled Jew 2 Cor. 3. 13, 14, 16. and his
winking at the ignorance and idolatry of the Gentiles, and his suffering them
to go on in their own ways: Act. 17. 30, 14, 16. and he having now sufficiently
educated his Church in the pedagogism of the Law and of Ceremonies, after about
2000 years more, in the full and due time Ephesians. 1. 10. 1 Timothy 2. 6. Heb. 11. 40.
and the worlds mature age Gal. 4. 3. (therefore the first words of our Saviors
preaching are: The time is fulfilled Sent.
Mark. 1. 15. -the Gospel retaining much what the same distance from the
covenant made with Abraham, wherein were included any Proselytes of the
Gentiles, and the promulgation of the Law; as these were from the beginning of
nature, for he does all things in number, weight, measure): He sent his Son
Jesus Christ the greatest and last Prophet, and the Holy one of God, yet more
perfectly and fully to revele and declare to mankind his last, and all, his
will, etc. Mat. 15. 24. Jo. 3. 34. -5. 38.

And Him he then sent into the very middle and 2.
Navil, as it were, of the then known world, and there seated him not at
Jerwsalem, but in Galilee; half (as it were) amongst the Gentiles; to whom the
Church was now to be enlarged, and Salvation to be preached as well as to the
Jews. Tho to the Jews in the first place, see Jo. 4. 40. Sent him at this
time, and to this place; From which time and place, that which he did and
taught, might by the Testimony of many witnesses chosen before of God, Act 10.
41. descend conveniently to all other places and times. This thing being
necessarily to be effected in some determinate age, in some particular Nation
and Country; unless perchance the unreasonableness of our unbelief will have
him for our fuller satisfaction to act over and over again that great work, in
all places; and in each of them too at all times; and that we will not in this
one thing allow to as firm relations, as posterity is capable of, (I mean the
Gospels) that credit, which we so easily yield to the Histories of all other
famous actions and passages of the world.

Which Relations of these four Evangelists, and 3.
three of them ocular witnesses, common and used in the beginnings of
Christianity, are showed to be most true. 1. From the conversion of so many
thousands 1.
to this Faith (which thing cannot be denied) who lived in the time, when these
Scriptures were writ; and in the places, where* these things were pretended to
be acted; where any falfity might have been most easily discovered; especially
in so many famous and public passages related in them, which few could be
ignorant of. As; Herod's murdering the Infants: the darkness at the execution
of Jesus: John Baptists preaching: many of our Saviors and the Apostles
miracles. See 1 Cor. 15. 6. 2 From the prophesies of the old Testament
concerning 2.
the Messiah (to those who allow those writings) exactly agreeing with, and
fulfilled in, the History of Jesus (even as they were interpreted by the
learned Jews before the coming of the Messiah) in so many punctualities of his
life and death; and especially in the time of his coming; which was to be under
the second Temple, Hagg. 2. 7, 9. But this Temple was destroyed by Titus; And
when the Scepter was departed first from the Jewish Nation (for this King was
then to be sent when the others failed;) But this happened first in the time of
Herod, the first stranger King, after both David's and Levi's rule deposed; and
when also the Roman Empire, under whose yoke the Jews were now fallen, was first
perfected and at its height in Augustus; in whose times our Savior came. 3.
From the plain 3.
prophecies contained in these Relations, as Matt. 24. etc. concerning the
perfecution of the Christian profession; the destruction of Jerusalem and
Temple; and dispersion of the Jews; set down in them long before the event. 4.
As likewise from 4.
those heavy curses which the world has seen to fall upon all the enemies of
Christ, and the primitive Christians; as, upon the Jews (the desolation of
which Nation bears witness to this day in all Countries to the truth of the
Gospel); upon Herod the Great; His son Archelaus; Herod the Tetrarch,
Archelaus's brother that beheaded John; Herod Agrippa ( Act. 12, 23.) that
killed James; it being observed by Josephus (a stranger to this cause) that of
Herod's very numerous race within 70 years none were left, but all extinguished
in a most miserable manner; and upon the Roman Emperors, so long as the
persecutions endured i. e. till Constantine's time, most of whom suffered
unhappy ends. 5 From the 5.
then, (by the Heathen confessed) cessation of oracles, (see Plutarch's
treatise of it) and the miraculous propagation of the Christian Doctrine, tho
so severe and opposite to flesh and blood, by such mean and unarmed
instruments, through such sufferings; which shows it to be a work of no less then
a Divine power. And tho another Religion since it, even that of the great
Antichrist, Mahometanism, has also spread much in the world; yet first both 1.
the manner of its growth shows it not to be of God: being both planted at
first and since continued by the sword, always destitute of any true miracles:
(this being not only the practice but the Doctrine of that great Impostour
opposite to Christ's, That men are by war to be compelled to the Faith.) And
also being tempered with much brutish liberty and sensuality indulged to the
flesh, which much easilier enclines men's affections to it. Nova secta ita
tanden se late diffundit, si portam luxuriae and voluptatibus aperiat. And
again; 2. Its growth never equalled 2.
the amplitude of Christianity: nor ever shall so universally overrun it, as
Christianity has, and shall, destroy Heathenism; and also God in all Ages
preserves a place of retreat for his Church, from the face of the Dragon and
of the Beast to whom he gives his power. Apoc. 12. 6, 14. compare 13, 5. Dan.
7, 8. 3 Lastly it never advances farther then 3.
the sword by violence carries it: whereas our Lord 1. by the power of the
spirit; 2. and the Testimony of miracles; and 3. by sufferings instead of Arms,
as in the beginning, so still shall continue to propagate his truth; and goes
on conquering and to conquer Nations remote, whom the sword cannot reach: in
every age some new people voluntarily submitting to his Scepter.

All these, and many more justify sufficiently the. 4.
truth of these Relations. So that though our Savior came but in one appointed
time, yet all times, that did not see it, notwithstanding want not the greatest
reason that can be had from the evidence of History to believe it. And he that
requires more would leave no place for the exercise and merit of Faith: which
otherwise would have been as worthless as that feeling one of St Thomas, which
suffered a reprehension from our Savior. But Gods pleasure it is, as well for
the trial of our inclinations to heavenly things, as for his greater
glorification in our service of him, and advancement of our future reward, to
give grounds of belief sufficient, not coactive and uncontradictable; and to
make us walk only by Faith here, not by sight: that our adherence might be so
much more esteemed, by how much we had less evidence, tho all may have evidence
enough. See Jo. 20. 29. 1 Pet. 1. 8. Else, let us also require, that God should
also show his personal presence amongst us; and when he ministers to our
necessities, do it by Angels visible; and always present to us a prospect of
the Joys of Heaven, as the Devil did to our Savior the glories of this lower
world; and then let him blame us if we do not reverence, trust in, and ferve,
him.

Hither therefore at this time sent; He, in whom 5.
were hid from all eternity all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, Col. 2.
3. was first anointed (as Prophets Anointed.
anciently were, 1 King. 19. 16.) and sealed by the Father to this office Jo.
6. 27. Luke 4. 18, 22. Esai. 11. 2. Act. 10. 38. Act. 4. 27. Anointed with the
holy Ghost and with power; and that visibly at his Baptism, Jo. 1. 33. that all
might know him to be sent (since none unsent may take such honor. Heb. 5. 4.)
Yea filled with the holy Ghost which never man was before him. ( For it pleased
the Father that in him should all fullness dwell. Col. 1. 19. And God gave not
the Spirit by mesure to him, Jo. 3. 34; but according to mesure he gives it to
all men else Ephesians. 4. 7.) see Matt. 3. 16. Luke 3. 5.

Thus furnished for the many offices to which he. 6. A new Lawgiver for the law
moral.
was predestined by the Father, He was sent First as a new Legislator; being
faithful as Moses. Heb. 3. 2. but yet more to be observed, being Master of the
house wherein Moses was a servant. (v. 6.) Therefore Moses, when he should
come, referred them wholly to him Deuteronomy. 18. 15. And in this office of his,
first a new Legislator in some respects as to the law moral.

First to rectify the understanding of the Law, 1. Expounding it.
formerly either falsified, or mutilated: he expounding it in most things more
fully, and in some things also contrary to what had been said of old. It has
been said of old so, but I say unto you, Matt. 5, 6, 7, chapters. Jo. 1. 17,
18. -3. 2. -4. 25.

2. Again, to exact to this Law thus expounded 2. Requiring stricter obedience.
by him a more true, and inward, and full obedience of all men that would be
his Disciples, then ever had been performed before by the strictest Sects of
all the Law-zealots* not to let a title of it pass away (pass away heaven and
earth first) till all the Law be fulfilled. (Matt. 5. 17, 18, 19, 20. 1 Cor. 7.
19. Gal. 2. 17. Jam. 2. 12.)

3. To make to such observers of this Law more 3.
open and manifest promises of the Kingdom of Heaven Heb. 8. 6. and against
the breakers of this Denouncing heavier judgments.
Law, heretofore winked at, and suffered to walk in their own way, etc. to
revele the wrath of God from Heaven (as not the joys of heaven, so neither the
pains of Hell before his coming having been so much talked of) Romans 1. 18.
charging men every where to repent Act. 17. 30. because a day is appointed
wherein he will judge the world. v. 31. Tit. 2. 11, 12, 13. Therefore he came,
says the Baptist, with an axe on his shoulder; with a fan in his hand; to cut
down the fruitless trees; to purge Gods floor of the chaff; and with a fire
made ready to burn them both. Matt. 3. 10. etc. He was laid a stone for
stumbling; and the fall, as well as the rising again, of many in Israel. (Luke
2. 34.) That every soul, that hears not this man, who the last speaks from
Heaven (Heb. 12. 25.) should be destroyed from among the people. Act. 3. 23.
Es. 6. 9, 10, 11. compare with Matt. 13. 14. Esai. 61. 2. and that none should
have any way to escape that turns away from him. He came for judgment, that
they, who will not see, might be made blind Jo. 9. 39. and the last ages,
knowing by him Gods will and not obeying it, should be beaten (as they are)
with more stripes Luke 12. 48. and their sin remain for ever. Jo. 9. 41.

4. He was sent not only the most perfect and exact. 7. Ministering the spirit.
Interpreter of the letter; that Gods law and will might be fully known, and an
exactor of the observance of it in the strictest senses thereof, upon the most
grievous punishments to the disobedient (which is all, hitherto, but a fuller
ministration of condemnation and death,) But, as of the exactest letter, so he
came the minister of the spirit (2 Cor. 3. 6. Jo. 1. 16, 17. Gal. 3. 14. Phil.
4. 13. Ephesians. 1. 23. 1 Cor. 1. 8. Act. 3. 26.) that by the power of this spirit,
the Law, by them that believed, might be fulfilled. (See Romans 8. 3, 4); which
was the ministration of the soul as it were of the law, and of righteousness
and life unto us ( 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8. Gal. 2. 19. (...) compare with v. 17. and
Romans 8. 2. Jam. 2. 12. 1 Cor. 9. 21.) Before, the law was writ in the
conscience only; as the law of Nature for the Gentile Romans 2. 14, 15; or also
more evidently in stone; as the law of Moses for the Jew; to bring forth
knowledge of sin. But by him it was written with the spirit in the heart, to
bring forth obedience to justification. Jer. 32. 40. The other brought in the
spirit of fear, subjecting our inability to the curse of it; but he gave the
spirit of love; out of this love procuring our observance of it 2. Tim. 1. 7.
Romans 8. 15. 1 Timothy 1. 5. 3. Which love keeps it far more perfectly then fear
would: as showing its zeal not only in Negatives (of which is the letter) i. e.
in working no ill Romans 13. 9, 10. but also in the Affirmatives, (not expressed in
the word of the the law) i. e. in doing all good, to all, to the highest
degree. Therefore this love, the greatest of all gifts 1 Cor. 13. is called
Christ's new commandment Jo. 13. 34. -15. 12. 1 Jo. 2. 8. 2 Jo. 5. had only from
the beginning of the Gospel, i. e. from Christ: and belonging only to the sons
thereof; (tho this Gospel has had such sons from the beginning) who are said 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3. to be taught of God, that is by his spirit 1 Jo. 4. 7, 8. 16. as
the spirit also the only Author of love, and which is love, was his new gift,
by which love, he says, his disciples should be discerned from the disciples
of the law. Jo. 13. 35.

By which ministration of the spirit and of love 8.
(the proper fruit thereof) by Christ we now so easily understand and do the
things commanded by the law; that the letter of the law is said to become as
Abrogating the letter.
it were void and useless to us by the coming of the promised seed; and the
Schoolmastership thereof to be outdated by Christ, not because we are now
without law 1 Cor. 9. 21. but because we have it superabundantly written in our
hearts by the spirit; and the works thereof continually brought forth by love,
through the efficacy of the last lawgiver Jesus Christ. 1 Timothy 1. 5, 9. Gal. 5.
23. -3. 19. Romans 8. 15. Therefore called the law of liberty, Jam. 2. 12. This
for the law moral; which, in some sense our Savior is said to abrogate Gal. 3.
25. Col. 2. 14. that is according to the former use thereof, (namely as only
giving knowledge of sin Romans 3. 20. being a letter of condemnation, and working
wrath (Romans 4. 15. 2 Cor. 3. 7, 9.) and keeping us in slavery and bondage Romans
8. 15. Tho this abrogation is done, not by absolving us from any more
observance of it, but by enabling us to keep it; and by making this observance
now also voluntary.

But next for the law Ceremonial; he was sent yet 9. For the law ceremonial.
Cancelling it.
more properly to annual and cancel it; and to appoint new Ceremonies at
pleasure instead of it. He being the substance and body Col. 2. 17. of which it
was a type and shadow; when that which is perfect was come, the imperfect being
to be done away. He was sent therefore to reform or perfect the worship of God,
from those many exterior rites so strict and burdensome (see Act. 15. 10. Heb.
13. 9. Col. 2. 14.) to that of the spirit and of truth. Jo. 4. 23. As also to
reform many liberties and indulgences under the law (see Matt. 5. 31, 34. -19.
8.) Therefore his times by the Apostle are called the times of Reformation Heb.
9. 10. For as he took away hardness of heart by the ministration of the spirit;
so it was correspondent to this, that He should take away all remissions and
abatements of any part of righteousness, which were permitted only because of
such hardheartedness, Matt. 19. 8.

Thus anointed Luke 4. 18. a little before he began 10.
to preach, by the Father, and publicly proclaimed 2 An Apostle of the Gospel.
also by a voice from Heaven to be the son of God at the solemn time of John's
ministration of Baptism Act. 10. 37. who, as likewise all the people, then
called out into the wilderness unto him, by this unction of the spirit, the
third Person in the descent of a Dove, and the testimony of the first person in
the descent of a voice from Him, (the greatest appearance of the sacred Trinity
that has been upon earth) were to know and discern him, whom the Father had
ordained, to be the light of the world baptizing with the holy Ghost. And of
whose coming John was sent before to give them notice Jo. 1. 33. Anointed thus
with the Holy Ghost and with power Act. 10. 38. Jo. 3. 34. He was, in the next
place, sent from God as an Apostle Heb. 3. 1. of the Christian profession; or
of the Gospel. To whom God committed first, and so he to others the word of
reconciliation 2 Cor. 5. 19. In which respect he is called the great Shepherd
or Pastor by St Paul Heb. 13. 20. Pastor and Bishop of our souls by St Peter 1
Pet. 2. 25. (...) Jo. 13. 13. (...) Romans 15. 8.

In which ministry, he was not only to expound. 11. Preaching it
the old, (spoken of before); but also to deliver some new, messages from the
Father; To bring life and immortality to light through his Gospel 2 Timothy 1. 10; to
revele the great mystery of salvation, which God had decreed from all Eternity,
and shadowed under types to all former ages; but yet (for the open
manifestation of it) kept secret since the beginning of the world Romans 16. 25.
and hid from former generations Col. 1. 26. till this time, (notwithstanding so
much longing after it of so many Prophets and Righteous men, yea and of the
Angels themselves. (See Matt. 13. 17. 1 Pet. 1. 10. 11. Ephesians. 3. 9. Matt. 11.
11. 1 Cor. 2. 9.) When the Son, who only knew the Father, was sent out of his
bosom to declare him Jo. 1. 18. Heb. 1. 1. Matt. 11. 27. Esai. 11. 3. Col. 2.
3. to preach the Gospel to the poor, deliverance to the captives, the
acceptable year of the Lord Luke 4. 18, 19. The time of his good will toward
men; to preach peace Act. 10. 36. and salvation, and remission of sin (for
which Baptism was then also instituted): and the fulfilling of the promise of
God to the Jew, that was made unto their fathers, but likewise of his new mercy
to the Gentiles, that the Gentiles too should glorify God for his mercy Romans
15. 8, 9. And all this to be performed to the world through himself that taught
it: for, as he was the text and subject that was preached of, so also was he
the preacher Ps. 2. 7. -40. 9, 10. Jo. 14. 6. and none could see that light,
but by the light of it: which thought it much stumbled the Jews, that he should
bear record of himself; and He as the truth preach himself as the life Jo. 8.
13. yet both the witness of John, besides that of all the Prophets, and of his
Father from Heaven at his Baptism, etc. and that of his miracles; (all which he
quoted to them to justify his Commission,) were abundantly satisfactory.

And, as this Apostle came to preach the Gospel,. 12. Remitting sins; giving
the Holy Ghost; admitting into the kingdom of Heaven.
so received he power, to remit, and absolve from sin Matt. 9. 2, 6, 11. and
that here on earth as man, see v. 8. and, as Priest Heb. 8. 6; to justify the
ungodly Romans 4. 5. Act. 5. 31; and to make sons of God Jo. 1. 12. and admit
into the Church and the kingdom of Heaven, by the new ceremony of Baptism
(which he did ordinarily by his Disciples Jo. 4. 2; but yet some conjecture
from the practice Act. 19. 5. Jo. 3. 22. that he himself first baptized some of
his Disciples at least; and so accordingly afterward he ministered the
Eucharist). To admit I say into the Church all those, who repented i. e.
confessed their sins, and promised amendment of life. Matt. 3. 8. And who
believed in him, that he was the Son of God Act. 8. 37. -19. 4. Jo. 3. 18. and
in his word, that it was truth, and he the last teacher sent from God, etc. and
who rejected not the counsel of God sent to them by him Luke 7. 30. Jo. 5. 24.
-8. 31. -12. 48. Lastly to give the holy Ghost Jo* 20. 22. Act. 2. 33, 38. Ephesians.
4. 7. 2 Cor. 3. 8. by which to seal his converts unto glory. In which respect
also he is said to give eternal life to as many as receive him Jo. 17. 3. and
to have the key of David, as the chief Oeconomist and officer in that family,
opening and shuting as, and to whom, he pleased, Rev. 3. 7. Esai. 22. 22. Rev.
1. 18. and all judgment to be committed unto him. Jo. 5. 22. Christus, ut homo,
remittit peccata, dat spiritum sanctum, vitam aeternam, etc. potestate tantum
communicata and delegata, sed modo excellentiori quam ministris ejus concessum
est. Ut homo ad has actiones concurrit tantum instrumentaliter and meritorie,
non efficienter; sed tamen ut instrumentum efficienti conjunctum and singular;
non separatum and commune, qualia sunt instrumenta Apostoli, and Prophetae. So
the Schoolmen. And in all this at first he became the Minister of the
Circumcision only, i. e. of the Jews Romans 15. 8. Act. 10. 36. (and, according
to his own commission, for a certain time, he limited his Disciples Matt. 10.
5, 6.) and began there also in Galilee amongst the meaner sort of the people,
and remote from the chief City the least to provoke the envy of those in power
till the appointed time of his passion approached, and preached here mostwhat
in parables; for so it pleased God, that till his sufferings were accomplished,
the peoples ignorance should not be quite dispelled, and that this light should
rise upon the world by degrees, and not all at once Matt. 13. 11. 1 Cor. 2. 8.
But when the time drew near of his offering up, Jo. 7. 8. He preached more
frequently in Jerusalem, and in the Temple (tho usually not lodging in the City
Jo. 8. 1. Lu. 21. 37.) and there at the Feasts of the greatest resort, and
professed more clearly and openly who he was, and did his greatest Miracles Jo.
11. and accordingly multiplied exceedingly his Disciples and followers Jo. 12.
19. Upon which the rage of his enemies now heightened to extremity, and after
three years preaching Lu. 13. 7. and the days of his Ministry accomplished, in
the last place he laid down his life, and died a Martyr for the Truth he had
taught. 1 Timothy 6. 13. Rev. 1. 5. -3. 14. (...).

Now, after his resurrection from the Dead by the. 13.
Divine power, in Justification also of the truth of doctrine, He being to
return to God from whence he came, and the same truth being necessary to be
preached, sins remitted, Sacraments administered, the Holy Ghost conferred, etc.
to the end of the world, to one Country after another; and, in them, to one
generation after another; the last thing Before his departure ordaining others.
he did here on Earth was the ordaining some others for these offices in his

these he gave power to Baptize, i. e. admit into the Church those they saw fit;
which implies their power also to refuse the unfit, (see Act. 10. 47, 48. the
Apostle ordering and others ministering Baptism). And this again infers power to
exclude out of the Church the backsliding, and those not observing the
conditions upon which they were admitted. To these he gave power to preach, and
to declare to the world all the counsel of God, which he had manifested to
them, and to be Ambassadors to men about their reconciliation to God for
Christ, and in his stead, 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19, 20. Act. 20. 27. 2 Cor. 10. 8. Gal.

And it is not to be past by unobserved that our. 18.
Savior delegated this his Authority to others, not with a parity unto all,
but with a superiority of some above the rest; who, as they gave license of
some ministrations to others found qualified for them, See Act. 10. 48. so they
retained some other ministrations to themselves. For we find laying on of
hands, (which is named, Heb. 6. 2. amongst the principles of the doctrine of
Christ, [both that at, or after, Baptism, used to all for receiving the more
extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost, from whence the custom since of
Confirmation by the Bishop, and that which was used in ordaining Presbyters and
setting men apart for the Ministry of the Gospel. This imposition of hands
being a more solemn intercession for them, and a powerful recommendation of
them to the grace of God, for the work which they are called to, and are to
fulfil] See Act. 13. 3. comp. with 14. 26. See St Paul himself receiving the
first Act. 9. 17. the second Act. 13. 3.) we find I say this imposition of
hands, or power of Ordination and Confirmation to be appropriated to the
Apostles and Apostolical men, not common to all. See Act. 6. 6. -8. 17 -19. 6.
-20. 28. -13. 3. Ephesians. 1. 13. 1 Timothy 5. 22. Tit. 1. 5. For this cause left I

permitted to them alone, but as assistants to Titus. See 1 Timothy 4. 14. comp.
with 2 Timothy 1. 6; as also a consent and approbation, or also nomination or
election of persons, whom they thought fitting, was permitted to the Christian
Assemblies, and the whole Church. Act. 6. 3. comp. with 6. 2 Cor. 8. 19. (tho

with the Apostles (as some may think that there was no need of continuing such
a selected Body of Teachers after Christianity planted, and four Gospels, and
so many Epistles written, yet what would not the same men give for such an
Apostle at this day as could decide so many controversies which are in
Religion, whilst they say they need them not?) But he, who lives for ever and
has the keys, etc. Rev. 1. 18. and who ascended from hence on high to receive
these very gifts for, and to bestow then on, men Ephesians. 4. 7, 8. continues for
ever also this office of ordination, by his Servants laying on their hands, and
his own breathing upon, and giving the spirit unto them, to those that have
succeeded the Apostles and that shall succeed to the end of the world.
Therefore as he gave the Apostles, so it is said also he gave the Pastors and
Teachers (according to the measure of the gift he thought fit) that were made
by the Apostles Ephesians. 4. 11, 8. Romans 10. 15. 2 Timothy 1. 14. Matt. 23. 24. And

spirit, remitting sins, etc. never any man might take to himself, but only
give, what he first received. If he do otherwise, he is in a worse condition
then Simon, who at least would have bought the giving it.) Sent by God I say,
else is their preaching to no purpose, the effect of which for ever consists,
not in the wisdom of men, which works contrary to it, as thought foolishness;
but in the power of God 1 Cor. 2. 5. see 1 Cor. 12. 3. Matt. 16. 17. 1 Jo. 4.

preserving the Commandment that was committed unto them without spot 1 Timothy 6.

coming of the Lord Jesus. Tit. 1. 5. 1 Timothy 5. 22. -1. 3. -6. 14. Such
Ecclesiastical government was then ordered by them in Ephesus and in Crete,
etc. Therefore we may presume the same was established every where else; first
both because of the Apostles special endeavor of uniformity in Churches 1 Cor.
4. 17. -7. 17. -11. 16. Secondly, and because we find in the Church History the
same government de facto to have been in all the rest, as it was in that of
Ephesus, where Timothy resided; and in Crete, where Titus; and also find every
where the like Catalogues of their Bishops; and so, in the Revel. the Angel of
Ephesus the Church, wherein Timothy was placed by St Paul, no way differing
from, or more single then, the rest of other Churches. Thirdly, and again
because we find such Government without the mention of any opposition; (which
must needs have been in the purity and fresh memory of those times, upon any
innovation; especially so universal; and in this case of some men's usurping
preeminence, sooner then in any other:) without the mention I say of any
opposition either of the inferior Clergy, or of the superior Apostle; St John,
living some time after the settlement of these Episcopal Governments. The
continuation of which Government so uninterruptedly ever since, as well in the
most adverse, as the most prosperous, times of the Church, is the greatest
argument that can be: that it has our Lords protection; and that it was his
first institution; and that it shall continue yet longer, even till the end.

this end into the world to bear witness (to the uttermost) unto the truth Jo.
18. 37. and therefore called the faithful Martyr Rev. 1. 5, Where note; that as
our Lord used great silence as to the vindicating of his innocence before
persons self-convinced, and (as he told them, Luke 22. 68.) that would upon no
account absolve him; yet no way to betray the Truth: Which upon all occasions
he most freely confessed, tho upon this his Confession they grounded, and he
foreknew it, the taking away of his life. Thus, on Thursday night in the Garden
he went forth, and met those who sought for him Jo. 18. 4. and freely told them
who He was without their need of a Judas to disclose him; and, when they were
startled and recoiled upon it, a second time he told them it. Jo. 18. 8.
Brought before the High Priest and Council, and there examined concerning his
Doctrine, he told them, he had ever publicly declared it in their Synagogues,
in the Temple, and that they could not want witnesses enough, if any thing were
condemnable therein. Jo. 18. 20. When asked again more particularly (not to
inform their Faith, as he well knew Luke 22. 68. but, as they used formerly, to
entrap him for his life,) whether he was the Messiah? Whether the Son of God?
Matt. 26. 64. Mark. 14. 61. He now referred them not to witnesses, nor asked
them a counter-question, but answered plainly; I am Mark. 14. 62. and
foreseeing that day of retribution, that would be so terrible to them, when he
should sit on the Throne, and they stand trembling at his Bar, in great
compassion adds further, that [whatever he then appeared] nevertheless they
should see him hereafter sitting [as David had foretold Psalm. 109. 1.] on the
right hand of the power of God and coming in the Clouds of Heaven [to judge the
world, and, among the rest, them, his Judges;] showing also in this, that he
retained a magnanimity suitable to his person, and that he kept his eye fixed on
the future glory in the midst of these his Humiliations. Upon this his
confession, which they thought sufficient to dispatch him, being brought by
them before Pilat the Judge to receive his sentence; and there, upon their
accusation, asked again; whether he was the King of the Jews? which was a Title
equivalent to the Messiah, or Christ, but somewhat more odious, they conceived,
to a Roman Governor: Here our Lord both freely professed to him, that he was
so: Matt. 27. 11. and also informed Him, to prevent mistakes, of what nature
his kingdom was; Viz. that it contained nothing in it prejudicial to any
terrence or temporal Monarchy; as clearly appeared, in that he had no humane
forces or Servants to fight for Him that he should not have been delivered into
the hands of the Jews, i. e. the chief Priests, Scribes and Pharisees. Jo. 18.
36. Yet asked by him a second time; whether, ^ho his Kingdom not of this world,
yet he was a King? He again professed it; and told him, that to this end he was
born and for this cause came into this world [for this end descended from
Heaven and was Incarnate,] to bear witness to the Truth. Jo. 17. 37. After
which Pilat, upon his wonderful silence and not pleading for Himself, nor
vouchsafing further to acquaint him with his divine Originals Matt. 27. 14. Jo.
19. 9. minding him before whom he stood and that he had the power in his hands
to absolve or condemn Him (which shows that our Lord stood before him in the
midst of such heavy and false accusations, saying that he made a Sedition in
Galilee; forbad paying tribute to Caesar; said he would destroy the Temple made
with hands, and raise another made without hands, etc. Luke 23. 5. Luke 23. 2.
Mark. 14. 58. as one altogether unmoved and as it were unconcerned therein) our
Lord freely admonished him of the Original of his power, which indeed was
Himself, that he could have no power against Him except what was given him from
above, Jo. 19. 11. i. e. from Himself King of Kings, by whom, God his Father
governs the world; and therefore that their sin was the more intolerable, who
had thus bound and delivered him up to be judged by those his Officers, who
from Him hold their power, and by whom they Rule. Jo. 19. 11. Thus (as the
Apostle 1 Timothy 6. 15.) he witnessed before Pilat a good and free Confession,
and that with so much power and Majesty, as that the Governor seems to have
been in some manner persuaded of the truth of what he said; and became much
afraid; Jo. 19. 8, 9. and would have questioned further with him concerning
his Divine Original; but that this meek Lamb of God having said what was
sufficient, and intent upon his sufferings, thought fit to put no obstruction
thereto by a further declaration to this Gentile of his Parentage. Jo. 19. 9.
But so much was already said, as that the Governor both professed his
Innocence, and washed his hands, Matt. 27. 24, 25. and sought all means to
release Him, Jo. 19. 12. even by exercisiing some cruelties on him himself to
have preserved him from greater, Jo. 19. 1, 4. and after this when out of the
surprisal of a contrary fear, he most unworthily and cowardly pronounced
sentence upon him, or rather yielded him up to the sentence of the Jews: Matt.
27. 24. Mark 15, 15. Luke 23. 24. Yet He resolutely maintained his Title of a
King, nor would upon any their solicitation change it. Answering them only Quod
scripsi, scripsi. Jo. 19. 21. etc.

And God the Father likewise confirmed both this. 23.
his Office and his Doctrine, first by (several times) speaking from Heaven:
thrice by Thunder; these voices coming for our sakes. Jo. 12. 30. And by
charging the people immediately by himself to hearken unto him. This is, etc.

power. Romans 1. 4. By this resuscitation of him by the Spirit of the Father was

Pet. 2. 23. who when he was reviled he reviled not again; when he suffered he
threatened not. But when they smote him on the right cheek he turned to them the
other also. Matt. 27. 29. When they took away his Coat he let them take away
Cloak also, Jo. 19. 23. etc. tho he could have commanded Myriads of Angels for
his assistance yet, as a Lamb dumb before the Shearer, so He opened not his
mouth. Matt. 27. 14. According to Matt. 5. 44. He suffered death it self for
his enemies, that he might show the greatest love that could be to them; He
prayed for those that despitefully used him. Father forgive them Luke 23. 34.
He returned good for evil continually; and especially in that eminent example
of restoring his ear to the High Priests Servant. According to Matt. 6. 3. In
so often hiding his Miracles, he endeavored, that his left hand might not
know, what his right hand did, see Mark 1. 44. Matt. 17. 9. Luke 9. 21. Mark 7.
36. So when he grew famous in Judea, and preferred before the Baptist, either
not to prejudice Joh^s Ministry, or to avoid vain popular concourse and
applause, he removed presently out of the Country. See Jo. 4. 1, 3. According
to Matt. 19. 21, 24. Luke 12. 31, 33. He made an election of the state of
poverty, leaving all his friends for the service of God; travailing up and down
the Country on foot see Jo. 4. 6. Receiving alms from others Luke 8. 3. and
enjoining the same to his Disciples Matt. 10. 9. the Labourer being worthy of
his meat from those he labors for, verse. 10. According to Matt. 6. 6. he hid
his Devotions with Wildernesses, Mountains, Nights, Luke 5. 16. -6. 12.
According to Matt. 5. 29. Luke 14. 26. He forsook his reputed Father, and his
Mother, and Kindred when they might have hindered him in his Service to God. See
Luke 2. 48. Matt. 12. 47, 48. According to his Doctrine Matt. 6. 25. etc. He
laid up no treasure upon earth: took no thought for his life or for the morrow;
not so much as for his next nights lodging, not having many times where to lay
his head Matt. 8. 20. But all these things were by Gods providence, by some
that followed him, ordinarily, added unto him Luke 8. 3. According to his
Doctrine Matt. 20. 26. He made himself inferior to the lowest of his inferiors,
even to the Servant that he then knew would betray his life; even to the
stooping to wash and wipe their feet. Jo. 13. 15; And did this for this very
reason; to give them a good example. The chief among you let him be your
servant. Even as the Son of Man, etc. Matt. 20. 28. So in his very triumph when
all saluted him King; and covered his way with garments, his lowliness made
choice of an Ass to carry him, a little young Ass Matt. 21. 5. to show
humility. According to his Doctrine Matt. 6. 33. He prosecuted all
Righteousness with such zeal and diligence that he scarce allowed himself time
to eat on the day time, for doing good to men. See Jo. 4. 31, 34. Mark. 6. 3.
31. or to sleep in the night, for following his Devotions to God Mark. 1. 35.
Luke 6. 12. Lastly, as the Apostle observed, Christ pleased not himself Romans
15. 3. but sought the good of others; and this for our learning. Ver. 4.

And as for the Moral, so for the Ceremonial law:. 2. Ceremonial
very punctual he was in all obedience, tho useless and non-significant in him,
as it related to remission of sin, etc. yet coming (at best) in the likeness of
sinful flesh Romans 8. 3. he was circumcised; was baptized with the Ceremony of
the descent of the Holy Ghost; celebrated the Passover, the Eucharist; tho
always full of the Holy Ghost, and free from sin, he needed no cleansings nor
expiations signified by the one; nor had this Redeemer received any redemption
signified by the other. Kept the solemn Feasts and the Sabbath (whatever they
falsely alleged against him) exactly, tho he was absolute Lord of it Matt. 12.
8. was obedient to every human ordinance; To John the Baptist wondering at this
his humility; to his Parents; to his Governors; tho he the Creator of them, and
Governor at that very time of all things, to whom all things in Heaven and
Earth ought to bow: paid tribute patiently, tho free, least the standing on his
right might be any way offensive Matt. 17. 27. Fasted 40 days together; tho his
flesh was constantly obedient to the spirit, to show to others that excellent
way of conquering temptation: sought by prayer, what he might command Luke 22.
32. prayed whole nights together, tho he knew his Father heard him always Jo.
11. 42; to teach us by his example the lesson Luke 18. 1. suffered such anguish
and affliction for our sins in the Garden, to teach us what we ought to
practice for them our selves in repentance. For thus it became him to fulfill
all that, being our Leader, the doing of which was necessary righteousness and
obedience in his followers Matt. 3. 15.

Thus God sent his Son to be an Example to us, 3. 2 In all sufferings for
righteousness sake.
and a forerunner in all holy obedience to his commands. God again decreeing
that all that yield this obedience shall in this world suffer persecution, 2 Timothy 3. 12. that they that receive good things hereafter shall now receive
evil. Luke 16. 15. Luke 6. 21, 24. that they that shall laugh hereafter shall
now mourn, as they also that laugh now shall mourn hereafter. (And indeed it
cannot otherwise be, as long as there are more evil men then good, nor this to
have more men evil be otherwise; as long as men have free will to evil, which
is any deviation whether in excess or defect from good; and therefore ( bonum
being unum, and malum multiplex) much easier then good: nor again can this be
otherwise, i. e. that men should not have free will; unless we, wiser then God,
would have the world new molded without containing any free-willagent in it,
and what is this but having in it a great imperfection and defect.) That there
may be a vicissitude in all things, sent his Son to be a pattern to the rest of
his Servants of all sufferings: For it became him, (says the Apostle) by whom,
and for whom are all things, in his sacred purpose of bringing many Sons through
mortality and affliction unto glory, to make also the Captain of their
Salvation perfect through sufferings. Heb. 2. 10. That so he also might first
sound the depths of human miseries; and being just of our pitch, might wade
before us through them all, and show them easily passable; that we might follow
him with cheerfulness and courage, and not expostulate with the Almighty, if
here perchance he uses us no better (yet whom does he not so?) then he did his
only Son; his Son in whom he was always so well pleased Matt. 3. 17. that
never sinned against him. And thus in obedience to his Father first clothed
with all the (innocent) infirmities of our nature, and indulging himself none
of the contents thereof: Romans 15. 3. But exercising a perfect abnegation of
himself, and of his own will (tho he had also his natural affections after
things agreeing to it. See 1 Jo. 5. 30. Matt. 26. 39. In all things made Heb.
2. 17. and tempted Heb. 2. 18. like unto his Brethren; undergoing temptations
from Satan more then once Luke 4. 13. and so far as to be carried up and down
by him Matt. 4. 5. and that unclean spirit the most cursed of all the creatures
of God to be suffered to take his only Son in his arms. From the world; having
all the glory of it presented to him Matt. 4. 9. a Kingdom offered him Jo. 6.
15. From the often necessities and natural inclinations of the flesh; as may be
sufficiently discovered in that passionate sad, blood-sweating, prayer, (many
times iterated) to be freed from death which he so resignedly concluded; with
not my will, but thine be done) for our example, as if himself would have
learnt patience by the things which he suffered. Heb. 5. 8. He voluntarily
became of no reputation Phil. 2. 7; A man of sorrows Esai. 53. 3. put himself
in the worst condition of life; that those in the worst condition may neither
complain, nor boast, that their sufferings are gone below the Son of God; and
then ended it in the most ignominious death; upon a Gibbet; naked among
thieves; a death inflicted on no free man; particularly cursed by God. Gal. 3.
13. Deuteronomy. 21. 23. commanded and executed under the Law only in the most horrid
crimes, (as in the Israelites idolatry with Moab. The perjured murders of
Saul: the Kings of the cursed Canaanites) to appease Gods extraordinary wrath,
where Famine or Plague broke out upon the people: therefore is it styled
hanging them up before the Lord. And so ^oathsome a spectacle was enjoined
again to be taken down and buried the same day (as our Savior was) as it were
out of his sight. See Deuteronomy. 21. 22. Numb. 25. 4. Josh. 10. 26. 2 Samuel 21. 6.
This such a death he underwent (despising the shame Heb. 12. 2.) that in the
greatest ignominy of their end also, all his Sons might see before them a
Divine precedent. And suffered being perfectly innocent that none hereafter
might think much to suffer for innocence, all being some other way personally
guilty. For our example he became lowly and meek, and stooped his neck unto the
yoke that we might learn of him to be so too: Mat. 11. 29. and put his shoulder
under the heaviest cross that ever man bare; that we might take up our lighter
ones and follow him. Luke 9. And thus he suffered, and thus he dyed not only
before us, but also for us, first; that his love, says the Apostle, might
constrain us 2 Cor. 5. 13. by his example so to suffer and to die again, if need
be, for him; or also for one another. 2 Cor. 12. 15. and, that as he died for
sin, so we might die to it. Romans 6. 6.

3. Thus our Savior was made uuto us a pattern. 4. 2 In receiving the reward.
of sufferings. Next God sent his Son, to be to us in his resurrection from
this death, and reception into glory; a pattern of the reward promised to
obedience, life eternal. An example as of performing all the obedience active
and passive, God by him required of us, so of receiving the reward, God by him
promised to us. That so not only the promise of a greater reward then was
revealed to the world formerly (at least so expressly) might more encourage us
to weldoing; but also the seeing of that reward bestowed upon the obedient
might yet excite us more, then the promise, whilst we being yet in the combat
behold another, that used only the same weapons, against the same enemies, in
the same infirmities, crowned with victory; and look unto one, who running the
same race, for the joy also that was set before him, enduring the Cross, and
despising the shame, now for it is set down at the right hand of the Throne of
God; whilst, considering him that endured such contradiction, etc. now for it
exalted above all gainsaying, we may not be wearied nor faint in our minds Heb.
12. 1, 2, 3. Therefore it was necessary that the Prophet that taught a
resurrection should die to show us an example of deliverance from death; And it
was necessary that God should raise again this just person from the dead, and
cause him to reign to assure us by this example that whoever suffers with, i.
e. like, Him, shall also reign together with him, Romans 8. 17. and that we
professing to be dead with him to sin, should now likewise walk with him in
newness of life Romans 4. 6. For Christ's exaltation also was bestowed on him for
his obedience. See Heb. 2. 9. Phil. 1. 8, 9. Heb 1. 9. Rev. 3. 21. -5. 12.

And as the natural Son came thus to be a pattern to us, so must all the
adopted Sons of God be a transcript and copy of him. As if we obey and suffer
as he, we shall reign as he; so if we will reign as he, we must suffer and obey
as he; tho not so much as he, yet in such manner as he. For also neither shall
we reign in such eminence as He. It is very well if the Servant be as his Lord
Matt. 10. 25. [not above Him.] And he that abides in Christ ought himself also
to walk even as he also walked. 1 Jo. 2. 6. And that none may justly pretend
inability so to walk, I mean to some measure of perfection, tho not to an equal
with his (for neither has any had an equal measure of the Spirit to his) he
has purchased from his Father the Derivation of the same Spirit on us which
enabled himself. Which holy Spirit is conferred, and from time to time renewed
and increased by the Sacraments (i. e. non ponentibus obicem, to the not
wilfully and obstinatly unworthy receivers thereof) and which Spirit always
abides in us (unless by great sins, such as we are perpetually enabled to
avoid, it happen to be expelled) and who so obeys the natural motions
thereof, must as necessarily operate the work of Christ, the second Adam as he
that abides still in the former state of the flesh must needs do the works of
the first. For as what is born of Flesh is Flesh, so what is born of Spirit is
Spirit: and the same Spirit in the man Jesus and us, guided that man no
otherwise than us; and now does guide us, as then Him.

mankind made at the Creation and called the Law of Nature, and again
solemnized at Mount Sinai to that Nation, to which he had confined his Church
at the delivery of the law of Moses, who was then the Mediator that passed
between God and man, see Exodus 14. mentioned Heb. 8. 9. being found
unprofitable Heb. 8. 7, 13. Man not continuing in the promised observance of
it; for indeed the promulgation of the law was effectual to make him more
conscious of his sin, but not to make him more observant of his duty, see Romans
7. 6. yet served it well to other Gods purposes intended by it. Gal. 19, 24.
and accordingly God not regarding the promised protection of him; As is
plainliest expressed Heb. 8. 9. And thus the two parties standing at the
greatest enmity, Man being alienated says the Apostle, and an enemy in his
mind by wicked works Col. 1. 21. and God again thus provoked, giving him up.
Romans 1. 28. as a child of wrath to be a slave to sin, to death, to Satan. Heb.
2. 14, 25. Yet so infinite in his mercy was God; so loved he the world Jo. 3.
16. whilst it was yet without strength; Romans 5. 6. yet enemy verse. 10. yet
sinner verse. 8. being not willing that his creature should thus perish 2 Pet.
3. 9. That he was pleased once more to reconcile it to himself; and to enter
into a new, and the last, covenant with man; and so growing still upon the
world were his mercies, that this covenant should be so far better then the
former, that in comparison thereof the other is styled faulty, and not good,
etc. Heb. 8. Now no covenant can be made between Him and mankind without a
Mediator, a person to go betwixt 1 Timothy 2. 5. Jo. 14. 6. to declare Gods
gracious pleasure unto us: and to procure and receive from us, and offer our
submission unto God 2 Cor. 5. 20. See the manner of this; Exodus 24. As
therefore Moses was of the old Gal. 3. 19. so Jesus Christ was sent the
Mediator of the new. The substance of which Covenant you may read Heb. 8. 10.
relating to Jer. 31. 32. and see the same Ezekiel. 36. 25. and every where in the
Gospels and in the Acts. [ Repent and be baptized for the remission of Sins,
and bring forth fruits worthy of repentance] where there is remission
covenanted on Gods part, and future obedience on ours.

And it was first on Gods part that he would give. 2.
a free remission of all sins past. [ Their sins and their iniquities will I
remember no more, Heb. 8. 12. 2 Cor. 5. 19.] and for the future by giving them
plentifully of his Spirit Jo. 1. 17. Act. 2. 17. Jo. 14. 26. would write his
laws not in tables of Stone, or of the conscience only as formerly, but in
their hearts; so that every one should now know the Lord, verse. 10, 11. and be
also enabled by the Spirit to serve him; and that not out of fear but love; His
Laws too now (I mean after the Covenant of grace completed upon our Saviors
Incarnation. For else the same Covenant was under the time of the Law and
before them from the beginning;) only such as are Spiritual, not Carnal: so
called Heb. 7. 16. -9. 10. natural and grounded on reason and primitive honesty
(not arbitrary and typical Laws) purged from legal Ceremony Col. 2. 14, 17.
Lastly; that he would be their gracious God Heb. 8. 10. and they should be a

and man, so between the Jew and the Gentile, pulling down the wall which before
parted their Courts in the Temple, the outer being for the Gentiles. See Ephesians.

on better promises. He is the Mediator of a better Covenant which was
established on better promises Heb. 8. 6. The heavenly country and reward of
eternal life; being not so clearly at least proposed before our Saviors coming,
as the typical felicities of the earthly Canaan.

But that he required also on man's counter part; That hating and forsaking our
former courses we should hereafter (being so much enabled by grace; so much to
be rewarded by eternal glory; freed from the unsupportable burden of
Ceremonials) yield obedience to his Laws, as explained by his Son, in a more
strict manner then had been performed by former ages: Lastly, that as he would
be our gracious God, so we should be his obedient people. Heb. 8. 10. Else that
there were prepared pa es praemio p^nae. And as his exceeding favors were now
revealed to obedience, even life eternal; so his exceeding wrath against all
impiety, even fire unquenchable Matt. 3. 7, 10, 12. This I say is required on
man's part. For in this new Covenant (which is done in their baptism by
Sponsors, and afterward ratified in Confirmation by themselves.) Men engage
something as well as God, according to the manner of that former Exodus 24. 3.
where the people engaged with one voice; All the words, etc. will we do. Now
Jesus it was that brought this Gospel this blessed tidings from his Father,
that was the Sponsor; the undertaker, the Surety from God of a better
Testament. Heb. 7. 22. He the person whom the Lord appointed to preach this
good tidings unto the meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty,
to open prisons, to comfort all that mourn, to proclaim the acceptable year of
the Lord; (but also the day of vengeance to the wicked. Esai. 6. 1.) He by whom
God commended his love toward us, whilst we were yet sinners Romans 5. by whom we
have now received the atonement with God verse. 11. Romans 5. 1. by whom it
pleased the Father to reconcile all things unto Himself Col. 1. 20. 2 Cor. 5.

beseeching us to be reconciled also to him 2 Cor. 5. 20.

left others to do the same office and to beseech men the same thing from
generation to generation in his stead. Verse. 10. And by baptism washing away
their sins past, to take every ones promise of obedience and fidelity, and so
admit them into this Covenant. Baptism being the Sacrament which now answers to
Circumcision, (which was the Sacrament to the believers under the Law, not of
the first Covenant of works (as the Jews misconceived it) but of the second of
Righteousness by Faith, which came by Christ Romans 4. 11. Gal. 3. 17. In which
every single person by Sponsors at the Font (if baptized in Infancy) afterward
in Confirmation by himself gives his particular assent to the Covenant: and by
this is made partaker of the new promises in it: therefore says the Apostle
Act. 1. 33. Repent and be baptized, etc. for the promise is to you and to your
children; and therefore a good conscience (in obeying Gods commands) answering
our Covenant made in Baptism to do so, called (...) in the vulgar,
Interrogatio, (because then interrogatories are proposed about it, and engaged
for by the baptizand) is said to save us. 1 Pet. 3. 21.

Christ then being the Mediator of a Covenant; 5. The blood of this ^ovenant.
and no solemn Covenant being made without shedding of blood, Zech. 9. 11. see
Ps. 50. 5. Those that have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice. See Exodus 24.
Genesis 15. Heb. 9. 15, 18. etc. This blood laying a solemn engagement and
obligation on both the parties for performance of promises. (Therefore Genesis 15.
10, in Gods covenanting with Abraham, were the Beasts divided into two halfs,
God passing between them: and Exodus 24. In Gods covenanting with Israel, the
blood divided and half sprinkled on the Altar on Gods part, and half on the
people:) beside that in a Covenant of this kind especially between a just Lord
and rebellious Subjects, where one part had so highly offended, this blood
sprinkled upon them signified a remission (which is never done without blood
Heb. 9. 22.) Hence no hearty agreement and reconciliation between two formerly
differing parties being possible without remission of all former offenses; and
again no remission of former offenses from the just God being without sacrifice
or satisfaction; neither was therefore any Covenant without sacrifice. And the
eating of such a sacrifice given to ^od (being as it were an admittance unto
Gods Table, and Viands; and to have Communion with him, see Exodus 24. 5, 11. 1
Cor. 10. 16. etc. 21. signified a reentrance into his favor: Thus; sacrifice,
shedding and sprinkling of blood I say, being required at the solemnity of a
Covenant (which Ancient ceremonies were all only forcadumbrations and types of
this we now speak of; and not it fashioned according to what the former were,
but they according to what it should be.) It pleased God to give and to confirm
likewise and ratify this last Covenant unto us in the blood of his Son: Romans
5. 10. with whose blood we were sprinkled; this being the infinitely highest
expression of his renewed love to mankind; for what greater signification had
Abraham of his love to God, his Friend, then to offer his only Son? and the
same we see God now requited to the children of Abraham; tho these his enemies
here giving really, what he would not of Abraham really accept; making this
blood a perpetual witness and assurance of his remitting all those
transgressions now, which still remained under the former covenant Heb. 9. 15.
and an everlasting obligation of him to performance of his promises.

But yet further this being not only a Covenant. 6. The Death ratifying this
Testament.
but a Testament: both because it was Gods last will, that he has enjoined
unto man to observe, Heb. 8. 8, 10. none other being to come after it; and
being in this last will also, a legacying and conveyance to us, from the Son,
of that heavenly inheritance which from his Father by birthright from all
eternity was his; and no such Testament standing in force, but from the death
(first) of the Testator; whom living, perhaps it might be changed, but after
death never can. Heb. 9. 17. Hence, to make all sure to us every way; our
Savior the Testator suffered death. And for these reasons is the Gospel called
so often the new Testament in his blood Luke 22. 20. and his blood styled the
blood of the Covenant Heb. 10. 29. Zech. 9. 11. That we are said now to be come
from Mount Sinai and to Jesus the Mediator of the new Covenant: and to the
blood of sprinkling that speaks better things then Abels; for that spoke
revenge, but this remission; and his blood said to witness the remission of our
sins, etc. 1 Jo. 5. 8. Heb. 12. 13. Hence we are called Elect through the
sprinkling upon us of the blood of Jesus Christ. 1 Pet. 1. 2. Hence is he said
to have made peace through the blood of his Cross Col. 1. 20. And to have
reconciled us in the body of his flesh through death. Col. 1. 21, 22. that he
suffered, etc. that he might sanctify the people with his own blood. See Exodus
19. 10. -29. 21. Therefore those also who afterward break this Covenant are
said to have trodden under foot the Son of God, and to have counted the blood of
the Covenant wherewith they were sanctified an unholy thing, etc. Heb. 10. 29.
And lastly, hence as they did eat of their peaceofferings before the Lord Exodus
24. 5, 11. in token of their readmittance into his Friendship: so were we
likewise in this Covenant to be made partakers of the Lords Table, in ea^ing of
this Sacrifice of our Savior, offered for the establishing of the new Covenant;
and therefore this his flesh he has given us to eat and his blood to drink Jo.
6. 53. etc.

And God again raised this Mediator (who by 7. Performance of the promi^es put
into his hands revived.
his own blood sealed this our peace Col. 1. 20, 21, 22.) from the dead, that
he might show that he accepted of this his mediation; and that all things by
him transacted in it were according to his Fathers good pleasure; And that God
might give also into his own hands the management of all those gracious
promises made by him in this new Covenant; that he might be the Captain of our
Salvation; have power himself of the remission of sin, and of pouring forth the
spirit upon all flesh, see Act. 3. 26. -5. 31. and of giving eternal life, etc.
which were promised in it. Thus it became that God of peace to bring again from
the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through this blood of
the everlasting Covenant. Heb. 13. 20. That he might ever live to see to the
performance of conditions.

CHAP. IV. Jesus Christ the Sacrifice Expiatory; Eucharistical; etc. for
remission of sin; Procurement of Blessings, etc.
GOD would never give any blessing; nor forgive. 1. Christ the Sacrifice.
any fault absolutely gratis: but that he would in some offering returned, be
acknowledged Lord of all, for the one Mal. 1. 6, 8, 10. and with some offering
slain, be appealed for the other. That he might to the world more solemnly
appear, by the first offerings, a liberal Father to his Creature, and the
fountain of all good; and by the second a just Judge to the sinner, and the
hater Ps. 5. 5. and punisher of all evil. And hence the first worship of him,
that we find in the very infancy of the world, is Sacrifice, Genesis 4. 3, 4.
Sacrifice Eucharistical; and Expiatory: offerings of acknowledgment, and
thanksgiving for his benefits. (And those of the Firstlings Genesis 4. 4.) And of
expiation and atonement for our sin, and that by the death of the Sacrifice;
for death being the irreversible punishment of sin, without it might be no
remission. Heb. 9. 22. Besides which two we find also another sort of Sacrifice
always tendered unto him; a Sacrifice of a more general devotion and dedication
of the Officer to his service; an Holocaust or burnt-offering, wholly consumed
on the Altar, and of the most sweet smelling savor unto the Lord. Levit. 1. 9.
Exodus 29. 41. Being given freely not out of necessity for an offense, as the
sin-offering; and given all, not any part shared by the Doner, as in the peace
or thank-offering: Of which burnt-offerings one, a Lamb Jo. 1. 29. (in which
respect our Savior was called the Lamb of God rather then any other offering,
because this was the daily sacrifice) was offered every morning, and evening,
and was to lie upon the Altar continually, and upon this were all other
Eucharistical Sacrifices to be offered. Lev. 13. 5. -6. 12

Now as the irreversible doom from Gods eternal. 2.
justice, of sin, without which undergone it could not be blotted out, was
death; so it was also to be the death either of the sinner himself; or of as
worthy, or a more noble person in his stead, that should take the guilt of the
others sin upon him; God out of his infinite wisdom, and mercy to man leaving
this outlet of commutation of the person, that so observing his former decrees
by the death of his Son, he might save his creature from destruction. Therefore
the sacrifice and blood of Beasts became useless, (and much more that of one
guilty person for another, for his death could only answer for his own sin)
Heb. 10. 4. It was not possible for the blood of Bulls and Goats to take away
sin, neither did God in them take any pleasure. Ps 50. But only appointed them
as types and antifigures of that alsufficient acceptable sacrifice, which in
the fullness of times dispensed by God, was to be offered up Heb. 10. 14. for
us: In presignification of which transferring of man's guilt and sin upon
anothcr person that should suffer for him, The sinner was to lay his hand upon
the legal sacrifice that was to be accepted for him Levit. 5. 5. -44, 15, 26.
the like to which tho not with the same purpose, man did also upon his Savior,
and that, both the Gentile (for the Roman Soldiers had a part) and the Jew
jointly, making an oblation of him, tho they knew not what they did.

And this was the Son of God, who first, that he. 3.
might be a sacrifice, was Incarnate and became mortal flesh. Romans 8. 3.
Secondly, without all sin 2 Cor. 5. 21. for his own person, and so owed no
death to God for himself. In type of which the legal Sacrifices were required
to be perfect and without blemish, nor blind, nor broken, nor maimed, nor
scabbed Lev. 22. 22. and so the fruits to be the very best of them. Numb. 18.
12, 29, 30. Thirdly, in voluntarily presenting himself a devoted thing Jo. 17.
19. and a curse Gal. 3. 13. for others, (For which reason he not only took
human nature, but it by descent, from those who had sinned, and from those who
were restrained under a Law. See Gal. 4. 4, 5. Heb. 2. 10, 11, 14. was a
reasonable sacrifice in every thing like to those for whom he suffered, bearing
our guilt, and Gods wrath that pursued it, after the same manner that our
selves should have born it; The torments of which guilt we may a little guess
at from those we sometimes have suffered in our own consciences. Imagine him
then in every thing assuming the place of a sinner; so lamenting all offenses
as if he had done them. Imagine him perfectly knowing and weighing (which the
sinner never could) the number, the hainousness, the odiousness, the malice of
them toward his Father, so holy and so good; and then proportioning his grief
unto it. Consider again that zeal and sense and tenderness he had to his
Fathers glory and honor thus violated; then that knowledge-passing love Ephesians.
3. 19. and compassion to men his Brethren who had thus misbehaved themselves;
that whilst all other creatures served God and obeyed the law he had set them
Ps. 148. 6. He repented himself that he had made man upon the earth. Genesis 5. 6,
Next imagine him foreseeing also all the sins to come, mine and thine, and
among the rest the malice of his own people, the rejection of them and
destruction of their City and his Fathers house, which thing even in his
triumph had drawn tears from him Luke 19. 41. and this for shedding his blood
the purpose of which shedding was to have saved them; that through their final
obstinacy turned that to their ruin; which was of such infinite merit: and in
this passion, hear him saying again for them and all impenitent sinners. How
fain, how often would I have gathered, etc. and Daughters of Israel weep not for
me, but etc. Imagine then the sorrows he now underwent, for these men's offenses
that they might, and for those, because they could not, be forgiven; and then
tell me if ever sorrow was like unto his sorrow. And read his sad complaints
Ps. 38. and Ps. 40. 12. penned for our Savior, see Heb. 10. 5. Romans 7. 22. From
whence proceeded that deadly sadness Matt. 26. 37, 38. and fear Heb. 5. 7. and
amazement and faintings, and bloody sweat, which things never any sacrifice
suffered before him, nor any after him of those many holy Martyrs; (nay they
were in their passion sustained by him, but he in his (if I may use his own
Phrase) forsaken, nay smitten Esai. 53. 4. by his God, by his Father whom he
had never displeased) tho enduring perhaps more bodily torment, yet even had a
soul so overcharged, so anguished and afflicted which was sufficiently
discerned, as by those strange sweats, strong crying and tears and passionate
prayers to have put by that bitter cup: so by that loud exclamation upon the
Cross when the spirit left that sacred Temple of the body: forsaken, and yet
not forsaking; but committing it self into the hands of his Father. See Matt.
27. 46. Luke 23. 46. Heb. 5. 7. This anguish of Soul Mark. 14. is translated by
the vulgar pavor and toedium, by us amazedness and heaviness, of which the
Prophet Lam. 1. 12. was there ever sorrow, and the Psalmist Ps. 69. 20. I
looked for some to take pity but there was none; except only an Angel to
strengthen him to endure his grief: and a fellow to help him to carry his
Cross, not to remove them when he fainted under both. For the weight of all the
sins of all lay upon this innocent Lamb, even the betraying and murder of
those too that betrayed, that murdered him, as i^ he himself had committed the
misdemeanors; he suffered (toward whom mean while he burnt with such an ardent
love that upon the Cross he begged for them) and he assumed all the sufferings
nature was capable of to make abundant satisfaction for them (Which he that
will see at length, let him read the 22. 69. 35. Psalms penned for him as
appears by Matt. 27. 34, 46, 48. Jo. 2. 17. Jo. 15. 25.) whilst that all Gods
vindicative anger against us was poured out upon him: upon him a Sacrifice
reasonable, and so in an human manner sensible of the Divine indignation: which
Agonies of the Soul were followed with all the inhumanities and cruelties of
his executioners that could be offered to the body; both in the pains, and
reproach of his death. But the slaughter of this Lamb is too long a Tragedy to
be here set down. And God pitied Abraham's Son being a preludium to the death
of his own, so much as that he would permit him to suffer no more, then to
carry the wood only, the instrument whereon he was to suffer, and to have his
arms tied. But this sacrifice was not only offered up, but the Altar much
changed from that of the sacrifices under the Law. That he might undergo a more
accursed, and painful, and public, and long mactation. Hanged in a common
place of execution full of skulls, Matt. 27. 33. by the Highway side: ver. 39.
between two thieves, stripped naked, and (surely which never happened to any
besides) whilst he was suffering those acute pains, whilst the Serpent, and
death were thrusting their stings into him, instead of pity (which is then but
humanity) all the world deriding him: ( Ps. 69. 20. He looked for some to take
pity but there was none) mocked, reviled by the chief Priests, Scribes,
Elders, verse. 41. by the Soldiers with their bitter gall verse. 34. Luke 23. 35.
by the passengers verse. 39. and that nothing might be a wanting, by those
miserable creatures too, that were executed with him: whilst his acquaintance
stood a far off. See Psalm. 88. 7, 8. etc.

Thus therefore he, as the Lamb of God slain. 4.
from the beginning in the types of other Sacrifices, bestowed Himself on us,
and was offered unto his Father by us, and for us: a Lamb without spot and
without blemish, the only sacrifice acceptable unto God, of a sweet smelling
savor Ephesians. 5. 2. being an oblation devoted and consecrated to the Lord, not
only in his death but in all his life Romans 12. 1. which said of us, is much
more true of him. Nor only in his sufferings, see Esai. 53. 5. by his stripes
we are healed, but in all his obedience and service; not pleasing himself Romans
15. 3. or doing his own will in any thing, but his Fathers. Therefore says he
sacrifice thou would not have: Then said I lo I come to do thy will Ps. 40.
9. And this to fulfill not only one, but all those ends for which those
spiritual sacrifices under the Law were ordained, and which they only
obumbrated, the body being of Christ. Col. 2. 17. Through which sacrifice now we
do not only receive remission of his sins, pardonable only through him; but
present all our Devotions, praises, thanksgivings, acceptable only through him,
and obtain readmission into amity and fellowship with God, and receive all
deliverances and blessings temporal and eternal from God, only derivable unto
us through Him, To whom be glory for ever. Amen.

1. Then; He was the real Expiatory sacrifice for. ^. (...). 1 Sin-offering for
remission of guilt.
the sins of the world Matt. 26. 28. 1 Jo. 3. 1. answering to, and fulfilling
the type, of the Legal sinofferings; both of that slain and burnt without the
Camp, (according to which he also suffered without the gate Heb. 13. 11, 12.)
the blood of which was carried and sprinkled before the Lord into the innermost
Sanctuary, upon the solemn day of Expiation once a year Levit. 16. cap. and
into the outer Sanctuary at all other times Levit. 4. and 5. cap. (according to
which His also is now presented in the Heavenly Sanctuary Heb. 10. 19. -9. 12.
-8. 2. of which the other place was but a shadow and type Heb. 8. 5.) And of
that other scape-sacrifice Levit. 16. 21, 22. which, after the Priest had laid
his hands upon its Head, and confessed over it all the iniquities of himself,
and of the people, was let go into the wilderness (the like to which was also
done, in purifying of bodily uncleanness, in a scape-bird Lev. 14. 7.)
according to which He also is said to be the Lamb of God, that took and carried
away the sins of the world, after God had laid on him the iniquities of us all.
Esai. 53. 6. who died so as that he also was delivered from death; and as he
was resembled by the one sin-offering in his being slain; so by the other in
his being raised again. In which respect also, leaven, and honey, (which has
the same nature with it) suddenly fermenting, altering, and corrupting things
were forbidden, and contrarily salt preserving things, commanded, to be used in
all Sacrifices, being types doubtless of that which is said of, and was
fulfilled in the true sacrifice Ps. 16. 10. Thou will not leave my soul, etc.
which resurrection to life was a sign of Gods accepting this offering made for
us; as the Angel ascending to Heaven in the flame of the Altar was unto Manoah
( Judge. 13. 20, 23.) of the acceptance of his.

2. Again he was the Real, answering to the typical. 6. 2 For puri^ing
uncleanness.
sacrifice under the Law, the purifying of corporal uncleanness. See Lev. 14.
and 15. cap. As the blood of Bulls, and the ashes of an Heifer sanctified to
the purifying of the flesh; so the sprinkling of his blood offered without spot
to God, purging the conscience from dead works, etc. Heb. 9. 13, 14. see Heb.
9. 21, 23. comp. with Ephesians. 1. 10. Col. 1. 20. with which blood also as with
that other cleansing composition, there was running down from the Cross, a
mixture of water, Jo. 19. 34. He not suffering the ordinary punishment of other
Malefactors: but as on one side a bone of him was not broken (which was usual)
to represent the paschal Lamb; so on the other side his pericardium, and his
very heart was pierced (contrary to custom,) that blood and water, the
compound of our purification, might be drawn out of his sacred side; one for
the expiation of us from the guilt of punishment, for our justification in
respect of sins past; and the other for washing out of us the stain of sin, for
our sanctification from living in sin for the time to come. Blood signifying
our redemption by the effusion of his life: and water signifying our
regeneration by his effusion of the Holy Spirit Act. 2. 33. Jo. 7. 39. Matt. 3.
11. Therefore this was he, says the Apostle 1 Jo. 5. 6. that came by water and
blood, not by water only, but by water and blood: and he that saw them bare
record Jo. 19. 35. And these also bear record; the two Sacraments of the new
Testament; water in Baptism; and blood in the Lords supper; by which Sacraments
in virtue of his passion, our sins are now also remitted and cleansed. See Act.
2. 38. Matt. 26. 28. And these two together with the operations of the Spirit
^oyned with them shall bear witness on earth, and seal the effects of this
Sacrifice unto us, to the end of the world. 1 John 5. 8. see Ephesians. 5. 26, 27.

3. He was the Real Holocaust fulfilling the type. 7. 3 Holocavst
of the legal burnt-offering: In burnt-offerings and sacrifice for sin thou
had no pleasure; then said I, Lo I come Heb. 10. 4, 5. His only sacrifice
being of a sweet smelling Savor unto God, Ephesians. 5. 2. comp. with Lev. 19. Exodus
29. 41. which the sin-offering alone was not; Lev. 5. 11. Mumb. 5. 15. and
therefore might have no Frankincense nor Oil upon it. Lev. 5. 11. Numb. 5. 15.
In which only the Father was well pleased; Matt. 3. 17. -12. 18. For as he, in
our stead, was made sin and an accursed thing; and an offering that calling sin
to remembrance, suffered the extreme wrath of the Almighty due to sin; so in
himself (and this for our sake too) he was not only in his death, being a
voluntary and a free will-offering see Jo. 10. 15, 17, 18. comp. with Jo. 19.
30, 33. the other living longer: for this my Father loves me, etc. and so also
loves us for whom it is offered, for his sake Ephesians. 1. 6. but all his life an
Holocaust, consumed with the fire of love toward man, and zeal of the glory of
his Father, in a perfect devotement and resignation of his whole self to the
will of God, and in his perfect obedience and fulfilling of all his
Commandments. And then, when he had done working Jo. 17. 4. finishing this
Holocaust in suffering for the divine glory, for the truth; suffering till he
was all spent, and consumed with the zeal of his Fathers honor, laid upon which
whole burnt-offering, all our imperfect sacrifices of obedience and
resignation, of sufferings and martyrdom, of spending and being spent 2 Cor.
12. 15. Phil. 2. 17. 2 Timothy 2. 10. whereby God is made all in all, (and we,
nothing in our selves, and so one with him,) do partake also of the sweet savor
of this sacrifice, and all our prayers and petitions for our selves, or
intercessions for others, are accepted of God, and the descent of all good
things spiritual and temporal from him are procured. Genesis 8. 21. Jo. 14. 13.
Phil. 1. 12.

4. He was the grand Eucharistical sacrifice, and. 8. 4 Eucharistical; Peace or
thank-offering.
peace offering, answering to those typical ones under the Law. In which
respect the memorial which we now celebrate of his passion is called the
Eucharist; and in which relation we are made partakers in the Communion, and
admitted to eat of this sacrifice, see 1 Cor. 10. 16, 20. of which as a burnt
or sin-offering (tho these it is also) Heb. 13. 11, 12. we might not eat, for
none might eat of his own sin-offering. Now the peace offerings had many
several uses; in all which the sacrifice of our Savior fulfilled them.

1. They were a kind of federal oblation, after remission. 9.
of offenses, procured by the sin-offering; which was still offered before, not
after, the Peaceofferings, by which the sinner was (as it were) readmitted into
Gods favor; and (whereas he might not eat of the sin-offering) by eating part
of which sacrifice, being Gods bread Lev. 21. 6. -22. 25. and partaking of
these holy things, he was entertained at the table and accepted into the
fellowship of God, etc. Only none that was unclean or any stranger upon peril
of death might eat thereof. See Lev. 22.

Secondly, they were offerings of thanksgiving for all the Creatures, all the
blessings and good things first received from God: Genesis 1. 29. -9. 3. Ps. 50.
10, 11, 12. and continued by his word Genesis 1. 22. Deuteronomy. 8. 3. Matt. 4. 4. of
which therefore, (both of men and beasts and fruits) the choicest and first
were offered and sanctified unto the Lord as his portion and tribute: Sanctify
unto me all the first born, both of Man, and of Beast (and so also it was for
the first Fruits.) It is mine Exodus 13. 15, 2. And these accordingly they
offered: (these or their price), both to show their gratitude and
acknowledgment of Gods right as to these, so to all the rest; Deuteronomy. 8. 18. -28.
4, 5, 8, 11, 12. -26. 2, 10. Lev. 25. 23. -19. 24. and also to receive his
benediction through what was offered to him, upon all the rest. Ezech: 44. 30.
Lev. 23. 11, 14. Romans 11. 16.

Now according to this type Christ, the substance,. 9.
in whom all things are fulfilled and accepted (for what cares God for Oxen or
other Firstlings, or first fruits) not only the first born of his Mother but of
every Creature, and likewise the first fruits Col. 1. 15, 18. Romans 8. 29. 1
Cor. 15. 20, 23. was not redeemed but offered in his own person; offered unto
God; first, by whom all others were redeemed from the like: And secondly by,
and through which offering only, all our praises and thanksgivings are accepted
for all things: Ephesians. 1. 6. -3. 21. Col. 3. 17. Heb. 13. 15. Phil. 1. 11. and
the right to, and lawful use of, them procured unto us only by this offering.
Romans 14. 14. Ephesians. 1. 3. -4. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 5. Romans 8. 32. And again by it as a
federal oblation is the Covenant of grace and our peace ratified; To the eating
and partaking of which Sacrifice also, (in the mystical Sacrament of his Body
and blood) we are admitted to the worlds end:

And 1. By the eating of which (as the Jews, and. 10. By eating of which we
have Communion 1. with God.
also Idolaters were to the eating of theirs,) we are accepted in partaking of
this Table, to the unity, Communion and fellowship with God, see 1 Cor. 10. 14.
etc. to the 22. Only concerning which it is also provided that no unclean
person, or stranger unadmitted by Baptism, may approach to eat thereof 1 Cor.
11. 28, 29. Secondly, by eating and partaking of which sacrifice excelling the
other under the law, in as much as it is the Body and blood of the Son of God,
we are admitted to Communion with the 2 With his Son, and all that is his.
Son, and mystically incorporated into him; made members of his body, flesh of
his flesh, etc. And that not in a Metaphor, but in a great mystery says the
Apostle Ephesians. 5. 32. And then from being partakers of the body, become also
partakers of the Spirit of Christ 1 Cor. 6. 17. And from partaking of his
nature, the body and the spirit of the Son of God, become also Sons of God, and
heirs of eternal life 1 Cor. 12. 13. -6. 13, 15, 17. etc. Ephesians. 5. 29. Jo. 17.
2, 23.

By eating and partaking of one and the same. 11. 3 With the Saints, and all
that is theirs.
nourishment of this one Sacrifice, of this one bread 1 Cor. 10. 17. we also
become one Bread; and have Communion with all the Saints of God as well those
in Heaven, as those upon earth, partaking of all their glory, prayers, etc.

5. And hence with reference to this Sacrifice, as. 12. And are preserved in
both soul and body unto life eternal.

of the Rock in the Wilderness, which were types of Christ 1 Cor. 10. 2, 3, 4.
-12. 13. Jo. 6. 32, 35, 49. Our Savior is said to be the bread of life,
preserving him that eats the flesh of this Sacrifice so, that he shall live for
ever. And he that eats him shall live by him Jo. 6. 57.

6. Lastly he was the true Passover. Christ our Passover. 13. 4 The ^over.
is Sacrificed for us 1 Cor. 5. 7. He the true paschal Lamb fulfilling that
typical one of the Jews; In relation to which also when this Lamb was slain, it
was taken care that a bone of him should not be broken; tho theirs that
suffered with him were. That the Scripture might be in all things fulfilled in
him. And by the eating and the sprinkling of the blood of this, as of that (see
Exodus 12.) Lamb, it is (but we must do it with our staves in our hands, and our
loins girt, as then; i. e. prepared for another country) that we obtain the
true and everlasting redemption (of which that other was but a type) from
Satan, the destroying Angel; and from all the plagues which are to fall upon
the Spiritual Egypt of the reprobate world, even upon all those who have no
share in this Lamb; who is worthy to receive power, and riches, etc. because he
was thus slain, and has redeemed us with his blood Rev. 5. 9, 12.

creature; both comforting his own pains as it were with the society of their
misery; and satisfying his hate against God in any mischief upon his image; And
so upon sin we were presently seized upon by this Jailer; his Captives, and
prisoners; reserved for destruction: upon whom he inflicts also for the
present, all other miseries here suffered for sin. See 1 Cor. 5. 5. 1 Timothy 1.
20. Ps. 78. 49. Exodus 12. 23. Rev. 9. 11. 1 Cor. 10. 10. 1 Chronicles. 21. 1.
compared with 2 Samuel 24. 1. Luke 13. 15, 16. And therefore all venomous and
noxious creatures to us, are called his instruments Luke 10. 19. But secondly,
we are not subject to him only as an Executioner and an inflicter of
punishment, but as the Prince, the God 2 Cor. 4. 4. of this lower world, that
upon the departure 2 As Prince of this world
of the good spirit presently possessed us as his best house, and lodging here
below Matt. 12. 44. Col. 1. 13. the spirit that works mightily (says the
Apostle) in the children of disobedience Ephesians. 2. 2. and we are become of Gods,
his, children Act. 13. 10. Jo. 8. 44. And the lusts of him our Father now we
do; so that as in innocence we did no good but by the assistance of the good
spirit; so since the fall we hardly do any evil, but by the suggestion of the
ill spirit. See Act. 5. 3. 1 Cor. 7. 5. 1 Chronicles. 21. 1. 1 King. 22. 22. 1 Timothy
5. 15. 2 Cor. 2. 11. etc. So that as he has power as Gods Sergeant to inflict
death at last; so he has power, as Gods enemy in this his Kingdom of the Air,
of Darkness, of this world, to make us serve him while we live; power both
regal, and paternal over us: yet without either the protection of a Prince, or
affection of a Father; making us do that only, for which afterward he may
punish us. God indeed having put enmity between him and man from the beginning.
Genesis 3. He being told that at last he should be destroyed by the woman's seed,
and therefore rejoicing in nothing so much as to destroy her seed, Rev. 12. And
into the hands of this his enemy was now man fallen; And him a very powerful and
dreadful enemy Ephesians. 6. 12. For note 1. That as man has not by his fall, so
neither the Devil by his, lost all the privileges of his nature; and being
permitted still his being, is allowed also all the operations belonging to it:
retaining power and subtilty 2 Cor. 2. 11. Ephesians. 6. 11. according to the measure
of the spiritual strength and knowledge of other Angels. 2. That tho as man
sinning was ejected out of Paradise; so he out of the blessed place of his
first habitation Jude. 6. unto these lower and darker regions of the world;
called Prince of them because they are the place of his abode; yet here has he
not received the final restraint and judgment for his sin; which shall be
passed upon him when upon others i. e. at the general day of doom as well for
Angels, as men see Rev. 20. 10. 1 Cor. 6. 3. 2 Pet. 2. 4. 3. That mean while in
this dejection, As God has not taken away their natural power of hurting and
seducing from wicked men, so neither from the wicked spirits: which power the
Devil exercises as a tempter toward the good, and as a Prince, over the wicked
in this his kingdom of the air. Only as God restrains the power of wicked, by
the opposition of good, men: so of the wicked, by the opposition of good,
Angels, of the Holy Spirit, of Christ himself, King over all: and both evil men
and angels by the secret limitations of his providence Job 1. 10. and restrains
those so much more, who are less resistable; and this more in respect of some
then of others: the children of God being more protected from his seducements,
(by a greater power of the Holy Spirit residing in them, etc. 1 Jo. 4. 4. Luke
22. 31.) the children of disobedience more abandoned to his will and commands.
2 Timothy 2. 26. Ephesians. 2. 3.

Thus, man being in his lapsed condition; the. 5.
Apostle makes (as it were) four persons; sin, the law, and death, and Satan
tyrannizing over him; and keeping him in an irremediable subjection, possessed
instead of the free loving good spirit of God, with the spirit of bondage Romans
8. 15. and of fear, and of this world. See sin, (which is called also the
flesh, and the old man), described as a person Romans 7. 9, 11. Jam. 1. 14, 15.

51. Romans 5. 14. And they assault him in this order. Sin slayes him by the dart
of the law; for the strength of sin is the law: and death slayes him by the
sting of sin; for the sting of death is sin 1 Cor. 15. 56. and Satan slayes him
by the hand of death. As he who has the power of death from Gods justice. Heb.
2. 14. Lastly (Satan having no power but from God,) the justice of God
commits us into the hands of this officer, till we shall pay the debt of
sin, by the first Covenant due unto him.

Man being in this deplorable condition; the Son. 6. Christ our Redeemer.

served for the discharge of a debt, had we been, saving some trespasses past,
in a perfect and entire condition for the future: but besides the fruit already
brought forth unto death, for which we owed it, we were also subjected to the
dominion of these enemies, to bring forth more still for the future. In respect
of which no complete redemption of us could be without a conquest of them as
well as a payment. And had our Redeemer not made a conquest of them; had he
been either pierced by sin; or broken any point of the Law; how then indeed
could he have paid that death, a ransom for 2 By making a Conquest free^ us

us, which had been due for himself? Again not breaking these, had he yet been
any way held by death and Satan; since, tho the ransom was paid for sins past,
yet their dominion would have remained still in us for producing more; How
could he deliver us from this dominion, from which he could not save himself?
In which terms the Devil once began to insult over him on the Cross: thou that
savest others, etc. How could he rescue us from death, being himself detained
in it; how by his spirit in us destroy sin, if that spirit could not raise him
from the punishment of sin; for all our spirit and life is only from and in
him. In whose death all our hopes were also dead. 1 Cor. 15. 14. Therefore
says the Apostle 1 Cor. 15. 14, 17. If Christ be not risen from death, ye are
yet in your sins. See Romans 4. 25. 1 Timothy 3. 16. Indeed we were not only
prisoners for debt to Satan, as an Officer of Gods justice Matt. 5. 25, 26; but
captives to him as Prince of this world: and therefore our Savior was our
Redeemer also in two senses: from debt; and from slavery: by paying a ransom;
and by making a conquest: which he thoroughly did. For sin could not enter into
him; nor the law could not accuse him in any point: nor could death, tho it had
him in its arms, hold him Act. 2. 24. and so Satan also that had the power of
death, yet in his reviving from death was overcome Heb. 2. 14. by the power of
the holy spirit raising him again from it. See Romans 1. 4. 1 Timothy 3. 16. Heb. 9.
14. Gal. 1. 4. And that he might be a pattern unto us in the way and of the
victory of sufferings; the manner he chose to conquer these enemies was by
subjecting himself unto them, and by making himself capable of their assaults,
and by suffering from them, By coming in the likeness of sinful flesh he
destroyed sin in the flesh: by dying killed and triumphed over death. (In which
Sampson slaying his enemies by his own being slain, and Eliah raising the dead
child by imitating the same postures were types of him.) Destroyed the Devils

seemed good to his wisdom, by, and for, and to, whom are all things, as he
made not perfect the world all at once, but successively; nor sent this Author
of redemption before the latter end thereof, so neitheir to make perfect our
redemption all at once.

For indeed had sin, and consequently the law,. 9. And why.
and death, and Satan upon our Saviors resurrection been utterly destroyed, why
should not all the Faithful that were before his coming, as well as we since,
have enjoyed the same privilege? Again thus the world must have ended at our
Saviors first coming. 1 Cor. 15. 26. But the completing of our redemption is
reserved to his second, Luke 21. 28. Ephesians. 4. 30. Ephesians. 1. 14. and we see not yet
all things put under our Savior in this manner: For it pleased God to make our
Savior only the Captain, and we also (but this wholly through the strength of him,
who is the Author and finisher of our Salvation) partners in this conquest;
giving us arms and strength to fight them, but not victory without our fighting
too after the same manner, as did our Savior. It pleased him, that we should
yet a while longer suffer the assaults of sin, but repel them; overcome the
Devil, but not without being tempted; and death but not without suffering it;
and the law, but not without obedience to it; Lastly, that in these things we
should suffer in some sort for our Savior, i. e. for his honor, as he did for
us, i. e. for our wickedness; that herein all virtues might more be exercised;
and Gods glory through opposition more exalted.

It remains then we enquire next, How much of. 10. How much already performed.
our redemption is performed already by this our Savior? First, tho some sin
is hitherto still inherent in us, yet we are restored to the spirit of God lost
by 1 In respect of sin.

dominion of sin for the future. In which respect we are said to be dead to sin.

2. 1 Tho we are still tied to the obedience of the. 11. 2 Of the law.
law moral, yet we are freed from the law Ceremonial, it being only typical of
the things which were fulfilled in Christ. At his death when he cried
consummatum est (tho before he both observed it himself, and commanded it also
to others, see Luke 2. 21. Matt. 10. 5. -15. 24. -8. 4) he freed us perfectly
from this. 2. Again, freed from the condemnation of the law Moral: both 1. By
having our former debts to it discharged by him; and so this bond, that was
kept against us, cancelled and nailed through upon the Cross Ephesians. 2. 15. Col. 2.
14. 2. And freed by grace given us from that inability we had heretofore to
perform it, by being now enabled to observe it in all the parts thereof (tho
not without some defects). And there is now no sort of sin, how natural, how
customary soever (uncleanness, intemperance, revenge, etc.) but we have
sufficient ability through Christ to master, conqu^r; triumph over it, so as never
to commit any one more ( consummate) act thereof, if we will but use those
weapons the spirit affords us, prayer, etc. Insomuch, as that we shall admire,
upon trial, the strange transformings of our selves, and the great goodness and
power of Christ. ^3. And in those deficiencies by being delivered also from the
curse of it through Christ by repentance and faith in him Act. 13. 38, 39. Nay yet
further; freed not only from the condemning power, but from the commanding and
directing power, of the law Mosaic; not that we now are without law, 1 Cor. 9.
21. but that we have it, much fuller, then it was before in the Tables, written
in our hearts; by which we walking in the spirit, and being filled with love,
do all things commanded in the law by the demonstration and power of the
Spirit: see those places much to be noted Gal. 5. 13. 1 Timothy, 1. 5, 9. Gal. 3.
19. Romans 8. 15. And thus we are said to be dead to the law, or it to us Romans 7.
4. Gal. 2. 19. Dead to the former delivery of it, by the giving of which we
were not able to perform it, as now we are when it is given us by the spirit:
for the law is given twice, at the first by Moses written in Tables of Stone,
so a killing letter; afterward by the spirit written on the heart, and so it is
a quickening spirit, that now does the work of the law, which law abides for
ever. Matt. 5. 18. 2 Cor. 3. 6. see Heb. 10. 11. 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8. the difference
of the ministrastration of the spirit and the ministration of Moses. Romans 8. 2.

3. Tho we are still subject to death, yet we are. 12. Of Death.
freed already from the most considerable death, from that eternal; and from
the fear of the temporal; yea we are now inviting and desiring it, as an
entrance into our Saviors presence, and eternal bliss. (Nay further taking
pride to conquer it the same way our Lord did, and turning all the preparatives
thereof, diseases, infirmities, etc. by willing, patient, cheerful suffering
thereof, into matter of advantage and reward; so that we had been less happy in
a greater present conquest.) Phil. 21, 23. Again freed (as our Savior was Heb.
5. 7.) tho not from suffering it; yet, that we shall not perish in it, but
after a while be recovered from it. Therefore harmless now it has changed its
name in the new Testament Scriptures, and is called a sleep 1 Cor. 11. 30. In
which respect we are said already to be passed from death to life. Jo. 5. 24.

4. Tho we are still subject to the temptations of. 13. Of Satan.
Satan, yet are we freed from his former power in and over us Act. 26. 18. by
the more powerful spirit of God, which is now greater in us then he that is in

Jo. 12. 31. -16. 11. 1 Jo. 3. 8. Luke 10. 18, 19. Matt. 12. 21. Accordingly
since our Saviors coming we see the Devils former gross religions and
delusions, (except in some out-skirts of the world America and China, etc.)
utterly ruined, and him abridged most what of all his former inspirations, (for
many of the lying Prophets were possessed and deceived (themselves) by an evil
spirit see Micah 2. 11. 1 King. 22. 20.) possessions, enthusiasms, apparitions,
dictating Oracles, by which he, being very frequent in these, was taken to be
the great power of God. See Act. 8. 10. - 16. 16. comp. 17. 1 Samuel 18. 10. 2
King. 1. 2. 1 Cor. 12. 10. -14. 29, 32. 1 Jo. 4. 1. and sustained by his
frequent inanimations of them, that gross worship of idols which are since
grown contemptible according to the prophecies. Zech. 13. 1, 2. Esai. 46. 1.
comp. Esa 45. 13, 16. Esai. 2. 18, 20. Hos. 2. 17. So that now he is glad to
use more fine and subtle arts (for he is not yet utterly to be chained up.) And
the chief religion abhors idols, and worships the true God that made Heaven and
Earth; but only opposes the Savior thereof, and him too not altogether
rejects, but diminishes in comparison of the Devils Prophet, Mahomet. And
tho he is not yet quite chained up from seducing the Nations, nor tempting also
the servants of Christ, yet in respect of every one, as he is weaker or
stronger in grace, so by him that sits now at the right hand of God, are his
temptations moderated and proportioned, none suffering above what they are able
to repel. 1 Cor. 10. 13. And the weaker, as they loose the glory of a conquest,
so have they the security of not being assaulted: whereas it is much to be
observed that (for their greater reward) our Savior permits Satan more liberty
as it were to try Masteries with those that are stronger (even sometimes to
visible apparitions, as he assaulted first their Lord, and there want not
examples of this done to many more, when eminent in holiness) as he did to Holy
Job, to the Apostles: who by this discovered more of Satan's wiles, and more
easily discerned the spiritual powers, that war against Christians, and gave
readier directions for the fight. See Luke 22. 31. 2 Cor. 12. 7. 2 Cor. 2. 11.
Ephesians. 6. 12, 16. Jam. 4. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 8, 9. Ephesians. 4. 27.

But when our Redemption is completed, which (...)
must not be before our Saviors appearing and his Kingdom 2 Timothy 4. 1. then
shall we have, by virtue of this our Redeemers ransom, and conquest already
performed, and the full effects of which are already enjoied, in his own
person; all freedom from them, that can be imagined. First, Concerning sin:
That quite effaced, and we Glorious, Holy, and without blemish, not having
spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but perfectly sanctified and cleansed, and
so as a pure virgin presented and espoused unto the Son of God. Ephesians. 5. 26, 27.
2 Cor. 11. 2. 2. Concerning the law: love perfected, and we necessitated to
good in such a manner, that our actions there shall no more be capable of
reward or punishment; and consequently that there shall be no more place for a
law. 3. As for death it shall be swallowed up in victory, and cast into Hell
Rev. 20. 14. 1 Cor. 15. 26. Rev. 22. 2, 3. 4. Satan also who now goes abroad
to deceive the Nations, shall then be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone:
and the Accuser of the Saints shall then be judged by them; and condemned to
those everlasting torments, which are prepared for him, and his Angels from the
beginning. Rev. 20. 10. 1 Cor. 6. 3. Matt. 25. 41.

in the mystery of the Incarnation; here God the Father only represents the
whole Deity in its Glory and Majesty; and God the Son then divested, stripped,
and emptied Himself of that form of God, in which he was; and (in respect of
the use and exercise of it, further then as the Father pleased to dispense it
unto him) of all the Majesty and power of his Divinity; In which thing our
blessed Lord was fore-typified by Sampson: for thus was he for the love of an
Harlot (we were no better) willing to part with, and to lay aside all his
strength; to be bound by his own Nation, and delivered up to his enemies, Judge.

strengthened by one of those Angels whom he had made Luke 22. 43. (not to name
that treating with him by Ambassadors from Heaven Luke 9. 31. one from the law,
and another from the Prophets, about his sufferings.) Besides those natural
inclinations and velleities (if I may so say), that appeared in him of the
lower faculties; soliciting for things convenient to them; tho always ordered
(by reason and the Spirit) to conformity with the will of God: see Jo. 6. 38.
Romans 15. 3. Matt. 26. 39. [Where we discover natural propensions diverse from
those of the Spirit, tho these proposing their own desires, not opposing the
others resolves.] But some think, in the Intellectual part also: either 1. The
absence of some knowledge (supernatural to man and non debitoe inesse) for some
time by the suspension of the light of his Divinity from it; as it is clear the
Beatifical vision was suspended from it in the time of his sad and dolorous
passion. Which knowledge increased in him according to the dispensation of the
Father. See Luke 1. 80. -2. 52. where Christ is said to increase in wisdom and
spirit, etc. not in appearance only, but with God as well as men: see Mark. 13.
32. comp. with Rev. 1. 1. and this with Rev. 5. 5, 6. etc. where the Lamb is

signified verse. 6. by the 7 eyes; as power by the 7 horns,) for that he was

thing happened unexpected. Or; 2. The absence of that experimental knowledge
which he afterward acquired by sufferings, see Heb. 5. 8. -2. 17, 18. Or, 3. at
least see Jo. 16. 30. -21. 17. some restraint of the effects, and external
manifestations of his knowledge; till the time the Father had appointed for
them to be opened. See Act. 17. comp. with Rev. 1. 1. and Mark. 13. 32. Matt.
20. 23. Therefore he is said in his youth to have heard the Doctors of the Law,
and conferred with them: (tho by this doubtless he learned not from, but
imparted wisdom to, them. Luke 2. 46, 47.) Nor did he offer to teach till the
age allowed for Doctors to profess. And not then, till after he had as it were
prepared himself for it, in six Weeks solitude, silence, watching, fasting,
prayer. (For he who prayed whole nights, when all the day wearied with
emploiments, certainly omitted it not in that long vacation.) And so for the
external operations of the Spirit it self; tho he was by the Holy Ghost
conceived; and had it not stinted, and given by measure as others Jo. 3. 34.
Col. 1. 19. (who yet are said also to be filled with the Holy Ghost as the
blessed Virgin and St Stephen, and some even from the womb, as St John Baptist.
See Luke 1. 15. Act. 7. 55.) yet the more public functions of it were
restrained till at 30 years of age that he was baptized; and that it, at the
solemnity, visibly descended on him; and then he began in the strength of it,
to preach, do Miracles, etc. Luke 4. 1. Jo. 2. 11. -4. 54. And so his power,
tho always as God equal to the Fathers, Jo. 3. 35. yet for the actual exercise
and execution of it as man, successively given him according to the
fore-appointments of the Father. In which respect he says more emphatically
and with signification of some enlargement of it (I mean as Man) All power is
given me, etc. Matt. 28. 28. Jo. 5. 20. Jo. 14. 12. -17. 12. -16. 7. Matt. 11.

nature not from the donation of the Word, the second person united to it; but
from the Donation of the Father. For tho (as it is showed before) he has all
dependence on the Father even in those perfections, wherein he is equal to the
Father, by reason of his eternal generation, as the Son; yet now he has
another dependence also in this emptied condition, as his creature; in which
respect he became so much his inferior. It was the Spirit (called also the
power, the glory, of the Father Romans 6. 4. 2 Cor. 13. 4. Luke 1. 35.) that
overshadowed the Virgin at his conception; that anointed and sanctified Jo. 10.
36. him at his Baptism Luke 4. 18. Act. 10. 38. (for he did not anoint or
glorify himself Heb. 5. 4, 5.) that sealed him Jo. 6. 27. comp. Ephesians. 1. 13.
that carried him into the Wilderness, Matt. 4. 1. Luke 4. 14. by which he
fasted so long, and did so many Miracles, Act. 2. 22. Matt. 12. 28. by which he
was said to be in the Father, and the Father in him, (as he prays his
Disciples also might be) Jo. 17. 21, 23. -8. 29. and these only by the Spirit
could be so. By which he had power to lay down and take up his life when he
pleased in respect of men's power Jo. 10. 18. -2. 19. and to give and to
Communicate life to whom he pleased, etc. (for he received both this life, and

dead Romans 1. 4. -6. 4. 2 Cor. 13. 4. 1 Pet. 3. 18. Heb. 5. 5. and that
justified him, that he was all that he pretended to be. 1 Timothy 3. 16. (And the
final justification of all the Saints also, and declaration of them to be
accepted by God, will be by the same Spirit at their Resurrection glorifying
them); at last that exalted him to Heaven: For from the Father it was, that he

would deliver them from the evil, etc. Luke 22. 32. That Satan might not
overthrow Peter's faith: and Matt. 16. 17. where he imputed Peter's confession to
the Revelation of his Father. He prayed to the Father for all things when
wanted: and returned thanks for them when received ( Jo. 11. 41. where his
giving thanks that he was heard, implies he prayed the Father about raising of
Lazarus, tho this not set down) Matt. 11. 25. see Matt. 26. 30.. In which
prayers too tho the Father heard him always Jo. 11. 42. for all things he
asked with a deliberate and plenary will 1 Jo. 5. 14. which was always

and then against all assaults of it, so faithfully in all things serving his

perfection, that it can suffer for him. But however this good use we may make
of this exinanition and incarnation, namely, to argue of it as St James of
Elias Jam. 5. 17. Jesus a man subject to like passions as we, so weak, so
tempted as we; He assisted by the same spirit of the Father as we; he did, he
endured, he received so great things: therefore we should, and may do and
suffer by the same spirit the like; and if we do so shall receive the like, 1 John 3. 2, 3. such as that man now is, such men may be, if such they now be as
he was; who was pleased to be in all things as they are, saving the
preeminences he has from the hypostatical union.

man, to pass now from the form, to the virtue, of his manship; and to show how
he was the second man, to repair with advantage all the mischiefs coming to
mankind by the first; being made such a common person to them, as none besides
him but the first man was; who in all things was a type and figure of him that
was to come. Romans 5. 14. And the parallel between them we may read at large
Romans c. 5. from the 12. v. to the end. And 1 Cor. 15. 20. etc. 45. etc. to the
50th. And such a Covenant as was made with Adam of Reward for obedience;
Reward, to him, and to his seed; if (being enabled by the same spirit) they
should follow his steps; (In whom we may gather all the world should have been
blessed had he stood; because all were cursed in his fall, unless Gods justice
be larger then his mercies:) The same Covenant, upon the first man's
miscarriage, we find entered into by the early promised seed of him that fell,
Christ; that, as by one man to us came death, so by another might come life;
and that the second might conquer the Serpent, by which the first was stung. I
come, (says he) to do thy will O God which the First disobeyed: Thy law is
within my heart. Ps. 40. 8. Heb. 8. 10. Matt. 6. 17. And accordingly he was
made under the law; all the law that might be; both Moral and Ceremonial. And
to him thus undertaking on the one part, the promise was made by God on the
other: the promise not only for himself, which needs not to be doubted, see
Heb. 11. 6. but for his seed also. See Gal. 3. 16, 19, 22. Namely that all the
world should be blessed in him, as in the first they were cursed; Blessed,
first in receiving the promise of the spirit, as the earnest and seal of the
inheritance, Gal. 3. 14. Act. 2. 32. and then the inheritance it self, of
eternal life; which promises he upon his obedience received first himself, and
then traduced to his posterity. Of whom indeed Abraham and afterward David (for
with him also was a Covenant made concerning his seed) were but types; the
promise of being Father of the faithful and heir of the world Romans 4. 13. being
made to Abraham only in this seed, see Heb. 1. 2. Gal. 3. 17. and so said to be
fulfilled now in his Resurrection or rewardment. Act. 13. 32, 33. In which seed
the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, were first blessed (according to the
promise) Gal. 3. 8.

And so only he the true Father of all the faithful. 8. He fulfils it.
Heb. 2. 13, 14. Esai. 9. 6. of whom Abraham their Father was also a Son. And
this second Adam coming to perform this obedience, and to obtain these promises
for undone man, that he might destroy the former works both of the Devil, and
of man by his instigation 1 Jo. 3. 8. and show that our standing is by
humility, as our fall was by pride, was made in a quite contrary way to the
first. For as the first By walk^ (...) a quite contrary way to the first.
came out of the Earth, of no worth in himself: So he came from Heaven no less
then the eternal Son of God. And as the first being from so mean an extraction,
made Lord of all the world and placed in a Garden of pleasure, yet harkening to
the Serpent, who represented the Devil whose wiles still tempt us; and to his
wife, who being also his own flesh, then represented the flesh which now tempts
us; and enticed likewise by the fairness of the forbidden fruit, which
represents the pleasures of the world now tempting us; whilst he thought by
tasting of this to attain, I know not what, wisdom and happiness, in the event
lost himself and us by his ambition and pride; after the similitude of whose
transgression his posterity daily offends by the same temptations. So this
second Adam of so noble a descent, by the contrary ways to these conquered and
recovered all the former's losses; (that is) 1 By annihilating himself, when he
was before Lord of all things, to answer the other's magnifying Himself being
nothing, and by assuming also amongst men a low and afflicted condition: His
kindred so mean the people were much offended at it, that a Prophet should have
such a poor alliance. Mark. 6. 3, 4. By becoming a man of sorrows and
acquainted with griefs; without form or comeliness, despised and rejected of
men, abhorred of his own Nation, of his kindred, laughed to scorn and made
mouths at, see Esai. 49. 7. -53. 2, 3. Ps. 22. 7. one of a manual trade, a
Carpenter Mark. 6. 5. Jo. 7. 15. and a long time an Apprentice at it, for
anything we know, till 30 years old; so much time passed in obscurity and
silence Luke 3. 23. for any thing that is mentioned of him, except his three
days spent at Jerusalem when twelve years old about his heavenly Fathers
business; In the time of his preaching afterward by being of such professed
poverty, as that he had not where at night after his toilsome work to rest his
head, Matt. 8. 20. (as he told a Scribe what he was to expect if he followed
him) but when he had taught all day in the City, went at night and lay on an
hill Luke 21. 37. Mark. 11. 17. even depriving himself of that ordinary
provision, which his Father makes for the Beasts and for the Fowls. And as for
his followers their eating green Corn, and that on no fasting day, argued they
made many hungry meals. Matt. 12. 1. So that to follow him might well be
called taking up a daily Cross, Luke 9. 23. therefore, it is observed, he chose
men hardy, not learned, to endure all labors. Especially when as they were
likewise to do all their work (preach, cure diseases etc. gratis (gratis

Again by being of such professed and wonderful humility, so avoiding of all
honor or applause; that, besides the living so obscurely, and unknown of this
wisdom and power of God for 30 years, he afterward resorted to no Princes
Courts at all, was seldom amongst the Rabbis, not often in great Cities; very
rarely at Jerusalem except a little before his passion; (chid for it by his
Friends. Jo. 7. 4.) Made no ostentation of his knowledge, but veiled and
covered it in Parables and Proverbs; which was not without some prejudice to
him, see Jo. 16. 29, 30. and when they admired it, he told them he spoke not of
himself; It was not his own wisdom but his that sent Him Jo. 7. 16. and this

avoid the encountering of any temptation): called therefore a Winebibber, and
keeper of ill company; questioned for not fasting; and He and his Disciples
disesteemed in comparison of the Baptist and his. Matt. 9. 14. In his riding in
triumph into Jerusalem at the same time, when other paschal Lambs also destined
for the slaughter were solemnly brought in, see Exodus 12. 3, 6. taking only an
Ass, nay possibly only a little Colt of an Ass to ride on in this his great

See the parallel between them in many things.. 9.
The Devil tempting both about eating contrary to the good pleasure of God (as
may be gathered from our Saviors answer Matt. 4. 4.) saying to one yea has God
said ye shall not eat: and to the other; Command that these Stones be made
Bread, encouraging both to presumption: saying to one, He has given his Angels
charge over thee, to the other ye shall not die: and alluring both with fair and
false promises, Eritis sicut Dii, and Omnia haec tibi dabo. But indeed
supposing our Savior in a condition much more liable to the temptation in
offering meat, and that usual, not prohibited food as Adam's was, to one
hungry, not to one satiated with all other delicacies: Honor and wealth to one
poor and despised: and suggesting special care of Angels to one that was the
Son of God, tho then having voluntarily abbridged himself for his Fathers
greater Honor the privilege thereof. Yet he not hearkening to these wiles so
much as to do any thing for his own reputation (tho Satan failed not to prompt
him who, and how great he was): no not to show his power in flying down from a
pinnacle, or in producing bread by Miracle, tho both in a seeming case of
necessity; but answering, he must live by the word of God, in every thing doing
as God appointed him; for that was his bread to do the will of his Father; and
accordingly he made not bread for himself who made it for others; but God sent
Angels to minister it unto Him. So that the Prince of this world had no such
thing in him, as he had in the first man Jo. 14. 30; Again, by not being
entised here by any false beauty of this world, set before, and presented unto,
him Matt. 4. 8. nor indulging so much as the innocent inclinations of the
flesh; by whose necessities, sleep, hunger, rest, he was often importuned; but
versed in continual mortifications of it; watching, fasting, weeping, and all
the inconveniences of poverty and travailing; by denying to himself many useful
things permitted, as the other longed after unnecessary things forbidden. By
earnestly desiring and so cheerfully entertaining all sufferings, and that
cruel passion, (tho he showed, how easily he could have avoided it, when at his
speaking but one word to them, his apprehenders went backward, and fell to the
ground Jo. 18. 6. till by his own leave (like Sampson) they took and bound
him): also that he had the full sense and reluctance of nature toward it, that
we have (without which his sufferings had not been so meritorious) in that
passionate deprecation of it in the Garden, where he in his own person
described unto his Disciples the battle of Sense to show them the victory of
the Spirit, calling it his baptism, his Eucharist. See Luke 22. 15. -12. 50.
Jo. 14. 31. Mark. 10. 32. where he outwent, and lead toward Jerusalem the
place of this Tragedy, his Disciples afraid and drooping because of that storm
he had told them was coming; led them on, tho he foresaw, and numbered, and
foretold so punctually every opprobrious circumstance thereof (of which other
Martyrs are happily ignorant) even to the Soldiers spitting upon him, verse. 33.
see Jo. 18. 4, 8. How he sought to save his Disciples, and, I had almost said,
prevented Judas's betraying him, for whom he was so much troubled in spirit Jo.
13. 21. by meeting the Soldiers, and offering himself, and charging them
(astonished) to let the others go; by his sovereign authority securing from
harm all but himself, Jo. 18. 9. and giving himself for them, not only in his
passion, but to, it. In which sufferings, he did not one Miracle before the
King to save his life, nor spoke a word to defend so innocent a cause; but
invited as it were their condemnation with a resolute silence. And when as he
had power at any time to have laid down his life; yet by his former avoiding
stoning and precipitation preserved he himself for a more open shame and
greater torments. Thus by contraries he undid the works of the Devil in the
first Adam; and conquered and triumphed by humility and afflictions, as the
other fell by pride and Paradise; leaving this special lesson to the world,
Learn of me for I am meek and lowly. After the similitude of whose
righteousness also all his posterity since do overcome; namely by resistance of
temptations, by humility, and by sufferings. See Phil. 3. 10. 2 Cor. 4. 10.
Gal. 6. 7. Col. 1. 12. Gal. 5. 24. 1 Cor. 4. 11. etc. 2 Cor. 6. 4. etc. Well
might he therefore proclaim learn of me for I am lowly, etc. And as it is said
of the Saints in glory, quanto altiores, tanto humiliores; and as himself said:
the greatest must be as it were a child. Matt. 18. 4. So doubtless never was
there man thus perfectly humble in all things, as was this the Son of God. The
meekness of whose spirit may be clearly seen in this, that many, whom the ill
nature of his Disciples repulsed, he continually entertained; never denying any
help he could give to any that sought to him. See Matt. 19. 13, 14. -15. 23,
24. Mark. 10. 48, 49. -9. 38, 39. Luke 9. 54, 55. Matt. 14. 15. comp. Mark. 8.

of Adam. So that look how much the first Adam contributed to our destruction;
much more has the second for our Salvation.

To number up all whose derived blessings upon. 11. His particular benefits.
mankind more particularly, we are first to take notice: that sin having entered
into the world by the first man, and after it death; this second Parent was
forced in the first place to undo the works of the former; and to clear the
malevolent influence that came from him, before he could impart to us his own;
and remove the punishment the first brought on us, before regain the reward, he
lost us. Therefore as the first Adam sinned, and we bar^ 1 As our ^ead,
communicates absolution from sin by his death for it.
part of his iniquity, so we sinning the second Adam bore all our iniquities:
and as we by partaking the first Adams flesh became heirs of his sin, so he by
partaking ours became (if I may so say) heir of our sins. And that even of the
sins of the whole world; as not some few but all mankind were sinners and
perished in Adam; That the restitution might be as large as the fall. This man
upon the precious Cross offered a price of man's redemption, not only sufficient
for all the Sons of Adam, and yet limited by him to some few i. e. the saved;
but also actually tendered to God his Father indifferently without exception
for them all. See 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. where the Apostle argues that all the sons
of the first Adam were dead in sin, because the second Adam died for them all.
See Heb. 2. 9. 2 Pet. 2. 1. Romans 14. 15. 1 Cor. 8. 11. 1 Jo. 2. 2. Romans 5. 18.
1 Timothy 2. 6. So those that perish Heb. 10. 29. by apostasy could not be said to
have trodden under foot the Son of God, and the blood of the Covenant, if no way
pertaining to them: and so in the Holy Communion if not his body offered also
for, and to, the wicked, how could they be guilty of his body and blood? 1 Cor.
11. 27. That therefore this blood becomes not effectual and profiting to all
(in respect of which that phrase for many is used Matt. 26. 28.) it is because
of the conditions to be performed on every man's part, that it may be beneficial
unto him. See Joh. 3. 16, 17. Or also (to take the strictest opinion of
predestination) because the Father has so pleased to enable only some of the
seed of Adam to the performance of such conditions. But the Son in all things
obedient and subject to his Father chose or picked out none, no not his twelve
Disciples, but took into his diligent protection those, whom ever the Father
pleased to give him: and even amongst the twelve in submission to his Fathers
will chose one of them, well foreknowing it Jo. 6. 70. to shed his blood. See
Jo. 17. 6, 9, 24. Jo. 6. 65. Act. 13. 48. -15. 13. Jo. 10. 26. Matt. 11. 25.
Romans 11. 7. and with a Divine patience tolerated him, robbing him of his
necessary provisions, before he betrayed his sacred person. See Jo. 12. 6.
Nothing therefore is there on the account of the universality of his precious
sacrifice, why every single Son of Adam may not be saved by the plentiful
effusion of that all-meritorious stream of his blood; which gushed out from so
many Fountains made in his body; from his head, back, breast, hands, feet, nay
(in that Garden-agony) through every pore. And those, who make themselves
incapable of the benefit thereof, make, in as much as concerns them, the blood
of the Son of God who loved them and gave himself for them Gal. 2. 20. to be
shed (so grievous a crime) in vain; and this (by the Apostle) is making
themselves guilty of his murder. Heb. 6. 6. 1 Cor. 11. 27. Thus he by Gods
promise becoming the second head of the body of mankind 1 Cor. 11. 3. whereof
we by faith are members, by suffering and dying for us and in our stead, (
tasting death for every man, says the Apostle Heb. 2. 9.) he thus satisfied
Gods justice, and appeased his wrath toward us; as one member in the natural
body often suffers the punishment for the fault of some other. Sicut Homo (says
Aquinas) per aliquod opus quod manu exerceret, redimeret se a peccato quod
commisisset cum pedibus. For by this Communication of head and members Adam
brought in condemnation and death: and therefore shall not mercy be enlarged as
far as justice by the same relation, that also they may be removed? For as, if
one member suffers 1 Cor. 12. 26. all the members suffer with it; so all the
members are counted to suffer what any one does, For all the members of one
body, being many, are one body; and so is Christ 1 Cor. 12. 12. [and we]. This
is certain, the first Adam has brought no guilt or misery on his members,
which the second has not, (or shall not in due season) take away. Nay, says
the Apostle, he has taken away far more then the first brought; to wit all our
own personal guilt too. For one only sin of the first was enough to undo not
only himself but all his posterity, and to bring in death: but many millions of
sins, besides that, could not hinder the second, to procure us (notwithstanding
them) salvation and eternal life. Romans 5. 16.

Now since all our benefit by him comes from our 12.
ingrafting and incorporation into him, that so his sufferings may be accounted
for ours, the Sacrament or religious Ceremony instituted to convey Baptism
incorporating us into his death.
unto us this first effect of the second Adams dying for us, (and so freeing us
from the condemnation, and washing us with his blood from the stains of our
former sins) is Baptism. After which, tho the infirmity of concupiscence still
remain (for the benefits of the second Adam are not fully perfected till this
life is ended) yet is both the strength thereof much abated; and the reatus or
guilt thereof totally removed; i. e. that none shall be condemned for the
solicitations and importunings thereof (which will happen till our redemption
is completed) so they be by him (sor which he is enabled with sufficient
grace) mastered and suppressed. Therefore are we said in the Scripture to be
baptized The Sacrament of pardon.

in like manner did sin to his posterity. 1. For first as we derived both from
the example of Adams disobedience, and from the propagation of his flesh (a
natural soliciter even in man's innocence for its own delights, without regard

which therefore all the imperfections of theirs, (by faith) are pardoned. And

also we were sinners in Adam Romans 5. 12. as well as from Adam, in our selves by

the same spirit, i. e. of the Father; which therefore, if it have raised one,
must needs also raise the other: As we see in the living Creatures, and the
wheels Ezech. 2. 21. when those went, these went, and when those stood, these
stood, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. Or, as we may
imagine a man, of those large Dimensions, that his head were in Heaven, and his
feet on Earth, (and such is Christ and the Church Col. 2. 19. and both called

it is said that the head and members are both raised by the same spirit; so
also, that the Head shall raise and quicken the members. See Jo. 6. 39. 1 Cor.

also and souls are (according to the ancient form of the Church in the
administration of these mysteries) preserved unto everlasting life; a promise
by our Savior annexed so often to this mystical partaking of him Jo. 6. 56, 57.
etc. therefore the consecrated elements called Symbola resurrectionis, and
formerly never neglected (especially) to be received at the hour of death. For
it is to be noted that tho both the Sacraments have all the same effects;
Remission of sins, Matt. 26. 28. comp. with Act. 2. 38. Union, 1 Cor. 10. 16.
comp. with Gal. 3. 27, 28. all one in Christ Jesus. And Joh. 3. 5. comp. with 1
Cor. 12. 13. And both Sacraments do intimate obligation to suffering to the
receivers: see Matt. 20. 22, 23. where allusion doubtless is made to the two
Sacraments as 1 Cor. 12. 13. (Tho our baptism is not with blood as his; nor our
cup so bitter:) yet either of them have some more eminently then others.
Therefore Baptism (to which we have more easy access upon repentance Act. 2.
38. and faith of the truth of the Gospel Act. 8. 37. and the promise only of a
new life Matt. 3. 6, 8.) is, more principally the Sacrament of remission of
former sins Act. 2. 38. and of our profession of our death to sin; and
relinquishing the old Adam; and now putting on Christ. And then after this
cleansing from sins past by baptism, the Eucharist (to which we are to bring
not only faith and repentance, but sanctification and holiness; therefore such
examination required, see Matt. 22. 12. see 1 Cor. 11. 28. the end of 27. and
29. comp. with 1 Cor. 6. 15. converted [ shall I then take the members of an
^arlot, and make them the members of Christ?] 1 Cor. 5. 11. converted [ No
formcators presume to eat, etc. with the Saints]) is more specially the
Sacrament of our union to Christ, and living by him who is the life, by the
incorporating of his body, and blood and spirit into ours. 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17.
By which incorporation we contract such an identity (as it were) with him; that
see what he is we are. Is he a Son of God? so are we. His heir? So are we Romans
8. 17. of the Kingdom, the Glory to come: only all this by and from him; that
in all things he might have the preeminence; and amongst many bre^hren be the
first born.

But we must know, that, as all these effects of our. 16. All t^ese Benefits

Savior toward us depend on a second generation and being born again of God by
the seed of the spirit Jo. 3. 9. 2 Cor. 3. 18. Ephesians. 2. 22. -3. 16. which gives
life; as the flesh from the first Adam sows corruption, see Gal. 6. 8. 2 Cor.
3. 6. Romans 8. 11. Jo. 4. 14. Ephesians. 4. 22. and on our thus being made the true
children and offspring of Christ, Heb. 2. 13. Esa^. 53. 10, 11. So, that this
our second birth is not completed all at once: but this image of Christ by
little and little, at last is perfectly formed in us. See Gal. 4. 19. 2 Cor.
11. 2. 1 Pet. 2. 2. As also all other works of our Savior are not consummate
till his second coming and the resurrection. Else, did we walk by sight and not
by faith, how should we be transported with joy upon a vision of that infinite
glory and nobility the poor Sons of Adam receive from this their second father?
to whom be all glory for ever. And how should we sigh and groan till we were
once possessed of it? See 2 Cor. 5. 2, 4. and Romans 8. 23.

To consider therefore a little the manner and. 17.
the progress of our regeneration here in this life. Our Savior, as soon as he
had died to sin as a son of Adam, and lived again as a Son to God Romans 6. 10.

presently received this spirit, (by which he begets us) promised long before,
and therefore frequently called the promise from the Father, to communicate to
his posterity, see Luke 24. 49. Act. 1. 4. -2. 33. Ephesians. 4. 10. Jo. 7. 39. by
which spirit derived from him to us (through whom we receive all things that we
receive from God as it was from his Father to him) and therefore called also
his spirit, of Christ, of Jesus, of the Son; see Gal. 4. 6. 1 Pet. 1. 11. Act.
16. 7. vulg. Jo. 16. 7, 14. we come to be his sons. Now this spirit is not
given promiscuously to all the sons of the first Adam; nor is all the seed of
the first (by God the Father's secret will in the dispensation here and there,
of the ministry of the Gospel; and by the default of some of those that hear
it; therefore our Savior uses those limitations. Jo. 6. 44, 65. -17. 9, 11,
12.) the seed also of the second. But there is something on man's part
prerequired; (for God having given us before in our first Creation, something
we may make use of in our second, and besides this the external ministry of the
Gospel, wherewe are called to grace, tho creavit to sine te, non salvabit te
sine te) to the receiving of this spirit (I mean here in a more eminent degree
of its operations) and of our sanctification and union by it unto Christ our
Lord, and our incorporation and entrance into this heavenly lineage.

of a natural man: besides which the Apostles had another spirit searching all
things, etc. as Christ also is compounded of two natures; the Human and Divine
Act. 10. 38, yet is the one of these dying in us by degrees, as the other
grows; and we are putting off, mortifying, crucifying the one, and putting on
and renewing the other day by day. Romans 6. 6. Col. 3. 5. Gal. 6. 14. 2 Cor. 4.
16. Romans 12. 2. Ephesians. 4. 22, 23, 24. whilst there is a perpetual combat between

Gal. 5. 17. until we are perfected, which is not attained in this life. Yet
here the elder man is serving the younger; provided that we do not wither, and
fall away from grace; and die again to God. And by reason of this double
(outward and inward) man that is in us; it is that the Apostles, where they
tell us that we are dead to sin, etc. yet exhort us also to die to sin, see Romans
6. 2. comp. 12. 1 Pet. 4. 1. comp. 1 Pet. 2. 11. and that the Saints where they
give thanks, do also pray for a deliverance.

Now in this our renovation made by certain steps. 20. By this spirit the image
of Christ first formed in the soul.
and degrees, this spirit derived from Christ operateth and produces the image
of Christ first in our soul; and then afterward in our body. After the same
manner as it was in Christ himself; who first had grace in his soul with
passibility in his body till he died; after which that also was glorified by
the same spirit. Here therefore it begins in this life by its mighty working

spirit, which are fulfilled in part upon our Saviors first coming, yet seem not

but upon this (as upon our Saviors) not till the blessed Resurrection, when we
shall begin to bear the image of the heavenly Adam as we now bear the image of
the earthly, 1 Cor. 15. 49. and this vile body shall be changed, and made like
to his glorious body; like it, I mean not, as it appeared after his rising
again, to his Disciples, with a wound to thrust ones hand in, eating and
drinking, etc. (where to show the truth of his resurrection, that it was the
same body that was crucified, he was glad to veil the glory of it.) But as it

his sufferings gave them an anticipated sight of that glory, which in the
apparitions after his Resurrection was necessary to be eclipsed: upon which
moment of Beatifick vision, his transported Disciples quite forgetting all
former relations to the world would gladly have set up there their perpetual
abode. Or as it appeared to St. John, Rev. 1. 13, 17. at the sight of whose

is produced in the body as well as the soul, then it is that we are properly
called the Sons and children of God; being the children of the resurrection,
Luke 20. 36. as is also noted of our Savior. And as the Angels from their
spirituality like God are called his Sons, Job. 1. 6. So, is at that time said
to be our adoption. Romans 8. 23. The regeneration; the restitution to the state

Christ, to be hid with Christ in God. Col. 3. 3, 4. 1 Jo. 5. 11. For this state
was such a longing of the Apostle to attain once the resurrection; such a
waiting of the Saints for the coming of the Lord; such a groaning and being
burdened in this earthly Tabernacle, not to be shut of it and have none; but to
be clothed upon it with another house from Heaven, see Phil. 3. 11. 1 Cor. 1.

honorable marks of his sufferings, see Rev. 1. 7. Rev. 5. 6. he appearing in

strangely changed. For we sow not in the grave that body that shall be, 1 Cor.
15. 37. no more says St. Paul then the seed we sow in the field is the flower,
or plant that comes of it (who can guess at the beautiful colors of a Tulip, by
looking on its seed?) therefore the Apostle speaks of the body raised as a
superstructure upon this, 2 Cor. 5. 4. as the seed is clothed upon by the
flower or the tree; sown then in shame, it shall come up glorious; weak, come
up in power: natural, come up spiritual. 1 Cor. 15. 42. For there are bodies
spiritual, and we know not but the Angels are such: so spiritual as that there
shall be no more belly, at least as for meats, nor no more meats for it. 1 Cor.
6. 13. As Moses and Elias here for the 40 days they enjoyed Gods presence,
needed no food. There shall be no flesh nor blood. 1 Cor. 15. 50. No heaviness,
1 Thessalonians. 4. 17. nor grosness, Luke 24. 31. Jo. 20. 19. and so no sensual
pleasure suiting to corruptible substances (of which for the most part some
foregoing pain is the parent) Luke 20. 36. what then shall we be? like Angels;
nay like the Son of God the second Adam, our Father; like him when he shall
appear in his greatest glory 1 Jo. 3. 2. but what this likeness shall be we
know not yet; nor how far the spirit shall be united to us, in similitude of
that unity which Christ's human nature now has with the deity, but as in some
kind we are now partakers, so much more then shall we be, of the divine nature,
2 Pet. 1. 4. nay filled with all the fullness of God. Ephesians. 3. 19. Glorious in

being united to us, the body of which dwells in him. Col.. 2. 9. Jo. 17. 21,

as his glory, so his sufferings, in as much as part of hers are yet behind, are

Church, to nourish and cherish her out of the love he bears to himself; for
none ever hated his own flesh. Ephesians. 5. 28. Especially the head, in which are
placed the senses for the good and defense of the whole body, that is most
sensible of any thing that happens unto it, see Act. 9. 4. and more watchful in
providing for it. Therefore is this his love to her noted to be greater, a more
merciful, faithful, compassionate love, from his being the second Adam, and

as God works in us, so we work together with God; that there is a
concatenation and conspiring of Gods grace and our will. That as this new image
of God is formed in us by his spirit, so by our endeavors; and that there is a
configuration as effected by him, so required of us. A Configuration to all his
virtuous and holy life here (many singular patterns of which are set down
before) a Configuration to his sufferings and death, Phil. 3. 10. as it is,
first in our Baptism, and for sins after Baptism ought to be in the painful

Christ's merits is only by being his members (they can be communicated to none
else); and our being members necessarily implies conformity, (in actions,
suffering, etc.) to the Head. For that one should suffer and not the other is
quite contrary to the nature of members, 1 Cor. 12. 26. and argues schism in
the body. Should any member therefore so presume on the obedience or sufferings
of the head, as that himself now needs nor suffer nor obey; such a one without
bearing its part and proportion therein, Col. 1. 24. either never was, or is
ceased to be, a true member. Christ did nothing for our salvation, which we are
not for it, in some sense, to do also our selves. Gal. 6. 14. -9. 19, 20.

Lord, much distinguished from the rest in his typical garments, who once
yearly, on the grand day of Expiation, was to enter within the Veil into the
Sanctum Sanctorum before the glory of the Lord, appearing between the Cherubims
(he first making a cloud of Incense,) and there to present and sprinkle with
his finger 7 times upon the mercy-seat it self, and seven times on the floor
before it. Lev. 16. 14. the blood of the sacrifice made for the Priest and the
people before the Lord; and to make atonement with it for the Priests, and for
all the people; and not only for them, but also for all the holy things; the
Tabernacle, the Holy Sanctuary, the Altar it self; to purge and resanctify, and
(as if God was also displeased with these for sin) to reconcile them Lev. 16.
20. with blood; to hallow them (says the Lord) from the uncleanness and
transgressions of the children of Israel in the midst of whom they remained;
Such a contagion is our sin to the whole creation. See Levit. 16. 16, 19. and
when he went in, he was to bear the names of the children of Israel engraven,
and upon his two shoulders, and again engraven like the engraving of a Signet
upon the brestplate of judgment upon his heart, [ for a memorial of them before
the Lord continually. Exodus 28. 12, 21, 29.] He was also to have engraven upon
the front of his Miter in Gold, Holiness unto the Lord. [ And it shall be upon
Aarons forehead that he may bear the iniquity of the Holy things of the
children of Israel. See Numb. 18. 1. Lev. 16. 16. And it shall be always upon
his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord. Exodus 28. 38.] And
besides these Urim and Thummim were likewise to be upon his heart; and in any
thing doubtful the people were to repair unto him, and he by Urim was to ask
counsel for them before the Lord, and according to his word they were to do.
Lastly, the benediction of the people was in a special manner conferred by him.
See Lev. 9. 22. Ecclus. 50. 5. etc. Therefore in this Ceremony twice (viz.
after the ending of the Sacrifice, and again after his coming out of the
Sanctum Sanctorum) He solemnly in Gods name blessed the people. See Lev. 9. 22,
23. Upon Aarons first solemn blessing them, fire came out from before the Lord
to abide on the Altar for ever, verse. 24.

Now what was said before of the Levitical Sacrifice. g. (...) of Priesi (...)
imperfect, decaying, and except (typically) (...).
is here to be said again of the legal Priests. They continuing sinners as well
after, as before, their consecration; and offering for their own faults, as
well as for the peoples, Heb. 5. 3. (a sinner for sinners) were in themselves
ineffectual Intercessors before God; and, as it was impossible for those
sacrifices to take away sins, so for such Priests (being sinners and daily
consorting with sinners, and free from, only some, not all defilements) to make
any atonement; but only in relation to, and as types of, the other Priest to
come, who only was without blemish, holy, undefiled, and separate from sinners.
Heb. 7. 26. Add to this that the service they did in this office, was very
incomplete; For they were not Intercessors before the Lord for all Nations, but
presented only the names of the twelve Tribes of Israel; and for them they knew
not every ones diverse confessions and requests; nor were able to make
particular recommendation of these. Or if to recommend, yet had no ability to
help subnexed to their Intercession for them: which (we shall show). is a
privilege of the true Priesthood: which is always joined with Royalty and
power. They entered into the Divine presence but once a Year, and presently came
out again, did not abide, and wait, and sit down there, to be perpetual
Advocates with God for the people. And then the place, they went into, was not
the true Sanctuary which the Lord pitched Heb. 8. 2. who, tho he is every where
in his essence, yet is he only in Heaven as his dwelling place. 1 King. 8. 39.
then hear thou in Heaven thy dwelling place. The place of the appearance of his
glory and Majesty, of his Court and Attendants; of his throne where he gives
audience unto all his Creatures, is there. But their sanctuary served only unto
the example and shadow of Heavenly things. Heb. 8. 5. And the glory in it was
but a shadow of his glory. 2 Cor. 3. 10, 11. Lastly, the Requests, they made in
it, were rather about temporal then eternal things, about present and corporal,
not future and spiritual. No new Canaans for us, no new Jerusalems; no new
eternal places of rest prepared by them; no conferring also on all the people
their Brethren, that sacerd^tal Honor to wait for ever on God in his holy
Temple, which is the complement of all our felicity. These benefits were
reserved to crown the intercessions of another High Priest, of an higher Order.

In the fullness of time therefore came the substance,. 4 This Order Expired.

of whom these were types; 1. As a Sacrifice without spot, so a sacrifice
without sin; pure, without all blemish, not a bone of him broken, unharmable,
undefiled, separate from sinners; not after a while decaying, but continuing
for ever, at this day, at this hour; The same yesterday and to day and for
ever. Heb. 7. 24, 26. -13. 8. 2. Tho thus perfect and perpetual; yet (which is

our selves: a man as we; raised up from the midst of us; of our brethren.
Deuteronomy. 18. 15. For this was altogether necessary for such an office, in which he
was to be the Representative of his brethren. Therefore the legal High Priest
appeared before the Lord, not only in his person like unto them; but with all
their names engraven upon his breast; and this (says the Text) for a memorial
of them before the Lord continually, Exodus 28. 12, 21. and therefore the
Apostle puts in the definition of an High Priest, Heb. 5. 1. [ Taken from
amongst men]. 2. Again, one 2 In the (...) thereof.
he was that was to be compassed with infirmity, (for a while at least); that
standing before the Lord he might have all compassion in him toward those, for
whom he officiated; might be the more earnest; the more constant, and diligent;
and know how more tenderly to present to the Holy Majesty the temptations, the
miseries himself had experienced; and they also might have more confidence to
commend their suits unto him, as being their brother; and once, as they,
straightened. Therefore it is a Rule, Heb. 2. 11. [ He that sanctifies and those
who are sanctified are all of one] and therefore this Priest, for as much as
the children were partakers of flesh and blood, did also himself likewise take
part of the same, v. 14. not the nature of Angels but of man, v. 16. and was
not ashamed to call them Brethren, ver. 11. and to be made like unto them in
all things, v. 17. and that for the foresaid ends; that he might be merciful,
be faithful, unto them. Heb. 2. 17, 18. -5. 1, 2. -4. 15. Besides: Before Gods
justice no intercession could be effectual without merit; (therefore mediation
of sinners for sinners profits not) nor no merit, but in a condition and nature
liable to temptations and sufferings; (at least such merit not serviceable in
the behalf of men, where his merits are not in the same kind, as their demerits
were;) and therefore there is the same reason of the humanity of our Savior,
for his being a Priest, as for his being a sacrifice. Called to this office and
anointed by God.
3. Thus being man, and man clothed with infirmity; fitted for this office; he
was not appointed by himself, but called (as other Priests were) to this
office; and anointed by God. Heb. 5. 4, 5. Heb. 3. 2. 2 Pet. 1. 17. Act. 10.
38. But far more glorified and honored in it, then any before him; God now
anointing a Priest once, and for all; Heb. 7. 28. and not to the same order, of
which the former were; (in many things, as is showed before) deficient, Of the
order of Melchisedeck, i. e. Regal and Eternal.
but to the very best, that of Melchisedeck, i. e. a Priesthood everlasting and
royal; and that had power joined with Intercession; and the honor of sitting
down by him, to whom he officiated. For this man was counted worthy of more
glory then any before, as being the builder, and afterward, upon its ruin,
rebuilder, of this house over which God thus made him Lord. Heb. 3. 3.

Thus made a Priest; now let us view the exact. 5. This Holy Priest offering
the sacrifice, a sin-offering.
discharge of his office in the several parts thereof; and first the Priests
office (for expiation of sin, etc.) being first to offer the sacrifice; and
then to carry the blood thereof into the Sanctuary, and there make an
atonement and intercession with it for the offenders. He therefore first
offered the sacrifice, a sin-offering upon the altar of the Cross, such as
never Priest offered before him: neither for the worth of it; being
all-sufficient, (never any more sin-offering required after it, nor never any
beneficial before it, but only through it): nor for the nearness and dearness of
it to the Sacrificer. Abraham, the rigidst example we have, only offering to
offer his son; But this Priest offered himself, and that voluntarily, and that
coming out of the bosom of his Father, from the glory he had with him long
before the world; i. e. coming out of the Sanctum Sanctorum to do it: (as
wanting something when he was there before (notwithstanding those rivers of
blood of Bulls and Goats that were shed before) with which to appease his
Fathers justice) out of the infinite love he bare to sinners. [ Now once, says
the Apostle, in the end of the world he appeared to put away sin by the
sacrifice of himself, Heb. 9. 26.] and that sacrifice of himself by himself
offered. See Heb. 7. 27. Ephesians. 5. 2. Jo. 10. 17, 18.

But his high, and that Melchisedechical i. e. eternal,. 6. After this entering
into the S^nctum Sanctorum
Priesthood did not so much consist in this transitory act at the Altar, which
any Priest might execute; but in the second carrying and appearing with the
blood in the Sanctum Sanctorum before the Lord, etc. only performed by the High
Priest. Therefore the Apostle places upon him Priesthood after Melchisedecks
order; which could not be till he was King as well as Priest; not till after he
was first risen from the dead, and made perfect (at which time also he was made
King and Lord) when ascended and made higher then the Heavens, he had now no
more conversation with sinners; was harmless, i. e. no more to be hurted;
undefiled, i. e. that needed not to intermit, for this at any time, his office.
See Heb. 7. 26. when, as before he had become weak, suffered and dyed for us,
so now he lived for evermore; and was set down on the Majesty on high, in the
Sanctuary which the Lord had pitched; and there had received all power, to
help, to protect us; all gifts to shower down upon us. We have such an High
Priest (says he): Such an High Priest becomes us. In this was his honor and
glory above all Priests before him: and in this the certainty of our Salvation;
when he is not only the meritorious cause, but the efficient; nor only the
price, but Author of it. See Heb. 5. 4, 5. comp. 9. Heb. 5. 5. comp. Act. 13.
33. and Ps. 2. 7. comp. 8. ask of me, etc. Heb. 5. 9, 10. being made perfect,
called etc. Heb. 6. 20. forerunner, made etc. See Heb. 8. 1, 2, 4. and 7. 26.
Ps. 110. 4. comp. Without which his office had been imperfect and ineffectual.
1, 2. Heb. 8. 6. such a ministry following such a mediatorship.) Our Saviors
death perfected his Oblation indeed but not his office; nor, our Salvation. And
it is since that, that he daily procures, as we repent and believe, the
application of the meritorious sacrifice to us, which he then made for us; and
we are said no less to be saved by the sprinkling of his blood, which is done
in the sanctuary now continually; then by the shedding of it which was done on
the Cross. See Heb. 12, 24. ^ Pet. 1. 2. Heb. 9. 19, 23. -13. 12. The price of
our redemption was then laid down sufficient to satisfy justice, but not yet
carried in and accepted by grace: (for tho the sacrifice was sufficient for
all, yet it is effectual only to some [i. e. Believers]; for whom as it was
provided at first by mere grace, so by mere grace the satisfaction thereof
(being none of theirs) is to them applied, Heb. 2. 9. (from whence Gods free
grace, notwithstanding our Saviors merits, is so often put for the cause of our
Salvation, see Romans 4. 4, 16.) before the throne of which grace he now went to
appear with it. But then many things there are, besides the expiation of sins
past, also necessary for the completing of our salvation; which we are said to
owe chiefly to our Saviors intercession: therefore, as we find our
justification and remission of our sins (committed before our conversion)
ordinarily imputed to Christ's death and resurrection; so, our salvation; all
the strengthening of us in our new life; that abundance of grace whereby we now
serve God; our consolation and protection in all afflictions, from all our
enemies, in the service of him; the remission of our sins, when after baptism
and conversion relapsing into any faults, etc. are ascribed to our Saviors
living evermore in this office of intercession, and to his sitting now at Gods
right hand with all power. See 1 Jo. 2. 1. Romans 5. 10. -8, 31. yea rather that
he is now at the right hand, etc. and who now can separate? for he is able to
the uttermost. Heb. 7. 21. Jo. 14. 10. This, that we may not so look on the
past benefits of our Savior, as not also to acknowledge, give thanks, and
rejoice in his present service for us; (which remainder of service to be
performed after his passion he seems to intimate in that somewhat obscure
speech to Mary Magdalene. Jo. 20. 17. Touch me not for I am not yet, etc. i. e.
the time of embraces and your full enjoyment of me is not (as you suppose it
is) yet come, see Rev. 19. 7. for all my business is not done, etc.) and may
behave our selves as gratefully toward one from whom we have received so rich
favors; so also dutifully toward one, on whom we depend for more.

Now then to view in order the several offices this. 7. He entering (through the
heavens) to the true sanctuary. The vail of the other being now rent and it

High Priest after his sacrificing did and does for us: First then (the Holy
Priest entering into the Sanctum Sanctorum through the vail) so the flesh of the
Son of God, being a vail, Heb. 10. 20. which contained within it, and hid, his
Deity, was then rent, and this Holy Priest now through it, Heb. 9. 12. reentred
into his former Majesty and glory before covered by it. Again upon the renting
of this vail, Matt. 27. 50, 51. presently that in the Temple, that severed the
Holy from the most holy, place, was rent also; by which, (the place within
being now laid open and made common) was signified both a voiding of that
former service of the Levitical HighPriesthood; and that the way was now
admitted for this new Priest, having already slain his sacrifice, Heb. 9. 8.
into another true Sanctuary, into a Sanctuary of the Lords own erecting, not at
all made with hands; Higher then the heavens; to which sanctuary he passed through
the outer Tabernacle of these (which likewise was not made with hands) see Heb.
8. 2. -7. 26. -9. 11, 24. of which supercelestial sanctuary both that which was
pitched by Moses, and 1 The description of this Sanctuary.
that built by Solomon were representations; figures, examples, shadows, Heb.
9. 23, 24. -8. 5. both made; one according to the pattern showed to Moses in
the Mount, where Moses saw God as in a Sanctuary: See Ps. 68. 17. And God is
said to descend upon it: Exodus 34. 5. -33. 21. as afterward upon the other, in
a cloud to speak with Moses; the other to David 1 Chronicles. 28. 19. in a design.
Of which heavenly Sanctuary we may have a divine sight a far-off from the
several visions and apparitions of Gods glory: both those in the old Testament,
see Esai. 6. 1. Ezech. 1. 4. -10. 1. etc. and those in the new to St. John. For
it is worth the noting that not only Gods glory on the Mount to Moses, Ps. 68.
17. but in the heavens to St. John, appeared still as in a Temple, or

Having thus made a description of the place, (the. 8. 2 Of his person entering.
heavenly Sanctuary and the propiatory or throne of grace there, over the Ark
compassed with 4 Cherubims, etc.) according as the Lord Jesus was pleased to
represent it to St. John: Here first now let us imagine to enter and present
himself this great High Priest soon after his work finished upon the Altar of
the Cross; such as he is described, Heb. 7. 26. Holy, unharmable, undefiled,
separate from sinners, needing no washing first, as the Legal did; arrayed with
all the truth and substance of those things, which were typified by the

[pure and never stained] unto the Lord, that so his holiness may bear the
iniquities of our holy things, and we in and by it may be accepted before the
Lord (he being made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and
redemption. Numb. 18. 1. Exodus 28. 38. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Romans 5. 19.) appearing
again a Priest with the restord Urim and Thummim Ezra 2. 63. upon his heart,

book of all Gods secrets, and showing them, as he pleases, to his Brethren,

hears and receives from him. thus passing through the outer Sanctuary of the
heavens, Heb. 9. 11. whilst it is proclaimed before him, Behold the Lamb of
God, etc. my servant whom I have chosen: my Beloved in whom my soul is well
pleased, Let us imagine him, I say, in such equipage to appear in this Sanctum
Sanctorum before that Mercy-Seat, that throne of grace, and to appear in the
presence of God there, not for himself, but for us, says the Apostle, Heb. 9.
24. -8. 1. for himself had that glory there with his Father before the world
was, and came down out of his bosom for this purpose (for he that would ascend
thus must be such a one that descended first) that he might return thither with
these new engagements upon him, with a great many names besides his own, new
relations and new kindred, entering in thither now for his poor Brethren.

Thus entered, first into this Sanctuary he carries. 9 (...) in the sacrifice.
with him not only the blood, but the whole sacrifice, being restored unto him,
(after he had offered it as an entire Holocaust, and poured out all the blood
thereof at the foot of the Altar) to offer it here a second time to the
acceptance of his Father. See Heb. 8. 3. comp. 9. 7. carries it with all the
wounds, and piercings made in it as honorable marks of his sufferings, and
remembrances thereof to his Father, (which it is probable that his glorified
body still retains); appearing in his Father sight a Lamb as it had been slain.
See Rev. 5. 6. as also he appeared before for confirming the faith of his
Disciples, Jo. 20. 27. to which the Apostle alludes, Gal. 6. 17. and (likely)
shall appear at the last day, to the everlasting reproach of his enemies. See
Rev. 1. 7. In memory whereof also the very Altar (the Cross) is imagined to be
that, which is called the sign of the son of man, Matt. 24. 30. and which shall
appear in the heavens, and be carried before as his royal Ensign in his
procession to the last judgment. Which Sacrifice since he appoints here (in the
consecrated elements) to be showed forth by his Priests in our Sanctuaries
before God, in commemoration of him; how much more in that above is it
solemnized for us by himself our High Priest? That as the bow was set in the
Cloud, that God looking upon it might remember his Covenant, and forbear to
bring a second deluge upon the earth, Genesis 9. 16. and the blood of the Paschal
Lamb was stricken on the door posts, that the Lord seeing it there might pass
over them with his plague; So when he beholds these wounds, (given our Savior
for our sin) displaid before him, he may forbear to revenge sin any more upon
his Brethren. And if Pilate showing that our suffering Savior with an Ecce Homo
thought the beholding such a pitiful and cruel spectacle was enough to have
melted the hardhearted Jews his malicious enemies into some mercy and
compassion, so as to prosecute his death no further: How much more will such a
pale and wanner sight, as was seen afterward upon the Cross, of an only Son
voluntarily undergoing all this for our sin, move a pitiful and merciful father
no further to prosecute the vengeance thereof upon his brethren, upon his own
members? A second Action there is sprinkling of his blood upon, and before, the
Mercy-Seat, not And sprinkling the blood before the Lord.
7, nor 77 times, but continually: and note that all bloodshed, when it comes
before the Lord, has a loud cry. See the blood of the Saints, Rev. 6. 10. And
Abels. Genesis 4. 10. And the Apostle compares the sprinkling of our Saviors
blood, for its speaking and crying, unto the sprinkling of Abel's, tho His
cried not the same way; for it pleaded for mercy as the other for vengeance.
For we receive a true atonement, are sanctified, are purifyed (as many of us
as serve the Lord) by the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus. See 1 Pet. 1. 2.
Heb. 12. 24. -13. 12. [Not that our Savior there really sprinkled his blood for
us, let none grossly imagine this, for flesh and blood enter not into heaven, 1
Cor. 15. but that he now by it (poured out by him on the Cross,) in the
heavenly Sanctuary procures all the effects, obumbrated by the former
sprinkling of the blood of the legal Sacrifices.] Therefore it is observed that
the Apostle says he entered by it, not with it. Heb. 9. 12, 23. Who is
therefore called, for this Celestial ceremony before the propitiatory, or
throne of grace, our (...) propitiation. 1 Jo. 2. 2. and our (...)
propitiatory. Romans 3. 25. Thus he sprinkled his blood to make atonement for,
and to sanctify, us; but, as we read that the legal High Priest purified also
the Sanctuary it self, and reconciled the Holy place (said to be defiled by
being in the midst of the peoples uncleanness. See Lev. 18. 25, 28.) the
Apostle makes this also run parallel for our Savior, Heb. 9. 23. by which, as
is signified the purifying of all the Creatures and particularly of all our
imperfect holy services unto us, so perhaps something more may yet be gathered
from, Col. 1. 16, 20. -2. 10. Job. 15. 15. -4. 18. -25. 5. 2 Pet. 3. 7, 12.
Romans 8. 22. well considered: for all Principalities and Thrones, i. e. Angels,
were made by him at first, and for him: and by him they now consist; and of
them also he is the head; and by him they are said to be reconciled; through him
they are now confirmed in grace, and perhaps at the last day through him shall be
advanced in glory; And perhaps the upper regions of the world may be said in
some sense to be contaminated (as the earth) by man's, or the fallen Angels sin:
to which heavenly things also the vanity, bondage, groaning of the Creatures
mentioned Romans 8. may extend; which also are said by Peter to be reserved, and
that they shall be dissolved, and, as it were, purified by fire. But abscondita
Domino Deo nostro, manifesta nobis.

People, whose making atonement was not without prayer, since this also is
called making atonement. Exodus 32. 30. and so where we translate making

Israel; see Job. 42. 8. Genesis 20. 7. which appears also by the continual
practice of the Priests and Prophets praying for the people. Jer. 7. 16. -27.

continually his own prayers to the Father for us; in which respect he is
called also (...) our Advocate with the Father; as well as the Holy Ghost is
called (...) the Advocate to the Father here on earth with, or in us: (As the
spirit is also styled by his title of Intercessor, here; as he there, Romans 8.
26, 27.) and therefore what office in prayer, when any one sins or suffers,
this Advocate does here on earth residing with us, 1 Jo. 5. 7, 8. see Romans 8.
26. the other Advocate does the same in heaven, residing with the Father and
with the same unexpressible zeal. The better to conceive which, imagine Aaron,
Numb. 16. 47. when wrath was gone out from the Lord, standing with his Censer
in his hand between the living and the dead, and staying the plague: or Moses,
that great type of him, Deuteronomy. 18. 15. like unto me, his pathetical
intercessions, and deprecations so many times for the sinning Israelites:
continuing 40 days at a time with the Lord in supplication for them and for
their Priest, see Exodus 32. comp. with Deuteronomy. 9. 18, 20. Numb. 14. 13. etc. and
proceeding even to wishing himself accu^ed in their stead (as also did St.
Paul, but our Savior only was he that really became also a curse for others)
and then be sure our High Priest now makes the same; nay far greater; as much
more concerned in our safety, being Master over the house, in which Moses, tho
a faithful, yet was but, a servant. The exact matter and manner of whose
intercessions above, tho it is not manifested unto us, yet what esteem of it
and confidence in it may we not have? [therefore our Mother the Church thinks
fit to finish all her prayers in it] if we consider, first that infinite love
wherewith he now loves us. (How can it be silent!) Ephesians. 3. 19. from which
neither things present, nor things to come, neither heights nor depths, etc.
can ever separate us. Romans 8. 38, 35. comp. with 34. 2. The promises which he
made in that last comforting Sermon immediately before his death and departure
from hence; the sum of which is to assure his Disciples, and consequently all
believers, see Jo. 17. 20. of the great care he would take for them in heaven;
where also he particularly promises to pray the Father for them, who was
greater then he, [and therefore they might rejoice they had such a friend with
him, see Jo. 14. 16, 28. -16. 7, 26.] tho he assured them of his Fathers great
affection to them for his sake, even in case himself should not pray for them.
3. His long (many whole nights) and assiduous practices of prayer here on
earth, (doubtless for them and us,) tho importuned with so much other business.
S. Peter's sudden repentance and tears, Matt. 26. 75. came from his
intercession, Luke 22. 32. 4. If we consider the matter of that (one only long)
prayer of his, that is set down, Jo. 17. after his work was finished here; and
he was to leave his Disciples here on earth to the custody of his Father. Ver.
12, 13. And, some part of his Church now and till the end of the world having
the same necessities; Many sheep that were not of that fold, of whom he says
also that he must bring them in, Jo. 10. 16. How can he not continue for them
the same petitions, till he be made complete also in the whole Church his body?
Neither prayed he then for his Apostles alone, but for them also that should
believe on him through their word, verse. 20. for our sanctification, verse. 17. for
our perfecter union with him and the Father in this world, verse, 11. 21. for
our glorification with him in heaven, verse. 24. Perfectly knowing every ones

sins, procuring remission, 1 Jo. 2. 1. and infinitely pitying every ones
condition. An Advocate as any one of his is tempted and afflicted, procuring
succor, and watching that their suffering may not be beyond their ability,
Heb. 2. 18. and perfectly foreseeing all their dangers. An Advocate begging
deliverance from future evils; as he did here on earth for Peter, when Satan
would have sifted him [ but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not]
Luke 22. 23. and going away; for his Disciples left behind: [ Father I desire
not to have them quite taken out of the world, but keep thou them in it from
the evil, verse. 15. from their powerful and invisible enemy, and from all those
wolves among among whom I leave them. Think we then the Shepherd of Israel now
sleeps? But we must not let this pass un noted; That his Intercession who is
always heard, (for he asks according to the will of God, Romans 8. 27.) never
asks such things, as God has decreed by no prayers to be exorable in; As to
be capable of his mercies and favors, there are some dispositions prerequisite
in the person. See Ezekiel. 14. 3, 5, 14. For such therefore, as want these, our
Savior perfectly knowing his Fathers will can ask nothing absolutely, that is
against it. Tho with a velleity (if you will) now, (as when he prayed in the
Garden for himself, or for his enemies when on the Cross, Luke 23. 34.) he
desires or wishes mercy even for all, even for those who shall never receive
any. Velleity I say, qua hoc vellet, si aliud non obsisteret, but his
intercession with an absolute will (which is always conform to his Fathers,
and so always fulfilled by his Father) is not general and for all; (so we
might think it frustrated) but for those that are, or will be rightly disposed,
and are, or are to be, of his Church; (even as the High Priest carried in
before the Lord only the names of the twelve Tribes.) I pray for them, says
he, I pray not for the world, Jo. 17. 9. not for those, who have the devil for
their Father, 1 Jo. 3. 8. not for the man of sin, and those persecutors of his
Church; Against whom we may imagine he now deprecates his Father in behalf of
the Church, in that form, Rev. 6. 10. How long Lord, etc. Ps. 44. 9, 17. and
Zech. 1. 12. How long, etc. which Angel was the Son of God: and receives from
him that answer in the Psalmist. Ps. 110. 1. Sit thou on my right hand, till I
make, etc. whom he will at last utt^rly destroy at his coming; for there is a
sin we may not, therefore neither does he, pray for. 1 Jo. 5. 16. And this much
more indears his intercessions unto his, since they are not common for all; and
let us take heed least there be in any of us an heart of unbelief, Heb. 3. 12.
either not to enter at all, or to run out of, this fold; either not to be
ingrafted into, or to be cut off from, his body; and so be made incapable and
loose our share of such dear intercessions and omnipotent prayers, by virtue of
which it is not possible for the elect to miscarry. Matt. 24. 24.

glory unto him; and Free-will-offerings, our restraint of some lawful liberty,
when this any way conducing more to his service; and whole burnt-offerings, our
resignation and dedicating of all we have and are to the promoting of his
glory. So our prayers are called Incense, and the morning and evening
Sacrifice. Rev. 5. 8. Ps. 141. 2. Our praise the calves of our lips. See Heb.
13. 15. comp. with Hos. 14. 2. Ps. 50. 14, 15. preferred before all the Herds
on the Mountains; all our words and actions, even to our eating and drinking,
required to have a special dedication to God. Col. 3. 17. 1 Cor. 10. 31. And as
all our actions, that are by the soul, so all our passions and sufferings, that
are by the body, are sacrifices too, and much more properly such, then the
former; so both those mortifications and crucifyings of the flesh by our
selves, whether for the wiping away, or for the prevention of sin, and killing
of our brutish lusts now instead of slaying of beasts, or our patient and
contented undergoing those sent from God for sin, are no mean sacrifices: see
Ps. 51. 16, 17. Thou delights not, etc. The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, etc. And those sufferings in the flesh
from others, (for righteousness sake, or for the glory of God, or for the
benefit of our Brethren,) when we instead of the blood of Beasts, offer up our
own to God; and undergo Martyrdom for his sake, this is the highest sacrifice
of all, and so St. Paul calls his. 2 Timothy 4. 6. Phil. 2. 17. 2 Cor. 12. 15. And
these sufferings also our Savior presents to God, as he does those of his own
body; for we also are his body, and as he offers up himself, so us, to the
Father. Tota congregatio societasque sanctorum, universale sacrificium offertur
deo per sacerdotem magnum. Aug. Civ. Dei l. 10. And as spending of our lives
for God and our Brethren; so the spending of our Estates; all our Alms, and
charities are Evangelical Gifts, and Oblations, and Sacrifices (therefore many
times anciently made by Christians at the Altar.) See Heb. 13. 16. Phil. 4. 18.
[ I have received, etc. the things that were sent from you an odor of a sweet
smell, a sacrifice acc^ptable, etc.] All our doings, then, and all our
spendings; our souls and our bodies, Romans 12. 1. the spending of our lives and
of our estates; all these make up one complete Holocaust, which we owe unto God
under the Gospel; (of which those under the Elements of the world were types,
and in which they are fulfilled;) after that our Savior had first begun to us;
and sacrificed, instead of Beasts, himself. 1 Pet. 2. 5. Col. 1. 24. Now these
the peoples sacrifices under the Gospel, as those under the Law, must of
necessity have a Priest to offer them for the reason mentioned: not only
because they are so nothing worth, the best we can bring of them; and so
unprofitable when we have done all we can; and God so self all-sufficient
without them; whose offerings to him whatever are only his gifts to us 1 Chronicles.
29. 14. (all of us but our sins being his;) but because, by contagion of sin in
us they are also all unclean (for who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean? Job. 14. 4.) and he so pure and so holy; that we are in the same
condition as Uzziah 2 Chronicles. 26. 18. or Nadab and Abihu, unless there be one to
bear the iniquity of our holy things, and through whose merits toward God, and
Gods love unto him, they may be accepted. To whom, methink, God speaks as
Moses. Exodus 19. Do thou come up, etc. but let not the people, least I break
forth upon them. And unto us as disguised Joseph did to his brethren; see not
my face unless you bring your Brother with you. Or as God to to the Friends of
Job. 42. c. 8. v. Take with you a sacrifice and go to my servant Job, and my
servant Job shall pray for you, for him I will accept; or as to Abimelech
concerning Abraham. Genesis 20. 7. He is a Prophet and he shall pray for thee, and
thou shall live. For these intercessors were set down for types of this supreme
Mediator.

By our Savior therefore all these our Sacrifices. 12.
must be offered, or by us in his name, which is all one, Phil. 1. 11. and
that, not only our prayers and petitions, where we need and ask something, that
they may be heard through Jesus Christ our Lord; but our giving of thanks and
glory to God; (Alas what glory can we give?) where we present something, that
they may be accepted. We then first come to him; and he offers them for us: so
we are said to praise, to give thanks, to give glory to God, by him. See Heb.
13. 15. Romans 1. 8. Col. 3. 17. 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. Therefore he styles himself the
way to the Father. Jo. 14. 6. and the door Jo. 10. 9. through which we must pass.
And to God be glory in the Church by Christ. Ephesians. 3. 21. The tongue being in

3. But thirdly, he not only presents and delivers our. 13. 3 In procuring our

petitions for us, etc. but he has procured for us free admission to the
Father, to deliver them our selves; not in a body by presence indeed as yet,
but by the spirit; Ephesians. 2. 18. and sent us unto the Father to ask any thing in
his name; see Jo. 16. 23, 24, 26, 27. (according to which the Church directs
her prayers not to him (as he says verse. 23.) but to the Father) telling us
that the Father himself for his sake, loves us, verse. 27. Ephesians. 1. 6. Romans 8.
39. love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. In this far outdoing the
mediation under the law, where Moses indeed went up, but the people were railed
out, and trembling and quaking stood afar off: which preeminence of us the
Apostle often intimates in the Epistles. Heb. 12. 17. By him therefore now we
also are said to draw nigh unto God; to have access to the Father; access with
boldness; to come boldly unto the throne of grace; into the Holiest, Heb. 10.
19, 22. all our words and works to be accepted, if done in his name, etc. See
Heb. 4. 16. Ephesians. 5. 20. Heb. 7. 19, 25. Ephesians. 2. 18. -3. 12. Col. 3. 17. And for
these causes abovesaid it is, that the Church so often in all Divine service
repeats that holy dear name; and St. Paul ('it is noted) in his Epistles above
500 times; because to, by* through, and in Him and his name are all things, said
and done, and to be done, that are well and acceptably done. Which name be it
blessed for ever.

4. After these acts of this High Priests intercession,. 14. The benefits of
his intercession.
let us now proceed to the fruits and benefits thereof. And first. As the legal
High Priest first after he had offered the sacrifice, and again after he had
carried in the blood into the Holiest, blessed and put Gods name upon the
people. Lev. 9. 22. etc. Numb. 6. 27. So our Savior (answerable to the first)
before Procuring us the Holy Spirit from the Father.
he went into the Sanctuary, Luke 24. 50, and at other times blessed his
people; and (answerable to the second) also does it since his going in
(blessing us from it, because, by his everlasting Priesthood needing to make no
more offerings, he is not to come out of it, till the consummation of all
things; when he will yet in a more transcendent manner give us his blessing:)
See Act. 3. 26. and what the blessing, that he sent us, was, see Act. 2. 33.
Upon whose blessing us from above, that fire Act. 2. 2. descended upon the
Apostles, and consequently upon his Church ever since; of which that material
one which came out from before the Lord upon And all blessings spiritual and
temporal.
Aarons first blessing was a type, Lev. 9. 24. Imagine him then (first) now
speaking from Heaven, putting his Fathers name upon us, and pronouncing that
form, Numb. 6. 24. and then after it, all those spiritual and temporal
blessings and deliverances of his Church here, showred down by him; but above
all that fire of the Holy Spirit for ever burning upon the Altar of our hearts,
and hallowing all our sacrifices, and elevating them unto God; the manifold
gifts and graces of which are mentioned elsewhere. Only here take notice, 1. Of
the time of their collation; and that was after his being ascended, and entered
into the Sanctuary and having interceded there. See Jo. 7. 39. -16. 7. Act. 2.
33. Ephesians. 4. 7, 8. Jo. 14. 28, 29. So that we have and do receive far gre^ter
advantages by his absence and service there, then we could by his corporal
presence here; (Blessed be God by whose wisdom all things serve for our good!)
as also appears in his Disciples; far more expert in knowledge; powerful Himse^f
im^ con^ them (...).
in working, (according to the promise Jo. 14. 20.) after his departure. 2. Of
the manner of their conveyance (which will much advance our confidence, if we
consider our near relation.) For we receive them not by his procurement only
from the Father, but even from his own hand. Every good and perfect gift comes
from the Father, etc. Jam. 1. 17. but through, and by immediate donation of the
Son; and by the same way as all our prayers and sacrifices ascend, and enter
in, blessings come forth of, this Sanct^ary. Upon his asking all things are
given him, Psalm. 2. 8. (whom the Father always hears) and at his own pleasure
he dispenses them. Act. 2. 33. ^ph. 1. 3. And this, the having in his own
power the gift of all things (from whose hands we may be sure we shall want
nothing) belongs peculiarly to the tenure of his Priesthood; being

joined with Kingship, Sacerdotium Regale, or Sacerdotale regnum, i. e. having
royalty and power joined with it; as before the law these two were joined in
the Princes of families, so after the law they are united in Christ, a King
over all; but Him, whom, as a Priest, he serves. Therefore we find him sitting

frequently joined with his Priesthood and intercession; for to show the
everlasting power of his Priesthood. See Heb. 8. 1. Romans 8. 34. Ps. 110. 1.

intercession, he is able to save (says the Apostle) not willing only, Heb. 7.

Savior, (by the same Apostle in his treatise of his Priesthood) is called the

of the household of God; and conducter of them into a promised place of rest,
and forerunner entered before them into Heaven, as it is the land of promise;

of Satan and sin; and passing through the Red Sea of Baptism, 1 Cor. 10. 2. yet,
as in the Wilderness; a dry and thirsty land where no water is (as the Psalmist
spiritually complains of it, see Psalm. 63. 1. -39. 12. -119. 19. whoever take
it for any thing else much mistake it) now under Christ (I speak of him
according to his manhood) our Conductor; as they were under Moses and Joshua:)
and all things that were done there were examples. 1 Cor. 10. 6, 11. First
therefore as Moses, [when the mount of God burnt with fire, nothing but
blackness, and darkness, and tempest; nothing but wrath and judgment toward
us, and fear least the fire of the Lord should break forth upon us, having all
sinned as Israel had, and none durst draw near to speak for us.] Behold him
coming forth out of the midst of us (the true Mediator) and going for us into
the Mount; and there like Moses, Exodus 32. 30. making an atonement for us. And
tho there is yet to come another shaking of all things, shaking heaven and
earth and all in pieces under this second Moses, Heb. 12. 26. far more terrible
then that under the first; wherein he shall come in judgment to destroy his
enemies, from which then there shall be no Mediator to hinder him, as Exodus 32.
10, 11. yet then to those that obey him, this Mount Sinai shall be changed into
Mount Sion, and the city of the living God, etc. see Heb. 12. 22. etc. where
are such and such glorious company. And thither shall he also carry up his
Brethren after the remainder of the 40 days, or 6 weeks of his abode there are
expired. Meanwhile from thence, not from an higher place of the earth, but from
the highest heaven into which he is gone up, he continually speaks unto us not
with that terror as the Angels from Mount Sinai gave the law, but with the soft
voice of his spirit, the ministration of which by him is opposed to that of the
law by Moses. 2 Cor. 3. 8, 9. And woe be to all them, that refuse to hear him
far beyond those that refused to hear Moses. Heb. 12. 25. -10. 29. 2. And then,
as resembled by 2 To Joshua.
Joshua or Jesus, (called so as a type of him) he is the Conductor also of the
people of God into the true land of promise, Heb. 4. 8. the place of rest; the
rest of God. Heb. 4. 5. Into which God has sworn no unbelievers shall enter.
And into this our blessed Savior is entered already before us, and set down (the
posture of resting) at the right hand of God; entered not only as a forerunner
Heb. 6. 20. or leader; to give an example, that we should follow him thither;
the Anchor of our hope being already cast within the veil, by the taking
possession of this our forerunner. Heb. 6. 19, 20. But also a forerunner or And

there to prepare a place for us, Jo. 14. 2, 3. in that house where are many
mansions (the heavens that we see, being but a center to it, from whence God
looks down upon them as they upon the earth, Ps. 113.) not any therefore, but
an honorable, a choice place there; see Rev. 4. 4. where the Churchmen were
sitting on either side of Gods Throne in the midst of all the glorious train of
Heaven, and the Angels standing in a circle about them. Rev. 5. 11. -7. 11.]

Rev. 16. 4. -7. 15. -3. 4. And from thence after this place prepared for us,
and us for it, he has promised to come again and accompany us thither in
person. (Thus is he a forerunner to all the faithful, in respect of their
bodies entering into that celestial Canaan; he being the firstborn from the
dead: but again forerunner (according to the opinion of antiquity) of the souls
too; entering into the heavenly Sanctuary, in respect of the spirits not only of
all Saints dying since him (of this no question,) but of all those that
deceased before him from the beginning; the very first into this Sanctuary; as
none ever entered (for the cause) but by, and in relation to, him; so none (for
the time) before him; which opinion seems to be strengthened from the
expressions of our Savior concerning Lazarus. That He i. e. his soul. (as Luke
21. 43. this day shall thou i. e. thy soul) was carried by Angels into Abraham's
bosom, as being Father of the faithful; a place of bliss doubtless, [being
opposed to the other's place of torment,] wherein Lazarus received
consolations; but now we are said to be gathered unto Christ after this life;
we, and Abraham, and all into Christ's bosom ours, and Abraham's, Father. See 2

the Messiah; but also of those obtained through him spoken of, verse. 13, 14, 16.

their own prayers for the people; and also the peoples prayers to God; through
Christ. For God accepts no prayers but through Christ; nor yet all those that
are made in Christ's name; except either they come from persons deputed by him,
who is so dearly loved; to which persons God has made extraordinary promises,
as those (I conceive) are Matt. 18. 18, 19. Jo. 16. 23. etc. or from those that
are holy and like unto him; For sinners God hears not, till reformed. The
emploiment of the Saints in heaven, as we have any notice of it, is prayer and
praises. For first, since the spirits of Saints departed hence are in paradise,
Luke 23. 43. and with Christ Phil. 1. 23. are now said to be made perfect, Heb.
12. 23. and clothed with white garments, Rev. 6. 11. that is advances in
charity and purity greater then here; are described in Priests habits, having

St. John to be prayers of the Saints, Rev. 5. 8, -8. 3. have a zeal to Gods
glory in men's salvation beyond ours, or their own whilst on earth; and more
charity, which grace is not decayed by death, but perfected. 1 Cor. 13. 8. 2.
Since their interpellations there can prejudice our Saviors no more, then the
Priests intercessions here, 1 Timothy 2. 1. and if any ask what needs theirs, we
may as justly reply, what need these; nay what need any prayers at all; see
Matt. 6. 8. Tho little concerning this their interpellation is revealed; and
those Christians, who have implored it, seeming to have grounds partly on
Miracles pretended to be done by them; But (probably) true ones done and that
frequently at their memorials. See Austin. Civit. Dei lib. 22. cap. 8. and
partly on pretended apparitions of them, after deceased; yet in general it
seems piously credible, that as Christ's members on earth now suffer, as he did
on earth; so his members in heaven intercede for these sufferers (at least in
general) as he does there; and echo unto the King of Heaven the words of their
Master, as the Angels do to the Church. Rev. 5. 12. comp. with 9. Rev. 7. 11,

the public assemblies; but even all the people of God in comparison of the
rest of the world; the Church being a chosen generation out of all the rest; an
holy Nation; a Kingdom of Priests; Gods peculiar treasure, the Israel of God,
separated and sanctified for to serve him. See Exodus 19. 5, 6. Gal. 6. 16. 1
Pet. 2. 5, 9. Rev. 1. 6. Every one of whom, not only by the Priest, (in
public assemblies,) but by themselves also, (in their hearts) may offer
sacrifices immediately to God the Father, acceptable through Jesus Christ, Heb. 7.
19. and hence are we also called, not only Priests by whom, but Temples also;
and that not our souls only but our bodies (inhabited by Gods spirit; as that
Ancient one was by his Glory,) in whom, such sacrifice is offered; (as our
Saviors body also (more eminently) was styled a Temple. See Jo. 2. 21. 1 Cor.

expressions, commanding us to depend and cast our hope on the expectation of
the coming of Christ in glory at the last day; and deferring the receipt of our
salvation, of the reward, and of the crown of glory, etc. till that time. See
Luke 14. 14. 2 Timothy 4. 8. -1. 12, 16, 18. 1 Pet. 1. 5, 13. 2 Pet. 3. 11, 12.

that there is a place not to be entered before Christ's second coming, prepared

expectation of these souls. Rev. 6. 9, 10, 11. From the just punishments of

2. Some at least it seems dwelling in the Air, and not yet cast into the

probable that some souls attain not so much bliss, and glory, and privilege as
some others. See Rev. 20. 4. comp. 5. -14. 4. Nor perhaps so much security (I
mean not in respect of damnation) but in respect, of that severe trial, which
shall be at that dreadful day: and of the measure of their salvation, bliss,

day, which shall not amount to the condemnation of (...) (by which our Savior
expresses hell here, Matt. 5. 22. as frequently elsewhere. See verse. 29. Matt.
25. 33.) see Matt. 5. 22. comp. Matt. 12. 36. And since of those, who shall be
saved in that day: yet this salvation shall be much more difficultly attained
by some then others. 1 Cor. 3. 15. It cannot be imagined that the state of all
the souls of those, who rest in peace, are alike blissful in the interval
between death and judgment: or equally comforted, of some of whom such a severe
examen is afterward to be passed. It cannot be, that such a difference of the
salvandi being to be in judgment, there should be none before it; nor the same
soul so much in bliss at one time as some other, see Rev. 20. 4. -14. 1. -7. 4,
9, 14, 15. comp. Rev. 6. 10, 11. Yet it seems plain, I say, that the soul in
general, severed from the body, does afterward of it self subsist: That it is
still intelligent and has use of its faculties: That it (because other spirits
are) is capable (...) ^wing things corporeal: That it certain of salvation
passes, (at least those of the more perfect) carried thither by Angels, Luke
16. 22. comp. Matt. 24. 31. Luke 16. 9. comp. Luke 12. 20. into a place of
rest, consolation, inchoative bliss; or certain of its damnation; of
imprisonment, and inchoated pain, till the resurrection of the body. Secondly,
That the souls of the faithful (since his resurrection) are gathered to Christ;
and do, tho not all in the same proximity and degrees of consolations, then see
and behold him, and the blessed Angels. See 2 Cor. 5. 7. comp. with 6. 8. for
if St. Paul desires this change because here we walk by faith, not by sight;
therefore we walk there by sight, not by faith. See 1 Cor. 13. 12. comp. with
10. and Heb. 12. 23. So Calvin, who spoke very warily in this point; Animae
piorum militiae labor defunctae in beatam quietem concedunt, ubi cum felici
laetitia fruitionem promiss^ gloriae expectant: and again: Christus illis
praesens est, and eas recipit in paradisum, ut consolationem percipiant, etc.
Reproborum vero anim^ (the furthest removed from God and light) cruciatus,
quales meritae sunt, patiuntur: and vinctae catenis (ut etiam diaboli Jude 6.)
tenentur, donec ad supplicium, cui addictae sunt, trabantur. It is plain I say
from these texts well considered. Matt. 10. 28. Job 1. 8. 2 Cor. 12. 2, 4. Heb.
12. 23. Act. 7. 59. Luke 23. 43, 46. 1 Pet. 3. 19. Phil. 1. 23. 2 Cor. 5. 1, 2,
3. comp. 6. and 8. Luke 16. 22. (...). 20. Rev. 19. 22. comp. 20. 12. In some
of which, tho some things are said of the person, yet they must needs be
understood only of the soul; ( Animus cujusque est quisque.) And indeed it were
unreasonable to deny to the soul in its state of separation, that converse with
God, those favors, revelations, etc. from him; which we must grant to it in an
ecstasy (wherein the body lies as it were dead and unserviceable unto it;) which
St. Paul experienced in his raptures, 2 Cor. 12. 2. and to the Prophets in
their dreams. These things granted, to see a little further; whether any thing
can be discovered concerning the employments, etc. of the souls of the Blessed,
that are with Christ. First, we find the Court of Heaven (as now it is, since
our Saviors Ascension) described by the Apostle, Heb. 12. 22. etc. to consist
of God, Christ, Angels; a Church or general assembly of the firstborn; and
spirits of just men made perfect; called by him in other places the Family in
Heaven, Ephesians, 3. 15. The Jerusalem above, our Mother-City. Gal. 4. 26. Heb. 12.
22. In respect of which we are said to have our (...) in heaven. Phil. 3. 20.
And perhaps that text, Ephesians. 2. (...). where we are said to be set down with
Christ, may be meant of that part of the Church which now resides in Heaven.
Again, in all St. John's visisions, we (find besides all the usual appearances
of the old Testament) first the representation of a Church or Ecclesiastical
Senate now in heaven (described before, Heb. 12. 22.) and these there praising
God for the Creation Rev. 4. 10, 11. then the Lamb, Rev. 5. 8. for his mercy to
the Church, and for his judgment upon its enemies (for all the works of God are
one of these two:) for the reward they had received, Redemption of the whole
Church out of every nation and people amongst which still this comes in, that
they were made Priests and Kings; as we find it every where frequent, see Rev.
1. 6. -7. 15. -20. 6. and for that they should receive, reigning upon earth, i.
e. in the new Jerusalem descending from Heaven, Rev. 21. 2. after the execution
of Gods judgments upon their, the Churches, enemies. See Rev. 5. 9, 10. -11.
16, 17, 18. which praise in the 4. and 11. chap. the 24. Presbyters singly
perform: and tho (in the 5th) the Cherubims join with them, it is in the
worshipping, not in the song, as drawn in that form; for else the Angels every
where glorify God, as fellow Servants, Rev. 19. 10. -22. 9. for his mercies to
the Church. 2dly. Besides this Senate, we find mention of souls; first of the
primitive Martyrs those slain for the witness of Jesus appearing under the
Altar, (where sacrifices were slain, and the blood, which is the life or soul,
Lev. 17. 14. poured out at foot thereof) and here crying out, How long before
the time of vengeance! Rev. 6. 10. not that they thirst after Revenge, but
their reward; (yet this thirst void of impatience) which it seems was not to be
bestowed till the accomplishment of the rest of their Brethren, (yet under
persecution) and the destruction of their enemies, see Rev. 20. chap. as Gods
reward and punishments have their solemn and set times; and are not of men
single, but of many together; thus it is in the first resurrection, Rev. 20. 4,
5. after destruction of the Beast, etc. Rev. 19. 20. those sooner and later
martyred, crowned at once: and thus in the second Resurrection, Rev. 20. 12. At
the destruction of Satan and death, those long and lately dead raised at once.
Meanwhile there are given them white Robes, and rest: Rev. 6. 11. white robes
implying both the righteousness, innocence, holiness of these Saints, which
they bring with them from the Earth, see Rev. 19. 8. -7. 4. -3. 4. and the
glory, and light, and beauty which is given to this innocence, from God: after
this, upon their number accomplished; and judgment ready to be executed upon
those who killed them. See Rev. 8. 7. etc. we find these souls ( clothed with
white robes and palms in their hands) standing before the Throne, etc. and
praising God and admitted to serve him in his Temple, and to follow the Lamb,
etc. Rev. 7. 9, 15. etc. Next we find the souls of those, who living in latter
times had gotten the victory over the Beast, first with patience resting, and
their good works, i. e. their white linen, following them, Rev. 14. 12, 13.
then their number likewise being accomplished, and now judgment going forth
against the Beast, etc. standing likewise upon the sea of glass before the
Throne with Harps (as the service of the Temple was celebrated with Music. 1 Chronicles. 25. 1.) Harps of God, as 1 Thessalonians. 4. 16. and singing Moses's triumphal
song over the Egyptians: see Rev. 15. 2, 3. -4. 6. To these two may be added
those primitiae of Israel, who first upon earth, upon going forth of judgment,
were sealed to be preserved, Rev. 7. 3. and then are found Rev. 14. 3. praising
God on Mount Sion. Lastly, afte judgment executed and finished as well upon the
Beast, false prophet, etc. Rev. 19. 20. as upon the persecutors of the
primitive Martyrs. Rev. 8. 7. etc. We find the promised reward given to the
souls both of those who were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, Rev. 6. 10. and
those (after) who had not worshipped the Beast, ( Rev. 15. 2. both joined Rev.
20. 4.) in the first resurrection; being then made Priests of God and of
Christ. Rev. 20. 6. When also Christ himself is said in a more special manner
to be admitted to, and possessed of, his Kindom: i. e. after his enemies
destroyed (in respect of his members.) See Rev. 19. 6. -11. 17. -15. 4. Dan. 7.
13, 14, 17. And is yet again to be advanced higher in it; after the day of
judgment; and death destroyed. For that giving up the kingdom to the Father, 1
Cor. 15. 24. and God being all in all, verse. 28. is not an annulling, (except
for the manner of it only) but perfecting of our Saviors kingdom. And all this
is done before the last general resurrection of bodies, set down. Rev. 20. 12.
Now this first Resurrection is either to be restrained to the Martyrs under the
two great persecutions, storied, the first, Rev. 6. chap. the 2d. Rev. 13.
chap. as first fruits; and those, who are come out of great tribulation, Rev.
7. 14. -14. 4. and to some others (perhaps) of extraordinary sanctity; whose
other zealous service for God has equalled the Martyrs sufferings; who shall
have some extraordinary privilege beyond the rest, either in a proper former
resurrection of their bodies upon the destruction of the Beast; (as the general
resurrection follows that of Satan). Which will not seem so great a Paradox
after one has well considered that such a resurrection of bodies not of a few,
but many old Testament Saints has already been accomplished; namely at our
Saviors resurrection, see Matt. 27. 52, 53. who accompanied him ascending as
the first fruits of the Resurrection of the rest by the same Christ to come.
Nor will it be a stranger thing then for some before others to enjoy in their
bodies celestial bliss, then now it is that Enoch and Elias do so. Or in a
Metaphorical one of the soul; ( Martyrs fruuntur (ut loquuntur veteres)
praerogativa resurrectionis: sunt jam nunc (...), sicut alii futuri sunt post
universalem resurrectionem. Grotius Annot. Cassand. Art. 21. which as it is
capable of the expression of a resurrection to grace, Jo. 5. 25. Col. 3. 1.
(according to that of the Schools, Mors animae separatio a Deo. So perhaps, it
may be said to have one, and as it were, a new life, when it is advanced to a
far greater glory (according as Heretics, that held no other resurrection,
applied this term only to it, 2 Timothy 2. 18. 1 Cor. 15. 12.) whilst the souls of
the wicked, that still lie in prison till the great day, are said not to live
again till the day of judgment, and then to be condemned to a second death. See
Matt. 10. 28. and the souls of other faithful only to be at rest. See 1 Cor. 5.
5. Or if the first resurrection be thus understood, namely of souls to greater
glory, then may it be applied not only to the Martyrs, (who are named by St.
John living in times of persecution) (...) only but to the spirits of all the
Saints that are deceased before our Saviors 1000 years reign. Especially if we
consider; first that St. John names such infinite numbers of them of all
nations, etc. Rev. 7. 9. 2. The marriage of the Lamb, which (likely) excludes
no Saints mentioned at this time. Rev. 19. 9. 3. The same reward of reigning,
security, of not being hurt by the second death, etc. Rev. 2. 11, 26, 27.
promised not only to the Martyrs, but all repenting and doing good works: tho I
allow them to the first in a far higher measure. Rev. 2. and 3. chap. 4.
Because he no where makes mention of other Saints, not having the same
privileges; but of other dead. Where, his saying that blessed and holy are
they that have part in the first resurrection, for on such the second death
has no power seems to imply, that the second death should have power over all
the formerly deceased that had not part in it. See Rev. 2. 11. And thus much of
our being admitted first in soul, then also in body by Christ, to the same
honor with him of Priesthood, and vision, and attendance, on God in the holiest
of all. Blessed be such love to sinners for evermore! For what joy do we
imagine would an Israelite have had, to have been introduced within the veil,
and to have beheld the glory between the Cherubims, which yet the High Priest
might then see only through a cloud of incense? How passionately did enamoured
Moses beg for one sight of Gods face, (which only the Gospel admits us to;) and
was suffered only to see his back? and Elias on the Mount of God, after 40
days fast, admitted only to hear his voice? But we all by this High Priest are
advanced in due time even to see face to face. 1 Cor. 13. 12. And this, it is
that holy David inflamed and melted with Divine love every where so much longs
and sighs for, to dwell in Gods house for ever; to behold his beauty in his
Temple: i. e. to live for ever in his presence: for as a Prince makes the
Court, so Gods presence makes a Temple. See Ps. 23. 6. -84. 1. etc. How
amiable. My soul thirsts. Blessed are they that dwell. A day in thy Courts.
Ps. 42. 1. etc. As the Heart pants. And so his chief prayer to God not to turn
away his face; to cause his face to shine; to lift up the light of his
countenance upon him; never to be enjoyed but in his holy place; into which
this our great High Priest first conducted him. The greatness of which Divine
bliss of his, and of all Saints, we may measure (but how infinitely does the
other exceed it,) by the joy we should take in the possession of some earthly
thing with which we are desperately in love; and by the mourning we make for
the loss, i. e. in the absence of it when despaired. So the soul as soon as it
has once cast its eye on the beauty of God, the Original of all that is called
fair, in that Sanctuary, is struck infinitely in love therewith, and enamoured
cries out whom have I in heaven, etc. Ps. 73. 25. the vehement longing after
which, ('it is supposed) drew those expressions from the High Priest himself, in
this his exile from it. How am I straightened, Luke 12. 50. and with desire have I
desired, Luke 22. 15. and from his servant St. Paul; I am in a strait cupiens
dissolvi, etc. Phil. 1. 23. And then this love to the Deity of the Temple, will
naturally produce the service of it; In his Temple does every man speak of his
glory, Ps. 29. 9. eternal singing of praise, and giving of glory unto him; even
like those inflamed Cherubims, that rest not night nor day nor no more do the
Saints, Rev. 7. 15. crying one to another alternately Sanctus, Sanctus,
Sanctus. Rev. 4. 8. Esai. 6. 3. whose imploiment we envy not, only because we
love not. God grant that we may not slothfully, or heavily perform that duty
here, which must be our eternal imploiment hereafter; unless we be eternally
miserable.

To conclude: the last act of our Savior, as High. 19 This High Priests (at the
last day) return out of the Sanctuary, and reappearance to the people.
Priest, is coming again out of the Sanctuary. For as the people waited
without, praying Luke 1. until the Legal High Priest having made a full
atonement came forth again, and blessed them from the Lord. Numb. 6. 23. Lev.
9. 22. So, unto them that look for him, shall Christ, who was once offered to
bear the sins of many, appear a second time here without sin, (i. e. bringing
us full remission hereof) unto our final salvation. Heb. 9. 28. For tho before
it was noted, how he (staying there) blessed us from the Sanctuary; yet it is
not a complete blessing, till his return; when coming forth with his face
shineing, like Moses, from the glory of him before whom he stands, he shall
also glorify us (not only in soul, but in body) like himself: and take and
carry us in with him into the Sanctuary to see his glory and his Fathers glory,
Jo. 17. 24. and to be for ever with them. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 7. Which coming forth,
and glorious appearance of the great God and our Savior therefore all the
Saints (as the Israelites did of old) are said by the Apostle to love, to look
for, and patiently to wait for. 1 Cor. 1. 7. 2 Timothy 4. 8. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 5. Tit.

world was; Jo. 17. 5. And all power and government and judgment committed to
him from the beginning, and in a particular manner the protection and Headship
of the Church. In which office he gave his spirit, as since to the Apostles, so
also of old to the Prophets; and when he came into the world, is said to have
come to his own, and to be born King, etc. Jo. 1. 10, 11. Yet this he did first
out of an infinite desire of his Fathers greater glory; and to (If I may so
say) recover his kingdom, and reduce it into peace; first, by the rebellion of
the Angels, and then the revolt and falling away, and enmity to him of man
also, by the instigations of the Prince of the air, much troubled as it were,
and diminished from what at first it was. (Not that all things forced by his
overuling power, do not still yield subjection unto God ( for who has resisted
his will?) but that he chose rather to found his kingdom over Creatures of
reason in another way; i. e. in a voluntary, free, and chosen submission unto
him; which might be to them an obedience of more reward; and to their Sovereign
of greater honor: (but they straight abused it to his great dishonor and their
own shame;) to repair therefore this kingdom of his Father again, in the way
God first established it, i. e. in man's free submission to, and elected service
of, God.

And out of a zeal to his Fathers greater glory, in. 2. Our Saviors descent

procuring him also to be glorified by us his Creatures, as he also glorified
him. For his chief end of his now-to-be-acquired Kindom was the glorifying of,
his Father not himself; (see Jo. 17. 1. -13. 31, 32. -14. 13. 1 Cor. 15. 28.
comp. 24, 25. where after perfecting of our salvation he resigns his kingdom,
and as man, becomes a subject) for what glory could he purchase a new, which he
had not before voluntarily quitted? see Jo. 17. 5. 2. Next out of the singular
honor he destined for man, to carry up our nature, and set it above all
principalities and powers, etc. and to give us those near relations to God as
no Creature besides is honored with, to be the Lambs wife; to sit down with
him, and judge the nation, nay, Angels, etc. made lower then the Angels to be
crowned in Him with majesty and Honor above them. Ps. 8. Heb. 2. 3. Again out
of compassion to man, (who at the beginning made in Gods image had a kingdom
and immortality promised him, and by his folly lost it) to give him a pattern,
and show him the way how he might regain it. 4. Lastly, to exercise his
kingdom, (which he always had over the Church) now with more tenderness of
love (by contracting new relations unto his subjects, and investing their
nature, and making it a dominion fraternal,) and with (if I may so say) more
pity and compassion from his experirience, by tasting the same infirmities with
them, by which he might also much more strengthen their hope and confidence in
him; and so advance their endeavors. For these and many more reasons foreseen
by this the wisdom of the Father, He emptied Himself of all his eternal
glories; forgot his Creation of all things; laid aside his Crown, his right to
any thing, so rich, and having all things, became poor and having nothing. For
which how lively does he resemble his type Abraham in his leaving his own
Country, and his Fathers house, and coming to sojourn, as it were, into a
strange land. That so he might be made likewise (for the promise to Abraham was
chiefly performed to Christ) Heyr of the world and Lord of all Nations. Till
God should rebestow all these upon him as a reward to a Creature, of yielding
obedience to his Commands, and exercising all sinless patience in all
temptations; according to those promises of a kingdom upon the like patience
and obedience made to man.

For God from the beginning had destined man. 3 A kingdom promis^d to man at
^first.
unto a kingdom; Matt. 25. 34. comp. 41. but according, as his eternal wisdom
had decreed, mutatability and variation in the things here below, and the
building by degrees of perfection out of imperfection; and the bringing forth
of good out of the womb of evil, this kingdom and this glory was to be attained
by man, through free will, through temptations of the threefold enemy, and by a
conquest over them. Therefore the first man also, to come to this happiness,
was first to encounter the world, the flesh, and the devil. A tree set before
him in the very midst of the Garden standing by the tree of life, Genesis 3. 3.
-2. 9. good for food, pleasant for sight, sovereign for its virtue, being
called the tree of knowledge, and desirable (says the text, to make one wise.

And as he, if standing through all these, so his posterity ever since, whosoever
of them shall pass through these temptations in all obedience and patience, are to
have a kingdom, etc. But so it happened; That the first man created to this
hope, yet weakly failed under those assaults; and forsaking Gods word, and
believing the devils lies, sought a kingdom indeed, but not by the way of
humility, and obedience, and shutting his eyes, which God had prescribed; but
by the ambition of wisdom, and having his eyes open, and knowing good and evil,
and being as Gods which the devil suggested; and so both he and his posterity
were defeated of it.

manner of exercising this his Regal power.
For tho all power every where is given him; and when any is executed *it is
executed by him; and no part almost of this his universal power, but has in a
specimen, for an essay and testimony of it, been executed by Him already, even
to that highest one of raising the Dead; by him, and by others also by his
power; yet this power was not received to be, in every part, executed all at
once; but according to the dispensation of the times appointed by the Father,
who gave him this power. See Heb. 2. 8, 9. 1 Cor. 15. 23. etc. Matt. 20. 23. He

are the same enemies also overcome by degrees. They first hindered from
conquering his elect (which power over them he received at the very first);
then hindered from assaulting. For already by the power of his spirit, neither

but only permitted for the exercise of our virtues still to assail us; And that
meanwhile many by these assaults perish, it is not from any defect of the power,
or goodness of this king: who is so dil^gent that of all that his Father gives
him, he calls them all by their names; goes before them, leads them out;

must not transgress) not to take away free will from man, (which done all
further demerit and reward cease, and by which left he must still have a
possibility to sin) till the consummation of the world. But this only Free Will

is there that he could have done for his vineyard that he has not done? for
there is nothing in or without us, that can oppose him concerning ns, if we our
selves do not See Romans 11. 23. [When we believe not, when we will not Matt. 23.

to overthrow the nature of man, has set to the power of his Son; they arguing
no impotency, nor unwillingness in him, but incapability in us. Else all things
that can make man happy shall be accomplished by the omnipotent power of this
King of Saints in their proper season.

the Kingdom of Christ, that was but then vagient in its infancy, should
presently appear in its full strength without any intermediate growth: which
had it then come to pass, and so nothing have been capable of any further
perfection, the world must also presently have concluded: the fullness of all
perfection being only in the last scene of the last Act thereof. For there is
no decrease or revolution to imperfection, or standing at a stay in the work of
God (Man, his image cannot endure this in his petty contrivances,) but
increasing always and advancing to that just height he has determined for
them. A prognostication of which governing the world he has left us in the 6
days work of the Creation of it. And so our Saviors kingdom is not yet come to
its period of perfection. See Dan. 7. 14, 9. Heb. 2. 8. Rev. 11. 15. -16. 17.

ago he then led captivity, (i. e. Sin, Satan, and his instruments, Death and

(as we say, there needs no government where nothing can disobey) and return
with the Father, and and the Holy Spirit, to govern after a new, and, in
respect of the manner of it (if I may so say,) after an higher way; i. e. God
shall govern immediately without any appropriated service of Christ, or Angels,
or men, his substitutes; or use of external means, without the least
contradiction or opposition of any thing in his kingdom, whereby his glory now
is, as it were, violated and diminished; himself offended and displeased. When
God takes again to him, as it were, his great power, see the expression Rev.
11. 17. (for God the Father, by the wickedness of free will, now as it were,
admits and undergoes some diminution of his glory) and governs with as entire
and pure a glory as we may imagine he did before the world was, and when there
was nothing but himself; and perfect and infinite glory reflected only from
himself. Our Savior also having this kingdom resigned, (as he then had it) with
him. Jo. 17. 5. So now, as then, above all, and through all, and in all, Ephesians. 4.

Saviors government (such as now it is,) is only the transition of it into a
greater perfection, for it endures for ever and ever. Luke 1. 33. The more
things multiplicious are united, and things diverse (...) into God; the more
they also being perfected. Which as it is true in all other creatures, so also
(according to his humanity) may be verified of our Savior, blessed for ever
more! In respect of which consummation of all things, that is yet to come, all
the present things, which are consummations of the types of former times, are
but types themselves, and imperfections; as also many of those prophecies that
are already fulfilled in there are to have a second fuller accomplishment
hereafter. Our Saviors first coming but a type of the second; and the
prophecies applied to this, see Mal. 3. 1. Matt. 3. 10, 12. much more verified
and fulfilled in that. Our Sabbaths but types of the rest to come; the present
communion of Christ's body and blood, and the present inhabitation of his
spirit, but types and earnest-pence of a more intimate incorporation and union
to him hereafter. When whatever he is we shall be like him, tho we cannot now
imagine what we shall be: and our present knowledge and conceit of things,
seeing them under the law, through a veil; under the Gospel, through a glass,

such as shall hereafter vanish away, 1 Cor. 13. 8, 12. but by improvement, as
Stars vanish in a greater light. Meanwhile all things under this King of Saints
go on apace to their perfection; by whom all that is imperfect shall at last be
done away. And in his Majesty may he ride on prosperously; and may his arrows
be sharp in the heart of his enemies; and the people be subdued unto him; and
may he remember his poor servants now he is in his kingdom; to whom be glory
for ever. Amen.

Lastly, to conclude this chapter as the rest, what. 12.
is said of his Kingdom, is verifyed also of the Saints; By whose merits, after
whose example, under whose conduct, assisted by his spirit, protected by his
power, all those who depend on him shall also overcome, shall have a kingdom,
thrones, reign on Earth, rule over the nations, judge men and Angels, etc. only
saving to him the primogeniture, the preeminence, the right hand, etc. Rev. 2.

of men ever since the Creation; And as well these before, as those since, his
coming in the flesh attained salvation and were blessed only by, in, and through,
him. God, (perfecting, as all his other works, so that of our redemption by
degrees; and still reserving some better thing behind, to superinduce upon the
former; that the precedent, without the following, times might not be made
perfect; Heb. 11. 40.) appointed not the full-manifestation of his Son, for
taking away our sin, etc. nor, (after the Son reascended,) the visible and more
plenary descension of the Holy Ghost, for enabling our obedience, etc. till the
last times indeed: But yet he not only promised them, (I mean to his Church,)
from the beginning, [where note; that in what manner the sending of the Messiah
or the promised seed so the sending of the spirit, wat only promised to former
ages. See for this (which is less taken notice of) Gal. 3. 14. Act. 2. 3^, 39.

only in types, (the figures and representations of what was to come:) [As all
former times were, almost in all things, types of the latter, see 1 Cor. 10. 6,

his mercies, judgments, etc.) what they are, and what they will be, by what
they always have been; and so, in both kinds, might hope, and fear, the same
things to fall out to them; which have come from God formerly upon others, for
their example] but in the virtue and benefit of them. Through the grace of our

so all judgments upon the wicked and the enemies thereof were executed by the

sunt indivisa; and all external works are of the whole Trinity, yet in the
operation, the same manner of concurrence cannot be attributed to the 3
persons: we cannot say that as the Father made the world by the Son; so that
the Son, by the Father. Nor that as the Son became incarnate; so the Father:
Nor because our Saviors prayers were addressed to the Father, therefore they
were to the Holy Ghost, or to the Son i. e. himself. Now then to prove this,
that we pretend, more fully; and here to pass by that deduction (firm enough)
of God the Fathers creating, upholding, governing all things by his eternal
Son, therefore governing the Church (his people Elect, whose God he more
specially calls himself) these, I say, more especially by the same person his
Son.

David calls his Lord, is expressly by our Savior expounded to be himself,
Matt. 22. 44. and Himself, not as he was David's Son, since by his question he
employed that Christ as David's Son could not be his Lord; but as Gods Son; which
the blind Jews imagined not. So of God and God Psalm. 45. 6. comp. 7. see Heb.

2. Numb. 21. 5. Heb. 11. 26, 1 Pet. 3. 19. -1. 11. Matt. 23. 37. where How often
would I, etc. seems to be meant also before his incarnation, by the Prophets,
whom he always sent; before, and since. Neither does that saying, 1 Jo. 4. 12.
Jo. 1. 18. [ No man has seen God at any time] 1 Timothy 6. 16. [ nor can see him]
(grounded on Gods words in ^xod. 33. 20, 22.) thwart that, which has been
said; or oppose the visions and apparitions of God veiled in created
representations and images; but only those visions of him in his own nature and
essence: or that more proper glory, wherein he shall be seen by us in the next
world, 1 Cor. 13. 12. which devouring fire and unaccessible light nothing
mortal can behold without being melted and consumed; the image of which also is
sometimes represented so glorious, as neither is it beholdable, see Lev. 16.
13. and mostwhat so glorious, as not seen without great horror and trembling;
the ordinary symptoms in all apparitions; even those not only of God, but of
Angels. And this invisible glory is called Gods face, Exodus 33. 20. Not but
that Gods face also has been seen, see Genesis 32. 30. Judge. 6. 22. etc. But that
face was only a vizard (if I may so say) over his own face; and that glory but
a shadow of his own glory (therefore Moses after a sight of these, Exodus 24.
10, 16. Numb. 12. 8. still affectionately desired a sight of the other. Exodus
33. 18.) Sometimes made more, sometimes less, glorious; as when in the form of
a man he dined with Abraham. But yet except when the divine Majesty personated
an ordinary man, seldom in any glorious apparition under the times of the law
was his figure, or at least his face, seen; this familiarity being reserved, in
the incarnation of God, for the times of the Gospel. 1 Jo. 1. 1. Jo. 1. 14. The
appearance to Abraham (in a vision or reality it matters not for our purpose)
Genesis 15. 17. comp. 12. was a blazing flame issuing out of a Furnace environed
with darkness. Exodus 24. 16. The sight of the glory of the Lord was like a
devouring fire to the people, and to the Elders who had more clear vision,
verse. 10. there is mention only of (as it were) a Saphire-pavement under his
feet: and remember (says Moses) Deuteronomy. 4. 15. that ye saw no manner of
similitude. Moses his importunity afterward only saw his shoulders passant, and
was entertained chiefly, as also Elijah, and as Adam in Paradise, Genesis 3. 8,
10. like some terrible noise in the air indicating Gods presence with a voice
and a proclamation. This being the time of hearing his word, hereafter of
vision; see Exodus 33. 19. -34. 6. 1 King. 19. 12. Ezekiel. 1. 26, 27. the
appearance of the loins of a man, and flames covering the upper and the lower
parts. Esai. 6. 1. No description of his person, save the posture only sitting
on a Throne; only a particularizing of the Cherubims. Dan. 7. 9. A description
of his covering, his vestment, and his hair, but not of his person. Rev. 4. 3.
no description of any figure, only the luster like a Jasper or Sardin-stone;
only Rev. 1. 12. In St. John's vision of our glorified Savior, there we find all
the parts of his body punctually described, much resembling Daniels of that
glorious Angel, c. 10. 5. which some also imagine to have been our Savior.

3. This appears in that some of the apparitions. 6. Some old Testament

of God in the old Testament must be granted to be of the second person; as
that vision Esai. 6. 1. which is interpreted expressly of Christ Jo. 12. 41.
comp. 40. quoted out of Esai. 6. where this vision is related and this being
the Lord, whose glory resided in the Temple, and sat between the Cherubims.
That vision Ezekiel. 1. 26. must needs be of the same Lord too; see Psalm. 68. 24.
comp. 18. now the same Lord residing in the Temple, and before, in, or upon the
Tabernacle; it follows that the Lord conducting the Church in the wilderness,
was also the second person. And from these, which must be granted, From these

many other appearances in reason cannot be denied to have been of the same
person. Especially most of them being acts of care, and providence, and mercies
toward the Church. Amongst which (to name only some of them) that to Abraham As
those to Abraham.
seems to be, Genesis 18. where it is plain, that one of the 3 celestial persons
was the Lord; Abraham speaking in the singular, and but calling one of them
Lord, verse. 13, 17. And two of them only entering Sodom; whilst the third, which
was the Lord, stayed and discovered the destruction of the City, verse. 22, 33.
whom see again, Genesis 19. 16, 17. talking with Lot, and verse. 24. executing
judgment on the wicked, after he had saved the Righteous: coming then with
salvation and promises in one hand for the good; promises of himself to come:
and through him of the inheritance of heaven, typified in Canaan; and deliverance
from Hell, typified in Lot; and with judgments in the other hand upon the
impious; judgment of fire and brimstone, and being cast into a bottomless lake
in hell, typified in Sodom. And since our Savior says when the Jews asked him
Jo. 8. whether he had seen Abraham, that he was before Abraham, and that
Abraham had seen his day and was glad: (where it seems plain by verse. 38, 23.
that he was discoursing of himself, as being the eternal Son of God; which the
Jews so much stumbled at, and St. John's relations every where so much
vindicate. And that the day, he speaks of, is that permanent one of eternity,
which never ends; and to which all time is but as one day, 2 Pet. 3. 8. why may
he not expressly mean it of these visions of Abraham? and the glad tidings he
brought him in them of that coming, which the Jews then, yet without rejoicing
as Abraham, beheld? And might not Abraham be said thus to see his glory; as
well as To Noah.
Esai (it must be granted) did? 2. And next the descent of the Lord in the
times of Noah; how like is it to this in Abraham's time before the firing of
Sodom? And his conference with and complaint to Noah, see Genesis 6. 3, 7, 8, 12,
13. -7. 1, 16. and his promises to him and Covenant with him, and his seed;
Genesis 6. 18. -9. 9. etc. to those with Abraham. And his preserving of Noah with
his family, and his shutting them up in the Ark, Genesis 7. 16. to his delivering
of Lot and his leading him forth by the hand; And his causing it to rain those
miraculous waters by opening the windows of heaven, and springs of the deep,
Genesis 7. 4, 11. to the fiery rain upon Sodom? and how well do these agree with
that expression. 1 Pet. 3. 19? So that it seems without doubt these two of the
firing of Sodom; and of the flood; and that of drowning the Egyptians in the
Red sea, with the salvation of Noah, Lot, and Israel being the 3 grand types to
the world of the last great judgment to come, see 2 Pet. 2. 5, 6. Jude 5. 7.
that they were executed by the same hand, see 2 Pet. 2. 5, 6. Luke 17. 26, 28.
that the other shall be even the Son of God; to whom the Father for ever has
committed all mercy and judgment. 3. The same person it seems to be, that first
wrestled with, (as To Jacob, etc.
he does in afflictions with all the pious) and then blessed, Jacob: Genesis 32.
24. That appeared to, and was adored by, Joshuah. Josh. 5. 13. 14, 15. comp.
Exodus 3. 5. To Gideon, Judge. 6. 22. To Manoah. Judge. 13. 15. etc. all which may
be gathered from the arguments forementioned. And I can call to mind in the
sacred story only, 2 apparitions or visions which certainly appear to be of God
the Father: That of the Ancient of days, Dan. 7. 9. comp. 13. and Rev. 4. 2.
comp. c. 5. 5. 4. Lastly, he was That to Moses on Mount Sinai, on the (...), In
the Wilderness, In the Temple, etc.
the Angel that conducted the Church in the wilderness, as is showed above; and
by consequence that gave them the law in Mount Sinai: for tho the law is said
to be given by the disposition and promulgation of Angels, Act. 7. 53. Gal. 3.
19. Heb. 2. 2. multitudes of whom appeared in the Mount, Deuteronomy. 33. 2. Psalm. 68.
17. by whom those voices were formed in the Air. Heb. 2. 2. In which speaking
of the law to the people the Angels were Mediators, as afterward in receiving
from the Angel and carrying the law to them, Moses was, Gal. 3. 19. [which is
taken notice of several times in the new Testament, to show the preeminence of
the Gospel: since the law was (...), and (...), Him; (...), (...), (...), the

delivered to men by the intermediation of Angels and Moses, Servants and
Ministers; but the Gospel by the mediation of his only Son, made flesh that he
might familiarly converse with man, without those terrors that accompanied the
law:] yet the supreme Legislator was God: Deuteronomy. 33. 2. Exodus 20. 1. Exterior
loquela Angelorum, interior Dei per Angelum; and that the Son, the eternal
word, and Vicegerent of the Father; called the Angel Act. 7. 38. that spoke
with Moses upon the Mount, from whom he received the law written with his
finger: the same Angel that appeared in the bush, verse. 35. that conducted them
in the cloud. Which sovereign Legislator, for the glorifying of his Father and
the saving of man, humbled himself afterward to become Himself the Mediator.
The type of which mediation of his, Moses then was; both in delivering the will
of God to the people, coming down to them from the Holy place in the Mount; and
also ascending and interceding forty days to God for the people. Deuteronomy. 9. 18,
25, 26. As he since has both descended in flesh from the bosom of the Father,
to declare and reveal all his will to us, Jo. 1. 18. who only saw his face, but
Moses only his backparts: and in whose face the glory of the Gospel shone, as
of the law in Moses his face, see 2 Cor. 4. 6. comp. 3. 7. and is ascended
again to the Father to intercede for us; this Real Moses remembering him, not of
our righteousness, etc. but of the promise he made to them of the blessed sced,
D^ut. 9. 27. and of the triumph the spiritual and temporal enemies of God would
make over the deserted, tho most worthy to be deserted, Church verse. 28. By
whose prayers and intercessions it now stands, and shall stand for ever. Amen.

of God also under the old Testament was by the Son of God. Next for the Holy
Ghost: The operations also of Holiness in men under the old Testament was by
the same spirit. By it, then, Regeneration, Gal. 4. 29. and our Savior wondered
at a Doctor in Israel, Jo. 3. 10. that he was ignorant of it. Tho therefore
Christ not yet ascended, and this Holy Spirit not then received and poured out
in so full a measure upon all flesh; yet as of the Son the Author; so of the
Holy Spirit the promise; of the Gospel; there were made some predescents in the
old Testament, Esai. 63. 10, 11. Nehem. 9. 30. Zech. 4. 6. some sprinklings and

gift of tongues we find reserved as a property to the Gospel upon the enlarging
of the Church from one before, at this time to all nations, and languages. We
find this Holy Spirit also represented of old (both in the Tabernacle and the
Temple,) in those 7 lamps of the 7 branched candlestick; as also in the first
descent upon the Apostles it appeared in a flame or tongue of fire: Act. 2. 1.
see Exodus 25. 40. comp. Rev. 4. 5. and 5. 6. and Zech. 4. 10, 2. comp. 6. We
find it then poured upon Moses, in type of Christ; and from him portions of it
derived upon the 70 Elders, Numb. 11. 18. etc. whose sudden prophesying upon it
became then also, as in the Acts, a wonder to the people, verse. 27. 28. as it
was from Christ upon the Apostles; and so many thousands ever since, and shall

Therefore one attribute, Esai. 11. 2. is spirit of might; and in the new
Testament, Comforter: Upon Saul, and David; presently upon their anointing; by
which they were changed and became new men. 1 Samuel 10. 6. -16. 13. see its
inspiration of the holy writers; Moses; David; the Prophets: Matt. 22. 43. Heb.
8. 9. -3. 7. Mark. 12. 36. Act. 7. 51. Luke 2. 26. And specially on the sons of
the Prophets.
Act. 1. 16. 1 Cor. 2. 13. Its wonderful operations upon the sons of the
Prophets; whereby they were put at certain times into wonderful ecstasies and
raptures, (like those under the Gospel. Act. 10. 10. -22. 17. -9. 9. comp. 12.
2 Cor. 12. 2, 7.) into strange and unusual actions and agitations of their
bodies. 2 Samuel 6. 14. Psalm. 26. 6. 2 King. 4. 35. -2. 16. -9. 11. 1 King. 18.
12. Ezra 3. 12, 14. (see the like. Matt. 4. 1. Act. 8. 39. -20. 22. -16. 7.
-18. 5.) So violent that Saul, (in their society possessed with the same) is
said to have stripped himself of his clothes, i. e. his upper garment, and to
have lain down all night unclothed, being wearied withose strange motions, etc.
perhaps Psalm. 149. 3. meant of this. They in these raptures not foretelling
things to come, 2 King. 2. 3, 5. but conceiving, and on a sudden, after an
unusual manner, dictating, psalms, songs, the praises of God, or explanation of
some mystery, or former prophecy. See 1 Samuel 18. 10. 1 King. 18. 29. 1 Chronicles.
25. 3. comp. 1 Cor. 11. 5. And the spirit then as now did more ordinarily
inspire persons, first by their profession consecrated to God, Jo: 11. 51.
prepared by studies and exercises of devotion in Schools for this purpose;
amongst which means was composing the spirits by music. 1 Samuel 10. 5. -16. 16.
Ps. 43. 4. 2 King. 3. 15. Some of the singers Prophets, Asaph, etc. There being
many Colleges of them in several places; Naioth, Bethel, Hiericho, inhabited
by great numb^rs. See 2 King. 2. 3, 5, 7. -4. 38. so the Levites, that were the
singers, were also spiritual composers of holy psalms, 1 Chronicles. 25. 2, 5. 2 Chronicles. 29. 30. And many of the Prophets were Priests or Levites, Samuel,
Ezekiel, Jeremy. And now also that the miraculous graces of the spirit are
someway both procured and improved by industry, study, prayer, faith, expecting
and desiring to receive them seems to appear from. 1 Cor. 12. 31. -14. 1. Romans
12. 6. 1 Timothy 4. 13, 14. 2 Timothy 1. 6. 1 Pet. 11. 10, 11, 12. And this may serve
to show that the Ancient world were not unacquainted with the operations of the
spirit; and in some measure pretasted this promise of the latter days; which
wrought in all times after the same manner; and came then also from the same
Author, the Lord Christ: see 1 Pet. 1. 11. -3. 19. 2 Pet. 1. 21. 1 Cor. 12. 5.
Only now its illuminations are greater under the Gospel, Matt. 11. 11. Jo. 16.
13. and further extended; even to all flesh; amongst whom it continues all its
rich gifts; For we must not make the times of Christ inferior to those of the
law; nor the times of the making of the promises, to be perfecter then those of
their accomplishment. Thus much of the energyes, and actings of the Holy Ghost
in men under the old Testament as well as under the new. And accordingly, there
has been always the same Covenant of Grace: the same faith in, and by, the
Son and Holy Spirit, Gal. 3. 8, 17. etc. and the same Sacraments 1 Cor. 10. 2,
3. from the beginning.

To show which things somewhat more punctually * 8. The 2 Covenants from the

and particularly. First Gods prescience, seeing man's use of his Free Will and
his fall, foreordained our Savior before the foundation of the world, tho he
manifested him not till the last times. 1 Pet. 1. 20. And presently after the
fall, (out of overflowing mercy) in the very curse, he delivered also the cure
of it; and condemned the seducer of man to be destroyed by the (then first
promised) seed of the woman, i. e. Christ, who also (immediately) was the seed
of the woman only, whom Satan first seduced; that he might be destroyed also by
the same instrument i. e. woman, by which he thought to destroy man. Upon the
multiplying of this seed, we find accordingly, because the promise of God did
not take effect in all the seed, see Romans 9. 6. etc. Gal. 4. 26. etc. we find
in that infancy of the world, the same distinction of men, as now, noted indeed
by the Apostle more expressly of Abraham's double seed, Gal. 4. 22. but as true
of Adams, and of all the Two generations always: One of works, the other of
faith.
times since the beginning: as likewise those other remarks that are made upon
them, Gal. 4. 29. Romans 9. 12. (that the elder should first persecute, at last
serve, the younger) we find then one generation after the flesh, another after
the spirit; one of old Adam involved in no covenant but that of works, and by
those (being evil) loosing the heavenly inheritance; the other of the promise,
and attaining it by faith. And these we find called the sons of God, (which
none are but by Christ.) Genesis 5. 2. The other sons of men or in opposition to
the former sons of the wicked one the devil. 1 Jo. 3. 10, 12. In which respect
the wicked Jews seem to be reckoned as the spiritual race or succession of
Cain; since Abels blood is required of them, Matt. 23. 35, 36. Jo. 8. 44. (God
and the Devil being the two spiritual fathers of the progeny of man. Jo. 8. 42.
etc.) The one pilgrims on the earth, Heb. 11. 13. The other men of this world;
noted for their building of Cities as Cain, Genesis 4. 17. and Nimrod; Genesis 10. 8,
9, 10. not so the others. The city and type of the one, Babylon, called
confusion; and of the other, Jerusalem, intimating peace and unity. The one
having a confusion of languages amongst them; The other retaining (as proper to
them) the first language of paradise; called afterward the Hebrew, from Heber,
(in whose time the earth was divided); and afterward, amongst his multiplied
posterity, adhering only to Abraham's race. And of the former of these there was
a Church of God erected from the beginning; which had Gods more special
presence in the same land where paradise was. Genesis 4. 16. Which Church seems
(from Matt. 19. 4, 8. comp. Genesis 6. 1, 2. and 4. 19. and Mal. 2. 15.) to have
been then restrained both from polygamy, and marrying with the unbelievers;
which matching with them afterward was cursed with a gigantick, (and
consequently tyrannous) offspring, like that of Cain's, the wicked generation,
Genesis 6. 4. -4. 23, 24. and of which matching after the flood Abraham and the
Patriachs had much abhorrence: doubtless because the worship and fear of the
true God was not among them. See Genesis 20. 11. -24. 3. -27. 24. From which
wicked Cain was excommunicated and banished, whose murdering of his brother
may be guessed [by the way of Cain] being joined with [ the gainsaying of Core]
Jude 11. to have been, not only out of envy to him; because his sacrifice was
more accepted, but out of emulation; for his being some way or other more
specially preferred in the ministration also of the divine worship: and his
race proved like him, full of violence, murders, many wives, etc. Genesis 4. 23,
24. -6. 11. see Genesis 4. 3, 12, 14, 16.

Amongst these sons of God Abel was the first, recorded. 9. (...). (...).
in the Heb. c. 11. declared there to be righteous; or justified and accepted
of God by faith: and that faith was; that God was a rewarder of all those that
diligently seek him, verse. 6. which is a faith in Gods promises: and a faith of
things not seen, verse. 1. a faith therefore of promises not yet attained; and
indeed why else his blood cry after death? verse. 4. how else did he and the
rest die in faith? verse. 13. if not something hoped for after death? viz. the
restoring of that paradise which was lost; see verse. 16, 26, 39. and the
restoring of life again to the innocent; as well as future vengeance on the
oppressor. Righteous Abel slain by him that was Seth: the first Father of the

born after the flesh; that God might show in the first Saint the lot of his

restoring of man in Christ, to the image in which God created Adam. Col. 3. 10.

manner pious; who served God out of faith that he was a rewarder of the
diligent seekers of him; and accordingly received that reward in an anticipated
translation: that the times before the law might in him have a type of the
advancement of the promised seed, and an example of the promised reward to all
believers through him; as those under the law had in Elias; and those under the
Gospel saw in the seed it self. See Heb. 11. 5, 6. The eighth preacher of
righteousness was Noah; And (...)
here (in the tenth generation from Adam) the world that then was, was to be
(as this second also shall be) for its wickedness destroyed, but, after first
the preaching to them by Christ, 1 Pet. 3. 19. i. e. by the spirit of Christ, 1
Pet. 1. 11. the same Gospel which is preached to us, viz. that as Christ was
(in the appointed time) put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit;
so they might be judged and be put to death or become dead in the flesh,
according to the former will and lusts of men; and be quickened in the spirit
according to the will of God. See 1 Pet. 4. 6. comp. verse. 1, 2. and 1 Pet. 3.
18, 19. 2 Pet. 8. 9.

At which time (the world after this preaching of. 9. Of the covenant of Grace
made, or rather renewed, with him.
the Gospel unto them and the long-suffering of God 1 Pet. 3. 20. for an 120
years, Genesis 6. 3. still continuing disobedient), and being to be destroyed by
water (the type of the end of it to come by fire) we find the first express
mention of a Covenant; established with Noah and his seed, Genesis 6. 18. (where
[my] not [a] seems to me to imply the continuation, not the beginning of a
Covenant) in which God makes a promise to save him in this ark of the Covenant,
and to bless the earth unto him; which was cursed for sin; and then should have
been destroyed. Genesis 6. 13. Which also his Father at his birth prophesied of
him, Genesis 5. 29. and to regive to him and his seed the dominion of the world;
which after the flood he gives him the possession of: see Genesis 9. 1. etc. And
this promise we find made to Noah almost in the same terms, (that we n^d not
doubt of the same thing intended by it) as it was afterward to Abraham ( that
he also should be the heir of the world, Romans 14. 13. etc.) so also, of Noah as
of Abraham, it is said, that he became heir of the righteousness which is by
faith, Heb. 11. 7. that is heir of the benefits thereof, promised unto him. And
the promise was one and the same from the beginning, first of the coming into
the world of the promised seed, which is already fulfilled: and then of the
restoring of man, (first in, and then by the promised seed) to the inheritance
which he forfeited by Adams fall; which inheritance was, 1. a right both to the
earth and the creatures therein, (which since Adams fall none have right to
before God, but only through Christ.) 2. And more specially to the heavenly
country and city, Heb. 11. 16. called also entering into Gods rest, Heb. 4. 6.
etc. that yet to come, verse. 7, 8, 9. In the presignification of which rest to
come the Sabbath was appointed from the beginning to be observed with rest,
etc. see Heb. 4. 3, 9, 10. after the 6 days labor of this world, and after
our deliverance from the persecutions of Egypt, that is, all (whatever) the
Churches enemies. For because both these are the same in the substance,
therefore was it instituted as a symbol of both, see Exodus 31. 17. (Gods work
in the creation, after which he is said to be refreshed, being a type of his
work in the redemption of the world, and in the Elect) from which also being
perfected he shall rest at the day of judgment: which city these holy men also
looked after. Heb. 11. 10, 13, 39. comp. with Heb. 8. 2. -9. 11. And we also
yet expect till the second coming of our Savior. Of which promise that of the
earth was a type to Noah; as that of Canaan to Abraham. Which promise is
already made good to the seed; and shall be by him to Noah; and to Abraham; and
to all those who are of the Covenant, and of faith; who shall be blessed with
faithful Abraham, Gal. 3. 9. through the seed of Abraham; to whom the promise is
(in the first place) made, Gal. 3. 16. being heir of all things, Heb. 1. 2. and
in whom the Covenant is conformed to Abraham and the rest, Gal. 3. 17. to be
fulfilled in its due time; As they were looking at the promise of the seed to
come afar off, and not made perfect in that without us, who have already seen
it fulfilled; so we also yet looking afar off at the promise of our inheritance
(by the seed) yet to come; and neither they nor we made perfect in this till
the end come. When the wicked shall be finally destroyed, and the righteous
delivered and saved: of which eternal salvation the preserving of Noah and his
family in the general deluge was an eminent type, see 2 Pet. 2. 5. comp. with
9. as also the saving of Lot and his family in the second fiery judgment of
Sodom; and the saving of the Israelites, (i. e. the Church of God, Act. 7. 38.)
in the t^ird great day of judgment, in the slaying the firstborn, and drowning
of the Egyptians. Of which Israelites afterward not believing, only two, (in
the consuming of all the rest in the wilderness) entered Canaan. Where the
saving also so few in comparison of the world that perished (because men loved
evil more then righteousness) is a type of the paucity of the saved at the last
day. See Romans 9. 27. And the manner of Noah's being saved was also a type; His
being saved by or upon the water was a figure of Baptism, by which we are (...)
type of Ba^.
now saved, 1 Pet. 3. 21. as also was the passing of the Israelites to their
preservation through the Red sea. 1 Cor. 10. 2. And if we may say the same of the
Rainbow the seal of the Covenant with Noah, as of the cloud that conducted the
Israelites; this also was the figure of Baptism, 1 Cor. 10. 2. which is the
seal now current of the Covenant of grace. And if they had then the seals, they
had also the Covenant to which they belonged. Now for the other Sacrament of
the Eucharist; the Eucharistical sacrifices Of the Eucharist.
(which were from the beginning) of the flesh of which the offerers did
partake, were ever the types thereof. Nor may I pass over, (in showing the
Gospel of Noah) the Covenant then that was made not only with Noah but also the
Creatures, Genesis 9. 10, 12. which, as they (the earth, etc.) were cursed for
sinning Adams sake, Genesis 3. 17. -4. 12. Romans 8. 20. and with man were to be
destroyed, Genesis 6. 7, 12, 13. so in the Covenant of grace, by the promised seed
they also shall be freed from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
liberty of the Sons of God, Romans 8. 20, 21. etc. of which, their deliverance
with Noah was a preludium, Genesis 5. 29.

After Noah Shem for his filial Duty, Genesis 9. 24.. 11. Shem,
was the heir of the Covenant of grace, and Father of the holy seed; imagined
by some to be Melchisedeck, but the Father of Heber and the Hebrew's he was,
Genesis 10. 21. and as God vouch^afed afterward to be called the God of Abraham,
so before him he was called the God of Shem; Genesis 9. 26. And then also Noah
prophesied of the posterity of Japhet, The Lord called the God of Shem.
the Gentiles, their being united also to the Church descended from Shem; which
prediction was fulfilled upon the coming of the promised seed. Genesis 9. 26, 27.
And it is noted, as of Noah, that he lived to see the 9th generation, even till
the 58th year of Abraham; so of Shem, and Salah, and Heber, that they all
outlived Abraham: which long life of these holy men was surely a great
advantage for catechizing their children in the true service of God. Yet many
of Shem's race in time fell away to idolatry. See Josh. 24. 2, 14, 15. Genesis 3.
53.

And therefore God 17 years after Noah's death and. 11. Abraham.
367 years after the flood called Abraham out of the house and country of his
idolatrous Fathers, and opens the same way of salvation, (i. e. the Gospel) Of
the Covenant of Grace renewed with, and the Gospel preached to, him.
more clearly yet to him (therefore he called the Father of the faithful) God
promising him, that he should be heir of the world, ( Romans 4. 13. (that is) in
his seed: and that seed, Christ Gal. 3. 16, 17. Christ, the promise that was
made both to him and to all the Fathers. See Act. 13. 32, 33. 2 Cor. 1. 20.

of it, binding them to the observance also of all the rest) was circumcision
then a seal. See Romans 4. 11, 13. Act. 2. 38, 39. and the Antitype of our
baptism. God beginning now more ceremoniously and solemnly to own his Church;
setting a corporeal mark upon it, whereby his people might be more signally
separated and distinguished from the rest of men; as afterward (they
multiplying into a nation,) in Moses's time, he distinguished them by peculiar
laws. Fourteen generations after Abraham was the Gospel yet more evidently
preached to David (that his seed, his David.
son should rule over all the whole world, etc.) which seed promised to David
also was Christ, see Act. 13. 23. and this covenant again established with him.
The same Covenan^ renewed to him.
See Ps. 89. 3. ^ Chron. 17. 11. Act. 13. 23, 24. and Ps. 72. and 89. The
subject of whose songs is almost nothing else but Christ; as we see from the
expositions of them in the new Testament. And because the promises were made
more fully to Abraham and to David; therefore has our Savior more chiefly the
title, of [ the seed of Abraham, and of the Son of David] then of others. See
Matt. 1. 1. And David was followed by the goodly fellowship of the Prophets,

and perfection.

And let this be observed to the glory of the. 12
mercies of God everlasting, certain, never-failing, (neither by Satan's
polices, nor by men's sin); how at a certain distance of time, God always mindful
of his covenant with his elect. (For though God is no accepter of persons, Act.

of properties and parts (for the reason why any have these better then others
is purely because he gave them); yet he is an admitter or receiver of one man's
person, not another; of one nation, not another; they being in all things
equal (or mostwhat he whom he receives some way inferior); to gratuital favors
for his own to us unknown pleasure, no way grounded upon any thing in the
person. He preaccepteth none in point of justice, so as to do wrong to any; or
deny to any their merit and due, tho due only upon his promise, by which he
has tied himself to reward industry, and our right use of his former gifts;
Matt. 25. 29. see Matt. 20. 13, 14, 15. But in point of liberality he does, so
as to do more good to some then others, without any cause at all that is in the
person: Romans 9. 11. -3. 3. -11. 29. Esai. 41. 2, 4. Nor is this said, as if he
did not ordinarily give more with respect to some former gifts of his (either
those of nature, or those of grace; those acquisit by man's industry, or infused
by Gods mercy) that are in such or such a person, see Matt. 25. 15, 29. but
that he has not tied himself to give only where are former gifts; and many
times does otherwise out of respect of the superabundance and overflowings of
his mercies, and of his Church upon earth: which his everlasting purpose had
determined (notwithstanding men's frequent Apostacies) to maintain from the
beginning to the end of the world, Romans 3. 3, 4. -11. 29, 36. even then when he
had most reason of all to desert it; after it had begun to decline to idolatry,
Atheism, etc. sent new preachers of this Covenant, and renewed the true
Religion by them. And how not in the best of times, for a reward of obedience;
but in the worst ever out of a necessity of repair; not in the growth but the
decadency of former piety; his eternal pity still visited the world with new
light and new Ambassadors. Some 600 years after the Creation, As by Enoch

16. 59. etc. Not as if he did not require our repentance for to obtain the
return of his favors, especially to challenge or expect it; which is so
effectual to hasten his mercies, and cut off the remains of justice. See Lev.
25. 39. Ezekiel. 6. 8, 9. But if this be not: Man's impenitence or unbelief shall
not frustrate for ever Gods faith, promise, glory; Romans 3. 3. But he will
create new hearts in us rather; and we shall repent after his mercies at least,
when not before: and St. Paul shall cry out; O the depth! Who has first given
unto him, Romans 1l. 35. For he who has tied himself upon repentance to show
mercy; has not tied himself not to show it but only upon repentance. And
indeed Gods judgments many times, (particularly war) making men worse; and his
punishments (by our desperate malignity) increasing sin; whence could any
reformation begin but from himself? who is forced at last, (when our sin
contends in duration with his justice) because his mercies endure for ever, to
pardon us for nothing. Nay when his favors are built upon our repentance, it is
the same, tho not so short a way of pure mercy. We have no goodness but that
some grace prevents it. It only makes its own way; it is only it, that invites
itself; and prepares its own lodging; and if we would find out the beginning of
Gods mercies we can go only from one to another in infinitum; who makes first
that repentance, which he afterward rewards; and gives us first to ask those
favors, which he gives us for asking.

To return to the subject in hand. Now in this 13. Moses.
time of greatest necessity God sent Moses: whose law was given for a light to
the feet of the sons of faith; as for a letter of condemnation to the sons of
Belial. About 400 years after, Act. 13. 20. when the Israelites were quite
declined from the pious steps of their forefathers; and the word of the Lord
(upon it) for a long time, had been rare and precious, See Judge. 2. 10. 1 Samuel
3. 1. God sent Samuel, Samuel and David.
David, etc. 500. years after this; all relapsed into idolatry; and in their
captivity little amendment; see Ezra 9. 1. Zech. 7. 5. etc. just when ten
foredecreed Sabbaths of years for the land (whose Sabbaths among other things
by them were not observed) see Lev. 26. 34. 2 Chronicles. 36. 21. were run out: God
for his names sake sent a restorement of their Church and government by
Zerubbabel and Joshua. Zerubbabel and Joshuah.
Near the end of 70 Sabbaths or weeks of years, i. e. 490 years Dan. 9. 25.
after this, when we know what a miserable condition the Church of God was in,
from the wickedness of the High Priest; the superstition and hypocrisy, and
false doctrines of the Pharisee, when there was now hoc dignus (...) nodus; God
sent his son to reform all things Heb. 9. 19. And His own Son.
we may gather also from Romans 11. 26, 27, 28, 29. that the last conversion of
this nation, shall be only for Gods promise, not their repentance. And indeed
who so considers that from God proceeds all our reformation; as well as his
blessings for, and upon it; for all the effects of mercy must wholly acquiesce
in him; and acknowledge all things always done for his own sake; nothing for
ours. These s^t and foremeasured times of performing these purposes of God the
Evangelist has otherwise observed in the 14 generations; that were between
those great Epocha's of Abraham and David; David and the Captivity; Captivity
and Christ. Matt. 1. 17.

And now what can hinder Gods goodness; or decay. 14 God for ^ver preservin^

the Church; since it is plain that sin cannot? God preserving it not for its
holiness, but his glory. To whose power Satan is so far inferior; that tho he
is permitted to work much sin in the world; yet was he never, nor never shall
be, able to frustrate by sin any of the least of Gods designs. And therefore
that supposition is not pious, of his assisting the Church so far as she
neglects not her duty: which is only promising, that the Church shall not (if
it does not) fall away; for so doubtless it had been, long since many times
over, perished: And Gods enemy have had the universal Monarchy of this lower
world. But as from him only it is that the Churches faith continues; so his
promise that she shall not, is also that* her faith shall not, fail; see Luke
22. 32. comp. with Matt. 16. 18. And the motives of Gods protection of Her are
now the same as of old, (wherewith his servants, upon the rising of his
indignation against her, always conjured him); i. e. not respect to her
righteousness; but the care of his name: least it (either the power or glory
thereof) should be polluted amongst Christ's spiritual enemies, Satan and his
Angels: and temporal, Antichrist and his worshippers; whilst he seemed unable
to protect her. [Hence the jealousy of Gods and Christ's name, amongst the
Mahometans now, no less then amongst the Heathen before, shall secure
Christianity.] See Numb. 14. 16. Who is now also as jealous as ever of his
honor; and says as of old, Ps. 46. 10. I will be exalted amongst the Heathen,
etc. Or the truth and faithfulness thereof should be aspersed amongst his
servants; after so many promises and oaths made (for besides those latter of
the new Testament, even that old one to Abraham (which was concerning his
spiritual seed) is no way yet canceld or expired), if he should appear unready
to preserve her. See Exodus 32. 13. And in that great judgment Matt. 24. 21.
from which some are saved, he says not for the righteous, but for the elect
tho e days shall be shortened: i. e. for his election of some to whom he will
show mercy: which election Romans 9. 11. is of God calling, not man working; who
creates repentance, as well as shows favor upon it; and who of a sudden brings
an holy generation out of a corrupt. Whose omnipotency delights to exercise it
self in changing even curses themselves into blessings. As we see in the curse
of Adam; Satan's mischiefs upon Eve, being the occasion (in cursing him) of
promising the blessed seed. Genesis 3. 15. In the curse of Babel; by it peopling
the world, Genesis 11. 8. -10. 2. etc. Of Levi's race, Genesis 49. 7. whose
scattering in Israel became their preeminence in the employment of the ministry
of holy things. Numb. 16. 9. Of Christ, Gal. 3. 13. the killing of whom by
Satan's great plotting and malice, became the salvation of the world. The
Babilonian Captivity, which ('it is observed) much advanced in the world the
knowledge of the true God, and prudent laws. The prosecuting of the death of
Stephen, and destruction of the Christians; by which the Gospel was spread over
the world. Act. 8. 4. Onesimus his running away, Philem. 15. his conversion.
Glory be unto his omnipotency and wisdom out of weakness producing strength;
and good out of evil! Amen. And again whose unsearchable counsel does not ty
and restrain it self to prosper all good intentions and pious designs of those,
who are zealous for propagating his Church, either by converting Heathens to
the christian faith; or Heretical Christians to the truth. And this only
because his preappointed time of mercy to such a people is not yet come: who
for their sins are yet longer to suffer the just judgment of blindness and
error; And it is not for men to know the times and seasons which the Father
has put in his own power; much less to take up the sword unbidden in his
cause; being an Engine he hitherto has not used, to promote religion. And
perhaps therefore it has been (tho I am persuaded sometimes drawn out of pure
zeal to Gods honor) hitherto so unsuccesful. Witness, those many unfortunate
attempts upon the Mahometans in several parts, by Christian Princes in the
Holy war: By Lewis 9th, by Charles 5th, etc. Toward which enemy of Christian
religion (since he has attained his just bounds) their defenses have been
wonderfully successful; not so their invasions. And since the last divisions in
the Church 1500. the many as unprosperous civil wars of Christians amongst
themselves. As on one side the famous invasion of the Swedes, the attempts of
the Reformed in the Low Countries; in France; On the other side the invasion of
88; The powderconspiracy; the late insurrection of the Romanists in Ireland,
etc. without any considerable advantage to that side (which ever it be) that is
orthodox.

now it does not), being not mixed with faith in many of the hearers. Heb. 4. 2.
And first for the law Ceremonial; it was nothing but the Gospel in symbol and
type; and therefore is not abolished by the Gospel when fully manifested, but
only by being completed and improved; as the Gospel in shadow by the Gospel in

with the Covenant of the Gospel, not one title of it being expunged; but
(rather) as some think much enlarged; and a stricter observance thereof then by
Moses, required by our Savior. See Ma^t. 5. 17, 18. comp. 19, 20. Romans 8. 4. 1
Cor. 7. 19. And it was included and presupposed in the Covenant of grace
transacted with Abraham. Genesis 18. 19. Why then should we think that the law
given at Sinai did not well accord with the Gospel, that was then also
preached? Heb. 4. 2. Nay, that more perfect knowledge of Gods will, the giving
of the law to Jacob, etc. whilst other nations walking in darkness were not so
dealt with, Ps. 147. 19. is quoted as a great privilege and favor to that
people by the Apostle, Romans 3. 2. -2. 18. -9. 4. (where the Apostle reckons
among benefits not only the promises, and one Covenant, but the Covenants and
the giving of the law) and rejoiced in, as such every where by the Psalmist,
Ps. 119. -147. 20. which rendered them (I mean the sons of faith not of works)
much more holy and less sinners, then generally the Gentiles were: see Gal. 2.
15. being a lantern to the feet of the children of the spirit; as a letter of
condemnation to those of the flesh: and in that it is said to bring nothing to
perfection, Heb. 7. 19. being intimated to have the power to advance men some
steps toward it. For tho the law was not the Gospel; nor the ministration of
the letter the same with that of the spirit; nor that of Moses with that of
Christ; yet one was subservient and a precognitum unto the other. And it was
first in order to receive the precept, to tell us what is to be performed; and
then the spirit to enable us to perform it, (tho without the spirit also we
never perfectly know it.) Therefore the first law-giving was to Adam as soon as
created; and to it answered especially the divulging of the Gospel to Abraham:
again the law was set forth again, and as it were reprinted by Moses at Sinai;
and to it answered the manifestation and last edition of the Gospel by Christ
coming in the flesh. Yet tho thus the law is before the Gospel in order of
nature, yet not in time: for even Adam himself as he had an external command to
observe, (which was the letter of the law) so had he the spirit to enable him
for it; and that the same spirit which is to us restored by the Gospel.

The ministration therefore of the law by Moses. 16. Tho to the children of
works a killing letter.
(taken single and abstractively by it self, from the ministration of the
spirit, which was also administered at the same time (tho not in its great
solemnity) to the children of the promise and of faith, tho not by Moses), was
of nothing but the letter; and that letter a killing one; impressed in stone
but not upon the heart; the the ministration of death, 2 Cor. 3. 7. a Covenant
faulty, i. e. defective; and no salvation by it; but the promise annexed was
only He that does, shall live, in them; a sentence of condemnation (and so it
(accidentally) happened to be then, as now also,) to those who were of works
and not of faith, Gal. 3. 9, 10. to those who had the administration of the
letter only, and not of the spirit. In which sense taken, all things are said
in its disparagement ( the law ceremonial making nothing perfect, the moral all
fuller of sin); and all those oppositions of the law to the Gospel: and of
Moses to Christ. See Heb. 8. 9. Therefore where the Apostle makes any such
opposition; it is either of the more obscure manifestation of the Gospel and
promises in the times under the law, in respect of those after the incarnation
of Christ: Or of the law Ceremonial, sometimes also called the old Covenant, in
respect of its accomplishment in Christ; (as this occurs often in the Epistle
to the Hebrews) Or not of the book of the old Testament, i. e. of Moses and the
Prophets, to the new Testament, i. e. of the Gospel of our Savior, (for thus
the new Testament is also contained in, and proved out of the old,) but of the
law moral considered by it self in the old Testament, (and abstracted there
from all the promises of Gods mercy and of grace, that are frequent in it,)
only as it rigidly commands all righteousness; forbids all sin; promises
rewards to those that keep; denounces punishments to those that transgress it;
and meanwhile changes not, helps not at all man's natural pravity, and
inability to observe it. Yet thus also; as the letter only, it served well, by
showing men their sins and inability to perform them, to drive them forward Yet
(...) to drive them (made sensible of their inability) forward into the
Covenant of Grace.
with the rod of this Schoolmaster into the Covenant of grace, see Romans 3. 19,
21. -9. 32. Gal. 3. 22, 24. and to make them look after a Redeemer, by seeing
how guilty they stood before God; and after the spirit promised and procured by
him, by seeing their former self-weakness (which spirit and redeemer then also
offered themselves to the children of faith.) Tho many of the Israelites abused
this intention of the law, by seeking justification by it, rather then by
faith: Romans 9. 32. whilst meanwhile the ministration of the spirit, see 2 Cor.
3. 6, 7, 8. Romans 8. 2. Heb. 8. 10, 11. writ it upon the hearts of the faithful;
by which spirit as the just lived; and had remission of former sins (committed
against this law) by faith. Psalm. 32. 1, 2. Romans 4. 7, 8. So he was enabled
(for the future) to walk in those same laws; see Luke 1. 6. Romans 8. 4. The law
standing still in force as subordinate unto grace, 1 Cor. 9. 21. for our works
following faith and repentance; (tho not for those preceding them) to which law
we are always to perform both sincere and universal obedience. These two
ministrations therefore of the law and of the spirit are opposed, for their
effect: one taken single, by itself without the other, serving only for
conviction and condemnation, etc. and for the persons by whom they came; one by
Moses, the other by Christ; but not for the time, or for the time also; but not
as if in time (I mean since Adams fall) the one preceded the other for their
absolute being, but only in respect of the clearer manifestation first of the
one, then of the other; at several times. In the former times the law being
more largely propounded; the promises seen a far off and darkly, as it were
through a cloud or veil; 2 Cor. 3. 13. The Messiah expected to appear in the
flesh; the gift of the spirit narrower for compass, less in intention: But the
latter times, from it now visibly sent down from Heaven enjoying clearer
manifestations of truth, larger effusions of grace. 1 Cor- 9. 10. To conclude.
As we find before the law from the beginning, a double generation, one sons of
God; and the other of men: one righteous and the other wicked; and in Abraham's
time one born of the bondwoman, another of the freewoman; now those born of
the freewoman are only such as are made free by Christ, see Gal. 4. 31. -5. 1.
one born after the flesh; the other after the spirit, or by promise. (Now the
spirit is the promise of the Gospel, as well as the Messiah, and comes only by
the Messiah) one ex operibus, the other ex vocante, Romans 9. 11. which two
generations, (from the beginning) were also showed in the opposition between
the elder and the younger; (as in Cain whose race was gigantick in comparision
of the other. Genesis 6. 4. and Abel, or Seth: Ismael, Isaac: Esau, Jacob: Ham and
Shem, etc. Which may be observed also in Reuben and Judah; Zarah and Pharez;
Manasses and Ephraim; David and his brethren; Aaron and Moses; (And not only in
persons, but nations; ancienter and greater nations, against that chosen for
Gods people, Israel and the Egyptian: Israel and the Canaanites: Israel and the
Philistine: Israel and Babylon; Jew and Antiochus; Jew and Gentile; then
Gentile the people of God and the Jew Apostate: lastly, the Church and
Antichrist. The Elder persecuting the younger, or the former born, the latter;
but yet the latter still overcoming the former; for that which is first is
natural. 1 Cor. 15. 46.

So under the law also we find a twofold generation;. 17. The two ministrations
of the law by Moses; and the spirit by Christ, how and how not opposed.
one of faith holding of Abraham; another of works of the law, holding of
Moses, Gal. 3. 9, 10. and two Covenants on foot; the one the Mount Sinai; and
the other the Jerusalem-Covenant. Gal. 4. 25. and two explanations upon them,
to guide men to which covenant they should adhere; the one [ Cursed is every
one that continues not in all things written in the law to do them; and He
that does, shall live, in them. Romans 10. 5. Gal. 3. 12. quoting Deuteronomy. 17. 26.
Levit. 18. 5.] The other [ The just shall live by faith]; or Blessed is the man
whose iniquities are forgiven. See Romans 3. 3, 7, 8. Gal. 3. 10, 12, 11. Romans 4.
3. -9. 33. quoting Psalm. 32. 1, 2. Habbak. 2. 4. Esai. 28. 16. Genesis 15. 6. Nay
see both these coming from the mouth of Moses, who himself was a Son of faith.
The one Levit. 18. 5. the other Deuteronomy. 13. 11, 12. explained by the Apostle,
Romans 10. 5, 6, 7. etc. The latter of which [ The word is nigh thee, in thy
heart, etc.] that is, says he, the word of faith; and that same faith which
the Gospel preaches, verse. 8. And therefore as we are now referred for
salvation to the preaching of Christ and his Apostles; so Abraham then (before
these) referred Dives his brethren for their salvation and escaping of hell to
the preaching of Moses and the Prophets. Luke 16. 29, 31. And both St. Paul and
St. James, treating about the point of justification, take their examples out
of the old Testament; instancing, how it was in Abraham amongst the Hebrews,
and Rahab amongst the Gentiles. See Romans 4. 1. etc. Jam. 2. 21, 25. And as the
other held of Adam and the law; so these latter in all ages held of Christ and
the Gospel: and The Ancients had a ways the same way of salvation as the
latter times.
(as we now) had always the same Savior, their King to conduct them; the same
spirit to inspire and inform them; the same Sacraments (for substance) to
confirm them: Baptism in the Red sea and in the Cloud, through which see Exodus 14.
19, -13. 21. Matt. 3. 11. they passed to Canaan: and the Eucharist; the body of
our Lord in the Manna, coming down from Heaven; and his blood in the water,
streaming out of the rock. 1 Cor. 10. 1. etc. So Circumcision was administered,
and their sacrifices used by them, as Baptism and the Eucharist by us: (of
which instituted by the Lord Jesus theirs delivered to the fathers were types)
for remission of sin, and conferring grace, for appeasing Gods wrath, and
thanksgiving for mercies with reference to the same blood of the new Testament,
and the only true sacrifice. So St. Austin de nuptiis and concupiscentia. l.
2. c. 11. says Circumcisionem ad purgationem originalis peccati valuisse
magnis and parvis, quemadmodum nunc Baptismus. And that threat Genesis 17. 14.
That soul shall be cut off from his people is ordinarily understood; that he is
cut off as well for being extra pactum, as being praecepti violati reus. And
tho Circumcision in Abraham (who was before the receipt thereof justified by
faith) was only a seal of that former justification; as also the Sacrament of
Baptism was to Cornelius (says St. Austin contra Donatistas. l. 4. c. 24.) See
Act. 10. 47. comp. 44. and is to many other. Yet this hinders not (says Estius
4. Sent. 1. d. 31. sec.) but that in parvulissicut nunc Baptismus, ita olim
Circumcisio non nudum esset signaculum justitiae interioris, sed efficax atque
operatorium. And St. Austin ibid. Cur ergo ei praeceptum est ut omnem deinceps
infantem octavo die circumcideret; nisi quia and ipsum per seipsum sacramentum
multum valebat? And for this purpose also were their sacrifices used. See Lev.
4. 20, 26. and the Priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his
sin and it shall be forgiven him. Vulgar; Rogabitque pro eo Sacerdos and pro
peccato ejus, and dimittetur ei. See Lev. cap. ^. cap. 17. and Numb. 15. cap.
and Heb. 5. 1. That he might offer sacrifices for sins, so Job c. 1. v. 5.
offered sacrifice for the sins of his sons, and 42. cap. 8, and v. 9. he
offered sacrifice and prayed for the trespasses of his friends, and God
accepted him. See the same 2 Samuel 24. 25. How like is that Lev. 4. 26. in the
old Testament to Jam. 5. 14, 15. in the new, for remission of sin by the
Priests using sacred ceremonies and prayer? and that Deuteronomy. 34. 9. to Act. 8.
17. for conferring of the graces of the spirit? Therefore thus St. Austin
Quaest. 84. in Levit. Moses sanctificabat visibilibus sacramentis per
ministerium suum, Dominus invisibili gratia per spiritum suum. And Tract. 26.
in Johan. he says Sacramenta Judaeorum and nostra fuisse in signis diversa; in
re, quae significatur, paria: quoting 1 Cor. 10. 2, 3. Omnes eandem escam
spiritualem manducaverant, spiritualem utique eandem quam nos. Aliud illi,
aliud nos, sed specie visibili, quod tamen hoc idem significaret virtute
spirituali. To which I will add two sayings of Leo, the one Sermon. 3. de
Nativit. Domini. Non minus adepti qui in illud magnae pietatis sacramentum
credidere promissum, quam qui suscepere donatum. The other Sermon. 1. in die
Pentecost. Cum in die Pentecostes discipulos Domini spiritus sanctus implevit,
non fuit inchoatio muneris, sed adjectio largitatis. Quoniam and Patriarchae
and Prophetae and Sacerdotes, omnesque Sancti, qui prioribus fuere temporibus,
ejusdem sunt spiritus sancti sanctificatione vegetati; and sine hac gratia
nulla unquam instituta sacramenta, nulla sunt celebrata mysteria, ut eadem
semper fuerit virtus charismatum, quamvis non eadem fuerit mensura donorum.
Indeed the Sacraments of the old Testament considered in themselves, as
separate from, or opposite to, the merit of Christ and the grace of the Gospel,
were of no power for expiating sin, or conferring grace. We find the Sacrifices
also instituted in Levit. for lesser sins: those of ignorance; those offending
against some legal rites, and ceremonies; those damaging our neighbor in some
smaller matters, joined with restitution; but not for expiation of the great
ones, murder, idolatry, blasphemy, or adultery; and for these lesser sins we
may not imagine them expiatory of the guilt, or sin in it self (save as they
foresignified the merits of the Sacrifice on the Cross, and thus strengthened
the faith of the offerer in the promises to come: for which faith obeying Gods
command in offering to him these Types thereof, the merits of the Sacrifice of
the Cross was applied to him for remission of his sin, great, or little) but
only of the legal immundicities, or some temporal penalties due thereto; which
sacrifices therefore were of themselves quotidiana peccatorum accusatio, but
not solutio, as St. Chrysostom in Heb. Hom. 17. Therefore also where we find
discourse in the Prophets of remission of sin, as in Ezekiel. 18. chap. the
legal Sacrifices are not proposed as any remedy thereof; and many times spoken
of in the old Testament as unprofitable thereunto. And what is said here of the
common, and ordinary Sacrifices, is to be said for those more solemn ones,
offered once a year, on the great day of expiation, which are extensible only
to the same ends, and purposes, as the ordinary Sacrifices were. Again, these
Sacrifices also for the expiation of the exterior immundicity, and punishment
of the lesser sins (for which they were ordained) in this came short of that
all-sufficient Sacrifice of our Lord: that they neither procured such
indulgence from God for any future sin of the same kind, but so many sins as
were committed, so many several Sacrifices were to be slain, and offered: nor
procured from him any grace, or special assistance of his Spirit for the
prevention of such future sins. But left those for whom they were offered as
liable to the same sins, as they were before, whereas our Lords one oblation
made satisfaction for all future sins as well as past; and also procured from
God the plentiful effusion of the Holy Spirit, and Grace for preventing of a
relapse into sin for the future. This then was the great weakness, and
unprofitableness of the Sacraments, and Sacrifices of the Law. Heb. 7. 18.
Therefore the Apostle calls them but beggarly elements, Gal. 4. 9. and in the
9. and 10. chapter to the Hebrews denies they could take away sin, etc. and in
many places speaks against the unprofitableness of circumcision, etc. (as also
many things are said in the old Testament in disparagement of the sacrifices
under the law.) But as Estius 4. Sent. 1d. 28 s. methinks well notes. Quae ab
Apostolo (and so I may say of those things said by the Prophets) contra Judaeos
proprie dicta sunt, qui Christum solum justificatorem ignorantes signa pro
rebus amplectebantur; existimantes sacrificia and sacramenta veteris legis per
seipsa deo accepta and propitiatoria esse, ut Christi sanguine opus non esset.

And the same thing may be said of John Baptists. 18.
baptism, which, tho certainly as relating to the blood of Christ we cannot
imagine that it was inferior, in its effects to the former Sacraments
administered before or under the law to those who died not having the
opportunity of receiving our Saviors after it; yet first considered in it
self, and as the Jews looked upon it as an external washing only coming from
John it was, as he told them, only a Baptism of water, not of the spirit. He
administering no more then the external sign only; but Christ, that came after
him, the inward Grace, for that measure thereof, that was in John's Baptism, as
in other old-Testament-Sacraments, received. Secondly, Tho in his Baptism, or
other former Sacraments to the rightly prepared Grace might be and was
received, yet was there no descent of the Holy Ghost, or donation of those
higher gifts or Graces thereof (which externally manifested its internal
presence, and therefore (...) had the name of the Holy Ghost, see Act. 8. 17.
Act. 1. 8. -10. 44. -19. 6. comp. 2, 3. of which doubtless the Baptist speaks,
Matt. 3. 11. distributed, save extraordinarily, till the coming of our Lord and
by his Missioners; the first effusion thereof being at Pentecost, and so
continuing ever since more frequent in the Church as to several of these
eminent gifts thereof, to and upon so many, whose hearts, and conversation are
very much purified from sin; for which therefore John was sent before our Lord
to prepare the world by a due repentance and reformation, our Lord not vouchsa
fing to put this new wine save into new vessels: for defect of which, even in
these latter times of the Gospel also, the donation of the Holy Ghost taken in
this sense is not so common. It must be granted then that the former Sacraments
also, as they referred to Christ, yet were many ways inferior in the benefit
received by them, to those instituted by our Savior after the mystery of our
salvation accomplished. Veteribus sublatis (says S. Austin) instituta sunt
nova, virtute majora, utilitate meliora, actu faciliora, numero pauciora, and
Leo (quoted before) eadem fuit virtus charismatum, quamvis non eadem fuit
mensura donorum, and this may be the reason of those 2 Canons in the Council.
Trident. 7. Session. Siquis dixerit novae legis sacramenta a sacramentis
antiquae legis non differ nisi quia ceremoniae sunt aliae, and alii ritus
externi: Anathema sit. And again, si quis dixerit Baptismum Johannis habuisse
eandem vim cum baptismo Christi, Anathema sit. Which was also the Ancient
doctrine of the Church against the Donatists pleading from it the lawfulness of
the iteration of Christ's baptism. To whom St. Austin replies contra literas
Petiliani l. 2. c. 37. Sicut aliud est carnis circumcisio Judaeorum, aliud
autem quod octavo die Baptizatorum nos ^elebramus: and aliud est Pascha quod
adhuc illi ^e ove celebrant, aliud autem quod nos in corpore and sanguine
Domini accipimus; sic alius fuit Baptismus Johannis, alius est baptismus
Christi: Illis enim ventura ista praenunciabantur, (...) completa illa
praedicantur. Thus Calvin also Instit. l. 4. c. 14. 22. Quin uberior etiam
spiritus gratia hic (i. e. in the Sacraments of the new Testament) se proferat,
si tempus cum tempore compares non dubium est: Nam id pertinet ad gloriam regni
Christi, sicut ex plurimis locis praesertim ex 7 capite Johan. colligimus: Quo
sensu accipere oportet illud Pauli, umbras fuisse sub lege, Corpus sub Christo.
Neque enim consilium est exinanire suo effectu testimonia gratiae in quibus
olim Patribus veracem se probare deus voluit, sed comparative magni facere quod
nobis datum est. And I think no Christian has reason to equal the benefits of
their Manna or Paschal Lamb to those of the Eucharist instituted by the Lord
Jesus, with annullation of the other; and a preface of Hoc est corpus meum,
which seems needless innovation, if as much might have been said of the former
Lamb. See Bishop Forbes de Eucharist. l. 1. c. 1. s. 26. Haud dubie prisci
fideles ante Christi incarnationem carnem Christi spiritualiter edebant in
Manna, and rebus aliis figuratam, and sufficienter pro statu oeconomiae illius
ad salutem 1 Cor. 10. etc. sed nihilominus per communicationem carnis Christi
in Eucharistia multo altius and solidius nos Christianos incorporari Christo
quam priscos fideles, qui Christi incarnationem praecesserant: And again. Eadem
fuit Judaeorum and Christianorum esca quoad significationem, non autem quoad
rei significat^ and figuratae praesentiam and exhibitionem. Haud absurd igitur
dicitur Agnum paschalem, Mannam, pe ram etc. fuisse Sacramenti Eucharistiae
typos and figuras, etc. And if any one think to equal the benefit of the new
Sacraments with those old ones because salvation was also had under them, He
must also deny any profit thereof also now to people formerly penitent and
believers: because these also prevented of the actual reception of these
Sacraments may attain eternal life. Thus it is confessed the former Sacraments
to be in many degrees inferior to the new instituted by Christ. The Schoolmen
go yet further in depressing them. Non valuisse sacrificia vetera, etc. ad
expiationem peccati quoad culpam and paenam Gehennae, nisi quatenus signa
quaedam erant protestantia fidem in Christum. Non justificasse vi sua (as the
new ones do) sed ex fide and devotione suscipientis, quae fides nunc non
efficit gratiam sacramentalem, neque dat efficaciam sacramentis, sed solum
tollit obstacula. Instituta esse primo and per se ad significationem fut^rorum
(according to that of St. Austin non dantia salutem, sed promittentia
salvatorem) non ad efficiendum aliquid ^isi per accidens, quatenus in eorum
susceptione erat protestatio sidei, etc. Yet (to conclude) How ever be it per
se, or be it per accidens, it is granted by all that the same effects for
remission of sin, and grace necessary to salvation according to the economy of
those imperfecter times, were wrought in the receiving of those Sacraments as
since in the new. So Aquin. part. 3. 62. q. 6. art. confesses per
Circumcisionem Gratiam fuisse collatam quantum ad omnes gratiae effectus, sicut
in Baptismo non tamen ex virtute ipsius Circumcisionis sicut per Baptismum. And
Bellarmine. Meritum Christi nobis applicatur per sacramenta, Hebraeis autem per
solum fidem: But he adds quae tamen fides requirebat sacramenta vetera ut
conditiones sine quibus non fides operabatur. Yet since more abundance of grace
and salvation comes by the new, more immediately and properly instituted by our
Savior for such an effect; Therefore were the new much desired by (and we are
not to doubt) with much benefit administered, to those who had formerly received
the other; which were also the types and figures of these. And Blessed ever be
God who has made our times partakers of these his more excellent benefits and
dispensations.

The same way of salvation; first, by remission of. 19.

of faith being guided by the same Evangelical precepts, regenerated by the
same spirit; and this spirit operating the same purity and sanctity in their
hearts, under the old Testament, as under the new. Neither may we think that
the latter Saints more illuminated differed from the ancient more oreshadowed,
in the perfection of any new parts of obedience, but only in the perfection of
degrees. Nor (for degrees) was their illumination so small (and consequently
their obedience so The same obedience t^en required and performed.
impure), in comparison of us as some imagine. Which thing, after first having
taken notice, that the two greatest Commandments which indeed contain all the
rest whatsoever Romans 13. 10. are quoted by our Savior out of ehe law and
Prophets. Deuteronomy. 6. 5. Lev. 19. 18. see Matt. 22. 37. -7. 12. We may the better
discern by running over the strictest precepts of our Saviors Sermon, Matt. 5.
etc. and seeing how far those of the Law and Prophets have advanced toward
them, tho the supine negligence or hypocrisy of the Jewish Doctors took notice
only of some places (for the outward expression) of less restraint; as Thou
shall not kill, commit adultery, forswear thy self, etc. without considering
others at all that were of greater.

and the censure of Nabal for calling David a runaway. 1 Samuel 25. 14. And indeed
the general precept of the law [ loving our neighbor as our self, and doing
only to him, what we would he should to us] sufficiently involves the
prohibition. To our Saviors, Matt. 5. 27. see Prove. 6. 25. Job. 31. 1. Prove.
5. 8. where advised to turn another way. Jer. 5. 8. Is our Saviors stricter
then Prove. 23. 31, 33. And lastly the 10th Commandment; from which we may
argue; If (now) the eye look, etc. without coveting, it is innocent: if with it,
then also this was a sin. To those Matt. 5. 33. see the third Commandment; and
our Saviors reason for not swearing, Matt. 5. 37. Which reason [ of its coming
of evil] argues that it was never lawful; and (consequently) always forbidden;
either by the positive, or the natural, divine law. Now tho we find not in the
positive law [ swear not at all] (which precept is in no times to be understood
absolutely); yet we find that we shall only swear by the Lords name Deuteronomy. 6.
13. -10. 20. (for swearing by him was his honor, Esai. 65. 16. Jer. 2. 16.)
and again that we shall never take his name in vain. Therefore they might not
swear at all; unless upon necessary and just causes; But so also we may now
swear. And see this in St. Paul not unfrequent. To that Matt. 5. 38. see Prove.
20. 22. -24. 29. Lev. 19. 18. Tooth for tooth (for public revenge) is still

But so also it is now, Gal. 6. 10. Now concerning these precepts above quoted we
may not think that they were unknown or unpractised till the time wherein we
find them registered. For we find not only the morals of Moses, but even many of
the ceremonials, observed before his times; As paying tithes, Genesis 14. 20.

gathered from Genesis 6. 2. comp. 1. And so Polygamy seems then prohibited. See
Matt. 19. 4, 8. comp. Genesis 6. 2. and 4. 19. Raising seed to their brother. Genesis
38. 8, 10. But they happened rather to be registered and set down by parts, what
the Holy Ghost always on the same manner dictated to the faithful; as those
sins also were by them strictly avoided. Else the holiness of ancient Noah and
Job would not have run parallel with that of Daniel, Ezekiel. 14. 14. which in the
10 Commandments were only reductively prohibited. This publication of the
divine laws being still more and more perfect; Moses more illustrating, and
commenting, as it were, upon the former patriarchal Traditions; and the
Prophets upon those of Moses; and Christ again upon those of the Prophets; he
completing and fulfilling all things.

was by sufferings. Self-denial, taking up the Cross, mortification,
affliction, as they are the portion of the godly under the new, so were they
under the old Testament: and the same promises of protection, deliverance,
temporal happiness and prosperity, that were to the righteous under the old,
are also to the Saints under the new. And as the present state of the wicked is
observed to be prosperous since our Saviors coming, but endless destruct on
after it; so it was before. And they are Gods constant ways, from the
beginning never changed; first affliction, then deliverance; first evil, then
good to the godly: first prosperity, then ruin; first good, then evil, to the
impious. But who so will universally discern these paths of God by his
experience, must first perfectly see the goodness and wickedness of the heart
(where their chief seat is) to distinguish between the good and the bad; and
then must see the joys and afflictions of the heart (where their chief seat
is) to distinguish between the truly temporally happy, and the miserable.
Besides these he must see to what place the soul goes when it leaves the body;
and to what place also the body goes when it leaves the grave: for t e reasons,

persons, but not so with nations; because they had promises of temporal
happiness then upon holiness, first: and have they not so still? Does not God
still temporally bless both persons and nations that fear and serve him? the
preachers tell them so. And for righteous men are there none now that may say
with David, Psalm. 16. 6? But if temporal prosperity be the promise of the law,
and affliction the lot of the Gospel; then, as then we argue Israel Gods
people, when prosperous, we must argue them so still: because now most
distressed. Nay further, them then not to be Gods people, because no nation
seems to have suffered more then the Israelites, (not to a final extirpation of
them, for whom mercy is in the last place reserved, but for all manner of
tyranny and oppression over them) if we do but together with their short
felicities in Joshua's, and David's, and Solomon's time, etc. consider their
condition in Egypt, after in the wilderness; in the time of the Judges; under
the invasions of the kings of Syria, Babylon, Egypt, Antiochus, Romans. For as
the temporal prosperity of those, who are Gods people, depends only on the
continuance of their holmess (God judging here those more, whom he will not
judge hereafter; and visiting the sins of his servants almost always with
temporal afflictions, tho he deals not so with others, because reserved for
future and greater punishments) so they never continuing long without offending
God, it comes to pass that they never long abide temporally happy. And we see
the very life of holy men not unoften ending in the temporal punishment of some
sin, as good Josiah's and Moses's, and the Corinthians 1 Cor. 11. 30. comp.

contrary Job. 42. 7, 8. Psalm. 73. 1. etc. Mal. 3. 14. Psalm. 17. 14. which
wonderment is as much now, as it was then; and proceeds not from a right
supposition of any promise God made either then or since of perpetual
prosperity to the godly, and adversity to the wicked; but from an human,
shortsighted, non-consideration of the future endless happiness of the one, and
destruction of the other: which only is the word of the Almighty and shall
stand fast for ever. But we will needs conceive their end already past; when
they are but entering upon an eternity of being. 4. That temporal prosperity
Under the new Testament temporal prosperity in some sense to the godly.
under the new Testament is not to be denied to the godly, see Mark. 10. 30. 1 Timothy 4. 8. Matt. 5. 5. comp. Psalm. 37. 11. from which it seems to be taken.
Jam. 5. 11. Where the Apostle proposes Job's reprosperity for an example to
Christians; And that long life promised to obedience to parents; and blessings
not only upon themselves, but their children, to those who obey Gods
Commandments, are since the Gospel, antiquated; and these events altered, who
dares to affirm? Or what good man is there that has not long stories of Gods
several temporal mer^ies to him in this world? And when I consider the temporal
condition of the greatest sufferers; (tho it is true 1 Cor. 15. 19. to the eye
of men, and the little enjoyment of any good things of this life, they are of
all men most miserable) yet in such condition, for the present, also they seem
of men the most happy (only if you suppose their hopes to be true): for I find
them, tho not freed from adversities; yet always sure of protection in, and
deliverance from, them. See S. Paul's words 2 Cor. 1. 10. and 2 Timothy 4. 17, 18.
agreeing with the doctrine of Ps. 37. and Ps. 34. 19. So that his bonds assured
with such mercies made others bold, and Phil. 1. 12. etc. and their joys solid
and true and not counterfeit, and far exceeding, and making them even senseless
of their sorrows: see 2 Cor. 1. and when I look on their life ending in a
violent, painful, and ignominious death, yet when I consider the wages for it;
it seems that it ought not to be called an affliction, but an extraordinary
service; undertaken for to attain a greater reward eternal, then others shall
have who take not the same pains. See Heb. 11. 35, 26. But concerning temporal
prosperity of Saints two things we must note. 1. That it is not for the most
part so constant as the wicked's is (see the reason before) because all men
sinning; the just God punishes in this world those of his servants, etc. (the
reason of this because he punishes them not hereafter:) but (according to the
qualification inserted Mark. 10. 30.) interlined with afflictions; and consists
more in protection in and deliverance from, then vacancy of, all crosses (yet
which things make it to them infinitely more pleasant; as war and conquest is,
then a constant peace: and hunger and a feast then constant satiety): and that
it is a happiness as succeeding evils; so succeeded by them, like the condition
described, Psalm. 106. but good and peace always the last. Ps. 37. 37. 2. That
when it is, it is more secret, and within, and less discerned; whereas that of
the wicked is more external, and specious, and obvious to the eye. So that the
world sees much more of the one and much less of the other then indeed there
is. To conclude this point from the premises I think we may safely pronounce.
1. That a constant prosperity (excepting some evils of no moment) has
sometimes happened to the wicked; but never to any good man. 2. That constant
adversity never happened either to evil or good. Not to the evil, because they
purchase evil to come only by the pleasures of some present sins* nor to the
good because God delivers as he afflicts. 3. That to the good, more worldly
dissatisfaction, then worldly content, either from his not having, or at least
his not using and enjoying, its good things, 1 Cor. 7. 29. has always
happened. 4. That for the people and Church of God in general; ever since the
beginning, the latter afflictions thereof have been and shall be still greater;
greater therefore under the times of the Gospel, then of the law; see Matt. 10.
34. and greater still the deliverances; all Glory be to the infinite wisdom of
our God!

Thus much of the same obedience and sufferings, 22. 3 The same rewards eternal
then promised.
required always of the children of faith, under the times of the law and
Prophets; as since under the times of Christ; even the same from the beginning.
Next, these required always upon the same rewards promised and punishments
denounced, i. e. eternal bliss, or torments: which that they were always
believed, hoped, feared by the most of men Punishments eternal threatened.
(for now also some there are who believe them not) we may learn from the
ancient universality of this opinion (for so much as concerns the soul) even
The common belief of all nations concerning these.
amongst false religions; which must either be borrowed from the relations of
it made to the Church, (as all false religions were but several corruptions of
the true): or from the common light of nature (as such a thing there is, Romans
2. 14, 15.) For indeed how could at any time right reason allowing only a God;
and reward and punishment; for virtue and vice; as it is, Genesis 4. 7. argue
otherwise? For they seeing the wicked many times here prosperous; and the
righteous suffer; even the first good man murdered by his own brother: and then
holding after death no second state, there remains no punishment, etc. for
temporal death, passing upon all, can be no punishment of any ones sin, except
Adams, any more, then it is of the sins of all. Now the light we find amongst
the ancient Heathens we may not deny to have shined much more in the Church.
But secondly, That not only future Of the Ancient (...) a resurrection of the

bliss and pains, but a resurrection also was commonly believed in the Church
before our Saviors times, encouraging the good, affrighting the wicked, see 2
Maccab. 12. 44. Wisd. 4. 16. and all the 5th cap. 2 Maccab. 7. 9, 36. which tho
not Canonical yet are convincing, to show the Jews ancient opinion in this
point; and the last place seems to be verified by the Apostle, Heb. 11. 35. see
Martha's ready answer, Jo. 11. 20. and the opprobrium of the Sadduces for
denying it. Matt. 22. 23, 29. Of whom note, that they were a Sect not numerous;
counted generally Heretics among the people (as the Pharisees the Orthodox)
that, for the evidence of these truths therein they were forced to reject the
writings of the Prophets, and were told also by our Savior that they
understood not the writings of the law. Matt. 22. 29. And again that this
belief amongst them was of no later date, see Heb. 11. 12. etc. whence may be
collected the quality of that faith mentioned verse. 6. which (compared with the
end of the 4th verse. and beginning of 13.) must needs be believing God to be a

truth (tho the clear light we have of these things since the Gospel, makes us
fancy the darkness of former times to be far greater then it was). Concerning
which our Savior chides the Sadduces not only for not knowing the point, but
not knowing the scriptures, Matt. 22. 29. (as the Apostle likewise does the

the proof of it: as also St. Peter 2 Ep. 3. 13. for the new creation quotes

upon concession of the other; sins being our own, more then righteousness is;
and therefore if this in us obtains a reward, the other will punishment. Again
this punishment is not a temporally miserable life, (as appears before); oftener
undergon by the good then the bad; nor can it be a temporal death; because
there is no more undergon by the profanest, then the holiest; and is so far
from deterring the unbelievers of future torments, from sin; as it is made an
argument for it. [ Let us eat, etc. to morrow we die, Esai. 22. 13. 1 Cor. 15.
32.] I may go further, Neither could the loss of a pleasure to come tho
greater, yet unknown and a far off, sufficiently sway most men to loose and
forego a pleasure present and acquainted; (the worth of the one being
counterpoised by the nearness of the other.) Yet more; Neither could the danger
of incurring of some future pains make men forbear the pursuit of some present
delights; if all their joy must be bought with some sorrow; It seeming to them
no wisdom to be in pain to avoid it. It Is therefore the wisdom, and also mercy
of the Lawgiver, to appoint a penalty so high, as may abundantly serve to deter
men from the fault: and this can be only future pains; not only great, but
eternal. The severity of which, by how much it seems to us super-proportioned
to sin, so much more is it necessary and justified; since neither the fear
thereof can yet keep the most men from sin, and many also for fear of these
escape sin here; and attain to heaven, who upon a less penalty would have
entertained the enticements of vice; and lost the promised reward, and
voluntarily as it were contracted for present delight a future misery, had it
not been so unmeasurably great. 2. It Is plain, that the wicked of the old world
suffer eternal torments, see Matt. 11. 22, 24. 2 Pet. 2. 9, 10. comp. with 5,
6. and with 1 Pet. 3. 19. Jude 7. where the unclean false teachers are
threatened with the same destruction to come, as the devils, the old world, or
the Giants, Sodom, Cain, Core, etc: And hence it follows that either from the
evidence of Conscience, or of Tradition, or of Scripture, these were
sufficiently made known unto them. For tho Gods bounty may be greater then his
engagement, yet not his punishments then his threats; least he should seem to
hide the hook of our misery, only to make us swallow the bait of sin. But
thirdly, Did not Israel know, etc. Yes, See Luke 16. 29. Abraham's answer to
Dives in these torments: who it seems having not believed, till felt them
himself would fain have some warning of them sent to his Brethen; and the
Patriarch answered him they have Moses and the Prophets. And indeed we scarce
find any, or no expressions of these future pains in the new Testament but
taken out of the old. Matt. 5. 22. Gehenna or the valley of Hinnon; a pleasant
vale near Jerusalem; in which was To^het a place where children were burnt
alive to the honor of the idols; 2 King. 23. 10. Jer. 7. 31. taken out of Esai.
30. 30. where Tophet is set to signify these eternal pains. Mark. 9. 43. fire
unquenchable and never dying worm (alluding to that of the grave) out of Esai.
66. 24. R^v. 19. 20. out of Genesis 19. 24, 28. comp. with Jude 7. And these, and
many other expressions are used also in ^he old Testament; not to signify but
the same t^ing, as they are in the new: which the better to discover, we are to
take notice; 1. That all the expressions mentioning going down into darkness;
into Hell; and the pit; the place of Giants; the place of the uncircumcised; of
the slain; under, or into the lower parts of the earth; (where (in the
inferior spacious concavity thereof, the Diameter of its body amounting at
least to 7000 miles) in all likelihood, is the place of those torments. It
being farthest from light, and the mansion of the Blessed: which place seems to
be intimated Luke 8. 31. where the Devils desire they may not be sent into the
deep, but live on the earth, Mark. 5. 10.) going into destruction; death
gnawing upon them; their grave- worms never dying; never seeing light;
perishing like the beasts; their iniquity being upon their bones; being had no
more in remembrance; and being blotted out of the book of the living, etc.
signify not simply the common lot of the grave (where the righteous are said to
sleep, Esai. 57. 2. comp. 1.) or only a suddainer descent thither, by an
untimely death; (for the righteous also many times have an early decease,) but
the place of a prison and torment. 2. That the frequent threats there of Gods
coming to judgment, are often not meant of some particular temporal executions
of his wrath upon the living; but of that last general, that shall be upon all
the world: called by the Baptist the wrath to come, Matt. 3. 7. as appears by
the quotations of them in the new Testament, applied to that day. See 2 Pet. 3.
Rev. 20. 21, 22. chap. compared with the last chapters of Esai. Ezekiel. Zech.
etc. Esai. 13. 9. comp. Matt. 24. 29. 3. That the future misery of the wicked,
as it is expressed in some places by the paena sensus, so not unoften by Paena
damni.
the paena damni; only by privation of light, of life, i. e. future, of
remembrance, etc. see Psalm. 73. 18, 20. [ awakest] i. e. in the morning of the
resurrection, as Psalm. 39. 14. and Psalm. 17. 15. comp. with 24. 4. and with Job
21. 13. [ in a moment, i. e. without such languishing pains as Job had] 32.
where they are intimated to die without much pain, as well as live in much
prosperity. If therefore after such pleasures their destruction means only
death; death many times peaceable and easy: what preeminence over them at any
time has the Godly? why may he not then bless himself? and others also praise
his providence? Psalm. 49. 18. Psalm. 49. 14, 19, 20. where by perishing like
beasts, and death gnawing upon them; and never again seeing light, is expressed
their paena damni, their condemnation to utter darkness; and non-restorement to
life eternal; as appears comparing them with verse. 15. and Psalm. 16. 11. And
such are those expressions, Psalm. 9. 5, 17, 7, 8. chiefly intending the last
day of judgment and vengeance. See Psalm. 69. 27, 28. comp. with Exodus 32. 33.
and Phil. 4. 3. Psalm. 17. 14. Esai. 26. 14. comp. 19. But for their opinion of
paena sensus too; See the opinion of latter times, Wisd. 4. Paena s^nsus.
20. comp. with 5. 1. -6. 6, 8. of the former; in the ancientest testimony in
the world, that of Enoch the Prophet. Jude 14, 15. He speaks so early of the
last judgment: frequently appealed to in the old Testament tho mistaken, see
Ps. 2. 9. compared with Rev. 2. 27. -19. 15. See Fsai. 30. 33. -33. 14. comp.
16. -66. 24. These compared with Job. 26. 5, 6. where the Vulgar and Diodat [
(...) gigantes gemunt sub aquis and qui habitant cum eis] and 1 Pet. 3. 19. and
Esai. 14. 9, 12. suscitavit tibi gigantes, 15, 18, 19. Prove. 2. 18. and 9. 18.
The dead, the Giants as in the other i. e. the wicked of the old world; and
condemnation to the place where these are, is the future punishment of the
unchaste; and signifies not death or the grave; but hell and torment. See the
like expressions, Ezekiel. 32. 18, 19. etc. 28. 10. -31. 18. Prove. 7. 26, 27.
Esai. 10. 18. Psalm. 63. 9, 10.

same God never changing his counsels, the same Son of God Patron of the
Church; the same Spirit illuminating and sanctifying it; the same Covenant of
Grace; the same Gospel; the same benefits; by looking forward (as of old) upon
the seed promised; or looking backward (as in these latter times,) upon the
promise fulfilled. And as Heb. 8. 8. shows that the Gospel was a Covenant of
the latter days, in respect of Christ exhibited; so Gal. 3. 16, 17. shows it
was of the former, in respect of Christ promised. And those places where we
read of new and better Covenants, Heb. 8. 9, 10. better promises, Heb. 8. 6.
better Hope, Heb. 7. 19. etc. are not so to be understood; as if there were now
produced and made known some way of salvation to the world, when as there was
none before; or some new way of salvation, when as there was another before;
But are opposed, either not to the former times in general; i. e. in respect of
all persons, and of all Covenants made with, and promises made to, them: but
only to those times, in respect of the covenant of works; which then by the
error of many of the Jews (the children of works) was generally more looked
after, then the Covenant of faith, which had then but few followers: see Romans
9. 31, 32. when also the one Covenant was more largely and legibly drawn in
great Characters; the other put forth more obscure, and in a lesser Print, and
a veil drawn over it, 2 Cor. 3. 14. till the fullness of time was come.
Therefore also the former times had the denomination of the times of the law;
the latter of the Gospel. And again, in respect of the literal promise (under
the law) of felicity in the earthly Canaan. Therefore where the Apostle says [
established on better promises] understand there those typical ones, of earthly
Canaan, made to Israel at the promulgation of the law. Or opposed to those
times in general: but this only; first, in respect of the diverse
administrations of the former times with many troublesome ceremonials and types
to be afterward abolished: and of the degrees of the greater manifestations, in
the latter times, of the way of salvation; being void of shadows, types, and
figures: all these now being brought to perfection and accomplishment in the
incarnation of the Son; effusions of the Spirit; enlargement of the Church;
promulgation of an Heavenly country instead of an Earthly Canaan; and from
these greater manifestations many more of the children of works becoming now
the children of faith: And from its stronger beams as well those illuminated,
who before sat in darkness, Luke 1. 79. and midnight; as this light increased
to those, who had before some dawnings thereof. And secondly, in respect of the
accomplishment of those promises to the faithful of the former ages: which are
made through Christ, spoken of Heb. 11. 13, 14, 16. In which they could not be
completed and perfected before the times of the Gospel: neither in respect of
the body, they waiting for the restorement of that, till those of the Gospel
are glorified with them; nor (according to the reverend opinion of Antiquity)
in respect of the soul, they not having the kingdom of heaven laid fully opened
unto them till our Savior was first entered in thither. See Ephesians. 1. 10. Col. 1.
20. Heb. 11. 39, 40. -12. 23. For indeed the performance and perfection of the
mystery of man's redemtion was a thing only received in the last days. And tho
the virtue of Christ's incarnation is communicated always to all men; yet not
the latter times on the former, but the former depend on the latter, for the
substance and ground of their hope and salvation, Jesus Christ come in the
flesh. These having the body, of which body coming toward them the other had
the shadow; Col. 2. 17. And in these respects the times of the Gospel are said
to have so much advantage of those of the law: we seeing in a clear glass Gods
glory, they through a thick veil; we 2 Cor. 3. 13. standing in a clear, whereas
the best of them in a dim, light; and the most of them in utter darkness. See
Matt. 13. 17. -11. 11. 1 Cor. 2. 10. etc. 2 Cor. 3. 7. etc. Here note that the
oppositions of the times that are used in the other heads preceding (in which I
follow only the phrase of the Holy Scriptures) are by these limitations so to
be interpreted, as that they no way contradict the doctrine of this last
chapter.
