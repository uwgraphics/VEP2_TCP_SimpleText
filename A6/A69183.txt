A warning for all desperate Women.
By the example of Alice Dauis who for killing of her husband was burned in
Smithfield the 12 of July 1628. to the terror of all the beholders. To the tune
of the Ladies fall.


Unto the world to make my moan,
I know it is a folly,
Because that I have spent my time,
which have been free and jolly,
But to the Lord which rules above,
I do for mercy cry,
To grant me pardon for the crime,
for which on earth I dye.
Hells fiery flames prepared are,
for these that live in sin,
And now on earth I taste of some,
but as a prick or pin,
To those which shall hereafter be,
without Gods mercy great,
Who once more calls us to account,
on his Tribunal Seat.
Then hasty hairebraind wines take heed,
of me a warning take,
Least like to me in cool of blood,
you burned be at a stake;
The woman which here last did dye,
and was consumed with fire,
Puts me in mind, but all to late,
for death I do require.
But to the story now I come,
which to you I Will relate,
Because that I have liu^d like some,
in good repute and state,
In Westminster we lived there,
well known by many friends,
Which little thought that each of us,
should have come to such ends.
A Smith my husband was by trade,
as many well do know,
And diverse merry days we had,
not feeling cause of woe,
Abroad together we had bin,
and home at length we came,
But then I did that fatal deed,
which brings me to this shame.
He asked what moneys I had left,
and some he needs would have,
But I a penny would not give,
though he did seem to crave,
But words betwixt us then did pass,
as words to harsh I gave,
And as the Devil would as then,
I did both swear and rave,
The second Part, To the same tune.


ANd then I took a little knife,
and stabbed him in the heart.
Whose Soul from Body instantly,
my bloody hand did part,
But cursed hand, and fatal knife
and wicked was that hour,
When as my God did give me ore
unto his hellish power.
The deed no sooner I had don,
But out of doors I ran,
And to the neighbors I did cry,
I killed had my goodman,
Who straightway flockt unto my house,
to see that bloody sight,
Which when they did behold with grief,
it did them much affright.
Then hands upon me there was l^y'd,
And I to Prison sent,
Where as I lay perplexed in woe,
and did that deed repent,
When Sizes came I was arraigned,
by Jury just and true,
I was found guilty of the fact,
for which I have my due.
The Jury having cast me then,
to judgment then I came,
Which was a terror to my heart,
and to my friends a shame,
To think upon my husbands death,
and of my wretched life,
Betwixt my Spirit and my flesh,
did cause a cruel strife.
But then the Judge me sentence gave
to go from whence I came*
From thence unto a stake be bound
to burn in fires fl^me,
Until my flesh and bones consumed,
to ashes in that place,
Which was a heavy sentence then,
to on so uoyd of grace.
And on the twelfth of July now,
I on a sledge was laid,
To Smithfield with a guard of men
I straight way was conveyed,
Where I was tied to a stake,
with Reeds was round beset,
And Fagtos, Pitch, and other things
which they for me did get.
Now great Jehovah I thee pray,
my bloody sins forgive,
For on this earth most wretched I
unworthy am to live.
Christ Jesus unto thee I pray,
and unto t^ee I cry,
Thou with thy blood wilt wash my sins
away, which here must dye.
Good wives and bad, example take,
at this my cursed fall,
And Maidens that shall husbands have,
I warning am to all:
Your Husbands are your Lords and heads,
you ought them to obey,
Grant love betwixt each man and wife,
unto the Lord I pray.
God and the world forgive my sins,
which are so (...) and foul,
Sweet Jesus now I come to thee,
O Lord receive my Soul.
Then to the Reeds they fire did put,
which flamd up to the sky,
And then she shrieked most pitifully,
before that she did dye.
The Lord preserve our King and Queen,
and all good Subjects bless,
And Grant the Gospe^l true and free,
amongst us may increase.
Betwixt each husband and each wife,
send love and amity,
And grant that I may be the last.
that such a death did dye.
^INIS.
