Thou promiseste / that so many as hate Psalm. 129.

Thou promises^e / that thou will deliver Ezec. 34.

will feed them in most pleasant and sweet / pastures: ah good God / how
comes it tha^ to pass / that where as before thy sheep were f^dde with the

Thy most dear son / both promised and prophesied / that every plant /
which thou the heavenly father haste not planted / ^hal be plucked up by the

come to pass in the realm of England. For such plants / as the devil and
his chaplens had planted / were through the diligence and godly zele of thy
servants king Henry the eyghte / and king Edward the syxte / most blessedly
plucked up / and thy holy ordinances again planted unto the great joy and
unspeakable conforte of all the faithful. But now / through the tyranny and
blind zele of certain / are thy blessed statutes plucked up by the roots /
and set in again / are the damnable decrees / and crocked constitucions of
Antichriste / unto the exceeding great grief / sorrow and pensiveness of all
faithful Christians. Ah Lord God / seem these things matters of s^al
importans / before the eyes of thy diu^ne majesty? Can these outrageous
things be done in earth / and thou wincke at them in heaven? Art not thou he
/ that keeps Israel? Psalm. 121. Esa. 59.
But he neither sleapeth nor slombreth / says the Psalmographe / that keeps
Israel. Arise therefore / o Lord / why sleapest thou? Is thy ear so stopped /
that thou canste no more hear? And is thy hand so shortened / that it can
no more healpe? O Lord / arise for thy mercies sake / and help us. Haste the to
deliver us for thy name sake / for great are our troubles / and intolerable
are our miseries. Ah Lord / vouchesafe once again to look dounefro^ heaven /
and consider the lamentable state of the realm off England / and of the godly
inhabitau^tes thereof / which desire nothing so greatly / as to se thy true
honor perfectly setforth / thy holy word truly preached / the Christen
religion hyghly aua^nced / and thy holy name sanctified / praised / magnified
and commended for ever.

Ah Lord God / heretofore in the time of King Henry the ^yght^.
thy blessinge / thou gave to the realm off England a man to reygne over it
/ under whom the church was purged of many enormities and great abuses / and
the true religion began to have good success. And wha^ it was thy godly
pleasure too call him from this vale of misery / unto thy heavenly kingdom /
thou gave unto us his son to be King Edward the sixte.
our King / a Prince / although young in years / and tender in age / yet
auncieut in the knowledge of the / of thy son Christ / and of thy holy word
/ and as another Josias / altogether bent utterly to wedeout al falls religion /
supersticio^ / hypocrisye / papistrie / etc. and after a most perfect manner /
to set up thy holy religion / and to auau^ce the har^y favorers of the same /
unto the great and wonderful example of all Christen princes. But alas for
sorrow / this most goodly and godly Impe / this most Christian king / this noble
yo^ge Josias was for our unthankfulness and wicked living taken away from us
/ before the time unto our great sorrow and unspeakable hearts disease. Whose
death was the beginning / and is now still the co^tinuau^ce of all our sorrows
/ griefs and miseries. For in the stead of that verteous prince / thou haste
set to rule over us an woman / whom nature has formed 1. Tim. 2.
to be in subieccio^ unto man / and who^ thou by thine holy Apostle co^maundest
to keep silence / and not to speak in the co^gregacio^. Ah Lord / to take away
the empire from a man / and to give it unto a woman / seems to be an evident
toke^ of thine a^ger toward us Englishmen. Esa. ^.
For by the Prophet^ / thou being displeased with thy people / threatnest to
set women to rule over the^ / as people unworthy to have lawful / natural and
mete governors to reign over the^. And verily though we find / that women
sometime bare rule among thy people / yet do we read / that such as ruled and
were queen's / were for the most part wicked / ungodly / supersticious / and
given to idolatry / and to al filthy abhominacio^ / as we may se in the
histories of queen Iesabel / 3. Reg. 19. 4. Reg. 11
queen Athalla / queen Herodias / and such like. Ah Lord God / we dare not
take upon us Math. 14
to judge any creature / for unto the alone are the secrets of all hearts
known / but of this are we sure / that since she ruled / whyther of her own

has prevailed / yea / and that under the color of the catholic church /
and the old ancient faith / when notwithstanding darkness is not more
contrary to light / nor cold unto heat / than their procedinges are contrary
to the truth of thy holy word if the practice and doctrine of the true
catholic church / (we speak of the Patriarchs and Prophets / of Christ
and his Apostles / and of so many godly people / as lived from Adam unto the
time that Antichrist / the bishop of Rome set up his kingdom 2 These. 2.
/ and auau^ced him self above all that is called God) might be the judge / and
go for payment. For besides the geuinge of the kingdom / unto the rule of a
woman / O Lord / we mos^e humbly beseech the / to consider that outrageous
floudes of most grievous enormities / have braste in and ouerflowed the realm
of England / unto the utter subversion of the same / except thy merciful goodness
do the shortly help.

Ah Lord God / heretofore under the rule Psalm. 50 Romans 10.
of that most Christen king Edward the ^yxte / we were ^aught according to
thy word to fle with our prayers unto the alone / in all our troubles and
necessities / as a Lord ple^tefully rich for so many as call on the. God
alone is to be called on.
But now the Antichristiane Preachers teach / that we must also pray to
creatures that are dead / that they may pray for us / or else we pray unto the
invayne / and our prayers shall never be heard.

Heretofore we were taught / that Christ 1. Tim. 2. 1. Joan. 8. Roma. 2.
Christalene is our mediator, advocate and intercessour
God and man is our alone mediatoure / advocate and intercessore. But now the
priests of Baal teach / that Mary / James Peter / Ihon / Paul / Andrew / and
we know not who / are also our mediators / advocates and Intercessoures / and
that we must call upon them in our troubles and adversities / when soever we
will have to do with the / namely if we will have our matter go forward.

Heretofore we were taught / that the 1. Joan. 1. Apoc. 1. Christ's blood is
the alo^e Purgatory off the faithful.
precious blood of our savior Christ is the alone and sufficient Purgatory
for the sins of all them that repent and believe. But now the papists teach
/ that there is a purging place after this life / where the souls of the
faithful shall be mise^ably tormented with fyrye f^ames / till either they them
selfs have made satis^accion for all their sins / by suffering dew
punishment or else other in this world have made ame^des for them / by prayeng /
by synging of tre^ talles / by going on ^ylgrimage / by dealeng monye / by
^yenge the pepes pardons for their redemption / and such like / when the holy
scripture contrariwise teaches / that Sap. 3. Apoc. 14
the faithful so sone as they depart from this life / go streyghtwayes unto
glory / ^he unfaithful unto everlasting pain and damnacion / as we may se
in the history of the rich glotton / and of the poor man Lazarus. Luc. 16


Heretofore we were taught / that Christ Christis one and alone sacrifice
sufficith forever and ever. Esa. 53. Heb. 7. 9. 10. 1. Pet. 2. Apoc. 1.
thy son and our alone Savior / made upon the aultare of the cross / when
he suffered and dyed for us / so sufficient / perfect / absolute and consummate
oblacion / and sacrifice for the sins of the people / that by that one / and
alone sacrifice / grace / favor / mercy / forgeuenes of sins and
everlasting life / is for ever and ever plentefully obtained of the / for so
many as repent and believe. But now a days / those Baali^e massemongers are not
ashamed to reprove that sweet smelling sacrifice of Christ / and too say /
that it is not so perfect / but that they also must offer Christ up again
daily in their masses for the sins of the people / and that their oblacion is
a propiciatory sacrifice / and of no les virtue / strength / efficaci^ might
and power / than the pashon and death of Christ / than the sacrifice / which
Christ him self offered on the altar of the cross. Our missale sacrifice /
say the massing papists / is propiciatory / satisfactory / expiatory / and
necessary. Ad salutem, both for the quick and for the dead. The people syn
daily / therefore must we offer sacrifice for the sins of the people daily in
our masses. O Antichrists.
What other thing is this / o heavenly father / tha^ to defye the death of thy
son / to despise his most healthful sacrifice / to set at naught his
wholesome oblacion / too tread underfoot the blood of the everlasting Heb. 10.
Testament / and utterly too deface both the kingdom and priesthode of Christ
/ and to erecte / and set up a new kingdom and priesthode of their own / a
new sacrifice / and a strange oblacion / inverted of the deuel / brought in
by Antichriste / confyrmed Apoc. 13. Apoc. 21.
by such as have received the beasts mark / and frequented / used and
sought of all / that have their portion in that lake that burns with fire
and brymstone / except they repent and amend? Is not Christ an everlasting
priest? Psalm. 110. Heb. 7. Heb. 10
Does not his priesthood continue from generation to generation? Has he not
with one oblacio^ made per^ecte for ever / them that are sanc^ifi^? Are we not
made holy by the offering up of the body of Jesus done once for all? (...) not
Christ / after he had offered one sacrifice for sins / sit him down for ever
/ on the right hand of God / and from hen^forth tarieth till his foos be made
his footestoole? Is not Jesus Christ yesterday and to day / and the same
continues forever? Heb. 13.
What have we than to do with the sa^rificing massemo^ ^ers or with their
missal sacrifice? O heavenly father / suffer us not to be carried about with
diverse and strange learning.

Moreover / heretofore we were caughte Aultar^ no^ ^ollerable among Christians.
to beat down the Idolatrous and Heathenish altars / which Antichrist of Rome
ente^ding to set up a new priesthood and a strange sacrifice forsynne /
commanded to be buylte up / as though calfes / goats / sheep and such other
brute beasts should be offered again after the priesthood of Aaron / for the
sins of the people / and to set in their stead Christ, his Apostles and the
prima^iue church used tables at the ministracion off the holy communion.
in some convenient place a semely table / and after the examples of Christ /
to receive together at it the holy mysteries of Christian body and blood / in
remembrance that Christ's body was broken / and his blood shead for our
sins. But now the sacrificinge sorcerer^ shame not both in their private
talk / and in their open sermons spitely to call the Lords table an
Oysterborde / and therefore have they taken out of the temples those semely
tables / which we following the examples of thy derely beloved son / and of
the primative church used at the ministracion of the holy communion / and they
have brought in again their bloody and bocherly altars / and upon those O
cruel bu^chers.
they sacrifice and offer daily / say they / that is / they kyl / slay and
murderthy dear son Christ for the si^nes of the people. For as thy holy
apostle says: Heb. 9
Where no shedding of blood is / there is no remission and forgeuenes of
sins. If through their massing sins be forgeuen / tha^ must the sacrifice
that there is offered be s^ayn / and the blood thereof shead. If the
massemo^gers therefore offer Christ up in their masses / a sacrifice unto God
for O murth^rers.
the sins of the people / so follows it that they murder / kyl / and ^lea
Christ / yea / and shed his blood at their masses / and so by this mea^s we
must needs confess / that bloody altars are more mete for such bloody bochers
/ tha^ honest and pure tables. Romans 6
But we are taught in the holy schriptures / that Christ once raised from
death / dies no more. Death has no more power over him. For as touchi^g that
he dyed / he died co^cerni^g sin once. And as touching that he lives / he
lives unto the god his father. If Christ therefore dies no more / tha^ do the
papists sacrifice him no more. Idolatrous
If they sacrifice him no more than are they ^ut iangling iuglars / and their
masses serve for none other purpose / but to keep the people i^ blyndnes / to
deface the pas^on and death of Christ / and to maintain their idle and
drafsacked bellies / in all pomp and honor / with the labor of ^ther men's
hands / and with the sweat off poor men's brows / so far is it of that /
they with their abominable massing and stinking sacrificing / put away the
sins either of the quick or of the dead / as they make the unlearned and
simple people to believe. Masses why they serve.
Ah Lord God and heavenly father / if thou were not a God of long sufferinge
and of great patience / how couldeste thou abyd these intolerable injuries /
and to much detestable blasphemies / which the wicked papists commit
against the and thy son Christ / in their idolatrous masses / at their
Heatheni^h aultares?

Heretofore we were taught to receive the misreries of the Lords body and
blood together / according too the ordinance of Christ. The faithefull
ought too receive the Sacrament together, and not the priest alo^e.
But now no communion is had / For the popish and uncharitable massemo^ger /
utterly abusinge the Lords soupper / eats and drincketh vp^ all alone at his
idolatrous aultare.

Heretofore we were taught to receive the Sacrament of the body and blood of
Christ under both kinds / according unto Christ's institucion / which says:
Drink of this al ye. The faitheful onght to receive the Sacrament under both
^yndes.
And as the holy apostle says: So often as ye shall eat of this bread / and
drink of this cup / ye shall remember the Lords death till he come. Math.
26 1. Cor. 11. Joan. 15.
But now the Romish sorcerers / contrary to the ordinance and commandment of
thy son / the master of truth / yea / the^self truth / and contrary to the
practice and usage of the primative church / like thieves / robbers and
murderers / cruelly take away from thy people the mystical cup of Christ's
blood / for the mayntenaunce of their deuelish decre / and minister after
their sort the Sacrament of thankesgeuinge to thy Christians only under one
kind / yea / and that without the preaching of the Lords death / repentance
/ faith / amendment of life / etc. and so make they it an idle and dumme
ceremony altogether vuprofitable and without fruit / which being rightely
ministered / is to the faithful a Sacrament of great joy and conforte.

Heretofore we were taught / that the Lords soupper / or breaking of the
bread / as The Lords supper is a memorial of Christ's death.
the Apostles term it / is a memorial of the body breaking and blood sheading
of our sauiou^ Christ / and that as we outwardly feed of the bread and wine /
so we inwardly through faith feed of the blessed body and precious blood of
Jesus Christ our Lord / unto the great and unspeakable conforte both of soul
and body. But now the disciples of Antichrist knowing that the whole glory of
their kingdom lygheth in the sals opinion and abuse of this Sacrament / in all
their sermons and private talk / labor / swyncke / sweat and seek all means
possible with tothe and nail / with hand and foot / with tunge and pe^ne /
with fire and faggot / with sword and halter to persuade the people / that
after they have whyspered a few Latin words / with one breath over the bread
and wine / and have blessed / crossed / coniured and handled them after their
ghostely manner / there remains no more breadde and wine / although we
bothese / feel / and taste very bread and very wine / yea / and although the
holy scripture / after the words of consecracio^ / called the Sacrament /
bread and wine / but say they / the bread through the virtue of the words /
which we holy anointed rehearse / is turned into the natural substance of
Christ's body / and the wine is changed into the natural blood O ^uglers.
of Christ / only the accident^s of breadde and wine remayninge / when
notwithstanding the holy scriptures teach us in diverse places / that thy Christ
is ascended into heaven / and sytteth on thy right hand / and there shall
remain / concer^ing his humanite / till he come too judge the quick and the
dead. Marc. 16. Luc. 24 Act. 1. Romans 8. Ephe. 4. Colos. 3. Philip. 3. Heb. 10.
And after these Capernaites have ^^bored to persuade the people / that the
Sacramental bread is the very true / natural / corporal / substanciall /
real / and sensible body of Christ / even the selfsame that was borne of
Mary the virgin / lived upon the earth / was hanged upon the cross / and
dyed for us / than exhort they the people with all reverence and humilite to
knowledge and believe it too be their Lord God / their maker and redemer /
their Savior and defender / and so too fall down before it to honor and
worship it / to praise and call upon it / to fle unto it for soccoure / and
to look for all good things of it / as of the very true and everlasting God.
O abhom^ nation.
By these means (o heavenly father) they bring away thy people through they^
vain / fleshly and sophistical reasons / from the honoringe of the thalone
true / Imortal / muisible and everlasting God / unto the worshippig of a piece
of b^cad / yea / of a very idol / where as thou alone ought to have all the
honor and glory. 1. Timo. 1 Psalm. 98.
O Lord arise / and let thine enemies be scattered / let the^ also that hate
the / flee before the / like a^ the smok vanishes / so driu^ thou them away /
and like as wax melts at the fire / so let the vugodly papis^es perish and
be confounded that thy people be no le^ger seduced / and led from the way of
truth / by their subtle and carnal imaginacions / but that they being
truly taught / may know the too be the alone true God / and whom thou have
sent Jesus Christ. Joan. 17.


Heretofore we had in the temples when we came together to pray and to give
thanks unto the / all our prayers and thankee giving in the tu^ge that we
v^derstode / whereby we received great comfort / and were much edified. Common
^raier ought to be in that ^^ge that all the people understand.
But now the papists (which with thy people to be more rude tha^ asses / more
biynde than be^les / more ignorant than dastardes / that they might make them
there ryding fools and lauggyng stocks) contrary too the usage and practice
of the primative Church / yea / contrary to thy commandment given by thine
Apostle / which wills all things in the congregation too be uttered in such
a speech as all might understand and be edified / or else silence to be kept /
have brought the matter to this po^t / that all English service driven out of
the Churches / they have stablished their popish 1. Cor. 4.
latin service / which the most part of thy people understand nothing at
all. O (...).
And yet so cruel and malicious are the papists / that they enforce and with
violence compel thy people to come unto their Romish / super^^icious /
blasphemous / and idolatrous Latin service / to hear it / to reverence and
honor it with their presence / and too call it Gods service / when they
understand no^ / whither Baals priests that there bleate and mu^ble / do
bless or curse / praise or blaspheme. Most certain is this / that thy people

again / as unlearned and ignoraunte / as they came thither.

Heretofore we had read in our temples every sunday / and at diverse other
times a godly and learned homely or sermon / and certain chapters out of the
holy Bible in the English tunge / that all the people might understand what
was done or said / which gave them occasion to forsake ^ice / and to embrace
virtue / to live in thy fair / and diligently to call upon thy blessed name.
Homilies in English and chapter^ of the Bible
But now both those godly homiles and confortable chapters have thine enemies
the papists ba^nished out of the temples unto the great discomfort of al such
as unfeignedly ^oue the / and thy blessed word / and in the stead of the^ /
they have set up blasphe mous collacio^s / synging / rynging / pyping /
sensynge / holy water castinge / holy bread ^ealing / palms and candles
bearing / cross kneling / bread worshipping / as^hes ^odding fire and rapers
halowing / with an infinite number of such like Heathen ceremonies / that the
people being occupied with such chyldishe trifles / lousye tradicious and
beggarly Popis^ bag^ag^.
ceremonies / might forget the wholesome food of their souls / which is thy
holy and blessed word. Math. 4.


Heretofore / upon the Sondayes and certain other days in the weke / we had
the Letanye rehearsed among us in our Engly^hetu^g / every one of us kneling
devoutly and (...) calling on the for mercy and grace. The Letan^^ ^n
Englissh^.
O heavenly father / this was setforth in the time of thy servant king Henry
the eygh^e / and continued among us / until the death of that most godly and
verteous prince ^ynge Edward the syxte / and a littel after unto the syngulare
^o^e and great conforte of all godly and Christen hearted people. But now the
subtle and fleshely pap^stes have so bewyiched the Queen's eyes / that
whatsoever her father and her brother / most godly brought too pass for the
a^auncement of thy glory / and for the edifyeng of thy people / that is utterly
subverted and taken for heresye / yea / and spitefullye preached against in
open sermons / so that this godly and most wholesome Letanye is not only
taken away from us / but in the stead thereof we are compelled to go on
precession / following an Idol / with synginge Ora pro nobis, Salve festa
dies, or some other ^lasp^emous song unto the great sorrow and inward heart
/ breakinge of all thy faithful.

Heretofore / thy Sacraments were so ministered unto us / that we received
great conforte by them. Sacrament^ trulystred.
But now they are so ministered of this swyny^he spiritual forcerers / that
they are become dumme and idle ceremonies altogether without edyfyeng or
profyt. For besides that they are ministered in an vnknowentunge / how be they
defiled with men's tradicio^^ / and beggarly ceremonies? unto the Sacrament of
Baptism / they put Heatenish rites and wicked coniuracions. The Sacrament of
Baptism.
For Baals priest / before the child can be baptized / bewytcheth the water
/ shuts the church door / coniureth the deuel out of the poor you^ge
Infaunt / bespueth the child with his vile spitle and stinking slaueringe /
puts salt in the^ chyldes mouth / smereth it with greasye and ^^sauer oil /
etc. And without these apy^h toys / they make the people believe / that the
baptism is nothing worth. Ah good is this any other thing than a play^e
laughing to scorn of thy dear sons institution? Do these papists / by
adding their beggarly ceremonies any other thing / than set thy son Christ
to schole / and auaunce their own fle^hly imaginacio^s above the wisdom of
the Lord Christ?

The Sacrament also of thy dear sons body and blood / how have the
adversaries prophanated and defiled? The Sacrament of Christ's bodij and b^^^de.
thy son both before and after the ministracion of the Sacrament preached
unto his disciples. The papists preach nothing at all. Thy son spoke the
words of the institucion openly in that tunge / that all the disciples
understood. The papists utter all things in a strange language / yea / and
that so softely that they scace hear the^ selfs. A comparion between Christ
and the papists, in the ministracion of the Sacrament.
Thy son ministered the Sacraments without putting on of any disguysed
apparel. The papists deck them selfs like hycke scorner in game players
garments. Thy son ministered the Sacrament / sitting at the table with his
disciples. The papists stand at the aultare / and give the bread and wine to
the people kneling. Thy son gave the Sacrame^tal bread to the disciples in
their hands / saying: Take / eat. The papists thrust the bread into the
people mouths / as though they had not so much wit as to feed them selfs.
Thy son ministered the Sacrament of his body and blood under both kinds to
his disciples. The papists do minister it to the lay people only under one
kind / and like thieves steal the other away^ from them / and reserve it to
themselfes alone. Thy son brake the Sacramental bread. The papists use no
breakinge of the bread / as Christ and his Apostles and all the primative
church did for to declare the mis^erie of Christ's body / breakinge on the
aultare of the cross for our redemption / but they put into the peoples
mouths a littell light whyghte waffer cake / speaking to them a few words
in Latin / which they understand not. Thy son did appointe the Sacrame^tall
bread to be broken and eaten. The papists keep it whole / and hang it up in
the pyxe / yea / and carrye it about for a pageaunte in their idolatrous /
popish / pompous processions. Thy son instituted the Sacrament to be a
memortall of his body breakinge and blood shedding. The papists teach /
that the bread and wine is turned into the natural body and blood of Christ
God and manne / even the selfsame body that was borne of Marye the vyrgine /
flesh / blood / and bone / so that there remayueth neither bread nor wine /
although the holy scripture affyrmeth plainly / that this is both bread Bread
and wine remain in the Sacraments after the words off consecracio^
and wine remaining / the doctors of the Christen primative church testefyed
the same in their writtinges / the Greek church / eue^ from the Apostles time
unto this day have so received and believed / utterly deuieng the popish
art^kle of tra^ssubsta^tiaci^ / reason also and all the senses of man testefye
that there remain both bread and wine / after the words of consecracion / as
they use to term them / yea / and experience teaches / that if the
Sacramental breadde be long reserved / it will corrupt / putrify moulde /
styncke / and bredefull of worms / and the wine likewise / will change the
colloure and wax sour. Tra^ssubstantiacion.
O heavenly father / such corrupcion can not chance too thy d^^e sons body
and blood / which is incorruptible and ^mortal / sits on thy righthand / and
raygneth with the in glory for ever and ever. This Antichristian doctrine / o
blessed Lord / was not known in thy holy Church / v^tyll pope Nicholas /
pope Innocent / pope Vrbane / Friar Thomas / and such other ministers of
Satan / partly with their tyranny / and partelye with their sophistrye / as
their apysshe adherentes do now again in this our days / brought it in /
and compelled the Christians with fire and swearde / to believe this their
monstrous opinion / for the mayntenau^ce of their bellye kingdom / although it
be never so much contrary too the artikles of our faith / and too the
doctrine of the holy scripture / and of all the aunciente writters. Thy son
at his supper / willed the Sacramental bread and wine too be eaten and
droncken for a remembrance off that one / and alone sacrifice / which he
offered on the altar of the cross / for the sins of the people. The
papists in their ido latrous and abominable masses make of the Sacrament a
propiciatorie / expiatory and satisfactory sacrifice for the sins off the
people / necessary Ad salute^, affirming that their act in the mass is of
equal price / dignity / virtue / might / efficacy and power before the eyes
of thy divine majesty with the most healthful and sweet smellyng sacrifice /
that thy son offered on the altar of the cross / wha^ he gave hi^ self unto
the death for the sins of the people. O intolle^ble blasphemy.
Thy son ordained the Sacrament too be a sign and token of ^ou^ / wha^ the
godly come together to eat all of one bread^ and to drink^ all of one cup.
The papists make it (...) Sacrament of dissencion / discord and debate. For
if any will not agree too their fles^helye / wicked and dettely^ ^he ^pynyon /
confessing their error off transsubstantiatio^ / and affyrming^ that the
bread and wine is the very natural body and blood of Christ God and man /
and therefore ought too be ^neled unto / worshipped / honored / and called
upon as the only true / living and immortal God / they fall out with them
/ they call them heretykes / they persecute them / they apprehende them / they
empresonne and burn them without mercy? And as the wicked papists prophanate
and vnhallowe these two aforesaid holy Sacraments / so do they like filthy
swyne defyle all other mysteries / that thy son Chris^e has ordained with
reverence to be used in thy church.

An Lord God and our heavenly father / therefore we were taught too wor^hip
the in spirit and truethe / and too pray unto the every where / lyftinge up
pure hands without wrath or doubtinge. Joan. 4. 1. Tim. 2.
But now the papists teach us to pray unto the and unto all the company of
heaven with boynge and bleatinge in the quyre / with playeng on the organs /
with saying ladies psalters on beads / with mumblynge over certain prayers /
in the tunge that we understand not. Pra^^r.


Heretofore we were taught / that thou alone forgeuest us all our sins /
when souer we earnestly repent / and vnfay^edly turn unto the, God alone
forgeueth sin.
But now the papists teach / that they also have power too forgive sins /
and that our sins can not be forgeuen / except we confess them unto the
priest with all circumstaunces. Esa. 43. Marc. 2. Luc. 5.


Heretofore we were taught to look for all salvation of the through faith in
the blood of Christ. Faith only iustefied.
But now the papists teach us to look for salvation in our own good works
/ in the intercession of saints / in prayers and merits of synneful
hypocrites and beastly belligoddes / in ceremonies / in will works / in
tradicious of men / in holy bread / holy water / holy candels / holy palms /
holy as^hes / latin service / idolatrous masses / supersticious Diriges /
trifelinge trentalles / popish fastinges / belles / beads / etc. Abominacions.


Heretofore we were taught to cast out of our temples the Idols and Mawmettes
wherewith many com^itted spiritual whordome and ra^ne an whoring / and to
garnish the church with the holy scriptures / that the people might learn to
know and to fear the. Images not tolerable in the temples of the Christians.
But now the ungodly papists have brought the matter to this point / that
the sentences of thy blessed law are blotted / and utterly wyped out of the
temples / and Idols are there placed manifestlye and directly / against thy
blessed commandment / which thy enemies call lay men's Cale^ders Exodus 20
Leuit. 19. Deuteronomy. 5. 7. 12.
or books / as though o Lord God / the people might sooner be brought unto the
knowledge of the / by looking on deformed stock^s and stones / than by reading
thy holy and blessed word. Joan. 5
Thy son and our savior Christ commands us to search the scriptures /
and not to behold Idols and Mawmettes. Joan. 8.
He that is of god / says he / hearethe the word of god. He sayethe not / he
that is of god ru^eth unto Images / and sees what goodness he ca^ne pycke out

He says not my sheep has a delyghte and pleasure too behold vain Idols
and mahounde like Mawmettes. Psalm. 119.
Thy servant David calls them blessed / that search thy testimonies and
have a pleasure too study in thy law day and night. Psalm. 1.
For thy holy word is only the book / wherein thy people ought to look / and
not dumme Images and carved Idolles / which are cursed of the in thy holy law /
yea and the makers of them also. Deuteronomy. 27
Ah Lord God / they that have this procured / that thy holy word should be
wyped and blotted out of the churches / is it not to be thought / that their
names are blotted and wyped^ out of the ^oke of life also^ Yea / is it not too
be thought that such Antichrists would gladly have both the / and thy holy

that is of God / hears the word of God. Joan. 8. Joan. 10.
Ye therefore hear it not / because ye are not of God. Again / ye believe not /
because ye are not of my sheep. Iere. 3.
Ah Lord these children of Bel^all have forsaken the thalone fountain of

dyrtie puddels / that are able too hold no water. They are such people / as
continually provoke the unto anger. Esa. 30.
They are lye^g children / yea / such children / as will not hear the law of
God. They say to the preachers / look out of the scriptures no good lesso^s
for us. And to the godly learned they say / tell not us those things that are
right / neither rebuke our wickedness and Idolatry / but speak unto us
pleasant things / and such as we delight too hear. Tell not us of gods a^ger
/ justice and judgment against the stifnecked idolators / but preach unto us

under one kind / contrary to Christ's institucion / auriculare confession /
etc. Tread out of the way / go out of the pathe / away with the holy one of
Israel from us. We are weary of him. It greueth us to remember him. We can
neither abide his word truly preached / nor yet his laws written in our
churches. Out with the scriptures / and in with the Idols and Mawmettes. Psalm.
79.
O Lord God / are not these the Heathen / that have braste into thine heritage
/ that have defiled thy holy temple / and made Jerusalem an heap of stones?
have mercy on us / o Lord / have mercy on us.

Heretofore, The confirmation of children.
we were taught so to bring up our children in the principles of Christen
religion / that when they should come to be confirmed of the bis^hop / they
might be able to say the articles of the faith / the Lords prayer / and the
ten commandments / and to answer to such questions / as are contained in
that short Catechism / which was appointed to be learned of every child /
before he were brought to be co^fyrmed. But now the papists say to such as
are witnesses of the chyldes baptism: Ye are bound by the order of our mother
the holy church to se / that this child be co^fyrmed so sone as is possible /
or as soon as ye hear that the bishop comes within seven miles of this town
/ without any further delay. Of the things contained in the godly Catechism /
for the right institucio^ of the child / they make no mention. And what is
the confyrmacion of the children / that is used at this present / but plain
sorce rye / deuelerye / wytchcrafte / iuglinge / legerdemain / and all that
naught is? The Bishop mumbleth a few latin words over the child / charmeth
him / crosses him / smeareth him with stinckinge popish oil / and tyeth a
lynnen bond about the chyldes neck / and sends him home. O Lord God / what
a confirmacion of the chyldes faith is this? Yea / rather what a delusion ann
mocking is this of the godly ancient custom / in confirming children?

Heretofore / we were taught too bring up our children in the knowledge of
the and thy son Christ / that even from the very cradles they might be
enstructed in thy holy mysteries / and learn to fear the / to believe The
Ca^echisme both in Latin and in English.
in the / to love the / to pray unto the / to be thanckfull unto the / and to
frame their whole lyffe according to thy blessed law^ / that they might serve
the their lord god in holiness and ryghteousnes all the days of their life.
And for this purpose had we setforthe a godly and learned catechism both in
latin and in Englysse / wherein owr long ones were most virtuously brought up
unto the great joy of their parents / the singular confort of al godly
Christianes / and the wonderful increase both of thy glory and of all godlynes
and virtue. But now the wicked Papists / wyche always deal extremly with the
ryghteous and take away their labors Sap. 5.
/ have condemned that Christen Chatechisme as heresye / and have procured
certayu Catechism condemned for heresi. Articles from the Queen
Antichristiane articles from the Queen / wherein among to many other / a
straight commandment is geten / that children should so be brought up / that
they might learn to healpe the Priest say mass wych mass is the very
fonntayne and head spring off all i^dolatrye and spiritual whordome. Ah
lord God / shy servannts both in the old and new testament brought up
their children far other wise / as the hestories Exe^ples of bringing up
children.
of Abraham / Isaac / Jacob / Daniel / Tobie / Mathathiae / the Parents of
Susanne and of Timothe / Philippe the Eua^geliste / and such other do declare
/ And thy holy co^ma^deme^t is not / that Pare^tes should bring up their
children in learning to healpe and Ilatrous Priest to say his abominable and
blasphemous mass / but to know the their lord God / to believe in the / to
fear and love the / to callvpo^ thy blessed name / to betha^ckefull unto the /
and to fasson their lyffe according to thy holy word and commandment.

Heyrtofor we were taught / that it is law Of the marage of Prii^tes.
full for every maue / be he Bishop / Priste / Deacon / Monk / Friar /
Chauon / Here mite / or any other / that have not the gift of continencye / to
take unto him a ffaythe full yoke fellow / and with her to marrye in thy fear
/ and to possese his own vessel 1 These. 4 1 Cor. 7. Heb. 13.
in holiness and honor / as thine holy apostle says / to avoid fornication
let every ma^haue his own wyffe / and every woman her own husbond. Again /
marriage is honorable among all mean and the bed vnde fyled. But whormongers
and adulterers God shall judge. But now the wicked Papists those lecherous
lubers / those fyl thy fornicatours / these abominable adulterers / those
srynckyng Sodemites / those Papists.
canckred corruptours of maids / wyffs / and wydowes / those debylyshe
despisers of all shamefastnes / chastity and honest / those monstrous
mai^tainers of all lice^tious living / whordome and deshoneste / C. 4. and and
those synnefull synckes of all fylthy and lothesome abhominacions have brought
the godly and lawefull marriage of ministers / and their wives unto this point
/ that it is now counte^d whordome. The faithful housbandes are taken for
whoremongers / and their honest wives for whores. The tira^nij of the cruel
papists, in deuorcinge priests and their vvijues.
Yea / unto such an heyghte is their furious madness and mad furye groune /
that they against all right and conscience / against all truth and honesty /
do not only most wickedly deuorce them / but they also cruelly compel diverse
of the ministers / which are faynteharted / and where / as it seems / but
tymelinges / serving rather the time (as the manner of the worldlinges is) than
maryeng in thy fear / to do open penance before the people / and to confess
(o the to much corrupt manners of this synnefull world) that their marriage
was no marriage / but plain whordome. Repent ye vvic^ed blasphmers of
honorable marriage, and tabelour vvijues again unto iou.
And there those filthy dogs / which are returned unto their vomit / most
wretchedly couche and knele down before the people / and desire them to
forgive them / and promise that they will neuermore come in their wyfes company
/ but from hensforth / live like good and catholic men / according to the
order of their holy priesthood / that is to say / abstain from honorable
wedlock / and defyle them selfs with all kind of whordome / uncleanness and
dishonestie. Leuit. 21. Eze. 44.
Ah Lord God / thou commaundest thy priests in the old law / not only too
marrye / but thou also appointest them / what wives they should marrye / which
thing thou would not have done / if the marryage of priests had been so
vile and detestable a thing in thy sight / as the wicked and fylthy papists
make it. In the new law also the men / whom thy well-beloved son did chose
in this vale of misery to be his disciples and apostles / to be the preachers
of his glorious Gospel / and the administratours of his holy Sacraments /
were not fleshely votaries / as the papists are / but honest and godly married
men / lyuinge with their wives / according to thy holy ordinance / ud
bringynge up their children in thy fear / and after the doctrine of thy
blessed word. Neither did the apostles put away their wives / after they were
called unto the ministry / as the lyenge papists for a color of their synful
life do most falshly feign / but they continued with their wives lovingly and
faythefully / till death departed them / as we may se in ancient histories /
and as it may easly be gathered of the manifest words of the holy scriptur.
Have not we power / says the apostle / to lead about a sister to wife / 1.
Cor. 9.
as well as other apostles / and as the brethren of the lord and Cephas? Either
only I and Barnabas have not pour this to do: Here is it evident / that
thapostles of Criste did not only not put away their wives after the were
called unto the ministerre / as the false Papists fable but they also led their
wyffes about with them / as theye went abroad? preaching the gospel of crist.
Eccl. hist. lib. 3. ca. 30.
Read we not that S. peter continued with his wife until her dyeng day / and
that when she was led unto the place of execution to suffer death for
co^fessyng Christ to be God / S. Peter her husbond followed her / exhorted her
to be strong in the faith of Christ / and said unto her: O wife / remember
the Lord? oh with whatforheade dursie Peter have exhorted men to dwell in
house together 1. Pet. 3.
with their wyffes according to their knoulege / if he contrary to his
knowledge had put away his wyffe^ With what face could thapostle. Philip. 4
s. Paul have made mention of his wyffe / calling her his faith full yoke
fellow / and desyryng her to healpe the women / which labored with hime in
the gospel / if he being unfaithful had put away his wyffe contrary to his
promise and the law of God? If thapostles had put away their wyffes after
they were called unto the ministry and preaching of how durst Paul have
been so bold / as 1. Cor. 9.
to wryghte unto the Corithians / that they led their wyffes about wihe
theme? Yea / if thapostles had put away their wyffes / how could they
have exhorted other men according to the law of God / to forsake father and
mother and to cleue unto Genesis 2. Mar. 19. Mat. 5.
their wyffes / and no man to forsake his wife for any cause except it before
fornication. This their for is but a shadow of the filthye Papists to blind
the eyes of the simple and ignora^te. Furthermore all the holy Bishops and
ministers of the primative church were married mean / or at the least were at
liberty to marrye / if they would.

Again / the Priests among the Greeks even from thappostles time unto this
day have ever been at liberty to marrye / neytheyr is their ministerye
theffror the les esteemed of the godly / which are persuaded by the word of
God / that wedlock is honorable Hebr. 13.
among all mean and the bed undefiled. The marriage of Priests was never for
bydden in any place. till Antichriste off Rome brought it to pass / partly
by the tira^ny of the seculare power / and partly by flatteryng words
grau^tyng Priests co^cubines and whoresin stead off their lawefull wyffes /
who^ for a^ yearly pe^sio^ they may at their pleasure etheyr keep still or put
away / and take anewe.

But o heavenly father / as thy faithful servant Paul prophesied long before
/ so is it come to pass. 1. Tim. 4
The spirit speaks evidently / says he / that in the latter days / some
shall depart from the faith / and shall give head unto spirits of error and
deue lish doctrine of them / which speak falls Paul's prophecy fulfilled.
through hypocrisye / and have their consciences marked with an h^te iron /
forbiddinge to marrye. This prophecye is fulfilled in that Antichriste of Rome
/ and in his whorish generation. For they alone forbid marryage / which thing
neither Jew / nor Turk nor any Iufidel besides does. Neither can the papists
thyfte of this prophecye / from them unto certain here^ykes / which utterly
condemned marryage. For the holy Apostle prophecieth of such as forbid
marryage / and not of them that utterly cast away and condemn marryage as a
thing altogether unclean and unmeet for a Christen man. They therefore that
forbid the marryage of priests are by the judgment of the most worthy
apostle / yea / of the holy Ghost / departed from the says / and give head
too the spirits of error and deuelish doctrine of them / which speak false
through hypocrisye / and have their conscience marked with an hot iron / be
they Popes / Cardinals / Bishops / Emperors / Kings / Queen's / Dukes or
any other. Swifte da^nacion bring all such upon themselfes / except they
shortly repent.

Heretofore / we had such shepehardes / Godlij Bisshops and faithful
preachers.
as were tender fosters of thy flock. They cheryshed and made much of thy
thepe. For such as were weak / they tenderly cherisshed / the syke they
healed / the broken they bound up together / the outcas^es and such as ran
astraye / they lovingly brought home again / the lost they diligently
sought / and res^ored them too the shepefolde. None of thy sheep did they
willingly suffer to perish. Even as a nurse among her children / so lived they
among thy people. Not with the sour leaven of the Phariseys / but with the
heavenly Manna of thy blessed word did they feed thy flock. Neither did they
give thy thepe drink of the stinking and dyrtie puddels of men's traditions /
but of the fountain of that living water / which springs unto everlasting
life. But now the shepehardes / yea / rather the wolfes Joan. 4. Vv^l^ish^
shepehardes.
/ which are braste into thy shepefolde / and with violence have unjustly
thrust out the faithful and fatherly pastores out of their tures / are lordely
/ cruel / bloudthyrstye / malicious and spyteful against thy sheep. They are
such wolfs as spare not the flock but scatter and destroy the flock. They
are thieves / robbers / murtheras and soul slears. Act. 20. Joan. 10. Ezec. 34.
they feed the^ selves with the fattest and clothe the^ selves with the
fyneste wolle / but thy flock thy noryshe not the food / wherewith they
pasture thy sheep / is the drowsyedrea^s and idle imaginacions of Antichriste.
In steed of the peachyng of thy lively word / the feed thy stock with latin

floche refuse to come and taste of those their pestilent poyso^s and poiso^ full
pestilences / him they accite to appear before that great wolf / whose face is
like unto the face of a she bear that is robbed of her young ones / whose eyes
continually burn with the vnque^cheable flames of the deadly cockatrice /
whose teethe are like to the venomous tethes The description of a certain

This wolf / o Lord / is so arroga^te / haultie and proud / seeing the

this cruel and bloody wolf deals with the poor lambs / even so do the

hunger and thyrste nothing so greatly / as the devouring of the bodies / and
the sucking of the blood of thy poor and innocent lambs. Psalm. 10.
Ah Lord / while the ungodly have the ouerhande / the poor are most
wretchedly handled. They are prays unto the wolfes. Arise therefore / o Lord
God / lift up thine hand / and forget not the poor / which gives them
self over into thy hand / and commits him unto thy defense. Break thou
the arm of the ungodly and malicious / search out the wickedness / which he
has done / that he may shortly perish from the land of the living. Suffer
thy sheep no more to be thus miserably scattered / rent / torn and devoured of
these mos^e cruel / grievous / and insatiable wolfes. Remember this thy
promise: Behold / I my self will upon the shepeherdes Eze. 34.
/ and require my sheep from their hands / and make them cease from feding of
my sheep / yea / the shepehardes shall feed them selfs no more. For I will
deliver my sheep out of their mouths / so that they shall not devour them
after this / etc. Behold / I Behold I will look to my sheep myselff and
seek them. Like as a sheppherde among the flock seakethe after the sheep that
arescattered abroad. Even so will* I seek aftere my sheep and gathere them
together out of all lands. I will bring theme into their own land / and
feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers / and in all the places
of the contre. I will feed theme ^^righte good pasturs / and upon the hye
mountains of Israel shall their foldes be. There shall there l^e in a good
fold and in a fat pastur shall they feed / even upon the mountains of
Israel. I will sede my shep my self and bring them to their rest / says the
Lord God. Su^he as be lost / will I seek / such as go astraye / will I bring
again such a^be wounded / will I bind up / such as be weak / will I make
strong / such as be fate and well liking / thosse will I preserve / and feed
them with the shynge that is Lawful / etc. I will help my sheep / so that
they shall no more be spoiled. I will make a covenant of peace with them / and
drive all evil beasts out of the Land / so that they may dwell saffely in
the wyldernes / and sleap in the words. Good fortune and p^ossperite will I
give them / and unto all that be round about my hill. A prossperous sh^wer
and ray^e will Ise^de theme in due season that / the trees in the wood may
bring forth their fruits / and the ground her increas. They shall be saff in
the land and shall know. That I am the Lord / which have broken their yoke
/ and delivered them out of the hands of those / that heylde them in
subieccione. O Lord. God and our heavenly father have pity on thy poor
afflicted and scattered flock / and according to theyes thy louy^ge and father
lie promysses deal with thy people. So shall all men understand / that thoue
art their Lord God and shepparde / and that they are thy people. and the
sheep of thy pastur / and by this means be occasioned to mangnifie and
