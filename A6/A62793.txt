to the Sergeant at Arms, and afterward in a violent manner forced into a
ship, and banished the Nation; and all this only for being called Quakers, and
without any cause at all showed them, or the transgression of any law charged
upon them. The particulars of the unjust proceedings against them, would be
large to relate; for they came into the Nation, and were made a blessing to us,
and the Lord wrought mightily by them to the turning of many from the darkness
to the Light, and from Satan's power unto God; and their conversation and
doctrine was such as truly answered the witness of God in our Consciences, to
the Converting of us unto the right way of God; and we may praise the Lord on
their behalf, who were made unto us Messengers of salvation, and instruments of
great good unto many, in faithful bearing the Testimony of the Lord amongst
us, to the glad tidings of our Souls. But such was the rage of the Priests
against them; that upon their lying complaints, by order from the then called
Deputy H. Cromwell and his Counsel, were apprehended by the high Shreife in
the City of Cork, and brought up by guards of horse to Dublin, and brought to
examination before Hen. and his Counsel; but no manner of Evil charged upon
them; though they were committed to the Sergeant at Arms, and kept prisoners
for many days, and unjustly sent away contrary to all law and equity; and
without any manner of reason shown to them for such proceedings; who could not
be convinced of the breach of any law, nor any other thing charged against them
saying that they were the servants of God, and thus for the name of Jesus they
were persecuted by unrighteous men; contrary to the law of God and of these
nations; likewise Ann Gold and Juliana Brown were also then banished by order
of the Counsel of Dublin, and James Lancaster and several others of the
Servants of the Lord were (by the said counsel) banished and many Ministers
have been haled out of meetings, when they have been declaring the word of
truth put into prisons and shamefully entreated.

and fined him forty pounds for saying, that Word was not the Scriptures that
divided between the joints and the marrow, and words to that purpose, and will
let none come to visit him but the Jailer; and the Officers of that Parish
fetched Robert Evanes a Friend in Dublin from a friends house upon a first day,
and made him go to Saint Patricks Church, and when he came there and spoke they
put him in prison, and such work they make in Dublin: And about 3 weeks ago
some Aldermen and Constables came to our meeting at Dublin, and haled Tho. Lo
and Sam. Clarage out of the meeting to Prison, and Captain Rich they carried
away, and broke up the meeting; and the same day we met again, the Officers
came and broke up the meeting the second time, and carried seven more Friends
to Prison, and tumbled Friends down the stairs, and broke down the meeting-Room
door, and pressed into the room, and broke down Timbers that kept up the floor,
and plucked a woman off her knees as she was praying, and made an uproar in the
City, and the next day swore before the Mayor (at the Town Hall) that we had
caused the Tumult, when as we sat quietly in our own hired room: and this work
they make, and no Justice can we get, for most of the former sufferings have
been laid before the Council at Dublin, and they refer us to the Judges of
Assize, and the Judges of Assize reports the matter to the Council back again,
and so they toss us up and down, that we cannot get so much as common Justice
amongst them. Also one Philip Dymond of Cork had a Pack of Wool taken from him
by the Mayor of Cork, upon the same account of not swearing to be a Freeman of
their Corporation, though he be a Freeman by the Wars: And the Mayor of Cork
sent Richard Brockelby a Clothier in Cork, to prison as a Traitor, for having a
few Books in his house, that another Friend wrote against two or three Priests
which had spoken against the truth; this the Mayor of Cork called Treason, and
caused the man's locks to be broken open, and his Books they carried away, and
the man not quite freed yet.

WE whose Names are here underwritten do witness, to the Truth of these
things, and much more cruelties, that have been acted and brought forth by
unjust Rulers in Ireland, against the people of God from time to time within
these five years, and there is always a continued suffering remains upon them,
because of the unjustness of some in Authority, and the unjust suffering of the
Lords people, is the overthrow of a Government, and the undoing of a Nation,
and brings the wrath and indignation of God upon a people, and because of these
things will the Lord overturn and overturn till the Kingdom of Christ be
established, and the Kingdoms of this World be changed, and become the Kingdoms
of the Lord and of his Christ: Wherefore ye Rulers of the Earth now be wise,
and fear the Lord God Almighty, who has all power in his hand, and pulls
down, and sets up whomsoever he will, at his own pleasure, his Rod is held
over you all; and if you ease the oppressed, and break the bonds of the
oppressors yoke, ye may be happy; but if you do not, the Lord will break you to
pieces, and ye shall never be healed.
