Joyful Tidings, etc.
THe Deliverer is come, let all that mourn wait for him, and let all lamps be
truly trimmed, and let all stand so prepared as that he may be known in his
coming, and be received and followed into the kingdom, for they that slumber
are in danger to miss him, and they that are hasty cannot find him, and on
these hands the kingdom is lost: therefore thou that mourns for him, and waits
to be delivered by him, keep thou in the faith, and in the patience stand thou
still, and join not with the careless, or with the forward spirits, but be
quiet in thy place, and keep thy eye in that which lets thee see thou wants
him, and the necessity to be delivered by him, and there thou standing still in
the watchfulness, he will come in an hour that thou know not of, for there
is not a groan that rises from the innocent in thee, but he has great regard
unto it, and his compassion breaks in the same hour, but for the time of
deliverance thou art to wait, because that hour no man must know: therefore let
all be still, and eye the Lord, for his hand is at work, and they that keep
their own hands quiet, will know his work to prosper, and in the stillnesse
will feel his faithfulness to his own begotten, for where does the Father
leave or forsake his own child, and in what place is it beset, and he helps it
not; and where is it in bondage, and he delivers it not: if the faith be kept,
and the patience continued in, he fails not in his work until he has performed
the counsel of his own will, for in his will the babe is begotten, and in his
will in due time it is born, and none can add unto his work; and therefore all
are to be still and quiet in the light, and therein watch and wait for his own
hour, so will he draw nigh unto thee that mourns for him, and with his arms of
mercy he will embrace thee, and take thee up, and heal thee, and carry thee
forth of the land of thy captivity, then shall thou return with joy indeed,
when thou art enclosed in the arms of thy beloved, and this is his own hour
which none can know until he come, and in this hour he binds up the
brokenhearted, and says to the weak, I am thy strength; and to the poor, I am
thy helper; and to the mourner, I am thy comforter; and to the captive, I am
thy deliverer; this is my hour, and I am come to set the free, thou have
patiently waited, and have not grudged; thou have been still, and have not
repined; and in thy lowest state my arm has reached to thee, and in all thy
distresses I have drawn nigh to succor thee: but this is the hour in which I
am come to deliver thee. O thou patient mourner, this is the voice of thy
beloved, hearken not unto another, for his word is sure, and all his promises
faithful, and behold he speaks comfortably to thee, and brings thee joyful
tidings of deliverance: turn not the face from him as if he was a stranger, for
it is he, and it is his hour, he has seen thy travail since the day he begat
thee, and in all thy afflictions he has been af^icted with thee, and he has
not delayed his coming though thou have thought him long, and in the depth of
thy misery have secretly cried, why does he not make have to help me, and why
are my afflictions so continued upon me, has he not in that hour been near
unto thee, and has he not in that time been thy comforter, and has he not
secretly relieved thee, though thou have not known it, and here he has been
thy support, that thou might not faint until his own hour came to deliver
thee. O that any who have been visited should miss of this hour, either by
carelessness or forwardness; for that which says he delays his coming that
is the careless spirit, and that which says, Behold he comes, let us go
forth to meet him, (mark) let us go forth that is the hasty forward spirit, it
leads forth of the faith, forth of the patience, forth of the stayednesse,
forth of the contentedness, and so from waiting in the pure and perfect
measure of light which comes from him, and in which he comes in his hour, and
neither of these births are delivered in a right hour, but are both born out of
due time, and the careless proves heavy and dies, and the forward proves a
vapor, which in its rise was something, but suddenly mounts into the air, and
after a while is no more seen; but the still quiet babe that waits in the true
patience, it is safely delivered in the time appointed, and in the hour
determined, and though it has been long bruised, yet it has patiently
endured, and though it has long sitten mourning, yet it has been contented,
and in the deepest of its misery, it has fled for refuge to the throne of
mercy, and has not been without some secret faith and hope in God, yea in the
very time when it could not see which way any relief should come, yet it has
breathed unto the Father, and has put its whole trust and confidence in him,
and so by a dependancie upon the life of its generation, it has lien under the
arm of preservation, it has not said he delays his coming, and I am weary of
waiting, neither has it said, behold he comes, I will go forth to meet him,
but here I lie bruised, and my mourning is not hid from him, and here I will
wait for the hour of his coming, I have no strength to move until he come and
help me; and therefore he must find me where I am, and do all for me that is to
be done, or here I must lie and mourn out my days. I dare not slumber least I
should miss his coming, nor I dare not go forth to meet him, least I should
not find him, but here will I sit and wait for his own hour. O thou babe of
tenderness, that watchest for thy beloved with diligence, thou art the object
of the Fathers pity, and he is not forgetful of thee, neither indeed can he,
for thou art his natural child, a babe of his own begetting, and in thy travail
he is with thee, and in all thy distresses he comforts thee, and in thy deep
afflictions he is a support unto thee; thou art the bruised, and he is come to
heal thee; the mourner, and he is come to comfort thee; the captive, and he is
come to deliver thee; this is his hour, though the powers of darkness be
strong, Oh thou innocent babe, thou art deeper in feeling then words can
express, there is none knows thy travail but who are of the same life with
thee, neither can any eye truly pity thee but the eye which only has
compassion on thee, thou art the babe which in all thy afflictions lives by
faith, and though thou have not deliverance in thy view, yet through thy faith
thou art stayed in him that loves thee, and in his strength thou stand in
the time of thy adversity, and he in all things works for thee because thou
art nothing in thy self, and wherever thou art his power defends thee, and in
thy poverty his pleasure and delight is in thee, for his covenant stands sure
with thee for ever. Oh thou glorious birth of immortality, thou art
well-beloved and highly favored of God, yea in the womb he loves thee and
favors thee, and from the day of his deliverance, and the hour of thy birth he
delights to honor thee, for out of all earthly families he has chosen thee,
and from all false births he separates thee, and the Gentiles glory he will
give unto thee, and the high places of the earth he will make thy footstool,
the glory of thy rising vanish^th the night, the appearance of thy beauty makes
a perfect day, all clouds scatter before thee, and all earthly fogs and mists
clears up at thy presence, the lights of heaven withdraws at thy rising, for
the luster of thy brightness excells all borrowed lights, and thou swallowest
them up into thy glorious body, and with the splendor of thy own breakings
forth thou covers them as if they were not; there is no mixture in thee, no
dross nor tin cleavs unto thee, for the furnace has separated all earthly
matter from thee, that thy life may shine forth in perfect purity, and thou
alone may rule the day which belongs unto thee; Oh thou art the precious Jewel
in which is unity, none can be bound up but in thee, none can inherit the
Kingdom besides thee, for the Father has prepared it only for thee, and there
thou must dwell alone, and not be numbered with transgressors any more, thy
glory goes over the earth, and thy renown ascends above the Heavens, and both
earth and Heaven must give up unto thee, for thou art the Son, and all must
worship thee, all below thee is earthly, all above thee is airy, but in thy
life is perfect temperance, and everlasting substance, and there is nothing
endures or remains besides thee, all the Virgins are in love with thee, the
sweet savor of thy ointment draws them after thee, and they cannot deny thee,
nor forsake thee, but where ever thou go they are constrained to follow
thee, and in thy love they rejoice in union with thee, and sings thy praise in
the heavenly harmony.

Oh Sion! put on thy strength, and cast thy mourning garments from thee, for
the most high Remembers thee in everlasting mercy, he has seen the time of thy
widowhood, and the days of thy long captivity, he has beheld thy solitary
places, and the years of thy great adversity, and now he is drawing nigh to
work deliverance for thee, and to gather thee out of all places, where thou
have been scattered, and from amongst all strangers by whom thou have been
oppressed, and to advance thy holy hill over all the earthly glory, that he
alone may dwell in thee and delight himself in thy lovely beauty, therefore let
thy mourning be turned into joy, and thy sorrow into songs of praises, for thy
deliverer is come, and he smiles upon thee with a lovely countenance, and the
praise of the whole earth shall thou be, says the Lord, who does all these
things.

Let the tongue of the dumb be unloosed, and read the joyful tidings within,
where the Lord is redeeming his chosen, and raising up his Seed which obtains
evelasting blessings. A few words of Counsel unto Friends, concerning Marriage.
THe Honorable Marriage is in the Seed of God, Male and Female in the seed are
one, and lies down together in the bed undefiled, where God blesses them and
their Seeds Seed for ever, therefore let all friends eye the Lord in this his
day, and keep faithful to the leadings of his power, lest the sons and
daughters of strangers entice any of your minds to join with them, and so you
go into the defiled bed and loose the honor; and be watchful that you run not
forth in a hasty eager mind among your selves, but wait that ye may have
clearness in the counsel of the Lord, that so ye may understand that it is of
God in the beginning, for if you keep not stayed in the light, with the light
to be guided; you may either look at the world or at the party, as the first
thing upon which you fix your eye, and so may labor to compass the party
either for the love of the worlds riches which they may possess, or to
satisfy your affections with the outward beauty or comeliness of the person,
and so the drawings and leadings of God will not be regarded; but the worlds
riches, or the persons comeliness, or both, will be the object of your eye, and
whoever begins in this ground, the Lord will blast it, and if any come to feel
that they have a real moving in the truth and in simplicity one to another, and
that in the beginning they look singly at the begotten of God one in another,
then wait to be preserved and kept in Gods fear and counsel; for here the enemy
will stand to present some temptation to entice and entangle the minds, and if
ever you open your eye into the world, and begin to look at the glory and
honor of it, that part will presently over balance the real simplicity, and
then the eye being fixed upon the worlds riches and glory, the enemy hatches a
secret design which way to compass it, and attain it, and then the temptation
becomes a cloud and a vail over the excellent glory of the beautiful seed, and
if that eye which looks into the world, and lusts to compass it, be not
answered in its desire, then the love which has been professed will decay, and
cool, and die, but and if that end can be obtained which the eye looks after,
then the love will seemingly increase to a joining in the Covenant of Marriage,
and this is not honorable though outwardly it may be brought to pass and
effected, and whosoever goes together in this ground, they will suffer loss in
the truth, though they may gain the worlds substance, and death will surprise
them in the earth where they center, and how are many tossed about and cannot
find where to settle, nor where to come into a liking to satisfy their
wandering eye, but sometimes will draw a conclusion one way, and instantly turn
from it again, and presently join with some new presentation which in its
appearance seems to show fairer unto their liking; and thus many staggers up
and down in the multitude of their own thoughts, and never waits to feel the
Lords power to order them, but through the wiles of the enemy are hurried in a
restless state and looses their conditions in the truth, and does not well
perceive it, for if either strangers be joined unto, or the world or beauty be
first looke^ at, or the world catch the mind from the real movings in the
simplicity, or whatsoever end any lays to themselves in this matter, they
through the same will come to great loss in the truth, whether the thing which
they aim at be effected or not effected, for if the mind be drawn into any
visible appearance as to have a lust after it, and to prescribe ways and ends
to accomplish what is intended, there cannot be a clear standing in the truth,
where the mind is exercised about the attaining or effecting any such things,
for they all stand in the liberty of the will, and not in in the power of God
which crosses it.

Therefore this is the counsel of the Lord God unto all friends, look not at
the sons or daughters of strangers, lest you become one with them, neither look
at the worlds riches amongst your selves, but wait low in Gods fear to receive
his counsel in every such motion, and feel his hand to open the way for you,
and when you feel a clear way opened of the Lord, and that in his eternal power
and wisdom you can reach the Seed one in another, then wait for his time to
make you up as one in the counsel of his own will, and when thus you feel his
hand at work, then do not you begin to say, we have clearness from the Lord in
this matter, but now we would know how it must be as to an outward portion or
estate, and so begin to look into the earth, and confer one with another
about the things of this life, for if any do so, the Lord will draw back his
hand, and hide his counsel from you, and will leave you in the dark to grope in
your own way, and though you may obtain those things which your eye in that
place looks after, and may effect the thing which you aim at, yet there you
cannot obtain the Lords favor and blessing, not that the world or the riches
of it is hereby denied in their places, for if the Lord join any together in
the Seed, and that the things of this life be enjoyed by either party as an
outward portion, there they may prove serviceable as in God^ wisdom they are
used, and the increase will be blessed, but where the world is chiefly looked
at, and that the joining or not joining depende^^ upon it, in that place it is
denied and not otherwise, and let not any Friends make way one for another by
speaking to any party, except they feel a necessity laid upon them from the
Lord, for thereby some may be wronged in their simplicity, by giving up their
belief unto another, but let all wait to feel their own movings in Gods
counsel and leadings, and so to manifest their own mind in his fear and
wisdom, that it may be felt on both sides to be of the Lord, and then lay it
before some weighty friends that are endued with heavenly wisdom, that the
ground of the motion may be balanced in sound judgment, and so to wait for the
Lords hand to carry it on and finish it in his pleasure, and where it thus
comes to pass in a single heart to God and one another, there will be true
contentment with what the world affords on either part, and whether it be more
or less, it will be enjoyed in its place with comfort and peace; and though
parties may differ much in age, or in outward substance, yet the marriage is
equal, because it is of the Lord, for equality stands not in age or wealth
according to the worlds account, but in the prosperity of the seed, in which
both age and youth becomes one flesh, and is made to flourish in one perfect
beauty, and has an equal portion of wealth in the enduring substance, and who
are thus joined together of the Lord, and abides faithful with him, his
blessing rests upon them every way, and he preserves them fresh and living in
his truth, for where death runs over any in that state, it is because the thing
is not brought to pass in Gods counsel, or otherwise not abiding faithful with
him when it is effected by him, and so the world becomes a trap and a snare to
entangle, and fond affections becomes a hinderance for following the Lord
fully. Therefore let all friends be exceeding careful in this weighty matter,
which in the ground lies beyond the reach of the earthly wisdom, and can never
be effected by it, to the glory of God, or the honor of his truth, nor to the
peace and happiness of such as so obtains it, but where it is begun and
finished in the counsel and will of God, and that there be an abiding faithful
with him, he has the glory in it, and his peace and blessing remains with such
as a continual portion of endless joy.

Oh this is the day wherein the lamb espouses the undefiled virgin which has
followed him through great tribulations, and is washed white in his precious
blood.
