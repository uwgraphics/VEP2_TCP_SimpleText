TO THE LOYAL Company of CITIZENS MET AT Merchant-Tailors Hall.
10 Aug. 1682.
They Are Met, they are Sat, and Loyal Cups go round,
And with their Cheers the well built Walls rebound.
The Trojans thus rejoiced, when they to Groves,
From stormy Billows had their first removes.
When Seven fat Bucks Aeneas did impart
To Ilions Youth, and bid 'em all take Heart.
Since from black stormy Gusts and a rough Sea
That lately tossed, by Skilful Hands set free,
They there enjoyed a sweet Serenity.
Bring out the Bowl, methinks I hear 'em cry,
Which Belus, and all Belus Progeny
Was wont with Sacred Wine to th'brim to Crown,
And let it to Great CHARLES and his go down.
And in the interim let some loved Youth tell,
Famed as Iopas, while each string does swell,
In Sacred Lore how His Great Father fell.
Then sigh each Loyal Soul for's Master slain,
Then Cheerly cry, His Heirs we will maintain,
Successively on the same Throne to Reign.
Thus doing, Loyal LONDON never may want
The Charters had when she was Troynovant.
Thus doing, this August and Solemn Treat,
Will make New LONDON as old Carthage great;
When true Aeneas and his Faithful Band,
Queen Dido's Royal Table entertained.
