The Whiggs Lamentation, For or the Tap of Sedition.
The Tap it is stolen, the Liquor fled
Be joyful then the Devil's dead.
^LAment you Whiggs, you Presbyter Priggs, Your Godfather Tony is dead: Let
Titus ^ now, for Holland go, it is time that he was fled.

Let Waller, Prance, and Pilkinton dance
With all the Shreeval Knot,
For the Devil has stolen the Tapp away
And the Cask it is quite run out.
Let Quaking Jack, make up his pack
And to Pensilvania hye,
And the Sister hood, with all the brood
Who Rail against Monarchy:
For the Politic pate, once Member of state
Is vanquished without doubt,
Old Nick he has stolen the Tap away
And the Cask it is quite run out.
Association once in fashion
May be again preferred
No Ignoramus, more shall sham us
Tony is now interred:
His rotten Cask is laid in clay
Sedition under ground
For the Devil has hid the Tap away
Where 'twill no more be found.
Sallamank, Doctor, have to the Proctor
Thou art left his Heir
Search thou his Will, find some new Bill
That you afresh may swear,
Find some new trick, to save thy neck
For all your Plots are found
The Devil has stolen the Tap away
And buried the Cask in the ground.
Think of your Lies, false Perjuries,
Swore against Prince and Peers,
Your damned deceipts, and Wapping cheats
Set the Nation by the Ears
Oh now prepare, avoid a snare
Least thou art ketcht in the Pound
For the Devil has stolen the Tap away
And laid the Cask under ground.
Repent Whigs all, you down must fall
And Loyal boys must rise,
May all that plots, be hanged in knots
Who do their King despise
A health to the King, brave Albony
And his Consort in the bed
Then let us rejoice and merrily sing
Hey boys the Devil's dead.
FINIS.
