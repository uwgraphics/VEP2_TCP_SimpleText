WESTMINSTER-DROLLERY.
The first Song in the Ball at Court.
1.
I Pass all my Hours in a shady old Grove,
And I live not the day that I see not my Love:
I survey every Walk now my Phillis is gone,
And sigh when I think we were there all alone.
O then it is, O then I think there is no such Hell,
Like loving, like loving to well.
2.
But each shade and each conscious Bower that I find,
Where I once have been happy, and she has been kind,
And I see the print left of her shape in the Green,
And imagine the pleasure may yet come again,
O then it is, O then I think no joy's above
The pleasures, the pleasures of love.
3.
While alone to my self I repeat all her charms,
She I love may be locked in another man's arms:
She may laugh at my cares, and so false she may be,
To say all the kind things she before said to me.
O then it is, O then I think there is no such Hell,
Like loving, like loving too well.
4.
But when I consider the truth of her heart,
Such an innocent passion, so kind, without art,
I fear I have wronged her, and hope she may be
So full of true love, to be jealous of me.
O then it is, O then I think no joys above
The pleasures, the pleasures of Love.
The second Song in the Masque at Court.
1.
A Lover I am, and a Lover I Will be,
And hope from my Love I shall never be free.
Let wisdom be blamed in the grave woman-hater,
Yet never to love, is a sin of ill nature:
But he who loves well, and whose passion is strong,
Shall never be wretched, but ever be young.
2.
With hopes and with fears, like a Ship in the Ocean,
Our hearts are kept dancing, and ever in motion.
When our passion is pallid, and our fancy would sail,
A little kind quarrel supplies a fresh gale:
But when the doubt's cleared, and the jealousi's gone,
How we kiss, and embrace, and can never have done.
A Song at the King's House.
1.
HOw hard is a heart to be cured
That is once overwhelmed with despair,
It Is a pain by force is endured,
Despises our pity, and scoffs at our fear:
But if nothing but Death shall untie
Those fetters wherewith you enslave me,
For your sake I am ready to try
If you are unwilling to leave me,
Then I am not unwilling to die.
2.
How much were it better complying
With the tears, the sighs, and the groans
Of a poor distressed Lover dying,
And list to the cries of his pitiful moans:
When your Slave shall in triumph be led
To see the effects of good nature,
It shall for your honor be sed,
It Is true you have killed a poor Creature,
Yet have raised him again from the dead.
3.
Though your heart be as cold as the ice is,
At one time or other you will find,
That love has a thousand devices
To banish could thoughts from your scrupulous mind.
Thy aid mighty Jove I implore,
That thou to the fair one discover,
The joys I have for her in store,
Which she to her passionate Lover
Will say, she will be cruel no more.
A Song at the Kings House.
1.
CLoris, let my passion ever,
Be to you as I design:
Flames so noble, that you never
Saw the like till you knew mine.
2.
Not a breath of seigned passion
From my lips shall reach your ears;
Nor this love that is now in fashion;
Made of modest sighs and tears.
3.
In my breast a room so sitting
For your heart I will prepare,
That you will never think of quitting,
Were you once but harbored there.
4.
The Rent's not great that I require
From your heart, mine to repay:
Fortitude's all I desire
To keep your lodging from decay.
5.
Fairest Saint, then be not cruel,
Nor to love me count i^ sin;
Since a smile from you is fuel,
For to keep this fire in.
6.
When I am forced by death or age,
From your flames for to retire,
All true Lovers I Will engage
Still my passion to admire.
The last Song at the Kings House.
1.
A Wife I do hate,
For either she is false, or she is jealous;
But give me a Mate
That nothing will ask or tell us:
She stands on no terms,
Nor chaffers by way of Indenture;
Her love's for your Farms,
But takes the kind man at a venture.
2.
If all prove not right,
Without Act, Process, or Warning,
From a Wife for a night
You may be divorced in the morning.
Where Parents are slaves
Their Brats cannot be any other;
Great Wits and great Braves
Have always a P^nk to their M^ther.
A Song.
1.
WEr'^ thou but half so wise as thou art fair,
Thou would not need such courting,
'Twill prove a loss you will never repair,
Should you still defer your sporting.
This peevish shall I, shall I, you will repent,
When your spring is over,
Beauties after -- math -- no kind friends has
To gratify a Lover.
2.
Perhaps you may think it is a sin to deal,
Till Hymen does authorize you:
Though the Gods themselves sweet pleasure steal,
That to coyness thus advise you.
Pox upon the Link-boy and his Taper,
I Will kiss, although not have you,
'Twas an Eunuch wrote all the Text that you quote,
And the Ethics that inslave you.
3.
I am sure you have heard of that sprightly Dame
That with Mars so often traded,
Had the God but thought she had been to blame,
She had surely been degraded.
Nor is blind Cupid less esteemed
For the sly tricks of his Mother,
For men do adore that Son of a Whore,
As much as any other.
4.
It Is plain antiquity dothlie
Which made Lucretia squeamish;
For that which you call Chastity.
Upon her left a blemish:
For when her Paramour grew weak,
Her passion waxed stronger,
For the Lecherous Drab her self did stab
'Cause ^arquin staid no longer.
5.
Then away with this Bugbear Vice,
You are lost if that you fly me,
In Ell^ium (if you here are nice)
You never shall come nigh me:
Hell for V^stals is a Cloister
I don't run doting thither,
For the pleasant shades are for her that trades:
Let Us truck and go together.
A late Song by a Person of Quality.
1.
ALas, what shall I do? I have taken on me now
To make a Song, I vow; O woe is me:
I am commanded to it, I dare nor stand it out,
Though I am put to the rout, it must be:
Thou shall do it, then stand to it, I Will set my Muse (...) for
With a good chirping Cup,
There may some hidden Mine, spring from the jui^^ of wine*
Then take it and drink it up.
2.
Pox on it, it will not do, I must have the other too,
I claim it as my due, and must love't;
For where the Land is dry, the good Husband he does hi^
To bring the water nigh to improve't.
He^e's the use of the Juice, open me then the sluice,
And deny my wit in grain;
That Skull's never empty that takes it in plenty,
It Is the only spring of the brain.
3.
Madam now you may see what obedience is in me,
I have done what may be to obey,
I have set my Muse on foot, with the sprightly grape to boot,
Your Commands made me do it, they must sway:
If my pate soon or late, shall bring forth some conceit,
To you my wit I owe.
If I do fall flat, its because, mark you that,
I am a Cup to low.
If I spoke sense enough, or did speak but stuff,
All is alike to me;
I Will never pause upon it, you were the cause on it,
And that is my Apology.
Silvia. Made by a Person of Honor. But the Answer and Reply lately added.
SIlvia, tell me how long it will be
Before you will grant my desire:
Is there no end of your cruelty,
But must I consume in this fire?
You Will not tell me you love me, nor yet that you hate,
But take pleasure in seeing me languish
Ah Silvia pity my desperate state,
For you are the cause of my anguish:
Her ANSWER.
DAmon, I tell thee I never shall be
In a humor to grant thy desire;
Nor can I be taxed with cruelty,
Having one that I more do admire.
For it is him that I love, and thee that I hate,
Yet I find you fain would be doing;
No, Damon, you never shall be my Mate,
Then prithee, Friend, leave off thy wooing.
His REPLY.
SILVIA know, I never shall more
Be a Suitor to pride and disdaining,
Nor can my respects be as heretofore,
Being now in the time of their waining:
For I prize not thy love, nor I fear not thy hate,
Then prithee take it for a warning,
Whenever you meet with another mate,
Faith Silvia leave off your scorning.
A Song at the Kings House.
1.
Wherever I am, and whatever I do,
My Phillis is still in my mind:
When angry, I mean not to Phillis to go,
My feet of themselves the way find.
Unknown to my self, I am just at her door,
And when I would rail, I can bring out no more.
Than, Phillis too fair and unkind.
Than, Phillis too fair and unkind.
2.
When Phillis I see, my heart burns in my breast,
And the love I would stifle is shown,
But asleep or wake, I am never at rest,
When from mine eyes Phillis is gone.
Sometimes a sweet dream does delude my sad mind,
But alas when I wake, and no Phillis I find,
Then I sigh to my self all alone,
Then I sigh to my self all alone.
3.
Should a King be my Rival in her I adore,
He should offer his treasure in vain,
O let me alone to be happy and poor,
And give me my Phillis again:
Let Phillis be mi^e, and ever be kind,
IN could to a Desert with her be confined,
And envy no Monarch his Reign,
And envy no Monarch his Reign.
4.
Alas! I discover too much of my love,
And she too well knows her own power;
She makes me each day a new Martyrdom prove,
And makes me grow jealous each hour.
But let her each minute torment my poor mind,
I had rather love Phillis both false and unkind,
Then ever be freed from her power,
Then ever be freed from her power.
The Coy Lady slighted at last.
1.
POor Celia once was very fair,
A quick bewitching eye she had,
Most neatly looked her braided hair,
Her lovely cheeks would make you mad^
Upon her Lips did all the Graces play,
And on her Breasts ten thousand Cupids lay.
2.
Then many a doting Lover came,
From seventeen unto twenty one:
Each told her of his mighty flame,
But she forsooth affected none;
This was not handsome, the other was not fine;
This of Tobacco s^elt, and that of Wine.
3.
But the other day it was my fate
To pass along that way alone:
I saw no Coach before her Gate,
But at her door I heard her moan,
And dropped a tear, and sighing seemed to say,
Young Ladies marry, marry while you may.
A Song at the Kings House.
1.
WOrld thou art so wicked grown,
That thy deceits I must disown,
Since Knaves from honest men cannot be known,
So general is Distraction:
2.
Men that are grave and should be wise,
In their opinions are so precise,
That always they turn up the whites of their eyes,
When plotting some other faction.
Conventicles are grown so rife,
Whose followers are so many,
There Is so much gathered for their relief,
Poor Cavaliers cannot get any.
Wit without money is such a curse,
No Mortal would be in its Clutches:
And he that has one without the other is worse
Than a Cripple without his Crutches.
A Song by a Person of Quality.
HOld, hold, and no further advance,
For I Am cast i^ a Trance,
If an inch more you give,
I Am not able to live,
Then draw back your Lance.
So now it is pretty well my Love,
Yet if you will,
You may somewhat further shove,
But do not kill.
I die, I die, my breath's almost gone;
Pray let me sleep, and I Will wake anon.
A Rhodomantade on his cruel Mistress.
SEek not to know a woman; for she is worse
Than all Ingredients crammed into a Curse.
Were she but ugly, prevish, proud, a Whore,
Perjured or painted, so she were no more,
I could forgive her, and connive at this,
Alleging still she but a Woman is:
But she is worse, and may in time forestal,
The Devil, and be the damning of us all.
A SONG. A Dialogue between two Friends. Tune, How severe is forgetful old age.
R. HOw unhappy a Lover am I,
VVh^lst I sigh for my Phyllis in vain,
All my hopes of delight are another man's right,
Who is happy whilst I am in pain.

W. 2.
Since her honor affords no relief,
As to pity the pains which you bear,
It Is the best of your Fate in a helpless estate,
To give over betimes to despair.

R. 3.
I have tried the false Medicine in vain,
Yet I wished what I hope not to win,
From without my desires has no food to its fires,
But it burns and consumes me within.

W. 4.
Yet at best it is a comfort to know
That you are not unhappy alone;
For the Nymph you adore is as wretched or more,
And accounts all your sufferings her own.

R. 5.
O you Powers let me suffer for both,
At the feet of my Phyllis I Will lie,
I Will resign up my breath, and take pleasure in death,
To be pitied by her when I die.

W. 6.
What her honor denied you in life,
In her death she will give to her love:
Such a flame as is true after fate will renew,
For the souls do meet freely above.

A SONG called The Injured Lady.
1.
O You powerful Gods, if I must be
An injured Offering to Loves Deity,
Grant my Revenge, this Plague on men,
That Women never may love again.
Then I Will with joy submit unto my Fate,
Which by your Justice gives your Empire date.
2.
Depose that great insulting Tyrant Boy,
Who most is pleased when he does most destroy:
O let the world no longer governed be
By such a blind and childish Deity.
For if you Gods are in your Power severe,
We shall adore you not for Love but Fear.
3.
But if you will his Divinity maintain,
('It Is men, false men, confirm his tottering re^gn)
And when their hearts Loves greatest torment prove
Let that no pity, but our laughter move.
Thus scorned and lost to all their wished for aim,
Let rage, despair, and death consume their flame.
The Wooing Rogue. The Tune ^s, My Freedom is all my Joy.
1.
COme live with me, and be my Whore,
And we will be^ from door to door,
Then under a hedge we will sit and louse us,
Until the Beadle comes to rouse us,
And if the^'l give us no relief,
Thou shall turn Whore and I Will turn Thief.
Thou shall turn Whore and I Will turn Thief.
2.
If thou can rob, then I can steal,
And we will eat Roast-meat every meal:
Nay, we will eat White-bread every day,
And throw our moldy Crusts away,
And twice a day we will be drunk,
And then at night I Will kiss my Punk.
And then at night I Will kiss my Punk.
3.
And when we both shall have the Pox,
We then shall want both Shirts and Smocks,
To shift each others mangy hide,
That is with Itch so pockifi'd;
We Will take some clean ones from a hedge,
And leave our old ones for a pledge.
And leave our old ones for a pledge.
A Song at the Kings House.
1.
HOw severe is forgetful old age,
To confine a poor Lover so,
That I almost despair to see even the air,
Much more my dear Damon, hey ho.
2.
Though I whisper my sighs out alone,
Yet I am traced wherever I go,
That some treacherous Tree keeps this old man from me
And there he counts every hey ho.
3.
How shall I this Argus blind,
And so put an end to my woe?
But whilst I beguile all his frowns with a smile,
I betray my self with a hey ho.
4.
My restraint then, alas, must endure;
So that since my sad doom I know,
I will pine for my Love like the Turtle-Dove,
And breath out my life in hey ho.
A Song at the King's House.
1.
NEver persuade me to it, I vow
I live not: How can thou
Expect a life in me,
Since my Soul is sled to thee?
You suppose because I walk,
And you think talk,
I therefore breath, alas, you know
Shades as well as men do so.
2.
You may argue I have heat,
My pulses beat,
My sighs have in them living fire.
Grant your Argument be truth,
Such heats my youth
In^lame, as poisons do only prepare
To make death their follower.
A Song.
Farewell, farewell fond love, under whose childish whip
I have served out a weary Prenticeship.
Farewell, thou that have made me thy scorned property,
To dote on those that loved not,
And to sly those that wooed me:
Go bane of my content, and practice on some other Patient.
2.
My woeful Monument shall be a Cell,
The murmur of the purling Brook my knell;
And for my Epitaph the Rocks shall groan
Eternally: if any ask this Stone,
What wretched thing does in this compass lie,
The hollow Echo shall reply, It Is I, It Is I.
The hollow Echo shall reply, It Is I.
Farewell, farewell.
A Song at the King's House.
1.
HAve I not told thee, dearest mine,
That I destroyed should be?
Unhappy, though the crime was thine,
And mine the misery:
Thou art not kind, there is none so blind
As those that will not see.
2.
Have I not sighed away my breath
In homage to thy beauty:
What have I got but certain death,
A poor reward for duty.
Well, when I Am gone you will never have one
That will prove half so true to ye.
3.
Have I not steeped my soul in tears,
When thou did hardly mind it?
But rather added to my fears,
When love should have declined it?
Which in this breast, I hope for rest,
But now despair to sind it.
4.
O that I could but sound thy heart,
And fathom but thy mind:
Then would I search thy better part,
And force thee to be kind:
But now I Am lost, and here am crossed,
It Is they that hide must find.
4.
If pity then within thy heart
Does own a residence,
Vouchsafe to read my tragic part,
And plead my innocence:
Then when I Am dead, it may be said,
'Twas love was my offense.
5.
But since thy will is to destroy,
I dare not mercy crave,
But kindly thank my fate, and joy
I lived to die thy Slave:
Then exercise those killing eyes,
And frown me to my grave:
A Song.
LOve, fare thee well,
Since no love can dwell
In thee, that in hatred do all excel.
2.
All Love is blind,
Yet none more unkind,
Than those that repay Love with a proud mind.
3.
Love that is Divine,
Is not Love like to mine,
Since she does laugh, when I do repine.
Then gent^e Love for Loves own sake,
Sigh loving Soul, and break heart, break.
A Song.
1.
MAny declare what torments there are,
Yet none ever felt so much of despair:
No love can tell how high my griefs swell.
O cursed be the pride that reduced me to Hell.
2.
My heart is on fire, whilst I do admire
That you with disdain requite my desire:
All must cease, that my flames may increase,
And cursed be the pride that murdered my peace.
A Song at the Kings House.
BRight Celia, know 'twas not thine eyes
Alone that first did me surprise;
The Gods use seldom to dispense
To your Sex Beauty and Conscience;
If then they have made me untrue,
The fault lies not in me, but you:
Sure it is no crime to break a Vow,
When we are first I know not how.
2.
You press me an unusual way,
To make my Song my Love betray:
Yet fear you will turn it to a jest,
And use me as you have done the rest
Of those sad Captives which complain,
Yet are enamored of their slame:
And though they die for love of you,
Dare neither love nor you pursue.
3.
If love be sin, why live you then
To make so many guilty men?
Since it is not in the power of Art
To make a Breast Plate for the heart:
Since it is your eyes Loves Shafts convey
Into our souls a secret way;
Where if once sixth, no Herb nor Charm
Can cure us of our inward harm.
A Song.
1.
ALl the flatteries of Fate,
And the glories of State,
Are nothing so sweet as what Love does create:
If Love you deny,
It Is time I should die;
Kind Death's a reprieve when you threaten to hate.
2.
In some shady Grove
Will I wander and rove,
With Philomel and the Disconsolate Dove:
With a down-hanging wing
Will I mournfully sing
The Tragic events of Unfortunate Love.
3.
With our plaints we will conspire
For to heighten Loves fire,
Still vanquishing life, till at last we expire:
But when we are dead,
In a cold leafy bed
Be interred with the D^rge of this desolate Q^ire.
A Song at the Kings House.
1.
LOve that is skrew'd a pitch too high,
May speak, but with a squeeze will die:
The solid Lover knows not how
To play the Changeling with his Vow:
Small sorrows may find vent, and break,
Great ones will rather burst than speak.
Such is my fortune when my Flora frowns,
Not only me, but she the world will drown.
2.
Thus am I drenched in misery,
Yet hope she may be kind to me:
I, but it is long first, could she but restrain
Those kindnesses which I Would be glad to gain,
She Will surely do'^: if so, it shall be known
I loved her for her own sake, not my own.
Thus will I live and die, and so will be
Exemplary to all Posterity.
A Song.
1.
WHat care I though the world reprove
My bold, my over-daring love:
Ignoble minds themselves exempt
From interest in a brave attempt.
2.
The Eagle soaring to behold
The Sun aray'd in flames of gold,
Regards not though she burns her wings,
Since that rich sight such pleasure brings.
3.
So feel I now my smiling thought
To such a resolution brought,
That it contemns all grief and smart,
Since I so high have placed my heart.
4.
And if I die, some worthy Spirits
To future times shall sing my merits,
That easily did my life despise,
Yet never forsook my enterprise.
5.
Then shine bright S^n, and let me see
The glory of thy Majesty:
I wish to die, so I may have
Thy look, my death; thine eye, my grave.
A Song.
1.
BUrn and consume, burn wretched heart,
Unhappy in extremes thou art:
If dying looks serve not thy turn,
To say thy Beauty makes me burn,
2.
From thoughts inslam'd pale colors fume
Into my face, and it consume:
O my poor heart, what charms thee so,
That thy afflicted face lets know,
3.
Yet will not tell who murders thee,
But yet will still a Lover be:
Who hides my Phoenix eyes, that she,
Whom I adore thus cannot see,
4.
How I for her am made a prey
To sorrow: and do pine away:
O foolish c^stom and vile use,
My silence now deserves no truce.
A Song at the Dukes House.
O Fain would I before I die
Bequeath to thee a Legacy:
That thou may say, when I am gone,
None had my heart but thee alone:
Had I as many hearts as hairs,
As many lives as Lovers fears,
As many lives as years have hours,
They all and only should be yours.
Dearest, before you condescend
To entertain a bosom Friend,
Be sure you know your servant well,
Before your liberty you sell:
For love's a fire in young and old,
It Is sometimes hot, and sometimes cold;
And men you know that when they please,
They can be sick of Loves disease.
Then wisely choose a Friend that may
Last for an age, and not a day;
Who loves thee not for lip or eye,
But for thy mutual sympathy.
Let such a Friend thy heart engage,
For he will comfort thee in age,
And kiss thy furrowed wrinkled brow
With as much joy as I do now.
A Song called, And to each pretty Lass we will give a green Gown.
1.
THus all our life long we are frolic and gay,
And instead of Court-revels, we merrily play
At Trap, at Rules, and at Barly-break run:
At Goff, and at Football, and when we have done
These innocent sports, we will laugh and lie down,
And to each pretty L^ss
We will give a green Gown.
2.
We teach our little Dogs to fetch and to carry:
The Partridge, the Hare, the Pheasant's our Quarry:
The nimble Sqirrils with cudgels we will chase,
And the little pretty Lark we betray with a Glass.
And when we have done, etc.
3.
About the May Pole we dance all in a round,
And with Garlands of Pinks and Roses are crowned*
Our little kind tribute we cheerfully pay
To the gay Lord and the bright Lady of the May.
And when we have done, etc.
A Song.
1.
ON the bank of a Brook as I sa^e fishing,
Hid in the Oziers that grew on the side:
Iover-heard a Nymph and Shepherd wishing,
No time nor fortune their Love might divide.
To Cupid and Venus each offered a Vow,
To love ever as they loved now.
2.
O, said the Shepherd, and sighed, What a pleasure
Is Love concealed betwixt Lovers alone?
Love must be secret, for like fairy treasure,
When it is discovered 'twill quickly be gone.
For Envy and Jealousy, if it will stay,
Would, alas soon make it decay.
3.
Then let us leave this world and care behind us,
Said the Nymph, smiling, and gave him her hand
All alone, all alone, where none shall find us,
In some fair Desert we will seek a new Land,
And there live from Envy and Jealousy free,
And a World to each other we'll be.
A Song.
1.
CEllamina, of my heart
None shall e'^e bereave you:
If by your good leave I may
Quarrel with you once a day
I will never leave you.
2.
Passion's but an empty name,
Where respect is wanting;
Damon, you mistake your aim,
Hang your heart, and dam your slame,
If you must be ranting.
3.
Love as pale and muddy is,
As decaying Liquor:
Anger sets it on the Lees,
And resines it by degrees,
Till it w^rks it quicker.
4.
Love by anger to beget,
Wisely you endeavor,
With a grave Physician wit,
Who to cure an ague fit,
Puts me in a Feavour.
5.
Anger rowseth Love to fight,
And its only bait is,
It Is the guide to dull delight,
And is but an eager bite
When desire at height is.
6.
If such drops of heat do fall,
In our wooing weather,
If such drops of heat do fall,
We shall have the Devil and all,
When we come together.
A Song at the Kings house.
BEneath a Myrtle shade,
Which none but Love for happy Lovers made,
I slept, and straight my Love before me brought
Phillis, the object of my waking thought.
Undrest she came, my flames to meet,
Whilst Love strewn flowers beneath her feet:
Flowers, that so pressed by her, became more sweet.
2.
From the bright Virgins head,
A careless Veil of Lawn was loosely spread*
From her white Temple fell her shady hair,
Like cloudy Sunshine, not too brown nor fair,
Her hands, her lips did love inspire,
Her every Grace my heart did fire,
But most her eyes, that languish with desire.
3.
Ah charming Fair, said I,
How long can you my bliss deny?
By nature and by Love this lovely shade
Was for revenge of suffering Lovers made
Silence and shades with Love agree.
Both shelter you and favor me:
You cannot blush, because I cannot see.
4.
No, let me die, she said,
Rather than lose the spotless name of Maid.
Faintly methought she spoke; for all the while
She bid me not believe her, with a smile.
Then die, said I: She still denied,
And yet, Thus, thus she cried,
You use a harmless Maid, and so she died.
5.
I waked, and straight I knew
I loved so well, it made my dream prove true.
Fancy the kinder Mistress of the two.
I fancy I had done what Phillis would not do*
Ah cruel Nymph, cease your disdain,
Whilst I can dream you scorn in vain,
Asleep or waking, I must ease my pain.
The disconsolate Lover.
1.
AS I lay all alone on my ^ed slumbring,
Thinking my restless soul to repose,
All my thoughts they began then to be numbering
Up her disdainings, the cause of my woes;
That so encreast my dolor and pain,
I fear I never shall see her again:
Which makes me sigh, and sobbing cry,
O my Love, O my Love, for thee I die.
2.
When this fair cruel She I first saw praying
Within the Temple unto her Saint,
Then mine eyes every look my heart betraying,
Which is the cause of my doleful complaint,
That all my joys are quite sled and gone:
And I in sorrow am now lef^ alone:
Which makes me sigh, and sobbing cry,
O my Love, O my Love, for thee I die.
3.
Then farew^l every thing that sounds like pleasure,
And welcome Death the cure of my sma^t.
I deemed first sight of her, I grasped a treasure;
But woe is me, it has broken my heart:
For now my Passing Bell calls away,
And I with her no longer must stay:
Which makes me sigh, and sobbing cry,
O my Love, O my Love, for thee I die.
The subtle and coy Girl. The Tune, Silvia tell me how long it will be.
1.
WHy should my Celia now be coy,
In denying to yield me those Graces
Which we did formerly both enjoy
In our amorous mutual embraces?
She Will not give me a reason,
But shows me a frown
Is enough to destroy a poor Lover.
Ah Celia, once I did think thee mine own,
But now I my folly discover.
2.
Is it because I have been so kind
At all times to feed thy desire
In Presents and Treats, thou have changed thy mind,
And left me like Dun in the Mire?
Or else is it because thou do
Think my Estate
Is too mean to uphold thee in Brav'ry?
Know Celia, it is not so much out of date
To force me endure so much slavery.
3.
Or is it because thou will follow the mode,
Since most are addicted to changing,
Thou Would only get thee a name abroad,
I being more famous for ranging.
Nay Celia, more this truth thou woo'^ ^ind,
I therefore advise thee be wary,
When ever thou ge^st thee a Mate to thy mind,
He Will play thee the same fagary.
The Drawing of Valentines The tune, Madams Iig.
1.
THere was, and there was,
And I ma^^y was there,
A Crew on S. Valentines Eve did meet together,
And every Lad had his particular Lass there,
And drawing of Valentines caused their
Coming thither.
Then Mr. John drew Mrs. Ione f^^st, Sir.
And Mrs. Ione would fain a drawn John an' she
Durst, Sir.
So Mr. William drew Mrs. Gillian the next, Sir;
And Mrs. Gillian not drawing of William,
Was vex't, Sir,
2.
They then did jumble all in the ha^ together,
And each did promise them to draw 'em fair Sir:
But Mrs. Hester vowed that she had rather
Draw Mr. Kester then any that was there Sir:
So Mr. Kester drew with Mrs. Hester then Sir:
And Mrs. Hester drew Mr. Kester again Sir:
And Mr. Harry drew Mrs. Mary featly,
And Mrs. Mary did draw Mr. Harry as neatly.
3.
They all together then resolved to draw Sir,
And every one desired to draw their Friend Sir;
But Mr. Richard did keep 'em so in aw Sir,
And told 'em then they never should make an end Sir,
So Mr. Richard drew Mrs. Bridget squarely,
And Mrs. Bridget drew Mr. Richard as fairly:
But Mr. Hugh drew Mrs. Su but slily,
And Mrs. Su did draw Mr. Hugh as wily.
4.
Thus have you heard of the twelve that lately drew Sir:
How every one would fain their Friend have drawn
And now there is left to draw but four o'^h crew Sir,
And each did promise his Lass an ell of Lawn Sir.
So Mr. Watty drew Mrs. Katy but slightly,
And Mrs. Katy did draw Mr. Watty as lightly:
But Mr. Thomas in drawing of Annis too fast Sir.
Made Mrs. Annis to draw Mr. Thomas at last Sir.
5.
And there is an and, and an and, and an end of my Song, Sir,
Of Ionne and Iony, and William and Gillian too Sir,
To Kester and Hester, and Harry and Mary belong Sir,
Both Richard and Bridget, and Hugh, and honest Sue, Sir,
But Watty and Katy, and Thomas and Annis here, Sir.
Are the only four that now do bring up the Rear Sir:
Then every one i'^h' Tavern cry amain Sir,
And staid till drawing there had filled their brain, Sir.
A late and true story of a furious Scold, served in her kind. The tune, Step
stately.
1.
WAs ever man so vexed with a Trull,
As I poor Anthony since I was wed,
For I never can get my belly full,
But be^o^e I have supped, I must hasten to bed:
Or else she will begin to scold and to brawl,
And to call me Puppy and Cuckold and all
Yet she with her Cromes must trole it about,
Whilst I in my Kennel must snore it out.
2.
I once did g^ to drink with a Friend,
But she in a trice did fetch me away:
We both but two pence a piece did spend,
Yet it proved to me Execution day;
For she flew in my face, and called me fool,
And combed my head with a three-legg'd stool:
Nay, she furnished my face with so many scratches.
That for a whole month 'twas covered with patches
3.
Whatever money I get in the day,
To keep her in quiet I give her at night,
Or else shall license her tongue to play
For two or three hours just like a spright.
Then to the Cupbord Pilga^lick must hie,
To seek for some Crusts that have long lain dry:
So I steep 'um in ^kim-milk until they are wet,
And commonly this is the Supper I get.
4.
And once a month, for fashion sake,
She gives me leave to come to her bed;
But most that time I must lie awake,
Left she in her fits should knock me o'th'hea^.
But for the Bed I do lie on my self,
You Would think '^were as soft as an Oaken shelf;
For the Tick it is made of Hempen-hurds:
And yet for all this I must give her good words.
5.
We commonly both do piss in a Pan,
But the Cullender once was set in the place:
She then did take it up in her hand,
And floune't it out on my stomach and face.
I told her then she urin'd beside,
But she cay'd me Rogue, and told me I lied,
And swore it was not up to her thumb,
Then threw she the pan in the middle of the room.
6.
Then a Maid that was my Sweet heart before
Did come to the house to borrow a Pail:
I kissed her but once, and I thought on'^ no more,
But she flew in her face with tooth and nail:
But the Wench she stood to her, and clawed her about,
That for a whole fortnight she never stirred out;
For her eyes were so swelled, and her face was so ^ore
That I never saw Jade so mangled before.
7.
She then did bid me drop in her eyes
A Sovereign Water sent her that day,
But I had a Liquor I more did prize,
Made of Henbane and Mercury s^eep'd in Whey:
I dropped it in and nointed her fa^e,
Which br^ught her into a most Devilish case:
For she ^ore and she ranted, and well she might;
For after that time she (...) had sight.
8.
I then did get her a Dog and a Bell,
To lead her about from place to place:
And now it is, Husband, I hope you are well;
But before it was Cucko^d and Rogue to my face;
Then blessed be that Henbane and Mercury strong,
That made such a change in my wives tongue.
You see it is a Medicine certain and sure,
For the cure of a Scold, but I Will say no more.
A Song on the Declensions. The tune is, Shackle de hay.
MY Mistress she is fully known
To all the five declensions,
She Will seize 'em singly one by one,
To take their true Dimensions.
She never declined yet any man,
Yet they will decline her now and then,
In spite of her Inventions.
2.
First Musa is her Mothers name,
And haec does still attend her:
She is a hujus burley Dame,
Though huic be but slender:
Yet she will have a hanc on every man,
And hac him to do what he can,
Unless they do befriend her.
3.
Magister was her Father too,
And hic is still his man Sir,
Nay si^ius is her Son also,
And Dominus her Grandsire:
Nay Lucus, Agnus, and that Lamb-like crew,
She Will call 'em hunc's, I and hoc^s 'em too,
Do all that ever they can Sir.
4.
Next she is to lapis very kind,
As honest hic has sed Sir;
For she is to precious stones inclined
Full long before she was wed Sir*
Which made her Parents often say,
That hic and haec both night and day,
Was forced to watch her bed Sir.
5.
She beat poor manus with a Cane,
Though he did often hand her
From Whetstones-Park to Parkers-Lane,
And was her constant Pandor.
Yet give him man^ busses when
That she could get no other men,
That he could not withstand her.
6.
'Bout noon she would with Meridies dine,
And sup, and bed him too Sir:
She Would make poor facies to her incline,
In spite of all he could do Sir.
She day by day would dies pledge,
Which set poor acies teeth an edge,
And often made him spew Sir,
7.
Thus have I showed her Kindred here,
And all her dear Relations,
As Musa, Lapis, Magister,
And all their antic fashions.
Meridies, Manus, and Felix too
Are happy that they never knew
Any of all her station^.
A Song of the three degrees of comparison. The tune, And it is the Knave of
Clubs ^ears all the sway.
MY Mistress she loves Digni^ies,
For she has taken three degrees:
There Is no comparison can be made
With her in all her subtle Trade.
She Is positively known a Whore,
And superlatively runs on score.
2.
And first I Positive her call,
'Cause she will be absolute in all:
For she is to du^us very hard,
And with sad tristis often jan'd:
Which happily made Felix say*
Sweet dulcis carried all away.
3.
Next she is called Comparative,
For she will compare to any alive,
For scolding, whoring, and the rest:
Of the Illiberal Sciences in her breast:
She Will drink more hard than durlor.
Though he would harder drink before.
4.
Then she is called Superlative;
'Cause she will her Pedigree derive,
Not from Potens or Potentior,
The Mighty, or the Mightier:
But from Potentissimus,
Not bonus, melior, but Optimus.
5.
Thus have I showed my Mistress to ye,
And gradually in each degree:
How show is Positive to some,
Comparative when others come,
Superlative even over all,
Yet underneath her self will fall.
The kind Husband, but imperious Wife. The first part of the Tune his, and the
latter part hers.
M. 1.
WIfe, prithee come give me thy hand now,
And sit thee down by me:
There Is never a man in the Land now
Shall be more loving to thee.

W. 2.
I hate to sit by such a Drone,
Thou li^st like a Hog in my Bed:
I had better a lain alone,
For I still have my Maidenhead.

M. 3.
Wife, what would thou have me to do now,
I think I have played the man:
But if I were ruled by you now,
You Would have me do more than I can.

W. 4.
I make you do more than you can?
You lie like a Fool God wot:
When I thought to have found thee a man.
I found thee a fumbling Sot.

M. 5.
Wife, prithee now leave off thy ranting,
And let us both agree;
There Is nothing else shall be wanting,
If thou will be ruled by me.

W. 6.
I will have a Coach and a man:
And a Saddle Horse to ride;
I also will have a Sedan,
And a Footman to run by my side.

M. 7.
Thou shall have all this, my dear wife,
And thou shall bear the sway,
And I Will provide thee good cheer, wife,
Against thou come from the Park or a Play:

W. 8.
I Will have every month a new Gown,
And a Peticoat died in grain,
Of the modishest Silk in the Town,
And a Page to hold up my Train.

M. 9.
Thou shall have this too, my sweet wife,
If thou would contented be,
Or any thing else that is meet wife,
So that we may but agree.

W. 10.
I will have a Gallant or two,
And they shall be handsome men:
And I Will make you to know your Cue,
When they come in and go out again.

M. 11.
Methinks a couple's to few, wife,
Thou shall have three or four,
And yet I know thou would be true, wife,
Although thou had half a score.

W. 12.
I will have as many as I please,
In spite of your teeth, you fool,
And when I Have the Pocky Disease,
It Is thou shall empty my stool.

M. 13.
Why how now you brazen-faced Harlot,
I Will make you to change your note,
And if ever I find you snarl at
My actions, I Will bang your Coat.
14.
Nay, I Will make you to wait, you Flaps,
At Table till I have dined,
And I Will leave you nothing but scraps,
Until I do find you more kind.

W. 15.
Sweet Husband, I now cry Peccavi,
You know we women are frail;
And for the ill words that I gave ye,
Ask pardon, and hope to prevail.
For now I will lie at your foot.
Desiring to kiss your hand:
Nay, cast off my Gallants to boot,
And still be at your commnad.

A Song at the Dukes House.
1.
MAke ready, fair Lady, to night,
And stand at the door below:
For I will be there to receive you with care,
And to your true love you shall go.
2.
And when the Stars twinkle so bright,
Then down to the door will I creep,
To my Love will I fly, ere the Jealous can spy,
And leave my old Daddy asleep.
A Song at the Kings House.
1.
TO little or no purpose have I spent all my days
In ranging the Park the Exchange, and the Plays,
Yet never in my Ramble till now did I prove
So happy, to meet with the man I could love.
But O how I Am pleased when I think of the man
That I find I must love, let me do what I can!
2.
How long I shall love him, I can no more tell,
Than had I a Fever, when I should be well:
My Passion shall kill me before I will show it,
And yet I would give all the world he did know it,
But, O how I sigh, when I think, should ^e woo me,
That I cannot deny what I know will undo me!
A Song, The Tune, Robin Rowser.
MY Name is honest Harry,
And I love little Mary:
In spite of Cis, or jealous Bess,
I Will have my own vagary.
2.
My Love is blithe and bucksome,
And sweet and fine as can be:
Fresh and gay as the flowers in May,
And looks like Iackadandy.
3.
And if she will not have me,
That am so true a Lover,
I Will drink my Wine, and never repine,
And down the stairs I Will shove her.
4.
But if that she will love,
I Will be as kind as may be;
I Will give her Rings and pretty things,
And deck her like a Lady.
5.
Her Peticoat of Satin,
Her Gown of Crimson Taby,
Laced up before and spangled over,
Just like a Bartlemew Baby.
6.
Her Wastcoat is of Scarlet,
With Ribbons tied together,
Her Stockins of a bow-dy'd hue,
And her Shoes of Spanish Leather.
7.
Her Smock of the ^inest Holland,
And laced in every quarter:
Side and wide, and long enough,
And hangs below her garter.
8.
Then to the Church I Will have her,
Where we will wed together:
So come home when we have done,
In spite of wind and weather:
9.
The Fiddlers shall attend us,
And first play, John come kiss me;
And when that we have danced a round,
They shall play, Hit or miss me.
10.
Then hey for little Mary,
It Is she I love alone Sir:
Let any man do what he can,
I will have her or none Sir.
These following are to be understood two ways.
I Saw a Peacock, with a fiery tail
I saw a blazing Comet, drop down hail
I saw a Cloud, with Ivy circled round
I saw a sturdy Oak, creep on the ground
I saw a Pismire, swallow up a Whale
I saw a raging Sea, brim full of Ale
I saw a Venice Glass, sixteen foot deep
I saw a Well, full of men's tears that weep
I saw their Eyes, all in a flame of fire
I saw a House, as big as the Moon and higher
I saw the Sun, even in the midst of night
I saw the Man that saw this wondrous sight.
On the Sea-sight with the Hollanders in the R^mps time.
MY wishes greet the Navy of the Dutch,
The English Fleet I all good fortune grutch,
May no storm toss Van Trump and his Sea-Forces,
The Harp and Cross shall have my daily curses,
Smile gentle Fates on the Dutch Admiral,
Upon our States the Plagues of Egypt fall;
Attend all health the Cavaliering part,
This Commonwealth I value not a fart.
Thus I my wishes and my prayers divide
Between the Rebels and the Regicide:
Backwards and forwards thus I break my mind,
And hope the Fates at last will be so kind,
That the old Proverb may but wheel about,
True men might have their own, now Knaves fall out.
The Answer to Ask me no more whither does stray.
1.
I WILL tell you true whither does stray
The darkness which succeeds the day;
For Heavens vengeance did allow
It still should frown upon your Brow.
2.
I Will tell you true where may be found
A voice that is like the Screech-Owls found:
For in your false deriding throat
It lies, and death is in its note.
3.
I Will tell you true whither does pass
The smiling look seen in the glass,
For in your face't reflects and there
False as your shadow does appear.
4.
I Will tell you true whither are blown
The angry wheels of Thistle-down:
It flies into your mind, whose care
Is to be light as Thistles are.
5.
I Will tell you true within what Nest
The Cuckoo lays her eggs to rest;
It is your Bosom, which can keep
Nor him nor them: Farewell, I Will sleep.
A Dialogue between William and Harry Riding on the Way.
H. 1.
NOble, lovely, virtuous Creature,
Purposely so framed by nature,
To inthral your servants wits.

W. 2.
Time must now unite our hearts,
Not for any my deserts,
But because methinks it fits.

H. 3.
Dearest treasure of my thought,
And yet were thou to be bought,
With my life, tho^ were not dear.

W. 4.
Secret comfort of my mind,
Doubt no longer to be kind,
But be so, and so appear.

H. 5.
Give me love for love again,
Let our loves be clear and plain,
Heaven is fairest, when it is clearest.

W. 6.
Lest in clouds and in deserring,
We resemble Seamen erring,
Farthest off when we are nearest.

H. 7.
Thus with numbers interchanged,
William's Muse and mine have ranged,
Verse and Journey both are spent.

W. 8.
And if Harry chance to say,
That we well have spent the day,
I for my part am content.

A Gentleman on his beautiful Mistress.
1.
YOu meaner Beauties of the night,
That poorly satisfy our eyes
More by your number than your light,
You common people of the skies,
What are you when the Sun shall rise?
2.
You curious Chanters of the Wood,
That warble forth Dame Natures Lays,
Thinking your voices understood
By their weak accents, What Is your praise
When Philomel her voice shall raise?
3.
You Violets that first appear,
By your purple Mantles known,
Like the proud Virgins of the year,
As if the Spring were all your own,
What are you when the Rose is blown?
4.
So when my Mistress shall be seen
In form and beauty of her mind,
She cannot less be than a Queen;
And I believe she was designed
TO eclipse the Glory of her kind.
A Description of the Spring.
ANd now all Nature seemed in love,
The lusty Sun began to move:
Now Juice did stir the embracing Vines,
And Birds had drawn their Valentines;
The jealous Trout that low did lie,
Rose at a well-dissembled Fly;
Then stood my Friend with Patient skill,
Attending of his trembling Quill.
Already were the Eaves possessed
With the swift Pilgrims dawbed Nest;
The Groves already did rejoice,
In Philomel's triumphing voice;
The Showrs were short, the Weather mild,
The Morning fresh, the Evening smiled:
Ione takes her neat rubbed Pail, and now
She trips to meet the Sand-red Cow,
Where for some sturdy Football Swain
Ione strokes a Syllabub or twain:
The Fields and Gardens were beset
With Tulip, Crocus, Violet:
And now, though late, the modest Rose
Did more than half a blush disclose:
Thus all looked gay, all full of cheer,
To welcome this new liv'ried Year.
On a Shepherd losing his Mistress. Tune, Amongst the Myrtles as I walked.
1.
STay Shepherd, prithee Shepherd stay:
Did thou not see her run this way?
Where may she be, can thou not guess?
Alas! I Have lost my Shepherdess.
2.
I fear some Satyr has betrayed
My pretty Lamb unto the shade:
Then woe is me, for I Am undone,
For in the shade she was my Sun.
3.
In Summer heat were she not seen,
No solitary Vale was green:
The blooming Hills, the downy Meads,
Bear not a Flower but where she treads.
4.
Hushed were the senseless Trees when she
Sat but to keep them company:
The silver streams were swelled with pride,
When she sat singing by their side.
5.
The Pink, the Cowslip, and the Rose
Strive to salute her where she goes;
And then contend to kiss her Shoo,
The Pancy and the Daizy too.
6.
But now I wander on the Plains,
Forsake my home, and Fellow-Swains,
And must for want of her, I see,
Resolve to die in misery.
7.
For when I think to find my Love
Within the bosom of a Grove,
Methinks the Grove bids me forbear,
And sighing says, She is not here.
8.
Next do I fly unto the Woods,
Where Flora pranks her self with Buds,
Thinking to find her there: But lo!
The Myrtles and the Shrubs say, No.
9.
Then what shall I unhappy do,
Or whom shall I complain unto?
No, no, here I Am resolved to die,
Welcome sweet Death and Destiny.
The Soldiers Resolution.
HEre stands the man that for his Countries good
Has with courageous Arms in sweat and blood
Ran through an Host of Pikes: He, he I was
Out-dar'd the Thunder of the roaring Brass,
Kicked my black Stars, spurned Balls of fire with sco^
Like to a Football in a frosty morn;
Made Death to tremble, and have bid my Drum
Beat a Defiance to the Cowardly scum.
And shall I now like a Pedantick stand,
Scraping and crouching with my Cap in hand
To base-born Peasants? No, he is but a Worm
That strikes his Top-sail to a little Storm.
Here then I Will fix, that nothing shall control
The Resolutions of a Gallant Soul.
On the Golden Cross in Cheapside.
TWo Fellows gazing at the Cross in Cheap,
Says one, Methinks it is the rarest heap
Of Stone that e're was built; it ought, I see,
One of the Wonders of the World to be,
No, says the other, and began to swear,
The Crosses of the World no Wonders are.
On a Pretender to Gentility, suspected to be a Highway-man.
A Great Pretender to Gentility,
Came to a Herald for his Pedigree:
Beginning there to swagger, roar, and swear,
Required to know what Arms he was to beat:
The Herald knowing what he was, begun
To rumble o'r his Heraldry; which done,
Told him he was a Gentleman of note,
And that he had a very glorious Coat.
Prithee, what is it? quoth he, and here is your fees.
Sir, says the Herald, it is two Rampant Trees,
One Couchant; add to give it further scope,
A Ladder Passant, and a Pendant Rope:
And for a grace unto your Blue-coat Sleeves,
There is a Bird in the Crest that strangles Thieves.
A Song.
1.
A Blithe and bonny Country Lass
Sat sighing on the tender Grass,
And weeping said, will none come woo her?
A dapper Boy, a lither Swain,
That had a mind her love to gain,
With smiling looks straight came unto her.
2.
When as the wanton Girl espied
The means to make her self a Bride,
She simper'd much like bonny Nell.
The Swa^n that saw her very kind,
H^s Arms about her body twined,
And said, Fair Lass, how fare ye, well?
3.
The Country Lass said, Well forsooth,
But that I have a longing tooth,
A longing tooth, that makes me cry.
Alas, says he, what ga^s thy grief?
A wound, says she, without relief,
I fear that I a Maid shall die.
4.
If that be all, the Shepherd said,
I Will make thee Wive it, gentle Maid,
And so ^ecure thy Malady:
On which they kissed, with many an O^th,
And 'sore God Pan did plight their Troth;
So to the Church away they hie.
5.
And Jove send every pretty Peat,
That fears to die of this conceit,
So kind a Friend to help at last:
Then Maids shall never long again,
When they find ease for such a pain:
And thus my Roundelay is past.
A Song on Love.
1.
IF Love be Life, I long to die;
Live they that list for me,
And he that gains the most thereby.
A fool at least shall be.
But he that feels the forest fits,
Scapes with no less than loss of wits.
Unhappy life they gain, which Love do entertain.
2.
In day by feigned Looks they live,
By lying Dreams in night:
Each ^rown a deadly wound does give,
Each smile a false delight.
If It hap their Lady pleasant seem,
It is for others love they deem:
If void she seem of joy, disdain does make her coy.
4.
Such is the peace that Lovers find,
Such is the Life they lead,
Blown here and there with every wind,
Like Flowers in the Mead.
Now war, now peace, then war again,
Desire, despair, delight, disdain,
Though dead, in midst of life; in peace, and yet at strife.
A Song.
I Serve Amynta whiter than the snow,
Streighter than Cedar, brighter than the Glass,
More sine in trip than foot of running Roe,
More pleasant than the Field of flow'ring Grass;
More gladsom to my withering joys that fade,
Than Winters Sun, or Summers cooling Shade.
2.
Sweeter than swelling Grape of ripest Vine,
Softer than feathers of the fairest swan,
Smoother than Jet, more stately than the Pine,
Fresher than Poplar, smaller than my span,
Clear^r than Phoebus fiery pointed Beam,
Or Icy Crust of Crystals frozen streams.
3.
Yet is she curster than the Bear by kind,
And harder-hearted than the aged Oak:
More glib than Oil, more sickle than the Wind,
More stiff than steel, no sooner bent but broke.
Lo thus my service is a lasting sore;
Yet will I serve, although I die therefore.
The Description of Love, in a Dialogue between two Shepherds, Will and Tom.
Tom. 1.
SHepherd, what is Love, I prithee tell?

Will. It is that fountain and that Well
Where Pleasure and Repeutance dwell:
It is perhaps that fauncing Bell
That toles All-in to Heaven or Hell,
And this is Love, as I heard tell.

T. 2.
Yet what is Love, I prithee say?

W. It is a work on Holy Day:
It is December matched with May,
When lusty Bloods in fresh array,
Hearten months after of their play;
And this is Love, as I hear say.

T. 3.
Yet what is Love, I pray be plain?

W. It is a Sunshine mixed with Rain;
It is a Toothache, or worse pain;
It is a Game, where none does gain,
It is a thing turmoils the brain:
And this is Love, as I hear sayen.

T. 4.
Yet Shepherd, what is Love, I pray?

W. It is a yea, it is a nay,
A pretty kind of sporting fray;
It is a thing will soon away,
For 'twill not long with any stay:
And this is Love, as I hear say.

T. 5.
Yet what is Love, good Shepherd show?

W. A thing that creeps, it cannot go;
A prize that passes to and fro,
A thing for one, a thing for more,
And he that loves shall find it so:
And Shepherd, this is Love, I trow.

A Song called Loves Lottery. At the Dukes House.
RUn to Loves Lottery, run Maids, and rejoice,
Whilst seeking your chance, you meet you own Choice,
And boast that your luck you helped with design,
By praying cross-legg'd to S. Valentine.
Hark, hark, a Prize is drawn, and Trumpets sound
Tanta, ra, ra, Tanta, ra, ra, Tanta, ra, ra.
Hark Maids, more Lots are drawn, Prizes abound;
Dub a dub, the Drum now beats,
And dub, a dub, a dub, Echo repeats,
As if the God of War had made
Loves Queen a Skirmish for a Serenade.
Haste, haste, fair Maids, and come away,
The Priest attends, the Bridegrooms stay:
Roses and Pinks will we strew where you go,
Whilst I walk in Shades of Willow.
When I am dead, let him that did slay me
Be but so kind, so gentle to lay me
There where neglected Lovers mourn,
Where Lamps and hallowed Tapers burn,
Where Clerks in Quires sad Dirges sing,
Where sweetly Bells at Burials ring.
On a Gentleman. Tune, My Freedom, which is all my Joy.
2.
POor Clori^ wept, and from her eyes
The liquid tears came trickling down;
Such wealthy drops may well suffice,
To be the ransom of a Crown:
And as she wept, she sighed, and said,
Alas for me unhappy Maid,
That by my folly, my folly am betrayed.
2.
When first these eyes, unhappy eyes,
Met with the Author of my woe,
Methoughts our Souls did sympathize,
And it was death to say him no.
He su'd, I granted; O then befell
My shame, which I Am afraid to tell!
Ay me that I had never loved so well.
3.
O had I been so wise as not
To Have yielded up my Virgin-Fort,
My life had been without a blot,
And dared the envy of Report;
But now my guilt has made me be
A scorn for time to point at me,
As at the But and Mark of Misery.
4.
Here now in sorrow do I sit,
And pensive thoughts possess my breast!
My silly heart with cares is split,
And grief denies me wonted rest:
Come then black night and screen me round,
That I may never more be found,
Unless in tears, in tears of sorrow drowned.
On Men escaped drowning in a Tempest.
1.
ROcks, Shelves, and Sands, and all farewell:
Fie, who would dwell in such a Hell
As is a Ship; which drunk does reel,
Taking salt Healths from Deck to Keel.
2.
Up we are swallowed in wet graves,
All sous'd in Waves, by Neptune's Slaves:
What shall we do, being tossed to Shore,
Milk some blind Tavern, and there roar?
3.
It Is brave, my Boys, to sail on Land;
For being well manned, we can cry, Stand:
The Trade of pursing never shall fail,
Until the Hangman cries, Strike Sail.
On a great Heat in Egypt.
I Formerly in Countries often have been
Under the AEquinoctial, where I Have seen
The Sun disperse such a prodigious Heat,
That made our Sieve-like Skins to rain with Sweat:
Men would have given for an Eclipse their lives.
Or one whisper of Air: yet each man strives
To throw up grass, feathers, nay, women ^oo,
To find the Wind: all falls like Lead, none blew.
The Dog Star spits new fires, till't come to pass,
Each man became his neighbors Burning glass:
Lean men did turn to ashes presently,
Fat men did roast to lean anatomy:
Young women's hea^ did get themselves with child
For none but they themselves, themselves defiled.
Old women naturally to Witches turned,
And only rubbing one another, burned:
The Beasts were baked, skin turned to crust they say,
And fishes in the River boiled away:
Birds in the air were roasted, and not burned;
For as they fell down, all the way they turned.
On a mighty Rain.
HEaven did not weep, but in its swelling eye
Whole seas of Rheum and moist Catarhs did lie,
Which so bespawl'd the lower world, men see
Corn blasted, and the fruit of every Tree:
Air was condensed to water, against their wish,
And all their Fowl were turned to flying Fish:
Like Watermen they thronged to ply a Fare,
And thought it had been navigable air:
Beasts lost their natural motion of each limb;
Forgot to go, with practicing to swim.
A Trout now here, you would not think how soon
Taken ready dressed forth' Empress of the Moon:
The fixed Stars, though to our eyes were missing,
We knew yet were, by their continual hissing.
Women seemed Maremaids, sailing with the wind,
The greatest miracle was Fish behind:
But men are all kept short against their wish,
And could commit but the cold sin of Fish.
The blunt Lover.
MAdam, I cannot court your sprightly eyes
With a Base-Viol placed betwixt my thighs:
I cannot lisp, nor to the Guittar sing,
And tire my brains with simple Sonnetting,
I am not fashioned for these amorous times,
And cannot court you in lascivious Rhimes:
Nor can I whine in puling Elegies,
And at your feet lie begging from your eyes
A gracious look: I cannot dance nor caper,
Nor dally, swear, protest, lie, rant, and vaper,
I cannot kiss your hand, play with your hair,
And tell you that you only are most fair:
I cannot cross my arms, nor cry, Ay me
Poor forlorn man! All this is foppery.
Nor can I Masquerade, as the fashion's now,
No, no, My heart to these can never bow:
But what I can do, I shall tell you roundly,
Hark in your ear; By Jove I Will kiss you soundly.
On a Watch lost in a Tavern.
A Watch lost in a Tavern! That Is a Crime;
Then see how men by drinking lose their time.
The Watch kept Time; and if Time will away,
I see no reason why the Watch should stay.
You say the Key hung out, and you forgot to lock it,
Time will not be kept prisoner in a Pocket.
Henceforth if you will keep your Watch, this do,
Pocket your Watch, and watch your Pocket too.
A Song, with the Latin to it.
WHen as the Nightingale chanted her Vesper,
And the wild Forresters couched on the ground,
Venus invited me in the Evenings whisper
Unto a fragrant Field with Roses crowned,
Where she before had sent her wishes complement,
Which to her hearts content played with me on the Green:
Never Mark Anthony dallied more wantonly
With the fair Egyptian Queen.
The Latin.
CAntu Luscinia somnum ^rritat,
Salvi vagi sunt in Cubilibus:
Hoc me silentio Venus invitat,
Ad viridarium fragrantius;
Vbi promiserat, qui mentem flexerat
Gaudia temperat sic mihi solida.
O non dux Amasius lusit beatius
Cum Regina Nilotica.
De Vino and Venere.
DOte neither on Women, nor on Wine,
For to thy hurt they both alike incline:
Venus thy strength, and Bacchus with his sweet
And pleasant Grape debilitates the feet.
Blind Love will blab what he in secret did,
In giddy Wine there is nothing can be hid.
Seditious wars often Cupid has begun,
Raechus to arms makes men in fury run:
Venus (unjust) by horrid war lost Troy;
Bacchus by war the Lapiths did destroy.
When thou with both or either are possessed,
Shame, honesty, and fear often flies thy breast:
In fetters Venus keep, in gyves Bacchus tie,
Lest by their free gifts they thee damnifie.
Use Wine for thirst, Venus for lawful Seed;
To pass these limits, may thy danger breed.
On Wine.
HE that with Wine, Wine thinks t'expel,
One ill would with another quell:
A Trumpet, with a Trumpet drown:
Or with the Crier of the Town
Still a loud man: Noise deaf with noise,
Or to convert a Bawd, make choice
Of a Pander: Pride with pride shame thus,
Or put a Cook down by Calistratus;
Discord by discord think to case,
Or any man with scoffs appease:
So War by Battle to restrain,
And labor mitigate by pain:
Command a sudden peace between
Two shrill Scolds in the height of spleen:
By Drink to queneh Drink is all one,
As is by strife, strife to atone.
A Song called Hide-Park. The tune,
Honor invites you to delights,
Come to the Court, and be all made Knights.
1.
COme all you noble, you that are neat ones,
Hide-Park is now both fresh and green:
Come all you Gallants that are great ones,
And are desirous to be seen:
Would you a Wife or Mistress rare,
Here are the best of England fair:
Here you may choose, also refuse,
As you your judgments ple^se to use.
2.
Come all you Courtiers in your neat fashions,
Rich in your new unpaid-for silk:
Come you brave Wenches, and court your stations,
Here in the bushes the Maids do milk:
Come then and revel, the Spring invites
Beauty and youth for your delights,
All that are fair, all that are rare,
You shall have license to compare.
3.
Here the great Ladies all of the Land are,
Drawn with six Horses at the least:
Here are all that of the Strand are,
And to be seen now at the best.
Westminster Hall, who is of the Court,
Unto his place does now all resort:
Both high and low here you may know,
And all do come themselves to show.
4.
The Merchants wives that keep their Coaches,
Here in the Park do take the air;
They go abroad to avoid reproaches,
And hold themselves as Ladies fair:
For whilst their Husbands gone are to trade
Unto their ships by Sea or Land:
Who will not say, why may not they
Trade, like their own Husbands, in their own way.
5.
Here from the Country come the Girls flying
For husbands, though of parts little worth:
They at the Exchange have been buying
The last new fashion that came forth:
And are desirous to have it seen,
As if before it never had been:
So you may see all that may be
Had in the Town or Country.
6.
Here come the Girls of the rich City.
Aldermens daughters fair and proud,
Their Jealous Mothers come to invite ye,
For fear they should be losti'th' crowd:
Who for their breeding are taught to dance,
Their birth and fortune to advance:
And they will be as frolic and free,
As you your self expect to see.
To his coy Mistress.
1.
COy one, I say, Be gone,
My love-days now are done:
Were thy Brow like Ivory free,
Yet it is more black than Jet to me.
2.
Might thy hairy Tress compare
With Daphne's sporting with the air,
As it is worse fettered far
Than the knotty tuffs of Mandrakes are.
3.
Were there in thy squint eyes found
True native sparks of Diamond;
As they are duller sure I am,
Than the Eye-Lamps of a dying man,
4.
Were thy breath a Civet scent,
Or some purer Element;
As there is none profess thee love,
Can touch thy lips without a Glove.
5.
Were thy Nose of such a shape,
As Nature could no better make;
As it is so skrewed in,
It claims acquaintance with thy Chin.
6.
Were thy Breasts two rising Mounts,
Those Ruby Nipples milky Founts,
As these two so fairly move,
They Would make a Lover freeze for love.
7.
Could thy pulse affection beat,
Thy Palm a balmy moisture sweat;
As their active vigor's gone,
Dry and cold as any stone.
8.
Were thy arms, legs, feet, and all,
That we with modesty can call;
Nay, were they all of such a grace,
As't might be styled, Love amorous place.
9.
As all these yield such weak delight,
They Would fright a Bridegroom the first night:
And hold it a curse for to be sped
Of such a fury in his bed.
10.
Could thine high improved state,
Vye with the greatest Potentate:
As in all their store I find
Mole-hills to a noble mind.
11.
Were thou as rich in Beauties form,
As thou are held in Natures scorn:
I vow these should be none of mine,
Because they are entitled thine.
A Dialogue concerning Hair, between A Man and a Woman.
M. 1.
ASk me no more why I do wear
My Hair so far below my ear:
For the first Man that e're was made
Did never know the Barbers Trade,

W. 2.
Ask me no more where all the day
The foolish Owl does make her stay:
It Is in your Locks; for tak'^ from me,
She thinks your hair an Ivy-tree.

M. 3.
Tell me no more that length of hair
Can make the visage seem less fair;
For howsoe'r my hair does sit,
I Am sure that yours comes short of it.

W. 4.
Tell me no more men were long hair
To chase away the colder air;
For by experience we may see
Long hair will but a back friend be.

M. 5.
Tell me no more that long hair can
Argue deboistness in a man;
For it is Religious being inclined,
To save the Temples from the wind.

W. 6.
Ask me no more why Roarers wear
Their hair ex^ant below their ear;
For having morgag'd all their Land,
They Would fain oblige the appearing Band.

M. 7.
Ask me no more why hair may be
The expression of Gentility:
It Is that which being largely grown,
Derives its Gentry from the Crown.

W. 8.
Ask me no more why grass being grown,
With greedy Sickle is cut down,
Till short and sweet: So ends my Song,
Lest that long hair should grow too long.

A Song.
1.
THat Beauty I adored before,
I now as much despise:
It Is Money only makes the Whore:
She that for love with her Crony lies,
^ichaste: But that is the Whore that kisses for pr^^^.
2.
Let Jove with Gold his Danae woo,
It shall be no rule for me:
Nay, '^ may be I may do so too,
When I Am as old as he.
Till then I Will never bire the thing that is free^punc;
3.
If Coin must your Affection Imp,
Pray get some other Friend:
My Pocket never shall be my Pimp,
I never that intend,
Yet can be noble too, if I see they mend.
4.
Since Loving was a Liberal Art,
How can thou trade for gain?
The pleasure is on your part,
It Is we Men take the pain:
And being so, must Women have the gain?
5.
No, no, I Will never farm your Bed,
Nor your Smock-Tenant be:
I hate to rent your white and red,
You shall not let your Love to me:
I court a Mistress, not a Landlady.
6.
A Pox take him that first set up,
The Excise of Flesh and Skin:
And since it will no better be,
Let Us both to kiss begin;
To kiss freely; if not, you may go spin.
The Careless Swain.
1.
IS she gone? let her go; faith Boys, I care not,
I Will not sue after her, I dare not, I dare not.
Though she'as more Land than I by many an Acre,
I have plowed in her ground, who will may take her.
2.
She is a witty one, and she is fair too;
She must have all the Land that she is Heir too:
But as for Free Land she has not any,
For hers is Lammas ground, common to many.
3.
Were it in Several, '^were a great favor,
It might be an enriching to him that shall have her:
But hers is common ground, and without bounding,
You may graze in her ground, and fear no pounding.
A Catch for three Voices.
JAck, Will and Tom are ye come,
I think there is mirth in your faces:
How glad I Am to see such Lads all agree
In tunes and time, and graces.
A Song.
1.
CHloris, when I to thee present
The cause of all my discontent;
And show that all the wealth that can
Flow from this little world of man,
Is naught but Constancy and Love,
Why will you other objects prove?
2.
O do not cozen your desires
With common and mechanic fires:
That picture which you see in gold,
In every Shop is to be sold,
And Diamonds of richest prize
Men only value with their eyes.
3.
But look upon my loyal heart,
That knows to value every part:
And loves thy hidden virtue more
Than outward shape, which fools adore:
In that you will all the treasures find
That can content a noble mind.
The forsaken Maid, A Song.
1.
NOr Love, nor Fate dare I accuse,
For that my Love does me refuse:
But O mine own unworthiness,
That durst presume so great a bliss!
Too mickle 'twere for me to love
A man so like the Gods above,
With Angels face, and Saint-like voice,
It Is too Divine for Humane choice.
2.
But had I wisely given mine heart,
For to have loved him but in part:
As only to enjoy his face.
Or any one peculiar Grace;
A, foot, or hand, or lip, or eye:
Then had I lived where now I die.
But I presuming all to choose,
Am now condemned all to lose.
3.
You Rural Gods that guard the Swains,
And punish all unjust disdains;
O do not censure him for this,
It was my error, and not his.
This only boon of you I Will crave,
To fix these Lines upon my Grave:
Like Icarus, I soared too high,
For which offense I pine, I die.
On a Precise Tailor.
A Tailor, but a man of upright dealing,
True, but for lying; honest, but for stealing;
Did fall one day extremely sick by chance,
And on a sudden fell in a wondrous Trance:
The Friends of Hell must'ring in fearful manner,
Of sundry colored Silks displayed a Banner
Which he had stolen; and wished, as they did tell,
That he might one day find it all in Hell.
The man affrighted at this Apparition,
Upon Recovery grew a great Precisian;
He bought a Bible of the new Translation,
And in his Life he showed great Reformation:
He walked demurely, and he talked meekly,
He heard two Lectures, and two Sermons weekly:
He vowed to shun all Company unruly,
And in his speech he used no Oath but Truly:
And zealously to help the Sabbaths Rest,
The Meat for that day on the Eve was dressed:
And lest the custom that he had to steal,
Might cause him sometimes to forget his zeal,
He gives his Journey-man a special charge,
That if the Stuff allowed fell out to large,
And that to filch his fingers were inclined,
He then should put the Banner in his mind.
This done, I scarce can tell the rest for laughter,
A Captain of a Ship came three days after,
And bought three yards of Velvet and three quarters,
To make his Vest so large to hang below his garters,
He that precisely knew what was enough,
Soon slip^ away a quarter of the Stust:
His man espying it, said in derision,
Remember, Master, how you saw the Vision.
Peace, Fool, quoth he, I did not see one rag
Of such like colored Stuff within the Flag.
The Scotch Girls Complaint for an Englishmans going away, when my Lord Monk
came for England.
1.
ILl tide this cruel Peace that has gained a War on me,
I never fancied Laddy till I saw mine Enemy:
O methoughts he was the bl^^hest one
That e're I set mine eyes upon:
Well might have fooled a wiser one,
As he did me:
He looked so pretty, and talked so witty,
None could deny,
But needs must yield the Fort up,
Good faith, and so did I.
2.
Tantara went the Trumpets, and strait we were in Arms,
We dreaded no Invasions, Embrances were our Charms.
As we close to one another sit,
Did according to our Mothers wit,
But hardly now can smother it,
It will be known,
Alack and welly, sick back and belly,
Never was Maid,
A Soldier is a coming, though young,
Makes me afraid.
3.
To England bear this Sonnet, direct it unto none,
But to the brave Monk-Heroes, both sigh and singing moan:
Some there are perhaps will take my part,
At his bosom Cupid shake his dart,
That from me he never may part,
That is mine own:
O may thou never wear Bow and Quiver,
Till I may see
Once more the happy feature
Of my loved Enemy.
On Fairford curious Church-Windows, which escaped the War and the Puritan.
TEll me, you Anti-Saints, why Glass
To you is longer lived than Bras^;
And why the Saints have escaped their falls
Better on Windows than on VValls?
Is it because the Brothers fires
Maintain a Glass-house at Blackfriers?
Next, why the Church stands North and South,
And East and West the Preachers mouth?
Or is it because such painted ware
Resembles something what you are?
So pied, so seeming, so unsound
In Doctrine and in Manners found,
That out of Emblematick wit
You spare your selves in sparing it?
If it be so, then Fairford boast,
Thy Church has kept what all has lost:
It is preserved from the bane
Of either War or Puritan;
Whose Life is colored in thy Paint,
The inside Dross, but outside Saint.
The Soldiers praise of a Lowse.
1.
WIll you please to hear a new Ditty,
In praise of a six footed Creature:
She lives both in Country and City,
She Is woundrous loving by nature.
2.
She Will proffer her service to any,
She Will stick close but she will prevail:
She is entertained by many,
Till death no Master she will fail.
3.
Your rich men she cannot endure,
Nor can she your shifter abide:
But still she sticks close to the poor,
Though often they claw her hide.
4.
The nonsuited man she will woo him,
Or any good fellows that lack:
She will be as nigh a friend to him
As the shirt that sticks to his back.
5.
Your neat Landress she perfectly hates,
And those that do set her awork:
And still in foul Linen delights,
That she in the seams on it may lurk.
6.
Corruption she draws like a Horse-leech,
Being big, she grows a great breeder:
At night she goes home to her Cottage,
And in the day is a devilish feeder.
7.
To Commanders and Soldiers in purging
I Am sure her Receipts are good:
For she saves them the charge of a Surgeon
In sucking and letting of blood.
8.
She Will venture in a Battle as far
As any Commander that goes:
She Will play Jack a both sides in war,
And cares not a pin for her foes.
9.
She Is always shot-free in fight,
To kill her no Sword will prevail:
And if took Prisoner by flight,
She Is crushed to death with a Nail.
10.
From her and her breed Jove defend us
For her company we have had store:
Let her go to the Court and the Gentry,
And trouble poor Soldiers no more.
A Song.
S
M^thought the other night
I saw a pretty sight
That moved me much:
A fair and comely Maid
Not squeamish nor afraid
To let me touch.
Our lips most sweetly kissing
Each other never missing:
Her smiling look did show content,
That she did naught but what she meant.
2.
And as our lips did move,
The Echo still was Love,
Love, love me sweet.
Then with a Maiden blush,
Instead of crying Push,
Our lips did meet:
With Music sweet by sounding,
And Pleasures all abounding,
We kept the Burden of the Song,
Which was, That Love should take no wrong.
A Song.
1.
O My dearest, I shall grieve thee
When I swear, yet Sweet believe me.
By thine eye, that Crystal Book
In which all crabbed old men look,
I swear to thee, though none abhor them,
Yet I do not love thee for them.
2.
I do not love thee for that fair
Rich Fan of thy most curious Hair:
Though the wires thereof are drawn
Finer than the threads of Lawn,
And are softer than the sleeves
Which the subtle Spinner weaves.
3.
I do not love thee for those flowers
Growing on thy Cheeks, Loves Bowers;
Though such cunning them has spread,
None can part their white and red:
Loves golden Arrows there are shot,
Yet for them I love thee not.
4.
I do not love thee for those sof^
Red Coral Lips I Have kissed so often,
Nor teeth of Pearl, though double reared
To speech, where Music still is heard,
Though from thence a kiss being taken,
Would Tyrants melt, and death awaken.
5.
I do not love thee, O my Fairest,
For that richest, for that rarest
Silver Pillar which stands under
Thy lovely Head, that Glass of wonder:
Though thy Neck be whiter far
Than Towers of polished Ivory are.
6.
Nor do I love thee for those Mountains
Hid with Snow, whence Nectar Fountains
Sug'red sweet, and Syrup-berry,
Must one day run through Pipes of Cherry:
O how much those Breasts do move me^
Yet for these I do not love thee.
7.
I do not love thee for thy Palm,
Though the dew thereof be Balm:
Nor thy curious Leg and Foot,
Although it be a precious Root
Whereon this stately Cedar grows:
Sweet I love thee not for those.
8.
Nor for thy wit so pure and quick,
Whose substance no Arithmetic
Can number down: Nor for the charms
Thou make with embracing arms;
Though in them one night to lie,
Dearest I would gladly die.
9.
I love the not for eyes nor hair,
Nor lips, nor teeth that are so rare;
Nor for thy neck, nor for thy breasts,
Nor for thy belly, nor the rest:
Nor for thy hand, nor foot, nor small,
But would thou know, dear sweet, for all.
An old Song on the Spanish Armado.
2.
SOme years of late in eighty eight,
As I do well remember,
It was some say, nineteenth of May,
And some say in September,
And some say in September.
The Spanish train, lanch'd forth amain,
With many a fine bravado
Their (as they thought) but it proved not,
Invincible Armado,
Invincible Armado.
3.
There was a little man that dwelt in Spain,
Who shot well in a Gun a,
Don Pedro hight, as black a wight
As the Knight of the Sun a,
As the Knight of the Sun a.
4.
King Philip made him Admiral,
And bid him not to stay a
But to destroy, both man and boy,
And so to come away a,
And so to come away a.
5.
Their Navy was well victualled
With Biscuit, Pease, and Bacon,
They brought two Ships, well fraught with Whips,
But I think they were mistaken.
But I think they were mistaken.
6.
There men were young, Munition strong,
And to do us more harm a,
They thought it meet to join their Fleet,
All with the Prince of Parma.
All with the Prince of Parma.
7.
They coasted round about our Land,
And so came in by Dover:
But we had men set on'um then,
And threw the Rascals over,
And threw the Rascals over.
8.
The Queen was then at Tilbury,
What could me more desire a,
And Sir Francis Drake for her sweet sake,
Did set them all on fire a,
Did set them all on fire a.
9.
Then strait they fled by Sea and Land,
That one man killed threescore a;
And had nor they all ran away,
In truth he had killed more a,
In truth he had killed more a.
10.
Then let them neither brag nor boast,
But if they come again a,
Let them take heed, they do not speed,
As they did you know when a,
As they did you know when a.
The Loyal Prisoner.
1.
BEat on proud Billows, Boreas blow,
Swell curled waves high as Jove's roof:
Your incivility shall show,
That innocence is Tempest proof:
Though furious Nero's frown, my thoughts are calm,
Then strike affliction, for your wounds are balm.
2.
That which the world miscalls a Jail,
A private Closet is to me,
Whilst a good Conscience is my bail,
And innocence my liberty:
Locks, Bars, and Solitude together met.
Makes me no Prisoner, but an Anchoret.
3.
And whilst I wish to be retired
Into this private room was turned;
As if their wisdoms had conspired
The Sallam under should be burned:
Or like those Sophies, which would drown a fish,
I am condemned to suffer what I wish.
4.
The Cynick hugs his poverty,
The Pelican her Wilderness:
And '(...) the Indians pride to be
Naked on frozen Caucasus.
Contentment cannot smart, Stoics we see,
Make torments easy to their Apathie.
5.
I Am in this Cabinet locked up,
Like some high prized Margerite:
Or like some great Mogul or Pope,
Am cloistered up from public, sight:
Retiredness is a piece of Majesty;
And thus proud Sultan, I Am as great as thee.
6.
These Manicles about my arms,
I as my Mistress Favors wear:
And for to keep my ankles warm,
I have some iron Shackles there:
These walls are but my Garrison, my Cell,
What men call Iail, does prove my Citadel.
7.
So he that stroke at Iasons life,
Thinking to have made his purpose sure,
With a malicious friendly knife,
Was only wounded to a cure.
Malice, I see, wants wit; for what is meant
Mischief oft-times proves favors by the event.
8.
What though I cannot see my King,
Neither in's Person, nor his Coin:
Yet Contemplation is a thing
Which renders what I have not mine:
My King from me what Adamants can part,
Whom I do wear engraven on my heart?
9.
Have you not seen the Nightingale
A prisoner like, cooped in a Cage?
How she does chaunt her wonted tale,
In that her narrow Hermita^?
Even then her Melody does plain^y prove,
That her Boughs are Trees, her Cage a Grove.
10.
I am that Bird whom they combine
Thus to deprive of liberty:
Although they see my Corpse confined,
Yet maugre hate, my soul is free.
Although I Am mewed, yet I can chirp and sing,
Disgrace to Rebels, Glory to my King.
On his first Love.
MY first Love whom all beauty did adorn,
Firing my heart, suppressed it with her scorn,
And since like Tinder in my breast it lies,
By every sparkle made a Sacrifice:
Each wanton eye, now kindles my desire,
And that is now to all, which was entire:
For now my wanton thoughts are not confined
Unto a woman, but to woman kind:
This for her shape I love, that for her face,
This for her gesture, or some other grace:
And sometimes when I none of these can find,
I choose them by the kernel, not the rind;
And so do hope, though my chief hope be gone,
To find in many what I lost in one.
She is in fault which caused me first to stray,
Needs must he wander which has lost his way:
Guildess I am, she did this change provoke,
And made that Charcoal, which at first was Oak:
For as a Looking-glass to the aspect,
Whilst it is whole, does but one face reflect;
But cracked and broken in pieces, there are shown
Many false faces where first was but one:
So love into my heart did first prefer
Her Image, and there plan^ed none but her:
But when 'twas cracked and martyred by her scorn,
Many less faces in her sea^ were born:
Thus like to Tinder, I am prone to catch
Each falling sparkle, fit for any match.
On his Mistris^ going to Sea.
Farewell, fair Saint, may not the seas and wind
Swell like the heart and eyes you left behind:
But calm and gentle, like the looks they bear,
Smile in your face, and whisper in your car:
Let no foul billow offer to arise,
That it might nearer look upon your eyes;
Lest Wind and Waves enamored with such form,
Should throng and crowd themselves into a storm.
But if it be your fate, vast Seas, to love,
Of my becalmed heart learn how to move:
Move then but in a gentle Lovers pace,
No wrinckles, nor no furrows in your face;
And you sicrce winds, see that you tell your tale
In such a breath as may but fill her sail:
So while you court her each a several way,
You will her safely to her Port convey,
And lose her in a noble way of wooing,
Whilst both contribute to her own undoing.
On a Blush.
STay lusty blood, where will thou seek
So blessed a place as in her cheek?
How can thou from that cheek retire,
Where virtue does command desire?
But if thou can not stay, then flow
Down to her panting paps below;
Flow like a Deluge from her breasts,
Where Venus Swans have built their Nests;
And so take glory to bestain
With azure blew each swelling Vein:
Then boiling, run through every part,
Till thou have warmed her frozen heart:
And if from love it would retire,
Then Martyr it with gentle sire:
And having searched each secret place,
Fly thou back into her face:
Where live thou blessed in changing those
White L^llies to a ruddy Rose.
In praise of a Mask.
THere is not half so warm a fire
In fruition as desire:
When we have got the fruit of pain,
Possession makes us poor again.
Expected form and shape unknown,
Whets and makes sharp temptation:
Sense is too nigardly for bliss,
And daily pays us with what is.
But ignorance does give us all
That can within her brightness fall.
Veil therefore still, whilst I divine
The riches of that hidden Mine;
And make imagination tell
All wealth that can in beauty dwell.
Thus the highly valued Oar,
Earths dark Exchequer keeps in store:
And searched in secret, only quits
The travel of the hands and wits;
Who dates to ransack all the hoards,
That Natures privy Purso affords.
Our eye the apprehensions Thief,
Blinds our unlimited belief.
When we see all, we nothing see,
Disclosure may prove Robbery.
For if you shine not, fairest, be^ug shown,
I pick a Cabinet for a Bristol Stone.
Excuse for Absence.
You Will ask, perhaps, wherefore I stay,
Loving so much, so long away?
Do not think 'twas I did part;
It was my body, not my heart:
For, like a Compass, in your love
One Foot is sixth that cannot move:
To' other may follow the blind guide
Of giddy Fortune, but not slide
Beyond your Service; nor dares venture
To wander far from you the Center.
To his Mistress.
KEep on your Mask, and hide your eye,
For with beholding it I die,
Your fatal Beauty, Gorgon-like,
Dead with astonishment does strike:
Your piercing eyes, if them I see,
Are worse than Basilisks to me.
Shut from mine eyes those hills of Snow,
Their melting Valley do not show;
Those Azure paths lead to despair.
O vex me ^ot, forbear, forbear:
For whilst I thus in torment dwell,
The sight of Heaven is worse than Hell.
Your dainty voice, and warbling breath,
Sound like a Sentence past for death:
Your dangling Tresses are become
The instruments of final doom;
O if an Angel torture so
When life is done, what shall I do?
To his Mistress.
I Will tell you how the Rose did first grow red,
And whence the Lilly whiteness borrowed:
You blushed, and then the Rose with red was dight;
The Lilly kissed your hand, and so came white.
Before that time each Rose had but a stain,
The Lilly naught but paleness did contain:
You have the native color, those the dye,
They slourish only in your eye.
HIc jacet John Shorthose
Sine hose, sine shoes, sine breeches,
Qui fuit dum vixit, sine goods,
Sine lands, sine riches.
On his Mistress.
IS she not wondrous fair? O but I see
She is so much too sweet, too fair for me,
That I forget my flames, and every fi^e
Has taught me not to love, but to admire:
Just like the Sun, methinks I see her face,
Which I should gaze on still, but not embrace;
For it is Heavens pleasure that she should be sent
As pure to Heaven again, as she was lent
To us: And bid us, as we hope for bliss,
Not to profane her with a mortal kiss.
Then how cold grows my Love, and I how hot?
O how I love her, how I love her not!
So does my Ague-love torment by turns,
And now it freezeth, now again it burns.
A Sigh.
GO thou gentle whisp'ring' Wind,
Bear this Sigh, and if you find
Where my cruel Fair does rest,
Cast it in her snowy Breast:
The sweet Kisses thou shall gain,
Will reward thee for thy pain.
Taste her lips, and then confess,
If Arabia does possess
Or the Hybla honored hill,
Sweets like those that there distill.
Having got so, with a fee
Do another boon for me:
Thou can with thy powerful blast
Heat apace, and cool as fast:
Then for pity either stir
Up the fire of Love in her,
That alike both slames may shine,
Or else quite extinguish mine.
To a spruce and very finely decked Lady.
2.
STill to be neat, still to be dressed,
As if you were going to a feast*
Still to be powdered, still perfumed,
Lady, it is to be presumed,
Though Arts hid causes are not found,
All is not sweet, all is not sound.
2.
Give me a look, give me a face,
That makes simplicity a grace;
Robes largely slowing, hairs as free;
Such sweet neglect more takes me
Than all the Adulteries of Art:
They please my eye, but not my heart.
The Good Fellows Song.
1.
AS we went wandering all the night,
The Brewers Dog our brains did bi^e,
Our Heads grew heavy, and our Heels grew light,
And we like our humor well boys,
And we like our humor well.
2.
Our Hostess then bid us pay her Sc^re,
We called her Whore, and we paid her no more,
And we kicked our Hostess out of the door,
And we like our humor well boys,
And we like our humor well.
3.
And as we went wandering in the Street,
We trod the Kennels under our feet,
And fought with every Post we did meet,
And we like our humor well boys.
And we like our humor well.
4.
The Constable then with his staff and band,
He bid us if we were men to stand,
We told him he bid us do more than we can,
And we like our humor well boys,
And we like our humor well.
5.
Our Hostesses Cellar it is our bed,
Upon the Barrels we lay our head,
The night is our own, for the Devil is dead,
And we like our humor well boys,
And we like our humor well,
Upon Fasting.
THe poor man fasts, because he has no meat;
The sick man fasts, because he cannot eat:
The Userer fasts, to increase his store:
The Glutton fasts, 'cause he can eat no more;
The Hypocrite, because he would be commended:
The Saints do fast, because they have offended.
ONe wished me to a Wife that is fair and young,
That has French, Spanish, and Italian tongue:
I thanked him, but yet I Will have none of such;
For I think one tongue for a Maid's too much:
What, love you not the Learned? yes as my life.
The learned Scholar, but the unlearned Wife.
On a Lover that would not be beloved again.
DIsdain me still, that I may ever love,
For who his love enjoys, can love no more:
The War once past, with peace men cowards prove,
The ships returned do rot upon the shore,
Then frown though I say thou art m^st fair,
And still I love thee, though I still despair.
As heat to life, so is desire to love,
For these once quenched, both life and love are done:
Let not my sighs and tears thy virtues move
Like basest Metal do not melt so soon,
Laugh at my woes although I ever mourn,
Love surfeits with rewards, his Nurse is scorn.
A Rural Song.
1.
COme Lads and Lasses, each one that passes,
Dance a round on the ground
Whilst green the grass is.
For if you will ever, with mirth endeavor
With heart and voice, rejoice,
Come now or never:
For the blind Boy Love was caught and betrayed
In the Trap that was laid
For the poor silly Maid.
2.
Now here, now yonder, with Goose and Gander,
With your Ducks, Hens, and Cocks,
Safe may you wander,
Securely may you go, to the Market to and fro,
John and Ione all arow,
And never fear the foe,
For the blind Boy Love was caught and betrayed
In the Trap that was laid
For the poor silly Maid.
3.
Sweetest come hither, let us thither,
Where we will court, and there sport
Freely together.
We Will enjoy kisses, with other blisses,
So come home, when we have done,
And none shall miss us.
For the blind Boy Love was caught and betrayed
In the Trap that was laid,
For the poor silly Maid.
4.
Over you Bower; Jove seems to lowre,
As he meant to prevent
Our happiest hour:
But the times treasure, giving us leisure
In spite of Jove, for to prove
Our chiefest pleasure.
For the blind Boy Love was caught and betrayed
In the Trap that was laid,
For the poor silly Maid.
A Scotch Song, called Gilderoy.
1.
WAS ever grief so great as mine,
Then speak dear Bearn, I prithee,
That thus must leave my Gilderoy,
O my Benison gang with thee.
Good speed be with you then Sir, she said,
For gone is all my joy:
And gone is he whom I love best,
My handsome Gilderoy.
2.
In muckle joy we spent our time
Till we were both fifteen,
Then wantonly he ligg'd me down,
And amongst the B^akes so green.
When he had done what man could do,
He rose up and gang'd his way:
I gate my Goon, and I followed him,
My handsome Gilderoy.
3.
Now Gilderoy was a bonny Boy,
Would needs to the King be gone,
With his silken Garters on his legs,
And the Roses on his shoone:
But better he had staid at home
With me his only joy,
For on a Gallow-tree they hung
My handsome Gilderoy.
4.
When they had taken this lad so strong,
Good Lord how sore they bound him,
They carried him to Edenb'rough Town,
And there God wot they hung him:
They knit him fast above the rest,
And I lost my only joy,
For evermore my Benison
Gang with my Gilderoy.
5.
Woe worth that man that made those Laws,
To hang a man for genee,
For neither stealing Ox nor Ass,
Or bony Horse or Mere:
Had not their Laws a bin so strict,
I might have got my joy:
And never had need tull a wat my check
For my dear Gilderoy.
A Song to his Mistress.
1.
I Will not do a Sacrifice
To thy face or to thy eyes:
Nor unto thy Lilly palm,
Nor thy breath that wounding balm:
But the part to which my heart
In vows is sealed,
Is that Mine of Bliss Divine
Which is concealed.
2.
What Is the Golden fruit to me,
If I may not pluck the Tree:
Bare enjoying all the rest,
Is but like a golden Feast,
Which at need can never feed
Our lovesick wishes:
Let me eat substantial meat,
Not view the dishes.
The Advice.
PHyllis for shame, let us improve
A thousand several ways,
These few short minutes stolen by love
From many tedious days.
Whilst you want courage to despise
The censure of the Grave:
For all the Tyrants in your eyes,
Your heart is but a slave.
My love is full of noble pride,
And never will submit
To let that Fop Discretion ride
In triumph over Wit.
False Friends I have as well you,
That daily counsel me
Vain friv'lous trisles to pursue,
And leave off loving thee.
When I the least belief bestow
On what such fools advise,
May I be dull enough to grow
Most miserably wise.
A Vision.
BEneath a Myrtle shade
Which Jove for none but happy Lovers made,
I slept, and straight my Love before me brought,
Phillis the object of my waking thought,
Undrest she came my flames to meet,
Whilst Love strewn flowers beneath her feet:
Flowers that so pressed by her became more sweet.
From the bright Visions head,
A careless vail of Lawn was Loosely spread:
From her white shoulders fell her shaded hair,
Like cloudy Sunshine, nor too brown nor fair:
Her hands, her lips did love inspire,
Her every part my heart did fire:
But most her eyes, that languish'd with desire.
Ah charming Fair, said I,
How long will you my bliss and yours deny?
By nature and by Jove this lonesome Shade
Was for revenge of suffering Lovers made:
Silence and Shades with Love agree,
Both shelter you, and favor me;
You cannot blush, because I cannot see,
No, let me die, she said,
Rather than lose the spotless name of Maid:
Faintly she spoke methought, for all the while
She bid me not believe her with a smile.
Then die, said I: She still denied:
And is it thus, thus, thus, she cried,
You use a harmless Maid? And so she died.
I waked, and straight I knew
I loved so well, it made my Dream prove true.
Fancy the kinder Mistress of the two,
Fancy had done what Phillis would not do.
Ah cruel Nymph, cease your disdain,
While I can dream you scorn in vain:
Asleep or waking you must ease my pain.
The Bachelors Song.
LIke a Dog with a Bottle fast tied to his Tail,
Like a Vermin in a Trap, or a Thief in a Jail,
Like a Tory in a Bog,
Or an Ape with a Clog,
Even such is the man, who when he may go free,
Does his Liberty lose
In a Matrimony Noose,
And sells himself into Captivity.
The Dog he does howl when the Bottle does jog,
The Vermin, the Thief, and the Tory in vain
Of the Trap, of the Jail, of the Quagmire complain,
But well fare poor Pug,
For he plays with his Clog;
And though he would be rid on it rather than his life,
Yet he hugs it and tugs it as a Man does his Wife.
The Batchelors Satyr re^orted.
1.
LIke a Dog that runs madding at Sheep or at Cows,
Like a Boar that runs brumling after the Sows,
Like a Jade full of Rancor,
Or a Ship without Anchor,
Such is the Libertine whom sense invites
To spend his leisures
In recoyling pleasures,
And prefers Looseness unto Hymen's Rites:
Whereas that honest Tedder holds
The Dog from ranging to the Folds;
And the soft tie of sixth desire,
Keeps men from that Boarish mire;
The Bit and Reins
The Horse restrains,
And the Anchor saves
The Ship from Waves
Vermin indeed are often deserv'dly caught
In their own Traps,
Venereous Claps,
Which Health and Wealth and Conscience dearly bought.
2.
Those Felons of themselves are their own Jails,
And by stolen Pleasure do their sin intail;
Such wandering Tories in unknown Bogs,
And busy Urchins are ensaf'd by Clogs:
But well fare that Bird,
That sweetly is heard
To sing in the contented Cage,
Secure from fears,
And all the snares
Of a Licentious and trepanning Age,
Passing a calm harmonious Life,
Just like an honest Man and Wife.
A Reply to the Batchelors Satyr retorted.
LIke a Cat with her Tail fast hel'd by a Peg,
Like a Hog that gruntles when he is tied by the leg,
Like a galled Horse in a Pownd,
Or a Ship run a ground:
Such is the Man, who tied in a Nuptial Nooze,
With the proud Stoic, brags
Of his Patches, and his Rags
And rails at looseness, yet would fain get loose,
Whereas the Cat, not knowing who vexed her,
Tooth and nail assaults the thing that is next her;
And the soft tie of fixed desire
Binds the Hog to the Paradise of his dear Mire:
The Horse frisks about,
But cannot get out;
And the Anchor gives way
To the boisterous Sea.
Husbands indeed are often deserv'dly caught
In their own Traps,
By others Claps,
Or Midwives, Nurses, Cradles dearly bout.
These Felons to themselves are their own Jail:
Some on the Parish do their Bratsentail,
Like Tories from their Wives and Children run,
Designing but to Do, and be Undone:
Or else like Hedghogs under Crabtrees roll,
To bring home to their Drabs
A burden of Crabs,
And then retire to their Hole.
But well fare the Owl,
Of all feathered Fowl,
That in the contented Ivy-bush sings;
She dodders all day,
While the little birds play,
And at midnight she flutters her wings,
Hooting out her mopish discontented Life,
Just like and honest man and Wife,
On a Wedding.
HOw pleasant a thing, were a Wedding,
And a Bedding?
If a Man could purchase a Wife
For a twelvemonth and a day:
But to live with her all a man's life,
For ever and for ay,
Till she grows as gray as a Cat:
Good faith, Mr. Parson, excuse me for that.
The Answer.
HOw honest a thing is a Wedding,
And a Bedding?
If a man but make choice of a virtuous Wife,
To live with for aye,
Not a month and a day,
But to love and to cherish all days of his life,
Till both are grown grave, rich, fruitful, and fat:
Good sooth (Sir) there needs no excuses for that.
And thus against all Sirens safely stands
The wise Ulysles tied with Nuptial Bands.
Upon His Majesty's Picture drawn by a Fair Lady.
YOur hand with Nature at a noble strife,
Has paid our Sovereign a great share of Life.
Strange fate! that Charles did never more firmly stand,
Then when twice rescued by a female hand.
Fair Voucher of the Royal Head, which we owe
Though first to Madam Lane, yet next to you.
But here your glory much does hers outvie,
She used disguise, you use discovery:
And sure there is not so much of Honor shown
To save by hiding, as by making known:
Yet hence for you the odds do higher lie,
She saved from Death, you from Mortality;
Who in despite of fate can give reprieve,
And in this deathless Image make him live.
Warwicks great worth must quit the leaves of same,
There never was a make-^ing till you came.
Had Shiva's Queen known thus, she need not roam,
Sh' had seen the Learned Monarch nearer home.
O how Vandike would fret himself, by you
Baffled at once in the Art and Object too!
Nature her self amazed, does scarce yet know
For certain, whether, she drew both, or you:
And we, seeing so much life in the Image shown,
Fear least it speak, and lay a Claim to the Crown.
And the vulgar apt to a more gross mistake,
Should Charles but for his Pictures Picture take.
Who knows what harm might from your pencil come
If Painting had not been an Art that is dumb.
W^r^'sters strict search had ceased, did Cromwell know
How much of Charles your hand could to him show;
And the great Rebel would contented be
To have him murdered in this Effigy;
Wherein he does so much himself appear,
I am in the Presence whilst I spy him here.
His Crown he may from others hands receive,
But only you Charles to himself could give.
To be thus lively drawn, is the only thing
Could almost make me wish my self a King.
Go on, Fair Hand, and by a nobler Art
Make Charles a Prince complete in every part:
And to the world this rare example show,
You can make Kings, and get them Subjects too,
FINIS.
Westminster Drollery, THE SECOND PART; BEING A Complete Collection of all the
Newest and Choicest SONGS and POEMS at COURT and both the THEATERS.
By the Author of the FIRST PART, never Printed before.

LONDON, Printed for William Gilbert at the Half Moon in (...)

These to his honored Friend, the Author of this Book, upon his WESTMINSTER
DROLLERY.
HAving perused your Book, I there do find
The footsteps of a most Ingenious mind;
Which (traceing) I never left, until I came
Unto the knowledge of the Authors Name;
Which having understood, I needs must show
That due respect I to your Lines do owe.
How easy is it for a man to know
Those Songs you made, from those Collected too?
Yours like Rich Vyands on a Table set,
Invites all Pallats for to taste and eat;
T^' others but garnish are, which only serve
To feed a hungry stomach, least it starve;
Yours like the Sun, when he displayes his face,
Obscures, and darkens Stars of meaner Race:
So Sir, in every thing you so transcend,
That I could wish your Drolleries no end:
But least my youthful Poetry should stray
From their intentions, and so lose their way,
I Will wish your fame may be as amply known
As he desires, who speaks himself your own.

WESTMINSTER DROLLERY.
The late Song at the Dukes House.
SInce we poor slavish women know
Our men we cannot pick and choose,
To him we like, why say we no?
We both our time and labor loose:
By our put offs, and fond delays,
A Lovers Appetite we pall;
And if too long the Gallant stays,
His Stomack's gone for good and all.
Or our impatient Amorous guest
Unknown to us away may steal,
And rather than stay for a feast
Take up with some course ready meal.
When opportunity is kind,
Let prudent women be so too;
And if a man be to her mind,
Till, till, -- she must not let him go.
The match soon made is happy still,
For only love, it is best to do
For none should marry against their will,
But stand off when their Parents woe,
And only to their Suits be coy;
For she whom Jointures can obtain
To let a Fopp her bed enjoy,
Is but a lawful wench for gain.
A late Song called The Resolute Gallant for a second Trial.
HOw hard a fate have I that must expire
By sudden sparkles Love has blown to fire:
No pain like mine, 'cause fed with discontent,
Not knowing how these flames I may prevent.
Lucinda's eyes affection have compelled,
And ever since in thraldom I have dwelt;
Yet which is more, s^^ who is my sole delight
Belongs unto another man by right.
What though she do? bear up dejected mind,
She that is faired does seldom prove unkind;
She may be so, I Will put it to a venture;
Who tryes no Circle, may mistake the Center.
For joys themselves are only tr^e when tried,
Frui^ion is the comfort of a Bride;
And how can he enjoy that never does try
But is dishearted with a Female fie?
(When known to most) they willingly resign
What they do seem as willing to decline,
Why then should I desist, I Will try again,
They 'steeme the valiant lover the best of men.
The Subtle Girl well fitted. The Tune The New Boxy.
Prithee Cloris tell me how
I Have been to thee Disloyal;
In love thou know who makes a vow,
It Is only but on trial:
For had I found, thy graces sound,
Which first I did discover,
There Is none should be more kind to thee,
Or half so true a Lover.
2.
I vowed it is true, I Will tell you how,
With mental reservation,
To try if thou would keep thy vow,
And find thine Inclination;
But when I saw thou did withdraw
Thy faith from me to changing,
Why shoul'dst thou blame me for the same
To take my swing in ranging.
3.
No Cloris know, the knack I Have found
Of this thy feigned passion,
Thou know my elder brother's drowned
And chinks with me in fashion;
And likewise know, I Have made a vow
To one did never deceive me
Who in the worst of times she durst
Both visit and relieve me.
4.
Then farewell Cloris false and fair,
And like thee every woman,
Nor more will wear thy lock of hair,
Thy favors now are common;
But I will wear Aminta dear
Within my heart for ever,
Whose fair and kind, and constant mind,
To cherish I Will endeavor.
The New Scotch Song.
SIt' tha' do'on be me, mine awn sweet joy,
Thouse quite kill me suedst thou prove coy,
Suedst thou prove coy, and not loove me.
Where sall I fiend sike a can as thee.
2.
Is'e bin at Weke, and Is'e bin at Fair,
Yet near coo'd I find can with thee to compare;
Often have I sought, yet never cood I find
Ean I loov'd like thee, 'gen you prove kind.
3.
Thou'se have a gay goone, an gea fine,
With brave buskins thy feet sall shine,
With the fin'st sloores thy head sall be crowned,
An thy pink-patticoat sall be lac't round.
4.
VVee'se gang early to the brook side,
VVee'se catch fishes as they do glide,
Every little fish thy prisner sall be,
Thou'fe catch them, an I'se catch thee.
5.
Coom let me kiss thy cherry Lip, an praise
Aw the features, a thy sweet face,
Thy forehead so smooth and lofty does rise,
Thy soft ruddy cheeks, and thy pratty black eyes.
6.
Ise ligg by thee all the caw'd niete,
'Thou's^ want neathing for thy deleete;
Thouse have any thing, thouse ha me,
Sure I ha soom thing that'le please thee.
The Answer to the Scotch Song, and to that Tune.
1.
SIbby cries to the wood, coom follow me,
^or I'se have a fiene thing my Billy for thee,
It i like a thing which I mun not tell,
Yet I ken Billy thou'se love it well.
2.
Billy cries, wa is me, and sight vary sear
Cause to his Sibby he cood not come near,
At last he tald her with many a greane
Ise cannot follow Sibby for meerter and steane.
3.
Thou ken'st Billy, Is'e loove thee we will,
And for thy Love my Patticoat wa'd sell;
I'se loove thee dearly we will as mine ean mother,
Thou'se pull down ean side, and I'se pull down the other.
4.
Sibby gang'd to the Wail to pull it done,
Billy ean the tea side came there as soon;
Then she pulled done the steane, and Billy the meerter,
That of his ^^atty Sibby he might be the Peerter.
The rejected Lover to his Mistress.
1.
WHat means this strangen^ss now of late,
Since time does truth approve,
Such difference may consist with state,
In cannot stand with love.
2.
It Is either cunning or distrust,
Does such ways allow;
The first is base, the last unjust,
Let neither blemish you.
3.
Explain with unsuspitious looks
The Riddles of your mind,
The eyes are Cupids fortune Books,
Where love his fate may find.
4.
If kindness cross your wished content,
Dismiss it with a frown,
I Will give thee all the love is spent,
The rest shall be my own.
The Prologue to Wit without money: being the first Play acted after the Fire.
SO shipwrackt Passengers escape to land,
So look they, when on bare Beach they stand,
Dropping and cold; and their first fear scarce over,
Expecting famine from a desert shore;
From that hard Climate we must wait for bread
Whence even the Natives forced by hunger fled.
Our stage does humane chance present to view,
But never before was seen so sadly true,
You are changed to, and your pretense to see
Is but a nobler name of charity.
Your own provisions furnish out our feasts
Whilst you the founders make your selves our guests.
Of all mankind besides Fate had some care,
But for poor Wit no portion did prepare,
It Is left a rentcharge to the brave and fair.
You cherisht it, and now its fall you mourn,
Which blind unmannerd Zealots make their scorn,
Who think the fire a Judgment on the stage,
Which spared not Temples in its surious rage.
But as our new-built City rises higher,
So from old Theaters may new aspire,
Since Fate contrives magnificence by fire.
Our great Metropolis does far surpass
What ere is now, and equald all that was,
Our Wit as far does foreign wit excel,
And like a king should in a Palace dwell.
But we with golden hopes are vainly fed,
Talk high, and entertain you in a shed:
Your presence here, for which we humbly sue,
Will grace old Theaters, and build up new.
A Song.
OF all the brisk da^^s my Selina for me,
For I love not a woman unless she be free;
The affection that I to my Mistress do pay
Grows weary, unless she does meet me half way:
There can be no pleasure 'till humors do hit,
Then Jumping's as good in affection as wit.
No sooner I came, but she liked me as soon;
No sooner I asked, but she granted my boon;
And without a preamble, a portion or Jointer,
She promised to meet me, where e're i would appoint her;
So we struck up a match, and embraced each other
Without the consent of Father or Mother.
Then away with a Lady that is modest and coy,
Let her ends be the pleasure that we do enjoy;
Let her tickle her fancy with secret delight,
And refuse all the day, what she longs for at night:
I believe my Selina, who shows they are all mad,
To feed on dry bones, when flesh may be had.
A SONG.
Give over foolish heart, and make have to despare,
For Daphne regards not thy vows nor thy prayer
Which plead for thy passion, thy pains to prolong;
She courts her gittar, and replies with a Song.
No more shall true lovers such beauties adore,
Were the gods so severe, men would worship no more.
No more will I wait like a slave at your door,
I will spend the cold night at the windows no more;
My lungs in long sighs I Will no more exhale,
Since your pride is to make me grow sullen and pale;
No more shall Amyntas your pity implore,
Were gods so ingrate men, would worship no more.
No more shall your frowns and free humor persuade
To worship the Idol my fancy has made;
When your Saint's so neglected, your follies give 'ore
Your deity's lost, and your beauty's no more;
No more shall true lovers such beauties adore,
Were the gods so severe, men would worship no mo^^.
How weak are the vows of a lover in pain
When flarter'd with hope, or oppressed with disdain;
No sooner my Daphne's bright eyes I review,
But all is forgot, and I vow all anew.
No more fairest Nymph, I will murmur no more.
Did the Gods seem so fair, men would ever adore.
A Song.
1.
COrinna' false! it cannot be,
Let me not hear't again, it is blasphemy,
She Is divine,
Not the Shrine
Where the Vestall flames do shine
Holds out a light so constant pure as she*
First shall the nights
Out-burne those Taper lights
Which Emulate the one eyed day;
Phoebus rays
Shall outgaze
Titan in his chiefest praise;
Snow shall burn,
Floods return
To their Springs, their funeral urne,
E're my Corinna's constancy decay.
2.
Not innocence it self is free
From imputation; and 'twe^e base in me,
Where I find
Love combined
In a heart of one so kind,
To injure virtue with Jealousy.
Still do I strive
To keep my joys alive
And vindicate Corinna's fame,
Whilst my breast
Does suggest
Thoughts which violate my rest,
And my fears
Flow in Tears
Whilst they wound me through the eare's
Which cast aspersion on Corinna's name.
3.
It Is said, Corinna may it be
As false as my affection's true to thee,
That thou art!
How my heart
Greeves such terrors to impart;
Not what thou wast before to me.
This, this, destroys
My late triumphant Joys
Which sweld, when in your arms I was intwin'd.
Loves best wreath
You did breath,
You vowed to be my love till death
Sealing this
With that bliss,
Whilst with arms, and every word a kiss
Our pure souls were as our hearts combined.
Last night I walked into a grove
Among shady bowers to bewail my love,
There to find
Fate so kind
As to ease my pensive mind
Or thoughts of my Corinna to remove.
But there the Nightingale
Had hushed her pretty tale,
Leaving her ditty's to the Owl,
Which made me sad
And did add
Fuel to the flame I had:
That poor I
Now must die
Unless Corinna's constancy
Takes off this clogg which overwhelmes my soul.
The Petticoate wagge, with the Answer.
SOme say the world is full of holes,
And I think
Many a chinke
Is unstopt, that were better closed,
Is now unstopt that were better closed.
To stop them all is more than to build Paul's;
Wherefore he
That would see
How men are in private disposed,
How most men are in private disposed
Then let him look the world throughout
From the oyster-wench to the black bagg,
And peep here,
And peep there,
You Will still find the petticoate wagge.
The Answer.
SOme say the world is full of pelse,
But I think
There Is no Chinke
Because I have so little my self,
Because I have now so little my self.
Where pockets are full, there men will borrow,
But one must
Never trust
(...) to be paid to day or to morrow,
(...) to be paid to day or to morrow*
^ let him look the world throughout
From the Usurer to his best friend,
And ask here,
And ask there,
But the Devil a penny they will lend.
An Invocation to Cupid* A SONG.
YOu powers that guard loves pleasant Thron^
And guide our passions by your own,
(...) down, send down that golden dart
(...) makes two Lovers wear one heart.
Solicit Venus that her doves
which through their bills translate their loves,
May teach my tender love and I
To kiss into a Sympathy.
Pray Cupid, if it be no sin
Against nature, for to make a twinne
Of our two souls, that the others eyes
May see death cozened when one dies.
If oh you Powers you can implore
Thus much from Love, know from your store
Two Amorous Turtles shall be freed
Which yearly on your Altar bleed*
A beautiful and great Lady died in March, and was buried in April.
MArch with his winds has struck a Cedar tall,
And weeping April mournes the Cedars fall,
And May intends her month no flowers shall bring
Since she must loose the flower of all the Spring.
Then March winds have caused April showers,
And yet sad May, must loose her flower of flowers.

In the book of moons defend ye,

You never be forsaken,

Abroad to beg your Bacon.
Chor: Nor never sing, any food any feeding,
Money drink or clothing:

Of 30 bare years have I
Twice twenty bin enraged,

Three times fifteen
In durance soundly caged.
^n the lovely lofts of Bedlam, on stubble soft and dainty
Brave bracelets strong,
Sweet whips ding dong
And who some hunger plenty.
Cho^. And now I sing, any food, any feeding etc.
3.
With a thought I took for mawdlin,
And a ^ruse of ^o^kle pottage
And a thing thus -- tall

I fell into this do^age.
I slept not since the conquest,
'Till then I never waked,
'Till the Roguish Boy

Me found, and stripped me naked.
Chor: And made me sing, any food, etc.

When short I have shorn my Sowes face,
And swigg'd my horned barrel,

The flaming drake,
And the night-crow make
Me music to my sorrow.

To repose in Paul's,
With walking souls,
I never am affrighted.
Chor: But still do I sing, any food etc.
6.
I know more than Apollo,
For often when he lies sleeping,
I behold the Stars
At mortal wars,
And the wounded Welkin weeping;
The Moon embrace her shepherd,
And the queen of Love her warrior,
Whilst the first does horn,
The star of the morn,
And the next the heavenly Farrier.

The Gipsy Snap, and Tedro,
Are none of Tom's Comrades,
The Punke I scorn,

But those that cross
Tom's Rhinoceros
Do what the Panther dare not.
Chor: Although I sing, any food etc.
8.
Which a heart of furious fancies,
Whereof I am commander,
With a burning spear,
And a horse of Air,
To the wilderness I wander;
With a Knight of Ghosts and shadows,

Ten leagues beyond
The wide worlds end,
Methinks it is no journey.

Disdain I shift and sharking,
No loves but these,
Do my fancy please,
No delight, or life to marking.
Chor: Wherefore I sing
Any marking,
Marking red or yellow,
Come, come, and buy,
Or say you why,
You deny so brave a fellow.

A wo^rs Expostulation.
1.
ALl day do I sit inventing,
While I live so single alone,
Which way to Wed to my contenting,
And yet can resolve upon none.
There Is a wench whose wealth would enrich me,
But she not delights me;
There Is another eyes do bewitch me,
But her fashion frights me.
He that herein
Has a traveller bin
And at length in his Longing sped.
What shall I do,
Tell me who I shall woe,
For I long to be lustily wed.
2.
Shall I with a Widow marry;
No, no, she such watch will bear
To spy how my self I do carry.
I shall always live in fear.
Shall I to a maid be a wooer,
Maidens are loved of many,
Knowing not to whom to be sure*
Are unsure to any.
Marry with youth,
There is love without truth,
For the young cannot long be just,
And Age if ^ prove;
There is truth without Love,
For the Old are too cold to Lust.
The Resolution.
1.
I Dye, when as I do not see
Her, who is my life, and all to me;
And when I see her then I dye
In seeing of her cruel^y,
So that to me like m^sery is wrought,
Both when I see, and when I see her no^.
2.
Shall I in silence mourn and grieve?
Who silent sorrows will relieve?
In speaking not my heart will rend*
And speaking I ^^y her ^^^end.
So that 'twixt Love and death my heart is shot
With equal dar^s, speak I, or speak I not.
3.
Since life and death is in her Eye,
If her I not behold, I dye;
And if I look on her she kills,
I Will choose the least of two such ills;
Though both be hard, this is the easier lot,
To dye and see, than dye and see her not
4.
Yet when I see her I shall speak;
For if I speak not, heart will break;
And if I speak I can but dye,
Of two such ills the least i will try;
Who dies unseen or dumb is soon forgot,
I Will see and speak then, dye, or dye I not.
Love, himself in Love
1.
AS in May the little god of love
Forsook his Mothers rosy rest
To play, to wanton, and to rove
His quiver where it pleased him best*
VVanting sport
In idle sort
An arrow where he could not tell
From him glanced,
So it chanced
Love thereby in Love besell.
2.
In sad Tears he to his mother prayed
(to seek his shaft) to lend him eyes,
Which she grants: a bright and lovely
Love taking up his dart espies;
But poor lad
He better had
Near seen at all, then now too well,
For being struck,
With her fair look
Love himself in love besell.
3.
She too true a chastity embraced,
And from Loves courtship, and his (...)
Nicely flew; but when his hour was passed
His sorrow with his sight was gone.
With us swains,
She now remains;
And every shepherds boy can tell,
This is she
That love did see
Who seeing her in love besell
4.
Some thus wish, that Love had never shot,
(That thereof with him feel the woe)
Some dispute that Love a God is not,
And think that beauty bears the bow,
Since this maid,
Without his aid,
Does her beholders all compel,
Now to fall
Into that thrall
Where Love himself in Love befell.
5.
Simple Swains could wish their eyes were blind
For in her speech and every grace,
Are such chains to captivate the mind,
They love her that never saw her face.
Liking lies
Not all in Eyes,
No^ Charms in Cheeks do only dwell,
Love had power,
But for an hour,
To see, and so in love besell.
6.
Since in troop of many wretched men
I her enchanting looks survay'd,
Though I droop, I languish, yet again,
To see, and yet to see affrayd.
But O why,
With shame should I
Consume for what I love so well;
First I Will try
Her love, and dye
With fame, where love in love befell.
The Matchless Maid.
1.
AMidst the merry May,
When wantons would a playing,
A Girl as any gay
That had no mind a Maying,
By a clear
Fountain brim,
Shedding tears,
Shaming him,
Sat, and said, are all they
With their Mates gone to May,
And on a Sun-shiny day
Must I be cast away,
O, to dye a Maid.
2.
One hand she laid to calm
Her breast that ever panted,
And on her other palm
Her dewy Cheek she planted,
All a loft
Covered ore
With the soft silks she wore,
And underneath a bed
Of Lillyes had she spread
Whereon she was, she sed
Fully determined
O to dye a Maid.
3.
Is It love, quoth she, or lot,
Whose fault I am not mated?
Has Cupid me forgot,
Will fortune have me hated?
O ill men
Though ye be
Fewer then
Wretched we;
Must I needs be one,
For whom there mate is none,
None need her death bemone
(Than) that was borne alone,
O, to dye a Made
4.
And so into a swound
She fell; and in a trembling
Fell I, when as I found
A maid; and no dissembling:
To her quick
Did I stepp,
Felt her thick
Pulses leap,
Brake her blew Belt in twain,
Into her cheeks again,
Kissed that Vermilion stain,
Nature did never ordain.
O to dye a Maid.
5.
But like to him that wrought
A face that him Enchanted,
And life for it besought,
Which Cytherea granted,
Fared I
(fool) that should
Let her dye
When she would.
For with that soul she brought,
Back from the shades she sought,
Am I now deeply caught
In love, that ever thought
O to die a Maid.
One and his Mistress a dying.
1.
SHall we die,
Both thou and I,
And leave the world behind us;
Come I say
And lets away,
For no body here does mind us.
2.
Why do we gape,
We cannot escape
The doom that is assigned us;
When we are in grave,
Although we rave,
There no body needs to bind us.
3.
The Clark shall sing,
The Sexton ring,
And old wives they shall wind us
The Priest shall lay
Our bones in clay,
And no body there shall find us.
4.
Farewell wits,
And folly's fits,
And griefs that often pined us;
When we are dead,
We Will take no heed
What no body says behind us.
5.
Merry nights,
And false delights
Dieu, ye did but blind us;
We must to mold,
Both young and old,
Til no body's left behind us.

A Late Poem by a Person of quality.
What dire Aspects wore the enraged sky
At the cursed moment of my birth: O why
Did envious Fate prolong my loathsome age,
Since all mankind, yea all the Gods engage
To bend their never-ceasing spite on me alone,
Am I the center of their envy grown?
Am I the man
On whom they all their venomed weapons try
Made for their sport, and mankinds mockery,
Or was it ye Gods that you did me create
Only to make me thus unfortunate?
Or do I owe a being to some other powers
VVho'l make me able to deride all yours?
If so,
From these unknown Patrons I Will obtain
A power to stay your deemed eternal reign,
I Will ravish Nature, from which rape shall come
A Race, shall ruin your ill guarded throne;
Rocks, hills, and mountains, we will sling at the Sky;
Whole torn up Regions in Joves face shall fly.
We Will drai^e the Seas
With hills of water, quench the angry stars;
Nor will we put an end to these just wars,
'Till conquered Jove shall learn to obey,
And I more powerful shall his Scepter sway;
The heavens to their first source shall then return,
The Earth to her Autumnal being run:
And stubborn mankind I will new create:
On all I will impose new laws of Fate.
On Women.
WOmen are called Eves,
Because they came from Adams wife,
Put to t^h, and they are Thieves,
They rob men of a merry life;
Put ls to Eve, and then they are Evils,
Put d before evils, and then they are Devils:
And thus our Eves are made thieves, and thieves are evils
And angry Women are a thousand times worse than Devils.
The Valentine.
1.
AS youthful day put on his best
Attire to usher morn,
And she to greet her glorious guest
Did her fair self adorn;
Up did I rise, and hid mine eyes
As I went through the street,
Least I should one that I despise
Before a fairer meet;
And why
Was I,
Think you so nice and fine,
Well did I wot,
Who wotts it not,
It was St Valentine
2.
In fields by Phoebus great with young
Of Flower's and hopeful budds,
Resembling thoughts that freshly sprung
In lovers lively bloods,
A dam'sel fair and fine I saw,
So fair and finely dight,
As put my heart almost in aw
To attempt a mate so bright:
But O,
Why so,
Her purpose was like mine,
And readily,
She said as I,
Good morrow Valentine.
3.
A Fair of love we kept a while,
She for each word I said
Gave me two smiles, and for each smile
I her two kisses paid.
The Violet made have to appear
To be her bosom guest,
With first Primrose that grew this year
I purchased from her breast;
To me, gave she, her golden lo^k for mine;
My ring of Jet,
For her Bracelet,
I gave my Valentine.
4.
Subscribed with a line of love,
My name for her I wrote;
In silk form her name she wove,
VVhereto this was her mot --
As shall this year thy truth appear
I still my dear am thine:
Your mate to day, and Love for aye,
If you so say, was mine.
While thus, on us, each others favors shine,
No more have we to change, quoth she,
Now farewell Valentine.
5.
Alas, said I, ^e^ friends not seem
Between themselves so strange,
The Jewels both we dear'st esteem
You know are yet to change:
She answers no, yet smiles as though
Her tongue her thought denies;
Who truth of maidens mind will know,
Must seek it in her Eyes.
She blush^,
I wished,
Her heart as free as mine,
She sight and swear,
Insooth you are
Too wanton Valentine.
6.
Yet I such further favor won
By suit and pleasing play,
She vowed what now was left undone,
Should finished be in May.
And though perplexed with such delay*
As more augments desire,
Twixt present grief, and promised Joy;
I from my Mate re^ire*
If she
To me
Preserve her vows divine
And constant troth,
She shall be both
My Love and Valentine.
On Thirsis and Phillis.
YOung Thirsis the shepherd, that wont was to keep
So delightful slocks and fair,
Sets eyes upon Phillis, and lets go the Sheep
To wander he knows not where.
The cropping of Lillyes,
Was as became Phillis,
That seemed with her brow to compare;
He tuning of Verses,
Was as became Thirsis,
That more did her beauty declare.
2.
Why like thou those flowers that are not like thee,
Thou art far more fresh and gay,
Or if thou love Lillyes, why love thou not me
That am Lovesick and pale as they?
Thy bosom fair Phillis
Yields lovlyer Lillyes
Surpassing the sweetness of those,
Whose beauty so pierces
The poor heart of Thirsis
That these more resemble his woes.
3.
Art thou a Shepherdess, and yet too good
For a Shepherd to be thy mate?
If wanton opinion, or pureness of blood,
Does make thee disdain thy estate,
Let Thirsis pluck Lillyes,
And feed flocks for Phillis
For her love his duty to show,
Whilst Phillis rehearses,
The Poesies of Thirsis
In his love her beauty to know.
4.
If Goridons jealousy cannot admit
Young Thirsis his rival to be,
Thy heart is too young to be singular yet,
And too old to be loved is he.
Then try what the skill is
Of young men fair Phillis
Ere age thou do simply retain;
If any love pierces
Thee deeper than Thirsis,
Let Thirsis love Phillis in vain,
5.
Thus Thirsis went, on but Phillis more wise
Conceales the delight she find,
For women their likings have skill to disguise,
But men cannot masque their minds.
He mounts where the hill is,
The proud hill where Phillis,
Is wonted to rest with her sheep;
And with his ^lock Thirsis,
So seldom converses,
We think he with Phillis does keep.
A Song.
1.
TO love thee without flattery were a sin,
Since thou art all Inconstancy within,
Thy heart is governed only by thine Eyes,
^he newest object is thy richest prize,
Love me then just as I love thee,
That Is 'till a fairer I can see.
2.
I hate this constant doting on a Face,
Content never dwells a week in any place;
Why then should you and I love one another
Longer than we can our fancy smother;
Love me then just as I love thee,
That Is 'till a fairer I can see*
A Song.
1.
When Thirsis did the splendid Eye
Of Phillis his fair Mistress spy,
Was ever such a glorious Queen
Said he, unless above, twere seen.
2.
Fair Phillis with a blushing air,
Hearing those words became more fair;
Away, says he, you need not take
Fresh beauty, you more fair to make.
3.
Then with a winning smile and look,
His candid flattery she took;
O stay, said he, it is done I vow,
Thirsis is captivated now.
A catch for three Voices, made from a true Story.
1.
A Knot of good fellows were making moan,
Their meeting was spoild, their pig was gone*
Whee, quoth a Frenchman to Joan, its dark,
Hark there, cries Mounseir, Pig, weel make him pork;
They caught him, and stuck him, wee' wee', what you do
To serve you like the mother of the meaz'ld sow?
Begar me no Bacon, you English dog;
Weeh, weeh, you rask all Frenchman, we will dress you like a hogg?
They kept such a weehing that home came the Pigg,
Which made them all dance, and drink as long as they could swig,
They cry the Mounseir pardon, and forth let him pass
No more for a Pigge, but now for an Ass.
A Catch of 3 Parts.
1.
MY Mistress will not be content to take a Jest,
I mean a Jest as Chaucer meant:
But following still the Women's fashion,
Allows it, allows it, in the last translation;
For with the word she will not dispense,
And yet, and yet, and yet, I know she loves the sense.
On Loyalty in the Cavaliers.
1.
HE that is a clear
Cavalier
Will not repine,
Although his fortune grow
So very low
That he cannot get wine.
Fortune is a Lass,
She will embrace,
And strait destroy;
Freeborn Loyalty
Will ever be,
Sing Vive le Roy.
Chorus.
^ertue is her own reward, and fortune is a Whore,
There Is none but knaves and fools regard
Her, or do her power implore.
A real honest man,
Might a'bin utterly undone,
To show his Allegiance,
His love and obedience;
Honor will raise him up,
And still praise him up,
Virtue stays him up,
Whilst your Loose Courtiers dine
With their full Bowls of Wine,
Honor will stick to it fast;
And he that fights for love, does in the way of honor move;
He that is a true Roger, and has served his King,
Although he be a ragged Soldier;
Whilst those that make sport of us,
May become short of us,
^te will flatter them, and will scatter them,
Whilst that Loyalty
Waits on Royalty,
He that waits peacefully,
May be successfully
Crowned with Crowns at last.
2.
Firmly let us then
Be honest men,
And kick at fate,
We shall live to see
Loyalty,
Valued at a high rate.
He that bears a word
Or a sword,
Against the Throne,
Or does profanely prate
To wrong the State,
Has but little for his own.
Chorus.
What though the Plumes of painted Players.
Be the prosperous men,
Yet we will attend our own affairs,
When we come to it again.
Treachery may be faced with light,
And leachery lined with furre,
A Cuckold may be made a Knight,
It Is fortune de la gar;
But what is that to us boys,
That now are honest men?
We Will conquer and come again,
Beat up the drum again,
Hey for Cavaliers,
Joy for Cavaliers,
Pray for Cavaliers,
Dub a dub dub,
Have at old Beelzebub,
Oliver stinks for fear.
Fist-Monarchy must down-boyes
And every Sect in Town,
We Will rally, and to it again,
Give 'em the rout again,
When they come again,
Charge'em home again,
Face to the right about, tantararara,
This is the life of an honest poor Cavalier.
The Irish footmans, O hone,
1.
NOw Chree'st me save,
Poor Irish Knave, O hone, O hone,
Round about,
The Town throughout,
Is poor Shone gone,
Master to find,
Loving and kind,
But Shone to his mind is never the near,
Shone can find none here,
Which makes him cry for fear
O hone, O hone,
Shone being poor,
Him's foot being sore,
For which he will no more
Trot about,
To find master out,
Fai^ I Will rather go without And cry O ^one.
2.
I was so crossed,
That I was for^'^,
To go barefoo^,
With stripes to boot,
And no shoes none
Nill English could I speak,
My mind for to break,
And many laughed to hear the moan I made,
And I like a tired Jade,
That had no work nor Trade
But cried O hone.
Cause Church to go,
Whither I Would or no,
^le dye or do so,
Grace a Chreest;
^or I love Popish Priest
A poor Catholic thou see, O hone, O hone.
^
Good honest Shone,
Make no more moan,
For thy lost,
^do intend,
Something to spend
On Catholics thus crossed;
Take this small gift,
And with i^ make a shift,
And be not thou berest;
Of thy mind;
Although he was unkind,
^o leave thee thus behind, To cry O hone.
Here take this Beer, and with it make good cheer,
^othing's for thee too dear; so a due,
^e constant still and true,
This country do not true, Nor cry O hone,
4.
Good Shentlemen,
That do intend,
To help poor Shone at's need;
My Patron here,
Has given me Beer,
And meat where^n to feed,
Yea and moneys too,
So I hope that you
Will do as he did do,
For my relief,
To ease my pain and grief.
I Will eat no ^owder'd beef,
What e're ensue.
But I will keep my fast,
As I did in times past,
To get more stomach for my hungry throat,
And (...) for friends I sought,
They called me all te're naught
Song.
I Went to the Tavern, and then,
I went to the Tavern, and then,
I had good store of Wine,
And my cap full of coin
And the world went well with me then, then,
And the world went well with me then.
^
I went to the Tavern again,
Where I ran on the score
And was turned out of the door,
And the world went ill with me then, then, etc.
^
When I was a Bachelor then
I had a Saddle and a Horse,
And I took my own course,
And the world went well with me then, then, etc.
4.
But when I was married, O then
My Horse and my Saddle
Were turned to a Cradle,
And the world went ill with me then, then, etc.
5.
When I brought her home money, then
She never would pout,
But clip me about,
And the world went well with me then, then, etc.
6.
But when I was drunk, O then,
She Would kick, she would fling,
Till she made the house ring,
And the world went ill with me then, then, etc.
7.
So I turned her away, and then,
I got me a Miss,
To clip and to kiss,
And the world went ill, etc.
8.
But the Pariter came, and then
I was called to the Court,
Where I paid for my sport,
And the world went ill etc.
9.
I took my Wife home again,
But I changed her note,
For I cut her throat,
And the world went well with me then, etc.
10.
But when it was known, O then,
In a two-wheeld Charret,
To Tiburn I was carried,
And the world went ill, etc.
11.
But when I came there, O then,
They for^'t me to swing.
To heaven in a string,
And the world went well with me then, then.
And the world went well with me then.
The Moons Love.
1.
THe Moon in her pride,
Once glanced aside
Her eyes, and espied
The day,
As unto his bed,
In wastcoat of red,
Fair Phoebus him led
The way;
Such changes of thought,
In her chastity wrought.
That thus she besought the boy,
O tarry,
And Marry
The Starry Diana,
That will be thy Jem, and Joy.
2.
I will be as bright
At noon as at night,
If that may delight
The day;
Come hither and join
Thy glories with mine,
Together we will shine
For aye.
The night shall be noon,
And every moon
As pleasant as june
Or May;
O tarry and marry etc.
3.
Enamored of none
I live chaste and alone,
Though courted of one,
Some say;
And true if it were
^o frivolous fear
Let never my dear
Dismay,
I Will change my opinion,
And turn my old Minion,
The Sleepy Endimion
Away,
O tarry and marry, etc.
4.
And but that the night,
Should have wanted her light
Or lovers in sight
Should play,
Or Phoebus should shame
To bestow such a dame
(With a dower of his flame)
On a Boy,
Or day should appear,
Eternally here,
And night otherwhere,
The day
Had tarried,
And married,
The starry'd Diana,
And she been his Jem and Joy*
On Dulcina.
1.
AS at noone Dulcina rested,
In her sweet and shady bower,
Came a shepherd and requested,
In her lapp to sleep an hour;
But from her look,
A wound he took
So deep, that for a further boon,
The Nymph he prays,
Where to she says,
Foregoe me now, come to me soon.
2.
But in vain did she conjure him,
To depart her presence so,
Having a thousand tongues to allure him,
And but one to bid him go.
Where lips invite,
And eyes delight,
And cheeks as fresh as rose in June,
Persuade to stay,
What boots her say,
Foregoe me now, come to me soon.
Words whose hopes might have enjoined
Him to let Dulcina sleep,
Could a man's love be confined,
Or a maid her promise keep;
But he her waste,
Still holds as fast,
As she was constant to her Tune
And still she spoke,
For Cupid sake
Foregoe me now, come to me (...)
4.
He demands what time or pleasure.
Can there be more soon than now?
She says Night gives love that leisure,
That the Day does not allow.
The Suns kind sight,
Forgives delight,
Quoth he, more easily than the Moon.
And Venus plays: he told, she says,
Fore^oe me now, come to me soon.
5.
But no promise nor prosession,
From his hands could purchase scope;
Who would sell the sweet possession
Of such beauty for a hope?
Or for the sight of lingering nigh^,
Foregoe the present Joys of Noon,
Though never so fair, her speeches were,
Foregoe me now, come to me soon.
6.
How at last agreed these lovers,
He was ^aire, and she was young,
Ton^^^ man tell what eye discovers,
Joy^^ ^^^seen are never sung.
Did she consent,
Or he relent,
Accepts he night, or grants she noon,
Left he her maid, or not? she said
Foregoe me now, come to me soon.
The Sailors Song.
1.
The raging waves, and roaring wind
(My Mates) I list no longer hide,
A gentler passage now I find,
And Sail upon a calmer tide
Of Neptunes man, his mate I prove,
And serve with him the master love.
2.
My bosom now my Ocean is,
Wherein my Amorous thoughts do steer,
My hopeful heart in waves of bliss,
Whereto her voice and smiling clear.
My wind and weather be: Her eyes
Are both my Loadstar, and my Prize.
3.
No sail, nor wind, nor Sun I need,
Her favors pass the silken Sail,
Her smiles the Sunshine day exceed,
And her sweet voice the softest gale?
I take no height of stars above,
Nor seek adventures, but her love.
4.
And if her heart I compass can,
Where I my hopes have Anchored all;
He that the ^leece of Cholchos wan,
Made voyage poorer than I shall,
By how much living Pearl's above
Dead gold, and wealth is short of love.
To Live and dye.
3.
A Creature so strange, so wretched a one
As I
Can there be sound,
For now alas I live, and anon
I die,
Feeling no wound;
When but a look of my love I gain,
O what a life it does infuse!
But when I taste of her sharp disaine,
O how I dye, how can I choose?
2.
Like as the Sun gives life to the flowers,
When May
Painteth the field,
So when she smiles, her eye like the powers,
Of Joy
Does to me yield,
But as the Autumn's envious rain,
Soon does the summers pride confuse
Dashed with the storms of her Disdain,
So do I dye, how can I choose.
3.
Then it is no wonder that here is a man,
Can live
Now, and now dye;
Since there is a beauty that life and death can
Both give
Out of her Eye
Ler her the wonder of time remain,
And that I live let no man muse,
While she me loves; and if she disdain,
Must not I dye, how can I choose?
4.
Has not her favor force to revive
A heart
Dying with pain?
And has her ^corne not power to deprive
That part
Of life again?
Is there not life and death in her frame
B^th at her powerful will to use,
Then at her powerful will I am,
Living or dead, how can I choose?
The hunting of the Gods.
1.
SOngs of Shepherds, and Rusticall Roundlayes,
Formed of san^yes, and whistled on reeds,
(...); to Solace young Nimphs upon holy days,
Are too unworthy for wonderful deeds.
(...) Ingenious
^r winged Cylenius
His lofty Genius,
May seem to declare,
In verse better coined,
And voice more refined
How States devin'd,
Once hunted the Have.
^^^rs Enam^^^'d wi^h Pastimes Olympi^all,
(...) and Planets that beautiful shone,
Would no longer that earthly men only shall
Swim in pleasure, and they but look on;
Round about horned
Lucina they swarmed,
And her informed
How minded they were;
Each God and Goddess,
To take humane bodies,
As Lords and Ladies,
To follow the Hare.
3,
Chaste Diana applauded the Motion,
And pale Proserpinae set in her place,
Lights the Welkin, and governs the Ocean,
While she conducted her Nephews in chase,
And by her Example,
Her Father to trample
The old and ample
Earth, leave the air,
Neptune the Water,
The Wine Liber Pater,
And Mars the slaughter,
To follow the Hare.
4.
Light god Cupid was hor^^^ upon Pegasus,
Borrowed of Muses with kisses and prayers,
Strong Alcides upon cloudy Caucasus,
Mounts a Centaure that proudly him bears.
Postillian of the sky,
Light heel'd Mercury,
Makes his Courser fly
Fleet as the air,
Yellow Apollo,
The Kennel does follow,
And whoop and hollow
After the hare
Hymen ushers the Ladies; Astreaa
The Just, took hands with Minerva the bold;
Ceres the brown, with bright Cytherea;
With Thet is the wanton, Bellona the old;
Shamefac't Aurora,
With subtle Pandora;
And May with Flora,
Did company bear;
Iuwo was stated,
Too high to be mated,
But yet she hated
Not hunting the hare.
6.
Drowned Narcissus, from his Metamorphosis
Raised by Echo, new manhood did take;
Snoring Somnus upstarted in Cineris,
That this thousand year was not awake,
To see club-footed
Old Mulciber booted,
And Paen promoted
On Chirons Mare;
Proud Faunus pouted,
And AEolus shouted,
And Momus flouted,
But followed the Hare.
Deep Melompus, and cunning Ichnobates,
^^pe, and Tigre, and Harpy^ the skies
Rent wit roaring,
Whilst huntsman-like Hercules
^inds the plentiful horn to their cries,
Till with varieties,
To solace their Pieties,
The wary Deities
Reposed them where
We shepherds were seated,
And there we repeated,
What we conceited
Of their hunting the Hare.
Young Amyntas supposed the Gods came to breath
(After some battles) themselves on the ground,
^^rsis thought the stars came to dwell here beneath,
And that hereafter the earth would go round,
Coridon aged,
With Phillis engaged,
Was much enraged
With jealous despair;
But fury vaded,
And h^ was persuaded,
When I thus applauded
Their hunting the Hare.
9.
Starr's but Shadows were, state were but sorrow
Had they no Motion, nor that no delight;
Joys are lovial, delight is the marrow
Of life, and Action the Axle of might.
Pleasure depends
Upon no other friends,
And yet freely lends
To each virtue a share,
Only as measures,
The Jewel of pleasures,
Of pleasure the treasures
Of hunting the Hare.
10.
Three broad Bowls to the Olympical Rector,
His Troy borne Eagle he brings on his knee,
Jove to Phoebus Carowses in Nector,
And he to Hermes, and Hermes to me;
Wherewith infused,
I pip'd and I mused,
In songs unused
This sport to declare;
And that the Rouse of Jove,
Round as his Sphere may move,
Health to all that love
Hunting the Hare.
The Reading Beauty.
^
AS to these lines she lent a lovely look,
Whereon not minding me she mused,
^er fair Aspect became my book,
And I her eyes (as they these lines) perused;
love songs she read, to learn what love should be,
And faster than she read she taught it me.
2.
For as no studied rules like stars above
Can teach the knowledge of the skies.
To dive into the depth of love,
There is no rule, no learning like her Eyes:
Why stoops she then to things below her reach?
Why reads she love, that she her self can teach?
3.
Alas though we no other learning need
In love, that may behold her face;
She seeing not her self must read,
To see what we so much desire to embrace.
O that her self she saw: but O why so?
She otherwise her self ^^o much does know.
4.
Some nicer lover would to see her muse
Bare envy to that happy book
Whereon she seems to doat, and use
To grant her slander by but halse her lock:
But such to me let her aspect be still;
If one eye wounds so sore, two eyes will kill.
The more then Fair.
1.
BE more kind than you are,
Sweet love, or else less fair,
So shall I feel less care,
And you be no less rare.
To wound the heart.
Is beauties part;
But to restore
The lovesick sore,
Is to be more than saire
2.
If possible it were
Not to be what you ar^
Be more kind, or less saire,
Use lips, and eyes forbear;
Your smiles are Lures,
My eyes adore,
But lips implore:
The kind are more than fair.
The Beauteous are not fair,
those coyness breeds despair;
(...) those that freindly are,
(...) beauteous, though not fair,
Since to be kind,
A beauteous mind,
Does best explore;
Be kind therefore,
And be far more than fair.
No longer let my care
^nsume my love in air,
(...) kindness to me bare,
^^at I may say and swear
Os such as are
But only fair,
I knew before,
The world had store.
But you are more than fair
Bright eyes and smiles to bear,
(...) but a common wear:
(...) you without compare,
Will be as kind as fair,
And make me then
More blessed than men,
As far as ore,
Your sexes store,
Your self are more than fair.
Of Jonny and Jinny.
1.
THe pretty sweet Iinny sat on a Hill,
Where Ionny the swain her see;
He tuned his quill, and sung to her still,
Whoop Jinny come down to me.
2.
Though Ionny the valley, and Iinny the Hill,
Kept far above his degree;
He bore her good will, and sung to her still,
Whoop Jinny come down to me.
3.
But high was she seated, and so was she minded,
His heart was humble as he;
Her pride had her blinded, his love had him bended,
Whoop Jinny, etc.
4.
The mountain is bare, and subject to air,
Here meddowes, here shadows be;
There burns the Sun, here Rivers do run,
Whoop Jinny etc.
5.
All flowers do grace the vallyes greenface,
The mountain has none but thee;
Why will thou grow there, and all the rest here?
Whoop Jinny etc.
6.
Narcissus his rose, Adonis here grows,
That may thy examples be,
Since they be came slain, for pride and disdain,
Whoop Jinny etc.
7.
There Jinny keeps sheep, here Ionny will keep
Thy self and thy slock for thee;
If Ionny be worthy to keep thy slock for thee,
Whoop Jinny etc.
8.
But pretty sweet Iinny was loved of so many,
That little delight had she
To think upon Ionny, that thought her so bonny,
Whoop Jinny etc.
9.
Though Iinny thought ill of Ionny's good will,
Yet Ionny to Iinny was free;
He follows quill, and he hollowes her still,
Whoop Jinny come down to me.
A Song.
1.
O Love whose force and might
No power ere withstood;
Thou forcest me to write,
Come turn about Robbin hood.
2.
Her Cresses that were wrought
Most like the go^den sn^re,
My loving heart has caught;
As Mos did catch the Mare.
3.
Grant pity, else I dye,
Love so my heart bewitches,
With grief I Will howl and cry,
O how my elbow Itches.
4.
Tears overflow my sight
With Floods of daily weeping,
That in the silent night
I cannot rest for sleeping.
5.
What is it I would not do
To purchase one sweet smile;
Bid me to China go,
Faith I Will sit still the while.
6.
But since that all relief
And comfort does forsake me,
I Will kill my self with grief,
Nay then the Devil take me.
7.
Mark well my doleful hap,
Jove, Rector of the Thunder,
Send down a fiery clap,
And tear her smock asunder.
The Rhodomontade,
I Will tell you of a L^^t,
With ^ N^se live a Spout,
Which some c^ll a s^out,
And was so siout,
That he had often sought,
Full many about,
With many asc^^^,
And at'em would sh^^^,
Then put 'um to (...)
Nay beat '(...),
Though in a greet (...),
At men he would ^ront,
And at women (...),
His sood still was (...),
Which bred him the gout
He was a true trout
To good Alc when he mout
And did allways allow'^
This yo^ must not doubt
I Have heard him to vow't
As he went in and out.
And his Wife.
HIs Wise's name was Grace
And had a good Face
Yet had but little grace,
She Would kiss in any place,
Nay, to gather a brace,
Which some say is base,
And some did her ch^c^
Into a pitiful case,
She loved Cloves and Mace
He^ father cared the Mace
For the Mayor in a place
She still wears lace,
And will keep on her pace
When she (...) a race
For a very great space
She fishes with a dace
When she takes any place
When she dances she will race
She Will not ba^e you an ace
Of the truth of this she says.
The Son Jack.
Their sons name was Jack
Who was very black
And got many a knack
And seldom did lack
Unless Milk called la^
At Card^s he would pack
And was counted a qu^e^
Nay, bin brought to the rack,
For siring a (...)
Of corn, in a back
Side, like a mad back
Made's bones to crack
Nay sometimes to cack,
Till they gav^ him some sack
Nay, they h^ld him ^ack
And did him thwac^
And never did slack
Till he went to wrack,
Yet with his lips he would smack
And (...) is true of Jack.
The Daughter Nel.
Their daughters nams Nel
Who poor thing did dwell
Full long in a Cell
And there it was she fell
That one rang her knell
Being sallen into Hell
The devils to quell
And there I do smell
That she then did sell
Her ware very well
She made 'em to yell
And likewise to swell
So they writ on a Shall
A very great Spell
At long as an ^ll
That she bore (...)
For abusing in h^ll
She had no (...)
A'l this her self did tell,
And all d^ne by Nell.
A Song.
Come hang up your care, and cast away sorrow;
Drink on, he is a so^ that e're thinks of tomorrow:
Good store of Terse-Claret s^upplyes every thing,
For a man that is drunk is as great as a King;
Let no one with Crosses, or Losses repine,
But take a full dose of the juice of the Wine.
Diseases and troubles are nere to be found,
But in the damp place where the glass goes not round.
A SONG. The Tune, I Will go no more to the New Exchange.
NEver will I wed a Girl that is coy,
Nor one that is too free;
But she alone shall be my joy,
That keeps a mean to me;
For if too Coy, then I must court
For a kiss as well as any;
And if too free, I fear of the Sport
I then may have too many.
2.
Nelly a Girl was proud and coy,
But what good got she by it?
When they would a mind to kiss and toy,
Then she would be still unquiet;
For of the four or five she had,
They all have left her now,
Her impertinent tricks did make 'em madd
And so it would me, or you.
3.
Nanny was a Less that was too free,
And amorous withal;
She Would never with any disagree,
But ready at their call;
That some her freeness did impute
Unto good nature in her,
Others have said, without dispute
She Would prove a private sinner.
4.
Then for a Girl, that is not too free,
Or Coy, but at my call;
Yet handsome I would have her be,
And oblieging unto all;
That I may never say I have wed
A Girl that is starcht with Pride,
Or sool, or ugly, or ill bred,
I Would rather want a Bride.
An Invitation to enjoyment.
1.
COme, O come, I brook no stay,
He does not love that can delay;
See how the stealing night,
Has blotted out the light,
And Tapers do supply the day.
3.
See the first 'Tapers almost gone,
Thy flame like that will strait be none
And I as it expire,
Not able to hold fire,
She loses time that lies alone
4.
O let us cherish then these powers,
Whilst we may yet call them ours;
Then we best spend our time,
When no dull zealous Chime,
But sprightful kisses strike the hours.
The Rural Dance about the May Pole. The Tune, the first Figure dance at Mr.
Young's Ball in May 1671.
1.
COme lasses and ladds,
Take leave of your Dadds,
And away to the May Pole hey;
For every he
Has got him a she
With a Minstrill standing by;
For Willy has gotten his Iill,
And Ionny has got his Ione,
To jigg it, jigg it, jigg it, jigg it,
Jigg it up and down.
2.
Strike up says Wat,
Agreed says Kate,
And I prithee Fiddler play,
Content says Hodge,
And so says Madge:
For this is a Holliday.
Then every man did put
His Hat off to his Less,
And every Girl did curchy.
Curchy, curchy on the Grass.
3.
Begin says Hall,
I, l, says Mall,
We Will lead up Packintons pound;
No no, says Noll,
And so says Doll,
We Will first have Scllengers round;
Then every man began to foot it round about;
And every Girl did jet it, jet it, jet it in and out.
4.
You Are out, says Dick,
It Is a lie, says Nick,
The Fiddler played it false;
It Is true, says Hugh,
And so says Sue,
And so says nimble Alice;
The Fiddler then began to play the Tune again,
And every Girl did trip it, trip it, trip it to the men.
Lets kiss, says Jane,
Content, says Nan,
And so says every she;
How many says Batt,
Why three says Matt,
For that is a maidens fee;
Bu^ they instead of three did give 'em half a score,
And they inkindnesse, gave 'em, gave 'em, gave' em, as many more.
6.
Then after an hour
They went to a bower
And played for Ale and Cakes,
And kisses too
Until they were due,
The Lasses kept the stakes.
The Girls did then begin to quarrel with the men,
And bid'em take their kisses back, and give 'em their own again.
7.
Yet there they sat,
Until it was late,
And tired the Fiddler quite,
With singing and playing,
Without any paying
From morning until night.
They told the fiddler then they would pay him for his play,
And each a 2 pence, 2 pence, 2 pence gave him, and went away.
The unconstant Lover. (...) Tune, the second Figure dance at Mr. Young's Ball
May 1671.
NOw out upon this constant love,
I never was unto't inclined,
^ hate within that Sphere to move,
Where I to one must be confined.
^ love to range about, and gaze,
And often haunt the park and plays,
A purpose for a Mistress new,
Then bid the old one quite adue.
2.
For he is for me, and only he
That Is constant to unconst^ancie;
^ day or two I can approve,
But after that farewell to love:
^or every thing's to change inclin^d,
As Women, and the Moon, and wind*
^hen why not we as well as they,
Since they have showed us all the way.
^.
For constancy in Love is thought
To bring poor Lovers to their end;
^hen constancy in Love is naught,
When change brings every day a friend.
The constant fool is whining still,
But never can his fancy fill;
Whilst we can sing, and sport, and play,
And change our pleasure every day.
A mock to one that drank nothing but Water. The Tune, A lover I Am born, and a
Lover I Will be.
1.
FOr Bacchus I Am born, and for Bacchus I Will be
And wish from good wine I may never be free;
Let drinking abound, '^is wi^e makes the creature,
It strengthens the brain, and helps decayed nature;
For he that by ^^inking can turn the world round*
By Bac^hus and (...) deserves to be crowned.
2.
With health after health let the glass keep the motion
Till ^ make our brains dance like a ship on the Ocean
When our senses are pal'd, and our reason does fail
A little sound sleep will supply a fresh gale.
Then wi^h wi^e that is brisk, and a girl that is won
We Will drink, etc we will kiss, and we will never have done.
The Drinking Song on two Mistrisses* the one furnish^ th^^ with wine, and
^'other with money. The Tune, The Gang.
^.
COme boys, leave off your toys,
And trole about the sack;
We know it is good to cheer the blood,
And fortify the back.
^Tis that will make you fat,
And cherrish still the brain;
Nay studd the face with such a grace,
Like Rubies died in grain.
2.
Drink about, 'till all be out
The drawer will fill t again,
A ^Pox of the Watch, never shut the hat^h,
The clock has struck but ten;
Then a glass to the Jovial lass^,
That filled our pates with wine;
And here is another to the the other,
That furnished us with Coin.
3.
Come drink, we want no chink,
Hark how my pockets sound,
Away with it then, com^ ^oo't again,
Begin another round;
Then Jack, this Glass of Sack
Unto thy pretty Nell;
And here is to thine, this bowl of wine,
Dear Tom, thou love so well.
4.
Come says one, lets all be gone,
For our pates are thoroughly lined;
Y^^ he was banged, nay some say hanged,
That left his drink behind;
Then all, began to call,
Come drawer what is to pay?
Each took the cup, and drank it up,
And so they went away.
A Song.
1.
LEt Fortune and Phillis frown if they please,
I Will no more on their Deities call,
Nor trouble the Fates, but give my self ease,
And be happy in spite of 'em all;
I will have my Phillis, if I once go about her;
Or if I have not, I Will live better without her.
^.
If she prove virtuous, oblieging and kind,
Perhaps I Will vouchsafe for to love her;
But if Pride or Inconstancy in her I find,
I Would have her to know I Am above her;
For at length I have learned, now my fetters are gone,
To love if I please, or to let it alone.
A SONG.
1.
AS I walked in the woods one evening of late,
A Lass was deploring her hapless estate,
In a la^guishing posture poor maid she appears,
All swelled with her sighs^and blub'd with her tears:
She sighed and she sob'd, and I found it was all,
For a little of that which Harry gave Doll.
2.
At last she broke out, wretched she said,
Will no youth come succor a languishing maid,
With what he with ease and with pleasure may give,
Without which alas poor I cannot live.
Shall I never leave sighing and crying and all,
For a little of that which Harry gave Doll.
3.
At first when I saw a young man in the place,
My color would fade, and then flush in my Face;
My breath would grow short, and I shivered all over,
My breasts never popt up and down so before;
I scarce knew for what* but now find it was all,
For a little of that which Harry gave Doll.
A Song.
O The sad Day
When friends shall shake their heads, and say
Of miserable me:
Hark how he Groans,
Look how he pants for breath,
See see how he struggles with the pangs of Death;
When they shall say of these dear Eyes,
How hollow and how dim they be.
Mark how his b^est does swell and ^ise
Against his potent enemy:
When some old friend shall step to my beds side,
And touch my chill face, and thence shall gently slide;
But when his next companions say,
How does he do, what hopes? shall turn away,
Answering only with a lift up* hand,
Who who can his fate withstand?
Then shall a Gasp or two do more
Than e're my Rhetoric could before,
Persuade the World to trouble me no more, no more,
Persuade the world to trouble me no more.
A Song.
O Sorrow, Sorrow say where do thou dwell?
In the lowest room of Hell:
Art thou born of Humane race?
No, no, I have a furial face:
Art thou of City, or Town, or Court?
I to every place resort.
Why, O why, into the world was sorrow sent?
Men afflicted best repent.
What do thou seed on? Broken sleep.
What take thou pleasure in? to weep,
To sob, to pine, to groan,
To wring my hands, to sit alone.
When, O when, shall sorrow quiet have?
Never, never, never, never,
Never till she finds a grave,
Never 'till she finds a grave,
A Song.
Cheer up my Mate's, the wind does fairly blow,
Clap on more sail, and never spare;
Farewell all Lands, for now we are
In the wide Sea of Drink,
And marrily, merrily, merrily we go.
Bless me'tis ho^, another bowl of Wine,
And we shall Cut the burning Line.
Hey boys she sends away,
And by my head I know,
We round the world are sailing now.
What dulmen are those to tarry at home,
When abroad they may wantonly roame,
And gain such experience, and spy to
Such countries and wonders as I do?
But prithee good Pilot take heed what you do,
And fail not to touch at Peru;
With Gold there the vessel we will store,
And never never be poor,
No never be poor any more.
The foolish proud Lover.
1.
NOr Love, nor Fate, can I accuse of hate,
That my Clariada now is from me gone;
But I confess, it is my unworthiness
That I in sorrow thus am left alone:
I doated on her, and thought to 'a won her,
But woe is me I still must think upon her,
Which is the cause of all my smart;
She looked so pretty, and talked so witty,
None that ere I saw in Town or in City
Ere like her could thus surprise my heart.
2.
Had I set my heart, to have loved her but in part,
As only to enjoy her angels face,
Her curious eye, or cheeks of rosy die,
Or lip, or any one peculiar grace;
Butmy sad refusing one, must all be loosing,
O that I had used discretion in my choosing,
Then I might a lived, and not a died:
But like I^arus I by soaring up too high,
With his waxen wings so ne^e the Sun to fly,
Am justly punished for my foolish pride.
O you Powers Divine, I Will offer at your shrine,
If you will grant me this when I am gone;
That no punishment on her her may e're be sent,
The fault was only mine, and mine alone:
Also I do crave, this benefit to have,
That this Motto may be fixed upon my grave;
Here Is lies one by foolish pride was slain,
That who ere comes near may gently shed a tear
On my Hearse, and say, O 'twas severe,
So small offense should breed such mic kle pain,
On his Mistresse's Garden of Herbs.
HEarts-case, an he^b that sometimes has bin seen
In my Loves garden plot to flourish green,
Is dead and wit^er'd with a wind of woe,
And bitter Rue in place thereof does grow:
The cause I find to be, because I did
Neglect the Herb called Time, which now does bid
Me never hope, nor look once more again
To gain Hearts-case, to ease my heart of pain;
One hope is this, in this my wosul case,
My Rue, though bitter, may prove Herb of grace.
The Ita^i^n Pedlar.
1.
MAids see what you lack
Ere I open my pack,
For here is that will please you;
Do you dream in your beds,
Or with your Maiden-heads
Be you troubled, I will ease you.
2.
Is there any one among
These married men strong,
Has a head of his Wives making?
I have capps to be worn, that shall cover his ho^ne,
And keep his brow fro^^aking.
3.
Does any man mistrust, that his wife is unjust,
Or that she loves to be ranging?
I have that in my box, which excee 's Italian locks,
'Twill keep her Chaste: that is a strange thing.
4.
Is there any woman here, has bin married a year,
And not bin made a Mother?
I have that at my back, shall supply her of that lack,
And I Will use her sor't, like a Brother.
5.
I have fine Gloves for you and your Loves,
Bands, Handkerchers, and Laces;
And I Have Knots and Roses, and many pretty posies*
And mask* for your bad faces.
6.
I have sine bodkins to, that I can furnish you,
To keep your Coises from tearing;
And I have precious stones, ordained for the nonce,
Will delight you in the wearing.
7.
I have that wherewith if you well rub your Teeth,
They will look like Alabafter;
And powder for your hair, that will make you look fair*
I wender you come no faster.
Then come away, and do not stay,
For hence I must I tell you;
or when that I am gone, you will hardly find one
That such precious Ware can sell you.
In pra^se of the Black-Iack.
1.
BE your liquor small, or as thick as mudd,
The cheating bottle cries, good, good, good,
Whereat the master begins to storm,
'Cause he said more than he could perform,
And I wish that his heirs may never want Sack,
That first devised the bonny black Jack.
2.
No Tankerd, Flaggon, Bottle nor Jugg
Are half so good, or so well can hold Tugg,
For when they are broke or full of cracks,
Then they must fly to the brave black Jacks,
And I wish that his, etc.
3.
When the Bottle and Jack stands together, O fie on it,
The Bottle looks just like a dwarf to a Giant;
Then had we not reason Jacks to choose,
For this 'l make Boots, when the Bottle mends shoes,
And I wish etc.
4.
And as for the bottle you never can fill it
Without a Tunnell, but you must spill it,
It Is as hard to get, in as it is to get out:
It Is not so with a Jack, for it runs like a spout.
5.
And when we have drank out all our store,
The Jack goes for Barme to brew us some more;
And when our Stomachs with hunger have bled,
Then it marches for more to make us some bread,
And I wish etc.
6.
I now will cease to speak of the Jack,
But hope his assistance I never shall lack,
And I hope that now every honest man,
Instead of Jack will y'clip him John,
And I wish that his heirs may never want Sack,
That first devised the bonny black Jack.
A SONG.
1.
CAElia I loved thee
Though in vain you boast;
But since I have proved thee,
I find my labor lost,
Many may to love pretend;
But you will never find,
Seek country over, try any friend,
One half so true, so kind;
2.
Farewell unkind one,
Since you so design,
And see if ^ou can find one,
Whose love can equal mine;
If by chance you meet a man,
That may your fancy take,
Be wise, be kind, do what you can,
And love him for my sake;
Yet in your chiefest pleasure think
How my poor heart does ache.
3.
Each hour sporting,
Nothing can be more;
Each minute courting,
Like one ne^e loved before.
But should he forsake his nest,
And being wellfeather d fly
From you, to be another guest,
You Would sigh, and with me cry,
I loved, and was not loved again.
And so for love must die.
The Jealous, but mistaken Girl. To the Scotch tune also.
1.
Prithee tell me Phillis,
Why so pensive now,
I see that sadness still is
Fixed upon thy brow*
And those charming eyes
That were of late so bright,
In sighs and tears,
And other fears,
Have almost lost their sight;
Let this suffice,
I sympathize
With thee both day and night.
2.
Damon do thou ask it,
Thou art the cause of all,
Therefore do not mask it,
For thou have wrought my fall;
For I gave thee a Ring
Which thou have Coelia gave,
Our true-loves band,
It Was on her hand,
Which Ring thy life did save;
But woe is me,
Thy falsitie
Has brought me to my grave.
3.
Damon then began
On Phillis for to smile,
She called him perjured man,
And should no more beguile,
No my dearest Phill,
I blame thy Jealousy;
Our true-loves band
(...) my hand
Which thou did give to me;
And Coridon
Made Coelia one,
By that which came from thee.
4.
Long she sat ashamed,
And hid her bashful head;
Her jealousy she blamed,
And said she was but dead,
Unless that gentle Damon
Pardon this offense,
And let me rest
Upon his breast,
And there my suite commence;
I shall not doubt
To sue it out
Before I came from thence.
^.
Then he did embrace her,
And gave her kis^es store,
And vowed that he would place her
Where none was ere before,
That is, within his heart,
Which none shou d e're remove*
In spite of fate
Would be her mate,
And constant be in love,
And I say she
As true to thee,
As is the Turtle-Dove.
The Fair but Cruel Girl.
1.
THe Nymph that undoes me is fair and unkind,
No less than a wonder by nature designed;
She Is the grief of my heart, but joy of my eye,
The cause of my flame, that never can dye.
2.
Her Lips, from whence wit obligingly flows,
Has the color of Cherryes, and smell of the Rose;
Love and Destiny both attends on her will,
She saves with a smile, with a frown she can kill.
3.
The desperate Lover can hope no red^esse,
Where beauty and rigor, are both in excess:
In Coelia they meet, so unhappy am I;
Who sees her must love, who loves her must die.
The Bathing Girls: To the common Galliard Tune.
1.
IT was in June, and 'twas on Barnaby Bright too,
A time when the days are long, and nights are short,
A ^rew of merry Girls, and that in the night too,
Resolv^d to wash in a river, and there to sport;
And there (poor things) they then resolv^d to be merry too,
And with them did bring good store of jun-ketting stuff,
As Biscuit, and Cakes, and Sugar, and Syder, and Perry too,
Of each such a quantity, that was more than enough.
2.
But mark what chanc^t unto this innocent crew then,
Who thought themselves secure from any ear;
They knew 'twas dark, that none cou d take a view then,
And all did seem to be void of any fear;
Then every one uncas'd themselves, both smock and all
And each expected first who should begin;
And that they might stay but an hour, they told the Clock and all:
Then all in a Te-he-ing vain did enter in.
^.
But now comes out the Tale I meant to tell ye,
For a Crew of Jovial Lads were there before,
And finding there some viands for their belly,
They eased em then poor hearts of all their store;
Then every Lad sat down upon the Grass there,
And whispered thanks to the Girls for their good Cheer*
In which they drank a health to every Lass there,
That then were washing and rinsing without any fear.
4.
And when they had pleased (and filled) their bellies and pallats too,
They back did come unto the foresaid place,
And took away their Smocks, and both their Wallets too*
Which brought their good Bubb, and left them in pitiful case,
For presently they all came out toth' larder there,
That it put'em unto their shifts their Smocks to find;
I think, says one, my shift is a little farther there,
I, I, says another, for yours did lie by mine.
5.
At last, says one, the Devil a smock is here at all,
The Devil, a bit of bread, or drop of drink,
They Have took every morsel of our good cheer and all
And nothing but Gowns and Petticoats left, as I think,
At last, says one, if they would give us our Smocks again,
And likewise part of what we hither brought,
We shall be much oblieg d, and think'em Gentlemen,
And by this foolish example be better taught.
6.
Although in the River they were as many as crickets there,
'Twixt laughing and fretting their state they did condole;
And then came one of the Lads from out of the thickets there
And told 'em he would bring 'em their smocks, and what was stole,
They only with Petticoats on, like Jipsies were clad then,
He brought 'em their Smocks, and what he had promised before.
They fell to eat, and drink as if they would been mad there,
And glad they were all, they would got so much of their store.
7.
And when they all had made a good repast there,
They put on their cloths, and all resolved to be gone;
Then out comes all the ladds in very great have there,
And every one to the other then was known;
The girls did then conjure the ladds that were there,
To what had past their lips should still be seal^d,
Nay more than that they made 'em all to swear there,
To which they did, that nothing should be reveal d.
8.
Then each at other did make a pass at kissing then,
And round it went to every one level coile,
But thinking that at home they might be missing then,
And feared that they had stayed too great a while;
Then hand in hand they altogether marched away,
And every lad conveyed his Mistress home,
Again they kissed, then every Lass her man did pray,
That what had past, no more of that but Mum.
The unparalleled Lady: The Tune, 'Twixt Greece and Troy.
1.
When first I saw my Coeli'as face,
O how my heart was Inflamed with love;
I deemed her of no humane race,
But Angell-like dropped from above;
Her Star-like eyes with their Glim'ring glances
Then shined so bright,
Like the greatest Comet, when we look upon i^
'Till it takes away the sight.
2.
Her Nose is like a Promontory,
Which over-looks some pleasant place,
Her Cheeks like Roses in their glory,
And Teeth of Oriental race;
Her Coral lips, like the Cherryes when
They Are growing on the Tree;
But the greatest Bliss is,
Thence to gather kisses,
Would the cropp belonged to me.
3.
And underneath her snow-white neck,
There you may find an Ivory Plain,
On which two Crystal mounts are set
Tipped with a Ruby-fount in grain,
This is the place, which formerly was
Called the milky-way.
O that I might tipple still
At such a Nipple,
And forever there might s^ay.
4.
Her hands are of so pure a white,
That with the Swan they dare to vie;
But when upon a Lu^e they light,
Then you will hear such Harmony:
But when her voice and that together
Then play their parts,
You Would think the Spheres united,
And thither had invited
All, to Captivate their hearts.
5.
Her feet were so Epitomized,
Like peeping-mice did still appear,
That all the crew were then surpised
To see her dance a measure there*
She moved so well, you would think she had not
Danced then, but flown:
I would spend a Talent,
For to be her Gallant,
And call her still mine own.
The Politic Girl. The Tune The Duke of Mo^mouths Iigge.
1.
MY dearest Katy, prithee be but constant now,
And whatsoever is part, I shall forget I vow;
Do thou be kind, and give me but thy hand upon it,
And for my faith thou need'st not doubt or stand upon it;
I Will furnish thee with all the Cakes in season s^ill,
And whatsoever thou shall desire in reason still;
Nay more than that, thy Annal due I Will pay to thee,
And in all moderate things will still give way to thee.
2.
I must confess thy Pension came but flow of late,
Which is the cause I think that thou did change thy mate;
For when the Sinewy-part of love is took away,
We know the strength thereof will lessen every day:
But now thou know the Tide is turned my Bonny Kate,
My fathers dead, and we shall want no money Kate;
For he by Will has made me heir of all my dear,
That we no more in debt I hope shall fa^l my dear.
3.
Thou see how plainly now I Have told my mind to thee,
And also find'st that I will still be kind to thee;
What Remora then can stop the course of joining now
Our hearts and hands, come Katy no repining now;
She told him then, do you forgive but my past faults,
And I will likewise pardon all your by past faults;
He called her then his Mistress and his goddess to,
And then they joined their hands and lip's and body to.
4.
Thus have you seen this jarring couple now agree,
And all mistakes are now knit up in Amity,
She slighted all addresses he did make to her.
Because she found his purse could never speak to her;
But when she saw the Ginny birds to fly again,
She then resolved the knot of love to ^ye again,
And so 'twill last 'till all the birds are fled and gone,
Then march her self, and give it out she is dead and gone,
The Amorous Girl.
To the Tune of The crab of the wo^d.
1.
There Is none so pretty,
As my sweet Betty,
She bears away the Bell;
For sweetness and neatness,
And all compleatness,
All other Girls does excel.
2.
When ever we meet,
She Will lovingly greet
Me still with a how dee' do;
Well I thank you, quoth I,
Then she will reply,
So am I Sir the better for you
3.
I asked her how,
She told me, not now,
For walls had cares and eyes*
Nay she bid me take heed,
What ever I did,
For it is good to be merry and wise.
4.
Then I took her by the hand,
Which she did not withstand,
And I gave her a smirking kiss;
She gave me another
Just like the the other;
Quoth I, what a comfort is this?
5.
This put me in heart
To play over my part
That I had intended before;
But she bid me to hold,
And not be too bold,
Until she had fastened the door.
6.
Then she went to the Hatch,
To see that the Latch
And cranies were all cocksure,
And when she had done,
She bid me come on,
For now we were both secure.
7.
And what we did there,
I dare not declare,
But think that silence is best;
And if you will know,
Why I kissed her, or so,
But I Will leave you to guess at the rest.
The two virtuous Sisters: The Tune The Gun-steet.
1.
MY Cozen Moll's an arrant whore,
And so is her sister Kate,
They kicked their mother out o door,
And broke their Fathers pate;
And all because they craved a bit,
I mean a bit alone Sir,
For they with a bit would give 'em a knock,
That Is a bit and a knock, or none Sir.
2.
They Are cleanly too, I needs must say,
As any Girls in the town.
They sweep the house a new found way,
That Is once a quarter round;
So fine it is kept, that when it is swept,
I speak ^ in their defense Sir,
*Twill yield at a spur^, in dust and dirt.
Come fourteen or fifteen pen^^ (...).
3.
So fine and neat they dress the^^ meat,
I thought it alway^^ best
To let it alone, till all was gone,
And then to eat the rest;
For he that puts a bit in his guts,
And did but see the dressing,
No Physic could e're give a vomit so clear,
Which I think is a notable blessing.
4.
Some Whores are counted shifters to*
But they did hate 'em all,
They shift their Smocks with much ado
But every Spring and Fall.
They say it is good to cleanse the blood,
And think 'em worth the turning,
And when they are black upon their back,
They call it inside mourning.
5.
They will be drunk a little to,
I mean but twice a day,
They I swear and roar, and drink and spew,
And then they down will lay;
And so they will sleep, *till day gin peep,
Then call for more by dozens,
And to my friend there s now an end
Of both my dirty Cozens.
The beneficial wedding. The Tune, Phil: Porters dream.
ANd I have a mind to be married,
And so has you know who,
We both too long have tarried,
And therefore I mean to woe:
Then I did give her a Buss,
And she gave me a ring,
And so we bust, and kissed and bust,
And kissed like any thing.
2.
Her Grandsire gave her a Cow,
And her Grannam a Ewe and Lamb,
She said sheed suckle it too,
Until it had left the dam;
Her Uncle gave her a hog,
Her Aunt a Teeming Sow,
For Bacon and sowse, to keep the house,
And make em puddings enough.
3.
Her father gave her a Gown,
Her Mother a Petticote,
Which was of a mingl d brown,
The best that could be bought,
Her brother gave her a Cock,
And her sister a breeding Hen,
To tread and breed, and breed and tread.
And tread, and breed again.
3.
Her Cozen took a Care,
To give her a Rug was new,
His wife did give her a pair
Of Sheets and Blankets too;
But she had a special friend
That was a young Upholster,
You must not know the reason now,
Did give her a Bed, and a Bolster.
4.
A friend did give her a Wastcoat,
And Hose, and Shoes, and Hat,
Another did give her a la^'t Coat,
But it is no matter for that
So long as it is our own,
No matter how it come,
They keep her fine, and give her Wine*
But no more of that but Mum.
5.
Another did take her a house,
and pay d a Twelvemonths Ren^,
And furnis^'d me and my spouse
With what at the Wedding was spent;
Then we desired to know,
What trade we both should drive;
They said good Ale would never fail
If ever we meant to thrive.
6.
We both are ^itted now I think,
With store of household stuff,
And likewise cloths and meat and drink
As much as is enough;
But if we chance to want,
My Wife has store of friends,
Which I connive at, because they are private,
And so our Wedding ends.
A SONG.
1.
GEt you gone, you will und^ me,
If you love me ^on't p^^^ue me,
Let that inclination ^erish,
Which I dare ^o longer ^ errish,
Be content y'av^ won the (...),
'Twere base to hurt me, now I yield.
2.
With harmless thoughts I did begin,
But in the crow'd love (...)
I knew him not, (...),
So innocent, ^o full of play.
Is ported thus with young desire,
Cheered with his light, freed from his fire.
3.
But now his teeth and claws are grown,
Let me this fatal Lion shun;
You found me harmless, leave me so,
For were I not, you would leave me too;
But when you change remember still,
'Twas my misfortune not my will.
A SONG. Being an Answer to give over foolish heart, or were the Gods so
severe, and to that Tune.
1.
He Is a fool in his heart, that takes any care
Of Women's vain words be they never so fair;
Though she sigh and pretends unto Love never so long,
She Is double in heart, and betrays with her Tongue:
They still are as false as they were heretofore,
Their nature is such, they can never give it over.
2.
They would by their craft's of which they have store,
Inveigle men's hearts their looks to adore,
And if they once find they cannot prevail,
Overcharged with despite their faces grow pale;
There Is nothing that can their fancy please more,
Than to see foolish men their feature adore.
3.
They would by their frowns to observance persuade,
The men they do fancy their slaves they have made,
And to be sure they will Tyranize more,
If a man do but once their pity implore.
Why then should we men frail Women adore,
Since their pride is so great, and their pity no more,
4.
But sure all that Sex can never prove so vain,
To sport or delight in a true-lovers pain;
When a languishing eye in a Lover they view
To their cruelty sure, they must needs bid adieu;
Where good humor I find, I there will adore,
Say the world what it will, I will never give over.
A mock to the Song of Harry gave Doll, and to that Tune.
1.
AS I walk t in the woods one Evening of late,
A Girl was deploring her hapless estate;
^he sighed and she sob'd; Ah! wretched she said,
Will no youth come sucker la anguishing Maid?
Shall I sigh and cry, and look pale and wan,
And languish for ever for want of a man?
Shall I sigh and cry and look pale and wan,
And languish etc.
2.
Alas when I saw a young man in the place,
My color did fade, and then flusht in my face,
My breath wou d grow short, and I shivered all over,
I thought 'twas an Ague, but alas it was more:
For e're since I have sighed, and do what I can,
I find I must Languish for want of a man;
For e're since I have sighed; and do what I can,
I find I must, etc.
3.
In bed all the night, I weep on my pillow,
To see some Maids happy, whilst I wear the Willow,
I revenge my self on the innocent sheet,
Wherein I have often made my teeth for to meet,
But I fear it is in vain* let ^^e do what I can,
I must languish for ever for want of ^ man;
But in my despair, I Will dye if I can
And languish no longer for want of a man.
A Late Song.
1.
HOw charming are those pleasant pains,
Which the successful lover gains.
O^ how the Longing spirit flies,
On scorching sighs from dying eyes,
Whose intermixing rays impart,
Loves welcome message from the heart?
2.
Then how the Active pulse grows warm
To every s nse gives the allarm
But oh the rashness, and the qualmes
When Love unites the melting Palms!
What ecstasies, what hopes and fears,
What pretty talk, and Amorous tears?
3.
To these a thousand vows succeed,
And then, O me, still we proceed,
'Till sense and souls are bathed in bliss,
Think dear Aminda think on this,
And curse those hours we did not prove
The ravishing delights of Love.
A Theater Song.
I Must confess not many years ago.
'Twas death when e're my Mistress answear^d no;
Then I was subject to her Female yoke,
And stood or fell by every word she spoke;
But now I find the Intregues of love to be,
Naught but the Follies of our infancy.
2.
I can a Rich or handsome Lady Court,
Either for my convenience or for sport;
But if the one be proud or the other Coy,
I cannot break my sleep for such a Toy;
My heart is now for all assaults prepar d,
And will not be commanded or ensnared.
The new Song in Charles the eighth set by Mr. Pelham Humphrey's.
OH love if ere thou will ease a heart
That ownes thy power Divine,
And bleeds with thy too cruel dart,
Take pity now on mine;
Under thy Shades I fainting lie,
A thousand times I wished to die;
But when I find cold death too nigh,
I grieve to lose my pleasing pain
And call my wishes back again.
And thus as I sat all alone
In the shady myrtle Grove;
And to each gentle sigh and moan
Some neighboring Echo gave a groan,
Came by the man I love;
O how I strove my grief to hide,
I panted, blushed and almost dyed.
And did each tatling Ecchoe chide,
For fear some breath of moving air
Should to his ears my sorrow bear.
And Oh you powers, I dye to gain
But one poor panting kiss,
Glad yet I Would be on racks of pain,
Ere I Would one thought or wish retain
That honor thinks amiss:
Thus are poor maids unkindly used,
By love and nature both abused,
Our tender hearts all ease refuse;
And when we burn with secret flame,
Must bear our greifs, or dye with shame.
On his Mistress that loved Hunting.
1.
LEave Coelia, leave the woods to chase,
It Is not a sport, nor yet a place
For one that has so sweet a face.
2.
Nets in thy hand, Nets in thy brow,
In every limb a snare, and thou
Do lavish them thou car'st not how.
3.
Fond Girl these wild haunts are not best
To hunt: nor is a Savage beast
A fit prey for so sweet a breast.
4.
O do but cast thine eyes behind,
I Will carry thee where then shall find
A tame heart of a better kind.
5.
One that has set soft snares for thee,
Snares where if once thou fettered be,
Thou ^ never covet to be free.
6.
The Dews of April, the Winds of May
That flowr's the Meads, and glads the Day,
Are not more soft, more sweet than they.
7.
And when thou chancest for to kill,
Thou needst not fear no other ill
Than Turtles suffer when they Bill.
On a Scriv'ner.
HEre to a period is a Scriv'ner come;
This is his last sheet, full point and total sum
Of all aspersions, I excuse him not,
It Is plain, he lived not without many a blot;
Yet he no ill example showed to any,
But rather gave good coppies unto many.
He in good Letters always had been bred,
And has writ more, then many men have read.
He Rulers had at his command by law,
Although he could not hang, yet he could draw.
He did more, Bondmen make then any,
A dash of's pen alone did ruin many,
That not without all reason we may call
His letters great or little, Capital;
Yet it is the Scrivner s fate as ^ure as Just,
When he has all done, then he falls to dust.
On a Sexton.
I many graves have made, yet enjoyed none,
This which I ma e not, I possessed alone;
Each corpse withoug imbalming it did serve
My life like precious balsome to preserve;
But death then kind was, now cruel found I have;
Robbing me of life, without my living grave;
And yet 'twas kind still to, for in the grave
Where once I labor had, now peace I have;
I made good use of time, and night and day
Took care and heed, how th'hours go away,
I still was ready for a grave, nor shall
I grieve at what I most joy'd, a Funeral
As I was wont, no not so prone as then,
Out of the grave I shall arise again.
On a FART.
I Sing the praises of a Fart,
That I may do it by terms of Art;
I will invoke no deity,
But buttered Pease and Furmetie;
And think their help sufficient
To fit and furnish my intent;
When Virgils gnat, and Ovids flea,
And Homers frog strove for the day;
There is no reason in my mind,
Why a Fart should come behind,
Since that we may it parallel,
With any thing that does excel;
Musi^k is but a Fart that s sent,
From the guts of an Instrument;
The Scholar Farts, when he gains
Learning with cracking of his Brains,
And when he has spent much pain and oil,
Thomas and others to reconcile,
For to learn the distracting art.
What does he get by it? not a Fart;
The thunder that does roar so loud
Is but the Farting of a Cloud;
And if withal the wind do stir up
Rain, then it is a Farting Sirrup;
The Soldier makes his foes to run,
With bu^ the farting of a Gun,
That Is if he make the Bullets whistle,
Else it is no better then a sizle;
^ine boats that by the times about,
Are but Farts several Docks let out;
They are but Farts, the words we say,
Words are but words, and so are they;
Farts are as good as Land, for both
We hold in Tail, and let 'em both;
As soon as born they by and by
Fart-like bu^ only sing and dye;
Applause is but a Fart, the rude
Blast of the whole multitude;
And what is working Ale I pray;
But Farting Barme, which makes a way
Out at the bunghole, by farting noise,
When we do hear it is sputtring voice;
And when new drank, and without hopps,
It makes us fart, and seldom stops.
I more of Farts would write I vow;
But for my gutts I cannot now,
For now they wonderfully rumble,
And my stomach begins to grumble,
Which makes me think that Farts e're long
Will at my nock there find a Tongue,
And there sing out their own praises,
In thundering and in choking Phrases;
Where I leave them, and them to you,
And so I bid you all adieu.
What I have said take in good part,
If not, I do not care a Fart.
Silence the best Wooer.
1.
WRong not dear Empress of my heart,
The merits of true passion,
With thinking that he feels no smart,
That sues for no compassion.
2.
Since that my thoughts serve not to prove
The conquest of your Beauty,
It comes not from defect of Love,
But from excess of duty.
3.
For think you that I sue to serve
A Saint of such perfection
As all desire, but none deserve
A place in her affection.
4.
I rather choose to want relief,
Than venture the relieving,
When glory recommends the grief,
Despair distrust's th'atchieving.
5.
Thus the desires that aim too high
For any mortal lover,
When reason cannot make *em dye,
Discretion does them cover.
6.
Yet when discretion does believe,
The Plaints that they shall utter;
Then thy discretion may perceive,
That Silence is a Suitor.
7.
Silence in Love bewrayes more woe,
Than words though nere so witty;
^he beggar that is dumb you know
Deserves double pity.
8.
Then mis-conceive not, dearest heart,
My true though secret passion;
He smarteth most that hides his smart,
And sues for no compassion.
Beauty is not the guide to Affection.
OF Beauty there is no rule, neither can be,
Since that I like, pleases not him, nor thee.
One likes a dimpled Cheek, a double chin,
One likes a sparkling Eye, and so again;
One likes a lusty lass, to quench his fire,
Another, might he have but his desire,
Would reject all we have named before,
And nor double Chin, nor dimpled cheek adore,
Neither would care for Sparkling Eye a bit,
And reject Lustiness, but adore Wit;
One likes a Lady that is short, and small;
Another one perhaps that is big and tall;
You like a Lady cause she is very free,
I don't, for fear I should cornuted be;
One likes a Woman, for such, and such a grace,
One cares for nothing but a handsome face;
One loves to see flaxen locks hang down,
Another man delights in lovely brown.
Thus all men vary you do see, and now
Where Is the good man I pray that kissed the Cow?
FINIS.
