TO THE Kings most Excellent Majesty, THE HUMBLE ADDRESS OF Your most Loyal and
Dutiful Subjects of the City of Hereford.
May it please Your Sacred Majesty,
Since we are very sensible that no Age has ever yet produced any Prince that
has with more Justice, Goodness and Mercy, swaid the Scepters of the three
Kingdoms (Blessings which our Forefathers never had in a more eminent degree
of Perfection, and all other Nations never yet knew) We conceive it our Duty to
manifest to your Majesty and all the World our just value and grateful
apprehensions of the happiness we enjoy under the best of Kings and most
upright of Governments: And however some ill Men to accomplish their black
designs by attempting to subvert the Government, slily insinuate to the
credulous People, causeless Fears and false Jealousies of Arbitrary Power
growing upon us, yet the public Manifestations Your Majesty has at all times
given to your People of your Governing by the Laws of the Land and by no other
Method (which we find Your Majesty holds to inviolably and maintains as sacred)
keep us as safe from such mean apprehensions, as we are secure from the dismal
Effects of such a way of Government, which we have no cause to suspect unless
it be from those that suggest it, nor from them neither till they have
subverted a well tempered Monarchy, and introduced their beloved Tyrannical
Republic. We cannot but with all humble Duty Loyal Gratitude, and Excess of
Joy observe your Majesty's constant Endeavors to give Satisfaction and Ease to
the Minds of Your Majesty's Subjects, not only in Your strict Adherence to and
Favor of the True Protestant Religion, but more especially in Your late
Declaration, which cannot but stop the mouths of the Seditious and Factious,
preserve from Apostasy the Doubtful, and confirm the Loyalty of Your best
settled Subjects; And that Your Majesty may see that we are not poisoned or
likely to be so by any Seditious or Factious Designers, we do unanimously and
heartily Assure Your Sacred Majesty that we will stand by Your Majesty in the
Preservation of Your Person, Your Heirs and Lawful Successors, and the
Government in Church and State, as it is now by Law Established, with the last
drop of our Blood, and penny of our Fortunes; and shall be ready on all
occasions cheerfully to give You such large Assistances as (joined with the
proportionable Supplies of other Your Majesty's Loyal Subjects) may make your
Governmens Great and Easy to Your Self at home, and valued and feared by all
Your Allies and Neighbors abroad. We humbly beg Your Sacred Majesty to give a
Gracious Acceptance to the steady Resolutions of us Your most Obedient and
Loyal Subjects, which no Time, no Treachery, no Power, no Fraud or Faction,
shall ever make us Decline or Alter.

Your Majesty's most Humble, Loyal and Obedient Subjects and Servants,
