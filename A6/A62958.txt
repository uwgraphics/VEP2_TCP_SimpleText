The Tories Confession, Or, A merry song in Answer to The WHIGS Exaltation:
To the same Tune of Forty One.
[1]
A Pox on Whigs we will now grow wise
Let Us cry out guard the Throne,
By that we will damn the Good Old Cause
And make the Game our own
Religion, that shall stoop to us,
and so shall Liberty,
We Will make their Laws as thin as Lawn,
such Tory Rogues are we.
[2]
When once that Preaching Whineing Crew
are crushed and quite undone,
The Poor we will banish by our Laws,
and all the rest we will burn.
Then Abbey-Lands shall be possessed
by those whose Right they be,
We Will cry up Laws, but none we will use,
such Tory Rogues are we.
[3]
The Name of Protestant we hate,
the Whigs they know it well,
And since we cannot it longer hide
let us Truth genteely tell.
Now Dam me is good Manners grown,
and tends to Gallantry,
We Will (...) the Nation out of Doors,
such cursed Rogues are we.
[4]
What care we for a Parliament,
no Money comes from thence,
Would they but give us Coin enough,
would spend the Nations pence.
These two-penny Statesmen all shall down,
a glorious sight to see,
To finish all we will plunder 'um too,
such Sons of Whores are we.
[5]
We Will build more Universities,
for there lies all our hope,
And to the Crape Gown we will cringe and creep
supposing 'twere a Pope;
Say what he will we will him believe,
if true or false it be,
And while he prays we will Drink his Health,
such Tory Rogues are we.
[6]
What pimping Whig shall dare control,
or check the lawful Heir,
We Will take the Rascal by the Pole,
and Pox of all his Hair.
Then here goes honest James's Health,
come drink it on your Knee,
Dzowns we will have none but honest souls,
such Tory Rogues as we.
[7]
These Crafty Whigs are subtle Knaves
to give um all their due,
And yet we bauk'd the Popish Plot,
though they had sworn it true.
For this you know who we may thank,
But Mum for that, yet we
Are bound to pray and praise him for it,
such Tory Rogues are we.
[8]
When all these zealous Whigs are down,
we will drink and fall a roaring,
And then set up the Tripple Crown,
'twill Saint us all for whoreing.
When we have quite enslaved um all,
our selves cannot be free.
Then prithee Devil claim thy own,
for hey to Hell go we.
[9]
We Will choose their Sheriffs and Juries too
and then pretend it is Law,
We Will bring more Irish over to swear
against those they never saw:
We Will seize their Charters, then they must
come beg um on their Knee,
If this will not do we will call the French,
such cursed Rogues are we.
