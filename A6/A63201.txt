London, Printed by Thomas Mabb, 1659.

To the Right Honorable, THOMAS ALLEN, Lord Mayor of the City of LONDON.
My Lord,
ALthough I may seem a stranger to your Person, I am not so to your Worth and
Goodness, which have so generally spread themselves, they are rooted in men's
hearts and Affections: As the glory of a City, consists in the Prudence and
Magnanimity of her Governor; so she ought to be well read and acquainted with
his Virtues, whom she chooses. This begat such Acclamations of joy at your
Election; witness your Honorable Companies, and indeed (I may speak it without
Flattery) the Voice and Heart of the whole City; My Lord, these motives have
induced or rather encouraged me to make this my Address and Presentation, not
dispairing of your gracious Acceptance; since things of this nature have been
by use, partly made customary: However, I hope, the transgression (if any)
carries not so ill an Aspect, but that it may come within the Verge of your
Candor, whereby I may be licensed to subscribe my self,

My Lord, Your Honors most Humble and Faithful Servant, John Tatham.

TO THE Worshipful Company OF GROCERS,
THe Commons of Rome conceiving some distaste against their Senators, under
pretense of some great Oppression, did in a mutenous manner depart to the Mount
Aventine; but things being brought to a head, by Arguments of Reason and Power,
they were reconciled; And in memory thereof, they Celebrated their Games or
Tryumphs; It is also reported by Macrobeus that the Romans in the very heat of
of their Games Celebrated to Apollo; were suddenly invaded, and forced to
betake them to (...), and returning Conquerours, assisted by an unknown hand;
Clouds of Arrows and Darts, having covered their Enemies, they found an old man
dancing, and their sports in some manner continued, whereat with much joy they
uttered forth, Salva res est, saltat senex, which afterward became a Proverb,
and is properly spoken when a sudden evil is seconded with a good event,
beyond Hope or Expectation. Gentlemen, the inference needs little explanation;
it is sufficient Providence affords us that happiness to return to our Tryumphs,
the glory of the City, an encouragement to Arts, and an Obliger of,

Gentlemen, your humble Servant, JOHN TATHAM.

Indian with Banners in the hands of both: The Scene represents Commerce in
the figure of a young man sitting under a Canopy, supported by four figures or
young persons, holding Pendants and Sheilds in their hands, wherein is painted
the badges of the four parts of the world; his Lordship drawing nigh the said
Scene, Commerce salutes him in these words.

The first Speech.
MY Lord, it is thought the world was but a plain
Level, or Champion, whilst men did remain
In idleness, the Nurse of Ignorance;
Which lulls men's brains, in a Lethergean Trance;
At the last Necessity seemed to infuse
In them the Art of Arthitect, the use
Of Huts and Houses; every one began
To show himself or more, or less a Man.
Left their wild kind of living, and did build
Cities for safety, in the which they held,
A Civilized comunication, each
By a Divine instinct the Arts did teach;
Nor did they perish when the World was drowned
Their Hyrogliphicks were in pillars found,
That by degrees succeeding ages did
Reveal to one another secrets hid;
Which though before were seeds in them, yet they
Showed not until Experience taught the way.
Then did the Navigator search the Main,
How to steer forth, how to return again
With prize and safety? straight that art was hurld,
Into our lap, the center of the World,
By divine hand; that we in a short time,
Made our selves countrymen of every clymb,
Searching the spacious Universe, our skill,
And courage did the mouth of wonder fill,
Riding on dangers neck, as though it were meant,
We should be Lords of the whole Continent.
Such were our darings, that, what, Histories
Forget to speak of our discoveries.
Greenland, Lapland, Michar, Isles remote
And many more, which later times denote,
Unto our Countries glory, we made ours,
By the direction of foreseeing Powers:
Thus are we nourish't from the breasts increase;
Could we among our selves but mediate peace.
The ancient Poets Pyramids of praise,
Did to the Honor of their Countries raise,
In all my reading, or my travells (Sir)
I must our own above the rest prefer.
For as the Magnetique Courts, the Adamant
With her Simphatick faculty, the want
Of whose Assotiation makes her seem
Useless, regardlesse, as of small esteem:
So we from most parts of the Universe
Are sought, rather petitioned for Commerce.
Traffic brings profit, toward which they bend,
As though their welfare did on ours depend:
Thus do we (Sir) still by our patriots care,
Over take their riches at their full Carreire.
My Lord, you are Our Cities Hope, whereon
She does rely, her Father and her Son;
She gave you breath, and education too,
Which made you fit for what is conferred on you:
Then since the extention of Her love was such;
Your care of Her, cannot be shown too much:
Which, as she doubts not of, so we rejoice,
And celebrate Your Triumphs in Her Uoice.
The Speech ended, the Scene quits the place, and (hastening toward his
Lordships House) is placed in the rear of a Ship, not yet visible to his
Lordship, and his Lordship, the Aldermen and their attendants pass through
Cheap Side, and the Poultry; toward the Exchange they meet another Scean,
representing several of the places or Countries, in which the Commodities
belonging to the Grocers trade do grow, and the natives disporting therein, in
habits of each Nation; on one part of the said Stage is placed a Clove Tree, in
another a Nutmeg Tree and a Current Tree, on another part thereof is planted
Rice, Rasons, Figgs, and Druggs; and in the Front is placed or fixed a
Crockadile, with an Egyptian on his back, a banner in his hand, at each Angle
of the Stage a Nymph; when his Lordship draws nigh, the Egyptian salutes him in
these words:

The second Speech.
WHere am I? What auspicious wind conveyed
Me to this Isle? what sudden thoughts invade
My faculties? Egyptian darkness, hence,
I now discern the cause and the influence;
It was the soft and winning breath of Fame,
Fanning the way unto the honored name
Of him, that this days Tryumphs wait upon,
Wafted me hither, and has put me on
This bold attempt. My Lord, all Nations are
Bound to this Seat, and must Concenter here
In point of Traffic; other parts but stand
Like Marginal Notes, directing to this Land:
Or, as in times past Mercurie's Statues were
Fixed in highways by the hand of Public care,
To point at consequents, this little Round
Is in it self a World; Istmus and Sound,
Memphis no more of your feigned Rampires boast;
Lysbone your Tagus, Caria your Coasts
Persia, Scythia, Parthia, Thratia,
Lydia, Syria, Syberia, Caspia,
Ty up your numerous Glories, with your Tongue,
That heretofore the want on Muses sung;
For in this Inch of Earth's comprised more,
Than all the Poets fanoi'd yours before.
It is Our wishes ( Sir) your beloved Name,
May add a breathing to the breath of Fame;
To sound you Great and Good, that your just Fate
May fix you a firm Pillar to this State:
May You in Her, and She in You this year
Propitious be, as the Motion of a Sphere.
The Speech ended, this Scene likewise quits the place, and is conveyed through
Leaden Hall street toward his Lordships House, where meeting with the former,
is divided into two parts; that Stage whereon the Spaniards and Negars are,
being placed on the Right hand of Commerce, the Persians and Indians on the
Left, and the Griffins Flanking of each; In the Front is placed the Ship, and
on the Right wing thereof is the Crookodile placed, and on the Left a Camel,
with a Negar on his back, having a Pendent in the one hand, and with the other
takes out of his Dorcers* Cloves, Currence and other Fruit, and throws among
the people; and on the head of that Stage stands one in a Persian habit, with a
two Attendants, on each side: The several Scens thus placed, and his Lordship
with the Aldermen and their attendants coming nere, the Mariners presented his
Lordship wi^h this Song:

The Mariners Song.
SInce the ^pan^ reap,
By Hazard grows cheap;
And that we are now within Ken, boys:
Let Us cast Anchor here,
No City more freer,
To Harbor sueh Jovial Men boys:
Then merrily sing, and as merrily quaf't,
Let Us drink up the Riches of the World in a draught.
The Song ended, the Foot Marshal with his Company, and likewise the
Pentioners, being come nere to the Lord Mayors door, the Foot Marshal places
the said Pentioners in a single File, on the North side the said street, and
causes every man to hang his Target on the top of his Javelin, then opens
the remaining part of the said Company to the Right and Left, himself and
Company passes through, till they come to the Masters and Wardens, and then
Marches them, and the whole Body through that Intervail, placing the Master at
the Lord Mayors Gate, and the whole Body successively, on the Wing each of
other, before the said Pentioners, and the Drums, Fises, Trumpets, Ensigns,
Banners, and Streamer bearers, in equal divisions as a Front Guard before
them, who as the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and their attendants pass* do each one
perform his part; but the Lords being come nere, the Scenes being placed as
aforesaid, the person representing a Persian Merchant, makes his address in
this manner:

The third Speech.
My Lord,
THe European Traveller with Experienced Keys*
Open*d the Gate to his Discoveries,
Sh^wing the essential species of Commerce
The very hinges to the Universe.
The Egyptian seemed in his discourse to Treat
Of places, and for Trade made this the Seat.
And now my Lord to amplyfy what they
Before have spoke, the Candid winds this day
Set me on Shore, as though the Twins had known,
What Tyumphs to your Honor would be shown.
The Mariners their several voices rear
For joy they safely have arrived here;
And brought their Vessel to their wished for home
Laden with Eastern Treasure, Spice and Gum;
The Dulcid Trees, whose substances do bear,
Heart pleasing Synamon, Cloves, Mace Nutmeggs are
From famed Arabia brought, likewise from thence
Comes Casia, Myrrh, and precious Frankincense,
From Pharo Figgs; Zant, Currants; Maligo,
Affords you Reasons; Dates and Pepper grow
In other places; Sugar and what not
But brings a benefit unto this Spot.
The manner how they grow (my Lord) you will see,
In the perfect Figure of each branch and tree.
Then Sena, Rhuberb, China, Roots that do
Not only purify, but strengthen too,
Sarsaparella, Aggrick, then comes in
Storax, Aloes, Indico, Benjamin,
And hundreds more, that the Indies and the Streights
Heap in to add unto your wealth by freights,
As though the Company of which you are free
With your own Trade twisted Society
In their Commerce and profits doubtless so
And may that linck and firm affection flow
T'inrich this City, that the Nation may
Participate the comfort of this day;
For (Sir) the Causes our disturbance bred
Are now Composed, rage and fury fled
To their dark Celles; That by your light we move
The second Subject of Our Hopes and Love.
May to the addition of your Name and Blood
Be attributed all that fame speaks good;
That so your praises may like lines from hence
The Center, fill the worlds circumference.
The Speech ended, and my Lords and their company within the Gate; the foot
Marshall ranks the whole body as before; and placing himself and Attendants in
the Front, do lead toward Grocers Hall, and the Scenes or Pageants make what
haste or speed, they possibly can after them.

1.
FRom the Indies and the Streights,
We come with full freight,
To add to your Wealth,
Your Pleasure, and Health,
Ingrediences such,
Would puzle one much:
To search out their Natures, and define their Names:
For their growth, and their places;
Hard things, as the case is,
Ye must Travel further than the River of Thames.
2.
Your Currants from Zant,
When your Worships want,
Come flying as wood,
In Vessels so good:
And Reason you know
Come from Maligo;
Dates, Figs, Cloves, and Nutmegs, with Sugar and Rice:
Then Pepper and Ginger,
That Nose ^osting twinger,
Then (...) and mace (...) spice.
3.
Then Casia and Myrrh,
We next must prefer,
With fine Francking sense,
That does cost you pence:
Then sweet Bejamine
Does draw Storax in
With Seva, and China, and Rhuberb so good:
All the next I can tell a,
Is Sarsaparella
Which strengthens the body and cleanses the blood.
This was an Entertainment to the Committee Appointed for carrying on the
Charge of the whole business; and presented before them on Thursday night last
at Gresham College.

Although the Gentleman whose singular judgment designed and Modelled the
several Fabrics, Structures and Scenes of this days Triumph, desired to have
his Name concealed; I hold it a piece of prejudice to omit theirs employed by
him; In the performance thereof, as Capt. Andrew Dakers and Mr. William
Lightfoot, Painters: Mr. Thomas Whiting, Ioyner: Mr. Richard Clear, Carver,
each of them in their qualities deserving ample commendations.

FINIS.
