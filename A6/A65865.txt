An Epistle of Consolation from the fresh Springs of Life, and flowings forth
of the Fathers Love (through his Servant) as a tender Salutation extended to
the whole Flock and Family of God; even to the lowest of his Babes and
Servants, whose hearts are sincere and tender toward him: For their
encouragement now in these Suffering and Trying times.
By G. W.

O My dear and tenderly beloved Friends, Brethren, and Sisters, from the
greatest to the least in my Fathers family, who are raised up by the power of
an endless life, and begotten by the word of truth and life into a living faith
and confidence in him who is our Rock and Refuge in all trials, afflictions,
and sufferings which we are exposed to, and undergo for the testimony of
Righteousness and a good Conscience; unto you, even unto you who are partakers
of this heavenly Calling, and whose hearts accordingly are set with a holy
Resolution for the glory and honor of our God therein, is my heart filled with
love unutterable, which arises from the fresh Springs of Life and Consolation
made manifest from a living experience of the effectual power and work of God
which has given access into a heavenly habitation and Sanctuary wherein his
presence is enjoyed, in which the fullness of Consolation and Joy resideth for
the Righteous, and all such as wait upon the Lord our God in his own e^ernal
spirit of life and holiness, whose delight is to dwell with him in his
Mansion House, which we have access into through the new and living way, which
in the everlasting and unspeakable love of God in his own Son is now made
manifest, and the many veils seen through, by which this way and habitation was
hid from us, whilst our minds were alienated from the love and everlasting
light of the Lord God and his Christ; but now therein is life and Salvation
brought forth and come near to many, whose hearts are inclined toward him, and
set to seek the fountain of life: And it is not the power of darkness, nor the
enmity of the Serpent or old Dragon, nor the dark wrath of man that shall be
able to hinder, obstruct, or frustrate the Lord God in his proceeding in this
his great work of Righteousness, which by his mighty arm and power he will
carry on and prosper, to the perfecting his own praise in his people, and as he
has glorified his everlasting name, and Crowned his own seed with glory,
victory, and triumph through sufferings and tribulations, (which glory and
victory many in their own particulars are partakers of) so he will glorify and
renown his name and seed through those trials and sufferings, which yet remain
to be fulfilled amongst his faithful witnessess, servants, and people who are
called, and chosen, and faithful, being endued with the spirit, nature, and
properties of his Elect seed in which his soul delights, and with whom the
pleasure of the Lord shall prosper, and which shall out live the enmity, and
Reign over its Adversaries and Oppressors, though they (for a time) be
permitted to appear with a high hand, and the wicked so highly to lift their
horns up against the seed of the Righteous; and to attempt the rooting out of
the faithful from amongst men; yet we have no cause (in any of these things) to
distrust the Lord, or to be weakened in our confidence which he has raised up
in us; for he is with us who is mighty to save, and his care, mercy, and
tenderness is felt toward all that truly fear him, and obey his voice; and of
this I am a living witness, who from time to time upon the weighty
consideration, and feeling of the goodness of our God, and largeness of his
love to his people, have been and am filled with the sense of his presence and
unspeakable glory over all that which would oppress or hurt, which cannot enter
into the holy Mountain, and in that glory and life received, is my heart and
bowels of tender love enlarged toward all the upright in heart, who are come
of a holy right seed, and sprung forth from a noble Vine, and not only so, but
in ho^y confidence, and steadfast Resolution, are given up in the spirit of
life, wisdom, and power, and of the fear of the Lord, to follow him in the
faith, patience, and suffering of his own faithful and Elect seed, which you
that abide in, shall never degenerate from the nature and innocence thereof,
but know your victory and dominion therein over death and hell, where the gates
threeof shall never be suffered to prevail against you; for as in the faith and
obedience you are given up in his will who has called you, your habitation and
security stands in his name and power, to which the Righteous fly and retire
in all their troubles and tribulatio^s, which though they be many, yet so many
deliverances do they meet withal at his hand, who is our Rock and Refuge,
whose Salvation becomes as Walls and Bulwarks for the faithful.

Oh my dear Friends both in the City of London, Bristol, Hartford, Reading,
Colchester, and elsewhere in this Nation of England, who for the trial and
exercise of your faith and patience through many tribulations and sufferings,
and who more particularly at this day and time are under a deep trial and
exercise, [the power of darkness and its Instruments being permitted to afflict
you, and to break your harmless and innocent Meetings, and to hurry many of you
into holes and prisons,] and yet you retain so much tenderness in your spirits
toward God* and respect to his testimony and cause, that you dare not deny
him, but must confess him and his truth and righteous testimony and worship
before men, and for that cause have given your backs to the smiters, and
exposed your selves to undergo the deep sufferings or penalties, that men may
be permitted to inflict upon you; and even to give up your lives for a prey,
rather then the name of the Lord should be dishonored by you; Oh dear hearts
hold fast your confidence and resolution in the name and power of the
everlasting Jehovah, in whom is your strength and safety, and keep within, and
be retired in your minds when temptations or any discouragements would enter
you to weaken any of your faith, for in the light and power of the God of
Jacob, a safe habitation is known, out of, and above all the troubles of the
world, and the persecutions that we meet with in it, and in the secret pavilion
of the Almighty, and hiding places of the Lord, the oppressed that wait upon
him find a Refuge in the time of trouble, and therein do see over all the
blackness and darkness which has covered the Earth, in which the enmity
works against the righteous seed, and do know a sweet repose in their deepest
sufferings and trials, and that Wellspring of life is set open in them, which
makes all easy to them, and sanctifies every state and condition of what trial
or exercise soever they meet with for the name of God or his testimony; and
herein joy, and peace, and everlasting glory and triumph is seen and felt by
all the faithful and sincere in heart over all their oppressors.

And that all you sincere hearted and tender Friends, whose eyes are turned
toward your maker, and whose faces are set Sion-ward may be so retire in your
minds to the principle of truth, and so watchful in the light of the Lord, and
to enjoy a peaceable habitation and sanctuary in him in all your sufferings,
for this has my soul traveled, waited, and breathed unto the God of my life
and Salvation, and that you all may feel your establishment and security in the
life and Covenant of the everlasting God, and in the enjoyment of the true
Communion and fellowship of the everlasting Gospel, wherein every member of the
body in that Communion does partake of the living bread in the Fathers
Mansion House, and therein become one bread to the strengthening, refreshing,
consolating, and building up of one another in the most holy faith, which
works by love, and which edifies the whole body throughout, which all that
come truly to partake of and enjoy, it is neither persecutions, nor
tribulations, nor principalities, nor powers, nor thrones, nor dominions, that
shall be able to separate them from the love of God in Christ; neither shall
any Rent or Schism come within that bond of love or bundle of life, wherewith
such are bound up together; for they are such as have overcome by faith and
patience, and have offered up all to the will of him that has called them, and
their name shall not be blotted out of the Book of Life, but be confessed
before the heavenly father and his Angels, in as much as they have confessed
him and his Son, and held forth his testimony, and not been ashamed thereof
before men: And these are they that are so nearly related unto God in his own
likeness and heavenly Image, that they are his chosen* refined, and precious
Jewels, never to be forgotten by him, nor separate from him, for they are as
the Apple of his eye, and engraven in the Palms of his hands; and such a
Remnant our God certainly has in this Nation, in whom I have seen that which
my soul has traveled for, and which has been to my souls satisfaction, and
as one having largely felt the Lords presence, and still feeling the enjoyment
of the same, and his glory to be the Reward, as it is to those that minister
relief to the oppressed, and bread to the hungry, for which many can bless the
Lord on our behalf I find the same living faith and confidence remaining in me,
in behalf of the work of the Lord, and the prosperity thereof as ever; and this
is the work that he has made me and others of his faithful servants
instruments in, which is so far brought to pass and effected by his mighty
power, as all the powers of darkness hell, and death, shall never be able to
undo it, nor all the storms, trials, or oppositions that ever we meet withal
shall ever be able to disanull it, or put a stop to it; for it shall prosper
over the heads of all the adversaries and oppressers of the righteous seed; and
that testimony which we have stood up for in this Nation shall never be
extinguished, but be had in everlasting remembrance; and this has the Lord
sealed and confirmed unto my soul, so as its neither imprisonment, nor
exilement, nor death it self that I look out at; but as to what the Lord may
suffer in these things I commit to him, as knowing a life in that faith that
sees to the end of these things, and beyond the wrath of man and enmity of the
wicked, which so highly is at work in our days, as had not the Lord in a great
measure put a limit and restraint thereto it would have extended to the taking
away many of our lives, not only by that covertly way of hard imprisonment,
and lingering martyrdom therein, but also by speedy execution under pretense
and color of legal proceeding or justice (so called) on the persecutors part^;
and how far yet the Lord may suffer the enmity to proceed in that case against
any of us, his will be done; and that I commit unto him who is the wise God as
not being careful in it: but thus far I can say, That we must be willing to
offer up our selves unto the deepest and utmost trials, as required therein, to
hold forth our testimony for our further manifestation, and both the righteous
and the wicked shall be tried in their way, and our God has raised up a
remnant whom he has prepared and fitted to try those weapons and unrighteous
decrees that are formed against the righteous seed, and they shall be tried to
the utmost, and broken through; for no weapon formed against Zion shall prosper,
because the righteousness of her children is of the Lord, who must have the
glory in the deliverance of his own seed, and in the removing the rod of the
oppressor, and breaking asunder the bands and cords of the wicked, who have
taken counsel together against him and his anointed, whom he that sits in
the heavens has in derision in all their high and proud attempts against him
and his seed, and their unrighteous designs and consultations, which would
debar his anointed of his liberty in his people and followers; but the King of
Zion is set upon his holy hill, who shall rule nations with a rod of iron, and
break them as the vessels of a potter; for power shall be given him over the
Nations, and he shall lay Babylon utterly waste, and her noise, music, pomp,
and vain glory shall cease, in which she has rejoiced over the Saints and true
witnesses, and followers of the Lamb, and the slain in her the earth shall not
cover, but disclose her blood, when the indignation of the Lord breaks forth,
and his vials of wrath comes to be emptied by his Angels, and executioners of
justice upon the seat of the Beast (that has upheld Babylon in her
abominations, and them that have taken part with, and followed the Beast) and
persecuting spirit.

And our God is the same that ever he was to his own, and his promises fail
not, but are now a fulfilling: And therefore O thou seed of Jacob, and
offspring of Israel, whom God has chosen, fear thou not, nor be dismayed, for
I am with thee, says the Lord; I will strengthen thee, and help, and uphold
thee with the right hand of my righteousness, and all they that are insenced
against thee, and they that strive with thee shall be ashamed and confounded,
and shall be as nothing yea, they shall perish that war against thee: fear not
thou worm Jacob; but arise in the power of the holy one; for to thee it is
given to thresh the mountains, with thy sharp threshing instrument, and to beat
them small, and to make the hills as chaff, and thou shall rejoice in the Lord;
and those that come of thee shall take root, and Israel which prevails with
God shall blossom, and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit, and I
will be as the dew unto him; he shall grow as the Lilly, and cast forth his
roots as Lebanon, says the Lord: What though if men be suffered to persecute,
hurry about, exile, transport or transplant any of us who are of this seed; yet
they cannot hinder this from growing, nor the branches thereof from spreading
over Nations and Kingdoms, because our God has caused, and will yet cause his
own seed to take deep root among nations and people, and will root out the
uncircumcised before his plant.

And thou, O Zion, and Church of the living God and suffering seed, who have
laid thy body as the ground, and as the street to them that went over, that
thou might keep thy conscience clear, and not bow down thy soul for thy
enemies to go over it; the Lord thy God that pleads the cause of his people,
will give the cup of trembling and fury which thou have drunk of into the hand
of them that afflict thee; therefore put on strength and courage in the Lord
thy God, and shine forth in thy brightness and beauty; for he is with thee* who
has laid thy foundations with Saphires, and thy stones with fair colors, and
he will adorn thy dwelling, and beautify thy situation, as with the most
precious and pleasant stones, though thou have been as one afflicted and tossed
with tempests and troubles within and without, and whosoever shall gather
together against thee shall fall for thy sake, and the gathering of the people,
and the fullness of the Gentiles shall be unto thee, and the sons of them that
afflicted thee, and all them that have despised thee shall bow and bend before
thee.

O my dear friends who are come to a living faith concerning these things, and
to know that seed, in which all the promises of God are, yea, and Amen, dwell
and abide therein; and as you are called to bear a public testimony for God,
in order to the gathering of many unto the covenant of promise; so be faithful
in holding forth that testimony, though for it many be called to suffer in this
day of trial, and to offer up all for the sake thereof; yet the Lord being with
us let us go on in his name, and by him make mention thereof, and vindicate his
worship in spirit and truth* which we suffer for, and in the power, authority,
and counsel of God stand up for our just liberty therein before our
persecutors, and Judges, when we are called before them, and in the weighty and
feeling spirit of life, Friends to endeavor (when called before their
oppressors) to fasten something upon their consciences, for the innocence of
our Cause, and when any of them are tried in order to banishment, (or the like)
that they may be so kept in the fear and counsel of God, having their spirits
seasoned with his life, as they may be manifest in the consciences of both
their persecutors and spectators; and that it may be apparent that friends are
in the name of the Lord, which is above every earthly name (how great soever)
and that in this name of our God we walk and suffer for obeying him, and
assembling together singly and innocently in his way and worship, and suffer
upon an innocent and conscientious account whatever otherwise men unrighteously
pretend against us; and this our suffering shall preach, and the Gospel of the
Kingdom shall there through be witnessed and sounded forth to the gathering in
of many into the love of that truth which we have received, though some that
are unfaithful, and such as back-slide in heart shall be scattered and blown
away with the storm; but the faithful and upright, whose hearts are perfect
toward God, he will show himself strong on their behalf; and they that follow
the Lamb whithersoever he goes, who through great tribulation have their
garments washed in his Blood, and who abide in the Temple and habitation of the
living God, serving him continually therein, the storm shall not be suffered to
remove them, nor the heat to scorch them, but under the shadow of their souls
beloved they shall sit down in peace, and the Lamb shall feed them, and lead
them unto the fountains of waters; even so the Lord God encompass all you his
dear babes and spiritual off-spr^ng with the arm of power, and make you as a
wa^ered Garden, and surround you within the bounds of his salvation, and
confound your enemies, and make their evil designs and intentions void and
frustrate, that he alone may have the glory and pre-eminence amongst his people
in this his day.

From your dear brother and fellow sufferer who travels in spirit and waits in
patience with the suffering seed for Sions deliverance out of all her troubles,
and ren^wn over all her enemies.
