TO THE READER.
I Formerly published half a Sheet on this Subject, and having disposed of all
I printed, I found my self necessitated to Print more, to gratify those who
bought the Instruments of me, but considering with my self the scantiness of
that paper, I took the pains to write a larger which should be more effectual,
and as I hope will give better satisfaction. It Is confessed that there is very
little new in this (as in most other Books written now a days) but what may be
found among former Authors. My chiefest care herein has been to collect and
alter so that it might serve my present purpose. As for the Instrument it self,
being carefully made and graduated as is here described, I know of none for
Portableness, Universality, and exactness, that does exceed it, I mean with
respect to its finding the hour, whereby it becomes absolutely useful for any
Gentleman to carry in his pocket, or to rectify his Watch or Pendulum by it,
etc. I have endeavored to be as plain as possible for the sake of young
beginners, that the reading of this might Create in some a farther Inclination
to the Mathematics, which I heartily wish may flourish not only as they are my
Trade, and consequently it is my Interest to promote them, but because they are
of so great and general use and advantage to the Kingdom.

THE DESCRIPTION and USES Of the General HOROLOGICAL RING: OR Universal
Ring-Dyal.
1. Of the Name.
THis Instrument serves as a Dyal to find the hour of the day, not in one
place only (as most sorts of Dyals do) but generally in all Countries whether
Northern or Southern; and therefore it is called the General Horological Ring,
or Universal Ring-Dyal.

2. The Parts.
It consists of these parts, viz. 1. A little Ring and its slider to hang it
by. 2. Two circles which fold one within the other. 3. A Diameter a cross in
the middle. 4. To this Diameter there is another slider.

3. The Name of each part.
The names given to the parts are: 1. The little Ring and its slider is called
the Cursor of the Meridian, and is represented (figl.) by the letter Z. 2. Of
the two Circles, the outermost M M M M, is called the Meridian, and the
innermost Ae Ae Ae Ae, is called the Aequinoctial. 3. That which crosses the
middle noted with A A is called the Bridge, or more properly the Axis. 4 The
slider within it noted C is called the Cursor of the Bridge or Axis.

4. The Divisions on each part.
One side of this Instrument according to fig. I. is thus divided. 1. The
Cursor of the Meridian has but one division or Notch as at O. 2. One half of
the Meridian is divided into twice 90 degrees, which are again subdivided into
halfs, and these halfs are distinguished from the Degrees, by a shorter line,
these Degrees are numbered at every ten, from their middle O both ways, by 10,
20, 30, etc. to 90, and in these Degrees are the Latitudes of places reckoned
when you would find the hour of the day. 3. The Aequinoctial is divided into 24
hours, and each hour is subdivided into eight parts, viz. halfs, quarters, and
half quarters, and some of them have the hours divided into 12 parts, and then
every division stands for five Minutes of time, whereof 60 make one hour, these
hours are numbered with I. II. III. etc. to twice XII. from the two opposite
points in the Meridian where this Circle is fastened. 4. On this side the Axis
is divided into months and days, every division expressing 2 days, except in
June and December, at which time the alteration of the Suns course is almost
insensible for several days together, these Months are known on one side the
slit by these Letters, I. F. M. A. M. I. Signifying, January, February, March,
April, May, June, on the other side by these, I. A. S. O. N. D. for July,
August, September, October, November, December. 5. The Cursor of the Axis has
a little hole through it and a line a cross the hole, which line when it is
used is to be set to the day of the Month.

The other side according to figure II. has only the Meridian and the Axis
divided 1. The Meridian has a quadrant or 90 Degrees divided on it, whose
center is at H. These Degrees are again subdivided into halfs, and this I call
the Quadrant of Altitudes, it serving to give the Altitude of the Sun, by the
shadow of a pin, or such like wire, which shall be stuck upwright in the Center
or hole H. 2. The Axis on that side the slit D is divided into twice 23 and
numbered both ways from the middle O by 10, 20, etc and this is called the Line
of Declination, its use being to give the Declination of the, etc. On the other
side the slit R, are divided four hours and a half, which are again subdivided,
Numbered by IIII / 8 V / 7 VI / 6 VII / 5 VIII / 4 and this line is to show the
Sun's rising and setting at London, but because it is particular this Line is
left out in most Dyals. The Cursor on this side as on the other has the little
hole and a line a cross it.

Besides these divisions on each side, on the inside the Aequinoctial, in the
middle, is a Line upon which is graduated the 24 hours, and parts agreeable to
those on the side described in fig I.

Note that the Instrument thus made is general, and will serve wheresoever you
are, and therefore most proper for Seamen and those that Travel far. But for
such as shall use them about these his Majesty's Dominions, it will be
sufficient to have but one Quadrant of Latitudes graduated, and no more than 18
hours or thereabouts, viz. from 3 in the morning to 9 at night, and then the
Instrument may be afforded so much the cheaper.

Uses of the Instrument.
THe Principal Uses of this Instrument (although larger may be made to perform
many more) are as follows.
1. Knowing the day of the month to find the Suns Declination. 2. To find the
Altitude of the Sun at the Meridian and all Hours. 3. By knowing the Suns
Declination and Meridian Altitude, to find the Latitude of any place. 4. To
find the hour of the day. 5. To find at what time the Sun rises and sets on any
day at London or any other place lying under the same Latitude. 6. To find what
days and nights throughout the year are equal.


USE I.
To get the Suns Declination by knowing first the day of the month.
Explanation.
THe Sun moves not always in the Aequinoctial, but Declines from it sometimes
toward the North, and sometimes toward the South, every day, either moving in
it or in Circle parallel to it, this diversity of motion is called the Suns
Declination, now about the 10 day of March and 13 of September the Suns course
is in the Aequinoctial, and then he is said to have no declination, and from
the 10 of March to the 13 of September, the sun moves on the North side the
Aequinoctial, and it called his Northern Declination, also from the 13 of
September to the 10 of March his motion being on the South side, is called
Southern Declination. By this variety of the Suns motion, is caused the
diversity of Seasons and inequalities of day and night. Note also, that the
greatest declination on either side exceeds not 23 Degrees and. Now to find it,

The Rule is:
Slide the Cursor of the Axis to the day the month, and then turn it on the
other side, and the division crossing the same hole will show the Suns
Declination in the Line D. Note that the Axis may be turned without turning the
whole Dyal.

Example 1.
March the 10, I slide the Cursor to the day of the month, and turning the
other side, the division stands at O, which shows the Sun has no Declination
that day, but moves in the Aequinoctial.

Example 2.
April the 8, I slide the Cursor to the day of the month, and turning the
otherside, the division shows 11 Degrees to be the Suns declination on that day
Northward.

Example 3.
October the 20, the Cursor being set to the day, on the other side it will
show 14 Degrees. for the Suns declination on that day to the Southward.

USE II.
To find the Suns Altitude on the Meridian and all Hours.
Explanation.
THe Altitude or height of the Sun is the the number of degrees. contained between
the middle or Center of the Sun, and the Horizon or Circle which bounds our
sight, and the Meridian Altitude is its height every day just at 12 a Clock,
the Sun at that time coming to touch the Meridian. To find it,

The Rule is:
When the Sun shines slide the division on the Cursor of the Meridian to the
beginning of the Degrees in fig. I. marked with O, then turn the Dyal and stick
a wire or pin upright in the hole H, fig. II. and holding it by the little Ring
turn it gently toward the Sun, so that the shadow of the Pin may fall among
the Degrees in the Quadrant of the Altitudes, now the Degrees. whereon the shadow
falls is the Suns Altitude at that time, but to know the Meridian Altitude
you must observe the Suns height just it 12, now that you may be sure to have
it right make several observations just about 12, and the greatest is the
truest, for as the Sun all the morning from its rising grows higher and higher
until it comes to the Meridian where it is highest, so having past the
Meridian, all the Afternoon it grows lower and lower until it sets: Wherefore
the Suns greatest Altitude on any day is the Meridian Altitude for that day.

Examples.
degrees. m. March the 10 th. the Suns MeridianAltitude, at Londonwill be found by
the foregoing Rule to be 38 28 April the 8 th. 49 28 October the 20 th. 24 28
June the 11 th. 61 58

Now before I proceed further to show the uses, it will be necessary to explain
some terms in Astronomy, such as I shall here make use of, that the young
Practitioner may with more ease understand what follows.

1. Degrees and Minutes.
And first what is meant by Degrees and Minutes. All Circles according to
Astronomy are conceived to be divided into 360 parts, which are called Degrees,
every Degree is subdivided into 60 Minutes, every Minute into 60 Seconds, etc.
So that one Degree is the three hundred and sixtieth part of a Circle, and one
Minute the 60th part of a Degree, etc. Now the whole Circle containing 360
Degrees, the half must contain 180 degrees. the Quadrant, or quarter part of a
Circle, contains 90 degrees. so likewise one degrees. containing 60 Minutes, 45 Min.
are 3 quarters, 30 Min. are one half, 20 Min. one third part, 15 Min. are one
quarter, 12 Min. are one 5 part, 10 Min. are one 6 part, 5 Min. are one 12
part, etc. On the Meridian of the Dyal Fig. I. there are two Quadrants, or
twice 90 Degrees. graduated, one of which next N P is called the Northern Quadrant
of Latitudes, and serves for those places whose Latitudes are on the North side
the Aequinoctial, the other is the Southern Quadrant, and serves in South
Latitudes.

2. Meridian.
It is a great Circle imagined in the Heavens, lying directly North and South,
dividing them into two equal parts, the Eastern and Western, passing through
both Poles, and the Zenith and Nadir; to this Circle when the Sun comes at all
times it is noon or midnight, and note that every place has a several
Meridian, except such as ly directly North and South one from the other.

3. Poles.
The Poles are two imagined points in the Heavens opposite to each other, one
North the other South.

4. Axis.
A Right Line imagined to run from one Pole to the other, is called the Axis.

5. Zenith.
The Zenith or Vertex is the Point in the Heavens directly over our heads.

6. Nadir.
The Nadir is the opposite Point to the Zenith, it being directly under our
feet.

7. Equinoctial.
The Equinoctial is a great Circle imagined to run directly East and West, it
exactly crosses the Meridian, and lies in the middle between the Poles, and
divides the Heavens into two equal parts, the Northern and Southern, when the
Sun moves in this Circle, which is twice a year, the days and nights are of an
equal length throughout the world.

8. Tropicks.
The Tropicks are two lesser Circles dividing the Heavens into two unequal
parts, they are Parallel to the Equinoctial, and distant from it 23 degrees. 30
min. one on the North side of it the other on the South, these Circles are the
utmost bounds of the Suns Declination.

9. Latitude and Eleva^^^^ of the Pole.
The Latitude of any (...) is the Number of Degrees contained between the
Zenith of that place and the Aequinoctial, which Degrees are counted in the
Meridian, either on the North or South side of the Aequinoctial, according as
the place is situated. This Latitude is always equal to the elevation of the
Pole, which is the number of Degrees in the Meridian contained between the Pole
and the Horizon; thus those that live under the Aequinoctial are said to have
no Latitude, and those that live under the Pole, if any such there be, are in
90 Degrees. of Latitude; hence also it is manifest, that those places which are
situate directly East and West one from the other, have one and the same
Latitude.

10. Colatitude.
The Compliment of the Latitude is the number of degrees contained between the
Zenith and the Pole, which is also the same with the distance between the
Aequinoctial and the Horizon, or it is so much as the Latitude wants of 90 Degrees.
for subtract the Latitude from 90, the remainder is the Colatitude.

USE. III. By knowing the Suns Declination and Meridian Altitude to find the
Latitude.
The Rule.
If the Suns declination be North, subtract it from the Meridian Altitude, and
the remainder is the Colatitude, but if the Suns Declination be South add it to
the Meridian Altitude, and the Sum shall be the Colatitude, which subtracted
again from 90 Degrees. the remainder is the Latitude.

Example 1.
March the 10. the Sun has no Declination, and I find the Meridian Altitude at
London, to be 38 degrees. 28 min. therefore 38 degrees. 28 min. subtracted from 90 degrees.
the remainder is 51 d. 32 m. the Latitude of London, and by this we see when
the Sun is in the Aequinoctial, its Meridian Altitude is equal to the
Compliment of the Latitude.

Example 2.
April the 8. the Suns declination is 11 degrees. North and its Meridian Altitude
49 degrees. 28 m. now subtract 11 degrees. from 49. 28. there rests 38 degrees. 28 min.
which subtracted again from 90 there rests 51 degrees. 32. min. the Latitude
required.

Example 3.
October the 20. the Suns Declination is 14 d. South, and the Meridian Altitude
is 24 d. 28 m. then add 14 d. to 24 d. 28 m. the sum is 38 d. 28 m. which
subtracted from 90 d. there rests 51 d. 32 m. as before.

Example 4.
Thus if the declination were 23 d. 30. m. North and the Meridian Altitude 65
d. 10 m. the Latitude would be found to be 48 d. 20. m.

Example 5.
Let the Declination be 12 d. 15 m. South, and the Meridian Altitude 39 d. 40
m. the Lat. would be 38d. 5 m. Note that these Rules hold good only for finding
the Latitudes of such places as ly to the North of the Aequinoctial, for South
Lat. the contrary are true, for there if the declination be North, you must add
it as you do now when it is South, and if the Suns Declination be South, you
must subtract it as you do here when it is North.

And least it be thought troublesome to find the Lat. there is added at the end
of this Book a Table of the Latitudes of the principal Places in England,
Scotland, and Ireland. So that being near any of those places you may make use
of the Lat. of that place, for 10 or 20 miles in this case will make a very
insensible or no Alteration.

USE IV.
To find the Hour of the day.
NOte that although the Equinoctial fold up within the Meridian to render the
instrument the more portable, yet when you would find the hour, the
Aequinoctial must be drawn forth according to fig. III. and it is a little Ray
or speck of light that coming through the hole of the Cursor of the Axis
falls upon the line in the middle of the Aequinoctial and shows the hour.

The Rule.
First the Latitude being got by the foregoing Rules, or by the Table at the
end of this book, slide the division on the Cursor of the Meridian to it,
either in the North or South Quadrants, according as the place is situated.
Secondly slide the Cursor of the Axis to the day of the month. Thirdly open the
Equinox as far as 'twill go, which is just to cross the Meridian, then guess as
near as you can at the hour, and turn the Axis toward the hour you guess, that
the Sun may the better shine through the hole, and holding the Instrument by
the little ring so that it may hang freely, move it gently this way and that,
till the Sun shining through the hole you can discern a little Ray or speck of
light to fall upon the Aequinoctial within side among the hours and parts, now
the point in the middle line whereon the Ray falls is the true hour. A little
practice will make it very easy. Fi. III. represents the Dyal as it is when
you would find the hour, where the Cursor Z is set to the Lat. of London, 51
32. the Cursor of the Axis is set to the day being April the 8, and the
Aequinox is drawn open to cross the Meridian. Now when the Dyal is thus set,
and shows the true hour, the Meridian of it hangs directly North and South,
according to that imagined in the Hea ens, the point N P represents the North
Pole, S P Represents the South, the Cursor Z Represents the Zenith, and its
oposite point N represents the Nadir; the Axis lies according to that of the
World passing from Pole to Pole, the points of VI and VI in the Aequinoctially
directly East and West, and the middle line within lies according to the true
Aequinoctial in the Heavens.

USE V.
To find the Suns Rising and Setting.
NOte this line of Rising and setting is particularly for the Latitude of
London, or any other place, situated directly East or West from it, but it may
indifferently serve the whole Kingdom. Note also that the great figures stand
for the Rising and the other for the setting.

The Rule.
Slide the Cursor of the Axis to the day of the Month, then turn the other
side, and the division crossing the hole, shows the Suns Rising, and Setting in
the line R.

Example 1.
I slide the Cursor to March the 10, and on the other side it shows VI. and 6,
for then the Sun rises at 6 and sets at 6.

Example 2.
April the 8, I set the Cursor to the day, and on the other side it shows V.
and 7, which is 5 for the Suns Rising and 7 for its Setting.

Example 3.
October the 20, the Cursor being set to the day, on the other side it will
show the Rising to be at a quarter after VII, and the Setting three quarters
after 4.

Now having found the Suns Rising and Setting, you may likewife from thence
find the length of the day and night, for double the time of the Suns Rising,
and you have the length of the Night, and double the time of its setting, gives
you the length of the Day, as will appear by the three following Examples.

Example 1.
March the 10, the Sun rises at 6 and sets at 6, now twice 6 is twelve for the
length both of day and night.

Example 2.
April the 8, the Sun rises at 5 and sets at 7, now twice 5 is 10 the length of
the Night, and twice 7 is 14 the length of the day.

Example 3.
October the 20, The Sun rises at a quarter after 7 and sets at 3 quarters
after 4, now twice 7 and a quarter is 14 and a half for the length of the
Night, and twice 4 and 3 quarters is 9 and an half for the lenghth of the day;
in all which Examples it appears that both the sums of the length of the day
and night being added together will make 24, the hours contained in a natural
day.

USE VI.
To find what days and Nights throughout the year are Equal.
The Rule.
THe Days on one side the slit are equal to the days on the other.

Example.
Slide the Cursor to March the 10, and the day equal to it will be found on the
other side Sept. the 13, So equal to April the 8 is August the 14. And the day
equal to the 20 of October is February the Second.

Now these days are said to be equal each to the other, in these respects; 1.
in respect of the Suns Declination, it being on both the same. 2. Of the Suns
Altitude, for what Altitude the Sun has on any hour on one, the same will be
its Altitude on the same hour on the other. 3. The Time of the Suns Rising and
Setting is on both the same. 4. They are equal in length both of Day and Night.

How to place an Horizontal Dyal upon a level Plane, and to find the Meridian
several ways.
1. PRepare a smooth board or Stone, and place it truly Horizontal or level,
which may be done with such an Instrument as the Artificers call a Plumb-Rule,
or otherwise, then find the hour of the day by such an Instrument as is before
described, or by some other as true, or having a good Watch go to some Sun-Dyal
that you know to go true, and set the Watch by it, afterward turn the Dial
(which you are to place) about, until it shows the same hour with your
Instrument or Watch, and there fasten it.

2. Or having prepared your plain as before, near the middle of it set up a
wire which shall stand exactly perpendicular or upright, and the Sun Shining
clear, observe a little before Noon when the shadow of the wire is at the
shortest, and there make a point, and through that point and the center where
the wire stood draw a line, upon which place the 12 a Clock line of your Dyal,
and fix it.

3. And which is better, near the middle of your Plain choose a point as a
center, and thereon describe a Circle of a convenient bigness, and erect a wire
at Right Angles to your plain as before, then observe in the forenoon when the
shadow of the top of the Pin just touches the Circle, and there make a mark,
and again in the Afternoon watch when the shadow of the top of the Pin just
touches the Circle, and there make another Mark, then with a pair of Compasses
divide the space between those two Marks into two equal parts, and there make
a third Mark, through this last point and the center of the Circle where the
wire stood, draw a line and it shall be a true Meridian-line. This last
conclusion may be done with more ease, if there be several Circles described
one within another on the same center, also then you may make several
observations for the doing it with more certainty.

4. The Meridian may be found by the help of a good magnetical needle, well
made and fitted to a square Box, if in the useing of it there be an allowance
made for the Variation, the use of which is so plain, even to those that have
but seen them, that I think it needless here to treat of.

I shall set down only two ways more, which will require more knowledge in the
Mathematics than any of the Former, and so conclude. The first is in Dary's
Misscellanies, page 22, thus.

1. Let a piece of Metal or Wood be made a true Plain, then in some convenient
point thereof (taken as a Center,) erect a Gnomon of sufficient length at right
angles to the plain, this done, fix the Plain truly Horizontal; secondly if you
take the Suns Co-altitude (that is his distance from the Zenith) 3 several
times in one day, and according to the Stereographick Projection having a line
of Tangents by you set off from the center of your plain or foot of the Gnomon,
the Tangent of half each arch upon his respective Azimuth or Shadow (continued
if need be) made by the Gnomon, at that Instant when the Co-altitude is taken,
so shall you insert three points upon the plain. Thirdly if you find out the
Center to those 3 inserted points, then a right line infinitely extended by
this Center found and the foot of the Gnomon or the Center of the plain, is the
true Meridian line.

2. The other way, is by the help of the Suns Azimuth, and it is hinted in most
Books of Dyalling, thus, 1. Your plain being prepared as before, hold up a
string and Plummet, so that the shadow of the string may fall a cross an
assigned point in the plain, and in the same line of shadow make another point
at a convenient distance from the first, then through these two points draw a
right line, secondly at the same instant get the Suns Azimuth or Horizontal
distance from the south part of the Meridian, and having a line of chords by
you, set off the angle of the Azimuth from the assigned point, either on the
west side of the line drawn, if your observation be made in the Morning, or on
the east side if your observation be in the Afternoon, and draw the line.
Thirdly this last line so drawn shall be in the true Meridian.
