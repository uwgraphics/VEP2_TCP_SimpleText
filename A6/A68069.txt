MIDDLEBVRG. Printed by Abraham Schilders. M.D.C.xx.

FREDERICK, By the Grace of GOD, King of BOHEMIA, Count Palatine of the RHINE,
Elector of the Sacred EMPIRE, Duke of BAVARIA, Marquisse of MORAVIA, Duke of
SILESIA and LVXEMEVRG, Marquisse of the Higher and Lower LVSASIA, etc. TO ALL
Potentates, Electors, Princes, and States of Christendom, happy Greeting.
WE make no doubt, but all in general, residing either within or without the
Empire, do now sufficiently understand the miserable and most perilous estate,
into which the Kingdom of BOHEMIA is reduced, being so Famous for Antiquity,
and a principal member of the Sacred Empire, as also the Countries thereunto
annexed and Incorporated, with other bordering Provinces. Neither can they be
ignorant of such actions of Oppression, hostility, and violence, which have
been practiced within a little time, through continual Rapines, Murders,
Combustions, Deuastations, plentiful effusion of Innocent blood, violation and
rauishing, both of Wives and honest Virgins, dismembring of little sucking
Children, with many other inhumane, most Cruel, and Barbarous insolences. In
like manner the true source and original of all these evils, of what
afterward ensued, or may in future time accrue, most evidently appears and
is as clear as day, both by experience, and the ample Relations that have
been diverse times made thereof; that they who by their depraved Councels, and
suggestions, have been the means to precipitate the mightier sort, into present
danger and loss, are now themselves convinced, even within their own
consciences. And notwithstanding the success of these latter times, wherein
sundry opinions have been hatched, about the subject of Religion, may make one
clearly discern with his eye, and (as it were) touch with his finger, that
according to the verity of holy Scripture, and a Maxim heretofore, held and
maintayn'd, by the ancient Doctors of the Church, that men's Consciences, ought
in no sort to be violated, urged, or constrained; and whenever men have
attempted any thing by this violent course, whether openly, or by secret
means, the issue has been pernicious, and the cause of great and wonderful
innouations, in the principallest and mightiest Kingdoms, and Countries of all
Christendom: Yet so it is, The Jesuits.
that a certain extrauagant, and strange kind of people, having dispersed
themselves over Christendom, but especially within the Empire, and other
Kingdoms and Countries, bordering and depending thereupon, and having there
brought in, and planted a new Doctrine, absolutely funestall and obnoxious, to
all Potentates, and Magistrates: nay and further, having not only obtained
favor and access to great men, but also drawn to their own bent, both their
Councillors, and Officers, and generally the most Honorable, and opulent of
every place, through the false charm, of a counterfeit and masked Sanctity,
an implaceable desire and thirst, did meruailously grow and increase, of
persecuting all those, who were separated from the Roman Church, yea and
totally to extirpate them, if they did not yield, and come under that
Jurisdiction. Whereupon, it came to pass, that notwithstanding all the good
endeauours, that precedent Princes, and Governors have bestowed both in the
Empire, and more especially in the Kingdom of BOHEMIA, for preservation of
common Peace, and carrying an even hand between the adherents of the one, and
the other Church, conformable to the Concessions, and Edicts of pacification,
granted in favor of Religion: their Successors for all this (more through
others instigation, questionless, then of their own proper disposition) have
been urged so far, as to give a large field of leave and Liberty to these
pestiferous kind of people and their accomplices, who entering hereupon into a
full and main Careir, they presumed sometimes to innouate one thing, then
another, and not only by public writing to draw into doubt and controversy,
but also really to annihilate and make frustrate the said Concessions,
liberties of Religion, Pacts, Obligations and Oaths, solemnly assumed for
their confirmation.

But we will not here set down in particulers, what has been practiced for
many years since, and attempted in all parts of the Empire, upon the purchase
of this License and Lliberty; neither in how weak and instable manner,
affairs still continue and stand: referring our selves herein, to that, which
Time shall further manifest by sufficient trials and proofs, in whatsoever
shall be requisite and convenient.

But as for the Crown of BOHEMIA, and the Countries thereunto annexed, we
must no ways dissemble it, and it is very well known, that according as the
light of the holy Gospel spread his beams more and more from time to time, the
luster and repute of the Roman Catholic Religion, has there been wonderfully
eclipsed, not without procuring much trouble and strife: so that finally, it
most necessarily behooved to provide for the maintenance of common Peace and
tranquillity within the Realm, and this was effected by certain permissions
and Licenses, to prevent, that diversity of Religion might not wholly alter or
disturb a general and peaceable humane Society. So long as things remained
in these indifferent terms, both one and other party held themselves well
contented.

But those turbulent Spirits, of whom we formerly spoke, having no will to
consent to public repose and peace, they rather chose to hazard and reduce
things to an utter extremity, then to diminish the least tittle of that
intention which was so deeply graven in their hearts; which was, that all
things might come under the Popes spiritual jurisdiction, and at last, under
the secular Dominion of some strange and foreign government. All which added
more and more agrieuances and molestations to Religion. And above all the rest,
many plots were laid to frustrate the Royal Letters and Concessions of his
Majesty, to dimolish, or at least shut up, the Euangelical Churches, and
Temples newly built, to raise up thunderings, and threatenings amongst the
Estates, to interdict, and actually prohibit their lawful defense, horribly
to persecute the poor Subjects, with comminations of more terrible Oppression,
Insults, with loss of body, Life, and goods, besides sundry other in-iustices,
perpetrated against men of every several condition. And on the other side,
when natural and just resistance, opposed these insolences, or any other
means which necessity urged unto, as those Manifests published by the said
Estates can testify, they of the contrary party, in stead of referring their
cause to reason and equal hearing, proceeded further, by open hostility, and
force of Arms to such a point, that a good part of the said Kingdom of
BOHEMIA, and the Provinces Incorporate, remains now dismembered by Fire, and
Sword, being (as it were) turned into Blood, and Ashes. Whereunto, we might
also add, that whereas many years since, and especially the last past, the
said Kingdom, and Countries, have exposed their lives, and substance, for the
Defense and maintenance of the Crown of HVNGARIE, but above all other, of the
Frontier Fortifications, against the Forces of the Turk, a puissant, and
dreadful enemy to Christendom; quite contrary, and as it were, for an
accumulation of all evils, the said places were unfurnished both of Men,
Artillery, and warlike munition, that the same might be employed against the
Bohemian Nation, which was appointed, and ordained against the Turk.

Moreover, they have in the Empire, not only exacted that which remained yet
unpaid of the old Contributions against the Turk: but also under a special
pretext of the preservation and defense of the said places, in certain
Precincts and Provinces of the Empire, they have imposed new Subsidies, which
being obtained and Collected in a great part, it was no ways employed to the
pretended use, and end, but rather to the ruin and desolation of the members
of the Empire, and their dependances. By means whereof, one may see the
Vauntmure, and Bulwark of Christendom full of holes, and breaches, ready to
tumble and fall down. And this gave the HVNGARIAN Nation, sufficient warning,
to look to their own security and Defense.

We also suppose it is no less generally known, with what care, affection, and
love, how we and other Electors and Princes (yea and some foreign Potentates
likewise) by our exhortations and intercessions, have procured all the best
Offices possible, to quench and extinguish that fire, which daily spread it
self more and more in the said Kingdom, and to devise some means how to
prevent a greater disaster. And in truth, nothing would have been more pleasing
to us then to see those differences and oppositions accruing between Princes
and Subjects, soon appeased and ended by an Admission of the Estates of the
same Countries, to hear and determine therein, as heretofore the laudable and
commendable Custom was, and by us out of sincere and viscerall affection in
due time Urged and moved: by reason that the Intermission of remote Princes and
Potentates procured great loss of time, and very often augmented suspicion and
distrust.

But all present circumstances clearly manifest, what fruit or effect the said
aduertisements brought forth, seeing under, color of a suspension of Arms,
there has not only many Months passed over head, during which time, the
enemy has not ceased to forage and spoil; But moreover under shadow of
deferring it, to such an interposition, there has also a long space of time
slipped away: whereas in such dangerous and imminent cases, and when hostile
Actions are daily re-enforced, we ought effectually to make use of other more
expedite means to work a cessation, for it had bin imposible profitably to
have treated of any Accommodation, by way of Interposition, without first
stopping the course of the forementioned Hostilities, and setting down a
preualent, and validius security.

Besides all this (no doubt rather by the suggestions of some persons, who
having lost all hope of attaining their ends and scopes by lenity and
mildenes, aspired thereunto by way of Arms) they were negligent and careless,
to lay hold of the just and opportune occasion of re-establishing the Peace,
which after the death of the Emperor MATHIAS deceased, of laudable memory,
presented it self; in that they would by no means lend their ears, to the
wholesome counsel of good Patriots, nay of persons constituted in high place
and Dignity, to recover (as was most fit and requisite) alienated hearts, and
affections: but rather they made choice, to follow the directions of some
unnatural and disloyal Bohemians, and of others, either wholly strangers or
relying and hanging merely upon them. From hence it succeeded, that in stead of
real satisfaction and security, for that, where now they were so strictly
bound and obliged, nothing was offered more then promises, and Confirmations
in papers and writings. And by the same course, they labored to possess
themselves of the Kingdom by Arms, to overthrow the foundamentall Laws and
Privileges of the Country, to eneruate the observance of them, (though this
should be the only platform of all other obligations) to prostitute those
Countries, which have a prerogative of free Election, to the yoke of
governments Hereditary, and to conclude (at what rate soever) to compass
effects, conformable to their designs, and under color of punishing some few
nocents, to extirpate and destroy many thousands of Innocents. Wherein also,
they employed the assistance of strange Nations, very ill affected to all
Evangelical professors; of whom, a great number, and many thousands both Foot
and Horse, yea whole Regiments at a time, have marched through the Countries of
the Empire, (although, without consent of the Electors, the Emperor himself,
has no Authority nor power) to conduct them against the Estates of BOHEMIA,
and the Provinces annexed, for the wreaking of their evil affection, and to
enrich themselves, with their spoil.

But contrariwise, if too manifest a true intention to Peace, they had deposed
Arms from the beginning, removed the Authors of these troubles, provided for
the government of the Estate, by the advice and cooperation of the Provinces,
remidyed so many aggrieuances, restored the violated privileges, and taken
order for their observance, by means of a sufficient security, (without which
all other courses had been but vain) they might easily have wrought a Peace,
and diuerted greater alterations and changes. So far they were, from choosing
so expedient and requisite a way, that on the contrary, by extreme violence
they enforced the Countries to have recourse, to such a lawful and speedy
defense, as GOD and Nature allows them, to be their own deliuerers out of
these extremities; And to this effect, they erected a general Confederacy
amongst them, (but not without Royal permission for what passed) making
hereupon a new Election, for reducing the Estate, to a better order and
Government. Of all which things, the Estates of our Crown of BOHEMIA, and the
Countries incorporate, having presented the foundamentall causes and reasons,
to the eye and view of the whole world, by Deductions so ample and clear, any
one not transported with passion, but impartially waighing all the reasons, and
Circumstances, he may herein, easily and equally be able to yield a true
judgment and censure.

Yet in this place, we mean not to charge our self with such Inferences, much
less also in this respect, here to insert the rightes and immunities of the
Realm, as well in the point of Free Election, as otherwise: but in this case,
we refer all men, to the Information and Justification, which the Estates,
have diuulged and published.

True it is, that the Election of a King of Romans made not long since at
Franckfort, fell out at the same time. But so likewise, we very perfectly carry
in mind, that then we persuaded, what possibly we could, not to make too much
haste therein, but before all things, to take counsel, for the cessation of
Arms, and to appease the War, which now was kindled in so many parts:
causing our Councillors to intimate, how it was not reasonable, therein to
reject (as they did) the Deputies of the said States of Bohemia, but rather so
to sway and contriue in those Consulations, that by their means, the way might
be clear of the Interposition, which then had been propounded to them. Though
our good intentions therefore took no place, and that we were driven to let
the then present affairs to run their course: Yet in all our Acts and
Decrees, we expressly by our said Councillors reserved to every one, the
privilege to him appertaining, with solemn protestation that in nothing we
would prejudice the Estates of this Kingdom, causing a special care to be
had, of all that, which (according to the judgment of our own Consciences)
concerns the Liberty, and good of the Empire; Not as being hereunto invited
by any hope of particular profit, seeing then we had not the least apprehension
of such things as afterward ensued: but only in that we foresaw such an
alteration and change, as events have now made manifest and so greatly
desiring, that it might have been avoided and shunned.

Seeing therefore the Estates of BOHEMIA, and of the Countries annexed, in
their general Assembly, unanimously, and with one consent, have conferred
their Suffrages and Election upon our Person; We protest before GOD, and with a
clear Conscience, that we ever having lived content, with the Electorall
Dignity, and such Principalities, and Countries hereditary, as God imparted to
us, we never of our selves aspired to this said Crown: and much less attained
we thereunto, by any seductions, or stratagems, even as those Estates which
Elected us, may yield undoubted witness and testimony.

As likewise we had no reason, considering the tempestuous, and lamentable
Estate, of present affairs, but surely it had been far more acceptable to
us, to have seen the Peace of that Kingdom established, and withal, the
Imperial tranquillity, preserved, and aduaunc'd. For we duly weigh and
foresee, the Charge, Peril, and Care which will redound unto us, by the
continuation of Arms, deuastation of Countries, and other Warlike
Incommodities. And there is no question but those of riper judgment will
readily conceive, that to accept the offer of a Kingdom, standing in such like
terms, required a far more constant resolution, then to refuse a peaceable
Kingdom for which notwithstanding, some have been so highly extolled by
Hystoriographers.

Moreover we boldly auerre, upon the sincerity of our Conscience, that if we
could have found out any other assured means, which by our refusal thereof,
might incontinently have extinguished the heat of so disastrous a Narre, and
entertained and reduced the Peace public to his true State and existance, so
that the whole Empire might have been sufficiently assured and secured thereof:
the Honors and interests of this world, should little have prevailed with us,
but most cheerfully in this case, we had refused the offer to us made, and
freely employed our whole endeavor and power, to obtain the said mean, of a
general Peace. Neither did we precipitantly entrude our selves, unto this so
weighty and important an affair. For first, it was after an humble invocation
of the King of Kings, who gives and takes away Crowns to, and from whom he
thinks best, with zealous Supplication and Prayer (in all this) to direct and
govern our Spirit and understanding: And upon this, after having communicated
with our nearest and dearest Friends, maturely weighing and considering all the
circumstances; we sensibly felt and perceived in all this proceeding, the
miraculous assistance and providence of God, who, thereto put his helping and
omnipotent hand. Behold now therefore, why we neither could nor ought to oppose
herein, his divine and holy will: And so much the less ought we to refuse this
Impositio^, by reason we are absolutely persuaded in our own Judgment and
understanding, that the said Estates of the Crown of BOHEMIA, and of the
Countries thereto incorporate, had just cause and reason to attempt this
mutation, for the reestablishment of their liberty and most ancient right of
Election, which others went about absolutely to disanull and abolish, by diverse
stratagems and devices. And therefore this occasion is no less just, pious,
and commendable, then easy to be intimated and proved by plentiful examples
of Histories, both sacred and profane. In like manner, we seek not to
detain, or take away from any other, that which properly belongs to him, but
rather to maintain and defend those, which defend the right of Liberty, of
Privileges, of royal Grants and Letters Patents, for a free exercise of the
religion of the Gospel, and other obseruances, against an unjust and violent
oppression: and to Protect these noble Countries, and so many thousands of
innocent Persons from total ruin, so far as God shall strengthen our arm,
and enlarge upon us his Graces and benedictions: having undoubted hope, that
whereas our simple intentions aim in all this, neither at Voluptuonsnes, nor
pleasures, at Honors, or worldly riches; but only at the glory of God, the
comfort of the afflicted, the release of the oppressed, and at the consolation
of so many desolate hearts, whose deep sighs, sobbes and tears, urged us to a
feeling compassion, that God our high and sovereign Conductor will never
forsake, and abandon us, but that rejecting all vain thoughts and cogitations
of men, he will send down unto us from above, his benign assistance and aid,
with fit and requisite means herein, to execute the Arrest, and Decree, of his
sacred will, providence, and inexhaustible wisdom: wherein, if we should come
short of our duty, our conscience would not only be inwardly wounded, but
further we should wilfully draw upon our selves Gods Divine wrath, and
punishment.

Moreover also considering, that if we had refused this divine Vocation and
Dignity, we could not possibly have avoided (especially, with all those that
make profession of the Gospel) the imputation and blame, of so much blood
consequently shed, and of all the spoil and waste made in the same Countries:
As also if they of the contrary party, had attained to the end of their
designs (which was to suppress the Bohemian Nation) it would further mightily
have encouraged them, to employ both against our selves, and all the other
Evangelical Estates of the Empire, the Arms they had in hand, to effect that,
whereunto the boiling malice of their hearts, has hitherto excited them, both
covertly and openly, nay by written impressions, divulged and published, not
sparing little Infants, no not their own sometimes, nor illustrious Families,
with their Countries and Subjects, as their comminations have threatened in
diverse parts: Adding further, that if there had not been present provision
made, and that by a preualent means, for the Kingdom of Bohemia, and the
Countries thereunto annexed, which are one of the principal members of the
Empire, and as it were a ramper against all external Nations: they had been in
great danger to have fallen into a Strangers hand, and finally to have been
entirely cut off, from the body of the German Empire, or at least reduced to
such a Condition, that they must needs have bin the Authors of great
Inconveniences, directly prejudicial to the Electors, Princes, and States
Evangelical adjacent: These circumstances, I say considered, we could find
out no other more convenient way, then the present resolution we have
undertaken. Whereunto we were likewise obliged more nearly, by the Faith, and
fidelity which we owe to the sacred Empire, through the peculiar interest of
our Electorall Family, and Principality of the superior Palatinate, and by the
hereditary Alliances, which the said Principality from all Antiquity, has
held with the Crown of Bohemia: for Protection and preservation whereof, the
forementioned reasons to watch the more circumspectly, hoping that every man
well informed of the Truth, and free from all passion, will rightly judge of
our Actions, and no ways sinisterly enterpret them.

And this was the reason, why in Gods name, for the advancement of his Glory,
for the Comfort of the poor afflicted, for the preservation of common
prosperity, and Liberty, and other very important occasions, at the humble, and
instant request of the Estates of the Kingdom of BOHEMIA and the Countries
incorporate, diverse times reiterated, both by writing and Embassies directed to
us, as also by serious remonstrances to us intimated: that at last we approved
of the Election of our person unanimously made, and accepted the Crown, and
Government of the Kingdom of BOHEMIA, and of the Countries annexed. And to
this end, we together with the Princess of great BRITAIN, our dear Spouse,
have transplanted our selves unto this City of PRAGVE, where with the common
Consent and Assistance of the said Estates, we have been solemnly Crowned, and
with great popular applause, collocated in the Royal Throne, which God by his
omnipent arm, graciously confirm, and grant us this favor, so to begin and
continue our Reign, that the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, may still more and
more, be augmented in us, and our Subjects, and they happily, and long time,
maintained in true Peace and felicity.

So that once more we protest before God and the whole world, that from this
time forward, we are firmly resolved, not to persecute or molest, or suffer to
be persecuted, or molested any person whosoever, for matter of Religion, no not
they, which profess themselves to be of the Roman Church, neither to trouble,
or disturb them in the exercise of their Religion, so they live conformably to
the Laws of the States, Edicts of Pacification, Royal Letters, and to former
public Grants passed in favor of Religion. As to speak truth, a good number
of the said Roman Catholics within the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Provinces
annexed, have voluntarily exposed and offered themselves by Oath, and
Subscription, to that common defensive Confederation Instituted between the
said Kingdom, and Countries, and by yielding us their due homage, inclusiuely
have approved of our Election and Coronation.

We in like manner are determined, to device all expedient and possible means,
not only in short time, to recover by the grace of God, tranquillity and
Peace, in our Kingdom of Bohemia and the Countries annexed; but further
entertain, and plant, some better correspondicie between the Estates and the
Empire, and to prevent all other Iuconueniences, so that the said Estates,
each one in his particular, be mutually hereunto affected, and that no obstacle
be interposed, nor occasion given of greater troubles.

And that the sincerity of our intentions, may more manifestly appear, we
will ever have a care, by all possible means, to embrace Amity,
correspondencie, and friendly Intelligence with all Potentates, Electors,
Princes, and Estates of Christendom, but more especially with those that
border and confine upon us: We presuming no less of them, that they will
reciprocally testify the like to us, assisting us with their Counsels, and
performances, against all those who out of some contray Disseigne, would
hostilely attempt against us, our Kingdom and Country.

And therefore we request them, out of the same affection and love, which we
are ready to acknowledge toward every one of them, in all Offices possible
within our power, and upon all occasions, they may be presented: We finding it
fit and necessary, in the times wherein we live, to manifest and make known
the same to all men, by this our public Declaration.

Given in our Royal Castle at Prague the 7. day of November. 1619.
