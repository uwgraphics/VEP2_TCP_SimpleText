Fearful Prodigies IN ITALY, Seen near the city OF ROME, In the Air:

Between the Castle Angelo and the VATICAN.

Seignior TORRIANO an Italian here resident in LONDON, and by him faithfully
translated into English.

Mirabilis es, o Domine, in judiciis tuis.

Fearful Prodigies in Italy, seen near the city of Rome in the air, between
Castle Angelo and the Vatican.
Wonderful art thou, o Lord, in all thy works.
IT is not unknown to all the world, how that Scarlet Whore, which triumphs in
the blood of the Saints, that sits upon her seven hills, the sometimes Empress
of the earth* the City of Rome, has always endeavored to show it self the
fear of Antichrist the Pope, who by his perverting the truth of Christian
Doctrine, and exalting himself above the Princes and Potentates of the earth,
strives to extirpate Christ's little stock, it being their fathers good will to
give them a Kingdom. No marvel it is therefore, if the Almighty Power out of
the viols of his wrath, and the cup of his judgments upon that place, which is
guilty of so many fornications, idolatries, and bloud-shods, as in the sequent
discourse shall be manifested. On Christmas day, the day of the nativitie of
our Savior, stylo novo, about two of the clock in the afternoon, from that
hill which was anciently called Mons Tarpeius on which the Capitol, the
Temple, consectated to all the Heathen Gods, was sometimes situated, and now
the Church of Saint Marie de Monte major. In which is probable are committed as
many idolatries as were perpetrated in the other, was heard great and mournful
groans, as if it had been of people now departing this life; when on the
sudden, the air which was very clear and fair, the days in Italy being as
long in December as they are here in mid March; and the great Luminarie of
Heaven, the Sun, operating with as much vigor, was most stupendiously
darkened, lightning, fire and smoke ushering in a most hideous tempest of
thunder, which in those parts is very rare at that time of the year, by
reason of the thinness and purity of the air, unsubject to vapors, which
with dreadful bolts, as if it had threatened dissolution not only to Rome,
but to all the Nations of the world; Heavens Canoniers discharging their fatal
artillery on the mountain, with such speed and violence, that it seemed to
rent (as it were) with an earthquake, diverse flames of fire breaking forth
with strange eruptions out of the earth, as if it would have consumed the whole
City: the people in the mean time being in strange and terrible amazements,
thinking the day of doom had been come: the Popes triple Crown falling from
his head for fear, as I am certainly informed, and the Conclave of Cardinals
in mighty fear and perplexity, as it is conjectured; but that the Devil was
something too great in them, would have repented them of their sins. For after
the terrible flashes of lightning, with thunderclaps, and the like hideous and
fearful sounds, which endured the space of a full hour, the air began to
clear up, and the face of Heaven appeared as it were surrounded with a clear
shining light, and the noise seized, and a new one began, which was of a shrill
sounding Trumpet, after which came flying in the air from the North and from
the South, two dreadful flaming Dragons of huge and extended form: one of
them appearing to hover over Castle Saint Angelo, the Popes principal
Citadell, and the other over mount Tarpey. In the middle space between which
was seen the resemblance of a naked man, the prise for which (it should seem)
these infernal Combatants came thither to strive for: and so with huge
outcries and ghastly groans, which were plainly heard, the trumpets sounding
as it were a charge, the two winged Devils made haste to encounter one another:
the Dragon that came from the North, striving to self upon the man with
outstretched wings and Harpenian tallons; when presently the other Dragon from
the South came in as it were either to the naked man's rescue, or else with more
fury to devour him: at last, after diverse hovering and dreadful clashings
together with their scaly wings, which sounded a far off like dints of swords
upon steely Corflets, they furiously met, and like eager Faulkons, or incensed
Eagles, endeavored to plume one another in their rapinous tallons; the man all
the while casting forth pitiful sighs and heart breaking groans, as if he had
seemed to implore assistance from Heaven; and the testified spectatours, who
stood quaking with as much dread as humane frailty can do at such unwonted
spectacles. When after two or three gyres in the air (like angry Comets) the
Dragons seemed to all their viewes, just over the head of the man, to close
together, then could no man imagine the dreadfulnesse of the combat, Irish
Greyhounds with English Mastives, Serpents with Eagles, nay, two encountering
ships at Sea, seeming to be but modells of this conflict, sometimes one Dragon,
and sometimes the other having the better, and extending their scaly mouths to
devour that Phantome or Apparition of a man that hung in the air betwixt them,
and so joining together beak to beak, wing to wing, and body to body; two
cunning wrastlers never gave greater demonstration of skill then these two
Monsters by their embraces, striving to overthrow, not to support each other.
At last, after at least half an hours fight in this stupendous manner which
stroke at the beholders with an extremity of fear and amazement the Dragon
that came from the North, in all men's view seemed to have the better of the
conflict, the other with subtle and cunning turns, as it were, rather to
defend himself then offend his enemy, flying up and down the empty air,
whilst the other most violently pursued him: But as you have seen in the
races of horses, wherein the one at the beginning runs at an easy rate,
whilst the other is at his full careere and swiftness; yet at the end the
horse that kept a sober pace at the first, when the other is out of breath
outstrips him and gains the post, and with it victory: so as near as could be
conjectured went the business of the combat between these two Dragons; for
the Dragon of the North having by delays and juggling manner of fight recovered
breath, as Rams that retire to come on with the greater acrimony and
fierceness, most furiously returned to assault the Dragon of the South,
thundering upon his wings, which flagg'd like sails when they want wind, and
piercing his body with his cruel gripes; the other cast forth many a
lamentable outcry bewailing, as it were, his mischance, and making such a noise
as soldiers do that are vanquished, laboring with might and maine to
disingage himself from the gripes of his cruel adversary, who still laid on
fresh load, so that the poor Dragon of the South was in a most distressed
strait, and so striving with all his diminished forces, at last he got out of
the reaches and embraces of the Dragon of the North, and then like an ill-bred
Hawke, in a cloud of sulphurous lighning, turned tail and fled, the Victor not
offering to pursue him, in an instant he was vanished, leaving behind him such
an horrible stench as was enough to infect the whole Region; the conquering
Dragon in the interim giving forth many joyful shouts from his divellish
throat, and insulting triumphantly in his victory, made have toward his
incorporeall prey, the naked man, who was notwithstanding visible, and as it
seemed, sensible of his approaching ruin; for with dolorous clamours he gave
forth such skreekes as would have amazed the hardiest man living, and did so
stupifie the auditors, that what between their fears and the expectation of
the novelty, were in an agony and distraction; at last it was heard plainly to
pronounce in the Italian tongue, Roma, Roma, tua doctrina non s^ attuli
Catoloci, which is in English, Rome, thy doctrine is not altogether Catholic,
in which certainly that devil against his natural quality spoke truth. But to
be brief, this wretched, or least seeming wreched man, being now, as it were,
in the very jaws of death, the Dragon of the North being even ready to swallow
him up at a morsel, was heard in the air a very loud sound of d^^^s, neighing
of horses, and clangor of trumpets, when forth of a cloud to the North-west
appeared an army of aeriall soldiers in white garments, with red crosses in
their front before them, and marched with swift and furious approach toward the
Dragon, some of them shooting off Muskets, which were plainly heard, the fire
smoking in their pans, and the smell of the powder being smelt below in the
City* the Dragon no whit amazed at the multitude of a ailants, flew
courageously among the armed squadrons, and dealt a very deathfull dole amongst
them, beating down both horse and man with his scaly and impenetrable wings;
so that diverse of them were seen to drop down, as if they had fallen into some
other region of the air, and so were no more: but the other soldiers
courageously charging this cruel Dragon on all sides, who vomited up flames of
fire and sulphur, and at last with a hideous and fearful skreech, extending
its scaly wings, and so fell down into the empty regions of the air as the
slaughtered soldiers had done, and were seen no more, but left that cursed
and divellish smell behind him, that it seemed hell had belched up all his
vapors and infernal Lethean fogs, the army of celestial soldiers in the
interim compassing the poor shadow of a man about: and so in triumph with
Ensigns displayed, and Drums beating, departed with all the signs of victory
and triumph; immediately the air began to clear, and the Sun being just
ready to set, it being then about five of clock (the dreadful combat having
endured at least two hours) displayed his cheerful countenance, and the
Cardinals and Senators of Rome going toward their palacies in much amaze and
affright discoursing of the effect of this portent, and some of the Inhabitants
of good account going up to the top of mount Tarpey under the place where the
last battle was fought upon the Church-walls and the Churchyard, they found
diffused a great quantity of blood, which lay there like water on the tops of
the grass, and this they made evident report of to his unholinesse, who made
at it a mockery, and interpreted it according to his own divellish fancy, that
it portended the downfall of heretics, such as his Holiness terms all true
believers, that deny his heathenish Supremacy and Apostaticall tenants.

Thus have I sent you a true and brief narration of this terrible and
prodigious wonder, which you may confidently divulge and report for truth; and
so with my true respects to all our friends, I take my leave and rest,

Your Servant, Antonio di-Soft.
Ligorne, January 2. Stilo novo.
