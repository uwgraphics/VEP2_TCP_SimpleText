Of the Eclipses this present Year, 1668.
FOur Eclipses happens this Year, 1668. Two of the Sun, and two of the Moon.

The first of the Moon, and last of the Sun will only be seen of us in Britain.

That of the Moon begins the 16 day of May, about 2 hours in the morning, and
ends about 5 in the morning.

That of the Sun happens upon the 25 day of October, about the 12th hour of the
day.

The Plagues incident this year, are these: 1. The plague of Poverty, when a
man has not a penny in his purse, credit with his neighbors, nor a hole to
hide his head in.

2. The Plague of Discontent, when a Husband shall find cold cheer, and hot
words from a scolding Wife.

3. The Plague of Contention, when a Travailer has a long journey, a tired
horse, and little money.

4. The Plague of Marriage, when a woman possesses a husband that is very
poor, yet jealous: young, yet a choleric fool.

5. The Plague of Debt, when a man has much to pay, little to discharge, and
an unmercifull Creditor.

6. The Plague of Hunger, when a man sees or smelle good cheer, and has an
excellent stomach, but knows not how to get it.

7. The Plague of Ingratitude, when a man has much wealth, and no wisdom;
much coin, and no conscience; continual health, and no grace to return thanks
unto him that bestow it on him.
