The supplycacyon of soulys Made by sir Thomas More knight counselor to our
souerayn lord the King and chancellor of his Duchy of Lancaster.

Against the supplycacyon of beggars.

To all good Christian people.
IN most pytuouse wise continually calls and cries upon your devout cherite
and most tender pity / for help cu^fort and relyefe / your late aquayntau^ce
/ kindred / spouses / companions / play fellows / and fre^des / and now your
humble and unacquainted and half forgote^ supplyau^tys / pore prisoners of god
y^ sely sowlys in purgatory / here abydyng and enduryng y^ greuouse paynys and
hot cle^synge fire / y^ freteth and burns owte ye rustye and fylthy spots
of our sin / till y^ mercy of almighty god y^ rather by your good and
cherytable means / vowchesaufe to deliver us hense.

From whe^se if ye meruayll why we more now moleste and trouble you with our
writing then ever we were wont before: yt may like you to wit and understand /
that hitherto / though we have been with many folk much forgoten of neglyge^ce
/ yet has always good folk remembered us / and we have been recommended unto
god and eased / helped / and relieved / both by the pryuate prayers of good
virtuous people / and specially by the daily masses and other gostely
suffrages of prestys / relygyouse / and folk of holy church. But now sith
that of late there are sprong^ up certain sedycyouse persons / which not
only travail and labor to dystroy them by whom we be much helped / but also
to sow and set forth such a pestylent opinion against our self / as ones
received and byleued among y^ people / must nedys take from us the relyefe and
cu^forte that ever should come to us by the cherytable alms / prayour / and
good wurkes of the world: ye may take yt for no wonder though we sely sowlys
that have long lain and cried so far from you that we seldom brake your
sleep / do now in this our great fere of our utter loss for ever of your
loving remembrance and relyefe / not yet importunatly by^eue you of your rest
with cryenge at your ears at unseasonable time when ye would (as we do never)
repose your self and take ease / but only procure to be presented unto you
this pore book this humble supplycacyon of owrs / which yt may please you
percell meal at your leisure to look over for all sely sowlys sake: that yt
may be as an wholesome tryacle at your heart against the dedely poison of their
pestylent persuasyon / that would bring you in that error to wene there were no
purgatory. Of all which cruel persons so procuring not y^ mynysshement of
your mercy toward us / but the utter spoil and robbery of our hole help and
comfort that should come from you: ye very wurste and thereby the most dedely
deuysour of our paynys and heaviness (god forgive him) is that dyspytuouse and
dyspytefull person / which of late under pretexte of pity / made and put forth
among you / a book that he named the supplycacyon for the beggars / a book
indede nothing less intendyng / then the pity that yt pretends: nothing
myndyng y^ weal of any man / but as we shall hereafter show you / much harm
and myschyefe to all men / and among other great sorrow dyscu^fort and heuenysse
unto us your even christian and nygh kynne / your late neighbors and plesaunt
companyo^s upon earth / and now pore prisoners here.

And albe yt yt his unhappy book / does for our own perte towche us very nere:
yet we be much more moved to give y^ world warnyng of his venymous writing /
for the dear love and cheryte that we bear to you / then for the respect of
our own relyefe. For as for us / albeyt that the gracious help of your
pryour / alms deed / and other good warkis for us / may be the means of
relyeuyng and releasyng of our present paynis / yet such is the merciful
goodness of god / that though the hole world would clean forgete us / yet would
his mercy so remember us / that after temporal punysshement and purging here
he will not finally forgete to take us hense: and wypyng all y^ terys out of
our eye^ / translate us at sundry times as his high wysedom see^h conuenyent /
in to that eternal heavenly bless / to which his holy blyssyd blood has bought
us. But surely to you worldly people living there upon earth / not only for
this present time / but also for as long as this world shall endure: the
wreched maker of that ungracious book (whom god give onys the grace to
repe^te and amend) if folk were so fond to follow him / should not fail to
work / as well myche worldely trouble to every kind of people / as over that
(which most loss were of all) to bring many a good simple soul / for lakke
of belefe of purgatory / the very straight way to hell.

And the case so standing / there would we think no man dowte / but though
the man that made the book were well known among you and in hold also /
whereby his heyghnouse treason to god and y^ world dysclosed and declared by us
/ he might be in parell of exquysyte paynefull punysshement: yet we both might
and ought / rather to put him in the danger of his own demeanure / then for
the sparyng of his just correccyon / to suffer him abuse y^ people with his
pestylent writing / to the inestymable harm of the hole world in goodys /
body / and soul. And sith we so might of reason / and so should of cheryte
though the man were known and taken / how myche may we now more frankely tell
you all and nothing shall need to spare him / sith his book is nameles / and
so him self among you unknown and thereby owte of the parell of any
punysshement for his unhappy deed?

But for that both ye and he shall well perceive / that we desire but your
weal and ours by gyuyng you warning of his malice / and nothing entend to
procure his punysshement / which we rather beseech our lord of his mercy to
remytte: ye shall understand that neither is his name nor person unknown
among us / and therefore wemight well discover him if we were so minded. For
there is not only some of his acquayntau^ce and counseyll / whom god gave at
their death the grace to repent / comen hither to purgatory / nothing more now
lamentyng among us / then their cruel unkindness toward us / in geuyng
counseyll against us / to the making of that ungracious book / with infydelyte
and lakke of bylyefe of the pourgyng fire which they now find and feel: but he
is also named and bosted among us by that evil angel of his / owre and your
gostely enemy the devil. which as soon as he had set him a wurke with that
pernycyouse book / ceaced not to come hither and boste yt among us: but with
his enmyouse and enuoyuse laughter gnasshyng the teeth and grynnynge / he told
us that his peopyll had by the advise and cou^sayll of him and of some
heretyques almost as evil as he / made such a book for beggars / that yt
should make us beg long are we get aught. whereby he trusted that some of us
should not so sone crepe owte of our pain as we had hoped.

Wit ye well these words were heavy tidings to us. But yet because y^ devil
is wont to ly / we took some comfort in that we could not belyue him /
specially telling a thing so far incredyble. For who could ever have
thought that any christian man could for very pity have founden in his heart to
seek and study the means / whereby a christian man should think yt labor lost
to pray for all cryste^ sowlys. But alakke the while we found sone after /
that the falshed and malice of the man / preued y^ dyuyll true. For by some
that dyed sone after the book put forth / we have herd and perceived the
wreched contentys thereof / well and plainly declarynge / what evil spyryte
inspyred him while yt was in making. For albe yt that yt is so contryued / and
the wordys so cowched / that by the secret inward wurkynge of the devil that
help to dyuyse yt / a simple reder might by delight in the redyng be dedely
corrupted and venemed: yet if a wise man well warned / aduysedly will way the
sentence / he shall find the hole book nothing else / but falshed under
pretext of playnesse / crueltye under the cloak of pity / sedycyon under the
color of counsel / proud arroga^s under y^ name of supplycacyo^ / and under
y^ pretense of favor unto pore folk / a devil she desire of noyau^ce both to
pore and rich / priest / religiouse / and say man / prince / lord / and people /
as well quycke as deed.

He deuyseth a pytuouse byll of complaynte and supplycacyon / feigned to be by
the pore sykke and sore beggars put up to the king / lamentyng theryn their
number so sore encreaced / that good folks almoyse not half suffysyng to find
them mete / they be constraynyd heuely to dye for hunger. Then layth he y^
cause of all these pore beggars / both their encrese in number and their defaut
in fyndyng / all this he layth to the only faut of the clergy: namyng them in
his bederoll bishops / abbotes / pryours / deacons / archedeco^s / suffragans /
prestes / monkys / chanons / frerys / perdoners / and so^moners. All these he
calls mighty sturdy beggars and idle holy theuys / which he says has beggyd
so importunatly / that they have gotten in to their handys y^ third part of
all the realm of England / beside tythys / preuy tythys / probatys of
testamentes and offrynges / with mass pens and mortuaryes / blyssyng and
cursyng / cytyng / suspendyng and soylyng. Then cu^meth he pertyculerly to
freres: to whom he makes as he thinks a plain and open rekenyng / that they
reseyue by beggyng through ye realm yearly.xliii. thousand.iii.Cxxxiii.
pound.vi.s.viii.d. sterlyng. Then shewyth he that all this cast to gyther /
amounts yearly far above the half of the hole substance of the realm.
After this presupposyng as though he had prouyd yt that the clergy has the
half / he the^ to prove the two hundred part of that they have were more then
suffycyent for them: takes for his ground that if the number of them be
compared with the number of lay men / the clergy be not ye hundredth part: and
y^ if they be compared with the lay men women and children / the clergy us not
the^ the four hundred person of that number. And then entendyth he thereby to
prove and conclude / that sith they have as he says more then the half of all
to gether / and be them self not fully the four hundred part: therefore if
that better half that they have were divided into two hundredth parts / then
were yet one part of those two hundredth pertys as he thinks to much for them
/ specially because they labor not. After this he gathers a great hepe of
euyls / wherwyth he belyeth the clergy / to bring them in dyspleasure of the
king and hatered of the people. And lest men should any thing esteem the
clergy for the suffragys of their pr^youre in relyefe of us sely christian
sowlys in purgatory / to take a way that good mind out of good christian mennys
hearts / he laboreth to make the world wene that there were no purgatory at
all. Wherein when he has done what he can / then labors he to the king
for a license to rail upon the clergy: saying that there is none other
effectual remedy against them / but that yt might please the king to give
him and such other fre lycense and lyberte / to dyffame the clergy at their
pleasure among the people. For he says that if any of them be punyshed any
thing by the temporal laws / than they sore troble the laborers thereof by the
spyrytuall law / and then the heddys of the clergy do so hyghly more than
recompense the loss of their felows / that they may be bold to do the like
offense again at their pleasure. And for to prove that yt is always so / he
layth that yt has been so thryfe: and as yt shall after be showed he lies in
all three. The furste he layth that the bishop of London was in a great rage for
endyghtynge of certain curatys of extorcyon and incontynency the last year in
the wardmote questis. And for the second he laith that doctor Aleyn after that
he was punished by praemunire for his contempt committed against the kyngys
temporal law / was therefore by the byshoppys hyghly reco^pe^sed in benefyces.
And for y^ third he layth that Richard Hunne because he had sued a praemunire
against a priest for suyng him in y^ spyrytuall court in a matter determynable
in the kyngys court / was accused of heresy and committed to byshoppys pryso^:
where he says that all the world knowyth that he was murtheryd by doctor
Horsey with his complyces then the byshoppys chancellor. And that y^ same
doctor Horsey he says upon other mennys mouthis paid.vi. hundred pou^des
for him and his complyces: and after obtained the kyngys most gracyous pardon.
Wheruppo^ he says the captayns of the spyrytualte because he had faughten so
manfully against the kings crown and dygnyte / promotyd him forth with
benefyce upon benefyce to the value of.iiii. times as myche. And by these
ensaumples he co^cludyth there will no such punishment serve against the
spyritualte: and also who y^ justly punysh a priest by the temporal law / is
unjustly trobled again in y^ spyrytuall law. Whereof he would include that of
necessyte for a special remedy / the king must nedis grant a sicence to such
lewd felows to ^ayle upon the^. Tha^ comes he at last unto the deuyce of
some remedy for the pore beggars. Wherein he would in no wise have none hospytals
made / because he says that therein the profit goes to the prestys. What
remedy than for the pore beggars. He deuysyth nor desires nothing to be given
them / nor none other almoyse or help requires for the^: but only that y^
kyngis hyghnes would furst take from the hole clergy all their hole living
/ and then set them abroad in the world to get them wives / and to get
their living with y^ labor of their handys and in the sweet of their facys /
as he says yt is the commandment of god in the furst chapter of Genesis:
and finally to tay them to the car^es to be whyppyd naked about every market
town till they fall to labor. And then if these petycions were onys arauntyd
and parformyd / he shows many great co^modytees that would as he says ensue
theruppo^ / both to the king and the people / and to the pore beggars. Which
thyngys we shall ere we leave / in such wise repete and ponder / that your
wysdoms may consider and parceiue in your self / what good fruit would follow the
speed of his goodly supplycacion / whereof we have rehearsed you the hole some
and effect.

Trewthe yt is y^ many thyngys wherewyth he florysheth his matters to make the^
seem gay to the reders at a sodayn show / we leave out for the while / because
we would ere we come thereto / that ye should furst have the matter self in short
set forth before your eyes. And tha^ shall we peruse his prouys / and in such
wise consider every thing aparte / that we nothing dout but who so shall read
his worshypfull writing after / shall sone parceyue therein / floryshyng without
fruit / futtelte without substance / rethoryk without reason / bold babelyng
without lernyng / and wylynes without wit. And finally for y^ foundacyon and
ground of all his prouys: ye shall find in his book not half so many leuys as
lies / but almost as many lies as lines.

And albe yt we lie here in that case that about thexamynacyo^ and answeryng of
such a mad malycyouse book we have neither lust nor leysoure to bestow the time
/ whereof mispe^t in our life we give now an hard and a heavy reckoning: yet not
only the necessyte of our cause dryueth us to declare unto you the feebleness of
his reasons / wherewyth he would bring you in the case to care nothing for us /
beleuyng yt there were no purgatory / but also most specially does our charity
toward you / stir us to show you the myschefe that he myndeth to your self /
as well in that point of infidelyte / as in all the remnaunt of his sedicyouse
book. In answeryng whereof we would gladly let his folly and lak of lernyng pass
/ if yt were not more tha^ necessary / that all folk should parceyue his little
lernyng and less wit / lest simple folk wenyng him wise and well lernyd /
might unto their harm esteem his evil writing the better for their wrong
opinion of his wit and lernyng. As for his malycyouse mind and vntreuth /
there can no man look that we should leave unto wchyd / but he that would rather
the man were believed than answered / and would wysh his byll sped were yt never
so malycyouse and false.

For where he to deuyseth his introduccyon / as all his purpose should have a
great face of charity / by that he speaks all in the name of the pore beggars
/ this is nothing else but the deuyls dryft / always coueryng his poison under
some taste of sugar. As for us we trust there will no wise man doubt what
favor we bear to beggars as folk of their own felyshyp and faculte / and of
all whom / there be no where in the world nether so nedy nor so sore / and so
syk nor so impotent / and so sore in pains as we. And that so farforth that if
ye might se them all on the tone side / and but one of us on the the other side /
we be very sure that the world would pity one of us / more tha^ them all. But
although we be more beggars then your beggars be / as folk daily beggyng our
alms of you and them both: yet e^uy we not them as one of them does a another
/ but we pray and require you to give them for our sakes / whereby your gift
greatly cumfortyth us both. And they be also our proctours and beg in our name /
and in our name receive your money / whereof we receive both your devotion and
their prayours. So yt ye may be well assured / there coud be put no byll nor
supplycacyon forth for their aduau^tage / which we would in any wise hinder /
but very gladly forther in all y^ ever we might. But in good faith as our pore
brethern the beggars be for many causes greatly to be pytyed for their disease
and syknes / sorrow / pain and pouerte: so do we much in this case sorrow their
myshap / that they have not had at the least wise so much fortune / as to
fall upon a wyser scryuener to make their supplycacyon: but upon such a one
as under his great wylynes shows so little wit / that beginning with a cloak
of charity / does by and by no less dysclose his hatered and malice / than if
be nothing else had ente^ded / but to cast of yt cloak and set out his malice
naked to the show. Whyrin like a beggars proctour he goes forth so nakedly /
yt no beggar is there so bare of cloth or money / as he shows him self bare
of faith / learning / troth / wit or charity. Which thing as it all ready well
appears to wise me^: so will we make yt euydent to all men / taking our
bygynnynge at the declaracyon of his vntrewth: which one thing well perceived /
w^ll be suffycyent to answer and ouertorne all his hole enterprise. How be yt
we nether shall need nor do purpose to cu^ber you with rehersall and reprofe of
all his lies: for that were to long a work / whereof we fere ye should be weary to
abide the heryng. But of so many we shall pray you take pacyence while we show
you some / and such as for the matter be requysyte to be known / for as much
as all his proves be specially grounded upon them.

And furst to begin where he begins / when he says that the number of such
beggars as he pretends to speak for / that is as him self calls them the
wretched hyduouse monsters / on who^ he says scarcely any eye dare look / the
foul unhappy sort of lepers and other sore people / nedy / impote^t / blind /
lame and syh / living only of alms: have their numbere now so sore
increased / that all the almoyse of all the well dysposed people of the realm
is not half inowghe to sustain them / but that for very constraynte they
dye for hunger: unto all those wordys of his / were yt not that though we well
wist our self he said untrue / yet would we be loathe so to lay as a lie to his
charge any thing / whereof the vntrewth were not so plainly parceyued / but that
he might find some favorers which might say he said true: else would we
paradue^ture not let to tell him / that for a bygynnyng in these few words he
had written two lies at onys. If we should tell you what number there was of pore
syk folk in days passed io^g before your time: ye were at lyberte not to
believe us. How be yt he cannot not yet on y^ the other side for his part nether /
bring you forth a bederoll of their namys: wherefore we must for both our
pertes be fayn to remyt you to your own time / and yet not from your chyldhed
(whereof many things men forget when they come to far greater age) but unto
the days of your good remembrance. And so doing / we suppose if the sorry
syghtys yt me^ have seen / had left as great impressyon still remaynyng in their
hartys / as the sight makes of the present sorrow that they se: men should thynk
and say yt they have in days passed seen as many sykke beggars as they se now.
For as for other syknes they rayn not god be thanked but after such rate as
they have done in times passed. And the^ of the french pokkys.xxx. year ago
went there about syk / five against one yt beggeth with them now. Whereof who so
list to say that he sees it otherwise: we will hold no great dyspycyons with
him theruppon / because we lakke the namys of both the sides to make the trial
with. But surely who so shall say the contrary: shall as we suppose either say
so for his pleasure / or else shall it fare by his sight as folkis fare with
their felyng / which what they feel they whyne at / but what they have felt
the^ have more then half forgotten / though they felt it right late. Which
makes one that has but a pore boil upon his finger / thynk the grefe more
great / than was the pain of a great boch that grieved his hole hand little
more than a month a fore. So that in this point of the number of syk beggars
so sore increased so late / albeit we will forbere so to say to him as we
might well say: yet will we be so bold to deny it him till he bring in some
better thing than his bare word for the proof.

And in good faith if he be put to the proof of the the other point also / that is
to wit that for very constraynt those pore syk folk dye for hunger: we verily
trust and think he shall seek far and find very few if he find any at all:
For albeit that pore householders have these d^^e years made right hard shyft
for corn: yet our lord be thanked men have not been so far from all pity /
as to suffer pore impote^t parsons dye at their doorys for hunger.

Now where as he says that the alms of all well disposed people of this reame
is not half enough to sustayn them / and the well dysposed people he calls in
this matter all the^ that gives them almoyse / and he speaks not of one year
nor twayn but of these many yerys now passed / for neither be the number of the
clergy nor their possessions nor the freres alms in which things he lays
the cause why the alms of good people is not half suffycyent to keep and
sustayn the pore and syk beggars fro famyshyng / any great thing increased in
these x. or.xii. or.xx. years last passed / and therefore if that he said were
true: then by all these.x. years at the lest / the almoyse of good people has
not been half able to susteyn the pore and syk beggars from famyshynge. And
surely if that were so that in.iiii. or.v. yerys in which was plenty of corn /
the pore and syk beggars for lak of mennys alms died so fast for hunger: though
many should fall sik never so fast again / yet had they in y^ last.ii. dear
yerys dyed up of lyklyhod almost euerychone. And whether this be true or not we
purpose not to dyspute: but to referr and report our self to every ma^nys eyes
and ears / whether any man here of so many deed / or se so many the fewer.

When he has laid these sure stonys to begin the ground and foundacyon of his
byldyng with / that sore and syk beggars be so sore encreasyd / that the
alms of all the good people of this realm is not half enough to sustayn
the^ / and that therefore by very constraynt they daily dye for hunger: upon
them he lays a another stone / that the cause of all this evil is the great
possessyo^s of the spyrtualte / and the great almys given to the frerys. But
herein furst he layth that besydys tithes and all such other profettes as rise
unto the chyrh by reason of the spyrytuall law or of mennys devotion / that
they have the third part of all the temporal lands of the realm. Which who
so can tell as much of the reuenews of the realm as he can tell little that
made the book / does well know that though they have much: yet is the third
part of all far an other thing / and y^ he says in this point vn^r^w. Than
goes he to the pore frerys. And there as we told you he shewyth that y^ alms
given them / of certeynte amounts yearly unto.x.iii. thousand.CCC.xxxiii.li.
vis.s.viii.d. sterlyng: paraduenture men would wene the man were some apostata /
and that he never coud be so pryuy to the frerys reconyng / but if he had been
long their lymytour / and seen some general vyew of all their hole accountys.
But surely sith the man is bad enough beside / we would be loath folk should reke^
him for apostata / for surely he was never friar for aught tha. we know / for
we never wist that ever in his life he was half so well dysposed. And also when
ye here the ground of his reconyng: ye well your self thynk that he nether
knows much of their matters / and of all the realm beside make as though he
knew many thyngys for true / which many men know for falls. For furst he puts
for the ground of his rekenyng that there are in the realm / two and fyfty
thousa^de parysh churches / which is one plain lie to begin with Then he
puts yt every paryshe one with a another / has ten house holds in yt:
meaning beside such pore howses as rather ask alms the^ give / for of such
ye wot well y^ frerys get no quarterag. and y^ point albe yt the ground be
not sure / yet because yt may to many men seem lykely / therefore we let yt
pass. But then he shows ferther for a sure troth a thing that all men
know surely for a great lie: that is to say that of every howsholde in every
paryshe / every of y^ five ordres of freres has every quarter a penny: for we
know full well and so do many of you to / first yt the comen people speak but
of.iiii. ordres / the white / the blakke / the austayne / and the gray / and
which is the fyft in many parts of the realm few folk can tell you. For if
the questyone were asked abowte / there would be peradventure founden many mo
the more pity it is / that could name you the grene freris then the crowched.
ye know right well also that in many a paryshe in england / of forty
howseholders ye shall not find four pay neither.v. pe^se a quarter nor.iiii.
another / and many a parysshe never a penny. And as for the.v.d. quarterly / we
dare boldly say that ye shall find yt paid in very few paryshes through the
realm / if ye find yt paid in any. And yet this thing being such a stark
lie as many men all ready knows / and every man shortly may find it / he
puts as a plain well known troth for a special post to bear up his
reckoning. For upon these growndes now makes he a clear reckoning in this
manner ensuynge / which is good also to be known for folk that will lern to
cast aco^pt. There be.lii.M. peryshes and in each of them.x. howsholdes So have
ye the hole some of the howsholdes.v. hundred thousand and twenty thowsande.
Even just Go now to the money then. Every order of the.v. orders of freres
has of every of these howsholdes a penny a quarter Su^ma for every house
among all the.v. orders every quarter.v. d. and here by may ye learn that five
times one makes.v. Now this is he shows you among the.v. orders of every
house for the hole year.xx.d. and so learn ye there that.iiii. times five
makes.xx. Su^ma says he.v. hondreth thowsande and.xx. thousand quarters of
angels. Here we would not that because the realm has no coin called the
quarter angel / ye should therefore so far mystake the man as to wene that
he meant so many quarter sackes of angels. For in deed (as we take him) by the
namynge and comptyng of so many quarters of angels / he meneth nothing else
but to teache you a point of rekenyng and to make you perceive and know /
that.xx.d. is the fourth part of.vi.s.viii.d. For after that ra^e it seems
that he valueth the angel noble. Then goes he forth with his rekenyng and
shows you that five hundred thousand and.xx. thousand quarters of angels /
makes.ii. hundred three score thousand half aungellys. And by this so ye may
perceive clearly / that he meant not quarter sackes of angels for then they
would have holden ye wot well many moo pecys of forty pence / then forty
times this hole some comes to. Then he shows you ferther that.CC.lx.
thousand half aungellys / amounte just unto.C.xxx. thousand angels. wheryn
every man may learn that the half of.lx. is.xxx. and that the half of twain
is one. Finally then he casts yt all to gyther and brings yt in to pou^des
Su^ma totalis.xliii. thousand pou^des.iii. hundred and.xxxiii.li.vi.s.viii.d
But here to contynewe the playnesse of his reckoning / he forgote to tell you
yt.iii. nobles make.xx.s. and that.xx.s. make a pound But who can now dowte of
this reckoning when yt comes so round / that of so great a so^me he leueth
not out y^ ode noble But now sith all this rek^nynge is grounded upon two
false grounds / one upon.lii. thowsande paryshe churches: the other that
every of the five orders has every quarter of every howshold a penny: this
rekenyng of.xliii. thowsa^d CCC.xxx.ii.li.vi.s.viii.d. seems to come much like
to pas as if he would make a rekening with you y^ every ass has.viii. ears
And for to prove yt with / bear you furst in hand that every ass has four
heddes / and then make summa.iiii. heddes. Thene might he boldly tell you
ferther / that every ass head has two ears / for that is comenly true
except any be cut of. Su^ma then.ii. ears and so summa totalis eight ears.
At this account of eight ears of one a ^e ye make a lyppe and think yt so
mad that no man would make no such. Surely yt were a mad count in deed /
and yet as mad as yt were / yt were not so mad by half as is his sad and
ereneste count that he makes you now so solempnely of the frerys quarterage.
For this shu^d he ground but upon one lie / where he grounddih y^ the other upon
twain as open lies as this and as great. Now might we and we would) say that
all his reckoning were naught / because he rekeneh.xx.d. for the quarter of the
angel / and all the remenau^t of his rekenyng follows forth upon the same
rate. But we would be loathe to put him in the fawlte that he deserve not. For
surely yt might he that he was not ware of the new valuacyon: for he ran
away before the valuacyon changed? But now upon this great some of.xliii.
thusa^d.CCC.xxxiii.li.vi.s.viii.d. upon these good ground^ heped up to gether
he brings in his ragma^nes roll of his rude r^tory^u^ against the pore freres
/ beginning with such a great exclamacyon that we herd him hither / and
suddenly were all afraid when we herd hi cry out so loud / Oh grievous and
paynfull exaccyo^s: thus yearly to be paid / from the which the people of
your noble progenytours ancient Brytons ever stood fre. And so goes he forth
against the pore freres with Danes / and Saxons / and noble king A^^^ure / and
Lucius the emperor / the Romans / the Grekys / and the great Turk /
showing that all these had been utterly marred and never had been able to do
nothing in the war / if their people had given their almoyse to freres.

After his raylyng re^oryque ended against the freres / then this some
of.xliii. thowsa^d.CCC.xxxiii.li.vi.s.viii.d. he adds unto all y^ the other that
he said before that all the clergy has beside which he su^meth not but says
that this and that to gyther amounte unto more between them then half of the
hole substance of the realm. And this he affirms as boldylylas though he
could reken the hole reuenews and substance of all england / as redely as make
the rekenyng of this beggars purse.

Then shows he that this better half of the hole substance is shyfted
among fewer then the four hundred part of the people. Which he proves by
that he says that all the clergy compared unto the remannaunte of the men
only / be not the hundredth person. And if they be compared unto the
remanaunte of men / women / and children / so are they not he saeth the four
hundredth person. But now some folk that have not very long ago upon
greatoccasyons taken the reckoning of prestes and relygyous places in every
diocise / and on the other side the reckoning and the number of the temporal
men in every cou^tye: know well y^ this man's mad reckoning goes very far
wide / and seems that he has herd these wise rekenyngis a^ some congregacyon
of beggars. And yet as though because he has said yt he had therefore proved
yt / he runs forth in his raylyng rei^ryque against the hole clergy / and
that in such a sort and fassyon that very hard yt were to dyscerne whyther
yt be more false or more folyshe. For first all the fawtes that any lewd
priest or friar does / all that lays he to the hole clergy / as well and as
wisely as though he would lay the fawtes of some lewd lay people to yt defaut
and blame of all the hole temporaltye. But this way lyketh him so well that
thus layeng to the hole clergy y^ fawtes of such as be simple and fawty
theryn / and yet not only layeng to their charge yt breche of chastyte and
abuse in fleshely living of such as be naught / but also madly like a fond
fellow layeng much more to their charge and myche more ernestly reprouynge y^
good and honest living of those yt be good whom he rebukethe and aborreth
because they keep their vewes and persevere in chastyte (for he says that they
be the marrars and dysstroyers of the realm / bryngeng the la^d in to
wilderness for lack of generacyon by their abstaynynge from weddyng) then
aggreuyth he his great crimes with heynouse wordys / gay repetycyons / and
grievous exclamacyo^s / calling them blood suppers and dronken in y^ blood of
holy marters and saints / which he meanyth for the condemnynge of holy
heretykes. Gredy gosophers he calls them and ynsacyable whyrlpoolys / because
the temporalte has given them possessyo^s / and give to the freres their
almoyse. And all virtuous good preestys and relygyous folk he calls idle
holy thieves / because they spend their time in prechynge and prayour. And than
says he / these be they that make so many syk and sore beggars. These be they
that make these horys and baudys. These be they that make these theuys. These
be they that make so many idle parsons: These be they that corrupt y^
generacyons. And these be they that with the abstaynyng from weddyng hinder so
the generacyon of the people / y^ the realm shall at lenght fall in wyldernes
but if they wed y^ sooner. And now upon these high nous crimes laid unto the
hole clergy / and laid as every wise man sees some very falsely and some very
folyshly: after his goodly repetycyons be falls to his great and grievous
exclamacyons / crye^g out upon the great broad botomlesse occean see of yuels
/ and upon the greuouse shypwrak of the commonwealth / the translatynge of the
kyngys kyngdo^e / and the ruin of the kings crown. And therwyth rollynge in
his retoryke from figure to figure / he falls to a vehement inuocacyon of the
king / and gives him warnyng of his great loss / asking him fervently:
where is / your sword / power / crown / and dygnyte bycome^ as though the
kings grace had clean lost his realm specially for lack of people to reygne
upon / because that prestes have no wyuys. And surely the man cannot fail of
such eloquence: for he has gathered these goodly flowers out of Luthers
gardyne almost word for word without any more labor but only the
translacynge owte of the latin into the english tongue.

But to inflame the kyngys hyghnes against the church / he says that the
clergy labors nothing else / but to make the kings subg^^^es fall in to
dysobedyence and rebellyon against his grace.

This tale is a very lykely thing / as though the clergy knew not that there
is nothing erthly yt so much keeps them self in quiet rest and suertye / as
does the dew obedyence of the people to the virtuous mind of the prince.
Whose high goodness must needs have myche more dyffycultye to defend the
clargye and keep the church in peace / if y^ people fell to dysobedyence and
rebellyon against their prince. And therefore every child may se that the
clergy would never be so mad as to be glad to bring the people to
dysobedyence and rebellyon against the prince / by whose goodness they be
preserved in peace / and were in such rebellyo^ of the people lykely to be the
first that should fall in parell. But neither is there desired by the clergy
nor never shall by gods grace happen / any such rebellyon as y^ beggars
proctoure and his fellows what so ever they say long full sore to se.

But this man against y^ clergy fetches forth old farne years and ^^neth up
to king Iha^ns days / spe^dyng much labor about y^ praise and co^mendacyo^ of
yt good gracyous king and cryeng out upon y^ pope yt then was and the clergy
of England / and all the lordys and all y^ come^s of the realm / because king
Iha^n as he says made y^ realm trybu^ary to the pope / wherein he means
peradventure the peter pe^se But surely therein is all his hot accusacyon a
very cold tale when y^ troth is known. For so is yt in deed yt albe yt there
be wrytars y^ say y^ peter pe^^e were granted by king Iha^n for the release of
the incerdyccyo^: yet were they paid in deed ere ever king Iha^ns great
grau^dfather was borne / and thereof is there proof enough. Now if he say as in
deed some writers say / that king Iha^n made England and Irland trybutary to
the pope and the sea apostolyque by the grant of a thousand markys: we dare
surely say again that yt is untrue / and that all Rome neither ca^ show such a
grant nor never could / and if they could yt were right naught worth. For
never could any king of England give away the realm to y^ pope / or make the
land tributary though he would / nor no such money is there paid nor never
was And as for the peter pense if he mean the^ / neither was ye realm
trybutary by the^ / nor king Iha^n never granted the^. For they were paid
before the conquest to the apostolyk see toward the mayntenau^ce thereof but
only by way of gratytude and alms. Now as for the archbysshop Stephen / whom
he says being a traitor to the king / ye pope made archebyshop of Canturbury
against ye kyngys will / therein be there as we suppose.ii. lies at onys. For
neither was yt Stephen ever traitor against the king as far as ever we have
herd / nor ye pope none otherwise made him archebyshop the^ he made all other
at that time: but y^ same Stephen was well and canonycally chose^ archebyshop
of Ca^turbury by y^ coue^t of y^ mo^kis at Cristes church in Ca^turbury to who^
as y^ king well knew and denied yt not / y^ eleccyo^ of ye archebysshop at y^
time belo^ged. Nor ye king resystyd not his eleccyo^ because of any treason yt
was laid against him: but was disco^te^tyd therewith / and after yt his eleccyo^
was passyd and confirmed by ye pope: he would not of long season suffer him to
enjoy y^ byshoprich / because him self had reco^me^dyd another unto y^ mo^kys
/ who^ they reiectyd and preferryd Stephen. And that this is as we tell you /
and not as the beggars prec^our writes for a false fou^dacyo^ of his raylyng:
ye shall mow parceyue not only by diverse chronicles / but also by diverse
monume^tis yet remaining as well of the eleccyon and co^fyrmacyo^ of the said
arche bishop / as of the long suit and process that after followed theruppo^.

Now shows he him self very wroth with the spyrytuall iurysdyccyon /
which he would in any wise were clean taken away / saying that yt must nedys
dystroy the iurysdyccyon temporal: where as the good princes passed have
granted / and y^ nobles in their times / and the people to / have by plain
parleamentes confermed them / and yet hitherto blessed be god they agree better
to gyther / then to fall at varyaunce for the wild words of such a
malycyouse make bate: which for to bring the spyrytualtye in to hatered /
says that they call their iurysdyccyon a kingdom. In which word he may say
his pleasure / but of truth he seldom sees any spyrytuall man at this day
that so calls any spyrytuall iurysdyccyo^ yt he uses.

Now where this man uses as a proof thereof / that y^ spyrytualte names them
self always before the temporaltye: this manner of namyng comes not of them /
but of the good mind and devotion of the temporaltye: so far forth that at
the parlyament when that any ac^es be conceived / the words be comenly so
cowched / that the byll says it is enacted first by our sovereign lord y^
king and by y^ lords spyrytuall and temporal and the comens in that present
parlyame^t assembled. And these byllys be often drawn put forth and passed
first in the comen house / where there is not one spyrytuall man present.

But such truth as the man uses in this point / such uses he where he
calls the pore freres almoyse an axaccyon: surmysynge that yt is exacted by
force and the people compelled to pay yt / where every man well wotteth that
they have pore men no way to compelle no man to give the^ aught not though they
should die for defawt. But this good honest true man says that who so will not
pay the freres their quarterage they will make him be taken as an heretyque.

We be will content that ye take this for no lie / as many as ever have
known yt true. But who herd ever yet that any man taken for an here^yque / did
so myche as ones say that he thought yt conuayd by the malice of any friar for
refusyng to pay y^ freres quarterage. This lie lo is a little to loud / for
any man that were not waxen shameless.

Like treuth is there in this that he says / if any man trouble a preeste for
any te^porall suyte: the clergy forth with will make him an heretyque and
burn him / but if he be content to bear a fagotte for their pleasure. The
falsehed of this can not be unknown. For me^ know well in many a shyre how
often that many folk endyght prestes of rape at the sessynos. And as there is
sometime a rape committed in deed / so is there ever a rape surmysed were the
women never so willing / and oftentyme where there was nothing done at all.

And yet of any such that so procured priests to be indyghted: how many have
men herd taken and accused for heretyques? ye se not very many sessyo^s pass /
but in one shyre or other this page an^ is played / where as through the realm
such as be put to penance for heresy / be not so many in many years as there
be prestys endyghtyd in few yerys. And yet of all such so taken for heresye /
he shall not find four this four score year / peradventure not this four
hundredth year / that ever precended them self so troubled for endyghtyng of a
priest. So that his lie is herein to large to get any cloak to cover yt

Now where he says that the captayns of doctors Aleyns kingdom / have hepyd
him up benefyce upon benefyce / and have rewardyd him.x. times as much as
the.v.C. poundis which he paid for a fine by the praemunire / and that thus has
the spyrytualtye rewarded ^ym because he fought so ma^fully against the kyngys
crown and his dygnyte: all that know the matter do well parceyue that the man
does in his matter as he does in other / either lies for his pleasure / or else
little wotteth how that the matter stood. For it is well known that doctor
Aleyn was in the praemunire pursued only by spyrytuall me^ and had much less
favor and myche more rygour showed him therein by the greatest of the clergy /
then by any temporal men.

He says also to the kings hyghnes / your grace may se what a work there is
in London / how the bishop rages for endyghtyng of certain curates of
extorcyon and incontynencye the last year in the warmoll quest / would not
upon these words every stranger wene that there had been in London many
curates endyghted of extorcyo^ and rape / and that the bishop would labor sore
to defend their fautes and that there were about yt matter a great co^mocyon
in all the cite? How shameless is he that can tell this tale in writing to y^
kyng^ hyghnes for a troth / whereof neither bishop / nor curate / nor mayre /
nor alderman / nor any man else / ever hard word spoken? Hit were hard to say
whether we should take yt for wylynes or lack of wytt y^ he says all this
work was in the cite the last year: and then his book neither was put up to
the king / nor bears any date. So y^ a man would wene he were a fool that so
writes of the last year / y^ the reder cannot wit which year yt was. But yet
wene we he does yt for a wylynes. For sith he knows his tale false: yt is
wisdom to leave the time unknown / that his lie may be uncontrolled. For he
would that men should wene always that yt was in one year or other.

But finally for a special point he brings in Rychard Hu^ne and says yt if
he had not commencyd an accyo^ of praemunire against a priest / he had been yet
alive and none heretyke at all. Now is yt of trewthe well known / that he was
detectyd of heresye before the premunyre sued or thought upon.

And he began that suyte to help to stop the the other wythall / as in deed yt
did for the while. For all be yt that he that was sued in the praemunire was
nothing bylongynge to the bishop of London before whom Richard Hunne was
detectyd of herysy: yet left such as would be glad synysterly to mysseconster
every thing toward the clergy / might have occasyon to say that the matter
were hotely handeled against him to force him to forbere his suyt of the
praemunire / the bishop therefore did the more forbere / till yt appeared
clearly to the temporal judges and all that were any thing learned in the
te^porall law / that his suyte of the praemunire was nothing worth in the
kings law / for as much as by plain statute the matter was out of questyon
that the ple to be holden upon mortuaryes / belong unto the spyrytuall court.
After which thing well aperynge / the matter went forth before the bishop /
and he there well proved naught / and his books after brought forth / such and
so noted with his own hand in the margentes / as every wise man well saw what
he was / and was full sore to se that he was such as they their saw him
preued.

Now goes he ferther and asks the king / did not doctor Horsay and his
complyces most heynously as all the world kneweth / murder in prison that
honest merchant Rychard Hunne / for that he suede your wrytt of praemunire
against a pressed that wrongfully held him in ple in a spyrytuall court / for a
matter whereof the knowledge bylonged unto your high courts? And what punysment
has he for yt^ After that he had paid as yt is said.vi. hundredth pounds for
him and his complyces / as soon as he had obtained your most gracious pardon:
he was immedyatly promoted by y^ captains of his kingdom with benefyce upon
benefyce to the value of.iiii. times as myche. Who is he of their kingdom that
will not rather take courage to commyt like offense / seeing the promocyons that
fell to such men for their so offendyng / so weke and blunt is your swerd to
stryke a^ one of the offenders of this crooked and paruerse generacyon.

We have here sumwhat co^bred you with a piece of his awn words / because ye
should have a show of his vehement eloquence: with which the bold beagers
proctours so arrogantly presumethe in his byll to as^^ the king a questyon /
and to bind his hyghnes to answer as his maystershyp appoyntted him. For if
his grace say nay: then he tells him before / that all the world woteth yes.
But surely if he call all the world all that ever god made: then is there.iii.
parts that knows the contrary. For we dare be bold to wa^aunt you / that in
heaven / hell / and here among us in purgatory / of all that this man so boldly
affermeth / the contrary is well and clearly known. And if be call y^ world
but only men among you there living upon mydle yerth: yet so shall be
peradventure find in some part of the world if he seek yt well / mo
than.iiii. or.v. good honest men that never hard speak of the matter. And of
such as have hard of the matter and known yt well^he shall find mow and
specially we thynk the kings grace him self / whose hyghnes he is so homly to
ask the questyon and appoint him his answer him self that of all five things
which he has here in so few lines affyrmed / there is not one true but lies
every one. For first to begin where he leueth / when he says that the clergy
have syns the death of Rychard Hu^ne / promoted doctor Horsay with benefyce upon
been fyce.iiii. times as much as.vi.C. pou^des he plain vntreuth of this point
may every man sone know yt will sone inquire. For he lives yet at exester /
and their lives upon such as he had before / without that new hepe of
benefyce given him by ye captains of his kingdom for kyllyng of Rychard Hu^ne
/ or thank either save only of god for his long pacyence in his undeserved
trouble. But to the^d yt ye may se how little this man forces how loud he
lie: consider y^ he says that the clergy gave unto doctor Horsay after he came
out of prison benefyce upon benefyce to the value of.iiii. times as much
as.vi.C. pounds. Now if this be true / the^ has doccoure Horsay had in
benefyces besides all such as he had before his troble / the value of.ii.
thousand.iiii.C. pound. we trust that the man his substance and his lyuelod
is so well known / that we need not to tell that the beggars proctor in this
point has made one loud lie. A another is that he says that Hunne was kept in
ple in the spyrytuall law for a matter determynable in the kings court: for
the matter was for a mortuary / which by plain statute is declared to plain to
the spyrytuall law. The third is that Hunne was honest / except heresy be
honest. The fourth is that doctor Horsey and his complyces murdered him in
prison: for thereof is y^ contrary well known / and that the man hanged him
self for dyspayre / dyspyte / and for sak of grace. we might an we would lay
for the fyft / the payment which he speaks of the.vi.C. pounds / with which
money he would men should wene that he bought his pardon. wherein he lays a
good great some / to thend that folk well wyttyng that doctor Horsay was not
like to have so much money of his awn / should wene therwyth that y^ clergy
laid out the money among them / and the^ gave him benefyces whereof he might
pay them ageyn. But this layth he from him self / and shewyth not to whom / for
he says yt is said so. And yet were yt no wrong that yt were accounted his
own / till he put yt better from him / and prove of whom he herd yt. How be
yt sith there is other store enough: we shall leave this lie in questyo^ between
him and we wot nere whom else / and we shall for the fyfte lay you that lie
y^ he lays forth him self / that is to wit / where he says that the
chaunceller purchased the kings most gracious pardon for the murderyng of
Hu^ne. For this is the trouhe that he never sued any pardon therefore. But after
that the matter had been by long time and great dylygence so far forth
examyned / that the kings hyghnes at length (as time always tries owte the
trouth^ well perceived his innocence and theyrs also that were accused and
endyghted with hym^ his noble grace when they were arraygned upon that
endyghment and thereto pleded that they were not gyltye / commanded his
attornay general to confess their ple to be true / which is the thing that
his hyghnes as a most virtuous prince uses for to do / when the matter is not
only just / but also known for just upon the part of the party
defendaunte. Because that like as where the matter appears dowtefull he does as
reason is / suffer yt to go forth and (...) y^ troth be tried / so where he
sees and perceyueth the right to be on y^ other side / his hyghnes will in no
wise have the wrong set forth or mayntayned in his name. Now when yt was then
thus in deed / that neither the chaunceller nor any man else ever suede any
charter of pardon for y^ matter: this is then y^ fyftlye that this man has made
in so few lines. Which things who so well consider / can not but marvel of
the sore pyththy point where with he knytteth up all his heavy matter / saying
to the king: who is there of their kingdom y^ will not take courage to commyt
like offense seeing the promocyons that fall to such men for their
offendyng: so weke and so blunte is your sword to siryke at one of the
offenders of this crooked and perverse generacyon. Loo how this great zelator
of the commen welthe cries owte upon the king / that his sword is not
strong a sharp to stryke of innocencys heddis. He has of lykelyhed ransaked
up all dame retoryques rolls to find owte this goodly figure / to call upon
the king and ask his hyghnes where is your sword / and tell him his sword
is to dull: as though he would bid him bear yt to the cutlers to grynde / that
he might stryke of doctor Horsayes head whom his grace had found fawtelesse /
and testyfyed him him self for an innocence. If this man were here matched
with some such as he is him self / that has the eloquence that he has that
could find out such comely fygures of retoryque as he fyndeth set forth
and furnyshed with such vehement words as he thundreth owte like thunder
blastys / that has no less matters in his mouth than the great broad
botomlesse occean see full of euyls / the wekenes and dulnes of the kings
sword / the translacyon of y^ kyngys kingdom / the ruin of the kings crown
/ with great exclamacyons / Oh greuouse and paynfull exaccyons / oh cause most
horrible oh greuouse ship wrack of the commonwealth: what might one that had
such like eloquence say here to him? surely so myche and in such wise as we
sely poor pewlyng sowles neither can deuyse nor utter. But verily two or three
things we se and may well say that neither be these great matters mete for
the mouth of the beggars proctour / nor such prechyng of reformacyon and
ame^deme^t of the world mete matters for him to meddle with / which with open
heresies and plain pestylent errors / besely goes about to poison and
infecte the world: nor very conuenyent for him to take upon him to give
counsel to a king / when he shows him self to have so much presumpcyon
and so little wytt / as to ask the king a questyon and appoynte him his
answer: and therein to tell him that all y^ world knows that thing to be
true / which the king has him self all ready by his attorney and his judges
in open judgment / and in his high court of record testefyed and confessed
for false. If that man were not for malice as mad not as march hare / but as a
mad dog that runs forth and snatcheth he sees not at whom: the fellow
could never else with such open folly so suddenly over se him self. But yt
were wrong with the world if malice had as myche wit / cyrcumspeccyon and
prouydence in the pursuit of an ungracious purpose / as yt has have / yuell
will and wylynesse in the first in terprysynge. For as an ape has some
symylytude of a man / and as a fox has a certain wylynesse somewhat
resemblyng an vnperfayte wit: so fares this fellow / that begins as one
would wene at good zeal and cheryte borne toward the poor beggars. But
forth with he shows him self that he nothing else entendeth: but openly to
dystroy the clergy first / and after that covertly as many as have aught above
the state of beggars. And where as he would in y^ beginning by y^ towchyng of
great matters / feign seem very wise: with in a while in the progress he
proves him self a very stark fool. And where he would seem to show many
notable things which no man had marked but he / he prouydeth wisely that no
man may believe him he makes so many lies / and all that ever he does ferther
/ he buyldeth upon the same.

He lays that the living which the clergy has is the only cause that
there be so many beggars that be syk and sore. Very well and wisely / as though
the clergy by their substance made men blind and lame. The clergy also is
the cause he says why they dye for hunger / as though every lay man gave to
beggars all that ever he could / and the clergy give them never a grote: and
as though there would not mo beggars walk a broad if the clergy left of
such lay men as they find.

But he proves you that the clergy must nedys be the cause why there be so
many poor men and beggars. For he says that before the clergy came in their
were but few pore people: and yet they beggyd not neither / but men he says
gave them enough unasked. But now where sa^^he when he saw the people give pore
folk so fast their allmes unasked y^ no man neded to beg before the clergy
began. This man of lyklyhod is of great age / and or ere y^ clergy began was
wont to sit at saint Savors with a sore leg: but he beggyd not me^ gave him
so much unasked. For where as he alledgyth the bible for him in the acts of
the appostles / verily we meruayll much what the man meneth. For there he may
se that the apostels and the deacons which were then the clergy / had all to
gyther in there own handys / and dystrybuted to every man as them self thought
good. And therefore we wonder what he means to speak of that book. For we
think that he meneth not to hurt the clergy so now / as to put all in to their
hands. And surely but if he mean so / else is this place nothing for his
purpose. Now herein he shows also an high point of his wit / where he says
that the great living that the clergy has / which he lays and lies to be
more then half of the hole reuenews and substance of the realm: is shyfted
among fewer then the four hundredth part of the people. As though y^ of the
clergyes part there had no lay people their living / no servant any wagys /
none artyfycer any money for workyng / no carpenter no masyn any money for
byldyng: but all the money that ever cu^meth in their hands / they put yt by
and by in their own belyes / and no lay man has any relyef thereof. And
therefore this point was wisely written ye se as well as we. Now for the truth
thereof / if yt were true that he says / that the clergy compared to the
resydew of the men only / be not one to an.C. then shall ye not need to fere
y^ great Turk and he came to morrow / except ye suffer among you to grow in
great number these Lutherans that favor him. For we dare make you the
warantyse that if his lie be true / there be mo men a great meany in London
and within.iiii. shyres next adioynyng / than the great Turk brings in to
Hungary. But in this ye must hold hi^ excused / for he medleth not much with
angry in to se to what su^me the number of men aryseth that is multyplyed by
an.C. All his practyse in multyplycacyon medleth with nothing but lies: and
therein mache him with who^ ye will / he will give you a.C. for one. whereof if
ye lack let this be the sa^ple y^ he says / if thabbot of westmynster should
sing every day as many masses for his fou^ders as he is bou^de^ to do by his
fou^dacyo^. M. mo^k^ were to few / ye dout not we think but he ca^ tell you who
has bound the^ to how many / and so ca^ make ye y^ plain rekeni^ge y^ thabbot
is bound in the year to no fewer masses than.iii.C.lxv.M. He knows what is
every man's duty save his own. He is mete to be a beggars proctour / that
can so proll about and can tell all thing.

But now were all his payntyd process ye wot well nothing worth / but if he
devised against all these myscheues some good and holso^ help. It is therefore
a world to se what polytyke deuyces he fyndeth against y^ great broad
botomlesse occean see of euyls: what remedies to repair the ruin of the
kyngys crown: to restore and uphold his honor and dygnyte: to make his swerd
sharp and strong: and finally to save all the ship wrak of the commonwealth. ye
would peradventure wene y^ the man would now deuyse so^ good wholesome laws for
help of all these matters. Nay he will none thereof. For he says he douteth
that the king is not able to make any law against them. For he says that the
clergy is stronger in the parliament than the king him self. For in the higher
house / he rekenyth that the spyrytualte is more in number and stronger than
the temporalte. And in the comen house he says that all the learned men of the
realm except the kings learned council / be feed with the church to speak
against the kings crown and dygnyte in the parlyame^t for them: and therefore
he thinks the king unable to make any law against the fawtys of the clergy.

This beggars proctour would fayn show him self a man of great experyence / and
one that had great knowledge of the manner and order used in the kyngys
parlyame^tys. But than he speaks so sauourly hereof: that yt well apperyth of
his wise words he neither canneth any skyll thereof / nor never ca^ in the
house. For as for y^ higher house furst y^ kings own ryall parson alone more
than cou^terpaysyth all y^ lordys spyrytuall present with him and the temporyll
to. And over this the spyrytual lordys can never in number excede the lordys
temporal / but must nedys be far underneath the^ if yt please the king. For
his hyghnes may call thither by his wryt many mo te^porall lordys at his own
pleasure. And being as they be / there was never yet seen that the spyrytuall
lords bendyd them self there as a party against the temporal lords. But yt
has been seen that the thing which the spyrytuall lords have moved and
thought reasonable / the temporal lords have denied and refused: as appears
upon the mocyon made for legytymacyo^ of the children borne before the marriage
of their parentys. Wherein albe yt yt the reformacyon which the lords
spyrytuall moved / was a thing that nothing partayned to there awn commodyte /
and albe yt that they laid also for their part the constytucyon and
ordinance of the church and the laws of other christian cuntrees: yet could
they not obtain against the lords temporal that nothing alleged to the
contrary but their own wylles.

And therefore in the higher house the spyrytuall part never apperyd yet so
strong / that they might over match the temporal lords. And then how much ar
they to feeble for them and the king to / whose hyghnes alone is over strong for
the^ both / and may by his wryt call to his parlyame^t mo temporal lords when
he will. Now where he says y^ in the comen house all the learned men of the
realm ar feed to speak for the clergy except the kings learned counsel: there
be.ii. folyes at ones. For neither be all the lernyd men of the realm knights
or burgeyses in the comen house / and the kyngys learned counsel is not there
at all. And therefore yt seems that he has hard sumwhat of su^ men that had
seen as little as him self. And surely if he had been in the comen house as
some of us have been: he should have seen the spyrytualte not gladly spoken for.
And we little dout but that ye remember acts and statutes passyd at so^dry
parlyame^tes / such and in such wise and some of them so late / as your self
may se that either y^ clergy is not the strenger perte in the kings perlyement
/ or else have no mind to strive. And for the ferther proof that the kings
hyghnes is not so weke and unable in his own parlyame^t as this beggars
proctour so presumptuously tells him / his grace well knowyth and all his
people to / y^ in their own conuocacyons his grace never devised nor desired
any thing in his life / y^ ever was denied him. And therefore this gay inuencyo^
of this beggars proctour / y^ he fayneth the kings hyghnes to be in his high
court of parlyament more weke and feeble then the clergy / is a feeble deuyce.

But now sith he will have no law devised for the remedy of his great
complayntes / what help has he devised else. The help of all this gere is he
says none other thing / but to let him and such ryall raylers rail and gest
upon the church / and tell the people y^ prestes fawtes: and for the lewdnes
of part / bring y^ hole clergy in co^te^pt and hatered among all the
temporal folk. Which thing he says y^ king must needs suffer / if he will
eschew the ruin of his crown ^ dygnyce / And this thing he says shall be more
spedefull and effectual in the matter / than all the laws that ever can be
made be they never to strong. Lo good lordys and masters then shall ye need no
mo parlyame^t is. For here is god be thankyd an easy way wisely founden to
remedy with raylynge the great broad botomlesse occean se of yuels and to
save the comen weal from ship wrack / and the kings crown from ruin.

But now to the poor beggars. what remedy fyndeth their proctour for thereto
make hospytals? Nay ware of yt / thereof he will none in no wise. For thereof he
says the mo y^ worse / because they be profitable to prestes what remedy tha^?
Give the^ any money? Nay nay not a grot^. what other thing the^? Nothing in y^
world will serve but this that if y^ kings grace will byld a sure hospytall y^
never shall fail to releue all the sick beggars for ever / let him give
nothing to the^ but look what the clergy has and take all that from them. Is
not here a goodly myschef for a remedy? Is not this a ryall fest to leave these
beggars meteles / and then send mo to dinner to them? Oh the wise. Here want we
voice and eloquence to set out an exclamacyon in the praise and commendacyon of
this special high prouysyon.

This byll puts he forth in the poor beggars name. But we verily thynk if
them self have as myche wit as their proctour lacks / they had lever see
their byll maker burned / then their supplycacyon sped. For they may sone
perceive that he myndeth nor their almoyse / but only the spoil of the
clergy. For so that the clergy lose yt: he neither deuyseth ferther / nor
ferther forcyth who have yt.

But yt is ethe to se whereof spryngeth all his dyspleasure. He is angry and
fretyth at the spyrytuall iurysdyccyon for the ponyshme^t of heretykes and
burning of their erronyouse books: for ever upon that stryng he harpeth: very
angry with the burning of Tyndals testament. For these matters he calls them
blood suppers dronken in the blood of holy saints and marters. ye merueyll
paraduenture which holy saints and martyrs he menyth. Surely by his holy
saints and marters he meanyth their holy scysmatykes and heretykes / for whose
just ponyshment these folk that are of y^ same sect / fume / frete / frote and
foam / as fyerce and as angerly as a new huntyd sow. And for the ra^cour
conceyuyd upon this dysplesure / comes up all his co^playnt of the
possessions of the clergy. Wheryn he spares and forbereth the nu^nys yet /
because they have no iurisdyccyon upon heretykys: for else he would have cried
out upon their possessyo^s to. But this is now no new thing nor yt furste time
yt heretykes have been in hand with the matter. For furste was there in the.xi.
year of king Henry the fourth / one Iha^n Badby burned for heresy. And forth
with theruppon was there at the next perlyment holden y^ same year / a byll put
in / declaryng how much temporal la^d was in the church / which rekenyng the
maker thereof gessyd at by y^ number of knygh^s fees / of which he had went he
had made a very just account. And in this byll was yt devised to take their
possessions out again. How be yt by the byll yt appeared well unto the^ which
well vnders^^de y^ matter / that the maker of the byll neither wist what land
there (...) / nor how many knights fees there was in the church / nor well
what thing a knights fee is: but the byll devised of rancour and yuell will by
some such as favored Badby that was burned / and would have his heresies feign
go forward.

And so yt byll such as yt was / such was yt esteemed and set a side for
naught. So happed yt the^ sone after that in y^ first yereof y^ kings most
noble progenytour king Henry the fyfte those heresies secretly crepyng on
still among the people: a great number of them had first couertely co^spyred
and after openly gathred and assembled them self / purposyng by open war
and battle to destroy y^ king and his nobles and subuerte the realm. Whose
traytorouse ma^yce that good catholyque king prevented / wythstode / overthrew
/ and punyshed: by many of them taken in the feld / and after for their
traytorouse heresies both hanged and burned. Whervppon forthwyth at y^
parlyme^t holde^ y^ same year / like wise as that ryall prince (...) virtuous
nobles and his good christian co^munes / devised good laws against heretyques:
so did some of such as favored them / efte sonys put in the byll against the
spyrytualltye. Which efte sonys considered for such as it was and cummynge of
such malyciouse purpose as yt came: was again rejected and set a side for
naught. The^ was there long after that / one Richard howndon burned for here
sye. And the^ forth with were there a rabble of heretyques gathered them self
to gyther at Abyndon: which not ente^dyd to lose any more labor by putting up
of byllys in the parlementes / but to make an open insurreccyon and subuerte
all the realm / and then to kill up y^ clergy and sell priests heddes as
good chepe as shepys heddes threfor a penny bye who would. But god saved y^
church and y^ realm both and turned their malice upon their own heddes.
And yet after their punishment then were there some that renewed the byll
again. And (...) after this was there one Iha^n Goose roasted at y^ tower hill.
And (...) forth with some other. Iha^n goose byga^ to bear that bell a br^de
again / and made some gag^ing a while but yt auayled him not. And now because
some heretyques have been of (...) ab^^red / this (...) therefore has made this
beggars byll / and gageleth a (...) upon the same matter / and that as he
thinks by a proper (...) lykely to speed now / because he makes his byll in
the name of the (...) and his byll cowhed as full of lies as any beggar
swarmeth full of lyce.

We neither will nor shall need to make myche busynes abowte this (...) myche
better in the goodness of good men / the^ (...) need for this thing to reason
against an unreasonable (...). We be sure enough that good men were they y^
gave this (...) and therefore naught should they be of lykelyhed that (...)
thense again. To which rauyne and sacrylege our lord (...) shall never suffer
this realm to fall.

(...) Austeyn in his days when he parceyuyd that some (...) at the
possessions that then were given in to (...) in an open sermon among all the
people ^ffer them (...) again and that his church and he would forsake the^ /
(...) them take them who would. And yet was there not ^found^ in all the
town aloe yt that the people were as these Affrycanis (...) barbarouse /
fyerce and boystuouse / yet was there none as we say fowden any one so badde /
that his (...) word serve him to en^^e in to one fo^e.

When Phargo the king of Egypt bought up in the dear years all the landys
that were in every man's hand / so that all the people were feign to sell
their enherytaunce for hunger: yet ydolater as he was he would never suffer for
any need the possessions of y^ prestes to be (...) / but made prouysyon for
them beside / and suffered them to keep their landys still / as the bible
bears witness / And we verily trust that the good christen princes of the
christen realm of England shall never fail of more favor toward the
clergy of Christ / then had that prince Idolatre to the priests of his
ydolles. ye^ is yt not enough to the cruel mind of this man to take from the
hole clergy all that ever they have / but that he would ferther have them
bounden unto carts and whypped to drive them to labor. Of all thieves is this
one of the wurste and most cruel kind. For of all thieves me^ most abhor
them that when they have taken a man's money from him / the^ take and bind
him and beat him to. But ye^ is this wretch much wurse. For he fares as a
cruel thief that would without respect of his own commodyte / take a man's
money from him and cast yt he care not where / and then bind the man to a
tree and beat him for his pleasure. Oh the cheryte.

But he says he would have them whypped to compel them to labor and get
their living in the sweet of their faces. And this would he not good man but
for fulfullyng of goddys commandment. For he says that yt is commanded
them in the first chapter of Genesys. And therefore is he theryn so indifferent
that he excepteth none / but calls the best but idle holy thieves / and so
would have the all robbed and spoiled / bounden and beten to compel them to
w^^k with their hands / to get their living in the sweet of their faces for
the fulfullyng of goddys commandment. Among this company that he would
sodaynely send forth new robbed with right naught left them: is there many
a good man that has lived full godly many a fair day / and duly served god
and prayed for us / which we have well founden: many an old man: many a sore
syk man: and many blind and many same to. All which as soon as they be dreue^
owte of their own doors / this cherytable man would be very well content to
see them bounden and beten to / because they be of y^ clergy For excepcyon
makes he none / in this world.

He lays unto the charge of the clergy that they live idle (...) that they be
all bound to labor and get their living in the swe^e of their faces / by
the precepte y^ god gave to Adam in the first chapter of Genesys. Here this
man shows his co^nyng. For if (...) be so: then were the priests in the old
law bounden thereto as well as is y^ clergy now. And then how happed yt that
of this poy^^e there was no mencyon made by Moses? how happed yt that god in
that law provided them myche larger living then he did the lay people? and
that such kind of living as declared that his pleasure was that they should
live out of labor and upon y^ labor of other man's hands? The holy apostle
saint Powle / all though him self in some places forbear to take his lyuinge
freely / but rather chose to live of his own labor then to be in their
daungeour which would happily have said yt he preched because he would live at
^ase thereby / and this did he specially to put such false apostles to (...) /
as for such desire of idle living fell some where to false prechynge: yet
neither did he so in every place / and also confessed and said that he might
well and lawfully have done the contrary / affyrmynge yt for good reason y^ he
that serves the awter should live of the (...) and sayng also: if we sow unto
you spiritual things / is yt a great thing if we repe your carnal things?
Now christ his own mouth said unto the people / that they should not leave
their duties unpaid unto the preests. And this good chryste^ man would have
them all clean taken from them and yet the priests well beten to.

He rekeneth all the clergy idle / because they labor not with their hands
till their faces sweet. But our savior christ rekened far other wise in
blessed Mary Magdalene / (...) syttyng at her case and herkenyng / he accounted
and declared (...) busynes then the busy styryng and walkyng about of his good
(...) Martha which was yet of all worldly busynes occupied abowte the best:
for she was busye abowte almoyse and hospetalyte / and y^ gestynge of the best
poor man and most gracious geste that ever was gested in this world.

Now if this can not yet content this good man because of gods commandment
given unto Adam that he should eat his bread in y^ sweet of his face: the^ wo^d
we feign wit whycher him self never go to me^e till he have wrought so sore
with his hands if at his face sweteth Surely we believe he labors not so
sore before every meal. (...) w^renor good to trust his answer / for he will
happily say yes / and not le^e for one lie among so many. How be yt he
thinks yt per^due^ture enough for him / y^ (...) sweet in seeking owte old
heresies / and deuysyng n^we And verily if he look y^ such busynes should
serve him for a dyscharge of hard labor much be^er may we thynk (...) of
many good men whom he would have beten (...) lives in fasting / prayer and
prechyng / and studyeng abow^ the troth. But yt is good to look bytyme what
this beggars (...) means by this commandment of ^and labor that he speaks
of when if he confess that yt byndeth not every man: then is yt laid ^o no
purpose against the clergy. For (...) was a small clergy (...) that word was
said to our first foder Adam. But now if he call as be (...) / and then will
that yt (...) unto all the hol^ kind of man / as a thing by god commanded
unto Adam and all his of spryng the^ though he say little now / he meneth to go
(...) then he speaks of yet. For if he might first have the clergy put out of
their living / and all that they have clean taken from them / a might have
them joined to these beggars if a^ be now / and over y^ added unto them and
send a beggyng to / all those y^ the clergy find now full honestly: this
pageau^t ones played / and his beggars byll so well spedde / then when the
beggars should have so much (...) living and be so many moo in multitude:
surely like wise as for the beggars he now makes his byll to the kyngys
highness against bishops / abbo^tys / pryours / prela^ys / and preestys: so
would he then wychyn a while after make a another byll to the people against
merchauntys / gentylmen / kyngys / lordys / and princes / and complain that
they have all / and say that they do nothing for yt but live idle / and that
they be commanded in Genesys to live by y^ labor of their handys in the sweet
of their facys / as he says by the clergy now. Wherein if they wene that
they shall stand in other case the^ the clergy does now: they may
peradventure sore deceive them self. For if they will thynk that their case
shall not be called all one because they have landys and goodys to live upon /
they must consider so has the clergy to. But yt is the thing yt this beggars
proctor co^playneth upon / and would have them taken away. Now if the landed
men suppose that their case shall not seem one with the case of the clergy /
because they shall happily thynk that the church has their possessions given
them for causes which they fulfill not / and that if their possessions happen
to be taken from them yt shall be done upon that ground / and so the lay
landed men owte of that fere because they think that such like occasyon and
ground and consyderacyon fails and can not be founden in them a their
enherytau^ce: surely if any man clerk or lay have landis in y^ gift whereof has
been any co^dycyon adioynyd which he fulfylleth not / the geuer may well with
reso^ use theryn such aduau^tage as yt law gives him. But on y^ the other side
who so will advise pryncys or lay people to take from y^ clergy their
possessyo^s / allegyng matters at large / as layng to their charge that they
live not as they should / nor use not well their possessions / and that therefore
yt were well done to take them from them by force and dyspose them beter: we
dare boldly say who so gives this deuyce as now does this beggars proc^our /
we word give you counsel to look well what will follow. For he shall not fail
as we said before if this byll of his were sped / to find you sone after in a
new supplicacyon new balde reasons ynow yt should please the peoples cares /
wherewych he would labor to have lordys landis and all honest me^nys goodys to
be pulled fom them by force a dysiry bu^ed among beggars. Of which there should
in this wise yt he deuyseth encreace and grow so many / that they should be able
for a sodayn shyft to make a strong parle. And surely as the fire ever ^^epeth
forward and laboreth to turn all into fire: so will such bold beggars as this
is / never cease to solycyte and precure all that they can / the spoil and
robbery of all that ought have / and to make all beggars as they be them self.

We be co^^ent y^ ye believe us not / but if yt have so prouyd all ready by those
vplandysh Luthera^s that rose up in Almaygne. Which being onys raised by such
sedycyose books as is this beggars supplycacyon / and such sedycyouse heretykys
as is he that made yt: set furste upon spyrytuall prelatys. But shortly
theruppon they so sirechyd unto the temporal pryncys / that they were feign to
join in aid of them self with those whom they laughed at furst to se them put
in the paryll / hoping to have had the profit of their loss / till they saw
y^ they were lykly to lose their own with them. And for all the ponyshment yt
they pursued upon those rebellyouse parso^s / of whom there were in one somer
slain above.lx.M. yet is that fire rather couored than quenchyd^ because they
suffered yt crepe forth so far at furst / yt (...) ar^ow thereby among the
lordys the^ self / as there ca^ never (...) some nedy rauenouse sa^ded men /
that shall be ready to be captayns in all such rebellyons: as was the lord Cobham
called Old castle sometime a captayn of heretykes in England in the days of
king (...) the fyft. And surely there would sone follow some sore change in
the temporalie / if this beggars proctour have his malycyouse supplycacyon
spedde against the spyrytualte.

^ut yet lest folk should abhor his hard heart and cruelte: ye man te^peryth
his matter with a goodly vysage of the sore inward sorrow yt he takes for the
(...) of mankind / and with the great zele that he hereth to generacyo^ for
the good encreace of christian people in the sa^d. For he would for that cause in
any wise that all ye clergy should have wives. For he asks ye kings hyghnes
as the man ha^h caught a great pleasure to appose the king / wherein he uses a
figure of rethoryk that me^ call sauce malaper^e what an infynyte number of
people mygh^ have been increased to have peopled your realm / if this sort of
folk had been ma^^ed like other men. This matter that prestes must nedys have
^wyues he bring lhe dyuers^y in.iii. or.iiii. placys. And among other he
has one / wherein he shows in raysynge against the clergy a princypall par^e
of his excellence eloquence. For there he uses his ryall figure of rethoryke
called repetycyo^ / repetyng often by ye hole clergy: these be they in ye
begi^nyng of his clause* These be they yt have made.C.M. idle hores in your
realm. These be they y^ corrupt the generacyo^ of ma^kynd in your realm. These
be they that draw mennys wives in to incontynency in your realm. And after
diverse of such these be these / he concludes and knytteth up the ma^er with
his accustomyd vehemence ^et out of Luthers volumys askyng who is able to
number the great broad botomlesse occea^ see full of yuels / that this
myscheuouse and sinful generacyo^ brings up upon us? As though all the hole
clergy were of this co^dycion and no man else but they. But among all his these
be thays / this is one which as the sorest and the most vehemente / he secteth
in the fore front of the^ all: These be they that by their abstaynyng fro
maryage^ do let the generacyon of the people / whereby all the realm at lenght
if yt should be continued shall be made desert and inhabytable.

^ Lo the deep insyght that this beggars proctour has in the broad botomlesse
occea^ see full of yuels to save the greuouse shypwrak of the commonwealth. He
sees far farther than ever Christ was ware of / or any of his blyssed
apostles / or any of ye old holy fathers of crystys faith and resigyon syns his
holy assencyo^ hitherto / till now yt Luther came of late and Tyndale after him
/ and spyed out this great secret mystery that neither god nor good man coud
espy. If their abstaynyng fro marriage should make all the la^d desort and
inhabytable / how happeth yt that habytacyon endures theryn so long: for the
land has lasted sith the beginning of their absteynynge from marriage ye
wot well many a fair day. And now if their abstayni^g from marriage not
wythstandyng / the land has been vpholden with the generacyon of you yt ar the
temporalie so long: ye shall likewise hereafter be gods grace and the help
of good prayours for keeping the land from wyldernes / be able to get children
still your self / and shall not need to call neither monkys nor freres to help
you.

Now if yt be so that ye clergy be as he says but the hundred p^rt of the men
/ and yet not so much nether: there is not then so great parell of the land to
fall to wyldernes / but yt the.lxxxxix. parts may mayntayn yt populouse /
though the hundred part abstayn. (...) for to show that he has not left his
anxyouse favor toward his natyue country though he be run away from yt for
heresy^ fereth sore lest ye hundred par^e forberyng marriage / all the.lxxxxix.
(...) shall not be able so to preserve yt with generacyon / but that yt shall
wa^ not only desert / but also / whereof we most wonder inhabitable / yt is to
say such as of yt self shall not be able for manny ^ habytacyon: But he
paraduenture takes inhabytable for desert / desola^e and not inhabyted /
because men should se that he can so roll in his rethoryk / that he wotteth not
what his own wordys mean.

And sumwhat yet is yt to be considered / that in such part of his book that
he would have yt appear that their living is to much: there he would make yt seem
that they were very few. And where he would have them take wyuys: he would have
them seem so many / that their abstaynyng from marriage were able to bring all
the land into desolacyon and wilderness. And thus he handles either part so
wisely: yt there lakketh him nothing yerthly theryn / but eue^ a penny weight of
wit. For faw^ whereof / his wyly folly foreseeth not that one par^e of his process
ever impugneth a another. For they that were right now so small a part of
people that a littell would suffyse for their living: be now suddenly so many
that if they were married infynyte number of people he says to ye king would
increase to people his (...) in with Now if that be true that of them alone if
they were married / so infynyte number of people would increase / that yt would
make ye realm populouse: then either ar they contrary to his count mo then the
hundredth part (for one out of a.C. is no very parceyuable mysse / nor one added
to an.C. no very parceuable increase) or else if they be but the hundred part
as he made his rekenyng right now / yet if yt be then true that he says syns /
that of the hundred part married so infynyte number of people might yncrease to
people the realm: then can he not deny but that of the.lxxxxix. partys there
may grow.lxxxxix. times infinite number of people. And then they being so /
though ye clergy being as he says but y^ hundred part never mary: yet shall
y^ po^^ fool not need to wake and wax lene for fere of the realm falling to
wyldernes. In which he sees y^ there may of the.lxxxxix. partis re^^ew / grow
and increase.lxxxxix. times infynyte number of people to make yt land
populouse. Yet maruayle we much of one thing ye in all his fere yt generacyon
should fail because y^ clergy maryeth not: he sees no man unmarried in all the
realm but the^ How many seruau^tys? How many tall serving men are there in
the realm that might if men saw such a sodayn necessyte / rather mary then the
clergy y^ have vowed to god the contrary? But he forces not so much for the
matter that he makes his pretext / as he does in deed to have all vows void /
that he might get Luther sum lewd companyons in England.

But now what if this good man had the rule of this matter / and would put out
all the clergy and bid them go wed? He should paradu^ture find some that would
not much styk thereat: but they should be of the worst sort / and such as now be
sklaunder of their order / and who^ yt were most need to keep fro generacyon /
lest yuell crows bring you forth yuer byrdys. But as for the good prestys
and good relygyouse whose chylderne were like to be best and to be best brought
up: they would not mary for breche of their vows. And thus should ye have the
naughty generacyons increase whereof there be to many all ready: and of the
better never the mo.

What would this good man do now with good folk of the clergy y^ would not mary?
He would of lyklyhod bind them to carts and beat them and make them wed in the
wanyand. But now what if women will not wed the^ / namely sith he sendith the^
out with right noght / saving slander / shame and vylanye? what remedy will
he find therefore? He will of lyklyhod compel the women to wed them: and if
the we^ch be nyce and play the wanton and make the matter strange then will he
beat her to bed to.

Surely we can not but here confess the troth / these nyce and wa^ton wordis
do not very well with us: but we must pray god and you to pardon us. For in
good faith his matter of monkys maryagys is so mere and so mad / that yt were
able to make one laugh that sieth in the fire: and so much the more / in how
much he more ernestly preacyth upon the king in this point / to have in any
wise the clergy robbed spoylyd / bounden / beten and weddyd. Whereby what
oppynyon he has of weddyng / ye may sone parceyue: for ye se well that if he
thought yt good / he would not wyssh yt them. Many that read his wordys /
wene that he were some merry mad geste: but he seems us far otherwise. For
except he were a wonderouse sad man of him self / he coud never speak so
ernestely in so mad a matter.

Yet one thing would we very fayn wit of him. When he had robbed spoiled /
bounden / beten and wedded all the clergy / what would he the^* Should any of
them be curatys of mennys souls and preche and mynyster the sacramentys to the
people or not?

If they should: yt were a very strange fassyon to robb him / bind him / and
beat him on the tone day: and then knele to him / and confess to him / and
receive the sacrament of his hand on y^ the other day / reverently here him
preche in the pulpytte / and then bydde him go get him home and clowte shone.
Either he must mean to have yt thus / which none honest man could endure to
se: or else of which twain we wot nere well whyther is the wurse / he
entendeth to have all holy orders accounted as nothing / and to have no mo
sacramentys mynystred at all: but where as sone after crystes ascencyon his
church buried the ceremonies of the jews synagoge with honor and reverence /
so would he now that christian people should kill and cast owte on a donge hill the
blessed sacramentys of christ with v^lany rebuke and shame. And surely to tell
you y^ troth / this is his very fynall intent and purpose / and the very mark
that he shoteth at / as a special point and fou^dacyon of all Luthers heresies
whereof this man is one of the baner berers. And therefore here would his own
high sore wordys have good place against him self. For this myscheuouse deuyse
of his / is in deed a great broad botomelesse occean see full of euyllys /
wheryn would not fail the greuouse shypwrake of the commonwealth which god would
sone forsake if ye people ones forsake his faith / and contempned his holy
sacramentys / as this beggars proctour labors to bring abowte. Which
thing his deuyce and conueyaunce well declares / all though he forbere
expressly to say so far / because of the good^ and gracious catholyke mind
that he well knows and by his gracys excellent writing perceyueth to be
borne by the kings hyghnes / to the catholyk faith. For which he covers his
malycyouse intent and purpose toward the faith / under y^ cloak of many
temporal benefytes / that he says should succeed and follow to the kyngys
hyghnes and his realm / if these his high polytyque deuyces were ones by his
grace agreed.

For in ye end of all his byll: he gathers his high co^moditees together /
saying that if the king take all from the clergy / set the^ abroad at the
wide world with right naught to wed and take wives / and make them labor for
their living till they sweet / bind them to carts and beat them well / he
says to the king in ye beggars names: then shall as well the nombre of our
foresaid mons^ruouse sort / as of the bawdes / hores / theuys / and idle people
decreace. Then shall these great yearly exaccyons ceace / The^ shall not your
sword / power / crown / dygnyte and obedyence of your people be translated
from you. Then shall you have full obedyence of your people. Then shall the
idle people be set awork. Then shall matrymony be myche better kept. Then
shall the generacyon of your people be increased. Then shall your come^s
increase in riches. The^ shall none take owre almoyse from us. Then shall the
gospel be preached. Then shall we have enough and more. The^ shall be y^ best
hospytall that ever was founded for us. Then shall we pray to god for your
noble estate long to endure.

Lo here here ye heped up many great co^modytees / if they were all true. But
we showed you before and have also proved you / that his byll is myche grounded
upon many great lies / whereof he by and by byganne with some and after went
forth with mo. And now to thentent that the end should be somewhat surely to the
remanaunte as he byganne with lies and went forth with lies / so will he with
lies likewise make an end: saving that in the bygynnyng he gave them out by
tale / and in the end he brings them in by hepes. For first he says y^
then shall the number of sore and like beggars decreace. How so? shall there by
the robbyng / weddyng / byndynge and betynge of the clergye^ blind beggars
get their sight again or same beggars their legs? is there no man in all
the clergy syk and sore that shall be by this way sent unto them? should there not
many that now be in good health wax shortly syk and sore / and sytte and
beg with them? were this a mynyshement of syk and sore beggars to make mo
and send to them?

The^ shall / he sayth^ bawdes / ^hores / thieves / and idle people decrece. This
man weneth he were cosyn to god / and coud do as he did: Dixit and facta sunt.
For as soon as he has dyuysed yt / now weneth he yt if they were all put owte
and so served by and by / the^ were all forthwith in good order. As soon as he
says let them wedde / now he weneth yt forthwyth every preeste monk and
friar has a wife. As soon as he has said bind them and beat the^ to wurke /
forthwyth he weneth every man is at his wurke. And all this he rekeneth sure
ere ever he provide wurke for them / or where they shall dwell / or who shall
take so many to wurk at onys y^ never were wo^te to wurke before / and this
where he sees many walk idle all ready / that either no betyng can drive to
wurke / or else no man will take to wurke. First we trust that among the
clergy there be many men of that goodness and virtue / that scante a devil
could find in his heart to handle them in such dyspytuouse and dyspyghtfull
manner. But go to set their honest living and virtue lie still in questyon /
yet at the least wise he will grant they be good or naught. Now then if they
be good: he is to very a vylayn y^ would sarue good men so. And on y^ to there
side if they be all as he would have them all seem / unthrifty / sewde / and
naught: how can yt be that by that reason of so many so noughty / so suddenly
set owte at large / ye should have bawdes / harlottys / theuys / and idle
people decreace? except he think that those whom he calls naught all ready
being as they now be kept in / and in honest fassyo^ refrayned / and many
kept up in cloisters / wylbe better ruled abroad runnyng at y^ wyld world as
bukkys broken out of a park. Over this how can there by the maryagys of
preestys / monkys / and fryres / be fewer hores and bawdys / when by the very
marriage yt self being as yt were incestuouse and abhomynable / all were stark
harlottys that married them / and all stark bawdys that should help to bring
them to gether.

The^ shall he says / these great yearly exaccyo^s ceace. How can such thyngys
ceace as never yet byganne. Ye remember what thyngys he calied exaccyons / the
freres quarterage / which he said that they exact of every household / and
compel them to pay yt upon pain of heresye / beryng of a faggot or burning.
Can he among so many as pays yt not / lay you one sample y^ ever any said he
was so served this seven year / this.vii. score year / this.vii.C. year? Can he
say yt ever yt was exacted of him self? We know where he dwelled / and that
if he had had none other cause to ru^ne away / surely for any fere of freres y^
ever exacted of him quarterage / he would not have been afraid to dwell by the
best of their berdes.

Then shall idle folk he says be set a wurke. By what meanys? whom has he
devised mo to set idle men a wurke? but if he look that idle men shall be set
a wurke by them whom he sends owte of their own housys without money or
wax / neither he nor they wot whyther.

Then shall matrymony by myche better kept. Why so? because there be mo men
unmarried sent out abroad to brek yt? Who (if they be such as he calls them)
were (if they went all abroad) well lykely to break many a another mannys
marriage ere they made all their own.

Then shall the generacyon of your people be encreaced. Is that the greateste
fawte he fyndeth the lak of generacyon? If he saw as far as he would seem to se
/ the^ should be spyre yt it were first more need to provide houses to dwell in
/ with land laid thereto for tyllage: or else experyence techeth that there
is generacyon enough for ye corn that the ground bears. And that thing ones
well provided for / there will ynowe be founden to multyply more generacyon of
such as may laufully wedde and would wedde / if they wyste where after wedding
their wife and their children should dwell.

Then shall not your sword / power / crown / and dygnyte / and obedyence of
your people / be taken from you. Who has taken yt away now? who has his
sword borne but his hyghnes him self or such his deputyes as he appoynteth
yt unto? his crown no man wereth but him self / as far as ever any of us
herd. And yet if his hyghnes have any crowned kings under him / his swerd /
power crown and dignyte / is nothing defaced nor mynysshed: but honowred and
enhaunced by that. But all the myschefe is that the spyrytuall court has
examynacyon of heretyques / this is all the gryefe. For as for obedyence of the
kyngys people / his hyghnes fyndeth none taken from him. Was there ever king
in this realm better obayd the^ he? Has his hyghnes of any part of his realm
been better obayd or more humbly served the^ of his clergy? Was there ever any
king in the realm that had his crown translated from him / because the
clergy had landys given them / or because men gave almoyse to the pore freres?
in good faith ye may trust us we never knew none such. When y^ beggars
proctour preueth any such ye may then believe him: and in the mean time ye may
well believe he lies.

Then shall ye have obedience of your people. yet again? Till he find in the
kyngys realm some that dare dysobay him / yt were not myche against reason that
harpynge so myche upon that string / yt every mannys care perceyueth so false
and so far owte of tune: he should confess him self a fool.

Then shall your people encreace in richesse. Wherefore y^ rather? Not one
halfepeny for aught that he has spoken yet / except he mean when he takes the
land from the clergy / then to dyuyde yt among the people and make a dole of
the freres almoyse to. And if he mean so: when he says yt owte plainly then
will we tell you what he means more. But in the mean season to prove him
both false and folysshe / yt is enough to tell him / that the people can not
wax rych by their coming to them that are sent owte naked and bring naught
with them.

Then shall none beg our almoyse from us. No parde / none but all they that
ye will have sent owte naked to you / which would be mo then ye would be
glad to se sytte and beg with you / and se the^ ask your almoyse from you
y^ were wont to give almoyse to you.

Then shall the gospel be preched. ye mary that that. There is y^ great matter
that all this gapyng is for. For undoubtedly all the gapynge is for a new
gospel. Men have been wont this many years to preche the gospel of criste in
such wise as saint Matthew / saint Mark / saint Luke / and saint Iha^n has
wryte^ yt / and in such wise as y^ old holy doctors saint Hyero^^ / saint
Austyn / saint Ambrose saint Gregory / saint Chrysostom / saint Basyle / saint
Cypryan / saint Barnerd / saint Thomas / and all the old holy faders synnis
crystys days until your own days have understand yt. This gospel has
been as we say always thus preched. Why says he now that if ye clergy were
cast owte for naught / that then y^ gospel should be preached. Who should then
be these prechours? He means not yt ye clergy shall / ye may se that well.
Who than? Who but some ley Lutheranes? And what gospel shall they preche? Not
your old gospel of Christ: for yt is yt which was wont to be preched unto
you. And he would ye should now thynk that the gospel shall begin to be preached:
and yet not begin to be preached among you / till the clergy be cast out. What
gospel shall that be than that shall then be preached? What gospel but Luthers
gospel and Tyndals gospel? tellyng you yt only faith suffyseth you for
saluacayn: and that there nedyth no good workys / but yt yt were sacrylege and
abhomynacyo^ to go about to please god with any good workys: and that there is
no purgatory / nor that the sacramentys be nothing worth / nor y^ no law can be
made by man to bind you: but that by your only faith ye may do what ye will:
and yt if ye obey any law or governor / all is of your own curtesye and not
of any duty at all: faith has set you in such a lewd lyberte.

This and many a mad frantyke folly shall be the gospel yt the^ shall be preached
/ whereof he bosteth now as of one of the most special co^modytees / that
shall succeed upon his goodly and godly deuyces.

Will ye plainly parceyue yt he means thus: After all his myscheuys rehersyd
against the church: he has an other matter in his mind / which he dare not
yet speak of / but he makes thereof a secret ouerture leuyng yt in such wise at
large / as he would that men should guess what he men / and yet he reseruyth him
self some refuge to flytte therfro when he list. For if he should se that men
should myslyke yt / he would in such case say that he meant some other thing. And
therefore he purposes yt under these wordys: Here leave we out y^ greatyst matter
of all / lest we declaring such an horrible carrayn of evil against the
mynysters of iniquyte / should seem to declare the one only fawte or rather y^
ignorance of our best beloved mynyster of ryghtuousnes. which is to be hyd
till he may be learned by these small enormities y^ we have spoken of / to know
yt plainly him self.

This thing put forth like a rydle / hard to read what yt should sygnyfye: we
have had synnys / by such as we before showed you y^ dyed and came hither /
plainly declared unto us. And surely who so well aduyseth his words / and well
pondereth his hole purpose / and the summary effect of his book: shall mow
sone perceive what he means in that place. For what should that thing be that
he leueth out that should be the greatest of all / and that should be laid
against the mynysters of inyquyte which he means and calls y^ hole clergy
and that should be such an horrible carayne of evil / y^ yt should pass and
excede any myscheuouse matter that he had all ready spoken against before? what
manner of mycheuouse matter should this be?

This horrible carrayn of yuell that he leuyth out / sith yt is as he says the
greatest matter of all^ must nedys ye wot well be greater against the clergy /
than all that great broad botomelesse occean see of yuels: more than all his
These be theys: more than the making of such great number of beggars / of idle
men / bawdy / hoorys and theuys: more than the hyndryng of matrymony /
corruptyng of generation: more than translatyng the kyngys kingdom: more tha^
bryngyng the kyngys crown to ruin: more than bryngyng the comen weal to
shypwrak / and all the realm to wyldernes. What thing can this horrible carrayn
be that the clergy does / that he leueth out for a while / that so far
excedyth these mycheuouse matters before remembryd / that in comparyson of yt he
calls them all small enormities / and as a man would say little pretty
peccadulyans? Verily by this thing means he none other / but the prechyng of
the very hole corpse and body of the blessed faith of Christ / and the
mynystryng of the blyssed sacraments of our savior Christ / and of all those
in especyall the consecratyng of the sacred body the flesh and blood of our
savior Christ. For the techynh and prechyng of all which thyngys / this beggars
proctour or rather the dyuels proctour with other beggars that lak grace and
nether beg nor look for none: bear all this their malice and wrath to the
church of Christ. And seeing there is no way for attaynyng their intent but
one of the twayn / yt is to wit either plainly to write against the faith and
the sacramentys (wheryn if they gat them crede^ce and obtaynyd / they then se
well the church must nedys fall therwyth^ or else to labor against the church
alone / and get the clergy dystroyd / wheruppon they parceyue well that the
says and sacraments would not fail to decay: they parce yuyng this / have
therefore furste assayd the furst way all ready / sendyng forth Tyndals
tra^slacyon of the new testament in such wise handled as yt should have been the
fou^tayn and well spryng of all their hole heresies. For he had corrupted and
purposely changed in many placys the text / with such wordys as he might make
yt seem to the unlearned people / that the scryputre affyrmed their heresies it
self. Then came sone after out in prynt the dyaloge of friar Roy and friar
Hyerome / between y^ father and y^ son against y^ sacrament of y^ altar: and
the blasphemouse book entytled the beryeng of the mas^e. Then came forth after
Tyndals wykkyd book of Ma^mona / and after that his more wykkyd book of
obydyence. In which bokys before specyfyed they go forth plainly against the
faith and holy sacraments of Crystys church / and most especyally against the
blyssed sacrament of y^ altar / with as vylanous words as the wreches coud
deuyse. But when they have perceuyd by experye^ce yt good people abhorred their
abomynable books: the^ they being thereby lernyd yt the furst way was not y^
best for y^ furtherance of their purpose / have now determined the^ self to
assay the secu^de way / that is to wit y^ forberynge to write so openly and
dyrectely against all the faith and the sacrame^tys as good christian men could
not abide the redyng / they would / with little towchyng of their other
heresies / make one book specially against y^ church and look how that would
prove. Which if yt succeed after their appetytys that they might with false
crimes said unto some / or with the very fawtis of some bring the hole church
in hatered and have the clergy dystroyed: the^ should they more esely win
their purpose that way. For when the prechours of the faith and very gospel
were dystroyed or far owte of credence with y^ people / then should they have
their own false gospellys preched / as ye may perceive that this man means
where he says y^ the^ shall the gospel be preched. And therefore this is the
thing which this man as yet leueth out against the^ / that is to wit the
prechyng of the right faith and the sacrame^tys / which thing he rekeneth in
the clergy a more horrible carayn / the^ all the crimes wheryn he has bylyed
them before: And therefore says he yt he leueth yt owte / lest he should seem
to declare the one and only fawt of the kyngis hyghnes. Which one only fawte
he means his gracys most famous and most gracious book / that his hyghnes
as a prince of excellent crudycyon / virtue / and devotion toward y^ catholyke
faith of christ / made of thassercyon of the sacramentys against y^ furyouse
book of Marthin Luther. This godly deed done by his hyghnes / with
thacceptacyo^ of his godly well deserved title of defensoure of the faith given
his grace by the sea apostolyque / this calls this beggars proctoure the
kyngys one and only fawt and ignorance of their false faith in estymacyon of
these heretyques / which this beggars proctour says that he will for the while
hyde and cover under his cloak of silence / till the king may by these
enormytyes where with he bylyeth the church in his beggars byll (wyche
enormytyes he calls small enormyties in comparyson of the prechyng of the
catholyke faith and the sacramentys) be learned. What lesson trow ye? None other
surely / but that they hope that as well his hyghnes as his people / may by
such beggars byllys be first alured and brought in / to contemn / hate and
dystroye y^ church: and then thereby learn the the other lesson which he now leueth
owte for the while / that is to wit to set at naught the catholyque faith
and all the blessed sacramentys / after the techyng of Luthers and Tyndallys
gospel. And therefore says he as we told you byfar / that then shall the
gospel be preched.

And in the mean time y^ man uses as he weneth him self to ward y^ kyngys
grace a very wise fassyon of flatery / calling him their best beloved
mynyster of ryghtuousnes: yet be they not only run away for fere of the
ryghtuousnes of their best beloved mynister of ryghtuousnes / but also would yt
should seem yt his hyghnes were such a mynyster of ryghtuousnes / as either set
so lyttel by ryghtuousnes that he would wyttyngly suffer / or else had so little
insyght in ryghtuousnes that he coud not parceyue / so great a matter and such
an horrible carrayn of yuell commyttyd by the church / as were so heynouse / so
houge and so great: that in comparyson thereof / the translatyng of his kingdom
/ the ruin of his crown / the shypwrak of his comen w^ale / the dyspeplyng of
his realm / and bryngyng all his land in to desolacyon and wyldernes: were but
sleyght matters and small enormities. And that his hyghenes should toward this
great horrible a intolerable myscheuouse demeanu^e of the church / be ayding
and assystent either of yuell mind or of ygnoraunce / till that by their
beggarly byll being turned into the hatred and the dystruccyon of y^ church he
might thereby be illumynyd to learn and parceyue that the faith which his
grace had before both lernyd and taught / and whereof him self is the deffensor
/ is false and faynyd: and if at the sacraments be but m^nnys inuencyons / and
that theruppon he should be content to lern the gospel of Luther and the
testament of Tyndale. And thus ye may se what the beggars proctour meant by his
proper inue^tyd rydle / by which as ye se under a fond face of flatery he uses
toward his prince and souerayn lord ^whose majesty both by the law of god and
the duty of his allegyaunce he were hyghely bounden to reverence) an open
plain dyspyte and contumely.

Now to thentent yt ye may yet farther parceyue and se y^ they by the
dystruccyon of the clergy / mean the clear abolycyon of Crystys faith: yt may
like you to confer and compare to gether.ii. placis of his beggars byll. In
one place after that he has heped up to gether all his lies against the hole
clergy / and thereto adjoined his greuouse exclamacyon: Oh y^ greuouse shypwrak
of the come^ weal: he says that in au^cyent time before the coming of the
clergy / there were but few pore people and yet they did not beg / but there
was given them ynogh unasked / because at yt time he says there was no clergy
(who^ he calls always rauenouse woluys) to ask yt fro the^: and this says he
appears in y^ book of the actys of y^ apostles. In this place we let pass his
threfold folly. One that he would by that there were no beggars in one place /
prove thereby that there were none in all y^ world beside. For as he for lakke
of wit and understanding mystaketh the book / he weneth that there were none
that beggyd in Hyerusalem. which if yt were true / yet might there be ynow in
other placys.

A another of his folyes is in that he alleges a book for him that no thing
proves his purpose. For in all that hole book shall he neither find that
there was at that time few pore people / nor yt pore people at that time begged
not. Far of truth there were pore people and beggars / idle people / and
thieves to / good plenty both then and all way before / sins almost as long
as Noes flode / and yet peradventure seven year before that to. And so were
there in deed in Heyrusale^ also among them all / till crystendome came in /
and yet remained then among such people there as turned not to the faith of
Christ. The third folly is / he lays that book for him which in deed preueth
plain against him. For where he says yt appears there that the clergy was
not then come / we can not in y^ world deuyse of what people he speaks
Paynyms / Jews / or christian men. If he mean among Paynyms / his folly and
his falsehed both is to euydent. For who knows not that among the Paynyms
they had aL way their preestys / whose living was well and plentuously
provided for / as ye may perceive not only by many other stories / but also by
many places in the bible / and specially in the.xlvii. chapyter of genesys. If
he speak of the Jews / every man woteth well that they had a clergy thousands
of years before the book that he alleges / and their living far more
largely provided for / then any part of ye people bysyde / and that by goddys
own ordinance. Now if he speak of y^ christian people that was at that time in
Jerusalem where y^ fayeth byganne / his book makes sore against him. For
there was a clergy as soon as there was any christen people. For the clergy
byganne the^. And that clergy had not a part of the christian peples substance
/ but had yt all to gether / and did dystrybute yt as they saw need / which no
man dowteth but that the parties showed them / or else in some nedys they
must nedys have laked. So that here were many pore me^ if they be pore that
have naught left / and all they beggars / if they be beggars that be feign to
show their need and ask / and y^ clergy had all to gyther. And yet lays this
wise man this book for him / being such as if he should have sytten and
studied therefore / he could not have founden a book that made more against him.

But as we said before / we shall let his false folly pass / and pray you
to consider what he would have you believe. He says and would ye should wene that
there were few pore folk / and no beggars no where before y^ clergy of
cryste^dom ca^ in / but that all y^ pouerte and beggary ca^ in to y^ world with
the criste^ clergy. Now knows every man y^ the christian clergy and the christian
faith / came in to the christian people to gether / so that in effect his wordys
way to this y^ all pouerte and beggary came in to the world with the christian
faith.

Set now to this place the the other place of his in the end and conclusyon of
his book / where he says that after the clergy spoylyd onys and cast out /
then shall the gospel be preched / and the^ shall we beggars have enough and
more: lo like as in the tone place he shows that all begary came in with y^
clergy yt brought in ye faith / so shows be in the the other that there should
with the clergy all beggary go forth again / if they were so clean cast out
that Cristys gospel being cast out with them / and the faith which came in with
them / they might have that gospel prechid as they say they should and as in
deed they should which they call the gospel / that is to wit Luthers gospel
and Tyndallys testament / prechynge the dystruccyon of Crystys very faith and
his holy sacraments / auauncyng and setting forth all boldenes of sin and
wrechydnes / and under the false name of cryste^ fredome / spurryng forward the
dyuylysh unbridled appetyte of lewd sedycyouse and rebellyouse lyberte / that
slew in one somer as we showed you before above.lx.M. of y^ pore vpla^dysh
Lutheranis in Almayn. And this is all that these heretykys look for as the
fruit of their se dycyouse bokys and beggars byllys / trustyng by some such
ways to be eased of their beggary / which they now sustayn being run out of
the realm for heresy. For if they might as they fayn wold^ have ye clergy cast
out / and Crystys gospel cast of / and their own gospel preched: the^ hope
they to find that word true where he says: then shall we have enough and more.

For of all that ever he has said / he has not almost said one true word save
this. And surely this word would after their gospel onys preached and receyuyd
be fou^den over true. For the^ should the beggars / not such beggars as he
seems to speak for that be syk sore and lame / but such bold presumptuouse
beggars as he is in deed / hole and strong in body but weke and syk in soul /
yt have their bodies clean fro skabbys and their soulys foul infect with ugly
great pokkys and leprye: these beggars would hope to have and except good men
take good head would not fail to have enough and a great deal more. For after
that they might the clergy furst dystroyd bring in onys after yt the prechyng
of Luthers gospel and Tyndals testament / and might with their herysyes and
falls faith infect and corrupt the people / causyng them to set the blyssed
sacraments aside / to set holy days and fasting days at yought / to contemn
all good workys / to gest and rail against holy vowed castyte / to blaspheme
the old holy fathers and doctors of Cristys church / to mok and scorn the
blyssed sayntys and martyrs y^ dyed for Crystys faith / to reject and refuse y^
faith that those holy martyrys lived and dyed for / and in the stead of y^ true
faith of christ continued this.xv.C. years / to take now the false faith of a
fond friar / of old condemnyd and of new reforgyd wythyn so few days with
contempt of god and all good men / and obstynate rebellyouse mind against all
laws rule and governance / with arrogante presumpcyon to meddle with every
mannys substance / with every ma^nys land / and every mannys matter nothing
partaynynge to them: yt is we say no dowte / but that such bold presumptuouse
beggars will / if ye look not well to their hands / not fail to have as he
writes enough and more to. For they shall gather to gyder at last / and
assemble them selfs in plumpes and in great rowtes / and from asking fall to
the taking of their almoyse them self / and under pretexte of reformacyon
(berynge every man that aught has / in hand that he has to myche) shall
assay to make new dyuysyon of every mannys land and substance: never
ceacynge if ye suffer them / till they make all beggars as they be them self
/ and at last bring all the realm to ruin / and this not without bochery and
foul blody handys.

And therefore this beggars proctour or rather the proctour of hell should have
concluded his supplycacyon not under the manner that he has done / that after
the clergy cast owte / tha^ shall the gospel be preched: then shall beggars
and bawdys decreace: the^ shall idle folk and theuys be fewer: then shall the
realm encreace in richesse and so forth. But he should have said: After that
the clergy is thus destroyed and cast out / then shall Luthers gospel come
in / then shall Tyndallys testament be taken up: The^ shall false heresies be
preched: The^ shall ye sacraments be set ate nough: The^ shall fasting and
prayour be neglected: The^ shall holy saints be blasphemed: Then shall
almighty god be dyspleased: Then shall he wythdrade his grace and let all
ru^ne to ruin: Then shall all virtue be had in derysy^n: Then shall all vice
reygne and run forth unbridled: Then shall youth leave labor and all
occupacyon: Then shall folk wax idle and fall to vnthryftynesse: Then shall
horys and theuys beggars and bawdys encreace: The^ shall vnthryftys flok
together and swarm abowte and each bear him bold of other: Then shall all
laws be laughed to scorn: Then shall the servants set naught by their
masters / and unruly people rebelle against their rulers: Then will rise up
ryflyng and robbery / murder and myscheyfe / and plain insurreccyon / whereof
what would be the end or when you should se yt / only god knows. All which
myschyefe may yet be wythsta^den easily and with gods grace so shall yt / if
ye suffer no such bold beggars to seduce you with sedycyouse byllys. But well
perceyuyng that their malycyouse purpose is to bring you to destruccyon / ye
like good cryste^ people auoydyng their false traynes and grynnes / give none
ear to their heynowse heresies / nor walk their sedycyouse ways. But
perseueryng in your old faith of criste / and obseruyng his laws with good
and godly warkis and obedience of your most gracious king and governor / go
forth in goodness and virtue / whereby ye can not fail to flower and prospere
in riches and worldely substance: which well employed with help of goddys
grace abowte cherytable deeds to the nedy / and the rather in remembrance and
relyefe of us / whose need is relyued by you charity showed for our sake to
your neighbor / be able to purchase you myche pardon of the bitter pain of
this paynfull place / and bring you to yt ioyefull bless / to which god has
with his blessed blood bought you and with his holy sacramentys enseygned you.
And thus will we leave the mannys malycyouse folly / te^dyng to the dystruccyo^
first of the clergy and after of your self / wheryn his mad reckoning has
constrained us to trouble you with meny tryfles god wot full unmeet for us:
and now will we turn us to the treatyng of that one point / which though
yt specially perteyneth to our self / yet much more specially perteyneth yt
unto you: yt is to wit the impugnacyon of that vncherytable heresye wherwhyth
he would make you to owre great harm and much more your own / believe that we
need none ^elpe and that there were no purgatory.

The end of the first book
The second book.
WHen we consider in our self dear brothern and systern in our savior Christ /
y^ present paynfull panges yt we feel / and therwyth ponder upon the the other
part / y^ parylouse estate of you y^ ar our frendys there living in yt wrechyd
world: wit you very surely that this pestyle^t oppynyo^ bego^ against purgatory
/ not so much greuyth us for y^ lak yt we should find thereby in y^ relyefe of
our own intolerable torments / as does for the love y^ we bear you / the fere
and heaviness yt we take for yt parell and ieopardy yt should euerlystyngly fall
to your own sowlys thereby. Nor of all the heavy tydyngys y^ ever we hard here
/ was there never none so sore smote us to y^ heart / as to here the world wax
so faint in the faith of Criste / that any man should need now to prove
purgatory to christian men / or that any man could be founden / which would in so
great a thing so fully and fastly believed for an undoubted article this.xv.C.
year / begin now to staggar and stand in dowt / for the unwise wordys of any
such malycyouse parson / as is he yt made the beggars supplicacyon. For whose
answer and full confutacyon yt seems us suffycie^t / that ye may clear
parceyue his wordys to be of little weight / while ye se that the man has
neither lernyng / wisdom nor good intent: but all his byll utterly grounded
upon error / evil will and untruth. And surely this were to us great
wonder if christian men shulde^ need any other proof in this world to reprove
such sedycyouse folk wythall / the^ the only toke^ of the dyuels badge which
them self bear ever about the^: the badge we mean of malice and of a very
dedely dyuelyshe hate.

For where as our sauyoure Christ has so left love and charity for the
badge of his christian people / that he commands every man so largely to love
other / that his love should extend and strech unto his enmy / nor there is no
natural man nether Paynym / Jew / Turk nor Saracene / but he will rather spare
his foo than hurt his friend: this kind of folk is so far fallen not only
from all christian charity but also from all humanite and felyng of any good
effeccyon natural / and so chau^gede into a wild fyerce cruel appetyte more
tha^ brutysh and bestyall / that they furste without ground or cause take
their fre^dys for their foes / hatynge the church dedely because yt wylleth
their weal and labors to amend the^: and after to do the chirch hurt who^
they take for their e^myes / they labor to do us much more hurt whom they call
still for their frendys. For they to get pulled from the clergy the frail
co^modytees of a little worldy living / labor to have us their fathers / their
mothers / their friends and all their kynne left lyeng in thy fire here
helpless and forgotten / they little force how long. And in this they show
their affection much more unnatural and abomynable / tha^ he yt would with his
swerd thrust his fre^d through the hole body to the hard haft / to give his enmy
behynd him a little pryk with the point. This ways of theyrs were very noght and
detestable / although they truly meant in deed / as much good as they falsely
pretend. For where as they cloak their cruel purpose and intent / under color
of a great zele toward y^ commonwealth / which they lay to before e^payryd by
great po^p and inordynate lynyng used in y^ church: we be so far fro the mind
of defe^ding any such spyrytuall vice / carnal uncleanness / or worldly pomp and
vanyte used in y^ clergy / yt we would to god yt were much less tha^ yt is /
not in the^ only but also in y^ te^poralte. And there is none of nether sort
but if he were here with us but one half hour / he would set little by all such
worldly vanitees all his life after / and little would he force or rek whether he
ware sylk or sak cloth.

But surely this man if he meant well: the faulys of yuell folk he would lay to
them self / and not unto y^ hole clergy. He would also labor for amendment and
betteryng / not for dystruccyon and undoing finally. He would hold him self
wythyn his bounds / only deuysyng against mennys vyes / and not start out
therewith in to plain and open heresies. But surely so has yt ever hitherto
prouyd / that never was there any that showed him self an enmy to the church /
but though he covered it never so close for the while / yet at the last always
he prouyd him self in some part of his work^ so very an enmy to the catholyk
faith of Christ / that men might well parceyue that his malice toward the
clergy grew furst and sprang of infydelyte and lak of right belyefe. And of
this point was there never a clerer ensample than this beggars proctour: which
was so far forth farsed / stuffed and swollen with such venamouse heresys /
that albe yt he longed sore to keep them in for the season / and only to rail
aganst the clergy and hyde his enmyouse intent toward the faith: yet was he not
able to co^teyn and hold / but was fayn for brastyng to puff out one blast of
his poyson^d sent against us sely sowlys: y^ goodness of god dryuyng him to y^
dysclosyng and dyscoueryng of his malycyouse heresy / to the^tent ye should
thereby parceyue out of what ungracious ground his enmyte sprang that he bare
against the church. Which thyngys ones parceyu^d and consyderyd: must nedys
mynyshe and byreue him his credence am^ng all such as are not affeccyonate
toward his errors and infect and venomed with his mortal heresies / and of
such folk we trust he shall find very few.

For surely not only among christian people and Iewys / of whom the tone has /
the the other has had / the perceyuyng and light of faith / but also among the
very myscreaunt and ydolaters Turkys / ^aracens / and Paynyms / except only
such as have so far fallen from the nature of man in to a brutyshe bestely
persuasyon as to believe y^ soul and body dye both at onys: else has allwaye
y^ remanaurt commonly thought and byleued / y^ after the bodies deed and
deceaced / the soulys of such as were neither dedely dampened wreches for ever /
nor on the the other side / so good but that their offenses done in this world
has deserved more punyshement the^ they had suffered and sustained there / were
punyshed and pourged by pain after y^ death ere ever they were admytted unto
their wealth and rest.

This faith has allwey not only faithful people had: but also as we say very
myscreauntes and ydolaters have ever had a certain opinion and persuasyon of
y^ same: whyther that of the first light and reuelacyon given of such thyngys
to our formar fathers / there has allway remained a glymerynge that has gone
forth fro man to man / fro one generacyon to a another / and so continued and
kept among all people: or else that nature and reason have tought men every
where to perceive yt. For surely that they have such bylefe not only by such
as have been trauayled in many cuntrees among se^dry sectys / but also by y^
old and ancient writers that have been among them: we may well and
euydentely perceive. And in good faith if never had there been reuelacyo^ given
thereof / nor other light the^ reason: yet presupposed the immortalyte of ma^nys
soul which no reasonable man dystrusted / and thereto agreed the ryghtuousenes
of god and his goodness which scant the devil him self denies / purgatory
must needs appear: For sith that god of his ryghtuousenesse will not leave sin
unpunished / nor his goodness will perpetually punysh the fawt after y^ ma^nys
conuersyon: yt follows that y^ punysheme^t shall be temporal. And now sith
the man often dies before such punyshement had / either at goddys hand by
some afflyccyon sent him or at his own by due penance done / which y^ most
part of people wantonely does forslouth: a very child almost may se the
co^seque^t yt the punysheme^t at y^ death remaynyng due and undone / is to be
endured a sustained after. which / sith his majesty is so excellent whom we
have offended / can not of right and justice be but heavy and sore.

Now if they would peradventure as in magnyfyenge of goddys high goodness say /
that after a mannys conuersyon onys to god again / not only all his sin is
forgyuen but all the hole pain also / or that they will under color of
enhau^cing the merit and goodness of Crystes passion tell us yt his pain
suffered for us / stands instead of all our pain and penance / so that
neither purgatory can have place nor any penance need to be done by our self
for our own sin: these folk that so shall say / shall under pretext of
magnyfye^g his marcy / not only sore mynyshe his vertewe of justice / but also
much hinder the opinion and parsuasyon that me^ have of his goodness. For albeyt
yt god of his great marcy may forthwith forgive some folk freely their sin
and pain both without preiudyce of his ryghtuousnes / either of his lyberall
bou^te or for some respect had unto the fervent sorrowful heart that fere and
love with help of special grace have brought into the penytente at the time
of his return to god / and also that the bitter passion of our savior beside
the remyssyon of the perpetuyte of our pain do also lessen our purgatory and
stand us here in maruelouse high stead: yet if he should use this point for a
general r^le / that at every conuersyon fro sin with purpose of amendeme^t
and recourse to co^fessyon / he shall forthwyth fully forgive without the
parties pain or any other recompense for the synnys commyttyd save only
Crystys passion paid for the^ all: then should he give great occasyon of lyghtnes
and bold courage to sin.

For when me^ were onys parsuaded that be their synnys never so sore / never so
many / never so myscheuouse / never long so co^tynued / yet they shall never
bear pain therefore: but by their only faith and their baptysm with a short
return again to god / shall have all their sin and pain also clean forgeuen
and forgotten / nothing else but only to cry him marcy as one woman would yt
tredyth on a nothers train: this way would as we said give the world great
occasyo^ and courage not only to fall boldly to sin and wrechednes / but also
careless to contynew theryn / presumyng upon that thing that such heretykes
have parsuaded unto some me^ all ready / that.iii. or.iiii. wordys ere they dye
shall suffycyently sarue them to bring them strayghte to heaven. where as
besydys the fere that they should have lest they shall lak at last the grace to
turn at all / and so for faut of those.iii. or.iiii. wordys fall to the fire
of hell: if they believe there with the thing y^ truth is bysyde / that is to
wit that though they hap to have the grace to repent and be forgeuen the
sin and so to be delyueryd of the endless pain of hell / yet they shall not
so freely be delivered of purgatory / but that beside the general relyefe of
Crystys hole passion extended unto every man not after the valor thereof but
after the stynt and rate appoyntyd by godd^s wysdom / great and long pain
abydyth them here among us / whereof their wyllyngly taken penance in the
world / and afflyccyon there put unto them by god / and there pacyently borne
and suffered with other good dedys there in their life done by them / and
finally the merytes and preyours of other good folkys for the^ / may mynyshe
and abbredge the pain / which will else hold them here with us in fire and
turmentys intolerable only god knowyth how long: this thing we say as yt is
true indede / so if the world well and fyrmely for a sure truth believe yt /
can not fail to be to many folk a good bridle and a sharp bytte to refrain
them from sin. And on y^ the other side y^ contrary belyefe would send many
folk forward to sin / and thereby instead of purgatory in to everlasting
pain.

And therefore is this place of our temporal pain of purgatory not only
co^sonaunt unto his ryghtuouse justice / but also the thing that hyghly
declares his great mercy and goodness / not only for that the pain thereof
hough and sore is yt / is yet less then owr sin deserves: but also most
especyally in that by the fere of pain to be suffered and sustained here / his
goodness refrayneth men from the boldenes of sin and neclygence of penance /
and thereby keeps and preserves them from pain everlasting: where as the
light forgeuenes of all to gether / would give occasyon by boldenes of sin and
presumpsyon of easy remyssyon / myche people to run down hedlynge thither.
And therefore were as we said that way very far contrary not only to goddys
justice and ryghtuousenes / but also to his goodness and mercy. Wheruppo^ as
we said before it must needs follow that sith the pain is allway due to sin /
and is not allwaye clean forgeuen without co^uenye^t penance done or other
recompense made / nor pain is not allwey done / nor any recompense made in the
man's life / and yet the man dyscharged of hell by his co^uersyon: all y^ pain
y^ remains must nedys be sustained here with us in purgatory.

But now if these heretyques as they be very self wylled and will full /
will set at naught the comen opinion and beleyfe and persuasyon of almost
all the world: and as they be very unreasonable make lyttel force of reason and
ever ask for scripture / as though they believed holy scripture / and yet when
yt makes against them / they then with false and fond glosys of their own
making / do but mok and shyfte over in such a tryflynge manner that yt may
well appear they believe not scripture neither: yet sith they make as they
byleued scripture and nothing else / let us therefore se whether that purgatory
do not appear opened and reveled unto christian people in holy scripture self.

And first yt seems very probable and lykely / that y^ good king Ezechias for
none other cause wept at the warnyng of his death given him by the prophet /
but only for the fere of purgatory. For albe yt that diverse doctors allege
diverse causes of his heaviness and lothenes at that time to depert and dye: yet
seems there none so lykly as the cause that ancient doctors allege / that
is to wit y^ he was loathe to dye for the fere of his estate after his death /
for as much as he had offendyd god by ouermych lykyng of him self: wherwyth he
wist y^ god was dysplesyd with him and gave him warnyng by the prophet / that
he should live no le^ger. Now co^syderyd he so the weight of his offense / yt he
thought and estemyd the only loss of this present life far under the just
and condygne ponyshme^t thereof / and therefore fell in great dread of far sorer
ponyshme^t after. But being as he was a good faithful king / he coud not lak
sure hope through his repentance of such forgyneues / as should presarue him
from hell. But sith his time should be so short yt he should have no laysour to
do penance for his faut: he therefore fered yt the remau^te of his ryghtuouse
ponyshment should be parformyd in purgatory. And therefore wept he te^derly and
longyd to live longer / that his satysfaccyon done there in the world in
prayour and other good virtuous deeds / might abolish and were out all the
pain y^ else were toward him here among us. To which his fervent boon and
desire at the co^te^placyon of his penitent heart / our lord of his high pity
co^dyscended and grauntyd him the lengthyng of his life for.xv. years / making
him for his farther cu^fort sure thereof by y^ show of a manifest miracle. But
whereto grau^tid our lord y^ le^ger life / to be bestowed upon worldy delight
and pleasure? Nay nay verily. But to thente^t yt might appear that it was of
goddys great marer grauntyd for the redemyng of his purgatory by good workys
for his satysfaccyon: he was promised by the prophet not only y^ he should
within.iii. days be recovered and hole / but also that he should go in to the
temple to pray. So that yt may thereby appear for what end and intent he longed
so sore for a longer life.

Now if the beggars proctour or Tyndale or Luther either / list to say y^ in
this point we do but guess at that good kings mind / and therefore purgatory
thereby rather su^what resoned tha^ well and surely prouyd: thereto may we well
answer and say / that the cyrcumstaunce of the matter consyderyd / with the
virtuous holiness and co^nyng of such as so long ago have taken the scripture
thus: y^ place alone is a far better proof for purgatory / tha^ ever any of
the^ coud hitherto lay against yt yet. For albeyt this beggars proctour says
y^ right wise and co^nynge me^ will say y^ there is no purgatory at all / by
which wise men he menyth Luther and Tyndall and him self: yet was there never
any of them all that yet laid any substancyall thing either reason or
authorytye for them / but only geste and rail / and say that purgatory is a
thing of the popes own making / and that soulys do nothing till domis day but
lie still and sleep. And thus tellyng such wise talys for their own part /
and making mokkys and mowes at every thing that makes against their folly for
our part: they go forth in their evil will and obstynacy / and with murmur
and grudge of their own consyence / content them self with y^ only feding
of their malycyouse myndis by the encreace of their faccyon / of such as fall
in to their felyshype rather of a light mind and lewd pleasure to taire a
part / then of any great credence that they give unto them or greatly force
which way they believe. For surely if these folk were reasonable and
indyfferent as yt is not well possible for them to be / after that they refuse
onys to believe y^ catholyque church and in y^ understanding of scripture lene
only to their own wyttys / but else as we say if they could with an equal
and indyfferent mind consider and way what they here: they should sone se
their heresye reproved and purgatory surely co^fermed / not only by probable
reason taken of the scripture as in y^ place that we rehearsed you of Ezechyas /
but also by plain and euydent textys.

For have ye not the wordys of scripture written in the book of the kyngys:
Dominus deducit ad inferos et reducit: our lord brings folk down in to hell
and brings them thense again? But they yt be in that hell where the dampened
sowles be: they be never delivered thense again. Wherefore yt appears well
that they whom god delyuereth and brings the^se again / be in that part of
hell that is called purgatory.

What say they to the wordys of the prophet zachary: Tu quoque in saguine
testamenti tui eduxisti vinctos tuos de lacu in quo non erat aqua: Thou have in
the blood of thy testament brought out thy bounden prisoners owte of the pyt or
lake in which there was no water. In that they whom the prophet there speaks
of were bounden / we may well perceive that they were in ^ prison of
punyshement. And in that he calls them the prisoners of god: yt is eth to
perceive that he means not any that were taken and emprysoned by any other
than the dampened spyrytys the very gaolers of god. And in that he says that
there is in that lake no water: we may well perceive that he spoke yt in
descrypcyon of that dry pyt of fire / where in there is no refreshyng: For as
hot are we here as they are in hell. And what ^ete is in the pyt where there
lakketh water: our savior him self declares by the wordys of the rych gloton
lyeng in such a lake from whense at sight of pore Lazarus in Abraham's bosom /
he desired heuely to have him sent unto him with one drop of water to
refreshe his tongue / that after all the delycates that yt had tasted in his
life / lay there the^ sore burning / and never set half so much by twenty tonne
of wine / as he set by one pore drop of water. So that as we show you / these
wordys of y^ prophet zachary. Thou haste brought owte thy bounde^ presoners
owte of the lake where in is no water: do right well appear to be spoken of
these pore e^presoned sowlys whom christ after his bitter passion by his
precyouse blood wherwyth he consecrated his church in his new testament /
delivered out of the lake of fire wherein they lay bounde^ for their synnys.
But now is there no man y^ dowteth whyther christ delivered the dampened sowlis
out of hell or not. For in y^ hell is there no redempcyon / and in limbo patrum
the sowlys were in rest. Wherefore it appears clearly that those ^soners whom
he brought owte of their pain / he brought only owte of purgatory: And so se
these heretyques purgatory clerly proved by the plain wordys of this holy
prophet.

A another place is there also in the old testament that putteh purgatory quyte
out of questyon. For what is playnner then the places which in the book of the
Machabees make mencyon / of the deuowt remembrance / prayoure / almoyse / and
sacryfyce / to be done for sowlys when the good and holy man Judas Machabeus
gathered money among the people to by sacryfyce wythall to be offered up for y^
sowlys of them that were deed in the battle. Does not this place of scripture
so openly declare the need that we sowlys have in purgatory / and the relyefe
that we find by the prayour and suffragys of good people upon earth / that all
the heretyques that bark so fast against us / can find neither gloss nor
color to the contrary?

What shyfte find they here? surely a very shameless shyfte / and are feign
to take them to that take lynge that is their shote anchor allway / when they
find the storm so great that they se their ship goth all to wrekk. For first
they use to set some false gloss to the text that is laid against them / and
deny the right sense.

But now if the text be so plain that they can have no such color: then
when they can have no more hold but se that their part goth all to naught /
they fall to a shameless boldness and let no to deny the scripture and all /
and say y^ hole scripture which is laid against them is none holy scripture at
all / as Luther playth with the godly epistle of Crystys blyssed apostle saint
Iamys. And even the same do those heretykes with the authoryte of this holy
book of Machabees: they be not ashamed to say that yt is not scripture. But
upon what grownd do they deny yt for scripture / because yt is not found^ and
accounted for holy scripture among y^ Iewys? They neither do nor can deny but
that yt is taken for holy scripture by the church of Christ. For if they would
deny / that both the hole church bears wytnes against them at this day / and
it also appears plainly by saint Hyerome / saint Austayn / and other old holy
doctors / that the church so took yt also in their days and before: the^ would
we gladly wit of these new men these enmyes we mean of ours / whyther the
church of crist be not of as great authoryte and as much to be believed in the
choice and eleccyo^ of holy scripture as the Jews. If they will say yes: the^
answer they them self: for then is the book of the Machabees by y^ choice of
the church prouyd holy scripture though the Jews never accounted yt so. Now if
they will say no / and will contend that yt cannot be accountyd holy scripture
though the church of Christ so take take yt / but if the Jews so took yt too:
then go they nere to put out saint Iha^ns gospel out of scripture too / for
the Jews never took yt for none. And surely if they admyt for scripture that
book that the Jews admytted / and deny that book to be scripture which the
church of Christ receives for scripture: the^ do they say that the spyryte of
god was more effectually present and assyste^t unto the synagoge of the Iewys
in the law of his prophet Moses / the^ unto the church of his own only
bygoten son in the law of crystys gospel.

If they consider well the books of y^ Machabeys / they shall find such thing
therein as may give them good occasyon to put little dowte but that yt should
be of great and undeniable authoryte. For they shall find there that the
great good and godly valiant capytayne of goddys people did instytute and
ordain the great feste of the dedycacyon of the temple of Jerusalem called
festu^ encemoru^ of the annual instytucyon / of which feste we read no where
else but in y^ book of the Machabeys. And yet find we that feste ever after
continued and had in honor until crystes own days / and our savior him
self went to the celebracyon of that same feste / as appears in the gospel
of saint Iha^n. So that yt may well appear that ye bokys of that noble hystory
whereof remeaneth so noble a monument and remembrance / contynually kept and
reserved so long after / and honowred by crystes own precyouse person and
testyfyed by his holy Euangelyste in the book of his holy gospel: can not be
but undoubted truth and of dyuyne authoryte.

And surely if they deny ye book of the Machabeys for holy scripture because
the Iewys account yt not for such: then shall they by the same reason refuse
the authoryte of the book of Sapyence / and prove them self insypyentys. And
like wise if they take all scripture bysyde the new testament to be of none
other force and authoryte then yt is accomptyd in the rule and canon of the
Jews: then shall the hole psalter of Dauyd the very sum of clear and light
some prophesyes / leese among them great part of his authoryte / sith yt is
not taken in like force and strenght among the Jews as yt is in Crystys church.

Fynall for the book of the Machabees / sith the church of Christ accounts yt
for holy scripture: there can no man dout thereof but he that will take away
all credence and authoryte from the hole scripture of god the very gospellys
and all. For if these heretykys deny for holy scripture any book that the
church of Christ accounteh for holy scripture: then deny they one of the
grettyst foundacyons of all cryste^ faith / and the thing which their master
Marten Luther him self has all ready confessed for true. For he affyrmyth him
self that god has given unto the church of Christ that gift / that the
church cannot fail surely and certeynly to discern between the wordys of god
and the wordys of men: and yt yt cannot be desceyuyd in the choice of holy
scripture and reiectyng of the contrary: so farforth that he co^fessyth as he
nedys must of necessyte / that the noble doctor and gloryouse confessor saint
Austeyne says very well / when he said that he should not have believed the
gospel but for ye authorite of ye church. For he had not known which had been
the very book of the gospels and which not among so many as were written / but
by the authoryte of the church / whom the spyryte of god assysted as yt ever
does and ever shall / in the choice and receyuyng of holy scripture and
reieccyo^ of the cou^terfete and false. Whereby yt apperyth clearly not only by
that holy doctor saint Austeyn / but also by the confession of ye arche
heretyke Luther him self / that the church cannot be dysseyuyd in the choice
of holy scripture and reieccyon of the contrary: so farforthe yt yt neither can
receive as holy scripture any book that is none / nor reject for other then
holy scripture any book that is holy scripture in deed. And surely if the
church might so be deceyuyd in the choice of holy scripture / that they
might take and approve for holy scripture any book that were none: then stood
all crystendome in dout and vnsurety / whether saint Iha^ns gospel were holy
scripture or not / and so forth of all the new testament.

And therefore sith as we have showed you by the heretykes own confessyons /
the church of Christ cannot be deceyuyd in the choice and eleccyon of holy
scripture / by which their confession they must nedys abide and not flyt
therfro / as they daily do change and vary from their own words in many
other thyngis / except that they will in the falling from that point refuse
the stre^ghte and authoryte of the new testament of christ: and sith as your
self well perceyueth also the church of christ receives and takes and (as
ye se by saint Hyerome and other old holy doctors this thowsande year) has
approved and fermely byleued the holy book of the Machabeys to be one of the
volumes of holy scripture: and then in that book ye se so manyfestely purgatory
proved / that none heretyque as shameless as they be can yet for shame say the
contrary / but are by the plain and open wordys of that holy book so dreuen up
to y^ hard wall / that they can no ferther but are feign to say that the book
is no part of scripture / which shyfte they must nedys forsake again or
else revoke their own wordys and therwyth also thauthoryte of all crystes
gospel: there shall if either reason or shame can hold / never need any
ferther thing for the proof of purgatory to stop y^ mowthys of all the
heretyques that are or shall be to the worldys end.

But yet sith they be so hamelesse and unreasonable that the thing which they
can in no wise defend / they can not yet find in their proud heart to give
over / but when yt is prouyd by diverse plain textis of y^ old testament /
then having no probable reason for their part they never the more give place
to truth / but stykke to their obstynate nay: let us se whyther our purpose
be not preued by good and substancyall authoryte in the new testament also.

And first let us consider the wordys of the blessed apostle and eua^gelyst
saint Iha^n / where he says: Est peccatu^ vsque ad morte^ non dico vt pro to
roget quis. There is says he some sin that is unto the death / I bydde not
that any man shall pray for that. This sin as the interpreters agree / is
understood of desperacyon and impenytens: as though saint Iha^n would say /
yt who so depart out of this world impenite^t or in despair / any prayour
after made ca^ never stand him instead. Then appears yt clearly that saint
Iha^n means that there be other which dye not in such case for whom he would
men should pray / because y^ prayour to such sowlys may be profitable. But that
profit can no man take neither being in heaven where yt needs not / nor being
in hell where yt boteth not. Wherefore it appears plain yt such prayour
helps only for purgatory: which they must therefore nedys grant / except
they deny saint Iha^n.

What say they to the wordys of saint Iha^n in the fyfte chapyter of the
Apocalypse: I have hard says he every creature that is in heaven and upon the
yerth and under the yerthe and that be in the sea and all thyngys that be in
them / all these have I hard say: benedyccyon and honor and glory and power
for ever / be to him that is syttyng in the trone / and unto the lamb.

Now wotteth every man well / that in hell among damnyd soulys is there none
that gives glory to Criste for the redempcyon of man. For they for anger that
by their own defaut they have lost their perte thereof / and cannot for proud
heart take their faut to them self / fall to blasphemy as the devil does him
self / and impute their sin to the faut of goodys grace / and their damnacyon
to the blame of his creacyo^. So that the praise and glory that is given by
creatures in hell unto the lamb for mannys redempcyon / is only by the sowlys
in purgatory / that be and shall be partyners of that redempcyon: as the
creaturys walkyng upon yerth saylynge in the se / that give the honor to
Christ for mannys redempcyon / be only the christian people which look and hope
to be parteners thereof / and not infydels that believe yt not. But the blessed
creaturis in heaven give honor to Criste for mannys redempcyon / for that joy
and pleasure that their charity takes in the socyete and felyshyp of saved
souls. And in this place yt is a world to se the folly of some heretykys /
what euasyon they seek to void from this place of scripture. They sey that yt
is no more to be understood by sowlys here in purgatory nor christian men
living upon earth / then by fyshes in the sea and the dyuell and damnyd soulys
in hell: because the text says that every creature in these and in hell spoke
that laud and honor to the lamb. But by this wise way might they preue / that
when ye pray for all christian sowlys / ye mean to pray for our Ladies souly and
for Judas too: and that our savior when he sent his apostles and bad them
preche his gospel to every creature / they may bear you in hand that he bad
the^ preche to oxen and keen and their caluys to / because all they be
creaturis. But as they were sent to none other creature / then such as he
me^t of though he spoke of all / nor ye mean to pray for no soulys but such
as have need and may have help though ye speak of all: so though saint Iha^n
spoke of every creature in hell geuyng honor to Christ for mannys redempcyon /
yet meant he but such as be in the hell in which they rejoice therein and shall be
parteners thereof / which be only we in purgatory / and not the dyuels and
damnyd soulys yt blaspheme him though their just ponishme^te redownd against
their will to the glory of goddys ryghtuousnes.

If all this will not satysfye them / will ye se yet a another clear place and
such as none heretyque can avoid? Does not the blessed apostle saint Peter as
appears in y^ secu^d chapter of y^ apostles acts / say of our savior christ
in this wise: Que^ deus suscitauit solutis doloribus inferm: In these words he
shows that paynys of hell were losed. But these paynys were neither paynys of
that hell in which the dampened sowlys be payned / which nether were losed then
nor never be losed / but be and shall be as our savior says him self
everlasting: nor these paynys y^ were than losed were not y^ paynys in limbo
patrum / for there were none to be losed / for the good soulys were there as
our savior shows him self in quiet cumforte and rest. And so appears yt
euyde^tly / that the paynys of hell that were losed / were only the paynys of
purgatory which is also called hell by occasyon of the latin word and the greek
word both. For in these tongys for as much as before the resurreccyon of our
savior christ there was never none y^ ascended up in to heaven) there was no
people that any otherwise spoke of sowlys / then that they were gone down byneth
in to the low place. And therefore in the wordys of the come^ creed is yt said
of our savior christ after his passion: descendit ad inferna: that is to say
he descended down byneth in to the low placys. Instead of which low placys
the english tongue has ever used this word hell. And certain is yt and very
sure / that christ descended not in to all these low placys / nor in to every
place of hell / but only in to lymbus patrum and purgatory. Which two placys
because they be partys of habytacyons of sowlys byneth (all which habytacyons
byneth have in english been allway called hell) therefore are these two placys
among other taken and comprehended under y^ name of hell. Which word hell
nothing else sygnyfyeth unto us in his general sygnyfycacyon / but y^
habytacyons of sowlys byneth or under us in y^ low placys under y^ ground. Albe
yt because limbus patrum and purgatory be called in english also by their
special namys beside: therefore is most comenly this word hell restayned to
the special sygnyfycacyon of that low place byneth in which the dampened souls
be punyshed. This much have we showed you of this word hell / because we would
not that the comen taking thereof might bring you in to any error. So that by
this place ye se preued by the plain wordys of saint Peter / that christ at
his resurreccyon did lose and vnbynd paynys in hell / which as we have showed
you coud be no where there but in purgatory. For in the special hell of damned
sowlys y^ pains were not losed. And in lymbus patru^ was no pains to be
losyd. And therefore except they deny saint Peter / they cannot deny purgatory.

And yet if they deny saint Peter: we shall then allege the^ saint Poule /
whom they be best content to here of / because that of the dyffyculte of his
writing / they cach sumtyme some matter of co^tencyon for the deffe^ce of their
false exposycyo^. This blyssed apostle in his furst epistle to the Corynthyes
the third chapyter speaking of our sauyoure Christ the very foundacyon and the
only foundacyon of all our faith and salvation: says: If any man bylde upon
this foundacyon gold / silver / ^cyouse stonys / wood / hay / or straw: every
ma^nys work shall be made open / for the day of our lord shall declare yt / for
in the fire yt shall be showed / and the fire shall prove what manner of thing
every ma^nys work is. If any ma^nys work yt he has bylded thereon do abide: he
shall have a reward. If any ma^nys work burn: he shall suffer harm / but he
shall be safe / but yet as by fire. In these words y^ apostle shewith y^
likewise as sum me^ abydyng upon criste and his very lively faith / bylde up
theruppo^ such good works as are so good and so pure yt they be like fine gold
/ fine silver / or such fine ^cyous stonys / as when they be cast in the fire
yt ca^ find no fyfth to fech out of the^ / and therefore they remayn in the
fire safe and vnmynyshed: so ar there sum on the the other side / which though they
do not as many other do / with mortal synnys and lak of good works / wound
their faith unto y^ death and fall fro criste the fundacyon that they must byld
upon: yet do they abydyng upon yt fu^dacyon / byld up theruppon many such
simple and frail and corruptyble works as can never enter heaven. And such be
venial synnys / as idle wordys / vain and wa^ton mirth / and such other
thyngys like: which be but like wood / hay / or straw. Which work^ when the
soul after his departing out of the world brings hither into purgatory: he
cannot so get through yt as does the soul whose wurkes were wrought clean or
fully purged by penance ere he dyed. For yt soul in the fire can feel no harm
/ like as fine gold can in y^ fire nothing lose of his weight. But this soul
yt brings with him such frail workys either wrought by the^ self or insertyd
peradventure and myxyd a myddys of sum good and virtuous wurk / as for
e^sample sum lak peradventure suffycie^te attencyon and head taken by su^
sodayn waueryng of the mind in time of prayouce / or some surrepcyo^ and
k^epyng in of vain glory and lykyng of their own praise in their alms given
or other good deed done / not forthewith resysted and cast out / but kept
and fed upon to long / and yet neither so long paraduenture nor so great
as our lord will for that thought depryue him the merit and reward of his
work: lo in such casys as the apostle says the day of our lord which is to
the hole world the day of the general judgment and to every man particular /
the day of his own judgment after his death / shall show his work what manner
thing yt is: the fire shall prove and declare. For here in purgatory like as
the fire ca^ in the clean sowlys take none hold / but they shall be theryn
without any manner pain or gryefe: so shall yt in the sowlys that are
vnclensyd and have their wurk^ imperfyte unclean and spottyd: hastily catch /
hold and keep them fast and burn the^ with incessaunt pain: till the
fylthynes of their sin be clean purged and gone / and yt shall be in sum sener
in sum later / as their synnys or the spott^ remaynyng thereof be more easy or
more hard to get out. And yt is the thing y^ Poule sygnyfyeth by ye wood / hay
/ and straw of which the tone is a light flame sone endede, y^ tether
smowdreth (...) and the third is hoteste and endures lengest. But yet has
(...) an end / and so shall have at length all the paynys of them y^ shall be
purged here. But what so ever soul misshappe to die in dedely (...) and
impenytent: sith he is thereby fallen of for ever from our savior christ / yt
was his funda^yo^ and has byelded up wreched (...) upon your (...) enemy the
deuyllwherwhyth he has so (...) poysend him self that he can never be purged:
the fire shall therefore lie burmyng upon him for ever / and his pain never
lessed nor his fylthy spottys never the more mynyshed.

And for as much as ye never can conceive a very right imagynacyon of these
thyngys which ye never felt / nor yt is not possible to find you any example
in the world very like unto the paynys that sely sow^rs feel when they be
departed thense: we shall therefore put you in remembrance of one kind of
pain / which though yt be nothing like for the quantyte of the matter yet may
yt somewhat be resemb^^d be reason of the fassyon and manner. If there were
enbarked many people at onys to be by ship conuayed a long journey by se of
such as never came thereon before and should hap all the way to have the ^^^ryse
high and sore wrought and sometime sone upon a storm to (...) long after
walowyng at an anchor: there should ye find diverse f^^syons of folk. Some
peradventure but of them very few / so clean from all evil humors and so
well attempred of them self / that they shall be all that long vyage by see as
lusty and as ^ocunde as if they were on land. But far the most part shall
ye se sore syk / (...) in many sundry manner some more / some less / some
longer time dyseased and some myche sooner amended. And diverse that a while had
went they should have dyed for pain / yet after ons vomyte or twain so clean
rydde of their gryefe / that they never feel dyspleasure of yt after. And this
happeth after as the body is more or less dysposed in yt self thereto. But
then shall ye sometime se there some other whose body is so incurably corrupted
/ that they shall walter and tolte^ and wring their handys / and gnash the
teeth / and their eyes water / their head ake^ their body frete / their stomach
wamble / and all their body shyuer for pain / and yet shall never vomete at
all: or if they vomyte / yet shall they vomyte still and never find ease
thereof. Lo thus fares yt as a small thing may be rese^bled to a great by the
soulys deceaced and departed the world: that such as be clean and unspotted can
in the fire feel no disease at all / and on the the other side such as come
thense so dedely poisoned with sin / that their spottys been indelyble and
their fylthynes vnpourgeable / lie f^etynge and fryenge in the fire for ever.
And only such as neither be fully cleansed nor yet sore defiled but that the
fire may frete out the spottys of their sin: of this sort only be we yt
here lie in purgatory / which these cruel heretyques would make you believe
that we feel none harm at all: whereof the blee^syd apostle as we have showed
you wryteh unto the Corynthyes the contrary.

Now if they would bear you in hand that because some doctors do co^ster
those wordys of thappostle in diverse other sensys / as they do conster in
diverse sensys almost every text in scripture / sometime after the letter /
sometime moral and sometime other wise / and all to the profit and edyfye^g of
the herers: if these heretyques would therefore pretend that saint Poule in that
placement nothing of purgatory / but the fire that shall be sent before the dome
/ or worldely trybulacyon / or some such other thing: ye shall well
understand that though his wordys may be veryfyed and well and profytably
applied unto such thyngys also / yet lets that nothing these wordys to be
proprely by saint Poule spoken of purgatory / no more the^ yt lets these
words to be proprely spoken by christ: Ego in flagella paratus sum: and many
an other verse in y^ psalter also / though y^ same wordys may be well applied
and veryfyed of many an other man offrynge him self pacyently to the
sufferaunce of unjust punyshement. And therefore lest these heretyques should
with any such inuencyons bygyle you and make you believe / yt we for the
furtherau^ce of our own cause expoune y^ apostles words wrong and so make
them seem to say for our part: ye shall understand that those wordys have
been expowned and understood of purgatory this thowsande year and more by y^
ancient holy doctors of crystys church as well grekys as latyns. And among
other the great clerk Orygene in mo placys of his wurkys then one / declares
plainly that the before remembered words of the apostle / are spoken by y^
paynis of purgatory. The holy confessor and great pyller of cristys church
saint Austayne / in diverse of his godly and erudite bokys / expowneth that
place of saint Poule to be clearly spoken of purgatory. And over this the
blessed Pope saint Gregory in the fourth book of his godly dyalogys / bears
witness that the apostle in the place aforesaid wrote those wordys of
purgatory. So that ye may plainly perceive that this exposycyon is neither our
deuyce no any new founde^ fantesy / but a very truth well perceived and
wytnessed by great conyng men and holy blessed saints more then a thousand
year ago.

Now if these heretyques will be so mad to flyt in this case from saint Poule
/ and say they be bounden to believe nothing but only y^ gospel: let. us the^
yet see ferther whyther we may not plainly prove you purgatory by y^ very
wordys of the gospel self. Does not our blyssed sauyoure him self say that
there is a certain sin which a man may so commyt against the holy ghost / yt
yt shall never be remyttyd nor forgyuen neither in this world nor in the world
to (...) Now as for to dyspute what manner sin that should be / both y^ matter
were very hard / and also we shall here nothing need to touch yt. But of one
thing both ye and we may make us very sure / that there is nor ca^ be any sin
committed in the world so sore / so greuouse / nor so abomynable / but that if
a man wurk with goddys ^^race by co^try cyon and heaviness of heart / with humble
confession of mouth and good endeavor of penance and satysfaccyon in deed /
against his thought word and deed by which god was offended / he shall obtayn
of gods goodness remyssyen / forgyuenes / and pardon.

But yt may paraduenture so befall that by sum kind of unkindness ^syd toward
god exte^dyng to the blasphemy of his holy spirit / the co^mytter of yt sin
may so far offend / that he shall for his desert and demeryte have y^ grace of
almighty god so clearly wythdrawn from him / that our lord shall never offer
his grace after / nor never more call upon him. And then his grace onys
clearly wythdrawen from a man: he can never be able to repent and return again
to god. For grace is y^ light where with men se y^ way to walk out of sin: and
grace is the staf without help whereof no man is able to rise out of sin:
according to the wordys of holy wrytt spoken to man in the parson of our lord
god: Exte perditio tua / e^me saluatio tua: Thy perdycyon cu^meth of thy self /
but thy salvation cummeth of me by y^ aid and help of my grace. Which grace as
we tell you being fro sum man utterly wythdrawn for sum ma^^^ unkind behauour
toward god and blasphemy against the holy ghost / that sin for lak of
repentance which can never cum where grace is clean gone / shall never be
forgeuen in this world nor in y^ world to cu^. And in such a manner kind of
unkindness toward god and blasphemy toward the holy ghost / fall also all
such wretchys as have y^ grace of god ever calling and knokkyng upon the^ for
repentance all the days of their life: and yet all that notwyhstandynge will
not use ye nor work there with nor turn to god: but wyllyngly will dye
desperate and impenytente wretchys.

This kind of blasphemees of goddys goodness and his holy spyryte / have in y^
miserable passing of their sinful soul out of their sensual bodies the grace
of god so fully and so finally wytdrawen from them for ever: that they be
thereby fyxed and confyrmed in an unchangeable malice / which eternally
dwelling with them / is the very special cause of their everlasting
turment. But in this matter as we said we wade owte of our purpose / saving
that yt seemed us yet necessary / sith our savior in the place that we speak of
does him self show that there is a certain sin so to wchynge the holy
gooste that it shall never by forgyuen neither in this world nor in the world
to come: yt seemed as we say some what necessary to say sum what theryn / lest
sum that read yt might conceive a wrong opynion and a false fere drawyng them
toward dyspayre / that if they myshappenyd (which our lord forbede) to fall
in to blasphemy against the holy gooste / they coud never after be forgeuen how
sore so ever they repentyd / or how heartily and how bysely so ever they should
pray therefore. In which thing sith we have showed you what we take for
troth: we shall leave that matter and show you how those wordys of Christ prove
you our pryncypall purpose / that is to say that there is a purgatory. How be
yt we shall scan^ly need to show you that: for the very wordys be plain and
euydent of them self. For when our lord says that the blaphemy against the
holy ghost shall not by forgeuen nether in this world nor in the world to come
/ he gives us clear knowledge that of other synnys sum shall be forgeuen in this
world and sum in the world to come.

Now ar there in this world every sin forgeuen in such as shall be saved
sowles / except such venyall synnys and such te^porall pain as yet due to the
dedely synnys / rest and remayn to be purged here in purgatory. For none other
place is there then this in the world to cum after mannys life / in which
either sin or pain dew to any sin shall be remitted. For in to heaven shall
neither sin nor pain enter: and in hell shall never none be releasyd. And
therefore when Christ by showing that sum kind of sin shall not be remyttyd
in the world to cum: does give men knowledge that on the the other side sum synnys
shall in the world to come be remytted and forgeuen. And then sith no man
douteth but that neither in hell shall any synnys by forgeuen nor in heaven:
very reason techyth that the place in which some synnys shall be forgeuen after
this life / can be none other but purgatory.

There is as we suppose no cryste^ man living / but he will thynk that any one
place of holy scripture is enough to the proof of any truth. Now have we
prouyd you purgatory by the plain textis of mo places tha^ one two or three.
And yet shall we give you a another so plain as we suppose and so euyde^t for
the proof of purgatory / as none heretyke shall find any good color of
escape. For our sauyoure Christ says as yt is rehersyd in the.xii. chapyter
of Matthew / that men shall yield a rekenyng of every idle word / and that
shall be after this present life. Then woteth every man that by that rekenyng is
understood a punyshement therefore: which shall not be in hell / (...) much
less in heaven. And therefore can yt be no where else but in purgatory.

^o thus may ye se purgatory clearly proved by the very scripture self by the
book of the kings / by y^ prophet zachary / by the holy book of y^ Machabees,
by y^ words of saint Iha^n / by thapostle saint Peter ^by the writing of our
savior christ him self: so y^ we not a little marvel either of the ignorance
or shameless boldness of all such as having any learning / dare call them
self christian men and yet deny pargatory. For if they have learning and
perceive not these clear (...) we marvel of their ignorance. With which
white they join a proud pretense of learning / they fall in to the reprose y^
saint Poule spoke of the paynym philosophers: dicentes se esse sapien^es stulti
facti sunt: while they called them self wise they proved sturke folys. Now if
they perceive well these textys of holy scripture so plainly prouyng purgatory
/ and yet them self stykke (...) in the denyeng: we then marvel much more
that they door for shame call them self christian men / and then deny the
thing which the blssyd apostles of christ / y^ sacred majesty of our savior
christ him self / in the holy scripture / in his holy gospellys / so
manefestely and so playnele affyrmeth.

And yet many an other plain text is there in holy scripture / y^ as the old
holy doctors bear witness well proves our purpose for purgatory / which we
speak here nothing of / sith fewer textys the^ we have all ready showed you /
both might and ought to suffyce you. For any one plain text of scripture
suffyseth for the porfe of any troth / except any man be of the mind / that
he will have god tell his (...) wise ere^he believe him.

Now if th^se heretyques fall to their accustumed frowardness and as they be
wont to do will rather deny that the swa^ne is white and the crow blakke / then
agree that any text in holy scripture has any other sense then them self
list to say / and will in this point for the meyntenaunce of their heresye
set at naught saint Austayn / saint Hyerome / saint Ambrose / saint Gregory /
saint Chrysosteme / saint Basyle / saint Cypryane / and finally all the old
holy fathers and blessed sayntys that any thing say against them: yet can
they neither deny that the catholyque church of christ has allwaye byleued
purgatory / condempnyng for heretyques all such as would hold the contrary.
Nor if they grant that: can they then by any manner mean avoid yt / but that
the thing is true that all the church so full and hole so long has in such
wise byleued / all though there were not founden in all holy scripture one
text y^ so plainly proved yt: as they might find many that seemed to say the
contrary / except they will not only say that our blessed lady lost her
vyrginite after the birth of christ / but over yt be dreue^ ferther to mynyshe
the stre^ght and authoryte of the very gospel self: which if the church may
err in the right faith / had clearly lost his credence.

And therefore as we say / where as we by plain scripture have prouyd you
purgatory: yet if there were theryn not one text yt any thing seemed to say for
yt / but diverse and many textys which as far seemed unto the mysse
understanders to speak against purgatory / as many diverse textys of y^
gospel appeared unto the great heretyque Eluidius to speak against the
perpetual vyrgynyte of crystys blessed mother: yet sith the catholyque church
of christ has allway so fermely byleued yt for a plain trowthe / that they
have allway taken the obstynate affermers of y^ contrary for plain erronyouse
heretyques / yt is a proof full and suffycyent for purgatory to any man that
will be taken for a member of crystys church / and is alone a thing suffycyent
in any good christian and ye^ce to stop the mowthys of all the proud high
hearted malycyouse heretykes / that any thing would bark against us.

But when they be so confuted and concluded / that they have nothing to say:
yet ca^ they not hold their peace / but fall to blasphemy and ask why there
comes none of us owte of purgatory and speak with them. By which
blasphemouse questyon they may as well deny hell and heaven to / as they deny
purgatory. For there comes as many to them out of purgatory / as out of either
of the other ^wayn. And surely if there came one owte of any of them all three
/ unto folk of such incredulyte as those heretyque ^e: yet would they be
never the better. For if they believe not now them whom they (...) believe / no
more would they believe him neither that should come owte of purgatory to tell yt
them: as Abraam answered the rych man that requyred^ the same in hell / and as
yt well appeared also by the myscreaunte Iewys which were so little amended by
the coming again of lazare owte of lymbus patrum / that lest other should
believe him they devised to destroy him. And yet if the thing that they require
would content them: yt has not lakked. For there has in every country and in
every age apparycyons been had and well known and testyfyed / by which men
have had suffycyent reuelacyon and proof of purgatory / except such as list
not to believe them: and they be such as would be never the better if they saw
them.

For who so lysteth to believe that all to gether is lies that he hereth so much
people speak of and sees so many good men write of: for no cu^trey is there in
cryste^dome in which he shall not here credably reported of such apparycyo^s
diverse tymys there seen and apperyng / and in the bokis of many an holy saints
writing / shall he find such apparycyons in such wise told and testyfyed / as
no good man coud in any wise mystrust them: and over this when the apostles at
Crystes apperyng to the.xi. in the house / took him at the furst for a spyryte
/ yt well apperyth that apparycyons of spyrytes was no new thing among y^
Iewys: which ye may well parceyue also by y^ y^ better sort of the^ said i^
excusing of saint Poule / what if some angel or some spyryt have spoken to him
as is mencyoned in the apostles actys: so that as we say who so list to take
all this for lies / and is so faythlesse and so proudly curyouse that he looks
ere he believe them to have such apparycyons specially showed unto him self and
miracles wrought in his presens: would war y^ wurse and he saw them / and would
ascrybe yt either to some fantasy or to the dyuels workis / as did those Jews
that ascrybyd Crystys miracles to Belzabub.

For surely if such people were in the case of saint Thomas of Inde / that
they were otherwise very virtuous and good / having in that only point some
hardness of belefe as he had in Cristes resurreccyo^: our lord we dout not would
of his special goodness provide sum specyell way for their satysfaccyon to
recover them with. But now sith they be plain carnal high hearted and
malycyouse / lo^gyng for miracles as did these crooked hearted Jews / which
said unto Christ y^ they longed to se him show sum miracle. he does therefore
with these folk as Christ did with them. For as he answered them by the sample of
Jonas the prophet / that he would none show before yt pu^^se and faythlesse
people till he were deed: so answers he these peruers and crooked malycyous
people / yt he will show the^ no such apparycions till they be deed. And then
shall he send them where they shall sent so surely / and to their pain se such
a grysly sight as shall so grieve their hartys to look thero^ / that they shall
say as Criste said to saint Thomas of Inde: Beatiqui no^ viderunt et
crediderunt: Blessed and happy be they that believed this gere and never saw yt.
For surely in this world y^ goodness of god so te^peryth such apparycyo^s / as
his high wisdom sees yt most profitable for help and relief of the deed and
instruccyon and amendment of the quyk: keeping such apparycyo^s of his great
marcy most comenly from y^ sight of such as would turn his godnes in to their
own harm. And surely of his tender favor toward you / does his great
goodness provide: that such apparycyons / reuelacyons / and miracles / should not
be to copyouse and commune: whereby good men seeing the thing at eye / should
lose the great part of that they now merit by faith: aid evil folk when
they were onys famelyer with yt / would then as little regard yt as they now
little believe yt.

Now it is a world to see with what folly they fortefy their false belyefe /
and in to what fond fantesyes they fall / while they declyne from the troth.
For while they deny purgatory / they now afferm / and specially Luther him
self) that souls unto doomys day do nothing else but sleep. Woe would they be if
they fell in such a sleep as many a soul slepeth here / and as Judas has all
ready slept.xv. C. year in hell.

Then say they that if there were any purgatory / out of which the pope might
deliver any soul by his pardon: the^ were he very cruel in that he delyueryth
them not without money: a also that he ryddyth them not hense all to gether at
onys. The furst is a great folly that sith our lord sendyth them thither for
satysfaccyon to be made in sum manner for their sin: the pope should rather
against goddys purpose deliver them fre / then change the manner of their
satysfaccyon from pain into prayour / alms deed / or other good workys to be
done by their frend^ for them in some point profitable and necessary for the
hole corpse of crystendome or some good member of the same.

Now is there in the second not only much more folly / but yt imports also
plain and open blasphemy. For presupposed that the pope may deliver all sowlys
out of purgatory: yet if he were therefore cruel as often as he leueth any there
/ th^s unreasonable reason lays cruelte to y^ blame of god / which may
undoubtedly deliver all sowlys this and yet he leueth the^ there. This blasphemy
should also to which his high majesty for keeping any soul in hell / from whens no
man douteth but that he might if he list deliver them all for ever. But as he
will not deliver any thens: so will he not without good order deliver any soul
hence. For as of his justice they be worthy to ly there for ever: so be we
worthy to lie here for the while / and in god no cruelte though he suffer his
mercy to be co^munely suspendyd and temperyd with the balaunce of his justice.
And though he take us not hence all at onys orderlesse and at adventure: his
high wisdom is praise worthy and not worthy blame. Our lord forbede y^ ever we
so should and such is his grace y^ we never shall for any pain possible y^ we
can suffer here / hold our self co^te^t to here such folysh words as e^ply so
plain blasphemy against goddys high marcyfull majesty. For surely these folk in
puttyng forth of this their unwise argument / make a cou^tetenaunce to throw yt
against the pope / but in very deed they cast ye at goddys head.

For as for the pope who so consider yt well / goes forther from the sample of
god that is set for crystes vycar in his church by geuyng over lyberall pardon:
tha^ by being theryn to scarce and straight. For god remytteth not here at
adventure though he may do his pleasure / but observes right good and great
respect / as the prayours and intercessyons made for us or other satysfaccyon
done for us by some other men. And this order uses and of reason ought to use
his vycar also in the dyspensynge toward our relyefe / the precyouse treasure
of our comfort that christ has put in his keeping. For else if other the
pope or god should always forthwith deliver every man here / or rather keep every
man hense as these heretyques would make men believe that god does in deed / and
would that the world should so take yt: the^ should god or the pope as we
somewhat have said before / give a great occasyon to men bordely to fall in
sin / and little to care or force how slowly they rise again. Which thing
neither were mete for the popys office / nor agreeable to the great wisdom of
god / and myche less mete for his marcy. For by that mean should he give
innumerable folk great occasyon of damnacyon / which presumyng upon such
easy short remissyon / would lustely draw to lewdenes with little care of
amendment.

And so appears yt that the thing which these wise men would have ye take
for cruel / is of tre^th most merciful: and the thing which they would have
to seem very benygne and pytyouse is in very deed most rygorouse and most
cruel: like wise as a sharp master that chastyseth his servant / is in that
point more favorable tha^ is an easy one that for lakke of punyshement lets
them run on the bridle and gives them occasyon of hanging / Which thing
has place also between the father and the child / And therefore in holy
scripture that father is not accounted for vnlouyng and cruel / that beteth
his child / but rather he that leueth yt undone. For he that spares the rod
says holy wrytt hates the child. / And god thefore that is of all fathers the
most tyder / loving / and most benygne and merciful / leueth no child of his
uncorrected: but scourges every child that he takes to him. And therefore
neither god remytteth at adventure the paynys of purgatory: nor no more must
the pope nether / but if that he will while he labors to do good and be
pytuouse to us that are deed / be cruel and do much more harm to them that
be quyk: and while he will draw us owte of purgatory / drive many of them in to
hell. From desire of which kind of help / we so far abhor / that we would
all rather chose to dwell here long in most bitter pain / than by such way to
get hense as might give occasyon of any man's damnacyon.

Now where they likewise obiecte in countenance against the clergy / but yet
in very deed they stryke the stroke at us whom they would byreue the suffragys
of good people / obiectynge that no man may satysfye for a another / nor that
the prayour nor almoyse nor other good deed done by one man may stand a another
instead / but y^ every man must nedys all thing y^ he will have help of / do
it every whyt him self / and so that no ma^nys good deed done among you for
us in relyefe of our pain could in any manner serve us: this oppinyon as yt is
toward us very pestylent and pernycyouse / so is yt of yt self very false and
folysshe. For first if all that ever must avail any man / must nedys be
done by him self / and no mannys merit may be applied to the help of a
another / then were wyped a way from all men all the merytys of crystys bitter
passion / in which though yt be true that god dyed on the cross because of the
unite of god and man in person / yet had his tender manhed all the pain for us
/ and his impassyble godhed felt no pain at all / Whereof serves also ye
prayours that every man prays for other? Wherefore did saint Powle pray for
all other criste^ men / and desire them all to pray for him also and each of
them for other / that they might be saved?

And why is there so special a mencyon made in the actys of the apostles /
that at the delivery of saint Peter out of prison / ye church made contynuall
prayour and intercessyon for him? but for to show that god the rather
delivered him for other me^nys prayours. And think ye that if god have pity
upon one man for an others sake / and delyuereth him at a another mannys
petycyon from a little pain or prysonement in the world there upon earth: he
has not at other me^nys humble and hearty prayour myche more pytye upon such
as lie in myche more heavy pain and turment here in the hot fire of purgatory?

Then find these folk a another knotte hard as they think to undo. For they
say yt if a another ma^nys merytys may serve me / whereto should I need to do any
good my self. This obieccyon is much like as if they would say if other men may
take me out of ye fire: whereto should I labor to rise my self. Very truth yt
is that sometime the good wurkes of one man wrought with good affection / may
purchase an other man grace for to mende and wurke for him self. But surely of
come^ course he that will not him self wurk with them / geteth little good
of other mennys good dedys. For if thy self do still draw bakward while other
good men with their prayour labor to pull the forward: yt will be long ere
thou make any good days journey. And therefore ye holy doctor saint Austayne /
in ye blessed book that he made of the cure and care that men should have of us
sely parted sowlys: towcheth quykly the very point that there can none take
profit of other mennys good dedys / but only such as have deserved by some
good thing in their own dedys / that other mennys dedys should help them:
and that has every men done at the least wise by his fynall repentance and
purpose of amendment / that departs the world in the state of grace.

For he that is owte of that state / can not take the profit of other mennys
merytys done for him. And therefore damned soulys can not by other mennys
merytys be delivered of damnacyon: nor in likewise he that entendeth to
perseruer in sin and do no good for him self. But sith that we be not in y^
case / but have with help of gedd^ grace deserved to be parteners of such good
dedys as ye that are our fre^d^ will of your goodness do for us: ye may by your
meryt^ hyghly releue us here and help to get us hense. And surely great
wonder were yt if we should not be able to take profit of your prayours. For
there will no wise man dowte but that the prayour of any member of cristendom
may pro^yte any other that yt is made for / which has need and is a member of
the same. But none is there yet living that is more very member of crystys
mystycall body y^ is his church then we be^ nor no man living that has more
need of help the^ we. Form surety of salvation we be fellows with angellys: in
need of relyefe we be yet fellows with you. And therefore being so sure members
of one body with angels holy ^aymys / and you: and having nece^syte both of
their help and yours: there is no dowte but sith every member that need both
may take good by other / we stand in the case that both aungells and sayntys
intercessyons and your good prayours and almoyse deed done for us what so ever
these heretyques babble may do us meruaylouse much good.

How many have by godd most aracyouse favor appeared unto their frendys after
the death and showed them self helped and delivered hense by pilgrymage
almoyse deed / and prayour / and special by the sacred ob^^cyon of that holy
sacrament offered for them in the mass. If these heretyques say that all such
thyngys be lies: then be they myche wurse yet then their master was Luther
him self as long as any spark of shame was in him. For he confesses in his
sermons that many such apparycyons be true: and his heart could not nor for
very shame serve him / that so many so often told in so many placis so
faithfully reported by so many honest folk / and so sub ancya^^y written by
so many blessed saymys: should be all false. Wheryn if these men list like
lusty sholers to pass and over go their mad master in this point / and
deny these things all to gether: yet shall there styk in their teeth / y^
scripture of y^ Machabees whereof we told you that Judas Machabeus gathered and
sent a great offryna to Hyerusalem / for to bye sacrifyce to be offered for
them y^ he found slain in the field / and certain thyngys about them taken
of the Idol^ys forbeden them by the law / which caused him to fere lest they
were for their sin fallen after their death in to pain / and therefore made
that gatheryng / y^ alms and offering as him self says / that they might
thereby be losyd and delyueryd of their synnys. So that there appears plainly
by scripture / that such suffragys stand us sely soulys instead. Against
which authorite if they will with their master labor to break out and deny
that book for holy scripture / we have stopped them that gap all ready with such
a bush of thornys / as will pryk their ha^dys through a pair of hedgyng glouys
ere they pull yt out.

And finally for this point that the suffragys of the church and y^ prayours of
good christian people / stand us here in relyef and cu^fort / there needs in
this world (as saint Austayn says and saint Damascene) none other manner proof
then that all criste^dome has ever used to do so / and have thought them self
always so bounden to do / damnynge always for heretykys all them that would
afferme the contrary.

And in this point may they have a maruelose great thing against them in the
judgment of every good man the great antiquyte of the seruyse of Crystys church
/ by which the church has so long ago customably recommendyd in their prayours
all christian soulys to god. For we trust that though these heretykys find many
men both glad to here and light to believe every lewd tale that cu^ be surmysed
against the church that now is: yet trust we that they shall find few or none
so far out of all frame / but that they will at the lest believe y^ there has
been sum good and godly men wise and well learned too among the clergy in days
passed one time or other. By then to the old time and to the good men that then
were / and here what they said / and se what they did / and believe and follow
them. There remains yet and bokys ynow thereof / the very mass in the very
form and fassyon / as saint Basyle / and saint Chrysostheme / and other holy
fathers in that virtuous time said yt: in which ye shall find that in their
daily masses they prayed ever for all christian souls.

Ye shall also parceyue clearly by saint Chrisostheme in a sermon of his / that
in his time there were in the funeral service at the beryeng of the corpse /
the self same psalms songen that ye sing now at y^ dirige. Whereby yt well
appareth that yt is no new found thing: for his time was far above a. M. year
ago: and yet was y^ thing song used before his days. And because ye shall know
that the more surely: he says y^ the gyse and custume to pray for soulys / was
instytute and bygone in the church by the blessed apostles them self. And so
while so good men so long a go bygan yt / and good folk has ever synnys
continued yt / ye may sone guess whyther they be good men or no that now
provoke you to break yt.

Now where they say that if the mass could do us any good / that then the
prestys be very cruel that will say none for us but they be waged: this word
is as true as their intent is fraudule^t and false. For their purpose is in
those wordys to make the world wene / that the clergy were so couetouse and
cruel therwyth / that there will no priest pray for us pore soulys here /
without he be hired thereto: whereof our lord be thanked we find full well the
contrary. For albe yt that of Luthers prestes we can have none help / sith
their massys offer not up the sacrament to god neither for quyk nor deed / nor
make no very prestes among them sith they take pres^hed for no sacrament: yet
of good christian prestys we find great relyese as well in their dyryges and
much other suffragys by old instytucyon of the church specially said for us
though no man (...) one penny through the year. And so may all the world wit
that this word of these here tyques has myche malice and little effect
theryn.

But now thowghe the prestys pray for us of their own (...) yet when good
people desire them thereto and give them their almoyse therefore: then are
they dowble bounden / and then ryseth there myche more good and profyt upon
all sydys. For the^ take we fru^^ both of the prayour of y^ tone and the
almoyse of the the other. And the takes the priest benyfyte of his own prayour
made both for the geuer and for us. The geuer also gets fruit both of his
own (...) full almoyse / and of double prayour also / that is to wit both the
prayour of the priest that prays for us / which com^nly prays for him to /
and also the prayour of us / which with great fervor of heart pray for our
benefactours incessau^tly / and are so (...) forth in goddys undoubted favor /
that very few me^ living upon earth are so well herd as we / bysydys that of
all kind of almoyse that any man can give / the most men ^oryouse is y^ which
is bystowed upon us as well for that yt is unto the most nedy and also to
the^ that are absent and finally for that of all manner almoyse yt is most
grownded upon the foundacyon of all christian vertuose faith. For as for to pore
folk a natural man will give almoyse either. for pytye of some pytuose sight
/ or for werynesse of their imporcune. (...). But as for as pore sow^ys passed
the world / whom be that gives almoyse neither sees nor hereth: would never
bestow one penny upon us but if he had a says that we live still / and that
(...) that we lie in pain and hopyd of his reward in heaven. Which kind of
faith and good hope joined wy^h his gift and good wurck must nedys make it one
of the best kind of almoysed. de that any man can do in the world.

And sith that yt so is as in deed yt is: what vncharytable and what
unfaithful folk at these that for hatred which they ow to pres^ed / wolke make
you believe that there were no purgatory / and would rather wysh by their wyllys
that their own fathers should lie here in fire till the day of doom / then any
man should give a priest one penny to pray for them?

And yet is there here one thing well to be co^syderyd / that they rather hate
prestys for hatred of Crystes faith / then speak against purgatory for hatred
of prestys. Which thing though yt seem you derke at the furst heryng: ye shall
yet if ye look well / very well parceyue. For if it so were that this kind of
people did speak against purgatory only for y^ hatred of the pope and y^
clergy / then would they grant that saved souls at yet purged in the fire
here for their synnis vnsatysfyed in the world: and yt should then suffyce
the^ to say for their purpose / that neither pressed nor pope nor any man else
nor any ma^nys alms or prayour / can in this place of ponyshme^t any thing
releue us. For this were enough ye se well to sarue their purpose against y^
clergy. But yet because they have a far farther purpose against all good
cryste^ faith: they be not content therefore to leave at his point but step
them forth farther and deny purgatory utterly / to the^de that men should take
boldness to care the less for their sin. And if they might onys be believed
theryn: the^ would they step yet farther and deny hell and all / and after that
heaven to. But as for heaven albeyt y^ as yet they deny yt not: yet pull they
many a simple soul thence / which were yt not for their myscheuous doctrine
were else well lykly to be there a full bright and gloryouse saint.

And surely the more that wise men advise them self upon this matter: the more
shall they marvel of the mad mind of them that deny purgatory / or say y^
the prayours or good workys of me^ living in the world ca^ do us here no good.
For every man that any wit has: wotteth well that the surest way were in every
dowt best to be taken Now suppose then that purgatory could in no wise be
prouyd / and y^ some would yet say plainly y^ there were one / and some would say
plainly nay^let us now see whether sort of these twain might take most harm /
if their part were the wrong. Furst he that believed there were purgatory / and
that his prayour and good wurkes wrought for his (...) dys soul might relyeue
the^ theyrn / and because thereof used much prayour and almoyse for them: he
could not lose the reward of his good will / all though his opinion were untrue
/ and that there were no purgatory at all / no more then he leseth his labor
new y^ prays for one who^ he fereth to ly in purgatory where he is all ready
in heaven. But on the the other side / he that believes there is none / and
therefore prays for none: if his opynyo^ be false / and that there be
purgatory in deed as in deed there is / he leseth much good and gets him
also myche harm / for he both fereth myche y^ less to sin and to ly long in
purgatory / saving that his heresye shall save him thense and send him down
deep in to hell.

And yt fares between these two kind of folk as yt fa^ed between a lewd
gala^d and a pore friar. Whom when the galand saw going barefote in a great
froste and snow / he asked him why he did take such pain. And he answered y^
yt was very little pain if a man would remember hell. ye friar quoth y^ galant
but what and there be none hell tha^ art thou a great fool. ye master quoth
the friar but what and there be hell than is your master ship a much more
sole.

More over there was never yet any of that sort / that could for shame say
that any man is in parell for byleuynge that there is purgatory. But they say
only that there is none in deed / and that they may without any sin afferme
their opynro^ for troth. But now upon the the other side many an hundred
thousand / that is to wit all the hole church of christ that is or ever has
been / afferme that the aff^^myng of their opinion against purgatory / is a
plain dampnable heresy. Wherefore it well and plainly appears and every wise
man well sees that yt is the far surer way to belyue in such wise as has
the partys agree to be out of all parell / the^ that way which so far the
greter part and myche farther the better part afferme to be undoubted dedely
sin. And now where as every fool may se that any wise man will take the
sureste way / which is as ye se dowble proved to belyue that there is
purgatory: yet said the wise proctour of beggars y^ wise men will say there is
none. For ^e says y^ many great letterd men and right conynge men / will not
let to put the^ self (...) ^eoperdye of shame and of death also / to show
their mynd^ that there is no purgatory. He is loath to say y^ these be
heretyques but he says these be they that men call heretyques. Wherein he
speaks (...) like as if he word point with his finger to a flokke of fa^
wethers and ^a^ these be such bestys as men call sheep.

(...) now would we feign se which be these wise men and well le^red which
shall not fail upon their own confession to agree that their adversaries
take the sure way and f^rthesie owte of parell and them self the most
daungerouse and ferthest from all surety. But yet would we for y^ while fayn
here who they be. Surely none other but Luther and Tyndale / and this beggars
proctoure / and a few such of that sect / me^ of such vertew / wisdom and
lerning / as their lewd wry^ynge and much more their lewd living shewyth.

But now at they far an other manner sort both in number / wisdom / lernyng
/ truth and good living / which affirm and say the contrary. And surely
if.iii. or iiii. C. good and honest men would faith fully cum forth and tell one
y^ sum of his frend^ were in a far cu^trey for d^t kept in prison / and that
his charity might relyeue them thence: if then.iii. or iiii. fond felows would
cum and say the contrary / and tell him plain there is no such prison at all as
he is borne in hand that his frr^dys at prysoned in: if he would now be so light
to believe those.iii. or.iiii. noughty persons / against those.iii. or.iiii. C.
good and honest me^: he the^ should well decypher him self / and well declare
thereby that he would gladly cach hold of sum small handell to keep his money
fast / rather then help his frendys in their necessyte.

Now if ye consider how late this lewd sect began / which among cryste^ men
barketh against purgatory / and how few always for very shame of their folly has
hitherto fallen in to them: and then if ye consider on the the other side how full
and hole the great corpse of all cryste^ countries so many hundred yerys / have
ever told you the contrary: ye shall we be very sure for every person spekyng
against purgatory / find for the the other part mo than many an hundred.

Now if these men will peradventure say that they care no for such co^paryson /
neither of time with time / number with number / nor cu^pany with cu^pany / but
sith sum one man is in crede^ce worth sum. vu. score: if they will therefore
call us to sum other rekening and will that we compare of the best choice on
both sides a certain / and match them man for man: then have we (if we might
for shame match such blyssed saints with a sort so far unlike) saint
Austayn against friar Luther / saint Hyerom against friar Lambert / saint
Ambrose against friar Husken / saint Gregory against preeste Pomeran / saint
Chrisosteme against Tindale / saint Basyle against y^ beggars proctour.

Now if our enmyes will for lak of other choice / help forth their own perte
with their wyuys: the^ have they some advantage in deed / for y^ the other holy
saints had none. But yet shall we not lack blessed holy women against these
frerys wy^^s. For we shall have saint Anastace against friar Luthers wife /
saint Hildegardes against friar Huskyns wife / saint Brygyte against friar
La^bert^ wife and saint Katheryn of senys against pressed Pomeranys wife. Now if
they will have in these matches y^ qualityes of either side co^syderyd: the^
have we wysdo^ against folly / cu^nyng against ignorance / charity against
malice / true faith against heresies / humilite against arrogau^ce /
reuelacyo^s against illusyo^s / inspyracyo^ of god against mue^cyons of y^
devil / co^staunce against waueryng / abstynence against glotony / co^tyne^ce
against lechery / and finally every kind of virtue against every kind of
vice. And over this where as we be not yet very sure whyther y^ all these
nawghty persons whom we have rehearsed you of y^ worse side / be fully fall so
mad as vterly to deny purgatory / saving in y^ we se them in many things
all of one sect: yet if there were of them far many such mo / they shall
not yet find of y^ simple suit half so many / as for our perte remains holy
blessed saints to match them. For like wise as many their holy workys
eruditely wryte^ and by the help of y^ holy ghost endyghted: euydentely
declare y^ not only saint Austayne / saint Hierome / saint Ambrose and y^ holy
pope saint Gregory / with saint Chrisoste^ / and saint Basyle before remembered /
and those holy women also y^ we have spoken of / but over y^ the great sole^pne
doctor Oregene / all y^ three great doctors and holy sayntys of one name in
greece / Gregorius Nasianzenus / Gregorius Nissenus / Gregorius Emissenus /
saint Cyryllus / saint Damascene / y^ famous doctor and holy martyr saint
Cipryane / saint Hylory / saint Bid / and saint Thomas / and finally all such
as are of y^ suyt and sort either greeks or latyns / have ever taught and
restyfyed and exhorted y^ people to pray for all crystyn soulys and preched for
purgatory: so does there no man dowte but y^ all good and deuowte cryste^ people
from crystys days hitherto / has ferme and fast been of y^ same bylyefe /
and with thyr daily prayours and almoyse deed done for us have done us great
relyefe. So that as we said both for number of many folk and goodness of
chosen folk: our enemies are far under us. And yet have we for the vauntage
as we have before declared you y^ fere of Ezechyas / the book of the kyngys /
the words of the prophet zachary the faith of Machabeus y^ authoryte of saint
Iha^n / the wordys of saint Peter the sentence of saint Poule / y^ testimony of
saint Matthew and the plain sentence of our savior christ.

Now if these heretyques be so styffe and stoborne / that rather then they will
confess them self concluded / they will hold on their old ways and fall
from wurse to wurse / and like as they have allredy against their formar
promise first rejected reason and after law / and then all y^ doctors and
old holy fathers of crystys church / and finally the hole church yt self:
so if they will at length as we greatly fere they will reject all scripture and
cast of Criste and all: now as we say if they so do yet have we left at the
wurst way Luther against Luther Huskyn against Huskyn / Tyndall against Tyndall
and finally every heretyke against him self. And the^ when these folk sit in
Almayn upon their bear bench in judgment on us and our matters: we may as the
knight of king Alexander appelyd from Alexander to Alexander from Alexander the
dronk to Alexander the sober: so shall we appele from Luther to Luther / from
Luther the dronken to Luther the sober / from Luther the heretyke to Luther the
catholyke / and likewise in all the remenaunt. For this does no man dout but
that every one of the^ all / before they fell dronk of the dreggys of old
poysonyd heresies / in which they fell a quaftyng with the dyuell: they did
full sadly and soberly pray for all christian soulys. But synnys that they be
fallen dronken in wrechyd and sinful heresies: they neither care for other
mennys soulys nor for their own neither. And on the the other side if ever they
wurk with grace to purge them self of those poisoned heresies / wherwyth they
be now so dronk / they will than give sentence on our side as they did before.
It were not yuell y^ we showed you su^what for exsample whereby ye may se what
sobernes they were in before / and in what dronkennes the dyuels drawghte has
brought them. And in whom should we show yt better than in Luther him self
archeheretyke and father abbot of all that dronke^ felishype Furst this man was
so fast of our side while he was well and sober / that yet when he began to be
well washed / he could not find in his heart utterly to fall from us. But when
his head furste began to dase of that evil drink: he wrote that purgatory coud
not prouyd by scripture. And yet that not wythstandyng he wrote in this wise
therwyth. I am very sure that there is purgatory / and yt little moves me what
heretykis babble. Should I believe an heretyke borne of late sca^t fysty yerys ago
/ and say the faith were false that has been holden so many hundred year? Lo
here this man spoke well upon our side. But yet said he therewith one thing or
twain / that coud not stand therwyth: and thereby may ye se that he began to
reele. For he both affyrmyd that purgatory coud not be prouyd by scripture /
and affyrmyd ferther that nothing coud be taken for a sure and certain truth /
but if yt appeared by clear and euydent scripture. Which two thyngys
presupposed: how coud any man be sure of purgatory? But the help is that both
those poynt^ be false. For both is purgatory prouyd by scripture / and the
chatholyke faith of Crystys church were suffyeyent to make men sure thereof /
albe yt there were not in all scripture one text for yt / and diverse y^ semyd
against it as we have showed you before.

But here as we say ye se how shamfully he staggared and began to reele: how
be it sone after being so dowsy dro^k y^ he could neither stand nor reele but
fell down sow dronk in the mire: then like one y^ nothing remembered what he
had said / nor herd not his awn voice / he began to be him felf y^ babelynge
heretic against who^ he had wryte^ before: and being not fully fyfty year old
/ began to gaynsay y^ faith of almost.xv. hundred year before his days in the
church of Criste / be sydys.xv. C. year three tymys told among other faithful
folk before. For now in his dronken sermon that he wrote upon the gospel of
y^ rich man and Lazare / where as he had in his other bokys before framyd of
his own fantasy / new fond fassyons of purgatory / and told them forth for as
plain matters as though he had been here and seen them: now in this mad sermon
of his he says plainly that there is none at all / but that all soulysly still
and sleep / and so sleep shall / un till the day of dome. O sow dronken soul
drownyd in such an insensyble sleep that he lies and rowghteth / while the
apostles / the eua^ gelystys / all the doctors of Crystes church / all the
hole christian people / and among them christ him self / stand and cry at his
ere / that we sely christian sowlys lie and burn in purgatory / and he can not
here but lies still in the mire and snorteth and there dremeth that we lie
still and sleep as he does.

And thus where the beggars proctour writes that wise me^ say there is no
purgatory: ye se now your self how wise is he whom they take for the wyseste
of all that sort / as him that is now y^ very well spryng and archeherytyque of
all their sect. Of all which wise men we leave yt to your wisdom to
consider: whyther ye find any whom your wysedomes would in wysedom compare with
any of those old holy doctors and sayntys whom we have rehearsed you before.
But this man we wot well for a another of these wise me^ means Wyllyam
Tyndall. Whose wysedom well appears in y^ matter by y^ he lays against yt
nothing but skoffynge: wheryn he says that y^ pope may be bold in purgatory /
because yt is he says a thing of his own making: where as we have proved you
by scripture that purgatory was perceived and taught and deed mennys soulys
prayed for / so long ere ever any pope bygan.

But for as myche as he says that wise men will say there is no purgatory /
among which wise men we dowte not but the wise man accompteth him self ^ for
he lays for that part as him self weneth very wise and weyghty resons / y^
wysdo^ whereof we have all ready prouyd you very plain frantyke folly) we will
now finyshe the dyspycyons of all this debate and questyon / with y^
declaracyon of one or two poyntys of his especyall wisdom / and with one of
which him self wisely destroys all his holy matter.

Furste ye se well that albe yt in deed he entendeth to go ferther if his byll
were ones well sp^dde: yet he pretendyth nothing in vysage but only the spoil
/ wedding / and beatynge of the clergy: to whom he layth not all only such
fautys as ye have hard / and has prouyd his purpose with such groundys as we
have prouyd false: but also layth one great necessyte to take all from the^ /
because they break y^ statute made of mortmayn / and purchase more landys still
against y^ prouysyon thereof. And the^ says he y^ any land which onys cu^meth
in their handys / cu^myth never ont again. For he says y^ they have such laws
concerning their lands / as they may neither give any nor sell. For which
cause lest they should at length have all / he deuyseth to let them have nothing.

Now furst where he makes as though there ca^ yet for all the statute daily
much land in to the^ / and y^ there can none at all come from the^: neither is
the tone so much as he would make yt seem / and the the other is very false. For
truly there may cu^ and does cu^ sa^d fro the^ by eschete / as we be sure many
of you have had experyence: and also what laws so ever they have of their own
y^ prohibyte the^ to sell their landys / yet of this are we very sure y^ not
wythstandyng all y^ laws they have / they may sell in such wise if they will
all the land they have / y^ they ca^ never recover foot again. And besidys all
y^ albe it there be laws made by the church against such salys as shrewd
husband^ would else boldly make of y^ la^d^ of their monestaryes: yet is there
not so p^cyse prouysyon made against all salys of their lands / but y^ they
may be alienyd for cause reasonable approuid by y^ advise and counsel of their
chief head. And many a man is there in y^ realm y^ has lands given or sold out
of abbays and out of byshoppriches both: so y^ this perte is a plain lie

The the other part is also neither very certain nor very much to purpose. For
truly though that in the cytee of London to which there is grauntyd by
authoryte of parliament / that men may there deuyse their landys in to
mortemayn by their testamentes / there is sumwhat among given into the church /
and yet not all to them but the great perte unto the cumpanyes and felyshyppys
of the craftys: in another placys of the realm there is now a days no great
thing given / but if yt be sometime some small thing for the foundacyon of a
chauntery. For as for abbays or such other great fou^dacyo^s there be not now a
days many made nor have been of good while / except somewhat done in the
vnyuersytees. And yet who so consider those great foundacyons that have this
great while been made any where / shall well parceyue that the substance of
the^ be not all fownden upon temporal landys new token owte of the temporal
handys in to the church / but of such as the church had long a fore / and
now the same translated from one place unto a another: And over this shall he
find that many an abbey (whose hole living this man weneth stood all by
te^porall landys given them in their foundacyon) have the great part thereof
in be^efycys given in and empropred unto them. So that if he consider the
substance of all the great fou^dacyons made this great while / and all that
has in to any such these many days be given / and then consider well
therwyth how cold the charity of cryste^ people waxes by the meanys of such
deuyls proctours as under pretexte of beggynge for the pore / entend and labor
to quench the fervor of deuocyo^ to godwarde in simple and sone led sowlys:
he shall not need to fere that all the te^porall land in the realm shall come
in to the spyrytualtye. And yet if men went now so fast to give in still to
the church as they did before while devotion was serue^t in the people and
virtue plentuouse in the church: yet might yt be and in other cuntrees is
provided for well enough / both that me^nys devotion might be be favored / and
yet not the church have all.

But this wise man lest they should have all: would leave them right naught.
For his wysedom weneth there were no mean way between every whyt and never a
whyt but nothing at all. And surely where that he lays so sore unto them /
the new purchasing of more temporal landys either bought or given them: yt
appears well he would say sore to them if they pulled the land fro men by
force / which now lays so hyghly to their charge because they take yt when
men give yt them: which thing we suppose him self as holy as he is / would
not myche refuse. Nor they be not myche to be blamed if they receive mennys
devotion / but if they bestow yt not well. And yet where he says there can no
statute hold them / but they purcha^e still and break the statute / where in
he would seem co^nynge because he had a little smatterynge in the law: yt were
good ere he be so bold to put his ignorance in writing / that he should se
the statute better. Which when he list to look upon again and let some
wyser man look with him / if he consider well what remedy the statutes provide
and for whom: he shall find yt the makers of the statute not so much fered the
great high point that prykketh him now lest the hole temporal landys should
come in to the church / as they did the loss of their wardys and their
vnlykelyhed of eschetes and sum other co^moditees yt they lakked when their
la^d^ were alyened in to the church: and yet not in to the church only but
also in to any mort mayn. And for this they provided y^ if any more were
alyened in to ye church or in to any manner of morte main / the king or any
other lord medyate or immedyate that might take loss thereby might enter there
in to / to thente^t y^ ere ever the purchase were made / they should be fayn in
such wise to sue to every one of the^ for his lyce^ce and good will / that each
of them should be arbyte^ of his own hurt or loss and take his amendys at his
own hand. And this statute is not made only for y^ advantage of the te^porall
lordys against the clergy / but yt is made indyfferently against all mortmayn:
which is as well te^porall folk as spyrytuall / and for the benefyte as well of
spyrituall men as temporal. For as well shall a bishop or an abbot have the
advantage of that statute if his tenant alyen his landys in to any mortemayn
/ as shall an earl or a duke* And now when the church pulls not away y^ land
from the owner by force / but has yt of his devotion and his gift given of his
own offer unasked / and yet not without lyce^ce of all such as the statute
lymyteth: where is this great faut of theyrs / for which lest they should take
more in y^ same manner / he would they should lose all that they have all ready?
What wisdom is this when he layth against them their deed wherein they break no
law? And yet sith they can not take yt without the king and the lordys / his
wordys if they wayd ought / should ro^ne to the reproach and blame of them whom
he would fayn flater / without faut founden in them whom he so sore accuses.
But now the special high point of his wisdom for which we be driven to speak
of this matter he specially declares in this. Ye se well that he would that the
temporal me^ should take fro the clergy / not only all these landys purchased
synnys the statute of mortemayn / but also all that ever they had before too /
and yet over this all the hole living y^ ever they have by any manner mean
beside: because he thinks that they have to much by all to gether. And when
he has given his advise thereto and said that they have to much: then says he
by and by that if there were any purgatory in deed / yt were well done to give
them yet more / and that they have then a great deal to little. But now so is yt
that purgatory there is in deed / nor no good christian man is there but he will
and must believe and confess the same. whereof yt plainly folowyth that his own
agreement added unto the troth / that is to say that the church has as he
says to little if there be a purgatory / added unto the troth that there is a
purgatory / and that every true christian man does and must confess yt: then
has loo the wise man brought all his purpose so substancyally to pass / that
by his own plain agreement added unto the vndoutable troth / no man may do
that he would have all men do / spoil and pyll the church / but he that will
furste plainly profess him self a plain and undo wtyd heretyke.

And therefore sith ye now se the wit of this wise man / yt laboreth to bring us
owte of your remembrance / sith ye se the simple ground of his proud
supplycacyon / and ye perceive the rancour and malice that his matter stands
on: for fulfyllyng whereof he would by his will bring all the world in trouble:
and sith ye se that he hates ye clergy for the faith / and us for the clergy
/ and in reprouyng purgatory proves him self an infydele: sith we have made
yt you clear that your prayour may do us good / and have showed yt you so
plainly that a child may perceive yt / not only by the comen opinion of all
people and the fast vnfallyble faith of all christian people from Crystys days
until your own time / confermed by the doctrine of all holy doctors /
declared by good reason / and proved by the scripture of god / both apostles /
and euangelystys / and our savior Christ him self: we will encumber you no
ferther with dysputyng upon the matter / nor argue the thing as dowtefull /
that is undoubted and questyonlesse. But lettyng pass over such heretics as
are our malycyouse mortal enemies / prayenge god of his, grace to give them
better mind: we shall turn us to you that are faithful folk and our dear
loving fre^dys / besechyng your goodness of your tender pity that we may be
remembered with your cherytable almoyse and prayour. And in this part albe yt
we stand in such case that yt better bycummeth us to beseech and pray every
man / then to find any fawte with any man: yet are we somewhat constrained not
to make any matter of quarrel or co^playnt against any ma^nys vnkidenes / but
surely to mourn and lament our own hard fortune and chance in ye lakke of
relyefe and cu^forte / which we miss from our fre^dis / not of evil mind
wythdrawe^ us / or of unfaithfulness / but of neglyge^s forslouthed and foded
forth of forgetfulness. If ye yt ar such (for ye be not all such) might look
upon us and byhold in what heavy plyght we ly: your sloth would sone be
quikened and your oblyuion turn to fresh remembrance.

For if your father / your mother / your child / your brother / your
suster, your husband / your wife / or a very stranger to / lay in your
syghte some where in fire / and that your means might help him: what heart
were so hard / what stomach were so stony / that could sit in rest at supper
or sleep in rest a bed / and let a manly and burn* We find therefore full
true that old said saw / owte of sight owte of mind. And yet surely to say
the truth / we can not theryn with reason much complain upon you. For while
we were with you there, for wantonness of that wreched world we forgate in like
wise our good frendys here. And therefore can we not maruayle myche though the
justice of god suffer us to be forgoten of you as other have been before
forgoten of us. But we beseech our lord for both our sakys to give you the
grace to mend for your part that comen faut of us both / lest when ye cum
hither here after / god of like (...) suffer you to be forgoten of them that ye
leave there behind you / as ye forgete us that are come hither before you But
albe yt we can not well as we say for the like faut in our self greatly rebuke
or blame this negligence and forgetfulness in you: yet would we for the better
wysh you that ye might wythowt your pain / onys at the least wise behold /
parceyue / and se / what heaviness of heart and what a sorrowful shame the sely
soul has at his furst coming hither to look his old frendys in the face here
/ whom he reme^ bryth him self to have so foul forgoten while he lived there.
When albe yt that in this place no man ca^ be angry / yet their pytuouse look
and lamentable countenance casts his unkind forgetfulness in to his mind:
wit ye well dear friends that among the manyfold great and greuouse pain
which he suffers here / whereof god send you y^ grace to suffer either none or
few: the grudge and grief of his cons^yence in the consyderacyon of his
unkind forgetfulness / is not of all them the least. Therefore dear frendys let
our folly learn you wisdom. Send hither your prayour: send hither your almoyse
before you: so shall we find ea^e thereof / and yet shall ye find yt still.
For as he that lyghtyth another the ca^dell has never the less light him self
/ and he that blowyth y^ fire for another to warm him does warm him self also
there with: so surely good frendys the good that ye send hither before you /
both greatly refreshes us / and yet is holly reseruyd here for you with our
prayours added thereto for your ferther advantage.

Would god we coud have done our self as we now counsel you. And god give you
y^ grace which many of us refused / to make better prouysyon while ye live tha^
many of us have done. For mich have we left in our executours hand^ / which
would god we had bestowed upon pore folk for our own soulys and our fre^dys
with our own handys. Much have many of us bestowyd upon rych me^ in gold
rings and blak gownys: much in many tapers and torchys: much in worldly pomp
and high solemn ceremonies about our funerallys / whereof the brotle glory
stands us here god wot in very little stead / but has on the the other side done
us great dyspleasure. For albe yt yt the kind solycytude and loving dylygence
of the quyk used about the beryeng of the deed / is well allowed and approuyd
before the face of god: yet much superfluouse charge used for boste and
oste^tacyon / namely devised by the deed before his death / is of god greatly
myslyked: and most especially that kind and fassyon thereof wherein some of us
have fallen / and many besydys us that now lie damnyd in hell. for some has
there of us while we were in health / not so much studied how we might dye
penyte^t and in good christian plyght / as how we might be solempnely borne owte
to beryeng / have gay and goodly funerallys with herawdys at our hersys / and
ofrynge up our helmettys / setting up our skouchyn and cote armours on the
wall though there never came harneyse on our bakkys / nor never auncestour of
ours ever bare armis before. The^ devised we some doctor to make a sermon at
our mass in our monthys mind / and there preche to our praise with some fond
fantesy devised of our name / and after mass / much festyng ryotouse and
costly / and finally like mad men made men merry at our death / and take our
beryeng for a brydeale. For special punyshement whereof / some of us have been
by our evil (...) brought forth full heuely in full great despyght to be hold
our own beryeng / and so standen in great pain inaysyble among the (...) /
and made to look on our cateyn corpse carried owte with great pope / whereof our
lord knows we have taken heavy pleasure.

Yet would ye peradventure wene that we were in one thing well eased / in that
we were for the time taken hense out of the fire of our purgatory. But in this
point if ye so think / ye be sarre deceived. For like wise as good angels and
saved soulys in heaven / never lose nor lessen their joy by chaungyng of their
placys / but though there be any special place appointed for heaven ferthest
from the center of the hole world or where so ever yt be / be yt bodyly or
above all bodyly space / the blessed heavenly spyrytys where so ever they bycu^
be either still in heaven or in their heavenly joy: nor Gabryell when he comdown
to our lady / never forbear any part of his pleasure / but he had yt
peradventure with some new degree encreaced by the cu^forte of his joyful
message / but mynysshed might yt never be / not and he had an erand in to hell;
right so fares it on y^ the other side / that neither dampened wreches at any time
/ nor we for the space of our clensynge time though we have for the generaltye
our comen place of pain appointed us here in purgatory: yet if it please our
lord that at any season our gardayns convey some of us to be for some
consyderacyons any time else where / as some percase to appear to some fre^d
of ours and show him how we stand / and by y^ sufferau^s of goddys souerayn
goodness to tell him with what almoyse / prayour / pilgrimage / or other good
deed done for us he may help us hense / in which thing the devil is loath to
walk with us but he may not chese and can no ferther wythstand us the^ god
will give him leave / but whyther so ever he carry us we carry our pain with us:
and like as the body that has an hot fever as ferue^tly burns if he ride an
horsbake as if he lay lapped in his bed: so carry we still about no less hete
with us / the^ if we lay bounden he^e. And yet the dysp yghtfull syghtys that
our evil aungellis bring us to behold abroad / so far augme^teth
ourturment: that we would wyshe to be drowned in the darkness that is here /
rather than se the syghtys that they show us there.

For among they convey us in to our own housys / and there dowble is our pain
with sight sometime of y^ self same thyngys which while we lived was half our
heaven to behold. There show they us our substance and our baggys stuffed with
gold: which when we now se / we set myche less by them then would an old man
that found a bag of chery stonys which he laid up when he was a child. What a
sorrow has it be^ to some of us when y^ devils has in dispyghtfull mokkage /
cast in our teeth our old love borne to our money / and the^ showed us our
executours as bysyly ryfling a ra^sakyng our housys / as though they were men of
war that had taken a town by force.

How heuely has yt think you gone unto our heart / when our evil au^gellys
have grynned and lawghed and showed us our late wyuys so sone wa^en wanton /
and forgetyng us their old^ husbandys that have loved them so tendrely and
left them so rich / sytte and lawgh and make merry and more to sumtyme / with
their new woars / while our kepers in dyspyte keep us there in pain to stand
still / and look on. Many times would we then speak if we could be suffered /
and sore we long to say to her: Ah wife wife y wysse this was not covenant
wife / when ye wept and told me that if I left you to live by / ye would
never wedde again. We se there our children to / who^ we loved so well / pype
sing and dawnce / and no more think on their fathers soulys then on their
old shone: saving that sometime cu^meth out god have mercy on all christian
sowlys. But yt cu^meth out so coldely and with so dull affection / that yt
lies but in the lyppys and never came nere the heart. Yet here we sometime our
wyuis pray for us more warmely. For in chiding with her secunde husband to
spyghte him with all / god have mercy says she on my first husbands soul /
for he was ywysse an honest man far unlike you. And then marvel we myche
when we here them say so well by us. For they were ever wont to tell us
otherwise.

But when we find in this wise our wiuys / or children and fre^dys / so sone
and so clearly forgete us / and se our executours rap and rend unto them self
/ catch every man what he can and hold fast that he catches and care
nothing for us: lord god what yt greueth us that we left so much bihynd us /
and had not sent hither more of our substance before us by our own handys.
For happy find we him among us / y^ sends before all y^ may be forborne. And
he that is so loath to part with aught / that hordeth up his good and had as
live dye almost as to break his hepe / and then at last when there is none
other remedy but that he must nedys leave yt / repents him self suddenly and
lakketh time to dyspose yt / and therefore byddeth his frendys to bestow yt well
for him: our lord is yet so marcyfull yt of his goodness he acceptyd y^ good
dedys y^ his executours do in performyng his deuyce. And sith that late is
better the^ never: our lord somewhat allows the mannys mind / by which he
would his goodys that he has immoderately gathered and gredily kept together
as long as he might / were yet at the least wise well bestowed at last when
he must nedys go fro the^. Which mind yet more pleases god / the^ that a man
cared not what were done with them. And therefore as we say the goodness of god
somewhat does accept yt. But yet surely sith we might and ought to have done
yt our self / and of a fylthy affection toward our goodys could not find in
our heart to part from any part of the^ / if our executours now deceive us and
do no more for us then we did for our self: our lord did us no wrong though
he never gave us thank of all our hole testament / but imputed the frustracyon
and not performynge of our last will unto our own fawte: sith the delay of
our good dedys dreuen of to our death / grew but of our own slewth and
flesshely love to the worldward / with faintness of devotion to god ward /
and of little respect and regard unto our own soul. And over this if our
executours do these good thyngys indede that we do thus at last deuyse in out
testament: yet our defawte dryuynge all to our death as we told you before /
though god as we said of his high goodness leueth not all unrewarded / yet this
warning will we give you / that ye deceive not your self: we that have so
dyed have thus found yt / that the goodys disposed after us / get our
executours great thank / and be toward us ward accounted before god myche less
then half our awn / nor our thank nothing like to that yt would have been if
we had in our health given half as much for goddys sake with our own handys. Of
which we give you this frendely warnyng not for that we would dyscorage you to
dyspose well your goodys when ye dye: but for that we would advise you to
dyspose then better while ye live.

And among all your almoyse / sumwhat remember us: Our wyuys there remember
here your husbandys. Our children there remember here your parentys. Our
parentys there remember here your children. Our husba^dys there remember here
your wyuys. Ah sweet husbandys while we lived there in that wreched world with
you / while ye were glad to please us: y^ bestowed much upon us and put your
self to great cost and did us great harm therwyth? With gay ^ow^ys and gay
kyrtels and much waste in apparel rings and (...) / with (...) and pasti^
garneshed with perl^ / with which proud pykynge up: both ye took hurt and we
to / many mo ways (...) though we told you not so than. But two thyngys were
the^e special of which your self felt then that ^on^ and we feel now the
^other. For ye had us the (...) and the more stoburn to you: and god ^ad us in
less favor: and that alak we l^i^. For now that gay gere burns upon our
^akkys: and those proud p^rled pest^s hang (...) about our (...)* those
par^e^ettye and those ow^^^ hang heavy about our nekkes and cleue fast fire hot
/ that woe be we there and wyshe that while we lived ye never had followed our
(...) nor never (...) us nor made us so wanton / nor had given us other (...)
than ymons or great garlyk heddys / nor other perles for our (...) and our
pastrys then far orient peason. But now for as much as that (...) and cannot
be called again: we beseech you sith (...) us have them (...) let them hurt none
other woman but help to do us good: sell them for our saky^ to (...) and (...)
the money ^ether by mass pennys and by pore men that may (...) for our (...).

Our fathers (...) while we lived fostred us up so te^derly (...) ^ndured to se
us suffer pain: now open your hertes and (...) at the least wise with a pore
mannis (...) a^mes* ye (...) not when we were with you have let to lay out
myche money for a great marriage. which if ye me^t for our sakes and not for
your own worldly worship / give us now sum perte thereof and releue us here with
much less cost then one marriage / and more pleasure then.xv. though every one
were a prince or a pryncesse of a realm.

Finally all our other frendys and every good christian man and woman open your
hartys and have sum pity upon us. If ye believe not yt we need your help / alas
the lak of faith. If ye believe our need and care not for us / alas the lak of
pity. For who so pytyeth not us / whom ca^ he pity? If ye pity the pore / there
is none so pore as we / yt have not a bra^te to put on our ^akkys. If ye pity
the blind / there is none so blind as we which ar here in the dark saving for
syghtis vnplesau^t and lothesum till sum cu^fort cum. If ye pity the same /
there is none so lame as we / that nether ca^ crepe one foot out of the fire /
nor have one hand at lyberte to defend our face fro the flame. Finally if ye
pity any man in pain / never knew ye pain comparable to ours: whose fire as
far passes in hete all the firys that ever burned upon earth / as the
hostest of all those passes a ^eynyd fire payntyd on a wall. If ever ye lay
syk and thought the night song / and longed sore for day while every hour
seemed longer than five: bethynk you then what a long night we sely soulys
endure / that ly slepelesse / restless / burning / and broylyng in the dark
fire one long might of many days / of many wekys / and sum of many years to
gether. You walter peradventure and toster in syknes fro side to side and find
little rest in any part of the bed: we ly bounde^ to the brondys and cannot
lift up our heddys. You have your physycyo^s with you that sumtyme cure and
hele you: no phisyk will help our pain / nor no plaster cole our hete. Your
kepars do you great ease and put you in good cu^fort: our kepars at such as god
keep you from / cruel damned spyry^^ odyouse / enuyouse / and hateful /
dyspytuouse e^mys and dyspytefull turmentours / and their cu^pany more horrible
and grievous to us then is the pain yt self and thintollerable turment that they
do us wherwyth from top to too they ceace not contynually to tere us.

But now if our other enmys these heretikys almost as cruel as they /
procuryng to their power that we should be lo^^ left in y^ dyuels handys will
as their usage is to rail instead of resonyng / make a game and a^esie now of
our heavy pain / and peradventure laugh at our lame^tacyon / because we speak of
our hedd^ / our handys / our feel / and such our other gross bodyly members
as lie beryed in our grauis and of our garmentys that we did were which come
not hither with us: we bysech you for our dear ladies love to let their folly
go by / and to consider in your own wysdom that yt were impossyble to make any
mortal man living perceive what manner pain and in what manner wise we bodylesse
soulys do suffer and sustain: or to make any man upon earth perfytely to
conceive in his ymagynacyon and fantasy / what manner of substance we be: much
more impossyble then to make a borne blind man to perceive in his mind the
nature and dyffere^ce of colors. And therefore except we should of our painful
(...) tell you nothing at all (and there would they have yt we must of
necessyte use you such wordys as your self understand / and use you the
symylytudes of such thyngys as your self is in ure with. For sith neither god /
angel nor soul / is in such wise blind / dome / defe / or lame / as be those
me^ yt for lak of eyes / legs / hands / tongue / or ere / be weke and
impotent in y^ powers yt proceed from them: but have in the^ self a far more
excellent sight / heryng / delyuernesse / and spech / by meanys vncognable to
man / then any man can have living there on yerth: therefore does holy scripture
in spekyng of such things / use to r^^sent the^ to y^ people by y^ namys of
such powers instruments / and members / as men in such thyngys use and
occupye the^ self. Which manner of speaking in such cas^ who so ever have in
derysyon: declares very well how little faith he has in Crystys own words /
in whychy our savior him self spekyng of the sowlys of the rich gloton and
pore nedy Lazarus and of the Patriarch Abraam also speaks in like manner as we
do / of finger and tongue to^ whereof they had neither another there. And therefore
who so makes a mok at our words in this point: ye may sone se what credence
ye should give him / wheryn we be content ye give him even as much as ye se your
self that he gives to god: for more ye ought not and surely less ye can not.
For he gives god not a whyt: but takes in his heart that story told by god
for a very fantastyke fable.

And therefore as we say passing over such ^estyng and raylyng of those
vncherytable heretykys mortal enymyes unto us and to then self both: consider
you our paynys / and pity the^ in your hartys / and help us with your prayours
/ pylarymagys and other almoyse dedy^: and of all thing in special procure us
the suff^a^^s and blessed obla^yon of the holy mass whereof no man living so
well can tell the fruit as we that here feel yt.

The cu^forte that we have here except our continual hope in our lord god
cummeth at seasons from our Lady / with such gloryouse sayntys as either our
self with our own deuocyo^ while we lived / or ye with yours for us synnys our
decease and departing have made intercessours for us. And among other right
especyally be we beholden to the blessed spyrytys our own proper good angels /
Who^ when w^ behold cu^myng with cu^fort to us / albe yt that we take great
pleasure and (...) theryn: yet is yt not without much confusyon and (...) to
consider how little we regardyd our good angels and how se* d^ we thought upon
the^ while we lived. They (...) up our prayers to god and good saints for us:
and they bring down fro the^ the cu^fort and consolacyon to us. With which when
they cum and cu^fort us: only god and we know what joy yt is to our hartys and
how heartily we pray for you. And therefore if god accept the prayour after his
own favor born toward him that prays and thaffeccyon that he prays with:
our prayer must nedys be profitable / for we stand sure of his grace. And our
prayer is for you so fervent / that ye can no where find any such affection
upon earth. And therefore sith we (...) so sore in paynys and have in our great
necessyte so great need of your help and y^ ye may so well do yt / whereby shall
also rebownd upon your self an inestymable profit: let never any slothful
oblyuyon race us out of your remembrance / or malicyouse enmy of ours cause
you to be careless of us / or any gredy mind upon your good withdraw your
gracious alms from us. Thynk how sone ye shall cu^ hither to us: thynk what
great grefe and rebuke would then your unkindness be to you: what cu^fort on the
contrary part when all we shall thank you: what help ye shall have here of your
good sent hither. Remember what kyn ye and we be to gether: what familier
fre^dsyp has ere this been between us: what sweet wordys ye have spoken and
what promise ye have made us. Let now your wordis appear and your fair promise
be kept. Now dear frendys remember how nature and crystendom byndeth you to
remember us. If any point of your old favor / any piece of your old love / any
kindness of kindred / any c^re of acquayntance / any favor of old frendshyp /
any spark of charity / any tender point of pity / any regard of nature / any
respect of crystendu^ / be left in your brestys: let never the malice of a few
fond fellows a few pestylent persons born toward presthod / relygyon / and your
christian faith: race out of your hartys the care of your kynred / all force of
your old frendys / and all remembrance of all christian soulys. Remember our
thurst while ye sit and drynk: out honger while ye be festing: our restless
wach while ye be slepyng: our sore and greuouse pain while ye be playng: our
hot burning fire while ye be in pleasure and sportyng: so mote god make yourof
spring after remember you: so god keep you hens or not long here: but bring
you shortly to that bliss / to which for our lordys love help you to bring
us / and we shall set hand to help you thither to us
