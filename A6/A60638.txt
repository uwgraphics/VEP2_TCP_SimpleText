THE PREFACE.
I. THE Design of our Publication of these Cures (being purely matter of Fact)
is Twofold; 1. That such a Cloud of Experiments (so Exactly taken) might not
be lost, by reason of their exceeding Benefit and Use which they may prove of
to Posterity. 2. That all young Physicians and Chirurgians, and other Ingenious
Persons, whether Gentlemen or Ladies who practice Our Art, might have something
from Experience, w^^ch might guide them alittle by the hand (as it were and
lead them through the many Intricacies of Physic and Surgery; well knowing
that nothing is so pleasantly and so firmly taught as that which is done by
Example: for as much as every Exemplification is not only an Illustration in
the Mind, but also a Direction of the Intellect in performing the like again.

II. The Reason of the Manner of the Publication (which will be Sheet by sheet
Weekly) is from a certain Necessity: 1. Because the WORK is like to be very
Great and Voluminous, whereby the time of its Publication would be long, and
the Charge of so great an Undertaking not small. 2. For the present
satisfaction of the Buyer, whereby not only the Value will be in a manner
insensible to him, but also the Expectations and Earnest Desires of many will
be daily answered; Who peradventure might think it long to wait the Printing of
Five or Six hundred Sheets of Paper. This way of Exposing them was by the
Advice of some Physicians and Chirurgians (Well-willers to this Design) as also
by the Opinion of the Book seller, whereby a continual supply will be provided
to the carrying on of this so great a Work, which, were it to be exposed whole,
would scarcely be sold under 4l. a Book. The first sheet will begin Wednesday
the 27th of July 1681, and so come out weekly, Wednesdays and Frydays, till the
sum of all the said Cures are Exposed.

III. Each sheet will treat of a Particular Disease: wherein under every
History you will have for the most part, 1. The Constitution of the Body of the
sick. 2. The Symptoms predominant. 3. The Cause of the Disease, what? 4. The
Exact Method which was taken in the Cure. 5. An Exact Account of the Medicines
Exhibited, with the Order of their Exhibition, Various Doses and Success
thereupon. This Medicinal History will contain above Three Thousand of our Own
Observations, digested each under their proper Heads: wherein also we shall
insert several of the choicest Observations of other Famous Men, such are those
of Crato, Forestus, Skenkius, Rulandus, Platerus, Zacutus, Riverius, Willis,
Hildanus, etc. which are already Printed, and other some which are fallen into
our Hands in Manuscripts, the which by Reason of the Service they may do the
public. We are Unwilling should Perish by the Devouring Jaws of Time, for want
of a seasonable publication.

IV. This Whole Work will be divided into several Books: Which will Treat of
Diseases of the Head: Of Diseases of the Thorax or Breast. Of Diseases of the
Abdomen or Belly. Of Fevers. And of Surgery, relating to Tumors, Wounds,
Ulcers, Fractures, and Dislocations. Wherein Observations of all the principal
Diseases happening to the Bodies of human Kind will be faithfully exposed, with
many other things of Excellent Use: and absolutely necessary to be known by all
the Professors and Practisers of Our Art.

V. Now, because many of these Diseases have been cured not with Ordinary
Medicines of the Shops, but by such as we have peculiarly selected out of a
farraginous heap, it may be reasonable to publish a Catalogue of the same with
their several prizes, for as much as that we shall have them always, or for the
most part, ready prepared by Us. The Catalogue shows you in which of our Books
their Composition Preparation, Virtues, Use and Dose are to be found, viz.
Whether in Our Pharmacopoeia, or Doron which is now in the Press: and if in our
Pharmacopoeia, in what Page and Column. Those marked with this () Character are
principal, and so indeed ought to be look upon, being medicaments of great
Virtue, Power and Use.

Page. Vale.

TO THE MOST SERENE, ILLUSTRIOUS AND POTENT MONARCH, CHARLES II.

BY THE GRACE OF GOD, OF ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, FRANCE, AND IRELAND.

KING, DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, etc.

THE AUTHOR William Salmon ONE OF YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST HUMBLE AND LOYAL SUBJECTS
AND SERVANTS, CONSECRATES THIS ENSUING WORK; AND MOST SVBMISSIVELY, LAYS IT AT
YOUR MAJESTY'S ROYAL FEET.

The PREFACE.
I. WE intend (through the Assistance of the Divine Goodness) to delineate a
complete Medicinal System, wherein we purpose to treat of all Diseases
happening to humane Bodies from Head to Foot, whether internal or external, the
Management of which shall not be only Theorical, or by a method of Precepts,
but also Historical, from a Series of Observations upon the Bodies of sick
People, by help of which, a kind of Demonstration will be made of the Medical
Art, and a Pattern or Platform of Practice laid down to the more juvenile
Professors of these Studies.

II. In this History you have, 1. The Disposition of the Body of the Sick, and
for the most part the Cause of the Disease, what? 2. The Method which was taken
in the Cure, with an exact account of the Medicines exhibited, the order of
their Exhibition, the various Doses, and Success thereupon. In this first
Volume we have inserted several foreign Observations of other famous Men (which
in the following Volumes of this Work will be hereafter omitted) to the end
that by comparing the Practice of the Ancients, with our Modern way of Curing,
the difference may be seen, and to what degree of perfection the Practice of
Physic has arrived in Our Age.

III. And although in this present Book we have not exhibited of our Own Cures
above one hundred and sixty, or thereabouts; yet the whole Medicinal History
(when completed) will contain above Three Thousand of Our own Observations,
all digested under their proper Heads; the which by reason of the Service they
may do the public we are unwilling should perish by the devouring Jaws of
Time, for want of a seasonable Publication.

IV. These Histories or Observations of Cures will not stand alone, but upon a
Rational and Practical Theory, wherein we shall significantly, yet completely
handle every Disease, giving you therein the Names, Definition, Kinds, Signs,
Causes, Prognostics, and Method of Cure, of each Distemper according to the
Modern, and more received ways of Practice; which we hope will be so plain and
perspicuous, that the very reason of the thing will be sufficient to indigitate
(to any intelligent man) the necessity of the Modus Curandi.

V. This whole Work will be divided into several Volumes and Books, in which we
shall Treat in order, 1. Of Diseases of the upper Ventricle or Head. 2. Of
Diseases of the middle Ventricle, or Thorax. 3 Of Diseases of the lower
Ventricle, Abdomen, or Belly. 4. Of Fevers. 5. Of Chyrurgery in Tumors,
Wounds, Ulcers, Fractures and Dislocations. Wherein Observations of all the
principal Diseases happening to the Bodies of humane kind will be faithfully
exposed with many other things of excellent use, and absolutely necessary to be
known by all the Professors and Practisers of Our Art.

VI. The Design of the Publication of these Cures (being purely matter of Fact)
is twofold. 1. That such a Cloud of Experiments (so exactly taken) might not
be lost, by reason of their exceeding Benefit and Use, which they may prove of
to posterity. 2. That all young Physicians, and other ingenious persons,
whether Gentlemen or Ladies, who practice Our Art, might have something from
Experience, which might guide them a little by the hand (as it were) and lead
them through the many Intricacies of Physic and Chyrurgery: well knowing that
nothing is so pleasantly and so firmly taught, as that which is done by
Example; for as much, as every Exemplification, is not only an illustration in
the Mind, but also a Direction to the Intellect in performing the like again.

VII. In the Mean season we cannot but complain to all the Lovers of Art, of a
late scandalous Abuse put upon Me by one Con -- s a Potecary, or Pot-carryer of
Fleet street, who reports up and down the Town, that I am not the Author of the
Books which are published in my name, but that only as an Amanuensis, I wrote
them by the Instruction and Direction of another Gentleman. That person he
pretends to be the Author of them, I confess I know, but my acquaintance with
him is so little, that if all the times I ever were in his Company in my whole
Life were put together, they would not make completely one half day.

VIII. But as I know no Man would be so kind (no not a Father to a Son, much
less a stranger to another Man) to be the Author of so many Books as I have
wrote, and give the honor and reputation of them from himself to another; so,
I as certainly know that the said Potecary or Pot-carryer cannot prove any Man
dead or alive, from whom I have personally or by Letter received any
Instruction or Direction for the Composing or Writing of this or any other of
my Books. And I challenge that Lying and Defaming Tongue to prove the least
Syllable of what he has spoken in that kind, to be Truth.

IX Surely the Man wanted Wit to publish such a silly lying Story, which no
Man, who does not violence to his own Reason and Understanding, can possibly
believe: who can conceive that any Mortal could have so great a kindness for
me, for 9 or 10 years to sit by me and take the pains to Instruct and Direct me
in the Writing of so many great and laborious Books as I have published, and at
length, after the loss of so much time, and so great labor and pains in such
tedious undertakings, be so generous, as to give me not only all the profit of
the Copies, but also the Reputation and Honor of being the Author of the same
too?

X. But, as Detraction could be only the Man's aim; so the lying report is
answerable to its Authors Reputation, both to be believed and trusted alike.
And therefore I think the incredibility of the Story, is as great a Refutation
as any thing I can possibly give, although I here call the Great God to
Witness, that I never personally consulted, or received any Instructions or
Directions from any Man or Men, Living or Dead, in order to the Composing or
Writing, the least part imaginable of any thing I have made public to the
World.

Diseases of the Head. Number. 1. July 27.

CHAP. I. Of the Headache.
I. 1. THE 28 of March, Anno 1664. A poor laboring man, one Jacob Fuller, who
had several years been troubled with an inveterate or old Headache, commonly
called Cephalea, fell into our Hands, after he had, for more than 14 years at
times, bin tampering with many other famous Physicians, to no purpose. 2. The
Constitution of his Body was thin, lean, and spare, so that the sick seemed to
be in an absolute Atrophia, or Consumption, and so we had concluded, but that
his good Appetite, and continued strength of Body, with some other signs, were
good Indications to the contrary; however he was of a cold, dry, and saline
habit of body, and of a very Melancholy and mistrustful mind. 3. The most
predominant Symptoms in the Paroxysm, were vehement pain over the whole head,
but more especially in the hinder part thereof; watchfulness or want of sleep,
with an exceeding wrestlessness accompanying, and a great desire to drink. 4.
The Cause seemed to lie hidden, and indeed had troubled many Wise men to dive
into it; the Stomach seemed well, so that no indication could be taken from
thence: at last in Discourse, I asked him, if he never had some violent blow
upon his Head, chiefly behind? which after a while, recollecting of himself, he
told me, that about 18 years since (for so long this Headache had continued at
fits) he fell down from an high building, and hurt the hinder part of his Head,
so that it did bleed extremely, yet without any Fracture of the Skull. If he at
any time did bleed at Nose, it proved Critical, and he was freed from the pain.
I viewed the place of the Head hurt, and there was a bunching out more than
ordinary, about the bigness of half a Hens Egg, which buching had remained ever
since. I concluded that some matter obstructing remained, which hindered the
direct circulation of the Animal Spirits and Blood. 5. The Indications of Cure,
seemed only to be two, 1. To take away the matter offending or obstructing. 2.
To strenthen the Brain, Animal Spirits, and parts afflicted. 6. In order to the
first intention, I caused the hinder part to be opened, just below the Tumor,
which was done with an actual Cautery, piercing even to the Bone, which the
Chyrurgeon did excellently accomplish, afterward leaving it as an Issue only:
by the Nostrils was exhibited an Errhine, made of the Juyces of Primrose leaves
and Roots, and of Sweet-Marjoram; This was exhibited thrice a week, for about
twelve times. By means of the Issue, the Tumor aforesaid was suddenly abated,
and in a short time wholly taken away, a vast quantity of filthy matter
continually running out thereat; by the Nostrils the Cavities or Ventricles of
the Brain were admirably cleansed, so that the sick became very lightsome, nor
in three weeks time had any return of the Fit, although its usual time of
repetition before, was two or three times a Week. 7. In order to the second
Indication, we caused the Hair to be shaven off from the Occiput, Vertex and
Sinciput, and immediately to be anointed with this Balsam: Take Oil of Spike,
Oil of Limons, Oil of Rosemary, of each twenty drops (all Chymically made,) Oil
of Mace, by expression, two Drams: mix them well together, and anoint
therewith. Inwardly we gave this, Take Powers of Rosemary of Angelica, of
Cloves, of Lavender, of each half an Ounce; mix them: Of this we Ordered 30
drops to be given every morning fasting, and last at Night going to Bed, in two
or three spoonfuls of Sack: His thirst was quenched by a solution of Sal
Prunellae in fair Water and Sugar. This course being pursued the Patient became
well. 8. After ten weeks, the man let his Issue behind dry up, and in about six
weeks after his Head ach came again; he repaired to me, and I caused it to be
opened again, after which he remained well for many years.

II. 1. A young Woman, of about 23 years of Age, had been for 10 years troubled
with a Cephalaea, and no Remedy in all that time could be procured; her parents
made their Application to me. She was of a cold and phlegmatic Constitution,
neither Fat nor Lean, of a white soft and smooth Skin, and had often been
troubled with a quotidian Ague. 2. She had paleness of Countenance, and in the
time of the paroxism, the pain was equally spread over her whole Head; moreover
she had many strumous swellings about her Neck and Throat; nor had she to these
years ever had her Courses. 3. Her youth, strength of body, and cheerfulness
when the fit was off, gave good hopes of Recovery. 4. The Cause was without
doubt Obstructions of the Stomach, Womb and Mesentery; for she often complained
of a great sickness at stomach, and many times refused her Food; as also of a
great heaviness or kind of dull pain, about the middle of her Belly. 5. I
prescribed things gently purging and opening; then I gave her proper Emeticks,
afterward things which purged downwards more powerfully; then about the New of
the Moon, such things as provoked the Terms: Lastly such things as might
strengthen and comfort the Stomach, Womb, and other Bowels. 6. The first thing
I gave her was Pilulae Ruffi, which she took to half a Dram, for 4 Nights going
to bed, drinking the next day about 8 Ounces of Finkius his Steeled Wine, and
some drops of Oil of Sulphur in Ale. The fifth morning following, I gave her a
Dram, of Salt of Vitriol in Broth; this cleansed her stomach admirably, and
brought up much phlegm and filthy matter, whereby she seemed much more cheerful,
this I continued for three times, giving it every other day: upon the eleventh
day, I gave Pilulae ex duobus a Scruple, which I repeated upon the thirteenth
and fifteenth days, giving still upon the intermediate days, the Steeled Wine
of Finkius: This done, upon the sixteenth day, and for eight days following
(which proved to be the New and first quarter of the Moon) I gave her this
following Tincture. Take blood-red Tincture of black Pepper, made in Spirit of
Wine two Ounces, Tincture of Gum Guajaci made in like manner, three Ounces; mix
them together: of this she took morning, noon and night, in a Glass of White or
Rhenish Wine, so much as she could endure well to swallow; this in the time
prescribed, produced her Courses. This done, I caused her for three Months
together to take every morning and night 30 drops of Elixir Proprietatis, made
with tartarized Spirit of Wine, and to drink them in Rhenish or Sack; after
which she became perfectly well.

III. 1. An ancient Woman, who had been for more than 20 years troubled with
this kind of Headache, was cured, as we shall presently relate, although her
Age (for she was above 64 years old) and melancholy habit of body, with the
long continuance thereof, gave many discouragements to the Physician. 2. The
Cause proceeded from cold and viscious humidity, or pituitous matter, lodged in
the Ventricle of the Brain, as a perpetual stoppage of the Head, speaking in
the Nose (as it were) and continual drousiness, gave some Demonstrations of. 3.
She had often taken Purges of all sorts, Vomits, Antimonials, etc, by other
Physicians; they had applied Vesicatories to her Neck and Shoulders, the Seton
to the Nape of the Neck, caused her to have several Issues in her Arms and
other parts, many times sweat her, and given her Diet drinks for 50 or 60 days
together, and all without success, in a word, nothing seemed to be left
unattempted; she drank Mineral waters, and repeated several Courses of Physic,
spring and fall, for many years together; but finding no Remedy, she gave her
self over to despair: she was persuaded by an Eminent Doctor to be Flux't, but
the scandal of the Cure prevented it: another advised her, to open the Skull
(which indeed was good Advice, but a very dangerous way of Cure) this she
refused, because of the Modus Operandi. At last, by the advice of some of her
Acquaintance, she applied her self to me. 4. I enquired as much as I could into
the Cause, and what courses she had proved without success, which she related
to me, as aforesaid. I saw the whole habit of the woman was absolutely
Scorbutic, that she was much and often troubled with Wind, and voided no
Excrements by the Nostrils. These Considerations made me much to doubt the
Cure; but finding the Woman to be of a strong body, to have a good stomach to
her food, and to be very laborious; I was encouraged to attempt it, which I
performed as follows. 5. First I caused for three Nights this Clyster to be
administered. Take Milk or Chicken Broth, twelve Ounces, Oil of Aniseeds, two
Drams, Infusion of Crocus Metalorum, three Ounces; mix, and let it be given
warm: The next morning I gave Confectio Hamech half an Ounce, mixed with
Mercurius Dulcis sixteen Grains; This I repeated three times, every fourth day;
It purged her well and excellently. In the intermediate days of purging, I
cleansed the Head with these solid Errhines. Take Confectio Hamech half an
Ounce, Scammony, Gambogia, fine Aloes, all in fine Powder, of each 2 drams, mix
them well together for a mass. Of this I made long rowls and put them up the
Nostrils, this I did every Night about an hour and an half before the Patients
going to Bed: being put up the Nostrils, I kept them in with a muffler for
about an hour or more: by this means her head became evacuated of a vast
quantity of filth, and truly, at about 5 or 6 times using of them, more than a
pint and half of water, viscous phlegm, and other evil humors were drawn away;
by which the Head was well cleansed and the sick became very lightsome. During
the days of these Operations I caused her Head, Temples, and Nostrils to be
anointed with this Balsam: Take Oil of Nutmegs by expression, half an ounce,
Oil of Amber, Oil of Anniseeds of each a Dram, mix them, to anoint with,
Morning, noon, and night, for ten or twelve days. Inwardly, after purging we
ordered her to take in the Morning fasting 30 or 40 drops of Elixir
Proprietatis: An hour before dinner 15 or 16 drops of the Elixir of Wormwood:
At dinner time 3 or 4 drops of Oil of Sulphur, 3 or 4 times in the space of
dining: and at night going to be about 30 drops of Tincture of Antimony: this
course to be continued for 40 or 50 days, and the Medicines to be taken in
Beer, Ale, or Wine, as the Patient liked best, but chiefly in Wine for cold
Constitutions. This course was persued, and the sick was perfectly well in two
Months time.

IV. 1. One Job Parsons, a debauched fellow, of about 35 years of Age, of a
Melancholy Complexion, and strong Body, had for about 8 or 10 years time been
troubled with this kind of Headache. 2. He was given much to drinking all sorts
of Liquors, and to great excess; but commonly had for a day or two after, a
most violent and intolerable pain of the Head, sometimes almost to Raving or
Madness. 3. The cause was from the Melancholy humor abounding, which being
rarefied and made thin with the Sulphurous particles of the Liquors which he
drank, ascended up and filled the Ventricles of the Brain, thereby in some sort
obstructing the way of the animal Spirits, and causing them to interfere one
with another. 4. We Cured him thus: first, he was purged with this: Take
Confectio Hamech an ounce, extract of black Hellebor, Mercurius dulcis, of each
twenty four grains: mix them for two Doses: they were given in the morning
fasting two days distant one from another. This done, we gave him the solid
Errhines mentioned in the former Cure, three times; and after all caused him to
take these following Pills every Night for 40 days: Take Ammoniacum strained
one ounce: fine Myrrh, Aloes in fine Powder of each two drachms; with Syrup of
Buckthorn-berries make Pills. By this means the Melancholy humor was overcome,
and the sick became well.

V. An Observation of a violent pain of the Head, arising from the Vencreal
Disease.

1. In pursuance of this, I enquired (as much as I could) into all that had
been done to him before: He had been under four several men's hands, and had
taken a vast quantity of Physic: He had been three times Fluxt; first with
Mercurius Dulcis; next with White praecipitate; and lastly, with Turpeth
minerale: He had been several times let blood, purged, sweat and dieted,
insomuch that he had taken Diet-drinks for more than threescore days; and his
Physicians declared him cured. 2. However, notwithstanding all the assurances
of Physicians, he found himself far from well; for he complained of a vehement
pain of his head, so that at certain times, it made him go almost Distracted;
as to other inconveniences he confessed he found none. 3. After this he
conversed with new Physicians, who told him, That the cause of that
intolerable pain proceeded from Mercury ill prepared, which had got up into
his head and Brain; and in order to bring it away, they new purged him, gave
him Vomits often, made him Issues, applied the Seton, Cupping-Glasses,
Blisters, opened the Temporal Arteries, gave him new Diet drinks, etc. But
these things were all done in vain, for his pain was so far from going away,
that it raged yet much more intollerably; whereupon they gave him over for
incurable. 4. After all these things he applies himself to me, to whom he
related what is before declared. I concluded that Mercury might indeed be
partly the cause, which being elevated, and meeting with differing acid juyces,
might cause a kind of fermentation or working, which struglings and
combinations might upon any commotion of the head, induce that vehement pain.
5. Upon these thoughts I considered what ought to be done in order to this
Cure, wherein I acted only as my Reason directed me; First I concluded, That
the Mercury ought, if possible, to be extracted, but indeed confess my self
ignorant of any way delivered in Authors to perform it, and withal doubted
whether the thing was possible to be done or no; yea, his former Physicians had
advised him to hold Gold for many months in his Mouth, without any success.
Hence it was my Thoughts that the alteration of the humor chiefly, would be
best to be attempted; that although it might, as afore-time, meet with the
Mercury, yet by reason of its sweetness it would not gnaw upon it, whereby
those fermentations, workings and struglings, might in some measure be
prevented, and thereby also the pain of the head. 6. Secondly, I concluded,
That the Alteration of the humor could not be accomplished, but with the
alteration of the habit of the whole body, whereby the Blood and all the other
juyces might be changed to a perfect sweetness. This we thought would be best
accomplished with a Diet fit for that purpose. 7. I enquired what kinds of Diet
those were which he had formerly taken, and found them to be mostly made of
Guajacum and its Bark, whose acid Spirits we have often found to have been the
Cause of such like accidents, after the plentiful taking of Mercury. 8. Being
thus prepossessed, I ordered a Diet to be thus made. Take Spring Water twenty
four quarts, mealy Sarsaparilla two pounds, infuse it warm all Night in the
Water; the next morning take it out, and split it in two or three pieces; after
which boil it for 6 or 8 hours, or till the Liquor is nearly half boiled away,
at what time the water will be of a pretty high color: in this water dissolve
juice of Spanish Liquorice, one Ounce; strain and bottle it up with half an
Ounce of white Sugar and a Glove in each Glass; of this let the Sick take a
Bottle or two every day, not drinking any other Liquor besides, unless upon
some extraordinary occasion. This Diet I continued for almost an hundred days.
9. During the time of taking this Diet, I purged him twice a week, or twice in
8 or 10 days with Aurum Vitae of Sennertus, and with the Lunar Pills, the which
I caused to be given alternately or by turns; first the Aurum Vitae, and about
3, 4, or 5 days after the Lunar Pills, which I gave to gr. iiij. these things
wrought exceeding well; the first upwards and downwards; the latt^r only
downwards; this Alternation was continued for 10 times, viz. 10 Doses of the
Aurum Vitae, and 10 of the Lunar Pills. 10. This course was begun luckily, for
in about a months time he found an apparent abating of his pains, and in about
two months time he felt little or none of them; in 3 months time they were
totally vanished, so that the Patient concluded himself well, as indeed he
proved to be; for it proved according to Our Prognostics, viz. That as the
juyces of the Body became sweetened, so those pains would diminish, decay, and
be perfectly eradicated. Now that Sarsa sweetens the Blood above all other
things by us known, Our large experience has given us a satisfactory
demonstration; but it no ways answers the Intention unless it be long taken,
and the Liquor be made very strong thereof, by boiling therein at least 7 or 8
times the proportion assigned by others.

The Chapter of the Headache continued. Numb. 2. July 29.

VI. Another Observation of an Inveterate Headache; proceeding from a Veneral
Cause.

1. It happened in a young Woman of about 26 years of Age, who seemed to be
cured of the Pox, about 3 years before: However she had remaining this
Inveterate Headache; besides certain large Gummosities in both Shins, which
causing also continual nocturnal pains, brought her into an Atrophia of the
whole Body.

2. This person I cured in all respects as the former; and with as happy a
success: but to her Shins I applied this Vesicatory: Take Crumbs of Bread,
moisten them with Vinegar, with which mix a sufficient quantity of Cantharides
in Powder: this spread upon Leather and apply.

3. This Cataplasm drew large Blisters upon both Legs, which was drawn for
three or four days, and then healed up: after they had been well five or six
days, the Vesicatory was repeated, and then in like manner drawn and healed up:
the same thing was done the third time, after which all the nocturnal pains
vanished, and returned no more.

VII. An old Headache from the violent running of a Race.

1. The Physicians thought this to be from some commotion of the Brain
occasioned from the said violent running; but I think they were deceived, and
rather judge it to be from fuliginous vapors filling the Ventricles of the
Brain, arising from the rarifaction of the juyces of the part and parts
adjacent, through being too much heat.

2. This seemed to be true; for the Disease returned with great violence at
fits; and these fits only came upon him, upon the long exercise of some violent
motion, and the over-heating himself; which caused the humor to be rarefied:
but being over, when he became calm, temperate, and cool, those vapors did
condence, whereupon the pain ceased.

3. In order to his Cure, he had been often purged upwards and downwards, let
Blood, Sweat, had Blisters, Cupping-Glasses, etc. outwardly Anodyn Oils, and
Ointments were applied; the Arteries also were opened, solid Errhines were used
to the Nostrils, with proper and convenient Diets, but all without success.

4. At last, I (with some other Physicians) judged him uncurable, unless the
Skull was opened with a Trepan; which was done at a distance from the Sutures;
by this means the evil Air breathed out, and the Sick was perfectly cured:
after twenty days the Wound was healed up.

5. But this kind of Cure ought with great caution to be undertook, (because of
the Hazard in doing of it;) Or not, without all other things first prove
insuccessful; and withal, you ought to be sure of a Skillful and Experienced
Chirurgian.

VIII. An extreme pain of the Head in a young Virgin.

1. The Maiden was about 14 years of Age, of a sanguine, merry, and cheerful
disposition, not yet having her Courses.

2. The pain was vehement afflicting her whole Head, but chiefly the hinder
part, and it so raged, that it made the Sick almost distracted; having now
continued nine days.

3. Three Physicians were sent for, they all with one consent ordered a
Carminative Clyster to be given overnight. The next day, and for 3 times every
other day, to purge her with a scruple of Cochia minor, they anointed all the
Head with cooling Ointments, for that it seemed to be inflamed; but all these
things did no good.

4. At length I was sent for; a relation was made to me of all that was done,
and my Counsel was earnestly requested. I advised, that with what convenient
speed they could they should apply hot Bread out of the Oven, viz. household
penny Bread, and that it should be laid as hot too, as the Patient could bear,
and every time it cooled to be renewed till the pain was gone: The loaf was
split in the middle, and the crummy part applied. And that likewise the same
should be attempted upon any return of the Paroxism: My advise was followed,
and upon the first application the pain ceased: This very practice I have used
upon many Scores of people with the same happy success.

IX. An Headache with a mighty pain in the Neck.

1. This happened to a married wife of about 35 years of Age: it had continued a
month or more with great vehemence, and resisted all Medicine that for that
space had been applied to her.

2. She was of a pleasant and merry disposition when well, ruddy complexion,
white, smooth and soft skin, so that she seemed to be absolutely Sanguine.

3. The Cause of the pain was from cold taken by going by water; by reason of
which, the violence of it was so great, that at sometimes it created Raving,
and sometimes senselessness, she knew none that came near her, and would talk
idly: moreover, it extremely afflicted the whole Neck, as with a Cramp or
Convulsion, so that she could not turn it without exceeding great pain.

4. In order to her cure, I prescribed this Clyster to be given overnight.
Take fat Mutton Broth twelve ounces, Infusion of Crocus metallorum three
ounces, Oil of Juniper Berries two Drams, mix and exhibit it warm. The next
morning I gave her this. Take Scammony in fine powder, eight grains: Cambogia,
five grains: Cremor Tartari fifteen grains: Crocus metallorum four grains: make
all inro fine powder for one Dose: This was given her the next morning fasting,
it wrought strongly with her both upwards and downwards; the sixth day
following the same Dose was repeated again.

5. In the mean season proper Topics were applied: I ordered her hair to be
cut off, and her whole Head to be anointed with Oil of Amber, as also her
Nostrills and Neck, and then upon her head I applied hot Bread as aforesaid:
which being three times renewed, she became eased, and in seven or eight days
time was perfectly cured.

X. An extreme Headache, arising from the Pox.

1. This was a Woman of 28 years of Age, who had for more than seven years been
tainted with the Pox; she had been twice Fluxt, first with the Neapolitan
Unguent, by anointing, secondly by Turpethum Minerale, given inwardly; the Flux
the first time continued (as she related to me) 20 days; the latter time it was
not fully over till 28 days; afterward she had the common Diet of the
Hospitals for forty days, and was also sweat with several Diaphoreticks, eight
or ten times.

2. Her Constitution was cold, moist, and Phlegmatic, and she was very gross of
body and fat, she eat, drank and slept well, except when these cruel pains
tormented her, which were sometimes three or four nights together about
midnight, and would continue 5 or 6 hours, and sometimes they would begin and
hold three or four days together.

3. The Symptoms concurring were a most filthy and stinking matter running by
the Nose, when this ran well, she had ease: when this ran not, she was
extremely pained: from hence I feared danger, as that the Bone, or some
principal part was corrupted; and so, much doubted the Cure.

4. However, I assayed to do the best for her I could, I ordered her the
Decoction of Sarsaparilla mentioned in Sect. V. aforegoing, and it to be drank
for at least 60 days: but, because of her cold Constitution of Body, I ordered
to that proportion there mentioned, Rosemary, Sage, of each three handfuls,
Sweet-marjoram two handfulls, Contrayerva, Virginia-snake-root, of each 4
ounces, these to be put in 3 quarters of an hour before the end of the boiling.
I also purged her with this: Take Troches Alhandal in powder, four ounces,
Spirit of Wine a quart; Infuse three or four days: Of this she took a spoonful
or spoonful and an half every third day, for 8 or 9 times.

5. As to Topics, I gave her the Sernutatory or Sneezing powder of Deckers,
(whose Composition you may see in our Doron Medicum now in the Press:) this was
blown up her Nostrils four times with good success, by means of which a vast
quantity of filth was brought from her Head, by her Nostrils, so that she did
as it were Flux by the Nostrils: after the fourth time, when the Flux seemed to
cease, she was syringed by the Nostrils with this Lotion: Take Aqua Ophthalmica
Nostra four Ounces (see the way of making it in Our Dispensatory, in Lib. 5.
Cap. 1.) Plantane Water three Ounces, Spirit of Wine one Ounce and an half: mix
them to inject withal. With this her Head was Syringed by her Nostrils three or
four times a day, for 6 or 7 days; after which she became perfectly well to
admiration.

Fountain Water, of each an Ounce: mix them. These he drank, and was well
purged, upwards and downwards, and began to amend.

2. The day after his purgation the Cephalic Vein of his right Hand near his
Thumb was opened, because the pain lay most in the right side of the Head.

3. Also this Epithem was applied. Take twenty live Crabs: Vinegar of Roses,
five Ounces, beat them together in a Mortar, so as to make an Epithem. It was
often applied to his Head, at the beginning of the Cure, whereby the vehement
pain and torment was much allayed.

XIII. The Headache in a young Woman. Cent. 1. Obs. 80.

1. She was twenty one years of Age, and had accompanying with this Headache, a

one Dram and an half, Extract of Ezula, half a Dram, make all into a potion.

3. This she drank, which made her void many Worms both by Stool and Vomit,
whereby she presently grew better. On the third day she drank the same drink
again, by the happy Operation whereof she perfectly recovered.

XIV. A pain in the Head, with noise in the Ears. Cent. 2. Obs. 2.

1. This Observation was upon one John Faber, a man of excellent Piety and
Learning, an industrious Professor in the University of Lauginga; who being
twenty two years of Age, was dangerously pained in his Head, with a sound in
his Ears, which Symptoms were caused by Phlegm and Vapors bred in his Brain, he
was healed after this manner.

2. First he was purged with this. Take Pulvis Sanctus, or powder of Sena
solutive, four scruples: hot Pease Broth, five Ounces, mix them. This Potion he
drank fasting in the Morning, and was well cleansed.

3. After he was purged, this Decoction was given him: Take chips of Guajacum,
four ounces; infuse them all night in four pints of Fountain water: in the
morning add Sweet-marjoram, Stoechas, Penny royal, Origanum, of each half a
pugil: Hyssop, one pugil: Sena, six drams: Bettony flowers, one pugil: blew
Currants, two ounces: boil all in a sufficient quantity of water, till half be
consumed, then strain it. Of this Decoction he took every morning eight ounces
hot, and was very well covered with Clothes, and Sweat much and long for
fourteen days together.

4. His Diet was hot and dry, little in quantity, and seldom eating, and his
Drink was Wine: by this means he was soon restored to his Health.

5. But that the same Infirmities might not for the future attend him, he was
ordered every year in the Spring to take these following Pills. Take Pilulae
sine quibus; and Pilulae Cochiae, of each half a dram, Agarick Trochiseated, a
scruple, with Syrup of Roses of Montanus solutive, make nine Pills, which roll
in Cinnamon Powder.

XV. An Headache, accompanied with many Symptoms. Cent. 2. Obs. 12.

1. A Goldsmith being forty six years of Age, was troubled with a pain of the
Head, accompanied with shortness of Breath, want of Appetite, and pain of the
Stomach, all which by the following things were in a few days perfectly Cured.

2. First there was given him this purging Potion. Take Aqua Benedicta an
Ounce; Bawm Water, an Ounce, Syrup of Hysop half an Ounce, mix them together.
This purged him very well, but did not work a perfect Cure.

3. Wherefore the third day following, I gave him this following Potion. Take
Aqua Benedicta, five drams, Bawm water, one ounce, Syrup of Hysop half an
ounce, mix them: This second potion wrought better and cured all the aforesaid
Maladies.

XVI. A grievous and lasting Headache. Cent. 2. Obs. 37.

1. This man was grievously troubled with this pain, but was cured in this
manner. First he was purged with these Pills: Take Pilulae sine quibus, one
dram, Troches of Agarick, two scruples, with Cinnamon water make all into vine
Pills. These Pills he took at one of the Clock at night, and was well purged.

2. The day following he was let blood in the Median Vein of the right Arm.

3. An Epithema was applied to his Forehead and Temples. Take Women's Breast
Milk, whites of Eggs, of each three ounces, mix them and beat them well
together. In this Linen Cloths was wet gently squeezed, and so applied to his
Forehead and Temples; by this means he was in a few days freed from his misery.

XVII. An Headache, accompanied with Hoarsness, short Cough, and difficulty of
Breathing. Cent. 2. Obs. 40.

1. The man upon whom this was done was about 49 years of Age, he was first
purged with this. Take Extract of Esula two scruples, warm Whey, five ounces:
mix them, strain, and squeeze out the Liquor. This he drank warm in the
morning, and was thereby extremely well purged, and soon after became well.

2. His Diet was hot and Dry: His Meat light suppings, flesh of Hens boiled or
roasted, new laid Eggs, etc. He was allowed for his ordinary drink, Sage Wine,
sometimes Honied Water, in which a little Hysop had been boiled.

XVIII. An Headache with Wheezing and want of Appetite, Cent. 2. Obs. 48.

1. A Widow, about fourscore years of Age, was troubled with the Headache,
accompanied with want of Appetite, stopping in her Breast, frequent quick and
very hard breathing, by reason of her Lungs stuffed with Phlegmatic humors.

2. All these Symptoms though very hard to cure, were (through Gods assistance)
thus removed. Vinum Catharticum Rulandi, the purging Wine of Rulandus. Take
Sena in powder half an Ounce, Troches of Alhandal, one Dram, Ginger, half a
dram, White Wind one pint and half, mix them, and let them infuse all Night. In
the morning for three days together, she drank 3 or 4 ounces of this wine
strained out, with half an ounce of Syrup of Bugloss; which being mixed and
drunk together, as aforesaid, her body was well purged, and she grew every day
better and better.

3. Her body being purged, she did sweat certain days together in her Bed,
having taken six ounces hot, every morning of this following Liquor. Take
Centory one handful, Horehound, Bawm, of each half a handful, Conserve of Roses

of blood was taken away, and she became well: her Diet was heating and
moistning.

4. By the former Potion also was a young Student of 17 years old, cured of a
like Headache and want of Appetite, without letting blood. Cent. 3. Obs. 35.

London, Printed for Th. Dawks, and Langley Curtiss on Ludgate Hill. 1681.

The Chapter of the Headache continued. Numb. 3. August 3.

XX. An Headache accompanied with very many Symptoms. Cent. 2. Obs. 75.

1. It was a Prioress of a Nunnery, she was aged 72 years when she fell into
this Headache, which was accompanied with swimming of the Head, noise in the
Ears, wheezing, shortness of Breath, pain and heaviness of her left side, and a
weakness of the Heart and Stomach.

2. All these Symptoms were caused by the superfluous moisture of the Head and
the Obstruction of her Spleen: Being called to her, I began the method of Cure
thus.

3. Decoctum Catharticum Rulandi; the purging Decoction. Take Sena six drams,
Epithymum one Ounce: Chebulane Myrobalans half an Ounce: Carduus half a
handful, Raisins an ounce and half, Sugar Candy half an ounce, Ginger one Dram;
mix and infuse all in a quart and half a Pint of White wine, three hours; then
boil all over a gentle fire, till half a Pint be consumed. Of this Decoction
she took six ounces hot, in the morning, by which her whole body was without
any trouble very easily and yet plentifully purged; and she was better in every
respect, save to the Giddiness of her head, and noise in her ears.

4. For those Symptoms I ordered this following Lie. Take Marjoram one handful
and half, Pennyroyal one handful, Assarum roots two ounces, Pease one handful,
these things were put into a Bag, and boiled in a sufficient quantity of Lie;
herewith her Head was washed every morning, and a while after dried and covered.

5. After the washing of her head, she snuffed up some of this sneezing powder.
Take Darnel, Nigella Seeds, white Hellebor, of each a Scruple, sweet Marjoram,
Rosemary, Sage, of each half a Dram, Musk two grains; make all into a fine
powder, of which let the quantity of a Pea be blown up the Nostrils in the
morning; by this her head was excellently purged from the remaining humors,
and freed from the aforesaid Symptoms.

6. With this following Liquor she washed her feet every Night. Take Betony,
Pennyroyal of each three handfuls, put them in a bag and boil them in a
sufficient quantity of water; This washing did her Head also very much good.

7. Her Head, Heart and Stomach were in the interim strengthened with this
following Confect, Take Species of Diambra, Diamargariton calidon, of each half
a dram, powder of Bugloss flowers one scruple, Ginger half a scruple, Sugar
dissolved in Bugloss water as much as will suffice, make all up into Lozenges
weighing two scruples a piece. Of these she took one in the morning, and
another after Supper; by which means the deplorable Prioress was soon and
perfectly cured, and has lived many years since sound and in perfect Health.

Observations out of Zacutus Lusitanus.
XXI. A cruel Headache cured by an Issue in the Hand. Cent. 1. Obs. 7.

1. A young man, of a good strong Constitution, long vexed with a most vehement
Headache, having tried many Medicines, for two years together, to no purpose:
He left off his Purgations, and dried up the Issues in his Legs and Arms,
which were designed to evacuate the Humor from his Head, and which he had kept
open for a year together in Vain.

2. At length he had an Issue made in the top of his right hand (for on that
side of his Head the pain did most of all afflict him) betwixt his forefinger
and his Thumb, on the out side, by which he was perfectly cured.

XXII. A pain of the Head cured by applying Horse-Leeches. Cent. 1. Obs. 8.

1. The wisest of the ancient Physicians do in many places of their Writings
maintain, That the Arteries of the Temples may be opened upon occasion; though
by reason of considerable Vessels which run through the Temples, both the
Wounds of those parts are mortal, and the opening of an Artery there, is
dangerous.

2. Now by recourse of humors, and a natural weakness of this part, an
intolerable pain is there raised, together with a frequent palpitation of the
Temples, so as to contemn the efficacy of most Medicaments, yea of Narcoticks:
Yet I have found by sure Trial, that to fasten ten or twelve Horse-Leeches upon
the Temples round about (whereby much dreggy blood is drawn away) does free the
Sick from this most cruel pain: and this is safer by far than to cut the Artery.

XXIII. A Cruel Headache cured by bleeding in the Forehead. Cent. 1. Obs. 10.

1. What great good is done by opening a Vein in the Forehead, Avicen Prince of
Arabian Physicians has declared in these Words: The opening of the Veins of the
Forehead which are between the two eyebrows, is good for heaviness of the
head, and properly for that pain which is in the hinder part of the head, and
for the heaviness of the eyes, and for an old and continuing pain of the head;
which is also confirmed by Paulus, lib. 6. cap. 40.

2. A fleshy young man and ruddy, was for many years troubled with a most cruel
pain all over his head, which most cruelly raged by Fits to the roots of his
eyes: While the pain was present the eyes were red, and looked as if they would
star^ out of his head; Tears ran down involuntarily, which he could feel to be
hot and sharp: In his Face, chiefly on his Cheeks, there was a mighty redness,
with a troublesome motion of his eyes; and being vexed with the pain, he ran up
and down like one mad, yet without any Fever, Thirst or Inflammation.

3. The cause of the Disease was enquired into, which the Physicians with one
consent, thought to be from a thick wind, and plenty of pituitous matter; but
they were mistaken; for I being called, found that this pain did arise from
exceeding hot Blood retained, not at all putrid, but plentiful, overheated and
made sharp, by which the Membranes were afflicted, his head being properly and
primarily affected.

4. The former Physicians used hot remedies both external and internal, as also
sweating Medicines, but all in vain; such things I forsook, and delivered my
Opinion, That the Blood must be drawn out: so, contrary to all their minds, I
opened the Cephalic Vein; I applied Cupping-Glasses with Scarrification to the
hinder part of the head; and at last, having twice opened a Vein in his
Forehead freed him from all his pains.

Observations from Riverius.
XXIV. Headache by being in the Sun. Obs, 121.

1. Anno. 1636. October. 8. A renowned Advocate walked in the Sun about Noon,
going to another Town a good distance off, upon which he was taken with light
Fits of a double Tertian, coming about the Evening; and in his Fit he was
troubled with an extreme Headache; which the first three days, went away with
the Ague Fit in the morning.

2. During this he was twice let Blood, and had one purge given him; but for
all this his Headache and Ague continued; and after the fourth Fit, turned into
a continual Fever, tormenting him as well in the morning as at other times.

3. Now it being manifest that this Headache proceeded from his being in the
Sun, it was feared that there might be some inflammation in his Brain, because
Medicines had been laid to his forehead without any profit.

4. To remove therefore this vehement Symptom, I caused seven ounces of Blood
to be taken from his forehead Vein; whereby his Headache was presently much
abated, and the following Paroxism returned much more gently, with little
Headache; and the next day in the morning he felt no pain at all.

XXV. An Old Headache with other Infirmities. Obs. 11.

1. The Daughter of a renowned Lawyer, 20 years of Age, was vexed with a most
sharp Headache, with a stretching on the Right side under the short Ribs,
Belly-ach and other Symptoms.

2. She used every year many Medicines, as Potions, Apozems, Pills, Baths,
Vesicatories, and many other things, which did her little good; also she was
not much helped by the use of Steel, though all these Symptoms depended upon
Obstructions, and evil humors lodged from her Hypochondria to her Head.

3. At last in the beginning of the Spring, I prescribed this following: Take
Conserves of Wormwood and Maidenhair of each one ounce: Conserves of
Elecampane roots, half an ounce: Salt of Tamarisk, Magistery of Tartar, and my
specific apertive Powder of each half a dram: with Syrup of Maidenhair, make
an Electuary. Of this she took two drams every Morning, fasting two hours after
it.

4. Every fifth day, she was purged with Pilulae Catholicae (or Extractum
Rudij) to the quantity of two Scruples, and within fifteen days she was
perfectly cured.

XXVI. An Old Headache. Obs. 14.

1. The Wife of a certain Lawyer, of a Melancholy disposition, was vexed many
years together with a most vehement Headache, which held her in a manner
perpetually: for the Cure of which a vast number of remedies were prescribed by
Physicians, without any benefit: then she desired my Prescription, which was as
follows.

2. Take Conserves of Wormwood, of Maidenhair, and of Elecampane roots, or
each one ounce: Salts of Wormwood and of Tamarisk of each one dram, with Syrup
of Maidenhair make an Electuary. Of this she took two drams every Morning,
fasting two hours after it.

3. Every fifth day she took two Sruples of Pilulae Catholicae, and with these
Medicaments continued for ten days together, her violent and long lasting pain
was taken away.

XXVII. A Mortal or Deadly Headache. Obs. 37.

1. A Girl of seven years of Age, had for two months been vexed with a vehement
Headache about her Forehead, and Ey-brows, which took her so strongly, that she
wished often times to have her Head laid open with a Knife.

2. Two days before I came to her she had two or three fits of the
Falling Sickness, and foamed: Her Physician had ordered many things, chiefly
Purgations by Apozems; and Cupping Glasses and Vesicatories were applied to her
Neck, but all without effect.

3. Being about to Consult this Case, word was brought, that a new fit had
killed her, after whose Death, some corrupt matter came out at her Nostrils.
Whence might be thought, that an Apostem was secretly lodged in the Brain. The
Head was opened and only a serous or wheyish humor shed into the Ventricles of
the Brain was found therein.

4. This Accident brought into my Mind an Example of a certain Virgin, who
being much afflicted with the like pain for many Months, and having tried
several things to no purpose; a certain Chirurgian shaved of all the Hair from
her Head, and applied thereto a Vesicatory, in form of a Cap; by which Blisters
being raised, a great quantity of Serous Blood and humor flowed out, and so was
cured: which thing probably might have helped this Girl also, if it had been
timely applied.

XXVIII. An Old Headache from the Venereal Pox. Obs. 191.

1. A Man infected with the Pox, was cured by a Sudorifick Diet and a Mercurial
Ointment; and seemed for some time to be Well: but afterward the Disease
returned again; and he again was cured with a Sudorifick Decoction taken for
some days together; he was also fumed with Cinnabar, so that the Cure seemed to
be perfectly done.

2. Yet after, he began to be troubled with a violent Headache on the left side
of his Head, which upon the change of Seasons, and chiefly at the beginning of
Autumn, did mightily torment him, being like a Nail, always fixed in the same
place.

3. When he had tried many evacuating, revelling, deriving, and anodine
Remedies in Vain, he came to me. My opinion was, That this great Headache came
from the Relics of the Pox, not perfectly eradicated: but that the next and
immediate Cause thereof, or at least which excited and increased the pain was,
besides the Pocky Venom, a sharp and biting humor flowing to that part of the
Head: Or, the Mercury it self Collected in that part: Or, a rottenness
contracted in the Skull; which two last Causes, though not frequent, do
sometimes happen, as is to be seen from many Histories in Authors.

4. Now, that respect may be had to all these Causes; in the first place, I
prescribed an universal Evacuation by Phlebotomy, and purgation by Apozems, for
four days: Then a Sudorifick Diet of a Decoction of Guajacum and Sarsa for 30
or 40 days, respect being had to the Temperament; for if it be hotter than
ordinary, it may be corrected with Baths and cooling Broths: many times a Pox
that cannot be cured with Mercury, has been cured by a long use of Decoctions:
and if the Headache arises only from virulent humors: which Vellicate the
Membranes, it may be cured only with a longer use of the said Diet.

5. If the pain gives not way to the Decoction long used, judge if some Mercury
be not gathered together in the part, which may be known by putting a little
Pellet made of leaf Gold, rould up, into the left Nostril, as far as can be,
and pulling it out after a certain time: if then it comes out whitish, it is a
sign there is Mercury. The same may be experimented by covering a Cephalic
Plaster with leaves of Gold, and putting it upon the part pained; if the Gold
turns white, there is Mercury collected in the part, which may be drawn forth
by little and little, if a thin plate of Gold be worn in the pained place, and
a sollid Pellet of Gold be commonly thrust up the Nose.

6. If this remedy does not remove the pain, the part must be opened, the Skull
being bored with a Trepan: for often times the Cranium is gnawn by sharp and
virulent Humors, and corrupted, the Skin remaining whole: and though the
Cariousness or rottenness appear not, yet the Trepan does many times help, by
bringing forth a poisonous matter, collected upon the Tunicles or Membranes of
the Brain.

XXIX. An Intolerable Headache. Obs. 405.

1. A man of fifty years of age, lean, and of a thin texture of body, mightily
prone to anger, was vexed about two years with a vehement pain in his Head, on
the right side thereof, from the top of his Head to his Temples, on the same
side: This pain returned three or four times a year, but when it came upon him,
it forced him to keep his Bed, and was so violent that it brought him almost to
despairation; it was always without any Fever, Thirst, or Inflammation, only
there was a great pulsation of the Artery of that Temple.

2. Being called to him in September, I caused him to be let blood, giving him
a Clyster to cleanse the Bowels. After I gave things to purge Choler, which was
repeated after a few days; he in the interim taking cooling Juleps to prepare
the Choleric humor: Then repelling Medicines and Vinegar of Roses were applied
to his Head; Revulsions were made with Cupping Glasses, both without and with
Scarification, and Frictions were used to his extreme parts: he was again let
blood, and yet his pain went not away.

3. For it returned in the beginning of the next spring, wherefore I gave him
an Emolient cooling Clyster, then, something purging Choler; after I opened the
Artery in the Temple, which was performed by reason of the vehemence of the
pain, and there came five Ounces of blood leaping out.

4. And then applying Lint wet in cold water and binding it on, as is the
practice in ordinary Blood-letting, his pain ceased in half an hours space,
which formerly was wont to vex him many days together; and it returned no more
from that time forward. There might have been applied for more sureties sake,
Galens Emplaster of Frankincense, Mastich, bole Armoniack, and the Wool of an
Hare, with the white of an Egg, and a good Ligature.

XXX. An Headache in a Semi-tertian Ague. Obs. 40.

1. The Admiral of the Spanish Navy was taken at the beginning of September,
with a Semitertian Ague; wherein, among other Symptoms a Vehement and perpetual
Headache did torment him, as bad out of the Fit as in it.

2. He was four times let Blood in the Arm, without any effect at all:
afterward upon the Evening of the sixth day he was let Blood in his right
Ankle, on the Saphena Vein, and the Headache was taken away in the space of an
hour.

The Chapter of the Headache continued. Numb. 4. August 5.

XXXI. A grievous and lasting Headache, Obs. 156.

1. A Woman of Frontinia, being 40 years of age, of a black choleric temper,
suffered Abortion, afterward she wanted her Terms, whereupon a most vehement
Headache vexed her for four Months together; blood-letting, nor Leeches appled
to her Forehead and Temples, nor other Remedies doing her any good.

2. I being sent for, caused her Temporal Arteries to be opened, which was
admirably performed; nor did the blood come out leaping, by reason of the
smallness of the Artery, but drop by drop: there was taken away to the quantity
of five Ounces, red and florid.

3. The Orifice was stopped with a plaster of Mastick only, with a simple
Ligature, and after that, another Ligature, which is wont to be made in Wounds
of the Head: having continued on five hours, her pain ceased, and she was
troubled therewith no more.

XXXII. A stubborn pain of the Head, Obs. 406.

1. A Bawd about 50 years of age, was in October 1644. troubled with a most
cruel pain of the Head, and withal difficulty of breathing, which went and came
by fits, and vexed her most in the Night; and seeing that it could not be taken
away by purging and strengthening Medicaments, applied for a month together, I
mistrusted it to be a Pocky pain.

2. This conception of mine was strengthened, by the weariness which she felt,
which came of it self without labor, by her laziness and loathness to stir,
and because she was sometimes thick of Hearing, and had a noise in her Ears,
the Digestion of her Stomach and Liver was weakened, she was pained and
tormented mightily in the Night upon her shins.

3. The year before, she had often used a Sudorifick Diet, Frictions, with
Mercurial Ointments, and Mercurial Pills: now the time of the year being very
cold, and the condition of the sick, not fit to bear Antivenerials, and withal
conceiving the pain of her Head to be caused from the malignant quality of the
Quicksilver,; I ordered a piece of Gold to be wrapped up, and thrust into each
Nostril, and so kept for some hours, after which they were both colored white
at the ends, and being put a little into the Fire, they recovered their former
color.

4. Another piece of Gold which she held four or five hours in her Mouth, was
taken out white, which being put into hot Coals, the Quicksilver vanished away.
With this remedy often repeated, this cruel pain was wholly taken away, yet with
a little heaviness remaining, as also the shortness of her Breath, and pain in
her Shins: fifteen days after she was taken with a continual Fever and dyed.

Observations out of Platerus.
XXXIII. A Cephalalgia, or new Headache, in a certain Matron.

1. She was about 40 years of Age, and troubled every year with a Fever
Synocha, which cast forth an Erysipelas into her Face: she had a most
intolerable pain in her head, which was from the Crown down the hinder part,
even to her Neck, which by the least touch would be made more vehement, yea, by
the motion of the Head only.

2. For this cause sake, she kept her bed, kept her Head immovable, but felt
an intolerable pricking, without any Remission, sometimes the pain would be so
vehement, as to put her almost beside her Senses.

3. Being called the third day from the first Invasion, besides the aforesaid
Accidents, I found a swift Pulse, and a reddish Urine, but the sick not
thirsty: I ordered a vein of the Arm to be opened, which yielded impure blood:
I forbad her to drink Wine, and ordered in place thereof, boiled water; also to
use Frictions to the extreme parts.

4. The fourth day in the morning, I exhibited this little Potion. Take Manna
one Ounce, Syrup of Roses solutive with Rhubarb, half an Ounce: mix them. Let
it be given with Broth, about noon she fainted, afterward she had two Stools.

5. The fifth day in the morning, I applied four little Cupping Glasses to both
Shoulders, which was repeated in the Evening, by what time she was much better,
but a while after the pain returned, and the following Night was troublesome.
And because the pain was the most extreme toward the nape of the Neck
suspecting the matter to descend that way, especially when I saw the Glandules
under the left Ear to swell, I ordered Wool moistened with Oil of Lillys, to be
applied, and to be bound on with Linen cloth about the Neck.

6. The sixth day, the pain not remitting, the Cupping-Glasses were repeated
with Scarification: about noon she was very sick and fainted, and had a kind of
Delirium: at night, when this pain did not in the least remit, I ordered her
feet to be washed and soaked in a Decoction of Sage and Camomil, made with Lie
and Wine: by which she immediately found ease. About the time of Sleep, I gave
her this: Take Lettice-water one Ounce, Betony-water half an Ounce, Syrup of
Poppies three Drams, Syrup of the Juice of Citrons, half an Ounce, mix them. To
the Neck I applied this. Take Bran two Pugils, white Poppy-seed a Dram and
half, Red Roses, Galangal, of each a Dram: Mastich three Drams, let them be
bruised, well sprinkled with Wine, and applied in a Bag. She slept quietly, and
the pain was mitigated.

7. The seventh day she was very weak: I gave to comfort her, Conserve of Roses
and Marjoram; and continued the washing of her Feet twice a day to the eighth
day. And because the sharp and pricking pain ceased, but a heavy dull pain
afflicted her, I ordered her a Cap to be made, of the ingredients in the former
bag, adding Coriander seed and Orrice roots in powder, of each two Drams.

8. The tenth day the Defluxion fell into her Shoulders, Armholes and Breast,
but without any great pain; I ordered the little Potion at 4. aforegoing, and
she grew well.

XXXIV. An old Headache, with a breaking forth of the Head, obs. Lib. 2.

1. It happened commonly for many years, to a Woman the Mother of many Children,
that she could not void her Excrements by Stool, except she took some purging
thing made of Sena, or the like: This woman at length was taken with the
Headache, which proved a Cephalaea, as also with breakings out among her hair,
which became a Crust, proceeding from a yellowish Ichor issuing from the skin,
and feeding upon it.

2. This deformity for a whole year and longer seemed hidden, but at length was
healed by the use of many drying Lixiviums, but so as the vehement pain of the
Head still remained: whereupon considering the affect, I persuaded that the
Flux of matter should be again recalled to the Head.

3. I tried first by a Sinapism thus made: Take Mustard Seed, two parts:
Pigeons Dung, half a part: Marjoram, Rosemary-Flowers, of each one Dram: mix
them: apply it plaisterwise, without shaving off the Hair.

4. But although the Head grew red and burned, yet the matter returned not, but
the pain grew greater. Then I applied a Vesicatory to the middle of the Head,
made of Flammula or Spear-wort bruised, which drew a large Blister; from which
being broken and opened, a great quantity of humor flowed forth, and presently
the pain of the Head ceased, nor has it returned, that I know of to this day:
the raw place was covered with a Colewort Leaf, anointed with Butter. This is a
good Observation.

XXXV. An Old Headache, with pain of the Womb, Obs. Lib. 2.

1. A certain Matron complained of a pain of the Head, and a pain of the Womb,
about which time her Terms used to flow. The pain was about the bottom of her
Belly and Region of the Loins, at a certain time, with a weakness of the whole
body; to which was joined a periodick pain of the Head, called by the Ancients
Cephalaea.

2. I first purged the Body four or five days with this Wine. Take Roots of
Fennel, Orrice, Calamus Aromaticus, of each half an Ounce: Tamarisk Bark, six
drams, leaves of Mugwort, Motherwort, Betony, Pennyroyal, of each a handful:
flowers of Borrage, Hypericon, Broom, of each a Pugil: Bay Berries, Mechoacan,
of each three Drams: Rhubarb, two Drams: Spikenard, one Dram: Carthamus Seeds
two Ounces: Sena, one Ounce and half: Agrick Trochiscated half an Ounce: white
Wine, six pounds: infuse and macerate in a double Vessel, for two days: then
use it.

3. Then I prescribed these Table. Take Species Diamargariton calid, one Dram,
Species, Aromaticum Rosatum, and Diagalanga, of each half a Dram: prepared
Coral, two Scuples: Species Cordialium, one Scruple: Sugar (dissolved in
Mugwort-water) six Ounces: mix and make Tables: Take one weighing one Dram
every other day.

4. Lastly, apply this following Plaster for some Nights, to the Share, and
also for some time to the Region of the Kidneys. Take Emplastrum pro matrice, a
sufficient quantity, malax it with Nard-Oyl, spread it on Leather and lay it to.

5. To the Head, apply this Emplaister: Take one part of Emplastrum de Ranis
(which is wonderfully effectual in curing an old Headache) and a half part of
Emplaster of Betony, and of Alablaster: mix them, and apply it over the whole
Crown, and hinder part of the Head.

6. Moreover, you may often wash the Head with this Lixivium. Take Lie (made of
Oak-Ashes and burnt Bones) four pounds: Smiths-Water, four Ounces: in which
boil leaves of Betony, Sage, Celtick Spike (or Lavender) of each one handful:
Flowers of Rosemary, Camomil, Red Roses, of each a Pugil: Agarick half an
Ounce: seeds of Nigella, half a dram. After the washing, make a Fume with
Mastich, Frankincense, Amber and Benjamin, of each equal parts. Thus she grew
well, and lived a long time.

XXXVI. A contumacious pain of the Head, that could be helped by no Medicines.
Cent 4. Obs. 70. and 71.

1. A man about 40 years old, of a Phlegmatic Constitution, was troubled with
a sharp and violent pain of the Head; to which many things were appled by a
famous Coloniensian Physician, but without any cessation of the pain.

2. At length I being called into Council, persuaded to adhibit to him the
Setaceum: I applied it in the presence of the aforesaid famous Colonian
Professor, and it happily succeeded, so that from that day he found a sensible
mitigation of the Pain.

3. Six Months being elapsed, I permitted the Setaceum to be healed up, and in
place thereof made an Issue in the left Arm, as being a thing of less trouble.

XXXVII. A Pain of the Head with a Catarrh. Cent. 4. Obs. 71.

1. A certain Noble Person, about thirty years old, was troubled with a pain of
the Head, accompanied with a Catarrh falling down upon the Breast, and a
continual Cough, with an extenuation of the whole Body, under which he labored
for many years, and had used many Medicines, from learned Physicians, but all
in vain.

2. I coming to him, applied a potential Cautery to both Arms, and that a
little time after, he was first freed from the pain of his Head, then from the
other Symptoms, so that he was perfectly cured.

Observations out of Forestus.
XXXVIII. A pain of the Head from vehement labor. Lib. 10. Obs. 4.

1. A young man, extremely Choleric, very Studious, but of a weak Brain, or
using too much Exercise, may easily be taken with a pain of the Head: this
patient having vehemently exercised himself, was seized with a most signal pain.

2. Being called to him, and understanding the Cause, as aforesaid; I
prescribed this Syrup to be taken. Take Syrups of Violets, of Water-Lillys, of
Endive, of each half an ounce: Waters of Lettice, Succory and Endive, of each
one ounce: mix them.

3. Then I ordered the fore part of the Head and Forehead, to be Bathed with
this. Take Oils of Roses and Violets, of each one ounce: Rose Water, two ounces
and an half: Vinegar, Juyces of Lettice, Housleek, of each half an ounce: mix
them.

4. Moreover I ordered the Forehead to be anointed with Oil of Gourds, mixed
together with Vnguentum Populeum. When he was inclined to sleep, and found a
little cessation from his vehement pain; I ordered him a cooling and moistning
Diet, so was he quickly and safely restored to his desired Health.

XXXIX. A pain of the Head, arising from Cold. Lib. 9. Obs. 6.

1. A Regular Monk, of sixty years old, in a most sharp Winter, was taken with
pain of the Head, by going a Journey through the Snow: when I came to him, his
Head in touching seemed to me to feel cold, his Face was grown pale; he was
comforted by warmth, and hurt by cold.

2. From these Symptoms being present, and the aforegoing Causes, I easily
understood the pain to proceed from a simple cold Intemperature, without Humors
or matter.

3, Wherefore I presently made the foreparts of the Head, to be anointed with
Oils of Dill, Camomil and Rue mixed together, so long till the pain was eased,
he being in his Bed Chamber, warmed with a bright or clear Fire, and remaining
there for some days.

4. After three or four days, he goes abroad again, but falls into the same
pain, and a Catarrh also seizes him, which caused him to be troubled with a
pituitous matter, as in phlegmatic Persons is seen; for this cause sake, I
exhibited, these Pills, viz. Pilulae Alephanginae; then I prescribed this
Decoction. Take Betony, Marjorum, Sage, Bay Leaves, of each a like; make a
Decoction, make a Decoction in fair water, which sweeten well with Syrups of
Staechas and Oxymel simple.

5. Afterward, I purged him with this. Take Pilulae Cochiae, half a dram, make
it into five Pills with Syrup of Stoechas. These were swallowed about midnight,
and he had about five or more Stools; not long after which, the pain ceased.

6. To strengthen the Head, and dry up the Catarrh, this Cucufa or Cap, may be
applied to the Head. Take Red Roses dried, Betony dried, of each one Dram: Gum
Sandarach, Mastich, Myrtle Berries, of each half a Dram: Macer, or instead
thereof Mace, one Scruple, make a gross powder, and quilt it up in a Cap, about
the bigness of the palm of ones Hand, to be applied to the Crown of the Head.

7. The same Powder, well beaten, and sifted through a Sieve, may be made into
the consistency of a Cerate, with Gum Labdanum, Wax and Oil of Camomil, and
applied (being spread upon Leather) to the Head, as aforesaid: both these
Compositions will free the sick from a Catarrh, at which time soever they are
applied, at least they shall make the Flux much less.

XL. A pain of the Head, cured by purging the Brain. Lib. 9. Obs. 18.

1. A certain Woman was at times affected with a pain in the Head, to whom many
Medicaments were applied: at last, after Universal Remedies were adhibited, she
was delivered from her pain, by this Masticatory, which brought away a large
quantity of Phlegm, by the Palate and Mouth. Take Mastick one Dram: Pellitory of
Spain one Scruple: powder them, with a little Oil of bitter Almonds, enough to
conglutinate them; make five Troches or Tables. To be chewed one in a morning
fasting, for the space of near half an hour.

2. One Melchior Gerard, having long laboued under a pain of the Head, it
returning often at times, and being also troubled with a constant Catarrh,
after the use of many approved universal purging Medicines; the Head was
cleansed by the use of this following Errhine. Take juice of Beets mixed with
Clarified honey six ounces, let it be snuffed up the Nose; it also prevails
against a Cephalaea or old Headache.

3. This following also may be used not only in a pain of the Head, but also to
divert a Catarrh by the Nose. Take juyces of Beets and Rue of each one ounce:
juice of Marjoram half an ounce, mix them, and let the Errhine be injected up
the Nose in the Morning, the Stomach being fasting, the Mouth being first
filled with Beer or Water and close shut; and the other Nostril being stopped.

CHAP. II. Of the MEGRIM. Numb. 5. August 10.

The Authors Observations.
I. AHemicrania, or Megrim proceeding from the Pox.

1. A young Frenchman of about 25 years of Age, having been lately cured of
the French Disease (as he thought) being first flux'd by anointing with the
Neapolitan Ointment, and afterward having taken the common Diet of Guajacum
for 40 days, with Purgations every fifth day between, seemed to be perfectly
well: but about three weeks after the ceasing of his Diet, he was seized with a
most violent Megrim, or pain on one half his head, viz. on his right side.

2. It began from the beating of the Temples, and went down to the Sagital or
Arrow-like Suture, which divides the head long-waies. Its return was commonly
every third or fourth day, about 9 in the morning, continuing in great
extremity, till about 9 the next morning, but growing most vehement toward
night.

3. The Cause was without doubt the Venom of the French Pox not totally
eradicated, whose poisonous quality does not only torment the Periostion and
Pericranium, causing outward pain, but also the Films and Menings of the Brain,
thereby causing an inward pain: whereby these pains proceeding from the Pox,
commonly are very extreme; and this last may be so much the more probable, for
as much as many Headaches proceed simply from the natural weakness of the Brain
and parts adjacent: and what can be thought more to weaken the Brain than a
malignant Pox, which has seized the head, and filled its Ventricles with many
Excrements.

4. The Patient was of a brisk sanguine Complexion, had a ruddy Countenance,
merry and cheerful, given to riding, hunting and such like: he eat and drank
well, so also he took his natural rest, and seemed no way discomposed but when
this vehement pain seized him.

5. When the pain was upon him he found good by things neither hot nor cold,
nor yet by any kind of Unction whatsoever: moreover pellets of Gold were put up
his Nostrils, but we could not perceive the least appearance of Quicksilver;
so that I concluded, it was from some poisonous matter (now to be evacuated)
and the contamination of the part by the malignity of the Pox.

6. Hence it appeared that in order to the Cure, I was not only to correct and
alter the Virulency of the Humor, but also to evacuate the matter already
gathered, and to corroborate and strengthen the parts so emptied and weakened.

7. But his pain being Extreme, we were forced to lay-by the orderly Method of
Art, and first make use of Opiates: although Opiates are known to be very hurtful
in any Headache whatsoever: but what we gave was this well corrected Laudanum
following. Take Opium, four ounces, dissolve it in Spirit of Wine a sufficient
Quantity: strain it, and evaporate it to the Consistency of an Extract; this
done, Take the Oil of Salt half an ounce: common water distilled, a pint: mix
them well, in this mixture dissolve the aforesaid Extract: digest ten days,
then evaporate the Liquor almost to dryness: the Extract at bottom mix with
Virgin Honey, an ounce or somewhat more, Oils of Sassafras, one dram, of
Rosemary and Wormwood, of each half a dram: mix all well together into a
Laudanum. Of this I gave him first, five grains: and about 24 hours after I
gave him seven grains more, dissolved in 2 or 3 spoonfuls of Sack; it gave him
ease for the present, without any kind of Injury.

8. I now fell upon the methodick practice of Cure; and, by Reason his head and
face, chiefly his right side was swelled with the pain; after the Exhibition of
this Clyster: Take Mutton broth, twelve ounces; Infusion of Crocus Metallorum,
two ounces: Tincture of Colocynthis made in spirit of Wine, one ounce: oil
olive, two ounces and a half: mix and give it warm, at six a clock at Night. I
gave the next morning, a Dose of the Lunar Pills, (whose Composition, and way
of using, you may see in my Dispensatory, Lib. 3. Cap. 11. Sect. 21.) the
fourth morning from thence, I gave an ounce of this following Tincture. Take
Spirit of Wine, a Pint: pulp of Colocynthis shred small, two Ounces: Anniseeds
Bruised, two Drams: Coriander-seed bruised, one Dram: Cloves well bruised, half
a Dram: mix, and digest warm for ten days, shaking the vessel every day: then
keep it for use; giving only the clear Liquor, with observation, as in other
purges.

9. During the Exhibition of these things, which might have respect to the more
internal Cause, I was careful to cleanse the Head, both outwardly and inwardly,
of all the Malign matter: outwardly I caused the Hair to be shaved off from all
the right side, and applied thereto, the common Vesicatory of the Shops, which
in 10 or 12 hours did draw a very large Blister, from which a very great
quantity of water ran: this very thing gave him much ease.

10. I also cleansed the Head inwardly, by exhibiting at Night these following
Errhines: Take Confectio Hamech, two Drams: powder of Scamony, Gutta Gamba,
Agarick, of each one Dram: powder of Euphorbium, one Scruple: mix and make long
Pellets, or rouls to put up the Nostrils: This brought away such a vast
quantity of filth from the Head, by the Mouth and Nose, that had I not seen it,
I could not have believed it from the Mouth of another. The Pellets being put
up the Nostrils, I caused the Nose to be bound close with a Muffler, for an
Hour and quarter; and after the whole working was over, I ordered the sick to
repair to his Bed, and to keep his Head warm: These Errhines I repeated twice
more.

11. The Lunar Pills, and the aforesaid Tincture, at 8 aforegoing, I caused
alternately to be be given, every fourth day: and upon the Blister, I applied
Melilot-Plaster simple, twice every day till it was well.

12. But that I might confirm the Cure, by taking away the radical Cause, which
was the contaminated Habit of the Body, I ordered the following Diet, made of
many Alexipharmicks; remembering therein the Opinion of Sennertus, who thinks
that Counter-poysons can never be better given, than in the malignity of the
POX. The Diet was this, Take Gentian, Zedoary, Sassafras, Contra-Yerva,
Virginian Snake-Roots, Bay Berries, Juniper Berries, of each four Ounces:
Rosemary, Marjoram, Sage, Betony, Vervain, Dittany, all dry, of each three
Ounces: Cloves, Mace, Cinnamon, Coriander-seed, Carraways, of each half an
Ounce: choice and mealy Sarsa, two pounds: let all be well bruised, and infused
in Limewater, six Gallons, over a gentle heat for 10 days: keeping afterward,
for 20 days more, the Liquor upon the Faeces: at which time, you may decant the
clean Liquor, and keep it in clean Glass Bottles, close stopped, for use. Of this
he took a quart a day, till the quantity aforesaid was wasted; and in about
five weeks time, was perfectly cured: this Diet not only altering the Humors,
and Habit of the Body, but also strengthening the Head, Brain, Bowels, and other
parts weakened.

II. A Megrim, proceeding from a Hot Scorbutic Habit of Body.

1. This happened in a woman somewhat more than forty years of Age, of a hot, dry
and choleric habit of Body, and sufficiently contaminated with the Scurvy.

2. She had wandering pains up and down, all over her body; her Teeth were many
of them perished with the Scorbutic Taint; she had many reddish spots in her
Arms, upon her Breasts and Shoulders, as also upon her Thighs and Legs, and
she complained that for more than 10 or 12 years last past, she had been
troubled with many Hot, Choleric and Fiery Eruptions of the Skin; and indeed
she had a general weakness and indisposition over her whole body: her belly for
the most part bound, her stomach weak, and her Digestion very bad.

3. She had been with many Physicians, some of whom thought it to be the
Scurvy, as aforesaid; others thought it to be the Pox; but the honesty of the
Woman's Life, her upright Conversation, and the Company she associated her self
withal, forbad those suspicions, as also because she had never the prime or
Original Symptoms of the Pox: moreover, her Husband was a man of good repute
and fame, and one who had lived 20 years last past, in good Health, whereby
nothing of suspicion could arise from him: These things confirmed me in my
thoughts.

4. This pain was certainly within the Skull, for it was not outward at all,
but extreme also at the root of the left Eye. Now it may be either in the Dura
Matter, or in the Pia matter, and these two being the one thick and the other
thin, and both close joined together, and to their Vessels, it may be hard to
distinguish which of them is most affected; but if the Dura Matter be afflicted,
the pain must be outward; because of the Pericranium which is joined unto it.
If the Pia matter is afflicted, the pain is deeper, and in the Brain as it were.
In both, the pain may come to the roots of the Eyes, because the Balls of the
Eyes have Tunicles, from the Membranes of the Brain. And in regard both
Tunicles are distinct with the Brain long-ways, it happens, that if the Disease
be only on one side, that only one half of the Head is pained, which we call
the Megrim; but if on both sides, the pain is also on both sides. Some say,
there can be no pain in the substance of the Brain, because the substance of
the Brain is insensible: but we know, that those parts of the Brain, to which
the tender Film or Meninx grows, and which produce the sensitive Nerves, cannot
be without sense, and may give occasion of pain with the Mennings, by consent;
but in this case, the pain is rather stupifying than sensible.

5. Now as this pain happened in a Hot Scorbute, so without doubt, it was caused
by a praeternatural Heat, and spirituous Blood overheated, which be degrees
weakening the Brain and parts adjacent, might make it the more ready to suffer
such an affliction; as we commonly see, after long Diseases of the Head,
Wounds, French Pox, etc. In all which there is a continual gathering of
Excrements in the Head.

6. In order to the Cure, I thought is necessare to apply Medicaments to remove
the Cause. She had been tampering with many Physicians before, who supposing it
to be the Scurvy, had loaded her with Spirit of Scurvy Grass,
Horse-Radish-Roots, Brooklime, Watercresses, Mustard Seed, etc. and given the
juyces of those things likewise in her Drink, with gentle purgings, but these
things were so far from curing her, that they made her Disease to rage so much
the more vehemently.

7. She applies her self to me, desiring to know a Reason, why such things as
were eminent against the Scurvy, and had cured several others, to her
knowledge, should do her no good at all, but make her Disease much worse? To
whom I Answered, That in the Scurvy, in cold Constitutions, those things might
have their desired effects: but if the Scurvy did chance in a hot and inflamed
body, their effects would be quite opposite: yet it was my Opinion, that had
those things been over-poured with Coolers, and proper Acids, she might have
had some good by them.

8. Overnight I ordered this Clyster, Take Quercetan his purging Decoction,
Eight Ounces: Oil of Roses, four Ounces: Cassia extracted for Clysters, two
Ounces: Sugar, one Ounce: mix, and give it warm. This I ordered to be exhibited
every other night, the next morning I gave this Purge. Take Extracts of Rhubarb
and of Agarick, Rosin of Jalap, of each four Grains: Sal Armoniack, three
Grains: Elaterium, two Grains: Tartar Vitriolate, ten Grains: Oil of Lavender,
one Drop: mix, and make Pills for one Dose. This I repeated, every fourth or
fifth morning.

9. In this interim of Purging, I prescribed this following, to be taken every
morning fasting, to six Ounces: Take Parsley water, two Pounds: Juyces of
Plantane and Fumitory clarified, of each one Pound and an half: Juyces of
Oranges, three Pound: mix them. At noon I ordered this to be taken. Take
Plantane Water, a Pint, Syrupus de-quinque radicibus, three Ounces: Spirit of
Sal Armoniack, a Scruple: mix them, for three Doses, to be taken for three
days, just before Dinner. At Night this. Take Fumitory-Water, a Quart:
Hartshorn calcined, half an Ounce: Sal Prunellae, three Drams: mix, boil all a
quarter of an Hour, then strain and sweeten with Syrup of Hart's-tongue. Give it
for four Doses, for four Nights going to Bed. This Course I continued with her
for three Weeks.

10. Lastly, that I might the more effectually cool the Blood, and alter the
hot Constitution of the Body, I Ordered her to take Oil of Salt, in all the
drink she drank, and to make it as tart as she could well endure it, and this
to do at least 5, 6, or 7 times a day: by following this Counsel, she became
perfectly well, in about three weeks time; being freed as well from her Scurvy,
as her Megrim.

III. A Megrim proceeding from a Scorbute in a Cold Constitution.

1. This is a famous Example: An ancient Woman about 55 years old, who had at
times been for more than seven years troubled with this Pain, (which as all
Physicians judged, and truly enough, to proceed from the Scurvy) she had
diversity of Symptoms in the Skin, as Spots in the Legs, Pustules and Ulcers,
swellings in the Gums, looseness of Teeth, and a kind of Erratick Itching all
over her whole body: to which add this violent pain over the one half of her
head.

2. She had been under other Physicians hands, who had often let her Blood,
cup't her upon each Shoulder, had Issues in both Arms and both Legs, given her
Clysters, and purged her with a vast number of Cephalic Pills, but all to no
purpose.

3. After all this she came to me, requesting my Directions, and declaring all
that had been done, as aforesaid; by which I perceived they had not levelled at
the cause of the pain, but directed their aim at a wrong mark: When I had a
little viewed and examined the Woman, I found the Scurvy to be the root of the
matter; and the Scurvy in a cold Constitution; and therefore thought in my own
Breast, That unless I directed my intentions of Cure to that, I should
necessarily miss the desired end, as well as those who had gone before me.

4. In the first place I cleansed her Bowels with this Clyster: Take Mutton
Broth twelve ounces, Tincture of Colocynthis an ounce and half, Oil of Aniseeds
one dram, well mixed with Sugar, three ounces; put all together and give it
warm. In all her Drink (but chiefly in Horseradish wine) to take about 12 or
14 drops of Spirit of Sal Armoniack four or five times a day: I gave her a dram
of Sal Vitrioli in Chicken Broth, which I repeated every morning for three
times, then I purged her four times; twice with the Lunar Pills, and twice with
the Golden Spirit of Life, of Rulandus, (the making of which see in my
Dispensatory: giving them alternately every third day.

5. When all these things were done, I ordered her to drink the Antiscorbutick
Wine of Mynsicht (see it in my Dispensatory lib. 4. cap. 12. sect. 11.) for 14
or 16 days together, dropping into every draught thereof 8 drops of the Spirit
of Sal Armoniack aforementioned.

6. For Topics I ordered to her head hot Bread, and it to be repeated as
occasion required; then the places pained to be bathed with Powers of Amber and
Juniper Berries, of each a like quantity mixed together: Lastly, That the
Ventricles of the Brain should be evacuated with the solid Errhins mentioned in
Cap. 1. Sect. 4. 5. foregoing.

7. And to consummate the Cure, I ordered my Patient the Electuarium ad Tabidos
(which see in my Doron Medicum lib 2: cap. 22. s^ct. 1.) to be taken every
morning fasting, and just before Dinner, a dram at a time: it not only
strengthens and comforts all the weakened and enfeebled parts, but is a most
excellent Cephalic, and a very great Antiscorbutick. And at Night going to
Bed, an ounce of the Conserves of Scurvygrass, Watercresses and Brook-lime
made up into a Mass with Sugar, the Herbs being in equal proportion; Thus in a
months time, the Sick became perfectly well.

IV. A Megrim proceeding from a certain foulness of the Stomach.

1. This was in a Plough-man of near 40 years of Age; and had been of about a
twelve months continuance: The man was of a black swarthy Countenance,
dull-spirited, slow both of motion and speech; and of a cold, dry and
melancholy habit of body.

2. His great Complaint was, of a heaviness at Stomach, bad appetite and worse
digestion; so that sometimes he Vomited up what he had received, with a great
deal of other thick, black and nasty matter.

3. I gave him an ounce of the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum mixed with an
ounce of Oxymel of Squills, and three ounces of Carduus water: with this he
purged both upwards and downwards, and his Stomach seemed to be well cleansed;
five days after I repeated the same; and again a third time, and he became well.

The Chapter of the Megrim continued. Numb. 6. August 13.

V. A Megrim arising from Blood overheated.

1. A young man of a good habit and constitution of body, over-heating himself
in Hay-time or Harvest, fell into a very strong Fever, with a mighty pain on
the right side of his head: The Country people used many things to him, whereby
his Fever was mightily abated, or in a manner gone: but the pain of his head
continued.

2. He came to me, and gave as clear a Description as he could of his Disease,
by which I found that the true Cause was too great a heat and fermentation of
the Blood, not yet totally suppressed.

3. I ordered him Spirit of Sal Armoniack 12 drops to be taken in fair water,
morning and night, and to be continued for about 10 days time: During which
time I ordered him to Drink 5, 6, or 8 drops of Oil of Sulphur in all the drink
he drank; and to take it about 5 or 6 times a day; by this means the heat of
his Blood was allayed, and the pain went away without any kind of Purging.

VI. A Megrim proceeding from a Stomach oppressed with Phlegm.

1. A certain young Lady, 18 years of Age, inclining to a grossness of body,
had for two years time been afflicted by Fits with a violent Megrim on the left
side of her Head; she seemed when the Pain was off from her, to be in perfect
Health, except only a kind of heaviness at Stomach; she would also sometimes
Vomit Phlegm: Moreover when the Fit was upon her, if she could but Vomit, the
pain certainly and immediately went away: and the matter she always Vomited,
was a cold, thick, viscous or tough Phlegm.

2. The Cause seemed to be from the weakening of the inner coat of the Stomach,
which is a production of the Dura meninx, by the weight and coldness of the
Phlegm; as also from the hurt of the Stomatick Nerves (by the same cause) which
spring from the Par vagum, or sixth pair (as they are commonly accounted)
within the Skull: and hence is the Truth of that common saying among People,
That if the Stomach be ill, the Head cannot be well; which is indeed from the
consent of Parts joined by the common mediums.

3. She making her Complaint to me, and I apprehending it to proceed from an
oppression of the Stomach by Phlegm, advised her to take a gentle Vomit which
might evacuate that viscous matter. I gave her six drams of Salt of Vitriol,
ordering one dram to be given in a morning fasting: and so every other day, so
long as she vomited Phlegmatic matter: The dram of Salt of Vitriol was divided
into three parts, a scruple in a part; she took one scruple dissolved in Broth,
which gave her a Vomit: after that Vomit she took another scruple in Broth, and
drank also a little Broth after it; which gave her another Vomit: then she took
the last Scruple, as aforesaid; by all of which she had 5 or 6 Vomits, the
whole matter coming forth being little else but a viscous tough Phlegm.

4. She took but 5 drams of the said Salt in 10 days, and her Stomach was
perfectly cleansed, and the last time she Vomited, was a yellowish, greenish
substance, thin and free from Viscosity; upon which I forbad her taking the
last dram; the whole quantity of the Viscous Phlegm thus ejected forth in these
five days of Vomiting, was proved by weight to be somewhat more than 12 pounds.

5. By the use of this alone Medicament was this vehement headache perfectly
taken away, and the Stomach of the Sick thoroughly cleansed, whereby she enjoyed
her Health very well for several years after: However to strengthen the
Stomach, Brain, and other parts weakened, I advised her to take every morning
and evening, for 14 or 20 days a, dram at a time of our Electuarium ad Tabidos;
and now and then a Glass of Wormwood Wine. See the said Electuary in our Doron
Medicum. lib. 2. cap. 22. sect. 1.

VII. A Megrim arising from a great blow on the Head.

1. This happened to a young fellow of 22 years of Age: There was a great Tumor
with vehement pain, a Fever was excited, with restlessness and a great Thirst.

2. Inwardly I immediately gave this. Take Sal Prunellae, a dram; white Sugar,
two ounces; Aqua Celestis, one ounce and half; Parsley water, a quart; mix them,
and give three or four Spoonfuls at a time; This cooled his Fever, and took
off his vehement Thirst: moreover, I ordered him drops of Oil of Sulphur, to be
dropped into all his other drink he drank; by this means his Belly was kept
soluble, and the Blood overheated was cooled, for all Mineral waters, viz.
such as come from Vitriol, Sulpher, Niter, or Salt, wonderfully cool and
penetrate above all other things, and immediately mix themselves with the
Sanguinous mass, whereby that is performed in an Hour or two, which by other
things could not be performed in so many days.

3. Outwardly he was anointed with this Oil: Take Oils of Dill and
Water-Lilly, of each half an Ounce; Opium and Camphir, of each a Scruple;
dissolve the Camphir in a little spirit of Wine; then dissolve the Opium in
like manner, which two dissolutions mix with the Oils; and therewith anoint the
part afflicted: by the use of this two or three times, the pain went away, the
Tumor abated, and the sick in about three days time was perfectly well.

VIII. A Megrim with a violent Cough and shortness of Breath.

1. An ancient Man 76 years of Age, had for ten Months or more, labored under
a vehement pain of his Head, on his left side, which pain commonly returned
upon him, once in two or three days: he was mightily afflicted with Phlegm, and
complained much of a trickling Rheum, which he felt running down his Throat.
This Rheum as he thought, excited his Cough, and when the Cough became violent
and lasted long, it stirred up that almost intolerable pain, in the one side
of his Head.

2. He was advised to, and used many things, but without any good; at last an
old Woman advised him to this Electuary following, of which he was to take as
much as a large Nutmeg, 4, 5 or 6 times a day. Take of the best Virgin Honey,
ten ounces: Ginger in fine powder, eight ounces: Red R^ses in fine powder, one
ounce and a half: Spirit of Sulphur, enough to make it as sour as he could well
endure it; mix all together into a mass. Of this the old man did take for at
least 6 Weeks, and found much good in it; it took away his Catarrh, comforted
his Stomach, and stopped his Cough, whereby the pain of his Head was lessned, or
at least it came more seldom, tho, at the fit, with the same vehemence as
before.

3. After all this he applied himself to me, related to me how he had been, and
gave me an Account of the aforegoing Electuary, from which he had received so
much good: I liked well the Electuary, and ordered him the continuation
thereof, but caused him to vomit four several times with Salt of Vitriol, given
a Dram at a time in a little Broth, in the morning fasting, which wrought well
with him, and brought away a great deal of cold, slimy and viscous matter.

4. Lastly, to warm and comfort the Somach and parts weakened, I ordered him to
take inwardly, The blood red Tincture of black Pepper, made by digesting black
Pepper in Spirit of Wine to redness: of this he took about 12 drops, three or
four times a day, in a Glass of Canary. Outwardly I caused his Head to be
Anointed with Oil of Amber, five or six several times, and then to be bound up;
and often to smell to Spirit of Hartshorn, taking also the Salt of Hartshorn
inwardly, ad gr. sixteen, in Wine, twice a Week: by this means he was made very
well, in little more than a months time.

IX. A Megrim with a Catarrh, and Scirrhus Tumor of the Spleen.

1. A certain man, 40 years of Age, had for about two years and an half, been
extremely troubled with a great pain, on the left side of his Head, and a
Catarrh or Rheum falling down upon his Lungs.

2. He was much troubled with Phlegm, fleshy, and inclinable to be fat; howbeit,
this extreme pain, with that Flux of Humors (as he thought) falling upon his
Lungs, had reduced him, even to a Skeleton: so that all that saw him concluded
infallibly that he would dye. In the last six Months, he had a very great pain
seized upon him on his left side, so as he could very difficultly Breath;
moreover, feeling upon the side, a Tumor of the Spleen might easily be
perceived; what with the violence of this pain and Tumor of the Spleen, and
what with the vehement pain of the Head, he fell into an extreme Ephidrosis or
sweating; so that Life was indeed despaired of.

3. He had been in many Physicians Hands, from whom he received, as he thought,
a Cart-load of Medicines, but without doubt it was a great deal: His last
Physician had taken away from him, at four several times, threescore ounces of
Blood, and had made him two Issues, the one in his right Arm, and the other in
his right Leg; but these were after he had applied the Secateum or Seton, and
had worn it in the Nape of his Neck, for more than five Weeks; He gave him
several Cordials, Potions, Julebs; together with manifold Opiates, which last
was indeed the true Cause of that vehement Ephidrosis or Sweating: but the
Opiate he pretended, was designed against that pricking pain of his side;
however, it introduced a Tabes or universal Consumption, over his whole Body,
which made the bystanders despair of Life.

4. But of what danger Opiates are, if unwarily given, or if not well prepared,
especially in persons either in, or inclinable to a Consumption, we have
already declared, in Our Synopsis Medicinae, Lib. 3. Cap. 30. Sect. 7. 3. Where
you have these Words. But you must be very cautious of Opiates, and totally
forbear them, if the sick be but inclinable to sweating, least they produce an
incurable Diaphoresis, which may bring the sick many Weeks or Months to his
Grave sooner than otherwise he would: and in sect. 21. 11. of the same Chapter:
If there be a great Colliquation by frequent and much sweating, the sick is in
great danger, and seldom recovers; this is often caused by unskillful giving of
Opiates and Narcoticks. Also in Lib. 3. Cap. 33. Sect. 14. 11* You have these
Words: But this you are to Note, That you be cautious of giving Opiates, at the
Mouth, least, you provoke an incurable Diaphoresis or Sweating, which
infallibly and speedily brings the sick to his Grave. These things I thought
good here to Remark, against the Vanity of such, who promiscuously give
Opiates, to all sorts of persons, and in all Cases, without any consideration
of the Cause, or danger of the Disease.

5. The Case of our Patient here, was truly desperate, there was (besides the
pain in his Head) a Catarrh, and Obstructions of the Lungs (for he could not
speak loud:) an Obstruction of the Spleen, (for he was mightily pained
thereabouts) a Scirrhus of the Spleen begun, (for a small Tumor might be
outwardly felt, but not painful;) a violent Diaphoresis, (for he Sweat almost
night and day:) and lastly, an apparert Tabes or universal pining and
Consumption of the whole body; (which was manifest by his extenuated habit;) so
that his Sickness seemed to be a great complication of Diseases.

6. In order to the Cure, I considered the most dangerous Symptom, which I
concluded to be the violent Diaphoresis, and that all care imaginable might be
taken for the stopping thereof; and my reason was, that whatever was done in
repect to any thing else, if that was not taken away, the sick must
unavoidably, and that suddenly too, dye. I ordered therefore his Body to be
gently purged, and that with Senna, Cassia, and such like gentle things,
because Purges naturally call the Humors now in Flux inward, and so make a
Revulsion.

7. But that this Revulsion might be made profitable to other ends, as well as
that of the Diaphoresis only; we ordered this of Riverius, which not only keeps
the body soluble, and stops the Diaphoresis, but is also of great power to take
away the Scirrhus of the Spleen. Take Ammoniacum, Opoponax, Bdellium, of each
two Drams, dissolve in white Wine, strain and boil; then add Confectio Hamech
Diaphoenicon, Pilulae Faetidae, of each two Drams: double Catholicon, ha^f an
Ounce, Mercurius Dulcis, four Scruples: mix for four Doses. Also I ordered a
strong Decoction of Juniper Berries* Take Canary, two Quarts: Juniper Berries
(well beaten, so that the grains within may be broken) six Ounces: b^yl them in
the Wine, in a thin linen Bag, till it comes to three pints, then strain and
keep it in Bottles for use. Of this I prescribed a Pint or more in a day, to be
taken in the morning fasting, just before Dinner, and last at Night going to
Bed, and to be made as tart as he could drink it with Oil of Sulphur, because
that such acid things not only cool the whole mass of Blood, but also bind up
the Pores of the Body: by this means in about ten days time his sweating was
overcome, but he had a weakness of the Bowels, and a kind of looseness, which
after a while I removed, with the Tragea Hepatica of Quercetan, which see in my
Pharm. Lib. 4. Cap. 21. Sect 78.

8. Now, that the Obstruction of the Lungs might be removed, instead of the Oil
of Sulphur I prescribed the Spirit of Sal Armoniack to be given in the
aforesaid Decoction to 8 drops, whose use, as also the use of the Decoction of
Juniper I advised to be drank through the whole Cure. for that we know by our
own Experience, That by the sole Use of that Decoction, we have cured several
hard Tumors of the Spleen, after they have been given-over by other Physicians
as uncurable; as in their proper place we shall show: also we ordered the
aforesaid composition of Riverius to be taken once a week continually, till
health was recovered.

9. But now and then, that the sick might not be wearied out, with always
taking the same thing, I caused the aforesaid Decoction to cease for 2 or 3
days; and gave in the Interval this following: Take decoctum pectorale, a
quart: Oil of Tartar per deliquium, an ounce: Spirit of Sal Armoniack, one
dram: Tincture of Spanish Juice of Liquorice in spirit of Wine, three ounces:
mix for a Potion. Of this he drank 3 or 4 Spoonfuls about 4 times in a day, by
means of which, the Obstruction of the Lungs was removed, and the Sick came to
his voice again, and breathed well: also the Catarrh insensibly went away.

10. The pain of the head by this time much declined, yet was not wholly
removed, so that it was necessary to apply our thoughts a little to that. I
ordered him to snuff up the Nostrills the powers of Sassafras; and to bathe the
place afflicted with the same: this he did often, by which his head was opened
and gently purged, and warmed, and the pain after a miraculous manner went
away, such are the Virtues of this Preparation of Sassafras; that they are
wonderful in this kind.

11. Outwardly to the Region of the Spleen I applied this Ointment. Take
Ammoniacum strained, one ounce, Balsam of Peru, Labdanum, of each half an
ounce: Hens-grease, two ounces: Oils of Roses and Melilot, of each three
ounces: juice of Hemlock, six ounces: boil to the consumption of the juices.
With this I anointed, after which I laid over it Ceratum de Ammoniaco Foresti:
by which means the Scirrhus of the Spleen diminished daily and went away. If
this Cerate could not have been had, I might have applied the Emplastrum de
Galbano Crocatum Mynsichti, Or, Emplastrum e Cicuta cum Ammoniaco, which you
may see in my Dispensatory: or, Labdanum with natural Balsam and Wax: Or that
Cerate mentioned in Our Synopsis Medicinae, lib. 3. cap. 31. Sect. 47. 3. at
the end thereof.

12. During all this time, the Tabes or Consumption was not forgot, for things
both as to Diet and Medicine were provided. For Diet I advised to things light
of Digestion, but forbad all Milk-meats, least they should be curdled by the
Acids which were prescribed for the removal of other Symptoms. The gravy and
juyces of meat, whether Beef, Mutton, Veal or Lamb, not much above half boiled
or roasted, then cut and slashed that the Juice might drop forth, he took
plentifully, with a drop or two of oil of Sulphur in it: but Gellies I forbad,
by reason of their Glutinous property. As to Medicine, the only thing he took,
was Electuarium ad Tabidos, which you may see in my Doron Medicum, lib. 2. cap.
22. Sect. 1. A most admirable thing in this Case, and by which I have restored
many Consumptive: but this thing was not administered till all the former things
in their order, had in some measure taken place, which was almost at a months
end: but whereas the sick had at first upon him a vehement sweating, and that
this Medicine if given in a large dose, does also provoke Sweat: I ordered the
dose in a less proportion, so as it might comfort and restore, but not provoke
the Diaphoresis. By these means continued* the sick was in about twelve weeks
time restored to his perfect he^lth.

The Chapter of the Megrim continued. Numb. 7. August 18.

X. A Megrim which proved Mortal, from a Sphacelation of the Brain.

1. It happened in a youth of about 17 years of Age, sanguin, and of a robust
and strong Body: it began at the latter end of July or beginning of August, and
had continued about 15 days without any Interm ssion; but sometimes there was
a kind of remission of the Vehemence of the pain, for some few hours.

2. He took little or no rest during all that time, and when upon any remission
of the pain, he had any sleep, it was troublesome and terrible, waking often in
much fear, terror and affrightment, so that there seemed to be sometimes an
Alienation of the Mind.

3. It was contracted at first by being in the Sun long, in an extreme hot day:
the youth having also surfeited himself by too much Eating, and too plentifully
drinking of Wine the day before: yet it began without a Fever, and so
continued to the seventh day, at which time the pain raging more than before,
excited a violent continual burning Fever, which we call Causos; for it was
extreme every third day.

4. Many things were done in order to his Cure, but without Success, for the
Disease resisted all Medicines: he was plentifully let blood; had Medicines
given him internally, and Topics applied outwardly; pickled Herrings applied
to the Soles of his Feet: at last, other things not prevailing, his Physician
gave him an Opiate; this did him no good, but made him absolutely rave.

5. His Case being desperate, it was moved by some of the Family, That I should
be sent for. When I came, I viewed the Youth, but with amazement, saw him very
dangerous, which at first put me to a stand what to do: I feared a Sphacelation
of the brain, at least an Inflammation thereof.

6. Now a Sphacelation of the Brain, is a Suppuration or Corruption of the
substance of the Brain, springing first from an Inflammation of the same: by
some it is called Gangreen, by others Mortification: it is treated of but by
few Authors: yet Hippocrates, lib. 3. de Morbis, has described it.

7. The Cause of it is Inflammation of the part: now the Cause of the
Inflammation is from Blood too much heated, whereby it becoms too fluxil, and
sheds it self into the inner part of the Brain: the cause of the Blood being
too much heated, may be from being too long in the heat of the Sun, or too
Violent exercise; or by holding the Head too near the Fire: whether on the
Hearth, or in the Oven, Furnace, etc. Or from a Contusion of the Head, or from
a Wound; or from Commotion of the Brain, by a Fall, Blow, etc:

8. An Apostem, Mortification, or Sphacelus of the Brain, is known by a great
Headache, running by the hinder part of the Head to the Neck and Back, with a
decay of all the Senses, both external and internal: he tosses too and fro,
cannot abide in the same place, lays hold with his hands upon his Head, pulls
his Hair, scratches his Face, as long as his strength will continue to do it:
there is a most sharp and strong Fever, which from third day to third day is
exasperated, nor will the sick either eat or drink, by which the strength soon
decays: all these signs were found in this our Patient. But had it proceeded
from a Wound or Contusion, there would be a kind of sadness and numbness in the
Body, with weakness of the Animal Spirits; and as the Disease increases, the
matter begins to putrify, a Fever arises, from whence comes Headache and
sluggishness: as the putrefaction increases, all the Symptoms grow more
vehement, the Fever sharper; the sick rises from his sleep of a sudden, and
roars out, presently lying down again, often putting his hand to his Head,
there sometimes coming forth, from the Mouth and Nose (a little before Death) a
filthy, green and stinking matter.

9. This Disease is for the most part Mortal, and as Hippocrates says, Sect. 7
Aph. 51. in three days time. They (says he) who have a mortified and putrified
Brain, dye in three days, but if they live longer, they recover. But this is
not to be understood of a complete Sphacelus or Mortification of the Brain, for
that is incurable; but of that which is at hand by reason of great Inflammation
thereof. See my Synopsis Medicinae lib. 1. cap. 52. sect. 28. and lib. 2. cap.
39. sect. 28. where you may receive much satisfaction. Now here is to be noted,
That such as recover of this Disease, remember nothing past, no not their
Disease, or any thing relating to it.

10. As to the Cure, Authors order a plentiful letting of Blood, and often, as
3 or 4 times the same day; therein placing the only hope of Remedy, because a
great quantity of Blood possesses the soft and moist substance of the Brain,
and no other revulsion can be made so great as by Blood-letting, even to the
drawing out of almost all the Blood in the Veins: and here the saying of
Prudent Celsus may be noted, That it is better to experiment a doubtful Remedy,
than to leave the Sick to apparent and certain danger; and that many things are
rightly done in time of eminent danger, which otherwise ought to be omitted.
Sharp Clysters may also be given every day, to bring the humors downwards; also
Cupping-glasses may be applied with deep Scarrification to the Shoulders and
Back; Frictions and Ligatures to the extreme parts, Vesicatories to the Neck
and Arms: The Saphena in the Legs may be opened, then the Forehead Veins, after
the Arteries in the Temples; next the Vein at the tip of the Nose, lastly, set
Horse-Leeches behind the Ears. See my Synopsis Medicinae, lib. 3. cap. 29.
sect. 28. The rest of the Cure you may find where we treat of a Frenzy. Lastly,
if you find the Disease decline, you may gently resolve by applying Bread hot
out of the Oven.

11. As to my Patient, I very much feared his Death, and that there was a real
Sphacelation of the Brain: His Parents urged me to do something; Blood-letting
and other things for revulsion were done before sufficiently, so that they need
not to be repeated: at the request of his Friends, I gave him, though
unwillingly, a Dose of the Lunar Pills, and ordered Tincture of Luna, and Oil
of Sulphur to be given in all his Drink: but alas! early the next morning, the
Youth had surrendered his Vital Breath: His Head was afterward opened, and the
Brain on the right side (which was the side on which the pain was) was
perfectly Sphacelated or mortified, which was the true Cause of his Death.

XI. A Megrim proceeding from a Cold taken.

1. A laboring Woman of about 36 years of Age, having taken a great cold, was
extremely perplexed with a violent pain in her head on the left side, so that
at first it even distracted her.

2. It had been but of 3 weeks continuance, but very extreme: my Counsel was
desired therein: I gave her half a dram of Pilulae ex duobus (for she was of a
strong body:) it wrought very well, and gave her 12 Stools. Three days
following I Sweat her with 15 grains of Bezoar mineral mixed with half a Dram
of Mithridate; giving her after it this, Take Aqua Vitae Matthioli (that is
Aqua Coelestis) one ounce, Syrupus Bizantinus compound, one ounce and half:
Camomil water three ounces, mix them. This made her Sweat for 10 or 12 hours
powerfully; and upon the fourth day following, it was repeated again.

3. Outwardly, I caused her head to be bathed 4 or 5 times a day with the
Quintessence or Powers of Sassafras, and to snuff the same up her Nostrills,
then her head to be bound up; so was she in 8 days time perfectly cured. All
the Drink she took during this time was almost boiling hot, or as hot as she
could endure it.

XII. A Megrim with the Cramp in many parts of the body.

1. The Sick in Winter time, had been 4 days troubled with this Megrim, which
seemed to arise from a cold taken, and a disaffection of the Stomach; for he
had not only the Cramp seized him in his Arms, Thighs and Calves of his Legs,
which came from sitting down upon the Snow; but he had also Convulsions of the
Stomach, and violent reachings to Vomit, which much excited the Pain of his
head.

2. Inwardly, I prescribed this. Take Powers of Sassafras six ounces, Saffron 2
Drams: Cochenele in powder one dram: Infuse three days: of this I ordered him
to take half a spoonful at a time or somewhat more in a little Glass of Canary,
and this to be done 3 or 4 times a day: This wonderfully comforted and healed
his Stomach; it cheared his heart also; and mightily revived his Spirits; and
by a specific property gave ease, not only to the pain of the Head, but to all
the Convulsive parts, in like manner; for in this Case, there is scarcely the
like Medicament in the whole republic of Medicine.

3. Outwardly, I caused the Head, Nostrils, and all places where the Cramp had
seized, to be well bathed twice a day, viz. morning and night with the Powers
of Amber; these mightily resolved and discussed the matter of the Cause, and
also nourished and cherished the native heat which seemed to be hurt. But the
Head I caused to be bathed with the said Powers three or four times a day, and
so to be bound up. By the use of these remedies, the sick was freed from all
his Grief in about ten days time.

XIII. A Megrim in a woman, which had lately been delivered.

1. It was upon the right side of her Head, by reason of taking cold, from a
Casement being left open, the Wind blowing upon her, as she lay in her Bed.

2. She had been delivered about sixteen days before, and was well cleansed, so
that no fault could arise from thence: nor indeed was there any thing more or
less, than the alteration of the Temperament of the part.

3. The pain was vehement upon her by fits, but the fit would sometimes last
eight or ten hours upon her, and increased so vehemently, as to cause an
alienation of mind; but when the extremity was off from her, she was never
absolutely freed from it, but only a kind of remission.

4. It had now been upon her 8 days: she sends for me, and desired my
Assistance, relating to me what past, whereby I apparently saw, that the pain
arose not from matter abounding, nor from blood over heated, but only from a
simple intemperature of Cold, for the side where the pain was was always cold,
and in the time of the fit extreme cold, as if it was numbed.

5. From hence I concluded, That if I could but thoroughly warm the part, I
should remove the pain: hereupon I caused the head to be well anointed with
oil of Sassafras, then hot bread out of the oven to be laid to, and to be
repeated for 2 or 3 times, this did her good, and gave her ease: after the
bread had been thrice applied, I ordered her head to be anointed morning and
night with Oil of Sassafras, and so a flannel to be laid-over it, and to be
bound up; as also to anoint the inside of her Nostrils, and this to be
continued for so long time, till she felt her self wholly freed from her pain,
which was in about 14 days time.

6. However during all this while, that we might be sure to strengthen the
Brain also, with the parts adjacent, I ordered her to take the Powers of
Sassafras half a Spoonful at a time morning and night in a Glass of Canary, by
all which means the Cure was perfected.

Observations out of other Authors.
XIV. An old Megrim cured by opening an Artery.

1. In the Hemicrania, when one half of the Head is pained from an hot cause,
in that kind of pain which Gordonius calls Clavus or the Nail, which is a pain
fixed in the Temples, the opening of an Artery does wonderfully help, which I
have safely performed in many.

2. I bound down the Orifice with a single bolster made of a double clout, and
wet in cold water, as in the ordinary opening of a Vein, which I bound with
such a bandage as Gallen calls the Hare without Ears, and the blood never
breaks forth afterward.

3. Also I have seen a tedious Cephalea or old universal Headache cured in the
Hospital by applying a potential Cautery unto the Temporal Artery. For the
Eschar being come away, which was caused by the Potential Caustic, applied
upon the Veins and Arteries, no flux of Blood follows, because industrious
nature, while she endeavors to separate the Eschar, does without breed new
flesh, wherewith the mouths of the Vessels are closed up.

4. Now whereas it may be objected, That great bleedings in wounds which are
stopped by actual Cauteries, are often times renewed when the Eschar falls away: I
answer, That th^se Eschars are thinner, and so fall away sooner, and therefore
there is not in the mean space, so much time as may breed new flesh. But such
Eschars as are made by Potential Cauteries, are more thick and solid and are
long before they come away; so that there is time enough for new flesh to
breed, and stop up the hole. River. Obs. 446.

XV. A Megrim with a Catarrh, the Council of Fernelius.

1. As far as I can gather by your Letters, those Pituitous Swellings, which
now for these many years have been upon your Face* and Cheeks, arise from a
Distillation from the top of your Head, into the said parts: and because the
Catarrh falls so frequently into the same place, it may be feared the place it
self has some weakness in it, which moves the Fluxion to it: but from thence no
certainty can be learned, unless the seat and kind of the Disease be first
perfectly understood.

2. Now that Megrim, touching which your last Letter desires advice, is a
distinct and different Disease, which exacts a peculiar method of Cure. For the
immediate Cause thereof is a Vapor, which arising from Choler flowing out of
the Liver into the Stomach, does smite and twitch the Membranes of the Brain,
yielding matter peradventure to the distillation.

3. That same Distillation with which, by its so often returning, you are so
vehemently troubled, must be removed with one Dram of Pilulae sine quibus
(which are most proper, both for your Age and temperament) especially if for
eight or ten days last past, you have taken no Medicine against the Catarrh:
The next day after, baggs as hot as can be endured, must be applied to the
Crown of your Head, being first shaved, morning and evening before Supper; for
that these may draw the matter out thence, from most parts, and resolve the
same; and they must abide on for the space of half an hour, or thereabouts, and
be continued for certain days, till the fluxion be stopped.

4. Moreover an Astringent Plaster to stop the passages must be applied to the
Temples, to those parts through which the humors go, and it must be renewed
every other day, and not be disused till the fluxion cease.

5. If the Humor shall no longer run down by the Mouth and Cheek-bone; that the
Gums and inner parts of the Mouth may not so easily receive the fluxil Humor,
let them be washed three or four times a day, with an astringent Gargarism.
Take Sage one handful: Mastich bruised, half a Dram: Hartshorn, three drams:
boil them in Wine and Water, of each a sufficient quantity; then strain it out.
With this wash your Mouth and Gums 3 or 4 times a day. And because all the
matter of the Catarrh is not very soon dried up, some part of the Gargarism
must be injected by little and little through the Nostrils and Mouth, morning
and evening before Supper, that thereby, the Cavity of the Brain may be purged.

6. Keep in the mean season a fit diet, live sparingly, eat meats of good
juice, and drink thin Wine, very well allayed with Water, partly because of the
cold distemper of your Brain, and partly because of the hot Distemper of your
Liver; keep your self from immoderate drinking, eating Broths, and other moist
meats, also from wind, cold, and rain: use moderate exercise in the morning
before Dinner; at going to Bed, let your Arms, Back, Thighs and Legs, be
rubbed downwards: keep your Belly always soluble, either by Nature or by
Artificial means, as suppositories or Clysters (which Clyster may be the
ordinary Clyster;) lest your body abound with Excrements.

7. Often take this following Purge: Take Pilulae sine quibus, two Scruples:
Pills of Agrick, one Scruple: make them into a Mass with Syrup of Stoechas, and
form seven Pills [of which you may give three overnight, and four the next
morning.

8. The Bags (which are usual) mentioned at 3 aforegoing. Take Anniseeds,
Fennel-seeds, Bay Berries bruised, of each two Drams: Millet half a pound:
common Salt six drams: apply them all to the Crown of the Head. The Astringent
Plaster, mentioned at 4. above: Take Vnguentum desicativum Rubrum, half a Dram:
Mastick poudred, one Dram, make them into a Plaster, and apply it to the Temple
of the pained side.

XVI. An Inveterate Megrim cured by a Flux of Blood by the Bowels.

1. One Girardus was troubled with a most vehement and inveterate Megrim, to
whom many and various things were prescribed, both internal and external.

2. The Temporal Arteries were opened, and the Seton was applied to the Nape of
the Neck, which mitigated the pain but little.

3. At length, when nothing more seemed to be don, but all hopes were past,
Nature put her self forth and expelled by stooll a large quantity of a dust and
black coagulated blood: in one night about four pounds weight, by which his
Megrim was very much abated.

4. Now his Forces being mightily weakened by the same, yet they were easily
restored, by giving Cinnamon Water with Confectio Alkermes, and some other
Cordials.

5. About three weeks after, he had another flux of blood again, and at the
same time of the Night, wherein he cast forth by stool, about five pounds of
Blood: lastly about two days after he ejected a pound and half more.

6. During the Intervals of these fluxes, it was Our business to conserve and
restore the strength of the body, by a good Diet, and exhibition of
Corroboratives, with proper Epithems, by which at length the pain ceased, and a
little time after he recovered his Health.

7. This flux of blood may be thought to proceed from the Spleen, because that
for many years before, he labored under a hardness and Scirrhus of the Spleen;
the blood also was black which sufficiently denoted it; and the Spleen also has
its first influx into the Ventricle, which does appear, because always before
the excretion of this a dust and coagulated blood, for a whole day or longer,
he complained of loathing, and a great weight at the bottom of his stomach,
with the feeling of much pain. Hildanus, Cent. 2. Obs. 9.

XVII. Another Inveterate Megrim.

1. A Noble Matron was trouble^ with a long and sharp pain in the left side of
her Head, which in a cold and moist time was most vexatious to her. Many and
various Medicines were exhibited, both internal and external, by the
Praescription of Physicians, but all in vain.

2. At length I was called, and having diligently enquired into the Cause of
the Disease, found that about 4 years and an half before, she had been
afflicted with a most vehement pain of the Teeth, on the left side of the Jaw,
which ceasing, this pain on the same side of the head was left remaining; from
hence I concluded this pain to arise from the roots of corrupt and rotten
Teeth; inspecting the Mouth, I found the roots of four rotten Teeth in the
upper Jaw.

3. I persuaded her to have those rotten roots of Teeth drawn forth, which
being willing to, she promised: but I prescribed to her a fit Diet; and purged
her with this following Medicament. Take roots of Parsley, Fennel, and Pollipody
of the Oak, of each half an ounce: Flowers and Leaves of Betony, Leaves of
Agrimony, Veronica, Dodder, of each half a handful: Bugloss and Rosemary
Flowers, Tops of Marjoram, of each a pugil (or little handful:) Seeds of Annise
and Fennel, of each two Drams: Sena cleansed, half an ounce: boil all in Water,
to the Consumption of a third part: strain, and in four ounces of straining,
macerate and infuse; choice Rubarb, two drams: Agarick newly Trochiscated,
Cinnamon, Ginger, of each one dram: strain by pressing hard out, and dissolve
therein Benedictae Laxativae, two drams: make a Potion.

4. The next day, Cupping-Glasses being applied to her Shoulders and nape of
her Neck, she was eased: Afterward, I prescribed this following Apozem. Take
roots of Succory, Fennel, Parsley, Grass, Pollopody of the Oak, of each one
ounce: Flowers and Leaves of Betony, Leaves of Veronica, Dodder, Scabious, of
each one handful^: Flowers of Bugloss, Rosemary, Tops of Marjoram, Time, of
each two Pugils: Seeds of Annis, Fennel, of each half a dram: Liquorice scraped
or rasped, raisons stoned, of each an ounce: boil them in pure water, and
strain out: in a pound and half of the straining, infuse and digest Sena
cleansed, two ounces: choice Rhubarb, half an ounce: Agarick newly
Trochiscated, two drams: Cinnamon and Ginger, of each one dram: Infuse for a
Night, and strain out by pressing strongly. To the Colature or straining, add
Syrup of Roses solutive, compounded with Rhubarb, Agarick and Sena, three
ounces: Syrup of Betony, two ounces: mix them, and make an Apozem for four
Doses, to be taken in the morning fasting.

5. The Apozem being all taken, in the morning, while her stomach was empty, I
drew forth her rotten teeth. The day following I gave her these Pills: Take
Pilulae aureae, Cochiae, Agregativae, of each a Scruple: Diagredium, Troches
Alhandal, of each four Grains: with Syrup of Betony make five Pills, which roll
in powder of Cinnamon.

6. At last, for some few days, twice a day, I adhibited this following
Fomentation. Take flowers and leaves of Betony, Flowers of Rosemary, of
Camomil, of red Roses, of Staechas: tops of Marjoram and Wormwood, of each half
a handful: Aniseed, Wood of Guajacum finely rasped, of each an ounce: cut and
bruise them and put them into a bag, big enough to cover the whole part pained,
boil it in red Wine, and apply it hot. By the use of these things, through the
Divine help, she was perfectly made well. Hildanus, Cent. 2. Obs. 10.

XVIII. Another Megrim cured by opening an Artery.

1. A Megrim caused from Blood too hot, thin and vapourous, and not to be
overcome by any remedies, is cured by opening of the Temporal Arteries, whether
it be within or without the Scull; for thereby there is a certain evacuation of
the conjoined matter, of blood and Spirits.

2. This I have often experienced, but specially in the Prince a Rupe
Surionensi, to whom many great Physicians, as Chaplain, the Kings Physician,
and Castellain, the Queens chief Physician, and Lewis Duret, who
notwithstanding could help him nothing, by Blood-letting, Cupping, Baths,
Frictions, Diet, or any other kind of Remedy, whether inwardly taken, or
outwardly applied,

3. I being called, said, that there was only hope one way to recover his
Health, which was to open the Artery of the Temple, on the same side that the
pain was, for I thought it probable, that the Cause of his pain was not
contained in the Veins, but in the Arteries; in which case, by the Testimony of
the Ancients, there was nothing better, than the opening or bleeding of an
Artery, whereof I have made trial upon my self, to my great good.

4. When as the Physicians had approved of this my Advice, I presently betake
my self to the Work, and choose out the Artery in the pained Temple, which was
both the more swollen, and beat more vehemently than the rest: I opened this, as
we used to do in the bleeding of a Vein, with one incision, and took more than
two Porringers of Blood, flying out with great violence and leaping: the pain
presently ceased, neither did it ever molest him again.

5. Yet this opening of an Artery is suspected by many, for that it is
troublesome to stay the gushing forth of the Blood, and cicatrize the place, by
reason of the density, hardness, and continual pulsation of the Artery: and
lastly, for that when it is cicatrized, there may be danger of an Aneurisma.

6. Wherefore they think it better to divide the Skin than to separate the
Artery from all the adjacent Particles, and then to bind it in two places, and
then to divide it, as we have formerly told you, must be done in varices.

7. But this is the Opinion of men, who fear all things where there is no
cause; for I have learned by frequent Experience, that the apertion of an
Artery; which is performed with a Lancet, as we do in opening a Vein, is not at
all dangerous: and though the consolidation or healing thereof is somewhat
slower than in a vein, yet will it be done at length, and so that no flux of
Blood will happen, if so be that the Ligation be fitly performed, and remain so
for four days with fitting Pledgets, Paraeus, Lib. 17. Cap. 4.

XIX. A Megrim returning in the Winter time.

1. A certain person of middle Age, black Hair, and of melancholy complexion,
Anno 1584. near Winter, was vexed with a pain in the right side of his Head,
which seized him sometimes at two or three of the Clock in the Night, and
sometimes at five or six in the morning, when he awaked from sleep, vexing him
for three or four hours. Thus it continued by intervals, and returned for the
space of five Weeks.

2. This pain after certain purgations were used (but no Blood-letting) was
sensibly abated: but the following year, viz. 1585, toward Winter it began to
afflict him again on the same side, and continued upon him, till I cured it, as
in the former year.

3. Anno 1586. about the beginning of November, this Megrim invaded the same
side of his Head again, with much more vehemence, together with a pain of the
Teeth of the same side. With these two pains together, he was miserably
Afflicted, and although various Medicines were adhibited, the pain
notwithstanding was not diminished but increased,

4. When Pills fitted for the Head were used by a Council of Physicians, the
disease yet grew stronger, and returned with such Violence, as almost to make
the sick mad; the pain chiefly being from the Crown of the Head, falling to the
Temples, it was so great, that it even pained his Teeth, and although it was as
it were immense, yet it was a dull and obscure pain.

5. For Diversion sake, his feet were wont to be washed: to his head many
Anodyn things were applied, and various Electuaries and powders were taken to
strengthen it. When watchfullness troubled him, he took a somniferous potion;
and for his weakness, things restoring: But notwithstanding these things were
continued, and although the pain did sometimes remit, he always felt the said
right side of his head to be cold; for which the Physicians proposed a dry bath
to be used for 3 days, that the side of the Head growing hot, it might
extremely sweat; he consenting, sweat with the same, and began to be better,
his pain sensibly abating, till he was able to go abroad in public.

6. But not long after his pain returned again with much more violence, by
which he found himself, as it were over come; and its seat was chiefly on the
right side of the head, where the naked bones and void of flesh stick out, as
in the seat of the Crown in the extention of the forehead bone, in the
Yoak-bone, from the Cheek to the Ear, even to the lower Jaw, chiefly there
where it sticks out near the neck, in which places he was mightily tormented,
so that he could not without difficulty and much labor speak, nor was he able
to hear others speak without pain; he was miserably tormented, and restless:
which way soever he turned his head, he found no rest or ease; his whole body
trembled, and often tears fell from his Eyes, so that it made the Bystanders
to weep.

7. At length my Counsel was desired, and coming to him, I ordered a Lixivium
made after the ordinary way, by passing water through Ashes to be prepared: and
therein Sage, Rosemary, Marjoram, Rue, Bawm, Cammomil-flowers, Elder,
Red-Roses, Bay Berries, and Anniseeds, to be boiled, adding also thereto a
glass of wine: and with this all the pained places to be fomented, by dipping a
sponge therein, and a little expressing it with your hand, and then applying it
as hot as he could well endure it: and with the sponge also to bath it from the
upper parts downwards: which when it was done daily twice a day before eating,
he found the Extremity of his pain to be mitigated.

8. But the Pain not being perfectly gone, but sometimes returning again, I
persuaded him to apply Vigoes Emplaster spread upon Leather, to the whole place
where the pain was, viz. from the Crown of the head (the hair being first
shaved off) to the lower Jaw: the Emplaster being applied, about two hours
before Supper, he sat down at the Table, at which time such a noise was found
to be made in his head as if much water should fall out of one Vessel drop by
drop into another placed under it; and the noise was so great, that he did not
only perceive it himself, but they also which were near him heard it. This
noise in his head continued for two nights and one day: One night when he
slept, he was much comforted, but with the great noise he was awaked out of his
sleep, mightily afrighted, cried out aloud, and thought the house to be
falling, cast himself upon the floor, and hid himself under the Bed. This noise
presently ceasing, he had a pain extending from the Jaw Bone under the Eye to
the Ear, as if worms had been gnawing the place, which pain continuing for some
days and nights.

9. For this cause sake he began again to use the former Fomentation, the
plaster being taken away, which where it cleaved to the skin, was always wet,
as if it had been sprinkled with drops of water: and again, after the said
Fomentation was adhibited, he used it day and night, till the pain remitting,
from day to day, it was at last perfectly taken away, and the Sick was restored
to his prestine Health, which for a long time he perfectly enjoyed, except some
small Symptoms which he felt, upon any approaching cold, or when his head was
too much troubled with Studies and Cares. Plateri. Obs. lib. 2.

XX. A Megrim with Pain of the Eyes, and Inflammation of the Eyelids.

1. One as it was thought from drinking Wine too plentifully, was seized with a
vehement pain on the right side of the head, which pain raged about Noon-time,
but was a little mittigated near Night; and sometimes it would wholly remit.

2. There was also an intense pain of the right Eye; the whole white of the Eye
was red, the Veins turgid or swelled, (as if it had been covered with a red
fleshy Pellicule or Skin,) as also both Eye lids both within and without; the
Pupilla was obfuscated or clouded so, That although he could see the Light, yet
he was not able to discern things: This Distemper had now troubled him for
seven weeks.

3. Being called to him the 9 day of September Anno 1597. I exhibited one Dram
of my Purge prepared with Quinces, which gave him two Stools. I applied a
Cautery to the Nape of his Neck; but when because of his Age it did nothing; at
Night I adhibited a Vesicatory made of bruised Flammula or Spearwort, (a kind
of Ranunculus or Crow-foot,) Blisters arose by the next morning, which being
opened, a yellowish Serum came forth; after which I applied upon them Colewort
leaves smeared with fresh Butter, and these often to be reiterated.

4. To the Eyes I applied a Collyrium of Pomgranate Peels, in this manner, you
may drop one or two drops of it into the greater corner of the eye, the head a
little inclining, after which the Eyelid being closed, you may apply a Sponge
to the same, dipped in the said Collyrium mixed with the Mucilage of Faenugreek
seed, being warm, and a little expressed with your hand, which renew two or
three times a day. [The Collyrium you may make by boiling the bruised Peels in
Wine, then straining, and mixing it with a sufficient quantity of Water, adding
to every quart two Scruples of Salt of Vitriol.]

5. To his right Temple apply Emplastrum ad Herniam, or the Plaster against
Ruptures: The following day he was again purged with my Electuarium Diapomorum.
Going away from him, I ordered him to go on, and after five days, that the
Hypochyma or Cataract might be discust, to apply Veal, or the Lungs of a Sheep
to the part; and from a Pigeons feather newly pulled off, to instill the Drops
of Blood at the end thereof into the eye.

6. An Electuary to strengthen the Brain. Take preserved Acorus, Conserves of
Marjoram, Rosemary-Flowers, Lavender, Roses and Flowers of Sage, of each equal
parts, mix them. After some days, whilst the redness is not yet perfectly taken
away, this Collyrium is to be used. Take white Troches of Rhasis, two Drams,
Rose Water, eight ounces: Strawberry water distilled with Goats milk and
Camphir, one ounce: Fennel water, half an ounce, mix them.

7. The Cautery which the Chyrurgian made in the Nape of his Neck for the
repairing of the Sight and stopping of the Fluxion, I caused to be healed up,
which had been long kept open, and that with good success. His Eye was freed
from the Tumor and redness; but he complained of the cloudiness of his Sight,
caused by the white spot upon the Pupilla; and although he could discern some
Light, he was not in the least able to distinguish things: I ordered him this;
Take Ox-Galls, Turpentine, Honey, Sulphur, Wine, of each a like quantity, mix
and Distill therefrom a water, which drop into the eyes. Plateri. Observe. lib.

XXI. A Megrim Cured, by opening an Artery in the Temples, that by all other
means was incurable.

1. Concerning the happy success of my Counsel in opening of Arteries, I need
not now write, let us come to the thing.

2. The sick laboring of an outrageous Megrim, I counseled to open an Artery
of the Temples, on the side affected; it was done, and immediately he became
well, and to this time, being many years since, the pain has not returned.

XXII. A Megrim Cured by washing in cold Water.

1. A certain man, who for more than forty years had been troubled with the
Megrim, having used many Remedies in vain, by the Council of a Physician, often
washed his Forehead with cold water, by which he became perfectly well; but the
matter being derived into the Oesophagus and there thickning, hindered his
swallowing.

2. For the Brain being cold and a principal Member, we are to be cautious of
very cold things, nor to use them but with the greatest judgment. And Topics
which repel, ought to be applied warm, where the matter is more cold and crude:
but cold where the matter is hot and choleric. Hollerij de Morbis internis

XXIII. A Megrim arising from Gluttony.

1. A young man-26 years old, in August 1548 was taken with a strong Megrim, he
lived in idleness, gave himself over to the pleasures of the Pallat; filled
himself with various sorts of drink, and delighted himself continually in
Feasting, thereby became obnoctious to a heaviness of his Head.

2. He first made use of an Empirical Physician, but receiving not his desired
Health, he at length called me. To whom his Belly being hard bound, I would
have caused a Clyster to be given him, which he refusing, I ordered a sharp
suppository, by which his Belly was made soluble.

3. Then I prescribed the following Decoction, to incide or cut the
contumacious matter. Take Betony, Marjoram, Staechas-flowers, Rosemary-flowers,
of each alike, make a Decoction with Water or Wine, which sweeten with Oxymel.

4. The Decoction being taken, we exhibited these Pills. Take Pilulae Aureae,
Pilulae Cochiae, of each half a Dram: Diagredium, three Grains (for he was of a
strong Body) make five Pills, with Betony water, to be taken after midnight, by
all which means the Belly was made Soluble.

5. Soon after, one or two days being between, when he was strengthened,
Cupping-Glasses were applied to the Shoulders with Scarification, which drew
much Blood: Then he took the following Decoction twice a day. Take green or
fresh Betony* Vervain, Bay or Violet leaves, of each a handful: flowers of both
sorts of Staechas, and of Camomil, of each half a handful: best Sena, one
ounce: Guajacum and its Bark rasped, an ounce and half: Damask Pruns, No. xv.
Raisons stoned, one ounce: Ani-seed and Fennel seed, of each a dram: boil all
in a sufficient quantity of Water, according to Art: with one pound of which,
mix syrup of Staechas, four ounces. By the taking of this, much pituitous
matter with a little choleric and melancholy Excrements were avoided three or
four times a day, by which he had some ease.

6. The place affected was anointed with this following Liniment. Take Ointment
of Alabaster, one ounce: Oil of Camomil, half an ounce: mix them. This he used
with Masticatories also, thus prepared: Take Pellitory of Spain, two scruples
and a half: Mastick, Cubebs, of each a scruple and a half: make them into a
powder, and form two Masticatories, by tying them up round with a thread in fine
Linen cloth, which every morning one after another, let be chewed in the mouth:
so will much pituitous matter be brought away. The Decoction being for a while
used, and the Unction aforesaid continued, he became cured of this his vehement
pain. Foresti. Lib. 9. Observe. 58.

XXIV. A Megrim proceeding from a cold Humor.

1. A Costard Monger was vehemently afflicted on the left side of his Head,
with a contumacious Megrim. The chief hope of his Cure, was in the concoction
of the Humor, and in proper purging.

2. For this purpose, I first prescribed this Apozem. Take roots of Asparagus,
Fennel, Parsley, Peony, of each half a dram: Hysop, Betony, Bay Leaves, Sage,
Marjoram, Calamint, of each one handful: Rosemary Flowers, Staechas, of each
one pugil: Peony seed, two Drams: Raisons stoned, one ounce: make a Decoction
in Rainwater: to one pint of the straining, add Oxymel simple, Syrups of
Staechas, and of Calaminth, of each one Ounce: mix and make an Apozem for four
doses.

3. This being taken, Take of the aforesaid Decoction, four Ounces: in which
Dissolve Diaphoenican, half an ounce: Electuarium Indum, one dram and half:
syrup of Staechas, Oxymel Scyllitick, of each half an ounce: mix them. This he
took in the morning.

4. This don, I ordered him to repeat the former Decoction, which being drank,
I prescribed these Pills to be taken after Midnight. Take Pilulae Cochiae,
Aggregativae, de Agarico, of each one scruple: Troches Alhandal, three grains:
make seven Pills: from which he had seven or more Stools.

5. At last he had the Decoction of Guajacum, adding capital Herbs: I ordered
the part affected to be anointed with Oils of Rue and Bays, mixed with the
Alabaster Ointment. All these things being accordingly used, the sick became
well. Foresti. Lib. 9 Obs. 59.

XXV. A Megrim from a hot Cause, with an Ophthalmia.

1. Jacob Purmeran labored under a Megrim, a hot and sharp Catarrh descending,
with an Ophthalmia, and great pain of his Eyes: things which were very cold
were applied by a Woman Emperick (before universals) both to the Head and Eyes,
whereby the Man almost 70 years old, was made blind, the pain continually
growing greater and greater, so that at length, upon the 17. day of May, I was
called to him.

2. His Belly was somewhat bound, therefore I prescribed the following Bolus.
Take Cassia new drawn, six drams: Cassia with Sena, two drams: Diacatholicon, a
dram and half: Fennel-seeds in powder, ten grains: make a Bolus, which sprinkle
with white Sugar Candy: this made him go well to stool.

3. The following day, in the place of Letting Blood, by reason of the man's
great Age, I would have applied Cupping Glasses with Scarrification; but he
refusing, I ordered him to Drink twice a day of this following Decoction. Take
of the Rinds of Succory roots, of Fennel, Liquorice scraped, of each half an
ounce; green Fumitory, two handfulls; Fennel, tops of Hops; Endive, Succory,
Borrage, Bugloss, Sorrel, of each a handful; Betony, half a handful; Fennel
seed, three drams; the four greater cold Seeds, of each half a dram; Damask
Prunes, fifteen; Tamarinds, half an ounce; Raisons stoned, one ounce; Jujubes,
Sebestens, of each five; make of all a Decoction in Whey: Strain it, and to a
pound and half thereof, add Syrup of Succory with Rhubarb, Syrups of Endive and
Fumitory, Oxysaccharum simplex, of each half an ounce: Aromatize it with
Species Diarrhodon abbatis first cleansed, adding Sugar to fit the Taste.

4. The Decoction being taken, I would willingly have given him Pills, but the
Old Man being very Morose, did of his own head, utterly refuse the same. Into
his Eye I instilled the Collyrium* made of the white Troches of Rhasis,
dissolved in Rose Water; afterward I used Woman's milk mixed with Fennel water.
And the part affected of the head, I anointed with Vnguentum Populeon;
afterward I added a very little of the Alabaster Ointment, with which the Pain
was somewhat abated, after which I was no longer retained in the cure.

5. But a few days being past, the Megrim returned, as also the pain of the Eye
became vehement; presently he sends for his Woman Empericks, by whom his Grief
was increased, though from them he expected his Health; whereupon he causes me
to come to him again, together with Alardus the Younger, a Physician lately
come out of Italy: he called us upon the ninth day of June.

6. For the Megrim, which now was without Inflammation, we used the Alabaster
Ointment, anointing the part of the Head afflicted: then we applied
Cupping-Glasses with scarification, (which he now consented to) by which the
pain was something eased.

7. In the mean season, by reason of the length of the Disease, and the
accession of much Phlegm in old age, we ordered him to take this Decoction. Take
Betony, Endive, Succory, Fennel, of each one handful: Sage, half a handful:
Flowers of Staechas of both kinds, Roses, of each one pugil: Fennel seed a dram
and half: boil all in Betony and Fennel Waters: To eight ounces of the
straining add syrups of Betony and of Staechas, of each an Ounce and half: mix,
well for two Doses. Then (being become willing to take Pills) we ordered him
these to be swallowed after midnight. Take Pilulae aureae, Cochiae, of each one
Scruple, with Fennel Water, make five Pills, which though slowly, gave him
three stools. But the Bowels were before irritated or moved with this
suppository. Take powder of Hiera Picra, a Scruple: Diagredium, Coloquintida in
fine powder, of each three grains: Honey one ounce: with a little Salt make a
Suppository. [But how I know not, unless it be put up the Fundament, by help of
a Pipe.]

8. After these things, we caused him to use Masticatories (but Errhins and
Sternutatories we used not, because of his Eyes.) Take Mastick, a dram: Cubebs
a scruple* Black Pepper, half a scruple: roots of Pellitory of Spain, and Bark
of Caper-roots, of each two scruples: powder them finely, and tie them up in
Linen with a thread, making three several Masticatories; which morning after
morning fasting chew for a quarter of an hour; so will much phlegm flow by the
Mouth.

9. In the mean while, immediately after purging, and the application of the
Cups, drop this following Collyrium into the Eye. Take Rose water distilled in
Balneo maris, two ounces: Woman's milk, one ounce: mix them. Take Aloes Epatica,
a Scruple: Gum Arabic, Tragacanth, Sarcocol, of each half a scruple: Tutia
prepared, Quince-seeds, Sumach, a little pulverized, of each half a Scruple:
these being bruised and tied up in a linen Rag, hang in the aforesaid Water
and Milk; which press letting the pressed-out Liquor distill into the Eye three
or four times a day: by these means he was at length restored to his Health.
Foresti. Lib. 9. Obs. 60.

XXVI: A Megrim which came once a Month.

1. A Woman aged 40 years, was once a month (but sometimes twice or thrice,)
much troubled with a pain on the right side of her head, which commonly ended
with a Vomiting, and in her Fit she could neither walk nor stand.

2. This Vomit was first exhibited. Take the Vomiting Infusion, one ounce; this
wrought six times: the next day she took these Pills. Take Pills of Amber, two
drams; Fernelius his Cephalic Pills* one dram; make fifteen Pills: She took
thre^ of them before Supper, every day till they were spent.

3. After them she took this Decoction. Take Sarsaparilla 4 ounces: water five
quarts: Infuse 24 hours, then slice, after boil to the Consumption of the half,
and strain it out: Dose a good draught morning and night when she went to Bed.

4. For ordinary Drink, she took the second Decoction of the same made in seven
quarts or more of Water, boiling it without Infusion, till a third part be
wasted. Cooks Observe. Cent. 1. Obs. 23.

XXVII. A periodick pain in the hinder part of the Head.

1. My Counsel was desired by an honest Matron, who was troubled with a tedious
and Periodical pain of the Head, which in every eight days vehemently molested
her: It lay in the hinder part of the Head, from the place where the Head is
joined to the Neck, reaching to the Crown, and it was as if it had been a
boring: it extended it self also to the Temples, but chiefly on the left side;
and to the left ear, being accompanied with a loathing and griping at stomach.

2. These Symptoms are to be reduced to their Causes; first, whether the Head
is affected from it self, or by consent of some other parts. In a tedious and
long continuing Disease, which affects by it self; there it chiefly arises,
from a thick, cold pituitous Humor. But by consent, in a loathing and pained
Stomach, where some sharp humor is gathered together, from thence vapors are
raised, which ascend into the Head, and there breeding a pituitous matter, hurt
the Nervous parts. Sometimes also, vapors are transmitted to the Head from the
Womb, and these chiefly molest the hinder part of the Head.

3. The Causes of the Periodick return, are either a Collection of matter, or
some external Cause which stirs and moves the matter, as bathing, covering of
the head, tedious exercise in reading, speaking, etc. abstinence from Food,
irregular Diet. But whatever the Cause may be, as in all Chronick and long
lasting Diseases, so chiefly in this; a good and regular Diet ought to be kept,
from which may proceed the least Phlegmatic matter, or other sharp and corrupt
humors.

4. Then to hinder the Collection of the matter, these following Pills are to
be taken every day. Take Aloes rosatae, a dram and half: the Species of the
Electuary de geminis, half a dram, and with Syrup of Roses Solutive, make
Pills, in number 42. Let 7 of them be taken about half an hour before Supper:
And twice a month let her take a dram at a time of Pilulae de Succino, after
her first Sleep. Take Powder of Amber, Mastich, of each two drams: Aloes, five
drams; Agarick a dram and half; true round Birthwort roots, half a dram; with
Syrup of the juice of Betony make a mass of Pills: in the use of which, let her
persist twice a month, as aforesaid.

5. But the Disease being Chronick, we must consider, That the Cure will be
long; and tha it must be taken away by little and little; which you will
perceive by the use of the former Pills.

6. And according to the Judgment of your Physician then present, you may loose
some Blood; and the whole Body may be well purged: Then for 15 days the
Decoction of Guajacum with Sarsa may be drank, with a good course of Diet. Take
Lignum Guajacum, a pound: Sarsa three ounces: Fountain water, six quarts; boil
them to the Consumption of the half.

7. The Head also by it self ought to be purged and strengthened: first with
this Apophlegmatism, thus made: Take Origanum, Marjoram, Rosemary, red Roses,
of each a Pugil: Ginger two Drams: Pellitory of Spain, three Drams: boil all in
a sufficient quantity of pure Water: strain, and to one pound thereof, add
Vinegar of Roses, two Ounces, which mix. Let this be used as a Gargarism in the
Morning. But the Decoction of Guajacum boiled with Marjoram, draws much by the
Nose.

8. Let the Feet be washed with a Decoction of Betony, early in the morning, at
which time also Frictions may be used to the Arms, Shoulders, and Back, when
the pain urges, apply Radishes cut small, to the hinder part of the Head: let
the Head also be sometimes washed a little before Supper, not after exposing it
to the Air; the Wash may be made of Rasped Guajacum boiled in Lie. That these
things may be happily accomplished, I pray the Almighty God. April 6. Anno

SCHOLIA.
By W. Salmon, the Author of this Work.
XXVIII. Of the principal Kinds of Diseases.

1. In regard that we shall Write a new Theory of Physic; it is to be
understood, that we shall not altogether follow the Conceptions of other Men,
any further than we Judge them to be followers of Nature, Right-Reason, and
Truth: Therefore we hope all the Lovers of Art will hold us Excused, if they
find some things in these Discourses not agreeable with their Apprehensions; for
since I Tread not in a beaten Tract, it may be supposed that many new things
may be met withal; which some out of a Capricious Humor of Carping against all
that is not of their own Complexion; may Condemn, and it may be, not for want
of the Knowledge of a Reason of the things herein contained, but only out of
Spite or Envy to the Author, which they may Broach under the pretense of
Novelty: But leaving those to their own Masters, or to Hugg and Embrace their
old Sentiments, for the most part more Venerable for their Antiquity than for
any Demonstration of Truth: We shall now come to a particular Explication of
our Intentions.

2. In order to unfold this our Theory; these general things following are
principally to be understood; 1. The Nature, or Kinds of Diseases in general,
which we make to be threefold, viz. Diseases of Intemperature, Diseases of
Repletion, and Diseases of Ablation.

3. Diseases of Intemperature are the most simple of those which befall Humane
Kind, which, what they are in special, shall in the Progress of this Work be
declared: However in general, those are called Diseases of Intemperature,
wherein heat, cold, dryness, and moisture, are either defective, or abundant,
under or above the equal or natural Disposition of those Qualities.

4. Diseases of Repletion are such, wherein various kinds of preternatural
Humors, and other Matters either thin and solid, abound above the equality or
design of Nature; as Water in a Dropsy, Rhume in a Catarrh, Chalk or Nodes in
the Gout, the Stone or Gravel in a Nephritis, Pus in an Apostume, with many
others of like kind, which in their places shall be Demonstrated.

5. Diseases of Ablation are such, wherein there is a deficiency of the Natural
Juyces, Humors, or parts of the Body; as of the Humidum Radicale in a Tabies,
of the Chylus Juice in a Atrophia, of the substance of the Lungs in an Ulcer
thereof, etc.

6. These are all the principal kinds of Diseases, from the Nature of which,
the general Indications of Cure are taken: For in the first, It is necessary
that we remove the Intemperature, which is all that is to be done, and that is
done by the Exhibition of Alteratives, as is seen in a simple Fever without
Putrefaction: In the second Case, That the preternatural Matter
super-abounding, be taken away, and this is done sometimes with Catharticks,
sometimes with Emeticks, sometimes with Diuretics, Sudorificks, Salivatiks,
Errhins, Sternutatories, and sometimes by Vesicatories, Issues, application of
the Seton, etc. In the third Case, that there be made a Reparation so far as is
possible of the Natural matter which is Defective: This is done by the
exhibition of great Openers, Attenuaters, Inciders, Analepticks, or
Restoratives, etc.

7. In order to the performance of these things, there is a necessity of the
Knowledge of the Disease, of the Cause, or Causes, and of the hope of Cure;
which we shall consider in the Pathology of each Disease in particular. Next of
the Therapia, or particular method of Curing, which Let this Scholia,
containing [l] [m] [n] [o] [p] [q] be placed immediately after K. and Page 36.
in each particular place also, shall be at large declared.

8. But before we attempt this, we are to consider that both Bodies of Mankind,
as also Medicaments are for the most part hot or cold, viz. hot and moist, or
hot and dry, which Physicians call a sulphurious saline Habit; or cold and
moist, or cold and dry, which they call a saline sulphurious Habit, according
to which Habits proper Medicaments are to be destinated.

9 However the principles of Physic as they relate to Man's Body, or to
Medicaments are necessary to be known, or at least wise in what Sense
Naturalists and Chemists apprehend them: In Man, there is a Body, a Spirit, and
a Soul; these united make the complete Man: these in their Natural State free
from disorders, perturbations, or irregularities, renders him in perfect
Health: If they never so little vary from their Natural State, it is in order
to Diseases, and a final dissolution of the Compositum.

10. But whereas we speak here of Body, Spirit and Soul, we intend a Body
Spiritual, although we call it Natural: But we understand it Spiritual, only in
opposition to the primary external appearance, or outward form: as for example,
in a vegetable, suppose Rosemary in its primary external form, the Body
consists of Stalks, Leaves, and Flowers; but when by the ART of the Chemist an
Extraction is made; you have a pure, subtle, and volatile Oil, wherein its
Energy, Virtue and Power, answers to the Life and Soul of Man, its Volatility,
Flame and Oleosity to the Spirit, and its material Substance to the Body: viz.
that Body which we call Natural in opposition to a thing truly Spiritual;
although it is indeed a Spiritual Body in its kind in respect to its first
Earthy or natural form, or appearance: this Conjunction of Principles in Man,
is that which Philosophers call the Archaeus, the Archaeus of Nature, or the
Archaeus in Man.

11. Now as to the Principles of Medicaments: Here Philosophers much vary,
some, as Doctor Willis, make five Principles, viz. Salt, Sulphur, Mercury,
Water, and Earth, but these five we have proved in our Pharmacopaeia
Londinensis, lib. 6. cap. 1. to be only three; viz. Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury,
excluding his Phlegm, and Caput Mortuum: Others, as Paracelsus, Crollius, make
but three, as indeed they are, and these three we make but one; as the Body,
Spirit, and Soul in Man, make but one Archaeus, so the Salt, Sulphur, and
Mercury of all mixed Bodies make but one only true Principle, which for
distinction sake, we in like manner call Potestates or the Powers.

12. In proof whereof, we say this, That we deny not, but that as to the
outward appearance, a Chemist may Extract a Salt in form of Salt, a Sulphur in
form of Oil, and a Mercury in form of Spirit, to which he may give the Names
aforesaid, but these Names rather respect their form of appearances, than the
true Nature: For he must necessarily grant me, that in all Salts, as there is a
Body, so there is an Oleaginous Property, which is Sulphur, and an Energetick
Virtue, which is the Mercury, or Spirit; unless they will deny any Virtue, or
Power, in the said Salt at all. So likewise in the Sulphur, or Oil; who so
Blind as cannot see, or feel a Body there, which Body by their own Concessions,
Answers to their first Principle of Salt, its oleaginous and flamy property,
argues their second Principle or Sulphur; and its subtilty, volatility, and
penetrating quality, argues the third Principle, which is Mercury, or Spirit.
Again, in the Mercury or Spirit, there is no less a Body seen than in the Salt
and Oil, which Body demonstrates their first Principle, as aforesaid; viz.
Salt. Its Inflamility, demonstrates their Sulphur, or second Principle; and its
Energetick, or penetrative Power and Force makes manifest their third
Principle, which is Mercury or Spirit.

13. Hence it appears, That the Principles of all things are really but one;
though subsisting under three several forms and Subsistences: For Salt is only
the Body, Spirit and Soul Concentrated; the Sulphur, is the Salt, Spirit and
Oil embodied in a more subtle appearance, and the Mercury is the Salt, Oil, and
Spirit expanded, or dilated, as may be said to an Infinity.

14. So that it is manifest, that those three are but one, though some may
object, that they are three different Principles, from the Nature of their
Operation; mistaking the way and manner, how they exert their Powers and
Forces, which is not from the different Nature of the things or Principles so
called; but from their manifestation or manner of subsistence and appearance:
this is apparent in an Iron Tool, if it be sharp with a Point, it only Pricks;
if it has a sharp Edge, then it Cuts; but if it has neither Point nor Edge, it
only Bruises; and yet notwithstanding the substance is but one, though the
forms or appearances be many, from whence follows their particular way or
manner of action.

15. Thus much as to Principles, which is what we understand of them, and how
we would have the Physician understand us, through all this following Work,
viz. What we mean by the Archaeus, and what we mean by Potestates, or Powers,
through which, the Energy of Medicaments are conveyed, in order to the Healing
of the Diseases incident to Mankind.

16. The Pathology of Diseases, we shall explicate under a six-fold
Consideration, viz. The Name, Definition, Kinds, Signs, Causes, and
Prognostics of the same; afterward the Therapia, showing the various Ways and
Methods of Cure: first, general, according to the threefold acceptance of
Diseases: secondly, particularly, in respect of the various Causes producing.

17. This as the Preamble to what we intend: We shall now come to show the
Order, in which every Disease shall be handled: First, Diseases of the Head:
Secondly, Diseases of the Thorax, or Breast: Thirdly, Diseases of the Abdomen,
or Belly: Fourthly, Fevers: Fifthly, Diseases of the extreme parts, viz.
Tumors, Wounds, Ulcers, Fractures and Dislocations.

18. Diseases of the Head; are either: first, In the Menings: secondly, In the
substance of Brain: thirdly, In the Cavities of the Brain: fourthly, in the
Cutaneous Teguments of the Head: fifthly, In the Parts of the Head, as Eyes,
Ears, Nose, Mouth, Palate, etc.

19. Diseases in the Menings of the Brain are chiefly the Chephalalgia, the
Cephalaea, or old Headache, the Megrim, or half Headache; Diseases in the
Cavities of the Brain are chiefly, a Vertigo, Catarrh, Epilepsia, Apoplexia,
Palsy, Convulsion, Trembling, Incubus, etc. Diseases in the Substance of the
Brain are the Phrensy, Melancholy, Madness, loss or hurt of Memory, sleepy
Diseases, etc. Diseases in the Skin or Covering of the Head, are the Alopecia,
Ophiasis, Baldness, Lousiness, Scald-head, Wounds of the Skull, etc.

XXIX. Of the Headache, its Name, Definition, and Kinds.

1. The Name, in Greek, is (...), in Latin, Capitis Dolor, and in English, the
Headache.

2. The Definition. It is a sensation of pain afflicting the Head, either
Internal or External, situate between the first Vertebra of the Neck, and the
Roots of Eyes; and laterally, between the Bones of the Temples on either side.

3. The Kinds. The Headache is threefold; first, when it is neither Vehement
nor Inveterate or old, arising suddenly from some present Cause: secondly, when
it is Inveterate or old, being of many years continuance, coming and returning
at certain Periods of time without any apparent praevious Cause; thirdly, When
it afflicts the one half of the Head, either right or left, of all which we
shall speak in order.

XXX. The Pathalogy of the first sort of Headache before named; and first of
the Cause thereof.

1. It is called in Greek (...), and in Latin by Barbarous Writers Soda, (which
is indeed an Arabic Word) and by us in English simply the Headache. It is
sufficiently known by the pains excited through the whole Head, the general
Causes are twofold, the first is called (...) which is the primitive, or first
but remote Cause; the other (...) which is the internal Cause: and is indeed
for the most part the effect of the first Cause.

2. The Procatartick or external Cause, is either from Blows, Sun, Air, Wind,
or from some violent Motion; as, Falls, and great Exercises, or vehement
Intemperature of heat or cold, dryness or moisture. The Proegumenine, or
internal Causes, are from a simple Intemperature of the part, being too cold,
hot, moist, or dry, or from some peternatural matter Super abounding, arising
for the most part from some sulphurious Vapor, or flatulent Spirit, either,
simply in the part, or by consent from the Stomach, or other parts.

3. If the Cause be from a simple Intemperature of heat, whether External; or
Internal; the first is known by the Relation of the Sick; as, whether he has
been in the heat of the Sun, or Fire, or has been using any Violent Motion or
Exercise, whereby the part may be Inflamed; the second, or Internal Cause is
known, first by the sulphurious and hot habit of Body, and the super-abundant
heat of the part, which may be known by touching: Moreover, if hot things be
applied to it, the Sick is Enraged, but if cold things, the Sick is Refreshed,
and the pain is Eased.

4. If it be from a simple Intemperature of cold, the Procatartick or External
Cause may be known by the Relation of the Sick; as, whether he has taken cold,
or has been laid in a cold place, etc. the Proximate or near Cause, is known,
first, from a cold habit of Body; secondly, from the frigidity of the part, by
touching of it, the Face also is of a pale or wan Color; lastly, The Sick is
Refreshed by hot things, but the pain is excited or enraged, by the application
of cold things.

5. Now in both the foregoing Cases of heat and cold, they are both of them
joined either with dryness or moisture, if they be joined with dryness, it is
known by the dry habit of the Body, by the dryness and hardness of the part,
roughness of the Skin, and want of Excrements, from the Head, either by the
Nostrils or Palate: but if moisture be the Concomitant of the aforesaid
Qualities, it is known by the humid habit of the Body, laxity, softness and
delicate color of the Skin; as also, by a great many Excrements flowing from
the Head by the Nostrils or Palate, and the aptness of the Sick to have a
Catarrh.

6. If it arises from a flux of matter from the Brain; it is known, first, by
the evil Diet and course of Life going before in the Sick, in whom by reason of
Idleness, too plentiful Eating and Drinking, and giving himself over to a
Sensual and Debauched course of Life many evil Humors are generated, which
afflict the Head either by consent from the Stomach, or by corrupting of the
Blood, whereby the Brain is filled with many Excrements, which sensibly hurt
the internal Menings.

7. If it be by consent from the Stomach, it is known by a preceding weakness
and illness of the Stomach, aptness to Vomit, want of Appetite, and an ill
Digestion, by means of which the Ventricle being filled with Wind, sends
Vapors up into the Brain, which abounding in the Cavities, stretches the
Menings, by which there is a Sensation of pain.

8. Sometimes the Procatartick Cause is from Drunkenness, with too much filling
the Ventricle and weakening of it; a flatulent Spirit is generated which in the
form of Vapors ascending up into the Head, afflicts the Tunicles, aforesaid;
as also by an intimate mixtion with the Chyle, an evil Blood is made,
containing many Excrements, which being upon the least occasion fermented,
causes Vapors to arise, and so hurts the Tunicles aforesaid.

9. If it be from a Fever, or the French Pox, it is known by those Diseases
going before, whose Causes is the same with the Cause of the said Diseases, and
the Removal of which must be only by the Extirpating of the Disease Causing.

10. If it be from a hurt in the Skull; as a Contusion, Wound, or Fracture, the
Procatartick Cause is evident to the Senses, the Proximate or near Cause is the
Solution of continuity or unity; in a Contusion there is a livid Color of the
Skin, together with the swelling of the part and pain; in a Wound there is a
Solution of continuity, with a Rupture of the Vessels; in a Fracture, the
Symptoms are according to the magnitude thereof: where the Skull is depressed
upon the Menings the following Symptoms are very grievous, as Vomiting, a
pungent or pricking pain; sometimes an Apoplexy or Convulsion, sometimes a loss
of the Voice, Reason and Understanding, which for the most part are Mortal
signs. If so be the Blood flows through the Fracture of the Cranium, upon the
Dura Matter, it endangers the Corrupting thereof.

11. The parts afflicted in all these Cases, are the Menings of the Brain, and
the Pericranium or thin Skin covering the Unequal part of the Skull; if it
afflicts the Menings, the pain is Internal and within the Skull; Physicians
commonly know it by the Extension of the pain to the Roots of the Eyes,
because, they say, and truly enough, For that the Tunicles of the Eyes have
their Original and Rise from them; but this cannot be the true sign; For that
others, as Fernelius do affirm, That a pain in the External part of the Head
afflicting the Pericranium, will affect the Roots of the Eyes also, for as much
as they have membranes from the Pericranium, in like manner. It may be then
demanded by what sign or signs the Pain of the Head within the Skull afflicting
the Menings, may be known from an External Pain of the Head afflicting the
Pericranium.

12. To this We answer; first, That in an External Pain of the Head or the
Pericranium, there is for the most part, if not always a sensation of soreness
upon the least touching of it; whereas if the Pain be internal, there is no
appearance of any such thing; Now several great Anatomists as the most
excellent Bartholin, does affirm, There belongs to the Skull both a Pericranium
and Periostium; whereas Fernelius says, An external Pain of the Head, does
reach to the Roots of the Eyes, it is supposed when the Pericranium is only
afflicted, but if the Periostium be only afflicted that sign will always be
wanting.

13. Hitherto of the general Causes of Pain in the Part, which are indeed the
Effects of the more prime Causes; there remains now, that we show the true
Cause of Pain it self, wheresoever it happens, The original of all sense and
motion is from the Brain; from whence the Animal Spirits running in their proper
Channels. to wit, the Nerves, convey the same through, and into all parts of the
Body, from Head to Foot, the free Current of these Spirits according to their
own natural Motion, are only in Bodies free from Pain, but if the Motion be
torrid by any kind of force or violence, or if any part in which these Spirits
abound be any ways hurt, whereby Motion is obstructed, they flow thither in
great have, and by an Irregular Motion to remove that obstruction, but not
being able, by that mighty afflux of Spirits, there is a Collision, or beating
one against another in the several Channels of the Nerves, by which Pricking
them, Pain is immediately Excited, and the magnitude of that Pain is according
to the greatness of the Flux of these Spirits and the vehemence of their
Collision.

XXXI. The Prognostics of a Cephalalgia.

1. Where the Causes are simple, from a simpe Intemperature of the parts,
whether it be with in or without the Skull it is always without danger, and of
no difficult Cure; and an external Headache, is always easier to be Cured, than
an internal.

2. If it proceeds from matter abounding whether in the Periostium or
Pericranium, without the Skull, or in the Menings, of the Brain, within the
Skull, the Cure is much more difficult, than when it Rises from a simple
Intemperature; yet it is without danger, unless the matter flowing Causes an
Apostemation of the Brain, which is for the most part mortal.

3. That Headache which arises from consent in the Stomach, will be as durable
as the Cause from whence it proceeds, and when the disaffection of the Stomach
is removed, the Pain of the Head will then Cease.

4. If it proceed from Drunkenness, it is without danger and commonly
terminates in the space of twenty four hours; If it proceeds from a Fever or
the French Pox, its Prognostics as to the danger in time of Cure, are to be
fetched from the Prognostics of those Diseases; If it be in a sharp Fever,
with thin and white Urine, it is dangerous; For that a strong sulpherous and
violent hot Matter is sent to the Brain, from whence there is danger of a
Phrensy: If it be without a Fever, it signifies according to Hippocrates, in
Coacis, an Apoplexy or Epilepsy, to be at hand: For that much of a Saline
sulphurious Matter, cold and moist, with a certain kind of Viscosity afflicts
the Brain; the same understand, if the Headache be accompanied with a Vertigo,
or Deafness or Numbness of the Hands.

5. If it be caused from a contusion, Wound or Fracture of the Skull, the
danger is according to the greatness of the Cause; in a simple Contusion or
Wound it is without danger; in a Fracture of the Skull there is hope of Life
and Recovery, while the Menings of the Brain remain unhurt; but if they were
hurt, though the fracture be Cured and the Wound Healed, there will be
continually a return of Pain either at certain Periodical times, or upon the
least disturbance of the Brain; the which can be no otherwise remedied, then by
perpetual keeping the Skull open with a Plugg.

6. In a Headache proceeding from Repletion, or matter abounding, if Pus, Snot,
or Water flow forth by the Nostrils, Ears, or Eyes, there will be hops of a
speedy and sudden Cure; But if a strong Pain in the Head seises suddenly
without Evacuation following, or Mitigation of its Vehemence, it is Mortal; For
it shows the destruction of the Animal Faculty, which is now without sense of
the matter Causing the grief; moreover in a great Headache it is of evil
Consequence to have the outward and extreme parts cold; For by the vehemence of
the pain and heat, by virtue of strong attraction to the part affected there
may be danger of an Inflammation.

7. If so be a vehement Headache feizes after the Cure of a Disease in the
Visera or Bowels, in the Thorax, or Abdomen, proceeding from Putrefaction, it
shows a translation of the matter to the Brain; from whence arises for the
most part an Apostemation which is mortal

XXXII. The Therapia, or Method of Cure: and first of a Headache, proceeding
from a simple Intemperature of heat and dryness.

1. The Method of Cure depends upon the Cause, according to the Proverb,
sublata Causa tollitur Effectus; if it be only external, or outward, and
proceeds from a simple Intemperature of heat and dryness, it must be Cured by
the application of things cold and moist.

2. In this Case, you may anoint the Temples, Forehead, and parts pained with
this Ointment: Take Oil of Roses, Oil of Water Lillies, of each one ounce: Oil
of Poppy-seed by expression, half an ounce: mix them, and apply it, leaving the
Sick to his Repose; but if the Pain be very vehement, it will be good to mix
with the aforesaid Oils about an ounce of Vinegar of Roses, then in this
mixture dip Clothes, or Rose-Cakes, applying them to the place afflicted,
binding them on.

3. Or, you may take fair Water, making it moderately warm, and with a Sponge
dipped in the same, you may Bath or foment the parts afflicted: For thereby the
Head will be humected, the Pores will be opened, and the hot fiery Particles
which was the Cause of the Disease will exhale: But in this last Case, it will
be never the worse, if you mix with the warmed Water aforesaid, a half, or
third part of Vinegar of Roses.

4. Inwardly, the Sick may Take Conserves of Roses, and Flowers of Water
Lillies, of each two ounces: Lozenges of Sugar pearled, an ounce and a half;
made into an Electuary with a sufficient quantity of syrup of Violets: At Night
going to Bed, and the Morning following, he may take this following
Refrigerating Potion: Take Waters of Endive and Succory, of each three ounces:
Violet Water, two ounces: to which, add syrup of the juice of Citrons, one
ounce and a half; mix them, for two Doses.

5. Let the Food be cooling, and of good juice, such as Chickens, Fishes of
gravelly places, and Rear Eggs, and such Meats as are Souced, and Pickled
Sawces. Of Herbs to be used Sallatwise, he may Eat freely Lettice, Purslane,
and Cucumbers, and then take long Sleeps.

6. If his Belly be Costive; let him now and then Take a little Sal Prunellae,
dissolved in fair Water, and sweetened with syrup of Roses solutive: Or, it may
be loosned by an Emollient Clyster, made of Chicken, or Mutton Broth, twelve
ounces, plus minus: Oil Olive, four ounces: Sugar, three ounces: mix, dissolve,
and let it be exhibited warm.

7. If these things do not; you must give Damask Prunes to Eat together, with
the Syrup thereof; which have been first Boiled, or Stewed with choice Sena,
one ounce thereof, to a pound and a half of Prunes, with a sufficient quantity
of Water.

XXXIII. A Headache proceeding from heat and moisture.

1. As in the former, so here we must perform the Cure by things opposite in
Nature: In regard the Disease proceeds from heat and moisture, we must make
application of things cold and dry; but herein we must be very cautious of
using things too cold, least we thereby so close the Pores as to hinder the
Particles of heat from Exhaling.

2* Therefore, whatsoever is applied, though it be cold by Nature; it ought to
be actually hot, or at least warm; that whilst the Medicament, by its
Energetick Property, may cool and dry the part, so also by its external Action,
it may attract and draw forth the heat thereof.

3. For that external heat, is as great an Instrument of cooling, as the
application of the coldest thing in Nature: And what the Medicament does
Essentially perform by its own Energy, it doubles accidentally by its external
heat: For as much, as by opening and keeping the Pores open, it gives place for
all the fiery Particles to transpire, as aforesaid.

4. Therefore in the first place, Take Plantain Water, four ounces: Infusion of
Galls, two ounces: Sal Prunellae, two drams: mix, and dissolve, and foment the
place pained, therewith warm.

5. Or thus, Take Poppy Water, four ounces: Opium, two dram: dissolve them, and
apply to the part pained, warm, with double Clothes, Spunges, or Rose Cakes.

6. If these do nothing; we must come to stronger and more forcible Remedies:
Take strong Leaven, fitted for making of Rye-Bread, four ounces: Opium, three
drams: mix them well together, and with a sufficient quantity of Poppy-Water,
make a Cataplasm.

7. Internally, you may give this: Take Conserve of red Roses, three ounces:
Conserve of Corn Poppy flowers, Conserve of Water-Lillies-flowers, of each two
ounces: Conserve of Wood and Garden Sorrel, of each one ounce, Oil of Sulphur,
sixty drops: mix all well together: of which let the Patient take about half an
ounce in the Morning fasting; just before Dinner at Noon; and last at Night,
going to Bed.

8. Let his Diet be cooling and dry, let his Bread be Leavened; his Food,
dressed with Pickled Sawces, and things in their Nature cooling.

9. If it be apparent, that moisture abounds very much in quantity; Cupping
glasses, or Vesicatories must be applied, either to the Nape of the Neck, or
Shoulders, or rather, in My Opinion to the Soles of the Feet, by reason of the
great consent betwixt the Head and the Feet.

XXXIV. The Cure of the Headache from cold and dryness.

1. In the first place, the use of Topics are advised, which warm and humect:
Take Oil of Camomil, two ounces: Oleum Nardinum, one ounce: Oil of Nutmegs by
expression, three drams: mix and anoint the part affl cted; also Powder of
Nutmegs may be drawn up the Nostrils, for that immediately and wonderfully
gives ease in a Head ach, proceeding from a cold Cause.

2. Or, Take Oil of Roses, Oil of Rue, of each one ounce: Camphir (dissolved in
a little Chemical Oil of sweet Marjoram) two drams: mix them, and anoint
therewith; it is a Potent Remedy, and gives present ease.

3. A Cataplasm made of Turnips being Baked, and applied as hot as can be
endured, eases the pain to admiration, and humects and softens the place: The
same does New Bread out of the Oven, being applied as hot as it can be endured:
A Cataplasm made of Onions and Oil of Roses, has done great matters in this
Case: The same also does Garlic, made into a Cataplasm with Oil of Rue, and
applied to the place pained.

4. If these things prevail nothing: Take Oil of Roses, three ounces: Oil of
Rosemary Chemical, one ounce: Oil of Amber, half an ounce: mix them well, with
these anoint the part pained twice or thrice a day; applying over after
anointing, a Cataplasm made of Colewort leaves; this remedy you shall hardly
find ever fail.

5. However, this is not all that is to be done* for those persons of a cold
and dry Constitution* if so be they are often afflicted with the Headache,
there will be a necessity for us to endeavor to alter the Habit of the Body,
which is done by things of a heating and humecting Nature: Let him often take
Balsam of Peru, mixed with Oil of Nutmegs by expression in equal quantities; of
this the Patient may take every Night going to Bed, and every Morning fasting,
the quantity of a dram at a time; Drinking after it a little glass of Sack, it
has a mighty power in it to warm and comfort both Head and Stomach.

6. So also the Tincture of Black Pepper, made with the spirit of Wine,
digested till it be near blood Red: it may be given in Beer, Ale, Wine, Broth,
and Milk, from ten drops to twenty, thirty, forty, or more; it restores in
Consumptions, and refreshes the Animal Spirits almost to a Miracle.

7. Among the number of those things which are chief to warm and comfort a cold
Head and Brain; nothing is indeed more powerful than the Spirit and Oil, or
Power of Rosemary, to be taken in the Morning fasting, in a small Dose, and the
Spirit and Tincture of Castoreum, given in a Glass of Wine, as aforesaid.

8. The Sick may Eat and Drink Milk, or Whey; because they are accompanied with
a moistning quality: So also new Cheese-Curds, before they are made into
Cheese; and also Candied things, as Citron, Orange, and Limon-peels, Nutmegs
preserved, or candied, green Ginger, and what Drink he drinks, he may sweeten
it with Syrup of Clove Gillyflowers, or Marshmallows.

XXXV. The Cure of the Headache proceeding from cold and moisture.

1. It is twofold; first, where the Intemperature is simple, without any
greater abundance of moisture than the natural habit of the Body; or, secondly,
It is a Disease of Repletion, wherein moisture does very much abound above the
said natural habit.

2. If it be the first, you are to Bath the Forehead, Temples, and other parts
pained with things that mightily heat and dry: Take Oil of Nutmegs by
expression, one ounce: Chemical Oils of Rosemary, Limons and Oranges, of each
one dram: mix them, and anoint the place pained therewith.

3. If the pain be extreme: Take Chemical Oils of Anniseeds, Oil of Rosemary,
Oil of Sage, of each one dram: Camphir, half a dram: mix, and anoint therewith;
it is a great Remedy, and of mighty force to remove the aforesaid Evil.

4. If these things do not; you must apply your self to the use of Narcoticks:
Take spirit of Wine, half a pint: Opium, half an ounce: dissolve the Opium
therein and strain it; in the strained Liquor, dissolve Camphir, two drams;
Bath the part with this, it shall not fail you.

5. Lastly, the Diet ought to be heating and drying; his Bread ought to be made
with Fennel-seeds, Caraway-seeds, or Anniseeds, well Baked, or twice Baked, as
Biscuit; he may now and then drink generous Wine, provided it be moderately;
Spiced Wine, and the Wine of Pope Adrian, which is no mean thing.

6. If it so be that moisture super-abounds; we must have other Considerations,
in order to the Cure: For, that we have now something of matter to take away;
if the Symptoms be not very vehement; we first, apply our selves to the taking
away the Cause; otherwise, if the pain be vehement, we must first endeavor the
alleviation of that.

7, As to the six Non-Naturals, he ought to choose a free, clear, serene Air to
live in, he ought to forbear Sleeping in the day time; and, if possible to make
choice of the Night for his Rest, he ought to use Exercise and Motion: For
thereby the Humors come to be Rarefied, the Pores to be opened, whereby a
great part of the humid matter seem to Exhale; his Food ought to be heating and
drying, and therefore Roasted Meats are better for him than Boiled: Wild Foul
are better than tame, and Sawces made of Spice, are better than those made of
Fruits, or other cold things: let his Drink be generous, or fragrant Wine, and
especially spic'd Wine: things of Volatile parts, such as Roots of Parsley,
Watercresses, Mustard, Raddishes, and the like, are of good use: So also
Citron, Orange, and Limon-peels candied, Coriander, Comfits, and such like
things, he may Eat freely of.

8. All things of a cold Nature, such as Purslane, Lettice, Cucumbers, and
Mellons are to be avoided as Poison; so also Hogs-Flesh, and the Flesh of Water
Fowls: His Bread ought to be well baked, and Biscuit, if he likes it, it
transcends all other things: with which he may Eat Almonds, Nuts, Raisons of
the Sun, Pine-Nuts, Dates, and such like; but all manner of Milk Meats, as also
Pease, Beans, and other Pulse are to be avoided.

9. Having now shown the Patient, what he is to do, it now remains to show what
is the Physicians part: he is in the first place to take Care, That these
Symptoms be alleviated, which is by the application of things hot and dry, and
such are those things which we have not particularly ennumerated in the
forepart of this Section, where we treated of a Headache from a simple
Intemperature; to which may be added if the Pain be vehement, Camphir dissolved
in the spirit of Wine, and mixed with Oil of Pepper, half an ounce: Oil of
Roses, an ounce: strained Opium, three drams: make a Liniment, according to
Art; wherewith let the part pained be anointed.

10. To the Head may be applied a Cucupha or Cap: Take Powder of Orrice, four
ounces: Powder of Cloves, two ounces and a half: Nutmegs, Storax, and Benjamin,
of each one ounce: mix them, to make a quilt of.

11. Moreover, let the Sick smell to a Perfume made of Musk, Ambergrise, and
Liquid Storax, or he may smell to an Essence made of the Oil of Rhodium, mixed
with equals parts of the Oil of Sassafras.

12. Fumes also of Amber, Frankincense, and the like, are very profitable,
being taken-in by a Funnel at the Mouth, two, three, four, or six times or more.

13. Hitherto of the easing of the Symptom, it remains now, that we use our
Endeavor to take away the Cause, without removal of which, we cannot hope for
a certain Cure, but there will be a Repetition of many Paroxysms; this is done,
either by Topics externally applied, or Medicaments internally given.

14. As for Topics, it is necessary that the Head be Purged with prop^r
Errhins, either liquid, as these following: Take Juice of Beets, Juice of sweet
Marjoram, Juice of Prim-Roses, and Juice of Rue, of each equal quantities: mix
them, and let them be Injected into the Nostrils.

15 Or, you may use this, which is inferior to none: Take half a pint of White
Wine, dissolve in it Euphorbium, one dram: which let the Sick Snuff up the
Nostrils, by means of which the Head will be abundantly Purged.

16. Them that like not the Liquid Errhins, they may use these following: Take
Confectio Hamech, one ounce: Scammony, Gutta Gamba, Agarick troschiscated, of
each half an ounce: Euphorbium, in a very subtle Powder, one dram: mix, and
make a Mass for Errhines, to be put up the Nostrils, by which the Head will be
extremely Purged; these Errhines may be used about two hours before going to
Bed, for four or five several Nights.

17. But the most excellent of all things of this kind, is the Sternutatory of
Decker's, which although some may esteem to be dangerous, not only the Experience
of that learned Man, but our manifold Trials of the same, have sufficiently
evinced the contrary: And we can say, upon our own Knowledge, That its
Operation is almost Miraculous.

18. If these things do not, manifold Frictions ought to be used to the extreme
parts, Cupping Glasses may be applied to the Shoulders, Hips, and Brawny parts
of the Arms and Thighs, or for those that Fancy not Cupping Glasses,
Vesicatories may take place in those parts; which said Cuppings or Blysters,
ought to be so often repeated, till the Humidity is apparently drawn away; I
have often times Cured this Disease by drawing Blysters two, three, or four
several times over the whole Head.

19. Where the Disease proves Rebellious, and will not yield to any of all
those things it is necessary, that a Seton be applied to the Nape of the Neck; or
Issues be made in the Arms, and Inferior parts of the Thighs, which ought to
be continued, till the Habit of the Body is altered.

20. Thus far as to Topics; we come now to internal Medicaments, that we may
take away the Root of the Cause: If moisture abounds not much, it may be
evacuated by Sweating: For which purpose you may give fifteen, or sixteen
grains of Bezoar Minerale, in an ounce and a half of Treacle Water; or, in Aqua
Vitae Mathioli.

21. You may also give the Tinctura Sudorifica Paracelsi, to two drams or more:
mix it with an ounce of Sylvius his Prophylactick Water; if these things
provoke not Sweat powerfully, you may exhibit Volatile Salt of Toads, or Vipers
to six, or seven grains, mixed with one of Mithridate, or Venice Treacle.

22. If these prevail nothing, you must have recourse to Opiats, amongst which,
Our Specific Laudanum, or Confectio Anodyna, and Guttae Vitae, are chief: Some
have used the Liquid Laudana of Helmont, and of Scheffer, as also the Laudanum
of Peter Faber, with the same success.

23. But if the cold and moist Disposition of the Head, proceeds from a cold
and moist Habit of the whole Body (as for the most part it does) and that
moisture super-abounds in an extreme manner, we must begin the Cure after
another Way; for as much as it is one of the hardest things in the Art of
Medicine, to alter and remove a cold and moist habit of Body.

24. First, therefore let the whole Body be thoroughly Purged with such things
as effectually evacuate pituitous and watery Humors: Take Pilulae Rudij, two
drams: de Agarico, one dram and half: Resin of Jallap, one dram: Mercurius
dulcis three times sublimed, two scruples: mix, and with a little syrup of
Buckthorn, make a Mass of Pills. dose from one scruple to half a dram: in
strong Bodies: Syrup of Buckthorn may be given alone, from one ounce to two, in
the Morning fasting: Take Pil. Aggregativae, Pil. Cochiae, of each two drams:
Troches Alhandal, Resin of Jallap, of each one dram: Elaterium, a scruple, mix
and make Pills with Syrup of Buckthorn, to which add a few drops of Oil of
Caraways, or of Cloves. Dose one scruple or more, to half a dram.

25. These things are to be given often, with due intervals between Purging,
that the Body may not be weakened too much. Among other Remedies none seems to
be more excellent than Our Family Pills, whether with or without Aloes, being
given in the Morning fasting from one scruple to half a dram: according to Age,
Strength, and Sex.

26. But where solid Medicaments cannot be taken (for some cannot swallow
Pills) We commend the Tinctura Cathartick Clossaei, given a spoonful at a
time, with half an ounce of Syrup of Limons, or an ounce of Syrup of Roses
solutive, made sharp with Oil of Sulphur.

27. If it be a Woman kind, and she be troubled with Fits of the Mother, Wind
or Vapors, it will be good to mix with the Purges aforesaid, as also with such
as may be hereafter commended, some notable Hysteric, as the Elixer Hystericum
Maxij, which may be given to one dram and a half: The Tincture of Castor,
Spirit or Salt of Hartshorn, the Powers of Jet, or black Amber, and such like,
plenty where of you may see in our Pharmacooeia and Doron.

28. To the former Catharticks you may add, The Tincture of Sena Compound, Our
Magistrall Cathartick Tincture, and Our Tinctura extribus; the two first of
which may be given from one ounce to two; the latter, from half an ounce to one
ounce, or more; mixed with a spoonful of Syrup of Limons.

29. The Tincture of Our Family Pills we here also commend, being given two or
three spoonfulls at a time, with a little Syrup of Limons, or of the Juice of
Citrons: Here also take place the Tinctura Phlegmagoga, Melanagoga and
Hydragoga Grulingij, to be given as in the former directions.

30. But if the Ventricle by very much afflicted and there is an appearance of
very tough viscous Humors, chiefly of Phlegm. It is necessary that Cutting
Medicines by first Used, such are the Spirits and Oils of Salt, Sulphur and
Vitriol, which may be given to four or six Drops in such Liquor as the Sick
commonly Drinks; but these are not long to be Continued, because of their
cooling quality; but only so long till the Viscosity is somewhat attenuated and
incided.

31. This done an Emetick ought forthwith to be exhibited; to this purpose we
commend the Antimonial Emetick syrup of Sala; Our Catharticum Argenteum,
together with the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, and the Liquor Vitae Aureus
Rulandi; any of which you are to give in such a due Dose, as may respect the
Strength, or Weakness, Age, Sex, or other Properties of the Sick.

32. These Vomits ought so long to be continued, till the Stomach is
effectually cleansed; afterward you are to Purge the Body downwards with the
things before ennumerated.

33. But in the first place before either Purge or Vomit be given; you are to
consider the Constitution of the Bowels; whether the Sick be Costive or
Laxative, or in a mean; if the Body be Laxative, you are to give the Purges
aforementioned, in somewhat less Proportion.

34. If Costive, you are before you attempt any other Evacuation, to give this
following Clyster: Take Decoctum Commune, eight ounces: Infusion of Crocus
Metallorum, three ounces: Electuary Diacatholicon, one ounce: Oil Olive, two
ounces: mix, and then give it warm.

35. Or, you may exhibit Enema Pituitam Purgans, or Enema in Capitis
affectibus Mynsichti, or Enema in Causa a duritial faecum Mynsichti, any of
which will enough open and loosen the Body; besides which they draw Humors and
Vapors from the Head, which is partly the Cause of its Pain.

36. These Clysters are to be twice, thrice, or more repeated, till the
Constitution of the Bowels be apparently altered; the Belly being now made
Solluble, the before enumerated Emeticks, or Purgations may with safety be
administered.

37. But that which is most worthy to be considered is, whether the Disease be
Simple or Complicate, if Simple the Praescriptions of themselves are enough.

38. But if they be Complicated with any other Disease; you must always mix
with the Medicaments prescribed against the Headache, whether Emeticks,
Catharticks, or Alteratives, such things as are either Specificks, or proper
against the Complication.

39. As for Example, if the Scurvey be Concomitant, you ought to mix with your
Medicaments against the Headache Antiscorbuticks, as Spirits of Scurvey-grass,
Water cresses, Brook-lime, Tarragon, Rocket, Horseradish, Mustard Seed, etc.

40. If it be Complicated with Hysteric Passions, you must mix
Anti-Hystericks, such as we have a little before enumerated.

41. If it be Complicated with a Nephritis, you ought to mix Lithontripticks,
or Stone-breakers, and Renals; as, Salt of Egg-shels, Oil of Salt, Powers of
Juniper Berries, Winter Cherries, etc. which may have respect to the part.

42. If it be Complicated with a Tussis or Cough, or Obstructions of the Lungs,
you ought to mix Pectorals and Openers, such are Chemical Oils of Anniseeds and
Dill, Oil and Balsam of Sulphur, Tincture of Spanish Juice of Liquorice, made
in spirit of Wine, and mixed with a quarter part of Oil of Tartar, per
deliquium, and four times the quantity of Canary.

43. Where if the Obstruction be very great, it will not be amiss, to add some
few drops of the spirit of Sal Armoniack.

44. If it be Complicated with an Arthritis or Gout, you ought to mix
Arthriticks, as the Pulvis Arthriticus Paracelsi, or the Essence of Gout-Ivy,
etc.

45. If it be Complicated with Weakness and Distemper of the Stomach, you ought
to mix Stomaticks; such are the Elixir Proprietatis Paracelsi, Elixir of
Wormwood, Potestates or Powers of Wormwood, Elixir of Bay Berries, Elixir of
Mint, the Blood red Tincture of black Pepper.

46. If it be Complicated with any Passion of the Heart, as Fainting, Swooning,
etc. You ought to mix Cordials, as Tinctura Auraea, Tinctura Vitae Nostrae,
Tinctura Cardiaca, Elixir Vitae Rubrum Reinesij, Pulvis ex Chelis Cancrorum
Compositus, Chemical Oil of Cloves and Cinnamon, with the Water and spirit of
Angelica more Compound, etc. And after this manner you must do in all other
Complications.

47. But that the Humor may be fully carried off; Masticatories may be used to
Chew in the Mouth, of which this following of Riverius is no Inferior thing:
Take Pellitory of Spain, two drams: Mustard Seed and Staves-acre, of each one
dram: Mastich, half a dram: make them up with white Wax into little Balls; of
which let one be chewed every Morning, holding down the Head, till the Rhume
fall out.

48. The same Riverius says, That a Blew Flower-de-luce Root is usually for the
same purpose, and may be made use of in small Infirmities.

49. Mastich alone Chewed is the mildest Masticatory, for it attracts and draws
Humors to the Mouth without heat and Inflammation, which others do not.

50. If the Patient be free from a Catarrh or Consumption, he may use the
following Gargarism: Take of Staves-acre, half an ounce: Mustard Seed, three
drams: Pellitory of Spain, one dram and half: Rocket-seed, one dram:
Garden-Cresses, a pugil: boil all in Water and Honey, to four ounces: strain,
and mix therewith Vinegar of Squills, two ounces: it draws moisture out of the
Head by the Palate powerfully.

51. Vomiting, Purging and other Evacuations being ended, that we may thoroughly
evacuate all the remaining superfluous Humidity in the substance of the Flesh
and Skin, which the before enumerated things would not reach, it remains that
the Sick be Sweated several times, as two, three, four or six times, or more,
according to the mighty abundance of the cold and moist humor, and long
Habituation of it in the Body.

52. The Sudorificks, or Diaphoreticks in this Case to be used, we have in part
declared at 20. 21. and 22. of this Section; and a vast number more for this
purpose, you may see in Our Pharmacopoeia and Doron: By this means shall the
Body be divested of all its superfluous humidities and excrementitious Juyces.

53. One thing now remains that we show how to strengthen the Vital Faculties,
that the parts already depraved as to the Function, may hereafter perform those
things, which are according to Nature: For otherwise, what we have hitherto
done will be in Vain, they being weak and not restored, and indeed much more
weakened by the Operations of Physic, it is so much the more requisite, that
Restoratives and Strengtheners should now be added, which may both alter their
former Constitutions, and confirm in them a healthful Disposition.

54. In the first place, therefore it will be good for the Patient to use often
a Cephalic Bath: Take ten or twelve galons of warm Water; dissolve therein two
or three ounces of salt of Tartar: in this Water boil Rosemary, Lavendar, Sage,
Thyme, sweet Marjoram, Hyssop, Chamomil, Pennyroyal, of each three handfuls:
Featherfew, Origanum, Fennel, Dill, Parsley, Smallage, Wormwood, Southernwood,
Hoarhound, of each two handfulls: Brimstone, Sal Niter, of each four ounces:
boil them all together in a large Vessel in part of the aforesaid Water; then
mix with all the remaining part of the Water, and let the Patient bath himself
in it being warm, for his Pleasure or Recreation for half an hour, an hour or
more; repeating this Bathing once a Week, once a Fortnight, or once a Month, as
the occasion requires.

55. Moreover part of this Bath may be put into a Vessel so situated, as
running at a Cock at the lower part of the Vessel that it may run or fall upon
the Crown of his Head, being covered with double Clouts, during the whole time
of his Bathing.

56. The second thing to be done is, to anoint the Forehead, Temples, Nostrils,
and the Nape of the Neck, and if the Head be Shaved, the whole Head, with the
following Composition: Take Chemical Oil of Rosemary, Oil of Lavender, Oil of
Sage, Oil of Sassafras, os each one dram: Oil of Nutmegs by expression, half an
ounce: mix them well, and anoint the places aforesaid therewith Morning and
Evening, for four or five days.

57. Or, you may use this: Take the Powers of Rosemary, of Sage, of Cloves, of
Sassafras, of each two drams: Powers of Limons and Oranges, of each four drams:
Powers of Amber, one dram: mix them, and Bath the place aforesaid therewith
Morning and Night for a Week.

58. Also with it, you may Bath the Stomach, or the whole Abdomen or Belly,
together with the Joints or extreme parts, where you find any Lassitude,
Weakness, or Pain.

59. Thus far as to the Topics, we come now to strengthen the parts by
internal Medicaments, first, we commend the use of Pope Adrian his Wine, which
may be taken every Morning fasting just before Dinner, and last at Night going
to Bed.

60. So also the Vinum Sanctum, the Vinum Claretum Stomachicum, or the Vinum
Cephalicum, than the which there is scarcely any thing more excellent; yet the
Vinum Moschatum Mynsichti is commended above all others.

61. For ordinary Drink, I commend a small Decoction of Guajacum, made in Water
after the manner following: Take Water, twenty quarts: Raspings of Guajacum,
eight ounces: Sarsaparilla, Sassafras, of each four ounces: Rosemary, Sage,
Bawm, Betony, sweet Marjoram, of each an handful: Zedoary, Nutmegs, yellow
Sanders, all bruised into a gross Powder, of each three ounces: Cloves, Mace,
Scordium, of each an ounce and half: boil all together to the Consumption of
six quarts, so as fourteen may remain; strain it out by pressing, then let it
stand till the faeces are settled; decant the clear Liquor, and make it pleasant
with white Sugar, let it gently ferment, if it inclines to it, then bottle it
up, and let it be taken as an ordinary Drink, let this be continued for six or
seven Months, whereby the Habit of the Body may be thoroughly altered.

62. These Medicines following to alter and strengthen the Brain are commended
by Riverius: But because (says he) this is a stubborn Disease, and uses to
produce new Phlegm, both after general and particular Evacuations; we shall
prescribe those Medicines by which the Humor may be abated, and the Head or
Brain preserved in that State into which by Physic it is restored: being first
Purged for the most part twice a Month.

63. In the Intervals of Purging, he may take this following Electuary: Take
Conserves of Acorus roots, or of Ginger, Citron-peels candied, of each one
ounce: Conserves of Sage and Rosemary-flowers, of each six drams: Nutmegs
candied, old Venice Treacle, Confection of Alkermes, of each three drams: the
species of Diambrae, and Diamoschi Dulcis, of each one dram: with syrup of
Citron-peel, make an Electuary, of which let there be the quantity of a Chestnut
taken every Morning fasting before Meat, for the space of two hours, and an
hour before Dinner; drinking after it a little fragrant Wine or choice Canary.

64. This following Balsam does more strongly corroberate the Brain, of which
he may take now and then, or at least every Night going to bed, six, eight, or
ten Drops in Wine or Broth, anointing also the Nostrils within therewith: Take
Chemical Oil of Nutmegs, three drams: Chemical Oils of Marjoram, Rosemary, and
Amber, of each half a dram: Oil of Man's Skull, Musk and Ambergrise, of each one
scruple: mix them together, the Musk and Ambergrise, being first ground into a
subtle Powder.

65. Or this, Take Oil of Oranges; or Orange-flowers, two drams: Fat of Roses,
one dram: Oil of Amber, one scruple: Chemical Oils of Rosemary, Sage and
Spicknard, of each fifteen drops: mix them together, and let them be used as
the former.

66. If those things cannot be had, we commend in the place thereof, the daily
use of Our Electuarium ad Tabidos; or Our Treacle, the greater and lesser
Compositions, but chiefly the Electuarium Antipestilentiale, either of which
may be taken Morning or Night to the quantity of one dram; drinking afer it a
little Glass of Pope Adrian his Wine, or a small quantity of the Queen of
Hungaria her Water.

67. Lastly, Let the Room in which the Sick lodges, or is most conversant in,
be Perfumed with the following Suffiment: Take Amber, Yellow Sanders, Raspings
of Juniper-wood, Mastich, Olibanum, Storax Calamita, Gum Sanderach, of each
half an ounce: Benjamin, Orrice-roots, Frankincense, of each two drams: Cloves,
Nutmegs, Mace, of each one dram: make all into a gross Powder; which sprinkle
upon Charcoal set on fire.

68. With this the Room may be Perfumed Morning and Night every Week; and if he
so pleases, he may take the Fume thereof into his Mouth through a Funnel twice
or thrice a week; for by this means the Head will be exceedingly dried.

XXXVI. The Cure of the Headache from Vapors ascending up into the Brain.

1. If it proceeds from Drunkenness it suddenly passes off, and needs none of
our Instructions for the Cure of it: if it proceeds from Melancholy; Platerus
commends the following: Take Catholicon, half an ounce: Diaphenicon, two drams:
Hamech, a dram: mix them, and take it with Sugar, or an ounce of the Syrup of
Fumetory, or with Whey, or with Cock-Broth.

2. Or, let the Sick take these Pills: Take Pilulae Indiae, two scruples:
Pilulae Agregativae, half a dram: with the juice of Fumetory, make a Mass of
Pills.

3. Or this, which is stronger; Take species Hiera without Saffron, a dram and
half: Extracts of Polypody, and of all the Myrobalans, of each two scruples:
Scammony* extract of black Hellebor, of each a scruple: Lapis LaZuli prepared,
half a dram: Oil of Lavender-flowers, twelve drops: with syrup of Fumetory,
make a Mass of Pills, which may be given from half a dram to a dram.

4. Those that cannot take Pills may take the following Decoction: Take Roots
of Bugloss, Bark of Tamarisk, Bugloss and Scabious flowers, Raisons stoned, of
each one ounce: Staechas, half an ounce: seeds of Millons, two drams: Polypody,
Dates, Sena, of each six drams: Prunes numb. 12. Indian and Cheb Myrobalans, of
each a dram: being all bruised, infuse twenty four hours over a gentle heat,
then boil and strain out; to the strained Liquor add syrup of Roses solutive,
and of Peach-flowers, of each one ounce: Sugar and Nutmeg in Powder, of each
enough to sweeten and aromatize it. This Portion repeat if need be.

5. Or instead hereof, the Pulvis Diatartara Rulandi, which is this: Take Sena,
six drams: Crystals of Tartar, one ounce: Fennel and Anniseeds, of each a dram:
Cinnamon, half a dram: Sugar of Roses, a dram and half, or two drams: make all
into fine Powder. This is a pleasant Powder, and may be given a Spoonful at a
time often.

6. If it proceeds from Vapors from the Stomach, you may give Pills of Hiera
Picra, or Pilulae Aloephanginae, which are of extraordinary use, as also the
Elixir Proprietatis Paracelsi.

7. If the Vapors or Fumes proceed from the Womb, you may Purge with Pilulae
Cochiae, or Pilulae foetidae, or with Our Family Pills with Aloes; these things
cleanse and open the Womb after a wonderful sort.

8. Afterward proper Hystericks may be given of which in their place. However
this following Composition is mightily commended: Take Species of Hiera Picra,
two drams: Agarick, Turbith, of each one dram: Troches Alhandal, Resinous
Scammony, Nutmeg, Mastich, of each half a dram: Ginger, a scruple: Sal Gem,
half a scruple: Oil of Cloves and Lavender-flowers, of each three drops: with
syrup of Staechas make a Mass of Pills: Dose from half a dram to two scruples,
the one half may be given at Night going to Bed, and the other half next
Morning following.

9. Lastly, in all these Cases, it will be of principal moment, often to
administer some of the Clysters in the former Section, for they mightily draw
Vapors from the Head.

XXXVII. The Cure of the Headache arising from a Fever.

1. We ought indeed to take away the Cause, if we would have the Effect to
cease; but because the doing of that would be sometimes long, and the urgency
and vehemence of the Symptom many times requires the more speedy remedy, we
shall here point them forth to you, as they are to be used in order. Ancient
Physicians used immediately to open a Vein, chiefly the Cephalic; but this we
decline.

2. If it be external, the parts Pained ought to Bathed or fomented with Warm
Water, in a pint of which three drams or half a ounce of Sal Prunellae is
dissolved, this ought to be continued for half a hour or there abouts. This
done.

3. You may Embrocate the Head with this: Take Rose Water, four ounces: Vinegar
of Roses, two ounces: Oil of Roses, one ounce: the white of one Egg, mix them
by beating them well together; and Embrocate, as aforesaid; after which dip
Flax, Cotton or double Linen therein, and apply it after the manner of an
Epithem: Or instead hereof, you may anoint with Vnguentum Populneum, or Our
Vnguentum Narcoticum, both which are of good Use. But a Cataplasm of Vervain
made by beating it with Vinegar, is said to be a Specific.

4. This done, this following Clyster from Joel ought to be given to move the
Belly, for thereby the heated parts will be much cooled; the Fever much
abated, Vapors will be drawn downward, and the Pain of the Head will be
signally eased: Take Violet leaves, herb Mercury, Betony, Marjoram, Centory the
less, of each one handful: Pulp of Coloquintida, one dram: the herbs being
bruised, boil all in a pint and half of Water, till three quarters of a pint
only remain, which strain, and to the straining add Hiera simple, one ounce and
half: Oils of Violets and Camomil, of each two ounces: common Salt, one dram:
mix for a Clyster which you are to exhibit warm.

5. Inwardly you are to use Antifebriticks, mixing with the same a few drops of
the Spirit of Sal Anmoniack: and in all his Drink, let him take Salt of
Wormwood ten grains: mixed with Juice of Limons, half a spoonful.

6. If these things do not, after bathing with the Water at 2. above, you may
at Night going to Bed apply the following: Take Vinegar of Roses one ounce:
Poppy water (in which one dram of Sal Prunellae is dissolved) two ounces:
Spirit of Wine (in which Camphir one scruple is dissolved) half an ounce: Opium
extracted with Spirit of Wine and Inspissated to the thickness of Honey, two
drams: white Poppy seeds bruised, one ounce: Oil of Poppy seeds by Expression,
one ounce and half: the White of one Egg: Terra sigillata, two ounces: mix all
well, and upon R se Cakes, Cloth or Leather, apply it as a Pultise.

7. The next Morning following, let him take a strong decoction of Cink-foil
made in part water, part wine, and made pleasant with a Syrup of the Juice of
the same herb; repeating also the Clyster before prescribed, if occasion be;
mean seas n, let Nothing be left undon, toward the removal of the Primary
Cause, viz. the Fever, but let every thing be done in Order. In respect both
to the Fever, and the Pain of the Head: Blisters on the soles of both feet are
of most admirable effects.

XXXVIII. The Cure of the Headache arising from the French Pox.

1: The Headache arising from the French Pox, is to be Cured by taking away that
Disease by the Roots; but we Intend not here a Headache arising simply from the
Pox, but rather one arising from the ill management and vicious application of
Medicaments by ignorant and illiterate Persons, pretending to that Cure.

2. It is Caused for the most part from Mercury ill prepared, ascending up into
the Brain; and sometimes from the Irregularity of the Patient; in both these
Cases the Cure is exceeding difficult; nor has many Physicians performed it;
scarce has any Attempted it; the most Acurate and Faithful Hartman has in a
manner Concluded these Pains Incurable; so what we have to say or declare here,
is wholly without President.

3. Former Physicians in this Case have prescribed a Repetition of Salivations;
others constant Diet Drinks made of Guajacum, sassafras, and sarsa, according
to the common manner.

4. Others have given strong Vomits and purges, continuing their use till the
Patient was brought well near to his Grave; others have applied the Seton,
Cupping Glasses, Vesicatories, and the like, to various parts of the Body.

5. Others have applied Errhines, Sternutatories, Masticatories, and Gargarisme
to the Nostrills and Mouth: others have applied Oils, Unguent^, Cataplasms and
Plasters to the parts affected, of various kinds of qualities, both with and
without Quicksilver.

6. Others have given outwardly and continued the use of Opiats for many mo
ths; others have used strong Sudorificks and Caused the Sick to sweat six,
eight or ten times, or more; and yet notwithstanding all these things have
proved ineff ctual.

7. Others, wiser then their fellows, have made use of all those distinct
Remedies to one only Patient, and yet alas! without success.

8. What now Remains to be done which these Men have not done; or what way can
be further thought of to deliver the Sick from such perpetual excruciating
Torments.

9. But that we may rightly attempt this Cure, if possibly it may be performed,
since so many have shot a side from the Mark, and gone so far astray from
Truth, it behooves us to make a scrutiny both in the Cause of this Herculean
Affect, and the Cause of the Errors and Unsuccessfullness of the former
prescribed Remedies.

10. And first as to the Cause of the Malady, the Procatartick first or remote
Cause, is doubtless a Mercurial Venom, if not the Body of Mercury it self,
contaminating the Tunicles, Ventricles, and, in some measure, the substance of
the Brain it self.

11. The Proegumine, latter, proximate, or conjunct Cause, is an Acid Salt
intimately mixed with the blood, and carried with it to the Films, Ventricles
and substance of the Brain.

12. This acid Salt, it is probable will not simply be the Cause of the pain of
the Head, but meeting with the Mercury thereupon, the least Motion or
Agitation, it seizes upon the Mercury, from whence arises cloudy, obscure, and
poisonous Fumes, such as you see when Quicksilver is put to be dissolved in
Aqua Fortis, which Fumes, if they be in the least manner received into the Head
by the Nostrils, will immediately cause a most intolerable Headache.

13. Now this Pain, made by the Operation of these Fumes, is either from their
stretching the Films of the Brain, or Interrupting the Animal Spirits in the
Cavities, where they are generated or conveyed, or in the Vessels of the Brain
it self; or else from their vellicating or fretting the parts which they touch,
or from their Venine property being wholly Poisonous; thus much as to the Cause.

14. Now it appears, That if an Acid Juice or Salt, be the proximate or
conjunct Cause of this Pain, that all those things which breed and generate an
Acid Salt, must be directly opposite to the Intention of Health.

15. And whereas all the former Artists and and Men of this Profession,
whatever things they Considered of in order to the Cure of the Disease, they
never missed the constant use of Guajacum, to wit, in a Diet prepared therefrom.

16. Now whereas Guajacum contains a most acid Salt, and even in the highest
degree, as every Chemist that has wrought therein can tell you, and produces an
acid Salt or Spirit, which will dissolve Metals, Stones, Bones, and the harder
Substances; it is no wonder indeed that they have so often attempted this Cure
without success, and missed their desire in it.

17. Now it remains, knowing the true Cause of the Disease, and the Reason why
the former Remedies had no Effect, to institute and lay down a Method of
Precepts, which being put in use may infallibly Vanquish this hitherto
Incurable Disease.

18. The chief matter lies in the Diet, next in that thing which will
effectually draw out the Mercury.

19. By the constant use of the Diet for forty, sixty, or a hundred days, the
Blood comes to be thoroughly and perfectly sweetened through a destruction of the
said acid salt; and by the Medicament which we call Hercules by reason of its
mighty Power and Operation; the Mercury is destroyed, extracted and drawn forth.

20. But by what means or Act it performs it, is yet doubtful to us; what we
can most resemble it to, is the Operation of the Head of a Viper, or Poisonous
Serpent in Curing the Biting of the same Creature; which if Remedies be
neglected is always Mortal.

21. Yet if you immediately apply to the place* Biten the bruised Head of the
Serpent, after the manner of a Cataplasm; in which Head is contained (as most
Authors think) all the Poison of the Creature, the Sick shall be perfectly
freed from all manner of danger, and in a short time become thoroughly well
again.

22. As to the Diet let it be made after this manner: Take spring Water, twenty
five quarts: Mealy Sarsaparillae, two pounds and half: Virginian Snake-root,
Contra yerva, of each four ounces: infuse all the Sarsaparilla all Night in the
Water, over a gentle heat, the next Morning take it out, and split each string
into three or four pieces, after which boil it with the other things in the
foresaid quantity of Water for six or eight hours, or till the Liquour is near
half boiled away; at what time the Water will be of a pretty high Color; in
this Water dissolve spanish juice of Liquorice, one or two ounces: let it
settle in a proper Vessel, then decant the clear, which bottle up, putting into
each bottle a quarter of an ounce or better of white Sugar and a Clove split in
halves.

23. Of this the Sick ought to Drink a bottle or two every day; drinking no
other Liquor besides, and to continue for sixty days or more, as he shall see
occasion.

24. Now here is to be noted, That if he be of a vehement hot Constitution, the
Diet as it is here ordered, is sufficient enough, but if the Constitution or
Habit of body be cold and moist, it will be necessary for him to add to the
Decoction these following things: Take Rosmary, Lavender, Sage, sweet Marjoram,
Betony, of each half an handful: Hyssop, Mint, Cat-mint, Origanum, Thyme, of
each a pugil* bruise them together, and put them into the former Decoction,
half an hour before the end of the boiling; after which dissolve the said juice
of Liquorice, strain, then let it settle, after decant it clear, and Bottle it
up, as aforesaid.

25. Now that Sarsa sweetens the Blood above all other things that we know, we
are sufficiently satisfied from manifold Observations and Cures performed by
the same; which, I may speak, were even to My own admiration; but it no ways
answers the Intention, unless as we have declared Chap. 1. sect. 5. 10. it be
long taken, and Liquor be made very strong thereof, by boiling at lest eight,
ten, or twelve times the proportion assigned by others. Thus much for the Diet.

26. We come now to show the use of the Hercules, so called, as beforesaid, in
respect of its mighty Operations; the thing which chiefly answers to this is
the Aurum Vitae Sennerti, the other the Hercules of Bovius: Lastly, the
Hercules of the Author hereof.

27. Either of these may be given during the time of the taking of the
aforesaid Diet once or twice a Week, for eight, ten, or twelve Weeks together,
by what time an eminent alteration may be seen.

28. If in the mean season the Body be bound, you must take Care that it be
opened with some Emollient Clyster, among which that of Joel is not Improper:
Take Beets, Marshmallows, Herb Mercury, Rue, Bay Leaves, Nettles, of each one
handful: Roots of Polypody, one ounce: Bark of Broom, Carthamus-seeds, flowers
of Staechas, Camomil-flowers, of each one pugil: cut them that are to be cut,
bruise them that are to be bruised; boil them in a sufficient quantity of Water
to the consumption of the half: strain, and to a pound thereof add juice of
blew Flower-de-luce Roots clarified, one ounce: Hiera simple, half an ounce:
Oils of Rue, Castor and Dill, of each one ounce: Honey of Roses, half an ounce:
Salt, one dram: mix and make a Clyster, and let it be given in the Morning
fasting.

29. After due Purging, you may safely Sweat with the Solar Bezoar, and other
things, three, four or six times. But among the number of the great Specificks
proper against this Disease are accounted the Pilulae Lunares, which may be
given to three or four grains, and that constantly of themselves, or else
alternately with other specific Medicaments, as those of Sennertus and Bovius
aforenamed: to which add also the Vitriol and Tincture of Luna.

30. To the external parts of the Head may be applied this following Liniment:
Take Oil of Rue, one ounce: Mithridate, Venice Treacle, of each half an ounce:
spirit of Juniper, in which a little Camphir is dissolved, a sufficient
quantity: mix and make a Liniment to anoint the Temples and parts pained, the
Hair being first cut off; also it may be spread upon Leather, and applied to
the same place.

31. Lastly, From Joel, we add the following thing, which he says is an
Experiment often tried: Take Juyces of Elecampane and Briony, Liquid Storax and
Turpentine, of each one ounce: Gum Elemni, half an ounce: Frankincense, Orrice
Root, of each three ounces: Oils of Orrice and Hypericon, of each a s^fficient
quantity: make an Ointment thereof, with which mix Quicksilver killed with
Man's Spittle, one ounce: mix all well together and make an Ointment according
to Art: and let those parts of the Arms where the Cephalic Vein is extended be
anointed every day for many days together. We here communicate it to others,
that they also may make Trial thereof.

XXXIX. The Cure of the Headache proceeding from a hurt of the Cranium, or the
Men^ngs of the Brain:

1. In this Case when a pain of Head comes, after the Healing of a Fracture in
the Skull, or a Wound in the Dura Matter; Physicians have often applied many
Remedies, but all in Vain: and although the Pain has been eased for the present,
and the Sick seems to himself to be well, yet upon the least Illness,
Indisposition, or change of Air, the pain has still constantly returned again
and afflicted the Patient in the same place and after the same manner; so that
notwithstanding whatever Physicians have been able to Prescribe, it has, as it
were, remained Unconquerable.

2. But there are some Natural Indications, which if rightly used will not fail
of the Cure, or desired Effect. Now the reason, why the pain constantly returns
upon any sudden change or alteration of the Air, is this:

3. The Animal Spirits in the Brain being only recreated and comforted by a
clear, and sereen Air and their being a reciprocal kind of sympathy and unity
among them by reason, of the purity, celerity, and subtilty of parts, it comes
to pass that always some hours before the said alteration happens, the said
Animal Spirits begin to be clouded and oppressed, and by reason of their
endeavor to free themselves there from by their extreme hastiness and rushing
together they make a Collision amongst themselves, by which the Pain is excited.

4. But that this should come to pass some hours before the said change of
Air, yea sometimes a day before hand, that is the great Wonder. Truly this
arises from the sensibility of the parts afflicted, and exceeding subtilty of
the Animal Spirits (mutually Sympathizing with the Nature and quality of the
Air) who can for many hours before hand perceive and feel that which we cannot;
for as much as it is certainly to be believed that many hours before the
actual Change of the Weather, the air has received the impression, or
prae-disposition of the said succeeding Alteration, though no such thing be
manifest to us.

5. Whether this Pain be old and of long standing, or not; if that indeed it be
extreme, we must come also to the Extreme and last Remedy first, without which
all others will prove ineffectuall as to a perfect Cure.

6. The Skull ought to be opened, and a piece taken out either upon the place
where the former Wound or Fracture was, or rather if the place will admit it, a
little below the same and from thence forth to be kept open so long as the
person Lives; for being healed and so kept it endangers incurable Megrims,
Vertigoes, Epilepsies, or Apoplexies, by which the Sick is many times suddenly
carried of: Whereas being kept open, those Fumes or Vapors which may be the
Cause of the said Diseases, as also of this present Pain, are continually
breathed forth.

7. What remains now, but that the Belly be kept soluble with proper Clysters,
and the Stomach opened and cleansed from its impurities, which commonly in
Bodies so disposed send up Vapors and Fumes to the Brain.

8. The Clysters: Take Decoctum Commune, fourteen ounces: Oil of Camomil, two
ounces: Cassia extracted, one ounce and half: Salt, one dram: mix and make a
Clyster, which exhibit in the Morning fasting.

9. The Stomach may be cleansed with this: Take Yellow Myrobalans, two drams:
Rhubarb, four scruples: Spicknard, half a scruple bruise and moisten them, with
Wormwood Wine till they are soft; then infuse them in clarefied Whey, or Endive
and Vervain Waters; strain out, and dissolve therein, Diaprunis, two drams:
Syrup of Violets, an ounce: give it for one dose. Or instead hereof, you may
take the Decoctum Senae Gereonis, to six ounces: which is a thing of good use.

10. If the Sick had rather take Pills, he may use those of Assajereth, which
are good for a Headache proceeding by consent from the Stomach, as also Pil.
Sine quibus, a dram at a time of either; but no ways inferior are Our Family
Pills with Aloes.

11. Lastly, to strengthen and comfort the Stomach and Animal Spirits, every
Night going to Bed, the Sick may take half a dram: or a dram, of good
Mithridate or Venice Treacle; by observing these rules, it is possible he may
preserve his Body at Ease, and also in Health.

12. If the Wound be recent and so not yet healed, this following may be
applied to stop the bleeding: Take Meal of Beans, Lentils and Barley, Sponge
burnt, of each one dram and a half: Sanguis Draconis, Frankincense, Myrrh,
Aloes, of each one dram: Cobwebs, two drams: Powder of Gum tragacanth, two
drams and half: Hares-hair cut small or poudred, three drams: Terra sigillata,
Gypsum, of each one Scruple: make all into a fine powder. When you Use it, take
thereof one ounce: mix it with the Whites of two Eggs, and the Juyces of
Comfrey and Knotgrass, of each half an ounce: and apply it with Lint or Hards
of Flax.

13. This Vulnerary Emplaster may also be applied: Take Betony, Marjoram,
Hypericon, Woodbine, Yarrow, of each a handful: Rosemary, Sage, Centory the
Less, Pimpernel, Vervain, Comfrey, of each half a handful: bruise all
together: digest eight days in generous Wine, three pints in a warm place; then
add venice Turpentine one pound and half: Oils of Roses and of Hypericon, of
each five Ounces: Oil of Mastich, one ounce and half: boil to the Consumption
of the Wine, then strain strongly out by pressing; and add again Resin of the
Pine tree melted, Gum Elemi, of each three ounces: white Wax enough to make an
Emplaster, or Cere-cloth; which spread upon Linen Cloth, and apply it twice a
Day fresh to the Wound.

14. And with these Remedies you may also happily cure a Contusion or bruise,
by first opening the Tumors if any be, mundifying it with Honey of Roses, and
then applying of these Medicaments.

15. If the Dura Matter is hurt, you may instill by the fracture clarified juice
of Calaminth; or the Chemical Oil of Mastick: Or this following Liniment: Take
fresh Butter never Salted, Or sweet Hogs lard; Oil of Roses, of each half an
ounce: Chemical Oil of Mastick, two drams: melt and mix them together; and
instill thereof into the Wound, it immediately eases all the Pain.

16. If the Headache comes from the ill shape of the Head, as Absence of a
Suture, as the Sagital: Or rocky constitution of the Skull above the said
Sagitil, it is Incurable, unless by the help of the Trepan, a piece of the
Skull be taken out, that the fuliginous Vapors causing the Pain may transpire.

XL. The Pathology of the second Kind of Headache, called old or Inveterate; and
first of the Signs and Cause.

1. The Name. It is called in Greek (...), in Latin Cephalaea, and Dolor
Capitis inveteratus; and in English an Inveterate, Old, Continuing or habitual
Headache.

2. It is known by paining both sides the Head, and for the most part the whole
Head, in which the Pain is almost continual: sometimes it is gentler, sometimes
stronger, and sometimes it is with that Vehemence, as to induce a lightness of
Head, Foolishness, or a Phrensy; there is commonly a remision of it, and it
returns by fits, which are ordinarily at certain Days, or Weeks, Morning to
Evening; or accidentally from any Violent Motion, or Exercise, or taking of
Cold; or before a Change of the Air.

3. The parts afflicted in this are the same with the former, viz. the
Membranes of the Cranium, or the Menings of the Brain; and also the Brain it
self. Now the substance of the Brain becomes Sensible of Pain, only by reason
of the community of the tender films with the Menings, which produce the
Sensitive Nerves; so that if the substance of the Brain is afflicted it is by
Consent, and the Pain is only a kind of heaviness, or sense of Weight before
and behind.

4. Some of the Causes of this Pain, may be all the Causes before ennumerated
in a Cephalalgia: but by reason of its stubborness* and long continuance, we
must seek for some other additionall Causes besides, which may indicate such an
Inveteracy.

5. The one of these Causes may be a Fracture of the Skull, with hurt of the
Menings formerly Healed. Another may be from the Evil conformation of the parts
of the Head from the very Birth, such as I saw in the Skull of a Man opened
after his Death, who had been troubled with a perpetual Pain of his Head from
his Cradle, viz. an extuberance of the Inner Table, or a swelling out of the
Concave part of the Skull, much like a half Egg cut long ways, which Tumor or
bunching out of the Concavity I conceive pressed much upon the Menings. Another
may be from the Malignity of the Pox, of which we have spoken already.

6. But one Principal cause may be from the Aptness of the Blood in some
persons to a fermentation, where Vapors and Wind are stirred up; and by reason
of which, the Blood contained in the large Cavities and passages of the Brain
being raised, Causes a stretching of the Vessels beyond Nature: Or otherwise,
by means of the said working fills the said Cavities fuller than ordinary of
Excrements, by which the Motions and Functions of the Animal Spirits are
mightily impeeded.

7. Another Cause may be from Hypochondriack Melancholy, which being it self
along and Inveterate distemper, may be the Cause of the Continuance of such as
arise in part by consent therefrom. For sending fumes into the Ventricles of
the Brain by the continued circulation of the Blood, it naturally follows that
Pain must be naturally excited, and that almost continually, especially upon
any sudden or violent Motion or Exercise, any Grief or Trouble of Mind, any
anxious Thoughts; or any change or alteration of the Air, the reason of which
last we have largely declared in Sect XXXIX 3. and 4. aforegoing. To these
causes may be added the natural weakness of the brain from the birth, by reason
of which from almost every small Occasion, this Pain of the Head is excited.

8. Hence it appears, That the persons most subject to this Disease, are such
as are of a Cold and dry Habit of body, of which disposition are all
Hypochondriacks: and such as are of a Cold and moist Constitution, the
Ventricles of whose brains are almost perpetually filling and filled with
Recrements. If it be objected, that such cannot be subject to manifold
Fermentations of the blood because of their cold Habit of body which is an
enemy to Fermentation: To this we answer; That neither Heat nor Cold are simply
of themselves either the Material or Formal Causes of Fermentation, but only
an Accidental Cause, which are stirred up accidentally from the fit or
convenient mixtion of proper Salts: this Spirit of Vitriol, and a solution of
Salt of Tartar in fair Water (or fair Water it self) although they are both of
hem externally Cold, and also Cold in their operation, yet, being mixed together
in a fit proportion, they excite a most incredible heat, which may be said
indeed to be the Accidental Cause of the Effervescency, and the same may be
done in Our bodies, although Cold and Moist, if that Humidity meets with a Salt
proper for such an Operation.

XLI. The Prognostics of a Cephalaea, or Old Headache.

1. This Disease if it has not been of long standing, is the more easy to be
cured. but if it has been of any long standing, it is commonly very difficult.
So also if it proceeds from the French Pox.

2. It is scarcely ever Cured, if it follows after a Fracture of the Skull; or
be caused by evil Conformation of the parts; or proceeds from a pure and
natural or haereditary Weakness of the Brain, unless that the Skull be opened,
and a piece thereof taken out.

3. And as it, for the most part, happens either to people of a cold and dry
Constitution, of a Melancholy habit: Or to such as are of a cold and moist
Constitution of a Cachectical habit; So in both these Conditions the Cure
cannot but be very difficult: for in the first cause, the Melancholy habit must
be altered, else you do nothing at all, and that is no easy thing to do: and in
the latter the Cold and moist habit must be removed, if you perform any thing,
which is a matter of no small moment.

4. If it proceeds from consent of other parts, you must alter their Habit and
Constitution; for till the Cause be taken away, the Effects can never absolutely
cease: And according to the difficulty of altering the nature, qualities and
disposition of those parts, such will be the hopes of Cure in this Disease.

5. If it be complicated with any other Disease, as, a Cough, Catarrh, etc. the
Cure will yet be so much the more difficult, for till they are removed the
Cephalae can never be Cured: because, it is certain, that those Concomitants
contribute mightily to this Disease.

6. That which proceeds from a Fermentation of the Blood is the most easy of
this kind to be Cured, for upon the stopping of the Fermentation the pain not
long after ceases: But then this falls out again, that if the Fermentation is
renewed, so will this Pain be also.

XLII. The Cure of a Cephalaea, or old Headache in a cold and dry Constitution
of Body: or, arising from Melancholy.

1: If it be in a cold and dry Habit, from a simple Intemperature, without
Cause from any other part, the Cure will not have that difficulty in it, as if
it proceeded from Melancholy. In this Case you are to warm and humect the
parts: Take Oils of Camomil and Bays, of each half an ounce: Oil of Nutmegs by
expression: mix them well together, and anoint very well all the places pained,
Morning Noon, and Night, before a convenient Fire; embrocating the parts also
at the same time.

2. Inwardly also ought to be given things which heat and humect the parts: as,
Take choice Canary, a quart: spanish juice of Liquorice, one ounce: dissolve it
therein, let it settle, then decant the clear, and let the Sick take thereof
every day, Morning, Noon, and Night; it is a specific in this Case; for the
constant use hereof for long time does admirably warm, comfort and moisten the
parts, and indeed alter the whole habit of the Body.

3. If the season of the year will admit, it may be drank with equal parts of
Juice of Strawberries, or Juice of black Cherries, the last thing is marvelous
for this purpose: The Wines made of the Juice of Strawberries and black
Cherries by fermentation, being constantly drank either alone, or mixed with the
Canary, as before prepared, are yet much better.

4. If it proceeds from a Melancholy habit of Body, you must use the Topics
formerly mentioned in the Cure of a Cephalalgia from cold and dryness, with the
things even now ennumerated; adding also the erradication or changing of the
Melancholy Habit, without which all things are done in vain: How this is
performed we shall teach when we come to Treat of the Cure of Hypochondriack
Melancholy, to which I shall principally refer you.

5. Yet the following things have not been used without success. Once in three
Weeks or a Month, you may Purge with Pilulae de Lapide Lazuli. Or with this
Infusion: Take Water, a pint: Sena, one ounce: Green Roots of Polypody, half an
ounce: Salt of Tartar, one dram: make an Infusion to purge with.

6. Sometimes also may be used the Tinctura Melanagoga Grulingij, which
excellently evacuates the Melancholy Humor. Some commend the Diasena Nicolai,
half an ounce at a time to one ounce: But it is thought that Confectio Hamech
given alone, from half an ounce to six drams, exceeds most other things.

7. Thus Compounded it is good for weak Constitutions: Take Confectio Hamech,
one ounce: Cassia extracted, or Diaprunum Lenitivum, or Catholicon, two ounces:
mix them for two or three Doses.

8. If the Stomach be foul, let the Vinum Elleboratum be given half a Spoonful
at a time with an ounce of Oxymel, and as much Wine of Squills, or half an
ounce of Platerus his Walnut Water.

9. In the Intervals of Purging, the Sick may constantly drink Quercetans
Decoction of an Ox-Spleen: Or, the Decoction of Crabs, taking also now and then
Wine of Black Cherries, Pope Adrian his Wine; or what is most transcendent the
Musked Wine of Mynsicht, for that Musk and Ambergrise are great Specificks
against all manner of Head-achs whatsoever: To these things you may add great
openers.

XLIII. The Cure of a Cephalaea or old Headache in a cold and moist
Constitution.

1. If the Disease be recent, and the Pain not very vehement, it may be Cured
almost after the same manner, and with the same Medicament which we prescribed
for a Cephalalgia proceeding from a cold and moist Cause.

2. However, notice is to be taken whether the Diseases be Simple of it self,
or conjoined with any other; as this is for the most part with the Scurvy, in
which latter Cause, that we may here speak once for all: What Medicaments
soever we shall prescribe for the Cure of a Cephalaea, are always to be mixed
with such things as are proper against the Disease Concomitant; for otherwise
you will always miss of the end.

3. As Antiscorbuticks with Cephalicks in a Scorbutic Cephalaea; Hystericks
with Cephalicks, in an Hysteric Cephalaea; Melanagogues with Cephalicks, in a
Hypochondriach Cephalaea; Carminatives with Cephalicks in a windy Cephalaea,
etc.

4. This being understood, we are to consider, whether the Pain be without the
Skull or within, if without the Skull, discussive Topics are first to be
applied, such as Bread hot out of the Oven, which is to be laid on as hot as
can be endured, and it may be laid on of it self (the Crummy side next the
Skin) or moistened with Oil of Rosemary, or Sassafras, which have a great Power
both to discuss and ease pain, and this thing ought to be often repeated till
such time as the pain is apparently mastered.

5. But if so be that by this means no ease can be procured, the Hair ought to
be Shaved off, and this following Cataplasm to be applied: Take ordinary
household Bread, a pound: Oil of Roses, or of Poppies, four ounces: Extract of
Opium, half an ounce: mix them, and apply them warm.

6. The Pain being by this means eased, let the Hair be Shaved off from all
those places where the Pain is; or, if you please from the whole Head and let a
Blistering Plaster be made of the common Vesicatory of the Shops, strewing
thereupon Cantharides in powder moistened with Vinegar; or, a Vesicatory may be
made by mixing a sufficient quantity of Powder of Cantharides with sour Leaven,
and apply it after the manner of a Cataplasm; the Blister being drawn, the Skin
is to be taken away, and it ought to be kept running by the Application of
Emplastrum de Meliloto.

7. When it is healed, after some few days, this work ought to be repeated
again, at least three or four times; and whereas it is a stubborn and
rebellious Disease, of very difficult Cure; so there ought to be an
unweariedness of Mind in the application of Remedies, and they ought to be such
as have a certain power and force to take away the Disease even by the Roots.

8. The application of the Vesicatories being over, that we may derive from the
Fountain, and prevent (if possible) a new return of the Pain. Errhins ought to
be used or a Sternutatory of great Power, such is that of Deckers made of
Turbith Mineral and Powder of Liquorice; for that makes such an ample
evacuation, being but twice or thrice used, as would be beyond belief to be
expressed in Words.

9. Inwardly you may Purge the Body with Our Family Pills without Aloes, and
with Pilulae Lunares, which may be given alternatively for three or four times.

10. If there be a foulness of the Stomach, the Sick may take the Vomiting
Syrup of Sala, or the Emetick Tartar of Mynsicht from three grains to six.

11. Outwardly the Coronal Sutures, and indeed the whole Head may be anointed
with Oil of Amber twice a day, or bathed three or four times a day with the
Powers of Rosemary, or Amber, or both; which being used for eight or ten days,
let the Sick apply over the whole Head, being fresh Shaved Emplastrum
Cephalicum, to comfort and recreate the Brain and animal Spirits, and to
perfect and confirm the Cure.

12. The Sick all this while, constantly smelling to and taking up the
Nostrils, Powers of Rosemary, of Sassafras, or of Oranges, because they not
only comfort the Brain, and restore the profligated Spirits, but also mightily
heat and dry all the parts of the Head and Brain, whereby the Conjunct Cause is
prevented.

13. If the Pain be within the Skull, we must begin with inward Medicaments, to
wit, such as may make a strong Derivation: Take Sulphur of Antimony, four
grains: Rosin of Jallap, five grains: Tartar Emetick, one grain: mix, and give
it in Conserve of Roses or Violets, it Vomits well.

14. If the Disease be inveterate and very stubborn, Take Turbith Mineral, four
or five grains: Confectio Hamech, a dram and half: mix them, and give it with a
good Government. Or, Take Griphus Mercurij, four grains: Resin of Jallap, five
grains: Conserves of Rosemary, or Betony-flowers, two drams: mix them for a
Dose. Or, Take Scammony, ten grains: Crocus Metallorum, four grains: Tartar
Vitriollated, sixteen grains: mix them for a Dose, it evacuates notably and
strongly, and with a great deal of vehemence, yet safely. Or thus: Take Tartar
vitriolated, a scruple: Scamony, twelves grains: Cambogiae, six grains: Crocus
Metallorum, four grains: mix them for a Powder for one Dose: it mightily
evacuates cold, moist, pituitous, and watery Humors from the Head.

15. But in more delicate Bodies where such strong things as these cannot be
given, you may purge with this following: Take Pilulae Aleophanginae, Pilulae
de succino, of each half a dram: Resin or Jallap, seven grains: Oil of
Lavender, five of six drops, make all up into a Mass of Pills, for two Doses.

16. Dr. Willis prescribes this following Powder: Take Diagridum, ten grains:
Ceruse of Antimony, fifteen grains: Cream of Tartar, eight grains: mix them,
and make a Powder to be taken early in the Morning.

17. If these things do no good, there is a necessity, that we come to our last
internal Remedies, which are Pilulae Lunares before mentioned, the Hercules
Bovij, and the Aurum Vitae Sennerti, of which the first two, or all the three
may be given one after another alternately, with a due interval between each
Dose.

18. If the Belly be bound, or subject to be Costive; let this following
Clyster be administered: Take Milk, a pint: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, four
ounces: common Oil of Camomil, three ounces: Oil of Aniseeds, half a dram,
Benedicta Laxativa, two drams: mix and make a Clyster to be exhibited warm with
a Clyster Syringe.

19. For other derivations, the Errhines and Sternutatories before mentioned
may be used with good success, and Cauteries either Actual or Potential may be
applied to the Soles of the Feet, for that by the Authority of Zacutus
Lusitanus, they derive from the Head wonderfully, and sometimes Cure beyond all
Immagination, even where the Patient has been left as it were without remedy
and hope.

20. Outwardly, the Head may be anointed with choice, spirituous, and volatile
things; as Cephalic Oils and Balsams, which being done for some few days, over
the whole Head may be applied Emplastrum de Saponis either alone of it self, or
mixed with a half part of Emplastrum Paracelsi.

21. If these things prevail not, you ought to apply Vesicatories, as we have
taught in the former Section; after which Narcoticks may be inwardly given, or
outwardly applied.

22. The Paroxysm being over, and the Pain eased, as also the original Cause
being taken away by proper Revulsives and Derivatives: it remains that we show
now how to strengthen the parts; viz. as well all the Internal Viscera as the
Brain, its Vessels and Teguments, that by the confirming them in a healthful
Tone, we may prevent for the future a new return of the Disease.

23. And in the first place, all those things are to be avoided, as Food, which
create, or breed, cold, moist and pituitous Humors; the Sick ought to abstain
from too much Drinking, Gluttony and Sleeping in the Day time; his Food ought
to be made of things heating and drying, his Bread ought to be Biscuit, his
Drink a small Decoction of Guajacum with Carminative Seeds, taking also now and
then to comfort the Spirits and Animal Faculties, a glass of generous Wine or
Hippocrass.

24. The Wine of Pope Adrian is here of mighty use, so also the Vin. Sanctum,
the Vin. Cephalicum, the Vinum Claretum Stomachicum the Vinum Stomachicum Mylij
or the Vinum Moschatum Mynsichti once a day, or twice a Day, as need shall
require.

25. Once a Week, or once in 14 days as need shall require the Body may be
Purged with Vinum Hydrogogum Barbetti, or the Vinum Purgans Catholicum Horstij,
or the Vinum Absinthiacum Laxativum, all which not only open the Body, and keep
the Belly soluble; but also do derive very much from the Head.

26. In an Antiscorbutick Headache, Dr. Willis commends this following
Electuary: Take Conserves of Fumitory, Tansy, and Wood Sorrel, of each two
ounces: Powder of Aron Compound, three drams: Ivory, Crab's-eyes, Coral all
prepared, of each a dram and half: Powder of yellow Sanders, of Wood of Aloes,
of each half a dram: Vitriol of Mars, one dram: salt of Wormwood, one dram and
half: with the Syrup of the five opening Roots, a sufficient quantity make an
Electuary: The Dose, the quantity of a Chestnut, early in the Morning fasting,
and at five in the Afternoon; drinking after it, one ounce or two of choice
Wormwood Water, or Angelica the greater Composition.

27. Or, this following Julep may be given to three ounces: Take Water of
Vervain, Water of Elder-flowers, of Aaron leaves, of each six ounces: Aqua
Limacum and Lumbricorum Magistralis, of each two ounces: Sugar, one ounce: mix,
and dissolve.

28. Moreover for change of Medicaments, and that the use of any one may not
become Familiar, it will be good to take sometimes Elixir Proprietatis, Elixir
Vitrioli Mynsichti, Tinctura Piperis Nigri, Tinctura Sacra, Vitriola Martis,
Hiera Picra, Pulvis Ari Compositus, Diatesseron, Pulvis Antepilepticus, species
Alexipharmacae Nostrae; and Our Magisterial Antepileptick Powder.

29. Some commend the species Diaolibani Mynsichti: species Diamajoranae, as
Mynsicht says, Cures an inveterate Headache when all other things fail; he sets
also an high value on species Diapeti used as a Sneezing Powder: For that it
cleanses the Head and Brain of all cold, moist, salt, viscous and pituitous
Humors, and strengthens the Head and Brain, whereby it becomes prevalent in
all Head-achs, Catarrhs, Vertigoes, Epilepsies, Lethargies, and other the like
Diseases, proceeding from the Obstruction of the Brain, and the aforesaid
superfluous Humors, you must snuff up the quantity of a great Pea every Night
going to Bed, about two hours after Supper; it largely draws away all evil
Humors both thick and thin.

30. This may be taken early in the Morning: Take Conserves of Betony-flowers,
and of Rosemary-flowers, powder of Male Peony-roots, and Misleto of the Oak, of
each half an ounce: Pearls, red Coral prepared, of each one ounce and half:
powder of Wood of Aloes, and yellow Sanders, choice Musk, of each a dram and
half: Ambergrise, half a dram: with syrup of Peony-flowers a sufficient
quantity make an Electuary, of which the quantity of a Chestnut may be taken
every Morning and Evening.

31. Also Tincture of Antimony, spirit of Sal Armoniack spir. de Cornu Bovis,
and spir. of Man's Skull, may now and then be taken in the Day, in a Glass of
generous Wine.

32. Lastly, if it be a Body full of evil Humors, it will be necessary, either
that the Seton be applied to the Nape of the Neck, and the Wound to be kept
open for three or four months; or otherwise, that one, two, or more Issues be
made, and be kept continually open, either in one or both Arms, or in both
Thighs a little above the Knee.

33. But Experience confirms the application of a Cautery to both the Soles of
the Feet, and to be kept running for a long time, for that they evacuate the
Head after a remarkable manner of all cold and moist Humors; and not only the
Head, but many other parts of the Body, yea sometimes even to the changing of
the whole Habit.

34. Zacutus Lusitanus propounds four Remedies confirmed by Experience, to wit,
an Issue in the back of the Hand, Horse-Leeches to the Temples, viz. ten or
twelve, that a large quantity of Blood may be drawn away, opening of a Vein in
the Forehead, and the Vein in the Corner of the Eye.

35. Herein these things are to be Noted, 1. That the Issue betwixt the Thumb
and the Forefinger, has Cured many great Head-achs. 2. That the number of
Horse Leeches ought to be large, whence comes a great attraction of the Blood,
whereby the whole Cause of the Disease is drawn away. 3. That the Vein of the
Forehead ought to be twice or thrice opened: for, that the first opening is
insufficient for the intended purpose; the same understand of the Vein in the
corner of the Eye.

36. Faelix WurtZ opened the Arteries of the Temples for the same purpose,
which Experiment he proved upon himself, after all other Remedies failed, this
thing is approved of by Paraeus, who says, It may be done without danger.

37. The Artery is opened as a Vein, and six, or eight ounces of Blood may be
taken leaping forth, afterward a convenient Bolster, and Ligature is to be
applied, which is not to be opened in four days, or a Plaster of Frankincense,
Mastich, fine Bole, Hares-hair, with the white of an Egg.

38. Botallus does also confirm the opening of an Artery for this purpose, and
says, That they do miraculously Cure old Headachs; and Riverius says, He has
Cured many desperate ones the same way, and never found any danger.

39. A Cautery sometimes upon the Coronal Suture has perfectly Cured a most
violent Headache. But Poterius says, It is confirmed by Experience, that the
Cautery will be more powerful, if applied to the Temples.

40. Lastly, says Riverius, when all other things fail, and by reason of the
greatness of the Pain, we are forced to run to Extremities, the Head is to be
Shaven, and a Vesicatory is to be applied all over it; but this is to be noted,
That sometimes the Vesicatory is to be repeated two, three, or four times,
concerning which of late I have had a notable Experiment.

XLIV. The Pathology of the Megrim, and first of the Notation thereof.

1. The Name. It is called in Greek (...), in Latin Hemicrania, and Dolor
Capitis Lateralis, and in English the Megrim.

2. The Definition. It is a vehement pain in one half of the Head, to wit,
either in the Right or Left side thereof, afflicting either the Teguments
without the Skull, or the Menings of the Brain within.

3. The Kinds. It is first, either within or without the Skull, as are the
other Head-achs: secondly, it is either gentle, or with vehemence of Pain:
thirdly, it is either accidental, agreeing in quality with a Cephalalgia or
Habitual, coming near the Nature of a Cephalaea: fourthly, Idiopathetick in the
part afflicted, or Sympathetick from consent of other parts: fifthly, it is
either Natural, as being Haereditary, or from a native weakness of the Brain,
or ill Conformation of the Bones of the Head: or, praeternatural from a
Fracture of the Cranium, or an afflux of preternatural Humors.

XLV. The signs of the Megrim, or half pain of the Head.

1. The Pathognomick sign by which a Megrim is known, is Pain afflicting one
Side of the Head, and by which we distinguish betwixt the Megrim or half
Headache, and the Pain of the whole Head.

2. Sometimes the Pain is more toward the Occiput, or hinder part of the Head,
sometimes more toward the Sinciput, or forepart of the Head, or near the Root
of the Eye on that side which is pained.

3. The other signs agree with those in a Cephalalgia, or a Cephalaea; if it be
without the Skull, the Head is for the most part so soar, that it cannot be
touched; if it be within the Skull that Soarness is wanting, and the Pain is
the more vehement.

4. If it be Accidental, it never comes but upon extraordinary occasions and
accidents; but if it be Habitual, it returns either at set Periods of time, or
keep an uncertain irregular Course, being excited without any apparent Cause,
continuing long, and that with vehemence almost to Distraction.

5. If it be Idiopathetick, for the most part all other parts of the Body are
found and well; but if it be by Consent from other parts, the parts
sympathizing are afflicted with some previous Symptom or Disease.

6. If it be Haereditary or from a native weakness of the Brain; the Paroxysm
is stirred up, even upon the very least occasion.

7. If it be from a bad Conformation, there is for the most part a continual
dull pain, with scarcely any Intermissions.

8. If it be from a Fracture of the Skull, it is known by that accident going
before, and the Pain constantly upon the return of the Paroxysm afflicting the
same place.

XLVII. The Cause of the Megrim.

1. The general Causes of this Disease are the same which we assigned to be the
Causes of the other Headachs, and therefore are needless to be repeated here.

2. The particular Cause of the internal Pain, is from its beginning at the
beating of the Temples, and going to the Sagital, or Arrow-like Suture,
dividing the Head long ways; for that both the Tunicles are distinct with the
Brain long-ways in the middle of the Skull, the Brain being divided laterally
by a kind of Septum.

3. So that it comes to pass, that if the first rise and prime motive of the
Disease, be on both sides, that both halves of the Head are pained; but if on
one side only, then only one half of the Head is pained, which is the true
Cause of the Megrim.

XLVII. The Prognostics, or Judgments of the Megrim.

1. If it be without the Skull, or accidental it is easy to be Cured, so also
if it be gentle and not vehement, and the pain stays no long time.

2. If it be inveterate, vehement, the Paroxysm of a long continuance, and its
return again speedy, after a few days, the Cure will be very difficult.

3. So also if it rises from a Melancholy Habit, or from a Fracture of the
Cranium, or of a cold and moist Temperature.

4. If it be Haereditary, or from a native weakness of the Brain, or from an
ill conformation of the parts of the Head, the Disease is for the most part
Incurable.

XLVIII. The Therapia, or Method of Cure.

1. The Cure of this Disease differs but a little from those of a Cephalalgia
and a Cephalaea; for according to which of them it comes nearest, so you must
direct the Intentions of Curing; and to which places we shall principally refer
you.

2. However these following things are to be observed; first, that the Belly be
kept always soluble, and if the Sick goes not once or twice a day to Stool,
that sharp Clysters be given, made of Mutton Broth, Oil, Infusion of Crocus
Metallorum and Confectio Hamech; for that they notably derive from the
Superior parts.

3. And that the disposition of the Bowels, may be Laxative, these following
Pills may be given: Take Pilulae Hiera simple, one dram: Pilulae Arabicae, a
dram and half: yellow Myrobalans, half a dram: Rhubarb, two scruples:
Spicknard, ten grains: make all into a Mass of Pills with syrup of Staechas; of
which two scruples or more may be taken early in the Morning, or presently
after Midnight.

4. If the Constitution be cold and moist, and abounds with many pituitous
humors, these Pills following may be given: Take Pilulae ex duobus, a dram and
half: Resin of Jallap, half a dram: Oil of Lavender, or of Rosemary, twelve
drops: make Pills, and let twenty five grains be given at a time, or more.

5. Or, in place hereof, the constant use of Pilulae Lunares, once a Week, for
a quarter or half a year together is to be admitted.

6. If from the constant use thereof, the Sick shall be in danger of a
Leucophlegmatia or Anasarca, which is a certain kind of Dropsy, the use of the
said Pill is for some time to be forborne, and the Viscera are to be comforted
and strengthened by giving a dram, or a dram and half of Venice Treacle, for
three or four Nights together, going to Bed; after which the use of the Pill
may be repeated as before.

7. Secondly, If it be by consent from other parts, that you have always a
respect to their affections; if there be a weakness, foulness of Stomach, want
of Digestion, Loathing, Vomiting, or a pain at the Stomach, you ought to give a
proper Vomit, some such a one as we have formerly prescribed.

8. If it arises from the Womb, you are to mingle Hystericks with Cephalicks,
in this Case you may Purge with Pilulae ex duobus, mixed with Pilulae Foetidae,
or Powder of Castoreum, or Man's Skull, or Spirit or Oil of Man's Skull, or of
Hartshorn, or you may make a mixture with Assa foetida, etc.

9. Thirdly, the proper Topics are to be applied, such are Cataplasms of hot
Bread, or baked Turnips, split in the middle and sprinkled with Oils of
Rosemary, Sassafras, or Amber. Or this: Take Wild Ox, or Goats dung,
Frankincense, of each alike, with Vinegar make an Emplaster, which apply warm.

10. Afterward, That the Head be continually kept anointing Morning and
Evening, with this following Oil: Take Oil of Nutmegs by expression, one ounce:
Chemical Oils of Rosemary, of Sassafras, of Amber, and of sweet Marjoram, or
Savin, of each one dram: mix them to anoint withal.

11. Fourthly, Where the Disease is inveterate, and will be brought to yield to
no Remedies, the Hair ought to be Shaved off, and a Vesicatory is to be applied
over the half of the Head Pained, which ought indeed to be repeated 2, 3, or 4
times; after which the Soar place being Skinned, a Cataplasm of green Vervain,
Rue, and Wormwood, made by beating in a Mortar, is to be applied for many days,
Morning and Evening.

12. You may apply ten or twelve Leeches as Zacutus Lusitanus does advise, to
the Temples and Forehead on that side the pain is, which for the most part
Cures; but if these things do not, you may, says Riverius, open the Temporal
Arteries, and draw six or seven ounces of Blood, which is not only once to be
done; but also to be reiterated twice or thrice if need so requires.

13. And it will not be amiss, if a Cautery was applied to the Coronal Suture,
or rather, if it be done by a Skillful Man, to the Temple of the afflicted side.

14. Some have been Cured by applying a kind of Cataplasm made of Euphorbium,
dissolved in Vinegar, others have been Cured, by having Cauteries applied to
the Soles of both the Feet, which has been of a most incredible Advantage; the
reason of which is apparent from the great consent of the parts.

15. But as the last and ultimate Remedy, all or most of the former things
having been first tried; we must have recourse to Narcoticks, outwardly you may
bath with Tincture of Opium, and anoint with Oil of Poppy-seeds, or with this
following: Take Oil of Poppy, or Henbane seeds, two ounces: Opium extracted,
and inspissated to the thickness of Honey, half an ounce: Camphir dissolved in
a little spirit of Wine, a dram and half: mix all together, and let the Spirits
gently evaporate, with this the party afflicted may be anointed twice or thrice
a day for six, eight or ten days.

16. Afterward the Hair being close Shaved, this following Plaster may be
applied: Take Emplastrum de sapone, half a pound: Extract of Opium of the
thickness of Honey, one ounce and half: Camphir dissolved in a little Oil of
Anniseeds, two drams: mix all together, and spread it upon white Linen, and
apply it to the place, and to be renewed every third or fourth day.

17. Inwardly the Sick may take Laudanum Paracelsi, or Our Laudanum, a small
Pill every Night going to Bed, beginning first with two grains, and increasing
it every fifth or sixth day, half a grain, and so continuing the constant use
thereof, for half a year or more, except only on those days, wherein the Sick
takes some gentle Purge to Loosen the Bowels.

18. If it comes from a former Fracture of the Skull, not so well Cured as it
ought to be, then the Head ought to be opened, and a piece of the Skull taken
forth, and to be kept open all the days of the Patients Life: And through this
whole Cure, let his Drink be continually a small Diet made of Guajacum, adding
some Sarsa, Liquorice, and Carminative seeds.

XLIX Singular Observations in the Cure of a Megrim from Wind and Cold.

1. In case of flatulency or wind, the digestive Powder following may be given
every Morning fasting: Take Cremor Tartari, two drams: Foecula Aronis, Foecula
of Bryony, of each one dram: Salts of Wormwood and of Carduus, of each one
scruple: mix, for four doses: Let it be taken in the Morning fasting, in
Decoction of Parsley or Fennel roots, adding a few drops of Elixir Proprietatis
Paracelsi.

2. At Night going to Bed you may give this: Take Magistery of red Coral, one
scruple: Magistery of Lapis spongiae, ten grains: mix in a fine Powder, with a

Treacle Water, two ounces: Water of Swallows with Castor, one ounce: spirit of
Lilly-Convally, half an ounce: mix them. Dip Linen Clothes therein, press them
a little out, and apply to the part pained, using also Frictions before hand.

CHAP. III. Of the Vertigo. Numb. 10. August 27.

The Authors Observations.
I. A Vertigo in a Youth, with Dimness of Sight, called Scotoma.

1. He was a lusty likely Youth, 18 years of Age, and of a Sanguine Complexion:
this Giddiness often troubled him by Fits, but especially if at any time he
went near Water: It was accompanied with a darkness of Sight, which Disease is
called Scotoma, and is the worst kind of Vertigo; his eyes being shut, yet
nevertheless all things objected to the internal sense seemed to turn round;
this Disease thus compounded of both with Blindness is called Scotodinos.

2. The Seeing is hurt by the too much agitation of the Spirits, they being
moved either by themselves, or with the mixture of a Vapor: The Spirits are
contained in the Brain its Arteries and Ventricles, which being vehemently
moved (without the mixture of a Vapor) represents to the Imagination the like
commotion, from whence arises a Vertigo. This vehement motion of the Spirits
may spring from diverse causes, as from a hard and continued motion of the head,
long turning round, etc. wherein although the head and body rests, yet they
keep their course for a while, after the same manner, till they can rest again.
So also the head being bowed a great while downwards, the Spirits then tending
from thence upwards to the beginning of the Nerves, upon the lifting up of the
head again, the same Spirits with haste and violence going back again to their
proper Seat, stir up a Vertigo. Sometimes it may come from a motion of the
body, and vehement commotion of the mind, being often and mightily exagitated
in deep Cogitations, Passions, Watchings, Studies, etc. whence a Vertigo often
arises. Sometimes from the long seeing of a thing turned round, or other
violent motion, whether real or seeming so, as the Earth seems to be moved and
run, to such as Sail; but here it only comes to pass in such whose Spirits are
easily stirred, or in such as are disposed to this Disease, whereby occasion is
given for the Fit to seize, although the cause thereof be inconsiderable.
Sometimes a Vertigo is excited from looking down from a high and dangerous
place, in such who are not accustomed thereto; for thereby Fear being moved,
the Spirits are suddenly too much diffused and drawn back again, whereby they
are moved unequally and circularly; but this no ways happens to such as are not
fearful.

3. Sometimes the cause of a Scotoma or dark Vertigo arises from the collected
Spirits of the Brain contained in the Arteries thereof, being made more hot and
plentiful, whereby they agitate themselves, and by their unquietness cause
various motions; in this Case, a light motion stirs up the Paroxysm.

4. The Dark Vertigo is sometimes caused from the mixture of vapors with the
Spirits of the Brain; and according to the nature and plenty of Vapors, and
place from whence they arise, and to which they are carried in the Brain, and
the force of their Agitation, so is the Vertigo more gentle or more vehement;
this Vapor if it be too hot, causes also a pain of the head: If it is
troubled, colored or shining, arising from a mixture of humors and Choler,
then there are many false imaginations and representations in the mind; the
Sight is deceived in seeing Insects, Atoms, and other things which it sees not.
If it be obscured whereby Clouds, Fumes, etc. are cast before the Eyes and the
Sight is darkened, together with the Vertigo as in a Scotodinos; these though
they see nothing, yet they feel the Vertigo.

5. But how these Vapors may affect the Sight, now remains to be enquired
into; some think that these Vapors ascending and breaking forth before the
Eyes like a fume, do either deceive or hinder the Sight, because Tears are
sometimes provoked, and the eyes look red with the Vapors which did penetrate
them: but this is rather from the pricking of the sensible Coat of the
Nostrils, by reason of its communication with the Tunica adnata. Some think
these Vapors do wholly go under the eyes, penetrating even to their most inward
parts, so that intrinsically they are seen by the eyes; but for these there are
no passages to the Orbicle of the Eye; for it is so compact by reason of the
Tunica cornea, and it on every side whole, that no vapors can any ways pass
through it, and into it a Needle can scarcely be thrust, when a Cataract is to
be taken off. Others, knowing that there is no passage into the Orbicle of the
Eye but by the Optic Nerve, Vein and Artery, suppose that these Vapors first
assaulting the Brain, do thence descend by the Vein and Artery of the Eye,
whereas these Vessels only run through the Tunica adnata, and do no where come
into the Tunica Cornea, nor inward parts of the eye, for that if Blood should
enter the Eye, it by its color, would represent all things red to the Sight,
as is seen, when being extravasated, it falls upon the Tunica Cornea. Others
think that these Vapors enter through the Optic Nerve, the chief Organ of
Sight, and through that are carried as through a Pipe, from the Brain and
original of the said Nerve to the Orbicle of the Eye; but this cannot be, for
no kind of Vapors can be carried through Nerves of any kind; for that they are
not only the Channels of the Animal Spirits, but also always full thereof; and
it is against the nature of Vapors to fall downwards, unless forced by
violence, which here is wanting.

6. Truly in the midst of all these misapprehensions, We judge directly
opposite, viz. That these Vapors assaulting chiefly the fore part of the Brain,
are confounded with the Animal Spirits, wherewith the brightness of the Images,
offered to the Brain by the Optic Nerve, is rendered unequal and darkened in
many places, so that to the Brain there is offered a show of false Apparitions
and visions, confounded with the true Image of things. And that this is done in
the Brain and not in the Eyes; the Vertigo which for the most part does accost
these various Visions and false Images, does apparently show; for that the
Spirits then in the Brain are also confusedly agitated, whence follows a
turning and wheeling about, or giddiness, after which the Scotoma or darkness,
by which the patient becoms as it were almost blind, forasmuch as by degrees,
those multitudes of Vapors, do wholly obscure and enwrap the Spirits, the
which happens in that part of the brain (which is the highest, and) which gives
the original to the Optic Nerves.

7. This Disease took the youth by fits, without any other Symtoms, than what
we have already declared, by which it appeared to be truly a Scotoma; most
Physicians would have begun this Cure, with Blood-letting; but I fearing to
diminish the forces and strength of the body, advised to another course. First,
I exhibited a Vomit: Take infusion of Crocus Metalorum, six drams: Oxymel of
Squills, half an ounce: Bawm water, four ounces: mix them for a Dose. This I
repeated once a week for a month.

8. The next day I purged him with Tinctura ex tribus, which gave him ten or 12
stools: (the way of making of it, you may see in my Doron Medicum, lib. 2. cap.
7. sect. 16.) this Purge I repeated every third or fourth day, for about three
weeks time: for purgers ought to be used, in all the species of a Vertigo, if
the matter sending forth those vapors; consist in the first passages; Or, if
such an evaporation arise in the Head from impure blood, mixed with choler, as
here it was apparent, from whence these impure vapors have their Original.

9. In the intervals of purging, I ordered 8 or 10 drops of the Spirit of Sal
Armoniack to be given twice a day in this following Juleb. Take syrup of the
juice of Endive, syrup of Succory, of each one ounce: syrup of the two opening
roots, half an ounce: waters of Wormwood and Succory, as much as is sufficient:
mix and make a Juleb. At night I ordered the Pulvis ad Vertiginem Cratonis, to
be given in this following Electuary. Take Conserve of Roses and of Marjoram,
of each an ounce and half: flowers of Peony, Citron peels, Rob of Currants, of
each half an ounce: Canded Quinces, one ounce: Powder of Amber, of Coral and of
Coriander-seed, of each one Dram, Fennel and Peony Roots, of each half a dram:
Mastich, a scruple, with Syrup of the Conserve of Citron Peels, make an
Electuary: of which you may give the quantity of a Chestnut at a time.

10. As to his Diet, I ordered things which bred but few Vapors, as Fish of
gravelly places; Coneys, and such like, to be eaten with sower sauce; and in
all his Drink, that some few drops of Oil of Sulphur should be put; because all
acid things, chiefly Oil of Sulphur, not only hinder the rising of Vapors, but
greatly strengthen the Stomach, and the other Viscera, and so cool the blood,
whereby the generation of the matter causing the Scotoma is certainly
prevented: by this means the Youth was in five weeks time Cured.

II. A Vertigo arising in a Phlegmatic Habit of Body, with weakness of Sight.

1. This happened in a Man 48 years of Age, of a cold, moist and phlegmatic
disposition, who had for 3 or 4 years been at times, much afflicted therewith.

2. The Cause (from all the Symptoms that did appear) was a repletion of the
Brain, by a cold and watery humor, pituitous and serous, every where filling
the windings and spaces of the brain, thereby generating plenty of Wind, so
that when the Head was moved, the humor being stirred, and following the motion
of the Head (as we said before of the Spirits) the Vertigo would be excited,
and he complained of a fluctuation within his Skull, as he thought, for without
doubt there was great plenty of the Humor: moreover he had signs of Phlegm
abounding in all parts of the body.

3. Seeing all the preceding Symptoms, I much feared, least it should
terminate in an Epilepsy, Apoplexy, or Carus, because the Paroxism would now
return often, and be of long continuance, forasmuch as a Vertigo of this kind,
is wont to terminate in those dangerous Diseases: now this it does not by
simply cooling and moistning the brain but by the immense plenty of the humor,
the which, in such as have dyed of an Apoplexy we have found, the Skull being
opened: and Authors Report, that in some it has come forth by Floods:
moreover, I also much feared blindness, because it does often arise from Wind,
and a Fluctuation of the said humor to the Optic Nerves.

4. In order to his Cure, I considered first, that the cause ought to be
removed, which was the Phlegmatic habit of the body, and watery quality of the
blood: secondly, that the brain, and its windings might be freed from the
ventosity and humor abounding: thirdly, that the parts already afflicted and
weakened might be strengthened.

5. As to the first intention of Cure, I prescribed this Clyster: Take fat
Broth, a pint: Tincture of Colocynthis, an ounce and half: Oil Olive, two
ounces: Oil of Anniseeds, a dram: mix for a Clyster: This Clyster I caused to
be repeated every fifth or sixth day. Every morning fasting, I gave him two or
three spoonfulls of syrup of Juice of Pellitory of the Wall made with Honey,
which I ordered to be continued for six weeks. Every fourth day I purged him
with the Tinctura Phlegmagoga Grulingij, which evacuated him notably, and spent
the watery humor largely. See it in our Pharmacop. Land. lib. 4. cap. 7.

6. But that we might as well strengthen Nature, and help her in her Acts, as
altogether weaken by purging, I prescribed the Electuarium ad Tabidos, to be
taken to the quantity of a Nutmeg, in the intermediate days of purging; and now
and than to take a glass of choice Wormwood Wine, whereby the sick might be
refected and comforted: and every other night going to bed, I gave him a Dram
of Peacocks-dung in powder, mixed with Conserve of Roses and Quiddony of
Quinces.

7. As to the second intention of Cure, which was the Evacuation of the
conjoined matter, I exhibited this Errhine. Take juyces of red Pimpernel, of
Beet-roots, and of Sweet Marjoram; of each an ounce: of Fennel, Rue, of each
half an ounce: white Wine, an ounce and a half: mix them, to be cast up the
Nostrils. I also caused him often to chew this Masticatory following: Take
Mastick, two drams: Pellitory of Spain, a dram and half: Cubebs, Pepper,
Fennelseed, of each half a Dram, Marjoram, a scruple: with Pulp of Raisons and
a little Wax, make small Balls to be chewed: Then I caused the Mouth to be
often Gargariz'd with this: Take roots of Pellitory of Spain, Orrice, Angelica,
of each half an ounce: Marjoram; Sage, Bawm, Rosemary, Hys^p, of each one
handful: flowers of Rosemary, of Lavender, Staechas, of each a pugil: Nutmegs,
Mace, Fennel-seed, Carraways, Rue seed, of each a dram: make a Decoction in
Wine and Water: strain, and sweeten a little with Sugar.

8. But that I might effectually draw forth all the watery humor, I caused his
Head to be shaved, and applied over it above half way, viz. on each side; as
low as his Temples, half over the Forehead, and half way down the hinder part,
a strong Vesicatory made of Spanish Flies, which in twelve hours, raised a
mighty Blister, and drew forth a vast quantity of watery humor: the blisters
being removed, it was drawn for seven days, with Emplaster of Melilot simple,
and then healed up.

9. And that the Head, Brain, and parts adjacent might be comforted and
strengthened, I ordered him continually to take the Quintessence or Powers of
Sassafras to 30 or 40 drops every morning fasting, and every night last going
to bed, in a glass of choice Canary: and that the Forehead, Temples, and Crown
of the Head, should be daily bathed with the same; and it is also to be snuff't
up the Nostrils.

10. Lastly, that we might for the time to come prevent the noval increase of
watery humors in the Head, I ordered him often to chew Gentian root in his
mouth, viz. 3, 4, or 6 hours, every day, so long as he should live, for that it
not only brings away the root and fountain of the morbifick matter, but
prevents the danger of any future Paroxism, and by a specific quality
strengthens the stomach and brain, so that the Disease returns no more: Those
Directions of mine being followed, the man became in a short time perfectly
well.

III. A Vertigo proceeding from a fall from a Horse.

1. A young man 30 years old, in riding swift had an unlucky fall from his
Horse; where he was taken up Dead: means were used, so that after 3 or 4 hours,
he became sensible again.

2. A Physician and Chyrurgian was sent for, being searched, they found a
Contusion of the Skull, but no other kind of hurt: Blood-letting was
immediately prescribed, and repeated for 5 or 6 days: the Skull was laid bare,
and by help of the Levatory the depression was raised; after 14 days the Wound
was healed; the Physician prescribed to apply Vesicatories to his shoulders;
they also gave the sick Cordial and strengthening Apozems, and soluble Clysters
to keep the Belly open; so that in a months time he seemed to be perfectly
restored.

3. But going abroad, he found himself to be taken with a giddiness, and so
strongly that he could not stand but fall: this he bore for a season, hoping
that as he gathered strength, Nature would overcome it, but delaying to seek
for remedy he grew every day worse and worse.

4. At length they sent for me, to whom the foregoing matter was related: I
conceived that through the great commotion of the Brain, and inflammation of
the parts adjacent, many vapors were bred, because that upon the extremity of
the Fit he would be wholly Blind.

5. I weighed, That the young man was of a good habit of Body, no Disease of
late going before; nor had he at any time before been subject to this malady,
so that I could not judge the Vapors to spring from any other part, for he made
not the least complaint of any illness or uneasiness any where else.

6. From hence I concluded to purge his head, which I did effectually with the
Juices of Primroses and sweet Marjoram, in which a few grains of Gutta Gamba
was dissolved; this I did 4 or 5 times: Outwardly, the forepart of his head
was shaved, to which I applied the common Vesicatory of the Shops for 14 hours:
after 8 days the Blister was healed: I applied the said Vesicatory a second
time, and he became perfectly well.

The Chapter of the Vertigo continued. Numb. 11 August 29.

IV. A Vertigo, with a disaffected Womb, and Pain of the Spleen.

1. A young woman of about 30 years of Age, of a thin, lean pale and wan
Complexion and Melancholic Disposition, was seized with a Vertigo: she was
also troubled with deep Melancholy, sighing, Fits of the Mother, and a
disaffected Spleen: she had been married 7 or 8 years, and had several
Children: her Courses were in good Order, but pale, or not of a natural redness.

2. She applies her self to me declaring her Condition, and how that for more
than two whole years, these Illnesses had prevailed upon her: she had taken
Potions, Julebs, Pills, Powders, Electuaries, Bolus's, had been purged,
sweated, and that often times, without the least imaginable Relief:
Cupping-glasses had also been applied to her Shoulders, and at this very time
of her coming to me she had 4 Issues upon her, one in each Arm, and one in each
Thigh, little above the Knee.

3. These things fore-known, the Cause appeared to be from Vapors ascending by
the veins of the Womb, and from a disaffected obstructed Spleen; all which
meeting in a melancholy habit of Body, cold and dry, caused her disturbance not
only to be more vehement when the Paroxism was upon her, but also very hard and
difficult to cure: Her course of Diet, by her own Confession, was chiefly
Poudred Bief, Bacon, and other Salt things through the whole year.

4. I enquired whether in all this time she had ever taken a Vomit, she told
me, No: whereupon I prescribed this: Take Vinum benedictum one ounce; Syrrup of
Squils half an ounce; Fumitory-water, Carduus-Water, of each three ounces, mix
them. This she took in the morning fasting, and it was repeated three times
every third day. It wrought well both upwards and downwards, and thereby she
confessed, she had some relief: nor during this time was there any Fits of the
Mother.

5. Over the Region of the Spleen I caused to be applied Mynsichts Emplastrum
de Galbano Crocatum, and renewed it every fourth day, by which the pain of the
Spleen went quite away.

6. I advised her to Cheerfulness, and to divert herself as much as might be
with pleasant (but innocent) Company: and to use altogether a fresh kind of
Diet, and food light of Digestion: and, that her Sighing might not always
prevail upon her, I prescribed the following to be taken 4, 5, or 6 times a day
in a Glass of Canary, or other wine she liked best. Take Tincture of Antimony
(drawn with rectified Spirit of Wine according to Basil) eight ounces: choice
English Saffron, three drams: Cocheneel in fine Powder, two drams: digest 12 or
14 days, and decant the clear liquor, which keep in a Glass bottle close stopped
for use. Of this she took a quarter of a spoonful or more, as aforesaid, as
occasion required, by means of which her sighing went away, and she becam more
facetious in company than formerly.

7. Now by reason I apprehended there was an exceeding foulness of the womb,
from which filthy Vapors ascended, and which was indeed the chief cause of all
her ilness, I conceived, That all that ever we had done was in vain unless that
was rectified, and that her melancholy and evil disposition would return again:
Hereupon I gave her what I have found to be a Specific in this Case, and than
which I know no better thing to purge and clease the Womb. Take Pulp of
Colocynthis cut small and freed from the Seeds, one ounce: Zedoary, half an
ounce: spirit of Wine, half a pint, infuse and digest twelve or fourteen days,
decant, and keep the Tincture in a Glass close stopped. Of this she took a large
spoonful at a time in the morning fasting about 6 days after the aforesaid
Vomits: this was repeated for 5 or 6 times every fourth or fifth day, according
as the strength and convenience of the Patient would permit: after the taking
of the Dose, the sick took mutton or veal Broth, and it wrought excellently
well with her, and gave her sometimes 6, 7, or 8 stools a day. After the taking
of this Tincture, she confessed that she had certain breakings out upon her in
several parts of her body, which had been of 3 or 4 years standing, which by
the use of this last Remedy died away, and wholly vanished.

8. Two or three days before the time of her courses flowing, I gave her the
blood-red Tincture of Gum Guajaci made with the rectified Spirit of Wine, of
which she took a Spoonful in a glass of Renish wine in the morning fasting, by
which means her Courses were both more orderly, and purely red.

9. During the whole progress of this Cure, she had the Fits of the Mother but
once, having them before 2 or 3 times a week, and sometimes oftener: However, to
secure her against a Relapse, I ordered her to continue daily for a month or
six weeks, the taking of the aforesaid Tincture of Antimony impregnated with
the Tinctures of Saffron and Cochenele, at Sect. 6. above: and every morning
and evening, for the same length of time, to take the Salts of Hart-horn and
Amber mixed in equal proportions, to the quantity of six or eight grains, the
which she did, and became perfectly well: During this Course, I ordered the
drying up of her 4 Issues, upon which she found no Inconveniency.

10. Here is one thing more to be noted, that upon her taking the Tincture of
the Colocynthis above described, there came a thick, black and foetid matter
from the Womb, and of a very viscous quality, sticking when nearly dry almost
like Birdlime:

V. A Vertigo in a Child five years of Age.

1. This Disease so Vehemently vexed the Child, that the Parents thereof could
not trust it to go alone any where, for it would seize it upon sometimes 3, 4
or 5 times a day: the child thought every thing to turn round, then he would
begin to staggger, and, if no body was near him, presently fall down; nor, in
the fit, could he tell where he was.

2. I ordered an Errhine to be made of the Juices of Sweet Marjoram and Beets,
in which was dissolved a few grains of Cambogia: this was cast up the Child's
Nostrils, by which means he evacuated a large quantity of cold, slimy and
pituitous matter: it was thrice repeated in six days: upon the seventh day the
Child bled naturally and freely at nose, to the quantity of 4 or 5 ounces of
blood: and from thenceforth he was perfectly freed from his Distemper.

3. However I ordered him to take the Powers of Rosemary to 6 or 8 drops in
choice Canary for a Month together.

VI. A Vertigo in an aged man.

1. The sick was about 70 years of Age when this Vertigo first began to afflict
him, and had now troubled him about an year and a half or more: all things
seemed to him to turn prodigiously fast round, for a season: at length his
sight failed him: but when the Paroxism was over, he would be merry and
cheerful again, and eat his food with a very good stomach.

2. The Disease every day growing more tedious, and now afflicting him once or
twice a week, whereas it formerly came but once a fortnight, or once a month,
it made them look-out for Cure: several famous and learned men were sent for,
great Advice was given, and much means used, but all in vain: so that finding
no Remedy by his Physicians, he gave them over.

3. Not long after he was seized with another fit; and toward the end of it,
with a violent burning Fever, a great Palpitation at Heart, and a great
trembling all over his whole Body, sometimes fainting away: I was sent for, and
found him in this Condition, which Symptoms I esteemed to be no less than
mortal. My Advice was desired, but I was unwilling to meddle at all: Whereupon
a Chyrurgian was sent for.

4. The Chyrurgian being come, and viewing the sick, He told them presently,
That the Patient was to be let blood, if so be that they would save his Life,
and, that there was no other Remedy left: I opposed, showing that it was not
his blood which offended in quantity, but rather a certain kind of humidity in
the Ventricles of the Brain, and that the Blood was only hurt in its quality,
by the predominancy of some luxuriant Salt, whereby a fermentation being raised
in the blood, a Fever was forthwith excited, together with those other
dangerous Symptoms.

5. Hereupon I delivered my Opinion, That he ought to find out some way to
divert the humidities of the Cavities of the Brain: and that some proper Medium
should be thought of to quiet the disturbed Archeus, and allay the violent
fermentation of the Blood, more especially, if it might be supposed the Patient
might live.

6. This Chyrurgian (who is now to be nameless) strongly opposed me, slighted
my Opinions, and warranted to the Bystanders the Patient's life, although
under all those dangerous Symptoms, besides his old Age.

7. Upon these Resolves the sick was let Blood, and the bounteous Chyrurgian
liberally took away from the dying man, no less than 18 ounces thereof:
presently the sick fainted, and with very much ado he was kept from a swooning
fit: I told them, They might safely give him now and then a little of Angelica
water the greater Composition, the which they did, and he seemed to be cheared
thereby.

8. The Chyrurgyan now leaves him, promising, That he would do more and greater
things for him, which would certainly restore him: about two hours after th
Patient cried out, I am a dead man, the Chyrurgian has killed me. I being by,
desired him to be patient, saying, the Chyrurgian has not killed you; it is your
Disease that is dangerous, and vehement: But however, that it would be good for
him to prepare himself and set his house in order. He now and then slumbred,
and past away the night in short and troublesome sleeps: but approaching 5 a
clock in the morning, he surrenered his vital Spirits.

9. The next morning came our Chyrurgian, nor was I much behind him; where
contrary to his Expectation, and in some measure mine, We found our late
deplorable Patient dead. I desired That the Chyrurgian might open him, which
was presently granted: It was done occordingly, and in the fore Ventricle of
the Brain, a bag of water was found as big as a small hens Egg: all the rest of
the Viscera of the three Venters being sound: and it is observable, That 2 or 3
days before he dyed, he complained of a vehement pain in his forehead.

VII. A Vertigo with a Malign Fever.

1 A young maiden, of 14 or 15 years of Age, being sick of a malign Fever,
was, in the Tenth day of her sickness, seized with a Vertigo, so that she could
not stand, but all things seemed to turn round with Violence: She had a Bubo
under her left Arm-hole, which broke and ran well; so that there was great
hopes of her life.

2. Four days after a Parotis appeared behind the right Ear, to which 6 or 7
Leches were applied: the Vertigo in the mean Season at fits, and sometimes
almost continually afflicting the sick: by the application of the Leeches, the
Tumor had Liberty to ripen and break, which by help of strong Maturatives was
perfected in 3 days.

3. All things were done in respect both to the Fever, and the malignity; so
that the Disease seemed to be conquered, only the Vertigo remainned; for the
helping of which I ordered the solid Err^i es to be applied the next day: but
alas, before the appointed time, the Patient was dead.

4. Her Parents had a Desire to have her opened, and in the former ventricle of
the Brain was a Cystis found, about the bigness of a Pigeons egg full of Water,
of a kind of yellowish green Color: the water was put upon bread, and given to
a dog, who eat the same, and in 3 or 4 hours after (having first Vomited) he
dyed.

VIII. A Vertigo in a Maiden with obstructions of her terms.

1. She was 18 years of Age, and was in the beginning of May seized with a
Vertigo, her habit of body was cold, moist and phlegmatic, and she had been
troubled with the obstruction of her Courses for more than 20 Months? so that
she sometimes Vomited blood, often bleed at nose, her Countenance was pale and
wan like death it self.

2. Application was made to me, and after viewing the sick, I found, That the
Green Sickness had seized her: she confessed, That she had eaten Oat-meal, Raw
Wheat, and such like things, for many months, and that largely, and That she
had strong longing after, nor could she be satisfied without them: upon which
followed the Suppression of her Courses, with vomiting and loathing of Food,
and this Vertigo.

3. The first thing I gave her was this, Take the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum
of Rulandus, Vinegar of Squils, of each an ounce, Carduus water, four ounces,
mix them for a draught to be exhibited in the morning fasting. It wrought well,
gave her 5 Vomits, and 7 Stools: by which both Stomach and Bowels seemed to be
well cleansed; the maid was also much more lightsom, and her head was
exceedingly eased.

4. But I knowing her Disease to be stubborn, and to proceed from a stubborn,
viscouse and tenacious humor, thought it necessary to repeat the former dose;
which was done upon the 4th day following: after this she seemed to be
perfectly well, and her preternatural Appetite to be quite gone; so that she
was u^willing to take any more.

5. Now because Colocynthis mightily cleanses and opens the Womb above all
other things; I gave her (the 4th day following the former dose) about half a
spoonful or somewhat more of the Infusion of the said Colocynthis, in rectified
Spirit of wine, which I repeated for three times every 4th day.

6. But that in all the time of Purging she might not faint, I ordered her to
take now and then in the intermediate days, a little of our Electuarium ad
Tabidos, from whence she found great refection.

7. In the mean season I was not unmindful of the distemper of her head, but
caused it to be often bathed with Powers of Sassafras, and caused her often to
smell to Spirit of Sal Armoniack, and continually to take it in all the drink
she drank, which was indeed no small benefit to her.

8. Lastly, After that all her purging was over, and it was now about the New
of the Moon, I prescribed her to take the Tincture of Gum Guajaci drawn with
rectified Spirit of Wine: the dose was a Spoonful or better, morning and night,
after which she drank a Glass of Rhenish wine and Sugar: I ordered her the
continuance thereof, til her Courses appeared, which was after the first taking
it, about 4 days: from which time she had them in good order, and remained in
perfect Health.

IX. A Vertigo in a Girl about ten years of Age.

1. Her Parents told me, It had afflicted her for about two years; and, as well
as they could guess, was caused from her long and much turning round with some
other Neighbors Children, at what time, she not having so strong a head or
brain as they, fell down.

2. The Disease came by fits, at first more seldom, afterward more often; so
that it came almost every day, and sometime twice a day; it would also come in
the night, so that she would often cry out in the midst of her sleep, That the
house was a turning the upside downward, that it would fall upon her, and she
should be killed.

3. I saw plainly, that it was caused chiefly from a windy Vapor, first stirred
up by the aforementioned Action; which upon the least motion disturbing the
Brain presently caused a fit. I twice purged her head by casting up her
nostrils the juices of Sweet-Marjoram and Beets in equal proportion, by which
she avoided a good quantity of cold, stimy, pituitous matter: I also ordered
her to eat Small Caraway Comfets, for a fortnight or three weeks together,
because they dissipate wind in the stomach and bowels: which things being done,
she was by this only means made perfectly well.

X. A Vertigo caused by a Blow on the head.

1. It was in a certain young man aged about 22. who receiving a very great
blow from his Master with an oaken stick, caused him at the present to fall
down: after he recovered himself, he seemd in few hours to be very well, save
there was some hard Tumor upon the place, and a soreness.

2. The young man thinking the worst to be over, lookd no farther, but, in 3 or
4 days time following, was taken with an extreme Vertigo, so that in the time
of the Paroxism, as all things seemed to turn round, so he himself was not able
to stand, unless he was upheld by others, or leaned against something.

3. This grew more and more upon him, so that he seemed not to be at ease in
his mind, not understanding what it should be, or to what it tended, he came to
me, and desired my Advice upon the same, having also told me of the blow he
received from his Master. Upon which I vewed his head, and upon the sagital
Suture, I perceived a Tumor, large and thick, but not sore, or in any
possibility of breaking.

4. First I exhibited to him the solid Errhines mentioned and described in the
first Chapter of this work; these were repeated five times, upon the use of
which his disease much abated, and became almost insensible to him.

5. But that I might perfect the Cure (which I concluded could scarcely be
unless the Tumor was first taken away) I caused the hair to be shaved
therefrom, and then applied the common blistering Plaster of the shops, which
drew from the Tumor a large quantity of water: upon the raw place was laid the
simple Plaster of Melilot, till it was healed, which was in about 5 days: it
having been well 4 or 5 days, I applied the Vesicatory again, and after that
the Melilot Emplaster, as aforesaid, till it was healed: by which not only a
vast quantity of water, but the Tumor was almost wholly abated.

6. Lastly, to strengthen and corroborate the part, I applied Emplastrum
Cephalicum, by which in a Months time the Tumor totally vanished, and the sick
became perfectly well: twice or thrice he was purged with our Panchymagogue
Pills to his great advantage.

XI. A Vertigo with pain of the head.

1. This happened in a youth of 12 years of Age, in whom the Paroxism would be
present upon slight occasions, and therewith an extreme pain in the forepart of
the head, and to the roots of the eyes: his Constitution was cold and moist;
and a pituitous matter afflicted the head.

2. My advise being desired, I thought it needful to evacuate plentifully the
morbifick matter or humor offending: and because there was always
accompanying it an exceeding pain of the head: I prescribed this Clyster: Take
Chicken-broth, 8 ounces; Infusion of Crocus metallorum, 2 ounces; Tincture of
Colocynthis, half an ounce; Oyl-olive, two spoonfuls; Sugar, an ounce and half;
mix, dissolve, and exhibit it warm: this was given in the afternoon: the next
morning I prescribed this Purge: Take Scammony, 8 grains; Colocynthis, six
grains; Elaterium, two grains; Oil of Lavender, one drop; mix and with extract
of Rhubarb make 5 Pills: this purged him very well, and gave him ten or eleven
stools, and I repeated it every fifth or sixth day.

3. In the Intervals, I gave him this Decoction: Take Guajacum rasped, four
ounces, Sarsa sliced, six ounces; Rosemary, Marjoram, Sage, of each one
handful: make a Decoction in equal parts of Wine and Water; strain, and sweeten
with Syrup of staechas. The taking of this for a time, corroborated the head
and Viscera, strengthened their tone, dried up the superfluity of moisture, and
altered the habit of the Body.

4. Also every morning, fasting (excepting the purging day) and every night
going to bed, I caused him to take Powers of Sassafras in wormwood-wine: this
comforted the stomach and head mightily, and by a specific property took away
the very essence of his Disease.

5. By his nostris I exhibited the Solid Errhines mentioned in Chap. 1. Sect.
3. 5. aforegoing, by which he evacuated much cold, viscous and pituitous
matter: and he gargarised with a decoction of Pellitory of Spain-root boiled in
white wind, and sweetened with Oxymel simple: the Errhines were three-times
exhibited.

6. When the fit was upon him, and the pain of his head raging, I caused hot
bread to be applied (the hair being before hand shaved off) and after the
raging of the pain was over, to be anointed with the Powers of Amber and
Saffafras mixed in an equal proportion: and to take up some small portion of
the Powers of Sassafras by the Nostrills; this mightily comforted the head and
brain, and perfectly removed his headache, so as it came no more.

7. In all his drink I caused him to take oil of Sulphur, so much at a time as
to give it a grateful acidity, and I ordered all the Sauces of his food to be
made acid with the juice of Limons: and now and then to take a Glass of Canary
with juice of Limons in it, by which the potency of the Stomach was wonderfully
augmented, fumes arising were prevented, and in a Months time the sick was
perfectly cured.

8. After all this, I ordered Elixir Proprietatis Paracelsi, to be taken 20
drops at a time, morning and night in equal parts of Canary and Camomil water,
for the space of three months following.

Observations from other Authors.
XII. A Vertigo cured by a Cautery.

1. A certain man was so vexed with a Dark Vertigo, that his Brain continually
turned round; and having tried many Remedies, and fearing that an Apoplexy
would follow, universal and particular Evacuations were made, and Issues made
in diverse parts, with a Seton fastened to the nape of the Neck.

2. But he could only be cured by application of a Cautery to the Forepart of
the head; with which Remedy alone, I have cured very many taken with deadly
diseases of the Brain, beyond the expectation of other Physicians. Zacuti Prax.

XIII. A Vertigo or swimming of the Head.

1. An honest Citizen of Lauginga, 36 years old, complained of a Giddiness of
his Head, being the Vertigo, a grievous and dangerous Disease, and which soon
turns to the falling sickness.

2. He asking my Advice, I prescribed the following for him: Take of the Mass
Pilulae sine quibus, two scruples and half: black Hellebor three grains, with
Bugloss water make all into 7 Pills and guild them.

3. This he took 3 hours after Supper, and went to stool 7 times, and presently
became better: After he had purged, the common Vein was opened, and much blood
drawn away, and so (Glory be to God the Chief Physician) he was speedily cured.

XIV. A Vertigo with Hypocondriack Melancholy and the Scurvy.

1. A Gentlewoman of Warwick, aged 46. years, was afflicted with the Vertigo,
pain of the Head, hypochondriack Melancholy, the Scurvy, beating of the Heart,
pain of the Joints, an Ophthalmia, and Morphew, and although these were
Chronick Distempers, and she almost wasted with them, yet she was cured as

8. To the Hemorrhoid Veins, Leeches were applied.

9. The Morphew which was very filthy, was removed by this following: Take
white Soap, two ounces: Sulphur Vive, an ounce: Verdigrise, a dram: Camphir, a
Scruple: with Oil of Tartar make a Ball, and moisten it with a little Vinegar,
and anoint the Face with it, and let it dry by it self; the morning after wash

XVIII. A Vertigo from Fasting and Watching.

1. Thomas Platerus my Father studied Physic, and to learn the Practice, lived
with his Wife, sometime with Dr. John Epiphanius, a Venetian Physician to the
Bishop of Basil; and studying day and night; he began to have a Vertigo so
grievously, that in the morning he could not walk without danger of falling,
except he leaned on something.

2. He asked Council of the Doctor, who said he had a Wife an Apothecary, which
could make him a Medicine. Bid her in the morning to give thee a sop in Wine to
Breakfast, go not Fasting, but sleep sufficiently.

3. This done, his Vertigo ceased, and he lived 83 years after it, and brake
his Fast daily, and eat Bread and Cheese in the morning when he was to stay in
the Schools. My Father taught Dr. Martin Borhaus, a Divine, and some others the
same way to cure themselves. Plateri Obs. lib. 1.

XVIII. A Vertigo with Pain of the Head and Darkness of Sight.

1. A Learned man aged about 38 years, and much given to Study, of a rare and
lean constitution, yet withal Phlegmatic, was troubled with a Vertigo, and
after Meat with sudden dejection of Strength; sometimes there was present a
pain of the head and darkness of Sight: his appetite was mean, his Urine well
colored, but frothy.

2. There were other Accidents from Consent, by reason of the fault of
Concoction; therefore first his Concoction was to be helped: Secondly, the Head
and Nerves were to be strengthened, and their offending Cause removed.

3. In order to which, the first passages were gently emptied with an ounce and
half of Manna dissolved in Broth wherein leaves and roots of Agrimony and
Succory were boiled: afterward he was purged thus, Take Pills of Peony, a
dram; of Amber and of Ruffus, of each a Scruple: Cephalic Pills of Fernelius,
two Scruples: with Betony water, make 15 Pills; he took 3 at the hour of Sleep,
and in the morning had three Stools.

4. These ended, he took this Carminative powder. Take seeds of Coriander, of
Fennel, Annis, Carraways, of each two scruples: Hartshorn prepared, red Coral
prepared, Cinnamon, Nutmegs, Diamoschu dulcis, of each a scruple: Species
Aromat. Rosati, Laetificans Galeni, of each half a scruple: Tabulated Sugar of
Roses, the weight of all, make a powder; this he took after meals. Dose about a
dram.

5. I appointed the following Capital Rotulae to be taken. Take Species
Diamoschu dulcis, a dram: Oil of Nutmegs by expression, a scruple: Oil of white
Amber, three drops: Ambergrise, four grains: Sugar (dissolved in Lavender
water) four ounces; make a Confect, which form into Rouls: of these he took 2
or 3 fasting, by which he found much good: after the use of these things, he
had Leeches applied, and so became well.

6. For preservation in the Fall, he used the following. Take roots of Fennel
and Parsley, of each an ounce: of Butchers Broom and Asparagus, of each an ounce
and half: Calamus Aromaticus, roots of Elecampane, seeds of Anis and Fennel, of
each two drams: Liquorice one dram: Agrimony, Betony, Maidenhair, of each half
a handful: Raisons of the Sun stoned, a handful: Flowers of Broom and Rosemary,
of each a Pugil; make of all a Decoction in water; strain and infuse therein,
in Embers for a Night, choice Sena, an ounce and half: Rhubarb two drams:
Cinnamon, two scruples: in the morning strain, and add thereto Syrup of Cichory
with Rhubarb two ounces and half: Syrup of Apples purging, one ounce: Oil of
Vitriol enough to make it tart. It was divided into two equal parts; the first
Dose gave four Stools, the other seven.

7. The humor thus prepared, he took the afore-prescribed Pills, three at night
and two in the morning, which gave five Stools: when these were ended he took
the Carminative powder aforementioned at 4. adding to it Confect. of Alkermes
two Scruples. In the morning he used the aforesaid Rotulae or Rouls, by which
means he was perfectly Cured. Cooks Observe. Cent. 2. Obs. 39.

XIX. A Vertigo in a Sheep, proceeding from an Abscess in the Brain.

1. In the year 1634. December. 24. in the Shop of Nicholas Kite, he made mention
of his Sheep, among which, one was troubled with a Vertigo or Giddiness: This
Disease, one who dealt in Sheep affirmed to be incident to the fairest of the
Flock, and that hereby their whole Brain would be turned into water, and then
they would fall down dead on a sudden.

2. The Chirurgian therefore commanded That one of these sheep which was
weakened by this Giddiness and turning round should be killd, and sent me the
head to my house, that I might open it, and diligently search into this Symptom.

3. Whereupon opening first the Skull, and looking upon both the Membranes, the
Substance of the Brain, and the first and second Ventricles, I found not one
drop of Water; and then searching into the third and fourth Ventricles, there
was also no sign of any water: but the third was filled with a great quantity
of Blood.

4. Afterward, I lifted up the Organs of Smelling, with the boney handle of my
Anatomical Knife, and on the left side, between the Brain an the Pia Matter, I
found an Abscess, like the Bladder of a fish, full of very clear water; and
near the left Eye, the Substance of the brain black; I wondered, that the Brain
it self being affected in this Disease, the Sheep should not labor rather under
an Apoplexy or Palsy, than a Vertigo. Sculteti Obs. 10.

XX. A Vertigo and Apoplexia from a Contusion.

1. In the year 1645. Jan. 25. I dissected the head of one of my own sheep
which died of the like Vertigo: and taking off the Skull, I examined the
substance of the Brain, with all its Bruisings: and presently on the left side
as it were, of the hinder part of the head, under the Dura Matter, I found a bag
of the bigness of a Fishes bladder, filled with water and little worms, such as
are bread in cheese; for it began to putrefie at bottom.

2. This coated Tumor being bigger than an hens Egg, had insinuated it self
into the Substance of the brain, that it did somewhat press upon the third
Ventricle. This sheep, as the shepherd reported, turned it self round about all
the day that she died, chiefly toward night.

3. That which happened to sheep may happen to Men and Women: I observed,
together with John Buray Barber, and Geoge Riedlin Surgeon, the same effect
in the brain of Mary Schmarkmaennen, who after a Contusion of the forepart of
the head, which I cured, for a whole year complained very much only of a
Giddiness: And one time sitting at Supper, she was taken with a Violent
Apoplexy, and died suddenly.

4. Her Parents desired me, That I would open the Skull, either for the taking
away, or else confirming the suspicion they had conceived, that one had
poisoned her. The skull being opened, and the brain being looked into, I found
a Tumor on the left side: both as to its coat, and matter contained in it, not
unlike the former, of the bigness of an ordinary Hen's Egg, and partly
compressing the third Ventricle.

5. I gave this Answer to those who demanded What might be the Cause of this
Tumor contained in a Coat, and perhaps no ill one; that the Brain being
violently shaken in that part, had contracted a weakness; and the Nourishment
flowing toward it, was converted into that matter, and not into the substance
of the Brain.

6. From hence it is evident, That blows on the head are very much to be looked
after, there being scarce any of so perspicacious a wit and judgment
whatsoever, that the disposition of the inward parts to corruption may not
sometimes escape his Knowledge. Sculteti Observe. 11.

XXI. A Vertigo not far from an Epilepsy.

1. An aged Friend of mine had a Vertigo which sudenly seized him, sometimes
before meat, sometimes after; in which, because the house seemed to turn round,
he fell; and laboring to hold himself, he scratched the Earth with his nails,
and beat it with his feet, as in the Epilepsy, only his senses failed not.

2. After his fit, he had Headache, and vomited tough phlegm; but before the
Vertigo invaded him, he complained of a heaviness and pain at his stomach. He
frequently used Pills to prevent the fit, and a simple and moderate diet: and
took a powder after meals to help his Concoction.

3. But by leaving the use of these things, he fell down in public, so that
every body thought that he had the Falling Sickness: I gave him a Vomit of
Asarum-roots boiled in Wine, and it did him good: he continued that Vomiting,
with another of the Infusion of Antimony: he vomited easily, only felt a little
Cramp in his Thighs.

4. When the Disease came again, he drank this Wine, and so never fell after,
though he had a light Vertigo, nor did he complain of it: Take Sena, two
ounces; Turbith, half an ounce; Agarick, three drams; Wormwood, two drams;
Ginger, Coriander-seeds, Centory, Marjoram, of each a dram: Pepper, half a
dram: infuse them in a quart of Wine. Let him drink it some days: he lived
sound long after, and was almost 70 years old, but on the 6 of January 1596.
falling into a Wine-cellar, he died. Plateri Observe. lib. 1.

XXII. A Vertigo that lasted many years.

1. An Italian Merchant of a good Complexion and habit of Body, in the strength
of his Age, was by degrees taken with a Vertigo, which so increased, that he
could neither walk nor sit up in his Bed: he lay night and day in Bed, and eat
and drank as if sound, and slept well, growing very fat, and so continued many
years, only the Itch troubled him sometimes: at length he fell into a Caros or
Lethargy and slept deeply and died.

2. To find out the Cause, we opened the Skull round with a Saw; and the thick
film or Meninx being cut, abundance of Water flew out: Moreover part of the
Skull separated clave to the Dura Matter, and could not be divided without
tearing of it; all the hollows and turnings of the Brain were inwardly full of
water.

3. The Vas Venosum and all the Arteries were hard in knots, and they were
swollen every where, from which we apprehended, That the water long gathered in
the head, and flowing there, was the cause of the Vertigo and Caros following;
and of the Obstruction of the Arteries: Plateri Obs. lib. 1.

XXIII. A Vertigo proceeding from Melancholy.

1. In the year 1611. A Noble Man of Burgundy was vexed with a Vertigo, loss of
Memory and Sight, in the morning chiefly, when fasting and studying, together
with heaviness of the Head, and inward Senses, with sadness and fear that
hindered all his Actions, kept him from Company, and made him love solitariness:
he had often defluxions upon his Back and Joints with pain.

2. In his Letter he sent to me, he said he had been 25 years thus troubled,
and had used the chief Physicians in all Europe, but to little purpose: he sent
me the Advises of those Physicians, and I perceived they all agreed, that it
was Hypocondriack Melancholy, among whom these following were, whom I name for
their Honor, viz. Alvarus, a Spanish Physician: Bernard Bertram of Padua:
Capalonius, an Italian: Franciscus Guiamez of Rome: Auger Ferrer of Tholouz:
Riolanus, Physician to the French King: Alexander Buchinel, Anthonius Darinet,
Anthonius Porreus and Pascotus, Burgundians, whose praescripts against
Melancholy he used from 1582. to 1602.

3. He used also diverse Evacuations, the Decoction of Guajacum, with a spare
Diet, and Sweating. The year following he used the lead Baths, and three years
after the sharp Waters of Griespake, and other things against Melancholy, as
Purgers, Vomitories, Alterers and Clysters.

4. After the use of these he was still uncured and weakened; and complained
sadly, as melancholy persons use to do, in his Letter to me in September 1608:
he desired my advice in short, and told me he was weary of many Medicines, I
answered that the Cure would be difficult, because his complexion was fixed,
being melancholy so long.

5. I promised not much, but gave gentle things as this Wine, which he never
used before. Take of the five opening roots, of each an ounce: barks of Elder
and Dwarf-Elder, of each six drams: bark of Tamarisk, two ounces: bark of
Caper-roots, an ounce: Sassafras, an ounce and half: Wormwood, Germander, of
each an handful and half: Ceterach, Bawm, Ground Pine, of each a handful:
flowers of Borrage, Bugloss, Scabious, of each two pugils: Broom-flowers, a
pugil: Fennel-seeds, an ounce: Carraway seeds, two drams: seeds of
Siler-montanus, a dram: bruise them and put them into a vessel with the
shavings of Juniper, and add fifteen measures of Wine (I suppose a measure here
understood, differs not much from a quart; some say, it is a pint and half)
stop it well, and keep it in a Wine Cellar.

6. After 8 days, three measures were drawn out, and in them were infused Sena,
two ounces: Rhubarb, six drams: Mechoacan, Epithymum, Cinnamon, of each half an
ounce: Cloves, a dram: I called the former his preparing, this latter his
purging Wine: Also I gave him some of my Troches of Wormwood. He drank the
preparing Wine, in the morning two hours before dinner, and took with it a
little Chicken Broth, for three days, and the fourth day a draught of his
purging Wine, it purged gently.

7. In the year 1609. in March he sent me word, that he liked his Wine well,
but the Gout he had made him forbear it; but after his Gout was gone, he renewed
it again thrice, and at the Vintage with new Wine.

8. In November following, he wrote to me again, after he had the Gout, that he
had an Erysipelas in his Leg, and a Fever with it, as he used: but since he
never had any Disease in his Head; and therefore desired only now some
preservatives against the Gout to abate it: I sent him my Pills and Electuary
against the Gout, that he might use them one after the other. Pills against the
Gout. Take Hermodacts cleansed, half an ounce: Aloes, Turbith, Mechoacan, of
each a dram: Rhubarb, Myrobalans Citrine and Chebs, Mastich, of each a dram:
Euphorbium, two scruples: round Birthwort, a scruple: seeds of Hypericon,
Ginger, Cummin, of each half a dram: Diagredium, half a dram: Sal-gem, half a
scruple, with juice of Ground pine, make Pills. The Gout Electuary. Take
Germander, Ground Pine, seeds of Hypericon, of each an ounce: Sarsa, round
Birthwort, of each six drams: Angelica, two drams: Betony-flowers, Cloves,
Hartshorn, and Ivory rasped, Amber, of each one dram: Coral, half a dram: make
a fine powder, and with syrup of Sugar made with Rose Water, make an Electuary.
The Troches or Tables of Wormwood. Take Nutmegs, two drams: Cinnamon, Ginger,
of each one dram: Zedoary, roots of Master-wort, of each half a dram: leaves of
Marjoram and Wormwood, of each a scruple: Pepper, half a scruple, with Sugar
dissolved in the thin Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth, make Troches or Tables.

XXIV. A Vertigo and Melancholy from a Fright.

1. One of our Senators, being naturally Melancholic, was so affrighted at the
sudden fall of an Epileptick, that he fell into a pain and palpitation of the
Heart, Vertigo, Megrim and Watching; he used many things, and the Spaw Waters,
which he had there: In the year 1596. I was sent for.

2. The 29 day of September, I prescribed this Electuary. Take Conserve of
Roses, Citron Peel candied, of each half an ounce: conserve of Marjoram, two
drams: conserves of Rosemary flowers, Bugloss, Mint, of each a dram: species de
Gemmis, Diamargariton frigid, of each a scruple: syrup of Poppies an ounce: mix
them. Of this he took a dram and half at bed time, and immediately after an
ounce of this Water: Take Waters of Cinnamon, an ounce: of Bawn, half an ounce:
choice Canary, two ounces: in which dissolve sugar of Roses, half an ounce.

3. I prescribed this Epithem for his Palpitation at Heart, to be used once in
a day: Take Rose Water, three ounces: Waters of Bawm and Lavender, white Wine,
of each an ounce and half: Camphir, a scruple: mix them. [You may first
dissolve the Camphir in a little Spirit of Wine.] After anoint the region of
the Heart with this. Take juice of Motherwort, Oil of Spike, of each half an
ounce: boil them a little, and add Oil of Cloves, half a scruple: Camphir, a
scruple: Saffron half a scruple: with Wax make a Liniment. Then apply to the
Heart this Bagg: Take Citron-peels dried, yellow Sanders, of each a dram and a
half; wood of Aloes, Spikenard, Lavender, and Rosemary-flowers, of each a dram;
Basil-seed, Cloves, Mace, Diamargariton frigidum, Troches of Camphir, of each
half a dram; make a Powder for a bagg to be quilted in.

4. Inwardly also I gave him this Wine. Take Bawm, Citron-peels, of each a
dram; Bugloss-flowers, a dram and half; Rosemary-flowers, Basil-seed, of each
half a dram; Cloves, two drams; Mace, a dram; Cinnamon, half an ounce; Sugar,
six ounces; Infuse them in Wine: give a draught now and than; after he
complained of want of sleep, I gave him every night a spoonful of Diacodium,
this did good and caused Sweat.

5. Now the Vertigo was worst, for which he took these Tablets. Take powder of
Diacidonium without species, Nutmegs, of each a dram; Eyebright, Marjoram,
Lavender-flowers, of each a scruple; red Coral, two scruples; Ivory rasped, a
scruple; with Sugar dissolved in Rose Water, make Tablets. I advised him broth
in the morning with sweet Marjoram and Mace; or a poached Egg with Carraway
seed and Salt, and he recovered. Plateri Obs. Lib. 1.

XXV. A Vertigo or Scotoma, with swooning Fits.

1. A Gentleman with a red Beard and a clear Complexion, for little cause being
Fasting, would sometimes fall into a Swooning: first he had gripings in his
Stomach, and vapors ascending, so that his sight was darkened, and he had a
Vertigo, and except he sat down he feared Swooning or an Epilepsy.

2. I prescribed for him thus: Let him eat Confections after meals, Conserve of
Roses and Quinces, and not fast long: let him eat Broths with Marjoram and
Nutmeg, or rear Eggs with Nutmeg and Marjoram.

3. After Meals, let him take one of these Tablets. Take Nutmegs, two;
Cinnamon, Cloves, Galangal, of each a dram: Eyebright, Marjoram, Lavender
flowers, of each half a dram: Diamargariton frigidum a dram: Fennel-seed, half
a dram: with Sugar (dissolved in Rose water) five ounces, make Tablets.

4. Let him take the following powder in Wine. Take Orrice roots, six drams:
Galangal, Calamus, Elecampane, Angelica, Wormwood, Ground Pine, Germander,
Eyebright, Betony, of each half an ounce: Roses, Rosemary flowers, Sage, tops
of Time, of each three drams: Carraways, Fennel, and Coriander-seed, of each
two drams: beat them into a fine Powder, a spoonful, of which steep twenty four
hours in a pint of Wine, then strain it out, and drink it for two mornings, and
afterward Broth, which continue for a Week or more.

5. In his Fit, let him eat one of these Tablets; and afterward take the same
also: Take Oils of Anniseeds and Cinnamon, of each 8 drops: Oils of Pearl and
Coral, of each three drops: mix them with Sugar (dissolved in Rose Water) an
ounce and a half, make Tablets, and drink Wine or Cinnamon Water presently
after it.

6. Let him at times use this Cordial Water. Take Bawm half an Ounce, Cordial
flowers, of each two drams, Basil seed a dram, Cloves two drams, a piece of a
Deers-Heart washed in Wine, Sack or choice Canary, a quart, distill them: of
this water and Cinnamon Water, take of each an ounce, Syrup of Juice of Citrons
half an ounce, mix them: This he took both in and out of his Fit. Plateri. Obs.

XXVI. A Vertigo proceeding from the Spirits in the Arteries, and Vessels in
the Head.

1. We have found out another Cause of a Vertigo, proceeding from the Spirits,
in the Arteries and Vessels of the Head, by Dissecting a certain Merchant, our
Countryman, who being many years sick of a Vertigo, was neither able to walk,
nor to rise out of his Bed, but he would fall down.

2. In this Man the Veins of the Brain, and all its Arteries, from their rise
and ingress within the Skull, in their whole passage through the Brain were
grown together, and become hard, distinguished with little Glandules, in their
whole progress.

3. From the Obstructions of these Vessels, the Spirits, being impeded and
retained in the Brain, are wheeled about by a light motion, and breed an
incurable Vertigo. Plateri Prax. Med. Lib. 1. Cap. 7.

XXVII. A Vertigo from an abscess in the Intestinum Rectum.

1. James Proyen, a man of a very gross body, and short of Stature, in the year
1553. toward the latter end of February, being from home, was seized on by a
Vertigo, by reason of which he supposed all things to be turned about, and
himself to be carried about hither and thither, as it were wheeled up and down,
and that in so violent a manner, that he fell to the ground.

2. Some then being near him, and beholding him thus giddy-headed, took him up
and carried him to his own home, but his Senses not at all returning to him; I
was sent for to come to him: when I came he complained of a certain pain and
palpitation of his Heart, for the abating of which Symptoms, I prescribed these
following Lozenges, when likewise he had great weakness in his Pulse.

3. Take the Species Aromaticum Rosatum, Diarrhodon abbatis, Trionsantalum,
Diatragacanthon frigidum, of each one Scruple, choice Cinnamon beaten to
powder, powder of the roots of Tormentil, Ivory rasped, Pearl prepared, of each
a Scruple and an half: beat all these into small powder, and dissolving a
sufficient quantity of Sugar, in water of Bawm, Betony and Bugloss, make hereof
Lozenges, by these means both his palpitation and pain at Heart were cured.

4. Yet notwithstanding he still continued Giddy-headed, if he turned or moved
any way from his Bed, for the Chamber seemed to him as it were turned about in
a round Circuit: two days after he complained of a pain in his Breast, but
being bound in Body and not going often to stooll, by using Suppositories, he
had a free course.

5. Then by the help of this Bolus following, he had two stools: Take of pure
Cassia six drams, Diacatholicon, Diaprunum simplex, of each two drams, powder
of choice Cinnamon one dram and an half, Anniseed beaten to powder one Scruple
and an half, mix all these together, with sugar, and make of them a Bolus. But
this pain was likewise abated by anointing his Breast from his Belly upwards
with my pectoral Ointment.

6. In the mean while there arose again yet another great pain in his
Intestinum Rectum, about his Fundament, so that he could sleep neither day nor
night; I supposing it to arise from an Ulcer in the Fundament, and he likewise
being again bound in body, having taken this following Bolus, did void, and
that with much ease, many viscous and mattery Excrements, mixed with Blood.

7. Take of pure Cassia, Diacatholicon, of each five Drams, Diaprunum Lenitivum
one Dram and an half, Agarick trochiscated one scruple, mixing therewith Sugar,
make of them a Bolus. Then to ease the pain in his Fundament, we anointed it
with the Oil of Yolks of Eggs and of sweet Almonds mixed together; but
forbearing for several days, the pain in his Fundament again increased, and he
was again bound in his body, he took therefore, twice in a day, of this Potion,
and had, every day atleast, four purulent and viscous Stoolls, notwithstanding
which, his pain yet departed not, though afterward he was never more subject
to the Vertigo. Take of Fumitory, Betony, Violets, Bugloss, Maidenhair, of
each one handful, white Beets, red Colworts (for cleansing the Ulcer) of each
half an handful: of scraped Liquorice half an ounce, choice Sena cleansed, one
ounce; Polypody of the Oak half an Ounce; Epithymum, two drams, Damask Prunes,
Number fifteen, of Raisons of the Sun stoned, of hull'd Barley, of each one
Pugil: make a Decoction in Whey to one pound, strain and sweeten it with
Sugar Candy. By the use of this Remedy he quickly became well.

8. I believe the original of this Vertigo to be from corrupt vapors, arising
from an Aposthem in the intestinum rectum, and ascending into the cavities of
the Brain. See Forest. Lib. 10. Obs. 43.

XXVIII. An old Vertigo from a phlegmatic habit of Body.

1. John Sasbot of Delf, one of the Aldermen of that Town, an old man of
seventy years of Age, being troubled with the Vertigo, as he was walking in his
Chamber, was very apt to fall to the Ground, except he stood by a Wall, or a
Table, or any other thing he could meet with to lean against, thereby to keep
on his Feet, for he fancied all things to be turned about.

2. Now although he had but a favorable Visitation with this Infirmity, and
was not so strongly oppressed therewith, as to make him fall to the ground; yet
whereas in old Men, most especially Vertigo's are Diseases the next of kin to
the Falling sickness, and those which we call Apoplexies, it was necessary with
all speed to take care for the cure of this Infirmity.

3. Being now Wintertime, and in such old men much Phlegm commonly abounds, and
he was slow in motion, heavy-headed, had a certain noise and singing in his
Ears, and was subject to sleep long together, these things argued him to be
Phlegmatic, and his Brain to be sufficiently stuffed with gross pituitous
Vapors which were easily fixed there, from whence a Vertigo might easily
follow, as being essentially fixed in the Brain, such a Vertigo arises from a
cold cause, is for the most part a furious raging one, although this seemed
more gentle, he not having as yet fallen to the ground.

4. Now that it might not arrive to that height in him, I advised a strong
Glyster to be given him, but he not being willing to admit of that, we prepared
the pituitous humor after this manner. Take of Oxymel simple, syrup of
Staechas, syrup of Betony, of each one ounce: Waters of Betony, Bawm, Hysop
(because it was in the Wintertime, and no Herbs were growing) of each two
ounces, mix them for two Doses: Then he took these Pills: Take Pilulae cochiae
of Hiera simple, of Agarick trochiscated, of each one scruple, with Betony
Water, make seven Pills.

5. Another time he took two spoonfuls of Syrup of Staechas, and Oxymel of
Squills, and for two Weeks together he took one great Assairet Pill, the which
he took a little before night, that he might take the more rest before it
should begin to work with him, for he used to sleep after it, least by stirring
and for want of sleep, its operation might be hindered.

6. I also advised him to use Errhines made of the juice of Beets, Rue and
Marjoram, which he snuffed up in his Nostrills early in the morning.

7. He likewise used Condited Nutmegs and Conserve of Rosemary, by which
Remedies he became cured, keeping to a moderate Diet, and eating such things as
were warming and drying, he likewise accustomed himself to take the Air, such
as was warm and clear, keeping out of Southern Winds, and forbearing sleep in
the day time. Forest. Lib. 10. Obs. 44.

XXIX. Of a Vertigo from a weakness in the Brain.

1. Alexander Balbian of Lombardy, in the year 1572. when in the winter time I
was walking with him in the Market, he complained to me of a Vertigo, to which
he was most especially subject in Rainy Weather, for being likewise ever now
and then seized on by a Catarrh, he was also weak headed.

2. I thereupon judged that probably he might have some hurt in his Brain,
although this Distemper might likewise be augmented from the Stomach, and the
ill habit of the Body: for, by reason of a certain distillation falling down
from the Head (both upon the Stomach and also upon the Nerves and Vertebrae)
conveyed to all parts of the Body; he had a certain universal faintness (of
which he likewise complained) together with an indisposition of his Stomach, so
that his Distemper moved as it were in a Circle; for that if once a
disaffection has been bred in the lower parts, the Brain likewise will have a
share thereof.

3. Now therefore I here judge not the Brain to be affected without the consent
of the inferior parts, nor that those inferior are affected without a
disaffection of the Brain, but that they mutually suffer by turns.

4. Hereupon I feared his Sickness might long continue, and that it might be
very difficult to cure him, especially considering his Brain and Stomach, and
the other mentioned parts were affected, in part his Liver; besides the Catarrh
under which he labored.

5. When therefore they desired to consult with me, I conceived this
Imbecibility or Weakness to come from a cold intemperature of the Brain,
because it was in Wintertime, and there present a flux of Rheum falling: so
that as I might judge that it came from a production of Phlegm, yet not without
some mixture of the choleric Humor, by which the Liver became hot, from whence
his slender and nimble Body; wherefore taking dilligent care for the cure of
this Disease, least he should be a long time in hand, I appointed him to choose
a temperate, pure and clear air, but to keep out of such an one as was misty,
thick, tempestious and rainy or snowy, and to avoid Night Work.

6. In the mean while when his fit should come on him violently, that then he
should rather choose some more obscure place to be in, that the Spirits and
Vapors which were stirred up or in motion, might the more easily be reduced to
rest.

7. In the mean time, I gave order when he went out, that he should take care
of the Winds blowing, and especially Southern; as also to avoid the light of
the Sun and Moon, and also the sight of things swiftly moved, as of the current
of Rivers, or of things moved round, as the sight of Wheels or Rundles, and
also the sight of deep places; neither did I permit him to look upwards to high
things, which were wheeled about. Lastly, that he should avoid a multitude of
Men, moving hither and thither, by a swift motion: furthermore, that he should
neither frequent the Market, or any other place, where men used to walk. But
yet there was no great need to enjoin him any of these things, he himself
confessing, that he was presently forced to leave the Market, or else his
Vertigo would easily seize upon him, and he should fall to the ground; the same
also if he should see a multitude of Men walking in a Church, for all these
things do stir up vapors to an inordinate motion, and thereby the Animal
Spirits are hurried together, that a Vertigo arises with great celerity.

8. I ordered him to sleep but moderately, not as soon as he had eaten, but at
soonest two hours after, and that he should not exceed seven or eight hours, as
likewise that he should eschew the light, that he should not sleep in a place
which was very hot, as in a Stove, nor keep his Head very hot, by reason that
Vapors were apt to arise or ascend up.

9. But I advised him to rise in the morning, toward Sun Rising, not to eat
till five hours after, and that he might go every day to stool, if possible he
could, if at any time he should be bound, or be long from going to stool, that
disaffection of the Bowels should be removed, by Suppositories or Glysters: I
wished him to use no Exercise but such as was moderate, in which I would have
him keep his head as quiet as might be: for which purpose I persuaded them to
use Frictions often, especially in the Morning before he did rise, beginning at
his upper parts and going down all along to his very lowermost.

10. If he had a mind to walk, I permitted him to do it within the house, but
to do it moderately: I cautioned him against passions of mind, or
perturbations, especially Anger, Fear and Sadness: That he should likewise
abstain from Clamors, Contentions, singing and Venery.

11. As for his Diet, I wished him to keep only to one sort of Meat, and to
shun and avoid multitude of Banquets as the Plague, and that he should
especially choose meats of a good Juice, and easy to digest, attenuating not apt
to breed wind, profitable to the Stomach and Belly, and these to be used
moderately: Then I ordered him to avoid Fullness and Hunger alike, lest
otherwise the concoctive Faculty of his Stomach should be vitiated in digesting
his Food: and I advised to the best nourishing meats, such as are Bread made of
the best Wheat and well leavened, flesh of Kidds, of young Lambs, of sucking
Calves, Poultry, Partridges, Pheasants, Birds of the Mountains.

12. From all other flesh, I wished him to abstain as much as might be; from
all Broths; from such Herbs as have vapors, Pulse, Chestnuts, all Fruits which
easily putrify in the Stomach, and send up putrid vapors into the Head: but
especially from Garlic, Onions, Leeks, Mustard, and from such crude fruits as
are used in Sallads, which yet those simple people of Piedmont and Lombardy
freely eat.

13. I gave him leave to eat such Fish as swim in gravelly places, but not
often, which if he did eat, he was to abstain from other Meats, and especially
from food made of Milk, from baked and fried meats. And I ordered him to eat
but twice a day, but to eat least at Supper; and not to drink between those two
Meals; yet at Dinner and Supper I gave him leave to drink Wine, but moderately
white and thin, not very old, lest it should strike up to his head, such is
your watery Rhenish, a little subastringent.

14. I gave him leave otherwhile likewise to drink ordinary Beer, but yet such
as wherein many hops were not boiled, for Hops send many vapors into the head;
after meals, I would have such things given him as had some astringent force, a
Pear, a Quince or a Confect without the Spices, lest Vapors should be carried
up to his head.

15. If the Vertigo should suddenly seize on him, I ordered him to have a
strong scented Medicines in readiness by him, which being held to his Nose, by
those about him, he might by means thereof be reduced. I advised likewise to
use Frictions, and to apply now and then sharp Suppositories, which are
convenient in the very accession of the Fit.

16. And as for other helps which were necessary after his Fit was over, if he
should not be able at any time to go to stool, as he ought, I wished him to
take one scruple of Aloes, an hour before Supper, now and then, but not to come
into a Custom with it, as I have seen some imprudently do.

17. For a certain Noble man continually accustoming himself to take these
Pills, was always forced to take of them each three days, or otherwise he could
not go to stool: But, by this continued use, his Liver was so inflamed and
heated, that his Face, at last, became so red and puffed up with Pimples, that
he seemed to have a touch of the Leprosy; nor could he ever have his swelling
taken down, or be cured.

18. Then lest he should be taken again with the Vertigo, I advised him to take
this Bolus: Take six drams of the flowers of Cassia, two drams of the species
of Hiera simplex, mixing sugar with it, make of it a Bolus, and take it one
hour before dinner. Afterward I appointed him this Syrup: Take of the Syrup of
Staechas, of Betony, of each one ounce and an half; of the decoction of Betony,
of Wormwood, of Endive, of Succory, six ounces; for 2 Doses. Reiterate again,
and purge with one dram of Mastic-Pills.

19 In the Spring I would have a small quantity of blood taken out of the
Basilick Vein of his right E^bow, for the heat of the Liver. Also, after the
Pills spoken of, let him chew Mastich, that water may come off the Stomach
fasting, and let him spit it out: let him put on his head a Cap quilted with
Mastick, Olibanum, Sandarack, Labdanum, and flowers of Betony, Sage and
Staechas. I advised him to take twice or thrice in a week one part of candied
Nutmeg, and to put into his ear a small quantity of the oil thereof, or a
perfume made of Cloves.

20. I wished him likewise to take fasting Conserve of Wormwood, Roses, Betony,
and Rosemary-Flowers, and going to bed to take 3 grains or 5 of pure Olibanum
or Mastick, for the strengthening of his Brain, and for the Catarrh; and always
to close his stomach after meat, I directed him to take some grains of
Coriander prepared, covered with Sugar once strewed on it.

21. When he had observed these things for some months, and had carefully
followed the foregoing Rules of Diet, he was not only cured of this Vertigo,
but also preserved ever after: so that even now, in the very year 1589. wherein
I recollected these things, he was very well. Forest. lib. 10. Obs. 45.

XXIX. A dark Vertigo, essentially affecting the whole Brain.

1. A Franciscan Monk (which they call a Vice-Guardian) at Almaria, the last
day of the Month of July, in the year 1557. sitting in the Church as they were
singing, was seized on by a dark Vertigo, at which time all things seemed to
him to be whirled round about, so that he fell to the ground; he was carried
away to his Bed thus affected.

2. I was sent for to him, but not till he had labored under this Symptom, for
four days together, and that in so violent a manner, that if he turned himself
any way, his Vertigo did quickly come on him again, and this very thing was
continual as it were, or at least without any great intermission; so that we
judged it to have taken its rise from the Brain, not from other parts: but
considering he was of a ruddy complexion, and withal had an heaviness in his
Head, always permanent in the forepart; and whereas he said, he dreamed of
Lightning, of falling from high places, sometimes into water, sometimes of
being in danger on a high Mountain; least therefore the Falling Sickness, or
some more grievous Distemper should seize upon him, I thought of letting him
blood.

3. And although he was of a rare Constitution, being in his thirtieth year, of
a good countenance, a little red; appearing of a choleric disposition, yet I
guessed he had no small portion of Blood, for he was neither thirsty, nor was
his Tongue dry, nor his Mouth bitter, but his Urine appeared a little colored.

4. I persuaded him to be let blood, but yet not on that day, whereas he had
taken Pil. Alaephanginae, which he of his own Head thought convenient:
wherefore I deferred that till the following day, and then from the Cephalic
Vein, in his right Hand near his Thumb, (for that it cold not be seen in his
Arm, nor had he ever been pricked there before) was drawn about four Ounces of
Blood, but I did not dare to take any more from him, considering he was one of
a rare or thin habit of body, had a weak Pulse, and that it was in the time of
the Dogdays.

5. After the Vein of the Forehead was opened, I applied Oxyrrhodinum thereto,
and at length I ordered the forepart of his Head and his Forehead to be
anointed with the following Ointment: Take Ointment of Populeum, Ointment of
Alabaster, of each one Ounce and an half, mix them. And I also prescribed this:
Take two handfuls of Betony, one handful of Sage, Fumitory, Borrage, Bugloss,
of each half an handful: of the flowers of Staechas, of both sorts:
Rosemary-flowers, of the Cordial flowers, of each one Pugil: seeds of Fennel,
of Endive, of Coriander-seed prepared, of each one Dram: boil them together in
common Water, to one pound strained, add syrup of Vinegar simple, syrup of
Betony, syrup of Staechas, of each one Ounce: (for there was Phlegm mixed with a
little Blood and Choler) mix them together and make an Apozem.

6. Then I purged him with these following Pills. Take of Powder of choice
Rhubarb; Pil. Cochiae, Pil. auraeae, of each a scruple: add to them syrup of
Roses infused, and make five Pills: Let him take them early in the Morning or
after Midnight.

7. Then he took twice in a day of this Condite following. Take Conserves of
the flowers of Rosemary, of Betony, Sage, Borrage, of each half an Ounce: of
powder of Peony-roots, two Scruples: (Peony is an admirable means, not only
against the Falling Sickness, but against other Distempers of the Brain,
especially cold and vertiginous, which have some affinity with the
Falling Sickness, or do easily turn to it) of the bark of Candied Citron, of
Sugar Candy, of Dyacidonium without the species, of each two Drams, of the
species Diamoschi dulcis, one Dram: of the species Diamargariti frigidi,
Diarrhodon abbatis, of each half a Dram: with syrup of Staechas and
Oxysaccharum simplex, make a Confect, of which let him take about the quantity
of a Chess Nut, betimes in the Morning: thus he was freed from his Vertigo, and
became sound again.

8. For the preventing its coming again, I ordered him to take now and then
these following Pills. Take the best Rhubarb, Mastich Pills, Hiera simplex, of
each one scruple: Castor, powder of the Root of Pellitory of the Wall, and
powder of Peony Roots, of each one Grain: mix these with Betony-water, and make
thereof five Pills. I wished him likewise to have in readiness a Condite made
of Conserve of Betony-Flowers, of Succory-Flowers, of Sage, adding powder of
Peony root, and seed of the same, with Syrup of Roses infused, and of Betony,
make a Confect. Forest. Lib. 10. Obs. 46.

XXXI. Of a Vertigo from Choler.

1. A certain man of above 30 years of Age, fell into a Vertigo, from choleric
Vapors ascending up into his Brain; which fault indeed I easily understood,
from certain Symptoms, not very obscure, for besides the natural choleric
temperament of his Body, he had such a disposition as is described by Galen.
Lib. 8. and 10 de Methodo: slender, rough skin or hairy, and quick in motion.

2. We perceived a violent heat about his Forehead, his Nostrils were dry, his
Breath hot, he was little inclined to sleep, dreamed of Fires, Thunders and
Contentions; he was indeed harsh in his Conversation, of a ready Wit, and of an
undaunted Spirit.

3. When therefore I perceived Choler much to abound, and he Costive in Body; I
gave order for him to be loosned with a Clyster, but being backward to take
that, I gave him some Pills made of washed Aloes, by which Choler is easily
carried off, as Galen witnesses, Lib. 14. de Meth.

4. I propounded this Syrup likewise. Take Syrup of Violets, of Vinegar simple,
of Water Lillies, of each one ounce: Waters of Succory, of Betony, of Endive,
of each two ounces: mix all these together, and make of them a Syrup for two
Doses. Then I purged him thus: Take of syrup of the Infusion of Damask Roses
with Rhubarb, one ounce and an half: pulp of Tamarinds extracted with water of
Violets, two drams: Electuary of the Juice of Roses, two drams: Whey, three
ounces: mix, and make a Potion.

5. And because it was Summertime, I cast Oxyrrhodinum into his Head:
afterward, toward the end, Oils of Violets, Camomil, and Dill mixed together:
I commanded his Feet to be drawn up, to be washed with the Decoction of
Willows, Mallows and Vine leaves; he snuffed Woman's Milk up his Nostrils.

6. I ordered him to eat such meats as were cooling, and would not easily be
resolved into vapors, namely, Lettice, Endive, Sorrel, Gourds, Fishes of
gravelly places, a rere Egg to be supped up with Verjuyce.

7. He forbore sweet things, and such as easily bred Choler, salt and sharp
things, which cause Choler to turn into Vapors; I granted him no Wine by any
means, except such as is made of Pomgranates: But in the end, I gave him leave
to drink white Wine, whereby the sharpness of the choleric humor, might be
allayed, which is commended by Galen, in Meth. Lib. 7. It brings away Choler by
Urine: I forbad the too great motion and disquiet both of his Mind and Body,
but when he grew well, I permitted him to walk up and down softly and gently,
both before and after Meat; by these means he said his Head was eased, and he
became at last perfectly well. Forest. Lib. 10. Obs. 47.

XXXII. A Vertigo from a cold, viscous and flatulent Humor.

1. One Roeland, a Priest of Delf, Chaplain of St. Vrsula, being scarce yet
grown old, and most of all in the Wintertime, a man of a gross and full Body
fat phlegmatic, living in idleness, after the manner of an Epicure, slothful,
sleepy, filled with Phlegm and crude humors; fed for a long time with phlegmatic
Food and thick Ale, from which plenty of Vapors easily ascend up to the Head,
became afflicted with a Vertigo, essentially bred in his Brain.

2. This the following signs did show, viz. his bringing away pituitous filth,
through his Mouth and Nostrils, his Head being heavy, Sleepiness, Face puffed
up, his color pale and depraved, his Head for the most part cold, his Senses
dull, and the Arteries about his Head not strongly beating.

3. Wherefore, when his Fit was over, I ordered a strong Clyster to be given
him, and appointed him to take the following Decoction. Take Marjoram, Hyssop,
Sage, Bay Leaves, Betony, of each one handful: lesser Centaury, Rue-Leaves, of
each half an handful: Rosemary-Flowers, Flowers of both Staechas's, Elder
Flowers, of each one pugil: Elecampane and Peony Roots, of each half an ounce:
Anniseed, Seeds of bastard Lovage, Caraways, of each two drams: Raisons of the
Sun, cleansed from the Stones, one ounce: Liquorice scraped, half an ounce:
boil all these together in fair Water; strain, and to a pint of the Colature,
add simple Oxymel, Syrup of Staechas, of each one ounce: mix, and make an
Apozem for four Doses: to be taken in the morning.

4. Then I purged him with these Pills following. Take Pil. Cochiae, Pil.
Agregative, of each one dram and an half: Castor, five grains: make seven
Pills, with Syrup of Staechas. Again, the Decoction being reiterated, and he
having taken Cochiae Pills with Castor, we came next to Errhines and
Gargarisms, then to other things: such all of them as might properly purge the
Head: applying withal, both inwardly and outwardly, things as might strengthen
the Brain and parts adjacent.

5. Now he seemed to be amended and restored, yet I ordered him to use means
twice a year, to prevent its returning again, least the Falling Sickness or an
Apoplexy should light on him, as it is wont to happen to old men, especially
such as are subject to the Vertigo.

6. But afterward neglecting our Advice, and growing into years, having a
mighty great Belly, so extremely sticking out, as can hardly be believed, so
that he could scarcely go: for observing no reason nor measure in his Diet,
indulging himself daily in Gluttony, Surfeiting and Drunkenness, he fell into a
deadly Apoplexy, as I foretold him; from which whereas he could not be freed,
neither by my Industry, nor by the care of Cornelius Eritius, my fellow
Brother, at last, ceasing to speak, snorting or snoring, he lived in that
misery for three days together, and then died. Forest. Lib. 10. Obs. 48.

XXXIII. A Vertigo from a disaffection of the Stomach, which afterward was
confirmed in the Brain.

1. William Berendrechtias, who was thirty three years of Age, the Kings
Secretary at Haganow, in the year 1558. having long been troubled with Weakness
and Loathing of his Stomach, fell into a Vertigo, which he was troubled with,
most of all when he walked in the Market, and saw others walking up and down,
so that he was forced to depart thence, or else he would have fallen to the
ground.

2. There came to him Henry Vergerius, a Physician, admirably exercised in the
Operations of Art: After he had given him Syrups good for the Head and Stomach,
he then gave him Pills of Hiera Picra cum Agarico, for that he had Phlegm mixed
with Choler; he anointed with Stomachical Ointment.

3. But whereas the Distemper began afterward to get strength in the Brain, it
was feared also the Falling Sickness would follow; wherefore they also
consulted with me, and would have me likewise consider his Nativity.

4. I erected a Celestial Figure, wherein Saturn was posited in the Western
Angle, Retrograde, and Mars in the fourth under the Earth, with the Virgins
Spike, which signifies such for the most part to dye with the Falling Sickness,
or Apoplexy, according to the determinations of the Stars: Jupiter and Luna
possessed the eighth House, they showed his Stomach and Head to be weak,
therefore there was need of very great foresight and care.

5. Now, although these things are not here to be preponderated as Physical
Indications, yet they made us to fear; but whereas he had gotten a pain in his
Head, after the Vertigo, his Brain being heated thereby, drawing to it Spirits
and Blood, by reason of the pain: this was not so ill a sign as we before
related, in the Prognostic Indications.

6. Wherefore, after he had been purged, this following Powder was Prescribed.
Take Peony root, and seed of the same, of each two drams: common Dittany seed,
and root of the same, of each one dram and an half: stinking Orach-seed, four
scruples: choice Cinnamon, Galangal, of each one dram and an half: Pearls
prepared, one scruple, round Birthwort, two drams: refined sugar, double weight
of all.

7. And afterward the following Confect was prescribed. Take Pyrethrum,
Costus, Staechas, of each half a dram: the best Agarick, two drams and a half,
Caraways, Fennel, Dill, Wood-Sage, round Bithwort, of each four scruples,
Clarified Honey, four ounces: with the forementioned Species make the Confect.
Afterward these were added: Take of the species Diacori Diamoschi Dulce, of
each two Drams: Syrup of Staechas, four ounces, mix them together.

8. By taking these things, he began to grow better, but afterward fell into a
bastard Tertian Ague, from which by me and Vergerius he was delivered: being
cured of his Fever, we consulted nevertheless, that he might be purged Spring
and Fall, which was of so great advantage to him, that he was so perfectly
cured of his Disease, that it never returned any more. Forest. Lib. 10. Observe.
49.

XXXIV. An observation of a Vertigo, with Weakness of sight.

1. To the Excellent Physician William Fabritius Hildanus, Melchior Sebizius
wishes Health.
2. Most worthy and Excellent Sir!
YOur Letter I have fully and copiously answered by two of mine, which though
written at diverse times, yet included almost one and the same Argument and
Matter, That if one should miscarry, the other, I hoped might arive at your
hands: But, that you have not hitherto returned an Answer, is to me somewhat
strange, and the more, because I have constantly and officiously importuned you
for some approved Remedy for my Mallady.

3. I fear, either they came not to your hands, or, that you are so employed in
other matters, that you cannot allow time to answer: Pardon me, That I am so
urgent, the present Occasion and bad Circumstances put me upon it to give you
another Trouble.

4. In all my distemper, there is nothing more afflicts me, Than whenever I
turn my head and neck either to the one side or the other, a dimness, or rather
a defect of sight seises upon me, so that I can scarce know any man, also a
dull kind of Pain throughout the whole Neck, which immediately ceases again:
sometimes it takes me in the hinder part of the head, about the beginning of
the spinal Marrow, but presently vanishes: When at any time with my head
bended, I write, or perform Exercises of the like nature, it returns and
seizes both the forepart and hinder part of my head, but my head being a little
elevated, a while after I have ease.

5. If I use and employ my hands for any considerable time, immediately I find
my Brain distempered; when I move, I appear as one intoxicated with strong
liquor: You have here, Sir! an account of my Disease, I hope, you will endeavor
to comply with my Request, and satisfy the desire of yours. Farewell.


Fabritius Hildanus his Answer.
6. To the most Noble and learned Gentleman Melchior Sebizius Senior, Fabritius
Hildanus wishes Health.
7. I Am not a little troubled for the Malady you complained of, how tedious
and grievious it is for old men to be troubled with dimness or defect of Sight:
I am partly sensible by my own Experience. My Advice (which, though in it self
not worth much, yet you seem to respect) I neither can, or ought to keep from
you, although indeed it be nothing else, but to bring Owls to Athens.

8. The Distemper I understand by your Letters is only a Dimness, or rather a
defect of Sight, chiefly when the Head is distorted either to the one side, or
the other, etc. The Cause of this and the other Diseases you Complain of, must
either proceed from some humor that falls down on the hinderpart of the Head
and the Optic Nerves, or, because of the Agitation of the spirits or vapors.

9. The temper of the brain, principally in old men, is cold and moist, the
native and radical heat being weak, those vapors which arise from the Lower
parts, presently are turned into excrementitious humors, and so seize upon the
Nerves, where they engender either a sharp or dull pain, as the matter is
peccant or mild.

10. If the Disease proceed from the animal Spirit, which is the Instrument of
Sight, and lies in the great Cavities and Arteries of the Brain, together with
the motion of the Humors, (For by the same motion (says Rasis) wherewith the
Head is moved, it is needful that the liquid things therein contained, do also
move;) the sight grows dull and is much obscured, and the man like one drunk,
reels from one place to another, and often falls heavily to the ground.

11. But if the Disease proceed from Repletion, viz. from the abundance of
Vapors that fly up to the head from the lower parts of the Body, and of
humors thence begotten: Who does not see that such are to be removed by
Evacuation?

12. 'Twill be worth your Notice to mind the Recipient part, viz. the Brain, as
well as the Repulsive: The Diet is principally to be regarded; Let it be such
as will afford good nutriment, and restore the Ventricle and the parts that
need Nutrition, together with the native Heat and radical Moisture.

13. Secondly, You must at some convenient Intervals, evacuate those Excrements
which are bred in the Bowels by reason of the want of native heat, that ought
to be done by the application of such Medicine, as not only simply expels and
evacuates Excrements, but by a certain specific Property draws them downward
from the head.

14. I have used with good success both as to my self and others, the following
Pills which strengthen the Ventricle, and other noble parts; the head and
Bowels they gently purge, they clear the Sight, and like a Balsam, they free
the body from corrupt and putrid humors. Take of most fine Aloes and three or
four times impregnated or dissolved in the Juice of Damask Roses inspissated,
one ounce: of choice Rubarb in most subtle powder, two drams; new Agarick
trochiscated and dried, one Dram: Confect of Alkermes, four scruples: Cream of
Tartar, one dram and an half: Chemical Oils of Cinnamon and Fennel, of each one
Scruple: mix them very well in a Mortar, and with a sufficient quantity of the
Extract of Betony and Scordium, make a Mass of Pills, of which exhibit a
scruple, or half a dram: they purge gently, and the next day commonly.

15. Let them be taken 2 or 3 hours after Supper, as other gentle Pills are
taken; at night, because of the abundance of Vapors which in sleep are carried
up to the head; the virtue of the Medicine more easily than in the daytime
reaching the Brain: there is advantage also to be had by the Pills of
Marocostinae, invented by Mindererus.

16. But if the Disease prove stubborn, more strong Medicines are to be
applied, first then the matter being prepared and concocted by some proper
Decoction of opening Roots, as the leaves and flowers of Betony, sweet
Marjoram, with the Syrup of Succory and Betony, of each a like quantity
prepared.

17. Afterward the Body is to be purged by Pilulae aureae, Cochiae
Aggregativae of Agarick, and the like, or the suffusion of Agarick, Rubarb and
Sena. The Ventricle and the parts that serve for Nutrition, are to be
strengthened, where the Confection of Alkermes de Hyacintho, also species
Aromatici Rosati Diarrhodon Abbatis, species de Gemmis Laetificans Galeni, and
others of this kind agree.

18. Although you use universal purgations, yet you must not neglect particular
ones: first, Masticatories, from Mastick, Pyrethrum, Marjoram, Betony,
Staves-acre, and the like, which gently draw noxious humors to the upper part
of the Throat.

19. From Errhines and sneesing I counsel you to forbear, for they shake beyond
all measure the Brain, and dull the sight, as I have shown by Example in other
places. When they draw matter out of the Ventricle of the Brain to the Nostrils,
in the passage they obstruct the optic Nerves.

20. The Use of Cupping-glasses, applied to the shoulder, and the nape of the
Neck, I do not approve of: often, in such cases, they bring the peccant matter
to the backbone, which is of great loss to the sick.

21. I have observed that a Noble Matron near Lusanu, was taken with the like
Distemper; and, after the applying of Cupping-glasses, was surprised with a
Palsy in her Arms.

22. The chief and only Remedy as well for curing the present Disease, as also
for preventing of many other distempers of the body, which Age makes us
obnoxious to, you may have, if in both Arms you suffer Issues to be made by the
potential Cautery; Amongst all the Remedys also, which expells noxious humors
out of the Body, they obtain the first and chief place.

23. Sometimes sagacious nature sends to those Fountains excrementitious
humors from the Breast and Head, as to a common shore, and by those sensibly
evacuates: I speak Experimentally, for I have 4 Issues, and those all tending
to my health.

24. But, what if you should find any Indisposition of the Liver, or Meseraick
Veins (for such commonly proceeds from sharp, choleric and dry Vapors from
the Liver) an issue made on the right knee will be very convenient, it will
expel the excrementitious humor of the Liver and the meseraick Veins, and will
strengthen the parts which serve Nutrition.

25. The head also is strengthened with a Fumigation of Mastick, Olibanum,
Styrax, BenZoin, and the like: as also by using a quilted cap of Spices
appropriated to the Disease: Written in haste at Bern. Bern, 9 October. 1621.

XXXV. A Vertigo with loss of Appetite and Pain of the Head.

1. The Advice of D. Anthony Frankanzan. This Young man, of seven years of Age,
having scratcht a small Pimple, it became a Scab or Exulceration, spreading
over his whole Leg.

2. The Pimple was black, the Exulceration lasted two years, but was removed by
the application of hot Ashes, and so was cured the ninth year.

3. Now for two years he was not troubled, but seeing he had a weak Stomach,
though not exulcerated, he suffered want of Appetite, and when Dinner was
delayed, he fell into a Vertigo and pain of the Head, he could not use his
Faculty of Imagination, nor continue a Discourse upon any thing, but presently
he forgot.

4. I shall give you my Opinion concerning his Temperature: He is of
Constitution cold, dry and melancholic, which I prove, from his slenderness,
costiveness and want of Hair; his Muscles are small, his principal Members as
his Heart is cold, his Pulse slow and rare, he is fearful, his Liver dry and
hot, and yet that heat does not exceed the coldness of his Heart.

5. That he has a dry Liver, it appears, because his Veins are small and
straight: That he has also a hot one, is clear, for he has been sick of
Feavors, which proceeds from Choler, and those Pimples show an Adust humor.

6. His Brain Temperate, for he is shamefac't, and his animal Operations good,
he abounds in heat: He is temparate as to siccity, he is moderate in his sleep,
and his Stomach always cold.

7. His custom was always to take Medicines, but he was inordinate, and kept no
good time as to his Studies; in Winter he often sat with cold Feet, to which
he added slothfulness, and never gave himself to Exercise.

8. The Causes and Symptoms are next to be enquired into, from whence the
Indications of Cure arise: Three things he suffers about the Stomach: first,
weakness; the Cause of this is Intemperateness; for, neither soon nor well does
he Digest; therefore is the Distemperature from cold.

9. Secondly, He suffers also want of Appetite, because coldness is the Cause
of want of Appetite, for the matter which before was evacuated by the Leg,
runs back to the Stomach, and chiefly a Salt Rheum, from whence there is a loss
of Appetite.

10. Thirdly, When he does not Dine soon, it presently comes to a swimming in
the Head: this is a Symptom of the Stomach, for it is done by consent, as
Vapors arising from the Stomach, for the Appetite craves adust humors from the
Liver, which coming to the mouth of the Stomach, ascend up to the Head: from
whence Avicen, To suffer Hunger, is to fill the Body with ill Humors.

11. He suffers pain in his Forehead, and this grief is from the Stomach: The
Animal Operations of the principal faculties of the Soul are diminished, he
cannot use his Imagination, nor speak well, the cause is some cold
intemperature of those parts.

12. It may be questioned, from whence comes this Intemperature? from the
paucity of the Spirits, and evil Concoction, in the Stomach; from thence the
Liver is adust, and so the Heart is cold, whence is a paucity both of Vital and
Animal Spirits.

13. Another reason for the intemperature of the Spirits, is, for that the
Liver generates blood that is cold, from whence also humors that are dull and
cold arise: it is doubtless originally from the Intemperature of the Stomach:
for the adust Humors are cold and sharp, and so are the Rhumatick.

14. Secondly, the cold Intemperature of the Brain, comes not only from the
paucity of the Spirits, but also from the intemperature of them.

15. The Curative Indications or Symptoms are taken from these, which are
Evacuation and Alteration, the matter is to be evacuated and the Stomach to be
altered, by somewhat that is contrary.

16. He must Evacuate all first, and afterward warm the Stomach: by the way of
alteration, increase the Spirits, and make them warmer: these are augmented,
when the Stomach is prepared to digest, and the warmness of the Liver is
remitted.

17. There is need to warm the Stomach, and to cool the Liver: but there is
nothing to be done to the Head; although the Liver is hot, yet I would not open
a Vein, lest there should follow a paucity of Spirits; I would have you to
loosen the Belly with Cassia or Hiera, for we have seen your Urine that it is
red and crude, thin and full of many Excrements.

18. They may be concocted with the Syrup of Fumitory, Honey of Roses,
Decoction of Chicory, and other things: They may be evacuated by Rhubarb and
Confectio Hamech; and the Evacuations should be repeated, according as there is
occasion.

19. Afterward to procure an Appetite, I would anoint it with the Oils of
Spiknard, Mastich, Mint, and with Spices: sometimes I would administer Sugar of
Roses, with the Species Aromaticum Rosatum.

20. But for change, it is better to apply somewhat outwardly: Let him not go
into hot Baths, unless in September; when he does use these, let the Liver be
anointed and strengthened with the Ointment of Sanders, premising Embrocations
of cold Distilled Waters, for the cooling of the Liver: Scholzij Consul. Med.

XXXVI. A Vertigo with Pain at the Stomach.

1. There are four things to be done, that we may prevent the Vertigo and other
Maladies, which proceed from the repletion of the Head: First, all Causes are
to be avoided, which fill the Head with Fumes, or stir up the Humors: Secondly,
if Humors abound in the Head, they are to be brought thence or diverted:
Thirdly, the Vapors are to be dispersed, and the Head strengthened: Fourthly,
that some Preservatives be administered for the Vertigo and Apoplexy.

2. First, there is nothing certainly fills the Head more than midday sleep,
and drinking after Supper: in sleep after meat, gross, thick and very dark
fumes fill the Head, in that abundance, as in a Furnace, in which wet Timber is
laid; and the Head being full of Vapors, the whole Body is weighed down, the
Man is made sadder, a Vertigo is near at hand, and also somewhat that is
Apoplectick.

3. And although to dryer Natures, midday sleep is not inconvenient or
dangerous, nevertheless it cannot be any ways profitable to those who have not
a little of repugnant and unwholesome humidity in the Stomach; and there is a
difference between fumes which come from dry Timber, and what come from wet.

4. Moreover, if cold drink be always taken after meat, and the Stomach belch,
many fumes are exhaled; chiefly great quaffing before sleep, and long feasting
and banqueting, are pestiferous and hurtful, both to Head and Stomach; nor can
the mouth of the Stomach be closed; for when it belcheth or is any way
disordered, and then endeavors to take some repose, what otherwise can follow,
but a repletion of the Head and a Catarrh? then the Vertigo also troubles.

5. Great cares and weighty affairs do extremely increase this Distemper, if
attended immediately after eating: so also meats that beget fumes, and too great
a quantity of liquor, or large drinking.

6. It is requisite such be avoided, by those who desire not to be troubled
with Catarrhs or a Vertigo, as also those things which cause a Plethory and a
Vertigo, viz. all vehement commotions of the Mind, great Anger, afflicting
Phansies, and Melancholy Imaginations, cold Air, Winds, as also gross and thick
Air with a cold, do afflict the Head and Nerves.

7. Those who are afraid of Diseases in the Nerves, they would do well to be
advised to keep carefully the Head, Neck, Feet and Stomach from Colds, and that
they would not suddenly strip themselves in the cold Air, after they come out
of a hot place, or when they begin to sweat, and that they would beware of the
Beams of the Moon and the Sun, because they fill the head with Vapors, and
breed both a Vertigo and Catarrh.

8. Secondly. But if the Vapors and the Repletion of the Head be increased,
you may use the Pills above-prescrib'd, the number of which you may increase or
diminish, as you see occasion.

9. By the powder of Nigella you may draw out some part through the Nostrills,
and the water of Marjoram may be taken to drive out the powder; which you may
take twice into the Nostrills, before meat; and thereby cleanse them: If your
powder be too strong, you may make use of the water only.

10. Take Roman Nigella infused in Vinegar a day and a night, furthermore being
dried, let him take a dram and an half of the powder, the Waters of Marjoram,
and of the Elder, of each one ounce, and mix them.

11. Thirdly, To dissipate Vapors, Let the head be washed in the morning with
herbs, afterward mentioned, put into the Lie of Ashes, the head being
afterward dried with warm cloths; Take the leaves of Stoechas, of Lavender,
Anthos, of each one pugil and a half, Indian spicknard, one dram; roots of
Asarabacca, three drams; the leaves of Sena, two drams; Agarick, one dram:
Betony, and vervain, of each an handful and an half: Marjoram, one pugil, let
them be bruised and put into a Lixivium, and boiled, as aforesaid.

12. And this odoriferous Pomander which follows, will be very useful, if the
Smell morning and evening be taken up the Nostrills; for that Odor dries and
dissipates the Vapors, and strengthens the head, Take pure Labdanum, two
scruples: Gallia Moschata, one Scruple: Lignum Aloes, Storax Calamita, of each
half a scruple: Mastich, Olibanum, Gum of Juniper, bitter Costus, of each five
grains: Ambergr se, Musk, of each one grain. Let them all be subtly powdered,
and with the Muscilage of Tragacanth extracted with Marjoram water, make
Pomanders.

13. The Confection following is very Excellent for strengthening both head and
stomach, which may be used with the rest, but every morning take the Quantity
of a Walnut, it is pleasant and effectual, and preserves the head and Stomach
from many Diseases: and it is this: Take Cheb Myrobalans condited, of each five
drams; green Ginger preserved, Calamus Aromaticus condited, Citron peels
confected, of each half an Ounce: Orange-Peels candied, three drams: Eringo
condited, five Drams, Indian Nutmegs preserved, two drams: Roots of Bugloss
condited, Cichory condited, of each half an ounce: Conserves of
Rosemary-flowers, Peony-flowers: Bawm of each two drams: Powder of Ey-bright,
one dram: Cinnamon in gross powder, one Scruple, as also Mace in gross powder,
half a dram: mix them all together, and make a Confect.

14. Lastly, This powder will be very useful if you be much troubled with the
Vertigo. Take Powder of Ey-bright with the flowers, half an Ounce, Mace steeped
in Vinegar, one dram: Coriander prepared, four Scruple: Betony one scruple:
Cubebs half a Scruple, Sugar Candy, six drams: and mix them. Of this let a dram
be taken in the morning, either by it self, or with the crumbs of Bread, or in a
rear Egg, or in boiled Ale: Also Fennel-seed covered over with sugar, and
chewed in the Morning, is good, for it dissipates the Vapors, and preserves
from the Vertigo, and clears the sight.

15. But if there be any Indications or Symptoms of an Apoplexy, this following
powder will be very good. Take of white Amber prepared two drams, of the Roots
of Peony, species Diarrhodon abbatis, of each half an ounce, and mix them. And
then take one dram every month the day after the new Moon, with a little
Cinnamon Water, or the Spirit of Wine: Whosoever shall continue the use of this
Remedy, at the time appointed, they may have their Bodies delivered from the
Apoplexy, and many other Symptoms. Consil. Medic. Scholzij, Obs. 113. ex Casp.

XXXVII. A Vertigo Scorbutical and fainting of the Spirits.

1. The Vertigo often comes upon an Inveterate Scurvy, to which is wont to be
added a fainting or assiduous sinking of the Spirits, and almost a continual
fear or dread of it: Also a Stupor or stiffness in the Members, with the sense
of a pricking here and there, running about them.

2. These kinds of Distempers proceed from the sinking of the Animal Spirits in
the Original Fountain: and sometimes of them which are contained in the Nerves:
both the Cardiack, and those serving for the Moving of the parts: and when they
fail in the Brain and nervous stock, being much surrounded with a Scorbutic
Salt, they are not easily cured.

3. Cephalic Remedies, such as are convenient in the Vertigo, and Paralytick
Disaffections, excited by themselves: are to be administered with
Antiscorbuticks mixed therewith: first, therefore, fit Catharticks being
exhibited, as such as are convenient in the Scurvy, you may proceed with
Specific Remedies against the said Vertigo, after this manner:

4. In the beginning of the Cure, open the hemorrhoidal Veins in the Fundament
by Leeches; and, unless any thing gainsay; Let it be several times repeated:
Then take of the Powder of male Peony-roots, four drams: Red Coral levigated,
two drams: Man's skull, Elks-claws prepared, of each one dram: mix them: Dose
from half a dram, to a dram.

5. Take of the best Sugar in Aqua Peoniae compound, or in water of wild
Radish, and boiled up to a Consistency eight ounces: of the best rectified Oil
of Amber, half an ounce: make thereof Tablets, and take of them from one dram
and half to two drams, morning and evening, drinking after it a draught of the
following distilled water.

6. Take Scurvy Grass, brook-lime, Garden-cresses, Lillies of the Valley, Sage,
Rosemary, Betony of each three handfuls: green Wall-nuts four pounds: Rinds of
Oranges, number six: Limon peels, number 4. fresh roots of Male-Peony, half a
pound: being bruised and cut, put to them the phlegm of Vitriol, one pound: Whey
made with Cider five pounds: distill them after the common way to dryness,
letting the whole water be mixed together. The Dose from three ounces to four,
five or six. Willis de Scorbut. cap. 9.

XXXVIII. A Vertigo Scorbutical in the highest degree.

1. A man about 40 years of Age, of a Melancholy habit, afflicted for many
years with the Scurvy, was often sensible of diverse and manifold Symptoms
thereof, at various seasons of the year.

2. There was seen about his thighs, large black spots and marks, as if
proceeding of strokes, pains of the Belly, with a looseness, often afflicting
him, his urine most commonly like Lie, having almost constantly a spontaneous
weariness, a failure of his strength, and a want of Appetite. Besides the
ordinary Evils, and as it were customary, he lived obnoxious to most cruel fits
of sickness, and those of various kinds.

3. Two years before, when I first saw him, he complained strangely of a mighty
Difficulty of Breathing, as if he was in danger of Suffocation, with a
trembling of the heart, a fainting of the Spirits, and a constant fear of
Swooning; also if any of the Symptoms of the Precordia ceased a while, for the
most part a Vertigo, or heavy giddiness and swiming of the head assaulted him.

4. After he had for some time taken Antispasmadick and Antiscorbutick remedies
mixed together, he seemed to be perfectly well: but then within a few Weeks he
was affected with a nauseousness and Pain about the Heart with an Inflation of
the Hypocondria; his Urine was but little and very Lixivial, and shortly after
the Abdomen swelled up, and then his Feet and Legs with a great Waterish
swelling, showed the Signs of a growing Dropsy.

5. Afterward the same Tumor invaded the Flesh of his Thighs, Arms and Back
also: which Distemper however though it seemed desperate was easily Cured, with
Antiscorbutick Remedies, with the Addition of Catharticks and Diuretics.

6. But yet this Remarkable person although he was restored to Health, did not
continue so long; for two quarters were scarcely past, but he began to complain
of a grievous Headache, with a Vertigo and pertinacious waking, and then
without any evident Cause, he was taken with most horrid Vomiting: a little
while after his Asthmatical Fits, with the Trembling of his Heart, and sinking
down of his Spirits, Returned.

7. At this time again when he almost seemed desperate, he grew well in a
little while, with the use of Antiscorbutick Medicaments.

8. It plainly appears by this Case, how many Evils the Scorbutic Infection,
like to ferment lying hid both in the Blood and Nervous Juice, and as occasion
serves (spreading abroad its Poison) can cause, which kind of Distempers, how
horrid and terrible soever they seem, whilst they depend only of the Humors
vitiated in their Complexion, and that the Viscera are not at all hurt in their
Tone or Conformation, are wont to be Cured most commonly very easily or without
much trouble, viz. with an Antiscorbutick Method aptly designed, both according
to the condition of the Patient and of the Disease. Willis de scorbuto, cap. 11.

XXXIX. Of a Dark Vertigo.

1. A certain Noble Man addicted to the Diversion of Hunting, having by swift
and too much Running, great Showting and Hallowings broken the little Veins in
his Brain, there happened such an Abundant and Immoderate Flux of Blood, that
he was deprived of heat, and was so afflicted with a dark and clowdy Vertigo,
as that he was scarce able to go or stand.

2. The following Medicines were very profitable to him. Take Chemical Oils of
Marjoram, Sage, Anise, Fennel, of each six drops: Oil of sweet Almonds one
dram: of Amber, eighteen drops: of Pismires twelve drops: Anoint the Nape of
the Neck and Temples, and drop one or two drops into the Ears, afterward stop
them up with Cotton:

3. Use also the following Powder. Take the species Diamoschi dulcis, Diambrae,
Dianisi, Aromatici Rosati, of each one dram and half: Cubebs two scruples:
Anniseeds one dram: Fennel, Coriander prepared of each a dram and an half:
Mace, Cinnamon, the roots of Florentine Orrice of each two scruples; Peony a
dram and a half: white Sugar six drams: make a most subtle Powder. Let him take
Morning and Evening one dram, at once: either by it self, or in hot Wine. Ex
Grulingio Cent. Observe. 3.

XL. A Vertigo with a Catarrh.

1. A certain Pastor being afflicted almost every year, twice or thrice with a
Catarrh, falling down from the Head to the Breast which was attended by a
troublesome Vertigo, at length seeing himself in danger of of Suffocation
thereby; Invited me to his Cure.

2. I prescribed him the use of the following Medicines. Take Pilulae Cochiae,
one scruple: Extract of Mechoacan, five grains: Oils of Fennel two drops: make
Pills to the number of twelve, and let them be Gilded. Take the the Conserves
of the Flowers of Rosemary, Balm, Lavender, Sage, one dram and half: Orange
peels candied, six drams: Indian Nutmegs candied, one dram and half: Indian
Ginger candied, one dram: the species Diambrae, Aromatici Rosati, Diamoschi
dulcis, of each one dram and half: white Sugar dissolved in Fennel water, four
ounces: to which add the Extract of Calamus Aromaticus, one scruple: the Oil of
Fennel, six drops; make Morsels according to Art.

3. To stop the Vapors ascending to the Head; Take the flesh of Quinces dried,
one dram and half: seeds of Annise and Fennel, Coriander prepared, of each two
drams and half: red Coral prepared, one dram and half: Spodium, one scruple:
Mastich species Diarrhodon abbatis, of each one dram: Sugar Biscuit one ounce
and half: make a Powder, and let him take one spoonful at once after Meat:

4. Moreover I enjoined him the taking of three grains or five of Olibanum or
Mastich, and that he abstain from Meats that are Vaporous, such as Onions,
Garlic, Mustard, and the like. Ex Grulingio, Cent. Cur. 23.

XLI. A Vertigo originally in the Head, which became an Epilepsy.

1. A certain young Maid; of sound Parents, and her Self originally Healthful;
being necessitated to Watch whole Nights with a Master that had been long Sick,
and having but Interrupted Naps, began to complain of a Vertigo and heaviness
in her Head.

2. Within a little time after, the Distemper growing worse, she felt
Tremblings in her whole Body, which came at certain Times, though wandering and
uncertain; afterward she suffered Convulsive Fits, and those very great and
often Infesting.

3. Not long before the approach of the Disease, she was troubled with a short
Scotomie, or Swimming in her Head, and felt a streightness and great oppression
of her Breast, whereby all her Praecordia were drawn together: th^n presently
gnashing her Teeth, and giving a great Groan, she was wont to fall to the
ground.

4. In the Interim she was sensible, but yet labored under the great
oppression of the Heart, till that Constriction of her Breast was loosned, she
was not able by any means to Rise.

5. When the Fit was past, she was afflicted with a great Palpitation of the
Heart, an heaviness of the Senses, and a great debility of the Animal Function.

6. After that this Maid had lived in this Condition for about fourteen Months,
she at last became Epileptical, that as often as she was assaulted by the Fit,
she was not only flung prostrate on the Earth, but was rendered Insensible and
Amazed, foaming at the Mouth, and having other peculiar Symptoms of the
Falling Sickness.

7. Neither did this Distemper terminate here, but before a year was elapsed,
it degenerated into Madness, and sometimes stupid Foolishness.

8. It is plain from the beginning, Progress and Metamorphosis of the Disease,
that it had at first its Rise and Seat in the Head, near the beginning of the
Nerves, and did enlarge it bounds both into the Brain and the Nervous System.

9. For from the beginning the Morbifick matter consisting near the beginnings
of the Nerves, caused lighter Spasms or Convulsions of the Viscera and Members,
with the Vertigo; afterward a Portion of it having fallen into the Pneumonick
Nerves, produced terrible Convulsions of the Praecordia, Diaphragma, and
Ventricle.

10. And also another Portion of the same matter seizing the Brain and its
Marrow, caused the Insensibility, and consequently the fits of the
Falling Sickness, and at length the Texture of the Spirits being wholly
vitiated, in their Latex being degenerated into a most sharp Liquor, the
Convulsive Distempers passed into Madness.

11. Now as to the particular Reasons both of the Disease and its Symptoms, the
aforesaid Virgin, by her sedentary Life, want of Exercise, and a more free Air,
together with her nocturnal watchings and the Interruption of her Sleep, had
contracted a Vicious Disposition of the Blood and Humors, and a weak and
depraved Constitution of the Brain and nervous stock.

12. And first of all, the heterogenous Particles being poured forth together
with the nervous Juice into the Brain and Cerebel, and there cleaving to the
Spirits, as it were skirmished with the Preliminary Scotomy and Vertiginous
Distemper: then the Convulsive matter settling upon the beginning of the
wandering pair and intercostal Nerves, and the spinal Marrow brought in with the
Vertigo, the leaping of the Viscera and Muscles, and their Light or shakings.

13. Afterward, when entering more deeply the Pipes of the nerves, it was
carried into the Cervical and Cardiack, and perhaps Intercostal, and other
unfoldings, and embued the spirits, performing the office of Respiration and
the Pulse, with an Explosive Copula.

14. They being brought into Explosions at every turn, together with their
Superiors, inhabiting the nervous Origin by reason of Fullness, or because of
Irritation, excited most horrid convulsions of the respective parts.

15. But the Fit growing strong from the Pneumonick or breathing Veins being
strictly bound, the sudden Inordinate Systole of the Thorax, was stirred up;
then presently the Diaphragma being suddenly and vehemently drawn back, the
obstreperous Ejaculation did succeed.

16 Further, When, by Reason of the Systole of the Thorax, being sometime
continued, the blood being hindered, that it could not move, it stagnated
altogether in the Praecordia, therefore, during the Fit, That great oppression
of the heart, with want of Speech and Motion afflicted the sick Maid.

17. But in the mean time, while as yet the Region of the Brain remained free
and clear from the Explosions of the Spirits, the sick party remained in her
Senses and Memory: but the Convulsive matter being daily increased, it was
unfolded in the middle and marrowy parts of the debilitated Brain; to the
former passions about the Precordia came also the Insensibility and Amazedness,
then the Epilepsy; and lastly Madness, for the Reasons before Recited: Many
Medicines were prescribed to this Maid by several Physicians and Empericks; but
did her no good. Willis de Convulsivis, cap. 5. Observe. 4.

XLIII. A Virtigo Idiopathetick with Various Symptoms.

1. A certain fair and well-colored woman from a settled Grief fell into a
sickly Disposition; in the Evening she was pretty well; but in the Morning, for
she grew very somnolent and heavy, she complained of a Stupidness and Heaviness
in her whole head, with a Vertigo at every motion thereof.

2. A little after she constantly expected a Convulsive fit, or the insensible
amazedness of the Spirits, and sometimes this, and sometimes the other did
infest her. For that after the Vertigo, as it were a praevious Velitation, for
the most part, she felt in her Ventricle, and left side an heavy or weighty
pain running up and down here and there: hence Belching, a striving to Vomit,
eruptions of Blasts: also wonderful distentions of the Abdomen and Hypocondria,
did follow and sometimes for many hours, did miserably exercise this Woman.

3. But sometimes these Symptoms happened to be wanting, and then the Distemper
more cruelly afflicted her Brain. For, falling into frequent insensible Fits,
she was wont to continue a great while immovable, and with her Eyes shut, void
of sense or understanding.

4. And when she moved by Rubbing and the fume of Tobacco, she came to herself,
but presently fell again into the like Insensibleness, and that three or four
times before she could recover herself: at length the Tragedy being acted, she
remained affected in some measure with a heaviness and torpor of the head,
about noon she had some alleviation of the Distemper, which continued till next
morning, and then the same symptoms would return again.

5. They that shall seriously consider those Symptoms need not suppose them to
rise from the Womb or Spleen, and in those look for the morbifick cause in
vain, but to arise rather from the Head.

6. For it seems that by reason of great Melancholy and sadness which hapens
often to Women at the beginning, a great Debility with a vicious taint was
impressed on her brain, so indeed that the animal spirits derived to the Brain
and Cerebellum, brought with them heterogeneous particles of a mixed kind, viz.
partly Narcotick or stupifying, and partly explosive or rushing forth.

7. Which kind of Copula, when they had more plentifully conceived, through
sleep, they were stirred up to the shaking of it off, by mere fullness: as soon
therefore as the Woman was awakened, the same spirits being moved, either a
bending downward being made below, they were depressed upon the beginnings of
the Nerves, and there being exploded they excited Convulsions of the Viscera;
or leaping back toward the middle of the Brain, and being there struck off,
they brought in those frequent and terrible Insensibilities.

8. In truth, this Distemper was somewhat a kin to the Epilepsie, but that the
Morbific matter was not as yet stayed within the regal place of the Brain, or
its middle part, so that there it might infect the Spirits, within their
Fountains.

9. But yet, the same heterogeneous Copula, did cleave more strictly to them,
dissociated or disjoined below, and dividing themselves into various and lesser
Rivolets, according to the beginnings of the Nerves: in the mean time, the
spirits whereby they might shake off that matter, being often explosed, caused
the Stupor and Insensibility, but bending to some other place, they rushed upon
the beginnings of the Nerves, for that reason caused those Spasms or
Convulsions of the Viscera.

10. But that the Fits come only in the morning after a plentiful Sleep, the
Reason was because the heterogeneous Copula of the Spirits, coming to them with
the nervous juice, was at that time, gathered together to a fit fullness for
Explosions, which being then wholly shaken off, the sick Person remained all the
rest of the day free from the Distemper, till the next day.

11. When the nights sleep had brought to the head a new supplement of
morbifick matter, the like Fit returned in the morning, which perhaps as the
sleep had been shorter or longer, was moved now within the Brain and near the
nervous origin. Willis de Convulsivis, Chap. 5. Obs. 5.

XLIV. A Vertigo in an Ancient Woman.

1. A virtuous woman aged 67, yet of a fresh and florid Countenance, fat in
Body, when she had been for some while obnoxious at first to a swelling of the
Face, and very grievious Fits of the Headache; the Winter being cold, she fell
into a very troublesome Vertigo, which was accompanied with a trembling of the
heart, a fainting away of the Spirits, and a frequent Inclination and striving
to Vomit; being laid on her Bed, she was afflicted with a grievous Giddiness,
or swimming of the head, with swooning and Symptomatick Vomiting, if at any
time she opened her Eyes, or turned her from one side to another.

2. Having visited this woman, I conjectured That the Cause of her sickness was
the Convulsive matter translated from the exterior Region of the Head to the
most inward Recesses of the Encephalon, by whose Inspiration or heterogeneous
Copula, the animal spirits being touched while they leaped forth inordinately
toward the Brain, they excited the vertiginous distemper.

3. And while they rushed suddenly upon the heads of the Nerves, the Scotomy
disorder of the Praecordia and endeavoring to vomit, a large Vesicatory or
blistering Plaster being applied to the nape of the Neck and behind her Ears,
Clysters daily administered, as also the use of the spirits of hartshorn
frequently and of a Cephalic Julap, she recovered within a few days. Willis de
Convulsivis, Cap. 5. Obs. 3.

XLV. A Vertigo with a Convulsion.

1. A noted person 34 years old, being for a long time subject to a Cough, with
great and thick spitting, having the pores of his skin very open, he was wont
to sweat continually, and every night to be wet with it:

2. About the beginning of the spring, he perceived those usual Evacuations to
happen more sparingly: In the interim he complained of the fullness of his hands
and feet, and as it were a certain swelling or puffing up, so that he feared a
Dropsy coming upon him; besides he was afflicted in his head with a Giddiness
and frequent Vertigo.

3. This Evil increasing, light Contractions and sudden Convulsions were
ordinarily excited, about his lips and other parts of the mouth and face: also
presently after, the morbifick matter flowing upon the beginnings of the
wandering pair and intercostal Nerves, he was troubled with a trembling and
leaping of the heart, and with a frequent faintness of the vital spirits, as if
a Leipothemy or swooning was fallen upon him.

4. I know that there are not a few, who ascribe these Convulsive Passions
which grievously infest and afflict the Precordia, to the Vapors arising from
the spleen; but it seems much more correspondent to Reason to deduce them from
the Convulsive matter laid up in the Brain, and rushing upon the beginnings of
the Nerves; because a translation of some Excrements from some other parts to
the head goes before.

5. And that it is so laid up within the Compass of the Encephalon, the almost
vertiginous Disease and the Convulsions of the parts of the Mouth and Face,
testifies it plainly.

6. Wherefore I thought good to prescribe to this man Remedies according to the
Method hereafter shown. I could here propose many Observations of this Nature,
in whom the Morbifick matter subsisting near the beginnings of the Nerves, stir
up light Spasms or Convulsions only of the Viscera or members with a Vertigo:
because a portion of this matter descending from the Head enters more deeply
the Pipes of the Nerves, and so strows the tinder or enkindling of the
Explosive seed, as it were Gunpowder, about their middle and ultimate
Processes, and enfoldings. Willis de Convul. Chap. 5. Obs. 3.

XLVI. A Vertigo with Coruscation of the spirits.

1. A certain Parson, sixty years of age was afflicted about three months with
a light Vertigo and a frequent coruscation of the Spirits in the forepart of
the Head.

2. At length the Disease increasing and waxing heavier, he became (...), and
as it were sometimes dead; in so much that when he was walking, he often fell
down flat on the ground.

3. As to the Cure, I followed this Method; First, I prescribed Phlebotomy with
light Catharticks, at certain intervals to be repeated; as also Electuaries and
Mixtures, such as I have before mentioned: Vesicatories and other
Administrations were not neglected.

4. About a fortnight after, perceiving no relief to the person by these
Medicines: I exhibited a Vomit of the Salt of Vitriol, and the Infusion of
Crocus Metallorum; by taking of which having ten easy Vomits, he grew
immediately well.

5. And having applied to him alterative Cephalicks for about a fortnight, he
perfectly recovered, and from that time, for the space of six years after, he
took every Spring and Fall a Vomit, with some other Medicines: Willis
Exercitationes Patholog. Cap. 7. Obs. 1.

XLVII. A Vertigo in an ancient man.

1. A certain Gentleman about 66. years of age, being for a long time obnoxious
to a light Vertigo, which was wont to be sometimes but occasionally excited,
became at length grieviously afflicted with this Distemper, in so much that he
grew very oblivious and forgetful.

2. After he had been sick about three Weeks, I went to Visit him, finding him
vastly altered, and the Vigor of his Ey-sight and Countenance sensibly
decayed: about the Evening, he was Feverish, and his Pulse did beat high and
swift.

3. Therefore I commanded a little Blood to be taken out of his Arm, and 6 or 7
days after I ordered some blood to be drawn out of the Hemorrhoidal Veins;
then Vesicatories to be applied to his Neck, and afterward behind his Ears: I
was careful also that Cauteries should be applied for making two large Issues
between the Shoulder-blades, and that he daily took inwardly Cephalic
Medicines of every kind at Physical hours.

4. In the space of a Month he began to recover, and to walk abroad, and to
attend his domestic and other affairs.

5. But having contracted a Cold by going abroad in the beginning of Winter, he
fell into a Fever, attended with a greater Perturbation of the Spirits; and
toward the evening he doted every day, in so much that he knew not what he
spoke and acted.

6. Howbeit within 7 or 8 days after by letting Blood, and a thin Diet, his
Fever vanished, and the affection and disposition of the Brain was altered
from its former state: For the Vertigo being ceased, he became forgetful and
Paralytick in the whole right Side.

7. Being often asked concerning the Condition of his Head; as, whether it was
clear and lightsom, or whether it was free from a Scotomie and confused
Phantasms? He answered, It was never better with him as to these things, for he
knew his own Infirmity, his Neighbors, Friends, and such as came to visit him;
but could not Remember scarcely the names of any of them.

8. When, at any time he entered into the Discourse of Affairs, he wanted words
to express the sense of his thoughts: at length there was not only a total
Resolution in the right Arm and Leg, but also a mighty tumor Oedematosus in
them both: insomuch that his Cure and the prolongation of his days was so much
doubted as that there was scarcely the least hope left.

9. However I did not desist from the Method of Cure, and the Assistance of the
learned and skilful Physician Dr. Wharton: but with joint Counsels, for the
Benefit of the sick, we prescribed solutive Pills to be taken at certain times,
and at other days we ordered Cephalic, Antiscorbutick and Antiparalytick
Medicines, to be taken at physical hours; and a Plaster of Gum and Balsoms to
be applied to the head, being first shaved, as also the Parts affected to be
anointed with Oils and Balsams, and strongly rubbed.

10. While these things were used with some good Success as to the perspicuity
and clearness of his Intellect, he fell (but by what means I know not) into a
Fever about the middle of Winter, every night he was afflicted with great heat
and thirst, and broken and interrupted Sleeps, his Tongue was parched and
rough, his Pulse high, and his Urine red.

11. We did forbear Phlebotomy, because of his Age, Palsy, and chiefly the
Dropsy, which was begun in the right side; but yet a thin diet of Barley and
Oatmeal Broths being Prescibed him, we did exhibit from day to day Julleps,
Apozems, and other Medicines provoking Sweat and Urine, the Issue at the
Shoulder Blade, running at this time very plentifully.

12. The sick was much better, both in respect to his Memory and the Palsy; and
every day recovering from both these affects, together with the Fever, he
arrived at perfect health, and continues so.

13. In this sick person, the motion and various alterations of the morbifick
matter, was very notable, for that adhering to the Meditullium of the Brain, to
wit, the Callous Body, did excite an outrageous Vertigo: the same was
afterward augmented, and (as it is probable) diffused farther into the
Meanders and turnings of the Brain, and so procured oblivion in the first
affect.

14. Afterward the same matter moved by the Fever, and a little discussed or
driven back, partly falling into the one streaked body, did bring a Palsy of
one half of the Body, partly coming into the compass of the Brain, did almost
deprive him of his Memory, the calous body in the mean while, obtaining as it
were, a clearness or serenity.

15. Lastly, It was not without the help of the other Fever, that the
morbifick matter being driven out of all its Forts, should be wholly defeated.

XLVIII. A Vertigo Ideopathetick.

1. Being wearied with the importunate complaints of one afflicted with a
Vertigo, after many things had been used in vain: I prescribed to be taken,
twice every day, for the space of a Month about a spoonful of the following
powder, drinking thereupon a draught of the Decoction of Sage or Rosemary,
impregnated with the Tincture of Coffee.

2. Take the Roots of Male Peony, two ounces, and the flowers of the same
bruised and dried one ounce: the white dung of Peacooks, half a pound: white
Sugar, two ounces: make a powder.

3. It is scarcely credible how much good this person found in that Remedy;
after a Month he came to visit me, but he seemed as it were, another or a new
man, being free of his Vertigo, he went briskly about his Affairs. Willis,
Exercitat. Pathol. Cap. 7. Obs. 3.

XLIX. A Vertigo Convulsive.

1. Some years since a stranger, who lodged in this City sent for me; I
suspected at the first sight that he was possessed, and believed that he had
more need of a Conjurer than a Physician; he was forty years old, who at set
times of the year, for the space of three years had been wont to be afflicted
with Convulsive motions:

2. Whilst he by chance lodged here for a few days, about his occasions,
growing melancholy, he had a fit of his Sickness, greater than usual.

3. He was wont for two or three days before hand, to sensibly feell the
coming of his Disease, viz. from a great commotion within the forepart of the
Head, and almost a continual Vertigo, and frequent dimness of his Eyes.

4. But the fit coming upon him, his Eyes at the first were variously roled
about and inverted, then a certain bulky substance, like a living Creature, was
seen to creep from the bottom of his Belly upwards, toward his Heart and
Breast, and from thence to his Head.

5. I pressing his Belly with my Hand, felt very discerningly this kind of
motion, and as long as I hindered this round thing from ascending, with both my
Hands, and all my strength, he found himself indifferently well.

6. But as soon as this swelling, creeping upwards by degrees, had reached the
Head, presently the Members of the whole body were cruelly pulled together,
insomuch that he would dash himself against the Walls or Posts, as if possessed
by an Evil Spirit, he could hardly be held and restrained by four strong men,
with all their force, but that he would leap from them, and fling out his Arms,
Feet and Head, here and there, with diverse kinds of motions.

7. When he forbore struggling or leaping out, his Members would be strongly
extended, and his Muscles stiff, as if troubled with the Cramp.

8. Such a fit would last about a quarter of an hour, then coming to himself,
he would talk soberly, and walk about in his Chamber, he knew what he had
suffered, and asked pardon of the standers by.

9. Immediately after, he began to draw his Eyes inward, and so swiftly to roll
them about, then presently the Convulsive Distemper returning, acted over again
the same Tragedy: and after this manner he would have five or six of these kind
of Convulsive Fits, within the space of three hours.

10. In the midst of one of these Fits, a Vein in his Arm being opened, and a
large Orifice made, the blood issued out leisurely, and was seen presently to
be Congealed; it did not flow about in the Dish after the manner of Liquors,
with a plain and equal superficies, but like melted Suet dropped into a cold
Dish, one drop being heaped upon another, it grew to a heap.

11. If this Distemper had happened to a Woman, it would have been presently
concluded, That it was the Mother or Hysterical, and the cause of it would have
beee ascribed to the fault of the Womb, especially because the ascending of
something like a bulk, began the fit from the bottom of the Belly.

12. But when this common ordinary solution, which is oftenest the subterfuge
of Ignorance, cannot be allowed in this case, it seems most agreeable to
reason, to refer all those Symptoms to the Evil affection of the Brain and
Nervous stock.

13. For truly it may be plainly collected, That the Cause of the Distemper lay
hid in the Head it self, by the Symptoms preceding the Fit, which did
Demonstrate a very great agitation of the Spirits within the Head.

14. The Inflation of the Brain, and heavy swimmings which came just as the Fit
was coming on him; and the turnings of the Eyes did manifestly denote that
heterogeneous and explosive particles did adhere to the Spirits, dwelling
within the Encephalon, near to the beginning of the Nerves.

15. So that this Case comes near to the nature of the Epilepsy, excepting that
the Spirits within the middle of the Brain did not admit an Heterogeneous
Copula, nor being explosed in another place, did they outragiously break forth
there; for during the fit, the sick person was still in his Senses, or had the
use of his Memory.

16. But the Morbifick matter, being more abundantly laid up in the Head, from
whence it descended into the Pipes, both of the exterior and interior Nerves,
it had placed mines of explosive Seeds, very diffusive into the Viscera, both
of the lower and middle Belly, and also in the exterior Members.

17. So that when the Animal Spirits began to be explosed, near the beginnings
of the Nerves, presently from thence, others inhabiting the Mesenterick
enfoldings, and then others, in the other nervous enfoldings, interjected from
the utmost bound, even to the Head, being explosed in order, did even continue
the Convulsions, from one part to another, until they came to the Head it self.

18. But presently being translated from thence to the spirits, dwelling in the
Spinal Marrow and appending Nerves, the most strong Convulsions of the Muscies
and Members of the whole body followed, that ascent of the bulk or substance,
which very often was perceived in the lower Belly, about the beginning of the
Convulsions, proceeding from the Spirits, within the Mesenterick enfoldings,
being brought into explosions, shall be more largely declared, when we come to
Discourse of Hysteric Passions.

19. If it be asked for what reason that the Convulsive Paroxism, beginning in
the part of the Head, near the beginnings of the Nerves, presently the Spirits,
dwelling in the outmost parts (as many as are pre-disposed for that symptom)
enter into Explosions, and so transfer the Convulsive Disease, being there
fully raised upwards; for it is so for the most part, whether the entrance of
the Disease begins in the bottom of the Belly, or about the middle of the
Abdomen, the Hypocondria or Praecordia, for that the Convulsion is wont to
creep by degrees, from those places toward the Head.

20. I say, for the Solution of this, these two Considerations are offered,
viz. in the first place we consider, that when some whole series of Spirits are
disturbed, those who reside in the extremest bounds, are first destituted of
their original Influence, wherefore they before others, grow outrageous and
irregular; hence it is, when the Nerve of the Arm or Thigh is strained hard by
leaning on it, that the wonted influence is hindered, that a numbness, with a
sense of pricking or tingling is first felt in the Fingers or Toes, from whence
by degrees it creeps upwards to the part affected.

21. Secondly, The other is, which is the cause rather of this Distemper, viz.
That the Spirits being ready for explosions, when they are contained within the
Nervous Pipes, one or more, as so many little distinct Tubes, they require a
sufficient ample space, in which they may be able very much, and indeed
successively to be rarefied and expanded, which thing, because it cannot be
easily performed, within the Trunks of the Nerves, from the beginning toward
the end; therefore, while the Spirits, about the Nervous Origin, being first
struck off, leap back toward the Encephalon, for that cause they stir up the
Vertigo.

22. The more open explosions of the Spirits, for the most part begins about
the inferior passages of the Nerves, or at their Extremities, where the Trunk
of the Nerve, is either dilated into more open foldings, or terminated in more
Fibers largely dispersed abroad.

23. Then those Spirits being explosed, there is room made presently for others
succeeding in order, whereby in like manner they may be explosed.

24. Hence we may observe, whilst the exterior Spirits are explosed, if a
ligature or hard compression being made, the succession of others into the same
space, or their progress toward the exterior parts be intercepted, the
Convulsion is wont to be hindered, that it cannot ascend upwards.

25. Wherefore, when a Numbness being arisen from the farthest end of the
Finger, or Toe, creeps to the superior parts with a tingling or with a cold
Air, and at length, reaching the Brain, causes most horrid Convulsions; if
after the motion is begun, the Arm or Thigh be strongly tied, the Spasm or
Convulsions not being able to get over the bound place, is hindered from coming
to the Head.

26. Yea, it is usual for Hysterical Women, as soon as the swelling in the
Belly, or the ascent of the bulk in the Abdomen is first perceived, to gird
strongly their Wastes, with swathing bands, and so oftentimes they prevent the
Precordia, and Region of the Brain, from being disturbed, by that same
Convulsive Fit.

27. But that the Blood, let out in the midst of the Fit was soon congealed, it
falls out ordinarily so, in Convulsive and Apoplectical Diseases, as the most
famous Heighmore has observed out of Hendochius.

28. But that some from hence argue; That Convulsions depend on the thickness
of the Blood and stagnation, its motion being impeded cannot be allowed;
because the blood drawn from those that are obnoxious to Convulsions, a little
before the Fit, is dilated with Serum, and fluid enough.

29. Wherefore we may judiciously think, That the Congelation is caused by the
Paroxism it self, because in Convulsive motions, and immoderate contractions of
the Nerves and Viscera, the inter-flowing blood, by the exhalations of its
Spirits and Serum, is somewhat losened in its mixtion, and therefore in some
sort coagulated, not unlike Milk, which by reason of too much agitation and
separation of the parts, one from another, grows into Butter: wherefore this
kind of Coagulation of the blood, seems rather to be the Effect, than the Cause
of the Convulsions.

30. In order to the Cure of this Distemper, That Learned Man makes the first
Indication to be, to draw away the matter enkindling the Disease, viz. that the
blood might no affix its Heterogeneous particles, either begot in it self, or
received from other parts, as the Viscera on the Head or Brain: for this
purpose, Evacuations are first to be performed.

31. Vomits for the most part bring help here, such are the Infusion of Crocus
Metallorum, Salt of Vitriol, Vinum sciliticum, which may be given at first,
then almost the next day, a quantity of Blood may be taken away.

32. After which, you may give this following gentle Cephalic Purge. Take Pil.
de succino Cratonis or Pil. Tartari Bontij, two Drams: Resin of Jallap, sixteen
Grains: Castoreum, a Scruple: Oil of Rosemary or Amber, half a Scruple, the Gum
Ammoniacum, distilled in Hysteric Water, enough to make it up into sixteen
Pills. Dose four, every sixth or seventh day.

33. They that cannot swallow Pills, may take this following Apozem. Take Roots
of Polypody of the Oak, sharp pointed Dock prepared, of each six drams: Roots
of the Male Peony, six drams: leaves of Betony, Germander, Vervain, Veronica,
Gout-Ivy, of each a handful: Burdock seeds, Cardamums, of each three drams:
Spring Water, four Pints: boil it to two Pints, strain, and add to the
straining, choice Sena, one ounce: Rhubarb, six drams: Gummy Turbith, half an
ounce: Epithymum, Yellow Sanders, yellow Rinds of Oranges, of each two drams:
Salts of Wormwood and of Scurvy Grass, of each one dram: digest them close in a
hot sand, for twelve hours: strain and sweeten it with a sufficient quantity of
syrup of Succory with Rhubarb. The Dose six Ounces, once or twice a Week.

34. The second Indication of Cure, is to Corroborate the Brain and Animal
spirits, by strengthening and Specific Remedies, which may destroy the
Heterogeneous Copula; which are to be chosen according to the Constitution,
Habit and Temperament of the Body.

35. For to such as are too lean and hot, Medicines less hot, and which do not
trouble the blood, ought to be given, and contrariwise, to such as are
Phlegmatic, Eat and Gold, whose Urine is thin and watery, and whose Blood is
circulated more slowly; Medicaments more hot are to be administered.

36. In a more hot temperament, the following Corroberatives may be exhibited.
Take Conserve of Betony Flowers, Tamarisk, Male Peony, Species Diamargariton
frigidum, a dram and a half: powder of Peony roots, and seeds of the same, of
each a Dram: red Coral prepared, Salt of Wormwood, of each two drams: Vitrol of
Steel, two scruples: Juice of Oranges, enough to make an Electuary: Take a dram
of it, twice or thrice a day, drinking after it a draught of this following
Julep.

37. Take shavings, of Ivory and Hartshorn, of each three drams: roots of
Chervil, Burdock, Valerian, each half an Ounce: leaves of Betony, Gout-Ivy, or
Ground Pine, Hart's-tongue, Tops of Tamarisk, of each an handful: Barks of
Tamarisk and Amara dulcis, of each half an ounce: Water, two quarts: boil to
the consumption of a third, add white Wine, eight ounces: strain them into a
pitcher; to which add Brooklime, Cresses, of each a handful: infuse close and
warm for four hours: strain and keep it close stopped in Glasses. Dose six
ounces: After the aforesaid Electuary, or some of the following Pouders.

38. Take Red Coral with juice of Oranges beaten together in a Mortar and
dried, half an ounce; powder of Misleto of the Oak, of male Peony-root, of each
two drams: sugar pearled, 3 drams: make a powder: Dose one Scruple to half a
dram twice or thrice a day.

39. Take species Diamargariton frigidum, two drams, salt of Wormwood, 3 drams:
root of Wake-Robin in powder, one dram: mix and make up a powder for twenty
doses; one in the Morning, and one at four in the Afternoon; or take of the
Roots of Butterbur an ounce or two: make them into fine Powder: dose half a
dram to a dram twice a day.

40. Take leaves of Burdock and Wake-Robin of each six handfulls: Cut and mix
them, and distill, a dose of the water, 2 or 3 drams twice or thrice a day:
After any of the former Pouders.

41. Take of the Water of Walnuts and Black Cherries, of each half a pint;
snail-water; three ounces; syrup of male Peony-flowers, 2 ounces: Dose one
ounce and half or 2 ounces twice or thrice a day: Moreover in the summertime
the use of Spaw-water is convenient, or for want of them, such as are
artificially prepared.

42. Hitherto of the Medicaments to be used in a hot Constitution: In a cold
Temperament the following things are more Excellent: Take Conserves of
Rosemary, of the yellow of Orange and Limons, of each 2 ounces, of Lignum
Aloes, of yellow Sanders, of the roots of snake-Weed, Contrayerva, Angelica,
Cucupint, each one dram, with what will suffice of candied Walnuts, make an
Electuary: Let it be taken twice a day, to the quantity of a Nutmeg, drinking
after it a dose of appropriate Liquor.

43. Take of the Roots of male Peony, Angelica, and red Coral prepared, each 2
drams, of sugar dissolved in the water of Snails: boiled to the Consistency of
Tablets, 6 ounces: of the oil of Amber lightly rectified, half a dram: make a
sufficient quantity of Lozenges, each weighing about half a dram, take one or
two twice or thrice a day, drinking after it a dose of proper Liquorice.

44. Take of the Roots of Virginian snake-weed, Contrayerva, Valerian, each two
drams: of red Coral, and prepared Pearl, each one dram, of Winteran Bark and of
the root of Cretian Dittany, each one dram: of the Vitriol of steel, and salt
of Wormwood, each one dram and half: of extract of Centaury, two drams; of
Ammoniacum dissolved in hysteric water, a sufficient quantity to make a
pilulary Mass: of which take 4 Pills in the morning, and at four in the
Afternoon.

45. Take of the spirit of Hartshorn, or soot or humane blood, or of sal
Armoniack, a sufficient quantity, take of them from 10 to 12 drops Morning and
Evening in a spoonful of Jallap: drinking a small draught of the same after it.

46. Take of the Leaves of Betony, Vervain, Sage, Lady's-smocks, Cocowpint,
Burdock, of each two handfuls, of green Wallnuts numb. 20. the Rinds of six
Oranges and four Limons, of Cardamoms and Cubebs of each one Ounce: being cut
and bruised, pour on them of whey made of Cider or White wine, six pints:
distill them according to Art. The Dose 2 ounces to 3 twice a day, after a Dose
of a solid Medicine you may add to one quart of this Liquor two drams our Steel.

47. Take of the water of Snails and of Earthworms, each six ounces, Walnuts
simple, 4 ounces; of Radish compound, two ounces, of white sugar two ounces;
make a Julep. The Dose 4 or 6 spoonfuls, twice in a day, after a dose of a
solid Medicine.

48. Take of Millepedes or Hog-Lice cleansed, one pint, of Cloves cut half an
ounce, put to them one quart of White Wind let them be distilled in a glass
Cucurbit: The dose one ounce to an ounce and half twice a day.

49. For the poorer sort of People, Medicines not difficult to be prepared, may
be prescribed after this manner: Take of the Conserves of the leaves of Rue,
made with an equal proportion of sugar, six Drams, take thereof the quantity of
a Nutmeg twice a day, Drinking after it of the Decoction of the seeds and roots
of Burdock, in Whey or posset drink made of white wind.

50. Or, there may be prepared a Conserve of the leaves of the tree of Life
with a like portion of Sugar: Dose half a dram to one dram twice a day: or,
Take of Millepedes prepared, 3 drams; of Ameos seeds, one dram, make a powder:
Divide it into ten parts, take a dose twice a day, or twelve sows, or Wood-lice
bruised, and White Wind, put to them, let the Juice be wrung out, make a
Draught, let it be taken twice a day.

51. Now whilst these Medicines are inwardly taken, it will not be amiss
sometimes to raise Blisters with Vesicatories in the nape of the Neck, and
behind the Ears; for so the serous and sharp humors are very much drained from
the head.

52. Besides Sneezing pouders, and such as expurgate Rheum from the head often
afford very considerable help.

53. The drawing away of Blood from the Hemorrhoidal Veins of the Foot, should
sometimes be repeated; yea, and the Distemper requiring, Plasters and
Cataplasms are advantagiously applied to the Soles of the Feet: It is also
profitable to apply drawing Medicines about the Calves and Thighs. Willis, de
Convulsivis Cap. 5. Observe. 5.

The Chapter of the Vertigo continued. Numb. 20.

L. A Vertigo with troublesome sleeps.

1. John Elinger, fifteen or sixteen years of Age, was taken with a Vertigo;
and every Night he vehemently cried out, for that he was troubled with terrible
things in his Sleep, as if he should fall from some high Mountain.

2. He was delighted in drinking of sharp or austere Wine; and oftentimes
suffered a relaxation of the Uvula, and moreover he was afflicted with a
vehement pain of the Head, so that he was forced to keep his Bed for two days
together.

3. His Urine was very Choleric, thick, troubled, full of Sediment; and a
Spume or froth on the Crown thereof.

4. I prescribed him the following Julep, to be taken in three Mornings
fasting: Take Syrup of Staechas, syrup of Succory with Rhubarb, of each two
ounces: Oxymel simple, Honey of Roses strained, of each six drams: Aqua Langij,
one ounce: Waters of Endive and sorrel, of each two ounces: Vervain and
Rose Water, of each one ounce and half: mix them for a Julep.

5. Afterward these following Pills: Take Pilulae Arabicae, one dram: with
syrup of Staechas make nine Pills: They profit much: and in the heat of Summer
he took this mixture: Take Conserves of Roses and of Wood Sorrel, of each an
ounce mix them.

6. Notwithstanding he had all this while a notable weakness in his Limbs, with
a Griping of the Bowels, and pain of the Head, besides his Vertigo, so that he
was not able to Rise from his Bed; also he was bound in his Bowels for four
days past, with a very great Thirst.

7. I prescribed this Decoction following with Prunes: Take of the best Sena,
Raisons, of each one ounce: white Tartar, two drams: three of the Cordial
flowers, Roses excepted, of each one Pugil: seeds of Anise and Fennel, of each
one dram: Ginger, five drams: Mallows, Herb Mercury, flowers of Camomil, of
each one handful; Water a sufficient quantity, make a Decoction with Prunes.

8. For the Comforting of his whole Body, he used this following gross Powder:
Take the Aromatic species (I suppose he means Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs and
Cinnamon) cut small, two ounces: Coriander, Comfits, Lozenges of Diarrhodon
Abbatis, and of Diamargariton frigidum, Citron Peels candied, of each five
ounces: mix all well together, and make a gross Powder by beating in a Mortar:
By the use of these Remedies he was made perfectly well. Gabelchoveri Cent. 4.
Observe. 1.

LI. A Vertigo arising by consent from the Stomach.

1. A Senator of Herrenberg, twenty eight years of Age, complained of a
Vertigo, which he plainly perceived to arise from Vapors ascending from his
Stomach to his Head.

2. Of other parts of his Body he made no complaints: his Urine was well
colored and frothy.

3. I prescribed him these following Pills: Take Pilulae Aggregativae, one
dram, Diagredium, three grains: with syrup of Staechas make fifteen Pills: the
which he swallowed with six drams of Syrup of Roses Solutive.

4. Morning and Evening he washed his Feet in the following Decoction: Take
Aron leaves, Thyme, Ground Ivy, Camomil flowers, Watercresses, boil all in a
sufficient quantity of Water, to wash with.

5. In his Food he used Powder of Nutmegs, and going to Bed he eat
Carraway-seeds, moistened in Vinegar of Roses and dried again. By the use of
these things with a Regular Diet, he was in a few days made well. Gabelchoveri,
Cent. 4. Observe. 56.

LII. A Vertiginous disposition, with other Symptoms.

1. A Noble Youth about eleven years of Age, being afflicted from his Infancy
with an Imbecility and weakness of the Head, was at a certain time taken so
ill after Sleep w th the abovenamed Distempers, together with a Stupefaction of
the parts of Motion, that he was not able to hold his Head upright.

2. Sometimes after Eating he was seized with the sudden Dejection of his
Strength, a pain in his Eyes, and a darkness of his Sight; his whole Body was
consumed with an Atrophia, his Urine was crude, the pain of his Belly great,
his Appetite was but small, without heat, and thirst, and his Pulse but slow.

3. Now the Reason, or rather the Cause from whence this Imbecility or Weakness
of the Head did proceed is, for as much as there is a Penury or lake of Spirits
by their Refluctuation to their proper Fountain and Center, and that occasioned
by Sleep, they are not so quickly and readily distributed and diffused again
through the Organs of the Senses.

4. There was a kind of Stupefaction upon all the parts of Motion, because they
need and require a greater flowing in of the Spirits than the Organs of the
Senses, from whence we may perceive that the same part having the same Nerves
oftentimes can Retain the Sense without Motion.

5. The contrary whereof falls not out, unless there be one Nerve to
Communicate Motion, and another to Communicate Sense, which thing is manifest
in the fabric of the Eyes.

6. Why there was a sudden Dejection of the Strength after Eating appears from
this, the native heat being so weak as not to digest the Food, Communicated
crude Exhalations to the Principal parts, which serve the Animal and Vital
Facultys, where chiefly in the Brain this accession of Weakness was bred, as in
that part least Capable to bear external Injuries, because of the want and
Penury of the Spirits.

7. There was also a pain of the Eyes, with a darkness of the Sight, whereas
this Evil did arise by consent of the Ventricle, affecting with pain sooner the
foreparts than the hinder parts, perhaps because the Brain is more Capacious,
and soft, and so more fit to Receive the Impression of Vapors.

8. And there chiefly the Emunctores do concur to the separation of the
Heterogenous matter, from whence also a dark Sight is not difficully
demonstrated; while the weaker Animal Spirits are whirled about contrary to
their Nature by the flowing in of the crude Exhalations.

9. The whole being consumed with an Atrophia, did proceed from the Imbecility
of the Concoction of the Bowels, from whence came the crude Urine, and Blood
not rightly digested nor separated from the Excrementitious parts.

10. The pains of his Belly did arise from Wind generated by a weak heat, his
slender Appetite did proceed from the Coldness of his Stomach, which always
craves more than it can digest; and he was without any great heat and Thirst,
which may be ascribed to the Liver, which was of a cold Temper; his Pulse was
but small, because of the want of Exercise, the softness of the Artery, and the
Strength of the Vital faculty.

11. All these Circumstances being considered; We must have a Respect, in the
next place, to the Indications of the Disease. First, That the Imbecility of
Concoction be helped. Secondly, That the Head and the several Nerves be
Corroberated. And Thirdly, That the peccant Cause which is Received into the
Head, may be taken away.

12. As to the first Intention, I prescribe before all things, a light
Evacuation by Manna, dissolved in Broth of Prunes, one ounce and a half: and
because of the bad Diet, which is the Cause of the Excess of Calidity and
Siccity, we principally commend such things, as may impede Vapors from
ascending to the Head after Meat, and such as will help Concoction, viz. the
following Electuary.

13. Take of Conserve of old Roses, one ounce and half: Diacidonium simplex,
half an ounce: the spirit of Vitriol, seven Drops; the syrup of Mint, a
sufficient quantity, make a soft Electuary, and take the quantity of a Wallnut
thereof after Meat.

14. Or in the place thereof, take this Digestive and Comforting Powder, viz.
Coriander prepared, half an ounce: Aromaticum Rosatum tabulated, two drams: the
seeds of Fennel and Anise, of each one dram: Nutmegs and Orange peel, of each
half a dram: Sugar to the weight of them all, make a Ponder, and take thereof
half a dram, with White-bread Toasted, and afterward moistened in Malmsey, or
old Wine.

15. Now as to the second Intention, we appointed the following Rowls for the
Head: Take species Diamoschi dulcis, one dram: Oil of Nutmegs by Expression,
one scruple: Oil of white Amber, three drops: Ambergrise, four grains, and
Sugar dissolved in the Water of Lavender flowers, four ounces: make a
Confection in Rowls, to be taken two or three at a time on a fasting Stomach.

16. We commend to be outwardly applied, the Apoplectick water distilled with
Castoreum, in which the following Nodule is to be infused: Take of the leaves
of Marjoram, Sage, and the flowers of Lavender, of each half a handful: Mace
prepared in Vinegar, Cubebs, Nutmegs, of each half a dram: Camphir, three
grains: make a gross Powder to be contained in a Nodule, wherewith the
Backbone is to be Rubbed.

17. We have also exhibited with good Success one Spoonful of the following
Corroberating Syrup: Take of the syrup of the Juice of Citrons and of Betony,
of each one ounce and half: the Water of Borage, one ounce: the Water of
Cinnamon, half an ounce: mix them.

18. Lastly, As to the third Intention, we ordered a light Evacuation to be
used at certain Seasons, for taking away the serous matter from the other parts
of the Body, such is the effect of the syrup of Buckthorn, and a Vesicatory
Plaster was also applied, by these few Remedies this Noble Youth was perfectly
Cured in the space of fourteen days, and has never as yet complained of the
like Symptoms. Ex Greg. Horstij Tom. 2. lib. 2 Observe. 23.

LIII. Another Vertiginous Distemper.

1. A certain worthy Gentleman at a distance, acquainted me in a Letter, with
his Condition, which was as follows; He was afflicted for two years with a very
stubborn and contumatious Flux of Blood, from which after he had been half a
year freed, the same returned again; and with it he had at length a Vertigo.

2. As to the Flux of Blood, he was for the most part eased by the help of some
famous Physicians; he complained of Exhalations and Vapors in the Head, and of
a Watery kind of Phlegm running often out of his Mouth, together with a thick
and gross Cloudiness in the Head, and the Obfuscation of his Sight.

3. My Opinion was, That this Flux was Hepatick, or of the Liver, by which the
Strength became Weak and did languish, the effect of which, was the Scotomy,
and that Vertiginous affect.

4. Now besides moderate and convenient Diet, I ordered him for the
strengthening the Natural Powers of Concoction, to take often the Powder of
Rhubarb cut in pieces, with a little of the Cream of Tartar, in the Broth or
Decoction of Prunes, which is to be used once every Week, to the weight of one
dram, a few drops of the Oil of Fennel being sprinkled thereon.

5. On the other days he may use early in the Morning, red Coral one dram, with
the Decoction of the Roots of Succory and Fennel, and to this end, the Elixir
Proprietatis well prepared will help much, being well tempered by a convenient
Digestion, from the Acrimony of the acid Spirit of Sulphur, of which he may
take once and again eight or nine drops two hours, both before Dinner and
Supper.

6. Or he may take two or three spoonfuls of Wine of Rosemary, at the aforesaid
times; for the strengthening of the Head.

7. Let him take a small Portion of the following Morsels immediately before
Sleep, viz. old Conserve of Roses, Mastich, Olibanum, the Extract of the Wood
of Aloes, Nutmegs, the Oils of Fennel and Mace, a sufficient quantity of Sugar
dissolved in Fennel Water being added.

8. The Elixir Proprietatis, and the Essence of the root of Succory, reduced by
Digestion to a pleasant Sweetness, will be very commodious and profitable to
the Liver.

9. I cannot disapprove of the Decoction of the Wood of the Lentisk tree, with
Sanders, and the Conserves of Wormwood and Rhubarb, they being also good for
the Liver, and which were prescribed by the famous Prevotius. Ex Greg. Horstij
Tom. 2. lib. 2. Observe. 24.

LIVE. A Vertigo Concomitant with other Diseases.

1. The Wife of Ludovicus Serrays, being Vertiginous, Paralytick, Comatose,
Hysteric, Nephritick, etc. with her Mouth awry, being called to her, she could
scarce speak to me: I prescribed the following Purging Pills.

2. Take Resin of Jallap, Agarick, Aloes, of each four grains: Salt of Amber,
six grains: Oil of Mint two drops: mix them and make five gilded Pills: being
very well purged with this she was much better.

3. The next day she took of the following mixtures by Spoonfuls: Take of Our
Prophylactick Water an ounce and half: Antiparalytick Water an ounce: Bawm
Water three ounces: syrup of Staechas, one ounce: mix them by shaking in a
Glass.

4. Using of this she complained of its sharpness: but the Hysteric Passion
admits of no Sweetness; yet she liked it very well being mixed with an ounce and
half of Water of Lilly Convally; and within nine, yea within seven days, she
was perfectly Cured; for in the fourth day after, this Virtuous Martha took
care of her Family. Prax. Barbetti, lib. 1. cap. 3. sect. 2.

Out of Gregorius Horstius for the Vertigo.
1. Take Cardamoms, grains of Paradise; let them be often chewed; or Poudred
and taken in Broth.

2. Take Cubebs six or seven grains, bruise them, and steep them for a Night in
three ounces of Wine; and strain, and drink it the next Morning.

3. Take Powder of Ey-bright, with the flowers, half an ounce: Mace prepared
with Vinegar one ounce: Coriander seeds a dram and half: Betony a scruple:
Cubebs, half a scruple: Sugar Candy, six drams: make a Powder: of which take a
dram in a Glass of Mallago Wine and a Tossed.

4. Take Chemical Oils of Fennel and Anise seed, of each three grains: mix
them, and give them in a little Broth.

5. Take Powder of Southernwood, a dram: Oxymel, one ounce: mix them, and give
it against the Vertigo, in a moist and cold Constitution.

6. Take species Diambrae, Diamoschu of each one dram: Aromaticum Rosatum, half
a dram: red Coral, and white Amber both prepared, of each sixteen grains:
Cardamoms, Nutmegs, Mace, of each a scruple: Sugar, five ounces: with
Rose Water make a Confection in Rowls: adding toward the End Chemical Oils of
Fennel and Anniseeds, of each six drops.

7. Take Pearls prepared one dram: Oil of Cloves six drops distilled: Oil of

10. Take species Diamoschi Dulcis one dram: Chemical Oil of Nutmegs, one
scruple: Oil of white Amber three grains: Sugar dissolved in Lavender Water,
three ounces: make a Confection in Rowls.

11. Also to this purpose the Essences of Amber, and Ambergrise are famous, so
also the Powder of Native Cinnabar Compound, together with the Lixivium and
Balsam of Agricola, Peacocks-dung, is a great specific in this Case.

12. Take Water of Swallows, Water of Castoreum, of each a spoonful, mix them
for a Dose.

13. Take Misleto of the Oak, two drams: Root of Male Peony, three drams: seeds
of the same, one dram: red and white Coral levigated, of each half a dram:

Dose one dram, with the Water Lilly Convally.

14. Take Chemical Oil of Carraways three grains: Ambergrise in Powder, four
grains: Sugar a sufficient quantity, give it in black Cherry-water.

15. Take white Amber: species Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each a dram and half:
Ambergrise four grains: (but half a dram would do better) make a Powder: Dose
half a dram.

16. Outwardly, Take Powder of Silkworms, which mix with Dears fat, and Ducks
grease: let the Head be anointed therewith. Ex Horstij, Tom. 3. Page 194.

SCHOLIA. Theoretical Considerations upon the Cure of the VERTIGO.
By W. Salmon, the Author hereof.
LVI. The Pathology of the Vertigo, and first of the Notation thereof.

1. THe Name. (...) Graece, Vertigo, Latin, The Swimming of the Head,
Giddiness, or Turning of the Brain, in English.

2. The Definition. The Vertigo is a Disease in the Cavities of the Brain,
chiefly the Foremost, in which the Animal Spirits are disturbed by a
preternatural Exagitation and Commotion, so that all things seem to turn round,
by which the Sick is taken with a certain Swimming, or Giddiness of the Head,
causing them to stagger, or reel, and sometimes to fall, yet not depriving them
either of Sense or Motion.

3. The kinds. It is twofold, one Simple, called in Greek (...), wherein the
Sight remains unhurt, the other is Complex, called in Greek (...), and (...),
wherein Sight is Darkened, as it were with a Mist or Cloud.

LVII. The Signs of the Vertigo.

1. The Signs whereby a Vertigo is known, is a Giddiness in the Head or Brain,
for the most part without pain; in which all things seem, as it were, to turn
round; sometimes with a gentle Motion, sometimes with a rapid.

2. When the Motion is gentle, the Sick seldom falls; only a little Staggers,
as it were, and is confounded in his Mind by a certain kind of Amazement, from
the sudden Exagitation of the Animal Spirits, so that if he be walking, he
knows not where he is, but must be forced to stand still to Consult the place
of his present Station, whether he is a going; and what is the occasion.

3. For that a strange kind of Forgetfulness does seize him, notwithstanding
all this while his internal Senses are not so disturbed, but that he knows he
is about business, though the particulars be forgotten, which after a little
pause, he Recollects again, and becomes perfectly well.

4. Sometimes, as is aforesaid, this affect is accompanied with dimness or
darkness of the Sight; in which Case, not only all the other Symptoms are
existent, but the Circumvolution, or Rotation of things seems to be with a
great Violence or Vehemence; insomuch, that when the Paroxism seizes, the Sick
must necessarily fall, unless that he catches hold of any thing, whereby he
might support himself.

5. It is known a little before it comes by forgetfulness abovementioned, a
kind of Amazedness of Spirit, Dimness of Ey-Sight, with variety of Colors
before the Eyes, wherein things seem to be double or treble cut; presently
after all things seem to turn round, and the Sick to turn round with them.

LVIII. The Causes of a Vertigo.

1. The chief causes of a Vertigo are four; One is from a Natural weakness of
the Brain, being for the most part Hereditary from the Parents, or having been
weakened, from some Blow or Fall, or some other external Accident; whereby it is
made apt to receive the Impresons of Vapors; or from long, constant, and
violent turning Round, whereby the said Animal Spirits are Exagitated, and
brought into the like Commotion.

2. A second Cause, is from the straightness of the passages of the Brain,
wherein the Animal Spirits, moving with difficulty, and flowing with a mighty
force, by reason of the great Intentness of the Sick upon any particular
occasion, the said Passages being too straight, or narrow, by reason of some
Obstruction, and their Flux, too vehement and large, they are forced disorderly
to Retire, by which disorder and irregularity, they make a Circular Motion in
the Cavities of the Brain, whence the Paroxism is excited.

3. Now this Cause, is either Idiopathetick, to wit, in the Brain it self; or
Sympathetick, by consent from the Stomach, or some other Viscera.

4. If it be Idiopathetick, or Original in the Brain and its Cavities, the
Stomach and all other parts are generally well; the Sick Eats well, Drinks
well, Digests well, and for the most part is free from Obstructions, Pain,
Wind, or other Affections, either in the Stomach, or other Viscera.

5. An Idiopathetick Vertigo, is bred in the Brain, from a cold or moist
Humor; Or, from Water contained in the Cavities, being the Excrements of
vitiated Blood; which the more easily make an Impression thereon from the
weakness of the part.

6. And sometimes, it is caused from a Bladder of Water, contained in the
foremore Ventricle of the Brain, to which I was an Eye Witness.

7. For a person Dying of a Vertigo, accompanied with a Fever, being opened;
we found no other Cause of his Disease, nor of his Death, but a Bladder of
Water about the bigness of a small Hens Egg, lying in the foremost Ventricle of
the Brain.

8. This Man for many years had been obnoxious to a Vertigo, otherwise
constantly in perfect Health, and lived to the Age of seventy years; at first
the fits came but two or three times a year, afterward they came once a month,
and as the Man grew older and older, the Disease grew stronger, and the
Paroxisms grew more frequent, and of a longer continuance, so that he had a fit
once a Week.

9. The last Fit he complained, That all things turned round violently, and
although he leaned upon a Table, called out vehemently for some body to hold
him, for he should fall by the hasty turning round of things, he desired
forthwith to go to Bed, and whilst he lay still, he seemed to be somewhat
pacifyed; but upon the least turning of his Head, or any part of his Body, he
cried out that the Bed, and House would be turned topsy-turvy; all this was
without any Convulsion, Frenzy, or Madness, or the least appearance of a
Fever, except about four or five hours before his Death.

10. If it be Sympathetick it is by consent from some other part, as the
Indisposition of the Stomach, or other Viscera; if it be from the Stomach it is
known from the Weakness thereof, Sickness at the Stomach, want of Digestion,
Crudity, Pain and Wind afflicting that Bowel, from whence an Evil Blood is
generated; filling the Ventricles of the Brain with many Recrements.

11. Or from a fermentation of the Blood, from whence windy, or flatuous
Vapors arises, filling the said Cavities.

12. If it be caused by consent from any other part, you may know it from the
Indisposition of the said part, pain, or weakness thereof: In a Woman, if it
proceeds by consent from the Womb, she must have been troubled with affections
from the Womb, a long time beforehand.

13. A third Cause, is from a Windy Vapor generated, or arising from
Hypochondriack Melancholy; which is known by the Signs of that Distemper.

14. The fourth and last Cause, is either from the ill Confirmation of the
Cranium, and parts adjacent, wherein there may be some extuberance in the
inward Table of the Skull, compressing the Brain, or a Compressure thereof by a
Fracture of the Cranium, or a Conglutination of the Vessels of the Brain, viz.
of the Arteries or Veins; from all which causes the Animal Spirits upon the
least occasion being disturbed, excite a Vertigo.

15. It remains now, That we enquire into the Cause of the Darkness of the
Sight, which we Judge to be from Vapors or Wind vehemently assaulting the
forepart of the Brain, thereby Clouding and Confounding the Animal Spirits,
wherein the Images or appearances of things, directed to the Brain by the
Optic Nerve, are rendered unequal, and clouded, or darkened; so that there is
either a false appearance of things, as when they turn Round, or no appearance
at all, by reason of the darkning of the Sight.

16. And this is done in the Brain, by the confusion of the Animal Spirits,
through a preternatural Agitation or Commotion, and not in Eyes themselves: For
that the Spirits are inwrapped with those cloudy Vapors in the highest part of
the Brain, which gives the Original to the Optic Nerves.

LIX. The Prognostics of a Vertigo.

1. If the Disease be Retent, or in one that is Young, or if the Paroxism be
not vehement, but suddenly over, the Sick is without Danger, and the Cure may
be easily performed; the same also if it be without darkness of Sight.

2. If it be Originally in the Brain, or of any long continuance, the Paroxism
vehement, and not suddenly passing over; the Cure will be more difficult.

3. If it comes Haereditarily from the Disposition of the Parents, or from a
Native weakness of the Brain, it is for the most part without Cure.

4. So also if it arises from the ill Confirmation of the Cranium, unless the
Sick can give any particular Description of the place so afflicted, that a part
of the Skull may be taken out, whereby the Extuberance of the inward Table
Compressing the Brain, may be removed, or those windy Vapors, or
excrementitious Humors exciting a Vertigo, may be Evaporated and drawn away.

5. If it has been of long continuance, and in Aged persons, it is for the most
part Incurable; so also if it proceeds from a Bladder of Water in the
Ventricles of the Brain, unless the Skull be opened, and the said Bladder be
taken out.

6. Those afflicted with a Bladder of Water, (although out of the fit) almost
always complain of dullness and heaviness of that part of the Head where it
lies; as did the person we spoke of before, and I doubt not, if the Skull were
but timely opened, and the Bladder removed, it might be the means to save many
a Patients Life.

7. An affect not much unlike this is often seen in Calves; which when the
Countryman sees to be Vertiginous by their turning round, he commonly opens
the forepart of the Head, and by taking out a Bladder of Water, saves the Life
of his Beast, which otherwise would suddenly dye.

8. If it proceeds by consent of other parts; The Prognostics depend upon the
removing of the said Indispositions, for so long as they remain, there is no
hope of the Cure of the Vertigo.

9. If it proceeds from Hypochondriack Melancholy, or a Vapor generated in the
Brain, the Cure will be exceeding difficult to be performed: For as much, as
the Melancholy Humor is hard to Conquer or overcome.

10. In cold and moist Constitutions, it is apt to degenerate into an Apoplexy,
Epilepsy, or Lethargy.

LX. The Therapia, or Method of Cure: and first of a Simple Vertigo, or without
Dimness of Sight.

1. The Cure of a Simple Vertigo is not very difficult, and has commonly, but
two Intentions. The First, is to discuss the flatulent Spirit, troubling the
Ventricles of the Brain, or to still and quiet the too great Emanations of the
Animal Spirits: Secondly, to comfort and strengthen the Brain, hurt, or
weakened by the said flaculency and Irregularities of the Spirits.

2. The first Intention is performed, by heating Cephalicks, anointing, or
bathing the Coronal Sutures, Temples, Forehead, and Nostrils, with spirit of
Rosemary, Lavender, Carraways, Sage, Juniper, Savin, or sweet Marjoram; all
which have a mighty power to discuss any Ventosity lodged in the Cortex of the
Brain.

3. But above many other things, we commend the following, as such of which we
have had a very large Experience; first, the Powers of Rosmary; which
wonderfully Sympathize with the Brain, and strengthen all its Faculties.

4. Secondly, the Powers of Sassafras, which are indeed a great Medicine, and a
specific in this Case; the Powers of Oranges and Limons, are admirable, being
indeed partly demonstrated from their Signature; but the Powers of Nutmegs and
Amber, are Inferior to none of the former.

5. Lastly, we commend the Essences of Musk and Ambergrise above all other
things: For that they dissipate Vapors, and comfort and fortify the Brain,
above all other productions whatsoever.

6. Now the Medicaments here enumerated, as to their external use, ought to be
well bathed upon the places before mentioned, twice or thrice a day at least,
also some few drops of them may be dropped upon the Palms of the Hands, and so
drawn strongly up the Nostrils; from whence comes an Incredible relief: This if
it be done five or six times a day, it will be so much the better.

7. The second Intention, which is to comfort and fortify the weakened Brain,
to prevent for the future the Extravagancies of the Animal Spirits, is
performed for the most part by Internals, of which any of the things before
enumerated may be taken, from ten drops, to twenty, thirty, or forty, according
to the Age, Sex, and Strength of the Patient, and they may be exhibited either
in some Cephalic Water, or Cordial, or generous Wine.

8. But for as much, as Musk and Ambergrise are thought Inimical to Women
troubled with Vapors, or subject to Hysteric fits; we here forbid their
external use to the Head, or upper parts.

9. Inwardly, they may be thus given: Take Musk, twelve grains: Ambergrise,
five grains: Peacocks Dung, a scruple: Venice Treacle, half a dram: mix, and
make a Bolus to be given every Night going to bed; drinking after it one ounce
or two of good Cinnamon Water.

10. This alone Medicament transcends al others, in most cold and moist
Diseases of the Head and Brain, especially in Vertigo's, Epilepsies,
Lethargies, and other Drowsy-Diseases; for it comforts and restores the
profligated Animal Spirits, almost to a Miracle.

11. We could prescribe many other things of great Power and Virtue, truly
efficacious for this purpose; but do here forbear, knowing this last Medicine
to transcend them all.

12. Moreover we can speak upon true and certain Experience, that we have not
only Cured many of the Vertigo herewith, but also several supposed Incurable
Hystericks: Women that for the space of twenty or thirty years have been
continually vexed with those Fits, and lived without hope of Cure, the effect
has been so admirable, that the said Hysteric fits, have never returned any
more.

LX. The Cure of a Vertigo, with Dimness or Loss of Sight.

1. The Indications of Cure are threefold: first, to discuss so much as may be
the matter, and to quiet the wandering Spirits: the second Intention is to
remove the Conjunct Cause, and to take it away by Revulsion and Derivation:
thirdly, to remove the Procatartick Cause, and to strengthen the part afflicted.

2. As to first Intention, for discussion, the things prescribed in the former
Section against a Simple Vertigo, may be very profitable here: but if the
strongest of those Remedies prevail not, you may after the use of them apply
this following Cataplasm: Take Barley Meal, a pound: Oil of Roses, three
ounces: Poppy-water, enough to make it of the thickness of a Pultise: to which
add Opium, half an Ounce; first dissolved in the spirit of Wine, and then
inspissated to the thickness of Honey.

3. If the former cannot be had, you may apply this: Take Barley Meal, a pound:
Oil of Roses, four ounces: white Poppy seeds well bruised, three ounces: boil
all in a sufficient quantity of Poppy water, to the consistence of a Pultise:
which apply to the Temples and Forehead; and if the Head be shaved, it may be
applied over the whole Head.

4. Now to quiet the irregular Motion of the Spirits: If the Disease be
inveterate and vehement, and will yield to no common Remedies; you may give a
few grains of Laudanum, beginning first with two grains, and increasing of it
half a grain, every third day, till you come to five, six, or seven grains.

5. Or, if you would rather use a Liquid Laudanum, as those of Helmont
Scheffer, or any other; you may begin with ten drops, and so increase the Dose
three or four drops, every third day till it come to thirty or forty.

6. The second Intention, is for removing the Conjunct Cause; which is done,
first, by Derivation, and that either with Emeticks, or Catharticks.

7. If the Stomach be foul Emeticks take the first place; you may exhibit in
the Morning fasting this: Take Vinum Benedictum, six drams: Salt of Vitriol,
two scruples, mix, dissolve, and then give it; It Works admirably, and may give
the Patient six, eight, or ten, easy Vomits, according to the foulness of the
Stomach; the use of this Medicine, I cannot but Commend, having Cured several
of a Scotoma, by twice or thrice exhibiting it alone, without any other thing.

8. Some commends the flowers of Antimony, and doubtless being Corrected, they
are a good Medicament; others, Crocus Metallorum given in substance from three
to six grains: others, Vitrum Antimonij, from one grain to three; and some set
a great value on Mercurius Vitae, given from half a grain to three, well
prepared.

9. But before all these later things, the Emetick Tartar of Mynsicht is to be
preferred, given from three grains to six in a glass of Sack.

10. Paracelsus mightily commends the Salt of Vitriol, which may be given from
two scruples, to a dram and half, according to Age and Strength; he says, It is
a specific in all Vertiginous and Epileptick Diseases; and truly Experience
has often confirmed it.

11. For weaker Constitutions, and such as are fearful to take Antimonials,
Vinum scilliticum, and Oxymel scilliticum, are given with good success, from
one ounce to two ounces and half, either alone, or mixed with half a dram of
Sal Vitrioli.

12. After the Exhibition of Vomits, twill be necessary to carry the matter
downwards by proper Catharticks; among the number of which, of Pills he may
take Pilulae Agregativae, de Agarico, Cochiae, Aureae, Rudij, or Our Family
Pills, either with, or without Aloes.

13. The following Composition is mightily approved of: Take Pilulae
Aloephanginae, Coch ae, ex duobus, of each a dram: Resin of Jallap, half a
dram: Chemical Oil of Lavender, or of sweet Marjoram, twelve drops: syrup of
Buck-thorn, enough to make it into a mass of Pills: Dose from a scruple to half
a dram early in the Morning, with good Government: Here the Pilulae Lunares
have place, which may be given twice a Week, a gr. iij ad viij, they are a
specific.

14. Those that cannot take Pills, may take the Species Sanctae, half a dram;
or the Pulvis ex tribus, which carries off the cold, pituitous Humor after an
admirable manner.

15. To weak Constitutions you may give Benedicta Laxativa, from three to six
drams; So also Carocostinum, Electuarium Amarum Magistral majus, Diacarthamum,
or Catholicon, which last, may be given from six drams to one ounce and half.

16. But above all to strong Bodies, we commend Confect. Hamech, which may be
given from three drams to six, mix with half an ounce of Electuarium Lenitivum,
and so taken in White or Rhenish Wine.

17. Those that cannot take solid things, may take the following Liquids:
Decoctum Epithymi compound, is of singular use, given to four ounces in the
Morning fasting: Or this, Take Decoctum Epithymi, two ounces and half: syrup of
Buckthorn, an ounce and half: mix them, to be taken in the Morning fasting.

18. In a more cold Constitution, the Vinum Antepilepticum Mynsichti, or the
Vinum Purgans Mynsichti, either of them taken from two ounces, to four in the
Morning fasting twice a Week, are of excellent use in this Cure.

19. To these add the Tinctura Cathartica Clossaei; Tinctura Cathartica Mylij,
Tinctura Catholica and Phlegmagoga Grulingij, Tinctura Senae Composita,
Tinctura Cathartica Magistralis, and our Catharticum Argenteum, all which are
of singular use in the Cure of an inveterate Scotoma.

20. But in the mean season, while these Derivations are making, you are to
consider the State of the Bowels: If the body be costive, you may exhibit the
Enema specificum Mynsichti, Enema pituitum purgans, or Enema in Capitis
Affectibus Mynsichti, or this following: Take Herb Mercury, Beets, Mallows,
Wormwood, Betony, Centory the less: flowers of Camomil and Dill, of each half
an handful; bruise and boil all in a sufficient quantity of Water, to the
Consumption of the half; strain, and to fourteen ounces thereof add Oil Olive,
and Oil of Dill, of each one ounce and half: Honey of Roses one ounce: Hiera
simple, two ounces: Salt, a dram, mix and make a Clyster, to be given warm,
which exhibit with a Clyster Syringe.

21. For Derivation, Cupping-glasses may be applied to the Shoulders, or Hips,
with or without Scarification, or in the place thereof, you may apply
Vesicatories and Cauteries, to both the Soles of the Feet, which derive the
matter from the Head wonderfully.

22. If the Head be stuffed with many Excrements, you may use Errhines either
Solid or Liquid, also such Masticatories, as we speak of, in in the Cure of the
Headache, from a cold and moist Temperature.

23. However the Juice of Sweet Marjoram, may be used without Exception, or a
dram of the Powder of Euphorbium, dissolved in a quart or somewhat more of
White Wine; it makes an Evacuation above Imagination, and causes a strong
derivation of the Humors by the Nostrils.

24. Now here is to be considered, Whether the Disease is of it self, or
Complicate with the Scurvey, or any other Disease? In these Cases, you must
always mix with your Medicaments in their Preparation, Antiscorbuticks, or
other Medicaments proper against the Disease Concomitant.

25. Dr. Willis commends this following: Take Pilulae de succino, twenty five
grains: Resin of Jallap, six grains: Tartar Vitriolated, seven grains: Balsam
of Peru, enough to make them into four Pills, to be taken at Night going to
bed, or early the next Morning.

26. His Vomit is this: Take sulphur of Antimony, five grains: Cream of Tartar,
ten grains: Castoreum, two grains; make a Powder, which take with good
Government.

27. The third Intention, is for removing the Procatartick Cause, this is done
by observing a good Diet, such as may not generate Wind or Vapors, nor breed
cold, moist, and pituitous Humors, his Drink ought to be a small ordinary
Decoction of Guajacum; for that Authors affirm, to be a specific in the Curing
of the most Inveterate Vertigo; If the Sick at any time drinks Wine, let it be
either Canary, or Rhenish, wherein the Powers of Rosemary, or Wormwood have
been droped, from 15, to 30 or 40 drops.

28. In the Morning fasting, he may take one of the following Medicaments: Take
Conserve of Male-Peony flowers, six ounces: Powder of the Root of the same, one
ounce: Powder of the seeds of the same, two drams: Amber, Coral, Pearls
levigated, two drams and half: Salt of Coral, a dram; with the syrup of Coral,
a sufficient quantity, make an Electuary: Dose two drams Morning and Evening;
Drinking after it about three ounces of this following distilled Water: Take of
the fresh leaves of Tree Misleto, six handfuls: the Roots of Male-Peony,
Angelica, of each a pound and half: white Peacocks dung, two pound: Cardamoms
bruised, two ounces, Castoreum, three drams: Let all be cut small, and bruised,
to which affuse White Wine, or Whey made with White Wine, eight pound; distill
to dryness, mixing all the Liquors together.

29. This following Electuary has been used with great success: Take Conserves
of Rosemary flowers, five ounces: Conserves of the Flowers of Sage and Betony,
of each one ounce and half: Powder of Male Peony roots and seed, of each one
ounce: two Preserved Nutmegs: Powder of a dead man's skull, Misletoe of the Oak,
of each one ounce and half: native Cinnabar levigated, three drams: syrup of
Male Peony-flowers, enough to make it into an Electuary: Dose two drams,
Morning and Evening.

30. Tincture of Luna, may be given from six to sixteen drops in Rhenish Wine,
or Black Cherry-water.

31. Doctor Willis commends the following Tables: Take Powder of Male Peony
Root, half an ounce: Red Coral prepared, species Diambrae, of each two drams
and half: Powder of Male Peony flowers, one dram; mix them, to which add white
Sugar ten ounces, dissolve them in Peony Water, and boil them to a height;
making Lozenges, weighing half a dram a piece: let one or two of them be eaten
often in a day.

32. Take Powder of Male Peony roots, one ounce and half: Powder of the seeds
of the same; Coral, and white Amber levigated, of each three drams: Pearls
levigated, Powder of the Flowers of Male Peony fresh gathered, bruised and
dried in the Sun, of each two drams: Sugar Candy, one ounce, mix them; let a
dram of this Powder be taken twice a day, with a draught of Tea, or a draught
of the Decoction of Sage and Rosemary sweetened.

33. For poor people, Willis orders this: Take Powder of the leaves of Misleto
dried in the Sun, let it be given a dram at a time twice a day: or, Take
whitest dung of Peacocks in Powder, six ounces: Powder of Male Peony Roots, one
ounce: Sugar, two ounces; mix them: Dose a Spoonful twice a Day, in some
convenient Liquor.

34. For this Intention also the Volatile Salts and Spirits of sal Armoniack,
Soot, Hartshorn, Elks-hoof, and Man's skull; are of great use, for they nourish
and comfort the Brain, and Animal Spirits; and destroy all those things, which
would any ways obfuscate, cloud, or trouble them.

35. To these may be added Tinctures of Coral and Antimony, which have a great
prevalency; so also the Tincture of Peacocks Dung, drawn with the rectified
Spirit of Wine; some mightily commend Chalybeats, as syrup of Steel, Tincture
of Steel, and such like; to which may be added the Volatile spirit of the
Vitriol of Steel; all these things to be exhibitted in proper Cephalicks.

36. Our Epileptick Powder, inferior to none of the former, may be given twice
a day, and is made as follows: Take Musk, one dram: Powder of Male Peony Roots,
of Man's skull, of Rosemary flowers, Ambergrise, of each half a dram: salt of
Amber, Volatile Salt of Peacocks Dungs, salt of Hartshorn, native Cinnabar,
choice Civet, of each a scruple, mix them in fine Powder. Dose from twelve
grains, to a scruple or more once a day: especially in the Morning fasting.

37. If the Disease be stubborn and Inveterate and the Paroxisms often return;
the said Pouders may be taken Morning and Night.

38. If the Vertigo proceeds from a Windy Vapor, besides what we have already
prescribed, the Sutures of the Head, ought to be anointed with Chemical Oils of
Rosemary, or Sassafras; mixed with Civet, and the following Dose is to be given
at Night going to Bed: Take Laudanum, from three to five grains: Ambergrise,
five grains: Musk, ten grains; make it into one or 2 Pills, with Balsam of
Peru, or Liquid storax.

39. If it arises by consent from the Stomach, after evacuating and cleansing
of the Stomach, as aforesaid; you may give every Morning, or Noon, before
Eating, forty drops of the Elixir Proprietatis; or as much of the Powers or
Tinctures of Common Wormwood; for that they fortify the Stomach exceedingly,
and prevent the generation of Winds and Vapors.

40. If it rises from the Womb, or any other part; you must have Respect to
those Symptoms, and parts concomitantly affected; of which we shall say nothing
here: Save in all Hysteric Cases, we commend the Bolus at 9. in the former
Section, to be two or three times or more repeated: Or, The Epileptick Powder,
at. 36. aforegoing: Or the Pills of Musk and Ambergrise, at. 38. but even now
described; than which there are but very few things superior. See more hereof
in Our Synopsis Medicinae, lib. 3. cap. 29. sect. 4. of the last Edition.

CHAP. IV. Of a CATARRH.
The Authors Observations.
I. OF a Catarrh, with a great Tumor of the Throat, Fever, Hoemorrhoids, etc.

1. When I began this Work, I thought of an uninterrupted continuation thereof,
to the perfecting the same: But it pleased the most Wise God to deal otherwise
with me, and for a season to put a stop to this my Design; for being seized for
some Weeks with a Catarrh, at last I was taken on Wednesday the 16 of August
1681. with the Piles, or Hoemorrhoids, in so vehement a manner, as that in two
hours time, they were as big outwardly, as a small bunch of Grapes, a thing not
only unnatural, but almost past all belief: The vehemence of their pain excited
a Lypirias, or continual Symptomatick Burning Fever, and a strong binding up
of the Bowels, together with a great Tumor of the whole Collum, chiefly of the
Tonsillae, Columna, Larynx, Pharinx, and parts adjacent.

2. The Author hereof, is the object of this Observation. I have lived for more
than twenty years, with as much Moderation and Temperance, I think, as any body
else could do; for in all that long time, I never took more Physic, than one
single Purge of Sena: if there was any inequality of my Habit of Body, it was
inclinable to cold and moisture; and something of late to Melancholy, which
caused a kind of Pining or wasting away of my Flesh: Whether it should arise
from any Grief of Mind, or my Sedentary Course of Life, I cannot easily
determine; It might be doubtless from them both; this I take to be as the
prime, first, or remote natural Cause.

3. What farther helped on my Disease, as far as I can apprehend, was taking of
cold, by sitting 2 or 3 hours in a Cellar drinking with a Friend a Bottle or
two of Cider; after the Drinking of which, in about two hours time, as
aforesaid, I was afflicted with the Piles, (a Disease I was formerly subject
to, and which I commonly Cured before breaking, with once, or twice anointing
with Oil of Amber, though now it would do me no Service) and in about two hours
after their beginning they were miraculously increased, to the bigness of a
small bunch of Grapes, to which bigness they never formerly attained, and then
it was commonly the Work of six or seven days.

4. The Pain was vehement, so that for three Days and Nights I had scarcely any
intermissions of Ease, but a continual Crying and Roaring out. Several
Physicians and Chyrurgians were with Me, but their Counsels availed nothing as
to the giving me Ease, although many of them were put in Execution, and might
be probably enough expedients in other Cases: at last I conceived, That by
reason of the magnitude of the Tumor, its black color, and extravasation of the
Blood, that if the Blood was not taken away suddenly, that the Tumor might be
diminished, a Gangreen must necessarily ensue: Moreover, the pain was so great,
that as a Fever was already excited with a Soreness of the Throat, so unless
ease was suddenly procured, nothing but a perfect Delirium, or Frenzy could be
forthwith expected.

5. In order to the doing of this, I caused one John Sare a Chyrurgian then
present with me, forthwith to apply Leeches to the part, which was done, and a
great deal of very pure Blood was drawn away, to the value, as he Judged, of
about nine or ten Ounces; so that the Tumor was apparently abated: After the
Leeches (which were many) had done Sucking; he fomented the said Piles for
about three hours, or more, with Linen Cloths dipped in hot Claret Wine, the
best and roughest that could be gotten; notwithstanding all this Bleeding and
fomenting, I had scarcely the least imaginable Ease, till about twelve hours
after, at what time I fell into a little Slumber or Sleep, which was the first
rest or sleep I met with from my first falling ill.

6. Ease thus happily Succeeding, together with a continual asswaging of the
Tumor, I caused the Piles to be anointed with Vnguentum Diapompholigos, and a
Cloth spread with the same to be applied to them; this gave me immediately more
and incredible ease: the anointing and application of fresh Ointment was
continued and renewed every three hours; in so much that the said Piles
speedily vanished, and in about eight or nine days time, they became perfectly
well, without the least imagination of their returning again to this Day. But
they left behind them a strong Lypiria, or Symptomatick continual putrid
Fever, together with a Tumor of the whole Collum, or Neck and Throat, both
external and internal, a hard binding up of the Bowels, and a vehement
Diaphoresis, or Sweating.

7. But some other Causes were thought Concomitant with the aforementioned
Conjunct Causes; for that in the progress of this Sickness even from the
beginning to the end thereof, it had almost infinite changes, forms, or shapes,
for which no natural Cause could be easily rendered: insomuch that it seemed to
be wholly supernatural: First, I was troubled with Convulsion fits, which
followed me for three Days and Nights with exceeding great Torture and Pain;
these being in appearance conquered, they left an exceeding weakness,
faintness, and pining; even to the day that this great Sickness fell upon Me,
which was three Weeks or thereabouts afterward. After which I fell ill of the
Piles, as aforesaid, of which in process of time becoming eased, I seemed as it
were to be well, but suddenly fell down again with greater amazement, pain and
weakness. It was ordinary for me to seem to Recover, and to be so well as if I
ailed nothing; at what time, and when freest from pain, I should be all of a
sudden taken Lame, sometimes in one Leg, sometimes in the other Leg, and
sometimes in both; at another time in the Hip, and so in other parts, so that I
could neither go nor stand: Nay, nor without very great pain stir my Self
either in my Chair or Bed; nothing to be seen all this while either of Tumor,
discoloring, or any other hurt upon the part, or any place near it; nor any
hurt yet done to the same by any external violence preceding it; and this to
last two or three days, and then to go away of its own accord. Upon the
appearance of these, such Medicaments as was thought most proper, not only by
my self, but also by many other very able and learned Physicians, were applied,
but without the least appearance of any Good; yea rather the Symptoms were
exasperated, in so much that we were forced to give over the most hopeful
expedients. If upon the taking of any probable Medicine, and that of a high
Nature, and admirable preparation, I found any good, or ease, it was but for
four or five times taking, and then without any new Cause known either to Me,
or my assistants, I presently Relapsed, and became (if possible) ten times
worse than I was before. Of these Relapses I had many, during all which I had a
mighty Tumor of the whole Collum, both external and internal, so that I could
neither turn my Neck on any side, nor swallow the least thing without very
great difficulty and pain, and for the most part in danger of Suffocation. When
at any time the Vehemence of the Symptoms slacked; I began again to Swallow
freely and well, as if I had never ailed any thing, which hopeful condition
would last sometimes, ten, twelve, or fourteen days upon Me, every day growing
better: At length, and all of a sudden without any apparent praevious Cause,
yea in about two hours time, I should again fall into a Relapse so great, as
that not only my Self, but the Bystanders could not believe that I could ever
recover it; for that there would be present a great Sickness at Heart,
sometimes Vomiting, sometimes not, with an Oppression of the Stomach, and
Stoppage of Breath even to Swooning away: after the Vehemence of the Symptom
was over, there then remained the old difficulty of Swallowing with Vehemence
of pain; and sometimes I could not Swallow at all, but as things were thrust
down by force: Not so much as a Raison could I get down by Virtue of the
Faculty of the part, might I have had the whole World as a Reward for so doing.
And in this state I should continue sometimes six, eight, twelve, or fourteen
days, and then again find a little amendment. After this manner I spent
eighteen Weeks, at the end of which time my Body became a mear Skeleton,
covered only with Skin. From hence, I grew worse and worse, and dispa^ring of
Life, resolved in my own Breast to go into the Country, (not out of hopes of
Life but only to Dye) that thereby I might for a few days seclude my self from
my affairs, from Visitants, and indeed as much as might be from the whole
World, before I went hence, to that place, from whence (as Job says) I shall
never more return. I went into the Country not above five or six miles from
London, and in about eight or ten days time or thereabouts, without taking of
any Physic (except the Pill of my Laudanum, which I had ordinarily taken
before, every Night, for fifteen or sixteen Weeks time in London, I became, to
all apprehensions perfectly well; so that about New years day, I was not only
freed from all my pains, swallowed well, eat, drank, and slept well; but also
my so extremely extenuated Body, became filled with flesh again. Seeing my Self
in so good a Condition, I suddenly returned to the City, where after a few
days, by little and little, (almost insensibly) my Disease returned, and I fell
into another Relapse; of which I shall speak in the sequel of this Observation.

8. But leaving the abstruse or hidden Causes of these things to the various
determinations of other Judgments, we shall now come to show what Medical
Progress was made in order to the Cure of this supposed more than natural
Disease. The Piles being perfectly removed, as aforesaid at 6. above, left
behind them a continual Fever, a Tumor of the whole Collum, both external and
internal, a Vehement Diaphoresis, or Sweating, with a Costiveness, or hard
binding up of the Bowels for about ten days. I conceived it highly necessary to
move the Belly, for which cause I ordered emollient Clysters to be exhibited,
Morning and Night: Take Milk a pint, Honey, Oil Olive, of each four spoonfuls:
mix, and give it warm. These went not without their Success, for they brought
away a vast quantity of hardened Excrements: I continued them for five or six
days, but no longer than I took Clysters, no longer could I go to Stool.

9. Upon this I considered with my Self, what was fit farther to be done; and I
ordered a Decoction of Damask Roses in Clarified Whey. I drank liberally of it,
that it gave me not so much as one Stool, but I grew harder bound in Body than
before. Hereupon I repeated over Night the former Clyster, and the next Morning
the same again: but before the Clyster was given in the Morning, I took the
following Purge: Take Carraway and Fennel seeds, of each a dram: Sena, half an
ounce: White Wine, a pint and half; boil to a pint, strain, and sweeten with
white Sugar: This I drank almost quite off: It moved my Body well, and purged
Me for at least three or four days, bringing away at first a great plenty of
Water, then much cold, moist, thick, slimy, and viscous matter, so that I was
apparently eased thereby, the Fever and Sweating somewhat abated.

10. But the looseness occasioned by taking the aforesaid Dose of Sena, (which
was all the Purges I had taken for more than twenty years last past) continuing
long upon Me, and I finding in twelve or fourteen days time no Release
therefrom: I began to think of something for that purpose. However, in the mean
season, the Fever returned again with its Violence, which was such, that there
was no real Intermission, but only a small Remission or slacking of the heat,
for sometime; during these kinds of Remissions, there was a plentiful
Diaphoresis, which I thought was Critical at first, but it proved much
otherwise, viz. Symptomatical of a begun Tabes or Pining, wherein the flesh of
the whole Body wasted from Head to Foot: and of the like Quality was the
Diarrhoea or Looseness before spoken of, which indeed was nothing more nor less
but a real Colliquation, or melting of all the humors and juyces of the whole
Body; but during the time that this Diarrhoea and vehement Ephidrosis
continued, the Catarrh was much abated though not quite taken away.

11. But it was the Diarrhoea (next to the Tumor in the Collum) which most
afflicted Me: the Tumor of the Collum was the most troublesome to Me; but the
Diarrhoea was the most dangerous, and therefore required my more immediate
consideration: for daily vast quantities of Water came from Me by Stool, and
that whether I eat or drank or no. This perpetual flux of the Water, caused a
dryness of the Ventricle, so that a want of Appetite, strait-way followed; yet
notwithstanding all this, I very seldom desired any Drink. And what Food I
received in at any time caused almost a perpetual heat and Burning in My
Stomach, and the Breath which came through My Nostrils, seemed to Me, not much
unlike the Mouth of a burning Furnace: However the Food would be at length
digested, but by the extreme heat, as I apprehended, of the Stomach, and its
vicious quality, it caused a Colloquation, or Liquifaction of the Food, rather
than a natural Digestion, for whatever I eat, all the Excrements of the Bowels
proved nothing but Water.

12. Upon this I weighed dilligently the State of My Body: I knew My self to be
Eusplanchnous, that is, one of Sound Bowels: I never had any Obstructions of
the Liver, nor had I any stoppage of the Lungs: the Gall performed its Duty
rightly, nor did I ever feel a disaffected Spleen, or Mesentery; nor had I ever
any Disease of the Intestines, save only, now and then upon the taking of cold,
a Simple Diarrhoea; as to the Heart, its Pulses were Indifferent strong and for
the most part equal, and the Animal Spirits strong and vigorous in their
Faculties. Hereupon I concluded to take a Dose or two of an Opiate, hoping it
might be some means to stay the Colloquation, and stopping the flux of the
Bowels; yet I doubted it would be pernicious to Me, as to the Ephidrosis.

13. I began with the Laudanum Opiatum at two grains and half, and found no
inconveniency in it: the next Night I took the same Dose; and the following
Night, the like: upon the fourth Night I took three grains thereof; upon the
fifth Night three grains and a half: upon the sixth Night four grains, which
Dose I took for a Week together: Upon the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteen
Nights I took four grains and a half: upon the sixteenth Night, and for
fourteen Nights together, I took five grains: upon the thirtieth Night and for
a Week together, I took five grains and a half: upon the thirty seventh Night,
and for fourteen Nights together I took a Dose of six grains. After this rate I
continued the taking of the Opiate, till I made the Dose fourteen grains and
more.

14. What I observed upon taking this Opiate My self, was quite contrary to all
whatsoever I observed in any of My Sick Patients: It stopped not the Diarrhaea in
the least measure; but the Looseness continued all along for complete ten Weeks:
in like manner did the Fever and the Diaphoresis, with the loss of Appetite:
But this is to be noted, that the said Diarrhoea, was not painful; and the
Stools (although almost all Water) at certain equal or set hours every day; the
working of the Bowels though never so great, and the Motions at Stool were
always easy, which I take to be the absolute effects of the Laudanum, although
it had not force enough so to alter the blood and habit of the body, as to stop
or hinder the Colliquation, or meltings of the Humor and Flesh. The
Diaphoresis continued much in the same posture; nor did it in my Apprehension,
(though contrary to my Expectation) in the least increase it. Yet this was
observable, that if I lay in My bed long beyond My usual hour, it would then
certainly increase the Ephidrotick Flood to a very great excess. All this
while, viz. during the said ten Weeks, although I had not the least stoppage of
Urine, or pain in making Water, yet I made but very little in quantity, for as
much, as it was almost all of it carried away by Stool.

15. I continued the taking of the said Laudanum, till I found My self
perfectly well, which was for more than three hundred days; during all which
time I was so far from finding an Inconveniency in that Medicine, that it
perpetually gave Me a vast relief, the which upon the pretermission of its use,
I became very sensible of. Nor did I find My self at all made more dull by the
same, but on the contrary can truly say, I was much more lively and cheerful
(my Condition considered) than I was in many other parts of My Life.

16. At the end of eight Weeks My Condition was exceeding low, accosted with a
strong Catarrh, vehement buurning Fever, great Looseness, large Sweating, and
want of Appetite, with a mighty Tumor of the whole Collum, both external and
internal, and a vast extenuated body, in such sort, that I became a perfect
Skeleton, or heap of bones, covered only with Skin, accompanied now with so
much weakness that I could not sit up in My Chair, or scarce move Me in My bed.
In the midst of all these hopeless Symptoms; I at last gave up My Self to
despair; and truly the Sentence of Death was passed upon Me in my own
particular, and, I had now resigned My self up into the Hands of My Maker, and
under the perfect Sense hereof I lay for some hours.

17. But after all this Resignation, that God might show Me how Great he was,
and the mightyness of his Power, as well as how Good, and the large extent of
his Love; He gave a Reprieve and Countermand, that My Soul should be Delivered
from Death, and My Life from the Power of the Grave. For between twelve and one
in the Morning (the same Night) I extremely Thirsted after a little Wormwood
Wine (a thing formerly affected by Me, though of late disused:) and My desire
was so extreme, that My Life (at that Moment seemed to depend thereupon. It was
gotten for Me, though at so unseasonable a time; and I drank a quarter of a
pint of it: it satisfied Me much, (excepting as to its quantity, for I thought
I could have drank a Gallon or two thereof) and revived me above the Power or
Force of the greatest Cordial. Presently after I found I had a Stomach, and
desired to eat somewhat, I did not much care what; I was answered that there
was Mutton in the House, and I caused two little Stakes to be broiled for me
upon the Coals, which was done, and I eat it up, and I drank after the same a
draught of Ale; and then reposed my Self to Rest: This was more than I had done
before from the beginning of My Sickness; and this continued for some days: I
drank daily the Wormwood Wine, a quarter of a pint, or half a pint a day; and
my Appetite continued and I eat and drank freely and slept well, and had in my
own Soul again the Assurance of Recovery.

18. Upon the Consideration and Experience of these things, My Heart rejoiced
in God My Savior; and my Soul gave Thanks unto him, for his numberless
Mercies, Saying,

O God, who art the God of Truth and Faithfullness, the Preserver of the Just,
and of all that put their Trust in Thee.

Thou art the strong God, a Refuge for the Afflicted, the God of Health and
Salvation, and My Fathers God: I know Thee, therefore My Soul shall Trust in
Thee for Ever.

I have taken Thy Name upon Me, I bear the Character of Thine Holiness, and the
Seal of Thy Forgiveness, so that I cannot but Acknowledge Thee.

I have proved Thy Loving Kindnesses of Old; I have seen the Goings forth of
Thy Salvation in former times, therefore shall not My Soul despair.

But Thou, O God of Mercies, have renewed the Seal of Thy Covenants; Thou have
given to My Soul fresh assurances.

Of late, even but Yester-day, when Pangs did Surround Me, when the Anguish of
Death did take hold of Me; even then I cried unto Thee, and thou heardst Me.

When I said surely I shall Dye, My Torment is greater than I can bear; yet
then secretly did Thy Right Hand sustain Me.

I poured forth My Complaints unto Thee, and Cried unto Thee the Deliverer;
Thou sent forth Thy Saving Health in an acceptable time.

For I certainly knew, that Thou would hear Me, and therefore My Soul put its
Confidence and its Trust wholly in Thee, O My Lord and My God.

For this Cause, My Soul shall exult in Thy Goodness, and make its boast of Thy
Mercies; nor so long as I have Breath, will I cease to give Praise to Thy Holy
Name.

But surely Thou still provest those whom Thou Love, Thou still Tryest them;
Thou Visitest Thy Children with Afflictions, to see how They will Receive it
from Thine Hand.

To see whether they can accept of it as Their Daily Bread, and be as well
pleased therewith as with Treasures.

But Thou, O My God, have Taught Me; Thou have Instructed My Soul in
Afflictions, Thou have Taught Me to draw the more nigh to Thee in the day of
Distress.

What shall I give to Thee, O Lord, for all Thy Mercies for all Thy Secret
Love, and for Thine innumerable Favors toward Me?

I will offer up a Heart wholly Devoted to Thy Love; a Soul Burning in the
Flames of Thine Zeal, a Body only destinated to Thy Service.

I will consecrate My whole Self an Oblation upon Thine Altar, that I may be a
Sacrifice of sweet Savor, and become Thine entirely for Ever.

Now My Soul knows that in Thee only is Life and Health; because Thou, O Lord,
art that Eternal Fountain, from which all the Streams thereof Flow.

Thou art the Fountain of all Mercies and Goodness, of all Loving Kindnesses
and Forgiveness: with Thee (O health of My Soul) there are yet innumerable
Mercies reserved in store.

Wherefore then should I fear? Or, Why should Thy Servant doubt? Why should
Terrors Affright Me? Or Pangs make Me to Despair?

When I consider Thy Faithfullness through all Generations; Thy Tender Mercies
in Ancient times, and Thy outgoings of Old; My Soul is bowed down before Thee.

How the Angel of Thy Presence, accompanied the Children of Thy Love, and Thy
Mighty Power went before them.

How Thou broughtst them out of the Iron Furnace, and Redeemed them from the
Power of the Children of Oppression! and said unto them, fear not, serve Me.

Yet after all this, They Dissobeying Thy Voice, and with innumerable
Rebellious, provoking Thee; Thou still stretched forth Thine Hand to have Mercy
upon them.

Surely, Thou art a God that changest not; I know that time cannot alter Thee;
therefore will I forever put My Trust in Thee.

O all ye Powers of My Soul, Trust in the Lord, and Fear not, but Praise and
Magnify his Great and Holy Name for Ever and Ever. Amen.

19. But to proceed, after this beginning of Amendment; My desire was
insatiable after the Wormwood Wine, of which I notwithstanding drank but a
small proportion every day, by which I felt My Stomach continually bettered:
However I was very Cautious of taking it too Liberally, or any way to satiate
My Appetite after it; for that I feared if I began once to loath that which was
the daily cause of My Appetite, if My Appetite should afterward fail, that I
should be then left without Remedy. I continued long in this hopes of
Amendment; but for about fourteen days, it was very apparent.

20. At the end of about ten Weeks, My Fever and Diarrhoea left Me at once,
after which the Catarrh, Tumor of the whole Collum, and continual Sweating
increased prodigiously; by means of which My Appetite again decayed, and My
already extenuated Body wasted more and more every day, till my Condition
became very deplorable in the Eyes of all that saw Me; The Catarrh now became
more troublesome, and because that long evacuation by Stool was now of its own
accord stopped, without doubt the Watery humor partly was exhausted by the Mouth,
and partly by Sweating, and part of it fell upon the fleshy parts of the
Collum, thereby causing a most extreme Swelling of all the parts thereof.

21. In order to the taking away of the Catarrh, I thought of two things; the
one was to Shave My Head, and to apply thereto a Cephalic Emplaster with some
powerful drawing things: The other was, That because I had for some Weeks taken
Laudanum without Inconveniency to make some considerable Increase of its Dose,
upon this special occasion. These things were accordingly done; and by the same
I received very much benefit; for though the Catarrh was not wholly taken away,
yet I felt not that perpetual tickling of Rhume as before, nor was I troubled
with much Spitting: also hereby, I rested exceeding well. But as I found good
one way, I found evil another, for the Tumor of the Collum waxed greater and
greater, and the Diaphoresis was apparently enlarged, which, in the Eyes of
some Physicians present, was an incurable Symptom.

22. In the mean season I was not unmindful of the other Symptoms: Outwardly
the Neck was extremely swelled, so that the Head could not be turned on either
side without extreme pain; for this, I caused it to be well bathed with the
Powers of Amber, Morning and Night, and kept it warm with a Flannel five or six
times double, this gave Me sensible ease. The internal parts which were
Tumified were the Amygdalae, the Pharynx and Larynx: The Amygdalae were swollen
to a prodigious bigness, and began to Wax hard, being a little out of their
proper Seats. In order to their reduction, I first for a day or two received
the Fumes of Pepper out of a Bottle upon the parts afflicted, after this
manner: Take Milk, a quart: Pepper in Powder an ounce; boil them together for a
quarter of an hour, then put all together into a Stone Bottle, out of the Mouth
of which, let the Fumes be received into the Throat. This was repeated four or
five times, at once as hot as could be endured, and done Morning and Night for
two days together; at every time doing thus, viz. Morning and Night, etc. there
came above half a pint or more of a cold viscous or slimy Water, by which I had
much relief, and could now swallow a little: but to perfect the Reduction of
the Amygdalae, I caused a Woman with her Fingers to force them into their
proper places, besmearing them with the Common Confect of Alkermes mixed with
the Compound Powder of Crabs-claws, to an ounce of the first a quarter of an
ounce of the last: This done, I could now immediately Swallow without the least
pain or seeming stoppage.

23. The Pharynx and Larynx were also vehemently tumified; and by reason of the
continual flux of Humors, a rawness happened to the same, with Ulcers which
were exceeding painful. Many things were used, as first Diamoron; after that a
Solution of Alum and Honey in Limewater: Then a Preparation of white Vitriol:
after that a Solution of Saccharum Saturni, in a weak Vitriol Water, with many
other things of like Nature, the least of which were sufficient to cleanse and
heal any ordinary Ulcer, yet they did Me no good at all: but the reason was,
the first cause was not removed, but continually assaulted the part afflicted,
by which means the Ulcer was continued, or else renewed: And this thing is
clear, for when, the Catarrh was stopped, and the Flux of Humors removed, these
Ulcers healed of themselves, without the application of any Remedy.

24. As to the Diaphoresis or excessive Sweating, I took Oils of Sulphur and
Salt, as also Oil of Vitriol, sometimes the one, sometimes the other, the use
of which I continued for five Weeks: I took six, eight, and sometimes ten drops
or more at a time in the Liquor which I drank, whether Beer, Ale, or Wine; nor
indeed did I take any Drink without some drops of those acids for full five
Weeks together; by which My Inclination to Sweating was very much abated: now
whereas this Ephidrotick Flood came upon Me at certain hours, which was while I
was in My Bed, and toward Morning, that I might the more resist it, I commonly
arose, and was made ready, by which also in part, the vehemence of the
Diaphoresis was removed; so that with partly taking those acid Oils, and partly
by early rising, preventing the first access, the said violent or dangerous
Sweating was totally abolished, in about five Weeks time.

25. To restore and comfort the Appetite, and help the concoctive and digestive
Faculties, as I was of opinion, that a great deal of cold, viscous Phlegm lodged
in the Ventricle or Stomach, was the Cause of those hurts; so I thought a
gentle Vomit which would educe Phlegm, might much conduce to the removing not
only of the Cause of those Evils, but also of many other Symptoms now
Predominant according to the Nature of My Disease. My present weakness forbad
Me the taking of a strong Vomit, least I should be overcome in the Operation,
(as some others have been) after little Consideration, I conclude upon the salt
of Vitriol, of which I took a dram, in Broth. It brought away a great quantity
of Phlegm, after which I found My Self much the better: the next day I repeated
the Dose, and so gave over. Now that I might comfort the Ventricle thus weakened
by that quantity of Pituitous matter, so long lodged there, as also in some
measure hurt by the Operation of the Vomit, I took for a Month (having it ready
prepared) the Stomatick Tincture following: Take spirit of Wine, rectified and
very strongly repleat with the Volatile Salt of Tartar six ounces: the lesser
Cardamoms, four drams: Pepper, three drams: Cloves, two drams: Cubebs,
Anacardiums, of each one dram: all in fine Powder, digest till the spirit of
Wine is very red, which will be in about 20 days, after decant the clear
Tincture, and add thereto Chemical Oils of Rosemary, of Sage, of Oranges, of
Limons, and of Cloves, of each twelve drops, shake all well together, and keep
it for use. Of this I took by turns thirty or forty drops in a Glass of Ale or
Wine, thrice or four times a day; and sometimes I took it in Milk, and in Broth.

26. To prevent the farther Progress of the Tabes, or Consumption and present
pining, and to restore My weak extenuated Body and wasted Flesh, I betook My
Self to Broths made strong with the Gravey and Juice of Meats (not made of
Sinews and Knuckles) whether Fowls, Mutton, or Beef; and likewise to Red-Cows
Milk, of which I drank largely: The Broth was made of the lean of good fat
Fowls, or Buttocks of Beef, and Legs of the same; and Legs of Mutton, freed
from Skin, Fat and Sinews, and boiled in a proportionate quantity of Water,
till the Broth was very strong, and the goodness wholly out of the Meat: This I
took instead of Food, and the Milk instead of Drink, of which I drank very
largely, and so continued the same for five or six Weeks or more, being all the
refection which I received, and the things only which (through the Blessings of
God) were the Supporters of My Life. Now of the various Broths this I have to
say, That though I think that the several kinds were all profitable to the same
end, yet that made of Beef was not only the most Pallatable, but truly much
more Nourishing, than those which were made either of Fouls, or of Mutton, as
My own daily experience can Witness.

27. As for the more solid Food it was Raisons of the sun, and choice Almonds,
which I now and then, or, as I could get them down eat of; and this I did
indeed for many Weeks together, by which I had some refection, and My Life was
continued in Pain: After this manner continuing eighteen Weeks, I was reduced
to scarcely any thing else than Skin and Bone: My Distemper manifestly
increased upon Me, to such an extremity, that Life was dispaired of, not only
by all that came to Visit Me, but I began to be without hope in my own Breast
also.

28. Under the Sense of all these Disconsolations, to ease My Self of Visitants
and Business, (and to Exercise My Meditations also upon the more excellent
things.) I retired for some time into the Country, under a Serene and sharp
Air, as aforementioned, where I only took My usual Pill of Laudanum; the first
Night of My lodging in the Country was desperate, so that those that were with
Me no longer expected Life: yet it pleased God so to Bless Me under those
Circumstances, that I presently amended, and My Body began to be repleat with
Flesh, even to a Miracle; for in about eight days time, I was to all appearance
almost perfectly well, and in less than fourteen days, not only the hopes, but
the Evidence of My Recovery was indubitable; whereupon I forthwith returned to
London again.

29. After My return to London, in less than three Weeks time I Relapsed, and
My Distemper a fresh assaulted Me, so that by Degrees I declined, and in a very
short time was reduced to the old condition, and state if not worse I was taken
again with the difficulty of swallowing, and a soreness of the Throat, so that
I could have no rest Day, nor Night: My Body pined and languished away, so that
I became the Spectacle or Wonder of Mankind: I was also of a sudden and unawars
taken with Lameness again, sometimes in one Leg, which would be after two or
three Weeks well; and then all of a sudden on the other Leg, so as that I could
neither go nor stand, no previous cause going before; and sometimes with
Lameness in My Arms and Hands, so that I was forced to keep My Bed for six
Weeks together, and all this with great Pain, loss of Appetite, sickness at
Stomach, a profuse Catarrh, Soreness of the Mouth and Throat, and a Tumor of
the whole Collum.

30. I began now to consult de novo, what I should do. I gave over the taking
for a Night or two My Laudanum, but with so sensible and great a Detriment to
Me, that I could not repair it in many days after. Wherefore in the first
place, I reassumed the same with a Resolution, never to give over the taking
thereof, till there was a Determination of My Disease in Death or Life. And
truly this I must confess, That the benefit which I found by that Medicament
(as by Me prepared, and specially for My Own private use) is almost
unspeakable; it was the only thing (next to the Blessing of God) which
preserved My Life. And I am sensible had I not made use of it, or declined it,
after a little while using thereof, I had been long since in My Grave, unless
an Almighty Power had Miraculously sustained Me, and plucked Me out of the Jaws
of Death.

31. The continuation of the Laudanum, and augmentation of its Dose, as I saw
need required, was a good expedient against the Catarrh: I also swallowed
Morning and Night twenty grains of White Pepper split in half, and thirty
grains of choice Olibanum, by the use of which things and taking a weak
Limewater (fitted to My Pallat) as My Ordinary Drink, the Ventricle was
exceedingly Comforted; and the parts weakened with too much Humidities dried and
strengthened: However in the mean season I was not unmindful to strengthen and
fortify the Brain, and the Original of the Nerves, which I did do by the
constant taking three, four, or six times a day, a little of the following
Compositum: Take black Cherry-water, three ounces: Volatile Salts of Amber, of
Hartshorn, and of Man's skull, of each two drams: dissolve the Salts in the
Water, to which add of the strongest and purest Cinnamon Water dulcified, a
pint: syrup of Alkermes three ounces; spirit of Saffron, one ounce: Tincture of
Saffron and Cocheneel, made with rectified spirit of Wine, half an ounce: mix
them well together: by the continual use of these things alone the Catarrh was
perfectly Cured.

32. The External Tumor of the Collum, and the Lameness of the external parts
was removed by application of the following: Take Powers of Amber, six ounces:
Camphir one ounce, mix in little pieces and dissolve. With this, all the parts
swelled and pained, were Morning and Evening very well Bathed, and then wrapped
up very warm, and by the use thereof for two or three Weeks without weariness,
or giving over all those dis-affections became removed.

33. My Mouth was Sore beyond all Immagination of Expression, so that I could
Swallow no kind of thing solid, nor liquid without exceeding great pain, all
strong Liquors were dreadful to Me, yea if it were but a little Ale: and yet
all this while there was no Rawness or Ulcer, no Tumor or the lest appearance
of Inflammation, which makes the thing the more admirable: after many Weeks an
Exulceration appeared toward the beginning of the Pharynx: for which I took
this following Medicament: Take Liquorice in Powder, white sugar Candy in
Powder, of each two ounces: Juice of Limons enough to make a mass to be formed
into large Balls to be dried. These I held about the root of the Tongue, and
let them dissolve down My Throat at leisure, by which I found great ease, and
much good, moreover I eat daily the quantity of one Limon sliced with fine
Sugar; these things caused indeed the Sore and Exulcerated parts mightily to
Smart; which I endured for a Season, after a while the Smarting and Soreness
went away, and My Mouth, became perfectly Well, so that I could Swallow as well
as I could in all My Life; and this was completely performed by the two last
Simple Medicaments; which considering how great a Cure it was, and how extreme
and vehement My Pain and Misery, I could not, out of Thankfullness to God and
Love to his Creatures, but publish the same to the World; and that Man also
might see by what Simple means and weak Instruments sometimes he performs even
the greatest things.

34. The loss of Appetite and sickness of Stomach, I repaired by the Constant
taking of Wormwood wine; or a choice Canary made sufficiently bitter with the
Tincture of Wormwood: This Tincture was made only of Common Wormwood, two
ounces; put into a pint and almost half of Spirit of Wine rectified to the
highest, digested 20 days, and then strained out by Expression; into which the
same quantity of fresh Wormwood was again put, and digested as aforesaid, till
the Tincture became almost Blood red, the clear of which was decanted, into
another bottle for use. The Use of this took away the sickness at Stomach,
restored the lost Appetite, strengthened the concoctive Faculty, and took away
all manner of Nauseousness from Me: but now and then, for change-sake, I took a
little Spirit of Cinnamon well dulcified, by the use of which two things, My
hopes of a perfect Recovery were Daily strengthened.

35. But yet notwithstanding all these things were thus happily accomplished,
the Tabes, Atrophia or pining abated nothing; Though the Catarrh was Vanished,
^he Tumor of the Colum wholly abated; the Soreness of the Mouth and Throat taken
away and healed; the pains and Lameness of the whole Body removed; the Stomach
strengthened and fortified, so that I could digest my Food very well to my
thinking; and a good Appetite was begotten in me, together with a good
condition of the Bowels, and a total abolition of the Ephidrotick flood; yet
still for all these things, the pining remained, I wasted daily more and more
in my flesh; nor for all that which I eat, (and I fed plentifully, and digested
strongly) did I get the least strength, but grew daily weaker and weaker, so
that I could not go without one or two to lead me. Moreover, by accident I got
some cold, which gave me a violent Cough, from which particular Symptom, and
the Headache, I had been absolutely free during this whole Sickness.

36. I was very much concerned as to the Cough both in respect to its Violence
(as sometimes lasting 3, 4, or 5, hours upon me in an extreme manner) and in
respect to the parts; lest the sharp Rheum which came like a flood should
excoriate or Ulcerate the Tunicles of the Aspera Arteria or the Lungs, and
thereby create me more work to do, than I had before: for the remedy hereof, I
nearly doubled the dose of my Laudanum; and every night going to bed,
immediately after the taking of my Pill, I took the following draught: Take
the best Cinnamon water, four ounces: white Sugar two ounces or more; dissolve
the Sugar over a gentle heat till it comes to be like a Syrup. This quantity I
took at one time, and so went to rest upon it: also, in the morning fasting, I
took the half quantity thereof; and at any time of the day, if I perceived the
Cough to be coming I did the same.

37. By this means, almost as soon as I attempted the use of the Remedy, I had
ease and was freed from Coughing: if I took it at night going to bed, I was
perfectly free all that night from Coughing or Spitting; if I forgot it, or
took it not, the Cough would be so extreme, that my life became a Burden to
me, and by reason of the vehemence thereof, I should be Sore all the next day,
and at times spit Blood: but by the assiduous and constant taking hereof, I
fully mastred this pernicious and troubelsome Symptom. But this is observable
in this Medicine, that the quantity I took was almost as considerable as the
quality; for if I took but the half quantity at Night going Bed, although I was
delivered from the Cough in the fore part of the Night; yet I was sure to have
a fit thereof in the latter part of the Night before Morning; whereas, if I
took the full quantity of four ounces with the Sugar two ounces, I was sure not
to Cough that Night; and this I always took warm; and this very self same thing
I have since observed in several others of my Patients.

38. What was farther to be done, was only to put a stop to the pining, and to
recuperate if possible the Lost flesh: for this purpose I drank a gain for many
weeks of Red Cows milk, Morning and Evening, a quart at a time, warm from the
Cow, which sensibly did me much good; I also now and then took Conserves of Red
Roses: I continued the constant use of my Laudanum, with the grains of Olibanum
and White pepper; which I swallowed, as aforesaid, every Night imediately after
my Pill; and every Morning fasting, drinking the Milk after them (whilst I
continued drinking Milk) and at others times either a Glass of choice Canary,
or a Glass of pure clear Ale: But the grand Medicament which (under God) was
the means of perfecting my Restoration, was the constant use of my Electuarium
ad Tabidos, prepared as I have taught in my Doron Medicum lib. 2, cap. 22.
sect. 1. by the constant use of which (and the other things before named) I am
through the Divine Goodness and Mercy, at the writing hereof perfectly restored
to my pristin Health.

39. This proved a tedious disease to me, being as chargeable as it was extreme
and long; for it lasted upon Me a complete year. And one thing is observable
concering My Laudanum, which I prepare after a peculiar manner, and with Salt
of Egg-shells: I took it for full 300 Days without the least hurt or prejudice
imaginable; I am sure with an unspeakable and incredible good to me (for which
I humbly thank the Father of all Mercies.) When I took it at first, and for
some time, I was exceeding heavy, dull and drowsy, provoking Me also in some
measure to Sweat; and the next day somewhat illish at Stomach, so that I could
not stir till about Noon. After I had continued the use of it for some pretty
while; its Operation upon My Body was clear another thing, for it made Me the
following day, pleasant, cheerful, lightsom, merry, and wakeful, so that I
could rise, and constantly did (at those times I kept not My Bed) at four a
Clock in the Morning for several Months together: and after a long taking of
it, it brought Me to that pass, that if I had no Stomach, nor any mind to eat,
although the most delicate thing which could be thought on; yet within half a
quarter of an hour after taking of it, that I could eat any thing even the
coursest Food, and that with a great deal of Savoryness, Content and
Satisfaction, which thing I observed, not for once only, but I believe for more
than an hundred times; so that many times when I had resolved to go to Bed
without My Supper for want of a Stomach, presently after the taking of My Pill
of Laudanum, I was forced to order a Supper to be got ready for Me; and
sometimes My Appetite would be so sharp, that I could not wait the getting of it
ready, but was forced to eat what came first to hand, till other things were
prepared. Also when I took it in the largest quantity, it provoked Urine so
excessively, that it would constantly force Me to make more Water by much, than
I drank Liquor of all sorts, in so much that many times I was forced to
diminish the Dose for that very Reason sake; and commonly every Night it
brought from Me near a dram of hard but small and almost Blood red Gravel,
which I looked upon to be a thing of very good Consequence. I have given the
same to another Man for the Stone; he took it for near a year, he told Me, It
cured him when all other Medicines failed him, and after he had spent (as he
said) above two thousand pounds on that Cure in Vain: He took it without the
least injury to him, and by his Relation, it had much the same operation upon
him, which it had upon Me; from all which things I am made to believe, that
most Physicians have been extremely deceived about the nature and use of
Opiates.

40. What now remains! but that I (a Miracle amongst the Living) should offer
up to My Compassionate Redeemer, My Lord and My God, in a Song of Redemption
and Salvation, even perpetual Praises and Thanksgiving, from an humble Spirit
and contrite Heart, filled with Reverence and Fear.

Give Thanks, O My Soul unto the Lord, for He is good, a God of Faithfullness
and Truth, his Loving Kindnesses, and his Mercies endure for Ever.

Give Thanks unto his Name, Sing aloud his Everlasting Praises, Declare his
Loving Kindnesses to the People; his Mighty and his Glorious Acts.

Thou beholdest, O Lord, the Poor, Thou have respect to the Distressed, Thou
speak Comfortably to the Children of Affliction; saying,

I am the Almighty God, Strength and Salvation wait upon Me; I am the
Invincible and the Holy One, Conquest and Victory attend Me.

I appear in Lightning, and speak in Thunder; I Cloth My Self with Majesty and
Glory: I dwell in the highest Heavens; and make My Habitation in the
inscrutable Depths.

I converse with the humble in Spirit, and the contrite in Heart: the Angel of
Peace prepares My way before Me.

Then I stretch forth My Arm of Salvation, My Consolations are with Me; and I
reveal to the Sons of Men My Saving Health.

I say, Return ye Children of Folly, and I will heal You: I will change your
Waters of Bitterness: and give you for them, the Well springs of an Immortal
Life.

Thus, O God of all Mercies, Thou Tryest and Provest Us; Thou stretchest out
Thine Hand all the Day long; Thou Blessest the Afflicted with good Things.

When I think of Thy Goodness, I am astonished: when I call to Mind Thy Tender
Mercies, and Thy Compassions that fail not; I am confounded within My Self;
saying,

What is Man, that Thou carest thus for him? and what is the Son of Man, that
Thou art thus Mindful of him?

What am I, that Thou should thus look upon Me? Or My Fathers House, that Thy
Compassions should thus perpetually attend Me?

Ah! surely I am Thy Servant, the Work of Thine own Hands; the thing that Thy
Power has formed: Thou have made My Soul to delight in Thy Love for Ever.

Yet how apt are We to go astray? How easily does the Tempter prevail? How easy
is it for Man to be deceived by glorious Appearances? how often is he taken in
the Snare?

I had been deceived, and almost caught in the Net; but Thy Right Hand has
delivered Me: I have been on the brink of the Precipice, I have been ready to
fall; yet then did Thy Righteous Power sustain Me: Thou, O Lord, have preserved
Me from the Snare of the Hunter.

Thou did suffer Me to prove My strength; Thou have showed Me My Weakness,
and what I am without Thee, the supporter of the Ends of the Earth.

Then Thou layest Afflictions upon Me, Thou Correctest Me according to Thy good
Pleasure; Thou suffer the Mouth of Slander to Wound Me, and the Lying Tongue
to oppress Me; even the Lying Mouth, and the Perjured Tongue of Infamy.

Thou did suffer the Envious Spirits to Rage, and the Lying Spirit to Grieve
Me: Maliciously They laid things to My Charge that I knew nothing of.

Then also, O God, did Thou with draw Thy Self a little from Me; Then did
Thou Cloud My Glory: Surely, said I, I shall lie under the Reproach of Villainy,
under the secret lashes of Lying and Deceitful Tongue, without Redemption for
Ever.

But mine Innocence stood up for Me: And My Afflictions stood in the Gap, even
the Rod of God, so that in the midst of all My Sorrows, it became My staff and
My stay.

Thus, once more, Thou broughtst Me down to the Borders of Death; and the Grave
opened its Mouth, as ready to receive Me: Then again made I My Supplication
unto Thee.

Thou heardest again the Cry of Thy Servant; and the Moanings of My Afflicted
Soul: and although the Mountains traveled; yet it was Thy Arm only, O Lord,
that brought Salvation unto Me, in Thy Word only did I find saving Health.

I saw now, that it was good for Me, that Thou did still Try Me; it was good
for Me, that I had been thus afflicted; that for a little season Thou should
hide Thy Face from Me.

Yet secretly did Thou make Me to partake of Thy Mercies: and in the midst of
all Disconsolations, Thou made My Soul to Drink overflowing Cups of Thy
Loving Kindnesses.

And although, Thou, O My God, did obscure Thy Self; and although Thou did
Cloud Thy great Glory, and did withold Thy Presence for a little Season,
whereby Thy Afflicted Servant was troubled:

Yet now I know, it was according to Thy Wisdom and Thy Righteousness, by which
Thou Governest ALL things: I know now, that Thou did not intend to hide Thy
Self from Me for Ever.

Return Thou unto the Wicked according to their Wickedness: let the Slandering
and the Lying Tongue Perish; and who so devises false things against their
Neighbor.

But have Thou respect unto Thy Servant, remember his integrity of Heart: O
guide Me in the way of Peace; and lead My Feet in the Way Everlasting, for
Jesus sake. Amen.

So shall I, as long as I Live, Remember Thee, O My God; whilst I Breath, I
will speak of Thy Praise: Let My Soul never forget Thy manifold Mercies toward
Me; Nor My Tongue cease to declare Thine innumerable Loving Kindnesses.

Thou do whatsoever Thou Please: Thou will Preserve the Just; the
Righteous shall dwell in Thy Presence for Ever.

Fulfill Thou the desire of Thy Servant; hear Thou My Voice, and save Me: let My
Mouth speak Thy Praise.

My Heart rejoices in Thy Salvation; and all the Powers of My Soul shall Bless
and Magnify Thy Holy and Glorious Name; to whom belongs Majesty, Dread, and
Dominion, henceforth and for Ever. Amen.

II. A Catarrh with a suffocation of the Lungs.

1. A Man of fifty years of Age, in the beginning of Winter had a vehement
Catarrh fell upon him, together with a great Obstruction of the Lungs, so that
he could not well lie down on his Back at Night, he was of a cold, moist and
phlegmatic Constitution, Corpulent and Fat.

2. Being as it was thought at the point of Death, he sent for several learned
Men, they Prescribed to him six weeks or more, but all in vain; insomuch as now
the Sick was wholly given over; I was desired by some of his Relations to render
him a Visit, and whetrhe Live or Die to Administer somewhat to him.

3. When I first saw him I Judged his Condion to be very desperate, and was
loath to Interpose my self in so unlikely an Affair; however I was prevailed
upon, and I Prescribed him the following things.

4. Now as the Obstructions of the Lungs, which put him in perpetual danger of
suffocation was the most dangerous Symptom, so I thought good to begin with
that first; For which I Exhibited these things: Take choice Canary, a quart;
Tincture of spanish Juice of Liquorice, made with Canary, half a pint; Oil of
Tartar per deliquium, six ounces: mix them, and let the sick take 2 spoonful
thereof either alone, or in Ale; which he repeated four, five, or six times a
day.

5. Moreover he had a Cough withal, for which I ordered him to take a
spoonful or two of it, when the fit of Coughing came upon him; by the use of
this alone Medicament, his Cough was taken away, and the Obstruction of the
Lungs to all appearance perfectly removed.

6. However I ordered the same quantity again to be repeated, to which I added
syrup of Meconium, one pound, which he took in all respects as the former, by
the taking of which last; We did not only confirm and secure to us the
healthful Disposition of the Lungs, but the Catarrh was also in some Measure
mended thereby; the next Intention is to remove the Catarrh; for which I
ordered an ordinary Decoction to be made with Guajacum, Sarsa, Liquorice, and
the Carminatitve seeds, which he was to take as his daily Drink.

7. In the next place I gently Purged him with this following Liquor: Take
White Wind, a pint: Sena, two ounces: Ginger; a dram: Cream of Tartar, two
drams; digest all Night, or, if you will, a Day and a Night in a sand heat,
then strain it, sweeten with a little white Sugar, and keep it for use: This he
took about three ounces at a time in the Morning fasting; and it did purge him
notably, I Caused him to repeat it every five or six Days, for four times.

8. In the Intermediate Days of Purging and also for sometime after the Purging
was over, I caused him at Night to take a little Pill of the following
Composition: Take Thebian Opium, extracted with the spirit of Wine, and
Inspissated to a thickness, to make Pills thereof, one ounce: Venice Treacle,
five drams: Liquid storax, two drams; Chemical Oil of Wormwood, one dram: mix
them all well together, and with Ginger, in fine powder, a sufficient quantity;
make up a mass of Pills.

9. The Dose is three grains, which may be Continued, augmenting half a grain
every third or fourth Day, for thirty, forty, or sixty Days, as necessity shall
require; with the continual taking of this Medicine, for two or three Months,
the sick was perfectly Recovered and Restored to his former Health.

LONDON, Printed for Th. Dawks, and L. Curtiss.

The Chapter of the Catarrh continued. Numb. 33.

III. A Catarrh with a great Obstruction of the Lungs, in a Young Married
Woman, accompanied with a deep Consumption.

1. The Person thus afflicted was about twenty eight years of Age, and for
eleven years past, had been in some measure troubled with these Griefs; the
habit of her Body, by what I could gather when she was formerly in Health, was
Sanguine; but by reason of the long continuance of her Disease, she became of a
cold and moist Temperature, so that she seemed to be wholly made up of Phlegm;
for she spit a vast quantity of frothy pituitous matter.

2. Her Body became so emaciated and wasted, that she seemed to be a very
Skeleton; her Lungs was so obstructed and stopped, and the difficulty of
Breathing so great, that for more than ten years she could not lie along in her
Bed upon her Back.

3. Nor when I came to her, could she in the least express her Self by Words,
and her Breath so short as if she had been Breathing her last; in so much, as
that I could scarcely believe, she could Live two or three hours to an End; and
the Bystanders feared she would not Live till the next Morning.

4. The Cause of this Disease was originally a fierce Catarrh, which followed
her (more or less) for ten or eleven years, as aforesaid, as it was related to
Me; whence came her thin and Consumptive Body, and the evil Disposition of the
Lungs, aforementioned.

5. She declined by degrees, but for many years, as was said before, could not
lie along in her Bed: however the two last years were remarkable, for the
height of her indisposition, and the two last months before I took her in hand,
the Distemper seemed as if it had arrived to its Extremity; so that now she
must have Remedy, or inevitably Perish.

6. Many things all along were used to Restore this wretched Creature, but all
in vain; and by Relation it cost her Husband some hundreds of pounds, but to
the great dis-advantage of this miserable Soul, for instead of being benefitted
by what was administered to her, she became very much worse.

7. In order to this Cure, there are three principal Intentions: the first, to
open the great and mighty Obstructions of the Lungs, without which Death would
speedily take Possession: the second, is to take away the Conjunct Cause of the
Disease: thirdly, to fortify and strengthen the weakened parts, that for the
future they might rightly perform their Functions; whereby also the consumed
Carcass, might be repleat and filled again with Flesh.

8. The first Intention, which was opening the Obstructions of the Lungs, was
performed by these following Medicines: Take Canary, a pint: Tincture of the
Juice of Liquorice, three ounces: spirit of Sal Armoniack, forty drops: mix
them for a Pectoral; of this I ordered her to take a Spoonful every two hours
in a little Glass of Rhenish Wine sweetened with Sugar, and not to fail of the
constant taking of the same till it was gone.

9. In the Intermediate times between the taking of each Spoonful: I ordered
her often to take with a Liquorice stick, this following Syrup: Take Syrup of
the Juice of Citrons, four ounces: syrup of the Juice of Scurvy grass, two
ounces: syrup of Maidenhair, one ounce: Volatile Sal Armoniack, two drams:
dissolve it in half an ounce of Mint-water, and mix it with the former Syrups,
to be taken in the Intervals, as aforesaid.

10. She began to take of those Medicines about four a Clock in the Afternoon,
and by eight the next Morning, she fetched her Breath indifferent well, and
could a little use her Tongue; she still continued the use of these things, and
in about two days time more, she not only Breathed very freely, but also spoke
exceeding well; and in her own Opinion, as well as ever she did in her Life.

11. About a Week after, she could lie down all along in her Bed, which, by her
own Confesssion, was more than she had done for ten years before; for that the
Catarrh was so Vehement and Suffocative, that she could never attempt it
without danger of Choking.

12. I ordered her for her ordinary Drink, a Decoction of Guajacum, Sarsa,
Liquorice, Carminative Seeds, which I caused to be Sweetened for her daily
Drink; and withal that she should continue and repeat the use of the aforesaid
Medicines, for two or three months if occasion were.

13. After twelve days were over, I ordered her to take every Night, a Pill of
the Laudanum, described in the aforegoing Observation, and according to the
Method there directed.

14. And that she should every Morning fasting, for the Restoring, Comforting,
Strengthening, and Confirming the weakened parts of her Poor Consumptive Body,
take a dram, or two drams of our Electuarium ad Tabidos, and drink after it a
glass of choice Canary, for that mightily Restores, takes away Weaknesses, and
repleats a lean Body with Flesh.

15. During the time all those things were a performing, I caused her Head to
be anointed Morning and Night with Chemical Oil of Rosemary, one part mixed
with the Oil of Nutmegs by expression three parts.

16. Moreover her Stomach was to be anointed with Chemical Oil of Anniseeds,
one part mixed with the Oil of Nutmegs by expression two parts: and this also
to be done Morning and Evening, as the former.

17. Lastly, that the Soles of her Feet should be anointed with Oil of
Sassafras thrice a day, viz. Morning, Noon, and Night.

18. This Course being continued for six Weeks, she became perfectly well; nor
has she once Relapsed to this day, although it be above six years since.

19. All the Reward I had, was to say, I deserved nothing, that I was none of
the College, and therefore a Quack: For which Cause, If I would have any thing,
both She and her Husband bid Me take My Course at Law. I took their Counsel,
and was paid to the uttermost penny. Monstrum Horrendum! See the ingratitude of
some People.

IV. A Catarrh in a Woman Hysterical.

1. This Woman being about thirty five years of Age, had been two or three
years obnoxious to a Catarrh, which for the most part was accompanied with a
Cough, sometimes with Wheasing, Hoarsness, and Shortness of Breath.

2. Moreover she had been for many years troubled with Hysteric fits; the long
continuance of her Catarrh, brought her into a kind of Consumption; at last
there was an Atrophia or universal pining.

3. She sought to many for Help, but without success; she was extraordinarily
Purged and Vomited, had Blisters applied, the Seton, Issues, etc. but all
things proved unprofitable: in so much, That she was weary of taking any more
Physic.

4. Besides the former Courses she had plentifully used Chalybeats, and drunk
Mineral Waters, as of Tunbridge, Epsome, and Astroph-Wells, with great promises
of Cure by those means; but still with as ill Success as before.

5. At length she applied her Self to Me, and for My better Direction, gave Me
an account of all before Related: I wondered that all those things should make
no alteration in her; wherefore I conceived there was some greater Cause than
what those Physicians had Apprehended; and which lay yet undiscovered to all
that she hitherto conversed with.

6. The Woman seemed Melancholy, I told her, that I feared there was some
Discontents on her Spirits; which she Confessed to be true, but what it was, I
could never get her to declare.

7. However she perpetually declined in her Body, and at certain hours the Flux
of Rhume would be so great, that she would be in danger of Choking, whence a
vehement Cough would be forthwith excited, which lasted upon her half an hour
or more, by means of which she became inwardly Sore.

8. At other times upon the Motion of her Grief, and Discontent of Mind,
Hysteric fits would be excited in such a wonderful manner, that beholding her
once or twice in them, I stood amazed; for such was her exceeding strength
therein, that five or six men could scarcely hold her, although out of the fit,
a poor lean, weakly Woman.

9. The Aetiology thereof, we have not leisure to examine, although we doubt
not, but to the exertion of so great a strength, there must be a mighty Conflux
of Spirits of the Animal kind.

10. The Woman was not so much concerned for her Fits, for that they came but
now and then; but the Catarrh and Cough almost perpetually afflicted her, so
that unless that she had some speedy Relief, she concluded she could not hold
out much longer.

11. Her Body was in a good Condition, not Costive, nor very Loose, but that
which is most Remarkable of all was, That she made little or no Urine, scarce a
pint in two days, sometimes not a pint in three days, and yet she felt not in
those parts any kind of Obstruction, Heat, or Pain.

12. She desired me to Favor her with my best Advice, and to do the best for
her that lay in my Power, giving me a promise to be very grateful. After that I
had perceived her Urine to be so small in quantity, almost from the very
beginning of the Catarrh; I apprehended a transition of the Serous part of the
Blood to other parts of the Body, and that if so be, it could be reduced to its
right Current, there might be probably some hopes of Cure.

13. In the first place, I exhibited this following Clyster: Take Chicken
Broth, a pint: Oil of Camomil, three ounces: Confectio Hamech, one ounce:
Honey, three spoonfuls: dissolve them over a gentle heat; strain, and let it be
given warm.

14. After which being twice repeated: I gave her this following Syrup: Take
Juice of Parsley, three pints: Juice of Pellitory of the Wall, two quarts:
Honey, eight pound; boil all into a Syrup, of which I ordered her to take two
or three spoonfuls in the Morning fasting, half an hour before Dinner, and last
at Night going to Bed, and to continue the use thereof till such time as the
whole quantity was spent.

15. For her Drink, I ordered this: Take White Wine; six quarts: 18 large
Thomas Onions, sliced very thin: infuse them in the Wine; this Wine is to be
mixed with equal quantity of Water: at time of drinking, I prescribed for her
ordinary Drink.

16. By the use of these two things, the Course of the Serum was apparently
turned, and she began to make Water plentifully, her Catarrh was in some
measure abated, but not quite taken away, however, I ordered still the
Continuation of the same Medicament, with the Repetition of the same quantity,
but with a lessening of the Dose.

17. Now that the Cough, which did so vehemently afflict her, might be removed,
I ordered her the following Medicament: Take Tincture of spanish juice of
Liquorice, made in spirit of Wine, six ounces: Syrup of Meconium, eight ounces:
Syrup of Jujubes, two ounces: Oil of Sulphur per Campanum, so much as might
give it a pleasant Acidity, mix them; of this I ordered her to lick often
between Meals; but more especially, if she felt the Cough coming.

18. And whereas the Cough seized her for the most part with a greater
vehemence than ordinary, just at Bed time, or a little after she was lain down
to Sleep, I prescribed her the following: Take spirit of Wine, three ounces:
white Sugar so much as it will dissolve over a gentle heat, that it becomes
almost as thick as Syrup, this whole quantity to be taken just at lying down.

19. By the use of these things the Paroxysm of Coughing was constantly
prevented; and she slept quietly all Night, in so much, that after ten or
twelve days, her Cough wholly left her; and she also made Urine very
plentifully, her Catarrh likewise was very much abated, but yet she complained,
that at certain times it afflicted her, though not with that vehemence as
formerly to be in danger of Choking.

20. Her opinion was, That if she could be perfectly freed from her Catarrh,
she should be well, for which purpose I ordered her to take the Laudanum
Paracelsi every Night going to Bed, beginning first with two grains, and so
regularly increasing the Dose as we have formerly directed.

21. Next Morning she took Electuarium ad Tabidos which mightily confirmed not
only the healthful Tone of the Viscera, but also Restored her wasted Flesh, she
continued the use of these two last Medicines for about a quarter of a year, or
somewhat more; by which she became not only freed from her Catarrh and Cough,
but also perfectly Cured of her Hysteric fits; so that she was no more
troubled with them.

V. A Catarrh in an ancient Man, Joined with a kind of Paralytick Distemper.

1. This Man being about seventy years of Age, was assaulted with a very fierce
Catarrh, his Body was fat and gross, his Constitution Phlegmatic, and he had a
kind of a Resolution of the Nerves through his whole left-side, so that
although he had not lost the total use of his Limbs, yet they were so weak,
feeble and as it were benumed, that they stood him in but little stead.

2. I ordered him to purge once a Week with these following Pills: Take Pil. ex
duobus, two drams: Resin of Jallap, Mercurius dulcis, of each half a dram:
Elaterium, two grains: Oil of Lavender, twelve drops: make a mass: Dose about
twenty five grains: these Purged him admirably, and carried off the watery and
pituitous Humors.

3. His Drink I ordered to be, a decoction of Guajacum, sarsa, sarsafras and
the Carminative seeds in spring water.

4. In the Morning fasting half an hour before Dinner, and a little before
Supper; I ordered him the taking of the following Wine; Take choice Canary, a
gallon; Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs, of each two drams: Cubebs, Anacardiums, Zedoary,
Ginger, of each a dram: and a half: Cardamoms, grains of Paradise,
Juniper Berries dried, Cinnamon, of each a dram: Rosemary-flowers,
Lavender-flowers, Red sage dried, of each one ounce: Infuse all in the Wine
aforesaid close stopped; and after four Days it may be taken as before directed.

5. The Crown of his Head, I caused to Shaved and a Vesicatory to be applied
about the breadth of the palm of ones Hand, which was kept running for about a
Week, and after ten Days the Vesicatory was Repeated again.

6. Inwardly to comfort the Brain and strengthen the Animal Spirits; this
following Electuary was given: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, one ounce: Volatile
salt of Amber, half an ounce: salt of Hartshorn, choice Musk, of each two
drams: Ambergrise, half a dram: with syrup of Alkermes, a sufficient quantity,
make an Electuary.

7. Of this he took every Morning Fasting from a scruple to half a dram: and at
a Night going to Bed three or four grains of our Ladanum, the which he
continued for ten or twelve Weeks time.

8. Outwardly, he wore a Cucupha or Cap of Spices on his Head: and his whole
left-side, Arm and leg also, we bathed twice a Day with the Powers of Amber;
the use of which Medicines for a while perfectly Restored this our Aged patient.

9. Another Man something Inferior in Age to the former and much a like
afflicted with the same Distempers, was Cured by following Exactly the former
directions.

10. We also Cured another Man much alike afflicted by the same means.

11. We Cured also an Ancient Gentlewoman, having a like Catarrh and Paralytick
Distemper by the Method above prescribed.

12. Also we Cured the Daughter of the said Gentlewoman of a Numness or kind of
Paralysis, by the said method, giving her Exactly the same things.

VI. A Catarrh in a Butcher taken by Riding in the Cold.

1. A certain Butcher upon taking a very great Cold by Riding abroad in the
Rain, had a very great defluxion of Rhume by the Throat and Pallat, it was so
great that sometimes it Run out from his Mouth like a Tap, in the Daytime he
could scarce do any thing but spit, and in the Night time the Defluxions was so
great that he could not lie along in his Bed, for fear of Suffocation, but was
forced to sit upright, by which being in the Winter time, he accumulated to
himself more cold.

2. At length a great Hoarsness and vehement Cough seized upon him, with
Swellings of the Amygdalae, and Ulceration of the Throat, his Condition though
not dangerous, yet was very extreme, and required a speedy relief.

3. He sent for Me, and gave a Relation, as aforesaid; his Body being bound, I
first ordered an emollient Clyster, then I Purged him gently twice a Week with
Decoctum Senae Gereonis, by which he had many watery and viscous Stools.

4. The tumefied Amygdalae were reduced into their places by a Woman's Finger,
and they were twice or thrice Anointed with the following Balsam: Take Oil of
Nutmegs by expression, half an ounce: Liquid Storax, one dram: Honey, half a
dram: Pepper in fine Powder, two scruples; mix them well, and rub them over the
swelled Almonds.

5. To the ulcerated Throat, I applied this following Liquor: Take salt of
Vitriol, a scruple: Roman Vitriol, half a scruple: dissolve in a weak Lime
water, half a pint: sweeten it with juice of Liquorice and Honey, of each two
drams, and with this wash the Throat, by dipping a piece of Sponge therein
fixed fast to the end of a Probe, and so rubbing the ulcerated place therewith.

6. After it had been twice or thrice rubbed therewith, I caused him to Gargle
with this following Gargarism: Take spring Water, a pint: Roch Alum, two
drams: Juice of Liquorice, one dram: dissolve, filter, and mix therewith, syrup
of Mulberies, six ounces: mix them, with the former, and this he often Washed
and Gargled, to wit, four or five times a day, spitting out the Gargarism;
afterward he took a little of it down his Throat, now and then between whiles.

7. By this means the Ulcer became quickly healed, and the Cough with the
Catarrh were very much abated, in so much that in fourteen days time, we had
the prospect of a Cure; however, I ordered him to continue twice or thrice more
his Purging.

8. In the mean season, I caused him to take the Fumes of Amber up his Head by
his Mouth, through a Funel, which did him a vast deal of good, also every
Night, for sixteen or eighteen Nights together, I caused him to swallow twenty
grains of Mastich, which healed and corroberated the inward parts.

9. Afterward I caused him to take about four grains of My Laudanum in a
little Pill, at Night going to Bed, which he did for about fourteen or sixteen
days longer, by the use of which means his Catarrh Vanished, and he became
perfectly well.

VII. A Catarrh with the Vlceration of the Lungs.

1. A young Woman after her Lying in, by catching cold, got a mighty Hoarsness,
Cough, and Obstruction of the Lungs, with a vehement Catarrh; this continued
upon her, for three or four Months, during which time she took nothing, still
hoping every day to be better and better, but waiting long without any Comfort,
she found a necessity to apply her self to a Physician.

2. She now Spit vehemently, and almost continually, so what with Spiting,
Hawking, and Coughing, she voided a great quantity of Blood.

3. At length the Blood ceased, and she afterward Spit a filthy kind of
matter; sometimes frothy, and sometimes thick, which would be of a yellowish, or
greenish kind of Color, and sometimes little Lumps would be Spit forth, so
that some Physicians (and they who would be accounted Wise Men too) conceived
them to be Portions of the Lungs, others thought them to be only Coagulated
Blood.

4. However, whatever they were, our Patient grew weaker and weaker, and her
Body exceeding lean and tabified, so that in the Judgment of all Men, there was
an absolute Phthisis, which still grew worse and worse by reason of the
Contumacy of her Catarrh.

5. She requested My help, and I prescribed her the things following; by reason
of the thinness of her Body, I was loath to Purge her very much, therefore I
ordered her now and then to take Syrup of Roses Solutive.

6. And because of the Ulcer, as also that she had no Stomach to her Food: I
prescribed the Vulnerary spirit of Sulphur thus made: Take rectified spirit of
Wine, a quart: pure rectified Oil of Sulphur, two ounces: mix them, and digest
till they are almost sweet.

7. Of this I caused the Sick to take three, four, five or six times a day, and
sometimes oftener, about half a Spoonful of it, and sometimes more in a Glass of
Sack; this cleansed the Ulcer in the Lungs, and in a little time healed it,
also it begat a good Stomach in the Patient, whereby she could the better eat
her Food.

8. Sometimes also, for change, I caused her to take choice Canary, made
moderately bitter with Tincture of Wormwood, and sometimes the Tincture of
black Pepper in rectified Spirit of Wine, to forty, fifty, or sixty drops, in
any convenient Liquor; by which the native heat of her Stomach, became restored
and strengthened, so that she could Eat and Digest her Food very well.

9. However, that she might be always taking things conducing to her Health; I
ordered her often to Lick of this following Syrup: Take juice of Turnips,
squeezed out of Turnips baked dry in a Pan, a pint and half: Water distilled
out of Snails and Earthworms, a pint: Virgin Honey clarified, four pounds: mix
all together, melt and make a syrup in the heat of a Bath, of this she took
with a Liquorice stick between Meals, at lest ten or twelve times a day, which
comforted and strengthened the late indisposed Lungs.

10. Also I ordered her to take, every Morning fasting, and every Night going
to Bed fourteen, sixteen or twenty drops of the Annisated Balsam of Sulphur, by
which she found great good.

11. These things she continued the use of, for about seven or eight Weeks, at
what time we conceived the Lungs to be perfectly well, the Catarrh was also
much abated, but not wholly taken away.

12. After seven Weeks time, I caused her to receive several times the Fumes of
Amber, as mentioned in the former Observation, also I ordered her three or four
grains of My Laudanum to be taken every Night going to bed, by which the
Catarrh was perfectly removed: and this much to be deplored Sick Patient,
recovered her pristin Health.

13. Now here is to be noted, That during the greatest part of this Cure, her
Food was the Juice or Gravy of Meat, sometimes of Mutton, sometimes of Fowls,
but chiefly of Beef, which she took sometimes alone, sometimes with a little
Bread in it.

14. Her solid Food was chiefly Biscuit, Almonds blanched, Raisons of the Sun,
and her Drink was sometimes a Glass of Hyppocras, or Spiced Wine, but for the
most part Water distilled from Milk.

VIII. A Catarrh in a young Woman, accompanied with shortness of Breath, want
of Appetite, and a great pain in her Stomach.

1. This Woman was about twenty five years of Age, had been much troubled with
a Catarrh, but without any Ulceration of the Lungs, caused a great shortness of
Breath, and difficulty of Breathing; insomuch that she would sometimes Pant, as
if she strove for Life.

2. This continual flux having followed her for many Months, so cooled and
weakened the Ventricle, that she had scarcely any Appetite at all for her Food;
moreover, what she did Eat, she could not well Digest, and often times it would
come up again.

3. This was accompanied with such an extreme pain of the Stomach; which came
by fits, that she would often say, That nothing could equal that pain but the
pangs of Death.

4. These fits would last sometimes four or five hours at a time, in which
whatsoever she took, whether hot or cold, she received not the least benefit.

5. She had tried many things, and without success; as manifold Vomitings, and
Purgings, Clysters, she had also Blysters, Errhines, Sternutatories, Issues,
and had been many times Sweated; whereby although the fierceness of her
Catarrh, might be something remitted; yet she had not the least Ease as to the
pain of her Stomach.

6. Various sorts of Cordials, Stomaticks both hot and cold were given her, yet
every thing as to the pain of her Stomach proved successless.

7. They gave Specific Stomatick Cordial Pills, Stomatick Electuaries,
Antidotes, Pouders, Laudanum's, etc. and continued the use of them for many
Months; in so much, that there was nothing left undone, that was thought fit or
necessary for her.

8. But behold her Disease (Tyrant like) doubled its strength, and this
Stomatick pain seemed greater than ever; nor was her Catarrh in the least
lessened but afresh excited, so that hopeless of Remedy, she was given over by
all her other Physicians, expecting no Cure but by Death.

9. A Friend of hers desired her to make Trial of Me, which although she had
tried many Physicians in Vain, yet her almost daily Grief made her easy to be
Entreated; accordingly I was sent for, to whom she related the aforegoing
things.

10. I began to be Amazed in consideration of what Cause that might be, which
none of the foregoing Remedies could remove, but weighing the thing seriously,
I conceived it to be an Acid Salt lodged in the Blood, which was not only the
Cause of her Catarrh, but also of that vehement pain in her Stomach.

11. For the sharp Particles of the said Salt, did not only prick and vellicate
the Tunicles of the Stomach, but also by their perpetual supplys did in length
of time severely corrode it, whereby a great rawness was occasioned, which at
last afflicted her every day immediately after Eating.

12. For the fresh Food received in the Stomach, falling forthwith upon the raw
and Ulcerated parts, caused that immediate and extreme Pain, from which, she
could never be freed, till the Food was carried off from the Stomach, either
upward or downward: when the Food was carried off she was more at Ease, and so
remained as long as she remained fasting, but upon the fresh Eating of Food
again, her pain returned with the same vehemence.

13. I was dis-heartened from attempting any of the ways that had been hitherto
tried, from the Relation she gave Me; wherefore considering those things, and
the Causes by Me conceived, I judged the first Intention of Cure would be to
sweeten the Blood.

14. For this purpose, I ordered her the following Decoction: Take spring
Water, eighteen quarts; Mealy Sarsa, (steept over Night in the same Water being
warmed) sliced each branch or string into three or four pieces, two pounds and
half; Sarsafras rasped, Liquorice bruised, Raisons of the Sun stoned, Fat Figs
split, of each half a pound; boil all to the consumption of the half, strain
out, let it settle, and when cold, bottle it up, putting into each bottle, half
an ounce of white Sugar, and a quarter of a bruised Nutmeg, this was her
ordinary Drink, nor did I permit her to drink any other for three or four
months.

15. In the mean season, I gave her the following Powder three times a day,
viz. in the Morning fasting an hour before Dinner, and an hour before Supper,
which was about six of the Clock at Night.

16. Take Terra sigillata, two ounces: Pearls levigated, half an ounce:
Crab's-eyes, Amber prepared, of each two drams: Coral levigated, half a dram:
mix and make a Powder.

17. By the taking of these alone Medicaments, the whole Mass of Blood was
sweetened and freed from the Acid Salt, and in a few days the pain of her
Stomach vanished, to the admiration of her daily Associates, and in a few Weeks
the Ulcer being without doubt consolidated, she became perfectly free from that
Pain; nor was she ever after troubled with it, to her dying Day; which was
about four years after, she then dying in Childbed.

18. With the aforegoing Powder, I Cured a Maiden Gentlewoman about thirty
years of Age, after she had tried above a hundred things (as she said) without
any benefit, she also having a Catarrh as the other had, by the long taking of
the Decoction of Sarsa, the Catarrh went off, of its own accord, without any
other Remedy.

19. But this Decoction of Sarsa, as we have in some former places declared,
performs nothing without a great quantity of that Ingredient, and also that it
be taken for a long time, as the ordinary Drink, all other Liquors in the mean
season being forbidden.

IX. A Catarrh accompanied with a Scurvy.

1. A Man about thirty three years of Age, had a Catarrh followed him for many
Months, the Habit of his Body was cold, moist, and scorbutic, he had red spots
which did almost overspread his whole Body, as large almost as a silver Penny;
they appeared at certain times, continued for a season, and then dis-appeared;
sometimes they would be in his Arms, sometimes in his Legs, and sometimes in his
Thighs, sometimes on his Breast, and sometimes on all those parts at once.

2. Oftentimes he had wandering Pains afflicting him, but at no certain times;
his Stomach was cold, moist, and weak; in so much, that he had little or no
Appetite, and what he Eat, as badly Digested with him, he had a kind of
nauseousness or loathing, and many times an inclination to Vomit.

3. His Stomach was indeed so much out of Order, that it seemed to him to be
the Root and Cause of all his Distemper; for he did often say, If his Stomach
were well, he should be in perfect Health again.

4. He had been with several Physicians, who had prescribed many Comfortable,
Stomachical, and Cordial things, all which proved ineffectual to the end; he
applied himself to Me, and desired My assistance.

5. I first of all prescribed the following Clyster: Take Decoctum Commune,
fourteen ounces: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, four ounces: Honey, two ounces:
Benedicta Laxativa, six drams: mix them for a Clyster; this wrought very well,
and gave him six or eight Stools.

6. The next day, I gave him this following: Take the Infusion of Crocus
Metallorum, six drams: pure Salt of Vitriol, two drams: d^ssolve for one Dose,
it was given in the Morning fasting, and it gave eight or nine Vomits, drinking
Broth after it, by which means the Stomach was discharged of a vast quantity of
filthy, viscous, and pituitous Matter, and in about two or three days after, he
became lightsome and cheerful.

7. Afterward I purged him once in five or six days with the following
Cathartick: Take spring Water, one pound: Sena, one ounce: Anniseeds, half an
ounce: Salt of Tartar, two drams: Spanish Juice of Liquorice, one dram: digest,
and dissolve over a gentle heat for twenty four hours; then strain, let it
settle, and then decant off the clear Liquor for use, which will serve for four
Doses.

8. It is not to be imagined the great good the Sick received from this
Medicament: For it Purges gently and without griping, and carries off the
Morbifick Matter admirably.

9. Outwardly, I caused his Head, Temples, Forehead and Stomach, to be anointed
with the following Balsam: Take Oil of Nutmegs by expression, six drams: Oil of
Rosemary, three drams: Oil of Sassafras, a dram and half: mix them well
together, and anoint the foregoing places Morning and Evening, rubbing the
Balsam well in.

10. Having purged him three or four times, I caused him to Swallow every
Morning and Evening, half a dram of Mastich, by the use of which he confessed
he had great Comfort; his ordinary Drink was a Decoction of Guajacum and Sarsa,
with Seeds, which I Caused him to Drink, with the mixture of a half quantity of
the following Water.

11. Take Milk, six quarts: Scurvy Grass, six handfuls: Brooklime,
Watercresses, Garden-cresses, Tarragon, of each two handfuls: Carduus
Benedictus, Wormwood, of each three handfuls: Scordium, Germander, Bawm, of
each one handful and half: Centory the less, two handfuls and half: cut and
bruise them all, put them into the Milk, distill them in a glass Alembick in
Balneo Mariae to dryness; the Water cohobate upon the feces three or four
times, which Water mix two or three ounces at a time, with Decoction of
Guajacum beforementioned, and so let it be taken three, four or five times a
day.

12. Sometimes in the place of the Mastich before mentioned, I ordered the
following Powder to be taken, which is no contemptible thing: Take Terra
sigillata, six drams: white Amber levigated, four drams: mix them in a subtle
Powder, to be given Morning and Evening as the Mastich before mentioned.

13. To perfect the Cure of the Catarrh, after the former Medicines had been
taken twenty three, or twenty four days, I Caused him to receive the Fumes of
Amber up his Head through his Mouth by a Funnel four or five times a day, which
comforted the Head, and mightily dried up the cold and moist Humors.

14. Lastly, at about a Months end, I ordered the taking a little Pill of three
or four grains of My Laudanum, at Night going to bed, and to continue the same
about three Weeks time, by using of these Remedies the Sick became perfectly
well, and freed from all his Distempers.

15. A Gentlewoman much like afflicted as this Man, having been under a
perpetual Catarrh for almost two years, was Cured with the same Medicaments,
with a very little Alteration.

16. Also another Woman having lately lain in, by taking cold, was seized with
a vehement Catarrh, but she being Hysteric, instead of the foregoing
Antiscorbutick Water, I prescribed the following Anti-hysterick Water.

17. Take Cows Milk, six quarts: Tansy, Featherfew, Motherwort, of each four
handfuls: stinking Arrach, three handfuls: Castoreum sliced and bruised, four
ounces: the spleen of an Ox dried, sliced and bruised, 6 ounces: Nutmegs
bruised, one ounce: distill in a glass Alembick in Balneo Mariae to dryness,
which cohobate three or four times upon the faeces, distilling always to
dryness, and taking Care of Burning, in which distilled Water dissolve Volatile
Salt of Hartshorn, and of Amber, of each half an ounce: This was mixed with the
Guajacum Diet, two or three ounces at a time, and drunk, as aforesaid.

18. Another person subject to a Leipothymia or Swooning, had been obnoxious to
a fierce Catarrh for nine Months, who was Cured with the former Medicaments:
save only instead of the Antiscorbutick Water before mentioned, there was mixed
with the Guajacum Diet, one ounce or two of Angelica Water the greater
Composition; also I ordered the said Water, upon any fainting or illness at
Heart, to be taken one ounce or two alone, by which means she became perfectly
well.

19. Lastly, a noble Lady of about thirteen years of Age, having been for two
or three years past, afflicted with a Scorbutic Catarrh, being sometimes
better, sometimes worse, by following the Directions first above written, was
perfectly Cured in two Months time.

X. A Catarrh with a Vehement Pain of the Head, in a cold and moist
Constitution, and a Scorbutic habit of Body.

1. This befell a Woman of about forty eight years of Age, who was of a lusty
Body, fat and corpulent, smooth soft Skin, Flaxen colored Hair, and one that
seemed to be made rather for Ornament and Beauty Sake, than any other purpose;
her Urine was small in quantity, thin, clear and somewhat palish.

2. This Disease had afflicted her for about 18 or 20 Months; the Catarrh was
very troublesome to her, for sometimes she would be in danger of Choking: her
Headache was apparently a Cephalaea, and probably might arise by consent from
her Stomach; for her Stomach was often out of order, weak, and the digestive
Faculty almost overcome.

3. The whole habit of her Body abounded with a cold and watery humor; and
sometimes out of her Stomach would she spontaneously cast a pint or more of
clear Water, without any praevious Sickness of that Bowel, or any disposions to
Vomit; and sometimes she would have a Sickness at Heart, as if she would Dye
away immediately.

4. These last Symptoms were great demonstrations of a Scorbutic habit, which
Disease is called Stomacace in Greek, as if one should say the Stomach Disease;
however to confirm this Opinion, she had wandering redish, or violet colored
Spots, appearing at times all over her whole Body, chiefly in her Arms, Thighs,
and Legs.

5. The Cause of all this Disease, was the fluxion of the Acid Salt in the
Blood, by reason of which there was a Coagulation (as it were) of the thicker
parts of the Blood; and a too plentiful Separation of the Serum, which Serous
juice was emptied into Various parts of the Body, in its passage or
circulation; for as much as the Blood being weakened, and undon in its Crassis,
it was unable to carry with it, its Serum as it ought to do, and so to convey it
to the Reins, as its proper Receptacles.

6. Hence it came to pass, that part of that Serum was emptied into the
Stomach, whence its exceeding moisture, part into the Vessels of the Lungs,
whereby she had withal some shortness of Breath; part into the Cavities of the
Brain, whence also those many excrements which she avoided, partly by the
Palate, partly by the Nose.

7. This Disease had been of a pretty long standing, which made it so much the
harder to Cure, for as much as the whole Body seemed to be contaminated with
that Acid juice: moreover, the whole habit was cold and moist, and such
Diseases never admit of the easiest cure: However I did not despair, since her
Age was not extreme, nor was her Strength much impared; and she her self was of
an observant, willing, cheerful, and believing Mind, which in this C^se is of
no small advantage to the regaining of Health; nor could we perceive the Nerves
to be any way afflicted.

8. Truly the Disease is complicate, and therefore so must be the Indications
of Cure; for though the Catarrh be the principal mattter afflicting, yet with
such things as are proper thereto, we must always mix Cephalicks, and
Antiscorbuticks, not forgeting also sometimes to mix with them Antithydropicks.

9. And as the cause of the Disease is an acid Salt dissolved in the Blood and
for the most part fixed; it is necessary not only to begin, but also to
continue the Cure with such as are Alcalies, and chiefly such as are Volatile;
and sometimes also in this case nitrous Salts may, not be amiss, if given in a
fit time, and by a Wise Hand.

10. For they not only in part absorbe the acid Salt in the blood; but
certainly makes the flammula Cordis much more clear, and also so comfort and
strengthen the Blood in restoring it to its due Crassis, that it may be able to
carry along with it its Serum to empty it by the Emulgent Arteries into the
Reins.

11. That these things might be both securely and pleasantly accomplished, I
prescribed the Lunar Pills to be given for a while twice a Week, and afterward
but once a Week; Rhubarb, which Momanus so much commends against Fevers, I
found of great use here, being taken for a pretty while, after the ceasing, to
take the Lunar Pills.

12. Take Endive water a pint: choice Rhubarb, half an ounce: make an Infusion
in twenty four hours, then strain out by pressing: the dose from one ounce to
three or four every morning, according to Age and Strength: This being given
long, opens Obstructious; carrys off the Morbifick Matter, though it be never
so gross, viscous, and strongly impacted in the Body; but it ought not to be
given over till the Obstruction is wholly removed.

13. Also for change of the Purging matter, by reason the Disease was stubborn
and of long continuance, I now and than gave her Decoction or Tincture of
Colocynthis, which evacuated and dried the Head marvellously.

14. This following Powder I gave her to half a dram, or two scruples; she took
it mixed with Conserve of Roses every Morning and Night in the intervals of
Purging; Take Mastick, Olibanum, of each an ounce and half: Amber one ounce:
Musk one dram and half: Ambergrise, half a dram: make all into a fine powder
and mix them: I put in the Perfumes, for that they were greateful to her;
Moreover, from the use of this Powder, she Confessed she received a very great
Benefit.

15. By the Nostrills I derived the offending matter by proper Errhines and
Sternutatorys, The Errhine I exhibited was this: Take Juyces of sweet Marjoram,
Primroses, and of Betony, of each three ounces: white Wine, six ounces: in
which one scruple of Euphorbium was dissolved: Musk, eight grains: mix them,
and let it be given an hour and half before going to Bed.

16. After the Errhine had been used three times, and with very good Success,
viz, one every third day, I gave the Sternutatory following: Take Powder of
black Hellebor, Powder of Liquorice, of each one ounce: Powder of white
Hellebor, two drams: this I caused to be exhibited now and than, as I saw
occasion.

17. Also during this whole Cure, the Diet which I ordered her to take and keep
to as her common Drink, was this following: Take Spring Water, twenty quarts:
Wood of Guajacum, Sassafras, Sarsa, China, Liquorice, of each half a pound: fat
Figgs slit, Raisons of the Sun stoned, of each ten ounces: boil all to the
Consumption of eight quarts; then strain, being almost cold put to it three
pints of Juice of Scurvy Grass, Horse Raddish root Rasped vj: Sugar, twelve
ounces: Ale Yest, a pint: make it gentle to ferment, then Bottle it up, putting
in each Bottle a Clove slit, and one scruple of Salt of Amber. Of this she
drank about a Bottle a Day, and repeated the whole quantity four times.

18. I commended to her the Drinking of Pope Adrian his Wine; Or the Vinum
Cephallicum, also the Vinum Stomachicum Mylij, and the Vinum Moschatum
Mynsichti; but she took the following Compositum: Take choice Canary, five
quarts: Anacardiums, Nutmegs, of each one ounce: Cinnamon, six drams: Cubebs,
Mace, yellow Sanders, Wood of Aloes, of each three drams: Citron peels the
yellow, one dram: Cloves bruised, half a dram: Musk, a scruple: Ambergrise,
half a scruple: being all in gross Powder mix them, digest in the Wine twenty
days, shaking the glass every day; then being settled decant the clear Liquor
into another glass, which keep for use: upon the Magma remaining, I ordered
another gallon of Canary to be put.

19. Of the first Infusion (dulcified with treble refined Sugar) she took every
Morning a little Sack glass full, immediately after her Mastick powder and
Conserves of Roses: half an hour before Dinner she drank almost such another
glass; and again last at Night going to Bed, after the Powder aforesaid and
Conserve, she took another glass, this she did for about five Weeks, at what
time, she said she found her self very well.

20. But I that knew the obstinancy of her Disease, and how apt such kind of
Catarrhs are to return again, advised her to continue taking some other things
for a while; amongst which I prescribed this of Solenander: Take Frankincense,
juice of Liquortce, of each a dram: Myrrh, Opium, Saffron, of each a scruple:
with Syrup of Poppies make Pills; of this she took every night going to Bed,
for the first eight days a scruple only; afterward she increased the Dose to
two scruples.

21. After she had continued the use of the former things, for about eighteen
or twenty days; I gave her My Laudanum, she begun with it at two grains, and
increased the Dose half a grain every fifty day, till she came to six grains;
which she took for about eight Weeks.

22. That time being over, I ordered her again to take the Amber Powder before
described with Conserve of Roses; and to continue taking the same, for the
space of two or three months.

23. Outwardly, I caused her Hair to be shaved off her whole Head; and the
same, together with the Nape of the Neck, as also her Forehead and Temples
were anointed with this following Balsam: Take Oil of Nutmegs by expression,
four ounces: Chemical Oils of Rosmary, of Sage, of Sweet Marjoram, of Angelica,
of Origanum, of Amber, of each one dram: mix them well together; with this the
whole Head, and parts adjacent, were anointed morn^ng and evening, for sixteen
or eighteen days.

24. While this anoin^ing was doing a Cucapha, or quilted Cap of Spices was
prepared, which she put on upon her head every time after anointing.

25. The time of anointing being over, which as we said, was in about eighteen
days space; her Head was Shaved again with a Raisor; and upon the naked Skin
was applied Emplastrum Cephalicum of the shops, which she wore for a long time:
By the use of these Medicines as we have here declared, she became perfectly
well.

XI. A thin Catarrh, falling upon the Breast and Joints.

1. A Man about forty three years of Age had been for a long time even many
years troubled with a thin and salt Catarrh, by reason of which he was almost
always a Spitting, his Spittle was thin, a little viscous, but exceeding Salt,
as if he had Salt always in his Mouth.

2. It afflicted much his Lungs, by reason of which he had a kind of Asthma, or
great difficulty of Breathing: Moreover the defluxion was continued to many
other parts of the Body, especially to the extreme; in so much, that he had
often wandering pains about him.

3. Sometimes they would be fixed in a Joint for two or three Weeks together,
so that he would be in a manner Lame, sometimes his Arms, Legs, and sometimes
his Feet would be as it were benumbed, wherein he neither was sensible of
Pleasure nor Pain, but the Distemper seemed to incline to a Palsy, such was the
Mutability of this his Protean Disease.

4. The Cause hereof was no doubt a thin Lymphatick Juice, not only overflowing
the Lungs, but also oppressing the Original of the Nerves themselves, whence
proceeded that Numbness.

5. The Cause of the Pain in the Joints no doubt proceeded from a weakness of
those parts, wherein Nature for their relief, sending a great flux of Animal
Spirits, by their tumultuous occurse to these parts, making a Collision or
striking one against another, and also in some measure extending the sensible
Nerve, forthwith excited the Pain.

6. The Cure of this Distemper, we prognosticated to be of exceeding great
difficulty, as well in respect of its long continuance, as from its resisting
all extraordinary Medicines; and the Nature and Disposition of the Humor
afflicting and the parts afflicted; for as much as Diseases long fixed in the
extreme parts are not easily to be removed.

7. He had tried many things by the advice of several Learned Men, by means of
which, he thought he received a very great advantage, and sometimes he thought
himself to be almost well, when presently his Disease would return again with
great Impetuosity.

8. He had been often times let Blood, and a great quantity at times taken from
him; but this in my opinion rather augmented than diminished his Distemper, for
losing such a quantity of Blood, it apparently decayed his Strength, and much
weakened him, and then it naturally follows for all Catarrhs mightily to advance
according to the Diminition of Strength.

9. They also strongly Purged him, and that often times, which although I deslike
not the Act of Purging, yet I much disliked the quality and manner of
Administration.

10. For as the Disease had been of many years standing and continual, so
instead of giving now and than a Dose of violent Pills, it had been much better
to have Instituted a gentle and constant Purging Diet, which he might have
taken, if occasion had been, for an hundred days together, and such an one as
follows, I instituted him.

11. Take new Ale four or five gallons, put into it these following things,
Sena, fourteen ounces: Polypody, Juniper Berries well bruised, Coriander-seed,
Zedoary, all of them well bruised, of each half a pound: dried Rosemary,
Betony, Sage, Stoechas, of each four ounces: Bay Berries hull'd and grossly
bruised, Sal Prunella, of each two ounces: put them into a Bag with a stone in
it, to make it sink, and let them Work up with the Ale, after four or five
days, he drank of it every Morning a little draught, and accordingly increased
or diminished, the quantity as he found it to Purge him.

12. This quantity being taken, I Caused him to repeat it again; adding to the
former Ingredients these, Scurvy Grass, Brooklime, Watercresses, Tarragon, of
each three handfuls, all bruised: Mustard Seed bruised, Horseradish root,
Rocket-seed, of each two handfuls and half; he continued the taking of this
last quantity till it was all spent, which Purging very gently and pleasingly,
carried off the Morbifick matter, and thoroughly cleansed his whole Body.

13. But that we might not seem only to remove the Conjoined Cause by Purging
only: I Caused him to take the following Dose to Sweat upon: Take choice Bezoar
Mineral, twelve grains: Oriental Bezoar, ten grains: Volatile Salts of Amber
and Hartshorn, of each eight grains: Viper Powder, a scruple: mix them together
with half a dram of Mithridate, and give it the Sick to Swallow, for a Dose to
provoke Sweat, drinking after it a little choice Canary, mixed with six drams
of Treacle Water, being in his Bed and well covered, this Caused him to Sweat
very powerfully, and from whence he Confessed he had wonderful relief.

14. As to Topics his Stomach, Head and Temples was anointed with this
following Balsam: Take Oil of Nutmegs by expression, one ounce: Opo-balsamum,
half an ounce: distilled Oil of Nutmegs, of Rosemary, of sweet Marjoram, and of
Sassafras, of each one dram: mix, and anoint therewith Morning and Evening,
keeping those parts warm.

15. The extreme parts either benumbed after the manner of a Palsy, or pained
in the Joints, resembling a Gout; I Caused every Morning and Evening to be
anointed with the following Medicament: Take Powers of Amber, six ounces:
choice Camphir, one ounce: dissolve it therein, and herewith Bath well the
afflicted parts, it is not to be imagined, what sudden and great relief he
received therefrom.

16. For in the extremity of his Pain, the said Pain would vanish in a Moment,
and although Lame, he would be able to go very well in two or three days time.

17. Now it is to be observed, that during the time of his Purging, I ordered
him to Swallow whole every Night going to bed, twenty five or thirty grains of
choice white Olibanum or Mastich, sometimes the one, sometimes the other, with
about ten grains of pure white Ginger, cut into very small bits.

18. The time of Purging being wholly over, viz. so long as he was drinking the
two former quantities of Diet, I caused him to take every Morning fasting half
an ounce of this following Electuary, whereby the Stomach, Head, Brain, and
Animal Spirits were mightily relieved, Comforted and Strengthened.

19. Take the soft or Melligenous extract of Juniper Berries, half a pound:
Viper powder, Powder of Zedoary, of Nutmegs, of each one ounce and half: Powder
of white Ginger, of Cloves, of each half an ounce: Camphir, a dram: Venice
Treacle, three ounces: extracts of Virginian Snake-root and Contra yerva, of
each two ounces: mix them for a Stomachical and Cephalic Antidote. This is
very good against all sorts of salt and sharp Catarrhs, moisture of the Brain,
coldness and weakness of the Stomach and Paralitick and Arthritick Distempers.

20. At Night going to Bed, he took two, three or four grains of my Laudanum,
the use of these two last Medicines, he constantly took Morning and Night for
five or six Weeks together; by the use whereof he became perfectly Restored,
and was free from all the said disaffections, for more then seven years
afterward.

XII. A Catarrh in a Gentlewoman accompaned with Hysteric fits: and an
exceeding Pain on her left side; supposed an affection of the Spleen.

1. This Gentlewoman being about thirty years of Age, had been obnoxious to a
Catarrh, almost from a Child, with swellings in her Throat and Almonds of the
Ears, soreness and difficulty of swallowing, but of late, to wit, for four or
five years last pass, the Catarrh was almost Continual, and she had with it a
great dejection of Spirit.

2. She would sight often and complain of a great pain in her left Side, and
many times would be overtaken or seized with fits of the Mother; the Cause
thereof she apprehended to be from an unnatural Marrage, being allied to a man,
extremely wicked almost in all senses.

3. She was a very Comely Lady, and brought with her a great Fortune: but was
almost at first slighted and abused by her Husband; whence arose a great
discontent of mind which seizing and Continuing long upon her, begat a kind of
Melancholy habit.

4. Not long after, she was as she thought afflicted with the Pain of the
Spleen; which she Conceived was increased by taking an extreme Cold, however a
Pain she had in her left Side and that almost continually: her Catarrh was
almost always the same, causing her constantly to spit, and very much
afflicting her in the Night.

5. The beginning of this Discontent brought also upon her those Hysteric fits;
the Cause of which is a preternatural Convulsion of the Nerves of the Mesentery
and Middriff or Diaphragma; whereby that exceeding great rising up into the
Breast not much unlike a Ball or Globe is made.

6. And I am the more Confirmed in this opinion, That these Fitts are often
Caused, as aforesaid, and not always simply from the Womb, from that singular
observation of Dr. Willis, who beheld the same in a Man, where the old supposed
Cause was impossible to be Suspected, and in the time of my practice, I have
seen two such l^ke examples, which has very much confirmed me in this Judgment,
not that I will totally deny any Cause to be Inherent in the Womb in all
persons.

7. For I doubt not, but where there are great Obstructions of the Matrix, and
that part abounds with many stinking and noysom humors, it being as it were
the very sink of a Woman's Body, that Vapors may be Emitted from thence, and
that it may also have a share in the Cause of Hysteric Paroxisms.

8. The original Cause of the Catarrh, I attribute to be in part from a
Discrasy of the Blood and in part from a natural weakness of the Brain, whereby
it is made more apt to Receive the Recrements of the second Concoction; in the
midst of all these Griefs this Lady's body was much wasted and pined away, so
that an Atrophia had taken a real possession of her.

9. She had been almost always taking Physic from her Childhood, either to
take away or prevent the Catarrh, to which she had been so long obnoxious, she
many times received good but no Cure; In so much that at small distances it
again Returned upon her.

10. Her present affliction which had also been of some years standing, her
Physicians concluded to be a Catarrh accompanied with an Hectic Fever; and
one of them, no mean man in his own Esteem, prodigally declared it to be an
Incurable Marasmos (I hope the Lady was satisfied that this Gentleman was wholly
unfit for her Cure.)

11. She had been my Intimate Acquaintance some years while she was under these
Illnesses, before I any wise Engaged in the Cure, but having Occasion to be
often at her house, she would Relate to me the advice and pactise of her
Physicians, and often times asked me my thoughts thereof.

12 I was very sparing in delivering my opinion, doing with all in part as I
would be done by, but if things were at any time manifestly injurious, I
som^imes have told her the truth.

13. She having now made trial for a long time of many men, and tired her self
with Running new Courses of Physic, was Resolved to give them over, and she
would often say to me, that to her they were all Physicians of no Value.

14. Hereupon she Entreated my help, and that since she was declared Incurable
and left as Remediless by other methods, that I would try what I Could do: I
first of all ordered her a strong decoction of Sarsa to be made, as follows.
Take Spring water, eighteen quarts, mealy Sarsa split, each string into three
or four pieces, two pound and half: Sassafras, eight ounces: Juice of
Liquorice, one ounce: Raisons of the Sun, fat figgs split, each half a pound:
Coriander seeds bruised, six ounces; boil all except the seeds to the
consumption of seven or eight quarts, toward the end of the Boiling put in the
seeds, which Boil a little, being almost cold, strain hard out by pressing,
being thoroughly settled, decant off the clear and put it up into Bottles,
putting into each Bottle a Clove spit, half an ounce of Refined sugar, and two
scruples of the Volatile Salt of Amber; let it be close stopped up.

15. Of this she drank a bottle a day and sometimes more, the use of this Diet
was Repeated and continued full an hundred days, by which a very great
Alteration was made in the whole habit of her Body, and this long lasting
Catarrh was wholly vanished, and the salt taste in her Mouth was totally taken
away; so that she felt it no more.

16. Now by reason she had very much and often purged, I praetermitted for a
while that Intention, and only made use of it now and then, as once in three
weeks or a month, to cleanse the Bowels, when I caused her to Purge it was for
the most part with Tinctura Melanagoga Grulingij.

17. Every night going to Bed, during all the time of her taking the
aforementioned Diet, she took of this following Electuary: Take Electuarium ad
Tabidos, four ounces: extracts of Virginian snake root and Contrayerva, of each
two ounces: Extract of Saffron, one ounce: Volatile salt of Hartshorn and
Amber, Volatile salt of man's Skull, of each one dram and half: powder of
Misletoe of the Oak, native Cinnabar, of each one dram: salt of Vipers, half a
dram: Camphir, a scruple: Syrup of the Juice of Alkermes, enough to make it
into an Electuary.

18. By the taking of this Medicine she found an incredible Relief, the
Obstruction of her Lungs were removed, and the Pain of her Side vanished, not
long after I prescribed this Medicament: Take Musk, fourteen grains:
Ambergrise, five grains: Civet, one grain: with two or three grains of Liquid
storax, make four Pills for one Dose, to be taken in the Morning, and fasting,
two or three hours after them; immediately after the taking of these Pills, she
took a little glass of this following mixture: Take Orange-flower-water, twelve
ounces: Syrup of Violets, three ounces: mix them for three Morning.

19. Now and then between Meals, she took of this following mixture: Take Bawm
and Angelica waters simple, of each six ounces: Orange-flower-water, eight
ounces: Aqua Hysterica 4 ounces: Spirit of sal Armoniack, two scruples: mix
them to be taken twice a day, two or three ounces at a time between Meals.

20. Outwardly, the Forehead, Temples, and Nape of the Neck were Bathed Morning
and Evening with the Powers of Rosemary, and sometimes with the Powers of Amber,
and sometimes with the Balsam of Nutmegs, mentioned in the former Observation.

21. Her Stomach and Side likewise were Bathed twice a day, with the Powers of
Amber; for about sixteen or eighteen days, afterward the following Plaster
was applied over the Left Side and Region of the Spleen: Take Emplast.
Cephalicum, Emplastrum of Ammoniacum, of each one ounce and half: Liquid
storax, six drams: mix and make a Plaster to be spread upon Leather and to be
applied, as aforesaid.

22. Before the stopping of the Catarrh, which as we have before said was
chiefly done by the continual Drinking of the Decoction of Sarsa, she did for
four or five several days take sometimes the Fumes of Amber, sometimes the
Fumes of Mastich up her Head, by her Mouth through a funnel. This was done four
or five, or six times a day according as she her self pleased.

23. By using of the means above prescribed, she became very well: however I
thought it necessary (to Confirm the same more effectually) that she should
take my Laudanum three or four grains at Night going to bed for three or four
Weeks; which accordingly she did.

24. Thus while we thought her to be well, she was taken with a great stoppage
of Urine, which was in part Removed by taking the aforesaid Laudanum, but more
Effectually by drinking after the said little Pill a small draught of this
following Infusion: Take white Wine or Rhenish, a quart: a very large Onion
sliced extremely thin, and forty winter Cherries, Reduced into powder: mix all
together and Infuse in a gentle heat twenty four hours, then decant off the
clear Liquour, which keep in a glass Bottle to be used as aforesaid.

25. The use of the Laudanum and this last Medicine not only Confirmed the
former Cure, but also perfectly took away her Pain and stoppage of Urine, from
all which Diseases she has lived perfectly free for the space of ten or twelve
years.

Observations from other Authors.
XIII. Of a Catarrh, with a Cough, Fever, Fainting-fits. etc.

1. Mr. Martin Graphius the Learned and most Faithful Pastor of the Church of
Christ at Hochstadt, about the forty seventh year of his Age, was vexed with
the aforesaid Symptoms whom I Cured, by these few Medicaments following.

2. Take Extract of Esula, two scruples: Fountain Water, six ounces: mix them,
and press out the Liquors. This potion he drank Cold, and avoided many
Phlegmatic and Choleric Excrements, and soon after began to mend.

3. A sweating Decoction. His body being well Purged, he did Sweat five days
together in his Bed, drinking eight ounces: of this following Decoction hot.
Take Centory flowers, two handfulls, Fountain water and Wine, of each two pints
and a half: boil all till half the Liquor be Consumed. This sweating did him so
much good, that he professed himself thereby quite Cured.

4. Diet; his table Drink, by my Advice was this following Decoction. Take
French Barley, three ounces; Hyssop, two handfulls; Roses, Violets, of each one
pugil; Liquorice, three drams: six figgs, three ounces of Raisons, and one
ounce of Sugar Candy: boil all in a sufficient Quantity of Water, to a third
part remaining, Rulandus Cent. 2. Observe: 45.

XIV. A Catarrh with other Symptoms.

1. The Noble Gentleman Mr. Gulielmus Hebrardus Lord of Miravaulx, thirty years
of Age, of a petuitous and Melancholy Constitution, was afflicted with a
stubborn infirmity attended with many Symptoms, such an Extreme heaviness of
his whole Body that he could not, sometimes stir himself, with so deplorable a
weakness, that he was ready to faint away.

2. Also about Noon and in the Evenings, a thin and sharp defluxion fell down
upon his Lungs, which Caused a very tedious dry Cough, and made him greatly
fear a Consumption; but that which rendered him the more Melancholy and pensive,
was the Death of his two Sisters, which was occasioned by a Consumption, and
himself had been also afflicted with spitting of Blood; and that which yet made
his Condition more Miserable, was, that he would not Advise with his
Physicians, because all Medicaments were so loathsome to him, as that he
Immediately Vomited them up again.

3. His Worthy Wife seeing his Infirmity growing worse and worse, sent for me,
and being sufficiently Informed of the Disease, I mentioned several Remedies
ordinarily used, which he not liking, I propounded some very well tasted
Medicaments, which I did not doubt but would Effect a Cure, and Repossess him
of his former Health; he being not unwilling on this Condition to take my
Advice, I prescribed these following Broths.

4 First, Take Roots of Bugloss and Asparagus, of each one ounce: leaves of
Agrimony, Burnet, Scabious and Maidenhair, of each one handful; Cream of
Tartar, one dram boil all with a quarter of an old Cock and make Broth, which
is to be used six days together. By which he was purged downwards twice or
thrice a day, and said he found himself somewhat better.

5: Afterward I prescribed him this following powder: Take Salt of Tamarisk,
Magistery of Tartar, and Milk of Sulphur, of each one dram: mix them into a
Powder, of which let him take half a dram every morning, with some of the
aforesaid Broth.

6. Having used this Remedy six days together; he was Purged on the seventh
with this following Powder. Take Sena and Cream of Tartar, of each one scruple;
Diagridium, eight grains: Cinnamon, four grains: of my specific Cephalic
Powder, five grains: with this Medicament he voyded an Incredible quantity of
pituitous humors, both by Stool and Vomit, without any trouble, the Humors
resembled whites of Eggs; also they descended from his Brain into his Mouth in
so great quantity, that the Patient found it somewhat difficult to bring them
all out even by Hauking.

7. He now rendered his Urine much more plentifully than formerly. The same day
he was so Eased and Cheared, that he professed he was Cured; But because his
whole Body was filled with abundance of humors, I ordered him to take the
foresaid Powder again for six days, and on the seventh to Purge again, which
advice he diligently followed, and the success was as before: only he voided
not so much Excrementitious matter as formerly, it being much abated by the
former Purgation.

8. After his being the second time Purged, he went into a Bath made of Barley,
Almonds and cold Seeds, being luke warm, for two days together, Morning and
Evening to moisten his overheated and dried Bowels; After the Bath, he used the
said Powder, three days together, and at last was perfectly Cured. Riverius

XV. Of a Catarrh with a Cough in a Infant.

1. The Son of Monsiure Bojauques, Controler in the Chamber of Accounts at
Montpeliere: eleven months old, was sick of a Catarrh, with a continual Cough
and Fever, he frequently Vomited Phlegm, he sucked much, and Pist little.

2. After many Medicaments used to little purpose, I ordered them to anoint the
Region of his Kidneys with oil of Scorpions of Matthiolus thrice a day,
whereupon he made Urine more plentifully; and his Catarrh was abated.

3. For Mercatus says, in his eight Book, of the Diseases of Children, that
Catarrhs happens in Children sometimes by fault and through weakness of the
Kidneys; when they do not draw the Wheyish humor; whence it comes to pass,
that the said humor being drawn upwards, becomes matter of a Catarrh.

4. If that Symptom had continued, those Remedies had been used which are
propounded by the said Mercatus, Chap. 13. Where he Treats of Urine in Children
suppressed, as Clysters, oppening Broths; etc. Riverius Cent. 1. Obser. 55.

XVI. A Catarrh falling upon the Lungs.

1. About the end of October, 1642, I fell in a grivous Catarrh by being in the
Sun, which falling upon my Lungs made me short Winded and Wheeze.

2. I was let Blood, and then Purged for two days together, with a Laxative
Ptisan, abstaining from Wine, and Keeping a very slender Diet: by which means
my Wheezing ceased, and my Shortness of Breath was much abated.

3. But there followed in their stead a very troublesome Cough, which having
Continued two days, in the morning I put a bit of Tobacco in my Mouth, having
first lightly ground it With my Teeth, which when I had Kept half an hour upon
my Tongue, my Head began to be a little dizy, and my Stomach somewhat Sick,
after which followed a small Vomit of Wheyish matter, which had a
bitter-farewell with it.

4. The Dizziness of my Head Continued for two hours, and my Cough was stayed
ti^l Evening, when it began a little to trouble me by fits; about Supper time,
a pain arose in my Head, with a Certain heat; Especially on the Left side.

5. After Supper, which was plentiful enough, My Headache was much worse, and
was accompanied with a troublesome Sickness at My Stomach, which having
continued for an hour, and the Headache growing worse and worse, thrusting my
Finger down My Throat, I cast up all My Supper with much Phlegm, whereupon My
Headache was abated, and soon after I went to Bed, where falling a Sleep, I past
the Night quietly, and was the following day, quite freed from my Catarrh and
Cough. Riverius Cent. 2. Observe. 190.

XVII. A Catarrh with Hoarsness.

1. About the end of October 1643. when the South Wind began to blow, I was
troubled with a Catarrh falling upon my breast, which made me exceeding Hoarse,
and almost speechless; which to help, I evacuated with a Laxative Ptisan, which
I took twice a day and 2 days together.

2. This Cured my Hoarsness, and in the day time I seemed to be free from the
Catarrh; but in the Night about Midnight, the defluxion increased, and Caused
perpetual Coughing, so that I was forced to Rise again from my bed.

3. For the Cure whereof, I took away ten ounces of Blood; yet the Night
following the same Cough returned, which could no otherwise be stopped but by
Rising out of my Bed.

4. The day after my Blood-letting, I seemed free from the Catarrh; but at
Midnight My Cough came again, which effectually to allay, I took presently
three grains of Laudanum; and going to bed again half an hour after; I past the
rest of the Night without Cough or Defluxion, in a very delicate Sleep; and the
following Nights, neither Cough or Catarrh appeared any more.

5. When the Disease was most troublesome, I abstained from Wine, using for my
Drink a Ptisan made of Liquorice and Coriander-seed. Riverius Cent. 3. Obs. 215.

XVIII. A Catarrh flowing upon the Lungs.

1. At the end of Febr. 1644. I was afflicted with a most grievious Catarrh
falling down upon my Lungs, whereupon a vehement Cough afflicted me day and
night, with a shortness of Breath, so that I could not lie in My bed.

2. For the Cure whereof, I was let Blood four times, and in the space of
fifteen days Purged as many times, Cupping-Glasses were applied, and a
Vesicatory, with many thickning Medicaments against the Cough; I had also a
small Fever, which threatened an Inflammation of my Lungs.

3. Although I am wont to be afflicted twice or thrice in a year with these
Catarrhs, yet I had never any so tedious and stubborn, so that I much feared it
would turn to a Consumption; seeing all Remedies wrought no effect, which at
other times did me good.

4. Supposing therefore, that I must use some effectual Medicine to carry off
the Defluxion, I took twenty grains of Calomelanos, and ten grains of Jallap;
By virtue of which Remedy, I voided by Stool much Pituitous and Choleric
Matter, such as my other Purgations did not bring away, and by Coughing and
Spitting, I voided much Phlegm at my Mouth, which Evacuation continuing two days
together, my Catarrh ceased, and my Cough left me; and so I was freed (by the
goodness of God) from that troublesome D^sease. Riverius Cent. 3. Observe. 228.

XIX. A universal Catarrh on all the Joints.

1. Monsieur De Barri, Eldest Son of Monsieur De Rochemore, chief President in
the Supreme Court of Accounts and Subsidies in Montpelier, at the beginning of
August, 1644. began to be afflicted with an universal Rheumatism; infesting
almost all the Joints of his Body with a continual Fever, and extreme Crudity
of Urines.

2. This Disease was occasioned chiefly through unseasonable Swimming; for
going in the heat of Summer, to a River far from the City, he bathed his heated
body in the Water, whence that universal Catarrh did proceed.

3. For six Weeks all the Medicines he took, seemed to do no good, the pains
did run up and down to several parts, and did frequently return upon him. Now
the Remedies were, viz. Blood letting ten times, cooling and thickning Juleps,
to which were added twice or thrice Purgations.

4. But the Disease continuing, at last there was given a Bolus of Conserve of
Roses, with twenty grains of Calomelanos, and six grains of extract of Jallap
every third day.

5. He voided many wheyish and leek Colored Excrements, with which Remedy four
times used, all the pains were taken away; and afterward the Phlegmatic
Tumors which remained in the Joins; especially of the Feet, were discussed
with Resolving and Roberating Plasters. Riverius Cent. 3. Observe. 241.

XX. Of a Catarrh falling upon the Lungs.

1. The 14 of October 1644. the South-Winds having blowed for an whole Month
together, that hot and moist season, was Changed into a cold and dry, viz. The
North Wind blowing by means whereof, though for two days immediately
preceeeding I had been Purged by a Laxative Ptisan and Manna, a Deflux of Rhume
fell upon my Lungs, which Caused me to Cough, fetch my Wind short, and to
Wheeze a little.

2. For two days it did not much molest me, so that I walked about the City;
nevertheless, the third day, my Disease increasing I took an ounce of Manna,
and four grains of the Rosin of Jallap, with which I was but little Purged, and
therefore I took the same Night some Laxative Ptisan with Manna, and was
plentifully Purged, in the Course of that Night.

3. On the fourth day I Dined Lightly, and five hours after Dinner, I took the
same Laxative Ptisan, and it wrought well upon Me that Night.

4. On the fifth day, about bed time, my Catarrh being not yet gone, though
much abated, I took three grains of Laudanum, my Catarrh ceased presently, and
I slept quietly all that Night.

5. Yet, because on the sixth day in the Morning, a small Wheezing might be
heard in my Breast, with a light shortness of Breath, I was resolved to wast
those Relics by fasting.

6. Wherefore keeping in my Bed all that day; I took only one Mess of Broth at
Dinner time, and some Barley Broth at Supper time: I slept quietly all Night,
and my Catarrh was quite discussed.

7. Howbeit a slight pain arose on my Right Jaw Bone, which I was presently rid
off by a flux of Blood out of the Gum where the Tooth was Rotten; there came
away drop by drop about three ounces of Blood mingled with Phlegm. Riverius
Cent. 3. Observe. 244.

XXI. A Catarrh with Hoarseness.

1. On the seventh of November 1644. The South Wind blowing, I was taken with a
Catarrh, and a Hoarsness, the second day I kept my Bed, and took nothing all
day, but two Messes of Barley broth at Dinner and Supper time, the third day I
took a Laxative Ptisan, and an ounce of Manna; The fourth day I rested, and my
Hoarsness was very much abated; on the fifth day I had a dry-Cough, which made
me open a Vein.

2. On the sixth my Cough continued, therefore I took twenty grains of
Calomelanos, and eight grains of Resin of Jallap. The Medicament wrought not
all day, only toward Night it gave me two very small Stools. Howbeit my Cough
was quite discussed. Riverius Cent. 3. Observe. 246.

XXII. A cruel Catarrh with diverse Complications of Fevers.

1. The first day of May 1645. I was called to the Lady of Beaufort, lying Sick
at her Mothers Madam du Pelou's House in the Castle of Bayart, not far from
Rhodanus; she was thirty five years old, of a Sanguine Complexion.

2. For an whole Month she had been troubled with a cruel Catarrh and a
Continual Fever, to which were added fits of an Ague, which came twice a day,
viz. at ten in the Morning, and six in the Evening; with these a most vexatious
Cough did trouble her night and day, with which she brought up abundance of
Crude Phlegm, and could take no rest.

3. In a Months time she had been five times let Blood by order of Dr. Chaumel,
her ordinary and most expert Physician; she had been thrice Purged, and many
other Remedies had been used, of which one did her the most good, viz. a Bolus
of three grains of Laudanum, with Conserve of Roses, which for twelve hours did
quite stop her Catarrh and Cough, and she said, she was Cured, by reason of the
great Ease she found.

4. As soon as I saw her, in Consultation with two other Physicians, I judged
her Disease to be a continual Fever, complicated with two double Tertians. As
for Remedies, that she was to be let Blood in her left Arm, seeing she had a
pricking Pain in her Left Side, with a very strong Fever, blackness of her
Tongue, and a continual Cough.

5. On the first therefore of May, about evening, she lost nine ounces of
Blood, and a cooling and thickning Jullep was given her; she passed the Night
with somewhat less trouble, the next day in the Morning, which was the second
of May, the Fever yet continuing strong, she was again let let Blood eight
ounces; whereupon her Fever was abated, and the Pain of her Side went away.

6. About the Evening the same day, she complained of a Pain in her right Side,
which growing still greater and greater, was very Sore about nine a Clock at
Night; wherefore we were compelled the same hour to let her Blood in her Arm on
the same Side; whereupon her Pain was abated, and in the Course of that Night
went quite away; howbeit the Night was troublesome; she was void of Sleep, and
did Cough almost continually.

7: Her Ague-fits went quite away; one, after a Purging Medicament the day
before I came to her; the other, by reason of her former Blood-letting: but her
continual Fever stuck by her after the same manner as formerly.

8. On the third day of the same Month; Seeing her Cough and Fever were
vehement, we gave her before Noon half the aforesaid Bolus, made of three
grains of Laudanum, which was ready made, which within an hour did stop her
Cough quite, and she was in a good Condition till Midnight; howbeit, her Cough
returned by fits, wherewith she voided thick, clammy and very putrid Phlegm; so
that much of her Spittle was yellow and green, the Fever continuing still very
violent.

9. And because in the Evening the Cough did exceedingly trouble her, and she
was extreme unquiet, the other half of the Bolus was given her, wherewith she
past the Night quietly, but slept very little.

10. On the fourth day in the Morning her Cough returned; but it was very free,
and she brought up much putrid Matter, some of which was a little sprinkled
with Blood. After two hours, her Cough ceased till Noon, and then it came again
bad enough, and when it had held her a great while and much afflicted her, her
Spittle appeared more crude, so that it seemed to come from a new Defluxion,
the half of another Bolus made of three grains of Laudanum was given her, with
which her Cough was again allayed.

11. Her Belly was loose in the Morning, and she had two Stools of many
Choleric and greenish Excrements, whereas before her Body was always bound,
and Clysters wrought very little. About Evening a Clyster was given her of a
Decoction of half an ounce of Sena, with Catholicon and Diaphoenicon, of each
one ounce; which gave her four Stools, and in her last Stool she voided much
Phlegm of a greenish Color, like that she was formerly wont to bring up by
Coughing.

12. After she had voided her Clyster, she slept quietly three hours, and said
she had not slept so sweetly all the time of her Sickness.

13. At ten a Clock-in the Night her Cough being somewhat returned, she took a
fourth part of the aforesaid Bole, which did not contain half a grain of
Laudanum, yet it stopped her Cough, and she rested quietly that Night.

14. On the fifth day in the Morning, she took a Purging Medicament, of half a
dram of Sena, infused in a Pectoral Decoction; wherein being strained, two
ounces of Manna were dissolved.

15. And the same day I left her, having seriously debated with her ordinary
Physician touching what was afterward to be done, and Committed the same to
Writing: Wherewith, in the space of twenty days after my Departure, she was
Restored to her former Health.

16. The chief of those Remedies were Pectoral Broths, continual Blood-letting,
and Purgation repeated. But the Bolus of Laudanum bore away the Bays, which
being given her many days in a small Dose, all the Symptoms were thereby
allayed. Riverius Cent. 3. Observe. 274.

XXIII. Fierce Catarrhs or Distillations with Sweat.

1. I have seen many troubled with cruel Distillations, who did Sweat so
exceedingly, that it brought them into an extreme Weakness, which I thus
suppressed.

2. Take Frankincense, Mastich, red Sanders, Kermes berries, red Rose-leaves,
of each one ounce: make them into a Powder, wherewith let the Patients
Head-Cloaths be smoaked. Riverius Cent. 4. Observe. 342.

XXIV. Of a Catarrh or distillation into diverse parts, with a diseased Spleen.

1. There was in a certain Noble Virgin Evident tokens of a Distilation, which
fell from her Head, especially the left Side thereof, into her Side, Lungs, and
Neck behind her Ears, and into her left Sholder-blade, and into sundry
inferior parts, with Wheazing, and shortness of Breath; which is a beginning
of the Phthissick.

2. Hereunto is added the Pain of her Stomach, which seems to proceed rather
from some fault of the Spleen than of it self. for I have a great suspicion of
that Bowel; though peradventure it may Communicate it is Illness to the Liver,
and be the original of the Infirmity of the Left side of her Head.

3. Her lest Hypochondrium must therefore be observed and felt.

4. The Cure of these Intertwisted Diseases must by Endeavored be frequent
Evacuations, which must sometimes be accommodated to the Head, sometimes to the
Bowels.

5. In the last quarter of the Moon before her Headache comes, let her Purge
with these Pills: Take of the Mass of Pil. Cochiae, one scruple: of Pil. sine
Quibus, two scruples: make five Pills.

6. For three or four Days after, her Head must be rubbed in the Morning with
Baggs of Millet, Salt, Anise, and Fennel-seed, fried in a frying pan: then also
the Rhume shall be drawn out at her Mouth and Nostrils, to Remove the
Threatening Distillation.

7. And afterward her Head must be dried and strengthened chiefly by outward
Applications and Fumes: and that humor which is already lodged in her Lungs
must be fetched out by Pectoral Medicaments, but especially with Syrup of Hyssop
and Maidenhair, sometimes by way of a Lick-pot, other whiles as a Julep being
mingled with a convenient Liquour, that so some Consideration may be had of
moving her Courses.

8. Also other Syrups pectoral may be prepared, which among other things, shall
contain the Roots of Elicampane, Polypody, Coltsfoot, Scabious, Hyssop,
Savory, with Dates, Figgs and Raisins.

9. The Narration of the foregoing Disease was written by Claudius Melinus,
desiring the advice of Fernelius in the following Words. A Virgin 23 years of
Age, low of stature, of a Compact and thick habit of Body, is vexed with these
Symptoms; for this five or six years, three or four days before the last
quarter of the Moon, she has an huge pain in her Head, both before and behind,
but chiefly on the left Side.

10. She feels also a very great Pain in her Stomach, when she Eats but a
little more than Ordinary, or when she Eats cold-Meat, vulgar Herbs, and moist
Meats. She wheezes in drawing her Breath, and is short winded in Cold and moist
Weather. She is Pained all her Body over, but especially that part, which
reaches from the lower part of her left Shoulder Blade to the top of her left
Dug.

11. She is vexed for want of Rest, nor does the morning bring her to Sleep:
she had once the Palm of her Hand all Scabbed, her Body is bound, and her
Mouthly purgations do not keep a Constant Course; For sometimes they come not
till three months are over, and sometimes after six Weeks, and that sparingly.
Ex* Consiliis Johannis Fernelij.

XXV. Of A Catarrh or Distillation with Melancholy.

1. This Gentleman is frequently troubled with a Distillation sometimes in his
Neck, otherwhiles into his Shoulders and Arms, sometimes into the hinder part
of his Back; but he is troubled with a more grievous Symptom than all these,
which is Hypocondrical Melancholy, For since the time he has been freed from
the Quartan Ague, he was taken with a pain in his left Hypocondrium, and has
ever since been so tormented with a Disease in his Spleen, that he was never
able to Lie on his left Side.

2. And from hence the Concoction of his Stomach is offended by way of
Contagion; his Appetite has been long time much dejected, he is much troubled
with Belchings, and much Spittle comes out of his Throat into his Mouth.

3. Hence also Fances and frightful Dreams, also Fear and Sadness, with a
Clownish kind of Bashfulness, always apt to Blush, and false and absurd
Imaginations of sad and Sorrowful things.

4. The Cure, Take Roots of Grass, Parsley, Fennel, Smallage, each half an
ounce: Bugloss, Borrage, Hops, Agrimony, Ceterach, Dodder, Adianthum or
Maidenhair, Hyssop, Origanum, each one handful: seeds of Endive, Dodder, and
of Musk-Melons, Liquorice shaved, each two drams: the Cordial flowers,
Epythymum, each one pugil; make a Decoction to fifteen ounces: in the strained
Liquor, infuse all night leaves of Sena cleansed, four ounces: white Agarick,
two ounces: Turbith bruised half an ounce: Ginger two drams: let them boil a
little in the morning, and make an expression, wherein dissolve one pound of
Sugar, and make a Syrup perfectly boiled.

5. Let him take once a week two ounces in Water, wherein Bugloss has been
boiled. And once a month, especially when the Moon is in the last quarter, to
purge away the matter of the Distillation, add to the aforesaid dose
Diaphenicon one dram and an half.

6. In the days between you shall strengthen all the principal Parts especially
the Spleen, with this Electuary: Take Powder of the Electuary laetificans
Galeni, shavings of Ivory, each one dram: powder of Diamargaritum frigidum, and
Tria-santalon, each half a dram: White Sugar dissolved in Bugloss-water, four
ounces: make all into Lozenges of three drams: a piece.

7. Take oil of Lillies, and of Capers, Mucilage, of Marshmallows drawn in
Bugloss water, each six drams: Wax a little, make them into a Liniment. Item,
Take Gum Ammoniacum dissolved in strong Vinegar one ounce: Artanita and Orrice
roots, each half an ounce: Plaster de Mucilaginibus and de Meliloto, each one
ounce: make all into a Plaster. But if the Disease shall stubbornly continue,
the inner vain of his left Arm must be opened, the next spring, if nothing
dissuade.

8. His Diet must be Ordered of good and thin Juice, which shall incline
somewhat to Coldness.

9. For all hot things, are therefore most contrary, because they Whet, this
same black Choler bred of yellow Choler over scorched, they set an Edge upon
it, by increasing the same also do raise more grievous Symtoms.

10. Let him therefore avoid all salt things, and peppered things, and Mustard,
and strong Wine and unmixed Wine: and let him Choose things of a contrary nature
to these, Johannes Fernelius his 45 Counsel.

XXVI. A fierce Catarrh, a sore Mouth, and Danger of a Phthisis.

1. A cetain Woman of Vrgen, was so vexed day and night all the long Winter
with a thin and sharp Distillation to her Breast, that being perpetually vexed
with Coughing and Hawking, she was forced to sit continually, nor would her
distillation give way to Evacuations, Revulsions and Diversions by
Cupping-Glasses.

2. Hence proceeded loss of Appetite, want of Sleep, Crudity of her Stomach,
which made her so lean, that she was in danger of a Consumption.

3. Wherefore the following Electuary having Reduced her to sleep, and a
Plaster being applied to the Coronal Suture of her Head, made of Ammoniacum,
Frankincense, Mastich, Nutmegs and Nigella seeds tosted; her Cough was allayed,
and her Appetite restored by little and little, so that she gained her former
Health.

4. Now the Opiate or Electuary, was thus made: Take old Conserve of Roses,
half an ounce: Diacodion with Sapa, two drams: Powder of Diatragacanthum, one
scruple: make thereof an Electuary, to be held betwixt the great Teeth and the
Cheeks when she lies down to Sleep.

5. And because this sharp Distillation raised Sores in her Mouth, for her Cure
she used this following Remedy by me prescribed: Take thistle Leaves, Woodbine
or Honey-suckle Leaves, of each one handful; whole Barley, one pugil: make of
all a Decoction to eight ounces: in the strained Liquour, dissolve Juice of
Pomegranates that are sweet-sower, two ounces: mix them.

6. With this Decoction she frequently washes her Mouth, and in a short space
of time, the Ulcers which did abound therein were healed, But a few days after
the Disease getting head a gain, I was forced to smear the Crust of the Ulcers
with Oil of Mercury, whereupon they soon fell away, nor did any sign of them
appear afterward. Riverius, Observe. 727.

XXVII. A Catarrh with a Disentery.

1. Mary Heath of Libington, Aged thirty four, being Cruelly vexed with a
Dysentery, Catarrh, Pain in the Back, Worms, casting out a thick stinking
matter by Urine, having been before fat, but now grown lean, was thus Cured:
Take Rhubarb powdered, one dram and an half: Syrup of Roses solutive, one
ounce: Borage water, three ounces: make a Potion. This was given in the morning.

2. Afterward this Clyster was cast in: Take the Decoction of torrifyed
Barley, one pound: Oil of Roses, three ounces: two yolks of Eggs: Red Sugar,
one ounce and an half: make a Clyster.

3. After the Clyster this was Exhibited: Take yellow Wax, half an ounce:
Crocus Martis, one dram: make of them a Ball like a Nutmeg, after put it into
the midst of an Apple, the Core taken out; then Roast the Apple under hot Ashes,
so that they may be melted into the substance of the Apple, and so Eat it
fasting.

4. Her drink was steeled, her Diet was Panados, made of French Barley dried,
and Crumbs of Bread, with steeled Water and Sugar; with these Remedies she was
perfectly Cured, I have also Cured many with Wax so prepared. Hall on English
Bodies, Cent. 1. Observe. 17.

XXVIII. A Catarrh with Pain of the Head.

1. One Mr. Randulph, Aged thirty five, troubled with Pain of the Head, great
Distillation and continual spitting, with Coldness of his Head, so that he was
Constrained to ware three Caps, was delivered from all in seven days by the
following.

2. He took the Emetick Infusion, one ounce: This gave him six Vomits and three
stools.

3. The next morning were taken the following Pills: Take pil. Cochiae, one
dram: Aureae, half a dram: Troches Alhandal, six grains: with Syrup Betony,
make seven Pills. Thus purged, there was taken away six ounces of Blood.

4. Afterward there was taken morning and evening one dram of the following
Powder: Take powder of Sena, six ounces: Rocket seed, half an ounce: long
Pepper, one dram and a half: make a powder thereof, and after the taking of it
seven days he grew well. Hall on English Bodies, Cent. 1. Observe. 25.

XXIX. A Catarrh, or distillation into the right Eye.

1. One Mris. Symmons of Whitelady-Aston was for a year afflicted with a
distillation of the right Eye, without Pain and Redness, by reason of which
there was a Diminution of sight: she was Cured by Me for fifteen years, by the
following Course.

2. For the removing the Watering of the Eye, this was used: Take Fumitory,
Sena, of each 3 drams: they were boiled in Whey for one draught, which was
often reiterated. After was used Pil. sine quibus. To the Neck was applied
Horstius's Vesicatory, which I have a long time used with great success, above
the Eye effected.

3. On the Temples, I appointed Emplastrum contra Rupturam, or in place of it
that prescribed of Bole in some former Observation. In the following Collyrium
were dipped two little Spunges, after wrung out and applied to the Eye, and there
bound till dry; it is most efficacious and approved.

4. Take Pomgranate Peels, one ounce: boil them in waters of R^ses, Plantain,
Night shade, each three ounces: in the straining dissolve Blood stone, two
drams: stir it till it be Red, after cast away the faeces, and add Myrrh, half
a dram: Sarcocol, washed in Milk, one dram: Ceruse, Tutia, each one dram: White
Vitriol, Starch, each one scruple: powder them all finely, and mix with the
liquor, to complete the Collyrium.

5. Tnere may be also prepared the Mucilage of the Seeds of Line and Fenugreek,
and when you would use the Collyrium, mix a little with it, or in want of
these, the White of an Egg: And thus she was happily Cured, Hall on English
Bodies, Cent. 1. Observe. 48.

XXX. A Catarrh complicated with other Diseases.

1. Diseases quite different and of various Kinds are met in a Body long
disposed to an evil H^bit: one is a Catarrh, or Distillation from a cold and
excrementitious Head, sometimes into the Jaw-bones, the Neck and
Shoulder-blades; at other times into the Lungs and lower parts, with a Cough
and shortness of Breath, which indicates a Phthisick.

2. Another is a Nephretick pain, afflicting by fits, proceeding from Gravel or
a small stone (although at present I see no sign of a stone bred, and sticking
in the left Kidney) which either alters and twitches the Kidney or portends
Nephritick pains at hand.

3. The third disease is an over great looseness of the Peritonaeum in the Right
Groin, or a tearing the same asunder by the force of Coughing, which menaces a
Rupture of the Guts, that Evil habit of Body which you gather from its swelling
and dull Color, has its original from the Impurity and Obstruction of the
Liver and Spleen.

4. Now Diseases so variously Complicated cannot be Cured without very great
care and Diligence; In the first place, Meats of a very good Juice must be
used, and the Patient must Eat Capers, young Hares, Partridges, small Birds,
Veal, and sometimes Mutton; and all these rather Roasted than Boiled.

5. Suppings, Broths, and much Drinking must be avoyed; also Figgs, and such
things as are of a bad Juice, Fullness, Surfeting and over much crudity. And
his Diet must be very moderate and drying, that by wasting the Superfluous
moisture, his Body may be dried and less subject to Distillations, Cachexy, and
other Diseases.

6. To this end moderate Exercises will very much Conduce, lest his Body
growing Dull by Ease and Idleness, should be oppressed with superfluous Humors;
the use also of Medicaments is necessary both to prevent and Cure the aforesaid
Infirmities.

7. And twice a month his Body must be purged with the following Syrup, which
is exactly accomodated to the Head, Liver and Lungs: Take Roots of Cicory,
Sorrel, Butchers Broom, Asparagus, and Parsley, of each half an ounce: Agrimony,
Endive, Dodder, Ceterach, Betony, Staechas, Hyssop, Coltsfoot, Burnet,
Saxifrage, of each one handful: Seeds of Endive, Dodder, Marshmallows,
Musk-melons, also Liquorice shaven, of each two drams: make a Decoction in a
sufficient quantity of water, for four doses to be taken as shall be said.

8. When there shall be more need of Purgation, and the distillation be over
Violent and the Body too heavy; if a slender Diet will not help, add to the
first dose two drams of Diaphaenicon.

9. That matter which is already got into the Lungs, in the intermediate days
free from purging must be washed out and cleansed by the frequent use of this
following Syrup, which is also very good for the Kidneys. Take Roots of
Elicampane, Polypody of the Oak, seeds of Carthamus, Raisins of the Sun, of
each half an ounce: Jujubes, Sebestens, fat Figs, four of each: Hyssop, Savory,
Coltsfoot Betony, Saxafrage, of each one handful; seeds of Marshmallows,
Cotton, Liquorice shaved, each three drams: make a Decoction to a pint and
half: in the strained Liquor, dissolve nine ounces of white Sugar, and four
ounces of the best Honey; make of all a syrup well boiled and aromatized with
Florentine Orrice, Cinnamon, of each two drams. Let him take thereof frequently
in a spoon in manner of a lick-pot, and sometimes mingled with Barley-water.

10. Item, Take of the Powder of Electuary, Diatragacanthum Frigdum, Dia^reos
simple, of each two drams; Aromaticum, Rosatum, one dram and a half: seeds of
Parsley of Macedonia, Saxafrage and Basil, each half a dram: White, Sugar
dissolved in Pellitory water, four ounces; make all into Lozenges or Tablets,
of two drams weight apiece. Let him sometimes eat a Lozenge in place of the
Syrup, a good time after meals.

11. The loseness of his Peritonaeum must, as he lies on Back, be fomented with
such a Decoction as this. Take Pisidia (an Earth so called from the place
whence it comes, in Virtue like fine Bole) Balaustins, Cypress-nuts, Gauls,
each an ounce: Alum, three ounces: boil them in Bean-water for a fomentation:
Then lay on the Rupture-plaster mixed with the former Pouders. Ex Consiliis
Fernelij.

XXXI. A Catarrh or Flux of Rhume into the Lungs.

1. I Understand by the Relation of a most Skilful Physician, that a
Gentelwoman about six and thirty years old, who had bore many Children, has
for these three years been troubled with a fluxion of Rhume into her Lungs,
which Causes her to Cough, and is like sometimes to Choke her, especially when
her Courses began to flow: which fluxion, though it have Continued long, yet
there is no Sign of her Lungs being corrupted, she not being fallen away in her
Body, nor is there any appearence of a Fever, nor is the digestive faculty
defective.

2. But it is now to be feared, lest humors putrefying or becoming more sharp
should exulcerate the Lungs, And that which is most of all troublesome, she
feels a perpetual Coldness in her Head, of which she vehemently complains.

3. Now to stop this defluxion many Learned Physicians have appointed several
Medicaments, whereby they have provided for the health of the whole Body, and
the parts affected viz. her Head and Lungs; yet there is no good done, the same
Symptoms continuing, which did before trouble her.

4. And therefore she desires Remedies from me, to stop that old defluxion of
Rhume into her Lungs, and to free her from these hazards she is subject unto.

5. Which that I may do it more conveniently, We must first Consider the Cause
thereof, which being Known may be opposed by proper Remedies. I Conceive the
principal Cause thereof to be a cold and moist Distemper of the Brain, which
from the Relics of its Aliment and the Vapors arising out of the lower parts
into the Head, does generate many Wheyish humors, which by the Energy of the
Brain, are driven out into the Lungs.

6. This Cause by chance may be assisted by a distemper of the Liver which is
over-hot, especially in a Body not enjoying the Benefit of transpiration, such
as is the Body of a very fat Woman, and the Lungs having a long time Received
this defluxion, they are thereby filled, and so a Periodical Phthissick is
caused by fits, which come at uncertain distances of time.

7. In the first place I conceive it very necessary that the humor Collected
in the Head be hindered from falling into the Lungs; and secondly, that what is
already gathered in the Lungs be brought up by the help of Medicines, with
Coughing and spiting.

8. And these endeavors may accomplished, if her whole Body be purged this
fall of the Leaf with Pills good for the Head, viz. Aggregative Pills, and sine
quibus, Agarick being added to them, which let her take twice a month, after
her first sleep.

9. But before the Pills are taken, her Body must be Purged with a Decoction of
Sena, made in a Pectoral Decoction, wherein Agarick and Rhubarb must be
infused, and an ounce of Syrup of Roses added to the strained Liquor.

10. To these you may add the frequent use of Clysters; and her Body being
Purged, open the Basilica Vein of her Right Arm, and take two small Porringers
of Blood.

11. And because the defluxion upon her Lungs proceeds from her Head, apply a
Cephalic Fomentation made of lie of Vine branches, wherein Orrice Root of
Florence, Calamus Aromaticus, Schenanth, Betony, Marjoram, Sage, with Sena
leaves are boiled, adding to the end of the Decoction a fourth part of Red
Wine* with this foment her Head in the morning, for the space of an hour; which
being dried, anoint it with Nard oil and Chemical oil of Turpentine, with a
little Aquae Vitae, a long time together, laying thereon Cotton Wool, filled
with powder of Florentine, Orrice, Marjoram and Sage.

12. Which if it do no good, and the Coldness continue, apply then the Plaster
de Betonica of the larger Composition, adding thereto Benjamin, Storax, Pitch,
and hot Cephalic Pouders, as of Orrice-root, Cypress-root, Marjoram, with a
little Tupentine, but the Hair must be first shaven off.

13. From these we must come to Cauteries, which must be applied to the top of
her Head, avoiding the Sutures: let her in the Winter continue her Cucufa and
Head Coverings. Let her Nostrils continue open, and if they happen to be
stopped, she must use first Liquid Errhins, then more strong ones, which are
not otherwise to be used in this sort of Disease.

14. To strengthen her Head make a Confect of Conserve of Rosemary-flowers,
Treacle, Methridate, preserved Citron peels, preserred Nutmegs: mix with
Conserve of Coltsfoot and B^rruge; and all made up with syrup of Staechas, in
the form of an Electuary.

15. And her Lungs, in whose wind pipes very much Phlegm is contained, must be
Cured with pectoral or Cough Decoctions, made of the Roots of Elicampane,
Florentine, Orrice, Dragons, with Betony, Hyssop, Savory, and other Cough
Medicaments. Also a Lohock must be provided of the Root of Aron or Cucko-pintle
and of dragons Roasted under the Embers, which being beaten, must be mixed with
the pulp of Sebestens, Jujubes, Raisons of the Sun, and Diatragacanthamum
Frigidum, all being made up into a Lick-pot with syrup of Maiden hair: let her
frequently take it from a Liquorice stick. The powder of Fox Lungs may be added
thereto. It will be also good for her to suck in the steam of a Pectoral
Decoction with open Mouth. Ex Consiliis Fernelij.

XXXII. A Catarrh with loss of Appetite.

1. The most Illustrious Lord, Lord William Compton, President of Wales, being
afflicted with a Distillation from the Head to the Gums; and also with lost
Appetite, I Cured as follows,

2. Take Sena well picked from the stalks, half an ounce: Rhubarb, two drams:
Agarick, one dram: Cinnamon, six drams: Infuse them all for twelve hours in
Borage and Succory water warm, of each ten ounces: in the Morning, they were
boiled to the wasting of four ounces: after being strained six or seven times,
and sweetened with four ounces of Sugar.

3. He took of this two ounces, when he went to Bed, with which in the Morning
he had a great stinking stool, that being the 21 of April* on the day following
in the Morning he took five ounces of the said Decoction, by which he had 8
stools,

4. The day after he took Pil. Aureae. de Rabarb, of each one dram: by which be
had 13 stools: After the third stool he began to be better, there being Broth
taken.

5. The Body being well Purged, the following Decoction was administered: take
China sliced two drams: Sassafras cut in thin round pieces half an ounce: Boil
them in eight pound of Water till half be wasted: of this he took four ounces
at the least, for eight days, every fourth day, taking two scruples of Pil.
Ruffi. And so was Cured. Hall on English Bodies, Cent. 1. Observe. 87.

XXXIII. A Catarrh variously observed,

1. The Author has given some Observations of Distillations on the Eyes, but
of none falling else where, that I can remember: Riverius in his third Century
affords us an Observation on himself, which happened November. 17. 1644. The
Wind being in the South, he was troubled with a Catarrh and hoarsness. The
second day of the Distemper, he kept his Bed, and took nothing, only twice of
an Hordeat at usual times of eating; the third day, he took a Laxative ptisan
with an ounce of Manna; the fourth day, he had some Ease and his Hoarsness was
much diminished; the fifth day, a dry Cough having seized him, he opened a
Vein; the sixth day, the Cough continuing, he took Calomelanos, one scuple,
with Refine of Jallap, eight grains. It did work slenderly till toward
Evening, and then it gave him two small Stools; the Cough being altogether
removed.

2. I Doubt not that they who have carefully read his Observations, may
observe, that his Calomelanos is Mercurius dulcis. This was my opinion, before
the last Impression of his Praxis Medic. And in that I think the Case is
incontravertably Resolved, if we compare his Observation concerning Worms, and
his Chapter about the same in his Praxis, only Remember, it must be six times
prepared.

3. The same Distemper, he Cured himself of, with twice taking Laudanum
Opiatum, the first time, three grains: the next time two grains: Cent. 3.
Observe. 69. only this is worth the notice in his Communicated Observe. viz. That
in most violent Catarrhs nothing stays sooner than this of Rulandus: Take Sharp
Leaven, two ounces: Amber levigated, two drams, make a Cataplasm: which is to
be applied to the Suture, the Hair being removed.

4. Thonerus tells us, That one being obnoxious to a Chronick Catarrh, other
things being ineffectual, was Cured by the following, drawn up into the Nose,
and the Decoction of Sassafras for drink: Take Tobacco leaves, with Oil of
Aniseed, one dram: Flowers of Marjoram, one Scruple: Musk, one grain: make a
Powder. Hall on English Bodies, Cent. 2. Observe. 85.

XXXIV. A Catarrh in a noble personage.

1. For the Cure of a Catarrh, by Dr. Prujean directed to a noble man: Take
Syrup of dried Roses, Jujubes Violets, and Diacodium, each two drams: Venice
Treacle, one dram: mix them: Of which take a Spoonful every night at the hour
of Sleep.

2. Take Liquorice Powder, and of Aniseeds, each one ounce: finest Sugar
dissolved in Mucilage of Gum dragon, drawn with Rose Water a sufficient
quantity, adding Confection of Alkermes, two drams: make them into Rolls, of
which hold often under the Tongue.

3. After which was prescribed a Limewater to Drink, which you have in my
Doron, and Dispensatory, the last Edition: Hall on English Bodies, Couns. 3.

XXXV. A Catarrh, and Uvula Fallen.

1. For a Right Honorable Lady, afflicted with a Catarrh and Relaxation of the
Uvula, by Doctor Willis, was prescribed the following Medicine: let her
Ladyship every morning Fume with the Smoke of Amber, first receiving it to her
whole Head, having a Canopy over it, and then take it into her Mouth with a
Funnel.

2. To the top of her Honors Head, being shaved, apply the next Plaster. Take
Betony plaster, half an ounce: Caranna, Tacamahacca, each two drams: mix them,
and let a plaster, of the bigness of the palm of the Hand spread on Leather, be
applied.

3. And as for a Powder to use to her Palate, Take long Pepper, Pomgranate
Peels, Sal Prunellae, each equal parts; which use with Uvula spoon.

4. If these Effect not a Cure, let her Ladyship take constantly a Diet --
drink made of Sassafras, China, Sanders, and Sarsaparilla; it is to be drunk
for a Week together.

5. For the Soreness of the Throat, Take leaves of Columbines, two handfuls:
white Pepper, one dram: boil them in Milk or Posset Drink, 2 pints; till half
be wasted, and make a Gargarism; wash the Throat, either with a syringe, or by
Gargling in the Throat, and cast it out again. Hall on English Bodies, Couns.

XXXVI. A Catarrh in a Scorbutic habit of Body.

1. The Right Honorable Robert Lord Brook, being Afflicted with a Scorbutic
Distillation, had prescribed, by Doctor Loss, the following Medicines: Take
Pil. de succino, Macri, Mastich, of each two scruples: Oil of Sassafras,
Nutmegs, Musk, of each one drop: mix them, and make twelve Pills: To take three
at Bed time, once or twice a Week.

2. Take Conserves of Roses, one ounce: preserved Nutmegs, one dram: Olibanum,
half a dram: Species Aromaticum Rosatum, two scruples: with a sufficient
quantity of syrup of Violets make an Electuary, to be taken the quantity of a
Nutmeg on those Nights the Pills are not taken.

3. But, instead thereof: Take Storax, half a scruple, formed in a Pill: take
Nutmegs and Gum Arabic, as much as you please, with Diacodium, and make small
Troches, to hold under the tongue at night.

4. Take seeds of Gromwell and Anise, each two ounces: Sea Salt, one ounce:
Gith seeds, two drams: make a powder; which put into a bag, with which being
warm, gently Rub the Head every Morning.

5. Take Gith seed, tie it in Sarsenet, and sprinkle it with Vinegar, to smell
to often; take Jujubes, one ounce: boil them in spring water to one pound: add
syrups of Violets and Coltsfoot, each one ounce and a half, Spirit of Sulphur,
six drops: of this take a good Draught every Morning.

6. Take Pulp of Marsh-Mallows-roots, half a dram: Species Diatragacanthum
frigidum, one dram: Liquorice, one scruple: Ambergrise, two grains:
Sugar Candy, three ounces: make Lozenges with the Mucilage of Gum-Dragon, to be
used often.

7. Take Coriander seed prepared half an ounce: seeds of Anise and sweet
fennel, each two drams: dried suckets, half an ounce: Candied Orange peels, two
drams: Tablets of Species Aromaticum Rosatum, half an ounce: Sugar three
ounces: make a gross powder, to be used after meals, a spoonful to help
Digestion. Hall on English bodies, Cons. 73.

XXXVII. Of a dangerous Suffocating Catarrh.

1. Mothers use to be very solicitous about the Cure of the Itch or Scab, which
breaks out sometimes in the Head, sometimes in the Neck. When Nature rather is
to be provoked to thrust out its Superfluities and Excrements this way to the
External parts.

2. As for the most part Children, if they are not cleansed by such Eruptions
in the Skin, are often suffocated, or obnoxious to some violent Disease, as the
following Example does make manifest.

3. The Son of that Noble person Johannes Rudolph ab Erbach, was never
Obnoxious to the Scab in the Head or about the Emunctories, and was of a
strong, lively and fat Body, yet did Breath with some difficulty, which his
Parents did Impute to the fatness and Phlegmatic Constitution of his Body.

4. About the thirteenth of July Anno 1608. a greater Catarrh or Distillation
fell down on his Chaps, and the Aspera Arteria. Although his Appetite was not
in the least diminished, and he Could duly perform all the actions and
exercises of his Body, yet his difficulty of Respiration was so much augmented
and a Distillation fell down in such abundance, that about the fourteenth of
July toward the evening there might be perceived some Snorting or Rattling of
the Nose and Throat, and grief about the Aspera Arteria.

5. He supped notwithstanding, and because his difficulty of breathing and the
Snorting or Rattling in his Nose and Throat was evidently increased, he sent a
Noble person to me that same night, to Receive my Advice, to whom I gave some
proper Medicines, and Returned home, but the Distillation was so great, that
every minute he was in hazard of Suffocation, and Could not use the Medicines I
had sent him.

6. Immediately that Noble person sent back one to Invite me to Come to him with
all possible Expedition, yet before I Could arrive at the place where this
youth was, he was suffocated, having Endured great torment, and departed the 15
of July. G. Fabr. Hildani, Cent. 3. Obs. 10. Exemp. 1.

XXXVIII. Another Suffocating Catarrh.

1. The Like Casualty happened to my Eldest Son, who although from the time he
was Born till he Entered the seventh year of his Age, he was not Obnoxious to
any Scab.

2. Yet a Catarrh did fall down in such abundance upon his Reins and Vreters,
that thereupon did follow a stoppage of his Urine, a great and continual pain,
and an Inflammation and Gangreen, of which he dyed the sixth day of his
sickness, G. Fabr. Hildani, Cent. 3. Obs. 10. Exemp. 2.

XXXIX. Another like suffocating Catarrh.

1. The Son of a certain Noble Person, who lived in Marchia, about the fourth
year of his Age, being grieviously troubled with the Scab and Itch throughout
his whole Body, chiefly in his Head and Emunctories, was carried to Cosma
Slotanus, an able and expert Physician.

2. But when I found the Gentleman was not Curable, neither by Lotion or
Unction, I declared, they had not followed the advice of Slotanus, but that
they had Committed the Cure of their Child to some Empyrick, who had indeed
Cured him of the Scab, but had thrown him into an Epilepsy.

3. Again, Slotanus his advice is required; first, he Purged his Body as much
as was convenient, and prescribed to him an orderly course of Diet; afterward
he Cured him of the Epilepsy, by applying things Inwardly, and about the
Coronal Suture.

4. Last of all, he applied Vesicatories, made of Bark of black Bryony, to the
Emunctories, which did attract the excrementitious humors to those places, and
so was perfectly healed of his Epilepsy, and as for the Scab it never troubled
him any more. Fabritius Hildanus, Cent. 3. Observe. 10. Exemp. 3.

XL. A Compendious Cure of a Catarrh upon the Breast.

1. In the year 1602. having after a heat contracted a Cold, I was suddenly
taken with a most vehement Catarrh, upon the external parts of my Breast, and
the Aspera Arteria.

2. This Catarrh had such an influence on the Muscles that help Respiration and
the Asperia Arteria, that I could not, but with great difficulty either Breath
or Speak; but very seasonably and before a Fever did take me, I gently purged
my self with the following Potion: Take Rhubarb the best, which comes from the
Indies, one dram: Cinnamon, new Agarick trochiscated, of each half a dram:
infuse them in a pectoral Decoction for a whole Night; in the Morning strain
out by expression, to which add Syrup of Roses solutive with Rhubarb, Agarick
and Sena, one ounce: Electuary diaphoenicon with Rhubarb, two drams: mix and
make a Potion, which gave about six or seven Stools.

3. The following Lozenges, I also continually held in my Mouth: Take the
species Diatragacanth frigid, and Diaireos, of each one dram: Powder of
Quince-seeds, one scruple: Flowers of Coltsfoot and Scabious, of each half a
scruple: with white Sugar, a sufficient quantity dissolved in scabious Water,
three ounces: make Tables or Lozenges.

4. The Breast, Belly, Shoulder-blades, and Neck, were twice a day anointed with
the following Liniment warm: Take Oils of Lillies, of sweet Almonds, Goose
Grease, Man's Fat, of each one ounce: Mucilage of Quince seeds (extracted with
Hyssop Water) one ounce and a half: Saffron in Powder, half a dram: mix, and
make a Liniment.

5. The next day, very early in the Morning, I took a dram of the Extract of
Carduus Ben. wrapped up in pure White Bread; which being swallowed, I drank
after it a little Cinnamon Water. This caused a great Ephidrosis, by which the
matter of the Catarrh, was in a great part carried off by Sweating; so that
immediately as it were, I felt through my whole Body the greatest ease and
comfort that might be.

6. The same day, I sweat three or four hours; then I observed a good order of
Diet, was daily anointed twice a day with the aforesaid Liniment, and kept
continually the even now prescribed Lozenges in my Mouth, by which means a few
days I became well, and through the divine Goodness was perfectly restored.

7. For eight days I used instead of Wine the following Decoction: Take
Agrimony, one handful: Paul's Betony, Oak of Jerusalem, of each half a handful:
Liquorice scraped, one ounce: boil in fair water, six pounds to the consumption
of a quarter part; strain, and sweeten it with clarified Honey and Sugar. I was
also cautious of receiv^ng the cold air. By this Method I afterward very
happily Cured many others. Fabritius Hildanus, Cent. 3. Observe. 41.

XLI. A Catarrh or Distillation upon the Eyes.

1. It is necessary the brain be well defended, because in all Distillations,
it sends the Humors down upon the Eyes, and the Eyes receive them, and lest
peccant Humors be bred, in the brain and Head, and fall down on the Ey^s; these
Humors are to be drawn down to the less Noble parts.

2. The Eyes and Sight, that have been for a long time weakened with the
Catarrh, are to be strengthened, to preserve them from the defluxion. All this
may be excellently done by Diet, Purgations and Medicines, strengthening both
Head and Stomach, and at last by things Topical.

3. In Diet, a temperate Air is to be made choice of; for a hot Air dissolves
the Humors in the Head, and renders them thin and sharp; a cold Air shuts up
the Pores and hinders an Exhalation, and having nipt and suppressed the Brain,
causes violent Defluxions.

4. As a Sponge squeezed betwixt the Hands, violently Spits out the Water, so
out of the brain, nipt with Cold, break forth excrementitious Humors.

5. In eating and drinking all excess is to be avoided, the quality and
convenient use is to be observed, according to the Nature of Predominant
Humors, let the Belly be always kept in a good Temper; if it be not so
naturally, let it be done by Suppositories, Clysters, or stewed Prunes, with
the Infusion of Sena, Rhubarb, Agarick, a decoction of Agrimony, Fluelin,
Betony, and Eyebright.

6. Frequent violent Purgations, being not so good by reason of your Age, I
rather approve and allow Purgations to be taken at Spring and Fall, or at any
other time when there is occasion, as Pilulae Lucis Majoris, Cochiae, Aureae;
or, The Infusion of Sena, Rhubarb, and Agarick.

7. Great Care must be taken also of the Stomach because of its Sympathy with
the Head, a weak Stomach sends many Vapors to the Head, which being converted
into Humors, soon descends upon the Ey^s.

8. Therefore there must be an abstinence from any thing that oppresses and
breeds Vapors in the Stomach.

9. Let it also be strengthened with Electuaries, or some Concoctive Powder;
the Elevation of the Vapors to the Head is much checked by taking Marmalade of
Quinces, without the Species or old Conserve of Roses.

10. And I do approve greatly of the following Powder: Take of white Bread
toasted, two ounces: the pulp of dried Quinces: the Internal Skin of the
Gizzard of a Hen, one ounce: Coriander prepared, Cinnamon Fennel seed, of each
two drams: Flowers of Betony, Rosemary, Sage, the summities of Marjoram,
Eyebright, of each two pugils: Sugar to the weight of all: mix them and make a
Powder, of which take a spoonful after feeding, and in the Morning, or with a
sufficient quantity of clarified Honey, make an Electuary, of which you may
take to the quantity of a Chestnut.

11. Such kind of Catarrhs have usually for a Concomitant a distempered Liver,
even as from the heat under a Still, Vapors are carried up to a great height,
so from a hot Liver, Vapors are carried out of the Stomach to the Head; but if
there be any such Distemper, it may be allayed by keeping a good Diet, and by
taking Diarrhodon Abbatis, and the Ointment of Sanders.

12. Great care is to be taken in Topics, least things too Cold be applied (as
is too commonly done) to abate the Inflammation of the Eye; the frequent use of
such does condense the Visive Spirit, the Humors of the Eyes and the Cornea;
and thence proceeds the Dullness of the Sight.

13. Therefore so long as the Pain and Inflammation of the Eyes continue, apply
the Milk of a Woman newly drawn from her Breasts, in which let there be put
some whole Saffron and macerated, and Tutia prepared, and burnt Hartshorn
prepared: and let there be dipped therein a double Cloth, and then lay it warm
to the Eyes, and so often repeat as there shall be occasion.

14. The following Cataplasm will abate the Pain and drive away the
Inflammation: Take the Cr^m bread, of white Bread, half a pound: the powder of
the seeds of Faenugreek and Quinces, of each half an ounce: and so boil them in
Cows-milk to the Consistency of a Cataplasm, afterward mix 2 yolks of new laid
Eggs, and one scruple of Saffron, and apply it warm.

15. Or let the Eyes be suppled with the following Anodyn Decoction: Take of
the roots and leaves of Mallow, Flowers of Melilot, of each one handful: the
seeds of Faenugreek, and Line-seeds of each half an ounce: let them be boiled
in water for a fomentation.

16. But if the distillation prove vehement, let the body be purged instantly;
apply also somewhat that shall be useful, to the Forehead and Jugular Veins,
to stop the defluxion, and Cupping-glasses with a flame, as also Scarification
on the Shoulder Blade, and a Vesicatory behind the Ears, but let the body be
first purged as is prescribed before.

17. You may use a Masticatory, fasting, that the matter which falls down on
the Eyes may be by little and little drawn off: Take of Mastich, the roots of
Pyrethrum, the tops of Marjoram, Nutmegs, of each one dram: Oil of Fennel half
a scruple: with Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth make Troches, the bigness of a
Lupine.

18. Things that cause Sneezing in Diseases of the Eyes I do no ways approve
of, For by drawing the humors to the Nostrills, they fill the Optic Nerves,
they weaken the sight, as does appear in my Chyrurgical observations.

19. In men given to study, the Brain by reason of Vapors, is to be comforted
and strengthened; and that strengthening of the Brain is done if a good diet,
gentle purgations, and moderate diversions be observed.

20. But as concerning diet and purgations, we have treated of them formerly,
now as to things externally applied, the following powder is to be sprinkled
upon the Head, or Cap of Spices is to be made: Take leaves of Rosmary, Sage,
Staechas, Red Roses, the tops of Marjoram, of each half an handful; the seed
of Coriander, one dram: the wood of Aloes, Mastick, Frankincense, Diamoschi
dulcis, styrax Calamita, Nutmegs, grains of Kermes, of each half a dram: let
them be cut and bruised according to Art. Being taken Inwardly, the following
strengthen the Brain and sight: so also the Conserve of the flowers of Betony,
Eyebright, Rosemary, Sage, Peony, the tops of Marjoram, and the seeds of
Fennel not yet ripe. Experience teaches, That Eyebright what ever way taken,
is good for the Eyes.

21. The following strengthens and clears the sight, fennel water, the water of
Rue, Eyebright, Celandine the greater, and the purple flower of Pimpernel.

22. But while the distillation Continues, these Medicines must be continued,
that thereby it may be diverted, and a better and surer way of Diverting those
humors, cannot be found, than by Issues and the Seton.

23. If after all this the heat of ths Liver is excessive, apply a Corrosive or
Cautery under the right Knee, between the fourth and fifth Muscle that moves
the Thigh with the Joining of the Fibula near the Tibia about three Inches
distance from the former; that thence an Issue may be made, that does draw the
noxious humors from the Liver, for by that part comes a great branch of the
hollow Vein.

24. If these things be rightly administered and the Seton and Issue kept open,
by Gods goodness great fruit will be reaped thereby, the Catarrh not only,
which continually falls down on the Eyes, shall be evacuated by the parts less
noble, but the pain and redness of the Eyes abated, and the sight rendered
clearer. Fabricius Hildanus, Cent. Epist. 56.

XLII. A Catarrh falling upon the Breast and Lungs.

1. Being invited to visit a certain Noble Person, who was dangerously sick, I
chanced to meet with very tempestous Weather and an unpleasant Air in my
Journey, which was the unhappy cause of a Catarrh falling upon my Breast, at
first it did not appear to be grievous.

2. I purged my Head with Pills for the Head, because I was afflicted with the
Headache; I kept a good course for my Diet; I was abstemious from wine, I took
Pectorals; also my Breast with Oils and Ointments I anointed.

3. But my Cough was so increased and so very Vehement, that I did Exspect
nothing else but that the vessels of my Lungs and Caul would be broken, yea
sudden Death; It is almost Incredible, how much tough ugly phlegm I disgorg'd, I
know that for the space of four and twenty hours I Vomited some pounds.

4. A Fever (which through the whole disease was weak) could scarsly be
discerned by my pulse. My Appetite was indeed impaired, but not destroyed
altogether, However to preserve my Strength, I made choice of the delicatest
and safest Meats.

5. Yet my Cough with a violent pain in my Head from day to day increased, all
the Muscles of the Breast and Paunch about twelve of the Clock at night, being
the 25 of December, were wonderfully shaken with the extreme violence of
Coughing, a great pain seized me about the left Groin, and not more than an
hour after about the long Ribbs, it was so painful that I could scarcely Breath
for half an hour; and by reason of the violence of the Pain, as well of my
Breast, as my Caul, I could not Vomit up the matter which was gathered in the
Aspera Arteria.

6. My Friends applied to me sweet-bags of mollifying and laxative Roots,
Herbs, flowers and seeds sodden in water, as also Expectorating syrups, where
with the matter fallen down to the External Muscles of the Breast and Caul, was
dissipated.

7. The Pain being somewhat assuaged, I began to Cast out that clammy Phlegm,
that lay on the Aspera Arteria, and so the Pain I had of Respiration was by
little and little remitted; and in the Morning I had a pleasant and refreshing
Sleep, with a fine breathing Sweat, by the benefit of which the greater part of
the matter which was fallen upon the pectoral Muscles and the Abdomen was
dissipated.

8. That suffocating Catarrh did diverse times return, but much milder, and
always in unequal days, having observed a good Diet, and Sweet-baggs, Oils and
Unguents and all other things that were requisite, being Carefully administered,
that Cruel Coughing, by little and little vanished.

9. But take notice of a new and rare Symptom, that for a whole Month I was
afflicted frequently by Coughing, or by Yawning, Respiration was intercepted
even to some strokes of the Pulse; presently I felt a cold Air seize my Breast,
after which suddenly followed a Faintness: wherefore I was careful to avoid
more vehement Exspirations, by Coughing and Yawning.

10. Often times when the tough, Clammy matter fell down on the top of my
Weasand, I would have gladly Vomited, especially when I was awakned from Sleep;
but could not, being in danger of suffocation. Besides that the viscid, tough
matter did stick to some part, and even by Hawking I could scarsly be rid of
it, a cold Wind by reason of frequent Gaping, did with some Impetuosity come
upon my Lungs, and then a Faintness.

11. The Cause of this symptom, I conceived to be in the Larynx, or
Throat-flap, which was so wasted with the violence of the Cough, that it could
not perform its office readily in shuting and opening the Aspera Arteria, and
it is most likely, the reason is, that when the Larynx, or Throat-flap is
opened either by Coughing, Breathing, or Yawning, it is not so readily shut
again, because the cold Air comes to the Lungs with some Kind of Impetuosity,
and affects the Vital Spirits, and Destroys the strength.

12. From thence I Concluded, that the symptom would be more mild, and a less
decay of the strength would follow, if the Mouth were covered with some hot
Cloth, or with the Palm of the Hand, and by that means a warm Air would be
drawn in by Coughing, or Yawning or Breathing: some other Medicines being
applied, that symptom was also removed and so I grew well. Fabritius Hildanus
Cent. 6. Observe. 8.

XLIII. Another Catarrh hindering Swaling.

1. There was one that could not Swallow down either meat or drink, without
danger of suffocation, that happened to him by reason of a Catarrh upon the
Larynx, which made the Epigolottis or Throat-flap open.

2. Through the weight of the Meat it was depressed easily, when on the
contrary Liquid things did fall upon the Aspera Arteria. Fabritius Hildanus,
Cent 6. Observe. 8.

XLIV. A Catarrh in an Idle Monk.

1. Seeing it is most usual that Catarrhs proceed from a great Weakness, or
from the bad temper of the Brain, which is cold and moist, it chiefly happens
when the Nourishment transmited to the Brain, is not well digested, from whence
superfluous humors are gathered and an abundance of excrements.

2. The Medulla of the Brain needs good store of aliment, from whence
necessarily follows that there must be also much Excrements, but principally if
it be cold and moist or made weak, by any other Cause, or if too great a plenty
or to small a quantity of nourishment be taken.

3. If a Monk of the order of the Carthusians, be a Eater of Fish, of a pale
color, Phlegmatic, of a weak Head, having a Brain, cold and moist, using a
Diet cold and moist, always staying within his Grates, Idle, and without any
kind of Exercise, the Winter being Rainy, Tempestuous, Snowy, of a dark
Complexion, and he should be troubled with a Catarrh, and invite me to be the
Physician of that Monastery: in order to his Cure, if I could not prevail with
this fish-devouring Monk to Change his Diet, I would advise him to eat Roasted
fish, seasoned with Pepper, and Spice, rather than boiled.

4. Seeing he must not touch flesh-meat, I would also Order him to abstain from
Food that Causes many Vapors, as onions, garlic, mustard, and the like; for
Drink let him use the Decoct^on of Liquorice with a little Cinnamon, being in
the lieu of Wine; so much the more as that a small Cough did accompany it.

5. Then for diminishing of the material Cause, I order him to take the Pills
following. Pilulae Aloephanginae, Pills of Hiera simplex, powder of Mastich, of
each one scruple: with Betony water make seven pills.

6. Presently after I prescribe this digesting Syrup, or mixture. Take Honey of
Roses strained, syrups of Betony, of Liquorice, syrup of Colts foot, of each an
ounce and half: waters of Hyssop, Sage and Betony, of each three ounces: mix
for three Doses. Afterward to take these Pills for the more absolute
eradication of the matter: Take Pilulae Cochiae de Agarico, of each a scruple
and half: with Betony water, make seven Pills; let them be given after midnight.

7. The Head I purge by the Nostrils with moist or Liquid Errhines, made of
Juice of Beets and sweet Majoram mixed with a little Honey.

8. Moreover, I command him at going to Bed to Swallow three, four, or five
grains of pure Olibanum (in my opinion fifteen or twenty grains of Olibanum
would have been much better.) Also this Cucupha or Quilted Cap, made of the
following mixture, to be applied to the Coronal Sutures, which strengthens the
Head, and causes a Suspension of the Catarrh: Take Olibanum, Frankincense,
Mastick, Gum of Juniper, of each half a dram: Roses, one pugil: Cloves, one
scruple: Sage and Betony, both dry, of each half a pugil: cut and bruise all,
and make a quilt in form of a Cap, according to Art: the which was orderly
performed. Petrus Forrestus, lib 10. Observe, 28.

XLV. A Catarrh from gross cold Matter, with a Cough and a pain of the Head and
Breast.

1. This Gentleman was so much afflicted with a Cough and Catarrh upon the
Breast of Phlegmy thick matter, that he with difficulty Breathed, he was also
grievously troubled with the Headache and an Obstruction of the passage of the
Nostrils, of which he was Cured by these following Medicines.

2. Take Betony, Marjoram, Calamint, Origanum, of each one handful:
Maidenhair, Hysop, Scabious, of each half a handful: Coltsfoot, half a
handful: seeds of Caraway, parsley, wild Carot, Bishops-weed, of each one
dram: Prunes, Damask or Spanish, that are ripe to a sweetness, one quarter of a
pound: Figgs that are fat, to the number of three: Raisons of the Sun, cleansed
from their stones, one handful: Barley cleansed, one pugil: Dates stoned to
the number of three: the leaves of Sena, one ounce: boil them all in three
pound of water, till it come to one pound and an half: strain it, and then add
two ounces of syrup of Liquorice and Hyssop, of each a like quantity; mix them.
Let him take thereof about two ounces twice a day, one in the Morning, and
another at four of the Clock in the Afternoon, and it will give two or three
stools twice or thrice a day.

3. Afterward he was Purged with the following. Take pills of Agarick, two
scruples: pil. Cochiae, one scruple: with the water of Betony* make seven
Pills: let them be taken after midnight.

4. And as for his Cough, let him use this Electuary: Take of the pineapple,
Maceraced in hot water, afterward bruised three drams: also pil. Bechiae, one
dram: Sugar penidies and sugar Candy, of each two drams: Lohoch of Pine-nuts
half an ounce: Juice of Liquorice two drams: syrup of Liquorice, Hysop,
Maidenhair, of of each one ounce: mix them.

5. The Head was also Purged with liquid Errhins, which brought the matter down
to the Nostrills; but I caused him to forbear Masticatorys, and Gargarisms: for
the Pain of the Head, the Forehead and Temples were anointed with the Ointment
of Alablaster, and the Pain was diverted by Frictions.

6. At last the Catarrh was removed, and the rest of the Symptoms by the
following Prescription: Take the species Diacinamomi, half a dram: species
Diarrhodon Abbatis, Aromaticum rosatum, of each two scruples: species Diaireos
Salomonis, one scruple and an half: mix them and with Betony Water, in which
white Sugar three ounces is dissolved make a Confection for Rouls, weighing
each three drams: and then let there be taken one every Morning. Petrus
Forestus lib. 10. Observe. 130.

XLVI. A Catarrh proceeding from sharp and salt Matter.

1. There was a certain Youth, who was troubled with a distillation, his Head
was somewhat hot, and a sharp, thin and salt humor did fall down by his Mouth
and Nostrills, with a Cough, whereby there was danger of the Ulceration of his
Lungs, or of a Phthisick, or of a Squincy.

2. His Face and Nose was red (for he was too great a Lover of Wine) and having
been satisfied of his present temper, I first ordered the opening of a Vein,
then the following syrup was prescribed: Take syrup of Violets, of Water
Lillies, of Poppies, of each one ounce: decoction of cleansed Barley,
Liquorish, and the four greater cold seeds, six ounces for twice.

3. Then he was thus Purged: Take syrup of the Infusion of Damask Roses with
Rhubarb one ounce and an half: water of Endive, Cichory, of each an ounce and
an half: Electuary lenitive, pulp of Tamarinds new drawn out, with the water of
Endive, of each one dram. The syrup of Damask Roses Infused was made with
Rhubarb, in every ounce was infused one dram of Rhubarb; by which he was Purged.

4. At night he used a Barley Drink made thus: Take Barley cleansed, one pugil:
sweet Almonds, one ounce and a half: seed of white Poppy, one dram and an half:
the four greater cold seeds hull'd, of each one scruple: let it be done
according to Art.

5. Sometimes, when he goes to Bed, let him take a little Diacodium, or the
syrup of Poppy-tops, and water, and by little and little swallow it down. He
may take this Liquor in lieu of a Gargarism, to stop the fluxion or
distillation: Take the flowers of red Roses, one pugil: the outward Skin or
peel of white poppy heads, and one or two Buds thereof: Jujubes new, one pugil:
boil in running water to one pound: and when strained, add the syrup of poppys,
two ounces and a half: Diamorum, half an ounce: Bole Armoniack, one dram and a
half: mix them.

6. Presently he may hold these Pills in his Mouth: Take Bole Armoniack, washed
with Rose water, Terra sigillata well washed with decoction of Poppy-buds, of
each one dram: the species Diatragacanthi frigidi, four scruples: Almonds, Gum
Tragacanthum, of each two scruples; and so dissolve them with the white of an
Egg, the syrup of Poppy being added: let the Pills be as big as Lupins to be
held under the Tongue.

7. In the mean time let him use to lick the follow^ng, to stop the Catarrh:
Take Lohoch of Poppy, one ounce: Diatragacanthum frigidum, three drams: syrup
of poppies, one ounce and a half: syrup of Jujubes, one ounce: mix them.

8. He put this often into his Mouth, swallowing it down by little and little:
Take Conserve of Roses, one ounce: the Powder of the species Diatragacanthi
frigidi, three scruples: Diacodium; 3 drams: syrup of dry Roses and Poppy, of
each a sufficient quantity; mix and make an Electuary.

9. We used sometimes diversity of things, as the washing of the Arms, and other
extreme parts with a Decoction in water of the flowers of Water Lillys,
Willows, the heads of white Poppy, and the flowers of Chamomil.

10. Likewise diversity of Frictions was used as anointing the Head and Temples
to dispose the Patient to Sleep, with the Oil of Water Lillyes, Poppy, and the
Ointment of poppular Buds.

11. And sometimes a Powder was sprinkled on the Head, which was constringent
and strengthening, after this manner: Take Sanders, half a dram:
Myrtle-berries, one dram: Coriander seed prepared, one dram: the flowers of red
Roses, half a pugil: and a little of the flowers of Water Lilles, the Head
being in part shaven, Sprinkle this Powder thereon.

12. By these Medicines he was Cured, he abstaining for a while from Wine,
Spice and all other things, which would Inflame or provoke the Cough. Petrus
Forestus: lib: 10. Observe. 131.

XLVII. A Catarrh with a Pain it the Head

1. A certain Gentleman at Delf was taken with a Catarrh and a Pain of the
Head, whom I Physickt after this manner: Take Diacatholicon, Diaphenicon, of
each three drams: Confectio Hamech, two drams: dissolve in the waters of
Betony, Borrage, Cichory, of each one ounce: syrup of Betony, one ounce: mix
them.

2. Afterward using a Decoction of Sarsa parilla he was Eased of his vehement
distillation and Pain of the Head.

3. When he Complaind of a weak Stomach, I anointed him with the Oil of Mace
after which he found himself pretty Well. Forestus lib. 10. Observe. 132.

XLVIII. Another Catarrh with an Extreme Pain of the Head.

1. Another person, of a Phlegmatic Constitution, was afflicted with an
extreme violent Pain of the Head and a Catarrh, which fell down upon the
Muscles of the Cheek-bone, after which was a swelling sowewhat hard and red.

2. But a diet being prescribed him, The matter was much lessened by the
following Pills: Take pil. de hiera, two scruples: Agarick trochiscated, one
scruple, with the syrup of staechas, make five Pills, and take them two hours
after supper.

3. And to prepare the pituitous and phlegmatic humor, Take simple oxymel,
syrup of Staechas of each one ounce and half: the Waters of Betony, Fennel and
Marjoram, of each two ounces: mix them and make 2 doses of them.

4. Then as for purging let him take pil. de cochia, Agarick, de hiera, of each
one scruple: Diagridum, two grains: with the syrup of Staechas, make of them
five Pills, and take them after midnight.

5. Again the matter being more Prepared and Concocted, he was purged once more
with Pills of Cochy, and his Head anointed with the Ointment of Alabaster to
remove the Pain thereof, and his Cheek bone, which was swelled, with the Oil of
Lillies.

6. Afterward for great Resolution and loosening of the matter, there was
added the Oil of Cammomil, by these he was Cured and not put to the necessity
of Errhins, or other Topic remedies. Petrus Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 132.

XLIX. A Catarrh proceeding from Cold, causing a Pain of the Ears and Teeth.

1. The Pain of the Ears proceed not only from a bare Distemper, but for the
most part from some compounded or conjunct matter, and that chiefly Cold, and
is known by a distillation from the Head, when after the South wind has filled
the Head, the North wind suddenly blows.

2. For two Reasons it hurts, and excites Pain: first by reason of the
Distemper, which joins with the other affect; but much more, when by its own
proper power it distends the sensible parts; and again most of all when the
flatuous Spirit Elevated by it, does extend and disturb the Membrane and
internal nervous parts thereof.

3. A certain Woman of a pale Color, and a Phlegmatic Constistution, the Air
being Cold, and the South wind blowing, and great Rain following, fell into a
Catarrh, which did trouble the lower parts and fill her Head with phlegm.

4. She used a moist and phlemy kind of Diet before, and for two whole Weeks
she was afflicted with a violent Pain in her left Ear, besides a distillation
upon her Teeth of the same side, and a swelling somewhat hard without any
redness in her Cheek-bone, by which great Pain of her Teeth, and inwardly in
her Ear, in the auditory passage, she could neither Eat or Sleep.

5. I then Concluded that this did proceed from a Cold distillation of Cold
matter, and therefore purgation would be necessary.

6. After the syrup of Betony and Oxymel was given, she was purged with the
following Pills: Take Pil. Cochiae, assajaeret, and de Hiera, of each one
scruple: with the water of Betony, make five Pills, and let them be taken after
Midnight, which gave her two or three stools.

7. Afterward, Diet which was slender and attenuating was prescribed her: and
in the place of Wine and Bear, Metheglin, wherein Cinnamon was boiled.

8. Then Pills of Cochy was administered, and Cupping-glasses with
scarification, on the Shoulders, and having purged both the Head and Body, I
made use of Errhines and Masticatories, which properly cleanse the Head.

9. After the Pills and Cupping-glasses, I made use of others Topics, to wit,
Oils and Pultisses, which assuage the Pain of the Head, but because they did
not help enough, I did apply a Plaster to the Ear, which did wonderfully ease
her.

10. Take a large Red Onion roasted under hot ashes, Oil of Camomil, one ounce;
Oil of Aniseed, fresh Butter, of each half an ounce: Saffron, one scruple: make
it in the Mortar like to the form of a plaster, and apply it warm to the Ear,
day and night, and it will take away the Pain of the Ear, and lose the Apostem;
this will do though it comes first to a suppuration, or festering. Petrus
Forestus, lib. 11. Observe. 5.

L. A Catarrh by consent of the inferior Parts.

1. Physicians Refer the principal cause of a Catarrh to the Liver, but why the
vapors that are hot and moist ascend to the Brain from the Liver by the
Stomach rather then by the Veins to the Head, I know no Cause, neither shall I
raise any Controversy about it; For it is agreed it may be by either of the
ways.

2. But if the Cause proceed from the lower parts, the distemper must be
removed from them; if the Head be Infirm, it must be strengthened, and that
Consists in restoring the Temperament.

3. After meat, let such things be taken as may Check the Vapors from
ascending: as the Concoctive Powder of Sylvius; and the prepared seeds of
Coriander; the Confection or Marmalade of Quinces without the Spices, to this
may be added Sugar of Roses with Bole Armoniack.

4. I do not approve of evacuations in pectoral Diseases, from a Catarrh it is
more safe to forbear in such Diseases of the Breast and Lungs, the use of
purgative Medicines.

5. Pills of Aloes washed with juice of Roses, are a drying and strengthening
Medicine: Manna with the syrup of Roses draw away those Wheyish Humors.

6. If the cause of the Catarrh depend on the bad disposition of the Liver and
Stomach the Spaw waters heal both: I doubt not their usefullness.

7. But in my judgment the Distemper of the Head is chiefly the thing from
whence these Symptoms proceed, which are carefully to be looked after, in order
to their Cure: the Spaw-waters how much they avail in reference to this: I know
not; they cannot hurt: the Bathings are approved according to the diversity of
the matter of the Catarrh.

8. If by these the heat of the Liver is to be assuaged, why do we not rather
apply Pultises? We do not think our Wormwood to be cold; and seeing siccity
makes Calidity and Roses that are mixed, do dry, how far is this Medicament
profitable?

9. Also after Bathing in sweet-water, or rather Oil in which is boiled a
little quantity of Sanders, Roses, and Wormwood, I would bath the region of the
Liver with Wine in a double Vessel.

10, Oils dry less: what Bathings help, does appear, in that the matter of the
Catarrh is by these mingled and diffused throughout the whole Body; and is
derived from the Breast.

11. But unless I am greatly mistaken, we must chiefly look to the Distemper
which is in the Head: therefore there must be applied to the Head sweet-bags of
Roses and sanders, with which must be mixed a little of the powder of Amber,
Mastick, Mace and Clove-gilly-flowers, making thereof as it were a Cap.

12. At night, let him hold in his Mouth a little of a Nutmeg toasted; in the
morning take a few Caraways to beat down those gross Spirits which being
agitated, Cause a giddiness or Megrim.

13. Let him use Pomanders Confected with the Oil of Caraway, Aniseed and
Fennel seed, and let him make a perfume of Gum Storax: let him also use in the
morning frictions, and Washing of the Feet; in all which there is great help to
be had, and this may be done in Winter.

14. Great Care is to be taken of the persons Diet: his Head, Feet and Breast,
are to be well defended against the Cold: the matter which is gathered in the
Breast and Lungs is to be purged out by Coughing or Hawking, not by Medicines
that purge the lower parts.

15. And the Breast is to be strengthened by those things that are not only
externally but also internally to be applied, as Bole Armoniack, and in the
Winter, also Treacle with Conserve of Roses. Laurentius Scholzius: ex Cratone
Cons. 4.

LI. A Catarrh from various Causes.

1. The most simple Medicaments are the best, therefore this simple Electuary
which strengthens both the Head and Stomach I approve of: Take Conserve of
Borrage, Citron peels condited, of each half an ounce: Conserve of Roses, four
ounces: Species Aromaticum Rosatum, one dram and an half: Cloves cut, one dram:
mix them, and take thereof in the morning to the quantity of a Chestnut.

2. About bed time let him take for stopping the defluxion, the following
Electuary: Take conserve of Roses, one ounce: Male frankincense, two scruples:
Nutmegs toasted, one scruple: Species Aromaticum Rosatum, half a scruple: mix
them and make an Electuary.

3. If the Liver is to be strengthened, take of this Confection two rouls at a
time which may gently purge the Belly: Take sugar dissolved in Cinnamon water,
four ounces: Rhubarb subtly pulveris'd, two drams: of the extract of Rhubarb,
half a dram: mix them, and let there be a Confection made in little Rouls.

4. Washing of the Head is good to those who are troubled with Rhume: But I
approve most of simple things, and think it will be enough, if Marjoram and Red
roses be put in lie of ashes; sweats in the Morning will do well, especially if
you take of the Juice of Carduus, Laurentius Scholzius Ex Cratone Cons. 5.

.LII. A Catarrh with a Pain of the Stomach.

1. As to the Catarrh, the Pain of the Stomach, loss of Appetite, the swelling
of the Belly, the Pains of the Neck, and the tumor of the Groin, they have all
their original from Rhume.

2. And this Rhume or Phlegm does proceed from these Causes, the heat of the
Stomach languishes and is weak, nor is it revived with daily Exercise, and the
said heat is drawn often from the Stomach to assist the Head in its
Contemplations, studys, profound Cogitations, etc.

3. When the Pot of it self is infirm, and a fire is put to it, which has more
of smoke than flame, and the flame is not raised by the Bellows, and the
burning Coals are taken away from it, and sent to dress other things; what does
follow but that there can be nothing made Ready.

4. So when there is not sufficient heat for Concoction, nor the flames of that
heat blown up by the Bellows of Exercise, there cannot be in the shop of the
first Concoction any good Digestion of the meats in the Stomach.

5. And moreover that which is set to boil, if it want a Convenient fire, must
needs remain Raw, and so it is with meats, if they want a convenient heat to
Concoct them in the Stomach, they presently turn into a thick, Clammy and
viscid humidity and beget Crudities; and from thence is so great an abundance
of Excrementious humidities.

6. In the Body, the Concoctive and digestive faculty is not so exact, but that
there is left some thing superfluous, by the accession of which the pituitous
and Rhematick part is increased.

7. The principal places in which this phlegm or Rhume is contained, and the
members by it afflicted, are the Stomach, the Bowels and the Head.

8. The Head by too much Study and Intensness of the mind upon serious and
weighty matters, is much debilitated, and the Animal spirits by too much
wearying of the Brain; are spent: being thus affected, it cannot digest that
aliment ordained for its use, neither can it dissipate those superfluities
there bred, by the strength of its native heat and spirits.

9. From the lower parts of the Body a new and more Copious matter than is
expedient, is ministered; For oftentimes through study and business undertaken
presently after eating, by reason of the Crudity of the Stomach, vapors and
thick fumes are drawn up to the Head, which the Brain entertains as a guest,
because it is not able to resist and drive them away at the first coming,
neither can dissipate them when they are once received.

10. After this manner the Head is filld with Vapors, which are easily
condensed into humors, as it is evident by the vapors which coming out of the
pot to the cover, are converted to Water; the like is discerned in the
procreation of Clouds in the air, the Clouds if they have an Existence for some
time in the Air, unless they be dissipated by the heat of the Sun or by the
virtue of Constellations, presently condense themselves into Rain.

11. Even so the Head being weak and destitute of the strength of nature, heat,
and Spirits, it cannot disperse the superfluous moisture of the Brain, but
retains and hides it in some corner of the Brain, but having got strength, it
causes it to evaporate through the Pores of the part.

12. When these humidities abound, there is a fluctuation in the Head, which is
a certain presage of a Catarrh, afterward when the matter and some irritating
quality that attends it, such as extreme Cold, a melting heat, or some
Impetuous perturbation of the mind, does afflict a person, then at first there
is a distillation from the Head of some thin and watery Rhume which becomes
tough and clammy.

13. And the Catarrh being now ripe, a certain kind of snot or snivel, thick
and of a yellow color flows from it.

14. As soon as there is any Rhume in the Brain, it is either infipid or sweet,
but if it sticks long in the Ventricles of the Brain, it becomes salt and
sharp: this is the reason of a Catarrh from the Head.

15. A Catarrh that falls by the bone (...) into the Nostrills, is innocent:
and although by this kind of Expurgation the Head is made heavy, and is
sometimes stuffed, and Respiration is more difficult, and the Voice not so clear,
yet by this passage appointed for the Expurgation of the Brain, the Rhume falls
down and is cast forth, and so there is less danger than if it did seek a
passage another way.

16. The Excrements of the Head fall down sometimes on the exterior parts, as
appears by Pimples, Blisters, and such like, and then the Head having expelled
the Humor, is a little Light.

17. We have done with the Discourse about the Rhume of the Head, now as to
that which is in the Stomach and Inward parts: the Rhume which is in the
Stomach is tough and viscid, although at first it appears to be thin, it
acquires this Clamminess by the defect of heat.

18. For the heat of the Body is weaker than to digest things that are Crude
and not to bred phlegm, or to attenuate things thus bred; but through this
defect the matter comes to the Consistency of Snot.

19. Moreover if there be Rhume in the Orifice of the Stomach, the Appetite is
diminished and because of the Sympathy of the Brain, and Heart, the strength
Languishes.

20. If it be in the bottom of the Stomach, its heat is rendered dull, by reason
of the coldness of the Rhume. Now follows therefore Crudity, and its flatulent
off spring, the distention of the Belly, a Rumbling, Belching, and a
fluctuation of the meat therein.

21. And the phlegm increasing, there is caused a Loathing or Nauseating, from
the Mouth comes a clear water, but somewhat tough, there is frequent spitting,
and a desire of Vomiting.

22. But if the Belly be Costive, and the Wind as it were penned within the
Stomach and cannot any ways get out, the Sick must needs be afflicted with a
great Pain.

23. In the Bowels, or Inward parts, the Rhume which of it self holds fast
enough, only acquires a Crassity and toughness that it may stick to the Bowels,
and it is called a Vitreous phlegm, being congealed after the manner of Glass,
and coming forth clean and viscous, or slimy like melted Glass.

24. The humors being in this state, are not violently to be drawn forth, but
to be gently moved and expelled: for the Evacuation of which, the Domestic
Potion following is excellent.

25. Take Sena, two drams: Ginger, Cinnamon, half a scruple: Rosemary flowers,
one pugil: thin Chicken-broth, six ounces: put the Spices in boiling hot, and
infuse them in a warm place and in a vessel close covered for one whole Night;
then increase the fire till they begin just to boil; strain all through a
linen cloth without pressing: in this strained Liquor dissolve of the best
Manna one ounce: put it over a gentle heat till it is perfectly dissolved,
stirring it all the while with a spatula or spoon: being dissolved, strain
again, and let the Patient take it warm, about five a Clock in the Morning,
immediately drinking after it a little choice Cinnamon water, to wash away the
unpleasant taste, and prevent Vomiting.

26. Let him now and then take simple broth till it has wrought three times,
and forbear eating any Food till it has done Working, which will be in the
space of about five hours.

27. This Potion, although it consists but of few things, and those ordinary,
for which cause some may despise it, yet it has a most praiseworthy operation;
and without any Violence or inconvenience evacuates the most evil and
pertinacious Humors, both pituitous and bilious, not only from the Stomach and
Bowels, but also from the Head it self.

28. The cause or matter of the Disease being taken away, it will now be less
dangerous; but if by chance, by reason of the great plenty thereof, all cannot
be carried off by one Purgation, it is to be so often repeated, (but at
reasonable distances of time) as need shall require.

29. Afterward, to comfort the Stomach, Liver, and other internal Viscera, the
following confect may be taken. Conditum Polychrestum. Take Cheb Myrobalans
condited, Citron peels condited, Limon peels condited, of each six drams:
Bugloss and Cichory roots candied, of each one ounce: Green Ginger condited,
two ounces: Calamus Aromaticus candied, half an ounce: Spanish lettice candied,
one ounce: Cinnamon cut small one scruple: Mace, half a scruple: bruise all
together grossly, and add thereto Conserve of Roses, one ounce: Rob of English
Currants, three drams: Marmalade of Quinces, one ounce: beat them well and make
a Confect: of this may be taken every morning about seven of the Clock the
quantity of a large Chestnut or Walnut. It comforts the Head and Bowels; drys
up the relics of moist humors, warms and comforts the Stomach, strengthens
the Heart and Liver, and recreates the Spirits.

30. The same is done by the following Rotule or Rouls, save that they heat and
dry the Stomach and Brain more powerfully: Take species Diaphaenicon, two
drams: Rhubarb, half a dram: Extract of Rhubarb, half an ounce: Aromaticum
Rosatum, five drams: Extract of Calamus Aromaticus, two drams: White Sugar, two
ounces: dissolve in Dodder water, and make a Confect for Rouls.

31. After the taking of these things the following Stomach Powder may be
Exhibited. Pulvis Stomachalis: Take fine powder of Liquorice, one ounce:
Galingal, Cloves, of each two drams: Wood of Aloes, Cubebs, of each four
scruples: Calamus Aromaticus, half an ounce: Mace, Nutmegs, of each two drams
two scruples: biting Cinnamon, Ginger, of each six drams: confect of Aniseeds,
four ounces: confect of Caraways, of Fennel seeds, of Coriander seeds, of each
two ounces; make all according to Art, into a fine powder.

32. But most admirable are the Grains of Pepper, being taken seven or eight at
a time cut in halves, to wit every Morning, and fasting two hours after taking
of them: Though it seems a mean thing, it is a Medicament not to be contemned
nor despised, nothing does more powerfully warm and comfort the Stomach and
Head, and excite the heat of the Liver. Aniseeds discuss Wind in the Ventricle;
but Fennel seeds more powerfully dissipate Fumes in the Head, being taken when
made into Comfits. And to prevent the ascending up of Fumes, Comfits of
Coriander seed are very profitable. But the former two, ought to be taken
before meals; the latter viz. the Coriander comfits, after eating.

33. Outwardly this following bag may be applied to the Region of the Stomach.
Sacculus Stomachalis: Take leaves of Wormwood, Spear-mint, Origanum, Betony, of
each one handful: Marjoram, Calamint, red Roses, of each half a handful:
Aniseeds, three drams: Cummin seeds, two scruples: Calamus Aromaticus, two
drams: Bay berries husked, a dram and half: bruise them grossly, and quilt them
in a square stomacher made of very fine Linen or Silk, which apply by hanging
about the Neck.

34. Lastly to strengthen the Liver, and to amend its intemperature, the
following Confect will be of good use. Conditum Epaticum. Take roots of Cichory
candied, one ounce: of Bugloss, and of Green Ginger, all candied, of each half
an ounce: Citron peels candied, five drams: Orange peels candied, three drams:
Nutmegs candied, two drams: Marmalade of Quinces, one ounce: Cinnamon cut small,
half a dram: Calamus Aromaticus cut small, or in gross powder, one scruple:
Mace cut small, half a scruple: Conserve of Roses six drams: beat all very well
together in a Brass or Iron Mortar, and make a Confect. Of this let the
Quantity of a Chestnut be taken at a time.

35. Now through the whole progress of this Cure, you must take care that the
Belly be not obstructed or bound hard up: if so you must give things Loosening,
as stewed Prunes, roasted Apples, Manna dissolved in Chicken broth, with other
things of like Nature. I pray God that he would give a Blessing upon these
remedies. Scholzius ex Casp. Hofmanno, Consil Med. 6.

LIII. A Catarrh with Hoarseness in a Noble Matron.

1. I caused the Belly to be moved with the following Lenitive. Take Cassia
newly extracted, Electuary lenitivum of each half an ounce: Diaphenicon half a
dram: mix and with Sugar make a Bolus: this causes Concoction, drying up,
interception, and expectoration of the thin matter.

2. Digestion is to be caused by using the following Digestive potion and
Rowls: Take Syrups of Jujubes, six drams: syrups of Violets, of Hyssop, and
Oxymel simple, of each half an ounce: Waters of Maiden hair, of Violets, of
Scabious, of each two ounces: Sperma Ceti, half a scruple: mix and make a
draught. The digestive rouls: Take species Diarrhodon abbatis, Diacinnamomum,
Plerisarconticon, of each a dram and half: white Sugar, three ounces and a
half: dissolved in Fennel water: mix, and make Rouls according to Art.

3. Repeat the Digestive commonly used, which mightily takes away the
Hoarsness: Take syrup of Maiden hair, one ounce: syrup of Liquorice one ounce:
sperma Ceti, one scruple: Fennel water six draws: mix for two Doses to be taken
in two mornings fasting.

4. The following Pills, to be taken at six or seven a Clock in the morning.
Take Pil. de Agarico, Pil. Cochiae Pil. Aurae, of each one scruple: Diagridium
three grains, mix and with Betony water, make Pills, in number 21, for three
Doses; drinking after them a strong decoction of Pease.

5. The following Lohoch may be held in the Mouth that it may destill down the
Trachea arteria or Wind pipe by degrees. Take Lohoch Sanum, two ounces: Lohoch
of Pine-nuts, one ounce: Sperma Ceti, half a dram: mix them, and with syrup of
Liquorice make a Lohoch or soft Electuary.

6. Lastly, the following Troches may be held under the Tongue. Trochisci
Sublinguales. Take Species Diatragacanthon frigidum, two drams: Diapapaveris,
one dram: with syrup of Violets make a mass, of which form small Troches. These
with the help of God will perfect the Cure. Scholzius ex Nevio, Cons. Med. 335.

LIVE. A simple Catarrh.

1. I allow of Troches made of the extract of Calamus Aromaticus provided they
be not taken immediately after Meat, but as for anointing the Stomach I do not
well approve of it, because though the matter which afflicts may be
expectorated, yet it renders the part laxative and obnoxious to distillations.

2. You may use Oxymel with the Cinnamon Water, and to the Head you may apply
the powder of red Roses in a sweet-bag with a little white Amber pulverised.
Laurentius Scholzius Cons. 8. out of Crato.

LV. A Catarrh not complicated.

1. There are two things that are good for this Disease one of them, is a
powder of man's Bones burnt in a Furnace to a whiteness, and then bruised to
Flower, and so with a little Rose Water laevigated on a porphyry stone, adding
also a little Cinnamon.

2. Take the powder of Bones burnt, one ounce: Cinnamon contused, one dram:
White Sugar, a sufficient quantity, mix them; and then take one dram for a dose
in white Wine before sleep, or in the morning, in warm Broth or Gruel: you may
if you so please augment the dose.

3. And the following things may be added, Bole Armoniack, red and light-Terra
sigillata, yellow Sanders, Hartshorn, etc.

4. There may be formed trochisks of Bole Armoniack and the best Frankincense,
and the syrup of Stoechas, to the use as above mentioned.

5. If Man's Bones do not please, let him take Ox-bones: but the use of the
former in all Catarrhs is counted most beneficial.

6* Frankincense at the hour of rest swallowed whole does good; For by it the
Stomach, Bowels, Liver and the rest are strengthened.

7. A ley of Herbs, every week, is useful, chiefly of such as are Cephalicks,
such are Ditany, Sage, Betony, Marjoram, Staechas, Roses, Camomil, Agarick, and
Soap, mixed with the like.

8. Take Venice Soap, four ounces: Agarick, two drams: Ireos, Cinnamon,
Gilly-flowers, of each five drams: Camphir, five scruples: mix them; and with
Marjoram water a sufficient quantity, let there be a Soap made according Art.

9. Also a perfumed pomamber with amber, musk, etc. will do well, being once
handled and then put to the Nose.

10. Guajacum decocted made into the form of a thin syrup, and taken in the
morning is good, with one spoonful of the following Electuary either before
sleep at night, or in the morning fasting. Take of the wood Guajacum or
Pockwook pulverised five pound: Mellis Rosatum strained, a sufficient quantity:
mix it after the manner of an Electuary.

11. Sage my way taken is good: the suffumigation of Frankincense is most
wholesome: the Gum of the Juniper tree stops distillations.

12. The following mixture is to be prepared, and an half ounce thereof to be
taken in the morning, or before sleep. Take Cheb Myrobalans condited, one
ounce: Citron peel condited, one ounce: the powder of Nutmegs, two drams:
mastick, one dram: Honey of Roses, fifteen ounces: mix them.

13. Gith burnt and pulverizated, held to the Nose is very good: the other help
which was noted, is Woormwood-wine, sweetened with Honey, and Sage-wine: from
these the members and belly will be much strengthened. Laurentius Scholzius ex
Donzelino Cons. 9.

LVI. An Inveterate Catarrh.

1. Let the following syrup be Continued for three days: Take Maidenhair,
Veronica, flower of Violets, Scabious, Mallows, of each one pugil: the roots of
Marshmallows, Liquorice, of each one dram and an half; the seeds of
Faenugreek, two drams: Nettles, one dram: Basil, half a dram: and Figs Numb.
six; let these be boiled in three pound of water to two pound and an half: and
to be strained, two pound, add Honey of Violets, two ounces and an half: let it
be given for three potions.

2. The fourth day Infuse into the Remainder the leaves of Sena three drams:
new agarick, Trochiscated one dram: let them stand in the Infusion. Take of the
straining made by strong pressing, five ounces: Manna Calabrina one ounce:
Oxymel, half an ounce: mix them.

3. Let this Lambitive be diffused one the Tongue Morning and Evening: Take the
syrup of Violets, the juice of Veronica or fluelin, of each two ounces: the
Species Bechicae, Diaireos, Diatragacathon without Camphir, of each one dram:
fine Bole prepared, three drams: mix them.

4. Also Take confectio Bechica without Elicampane, three ounces: And let him
be anointed with the Oil of sweet Almonds; to which a drop of the Oil of Anis
may be added.

5. Let there be a Sweet-bagg laid to his Head of the following: Take of
Coriander prepared, red Sanders, of each two drams: red Roses, one pugil:
Ambergrise, three grains: and strew upon them powder of Cotton or Cudwort, and
make thereof a bagg.

6. Take in by the Nostrils the perfume of the following powder: Take the
powder of Marjoram, three drams: the powder of Ginger, half a dram: mix them.

7. Let the Breast be often anointed with the following Liniment. Take the Oil
of sweet Almonds, one ounce and an half: fresh Hens grease, one ounce: mix them.

8. An exact diet is to be observed, your Wine must be sweetened with Sugar, or
mixed with Water. Laurentius Scholzius, Cons. 11.

LVII. A Catarrh, and its Symtomes.

1. The Catarrh is the first Cause of all your Evils. For if it seizes the
Stomach and the Inward parts, it Breeds a Chollick, if the Joints, then a Gout,
if the Breast, then a Cough and straitness or difficulty of Respiration,
oftentimes it happens that the Chollick is turned to a Gout, and the Gout into
a Chollick.

2. The procatartick Cause of the Disease is a cold Stomach, hot Liver and
moist Brain.

3. To these the frequent Distillations that happen by Eating of Meats that are
Excrementitious, and the provoking of the paroxysms, spring and fall; together
with the Excrements that are gathered Summer and Winter, being stired up, Cause
us to make a hard prognostic indeed, viz. that a full Cure is scarcely so be
Expected; a mitigation will suffice the following Rules being Observed.

4. First, all Excrementitious meats are to be avoided, and meats of good a
Juice are to be taken moderately and at seasonable times.

5. And least Excrements should abound, let there be taken Eccopropticks and
gentle purges and cleansers.

6. Secondly; Endeavors must be used to prevent the distillations: thirdly,
the Stomach, Liver, Brain and Joints are to be strengthened and dried; and the
Belly to be Loosned by the following Electuary: Take Cassia Extracted with
water, Elder flowers, one ounce: the powder of Soldanela, half a dram: white
Sugar a sufficient quantity sprinkled on: make a Bolus, but if you are not
pleased with Soldanela, take in the place, Rhubarb half a dram or fifteen
grains.

7. And every month, least the Excrements abound, take the following Pills an
hour before Super. Take pil. hiera, half a dram: pil. aureae, Aggregative, of
each seven grains: Diagridium one grain: or Elaterium, which is better, make
Pills to the number of twenty four with simple Oxymel.

8. Secondly, the Disease returns at set Intervals, as once in six months; have
a Care, principally at the Spring and Fall; and let this purgative Decoction be
continued, but so, as to be by turns pretermitted, and the third day after the
administration draw four ounces of Blood out of the hepatick Vein.

9. Take the Waters of Elder flowers, Betony, Primrose, Garden-endive, of each
one ounce and an half: syrup of Betony two ounces: Endive, one ounce: honey of
Roses strained one ounce and an half: mix them. Dose nine or ten Spoonfuls.

10. Take of the Roots of Peony, one ounce: Capers, six drams: Betony,
Asparagus, of each half an ounce: madder 3 drams: Asarum 2 drams: tops of
Betony, Primrose, Grond pine, Asparagus, Endive, Hypericon, Wild Basil,
Cetrack, Scolopendrium, of each half an handful: seeds of peony, Anis, Fennel,
of each two drams: the Cordial Flowers of each half an handful: Liquorice,
half an ounce: Currants five drams: polypode of the Oak fresh gathered, one
ounce and an half: the leaves of the best Sena, Tormentilla cleansd, three
ounces: white agarick, two drams: white Ginger, two scruples: Citron peels, one
ounce: Cinnamon, one dram: Myrobalans, half an ounce; let them be all cut and
bruised, and infuse them in a sufficient quantity of the water of Betony,
Primrose, Asparagus, Endive, scolopendrium, of each a like measure, mix: boil
them in a vessel close covered to the consumption of the half: or to two pound;
let it be strained by hard Expression, in that which is strained out, Infuse
for the space of an hour, Soldanella, one ounce and an half: Jews Ears one
dram: then take choice Rubarb, one dram and an half: Squinanth, one scruple:
let them be beaten and so make a nodul of a rag tied with astring; boil it, and
whilst it boyls let it be pressed till you have all the virtue, and then,
having cast away the nodul, strain it without any expression.

11. When it is straind, put to it the syrup of Betony two ounces: Endive one
ounce: Honey of Roses strained, two ounces: mix them and make a decoction. Dose
four ounces and a half.

12. If it do not woik four or five times quicken it with the following
Electuary. Take choice Diasebesten sine Diagrydium, Benedictum Laxativum, of
each one dram and a half, mix them.

13. The Body being once purged, a drink of Guajacum is wholesome, and indeed
Sarsaparila, does more, which mightily strengthens the Stomach more then
guajacum can do.

14. The Members generative and Transmitting are to be strengthened, as the
Stomach Liver and Brain, which administer matter to the Catarrh, with the
following Consection: Take species Aromaticum Rosatum, one dram: diarrhodon
abbatis, two scruples: plirisarconticon, one dram: the seeds of peony huld and
dried, two scruples: Elicampane roots, one dram: Mace two scruples: Nutmeg one
scruple: the shavings of Ivory, half a scruple: white Amber, two scruples: Wood
of Aloes, one scruple: red Coral, half a dram: red Roses, half a scruple:
Cinnamon, 2 scruples: the pouders being pulverized subtly with the species
and with seven ounces of white Sugar, dissolved in Hearts tongue water, and
boiled to a thickness, make a confection in Rouls.

15. But to the more Effectual Exsiccation and drying of the Brain, a
suffumigation of the following powder will be very profitable, and an Emplaster
to be applied to the Head, whilst the distillation Requires. Take yellow Amber,
one ounce: white Amber, one dram: Olibanum, one dram and an half: Mastich, two
drams: Gum of Juniper, one dram and an half: Turpentine, one dram: red Myrrh,
half a dram: storax Calamita, one dram and an half: Wood of Aloes, one scruple:
beat them grossly to the bigness of hemp seed and make Pills, for a fume. Dose
is one pugil.

16. Take Mastick, Gum of Juniper, Nutmegs tosted, of each one scruple: Cloves
in subtle powder, half a scruple: pure Labdanum, six scruples: let it be beaten
with a hot pestel in a Mortar; make a mass with the Oil of Mastick, which must
be spread on soft Leather to the thickness of a half crown, and covered with
red woven Silk, lay it as a plaster on the Crown of the Head, which must be
removed when the person Eats.

17. And for the space of two days the Nostrills and Tongue must be anointed
with the Oil of Nutmegs, to the quantity of a Pea, or Lentil, which is a great
dryer.

18. The Limbs and Joints will be much comforted by abstinence from Venery,
Wine, and perplexity of the Mind.

19. Washing of the Feet will do good: Take water in which red hot Steel is
extinguished, and when it is strained add Acorn-cups, Salt, of each two
handfuls: Alum, half a pound: let them boil for an hour, and strain out: in the
Colature put your Feet up to the Knees.

20. Afterward anoint them with the following Ointment; and repeat it twice or
thrice in a Week: Take the oils of Earthworms, of Myrtles, of Roses Complete,
of each two ounces: Earthworms prepared, six drams: of Salt that is
decripitated, one ounce: Acorn cups, two drams and a half: Crude Alum, one dram.

21. But if an Ague-fit be at hand, then the humors are to be Evacuated: Take
the pulp of of Cassia (extracted with Elder-flower-water) six drams: and
dissolve it in four ounces: Decoction of flowers and fruit; adding the powder
of Soldanella, half a dram: Benedictum Laxativum, two scruples and an half:
syrup of Betony one ounce: mix them.

22. If the humors cause a Pain and a Tumor, make use of this anodyn: Take
Bean-flower, meals of Orobus, of Peace, of Lentils, of each half an ounce: Line
seed, six drams: the powder of the flowers of Camomil, three drams: Melilot,
two drams: Saffron well pulverised, one scruple: let them be boiled in a
sufficient quantity of Camomil-flower-water, to the thickness of a Pultise: add
two yolks of Eggs raw, well beaten: Oil of Camomil two drams and make a
Cataplasm; and lay it to warm, and when it is dry let it be renewed.

23. Those pains being laid a Sleep, a greater astriction is required for the
strengthening of the Joints: Take the species of the Cataplasm, (the yolks of
Eggs, Saffron and oil of Camomil being omitted, put in the place of them,) the
powder of red Roses, one dram and an half: Acorn-cups, half a dram: pure Bole,
one dram: mix them and make a Plaster, or in the place of this a plaster of
Oxycrocium, and Emplastrum nigrum.

24. The fourth or fifth day the matter is to be diverted by pills or a gentle
Potion.

25. And although in pains of the Podagra the prescribed Cataplasms are of
great virtue and Efficacy; yet the Pultisses made of the Crum of white Bread,
boyld with Saffron in Goats-milk, with four yolks of Eggs, are not without
their Virtue.

26. And in all pains of weaknesses of the Joints, and great Inflammations, the
following water is approved of: Take Nettle water, two pound; Endive, Purslane,
Nightshade, of each half a pound, fine Bole, two scruples: Mucilage of
Fleawort seeds, extracted with Purslane water, one ounce: mix them* dip your
Cloth in it and apply them warm. Laurentius Scholzius, Cons. 12.

LONDON, Printed for Th. Dawks, and L. Curtiss.

The Chapter of the Catarrh continued. Numb. 44.

LVIII. A Catarrh complicated with other Symptoms.

1. All Symptoms and Circumstances being examined, the first Cause and Original
of all Evils of your Body, is the Catarrh; For when the Brain, partly by
Nature, as an Haereditary right, partly by Studies and Cares, and partly by too
plentiful feeding is made weak and moist, then it is troubled with a Catarrh,
which afflicts the Stomach and Joints.

2. And from thence frigidity, humidity and crudity, etc. also cruel goutish
Pains, and the very phlegmatic humors themselves, attracted from the Reins
begets Obstructions and the Stone.

3. But when this Evil is inbred, and no hopes appears of being freed there
from for many years; endeavors must be used to abate the Distillation, least
with violence it sieze the Joints.

4. The Stomach is to be Purged with gentle Medioines, and seeing the Body is
rather apt to be of an ill Digestion than over full of good Blood, you may take
a little Blood away, at the Liver-Vein.

5. Secondly, The Diet is to be regulated, without which there can be no hope
of Health.

6. Galen says, That the Intemperate, and such as are addicted to gratify their
Belly and Throat, are Gouty, and that Purgation and letting of Blood, do but
little avail such. For by Intemperance they Contract an abundance of Crude
Humors.

7. Let your Drink be Mead, made of ten parts Water, one Honey; to which add
Nutmegs, and the leaves of Sage; bottle them all together.

8. Thirdly, The Evacuation of the Body, is twofold, viz. universal and
particular: The first is that which Exonerates the body every half year, which
is called the Vernal and Autumnal Evacuation; and is carefully accomodated to
the Constitution of the Body by every Skillful Physician.

9. The last, which is the particular Evacuation is done by common Pills,
called by the Physicians Debiles Fortes; the number of the Dose is five or
seven about the hour of Sleep, after a slender Supper, they purge gently the
Stomach and Brain, and diverts the Humors from the Joints, if taken twice a
Month.

10. Pilulae debiles fortes, Take Species Hiera picra simple, Pills of Mastich,
of each two scruples: Pills of Hermodacts Compound greater and lesser: Pilulae
Arthriticae, of each half a dram: choice Rhubarb, two scruples: Agarick
trochiscated, half a dram: Epithymum, one scruple: Mastich, seven grains:

Species Diarrhodon abbatis, half a scruple: powder what are to be poudred and
with Betony Water a sufficient quantity, make a mass of Pills; out of a dram of
which form one and twenty Pills.

11. Or, in the place of these, you may take Electuarium Arthriticum, one dram
or two, four hours before Dinner.

12. The Morsels and Electuary every day, are to be taken before Dinner and
Supper, but every Week by turns.

13. The Morsels: Take Pine-nuts that are pure, cleansed and washed in
Betony-water, three drams: fresh Pistach-nuts washed after the same manner and
for three hours infused, two drams: Almonds brought to a Pulp, two drams and a

ounce: Diatrion Santalon, one ounce: beat the things that are to be beaten, and
mix them with the Syrup of Citron-peels condited to a thickness and so let it
be covered with leaf Gold.

15: Anoint the Stomach thrice a day with the Stomachical Ointment, and some
days being past, apply the following Cere-Cloth: Take Stomach Ointment, two
ounces: Stomach Cerate as much: mix them, and spread upon Leather, let the form
thereof be as that of a Target, cover it with Flax or fine Silk and sew it
together.

16. The Catarrh will be drawn away from the inferior parts, an Emplaster
being applied to the Coronal Suture: Take of the Cephalic Cerecloth, or Cerate
for the upper part of the Head, two ounces and a half: divide into equal parts,
and extend them upon two long Skins of like form with the part, and cover it
with fine Flax or Silk.

17. Diatragacanth frigid, mixed with fine Bole and kept under the Tongue till
dissolved, will moisten the Aspera Arteria; and strong Ligatures being often
used about the Ligaments of the Joints, have a great efficacy for diverting the
Distillation, and abstemiousness will give you great ease.

18. The Pains of the Back, Reins, and Stone, may be mitigated with Ointments,
Plasters, Clysters, and a Bath of Garden-Mallows, Marshmallows, Camomil,
Melilot, the Roots of Parsley, etc. or a Fomentation for the Back: Take leaves

Lauri, ten grains: Juniper Berries, half a handful: the leaves of Hypericon,
one pugil: seeds of Annise, Fennel, of each two drams and an half: Roots of

are to be cut, and those be beaten which are to be beaten, and boil them all
together in two pound of Running-water to the consumption of a fourth part,
strain out, and put the Colature into an Earthen Vessel, to which add one ounce
of burnt Wine: let this fomentation be used for the Pains of the Back.

20. Take the Oil of white Lillies, 3 drams: Violets, half an ounce: sweet
Almonds, Camomil, of each three drams: Oil of Scorpions, half an ounce:

Mallow-Water and Camomil-flower Water to a thickness; afterward add the
Mucilages, and with Wax, make a Plaster: which let there be applied after the
Bath or Fomentation.

22. The Joints may be strengthened with an astringent Fomentation and
Ointment, and though the Cauteries and Issues were open, yet there were no more
danger: Take the Water that hot Iron has been often extinguished in: the Galls
of Cypress, to the number of twenty: the Galls of Oaks, to the number of ten:
Roots of Hermodacts, Peony, of each one ounce: common Salt, half an handful:
Red Roses dry, half a handful: Let the Galls and the Roots be beaten and all

they be all well mixed, and so make a Liniment. Laurentius Scholzius, Cons. 13.

LIX. A Catarrh Cured chiefly by Cauteries or Issues.

1. I am glad that your Cautery has had so good Fortune and I doubt not but it
will do so still, chiefly because the Benumbness and Cramp are much abated, and
the serous matter in a great quantity carried off.

2. Lest the Cautery be healed, great Care must be taken; and this may be
effected with the Vnguentum Apostolorum, or Virgins Wax.

3. The excrescent Flesh may be Consumed by Burnt Alum or precipitate Mercury.

4. The Pills called Debiles Fortes mentioned in the foregoing Section move the
Humors, but when they are a little stronger, they draw the Humors from the
Joints and the lower parts of the Body; but that the burning may not be hurt,
you may sometimes omit them.

5. And when a thin yellowish matter comes out of the Issue, you may use in the
place of them Rhubarb infused after this manner: Take Rhubarb beaten, two
drams: the Powder of Cinnamon, so much as can be held on the point of a Knife;
infuse it for a Night in Endive-water, five spoonfuls: pure Wine, three
spoonfuls: let them stand in a hot place for thirteen hours: in the Colature
expressed dissolve choice Manna, one ounce and make a gentle Potion: It will
excellently ease and rid you of Choleric Excrements.

6. Its no wonder that the Feet swell toward Evening, because of frequent
toylsome Perigrinations, and this Tumor rather proceeds from the Vapors than
from the Humors.

7. You must for the future forbear frequent motion, least the Feet be hurt
which are weakened with a daily Gout, and when the Swelling does manifestly
appear, the prescribed Topics are to be deferred, not so much for avoiding the
Repercussion as the attraction. Joh. Nevius apud Laurentium Scholzium, Cons.
Med. 14.

LX. A Salt Catarrh.

1. If the Catarrh is Salt and it be attended with a Fever, especially if it
proceed from too great heat of the Liver, I allow of Letting Blood at the
Basilica or common Vein.

2. Let there be an Evacuation with Manna, Cassia, and Honey solutive; In the
Mouth hold Diacodion or Diatragacanthum with fine Bole.

3. Take one scruple of the Pills of Cynoglossa, in the form of a Pill, or with
Sugar of Roses, or Violets.

4. Drink often the sweet Almond Milk, especially before Sleep, and if it be
expedient you may add the Seeds of Melons, or white Poppy.

5. Let him Drink Barley-water, with the Julep of Violets, or Sugar boiled with
a little Cinnamon.

6. Your Meat may be Ptisan, Mallows, Beets, Gourds, Spinach, Bread boiled in
broth thickened with fine Flower, Sugar, and the Seeds of of Melons. You may
also eat small Birds, the Yolks of Eggs, but be moderate in the use of Salt;
the Kernel of Pine-nuts eat often, as also the Pulp of sweet and well tasted
Apples (the rind or Paring being thrown away) boiled with Honey, like to an
Electuary, to be taken often with a Spoon, or upon a Knifes point, sweet
Almonds, Filberts, Pears, Olives pickled, Lettice, Bugloss, Borrage, Fish of
gravelly places, Cheb, Myrobalans condited: Diacidonium without the Species,
and Sugar of Roses are all very profitable: For bearing strong Wine, a
plentiful Supper and Drinking after Supper, frequent Coition, and Baths or hot
Houses.

7. Use a sweet Lixivium, or lie thrice in a Month, with Agarick and Roses, and
Camphorated Soap.

8. Before Sleep take one Spoonful of the Conserve of Water Lillies on the
Coronal Sutures, sprinkle the Powder of Roses, Sanders, Sumach, Galls,
Hartshorn, fine Bole, Coral, and the Shavings of Ivory:

9. There may be prepared a Saponea after this manner: Take white Sugar, three
ounces: Amylum, Rose Water, of each one ounce and a half: mix them before a
soft fire, till they come to a middle consistency, and then make little Balls
or Morsels: it must be used before Sleep and and every day.

10. I allow of the use of Trochisks of Aetius, (tertiae tetrabili, Sermon
primo, cap. x. cujus titulus.) and I have found good in a Decoction of Honey in
Water wherein Roses have been first steeped, after this manner: Take five
quarts of Water and two of Honey, make a Decoction, and take off the filth from
the top as it arises, put into it a little Bag, full of Roses and let them boil
a sufficient while, which take in the Morning instead of a Syrup.

11. But two remedies I have found most effectual both in my Self and others.
The first, fine Bole, being red, light, simple and alone, which applied to the
Tongue and Palate at Night (being the usual time of a Distillation) presently
stops and drys up the Catarrh, and to admiration comforts and strengthens the
Head.

12. The other Remedy is new Venice Treacle, or as some call it, Treacle of
Andromachus, which has a notable Virtue against sharp Distillations.

13. The third which I here add, is the Bones of a Man burnt to a Powder, but
especially the Skull: Take the Powder of Man's Bones burnt, one ounce: white
Coral, the shavings of Ivory, of each one dram: Camphir, one scruple: mix them
and make a subtle Powder: Dose one dram in Wine or Broth; it may be prepared
into little Balls or Rowls with Sugar, or with Conserves of Roses, or of
Violets. Laurentius Sc^olzius, Cons. 15.

LXI. A Salt Catarrh from evil Humors.

1. A Catarrh that is Salt, either proceeds from putrid Phlegm, or from the
mixture of an adust Humor, which is to be purged by some slender Purgation, as
Manna, one ounce and a half dissolved in broth.

2. Afterward Diacodium and these small Balls are to be kept in the Mouth:
Take white Poppy-seeds, one dram: Rose water, four ounces: add also the Powder
of Tragacanthum, half a scruple: and take sometimes the Sugar of Roses mixed
with fine Bole.

3. Balls made of Rhubarb, formerly mentioned in the Discourse about the
Hemicrania, by degrees Purge out the putrid and salt Humors. Laurentius
Scholzius; Cons. 16.

LXII. A Catarrh or Salt Distillation.

1. When the Distillation is Salt, and the Habit of the body is such, that
there is no want of Blood, a little may be taken away, if thereby the heat of
the Liver and Reins be abated, and the Liver Vein is to be pricked, if the
blood so require, and the effect diswade not.

2. Issues are also to be tried besides the opening of a Vein: one Issue to be
in the left Arm, the other in the right Leg.

3. As for Medicines you may use the following: gently purge the Belly, either
by Cassia with a little Diacatholicon and Manna, (but if you would rather have
a Potion) then take Manna with the Honey of Roses, or the Honey of Violets
solutive; the Syrup of Roses and Violets solutive, I cannot much dis-approve
of: and if the Belly continue still Costive, moderate Clysters are safe.

4. The matter being rendered fit for Purgation, use this Medicine Compounded of
Honey, of Roses with Vinegar, or of Oxymel simple, syrup of Apples simple,
Borrage, Succory, and after the first Purgation, Betony may be made use of: the
taking of which between whiles, being profitable against the Stone, did render
some Suspicion thereof.

5. The matter of the Disease still giving way to these Purgative Medicines,
add further Agarick, or Rhubarb, or their Infusions in a Pectoral Decoction
with the leaves of Sena: the Honey of Roses Solutive and Manna being added; or
mixed with Cassia, if a Potion be better liked.

6. It is expedient that the matter of the Distillation which is offensive to
the Brain, be carried down to the Nostrils by a Sternutatory made of the Juice
of Betony, the Elder-tree and Nigella, milder Medicines also may be added, as
Manna, but chiefly Barley-water.

7. If the former prevail not, it is fit to apply somewhat that may dry up and
consume the Morbifick matter, but so (...) ^ot to increase the Distemperature
of the Bowels: Take choice China, and the third part of the Sassafras, adding
also Succory, Coltsfoot and Betony, make a Decoction according to Art, which
let it be taken for forty days more or less, according to the quantity of the
Salt phlegm abounding.

8. We also advised the Illustrious Baron, at the time of taking this Decoction
and afterward, that he take the following Electuary Compounded of Mithridate,
Stoechas and Betony, mixed with the Conserve of Succory and Roses, which
Conserves alone have all the Summer wonderful effects.

9. But since it is necessary the distemperature of the Bowels, as also of the
Head, Stomach, Liver and Reins be removed, let there be applied to the Coronal
Suture distilled Waters moderately heating; of which kind are the Waters
distilled from Stoechas, Betony, Hyssop and such like to be applied as
aforesaid.

10. Of this Classis is also the Cerate of Betony; washes also for the Head
with the addition of Agarick.

11. There is also a Medicament for the Stomach which is as good as any can be
used, it must be Compounded of the Oils of Spike, Wormwood, Mint, Nutmeg,
Mastich, with the Infusion of Cinnamon, Mace, the Wood of Aloes and
Clove-gilliflowers in Malmsey, or some brisk Wine: Let the Decoction be for an
hour in a double Vessel, and then there will result an Oil, with which anoint
the Stomach and all its Evils shall suddenly be removed.

12. The heat of the Liver may be remitted, if you but apply Succory mixed with
a small quantity of Vinegar: these and the like being used, you may easily
overcome the heat of the Liver and the Reins; if the heat be not yet gone, take
the Whey of Goats Milk clarified.

13. Nor does the coldness of the Stomach forbid the use of these things, if
before or at the same time the Stomach be cherished by the application of hot
things.

14. All these inward and outward applications do more effectually overcome
those Symptoms when a good Diet is observed; therefore it is needful that some
mistakes about Diet be amended.

15. You must be careful to avoid all impure unwholesome Air; you must be
moderate in the use of Meats, such as are of a thin and good juice are safe,
and that which the digestive faculty does easily Concoct, and the Expulsive
faculty does without much trouble destribute.

16. If the Food you Eat, whether Flesh, Fish, Herbs or Fruits, offend the Head
and over heat the Liver, it is a sign that they are naught, and you must
forbear them.

17. As for Drink, let your Wine be good and brisk, neither tart nor sour, but
if you take Sassafras decocted, you may forbear Wine altogether, or if you use
it, it must be moderately, or mixed with a second Decoction, especially if the
Stomach cannot easily digest Drink of the second Decoction.

18. Sleep in the day time you must not Covet, and unless Custom compel you, it
must be altogether forborne; neither must you go to Sleep, till two hours be
past after Supper.

19. You must have a care that the Belly be in a good temper; and that it
evacuate every day or every other day, if Nature work spontaniously, and need
but a very little help, you may take Stewed Prunes, or Raisons preserved with
Sugar, and if Nature require it, a little fresh or newly gathred Manna, neither
do I disaprove of the milder sort of Clysters.

20. A mean must be observed in all Exercises of the body; rest is convenient
when the Stomach is full; but before Meat Exercise is wholesome. Laurentius
Scholzius, ex Hieron Cappivaccio, cons. 17.

LXIII. A Suffocating Catarrh.

1. They that have been frequently troubled with a Distillation, fall sometimes
into a Suffocating Catarrh, which is no less dangerous than an Apoplexy.

2. Therefore according to the advice of Physicians, Blood is to be taken away,
Frictions are to be made in the Shoulder-blades, Necks, Arms, as also strong
Ligatures, a Vesicatory is to be applied to the Coronal Suture of Leven,
Cantharides and Vinegar.

3. Inwardly you may take Lohoch of Squils or Sea-Onion with Oxymel and
Ammoniacum (a Gum which comes from a certain Ferula,) if the matter be thick
and gross.

4. But if the matter be thin, you may use Pills made of Cynogloss or
Hounds-tongue, yet so as that you exceed not one scruple in the Dose.

5. I thus advise, because in sudden Diseases Physicians are so surpised, that
they cannot sometimes think of proper Remedies. Laurentius Scholzius, ex
Johanne Craton, Cons. 18.

LXIV. A suffocating Catarrh.

1. He lay long with a naked Breast, at last he began to Snort in his Sleep,
and to fetch his Wind thick and short, and the Froth came out so abundantly
that it covered to the breadth of the Palm of the Hand, both his Mouth and
Nostrils; he did seem to be in an Apoplexy, with his Eyes open, without Sense,
without Motion, and as it were without Soul, nothing differing from one Dead,
but only in Respiration, making a most hideous Snorting.

2. At length we raised with the Suffumigation of Amber, and a distilled Water
for those that are Apoplectick, afterward we ordered him to be carried to a
Bath or Hot-house, least the Phlegm continually distilling, should be thickened,
and so the Expulsion thereof more difficult.

3. After a while he came to himself, and now and then this following Water was
prescribed him to take: Take Water wherein Lavender is infused, one ounce and
an half: Lillies-Convally, one ounce: Powder of Castoreum, half a scruple:
Cinnamon Water, one dram: mix them.

4. Anoint the Ears and Temples with the Oil of Nutmegs: Let buttered Ale be
given often very warm, for by this the Phlegm will be indifferent well
Expectorated.

5. At five of the Clock in the Morning apply a Clyster: Take Garden Mallows,
one handful: Marshmallows, Pellitory of the Wall, Origanum, Marjoram, of each
half anhandful: Roots and Seeds of Peony, of each two drams: the flowers of
Stoecbas, one pugil: Centory, Rue, Gout-Ivy, Herba Paralysis, Hyssop, of each
half a handful: Linseed, Foenugreek, Mallows, Annice, Fennel, Agarick, of each
two drams: let them boil in a sufficient quantity of Water to the consumption
of one half; then strain it. Take of the Colature, elev^^ ounces, to which add
Hiera, compound Diaphoenicon, of each three drams and an half: the Oils of
Camomil, of Dii^; of each one ounce: Oil of Wall-flowers, of Rue, of each half
an ounce: Sugar, one ounce: two Yolks of Eggs: Salt, one scruple: mix them for
a Clyster.

6. After so much of the Clyster is taken as he is able to receive, you may
cause him to take day by day alternatively, a little of the following Pectoral
Syrup, which will much help his straightened and obstructed Breath.

7. After the space of an hour, he may take likewise a small quantity of the
following Electuary, viz. about the quantity of half a Filbert.

8. The Syrup: Take syrups of Hyssop, six drams: of Stoechas compound, half an
ounce: Oxymel, Scylliticum, one ounce: Oxymel simple, half an ounce: Infusion
of Lavender in Water, one ounce: Hyssop-Water, half an ounce: mix them.

9. The Electuary: Take Conserves of Sage, of Rosmary-flowers, of Betony, of
each six drams: Lohoch Sanum, Lohoch of Squils, of each half an ounce: best
Mithridate, one dram: Species Diaprassij, Dianthos, Plirisarconticon, of each
one scruple: Diacastoreum, half a scruple: Syrup of Hyssop, a sufficient
quantity, mix and make an Electuary.

10. At three a Clock in the Afternoon, or two hours after Supper; let the
following inciding and cleansing Potion be given: Take Roots of Fennel, of
Parsley, of each three drams: roots of Orrice Florentine, two drams and a half:
of Peony, two drams: of Elecampane, one dram and half: of Liquorice rasped,
half an ounce: seeds of Fennel, of Annise, of each three drams: Carthamus seeds
bull'd, two drams and half: Peony seeds, three drams: Barley hull'd, one
handful: Damask Prunes, number six: Jujubes, number three: Raisons of the Sun,
half an ounce: Leaves of Hyssop, one handful: Horehound, Coltsfoot, Marjoram,
Origanum, Betony, of each half a handful: Sage, Stoechas, of each a pugil: best
Sena, one ounce: Agarick, five drams: Ginger, two drams: boil in fair Water a
sufficient quantity, to the consumption of the half: strain, and to fourteen
ounces thereof, let be added clarified Honey, one ounce and a half: syrup of
Hyssop, one ounce and half: syrup of Stoechas compound, Oxymel simple, and with
Squils, of each half an ounce: choice Cinnabar bruised, one dram: put them into
a bag or tie them up in a rag; give two or three walms, then take it off the
fire and press all out for four Doses. Scholzius Consil. Medic 19. ex Cratone.

LXV. A suffocating Catarrh.

1. This Catarrh was so troublesome to him, that he was often necessitated to
rise at Night out of his bed, and even while he was eating, all by reason of
the repression and stoppage of his Breath, and then walk to divert, if it were
possible, the matter, the which if he had not done, he could scarcely have
breathed. or escaped Suffocation.

2. Nature teaches us that a Catarrh, in the most strong Constitution, is
forthwith to be diverted or turned another way, for it is possible he may find
himself less indisposed when goutish pains sieze him.

3. Nothing seems better for Cure than the use of Cauteries, which I think
should be made not only in the Legs, but also in the Arms, and because of
Winter approaching, a strong Lie is to be made, wherewith I would have the Arm
bathed, and then I would have it rubbed with a course Cloth: and by this means I
would exulcerate these parts, and so keep them that they might not heal,
whereby much of the Morbifick matter will be drained out.

4. And because of the distillation on the breast, the distemperature is much
augmented, and neither the Decoction of Guajacum applied by the present
Physician can take away the Preternatural frigidity and humidity, therefore
there are two other Remedies to be used: the first is this: Take the juice of
Paul's Betony, or syrup of Betony, four ounces: Extract of Calamus Aromaticus,
one dram: mix them. Let him take every Morning two Spoonfuls for ten days.

5. If this Medicine does but little good, then for ten days more, let him Take
the Decection of Carduus Benedictus with the syrup of the juice of Carduus, and
when he has drunk it warm in the Morning: Let him keep in bed for two hours
after he has taken it:

6. But if these two Remedies (a good Diet being still observed) avail not; the
body must be purged and a Cautery made, which indeed ought to be first done
before these two latter Remedies be tried.

7. As for Purgation I know nothing better than Oxymel with Agarick; or Gesner
his Oxymel Compound; which will do very well.

8. I would omit white Hellebor, and increase the weight of Agarick; I found
this to be very good to those that breath painfully, especially if it be taken
with Manna and Syrup of Roses solutive.

9. Now as concerning hot Baths, there is nothing seems more convenient, seeing
they do cool the natural heat, and divert the matter of a Catarrh, by drawing
it forth, therefore as I think this help is not to be neglected: but I would
have them such as would both warm and dry, exulcerate and eat the Skin, and may
also be drunk of. Scholzius, Medic. 20. ex Cratone.

LXVI. A Catarrh with danger of suffocation.

1. It is difficult to Cure Catarrhs that fall on the Breast; for these
Reasons, first, because the temper of the Head is much Changed and the
distempers of the Breast more previous.

2. Another is, from the Indications to be Cured, which are diverse: If the
matter of the Distillation be thin, it requires things cooling and thickning.
But if it be tough, thick, and Viscous, then such things which Expectorate and
do help the Lungs; viz. Cutting and cleansing Medicines.

3. Catarrhs that afflict daily does render the persons Melancholy, because
either they despair of recovering their Health, or they use various and
sometimes improper and unsafe Medicines: but however it is, the Nature of the
Disease, and the Sick person is to be considered; and we are to be directed by
Reason, according to the rule of Hippocrates, he that has not success, when he
acts according to the Rule of Reason, must go no further.

4. I could here recite my Experiences concerning the Nature of the Sick person
and the Disease, but I am not in love with prolix Discourses and tedious
Commentations.

5. Three things therefore occurr worthy observation, in Reference to a Cure:
first, that the temper of the Head, which without doubt is both hot and moist,
be Corrected and that care be taken that it is not hurt, either by External or
Internal Causes.

6. Secondly, that the thinness of the matter distilling be also helped.
Thirdly, that the Breast be succored, on which the Catarrh falls, least the
distillation should suffocate or stop the breath, and wrong the Lungs.

7. As to the first, many Remedies are found out amongst Physicians but those
which with their too great heat are of a drying nature are less safe. Washings
also in a Decoction of cold and drying Herbs can scarce be Commended, if they
be of too abstersive a quality.

8. But when either Custom or Necessity requiers it, you may use a Lixivium in
which the leaves of red Roses and Myrrh are boiled, and when, you have so done,
you may wash the Head with cold Water, and then apply a warm Cloth fumigated
with the Powder of Roses and Storax: and making a bag of Roses and Myrrh, add
thereto the Powder of Coral, and then apply it to the Coronal suture very
frequently.

9. If a greater dryer be required, make a Bagg of Barley-meal, and the Gum of
Ivy, and apply to the hinder part of the Head.

10. But if the distillation be any thing vehemen^, take Leaven with the Powder
of red Sanders mixed with Vinegar and apply to the Head as a Plaster, I would
not (as some do) add to it the spirit of Wine.

11. Some trust much to Vesicatories made of leaven, moistened with Vinegar and
mingled with powder of Canthatides, and then the hair being shaven off apply it
to the Coronal Suture.

12. Yet I do not advise that this remedy be applied, unless extreme necessity
requires it, such as the stoppage the Breath.

13. When that action ceases by which Life it self is supported; all things
that are strong ought to be taken for the preservation of Life; it is safe not
only to use vesicatories, but also Cauteries, Frictions, strong Ligatures, and
all things besides which may divert the matter of the Catarrh:

14, Air that is moist, whether it be hot or cold, is not good, neither is it
safe suddenly to go out of a hot place into a Cold; or in places under the
ground, or in Chambers that are moist, as those that are covered with tile and
are made like a vault; Night Air, and to sleep with the Windows open are
dangerous.

15. Let him hold in his Mouth both in the night and day time, these Rouls:
Take fine Bole prepared, two drams: Gum Arabic, Tragacanthum, of each two
scruples, seed of white Poppy, one dram: Nutmeg toasted, half a dram:
Sugar-Penids, one ounce: sugar candy, half an ounce: with the mucilage of the
seeds of Quinces in Rose Water make little Rowles.

16. A good diet must be observed and that which Causes the Repletion of the
Head with sumes must not be used.

17. There is one thing not to be omitted, which is, that after a powder for
suppressing the Vapors is taken you would Use the flesh or juice of Quinces.

18. The said powder is to be taken prepared after this manner: Take Coriander
prepared, six drams: red Coral, red Roses* of each one dram: Pearls, one
scruple: Sugar, five ounces: mix them.

19. If you will not Use the Powder, dissolve Sugar in Rose Water, and add a
little of the juice of Quinces and make a Confection in Morsels. Let him take
one after meat, or a small spoonful of the Powder.

20. These things here related have Reference to my second Intention, and will
Contribute much to the Removing of the stoppage: But where the the matter runs
with that vehemence that it cannot be stopped nor dried up, and causes some
difficulty of Breathing, you must continue the use of cooling syrups, as the
syrups of Poppy, of Jujubes, of Violets, which may be given alone or mixed in
any proper water, to which let the decoction of Sebestens, be added.

21. Also a Diacodion may be made after this manner: Take the heads of white
Poppys, ten in number: the ripest fruit of the Crab-tree, one ounce: Myrtles,
six drams: boil them in three pound of water till it come to one pound: sugar
Penids, three ounces being added, boil them to a sufficient thickness. Let him
take either the of the syrups or of this Diacodion a spoonful or two, at the
time of going to bed.

22. But if he rather would dry up the distillation, let him take one scruple
of the Pills of hounds-tongue and out of that make nine pills; three of which
take going to Bed, especially when the distemper is most troublesome, I have
known not a few, who have been Cured by this one Remedy.

23. My third Intention depends upon the second: all Learned Physicians do
acknowledge that fine Bole is is good for all Diseases of the Breast, to which I
agree, if the Bole be taken with the Diacodion above prescribed, whereof you
may lick a little now and then; you may add one dram of the Bole to one ounce
of the Diacodium.

24. Let the Breast be often anointed with the following Ointment: Take the Oil
of sweet Almonds, one ounce and an half: the fat of Hens, one ounce: Saffron,
one scruple; mix them: let him wear a Cloth of three fold on his Breast, and
that will preserve it.

25. Let him sometimes drink the pectoral Decoction of Turnips, made thus: Take
Turnips (the peel or rind being taken away) cut them and putting water to them,
boil them a little: cast away the liquor, and put to them other water, press
out the Juice, to which add a small quantity of fresh Butter and sugar Candy.

26. I have Experimentally found the Virtues and profit of this decoction in
removing Diseases of the Breast, and in dispersing the matter gathered about the
Lungs: as another help, I advise, that you change not often your Physicians nor
Medicines. Laurentius Scholzius, ex Cratone Cons. 21.

LXVII. A Catarrh from the coldness of the Stomach.

1. It is difficult to remove inveterate distillations, yet we must Encounter
them: and in this the usual Circle of Physicians is to be observed, the Head is
often distempered by means of the lower parts, as the Somach, therefore it
should be strengthened and the distillation of the pituitous matter into the
Stomach stopped, that Crudities may be prevented.

2. And that this may be effected, viz. the stoppage of the Defluxions, I would
take every Week or at least every month, twice in half an hour before Supper,
one dram of the Pills of Mastich, and in the Morning I would anoint my belly
with the following Ointment.

3. Take of the Oil of Mastich, one ounce: of the Oil of Spicknard, half an
ounce: of the Oil of Nutmegs, one dram: of the Powder of Mastich, half a dram:
mix them.

4. But that both the Head and Stomach may be helped, in the Morning take to
the bigness of a Chestnut of the following Electuary: Take Diacorus, three
ounces: Calamus Aromaticus condited and cut, one ounce: Clove-gilliflowers cut,
two drams: Species Aromaticum Rosatum, one dram: mix them and make an
Electuary: before he take this Electuary let him in the Morning wash his Mouth
with Sagewater.

5. But since your Reverence has designed to use for the Catarrh and blister in
your Foot, Guajacum and Sarsa parilla; it is first necessary the body be well
Purged, for these Medicines will be almost useless, unless the body be first
well cleansed.

6. Let the humors be prepared by this syrup which, is to be taken for five
days: Take of the Root of Succory, one ounce: Betony, Carduus Benedictus, Paul's
Betony, of each one pugil; boil them in a sufficient quantity of pure water:
take of the Colature four ounces: syrup of Betony, one ounce: honey of Roses,
half an ounce: mix them.

7. When the Humors are preparred, take every other day, thrice, the following
purgative Potion: Take Raisons, one ounce: Hart's-tongue, Pauls-Betony, Carduus,
Benedictus, Betony, Bawm, of each one handful: the Flowers of Borage, Violets,
of each half an handful: the whitest Agarick, six drams: choice Rhubarb, three
drams: Epithymum, the leaves of Sena, of each one ounce: make a decoction in a
sufficient quantity of pure water, press it hard out, and keep it for use. Take
for one draught four ounces thereof mixed with syrup of Roses solutive: syrup
of Apples with Hellebor, of each six drams: Manna the best, half an ounce: mix
them for a Potion for one Dose.

8. When he has been so purged at last he may: Take the Raspings of Guajacum,
one ounce and a half: Sarsa Parillazone ounce: Water, four pound: boil them to
the Consumption of one half according to Art: they being one day beforehand
macerated; let him take six ounces at once: this drink will suffice for four
days.

9. Also every third day let a new decoction be prepared, then use it for
twenty or five and twenty days, with all due Care had both as to sweating and
diet.

10. Boil the Wood twice as also the roots and add fresh Wood and other roots
to the former: for the drink which is to be taken at meals, you may use only
one pound of the Wood to fifteen pounds of the Water, boil it to a third part,
and into the decoction whilst boiling put Raisons; and leaves of Sena, if the
Belly be bound; and Drink of it before Supper. Scholzius ex Cratone, Cons. 23.

LXVIII. A Catarrh with difficult Breathing, Hectic and Consumption.

1. By reason of the distemperature of the Stomach, Distilations are both
freqently and afflicting, from this the Vapors mount up to and seize the Head,
and being there Condensated they fall down on diverse parts, chiefly the Breast
and Shoulders, and least they should procreate greater Evils, We ought to
prevent them timely by the subsequent directions.

2. First, by a digesting potion, which besides the Checking of the defluxion,
does mitigate its acrimony; least it should trouble both Lungs and Breast; it
also cleanses least the matter sticking close to the Stomach should in any
wise offend it.

3. Take syrup of Jujubes, two ounces: Honey of Roses strained, one ounce and
an half: Mint-water, Betony, Bugloss, of each two ounces and an half: mix them,
and take it three Mornings.

4. Secondly, the fourth day at Evening before Sleep, he took the following
Pills: Take Pills of Agarick, Assajareth, of simple Hiera, of each one scruple:
the best Rhubarb, half a scruple: Indian Spicknard, one grain: Diagridium,
three grains and an half: with Violet water make Pills of the biggness of a
white Pea.

5. Thirdly, Rowls which are to be Chewed, three or four times a day: Take
Species, Diatragacanthum frigid, one dram and a half: Aromaticum Rosatum, half
a dram: the best Cinnamon, one scruple: Nutmegs, half a scruple: with Sugar
dissolved in white Rose water make a confect for Rowls.

6. Fourthly, let your Meals be concluded with the following Electuary: Take
conserve of Roses, one ounce: Diacydonium simple, six drams: Nutmegs condited,
number two: red Coral prepared, one scruple: Lozenges of Sugar pearled, one
ounce: with Marmalade of Quinces, make an Electuary. Scholzius Ex Sigismund^,
Cons. 24.

LXIX. A Catarrh with the compression of the Diaphragma.

1. The Catarrh is now very familiar and common to most Men, therefore a good
Diet ought strictly to be observed, which Hippocrates calls the safest Medicine
to Cure this Distemper.

2. A Decoction of Turnips with Butter and Sugar helps much, but if there
should be any flatulency in Turnips it may be corrected by Annise, or by one
small drop of the Oil of Annise.

3. One grain (I suppose rather one scruple) of Frankincense taken at Night
both strengthens and drys.

4. Believe me, that Distemper of the Diaphragma proceeds from flatuous Humors,
which the Juice of Carduus made after the manner of a Syrup, Oxymel, and the
Extract of Calamus Aromaticus does Correct.

5. Anointing with the Oil of Camomil cannot be denied although I fear it will
not do so much good as I could wish.

6. As to Purgation, I cannot advise the use thereof at this season of the
Year: that which in the Spring might have been safely taken, is not convenient,
Winter coming on, all things have their Season; the Spring is the best time.

7. The continual taking of fine Bole Armoniack, prepares the thin
Distillation: you may also take Oil of Vitriol, one drop (yea from two to eight
drops) thereof in the Morning in Broth of Flesh, and particularly Cock and Hen
broth.

8. It will extenuate the pituitous Humors and open the passages of the
Bowels, it prevents rottenness, and much helps moister Bodies: it is seldom to
be administered to persons of a very dry temper. Scholzius ex Cratone, Cons. 27.

LXX. A Catarrh falling upon the Breast.

1. In the Cure of a Catarrh a good Diet is to be kept, which not only consists
in Meats and Drinks, but in Air, Sleep, and in things which Physicians call the
six Non-Naturals, which being moderately taken help much, but on the contrary
being immoderately taken, hurt much.

2. And amongst these are Watchings, Exercises, Venery, etc. to Treat of which
severally, were too tedious: therefore I shall only ennumerate such things as
shall give Ease to the Body, and shall strengthen both Head and Breast.

3. Use for some days, four or five at least, of this following Syrup: Take
Water of Carduus, two ounces and a half: Oxymel simple, one ounce and a half:
Syrup of Violets, half an ounce: mix them.

4. Then let him afterward take the following purgative Medicine: Take
Raisons, five drams: the whitest Agarick, four scruples: Leaves of Sena, five
drams: make a Decoction in a sufficient quantity of pure Water. Take of the
Colature, four ounces: syrup of Roses solutive; the purest Manna, of each one
ounce: mix them.

5. Having taken the Syrup, you may use our Medicament against Coughs, which is
to be put into the Oil of Almonds, at the hour of going to Bed: Take the
bigness of a Chestnut of this Electuary, which will strengthen both the Head
and Memory: Take Conserve of Roses, three ounces: Masculine Frankincense, one
dram and a half: Nutmegs beaten, half a dram: with the syrup of Poppys, mix
them and make a Confection.

6. If you have not a Mind to use this Electuary, you may hold in your Mouth at
Night a little piece of a Nutmeg toasted, and sometimes in the daytime,
because of bad and unwholesome Air.

7. But for this end, there can nothing be more serviceable than the following
Electuary, which you may take in the Morning to the quantity of a Chest-nut:
Take Conserve of Roses, three ounces: the juice of Quinces thickened with Sugar,
one ounce and a half: Bole Armoniack prepared, three drams: with the syrup of
the Juice of Quinces a sufficient quantity, mix them and make an Electuary.
Scholzius, ex Cratone, Cons. 28.

LXXI. A Catarrh upon the Breast and Ventricle.

1. From the Indicative Signs and your Urine, I gather that the Distillations
from your Head, does afflict partly the Head, partly the Stomach, which that
they may be diverted, or rather totally removed, I have Enjoined the following
Remedies.

2. First, the matter is to be resolved, and prepared by a digestive of three
Doses: Take syrups of Stoechas, Hyssop, Jujubes, Oxymel simple, of each one
ounce: Betony-water, Scabious, Horse-hoof, of each three ounces: mix them.

3. Secondly, the fourth day they must be purged: Take the Pills of Agarick,
Pilulae Cochiae, Pilulae aureae, of each one scruple: Diagridium, one grain:
make to the number of sixteen Pills in Betony-Water: Take them fourteen days
together eight Pi^ls at a time.

4. Thirdly, Pectoral Rowls being taken into the Mouth do dilate and moisten
the Windpipe and Lungs, they stop the Catarrh and facilitate Expectoration and
Respiration: Take the species Diareos Salomonis, three drams: Sugar penids, one
dram and an half: White Sugar, six ounces dissolved in Scabious Water: make a
Confection in Rowls.

5. Fourthly, let him anoint the Region of the Ventricle with a Stomachical
Ointment.

6. Fifthly, then after some days apply our Stomachical Plaster.

7. Sixthly, If the Ventricle be in pain, take the following Compounded Powder,
the quantity of one pugil: Take Cinnamon, three drams: Galangal, one dram and a
half: white Ginger, two drams: Mace, two scruples: Clove-gilliflowers, two
drams: Roots of Elecampane, one dram and a half: root of Florentine Orrice, one
dram: Mastich, two scruples: the inner skin of a Hens Gizzard prepared, one
dram: the seeds of Coriander prepared, four drams: Annise, Fennel, of each one
dram and a half: Carraway, Cardamoms, of each half a dram: powder them apart
and mix them, and add to them when they are mixed, the Species Aromaticum
Rosatum, four scruples: Diarrhodon abbatis, one dram: white Sugar, one pound:
mix and make a Tragea. Scholzius ex Naevio, Cons. 30.

LXXII. A thin Catarrh falling upon the Breast and Lungs, with difficulty of
Breathing.

1. If the Catarrh be thin, the syrup of Violets with fine Bole is very
agreeable, as also in all Pectoral Diseases: and that the whole Body may be
strengthened, it being before moderately purged and so much Blood as was
necessary taken away, I gave for that purpose, half a dram of the best
Mithridate.

2. But when the difficulty of breathing is not remitted, the Ventricle, the
Liver and Spleen often perform not their particular Offices; I shall show how
they may be helped and relieved: first, That the matter in the breast may be
attenuated, and the Belly a little moved, there is nothing can be more agreeable
than Oxymel.

3. Let this be the form: Take the Herbs Hyssop, Paul's Betony, Scabious,
Horehound, Origanum, Pennyroyal, Carduus Benedictus, of each one handful;
Roots of Ireos cut, six drams; Ginger, one dram and an half: the best Agarick,
half an ounce: Infuse them in one pound and a half of Vinegar: the Waters of
Paul's Betony, Carduus Benedictus, of each half a pound: let them stand in a
glass bottle stopped close, for three days in some warm place: afterward boil
them on a slow fire, and then let them be pressed out: to one pound and a half
of the expression, add ha^f a pound of the best Honey: boil them again upon a
slow fire: then scum them and put them into a glass bottle; in which you may
also put Cinnamon, Clove-gilliflowers, Calamus Aromaticus pulverized and so
tied up in a Linen cloth, that it may be longer preserved, and the taste made
more pleasant. Let him take of this two or three Spoonfuls, Swallowing it down
by little and little, especially if there be a difficulty of Breathing, or if
the Belly be bound.

4. It will be needful therefore for strengthening the Breast and Lungs, that
in the Mornings the following Syrup be often used: Take the syrup of the juice
of Carduus: the syrup of the Juice of Paul's Betony, of each three ounces: and
the syrup of the juice of Scabious, two ounces: mix them. Let him take two
Spoonfuls and by little and little let it go down.

5. And by reason of the thinner Distillation let him hold in his Mouth these
Rowls: Take fine Bole prepared, half an ounce: with Coltsfoot or Violet-water
and a little of the Mucilage of Tragacanth, make Rowls.

6. Where the more viscid and tough Matter hinders Breathing, let him Swallow
one or two of these Rowls, with the prescribed Syrup; or Oxymel: Take the juice
of Carduus made thick, two ounces: Gum Ammoniacum, with Oxymel, q. s. make
small Rowls.

7. This Potion which he also took, is much commended: Take the seeds of
Faenugreek, Nettles, of each one dram: Basil Royal, half a dram: the leaves of
Mallows, Violets, Pennyroyal, Maidenhair, of each one pugil: Roots of
Marshmallows, Liquorice, of each one dram: dry Figs, to the number of eight:
let them be boiled in two pound of pure Water, add to the Decoction the Honey
of Violets, two ounces: and reduce them to the form of a Syrup. Let him take it
hot in the Morning for three days, so as that the whole Syrup may be divided
into three parts, chiefly when the Cough is very troublesome.

8. When the Air is colder, hold in your Mouth a bit of Nutmeg toasted, when it
is warmer take fine Bole mixed with Rose Water: the best Bole, and not any
thing inferior to that of Armenia may be had in Transylvania at Tokay.

9. As to that Disposition of the Stomach when its Orifice suffers any pain,
the Ancients calls it Cardialgia, which signifies a groaning at Stomach: when
such happens great care is to be had of the Diet, and besides the Swallowing of
grains of white Pepper whole, let him anoint his Stomach with this Ointment.

10. Take the best Olives three ounces: good Wine one ounce: the topps of
Wormwood-gentle, half an handful: the leaves of Spearmint, red Roses, of each
one pugil: let them boil to the Consumption of the Wine, and press them hard
out: and when you have so done add to the expression, the powder of Cloves, one
dram: the Wood of Aloes, half a dram: Mastick, four scruples: the Oil, of
Nutmeg, one dram: make an Ointment: there may be added to it Bread toasted,
sprinkled with the Pouders, of dry Mint, of Cloves and Nutmegs, moistening it
with a little good and pleasant Wine.

11. At the hour of going to bed a grain or two (or rather a scruple) of
Frankincense, with Mastick, you may swallow.

12. Or after dinner, if the pain requires, use this powder: Take white Bread
toasted, two ounces and an half: Coriander praepared, one ounce: Cinnamon, one
dram: powder of Mastich, two scruple: white Sugar, three ounces: mix them, and
make a Tragaea.

13. The coldness of the Ventricle is to be so far helped as that the Liver
which is hot, be not hurt, the Decoction of the roots of Succory in the broth
of a Pullet does not hurt by its frigidity but greatly comforts the Liver: he
may use the flowers of Succory Condited with Suin the Morning.

14. But I fear, they may hurt as well as the sugar of Roses; except a good
orderly Diet be observed, and chiefly that such drink be taken as is agreeable
to the Liver.

15. It is easy to commit an Error in the application of refrigerating
Medicines, whether they be either internally or externally used; when the
Calidity or heat of the Liver, seems to be nothing else than that which is
Natural.

16. Heat to old men, especially if they abound in praeternatural humidity, is
more convenient than cold: But when the sharper fumes are transmitted to the
Head they hurt the Roots of the Hair, and by loosening them they cause them to
fall abundantly; they also alter the color of the Face by making it Redder.

17. Now for fortifying the roots of the Hair, and Contemperating the humors,
the following Ointment will be profitable: Take the Oil of Eggs, half an ounce:
Labdanum or the gum of Ivy, six drams: Bears grease, two drams: Paper burnt,
Filberd-Nuts burned, of each half a dram: powder of Myrrh, one scruple: mix
them and make an Ointment: Let him anoint with this Ointment morning and
evening.

18. Let his Head be washed after Supper, in a Lie, in which Southernwood and
Maidenhair are boiled.

19. And to the same purpose take Goats dung beaten into a powder, and mix it
with the Oil of Eggs, to which add one drop of the Oil of Cloves, or a small
quantity of the Powder thereof, because of its greater efficacy and better
scent.

20. That the redness of the Face may be taken away, first use the most easy
and plain Remedies: some approve of the Juice of sower Apples, the Face being
bathed in the evening with it, and in the morning washd with water, wherein
Almonds and the feeds of Melons are so bruised, that it appears as it were Milk
viz. an Emulsion.

21. But if this does not profit, take one whole Egg and steep it for four days
in the strongest Vinegar, till the shell appear to be much softer, and then
take the white thereof and mix therewith Frankincense, Mastich, Ceruse, of each
one dram: make an Ointment.

22. This Water has been used with great success: Take the Litharge of Silver
praepared, half an ounce: Vinegar, four ounces: Let them boil to the
Consumption of a third part and in another pot boil Salt, Alum, of each half an
ounce: Frankincense, one scruple: Rose water half a pound: let them be mixed
all together and strained through a linen Cloth, and then you shall have a
Milk, to cleanse and heal the Face of red Spots, and by the Virtue of this,
Pushes and Blains may be Cured: it may be used both Morning and Evening.

23. And that the whole Body may be strengthened, I advise that two or three
times every Month, especially when the Air is more cold, you would take of
that excellent Antidote, Treacle or Methridate half a dram, dissolved in
Pauls-Betony water, or water of Cardus Benedictus: the best time for taking of
this is in the Morning, or four hours before Dinner.

24. For the good of the Breast, as well as the Ventricle and Spleen, use
Oxymel, a description of which follows: Take River water, eight pound: the
sharpest Vinegar, one pound: pure Honey, two pound: boil them on a slow fire,
till four pound be Consumed; let them be always Scumm'd: and in the Decoction
put Cinnamon pulverised, two drams: tied up in a rag, which keep in a glass
Bottle. These Medicines I have prescribed for supporting the strength of the
Body, and for weakening those praeternatural Indispositions which do so much
afflict it. Scholzius, ex Cratone, Cons. 79.

LXXIII. A salt Catarrh upon the Lungs.

1. I understand that you are afflicted with a grievous salt Catarrh, which
distills upon the windpipe and Lungs, and is the cause of ulcers in the Lungs,
which are also accompanied by gentle Fevers with a great wasting of the whole
Body.

2. These distillations increase greatly both Spring and Fall for the
inequality of the Air of these seasons; whereby the Bodies that are inclinable
to a Consumption are greatly afflicted, as witnesses Hippocrates, who Calls
Autumn an Enemy to a Consumption, whether you understand it in those that are
actually in a Consumption, or those that have any di^^^sition of body to fall
into that disease.

3. Now to Check those Evil habits, I shall Use this threefold Means: Diet,
Pharmacy and Surgery.

4. Choose your Air temperate in active qualities, or at least of a moderate
Coldness; and in passive qualities, dry: shun an Air that is windy, rainy, or
extreme hot or Cold.

5. Beware of the beams of the Sun and Moon, these increase the distillation,
let the Head and Windpipe be defended by Clothes; that it may not be heat or
cooled to much.

6. Let your Exercise be moderate and without any violence, and endeavor to
Evacuate the superfluities of the Ordure and Urine.

7. Take your sleep at Night, not in the Day, for that is bad: let him Sleep
seven hours at night, with his Head raised and well Covered, at least two hours
after Supper.

8. Let him shun Copulation and the troubles of the mind: let his Bread be of
the purest Wheat, well levened, but without Salt: his Meat of an easy
digestion, and of a good nutriment, having but few superfluities; such as are
Kid, Mutton, Veal, etc. and of Fowls, as Phesants, Quails, Woodcock, etc. But
Fishes are to be avoided.

9. His Bread may be made of Wheat, Barley, Rice, Millet, or Turkey, wheat and
Eggs; but meat at night is not Convenient, because Supper should be much
lighter than Dinner

10. You must not Eat old but new Cheese, and Milk you may take any way, as
boiled with Rice, and rear Eggs.

11. But if you must needs Eat Fish, let them be such as are taken in gravelly
places and are scaly.

12. Garlic, Onions, Leeks, Radishes; Salt and Sour things are to be avoided.

13. Let his Drink be a Decoction of Coriander-seeds sweetened with sugar; as
to the Medicaments to be taken Spring and Fall, let him take this heating
digestive in the morning, for ten days together: Take syrups of Poppies,
Violets, of each two ounces: Violet water, the waters of white Popular-tree,
and Colts foot, of each two ounces: mix them.

14. Let the Body afterward be purged with the following Medicament: Take
choice Manna three ounces: with a pectoral decoction in which must by boyld,
Agarick trochiscated, two scruple.

15. If he spitts Blood, or if he spitts none, yet I, at Intervals, Commend
letting of Blood, in the beginning of the spring at the right Basilica: this
will preserve from spitting of Blood.

16. Morning and Evening (if he spits Blood) let him take Philonium Persicum,
or such a quantity of our Electuary against spitting of Blood, which is a
wonderful thing: Take seeds of white Henbane, white Poppy, of each ten drams:
Terra sigillata, red Coral, of each five drams: old Sugar of Roses, a
sufficient quantity, mix and make an Electuary.

17. Or let him Lick of this Electuary: Take Lohoch of Purslane,
diatragacanthum, fine Bole, of each one ounce: with a sufficient quantity of
the syrup of Poppys, make an Electuary.

18. Some times after going to bed; let him take this Pill for stopping the
Catarrh, and the Blood: Take the Pills of Hounds-tongue, eight grains, make one
Pill: and let the Head be purged by turns with the Pills prescribed in the
former Counsel.

19. Let the Catarrh be diverted with Ligatures and Frictions of the Arms and
Thighs, and by putting Cupping-glasses without scarification to the Buttocks as
also by washing the Legs in this Bath: Take red Roses, the flowers of
Water Lillies, Violets, Betony, Camomil, of each one handful: boil them in a
sufficient quantity of River water, and therewith wash the Legs.

20. By this secure and safe Medicine, the Catarrh is forced back to the
superficies of the Skin of the Head: Take Cantharides, their Wings and Heads
being cut off, one dram: one Fat Figg: a little leaven, Vinegar of squils: make
a past: And the Head being shaven, apply it in the morning to the Coronal
Suture: let it continue for eight hours.

21. When it is sufficiently Blistred, let the water out with an Instrument for
that Use, and anoint the place with Butter, and then lay on a Cole-wort leaf,
heated on the ashes: this must be done Morning and Evening, lest the parts
close.

22. But if this prove Ineffectual, make a Cautery about the beginning of May,
in the Coronal suture, the Hair being Shaven, and the place marked with Ink,
burn it with a hot Iron to the very Pericranium, then dip Flax in the white of
an Egg, with Rose water and Vinegar; afterward for eight hours apply Butter
beaten with a Cole-wort leaf, and so Morning and Evening keep the Plaster till
the Scabb fall off, which being done, put therein a white Pea, and over it an
Ivy leaf, and so the place shall be kept long open.

23. By this remedy many persons Phthisical have been Restored to their former
Health; and though this Medicament may be loathed yet it is most safe, and
stops the distillation of the humors upon the Windpipe.

24. I prescribed in the foregoing Counsel a Restaurative Electuary, of the
flesh of a Capon and Partridge, which Morning and Evening, three or four hours
before meat he should Use to the bigness of a Chestnut.

25. I also advise, that he Drink in May, Asses-milk, Goats-milk, which
although it begets Vapors, yet there can be nothing better to mitigate the
distempers of the Lungs, and a hot and fierce Catarrh, taking at the first four
ounces; and so proceeding by degrees to a pint: mixing it with a little sugar.

26. And that the Milk may not be Corrupted, take a Milch Goat into your
Chamber: after you have drunk the Milk thus ordered, you must not presently
Sleep, nor use any Bodily exercise.

27. Those days he is troubled with a Catarrh: let him take being gently
Purged, one ounce of new Treacle, with the sugar of Roses three or four hours
after supper; then he may Sleep so long as he pleases.

28. Morning and evening he may take the following Electuary, which strengthens
the Lungs against Exulcerating Catarrhs: Take the lungs of a fox prepared and
dried, two ounces: Juyces of Liquorice and Maiden Hair, of each half a dram:
Diapenides with Sugar without the spices: Diatragacanthum frigid. of each one
ounce: with the syrup of Myrtles, a sufficient quantity make an Electuary.

29. In the evening sprinkle the fore part of the Head with this powder. Take
the Gum of Juniper: red Roses, Myrtles, Frankincense, Mastich, red Coral,
Sanders, of each half a dram: make a powder.

30. You must have a Care that the Brain which is the principal Member does
not drive forward the matter to the Lungs.

31. I approve also, for the drying of the members, the Broth of a Land
Tortise, in which let there be boiled clean Barley pressed hard, with white
sugar half an ounce.

32. Morning and Evening anoint the Back bone with this Ointment to be applied
Cold in Summer, but hot in Winter: Take the oils of sweet Almonds, Violets,
fresh Butter washed thrice in Cold water, Mucilage of Fleawort Quinces, of each
half an ounce: the Milk of a Woman that Suckles a Girl, one ounce: with a
sufficient quantity of white wax, make an Ointment.

33. And every morning of those days that he is troubled with a Catarrh, let
him take a large glass of this Water: Take Snail water, Coltsfoot water, of
each three ounces: white Sugar, half an ounce: mix them, and take it warm.
Scholzius ex Hildaeo, Cons. 80.

LXXIV. A Catarrh threatening a strangling or Choking of Children, with an
Epilepsy.

1. Know first, a Catarrh of Infants to arise from multivarious Causes, and
that every Cause requires its peculiar Remedy, which we must search for out of
famous Authors.

2. If we would Cure these distillations it is necessary first of all, That we
take their Mothers or Nurses under our Consideration how they may Govern
themselves, and their Milk may prove good, because for the most part Children
are Indisposed through their Nurses, and the bad government of themselves in
the six Non-Natural things.

3. Afterward the Infants themselves must fall under our Consideration; as,
whether the humor that distills be cold or hot, and so we must help them by
contrary Medicines.

4. We give, if the humor be cold, a drop or two of the syrup of Liquorice, or
some Lohoch of Raisons, dissolved in a little Scabious water, then we sprinkle
the Coronal suture, or seam, with the powder of Sanders.

5. But if we perceive a hot humor, we advise a little of the syrup of Julep,
of Violets, or the Juice of Violets: Or, we make a powder of Penids, Gum
Arabic, Tragacanth and Liquorice beaten, of each a sufficient quantity, and
mix them with the Milk of the Nurse, till they come to the form of a Lohoch, of
which let them swallow a little down at times.

6. When the Indisposition is come to a great hight and it becomes very
Vigorous, I Use to prescribe Sperma Ceti, the quantity of a Pea dissolved in
women's Milk, and then to be poured in the mouth of the Child, which done, to
put the Child to sleep: by this Remedy, I have done much good to many persons,
for it stops the Defluxion, and mitigates the Paroxysms of suffocation; but
this I Use not to give, unless other Medicines avail not.

7. We prevent the Epilepsy by the following Medicine: according to Galen and
other Physicians, we hang about the Neck and Arms of Children, the grains of
Peony hul'd: and a whole Emerald, not broken in any part, we apply to the
Heart: some use red Coral and Elks-hoof.

8. Inwardly we give the Conserve of Peony, and Betony, or we make a
Dissolution of these Conserves in the water of Tile-tree flowers, and of that
we give a little.

9. But to Children of two years old and upwards, the following powder is safe:
Take the Roots of Peony, one ounce: Virginia Snakeroot, half an ounce: Misletoe
of the Oak, half a dram: best English Saffron, one scruple: red Coral, half a
dram: the Roots and seeds of Dittany, of each one scruple: the leaves of pure
Gold cut, to the number of three: Vnicorn-horn, one scruple: Oriential pearl,
half a dram: let them be poudered that are to be poudered, and mix them
together and make a Powder: Dose for an Infant to the quantity of a Pea or two,
in the milk of the Nurse.

10. To those that are Elder give a triple quantity thereof with waters of
Betony, of Tile-tree flowers, and Rue.

11. Pessulls made of Silk dipped in the spirit of wine, in which Castoreum is
dissolved, Eases the present Paroxysm: or the spirit it self put up the
Nostrils, mitigates the accession of the Disease, the best Castoreum effects
the same thing.

12. The humors may be diverted by Frictions, and Ligatures, if age permit.

13. I have seen among the Italians, an actual Cautery applied to the Coronal
Suture of Children of two or three years old.

14. For mitigating the Paroxysm we may Use the foregoing powder; as also the
following: Take the Roots and grains of Peony-huld, of each one scruple: Hearts
horn, the rennet of an Hare, Roots of Tormentil, Misletoe of the Oak, of each
half a scruple: Nutmegs, Cubebs, of each five grains: species Diamoschu dulcis,
half a dram: white Sugar, half an ounce: with the syrup of Staechas a
sufficient quantity; make a soft Confect: Dose the bigness of two Pease, to
them that Suck, and to those that are Elder a greater quantity may be given.
Scholzius ex Nevio, Cons. 309.

LXXV. A Child having a Catarrh with a Suffocating Cough.

1. When he has a hard Cough, and is in danger of suffocation, it is a sign the
Catarrh has seized on his Breast and Lungs; and as the Stomach is purged by
Vomit, so is the Breast by a Cough, if the matter of the Catarrh be thin.

2. It is for the most part dangerous in Children, who often by Coughing and
swallowing down that which they bring up, and in the very struggling, cause the
Catarrh to descend with the greater violence, even almost to the very stopping
of the Breath, whereby they make those distillations more durable.

3. Therefore agreat Care must be had that the too moist temperature of the
Brain be Corrected, and the Breast strengthened and a good diet observed.

4. This last is the first thing to be Regarded in the Cure, as also Air,
sleep, and purgation of the Excrements.

5. As to diet let one meal be digested before you Eat another: let the times
of eating be observed, it is enough to Eat thrice a day: Let your meat be
plain, and be Content with one or two dishes; For variety of Dishes, breeds
variety of Diseases, a difficulty of Breathing and Crudities, which are great
nourishers of the Catarrh.

6. You must also forbear the use of such things as send many Vapors to the
Head: all fruits almost, (Except straw-berries) which bind the Belly, and
Cherries, which when they are sower not only bind the Belly, but hurt the
Breast, all things made of or boiled in Milk, Pot Herbs, Eggs fried with
Butter, and Crabfish.

7. Let him use the broth of flesh, wherein Almonds and Prunes are boiled,
especially if the Belly be bound.

8. Things loosening are to be taken before your other meat: pot herbs although
they cause a Repletion of the Head, yet when the person is Costive, these with
Spinag, Raisons, and Sugar may be Eaten; I do not condemn rear-Eggs, for being
taken with Sugar, they help to Expectorate the Humors.

9. Let him Eat boyld and roasted Veal; I do not approve either of Swines or
Lambs flesh, for their too great Moisture: but Capons, Hens, Pullets,
Partridges, Wood-Cocks, and all Fowls of the Mountains and Woods, I allow, if
they be not too often Eaten, and be made a constant diet, omne nimium et Varium
Naturae adversum est.

10. You may after flesh eat Barley and Rice well boiled: or at first sitting
down at table, Barley-broth: and a Child must abstain from Drink till he has
first Eaten some solid meat. Let him drink pure Beer or water boiled in which a
few grains of Coriander prepared or a little Cinnamon is put, let him refrain
Wine to the twelfth year of his Age.

11. After meat, let him eat a roasted Pear, with Ani-seed and sugar, and some
of the Confection of the Juice of Quinces, especially of the flesh of Quinces.

12. Let the Child afterward walk moderately, for vehement Exercises fills the
Head much; let him not sleep till three or four hours after dinner or supper,
nor in a moist place, or a place that is Vaulted over Head, nor with the
Windows open, especially in the Night time, let him always avoid a cold and
moist Air, and walking with his Head uncovered.

13. When he rises in the Morning, first lightly Rubb his Body with soft
Clothes, beginning at his Feet, and afterward his back and arms; then let him
make his Head clean with a Comb, and wash his Mouth with pure water, in which
the root of Calamus aromaticus is Infused.

14. Afterward you may take every other day either a Lozenge of Diaireos
simple, which you may find in the Dispensatory, or the Juice of Calamus
Aromaticus, thus, prepared. Take a quarter of a pound of the roots of Calamus
Aromaticus cut in small pieces, pour to them pure Water, made warm to the
degree of a Natural hot Bath: boil them to the Consumption of one third part,
let them he strained hard out, add to that which is strained out, half a pound
of Sugar and boil them to the thickness of a syrup: then let him take in the
Morning a small spoonful.

15. Now that the Matter may be expurgated by the Nostrils, let him anoint his
Nostrils with the Ointment following, in the Morning within, in the Evening
without: Take the Oil of sweet Almonds and put to it Hens fat, sweet Marjoram
bruised, and so boil them and strain them, and let them be kept for Use in a
Glass.

16. Some times in the morning the Nostrils being dry they may be Rubbed hard
with the Powder of Majoram, having had the benefit of nature; and that he may
sneeze let him look up to the Sun; but this I advise to be seldom done.

17. I prescribe no purging Medicines to Children, yet if the Catarrh be
extreme troblesom and afflict the Breast, you may take a spoonful of the
following Electuary: Take the Choicest Manna, one ounce: sugar Penids, one
ounce and an half: Oil of sweet Almonds, six dram: Oxymel simple, syrup of
Violets, of each half an ounce: mix them.

18. Sometimes let there be given an hour before supper, half an ounce of this:
Take Conserve of Roses, half an ounce ^ the flowers or pulp of Cassia newly
Extracted, one ounce: mix them: This mixture is for three Doses.

19. But as I said, I would not have Children accustomed to purgative
Medicines, but rather that about the time of going to Bed and in morning
sometimes he drink a decoction of Turnips which is to be prepared thus: Take
fresh Turnips pared, boil them in water; throw away the Broth after the first
Decoction, and pour in fresh water, let them boil till they grow soft, then add
a sufficient quantity of sugar Candy, and fresh Butter, to sweeten it; give
this decoction to the Child frequently Morning and Evening in Winter.

20. Wash his Feet also in Beer, and Rub them warm with the Fat of a pike.

21. If yet the Catarrh continues still violent upon the Breast, after the Head
is a little moistened with Majoram water, sprinkle thereon the following
powder: Take red Coral, Myrtles, red Roses, of each half a dram: Mastich, white
Succory, of each half a scruple: mix them and make a powder: Bind then also
strongly the Arms, and rub the Feet with warm Clothes.

22. But I hope if what I have already prescribed be duly administered and the
order in Diet, and other things observed, there will be no great need of these.

23. Let him carry about his Neck Hyacinths: and if you apprehend any danger by
Meat or Drink that has been taken, the following Powder is good: Take
Harts-born, one dram: Coral both sorts, of each two scruples: Emeralds prepared
one scruple: Bezoar-stone, half a scruple: leaves of Gold, to the number of
nine: mix them, and make a Powder: which may be taken in the Emulsion of Citron
seeds, in Carduus water.

24. There may be Lozenges made of that powder dissolved with sugar in Cinnamon
water, whereof the Child may take one every morning: Scholzius, ex Cratone,
Cons. 310.

LXXVI. A sharp Catarrh which caused an hole in one of the Veins under the
Tongue.

1. A certain man by reason of a sharp Catarrh which did continually flow into
his Throat, one night began to spit a great quantity of Blood which came from
his Mouth.

2. Search being made after the place whence the Blood came, an hole was found
in one of the Veins under the Tongue, which was eaten out by a fretting humor,
so large that it equalliz'd a Lentil grain, out of which plentiful streams
issued for two days together, in such abundance, as to amount to the Weight of
twenty pounds.

3. Into the hole We put small Tents like Pine Kernels, made of Gypsum, Gum
Arabic, Aloes, Frankincense, Dragons blood, fine Bole, the hairs of an Hare
very finely poudered, and Blood stone, with the white of an Egg.

4. Revelling Medicines were administered, and other things which have a power
or faculty to coagulate and thicken the Blood.

5. By all which, nor yet by Narcoticks, when the bleeding could not be
stopped: by an Actual Cautery, applied to the sole of the Foot, in like manner
it was wholly stopped. And nature stopped up the hole by help of Sarcoticks which
breed new flesh. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 66.

LXXVII. A Catarrh, feaveral Epidemicall, Anno. 1658.

1. In respect of the preceding violent frost of the Winter and the succeeding
Immoderate heat of the Summer, no one living could remember such a year the
Excesses of heat and cold being both so extreme.

2. From the Ides of December, almost to the vernal Equinox the Earth was
covered with Snow, and the North Wind constantly blowing, all things were
Frozen: Also, afterward from the beginning of the spring to the beginning almost
of June, the Wind being still in the same Corner, the season was more like
winter then spring; unless now and then a hot day happened between.

3. While the Winter continued (unless that a Quartan Fever contracted in
Autumn Infected some) among our Countrymen, there was a moderate state of
Health and freedom from Popular Diseases.

4. The Spring coming on an Intermitting Tertain (as used to do every year
before) fell upon some.

5. About the end of April, a Distemper arose suddenly, as if sent by some
Blast of the Stars, which laid hold on very many together, that in some Towns
in the space of a Week, about a thousand people fell sick.

6. The particular Symptom of this disease, and which first afflicted the Sick
was a troublesome Cough accompanied with great Spitting, and a Catarrh falling
down upon the Palate, Throat and Nostrils; as also a feverish Distemper Joined
with heat and thirst, want of aptite, a spontaneous weariness, and a grievious
Pain in the Back and Limbs.

7. But the Fever was so remiss in some, that they could go abroad and follow
their affairs in the time of their sickness, yet complaining in the Interim of
want of strength, and of languishing, a loathing of Food, a Cough and a Catarrh.

8. In some a very hot Distemper plainly appeared, that being thrown into bed,
they were troubled with Burning, Thirst, Waking, Hoarsness, and Coughing, and
that scarcely without any Intermission.

9. Sometimes there came upon this a bleeding at the Nose, and in some a
Bloody-spittle and frequently a Bloody Flux; and those who were taken with this
disease, being of an Infirm body and a decaying Age, not a few died of it, but
the more strong, and almost all of a healthful Constitution Recovered.

10. Those who of this disease sickned and died, for the most part died by
reason of the strength being leasurely wasted, and serous heap more and more
gathered together in their Breast, with the Increase of the Fever and the
difficulty of breathing, like those sick of an Hectic Fever.

11. We are to Enquire concerning this Disease, what Procatartick cause it had;
that it should suddenly arise in the middle of the spring, and almost the third
part of manking should be distempered with the same, in the space of a Month:
then the signs and symptoms being carefully Colected, the formal Reason of this
disease as also its Crisis and way of Cure ought to be Assigned.

12. It is Known by Common Experience, as well as by the Testimony of
Hippocrates that the Northern Wind is most apt to produce Catarrhs: but why the
Catarrhs did not spread at least in some peculiar places, all the Winter and
Spring, but only in one Months space, and then Joined with a Fever? and that
this distemper should become Epidemical, does not so plainly appear.

13. I know many deduce the Cause from the unequal temper of the air at that
time which although for the most part very Cold, yet the North wind sometimes
lessening, there would be a day or two very hot between: wherefore from this
occasion as from Cold taken after heat, men Commonly fall sick.

14. But indeed for Exciting the distemper, so suddenly rising and commonly
spreading, there is required, besides such an occasion, some great precedent
Cause, or Predisposition, though the other perhaps might suffice for an evident
Cause, for to afflict them with this Distemper.

15. We ought to suppose that all men almost were prone and inclinable to this
Disease, otherwise no Evident Cause could have Exercised its Power so potently
on so many, wherefore it seems very likely that this sickness had its Origin
from the Intemperance and inordination of the year; and as the Autumnal
intermitting Fever going before was the product of the preceding immoderate
heat, so this Catarrhal Fever, depended altogether upon the following part of
the year, being so extremely Cold.

16. For the blood being fermented by the very hot Summer and Inclinable to the
Fever before described, then being made more sourish by the Urgency of the
Autumn, and apt for a Quartan Fever, after wards being a little Eventilated by
reason of the strong Cold of the Winter, and hindered from its due
Perspiration, Returned yet its discrasy or Evil disposition, and readily broak
forth on the first occasion given.

17. Wherefore when the blood in the middle of the Spring, (as the Juice of
Vegetables) being made more lively, and also began to Flower and grow Rank, by
reason of the continued stoppage, was straightened in its Circulation, and easily
made prone to a Feverish Effervescency: and as the serous water redounding in
the blood, could not Evaporate outwardly because of the Pores being still
straightned by the Cold, Restagnating within, and chiefly falling upon the
Lungs, (where it might be moved about, instead of an outward breathing forth)
Excited so frequent and troublesem a Cough.

18. The original therefore, and formal Reason of this Disease, are founded
chiefly upon two things; viz. That there happened together a greater
Effervescency of the blood than Usual, from the coming on of the Spring, and
also a stoppage or great Constriction of the Pores, Excited by the too great
cold of the foregoing Season, that therefore there was not a free space granted
to the blood flowing or Luxuriating in the Vessels: the business being after
the same manner as if wine began to grow hot, should be put into vessels
Closely shut up, for by this means, either the Vessels or the liquor were in
danger to be lost.

19. Wherefore, to be Concise; the Cause that this Disease began in the middle
of the Spring, having presently spread largely, seized very many, was not the
blast of a malignant Air, whereby the Sick were distempered, as if struck with
a blasting, but at this time, the blood being Inspired by the Constitution of
the Spring, and so Luxuriating and apt to grow hot, was Contracted or
straitened in its motion and the Effluvies being constrained inwardly, could
not be sufficiently Eventilated, or cooled.

20. Every year, tho temperate, it is usual in the Spring and Autumn for some
Epidemical Diseases to Reign, because at this time, the blood being as it were
Restored, Flowers a new; and therefore, Intermitting Fevers and sometimes the
small Pox ordinarily spread in this season.

21. Wherefore, it is no wonder, after a great unequal Constitution of the year,
and not Natural, when in the Spring the blood boiling up more lively within the
Vessels, by Reason of transpiration being hindered, could not be freely
Circulated and sufficiently Eventilated, if for that Cause great disorders
follow, and from this most common Cause, a distemper greatly Epidemical should
be excited.

22. As to the Symptoms Joined with this Disease, a Feverish Intemperature,
and whatsoever belongs to this, the heat of the Praecordia, Thrist, a
spontaneous Weariness, pain in the Head, Loins, and Limbs were induced from the
blood growing hot, and not sufficiently eventilated.

23. Hence in many, a part of the thinner blood being heated, and the rest of
the Liquor being only driven into Confusion, a simple synochus, or Fever of
more days was Caused, and this for the most part ceased within a few days.

24. But in some endued with a vicious disposition of blood, or evil habit of
body, this kind of Fever arising from the same Cause, quickly passed into a
very dangerous putrid Fever and often Mortal.

25. The Cough accompanying the Fever with a Catarrh, draws its Origin from a
serous humor, heaped together in the blood by reason transpiration was hindered
for a long time, and then an Effervescency being risen, droping forth more from
the little Arteries gaping within: for when the Pores are restrained, the
superfluous serosities in the blood, being wont to evaporate outwardly, are
poured fourth on the Lungs, by a proper Castration or Cleansing of the blood,
wherefore by taking Cold (as they usually call it) that is, from Transpiration
outwardly being hindered for a long time, the Cough for the most part is
stirred up.

26. And for a foregoing Cause to this Distemper, the flowing forth of the
Serum, into the mass of blood; has for the most part the chief place.

27. For from the cold hindering the scorching of the Blood or the provision of
the Bile, and prohibiting the Breathing forth of the watery humor, there was a
necessity, that very much of the serous humor should be heaped up in the Blood.

28. Wherefore, when the Blood flowing in the Spring, conceived an heat, the
flowing forth of the Serum, and a pouring of it on the Interior parts, was
wont to Cause first the Cough as the proper symptom of this Disease.

29. And those whose Blood was more dilut^^ed by the mixtion of the Serum, and
who were greatly obnoxious to the Cough and a Rhumatick Disease, were Cured
with less trouble of the feverish Distemper.

30. The Prognostic of this disease concerning private persons, is for the
most part easy, that one may deliver the Event from the first Assault: for if
this sickness be Excited in a strong Body and before Healthful, and that the
Feverish Distemper be moderate, and without any grivous and horrid symptom,
the business is free from danger, and the distemper is to be accounted of no
great Moment, as that commonly is of catching cold, neither needs a Physician
be Consulted, nor Remedies, unless that which is trivial and ordinary be
Administered.

31. But if this Distemper happens in a weak and sickly Body, or with a bad
provision, or that the Fever being transmitted into a Putrid Fever or the
Cough growing grievous, Induces difficult Breathing, and as in were a Tabid and
Consumptive disposition, the event of the disease is much to be suspected, and
often terminates in death.

32. The common Prognistick that was taken from hence concerning the future
state of the year, contains nothing to be feared, or ominates any great ill.

33. By reason of the unequal temperature of the year, the great heats and then
excessive Cold, we might fear Diseases to arise from the discrasy of the Blood,
yet we need neither from the present Condition suspect any notable deprivation
of the Air, or Infection with poisonous Breaths; that from thence may be had
any Judgment of the plague or Malignant disease to be at hand.

34. As to what belongs to the Cure, when this disease is more lightly
Inflicted, its Cure for the most part is left to nature: for this Fever when
it is only a simple Synochus, is wont to be Cured within a few days by a
sweat: wherefore by a copious sweating the third or fourth day, for the most
part the heat and thirst, the weariness and heavy pains are allayed, then the
Cough being longer protracted, by little and little afterward Remits, and at
legnth the sick leisurely grows well.

35. If this Disease has rooted it self more deeply, there is need of fit
Remedies and an exact method of Curing, the Fever growing worse is to be
healed, according to the Rules to be observed in a putrid Fever: but with this
difference never the less, that because transpiration being hindered, and the
suffusion of the serous humor on the Lungs are chiefly in fault, therefore
Diaphoretick and pectoral remedies are of more frequent use, for these Restrain
the flowing of the Serum from the vessels within, or by opening the Pores
convey it forth of doors, or precipitating it from the bosom of the Blood, send
it forth by the Urinary passages.

36. Therefore the method of Medicine for this Disease, being brought into the
worser sort; Respects both the feverish Intemperance; for curing, which you
are to be directed according to the Intentions shown in the putrid Fever, and
also the Rhumatick distemper, which letit be secondary, and not every
expectorating remedy: or those used against a Cough are to be admitted however,
but of that kind only, which do not increase the Fever.

37. The forms of these, and the means of Curing, are to be sought from the
precepts generally delivered for the Cure of the putrid Fever and of the Cough.

38. The helps which now by frequent Experience are commonly said to Effect a
Cure of this Disease, are sweating or provoking of sweat, and letting of Blood:
For the vessels being emptied by this or that means, both the immoderate heat
of the Blood, and the abundance of the Serum are Restrained. Willis de
Febribus. cap. 17.

LXXVIII. A Catarrh badly Cured.

1. A delicate and religious Maid, tall and slender, begot of a sickly Father,
and obnoxious to the most grievous Distempers of the nervous kind, about twenty
years of Age, was troubled for many days with the Headache, very cruel and
Periodical; at length at the time of the Winter Solstice: 1656. the Pain of her
Head ceased, but instead of it a mighty Catarrh followed with a thin and
plentiful Spitting, as also an ulcerous Distemper of the Nose and Throat.

2. After she had for some time endured this affliction, by the prescript of a
certain Woman receiving the Fume of Amber by a Funnel into her Mouth, she was
suddenly, Cured, viz. the Catarrh or violent Rhume ceased suddenly, but from
thence she complained of a notable Vertigo, with a Pain in the Head and a
tingling noise in the Ears.

3. On the third day, the tendons of the hinder part of the Neck were pulled
together, that her Head, was bended forward, and sometimes backward, and of one
side, sometimes it continued still and unmovable.

4. After a while the same kind of Convulsive distemper invaded the outward
Members and Limbs of the whole Body, her Arms and Hands were wonderfully turned
about, that no Jugler or Tumbler could imitate their bendings and rollings
about; she was necessitated to spread abroad her Legs and Feet here and there,
to strike them against one another, and to transpose and Cross them by turns.

5. After this manner either sitting or lying she was afflicted perpetually
with these Convulsive motions, unless taken with Sleep, and when she did a
little restrain her members from the great labor of the Muscles, she was taken
presently with a difficult and short Breathing with a sense of Choking; but in
the Interim, her Eyes Jaws, Mouth and inferior Bowels remained free from any
Convulsion; neither was she troubled with a Vomiting, Belching, nor any
Inflation of the Belly, or Hypocondria.

6. Besides, she had still the use of her Reason, Memory and Phantasy, she
spoke nothing foolishly: but in these admirable Evils, she showed wonderful
Examples of Christian Fortitude and Patience, with pious and godly Speeches.

7. Her Appetite was soon lost, for she took meat very unwillingly: she
thirsted still, and her strength was grown so feeble, that she could neither
stand or walk, her Urine was of a Citron Color, full of saltness, on whose
superficies grew little Tartarous Skins.

8. When on the sixth day of her sickness, I was sent for to this Gentlewoman,
I framed the Aetiology, of this kind of admirable distemper; For the
Consideration of her Fathers being Sick of most grievous Convulsive passions,
kept me, that I did not with many others Refer all things to the delusions of
Witches.

9. Wherefore, that I might find out the natural Causes of these Symptoms, it
was in the first place to be suspected that this Gentlewoman had hereditarily
Contracted the seeds of Convulsive Distempers, which, about the Flower of her
Age, broke forth in this kind of Fruit.

10. For when her Blood was much Imbibed with heterogeneous and explosive
Particles, they at length (as is want in such a disposition) began to be poured
into the Head, and there to be fixed.

11. Being therefore first deposited in the Meningae, they induced the great
Periodical Headache; then afterward the same matter having accidentally shifted
its place, falling down into the sinks of the Throat and Mouth changed the
Cephalalgia or Headache, into a Catarrh or Rhume.

12. And lastly, when by an untimely use of the remedy, the defluxion stopped,
the morbifick matter flowing back into the Brain, brought the Vertigo, and then
being thrust forth on the Nervous stock, it excited the aforesaid Convulsive
Affections.

13. As to the formal Reason or the means of Generation, whereby the Convulsive
Matter falling down into the nervous stock, did produce these admirable
Symptoms, we may lawfully suppose, that the same being thrust forth from the
Confines of the Head, being yet more firm, into the Spinal Marrow, and its
Appendix, and being like a Malignant ferment, it first Infected with
heterogeneous and Explosive Particles, these parts of the juice watering the
whole Mass, which cleaving to the Spirits, every where disposed through their
whole series and agitating them, as it were with a certain fury, did stir them
up with continual Explosions.

14. When in truth the nervous juice, as is said, was so fermented by the
flowing in of the Convulsive Matter, that which did otherways water the
containing parts, with a gentle falling on them, and through the same, did pass
over the Animal spirits with an equal Expansion; now the same did torment the
Nervous Fibers, with various Contractions, and Corrugations, or shrinking up.

15. And both the spirits flowing in, being too much Burdened with an
Heterogeneous Copula from their due Irradiation, and also variously moving
those Implanted in every part, did Incite them as it were with a Diabolical
Inspiration, so that no more obeying the Empire of the Will, they ran into
inordinate Motions, and did renew them, translated rapidly here and there with
a perpetual Reciprocation.

16. But although the Heterogeneous particles being poured forth with the
Blood, into the Brain, and thence thrust forth into the nervous Stock, did not
enter rightly the beginings of all the Nerves, but chiefly and almost only the
spinal Marrow and its nervous shoots; so that the internal Vicera, also the
parts of the Eyes, Mouth and Face, remained free from any Convulsion, whereby
it entered less in the outward members, presently like wildfire, a way being
found, it was wont to run into the Precordia and Bowels of the lower Belly:
viz. because the inflowing Spirits, being struck with a certain fury and
requiring a larger place, in which they might exercise their Madness being
excluded from one place, presently entered another some where open.

17. Wherefore, if that fury had been repulsed both from the Members and the
Viscera, no doubt it would have flown back on the Brain, and brought thither
Madness, or, as it were an Epileptical Insensibleness: which Symptoms happened
to be wanting, for that the Brain of this most Ingenious Gentlewoman, being
endued with a more firm Constitution, did take from the nervous Liquor freshly
Instilled, whatsoever was Cengruous and Spiritous, for its proper Food and
enjoyed it.

18. In the mean time it did depress all the Morbisick Particles, into the
Spinal marrow, by which the Involuntary motions of the members were Excited
after that manner as we said but now.

19. Being Requested to undertake the Cure of this worthy Virgin, first a light
preparation of Body being made, I gave her a solutive potion of the Infusion of
Sena and Rhubarb, with yellow Sanders and salt of Wormwood added to it, by
which she was purged 12 times with great ease.

20. The next day I took eight ounces of Blood from her left Arm: and every
evening I gave her an Opiate of the Water, and Syrup of the flowers of
Lungwort, with the Powder of Pearls; besides once within six hours I prescribed
her to take a Dose of the Spirits of Hearts horn in a draught of the following
Julep: Take of the waters of black Cherries, of Walnuts, and of the flowers of
Peony, each three ounces: of the Antipeleptick, of Langius, two ounces: of the
syrup of the flowers of male Peony, two ounces: of the powder of Pearls, one
scruple: mix and make a Julap.

21. Because she could not endure much Purging Clysters with sugard Milk, were
made use of frequently besides an Antipasmodick Ointment, being applied to the
hinder part of the Neck and the Back bone.

22. We ordered rubbing of the distemperd members with warm woollen clothes,
wetted in proper Oil: By the use of these, the sick person within six days,
seemed to be very much helped; for the Convulsive Motions almost wholly ceased,
and she could contain her Members quietly in their due position, only her Head
sometimes by a lighter contraction was Compelled to bend gently this and that
way; she was able to stand a little and rise out of her Chair, but when she
went to step forward, she went not rightly but obliquely.

23. At this time, going away, I left her much better, and in a way of
Recovery, but after another Week, the North wind being high, and arisen in the
night, and the Window not being fast shut, blew very much on the sick person,
and taking Cold thereby, relapsed into that kind of Condition that she became
Obnoxions not only to Convulsive Passions, but to an universal Periodical Palsy.

24. For, after that she was forced to move about turn and Wind variously all
her Limbs successively, with her Head and members by turns, bent and thrown
about here and there (as before) from Morning to Night: till these kind of
motions ceasing at Night, a Resolution of her members or palsy succeeded, so
that she was not able to stir any part of her Body, so lying in her Bed almost
immovable, like a stone.

25. But being a little refreshed with sleep, about morning, as she Received
some little Strength or Virtue of the regular Motive faculty, though but weakly
by bending her Arms, and Legs, so also the Involuntary and Convulsive motions
did constantly return, enduring from that time all the day, which again at the
Evening, were changed into these Resolutions of the Limbs.

26. By these, it appears that the Gentlewoman labored with a twofold Disease,
viz. a Palsy and Convulsion, and that the material Cause of either, was
somewhat distinct.

27. For it seems that the Animal spirits every where abounding, being burdened
with Narcotick Particles, were almost continually bound: Besides that, in the
time of Sleeping, together with the Nervous Juice, the Convulsive particles
plentifully flowing in, did cleave also to the Spirits, for the Explosions of
which, the Spirits being Incited produced the Involuntary motions.

28. But also at that time, the Narcotick copula being somewhat shaken off:
they were then able in some sort to perform the volontary or regular also.

29. Besides the Remedies now Recited, they Carefully administered many others,
almost of every kind, viz. Antiscorbuticks, Antiparaliticks, decoctions,
Sudorificks, distilled waters, spirits, Elixirs, Tinctures, Baths, Liniments,
with many others, by the use of which, the symptoms were something remitted,
but yet the Disease was not wholly Cured.

30. The universal Palsy soon Ceased, that she was able at any time to move her
Limbs and to bend them here and there; and also the Involuntary motions did
trouble her but rarely, yet she continued weak and Languishing; and being of a
more fine temper and prone to a Consumption, because transpiration was hindered,
the Recrements of the Blood being laid up in the Lungs brought in a Cough,
which every day growing worse, she at length died of a Phthisis, or Wasting.

LONDON, Printed for Th. Dawks, and L. Curtiss.

The Chapter of the Catarrh continued. Numb. 50

LXXIX. Remedies for a Catarrh, out of the Epistles collected by Scholzius.

1. Crato in an Epistle to Jordan. If the Catarrh be thin, you must consult the
general Method of Cure. If the matter of the Catarrh be mixed, the Curative
Indications are to be mixed. However where the matter is thin, or may endanger
Suffocation, nothing is more profitable than Pilulae de Cynoglessa, a scruple
to be taken at a time at going to bed made into nine Pills: In a Salt Catarrh,
a Bolus is profitable made of the Powder Diatragacanthum with Syrup of Poppies.
If the matter of the Catarrh is mixed, Diacodium is the most profitable
Medicament: and Paul's Betony given in gross Powder. ScholZij, Epist. Med. 155.

2. Crato to the same Man. If a thin Catarrh begins to grow thick, give Oxymel
Compound, one ounce in Decoction of Foenugreek, or in Broth: It will cleanse
the Breast by Spitting forth, and may also gently move the Bowels: Then give
the Syrup of Carduus with Extract of Calamus Aromaticus to comfort the Stomach.
If he begins to expectorate, give constantly a Decoction of Calamus Aromaticus
sweetened with Sugar or Honey. Or, a Decoction of Faenugreek with Figs, and such
like. Scholzij, Epist. Medic. 156.

LXXX. A Catarrh falling on the Breast and Stomach.

1. A certain Gentleman toward Evenings was afflicted with a Catarrh on his
Breast and Stomach, in so much, That his Speech was lost, and his Heart and

LXXXVII. Of the mighty power of Tobacco, observed in Curing Catarrhs.

1. There is no Plant in the World for its many excellent Virtues in removing
all kinds of diseases, both internal and external, that deserves such an Elogy
as Tobacco; especially in Catarrhs and Rhumes, the fume and powder thereof
being exhibited; its Fume satisfies the Appetite and removes hunger; by the
virtue of this Plant persons have fasted three or four days without any
discernable hurt.

2. It is fit then to enquire into the Cause of such a strange Effect, seeing
it appears somewhat disagreable to reason, that any alliment should be conveyed
to the Stomach from its fume.

3. Nicholas Monardus, a Spaniard tells you, the Indians sometimes wandering in
the desert places, and wanting food, have deceived their craving appetites by
Chewing the bigness of a large Pea of Tobacco, and have continued a Journey of
four days without Meat or Drink, and yet without any sense of hunger and
thirst, and ascribes the Cause of this to a watery kind of phlegm drawn from the
Head, by the Operation of Tobacco, which being swallowed, serves instead of
Nourishment.

4. But a more occult Cause may be assigned than this, viz. a certain (...) or
stupefactive quality, making an impression upon the mouth of the Stomach; which
inables the person to abstain from Meat and Drink till its Energy is spent, and
then the Appetite returns.

5. The root thereof mixed with the Conserves of Roses and Violets, has been
given to extinguish Thirst; and it is not unlikely it can produce this effect;
For there are little Nerves belonging to the Jaws which reach the mouth of the
Stomach, which being stupifyed there remains no sense of Appetite: Thoneri,
lib. 2. Observe. 3.

ascribed the Cure these kinds of defluxions to such grievous and tormenting
Instruments: not that I would be thought to disaprove and condemn altogether
the use of Cauteries, but they are not to be exhibited promiscuously to all and
every kind of disease, experience it self evidently confirms it.

3. In the Cure of this Person, we gently opened his Belly twice or thrice in a
day with Melanagogues, and we unlockt by Diaphoreticks, the Pores of his Skin,
that were shut up and constipated, and to the Members, being wearied and
defatigated we applied corroborating and strengthening things, which we shall
not here mention, because they are well enough known and plainly manifest in
other Cures. Poterij Cent. 1. Observe. 25.

XCIX. A Catarrh with the loss of Hearing.

1. A certain Gentleman called Petrus Martyr Lucatellus, was afflicted with
three sorts of Diseases, and all of them very grievous; the first of these
affects was a frequent distilla-of Rhume from the head, descending on the Jaws
and Lungs, which did cause a Continual Cough, a difficulty of breathing, and
the Almonds of the Ears, the Larynx and Oesephagus being swelled, it did cause
an Incapacity of speaking.

2. The second affect, was such a tingling and sound in the Ears, that the
Hearing was almost lost: The third, was a slow but continual Fever with a
signal decay of strength.

3. Several famous Physicians undertook to stop and resist this great
distillation, and to that end, they Administered often Potions and Pills for
purging the whole Body, and did draw Blood to the quantity of a pound out of
his Arm.

4. Having received no benefit by these things, another Purgation was repeated,
although the Winter was exceeding cold; afterward they ordered another pound of
Blood to be taken out of the Veins under the Tongue, Cupping glasses, with
Scarifications were applied to the nape of the Neck, and the Shoulders, and out
of the Salvatella, there was not a little Blood drawn.

5. But all these applications were to no purpose; For the Disease continuing
always stubborn and obstinate and the strength of the Patient for the most part
consumed; he threw himself into my Hands for a Cure.

6. We did propose to our selves in order to the subduing of so many Evils,
these three Indications: First, to bring down those fierce Humors, that had
got upwards from the lower parts; which a gentle, mild and continued purgation
did Effect.

7. Secondly, to strengthen and supply with proper Medicines these Powers which
were debilitated by the distemper; such is our Diaphoretick Gold.

8. Thirdly, to overcome the Fever, and all symptoms from thence arising, and
to restore Nature again to its former state; and to that purpose we did make
use of our Alexipyritum, the Essence of Coral, and other proper Medicines, by
which this Gentleman in the space of one month was perfectly Cured. Poterius,
Cent. 1. Observe. 97.

C. A Salt, stubborn and Malignant Catarrh.

1. A certain Gentleman about forty years old; being destitute of help
notwithstanding all the Medicines which were applied by several Physicians; we
at last took him in hand, giving him much safer Remedies then had been
prescribed him.

2. I was of the Opinion, That this Salt malignant continual Catarrh did
proceed from the Liver and Spleen, as the fountain and original thereof; and
these from a bad Diet, and the pravity of them to be increased by the bad
Medicines which were applied.

3. I began the Cure of this person with a stomachal specific, by which the
Obstructions of the Visera being unstopt, we prescribed the Decoctum
Melanagogum and Cholagogum, for twenty days, in which time he Recovered his
perfect Health.

4. The Decoction may be made as follows: Take Sena, Epithymum, Dodder,
Polypody, of each two ounces: black Hellebor, one ounce: Cassia extracted,
Tamarinds, of Rhubarb, Prunes, of each three ounces: Violets, an ounce and
half: boil in Water a sufficient quantity with a few drops of Oil of Sulphur;
sweeten, strain out and keep it for use. Poterius, Cent. 2. Observe. 14.

CI. An Inveterate Catarrh of two years standing, from a great weakness of the
Nerves.

1. An Illustrious Person 24 years of Age, fell into a most grievious and
dangerous defluxion of the Head, from whence descending into the left side, did
generate a signal impotency in the Arm, lower part of the Spina, Thigh and Foot
of the same side.

2. He did use the advice of several Physicians in vain; For the usual
purgations, phlebotomy and the like, the decoctions of Guajacum, Sarsa Parilla,
Cauteries, Cupping-glasses, Frictions, Unctions, Embrocations, and
Suffumigations; had been all used though not with that desired success.

3. When I first came to him, I exhibited, for the strengthening of the Brain
and Nerves, a Medicament with Conserve of Roses, then he took a Cephalic
Decoction for thirty days, and the Oil or Balsam of Vitriol, was added at
certain seasons.

4. By these few and pleasant Medicines he Recovered his former Health, in a
fortnights time, which he kept without any Alteration to this very Juncture of
time, excepting the two last months, wherein he had the like affect, unless he
had been helped by our Industry.

5. Of all the coroberating Medicines our Diaphoreticum Aurum is one of the
best, and our stomacal Powder is also an universal Corroborative. Poterius, 2.
Observe. 34.

CII. A Salt Catarrh.

1. A worthy Gentleman of 45 years of Age, being afflicted with a salt Catarrh,
led his Life very unpleasantly and unhappily for the space of two years, under
a pretended Cure of 3 Physicians: For he was sometimes accustomed by their
direction to common Purgations, and Phlebotomies, sometimes to use Lignum
Guajac. now and then the Broths of Vipers, Juleps and Syrups; besides Capital
Conserves, Confections, Morsels, Pouders, Clysters, and many things else, so
that his Disease was most deplorable; an Alopecia being produced from a salt
Catarrh, with the asperity and siccity of the Skin of the Head, and accompanied
with St. Anthonies fire for some short Intervals.

2. While I thought of a fit Remedy to remove and extirpate this Catarrh, the
weakness and imbecility of the Ventricle proceeding from so many Medicaments
came under my serious Consideration, and was to me, very discernable; therefore
I had a prospect of comforting and succoring the Ventricle, as a very necessary
and public Instrument, which Our Stomatick specific did happily effect.

3. I call it Ours, because I know of none that has ever made mention of its
use and virtue: this Medicament is of a most sweet and pleasant Savor, and
does excert its efficacy without any manifest alteration, it is to be exhibited
in a very small quantity.

4. Now to Extract and draw forth this saltness out of the Body, we ordered the
taking of the Decoctum Melanagogum with the Lignum Sassafras for twenty days.

5. As for a Diet we prescribed such as is plentiful, without any mutation
almost of what was Customary; only the Patient was to abstain from all things
sharp, salt and spiced, with things wherein Vinegar was, as also Cheese and
other things of a bad nutriment.

6. With these few good and safe things, within the space of 25 days he was
freed from this stubborn, and as other Physicians called it, incurable Disease:
about seven years after his Cure he died, being under the Cure of other
Physicians of a simple Tertian. Poterius, Cent. 2. Observe. 52.

CIII. A Catarrh accompanied with a slow Fever, and a weakness of the
strength, and for some years contracted.

1. A certain Gentleman of thirty years of Age, was afflicted with many
grievous distempers; but the most troublesome and grievous of all these, was a
languishing Faintness and Pain of the Stomach, which I did ascribe principally
to Diet, and the weak Constitution of the Viscera, both as the external and
internal Causes of so many Evils.

2. And as a proof of the Cure I endeavored to strengthen the Viscera,
afterward to destroy and purge out those Fleeting and Congested humors both
in the Stomach, Intestines and other parts of the Body.

3. The first Indications we did absolve in a short time with our Stomachal
Specific, and the second with the following Decoction.

4. Take of choice China, cut in small pieces, half an ounce: sarsa parilla,
one ounce; sassafras two drams: Sanders, half a dram: Epithymum, Dodder and
sena, five drams: Annise, Coriander prepared, of each one pugil. the flowers of
Borage, Bugloss, Balm, Betony, of each one handful: the flowers of Violets,
one pugil: Boil them all in the Broth of a Capon. Poterius, Cent. 2. Observe. 71.

CIV. Of A Catarrh in general.

1. We may say concerning a Catarrh, as Ovid said of old concerning Erynis,
there is no Country wherein it does not Reign, it spares neither Man, Woman,
nor Child; against old Men it mainly bends its force.

2. A Catarrh is a distillation or defluxion of a preternatural superfluous
Humor from the Brain to the Members: Scholars talk much of the Name and Power
of a Catarrh, but we still consulting the profit of humane Kind; say with
Fernelius, that a Catarrh is a distillation of the excrementious Humor from
the Brain to the lower Parts.

3. I call it excrementious, because every thing which we Eat, has in it self a
Mucilaginous Tartar, very noxious and hurtful to the Health of Mankind, which
tartarous Impurity or filth seeing it cannot be wasted, subdued and separated,
there remains an Excrement, which should have a passage by Urine and other
secesses of Nature.

4. But if it comes to the Members and Lodges there, it is the foundation and
Basis of all distillations; from whence a Catarrh has its pecular differences
not from cold and heat, etc. as the vulgar Dreams, but from the nature of the
excrement, and the difference of the place.

5. The differences of Catarrhs are not learned in a long time, and by much use
and Experience; wherefore the Brain of all the Members does abound most with a
Catarrh, For it being a soft and moist Body, requires and needs equally a great
and suitable Nutriment, not so much for nourishing of the Bulk of the Body, as
for the Reparation and Regeneration of the Spirits.

6. Now to cut off this Catarrh, let us strengthen all the natural parts,
removing these Evils that are in them; we shall endeavor to dry the Brain,
because if it be nourished with good nutriment, there is but little Excrement
generated.

7. Therefore a frequent spitting is put under the name of a Catarrh, which
rather proceeds from the Stomach and Lungs than from the Brain; and because it
is not our purpose here to treat of the Essences of Diseases therefore in the
following we have purposed to speak of them singly. Poterius, Cent. 3. Observe.
92.

CV. An Inveterate Catarrh.

1. A certain Worthy Gentlewoman of 35 years of Age, having consulted with some
Physicians in Vain, within a short time being under my Cure, she grew perfectly
well.

2. For the removing of this ill disposition, the Cause whereof had a tendency
to a Dropsy, we gave Conserve of Roses with the Stomachal specific, and to
take away Obstructions, Sulphur Metallorum was used.

3. The strength being renewed and the distillation destroyed, the person was
restored to his former Health; the true method of Cure is as we have said;
therefore I would have you take notice, how wide they are from the truth that
Inculcate, as if the Brain were to be dried, the Liver to be cooled, and the
Ventricle to be warmed. Poterius, Cent. 3. Observe. 93.

CVI. A Catarrh in a Woman with Child.

1. My most dear and pious Wife, often, but chiefly when she was with Child,
was troubled with a Catarrh, and a pain in diverse parts of the Body: I do not
believe she used a purge three times for twenty years, (such was her healthful
disposition.)

2. But by my advise, she drew into her Nostrils, the Suffumigation of the best
Mastich, and that six times a day, by which she always had so suddenly help,
that afterward being as it were a Vice-Physician to her self (for so she would
merrily tell me) she Prescribed t^^ same thing oftentimes to her self, I not
knowing it.

3. I have Cured so many Catarrhs caused by a thick Lympha, with a
Suffumigation only, Or the Vapor of Vinegar poured upon a hot Iron, that it is
needless to name any.

4. In Choleric Catarrhs, I have also observed many, for Example sake the
honest Matron Lydia de Rovers, which always did very well (being first purged)
with the following mixture, which she took by spoonfuls.

5. Take Our Prophylactick Water, or (in defect of that) Vinegar rectified, an
ounce and half: Mint and Bawm-water, of each two ounces: syrup of Corn-poppy,
an ounce: Crabs eyes, levigated, half a dram: Laudanum O piatum, one grain: mix
them. Barbet, Prax. lib. 1. cap. 4. Observe. 1, 2, 3.

CVII. A Catarrh causing a Cough.

1. A certain Man, a Dyer, labored under a sharp Catarrh, which caused a most
extreme and strong Cough, chiefly in the Night; so that sometimes he cast up
Blood with his Coughing.

2. His Urine was very thin, and but little colored: I exhibited the following
Bolus: Take Cassia newly extracted, ten drams: Diagredium, three grains:
distilled Oil of Anniseeds, three drops: mix them well: he took it an hour
before supper: in the night he took Confectio Diatragacanthon frigidum.

3. In the Morning fasting, and at Night going to bed, he took the following
Tragea, or Powder: Take species diaireos simplex, two drams: brown sugar Candy,
fine white sugar, of each six drams: mix them: by the use of these things he
was quickly well. Gabelchoverus, Cent 4. Observe. 13.

CVIII. A Catarrh falling upon the Breast with difficulty of Breathing.

1. A Senator was taken with a grevious Catarrh, mighty difficulty of
breathing, with a pressure or heaviness or straitness about the Ventricle, with
a Urine thin and Choleric.

2. I Exhibited to him the following syrup at twice: Take syrup of Camomil
flowers, two ounces: syrup of the Juice of Scabious, one ounce: water of Ladys
thistle, of Coltsfoot, and of Veronica, of each two drams: mix them: He eat
also Succory roots Candied: his wife came to me 3 days after, and told me her
husband had much profited by the prescription.

3. I then prescribed to him Saculum Stomachalem, or a Stomacher quilted with
Spices: and the Breast and Stomach was anointed with the following Liniment:
Take Vnguentum pectorale, one ounce: Oil of Camomil, two drams: mix them: he
related that by twice applying of these things, the matter and straightness of
his Breast was gone to his great Satisfaction.

4. But by reason of his Suppers at Night, and large drinking, he complained a
fresh of his Catarrh falling upon his Breast, Arms, and other parts of his Body,
for which I prescribed the following Decoction.

5. Take Raspings of Guajacum, three ounces: Raisons, three ounces: roots of
Polypody, Liquorice rasped, of each five ounces: Galangal, seeds of Annise and
Fennel, of each one dram: Cinnamon, two scruples: spring water, twelve pints:
boil and make a Decoction according to Art.

6. His Feet also were washed with this following: Take leaves of Willow,
Mallows, Thyme, Camomil-flowers, of each one handful: Poppy-heads, number six;
boil in a sufficient quantity of Water, to wash the Feet with.

7. Lastly, he often took Confectio Diatragacanth frigid, by the use of which
things for a little while, he became perfectly well. Gabelcoverus, Cent. 4.
Observe. 65.

CIX. A Catarrh with a pain of the Head.

1. A certain Gentelman about thirty years of Age, his native Constitution hot
and dry, chiefly in respect of his Stomach, was obnoxious to a Catarrh, having
also great pains about his Temples, accompanied with a weakness of the Head.

2. The Operations of the Animal internal Faculties were thereby Impeded, his
Appetite was much abated, and a vehement Thirst presently seized him about the
time of Dinner and Supper.

3. Now that the Catarrh is the Cause of all the principal Diseases, Physicians
not without Cause do agree: there are seven Channels, according to Hippocrates,
to which the matter flows from the Head, to wit, the Ears, Eyes, Nostrils,
Palate, Ventricle, and Arteries, the Vertebrae of the Backbone, and the Nerves.

4. As to the present Observation, we must Inquire into the Antecedent Cause of
these distillations, where the Head offers it self in the first place, being
the Receptable and Cistern of the serous superfluity, For as much as every man's
Mouth and Tongue is naturally wet, from whence also the Membranes of the Brain
are found, when anatomized to be sprinkled over with a certain aqueous kind of
humor.

5. But where the Intemperature of the Parts happens by a multitude of Fumes
and Vapors, the matter of the defluxion is thereby increased and accumulated,
chiefly when that the hot and dry Constitution of the Vessels of the second
Concoction, by taking in too soon the humidity of the Aliments and by
disturbing the Chylous Juice of the Stomach, may administer occasion of feeding
and nourishing the Malady.

6. From whence, It is very Evident, why they that are afflicted with frequent
distillations or Catarrhs, are also subject to a cold Stomach.

7. For the immoderate heat of the Liver and Spleen hurts the Stomach two ways,
to wit, either by dissipating and debilitating, with their immoderation, the
native heat of the Stomach, or by extenuating the Region of the Stomach and
Belly; in so much that they wast and pine away.

8. Moreover the Vessels of Sanguification often generates Catarrhs; For the
serous humidity yet crude, is too hastily and soon Attracted by the Stomach,
which afterward (because the fault of the first Concoction is not amended in
the sccond) by the vehement attraction of the vessels being naturally hot and
dry, comes and remains in the mass of the venal and arterial Blood, and from
the ebullition and boiling of the Blood, is carried thence to and gathered in
the head as their proper Receptacle.

9. It is no wonder then that the head abounds with humid and moist Vapors,
when besides these there are many external Causes, which concur to produce
this effect, such as the Retention of usual Evacuations, the South Winds, etc.

10. This is plain in the present Case, because the hot and dry constitution of
the Vessels of sanguification are discerned by these signs, Galen proposes, to
wit, the Coldness and weakness of the Stomach in digesting, which proceeds
either from its inequal temperature, or from some hurt received from an
external object, and defluxions from the Head, often falling down thither.

11. As to this Gentleman's Head, which did abound from his younger years with
an Excrementitious humidity, the reason must be, That it being hoter than what
it should be, did attract too readily the serous matter, and for the
abovementioned Causes did cherish and nourish the same.

12. Next, as to the great pains he endured about the Temples, the reason
thereof is, the matter still increasing and growing outrageous did endeavor an
Egress and so did vellicate the sensible parts; the too great humidity of the
Brain did dull and blunt the Internal senses, and did also Cause a kind of
dullness and torpor of the Animal Spirits, which might occasion that weakness
of the Brain, whereof he complained.

13. The reasons why his Appetite was very much abated, was the falling down of
the serous matter upon the Ventricle which hindered the Concoction, another
reason was the humectation of the Stomachical Nerves, slowly exciting a
sensible Appetite.

14. Now follows the Indications: first, that the too hot and dry intemperature
of the Vessels of Sanguification be corrected: secondly, That the matter
copiously running to the Head be driven back: Thirdly, That the matter of the
Catarrh gathered in the Head be resolved, derived and evacuated.

15. Now, as to the first of these we prescribed him a Purgation to be taken
every half year for the Evacuation of the serous humidity, then a Lentive
Hydragogue to be taken in the spring, of the first tops or buds of Elder dried,
with a slow heat, the quantity of one dram in the Decoction of Prunes.

16. In the fall it will be convenient to Use the syrup of Buck-thorn, a
description whereof you may know by Soliander. [and in Our Dispensatory.]

17. This or the like being done, I advised, the oppening of a Vein, by which
not only the serous and wheyish Blood may be deminished, but all the Venial
kind may be helped ^y an amicable refrigeration.

18. After which, this following long digestive will not be inconvenient, which
is to be thus prepared: Take Roots of Succory, one ounce and half: Parsley,
Liquorice, of each half an ounce: leaves of Fumetory, Centory the lesser, of
each one handful and half: the flowers of Elder, half an handful: the seeds of
Fennel, one dram and half: boil them in the whey of Goats milk: thrice
distilled, strain to a pound and half: and take of the decoction twice every
day for the space of a fortnight, four ounces.

19. These being continued let him afterward take morsels of Mechoacanna, five
drams: with a fasting Stomach to purge withal, drinking the decoction of pease
for cleansing.

20. Neither are sweats to be neglected on the following days, but first, you
must take either the Electuary or Rob of dwarf Elder, half an ounce: dissolved
in the water of the flowers of Elder or the spirit of dwarf Elder, half an
ounce: mixed with the water of Fumitory, two ounces: or other Hydrotick
Medicines, as burnt Hartshorn, Terra sigillata, Lapis Bezoar, etc.

21. Lastly, for Corroberating and for prevention of too great heat, use often
the following powder, about two hours before Meat: Take Conserve of Roses
Vitriolated, one ounce and half: species Diarrhodon Abbatis, one dram: the
syrup of Conserve of Citron-peels, a sufficient quantity; make an Electuary.

22. For the second, to wit, That the matter flowing to the Head be drawn back,
which I judge may be done by taking those things Inwardly which restrain and
repress the crude Exhalations ascending from the Vessels of Concoction, of such
use are the Morsels mentioned above, whereof every Evening before sleep two
drams may be taken; Diacydonium simplex, half an ounce, after meat, and also
the fourth part of a Confected Nutmeg, being good for to Cause rest.

23. Outwardly Baths of proper herbs were prescribed, such as the decoctions of
the flowers of Sage, Bay Tree, Garden Thyme, the flowers of Camomil, Betony,
and red Roses.

24. Frictions and Ligatures are to be used in the time of bathings: and
evacuations of the Menstrua, may be made, by opening the Veins in the Legs: Or,
a Cautery may be made in the left Thigh.

25. As to the third, viz. the attenuation, derivation and evacuation of the
matter flowing together, inwardly we may try to Effect this by Masticatories,
therefore some grains of Mastick may be chewed frequently in the morning.

26. Or according to Fernelius: Take sugar Candy, one ounce and half: Mastich
half an ounce: Long-peper, Pyrethrum, staves-acre, of each one dram: make Pills
to be put into Noduls, and then to be broken between the Teeth.

27. Also sternutatories may be used, beginning first at those more light, to
wit, the Water of Marjoram, drawing it up often when it is a little warm, Or,
Take the Roots of Beets, one ounce: whole Barley, Liquorice, Currants, of each
half an ounce: Water ten ounces: Honey, two ounces: make a Decoction to a third
part, in the strained liquor, macerate the roots of Pyrethum, one dram: the
tops of Marjoram; the seeds of Nigella, of each one pugil, after twenty four
hours, let the liquor be expressed, which is to be snuft up the Nostrils pretty
warm.

28. Outwardly, let the Air be dry, and without being too warm, which if
otherwise by loosening the Humors would fill the Head; and for convenient
suffumigation, you may use some of the Powder of styrax Calamita, a little of
white Amber being added.

29. Or troches may be made for a fumigation, viz. Take styrax Calamita,
Benzoin, of each one dram and half: Tacamachacca, two drams: Cloves, Cinnamon
of each one dram: Conserve of Roses, a sufficient quantity for incorporating,
some drops of the water of Cinnamon being added, make Troches for a fume, for
the Richer sort, Musk, five grains, may be mixed therewith.

30. Little bags for the Head are not to be omitted, which are to be made of
these things which have in them an exsiccating virtue, without any great heat,
such are leaves of Betony, Marjoram, Rosemary flowers, Nutmegs, Sanders,
Mastich, Amber, red Roses, the seeds of Nigella, and the like.

31. Chiefly there is to be applied to the Neck a blystering Plaster, and for
some days let there be also applied a Colewort leaf, which is to be renewed
Morning and Evening, the Blysters being kept always open.

32. Fourthly and lastly, we think, That the Head and Stomach is to be
strengthened: by how much the Stomach is flower in Digestion, by so much the
more strengthening and corroberating the Diet should be.

33. And seeing Crudities are generated by Fishes, Milk, things made of it,
fried Meats and such like things of a hard Concoction; therefore great heed
must be taken to forbear these; as also from all Varieties and Repletions in
reference both to things that are to be Eaten and drunk.

34. Let your drink be Wine wherein is Sage or Rosmarie, or some other thing
which can strengthen the Head and Stomach.

35. Use frequently with a fasting Stomach the following Electuary: Take
Conserve of Betony, Rosemary, of each one ounce: Borrage, six drams: species
diamoschi dulcis, Diambrae of each half a dram: Nutmeg and Ginger Confected, of
each two drams: with the syrup of Betony or staechas, a sufficient quantity,
make an Electuary, to which add the spirit or Oil of Vitriol seven drops.

36. In this place the Confection also of Diamoschi dulcis, Aromaticum,
Diarrhodon Abbatis, with the species of Annise, and the like, will be very
convenient.

37. Outwardly, let him wear a Cucupha, made of the flowers of Camomil,
Rosemary, Staechas, of each half an handful: red Roses, Balaustians, of each
one dram and half: the seeds of Nigella, Coriander prepared, of each one dram:
Mace, Nutmeg, of each two scruples: make a gross Powder to be put into Cotton
or silk for a Cucupha. Ex Gregorij Horstij, Tom. 2. lib. 2. Observe. 11.

CX. A Catarrh from Intemperature of the Stomach.

1. The famous Nicolaus Braun, professor of Philosophy and Physic, to the
Learned and worthy Gregorius Horstius, Physician.

2. A certain noble Lady being long afflicted with a tedious, uneasy and daily
Catarrh, does Crave your Advice; if perhaps by our Joint Endeavors we may by
the blessing of God contribute either to the removing, or at least the
mitigation of her Distemper.

3. The cause of this Catarrh, proceeded from the intemperature of the Stomach,
and the heat of the Liver, by which means she was troubled with a vehement
Thirst, which caused her to drink plentifully, from whence a great many Vapors
being breed the matter of the distillation was continued and increased, which
being afterward coagulated, did fall down on the Breast, and caused a great
difficulty of breathing, together with a violent Cough.

4. But some times the Stomach was freed by an unforced and spontaneous
vomiting, from the great plenty of the phlegmatic and serous matter, and
sometimes the Head by the Expurgation of the like superfluous matter through
the Nostrills, and nature assisting her to Expectorate the matter gathered in
the Breast, she got no small ease.

5. Now nature being so kind and favorable, there was but few Medicaments
used, we prescribed only some for cleansing of the peccant matter, viz. Pil.
Cochiae and Pil. Agarick; and for drying of the Stomach, and comforting it, we
ordered Conserve of Roses, and a Compound stomatick powder.

6. Outwardly, we prescribed Cucupha's, and a Powder for a perfume to
strengthen the Brain, and to dry up its Excrements, as also anointing of the
Stomach and Epithems, etc.

7. Pectorals, I did not think very necessary, because of the former easy
Expectoration, but rather that the Stomach and Liver should be regarded, as the
Original of Catarrhs.

8. Her body being Plethorick, I esteemed it necessary to open a V^in,
notwithstanding this n^ble person for want of Expectoration in the precedent
night was almost suffocated, then I prescribed her to take of the Infusion of
Agarick and Turbeth, having before taken a digestive Pectoral.

9. And for diminishing the vapors from the Stomach and Liver, I looked on the
powder of Species diarrhodon Abbatis, with Cinnamon and Mastich to be very good.

10. I also prescribed for the discussion of Wind, with which the Stomach and
Lungs were swelled, to wit, a gross powder of the seeds of Annise, of Fennel,
and Cinnamon, with the Confection of Fennel, and Ginger.

11. After these flatulencies were discussed, I ordered other necessary things
for the strengthening of the Stomach and Head, for drying up the peccant
humors in the Breast, and for expectorating the Recrements, etc.

12. The Answer of Gregorius Horstius to the most Excellent and famous
Nicholaus Braun.

13. Although all things by you were dexterously and rightly administered
according to the Physical Indications to that Noble Lady, and that no better
Medium can be prescribed, than what you have ordered; yet to satisfy her
expectation, and gratify her Importunity I shall very willingly offer what is
further to be done.

14. In the first place the Intemperature of the Vessels of Concoction is to
be corrected by those things, which not only alter the hot Intemperature, but
does also evacuate the superfluities about the first and second Region; besides
those above mentioned by you, the powder of Agarick mixed with the Extract
Diacnicu, is good for Evacuation.

15. And it will not be Inconvenient for alteration to take the Conserve of the
roots of Succory, with Conserve of Roses vitriolated.

16. Secondly, the Fumes ascending to the Head are to be checked, that it may
be done; Take pills de Succino and Morsels against distillations made of old
Conserve of Roses, Mastich, Frankincense, Nutmegs, etc. she may take them every
other day in the Evening, before she goes to Sleep.

17. Thirdly, the matter gathered in the Head is to be derived from thence, for
which end apply to the nape of the Neck, a Plaster of Cantharides.

18. Fourthly, the Catarrh is to be stopped, and suspended, I would have omitted
the sprinkling of powder about the Neck, as also bags of Nigella, Mastich, and
Nutmeg, etc.

19. Lastly, For expectorating, cutting and digesting the matter, I approve of
Oxymell of Tobacco, from Quercetan, and Rouls of the juice of Liquorice with
the Species Diatragacanthum frigidum, Oil of Fennel, and sugar dissolved in the
water of Paul's Betony, by these Medicines, a good Diet being observed, I hope
that she will find Ease, and be freed from her Catarrh and Cough: farewell. Ex
Gregorij Horstij, Tom. 2. lib. 2. Observe. 12.

CXI. A copious and thin Catarrh from an evil disposition of the Brain.

1. Philip Perse, Physician in Ordinary to the Princes of Austria: To his
Friend Gregorius Horstius, Doctor and Professor of Physic in the University of
Giessena.

2. This Gentleman had a great hoarsness, which without doubt was much
nourished and increased by the Catarrh; the reason I conceive of this hoarsness
is, the Evil digestion of the Brain; or rather a cold and moist Humor,
because he never complained of any Heat, Tumor, Redness, Thirst, etc.

3. Now, that this and its Conjunct Cause may be taken away, and that for the
future no new matter may be generated, but that the parts may be strengthened,
I propose the taking of the Decoction of China and Sarsa parilla.

4. This will not dry the parts too much, if you put in the Decoction a small
Portion of Calves flesh, in imitation of Fernelius; who made Use of the same in
Phthisical persons, whom he restored by a Decoction of the Wood of the
Laser-tree, and grew exceeding fat by using the same.

5. Zuvingerus commends the bark of Guajacum, who ascribes a greater virtue of
purging and opening to it, than the wood it self, because of a greater saltness
in the one than the other; to one ounce of which he did pour six pound of
Water, and then boiled it to a Consumption of the half: he would have also
added to the Decoction six drops of the Oil of Sulphur, according to Crato.

6. Now for the strengthening of the Head, and for removing and cutting off the
Catarrh, two things are approved of, which by certain experience, I have found
good, the first is the use of the pills Asajareth and Arabicae of each either
one scruple, or half a dram: give it every Evening about the time of going to
Bed.

7. The other is of Ludovicus Mercatus, who disallows Galens Plaster of
Pigeons-dung, and in the place of that approves of the powder of Roses, yellow
Sanders, Coral prepared, Celtick spike and gum Juniper: and every fourth day to
sprinkle it upon the Head, but it must be first shaven.

8. His night Cap may be perfumed with the following powder: Take gum Juniper,
Frankincense, of each two drams: the wood of Aloes, one dram and half: Sage,
six drams: make a Powder.

9. And in the day time he may wear a quilt on his Head, after the manner of a
Cucupha, of gum Juniper, Frankincense, Roses, Cammomil, Staechas, Marjoram,
Nutmegs, grains of Juniper, long Pepper, Cloves and the Wood of Aloes.

10. For the strengthening of the Stomach and for stopping the Ascension of
vapors to the Head, I have in great esteem the Tragaea of Crato made of
Biscuit, as also of Coriander, Cinnamon, Mastich, Roses, the shavings, of
Ivory, the flesh of Quinces, Coral prepared and the gizzard of an Hen,
experience has abundantly showed the good of these things, among Medicines to
be outwardly applied.

11. I have found great success by Electuarium phonascorum, which Forestus made
use of for taking away of Hoarsness, which is as follows: Take Lozenges of
Diatragacanthon frigidum, sugar Penids, white sugar Candy, of each half an
ounce: fresh Pine-nuts, macerated in Coltsfoot water, two drams: sweet Almonds
blanched, numb. 9. and beaten with pure Juice of Liquorice Extracted to the
thickness of new Honey, a dram and half: syrup of Violets, two ounces and half:
Loch Sanum, half an ounce: mix and make a Lohoch or soft Electuary.

12. Or you may take Sugar Candy mixed with the Oil of sweet Almonds, for a
Lambitive, or Lohoch of pine-nuts; or Sanum, or Troches, of Diatragacanthum
frigidum.

13. Forestus mentions another Composition, which I have Used successfully:
Take Juice of Liquorice, white sugar of each two drams: the seeds of Purslane,
of Cucumbers, of Melons, of Citrulls cleansed, of each half a dram: white
Starch, Tragacanthum, of each one dram: sugar Penids, two drams and half: make
Pills to be dissolved under the Tongue.

14. Cupping-glasses applied to the Shoulders with Scarrification have been
very profitable, these things I gave the sick: Ex Gregorij Horstij, lib. 2.
Tom. 2. Observe. 12.

CXII. A Catarrh falling down upon the Breast and external parts.

1. Johannes Bilgerius, Physician in Ordinary to the Republic of Campodonia,
to Gregorius Horstius, Physician to the Republic of Vlme.

2. The occasion of Writing to you now, is concerning a Gentlewoman who is
afflicted with perpetual Distillations, of whose temperature and manner of
Life, I shall give you some Relation.

3. This Woman aged thirty six years, is for the most part of a pale color,
very lean, and is troubled with an Indisposition both of the principal and less
principal Bowels; by her Urine, I Judge her inclinable to a Cold temperament,
and her kind of Life to be Sedentary, and her Diet diverse or rather Improper,
which is too common amongst many Women.

4. This person for about three years had continued Distillations, sometimes
salt, sometimes sweet, which fell down on the Breast and External Members;
insomuch that by some she was thought Paralytick.

5. With this violent Catarrh, she had also a vehement Cough, especially at
Night and Morning, the Phlegm she than spit up was tough and of a yellowish
color, she was also afflicted sometimes with shortness of Breath, and
difficulty of Respiration; about Noon the matter which she spit fourth was of a
white color.

6. The various Remedies, used by other Physicians and my self, I have compared
with your Recipe's; the first thing you propose is pil. de Succina Cratonis,
with the species Dianthos; these my Friend and I have used without the species
Dianthos adding to one scruple Pil. Aloes Rosatum, one scruple or one scruple
and half: a description whereof follows: Take Aloes Rosatum, one ounce and
half: Mastich, Xylo-aloes, Liquorice scraped, red Roses, of each one dram:
Cinnamon, two drams: Rhubarb, one dram and half: Spicknard, half a dram: with
the juice of Roses, make a mass, and take one Dose at seven in the Morning,
another at three in the Afternoon, and the third at seven a Clock the next day.

7. Secondly, you propose Morsels; but in the place of these I use Rouls,
Compounded after the following manner: Take species Aromaticum Rosatum, species
Diarrhodon, of each two drams: Cinnamon, eight scruples: Nutmegs, two scruples:
Sugar dissolved in Betony-water, and black Cherry water, of each a sufficient
quantity, add of the Oil of Amber, eight drops.

8. Thirdly, you propose pectoral Rowls, in the place of which, I use species
Diaireos simplex, compounded with the flowers of sulphur, also the species
Diatragacanthum with the Water and Oil of Fennel, likewise trochisci Bechisci.

9. Fourthly, You propose a Lambitive, in the place of this, I prescribe many
things according to the exigence of the Catarrh, such as Oxymel of squills: I
also make a syrup of ground Ivy, Coltsfoot, Jujubes, Scabious, Paul's Betony,
which I use with or without the flowers of Sulphur, and the Oil of the same;
also an Electuary of Marshmallows, with the root of Elecampane, Quinces, with
boiled Honey, the flowers of Sulphur, being added, I have found this very
profitable and successful in this and other Distempers.

10. Fifthly you propose a suffumigation not very different from our
description, to wit: Take Mastich, two ounces: Gum Juniper, Styrax, yellow
Amber, Benjamin, Frankincense, of each one ounce: make a gross powder.

11. Sixthly, you propose a powder to be sprinkled on the Coronal Suture, the
following description I used in the same Words, without any alteration: Take
Mastich, Frankincense, Amber, Cloves, Gum Juniper, the Wood of Aloes and red
Roses: make all into a powder.

12. Seventhly, you propose an Electuary of Tamarinds with the leaves of Sena,
If the Belly be at any time bound, I take Prunes with some of the leaves of
Sena.

13. Eighthly, you propose the taking of Troches to be held under the Tongue
till they are dissolved, in the place of these, chiefly when the distillation
is thin, I have very fortunatly used the Pil. de styra ce Cratonis, I have used
also other things such as the flowers of Sulphur, the water and roots of
Coltsfoot, Amber and sugar Candy to be taken in Goats-milk, or in a rear Egg.

14. Likewise pectoral decoctions have been tried, made of the roots of Althea,
Elecampane, Centory the greater, Liquorice, Cloves, Jujubes, Sebestans, Prunes,
Raisons, Coltsfoot, ground Ivy, Sena, together with pectoral Waters made of
Scabious, Paul's Betony, ground Ivy, Hyssop, Cinnamon and sugar Candy.

15. Lastly, I used the Pulvis Haly, and Anonymi: farewell. Ex Gregorij
Horstij, Tom. 2. lib. 2. Observe. 12.

CXIII. A Catarrh, upon the Jaws.

1. I ordered one to open a Vein every Spring, in order to prevent a
suffocation by a Catarrh upon the Jaws, and to be Cupped with Scarification on
his Shoulders, three or four times in a year.

2. And to Bath his Feet at Night with this decoction hot, made of Lie, with
Sage and Camomil, and to purge twice a year with Pilsine quibus, two scruples:
taken at midnight, and every month, if they Work without trouble.

3. In the fit he took Aqua vitae and sugar Candy, with Cinnamon and a little
Rose Water; a spoonful or two, and after that he held in his Mouth Housleek and
Althaea roots boiled in Goats Milk.

4. He wore about his Neck a black Woollen Cloth dipped in Oil of Lillies, and
covered with Linen.

5. If the Disease holds him still, he may apply the following plaster to his
Neck: Take Swallows-nest, six ounces: Powder and boil it in white Wine, add
powder of Bayberries, an ounce: Honey, two ounces: Oil of Lillies, three
ounces: make a plaster: apply it hot to the Neck: this did Effect the Cure.
Platerus lib. 1. pa. 185.

CXIV. A suffocating Catarrh.

1. A Laundress Washing night and day, and handling wet linen at midnight, had
a Fever, accompanied with a straitness of Breast, and difficulty of Breathing,
also with a Snorting and Wheezing in her Lungs, and especially when she lay
upon her right side, she felt pain chiefly in her Breast.

2. I showed that the defluxion did not fall only upon the Lungs, and that they
were Inflamed with a Peripneumony, but also it fell upon the Muscles of the
Breast.

3. She spit Crudities, and though Expectoraters were outwardly and inwardly
applied, Ointments and Cataplasms, yet the Dyspnaea increased, and she died
snorting the third day about midnight. Platerus, lib. 1. pa. 186.

CXV. A Catarrh and Cough after a Fever.

1. A certain Gentleman having a Catarrh and great Cough after a Fever, which
is usual, especially toward Winter in foul Bodies, in which it may not be
convenient by reason of the Fever to purge sufficiently and more especially
because he was still weak.

2. Afterward, at a fit time I purged him with Confection of Citrons purgative
and I sent Tablets of Diatragacanthum frigidum, to hold at night in his mouth
and others made with Oil of Anniseeds, and ordered a good Diet to restore him,
especially with Broth of Wine and Eggs.

3. I allowed him to drink Wine the twelfth day after, his Cough not abated, I
sent him Hydromel of wine to drink, to strengthen and purge, and ordered a
spoonful of Diacodium to be taken at Night, and if his Cough ceased not, and he
slept not, to let him take as much at Midnight.

4. This (as his Wife declared in praise of it) Did the first night; thus, he
was Cured of a dangerous disease, that continued thirty days. Platerus, lib. 2.
page 288.

CXVI. A Catarrh, Cough, and pain of the side, with the Fever Synoch.

1. An Old man full of business, continued too long in the cold, for he had a
shaking and a little Cough, yet went abroad the day following about Business
that tried him, and then fell a shaking again, after into a Fever, and
presently found a pricking in his right side, he felt it only when he Coughed,
but it was grievious.

2. First he spit frothy, and could not lie on his right side without great
pain, especially when he Coughed, but sat upright.

3. I was of the opinion, that a defluxion moved from the Synoch Fever, fell
from the Head upon the Intercostal Muscles; and that it was a Bastard Pleurisy;
and because the next day, he began to spit up yellow matter, but little, and
with difficulty.

4. I said that part of the humor fell upon the Lungs, and that there was a
crude Peripneumony.

5. The next day, when the Catarrh first began, and he had a Coriza, I ordered
him this night Cap: Take Orrice roots, half an ounce: Angelica, two drams:
Marjoram, red Roses, each a dram: Coriander seed, a dram: Gith seeds, half a
dram: Storax Calamita, Benjamin, each a dram: make a powder for a quilted Cap
to be used.

6. At night he washed his feet with the Decoction of Sage and Camomil in Lie,
and had a bag of Bran, Milium, and Camomil-flowers boiled in Wine, applied to
his side.

7. Coming the third day to visit, I found that his Pulse was feverish, his
Urine high, and he very weak, being also of a weak Constitution.

8. Because his Belly rumbled, I gave an ounce of Manna in Broth, it gave him a
large stool, he drank the Decoction of Raisons stoned with this syrup: Take
syrups of Jujubes, Violets, of each an ounce: Juleps of Violets, two ounces:
Oxymel simple, half an ounce: mix them.

9. Because he spit no Blood, and his Fever was not very great, I did not let
him Blood.

10. On the fourth day, his side was anointed with the following: Take Oil of
Camomil and sweet Almonds, of each half an ounce: Oil of Orrice, two drams,
resumptive Ointment, half an ounce: mix them.

11. And because he was exceeding weak, I gave him this Julep: Take Julep of
Violets, two ounces: Oxysaccharum simple, an ounce: Cinnamon water, half an
ounce: Manus Christi, two drams: and applied this Epithem to his Pulses: Take
Rose Water, three ounces: Bugloss, Scabious-water, each an ounce: Vinegar of
Roses, half an ounce: juice of Lemons, two drams and half: mix and make an
Epithem.

12. On the fifth day he Coughed seldomer, yet with difficulty and pain: Take
Dates, five: Jujubes, Sebestens, of each ten pair; Liquorice roots, an ounce
and half: Maiden hair, an handful, with sugar boil it thick: Let him take it
often: let him Eat also Barley boiled, with Vinegar and Damask prunes, and a
little thin Chicken Broth, he had Tablets of Diatragacanth and juice of Violets.

13. The sixth day, his Fever remitted, but his Urine was very high, and
because there was a pricking in his Breast and Shoulders, and his Belly
troubled, I gave him another ounce of Manna in Broth: and he had eight stools
after Dinner without pain, in so much that he was restored thereby.

14. He took boiled Rice in Broth, and he used his syrup, and the ointment for
his Breast: he slept well.

15. On the tenth, day he was without a Fever or pain; his Cough, only
remained, he continued his Syrup and Tablets.

16. On the eleventh, his Cough troubled him at Night, and he was Bound, I gave
him another ounce of Manna, with Broth: And this Linctus: Take powder of
Diatragacanth frigidum, a dram: sugar Candy, two drams: with syrup of
Liquorice, make a Lohoch: he gradually recovered of this Distemper: Platerus.
lib. 2. pa. 344.

CXVII. A Catarrh, a Disease of the Eyes going before.

1. This Gentlewoman complained of a Cloud before her Eyes, and she saw badly
with the left Eye only, also had the same Cheek numbed, which she said had been
long so: hence I judged, that the Nerves in that part of the Brain were
affected, she wept Tears, and had a Catarrh.

2. To drive the defluxion to the Nose, that ran through the great corner of
the Eye, I ordered that small Hellebore roots should be put into the Nose, and
they did good.

3. I purged her with syrup of Roses, of the Infusion of Sena, and Agarick, an
ounce: Catholicon, half an ounce: Diaphenicon, a dram.

4. I ordered for five Doses an Apozem, as in a phlegmatic Megrim, in my Golden
Practice: Take Fennel, etc. I took off the Escar, by force and put in a tent of
Gentian.

5. The Jaw swelled again, and I ordered the last Cataplasm for the Aposteme
under the Eye; the Apostem broak and to the other in the Corner, I applied a
Cataplasm, after an Emplaster that begins thus. Take Honey, etc.

6. She had only a Plaster upon the Ulcer without a Cataplasm, which first
voided much matter, and afterward became sound.

7. I ordered, that she should take my third Aromatic powder in the Chapter of
Palsies, in my Golden practice mentioned for three mornings.

8. All was well, but because the Eye was red, and some matter did flow with
Tears out of the great corner of the Eye, and her Eyelids were glewed together
after sleep, I ordered this: Take Pomegranate-peels, six drams, boil them in
Rose and Plantane-water, to four ounces: strain, add Blood Stone, two drams:
white Vitriol, a scruple: Camphir, half a scruple: when it is used, add the
Infusion of Fleabane seed, made in Rose Water: by this the Cure was perfected,
for the sight Returned and the pain and redness went away. Platerus, lib. 2.
page 384.

CXVIII. A salt and thin Catarrh.

1. A Young man having for three or four months been very much afflicted with a
Catarrh, so as that he could never cease spitting, he came to me and desired my
help:

2. I caused him first to be Purged three or four times with these pills: Take
Pil. Aloephanginae,, one dram and half: Pil. Cochiae, two drams and half: Oil
of Lavender, six drops: with a few drops of Liquid storax, make a mass of Pills
for four doses.

3. Afterward I ordered him to take of Laudanum Opiatum, three or four grains
every night going to bed, for fourteen nights, after which I prescribed him
Amber in fine powder, to be taken half a dram at a time mixed with Conserve of
Roses, and this to be done Morning and Evening for two or three Weeks.

4. Lastly, for his common constant drink he took a Decoction made of equal
parts of Guajacum, Sasafras, China, and Sarsa, boiled in water a sufficient
quantity, then strained, and bottled up with a little white Sugar and a Clove:
By the use of these things, in something more then a months time, he became
perfectly well. Ex M.S.S.R. Turneri. Observe. 37.

CXIX. A Catarrh almost desperate.

1. A certain Merchant was so much afflicted with the Catarrh, that his
Recovery was despaired of among Physicians: I Cured him by purging him thrice
with my Antimony, for three Mornings together.

2. And I gave him six Juleps prepared of the pectoral decoction, with the
Extract of Lemons and Oranges, and the Extract of Peony with the spirit of
Vitriol, and the fume of white Amber: these Medicines being all used, he was
perfectly Recovered. Petrus Faber Observe. 87.

CXX. The Catarrh accompanied with pains of the Gout.

1. I Allow of an Issue in the left Arm and right Leg, for diverting the Serous
humors, then the Belly to be made laxative by honey of Roses solutive and
manna dissolved in the common Lenitive decoctions, with the leaves of Sena.

2. Afterward the Humors are to be prepared and the Obstructions are to be
opened with Crystal of Tartar vitriolated, Magisteries of Coral and Pearls,
salt of Wormwood, with the Broth of a Pullet.

3. Then the vicious humors are to be cast forth by the Infusion of the leaves
of Sena, fresh Agarick trochiscated, and Rhubarb in Betony-water, to which add
some of the drops of the spirit of Vitriol rectifyed, in the straining dissolve
the Honey of Roses solutive and Manna.

4. But, if another form of Pills shall please more; I approve of Extractum
Pil. Cochiae, Aureae, sine quibus, and the Pil. Panchymagogae Crollij.

5. The body being thus cleansed, the Brain is to be purged by taking in the
powder of Tobacco, with the flowers of lilly Convally, and Marjoram prepared,
to which should be added a little Musk.

6. For strengthening the Brain, take the following things to wit, the
Confection of the species Diambrae, Diamoschi Dulcis, Diapliris-archonticon,
with Musk, white Amber, and the confection of Alkermes.

7. Here follows an excellent Cerecloth to be applied to the Coronal suture:
Take Labdanum, styrax Calamita, Mastich and Amber, with Resin dissolved in
spirit of Wine, make a Cerecloth to be spread upon Leather.

8. The Stomach is to be also helped; I allow of the Pulvis Pepticus, to be
taken after Meat: Take Coriander prepared, with the species Aromaticum Rosatum,
Magisteries of Coral and Pearl, with a sufficient quantity of sugar, make a
Tragea.

9. Then a Stomachical Cerecloth of Labdanum and Tacamahacha, and for subduing
all these Symptoms, make use of the Decoction of Guajacum prepared with China.

10. This is to be done, if we look to the first, second and third qualities,
because hot and dry things do amend and correct the colder temper of the Brain
and Ventricle: whereas sharp and bitter things do Cut, atenuate and open the
humors, and evacuates them with a Hydrotick and Diaphoretick violence by Sweats
and the habit of the Body.

11. The former comforts, the members, and restores strength: or in the place
thereof may be prepared a distillation of Lignum Sanctum, China, Sarsa-parilla,
Capital and antipodagrick herbs. Thonerus, lib. 5. Consult. 1.

CXXI. The Catarrh, with pain of the Loins, and an Atrophia of one of the Legs.

1. The Brain is to be dried and purged, as also the Stomach and Belly; then I
allow of oppening of the middle Vein; and I do not disapprove of an Issue in
the left Arm, and right Leg.

2. For the Evacuation of the whole Body: Take the Cephalic pills, the Extract
of pil. Cochiae, Aureae, sine quibus, Extractum Panchymagoge Crollij.

3. The medicated wine: Take of the leaves of Betony, Bawm, Rosemary-flowers,
Hyssop, Wormwood, Carduus Benedictus, of each one pugil. roots of Elecampane,
Fennel, of each two drams: the leaves of Sena, ten drams: fresh Agarick
trochiscated, three drams: choice Turbith, two drams: Jalap, two drams and
half: Jujubes, Dates, of each half an ounce: Cream of Tartar, one dram and
half: Galangal the lesser, one dram: Cinnamon, one dram and half: Wine three
pints: Bawm water, a pint: make a Bag.

4. The Body being well purged the Decoction of lignum Sanctum, and
Sarsa-parilla with a little of Lignum sassafras, will do well. Thonerus, lib.
5. Consult. 7.

CXXII. A Catarrh with other symptoms.

1. There was an insensibleness and weakness of Memory, as also a languishing
Appetite, with a stupor and cold in his Feet, which did accompany this Disease;
all which did proceed from a cold and moist temperature of the Brain.

2. As to the Method of Cure, the phlegmatic humors are to be Evacuated by
phlegmagogues, the Brain and Stomach with the Nervous kind, are to be heated
and dried; to accomplish which ends, the following Medicaments I count useful.

3. First Cephalic Pills are to be taken for drawing away the phlegm from the
Head: Take pil. Cochiae, aureae, sine quibus, of each one scruple: Extractum
Catholicum, six grains, with Betony-water make pills.

4. About the space of eight days after this medicated Wine is to be taken:
Take the roots of Elecampane, Orrice, Fennel, of each two drams: the leaves of
Betony, Hysop, Staechas, Sage, Rosemary-flowers, Bawm, Carduus Benedictus, of
each one pugil; the leaves of Sena, ten drams: fresh Agarick trochiscated,
three drams: white Gum of Turbith, two drams: Mechoacan, two drams and half:
Cream of tartar, one dram and half: Dates, Jujubes, of each half an ounce:
Galangal the lesser, one dram: make a Bag and infuse them into three pints of
Wine: Or rather in Hydromel to be taken every other Morning, about a quarter of
a pint before Dinner.

5. For strengthening the Brain take the bigness of a Nutmeg of the following
Confect: Take the Conserves of the flowers of Marjoram, Sage, of each six
drams: Staechas, Betony, Rosemary, flowers, of each half an ounce: Myrobolans,
Embelicks, Confected Chebs, of each two: confected Nutmegs, three drams: Citron
peels, two drams: species Diambrae, diamoschi dulcis, of each two scruples:
Diaplirisarconticon made with Musk, half a dram: Dianthos, one scruple with the
syrup of the Conserves of Nutmeg; make a soft Electuary.

6. Or if it will please better in a more soled form: Take species Diambrae,
diamoschi dulcis, Diapliris archonticon with Musk, of each two scruples:
Confectio Alkermes, half a dram: the distilled Oil of Nutmegs, six drops: Oil
of Amber Rectifyed four drops: fine sugar dissolved in Lavender-water, and
black Chery-water, four ounces: make a Confection in Rouls.

7. Every other Morning the hinder part of the Head and Neck was anointed with
the following Balsam: Take Balsam of Marjoram and Amber, of each one dram: Oil
of Nutmegs expressed, four scruples: the distilled Oil of Sage, and Cloves, of
each four drops: Musk, Ambergrise, of each 3 grains: mix them.

8. Afterward, you must wear a Cap of the following things: Take the flowers
of Marjoram, Sage, staechas, Rosemary-flowers, of each one pugil: Lignum Aloes,
one dram: Cloves, three scruples: white Amber, Gum Juniper, of each one
scruple: styrax Calamita, half a dram: Troches Gallia moschata, half a scruple:
make a round Cap of red silk.

9. For the stupor of the hinder part of the Head and Neck you may Anoint with
the Oil of Myrrh and the Oil of Gum Ammoniacum, made by dissolution in the
white of an Egg, and hard pressed out, or melted per deliquium into liquor.

10. For comforting the Stomach this Balsam will do good: Take Balsam of Fennel
two drams: the distilled Oil of Mace, three drops: mix: and give it in
Chickenbroth.

11. Outwardly let there be applied Gum Tacamachacca, choice Labdanum, of each
six drams: make a Sear-cloath.

12. If the disease be so stuborn as that it will not yield to these, then make
use of the decoction of lignum Sanctum with a little Sassafras. Thonerus, lib.
5. Cons. 12.

CXXIII. A Catarrh with a Cough.

1. In the beginning of this Disease I commended the milder sort of Clysters,
proceeding by little and little to the use of those that are stronger.

2. Let him use frictions of the Back, Shoulders, Arms and Legs, then let him
sprinkle upon the Head a Powder made of Cloves and Sandarack.

3. But if the distillation be more Urgent and vehement, I would exhibit in the
Evening one scruple: half a ^^^m or two scruples, more or less, of Philonium
with Conserve of Roses, or one Pill, or one and half: or two pills, cut into
little pieces, with Conserve of Roses, the description of which is as follows.

4. Take Masculine, Frankincense, juice of Liquorice, of each one dram: Opium,
Saffron, Myrrh, of each one scruple: mix them with the syrup of white Poppies:
and make little Pills, numb. 9. each pill, one dram: I have made use of these
with singular advantage in troublesome Distillations from the Head and a great
Cough, and I use them daily.

5. When the Catarrh seems to require it, the newest Treacle and Mithridate may
be Exhibited.

6. I have observed, that when the Catarrh has been so violent that the Sick
has been in danger of Suffocation, that Vinegar being Infused has stopped the
Impetuous violence of the defluxion, and has rendered to the Patient a more
liberal Respiration. Reinerus Solenander Cons. 4. Sect. 3.

CXXIV. A Catarrh upon the Lungs with a continual Cough.

1. Take Cambogia, eight grains: Tartar vitriolated, four grains: the Oil of
Amber, three drops with syrup of Roses, solutive: make five pills: Guild them,
they Evacuate profitably serous and Catarrhus humors.

2. In the next place for attenuating the matter afflicting the Lungs, and for

1. cap. 1. lib. 3.

CXXV. A Catarrh falling upon the Stomach.

1. The Catarrh is a moist vapor which assaulteth the Head, and afterward
falls down again into the Stomach, where it Ingrosseth and Corrupts, this
moisture has its beginning of the moisture of the Lungs, and until such time
as the Lungs be discharged thereof, the Catarrh will continue in its force.

2. This Disease reigns move in Phlegmatic and Melancholy Bodies, than in any
of other Constitutions; such as are troubled with it, are not long lived,
because their Lungs consume by little and little, and thereupon they are
troubled with the Ptisick, and consequently they perish, if they be not quickly
Relieved.

3. Take Pulmonaria and Sena, that is fresh and new: Infuse them in wine and
water over a small or gentle Fire, till the wine have drawn out the Virtue;
then strain it, and put thereunto our Quintessence, and keep it close in a
glass: Let the Patient drink thereof every Morning three ounces luke warm, for
twenty days together, let him Eat good nourishing Meats.

4. If the Patient be weak you shall give him new-laid Eggs, and good White
wine: If the humidity be perceived not to be quite expelled and evacuated, then
give him our Aromatico, afterward comfort him again with Restauratives and
Cordials, to make him strong.

5. This method of curing this Disease differs from the common course
Physicians take, who would Cure it by Diet, Bleeding, Mollifying Liniments, and
by causing them to spit, and such like; which are means rather to augment then
diminish the Catarrh. Phioravant.

LONDON, Printed for Th. Dawks, and L. Curtiss.

The Chapter of the Catarrh continued. Numb. 56.

CXXVI. Another Cure of the said Disease.

1. If you would cure this Disease, use these five things. 1. Our Electuario
Angelico. 2. Our Quintessence solutive. 3. Our pilulae pro descenso. 4.
Ointments for the Stomach, and Head. 5. Our Quintessence Vegetable.

2. The Electuary cleanses the Head and Stomach: the Quintessence solutive
evacuateth the Body: the Pills take away the cause of the descension; the
Ointments dry; and the Vegetable Quintessence preserves the Body, from all ill
and noysom maladies.

3. The Electuary must be taken first in the morning: the Quintessence
solutive, you must take a spoonful of in the Morning in a little Broth and
sugar, keeping a good Diet, this is to be done for four or six days; then take
the Pills in the Evening, and in the mean time anoint the Head and Stomach with
the Oil of Wax, and drink every Morning a little of our Quintessence, which if
you do use continually, there is no doubt but the Body shall be freed from many
troublesome maladies.

4. There was a certain Woman of the age of fifty eight years, who being
grievously afflicted with a Catarrh, was cured by the use of our Aqua
preservans, taking it Morning and Evening, and by anointing the Stomach with
our Balsam.

5. One that was troubled with a Catarrh and a Stitch in his side, was thus
cured, He took Our Aromatico twice, then he took every Morning of our
Quintessence solutive, with the Broth of a Capon, for seven or eight days
together; and every night when he went to bed, he anointed his Stomach with
Oleum Incombustibile and thereby was soon Cured.

6. Another woman having a Catarrh with a pain of the Head and Stomach,
stoppage of her Menstrue's and loss of Appetite, was thus helped: first, she
took two doses of our Pilulae Angelicae, then she took every Morning a
spoonful of Quintessence solutive, with Broth and Sugar for five or six
mornings together, after that she took every morning one spoonful of our Aqua
praeservans, by these Medicines she was cured in a short time. Phioravant.

CXXVII. A Catarrh suffocative with an Ischuria.

1. A Reverend Father aged sixty one years, of a hot humid Nature, hansom
Feature, and full well-set Body, being given to Wrestling, Ball-playing and
Bowls, would be apt to heat himself and Sweat much, which course he took for
about some eight or nine years.

2. Afterward upon a certain day he grew hot, and in the night following, when
he should have taken his rest, was taken with a suffocative Catarrh, for the
space of a quarter of an hour, by which assault, getting upon his Knees in his
Bed, he recommended his Soul to God, with folded hands.

3. He could scarce speak one word, his Breath was so stopped, and the Flux so
impetuous, at the end of which, a most cold and an exceeding great sweat all
over, (with which the Bed and the Clothes were wet) a continually weakening of
the Body daily followed, after that first assault.

4. When the Evening drew on, and the time of sleep approch'd, he was surprised
with so great a Terror in the months following, that he durst not rest one
moment, except attended by his Friends, until in time he had accustomed
himself, to a symptom, cunningly creeping upon him.

5. Twice or thrice yearly, it came again upon him in like manner in his Sleep:
the chief occasions whereof, were still almost either Anger or Sorrow, and its
declining was the same.

6. In the first year of his sickness, being beat to the ground upon the Belly
by a horse, he was for some time astonished; eight days kept his Bed, the
Prints of the bruise yet a long while after appeared.

7. Neither from that time was he seen to have a free passage of Urine, but
thrice or four times every year, to be tormented with the stoppage of his
Water, as often as he had first drunk what was cold, or when he had taken
exceeding cold upon his Feet.

8. Wherefore in the following years, he accustomed to use warm drink: after
long bathing, he went a little stooping, and by moderate riding, pist pure
blood without Pain.

9. But it fell out when he had completed the sixty first year of his age,
that he was grieviously tormented with a suffocative Catarrh, accompanied as
usually with sweat and most cold Spittle: but what never happened before, the
Catarrh terminated, and the Strangury with a vehement Pain was excited.

10. This we gave present ease to, by opening a Vein in the Arm: and three
times exhibiting the Spirit of Sal Armoniack in Broth: the Dose twenty drops:
about evening tide he made his water freely.

11. This done, he rested quietly all Night; but early the next Morning a
little before day, I caused to be administered a dose of my powder Algaroth or
Mercurius Vitae, by which he was plentifully and happily Purged; after which we
left him in perfect health. Benningerus. Cent, 1. Observe. 67.

CXXVIII. A salt Catarrh, Cough, etc.

1. A noble Matron, about the age of sorty nine years, of a hot and dry
Constitution; after daily pain of the Gout, was taken for some days with a salt
Catarrh; and begun to expectorate Blood, mixed with congealed Phlegm by Coughing,
being so weak that she was thought to dye, all Night.

2. Upon the second day, of her sickness by taking a Clyster, and a
Carduus-posset, and by applying Remedies to the Heart and Arms, she was
somewhat better; upon the third day, she used the Clyster again.

3. The fourth day, having an Inclination to Vomit, she vomited up some bitter
matter.

4. The fifth day she complained of the bitterness of her Mouth, and by an
emollient and Purgative Clyster, her Belly was loosened.

5. The sixth day she arose, making use every hour of the Sugar of Roses, and
the Syrup of Violets for the loosening of her belly: but seeing she could not
Sleep, she anointed her Crown and Temples with the Ointment of Poplar and
Roses: her Breast was anointed, as from the beginning with an emollient
Ointment; which was most Commodious.

6. The seventh day she was at rest, frequently Cough'd in the Night time,
Vomited much, her belly being freely loosened.

7. The eighth day, by the taking of the extract of Pilulae Cochiae, one
scruple and a half; made up into five Pills, she had seven Stools.

8. But when the Cough continued to molest her, and being Sick, refusing to use
inward Remedies, she was without Sleep: having Orders to wash the Soles of her
Feet at the hour of sleep, they procured her pleasant rest.

9. But she was twice taken with a Suffocative Catarrh in her Sleep, at which
very moment the term of her Life seemed ready to expire, bidding a farewell to
her Physicians; yet they were against those that apply Cupping-Glasses with
Flame to the Back.

10. The aforementioned extract given to twenty two grains, which gave five
Stools without any Griping or Pain, gave present relief; after which the
Patient daily mended, and was freed from her Catarrh. Binningerus, Cent. 1.
Observe. 74.

CXXIX. A suffocative Catarrh.

1. A Widow of 70 years, strong and full of Blood, Complaining for some time
of the Headache, was taken in her Jaws and Lungs with a salt, sharp, and thin
running Catarrh: by which she became Hoarse, and seemed to be Suffocated with a
most dry Cough, which was not broken, she enjoyed no rest, was continually
afflicted, but without a Fever.

2. Many things were applied inwardly and outwardly, to mitigate the fierceness
of the Humors, and to incrassate the thinness.

3. But she said that she could conceive manifest ease by nothing, but by the
Oil of sweet Almonds, mixed with the tabulated Sugar of Roses; by using of which
the Catarrh was stopped, the Cough, Hoarsness, and the sharpness of the Artery's
were taken away.

4. About a year after, she was taken with such a like Catarrh, and by opening
a Vein according to my direction, she grew well, her attendants watched, least
she should be taken the third time with the same Distemper, but she remained
still safe and sound. Binningerus, Cent. 3. Obs. 42.

CXXX. A sharp Catarrh, etc.

1. I was afflicted with a Catarrh falling upon my Throat and Jaws, by which my
Lungs and Wind-Pipes puffed up by little and little, drew Breath with so great
a Noise, that people at a distance might hear me painfully Breathing.

2. After that, I was forced to walk a broad in a most thick mist, and up high
Mountains, where I was surrounded with so great a Fog, that notwithstanding I
had a quick sighted Horse, and Guide expert of the ways, who accompanied me,
lead me, by reason of the darkness, through many by-ways, for the space of six
hours; so that being forced to go on Foot, Cloaked and Booted, I fell into an
exceeding great Sweat.

3. From that day, the Cough increased, by which pure Blood was expectorated,
the effect of a salt, sharp and most lasting Catarrh, with a rattling of the
Breast.

4. The Cough still increased with the rattling: afterward I Vomited up some
thick matter, congealed and mixed with a little yellowish Blood, which at last
appeared full of little Specks: sometimes I was troubled with fuliginous
Vapors, which afflicted me with so great a violence, that my Breast would seem
to be rent and torn in pieces.

5. I abstained from Wine three Weeks, and was content to live upon Ptisan made
of Barley, and Liquorice, prepared with the Seed of Annise and Coriander.

6. I purged my inward parts with Emollient and Purgative Clysters; hence by
dissolving and mixing Manna in Broth, I most conveniently cleansed my Body
three times.

7. Having opened a Vein upon the right Arm, it bled at the first time like
Hogs-lard, and the second much like, but more natural: then I applied a Cautery
to the left Arm, to the nape of the Neck, Vesicatories of Cantharides
incorporated with Leaven, and mixed with sharp Vinegar.

8. After Supper, that same day, till about the hour of Sleep, they moved me
with great desire to make Water, in so much that it can scarce be said, with
what grief and pain of the Yard I without Intermission drop by drop made Water.

9. But from that Symptom, I was delivered by an Emulsion of the Seeds of
Gourds, Cucumers and Melons made with fair Water, taking some few spoonfuls of
it at a time; it is wonderful what present and miraculous relief it gave me:
taking away all my grief.

10. Besides from the application of Vesicatories, I twice observed the earnest
desire of making Urine, to be moved in a Noble Matron.

11. I found no better Medicine against the Cough, than that of the Syrup of
dried Roses one part, mixed with Syrup of white Poppies, two parts; and this
very pleasant Electuary: Take the flowers of the dwarf Medlar, red Roses, of
each one dram and two scruples: flowers of the Sloe-tree, of the greater Dasy,
of each one scruple: Honey, fine sugar, dissolved in Rose water, of each a
sufficient quantity, mix them.

12. When I had again expectorated Blood, clammy and full of black filth, the
Electuary always seemed to be uppermost, whereby the rotten matter was cary'd
away, and at last the Veins were consolidated.

13. But the Fever and the Cough still remained; which at length too were
Cured by the frequent use of the aforementioned Medicines and Ointment: so that
by Gods Blessing, I recovered my perfect Health, who had been hindered from
visiting the Sick no less than three whole Weeks. Binningerus, Cent. 3. Observe.
58.

CXXXI. A Catarrh upon the Breast, threatening a Phthisis or Consumption.

1. A man almost thirty years old, strong of Body, was most grieviously taken
with a Cough for the space of five or six Weeks, who by a Catarrh which
tormented him in his Head, was deprived of his Taste, with a manifest pining
away, and a mild Fever, but not desirous of Drink.

2. His Brother taking care of him, gave him various Purges, Blooded him, and
prescribed him to take the Syrup of red and white Poppies, but he thought by
them his Breast was pressed, and his Spittle stopped, which a little before was
very raw and unconcocted.

3. Falling into a Consumption, wherein his Elder Brother dyed some years
before, he was thought to pine away in like manner: I going to Visit him,
according to my Duty, told him, that his whole Distemper took its Original from
the Head, and I sent him these Directions.

4. Take prepared Cantharides, one dram: bruised Mustard Seed, one scruple:
Leaven mixed with sharp Vinegar, of each a sufficient quantity, mix for two
Vesicatories to be applied to both sides of the nape.

5. Take the leaves of dry Betony, half an ounce: the seed of Gith, half a
dram: the juice of the root of white Beets, two drams: sweet Marjoram-water,
four ounces: steep it in a warm place, strain, and add Amber-grise, two grains:
and make an Errhine.

6. Take Betony leaves, Calamint, Sage, Marjoram, of each two handfuls:
Fennel-seed, half an ounce: flowers of red Roses, one pugil: Bran, salt, of
each half a handful: mix them for a Bag, to be applied warm Morning and Evening
to the Forehead.

7. After the use of this Sacculus or Bag, let the Head be shaved, and the
following Plaster applied to the Crown of the Head: Take Gum, Caranna, six
drams: Tacamahac, four ounces: beat them in a Mortar with a hot Pestle: adding
Spirit of Wine, half a dram: Oil of Amber, one scruple: after you have used the
Plaster, apply a Cephalic Cucupha.

8. Let a Fontinel, or Issue be made by a Cautery, or burning upon the left
Arm, between the Deltois and the Biceps.

9. About five a Clock at night, and three hours after Supper, let him smoke a
Pipe of dry Coltsfoot leaves: use the Trochisci sublinguales, anoint your
Breast with the following: Take half an ounce of resumptive Ointment: the Oil
of Bays, Chamomil, of each two drams: mix them.

10. Sharp, Salt things, Spices, Milk-meats, Fried meats, things hard to
Concoct, and things very Liquid are to be avoided.

11. At Supper and Dinner time, drink Claret allayed with Water between your
Meals, use a Decoction of Lentisk-wood, Sanders, or Ptisan, made of Barley, and
Liquorice aromatized with Coriander-seed, and Anniseed.

12. After Meat close your Stomach with Biscuit and Meats made of Quinces;
prevent sleeping at Midday, or immediately after Supper.

13. Being hard bound in your Belly, loose it with Clysters, shun Passions of
the Mind, and Studies; lie in bed with your Head erected, and when you lie
aside, let it be in the time of the fluxion or Rhume: These Directions were
very advantageous to him: first, the Fume of Coltsfoot and the Plaster, and by
purging his Body with the Manna, the Patient recovered his former health.
Binningerus, Cent. 3. Observe. 73.

CXXXII. A Catarrh with a continual Cough in a Youth.

1. A Youth eleven years old, was taken with a Catarrh together with a
continual Cough, and a Fever; he oftentimes Vomited up Phlegm, eat much Milk,
and made little Water.

2. After many Remedies tried, to very small profit, I ordered him to anoint
his Reins, with the Prince like Oil of Scorpions of Matthiolus, three times in
a day; by which he made Urine more freely, and the Catarrh was allayed.

3. For says Mercatus, Boys are sometimes taken with a Catarrh, by reason of
the defect and weakness of the Reins, not contracting the humor upwards,
whence it comes to pass, that what is conveyed upward becomes a Catarrh.

4. If that Symptom had continued, the same Remedies might have been used,
which Mercatus gave out in the Chapter concerning the stoppage of Urine in
Boys; as Clysters, opening Broths, etc. Riverius, Cent. 1. Observe. 55.

CXXXIII. A Catarrh in a Choleric Person.

1. I saw a sick person forty years old Choleric and lean, who was taken for
four years with a sharp and salt Catarrh, which fell down out of his Head upon
the Lungs.

2. To this Man, I applied from the beginning of his Cure, two Causticks
between the Shoulders, the Backbone coming between, for the breadth of two
fingers.

3. And I commanded, that once a Week a Cupping-glass should be applied; which
gave so great easement, by reason of his pains which every moment redounded in
great abundance, that in a manner I prescribed to him a perfect Cure. Jo.
Marsin ad River. Obs. 6.

CXXXIV. A salt Catarrh flowing to the Breast.

1. If a salt Catarrh flow to the Breast, we must use to cleanse it with Pills
of Aloes, Scamony, Coloquintida, Agarick, Bdellium, and the American Gum.

2. In making use of which 'twill be more safe if to drink first, the
preparative Whey of Goats-Milk, or Barley-water to the quantity of two or three
pints.

3. An Electuary of the Sugar of Roses, Diasebestens dissolved, Troches of
Violets, with Scamony, etc. take away the thin matter with quick Concoction.
Fortis Consult. 14. Cent. 2.

4. Capital Pills also may be taken inwardly by those that have good Blood, at
least twice without harm, made up of Pilulae Aureae, Cochiae, and Pilulae
Masticae.

5. And although Galen commends Pills of Aloes, Scamony, Coloquintida, and
Agarick to be most Medicinable in an Ulcer of the Lungs, yet those Pills
although swallowed with Whey, or Barley-Water, are to be forbidden, where there
is a great heat and dryness of the Bowels. Fortis Consult. 18. Cent. 2.

CXXXV. A Catarrh flowing to the rightside.

1. A Man fifty five years old, of a hot and moist Constitution, after many
mistakes in Meat, especially troubles of Mind, Cares and Drinking of Wine;
being also born of Parents, who were troubled with Catarrhs, was taken with a
distillation from the Head into the whole right side of his Body, with a
certain unmoveableness of the Tongue; the Arm and Leg of the same side.

2. All these Accidents were Cured by convenient Medicines; only a certain
heaviness and sense of weight in the Arm and Leg of the same side remained;
hindering him, that he was not able to go through with his usual Dutys.

3. Besides he complained of a certain impediment of the Head, insomuch that
when he cast his Eyes up or down, to the right or to the left, and placed his
Head again in its natural position, he remained as if he had been stupid, and
in a swound, yea and would stagger sometimes.

4. For the remedy of which, although he had Cauteries or Issues upon the
hinder part of his Head, and his right Arm, yet no remedy redounded from
thence, and sometimes also in Vain he used the Bath waters.

5. Prevotius with fortunate success advised him to take Physical Wines, to use
Turpentine with the Oil of Castoreum: the Decoction of Box-tree, China, viscus
quercinus, Mastich-Wood, with Sage and Chamepytis: besides Treacle with Sugar
of Roses.

6. And for outward Medicines he applied Goose-grease with she pure Spirit or
Oil of Rosemary upon Scarlet Cloth, to the nape of the Neck. Velchius, Obs. 14.

CXXXVI. A Catarrh with a Cough.

1. A Catarrh and a grievous Cough, happened to a Gentleman, about the twenty
fifth year of his Age, what he brought up he evacuated with vehemence, so that
nothing remained within him, it kept him four years.

2. Hellebor did not agree with him: but a moderate Diet, to make lean his
Body, to eat Bread, abstain from Bitter, Salt and Fat things, from the juice of
Silphium or Benjamin, from all raw Herbs, and to walk much; took no Milk, but
drunk pure Oil of Sesamus mixed with pleasant Wine.

3. Hence it is manifest, that the Catarrh proceeded not so much from the
multitude of Excrements in the whole Body, or in the Brain either, as from the
intemperature of the Brain it self, so that the Excrements, caused not the
Intemperature, so much as the Intemperature, the Excrements.

4. For if the Excrements had been the first cause of the Distemper, purging
would have been medicinal, but because the first original was Intemperature,
and an intemperate Brain, from which the very food which he took unadvisedly,
contracted the matter of the distillation; Hellebor was not advantageous, but
abstinence from meat and to pine away with hunger.

5. For the aliment so detracted, from the Brain, causing a want, there
remained less matter to distill, and the Brain through abstinence from food was
exsiccated; and in this manner it fell out, that the moist intemperancy of the
Brain was stopped.

6. Besides he received hurt from hot, sharp, salt and fat Meats, for such
besides their heat are of that quality to whet the passages of the Breath, and
cause Coughing: for sharp things are unpleasant to the Stomach; Salt things
cleanse and know; and salt causes moisture.

7. The juice of Silphium or Benjamin was hurtful, because it is very sharp or
biting, hot and windy, by which the Head was made hot and filled again with
humors and therefore the distillation run more; raw Herbs were hurtful, because
by them the thick humor Replenishing the Head is elevated: the drinking of
Milk was not convenient, because offensive to those who are troubled with the
Headache, and that for the same reason because it easily excites sorrow in
them, and therefore by those troubled with Catarrhs are to be avoided.

8. Much walking was necessary, for it causes dryness; but we must include in
due season, for any man troubled with such distempers walk to much, he
perceives more hurt thereby, then if he move not at all.

9. Rubbing also and moderate watching was advantageous, his Food was Bread
every manner of way wholesome, and harmless, except taken with immoderation: he
drunk black wine, because in my opinion it makes the moisture of the body not
so fluent, as white Wine does; but this I Question, because it is much more
replenishing then white wine, and and purges less by Urine and Sweat.

10. He likewise found relief by a potion of sweet wine, and pure and green
Sesamus: good wine is pleasant and convenient for those that are troubled with
the Cough, and those troubled with hard excrements, also Sesamus by reason of
the sweet humor which it produces; which potion is more fit for the passions
of the Breast, then for a Catarrh proceeding from the Intemperature of the
Brain: for it could give but small relief to the Brain, but 'twas so far
beneficial that nothing of the distillation remained within. Vallesius,
Comment. in loc. citat.

SCHOLIA. The THEORY of the CATARRH.
By W. Salmon, the Author of this Work.
CXXXVII. The Pathology of the Catarrh; and first of the Notation thereof.

1. The Name. It is called in Greek (...), in Latin Catarrhus; and in English
Distillation of Rhume.

2. The Definition. A Catarrh is a flux of Rhume to the Throat and Mouth,
coming sometimes from the Head, sometimes from the Lungs, sometimes from
Stomach translating the preternatural or superfluous juice to various parts of
the Body, as the Eyes, Ears, Nose, Joints, etc.

3. The Kinds. A Catarrh is commonly but twofold, one in a sulphurous saline
discrasy of the Blood, or a hot and moist habit of Body; the other, in a saline
sulphurous Dyscrasy of the Blood, or a cold and moist Constitution of the
Body, in which latter Case, it is for the most part Complicated with the
Scurvy, in the first Case, the flux of Rhume is for the most part thin, being
rarifyed by the two great heat of the Body; in the latter Case, the humor or
Rhume is for the most part thick, being condensed by reason of the too cold
habit and disposition of the Body.

CXXXVIII. The signs whereby a Catarrh may be known.

1. The Pathognomick sign or sign peculiar unto and accompanying this Disease
is the flux of Rhume to the part or parts afflicted, in the Mouth, it is known
by the perpetual filling with a moist humor, either thick or thin, and a
continual disposition to Spit, in the Nose and Eyes by a continual running of
them, upon the parts of the Throat as the Tonsilae, or Amygdallae, the Pharynx
or Larynx, the Gums, Joints, etc.

2. It is known by the Tumor or Swelling of the part, and for the most part is
accompanied with Inflammation and pain.

3. If the flux be to the Mouth and Throat, it is either gentle or violent, if
it be gentle, it Causes only a continual Spitting, but if it be fierce or
vehement, it causes a dangerous Suffocation, or at lest an Obstruction of the
Lungs, from whence often ensues shortness of Breath, difficulty of Breathing
and a vehement Cough.

4. If it falls upon any of the extreme parts, as it is known partly by Tumor,
Inflammation or pain, so likewise it manifests it self by a sudden and often
removal of the same and translation thereof to some of the other parts.

5. If it falls upon the Nerves, it is known by a pain and weakness of the part
going before, a gradual increase of the same pain and weakness, then a decrease
of the pain, with numbness and a kind of want of feeling, an increase of the
weakness and numbness, and sometimes there is added a shaking and trembling of
the part, together with a whitish kind of painless Tumor.

6. This I have observed in several, insomuch that some very Learned men have
pronounced it to be a Palsy or Paralytick affect, whereas it was nothing more
or less, but a Lymphatick flux upon the Nerve weakening the same, the stopping
and removal of which, has been for the most part, the Cure of the Disease,
without using any Antiparalyticks at all.

CXXXIX. The various Causes of a Catarrh.

1. The Causes of a Catarrh are manifold, both according to the kinds, and
according to the parts of the Body afflicted.

2. In general it is Caused by a flux of the Lympha, made sharper than ordinary
either with the Acid Salts or Sulphurous Particles.

3. If it proceeds from an acid Salt, it is caused from a hurt of the Blood in
its Crasis, whereby being dissolved by the acid Salt now in Flux, it is not
able to carry along with it, its Serum, but as it passes along up and down,
here and there, it loses the same, and if any part be weaker than ordinary,
whether by nature or accident, there it commonly leaves a Flux of Serous
humors, which late Authors call Lympha, or a lymphatick Juice.

4. Sometimes it heaps them upon the Glandules, and according to the various
position of the Body, and proximity to other parts, so they discharge
themselves, whereby a fluxion of Rhume is Caused in the said parts adjacent.

5. If the said Lympha be discharged upon the upper or lower Maxillary
Glandules, the parts afflicted with the Catarrh, are the Mouth and Throat.

6. If it be discharged upon the Brain, filling its Cavities; there may be a
flux on the Nose, Eyes, and other parts.

7. If it be discharged upon the Axillary Glandules, oftentimes the Arms,
Pleura and parts adjacent are affected.

8. If it be discharged upon the Glandules of Groin, it causes a flux upon the
Hips, Thighs, and the parts adjacent to them.

9. If upon the Glandules of the Mysentery, it causes a watery disposition of
the whole blood, and sometimes endangers a Dropsy, or other hidden and occult
Diseases.

10. But if the Blood abounds too much with Sulphur, its whole substance
becomes too much losened and dis-jointed, so that great separations of the
Lymphatick Juice are not easily made; but by reason of the excessive heat
thereof, it looses its Serum after the manner of a Vapor.

11. Whence it is, that the Catarrh or flux of Rhume is caused from a thin
matter, and has for the most part its habitation in the Cavities of the Brain.

12. So that in a sulphurous, saline habit of Body, the Catarrh is for the most
part accompanied with Vapors offending the Head in both Cases, but more
especially where the Acid Salt abounds, it may proceed from a Rupture of the
Lymphatick Vessels in the parts descending from the Head.

13. Whereby there is not only caused a great flux of Rhume in the Mouth, but
also being very fierce, vehement and plentiful, it oftentimes falls upon the
Lungs, whereby either Obstruction, Tumor, or Erosion of the part commonly
ensues, whence is Coughing, dangerous Suffocation, Ulcers of the Lungs,
Phthisicks, or a Consumption of the Lungs, that is to say, where the Catarrh
has been of long continuance, and without remedy.

14. Some say, a Catarrh is only caused from a flux of Rhume falling from the
Head, without admission of any other way of fluxion whatsoever, but this being
strictly examined, will be scarcely found probable: For as much as no passage
can be found from the Head, but by the Glandula pituitaria, and Os Cribosum,
whereby a certain passage is found to the Nostrils.

15. But there can be no reason from that cause, or way of fluxion for an
immediate and fierce Rhume to flow to the Mouth in great abundance, as is
commonly to be seen in those which have Catarrhs, immediately after drinking,
wherein the matter lately drunk, shall immediately flow by the Salivatick
passages into the Mouth, and be straight way spit forth again.

16. That it is chiefly the same liquor is apparent from this, that in spitting
the taste of the Liquor whither salt, sour, sweet, or bitter, will be always in
the Mouth, and almost as perfect as if it had not been swallowed, which alone
Consideration forces us into the thoughts of a new Theory, relating to the
Catarrh; For as much as the matter even now put into the Stomach, is forthwith
spit out of the Mouth again by a passage thorough the Salivatick Vessels, as
aforesaid.

17. The Procatartick or remote Causes, comes partly from fault of the
nourishment, and that may be known by what is Eaten, or thorough fault of the
Concoctive or nourishing faculty, the which may be known by the defects of the
Stomach, and evil disposition of the Mysentery.

18. The nourishment taken in, is either Evil, or too much in quantity, whence
often times comes Surfeting, and for the most part in a cold habit of body,
which has been fed with cold, moist and slimy Meats and drinks, excessively
taken in and ill digested, whence Vapors, Ventosities, and a sharp chylous
Juice is bred.

19. To these Causes, also we may add, a Southern Air, long sleeping,
especially in the day time, sloathfullness and idleness and taking of extreme
Colds, whereby many crude humors are engendered, which nature not aptly
disposing of them, they by a vicious quality are thrust upon other parts.

20. Cold taken by the Feet, naturally produces a Catarrh, a fluxion of Rhume
from the Brain upon the Eyes, Nose and parts adjacent, which is by consent from
the sympathy and Community of the parts, for that the cold is Communicated to
the Brain by the greatest Nerves, that come thorough the marrow of the
Backbone, whereby the innermost parts of the Brain, are immediately affected,
so as that they cannot retain their Humidities, as naturally they ought.

21. Riverius says, that a Catarrh is caused by cold, from shutting up the
external Pores, especially in those times wherein the Body ought most to Sweat,
hence it comes to pass (says he) That men very much enflamed or heated by
violent Exercise, or otherwise, running suddenly in the cold Air, are troubled
with Catarrhs.

22. Which is the reason, that this Disease is most frequent in Autumn, because
the Body being made thin, and the Pores opened in the Summer time, casting
forth many excrements by Insensible transpiration, if they be presently stopped
by Contraction of the Body with cold, do cause Humors and Vapors to fly into
the Head, and Center of the Brain.

23. So that about the beginning of Autumn, there are not only Catarrhs, but
also abundance of watery humors are sent forth by most men by Urine and Stool,
whence comes fluxes of the Belly at that time.

24. How great this evacuation by the Pores is, which is usually made by
insensible transpiration, Sanctorius has taught in libro de statica Medicinae,
where he shows that those Transpirations are larger than all the sensible
evacuations put together; so that if the Meat and Drink of one day be eight
pound in weight, the insensible Transpiration will be five pound, whereby it
appears that all the other sensible evacuations made by Urine, Stool, Mouth,
Nose, etc. cannot exceed three pound.

25. Moreover, the loss that is made by a sensible Sweat is very remarkable,
some that have gone to the Royal Bagno, have weighed themselves both before and
after Sweating, and in an hours time Sweating little more or less, have come
out ten pounds lighter, than when they came in.

26. Hippocrates says, That the Lungs being enflamed, draw humors from the
whole Body, and especially from the Head, and the Head being made hot from the
Body, spits forth that thick matter, but by what ways this humor is drawn from
the Head, the good old Man has not told us, nor can we imagine, except by those
passages by us a little above enumerated.

CXL. The Prognostics of a Catarrh.

1. It is easier to Cure in a sulphurous saline Constitution, than in a saline
sulphurous, because the ways and means of cooling a hot Constitution or habit
of Body, are much more facil than to remove a cold and moist habit.

2. If the Disease be recent, it is much easier to be Cured, than if it has
been of long standing; and it is yet more easy to be Cured in a young person
than in an old.

3. A Catarrh in an old Man or Woman, and of long standing is for the most part
incurable, and sometimes it degenerates into a Palsy.

4. If the humor (says Celsus) flows from the Head into the Nose, it is small,
if in the Jaws it is worse, if upon the Lungs, it is worst of all, and says
Hippocrates, a Catarrh is scarcely to be Cured in such as are very old.

5. The greater the Lymphatick flux, the more difficult is the Cure, and if it
be Caused from the evil disposition of the Stomach, it is so much the more
dangerous, lest the humor should flow suddenly and cause a Suffocation unawars,
or by its sharpness should prick, vellicate and excoriate the Stomach, as it
has once hapened to a young Woman a Patient of mine, the vehemence of which
Symptom is scarcely to be expressed.

6. If it immediately comes at the end of any other Disease, it is for the most
part Critical, and may be easily cured, but if it be made after a Fever, or
any other violent Distemper by translation of the matter to the Brain, it is
dangerous and sometimes mortal.

7. If it be accompanied with Hysteric fits, or with a Lethargy, Carus, or
other sleepy Distempers, it is very dangerous, if an Apoplexy follows upon it;
it is commonly Mortal.

8. If it be accompanied with Hypochondriack Melancholy, I will not say, It is
Incurable, but it may be very well accounted one of Hercules's Labors: the
Cure is also very difficult in those that are Crooked.

CXLI. The THERAPIA, or method of Cure of a Catarrh; and first of the Cure in a
hot Constitution.

1. If there be a great flux of Rhume in the Throat and Mouth, and if it be
thin and from a hot Cause, there is a necessity immediately to cool the Blood,
and the hot disposition of the parts affected, that thereby the Vapors arising
from the Rarification of the Blood, and ascending up to the Head, Brain, and
other parts, may be prevented.

2. For this purpose, it will be necessary to cool the Body by a Clyster, such
as this following: Take an Emulsion of the four cold seeds, a pint: Oil of
Roses, four ounces: Salt, two drams: mix for a Clyster; and let it be exhibited
warm.

3. Inwardly, the Body may be cooled, more especially if it be bound also, by
giving Cassia new drawn, or Electuarium Lenitivum, or syrup of Roses solutive,
with Barley-water, or Diaprunum in the same, drinking after Emulsions made of
sweet Almonds, and of the four Cold seeds, and such like.

4. And that the Derivation may be more firm, it will be good to give this
following Liquor for the ordinary Drink of the Sick: Take Emulsion of sweet
Almonds, a gallon: pure sal Prunellae in Powder, three drams: fine white sugar,
three ounces and half, or more, according as the sick likes it in sweetness,
this Salt will intimately mingle it self with the Blood, and quench all
preternatural heats; although it will most signally make the Flamula vitae burn
more clear, it may be drunk to a quart a day.

5. Riverius commends this following Purge: Take of the best Rhubarb, four
scruples: yellow Myrobalans rubbed, with the Oil of sweet Almonds, half a dram:
yellow Sanders, half a scruple: infuse them in Lettice and Purslane-water, and
strain it, adding of Manna and syrup of Roses solutive, of each one ounce: mix
and make a Potion; instead of the aforesaid Waters, you may use if you please a
Decoction of cold Herbs and Tamarinds.

6. The second Intention, is to condense and thicken the humor: Take syrup of
the juyces of Lettice, Purslane and Plantane, of each four ounces: Emulsion of
the four greater cold seeds, syrup of Corn Poppies, of each six ounces: syrup
of Violets, and of red Roses, of each an ounce and half: mix them, and make a
Julep to be taken Morning and Evening, two ounces, more or less, according to
Age and Strength, at a time.

7. Or instead thereof, the Sick may take Diacodium solidum, which may be eaten
now and than all the day long; taking at Night this following Dose: Take syrup
of Poppies, six drams: syrup of Lettice, two drams: Emulsion of the cold seeds,
two ounces: mix them for a draught.

8. If these things do not, we must come to such as are more powerful, among
which are our Liquor Vitae Anodynus, or Confectio Anodyna, our Laudanum, the
Liquid Laudana of Schefer and Helmont, the Trochisci de barbaris cum Camphora,
and the Narcotick Pills of Platerus.

9. Outwardly, pickled Herrings may be applied to the Soles of the Feet, the
Temples and Forehead may be anointed with Vnguentum Populneum, mixed with a
quarter part of Oil of Nutmegs by expression, Or you may apply this: Take Oil
and Vinegar of Roses, of each two ounces: the Whites of two Eggs; beat them
very well together, and Embrocate the Head therewith, applying afterward a
piece of Rose-Cake dipped in the same.

10. This following is commended, as an excellent thing to cool, thicken and
sweeten the humors: Take spring water, six ounces: or if you please, Almond
Milk as much: sugar, one ounce: the Yolks of two new laid Eggs, beat them very
well together, and stir them upon the fire, which is to be taken as hot as
conveniently it can Morning and Evening, for three days.

11. The following I know by manifold experience to be good: Take Conserve of
red Roses, four ounces: the whites of two Eggs: the levigated Powder of Amber,
one ounce: Powder of Olibanum, six drams: white Terra sigillata, three drams:
mix all well together by beating in a Mortar, of which let the Sick take the
quantity of a Wall-nut, Morning Noon and Night.

12. Lastly, as the most excellent and admirable of all things, and that by
which this Cure must be Consumated, is the continual taking of the Oils of
Salt, Sulphur or Vitriol in all the Liquor the Sick Drinks.

13. Platerus commends this in all Fluxes and Defluxions: Take Emeralds
prepared, a dram and half: Male-peony seeds husked, extract of
Male-peony-roots, of each two drams: red Coral prepared, three drams: Salt of
Coral, one dram: Wood of Aloes in powder, two drams and a half: biting
Cinnamon, seeds of Sorrel, of Purslane, of Docks, of Misleto of the Oak,
Cochinel, or grains of Kermes, of each two drams: Pearls prepared, Hartshorn
philosophically prepared, of each four scruples: Salt of Pearls, one dram:
extract of Saffron, eight grains: mix them with juice of Citrons, or Quinces,
three ounces: and let them ferment in the Sun or by the fire, and after keep it
close stopped for use.

14. If the Catarrh has concomitant with it a Diarrhoea, you must use Medicines
for both, especially when a salt or sharp water flows from the Brain to the
Stomach; first, have respect to the Defluxion; then to the Diarrhoea. As to the
Defluxion purge not with strong Medicines, but gently by Nose and Mouth: Divert
by washing the Feet with hot Water, and Decoctions made of Cephalicks and
Astringents; use also Frictions and Cupping-Glasses; and strengthen the Head by
Emplasters and Fumes: of which see more in the Cephalaea, Falling Sickness,
Apoplexy and Palsy.

15. Then for the Diarrhoea, purge the Stomach gently, then strengthen it;
using also things which are astringent.

16. If the Catarrh proceeds from a hot distemperature of the Blood, you ought
to purge with gentle things, as syrup of Roses, Cassia, Manna, Catholicon,
Diaprunum, Tryphera Persica, etc. Or this, Take Rhubarb, four scruples:
Spicknard, half a scruple: infuse in water of Iva arthritica, or ground pine,
strain, dissolve some of the even now ennumerated things therein.

17. This following is said to cleanse and purify the Blood: Take Hops,
Fumitory, of each a handful: Cordial flowers, a pugil: Sebestens, number
twelve: Tamarinds, half an ounce: Liquorice rasped, three drams: Polypody, half
an ounce: Sena, two drams: Epithymum, Time, of each one dram: make a Decoction
in a sufficient quantity of Water: strain and infuse therein Rhubarb, one dram:
yellow Myrobalans, a dram and half: Spicknard, a scruple: strain again, and mix
therewith syrup of Roses, an ounce: or Catholicon, or Triphera, half an ounce:
make a Potion.

18. Or this: Take Cheb, yellow, and Indian Myrobalans, of each an ounce:
Polypody, an ounce and half: Raisons stoned, number forty: Cordial-flowers, two
drams: Spicknard half a dram: infuse in Wormwood-water; boil a little, and
strain, to which add juice of Roses, six ounces: Manna, four ounces: Sugar, two
ounces: dissolve for a Potion. Dose three or four ounces at a time.

19. Joel commends this Cholagogue: Take choice Rhubarb, a little bruised, a
dram and a half: Tamarinds cut small, half an ounce: Succory-water, six ounces:
mix and digest for a night, then boil it a little, and strain it strongly out
by expression: to the strained Liquor add Pulp of Cassia newly drawn, one
ounce: or syrup of Roses solutive, two ounces: make a draught to be taken warm
at five or six a Clock in the Morning.

20. After due purging, this may be taken every morning fasting: Take Conserve
of Roses, an ounce: species Diatragacanthum frigidum, three drams: powder of
Olibanum, two drams: powder of Amber, fine Bole in powder, of each one dram:
with syrup of dried Roses, make an Electuary.

21. In the day time, for change, as ordinary Drink this may be taken: Take
sweet Almonds blanched, three ounces: Pompion seed husked, one ounce and half:
Melon seeds, one ounce: white Poppy and Lettice seed, of each half an ounce:
beat them together, and with a sufficient quantity of Barley-water, or
distilled water of Milk, make an Almond Milk: of which make Barley Cream, by
adding two pounds of the pulp of Barley, and a small quantity of white sugar,
boiling them a little: of this he may take eight or ten ounces at a time, once
in the Fore-noon fasting, and as much once in the Afternoon, between Dinner and
Supper, and if he so like, he may put in a few drops of the Oil of Sulphur or
Vitriol.

22. At last, at bed time, he may either take Pilulae e styrace. Or this
following, which Benedictus Faventius used with good success: Take juice of
Liquorice, two drams: washed Aloes, one dram: Pilulae de Cynoglosso, half a
dram: syrup of Violets, enough to make a mass of Pills: Dose a scruple at bed
time. Or instead thereof you may give my Laudanum, which in my Opinion is
inferior to no Medicine of like kind in the World.

23. Lastly, as a principal Topic, this following Emplaster may be applied to
the Coronal Suture: Take Turpentine of Chio, Mastich, Frankincense, of each one
dram: Gum Elemi, a dram and half: Gum Sandarach, Olibanum, red Coral, red
Roses, Myrtles, Balaustians, Pomgranate-peels, fine Bole, all in powder of each
two drams: with Oil of Roses, and Wax, of each a sufficient quantity make an
Emplaster: which spread upon soft Leather, or linen Cloth, to be applied, as
aforesaid.

CXLII. The Therapia, Or method of Curing, a Catarrh in a cold and moist habit
of Body.

1. In the Cure of a Catarrh proceeding from a cold and moist Cause, you are to
consider, whether it be gentle, or fierce, flowing down with violence.

2. If it be gentle, it is the more easily cured, and is commonly performed by
Interceptives, or things having a thickning and astringent force, which are
either Cold, as Purslane, Lettice, Cucumbers, Poppies, of all sorts, Opium and
other cold things: among stones, prepared Emeraulds have a great name, for they
stop all sorts of Fluxes in any part of the Body whatsoever.

3. Those things which thicken and dry are all sorts of Gums, chiefly Gum
Arabic, Tragacanth, Frankincense, Olibanum, Mastich: and among Woods, Juniper,
Guajacum, Sassafras, Rosemary, Oak, yellow Sanders, wood of Aloes, and wood of
the Balsam-tree.

4. The herbs and plants may be prepared into a syrup, by taking their
clarified Juyces and boiling them to a syrup with fine sugar or honey: Opium
may be made into a Confect or Laudanum, as we have almost in an hundred places
declared: these various Woods, among which we should have also enumerated
Lignum Nephriticum are prepared for Medicine by boiling them in water and
making a decoction either strong or weak according to the Intention, examples
of which we have often given in the decoction of Guajacum.

5. A strong decoction of Sarsa, is very profitable in an Acid dyscrasy of the
Blood, and sweetens all the sower humors, beyond Immagination.

6. As for Lignum Nephriticum, it is prepared only by a simple Infusion, in a
very gentle heat, in half Wine and half water, the use of which drives the
humor downwards, and carries it partly off by Urine.

7. In the Morning fasting therefore, the Sick may take this following
Electuary: Take Conserve of Red roses, six ounces: mucilage of gum Tragacanth
in Wine, two ounces: levigated Powder of Amber, one ounce: fine powder of Gum
Animi, of Mastich, with choice Olibanum, of each six drams: Powder of Nutmegs,
Zedoary, of each half an ounce: Extracts of Contra yerva and virginia
Snake-root, of each two drams: mix them together, and with sufficient quantity
of the juice of Alkermes, make an Electury to be taken to the quantity of a
Chestnut every Morning fasting, and if you so please, last at night going to bed.

8. The ordinary drink I would have prepared from Guajacum, Sassafras, Sarsa
and China with Carminative-seeds; For that this Diet mightily drys up the cold
and moist humor causing the Catarrh.

9. This Diet also may be prepared by a bare Infusion in a strong Limewater,
which has power to draw forth all the Internal properties of these simples, by
which also the Diet it self will be made more powerful.

10. This drink I would have taken at least four, five, or six times a day: at
night going to bed, things more powerful and thickning ought to be given,
because then the Spirits being at quiet, all the powers and faculties of the
Body, Conspire with the Medicament to overcome their Adversary, to wit, the
Disease.

11. Among those things which are principal to this purpose we commend, syrup
of juice of Willow-leaves, the syrup of the juices of Purslane, Lettice and
Poppies, syrup of Diacodium liquid or solid, or syrup of Myconium are famous
for this purpose, they may be taken mixed with Plantane, damask Rose, or
Poppy-water, for they Incrassate the thin humor admirably; they may be given
for some Nights.

12. But if by reason of the continuance of the Disease, they be not strong
enough to overcome it, there is a necessity to have recourse to stronger
Medicaments, among which are the Liquid Laudana of Helmont and Scheffer, our
Guttae vitae Anodynae, and Liquor Vitae Anodynus, any of which may be given
from fifteen drops to thirty, just at lying down, after which the Electuary
before described may be taken.

13. Moreover Apophlegmatizers are mightily commended by Decker, For that says
he, they do best of all draw forth the thick Lympha, among which those
Commended in the Cure of Apoplexies are very profitable, and the roots of
Master-wort, by which the thick Lympha, which is indeed a pituitous matter, is
drawn forth, that the Morbifick matter of the Catarrh may be wholly taken away,

14. And then the Pills de Cynoglosso may be taken at night going to bed, a
gentle purge proceeding, by the use of which the Catarrh will be Cured.

15. But to confirm it more effectually, it may be good to receive up the Head
by the Mouth thorough a funnel, the fumes of the following Suffiment. Take
Amber, a dram: Mastich, a scruple: mix them and make a gross Powder, a little
of which is to be cast upon Coals, and the Fumes received, as aforesaid; or
they may be drawn up by the Nostrils, the Head being first covered with a
Mantle, or some such like things, so will the Disease vanish to admiration.

16. Barbet commends this, for a defluxion into the Ears; Take Cows-milk, a
sufficient quantity: Laudanum Opiatum, three grains: mix them, and put two or
three drops into the Ears, applying outwardly a piece of hot Bread newly taken
out of the Oven.

17. In a defluxion from the Eyes; the same Barbet Commends the following: Take
a Hens egg, boil it to a moderate hardness, cut it in halves long way, take
away the yolk and put into its Cavity Sugar of Saturn, six grains: Camphir, two
grains: white Vitriol, eight grains: all in powder: honey of Roses, half an
ounce: put the parts of the Egg together for two or three hours, then strain
out the Liquor hard, of which let a few drops be put into the Eyes twice or
thrice a day.

18. Where the defluxion is thinner and sharper, he says nothing is better than
this: Take flowers of Cincum, a scruple and half: Rose Water, a sufficient
quantity: mix them and drop thereof into the Eyes.

19. This Cincum is a Kind of Tin, the best of which is to be had in England,
and Barbet says, It is Chymically prepared by a fourth degree of heat, but the
true preparation thereof we have taught in our Doron Medicum, lib. 1. cap. 25.
sect. 153.

20. These flowers Decker commends in Excoriations of the groins in Infants,
caused by sharpness of Urine, as also in the Excoration, Chaps, and
Exulcerations of Women's Paps.

21. Thus far of a gentle Catarrh, but if it be very fierce and vehement, we
must give those things that will more powerfully root out the matter: Frst, It
will be necessary to derive the matter downwards by the following Clyster: Take
Mallows, Herb Mercury, Beets, Marjoram, Origanum, of each half an handful:
Flowers of Camomil, Melilot and Dill, of each one pugil: Rosemary, two pugils:
Caraway-seeds, half an ounce: cut, bruise and boil them in a sufficient
quantity of water to the Consumption of the half: strain and take of this
Decoction, twelve ounces: Hiera simple, one ounce: Infusion of Crocus
Metallorum, six drams: Benedicta Laxativa, half an ounce: Oil Olive, three
ounces: Salt, a dram: make a Clyster: which cast into the Bowels warm.

22. Afterward you may purge with Colocynthis, which may be given in Powder,
Decoction or Tincture; It purges the Brain admirably and strongly, and indeed,
all other parts of the Body: and may be repeated three, four, five, or more
times with due Intervals between Purging.

23. Riverius says, It may be steeped in Urine to take away the bitterness of
its taste, and so it may be given to the quantity of a dram, which will work
very gently; I know it to be a very good remedy.

24. But this preparation of Riverius, in my opinion quite spoils it; For it
diminishes above three quarters of its Virtues; it is best given unprepared in
Tincture; the preparation whereof we have taught in our Doron Medicum, it may
be given from six drams to an ounce and half, according to age and strength.

25. If the Catarrh having been of long standing proves stubborn, or Exercises
its fury in a Melancholy habit of Body, it is necessary you should often give
the Liquor Catharticus, the preparation of which you have in our Pharmacopaea
lib. 4. cap. 11. sect. 26. It purges all cold, serous and melancholy Humors
out of the whole Body; It may be given to three or four ounces in the morning
fasting.

26. Joel Commends this, Take Diaphaenicon, six drams: Diacatholicon, half an
ounce: Waters of Betony and Hyssop, of each two ounces: mix them, let it be
taken warm early in the Morning.

27. Or in place thereof these Pills following may be taken: Take Pil. Cochiae,
de Agarico of each two scruples and half: mix them together, and with honey of
Roses make twenty seven Pills: let them be swallowed with some fit Liquor in
the morning fasting, for three doses; but if the Sick be not strong half the
quantity may be given at one time.

28. The body with these or the like Medicaments, ought to be purged at certain
distances of time, in the intermediate days, the parts afflicted ought to be
comforted with Corroboratives; among which this following is commended: Take
Diamoschu dulcis, Diambrae, of each half a dram: Dianthos, a scruple: pouders
of bitting Cinnamon, of Cubebs, of Mace, of each two scruples: white sugar
dissolved in Juniper water, four ounces: pure Oil of Lavender, fifteen drops,
oil of Cinnamon, seven drops: make a Confect, which form into Morsels or
Lozenges, according to art: dose the quantity of a small Chestnut three or four
times a day.

29. Or thus: Take Conserve of Rosemary-flowers, four ounces: Venice Treacle,
three ounces: Powder of Nutmegs, Amber levigated, of each one ounce and half:
powder of Cloves, and Cinnamon, of each three drams: Olibanum in powder, two
drams: mix them and with syrup of staechas a sufficient quantity make an
Electuary: Of which the quantity of a large Nutmeg may be taken in the morning
fasting, an hour before dinner, and about four a Clock in the afternoon.

30. Now by reason of the fierceness and vehemence of the Disease; we are not
to be wanting in any thing, which may contribute to the removal thereof; for
which purpose, it will be good to make Revulsion, by application of
Cupping-glasses, Vesicatories, the Seton, and making of fit Issues, the parts
to which these may be applied are chiefly, the nape of the Neck, hinder parts
of the Head, the Shoulders, Arms, Thighs, and Legs.

31. Zacutus Lusitanus, Commends Issues, made behind the Ears, as the best
remedy against Catarrhs falling from the Head, and Riverius says, he has seen
very good Effects from them in defluxions upon the Eyes.

32. The chief Vesicatories applied in this Cause are Flamula, Crow-foot,
Daphnoides, Capsicum, Nettles, Milk of figs, Milk of spurge, spanish Flies
mixed with Leaven, etc.

33. Errhines also are of good use, Joel commends this: Take juice of red
Beet-roots, juice of Marjoram, of each half an ounce: mix them, and let it be
drawn up the Nostrils, warm for three days together.

34. Or this of Riverius: Take lignum Vitae, one ounce: springwater, one pint,
infuse it all night upon warm Embers, and boil it to a Consumption of the half:
adding near the end of the boiling, sweet Marjoram, and red Roses, of each two
pugils: strain out for a Liquid Errhine.

35. Or this: Take sweet Marjoram-water, four ounces: juice of Betony, one
ounce: Nigella or Gith-seeds in powder, half a dram: Nutmeg in powder, a
scruple; Musk and Ambergrise, of each two grains: mix them for an Errhine.

36. But the dissolution of one scruple of Euphorbium in three or four ounces
of white Wine, transcends them all.

37. If the fluxion be thin, you may use Masticatories, such as this following:
Take Mastich, half an ounce: roots of Pyrethrum, three drams: Cubebs,
Carraways, of each two drams: seeds of Staphs-acre, one dram: bruise them
grossly and mix them: in the morning fasting a pugil of this powder may be
Chewed in the Mouth, the Nostrills being stopped, it draws forth the morbifick
matter powerfully.

38. This following is more gentle, and may be given to the more delicate
Bodies: Take Nutmegs, one dram: Mastich, and gum Tragacanth, of each half a
dram: Powder of the two first, and with the latter dissolved in a small
quantity of Rose Water, make Troches to Chew, being first thoroughly dried.

39. But the most excellent and profitable of all Masticatories is Gentian
root, being constantly chewed in the Mouth every day almost from morning to
night, it evacuates the morbifick Cause, strengthens and fortifies the Brain
and Stomach with all its Faculties, quickens the Animal Spirits, exhilerates
the Heart, and notably recreates the whole Man.

40. By the only use of this Medicament, I knew two persons cured of the
Falling Sickness, and several of a Vertigo, which shows the Medicament to be no
mean thing.

41. A Sternutatory proper in this Cause may be thus made: Take powder of black
Hellebor, an ounce: powder of white Hellebor, half an ounce: Nutmegs, two
drams: powder of Cloves, half a dram: Musk, half a scruple: pure white sugar,
fourteen drams: mix them, it is a very excellent thing.

42. Riverius says, there is a new place found out, viz. in the Neck near the
Jugular Veins between the Muscles, where if a Cautery be applied, it cures to
admiration, and by this means he says, that two men had been Cured of old
Catarrhs, which caused hoarsness.

43. If the whole habit of the body abounds with moisture, or where a Dropsy is
feared, it will be good that the Patient, after due purging, as before
mentioned, should sometimes Sweat, which may be provoked with proper
Sudorificks, such as this following: Take Mithridate, and venice Treacle, of
each one dram: Bezoar mineral, fourteen grains: Volatile salt of Hartshorn,
half a scruple: mix and make a Bolus.

44. After the taking of it let the Sick swallow this: Take choice Canary three
ounces: Treacle water, one ounce: Aqua Caelestis, half an ounce: mix them: Or
this which alone Sweats very powerfully: Take Tinctura diaphoretica Paracelsi,
mixtura simplex, of each six drams: mix them for a Dose, after which if you
please, you may take a draught of Carduus Posset.

45. This following Bolus sweats powerfully: Take Viper-pouder, a dram:
Volatile Salt of Amber, Bezoar mineral, of each half a scruple: Mithridate,
enough to make them into a Bolus: give it at night, and let the Sick be
carefully attended, for it Sweats powerfully.

46. But if by reason of the very great frigidity of the Body, and Icy
disposition of the humors, the former things, prove ineffectual, you may
certainly provoke Sweat with this following Compositum: Take Bezoartick-water,
of Langius, one ounce: Prophylactick water of Sylvius, half an ounce: of our
Gutae vitae, or the Liquid Laudanum of Helmont, from twenty five to forty
drops: mix them, this will not fail Expectation.

47. Or in place thereof you may give Tinctura diaphoretica Paracelsi cum opio,
the preparation of which you may see in our Doron Medicum, lib. 2. cap. 7.
sect. 8. it is as Excellent a Sudorifick as is ordinarily to be met with;
expelling tartarous Diseases, the Scurvey, Pox, Dropsy, Jaundice or Gout; it
melts Icy and Resinous kind of Humors, expelling Wind from all parts of the
Body, to strong bodies it may be given, from two scruples to two drams, or more
as need requires.

48. The body being thus purged and cleansed, it remains now that the parts
afflicted, together with the whole Humane frame, may be so strengthened, as for
the future to resist and repulse, all future fluxions, and also that the habit
of the body may be so altered and mended, and the mass of Blood so purifyed,
sweetened and enlivened, that the generation of the Catarrh may be prevented.

49. For which purpose, Corroborating Alteratives, sweeteners of the Blood, and
things thickening may be prescribed, as the decoction of Mastich-wood, which is
mightily Commended and is thus prepared: Take Coriander-seed, half an ounce,
bruise them: Mastich wood rasped, six ounces: boil in a gallon of water to the
Consumption of a third part, sweeten it with pure white sugar, and let it be
ordinarily drunk hot as they drink Tea.

50. These Troches of Solenander, are mightily commended by Physicians, and I
have had a large Experience of them: Take choice Frankincense, Spanish juice of
Liquorice, of each one dram: Thebian Opium, English saffron, red Myrrh, of each
one scruple: with syrup, of Poppies, make troches or pills to be taken now and
then two scruples or half a dram at a time.

51. Take white sugar dissolved in Rose Water, ten ounces: Conserve of red
Roses, one ounce: Coriander-seed, half an ounce: Nutmeg, Frankincense, of each
three drams: Powder of Liquorish, Mastich, of each two drams: Cubebs, one dram:
make a Confection in little Rouls, each weighing three drams: dose one of the
Rouls, morning and evening.

52. Take Mithridate, Venice Treacle, of each two ounces: Confectio Anodyna,
one ounce: powder of Amber, Frankincense and Mastich, of each half an ounce:
mix them and with syrup of Corn poppies, a sufficient quantity make an
Electuary, dose from two scruples to a dram and half, or more.

53. Take Venice Treacle three ounces: sugar dissolved in Rose Water, six
ounces: Lac sulphuris, three ounces: Oil of sweet Marjoram, twenty drops: mix
them, and make a Confect for Rouls or Lozenges: Dose two or three drams thrice
a day, this is a mighty thing in drying up the Catarrhous humor in what part of
the Body soever.

54. Also it heals Ulcers of the Lungs arising from a sharp Lympha.

55. If these things prevail not, we must come to the use of Narcoticks, of
which these following have been often proved Pil. de Cynoglosso may be given at
night going to bed from half a scruple to a scruple, Pills of Storax may be
given from eight grains to sixteen or more, Nepenthes Opiatum may be given from
four grains to half a scruple.

56. Pil. Bechicae is given from six grains to ten: and in the same Dose may be
given pil. Narcoticae Plateri: Phylonum Taracensi Galeni is given from a
scruple to half a dram.

57. Mynsicht his Opiated Confect may be given from five grains to ten: Our new
London Treacle, may be given to a scruple the Requies of Nicholas is given from
a scruple to two scruples.

58. The Common London Treacle may be given to half an ounce or more at a time:
the Phylonum Magistrale is given from four grains to eight or more; the
Phylonum Romanum is given from a scruple to a dram.

59. The Phylonum Persicum from two scruples to four scruples or a dram and
half: Trochisci Albi Rhasis with Opium, according to Joubertus, are a good
thing, For they cool Inflammations, deterge, stop fluxions, dry, heal, and
strengthen, Dose from one dram to two: Trochisci Alkekengi are given from three
scruples to four scruples.

60. Troches of Amber from a scruple to a dram: Troches of Sanders from a dram
and half, to three drams: and Troches of Terra Lemnia, from one scruple to two.

61. The Liquid Laudanums of Helmont and Scheffer, may be given from twenty
drops to forty, so also Our guttae vitae, and Liquor vitae Anodynus: The
Laudanum of Peter Faber, is given from three grains to eight; so also cum
Pearlarum preparatione.

62. The Laudanum Paracelsi, is given from one grain to six, also our great
specific Anodyn, the making of which you may see in our Doron Medicum, lib. 2.
cap. 8. sect. 7. may be given from one grain to six, seven, or eight; it stops
all Catarrhs and fluxes of Rhume, after a very speedy and excellent manner, and
is indeed inferior to none of the things before ennumerated.

63. All these last mentioned things being Opiates, are to be taken at Night
going to Bed, the next Morning, the Stomach, Head, Brain, and Animal Faculties
are to be corroberated with some of these following things:

64. The Wood of Aloes, may be given from half a scruple to a scruple or more;
drinking after it a glass of choice Canary: Trochisci Cypheos made for
Mithridate are good to be given from a scruple to a dram: and Trochisci Aleptae
Moschati are commended by many Physicians and not without Cause; for they
fortify the Brain and noble parts, are Pectoral, Cordial and Cephalic, good
against Epilepsies, Apoplexies, Vertigo's, Lethargies, Megrims, Catarrhs,
Asthma's, Phthisicks, fainting and swooning fits.

65. Troches of the Wood of Aloes, may be given from half a dram to a dram and
more in Conserve of red Roses, to these you may add the species Alexipharmicae
nostrae, our Pulvis Antepilepticus, our Cordial species, and the pulvis
Alexipharmicae Barbetti, species Diasulphuris Mynsichti, species Diaolybani
Mynsichti, pulvis polycrestus Imperialis Mynsichti, Electuarium ad tabidos, and
Electuarium Stomachicum Mynsichti.

66. And this following, which by experience is thought to transcend them all:
Take Musk in fine powder, two scruples: Ambergrise in fine powder, one scruple:
Civet, half a scruple: mix them; and with Oil of Nutmegs by expression a
sufficient quantity, make a mass, for four or five Doses.

67. If a Catarrh be conjoined with Hysteric fits, you ought always to mix
with those, things proper against a Catarrh, Antihystericks, of which kind the
Trochisci Hysterici are said to be very good; so also the flowers of Tin mixed
with Conserve of Rosemary-flowers, and taken.

68. The Troches of Myrrh are magnified by some, as also the Powers of Amber,
and Wax. Or this, Take Cubebs, Anacardiums, Calamint, Rosemary, Nutmegs, of
each one dram: Myrrh in fine powder, Castoreum in powder, Ambergrise, of each
half a dram: Musk, one scruple: Oil of Savin, ten drops: with natural Balsam, a
sufficient quantity, make Pills: the Dose one dram at a time.

69. They comfort and fortify the Head, Brain, Stomach and Womb, they
strengthen and restore the Memory when lost, expel Wind, and recreate the
Animal Spirits.

70. As for Topics, all the parts afflicted ought to be Bathed, twice a day at
least, with Powers of Amber, or Rosemary, of Oranges and Limons, of Sassafras,
or such other like Cephalic, Hysteric and Aromatic things, in which also
about an eight part of Camphir ought to be before hand dissolved.

71. The Hair also ought to be Shaved off the Head, and a Plaster strongly
attractive or drawing, made of Burgundy Pitch, Venice Turpentine, and a fit
quantity of the Oil of Nutmegs, spread upon soft Leather or Cloth is to be
applied.

72. The parts afflicted ought to be Fumed, with a Suffiment made of Amber and
Mastich, and if the Catarrh be from the Head, the Fume ought to be received up
by the Mouth through a Funnel.

73. So also in all cold Diseases of the Head; for that they are stubborn and
rebellious: And an unwearied Care is to be taken, till we are certain they are
perfectly rooted out, and therefore all those Medicaments which we have
ennumerated in the Cure of a Cephalaea, coming from a cold and moist Distemper
of the Head, may be used here.

74. And besides the Diet we have prescribed to be made of Guajacum, and other
Woods: and Spiced Wines would be good to be drunk now and then, to strengthen
the Stomach, comfort the Heart, and refresh the Animal and Vital Spirits.

75. In this Case, some commend the Vinum Sanctum, which is indeed a good
thing, especially where a Palsy, Cachexy, Dropsy, or the Relicts of the French
Disease are to be feared.

76. The Wine of Pope Adrian is of singular use, being taken after a small
quantity of Our Electuarium ad Tabidos, in the Morning fasting.

77. Others commend Vinum Claretum Stomachicum to be drunk from two ounces to
four ounces; also the Vinum Claretum Praestantissimum, the Vinum Absinthiacum
Laxativum, of which four ounces may be taken in the Morning fasting.

78. The Vinum Stomachicum Mylij is of approved use, taken to three or four
spoonfuls upon any illness of the Stomach, but the Vinum Moschatum Mynsichti,
exceeds them all.

79. It is a Medicament of wonderful force in reviving and recreating of the
Heart and Spirits, it fortifies the Brain, and comforts all its Internal
Faculties; it strengthens the Nerves and their Original, it drys up cold and
moist humors in what part of the Body soever; chiefly in the Head, Stomach,
Bowels and Womb, resisting Fainting and Swooning fits, palpitation of the Heart
and suchlike; it Cures a stinking Breath to a Miracle, although it proceeds
from an old and rotten Catarrh, and powerfully strengthens and fortifies all
the Internal Viscera, a spoonful or two of it may be drunk at a time, viz. in
the Morning fasting, and an hour before Dinner.

80. If the Body be at any time bound, it ought to be loosened with the Vinum
Absinthiacum Laxativum before mentioned, or with the Vinum Sacrum ex Hiera,
which see in Our Doron, lib. 2. cap. 12. sect. 2.

81. The famous Gregorius Horstius commends this following Powder for
strengthening of the Stomach: Take Coriander, one dram: Mastich, biting
Cinnamon, white Sanders, of each three drams: Sugar, the weight of all: make a
Powder: Dose after eating half a dram; with a Toast in generous Wine.

82. His Morsels against the Catarrh: Take Nutmegs, choice Olibanum, of each
one dram: Mastich, Powder of Liquorice, of each two scruples: Hartshorn
prepared, one dram: Coriander-seed, one dram and half: old Conserve of Roses,
six drams: Sugar, eight ounces: dissolve in Rose Water, and make a Confect in
Morsels. At night going to Bed, he orders Crato's Pills de succino to half a
dram: the preparation of which you have in Our Pharmacopoeia, lib. 4. cap. 23.
sect. 29. you may increase the Dose if you please to one dram, or more.

83. In the decrease of the Moon, he advises, The Head to be Bathed with this
Lixivium: Take roots of Assarum, leaves of Betony, Thyme, Sage, Rosemary,
Lavender-flowers, of each one handful: Cloves, Nutmegs, Frankincence,
Orrice-roots, of each two drams: Sena, half an ounce: Agarick, two scruples:
Ginger, Anniseeds, of each an ounce: Bay Leaves, one pugil: boil all in a
Lixivium made of Vine Ashes; with which Bath as aforesaid.

84. For a thin Catarrh and hot, he advises to Lohoch de papavere, Syrupus
papaveris erratici, of which the quantity of half a spoonful may be taken.
These Trochisci sublinguales may also be held in the Mouth: Take white
Poppy-seeds, one dram: Gum Tragacanth, Arabic, white Starch, red Coral
prepared, juice of Liquorice, of each one dram and half: Melon seeds husked,
Purslane-seed, of each two drams: sugar Penids, sugar of Roses tabulated, of
each one ounce: make Troches with syrup of Poppies.

85. At length the following restorative Morsels may be taken: Take sweet
Almonds blanched, two ounces: Pine nuts, Pistich nuts, of each half an ounce:
species Diatragacanthon frigidum, Diapenids, of each one dram: juice of
Liquorice, half a dram: Sugar, one pound: dissolve in Coltsfoot water, and
make a Confect in Morsels.

86. Take Hogs Blood, four pound: Coltsfoot, Scabious, of each two handfuls:
Conserve of Roses and Borrage, of each one ounce and half: Coltsfoot water,
fifteen ounces: mix and distill in Balneo: sweeten the Water with Lozenges of
Sugar tabulated: Dose one or two ounces, fasting in the Morning.

87. Another Water, thus to be made: Take the Lungs and Liver of a Calf, of
each, number one: Crabs, number ten: Capons flesh, one pound: Crumbs of
Wheat-bred hot, eight ounces: roots of Succory, of Asparagus and Fennel, of
each two drams: Turmerick, half an ounce: Rhubarb, six drams: Indian spicknard,
Cinnamon, Camels hay, of each two scruples: species Diarrhodon Abbatis, Troches
de Rhabarbaro, de Eupatorio, of each three ounces: Agrimony, Dodder,
Hart's-tongue, Wormwood, Carduus benedictus, Centory the less, of each one
handful: Liver-wort, Dandelion, Endive, of each half a handful: the four
greater cold seeds, one ounce and half: Anniseed, two drams: flowers of Borrage
and Bugloss, of each half a handful: red Roses, one handful and half: Waters of
Agrimony, Carduus benedictus, Carduus Mariae, Coltsfoot, Succory, Endive, of
each half a pound: distill and cohobate for the space of two days: Dose Morning
and Evening three or four ounces. See more of this Disease in the second
Edition of Our Synopsis Medicinae, lib. 3. cap. 29. sect. 24.

CHAP. V. Of the FALLING SICKNESS.
The AUTHORS Observations.
I. THe Falling Sickness in a Child of a Week Old.

1. This Child was brought into the World with Convulsions, but they seemed not
to last long, but were overcome by the Power of Nature, from these fits it was
free six or seven days, after which it fell into a fit of the Epilepsy, which
although we could not distinguish from any other Convulsive Motion by the
falling of the Child, yet it was sufficiently apparent by the foaming of the
Mouth.

2. There was immediately given this following Composition: Take choice Canary,
three ounces: Musk, six grains: mix them and digest for a day: This was given
to the Child about a quarter of a spoonful at a time, three or four times a day.

3. A second fit siezed it, observing which, we found the right side a little
Contracted: I advised, that the Vertebrae of the Neck, and hinder part of the
Skull, should be Bathed with the Powers of Amber, which was accordingly done
very gently.

4. I ordered also the Continuation of the former Wine, by the use of which two
things alone the Child was perfectly recovered.

II. The Falling Sickness in a Girl of fourteen years of Age.

1. This Girl had four years, or more been troubled with this Disease, being of
a fat and corpulent Body, pale Complexion, smooth skin and extremely well
Featered, her Parents applied themselves to many Physicians, but they all
mistaking the Cause, exhibited their Medicines in Vain.

2. But this Maiden, from her Infancy up till she was between nine and ten
years of Age, had been troubled with a continual running of the Nostrils, which
by some accident or occasion was stoped, after it had been stoped half a year
or somewhat more, she fell into the Falling sickness.

3. From whence I did Conjecture, that a cold pituitous matter lodged in the
Cavities of the Brain, might be the Cause thereof, for which reason sake, I
exhibited to her the following sharp Clyster.

4. Take Mutton-broth, twelve ounces: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, three
ounces: Tincture of Colocynthis, half an ounce: Oil, two ounces: mix and make a
Clyster; this wrought four or five times upon her, whereby her Body seemed to
be sufficiently opened.

5. I also made a Revulsion, by applying a Vesicatory to the Crown of the Head,
which being healed up, I applied others to the Soles of the Feet, whereby a
strong derivation was made.

6. Six days after, I gave her this Vomit: Take syrup of squils, an ounce and
half: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, half an ounce: extract of black Hellebor,
a scruple: dissolve, mix, and give it early in the Morning fasting; this gave
her eight or nine pleasant Vomits; and brought forth a very great quantity of
green viscous matter; after which she seemed more lightsome and pleasant.

7. Four days after this Vomit, I gave her this following Purge: Take Pilulae
Rudij, a dram: Colocynthis in powder, a scruple: Resin of Jallap, ten grains:
with syrup of Peony, make a mass, adding six drops of the Oil of Lavender,
divide it into four Doses to be taken every fourth Morning.

8. The purging being over, I gave her my Specific Antepileptick Powder, which
was given from a scruple to half a dram.

9. Notwithstanding all this, sixteen days after she had another fit, but much
more gentle than the former, and of shorter continuance; I then gave her a Dose
of my Carthartic Argenteum, viz. one whole dram, mixed with six drams of the
Syrup of Squils, this made her to Vomit stoutly, and to bring up a great deal
more of that filthy, viscous, eruginous matter.

10. Afterward I gave her this following Powder: Take powder of the roots and
seeds of Male-peony, of each one ounce: Bay Berries, Zedoary, Rosmary, of each
half an ounce: Misleto of the Oak, six drams: Peacocks-dung, 4 drams: Musk,
native Cinnabar, of each two drams: Ambergrise, one dram: make a fine Powder
and mix them: Dose from a scruple to a dram every Morning and Night going to
bed.

11. But by reason there was a stoppage in the Head, of a certain Rhume which
used to flow out by the Nostrils; I caused these following Errhines to be
administered: Take White Wine, six ounces: Euphorbium, four grains: dissolve the
Euphorbium therein, and let the Liquor be Injected up the Nostrils; this
brought much filth that way.

12. Afterward, I caused her to use the following solid Errhines: Take
Confectio Hamech, half an ounce: fine Pouders of Scammony, of Cambogia, of
Agarick, of each two drams: Powder of Colocynthis, Ginger, of each half a dram:
Euphorbium in very fine Powder, ten grains: mix and make a mass of solid
Errhines, of which little Rouls may be made to put up the Nostrils.

13. These I made her use every Night, or every other Night, a little before
she went to bed; she kept them not long in her Nostrils, because I desired not
that they should draw very strongly, but I made her use them often, to accustom
the humidities of the Brain, to make a passage through the Nostrils, which
Current had been stopped for full four years.

14. And that every thing might be made more firm, I applied again Blisters to
the Soles of the Feet, by which a great quantity of Water was drawn out of the
Head, by the use of these means afore-treated, within three months time, she
was perfectly well.

15. Another Maid, about sixteen years of Age, was siezed with the Epilepsy, as
the former: several things were tried, without success, afterward her Parents
sent for me; I looked upon her, but conceived her to be past recovery; however
I was urged to give her something.

16. I first purged and cleansed her Stomach, then I removed the Obstructions
of the Head; I gave her things to comfort and fortify the Head; and such things
as were specificks, so counted by all Physicians; but all these things were
done in Vain; for after five Weeks time, she dyed in one of her Fits.

17. Being Dead, a large quantity, supposed to be more than a pint, of a thick
glutinous matter flowed from the Nostrils, after which came a little Blood.

18. From hence in part the Conjunct Cause of the Disease may be seen, but how
things were within, we cannot tell, her Parents not being willing to have her
opened.

III. The Falling Sickness in another young Woman about twenty years of Age.

1. This person had been afflicted with the Falling Sickness for above two
years and a quarter, she was of a sanguine Complexion, a very pleasant
Creature, but yet hitherto never had her Courses; which I conceived to be the
principal Cause of her Disease.

2. What her other Physicians gave, were mostly Specificks against an Epilepsy,
not reguarding at all to bring forward the Course of Nature. I was sent for,
and upon enquiry finding the Obstruction aforesaid, I forthwith gave her these
following Pills: it being about eight days before the change of the Moon.

3. Take fine Aloes, two drams: Resin of Jalap, Castoreum in fine Powder, of
each half a dram: mix them, and with syrup of Garden Tansy, make a mass of
Pills: adding also six or eight drops of the Oil of Savin, of this I gave her
twenty five grains every Night for four Nights.

4. After which I gave her this following Powder: Take Zedoary, round Birthwort
roots, Bay Berries, of each one ounce: Borax, Dittany of Creet, Saffron, of
each one dram: seeds of Nigella, Calamint, dried Savin, of each half an ounce:
red Myrrh, Jallap, of each two drams: make a fine Powder, and mix them: Dose
from half a dram to a dram, every Night going to bed.

5. By these means the young Lady, came to the benefit of Nature, and her
Courses came down laudably, to wit, in good Proportion and Color.

6. This being done, I emptied her Stomach with a gentle Vomit, then I drew
Blysters upon both her Feet, so that the Disease which used to come once a day,
came not above once a Month, whereby I was encouraged to proceed further.

7. I gave her the following Powder: Take native Cinnabar, Man's Skull, Misleto
of the Oak, of each a like quantity: mix them in a fine powder, and take it
from half a dram to a dram every Morning.

8. At night going to bed, she took sixteen drops of the spirit of Man's Skull,
in Canary, by the continual use of which things she became well, and so
remained for the space of two years.

9. But accidentally being affrighted, she was siezed with the Epilepsy again;
at what time my help was again requested, after due purging, I gave her my
magistral Epileptick Powder, which she took from a scruple to a half a dram
every Morning fasting.

10. Also I caused her Head, being first shaved, to be anointed with this
Anti-apoplectick Balsam: Take Oil of Nutmegs by expression, one ounce: Chemical
Oils of Savin, Rosmary, Sage, sweet Marjoram, Amber, Sassafras, of each one
dram: mix and make a Balsam for the Head; with this her Head was anointed
gently Morning and Evening, as also the Vertebrae of the Back, for the space of
twelve days.

11. The Epilepsy went off from her, and she grew Paralytick in her right hand,
which we restored by anointing with the Balsam aforementioned; after which we
applied Emplastrum de Galbano Crocatum Mynsichti; by which applications she
became perfectly free from all her aforesaid Diseases.

IV. The Epilepsy in a Man thirty four years of Age.

1. This Man had been for four or five years vehemently afflicted with the
Epilepsy, and given over by most Physicians, as Incurable; after Trial of many
things, as aforesaid, I gave him a strong Vomit made of the Infusion of the
glass of Antimony, by which his Stomach was exceeding well cleansed.

2. Afterward I ordered him to take the Lunar Pills once a Week, for four
times together, by means of which a vast quantity of humors were evacuated out
of the Body.

3. And by reason I was fearful that the Viscera should be too much weakened by
so much purging; I ordered him to take our Electuarium ad Tabidos, every
Morning fasting, the quantity of a Nutmeg, and as much at Night going to bed.

4. These things went not without their success; for there was not only a
plentiful evacuation of the humor made, but there was a Corroberation of all
the Faculties and Functions of the whole Body.

5. Yet notwithstanding all this, we could not say, Our Patient was cured, or
in any seeming hope of Cure; however I dispaired not, but entreated him to go
on, that we might make the utmost Trial that could be.

6. I caused his Hair to be shaved, and a Vesicatory to be laid all over the
whole Head, by which many large Blisters were drawn; these Vesicatories I
repeated no less than four times.

7. Afterward I gave him such things as were Specificks in the Cure of this
Disease; as this following: Take Misleto of the Oak, one ounce: Cinnabar of
Antimony, half an ounce: Volatile Salts of Amber, of Hartshorn and of Man's
Skull, of each half a dram: Peacocks dung, one dram: Powder of Male-peony roots
and seeds, of each two drams: Cocheneel, Saffron, Ambergrise and Musk, of each
one scruple: mix and make a very subtle Powder; of this he took from half a
dram to two scruples every Morning fasting, and every night going to bed, in a
glass of black Cherry-Wine.

8. But by reason he complained of a great illness of his Stomach, want of
Digestion, and loss of Appetite; I ordered him to take the Antepileptick spirit
of Vitriol, in all the Liquors he drank, by means of which the Faculties and
Functions of the Stomach came to be restored, and his digestion strengthened,
so that he could eat with a strong Appetite.

9. Yet notwithstanding all this, his Epilepsy remained, however I advised him
to continue the use of the means, and gave him encouragement and strong hopes,
because the strength of his Disease declined every day: moreover, he had not
one fit, where he used to have two before.

10. These things tired our Patient so much that he resolved to take no more;
for although his Disease was not so strong, as it was when I took him in hand,
yet nevertheless the tediousness of the Cure brought him into despair; however
this advantage he had by the Medicaments he took, that whereas before he used
to have fits almost every day; it would be a Week, and sometimes a fortnight
between each Paroxysm, which to me would have been so much matter of hope and
satisfaction, that I should have certainly continued the use of the means to a
perfect Cure.

11. However a Cure did succeed, after a while though not by my means; for
being in his Barn, accidently he fell down and broke his Head, so that there
was a Fissure of the Skull.

12. A Chyrurgion was forthwith sent for, the Man was taken up for Dead; when
the Wound came to be searched, the Artist found a large Fissure in the Skull; I
being by, he asked my advice, I concluded upon opening the Skull, without which
he was certainly a dead Man.

13. The thing was forthwith very dexterously done, and the Sick became cured,
not only of the Contusion and Wound, but also of his Epilepsy which had so long
afflicted him; for by that Breathing place, the noxious Humors and Vapors had
vent or passage.

14. I advised him to keep it open as long as he Lived, he followed my advice,
and lived ten years after, free from the Falling Sickness, or any other
distemper of the Head.

V. The Falling Sickness in a Girl caused by a fall.

1. This Girl being at Play with some of her Play-fellows, fell down from a
Considerable height, whereby her Shoulder, Head and hinder part of her Neck was
extremely bruised; she was taken up for Dead, but being carried home and got
into her bed, she quickly came to her self again.

2. After which, a Chyrurgion applied Cupping-glasses with scarification to the
bruised parts; by means of which, a great deal of black bruised Blood was drawn
forth, and in a short time after, all the bruised places of the Shoulders, Neck
and Head, were made perfectly well.

3. However, about twelve or fourteen days after, near the new of the Moon, the
Girl was taken with a fit of the Epilepsy, with a great crying and roaring out,
a forcible falling to the Ground, and a foaming at the Mouth.

4. These fits came every two or three days; at the end of each fit, there came
out of her Nostrils, about half a spoonful or better of clear viscous water, by
the appearance of which, I Judged the Cavities of the Brain to be offended with
a watery Humor, the Evacuation of which might conduce to the restoaring of her
to perfect Health.

5. I Caused her to take the Solid Errhines mentioned in some of the former
sections; also the Liquid Errhine made of a small quantity of Euphorbium,
dissolved in white Wine, which draws forth the Excrements of the Brain, from
the very hinder parts of the Head.

6. These were several times exhibited with due Intervals, and to the Head
being shaved, was applied the Epileptick Emplaster of Franciscus Valesius.

7. Inwardly, the humor was derived by a decoction of Sena and Rhubarb, in
which a little Cream of Tartar was dissolved, which purged her well and
effectually, after purging I gave her Crato's Epileptick powder, which she took
every Morning fasting.

8. Her drink was that mentioned in the former section, made of Guajacum, sarsa
and sarsafras; the which she drunk with a prohibition from all other Liquors,
and by the Use whereof she found much good.

9. I caused her Head to be shaved, and for twelve or fourteen days to be
Bathed morning and night with the powers of Amber, either alone or mixed in
Equal quantity with the powers of Oranges and Lemons: by which the Brain and
nervous parts were comforted.

10. Also I ordered her, to take about two drops of the Oil of Rosemary; or
rather twenty drops of the Powers of the same in all her Guajacum diet, which
warmed dried and comforted the Head and Brain.

11. The using of these things caused an apparent Abatement of the force of the
Disease, and in length of time, an absolute Cure.

12. However after the fits seemed to have left her, they Returned again, but
at larger distances of time, to wit, about six months, I advised, to the
assiduous Use of the same Medicaments, concluding, that that which had so far
weakened the Disease, as to make the Intervals of each fit to be five or six
Months, would if constantly followed, totally take away the same: and so it
proved, she continued the use of these things for three months, or more, after
which she was perfectly Cured; nor so far as I know had ever another Paroxysm.

VI. An Epilepsy in an Ancient Man, mortal.

1. This Man being sixty three years of Age, was siezed with the Falling
sickness: as he was a rich man, so nothing was wanting toward a Cure; nor did
he spare any Cost for to attain his wished for Health.

2. Several Physicians had him in hand, and many things were done, as Cupping,
Blistering, Bleeding, Purging, Exhibition of specificks, but all to no purpose,
he dyed in the fourteenth fit, at which time I was sent for,

3. Immediately, concluded him Incurable, as soon as I saw him; of which
opinion I was, partly because of his great years, and partly because of the
vehemence and long continuance of the Paroxysm.

4. And indeed it was the longest, For he never lived to have another, but dyed
as was supposed as he was Coming out of the fit; at which time he Used two or
three short words of Prayer, and so gave up the Ghost.

5. After he was Dead, the body was opened, as also the Head; As to those
Viscera in the Breast and Abdomen, he might truly be said to be Eusplanchnous,
that is one of sound Bowels, but the Cavities of the Brain abounded with a
watery humor, which at first was clear and viscous; but being Cold, thickish
and white.

6. And in the fore Ventricle of the Brain, was found a small Blader of water:
as for the substance of the Brain, it was free from any contamination, we could
discern, save its Vessels were very full of Blood; from which Experiment and
Observation, something more of the Cause of the Epilepsy is to be understood.

7. Another ancient man was seized with the Epilepsy, who also dyed in a fit,
when his Head was opened, nothing was found within the Cortex of the Brain,
which might be called a preternatural matter, but only an Abundance of moist
humor; the Brain it self as it were overcome and contaminated with a moist,
viscous Juice.

8. Also a Woman about fifty years of Age, was taken Epileptick, she lived
three Months, in which time she took many Medicaments, nor in that space was
there any probable means neglected, at length she dyed of a fit.

9. After she was dead, there was a great flux of Blood at Nose, her Head being
opened, the Cavities of the Brain were found filled almost with Blood, which
could not be, but by a mighty Concussion of the Brain: in which through the
Violence of the Agitation some of the Blood-vessells; chiefly the Arteries
thereof, must be broken.

10. Indeed the whole Head was so full of Blood, when it was opened, that by
reason thereof, we could not make any singular Inspection into any other parts
of the same.

11. A Child also about a year and half old, was seized with Epileptick fits,
and dyed in its fourth fit: the Head being opened, the whole Brain was so
contaminated, that it seemed to be nothing but a mass of filthiness and
putrefaction.

12. Many of the like Examples we have seen; but the most of those which were
of grown years, and dyed by force and violence of the Disease, had either a
bladder of water lodged in the Cavities of the Brain; or the said Cavities were
repleat with a watery humor, or the substance of the Brain was continued with a
viscous humidity.

VII. The Falling Sickness in a little Boy.

1. This little Youth by reason of a fright, fell into fits, not very unlike
those, which we call Fits of the Mother, which fits by degrees and length of
time degenerated into a true Epilepsy.

2. The Child was the only hope of its Parents, and Heir to all their Fortunes,
which made them so much the more concerned for his Cure, he first fell into the
Hands of several Men of great repute and fame for their Learning, but chiefly
for their knowledge in Physic, these men did him no good at all mistaking the
Cause of the Disease.

3. For when he was a little Infant, he had a sore in one of his Legs near the
Ankle, this drying up, or being healed by Art, without purging, brought upon
him an evil habit of Body, so that he often complained of a heaviness or dull
pain of his Head.

4. From whence I conceive, that the Disease might rather be caused from the
Translation of the matter to the Brain, than from any fright, how great and
sudden soever, though I believe Nature might take advantage thereby to make the
first manifestation of the Disease, and no further I believe it to be a Cause.

5. The first thing I did in order to this Cure, was to make a couple of
Issues, the one, on the same Leg where the Sore formerly was, the other on the
Thigh of the other Leg.

6. This done, I applied Vesicatories, first to the Soles of the Feet, then to
the Nape of the Neck, upon the Vertebrae thereof, also I made a gentle kind of
Revulsion by Sternutatories and Errhines applied to the Nostrils.

7. I purged him gently with Sena, stewed with Prunes, which was repeated five
or six times, and was, indeed, all the purges I gave him.

8. Afterward, I caused him to take my specific magistral Antipileptick
Powder, and to continue the same for two or three months.

9. His Drink, I ordered to be a Decoction; made as follows: Take Guajacum,
Sarsa, Sarsafras, China-root, Liquorice all rasped, of each half a pound:
Raisons of the Sun, blew Currants, of each a pound: Anniseeds, Carraways,
Parsley-seed, all bruised, of each two ounces: make a Decoction in sixteen or
twenty quarts of Water; boil a third away: then strain, sweeten with sugar, and
with Ale-Yest, being warm, work it up, when cold and settled, bottle it up.

10. This was his constant Drink, during the Cure, and by the means of which
things, he was perfectly restored to his Health; outwardly his Head and Legs
were anointed often with the Apoplectick Balsam mentioned in the former Cure.

VIII. The Falling Sickness in a Melancholy Woman.

1. This Woman was about thirty five years of Age, neither fat nor lean, of a
Melancholy habit and constitution of Body, which Melancholy though it was
continual, yet seemed to have certain Paroxysms, wherein the Melancholy
disposition became stirred up to a height; if not to a Frenzy, yet to a
Foolishness, when the fit was over, she would be as rational and sensible as
ever, but yet very Melancholy.

2. After she had been in this Condition four or five year, she was taken with
a Vertigo, which usually came once or twice a Month, and commonly a little
before the Melancholy fit, this Vertiginous Distemper grew stronger and
stronger upon her, so that at last she would fall down, but retaining her
Senses, and as yet without any symptom of the Epilepsy.

3. But as the Disease grew stronger, and the fits more numerous, so at length
she seemed to fall with a kind of Convulsion, this continued upon her about a
quarter of a year.

4. Some judged it to be the Falling Sickness, others not; however the
principal Symptoms of an Epilepsy were absent, yet notwithstanding in length of
time, by the continual increase of the Disease, the fit siezed her with a
forcible falling down and foaming at the Mouth, by which the Disease first
specified was confirmed.

5. After that she had several Fits, irregular as to their Intervals, but they
at length became more certain, and siezed her only upon the change, full, and
quarters of the Moon, whereby she was a little forewarned of the time of their
coming.

6. Moreover she would say, That she knew of the coming of the fit, two or
three hours beforehand, by reason of a certain alteration which she found in
her Head, which is no usual thing.

7. She would complain of a dullness and heaviness of her Head, and although
not much pained of a Vertigo or Giddiness, by which things did not seem so much
to turn round, but rather topsy turvey, heels over Head, so that she would
often complain, though she sat never so securely, that she was falling
back-ward:

8. By which it appeared, that the conjunct Cause of the Disease lay in the
Occiput or hinder part of the Head, and assaulted the Noble Ventricle or
Original of the Nerves, which was confirmed the more; for that when she fell,
she fell not sideling, turning as it were a little round, and as is usual in
this Disease, but all together backward, so that upon the approach of the
Paroxysm, she would often cry out, some body was pulling her backward.

9. As to the Cure hereof, many things were attempted, but altogether in vain;
several Physicians delivered their Judgment, that she was Incurable, grounding
their Opinions upon the Authorities of Hippocrates and Galen, that if an
Epilepsy happened to any one above the Age of twenty five, it was always
Incurable.

10. However notwithstanding these great Oracles, the contrary was proved upon
this Patient, though indeed the Cure was difficult: many Methods and Processes
were used in vain, being long and tedious and several-years under Cure, yet at
last it was happily accomplished, as in the sequel of this History you may
perceive.

11. This Woman had been for a long time without her Courses, to wit, three or
four year, and it was the opinion of her former Physicians, that if they were
produced, or an equivalent quantity of Blood taken away instead of them, that
it was possible she might be Recovered.

12. According to this advice, she was several times let Blood, and
several-times even to Fainting; so that it was supposed several quarts of Blood
was taken from her.

13. By this means she seemed to be much better for a considerable space of
time, as to the Epilepsy; but she was made more pale, wan, thin, and lean than
before, and her Melancholy Distemper seemed rather to increase, for the
diminition of the Blood was no doubt the diminition of the Spirits; forasmuch
as the Blood is the Vehicle of the Spirits.

14. However though the fits seemed to be absent for a very considerable time,
yet they were not totally removed, for after four months time, they returned
again with much greater violence.

15. Whereupon the Doctors advised her to the same course of Bleeding again,
which she and her Friends were unwilling to; for that she had been so much
weakened by the former bleeding, and that not yet recovered: they also saw, that
the fit returned with so much the more violence by how much she was weaker,
which could be no encouragement to such a kind of Cure.

16. She had also taken several things inwardly, whereby she had such a
loathing and aversness to any thing of Physic, that it was difficult to
persuade her to the taking of any more; so that what we were to do, we were
forced to do chiefly by outward application, which was no small discouragement
to the hopes of a perfect Cure.

17. Her Husband however earnestly required my help, and did at length engage
me in this so difficult an undertaking: by reason she was so averse to inward
means: my Consultation was, what outward Courses were to be used, as most
probable to do her good; at length I concluded upon applying Vesicatories to
the Soles of her Feet, which I did, repeating them several times; to wit, five
or six times, and it was done to a very considerable advantage of the Sick.

18. For although the Epileptick fits were not taken away thereby, yet they
were much diminished, as to their vigor and time of continuance, also that
which was most remarkable of all, that they saw often, reiterating of the
Blysters, totally removed the Melancholy humor, and from a dull, heavy,
unpleasant, melancholy Creature, she became very lightsom, lively, pleasant and
merry.

19. And whereas she had formerly complained of a pain in her left side, and
Hypochonder, which was not very extreme, but a dull, slow kind of pain, and
what she said, she could well endure, provided she was free from her fits; yet
upon so often repeating of these Blysters, this pain went also quite away.

20. She was apt to be bound in her Body; which I constantly kept open with a
Laxative Clyster; wherein some ounces of Crocus Metallorum was put, or a
spoonful or two of the Tincture of Colocynthis.

21. These brought a great quantity of cold, watery, slimy, and pituitous
matter: these were reiterated every day, or every three or four days; as
occasion required, for a Month together, whereby the Bowels became well
cleansed of a sharp, acrimonious humor; so that she seemed to be exceeding
pleasant, and to grow every day more cheerful than other.

22. After this, I thought of other ways of Revulsion; I caused two large
Vesicatories to be applied, one upon each Shoulder; these, after healing, I
reiterated twice.

23. I also caused two Issues to be made, one in each Arm, in the Brauny part
above the Elbow; they ran freely and well, and vended a large quantity of
matter.

24. These things being done, I caused the Hair of her Head to be shaven off,
and I applied a Vesicatory over the Head; this also was repeated three times,
after which her Head was very lightsom and pleasant; also a dimness of Sight,
which she had for some years complained of, was perfectly taken away and cured;
so that she confessed her self to see as well as she ever could in all her Life.

25. Her Head being healed, after the application of the third Vesicatory; I
caused the Seton to be applied to the nape of the Neck, putting a Skein of Silk
thorough the hole, this was kept open, and running for above four Months; and
to her Head being shaved, was applied the Epileptick Emplaster of Franciscus
Valesius, which she wore a long time.

26. In all this time, we could not prevail with her to take any thing
inwardly, save the following Diet, which she took for her ordinary Drink: Take
Water, twenty quarts: Guajacum rasped, a pound: Sassafras, half a pound: boil
to the consumption of six or seven quarts: then add these following things:
take Sarsa, Lignum Rhodium, of each six ounces: boil again for half an hour,
after which add Misleto of the Oak, Male peony-roots and seeds bruised, of each
four ounces: Carraway and Coriander-seeds, Nutmeg, of each two ounces: boil
them a while, then strain all out hard by pressing: to the strained Liquor add
juice of Male-peony-flowers, a quart: Virgin Honey, enough to make it sweet,
mix them well together; and whilst yet warm, add Ale-yest, a pint: let it work,
putting these following things into it in a Bag. Take Rosemary,
Lavender-flowers, Sage, Bawm, sweet Marjoram, of each a handful:
Juniper Berries well bruised, four ounces: put all into a bag with a stone in
it, in the time of working: where let it stay about six days, till it is fit to
bottle, after which it may be bottled up, putting into each bottle, half an
ounce, of white Sugar, and one Clove, or a piece of Limon-peel.

27. Of this drink, she drank about a bottle a day, and sometimes more, for six
whole Months together, to wit, from the first of our taking her in Hand: by
reason of this drying Diet, and the many evacuations that were made, the
Epileptick fits grew fewer; they came more seldom, and stayed a much lesser
time; so that in the sixth month after the undertaking of this Cure, she had
not one in seven Weeks, whereas formerly she used to have one every Week; to
wit, every quarter of the Moon, so that indeed it was matter of encouragement
to go on.

28. I at last of all prevailed upon her to take the following Confect: Take
Electuarium ad Tabidos, two ounces: Volatile Salt of Man's Skull, two drams:
Volatile Salt of Hartshorn and of Amber, native Cinnabar, Peacocks-dung, of
each one dram and half: with syrup of Alkermes, a sufficient quantity; mix and
make a Confect.

29. I ordered her the continual taking of this Electuary for three or four
Months at least, which she exactly performed: also if her Body was at any time
bound, that she should keep it open with the forementioned Clysters.

30. And with much persuasions, I gained upon her to take now and then a Purge
of Sena, made by boiling it with Prunes, the syrup of which she took without
any disgust, and it purged her very well.

31. Also I ordered her, that once a quarter at least, if not oftener, she
should apply Vesicatories to the Soles of her Feet, because they so powerfully
attract from the Head, and empty the universal Body of all sorts of humors.

32. Upon the provoking of the Terms, she had a sharp pessary put up, and she
swallowed every night going to bed, about four or five nights before the time
that the flux was expected, Pills of washed Aloes half a dram; and after them
about the time of expectation; one ounce of the Tincture of Colocynthis.

33. By means of which, and the Pessary aforesaid, her Terms were effectually
brought down, and she confessed she found much benefit.

34. Now whereas she complained, that when the Epileptick fit came upon her, it
was as if she had been pulled backwards, I caused all the hinder part of her
Head, and nape of the Neck; as also the whole Backbone it self from the
Vertebrae of the Neck to the Os Coccigis to be very well bathed twice a day
with the Powers of Amber alone, and sometimes with the Powers of Amber mixed
with the Powers of Rosemary, Sage and Sassafras.

35. These were constantly used for five or six Weeks, by which she found not
only her Head and Brain comforted, but her whole universal Body warmed and
strengthened.

36. Thus was this supposed incurable Creature, after a long use of Medicaments
perfectly restored to Health, although but a very few Medicines were given
inwardly; and she remained well and free from Epileptick fits, for several
years; nor do I know that she was ever troubled with them after.

37. In this observation there is somewhat worthy of remark, to wit, an old
Hypochondriack Melancholy was totally abolished, or taken away, by only drawing
Blysters at the Feet, without the use of any Internal Medicament.

IX. An Epilepsy, acconpanied with the Scurvy.

1. There was a young man who was for several years troubled with the Scurvy,
and last of all, taking cold in the wet; he fell into an Epilepsy about
midnight in in his bed.

2. He was of indifferent gross Body, flaggy hair, smooth skin, and of
phlegmatic habit of Body.

3. Those fits when they first took him, came now and then, but afterward by
degrees they seized more and more upon him, until they came two or three times
a day, whereas formerly they came but once a week, sometimes twice, sometimes
once every other day.

4. They came constantly with an exceeding Crying out and a great fall, the
Physicians which had him in hand, took away a great deal of Blood from him,
almost to fainting; but that did no good.

5. They likewise purged him, with several things, but all in vain; For the
Brain was so weakened, and the passages so straightened, that without the
strengthening of the one and opening of the other, there could be no hopes of a
Cure.

6. I Chose such a Medicament that had both these properties, to wit the
tincture of Luna, of which I gave eight or ten drops Morning and Evening in a
glass of wine: moreover I purged him with Pil. Lunares, three or four grains at
a time; which was Administered once or twice a week, according as the Exigency
required.

7. But whereas the Epilepsy fell in a Scorbutic habit of Body;
Antiscorbuticks were Essential to this Cure, without which it could not be well
performed.

8. Take spring water, twenty pound, Guajacum, sarsa, sarsafras, of each half a
pound: boil all together to the Consumption of a third: Coriander-seed,
Rocket-seeds, Mustard Seed, of each three ounces: put them in just at the last
boiling; let the Liquor stand till it is almost cold, then strain, and add
these following things; Juniper Berries bruised, half a pound: juice of
Scurvy Grass, Brook-lime and Watercresses, of each ten ounces: mix them
together, and with a pint of Ale-yest, work them all up; and having done
working; let it be put up into Bottles, as you did the diet in the former
section.

9. The constant taking hereof will alter the habit of the Body, and by degrees
take away the Scurvy, and be the cause of the rooting out of the other Diseases
also.

10. For if an Epilepsy comes upon a Scorbutic habit, it is Impossible it
should be cured till the evil habit be clearly removed.

11. He also drank now and then in his Broth, a few drops of Tincture of
Antimony; which has an Essential power against this Disease.

12. Lastly, over the futures of the Head I caused to be applied Franciscus
Valesius his Epileptick plaster, and in a short time he became well: this
Caution is always to be obsered, not only in the Scurvy, but in all other
Diseases concomitant with the Epilepsy, that those things good against those
Diseases, be always mixed with Antepilepticks.

X. An Epilepsy in young Woman from a disaffection of the Stomach.

1. This Disease had long layn hid or secret, nor did it make it self manifest,
till it had got singular advantages on the Animal spirits, afterward it
assaulted the young Woman, after an exceeding violent manner, and with so great
a pain and weakness of the Stomach, that she her self, nor the standers by
thought she would live.

2. Sometimes she was so sick as to Vomit a great deal of green Choler, and
sometimes a great deal of tough viscous and yellow Phlegm: after which she would
be well for several days, as if she ailed nothing.

3. From whence it appeared that the Cause was really lodged in the Stomach;
upon her next complaining, I provided for her the following Dose: Take Infusion
of Crocus Metallorum, six drams: salt of Vitriol, two scruples: mix them, and
give it her warm; this gave her eight or nine several easy Vomits.

4. This vomit I repeated the fourth day following: after which I gave her
several specificks, as the Tinctura of Luna, spirit of Hartshorn, and salt of
Hartshorn, spirit of Sal Armoniack, and such like, all which were of a
singular good Use for the pain of the Stomach.

5. After these things were done; her Courses came down, nor were they stoped
any more.

6. To her feet I applied Blisters, which made a good Revulsion of the matter;
and I now and than caused her to take a Glass of spiced wine, upon any Illness
or faintness of the spirits, chiefly that of Pope Adrian, whereby the weakened
Nerves are restrained to their former strength.

7. Her diet was that common to the household, nor could a little Irregular diet
hurt her, by Reason she stayed not long upon it.

8. Nor can indeed change of diet create any evil habit of Body: nothing can do
that unless it has been long used; because the Stomuch being nourished and
cherished by things which it likes, poduces a good and laudable Chyle, and a
good Chyle, a good Blood, whereby health of Body is attained at last.

9. This young Gentlewoman by looking upon another wishly, at the time of her
falling down, caused her also, as it was thought, to fall into the same
Disease; and some think it is done by the Effluvia of the Eyes, wherein the
Venom of the Disease is secretly conveyed.

10. But whether it did or not, I will not here determine, though it is the
absolute opinion of many great Philosophers, and some Circumstances are so
strange that a man can scarcely misbelieve it, without doing a great deal of
violence to his Reason and Understanding.

11. Much such an Example does Platerus give in his observations; which thing
is well worth the Considering.

XI. A simple Epilepsy Originally in the Brain.

1. A Youth, fifteen years of Age, had been more than six or seven years
obnoxious to an Epilepsy, he was of a fresh color, sanguine Complexion, great
high spirit, and of a singular Wit and Ingenuity.

2. The disease crept upon him by little and little, the fits being very gentle
at first, afterward more Extreme: when they had held him about two years time,
they left him for a year of their own accord, without Physic: but by being
accidentally frighted, after an Interval of about fifteen months space, they
afflicted him again, with an exceeding deal of violence.

3. The youth was sensible of the fit before it came, and would Cry out, Oh,
it is now a coming! when he was come to himself again, he would declare how its
approach was.

4. First he felt a lightness and swiming in his Head, which made all things
seem as if they turned round, presently after his Head would be dull and heavy,
and he would suddenly be taken with a Convulsion, as though his Neck and
Soulders would be drawn together, whereupon he immediately fell with violence,
foaming mightily at the mouth.

5. I beheld him in several of these fits, but that which is more Admirable is,
that these fits should visit him four or five times in a week, and sometimes two
or three times a day, and then all of a sudden, so to leave him, that he should
be without them for a month or six weeks together.

6. For which space of time he would seem to be perfectly well, being as merry
and brisk as if he had never ailed any thing; and then of a sudden without any
known or praevious Cause, to fall into the same again, with all the force and
vehemence immaginable.

7. The reason of this Phenomenon I might give here, but I design to do it in
another place, to which I shall refer you, however the method of the Cure, and
by what I performed it, was as follows:

8. In the first place, I caused Blisters to be laid to the soles of the Feet,
because they universally, and also in a special manner derive, from the Head,

9. His head being shaved was morning and evening anointed with this following
Balsam: Take Oil of Nutmegs by expression, two ounces: Liquid storax, Chimical
Oils of Amber, Rosemary, and sweet Marjoram, of each two drams: Chimical oils
of Lavender and Sage, of each one dram: mix and make a Balsam for the Head:
with which it was anointed morning and evening, for near half an hour together
before hot Embers.

10. After which was applied over the whole Head, the Epileptick Emplaster of
Franciscus Valesius, by which the Head, the Brain and the original of the Nerve
were mightily comforted and strengthened.

11. This constant drink was this following: Take spring water, twelve quarts:
Missletto of the Oak, Rosemary, Sage, Betony, Bawm, winter-savory, Thyme,
Hyssop, Mint, of each three handfuls, Angelica, Tansy, Rue, of each one
handful: bruise all gently: and boil them in the Liquor, to the Consumption of
two quarts, or more; then strain it out by pressing, to which add Juice of
Plantain and Taragon, of each a quart: mix them with the decoction, then put
thereinto a bagg with Juniper Berries well bruised, four ounces: seeds and
roots of Male-peony, of each six ounces: Caraway and Coriander-seeds, bruised,
of each one ounce and half: put all into the bag with a stone in it, which put
into the Decoction, making it work with the Ale-yest, having first made it
pleasant with honey or sugar.

12. After it had done working it became the youths constant Drink, and was
repeated till he had drunk it six or seven months.

13. I commonly purged him once in three weeks, or a month, with Pil. Lunares,
which I repeated six or seven times; also the specific which I gave him him
was Crato's Antepileptick powder, which he constantly took for a month,
afterward our magistral Antepileptick powder, which he took for a month longer

14. Lastly, to the completing and perfecting of the Cure, he took this
following specific, a Medicament of wonderful virtues: Take Musk, two drams:
Ambergrise, salt of man's skull, Powder of male peony-roots and seeds, of each
one dram: mix them, he took it for four months constantly.

15. By the assiduous use of which, for so long time, he became perfectly
Cured, so as that he never had any more fits. Here is to be Noted also, that
the back bone was also anointed twice a day, with the former Balsam for the
Head.

XII. An Epilepsy which was Cured only with a Sternutatory.

1. A young man of twenty years of Age, was seized with the Falling Sickness,
the fits came sometimes once a week, sometimes once in two or three days,
sometimes every day.

2. This person had been troubled with this Disease for several years, nor in
the twenty sixth year of his age was he freed from it, many Physicians had him
in-hand; and almost all methods were tried, as derivation, Revulsion,
Medicaments internal and external; Vomits, Purges, Clysters, Blysters,
Application of the Seton, Issues, Gargarisms, Errhines, Sternutatories: long
and continued Diets, with variety of specificks, but all these things were done
vain; and after a long use of every thing that was thought to be proper, the
sick was given over as Incurable.

3. And thus continued almost two years, afterward without taking any Physic,
wherein he had fits almost every day, but at the Change full and quarters of
the Moon he never failed of them, and could always predict them himself, almost
to an hour.

4. Last of all, he met with a man Reputed an Emperick, who told him, he would
certainly Cure him, provided he would follow his Counsel, and that with three
or four doses of Physic at most, the thing that was Exhibited, was a powder, a
sternutatory, and indeed it was that of Deckers, whose principal Ingrodient is
Turphethum Minerale, the composition of which you have in our Pharmacopaeia,
lib. 4. cap. 21.

5. A little of this was blown up each Nostril, but in somewhat a larger
proportion, than what the Author limits, when it was reiterated four times with
fit Intervails, the success was admirable, but the Operation very troublesome
and dangerous, and the whole Head, Face, Neck, Throat and Tongue, was swelled
mightily so that the Patient could not speak.

6. But he avoided by the Mouth and Nostrils, such a lage quantity of filthy
Corrupt Pus or matter, that I should scarcely have believed it, at the report
of another, had not mine Eyes seen it, it could not be Judged to be less then
three quarts.

7. Where, or in what place, this Corruption could be lodged is the question,
it is certain the Head could not hold it all, but without doubt the Violence of
the Medicament, made an Attraction from all parts; and cleared his Breast and
Lungs, as well as his Head.

8. For he had a long time a mighty Obstructions of the Lungs, with a
difficulty of breathing, and a disaffected Spleen, which, by virtue of the
Operation of this single Medicament, was Cured, together with his Epilepsy.

9. For after the fourth dose of this Medicament, as the Emperick had before
predicted, he had no more Epileptick fits, and so it fell out in this patient.
For he was freed from all his Diseases at once.

10. I remember it is the opinion of some Physicians, that a violent Fever
coming upon an Epilepsy commonly Cures it, the matter causing the Disease,
being by the vehement heat of the Fever either dissolved or dissipated, and I
am apt to believe, that the operation of this Medicament was not much unlike.

11. For besides the Actual drawing forth of the large quantity of that
Corrupted matter there was a mighty Inflammation of the whole Head; the whole
Head and parts Adjacent being so Inflamed, that one could not lay ones hand
long upon them with pleasure; this mighty Inflammation by degrees vanished, as
the matter evacated, by means of which, as aforesaid, the Patient was Cured.

XIII. An Epilepsy, with a great pain of the Spleen, and disaffection to the
Joints, by some, supposed to be the Gout.

1. This man aged about forty years, had been for a long time troubled with a
great Pain and Obstruction of the Spleen: with vehement pains in his extreme
parts, chiefly the Joints, both of Hands and Feet, of which he had lain ill
several weeks together.

2. He was much given to drinking, and on a certain time playing the good
Fellow, having, as it was supposed, drunk too much; fell into certain kind of
fits, which the bystanders knew not what to make of, he was taken with the
first sitting between two, so that he could not well fall, but the foaming of
the Mouth, gave evident demonstration of the nature and quality of the Disease.

3. In the Interval of one of the fits, I was sent for, to discourse the
Gentleman about his Cure; when all in a sudden as he was Earnest in discourse,
he fell down sidewayes, and as it were a little turning round, not long after
foaming at the Mouth.

4. I perceived plainly that it was the Faling sickness: and did my Endeavor
that time to Restore him to himself again.

5. I Caused to be put into his Mouth the spirit and Tincture of Castor; I also
caused his Forehead, Temples and Nostrils, to be bathed with the Powers of
Amber, which I take to be a specific in this Case, so that partly by the use
of these Medicaments, and partly by hard Frictions, etc. We restored him again.

6. After he was brought to himself, I felt upon his left Side, where I felt a
very great and hard Tumor, the like of which I was never sensible of, but once
before in a young Maid, which I did formerly Cure, the History of which will
follow in its proper place.

7. The Tumor in this our Epileptick Patient was very hard, and of a great
Magnitude, much about the bigness of a two-penny loaf; his Joints, especial in
his Hands, seemed to be Knoted, though I believe they were free from Chalk,
Stones or any such kind of hardness.

8. Probably it might only be a pituitous matter collected in those parts, not
yet indurated, I never saw him in any of his Arthritick Paroxysms; but I
ordered forthwith to be laid over all his Joints, and other places where the
pain used to Assault him Vnguentum Nostratibus, commonly called flos
Vnguentorum, by the continual application of which, all those nodes were in a
little while disolved.

9. Also upon the Region of the Spleen, I applied Mynsicht his Emplastrum de
Galbano Crocatum, which went not without its effects; but before the
Application of this Plaster; I caused the said Region of the Spleen, to be
extremely well Bathed before a Chaffingdish of Coals, with the Powers of Amber,
which was done constantly twice a day for seven days, by which he confessed he
found much relief.

10. So that by the use of these means and the inward Medicaments here after
described, this Scirrhus hardness of the Spleen: (For such a Tumor indeed it
was) became perfectly Resolved.

11. Thus much for Topics Relating to the Arthritis and the Splanchnick
affection, we come now to Internals, the first thing I prescribed, was a proper
Diet, which was made thus:

12. Take white Wine six quarts: Juniper berries bruised, so that the seeds
within may be broken, eight ounces: Gout Ivy, four ounces: male Peony roots and
seeds, of each three ounces: boil all for half an hour or more: sweeten it with
white sugar, strain it, and let the sick take it as their constant Drink.

13. But this is to be noted, That for poor people, you may use Spring water
instead of white wine; no man can tell the virtues of Juniper Berries, in
resolving any hard Tumor, in the Liver or Spleen, I have done things beyond
belief, only with a simply Decoction of the said Berries; In such like
disaffections of the said Visera: but though the Virtue and Powers thereof be
very great, it performs nothing unless it be long used; and taken as a constant
Drink.

14. For all Scirrhous, Oedimatosous, and Cancerous Tumors, are always
rebellious, and are never Mastered but by a constant and unwearied use of the
means for a very long time, yet notwithstanding the contumaciousness of these
disaffections, my Experience has confirmed to me, no more Excellent a thing,
than a strong Decoction of Juniper Berries in wine or water, as aforesaid, to
be long taken.

15. The Maid above mentioned, which I have cured of a Scrrhous of the Spleen,
Drunk the said Decoction for no less time than a whole year together.

16. But this by the way; to return to this our sick Patient, finding in him an
Complication of Diseases, I was forced to Use a Complication of remedies.

17. And finding that his Stomach was out of order, so that he could not well
digest his Food, nor did ever scarce Eat with an Appetite; I immediately caused
this following Clyster to be exhibited: Take Mutton broth, twelve ounces:
Cambogia dissolved therein, one dram: Tincture of Colocynthis, one ounce: Oil
of Roses, four ounces: Honey, three sponfulls: mix them, to be exhibited warm;
this was given over night.

18. The next morning I gave him two drams of my Catharticum Argenteum mixed
with a little broth, which wrought exceeding well, and both upwards and
downwards.

19. The fourth day following, I repeated the same dose again: and with very
admirable success.

20. The eighth day after, I exhibited this following Cathartick: Take Pil. ex
duobus, one scruple: Turpethum Minerale, four grains: Elaterium, two grains:
Oil of Lavender, two drops: mix, and make four pills for one dose: they wrought
excellently, and evacuated the morbifick matter to a wonder.

21. I reiterated this purging dose commonly once in eight or ten days; with
which Intervals of time he continued the use thereof for about four months.

22. In the Intermediate days of purging, I caused the following things in
order to be exhibited: Take our Electuarium ad Tabidos, two ounces: native
Cinnabar, powder of male-peony-roots, and seeds of Misletoe of the Oak, man's
skull, of each two drams: mix, and with syrup of Alkermes, or juice of male
Peony flowers; make an Electuary: Dose every morning fasting, the quantity of a
large Nutmeg.

23. An hour before Dinner, I ordered forty or fifty drops of the Elixir
Proprietatis, made with the Antepileptick Spirit of Vitriol to be given in a
little glass of Pope Adrians Wine.

24. Lastly, at night going to bed, our Magistral Antepileptick powder was
constantly taken in a spoonful or two of the syrup of the juice of Male peony
flowers.

25. Moreover during this whole Cure, all the Sutures of the Skull, Forehead,
Temples, Nostrils, Vertebrae of the Neck, Spina Dorsi, even to the Os Coccygis,
were bathed twice a day with the Powers of Amber and Lavender alternatively
used first one, then another.

26. By the use of these Remedies, according to the former Directions; this our
wretched Patient was restored perfectly to Health, and made so absolutely well,
as if he had never been troubled with any Disease, notwithstanding his Diseases
were so complicated and rebellious.

XIV. An Epileptick afflicted with the Obstruction of Urine, which proved
Mortal.

1. A young Man about twenty six years of Age, having been for eighteen month
very much afflicted with the Falling Sickness; assaulted with its Paroxysms
almost every day; at length was taken with an Obstruction of the Urine, whereby
he could make no Water.

2. Great endeavors had been used for the Cure of his fits, but nothing
prevailed, and afterward when the stoppage of Urine came upon him, nothing was
left unattempted in order to his delivery therefrom; there were exhibited
proper Inciders, Openers, Specific Nephreticks, and such things as might not
only prepare and fit the Body for a Diuretic Evacuation, but they were also
given with Oleaginous bodies, things naturally to be exhibited in a Nephritis,
that as well as the passages might be opened, they may be made smooth and
slippery.

3. Ten days passed over, wherein not so much as one drop of Water was made;
notwithstanding the Catheter was made use of, so that now all hopes of Life was
dispaired off.

4. Upon the eleventh day after this stoppage of Urine, the Sick was taken with
the last of his Epileptick fits, in which he dyed.

5. It Is wonderful to be observed, that after his Death, a flood of Water came
out of his Mouth, near to the quantity of two gallons, clear and a little
viscous.

6. Afterward the Body was opened, and the substance of the Brain on the left
Side was found resolved into a kind of Mucilage; in the Cavities a great
quantity of humor was found, not much unlike thick Milk, his Liver and Spleen
were sound and firm; the Cystus of the Gall, not differing from those in
perfect Health.

7. But that which was most admirable to behold, was, that in the superficies
of the Lungs there was a great many Bladders full of Water; some as large as
English Currants, some as big as Hazle-nuts, and some bigger; and one great
Bladder, which probably might hold two or three pints or more (and not much
unlike the Bladder of the Urine) which was found almost empty, with two or
three spoonfuls of Water in it, the Reinal passages being wholly stopped up with
a matter resembling a soft kind of Clay.

8. This without doubt, was the true reason that the Course of the Serum was
converted to the Lungs, where Nature formed a Receptacle, much resembling the
Urinal Bladder, and out of which, without all doubt, Issued that vast quantity
of Water, presently after the expiration of the Sick.

9. And this I am more induced to believe, because that during the whole time
of this stoppage of Urine, and some Weeks before, when it came away in a very
small quantity, he never complained of any pain in those parts, except only a
kind of heaviness.

XV. A simple Epilepsy in a Girl of nine years of Age.

1. She was bred up under careful Parents, so that there was an equality and
moderation, both as to her Eating and Drinking, and Exercise; whereby it could
not be supposed, that there could be any great production of evil humors, from
the Irregularity of the six Non-naturals.

2. As she was dear to her Parents, and their only Child, so they spared for no
Cost, in order to her Recovery, a Consultation of six or seven Physicians was
immediately held, in whose discourse her Father told me, there was no
Congruity, quot homines, tot capita, quot mentes, tot sententiae, every Man was
of a different opinion.

3. So that her Father being a Wise man, having sometimes studied Physic
himself, forthwith relinquisht them all; he hearing of me, came to me, and gave
me a Relation how his Child was affected, how tenderly and carefully he had
brought her up, what Consultations of Physicians he had, under various
opinions, and how Heterogene, in his opinion, they were to Truth; and therefore
desired my thoughts thereof.

4. I asked him, if she had any forewarning of the coming of the Fit? he told
me no, and that she never had the least apprehension thereof, till it was upon
her, from whence I concluded this Disease to be Idiopathetick, or essentially
in the Brain.

5. From her careful bringing up, I concluded there could be no Cacochymick
habit of Body, but rather a simple dis-affection of the Brain.

6. He asked my opinion, if I thought, Purging, Vomiting, or Bleeding might be
good for her, to which I made answer, That as from the Antecedent signs, I
could perceive no fullness of humors, but rather that she was of a spare body,
so I held that evacuations of that kind would be prejudicial to her, and
diminish her native heat, radical humidity and vital strength, which we ought
to preserve.

7. To which opinion her Father immediately conceeded, and that he was always
against any of those kind of evacuations, because of her thinness of Body, yet
she would Eat and Drink with a good Stomach, would digest well, and walk in the
strength thereof, he desired my further thoughts concerning the Cure of his
Child.

8. I told him, as I did believe, it proceeded from a dis-affection of the
Brain, that the true method of Cure, whether external or internal must be
derived from that principal Indication of altering, comforting and strengthening
of the part afflicted, which if it could be happily accomplished, I doubted not
but his Child would suddenly acquire its pristin Health.

9. As to the Cure, my Judgment was, that she should not so much use drying
things, as Cephalicks, or Neuroticks, which might restore the Head, Brain and
original of the Nerves.

10. And for which purpose, I commended to him, this following Neurotick Wine:
Take choice Canary, six quarts: Rosemary and Lavender-flowers, tops of red Sage
and sweet Marjoram, Garden Thyme, Musked Cranes-bill, Misleto of the Oak, Male
peony roots seeds and flowers, of each six ounces: Nutmegs bruised, one ounce
and half: Zedoary, Gentian, contra yerva, Virginia snake-root, of each one
ounce: Cloves bruised, two drams: Volatile salt of Man's Skull, half an ounce:
choice Musk in fine powder, Volatile salt of Hartshorn and Amber, of each two
drams: Ambergrise in fine powder, one dram: mix all together, digest in a warm
place, and after ten or twelve days, let her drink of the clear, three ounces
in a Morning fasting, three ounces an hour before Dinner, and as much at night
going to bed.

11. This I ordered to be continued for about ten or twelve days, after which
time she should take it twelve days more, twice a day, to wit, Morning and
Night, and after that every Morning fasting only, for about two months together.

12. Outwardly, I ordered him to Bath her Head with the Powers of Rosemary,
twice a day for two or three Weeks more or less; her Head being first shaved,
and then to apply over the same, the Antepileptick Plaster of Franciscus
Valesius.

13. The Gentleman highly approved of my Council, followed my Directions, and
in less than three mouths time his Child became perfectly well, for which he
not only gave me his acknowledgments, but a very grateful reward.

XVI. An Epilepsy, in an old Woman, which degenerated into a Palsy.

1. This Woman being more than sixty years of Age, of a fat and gross-body,
swarthy Complexion; robust or strong for her years, was taken with the
Falling Sickness.

2. She had been under the Hands of many Physicians, by whom she had passed
almost thorough all Methods, endeavoring the Cure of her Distemper; in so
much, that what with Diets, Blisterings, Cuppings, Issues, application of the
Seton, Errhines, Sternutatories, Apophlegmatisms, Vomits, Purges, and
Specificks; often repeated and long taken, scarcely any thing else could be
thought upon for a Cure.

3. After all which, she applied her self to me; to whom I delivered my
opinion, that I much feared, by reason of her great Age, that she sought after
what she would never find, and therefore desired her to desist any further
thoughts thereof.

4. Only I told her, that to comfort and cherish her, she might constantly take
some proper Antepileptick Wine; however being wearied with her, I was forced at
last to attempt something; and that which I did, was neither more or less, but
that application of Vesicatories to the Soles of her Feet, which were
reiterated three or four several times; by means whereof her Epilepsy totally
left her, so that to her Dying day, she never had any more Fits.

5. But she was forthwith taken with a Palsy on both sides; so that she could
not make her self ready nor unready, nor Feed her self, or be helpful in any
kind.

6. This Palsy was without pain, only with a little numbness, joined with a
trembling and weakness of the parts; it continued upon her to her dying-day,
nor by the greatest help of Art could she meet with any the least benefit, much
less a Cure.

7. In this person the Morbifick matter first afflicted the Brain, whence came
the Epilepsy, but by a translation of the said matter, to the Original of the
Nerves, and thereby to their various Branchings, the Disease was changed from a
Falling Sickness to a Palsy.

8. This Woman after that the Epileptick Fits had left her, and the Palsy had
siezed her, by I know not whose advice, began to take Opiates, which she
continued the use of for some years, and as she conceived with a manifold
advantage to her self.

9. She always said, she found her self better after the taking of the Opiate
than before, and conceived it added very much strength to her; for that after
she had been used to it a while, if she pretermitted for one night the taking
thereof, she should be the next day sick, heavy, and unpleasant, and
stomachless as to her Food.

10. After the taking of the Opiate for a year or somewhat better, she came to
a good use of one of her Hands, and she could also a little use the other,
which benefit, no body could beat her out of, but that she received it from the
assiduous taking of the Opiate.

11. And did verily believe, that had not her great Age been an obstacle in the
way, that very Medicament alone would have restored her to her perfect Health;
such was her opinion, and for any thing that I know, there might be somewhat of
Truth in it.

12. But however, the consideration of this Observation, makes me believe, that
there is yet a greater excellency and virtue in Opiates, than the World is awar
of; and I doubt not but some experiments of this kind might more confirm this
Judgment.

13. I remember Roger Dickson, a Chyrurgian in Thames Street told me, that he
had once a Paralytick Patient, to whom he gave upon occasion a Dose of an
Opiate for rests sake, after which, his Patient would never let him rest,
without some few doses of it by her; which she took for six or eight months
together, and thereby became Cured of a Palsy, which had afflicted her many
years.

XVII. The Falling Sickness in a middle aged Woman, proceeding from Melancholy.

1. A Gentlewoman about forty years of Age, having had for a long time a great
deal of discontent upon her Spirit, was extremely troubled with Melancholy; and
to that degree afflicted with this pernicious humor, that she has confessed
that she had many times tempted to make away her self; but the Cause or Reason
of this trouble she would never reveal to any one.

2. Some thought it to be unlawful Love, and some thought it to be Discontent;
others, some private grudge between her and her Husband; but those that had
been her associates and familiar acquaintances for many years, knew the
contrary; but guessed it to be from other things.

3. Some thought it to be a discontented Mind, because she could not attain
that Glory, Pleasure, Fortune and such like in the World, as her equals had
arrived to, or that her ambitious Spirit might aspire after, although she then
lived happily, genteely, and free from any care, trouble, or turmoil.

4. But what ever the true original of her Melancholy was, I could never learn,
nor hear her confess: this Melancholy discontented Condition so far increased
upon her, as to render her very unhappy in her person, made her very thin and
lean, brought upon her great weakness; so that sometimes she would Faint or
Swoon away.

5. Afterward, as the evil increased, these fits degenerated, and from
Fainting and Swooning Fits, she became affected with other Fits, not much
unlike the Mother.

6. After these had afflicted her, for about four or five months, they still
augmenting their force, became at length Epileptical, in so much that when or
wheresoever they siezed her, she fell down with a great Crying out, and a
froath and foaming at the Mouth.

7. She had been under a Knights hands, reputed a great Physician; by whose
advice and directions, her Husband said, he had spent two hundred pounds, but
without the least amendment, he rather thought she grew worse and worse.

8. When I understood what was done, I partly conceived the cause of the
miscarriage, for whatsoever Antepileptick Specificks he might give her, he gave
her nothing which might repress these Hypochondriack disaffections and
distempers of the Womb.

9. Moreover her Courses had been preternaturally stopped for about two years
together; during all which time, she had a very large flux of the Whites, which
was a great trouble and weakening to her.

10. I began in the first place to give her things that might evacuate the
Melancholy humor; among which was an Infusion of Rhubarb and Sena in white
Wine, with black Myrobalans and a small proportion of Castoreum; with this I
gently purged her for many days together.

11. In the next place, I provided an Injection for the Womb, which was thus
made: Take Plantan water, three quarts: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, six
ounces: spirit of Wine, eight ounces: fine Aloes in powder, half an ounce, or
something more: Roch Alum, Salt of Vitriol, of each three drams: Saccharum
Saturni, two drams: juice of Liquorice, one dram: sal prunellae, six drams:
mix, dissolve, decant the clear from the faeces; filter it through brown Paper,
and keep it for use.

12. With this I caused the Womb to be Syringed three or four times a day, and
sometimes oftener; by the use of which Medicine, and the internal means
aforementioned, I perfectly removed and cured her of this great flux of the
Whites, at which the Woman was very much pleased, and became much more cheerful
than before.

13. And because through the oppression of the Melancholy humor, her Spirits
had been much cast down, I caused her to take the following things. Take juice
of Alkermes, six ounces: choice Canary, eight ounces: blood red Tincture of
Castoreum, five ounces: spirit of Hartshorn, two ounces: Salt of Man's Skull,
three drams: white sugar candy in fine powder, half a pound: mix all well
together dissolve it over a gentle fire, and keep it for use.

14. Of this she took two large spoonfuls every Morning fasting; drinking
immediately after the same, about an ounce or somewhat more of the best
Angelica Water, by the constant use of this Medicament she confessed her self
to be so much cheared and revived, so that she was in great hopes she should
once again be well.

15. Now although these Medicines had not done much as to the Epilepsy; for
indeed they were not levelled against it, yet they had much abated the
vehemence of her fits; and also had altered the times of their coming, so that
whereas she had used to have them sometimes two or three times a Week, or
oftener, she had them not now, once a Week, and sometimes but once a fortnight.

16. So that I apparently saw, that we had got ground upon the Disease; and
therefore I advised her still to continue the same in the Morning, as hitherto
she had done; and at Noon to take this following Medicament:

17. Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, one dram and half: Man's Skull prepared,
Misleto of the Oak, powder of Male peony roots, of each a scruple: mix for a
Bolus to be given an hour and half before Dinner.

18. Lastly, at Night going to Bed, I caused her to take of this following
Electuary: Take choice Musk, one dram: Ambergrise, salt of Man's Skull, of each
half a dram: salt of Vipers, of Hartshorn, and of Amber, choice Civet, of each
one scruple; those things being reduced into Powder which ought to be, make
them into a Bolus, with a sufficient quantity of Venice Treacle, of this she
took one dram every Night going to Bed.

19. For her ordinary Drink, a Decoction of Guajacum, Sarsa, Sarsafras, Lignum
Rhodium, Rosemary and Lavender flowers, Misleto of the Oak, Male peony roots
and seeds, with Coriander seed, all in equal proportion, to be boiled in a
sufficient quantity of fair Water, then strain it and sweeten it with white
sugar; wrought up with a little Yest, and so bottled up.

20. This was her constant Drink she took, during the whole Cure, so that what
with the use of this Diet and the former Medicaments, together with Bathing all
the Head, Temples, Vertebrae of the Neck and Backbone, the Stomach, the Region
of the Spleen and Abdomen, with the Powers of Amber, this our Patient was
through the Mercies of God, in about eight months time perfectly restored to
Health, although this Complication of Diseases had afflicted her for many years
together.

XVIII. An Epilepsy in an elderly Matron.

1. This Woman being about forty years of Age, was siezed with the
Falling Sickness as was thought from an Accident, which was the peril of
Drowning.

2. At first it only afflicted her once a Week, but the Disease getting
strength, constantly afflicted her every day, insomuch that she would have
sometimes two or three fits a day.

3. As it came from a fright, so I conceived the Disease Central in the Brain;
and therefore applied my self to these Indications of Cure, which might rectify
the Distemper thereof.

4. I caused her to smell to the Spirit of Sal Armoniack, from which she
received very great advantage; every two hours, I caused her to take two or
three spoonfuls of this following Julep: Take Aqua Caelestis, commonly called
Aqua Vitae Matthioli, Aqua Angelicae magis Composita, choice Cinnamon water, of
each six ounces: choice Canary, ten ounces: spirit of sal Armoniack, so much as
may make it pretty sharp.

5. At Night going to bed, I ordered her to take the Electuary of Musk,
mentioned in the former Cure; taking after the same an ounce or somewhat more
of Cinnamon Water.

6, Her Hair I caused to be shaved off; I caused her whole Head to be bathed,
twice a day, with this following Compositum: Take Powers of Rosemary, of Amber,
and of Sassafras, of each two ounces: Powers of Oranges and Limons, of each one
ounce: Powers of Lavender and Sage, of each half an ounce: Musk in fine powder,
half a dram: Ambergrise in powder, ten grains: mix all together, which keep in
a Glass close stopped for four or five days; then make use thereof as aforesaid
in bathing of the Head.

7. After Bathing; apply over the whole, the Specific Antepileptick Plaster of
Franciscus Valesius; by the use of these things in a little time, we had the
hopes of Cure.

8. And one thing let me here observe to the Reader, concerning the Virtue of
Musk, Ambergrise, and the like Odoriferous things, that they have a specific
Influence upon the Brain, above all other things in Nature; and comfort its
Functions and Faculties, beyond what I am able to express in Words; the which I
have proved in manifold Diseases of the Head, to my great wonder and almost
amazement.

9. But in the use of these Perfumes, a small Dose performs nothing; one may be
bold to give twelve or fourteen grains of Musk, and as much of Ambergrise and
Civet, as may increase the Dose to a scruple, though in this Case, where they
are simply used, it may not often be necessary to give a Dose above once in two
days, but I must confess I have given such a Dose twice a day.

10. A young Woman about twenty three years of Age, was also accidently taken
with the Falling Sickness, by means of a Fright, whom I Cured in few Weeks
time, by the method of the Observation, now recited with very little difference.

11. She had not above three or four fits before application was made to me,
nor she had but two after she began to take of the abovementioned Medicaments,
and she was perfectly well in about a months time.

XIX. An Epilepsy in a little Youth, who was afflicted with a scald Head.

1. This Youth was about eight years of Age, and was at once afflicted with a
scald Head, and the Falling Sickness; two evil Distempers met in one person.

2. I caused his Hair to be clipped off with Scissers, not shaved with a Razor,
to which I applied, the Cataplasmum ad Porriginem, which was applied duly
according to the Directions which I have given in my Doron Medicum, lib. 3.
cap. 7. sect. 1. whereby, I perfectly cleared it from the said Scald.

3. But this being not all the Work which was to be done; there being a great
humidity lodged in the Brain and Ventricles thereof, I applied a Vesicatory
over the whole Head, which after healing, I repeated three times, whereby
without giving any Physic inwardly, the Epileptick fits were much changed and
abated in their Vigor.

4. However I thought it necessary gently to Purge the Youth, the which I did
with Pilulae Lunares, repeated once a Week for six or seven Weeks together.

5. His Drink was a small Decoction of Guajacum and Sarsa.

6. In the Intervals of purging, I sometimes gave him my Magistral
Antepileptick powder; sometimes the musked Electuary, mentioned in some of
these Epileptick Observations, and sometimes I gave him Crato's Antepileptick
powder, which were of good use, yet they took not totally away the fits.

7. Upon the advice, which I received from another Physician, to try a few
Doses of Laudanum, I made an attempt with one grain and half; afterward
continuing the exhibition thereof for six or seven days, I increased the dose
to two grains; and to two grains and half, by the use of which thing the fits
absolutely ceased.

8. I was the more willing to make Trial thereof, because of the worth and
experience of my Friend, who told me, that he had many times proved it in a
Falling Sickness with great success, and that for the most part, he found it do
the Cure when all other things failed.

9. Upon this assurance, I made this Trial, and found it in all Cases to answer
the Character he gave of it, and my Expectations; in about ten or twelve times
taking thereof, the Youth was freed from his Epilepsy, nor had he it ever any
more.

XX. An Epilepsy in a Consumptive person.

1. Whether the Epilepsy was the cause of the Consumption, or the Consumption
the cause of the Epilepsy, I will not determine; because their beginnings were
so nearly together.

2. This our Patient was about twenty four years of Age; a young man formerly
fleshy, and of a good strong habit of Body to appearance, before this Disease
siezed him, though now become exceeding thin and lean; at the first coming of
the fits, they afflicted him but seldom, as once every change, and full of the
Moon.

3. But afterward growing stronger upon him, they came every quarter of the
Moon, and now at the time of undertaking of this Cure, sometimes once or twice
a day.

4. 'Twas an Epilepsy arising from the extreme parts; for he could feel it
coming upon him in his Fingers and Toes, a considerable time before it took
away his Senses, so that he could tell the bystanders that the fit was coming,
and also provided a place to fall down in.

5. This Disease he told me, crept so sensibly upon him, and he could as easily
discern it creeping up both his Legs and his Arm, as if he had thrusted them
down gradually into cold water.

6. During this affliction; as there was a pining of his whole Body, so he had
a very weak Stomach, seldom desiring to Eat, nor well digesting when he had
Eaten. For this purpose, I gave him the following Emetick: Take Crocus
Metallorum, six drams: Salt of Vitriol, two scruples: mix and give it in a
little Broth; this wrought very well with him, and gave him about eight Vomits
and five Stools.

7. The fifth day following, I gave him a dram and half of my Catharticum
Argenteum, which wrought excellently both upwards and downwards.

8. This done, I caused him to take in all his Drink, six or eight drops more
or less of the Antepileptick Spirit of Vitriol, or so much at least, as might
make this Liquor so sharp as he could conveniently drink it; and this I ordered
him to continue the use of for some certain time; whereby his Stomach was
comforted and strengthened, and he began to eat his Food in good order.

9. Morning and Evening, I ordered him to take of this following Electuary:
Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, four ounces: Misleto of the Oak in powder, powder
of Male-peony roots and seeds, Man's Skull levigated, of each six drams: native
Cinnabar, Pea-cocks dung, powder of the Liver of Frogs dried, of each four
drams: Musk in fine powder, one dram and half: Ambergrise in fine powder, half
a dram: Civet, half a scruple: mix all together, and with syrup of the juice of
Male-peony flowers, make an Electuary according to Art.

10. Of this he took the quantity of a Chestnut every Morning fasting, and
every Night going to bed, which was continued for near a quarter of a year
together.

11. Outwardly, his Stomach, Hypochonders and Backbone, from the Vertebrae of
the Neck, down to the Os Coccygis was anointed with this following Balsam: Take
Oil of Nutmegs by expression, four ounces: Oil of Amber, Oil of Rosemary, Oils
of Rue, of Sage, and sweet Marjoram, all Chimical, of each half an ounce: mix
them well together, and anoint, as aforesaid.

12. His Head was shaved, and bathed all over with the Powers of Amber, Morning
and Night, over which was put this following Emplaster: Take Rosin, per Rosin,
Venice Turpentine, of each four ounces: Oil of nutmegs by expression, three
ounces: sheeps Suet, ship Pitch, of each one ounce: Oil of Amber, two ounces
and half: Wax, a sufficient quantity; melt, mix and make an Emplaster, which
apply over the whole Head, after bathing, as aforesaid.

13. By the constant use of these Medicaments, our Patient in the space of ten
Weeks was perfectly Cured; but he continued the use of the Medicines for some
time after.

Observations from other AVTHORS.
XXI. A Falling Sickness in a Child.

1. A Boy three years old, had a fit of the Falling Sickness, from which he was
freed with the Smoke of Tobacco.

2. It was done by a Servant drawing it out of a Pipe, and blowing it into the
Mouth of the Boy being open; the Child fell a Vomiting, and the fit ceased.
Riverius, Cent. 2. Observe. 160.

XXII. The Falling Sickness in a young Maiden.

1. I have often experienced, and can testify the same by many Witnesses, that
Peony gathered under its proper Constellation, viz. when the Moon is descendant
in the sign Aries, does remove the Falling Sickness only by external
application.

2. And I caused a certain Virgin of eighteen years of Age, who had been
troubled with this Disease from her Childhood, and daily fits, being in the
Hospital, to wear it about her Neck and Arms; after which she was perfectly
cured.

3. Hence it is apparent, of what consequence Astrology is in the practice of
Physic. Riverius, Cent. 4. Observe. 387.

XXIII. The Falling Sickness accompanied with a Dead Palsy.

1. A Girl named Katherine Bognole, ten years old, of a phlegmatic
Constitution, broad well-set Body, was afflicted five or six Months with the
Falling Sickness, by fits almost every day, yea sometimes twice or thrice in a
day, which was attended with a privation of motion and sense in her right Arm.

2. This Girl being brought into our Hospital in the month of December, 1643.
in the first place, I prescribed her a potion purging phlegm, with a Cephalic
Decoction, which after some days was repeated, and she used between whiles
Preparatives, and specific Medicaments, but without success.

3. At length I gave her about two drams of Montagnana his Opiate, four or five
days together, which being over, she began to move her Fingers, and soon after
her whole Arm; she was not so frequently taken with Fits of the
Falling Sickness afterward.

4. So that within twenty days (taking every Morning of the foresaid Opiate)
she was perfectly cured of both Diseases.

5. The Opiate was made as follows: Take Roots of Male-peony, Staechas,
Costus, of each ten drams: Agarick, five ounces: Pellitory of Spain,
Carraway-seeds, Anniseed, Assa faetida, and Aristolochia Rotunda, of each two
drams and a half: juice of Squils and choice Honey, of each one pound and two
ounces: let the juice of squils and Honey boil together over a gentle fire,
unto a good consistence, then add the Pouders and make then all into an
Electuary. Let the Dose be two drams every Morning, three hours before Meat.
Riverius, Cent. 4. Obs. 395.

XXIV. A Falling Sickness proceeding from the Mother.

1. The Wife of Mr. Polemarchus de Sumenes, was diverse years together vexed
with many Symtoms of the Mother, which had a resemblance of the
Falling Sickness.

2. She tried many Medicines prescribed by able Physicians, but all in vain.

3. At last by advice of a Woman, she took the flesh of a Wolf brought into
Powder, wearing a piece of the same flesh salted continually about her; after
which she was perpetually freed from the said Symptoms. Riverius, Cent. 4.
Observe. 502.

XXV. Of the Falling Sickness by sympathy with the Stomach.

1. As from the knowledge of the Fact, Lawyers understand what is Law and Right
in the Case, so from the knowledge of the Disease, we must understand the way
of Cure.

2. I was told of a kind of Fainting, expressed by uncertain signs common to
other Diseases, which by Intimation I Judge to be much like a Syncope or
Swooning.

3. But you affirm, by undoubted signs, that the Disease is the Falling
sickness, not properly arising from the Brain, but by sympathy with the
Stomach, and that it has its certain times of egress, which commonly happens in
the wain of the Moon.

4. Matters going thus, the Cure must be thus undertaken: six or seven days
before the coming of her fit, give her a Clyster, which besides other things
that are convenient, must have in it half an ounce of Hiera picra, and half an
ounce of Diaphoenicon.

5. Let her feed very sparingly the same day on a thin Diet; prepare the humor
to be purged with Oxymel simple or compound.

6. Purge her the day after, with the Infusion of Rhubarb and Agarick, of each
one dram: in which two drams of Hiera Diacolocynthidos must be mixed.

7. But if that Medicine be not to be had, dissolve therein Hiera simple and
Diaphoenicon, of each one dram and a half; when you consider the strength of
your Patient and the greatness of the Disease, you may better determine of the
quantity of the Medicaments.

8. The third day, let her forbear all evacuations and other Medicaments,
unless you may think it fit to give her a dram of the best Mithridate.

9. On the fourth day give her a Vomit, which is a proper and efficacious
Remedy in these Diseases, the humors having stuck fast in the Stomach, and
other adjacent parts.

10. Now, that is likely to be most effectual, which is made of two scruples,
or one dram of Asarum roots, dissolved in Hydromel, or a Decoction of Raisons,
with a little Cinnamon and Syrup of Violets.

11. The following days till the time of the fit be over, give her every
Morning four scruples of this Opiate: Take Conserves of Rosemary and Betony
flowers, of each one ounce: old Mithridate, two drams and a half: Venice
Treacle, four scruples: Misleto of the Oak, Peony-seed, Man's Skull poudred, of
each two scruples: mix them, let her take it by it self, or in Betony-water.

12. If you can get Male-peony, there is nothing better, either the Seed or the
Root gathered in the Wain of the Moon; one dram in weight. These must be used
three or four times near the time of the fit. Ex Consiliis Fernelij.

XXVI. A Falling Sickness in a Boy of eight years old, with the loss almost
both of Reason and Memory.

1. Take leaves of Rosemary, Betony, Marjoram, Staechas, Sage, of each one
handful: of the Cordial-flowers, of each a pugil: boil all in two pints of
Water, in the strained Liquor steep all night Epithymum, two drams: Sena, four
ounces: Ginger, two drams: choice Cinnamon, four drams, in the Morning: boil
them a little and press out the liquor, wherein dissolve of the best Honey, and
whitest Sugar, of each half a pound: make all into a syrup indifferently
boiled, that is to an indifferent height; let him take of it once in a Week,
one ounce and an half; with Decoction of Betony.

2. Item, Take Conserve of Bugloss and Rosemary-flowers, of each one ounce: the
best Mithridate and Treacle, of each half a dram: Seeds and Roots of
Male-peony, Misleto of the Oak, Man's Skull, Hartshorn poudred, of each two
drams: mix all into an Electuary with a sufficient quantity of syrup of
Violets; let him take one dram or four scruples, three or four Mornings
together after Purgation, three or four hours at least before Dinner.

3. Let him drink no Wine at all: let his drink be simple water, in which
Hartshorn was boiled with a little Ginger.

4. Let him abstain from Fruits, especially such as will not keep, from Milk
and whatsoever is made of it, from Beans, Pease and Fishes. Ex Consiliis
Fernelij.

XXVII. The Falling Sickness with many other Symptoms.

1. This most deplorable Disease of the Falling Sickness proceeding from a
strong inveterate Cause in an impure and ill habited Body, will hardly admit of
any Cure; the Patient is so weak, that no part (the Lungs excepted) is freed
from great disorder.

2. His Head is afflicted with Pain, Swiming, Melancholy and the
Falling-si^kness, his Bowels are exceedingly impure, by means whereof the Body
is infected, his Urine thick and gravelly, which argues an obstruction and
heaviness in his Kidneys; nor is the old pain in his Thigh as yet removed.

3. In so great a Concatenation of Diseases, the Cure must be begun with
Purging; and because it can scarcely with safety be performed by Purgatives, we
must attempt the doing it rather by a think drying Diet with Guajacum.

4. Let him then be purged first either with the Syrup formerly prescribed, or
by a Medicine of the Infusion of Rhubarb and Agarick, with two drams of
Diaphoenicon.

5. The second or third day after, let him begin his thin Diet, but let him
feed sparingly on Roast Meats, and let him drink a simple Decoction of Guajacum
Wood without the Bark, that he may the better inure himself to it.

6. Let him Sup at seven in the Evening, and let him drink at five or six in
the Morning, and again at four in the Afternoon a Cup of strong and pure
Decoction made of the Wood and Bark of Guajacum and of Polypody with Sage,
Betony and Stoechas, and in the first days this shall be instead of a
preparatory Apozeme; do not force him to Sweat.

7. When six or seven days are past, and the humors prepared and stirred, let
him again be purged with the former, or some other fit Medicament, or to which
Sena and Epythymum are added.

8. And then let him begin to Sweat with the aforesaid Decoction, that the
inner parts of the Belly being evacuated, the upper parts consequently may be
disburthened of its Superfluities.

9. When the Sweat shall freely evacuate and cleanse his Body, so that it
becomes more extenuated and lean, it will be time then to use Topical
Medicaments.

10. Fomentations that are attenuating and dissipating must be applied to his
Thigh, which was the first Cause of all his weakness, and after the
Fomentations a Cataplasm of the crude Roots of Bryony and wild Cucumer, with
Mustard Seed, and the pulp of Figs mingled together in a convenient proportion.

11. If these things have not done enough toward the Cure, a Phaenigmus at
last must be applied of Leven and Cantharides till the roots of the Disease be
plucked up; for you shall do more by these strong attractives than with a very
long Ulcer or Issue, which only receives the Humors, but does not draw them.

12. Afterward you must also open the Haemorrhoid Veins either with the juice
of Mercury-leaves, or of Figs; or with a Suppository of Hiera simple, with the
root of round Birthwort, but so as that an emollient Fomentation be premised.

13. Or, if they cannot be opened enough, or will not run, it will be good to
open the Vena Saphena in the left Foot, and to let him Bleed as his strength
will bear.

14. While you apply these Topics to the Cure of his Thigh, you may apply
Topics to his Head, and in the first place Errhina, which may draw Snivel out
of his Brain, then use Frictions of his Head, with bags of discussing seeds,
Millet, and Salt, fried.

15. After which his Head being shorn to the Skin, lay on a Plaster of roots of
Florentine Orrice with Hermodactyles and Mustard Seed: which being poudered
must be made up with Melilot Plaster, and a sufficient quantity of Turpentine.
And afterward use a stronger, if need require.

16. And to the same purpose Cupping-glasses, sometimes without, sometimes with
Scarification, may be fastened to the hinder part of his Head, and you must
continue the use of these things, with the foresaid Diet of Guajacum till both
the inward and outward parts of the Body shall be cleansed from bad humors.

17. Setons in the hinder part of his Head, and Issues in the Coronal Suture
have not that attractive faculty, as was said before; nor can they perform (as
experience teaches;) that which the other remedies are able to do, and many
times they most sadly torment the Patients to no purpose.

18. When the body and all its parts have been thus accomodated, if yet any
suspicion of the Falling Sickness remains, those Medicaments may oppertunely be
applied, which are known by their whole substance and hidden properties to Cure
the said Disease. Ex Consiliis Fernelij.

XXVIII. An Epilepsy easily cured.

1. A Maid that had the Falling Sickness was Cured by taking Oxycratum, a
draught whereof she took every Morning, and before her Fit she drank pure
Vinegar.

2. After the Disease was cured, she was taken with pains in her Limbs, which
were removed by hot Baths. Riverius, Observe. 601.

XXIX. The Falling Sickness in a young Girl.

1. A Girl of twelve years old was frequently tormented with the
Falling Sickness, for the Cure whereof many Remedies were used but all in vain.

2. She was taken also with a Pleurisy, for which she was at diverse times let
Blood, and from that time she was never afflicted with the Falling Sickness.
Riverius, Observe. 609.

XXX. The Falling Sickness coming every day.

1. Experimented and approved by the Testimonies of many sick persons: among
whom (I shall speak of the rest elsewhere) was the Daughter of David Schon a
Joyner and Citizen of Lauginga, who being ten years old, did for the space of
three months, fall every day into Epileptick fits.

2. For toward Evening, she did suddenly fall down, being deprived of Sense
and Motion: but after a short space of time, she came to her self, and would
rise of her own accord.

3. I being desired by the Damsels Mother, undertook the Cure of this
grievious, cruel and long Disease, after this manner. Having well purged her
Head, I gave her to drink five days together in the Morning fasting, and at the
coming of her Fits three drops of the Oil of Lignum Heraclium; by the use
whereof, to the wonder of all that knew her, and the Glory of God, she was
perfectly freed from that long lasting and daily afflicting Disease, which for
these many years has never troubled her since.

4. To God alone be the Honor and Glory, who have Implanted in the said Oil an
hidden force and faculty, to Cure the Falling Sickness, Rulandus, Cent. 2.
Observe. 6.

XXXI. The Falling Sickness in a Child half a year old.

1. Experimented upon the Child of John Reschinger, Chief Register in the
Monastery of Medinga near Lauginga, being half a year old, who Night and Day
was many times vexed with grievious Epileptick fits.

2. It foamed at the Mouth, trembled, was frighted, its Eyes were drawn awry,
etc.

3. Being called, I gave it being near a fit, seven drops of the Oil of Lignum
Heraclium, by which (God be praised) the fit abated, the Infant came to its
self; and was perfectly cured, and never after troubled with the like Disease;
but from that time, many years afterward it lived well and free. Rulandus,
Cent. 3. Observe. 61.

XXXII. The Fall^ng-sickness arising from Blood.

1. Gordonius, a most expert Physician, in his Chapter of the Falling Sickness
professes, that this Disease is incurable, for he ingeniously confesses, That
he never saw any one cured in all his Life. I, as many other Authors have done,
have seen many perfectly cured by Physic.

2. A Gentlewoman of Quality, twenty four years old, strong and full of Blood,
is taken with a dangerous Epilepsy; for violently turning of her Eyes, and
fiercely writhing of her Hands, she was moved with so great and so reciprocal a
motion of her whole Body and Head, with the loss of her understanding and
senses, that you would have thought her to be possessed with Devils.

3. I address my self to the Cure, like Saint George to fight with the Dragon;
I pour Venice Treacle mixed with the sharpest Vinegar into her Mouth and
Nostrils: I prescribed sharp Clysters.

4. I bound her Thighs so hard as to cause pain, and I applied Cupping-glasses
to her Ribs: I put strong Errhines into her Nostrils. Lastly, when the seventh
fit had cruelly afflicted her for the space of twelve hours, and I feared the
Disease would turn to an Apoplexy, when the fit was over, I opened the Vena
Cephalica so called, which is in the Arm.

5. After this evacuation, the eight fit came much more gently, and she had her
Senses a little: which seeing, I let her Blood again more plentifully in the
Head Vein of the other Arm. Having used these Evacuations, and her Belly being
liberally purged by the use of biting Clysters, she recovered this so grievious
Malady. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 18.

XXXIII. A Falling Sickness cured by a Caustic.

1. I have seen a wonderful Case. A certain man had a trembling in the Thumb of
his left Hand, a long time together.

2. This ceasing (when the venomous Vapor was risen from his Thumb into his
Brain) he was frequently taken with this Disease by fits, the Physicians
devised several ways to Cure the same.

3. At last with an actual Cautery (after the manner of the Ancients) applied
to his diseased Thumb, he was cured: for there issued abundance of crude humors
from the Ulcer. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 19.

XXXIV. The Falling Sickness, cured by syrup of Tobacco.

1. Wonderful are those things which are related by Monardus, Clusius, and
others diligent Writers of Spices, concerning the admirable Virtue of Tobacco
in the curing of cold Diseases; but that is more wonderful which I have
experimented concerning its Power to Cure this Disease.

2. I have known diverse grown persons and of years, to whom I have been given
many Medicines both such as work by open; and such as operate by secret
qualities, and Issues have been made in the hind-part of the Head and round
about, and have been long kept open, and all in vain, for they have grown worse
and worse, and must certainly have dyed of these most violent Paroxysms, had
not the Malady been overcome by this invaluable remedy.

3, Now the Medicament was a Syrup made of Honey and the juice of green leaves
of Tobacco, whereof they licked; (their Bodies being first well purged) three
hours after Supper, the space of forty days, taking in that time the quantity
of three ounces, and none of these relapsed.

4. If you cannot get green Tobacco, use the dry leaves which are strongest and
soonest provoke Sneezing. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 20.

XXXV. One preserved from a cruel Epilepsy by a Vomit.

1. That Vomiting is very apt to bring Paroxysms of the Falling Sickness, the
most renowned Septalius informs us, Lib. 6. Caution. Medicar. No. 50. where he
thus Writes.

2. Take heed you do not provoke Vomit in the Epileptick fits, for I have known
some attempting to do this in the Paroxysm, led by the Authority of certain
Writers, who suddenly killed their Patients.

3. For the Head being more filled by that violent motion, and the matter being
strongly moved which was in the Head before, they caused an Obstruction, whence
an Apoplexy is wont to follow, etc:

4. This is very true in driving away the Epileptick fits. But for the
preserving of Patients from the Fits, the antecedent matter being voided which
would Cause the future Paroxysm; that a Vomit is a most excellent Remedy, does
appear by this example.

5. A man of an ordinary condition, had at times a most violent Epilepsy which
arose from the Stomach: Before the Paroxysm there were rumblings and croakings
in his Belly, he voided much thick and clammy Spittle, his Head did swim, and
his Eyes grew dim.

6. He had tried for three years innumerable Remedies to no purpose; this
wretched man being in horrid pain by reason of his Fits that came seven or
eight times in a Month; and being too weak to bear such strong Medicines as
were prescribed him by Physicians, he asked my advice; to whom I prescribed a
very easy Vomit, which taking every day fasting for a year together, he was
cured of this violent Disease.

7. The Vomit was made of four ounces of the Decoction of dry Tobacco, with an
ounce of Oil of sweet Almonds, whereby he went twice or thrice to Stool, and
voided much clammy and snotty phlegm by Vomit, and broke Wind upwards.

8. Now whether a Vomit is good in Diseases about the Throat, although it seems
to carry humors in the Head, the most Learned Santorellus amongst all the
rest, Answers affirmatively, lib. 22. Antipraxis cap. 4. having very many
Reasons to back him.

9. Concerning which Argument Oribasius, lib. 1. Synop. 18. Market. 1. Indicat.
9. and the most elegant Fernelius, lib. 3. Method. cap. 2. have excellently
discoursed. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib. 1. Observe. 21.

XXXVI. A most excellent Remedy against the Falling Sickness.

1. A very young Boy was taken with a most fierce Epilepsy, who, in his
Paroxysm did so strangely toss his Head and Roll his Eyes, that if the
bystanders did not hold him in, he would throw himself out of the Bed upon the
ground.

2. When he was out of the Fit, he had several Medicines prescribed him, he had
an Issue made in the nape of his Neck, of the exceeding rare effects whereof
Jacchinus, lib. 9. ad Almans. cap. 14. Rondelet. cap. 37. Meth. Mercural. lib.
2. Varlect. and many others do speak much.

3. A Cucupha or quilted Cap, with Medicaments that strengthen the Brain was
put upon his Head, and Purgatives was given according to his years.

4. But nothing could recover him save this following Electuary, whereof when
he had for a month together taken a scruple every Morning fasting, he was freed
of his fits, and using the same afterward for two years together, he never
after found any hurt.

5. The Electuary was thus made: Take Confect. de Hyacintho, Conf. Alkermes,
Electuar. de gemmis, Laetificans Rhasis, of each a dram: Treacle of
Andromachus, half a dram: Smaragds, two drams: Bezoar stone, two drams and
half: Aromaticum Rosatum, Diamargaritum Calidum and Frigidum, Diarrhodon
Abbatis, of each half a dram: Diamoschum, one dram: Troches of Gallia Moschata,
one scruple: Pearls prepared, Granates prepared, Rubies prepared, each a dram:
red Coral, two drams: Male-peony, the seed thereof, Man's Skull, young Swallows
burnt, of each two scruples: powder of Bramble-Worms, of dry Rue, each a
scruple: burnt Hartshorn, Vnicorns-horn, of each a scruple: burnt Ivory,
Cinnamon, each a scruple and half: Crystal prepared, half a dram: Misleto of
the Oak, a scruple: Angelica, Rosemary-flowers, Lignum Aloes, of each a dram:
Dittany, Zedoary, Valerian, Been white and red, each a scruple and half: crude
silk torrified, a scruple: Galangal, Basil-seed, Cardamons, each a scruple:
powder what requires poudering very fine, and incorporate the same with this
following syrup: take seeds of Bawm, a dram: of Betony, two drams: flowers of
Stoechas, two drams and half: Indian Spike, half a dram: Sage, half a handful:
seeds of Annise, of Fennel, of each one dram: Indian Myrobalans bruised,
twenty: Borrage-flowers, a dram: Acorus roots, half a dram: boil them in four
pints of Water till half be wasted: to the strained Liquor add clarified Honey,
four ounces: white sugar, a sufficient quantity to make it into a syrup
wherewith make the foregoing species into an Electuary.

6. This I always found the most effectual Remedy in the World, to tame this
rebellious and stubborn Disease, and other cold Diseases of the Brain, both in
old and young people. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 22.

XXXVII. A cruel Epilepsy after Childbirth, cured by applying Horse-leeches to
the inner part of the Womb.

1. After Childbirth, especially when the Labor has been hard, a venomous
Air arises from the Prison of the Womb, by the retention of the suppressed and
putrifyed Blood, which breeds venomous and mortal Diseases, as Galen says in
his third Book. Epidem. Sect. 3. Com. 37. where he thus Writes.

2. For the suppression of the Courses is offensive, but not so much as when
they are suppressed after Childbirth; because they produce not only abundance,
but an exceeding great pravity of humors: for the Child drawing the better
Blood to nourish it self, and leaving the worser behind, Causes the Childing
Woman to be full of bad Humors, which Nature voids after Childbirth, etc.

3. A woman upon this occasion, was taken with a most Cruel Epilepsy, with the
loss of her understanding and senses: who because of the urgent danger, was
twice let Blood in the saphena vein, because she was but a little purged after
her Childbirth, and other revelling remedies being applied the same day to the
Original of the Flux.

4. At last three Leeches were applied to the inner part of her Womb, with
Strings tied to them, that they might not creep in, loosing a great quantity of
Blood, she was better and her Epileptick fits ceased. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib.
1. Observe. 23.

XXXVIII. The Falling Sickness in Women with Child, arising from their Wombs,
are safely Cured by Bleeding in the Ankle.

1. A Gentlewoman being in her seventh month with Child, of an excellent habit
of Body, of a close Contexture, have wide Veins, full of Blood well digested,
was miserably afflicted with a vehement Epilepsy.

2. In her Fits, her Countenance being ruddy, and her Eyes full of Blood; the
Physicians by reason of the danger of the Disease was of opinion that it was
the best way to let her Blood; but in what part to open a Vein they knew not
well.

3. For if the Epilepsy be from the Womb, bleeding in the Arm would avail
nothing, because we are to see to the original and the beginning thereof: If we
should let her Blood in the Ankle, the Child would be endangered and choked by
drawing much Blood to the Womb, in so full a Body.

4. Being puzzled by these Reasons, they were at a stand, and so sent for me; I
came and let her Blood three times in the Saphaena Vein, by which she was
perfectly cured, and was delivered of her Child in a good time, and in due
season. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 24.

XXXIX. The Epilepsy took a Woman with Child in her ninth Month, she was cured
by application of Leeches to the Hoemorrhoid Veins.

1. A Woman in her ninth Month by the obstruction and stoppage of a Customary
evacuation by the Hemorrhoids, fell into a very fierce Epilepsy, upon which she
grew extremely Melancholy.

2. Besides Clysters and Diversions of the Inferior parts, and the Veins of
both Ankles opened, she could not be cured, till she had Leeches three times
applied to her Haemorrhoid Veins; whereupon she grew well and was safely
delivered of a Child. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib. 1. Observe. 25.

XL. The Epilepsy in a Man, he was delivered herefrom by frequent opening the
Saphena Vein.

1. A man forty years old, both strong and well Complexioned, was diverse times
afflicted with such violent Epileptick Fits, that it was feared it would turn
into an Apoplexy.

2. He had both in and out of his Fits many good Medicines applied to him, and
the phlegmatic humor was frequenty purged; for it was supposed to be the Cause
of the Malady.

3. This mighty Herculean Disease was at last overcome by Blood-letting. He was
let Blood out of his Fits, every month in the Ankle, the Vessels being emptied,
and the plenty of Blood being evacuated, which was caused by the Constitution
of his Liver, which bred too much Blood, and the Blood being drawn to the
remote parts of the Body, and keeping a good Diet, he was afterward freed from
his Disease.

4. It was said by a famous Physician, Those that are subject to the
Falling Sickness, must bleed in their Legs to preserve them from their Fits;
there is a Falling Sickness from Blood, which he has showed in many places, and
among the rest is explained by Petrus Salius, lib. de Curat. Morb. Partic. Cap.
3. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 26.

XLI. The Epilepsy, in a Wonan that had her Courses actually flowing, is Cured
by a Vein opened in her Nose.

1. A young Woman well made and strong, fell into a grievous Epilepsy, which
was ushered in by a swimming of the Head, and dimness of sight, and followed by
a total oblivion of all things.

2. Her Courses at the time of her fit did duly flow, she was let Blood in the
inferior parts, but was not thereby cured: and the Disease proving very
dangerous by its acuteness, Cupping-glasses being first applied to her Thighs;
I took Blood from her Cephalic Vein.

3. Cupping-glasses were set to her shoulder-blades with scarification; she was
also let Blood in the forehead, and lastly, a vein being opened on the tip of
her Nose, she began to speak and came to her self. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1.
Observe. 27.

XLII. The Epilepsy cured by Stibium.

1. The most Renowned of the Modern Physicians have been of the mind, that
prepared Stibium, (commonly called Antimony) has a divine faculty to vanquish
Melancholic Diseases, especially when the dreggy humor is far from the first
passages of the Body.

2. I saw a Porter, who after strange motions of his Hands and Tongue, extreme
Headache, paleness, turbulent Imaginations of Ghosts, turnings of his Head, and
dimness of sight, did fall to the ground, as if he had been Planet stricken, and
when he was on the ground he did shake his body so violently, and turn his Head
round about, that you would think he was possessed by the Devil.

3. This man had used many remedies for a year together, but to no purpose: For
he was taken three or four times or oftener in a month, and could not be rid of
this vexatious Disease.

4. And because the breeding of this Melancholy humor could not in any wise be
hindered, and it was so rebellious, that it would not give way to Purgations:
at last having taken four times the spirit of Stibium rightly calcined in Wine,
and having voided upwards and downwards, much clammy Phlegm, mix with a large
quantity of Melancholy, he was cured of this sad Disease. Zacutus Lusitanus,
lib. 1. Observe. 28.

XLIII. The Epilepsy proceeding from an old Ulcer, shut up in the tip of the
Nose, cured by an Issue made in the Leg.

1. There came to me a woman seventy years old, in the tip of whose Nose a
filthy Ulcer broke forth once every three months, sending forth a great
quantity of a Virulent humor for three days, after a while the part was
covered with a Scar.

2. And having for eighteen years together been troubled with this Malady, and
yet otherwise lusty and in good health, having no pain in any part of her Body,
and now growing weary of this loathsome Disease, especially when the Ulcer was
open and running, by the advice of a Quack salver, she laid Diapompholygos
thereunto.

3. A day was not past, till she fell into a dreadful Epilepsy, having before a
grievous Headache.

4. Being sent for, I presently let her Blood at the Cephalic vein, gave her a
sharp Suppository, bound her Thighs till they ak'd, and so she was free from
her fits.

5. Because her old Evacuation was stopped for six months, she continued like a
Fool, and out of her senses; making no Answer to such Questions as were put to
her: I ordered her a purge to draw the retained humor from her Head, which was
wont to be evacuated.

6. This evacuation doing no good; and she her self saying, That in the first
day when the humors did flow through the opened Ulcer in her Nose, she felt
the humor arising from her Lower parts, and an heat in the Region of her share.

7. Considering this, I thought how to Recall the humor to the Original of the
fluxion; and having caused Issues to be made in her Thighs, near the fountain
of the Malady, and the humor flowing therefrom; she was no more troubled with
her Dotage, the Falling Sickness, and her old Ulcer. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1.
Observe. 29.

XLIV. A strong Epilepsy in a Woman, that bore three Daughters, presently after
which she died thereof.

1. A Woman forty years old, having accustomed her self in the time of her
being with Child to Eat good Cheer and Drink good Wine, got an Athletical habit
of Body; her Body was large, goodly and well set, her Veins full of Blood, she
bled sometimes at the Nose.

2. This Woman in her ninth month brought forth two Daughters, and after she
was delivered of the third, there remained some Portion of thick Blood in the
Womb, out of which a venomous Vapor arising, did trouble and vex the Brain,
which afterward did bring the Epilepsy, wherein she did wreath all her Joints,
and voided abundance of froth out of her Mouth.

3. In her last fit her strength being spent, and her Disease being Conqueror,
she died. Wherefore, as Hippocrates says, Aphor. 1.3. these Athletick and full
habits of Body are dangerous, not being able to advance, they go back and grow
worse.

4. For as Seneca says, whatever is come to its utmost height, makes have to
its End. And therefore it is a saying of Cornelius Celsus, When a Man seems
more full, more goodly and better colored than he has wont to be, he ought to
suspect all is not well with him. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Obs. 30.

XLV. The Falling Sickness in a Boy frighted with the shooting of Guns, died
thereof.

1. That terror, sadness, and other passions of the Mind, may cause the
Falling Sickness, is so far from being doubted, that it is confirmed in all
Authors; more especially in Children, who being very tender and fearful, are
more subject to sudden Maladies.

2. A Boy being naked upon the Sea shore, where he had been a Swimming, and a
Gunner to take his Farewell discharging some Ordnance, which the Boy was not
awar of; who unexpectedly hearing the report of the Ordnance, fell suddenly to
the ground, and wallowed and tumbled about, being in that Interim taken with an
Epileptick fit, and dyed within a quarter of an hour. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib.
1. Observe. 31.

XLVI. The Falling Sickness in a Child.

1. A Child of Mr. Walkers, of Amington Minister, aged six months, afflicted
with the Falling Sickness, by consent; was thus freed, first I caused round
pieces of Peony-roots to be hanged about the Neck.

2. In the Paroxysm, I ordered to be applied with a Sponge to the Nostrils, the
juice of Rue mixed with white Wine Vinegar, by which it was presently
recovered, and falling into the Fits again, it was removed in the same manner.

3. To the Region of the Heart was applied the following: Take Venus Treacle,
two drams: roots of Peony pulverised, half a dram: mix them: and thus the Child
was delivered from all its fits. Hall on English Bodies, Cent. 1. Observe. 35.

XLVII. The Epilepsy in a Man by reason of a Regurgitation of his Urine, was
with much a do Cured.

1. A stout French Captain, having been a long time afflicted with the stoppage
of his Urine, he fell into the said Disease by unseasonable drinking of cold
Water, so that he could not void so much as one drop of Water.

2. The Distemper would not admit of variety of remedies, so that having
retained his Urine for seven days, and it putrefying, sent up to his Brain a
stinking and noxious Vapor, which did agitate the same, whereby the Patient
fell into a grievious Epilepsy.

3. This Gentleman after an emollient, loosening and opening Bath,
Fomentations, Injections, and sundry Ointments, when the Urine was now spread
all his Body over, he became like one in a Cachexy.

4. In this miserable condition, he was much eased by Cantharides, whereof when
he had licked a scruple with Oil of sweet Almonds, he voided a stone with much
Snevil, and eight pints of Urine; and so was totally quit of his stoppage of
Urine and his Epilepsy. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 32.

XLVIII. The Falling Sickness is sometimes Hereditary.

1. The most intelligent of all Physicians does constantly avouch lib. de Not.
pueri, and lib. de aer. aq. and locis, that some Diseases do a rise from the
Parents seed, which Imprints a sickly and invalitudinary quality in the Child
like that which afflicted beforetimes the Parents; for it is voided from the
unsound parts of the Parents sickly seed.

2. So Grey-eyed persons beget Grey-eyed Children, distorted persons beget
distorted Children, Elephantick persons beget Children afflicted with the
Elephantiasis, a kind of Leprosy so called; persons infected with the
King's Evil beget Children tainted with the same Malady, Gouty persons beget
Gouty Children, Consumptive Parents beget Consumptive Children, Deaf Parents
beget Deaf Children, Parents troubled with the Stone, beget Children afflicted
with the same Disease; and lastly, Epileptick persons beget Children that are
Epileptick, or subject to the Falling Sickness.

3. I saw many years since an Epileptick Portugal, who had eight Sons and three
Nephews deplorably tormented many years together in the flower of their Age and
Strength with Epileptick fits, whereof all dyed.

4. There was an Infant, the Son of one of the Nephews, who being afflicted
with the same Disease, and having an Issue made in the Nape of his Neck, and
trying many cordial Medicaments, especially the Treacle of Smaragds was happily
cured; the excellent virtues of which Stone are wonderful in subduing this
rebellious and stubborn Disease. Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 33.

XLIX. The Falling Sickness by consent from the Stomach.

1. Mr. Fortescue, aged twenty years, was afflicted with the Falling Sickness,
by consent from the S^omach, as also Hypocondriack Melancholy with a
deprivation of the Sense and Motion of the two middle fingers of the right Hand.

2. His Urine was clear like Spring Water and heavy.

3. Having visited him, I thus proceeded, the fifth of June 1623. were
administered these Pills: Take Pilulae sine quibus, one dram: Foetidae, two
scruples: Castor, one scruple: with a sufficient quantity of Borrage-water,
make seven Pills; which gave three Stools.

4. At the conclusion of its Working, the Sense and Motion of the Fingers were
returned.

5. The sixth day there was drawn eight ounces of Blood from the Cephalic
Vein; the same Night at Bed time was given Pills of Amber, three in number.

6. The seventh day, he had three Stools; the eighth day, the following was
prescribed: Take the best Castor, Assa foetida, of each half a dram: the roots
of Peony well poudred, one dram: Aromaticum Rosatum, two drams: mix them with
the syrup of Mint, and make seven Pills; he took one of them when he went to
Bed.

7. The next Morning was given the quantity of a Nutmeg of the following: Take
Conserves of Bugloss, Borrage, Rosemary-flowers, of each one ounce and a half:
Confectio Alkermes, two drams: Laetificans Galeni and de Gemmis, of each half a
dram; the Powder of the roots of Peony, Birth-wort, of each one scruple: the
Raspings of Ivory, Hartshorn, Coral, of each two scruples: with the syrup of
Hyssop, a sufficient quantity, make an Electuary.

8. In the very Instant of the Paroxysm the following Fume was used: Take
Benjamin, Mummy, black Pitch, of each one scruple: mix them with the juice of
Rue, and make a Perfume.

9. You may also anoint the Nose with the same more Liquid. Observe, That in
the Morning before the Electuary was taken, there was used this Sneezing Powder.

10. Take Pyrethrum, roots of Peony, of each two scruples: black Hellebore,
half a scruple: make a fine powder; by these means he was cured. Hall on
English Bodies, Cent. 1. Observe. 29.

L. The Falling Sickness with the Scurvy.

1. A Gentlewoman long labored of a scorbutic Epilepsy; always at her first
falling into it, it was with a Fever, and Convulsive motions with the rest of
the signs in Engalus and Sennertus.

2. In the fit she was most miserably vexed with cold horror, and concussion of
the Members for half an hour, so that the whole Body shoke, the fit lasted ten
hours, she not knowing nor feeling any pain.

3. After in the same day she labored of another fit for six hours, and was
delivered from it beyond the expectation of the bystanders; after she fell
asleep, when a-walking, she had another Fit, wherein she said, she had vehement
pain: Moreover there was Concomitant with these things, a Jaundice, with a
dimunition of her Terms.

4. I cured her with the prescription following: Take Electuary Ventriflu, six
drams: Cremor Tartari, one scruple: Rhubarb in powder, two scruples: mix and
make a Bolus. It gave her six Stools.

5. For her filthy or noisome Jaundice, I gave her this: Take Mithridate, one
dram: Hartshorn prepared, two scruples: powder of Worms, two drams: Conserve
of Barberries, one ounce: mix them; to be given in two Mornings: by this she
was freed from her Jaundice.

6. Afterward, I thus purged her: Take Pil. foetidae, Pilulae Aloephanginae,
Pilulae Cochiae, of each one scruple: Agarick trochiscated, half a scruple:
Castoreum, six grains: and with syrup of Stoechas, a sufficient quantity, make
seven Pills: she took three of them at Night going to Bed, and the other the
Morning following.

7. This done, I used the following Sternutatory: Take Nutmegs, Peony-roots, of
each half a dram: black Hellebor, one scruple: Pyrethrum, white Pepper, of each
half a scruple: mix and make a powder. A small part of this was blown up her
Nostrils.

8. Whilst the time of the fit was expected, there was given every Morning, two
drams of the following Electuary: Take Conserves of Scurvey-grass, two ounces:
Dianthos, Conserve of Betony, old Mithridate, Venice Treacle, of each one
ounce: Misleto of the Oak, shavings of Hartshorn, Peony seeds, Man's Skull, of
each in fine Powder, four scruples: mix them. This was taken by it self, and
sometimes with Betony water, with a few drops of Oil of Vitriol: By this means
show was perfectly recovered, and remained well for many years after. Hall on
English Bodies, Cent. 2. Observe. 17.

LI. The Falling Sickness in a Country Girl.

1. A certain Country Girl, something more than twenty years of Age, of a good
habit of Body, but pale Complexion, being a Servant Maid, was siezed several
times with Epileptick fits, and much weakened thereby.

2. The 29 of January, in the year 1597. she was brought to Me, and my Counsel
was desired: I ordered the use of the following things: First, she was purged
with my usual Electuary: Afterward, I opened a Vein in the Arm.

3. Thirdly, she took this following Wine: Take Peony-roots dried, half a
pound: roots of Orrice, of Elecampane, of each one ounce: leaves of Sage,
Marjoram, Ground pine, of each half an ounce: Fennel-seeds, two drams:
Peony-seeds, half an ounce: bruise or beat all well together for two gallons of
Wine: she drank a draught of it every Morning; afterward she took a little
Broth.

4. She used these things to the 17 of February following, at what time she
returned with her Father; in the mean season she had only one fit: I ordered
her again to open a Vein, but in the Foot; because her Courses came down with
much difficulty, or but slowly.

5. At last she was wholly freed from her Disease, and continued again in her
former Service; nor afterward was ever any more troubled therewith. Platerius,
Observat. lib. 1. page 28.

LII. The Falling Sickness in a Child.

1. A little Girl, was for three days almost taken with fits of the
Falling Sickness, in the year 1558. I ordered, that the juice of Rue should be
mixed with the strongest Vinegar, and to be applied with Spunges to her
Nostrils, when the Paroxysm should sieze her: I was done, and she immediately
came again unto her self; but then she would presently fall into the same
again, the former things were again applied; by this means the fits became
shorter.

2. To the Region of the Heart we applied this Emplaster: Take Venice Treacle,
one dram: Peony-roots in powder, half a dram: mix them and apply it. Also her
Head was strewed over with Powder of Peony-roots: by this means beyond all hope
she was cured. Platerius, Observat. lib. 1. page 29.

LIII. A continuing Falling Sickness with a Lunacy in a Maid grown up, which
never had her Flowers.

1. The Daughter of a certain Tailor of a pale Color, Melancholic, having
been affrighted with the Sight of a person in a Paroxysm, fell into an
Epilepsy, which continued for many years.

2. Upon a sudden she would often fall down to the ground, but more frequently
about the the time of the new Moon, hurting her self extremely by her fall and
the inordinate motion of her Body.

3. Her Flowers in the interim were all together suppressed, which were never
seen, though many Remedies were used to help them.

4. In the year 1558. trusting to Art in the beginning of my Practice, that I
might effect here somewhat, and get to my self a good name, I fell about the
Cure of her Distempers. This following Apozeme was used for a Preparation: Take
Roots of grass, of Asparagus, of Madder, of each one ounce: Roots of Florentine
Orrice, of Eryngo, of Acorus, of each one ounce and a half: roots of Peony
fresh gathered, two ounces: the leaves of Bawm, of Hyssop, of Mint, of Betony,

an half of the strained Liquor, dissolve a sufficient quantity of sugar; make
an Apozem which Aromatize with Cinnamon, one dram and a half: yellow Sanders,
one dram: Nutmeg, half a dram: use it five Mornings.

5. Which being done, she was the following day purged: Take our Diacarthamus,
the Electuary Indi majoris, of each two drams: with a Decoction of the roots of
Peony that is fresh, two ounces: make a Potion.

6. Let her take another day this Bole: Take Methridate, one dram: the roots of
Peony pulverized, one scruple, and a little Sugar: mix them.

7. Afterward let her hold these Tablets in his Mouth: Take juice of
Liquorice, six drams: choice Cinnamon, two drams: Ginger, one dram: Mace,
Clove-gilli-flowers, Nutmegs, Cubebs, of each half a dram: seeds of Peony, one
dram: sugar Candy, four ounces: let them be made up with the Infusion of Gum
Tragacanthum.

8. Put the following Powder in a Cucupha, and then wear it all Night: Take
Mastich, half an ounce: the roots and seeds of Peony, of each two drams: roots

Rosemary, of Sage, of Peony, of each half a dram: Mace, Clove-gilli flowers, of

each one dram: Spicknard, Mace, Cubebs, of each half a dram: of both kind of
Coral, two drams: the Rennet of a Hare, one dram: with the syrup of fresh
Peony, a sufficient quantity, make an Electuary.

11. The use of these being continued for almost a whole year, she was freed
from her Paroxysms. Now when she was thought to be perfectly recoved, she
partly of her own accord, and partly by my advice Married, if peradventure
thereby her Terms might be provoked.

12. Though for some time living well and in a good habit of Body in her
Married Estate, yet she still had not her Terms; for which Cause I ordered her
a Pessary, which was not convenient to be used before her Marriage.

13. Take roots of Asarum, Agarick, of each two drams: Myrrh, the leaves of Rue
dried and Marjoram, of each one dram: the seeds of Peony, half a dram: Nutmegs,
two scruples: bruise them all together, and make them up with Rosemary-flowers,
and add thereto the Gall of an Hog, one dram: make Pessaries.

14. By the use of those Medicines in the place of the Menstrua a wheyish sharp
kind of humor Issued forthwith Extreme pain about her flanks, yet scarcely any
thing Bloody appeared.

15. This person thus restored after a year fell again into the Epilepsy, by
reason of a new Terror; a vein was opened in the Arm first, and in the Foot
the following day.

16. Afterward she was thus purged: Take roots of Liquorice, Peony, of each
half an ounce: roots of Asarum, two drams: Polypody of the Oak, three drams:
Carthamus, two drams: Epithymum, half a dram: Turbith, one dram: Anni-seed, one

half a dram: Diaphoenicon, Diacarthamus, Diasenna, of each two drams: with
Oxymel of squills, make thereof an Electuary.

18. And use successively now and then Tablets: and sometimes the following

and spicknard, the Raspings of Hart's-tongue, of each half a dram: sugar
dissolved and boiled with the juice of Peony, four ounces, make an Electuary.

20. She was for a long time freed from the Paroxysm by the use of these
things. But very easily, and on any light occasion, such as the Checks of her
Husband, her fits returned; when she remained any time without frights, her
Paroxysms returned not so often, at length being suddenly taken or stricken,
and her Temples being hurt, not long after Died. Platerus, lib. 1. Observe. 21.

LIVE. A daily Epilepsy which had its Original from a Tumor in the Hand,
afterward turned into an Ulcer.

1. A certain Man had a Tumor in the Palm of his Right hand, under the root of
his little Finger, with a pain which with the Tumor did grow; after a few days
being sadly afflicted he was taken with an Epilepsy that did cruelly shake him,
whereby he was deprived of his senses.

2. The fit being over, he took the usual Medicines in that Case: But the
Paroxysm returned after a fortnight: and again within a Week: for which the
following Cure was ordered.

3. He was Purged thus, the 13 of August 1601. Take the roots of Peony, two
ounces: Polypody, one ounce and a half: the leaves of Sena, two ounces:
Epithymum, half an ounce: Fennel-seed, two drams: Fumatory, one handful: make a
decoction in water and wine, to be taken three several times.

4. Afterward he used the following powder: Take the skull of a Man beaten to
powder, two drams: the roots of Peony, Asses-hoof, of each one dram and a half:
the Ashes of Swallows, one scruple: Misletoe of the Oak, half a dram: the
raspings of Ivory, one dram: sugar to the weight of them all: make a powder,
and let him take thereof a spoonful every morning, drinking over and above the
water of the flowers of Peony, one dram and a half.

5. He was purged afterward the third of September, after this manner: Take
Tartar two drams: Diagrydium, half a scruple: Annis-seed, half a scruple: roots
of Peony, half a dram: White sugar, six drams: make a powder to be taken at
three several times.

6. On the 12 of September he began to take the following Electuary: Take the
fresh sea-Oniyon cut, the best Honey, of each two ounces: Misletoe of the Oak,
one dram: the leaves of Hyssop, Rue, of each half a dram: Agarick, one dram:
Mans-skull, two drams: let them stand in the Infusion for three days in the
Sun: then strain out the juice and boil it a little: take a spoonful of this
twice a week.

7. By the virtue of these two last Medicines he felt the Paroxysm to be no
worse than a shaking or vellication in the Hand and Foot without the least
mutation of sense or motion; from whence there was hope of Recovery.

8. On the 18 of September, a shaking or convulsive Palpitation did seize him,
first in the Hand, and then like unto a vapor descended into his Feet, which
though he was thereby shak'd, yet did not fall.

9. On the 25 of September, after the use of these Remedies, lest nature should
be too well aquainted or accustomed to them, they were thus changed: Take old
Treacle, six drams: the roots and seeds of Peony: Misletoe of the Oak, of each
two drams: Basil and Clary-seeds, one dram: Mans-skull, half an ounce: with the
Honey of squills, make thereof an Opiate, and give him one dram when he goes to
Bed, and continue it.

10. Moreover he sweated in a dry Bath once; after the use of the Opiate, and
he found himself much strengthened.

11. On the last of September, the Tumor in his Hand was much increased, being
also very red and painful, he said, That the beginning of the praecedent
Paroxysms did arise from thence, and did sensibly feel something as it were
cold like Ice, trickling down from thence into his Arm, afterward from the Arm
to the Feet, and did then overspread his whole Body before he fell down to the
ground.

12. Being admonished by these indications, lest he should be in any danger
through his falls, he would presently prevent it by sitting or lying down.

13. Emplastrum Diachylon was applied to the Tumor, for the space of a whole
month, which was often removed, and he wore the same till the swelling was
ripned, or brought into an Abcess, which yielded a large quantity of purulent
matter; being now free from the fit, he complained of nothing more.

14. But the first of November, he was taken with another gentle fit of the
Epilepsy: the following day he took these pills: Take Pil. Cochiae, Pil.
Aureae, of each half a dram: with Peony-water, make nine pills: these made him
go plentifully to stool. The Ulcer in his Hand was committed to the care of the
Chyrurgian.

15. The Eleventh of November, he feared that he should be seized with another
fit: I caused a Cautery to be applied to the hinder part of the Neck, making an
Eschar by burning with a red hot Iron, which fell off the twenty first of
November: And the Ulcer being opened as is usual, it was so kept and handled;
from which time notwithstanding he seemed to have certain proffers of a fit;
and although they were not so great as to cause him to fall down, yet they grew
stronger and stronger.

16. The twenty eighth of November, The following pills were ordinarily given:
Take Castoreum, Assa faetida, of each one dram: Gum Ammoniacum, Sagapenum, both
dissolved in Vinegar of squills, of each two scruples: Ox-Gall one scruple: Oil
of Amber eight drops: with juice of Peony-roots, make Pills weighing half a
scruple: of which let one be taken at night going to bed, for several times.

17. The fifteenth of December, he was again purged with this: Pilulae
Aggregativae three drams: with Peony-water, make Pills: they gave in two days
eight stools. And he drank the following Wine: Take roots of Peony, four
ounces: Orrice, Elecampane, of each half an ounce: leaves of Sage, Marjoram,
Chamaepitys, of each two drams: seeds of Peony, three drams: seeds of Fennel,
one dram: cut and bruised and put them into three quarts of Wine: of this he
drank a draught every morning.

18. From the time that his Issue ran, which was for the space of six weeks; he
was free from any fit: and after the use of the aforesaid wine, he said, That
he found those Palpitations or Convulsive motions in his Feet to cease; but to
that, they remained as yet in his Arm.

19. Wherefore I applied to his Arm a Cautery, the second of January, 1602. by
reason of the induced Ulcer, he said, that he felt for three or four Nights a
light Convulsion in his Fingers, but no where else: wherefore, I purged him
again with Pilulae Agregativae the 20 of January, and ordered him anew, the
aforeprescribed Wine, which he drank to the third of February following: a
third Cautery I caused to be put to the sole of his right Foot, and again
purged him with the aforesaid pills.

20. And feeling yet some relics of his Disease, I caused him then to take
the following Electuary: Take roots of Peony, of Pyrethrum, of each one dram:
seeds of Hyssop, of Peony, of each two drams: Honey of squills a sufficient
quantity to make an Electuary, mix them, and let it be taken every morning: the
Disease was carried off by the Cauteries, and from the first of November, he
fell no more.

21. About the end of March, he was Plethorick, for which a vein of his right
Arm was opened, and repeated the Electuary prepared with man's skull and
Peony-roots: from thenceforth the fits no more returned.

22. Now all the Complaint was about the Ulcer, which was become Fistulous, the
bone adjacent being rotten; for the Cure of which he repaired to the Hospital,
where he was healed, after which for a year and some months, being perfectly
well, not long after, viz. the 30. of January, 1603, being in a desperate humor
he privately made away himself. Platerus, Observe. lib. 1. page 24.

LV. A falling sickness, from too great Intention of Mind.

1. At a public Commencement of Doctors, one of the Candidates fell down,
while he was praying; the whole man was without sense and motion, in which fit
he was carried out into a private room, and stayed there a little space, till
by comforting and reviving things he came to himself.

2. Being doubted, whether it was a swooning or an Epilepsy? and having
declared, that he was never troubled with the like before: I at last Judged it
might be a species of a Catalepsis, proceeding from a too great Intention of
the mind, upon his Oration, that he might repeat it well amongst so great a
multitude; as also his precedent day and night studies, to prepare him for
Disputation and Examination, and the weakness of his Head and the abundance of
Melancholy humors.

3. Fearing least the fit should return, and having a great weakness of Body, a
pain and heaviness of his Head, I ordered him to be purged with this following
Medicine: Take the syrup Roses solutive made with the Infusion of Rubarb and
Sena, one ounce: Catholicon, half an ounce: mix them with Bugloss-water, of
both sorts: and drink thereof.

4. The following day being the ninth of December, he took this preparative:
Take syrup of Hyssop and Fumetory, of each one ounce: Betony-water, two ounces:
Cinnamon, half an ounce: mix them, and make a Julep.

5. Afterward by turns he was purged for three days, the 10, 11, 12 of
December: Take the five opening roots, macerated in Wine, of each half a dram:
the roots of Bugloss fresh, one ounce: the roots of Peony fresh, one ounce and
a half: Bark of Tamarisk, six drams: the roots of Liquorice, one ounce: the
leaves of Hyssop, Fumetory, Bawm, time of each one handful: Cordial flowers,
one pugil: Fennel-seeds, two drams: Annis-seeds, one dram: Peony-seeds, one
dram and a half: Raisons of the sun, half an ounce: the leaves of Sena, one
ounce and a half: Polypody, two ounces: Epithymum, half an ounce: make a
decoction in which Infuse Agarick, three drams: Ginger one dram: add thereto a
sufficient quantity of sugar: aromatize with Cinnamon, and then use it.

6. On the thirteenth of December, being the fourth time, I ordered this last
purgative Medicine: Take Rhubarb infused in Endive water, and strain it out by
pressing four scruples: juice of Roses, two drams: syrup of Roses solutive with
the Infusion of Sena, six drams: make a potion:

7. Afterward he used this Electuary: Take the Conserve of the flowers of
Staechas; Rosemary, Sage, Betony, flowers of Peony, of each one dram: Conserve
of the flowers of Cichory and Violets, of each half an ounce: the roots of
Pyrethrum, the leaves of Hyssop, of each one dram: the seeds of Basil: the
roots of Peony, of each half an ounce: with Honey of squills, make an
Electuary; let him take every other dayone Bolus.

8. On the 22 of of December, because of some accidents I prescribed the
following purgative potion: Take Tablets of Diacarthamus three drams: syrup of
Roses solutive, with the Infusion of Agarick and Sena, one ounce: Sage and
Hyssop-waters, a sufficient quantity; By which he was well purged and
alleviated.

9. The following day for Corroboration sake, I gave him a Bolus of Conserve of
Marjoram and Roses, of each one scruple: I ordered afterward the following
Troches to masticate and spit: Take Nutmegs, one dram: roots of Pyrethrum,
Mustard Seed, of each two scruples: Cubebs, Pepper, Galangal, root of Angelica
of each one scruple: Mastich, half a dram: make a powder, make them up in Wax,
to the bigness of a filberd Nut.

10. About the latter end of December, having felt himself pretty well, and
preparing for his departure, he asked my Directions how he might preserve
himself from the same affliction, to whom I prescribed the following purging
Electuary which he might take weekly.

11. Take Catholicon, Cassia Extracted with Sena, of each one ounce: the juice
of Roses, Diaphenicon, of each three drams: Cinnamon, two drams: Cloves, half a
dram: with the syrup of Roses solutive, make it like an Electuary: let him take
two or three drams according as he finds it to work, drinking thereupon
Peas-Broth or the Broth of red Ciches.

12. The day after the use of the purging Electuary, let him take one Tablet of
the following, which is good for any distempers of the Head: Take three
Nutmegs: the root of Pyrethrum, one dram: the leaves of Sage, Marjoram, the
flowers of Lavender, the flowers of Rosemary, of each half a dram: the seed of
Nigella, one scruple: Cinnamon, one dram and half: Cloves, Galangal, of each
half a dram: Man's skull prepared, the Ashes of Swallows, of each half a dram:
sugar six ounces: dissolved in Sage-water, make Tablets, each a dram and half.

13. Let him intermit and rest the third day: and on the fourth day after
purgation, let him use the above strengthening and comforting Electuary,
prescribed.

14. Let him again abstain from Medicaments the fith and sixth day, but on the
seventh let him use again the purging Electuary: then the Tablets and
Comforting Electuary on the same days as is above mentioned, continuing this
order for some time.

15. Let him drink of the following water two or three spoonfulls, after the
strengthening Electuary once a week, which is a singular good defense against
the Epilepsy, it is thus to be prepared: Take young Swallows to the number of
ten: young Magg-pies to the number five: Rue one handful: roots of Peony, three
ounces: oil of Castoreum, one dram: species Diamargariton, Diamoschu, of each
one dram: pour to it good wine.

16. Let him ware at night the following Cucupha: Take the roots of
flour-de-luce, six drams: the roots of Cypress: the leaves of Marjoram,
Lavender-flowers, and the flowers of red Roses, of each one dram:
Coriander-seeds, two drams: the seeds of Nigella, one dram: storax calcined,
one dram and a half: make a Powder, and sow it to your night Cap.

17. Let him observe a good Diet, which should be moderate and simple,
temperance will be also necessary; in the beginning of the Spring, let him open
a Vein, and use the preparative and purgation, as is above prescribed.
Platerus, Observe. lib. 1. page. 29.

LVI. The Falling Sickness, with a Concussion of the whole Body.

1. A certain person of Delf, about the age of fifty, became Epileptick, and
the fourth of June, in the year 1558. was sudenly afflicted with this symptom,
his Eyes were swelled, and unmovable, his Teeth as it were set, in which
Condition he fell down, screaming, snorting, and foaming, and the Concussion of
his whole Body was exceeding strong.

2. Wherefore, lest by the concussion of the Teeth, his Tongue should be cut, I
put a wedge of Wood between his Teeth to help his Breathing, and to cause him
to avoid at his mouth the spume and humidity, then I applied, strong Frictions
to the outward parts and hard Ligatures to bring him out of the Paroxysm.

3. I also took Rue and rubbed between my Hands, which I applied to his
Nostrils; the Juice thereof I put up the same. I then nipt his Nostrills, and
wrong his Fingers, by which means he was freed from the fit.

4. But that he should not Relapse, having abundance of phlegmatic and
melancholic humors; I exhibited Hiera Picra, after which this following
Decoction was prescribed.

5. Take Betony, Hyssop, Balm, of each one handful: Sage, Marjoram, Bay Leaves,
of each half a Handful, or in the place of Bay Leaves, one ounce of the
Berries: roots of Bugloss, Borage, Peony, Polypody, of each half an ounce:
Thyme, Epithymum, of each one ounce: make a Decoction in a sufficient quantity
of fair water; strain, and add squils one dram: man's skull, a dram and half:
Nutmegs, one dram: boil it two or three minutes, and strain it again: let him
take of this Decoction four ounces every morning mixed with Oxymel of squills,
one ounce and half.

6. After this was done, he used the following Decoction: Take Betony, Sage,
Marjoram, Hyssop, of each one handful: flowers of Staechas, of Rosemary, of
each one pugil: seeds of Peony, and Fennel, of each three drams: roots of
Peony, half an ounce: Sena, half an ounce: Agarick, the best two drams:
Epithymum, a dram and a half: Polypody of the Oak, half an ounce:
Carthamus-seeds bruised, three drams: Raisons of the sun, one ounce: Liquorise
scraped, half an ounce: boil them in spring water a sufficient quantity, strain
it hard out: to nine ounces hereof add syrup of staechas, Oxymel of squills,
syrup of Betony, of each one ounce: mix for three Doses: to be taken in the
morning fasting.

7. Afterward I exhibited these pills: Take pil. Cochiae, de Hiera simplici,
of each a scruple: Agarick trochiscated, pil. Agregativae, of each half a
scruple: Troches alhandal, five grains: with honey of Roses make five pills.

8. The Body being thus purged let him take daily of the following Medicine to
the quantity of a Chestnut, by which he may be freed from the danger of having
any more of those fits he was frequently afflicted with.

9. Take Swallows, the feathers pulled off, then washed in wine and dried in an
Oven, number five, make them into a fine powder, to which add Conserve of Peony
flowers, prepared in the decrease of the moon, Conserve of Cowslips, of each
one ounce: roots of Peony, gathered in the decrease of the moon, (but I rather
think in the Increase) dried and poudered three drams: Conserve of
Rosemary-flowers, half an ounce: mix well together with a little Oxymel of
squills, adding a little Vinegar of squills, so much as may make it of the
thickness of an Electuary: it was not very pleasant to his taste, yet taking, it
cured him.

10. But that the Medicine might be more savory, take swallows deplumated, well
roasted basted with butter, and afterward with the Vinegar of squills: then
put them into an oven to be dried, so as that they might be beaten into a
powder, which you may mix with other things: I knew another Epileptick person
which did use the hearts of Swallows only pulveris'd and was cured; but to this
patient I gave the whole Swallows, with the rest of the things in powder, by
which he was made perfectly well. Forestus, lib 10. Observe. 53.

LVII. The Falling Sickness, in a Man threescore years of Age.

1. A certain Praetor, or chief Magistrate of a Town by the Sea side, being
sixty years of Age, overlooking the sea Banks, in a cold, moist and stormy
season of the year, he being a man very obnoxious to Catarrhs or distillations,
and almost always afflicted with the Gout in the Feet and other parts, fell
into a fit of the Epilepsy which he never had before.

2. Having used some praeparatory Medicines, his body and head being purged, I
gave him the following Confect: Take the Conserve of Rosemary-flowers, three
ounces: the powder of Peony roots dried, two drams and half: the powder of
Peony-seeds, one dram and half: with Oxymel simple, and the syrup of Staechas,
a sufficient quantity, make a Confect to be taken every Morning, four hours
before Meat, to the quantity of a Bean.

3. Afterward he was purged again with Pills thus prepared: Take Pil.
faetidae, Aloephanginae, Cochiae, of each one scruple: black Hellebor, three
grains: with the syrup of Staechas, make seven Pills, and take them after
Midnight.

4. Then give him every Morning, three hours before he eats, three drams of
these Tablets: Take the species Diamosci dulcis, species Diagalangae, species
Diacymini, (for he was troubled with a wind in his Stomach) of each one dram:
the powder of the roots of Peony, gathered in the decrease of the moon, half a
dram: with the decoction of a sufficient quantity of Bawm and Betony, add
thereto the best sugar; make a Confection in Tablets, according to Art.

5. Having used these remedies, he was no more troubled with fits, save that
once he had a small one in a Journey which he undertook: he purged twice a
year, and used the Confect and the Tablets, and so was freed in the space of
three years from his Epilepsy, but this old distemper of the Gout did sometimes
return to him, at last this ancient Gentleman dyed suddenly of an Apoplexy.
Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 54.

LVIII. The Falling Sickness whose Original is in the Brain.

1. A certain youth of Delf, was taken with an Epilepsy, sometimes in his
dwelling house, sometimes in the Church and Market, as he grew up so did the
distemper; sometimes he fell into the fire, and miserably burnt his Face and
Hands; his Head was extremely weakened by this Disease, insomuch as it seemed to
him to be pressed down with some heavy weight, it ack'd perpetually, and was
troubled with a Vertigo: his Face grew black, his Eyes dark, and his Smelling
and Hearing very dull: he began to stammer and faulter in his speech, his very
Thoughts were confused, melancholy, fear, forgetfulness, a profound sottishness
seized him, and most frightfull dreams did disquiet him.

2. Now that the abundance of Phlegm was the cause of this Disease, does appear
by these Indications: the Face was sometimes white, sometimes of a blackish
blue (by which I gather that a melancholy Juice superabounded) the Eyes did
run, the Nostrills were full of snivel, the Mouth extreme moist; his Head very
heavy, and his Eating very immoderate.

3. I ordered him a Diet which he would not observe: growing worse and worse by
the many fits he fell into, he became a Fool: and the Disease holding him for a
long time, we did prognosticate Death to him: such are seldom cured, if Age and
the Change of times be of no benefit to them: Otherwise I have prescribed to
those that have been long afflicted with the Falling Sickness, these two
waters; one described by Erastus, the other by Langius, which I Had from
Erastus after Langius his death.

4. The first this: Take flowers of Lillies of the valley, one pound and a
half: flowers of Peony, of Lavender, of Betony, of each one pound: the flowers
of Tile-tree of Cowslip, of each three ounces: the roots and seeds of Peony, of
each two ounces and a half: roots of long Birth-wort, one ounce and half:
Misleto of the Oak, one ounce six drams: Misleto, of the Filbert tree, three
drams: Cubebs, one ounce: black Pepper, Pontick Castoreum, of each half an
ounce: cut and bruise what are to be cut and bruised, and infuse all in Rhenish
or Mallago wine, three quarts for three Weeks, keeping the Vessel all the while
in a warm place, or in the heat of the Sun, and stirring it every day; then
distill in Balneo Mariae.

5. Seeing the leaves and flowers are not all at one time gathered, they are to
be Infused into wine, those first which appear first, and they are after three
weeks to be pressed out, then the liquor so pressed out is to be mixed with
wine, till you can have them all: they may be all taken dry, provided they be
dried in the shade, except the flowers of Lillies of the Valley.

6. Troches: Take the best Cinnamon, the roots and seeds of Peony, of each two
scruples: Ginger, Cubebs, Cloves, Mace of each one scruple: Nutmeg confected,
one dram: species Cordiales, species Aromatici, Caryophillati, of each half a
scruple: species Diambrae, Diamoschi, of each five grains: the seeds of
Citrons, hul'd, two scruples: dissolved in the water above mentioned, and make
troches, according to Art, like those which they commonly call Manus Christi.

7. As for the riches sort of people, they may take them Gilded, and made up
with distilled Oil of Aniseed, of Mace, or such like.

8. The second water which is Langius's is to be thus prepared: Take the
flowers of the Lillies of the Valey, seven handfuls: put upon them three pints
of Muskadine, or other generous Wine: let them stand in the Infusion five days,
distill them in Balneo Mariae, in a glass Bottle: afterward take choice
Cinnamon, six drams: Nutmegs, four drams: long Pepper, three drams: the flowers
of Lavender, one ounce: the flowers of Rosemary, and Staechas, of each half an
ounce: Jujubes, two drams: Misleto of the Oak, roots of Peony, roots of our
Dittany, of each half an ounce: being all somewhat grossly bruised, let them
again be macerated in the above mentioned wine, for eight days in some sunny
place, and afterward distilled; as is before directed.

9. Troches: Take Peony-seeds hul'd, half an ounce: Pearl prepared, half a
dram: Mace, one scruple: leaves of Gold, to the number of six, being beaten to
a powder, mix them with nine ounces of the whitest sugar dissolved in five
ounces of the water: boil it fit to make Lozenges withal.

10. The use of these waters is, pour into the Mouth one spoonful thereof in
the time of the fit, and bath the Jaws, Temples and Mostrills with the same, at
what time soever you fear the approaching of the fit, or if after short
Intervals it should return again, take Morning and Evening the same Medicaments
with the Troches aforesaid.

11. If the sick person is unwilling to eat them, let him take them dissolved
in the water.

12. Lastly, for preservations sake, let him take Morning and Evening at the
four quarters of the Moon, one spoonful with two Troches: Afterward all fear
being removed, it will suffice to take them thice a month, at the new and full
moons. Forrestus, lib. 10. Observe. 55.

LIX. The Falling Sickness in an Infant.

1. A Child of two months old, was continually afflicted, to whom I came, and
according to Galens opinion. I did hang a quadrangular bagg about his Neck,
that it might touch his naked Breast: Take the roots of Peony green, four
ounces: Male Peony-seed, which is black one dram and a half: the root being cut
and the seed bruised, were put into a Bag, and Cotton being added, was covered
with fine linen, like Cambrick or Lawn, which hanging about his Neck did touch
the Mouth of his Stomach.

2. By the virtue of this, his fits miraculously did cease, and never returned
again; in the mean time I ordered that his Nurse should give often the
following Linctus to the Child.

3. Take clarified Honey, two ounces: syrup of Staechas, syrup of the Infusion
of Damask roses, of each half an an ounce: mix them. The Child was healed by
these Remedies.

4. And many others were Recovered by the root only gathered green, and its
seed put into a Bag: we experienced the great virtue and good success of this
bag hung about the Neck: For a Child of three years of age, in our
Neighborhood was afflicted with the Falling Sickness, so that after one fit
came another, and that so frequently that his Recovery was very much doubted of.

5. Being Invited to give this Child a visit, I presently raised him by Rue,
rubbed and put up into his Nostrills, I also gave the seeds of Peony hul'd,
bruised in a little Beer, and the bag aforesaid, according to Galen, is to be
hung about the Neck.

6. In the same year an Infant of two years of age by the use of the same
remedies, viz, Rue put up into the Nose and a decoction of the seeds of Poony
in Beer, was not any longer troubled with fits.

7. I also Exhibited to these Children two or three grains of Unicorns horn in
Beer, not wine, for wine is not to be given to such. Forrestus, lib. 10.
Observe. 59.

LX. An Epilepsy in a maid, arising from a pituitous matter in the Brain.

1. This Maid, about eighteen years of age, having a moist Brain, and being
immoderate in her diet and secretly drinking thick Beer, For her Mother was an
Hostess, I did from thence conclude, that phlegm was the orginal of her
Epilepsy, and that it lay most in the Brain.

2. She was afflicted therewith before she had her Terms, and when she had
them, it did not cease, but her fits were rather more frequent.

3. Now, although there was less hope of the Cure of this dangerous Distemper,
because of her drinking and swilling, yet at the earnest Entreaties of her
Mother, and for pity sake, I would not altogether neglect to make a trial. But
I prognosticated all Medicines to be in vain, unless her Mother did prevail
with her to abstain, from drinking of thick Beer, and to forbear immoderation
in her other diets.

4. I advised her to keep in some upper Room, that was more hot and dry, and to
take great heed that she caught not cold in her Feet; because cold taken there
does immediately cause the Brain to suffer by consent.

5. Therefore I command that the Feet, as well as the whole Head, Neck and
Throat should be kept warm, and defended against the injuries proceeding from
Cold, for that the body being so provided, would be less hurt by any
unseasonable Wind or Air.

6. As also that the Mind should be troubled with no business, and that she
should avoid all Morning and Noon Sleep; for that the one does retain the
excrements of the Head; and the other does generate or beget a Catarrh.

7. I therefore ordered her to rise early in the Morning, and to refrain her
bed, and take a little walk after the same; But first that she should Comb her
Head; then that all the Excrements of the Head, falling down by the Pallat and
Nose should be taken away, and the parts cleansed.

8. That the Legs and inferior parts be exercised and well rubbed with course
Cloths: And that if possible (or, that nature might be made to require) to
evacuate the Excrements of the Belly and Blader, viz. by Stool and Urine.

9. I forbad her the eating of much and various kinds of Food; and that she
should not so much as touch any thing of a Quail; for that they have a natural
and innate property to induce the Falling Sickness, by stirring up or exciting
Epileptick, motions.

10. As on the contrary, Turtle doves or Pigeons, and chiefly all Birds which
live by rapine as the flesh of Vultures; also the flesh of Swallows, have
certain (as it were) occult quality, to resist the Epilepsy, and restrain
Epileptick fits.

11. Moreover field-Birds, and Birds of Mountains are more profitable and
proper to be eaten in this Disease, than such as have been fed, or crammed, and
kept up in Pens at home.

12. The flesh of Beasts or four footed creatures is to be rejected as hurtful.
Heloagabulus was wont to eat Camels feet, and the Combs take from live Cocks
and Hens; the tongues of Peacocks and Nightingals, which who so ever does eat,
it is believed, shall be free and safe from the Falling Sickness.

13. I also ordered her to abstain as much as might be from eating Fish, from
all sorts of Pudding, Pastry-Ware, things made of Milk, fried Meats, sower
fruits, Cheese, and hard Eggs.

14. For drinking I permitted her a thin Metheglin or Mead, but to abstain from
all strong wines, as also from strong and thick Beer or Ale.

15. As for Medicaments, I prescribed attenuating Syrups, such as syrups of
Staechas compound, Oxymel simple, and with squills, Honey of Roses, Honey of
Rosemary-flowers, with attenuating decoctions, made of Sage, Betony, Hyssop,
Primroses, roots of Peony, and such like: with Pills Aloephanginae, of Hiera
simple, and Hiera with Agarick, Pills of Mastich, Compound, Pil. faetidae, and
Cochiae, I caused her to be well purged.

16. Afterward I used Frictions and Ligatures, or binding of the extreme
parts; then Errhines made of Juleps of Beets, of Ground Ivy, of Primpernel, of
Rue, and of Marjoram, and Sternutatories or sneezing Powder, made of Pepper,
Hellebor, and Cloves: also a Masticatory made only with Pyrethrum with Mastich,
adding a little white pepper, to be continually chewed in the Mouth.

17. The Composition of Largus Scribonius, draws forth phlegm very powerfully,
she used also a Gargarism made of Peony roots, and roots of Pyrethrum, adding
Hyssop, Cubebs, Rue, and Honey of squills, or in place thereof, both sorts of
Oxymels.

18. Then for to comfort and strengthen the Brain, we gave her Mithridate or
Venice Treacle, after the first sleep; at length We consulted to give her
Auream Alexandrinam, and then the Confect of Nicolaus, with which an Epileptick
was cured, which had been troubled therewith for the space of forty years; the
Description whereof you may find in Guainerius.

19. Likewise the Bladder of a Wild Boar, taken and dried with the Urine in an
Oven (not too hot) and then poudred very fine, was given her, about a spoonful
at a time: and sometimes one dram of Man's skull prepared, both which were
exhibited in small Wine or Beer not very strong.

20. If these things had not reduced or restored her, I would then have applied
Cauteries to the Thigs or Legs, and kept them continually open after the manner
of Issues: And then give this following powder, to be taken every Morning
fasting, one dram at a time, in Chicken broth.

21, Take seeds of Peony, Man's skull levigated, of each three drams: Cloves,
Nutmegs, seeds of Citrons husked, of each one dram: mix and make a fine powder,
which keep for use. Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 61.

LXI. The Epilepsy in a young Man of fifteen years of Age, by consent from the
Stomach.

1. I am of Opinion, Sir, that your Son is afflicted with the Falling Sickness,
which I am confirmed in, from his great number of Fits, falling sometimes ten
times in a day, or more, as also from the turning of his Eyes, his sudden
falling, the drawing together of his Thumb; with Convulsive motions of his
whole Body, and his vehement screaming or crying out (as I understand from your
Friend;) but they were short and momentary, seldom continuing a quarter of an
hour.

2. When the fit first comes, it has its rise about the Stomach, or rather the
left Hypochonder, for that he is immediately sensible in those places of a
certain straitness or pressing.

3. Perhaps the Disease may affect the Brain by consent from the Stomach, or
from some dis-affection adhering to the Spleen or Bowels; and because of the
stinking and corrupt matter, existing in the Ventricle and Guts, the
Falling Sickness is communicated rather from those parts to the Brain than from
any other.

4. And having been afflicted for a year with the Disease, I did believe, that
although it had not its primary Original from the Brain, yet because of the
Assiduity of it, may now have its existence, and is confirmed therein, the Fits
coming frequently both before and after Meat.

5. In the Interim he had a great pain about his Stomach which vehemently
afflicted him, the Reason whereof is to be Inquired into, not forgetting the
Brain; which according to Hippocrates, lib. 5. Aphor. 7. and lib. 2. Aphor. 45.
it will be difficult to Cure, for that it has been of a long continuance,
except his Age (being twenty five years old) the place, his Diet, and the
season of the year shall conduce to free him therefrom.

6. And because you have asked my advise, concerning your Son, I think he cannot
Use a safer and better Diet, than that which is naturally drying, warming,
extenuating; inciding; being of good Aliment, easy of Concoction, and which
together strengthens the whole Body.

7. The Air, as also the region and place wherein he lives must be hot and dry;
and to be concise, all Non-natural things must also answer: these things are so
well known to your present Learned Physicians, that it will be needleess to
write any more.

8. But as to Medicines, which you seem to be most Earnest with me about, the
lesser good will be done by them, if the Rules for his diet be neglected.

9. Now my Method shall be to proceed from more light to more strong Medicines,
which I Judged more fit because of the weakness of his Stomach.

10. Therefore at first, take the following Lenitive Medicine: Take of the
Lenitive Electuary, six drams: Diaphaenicon, two drams: the powder of the roots
of Peony, half a dram: with sugar make a Bolus.

11. Or you may dissolve the same, if he should loath the Bolus, with the
Decoction of Wormwood, Hyssop, Betony, by adding half an ounce of the Honey of
Rosemary, or Roses, or I would dissolve it with the syrup of Betony, of
staechas, of Calamint, of honey of Roses, Oxymel simple and of squills, with
the decoction of Balm, Betony, Hyssop, Calamint, Wormwood, Borrage, Bugloss, or
the like.

12. I would have him purged with Pil. de Hiera, afterward Pills more
inciding, by adding some of the roots of Peony, being reiterated, I would
exhibet the following Pills: Take Pills of Mastich, pil. Aureae, Cochiae, of
each one scruple, with syrup of Wormwood, make seven pills.

13. But if he would rather use a decoction, let him take this or the like:
Take the roots of male, Peony, gathered in the decrease of the moon, half an
ounce: the flowers of Borage, Bugloss, Rosemary, one pugil: Wormwood, Calamint
of both sorts, Centuary, Pennyroyal, Bawm, Cowslip, Betony, of each one
handful: seeds of Peony, three drams: Polypody of the Oak, Misleto of the Oak,
of each half an ounce: the leaves of the best Sena, one ounce: seeds of bastard
Lovage, Caraways, of each a dram and a half: Raisons stoned, Liquorice scraped,
of each half an ounce: the best Agarick, two drams: white Ginger, one scruple:
boil them according to Art in Betony water, and Hyssop water, to one pound:
being strained, add the syrup of Hyssop, Betony, of Staechas, of each one
ounce: syrup of Epithymum, honey of Roses strained, of each half an ounce: mix
them for three doses, to be taken early in the morning.

14. These things are to be taken spring and Fall, and you may add (if you
please) to the Decoction one dram of black Hellebor: After purgation, both the
Head and Stomach is to be strengthened with Electuaries, and apt Confects of
Diagalanga, Aromaticum Rosatum, Diacorus, Conserves of Rosemary, Peony, Betony
and bastard Lovage, add the powder of the seeds and roots of Peony, and the
like, with the syrup of Betony and Calamint.

15. Also for the purgation of the Head, there are first to be given,
Apophlegmatisms, Errhins, Gargarisms.

16. Lastly, if these things should not help, I would use the decoction of
Lignum Guajacum, some Peony-root being added. Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 63.

LXII. The Falling Sickness in a Boy, by Consent from the Stomach.

1. This Child of eight years old, having exercised himself more than was
convenient, by play on the walls of Delf, fell down on the ground by a Vertigo,
from whence being very carelessly carried away into a House, he was taken
miserably with such a sudden violent Convulsion and long continuing Epilepsy,
that the Paroxysm lasted for four whole hours.

2. I came to him in this deplorable Condition, out of which he could not be
raised, though there were applied Ligatures and Frictions to the Inferior
parts; and his Feet with the soles of them were rubbed with Salt and Vinegar.

3. And seeing his Mandibles did continually move, and were distorted, I put a
wedge of Wood between his Teeth that he might not cut his Tongue, and that the
Phlegm might more conveniently flow out of his Mouth, Rue also being rubbed
between his Hands, was put up his Nostrils.

4. And when he could not yet be raised by what was before applied, I took a
feather dipped in the following mixture, which I put into his Jaws to provoke him
to Vomit.

5. For the Child (as it was related by one of his Play-fellows that was
present when he fell) did complain as if he had been before his fall disposed
to Vomit, I gave him a lincture in a spoon, his Teeth being separated, and his
Jaw Bone being opened, then I anointed his Jaws with a wet feather or quill.

6. Take Oxymel simple, of squills, syrup of Staechas, of each one ounce, mix
them, and then together the Backbone was anointed beginning at the neck and
descending to the Inferior parts with the following Oils: Take Oils of Rue,
and of sweet Marjoram, of each three drams: Oil of Cinnamon, one dram: mix them.

7. Let the futures be also anointed, a third part of hot Waters being added,
that they may acquire a penetration.

8. While we continued in this Course, the Child, about half an hour after the
lincture, vomited much water and pituitous matter, and at length was freed from
his fit.

9. I put also about his Neck (according to the Judgment of Galen) a
quadrangular Bag, in which was the root of green Peony bruised, it did hang so
far down as to touch the Ventricle.

10. Now, when he had done Vomiting, and was delivered from his fit, he came to
himself and could then tell how he felt a pain in his Stomach, before he fell
into the Epilepsy, which before he was never troubled with.

11. Moreover I commanded, lest he might again be assaulted with the like
violent Paroxysm, he should take for the two next days the following decoction:
Take Betony, Sage, bastard Lovage, of each one handful: Mint, Calamint,
Wormwood, either of the two, of each half an handful: roots of Peony, half an
ounce: seeds of Peony, two drams: the seeds of yellow Carrots, Annise, of each
one dram: the leaves of Sena, six drams: Agarick trochiscated, one dram:
Raisons stoned, one ounce: Liquorice scraped, half an ounce: boil them in
common water, to eight ounces: press hard out, add the honey of Roses strained,
the syrup of Staechas, of each one ounce: mix them for two doses, to be taken
in the Morning.

12. Afterward having anointed his Belly whith the Oils of Spicknard, of
Wormwood and of Mastich, it being sufficiently loose, he grew very well for the
future, and never had any more fits. Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 64.

LXIII. The Falling Sickness in a little Boy of three years old.

1. A little Boy of three years old was seized with an Epilepsy, who did void
dead Worms together with his Excrements; I thought (as it does appear very
largely in my Scholia) he might have fallen into his Epilepsy, by reason of
foul stinking Vapors, which were carried up into his Head.

2. But having given him the following powder in distilled waters, he grew well
immediately thereafter: Take Wormseed, the powder of the roots of Peony,
Agarick trochiscated, of each half a scruple: Diamoschi Dulcis, one scruple:
syrup of Vinegar simple, half an ounce: Waters of Wormwood, Baum, of each one
ounce: mix them.

3, I allow in the Intervals of the fits that he take often Worm-seeds rould in
sugar, For by the sweetness of the sugar Children are allured to swallow the
seeds, and the worms as it were more commodiously deceived.

4. Having taken these things, and the Worms being voided, he was hapily
dilivered from his Epileptick Convulsion. Forrestus, lib. 10. Observe. 65.

LXIV. The Falling Sickness arising from the Womb.

1. A certain Gentlewoman, of the age of twenty years, in the Spring fell into
an Epilepsy, by reason of the Restriction of her Terms, who with her Aunt came
to me.

2. And having understood the cause of this Malady, her body being first
prepared by purgations, I ordered the opening of the Saphaena Vein in her Foot.

3. She had her Terms as soon as the blood gushed out: and taking every Morning
the bigness of a Chestnut of this Confection, she had no more fits.

4. Take Conserve of flowers of Rosemary, one ounce and a half: Conserve of the
flowers of Bugloss, half an ounce: the species Diamoschi Dulcis, one dram and a
half: the powder of the roots of Peony, one dram and a half: the seeds of Peony
pulverised, four scruples: the seed of Juniper pulverised, half a scruple: with
the syrup of staechas, a sufficient quantity: make a Confect.

5. When she had used that, having breathed a Vein, she grew well, and was
never all her Life time obnoxious to any one fit.

6. A certain Woman at the Breil was freed from an Epileptick fit, by putting
up a sharp Pessary into her womb and hanging the following nodule about her
Neck, that the smell might always come into her Nostrils.

7. Take Assa faetida, one dram: Castoreum, one scruple: make a nodule to smell
to, and likeways I ordered the root of Peony, to be hung about her Neck, so as
that it might touch the Ventricle, and to bind her Belly with a large
swathing-band, least the suffocating Vapor ascend upwards.

8. Let her take also a decoction of Sage, Bettony, Bawm, Mugwort, Pennyroyal,
Hyssop, roots and seeds of Peony, with the leaves of Sena.

9. By which remedies, her fits returned not again, to the Amazement of all
bystanders, and was freed as well from the suffocation of the Womb as from the
Epilepsy.

10. But I had almost forgot, to tell how she had bitten off a little bit of
her Tongue, her Teeth being closed together in a fit, which I also cured by
this Lincture.

11. Take the yolk of one new laid Egg, mix it with the syrup of dry Roses, and
the Infusion of common Roses, like an Linament.

12. There was a Woman of the Hague, miserably afflicted with the suffocation
of the Belly, and the Epilepsy, and having taking Treacle mixed with Wine, by
the Counsel of another, she grew worse.

13. We gave her the powder of Masterwort, Gentian, and seeds of Daucus, of
each one scruple: with two or three spoonfulls of Drink, and having applied
burnt feathers of Partridges to her Nostrills, and the Hysteric plaster to
her Navel, round about which Galbanum was put, that it might stick, she thus
became well. Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 66.

LXV. The Epilepsy having its Original from the Feet.

1. A certain young man by profession a Cook, being of a strong Robust body and
excellent Constitution, in the month of January 1567; brought to me his Water,
which was crude and white.

2. Who said, That he felt now and then some pain in his right Foot, no Tumor
appearing all that while, which like unto a cold Air run swiftly through his
whole Leg, then presently evaporating to his Heart, last of all ascended up to
his Head.

3. Not long after he became Vertiginous and Epileptick, nevertheless his fit
lasted not long: Upon whose account I was consulted with, to whom I prescribed
the Receipt of the following purging Decoction to be taken twice.

4. Take Sage, Betony Pennyroyal, Hyssop, of each one handful: the roots of
Peony, gathered in the decrease of the Moon, three drams: Daucus-seeds, bastard
Lovage, Fennel, of each one dram and a half: leaves of Sena, six drams: the
best white Agarick, one dram and half: white Ginger, one scruple: Raisons of
the sun stoned, one ounce: Liquorice scraped, three drams: boil them all in
water to eight ounces: and being well strained, add Oxymel of squils: syrup of
staechas, of each one ounce: mix them, and make an Apozem for two doses: to be
taken every Morning.

5. Afterward, I commanded that whenever the fit came, he should apply
strong Frictions, and bind his Foot hard, with a broad swathing Band, thereby
to check the Vapors from ascending.

6. If these things help not, let him apply a Sinapism to the Foot thus pained,
or let him make a Cautery.

7. I Advised all things to be done, which Montanus, Consultatione 9. writes of
a German Child, afflicted with the Epilepsy by consent, out of whose Arm a
vapor like Air suddenly ascended to his Head, and brought an Epilepsy.

8. I ordered him to take now and then, out of his fits: these pills for the
subduction of the Belly: Take choice Rhubarb, two drams: Cloves, Cinnamon, of
each two scruples: Aloes, four drams: Agarick, three drams: seed of Peony, one
dram and half: mix them and with the Honey of Roses make up a Magdalen.

9. Also this Electuary is to be prepared: Take squils well roasted and
prepared according to Art, two ounces: seeds of Peony pulverised, one ounce:
the honey of Roses strained, or one pound of the best honey, mix them and make
an Electuary.

10. And for a purgation to be taken yearly, chiefly in the Spring we have
prescribed these things, take of the Lenitive Electuary, one dram: Hiera picra
simplex, two drams: make a Bolus, and let him take two hours before Meat,
Oxymel simple, syrup of Betony, of each one ounce: a Decoction of the grains of
Peony, Peony water distilled, of each four ounces: mix them together for to be
taken at seven times.

11. Afterward, Take Confectio Hamech, half an ounce: syrup of Roses solutive,
two ounces: with Peony-water, make a Potion; which is to be taken in the
Morning fasting.

12. I also advised him to keep as much as he could from the Fire; which yet he
could not will refrain, because he was a Cook; the Fire he knew (by experience)
was no Friend to him; he was also told, that going from the heat into the cold
Air was not good for him, especially it was naught for his Head.

13. Last of all, he was ordered to observe the Directions of Montanus in his 9
Consultation, both as to his Diet, and the Rule of his Life; for this Case
resembles somewhat that he there mentions, only differs in this, that the Vapor
or Air proceeded from the Arms of the one, and from the Foot of the other. By
these Remedies the Fits came but seldom, and afterward left him almost all
together. Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 67.

LXVI. A Woman big with Child seeing another in a fit of the Falling Sickness,
brought forth a Child Epileptick.

1. In the year 1599, a certain honest and pious Matron living at Cologn, who
was young, strong, and endued with a good habit of Body, being young with
Child, went about some affairs into the City, and chanced to see an Epileptick
person to fall almost at her very Feet, who cried out and tumbled and tossed
from one place to another; which object put this Gentlewoman into great fear
and consternation.

2. After a few Months she was happily brought forth of a Child, who was
unhappily and sadly afflicted with the Falling Sickness; to whom many Medicines
were exhibited by several Physicians of this City, and by me also; but all in
vain, the Disease grew so fast, that she dyed before she arrived at one year
old.

3. To me it seemed most probable, that the imagination of the Mother, was the
Cause of the Disease in the Child.

4. Another example the same Author produces of a Gentlewoman with Child, who
called to visit a neighbor of hers in a fit of the Falling Sickness, received
a blow on her Belly from the same person, who nevertheless came to her full
time, and was happily delivered, but the Child after a strange manner was
afflicted with the Epilepsy, for the space of twenty four hours, of which she
dyed. Fabritius Hildanus, Cent. 3. Observe. 8.

LXVII. The Epilepsy cured in a young Man, who was afterward blind.

1. This Epileptick person known to you, Sir, had one vehement fit that very
Night, we returned home from you: from that time an Apozeme being prepared, I
purged the peccant humors with Capital Pills, and he used an Electuary made of
Elks-hoof, Man's skull, and of Triangular Bones (by some mightily approved of in
this Disease) Hartshorn, the extract of the Misleto of the Tile-tree, Betony
and Sage, with Sugar, for the greater pleasure of the taste.

2. As also an Antepileptick Water of the flowers of Sage, Prim-roses, flowers
of Line, Peony and Betony sweetened with the syrup of Peony: which Medicines, I
pray God so to bless as he may recover his former Health, if not I have
appointed a Seton.

3. But while I writ of these things, a case not common and vulgar, concerning
the Epilepsy came into my thoughts, which possibly may not be unwelcome to you.

4. A certain Countryman, hard by, being a long time afflicted with an
Epilepsy, sent for an Emperick, being then about the Age of forty; this Man
gave him a violent purge, which wrought both up and down at one time; by the
benefit of which, even against the opinion of Hippocrates, lib. 2. Aphor. 42.
he was freed from the Falling Sickness.

5. But immediately after, he was through the Obstruction of the Optic Nerves
deprived of his sight; he lived four years, but never recovered his sight.

6. Another example, I shall give you of the like effect of this bad Artist's
Skill; another Countryman being for many years troubled with the Epilepsy, and
being now arrived at the twentieth year of his Age, received a violent purging
Potion from the aforesaid Emperick, he was thereby freed indeed from that
Disease, but yet very unhappily.

7. For not long after the peccant humors did flow down in such an abundance,
that besides an Inflammation in his right Eye, he had an insufferable pain in
his Head, which with the continual flux of the humors, brought at last, the
loss of his sight of that Eye.

8. Now, that his other Eye might be preserved, I prescribed him some
Medicaments to be taken now and then after a few days: For it is dangerous to
Cure suddenly, if it be not safely too.

9. Therefore Hippocrates prudently admonishes in lib. 1. Aphorism. 22. not
crude but concocted humors are to be healed and removed.

10. A crude humor, says Butinus, because of its thickness and coldness is in
motion flow, nor does easily yield to Physic; thence from the commotion of
them, bad Symptoms follows, and so much the worser, often time, by how much the
Medicine is gentler in its attraction, and the humor by its grossness stronger
in its resistance, or more fixed, or is immured between strait passages.
Hildanus, Cent. 5. Observe. 5.

LXVIII. A Falling Sickness arising from one of the Legs.

1. A certain Noble Youth being afflicted many years with the Epilepsy asked my
advice: That it was the Falling Sickness, the affections did declare; the signs
of which were, that the principal Faculties together with Sense and Motion were
subverted. When yet notwithstanding the perceiving it before hand, the short
stay of the fit; it not often invading, nor the disturbed Functions being
altogether corrupted or vitiated, do rather argue it to be a symtom than an
absolute Epilepsy; or rather a middle symptom intervening between an Epilepsy
and a Vertigo.

2. Of this Disease there are three kinds: the first proceeds from the vicious
temper of the Brain: another by consent from the Stomach; the third from any
other part of the body; this last is known by this token, that it falls not
suddenly without warning, but the Patient has a discerning of it, some little
time before it comes.

3. And indeed such was this of Our Patient: it cannot be accounted of the
first kind; for, before the fit, he discerns as it were a kind of subtle Spirit
or Vapor to arise or ascend by degrees from his said Leg, and from the great
Toe of the same to the Brain, and without doubt there the fountain of the
Disease is fixed.

4. But when (as it is wont to be with many men) the exhalations from the
inferior parts into the Head, are as it were perpetual in whom such a symptom
as here in our Patient does not arise; it is most evident that the exhalation
contains in it a malignant and venomous quality, which offends the Brain.

5. And it is very agreeable, that the Leg, from whence the cause comes,
should have been long vexed with Fluxes and Ulcers, whereof although the
Patient be free, yet it is most likely that there remains a bad quality in some
part, by reason of which the matter there gathered, partaking of that Venom,
and touching the Brain, by certain Intervals, hurt its Faculites.

6. But when it might be said, That he was often troubled with the pain of the
Stomach, and with the Cholick, it is not dissentaneous, that he is thus
afflicted through the Sympathy of these parts.

7. The Cause of this Distemper is a cold humor, and from thence it may be
concluded, the Disease is Chronick; the continual pain of the Stomach, as well
as the pain of the Cholick, do testify and show the Temperament to be cold and
moist.

8. The Curative Indications are these, viz. the evacuation of the cold humors,
the warming of the Stomach, the strengthening of the Concoction; the drying,
warming and strengthening of the Leg; and when the Head receives matter
transmitted from any other Cause, it is a certain sign that it is afflicted
with weakness.

9. Therefore endeavors must be used to strengthen it, that it may be the
better able to resist and beat off the assaults of such Enemies; although this
Disease be of its own nature very grievous, yet there is great hopes to be
conceived of a recovery.

10. For according to Hippocrates, those young Men that are afflicted with the
Falling Sickness, are freed very much by the change of Age, times, seasons and
Diet, and some that are Epileptick before they arrive to the ripeness of Age,
meet with a change.

11. As to the Cure: although the humor to be evacuated, seems to require no
light Medicines, yet by reason of age, I think it better to use them: Therefore
then I shall be content with one simple Medicament: But that being repeated let
him take every other day about an hour before Supper one dose of pil. Ruffi
with pil. Agarick, of which this is the composition.

12. Take the best Aloes, Ammoniacum, of each one ounce: the best Myrrh, half
an ounce: bruise them a part, and then mix all together, with Aromatic Wine
make a paste. Dose one pill the weight of a scruple: let them be taken to at
least two drams, and every other day let him take three spoonfuls of Oxymel
simple.

13. Evacuation being made, the flatuous humors are to be discussed, and the
Ventricle to be strengthened, taking for some days a Confection of Ginger, to
the quantity of a Walnut in the morning with an empty Stomach.

14. Diatrion pipereon Galeni simplex is the best, also before Eating, let his
drink be of Wormwood-wine, in the place of salt add to all his Meat the powder
which is made of Sugar, two ounces: Cinnamon, half an ounce.

15. Let his Legs be rubbed often in a bath made of a Lixivium, in which are
boiled, Marjoram, Wormwood, Roses, Sage, Betony, Rosemary, Lavender, with the
addition of Wine.

16. The Finger from whence that venomous Vapor proceeds must be anointed at
night before sleep, with Treacle dissolved in aqua vitae.

17. It will be a very good praecaution, if before the fit, even while he feels
it a coming, that he use things to bind the parts as either the root of the
Finger, the Ankles and Knee.

18. Great care is to be had of the Head, a Lixivum being often adhibited, in
which are boiled Capital herbs, such as Ditany, the leaves of Sena, Roses,
Sage, Marjoram, Betony.

19. Soap, also is Medicinable, the description whereof, is as follows: Take
Castle-soap, four ounces: white Agarick, two ounces: Cinnamon, Cloves, Orrice,
of each one dram and a half: Camphire, half a scruple: let there be a
sufficient quantity of Soap, with Marjoram water.

20. And always, two days before the use of the lie, let him chew between his
teeth, the bigness of a Bean, of the grains of Mastich, and let him spitout,
about an hour, the phlegm that descends into his Mouth, he may attract the
following Liquor into his Nostrils, whereby they may be cleansed.

21. Take Marjoram-water, three ounces: the powder of Orrice-root, mix them:
sometimes he may use the following Gargarism: Take decoction of Hyssop, one
pound: Vinegar of squils, one ounce, mix them.

22. And for a suffumigation, let him throw white Amber on live Coals of Fire,
or pure Frankincense.

13, On the very top of the Head in the place of the Coronal future, let him
sprinkle at night, before he steeps, the following powder: Take Gum Juniper,
Frankincense, white Amber, of each one dram: Nigella, grains of Peony, Terra
sigillata, of each one dram and half: bruise them and make a subtle Powder.

24. Prepare also a perfumed Pill, to be carried in the Hands and held often to
the Nostrils: Take pure Labdanum, one ounce: styrax Calamitae, half an ounce:
wood of Aloes, Gallia Moschata, Cloves, of each one dram: Myrrh, Frankincense,
of each one dram and half: Marjoram-water, a sufficient quantity: make a Pill,
to which add Musk, five grains.

25. Always anoint the Temples and Nostrils before sleep with Treacle,
dissolved in Aqua Vitae.

26. Now, because the Falling Sickness is a Disease difficult to be cured,
chiefly in that it is accompanied with the pain of the Cholick in this young
man; we shall add present remedies besides these before mentioned, which will
undoubtedly work the Cure.

27. The first Experiment is, let him take, by turns, the Diuretic powder
whereby the whole Body shall be purged and the matter diverted from the Head:
Take Germander, Ground Pine, of each half an ounce: Sage, Betony, of each six
drams: Gentiana, two drams: madder, of each half a dram: seeds of Anniss,
Lovage, Parsley, of each two ounces: being all beaten, make a most subtle
Powder: one dram for a dose in Broth.

28. The vinegar of squils is most wholesome; one great spoonful for a dose
afterward, let him walk: the decoction of sassafras either in water alone, or
in wine, is singularly good; a piece of Aloes is to be carried about, so that
it may touch the skin.

29. The skin of a Wolf is of good use; that part which is near the Back, being
cut in the form of a girdle two Inches broad, gird about the Bowels and Loins,
so that it may touch the skin, the hairy side being outward.

30. As soon as the Foal comes into the light, it casts by Vomit, a certain
kind of matter, which if it be not suddenly snatched up, the dam her self
swallows it: this matter being dried and poudered by certain experience, Cures
the Falling Sickness, which is a wonderful thing indeed.

31. Our common Venice Treacle, is a very proper remedy for this Disease, so as
by that alone many have been cured.

32. There is also a most admirable water and of singular virtues, commonly
called Treacle-water, being Phylosophically prepared, causes plentiful
sweating; and makes a wonderful change in the whole Body for the better, by
virtue of which the Disease is overcome (a description thereof you may see in
the new London Dispensatory, lib. 4. cap. 1. sect. 51. and 52.)

33. Oil of vitriol, taken five drops at a time in the morning fasting for many
days together, has cured many men of this Disease, so also Bones filed and
reduced to a fine powder, adding a small Portion of Cinnamon. The bones best to
be used in this Case, according to Galen, are those of humane kind, and of them
the skull is preferable. Dose one dram in the morning, for many months, it has
no ill taste. Scholzius ex Donzillino, Cons. 38.

LXIX. The Falling Sickness cured by the use of Guajacum.

1. The preparation of this Wood: Take shavings or Raspings of Guajacum one
pound, put them into a Copper diet-pot tin'd over within, or into an Earthen
pot well leaded or Glazed, having a narrow mouth, so large as to hold 16 pounds
more or less. Affuse on this wood, fair water twelve pounds, let it simper over
a gentle fire for twenty four hours: then boil it to the Consumption of one
half, then strain through a Cloth, and reserve it under the name of the first
decoction.

2. The second Decoction. Take the same wood again, put it into the same Diet
pot or Vessel, and add to it four ounces of fresh Wood, on which affuse twelve
pounds or pints of fresh water, Infuse again as before, twenty four hours, and
then boil to the Consumption of one third part, viz. four pints, which strain,
as aforesaid: this reserve under the name of the second or latter Decoction.

3. Before the use of these waters, it is convenient that the Body be purged,
and that at fit times with pil. Cochiae, and pil. de Agarico, with the powder
of Ginger, of each two scruples: which make into five or seven pills, according
as he can swallow them.

4. But for three or four days before the taking of these Pills, the pituitous
and thick humors are to be prepared for the better evacuating of them by
taking every morning Syrups, viz. Honey of Roses, strained, and syrup of
Staechas, of each one ounce: mix with syrup of Germander, three ounces: this
done let the former pills be taken in the night after the first sleep.

5. The time more commodious for purgation is in the spring, when all sorts of
Cures are more easily performed, the Air being purer and warmer; then the
decoction of the wood will have the better operation in order to the Cure of
the Disease.

6. The Quantity of the Decoction to be taken; every other day after purgation,
eight ounces more or less of the first decoction are to be drunk warm, and that
about eight a Clock in the Morning, so much likewise more or less may be drunk
at four a Clock in the Afternoon, let him be in bed when the first decoction is
drunk, and if sweating be designed, let him lie two hour less or more in bed:
it is not to be wondered at, if the sweat presently break not forth, which
always it does after one hour or two; and then to be wiped off with linen
cloths.

7. In the mean time before sweating, it is necessary that you dip a Cloth in
the first Decoction, being warm, and therewith to foment the whole left Leg,
for that the first cause of the Disease seems to lie there, and it is not to be
slightly done, seeing it wonderfully draws forth the evil quality of the parts
affected, and strengthens them, so also let the fomentation be applied to the
whole-face and foreparts of the Head, or let them be washed with the said
Decoction, for the same reason.

8. The use of the second Decoction, This is to be used at meals, to wit, at
dinner and supper, let the bread be white, well baked and a little salted, or
rather twice baked, or he may use Biscuit which is commendable.

9. Raisons of the sun are good food, but rather blew Currants, with Almonds
and Pinenuts blanched; and as to flesh he may eat Birds of mountainous and
woody places, as Pheasants, Patriges, Thrushes: Sparrows are a specific in
this Case, and are all of them to be roasted, not excluding Chickens and Capons
and Kids flesh, which ought also to be roasted, and to be Eaten with the said
second Decoction.

10. If he goes not well to stool, he must have a Clyster, made of the
Decoction of the wood, Oil Olive and a little Salt, or instead thereof, two or
three ounces of honey of Roses: then he is to purge with the pills before
prescribed, unless necessity requires other Physic: the Pills are to be taken
at midnight, or after the first sleep, and the first Decoction to be omitted in
the morning.

11. But if the body be rendered weaker by purging, yet let nothing be omitted,
moreover the Decoctions of the wood may be used for a month at least, observing
the diet now prescribed.

12. Instead of wine and other strong liquors, he may use a small kind of Mead,
wherein choice Cinnamon has been Infused. But at least the Body is to endure a
Course of purging, spring and fall, with the preparatives of honey of Roses,
syrups of Staechas and of Germander aforesaid; the purges then mentioned being
pil. Cochiae and pil. de Agarico.

13. After the taking of these things, the pulp of Cassia newly extracted may
be taken in form of a Bolus, or dissolved in Chicken-broth or other liquor he
likes best.

14. Also here are not to be rejected pil. Aloephanginae, which may be often
taken; all these things are very commodious, as I have above said, for the
purging both of the Stomach and Bowels: if also the Belly be too much bound, I
do advise the taking of a gentle and easy Clyster, the eating of herbs and
prunes is to be rejected because they are too moist and excrementitious.

15. Of all these which are to be taken inwardly and applied outwardly for
strengthening of the Stomach, I might write a large Catalogue, but a few of the
best will suffice, as chiefly Myrobalans Emblick, preserved or candied, they
may be taken frequently, the morning is the best time an hour before Eating; I
am against Nutmegs prepared after the like manner.

16. Sometimes in the morning you may take an Electuary of Aromaticum Rosatum:
if a plaster be needful, make it of the Oil of Mastich and Orrice, the washing
of the Head is commendable, provided it be before Eating, and the person keep
at home for some time thereafter, and the Head be well dried with warm Cloths,
which may be done with a Lixvium fit for this purpose, impregnated with
Staechas, Sage, Marjoram and Roses, by boiling: rubbing the Head in the mean
time with a piece of Agarick.

17. After the purgation of the Body, you may draw the phlegm from the Head by
the Nostrils, with Orange-peels, also it will be convenient to chew Mastick to
draw away the phlegmatic humor by the palate.

18. There ought to be an Issue made on the Leg, by an Actual Cauterie, below
the knee toward the outward part; if he be not willing to have this done, let
Cupping-glasses be applied to the same place, sometimes with and sometimes
without scarification.

19. It may also be washed with a strong and sharp Lixivium, in which flowers
of Sulphur are boiled, rubbing all the while the Leg exceeding well.

20. This done, apply to the said Leg Emplastrum Oxycroceum, with which so much
Euphorbium must be mixed as may raise on the skin little Blisters. Scholzius,
ex Versalio Cons. 40.

LXX. A Falling Sickness happening in the Night.

1. There is no doubt of the rarity or thinness of the part; it follows
therefore that we give somewhat that has a tendency to the Condensation
thereof; such is washing of the Head, which if it be with hot things, you must
use afterward that which is extreme Cold, thereby the Brain shall be much
strengthened.

2. In your Lixivium boil Southern-wood, Rue, Balm, and Roses, with your Soap
mix yellow Sanders and a little Oil of Cloves.

3. In my Judgment the following Medicament, is excellent: Take juyces of
Yarrow, of Rue, of Bawm, of Marjoram, of Hyssop, boiled to a thickness with
Sugar, of each one ounce and half: roots of Eryngo cut small, wood of Missletoe
of the Oak, of each one ounce: roots of Pyrethrum, powder of Tormentil, of each
an ounce: Hartshorn levigated, six drams: old Venice Treacle, old Mithridate,
of each one ounce: Conserve of Rosemary-flowers, one ounce and half: mix them
over a gentle fire for an Electuary against the Falling Sickness, of this let
him take every day in the morning one dram; and after supper at going to Bed
half a dram.

4. But the Brain ought to be purged with this following Apophlegmatism, take
roots of Pyrethrum, one ounce and half: Ginger, half an ounce: Rosemary, Sage,
Hyssop, Rue, of each one pugil. boil them in a sufficient quantity of fair
water, strain and to a quart thereof put sharp-Vinegar of Roses, two ounces:
mix them: Before that you gargle and hold it in your Mouth, anoint the palate
with the following Lohoch: Take Rocket seed two drams: Stavesacre, Cubebs, of
each two scruples: roots of Pyrethrum, Ginger, of each four scruples: Mastich,
one scruple: Pepper, half a scruple: with Oxymel a sufficient quantity, make a
Lohoch.

5. Nothing is more convenient than a Seton to be applied to the nape of the
Neck, or in place thereof a very strong Lixivium made of Ashes which may
Exulcerate, also to the hinder part of the Head may be applied Cupping-glasses.

6. Trallianus promises a Cure, by the use of these pills which are made of
Aloes, gum Arabic, Colocynthis, Bdellium, of each equal parts, mixed with the
Honey of squills: you will do well to make a Decoction of the bark of Guajacum,
with the wood of Missleto of the Oak.

7. After the Body is evacuated, spring, summer and fall, a decoction of
Succory roots may be used for a while: in the winter time use Mithridate, with
syrup of the juice of Carduus; I like also well the distilled liquour of
Carduus and yarrow, to be taken for a whole year together with the syrup of
Violets; in that liquor you may boil Guajacum with wood of Missletoe of the
Oak, and drink thereof Spring and Fall for forty days together.

8. Empericks use peacocks dung distilled with Carduus and yarrow, which I
highly approve of: the Livers of Frogs and Partridges dried to a powder is
commended by many: let the Belly round about the Navel be anointed with the fat
of a wild Cat: the Head may be purged with the powder of a stone found in a
Bulls gall, snuft up the Nostrills, either by it self or put up by the juice or
Rue, the hinder part of the Neck, anoint with the oil distilled from the wood
of Juniper.

9. But I have found nothing more powerful then Carduus and Yarrow, It is most
convenient to use these and the other things which rightly applied, you may
hope for a Cure through the Divine goodness. Scholzius, ex Cratone Consil. 42.

LXXI. The advice of Rondeletius, for the Falling Sickness.

1. Take Diapruna Laxitiva, three ounces with a sufficient quantity of Betony,
make a Potion, to be given in the morning.

2. Take Missletoe of the Oak, roots of Peony, Worm-seed, of each one ounce:
the Bark of Citrons, half an ounce: Betony, Clary, Succory, Endive, Bugloss,
Borrage, of each one handful: Damsons, to the number of twenty pair: Tamarinds,
one ounce: Agarick, half an ounce: Polypody of the Oak, Sena the best, of each
two ounces: the three Cordial flowers, Staechas, of each one pugil: fresh
Roses, two pugils: Anis, bastard Lovage, of each half an ounce: make a
decoction in Wormwood, and Fountain water, of each a like, two pounds: strain
it, dissolve therein a sufficient quantity of Sugar, and make thereof a Syrup,
and take it every morning.

3. Open the Cephalic Vein and draw forth four ounces of Blood.

4. Take pil. Cochiae, Faetidae, of each half a dram: the powder of the roots
of Peony, six grains: (or rather a scruple) with the syrup of Staechas, make
seven pills.

5. After this the following potion is to be taken: Take Agarick, Rhubarb, of
each two drams: Infuse them in Violet water, strain them and add Electuary of
the juice of Roses, and Diacarthamum, of each one dram and a half: syrup of
Roses laxative, half an ounce: mix them and make a potion.

6. Take when the syrups are done, fresh Treacle, one dram: and afterward the
folloing Opiate: Take Conserves of the flowers of Succory, Violets, of each one
ounce: Staechas, half an ounce: the ashes of a Weasil and Swallows, of each
half a ounce: powder of Diarrhodon abbatis, two drams: with the syrup of simple
Endive make an opiat: let him take every morning the quantity of one Chestnut,
about five hours before meat.

7. The following Oxyrrhodium, will also do good: Take Oil of Roses, three
ounces: the juice of Ivy, Lettice water, of each one ounce: Vinegar, one ounce
and a half: dip the Head into it before the opposition and conjunction of the
Moon. Scholzius ex Rondeletio, Cons. 39.

LXXII. Another Falling Sickness happening in the Night.

1. Care must be had that such Meats and Drinks be not used as do swell up the
Stomach with wind, stretch it out and oppress it, you must also know what meats
are agreeable to the Stomach, which not.

2. For it happens that one sort of meat may be pleasant to many men, which may
be hurtful to another man; and is discernable by this, that it so pains, and
gnaws as it were the mouth of the Stomach, that some Anxiety thereupon follows.

3. He should so lay himself in Bed as that his Head be somewhat high, and let
him cover it so, as that it may not be too hot or cold.

4. It will be convenient to wash his Feet often in hot water about the
Evening, yet so as that the steam of the water be not drawn up into the Brain
by his Nostrills, but before washing, he should use frictions of the Thighs
with warm Clothes, till they are made warm, and the skin begin to grow red.

5. The belly ought to be kept in a good habit, for according to the temper the
Belly is in, the Paroxysms come oftener or seldomer.

6. The Vein of the Ankle is to be cut, it has done so much good as many
thereby has been freed from the Invasions of the fits.

7. He would do well to use frequently, syrup of sweet Apples, beginning at two
ounces and so proceeding, if that does not purge, to three ounces or three or
three and a half, and the most four ounces.

8. It being mixed either with water or wine, is to be taken half an hour after
dinner, or if he have a mind to take it more early, let it be five hours before
dinner.

9. Presently after the taking of the syrup you may either eat a boiled Apple
or a soft Egg, or sugar of Roses, or such like.

10. Moreover he may take in place of this a syrup made of the flowers of
Peaches and of Prunes, this is also to be added, to wit, that with every dose
there be mixed the roots of Peony, and the grains thereof hul'd, of each half a
dram.

11. Also in place of the syrups, he may use the pills below described, and the
Confection of Diaturbith with Agarick prepared, as it is in the Dispensatory:
the dose is half an ounce.

12. He may use the Confection Diacitri, made into Lozenges, weighing five
drams a piece.

13. Also Agarick, Turbith, Mechoacan, Sena, what quantity you please may be
infused in strong-water for twenty four hours, in a warm place Close stopped,
after which you may strain it by pressing; in this strained liquor you may
Infuse either Figgs, Prunes or Raisons, till they have dissipated their
sweetness into the liquor, and the fruit themselves are thoroughly imbibed.

14. Being overspread with sugar and dried, they are to be eaten before meals,
so many as may give two or three stools.

15. These are the purging Medicines, which for five or six days, or ten or
twelve days, etc. are to be often repeated according to the Circumstance of
time and place, for in these things consists principally the reason of the Cure.

16. Others things are to be added, as waters, Pouders, Oils, raising of
Blisters, and lastly, if need require, Cauteries.

17. He may take one spoonful, or at most two of these waters every morning,
with two Rowls of the Confection, either with or without Castoreum; and that
the first day after the new moon, or full moon, or the two quarters of the moon.

18. And when he fears the falling into a fit, it will be convenient to take
these waters in the Evening, chiefly in the winter season, or when he has supped
sparingly.

19. A water made of Swallows is also good, he may make his choice of any one
of all these: as to the powder, he may take thereof one dram, or a dram and a
half, or at most two drams, in the morning two or three hours before Meat.

20. But this is to be done on those days, wherein he takes none of the
aforesaid waters, and purging Medicines.

21. Also the body is to be purged Spring and Fall, and sometimes the vein on
the Ankle is to be opened, as is above directed.

22. After the Autumnal purgation, it will be profitable to apply Vesicatories
to the nape of the Neck, near the Shoulders, and afterward to open the Bladder
that the water may Issue out for some days, till at last it stops of its own
accord.

23. The Bladder being anointed with fresh Butter, is to be morning and
evening, covered with a Colewort leaf.

24. Anoint also the Coronal future, with some drops of the oil of Rue, when
the fit is feared and exspected, or proves very troublesome to the person.

25. It will be Convenient to drop into both the Ears some drops of the same
oil warm, and to stop them with Cotton least the Air should penetrate them,
this being done wash them in the morning with warm wine, in which is boiled,
Mint, Rue and the roots of Peony.

26. Let him use always Pomanders, but chiefly in winter, when it is Cloudy
and Rainy weather, in summer he may use, Roses, Quinces, and other fragrant
fruits and flowers.

27. Last of all he may Eat instead of the aforesaid powder, the fourth part of
a Nutmeg, also with the part of the powder mix Conserve of the flowers of
Betony or Peony, or sweet Mullyen, or the flowers or Rosemary, or Cloves, all
these Conserves taken alone are very good as also Confected Myrobalans.

28. Here does follow some of the Medicines, which I have already mentioned:
Take species Aromaticae Caryophillatae, species Diamoschu Dulcis, seeds of
Peony hull'd, roots of Peony, of each one dram: Cinnamon, Galangal, Cloves,
Mace, wood of Aloes, of each one scruple: seeds of Annise and Fennel, of each a
scruple and half: sugar of Roses Tabulated, six ounces: mix and make a Tragea,
or compound powder.

29. Take Rosemary, Marjoram, of each one pugil: Orange or Citron peels, two
drams: seeds of Peony huld, one dram: Wood of Aloes poudered, one dram and
half: boil them in your broth, made of flesh.

30. Take syrup of juice of Citrons, syrup of Mint, of each five drams: mix
them.

31. Take species Aromaticae Caryophyllatae, two drams: roots of Peony, seeds
of the same hul'd, of each a dram and half: Cinnamon, Ginger, Cloves, of each
one dram and half: Wood of Aloes, two scruples: sugar of Roses tabulated, or in
Lozenges, five ounces: mix and make a powder.

32. Take Chemical Oil of Rue, seven drops: Chemical Oil of Motherwort, three
drops: of Orrice, of Earthworms, of each one dram: mix them.

33. Take Mechoacan one dram: Gummy Turbith, half a dram: Diagrydium, three
grains: Mace, Spicknard, of each three grains: mix them for two doses.

34. Take Sena, half an ounce: Turbeth, Mechoacan, of each three drams:
Rhubarb, two drams: Spurge, fifteen grains: Raisons of the sun, half an ounce:
Cinnamon, Ginger, of each two scruples: roots of Peony, a dram and half: bruise
all of them, and macerate them in a sufficient quantity of Hyssop water, for a
quarter of an hour, after make an infusion upon hot Embers close covered: being
finished, strain it strongly out by pressing.

35. Take of this water, as you please, or three ounces: syrup of Apples, four
ounces: mix them and boil gently to the Consumption of the water.

36. Take of the aforesaid Decoction or Infusion what you think good; cut
raisons always asunder, and put them into it, digest them so long till their
whole bodies are thoroughly imbibed with the liquor, then dry them in the
shadow; being almost dried, strew them over with a powder made of Cinnamon and
Sugar. Erastus apud Scholtzium, Cons. 43.

LXXIII. Epileptick remedies, out of the Epistles collected by Laurentius
Scholzius.

1. Caesar's secret against the Falling Sickness, He held the following
Compositum for a great Secret: confirmed also by Dr. Peter Cavizerum an aged
Physician, that being given after purging, it sails not to Cure: Take
Crystialls prepared, one dram: red Coral prepared, two scruples: Oriental
pearls prepared, one scruple: Oriental emeralds prepared, half a dram: mix and
make a powder: Of which the half part is a dose, given in Dandelion water.

2. Crato, the Author of the Epistle, says, That he twice tried this remedy
against the Falling Sickness, and it cured both times, but he said they died
afterward, For he questiones the safety of the powder of Crystal; and the true
Emerald is difficult to be had, for that which is sold to us, for the Emerald
is nothing else (says he) but Lapis de Peru, viz. a fragment of the great
stone Prasius, Scholzij, Epist. Medit. 121.

3. This is the opinion you see of Crato, but I am apt to believe that if
Crystal is well levigated, and made impalpable, or perfectly fine and soft,
there is no such danger in it, as that Learned man does stand in fear of: For
all the hurt of that stone is in the largness of its particles, lest they
should prick or velicate the Stomach and Bowels, which being made so perfectly
soft, there is not the least fear of.

4. Crato in his Epistle to Jordan. If it be by consent from the Stomach, it
causes a Convulsion. If it be from the Womb, the reason may otherwise be
considered. But nothing is more convenient than the use of Agarick: Then of
Treacle, and the Bath waters: also pessaries of Mithridate, may be put up the
Womb.

5. To these I add, Pills made of Aloes Rosata, Myrrh and Amber, which
wonderfully recreate and strengthens the Stomach and Womb.

6. Also syrup of the juice of Carduus benedictus; and extract of Calamus
Aromaticus, which I have experienced to be of Wonderful use in the
Falling Sickness.

7. So also Hartshorn prepared, to be continually taken in drink; this
Medicament, says Crato, is by no means to be neglected. Scholzij, Epist. Medic.
150.

8. Crato to the same Man. If he has the Falling Sickness, let his drink be a
decoction of Guajacum, with wood of Missletoe of the Oak; by the use of which I
have found much profit. Scholzij, Epist. Medic. 158.

9. Crato to the same man. Against this Herculean disease, I commend to them
the livers of Patridges and Frogs gently dried, and poudred, to be given in
Yarrow water: The latter of which, viz. of Frogs is accounted a divine remedy,
and second to none.

10. The true Mummy is profitable, being taken from dead Bodies embalmed with
Frankincense, Myrrh and Aloes.

11. Hearts horn, and Oil of Vitriol, he gives experimental commendations of, in
the Cure of this Disease.

12. The Epileptick Emplaster of Franciscus Valesius, which being applied to
the Coronal sutures, is said, never to fail of the Cure, and by those who have
practiced with the same for thirty years together: Take white Amber,
Frankincense, Mastich, of each a dram and half: Galbanum, Opopanax, of each a
scruple: Missletoe of the Oak, two drams: Ambergrise, six grains: Musk, three
grains: seed of the male Peony, half a dram: Labdanum, a dram and half: Oil of
Nutmegs a little: mix and make an Emplaster according to Art, strewing in also
some powder of Cubebs: when you use it spread it upon Leather. Scholzij, Epist.
Medic. 161.

LXXIV. A Falling Sickness, in a Woman by consent from the Stomach, happening
suddenly by reason of the wonderful plenitude of the whole Body, but
especially of the Brain, was happily cured within the space of two days.

1. Galen says, that the Falling sickness being a Convulsion of all the parts
of the Body, which is not perpetual but returns at some certain intervalls;
consisting in the Brain or some other part affected, the humor stopping the
passage of the Animal spirits, which are contained in the Ventricles of the
Brain, whereby follows such a Concussion of the Nerves as forcibly to expel
that which is held in the ventricles, or what is delated there from any other
part; must needs do great hurt.

2. Those who are troubled with this disease, you may perceive not only to be
afflicted with a Convulsion of the whole Body, but also with such a deprivation
of the functions of the external Senses as that they cannot see, hear, nor
speak.

3. Their looks are stern, their Eyes and Mouth drawn awry and they snort while
they Breath; and the reason why they make this noise when they breath, is
because there is no passage for the Breath through the narrow and inequal
places which are filled with phlegm.

4. The Trachea Arteria, to wit, near the Larynx being filled with the gross
humor, there must needs be a snorting kind of noise especially if the humor
abound, and the place be narrow, by which the Breath should pass.

5. Another reason is when the pituitous humor descending from the Brain,
contained in a hollow place, with which the Breath is mixed and by expiration
is emitted, causes such an agitation of the humor (the native heat which is
the Vehicle of all the powers assisting) as that in the act of breathing, there
appears a great noise, which grows greater and greater according to the
accession and force of the humor.

6. If according to Galen, snorting be an Indication of an Apoplexy, how more
justly may we referr it to be an indication of the Epilepsy.

7. This snorting (which is nothing else but a sounding Breath emitted and
received into the Aspera Arteria) is deducible from two Causes, as first, from
some thick gross humor or dark vapor which obstructs the Breath, of which
kind of distemper Plinius Nepos relates that Plinius Veronensis died.

8. And it was occasioned thus, the latter going up to the Mountain Vesuvius to
look on a prodigious flaming Cloud, his breath was obstructed by a gross dark
vapor; by reason of the narrowness of the passage, and his great snorting he
could not draw his Breath, and so died.

9. Lastly, it proceeds from the too great siccity or dryness of the Aspera
Arteria, or the want of strength, as is discernable in those that are near
death, or in those that are Peripneumonick or Pleuretick, or in those that are
troubled with acute Fevers, so much concerning snorting, which happens in the
disease of the Falling Sickness.

10. Now by these Accessions, the mind and the internal senses are for the
most part hurt, it is evident also, That the Brain being hurt, and its
Ventricle being obstructed, there follows an obstruction of all its actions;
according to Galen.

11. What wonder is it then, if the Animal spirit, which sit as Ruler of both
senses and motion, be viciated, and all the Internal and External senses be
hurt? and this is certainly the cause why the Reason, Cogitation and Memory in
those that are taken with the Falling Sickness do not proceed regularly.

12. For the faculty of the Brain and its Instrument, the Animal spirit being
possessed of of the Disease, and being intent and earnest to overcome it, is
rendered less able to perform its several functions and offices.

23. A wonderful weariness and weakness redounds from the Accession of this
humor, which happens upon this Account, because Nature in this great Contest
labors to be rid of so hurtful a Distemper, by which battle there is a great
resolution, both of the native heat and the spirits, from whence they become
pale, weak, and dejected.

14. And this Accession in the sick person proceeds rather by consent from the
Ventricle and Belly filled with much phlegm, than the property and and
primogenious affection of the Brain: as the manner, reason and celerity of the
Cure.

15. Where the Evil comes from the primogenious affection of the Brain, chiefly
in declining Age, either never or in a long tract of time that affection is
wont to be cured.

16. According to Hypocrates's, mind those that have the Falling Sickness,
before the ripeness of Age, meet with an alteration: but if the Disease trouble
till the twenty fifth year, the sick dies.

17. A great and habitual hurt is indicated in the principal part, where the
affection continues so long that either it is with great difficulty, or not at
all cured.

18. Why about the end of the Accession there appears much spume or froth in
the mouth, there is this reason for it.

19. The matter contained in the Brain, obstructing the Ventricle, falling
down, is carried by that pipe to the mouth, which ending on the palate from the
middle Ventricle of the Brain, derives its Excrements.

20. It is called (...) vel (...) in Greek, Infundibulum in Latin; Colatorium
among Anatomists.

21. The matter being detruded from this part, and mixed to the spirituous
substance, makes a spume or Froth, for indeed according to Galen; all spume
proceeds from the mixture of two substances, one spirituous, and the other
moist.

22. The mixture of these is thus, both of them are broken and divided into
many; and those procreate little small bubbles, the violent motion either of
both, or of one makes the mixture sometimes of the frothy substance with the
watery, as also a strong heat, as is experienced in the sea that is moved with
the winds, which, according to the Impetuosity of the motion, it is more or
less furious and frothy.

23. Now because the Disease is fierce and sharp and is accompanied with many
bad symptoms, by which it is feared the sick person may fall into an Apoplexy:
not only because of the plenty of the matter filling the Ventricles of the
Brain, but also the greatness and duration of the Epileptick fits, (for she
continued almost a day in one perpetual fit or Accesion).

24. She must be helped according to Hippocrates, in one day, if the Disease be
Acute, procrastination, in such is, Dangerous.

25. Therefore we count it best to bring back the matter again from the
principal part and to Expurgate the same; the Head is to be strengthened and
the sick relieved by Efficacious and opportune Remedies.

26. Also the humor is to be carried down to the inferior parts, by a smart
Clyster, and the Cephalic vein is to be opened; and because the matter did
swell by a vehement obstruction and had possessed the Brain; we must succor
the principal part.

27. The description of the Clyster is as follows: Take the four Emollitives
(for the Belly was constipated when she was taken with the Epilepsy) of each a
handful: Hyssop, Betony, sweet Marjoram, Bawm, Centaury the lesser, of each
half a handful: the seeds of Annise, of Dill, of Fennel, and of Rue, of each
three drams: the flowers of Chamomil, of Rosemary, of Staechas, and of Elder,
of each one pugil: Agarick, tied in a thin linen Cloth, three drams: Polypody
of the Oak beaten, one ounce: course Bran, two pugils: make a decoction to one
pound, and strain it. In the strained liquor dissolve Hiera Galeni, one ounce:
the Electuarium Indi, Majoris, three drams: honey of Violets, honey of Rosemary
flowers, of each two ounces: sal gem one dram: Oil of Lillies, three ounces:
mix them and make a Clyster.

28. A great abundance of pituitous and flatuous Excrements were evacuated by
this Clyster; and the Belly being emptied: we commanded Blood to be taken away,
not only because of the greatness of the present bad disposition the patient
was in, but to prevent an imminent danger.

29. For there was at once a most grieous fit and the fear of an Apoplexy;
wherefore finding her to be of a succulent good habit of Body, we thought
letting of Blood was convenient, according to the opinion of Hippocrates, who
says that in acute Diseases or affections, if the sickness be vehement, and
the Infirm person be in their flourishing age, and strong withal, it will not
be amiss to draw a little Blood out of the Chephalick vein.

30. And having taken also some Blood out of the middle Vein, the fit
immediately after became lighter; which being done, least the humor in the
principal part should swell and increase, we ordered the following potion to be
taken the next morning after.

31. Take Hiera Galeni, half an ounce: Diaphaenicon, Electuarium, Indi Majoris,
of each one dram: Agarick trochiscated infused and expressed in Oxymel of
squills, four drams: Oxymel of squills, one ounce: and a sufficient quantity,
of the water of the decoction of Betony, and Hyssop with the Cordial
flowflowers, mix them: upon which there happened the evacuation of much phlegm
and water.

32. On the day following we gave her an Antidote, Venice Treacle and
Mithridate, with the Conserve of the flowers of Rosemary and Staechas, in
Sugar, a Bolus being made; which, because she could not swallow, it was
administered by way of potion, in a decoction of Hyssop and Bawm.

33. We did not forget the fit, for we used frictions, the rubing of the
members and especially the extreme parts, shoutings and noise, besides what we
thought fit to apply to the Nostrils and put into the Mouth: fresh Rue, bruised
and macerated in Vinegar, we put up in the Nostrils; and we did put into her
mouth and did rub the Palate sometimes with Rue, sometimes with Castoreum.

34. Long and daily experience has convinced me of the usefullness of the
juice of Rue with the honey of squills, in order to relieve persons in such
kind of fits; for this person having taken of it but twice, she was no more
afflicted with fits, the humor being discussed by the virtue and calidity of
the aforesaid Rue.

35. I have found the like effects of it, in Children new born who were
troubled with this disease.

36. Now whereas this affection proceeds from the fault of the Stomach, we
conceive that a Vomit in this cause will be very profitable; which is to be
thus made, as we have tried it, mix Oxymel in the decoction of Raddish and
Orache seeds: having dipped a feather in Oil, caused a great abundance of
pituitous matter to flow out of her Mouth.

37. And, that she might not relapse into these fits, we prescribed, by way of
prevention, the following Medicine: Take Catholicon, six drams: Diaphaenicon,
two drams: make with sugar a Bolus.

38. The day after she began to take the following Apozem for the Head, six
days together: Take Acorus, the roots of Elicampane and sea Peony, of each one
ounce: Cyprus, Calamus Aromaticus, of each half an ounce: dry Citron Bark,
Misletoe of the Oak, of each six drams: Bawm, mountain Hyssop, Betony, sweet
Marjoram, Rue, of each one handful: common Maiden hair, half an handful: the
herb Mercury, as much: gout Ivy, Primrose (these two are for the Gout with
which this person was afflicted) of each half an handful: the flowers of
Carthamus seeds, two ounces: Agarick trochiscated, tied in a thin linen Cloth,
one ounce: Anniss and Fennil seeds, of each two drams: Peony seeds, gathered in
the decrease of the moon, half an ounce: Melons seeds with the hulls bruised,
three drams: the flowers of Rosemary and staechas, of each one pugil: the
flowers of Bugloss and Broom, of each two pugil: Epithymum, half an ounce: make
a decoction of them all, in two pound of fountain water, and strain it: add to
the strained liquor, Oxymel of squills, four ounces: honey of Roses strained,
fresh syrup of Betony, of each two ounces: mix them and make an Apozem
clarified and aromatized with Nutmeg, the powder of the species diamoschi
dulcis, of each one dram: for two doses, which repeat twice.

39. The syrup being done, we prescribed this potion: Take of the decoction of
the abovesaid Apozem, four ounces: add white Agarick with a little Ginger
infused, four scruples: Diaphaenicon, Electuary of Citrons solutive, of each
one dram and a half: syrup of Roses from the Infusion of Roses with scammony,
two ounces: mix them and make a potion, and let them be given in due order.

40. Take Conserves of Roses and Rosemary flowers, of each one dram: old
Treacle, two drams: make a Bolus thereof in the whitest sugar: which let her
take as a daily Medicine five hours before Meat.

41. Take the Conserves of Acorus strained, one ounce: the Conserves of the
flowers of Rosemary, staechas and Bugloss, of each one ounce: Conserves of the
flowers of Sage and Succory, of each half an ounce: Emblick Myrobalans candied,
one in number: the powder of the species Diamoschi Dulcis, one dram and a half:
candied Citrons peels, half an ounce: Peony seeds, gathered in their proper
season, missletoe of the Oak, of each one dram and a half: the powder of man's
skull, five scruples: the powder of red Coral washed, and the raspings of
Jvory, of each one dram: the powder of Nutmeg and the sharpest biting Cinnamon,
of each two scruples: mix them with the syrup of the Conserves of Acorus and
the honey of squills: make it after the manner of an Opiate; when done, take
every other morning to the bigness of a Chestnut, thereof washing the Mouth with
a little wine, mixed with some Bugloss-water.

42. Afterward let the person sleep and abstain from meat four hours.

43. When she had taken this Medicine, she found her self much released from
her Disease, moreover, for diverting the matter from the Brain and Ventricle,
we prescribed pills to be taken.

44. Take pil. Assajeret, two drams: Aloes, thrice washed in the juice of
Hyssop, three drams: Agarick trochiscated, two drams: pil. Cochiae, two drams:
Mastich, Nutmeg, the powder of Man's skull, Peony seeds, of each one scruple:
Troches Alhandal, five grains: mix them and make a past with the honey of
squill, out of a dram of which make six pills.

45. Let her take once in a month four scruples, and sometimes three pills,
weighing half a dram, and after a light supper, let her go to sleep.

46. But least vapors after meat should seize her Head, for the repression of
them, we ordered her to take the following powder.

47. Take Coriander and Mastich prepared, of each one ounce: Aniss also
prepared, one ounce: the seed of Myrtle-berries, two drams: Pulvis Diacidonium
without the species, three drams: choice Cinnamon, two drams: the powder of red
Coral washed and choice Pearl, of each one dram and half: the Raspings of
Ivory, one dram: sugar of Roses tabulated, a double weight of all the
Medicines, mix them and make a powder, which she is to use when she has done
eating, but without drinking after it.

48. This person was so well recovered and restored to perfect Health, that she
relapsed no more into this dangerous Disease. Ex Francisci Valleriolae, lib. 3.
Observe. 7.

LXXV. A certain Noble Woman, after difficult Labor or Travel in
Childbearing, fell suddenly into fits of the Epilepsy.

1. When the time of Travel came upon this Gentlewoman, most grievious pains
siezed her, and the Child in her belly being of a very great weight, and large
Head, she endured a very painful Labor.

2. There happened thereupon, together with her straining endeavors to bring
forth, that the Mouth of the Vessels being thereby too much opened, such a vast
profusion of Blood, as that her strength was almost utterly wasted, and her
danger so great, as that she was even ready to expire.

3. At last by the goodness of God, the Infant came forth, and the profusion of
blood stopped, but she began to fall into an Epileptick fit, which was
accompanied with a deprivation and loss of Wit, and the hurt of all the
internal and external Senses.

4. Her Mouth was also full of froth, her Eyes were staring and pulled awry,
and a snorting wheasing noise was perceived in the Jaws, all which did foretell
the coming of an astonishing Disease.

5. These fits did not come once in a day, and gently but within a few
intervals of some hours and fiercely, so that through the grieviousness and
frequency of them, together with the complication of other contrary affections
and symptoms, she was in great danger of Death.

6. But what we must do in these kinds of repugnant and contrary Diseases,
Galen tells us, that the Disease which is most urgent, to it we should direct
our Counsel, and apply our Cures.

7. When I had perceived a great Corruption of the humors, with the imbecility
of Nature, and contrary Indications fighting one against another, my advice
was, that seeing these Indications were so adverse to each other, the vicious
and noxious humor was to be evacuated, and what was good and wholesome to be put
in the place thereof.

8. We shall now in order to a Cure, regard that Symptom, from which no small
danger did accrue to this person, viz. the too great loss of Blood, weakening
and almost destroying Nature, neither shall we pass by the accession of the
Fit, both which is according to Galens Mind.

9. We stopped this great profusion of Blood by applying Ligatures to the
superior parts and Cupping-glasses under the Breasts, according to
Hippocrates, as also astringent Potions, and Fomentations and Bathings of her
Privy parts, and likewise by injecting Clysters into the Belly. This method was
observed by us.

10. Take Boodstone, four scruples: the powder of fine Bole, red Coral,
Pearl, of each one dram: seeds of Plantane, Coriander prepared, the seeds of
Sumach-berry, of each two scruples: mix them and make a subtle powder, of which
I ordered a dram and sometimes half a dram, with the Decoction of Knot-grass
and the Syrup of Quinces.

11. Those things which are for the affects of the Womb, may be given in a
larger Dose, because of the situation and distance of the parts.

12. I also used Pastils, Troches or Cakes of Amber: but when those were not
sufficient to stop the flux, I gave Philonum Persicum rightly prepared with
juice of Plantane; than which there is no greater nor more present help, in all
effusions of Blood, that ever I could meet with.

13. For it inclines to Sleep, shuts up the Mouths of the Vessels; and thickens
the blood, by which intentions the bleeding is stopped.

14. I used also the following fomentation: Take tops of the Lentisk of
Brambles, leaves of Plantane of Cypress, of Olives, of Bloodwort, of
Knot-grass, of each one handful: red Roses, two pugils: Myrtle-berries, one
ounce: Cypress-nuts beaten, number six: Nut-galls, as many: Pomgranate-peels,
two pugils: make of all a Decoction in steeled Water, and thick red Wine: with
which foment the part affected, viz. about the Region of the Womb.

15. Afterward anoint the same with Vnguentum Comitissae with juice of
Plantane; it is a most effectual thing in easing pain and stopping blood.

16. I also (by the example of Galen) injected the juice of Plantane into the
Womb, from which she had wonderful help.

17. In the mean season (whilst I was not wanting to take away the Epileptick
fits) there was a new accession; and although all things was not so exactly
performed which the thing required, yet to the above described Potion, I added
seeds and roots of Peony, Misleto of the Oak, and a small quantity of the
Species Diamoschi Dulcis.

18. I ordered also to the Nostrils (as an Errhine) the juice of Rue pressed
out with Vinegar, put Castoreum into her Mouth, caused a mighty Noise to be
made, to pull her Hair, with several other things till she was recovered out of
the fit.

19. Neither here is evacuation at all designed, for weak Powers will not admit
of evacuation although the matter may, which breeds the frequent accessions of
the Fits.

20. And since of all Indications, the first and chief are to be derived from
the Powers, according to Galen; a great care must be had that we strengthen and
refect these weak and faint Powers; for which end evacuation cannot be a proper
mean.

21. These Powers are strengthened (as Galen says) by exhibiting things likest
to those which the Powers consist of; for the Custody of the Powers does
Indicate the exhibition of things which were alike.

22. The substance of those Powers are supplied by the Breath, as also by the
fleshly or carnous Species and by things that are firm and solid.

23. I endeavored diligently to renew and repair the Spirit or Breath by
respiration and transpiration; the solid kind by solid Nutriment; the carnous
or fleshy kind, by these things that are in a Medium betwixt humid and solid
Bodies.

24. I did nourish the Breath with a refrigerating and pleasant Air, and
because it was Summer, I ordered her Windows to be opened for the Air to come
in, and her Chamber to be spread over with Roses and Myrtle leaves, Oranges and
Limons, and the floar to be sprinkled with the Vinegar of Roses, that she might
smell nothing but fragrant Odours.

25. There are a kind of superstitious Physicians, who will not permit any Air
to come into the Room where the Sick is, nor suffer the Windows at any time to
be opened; by which means the Air within being shut up, and the sick person's
breath being mixed therewith, is infected with a putrid quality, and so the sick
breathing therein is extremely prejudiced.

26. I endeavored to renew and strengthen the Members which were solid with
solid Nutriment, and of an easy Concoction, such as Broths made of Partridges
and Capons, also the extracted juice of Flesh, especially such as are roasted
at the fire, the juice being taken out by pricking it with a sharp pointed
Knife, and afterward the remaining juice is to be pressed out and then
swallowed.

27. I cannot indeed mention any juice, that is better and more effectual than
that of a Weathers Heart, for repairing these weakened Powers; the Heart above
all parts of the living Creature, consists of more solid Flesh, how much more
firm and solid the part is from whence the juice comes; so much the more force
and virtue it has to recover weakened Powers and decayed strength.

28. Moreover experience teaches, seeing every Member has somewhat that bears a
resemblance of it self by a certain kind of Sympathy and tacit consent of
Nature, it follows that the juice extracted from the Heart does by an
undiscernable property greatly help and strengthen the Heart of Man.

29. The method to be used in extracting this juice is thus, take either the
Heart of a Weather or Kid, cut it in the middle and wash it well in water that
none of the blood and the filth may remain, then while its warm, put it into
Rose Water, and being cut in pretty long bits, put it without Liquor in a
Earthen Vessel glazed, with some Gloves, and the Vessel being well covered with
Paste or Clay, put it into a hot Oven, when it is dissolved into a juice, take
it out, and give it to the Sick.

30. A broth made also of the Yolks of Eggs Wine, Sugar and Cinnamon is good
for recovering the Powers.

31. I ordered these to be given to the Sick when the Spirits were exhausted
and the person ready to dye, and she found great help, for thereby the Spirits,
native heat, and blood were increased and restored.

32. The Yolks of Eggs are soon converted into Blood, much more Wine, which,
according to Galen, is the best and swiftest of Nutritives.

33. And as for Sugar, Nature soon embraces it, because of its sweetness, and
is most grateful to it, as also Cinnamon which by its Aromaticity strengthens
the Heart and all the Members, according to Avicenna.

34. Now, if the Patient be much the better by this abovementioned drink; I
shall restore her exhausted humidity by generous red Wine somewhat tempered
with Water.

35. By these aforesaid helps I strengthened the Patient, and the great Flux of
Blood was stopped; now, lest there might happen any more fits; I purged her with
gentle repeated Purgations which could not do her any harm.

36. The Syrups were as follows: Take Oxymel simple, then of Squils, with the
syrup of Betony in a Decoction of Hyssop, Betony, Sage, Germander and
Ground Pine; roots of Acorus, Elecampane and Peony with its seeds, Misletoe of
the Oak, the flowers of Frankincense and Staechas, with Nutmegs and Cinnamon.

37. I purged her with Agarick and Rhubarb, Ginger being added, salt Gem,
Schoenanthus and Cinnamon, all infused in the Waters of Hyssop and Bugloss with
a little Honey of Roses; they being strained, I put thereto two drams of
Diaphenicon.

38. From the Decoction of the precedent Apozem, I prepared a Potion which did
work happily, and carried away much watery phlegm.

39. I used also the pil. Cochiae with Agarick and powder of Sena prepared, and
the following Confection, which she found good of.

40. Take Conserve of Acorus, one ounce: Conserve of the flowers of Sage,
Rosemary and Staechas, of each half an ounce: Emblick Myrobalans candied,
number two: the bark of Citron-peels, six drams: the powder of Man's skull, one
dram and half: the powder of Doronicum, one dram: the powder of Diamoschi
Dulcis, two scruples: powder of Diamargaritum frigidum, half a dram: the grains
of Peony, two scruples: the syrup of the Conserves of Emblicks, a sufficient
quantity: make an Opiate, and every o her day take three drams with a fasting
Stomach.

41. After Purgation, I ordered Errhines of the Decoction of sweet Marjoram and
Agarick with a little Ginger, the juice of Pimpernel bearing a purple flower,
and the juice of black beet being added.

42. By the help of these Remedies she was cured, and had no fits for the space
of three years, (which at last were occasioned, though then very moderate by
some Irregularity, in her Diet) according to that of Hippocrates, whoever have
the Falling Sickness before ripeness of Age, meet with a Change, but those that
have it about 25 years old, die. Franciscus Valeriola, lib. 4. Observe. 6.

LXXVI. An Epilepsy beginning with a Vertigo.

1. A comely Maid descended from Parents indifferently Healthful, being her
self very well, till the time she had arrived at ripeness of Age; about which
time she complained of her Head, as if she felt near the forepart thereof, such
a Vertigo or Giddiness that all things seemed to run round, whilst this Symptom
continued, she was wont to talk impertinently, and to forget whatever she had
formerly spoken or done.

2. At first these Fits were but of a short Duration, not continuing above a
quarter of an hour, and siezed her again only once or twice in a Month, being
pretty well in the Interval.

3. Afterward the Fits returned oftener, by assaults gradually more grievous,
and within half a year her Brain being daily more weakened, this giddiness was
undeniably changed into the Epilepsy, insomuch that every fit struck the person
down to the Ground, being affected at the same time with horrid Convulsions,
foaming at the Mouth and great insensibility.

4. The servants observed that she still fell on the same side; and if at any
time she was near the fire, and did sit in the right Corner, she was flung in
the midst of the Fire; but if in the left Corner, she fell against the wall of
the Chimney.

5. Once being left alone; she fell into the Fire, and so lamentably burned her
Face and fore part of her Head, that the skull was made bare of the skin and
flesh, and a deep and large Scar was burnt into it, and afterward the out
shell of it fell off a hands breath.

6. But so long as the Ulcer in this Maid contracted by the burning, ran with
filthy matter, she was eased from the fits; afterward they being healed up,
the Malady returned again.

7. The first appearance of this Disease was about the time of Puberty: For
presently after the beginning of it, she had her Courses; which constantly kept
their set times, though the Distemper grew daily worse and worse.

8. None of all the various kinds of Medidicines, which were discreetly
administered, availed her any thing, it being the unhappy custom and practice of
her and her Friends to change often, both Physician and method of Physic; if
the expected Event did not happily follow; and court every Emperick and
outlandish Mountebank for a Cure.

9. The Vertiginous disposition accompanied with a short Delirium being the
forgoer of the Epilepsy, it plainly denotes, the cause of this Distemper (being
planted in the middle of the Brain,) has its dependence upon a certain
Inordination of the spirits: viz.

10. Those Inhabiting there began to admit at first an heterogeneous Copula;
which being heaped up plentifully, and moved either of its own accord, or
accidentally; while it was shaken of; moved and inferred those Distempers by
reason of the spirits being molested and not yet very Explosive, afterward she
gradually growing worse, the perturbations of the spirits did excite their
manifest Explosions, and turned the Vertigo and Delirium into the Epilepsy.

11. From hence it must doubtlessly follow, the Maid being sick about her ripe
age, that as the Natural so the preternatural ferment Explicates it self first
at that time: wherefore as it falls out that the menstruous purgations do then
burst forth, so the seeds of the Falling Sickness, whether Innate or acquired
then budded forth a little, and by degrees were ripened to fruit.

12. When the preternatural ferment first appears, often times the natural
following it defaces and blots it out; hence the Epilepsy of young ones goes no
further than puberty or ripe age.

13. But if that ferment or taint of the Disease happens after the Menstruous
flux or together with it, and ceases not presently, it for the most part
remains during Life unconquerable, and not to be vanquished by any remedies.

14. If a Cautery, by chance being made on this sick person, freed her from
fits of the Disease, it may then be very justly concluded that fontanels or
Issues may be advantagiously administered in the Cure of the Epilepsy.

15. For wheresoever an Emissary is opened for the constant Evacuation of the
serours water, both from the Blood and Nervous juice, there flows out with it
very many Heterogeneous and morbifick particles, that thereby the Brain might
be freed and discharged from the Disease, Willis de Convulsivis, Cap. 3.
Observe. 1.

LXXVII. Epilepsy Ideopathick, Or Originally in the Head.

1. A Brewers Daughter of Oxford, had been from her Infancy very subject to a
Rheum in her Eyes, otherwise of a strong and healthful constitution, being
daily accustomed and inured to hard Labor.

2. About the fourteenth year of her Age; she began to be afflicted with
Epileptick fits, which she had near the greater Changes of the moon.

3. Being invited to her Cure, I gave her a Vomit of Precipitate Solar, and
ordered it to be renewed three days before every New and Full Moon; besides
that she should take twice in a day, a dram of male-peony root in powder, with
a draught of black Cherry water.

4. There happened so long an Intermission of the fits, by virtue of these
Medicines, that she seemed to approach very near to a Cure: afterward when
they returned, the very same Medicines recovered her, and then the Menstruous
flux breaking forth and keeping its true Periods, she was for the future
happily delivered from that Disease.

5. I think it not amiss, in the curing of the Epilepsy to begin with a
Cathartick, but if the sick can easily endure Vomiting, first let an Emetick be
administered and repeated for several months, four days before the full of the
Moon.

6. For Infants and Youths may be prescribed wine of squills, mixed with the
fresh Oil of sweet Almonds: as also salt of Vitriol from half a scruple to one
scruple.

7. Those of riper years and of a stronger constitution may take the following
Medicines: Take of Crocus Metallorum or Mercurius vitae, four grains to six: or
Mercurius dulcis, sixteen grains to one scruple: bruise them together in a
Mortar, mix them with the pap of a roasted Apple, or Conserve of Burrage, one
ounce: make a Bolus.

8. Or you may take an Infusion of Crocus Metalorum or Mercurius vitae in
spanish wine from half an ounce to one ounce and half: Or take of Emetick
Tartar of Mynsicht four grains to six.

9. They who are of a weaker and tenderer Constitution, let them take of the
salt of Vitriol, one scruple to half a dram, and half an hour after let them
drink several pints of posset drink, and then provoke and reiterate Vomiting,
by putting a Feather or Finger down the Throat.

10. The day after Vomiting, unless there be a just cause of forbearance, let
the Blood be taken out of the Arm, or from the Hemorrhoid Veins with a Leech:
then the next day after let a purging Medicine be taken, which may be repeated
constantly four days before every new Moon.

11. Take resine of Jalap, half a scruple: Mercurius dulcis, one scruple: of
Castor, three grains: of Conserve of the flowers of Peony, one ounce: make all
into a Bolus.

12. Take pil. faetidae the greater, two scruples: pil. Histericae, a
sufficient qantity, make thereof five pills:

13. Take of the strings of black Hellebore, macerated in Vinegar, dried and
poudered, half an ounce: of Ginger, half a scruple: of the salt of Wormwood,
twelve grains: of the Oil of Amber, two drops, make a powder, and give it in
the pap of an Apple.

14. Take of the powder of Hermodactils compound, one ounce: of humane skull
prepared, six grains: make a powder, let it be given in a draught of the
Decoction of Hyssop or Sage.

15. On the days wherein they do not purge, let there be Administered specific
remedies morning and evening, about the time of the change of the Moon: For in
these there is virtue (as is said) to Cure this Disease by a certain Innate and
secret Energy: of these there are a great many to be found, and are prescribed
in various forms of Compositions.

16. The most simple Medicines, which experience has found to be very
successful, are the roots of the male Peony, and the seeds of the same. Take of
the roots of the male Peony, powdered and dried one dram, to two or three; give
it twice a day in the following Tincture.

17. Take leaves of missletoe of the Oak, two ounces: of the root of Peony
sliced, half an ounce: of Castor, one ounce: put them into a close Vessel, with
simple water of Betony or Peony, and white wine, of each one pound: of the salt
of missletoe of the Oak, or the common missletoe, two ounces: let them digest
close in hot sand for two days, take three ounces: with a dose of the aforesaid
powder.

18. The poorer sort of people may take of the aforesaid powder in a decoction
of Hyssop or Castor, made with fair water and white Wine.

19. Cut also the root of Peony into little bits, and being strung upon a
thread, hung about the Neck (I suppose both after the manner of a Neck-lace, and
also so as to touch the pit of the Stomach, or Region of the Heart:) also let
the roots being fried in a pan, or boiled tender, be eaten daily with their
Meat.

20. Take of the roots and seeds of male Peony, of each two ounces: of
missletoe of the Oak, of Elks-hoof, one dram, each let them be sliced and
bruised and put into a thin silk bag and hung at the pit of the Somach.

21. Among the specificks this powder is highly esteemed of among many Authors:
Take of Castor, Opopanax, Dragons blood, Antimony, and the seed of Peony, each
alike; make a powder, of which may be taken half an ounce, to one ounce, every
morning with Wine or some proper decoction, or with black Cherry water.

22. Take of man's skull prepared, one ounce: of missletoe of the Oak, of
Artificial Cinabar, of an Elks Claw, of each half an ounce, mingle them: the
dose is half a scruple to one scruple.

23. If the powder be unpleasant and loathsome by the long use of it;
Electuaries, pills, Troches, spirits and Elixirs are usually prescribed; each
of which agree with specific Medicines.

24. Take of the Conserve of male-peony, of the Lilley of the valley, of each
three ounces: of the seed and root of male-peony powdered, of each six drams:
prepared Coral, one dram: of powder of pearls, and of humane skull prepared, of
each two scruples: of the salt of missletoe of the Oak, one dram and half: with
a sufficient quantity of the syrup of Coral, make an Electuary: Take the
quantity of a Nutmeg morning and evening.

25. Take the powder of the roots of male-peony, one ounce: of the seeds of the
same, half an ounce: of missletoe of the Oak, of an Elks Claw, of humane skull
prepared, of each two drams: of the roots of Angelica, Contrayerva, Virginian
snake-root, of each one dram: of the whitest Amber, of calcined Coral, of each
one dram: of the common salt, of missletoe, two drams: of Sugar Candy, eight
ounces: with a sufficient quantity, of the Antepileptical water, of Langius,
make a Confection, of which take the quantity of a Nutmeg, twice a day.

26. These powders may be formed into a pilulary mass, by adding to them the
salts of Amber and Hartshorn, with a sufficient quantity of Balsam Capivi, of
which may be taken three or four pills in the morning and evening, drinking
after them a draught of some appropriate Liquor.

27. Or, of these sorts may be prepared an Elixir, of which may be taken from
seven to ten drops twice a day, in a spoonful of a proper Julep, taking a
little of it after it.

28. Take of Hungarian Vitriol, six pound, let them be distilled with a glass
Retort in a hot sand for twenty four hours, then let the same Retort, being
defended or covered over with Clay, be put with a large receiver in a
reverberating furnace, that the Acid spirits may be forced with a strong fire,
till they come forth: the whole Liquor being distilled, draw it off in hot
sand, in a lesser glass Retort, and let there be poured out into the Mattress,
of the roots of male-peony, cut in pieces and dried, four ounces: of the seeds
of the same one ounce: of humane skull prepared, of Elks Claws, and red Coral,
of each half an ounce: missletoe of the Oak, two drams: let it digest for
several days with a gentle heat, to the Extraction of a tincture, the liquour
being decanted, let it be drawn off in a glass Retort to a third part remaning;
being stilled forth, keep it by it self.

29. To these remains, pour on of the rectified spirits of wine, a small
quantity, impregnated with the Infusion of the same Ingredients, and let it
digest for six days in Horse-dung, the dose of which is half a scruple to one
scruple: the distilled Liquour may be given from half a spoonful to a whole
spoonful, for the same Intentions.

30. Or let there be an Oil prepared out of the salt of Venus or Copper,
according to there Prescription of Henry Van Heers.

31. Among the specific remedies, which (when the former shall not be
profitable) ought also to be tried are the Livers of Frogs, the Gall of a Boar
dried with Urine, the powder of Briony roots; The powder of the Cucow, of
Crows; the Runnet and lights of a Hare, the Liver of a wolf, stones taken out
of Swallows, the Liver of a Kite, the eggs of Crows, with many more to be daily
taken with food or Medicine; a notable Catalogue of which is Extant of Henry
Van Brays, a Physician of Zutphen, from which may be had such prescriptions for
poor people, as are easy to be prepared, and no great Cost.

32. Whilst these kind of remedies are to be inwardly taken, according to the
aforesaid Method, some outward Administrations being applied, bring help, and
are deservedly admitted to part of the Cure; therefore always Issues are made
in this Disease, in one fit place* or other, also more often Vesicatories or
Blisters.

33. Amulets hung about the Neck, or born at the pit of the Stomach, are
Counted useful; the fresh roots of Peony, cut into little squares, and being
strung like Bracelets, and hung about the Neck, and as soon as they are dry,
let new be put into their places, and they being reduced to powder, may be
taken Inwardly.

34. Take of the roots and seeds of Peony, of each two drams: of Elks claw and
Humane skull prepared, of each one dram: of the missletoe of the Oak, half a
dram: let them be beaten into a gross powder, and put into a piece of red silk,
and let it be hanged like a little bag about the Neck.

35. An Amulet of a stalk of Elder, found growing in the Willow-tree, is hugely
approved of.

36. It does not disagree with some to have their Heads shaven, and a plaster
applied to the fore part: Take of the roots and seeds of Peony, of Castor, of
missletoe of the Oak, humane skull most finely poudered, of each one dram: of
Betony plaster, two ounces: Caranna, tacamahacca, of each two drams: Balsam
Capivi, a sufficient quantity, make a mass and spread it upon Leather, and make
a plaster for the sutures of the Head.

37. Anoint the Temples and Nostrills with Oil of Amber, either by it self or
mixed with Oil of Capivi.

38. You may use every morning, Snezing pouders, and such as purge the Head of
Rhume: Take of white Hellebor, one dram: of Castor and Euphorbium, of each half
ae dram: the leaves of sweet Marjoram and Rue, of each two drams: make a powder.

39. Make a decoction of Sage or Hyssop, with Mustard dissolved in it, with
which gargle the Mouth and Throat; and if need shall require, you may use
sometimes a Clister.

40. The more solid Medicines may be moistened sometimes with Liquids, or they
ought to be drunk after them, for which end you should never want distilled
waters, Juleps, Tinctures, or Decoctions, which are endued with a certain
specific Virtue against this Disease.

41. Take of Hungarian Vitriol, four pounds: of the powder of fresh humane
skull, four ounces: of the root of Peony sliced, six ounces: bruise them
together in a Mortar, add to them a quart of Spanish wine, or small white Wine,
or wine made of the juice of black Cherries; which ferment in a Vessel, then
distill it in a glass Retort in hot s^nd.

42. Take of the shavings of Box-wood, of Hungarian Vitriol, of each two
pounds: missletoe of the Oak, or the common missetoe leaves, three handfulls:
of Rue, two handfulls: being bruised together, put to it of spanish wine two
quarts: and distill them in a glass Cucurbit with hot sand.

43. Take of common Vitriol, six pound: of the root of male Peony, six ounces:
if the missletoe of the Oak, one ounce: of Green Walnuts, eight ounces: cut and
bruise them, afterward distill them in a glass pot, placing upon it a glass
Alembick, in hot sand: take of this liquor one pint: of black Cherry water, and
of the water of the flower of the Line-tree, of each half a pint, of white
sugar, four ounces: mix and make a Julep, the Dose two ounces to three, twice
or thrice a day.

44. Oxymel of squils, also a Decoction of Hysop sweetened with Honey, are much
commended by ancient Authors.

45. Or an Apozem of this kind may be prepared, of which may be taken four
ounces to six or eight ounces twice in a day: Take of the roots of Male-Peony,
Angelica, Imperatoria, Valerian, of each six drams: of the leaves of Betony,
sage, Lilly of the Valley, Pennyroyal, of each one handful: of the seeds of
Rue, Nigella, of each three drams: Peony, half an ounce: of Raisons, three
ounce^: Liquorice, half an ounce: cut and bruise them, and then boil them in
six parts of spring water to the consumption of the third part: toward the end
add black Cherry Wine, half a pint, or ten ounces; strain and keep it in close
Vessels; the Dose is from six to eight ounces twice a day, after the
abovementioned remedies.

46. Or, the above prescribed Ingredients, Raisons and Liquoriee excepted, may
be boiled in six pints of Hydromel, or Water and Honey, or Mead, to the
consumption of the third part; the Dose four ounces to six.

47. If that the aforesaid method, consisting in the use of Catharticks and
Specificks, be tried for some time, and altogether in vain, you must use
Remedies of another kind, and chiefly in the Catalogue of those Remedies that
deserves the denomination and character of great and notable, may be justly
placed, Diaphoreticks, Salivation, Baths and Spaws.

48. Alphonsus Ferrius relates, that he had cured many Epileptical people with
a Decoction of simple Guajacum, taken to six or eight ounces, and its second
Decoction drunk (as in the Cure of the Pox) instead of ordinary Drink.

49. If to such a Decoction the Roots of Peony and other Specificks should be
added, perhaps it would be more effectual.

50. Its not improbable that a salivation strongly excited from Mercury, and
afterward a sudoriferous or Sweating Diet following, might perfectly Cure this
Disease.

51. What Baths or Spaw-waters are capable to do, I have not observed either by
my own, or others Experience. Perhaps, I may have made a Trial, that our
Artificial Spaws have been sometimes profitable and available in curing the
Epilepsy, viz. both those impregnated with Iron, and also those with Antimony,
provided they be taken in great quantity for many days. Willis de Convulsivis,
cap. 3. Observe. 2.

LXXVIII. An Epilepsy with Convulsions.

1. A Maid of nine years old was sometimes afflicted with the Epilepsy, for
almost every day toward the Evening* she complained of Pains in the lower part
of the Belly; after which there followed Convulsions, Giddiness, and as it were
a turning round of the Brain, then she fell, having some appearance or show of
Epileptical Convulsions in her Countenance, and in that by consent; but, as to
her Members, she was free from any Convulsion in them.

2. Now there was a Conjecture made, that there was in her some crude,
phlegmatic and pituitous matter, apt and inclinable to putrefaction, out of
which Worms had been, or is now, or may be bred.

3. First, let her take of the following Electuary of Raisons Laxative, two or
three spoonfuls in the Morning: Take Raisons laxative, two ounces and half:
syrupus Polychrestus, one ounce: Balsam of sulphur, six drops: the spirit of
salt, four drops: Oil of Anise, three drops: mix them.

4. The Belly thereby being put into a good frame, she found ease the very same
day that she had used them, and was not taken as formerly.

5. I prescribed this: Take of syrup of Roses solutive, syrupus Polychrestus,
of each two drams: the extract of Diagridium dissolved in a little Water, two
grains: Oxymel of Squills, one dram: Oil of Oranges, one drop: mix and let them
be given.

6. After two or three days intermission and rest: Take syrupus Polychrestus,
half an ounce: extract of Diagridium, two grains: Oxymel of squils, one dram
and half: white Tartar Vitriolated, five grains: Cream of Tartar* six grains:
Oil of Fennel, spirit of salt, of each two drops: mix as above.

7. After these, let her proceed to the use of the following things: Take the
bark of Orange-peels, one ounce and half: Hartshorn prepared, one dram and
half: roots of Peony, two drams: Briony, two drams: boil them in
fountain water, one pound, to the consumption of the half: take of the strained
liquor half a pound, and add thereto two ounces of white sugar: boil till it be
somewhat thick; then add the syrups of Peony, of Limons, of Wormwood, of each
half an ounce: of the salt of Wormwood, half a scruple: the water of Nutmegs,
six drams: mix them.

8. Take roots of Peony, the flowers of Orrice, red Coral prepared, of each
half a dram: white Amber prepared, Hartshorn prepared, of each two scruples:
Misletoe of the Oak, Coralline, each sixteen grains: Worm-seed, twelve grains:
Conserve of Wormwood, two scruples: sugar dissolved in Wormwood-water, three
ounces: make Troches or Tablets, according to Art; add the Oil of Oranges, two
drops: the spirit of Salt, one drop.

9. Afterward let then be used one after another, with a fasting Stomach, two
or three hours before Meat; three or four Tablets, or about two spoonfuls of
the Syrup: In the Evening, let her take again two Rowls or Tablets before
Supper; and when she goes to bed, let her take one Roll. Grulingius, Cent. Obs.
35.

LXXIX. An Epilepsy in another Maid.

1. I prescribed this Maid the following Medicines: Take syrupus Polycrestus,
two ounces: of Peony, of Betony, of each two drams: Electuarium Passularum
Laxativum, three drams: the powder of the roots of Mechoacan, two scruples: the
Oil of Anise, of Rosemary-flowers, of each one drop: the spirit of Elder, half
a scruple: mix them, and let them be used three times.

2. Take the Epileptick water of Langius, one ounce: the spirit of the flowers
of Elder, half a scruple: Oil of Rosemary flowers and Marjoram, of each one
drop: syrup of Peony, a sufficient quantity, make a mixture, and use them
Morning and Evening.

3. Take the Oil of Nutmegs, two scruples: Vnguentum Pomatum, one scruple: the
Oils of Lavender, of Marjoram, of Rosemary-flowers, of Amber, of Rue, of each
two drops: Castoreum, two grains: mix them, and make a Liniment, to anoint the
nape of the Neck, Nostrils and the Coronal Sutures. Grulingius, Cent. Observe.
36.

LXXX. The Epilepsy without a Convulsion.

1. A certain Woman about the Age of twenty eight, having swallowed a Bodkin in
her Infancy, she presently felt no harm by it, though it remained still in her
Body.

2. It was observed, that being Married, she often stood in amaze and
stupefaction, with Lips wide open, and with Eyes pulled aside, looking sternly.
She suffered somewhat like to the Epilepsy, therefore it was concluded, that
Vapors did ascend from the lower parts; but that they could excite such
grievious Fits and assaults as are in a strong Epilepsy, is somewhat strange.

3. They resemble rather these Vapors proceeding from a Vertigo, which assault
the Brain, as it were without any Convulsion, but with the Hallucination only,
and deception of the Senses.

4. For evacuation, I prescribed, first Electuarium Diacatholicon and
Diaphenicon, Confectio Hamech, of each one dram: the extract of black Hellebor,
six grains: Diagridium, two grains: Conserve of Betony, one scruple: Aniseeds,
half a scruple: make a Bolus with Sugar.

5. Secondly, for purging the Head and Ventricle: Take Pills of Mastich,
Cothiarum, Aurearum, Foetidarum, of each half a dram: Troches Alhandal, half a
scruple: Diagredium, three grains: Mastich, eight grains: make with
Betony-water, one and twenty Pills to be taken thrice.

6. And every month, for three days before a Full Moon; let her take a Dose at
two a Clock in the Night, and Sleep thereafter two hours.

7. Thirdly, For Corroberation, Take Rob Juniperi, one ounce: Conserve of
Betony, two drams and half: Peony, one dram and half: the powder of the roots
of Peony, one dram: the flowers of Orrice, half a dram: Misletoe of the Oak,
one scruple: white Amber prepared, half a scruple: Human skull prepared, six
grains: the seeds of Rue, twenty three grains: syrups of Betony, and of Peony,
of each a sufficient quantity: make an Electuary, and take every Morning, and
at going to bed, the quantity of a great Bean, or more.

LXXXI. The Epilepsy in a Maid.

1. At the command of a certain Illustrious person a Duchess, I prescribed
these following Medicines for this Noble Virgin: Take the seeds and roots of
Peony, of each five grains: choice Turbith, roots of Mechoacan, species
Diaturbith with Rhubarb, our Cathartick Powder, each seven grains: Tartar
vitriolated, five grains: Diagridium, four grains: Gum Guttae, one grain:
choice Cinnamon, six grains: make a most subtle powder.

2. Take the leaves of Marjoram Thyme, Rosemary, of each two scruples: the
flowers of Lavender, of Betony, of Prim-roses, of Tile-tree, of Origanum, and
of Stoechas, of each half a dram: the seeds of Peony, two drams: of Anise, one
dram: Fennel and Coriander prepared, half a dram: the roots of Peony, of
Orrice-flowers, of each two drams and half: the Wood of Sassafras, three drams:
Misletoe of the Oak, Cinnamon, Mace, Nutmeg, of each one dram: white sugar, one
ounce: cut, bruise, and make a powder of them, and so let them be given.

3. Take syrups of Peony, one ounce: of Betony, six drams: of staechas, two
drams: of Cinnamon, two drams and a half: the extract of Juniper, two drams: of
Zedoaria, five grains: Conserves of Rosemary-flowers, one dram: Conserves of
Bawm, of Borrage, of Betony, of each one dram and half: spirits of
Elder-flowers and of Juniper Berries, of each two scruples: the Essences of
Rosemary-flowers, one scruple: the powder of Peony roots, half a dram:
Orrice-flowers, one scruple: white Amber prepared, half a scruple: the
Epileptick water of Langius, three drams: Lozenges of sugar pearled, two drams:
make a mixture. Grulingius, Cent. Observe. 37.

LXXXII. The Epilepsy.

1. A certain person, called Marcus Antonius, fell into terrible and outrageous
Fits, not unlike those of the Epilepsy, when at first this Disease assaulted
him, he was afflicted with manifest and noted Palpitations of the Heart, which
were also accompanied with a mighty oppression and wonderful dejection of the
Strength, together with some Convulsive Motions, he was necessitated sometimes
to make use of the nearest Seats, or to sit down on the ground.

2. At length being purged with Pil. Catholicae: and the Brain being
strengthened with Cephalic Conserves, the Balsam of Vitriol being added, he was
restored to Health again.

3. There was also exhibited a Stomachal Specific, by which chiefly he was
eased. Poterius, Cent. 1. Obs. 78.

LXXXIII. The Epilepsy in a Maid.

1. This Maid was often afflicted for the space of three years with an
Hereditary Epilepsy.

2. A little before the assault and invasion of this Distemper, she was taken
with a dimness of sight, and then fell flat on the ground, being first siezed
with a Convulsion of her Members.

3. In this deplorable p^sture she would lie about half an hour, as if she were
Dead, with Arms and Legs stretched out, foaming greatly at the Mouth; and being
altogether forgetful of what had happened to her; but the fit being over, and
the Muscles resolved, she went to Stool.

4. This affect she deriving as Hereditary from her Father, I was earnest to
search out the causes of so great a Malady; and upon diligent scrutiny, I found
that her Father had not only fallen often into Fits of the Falling Sickness;
but had also been often besides himself, and divested of the exercise of his
Reason, not unlike that kind of alienation of the Mind, which happens to
persons Lunatic.

5. I am certainly persuaded the reason of this name comes from nothing else
but the inordination of the several Motions; because as some do observe, this
sort of affect is moved and excited in the new of the Moon and its quarters.

6. But I am rather of the opinion, That this is to be ascribed to the Seed of
the Parent, than to any such obscure and remote Causes.

7. This Maid was at length freed from her Distemper by taking thrice the
Marchasite of saturn, which caused her to Vomit much phlegm and greenish Choler,
and to this purpose we prepared by calcination the Marchasite of Sasaturn, of
which in our Pharmacopoeia spagyrica in 3 cap. de stibio. She lived seven years
after the Cure was performed, without the lest hazard and suspicion of a
Relapse. Poterius, Cent. 2. Observe. 48.

LXXXIV. The Falling Sickness in a Child ten years of Age.

1. A Youth of about ten years of Age, was suddenly siezed with the Falling
sickness: He was first taken on the right side, it began always (when the
Paroxysm came) on his right Foot, ascended up by degrees like a Vapor, from
his Foot to his Ankle, so to his Knee, then his Hip, and from thence to his
Arm, Hand and Head, where having taken possession of the Brain, he presently
fell down with a great crying out, and a foaming at Mouth.

2. He was cured with the following things: Take Rosemary, sage, Bawm, Betony,
of each two handfuls; boil in ten or twelve quarts of Water to the consumption
of a third part, then strain, let it settle and bottle it up with a little
sugar. This was his constant Drink, he drank no other.

3. In the mean season, he was six or seven times or more purged with the
Infusion of the best sena with Carminative Seeds.

4. The Specific Antidote he took for the perfect Cure hereof was this. Take
fine powder of Man's skull, one ounce: powder of the seeds and roots of Male
Peony, powder of Misletoe of the Oak, of each five drams: powder of native
Cinnabar, of Peacocks dung, of Elks-hoof, Volatile salt of Amber, of each three
drams: Crystals of Luna, one dram: mix and make a powder: Dose from half a dram
to one dram or more, according as the Sick is in Age and Strength.

5. This was taken every night going to bed in the full Dose, for eight or ten
Weeks; and every Morning fasting, for the same space of time, in half the Dose.

6. All along, the Foot and Leg was anointed with this: Take Oil of Camomil,
four ounces: Oil of Nutmegs by expression, two ounces: Chemical Oils of
Rosemary and Sassafras, of each one ounce: mix them: with this not only the
Foot and Leg, but also the Hand, Arm, Shoulder, Backbone, Nape of the Neck,
Temples and Forehead, were all of them anointed Morning and Evening, and well
chased in before a good Fire.

7. By the only use of these Medicines was the Boy restored to his perfect
Health in about ten or twelve Weeks time, to the great joy of his Parents, and
remained well for many years after. Ex MSS. R. Turneri. Observe. 17.

LXXXV. An Epilepsy occasioned by troubles of the Mind.

1. A Gentleman while he was Sweating in a hot Bath, was taken with an
Epilepsy, and as often as he was Angry or had his Passions stirred and excited,
he fell into fits of this Disease, this Distemper was most afflicting in the
Night season.

2. I prescribed the following Pills: Take Pilulae Aggregativae, three
scruples: Castoreum, seven grains: with syrup of stoechas, make fifteen Pills,
and let him take them twice a day, Morning and Evening, with two spoonfuls of
the following Syrup: Take syrup of the flowers of Peony, two drams: Oxymel of
squils, syrup of stoechas, each one ounce: Peony-water, two ounces: the best
Cinnamon Water, five ounces: mix them.

3. Let him drink the following Decoctions for three months: Take shavings of
the Wood Guajacum, two ounces: fat or blew Raisons of the sun, three ounces:
the roots of Peony, the seeds of Anise and Fennel, each two drams: the leaves
of sage, Betony, Marjoram, the flowers of Rosemary, each one pugil: Cinnamon,
two scruples: Liquorice scrap't and cut, five ounces: Galangal, one dram: mix
and boil them in six quarts of Water. Wolfangus Gabelchoverius, Cent. 4.
Observe. 59.

LXXXVI. An Epilepsy prevented.

1. A certain Woman having repaired to hot Baths, because of the pain in her
Reins and Loins; within two days after bathing, she fell into disquieted
Slumbering accompanied with great Terror; and whilst she endeavored to shut
her Eyes and compose her self for a repose, she felt a vehement burning heat
about her Loins, and the forepart of the Belly and Sides.

2. Another misfortune had attended her not long before, which was the breaking
of her Arm; now fearing that she might be Epileptick, because of her once
Swooning away and voiding then some Froth at her Mouth; and complaining of
frequent Eructuations and Belchings; I advised for prevention of this Disease,
to take the following Cordial-water.

3. Take of the four Cordials Waters, and the water of Langius against the
Apoplexy, of each one ounce: Lozenges of sugar pearled, Amber, of each one
ounce: mix them.

4. Afterward, the middle Vein of the left Arm may be opened, or the
Salvatella in the Hand; and that it was convenient to forbear the use of the
Bath unless she should stay for some short time therein; having followed my
advice, she became well, and was freed from that Disease.

5. Naturalists observe, That the Eye of a Wolf dried and hung about the Neck,
is an Amulet or preservative not only against the Epilepsy, but also banishes
and drives away all fear and terror happening in Sleep; some join both
together, the right Eye of a he-Wolf, and the left Eye of a she-Wolf, and hangs
them about the Neck, and they ascribe greater Virtue to them.

6. Others advise, to use the he-Wolfes Eye for the right, and the she-Wolfs to
the left Eye: It is also affirmed, that they sleep sweetly and securely without
all fear, who are covered with a Wolves Skin; lastly, they ascribe wonderful
virtue and efficacy in Physic to this Creature, and its parts; whereof I have
treated particularly in my Book De Lupo.

7. Another preservative from the Falling Sickness, is a Ring made of
Elks-hoof, to be worn next the Skin; also the root of Elder growing upon a
Willow-tree, if it be hanged about the Neck does wonderfully preserve from the
Epilepsy.

8. Smaragds or Emeralds hanged about the Neck, may be used by such as are
Rich; so likewise the Head of a Cuckoo tied about the Neck is thought a great
preservative from that Disease; for it attracts and draws it to its self, as a
Load stone does Iron.

9. Let the person dwell in a hot and dry Air, free from smoke, chiefly of
Coals, not cloudy, nor windy, without dust or any stinking smell, having the
enjoyment of the Beams both of the Sun and Moon.

10. Let him or her carefully avoid high, piercing and dissonant sounds, and
such as are terrefying, with all rustling Noises; they must not look nor stare
on things that turn round, or dances, or things that are profound and splendid;
neither must they look on places too obscure and dark.

11. They must shun all stinking and loathsome Smells, by which some have
instantly fallen into Epileptick fits, such are Turf, Agath-stone, Hartshorn,
Bdellium, Storax, and such like things; also things of a bitter Taste must not
be taken.

12. As to things tangible, he must have a care of such as are of a swift and
acute Impression.

13. Let him avoid sleep in the day time, and sleeping late with his Feet
covered.

14. Meats to be used are such as afford good Nutriment, and are easily
digested, and are not mixed with any flatuous quality; of this kind is, Bread
well fermented and baked, not older then one or two days: Rear-Eggs, the Flesh
of mountain Fowls, Partridges, Pigeons, Turtle Doves.

15. As for Quails, they must not be eaten because of an innate and natural
consent and tendency they have to excite Epileptick fits, the flesh of Sheep
and others Animals for the same reason must not be eaten: as also the flesh of
those Creatures that are old, and such as affords a thick and gross Aliment, as
Beef and Swines flesh: (all this is not Gospel.) For these breeds adust
Melancholy, and too great a plenty of Phlegm.

16. Likewise the Marrow and Brains of Animals is not good (this is scarcely a
kin to Truth;) we do not dis-allow the use of Veal and Kid, although
Hippocrates is of the Mind, that Goats-flesh is very dangerous and pernicious
in this Disease.

17. As to Fish, they are seldom to be eaten, and if any, those which have
Scales and live in stony or gravelly places.

18. We cannot allow the use of many Herbs, these few are safe, Succory,
Capers, Asparagus, Sorrel, Pimpernel, Mint: (Onions, Garlic and Leeks, and
such like ignoble Meat we forbid.)

19. As to Fruits, we indulge the use, if sparingly taken, of the Pistach-nut,
the Kernel of the Pine, Raisons, Pears and Apples boiled, sweet Prunes, ripe
Figs, Spices, and Treacles are sometimes profitable.

20. Cheese, and all things made of Milk, the seldomer they are eaten, the
better; but chiefly beware of indigestion and crudities at all times.

21. The greater number of Physicians, commands such persons to abstain from
Wine, unless the Stomach be cold, and if so, there must be regard both to the
quantity and quality of the Wine, yet it may be drunk, if there be no just fear
of a fit.

22. They may drink Muscadel wherein Rosemary and Hysop are, because it does
not only not fill the Head, but comforts by its own efficacy and discusses and
resolves the thick and viscous humors.

23. Lastly, let him live soberly not passing the bounds of moderation: nothing
is more hurtful to Epileptick persons than Venery, which indeed is of it self a
small kind of Epilepsy, resembling the Disease so called in Motion, Breathing
and Sweat, turning of the Eyes and redness of the Face, leaving the person
after the Act pale, weak and sad.

24. Spring and Fall, if necessity requires, you may open a Vein, chiefly in
the Legs, and in the Ankle-bone, the frequent Scarification of the Legs about
the Anckle-bone does wonderfully contribute toward the repelling the matter
from ascending to the Head.

25. I approve of frequent and repeated evacuation by Pills, made as they
should be, such are pilulae Aureae, Arabicae, Aloephanginae, Aggregativae, sine
quibus and Mastich.

26. In Purgation, you must take care of moving and stirring too much, but
rather endeavor to carry off the matter as it were by stealth; purge not too
much at once.

27. Antidotes after universal evacuations ought not to be pretermitted, such
as Mithridate, by which thing alone Bernhardus Gordonius affirms, He can
preserve any person from the Epilepsy; Conserves of Stoechas and Rosemary, are
very good and profitable. Wolfangus Gabelchoverus, Cent. 4. Cur. 60.

LXXXVII. An Epilepsy caused from the translation of the morbifick matter.

1. A Noble Dane complained of an internal pain in his Ears, where a hard
Swelling, or knob appeared, I advised him to use a softning and resolving
Fomentation with a new Sponge, together with a like Ointment.

2. All the Care was, That the aforesaid Swelling should not come to an
Apostume and Suppuration, and that the pain should be in some measure remitted,
but the rest of the Cure was neglected.

3. At length he was taken with a grievious Epilepsy, whose fierceness and
exacerbation was somewhat allayed by the use of proper means, but was never
wholly overcome: from whence according to the Prognosticon, having had many
Relapses, he at last dyed.

4. It is dangerous, when the course of ill humors near the principal parts,
run from the external to the internal parts; which is here done.

5. Now although there appears no hope of recovery, because of the vehemence of
the Symptoms, yet we esteemed it necessary, That the vehemence of the Paroxysms
be infringed.

6. We have raised one from the Fits by Rue bruised and macerated in Vinegar;
some drops of the Oil of Amber, being put up into the Nostrils by a Pen, and
the Fit being in some measure abated, we have exhibited for corroboration, a
spoonful or two of the Spirit of black Cherries, also some of the spirit of
Peony-flowers mixed with the spirit of Vitriol.

7. His Head being Shaven, we ordered the application of Emplastrum Cratonis,
which is as follows: Take white Amber, Frankincense, Mastich, of each one dram
and half: Galbanum, Opopanax, of each one scruple: Misletoe of the Oak, two
drams: Ambergrise, six grains: Musk, three grains: seeds of Peony, half a dram:
Labdanum, one dram and half: a little of the Oils of Nutmegs, and of Roses a
sufficient quantity, mix and make an Emplaster: spread it upon Leather, then
sprinkle thereon of the powder of Cubebs, and apply it to the Coronal Suture.

8. By the use of these things, we brought the person to some better state, to
wit, the Remission of these grievious accidents, whereby the sick was restored
to his right Wits, and could easily know the standers by, and discourse with
them for a time.

9. At last falling into more grievious and lasting Fits, he paid the Debt he
owed to Nature.

10. Another like case, but the event more happy, we have. A certain person
being for a long time full of the Itch and Scabs, and neglecting such internal
Medicaments as are necessary for purifying of the Blood; and such as were
external being only applied, the peccant matter was carried into the inward
parts, and then having afterward drank a little more Wine than ordinary, by
the spirituous substance of the Wine perhaps, moving forwards the peccant
quality to the beginning of the Nerves he suffered a grievious Epilepsy.

11. We prescribed preservatives against the Paroxysms, who after sleep grew
much better, and a few universal Medicines being afterward exhibited, he grew
perfectly well again. Gregorius Horstius, Tom. 2. Lib. 2. Observe. 21.

LXXXVIII. An outrageous assault of the Epilepsy, by which was caused the
contraction and shrinking of the Nerves, of the right Hand and Foot.

1. A Noble and Virtuous Woman had an Epileptick Fit by consent from the Womb;
insomuch, that for the most part the right side of the Body, the Arm and Hand,
the Knee and Foot of the same side were drawn together.

2. Immediately having purged the whole Body by a repeated laxative Claret, we
attempted by Ointments and Cataplasms to soften and loosen the Fingers that
were contracted, a daily fomentation of the Decoction of Sheeps feet in
softning and mollyfying Herbs being super-added.

3. So by little and little we extended the Fingers, though not without
sensible pain, but they continuing unmovable, after Fomentation the whole Arm
was covered over with a Cerecloath of Wax, Rosin, Turpentine and Nutmeg, which
being done, we hoped to see some good effect of it.

4. But not finding that desired success, we advised going to the Baths, by the
benefit of which (presently) the very first Week she could move the Joints of
her Hand.

5. After this, intermediate evacuations not being omitted, she continued the
use of Baths, by which her Hand was not only restored, but her Foot also was
much helped.

6. Besides the Ointments and Cerecloaths that was applied, there was a
convenient Instrument used for the extention of the Foot, by which in the space
of a few Weeks, it was by Gods Blessing, reduced to its former natural state of
strength and eveness. Gregorius Horstius, Tom. 2. Lib. 2. Observe. 22.

LXXXIX. An Epileptick Convulsion.

1. My Son of about twenty years of Age, of a Melancholy Disposition, being for
some time afflicted with a continual malignant Fever; was at last happily
freed therefrom, but when all appeared to be well, and he seemed to be
perfectly recovered, he was all on a sudden taken with Epileptick Convulsions:

2. Sometimes his Legs only were at certain intervals molested, when the
Paroxysm siezed him; he made such a Snorting noise, that he could be heard in
the very Streets, in these Fits he was in great danger of Suffocation.

3. When I had pondered the various circumstances, and first his Melancholy
disposition, I began to observe, That these Symptoms did not depend by an
Ideopathy from the Brain, but by a Sympathy from the Hypochondria, under which
the Mesaraick Veins lurketh an abundance of vicious Melancholy humors mixed
with Choler and Phlegm, from the fermentation of which is excited a certain kind
of putridness.

4. And from those malignant and corrupt Vapors, invading the Brain and
Nervous parts, and irritating the expulsive Faculty by their inimical quality,
Convulsive Motions are excited.

5. In this opinion I am confirmed, not by frivolous guesses and conjectures;
for the Paroxysm returning, he was astonished, like a Man Thunderstruck, for
six, seven, eight, or twelve hours, without Speech.

6. Perceiving also a great pain in his Head, as if his Brain were tied with a
strong binding, moreover he felt a vehement heat and burning throughout the
whole Body, which did show his feverish disposition, he perceived this heat to
arise first about the Region of the left Hypochondria, from whence Vapors
effumating, imbued with an evil quality, became the Authors of so great a
mischief.

7. Now, it will seem very consentaneous to Reason, for the better mastering of
this Disease to evacuate those vicious Humors, to open Obstructions, and to
repel the Malignities.

8. And to that end, several purgative Medicines were used by some famous
Physicians, to eradicate this Distemper, but all in vain.

9. I tried the opening of a Vein in the left Arm, and the Splenetick Vein
being opened, it afforded him no small relief; for from thence a fiery kind of
vapor was subtracted, which seemed to stick to the left Hypochondria.

10: When I saw this Disease would not yield to so great a force of various
Medicaments, then I concluded this affect to have some relation, if not an
Identity with an Epidemical Disease of Hassia called in High Dutch Die
Kirbelsucht, proceeding from the corruption of the serous juice with the
choleric humor and other mixed humors, complicated with the Convulsive
motions.

11. From whence I directed the Scope of my Cure, toward the destroying that
malignant poisonous humor, in which I had very happily a salutiferous success
and event.

12. Take swallow-wort, Devils-bit, Elecampane, Male-peony, gathered in the
decrease of the Moon (but I rather think in her increase;) Cloves, of each a
dram and half: Bay berries, half a dram: flowers of Rosemary, Sage, Thyme, of
each fifteen grains: species Plirisarchonticon, Diamoschi dulcis, Dianthos, of
each half a scruple; mix and make a powder: of which one dram is to be given at
a time; in Peony and black Cherry-water, of each an ounce and a half.

13. I could scarcely persuade, or force the Sick to take this Powder, both
nauseating of it, and being of a suspicious or diffident humor, after the
manner of such as are Melancholy. At length he was prevailed with, and he took
it, lying in his bed all day till night, without Speaking, his Eyes shut, much
like to one astonished or amazed.

14. When I went to see him, I enquired concerning the success of the
Medicament, he Answered, that he felt only a hard binding or squeezing of his
Head, which continued for some hours, as if the whole substance of the Brain
would burst forth, by his Eyes, Nose, and Ears: Or, as if his Head was
compressed or bound together with Cords.

15. I persuaded him to continue the use of this Powder for some Mornings; for
as an old Oak is not to be removed by one blow, so a radicated Disease is not
to be overcome by once taking of a Medicament; but it is to be withstood by our
whole strength.

16. So neither can one Dose of the said Powder, having an Alexiterian force
prove, so miraculously effectual, unless all the Symptoms were so overcome and
profligated, as never to return any more. There are some few, who look up unto
God; and to his hidden Divine Power for the healing of their Distempers, all
others endeavor in vain, what Medicaments soever they use. Thonerus, Lib. 2.
Observe. 1.

XC. The Falling Sickness with a Bastard Palsy.

1. A certain noble person, about the age of thirty five, had such an
indisposition of the Stomach, as that he could not digest his Food well, he was
troubled with Eructuations or Belchings, with a disposition and offers of
Vomiting, a pain of the Stomach and a loathing; whom a violent Cholick also
siezed, with a black Jaundice, Epileptick Convulsions, and a painful Palsy both
of the Hands and Feet.

2. Afterward the Crudities of his Stomach, the flatulent Hypochondriack
affection, the obstructions of the Belly, and the pains of his Joints
increasing, his Animal, Vital and Natural Powers were chiefly hurt.

3. At length a Tenesmus, or a desire to go to Stool, with the exulceration of
the Intestinum Rectum, or Arse-Gut, toward the end continue still as yet to
afflict him.

4. Now a Prognostic being made, it may be concluded, that the hurt is very
grievious and great, because of the operations of diverse principal parts
governing the whole, and that it was diurnal, because of the continuation of
the Cause, and also that the Disease would be with difficulty perfectly cured,
because of the resistance of the morbifick Cause, Nature being debilitated, and
so not capable of helping and increasing the efficacy of the Medicaments,
besides the imbecility of the Members, which appears enough in those
contracted and resolved parts.

5. Yet nevertheless, there is no Cause for Despair, seeing because of age; the
Nature of the whole Compositum seems strong and lively.

6. Afterward, we must have respect to the Indication; as first, that the
peccant matter about the Vessels of the Concoction be prepared by degrees:
secondly, being prepared, that it be evacuated by turns: thirdly, that Care be
taken to prevent the generation of new matter: fourthly, that being translated
to the habit of the Body, it be assuaged, softened and discussed: fifthly, that
the grievious Symptoms may be corrected, as much as is possible.

7. For the first and second, other Physicians (for I was not called from the
beginning) did endeavor by various Medicines both to attenuate the peccant
matter, and being prepared to evacuate it, as well by the inferior as the
superior parts, not suddenly nor all at once, because Nature being weak could
not otherwise undergo this Course, or that it being contumacious and obstinate,
would not at the first yield.

8. For the third, these things did teach how to prevent the generation of new
Matter, which were enjoined in respect of daily Diet, and the Laxation of the
Belly against Hypochondriack Symptoms, thither also belongs all corroberatives
as well as those designed and dedicated to the natural, as those appointed and
designed to the Vital and Animal Faculties.

9. For the fourth, among many things for the discussion of the peccant humor,
lurking in the musculous habit with the membranous and nervous parts, the use
of Baths are mightily commended.

10. For the fifth, there was nothing omitted for strengthening the Brain and
Spinal Marrow, because of the Convulsive Motions, and for resolving and
discussing of Winds in the Hypochondriack affection, and abating and
diminishing all Obstructions of the Belly; and another exercise of the Baths
was continued.

11. Now, because the present help was expected, we shall have some respect to
these latter and posteriour Indications; first, that the matter or the
antecedent Cause be not gathered anew: secondly, that the Members subservient
to the natural Faculty most easily receiving the afflux of the matter may be
strengthened: thirdly, that the matter, harming the hurt parts may be
discussed, as much as is possible to be done without the hurting of the
Faculties: fourthly and lastly, that the separate and distinct affect of the
Arse-Gut be not any ways neglected.

12. Now as to first of these; when the natural Faculties do pretty well
discharge their office in the business of Concoction, we must see that they be
not clogged, either with the inconvenient and improper qualities, or the
excessive and immoderate quantity of Meat and Drink.

13. The convenient and agreeable qualities agree in this, that the several
Foods be easy of Concoction, and that they be more moist in the act, than dry,
because of the Inclination to diurnal Obstructions of the Belly.

14. Whatever does evaporate up to the Head must be laid aside, such as Onions,
Radishes, Wormwood, and the like, it should rather be shut up with these
things, which by their temperate quantitys are amicable and friendly to the
Brain, and help the Nerves, as Sage, Rosemary, Marjoram, Thyme, Nutmeg,
Cinnamon, etc.

15. Wine, although generous, is very inconvenient, because by its penetrating
Virtue, it is inimical to the original of the Nerves and the Head, neither
rough nor crude, because it does not a little increase the excrementitious
matter about the Vessels of Concoction; but pleasant and mild, such as has the
taste of Muskadel, or somewhat more noble than the rest, may be made use of by
infusing therein the roots of Elecampane, Avens, Betony, Rosemary, Sage, and
the like.

16. Make use of Beer but sparingly, seeing it generates Wind, unless it be
pure and clean from all dregs, it must not be either too new nor too old, into
which infuse Hearts tongue, Ceterach, Rosemary, Spleen-wort, Sage, roots of
Peony, Elecampane, Carduus; also Hydromel, as it may be prepared about the
Canicular days; in the place of Beer you may use the Decoction of Sassafras,
with Fennel and Raisons prepared with Wine.

17. As to the quantity of Food, great Care must be had, that there be not too
much satiety and glutting, nor too much variety; Nature which is weak in
Concoction, being content with a little, the like Care is necessary in respect
of drink.

18. After a strict and punctual observation of Diet, both as to Meat and
Drink, you must take heed, that there be no new gathering or collection of the
peccant matter about the Vessels of Concoction.

19. For which purpose the Belly must be kept every day loose and lax enough,
whose office may be excited either by a laxative splenetick Wine, or by the
Whey of Goats Milk boiled with Fumitory, or by one ounce and half of Manna
taken in the Syrup of Prunes, or by the following Electuary of Mej^rus.

20. Take choice Turbith, Mechoacan, of each two drams and half: Hermodactyls,
four drams: Sena, six drams: Diagrydium, one scruple and half: Aniseeds,
Ginger, of each two scruples: Mace, one scruple: sal Gem, half a scruple: make
a very fine powder.

21. Take Damask Prunes, one pound: Jujubes stoned, Raisons of the sun, of each
half a pound: boil them in a sufficient quantity of water to a pulp, pulp it
through a sieve rubbing it; mix one pound of the pulp with two ounces of sugar,
and two ounces of the abovementioned powder, the quantity of the Dose, more or
less than a Wall-nut.

22. First, every month about the last quarter of the Moon, a larger evacuation
may be instituted of two scruples of the Extractum Panchymagogum Crollij, for
four days together twice a day, the Cream of Tartar rightly prepared, with the
Broth of flesh, taken two hours before Meat.

23. But it will be very convenient after the Canicular days, before the use of
the Extract, to take fasting for the space of eight days somewhat distilled of
Splenetick Herbs, such as Fumitory, Brook-lime, Watercresses, done with
clarifyed Whey.

24. The affections of the Mind are to be moderated, as Anger, and such like
Passions, for the Blood being stirred by them, does much heighten the Disease,
Venus, that Enemy to the Nerves and Brain, must be seldom used.

25. As to the second, that the Members subservient to the Animal Faculty may
be strengthened, we endeavored that no Medicaments externally or internally to
be applied, should be neglected: first, inwardly, the Balsam of Fennel made of
the Oil, Tincture and Salt of the same is proper: as also Rouls of the Species
of Diamoschu dulcis, with the Oil of Nutmeg by expression, Confected with Sugar
dissolved in the water of Lillies: the spirit or Water of Lillies of the
Valleys, diverse times rectifyed, Ambegrise, 3 grains, taken in the Morning; the
Confection of Aniseed with Ambergrise prepared, the Apoplectick water distilled
with Castoreum, and the like.

26. Outwardly, a frequent Fume, with the following Powder: Take Gum
Tacamahacca, one dram and half: Mastich, Olibanum, Benjamin, of each half an
ounce: the Manna of Frankincense, two drams: the Wood of the root of Juniper,
four scruples: make a gross powder for a Fume.

27. Let a Pill be made and often taken with the species corroberating the
Head: rub frequently the Members affected, first the Back and Joints with
Swallows-waters distilled with Castoreum warm.

28. As to the third, it is not to be doubted, but that the use of Bathing is
convenient; for thereby the superfluous matter is ratifyed and expurgated, and
the nervous parts corroberated.

29. But the benefit of such may be the greater and the more perceptible; if
first, there be exhibited every day, for a Week or two, the Decoction or
fomentation together with the application of the following Liniment and Plaster.

30. Take the roots of Marshmallows, Bryony, White Lillies, of each one ounce
and half: the leaves of Sage and Thyme, of each one pugil: the flowers of
Camomil, the tops of Melilot, of each one handful and half: Line-seed and
Foenugreek, of each half an ounce: make a Decoction in broth of the Head and
Feet of Calves or of Sheep: let the parts afflicted be Bathed in this Decoction.

31. Presently after anoint them with the following Ointment, which done, apply
this Plaster: Take Oil of Earthworms, white Lillies, of each one ounce:
Wall-flowers, flower-de-luce, of each two drams: Gum Amoniacum, half an ounce:
Turpentine, a sufficient quantity: make an Ointment.

32. Take Gum Amoniacum, half an ounce: Galbanum, Opopanax, Bdellium, of each
two drams: dissolve them in Aqua Vitae, or the spirit of the best Juniper, add
the Marrow of a Calves legs, Mans-grease, of each half an ounce: common Rosin,
a sufficient quantity: make a Plaster.

33. As to the fourth, we are not of the opinion, That the affect in the
Intestinum Rectum, or Arse-Gut does principally proceed from the precedent
Causes of the Disease, but rather think the original thereof to be some
external Cause, the frequent use of Suppositories, or somewhat else.

34. The Chyrurgian in searching, did observe the exulceration, not to lie in
the Sphincter, but a little higher in the left side of the Intestinum Rectum,
that part above others being swelled to the bickness of a Filbert nut, and the
pain to arise from the Compression of the same.

35. Although the exulceration causing a Tenesmus was not great, yet it is not
to be wondered at, that it should prove difficult in Cure; for it being in that
part which is endowed with a more lively sense and feeling, cannot endure sharp
Medicaments; which also because of its hot moist nature, is inclinable to
Corruption and Putrefaction, into which all the Veins end and concenter, and
all the Excrements of the Belly flow thither, which hinder that Consolidation.

36. Medicines that are cleansing and consolidating, without any sharpness or
biting were required, such as Barley-water chalybeated, mixed with the Honey of
Roses, or Plantane, or the leaves of Oak boiled in the Decoction of Barley, or
a little Nitre prepared being added, or the following Decoction.

37. Take whole Barley, two pugils: Lignum Guajacum, an ounce: the leaves of
Plantan, Mullein, of each half an handful: boil them in Bean-water; strain,
then add clarifyed Honey of Roses, Diamoron, of each one ounce and half: mix
them.

38. These cleansing Medicines being given, there may be added immediately
something which is of a lenitive and consolidating quality, if the pain be
again stirred up or provoked; as are the Oleum Hyperici simplex, mingled with
an equal quantity of the Oil of Eggs, and other like things, as shall seem most
expedient to the Physician.

39. These Medicines we advised for this vehement fierce D^sease, by which
together with Gods Blessing she (as yet living amongst us) was freed from this
and other bad Symptoms. Horstius, Tom. 2. Lib. 2. Observe. 15.

XCI. The Falling Sickness not proceeding from Vapors only; but also from
plenty of humors in the Cavities of the Brain.

1. A worthy Gentleman living in Stiria, was so much wasted and consumed by an
Hectic Fever, that there was nothing left besides skin and Bones, at length
the Epileptick Convulsions, by putting an end to his uncomfortable wretched
Life, afforded him a quietus est.

2. His fits were upon him almost day and night, continuing without any
Intermission above two days together.

3. I was astonished to behold how while nature lay prostrate and vanquished,
this person could sustain such a concourse of firce and violent symptoms for so
long a time.

4. It was observed, That the matter did descend from the Head very often by
the Jaws into the Oesophagus, which he was forced to swallow sometimes: being
cast out of the Mouth, it appeared to be of a greenish and blackish color.

5. From thence it was very perspicuous that those corrupt humors mixed with
Choler and Melancholy, were both the parent and nurse of this malady.

6. Here no small Controversy might arise, as, whether the Epileptick Paroxysms
did proceed from the vapors only, or from the humors repleting and filling the
Ventricles of the Brain.

7. Without doubt they oftenest come from these Malignant vapors, pricking
forward the Expulsive faculty; because that the Cavities of the Brain, have
been replet with an abundance of Corrupt humors, of which this is a notable
sign whilst the Sick frequently is forced to swallow down the matter, which
nevertheless does not excite that disaffection by reason of the obstructions of
the said Ventricles, but rather because of a Malignant, Inimical quality
wherewith being infected, they do Irritate the membranes of the Brain.
Augustinus Thonerus, lib. 2. Observe. 2.

XCII. An Epilepsy with a Cholick: wherein all things appeared as double.

1. A reverend Father, of a Melancholy disposition, strong in Body, keeping no
good Diet, was afflicted with a violent Cholick, tormenting the Bowels with a
mighty Compression, at length the morbifick matter was carried into the Brain,
which terminated in Epileptick Convulsions.

2. Being somewhat eased of his Pain, and walking about for some weeks, he
began to Eat, no more complaining of any symptom but that all things he looked
on, did appear to him as they were double; one or the other of the C^ystilline
humors being removed out of its seat, and by the Convulsions either attracted
upwards or drawn downwards; this was worthy of Admiration and Commiseration.

3. If any body did at any time stretch out their Hand to him, then he thought
he did see a double Hand, being doubtful which of them he should lay hold on;
the like happened when he was about taking of Meat out of a dish, or in putting
the Cup to his Mouth.

4. This symptom troubling him for the space of a month, at length retired, but
his health proved very uncertain; For within fourteen days the Epileptick fits,
unexpectedly returned, and began to trouble this good Father, afflicting him
day and night, and never left him till his last minute.

5. Also this Gentleman much like to him aforementioned, was forced to swallow
down the greenish and black matter descending from the Brain by the palate, to
the Mouth, which although sometimes it was ejected by the Mouth, yet at length
was thereby suffocated.

6. When he was first taken with the Colic, purgatives were Exhibited; but
necessity required Opiats.

7. Take Laudanum Opiate with magisteries, four grains one pugil: there being a
great loss of Appetite, and an aversation to all sorts of meats, It was
prescribed as follows: Take the waters of Bugloss and Borage, of each three
ounces: Rose Water, two ounces and half: waters of Tile-flowers, and
black-Cherry, of Lillies of the Valleys, and of Cinnamon, of each one dram and
half: Lozenges of sugar pearled, one ounce: mix them.

8. He was for some weeks comforted by these waters, the greenish matter being
by them in some measure carried off. Thonerius, lib. 2. Observe. 3.

XCIII. An Epilepsy with a Colic proceeding from corrupt and stinking humors.

1. A certain Gentleman of the upper Styria, of a Melancholy nature being
infested with vehement fierce fits of the Colic, and I being called to attend
upon him; before I could come, fits of the Epilepsy seized him, insomuch that
there was great danger of his life.

2. And being passionatly entreated both by him and his Wife not to leave him,
but to administer all things which might concur toward his ease and recovery;
now his Body being first well purged, I did propose next Decoctum Ligni sancti,
with sarsa parilla, of which he found great good.

3. From his sweating Drink a great quantity of stinking loathsome Sweat did
evaporate, insomuch that when he had done Sweating, and his bed was uncovered
and thrown open, the standers by could not endure the stench, which was an
Indubitable argument of the Corruption of the humors.

4. I stayed with him about a month; and at length I went away, (my Counsel
being required by others that were in valetudinarie) leaving behind me an
honorable remembrance of my self. Thonerus lib. 2. Observe. 4.

XCIV. The Falling Sickness in a young Man, having many fits in a day.

1. One Nicholas Hazard a young man, about twenty six years of Age (a person of
a moist Brain but otherwise Plethorick) had strong fits every week; three
times, and very often five times a day; which held him for the space of one,
sometimes two hours, with a foaming of the Mouth, shreiking out, a hurting of
all the senses; and a long and profound sleep following.

2. I used no other Medicine (besides blood-letting, directed for particular
reasons, not in respect to the Falling Sickness) than the following purging
Electuary: by the taking of which he was cured in the seventh month, observing
also a most accurate Diet; from which Disease he has now lived free these ten
years.

3. The purging Electuary: Take Electuary of the juice of Roses, an ounce:
powder of Jallap, a dram: spirit of Salt rectified a scruple: Oil of Rosemary,
eight drops: mix it and make it into a soft Electuary: Of this the Sick may
take the quantity of a Nutmeg, three or four times in a week (but I think every
morning fasting would be much better.)

4. Deckers commenting upon this Recipe, says, That rather than Spirit of
Salt; that Spirit of Sal Aromoniack ought to be taken; Or some other Oily
Volatile salt; or one scruple of the distilled Spirit of these two mixed, and
joined by two or three Cohobations. Barbet Prax. lib. 1. cap. 1. Observe. 1.

XCV. Epileptick motions in a young Woman.

1. The Daughter of Simon Gomes de Pas, aged twenty years, was troubled a year
with Epileptick motions; which held her from the seventh hour in the morning,
till the ninth in the evening, with a foaming at the Mouth, without Speech, or
the manifest use of her senses.

2. Her monthly Terms did, notwithstanding, observe their due manner and time:
in the night she did speak, eat, and drink, but it was sparingly; I prescribed
to her the following Pills.

3. Take Castoreum, salt of Mugwort, of each four grains: resine of Jallap, six
grains: fine Aloes, nine grains: Oil of sweet Marjoram, two drops: mix and make
five pills for one dose: with these she was well purged.

4. Twice a day she took this following draught: Take of the whitest spanish
Soap, half a dram: boil it in Cows milk; and let the Sick take a quarter of a
pint of the straining.

5. It is wonderful that by taking of this Medicine, the fit should be every
day by degrees so lessened, that at the thirtieth day, she was perfectly cured;
and so continued well. In persons Phlegmatic, I use not Phlebotomy. Barbet
prax. lib. 1. cap. 1. Observe. 2.

XCVI. The Falling Sickness in a Melancholy man.

1. A man of about forty five years of Age, of a Melancholy disposition, but
especially about the fit, every week about the full moon, perceiving only a
dizziness, fell down, and then was lamentably afflicted with mighty Convulsions
and Convulsive motions, which continued for the space of three or four hours,
forgetting two or three days following whatever was done, except his dizziness.

2. Then having many troublesome nights with horrid Dreams, he always awaked
with a fright, every part of him shaking, and having also lost his Memory, lay
with his Hand, very much trembling.

3. Blood-letting was often used by the direction of a certain Physician,
sometimes to take away the Paroxysm, and sometimes for the Disease it self but
without success.

4. The Wife of the sick person for taking away the fit, which could not be
overcome, nor taken away by Phlebotomy, put into her Husbands mouth Cloves
chewed, or bruised; by which the fit was profligated.

5. I being called to the Cure prescribed the following things; all sharp, four
and raw things being forbidden: first, take of the waters of Betony, and line
tree flowers, of each two ounces: Eennell water, Aqua vitae of Matthiolus, the
Antepileptick water of Langius, of each one ounce: the Spirit of salt
Armoniack, half a dram: Ticture of Castor, ten drops: flowers of St. John's
wort, one dram: Laudanum opiatum, four grains: Oil of Amber, five drops: syrup
of Staechas, one ounce: mix them, of this he took four times at the least every
day one or two spoonful.

6. Secondly, once every week he took for a dose five of the following pills,
by which he had three or four stools: Take of the gum Ammoniacum dissolved in
Rose Water, half a dram: the best Myrrh, the Rozin of Jalap, Scammony, Vitriol
of Mars calcined to a whiteness, of each one scruple: Saffron, half a scruple:
Oil of Amber, eight drops: mix them, and make gilded pills in number forty, and
sprinkle them with the powder of Cinnamon etc.

7. Thirdly, he took the following powder every evening with Sack: Take of red
Coral prepared, and of white Chalk; of each one scruple: sugar Candy, three
drams: mix them and make a very fine powder, to be divided into six doses.

8. In the evening this powder being taken, the morning following, he had three
or four stools: We continued the use of these Medicines about a fortnight.

9. And then, Fourthly, I prescribed the following Physical wine: Take of the
roots of Enula Campana, sweet garden flag, wood Valerian, of each two drams:
Misletoe of the Oak, an ounce: the leaves of Sage, Hyssop, of each an handful:
the seeds of Peony, sweet Fennel, of each two drams: Cinnamon, three drams:
Nutmegs, one dram: Orange-peel, two drams: the Ingredients being cut and
bruised, let them be grossly sowed up in a Bag, and put into a stone Vessel,
upon which pour four pints of Canary, not french wine nor Rhenish, because they
increase the acid humor.

10. After a due Infusion he took three ounces of it three times a day, twelve
drops of salt-Armoniack being first dropped into evey dose, and we continued the
use of the said Physical wine to the end of the Cure, the above mentioned
pills, as also the mixture being repeated about the Full and New of the moon.

11. Fifthly, the day before and the day after the New and Full moon, as also
in the New and Full moon if self, he took in the evening with his Physical wine
a dose of the following powder: Take of Vermilion, of Antimony, twelve grains,
Elks-claw, one scruple: magistery of Coral and Pearl, of each eighteen grains:
mix them, and make a very fine powder for three doses.

12. By these Medicines and the blessing of the great God his Melancholy was
wholly removed, his Memory perfectly restored, and the trembling of his Hands
cured; neither was the Patient any more afflicted with his fits.

13. By this method, a few things altered, certain Antihysterical Medicines
only being added, we have cured two Damsels, one about two and twenty years of
Age, very Melancholy and troubled with vehement fits every two or three days,
accompanied with a Hypocondriack Suffocation, her Hands being shut by
Convulsive motions.

14. Another of about nineteen years, being Phlegmatic, laboring also with a
supprespresion of her Terms, and troubled almost every night with Epileptick
motions, by the blessing of God we have cured.

15. As also we perfectly restored a young Man of twenty five years, he was

Liquor, is powerful in curing the Falling Sickness. Cooks Marrow of Physic,

XCVIII. Out of Horstius against the Epilepsy.

1. Take Galbanum, what quantity you please; hold to the Nose and smell often
to it: it is profitable against the Invasion of the Paroxysm and sometimes
prevents it.

2. Take Rue, bruise it with Vinegar and apply it to the Nostrils, Wrists and
Temples; it is not only good in the fit, but oftentimes prevents the accession
of a new-fit; the same thing does Powder of Castor and Saffron mixed with sharp
Vinegar, being applied, the Fumes also of Rue received up the Nostrils, being
laid upon a red hot Tile or Brick, do much good.

3. Take Angelica-water, and Lavender-Water, of each two spoonfuls; give it in
the time of the Fit, or every Morning fasting for prevention.

4. Take Sperma Ceti, pure and white, three or four grains; give it with Syrup

evacuation having gone before, let the Sick often drink a Decoction of Camomil
flowers made in Vinegar, and sweetened with Honey.

Peony-flowers is of good use; also Syrup of Peony-flowers, mixed with half part
of syrup of Violets vitriolated, and given by spoonfuls, is of good use.

Aromaticus, an ounce and half: mix them for a Lohoch: Dose two drams, or more

them, against Obstructions in the Epilepsy and Apoplexy.

15. Take syrup of the juice of Succory with Rhubarb, two spoonfuls: let it be
often given for prevention of the fits.

16. The roots and seeds of Peony, taken and applied to the Pulses are good
against the Epilepsy; so also the Decoction of the roots of Male-peony,
sweetened with Syrup of Stoechas being drunk, is very powerful in this Case; the
seeds also do the same thing, and are less nauseous.

17. Take powder of Male-peony roots, Emeralds of Man's skull prepared, of each
a like quantity; mix them together: it is a powerful remedy; if to this powder,
you add powder of Castoreum; it not only powerfully roots out the Epilepsy but
the Apoplexy also.

18. Take Lavender-water, an ounce and half: Water of the Tile-tree, five
ounces: mix them: it Cures the Falling Sickness in Infants: the Oil of Lavender

Convulsions proceeding from cold, warms the part, and prevails against the
Falling Sickness: Vinegar of squills, is commended by almost all Physicians,
and the Powder may be given in it.

21. Horstius, also commends the Decoction of Carduus Benedictus, to be taken
every Morning and Evening, as a mighty thing against the Epilepsy and Apoplexy:
but much more powerful if it be made with good Wine, and it is yet more
effectual, if a dram of the Powder of the Herb be given at a time with the said
Decoction; this he not only highly commends against the Falling Sickness, but
also against all Quartan Agues and yellow Jaundice, and that is Optimum
Remedium contra Vermes, the greatest Medicine that is to kill Worms.

22. Wine of black Cherries is often to be drunk for the Falling Sickness; for
it comforts the Stomach and Nerves, and if Lavender and Rosemary-flowers be
infused into it, it will yet be more powerful. Gregorius Horstius, Tom. 3. etc.

night going to Bed three large spoonfuls or two ounces; when she had followed
these Directions for a Week together the Convulsion totally intermitted and
never returned again. Martinus Rulandus, Cent. 10. Cur. 95.

CXXVI. A Man Epileptick afflicted with the Stone.

1. This Man being near forty years of Age, and for above ten or twelve years
past, much afflicted with the Stone in the Bladder, was at length siezed with
the Falling Sickness. The first Fit took him about the beginning of May, the
second Fit near the latter end of the same Months; afterward the Fits followed
him for a while once a Week, and at length he fell with them every day.

2. He tried several Physicians without any remedy; at length he came to me; he
complained to me of both his Distempers, nor could he tell which afflicted him
most, but desired my help against them both: and by reason his Body was very
apt to be bound, I caused it to be kept open, sometimes with Diacatholicon, and
sometimes with stewed Prunes prepared with Sena.

3. Then I ordered this following Bolus to be taken every night going to bed:
Take Balsam of Peru, three ounces: powder of Man's skull, six drams: salt of
Hartshorn, Misleto of the Oak, Peony-seeds in powder, of each three drams: mix
and make an Electuary. Dose from one dram to half an ounce, increasing the dose
gradually: this was taken for about nine or ten months without intermission.

4. Every Morning fasting, the following Potion was given: Take Rhenish Wine,
four pound: Onions shred small, six ounces: infuse all for forty hours, then
squeeze hard out to the expressed Liquor, add distilled Water of Onions, one
pound and half: salt of Man's skull, one ounce; mix them: Dose five or six
spoonfuls every Morning fasting, or somewhat more, increasing the Dose also, as
the Patient can bear it.

5. After this had been taken for a month; the following was given for a month
longer: Take Oil of Juniper Berries, from twenty drops to thirty: juice of
Limons, two spoonfuls: mix the Oil first with a little white Sugar, then with
the juice of Limons, and so let him take it, drinking after it a little draught
of Water distilled from biting Arsmart, or from Onions.

6. And every day an hour before Dinner about ten ounces of the following
mixture was given him: Take simple water of Juniper Berries, simple distilled
waters of biting Arsmart, and of Onions, of each a like quantity; mix them, to
which add at time of giving (to every dose) two drams or more of the Volatile
and Antepileptick spirit of Vitriol.

7. Once also every Week and sometimes oftener, I purged his Head with proper
Errhines, by which a vast quantity of Water and purulent Excrements were drawn
from thg Brain: this was commonly done at night going to bed, that he might not
take cold by immediate going into the Air: and by the constant use of these
Medicines this Patient was perfectly cured of his Disease: however after the
first Month, I ordered him for his constant drink a small Decoction of
Guajacum, in which a small quantity of Mustard Seed and Horse Radish roots were
infused. Ex MSS. R. Turneri, Observe. 127.

CXXVII. The Falling Sickness with other Symptoms.

1. A Gentlewoman about 20 years of Age, was afflicted every day with
Suffocation and Swo^ning which degenerated into a Delirium and Convulsion of
the whole Body; afterward there was some mitigations of those Symptoms; yet
they continued sometimes for the space of fifteen days.

2. She was also troubled with a most grievious and sharp pains in her
Arteries, insomuch, that she was constrained to cry out bitterly; and if
sometimes there appeared any intermission of her pains; yet she was oppressed
by Melancholy, and became so lean, that she looked not much better than an
Anatomy, being of a very wane palish color, as if she had been laboring under
the Green Sickness.

3. She remained in this Condition without Cure for the space of four or five
years, at length all the Physicians of Thoulouze were convocated to have a
Consultation for her Cure; but they looking on her Condition as desperate,
committed her Cure to time, her native Air and the care of her Parents; hoping
that by those means she might recover.

4. Notwithstanding, she continued under her former Circumstances for many
years; and those Symptoms getting ground and growing every day more and more
vigorous; at last all means being dispaired of, I was called upon: and I asked
what Medicines the Doctors of Tholouze had prescribed her, which I found to be
these, Clysters breaking Wind, and emollient Clysters, Apozems, Juleps; things
provoking her Courses, Baths, Ointments, Emplasters, Embrocations; and many
other Prescriptions, which I willingly pass by, least I should prove tedious.

5. Now, when that I had considered, this Disease could not be cured by Galens
method; but was rather in danger of being made worse; I attempted the Spagyrick
way of Cure.

6. First of all, I enquired what kind of Diet she had used all her Life long,
and I found that she had always drunk Water, and did abhor all flesh Meat and
the Broth of Flesh; and did eat all manner of Fruits, Eggs made ready with
Bread, Oil and Herbs; wherefore I altered the whole Course of her Diet;
prescribing her to accustom her self by little and to drink Wine, till she
could drink it pure without mixture; the Course of her Diet was hot and moist.

7. Afterward, I prescribed the salt of Vitriol dissolved in Mugwort-water, to
the quantity of one dram in one ounce of the said Water.

8. So great was the Virtue of this Medicament, that there was almost a Recess
of all the Symptoms; she did Vomit up an abundance of phlegmatic humors
greenish and yellowish; by this Medicament alone, and a Bath of Wine with
Tartar, she was perfectly cured in the space of eight days.

9. Of which benefit being always mindful; she at last bestowed her self, and
all her Riches upon me, as a Reward of my great Care and Cure; by whom living,
as yet, I have many goodly Children. Petrus Johannes Faber, Cur. 11.

CXXVIII. The Falling Sickness.

1. A Laboring Man of my Brothers, whilst he was warming him before the Fire;
fell to the ground (my Brother and I being present) without sense, trembling,
crying out, and foaming at the Mouth, to whom we gave immediately Aqua
Imperialis with the green spirit of Vitriol; by which he did presently rise,
and was freed from the Epileptick assault.

2. But within three or four hours after the fit returned; from which he was
delivered by the like Medicament, to wit, my salt of Vitriol, it purging him by
Vomit for a whole day, and he was for a long time freed from the Paroxysm,
which used to afflict every third hour.

3. Afterward we purged him the next day with our Antimony, and for eight days
together, he did use the Essence of white Amber, with the green spirit of
Vitriol, in Cinnamon Water to a small quantity; and by these few Medicaments
this young Man was perfectly cured of the Epilepsy, with which he had been
afflicted from his Mothers Womb. Petrus Johannes Faber, Cur. 42.

CXXIX. An Epilepsy, with a vehement Obstruction of the Lungs.

1. It was in a Youth which for five or six years had been mightily troubled
with the Falling Sickness, having for so long time used the advice of
Physicians without any hope of Remedy: at length by reason of a Fall had a
bruise upon his Side and Back, from whence came a great difficulty of
Breathing, sometimes to the endangering the stopping of his Breath.

2. The Disease increasing upon him, (he receiving no benefit by any thing
given by his Physicians) he became not only Hoarse, but breathed with a rattling
Noise in his Throat and Breast, and complained that his Stomach was mightily
swelled within, to his apprehension, as if he should burst, and therefore
earnestly desired that his Breast and Stomach might be suddenly emptied, without
which he must necessarily dye.

3. At length I being called, perceived where the young Man's grief lay, and how
that by reason of a great Obstruction of the Lungs, there was present danger of
Suffocation: I forthwith ordered the following things: Take Rhenish Wine, a
quart: dissolve in it an ounce of the pure juice of spanish Liquorice, by
receiving only its rubicund Tincture; in this Tincture dissolve Volatile salts
of Hartshorn and Man's skull, of each half an ounce: Dose one ounce, more or
less, in a glass of Canary; putting into it at time of taking, eight, ten, or
twelve drops of spirit of sal Armoniack, or as many drops as the Sick could
well endure to swallow it withal: and this to be taken four or five times a day.

4. After three or four days the danger of Death by Suffocation was over, then
I ordered this following Vomit: Take Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, half an
ounce: salt of Vitriol, one scruple: mix them. This was given in the Morning
fasting, by which he had six easy Vomits and eight Stools, I repeated it twice
more at four days distance: by means of which three several Emetick Doses and
the continuation of the former prescript, the miserable sick Patient was
perfectly cured, not only of his Suffocative Obstruction of the Lungs, but also
of his Falling Sickness. Ex MSS. R. Turneri, Obs. 130.

CXXX. The Falling Sickness.

1. A Barbers Wife in Bedford-shire being afflicted therewith every Change of
the Moon, was preserved by taking each day three drops of Oleum Heraclei with
the Extract of Peony.

2. Or the Cure of this Disease may be thus performed: first, you shall purge
your Patient with the Extract of Helleborus niger; the Dose whereof is from
eight grains to twelve, being before well Corrected, and then drank in some
convenient Liquor or Potion.

3. This being done, he gave his Patient Morning and Evening of this
Composition; which the longer it is used, the better it will be for him: Take
the Essence of Peony, Conserve of Rosemary-flowers, and of Betony, as much as
you please; mix them together in form of an Electuary: then add thereto for
every ounce of that Compositum, one scruple of Man's skull, and half a scruple
of the Oil of Rosemary-flowers, with twelve drops of the Oil of Vitriol; hereof
let him take half an ounce at a time, either by it self, or with some
convenient Liquor, Broth or Potion.

4. Also the nape of the Neck must be anointed with the Oil of Castoreum, when
the person falls, you shall anoint their Nostrils with the Oil of Amber; for
that will in a very short time recover them again; it will be also expedient to
use those things that Comfort the Brain and the Heart. Anonymus.

CXXXI. The Falling Sickness.

1. Against the Falling Sickness, I have often given the juice of the Herb
called Lanceola, (which is Herba Vernalis, or the less Plantain called
Rib-wort) with an empty Stomach, for the space of thirty days, mixing it with
the Gelly of the shavings of Ivory, and the Blood of a Pigeon, (for the Man the
Male, for the Woman the Female) in the Essence or Oil of Man's Skull. Paracelsus.

2. I often cured the Falling Sickness with Essentia veratri nigri, prepared by
our order. Paracelsus.

3. A certain Woman was troubled with the Falling Sickness, in whose Nose I put
the Oil of Gagates, and in a short time she recovered again, then I purged her
with our Hellebor, and the next day, I gave her some drops of the Oil of Man's
skull, who afterward was not any more afflicted with this Disease. Paracelsus.

CXXXII. The Epilepsy proceeding from a sudden fright.

1. A young Man about twenty years of age, did complain of the pain of the
Stomach and Bowels; he had also the Falling Sickness.

2. His Mother hearing, That the Sick might be freed from it, if any unknown to
the Sick person, or never seen by him, at least since he was thus afflicted,
should suddenly and by way of surprise affright and terrify him, she instantly
called a Maid of hers, bidding her to go to him, and tell him, that he must
instantly prepare for being Sacrificed, and that an Instrument was made ready
for that purpose to cut him in the middle in two pieces.

3. This being done, the Epileptick person was struck with such dread and
terror, that he was not for the space of fourteen days thereafter troubled with
any Fit of that Distemper.

4. His Urine was Choleric and Feverish; therefore I exhibited the following
Potion: Take Electuarium Elescoph, one ounce: the Decoction of the Flowers and
Fruits, in which it is to boil, one pint: Agarick trochiscated, a sufficient
quantity; mix, and make a Potion.

5. The middle Vein of the right Arm was opened; by the benefit of these
Remedies the abovementioned Symptoms vanished, and he became perfectly
recovered, and freed from the Falling Sickness. Gabelchoverus, Cent. 4. Obs. 23.

CXXXIII. Another Epilepsy from vehement passion.

1. A young Man, by Nature froward and pevish, upon a slight provocation, fell
into such a passion which ended in Epileptick fits; and he foamed at the Mouth.
Every time he was overcome and transported with Passion, he became Epileptick.

2. His Master consulted many Physicians, and tried diverse means, which
profited the Patient but a very little; it happened that this young Man's Master
desired him to do such a piece of Work, which he had no mind to do; but that
put him into a Passion, and this into his Fits again; insomuch, that he fell
violently to the ground, and likewise suffered a vehement Convulsion both in
his Hands and Feet.

3. His Master not being able longer to bear and dispense with the troublesome
humors of his Servant; took in his Anger a Bucket full of cold Water, and threw
upon him, whereupon he came presently to himself, and was no more troubled with
the said Disease. Gabelchoverus Cent. 4. Observe. 24.

CXXXIV. An Epilepsy in a Boy.

1. A Boy a year and three quarters old, was taken with an Epilepsy, I
prescribed to him this pleasant Potion: Take Coral, Pearl prepared, of each one
dram: Julep of Roses, two ounces: water of the flowers of the Tile-tree, six
ounces; which were immediately mixed together.

2. He was bound in his Belly by reason of a Fever, which was loosened with
the Oil of sweet Almonds, two scruples: Oil of Anise, one drop, mixed together,
and the Phlegm also was cleansed by the former.

3. The day following the Boy, was better, and not long after got four Teeth.

4. About a month after, the same Boy was grieviously taken with Epileptick
Passions, with foaming at the Mouth. I ordered him a Suppository of Honey and
Salt, by which he was losened in his Belly: renewing the use of the precedent
Potion.

5. Thence he stepped, starting sometimes and stretching out his Arms; but when
he awaked, he was taken twice or thrice with such like Startings.

6. About five of the Clock in the Morning the next day, when the Fit was over,
after this aforementioned Potion, he was ordered to take Venice Treacle, one
scruple: syrup of Violets, two drams: Water of the flowers of the Tile-tree,
one ounce: spirit of Vitriol, four drops: all mixed together; by which his Body
was made hot, and his Cheeks which before looked pale, were made red, and the
Fits left him for a season.

7. In the Evening he was cheerful; the Morning following, being all over in a
mighty Sweat, he was very well: About a month after that the Child was weaned,
and fourteen days after he was weaned he was grieviously troubled (as was said)
with the Belly-ach: he Vomited up in my presence some raw or undigested
Cherries; the Epileptick Fits immediately assaulted him, with a manifest
gnashing of his Teeth, with a various and frequent shaking of his Head, with
wresting of his Body, and with very cold Feet and Hands.

8. Take Julep of Roses, half a scruple: Venice Treacle, half an ounce: the
Water of the flowers of Tile-tree, half a pound: the waters of Male peony and
Sorrel, of each six drams: Oil of Vitriol, six drops; mix them.

9. As soon as one spoonful of that Potion was given him in that Paroxysm, that
very moment the Symptom ceased; the Boy began then to speak and ask for
something; two spoonfuls of the Julep were exhibited and reiterated, which he
took with ease and would have drunk more, if it had been given him, so that he
slept the whole Night, the next Morning, and ever after he had his perfect
Health. Binningerus, Cent. 2. Observe. 64.

CXXXV. An Epilepsy from the Womb.

1. A Gentlewoman forty years of age, of an angry melancholy Complexion, when
she was beating Hemp by extending and wresting her Arm too long, and too
violently, which accidently caused a sharp and malignant vapor to ascend,
which proceeded from the Womb to the Brain and Neck, afflicting the Nerves of
the first, second, third and fourth Conjugation; causing Convulsive Motions of
the right Eye, and Mouth, with the pain of the Fingers Hands, without the use
of the outward Senses.

2. Keeping this Course, she continually struck many of those that saw her into
terror, these Fits ended, not hurting the remembrance of what things were
past, without the least sense of grief.

3. I said it was an Epileptick motion from the Womb, wherefore prescribing the
Oil of Amber, and Hysteric Medicines, she grew perfectly well. Binningerus,
Cent. 3. Observe. 91.

CXXXVI. An Epilepsy in a Child.

1. A Noble Man's Child nine Months old was taken with some Epileptick fits, her
Belly was loose, her Mouth somewhat hot with a Fever, and want of Sleep the
whole precedent Night.

2. I judged the cause to be the breaking out of her Teeth, and the Milk waxing
sower in the Ventricle, troubled the Nerves of the supreme Ventricle.

3. I prescribed Julep of Roses, Aqua Antepileptica of Bauhin, of each half an
ounce: Water of the flowers of Tile-tree, half a dram: Hartshorn burnt, half a
scruple: red Coral prepared, half an ounce: 'twas a very pleasant and powerful
Potion; in so much that all Convulsive Motions being taken away immediately
from her, she was refreshed, sucking and drinking she slept long and quietly,
and awaking, was perfectly cured. Binningerus, Cent. 4. Observe. 35.

CXXXVII. An Epilepsy in a young Man.

1. A Country Man nineteen year old complained to me, that he was taken, the
precedent Summer, with a frail disease at uncertain times: I conjectured the
Brain to be troubled by the Sympathy of the Ventricle, which the putrid and
malignant Vapors sent up, were obnoxious to, and forced to move against Nature.

2. I gave him two doses of Emetick Wine, each containing two ounces and a
half: then afterward three drams of the following Powder, for six Morning
doses in the time of the new Moon, be taken in a convenient Vehicle.

3. Take the roots of Male-peony Valerian, Misleto of Hasle, of each two ounce:
I was told, that not long after by these he was perfectly cured. Binningerus,
Cent. 4. Observe. 49.

CXXXVIII. An Epilepsy in a Boy, etc.

1. A Boy for sixteen days together, was every day taken with an Epilepsy; most
able Physicians believed, that it was caused by the Motion of the Head: but the
more Medicines that were exhibited, the more the Motion increased, so that in
twenty four hours he had many fits, though slight ones, because there was a
small commotion of the Head with foam about the Mouth.

2. When they perceived, that the disease was not through the trouble of the
Head, but by consent from the Ventricle; they desisted and forbore tormenting
him with Medicines, and gave him only Corroboratives, so the Boy became
perfectly well. Trincavella, Lib. 5. Cons. 25.

CXXXIX. An Epilepsy in a Boy, and in a Girl.

1. A young man, in a trance, was taken with a violent Epilepsy, his Face was
red and swelled.

2. The fit lasting to the third hour, by my advice the Cephalica of the left
Arm was opened, from whence the Blood broke out so violently, that within some
hours the whole might have been extracted.

3. Immediately the fit left him, and within three days space he was made whole
without a relapse. See Rhodius, lib. 1. Observe. 64.

4. A Girl about twelve years old, was often taken with an Epilepsy.

5. But being taken with a Pleurisy, she was let Blood, and from that time, she
was never taken with an Epilepsy. See Riverius, Centur. 4. Observe. 38.

CXL. The Falling Sickness in a young Man.

1. A young Man about five and twenty years of Age, used to be taken for
several months with the Falling Sickness.

2. One of the Arteries of his Temples being let Blood by me, we were in
expectation that he would be well within four Months: but, he by drinking of
Wine familiar to him, brought the disease again upon him.

3. A man aged forty three years, was often used to be taken with Fits, working
from the Fingers end to the Forehead, of which decease giving my advice,
because he was ruddy and a drinker of Wine, I cut the Artery of his Forehead,
taking away from him above four ounces of Blood.

4. But the Vein being open, much Blood issued out: by which accidental
evacuation after many days he became well, and appeared as free from his
Distemper.

5. A very Melancholy Young Man about ten or fifteen years old, was taken with
a violent Disease for the space of ten, twenty or thirty days* with a kind of
Air or Vapor, running from the inward part of the Arm to the upper parts: but
was much eased by opening the shining Veins in his Forehead. Severinus, Med.
Eff. p. 46.

CXLI* Another young Man troubled with the Falling Sickness.

1. A young man fifteen years old was Diseased about the privy parts,
afterward when the violence of the pain fell into the left side, his Spleen
was immediately pained, and so was his Brain; which made him fall into the most
violent fits of an Epilepsy; when the Region of the Spleen was pained it siezed
upon every Finger.

2. Among many Medicines nothing was equevalent to Wine Chalibeated, or
Helleborated, by the use of which he immediately cast up so much black Choler,
that at last he came to himself. Tulpius, Observe. Lib. 1. Cap. 9.

CXLII. A Woman troubled with an Epilepsy.

1. I observed in a Woman troubled with the Epilepsy, strange shapes of Worms:
coming from Italy, she most greedily and often drank of the Water she met with
when she was thirsty.

2. The Epilepsy was most violent, with a swelling and black color of the
whole Body.

3. Antepilepticks did her no good; at length by the frequent use of my
Mercurial Pills, she avoided abundance of Worms of various colors; as soon as
they were cast out of the Body, the Epileptick Fits ceased. Bartholinus, Hist.
7. Cent. 4.

CXLIII. Of Epileptick persons, etc.

1. Commonly using the Oil of Amber in Epilepticks, Convulsives, and persons
subject to Vomiting, who being full of filthy matter by the falling of a
Catarrh into the Breast; I observed them not only odious to the Sick, but to all
that were present, being loathsome by reason of the ill savor of the matter cast
forth: whether they used anointing outwardly, and Medicines inwardly, Pills, or
any other thing:

2. Now for some years I have used the Balsam Peruvianum, with things most
beneficial for the Sick. I know Chemists now correct that, and take away the
ill savor thereof by using destillation after washing; but I found the
Medicament was much weakened with that washing, and that it gave little relief
afterward.

3. Wherefore I think it better, to use the said Balsam, or pure Syrian simple,
since we know how to destil the Oil of Amber strong without any ill savor.
Here Observat. 17.

CXLIV. A remedy for the Epilepsy.

1. The efficacy of the extracted spirit from Man's Skull, is most certain for
the Cure of an Epilepsy in a Child; if five or six drops be given, and more may
be given to those more grown in years.

2. So also the Volatile Salt, which is found in the distillation of the same
Liquor. See Reusnerus, Obs. 154. in Epis. Velschij.

SCHOLIA. The THEORY of the EPILEPSY.
By the Author W. Salmon.
CXLV. The Pathology of the Falling Sickness; and first of the Notation thereof.

1. The Names. It is called in Greek (...), in Latin, Epilepsia, Morbus
Comitalis, Morbus Sacer, Morbus Puerilis: also (...), Morbus Herculeus; and in
English, the Falling Sickness.

2. The Definition. The Falling Sickness is a convulsive Motion of the whole
Body, coming by Fits, depriving the Sick both of Reason and Sense, wherein the
whole Body is contracted: Galen calls an Epilepsy, always a Convulsion, but
improperly: For it is not a true Convulsion, but a Convulsive Motion of the
Body, wherein both all the external and internal Senses are abolished.

3. The Kinds, or Differences. First, it is either Idiopathetick or
Sympathetick, if it be Idiopathetick, the Cause is primarily in the Brain it
self; if it be sympathetick, to wit, by Consent, it is either from the Stomach,
or other Viscera, or in the extreme parts: secondly, it is either Recent, to
wit, but newly begun, or Inveterate, of long standing: thirdly, it is either
mild, or else strong and vehement: fourthly, it is either Periodical, coming at
a certain time, or Irregular, coming now and then at unawars: fifthly, it is
either Accidental or Hereditary: sixthly, it is either in Infants or in people
of years; all which differences have some thing special in them in respect of
the Cure; the parts afflicted are primarily the Brain, afterward the original
of the Nerves, and the Nerves themselves by consent.

CXLVI. The signs of the Falling Sickness.

1. The Pathognomick sign of the Falling Sickness, is a Foaming at the Mouth;
for that it is scarcely observable to be common with any other Disease.

2. The Diagnostick signs are, a falling down to the ground, by reason of the
Convulsion of the parts, there is a heaviness, giddiness, and pain of the Head,
a paleness of countenance, and an inordinate motion of the Tongue, and coldness
of the extreme parts, there is also a fearfulness and sadness in the Sick.

3. Sometimes one part is contracted, by the force of the Convulsion, sometimes
many parts; one has his Hands contracted, another turns round, some run up and
down, and others sit, foam cry out aloud, as if they were extremely frighted,
some snort and gnash their Teeth, some have an involuntary excretion of
Excrements, but most, if not all Foam at Mouth.

4. An Idiopathetick Epilepsy, is known by the Distemper of the Brain,
heaviness of the Mind, slowness, dullness, decay of Memory, Vertigo, pain of
the Head, and troublesome Sleeps; the Sick, also suddenly falls down without
the least foreknowledge or sense of the fit, and coming to himself again,
remembers not any thing that was done.

5: If it be sympathetick, and proceeds by consent from any other part, it is
known by the proceeding Distemperature of these parts.

6. If it be from the stomach, it is troubled with weakness, indigestion, want
of appetite, Wind, loathing and pain.

7. If it be from the spleen, there is commonly a heaviness, a dull pain and
tumor upon the part.

8. If from the Mesentery, there are nauseous Vapors, paleness, sometimes an
Atrophia, or pining; sometimes Melancholy preceeds, as also such as are called
Hysteric fits.

9. If it be from the Womb, fits of the Mother, or Vapors often preceeded,
from all which, certain Vapors are sent to the Brain, or some of the Nerves of
the par Vagum being hurt by the tumultuous approach of the Animal Spirits
extending and twitching the Nerves, causes the Brain immediately to be affected
by consent.

10. If it be from the extreme parts, it is known by certain Vapors, or thin
and subtle matter creeping upwards by degrees; suppose in the Foot, the Sick is
sensible of the fit before it comes, and a certain Vapor, resembling almost as
it were a Living thing, creeps upwards by degrees, first from the Toes,
thorough the whole Foot, then from the Heel, to the Ankle and by degrees creeps
up to the Calf of the Leg, then to the Knee, afterward to the Thigh, Hip,
whole Side, up the Shoulder, by which the whole Arm and Hand is immediately
affected and siezed, from thence to the Neck drawing it a little aside: Lastly,
the Head, where it siezes the Brain and the original of the Nerves, upon which
the Sick immediately falls down with a great shreiking and crying out; and for
the most part toward the end of the fit, with a foaming at the Mouth.

11. Now in this Case, when the Disease proceeds from the extreme parts, as is
aforesaid, the Sick is perfectly sensible of its first approach, and feels it
as perfectly to creep upwards by degrees, as if he should put his Foot into
cold Water and so shove it into the water deeper and deeper gradually, whereby
the Water rises higher and higher upon the part, in such manner in all
respects, and with like coldness as the coldness of the water, does the fit
begin and take its progress to the Brain; insomuch, that he can tell you of its
coming, and how gradually it proceeds, and talk rationally with you, even till
the cold Vapor siezes the Brain it self; which will be about the time, that
you can leisurely tell a hundred, or more.

12. If the Disease be mild, all the foregoing signs which we have ennumerated,
are not seen in the sick at once, but sometimes one, sometimes another, and many
times, at the end of the fit, there is no foaming at the Mouth.

13. If it be strong and vehement, the most vehement signs will be present, and
almost all of them; besides the falling, and diverse motions of the Body, there
will be a staring and thrusting forth of the Eyes, a great difficulty of
Breathing, a strong Convulsion of the parts, especially on one side, with a
certain foaming at the Mouth.

14. And it may be known, whether it comes from the right or left side of the
Head, by this, that on that side, the Head will be more dull, with a kind of
obtuse pain, there will also a noise be on the same side, with a kind of
thickness of hearing, and the Eye on that side will be more dark and obscurer
than the Eye on the other side.

15. That which is Periodical, comes commonly at the New or Full Moon, or at
the Quarters, or twice or four times a year, so that by observation, the sick
can certainly tell when the Fit will be.

16. If it be Irregular, it comes twice or thrice a day, or oftener, sometimes
two or three times a Week; but what time soever it comes, the intervals between
each Paroxysm, are always unequal, so that when the fit comes upon the Patient,
it is as it were by surprise.

17. If it be Hereditary, it is known by the Father and Mother, and their
Generations before them, being Epileptical.

18. If it comes not from Hereditary Parents, it is always Accidental.

19. That which is in Infants, commonly makes them black in the Face, like a
Man that is Hanged and the blood settled, but that which happens to Age, causes
not such discrepancy in the color of the Countenance.

20. Hitherto of the signs of a perfect and present Epilepsy, but there are
other signs showing an approaching Epilepsy, or an Epilepsy to come; in respect
of the Animal Functions there is an accustomed trouble and disturbance of Mind,
dullness and heaviness of the Head, Headache, Vertigo, desire of much Sleeping,
troublesome Dreams, dullness of Mind, fear, trembling, sorrow, perplexity,
forgetfulness, sloth, heaviness of moving, a deprivation of the Senses, a
cloudiness in the Eyes, noise in the Ears, heaviness or dullness of hearing,
stinking of the Nostrils, unnatural Sneezing, Yawnings, etc.

21. The vital Functions are also hurt, the beating of the Pulse is unequal or
irregular; scarce at all to be felt at one time, and at another time beating
with extreme vigor and vehemence, there is also difficulty of Breathing,
shortness of Breath, and an inclination to Anger upon triffles, or no occasion.

22. In respect of the natural Functions, there is either a nauseating or
loathing of Meat, indigestion, Heart-burning, or pain of the Stomach, or there
is an immoderate hunger, so that the Sick thinks he could devour all things, he
spits much, his Urine is thin and crude; there is paleness of Face, swelling at
the Breast and Stomach, as if the party would burst, and an indisposition to
stir and move, as if idleness or sloth had siezed the person.

23. These are all of them signs of an approaching Epilepsy; and sometimes of a
fit ready to come, in those that have had it already, but all these signs are
not to be expected to be found in one person, but some of them in one, some in
another, according to their various Natures and Dispositions, Qualifications,
Habits and Constitutions.

CXLVII. The various Causes of the Falling Sickness.

1. There are many Causes of an Epilepsy, which arise in part from the quantity
or quality of the matter causing.

2. The place where the prime Cause lodges, is within the Encephalon, and
springs from the indisposition of the parts within the Skull.

3. But it may be demanded how that can be in those kinds of this Disease,
where the Paroxysm begins in the extreme parts, and ascends by degrees up to
the Head.

4. Truly, this seems only to be so, and happens by mere Accident: For that the
Morbifick Cause subsists about the Encephalon it self, thereby causing
immediately a great insensibility and dis-order with a vehement Contraction of
most of the Members and Viscera.

5. By which it appears, that the Encephalon and original of all the Nerves are
possessed with the Morbifick Cause.

6. The opinion of Galen was, that an Epilepsy was caused from an imperfect
obstruction of the Ventricles of the Brain; but the true Cause of an Epilepsy
is, from the sudden Rarifaction and Explosion of the Animal Spirits inhabiting
of the middle the Brain, and these are the first and immediate Cause of this
Disease, by which the Brain being as it were blown up and tumefied, is rendered
insensible, and the Nerves appending thereto are put into Convulsions, whence
comes, the sudden accession of the Fit, and the deprivation of both the
internal and external Senses.

7. The Procatartick Cause of the tumultuating of the Animal Spirits we do not
just now deliver, that being known almost to every one, but the Proeguminine
Cause deserves a little to be enquired unto.

8. For that the Animal Spirits should be so rarifyed, as to tumultuate and to
make those preternatural Explosions of their own accord, is not reasonable to
believe, but there must be somewhat that must go before, as the Act of the
sensitive Soul, to stir up those kinds of perturbations, viz.

9. There must be something, which must obstruct their regular and natural
Motions, and this in some persons which we have seen opened, that dyed of an
Epilepsy, was either a bag of water in the Cavities of the Brain, or a viscous
water, or other corrupt matter, yellow, green, blew, etc. filling the said
Ventricles, by reason of which, the said Spirits assemble together in a
tumultuous manner, as aforesaid.

10. These Spirits making their explosions upon the the original of the Nerves,
and indeed the Nerves of the whole Body, affect the other spirits in the
nervous system by way of Consent, whence it is, that though the Disease seem to
begin in the Hand or Foot, yet the original thereof is absolutely in the Brain
it self.

11. Barbet says, that the nearest Cause is the Lympha vitiated in the Brain,
and irritating the Nerves by its sharpness, and indeed he was not far off from
the Truth.

12. For Nature being hurt by such a kind of sharpness, sends as it were Floods
of Spirits toward the relief of the parts afflicted, but by reason of this
vitiated Lympha, falling upon the original of the Nerves, the influx of the
Animal Spirits is hindered, whence follows immediately Convulsion.

13. And by reason that the Community betwixt the nervous Systeme and the
animal Spirits, is cut off by the Matter interposing, thence follows the so
sudden deprivation both of Reason and Sense, and of all regular motions.

14. Decker is of the opinion, that it is an acid Lympha, that Causes this
Obstruction, and indeed that is most probable, because that nothing can prick
or vellicate so much as acid things; and all Obstructions made by Acids, are
commonly great, and the Coagulations difficult to be dissolved.

15. Whence it is, That Diseases arising from an Acid Salt, as for certain the
Epilepsy does, are of so difficult Cure.

16. Deckers says, That from the Thumb of the left Hand, he had sometimes
observed a sharp matter to be moved toward the Heart and Brain, so that the
Patient was sensible of it.

17. This is nothing but what we said before, of this Disease, proceeding by
consent from the extreme parts.

18. But the chief Observation that Deckers makes hereof, is this, That the
said Thumb being bound, had sometimes kept back the Fit, and that the sick had
been several times so delivered from the approaching Fit.

19. This is confirmed by Galen de locis affectis, lib. 3. cap. 5. Also
Johannes Schenkius de Epilepsia, Lib. 1. Obs. 82. affirms the same.

20. I knew the person very well, that had it arising from the Foot
aforementioned, it is probable the same thing might have succeeded in him, but
my Youth and want of Skill in Physic; for it is near twenty years since,
hindered my putting the thing in trial.

21. If it proceeds from the Womb, pains of Loins does preceed; for those Women
are for the most part troubled with vehement Headaches.

22. The remote Causes thereof, says Barbet, are to be sought in the milky
Glandules, the Womb and other parts; for whatever it is, whether it be Choler,
Phlegm, the Pancreatick juice, the Seed or menstruous Blood, that makes the
Lymphatick Juice sharper, easily causes an Epilepsy.

23. The Brain not being rightly disposed, the region of the Brain is by all
concluded to be the primary seat of this Disease.

24. But Willis will by no means admit, water heaped up within the Ventricles
of the Brain, nor a thick viscous humor impacted in the passages of its Pores,
to be the Conjunct Cause of this Distemper; for, says he, such Causes are
begot by degrees, and would show some certain signs before hand of their first
coming upon one.

25. To which we answer, that so they do, else how comes it to pass, that we
have so many previous signs of an approaching Epilepsy, as we have a little
above enumerated.

26. But says he, the assault of the fit being over, such a matter could not
wholly be discussed in so short a time, but that from its Relicts, some
impediments of the Animal Functions would remain, which rarely happens in the
Epilepsy, unless it be inveterate.

27. To which we Answer, that there is no such need, that the matter should be
wholly discussed in so short a time; for it has been observable that the
intervals between each fit, comes not so much from the discussion of the
matter, as by the quieting of the Animal Spirits, which force their way through
the Obstruction.

28. So that when the continuity of the nervous System is made up with the
original fountains of the Animal Spirits, the Fit passes off, but when the
obstructing matter, fluctuates afresh, and dissolves again that continuity,
then there comes an accession of a new fit.

29. From hence it may certainly be concluded, That the middle of the Brain is
always the primary Seat of the Epilepsy, and that originally the morbifick
Cause is stored up in that Region.

30. But the Distemper growing inveterate, it gradually spreads it self through
the whole Brain, enlarging its dominions after a wonderful manner, scattering
the Morbifick Matter every where up and down, which subjects the whole, much
like Garrisons in Conquered Countries, keeping the vassallated people under
subjection.

31. Its dominions being enlarged through the whole Head, extends it self
likewise to the nervous Appendix, so that the semination of the Disease, like
lightning, is diffused thorough the whole nervous Systeme; but sometimes one
Nerve is more affected than another, whence Convulsions follow; sometimes in
one part, sometimes in another.

32. And if the nervous System be universally a like affected, the Convulsion
generally affects the whole Body.

33. The Cause why Epilepticks fall down with violence, is partly from the
surprise and sudden coming of the fit, whereby all their Reason and Sense is
taken from them, and partly from the Convulsion of the Nerves adjacent to the
Head, which being strongly contracted, the whole Body is vehemently carried
forth and falls violently.

34. From these Contractions other parts become swelled and tumifyed as the
Lungs, maxillary Glandules both upper and lower, out of which the Lymphatick
Juice, being strongly pressed and squeesed, forthwith the Spittle appears like
foam at the Mouth.

CXLVIII. The Prognostics of an Epilepsy.

1. The Epilepsy is a Disease hard to Cure; if it be inveterate, or of long
continuance, it is so much the more difficult: and the Idiopathetick is harder
to Cure, than that which is by consent.

2. That which is in Infants, is of all the easiest to Cure, and much more easy
while it is Recent, the Child having had but few fits.

3. That which is Hereditary, is never to be cured, and ancient Physicians were
of the opinion, that if it happened to people, which were much in years, that
it was also incurable, but experience has contradicted that.

4. For we have known people above fifty years of age Cured, but we confess it
has been with great difficulty.

5. In some persons it is cured without the help of Physic, in whom, siezing
upon them young, it has continued ten, twelve or fourteen years, but at their
arriving at puberty or ripeness of age, or in Virgins at the coming down of
their Terms, the Disease of its own accord has left the Patient.

6. Though in this Case, I am very apt to believe, that there might be some
congruous and benevolent Directions in Heaven, of the principal Stars or
principal Significators, which might be adjuvant to the Native at that time.

7. If all the Functions be abolished, the Convulsion vehement and strong, the
Paroxysm of long continuance, and Excrements flow forth of their own Accord,
the Cure will be exceeding difficult.

8. If it comes from external Causes, or evil Diet, Surfeiting or Drunkenness,
the Convulsion mild, and the fits not long, the Disease will not be very
difficult to Cure.

9. Hippocrates says, That an Epilepsy coming in Boys at fourteen years of age,
and in Girls before twelve, is curable; but after the age of twenty five it is
incurable, as appears by his Sect. 5. Aphor. 7. and of this opinion is Galen;
but the latter part of this Prognostic, as we said before, is not always true.

10. A strong Epilepsy often kills the Patient in the fit; or else turns into
an Apoplexy by reason of the strength of the Symptoms, whereby there is a great
Concussion of the Brain, and a profligation of the strength of the whole Body.

11. Riverius tells us a strange kind of Story; that sometimes the Concussion of
the Brain will be so great in the fit that some pieces of the Bones called
Processus Mamillares will come out of the Nostrils.

12. If the Falling Sickness comes of Melancholy, it commonly degenerates into
Madness, by which means the morbifick matter offends the very substance of the
Brain it self, whereby being corrupted, it obfuscates or darkens the Animal
Spirits, whence comes a Melancholy Dottage.

13. If the Epilepsy proceeds from a thick Lymphatick Juice, it for the most
part degenerates into an Apoplexy or Palsy.

14. If a Quartan Ague, or a violent burning Fever comes upon an Epilepsy; it
commonly Cures it, because by the vehemence of the heat, the Morbifick matter
comes to be dissolved, rarifyed and discussed.

15. If the fits are often repeated, and every time grow stronger and stronger,
the Animal Faculties will be quickly obliterated, by reason of which, the Vital
Spirits come to be tainted, from whence, the Vital Functions comes by degrees
to be profligated.

16. And this seems to be by consent of the Nerves serving the Praecordia, so
that at length the whole Body languishing, the Pulse being quelled, the Vital
flame is not long after extinguished.

17. The reason why this Disease often ends in a Palsy, Madness, or Melancholy,
is from the conformation of the Brain, being depraved by the manifold and
tumultuous rushings forth of the Animal Spirits, whereby its natural state is
so perverted, that the morbifick Particles of another kind are admitted,
whereby the Animal Spirits, are either fixed or become dull and sluggish, being
depressed by the Morbifick matter afflicting.

18. If the Falling Sickness happens to Children, and they be not freed from it
about ripeness of age, being overcome by a new and natural fermentation of the
Blood, the Disease will continue, and it is much if it be not incurable to Death.

CXLIX. The Method of Curing the Epilepsy, and first of the Cure of Infants.

1. The Cure of the Falling Sickness in Children, differs something from that
in elder people; for that in the latter, strong Evacuations are commonly used,
which we cannot do in Children, nor indeed is there that need and necessity,
because such a heap of morbifick matter cannot be supposed to be in them, as is
in those of elder years.

2. The chief things we use to Children, are Revulsives, Discussives and
Specificks.

3. For Revulsion, Blysters may be applied to the nape of the Neck or behind
the Ears, or an Issue may be made behind the Ear, whereby the Morbifick matter
is plentifully drawn away, or the Seton may be applied to the nape of the Neck,
which may run for two, three, or four Months.

4. Blystering Plasters also applied to the soles of the Feet may be very
profitable; for by reason of the consent of parts, they sometimes Cure to a
miracle.

5. Issues a so in the Arms and Legs are also approved of by many Learned and
Experienced men; if the Child be two or three years old, Cupping-Glasses with
Scarification may be applied to the Shoulders, Loins, or both.

6. I knew a Chyrurgian, which lanced the Head, and cut many deep flashes even
to the Cranium, whereby the Child bled extremely, after which he healed them
forthwith up again, upon which the Child recovered, and had no more fits.

7. If the Paroxysm be tedious and violent, and a watery humor flows forth at
the Nostrils, it will be good to shave the Head of the Child, and to apply a
Vesicatory over the whole Head, this I have known sometimes to Cure at the
first drawing, it may be repeated if occasion be, two or three times.

8. It cannot be done in vain, but with great advantage to the Sick, forasmuch
as that the watery juice or degenerated Lympha, which is the Conjunct Cause of
the Disease, is clearly drawn away.

9. And this is more admirably done, and with greater advantage in Infants than
in persons of elder years, because as yet in Children the Sutures of the Skull,
are not perfectly closed, whereby not only the aforesaid degenerated Lymphatick
Juice, but also the preternatural Vapors lodged in the Cavities of the Brain
are drawn forth.

10. This done, the Soar being healed, we must make use of Discussives, of
which the Powers of Amber are of mighty force, being Bathed upon the whole
Head, so all the Powers of Sage, Rosemary, Lavender, sweet Marjoram, Thyme,
Tansey, Featherfew, Savory, and such like.

11. For they pierce and penetrate through the flesh, Pericranium and softness
of the Skull, whereby not only the Menings of the Brain, but the Brain it self
are marvellously dried, comforted and strengthened, and the Animal Spirits
themselves recreated.

12. The Temples, Forehead and Nostrils, ought to be bathed with the same, and
this ought to be done twice a day for two or three Weeks together.

13. After which, the Epileptick Emplaster of Franciscus Valesius may be
applied to the Coronal Sutures; for as much, as it is said, that that Plaster
alone never fails of the Cure; the Composition and Preparation whereof you may
see, sect. 73. 4. aforegoing of this Chapter.

14. Moreover, it will be profitable that the the Hands and Feet should be
bathed with these Potestates or Powers aforenamed, not only because it might
probably have a rise from those parts, but also by reason of the consent and
sympathy of the same.

15. The third Intention, consists in the exhibiting of proper Specificks, if
the Child be two, three or more years old, the Gilla Theophrasti, or Salt of
Vitriol may be profitably given.

16. For, as Paracelsus says, They are specificks in rooting out the
Falling Sickness, especially in Children; for by gentle Convulsions of the
Stomach, they cause Vomiting, whereby the root of the peccant matter is taken
away, the Stomach cleansed and strengthened, from whence an laudible Chyle is
generated, whereby strong and salutiferous Spirits are bred in the Heart and
Brain.

17. This same salt of Vitriol may be given two, three or four times according
as you see the Disease increase, and it is so safe, that it may be given even
to young Children: the Dose to Children is ten grains to half a dram, according
to their Age and Strength.

18. If it be given by a wise Hand; it will not only evacuate the humor upward,
but also derive a part of the morbifick Cause downwards.

19. Some commend Hiera picra, or the Infusion thereof in a proper Liquour,
truly the thing is good, but it is too bitter to be given to Children.

20. The following things, I have proved as Specificks in this Case: Take
powder of Male-peony, seeds and roots, of each one dram and half: powder of
Man's skull, salt of Hartshorn and powder of Nutmegs, of each a dram: Elks-hoof
prepared, half a dram: mix them in a fine Powder; Dose from 15 grains to half a
dram.

21. Take Castoreum, a dram and half: prepared Amber, half a dram: powder of
Peony-seeds and Peacocks dung, of each two scruples: Oil of Lavender, ten
drops: mix them; Dose ten grains to a scruple.

22. Take Nutmegs, a scruple: powder of Peony-roots and seeds, of each two
scruples: Misleto of the Oak, one dram: Castoreum, Man's skull prepared, Musk in
fine powder, of each four scruples: mix them together, and make an Electuary
with the Extract of black Cherries: Dose one dram to two drams: giving after it
a little Cinnamon water.

23. Take Tincture of Castoreum, Tincture of Man's skull, of each an ounce:
Tincture of Lavender-flowers, Tincture of Saffron, of each six drams: spirit of
Man's skull, half an ounce: Powers of Amber, two drams: mix them; the Dose one
dram or more in proper Liquor.

24. Take Water of the flowers of the Line-tree, Water of the flowers of the
Lilly Convally, of each six ounces: syrup of the juice of Alkermes, syrup of
the juice of Male-peony-flowers, of each four ounces: spirit of Angelica the
greater Composition, spirit of Castor, of each three ounces: strong
Cinnamon Water, Aqua Coelestis, of each two ounces and half: Powers of
Rosemary, Sage, Lavender, Origanum and sweet Marjoram, of each half an ounce:
white sugar, enough to sweeten them well: mix all together, and so you have a
Liquor whitish red; of which you may give the Child half a spoonful every
Morning and Evening alone, or in a glass of Sack.

25. With this following Powder, I have cured several: Take choice Musk, one
dram: Ambergrise, Cochineal, Salt of Man's skull, of each a scruple: mix and
make a Powder, which may be given with a little Conserve of red Roses, drinking
after it a Glass of choice Canary.

26. Also our Epileptick Powder which we have commended in the Cure of the
Vertigo is inferior to very few things.

27. Riverius commends this, Take Peony-seeds a dram and half:
Lavender-flowers, a pugil: Amber, two scruples: make a fine powder.

28. Columna says, That the root of Wild Valerian given in powder in Milk, has
cured very many.

29. Vntzerus, commends the Gall of a black sucking Puppy, but of a Bitch for a
Girl, to be taken to three or four drops in Tile-flower water; he says, it
will cure to a Miracle.

30. Riverius commends the Backbone, and the Members contracted, to be
anointed with this following Liniment. Take Oil of Rue, Oil of Earthworms, of
each two ounces: Oil of Castor, a dram: and with a little Aqua Vitae, make a
Liniment, it ought to be well rubbed in twice a day, Morning and Evening.

31. That learned Man and great Chemist Maxy, commended to me this as a great
secret, that would never fail: Take Venice Treacle, Confect of Alkermes, of
each half an ounce: salt of Man's skull, fine powder of Cocheneel, Musk in
subtle powder, of each two drams: Ambergrise, a dram: mix and make an
Electuary, of which the quantity of a Nutmeg may be given the Child every
Morning.

32. He also commended to me salt of Vipers, mixed with equal parts of salt of
Man's skull and Musk, as a remedy that had scarcely any equal.

33. Moreover he told me, from manifold and large experiences, that all fixed
Alchalies, if often and long taken, would infallibly Cure this Disease; for
that they enervated the Acid juice, and the sowerness of the Blood, which he
conceived to be the Cause of this Disease.

34. And that he knew more to be cured by taking of Volatile and Fixed
Alchalies, such as are Salt and Spirit of Man's skull, Hartshorn, Salt of Amber,
Pearl, Coral, Crab's-eyes and Terra Sigillata, etc. than by many other highly
magnified Remedies; for that these were cheap and easily prepared, other
Specificks being costly and more difficult to be gotten.

35. But this he observed, that unless they were long given, they profited
nothing.

36. If the Child's Belly be bound, you ought to loosen it by an emollient
Clyster, I know by experience, that the Infusion of Rhubarb in White Wine or
small Cinnamon Water, is an admirable thing, being given for many days together.

37. To the former Specificks, you may add Ens Veneris, see more of this Cure
in our Synopsis Medicinae, lib. 3. cap. 22. sect. 3. and cap. 29. sect. 11. of
the last Edition.

LONDON, Printed for Th. Dawks, and Langley Curtiss.

The Chapter of the Falling Sickness continued.
CL. The Cure of the Falling Sickness in elder Persons.

1. In the Cure of this Disease, we must respect the time in the Fit, and the
time out of the Fit; if a Fit be present and be long, it is necessary to
endeavor the recovery of the Sick, lest it proves mortal, because some by the
long enduring of the Fit, have been totally overcome.

2. You ought to put into the Mouth, some proper Epileptick or Apoplectick
water; the Epileptick water of Langius is highly commended, so also the Aqua
Vitae Matthioli, and his Cinnamon water.

3. Powers of Rosemary and Sassafras, are of wonderful Power in this Case; so
also the Powers of Lavender, Sage, Rue, Thyme, and sweet Marjoram, of Oranges,
Limons, Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamon, Amber, and the like; any of which may be
given from twenty drops to forty or more, in half a spoonful or a spoonful of
Sack, which may be forced into the Mouth.

4. The Nostrils, Temple, Forehead, nape of the Neck and Backbone may be
bathed therewith, using strong Friction; or some few drops of those Powers may
be forced up the Nostrils, by means of which the Animal Spirits will be
quickened and enlivened.

5. It will be also good to chafe and bind the exterior parts with proper
Ligatures, Cupping-glasses may be applied with Scarrification and Epispasticks
to the brawny parts.

6. If the body be bound, sharp Clysters and Suppositories ought to be given.

7. The part convulsed or shrunk up, ought to be gently rubbed and stretched
out, if possible, bathing them also in the mean time with some of the Powers
abovenamed.

8. The Nostrils, Wrists and Sutures of the may be also bathed with the same
Powers, or anointed with the Oil of Rosemary, but in the time of the Fit all
Narcoticks are forbidden.

9. Sometimes a Glass of fair Water being drunk, may do good, and experience has
confirmed, that two or three glasses of water flung violently into the Face of
the Sick has restored them, and brought them out of the Fit.

10. Hitherto of the time in the Paroxysm; the time out of the Paroxysm, or the
preventive Cure now follows; if the body be bound, it will be good to exhibit
Enema in Epilepsia Mynsichti, which mightily derives the humors downwards, or
this following: Take Mutton-broth, a pint: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, Oil
Olive, of each three ounces: Tincture of Collocynthis, one ounce: mix and make
a Clyster to be given warm.

11. This done, the Stomach may be the next day cleansed with proper Emeticks,
such are salt of Vitriol, which may be given from half a dram to one dram and
half, the Emetick Tartar of Mynsicht, which operates with much safety and
gentleness, curing all pains of the Head, Frenzy, Madness, Carus, weakness of
Memory, noise of the Ears, difficulty of Hearing, Vomiting, Wind of the
Stomach, pain of the Sides and Dropsy, as also putrid and acute Fevers; being
given from two grains to fix in Broth or Wine.

12. Some commend Vinum Benedictum Rulandi, which is a singular good thing.

13. Take Crocus Metallorum, six drams: salt of Vitriol, one dram: mix and make
a Vomit; it gently cleanses the Stomach and Bowels, and derives the Morbifick
matter from the Head to the inferior parts.

14. Or, Take Hartmans Infusion of the glass of Antimony, one dram: Sala his
Emmetick syrup, a dram and half: which may be mixed and given in a draught of
posset drink.

15. Or, Take Mercurius Vitae, two grains: salt of Vitriol from ten grains to a
scruple: salt of Tartar, half a scruple: mix them well together by grinding
them on a Marble, and take it in the pap of an Apple.

16. After Vomiting, you may purge with this, Take of our Family Pills, half a
dram: Mercurius dulcis three or four times sublimed, a scruple: Oil of
Lavender, two drops: make a Dose of Pills to be taken early in the Morning
fasting.

17. This Purgation may be two, three or four times repeated, according as need
requires, and the manifest appearance of the Cacochymia.

18. Or, Take Pil. foetidae, de succino, of each one scruple: Resin of Jalap,
five grains: Oil of sweet Marjoram, two or three drops: mix them, and make a
Dose of Pills.

19. Joel commends this: Take pil. Cochiae, Arabicae, Troches of Agarick, of
each one scruple with a little Marjoram Water, make a mass, which form into
twenty seven Pills.

20. Take pil. Assajarith, Agarick trochiscated, of each a scruple: extract of
black Hellebor, five grains: with Lavender-water, make a mass of pills for two
doses.

21. Take Hellebor, two drams: Sena, three drams: biting Cinnamon and
Anniseeds, of each a scruple: bruise them and digest twenty four hours in
Marjoram-water, then boil them gently, strain, and resolve therein,
Diacatholicon and Diaphoenicon, of each two drams: mix them well for a draught.

22. Platerus commends this following Potion: Take of Diaphenicon, three drams:
Hiera with Colocynthis, one dram and half: syrup of Fumitory compound, one
dram: Hyssop and Peony-water, of each four ounces: mix for a Potion.

23. Or this: Take roots of Acorus, Peony, of each half an ounce: Liquorice,
Polypody, Sena, of each six drams: Misletoe of the Oak, Hysop, Bawm, Betony,
flowers of Staechas, Peony-seeds, Dodder of Thyme, of each two drams: flowers
of Bugloss and Borrage, Fennel seed, of each one dram: Raisons, an ounce: make
a Decoction in spring water, strain and infuse therein Agarick, a dram and
half: Ginger, half a dram: strain again, and dissolve therein Hiera with
Colocynthis.

24. Or, if bitter things be loathsome: Take in place thereof Diaphenicon, two
drams: syrup of Roses solutive an ounce: mix and make a Potion.

25. If the sick be of a dull, heavy, melancholy and unpleasant habit of Body;
you may give him this: Take Roots of Polypody, Peony, sena, of each half an
ounce: Epithymum, three drams: Fennel-seed, one dram: make an Infusion in
Goats-Whey; boil a little, strain and dissolve therein Catholicon, half an
ounce: Confectio Hamech, two drams: syrup of Fumetory, an ounce: mix and make a
Potion.

26. If the habit and constitution of the Body be extreme hot, you may give
this: Take Male-peony roots, one ounce: Betony, Clary, Succory, Endive, Hops,
of each half an handful: Cordial-flowers, Broom flowers, of each a pugil:
Anniseeds and Fennel-seeds, of each a dram: Raisons, number twenty: Prunes,
sebestens, of each number ten: Polypedy, six drams: sena, Tamarinds, of each
half an ounce: Yellow Myrobolans, a dram and half: make a Decoction, and infuse
therein Rhubarb, a dram: spicknard, a scruple: strain and mix therewith syrup
of Roses solutive, half an ounce; and make a Potion.

27. Or, instead thereof, a purging Wine may be made after this manner: Take
sena, an ounce and half: Agarick trochiscated, half an ounce: Turbith, two
drams: pulp of Colocynthu, half a dram: Tartar, 3 drams: roots of Peony,
Acorus, of each half an ounce: Wormwood, Hysop, Betony, of each 3 drams: leaves
of Rue, one dram: flowers of Stoechas or Lavender, two drams: Fennel seeds, a
dram and half: thick Galangal, 2 drams: Ginger, a dram: Cardamoms, half a dram:
Wine, a sufficient quantity; bruise all and let them infuse, of which he may
drink a little draught, more or less for some days.

28. Or, a Purging Diet may be thus made: Take new Ale, three or four Galons:
sena, twelve or fourteen ounces: Rubarb thin sliced, three ounces:
Juniper Berries bruised, seeds and all eight ounces: Raspings of Guajacum,
Sassafras rasped, of each four ounces: yellow sanders rasped, Carraway-seeds
and Coriander-seeds bruised, of each two ounces: put all into a Bag with a
stone to make it sink, let them work up; and when the drink is clear, let the
Sick drink thereof half a pint more or less for fifteen or twenty days together.

29. Or, a specific purging Electuary may be made thus: Take Hiera of
Colocynthis, an ounce: Diaphenicon, half an ounce: Diacarthamum, Diasena, of
each two drams: Oil of Amber, twenty six drops: mix it with the pouders, and
with syrup of Staechas or Hysop, make an Electuary, the Dose is two drams every
Morning according to Age and Strength; this Purge by reason of the Oil of Amber
is made a specific against the Falling Sickness.

30. For this purpose also I commend my Catharticum Argenteum, it works gently
both upwards and downwards, and takes away the conjoined cause by the Roots.

31. I remember I gave it to a Maid that had five or six Fits of the
Falling Sickness; her Parents were very poor, and they desired me to do
somewhat for their Daughter for Gods sake: the Girl was a well-set, lusty
strong Girl, I gave her an ounce of my Silver Medicine, ordering her to take it
four times with two or three days distance betwixt each time of taking; she did
so, and by means of that one only ounce: she was made perfectly well, from
which it appears, that Luna or Silver has a mighty operation upon the Head and
Brain, and not much Inferior are the Pilulae Lunares, aforementioned.

32. All these Medicaments by a specific power or force, take away the
conjoined or morbifick Cause by the Roots, and do also in some measure
strengthen the Head, Brain and parts afflicted; for that they sympathize
extremely with the Animal Spirits, refreshing and recreating them; for which
harmony or unity, it may be believed that such kind of Remedies have a
specific force above all others.

33. The next Intention of the Cure is performed by Revulsion; for besides
application of Blisters to the Soles of the Feet, and other depending parts; if
the body abound especially with gross humors, the Hair ought to be shaved off,
and a Vesicatory ought to be applied over the whole Head, and after healing to
be repeated two, three or four several times; for by this means, the Brain is
mightily discharged of a part of the morbifick matter.

34. This done, a Seton may be applied to the nape of the Neck, or
Cupping-glasses with scarification to both Shoulders, as also to the Loins and
Hips, if the person be very strong.

35. Errhines may be applied to the Nostrils, such as are made by dissolution
of a dram of Euphorbium, in a pint and half, more or less of White Wine, which
is to be cast up the Nostrils an hour before going to bed, or in the Morning
fasting, as may best agree with the condition of the Patient.

36. A few days after, if the Patient has a good strength of Body, may be
administered the Sternutatory of Deckers, mentioned in my Doron Medicum, lib. 2.
cap. 21. sect. 24. by which means a mighty evacuation will be made, and by the
use of which alone, I have cured the Falling Sickness in a Man of about thirty
years of Age; it is true the Disease was recent, for he had not had above twelve
or fourteen Fits.

37. Joel commends the following Sternutatory, although we know nothing exceeds
that of Deckers abovementioned: Take powder of white Hellebor, powder of sweet
Marjoram, of each half a scruple: Castoreum and Euphorbium both in fine powder,
of each two grains mix them: of which let a small quantity be blown up each
Nostril by a quill: this we could not but insert, being second to Deckers; for
it works wonders in this Disease, but it ought not to be given, but to very
strong persons.

38. A more gentle thing, which may be used to weaker persons, are the Errhins
of Platerus. Take juyces of Rue and Sow-bread, of each two drams: juice of
Peony, one dram: Gall (I suppose) of an Ox, Castoreum in powder, of each half a
dram: make a Liniment to anoint the Nostrils within, which may be used by
course out of the Fit.

39. Or, instead thereof you may use this Sternutatory: Take roots of white
Hellebor, half a scruple: Pyrethrum, Pepper, of each one scruple: Peony-root,
and flowers of Stoechas, of each half a scruple: make a sneezing Powder.

40. The humor may be drawn away by the Mouth, by Gargling with this following
Apophlegmatism: Take roots of Pyrethrum, half an ounce: Rocket-seeds, half a
dram: sweet Marjoram and Hysop, of each half an handful: cut, bruise and boil
them in Water and Vinegar, of each one pint: boil till half is consumed, strain
and mix therewith Honey of Roses, three ounces, to be used as a Gargarism.

41. After the Gargarism, this following Masticatory ought to be chewed long in
the Mouth: Take sweet Marjoram, Rosemary, of each one dram: Cinnamon, Mace,
Cloves, of each half a dram: Carraway-seeds, Coriander-seeds, Cubebs, Mastich,
of each a dram and half: make all into a fine powder, which mix with a little
white Wax melted, so much as may make it into Balls, of which let him be
continually Chewing one in his Mouth.

42. Or in place hereof, and which I think is no ways inferior, but much
superior, may be chewed the root of Gentian: For that thing so used alone, has
a miraculous and specific property against the Falling Sickness.

43. If it be a Woman, and her Courses be stopped, they ought to be provoked by
things proper for that purpose, among which we commend this: Take Agarick
trochiscated, fine Aloes, of each one dram: Rubarb, a dram and half: red Myrrh,
Castoreum both in powder, of each half a dram: pulp of Male-peony-seed, a
scruple: with the juice of Leeks, make Pills, of which she may take half a
dram, for three or four nights together, going to bed.

44. And up the Womb, she may put a Pessary made of the following things: Take
Orrice root, seeds of Nigella or Gith, of each a dram: Colocynthis, a scruple:
Castoreum and Catholicon, of each half a scruple: juice of Sow bread, one
ounce: Honey, half an ounce, or more; mix them, and over a gentle heat
evaporate the humidity till it comes to a due thickness to make a Pessary.

45. If the Sick has had usually a flux of the Hoemorrhoids, and of late have
not bled, it will be good to apply Leeches to the Haemorhoidal Veins.

46. The third Intention, is performed by exhibition of Specificks, whose use
we shall consider, either as Diet, or as Medicine.

47. For Diet, we prescribe the following, as a thing we have often times
experienced: Take spring water, eighteen or twenty pound: Raspings of Guajacum,
Raspings of Sassafras, of each twelve ounces: roots of Male-peony bruised, of
Rosemary, each sixteen ounces: Lavender, Sage, sweet Marjoram, Peony seeds and
flowers of each six ounces: boil the Woods first to the consumption of eight
quarts, then toward the end of the boiling, add the other things: boil about a
quarter of an hour or more, and strain out, dissolve in the strained Liquor, so
much Honey as may make it pleasant; put it up into a little Vessel, whilst it
is just warm, and put into it the following things. Take Male-peony roots,
flowers and seeds, of each twelve ounces: Rosemary, Juniper Berries, Misletoe
of the Oak, of each six ounces: put all into a Bag with a stone in it, to which
put Aleyest, a pint: shake them well together and let them work; when they have
done working, let it be the constant drink of the sick, and let him drink no
other, except our Antepileptick Wine, which may be taken now and then, and
sometimes in the Morning fasting, for the Stomachs sake, and is made as follows.

48. Take choice Rhenish Wine, a gallon: Peony-roots dried and bruised, Peony
seeds bruised, roots of Valerian, Vervain dried, Anacardiums, Cubebs, both
bruised, of each three ounces: Gallangal, Nutmegs, Misletoe of the Oak, Carduus
Benedictus, Rosemary-flowers, Wormwood, of each two ounces: Coriander-seeds,
the flowers of Lilly-convally, Cloves, Betony, Cinnamon, flowers of stoechas,
of each one ounce: juice of Peony, six ounces: infuse all together, over a
gentle heat, ten or twelve days; after which add clarifyed Virgin Honey, twelve
ounces: dissolve well, strain hard out by pressing; and let it settle: let the
sick drink now and then a little glass of the clear.

49. In the making of this Wine, if you can instead of the Canary get Wine of
black Cherries, it will be so much the better, and if you dissolve in the Wine
salt of Hartshorn, or Man's skull, half an ounce: salt of Amber Volatile, two
drams: it will be yet much more powerful.

50. Platerus makes a Drink after this manner: Take shavings of Guajacum, half
a pound: Misleto of the Oak, a quarter of a pound: Male-peony-roots, an ounce:
(I should rather think four ounces were better) Water, twelve pound: mix and
boil to the consumption of a third part; let him take it for ordinary drink,
and sometimes when he takes it, he may mix it with simple Wine, or the Wine of
Pope Adrian for his Stomachs sake.

51. Thus much for Diet, we come now to the medicinal specificks, with which
Authors plentifully abound; Platerus commends the two following Syrups of Peony.

52. The more simple sort: Take juice of Peony, six ounces: Honey of squills an
ounce and half: Vinegar of squils, half an ounce: sugar, two ounces: boil them
to a consistency of a syrup, it is laxative and pleasing by reason of its
sharpness.

53. The Compound Syrup: Take roots of Peony, one ounce and half: roots of
Eringo, Dropwort, white Dittany, Birthwort, of each one ounce: roots of
Masterwort, Pyrethrum, squils prepared, of each half an ounce: Misleto of the
Oak, six drams: Hysop, Sage, Rue, Marjoram, Betony, Carduus, Ground Pine,
Germander, Mil-foil, Cinque foil, Hypericon, white Bryony, of each one handful:
flowers of Stoechas, of Lavender, Violets, Clove-gilli-flowers, of each a
pugil: Peony-seeds, three drams: seeds of Rue, Trefoil, of each a dram and
half: Annise and Fennel seed, of each two drams: make a Decoction in Water or
Wine, strain and add juyces of Peony-roots and of Hysop, of each two ounces:
Honey of squils, three ounces: sugar, five ounces: Aromatize with Cinnamon, two
drams: and make a syrup by gentle boiling: Dose from half an ounce to an ounce,
and to be often taken.

54. The same Author also commends this following Syrup: Take juyces of
Misleto, of Rue, of the greater Housleek (but in my opinion the juice of Peony
would be much better) juice of Carduus, of each two ounces: juyces of sage, and
Marygold, of each one ounce: sugar, four ounces: boil them to a consistence of
a syrup, of which let a spoonful or two be often taken.

55. This following Powder has been commended much: Take roots and seeds of
Male-peony, of each one scruple: Man's skull prepared, half a dram: Elks-hoof
prepared, two scruples: red Coral prepared, Terra sigillata, of each a scruple:
Musk, half a scruple: make a subtle powder, which give from half a dram to a
dram in Lavender-water.

56. Or this: Take Man's skull, one dram: Volatile salt of swallows, Elks-hoof
prepared, of each half a dram: Leaf-Gold, one scruple: red Coral and Pearl

fine powder, to be given in Sugar.

57. Or, Take roots and seeds of Male-peony, Misletoe of the Oak, of each a
dram: Castoreum, two scruples: sweet Marjoram, Nutmegs, Aniseed, of each half a
dram: Volatile salt of Man's skull, salt of Hartshorn and Volatile salt of
Vipers, of each a scruple: mix and make a powder, which may be given from a
scruple to half a dram in this following water.

58. Compound water of Swallows: Take young swallows, number fifteen:
Jack-daws, young Cuckows, of each four; or if they cannot be had take swallows,
twenty five: Man's blood, six ounces: filings of Man's skull, three ounces:
Castoreum, Peony-roots and seeds, Misletoe of the Oak, of each two ounces: Rue,
Betony, Marjoram, Sage, Rosemary and Lavender-flowers, Hysop, of each one
handful: Cinnamon, Cloves, Cubebs, Anacardiums, of each one ounce: of the best
Canary, or Rhenish Wine, six pound: infuse twenty four hours: then distill them
in a glass Alembeck to dryness: cohobate the water upon the feces four or five
several times; then keep it for use: Dose one ounce or more; it is an excellent
thing in this case, and beyond many things much commended.

59. Platerus, much commends this following Water made of Mans-blood thus: Take
the Blood of a sound Man from a Vein newly opened, six ounces: Male-peony roots
fresh sliced, two ounces: Skull of a Man rasped, one ounce: Peony-seeds, half
an ounce: Hyssop, Rue, of each one handful: draw off the Water presently while
the Blood is warm: Dose one or two ounces.

60. Take Conserves of Male peony-flowers and flowers of Stoechas, flowers of
Rosemary, of sage, and of Betony, of each one ounce: Conserves of the flowers
of succory and Violets, of each half an ounce: roots and seeds of Male peony,
of each two drams: roots of Pyrethrum, leaves of Hysop, of each a dram: seeds

of Peony, of each two drams: Misletoe of the Oak, three drams: with Honey of
squils, make an Electuary.

62. Galens remedy of Squils: Take squils sliced, Virgin Honey Clarifyed, of
each half a pound: powder of Peony-root, and of the seed of each one ounce:
Misletoe of the Oak, Hysop, Rue, Agarick, of each two drams: Pyrethrum, one
dram: Powder of Man's skull, half an ounce: put them into a glass being first
beaten together; digest in Horse-dung or Sand for fifteen days, being thoroughly
hot, so as it may scald, let the juice be pressed out for use: Dose one or two
spoonfuls once or twice a Week.

63. Take old Venice Treacle, three drams: roots and seeds of Male-peony,
Misletoe of the Oak, of each a dram: Powder of Man's skull, two drams: seeds of
Basil and of Clary, of each half a dram: with syrup of Poppies, make an
Electuary: Dose one dram or more going to bed.

64. The Antidote of Montagnus, which Riverius says, goes beyond all, by which
many have been cured, is made thus: Take roots of Male-peony, stoechas, and
Pepper-wort, of each ten drams: Agarick, five drams: Pellitory, Carraway-seeds,
Dill, Assa foetida, round Birthwort, of each two drams and half: juice of
squils, Honey, of each a pound and two ounces: boil the Honey and Juice to a
good consistence, then add the Pouders, and make an Electuary, of which three
or four drams may be given at a time, as Age requires, continuing it about
thirty days together.

65. Riverius his Specific Electuary: Take Conserves of Rosemary-flowers,
Peony and Bugloss, of each half an ounce: Citron-peels candied, two drams:
powder of the Misletoe of the Oak, Peony-seeds and Elks Claws, of each half a
dram: Man's skull not buried, calcined Philosophically, a dram and half: Coral,

dulcis, Diatrion santalon, of each two scruples: old Venice Treacle, Confectio
Diahiacyntho, of each a dram: spirit of Vitriol, fifteen drops with syrup of
candied Citron-peels, make an Electuary: Dose the quantity of a large Nutmeg,
drinking after it a little Cinnamon Water.

66. Platerus his Antidote against the Falling Sickness: Take Peony-roots,
Misletoe of the Oak, of each two drams: roots of Tormentil, round Birthwort,
Dropwort, Cinque-foil, Dittany, of each one dram: squils prepared, a dram and
half: Agarick, Hysop, Marjoram, of each two drams: Male-peony-seeds, a dram and

powder) of each a dram and half: shavings of Ivory and Hartshorn, of each half
a dram: Hares Rennet, two drams: Mastich, Benjamin, Ammoniacum dissolved in
juice of squills, with Honey of squils, a sufficient quantity make an Electuary.

67. If the Disease be caused from Worms; you must use things that are
Cathartick and kill Worms: such are Aloes, Rhubarb, etc. which are to be mixed
with things that resist Putrefaction; such are juyces and seeds of Citrons, of
Limons, Hartshorn, Coral and Coralline, which being joined with seeds of
Male-peony, Misletoe of the Oak, etc. will be of good effect.

68. Or, Take Aloes, Rubarb, of each one dram: Wormseed, Coralline, the pulp of
Male-peony-seed, of each half a dram: Diagredium, six grains: with the syrup of
the juice of Limons make Pills.

69. Or, Take Rubarb, one dram and half: Coral, two scruples: Pulp of Citrons
and Male-peony-seeds, shavings of Hartshorn and Ivory; Misletoe of the Oak, of
each a scruple: sugar dissolved in Purslane-water, with juice of Limons, one

70. If the Disease come from fits of the Mother; let the following Pills be
taken: Take Castoreum, Assa foetida, of each half a dram: Gum Ammoniacum,
sagapenum dissolved in Vinegar of squils and inspissated, the Gall of a Bear,
of each half a scruple: Oil of Amber four or six drops: with juice of
Peony-roots, make a mass of Pills to be given from half a scruple to a scruple
at Night going to bed.

71. If it be by consent of the Stomach: Take seeds of Arach, Dill-seed,
Radish-root, of each half an ounce: Figs slit, number two: bruise and boil in
nine ounces of water to the consumption of a third part; strain and mix
therewith Vinegar of squils, two ounces: It will empty the Stomach well by
Vomiting.

72. After purge with this following: Take Pilulae de Hiera simple,
Aloephanginae, Agarick trochiscated, of each a scruple: with syrup of Wormwood
make a mass of Pills: for two or three Doses, according to the strength of the
sick.

73. Decker commends the sweet spirit of Nitre, and he says, That the white,
red and yellow-flowers of sal Armoniack, exceeds all, which does not only cut
the phlegm, but correct the Volatile, sharp and sour humor; which is very
Volatile and most penetrating, with which Melancholy men themselves are made
merry; which thing Decker is bold to say, he has proved above an hundred times.

74. And he says also, that he has not only cured the Falling Sickness in Boys,
by this Medicine, but also in adust persons.

75. Crato calls native Cinnabar, the Loadstone of the Epilepsy; and Decker
says, it does specifically help in this Disease; but he says, that of Antimony
is better.

76. And Crato has made a powder, which you may see in our Pharmacopoeia, lib.
4. cap. 21. sect. 91. to these you may add pulvis Antepilepticus made of the
Crystals of Luna; Pulvis Epilepticus Wickardi, pulvis Antepilepticus Schroderi
and pulvis Antepilepticus Mynsichti: all which you may see in the Book and
Chapter before recited sect. 53. 77. 80 and 94.

77. The Species Diacinnabaris Mynsichti, has a wonderful Power against the
Epilepsy, Apoplexy, Convulsion, Palsy, Vertigo, Megrim, fits of the Mother, and
other Diseases of the Head and Womb, having cured those who have been troubled
nine, ten, twelve, yea eighteen years with many of the forenamed Diseases: Dose
from a scruple to a dram in the Morning fasting, till the Cure is perfected.

78. If all these things after a long taking prevail not, you may exhibit the
following Powder: Take Musk, three drams: Ambergrise, a dram and a half: Civet,
one scruple: Volatile salt of Vipers, Volatile salt of Man's skull, of each half
a dram: mix them with the Civet, and then with the Musk and Ambergrise in fine
powder: if you please you may add Powder of Cloves, half a dram: Peacocks dung,
two scruples: the Dose from half a scruple to a scruple or more.

79. If this prevails not, we must be necessitated to come to the use of
Opiats; of which our Gutta Vitae is inferior but to few, being given from
fifteen drops to twenty five or thirty in a glass of Sack.

80. Or, if the Sick likes not this, they may take our Laudanum, beginning
first with a small Pill of two grains; and so increasing it by degrees to six
or eight grains or more.

81. To these you may add all the Opiats we have ennumerated, in cap. 4. sect.
142. 55 ad 63. aforegoing; where you have a large Catalogue of them, and to
which we refer you.

82. There are multitudes of other things, which are specificks against this
Disease, which we have gathered together in the last Edition of Our Synopsis
Medicinae, lib. 3. cap. 29. sect. 94. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

83. Outwardly, for Topics, we advise, that the Head and Coronal Sutures, as
also the Forehead, Temples, Nostrils, Backbone, Hands and Arms, Feet and Legs,
being extremely well bathed Morning and Night, with the Powers of Rosmary,
Sassafras, Oranges, Limons, sweet Marjoram, Sage, Lavender, Amber, or any of
them; or a Compound mixture of them together; or with the Apoplectick Balsam of
Horstius or Mynsicht, or the Balsamus Catholicus Steinbergij, Balsamus
Polychrestus Mynsichti, the Balsamus Mnemonicus Sennerti, Balsamum Nervinum
Schroderi, Balsamum vitae, Balsamum Paralyticum Horstij: Balsamum Paralyticum
Clossaei, or the Balsamus Cephalicus, all which you may see in Our
Pharmacopoeia in their proper places: Applying over the Coronal Sutures the
Epileptick Emplaster of Valesius at sect. 73. 4. above.

84. If at last, these things being used, nothing prevails, we must come to the
last and only remedy, which is the Trepaning and opening of the Skull, to let
out those malign Humors or Vapors.

85. The following superstitious Observation Joel says, Has been proved by
experience: That the day before John Baptists day, at the bottom of the root of
Mugwort (others say, at the root of Plantane) certain Coals, like burnt or dead
Coals will be found, which being reduced into powder, and given a dram at a
time in water of Tile-flowers, or of flowers of Lilly-Convally, will quickly
and infallibly Cure.

86. I fear this is a Monkish Cheat, and that the Coals were designedly before
hand put there, because they are not to be found at the same time at the roots
of all the Plants of the same Species, but only at the roots of some, which the
promoter of the Miracle can before hand directly go to. I once saw those Coals
at the bottom of two or three Plantane-roots, which my Director after the
digging up of two or three in vain did find out: but we dug up above twenty
more, at the roots of which we could find no such thing, which made me to
mistrust the deceit.

87. Yet Deckers says, That they are almost always to be found under Mugwort,
being very old acid roots, consisting of much Volatile salt; it may be as he
says, I will not much contend.

88. The usual Amulets, which are born and worn by hanging about the Neck, are
Vervain, Peony, Misletoe of the Oak, Elks-hoofs, Hypericon, etc. Take
Peony-roots, Misletoe of the Oak, of each one ounce: Elks-hoofs, Nutmegs,
Cloves, Mace, of each two drams: Rue, Hysop, of each a dram and half: powder
them grossly, and put them into red Sarsnet, to be hung about the Neck.

CLI. Of an Epilepsy caused by Distemper of the Womb.

1. Although from what we have already said, the signs, causes, judgments and
method of Cure of an Epilepsy may be known, proceeding from what cause soever;
yet by reason that which arises from distempers of the Womb is more eminent and
remarkable, we shall here say something to it in particular.

2. This distemper is much more grievious, than that which preceeds simply from
a Distemper of the Brain, because the Symptoms concomitant are more numerous
and vehement. It is to be known as before is said, from a preceding Distemper
of the Womb, wherewith the Sick has been for some time afflicted, as Tumors,
Wounds, Ulcer, Wind, Filthiness, etc. from whence comes, pain, stink,
putrefaction, fits of the Mother so called, etc.

3. If the cause be from the Womb affected, the Sick seldom or never foams at
Mouth, but there are present also all or most of the Symptoms of Hysteric
fits: for there is not only a Convulsion as in a simple Epilepsy; but there are
also present other Symptoms, proper to the part afflicted.

4. Some Authors take the cause from foetid vapors arising from the Womb,
proceeding from a malign and putrified matter, not always of one kind, but
sometimes proceeding from the seed, sometimes from the Blood, sometimes from
vicious humors, which infest sometimes one part, sometimes another, sometimes
the Heart, and then it causes Fainting and Swooning fits; and sometimes the
Brain, whence comes a Vertigo, Apoplexy, or an Epilepsy.

5. If those vapors, or that matter be much and plentiful; the Disease will be
of longer continuance: If little, it will be the more easily discussed: if it
be malign, many evil Symptoms will remain after the Fit is over; if not, the
sick will be pleasant and merry.

6. An Epilepsy arising from distemper of the Womb, will be as perdurable as
that Distemper, nor will there be any hopes of curing the one, till a way be
found out to remove the other.

7. Yet it is not so rebellious as a true and simple Epilepsy, though the
accidents or symptoms be much more heavy and grievious: and sometimes it is
cured by the bare application of fit Hysteric Medicaments, and so perfectly,
as that it returns no more.

Indicationes Curativae.
8. The Indications of Cure are twofold, as in a pure Epilepsy, to wit, either
in the Paroxysm, or out of it: The Cure in the fit is to be directed to take
away the strength and malignity of the Convulsive affection, which how that is
to be performed, we shall remit you to what we have already spoken hereof; save
that in composition with those things, you will do well always to mix
Hystericks, especially such as may affect the Womb, by their proper Odor, as
well as by their specific qualities.

9. Out of the fit, the Cure is to be instituted as in that of fits of the
Mother, adding thereto such things as are specificks in the Cure of the
Epilepsy: but this is to be chiefly noted, that whereas the Head is the
principal part afflicted, so also, such things as strengthen the Head and
Brain, are principally to be made use of.

10. Sennertus commends this following as an excellent thing: Take Roots of
Peony, Scorzonera, of Bryony, Misletoe of the Oak, of each half an ounce:
Polypody of the Oak, one ounce: Rue, Pennyroyal, Calamint, of each one
handful: seeds of Peony, of Hartwort, of Agnus Castus, of each two drams:
Carthamus seeds bruised, half an ounce: flowers of Rosemary, of Sage, of
stoechas, of Borrage, of each two pugils: boil them in spring water a
sufficient quantity: strain, and to a pint and half thereof add juyces of
Betony, of Yarrow, of Herb Mercury and of Mugwort; in which infuse for a night
choice sena, five ounces: Agarick trochiscated, Epithymum, of each half an
ounce: choice Rubarb, Cloves, of each two drams: seeds of Anise and Fennel, of
each three drams: The next Morning boil, and strain, and with sugar, a
sufficient quantity, make a syrup, which aromatize with a little
Cinnamon Water. The Dose two ounces every Morning fasting.

11. Take Cinnamon Water, four ounces: Powers of Pennyroyal, of Savin, of
Sage, and of sweet Marjoram, of each one ounce: Camphir, half an ounce: Musk,
three drams: Ambergrise, two drams: mix, and digest for a Week, then keep it
for use: Dose from twenty to forty drops in Wine in the Morning fasting:
Moreover with the same, the Head, Temples, and Navel may be bathed every
Morning and Night; upon using of it shake all well together, and then use it.

12. The following Pills may be taken twice a Week, from a scruple to a dram,
an hour before Supper: Take roots of Peony, choice sena, of each half an ounce:
Mugwort, Betony, Rue, Yarrow, of each half an handful: make a Decoction to
which add juice of Herb Mercury a sufficient quantity: in which dissolve fine
Aloes, one ounce and half: the feces being settled, decant off the clear, which
evaporate away to the thickness of an extract, which make into Pills with the
following powder: Take Rubarb, two drams: Agarick trochiscated, half an ounce:
Mastich, Epileptick powder, of each half a dram: mix, and with syrup of Mugwort
make Pills.

13. Now for the strengthening of the Head, and restoration of the Womb from
its vitiated habit, this following may be of good use: Take Powers of Rhodium,
and of Savin, of each two ounces: Musk, two drams in fine powder; Ambergrise,
one dram: mix them and digest for a week: Dose from twenty to forty drops in
Rhenish Wine and Sugar.

14. Sennertus commends this: Take Foecula of Peony, one dram: Foecula of
Bryony, Amber prepared, Misletoe of the Oak, of each half a dram: Bezoar-stone,
Man's skull prepared, of each a scruple: mix and make a powder: Dose one scruple
to half a dram in waters of the flowers of the Line-tree and Scorzonera; or
made into Rouls with a little Sugar. Or, you may exhibit this: Take seeds of
Agnus Castus, one ounce: Wood of Aloes, two drams: roots of Peony, seeds of the
same, Misletoe of the Oak, of each one dram: make all into a fine powder.

15. This following we commend upon our own experience, as a most admirable
thing: Take Skulls dug out of the grave after twenty or thirty years burial,
being well cleansed and prepared by levigation, half an ounce: choice Musk,
three drams: Ambergrise, two drams: make all into a subtle powder: Dose half a
dram in the Morning fasting, drinking after it a little glass of black Cherry
Wine. Some may question, wherefore we choose Skulls after so long time being
buried, and not rather those fresh and never buried.

16. To this we answer, that Experience as well as reason has convinced us: for
we have used oftentimes Skulls unburied without success; whereas we scarcely
ever used the other, but with some profit to the Sick: Moreover in a certain
Patient to whom we had given more than thirty doses of Skulls not buried, there
was no good at all found, yet upon the exhibition of six or seven Doses of
Skulls which had been long buried, the same Patient miraculously recovered, and
was perfectly restored, so as the Disease never returned any more; and the same
thing we have several times since proved in several others afflicted with an
Epilepsy, to our very great satisfaction.

17. But the reason of the thing is obvious: for in a fresh Skull, the
Particles are not so maturated or ripened, so as to set the volatile parts at
liberty to operate, as they are in a Skull long buried; the which may be easily
proved in distillation, for that the volatile parts in the one are nothing near
so easy to ascend in the former, as they are in the latter: Moreover the latter
is more imbibed, impregnated, or satiated with the volatile parts of the flesh,
on the outside and the substance of the Brain within, all which putrefying
about the Skull, and drying away, the substance of the Skull becomes
meliorated, not only with its own proper Spirits and Salts; but yet much better
digested by being as it were imbibed or immersed in the humidities and volatile
Particles of the parts adjacent; which putrefying about it, and leaving their
pure parts at liberty are probably attracted or drawn into the substance of the
Bones of the Skull.

18. Take Scorzonera, Cloves, Peony-roots, Misletoe of the Oak, seeds of Peony,
raspings of Elks-hoofs, Dittany of Creet, of each one dram: Hartshorn
prepared, Man's skull prepared, of each half a dram: Amber prepared, Peacocks
dung, of each one dram: pouders of the Electuaries de Gemmis, and Diamoschu
dulcis, of each a dram and half: Cinnamon, two drams: Betony, Marjoram, Bawm,
of each a dram and half: seeds of Agnus Castus, and of Rue, of each one dram:
sugar Candy, the weight of them all: mix them in a fine powder: Dose a dram to
two drams Morning and Evening, chiefly about the New and Full Moon.

19. Take Conserves of Bawm, of the flowers of the Line-tree, of
Rosmary-flowers, of Lilly-Convally, roots of scorzonera candied, of each one
ounce: one candied Nutmeg, species Diamoschu dulcis, one dram: powder of the
seeds of Agnus Castus, and Peony-roots, of each two drams: levigated powder of
Man's skull, three drams: with syrup of stoechas, or of the juice of Male-peony
flowers, make an Electuary.

20. This following Water was also highly commended to me by an ancient
Practiser in the Art of Physic: Take roots of Peony, of scorzonera, of white
Dittany, of each one ounce: Sage, Rosemary, Bawm, Lavender, of each one
handful: Galangal, Nutmegs, Cubebs, Zedoary, grains of Paradise, of each half
an ounce: affuse upon them Wine, and Water of Lillys convally distilled with
Wine, of each a sufficient quantity; let them stand eight days in digestion,
and then be distilled in a Copper Vesica tin'd within, or in a glass Cucurbit,
according to Art: In the distilled Liquor, to every pint thereof add Volatile
salt of Man's skull, three drams: choice Musk, two drams: which digest ten days
togegether, and keep for use.

21. You may cleanse the Body and Womb with this (if the sick cannot take
Pills:) Take Peony-roots, round Birthwort-roots, of each one ounce: Polypody of
the Oak, six drams: Betony, Rue, Pennyroyal, herb Mercury, of each half a
handful: seeds of Peony, half an ounce: seeds of Carthamus bruised, one ounce:
choice sena, one ounce and half: sena Cods, six drams: seeds of Anise, of
Fennel, and of Hartwort, of each two drams: flowers of Bugloss and Rosemary, of
each a handful and half: make a Decoction in fair water: strain, and in a pint
thereof infuse pure Agarick, one ounce: Ginger, Galangal, Rubarb, of each two
drams: strain again, and with white sugar make a syrup, which aromatize, with a
little Cinnamon in powder: with this the Body ought to be once or twice a Week
cleansed during the whole Cure: if the Sick cannot take a purge in this form,
let them take it in the form of Pills as abovementioned.

22. The Body being sufficiently cleansed, the Head and Womb may be
corroborated with some of the things abovenamed; or with this following: Take
choice Venice Treacle, five ounces: of the best spirit of Wine, a pint:
Camphir, two drams: digest in a glass close stopped in Horse-dung or sand for a
Week, then distill in Balneo with a gentle heat, so that the Alembick may not
grow very hot; draw off about a third part, and repeat the distillation three
times: the Dose is one Spoonful Morning and Evening, adding thereto four drops
of the Oil of Vitriol, or six drops of the Tincture of Coral, and sweetening it
a little with white Sugar.

23. Or this, which may be exhibited in the time of the Paroxysm also: Take
syrup of the juice of Peony, one ounce: syrup of the juyces of Rue and of Bawm,
of each half an ounce: liquid extract of Castoreum, two drams: extract of
Juniper Berries, a dram and half: extracts of Angelica and Zedoary, of each one
scruple: of the former spirit, two drams: Lavender-water, one ounce: mix them:
Dose one spoonful.

24. Among the number of Corroboratives are accounted Mithridate, and Venice
Treacle, Confect of Alkermes, Diamoschu dulcis, Bezoar stone, given with
Scorzonera water: but most effectual things are the Oil and Powers of Amber,
which may be given in the fit, as also to provoke the Terms.

25. If the Courses be obstructed, you must use with your Corroboratives such
things as provoke them, among which some highly commend this: Take green
branches of the Fir or Pitch-trees, one handful: Mugwort, half a handful: tops
of Juniper, bark of the Beech-tree, of each a handful: Celandine, leaves of the
Alder-tree, of each half a handful: roots of swallow-wort and round Birthwort,
of each five ounces: make a Bath in fair water, for the sick to sit in for
about half an hour. The Belly and lower parts (after bathing) may be anointed
with this: Take Oils of Rue and Bays, of each an ounce: Chemical Oils of
Aniseeds, of Cloves, and of Camomil, of each a dram: mix them.

CLII. The Cure of an Epilepsy by consent from the Stomach:

1. If vapors arising from the Stomach to the Head be the cause of the
Falling Sickness, it is known by a certain pain going before, a perturbation
and sickness at Stomach, with a kind of heaviness or weight about the
Precordia, want of Appetite, weakness of the Concoctive Faculty, belching of
Wind, with other like Symptoms.

2. The Sick also upon the accession of the Fit, is sensible of it beforehand;
and it oftentimes comes upon an emptiness of the Stomach, or too long fasting.

3. Children are often affected with this Disease from this very cause, when
either the Milk is corrupted in their Stomachs; or it was before hand of a
vicious quality, from some evil habit of Body in the Nurse; and then it is
known by gripings in the Bowels of Child, the Ordure being either of a Saffron,
or of a Verdigrise like color.

4. In order to the Cure, purgation is necessary; and that kind of Purgation by
Vomit, more especially if the Sick is apt to that evacuation. The Bilious humor
Physicians say, needs no preparation: but thick, tough and viscous phlegm, they
say, ought to be prepared beforehand for evacuation, that it may be the more
easily expelled (which thing Dr. Willis stoutly denis.) Sennertus advises, to
prepare the matter by taking Honey of Roses, Oxymels, Syrups of Betony,
stoechas, and such like.

5. If the Sick is not apt, or does not easily Vomit, the cause may be removed
by things which work by Stool, as Hiera picra, and pilulis ex Aloe, in a
choleric cause: Agarick, Jallap, in a phlegmatic cause: sena, Hellebor, etc.
in a melancholy cause.

6. In this case the stronger Purgers are not to be used, lest they draw too
much, or new matter to the Ventricle, and thereby augment the Disease by a
continued hurting or weakening of it.

7. The Stomach being cleansed, you must strengthen it with proper
corroboratives: In a hot cause you may apply Topics made of Oils of Quinces,
of Roses, of Olives, Omphacine, of Water-Lillys, of Lettice, of Nightshade,
etc. in a cold cause Medicaments made of Mastich, Mint, Wormwood, Cloves,
Nutmegs, and such like.

8. Inwardly, let the Food be given warm, and temperate in respect of quality,
not sharp, or salt, or fat, or oily; and Trallianus forbids the drinking of
Wormwood, or other bitter things, lest lying in the Ventricle, they should be
converted into Choler; yet doubtless where the cause is from cold, moist, and
indigested phlegm, things hot and bitter can do no hurt: however other things of
a warming Nature may easily be given instead thereof, as Coriander-seeds,
Betony, Cheb Myrobalans, preserved Nutmegs which come from the Indies, extract
of Juniper Berries, rolls of Aromaticum Rosatum, and Caryophilatum, Syrups of
Mastich and Cinnamon, etc. from which various Medicines, various Compositions
may be made according to the humor abounding. If the cause be from heat and
bitter and choler, you may use Conserves of Wood Sorrel, Marmalade of Quinces,
Quiddony of the same, Oils and Spirits of Vitriol, Salts, Sulphur, Nitre, etc.
of which also things may be compounded.

9. Now in the mixion, while you are compounding things to fortify the
Ventricle, you must be sure not to forget such things as are Specificks against
the Disease afflicting, to wit, the Epilepsy, for by this means, the Sick will
soon be restored to his pristin Health.

10. Take Conserves of Roses, of Betony, and of Peony, of each two ounces:
extract of Juniper Berries, half an ounce: powder of Man's skull, four scruples:
Indian green Ginger preserved, half an ounce: Oil of Vitriol, ten drops: with
syrup of the Conserve of Citron-peels and juice of Peony-flowers, make an
Electuary.

11. Take powder of Cloves, two drams: extracts of Peony, of Calamus
Aromaticus, of Carduus, of each one dram: Indian green Ginger condited, two
drams: with sugar a sufficient quantity, make Morsels.

12. Take Man's skull prepared, Peony-roots, Scorzonera, Nutmegs, Misletoe of
the Oak, of each one dram: seeds of Anise and Fennel, of each one dram: white
Amber, Peony-seeds, Peacocks-dung, of each half a dram: Cubebs, Anacardiums,
Galangal, Tormentil roots, Virginian Snake-roots, Rosemary-flowers, of each a
scruple: white sugar, two ounces: make all into fine powder: Dose two scruples
to two drams.

CLIII. Of an Epilepsy arising from Worms.

1. If any one be taken with Epileptick Fits, and the Cause thereof be from
Worms, it is known by these following signs: The sick oftentimes grates their
Teeth, and that many times, or for the most part in their Sleep; there are also
many sower Belchings, which by little and little filling the Mouth with an acid
humor, the Teeth be set extremely on edge, as if they had been eating of sour
things: and commonly the Breath stinks, or smells not well.

2. They are often taken with a trembling of the extreme parts, and many times
are affrighted, and vehemently cry out in their Sleep: there is also an Itching
of the Nostrils and end of the Nose, causing a great desire to rub the same:
about Evening, or in the Night time, the sick is troubled with much spitting:
sometimes there is a great heat and flushing in the Face, and that of a sudden,
with a pain and gnawing of the Stomach and Bowels.

3. And in some persons there is a contraction of the Muscles of the Abdomen,
with a grumbling of the Guts and torment; costiveness of Body, dry Cough,
Hiccough, or some ill taste in the Mouth: and sometimes the Worms are seen to
come away in the Ordure or Excrements voided by Stool; and in some persons
there is an (...) of some particular Member; in others an (...) of the whole
body, the body pining away, by reason the most of, or the principal nutriment
is devoured or consumed by the Worms, which Nature had otherwise designed for
the nourishment of the Body.

4. The Cure is not difficult, especially if the Disease has been of no long
continuance; but if the true cause of the Epilepsy is from Worms; unless the
Sick can be freed from them he will never be cured of his Epileptick Distemper.

5. If the Disease be caused of Worms, and it has been of a very long
continuance; then although the Worms (which seem to be the Proeguminine cause)
be taken away, yet will not the fits leave the Sick; for that by the long
continuance of the Distemper, a new nearer cause will be generated. And this I
had twice experience of, in two Children, who being afflicted with Epileptick
Fits arising from Worms for 8 or 9 years together: that although I perfectly
freed them both from the Worms, yet the Epilepsy left them not, till much more
means was afterward used; whereas another person troubled with the same
Disease arising from the same Cause, having been but a little while troubled
therewith, by freeing him from the Worms, he was perfectly cured of his
Epilepsy also.

6. The Cure ought to be performed by mixing Antepilepticks with such things as
kill and expel the Worms: Take Mercurius dulcis, a scruple: salt of Man's skull,
fifteen grains: saccharum saturni, three grains: mix for a Dose to be given at
night going to bed, purging the Sick the next Morning with a fit Dose of the
Infusion of Sena and Carraway seed.

7. The following thing is commended by Sennertus: Take fine Aloes washed or
extracted, a dram and half: scammony, Troches Alhandal, of each half a scruple:
distilled Oil of Wormwood, two drops: Oil of Myrrh and Zedoary, of each one
drop: mix and make a Mass of Pills: Dose from a scruple to half a dram, in the
Morning fasting: but if the Body of the Sick be difficult to work upon, it will
be better to take it over night, or about Midnight.

8. If the Worms lie really in the Bowels and not in the Stomach, it will be
good to give the Antepileptick Medicament by the Mouth, but the Medicine
killing the Worms by the Fundament in form of a Clyster: As, Take powder of
Man's skull, a scruple: salt of the same, six grains: Oil of Rue, two drops:
Conserves of Roses, two drams: mix, and give it overnight: the next Morning
give the following Clyster: Take Mutton-broth, a sufficient quantity, according
to the Age of the sick: Tincture of Colocynthis from an ounce to two ounces:
sal Armoniack, two drams: mix them, and give it warm; it is an excellent thing.

9. After sufficient purging with any of the aforegoing Medicaments, or others
that may be proper for the same: or with Mercurius dulcis, which as Sennertus
says, may be given from sixteen grains to a scruple or more, you may exhibit
the following specific: Take Elks-hoof prepared, six drams: Man's skull
prepared, four drams: Ox horns prepared, Diamoschu dulcis, red Coral, Pearls,
Emeralds, Crystals, all prepared, Terra sigillata, of each two drams: seeds of
Nigella, of Rue, of Peony, white Ditany, Nutmegs, Misletoe of the Oak, salt of
Hartshorn, of each one dram: roots of Peony, Hartshorn prepared,
Pea-cocks-dung, Scordium, Marjoram, Coralline, of each three drams: Musk and
Ambergrise, of each half an ounce: mix all in a fine powder: Dose from half a
dram to a dram, in black Cherry Wine.

10. Take salt of Man's skull, Mercurius dulcis, choice Rubarb, Musk,
Ambergrise, of each fifteen grains: extracts of Sena and Rubarb, of each half a
dram: mix them together for a Dose: and give it at night going to bed: with
this I cured a Maiden Gentlewoman, being given but six times, at due intervals,
having been above three years afflicted therewith.

CLIV. The Cure of a pure or simple Epilepsy, present in the fit.

1. The Cure preventive, of an immediate impending Parox^sm, is performed in
the opinion of some great Physicians by adhibiting one Pill of Laudanum
Opiatum, to four parts of which, one part of Oil of Camphir is added, or these
following Antepileptick Rouls: Take powder of Peony-roots gathered in a fit
time, one dram: Magistery of Pearl and red Coral, Man's skull prepared, Misletoe
of the Oak, of each a dram and half: white Sugar dissolved in Tile-flower
water, a sufficient quantity, make according to Art, a Confection in Tablets.

2. Or you may exhibit four or five drops of the Essence or Powers of
Castoreum, in a glass of Tile-flower-water: Or in defect thereof two or three
drops of choice Oil of Amber; or twenty or thirty drops of the Powers of the
same in the Epileptick Water of Langius, or Aqua Vitae Matthioli. Or this
following draught: Take the Epileptick Water of Langius, one ounce: syrup of
Peony almost half an ounce: spirit or Oil of Vitriol four, five, six, or seven
drops, mix them, to be immediately drunk.

3. Or you may give a spoonful or two, of this following Potion: Take Waters of
the flowers of Peony, of the Tile-tree, of Wall-flowers, of Herb-Trinity, of
each an ounce and half: Essence of Peony, one dram: salt of Man's skull, twelve
grains: salt of Vipers, five grains: syrup of the juice of Peony, half an
ounce: mix them for a draught. Or, Take Tincture of Castoreum, and of Peacocks
dung, Tincture of Arabian Mummy, of each a dram: black Cherry Wine, four
ounces: mix them, and drink it, having taken just before it a dram of choice
Venice Treacle.

4. The Cure in the Paroxysm: First, let the position of the body of the Sick
be rather upright than otherwise; and rather in a light and cheerful place,
than in a dark and melancholy: and let a great noise, crying or roaring out be
made in the Ears of the Sick.

5. The Mouth, or Teeth ought to be kept open with some wooden Instrument or
spoon, besmeared with the juice or extract of Rue, or some other Antepileptick,
that the Sick may the more freely Breath, and the foam flow forth, as also that
the Sick might not hurt or bite their Tongue.

6. The convulsed Members, as also the Thumbs, and Fingers of the Hands ought
to be extended and plucked gently, anointing the parts pained with some
Lenitive, or resolving Oil, chiefly Man's fat, or Oils of Camomil, of Rue, of
Bays, of Hypericon, of Juniper, of Earthworms, or of Castor, or with Petroleum:
Take Goose-grease, Oil of Earthworms, of each half an ounce: Oil of Camomil,
Oil of Turpentine, of each two drams: Oil of Juniper, Petroleum, of each one
dram: mix them to anoint with.

7. The former mentioned Oils, or the last Compound, with other of the like
kind ought to be anointed all along the Spina dorsi from the Vertebrae of the
Neck, to the Os Coccygis: Or you may bath the same with some proper
Antepileptick water; Or with the Powers of Amber. And you ought to hold the
Hands, Arms, and other parts of the Body, lest the Sick by any violent
concussion should hurt himself: Or, the matter should be retained in the Head
whereby the Paroxysm should be prolonged.

8. You ought also to use Revulsion by Frictions and Ligatures, which are hard
and painful; often losing of the Ligature, and then binding of it again hard
up: Frictions ought also to be used to the Soles of the Feet with Salt and
Vinegar.

9. If the Fit continues long, you ought to move the Belly with some sharp
Suppository or Clyster, which may not only empty the Bowels, but may also revel
the Vapors ascending up to the Brain. Make a strong Decoction of any
Antepileptick herbs: Take of this Decoction, a pint: Diaphenicon, benedicta
Laxativa, of each half an ounce: Hiera simple, two drams: Oil of Rue, two
ounces: honey of Roses an ounce: Sal armoniack, a dram: mix and give it warm.
Or Take a pint of the said Decoction: Jnfusion of Crocus Metallorum, two
ounces: Tincture of Colocynthis, syrup of buckthorn, of each an ounce: mix them.

10. To the Nostrills you may apply such things as have the power of
Attenuating and Discussing, and withal a specific force in resisting the
Epilepsy: among which things are the Juice, Essence and Extract of Rue;
Tincture, Essence, and Spirit of Castoreum: Oil, balsam, and powers of Amber:
Powers of sweet Marjoram, of Oranges, of Limons, of Nutmegs, of Cloves, of
Cinnamon, of Penny royal, Hyssop, Time, Wormwood, Sassafrass, Rosemary, etc.
Experience has confirmed wild Rue, and Savin to be Arcanum's here.

11. Upon the Tongue and Pallat you may put Mithridate or Venice treacle,
Confect of Anacardiums, or Diacastoreum, malaxed with the juice or water of Rue
or Lavender, Vinegar of Rue, or Tincture of Castor, to which you may add the
Salt of Rue or Carduus, or of any other Antepileptick plant.

12. And the same things which we have advised to be applied to the Nostrills,
may be applied to the Ears, crown of the Head, and Coronal sutures; or you may
impose thereupon the Emplaster of Franciscus Valesius formerly mentioned; the
Head being first shaved and anointed with the Oil of Man's skull: fumes also and
suffumigations of Juniper, Rue, Assafaetida, Galbanum, and Amber, profit much:
but some Physicians say, That the fumes of Amber, although in the fit they are
of great advantage, yet out of the fit they are prejudicial to the Sick.

13. If the Sick by these means cannot be recovered out of his fit,
Sternutatories are to be used; and to adult persons, such as are strong. Take
Roots of Pyrethum, Orrice, of each a scruple: Castoreum, white hellebor, of
each two grains: seeds of Rue, of Nigella, leaves of Marjoram in powder,
Cubebs, white Pepper in powder, of each half a scruple: make a fine powder, to
be blown up the Nostrills: Or Take white Pepper, Marjoram, of each two scruple:
Castoreum, ten grains: Euphorbium, two grains: make a fine powder, to be used
in like manner, a grain or two at a time.

14. It will be good also to apply Cordial Epithems to the Heart, and about the
Neck you may hang Xenechtons or Amulets, made of Peony seeds and roots, Elks
hoof, Coral, Jasper, Emeralds, Lapis Chelidonius, Vervain, Ox horns, Antimony,
Camphir, and other things of like nature.

15. It is requisite also that internally, for repressing of the fit and
recovery of the Sick out of it, some things should be prescribed; such are
Venice Treacle and Mithridate, dissolved in any convenient Vehicle. Tincture of
Castoreum, or powers of Amber, may be given to a scruple or more, in a little
black chery wine, or Essence of the flowers of Lilly-convally, or flowers of
the Tile-tree, or water of Swallows. In like manner the Powers of Man's skull
profit, or salt of the same, dissolved in any convenient Liquor.

16. For this purpose Sennertus advises to use the following powder: Take
native Cinnabar, half an ounce: red Coral and pearls prepared, of each two
scruples: Saffron, one scruple: leaves of Gold, number twelve, make a fine
powder, wh ch give to twelve or sixteen grains in the following water: Take
water of Tile-flowers, one ounce and half: black cherry water, or spirit of the
same, water of Swallows or Magpyes, of each one ounce: Tincture of Castoreum,
half a dram: mix them for a Vehicle.

17. Take water of Man's skull not buried (distilled by a Retort with a strong
fire and thrice repeated) Lixivium (made of the whole plant of Male Peony
calcined) of each three ounces: Castoreum, one dram: species Diamoschi, half a
dram: mix digest a week, and then distill in B. M. to the distilled liquor add
Oil of Vitriol five drops: Oil of Aniseeds, ten drops: mix them well together,
and give a spoonful at a time in the strength of the fit.

CLV. The Cure of a pure or simple Epilepsy, out of the fit.

1. For the more certain accomplishing of this cure, not only all the Ancients,
but also most of the Neoterick, or modern Physicians have been mightily busied
about rules and prescriptions for preparing the humor abounding for Evacuation:
but We (although we are not willing altogether to condemn those famed Men, yet)
with the Counsel of that Great and Learned man Dr. Willis, do judge that
advice to be (if not fruitless, yet) the going round about by the hedge, while
we leave untroden the straight and diametrical paths of Truth and right reason.

2. To avoid therefore the tracing of this unnecessary Labyrinth, we shall
begin at their second Intention which is the evacuation of the Morbifick cause,
which is don either by bleeding, purging, Sweating, or other like mediums of
Art.

3. Bleeding then is only to be admitted, where there is an extravasation of
blood; for if it be otherwise attempted, you will diminish the forces or
strength of the Sick so much, as to put the life of the Patient into apparent
danger, or at least make the disease incurable; for as much as the Sick has a
very strong and Giant-like disease to contend with all; and it requires all the
skill and wit of the Physician to conserve the strength and Vigor of the
diseased; for if that be impared by unnecessary bleedings or loss of blood;
that loss you will afterward find (but to the Cost of the Sick) to be
altogether irreparable.

4. Sennertus (a man as much for bleeding as most Physicians) prescribes it
with very much caution; as first, if signs of Plenitude appear; which although
we admit not of, yet we make the construction thereof to be, if there be any
extravasation of blood, and that in our Opinion, can only be truly called
plenitude; and then it is reasonable, that that which nature has cast forth,
and does daily cast forth should be taken away, and this is known by one
evident and manifest sign, viz. that the Sick is very apt either to bleed at
Nose, or else to spit Blood, and that in large quantities: In this cause (as
also where the blood is mixed with much Melancholy,) the same Author, would have
bleeding immediately and in the first place to be attempted, a Clyster or proper
purge being before hand given: and then also you ought not to draw away the
Blood largely, but sparingly.

5. In malo vero in veterato venae Sectio tuto omittitur: but if the disease is
inveterate, old or stubborn and rebelious, blood letting may (says he in his
Practice, lib. 1. par. 2. cap. 31.) be safely omitted: and that doubtless for
the reasons, by us already declared.

6. In the next place the morbifick cause is to be carried off by due purging.
And this according to the mind of Erastus, is not to be don only twice, thrice,
or four times, but to be continued even for some months: the Purgatives ought
not to be too violent, but according to the strength and constitution of the
Body of the Patient, and to be re-iterated every third or fourth day. But when
you see the Animal faculties begin to be restored, and the symptoms apparently
to remit, purgation ought to be used the more seldom, as once in seven or nine
days, but yet at that rate to be continued for at least a year.

7. And this is truly the reason, why many afflicted with stuborn Epilepsies,
have mist of a Cure, because (as well as specificks,) proper and long exercise
of purgation has been preremitted, for which cause sake, when the Sick has been
in an apparent hopeful way of Cure, the Physician, or his Epileptick has given
over too soon the necessary and proper evacuation. But at length Purging, may
be defered to longer space of time, as to once a month, etc. moreover, you
ought to begin with the more gentle things, and then by degrees, to administer
the stronger, till you come to the strongest of all: but in this Case the body
and constitution of the Sick, and your own reason, ought to guide you.

8. Among the more profitable Purges Agrick, in a cold, moist, viscous and
pituitous constitution is said to have the preceedency, and after that Jallap
and Mechoacan, or rather Elaterium and Cambogia. In a Choleric habit, authors
highly prize Rhubarb, and that not undeservedly, and next after that choice
Aloes, Colocynthis and Scammony, In a Melancholy habit Hellebor bears away the
bell; and next after that the best Alexandrian Sena: and in this latter case a
proper mixtion of Colocynthis and Scamony cannot be amiss; how ever we will not
only give them the names of some of the principal purges, but we will also give
you some brief forms of purging.

9. Purging Decoctions: Take any proper specific Decoction quantitate
sufficient, boil or infuse therein Agarick trochiscated, six drams: choice
Sena, one ounce: Ginger, Galangal, of each one dram: strain, six ounces thereof
and sweeten it with two ounces of Honey of Roses, for two Doses. Or, if the
Stomach be very foul, make a Decoction of Groundsel in Water or Wine, which
strain and sweeten, and exhibit to six ounces, or more: but if the Decoction be
made in distilled water from Peony or other Antepileptick Herbs, 'twill be so
much the better.

10. Purging Syrups: Take syrupus de spina cervina, one ounce and half: syrup
of Damask Roses, one ounce: mix them for a Dose. Or, Take syrup of Buckthorn,
Oxymel of squils, of each ten drams: Wine of squils, half an ounce: mix for a
Dose. Or, Take Peony roots gathered in a fit time, one ounce: true Acorus,
Misletoe of the Oak, of each half an ounce: Hysop, Betony, Sage, Rue, Prim-rose
leaves, Carduus Benedictus, seeds of Peony and Fennel, of each two drams:
flowers of the Tile-tree, of Lilly-convally, of Primroses, of each two
handfulls: polypody of the Oak, of each half an ounce: choice Sena, two ounces:
Carthamus seeds hul'd, one ounce: Agarick trochiscated, six drams: strings of
black Hellebor prepared, half an ounce: Ginger, Galangal, of each two drams:
Citron peels, Nutmegs, of each one dram: Infuse all in quantitate sufficient
of Peony water, afterward boil gently and strain, and make it into a syrup
with white Sugar, to which add Oxymel of squills, three ounces: dose two ounces
or more. Oxymel Helleborated is mightily commended by Gesner and others; so
also Syrupus Helleboratus Quercetani.

11. Purging Wines: Take Mechoacan, half an ounce: choice Sena, an ounce: Gummy
turbith, six drams: Ginger, Galangal, Cinnamon, Nutmegs, of each one dram:
Cloves, grains of Paradise, of each half a dram: flowers of Lilly-convally,
Arabian Stoechas, of each a pugil: Rhenish wine, a pint: bruise all and infuse
in a Glass close stopped in a warm place, strain, and filter through brown
paper, and sweeten with white sugar: dose two ounces: some commend the Vinum
Helleboratum, Vinum Antimoniale, and infusion of Crocus Metallorum, or of the
flowers of Antimony, to the skies, and that not undeservedly, if given by a
prudent hand: so also the dissolution of Sal Vitrioli in Rhenish. Or this
following of Erastus, Take roots and seeds of Peony, of each a dram and half:
Cinnamon, Mace, Galangal, Ginger, Cloves, of each one dram: Sena, one ounce:
Turbith, or Agarick, six drams: Wine, twelve ounces: Peony water, eight ounces:
digest twenty four hours, sweeten with sugar three ounces: and then strain
through Hippocrates his sleeve, for three or four doses: many more excellent
wines for this purpose, you may find in Our Pharmacopaeia and Doron, lately
published.

12. Purging Electuaries: Take Electuarium Diaphoenicon, three ounces: de succo
rosarum, two ounces and half: Antidote Convulsive, two ounces: Turbith, Esula
prepared, of each a dram: Castoreum, Scamony, of each two scruples: Costus,
Ginger, Cloves, of each one scruple: Saffron, seeds of Cumin and Rue, of each
ten grains: with syrup of Roses solutive, make an Electuary; dose half an ounce
to an ounce: The Antidotus Convulsiva, is thus made, Take Misletoe of the Oak,
Peony roots, of each one ounce: Castoreum, Sage, of each half an ounce:
Bay Berries, Man's skul burnt, of each one dram: Venice treacle, Mithridate,
both of the best, six drams: clarified Honey, two pounds: mix them for an
Electuary. Take Pulvis Arthriticus Paracelsi, two ounces: clarified Honey, a
sufficient quantity: mix and make an Electuary; it is an excellent purge for
this purpose: the powder here ought to be prepared with Man's skull levigated,
instead of other bones.

13. Purging extracts. In this cause Quercetan's Extract of black Hellebor is a
very admirable thing: so also the Extractum Benedictum in Our Pharmacopoeia, Or
this following: Take extract of black Hellebor, a scruple: resin of Scammony,
five grains: Volatile salt of Amber, ten grains: Chemical Oils of Rue and
Amber, of each two drops: Oils of Cinnamon and Cloves, of each one drop: mix
them for a dose.

14. Purging Morsels: Take Gummy Turbith, three drams: Diagrydium, one dram and
half: resin of Scammony, two scruples: Cinnamon, Ginger, Nutmegs, Galangal, of
each half a dram: red Coral prepared, half a scruple: conserve of Peony, half
an ounce: Oil of Sage, six drops: Sugar dissolved in waters of flowers of Lilly
Convally, and of the Lime tree, a sufficient quantity: make Morsells, dose half
an ounce: In our Pharmacopoeia and Doron, you will find some of Mynsichts, very
excellent for this purpose.

15. Purging pills: Take Pil. Cochie, two scruples: Pil. Arabicae, one scruple:
Troches Alhandal, three grains: Oil of Sage, one drop: mix and make twenty five
Pills, Or, Take Extract of Pil. Cochiae, half a dram: or two scruples: Extract
of black Hellebor, five grains: Oil of Rue, one drop: mix and make fifteen
Pills: But among all the purgatives Extract we know none better than Our Family
Pills, which we have constantly Used with wonderful success. It is a Medicament
that caries off all humors, works briskly, and yet without griping or making
sick, unless the Stomach be very foul.

16. From minerals etc. Some purge with Lapis Armenius given in three scruples
and mixed with Hira picra: verum in Comitialibus inveteratis (dixit Sennertus)
nullum adeo efficax medicamentum invenisse, ut hoc medicamentum purgans,
multosque se novisse desperatos ab alijs medicis, vel hoc solo persanatos
fuisse. Among Chymick and metalick Medicaments Antimony, and the preparations
thereof are highly commended, as the Vitrum, Flores, Crocus, etc. of which
latter the Aqua benedicta Rulandi is made: Mercurius Vitae also is in great
Estimation among some Physicians; but it ought to be well prepared, and very
cautiously given.

17. Whichsoever of the Medicaments here enumerated, or any other of like kind
not here named, the Physician shall be pleased to make use of, they are not
suddenly to be given over, but to be long used, as Galen himself admonishes, in
his counsel for the Cure of an Epileptick Child, where he commends a Medicament
of squills to be used at least for forty days, Oxymel of squills prepared with
Vinegar; Or rather the juice of squills with Honey in an Epilepsy, whose seat
is in the Genus nervosum, is very much praised being continued to be taken for
forty days or more, from two drams to two ounces, before dinner; and in strong
bodies also before Supper, a proper Purge being taken (in the use hereof) once
a week.

18. Among simple Medicaments Trallianus commends the roots of Pyrethrum, being
beaten into powder and taken with Honey, a spoonful thereof being taken at a
time, till eleven spoonfuls are taken at certain intervalls: experientia
(inquit) probatum est auxilium, ne ipsius utilitatem contemnas. But squills,
Pyrethrum, and such like hot Medicaments are not to be given but in bodies of a
Cold, humid, and Pituitous constitution, or where the Cause of the Disease
shall pertinaciously adhere to the inferior Venture: and then also, if they be
mixed with Specific, ksor proper Antepilepticks, they will yet be so much the
more powerful.

19. Now if by the continual use of Medicaments, the appetite to food should
be hurt, that at length, as the disease by degrees is overcome, will return
again of its own accord: yet however in the mean season it will be prudence in
the Physician at certain Intervalls to to desist from the other Medicaments,
and to exhibit such things as may corroberate or strengthen the Stomach; for if
that be overturned or weekned it can never perform its duty in the Concoction
and alteration of the designed Medicaments, whereby the greatest part of the
labor, pains, cost, and Medicines, will be bestowed in Vain.

20. The second part of the first Intention is performed by Sudorificks, which
send those noxious humors through the pores of the skin, which lay beyond the
reach of any purgative or Vomit. Here the Decoction of Lignum Guajacum has
place, and indeed it is no mean thing: for as Jacchinus testifies, by the use
hereof, with a drying and extenuating Diet, many Epilepticks have been
perfectly cured; but the Use thereof was continued not only for some days, but
for some weeks. Others there are which as highly commend the Extracts of Cardus
Ben. Calamus Aromaticus, and Gentian: and it is known by certain Experience,
that the Decoction of those three, being taken for an hundred days together has
cured highly Scorbutic Epilepticks, who had been given over as incurable by
several eminent and Learned men: but then, during the whole time of drinking of
that Decoction, they did continually every day, (all day long) chew Gentian in
their Mouths, which of how great virtue that alone thing is, in the Cure of
this disease, I dare not be bold to say, to speak the whole truth, least I
should be thought to Romance: if any one will but please to make the trial;
they may perhaps in less than a weeks time see the reason of the thing.

21. Antepileptick Sudorificks. Quercetanus in his Pharmacopaeia dagmatica
restituta, cap. 8. has this following preparation: Take raspings of Box-wood,
two ounces and half: raspings of Juniper-wood, roots of Peony, Misletoe of the
Oak, of each an ounce and half: Lignum Rhodium; Hartshorn, of each five drams:
Ivory, China roots, of each half an ounce: seeds of Card. Ben, Citron peels, of
each an ounce: digest twenty four hours in warm (Peony) water eight pints: boil
to the consumption of a third part, and at the end of the boiling add flowers
of the Line-tree, and of Lilly Convally, of each two pugils: then strain it out
for use: dose five or six ounces: Bezoar stone, also Pulvis exchelis Cancrorum
compositus, and Bezoar minerale, are of good use. To these add decoctions of
Sarsa parilla, of China, of Sassafras, of the wood of Misletoe of the Oak;
roots of Cink-foil and Tormentil, with other things of like nature. Or this of
Sennertus: Take raspings of Guajacum, one pound: Misletoe of the Oak, three
ounces: Peony roots, one ounce: Fountain water, twelve pints: infuse all twenty
four hours; boil to the consumption of a third part, and then strain it out for
use: Dose six ounces to provoke sweat: the wood, or ingredients may be boiled
again in fresh Water, for the common drink of the Sick.

22. Among Chemical Sudorificks, we commend the Spiritus ex tribus, Tinctura
diaphoretica Paracelsi, spirit of Carduus Benedictus, spirit of Elder, the two
latter of which may be drunk one ounce at a time, with two scruples of the
spirit of Guajacum in any convenient Vehicle: to these add spirit of Tartar
compound two scruples for a dose in some proper liquor, Volatile salts of
Hartshorn, of Amber, of Man's skull, and of Vipers; Bezoar minerale simple and
solar, fixed Antimony, or Antimony Diaphoretick given in a little Venice
Treacle: Or Treacle water with Mithridate. There are many more of excellent
use, which you may find out by a little pains in searching.

23. The third part of the first Intention is performed by particular
evacuations of the Brain, by Errhins, Sternutatories, Apophlegmatisms or
Masticatories, Gargarisms, and suchlike.

24. Errhins: Take juyces of Rue and Beets, of each half an ounce: Elder and
sweet Marjoram water, of each one ounce: seeds of Peony and of Nigella, of each
a scruple: mix them, and let it be drawn up the Nostrills: Take white or
Rhenish wine, three ounces: Euphorbium, two grains: mix and dissolve for an
Errhine; it is a powerful one: Take juyces of Peony and sow Bread, of each half
an ounce: juyces of sweet Marjoram and Rue, of each two drams: syrup of
buck-thorn, one dram and half: spirit of Juniper, half an ounce: mix them.

25. Sternutatories: Take Nutmegs, Peony roots, of each one dram: white Pepper,
Pyrethrum, of each one scruple: white Hellebor, half a scruple: mix and make a
powder: But the most excellent of all is that of Deckers, which in his
Exercitation, he gives directions to make thus: Taken Turbith minerale, one
dram: powder of Liquorice, three drams: powder of Rosemary flowers, one dram
and half: mix them well: it is of Miraculous operation.

26. Apophlegmatisms: Take Nutmegs, roots of Pyrithrum, roots of Peony and of
the true Acorus, of each one dram: Rocket seed, two drams: with Mastick, a
sufficient quantity, make pastills or troches, weighing each two scruples: to
be held in the Mouth and chewed: Take Galangal, two drams: Cinnamon, Cloves, of
each half a dram: Cubebs, Gentian, Peony roots, of each a scruple: Anicardiums,
roots of Pyrethrum, of each half a dram: sugar two drams: distilled Oil of
Cloves, and of Cinnamon, of each two drops: with syrup of Staechas, and the
whites of Eggs make Troches, for Masticatories.

27. Gargarisms: Trallianus commends a Gargarism made of Hyssop, Penny-royall,
and dry Figs, being boiled in a sufficient quantity of spring water, and
strained for use: Or you may gargarize with this: Take Pyrethrum, an ounce and
half: Rosemary, Sage, Hyssop, Rue, of each two pugills: make a decoction in
water, strain, and mix with a quart thereof, Vinegar of Roses, Honey of Roses,
of each two ounces: for a Gargle. Or Take Rue, Betony, Sage, Hyssop, of each
half a handful: roots of Peony and Orrice, of each half an ounce: Acorus,
Pyrethrum, Peony seeds, of each two drams: Nutmegs, a dram and half: make a
decoction in water; to a pint of which add Oxymel of squills, two ounces: Honey
of Resemary-flowers, one ounce: mix and make a Gargarism: more of these you may
see in Vntzerus de Epilepisa, page 194.

28. For this purpose, also where the Seat of the Distemper is in the Brain or
Head, you may use actual Cauteries, which have a mighty power, of attenuating
and discussing of humors though firmly impacted in the part, and this more
especially if they be applied to the Coronal Sutures; for thereby the matter
causing the Epilepsy is dissipated. But in the doing hereof Caution ought to be
used, lest you hurt the Membranes which lie adjacent to the Brain, or have a
near vicinity thereto, whereby great mischief succeeds. You may also in the
same case apply the Seton, or make Fontanels or Issues in proper parts, and the
latter may be done either by Incision, or with an actual or potential Cautery,
for thereby the Morbifick cause is at were drained forth.

29. These things being done, which are for removing of the near Cause, the
next thing which we are to consider of, (which is the Third Intention) is the
Exhibition of Specificks, or proper Antepileptick Medicaments, the which we
shall consider either as simple or compound.

30. Among the Simple Medicaments, these following are most famed; the Roots,
Flowers, and Seeds of Peony, gathered when the Sun is in Leo, at noon-time, at
the New Moon: But Hercules Saxonia advises to gather them in April, the Sun
being in Aries, and the Moon at the full, which is the better Advice. Misleto
of the Oak, Hazle or Tile Tree, given from two scruples to a dram in powder,
which has cured many. Rice both Garden and Wild, the latter of which is much
commended by Trallianus. Polly-montain, Castoreum, which may be given from a
scruple to two in any fit Vehicle: Elks hoof, Man's Skull, but chiefly the
triangular bone. Roots of Pyrethrum and Eryngo, which are commended by many.
Roots of Bryony, which has done many Cures of this kind by taking a dram of it
in powder every morning in wine, for a year together, as Fontanus prescribes,
Vervain gathered (the Sun being in Aries) and taken with a few Peony seeds, is
approved by Mizaldus, being taken in some Epileptick Wine. Wild Valerian taken
to a dram, is mightly commended by Columna, and therewith many have been cured.
To these things may be added, Amber, Coral, Emerald, Lillys-Convally, Tile
flowers, Radix Dentariae, The Bladder of a wild Boar, dried and poudred,
Hartshorn, Rennet of a Hare, Hazel wood, Peacocks-Dung, and various
Preparations of all these things. Hippomanes dried and poudred, is reported to
be a certain and wonderful Experiment. Plantain or its Juice, is said to be of
excellent use by Scribonius Largus; and Paracelsus cured several therewith.
Livers of Frogs green and taken in watery places given to about forty in number
is commended by Hartman as a thing almost infallible: so also the Liver reasted
of an Ass, or of a Goat, of a Thrush, and of a Bear, have equal Commendations.
More over, the Blood and Flesh of a Weazel, the Heart of a Wolf; the Testicles
of of a Wild Goat, the Heart of a Hare, of a Swallow, of a Stork, of a Vulture,
Mares Milk, Storks Dung, and the Worms found in the Bryar Balls are all
commended by Florentinus.

31, Among simple Chemical things these following are in most Estimation: The
Volatile Spirit of Vitriol, Oleum Lunae, and Oils out of the most of the things
before enumerated, chiefly the Magistery, Powers, Oil, and Volatile Salt of
Amber, Oil of Box-wood, Oil of the Hazel-wood, (so much commended by Rulandus)
Spirit, Oil, and Volatile Salt of Man's Skul, and of a Hearts Head, as also of
the Horns. Tincture and Magistery of Coral: Magistery, Oil, Spirit, Sal, and
Powers of Elks hoofs: Water, Spirit, and Salt of Black-Cherries, of the Flowers
of the Tile-Tree, of Peony and of Lilly-Convally: Spirit of Radix Dentariae,
etc.

32. Of Compound Specificks there are many: and also many forms of them, as
Compound Waters, Syrups, Pouders, Electuaries, Rouls etc, of all which we will
give you some singular Examples from the most learned and famous Sennertus; in
imitation of which, every Artist may by the Exercise of his own Ingenuity, and
the Necessities emerging, form or find out many others.

one scruple: Conserves of Primroses and of Tile-flowers, of each two drams:
Sugar (dissolved in Peony water) two ounces: mix and make Morsells.

46. Now concerning the use of these Medicaments, this is principally to be
noted, that in this (as in all other difficult Diseases,) you are not suddenly
to desist from the use of these Remedies propounded: for it oftentimes happens
that little profit is found at first, and yet by a long continuation of the use
of the same Remedy, a Cure may succeed.

47. For Topics or External medicaments these are Commended: Take Oil of
Nutmegs by Expression one dram: Ambergrise, Musk, of each six grains: Civet,
ten grains: Oils of Amber and of Marjoram, of each a sufficient quantity: mix
them to anoint the Nostrills with. Or thus: Take Balsam of Rue, one dram: of

Galliae moschatae, Cloves, of each one dram: Myrrh, Frankincense, of each half
a dram: Musk, four grains: Oil of Nutmegs by Expression, half a dram: Marjoram
water, a sufficient quantity, mix and make Pomambers: But above all external
things the Potestates or powers of Amber are found to have the prevalency,
being bathed on the Coronal Sutures, Temples, Nostrills nape of the Neck, Spina
dorsi, Stomach, and Pulses of the wrists, morning and night for several days
together.

48. The fourth and last intention of Cure, is to corroborate or strengthen and
confirm the Brain, after that the morbifick cause by the use of the former
things is taken away. Sennertus approves of this. Take roots of Swallow-wort,
of Elecampane, of Devills-bit, of Cloves, of Peony, of each six drams:
Bay Berries, two drams: Sage, Time, Rosemary flowers, of each one dram: species
Diamoschi Dulcis, Diapliris, Dianthos, of each half a dram: mix in a fine
powder. Or this, of Nevius: Take Peony seeds, bones of Harts-horns (viz. those
at the roots of the horn) Ivory, of each half a dram: Man's skull, Elks hoofs,
Pearls, of each two drams: make all into a fine powder.

49. A potion for the same purpose: Take waters of Magpies and of Swallows, of
each two ounces: Epileptick water of Langius, spirit of Black-cherries, of each
one ounce: Essence of Peony-flowers, three drams: Tincture of Coral, half a
dram: extracts of Dittany and Rue, of each four grains: distilled Oil of Sage,
two drops: Sugar tabulated and pearled five drams: mix them together.

50. The following Electuary is said to be of Excellent use: Take Mithridate,
electuary of Eryngo roots, of each one ounce and half: Conserves of Betony and
Rosemary, of each two ounces and half: powder of Sassafras, six drams: juyces
of Rue and Marjoram, of each half an ounce: Castoreum, three drams: Mans-skull,
Elks-hoof, of each two drams: roots and seeds of Peony, seeds of Nigella and of
wild Rue, Roots of Pyrethrum, Hyssop, of each one dram: with Honey of squills a
sufficient quantity, make all into an Electuary, which insolate for a month.
Dose two or three drams.

51. These Rouls are also commended: Take species Diamoschi Dulcis, diapliris,
Diapeoniae, Misleto of the Oak, Carduus Benedictus, of each one scruple: seeds
of Peony, of Citrons, roots of Pyrethrum, of each half a dram: white Amber,
Cloves, Nutmegs, Hartshorn, Man's skull prepared, of each ten grains: with
white sugar (dissolved in Lilly-convally water) a sufficient quantity, make
Rouls.

52. A Confortative Balsam: Take Oil of Nutmegs by Expression, one dram: Civet,
one scruple: Musk, Ambergrise, of each six grains: Oils of Lavender, of
Marjoram, of Rue, and of Amber, of each six drops: mix and make a Balsam, to
anoint the places aforenamed with: also it may be given inwardly morning and
night, from half a scruple to a scruple, drinking after it a little
Black-cherry wine, or Epileptick water of Langius, or strong Cinnamon water.

53. Over the Coronal sutures you may also apply this Emplaster of Sennertus:
Take Oils of Castor, of Rue, and of Orrice, of each one ounce: distilled Oil of
Amber, half a dram: roots and seeds of Peony, Misleto of the Oak, of each one
dram: seeds of Nigella and of Rue, Castoreum, flowers of Lavender, of the
Tile-tree, of Lillys-Convally, and of Arabian Staechas, of each one scruple:
with wax and Rosin of each a sufficient quantity, make an Emplaster to be
applied as aforesaid. Or you may apply that of Franciscus Valesius formerly
described in sect. 73.. 12. of this chapter, which is said alone to cure the
Disease, and to strengthen the Head and Brain in such sort, as that it shall
never return any more.

54. This Disease is sometimes Cured by Amulets hung about the Neck and Wrists,
made of the roots and seeds of Peony, Or Beads made of the Misletoe or Elder
which grows out of a Willow, Or of Coral, Emeralds, Jasper, and those other
things mentioned sect. 150.. 88. In which section we have treated of the
general Cure of this Disease, and to which we refer you, as to a place where
you will have many things of singular Use, not so much as named in the
Paragraphs of this present section.

CHAP. VI. Of CONVULSIONS.
The AUTHORS Observations.
I. A Convulsion in a middle Aged Man proceeding from the Cholick.

1. A Man about thirty eight years of Age, having had many Paroxysms of the
Wind Cholick, at length they became so extreme as to bring him into certain
fits, and so pass off: I was sent for in one of those fits, and when I came to
see the Sick, I presently found they were Convulsive; and that the Convulsion
was universal over the whole Body.

2. The whole body was cold, as if it was almost dead, and drawn up on a heap,
the calves of the Legs were contracted into hard Knots of a great magnitude, the
Hams were drawn up, the Belly was contracted into a heap, his Back was bent,
Neck drawn aside, his Fingers Hands and Arms shrunk up, and his Mouth writhed
in a very odd posture.

3. The condition the Sick lay in was very lamentable, and deplorable, and in
all Appearance nothing but Death could be expected; yet the man having had
already several of the like fits, and being naturally of a strong habit and
constitution of Body, and not much brought down thereby, I doubted not, but if
we could but restore him out of the present fit, that there might be sufficient
hopes of recovery: but the great danger lay in the Extremity of the fit.

4. To reduce him to himself we conveyed as well as we could into his Mouth
this following dose: Take spiritus Carminativus, half an ounce: Powers of
Caraways thirty drops: mix them: it was forced down his Throat; after which his
Bowels began suddenly to make a noise; and in about two minutes time he broke
wind both upwards and downwards.

5. All the Convulsed members I caused to be very well bathed with the Powers
of Amber by a chafing dish of Coals, and by the use of them in less than half
an hour we were Instrumental in restoring of this lamentable spectacle: his
Head, Temples, Forehead, Nostrills, Cheeks, and Lips I caused to be bathed with
the powers of Rosemary, so that in a very short time he came very well to
himself again.

6. But by reason his Body was bound up, or very Costive, I caused this
following Clyster to be exhibited: Take Decoctum Commune, a pint: Oil Olive, or
Oil of Bay Berries, two drams: Chemical Oil of Anniseeds, six drops, or forty
drops of the Potestates or powers: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, two ounces:
Manna, an ounce and half: mix and dissolve, and exhibit it warm: This gave six
or seven stools, and brought away a great quantity, not only of hardened
Excrements, but also of Viscous, slimy, green, yellow, blew, and otherwise
discolored matter; so that the Sick confessed himself to be extremely eased.

7. Being thus well recovered my next care was to preserve him for the future
from such like Accidents, and therefore I ordered the following Diet, to be
taken as his ordinary Drink: Take spring water, eight quarts: Juniper berries
well bruised four ounces: Liquorice rasped, Figs slit, Raisons of the sun
stoned, Currants, of each two ounces: Caraways bruised, one ounce: Fennel
seeds, half an ounce: boil all together to the Consumption of about three
quarts, then strain, let it settle well, decant the clear, and sweeten it with
white Sugar: then bottle it up and let him drink it as his ordinary Drink.

8. But because I saw there was a preternatural matter lodged in the Stomach,
which ought to be taken away, and which continually afflicted him, and
oftentimes stirred up such like fits as the former; I evacuated his Stomach
with the following Dose: Take Carduus water a pint: Infusion of Crocus
metallorum, one ounce: Salt of Vitriol two scruples: mix them for a draught:
This wrought effectually with him, so that he evacuated both upwards and
downwards a very large quantity of filthy green, and otherwise discolored
matter: this dose was twice more repeated upon every fourth day.

9. And that we might be sure to take away the proximate cause wholly, I
ordered him to take of my Family pills, with Aloes once a week, for six or
seven weeks together, which he exactly performed, whereby his Body was
perfectly cleansed and all that matter which formerly used to Gripe him, was
now perfectly taken away, whereby the cause of the Convulsion was radically
removed.

10. However I was not wanting as to the Convulsion it self; and therefore I
caused all the Convulsed parts, and other parts in which was any weakness or
feebleness to be bathed Morning and Night with the powers of Amber: these
things had indeed such an Effect upon him, as that he was never after troubled
with any more Convulsive fits; though yet the wind would sometimes a little
disturb him, but nothing like as in former times.

11. However, to prevent this, I caused him constantly Morning, Noon, and
Night, to take of this following Electuary: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, four
ounces: powder of Bay Berries, half an ounce: powers of Carraways of Rosemary,
and of Sassafras, of each three drams: mix them: dose as much as a hazle nut,
drinking a little glass of warm diet before mentioned, or of mul'd Sack, after
the same.

12. His Backbone from the Vertebrae of the Neck to the Os Coccygis, as also
the whole region of of the Abdomen were more especially and carefully bathed
with the aforementioned powers of Amber twice a day, for about fourteen days;
he by using these means was perfectly restored to health, so as that his fits
never returned any more.

13. By this very method I cured two other Men, and one Gentlewoman, which were
all afflicted in like manner, with Convulsions proceeding from the Wind
Cholick, they were all so admirably cured and restored that none of them
(except the Woman) had a second fit, after we had began to attempt the Cure:
and she had but one fit after, which is a thing worthy the remarking: Also one
I cured simply by taking some few doses of my Family Pills: and bathing all the
places affected with only the powers of Amber, used as aforesaid morning and
night.

II. Convulsions caused in a little Boy from Worms.

1. A Child of about seven years of Age often fell into Convulsion fits; and no
cause could be discerned whence they should proceed: several Physicians and
Doctors were sent for, yet so abstruse was the reason of those fits, that they
could discover nothing from whence they could proceed: however they attempted
the Cure, and many things were given, but all in Vain; although the means was
continued for some months together.

2. At length I was desired to give the Child a visit, (which was in the
absence of the Paroxysm) but to all appearance he ailed nothing, except when I
came near him, I found his Breath to stink most egregiously: I enquired of his
Parents whether that symptom had been from his Birth, or only came lately by
Accident: and they told me that they had not observed it in their Child for
above five or six months, which made them also concerned whence that should
arise.

3. I further enquired of them, if the Child never complained of his
Belly-aking; they told me, That was ordinary with him every Morning, and the
only complaint which he had, which they thought proceeded from wind in his
Stomach, for that after eating he was wont to be very well again, except at
such times as his Convulsion fits seized, which was always at uncertain hours.

4. Upon this I conceived that all the former Doctors and Physicians had
hitherto perfectly mistaken the Cause: I then told his Parents, that I much
feared that the Child was troubled with Worms, and therefore enquired again
whether he had ever voided any or not: they answered me, No, never any such
thing being observed to come from him.

5. However I was strongly persuaded that Worms were the chief causes of that
Convulsive disposition, and this I was the more persuaded to, because by his
Friends relation, he would not only startle much in his sleep, but those
Convulsive fits would also seiz him when he was fast asleep, which to me was no
small argument of Worms.

6. I provided therefore against them: and in the first place, I ordered the
Parents to give the Child of my Family pills with Aloes, for that I knew by
manifold experience that no better Medicament could be given in the World to
remove that cause: they were given three little Pills at a time, and the second
dose brought away two large worms above seven inches long by Vomit: and by
Stool he had six or eight such other Worms; besides a great number of little
small worms of about an inch long.

7. I ordered the use of these Pills to be continued so long till the Child
ceased to evacuate any Worms at all, which was not till he had taken the ninth
dose; after that he avoided no more: the number of great Worms which he avoided
was about seventeen, the number of the lesser (they were so many) could never
be told: he took the Pills however thirteen or fourteen times, for security
sake, but after the ninth dose no more worms came away; the doses of the pills
were repeated after every third or fourth day: they wrought very well, and
without the least griping of the Bowels of of the Child.

8. Outwardly, I also caused the Stomach and Belly, and all the Convulsed parts
to be bathed morning and evening very well with the Powers of Amber, which was
don for six or eight days together: and by the use of this means the Child was
perfectly freed from all his Convulsion fits, and from thence forth rested very
quietly in his bed, without any disturbance in his sleep as formerly.

9. However for comforting and restoring the tone of the Inwards parts, and to
prevent the breeding of more Worms for the future, I ordered the following
thing: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, two ounces: Bay Berries in subtle powder,
two drams: red Diaphoretick Mercury, salt of Man's skull, Ox horns in subtle
powder, Bezoar stone, of each half a dram: powers of Cloves a sufficient
quantity: mix all together and make an Electuary: of this he took a scruple
every night going to Bed.

10. Several of the like examples of Convulsions proceeding from Worms, have
fallen under my Cure, all which I either cured simply with some few doses of my
Family Pills above named, or with the use of them and the Powers of Amber
aforesaid. And now I am speaking of their effects in killing of Worms; I care
not much if I relate part of a Letter sent to me by one John Mouse a Country
Physician now living at Wellingbrough in Northamptonshire, dated the 11. of
January, Anno 1679/80. his words are these. All the Excellent Virtues of the
Family Pills I am not able to declare: this I can speak upon my own Experience,
that from a sick Patient of mine troubled with Worms, they brought away a
joynted Worm, of about an hundred foot long.

III. Convulsions in a Woman troubled with Hysteric fits: as also in a Maiden
whose Courses were stopped.

1. A young Woman of about twenty six years of Age, of a Melancholy habit of
body, had been for more than two years troubled with Hysteric fits: she
continuing without cure, the fits came to that Extremity that after a
Convulsive manner they drew up all her Body into an heap, with an exceeding
great Groaning, and almost intolerable pain, chiefly in the Bowels and
Mesentery.

2. I was at last called to her, when she was in the extremity of one of her
fits, at which time her ordure and urine came from her insensibly, and she was
in an extreme cold sweat, striving within herself as if the pains of Death had
been upon her: how long the fit had been upon her, I cannot exactly tell; but
wh^lst I was considering what to do, she came to herself again.

3. However for the preventing of the l^ke for the future, it was necessary
that some speedy course should be taken; and therefore in the first place, I
caused all the convulsed parts parts to be extremely well bathed with the
powers of Amber above mentioned, and this to be done Morning and Night, for at
least twelve or fourteen days together: this ordered,

4. I caused this following Clyster forthwith to be administered: Take Decoctum
Amarum, one pint: infusion of Crocus Metallorum, Oil of Camomil, choice Honey,
of each two ounces: Powers of Amber, two drams: mix all for a Clyster, to be
given warm: It cleansed the Abdomen well, and brought away a great quantity of
greenish slimy matter, by which she found her self much eased.

5. This done, I ordered her to take a dose of five or six of my Family Pills
with Aloes, every fourth or fifth morning, for 7 or 8 weeks together: I ordered
her to take them for so long time, for that I knew the Disease to be Chronick
and stubborn, and that there was a great degeneration of the Nervous juice by
the superabundancy of Vicious humors; of which unless the body was perfectly
cleansed no hope of Cure could be expected to succeed, which I knew these Pills
(being taken for some time) would most admirably accomplish; nor in this thing
(in this my Patient) was I mistaken; for they wrought very kindly with her,
without any griping in the least, and brought away a vast quantity of filthy
and putrefied humors, even to my wonder and amazement, by the use of which she
not only grew more cheerful and lightsom, but she also found her self
apparently the better, and her fits when they came upon her, was not with the
quarter part of the Vehemence with which they afflicted her formerly.

6. Then for the abating of the Hysteric Distemper, I ordered the following
composition: Take powers of Amber, one ounce: powers of Guajacum, of Elks
hoofs, of each two drams; Powers of Man's skull, one dram mix them: of this she
took between twenty and thirty drops at a time, in a Glass of Rhenish wine and
sugar, morning and night, so that after she had begun to take them, she had
never more than three fits, and has remained perfectly free from them for more
then ten years space.

7. But for fourteen days together, half an hour before Dinner, she took this:
Take salt of Man's skull, Volatile salt of Hartshorn, of each eight grains:
Nutmegs, Cloves in powder, of each ten grains: mix them: and by the only taking
of these things she was restored to her pristin Health.

8. Now of how great Virtues these Family Pills are in restoring such as have
Hysteric fits complicated with other Diseases, I will relate part of a Letter
from one Richard Hilton of Middleton in Somersetshire, dated the first of
January Anno 1679/80. his words are these. Sir, I cannot but give you an
account what a great cure your Family Pills have wrought upon my wife, who has
been long afflicted with Hysteric fits, as also with a Consumption and the
Scurvey, she has tried almost all things in vain, and was then (when she took
your Pills) given over by all Our Physicians as perfectly uncurable, upon her
first taking of them she found more good than she ever did by any thing given
her before: and by her continuing to take them according to your directions,
she is now become perfectly well.

9. A Maiden Gentlewoman also troubled with Convulsion fits from an Hysteric
cause, I cured by the same method as the former, and in about two months time
restored her to perfect health; but she having an obstruction of her Terms, I
did over and above prescribe the following Medicaments: Take Zedoary, round
Bithwort root, Bay Berries, of each one ounce: Dittany of Crete, Saffron,
Borax, of each six drams: Nigella seeds, Calamint, Savin dried, of each four
drams: red Myrrh, Jallap, of each two drams: make all into a fine powder and
mix them: of this powder she took half a dram an hour before Dinner, and as
much a little before Supper, in any convenient liquor for seven or eight days
before the time of their due flowing.

IV. Convulsion fits in a Man fifty years of Age, arising from the stone in the
Reins.

1. This Man having been for about eighteen years past troubled extremely with
the stone in the Reins, ran up and down from one Physician to another to seek
for remedy, but all in vain: at length his Disease became so Vehement upon him,
that nature was no longer able to sustain the burden, without seeming to sink
under it; so that upon any occasional Paroxysm of the stone he fell into
dreadful Convulsion fits, which could not be beheld without horror in the
bystanders.

2. Upon this a certain friend of the Sick requested that I should be sent for:
but the man being exceeding Poor, and so not able to give a Physician his fee,
some of his Relations declined it, until a Gentlewoman (a mere stranger to the
Sick, and to me yet unknown) proffered upon her own Generosity to give the
reward: upon this I was sent for, and viewing the Sick, saw his condition very
strange and deplorable: the Lady requested my opinion, gave me three pieces of
Gold or Guines, and bad me do the best for the Poor Creature I could, and if
things succeeded well she would further reward me.

3. Hereupon I attempted to do some thing, but found that (whatsoever was
necessary to be don, or whatsoever the rules of Art prescribed,) I must be
forced to give my Patient an Opiate; or else it would be impossible for him to
continue long, but that the strength of his Convulsions would infallably carry
him off, in spite of whatsoever we should be able to do.

4. For this cause sake I gave him a Laudanum extremely well prepared, and
loaded with Volatile Salts, and completed with Camphir and Oil of Wormwood
(which Medicament you may have exactly made and prepared either by my self, Or
by John Hollier a Chemist living in George Yard near brooken wharf in
Thames Street London.) of this Laudanum I gave him at first two grains, which
gave him some ease, and which dose he continued about a week, at the end of
which I increased the dose half a grain more: at fourteen days end I gave him
three grains.

5. After this manner I continued the use of this Medicament for several weeks,
still augmenting of it half a grain every week, whereby the miserable poor Man
had not only ease for the present, but we perfectly mastered the Convulsions in
about seven weeks time, and freed him from the danger of Death by those
Paroxysms: upon this the Sick would never go to Bed, without taking a Pill of
his Opiate, for if he did, within a day or two he was sure to have a fit of the
stone: and now his resolutions were set, that he would take them all the Days
of his life, rather than loose the ease and happiness which that Medicine
procured him.

6. He continued the use of it so long till by augmenting of it half a grain in
a week, he took half a dram for a dose at night going to Bed; at what time he
then began to take it diminishing the dose in like manner half a grain in a
week, till he had brought it back again to seven grains, at which quantity he
stuck for a long time: now it is observable, that during all the time of his
taking of this Ladanum he voided every night a large quantity of red Gravel,
and in his own opinion much more Urine than he drank drink, which was the first
motive, which induced him to lessen his dose.

7. However now and than by pretermitting the use of this Laudanum, we found
that although by the use thereof he was freed from his dreadful Convulsion
fits, and from the extreme Anguish and Pains of the stone, as also from his
stoppage of Urine, and painful making water, yet the true and Essential cause
of those Pains remained, wherefore my business was next to consult what was
most rational either to dissolve any Coagulum in the Reins or Bladder, and to
prevent the like concretion for the future.

8. I advised him to many things by which he confessed he found much good, as
first the Decoction or juice of Camomil, which he used successfully for a
pretty while: secondly, being weary of taking that, I advised him to take the
Infusion or Juice of large Onions mixed with a sufficient quantity of White or
Rhenish wine, and Oil of sweet Almonds, by the use of which he confessed he found
a vast and singular advantage: moreover, I ordered him to make Onions, Leeks,
Garlic, or Shelots, the only sauce for, all the food he eat. Thirdly, I
advised him to take the Distilled water of Hydropiper or biting Arsmart, by the
use of which he also confessed he had much relief. Fourthly, I caused him (after
the use of all those things) to take Egg-shels calcined ten or twelve days in a
potters Furnace; about a scruple or half a dram at a time every Morning
fasting, in any convenient Vehicle, and to drink after the same a little Gill
of spirit of Juniper. Fifthly, I ordered (after the taking of all the former
things) Winter Cherries in fine powder, from a scruple to half a dram to be
infused 48 hours in White or Rhenish wine, half a pint; and then the powder and
Wine to be drunk off together in the Morning fasting, which he did for some
weeks. Sixthly, The taking of choice Oil of salt (as many drops as he could
well bear) in a glass of Sack or other wine, which he took for many months: all
these things were used in the Order recited, together with Powers of
Juniper Berries, sometimes in Persicary water, sometimes in white or Rhenish
wine, and sometimes in Sack, from the use of which the Sick had not only
manifest ease, with a perpetual flux of Gravel, but was also in his own opinion
much better in respect of the stone it self: yet this he found, if he abstained
long from some of the things above named, his Lithontriptick pains would
return again, and that with Vehemence.

9. I now began to consult upon his last remedy, seeing that all the former
things had not the desired Effects which I could have wished for; at length I
concluded upon this Compositum: Take choice Venice Turpentine, eight ounces:
Liquid storax, two ounces: Camphir, one ounce: (dissolved in a sufficient
quantity of Oil of Juniper-beries) Cochenele in fine powder, half an ounce:
dissolve the storax in the Turpentine over a gentle heat; then take it off the
fire, and being almost cold mix therewith the dissolved Camphir and cochenele
in powder: stir them well together till they are perfectly mixed and put it into
a Gally pot for use. dose Morning and Evening as much as a hazel nut in a
Wafer, or rolled up in Sugar.

10. This very quantity cured the poor Man, so that after the taking of it,
ceasing from all other Medicines, no symptom of his Disease ever returned any
more: but he by degrees augmented his dose till he took of it Morning and
Evening as much as a very large Nutmeg or more: the Man having been well some
months, five pieces of Gold was sent me sealed up in piece of paper, by a
footboy, the person unknown to me to this day, but I much suspect it to be
from the Charitable and Religiously disposed Lady above mentioned, I might here
philosophize upon the reason of this Cure, and the simples of the last
Compositum, but for fear of being too tedious (seeing the matter is obvious) I
shall now forbear.

11. A Brick-layer who had been for about fifteen years troubled with the
Stone, and gone from Physician to Physician without hope of remedy, I perfectly
cured (after three or four times purging with my Family Pills) with only the
last prescription: and he has remained now well several months.

12. Another man who had also been exceedingly afflicted for many years with
the stone, I perfectly cured with this following Medicament: Take Balsam of
Peru, eight ounces: Liquid storax, two ounces: Camphir (disolved as aforesaid)
one ounce: Chochenel in fine powder, half an ounce: mix them into a body
according to Art: dose the quantity aforementioned. These are great Medicines
(though in themselves but mean things) and therefore not to be disregarded or
despised.

V. Convulsion fits in a young Lady arising from Pains of the stone, or Gravel
in the Reins and Bladder.

1. This young Gentlewoman had been long tormented with the stone or Gravel in
the Reins or Bladder, and for more than twenty weeks had lain in a very
miserable condition, so that at last her Disease increasing upon her and coming
to Extremities, she fell into Convulsion fits, which followed her so
excessively, that she would have sometimes fourteen or sixteen fits in the space
of twenty four hours time; these in a few days rendered her condition both
dangerous of desperate.

2. Her Pulses which used to be equal, strong, and rather quick than slow,
became very irregular, faint or weak, and so low, as scarcely to be felt: her
Stomach was wholly taken away; a vehement Vomiting had seized her, together
with faintness or weakness, a trembling of the whole body, and extreme cold
sweats: Her ordour and Urine, were also black as a Coal.

3. In this miserable condition her Friends scarcely knew what to do, many
Physicians were sent for, and that of the greatest note, whose judgments were
requested, but as they came severally, so their judgments were diverse, to the
great dissatisfaction not only of the sick Patient, but of her relations; One
said, It was an high Scurvy, and that it would be long and of difficult Cure:
another, that it was Hypochondriack melancholy: another, that it was an
Hysteric disease: another, that she had an Ulcer in her spleen: another, that
her Liver was almost wasted, and that she had not so much of it left as two of
his little Fingers came to, and therefore must irrecoverably die: etc. insomuch
that the proverb Quot homines tot capita, quot mentes tot Sententiae, was never
more exactly verified than in these kind of men; every one of them of a
different judgment, and all of them vastly different from the Truth.

4. Among the number of the rest I was at last thought of, and at the request
of the sick Patient sent for: when I came, I began to examine the symptoms, and
found present a great stoppage of Urine, with a vehement pain and scalding
thereof, and what water came from her, came by drops, by reason of which, and
the extremity of the Dolor, the sick fell into Convulsion fits, which lasted
upon her for a quarter of an hour or more; which fit going off, the sick would
be pleasant and cheerful again, but of a sudden, upon the exciting of those
pains, the fit would return again, which were accompanied with all the symptoms
first above related: after a little consideration, I concluded them to be
Convulsion fits, arising from Distempers of the reins or bladder, which the
spasms or contraction of the parts gave demonstration of.

5. This as it agreed most with reason and truth, so it was a very satisfactory
judgment to those about the sick, and therefore the Patient was forthwith
committed to my charge; and I was requested to use the uttermost of skill to
restore her: her condition was truly desperate, which made me loath to engage,
lest dying under my hands, I should reap discredit thereby: this they told me
should be no discouragement to me; they requested me to do my best, they were
willing to trust her to God, and me: and if that she dyed, yet I should be
blameless, for as much as it was the judgments of all other men; and if she did
well, it would make much to my honor, credit and reputation.

6. Upon these Entreaties I undertook to do what good I could to the sick: I
perceived that slime and gravel were the principal things causing the
obstruction, or at most only some little stones, about the bigness of gray
pease, some of which by the use the following Medicines came afterward from
her. But my greatest care was to give the sick immediate ease, for which I was
forced to give her of my Guttae Vitae or Cordial Drops (the composition and
preparation of which you have in our Doron Medicum, lib. 1. cap. 22. sect. 170.
dose) twenty five drops in a little Sack: this gave her some relief: and by the
using thereof for three or four days, we took off (in a great measure,) the
violence of the Convulsion.

7. But finding that great sickness at heart, oppression at Stomach, and
continual disposition to Vomit, remain upon her, I was resolved to try a
rougher Medicament, far from the Indications present, it was apparently
manifested that the Stomach was exceeding foul, and much afflicted by the
Viscous matter therein contained, and therefore I exhibited this: Take Vinum
Benedictum, half an ounce: sal Vitriol, half a dram: mix them: and give them in
a glass of Wine.

8. By the use of this Medicament the sick had, five or six gentle Vomits, and
as many stools: it was repeated four times in all: once every other day,
whereby a vast quantity of Viscous phlegm was brought off from the Stomach,
twelve pounds by weight, at which I could not but wonder: hence appeared in
part the reason of her Vomiting, and, in part, of her Convulsion fits, for the
whole concavity of the Stomach was as it were glazed with this cold phlegm, and
viscous matter now brought away, and indeed after the first Vomit, the young
Lady had no more of her Convulsion fits: and although thereby her Pains of the
stone were not taken away, yet they were very much diminished, to my very great
satisfaction.

9. The hopes of life now were not small, the Pulses were restored, the black
colors of her Urine and Ordure were changed, her vomiting ceased, and a good
Stomach was now begat in her, who for several weeks together had eaten nothing
at all to speak of: I began now to think of taking away the root of the first
cause, but withal to comfort and restore the Tone of the Stomach, which was
depraved by reason of that large quantity of cold Viscous phlegm lodged in it;
and in some little measure hurt by the exhibition of so many Vomits.

10. For the first intention I gave her this: Take Powers of Juniper Berries,
four ounces: Ens Veneris, half an ounce: mix and dissolve as much as you can,
by shaking them together: dose half a spoonful in a little glass of Sack twice
a day, viz. Morning and Evening: in the intermediate parts of the day, for
restoration of the Stomach, I ordered her the powers of Cloves to be given
also, three four or five times a day or oftener, a quarter of a spoonful at a
time in a glass of Sack, from the use of which things she confessed she found
much comfort, also for change of Medicaments, I further prescribed this: Take
spirit of Angelica the greater Composition, four ounces: Oil of Cinnamon, half
a dram: mix them by shaking: of this she took half a spoonful at a time in a
glass of Sack, now and then, sometimes of this, sometimes of the powers of
Cloves, by the use of which, her Stomach was not only comforted and restored,
but her Heart was corroborated, and her spirits mightily revived, so that now
she no longer doubted of her recovery.

11. By the Continual use of the powers of Juniper Berries and Ens Veneris, a
large quantity of red Gravel came from her, with much slime and viscous filth:
in a months time, there was saved of pure red Gravel above half a pint: for a
while no longer than she took the powers of Juniper Berries, could she have any
ease; but by the constant use of the same in about six weeks time, the Lady was
in hopes to be restored to her desired health: I must confess beyond all my
inward presages and expectations, considering into what a low state of body she
was brought, who was at my undertaking of her, little more than skin and bone,
so much had her distemper emaciated and weakened her.

12. Outwardly, I caused her Temples, Nostrills, Pulses of her Wrists, and
Stomach to be bathed with the following composition; as also the whole region
of the Abdomen from the sternon to the share: Take powers of Oranges and
Limons, of each an ounce: powers of Rosemary and sassafras, of each half an
ounce: powers of Caraways, and Amber, of each two drams: mix them together:
with this mixture the parts above named were bathed twice a day, viz. morning
and evening, for about twenty days together. By the use of all these things, as
above prescribed, the young Lady was perfectly restored to her pristin Health
in about eight weeks time, to the joy and satisfaction both of her self, and
her afflicted Relations.

VI. Convulsion fits in another young Gentlewoman, arising from Pains of the
stone or Gravel, etc.

1. This person after many weeks lingering sickness fell into my hand, she was
much wasted, and reduced into a very low condition, so that life was dispaired
of: Her fits were plainly Convulsive accompanied with a continual Vomiting,
loss of appetite, loathing, sickness at Stomach, paleness of countenance, and
trembling over her whole body: her pulses were feeble, her urine and dejection
black like soot, and whatsoever she eat for many days met with such a stoppage
in her Stomach, that it past not through her; moreover the stoppage of urine,
and extreme pain in making of water was almost perpetual.

2. It was suspected to be the stone, upon which she was searched first by a
Scotch man, secondly by an eminent Chyrurgian of this town; but no stone of any
bigness could be found or perceived, except some small ones about the bigness
of large Pease, or the like: however, the Chyrurgian and other eminent
Physicians who were then sent for, concluded it to be a Cancer of the Womb.

3. I being present began to admire, at that judgment, for as much as the Lady
had never any distemper of the Womb, and being an unmarried Gentlewoman, as she
had never any eminent stoppage of her Courses, so was she not troubled with any
other distemper of the Womb, to occas^on such a suspicion: moreover among all
the symptoms that were present, not any one symptom of a Cancer appeared: there
was neither inflammation, tumor, nor obstruction of the Womb, nor any wound,
Ulcer, hardness or Pain of the Womb; all the pains which she sustained arose
purely from the obstruction of the urine, by slime, gravel, sand, and small
stones, etc. and where as in Cancers there is always a perpetual pain in them,
the contrary was evident in this Lady, for she has been sometimes not only hours
and days in absolute ease, but weeks also, which very thing alone declared the
absence of a Cancer.

4. Notwithstanding all these arguments, and many more, which I then used, so
magisterial were the Gentlemen in their opinion, that there was no removing
them from it; from whence it was concluded the sick was uncurable, and
therefore must be content to submit to her fate: which heavy and disconsolate
judgment did in my opinion more hurt to the Patient than her Disease, for such
a flood of tears, and so much grief seized upon her for five or six days, that
we thought by that alone she would be carried off; no arguments nor persuasion
which I could use to the contrary could prevail with her, to satisfy her.

5. At length she submitted to my Arguments, and committed her self to my Care:
and by reason of that great oppression at Stomach, I gave her a gentle Vomit,
to wit, sal Vitrioli, a dram: dissolved in a little Chicken broth: it gave her
about six Vomits, and some slight motions downwards: the next day it was
repeated again, and it gave her about the like number of Vomits, bringing up a
very great quantity of thick, tough, viscous phlegm, which cooled and chil'd the
Ventricle, hindered digestion, caused Vomitings, and obstructed all the adjacent
passages.

6. This Vomit was repeated five or six times, so long till she ceased vomiting
up such a bird-lime-like phlegm; and truly in my opinion the quantity of that
kind of Phlegm, which was brought out of her Ventricle much exceeded what we
have mentioned in the former observation; so that I cannot but wonder in my own
breast, how the Ventricle of any Creature could be loaded with such a quantity
of praeternatural matter and live: however this was observable that upon the
second Vomit, all the Convulsion fits ceased, although the fits before returned
sometimes more than ten or twelve times in the space of twenty four hours: this
gave encouragment to me to prosecute the cure: and now this heavy matter being
removed from the Stomach, she began to desire food, to eat it, to digest it,
and to gather strength thereupon.

7. However to comfort and strengthen the Ventricle, thus debilitated with that
abundance of cold matter, I ordered her now and than to take powers of Cloves
in Sack: sometimes this following mixture: Take spirit of Angelica, the greater
composition, four ounces: Oil of Cinnamon, half a dram: mix them: dose half a
spoonful at a time in choice Canary: also for change of liquors, and for a
farther gratification of the Stomach, I ordered the sick to drink her fill of
Wormwood wine, which she also longed for.

8. Now I began to think of taking away the pain in making water, and the
obstruction of the Urine; (both which were mightily abated by the preceding
Vomits) for which purpose, I first gave her this: Take pure spirit of
Turpentine, one dram: juice of Limons, two spoonfuls: mix them for two doses:
which she took: this done, I gave her the infusion of large Onions in Rhenish
wine, which was drunk for some days: after that the infusion of winter Cheries,
in Rhenish Wine, which she drank also for five or six days, or more.

9. But the things which completed and perfected the Cure, was this
composition following: Take powers of Juniper Berries, four ounces: Ens
Veneris, half an ounce: water of Hydropiper enough to dissolve the salt: mix
them well together by shaking: of this she constantly took a quarter of a
spoonful in a glass of Wine, morning, noon, and night, and sometimes oftener, for
about fourteen days together, in which time she confessed her self to be
perfectly restored to her former health. But one thing is to be noted, that
through the whole course of this Cure, in any kind of extremity, especially if
it was Vehement, we had recourse to Opiates, among which my Guttae Vitae were
chief, and which she took from twenty five drops to forty, as the vehemence or
necessity required: and several nights she took them, about two or three hours
after the taking of the Compositum of powers of Juniper Berries, purely out of
fear, and for rest sake.

10. While she took this last Juniperine Medicament, she was observed
constantly to avoid a great quantity of slime, viscous filth, and sand or
gravel: the gravel was in quantity near a pint, with which she voided some
little stones, about the bigness of small pease, which in a little time after
crumbled into sand also: However after her amendment, she continued the use of
the same Medicine for five or six weeks longer, by the use of which she became
so absolutely freed from her Disease of the stone that to this day (and it is
now about three years since) she has not had the least symptom of its return.

VII. Convulsion fits in the same Lady arising from an Hypochondriack
Melancholy, and extreme Rigor.

1. The same Lady (last discoursed of) about three years after the former
illness, was seized upon by degrees with Hypochondriack melancholy, this
getting the upper hand of her, brought also with it a very great Rigor; which
by continuation, introduced Convulsion fits: The coldness was not only extreme,
but also continued long, sometimes for six, eight or ten, yea sometimes twelve
hours: in so much that the sick Gentlewoman fell into them with such a dread,
as to believe an Impossibility of her ever coming out of them again.

2. She being in the Country; her Friends sent to me a relation of her
condition; upon which I ordered her to take the Powers of Cloves, in Canary:
and by reason she complained of an exceeding pain and weakness at Stomach, with
loss of Appetite; I further prescribed a Magistery of sulphur, with this
following powder: Take Terra sigillata, one ounce: Crabs claws, red Coral,
Oriental pearls, all levigated, of each half a dram: Elks hoofs, Man's skull
philosophically calci^ed, of each half an ounce: mix them, dose half a dram:
morning and night. These things did her good as to her Stomach, and took away
the pain and Vomiting, but the Rigor coming by fits remained.

3. For her Convulsions, and also to take a way the Rigor; I ordered the
Potestates Convulsivae to be taken 30 or 40 drops at a time in Sack three or
four times a day, or oftener. The said Potestates are thus made: Take the powers
of Rosemary, of Lavender, of each one dram: powers of Sage, and of Pennyroyall,
of each two drams: spirit of Man's skull, of Elks hoofs, of each three drams:
Powers of Amber, half an ounce: mix them.

4. Externally, I ordered her Head and Stomach, as also the spina dorsi, to be
bathed with the Potestates Nervosae twice a day, viz. morning and night. The
said Potestates are thus made: Take Powers of Angelica, and of sage, of each
two drams: powers of savin and of Juniper Berries, of each three drams: powers
of Limons and Oranges, spirit of saffron, of each half an ounce: mix them: and
bath the places aforespecified therewith.

5. For a farther Corroboration of her Stomach, I ordered the Elixir
proprietatis, to be taken some drops at a time, now and than for change of
Medicines sake: all these things had the good effect upon her stomach; but as
to the Rigor, and Convulsive affection they did apparently got ground upon her,
in so much that a Coach was ordered for me, and I was forthwith hasted into the
Country.

6. When I came there I beheld the deplorable object, in all outward appearance
without hope of recovery: when the Rigor fell upon her, it continued so long,
that she always dispaired of coming out of it any more: neither the warming
stone, bottles of hot water applied to her Sides and Feet, nor hot cloths laid
continually upon her Head, Stomach, Bowels, Thighs and Legs, could procure any
heat in her, but oftentimes the Cold would last for ten or twelve hours; and if
at any time it lasted but five six or seven hours, it would then return twice
in twenty four hours space: and in the time of the Rigor it was that these
Convulsive fits (so numerous) invaded her.

7. Finding all that I had don ineffectual, I was at first at a stand what to
do: but considering that it was an universal cold disafection of the Nerves
which so extremely afflicted her, and that it was caused from a stupendous
Hipochondriack Melancholy joined with taking some external Cold; I plainly saw,
that though inward things might be good, yet that with them we should not soon
enough reach the conjoined cause, so as to dissolve it, before possibly it
might overturn or destroy the Patient. For this cause sake I forbid her the
taking of any cold thing inwardly; and in all her drink to drink Powers of
Cloves, or some drops of the Potestates Nervosae or Convulsivae; and withal
ordered her to take either alone or in Sack, three four or six times a day
spirit of Saffron, which last thing she found to do her most good in respect to
her Hipochondriack affection.

8. But seeing we wanted the thing which was most essential in order to this
Cure, by reason of the extremity of the Patient, the next morning early, I
hastened home, and sent down about threescore and ten ounces of the Powers of
Amber, ordering the Head, or Temples and Forehead with the Nostrills, as also
the Stomach, sides, hypochonders, spina dorsi, Thighs, Legs, Feets, and Arms,
to be twice a day well bathed with the same, till such time as they either
found help, or that the whole quantity was used. It is a neat Medicine: for it
neither greases as Oil, nor continues wet, as water, but momentarily drinks
into the flesh, so that it could not be nauseous to the most queasy Stomach: By
the time that the whole quantity was spent, the Patient (thanks be to God for
so great a mercy) became perfectly well, to the great satisfaction of her
afflicted Relations.

9. It is wonderful how suddenly and how admirably the External use of the
powers of Amber, did not only dissolve that extreme Rigor, but also perfectly
remove the Convulsive fits, performing outwardly what no actual external heat
could do; for hereby momentarily the whole nervous systeme was throwly heated,
and the cause of the Convulsion dissolved, which by a Cart load of Internal
medicaments could never have been so exquisitely, and so suddenly performed;
moreover the Nerves themselves were mightily corroborated and strengthened.

10. But during all the time that this was a doing outwardly, inward Medicines
were not wanting to be used; for I sent down also with the said powers of
Amber, the spirit of Saffron (which she much desired, and confessed she found
much good in) the powers of Cloves, and the Potestates Convulsivae and
Nervosae, which I ordered her to take, either as her Stomach liked, or
alternatim, in Sack, as aforementioned: these things she failed not to perform;
and in one months time became perfectly well, beyond mine, or her Friends
expectations.

11. But whereas she was troubled with an extreme watching; so that for some
times she could not sleep for two or three days and nights together, I ordered
her now and then to take (in the evening) twenty five, thirty, or forty drops
of my Guttae Vitae in Sack, and so repose upon it; which she did several times,
and in a short time removed that troublesome symptom: moreover after that she
became well, I ordered her to continue for some time the use of the former
internal nervous Medicaments, and matutine reception of the Elixir proprietatis.

VIII. Convulsion fits in a Child, proceeding from Worms.

1. The exquisitness of the cure, and the speedy performance thereof, makes me
to insert this example. A little Boy of four or five years old was of a sudden
seized with Convulsion fits, and that without any praevious cause that his
Relations, or bystanders could apprehend: these fits had afflicted the Child
for about two months, coming sometimes once in two days, and sometimes once a
day, and sometimes twice a day.

2. A stranger accidentally seeing the Child, advised its Parents to give it of
my Family Pills, two at a time every Morning fasting, or every other morning,
according as they found them to work, and to continue the use thereof for a
week or longer: they did so; the Pills purged the Child without any Pain, and
in about ten or twelve days time brought away about fourteen long worms; a span
or more in length, after which the Convulsions ceased of their own accord, and
the Child presently mended, and grew exceeding well upon it.

3. This thing was don some years since: but of late, Mr Hollier, told me he
gave them to a young Girl, who had not been well, and the cause of whose
Disease seemed to be very abstruse: one or two doses, at most, brought a way
from her several hundreds of Worms, after which she persently mended, and grew
very well.

IX. Convulsion fits attended with a Lethargy, which were Mortal.

1. A young Maiden about seventeen years of Age, was seized with Convulsion
fits (as it was thought by taking cold in the Snow) being put to Bed; some of
the Neighborhood advised her Parents to make her drunk with Brandy, in hopes
of a Cure: it was don, and the Maid drunk about three quarters of a pint, or
better of that liquor, whereupon being overcome with it, she became very sick,
and afterward went to sleep: the next day, the Creature awaked not; about
noon, they disturbed her; but she desired still to sleep.

2 Hereupon I was sent for, because they feared their Child would dye: when I
came to her, another Convulsive fit seized her again; which after a while went
off; but the sick remained sleepy: after this manner she continued for a week;
or more.

3. Considering her condition, I presumed it to be a Lethargy which accompanied
the Convulsion; they desired my help; but truly, I plainly told them, I knew
not well what to do: however outwardly I advised to bath all the External
parts, Head, Temples, Vertebrae of the Neck and Backbone, as also the parts
afflicted with the Convulsion, with Powers of Rosemary, which was don, but no
amendment succeeded; this was don for about eight days, but the Lethargy still
increased: as for internal Medicaments we could get nothing down her Throat; It
was once attempted, but she was in danger of Choking, so that for the future,
we totally desisted to offer any thing of that kind.

4. Upon the fourteenth day after her first seizure, she was taken with her
last fit, upon which, (by reason of the Extremity thereof) she expired: after
she was dead, above half a pint of matter, not much unlike thick Milk, came (as
I suppose) out of her Head by her Nostrills, which smelt as strong of Brandy,
as if it had been Brandy it self: which gave me a satisfaction, that the Brain
was hurt therewith, and the Animal spirits being confounded were overcome,
whence proceeded her Lethargy, drousiness, stagnation of the natural juyces,
and obstruction, or rather a suffocation of the Vital flame.

XX. Convulsion fits arising from Excessive pains of the Gout, in both Feet and
Ankles.

1. A Woman about forty years of Age having been for about three or four years
past troubled with the Gout, was at last so exceedingly afflicted therewith,
that she became bedrid: This pain, by reason of an accidental taking of Cold,
(it happening in the middle of Winter) was increased, and raged to that
extremity, that the sick fell into Convulsion fits, which vehemently afflicted
her.

2. I was forthwith called to her assistance, where her Husband related to me,
the whole progress of her Disease, which was very strange, and admirable: a
Physician and Chyrurgian, which had been before me, had taken away from her at
four several times, and all in the space of eight days, above forescore ounces
of Blood, hoping therefrom for amendment and Cure, but the sick instead of
growing better upon it grew worse and worse every day, and at length became as
is before related Convulsive.

3. Moreover, she was afflicted with an obstruction of her Courses, which by no
artifice they could provoke; so that the condition of the Gentlewoman seemed to
be desperate: upon this, I caused the parts afflicted to be well bathed with my
Guttae vitae, and then applied over the same, my Emplastrum Arthriticum,
inwardly I gave this Bolus: Take Venice Turpentine, a dram: Venice Treacle,
half a dram: Extract of Thebain Opium, two grains: Oil of Vitriol, ten drops:
mix altogether for a dose: this she swallowed, and drank after it a little
Glass of Rhenish wine, and sugar: This was again repeated at night, and given
twice a day for four days; by which the sick had wonderful ease; and the
Convulsion fits much abated: moreover her Terms, which had been obstructed for
more than fourteen months were provoked, and came down very well.

4. A little respite from the Paroxysm being obtained, I gently purged her with
my Family Pills, the which she took once a week for six or eight weeks
together, by the use of which, she confessed her Body to be exceeding well
cleansed; and they procured to her also an exceeding good Stomach, so that she
eat her food very well, which she had not don for many months before: but every
night going to bed (except the purging days) she took a dose of my Laudanum, by
which she said she, perceived more comfort, than by all the other Medicaments
she had taken thorough her whole life.

5. But by reason of her exceeding weakness (through loosing so much Blood)
together with illness and faintness, which often attended her in the day time;
I ordered her to take every day, in the morning fasting, an hour before Dinner,
and as long before Supper, a little Electuarium ad Tabidos upon a knives point,
and if she so pleased, to take after it a small taster of choice Cinnamon
water; this she did, and by the assiduous use thereof she was restored out of
her weakness, even to admiration.

6. One thing more observable in this Cure is, that whereas this Gentlewoman
never had a Child in all her life; nor that she knew of, had ever conceaved
with Child, but esteemed her self barren; she, (suddenly after her body had
been well cleansed with the Family Pills,) conceived, and brought forth in due
time a delicate and lusty Boy: and after him, had several other brave and lusty
Children: this I look upon to be caused from the power and force of the said
Family Pills, which not only effectually cleanse the Womb, and parts adjacent,
but also powerfully remove all obstructions, and open all the Vessels thereof,
even in their most inward recesses.

II. Convulsion fits in a middle aged Woman, arising from obstruction of the
Mesentery with a stony hardness.

1. This wretched and mi^^^able creature having been for a long time extremely
afflicted with an inward pain of the Bowels, was by continuance, length of
time, and vehemence of the Pain seized with Convulsion fits. When this Pain
first afflicted her, it was after the manner of the Cholick, and came upon her
by fits, as the Cholick is wont to do. But in the process of time the Pain
seemed to be perpetual.

2. All things were don that could be imagined to give her ease, but nothing
prevailed; and although at first, Carminatives and such things as expelled
wind, did her much good; yet as her Disease grew more and more upon her, the
Pain became the more extreme, and all Medicines which she took seemed rather to
increase it: so that at length by the Vehemence thereof she was taken with
Convulsion f^^s.

3. In this extremity I was sent for, and having examined into the state of her
Disease, I much dispaired of her Cure: and so much the more, 1. because her
Pain was perpetual, which made me fear some permanent matter. 2. because that
although it was concluded by all to be the Cholick, yet nothing which was
proper for the Cholick did her any good. 3. If any thing of an Opiate was given
her, it rather added to her misery. 4. she eat but very little, and what she did
eat came away in a Chylous flux. 5. she was consumed even to skin and bone.

4. Upon these considerations, I concluded her Disease to be desperate: and by
reason of the Chylous flux which had long afflicted her, I concluded the
greatness of he affliction to be in the Mesentery, and that the Convulsion fits
were caused by consent through a hurt of the Nerves of the Par Vagum: and
thereupon I declined the giving her any Physic; but she had formerly taken
many Medicines, so that scarcely any thing could have been thought of, which
had been wanting to her; yet nothing that she took did her any good.

5. In this lingering condition she continued for a season, but at length in
the strength of a Convulsion fit dyed: after she was dead, some of the
Physicians which had been before concerned in her cure, desired to have her
opened; the which was ^^n in my presence; all things were found well in her,
from Head to Foot, excepting the Mesentery, which was changed into a stoney
hardness, with many little stones in it, in several parts thereof; and the
Chylous receptacles themselves were filled with these stones, which were of
strange and unusual shapes, not round, but cornered and sharp, after a most
admirable manner: and some of them shot out into length like Crystalls.

6. I enquired of her Husband, what he thought was the prime or first cause of
all her illness, and he told me, he believed it to be from her drinking Epsom
waters; for before she went thither she was well enough, and ailed nothing: but
going thither and drinking those waters plentifully, she by degrees, found a
Pain in her Bowels to come upon her, which never after perfectly left her, and
to her dying day she was of the belief, that the drinking of those waters was
the sole cause of her Disease, and Death; the which I also am inclinable to
think, for as much as I have known them to be the ruin, of a great many more
besides.

XII. Conv^lsion fits in a young Child about six weeks old.

1. This Child through the intolerable griping of the Bowels fell into
Convulsion fits, the which were so vehement upon it; that upon every Paroxysm,
they feared the Child would never come out of them: in the absence of these
fits, it would almost continually cry, in so much that I concluded, it must be
wind, or a sharp humor, or both, that afflicted it, and was the cause of its
crying, and also of the Convulsion fits.

2. Upon this, I ordered the powers of Caraways, six or eight drops to be given
to the Child in Sack; and morning and evening, five or six drops of my Gutta
vitae to be given in wine also: these things gave the Child immediate ease:
also, outwardly I caused all the Belly of the Child, as also the Stomach
thereof to be anointed with Oil of Mace by expression; and over the same a
plaster of Mithridate to be applied.

3. These things had their desired effects, for the Child had presently ease,
and never but one fit of the Convulsion after, and that much more gentle than
the former: however after that we had overcome the fits, and the Child seemed
to be restored, I caused it to be purged very well with Manna, correcting it
with the Powers of Caraways: this brought away a great quantity of black and
Green slimy filth from the Child, and purged it pleasantly without any Pain; so
that its diseases vanished, and never returned any more.

XIII. The History of a Gentleman that was Seized with the Cramp after a very
strange manner.

1. This Gentleman, by reason of taking cold in his Feet, was seized with the
Cramp in both his Legs, so that when the fit came, the Calves would be both
shrunk up, and be like hard knots, almost as big as ones fist, which made him
rore and cry out with vehemence, like a mad or distracted man; the extremity
thereof in less than half an hour, would be gone; but the Convulsion of the
parts being very strong, left a great soreness behind it, and so weakn'd him,
that he could not set his Feet upon the ground to go; and if he strove to bear
his Body upon them; it was with exceeding great Pain.

2. This Disease continuing, the Convulsion by degrees seized upon other parts,
and in like manner afflicted his Hands and Arms, so that he could scarcely stir
himself: and upon almost the least motion, or turning himself, one part or
another would be crampt or shrunk up, with a horrible Pain or tortor of the
part: upon the sudden opening of his Mouth, it would seize him under his Chin,
so that he trembled to think of yawning; and indeed upon any sudden motion, or
the feeling of the least cold the spasm would take him, sometimes in one part,
sometimes in two parts, sometimes in more, and sometimes it would be universal
over his whole Body.

3. In the first place I caused the Patient to be put into a warm Sulphur-bath,
because it has great power not only to open obstructions, but also to dilate
the Pores, whereby the Cold and Windy vapors or flatulent Spirit, engendered in
the Muscles, Nerves, and Tendons, might be in some measure drawn out: this don,
I applied, to the principal parts afflicted with the Cramp, this following
Cataplasm: Take fresh roots of Bryony, of Marshmallows, of Mallows, of each
one handful: boil them in Milk till they are soft; then beat them into a mash,
and add to them the mucilage of seeds of Fleawort, and Quinces, Line-seed, of
each two ounces: Goose, and Dogs grease, of each one ounce: Oil of Bays, an
ounce and half: Oils of Amber, and of Anniseeds, of each half an ounce:
Saffron, two drams: powder of Bayberries, enough to make it of a Convenient
stifness: mix all well together: spread it upon Leather, and apply it.

4. This went not without its desired effect, for the Patient found much ease
and Comfort by it: but being removed, and exposing himself to the Air, or not
being so careful, as he ought to be of taking cold, the Tetanos returned again,
and that with a greater Vehemence: whereupon, I advised the Application of the
same Cataplasm again; but first I caused all the Convulsed parts, for two days
to be well anointed, Morning and Evening, with this following: Take
Frankincense, Mastich, of each one ounce: Storax, Benjamin, Myrrh, Opopanax,
Bdellium, Elemi, Sagapenum, Amoniacum sarcocol, of each half an ounce:
Euphorbiam, Aloes, Labdanum, Castoreum, roots of Galangal, Costus, Nutmegs,
Mace, of each six drams: sage, Marjoram, Ground Pine, Rosemary and Lavender
flowers, of each ten drams: Venice Turpentine, a pound: distill all in a Copper
Vesica, or in a retort, according to Art, so will you have a water and Oil:
which keep apart: with the water I caused him to be well bathed; and then after
that, I caused him to be anointed with the Oil: and after two days as
aforesaid, applied again the former Cataplasm.

5. Upon the removing of the Cataplasm, to avoid his immediate taking of Cold,
as also to strengthen the parts weakened by the Vehemence of the Convulsion, I
applied this following Emplaster: Take Oil of sweet Almonds new drawn, Oil of
Camomil, Oil of earthworms, Oil of Whelps, Oil of Castoreum, Oil of Line seed
by Expression, Oil of Nutmegs by expression, Oil of Hypericon, of each one
ounce: Mucilage, of Fleawort-seed, and Linseed, Ducks-grease, Calves marrow,
Turpentine, Frankincense, Myrrh, of each half an ounce: flowers of sulphur, six
drams: powder of Earthworms, two drams: Saffron, a dram and half: Wax a
sufficient quantity, make all into a Cerate, which spread upon Leather, or new
Cloths, and apply it.

6. This Emplaster was kept upon the part for a week, and renewed every week
for a month or more: at what time I advised him to leave it off, but withal to
bath the parts twice a day, with some warming and comfortable water; and so I
doubted not, but he might be secure for the future of his Health, as in
relation to this disease: Take roots of Orrice, Horseradish, Angelica, Acorus,
both Galangals, Costus, Pellitory of spain, Zedory, Gingen, Cyperus, leaves of
sage, Time, Rosemary, Rue, Marjoram, Bawm, Hyssop, savory, Lavender, flowers of
staechas, flowers of Hypericon, Cowslips, Mustard seeds, Gith, Juniper and
Bay Berries, Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace, Cubebs, spicknard, long and round Pepper,
Xyloaloes, yellow sanders, saffron, Frankincense, Myrrh, Liquid storax,
Castoreum, of each one ounce: sal niter, eight ounces: all being prepared and
poudred grossly, affuse upon them spirit of Wine, five pints: digest in a warm
place for a week, then draw off the spirit in Balneo Mariae, or sand according
to Art. with this water he bathed his Limbs and other parts affected Morning
and Evening, and became well.

7. But that we might the more secure his Health to him, and take away the
progenerative Cause of that flatulent spirit producing the Tetanos, I advised
him to purge two or three times with my Family Pills with Aloes: and withal
every Morning and Night going to bed to take about a spoonful of this following
mixture, by the use of which thing he found an incomparable kindness: Take of
the best Cinnamon water, a pint: Cardamom water, Aquae Coelestis, Aquae
Mirabilis, Aquae Jmperialis, of each half a pint: spirit of saffron, Doctor
Stephens his water, of each four ounces: syrup of Roses solutive, syrup of
Clove-gily-flowers, of each a pound and half: mix them well together, and keep
them in a glass bottle close stopped for use; to be taken Morning and Evening, as
aforesaid.

XXIV. Convulsion fits in a young Man, arising from a hurt of the Genus
Nervosum, occasioned by a Blow.

1. How many ways Convulsions may be caused is not my place hear to lay down:
yet by reason of this present observation, We shall a little search into some
of the principal causes, that thereby we may make our discourse something the
more intelligible to the Apprehension of the industrious Student. The more
frequent cause of Convulsions is thought to be an irritation of the Brain,
pouring forth the Spirits into the Nerves: such a one by which its expulsive,
faculty stired up, rising to cast off what is troublesome to it, does together
drive forth the Spirits; as Nature every where feeling Pain and trouble, is
wont to thrust Spirits thither, and together with them Blood also, sometimes so
powerfully, that there follows an Inflammation of that part which receives them.

2. But this irritation, or trouble of the Brain, is thought by some Physicians
to happen rather by consent or compassion with some parts, than from its proper
affect; because we see Convulsions happen rather from an affect and disease of
another part, far distant sometimes from the Brain, than of the Brain it self;
as from a Nerve pricked, a Tendon hurt, or some violent Medicine taken inwardly.

3. Whereas, if it did happen from some grievious disease of the Brain (as
indeed it must needs be a grievious Disease, which must induce so vehement a
symptom) the accidents of Convulsions would not so soon remit: as also in other
hurts of this principal part, we see there succeeds long continued and lasting
symptoms, as you see in an Apoplexy. Now those affects which happen to the
Nerves, which cause Convulsions, as a Puncture, Inflammation, etc. if they were
in the Brain, would not cause them, but an Apoplexy and Frenzy: although the
Brain thus affected by consent also, if the cause offending be great, and
follows continually, not only irritating the Brain it self; but also by its
Vehemence and frequency so hurting it, contracts also its proper Disease; then
the contention of Convulsions lasts almost continually (as I not long since
observed in a noble Lady,) nor does the sick hardly ever come any more to
themselves, or the fit wholly cease, till the Patient is dead.

4. Yet it may be also, that from the same cause, (as we shall anon speak, when
we treat of that which is poisonous) both the Genus Nervosum, and Brain being
hurt together, Convulsions may happen, coupled together with other hurts of the
mind.

5. But to find out, the part which is first affected, and with which the Brain
consents, we must consider the symptoms, to wit, the inordinate motion, and
privation of Senses, which has so great consent with the Muscles exercising
voluntary motion, and with the Brain communicating sense; that that being hurt,
the Muscles are forced, and the Brain cease a while from its function, which
we say, is that Genus nervosum, Or Nervous System, because it begins in the
Brain, and ends in the Muscles: under which name ( viz. of Genus Nervosum) we
understand all the Nerves in the whole Body, both within and without the skull,
especially those endued with the sense of feeling, and the nervous parts which
are compounded of them, which are of most exquisite sense: the which being so
hurt, that the functions of the Brain are abolished by sympathy, and those of
the Muscles augmented, it must needs be, that Convulsions follow, which how it
may come to pass we will now immediately explicate.

6. The offense of the Genus Nervosum, not that which weakens its functions,
but that which by bringing trouble to it, does rather stir up its faculty, if
it be caused either in one place or more, a Nerve or nervous part is affected:
and if the hurt be great: then the whole Genus Nervosum (or Nervous system,)
rising up, whilst it endeavors to shake off that with which it is offended,
does together exagitate the Brain, from whence it proceeds, and draws it into
consent; so that, that also feeling these disturbances of the Nerves, whilst it
endeavors to help them, to resist and overcome the disaffection, driving the
Animal spirits from it self, into the beginning of the Nerves, it is for a
season left destitute of its functions: but no otherwise, than we sometimes
observe in a syncope, that the Heart without any proper affect of its own, the
Spirits wandering for some other cause, does cease from its function, till they
return again.

7. In which effusion of the Spirits into the Nerves, it happens that the
motive power does continue in them, not only as was declared formerly, but also
by reason of the plenty of Spirits of the Nerves, the Muscles are excited to
exercise their motion; but chiefly that Violent and inordinate motion, in the
beginning of Epileptical fits is acted for this cause, that whilst the Genus
Nervosum does endeavor to expel this hurt or disaffection, it is contracted
into it self, and then again dilated, forcing the Muscles of the whole Body,
into whose beginnings the Nerves are inserted, by consecution to commit those
inordinate and outrageous motions, by pulling or drawing, and then remitting
them; and that so long till the offending matter is removed or expelled from
them; or by reason of dejection of strength, and as it were weariness, when
they can no longer exercise Motion, yet notwithstanding they retain their Limbs
convulsed or attracted, stiff and fixed for a while, till at last they come
wholly to themselves.

8. This often happens in a Catalepsis, presently at the beginning, no
agitation of the Body going before: perhaps because in that Disease; there is
not so great an effusion of Spirits into the Nerves, when as in that sometimes
some senses do yet remain, and there is a less iritation of the Nerves, whence
as it may be accounted (as Platerus says) a certain lighter kind of Epilepsie,
yet very seldom happening, otherwise proceeding from the same cause, which
breeds an Epilepsie, but which does either l^s^ ^ffect the Genus Nervosum by
irritation, or else has that property, to produce a stupidity or rigidness of
the members, rather than a Convulsion.

9. But that these causes of hurt to the Genus Nervosum, from whence an
Epilepsy often proceeds, a Catalepsis more seldom, are diverse and frequent, it
is no wonder; for that the Nerves by reason of their exquisite sense, are not
only unable to endure great hurts or Pains, but also are so easily offended by
the slightest, that they cannot suffer the touch of a body (for which reason,
whilst they are carried in the Body, nature has provided for them, that they
touch not the Bones, neither are they joined to any other parts, (besides those
into which they are inserted) from which notwithstanding they are not
exasperated by diverse incursions; unless they be great and violent, so that
they be Convulsed; of which sort are those which may happen to them from a
Wound, irritation, or infection, either acting singly, or more of them together.

10 That a Convulsion may be caused by a Wound made in a Nerve or Nervous part,
daily experience has confirmed; yet not from every Wound of a Nerve, but only,
or for the most part, from a Nerve hurt by Pricking, upon which Convulsions are
wont to follow; its function being thereby stirred up, by reason of the hurt:
for which reason also, if we cut off a Nerve Convulsed, we cure the Convulsion
caused in it: but this molestation of the Nerve, proceeding from the solution
of its continuity, is yet more increased by an Inflammation or Putrefaction,
from the Corruption restrained in the narrow hole of the Puncture of the said
Nerve, and by the great Pain from thence which for the most part does attend
this affection if the Wound happen from Iron, which of its own nature is an
enemy to the Nerves, commonly by reason of its rust, or because it is infected,
or a blow or bite of a poisonous Beast.

11. But also a Nervous part being wounded, especially in that place where the
Nerves go under it, and constitute the greater part of it; as the Bladder
being hurt at the Neck; the Muscles about their beginnings, either by chance,
or whilst the Chyrurgian and Lithotomist attempt an aperture of the place, most
commonly dangerous Convulsions succeed, which a difficulty of swallowing going
before (so much feared by the Chyrurgian, calling it a Spasm of the Stomach) is
wont most an end to foretell.

12. An irritation of the Genus Nervosum, if it be vehement, may also cause
Convulsions; which proceeds either from some great Cause, which because it
torments the Nerves with grievious Pain, makes Convulsions by accident; or the
which stimulating the Nerves by it self, by a manifest Quality, and causing
Pain, or none, together with it, does convell them: which cause proceeds either
from Medicines, or internal humors, as Blood, Choler, Phlegm, molesting the
Nerves by their proper substance, or by a Vapor only.

13. But Convulsions are caused chiefly, by reason of Pain, either, by reason
of the greatness, and long continuance of the Torment, as in Cholicks, from
whence often arises Convulsions; or if they vex and molest Bodies endued with
most exquite sense, and which by reason of their tenderness do uneasily and
difficultly endure such Pains: on which acount also Infants, not only in diverse
kinds of sickness, but when they begin to breed Teeth, being exasperated with
Pain, are oftentimes taken with Convulsions: and also immoderate Tickling made
in the like tender Bodies, because that also gives trouble and a sad sense,
experience does testify has caused Convulsions in many: and by this Artifice a
certain Man murdered five or six Wives one after another, and being dead
pretended they died in Convulsions, which was true; the Convulsion being
excited by an immoderate Tickling, which the Devil prompted him to, for the
love of Money sake, he getting a new portion with every wife: at length it was
discovered, and the man was hanged, for the exercising of his Art. And it is
confessed by all, that even a light Tickling, caused by Worms, creeping up and
down the Guts, and Stomach, and sucking them with their Mouths, does move in
Infants not only horrors, and scratcing of the Nose, but also light Epileptical
Convulsions.

14. Medicines taken, which stimulate the Expulsive faculty of the Stomach and
Guts; if they excite those parts too much, as they excite a Convulsive motion,
which is by Hiccoughing; so, if they be very sharp, biting, and burning, as
those things put up into the Nose, they excite sneezing. And so a purging
faculty, especially joined to them, by which they solicit Nature at once, very
much, both by Vomit and stool produce Convulsions; such as happens by Hellebor,
Euphorbium, Aron-roots, flowers of Antimony and other like things; and those
deadly too, if by too much insinuating of themselves into the parts they cease
not to exagitate them: but not yet deadly, if when they first begin to solicit
Nature, being repulsed by her, they be cast forth upwards and downwards, as I
have observed from the use of Vitrum Antimonij, and Asarabacca, some feeling
only forerunings of a Spasm in their Thighs, but others also Convulsive, to
have returned again to themselves.

15. Corrupt and putrefying Blood, if it be carried into the Genus Nervosum, or
Nervous system, by its disaffection may cause Convulsions; as it sometimes
happens from a blow of the Head, penetrating the Skull, yet not dividing the
substance of the Brain, (whence rather an Apoplexy would follow) but only
wounding the Membrains of the Brain, with a Malign quality, by consent of
which, and also that sinking, and possessing the beginning of the Nerves,
produced from the Basis of the Brain, it breeds Convulsions, which follow
Wounds of the Head: which sort of Convulsions also in Apostems, are sometimes
wont to follow a Frenzy which went before.

16. Choler of all the humors is commonly the principal, as well the Yollow as
the Green and the Black which by its Acrimony is wont to stimulate and irritate
the Nerves and Nervose parts; the which also by its thinness, it the more
easily enters: which in Cholick Pains, does cause those Convulsions; not only
because it breeds those excruciating pains; but also, because, insinuating it
self into the Stomach and Guts, it does too much provoke them with a kind of
Caustic virtue or force, which Convulsions last as long as this acid humor
ceases not to irritate; so that there is no need to fancy any other reason,
that it is far-fetcht to the Nerves, if it ought to cause Covulsions: Also if a
Covulsion proceeds from Anger, they think it may happen, by reason of the
boiling and effusion of Choler; although that rather proceeds from too great a
motion of the mind stiring up the Spirits.

17. From thin, salt and acrid Phlegm, also, falling down from the Brain, into
the spaces through which the Nerves are carried, and pulling of them, an
Epilepsie or Convulsions may be excited. As in a Palsy sometimes moistning the
Nerves, it first causes Resolutions; afterward by its Arimony, which it
either had before, or by putrefaction has newly acquired, provoking the Nerves,
it sometimes excites those Convulsions, which sometimes follow after a Palsy;
which sneezing, arising from the same acrid humor, distilling also from the
Brain into the Nose, is wont to go before and Presage; whence some think, the
custom of praying [God save you] after sneezing, took its first rise; for that
it had been observed that sneezing was sometimes a forerunner of an Epilepsy,
or Convulsion.

18. Filthy and acrid Vapors, also if some malignity be joined, being raised
in the body, and especially plucking and twitching the beginning of the Nerves;
or else where, provoking and irritating especially the greater, do beget
Convulsions, which they say, are caused by consent, or Compassion (as we may
better speak in Our Dialect) such as are from Vicious, corrupt, and Putrid
meats, humors, Excrements, Worms, collected in the Stomach, Guts, Womb, Veins,
in diverse diseases and disaffections of those parts, or of the whole Body, as
those raised from Fevers, all which do produce Convulsions, and which are
usual to follow those diseases.

19. But such things which excite Convulsions from a Malign and Poisonous
Quality, are various: which according to the Diverse nature of Poisons, and as
they are either inimicall only to the Genus Nervosum, they do infect that only,
or the Brain also with it, and so produce Convulsions; where, the Brain being
hurt or disafected withal, other accidents do continue in the organ of the
Senses after the Convulsive fit is over, especially in an Alienation of mind
and depraved motion. Among these Poisonous causes, that sometimes offers it
self, which by its propriety, and private hurt brings forth the symptom of a
Catalepsy, rather than of a true Convulsion. Yet because it is a Disease very
seldom happening, it evidently demonstrates, that seldom such a Venenate
Quality is raised or breed in us, which may produce or excite such an affect in
our Bodies: but very often that, which stirs up Epilepsies and Convulsions: Now
of what kind soever that is, its fountain and original sometimes lurks
intrinsecally in the Brain, or Bowels or Veins, or in the habit of the Body;
and som^imes Extrinsecally to the Body.

20. Sometimes Convulsions vehement and of long continuance have been caused
from the corruption or Apostemation of the Membranes of the Brain, by reason of
a filthy vapor raised from them, and at set times entering the Ventricles of
the Brain; as Fernelius once observed in the dissection of an Epileptick: yet
this cause for the most part, possessing the substance of the Brain, or its
Ventricles, should rather induce an Apoplexy, than Convulsions. However, in the
mean season we do not deny, but that the cause of an Epilepsy or Convulsions
may oftentimes lie in the Head; for that we meet with many faults within the
skull; in the membranes of the Brain, in its substance, and in it humors, which
raging with their poisonous and malign quality (at set times, as the nature of
the Venom may be) by provoking the Membranes and Genus Nervosum, do cause
either a long continued, and almost incurable Epilepsie; or Vehement and horrid
Convulsions.

21. But the nature of the Venenate cause, as also of other Poisons, we can no
otherwise know, than as by dissections made, sometimes a speck, or little spot
is discovered; sometimes some black or frothy humor, in some inward part of the
skull, or bone, or membrane, or Brain it self: and sometimes nothing at all can
be discerned: But then that it is of a poisonous quality, we gather from this,
for that there is no manifest cause, of any great moment, yet nevertheless such
horrid symptoms are produced, which although they kill not the sick, will yield
to no remedies.

22. This Venenate cause, also lying in the Bowels, may produce the like long
continued and rebellious Epilepsies or Convulsions; as Poisons taken into the
Stomach and Guts, which have sometimes the properly of begetting an Epilepsy or
Convulsions: Or meat changed into the nature of Poison: Or Excrements assuming
a Venenate quality contained in those places, as also in the Womb, or other
parts. Of all which that these are the causes, and do lie in the Veins, is
known and judged, from the affctes concuring with them; Or from others offering
themselves about the Praecordia and Heartstrings; or in the Veins; Or from the
disaffection of the Stomach or Womb.

23. The Veins in like manner, if they be filled with Malign and Poisonous
humors of this kind, as it often hapens in Malignant and Pestilential diseases,
as such as are Epidemicall and Contagious, where the Malignancy does besiege
the Heart, and more especially the Genus Nervosum, do after a more particular
manner excite deadly Convulsions, such as are wont to happen in Fevers; so
much not by reason of the great hurt of the Nerves from extreme heat, as from
the venenate quality of the humor assaulting the Animal spirits both in the
Blood and Nerves. Or, if without any such Pestilential, Epidemical or
Contagious disease, the humors heaped up in the Veins, should be changed into a
Poisonous property, inimical to the Brain and Nerves, then Epileptical
Convulsions would rather be induced, than the others, more especially if the
Melancholy humor should meet with such a transformation, which sometimes brings
along with it a deep hypochondriacal Melancholy, foolishness, frenzy, or
Madness; and from this cause does proceed a long continued and incurable
Epilepsie:

24. Moreover as a Venenate cause raised from the same, may cause some short
Madness (being produced from matter collected in the Meseraick veins whether
Lacteal or other;) so that may also produce rather Epileptick Convulsions than
Hypochondriacal Melancholy, whence also some think that a Catalepsie is caused;
which we hold to arise from subtle Vavapours ascending from a contaminated
malign or venenate Melancholy humor, and with a Vehement and sudden motion,
striking or smiting the Animal spirits and Genus Nervosum.

25. Also, in Women, such matter is wont more usually to be heaped up in or
about the Vains of the Womb, where also the Blood retained and corrupted,
(rather than the seed, which seldom is affected with such a Malignity, except
in the furor, rage, or Madness of the Womb) does cause Convulsions, such as are
often to be seen in Virgins and Women Hysterical, who never yet had their
Courses, or have them praeternaturally stopped, whether before or after Childing.

26. That the like quality may be bred or contained in the habit of the body,
which may cause Convulsions or Epilepsies, experience does daily testify: from
which Galen and Fernelius write, they have observed that Air in an Epileptick
Child ascending from his Foot, in one example; and the like air or Vapor
running from the Crown, through the outward parts of the Head, in an other
example, did cause Epileptick fits, as often as they came or returned, and this
very thing, I my self have three or four times observed in so many special
examples, wherein the air or vapor ascending upwards, seemed to the Sick, as
if he had put his Foot, Leg, or Arm, leisurely into cold water, deeper and
deeper, the vapors gradually proceeding not much unlike to the rising of the
cold superficies of the said water. And it has also been sometimes observed,
that an Air or Vapor, running from the Hand, where afterward an Apostem has
bred, as also from the Feet or upper places, has don the like.

27. That the like Poison entering the body from without, many cause Convulsions
or Epilepsies, for the like reason; as the bitting of Venomous Beasts,
especially of the Viper, or a mad Dog, the sting of Scorpions, the reception of
Arsenick, sublimate, or other venenate and Corosive things, the same quotidian
Experience does largely witness: and particularly in the biting of a mad Dog,
besides the symptom of Madness, and other cruel indications, Convulsions are
at length excited, through the Malignity of the Venene spirit, whereby the
Patient is carried off; and I once saw Convulsions arise from poisonous smells,
hastily assaulting the Animal spirits in the Brain; which was don in a lusty
young Man who hastily and unadvisedly received the fumes of very strong spirit
of Niter, by which he was immediately cast into most cruel Convulsion fits.

28. These things being premised, for the better understanding of the matter;
we shall now come to deliver our Observation; which is of a Convulsion arising
from a hurt of the Genus Nervosum by a blow received on the hinder part of the
Head and vertebrae of the Neck, how great the blow was, I will not determine;
this I am sure of, it brought dreadful Convulsions upon the sick, so vehement
that life was despaired of.

29. The sick was immediately committed to a warm bed, Roger Dixon the
Chyrurgian and my self being sent for: the fits often returned, for the
strength of the Convulsive motion being spent, and the fit as it were going
off, the sick scarcely seemed to be free; but new Convulsions were forthwith
excited: Roger was for letting him Blood; which although it was a blow, I was
in this cause utterly against, believing that if any such evacuation was
necessary, that Nature would provoke it, however in the mean season all the
external parts behind were bathed, first with the Queen of Hungaries water,
then with the Powers of Amber, and that not slightly: also some few drops of
the Powers of Rosemary were conveyed up his Nostrills, they, as also his
Forehead and Temples, being extremely well bathed therewith; by which without
doubt the Brain and Animal spirits were conforted.

30. But in less than six hours after the blow, (by reason I suppose of the
adhibition of the Powers of Rosemary to the Nostills) a vehement Haemorrhage
followed, in which the sick bled by the Nostrills at least a quart of Blood:
seeing so exceeding great an evacuation, we did our endeavor to stop it: to
his Forehead, this Cataplasm was applied: Take the white of an new laid Egg,
Terra sigillata, one ounce: fine Bole, a sufficient quantity: mix and make a
Pultise; which was applied with hards of flax upon Leather, as aforesaid: all
the extreme parts were strongly bound with good Ligature: the Testicles were
also bound, and fomented with Venegar; the sick was laid upon his back, and the
powder of Toads was blown up his Nostrills with a Quill; and a dried Toad was
given him to hold in his Hand: Moreover the Crown of his Head was shaved, and a
Vesicatory applied thereto: by the use of this means, the Haemorrage was in a
short time stopped and the Vehemence and swift return of the Convulsions slakt,
whereby the Patient had some ease.

31. In about six or seven hours more his bleeding was again excited, so that
it was supposed, that he lost at least three pints more of blood, and then it
was stopped again, by the use of the means aforesaid: This extreme bleeding
doubtless mightily weakened the Patient, yet certainly delivered him from all
future danger of an Apoplexy or other mortal Diseases of the Brain, which
otherwise might have happened.

32. But now whereas his Body was exceedingly bound, so as he had not been at
stool in above six days, no doubt but it was of evil consequence in this case,
and therefore I ordered the exhibition of this following Clyster: Take fresh
roots of Lillys and Peony, of each two ounces: leaves of Mallows, Beets, garden
Arach, Sage, Centory the less, of each a handful: flowert of Lavender,
Staechas, Rosemary, Camomil, of each a pugil: Peony seeds, Wheat bran, of each
two drams: Caraways, one dram: make a decoction, and strain: to a pint hereof
add juice of Beets, brown Sugar, of each an ounce: Hiera picra, Hirae Logadij,
of each two drams: Oy^ of Amber, a dram: salt, half a dram: mix and make a
Clyster: This was exhibited, and it wrought gently and plesantly upon him; and
he confessed himself much the better.

33. To Comfort him, by the mouth, I gave this: Take Aqua Coelestis, Aqua
Mirabilis, of each one ounce: Angelica water the greater composition, half an
ounce: Peony water, syrup of Betony, of each two ounces: syrup of Limons, one
ounce: mix them: of this the sick took now and then a spoonful, which
exceedingly cheared his spirits, and Corroborated his Animal faculties, now
very much hurt.

34. Every six hours also, I caused the parts aforenamed to be bathed with the
Powers of Amber and Rosemary mixed, of each a like quantity, as also all the
back bone from the highest Vertebra of the Neck to the Os Coccigis; all the
joints and extreme parts, together with the Stomach, Hypochonders, and
Testicles, whereby the whole Nervous system was strengthened, and truly
restored: And although I must confess that inward Medicines are of mighty use
in Convulsions; yet I am fully persuaded, and confirmed herein by very large
experience, that external Medicaments, of a heating Anodyne resolving and
neurotick property, do much more contribute to this Cure, as sooner reaching
the parts hurt (except the Convulsion be first excited in the Bowels by
poison, violent purges, a Vehement Diarrhea the Cholick, etc. and yet in this
Case when the Genus Nervosum comes to be universally afflicted, externalls,
(such as those before named, are of most admirable use,) and this thing I could
not but communicate to all the sons of Art, for the sake and benefit of the
poor afflicted patients.

35. The Chyrurgian, my assistant, would needs have the Sick constantly to take
of the following wine, a quarter of a pint or better morning, noon, and night,
about half an hour before eating, the which he told me, He had found large
experience of; and doubtless it is a very good thing: Take Rhenish wine, choice
Canary, of each a gallon: Peony roots, and seeds bruised, Misleto of the Oak,
thick Galangal, Calamus Aromaticus, Zedoary, Aracardiums, of each an ounce and
half: flowers of Lavender and Rosemary, of Staechas and Saffron, of each two
ounces: Betony, Bawm, Calamint, Mint, Sweetmarojram, flowers of Lilly convally,
of each half a handful: Wormwood, a larg handful: digest all for eight or ten
days: then decant of the clear wine, and let the Patient drink it: but it will
be good to let the wine stand upon the Ingredients close stopped up, during the
whole time of the drinking: this Wine the sick took: but I prescribed him to
take it either with, or immediately after the taking of the following powder:
Take roots and seeds of Peony, Misleto of the Oak, Elks hoof, skull of a dead
Man, of each half an ounce: Swallows dried and poudred, Peacocks dung, Nutmegs,
Cloves, of each six drams: Musk, one ounce: make of all a very fine powder: the
dose from a scruple to two scruples: according to age and strength: This our
Patient took half a dram thereof thrice a day, with Roger Dixons wine
aforementioned; by the use of which things he prefectly recovered.

36. He was exceeding weak for a long time, and upon the taking of the least
cold, or overstraining himself, or lifting any thing beyond his strength, his
Convulsions were very apt to return for more than eight weeks together; for
which cause sake we the more earnestly pressed upon him the constant assiduous
use of the aforesaid Medicaments, till such time as he found his perfect
restoration: and for the keeping of his body soluble, I ordered him often to
repeat the aforementioned Clyster: moreover, after about five or six weeks
time, I began to purge his Body, which I did with my Family Pills with Aloes;
and this was done once a week for a month together.

37. That the hurt in this Patient was great, was apparent, and that the Genus
Nervosum, or whole Nervous System was grieved, was almost without question, for
that the Convulsion seized every part from Head to Foot, leaving him no where
free that we could discern; and the iteration of the fits were such at the
first, as for the most part deprived him of all his senses, except that of
feeling; and yet notwithstanding all this, the blow was not so great, as to
make a wound outward; but from thence the Chyrurgian took his more dangerous
prognostics: however, such was the force thereof, as to break some of the
Sanguineous vessels within the Brain, as was manifest from that very great flux
of Blood, which Roger confidently affirmed came from the Cavities within the
Skull: and without which evacuation, the fick must have inevitably perished.

XV. Convulsion fits in a Child new born.

1. It was a little Girl, born dead, to appearance; but after a little time
revived again; in less than half an hour after she was taken with Convulsions
fits: My advice, (being accidentally present) was desired: the Face of the
Child was all over black, as it were, and its whole body trembled: in the
middle of the fit, about a spoonful of water fell out of its right Nostril.

2. I immediately advised to the following thing: Take Oil of Cinnamon, one
drop, mix it with a little Virgin honey very well; to this add six or eight
drops of the Blood Squeezed out of the Navel-string, and a spoonful of breast
Milk: mix them, and give it the Child: This was done, and the Child was
forthwith restored: I ordered it to be repeated, and also to be given if the
Child should have any more fits, in the fit: The Infant had a second fit; but
by three or four times giving thereof was perfectly Cured.

3. I cured another new born Babe, by the same prescription; and have advised
it to several, where it has always very well succeeded: moreover where the
Child has been older, so that the blood of the Navel-string could not begotten;
I have cured them by giving two or three grains of the Navel string in powder;
which is a singular experiment worth the remarking.

4. A Child ten days old was seized with Convulsions, which I cured with this:
Take Breast milk, a spoonful or two; of my Guttae Vitae, four or six drops; mix
them, and give it the Child twice or thrice a day. A child two months old was
cured with this: Take choice Canary half a spoonful; of my Guttae Vitae, six
(...) eight drops, mix them: This was given, and repeated, three or four times
a day: and although the Infant had four or five several fits in twelve hours
space, yet by taking of this Medicament it was perfectly recovered.

5. Another Child, about two or three months old, seized with strong
Convulsions, arising as I conceived, from Wind, I cured with this: Take choice
Canary, a little spoonful; powers of Carraways, Guttae Vitae, of each six
drops, mix them and give it: this was given about four times a day: and in two
days time, was freed from its fits: many other Children of the same Age, and
some elder, I have cured with the same prescription, save, as their a^e was
greater, I augmented the dose both of the powers of Carraways, and Guttae Vitae
accordingly.

6. The Oil of Cinnamon is a specific in this Case, and I have often times
given it with admirable success, but that is not every where to be got, and
therefore somewhat else must be substituted in its room; if that therefore be
wanting, I scarcely know any thing better than the powers of Caraways and my
Guttae Vitae, to which if you add two or three grains of the powder of the
Navel string, you will not do a miss: I have cured many Children with these
things, and as far as I can remember, never yet so much as once exhibited them
in Vain.

7. And indeed all those things which comfort the Vitals, and refresh or give
respite to Animal spirits must be good and proper here, such are the Tinctura
aurea, Tintura Vitae, Tinctura diaphoretica Paracelsi, and all Neuroticks, of
what kind or quality soever; yet this is to be understood, that by so much as
they are made more spiritual, by so much the more admirable they are; and
operate with the greater celerity and certainty; and therefore the Spirits,
Potestates or Volatile Salt of Man's skull, or of Elks hoof, of Vipers,
Swallows, Magpies, Peony, Amber, etc, much transcend any gross or terrene
preparation of them, wherein the Volatile and pure parts are clothed and
clogged with the Earthy, etc.

XVI. Convulsion fits in a young Lady arising from terror an^ ^ffrightment.

1. This Lady from a sudden consternation of mind or affrightment, was
immediately seized with Convulsions; so that, falling into a fit, her whole
Body seemed to be contracted, from Head to Foot, with intolerable Pain or
dolor, no other apparent cause going before, she being one of a very healthful
and sound constitution and habit of body, and of a pleasant merry disposition.

2. These fits came at uncertain times, without any order, and took her many
times at great disadvantages, especially upon the least commotion of the mind,
or disturbance of the spirit, Anger, or Affrightment, as the going over a
dangerous bridge, looking down from a very high place, presence of a Serpent,
Toad, Spider, or such like: and sometimes also they would seize her in her
sleep, especially if she was dreaming of any frightful matter: They were also
so often iterated, that in a very few weeks she became as it were a Changling.

3. By reason of this Vehement affliction, many obstructions were bred in her
Body; together with a stoppage of her Terms: she had also contracted a paleness
of Face weakness of the Stomach, indigestion, nauseousness or lothing, want of
Appetite, hoarsness, and Cough, with a certain kind of wheezing; and in short,
the whole habit of her Body was altered, her strength impaired, and her mind in
some sort alienated; and this purely through the frequency, and vehemence of
the Disease, and long continuance of the Spasmatick Paroxysm:

4. Her Friends requested my help; and having well viewed the Patient, and
considered the Disease, as aforesaid, I began the Cure with purging of her; for
which purpose I gave her a dose of my Family Pills with Aloes; which I caused
her to take twice a week, for three weeks together, with due observation as in
other purges: after three weeks time, I ordered her to take them only once a
week, and to continue the use of the same for five or six weeks, which she
accordingly did; by which the nauseousness and loathing at Stomach was removed,
and she was in a little time brought to a good Appetite, and to digest her food
very well: moreover by the same means her Terms were provoked and made to flow
in good order.

5. And by reason that in the Absence of the fit, she complained of a most
Vehement pain of her Head, I caused her hair to be shaved off, and the common
Vesicatory of the shops to be applied: which done, and the blister removed, I
caused it to be drawn three or four days with Colewort-leaves, applying the
smooth side to the Sore, on the fourth day, I ordered the rough side to be
applied, by which means in about thee days more, her Head was healed up: by
these blisters her mother told me, she believed, above two quarts of humor
evacuated.

6. In the mean season, whilst she took her Pills, I was not unmindful of what
was further to be done: But as I was consulting, some of her Relations, were
for sending for other Doctors, especially some of the College, of whom Dr. T:
and Dr. B: were sent for: with whom, although I was not unwilling to consult
for the good of my Patient, yet I desired to be excused, and that they might
act apart; but with promise, that if things succeeded not, I would reassume my
Task, and do the best I could for my Patient, as if nothing had been.

7. These Gentlemen, having seen the Patient, and consulted what was, as they
thought most fit for her, at last concluded upon these Things. First they
ordered this purging ApoZem to be given her: Take roots of Cyperus,
Flower-de-luce, Angelica, Zedoary and of Elecampane, if each one ounce: leaves
of Betony, Marjoram, Bawn, Pennyroyal, Origanum, Calamint, of each an handful:
of the tops of Time, and Sage, of each half a handful: seeds of Annis,
Hartwort, Fennel, of each three drams: Liquorice scraped, Raisons stoned, of
each one ounce: choice Sena, two ounces: Carthamus seeds bruised, fresh
polypody of the Oak, of each one ounce: Agapick Trochiscated, Turbith,
Hermodacts, of each three drams: Ginger, Cloves, of each one dram: Staechas,
Rosemary, Sage, and Lavender flowers, of each one pugil: boil them in fair
water to a quart, strain and add four ounces of white Sugar, Clarify it, and
Aromatize it with Cinnamon, two drams: This she took at four times in four
mornings: and in the two last draughts they caused Diacarthamum, six drams, to
be dissolved, which she drank with care of taking Cold.

8. This done, they caused her to be anointed with this following Liniment:
Take old Butter, fat Bacon, of each a quarter of a pound: Bdellium, Ammoniacum,
of each one ounce: Myrrh, Castor, of each two drams: flowers of Staechas and
Rosemary, of each one pugil: Nutmeg Cloves, of each one dram: a young Cat
stead, bowelled, and cut in pieces: put all these things into the belly of a
Goose, and roast her very well, cast away the first dripping which is watery;
and the next which is fatty, receive in a vessel half full of Vinegar: with
this they caused all the back bone, and other places afflicted to be anointed.
This was used for a while, but not prevailing, they prescribed the following.

9. Take Oils of Violets, of Roses, of each three ounces: Oils of Foxes, and of
Camomil, of each two ounces: Mucilage of Althea roots, of Faenugreek, and
Line-seed, four ounces; white Wax a sufficient quantity: mix, and make an
Ointment; with this in like manner, the Spine and other parts Convulsed were
morning and evening anointed; for ten or twelve days: after which this
following was ordered: Take oil of Castor, and of Earth worms, Oleum de
Lateribus, of each two ounces: water of Juniper Berries, half an ounce: with
wax a small quantity, mix and make a Liniment: with this the Vertebrae of the
Neck and all the back bone was anointed, as also the Forehead. Temples, and
other parts affected. And for the Coroborating or strengthening of the Sick they
ordered this: Take Conserves of Violets, of Bugloss, and of Roses, of each half
an ounce: flesh of River, Crabs well boiled and cut small, one ounce: Species
Diamargarit frigid, two drams: Pine nuts, half an ounce: Sugar dissolved in
Rose Water, half a pound; mix and make morsells; to be eaten at pleasure.

10. All these things were don for a month or more according to order, but
without the least appearance of amendm^^^ whereupon, and by reason of the
filthyness of the last Ointment, the Patient entreated her Relation that she
might give over the use of those Doctors; and make use of her old Physician;
upon which my help was entreated again: I then ordered her the going on and
continuing of her Pills, as aforementioned; and to clear, her Body from those
filthy and stinking Ointments which had been so long used about her, prescribed
this following bath: Take Rosemary, Lavender, Sage, Betony, Marjoram, Origanum,
Hyssop, Time, Camomel, Fennel, Carduus, Scordium, Wormwood, Centory the less,
Featherfew, of each a handful: Aniseeds, Caraways, and Fennel-seeds, of each
two ounces: all bruised: yellow Sulphur, a pound: Roach Alum, four ounces: Salt
of Tartar, two ounces: boil all in a sufficient quantity of water for a bath;
in which let the Sick be put warm, that she may be cleansed: The bath being
made, she was put into it, was well cleanswd by rubbing with the Herbs, and sat
in it, with much delectation for about half an hour; after which she was taken
out and put into a warm Bed.

11. Being in her warm bed, I caused her to be bathed with the following
mixture: Take Powers of Amber, fourteen ounces: Powers of Sassafras, Rosemary,
Juniper Berries, Sage, Savin, of each two ounces: Powers of Oranges, Limons,
Caraways, Rhodium, of each an ounce: mix and bath the Vertebrae of the Neck and
Back bone, with all other parts affected with the Convulsion: by the use of
this at the very first time she found comfort; and in two or three days time,
had plain demonstrations of a Cure; besides it was a neat, cleanly Medicine,
not daubing nauseous and loathsome, as were the former and no sooner was it laid
on or used, but the part was immediately dry, as if nothing had been applied,
which was a great satisfaction to this our nice and curious Patient: she was
bathed therewith Morning and Evening for about sixteen days time: afterward for
about three weeks, she Was only bathed at night going to bed; at the end of
which time she found her self to be perfectly cured.

12. But that we may not let the industrious Artist know things by halves; he
is to understand, that during this whole Cure, in the intervalls of Purging,
Specific Antispasmaticks, and Corroboratives were continually taken by the
Patient: every morning fasting this: Take powers of Rosemary, of Sage, and
Pennyroyal, of each three ounces: Aqua Caelestis, four ounces: syrup of
Limons: twelve ounces: mix them: dose one spoonful in a glass of Sack: Every
night going to bed this following Electuary was given: Take Electuarium ad
Tabidos, six ounces: Conserves of Betony and Rosemary flowers, of each one
ounce: filings of Elks hoofs, and of Ox horns, of each six drams: powers of
Wormwood, two ounces: mix them: dose the quantity of a Nutmeg, drinking after
it a little glass of Sack or other wine. ThiS disease was stubborn and
rebellious, and did not easily admit of remedy, yet by the constant use of the
aforementioned powerful Medicaments was at length conquered and overcome.

XVII. Convulsions arising from the pricking of a Nerve or Tendon.

1. A lusty young Man being let blood by an unskilful or carless Chyrurgian,
had the Nerve or Tendon lying under pricked by the point of the Lancet,
whereupon the Man presently fell into Convulsions fits. Upon which three or
four other Chyrurgians were presently called: some were for cutting the Nerve
asunder, others were for laying it bare and so making application.

2. Objections were raised against both ways: by the first it was objected, The
use of the member would be lost for ever: by the second, That the Patient would
be put to a great deal more of exquisite Pain whereby th Convulsion might be
increased, and the sick put in manifest danger.

3. While all these great men were in consultation what to do; a Chyrurgians
boy there also present, (a bold youth) clapped to the bleeding wound a piece of
Sponge dipped in Oil of Turpentine, and so bound it up, withal giving the Man a
little a Aqua Mirabilis, out of a bottle which he had in his pocket, then
caused some servants there present to lay him down upon a bed: by this means
the Convulsions was retrieved, and the wound and puncture of the Nerve, healed
and consolidated, so that there was no need of a second application, or use of
any other Medicament. See what great things are somtime^ done suddenly and
unexpected, and that by small and trifling remedies. The boy, only did this
extemporanee or upon the spot, whilst wiser heads than his (as he thought) were
consulting upon more mature and fit applications.

4. Once since, I was occasionally in the Country, where I saw such a like
accident done by a Chyrurgian, letting a Man blood in the Arm; I immediately,
ordered the same application, gave the man a little Aqua Celestis, and caused
him to be laid down upon a bed to repose himself; by which alone application,
the Man was retrieved out of the Convulsion, and restored to his perfect
health, without the least hurt to the use of his Arm.

XVIII. A Convulsion which seized a Man, after great Repletion.

1. A Man about forty five years of age, being invited to Supper, drunk
liberally and plentifully; insomuch, that by his large eating and drinking he
plainly surfeited himself: after Supper was over, he began to be very sick, and
desired to vomit, but could not: his sickness grew extreme upon him, so that,
forthwith he was forced to be conveyed home; where he was got to bed; but he
had not been in it long before his sickness came to that extremity, that life
was dispaired of; the Man all this while not Vomiting, and his sickness still
increasing, a violent Fever seized upon him, with putrefaction of the humors,
and about midnight by reason of the vehemence of his sickness and Fever, he
was taken with Convulsion fits.

2. Upon this a Doctor was sent for, who prescribed, to the sick a rich
Cordial, which was made and given him, but without any effect, the Man's
sickness still increasing upon him, and upon extremities of disaffections at
heart, violent Convulsions: after this manner he lay till morning, taking at
times the Doctors Cordial, and suffering at fits those Convulsions: he had
eight Paroxysms before ten a clock the next day.

3. This not doing, some of his Friends sent for me; to whom they gave the
former relation: by which, I preceived that Surfeiting was the original cause
of his distemper, a Convulsion being present, through repletion: The other man
being discharged, I attempted to do the best I could: I gave him first a good
Vomit, which was this: Take Infusion of Crocus metallorum, an ounce: Salt of
Vitriol, half a dram: mix them for a dose: He took this, and it gave seven
Vomits, and three stools: by which the poor sick Creature had a very great
relief: almost all the Supper he eat came up, some partundigested; other part
of it corrupted and putrefied with a noysom stink.

4. After the Vomit I caused him to take this Corroborative: Take Aqua
Caelestis, three ounces: Bawm-water, two ounces: syrup of Limons, an ounce an
half: syrup of Meconium, half an ounce: mix them; of which he took now and than
a spoonful. In the mean season, I caused his Fore head, Temples, and Nostrills,
to be bathed with the powers of Amber, as also the Backbone, from the nape of
the Neck to the Os Coccigis, and to be duly repeated morning and evening, for
three or four days together, by which he found very much Good.

5. But by reason the Surfeit was so great as to cause Convulsions, and by
reason I feared his Stomach was very foul, and not yet sufficiently cleansed
with the first Vomit, I caused the same to be repeated the very next day: and
that indeed, went not without its desired effects: for it brought up a much
greater quantity of filthyness and corruption than the former, giving the
Patient about six or seven Vomits and four Stools: and, its very probable, that
this might have a greater and better effect than the first, by reason the first
might loosen a great part of that filthy matter, which the latter brought away;
and which without a primary dose could never have been evacuated: The third day
following the same dose was again repeated (although (...) the second Vomit,
the sick had no more Convulsions fits:) upon the fourth day after that, I gave
him a dose of my Family pills, which wrought admirably upon him, and gave him
twelve stools, after which I concluded his body to be very well cleansed, and
thoroughly freed from that perilous Surfeit.

6. However because he was mightily weakened, not only by the force of the
Convulsion, fits (which followed him close for the time) but also by means of
these strong Vomits, and much purging, I thought to prescribe something to him,
which might strengthen and corroborate his weakened body, and confirm the tone
of the Stomach, so much debilitated both with the corrupt matter therein
contained, and the operation of the exhibited purges: Take Electuarium ad
Tabidos, Venice Treacle, of each two ounces: Conserve of Barberries, four
ounces: mix, and with syrup of Quinces, a sufficient quantity make a Lohoch to
be licked of, now and then. Also in the morning fasting, half an hour before
Dinner, and as long before Supper, I ordered the Powers of Mint, to be taken
forty or fifty drops at a time, in a small gl^ss of Sack, or other Wine. These
things he took for about eight days: at the end of which time, for a farther
confirmation of his Health, (which now was present) I advised him to take every
Morning and Night two spoonfulls or three, of the following mixture: Take of
the best Cinnamon water, a quart: syrup of Quinces, syrup of Limons, of each
eight ounces: mix them together and keep them for use, to be taken, as
aforesaid.

7. It is wonderful to me, that great and learned men, and Doctors of Physic,
should be so much mistaken, as to prescribe a strong Cordial in Convulsions
proceeding from Repletion, and great Surfeit; when common sense might have told
one, that there was a hurt of the Ventricle, and of its Functions or faculties,
by means of the abundance of matter contained within the same: but this is often
the fate of the poor Patient, when he falls into the Claws or Hands of an
unconsidering man: Had I taken the same course, and followed the ^ame
prescription, it might have been doomsday in the afternoon, before I had seen
the recovery of this miserable Soul: from such Doctors, let all Sick people cry
Libera nos Domine.

XIX. Convulsion fits in a middle aged Woman, arising from Pains of the Stone.

1. This person having been long afflicted with the Stone, pains in her Back
and Reins; and with the Cholick, as she imagined, was at length so exceedingly
toutored, as that upon the access of any Paroxysm she would fall into
Convulsion fits, which fits would also be repeated several times upon any small
occasion, in the intermissions of the Nephritick Dolor.

2. Her Husband sent for me, in one of her extremities, and requested my help:
I saw that the Sick was weak, and that her Disease had made a deep impression
upon her; that it was dubious whether she would recover or no; and that without
speedy relief she must inevitably perish; lastly, that the abating of the
symptoms, and aleviating of her pains, was first to be attempted, before we
meddled with the Cause, because they threatened the life of the sick most.

3. Upon these considerations, I first (because her body was bound) exhibited
this following Clyster: Take decoctum Commune, a pint: Oil Olive, Honey,
Infusion of Crocus metalorum, of each two ounces: mix them, and let it be put
up warm: this gave her some ease, loosned her body, and gave her four or five
stools.

4. After the Exhibition of the Clyster, I gave her three grains of my
Laudanum, with a little glass of Sack, which gave her mighty relief; and this I
ordered to be continued for several Nights together; she took it with good
success for about a month, with repetition of the Clyster aforesaid every third
or fourth day.

5. But by reason of the Extremities of her pains, and the many repeated
Convulsions, she complained of a mighty weakness all over her, especially in
her Back, Loins, and Joints, so that I concluded, there was a great hurt of the
Genus Nervosum; the weakness was so great that she could not stand alone, nor
scarcely turn her in her bed: I therefore caused her to be well bathed, Morning
and Night, with the following mixture: Take powers of Amber, eight ounces:
powers of Limoms, and Oranges, of each four ounces: powers of Sweet-marjoram;
two ounces: mix them, and keep them in a glass close stopped for use.

6. With that mixture her Head, Temples, nape of the Neck, and all along down
the Back bone, to the Os coccigis with the whole Abdomen or Belly, and all her
joints, both in Arms and Legs; were exceedingly well bathed, and this bathing
was continued for about twelve or fourteen days, so that her Convulsion fits so
totally vanished, as that she had no more of them: And that we might
Corroborate her inward parts also, I ordered her to take alternatim, a spoonful
of the Spirit of Saffron, and the like quantity of powers of Cinnamon, that is
to say, one day Spirit of Saffron, and the next day, the Powers of Cinnamon:
for that Nature is delighted with Variety as well as Congruity, and although
one of those Cordialls might have been enough; for the strengthening and
encouraging of her, and for chearing of the Spirits, yet the Stomach is
delighted with diversity of Medicaments of the same kind, which is a remark
worthy the noting: for if the Stomach refuses what is given, and its tone be
weakened, by the unity and likeness or sameness of things, all other
Medicaments, destinated against the Disease, are certainly given in vain.

7. Respit being given to this Our sick Patient, and in some measure restored
from her so great weakness by the Exhibition of Opiats and Cordialls, with the
external application of the Powers aforementioned, I ordered the Chyrurgian, R.
D. my particular Friend, to make a search for the stone, which he plainly felt,
and with dexterous Art, extracted it by Instrument through the Meatus
Vrinarius: it came forth in two pieces, or else there was two stones: about the
bigness of large Nutmegs, with some lesser stones, about the bigness of gray
Pease, or Cherry-stones.

8. This done for the cleansing of those parts of Sand or Gravel; and
prevention for the future, the breeding of any more stones, I prescribed her
the following Electuary: Take Venice Treacle, eight ounces: powers of
Juniper-beries, two ounces: Elixir of Vitriol, one ounce: Confectio Anodyna,
three ounces: mix them: of this she took the quantity of two drams, morning and
night, till the whole was exhausted; at the end of which she seemed to be
perfectly well; nor did I hear, that she ever complained after: yet this thing
is to be especially noted, that during this whole Cure, all her drink was an
Infusion of raspings of Lignum Nephriticum, sometimes in white or Rhenish wine,
sometimes in pure clear Ale, and sometimes in Hydropiper water; and with almost
all her food or meat, I caused her to eat Oil of sweet Almonds by expression,
or pure Oil Olive, by which the passages and Pores of the Urine were all made
slippery, whereby the Nephritick and diuretic Medicaments exhibited, operated
with so much the more facility and safety.

XX. Convulsion fits (in a Woman thirty years of Age) joined with Hysteric
fits.

1. This miserable creature for five or six years had heen exceedingly
afflicted with those fits, and all things whatsoever that various Physicians
could think of, in order to her Cure, was exhibited with all possible care and
circumspection, yet without the least hope of remedy; so that being given over
to despair, she resolved to make no more trial of any other Medicament;
moreover she was grown exceeding weak, and her Body pined away, as if she was
in a deep Consumption.

2. But some of her Friends knowing of me, gave me an account of her condition,
and withal, once more persuaded her, to make a proof of my skill, for that
they had a strong belief that I (if any one could) might be an Instrument in
the hand of God, for restoring her to her desired Health.

3. I first of all gently purged her with my Family Pills with Aloes, and
repeated the purgation every fifth or six^^ day, for five times; by which means
her Courses (which had been stopped for more than two years) were admirably
provoked, upon the seeing of which, I ordered the continuation of the same,
once a week, for twelve or fourteen weeks together, which she accordingly did,
both to her own and my exceeding satisfaction.

4. During all this time, in the intermediate days of Purging; I gave her
inwardly the following composition: Take choice Musk in fine powder, two drams:
Salt of Man's skull, a dram and half: Oil of Peony-seeds, one dram: Salt of
Vipers, Amber-grise, in fine powder, of each half a dram: with choice Venice
Treacle, or Our Electuarium ad Tabidos, and oil of Nutmegs by expression, of
each two drams: make a mass: dose half a dram at night going to bed, and to be
continued for a month complete, without intermission, except the evening before
the day of purging.

5. Moreover, I ordered her to sit in a sulphur bath, as long as she could bear
it, and immediately coming out of it, and, being dried with cloths, to be
extremely well bathed with the powers of Amber alone; or with this mixture:
Take powers of Amber, eight ounces: powers of Limons, of Oranges, of Rosemary,
of each three ounces: mix them, with this her whole body from Head, to Foot was
bathed, immediately coming out of the bath, as also morning and night, at other
times, by the use of which things she found an unexpressible good, and in a
short time a perfect cure.

6. However by reason she complained of a fullness and heaviness at her
Stomach, I resolved to give her a Vomit, which I did with extraordinary good
Success, with my white Emetick Troches or Lozenges, made of Mercurius Vitae;
they gave her six vomits and three stools ( viz. half a dram of the Lozenges,
which contained about three grains of the Mercurius Vitae) After the taking of
this Vomit but once, she became so pleasant and easy, that she thought her self
in Heaven.

7. By these examples and many more which, I might hereafter set forth, it is
manifest of how great force the Powers of Medicaments are in general, and in
particular the Powers of Amber, as also those of Limons, Oranges, Rosemary,
Sassafras, etc: for that in a moment they comfort and restore the whole Genus
Nervosum and that even by External application, in which manner of use they do
more (in a small quantity) momentarily, than a Cart load of other Medicaments
can do though given inwardly: now if they do such great things by bare outward
application, what may they do being also inwardly given, especially in all
those Diseases where the Cause is more inward? but their operations are not
wonderful, if we consider their absolute purity, subtilty, and Volatility, with
their Comfortative and mighty penetrative power and force.

XXI. A vehement Cramp in the Calves of both the Legs, and other Parts.

1. A man of about thirty years of Age was much troubled with the Cramp in the
Calves of his Legs, sometimes it was in one Leg, sometimes in the other, and
sometimes in both; and sometimes it would seize other Parts, as the brawny part
of the Arm, under the Chin, etc.

2. The Convulsion would be vehement causing a Tumor of the Nerves in the
middle of the Musculous Part, as big as ones Fist doubled, which in a quarter
of an hour or thereabouts would resolve, and go totally away, yet for the most
part leaving a great Soreness and Weakness, and such an exceeding Debility as
that he was not able to go for a day or two, or sarcely set his Foot on the
Ground.

3. He had tried many things but without Effect, as well Internals as
Externals: and outwardly almost all the Galenick hot Oils and Ointments had
been applied, but in vain, as aforesaid; and now his Disease increased more and
more upon him, in so much, that upon the least Cold, the Cramp would seize him
upon those Parts, and with such Violence and Torture, to make him roar and cry
vehemently out, as if he had been a killing: and, if in bed he durst not many
times thrust his Feet straight down, or put them in a cold Place, or yawn, for
fear of a Fit of the Cramp taking hold of him, which for the time afflicted him
with that Vehemence, that he has many times said, He believed it to exceed the
very pangs of Death.

4. At length he made his Complaint to me, and I perceiving it to come
absolutely from a cold Cause, caused him to bath the Part very well with the
Powers of Amber, twice a day, viz. Morning and Evening, and to continue the use
thereof for some few days, to wit, eight or ten, or more; this he did, and in
less then fourteen days time was perfectly well, to his great Satisfaction.

5. Another man, much in the same manner afflicted, in the same Parts, and with
like Vehemence, as also on both sides of his Neck, was cured by bathing the
Parts afflicted with the said same Powers of Amber, Morning and Night, for some
few days rubbing the Medicine well in, for about a quarter of an hour at a
time: he was so perfectly cured that he had not so much as a Fit thereof, for
several years after.

6, After the same manner and with the same Medicament have I cured more than
forty others, that had been a long time afflicted with the Cramp, and could
meet with no Remedy; and some of them who had been so often seized therewith,
that it had brought upon them such a Debility and Weakness of the Parts, as to
render them almost wholly useless: even these, with the use of this only thing,
have I so perfectly restored (through the Blessing of God) as their Disease
never after returned: nor in the Cure of them, did I give the least of any
thing inwardly, nor use any thing outwardly except that only thing; which for
its excellency, worth, and certainty of its Operation, I could not be silent
in; but communicate (from the Giver of all good) so great a Blessing to the
World. It is indeed a most Excellent and Admirable Medicine, and as far as any
thing can be said to be certain, it may be really pronounced of this
Medicament, in the Cure of this Disease.

7. A woman in Childbed (having lain in about two days) was seized with
After-pains, and the Cramp in the middle of her Thigh: The whole Abdomen, as
also her Thigh, I caused to be bathed well with the Powers of Amber, every two
hours: This had such Effect that in a quarter of an hour after the Application
thereof, her After-pains went away, and by the Blessing of God in twenty four
hours space, she, was so perfectly freed both from Them, and the Cramp, that
they returned no more upon her.

8. And this I was willing to insert here (though out of its proper Place) for
the sakes and benefit of all women in Childbed, who labor under that great
Affliction; I have used it to a Multitude of women afflicted with After-pains,
and can speak it (in the presence of God) that I never in that Case used it in
Vain; and therefore commend the same to all Nurses, Mid-Wives, and Charitable
Gentle-women to keep by them, and have it always in a Readiness for the use of
their poor afflicted Neighbors.

9. That these After-pains are nothing but a Cramp or Convulsion of the nervous
parts of the Mesentery and Abdomen, being hurt both by overmuch straining, and
also by Cold taken in, at time of Delivery, I am fully persuaded; the Reason
and Evidence of which I may more fully prosecute in an other place: however
this is manifest, that the same Medicament which not only gives Relief, but
also cures the Cramp in other Persons, as suddenly and immediately resolves
these After-pains, in Women in Childbed; and so perfectly takes them away, as
to return no more, for that bout.

10. And I remember, I was once called to a Woman who had labored under those
pains for about seven days and nights, without any hope of Cure, (Multitudes of
things having been applied to no purpose, but the Disease rather still getting
ground upon them:) she was given up to Despair, and all about her esteemed her
to be no better than a dead Woman: when I saw her, her case was so desperate
that I could promise nothing: but I caused her to be liberally bathed over all
the Abdomen, from the Mucronata or lower part of the Sternon, to the Os Pubis
for about half an hour, with the said Powers or Amber, and her Belly to be
covered with hot clothes (...) warm as she could endure them: this was repeated
every third hour for eight or ten times, and through the Blessing of God, this
miserable Creature was saved from the jaws of Death.

XXII. Convulsions arising by Consent from Pains in the Stone.

1. This Man having been for many years afflicted with the Stone and Gravel; at
length the Pains became so exquisite as to excite Convulsion-Fits, and that in
an extreme manner, the man was of a gross or fat Body, and of a long time used
no kind of Exercise, but eat well and drank freely, and that a thick kind of
foggy Ale, which doubtless left Recremen^s enough in all the principal
Passages, from which Causes, without doubt his Disease had its Beginnings.

2. In the first place, by reason of the fullness of the Body, and the great
Repletion of humors, I thought fit to purge him, the which I did with my
Family-Pills, as being a Medicament proper and specific against the Stone it
self, and of which I have had Experience in several Persons in that Disease:
among the Rest, one Andrew Beech of New Castle, in a L^tter to me, dated 18th
of April 1682. gives this Commendation. Honored Doctor, I have sold your
Family-Pills for diverse years, and have often taken of them with good Success.
I believe under God, they have been an Instrument of my Preservation for these
three or four years last past. But of late especially, I have been troubled
with the Stone, and by taking of your Pills, I have voided many Stones, and
some of them, of a prodigious Bigness to come through a man's Yard. These are
the Gentleman's own words in his said Letter; however I have a Cloud of other
Experiments of the same kind; which enduced me at this time to their
Exhibition: I ordered him to take them every third or fourth day, by the use
thereof for six or seven times, there was not only a large Evacuation of
corrupt, putrid, and evil humors, but also a Production of several small
Stones about the Bigness of Wheat-Corns, and some of them somewhat bigger, to
the number of Twenty three.

3. In the Int^rvals of Purging, I caused the Reins of his Back, the Pubis and
Perinaeum, to be very well anointed twice a day, with the Blood red Oil of
Scorpions; and inwardly the Powers or Tinctures of Castoreum, from twenty to
forty drops, to be given in this following Wine. Take Old Rhenish Wine, two
quarts: large Onions extremely thin sliced, or spread small, six ounces: digest
forty eight hours, and keep, it for use. He took four ounces of it at a time,
Morning, Noon, and Night, with the Drops of the Powers, and sometimes of the
Tincture of Castoreum aforesaid.

4. But by reason, the Convulsions came often, and held him very strongly, we
were forced to have recourse to Opiates; amongst which I exhibited at first two
grains of my Laudanum, at bedtime, in a glass of Rhenish Wine and Sugar: this
was done four times: The fifth time I gave him three grains; and continued that
for four other Doses: the ninth Dose I gave him four grains, which I continued
for a week, and once a week increased his Dose a grain, till it came to ten
grains, the which Dose I gave him five or six weeks together: By this assiduous
use of Laudanum, not only the Pains of the Stone were mightily diminished, but
also the Convulsion-Fits were wholly abated.

5. However the more absolutely to secure our Patient against these
Convulsive-Motions; I caused him to be bathed all over, twice a day with this
following Mixture. Take Powers of Amber, Powers of Oranges, of Limons, of
Marjoram, of Sage, of Pennyroyal, of each three ounces: Powers of
Juniper Berries, of Rue, of Caraways, of Aniseed, of each three ounces: of
Rosemary, Sassafras, and of Castoreum, of each one ounce: mix them: with this
Mixture he was bathed twice a day from Head to Foot, for ten days, but more
especially the Convulsed Parts, Hereby the Genus Nervosum was mightily
comforted and refreshed, and the Cause of the Spasm in some manner discussed.

6. But as it was apparent that the Stone was the prime Cause of this
pestiferous Evil, so it was our Care to use powerful Lithontripticks, for this
purpose I ordered the four following Medicaments (all of them singular
specificks and of great Force in this Disease) to be used by Course.

7. A lithontriptick Liquor. Take Rhenish-Wine, two quarts: Hydropiper-Water, a
quart: Large Onions shred small, six ounces: Opium, two ounces: Powder of
Winter-Cherries, one ounce and half: House-Radish Root scraped, Mustard seed
bruised, Sal Prunellae, of each one ounce: Salt of Tartar, Volatile Salt of
Millepedes, of each six drams: mixed: digest twelve or fourteen days, and
express the Liquor, which keep close stopped for use, Dose two ounces.

8. A lithontriptick Powder. Take Millepedes in powder, two ounces: Egg-Shells
calcined ten days in a Potters Furnace, Winter-Cherries in fine powder, of each
an ounce and half: Sal Prunellae, Opium in subtle powder, Volatile Salt of
Hearts Horn, Volatile Sal Armoniack, Salt of Urine, of each one ounce: Salt of
Juniper Berries, one ounce: mix all in a fine Powder, and keep in a Silver Box
with a good Skrew, to keep it from the Air. Dose from a Scruple to two Scruples
Morning and Evening.

9. A lithontriptick Electuary. Take Venice Turpentine, four ounces: Opium
extracted, Extract of Liquorice, of each two ounces: Liquid Storax, Powder of
Millepedes, of Winter-Cherries, Egg-Shells calcined, Sal Prunellae, of each an
ounce: Volatile Salt of Millepedes, Oil of Juniper Berries, of each an ounce:
mix and make an Electuary; to be kept in a Box with a Skrew. Dose from a
Scruple to half a Dram, once a day in a fit Vehicle.

10. A lithontriptick Spirit. Take Rectified Spirit of Wine, three pints: Oils
of Sulphur, of Vitriol, and of Salt, of each four ounces: mix the Oils first
together; then mix them with the Spirit of Wine by little and little, till all
is put in: shake all well together; digest for three months, then distill in a
Glass Alembick or Cucurbit, with a very Gentle and Gradual fire, that the
Subtle and Volatile Spirit only may come over, leaving a thick Magma at
Bottom, of the Substance of Honey, or Consistence of a soft Extract. In this
Distillation you must be cautious your Fire be not too great, for if it be, it
will force over all the Magma or Faeces with the Spirit, and then your Labor
will be lost, and all your Work spoiled.

11. This Spirit is of most Subtle and Volatile Parts, and a specific in all
Diseases of the Brain whatsoever, as well as in Diseases of the Reins: It is a
Specific not only against the Stone, whether in the Reins or Bladder, which by
its assiduous use it radically dissolves, but most powerfully opens all
Obstructions in what part of the Body soever, cures the Cachexia, and
Chlorosis, or Green Sickness in Virgins, provokes the Terms, and facilitates
the Birth: And as there is no more powerful Remedy against the Stone and Gravel
in the Reins, Ureters and Bladder, so no more excellent thing is known for the
absolute Cure of old and inveterate Head Achs, Vertigo's, Megrims, Lethargies,
Apoplexies, Palsies, Epilepsies, Convulsions, Fits of the Mother, The Gout, and
other like Neurotick Diseases: And here, in one singular Medicine, we found a
complete Remedy for the complex Malady of this our distressed and miserable
Patient.

12. These four last Medicaments were taken alternatim, or by Course, one after
another for Variety sake, for about three Months time: at the end of that time
he only took of the Spirit, Morning Noon and Night, from twenty to forty drops,
in Beer, Ale, or Wine, as himself liked best, and he continued the use of it
for about half a year longer, at what time he found himself perfectly well and
free from all his Distempers, as well that of the Stone, as that other its
Concomitant the Convulsive Fits.

13. Now it is to be no^ed, that this man had been formerly searched by a Scotch
man, who upon the Gripe, declared, He found a large Stone, as big as a Hens egg
or bigger, whose Opinion it was (and it is the Opinion of most learned men,)
that he could not be cured without cutting: but the Dreadfulness of the
Operation making him to decline that kind of help, he endured his Misery so
long, till he fell (...) C^^vulsive-Fits by the Extremity thereof. He was above
threescore years of age, by his own Relation, but a strong lusty man, at what
time I undertook him: though I must ingeniously confess, that I was forced upon
the Trial, and undertook him without any heart or hope of Cure: but by reason
the things I exhibited gave him Ease; the sick himself encouraged me to go on,
which set me upon the study and search after such things as might most probably
do him good: I proceeded on, according as I have before related, and in about
eleven months time restored my Patient to perfect Health.

14. Now whereas he might possibly receive Benefit by all the things which were
given him; yet that which (I conceive) perfected the Cure, was this Our
Lithontriptick Spirit; which I believe did really and absolutely dissolve the
said Stone in the Bladder; not that I ever made any after-search (which I have
almost a thousand times since repented the neglect of) but beause he lived
several years after free from any of those kind of pains, or the least
obstruction or stoppage of his water. In the sixty seventh year of his Age,
being invited to a Feast, he eat too liberally of something there which pleased
him, whereby being surfeited, he fell into a vehement burning Fever, which put
a period to his days.

15. After the Cure of the aforesaid Person, I have with happy Success, used
the same Method (with very little Variation) in the Cure of several others
afflicted with Convulsions arising from Nephritick and Lithontriptick Dolors:
but as in the former, so also in them, I do attribute the Cure chiefly to the
Virtue of the aforesaid Lithontriptick and Antispasmatick or Antepileptick
Spirit, whose mighty Power and Force, and singular Excellency is not to be
explicated by me in many words, but rather requires the more serious
Contemplations of industrious Physicians, the truly legitimate Sons of Art.

XXIII. Convulsions, arising from an Ulcer in the Ventricle.

1. A young Man by too immeasurable eating of sower Limons without Sugar,
created an Ulcer in the Stomach, the which upon eating, commonly excited such
extreme Pains as put the Sick into Convulsions; which fits were often repeated,
six or seven times, in the space of four or five hours.

2. He consulted Physicians, to whom he only complained of a pain at his
Stomach, which they not conceiving to be ulcerated, gave him hot and biting
things, and such as were proper Stomaticks in a cold Cause; from whence in
stead of receiving of Benefit, the pain was extremely exasperated, and the
Convulsive fits strengthened, so that he began to despair of ever meeting with a
Cure.

3. Among the number of the rest, a certain Woman Emperick, gave him Tinctura
of Cardamoms, and grains of Paradise, drawn as she said with Cinnamon water;
but such was the event thereof, that such vehement Convulsions were excited,
that at length the Patient seemed to dye or rather swoon away, which put the
bystanders into a great amazement.

4. Upon this I was sent for, and they gave me a relation of his condition, how
that for above six months he had been afflicted with these Convulsions, and
sickness at Heart, and that many things had been tied, but all in vain; yea
rather that he was always very much the worse for every thing that was
administrated to him; and that he had even now taken a Cordial and stomatick
water (which they showed me and I tasted of it, being only the Tincture
aforesaid, which was very hot) and was fallen into this dreadful fit,
accompained with swooning away.

5. After a little consideration, and pondering the condition of the sick in my
mind, I conceived it could not be any simple disaffection of the Heart, or
matter offending the Stomach in quantity (for that some former Physicians had
given him several Vomits for the cleansing thereof:) but rather an ulceration
of the Nervous tunicle of the Ventricle; the which opinion I was the more
confirmed in, when I understood, that the beginning of his Disease was from
often and too liberal eating of sower Limons without Sugar, which possibly
might cause a Convulsion of the parts.

6. Upon this I gave him salt of Vitriol, a scruple at a time, dissolved in
fair water, and I gave it him Morning and Evening: I chose such a quantity as
might not make him Vomit, but by staying in the Stomach, might strengthen and
heal the same: moreover because I apprehended it to proceed from an acid, I
thought good to absorb the said acid humor with some kind of Alkaly; for which
purpose, I caused him to take (about ten in the morning, and at four in the
afternoon) a dram of the following powder: Take Terra sigillata, an ounce and
half: fine Bole, two drams: Pearl prepared, red Coral prepared, of each a dram:
mix and make all into a very fine powder: By the exhibition of these things the
Patient had immediate ease; and in six days time was made perfectly well.

XXIV. Convulsions accompanied with a burning Fever.

1. I conceive these Convulsions were excited through a kind of Malignity, not
from the force of the Fever, for as much as they are stired up rather from the
effects of cold than of heat: and of this kind are those Convulsions which
proceed from Poison, the biting of Serpents or other venomous Creatures, Wounds
made with poisoned weapons, and such like.

2. The Patient that labored under this affliction was a young Woman, of about
twenty years of age: The Fever was not only accompanied with extreme heat, but
also Malignity, as the Symptoms did demonstrate, she being in many parts very
full of purple spots: whatever the Fever, or its appendent symptoms might
presage, without doubt the Convulsions were evidence of danger enough, for that
they gave a signification of the hurt of the Animal spirits, without which, in
this Case the Genus Nervosum could not well suffer.

3. From the manifestation of these causes, it behoved us to be speedy in the
exhibition of proper and fit Medicaments, such as might powerfully resist the
Poison and Malignity of the Disease, as well as repress the exorbitancy of the
Fever: for this purpose, I prescribed this: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, a
dram: salt of Vipers, seven grains: mix them: and give it as a Bolus.

4. About a quarter of an hour after, I caused the Sick to take a little
Treacle-water, with which was mixed half an ounce of the Aqua Bezoartica Langij:
these things promoted a powerful Sweat, for almost eight hours. In the time of
sweating the Sick was very thirsty, for the quenching of which, I prescribed
this following Juleb: Take Wood-sorrel-water, Bawm and Angelica waters, (all
simply distilled) of each six ounces: Spirit of Angelica, two ounces; Sal
prunellae, two drams: Salt of Wormwood, half a dram: syrup of Limons, enough to
make it pleasant: mix them, and give the Sick two or three spoonfuls thereof at
a time, as occasion requires.

5. These things thus taken, had a singular good effect; for the great burning
heat was abated, and therewith the malignity: however, to secure the Sick
against any more Paroxysms of the Convulsion, I the next day caused the same
dose of the Electuary, and Volatile salt of Vipers to be again exhibited, which
produced a second Ephidrotick flood, exceeding the former, but much more
pleasant and easy: and in this I permitted the Sick to take now and then the
juice of a Sivile Orange, for her refreshment.

6. The Sweating continued between three and four hours, at which time, I
caused the Nurse to lay the Cloths thinner, and by degrees to cool her, which
was happily performed in less than an hours time: after which, to comfort and
restore her, I caused her often to take of this following mixture: Take juice
of Alkermes, two ounces: syrup of Wood Sorrel, an ounce and half: syrup of
Limons, an ounce: spirit of Saffron, Cinnamon water, of each four ounces: mix
them together: of which let the Sick take every two hours a spoonful.

7. These things thus given had so happy an effect as to take away the
malignity of the Fever, so as that no more Convulsions ^^llowed* and in less
than two days time after, the spots also wholly vanished, and by continuing the
latter Cordial, she was in four or five days time become pretty well, so as
that she could sit up, eat drink, and be pleasant with her Friends; nor
afterward did she relapse: As to her Diet during this time, it was partly
Gruel, partly Mutton-broth, Chicken broth, Mace-Ale, all boiled with
Wood Sorrel and Borrage-leaves; but she eat no kind of flesh; till after the
seventh day.

XXV. Convulsion fits happening to a Woman in Labor, or but newly delivered.

1. This Woman, by reason of her hard Labor sell into Convulsion-fits, which
after her Delivery followed her very thick, with fainting away and swooning;
insomuch as the M^dwife, and Women assisting very much dispaired of her life:
whereupon it was moved, that I should be sent for.

2. But I being sick, and not able to go, having heard a relation of the Woman's
condition, sent her the following things: I. The Powers of Amber, which I
ordered to bath withal, chiefly the Abdomen and Hypogasters, as also the
Pubis, and secret parts, and this to be exceeding well done, as also to moisten
a thin flannel in the same, and apply it hot, and so to bind her up, with warm
Linen.

3. Secondly, I prescribed my Gutae Vitae, to be taken twenty drops at a time
in a glass of Aqua Bryoniae composita, for by that means the disturbed
Archaeus, and troubled Animal spirits would be immediately at rest: this I
ordered to be taken but once or twice in all, unless, they found that the
Convulsions yet ceased not: but they gave her it Morning and Evening, for two
days space: By this she found much rest and ease, and through the use thereof,
the Convulsions left her in a very little time:

4. Moreover, by reason of the bathing of the Powers of Amber, she had either,
no After-pains or they were so inconsiderable, as not to be much taken notice
of, and vanished as it were upon their first approach; such is the admirable
ex^^^^^^y and virtue of that precious Medicaments.

5. Thirdly, To comfort and refresh her spirits, I ordered this following
mixture, to be given her, a spoonful at a time, once ever hour or two: Take
strong Cinnamon water, eight ounces: pure spirit of Saffron, four ounces:
Powers of Carraways, one ounce: syrup of the juice of Alkermes, two ounces: mix
them, to be given, as aforesaid: This mightily comforted her, and so extremely
refreshed and revived her spirits, that by the use thereof with the other
things, not only her Pain, the Convulsive motions, but also her fainting and
decay of spirit totally left her; so that the Woman quickly growing brisk and
cheerful, was restored to her perfect Health; and her weakness so much abated
that in about nine days time she arose from her Bed, and walked lustily every
day about her House.

Observations from other AUTHORS.
XXVI. Two cured of a Tetanos, by Valescus.

1. He commanded the Sick man to be held upright by four other men, which done
he poured twenty four pitchers of Water (I suppose it was warm water; upon him,
falling from his Head, upon his inferior parts.

2. This done he presently placed him before the fire, and for half an hour
anointed him well, to wit from the Neck to the lowest Vertebra of the Hips, as
also the Loins and Arms, with Vnguentum Dialthaea, Martiatum, and Agrippa, mix
with Oil of Castoreum; after which he gave the Sick a little broth of a Pullet;
and he grew well.

3. The same manner of Operation and with the same thing, he cured another of a
Tetanos: Valescus, lib. 1. cap. 21.

XXVII. A Convulsion coming from Repletion.

1. The cure of a Cunvulsion, is to be varied according to the variety of the
Convulsive cause, for that which proceeds from repletion, must be otherwise
cured, than that which is caused by Inanition: and that which proceeds of pain,
otherwise than either of them.

2. For, that which is caused by repletion, is cured by discussing and
evacuating Medicines, as by Diet conveniently appointed, by Purging, Bleeding,
digestive local Medicines, exercise, Frictions, Sulphurous baths, and other
things appointed by the prescription of some learned Physician, which shall
oversee the Cure, which may consume the superfluous and Excrementitious humors,
that possess the substance of the Nerves, and habit of the body.

3. The Topical remedies, are Oils, Ointments, and Liniments, with which the
Neck, Backbone, and all the contracted parts shall be anointed. The Oils are,
Oils of Foxes, Bays, Camomil, Worms, Turpentine, Costus, and of Castoreum.

4. The Ointments are, Vnguentum Arragon, Agrippae, de Althaea, Martiatum.

5. This may be the form of a Liniment: Take Oils of Camomil and Bays, of each,
two ounces: Oil of Foxes, one ounce: Ointments of Marshmallows and Martiatum,
of each half an ounce: Fox grease, one ounce: Aqua Vitae, an ounce and half:
Wax, quantum suffi^it: mix and make a Liniment for use. Or thus: Take Oils of
Worms, of Spike, and of Castor, of each three ounces: Man's grease, one ounce:
Sulphur vive, half an ounce: Wax, a sufficient quantity: mix and make a
Liniment. Or thus: Take Ointments of Martiatum and Agrippa, of each three
ounces: Oil of Turpentine, an ounce and half: Oil of Sage, half an ounce: Aqua
Vitae, one ounce: Wax, an ounce and half: mix and make a Liniment.

6. As to the Diet, it ought to be slender, and sudorifick, with the Decoction
of Guajacum, because by these remedies, the gross, tough, and viscous
excrements, which are in fault, are digested. Paraeus, lib. 9. cap. 10.

XXVIII. The cure of a Convulsion caused by Inanition, or emptiness.

1. A Convulsion proceeding from Inanition, is to be cured by the use of those
things which have a natural power to nourish and restore: and therefore there
ought to be prescribed a Diet consisting of Meats full of good Juice and
Nutriments, as Broths and Jellies of Capons, Piegons, Veal, and Mutton, boiling
therein Violet, and Mallow-leaves.

2. Conserves must be ordained, which may strengthen the debilitated Powers,
and humect the habit of the Body; such as are the Conserves of Bugloss,
Borrage, Violets, and Water Lillies. The following broth will be profitable:
Take Lettice, Bugloss, Purslane, of each an handful: of the four greater cold
seeds, of each half an ounce: Barberries, one dram: (half an ounce is better)
let them all be boiled with a Chicken, and let the sick take the Broth, every
Morning.

3. If thirst is vehement, the following Julep will be good: Take Rose Water,
four ounces: Violet-water, half a pint: white Sugar, four ounces: mix them, and
give it by degrees.

4. If the sick is bound in his Body, emollient and humecting Clysters are to
be exhibited, made of the Decoction of a Sheeps-head and Feet, Mallows,
Marshmallows, Pellitory of the Wall, Violet-leaves: and other things of like
nature with them: Or, that the remedy may the more speedily be made, let the
Clyster be composed only of Oil and Milk.

5. Topic remedies may be made in the form of Liniments and Baths: A Liniment
may be made after this manner: Take Oils of Violets, and sweet Almonds, of each
two ounces: Oils of Lillies, and Earthworms, of each one ounce: fresh
Hogs-lard, three ounces; new wax a sufficient quantity: mix and make a
Liniment: with which let the whole spine and part be anointed.

6. The form of an emollient and humecting Bath: Take leaves of Mallows,
Althaea, Parietary, of each six handfuls: seeds of Time, and Fenugreek, of each
half a pound: boil them in spring water a sufficient quantity, adding at the
end Oil of Lillys, nine ounces: make a bath: into which let the sick eater,
whilst it is moderately warm.

7. When he shall come forth of the Bath* let him be dried with warm Cloths, or
rest in his Bed, avoiding Sweat: But if the sick is able to undergo the charge,
it will be good to order a bath of Milk, or Oil alone, or of them equally mixed
together: Paraeus, lib. 9. cap. 10.

XXIX. The cure of a Convulsion by Sympathy and Pain, as by the puncture of a
Nerve, bite of a venomous Beast, etc.

1. A Convulsion which is caused both by consent of pain, and communication of
the affect, is cured by remedies which are contrary to the Dolorifick cause. If
it proceeds from a Puncture, or venomious bite, the wound must be dilated and
enlarged by cutting the Skin, that so the venenate matter may flow forth the
more freely, for which purpose also Medicines, which are of a thin, and l^quid
c^nsistence, but of a dry and digestive faculty, are to be poured in, to call
forth and dissolve the Virulency.

2. Of this kind, are Venice Treacle, and Mithridate, which may be dissolved in
Aqua Vitae, with a little of some Mercurial Powder, for this is a noble
Antidote, and admirable Alexipharmacum: Also Cupping-glasses and Scarifications
will be good.

3. The condition also of all Dolorifick causes is to be opposed by the
application of contrary Remedies; as, if pain by reason of a pricked Nerve or
Tendon, shall cause a Convulsion, it must presently be resisted by proper
Remedies: as Oils of Turpentine, or Euphorbium, mixed with Aquae Vitae; and also
with other remedies appropriated to the punctures of the Nerves.

4. If the Pain proceeds from excess of cold, because cold is hurtful to the
Brain, the spinal Marrow, and the Nerves, the sick shall be placed in a hot
Air, such as that of a Hot-house or Stove: all the spine of his Back and
convulsed parts, must be anointed with the hot Liniments above mentioned; for
that is much better than to expose the Patient suddenly to a very hot fire or
warm Bath.

5. In the mean time the Chyrurgian ought to take diligent heed, that as soon
as the signs of the Convulsion to come, or at hand, or already present, do show
themselves, that he put a stick, or some other wooden thing between the
Patients Teeth, left they be fast locked up, by the pertinacious contraction of
the Jaws; for many in such a Case have bit off their Tongues.

6. For this purpose he ought to be provided of an Instrument called Speculum
Oris, which may be dilated and contracted, according to your mind, by means of
a Screw. Paraeus, lib. 9. cap. 11.

XXX. A Convulsion in a young Man.

1. A Young Man had a Convulsion, so that he could not bend his Backbone; by
help of this following Medicament he could presently walk nimbly.

2. Take of rank Butter and old Lard, of each three ounces: Bdellum,
Ammoniacum, of each half an ounce: Myrrh, Castoreum, of each three draws:
Flowers of Staechas and Rosemary, of each one pugil: Nutmegs and Cloves, of
each one dram: a young Kitling or little Cat unbowelled, and striped, and cut
in pieces: stop the Belly of a Goose with these things, and sew it up and roast
it on a Spit, and the first Liquor that drops, cast away, the next save in a
Dripping-Pan, half full of Vinegar, to anoint the cramped or convulsed Back.
This is a divine Medicine. Riverius, lib. 4. observe. 308.

XXXI. A rare kind of Convulsion.

1. A certain Soldier, by a Bullet out of a piece of Ordnance, was wounded in
his right Arm, the Bullet took his whole Arm away, only that part next his
Shoulder was left, as much as four Fingers breadth.

2. His Arm being cured and the wound perfectly healed up, he was took with a
kind of Couvulsion, which drew his Head backwards, toward the right Side; and
it frequently agitated his Jaws; so that he was fain to have linen Cloth
always between his Teeth, which ever and anon he was wont to bite and grind
with his Teeth.

3. He called many Consultations of Physicians and Chyrurgians; who were all of
opinion; That in the extremity of the bone, which was taken away by the Bullet,
that there was some sharp Point which pricked some Nerve, and caused this
Convulsion; and that therefore the extremity of the bone must be again opened,
and diligently made smooth and even.

4. This work being diligently performed did no good, but the Patient was vexed
after the same manner, which took from him all hope of Cure.

5. By good Fortune I met him, and he told me his Trouble; it came into my
Mind, that some hidden Venom of the Pox; might peradventure cause this
accident; And I asked him presently; whether or no, when he was wounded he had
the Pocky Disease upon him, or whether he ever had any; to which he answered,
that a little before he was wounded; he had been troubled with a grievious
Gonorrhaea, which notwithstanding had been perfectly cure^^^.

6. This increased my Conjecture; so that I advised the Patient to try such
Medicines as are given against the Pox; whereunto being very desirous of help,
he willingly submitted, premising first universal Purgation and a sudorifick
Diet-Drink.

7. I rubbed him with mercurial Ointments; by which he was fluxed; and after
the third day of his fluxing was over, those Contractions and Convulsions
ceased, and he was never troubled with them again. Riverius Lib. 4. Obs. 468.

XXXII. Convulsions in a Child.

1. A Gentleman's Child, of ten years of age, was taken with such epileptick
Convulsions, that all the parts of his Body were dreadfully shaken, and the
Fits returned ever and anon, and there was well near no Intermission.

2. In so great a danger, and so importunate a disease; I gave him half a dram
of Salt of Vitriol dissolved in Betony-water; whereby Vomiting was presently
raised, and the Patient voided much Phlegm, and immediately the Convulsions were
stoped.

3. Yet they returned after some hours, but were much shorter and lighter; and
therefore a Purgation was given him of Diacarthamum, half an ounce: Syrup of
Roses, one ounce: with Betony-water, and this was given about the Evening,
because in the Morning he had his Fits. He was purged well in the Night.

4. Afterward there was given to him Oil of Amber and Spirit of Vitriol, of
each five drops, in Betony-water: his Fits were more light, but the night
following they were somewhat more frequent.

5. The next day in the morning we gave him a Potion of Carduus-water, of
Scordium-water, of Treacle-water of Bauderon, of each one ounce: of Salt of
Carduus, one scruple: Confectio Alkernes, one dram: by help whereof all
Convulsions were taken away.

6. But least they should return Bezoardicum Joviale, was twice given him, the
quantity of twelve grains in eight hours time: we gave him the Alexipharmical
Potion, and the Bezoardicum Joviale, because there was great suspicion of
Malignity in the Disease, and because the Boy had fifteen days before been
troubled with a Quinzy, which Disease was then very epidemical in that City of
Nemours, especial afflicting Children.

7. Whence we may conjecture that the Malignity remaining after the Disease in
the Body of the Child, during the time aforesaid, was suddenly awakened and
raised those Convulsions. Riverius Obser. 650.

XXXIII. Convulsions in an ancient Man.

1. One of the Senators of Lauginga being about sixty four years old, was taken
with the Convulsion, called Tenatos: he could not stir his Neck, he could not
becken with his Head, nor turn it backwards, or to either hand, but it was
drawn both ways at once with Pain, so as to be held upright: he could not lie
along, but sat upright night and day, bending a little forward.

2. This good man was by the Grace of God in four days time cured of this
Disease, by these following Inventions. Take syrup of Sena, three ounces: this
he drank and was well purged after it.

3. In the Morning he took of my sneezing Powder, the making whereof is set
down.

4. After Purging he used the Morning t^^ vulgar sweating Bath; after he had
used this, his whole Neck in the Evening was rubbed with hot Clothes;
especially near his Body.

5. It was afterward anointed with Line-seed Oil; and folded and wrapped in
hot linen Clothes; which being done; in the space of four days he was cured,
Martinus Rulandus, Cent, 3. Cure 85.

XXXIV. Convulsions with loss of Memory, and a bad Sight, to which a heavy
Sleep or Caros was antecedent.

1. One, aged fifty, living idly in Pleasure, presently after he was married,
arising in the Morning, went into the Tavern to write somewhat, and found an
Heavin^ss of head, with a Megrim, so strong that he could scarce return home,
but being there he was amazed, and goin to sit down, he fell, his Eyes turned,
and he faltered in his speech, and vom^ted abundance of Phlegm.

2. Some thought it to be an Apoplexy, but when I come and saw that he moved
both sides, I denied it be to so; and because he was astonished only, sat and
with his Eyes shut, and Phlegm came forth at his Mouth and Nose; and he was
without a Fever, I concluded, that it was a Caros and not a Lethargy.

3. And presently the same day, because he endeavored to vomit, I gave him this
following Vomit: Take Syrup of Vinegar, Oxymel, Oil of sweet Almonds, of each
one ounce: Water of Nuts and Radishes, of each two ounces: he took it and
vomited much Phlegm.

4. His Temples were anointed with this, Take Oil of Nutmegs by expression, one
dram and half: Oil of Sage and Marjoram, of each three drops.

5. After this, when he was in bed, I advised a Clyster; which his Wife
refused, therefore I gave this Suppository: Take Honey, as much as will make
two Suppositories: boil it, and add Salt, a dram: Pellitory-Roots, and Troches
of Alhandal, of each half a dram: make two Suppositories: give one presently,
the other at night.

^. (...) I commanded a Feather dipped in this Juice to be put into the Nostrils:
Take Juice of Rue and Marjoram, of each two drams: Castor, half a Scruple:
Vinegar, a dram: mix them: He did this often.

7. This ointment was for his back, that the matter might be removed from the
head, not fearing it should fall upon the Nerves immediately descending from
the Brain; rather choosing a Palsy should follow, than an Apoplexy; being
desperate and ready to fall into it: thus, Take Oil of Castor, Euphorbium, and
of Pepper, of each two drams: Oil of Costus, half an ounce with Wax make a
Liniment.

8. Because he slept continually, they yielded to this Clyster, and he was
insensible to refuse it: Take Orris-Roots green, two ounces: Elecampane,
Angelica, of each half an ounce: Galangal, Sage, Rue, Betony, Origanum, of each
a handful: Rosemary, Stechas, Prim rose flowers, of each a pugil: Bay Berries,
half an ounce: Rocket and Mustard seed, of each two drams: Fennel seed, three
drams: Agarick, half an ounce: Spurge-roots, two drams: Bran, a Pugil: make a
Decoction; and in a pint of the straining, dissolve Juice of Rue, half an
ounce: Juice of Mercury, an ounce: Benedicta Laxativa, Hiera Logadii, of each
two drams: Castor, and Troches of Alhandal, of each half a dram: Honey of
Rosemary-flowers, Oil of Rue, of each an ounce: Sal Gem, a dram: make a Clyster.

9. One day he had a Glyster, another a Suppository; they moved him, otherwise,
he always stepped; except he was raised, and then he took Broth down, when poured
into his mouth, and nothing else.

10. I had applied a Vesicatory to his Neck, but his Wife would not yield to
it, therefore I fixed six Cupping-Glasses to his Neck, Shoulders, and Back,
with Scarification.

11. His Back was still anointed and he had this Water in a Spoon: Take Water
of Lilly Convally, Rosemary, Cinnamon, of each one ounce: the Powder
Pleresarchonticon, Dianthos, of each half a dram: Castor, half a scruple: Oil
of Marjoram, two drops.

12. A few days after, when he could swallow better, to move the matter from
the head (I ordered this:) Take Lozenges of Diacarthamum of my praescription,
two drams: Diagredium, six grains: Syrup of Roses solutive, an ounce: with
Cinnamon Water, make a Potion: he took it, but knew not whether it was Physic
or Broth.

13. Being thus purged, he began to be less sleepy, and to take things better,
and to know the Standers-by; therefore I purged him again, thus: Take
Orris-roots, half an ounce: Angelica, Master-Wort, Galangal, of each two drams:
Marjoram, Sage, Spike, Betony, of each an handful: Rosemary, and
Staechas-flowers, of each a pugil: Fennel-seed, two drams: Carraway, a dram:
Senna, an ounce and half: Carthamus seeds, an ounce: boil and in a pint
strained being hot, infuse Turbith, three drams: Agarick, half an ounce:
Ginger, a dram: Sal Gem, half a dram: let them stand a night, strain and
dissolve Sugar, for three Doses, with two drams of Cinnamon: He drank it three
days, and was well purged.

14. I applied this Cap to his Head: Take Orris, Angelica-roots, of each two
drams: Marjoram, Rosemary, Staechas-flowers, and Lavender, of each a dram:
Coriander-seeds, half a dram: Nutmegs, two drams: Storax, three drams: make a
Powder to be quilted in a Nightcap.

15. After purging when he could open his Mouth, he took this Gargle: Take
Pellitory-roots, an ounce: Angelica, half an ounce: green Orris-roots, two
ounces: Staphis acre, two drams; Sage, Rosemary, of each an handful: Nutmegs,
three drams: Cloves, two drams: Pepper, half a dram, boil them in Wine.

16. He eat in the Morning a Lozeng of Dianthos, with a drop of Oil of
Cinnamon: and sometimes this, Take Species-Dianthos, Diagalangal,
Pleresarchontic, of each half a dram: Cinnamon, two drams: with Sugar make a
Powder.

17. When all things were better, and he could set up, I purged him with these
Pills: Take Pill Cocheae and Aureae, of each a scruple: with Sage-Water, make
Pills.

18. These purged well and all things abated; but while all hoped well, he
suddenly fell into Convulsions, but though others feared, I told him, They were
not so dangerous or deadly, for the matter fell upon the Nerves; and being
sharp, caused a Convulsion rather then a Palsy.

19. Another Physician was sent for, because I was to go out of town, and we
applied this to his Pulses: Take Rose Water, two ounces: Vinegar, half an
ounce: Cloves, half a dram: Species Cordiales, a dram: Clouts were wet therein
and applied.

20. Also he had this Julep: Take Julep of Roses, an ounce and half:
Cinnamon Water, an ounce: Borage, Bugloss, Peony and Lilly Convally-Water,
Epileptick-Water compound, of each half an ounce: M^nus Christi, six drams: He
took it often.

21. He had another Fit but he still used the Julep, and purged again by the
Physicians order; in my absence; and had things against the Epilepsy, and his
Convulsions came no more.

22. Four weeks after the Disease began, at my return, he walked well, eat, and
slept, but he complained of decay of memory and ill sight, that he saw things
double, and could not read.

23. I advised thus: a Wine; Take Sage Marjoram, Betony, Wormwood, of each two
drams: Senna, an ounce: Agarick, three drams: Ginger, a dram: Annis and
Fennel-seed, of each two drams: Nutmegs, a dram: Orris-roof, half an ounce:
Galangal, two drams: beat them for a quart of Wine and Betony-Water, three
ounces: let him drink it three Mornings.

24. Secondly, Pills: Take Pill. Cochiae, Faetidae, of each half a dram: with
Sage-Water make Pills.

25. Thirdly, a Powder: Take Coriander-seed, Fennel, Annis, Caraway-Consits, of
each three drams: Marjoram, half a dram: Juniper Berries, twenty: Cinnamon,
half an ounce: Diagalangal, a dram: with Sugar of Roses, make a Powder; let him
take it sometimes in the Morning, and somtim^ in the Evening.

26. Fourthly, an Infusion: Take Aqua Vitae, two ounces and half: Cinnamon
Water, an ounce: Sage and Rosemary-Water, of each half an ounce: Ginger,
Pepper, Cloves, Cubebs, of each half a dram: Confectio Anacardines, a dram:
infuse them hot, strain it; he took a spoonful often in the Morning.

27. Fifthly, he washed his Eyes in the Morning, with this: Take Fennel-Water,
three ounces: Rue and Eyebright, of each two ounces: Rose Water, an ounce:
white Wine, half an ounce: thus he was cured, and his Disease never returned.

XXXV. A convulsive Palpitation.

1. A worthy Matron, about the age of forty years, which had many Children, and
yet had her Courses two years since, after a Jaundice, felt an involuntary
attraction on her left Cheek, which drawed both Lips and Nose, and somt^mes the
lower Eye-brow on that side, often coming and twiching, but her Mouth was not
much awry, as in a perfect Convulsion of the Mouth when it is drawn aside.

2. All her Face was pustl'd and red, to these two Infirmities she desired
Application, and came to me with a great Retinue: I called it a Convulsive
Palpitation, as I showed in my Golden Practice.

3. It must be cured least a Convulsion follow or Palsy, especially when a
numness in the Arm or Leg went before.

4. First, general Evacuation by Praeparatives, Purges, and Bleeding, being she
was Plethorick; and after that Alteratives and proper specifical Remedies.

5. Topics outwardly to the Cheeks; first this Masticatory: Take Nutmegs, two
drams: Pellitory, Angelica, Staves-acre, Mustard seed, of each a dram,
Angelica-seed, half a dram: Cubebs, a scruple: Pepper, half a scruple: Mastick,
a dram and half with Wax: make Forms to be chewd fasting.

6. Then let her hold this water in her Mouth warm, especially on the left
side: Take Pellitory, Angelica, Acorus, Orrice, of each two d^ams: Sage,
Marjoram, Time, Ground Pine, Origanum, of each two drams: flowers of Lavender,
and Staechas, of each a dram: Nutmegs, Cinnamon, of each an ounce: Fennel, and
Carraway-seeds, of each a dram: Rocket-seeds, two drams: powder and add Sack
five pints: distill them.

7. A pillow to lay to the Cheek warm, or to sleep upon: Take Orrice-roots, six
drams: Elecampane, Angelica, of each half an ounce: Sage, Betony, Ground Pine,
flowers of Melilot, Cammomil, Elder, Roses and Lavender, of each a dram:
Coriander-seeds, two drams: Gromwel-seeds, an ounce: Carraway, and Fennel seed,
of each a dram: Salt, an ounce: beat them and quilt them in a Pillow.

8. For her red Face with pustles, let her often lay on this Milk, with a
Pencil: Take Straw-berries, not ripe, a pint and half: Goats-milk, four pints:
green Dock roots, three ounces: green Purslain, Plantane, of each a handful:
red Roses, three pugils: four whites of Eggs, Limons, or Oranges sliced, six;
Alum, half an ounce: Vinegar, an ounce: Camphir, a dram: distill them.

9. Take Litharge, an ounce: Ceruse, two drams: Borax, a dram: add Vinegar,
four ounces: infuse them; mix a little water with these, and with this anoint
the Face: And if any white remain, wash it off in the Morning, with the water
mentioned.

10. Apply two Cupping-glasses to the Neck, two to the Shoulders, on each side
one, and do the same a month after, let the Issue under her Ear, be closed,
because it was troublesome: I ordered a good Diet, and a decent use of other
things, called non-Naturals. Platerus, lib. 1. page. 137.

XXXVI. A Convulsion happening to a Woman in Childbed.

1. A Woman in Childbed, which often had been brought to bed, eight days after
Travel, about Noon, was taken with Shivering, and fell into Convulsions.

2. When I came, she was come to her self, but was astonished, and did not well
distinguish things, and by her Pulse, she had a strong Fever.

3. I prescribed these following things: Take Peonys-seeds, a dram: and bruise
them, and make an Emulsion, with an ounce of Julep of Roses and Peony-water, an
ounce.

4. Then, Take Julep of Rose Water, an ounce and half: Peony-water, an ounce:
small Cinnamon Water, half an ounce: let her take it two Mornings.

5. The third day, the Fit came at the said hour, and Convulsions followed;
these ceasing, and the heat increasing, I gave boiled Water, and Syrup of
Violets and Limons: And this following Electuary: Take Conserve of
Peony-flowers, Bugloss, Violets, Marjoram, Roses, of each half an ounce:
Peony-seeds husked, a dram: syrup of Currants, two drams: with syrup of Violets,
make an Electuary: Let her take it in the Morning, and drink her Julep of
Peony-water.

6. The third day, which was the first of January, it came at the same time,
with Convulsions, and great weakness and l^ss of strength, the Julep was
repeated, and her Back and Neck anointed with Oil of sweet Almonds.

7. Because it was two days absent, we doubted it was a Quartan.

8. And because she was very Melancholic, the third day, there was but some
signs of a Fever, but a great pain in the Hip and in the right Groin, for
which I gave her this Julep: Take syrup of Violets, Juleps of Roses, of each
half an ounce: syrup of Poppies, two drams: Bugloss-water, an ounce and half:
Cinnamon water, a dram: she slept well, sweat little, and the pain returned
again at Evening; and her Urine was wholly stopped.

9. Therefore, I ordered the part affected to be anointed with two ounces of
Aqua Vitae, with a dram of Camphir dissolved in it, the pain abated by it, but
the part itched, and was hot.

10. To provoke Urine, she drank Broth made of Pease, a pugil: Asparagus and
Parsley-roots, of each an ounce: Melon-seeds, half an ounce: add Butter: at
Night she urin'd freely; in which was much filthy, stinking, white slimy matter.

11. The day following, she took an ounce and half of Manna in broth, she
purged and made Urine freely.

12. But the pain in her Hip returned, and the Convulsions were feared,
therefore she took this draught: Take syrup of Limons, half an ounce: syrup of
Poppies, two drams: Rose and Peony-water, of each half an ounce:
Cinnamon Water, a dram.

13. Outwardly was applied, Sage-water, two ounces: Aqua Vitae, an ounce and
half: Camphir, Opium, of each half a dram: with clothes to the part.

14. Now the pain went from the Hip, to all the Leg, and the Veins were broken
in the thickest part of the Thigh without, and they were so painful, that they
might not be touched.

15. Hence I gathered, that there was sanguine and foul melancholic Matter,
that had first caused the Fever, Convulsion and Melancholy, and pain in the
great Veins and Groins, fallen down.

16. And because she had a pain at Heart, and fainting from the pain, that they
thought Death was at the door, being consumed and wanted Milk for her Child, I
ordered the Stomach to be anointed with Oil of Nutmegs, and to Take Julep of
Roses, an ounce and half: Cinnamon Water, half an ounce: She took it often, and
good Broths, but she refused all things else.

17. To the Varices or broken Veins, this Cerot was applied: Take Populeon, two
ounces: Mucilage of Fleabane, Thyme and Faenugreek-seed, of each one ounce and
half: Oil of Camomil and Bean flower, of each two ounces: with Wax, make a
Cerot: She kept it not long, because she could endure nothing to touch her
there.

18. I would have made Derivation of the humor by opening a Vein in the Foot,
but she was foolish and nice, and would not.

19. Therefore she had three Cupping Glasses with Fire applied to the Calves of
the Legs; after she had held her Feet a while in the Decoction of
Camomil-flowers, and Sage in Lie and Wine, by this she had great ease, and
therefore the next day the same was done the third time, by which the pain so
abated, that she could fit, stand, and afterward walk, but a long while
limping.

20. While these Diseases lasted, there came another, that almost killed her,
and her Urine was totally stopped for four days.

21. I gave her these Pills: Take Turpentine, a dram: with Liquorish and
Sugar Candy, and Winter-cherry-stones, half a dram: and Diagredium, four
grains: she purged so that she was weaker, and but once made water, half of
which settled at the bottom like unto slimy matter.

22. After that, I gave this potion: Take Water-cress seed, half a dram:
Pelitory-water, an ounce: Julep of Violets, half an ounce: she drank it, and
the decoction of Pease, mentioned before: and then there was voided abundance
of thick Urine, as before, and after that she never felt any hurt in making of
water; so that in the space of a month she was cured by degrees. Platerus, lib.

XXXVII. A Convulsion in a young Woman.

1. My only Daughter, was v^xed with Tortura oris, or the Convulsion of the
Mouth, and was happily cured, as follows.

2. First, I exhibited these Pills: Take pil. Chochiae and Aureae, of each one
dram: make ten Pills. She took five the first day, which gave her seven stools;
the next day, with the other five, she had five stools.

3. I fomented the parts with Venice Treacle and Aqua Vitae; to the Neck was
used this following Ointment: Take Vnguentum, Martiatum the greater, one ounce:
Oil of Bays, Petrolaeum, Castoreum and Turpentine, of each half a dram: Oil of
Bricks, half a dram: mix them.

4. By this she had great advantage, her Courses being obstructed, thus I

Agarick, of each one scruple and half: make a mass: she took of this five pills
in the morning, of the bigness of Pease; they gave eight stools.

the Neck.

8. In the beginning of April, she went to London, and returning homewards the
22 of the said month, she caught Cold, and fell into the said Distemper, on the
contrary side of the Face.

grieviously afflicted with it, yet by the Blessing of God, she was cured in
sixteen days, as follows.

Pills: She took them when she went to Bed, the same night, her Neck was
anointed with Oil of Sassafras.

11. In the Morning, I gave half a dram of pil. Ruffi, and again used the said

Myrrh, Nutmegs, Saffron, of each one scruple: Oil of Rue, of Bays, Petroleum,
Turpentine, of each two drams: Vnguentum Martiatum, half an ounce: Oil of
Costus, of Pepper, of each one dram: mix them.

13. But first the Neck was fomented with Aqua Vitae, in which was infused
Nutmegs, Cinnamon, Cloves, Pepper.

14. She eat Nutmegs often: to the Nostrils and top of the Head was used the
Oil of Amber.

15. She chewed on the found side, of Pellitory of Spain, and was often purged
with the following Pills: Take pil. Fetidae, one scruple: Castoreum pulverised,
half a scruple: pil. Ruffi and of Amber, of each one scruple: make pil. number
five. And thus was she restored.

16. In the same year she was afflicted with an erratick Fever: sometimes she
was hot, and by and by sweating, again cold, all in the space of half an hour;
and thus she was often vexed in a day.

17. Thus I purged her: Take the roots of Parsley, Fennel, of each half an
handful: Elder-bark, two handfuls: Vulgar Orris roots, of Madder, of each one
handful: Sparagus roots, two handfuls: boil them in a sufficient quantity of

abundantly in the eleventh year of her age; but now they were stoped, upon
which she felt a light Convulsion in the right Eye, as though her Eye was
pulled inward, but presently it would be gone, afterward both Eyes did suffer
with great Pain of the Head.

called the compound water of Briony: dose three spoonfulls, by Intervals as she

XLI. A Convulsion, with flux of the Hemorrhoides, Fever, etc.

1. Thou, O Lord, which have the power of Life and Death, and drawest from the
gates of Death; I confess without any Act or counsel of Man, but only from thy
goodness and Clemency, thou have saved me from the bitter and grievious
symptoms of a deadly Fever, beyond the Expectation of all about me.

2. Restoaring Me, as it were, from the very Jaws of Death, to former Health,
for which I praise thy name, O most Merciful God, and Father of our Lord Jesus

September, 29. I was much debilitated which art immoderate flux of the
Hemorrhodes; yet, daily was I necessiated to go to several places to Patients.

4. A hardness being contracted by riding, the flux was stayed for fourteen
days; after that, I fell into a most cruel torture of my Teeth, and then into a
deadly burning Fever, which then raged very much, killing almost, all that it
did Infect.

5. For which I used the following method, which by the help of God succeeded,
first, I purged, thus: Take Rhubarb infused, one dram: (it was infused in three
ounces of some proper water:) syrup of Diaireos, one ounce: Electuary of juice
of Roses, three drams: these gave four stools.

6. Afterward, I used decoction of Hartshorn, and so the Disease was almost
cast out by Urine, it flowed vrey much for four days space, that I was not only
much emaciated, but also weakened, so that I could not move my self in my Bed
without help.

7. I also had Convulsion of the Mouth and Eyes, then was a Pigeon-cut open
alive, and applied to my Feet, to draw down the Vapors: For I was often
afflicted with a light Dilirium.

8. Then my Wife sent for two Physicians; I had used a Clyster with Emollient
herbs and an Electuary Diacatholicon and Lenitivum; the Physicians my Friends,
prescribed the following, of which I swallowed the quantity of a Nutmeg, twice
a day: Take Electuary of Gems hot, two drams: Species Plerisarconticon, one

them.

13. I was again thus purged: Take syrup of Diairees, one ounce and half:
Electuary of the juice of Roses, three drams: Cichory water, a sufficient
quantity.

14. It is to be obsserved, before the Physicians came, there were drawn seven
ounces of Blood from the Liver-Vein, and three days after were Leaches applied
to the Hemorrhoides, and thence removed ten ounces.

15. After which, I took the decoction of Hartshorn, thus I was pretty well
able to take Meat: Then I used Chalybiate wine with juice of Scurvy Grass, and
syrup of Sceletyrbia Foresti, and purged once a week with Pulvis Sanctus; syrup
of Diaireos, and infusion of Rhubarb.

16. For the pain of the Teeth, I used Oleum Ligni Heraclei. After I was
troubled with Itching in the Scrotum, which was cured with our decoction of
Sarsa, with Antiscorbutick herbs: And so I became perfectly well, praised be
God, Hall, upon English bodies, Cent. 2. Observe. 60.

XLII. A Convulsion in a young Woman.

1. The Daughter of Alderman Smith, aged about twenty two; from diminution of
her Courses and fear, fell into ths Mother, with Convulsion of the Eyes, and
darkness of sight, it continuing all the Fit, together with distortion of the
Neck, and palpitation of the Heart, as also a Fever, so that she tossed up and
down in her Bed.

2. In the time of her fit, I commanded to distill into her Mouth, three
spoonfuls of Hysteric water, afterward I fumed her with Vngula Caballina,
which delivered her from her fit.

3. To prevent the fit, was given as follows: Take Castoreum pulverised, half
a dram: pil. Faetidae, one dram: make seven Pills gilded: this purged her
well, and delivered her from the symptoms.

4. Lastly: Take powder of Castoreum, half a dram: Extractum Hystericum, one
dram: make nine Pills; of these she took three at bed time, and two in the
Morning, by these few remedies she was perfectly cured, and never had it after.

fruitlessly used: Take the Decoction of Briony, with Vterin herbs, half a
pound: Species Hierapicra, two drams: Holand powder, one dram: make a Clyster;
this injected, gave two stools with success.

3. I gave her Hysterick-water, n w called Bryony-water, one ounce: which she
vomiting up, I presently exhibited the followi^g: Take Extractum Hystericum,

4. About half an hour after she had taken them, she vomited them up with some
Phlegm and acid melancholy, complaining of great heat of her Stomach, as if it
were excoriated.

5. I presently commanded she should drink half a pint of clear cold water,
which she presently cast up; it was reiterated, and as soon as it was hot in
her Stomach, she cast it up again; it was again repeated, and then she retained
it with ease.

6. For her Convulsion: Take Vnguentum Martiatum, half an ounce: Oils of

XLIV. A Convulsion in a Child: advised by Dr. Willis, 21. June 1666.

1. For the right Honorable the Lord Robert Brooks his Son, afflicted with
Convulsion-fits, these following things were ordered: first, Blister his Neck
well, give him of the following powder as much as will lie on a twopence, in a
spoonful of the Julep, repeating it every six or eight hours; after it, give a
spoonful more of the same; let him have of M^lk and Sugar every day; keep him

6. In case the Child should have fits again, give the powder a double
quantity, and repeat every eight hours, and give it spirit of Hartshorn, twice
in twenty-four hours; one or two drops.

7. At the first appearance of any fit raise a Blister in his Neck, and whilst
he continues indisposed, give him a Clyster every day, and all that time, let
the Nurse be kept to a diet of Gruel, Panado, and thin Broth, boil in them a
bundle of sweet Herbs, viz. Rosemary, Thime, Winter-savory, and Sweet-Marjoram.

8. Let the following Bag be worn about the Child's Neck, and worn constantly,
so that it may ly on the mouth of the Stomach: Take Elks claws, roots of male
Peony, and its seeds, of each half a dram: make a powder, and put it into a
Sarsenet-bagg.

9. Other directions for the same Child; let a Nurse be got that has new Milk,
and let the Child suck her three or four days.

10. If you see him still subject to fits, and to be heavy and oppressed in the
spirits, apply a Leech to each Jugular Vein, take away an ounce of Blood from
each side, be careful to stop it presently, for it will be apt to bleed very
much.

11. Apply the following Cataplasm to the Feet, renew it Morning and Night, lay
them on warm: Take Rue, four handfuls: Misleto, if to be had, half an handful:
stamp them very well in a mortar, add to it Bay Salt, half an handful: and as

with Sugar Candy; If he begin to loath his Medicine, leave them off for a
while, and take only the powder and Julep, at the New and Full Moon.

16. Let the Nurse (instead of him) take the distilled water Morning and Night;
six or seven spoonfuls; in the first spoonful let her take as much of the next
powder as will lie on a shilling, and the rest after.

17. Take seed of Anis, Caraway, sweet Fennel, of each one ounce: male-Peony
roots, six drams: Liquorish, two drams: Sugar Candy, one ounce: make a powder,
or else make the powder into an Electuary with Lohoch Sanum and Expertum, and

before nor after. Hall, upon English bodies, Cons. 59.

XLV. A Ccnvulsion arising from green Choler.

1. A certain Student, lean and spare bodied, because he pined his Body with
watchings, fell into an Itching of his whole Body with burning, and felt a
biting heat in the region of his Liver.

2. After two months he was shaken with a direful Convulsion, which was
accompanied with a swooning, coldness of his Hands and Feet, small Pulse,
heart-burning, desperation, Convulsion of the Jaws, shortness of Breath,
distortion of Eyes, a notable grinding of his Teeth, all which were joined with
a vain endeavor to Vomit, and argued either that he had taken Poison, or that
he had a worm in his Entrals.

3. Wherefore he drank store of Oil blood-warm, by help whereof he vomited
abundance of eruginous or Verdigreece colored Choler, with exceeding great
straining, and so was freed from his present oppression; after two months were
over, his fiery Liver, being habitually distempered and apt to breed a like
humor, raised the same, yea, a more dreadful tragedy.

4. For he raved three whole days together, was speechless, and vomiting up the
same kind of humor, by help of Milk he was freed from his fit.

5. The original of this Malady was (...) into; and it was the unanimous,
opinion of all the Physicians, That it did proceed from a hot distemper of his
Liver, which bred this pernicious and venomous humor.

6. Remedies are provided (...) strengthen the Liver, and withal to temper the
dryness and assuage the Inflammation thereof; a cooling diet and a due order is
prescribed in all the six non-natural things.

7. Cooling potions are given him to drink, and like Medicaments ate outwardly
applied. Baths of fresh water are enjoined; whey is given qualified with store
of cooling simples.

8. A Vein is opened in the upper and lower part. An Issue is made in his Leg,
Leeches are frequently applied to the hemorrhoidal Veins.

9. Lastly; nothing is left unattempted, but all in vain: For every, month the
Convulsion returned, attended with cruel symptoms.

10. In conclusion, this Lion-like Disease was conquered by Blood-letting,
celebarated in the Salvatella vein of the right Hand, which being sparingly
practiced every month, he was perfectly cured of his Convulsion. Zacutus
Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 40.

XLVI. A Convulsion in a Infant.

1. An Infant, its former Nurse being dead, did suck the Milk of another,
whereupon his whole Body was defiled with many Ulcers; Physicians being advised
with, said the Milk of this second Nurse was exceeding good, because the Woman
had all the signs and qualifications of a good Nurse.

2. I being sent for, was of a contrary mind, because she had her Courses: For
this blood being moved, provokes Lust, troubles the Body, heats the humors,
pollutes the pure Blood, which is to make Milk, and when the Blood flows in its
monthly Course, the Milk is abated, because the substance of the Milk and the
Courses are one and the same.

3. For this cause, ugly colors, loathing of Meats, vomitings, looseness of the
Belly, slight Fevers pustles upon the skin, and Ulcers arise: since by the
mixture of most filthy Blood, collected for the monthly evacuation, the other
Blood which was provided before for the Infants Nourishment, does contract such
a pollution, that it puts on the nature of Poison rather than of Nutriment.

4. Hence Infants have their Epilepsies, Convulsions, shortness of breath,
leanness and other grievous maladies, since from the Womb to the Dugs, there is
a very great intercourse and sympathy: These things being propounded, in
consultation, the other Physicians, recanted their former Judgment and ascented
to me.

5. Then was the Infant delivered to another Nurse that was not menstruous, by
her to be suckled; hence it came to pass, that for a month together, the Infant
having used this new Milk became fatter, and the Ulcers being dried and covered
with Scars, it grew more goodly and recovered its former habit of Body. Zacutus
Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 118.

XLVII. A Convulsion arising from Worms.

1. Trincavallus, a most substantial Author, relates, That he had seen Children
so troubled with the Worms, that they were convulsed backwards, so that their
Heels did almost touch their Heads.

2. When I first read this Authors experiment, I exceedingly wondered at it,
hardly believing that the Legs could be so far bowed backwards as to touch the
Head; when being once called to cure the Son of a certain Goldsmiths; I find
him taken with this kind of Convulsion, which was accompanied with shaking,
Anxiety, and a mighty Belly-ach at fits.

3. I was amazed at the strangeness of the Example, suspecting that he was
poisoned; I gave him Treacle; returning home, I presently called to mind the
story of Trincavallus.

4. Anon after I went to see the Patient, I made him a Clyster of Milk and
Sugar, and after that, I gave him a Clyster of Milk Aloes, and the juice of
Garlic.

5. I gave him six Pills of a dram of Aloes, and a scruple of Dittamnus: with
half a scruple of Treacle; being hereby sufficiently purged, he was never the
better.

6. The next day following, I caused him to take three Pills made of
Snake-Wood, Aloes, Myrrh, with Juice of Wormwood and Mints, and the Gall of a
Bull.

7. After he had taken them, he saints away, and being griped, he voided with
his Dung two black round Worms, and beyond hope recovered of this grievous
Malady. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib. 2. Observe. 34.

XLVIII. A Convulsion happening in Wintertime.

1. An exceeding bold Dutchman in the middle of Winter went into the River,
contrary to the advice of his Friends, and stayed therein half an hour, after
he came out; his yard was so writhen, and distended by way of Convulsion, that
as often as he made water he pist in h^s own Face, unless he held his Hands at
his Navel to keep the Urine off.

2. This Disease arising from an external Cause; viz the Coldness of the Water,
was in a months time cured without any Remedies respecting the whole Body.

3. For after a Fomentation made of a Decoction of Betony, Rue, Sage, Bazil,
Peny-royal, Calamints, Staechas and Rosemary, and a Liniment made of Oil of
Aniseeds, of Turpentine, Earthworms, of Foxes, Castoreum, Rue, with Aqua vitae
and strong Wine, his yard by little and little returned to its former
Condition. Zacut. Lusitan. Prax. admir. Lib. 3. Obser. 114.

XLIX. A Convulsion in a young man from drinking Wine.

1. I shall recount a prety-conceited, but yet a mortal, Story: being sent for
some years ago, to visit a Master of a Tavern or Inn, as I alighted from my
horse, two Scholars came and met me, very ingenious Persons both; they knowing
me, were ready enough to speak, yea very talkative; but being benumed in their
Legs, elevated in their Mind, not able to speak plain, like Fools and Madmen,
they gave a Bowl full Wine to my Footboy to drink.

2. This being done, one of them being in a Chair, made this merry Discourse,
for he was well seen in Humanity: said, Wine is the sweet Milk of Venus, so
faith Apuleius in his Golden Ass; it is the Milk of old men, as Avicencia
says; if is a rare Help for such as are sad, melancholic, and fly the Company
of Men, for it cheers the Heart of man, according to the Scripture; and since
it is exceeding like unto our Nature, it quickly breeds brisk Spirits, with the
scarcity whereof those that are troubled, they are wont to be sad and
melancholic.

3. Wherefore without the Help of the Caballine Fountain and the double topped
or forked Parnassus, only by the Assistance of Bacchus, I am suddenly become a
Poet, and having drunk off his Cup, thus he sung: WHen Wine I drink, all Cares
do sleep,
No Harm I think naught makes me weep.
Then drink we Wine, sweet Blood of Grapes,
Let Us cease to whine, and joy, like Apes.


4. The other being excellently read in Philosophy, envying his Companion the
Poet, began thus to speak: Many Commodities attend himi that loves Wine; for
Wine strengthens the Body, helps the Digestion, and Distribution of the Humors
moves Urine and Sweat, breeds Blood, purifies the Spirits, cherishes and
refreshes them, is of a very speedy Nutriment, tempers, the Humor, makes men
confident, provokes the innate or inbred Heat, causes Fruitfulness in Women, is
very like unto us, and friendly to Nature, repairing our decayed Forces,
tempering the Labors of old men, the only Help against cold Diseases, it
causes Sleep, breaks the Acrimony of bitter Choler, drives away Sorrow, makes
the Mind cheerful, resists all Poison, according to the Mind of all Authors.

5. Lastly, there is no Meat so sweet, because it serves both for Food and
Physic: For it exceedingly helps swooning Persons, and feeble; in a word, it
makes the Faculties, almost dead, to revive again, especially since with
moderate though not with obscure Sweetness, it sends from it self a most
fragrant Odor; wherefore prize Wine for its admirable Effects: and for that
every four-footed Creature is extremely delighted therewith, also Serpents
themselves: Swine, Crows, Bears, Apes, Elephants, when Occasion is offered do
exceedingly covet Wine, as Pliny tells us, Lib. 10. Cap. 72.

6. Whereupon having taken off his Cup, thus he begane to sing with an audible
and clear Voice: WIne in my Crown, all Cares does drown:
I am rich and wise, in mine own Eyes, and Kings despise:
When Sprights of Wine, themselves in twine
With my sweet Spirit, then I inherit
Great Craesus's Wealth; Wit, Valor, Health,
And All is mine, by Force of Wine.


7. I being tired out with so many words, suddenly getting out of their hands,
who all this while kept me a Prisoner, going up the stairs, I visited my
Patient, and enquiring more particularly concerning his Condition, I spent
about half an hour; coming down and devising h^^ to depart from that place
without, being seen again by them; I find my Students as it were buried in
Wine; I feel their Pulses, in one I and one; in the other a very obscure one;
the former stepped his last Sleep; the latter being taken with a Convulsion, many
things being applied, with much ado recovered.

8. Wherefore true it is that of Hippocrates and Galen, that from Drunkenness
proceeds Speechlessness, Convulsion, Apoplexy, Palsy, dead Sleeps,
Stupefactions, Falling Sickness, and other mortal Maladies; but these are not
the Faults of Wine simply considered, but of over much Wine. Zacutus Lusitanus,
Lib. 3. Obser, 122.

L. A Convulsion in a middle-aged Woman.

1, The Wife of a certain Countryman, about the age of forty, was afflicted
with a grievous Convulsion of the hands, together with an intolerable pain in
the rest of the Joints; yet without any Cramp.

2. There was also the beginning of an Epilepsy; and her Urine was pale and
muddy; for which Causes, the cure was thus instituted by me: Take of the water
of Tile-flowers, six oun^^^. of Senna laxative, one dram and half: mix them.

3. As for drink let it be Sage and Hysop-Wine; the third day, after Purgation
she did wash in a Decoction of Cammomil, Juniper Berries, Mugwort; these things
being administered she grew perfectly well within a few days. Martinus Rulandus,
Cur. 21. Cent. 7.

LI. A Convulsion in a middle-aged Man.

1. A noble Polander, about the Age of thirty, was miserably afflicted with a
Convulsion only in one Arm, Hand, and the Fingers of that Hand; my Counsel was
desired toward the subduing of this Distemper.

2. I, becuse he did affirm he was sound in all other parts, and did appear
also to be so, did repel or remove this Disease in three weeks time, by the
following Bath and Ointment.

3. Take Mallows, Lillies, Daffodil, of each six ounces: Sage-Leaves, three
handfuls: Wormwood, Origanum, of each two handfuls: Flowers of Cammomil,
Melilot, and Stechas, of each two handfuls and a half: Line-seed, Faenugreek of
each one pound; Boil them all in a sufficient quantity of water for a Bath; in
which he is to fit before and after Noon.

4. After he has used the Bath, let the Neck, Backbone, and all the Places
afflicted with the Cramp be anointed with this Ointment: Take Oil of Violets,
three ounces: of Lillies, two ounces: of sweet Almonds, of Mastick, of Roses,
of each one ounce: mix them for an Ointment: By these two Remedies only (no
other being tried) he recovered his former Health. Martinus Rulandus, Cur. 85.
Cent. 8.

LII. A Convulsion in a Man grown into years:

1. A certain Husbandman, above four and fifty years of age, did suffer, under
one of his Knees, a Retorsion and Contraction, with a pain of the Nerves;
insomuch that he was lame and could not stretch out his Foot; he contracted all
these Evils by a kick of a Horse; but within a very short while he was cured
by the following Medicines, thus prepared.

2. Take the Flowers of Cammomil, Sage, and Juniper Berries, of each ten
handfuls: they were boiled in a sufficient quantity of water for a Bath: and he
sat therein Morning and Evening.

3. After the Bath, the affected Ham under the Knee was well anointed with this
Ointment: Take grease of a Badger and of a Fox, of each three ounces: Oil of
Mastick, two ounces: Oil of Spike, one ounce: Vinegar, three drams: over a fire
they were well: mixed for an Ointment; by the use of which he could, in the
space of ten days, stretch out his Knee, Leg, and Foot, and could either stand
or walk as he pleased. Rulandus, Cur. 92. Cent. 8.

LIII. A Convulsion of the Hands.

1. A certain Nun had a Contraction of the Nerves of her Hands, which within a
few days I restored by the following things: Take for a Purge, the Pounder of
Senna laxative, one ounce; Sugar, one ounce: the distilled Water of Carduus
Benedictus, one pound and half: they were macerated a whole night in a warm
place for an Infusion; which being thrice strained, was taken in the Morning,
and two hours before Supper.

2. Take for a sweating-Bath, Rue, Wormwood, Pennyroyal, Hore-bound, Marjoram,
Origanum, Sage, Calamint, Hyssop, Centaury the lesser, of each three handfuls:
Juniper Berries, five handfuls: Flowers of Camomil, four handfuls: Sulphur, one
ounce: Salt, three ounces: let them be mixed and boiled in a strong Lie, as
much as is fit; in which Stones red hot is to be put: This sick Sister did use
the same Morning and Evening.

3. After Evening, bathing, the convulsed hands were anointed with the
following Ointment; Take Foxes grease, four ounces: Badgers grease, two ounces:
Mastick, three drams: Euphorbium, two drams: Pepper of both sorts, seven drams:
choice Wine, one pound and half: make a Decoction to the Consumption of the
Wine; these things presently did her good, and made her a sound and healthful
Virgin, Rulandus, Cur. 54. Cent. 10.

LIVE. A Covulsion in a young noble Woman.

1. A noble Woman, about the age of thirty, of tender Constitution and lean in
Body; was every Winter wont to be afflicted miserably with a Catarrh or Rheum,
flowing upon the Windpipe and Lung, with a hoarse Cough and great Spitting,
but the last year, great Care and Diligence being used, she was quit of that
Evil.

2. After the Winter-solstice, having taken Cold, she was troubled with a great
pain of the Head, a tingling of the Ears, giddiness, and a defluction also upon
the Eyes, by which it did easily appear, that the Heap of Serum, which was wont
before this time to distill into the Breast, was now wholly laid up within the
Head and Brain.

3. Besides, an Effect of which was, that as often as she began to sleep she
was exceedingly infested with Passions which seemed Hysterical, to which she
never had been obnoxious: For when she was sleepy and closed her Eyes,
presently a Bulk ascending in her Belly, a Choking in her Throat, Tremblings
and Leapings about the Praecordia, were stirred up; which Affections
notwithstanding quite ceased, when she was thoroughly awakened, so that the sick
Party was necessitated to abstain, almost altogether, for many days and nights,
from Sleep.

4. Being sent for to this Lady, after she had been sick and weak for many
days, I was compelled at length to use gentle Medicines: therefore I took care,
that Blood should forthwith be drawn from her Foot to four ounces, and every
day a Clyster of Milk and Sugar to be administered, by which she was wont to
have three or four stools.

5. Besides, I gave her every eighth hour a Dose of the Spirit of Hearts horn,
in a spoonful of the following Julep: Take of the Waters of Pennyroyal, of
Walnuts, and Black Cherries, of each three ounces: of Hysterical Water, two
ounces: of the Syrup of Clove-gisly-flowers, one ounce and half: of Castor tied
in a little Knot and hanged in the middle of the Glass, half a dram: of the
Powder of Pearls one scruple: mingle it.

6. I caused with Success a Vesicatory to be put behind the Ears, and a
Cataplasm, of the Leaves of Rue and Cuckowpint, with the roots of Briony,
Bay Salt, and black Soap, to be laid to the Soals of her Feet.

7. Sometimes I gave her in the Evening, in a little draught of the praescribed
Julep, half an ounce of a Diacodium, to which succeeded a moderate Sleep,
without the wonted following Convulsions; which kind of Effects, from Opiats
exhibited in the like Case, I have often experimented.

8. For the quenching her thirst, gave her a Ptisan, with diuretic Ingredients
boiled in it: by the use of these she was very much eased in a short time; but
that which proved a great Benefit to her, was, that an Impostume in her Ear,
breaking of its own accord, poured forth at first a yellow matter; and
afterward, for many days, great plenty of thin Ichor or Excrement, by which
Evacuation, the Convulsions of the Viscera and Praecordia wholly ceasing, the
Disease was pefectly cured.

9. As to the reason of the aforesaid Sickness, without doubt it seems that
these Distempers were excited by the serous Colluvies, laid up within the
bounds of the head: For the transl^tion of that humor into the head brought at
first both the Disease, and the Secretion or Flowing of it out through the
Emunctories of the Ear, took away all the Symptoms. Besides, when the morbifick
Matter had brought into the Spirits, planted about the beginnings of the
Nerves, a Disposition somewhat explosive, they, though being struck as it were
with a Madness, were continually troubled, yet so long as leaping back toward
the Brain, they obtained a space, in which they might be more freely expanded
or stretched forth, they did indeed only more vehemently exercise the Phantasy,
and without farther trouble did only cause Watchings.

10. But when by Sleep, sometimes creeping upon her, the Excursion of the
unquiet Spirits were restrained toward the Brain, (which indeed necessarily
happens, when we sleep, the nervous Liquor within the Pores of the Brain, at
that time being plentifully admitted) they tumultuously rushing upon the heads
of the wandering Pair and intercostal Nerves, troubled the whole Series of
Spirits, flowing within the Passages of these Nerves, and so caused the
aforesaid Convu^sions about the Praecordia, Viscera, and Muscles of the Throat.

11. I have known many both Men and Women sick after this manner, who when they
have been troubled with an Headache, an Heaviness of the hinder part of the
head, or a Vertigo, have, while they slept, felt forthwith in their
Praecordia, or Viscera, or both together, Perturbations as it were convulsive,
which indeed happens from the bending downward of the tumultuating Spirits,
being reflected from the Brain, upon the beginnings of the Nerves.

12. But that the use of Opiats brought a pleasing sleep to this sick person,
without the wonted Convulsions following, the reason was because the Animal
spirits, as unquiet and furious as they were, yet by the intanglement of the
narcotick Particles, they were bound as it were in chains, that afterward,
without any resistance they were overcome by sleep. I have indeed very often
happily cured most grievous fits of Convulsions, both Asthmatical, and as it
were Hysterical, by administering Opiats. Willis on Convulsive diseases, cap. 5.
Observe. 1.

LV. A Convulsion in a young Maiden.

1. A Maid about the sixteenth year of her age, falling from her horse upon a
stone, grievously hurt her left Breast, from whence a tumor arose with pain,
which symptoms, notwithstanding by the use of Medicines, at the beginning
seemed to be mitigated, and to be indifferently well, for a long time after.

2. Three years after she having taken cold, and having observed but a bad
course of diet, all things began to be exasperated, the hurt part swelling into
a bigger bulk troubled her with an acute, and almost continual pain, that the
sick Virgin, for the cruel torment, could take no rest for many days and
nights, neither could she suffer the Glandula's of her Breast, being then made
more tumid, to be either touched or handled; nor any noise, or shaking to be
made in the chamber.

3. When they had applied fomentations to this tumor which was likely to
degenerate into a Cancer; and Cataplasms of Hemlock and Mandrakes and other
stupifying and repercussing things, this Gentlewoman began to suffer certain
Convulsive affections, which freqently infested her.

4. At first, as often as the pain in her Breast did cruelly torment her, she
felt in that place prickings, Convulsions, and contractions, running about here
and there: then presently her Ventricle and Hypochondria, and often the whole
Abdomen, were wont to be inflated and very much distented, with an endeavor of
belching and vomiting.

5. By and by the same distemper, being leasurely translated to the superior
parts, excited ^nsensibility: to which shortly after, convulsive motions
succeeded in the whole body, and that so strongly that the sick party could
scarce be held by three or four strong men.

6. These kind of fits were at first wandering and only occasionally excited,
they would come as often as the pain of her Breast was excited by some manifest
cause: afterward these Convulsions did more often infest her, and at last
became habitual, and periodical, twice in a day, to wit, they were wont to come
again constantly at so many set hours after eating.

7. And when after this manner the sick person had been miserably afflicted for
six months, she began at length to be troubled and molested with a Vertiginous
Distemper of the Head, exercising her almost continually; for which malady,
when a fomentation of Aromatic and Cephalic herbs had been a good while
administered to her Head; she became better as to the giddiness, but then she
was perpetually infested with a new and admirable symptom, viz. an empty cough,
without spitting night or day, unless when she was overwhelmed with sleep.

8. After this worthy Virgin had tried without much benefit, diverse Medicines
and remedies, prescribed by several Physicians, she was at last helped by
making use of the most temperate Bath at the Bath, then being presently
married, after she had conceived and was brought to bed, she grew well by
degrees.

9. If the reasons of the whole Disease and its accidents be enquired into,
without doubt the convulsive distemper, was first of all excited from the tumor
or pained place of the Breast; the cause of which was, partly the most sharp
sense of Pain, being impressed from its fibers and nervous parts, and partly
from the Heterogeneus Copula, being affixed on the spirits inhabiting those
fibers and Nerves.

10. For truly it may be suspected, that the most sharp humor impacted in the
tumor, which perhaps had in some sort flowed thither, by the passages of the
Nerves, being repercussed, by the use of Topics, had entered the fibers and
nervous filaments, or little strings disposed thorough the whole border or
neighborhood, and so the Heterogeneous, and Explosive Copula, had struck upon
the spirits; for the shaking off of which, as often as by Pain they were
excited, they entered into convulsive explosions, and together with them, other
Spirits flowing within the neighboring Nerves, by consent of the forms, (as it
often happens) were exploded after the same manner.

11. Then the convulsive distemper, when it first had begun in the extremities
of the Nerves, being continued through their passages, even to the Head, was
wont to cause the insensibleness and from thence leaping back upon the whole
nervous system, the convulsive motions, of the limbs and all the members were
excited.

12. The fits about the beginning of the sickness being excited after this
manner; By reason of Pain, from the distempered part, were carried secondarily
to the Brain and its appendix: But afterward when the spirits inhabiting those
places, being often explosed, by sympathy, had so loosened and weakened the
Pores of the containing parts, that there lay open a passage within the same
for all Heterogeneous particles to enter, with the Nervous juice, the
convulsive Procatarxis or more remote cause, also increased in the Head.

13. And the spirits inhabiting the Encephalon, being infected with an
Heterogenous Copula, they themselves begun the convulsive fit, or at least
afforded the first instinct to its assault, which did return for the most part
at such set hours after eating, because the morbifick matter was carried in,
together with the nervous juice, almost in an equal dimension.

14. In truth, in such cases, where the Convulsion being general does possess
almost all the parts of the whole Nervous system successively, we may suspect,
that the animal spirits, had contracted an Heterogenous and expulsive Copula,
in the whole nervous stock, which when it is risen, at the set time, to a
fullness, incites the spirits themselves at the appointed time in like manner
to explosions, and the same explosion being begun some where, is propagated in
order to all after the manner of a fiery enkindling.

15. As to that empty Cough, which succeeding the fomentation of the Head,
exercised this sick person almost incessantly for many months, it seems that
this symptom should depend altogether from the nervous origin being
distempered, and not at all on the st^ffing of the Lungs, for she did not avoid
any thing with the Cough.

16. And, if at any time that force of Coughing was violently restrained,
presently she was troubled with the sense of choking in her Throat: so that it
is very likely, the morbifick matter laid up near the nervous origin, being
rarifyed and stirred by the fomentation, entered more deeply into the heads of
the Nerves, appointed for the Lungs, and stirred up in their fibers, and
filaments, perpetual Convulsions, after the like manner as when the nervous
juice, which waters the fibers and tendons of the Muscles, being made sharp and
degenerate, induces to those parts continual leapings and contractions.

17. Hence when a Convulsion or spasm was stopped, in some branches of the
distempered Nerves, so as she could not Cough, presently the convulsive motion
running into other branches of the same neighboring Nerve, stirred up that
choking in the Throat: I will here propose another example of a Convulsion,
arising from the extremitys of the Nerves being affected. Willis, de morbis
convulsivis, cap. 6. Observe. 1.

LVI. A Convulsion in an ancient Gentlewoman.

1. A noble matron, of fifty years of age, after her Courses for about half a
year had left her, she began to complain of a pricking pain in her left pap,
then afterward that distemper leaving her, she was ill about the Ventricle,
for there arose a hard and schirrous tumor with a sad pain.

2. Upon this came an inflation of the Stomach with difficulty of Respiration,
a nauseousness and frequent vomiting, then the Disease increasing, with a more
sharp pain running about here and there she fell into convulsive distempers of
the Ventricle.

3. In that place she was almost continually afflicted with Convulsions
variously running about, just as if her Ventricle had been torn in pieces,
besides a constant perturbation of mind with thirst and watchings, and frequent
deliquium of spirits and as if she had been just dying; all which symptoms she
plainly perceived to arise from that tumor in her Ventricle.

4. They saw that all vomitory, cathartical, antiscorbutical and Hysterical
Medicines did her no good, but were rather hurtful and troublesome: she received
some benefit by letting Blood by Leehes, and by the use of Asses-milk: And by
the long drinking of Spaw-waters she was much eased.

5. The aforesaid symptoms, which commonly are ascribed to the Hysterical
passion, and the vapors from the Womb, here plainly appear, to have proceeded
from a tumor, arising about the bottom of the Ventricle.

6. For that the Blood of this Gentlewoman, being very hot and Melancholic,
when it could be no more purged by her Courses flowing from her, it laid up its
recrements, and adust faeculencies, at first in her Breast, and then from a new
beginning in the membranes of her Stomach, from the tumor there made, sharp and
heterogeneous particles falling down perpetually, entered the fibers and Nerves,
plan^ed round about, which cleaving continually to the spirits, dwelling in and
flowing into those parts, excited them to frequent explosions, and so made
convulsive distempers, in all the neigbouring parts.

7. But the convulsive motions sometimes were more light in that place, hence it
appears that the whole nervous stock and the Head it self (as is wont to be in
greater Convulsions) had not as yet been touched, with the same distemper, but
the disorder of the spirits arising about the parts affected, and from thence
tranferr'd by a smaller undulation or waving to the Head, and so only lightly
disturbing the spirits, inhabiting it, induced watchings, with a great heat,
and perturbation of the phantasy.

8. What we have hitherto discoursed of Convulsions, from the morbifick settling
upon either end of the nervous system, will more clearly appear, when we shall
hereafter treat particularly of these chief kinds of Convulsions; viz. the
Hysterical, Hypochondriacal and other passions.

9. In the mean time, there will be no need to add a curatory method for this
Hypothesis of Convulsions, arising by reason of the extremities of the Nerves
being affected, because the ways of curing may be better accomodated, to the
passions of this kind, hereafter particularly to be spoken of.

10. But for the present it behooves us to proceed to the unsolding of the
convulsive passions; whose cause or morbisick matter seems to subsist within
the nervous unfoldings.

11. We have largely enough in another place discoursed of the nervous
foldings, and in their description and use, we have shown that it is very
likely the more grievous fits of convulsive motions, beginning oftentimes within
these parts, are from thence propagated on every side, into the neighboring
parts, and not seldom to a great distance.

12. At least that it seems much more probable, that the Heterogenous and
Explosive particles, after that they have overcome the tract of the Head and
its medullary appendix, and being more deeply slidden into the channels of the
Nerves, and their passages, together with the juice watering them, do spread
their stores within the nervous foldings, as it were in crosse-streets, and
bypath, and there sometimes make their statio^s, until at length, being more
plentifully heaped, they as it were with collected forces, produce the more
cruel convulsive Distempers.

13. This I say, appears to be much more probable, than what is commonly said
to suppose them vapors, arising from the Womb, Spleen Ventricle, or any other
inward part, on which all the fault is easily thrown.

14. For within these soldings, there are spaces large enough for morbifick
mines, that the matter may be there at leisure laid up and remain, till it be
gathered to a full^ess.

15. But then because we believe, that great plenty of spirits lodge there more
than in any other little Cells, the Heterogenous Copula growing to them lays
as it were tinder for more grievous explosions, so that the spirits being
explosed within these Bod^es, do not only inflate and dilate them, but elevate
and lift them up from their place, even as an house blown up with Gun-pouder,
wherefore the parts lying over them, are suddenly lifted up into a tumor, and
being loose are drawn violently hither and thither.

16. That after this manner the more cruel fits of Convulsions about the
Praecordia and Viscera are often stirred up, I have found to be true, besides
the arguments taken from reason, not long since by my own sight.

17. For, when I oppened the dead Body of a Gentlewoman, who had been
exceedingly troubled with (as they say) fits of the Mother, or Hysterical
distempers, I found the Womb wholly faultless, but the Nerves near the foldings
of the Mensentery, as it seemed, only to be lifted up, and elevated to a bulk,
and the membrans of that appeared torn and loosened one from another, as being
on every side tumid and loose, as it were blown up into little bubbles, or
bladders. Willis, de morbis convulsivis, cap. 6. Observe. 2.

LVII. A Convulsion in a Gentlewoman.

1. There are more considerations of solid reasons, whereby we are induced to
believe, that the passions called Hysterical do most often arise, from the
convulsive matter, heaped up within the Mesenterick enfoldings, and by turns
explosed: which shall be more clearly manifested where we especially treat of
those Diseases.

2. But neither is it less probable, that the Colic pains do very often
proceed from a more sharp and irritative matter, contained in the same
enfoldings.

3. Besides as the convulsive fits seem to begin from the Spleen, or Ventricle,
by reason the beginings of which are Inflations, and very great disturbances of
those parts, so it is likely that the nest of the convulsive matter, was hid
within the nervous enfoldings, belonging to the Spleen or Ventricle.

4. Also this kind of matter, seems to excite within the Cardiack foldings,
most heavy tremblings, and passions of the Heart; and within the Pneumonic or
Cervical enfoldings, those belonging to the Lungs and Throat, most terrible
fits of the Asthma.

5. In our Treatise of the Nerves, we have related a notable case, of a worthy
Gentlewoman, in whom a serous matter wonted to distill from the forepart of her
Head thorough her left Nostril, falling down behind her Ear; where when the
most cruel pain did infest her, Convulsions also and admirable contractions
followed, whereby the Jointing or compaction, now of the Brain and the whole
Head, seemed to be pulled downward; now the Throat, praecordia and viscera
upwards.

6. Which kind of Convulsions, vexing the parts so opposite, and at such
distance, by turns, when they did proceed from one and the same seat of the
Disease, planted in the midst, it will be obvious to conceive. That the
grieved place, as the origin of either convulsive affection, was the
Ganglioform enfoldings, planted near the Parotidae, or the two chief arteries
of the Throat: into which the Nerves both of the wandering pair descending from
the Head, are entered, and out of which the shoots do stretch themselves, into
the Muscles of the Throat, and Branching into the Praecordia, and Vicera.

7. Further, from the same cause, to wit, the convulsive matter, heaped and by
turns explosed within the Ganglioform enfoldings, we think, and not
undeservedly that sense of choking in the Throat, so often excited in the
convulsive fits, did proceed.

8. But there will be a more fit place to speak of this, when we shall
particularly handle the convulsive disease, and symptoms: we shall now
endeavor to scarch into what remains of the last kind of Convulsions, of which
we made mention above; to wit, which relies on the nervous liquor being
infected, through its whole mass, with Heterogenious and Explosive particles:
and for that reason irritating the whole processes of the Nerves, and the
nervous bodies, into universal Spasms or Couvulsions; and those either continual
or intermitting. Willis, de morbis Convulsivis. cap. 6. Observe. 3.

VIII. A Convulsion proceeding from a Fever.

1. This distemper in this Maid being accompanied with a frequent humid Cough
was at first thought to be only a Cold: but within few days, this Cough plainly
became convulsive: so that whilst she coughed, the Diaphragma being carried
upward and with a renewed Sistole, held so long a time that she made a great
noise as if about to be suffocated.

2. Then this little Maid, growing more apparently feverish, complained of
thirst and heat, and lay all Night without sleep, with a mighty agitation of
her Body, and began to talk idly, as if her Coat had fallen into the water; and
when all things grew worse, she began to be tormented with convulsive motions,
first in her Limbs, by and by in her Face, and then in her whole Body:

3. The Paroxysms coming by often turns, twice or thrice in an hour, did most
grievously trouble her, so that this little wretch within the space of twenty
four hours, after the convulsive distempers began to grow more grievous, her
Animal spirits being almost quite spent, she dyed.

4. Whilst the convulsive fits tormented her, her Pulse was very much
disordered and often intermitting, also a frequent vomiting molested her.

5. Being sent for to visit this Maid, also too late, a little before her
Death; when I could contribute nothing to the prolonging of Life, I endeavored
what I could, to find out from her death the knowledge of the aforesaid Disease.

6. Therefore having procured leave to dissect her Body, the reasons and marks
of the symptoms chiefly urging in this Fever, more clearly appeared.

7. Opening therefore first the lower Belly, I found all the Bowels in it sound
enough, and well furnished: the Ventricle although tried with empty vomiting,
contained nothing besides the liquour lately taken in at the Mouth: For neither
in it, nor in its Appendix were Worms or sharp humors found, which are wont
oftentimes to give Cause to these kind of Convulsions.

8. The small Guts, were in many places mutually involved: to wit, the Unequal
superficies of one part, was thrust into the Concave of another, as into a
sheath; and hid far in it, which indeed I judge to have happened, wholly from
the convulsive Motions of those Bowels.

9. For whilst by reason of the vehement Convulsion excited from the nervous
Origin, the opposite Fibers being drawn together, did work the same Intestine
into contrary Motions; it easily happened that one part of the Intestine of the
Ilion being carried upwards, might run into the hollowness of the other, being
snatched downward.

10, The Thorax being opened, the Flesh of the Lungs appeared very red, and as
it were sprinkled with Blood, yea in some places, as if it were livid and
almost black, out of the same wherever it was cut there flowed a thin and
frothy Matter.

11. Certainly this showed, that the feverish Matter, or the serous Impurities
of the boiling Blood, being soon impacted in the Lungs, do so stuff up their
Pores and Passages, that the Blood it self being in its wonted and free
Circulation there stagnated, and being extravasated did excite a certain
Inflammation.

12. We found no less clear Track of this so deadly Disease in the head: For
the Shell of the Skull being removed, presently the Vessels creeping through
the Miningae, were seen to swell very much with Blood, as if almost the whole
mass of Blood were gathered together in the head.

13. For the Veins being cut or broken, about the inwards of the lower and
middle Belly, little Blood flowed forth: Besides those Membranes which cloth
the Cerebel, and being higher spread, divide it from the Brain, being sprinkled
in very many places with extravasated Blood, were noted to be of a black-purple
Color; that it was not to be doubted, but the Phlegosis or Inflammation round
about excited was the cause of so cruel infesting Convulsions.

14, These Coverings being taken away, the Substance of the Brain was seen to
be altogether moist and waterish about measure with a watery humor: yea its
R^ad or Bark being taken off, all the Ventricles were full of a limpid or clear
Water, of which kind of very clear Liquor, there was judged to be more than
half a pint.

15. From these Appearances, the Pathology of the aforesaid Fever is collected
easi^y: to wit, in this Sickness as also in many others, the Blood feaverishly
growing hot, presently deposes its Recrements, both into the Lungs and into the
Brain:

16. Wherefore a serous Colluvies, or watery Heap, did presently overflow the
Constitution of either; then because the Blood being hindered, both here and
there, from its due Circulation, it began to grow into a very great Heap, about
the Confines of the affected Parts, and at length to stagnate, and to cause as
it were a Phlegosis or Inflammation.

17. Hence by reason of the Serum being plentifully heaped up in the Lungs, and
baked by the Heat, (the troublesome Cough, with the thick and discolored
Spittle for the most part) came in this Disease, and by reason of the like
Affection, excited within the Head the Vertigo, Swimming, Stupefaction and
other cephalic Passions, constantly seized on the sick.

18. Which kind of Distempers in this little Maid, and in her Brother, by
reason of the infirm Constitution of the Brain, before in either of them, being
made more grievious terminated in an Apoplexy.

19. I might easily here propose many other Histories of persons of this Fever
at that time; but from these now recited, the type of the aforesaid Disease,
may be sufficiently known.

20. But, because the same Fever happens almost every year on some
predisposed; and perhaps, by reason of an evil Constitution of the year, may
hereafter at some time become Epidemical, it will be worth the while to
represent some Method about its Cure.

21. Concerning which, first of all take notice, That in this Fever no
Critical days were to be observed, as in the vulgar continual Fevers: For the
Blood as soon as it began to grow hot, poured out a part of the morbifick
matter (as yet crude and not overcome, from its Embraces) to the Head or Breast.

22. Wherefore, it were vain to expect that the Blood should suffer the
Heterogenous Particles to be heaped together in its mass to a fullness, that
from thence a flowring or putting forth arising, at the set Intervals of time,
it might thrust the same subtilties out of doors.

23. Yea, rather this growing hot glows not with a great and open burning; but
like a Fire covered over with Chips, sends forth a moist smoke or breath,
rather than a Flame: But so that from thence, by reason of the nervous juice,
being depraved soon in its disposition, and not rarely, because of the Lungs
being stuffed with the consumptive matter, the convulsive or phthisical or
consumptive Symptoms did molest chiefly in the whole Course of the Disease.

24. It behooves us to design the curative Intentions, according to the various
times of the Disease, and the diversities of the Symptoms, chiefly urging.

25. About the beginning of this Fever, the taking away of Blood, seemed
convenient almost to all: this kind of Remedy, I often experienced with
success, in little Children; for that by the means, as it were another
breathing place is opened to the mass of Blood, silently and covertly growing
hot, and obtruding its foot and smoke on the more noble parts; and for that
reason its impure efflorescencies or puttings forth, are drawn away from the
Brain and Lungs.

26. Therefore, although this Fever of an ill condition, may be accounted as
it were malignant; yet for as much, as the Blood is not presently apt to be
coagulated, but to be too much powered forth, and to restore its serosities on
the nobler parts, to wit, the Brain and Lungs; therefore Phlebotomy, if it be
administered in the beginning of the Disease, is convenient almost to all.

27. For the same Reason, Cathartick Medicines, and chiefly Vomitory, are
administered at the very beginning of the Disease; for these do not only
evacuate the Viscera of Crudities, and so draw away the chief somenting of the
Disease, and as it were its original, but besides, they draw forth the
serosities from the Blood, and so effect its cleansing, rather in the Stomach
and Intestines, than in the Head and Lungs.

28. Further by Emeticks, for that the receiving Glandules of the Lymphaducts,
are pulled with a great shaking, the superfluities of the nervous juice, least
they should evilly affect the Brain, and its dependencies, are expressed forth
into the lower Bowels: also for this end, the Belly is to be kept continually
loose, by the use of Clysters.

29. But in the mean time, whilst the Blood being infected with the taint of
this Disease, threatens the Brain or Praecordia with the evil, it will not be
safe to attempt any thing Diaphoreticks, or sweating Medicines, or Diuretics,
or such as evacuate by Urine, or with Catharticks, vomiting or purging
Medicines.

30. For these kind of Medicines, for as much, as they greatly pour out the
Blood and compel its Serosities into more open Issuings forth, all the
Recrements being apt to fall away from the mass of the Blood, are easily
obtruded on the Brain or Lungs, when they are of a more feeble Constitution.

31. So in a person (in another place mentioned,) loss of speech came upon the
raising of an untimely Sweat: also I have known that Sudorificks, no other than
Chalybeats, in the morbid disposition of the Lungs, have brought on a wasting
or Consumption.

32. Phlebotomy therefore, and if need be Vomiting and Purging, either one, or
other, or both, being to be made use of at the very beginning of the Disease,
the other intention shall be to draw away the morbifick Serosities of the
Blood, apt to flow forth on the Head or Breast, and to derive them gently by
other ways of evacuation, and to put them forth out of doors.

33. To this end, Vesicatories or Blistering Plasters, ought to be applied to
the nape of the Neck, or Parotidae, or Jugular Arteries, or to the Armpits, or
to the Groin, or about the Thighs, or Calves of the Legs, sometimes in this
part, sometimes in that, to wit, That the little Ulcers, being here and there
excited, and continually run^^ng, might plentifully pour forth the Serum,
imbued with the morbid and heterogeneous Particles.

34. But Remedies gently carrying the Serum into Reins and urinary Passages,
are most often administered with success: For this business, diuretical Apozems
and Juleps, are to be ordained after the following forms:

35. Take of the roots of Scorzonera, Chervile-grass, and of Eringoes candied,
of each six drams: one Apple cut: of the leaves of Burnet, Meadow-sweat, of
each one handful: of Raisons of the sun, one ounce and half: of Hartshorn
burnt, two drams: being cut and bruised, let them be boiled on a clear fire, in
four pints of spring water, to the consumption of the third part, to a quart of
the straining being cleared, add of the syrups of green Citrons, or Violets,
two ounces: of sal Prunella, one dram and half: make and Apozem: The Dose four
ounces to six thrice in a day.

36. Or into that straining put fifteen blanched sweet Almonds, and of the four
cold seeds, of each one dram: being bruised, make an Emulsion, according to Art.

37. Take Dragon and black Cherry water, of each four ounces: of Scordium
compound; two drams: of Treacle water, one ounce and half: syrup of
Clove-gilli-flowers, two ounces: of the spirit of Vitriol, twelve drops, make a
Julep.

38. Take oftentimes in a day, in small Beer or Posset Drink, half a dram, or
two scruples of Sal Prunellae.

39. Besides in this Fever, Medicines gently Sweating, of that sort chiefly,
which restores the Animal Spirits, and defends them from any heterogeneous
Copula are of very great use: wherefore, either the Powder of Pearls, or the
spirit of Hartshorn, or of Blood in a moderate Dose are administered twice a
day, viz. Morning and Evening.

40. Clysters are to be given almost every day, and if it be thought fit, a
gentle loosening purge may be taken once or twice in a Week.

41. The Di^t prescribed ought to be slender, as in other Fevers, let them be
wholly Interdicted from flesh, or broth made thereof, only let the Sick feed on
Grewel, or Barley-broth, and let their Drink be small Beer or Posset Drink.

42. If that notwithstanding any preventive Fever, the morbifick matter should
lodge in the Brain or Lungs, or both together, so that a dissolution, or
inordination of the Animal function, or a violent Cough, should assault them,
it must be considered, what is to be done in either state of the Disease,
carried forth after the manner, into an evil condition; but then the curative
Indications ought to respect the stupor or madness or Cough.

43. And lastly, if in the declination of the Disease these symptom do remit,
proper remedies are to be adhibited against the Atrophie, as it were, the last
fortress of this Fever.

44. First, Therefore if the morbifick matter, as it is often wont, being
brought to the Brain, should bring in an insensibleness, or a soporiferous or
sleepy distemper; remedies drawing it another way and deriving it some way from
the Head, and besides such as stir up the Animal spirits and take away the
impure Copula, ought carefully to be administered.

45. Wherefore in this case, the use of Epispasticks or such things that drew
the water outwardly, should be much increased; and let spirits of Hartshorn,
be exhibited almost every sixth hour, in a little bigger dose.

46. Let Blood also be taken away by the sucking Leeches, more largely from the
Jugular Veins, Salvatella, or the Sedal Veins.

47. If the distemper remits not, the Head being shaven, let emollient
fomentations be often applied thereto: further let Cupping-glasses, Plasters
and Cataplasms, be laid to the soals of the Feet and other means of
administration, such as are commonly prescribed for the curing of the stupor,
or insensibleness, ought to be used.

48. In like manner, if on the evil days or Crisis of this Fever, a Frenzy
or Madness should come, remedies appropriate to those distempers, made use of.

49. Secondly, But if either with, or without this sort of displeasure brought
to the Head, the Lungs also have taken the evil of this Disease, so that the
sick not yet free from the Fever, seems to fall into a wasting or Consumption,
with a troublesome Cough, with abundance of thick and often discolored spittle;
Medicines commonly prescribed for such kind of distempers, are convenient
enough.

50. Wherefore pectoral Decoctions, Electuaries, Syrups, distilled Waters of
Milk and Snails, and other Remedies of the like nature, ought diligently to be
made use off, the Forms of which may be found, in the before described Cases.

51. Thus far we have described the continual Fever, for the most part
convulsive, and arising no less from the fault of the nervous Juice than of the
Blood; I will here farther propose an Example of a Disease; having the likeness
of an intermitting Fever, but radicated chiefly in the nervous Juice; the
nature of which kind of Distemper, for that is very rare, and truly pertinent
to our convulsive Pathology will appear from the following History.

52. A noted Woman, very young and endued with a more weak Constitution of
Brain and nervous Stock, and for causes very obnoxious to convulsive
Distempers, after she had conceived with Child, about the fourth Month of her
being big, cold being taken, she was greivously afflicted with asthmatical
Fits, and besides, with a frequent sinking down of her Spirits.

53. But by the use of Remedies, endued with a volatile Salt, she grew well,
within a fortnights space, but after that, about fourteen days, an unwonted and
truly admirable Distemper fell upon this Gentlewoman.

54. One Morning awaking after an unqiuet Sleep that night, she felt a light
shivering over all her Body, as if she had had the Fit of an Ague: fr^quent
Yawnings and Reachings, with an endeavor to vomit followed thereupon.

55. And then her Urine, which was but now of a Citron Color, and of a
laudable Substance, became pale and waterish: moreover about her Loins and
Hypochondria, and in other places, Pains with light Convulsions, running about
here and there were excited.

56. Which kind of Symptoms plainly convulsive, with her frequent making a of
limpid Urine, continued in the Morning almost to Evening, in which space of
time, a great quantity of water, at least three times more than the Liquor she
had taken, was rendered in the mean time, neither was the Heat great, nor did
Thirst trouble her, nor was her Pulse increased.

57, In the Evening the aforesaid Distempers ceased, and her Urine became of a
Citron Color and moderate, and besides all night she enjoyed a moderate Sleep,
then in the Morning following, about the same hour, the Fit returned,
accompaned altogether with the like Symptoms, and so daily acted the same
Tragedy.

58. Visiting this Gentlewoman, after she had been sick in this manner for
twelve days, I framed the Aethiolo^y of the aforesaid Case, to wit, that this
Disease chiefly radical in the nervous Stock, did depend upon the Effervescenoy
and Flux of the Humor, watering the nervous Parts.

59. For it might be suspected that this water being diffused from the Blood,
made degenerate by reason of the suppression of her Terms, upon the Brain and
nervous Stock, became more sharp and serous than it ought to be, and for that
Cause incongruous to the containing Parts.

60. Wherefore, being gathered together to a plenitude, by the nights sleep:
did provoke them and stir them up for the expulsion of it, every where into
wrinklings and contractions: hence shiverings, yaunings, stretchings and
wondering pains, were excited in the whole Body.

61. Furthermore from the solid parts after this manner contracted, and shaken,
not only the nervous liquour, but also the nutritious every where laid up the
solid parts, but not truly assimulated were shaken of:

62. And then either Latex, being exterminated from its receptacles, and
received by the Veins or Lymphaducts, or water-carrying Vessels, was rendered to
the mass of blood, from whose bosom, (before it had acquired a Lixival tincture
from it,) being at last cast forth by the reins, constituted a clear and
copious Ruin.

63. But that this distemper observed such exact periods; the reason is,
because the nervous water being supplied with an equal dimension, did arise to
a fullness of running over, daily at the set time.

64. Therefore also, the urine appeared concocted and yellow, before and after
the fit, because then its matter consisted only from the Serum of the blood:
afterward, during the convulsive fit, the limpid humor being shaken off, from
the solid and nervous parts, and passing quickly thorough the blood adulterated
the color and quantity of the urine.

65. I prescribed to this big-bellied Woman, Phlebotomy, and besides a powder
composed out of Coral, Pearls, Ivory, and other Cardiacks, to be taken thrice
in a day, in a proper liquor.

66. Morning and Evening she took of the Tincture of Antimony, twelve drops
(whose singular effect in the too great flux of urin, I have many times
experienced) by the use of these, all the symptoms ceased in a short time:
Willis de morbis convulsivis, cap. 8.

LIX. A Convulsion in a young Maiden.

1. I was sent for, some years since, to come and visit a noble Virgin who was
sick almost after the same manner, but something worse: For these almost
perpetual involuntary motions came by turns, to wit, shakings of the Head and
members, or defluctions or movings about here and there.

2. Besides she was afflicted with a very troublesome and wonderful Convulsion,
of the Diaphragma and Muscles serving for breathing: For every minute of an
hour and oftener, her backbone was suddenly bent in, about its middle, and
together her Breast shooting out forward.

3. And her Hypocondria being drawn inwards, she made a loud sobbing, now
double, now threefold, but still with a less and less noise.

4. This kind of motion, and ebbing of a crashing noise, was wont to come for
many hours, and so that she might be heard through the whole house.

5. And when any short interval of this happened, she was compelled presently to
shake or writh together her Arms and Hands, and sometimes her Legs and Feet, and
also to fling about most furiously her Head, and by and by to hold her Neck, as
if it were stiff and unmovable.

6. And then in speaking, her Tongue would be taken after that manner, that she
would repeat the same word very often, yea sometimes twenty times at least.

7. When the convulsive motions tormented her stongly in her outward Members,
she was free a little while from that noise in the Throat, and this space of
intermission she called her time of ease.

8. Though in the mean time, her Head and Members were carried violently here and
there with convulsive motions.

9. If at any time she lay on her left side, presently a contraction of her
right Hypochondrium inwards, with a sobbing and noise, vexed her.

10. Within a few day, her strength being very much lost by the assiduity of
the passions, she contracted so great an imbecility in her loins and joints of
her Legs, that she could not lean, nor stand on her Feet: her Somach,
distempered either with weakness, or the Convulsion, returned back, whatever
was put into it, by vomit.

11. In this case as in the former it evidently appears that the animal
spirits, not only those implanted in this or that part or region, had
contracted an Heterogeneous Copula to be shaken off by some turns, but also the
spirits influencing some Nerves, being imbued with explosive particles, had
brought in the perpetual and wandering convulsive motions.

12. And when at first it hapened, that the Spirits so afflicted, did assault
not only all the Nerves together, nor any indifferently, but for the most part,
only those belonging to the Diaphragma and the Appendices of the spinal marrow,
so that within those spaces, the fury of the spirits, perpetually explosing was
limited.

13. For this reason it hapened, that the convulsive affections being
restrained, in any one of these parts, did break forth more furiously strait
way in another.

14. And when by their proper instinct, their motive force was employed in one
region, the same was in the mean time, wont to be remitted in another.

15. Moreover in this sick person, the morbifick matter, consisting both of
Narcotick and convulsive Particles, caused together the paralytick and
convulsive distemper.

16. Coming to her on the fourth day, I gave her an Emetick potion, by which
she vomited seven times, abundance of ropy Phlegm, with yellow choler, yet
without any ease.

17. On the next day, I took six ounces of Blood, from her left Arm, presently
from thence the Blood being more impetuously carried toward the Head, she
complained mightily of an Headache and giddiness; But within three days she
being let Blood in the Foot, found herself better.

18. She afterward took remedies for the Distempers of the Nerves, to wit,
spirit of Hartshorn and of Blood, Bezoartick and shelly powders, Juleps and
Electuaries, Antispasmatical: by the use of these, the symptoms seemed to be
something remitted, but yet they remained somewhat after the manner lately
described:

19. After a fortnight, by the prescription of a certain country-Woman; she
took in a draught of Beer, six spoonfulls of blood, taken from the Ear of an
Ass, by which she seemed on a sudden to be cured: For forthwith all the
convulsive motions did leave her, and she remained free from them twenty four
hours.

20. But yet the Disease returning the next day, with its wonted force would
not give place, neither to that remedy, nor indeed easily to any other, she
therefore for the future took Medicines methodically prescribed:

21. Once within sick days she was gently purged, besides she took the powder
composed of Bezoar, Pearls and Coral, with the roots and seeds of Peony, also
an Electuary, prescribed by Horstius for these kind of admirable Convulsions;
also Juleps, and deco^tions, proper in convulsive distempers.

22. Clysters were often used, frictions, ointments, and vesicatories were
administered with success; within another week, the sobbing affection wholly
ceased, and likewise the other convulsive motions being grown more gentle, by
degrees, very much remitted.

23. Growing well of these Distempers, a Catarrh falling down in her Throat,
she was so much troubled, that she almost continually spit forth a sharp, and
as it were a corrosive spittle, as if she had had a Salivation by the taking
of Mercury, which kind of rememedy indeed has been found to have been the last
event in this case.

24. But I wholly abstained from administering it, because both the sick and her
Friends, would not give me leave.

25. After this plentiful and troublesome spitting had continued for many days,
the Disease seemed almost to be wholly cured, so that this noble Gentlewoman,
being free of her convulsive motions, went abroad, and was well both in
strength and Stomach.

26. Only she complained that oftimes in a day she was suddenly afflicted about
a minute of an hour, with a shivering of her whole Body, which kind of
Distemper coming upon her sometimes in the Night, broke her sleep.

27. Within the space of a month, this symptom also, and likewise her Catarrh
wholly ceased: But from thence, she was sometimes afflicted with an extreme
soreness in her Ventricle, and the passage of the Oesophagus, an sometimes also
in her Mouth and Palate, that it was feared least the inward skin being
fretted, those parts should contract an ulcerous disposition.

28. Besides she was tormented often in her sleep, sometimes also being awaked
with the night Mare or Incubus: For this I prescribed, Spring and Fall, a
gentle purge to be administered, with the use of Antiscorbutick remedies, and
sometimes Chalibiates, or Medicines of prepared Steel, which kind of method she
observed so much to her benefit, that she was in health for many years, and is
as yet well.

29. Among the many remedies, which were taken against that sourness, and as it
were ulcerous disposition of the Pallat and Oesophagus, I prescribed that she
should drink every morning, her own Urine fresh made.

30. This whilst it was very saltish, was wont to give her great ease; but at
sometimes, her Urine flowed from her thin and plentifully, which being nothing
salt, but like to sour Vinegar, from the drinking of that she received little
or no benefit.

31. The reason of the case but now described, seems not much unlike the
former, unless that in this sick Gentleman, the explosive particles had entered
into more passages of the Nerves, to wit, besides the Appendices of the spinal
marrow into those dedicated for the office of breathing, and also by fits, into
those designed for the motion of the Tongue, and almost perpetually tormented
the Spirits abounding in them, with rage or fury.

32. But that the cure of this Disease happened by the falling down of the
sharp humor into the emunctores of the Mouth and Throat, we may from thence
gather, that the material cause of this, was the heterogeneous particles, and
as it were nitrous begotten in the blood; which, when from thence being pasted
through from the Brain, they were carried into the nervous stock, caused the
aforesaid Distempers.

33. But as soon as by the help of remedies the more plentiful provision of
that matter was hindered, and the morbifick particles already produced from the
blood, Brain and nervous stock, were derived into those Emunctories of the
Head, the convulsive distemper presently ceased, and within a short time, such
a Crisis or secretion still remaining, the perfect cure of the Disease followed:

34. For as much as the Urine, being of it self very salt, and as it were
Lixivial, became at sometimes sowerish, which did not give any help as the
former to the sourness of the Throat, it may be hence gathered, that the salt
particles of the blood and humors coming away by the urine, had a two fold
state or condition, to wit, of fixedness and fluedness.

35. Wherefore the serum imbued by them became now of this, now of that nature,
For it seems that the saline particles being deg^nerate within the mass of the
blood, remained fixed and rendered the urine for the most part lixivial.

36. But those which flowed without the blood, in the nervous juice, or were
laid up about the solid parts, did degenerate into a flux or acetousness, and
therefore from these, being derived into the emunctiores of the Mouth, that
noted sourness of the Mouth, and Oesophagus proceeded.

37. Moreover when these kind of particles being gathered to a fullness in the
nervous juice and solid parts, did swell up and arising to a fluxion, boiled up
into the blood: presently these being sent away from thence, in heaps through
the Reins, rendered the urine increased in quantity, sourish.

38. But for as much as the saline particles, being of a diverse condition, and
that those of the same kind could not be mingled together, they mutually moved
against one another, and break their forces, therefore the salt urine and not
the sour healed the sourness of the Throat.

39. It appears by a vulgar Experiment that the most sharp spirits of Vitriol,
by the mixture of the salt of Tartar, or any other lixivial grows very mild:
and yet from thence appears, that the acid humor, sweating out into the parts
of the Mouth and Throat of this Gentlewoman, came near the nature of sharp
Vitriol.

40. Because the fume of Tobacco, being taken at the Mouth of the sick person,
was wonderfully sweet, as it happens to such, who have beforehand tasted
Vitriol. Willis, de morbis convulsivis, cap. 9. Observe. 2.

LX. A Convulsion in a noble Virgin.

1. Because we treat here of admirable Convulsions, which do not ordinarily
happen, and whose nature and causes, ly deeply hid, for the better illustration
of these kinds of distempers, we will yet show one or two more cases no less
wonderful than the former.

2. About ten years since, I visited the Daughter of a certain noble Man,
afflicted after this manner with convulsive motions, that some thought her
possessed with an evil Spirit.

3. This Beautiful and well shaped Virgin, about the age of sixteen, begotten
of a Paralytick Father, without any evident cause, about the Winter Solstice
began to grow very ill.

4. At first she was troubled with the Headache, though not after a grievous
manner, as also for many days with a giddiness; then she felt now in one of her
Arms, then in another, a trembling and sudden contraction, which kind of
Convulsions, returning often in that day, endured scarce a moment.

5. The next day sitting in a Chair near her Sister, suddenly leaping out, she
took several Jumps successively with wonderful Agility, every Jump being
several foot in length, then when she was come to the further part of the
Chamber, she stood leaping, a great while in the same place, and every time a
great height.

6. When her Legs were quite tired with leaping, she fell on the Floor, and
presently she flung her head here and there, with wonderful Violence, as if she
would shake it from her Neck.

7. As soon as she ceased from this Motion for weariness, presently the same
Fury invaded her Hands and Feet, so that she was forced violently to exercise
her Members by striking the Walls or Posts, or by beating the Pavement.

8. When by reason of Shame or Modesty, before her Friends and the Bystanders,
she did with some kind of violence hinder her self from these Motions (for all
the while she was her self and spoke soberly) the Distemper being sent
inwardly, she was very much afflicted with a very great Oppression of the
Heart, which caused her to sob and bemoan her self.

9. When she would ease her self, the Fury being transmitted to the Muscles of
the outward Limbs, she was forced presently to leap about, to fling here and
there her Head, or Arms, as also to run about the Chamber, or to beat the
Ground with her Feet.

10. Because these kinds of vehement Motions of her Limbs or Viscera in the
Tragedy of the D^stemper, did mutually relieve themselves, returning as it were
in a Round.

11. Coming the fifth day, after this Lady was sick, I gave her a Vomit of the
Infussion of Crocus Metallorum, Wine of Squills, and Salt of Vitriol, by which
she vomited seven times cankered Oil or Choler, in great plenty, with the
Mixture of a sharp and as it were vitriolick Humor.

12. The next day ten ounces of Blood was taken from the Saphena Vein, besides
she took twice a day Antidotes of the Pouders of precious Stones, of Man's
Skull, and the root of Male-Peony: By the use of these within a week she seemed
to be cured; and she continued for many days afterward free from the aforesaid
Distempers.

13. But after two weeks at the time of the full Moon, she fell into a Relapse
of the same Disease more cruel than before; for besides those wonderful
Leapings and vehement Conversions and Roulings about of her Head and Members,
she was forced besides to fetch often a most rapid Course round about her
Chamber.

14. She began at this time by the praescriptions of others, to take
anti-hysterical Medicines, and purges at certain set Intervals, but without any
Help.

15. At last, I being sent for, because she seemed endued with a strong Habit
of Body, and with a notable Fierceness of Spirits; I gave her a stronger
Emmatick, by which she vomited forth ten times, greenish Choler like to Rust,
with Phlegm sharp like Stygian Water and she was suddenly eased:

16 After this, I gave her every Morning a Draught of white Wine dilated with
the water of Black-Cherries, with Sows or Hog-Lice bruised and infused therein
and strongly pressed forth.

17. By the use of these she seemed presently to be cured, and was well above a
Month: and when afterward, the Distemper being about to return, she felt at
any time some Forerunners, presently by the use of the Vomit, and the
expression of the Millepedes or Cheslogs, she averted the approach of the
Disease.

18. Within three Months, she so far recovered her former Health, that she has
now lived these many years free from those kinds of convulsive Distempers; But
from the time the convulsive Passions wholly ceased she was sometimes troubled,
about the parts of her Mouth and Throat, with a Defluction of a most sour
Humor, like the vitriolick Stagma.

19. Besides, sometimes she was obnoxious to the Pica or longing of Women, and
at sometimes also to the Cough, with a discolored Spittle threatening a
Consumption, notwithstanding which, by Remedies used in these kinds of Cases,
she was easily cured.

20. As to the Aetiology or rational Account of the aforesaid Case, there is no
reason that we should fear to refer both the Causes and Symptoms of this
Disease to the explosive Particles (the Brain being passed through without
hurt) sent as a supply, continually from the Blood, into the nervous Stock.

21. Which, forasmuch as they being poured forth in great plenty, were not
restrained within private Mines, to be struck off gently by turns, cleaving
every where, both to the implanted and inflowing Spirits, forced them as it
were inspired with a Madness, to be perpetually explosed, and to grow raging
here and there, by Bands.

22. So that indeed they were not able at all to be ruled within the containing
Parts, but there was need to subdue and tame them which did so impetuously
tumultuat, and were apt to be carried here and there like a Whirlwind, by some
violent and strong Motion.

23. It was in this sick Person as it is in musical Organs, which if filled
above Measure by too great a blast of Wind, unless presently the Passages of
more Pipes be opened, the whole Frame of the Organ is quickly shaken, and in
danger to be broken to pieces.

24. In like manner in this Lady, when the animal Spirits, actuating the Pipes
and the depending Fibers of some of the Nerves, were moved beyond their due
Tenor, there was a Necessity, that their Force should be bestowed on many
vehement local Motions together, whilst they inflated above measure the nervous
Bodies.

25. Wherefore when their Madness was hindered in one part, by and by like Wind
pent up, creeping some where else, it broke forth more violently into some
other part.

26 In this sick Person, the use of one or two Vomits brought help once or
twice, because that by it, what was lodged in the Gall-Vessel, yea the
Glandula's and Emunctories, and also about the Viscera of Concoction, being by
this means emptied, the purging of the Blood and nervous Juice, were more
copiously drawn into the same place.

27. Therefore that the animal Spirits, flowing within the Pipes of the
distempered Nerves, might be less infected by them; By this reason also the
Juice of the Sows or Hog-Lice was beneficial, forasmuch as it derived the
morbifick Matter, from the nervous system to the urinary Passages:

28. Besides these, the root, and in a great part, the branches of the
morbifick matter being cut off, and when others, as it were Antidotes, hindering
every where its Vegetation, were carefully administered, what was left of it,
nature at length becoming superior (as she is wont in these critical Cases)
sent away, to the Sinks of the Mouth and Throat. Willis de Morbis convulsivis
Cap. 9. Obser. 3.

LXI. A Convulsion in a noble Virgin.

1. I visited an illustrious Virgin, who was troubled with other kind of
convulsive Motions, and those universal and no less to be admired: she was
about the age of eighteen, handsome and well shaped, and before this time
healthful; the Pestilence raging in this Neighborhood, and she being in danger
of its Contagion, she fell into a pannick Fear, with frequent swooning.

2. The Night following, she was under so great a Deliquium or sinking down of
her Spirits and insensibility, that she seemed just a dying, hardly struggling
with so great an Evil, afterward she had every day convulsive Fits, though at
first at uncertain hours, and returning after a manifold kind.

3. But within a short time, its comings being made regular, twice in a day, to
wit, they constantly returned at eleven of the clock, and before five in the
afternoon, that no intermitting Fever, kept more exactly its periods; yea
also the same accidents of the Fit daily chanced after the same manner.

4. When she had thus been sick for three weeks, one day I was sent for, that I
might take notice of all the Symptoms, and the whole Figure of the Disease.

5. She being up, about ten in the Morning, seemed to be well as to her
countenance, speech and walking; in every action she behaved herself so well
that none suspected her to be any ways indisposed; about eleven of the clock
she began to complain of the repletion of her Head and the numbness of her
Spirits, accompaned with a light swimming; by and by she felt a great
Pulsation, and as it were the leaping of some live Animal in her left
Hypochondrium.

6. Putting my hand on her side, I plainly perceived this motion, then a
stretching and belching followed, which done she was presently put to bed, and
a Maid sitting upon a Pillow held her down; who during the fit most strickly
graspt the sick Person; holding her to her bosom with her Arms folded about her
wast.

7. Besides Servants were ready, and her Relations standing by, who now pressed
down her Belly, and Hypochondria rising up, and swelling to a great Bulk, now
held her Hands and Arms.

8. The chief Symptoms of the Disease, which being excited by turns, almost
divided the whole Fit, were these, one while cruel Convulsions of the Bowels
did afflict her, so that the Abdomen rising up into a mighty Bulk, so strove
against the hands, held upon it, that it could not be pressed down, and at the
same time, her Praecordia being contracted upwards, the Motions of her Blood
and Heart, were almost stopped, in which space of time, this Virgin, her Head
falling down, lay nigh senseless, with a small Pulse and almost without Voice.

9. After two or three minutes of an hour these Convulsions ceased: and then the
sick Person setting her self upright, looked about cheerfully, and for a while
the force of the Disease was changed into talking and singing, which she
performed without ceasing most pleasantly, and elegantly, beyond her proper
Capacity.

10. With these kinds of Speeches and pleasant Jests she fell upon all the
Bystanders, that nothing in a Comedy could be more pleasant. Then she uttered
most melodious sweet Tunes, such as could not be paralelled by any other, nay
not by her self at another time.

11. After she passed some little time thus jesting and singing, the
Convulsions of her Bowels and Praecordia, and the want of Speech came upon her,
as before; and these soon remitting, the force of the Spirits leaping back from
the inferior Nerves on the Brain, she was employed much after the manner above
mentioned.

12. But if any of the Bystanders did at any time answer her ruggedly, when
she talked to them, she fell into those most grievous and longer continuing
Convulsions of the Viscera.

13. After this manner she was wont to be molested with an alternate Distemper
of the Bowels and Brain, for about the space of an hour: then toward the End
of the Fit declining, more light Convulsious of the Viscera being made, they
were repeated three or four times, without any Intermission.

14. Then these wholly ceasing, the force of the Disease brake forth into her
outward Members, from whence it quickly vanished; for her Arms, and Legs about
one minute, suffered leapings forth and contractions; presently after the sick
Person left her bed (being free from Convulsions) till a new Fit returned.

15. She walked about the house, her strength being indifferent good, and
during the Interval of her Distemper, she cheerfully performed the acustomed
Offices of life; except the languishing of her Stomach, which appeared in her
loathing of food almost all day; but at Evening after her second Fit, she
supped moderately.

16. This was the present State of the Disease, in whose Fits the clear use and
free Exercise of some Faculties, seemed in a manner to make Compensation for
the Irregularity of others, about the beginning of her Sickness, it was somewhat
otherwise.

17. For the Convulsions of her Bowels were far more grievous, and an
insensibility was joined to them; besides in their Interval, talking idly, an
incongruous singing, yea both Laughter and Weeping without any manifest
Occasion breaking forth, were wont to follow one another.

18. But now the animal Spirits being forced into longer Explosions, performed
them so regularly, that they seemed after a manner to be done by the command of
the Will and Reason.

19. That we may therefore according to our Hypothesis, frame an Aetiology or
rational account of this Distemper; in the first place, it seems that a
vehement fear did drive the Spirits inhabiting the Brain and Praecordia into
great Disorders: so that they being disturbed out of their Ranks, both the
kinds of her Madness or Foolishness and the frequent swooning succeeded.

20. Further it may be suspected, that from the same impression, the hurt was
carried to the Brain it self, so that its conformation being somewhat vitiated,
the heterogeneous and morbifick particles were admitted together with the
nervous juice.

21. Then although the spirits at the beginning, being confused and troubled
after their short Inordinations, at last recovered themselves and performed the
wonted offices both of the animal and vital function; yet by reason of the
taint impressed upon the Brain, the heterogeneous particles being constantly
admitted, cleaving to those Spirits, induced explosive endeavors, as soon as
the spirits were filled to a plenitude with the extraneous Copula, they being
irritated entered into convulsive explosions for the shaking or striking it off.

22. About the beginning of the Disease, when both the disposition of the Brain
and the spirits inhabiting it, was more perverse and vicious, from the fresh
received hurt, and a fullness of the heterogeneous Copula sooner happened, and
so its explosion following more often and more inordinately, was dispatched
with greater tumult.

23. But afterward, when the hurt of the animal regiment abating, the
suppliments of that Copula, even as the nervous liquor were daily brought in
with an equal dimension, the explosions of the Spirits being made more regular
and mild, observed their just periods or set times.

24. So that upon the approach of the fit, she felt a fullness, and as it were
an inflation, in her Head, with a heaviness and dullness of the Spirits; the
reason is, because at this time the Spirits inhabiting the Brain being now
prepared for explosions, were wont first of all to be moved, and as it were to
swell up, then that pulsation in her lef^ Hypochondria succeeded.

25. For that the Spirits inhabiting the nervous foldings and fibers thickly
planted about the Spleen, began to be explosed; afterward, when the Spirits,
flowing both within the Mesenterick and Cardiack enfoldings, were explosed
together, those elevations, and as it were leapings up of the Abdomen and
Thorax, were induced.

26. And when in this distemper, the motions of the Blood and Heart were almost
wholly stopped, therefore there was a small and almost no Pulse, and she became
speechless and in a manner senseless.

27. The Convulsion of the Viscera and Praecordia remitting, a prattling and
singing succeeded, because a falling down or removal of the Spirits as yet
explosed, being made from the nervous stock into the Brain, it changed the
Convulsions into an exaltation of the fancy and more ready exercise of the
phantasms, or representation of the imagination.

28. So long as the Spirits within the middle of the Brain are regularly and
orderly explosed, they bring forth the Acts of the habits and faculties so much
more noble, and as it were above the strength and tenor of nature, as in this
sick Gentlewoman.

29. But on the contrary, when the explosions of the Spirits in that region,
happen to be inordinate they cause, for the most part, foolishness; or at least
the exercise of their Powers are incongruous and absurd.

30. The Convulsions of the Bowels and the fantastic actions relieved one
another mutually, and by turns, because plenty of Spirits being disposed to be
struck off, made their tendency, as it were with a direct or reflected waving
or undulation, now on this part, now, on that by turns.

31. Then lastly, when they were almost all explosed, the more often
Convulsions of the Viscera were stirred up, and when a small handful only
remained to be explosed, that being at last excluded both from the Head and
Bowels, it ran forth into the spinal marrow, and employed the last assault of
the Disease, in the Convulsions of the Arms and Legs.

32. There yet remains one great difficulty in this case why the fits of this
Disease were always repeated exactly at set hours, and yet had so unequal
periods, to wit, that the coming of the first was only but six hours before the
second, and then the return of the next, did not happen but in eighteen hours
space.

33. For the solving of this, it is to be supposed, that these fits did depend
upon the nervous juice being stuffed to a plenitude, with Heterogeneous
particles: which particles were altogether conveyed thither from the
Bloody-mass, and the Blood did drink up the same from the nourishing juice sent
as a supply from the Bowels.

34. These being thus supposed, we must consider, in what space of time, the
Bloody-mass is filled with those morbifick particles, and then, in what measure
it pours them forth into the nervous liquor.

35. As to these, that it may the better apappear, after what manner it was
done in the c^se of this sick person, you must know that she took in the space
of twenty four hours only at one time a full meal: to wit, after the second fit
was ended, she supped moderately, about seven of the Clock, the rest of the day
being without an Appetite, she hardly took any food.

36. Therefore it is probable that the morbifick matter was poured forth with
the nutrious provision into the Bloody mass, chiefly in the night; and that
more plentifully than that all could presently be derived into the nervous
Liquor.

37. The Heterogeneous particles, which are first conveyed from the Blood into
the nervous liquor, newly satisfied, being heaped up to a fullness, did excite
the first fit, the coming of which therefore was longer delayed, because both
one space is required wherein the Blood, and then another wherein the Brain and
Nerves are to be filled.

38. After this fit was over, because the Blood yet full, containing in it self
more particles of the same kind, pours them suddenly on the nervous juice
therefore the other fit is induced within thrice the space of the former.

39. But this being ended, because both the bloody mass and the nervous juice,
are wholly freed from their burden, the sick person finding her self better,
than at any other time, took her food gredily enough.

40. But after that, when to the next following fit, first the bloody mass and
then the nervous juice, ought to be filled with the morbifick matter, therefore
ten hours are required for this double task.

41. But for as much, as there is only need for the second fit, that the other
particles yet full should be derived from the bloody mass into the nervous
juice, therefore for this effect, a much less space does suffice, viz of six
hours.

42. After I had seen this Lady, who had labored for many weeks with these
kind of periodical fits, I ordered that three hours before the second fit, ten
ounces of Blood should be taken out of a vein in the Foot.

43. Which being done, the coming of the fit, which was expected in the
evening, quite left her, neither did it return again afterward.

44. But the other fit, observing its former time, daily returned, till the
Patient being let Blood, a little before its coming, remained that day free
from the Disease, which however, returning the day after, according to the same
manner, exercised her many months.

45. In the mean time, because the cold of the Winter, was very great, she
forbore for some time the use of Remedies: but the Spring coming on, this
honorable Lady being brought to Oxford, was cured by the following method.

46. First I gave her this Cathartick, and I took care that it was repeated
every sixth or seventh day: Take of the Sulphur of Antimony, six grains: of
Mercurius Dulcis, one scruple: of the resin of Jalap, four grains: of Ginger,
six grains: let them be beaten together in a Mortar, then add of the conserves
of Violets, one dram: make a Bolus; it was wont to provoke two or three vomits,
and three or four stools.

47. The flux of her Terms came constantly in great abundance at the set times:
wherefore when the Blood seemed very plentiful and hot, I ordered Phlebotomy
twice or thrice in the midst betwixt the times of her Terms.

48. Besides every day that she did not purge she took twice in a day four
Pills of the following mass; drinking after them a little draught of the Julep
below prescribed:

59. Take Male-Peony roots, half an ounce: of Virginian snake-weed,
Contrayerva, Cretick Dittany, of each two drams: of man's skull prepared, one
dram and half: of an Elks-Claw, one dram: of red Coral prepared of the powder
of Pearls, of each one dram: of the salt of Wormwood, two drams: of the salt of
Coral, one dram: with the syrup of the flowers of Male Peony a sufficient
quantity make a mass.

50. Take of the water of the flowers of Male-peony, of black Cherries, and of
Walnuts, of each four ounces: of the Antepileptick of Langius, two ounces: of
the syrup of the flowers of Peony, one ounce and half: of Castor tied in a
knot, and hung in the Glass, one dram: mix them and make a Julep.

51. When she began to loath the Pills; they being omitted, she took twice a
day, to wit, in the Morning and Evening, about one scruple of the following
powder, in a spoonful of the Julep, drinking after it four or five spoonfulls
of the same.

52. Take of Bozar-stone, of white Amber, of Pearls prepared, of red Coral, of
each one scruple: of Man's skull, two scruples: of the root of
Virginian-snake-weed, and the seeds of Rue, of each half a dram: mingle them,
and make a powder, let her take one scruple Morning and Evening, with a dose of
the above prescribed Julep.

53. Then, when also this Medicine began to be tedious to her, she used the
Pills or the Elixir Proprietatis, and also sometimes for many days the Spirits
of Hartshorn, at last, she began to be helped by that powder, being for some
space daily taken.

54. In the mean time whilst this method of healing was ordained, her Hair
being shaved from her Head, it was covered only with a thin covering: she wore
upon her Belly an Hysterical plaster mixed with Galbanum for her ordinary
drink, she took a Decoction of Sarsa, and China, the roots of the male-Peony
and other proper things, infused in spring water and boiled.

55. Within a month, the fits were something remitted, then being by degrees
made gentler and lesser; at length they almost quite ceased: unless that at the
time of her Terms, one or two fits of the Disease was wont to trouble her:

56. Further, she was afflicted with an almost constant Giddiness, and
queaziness of Stomach; in the middle of the Summer, she drunk Astrop waters for
a fortnight, and was perfectly well.

57. But as for the means in general, to be shown for the Cure of those
admirable Convulsions, it will not be easy to assign either fit Remedies for
this Herculean Disease, or a certain method of Cure, approved by often
Experience:

58. For, besides that these like Cases are seldom met with, it is likewise
observed, that the same Medicines which at this time were helpful to this sick
person being given to another, or the same, helped nothing at another time.

59. The reason of which seems to be, because the cause of the Disease consists
in the Discrasie, or evil disposition of the nervous juice, which liquour is
not always perverted, after one and the same manner.

60. But by the manifold combination of the Salts and Sulphurs, it got a morbid
nature after a various manner and kind, and oftentimes changes it.

61. Wherefore in the most grievous distempers of this kind, not the vulgar
Medicines taken from the Shops or Dispensatory are to be prescribed, but
magistrals; as cause arises according to the appearance of the admirable
symptoms.

62. A gentle vomit, purge, blood-letting, ought to be in the first place
ordained, and to be repeated as often as shall seem fit.

63. As to specific Medicines and appropriate in these Cases, when the chief
indication shall be, to mend the temper of the nervous juice, you may try many,
and by their effect Judge of their virtues: Therefore it may be Lawful to try,
what the remedies endued with a volatile or Armoniack salt, may effect.

64. For this end the Spirits and Salts of Hartshorn, blood, soot, and the
flowers and spirits of sal Armoniack are taken.

65. These helping nothing, you must come to Chalybiats or Steel-medicines: the
tinctures and solutions of Coral and Antimony are given: which kind of
Medicines are exhibited in such a dose and form, and so often, that some
alteration may be made by them on the whole Body or nervous juice.

66. Moreover, if success shall fail in such like, you must then proceed to
Alexipharmaticks which help against Poisons, and the malignancy impressed on
the humors.

67. To wit, to institute from these Decoctions and distilled waters of
Vegetables, powders, Conserves, and other preparations; and to compound
variously some with the others, and to administer them diversely.

68. It is not improbable that those kind of Medicines which are wont to be
helpful to such as are bitten by a Viper or mad-dog, or that have taken
Wolfs-bane or poison, may be useful also in the aforesaid Convulsions.

69. It may be lawful here, according to the Example of Gregorius Horstius, in
his Tract of the malignant convulsive Disease, and also of wonderful
Convulsions, to prescribe magisterial remedies, in the form of a purging
Electuary, and also of a powder and convulsive antidote, and to compound them
variously, partly of simple Alexipharimicks, or Poison resisters and partly of
antepileptick. Willis, de Covulsivis, cap. 9. Observe. 4.

LXII. A Convulsion from a continual Fever.

1. An Illustrious Virgin, about the age of fourteen, fell into a Fever with a
signal diminution of strength and fear of the Measels, which in the year 1614
were very epidemical, after which a Palsy of some parts and grievous
Convulsions; the principal Faculties not being hurt.

2. Medicines were used for easing the Belly, then such as resist rottenness,
and by the benefit of sweat and occult transpiration move the peccant matter
from the center to the circumference.

3. First we applied this Clyster: Take Marshmallows, white Lillies, of each
three drams (...) the leaves of Mallows, Marshmallows, Herb Mercury,
Beares-Breech, Violets, of each half an handful: flowers of Cammomil, Melilot,
one pugil: Line-seed, Faenugreek, of each two scruples: fat Figgs, number
eight, boil them all in a sufficient quantity of water: take nine ounces of the
Colature, the flowers of Cassia, six drams: Electuarium, Diaphaenicon, two
drams: Oil of Chammomil, Honey of Roses strained, of each one ounce: common
Salt, two scruples:

4. When this was used, the Belly was well purged, but the excrements were not
very much altered, because the digestive faculty was very much weakened.

5. Afterward we endeavored to purge by exhibiting the Bezoar stone, seven
grains of which we prescribed with the water of Carduus Benedictus; upon which
because of the weakness of nature, there was not any sweat, yet there appeared
some signs of the measels.

6. And that nature might be helped in expelling; we prescribed this following
expulsive drink: Take Terra sigillata, half a draw: the Bezoar-stone, six
grains: Fumetory water, two ounces and half: the Vinegar of Elder, two drams:
mix them, and make a draught.

7. After the use of this the Measels did more and more appear, but they were
few in number, of whittish color, and a little resembling the color of Blew;
which is rather the sign of a dying than of an expelling Nature.

8. Her Fever notwithstanding was continued, and about the Evening for the
most part outrageous; therefore because of her great vehement thirst, we
prescribed her a Decoction of the roots of Succorie, and a Julep of the waters
of Borage, Sorrel and Fumitory mixed with syrup of Sorrel and Citrons.

9. Within a few days a Paralytick weakness seized the right side, as well as
the Arms and Feet, which was not continual in those parts but sometimes in one,
and sometimes in another place.

10. This Paralytick distemper, I take not to be a true Palsy but a bastard
one, much like to that which comes upon acute Fevers, though but seldom, where
the malignity is not perfectly discussed by the musculous habit; this symptom
must be helped and followed with external Medicines, Sudorificks and such
things as resist its malignity.

11. We did predict this Disease to be very difficult, because it seemed to
take its original from the Malignant matter not perfectly expelled.

12. While we did thus stick betwixt hope and fear, we did again help nature
because of the sluggishness of the Belly with a lenitive infusion; and we did
study to Evacuate the peccant matter by exhibiting a draught of the following
Laxative Wine.

13. Take the Leaves of choice Sena, half an ounce: Rubarb, one dram and half:
Agarick, two drams: Roots of Succory, Liquorish, of each five drams: the
Flowers of Peaches, six drams: Borage, one pugil and half: the Seeds of Anis
and Fennel, of each one dram: Mace and Galangal, of each two scruples: being
cut and bruised infuse them for the space of four and twenty hours, in half a
measure of mild Wine.

14. By this she had three stools and appeared to be much better, nature being
in some measure eased of that burden, with which formally it was oppressed
because of the obstruction of the Belly there continued still a weakness of the
extreme parts; upon which followed a Convulsion, whereby not only all the
Backbone, with the Vertebrae of the Neck (the Brain and Organs of the external
Senses remaining unhurt) but the Arms also Hands and Feet were variously
convulsed, not without great pain to the sick and the commiseration of the
Bystanders.

15. Although this Evil was fierce and outrageous enough, yet so great was the
strength of nature, that it did drive away the malignity from the fountain of
the animal Faculty, to wit, the Brain, to the backbone and extreme parts.

16. We thought fit therefore to order this following Liniment, for the
backbone to be used the first night: Take Oil of Cammomil, half an ounce: of
Earthworms, of Rue, of each six drams: Nutmeg by Expression, half a dram: mix
them.

17 We then exhibited a gentle Extension to the convulsed parts and a
Fomentation of the precious Apoplectick Water distilled with Castoreum and
mixed with the Water of Swallows; by which Fomentation and Aspertion the
Paroxisms oft-times were remitted to a miracle.

18. But we thought it necessary to continue still anointing of the backbone,
with yet a stronger Liniment: Take the Oil of sweet Almonds of Foxes, of each
one ounce: Castoreum, three drams: the Flowers of Cammomil, Rosemary, and
Marjoram, of each one pugil: the Apoplectick Water with Castoreum, two ounces:
boil them over a gentle fire to the consumption of the water, strain, and then
add one dram and half of the Oil of Turpentine, mix them.

19. In the mean time we did not neglect to exhibit Corroboratives, such as
restaurative broaths of the Gravey of Meat or Flesh, and Rouls and Morsels
proper for the Head and Heart.

20. A Confection of Rouls was after this mannner: Take Species Diambrae,
Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each half a scruple: white Amber praepared, one scruple:
Pearls praepared, half a dram: Oil of Nutmeg distilled, five drops: Sugar
dissolved in Tile-flowers, two ounces: make a Confection in Rouls.

21. Afterward we granted Morsels for the Heart because of her feverish heat,
they were such as were made of the Juice and Peels of Citrons, a small quantity
of Pearls prepared being added: and a little Sugar dissolved in a sufficient
quantity of Rose Water.

22. The fierceness of the symptoms being yet not very much abated, for the
further Dissipation of the malignant matter, and the strengthening of the Nerves
we ordered the following Cataplasm for the backbone.

23. Take Line-seed and Faenugreck, of each half a pound: the Flowers of
Cammomil, and leaves of Sage, of each two handfuls: Castoreum, two drams: boil
them in Water and Wine an equal proportion, add thereto the Oil of Rue and man's
grease, of each half an ounce: mix them and make a Cataplasm; which is to be
frequently applied warm.

24. Which being done, that wished for Remission of the convulsive Fits did
succeed, insomuch that the sick did rest well almost the whole night; this
being on the third of October, about the Morning of the following day there was
a swiftness in the Pulse with some Heat; which was presently abated, and
perhaps was occasioned by natures forcing what was hurtful from the internal to
the external Parts.

25, The Cataplasm was renewed and continued; neither were the Convulsions so
great and frequent as formerly, but when they came they were light, and by
Intervals happened to be in the right Arm with some pain; for the space of
three days we rested content with those Administrations, save that we succored
Nature once and again by a laxative Infusion, with Suppositories because the
Belly was somewhat constipated.

26. In the mean time the extreme parts because of the vehemence of the
precedent Convulsions did appear as if they were paralytick; therefore we
ordered this following Liniment.

27. Take the roots of Peony, Galangal, of each three drams: Tops of Sage,
Hysop, Betony, of each one pugil: the Flowers of Cammomil, of Peony, of each
half a pupil: the Leaves of Origanum, fresh Rue cut, of each half an handful:
Bay Berries and Juniper Berries, of each two drams: Castoreum, one dram: being
cut and bruised, boil them in fresh Oil olive, half a pound: old Wine, three
ounces: boil them to the consumption of the Wine; strain by Expression, and
then add Oil of Nutmegs by Expression two drams: Oil of Amber and Rosemary, of
each one dram.

28. This Liniment was continued for some days with advantage, both internal
and external Corroboratives being prescribed on the precedent days; but we
desinging a further Dissipation of the peccant matter; we did exhibit with
success seven grains of the Bezoar-stone with two ounces of Pauls-Betony
diligently prepared.

29. After the Administration of these things, he had several indicative signs
of Recovery; such as convenient Sleep, an Appetite to meats, and a good
Concoction; then we succored nature by good Diet; and thought it also
necessary to apply to the backbone which was very much debilitated an
Emplaister of Oxycroceum, for strengthening the nervous and musculous parts, by
the use of which she grew pretty well, and the strength of the Nerves and
Muscles did return by little and little.

30. Yet there was some weakness in the Joints all the next Winter, therefore
we ordered her to repair the next Spring to the Baths, which were used for the
space of three weeks according to our directions, a gentle Evacuation being
first taken for the space of four days, of the following laxative Wine.

31. Take the Roots of Elecampane, Fennel, Pimpernel, of each half an ounce:
Liquorish, Polypody, of each six drams: Mechoacan, two drams: Leaves of choice
Sena, one ounce: Agarick, half an ounce: Rhubarb, one dram and half: Sage,
Rosemary, of each one dram: the Seeds of Anise, and Fennel, of each a dram:
Mace, Ginger, Cinnamon, of each one scruple: mix them and make a Bag.

32, By these things this illustrious Maid was restored to perfect Health, and
was never afterward troubled with the like Distemper. Georgius Horstius, Tom.
2. Lib. 1. Observe. 18.

LXIII. A Disposition to a Convulsion by consent of the spleen and the
adjoining parts.

1, A noble Woman in the Dukedom of Wurtemberg, about the age of four and
twenty, did complain of a daily Compression and straitness of her Breast; with
an Inflammation of the Hypochondria, a vehement pain of the Stomach and
perpetual obstructions of the Belly.

2. It happened that for many years this person felt in the external parts a
convulsive kind of pain, like the running over quickly of Pismires, whom also
as it were an unmoveableness and stiffness of the Joints did seize; insomuch
that at length the motions of the parts were impeded, with a spontaneous
weariness of the whole Body and an Eclipse of the Mind.

3. As to the curative Indications we ought to have respect to the preventing
and extirpating the peccant matter, that the root and sink of the Evil may not
be increased.

4. Secondly that the same matter may be corrected after the most convenient
way.

5. For the first a good order and method of Diet is to be observed, and the
circumambient Air should be moderately hot; first of all defend the Head,
Hands, and Feet from the cold; and shun all cold, cloudy, rainy weather, and
southerly winds; at which time it will be convenient to use in the Chamber a
fumigation of the wood and berries of Juniper, Mastick, Olibanum, Amber, and
the like.

6. The obstructions of the Belly to which the sick is inclinable may be
removed by Broths of Damask Pruins sweetened with sugar, rear-eggs made ready
with Butter, a Ptisan made of Barley husked, the broth of Beets, of red Ciches;
and a bird called Solitarius, or the Yolks of Eggs with a spoonful of sugar and
the like, all which are to be taken a little before other Meats.

7. But if such like kitchen Medicines avail nothing, you may take, two hours
before dinner and supper, six drams of the Electuary of Tamarinds, with the
leaves and tops of Sena, either by its self or dissolved in some of the
aforesaid Broths, for the same reason one dram of the Cream of Tartar may be
conveniently given.

8 As to food, the flesh of Swine and Cows if it be old is to be avoided, as
also Meats of more difficult digestion.

9. Under this prohibition we may include Fish of all sorts, except Perches,
Gudgion and other Fish among the stony and rocky places; Milk and things made
of it, unripe Fruits, Mustard, Garlic, and Onions, etc. are not to be used.

10. You must content your self with a few things, as Veal, Weathers-flesh,
Hens, Capons, Fowls of the Mountains, Spinach, Beets, Apples neither too sweet
nor sour, Damascens, and such like.

11. You may make ready and season those Fleshes with Sage, Thyme, Marjoram,
and Rosemary, Caraway seeds, Fennel and Capars.

12. For drink in the beginning of your meal this physical Wine will be
convenient; into which there may be infused some of the root Elecampane,
Cloves, Peony with the leaves of Hart's-tongue, Betony and Rosemary, etc.

13. As to the correction of the peccant matter, it may be affected by
appropriate Medicines; first therefore we order a laxative Wine to be taken for
eight days: Take the Roots of Peony, Valerian, Swallowwort, Madder, of each
half an ounce: Scorzonera, Polypody, of each six drams: the Bark of Ash,
dwarf-Elder, Elder, of each one dram: the Leaves of Sena, ten drams: Rhubarb,
two drams and half: Agarick, Mechoacan, of each two drams: the Flowers of
Peaches, Acacia, of each three drams: the Leaves of Centaury the lesser,
Scordium, Hore-hound, Fumitory, of each half an handful: Carthamus-seeds, two
drams: Cream of Tartar, two drams and half: Galangal, Zedoary, of each one
dram: cut and bruise them, and then put them into a Bag; which is to be steeped
four and twenty hours in two quarts of Wine.

14. This with an empty Stomach let them take either five or six ounces alone,
or with half a dram of Cream of Tartar, whereby the first ways or passages and
the more proximate mesericaks may be purified.

15. The way being prepared thus, we shall the more expeditiously penetrate to
the root of the Malady and that by a convenient digestion, which may be done by
taking half a dram of the following powder either in Wine of Hart's-tongue or
Wormwood.

16. Take Cream of Tartar, one ounce and an half: Magistry of Tartar
vitriolated, one dram and half: red Coral, one dram: Fecula Aronis, Briony, of
each one dram and half: Salt of Wormwood, Carduus Benedictus, of each four
scruples: mix them, and let it be given in two Doses.

17. Then let this proper purgative be given after this digestion: Take
Magistry of Tartar vitriolated, one dram: Diagridium with the Oil of Fennel
prepared, four grains, mix them and make a Powder, Georgius Horstius. Tom. 2.
Lib. 12. Observe, 44.

LXIV. A Convulsion in a married Woman,

1. A certain married Woman was much afflicted with Convulsions, not much
unlike the former we have already mentioned, with these she also labored
under, first a trembling and then a shaking of her members, which trembling was
first felt in the extreme parts.

2. Presently by communication the Arms appeared convulsed, whereupon followed
a Dispnaea, with a contraction of the back and the whole body, and which is
very wonderful all this was without any pain, unless when the Paroxysm was
remitted, all the parts were exceedingly wearied.

3. Her Urine was such that by its crudity there seemed to be an obstruction of
the Viscera of the second concoction; therefore I had respect to the first ways
or passages that they by little and little might be purged, and then to such
Remedies as should open those latent and hidden obstructions, digest the
peccant matter, and strengthen the Head and nervous System.

4. We began the Cure by this following laxative Wine: Take Roots of Peony,
Swallowwort, of each half an ounce: the five Openers, one dram and half: Roots
of Elecampane, Scorzonera, of each three drams: the Leaves of Scordium,
Hoar-hound, Fumitory, Hearts Tongue, Ceterach, Betony, of each half an handful:
the Leaves of Sena, one ounce and half: Rhubarb, one dram and half: the Bark of
the roots of black Alder, Esula, of each two drams: the Tops of Elder gathered
in the Spring, half an handful: the Flowers of Elder, of Peaches, of each three
pugils: the Seeds of red Ciches, six dram: Fennel, one dram: Galangal,
Sassafras, of each half a dram: Cinnamon, one dram: Currants, ten drams: Cream
of Tartar, one dram and half: make an Infusion in six pound of Rhenish-Wine;
let them stand four and twenty hours: and afterward let her take for the space
of eight days half a pint thereof every day with a fasting Stomach.

5. This being premised we endeavored in the next place to open further those
hidden obstructions; to digest the peccant matter, and to strengthen the Head
and Genus nervosum.

6. Take Roots of Swallowwort, Elecampane, Cloves, Peony, of each half an
ounce: the leaves of Betony, Sage, of each one handful: S^aechas-flowers,
Rosemary-flowers, of each half an handful: Species Deanthos, Plires
Archonticon, of each half a dram: Diagalangal, Calamus Aromaticus, Cloves, of
each one scruple: Sugar, to the weight of them all: make a Powder.

7. We gave every day in the morning one dram of this Powder in a draught of
Sage and Rosemary Wine, which we continued for the space of fourteen days, not
omitting appropriated Evacuations which were exhibited in the intermediate days.

8. Outwardly we advised a fomentation to be used with the spirits of Wine,
wherein was infused Castoreum, Myrrh, Bay Berries, Juniper Berries, the leaves
of Sage, Rosemary, Betony, Rosemary flowers, Primroses, Lavender, and the like.

9. We also ordered the Backbone to be often anointed with the Oil of
Earthworms, Oil of Castoreum, Oil of Foxes and of Orrise, etc.

10. The drink was Beer well purged from its faeces, in which was infused the
roots of Cloves and Elecampane; the leaves of Rosemary, Betony, Sage, with
Bay Berries, Nut-meg, Cinnamon, Cloves, etc. By which Remedies and the blessing
of God upon them, this most grievous and vehement symptom was remitted to that
degree, that the sick never afterward complained. Georgius Horstius, Tom, 2.
lib. 2. Observe. 44.

LXV. A Convulsion in the exream Parts.

1. A certain Reverend Parson was afflicted with a most grievous pain about his
Neck and Shoulders, which at length vexed greatly his left Knee, and then
together with a sudden tumor, immediately relinquishing this place; they seized
another, to wit, the right Knee.

2. Also the Arms, Hands and Legs alternately were swelled with these kind of
wandering pains; yet all this was without any intemperature of the Visera, or
loss of appetite.

3. This person having implored the help of a worthy Physician called Cornelius
Thaureus, because I was absent; Evacuation being first premised, he ordered the
following drink to be taken daily, to wit, a physical Wine which is as follows.

4. Take Succory roots, one ounce: Swallowwort, Cloves, of each half an ounce:
Endive Peony, of each two drams: Betony leaves, Maidenhair, gout Ivy,
Primroses, both root and herb, of each one handful: the flowers of Rosemary,
Sage, Time, of each half an handful: the leaves of Carduus Benedictus, one
handful: cut them after a gross manner for this physical Wine.

5. Moreover he ordered the daily use of the convulsive powder, which was after
this manmer prescribed: Take the roots of Swallow-wort, Sarsa-parilla, Endive,
Cloves, of each two drams: Peony, Bay Berries, of each one dram: the powder
Rosemary, Sage, Time, of each half a dram: species plires Archonticon,
Diamoschi Amari, Dianthos, of each one scruple: make a powder.

6. The quantity of one dram of this powder being taken every day in the
Morning; as also sweat being oft-times provoked and continued for a week or
two; those most violent pains and tumors of the External parts were thereby so
much discussed, that afterward by these few strengthening Medicines the
Patient was even restored to the vigor of his former health. Georgius
Herstius, Tom. 2. lib. 2. Observe. 45. page 118.

LXVI. A Convusion in another person.

1. I see no cause, why I should change my opinion concerning the use of that
powder which is already mentioned, But it should be gently boiled in the whey
of Goats-milk or in the milk it self.

2. It will be convenient to take two drams of the convulsive powder, with
Conserves of Betony and flowers of of Peony, of each one ounce: which put
together into a clean Rag; the milk or posset being seethed over a gentle fire
is to be frequently instilled; by which you shall recover strength and allay
the vehemence of the Disease.

3. To Anoint also the Backbone twice or thrice a day with the Oil, I have
above commended, cannot but be very profitable. Georgius Horstius, lib. 2.
Observe. 45.

LXVII. Convulsions by consent from the Womb.

1. A Gentlewoman did complain that she had for above half a year felt a
torturing pain in the Womb; a wind arising from the left Hypochondria with
pain, the Arms and Mouth being also convulsed.

2. First a decent and proper Diet being ordered, I advised the following
things: Take species Hiera Simplex, half a dram: Castoreum, assa Faetidae, of
each half a scruple: Ammoniacum, Opopanax, of each fifteen grains: Galbanum,
five grains: Cinnamon, half a scruple: Saffron, four grains: mix them with the
water of Mugwort, make Pills number twenty five and guild them, take five or
six at once, and let them be repeated every eight day.

3. Afterward with the following water you may use this bagg: Take the
Faeculae of Briony, one scruple: the salt of Mugwort, half a scruple: mix them;
put them up into a paper for one dose, and to be continued so for five doses.

4. Take water of Mugwort, Pennyroyal, of each three ounces: Cinnamon, one
ounce: mix them.

5. This following Emplaster is to be applie^ also and to be carried always on
the Navel: Take Emplaster of Galbanum, six drams: the Magnet reduced into a
powder, mix them and malax them with the Oil of Castoreum, and make a plaster,
to be spread on Leather; by the help of these she was free from all fear or
fits of this Disease for the space of two years. Georgius Horstius, Tom. 2.
lib. 2. Observe. 50.

LXVIII. A Convulsion in another person.

1. It Is necessary I give rules for diet; your meat must be such as affords a
good Chyle, and is easy of concoction, as Mutton, Veal, Goats-flesh, Hens,
Cocks, Capons, Partridges, all wild-fowls, etc. of Corns, Wheat, Barley, and
Oat-meal, of Fruits, Apples, Pears, Damescens, and others both boiled and
otherways dressed.

2. Of Herbs, these following are good, Sage, Time, and Mother of Time, Hyssop,
Pennyroyal, Marjoram, Rosemary, Mint, Origanum, Savory, also Fennel, Cumin,
Dill, Mugwort, Beet, Spinach Blit, sometimes Turnip, Skirrets, fresh Eggs and
Butter, with good Broths, pure Wine and Beer, clear and not too strong.

3. Sleep must not be presently after meat, nor in the day time; neither must
violent motions or exercises be used after eating; these rules being carefully
observed, we must then endeavor to eradicate the pestilent and malignant
matter.

4. And first according to the measure of strength you must make use of a
specific Electuary two or three days, you may take the quantity of half an
ounce thereof; and about four hours after and in the Evening you may take Broth
wherein is a little Rosemary, Mother of Time, Savory or Sage.

5. After this purge, the following remedies may be used alternately for a
whole month, and after the first Evacuation of the Body, if perhaps the Cure
commences in the New Mood, let them take every day for five or six days one
dram of the convulsive powder.

6. After this, on the sixth or seventh day, and indeed the next after the
first quarter of the Moon, they must take again half an ounce of the said
purgative Electuary, then let them continue the convulsive powder to the time
of full-Moon.

7. Which being done, let them repeat the same quantity of the Electuary; and
so let them proceed to the third week, or to the new Moon, until the malady is
in some good measure remitted and the Members by renewed strength appear more
brisk and lively.

8. Which being effected, they may desist from the constant use of Remedies;
yet they may reassume one dram of the convulsive powder, a little before the
new. Moon, but chiefly in Winter about the months of December and January.

9. And let them cause Sweat, by taking a sufficient quantity of Treacle, and
sometimes for strengthening of the Members, let them chew of Peony roots,
Elecampane, Sage, Rue, Juniper Berries, Cummin, etc.

10. As to the affected Members and the comforting of them, It will be
convenient that once every day the whole Marrow of the Backbone from the first
Vertebra of the Neck to the last Vertebra of the Os Sacrum be well anointed
with one or the other of these Oils, to wit, the Oils of Foxes, sweet Almonds,
Earthworms, Castoreum, etc.

11. Or if these cannot be had, then make use of Goose or Hens grease, or the
Marrow in the bones of a Calf, the Sewet of Mutton or the Fat of a Calf; one or
the other of these following being mixed therewith, as Earthworms, Castoreum,
Cammomil flowers, Rosemary, Dill, Origanum; Savory, Mother of Time, Primroses,
Rue, a little Wine or broth of Hens being added, they being all boiled to the
consumption of the Wine or Broth: make a liniment for the whole Back bone.

12. But if any person should find any great tumor or pain about the region of
the Spleen and Liver or any other part of the Body; let him take some of the
above mentioned herbs and boil them in Wine for a fomentation, and afterward
anoint the part well, and moreover the Members that are oftenest afflicted with
convulsive motions, especially after sweating should be gently rubbed with warm
clothes.

13. And afterward let him bath with spirit of wine, in which are infused for
a Night the flowers of Primroses, Lavender, Rue, Sage, Betony or Castoreum it
self.

14. Or the said spirit of Wine may be mixed with the distilled water of
Lavender, for which purpose let him always wear Gloves and Shoo's made of
Wolf's or Cats-skins; the continual use of which is good for preserving the
Members in their due strength.

15. And if the Feet require it, you may prepare a Bath of Betony, Mother of
Time, Primroses and Cammomil, the Feet being bathed therein, you may gently rub
them dry with a warm cloth.

16. But if all these means should not be sufficient, then Issues are to be
made both in Legs and Arms, which are to be kept open until the malady be
discernably remitted; But if this Evil be not yet eradicated, then he must
repair unto the natural Baths. Georgius Horstius, lib. 8. cap. 6.

LXIX. Of those who are in the Paroxysm.

1. If any should be suddenly taken with Convulsions and held in the Paroxysm,
immediately after he has felt the pain running over his Hands and Feet, let him
rub the affected Member with the spirit of wine, above mentioned, and extend
the parts contracted and bow the members that are distorted.

2. But if the vellication does not yet cease, then ligatures are to be made
use of toward the parts afflicted.

3. If the hand, for example sake be grived, then the ligature is to be in the
Arm, between the Elbow and Shoulder; if the Foot or Leg be afflicted, then the
ligature is to be applied to the Thigh, between the huckle-bone and the Knee;
and the part affected is to be kept tied, till the malignant vapor and the
sense of pain shall altogether vanish away.

4. And if the vellication and pricking should longer continue, then the
ligature may be sometimes loosned, whereby the member may more liberally receive
the blood and the enlivening spirit; which being done, let him presently bind
on the ligature, and so let him proceed alternately, until there be a remission
which pain and vellication at length ceasing, he may unbind the Ligature.

5. This being done, let him take one dram of the convulsive powder, or half an
ounce of the counvulsive Antidote, well dissolved in a little broth, for
defending the Brain and principal members, and dissipating the venomous vapors
in the same.

6. But if that malignant humor give him so long thruce as to lie in Bed, then
he may if strength will permit, cover himself well with coverings till he
sweat, and so those vapors by insensible transpiration be evaporated.

7. These Remedies are to be alternatly reiterated even till a total
intermission of the Disease and pain; which being done, let him the next day
take for a purge half an ounce of the purging Electuary: Observing all things
exactly according to former prescriptions. Georgius Horstius, lib. 8. cap. 7.

LXX. Other universal remedies designed for the cure of this Disease.

1. Of these there are chiefly three, to wit, the purging convulsive Electuary,
the convulsive Antidote, and the convulsive Powder.

2. The first, viz. the puging convulsive Electuary is this: Take Diaphaenicum
Solidum, four ounces: the Electuary of the juice of Roses, two ounces: and
half: the convulsive Antidote, or Treacle here described, two ounces: the
powder of Hermodacts cleansed from the upmost Bark, Turpentine, Esula, of each
one dram: Diagrydium, Castoreum, of each two scruples: Ginger, Costus, Cloves,
of each one scruple: the seeds of Rue Cummin, Crocus, of each half a scruple:
mix them and with the syrup of Roses solutive make an Electuary.

3. The convulsive Antidote: Take the root^ Peony, Misleto, of each two ounces:
Castoreum, Sage, of each two ounces: Bay Berries, Mans-skull burnt, of each two
drams: Treacle of Alexandria, choice Mithridate, of each twelve ounces:
clarified Honey, two pound: mix them for a Treacle Electuary.

4. The convulsive powder: Take the powder of the roots of Swallow wort,
Elecampane, Devills-bite, Avens, Peony, of each one ounc^ and half:
Bay Berries, half an ounce: the tops of Sage, Mother of time, Rosemary-flowers,
of each two drams: Species Diamoschi Dulcis, Plirisarconticon, Dianthos, of
each one dram: mix them, and make a powder.

5. After this manner have we delineated the convulsive Disease, with its cure;
and we have by experience found that the above named Remedies has given such
abundant help to Nature, that this stubborn dangerous Disease has been overcome
and all its symptoms vanished. Georgius Horstius, lib. 8. cap. 9.

LXXI. These following things are also good for the Convulsion.

1. Make a fomentation of the leaves and flowers of the Tile-tree boiled in
Wine; after the fomentation, take for anointing the parts the Oil of Line-seed,
Goose-grease, mixed with the Oil of Cinnamon, the Oil of Earthworms, mixed
with Turpentine: Take the Oil of Cammomil, one ounce: of Earthworms, half an
ounce: Castoreum, the powder of Earthworms, of each half a dram: mix them.

2. Treacle dissolved in the Oil of Scorpions and Castoreum is of good use, if
the distemper proceed from a cold Cause. Gregorius Horstius, vol. 3. lib. 2.
cap.

LXXII. A Convulsion in a certain Matron.

1. A certain Matron was for some days afflicted with horrible fits of a
Convulsion, accompanied with a kind of foolishness: her body was sometimes so
im^etuously shaken that scarsly two of the strongest men could hold her.

2. I having observed that she loathed all kind of Medicaments, I advised that
her Husband who had been for some time absent, should be called, and her
Members which had been for some days shaken and wasted to be anointed with the
following Ointment:

3. Take the Oil of the flowers of Slotanus, one ounce: the Oil of Earthworms,
of Foxes, of Camomil, of Lillies and white Roses, of each half an ounce: and
mix them.

4. From that time I never knew that she was ever taken with convulsive fits or
other Diseases all the time she lived with her Husband, who was a Physician.
Fabritij Hildani, cent. 6. Observe. Chururg: 26.

LXXIII. Convulsions considred in general.

1. A Convulsion is two fold, either universal or particular; an universal
Convulsion is threefold, either the Head and whole Body is contracted and
drawn to the Breast: or the Head, Neck and the rest of the Body is convulsed
and drawn to the hinder parts and Back: or the whole remains immovable and
inflexible to either part.

2. A particular Convulsion is only that which seises one part.

3. This Disease either proceeds from repletion, or emptiness or from the
putrid malignant Vapors elevated to the Brain, and the original of the Nerves.

4. All Convulsions are dangerous, but particularly that which proceeds from
emptiness; the Nerves being too much dried by immoderate Purgations, vomits, a
burning Fever, etc. cannot be easily moistened or humected and oft-times the
strength is loosened and destroyed by the sharpness of the Disease before the
Nerves can recover their former Humectation and be reduced to some good temper.

5. Wherefore Hippocrates did rightly pronounce a convulsion from Hellebor, to
be deadly, because of the immoderate Evacuation, which also an incurable
siccity and dryness does follow.

6. The same Author affirms that a Convulsion occasioned by a wound is also
incurable because of the hurting and inflammation of the Nervous parts, by which
great pain comes, which by consent grievously afflicts the Brain.

7. A Convulsion from Malignant and venomous vapors is no less dangerous: For
by them the Brain is not only afflicted, but also the Heart to which the
vapors are carried by the Arteries.

8. In the cure of this Disease the cause is to be looked to: If the Convulsion
proceed from repletion, according to Hippocrates, it requires evacuation;
wherefore a good Diet is to be instituted, the Body is to be Purged and a vein
is to be opened, and the part affected and the whole marrow of the Backbone is
to be anointed with the following Ointment.

9. Take Oil of Earthworms, of Foxes, of each two ounces: Oil of Turpentine,
of Wax, of Castoreum, of each half an ounce: Man's grease, three ounces: juice
of Earthworms, one ounce: mix them and apply them hot.

10. But if the Distemper proceed from inanition and siccity, purgative
Medicine and blood letting must be avoided; and meats that are moistning or
humecting, and nutritive must be used.

11. If the Patients thirst be great, then the following potion may be
exhibited: Take the water of Bugloss, Roses and Violets, of each four oun^^s:
syrup of Violets, four ounces: mix them and make a Julep, which the sick may
take as often as he pleases.

12. Emulsions of the cold seeds and the Milk of sweet Almonds are very
agreeable, as also the Conserves of Violets, the flowers of Water Lillies,
Nenuphar and Borrage.

13. If the Belly be not in good temper, you may administer a Clyster, let it
be such a one as is both emollient and nutritive, made of the broth of Mutton,
Capons and Hens, with the Yolks of four Eggs, and a little of the powder of
Saffron, Mace and Cinnamon Water.

14. The part affected and the marrow of the Back is to be anointed with the
following things: Take Man's fat, the Oil of Violets and sweet-Almonds, of each
two ounces: the juice of Earthworms, three ounces: mix and apply them warm.

15. If the Convulsion be by consent, that is to say, if it proceed from pain,
inflammation and tumefacton, then the pain is to be assuaged, the inflammation
is to be extinguished, and the tumefaction of the Member is to be resolved and
dissipated; in which Case the following Ointment is agreeable even to a
wonderful manner.

16. Take Oil of Sage, Dill, Cammomil, Foxes, the juice of Earthworms, Man's
grease, of each two ounces: Oil of Turpentine, Aqua vitae, of each one ounce:
Saffron, one dram: mix them and make a Liniment.

17. Ambrosius Paraeus who deserves eternal Encomiums, does exceedingly commend
the following Liniment to be used in Diseases of the Nerves, chiefly those
which arises from a cold cause: Take Sage, Ground Pine, Marjoram, Rosemary,
Rue, Lavender, of each one handful: the flowers of Cammomil, Melilot,
Dill-Hypericon, of each two pugils: Bay and Juniper Berries, of each two
ounces: the roots of Pyrethrum, two drams: Mastick, Benjamin, of each one ounce
and half: Turpentine, one pound: Oil of Earthworms, Dill, and Whelps, of each
six ounces: Oil of Turpentine, three ounces: Mans-grease, two ounces: Crocus,
one dram: white Wine, one pound and half: Wax a sufficient quantity, bruise
those that are to be bruised, and pulverise those that are to be pulverized,
afterward let them be boiled in a double vessel with the several Oils and
grease above mentioned, and then make a Liniment according to Art, adding in
the end three ounces of Aqua vitae.

18. But if the Convulsion proceed from evil and malignant vapors, afflicting
the Brain and other noble parts: the digestion and suppuration of the Wound
must be accelerated, and although cold defensitives impede the Elevation of the
vapors, yet because they retard the suppuration of the wound and ^urt the
Nerves, they are not to be used but with great judgment.

19. This one thing I shall add, that to those Liniments which are applied to
the Wound there be always added some Treacle, Mithridate, and the Bezoar stone.

20. Mithridate, also Treacle, the Bezoar-stone Hartshorn and other
Alexipharmacks, taken in at the Mouth, does agree very well; an Epithem is to
be applied to the region of the Heart, as also to his Wrists. Fabritius
Hildanus, de Gangrena, cap 26.

LXXIV. A Convulsion in a fat Man.

1. A man fat, thick and phlegmatic about the age of five and thirty, having
after supper a great pain in his Head, was suddenly taken with an universal
Convulsion through his whole Body, insomuch that I never before had seen the
like.

2. For his Legs and Arms were not only convulsed, but also the muscles of his
Breast, yea a most violent Convulsion had seized the whole Body; he lay
speechless, with his Mouth shut; if he had been pricked, there followed a
contraction of the Hands and Feet; but he had some Sense, so that it did not
appear to be an Apoplexy.

3. This Fit continued two whole days, and three nights till Death gave him a
Quietus est.

4. Coming to him at night, I ordered Frictions and Ligatures, and having by an
Artifice opened his Mouth, I ordered Oxymel to be put into his Mouth, as also a
sharp Clyster to be injected.

5. In this difficult Case I did press earnestly for consultation with
Cornelius Ericius my Colleague, whose Sentiments of the Disease, and of the
Necessity of the Clyster which was prepared was the same with mine.

6. We agreed in giving him for a gentle Purge (for he was very phlegmatic)
one dram and half of Pil. Cochiae, dissolved in a little Sage-Water, by this he
had three stools; yet he continued as he was.

7. At night, returning again, we anointed the whole Nape and the whole
Backbone with the Oil of Turpentine, mixed with the Oil of Foxes; and we did
exhibit again Pil. Cochiae; but was nothing the better.

8. Afterward the following Sternutatory was prescribed: Take white Hollebore,
black Pepper, Staves acre, of each one scruple and half: beat them into a fine
Powder, and then by a Quill put it up into the Nostrils.

9. But this also did no good, for it did not cause Sneezing, which without
Controversy was a mortal Sign; at the same time his Teeth being opened a little
of the following Compound was poured into his Mouth very often.

10. Take the Conserve of the Flowers of Rosemary, one ounce: Mithridate, half
an ounce: choice Treacle, three drams: Oxymel simple, and Squills, of each half
an ounce; Syrup of Staechas, half an ounce: mix them; neither was any thing the
better by this, for he dyed the third night. Petrus Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe.
103.

LXXV. A Convulsion arising from a pain in the Joints.

1. A certain noble Woman having a long time kept her Chamber by pains in the
Joints; and growing thereby phlegmatic, she was sadly afflicted almost every
year with the Gout; and at length the pituitous matter being imbibed in the
Nerves, she had a mighty Convulsion.

2. Among many things we prescribed for Diet, this one thing we thought
convenient to be taken in stead of Wine, viz, a kind of Mead, made of the
Decoction of Marjoram, Sage, Betony with a little Cinnamon and Honey.

3. We did commend frictions of the Vertebrae and Neck, and that she would
avoid all perturbations of the mind; and to keep the Body always in a good
Temper; we ordered for her the following Clyster: Take roots of Marshmallows,
white Lillies, of each half an ounce: Sage, Betony, Hysop, Rue, of each one
handful: the Flowers of Carduus Benedictus, Rosemary, Cammomil, Centaury the
lesser, Herb Mercury, of each one handful and half: Staechas, one pugil:
Carthamus-seed, half an ounce: Caraway and Fennel-seed, one dram and half:
Polyp^dy, half an ounce: Bran, one pugil: white Agarick, one dram and half:
boil them all together in common Water; to one pound of the straining I add
Benedictum laxativum, half an ounce: Electuary of Hiera Picra, three drams: Oil
of Lillies, Oil of Cammomil, of each one ounce and half: with a little Salt
make a Clyster.

4. But if this will not do because of the hardness of the Belly, I would
advise a more emollient Clyster of the Decoction of Mallows and Marshmallows,
etc.

5. The minoration of the pituitous matter being made by Pil. Hierae simplex;
we endeavored for the better Evacuation of the same to render the matter more
thin and fluxile by Syrups made of the Decoction of Sage, Marjoram,
Ground Pine, Germander, Hysop, and the like, the Syrup of Staechas, Honey of
Roses, and the Syrup of Betony being added.

6. First for Purgation we exhibited these following Pills: Take Pills of
Assajaret and Agarick trochiscated, of each half a dram: with Honey of Roses
make seven Pills.

7. Let her take afterward the following Apozem: Take the bark of the roots of
Barsley, Fennel, Butchers-Broom, Asparagus, of each half an ounce: the Flowers
of Rosemary, one pugil: Hysop, Marjoram, Sage, Germander, Ground Pine, Betony,
of each one handful: Annise and Fennel, one dram and half: Carthamus-seeds,
half an ounce: Polypody of the Oak, one ounce: Time, one pugil: make a
Decoction in water; to one pound of the straining you may add Syrup of
Staechas, Calamint, Honey of Roses strained, of each one ounce: aromatize it
with a little Cinnamon, Mace, and Nutmeg: and let it be after the manner of a
Claret.

8. I did purge her again with the following Pills: Take Pil. Faetidae,
Cochiae, Pil. Hermodactylis, of each one scruple: Castoreum, three grains: make
seven Pills.

9. And after I had used dry Cupping-glases with Scarification in the shoulder
blades and hipps, we then made use of Masticatories and Apophlegmatisms; for
these not only divert but also draw the matter from the Head and hinder the
Defluction thereof from the Brain to the Nape and Vertebrae: Treacle,
Mithridate, Diamoschi, Conserve of the Flowers of Sage and Rosemary were taken;
and outwardly the Backbone, as also the other convulsed Members were first
anointed with the Oil of Foxes and Earthworms, then with the Oil of Costus and
an Ointment made of Bdellum; rolling all up in the skin of a Wolf.

10. The Members were for some time kept in a Decoction of Whelps in Wine and
Oil.

11, And that Experiment of Nicholas which resolves and remits the pain was not
neglected; Take a fat Goose, open it and throw away the Garbish, and after you
have put into the Belly thereof a Cat cut in small pieces with Lard, Myrrh, and
Frankincense; sow it up; putting it on a Spit, which roast, then set a Dish
under it wherein is Vinegar; in which the first Fat dropping, was laid aside;
but that which distilled afterward was reserved for Use.

12. Let the Goose after this be boiled in the said Vinegar, and the greatest
part of the Fat will be separated, and will swim above the Vinegar, which being
mixed with the first, anoin^ therewith the convulsed Members.

13. I have known some to be freed from pain by using only a Bath of common Oil
with a Decoction of Earthworms; but the Members must be contained within the
hot Oil, and a Plaster of Earthworms must be applied to the affected Parts.

14. Caesar Landulphus said he was cured by Cats-mint, common Oil, Worms, and
the Oil of F^xes; although he had a Convulsion in his Hipps and Legs; it
returning about half a year after, was presently well by taking Sarsa-Parilla.
Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 104.

LXXVI. A Convulsion in an old Man.

1. A certain old man of Delf, having a Convulsion in his Neck and Arm, I
exhibited to him Pil. Cochiae with a small quantity of Castoreum, afterward I
gave him Pil. Cochiae and Fetidae; and his Neck also being anointed with the
Oil of Lillies, Earthworms, and Foxes, this old Man recovered even to a
Miracle.

2. Also another sick Person was freed from Convulsions thus; a Vein was
opened, then a Decoction was made of Sage, Betony, Marjoram, Staechas, and the
like; to which was added also Syrup of Staechas; and the Pills above mentioned
were exhibited, then Errhins and cephalic Purges were administered.

3. After this we came to use Topics; first anointing the parts with Oil of
Lillies and Cammomil, and then for greater Discussion we proceeded to the use
of the Oils of Rue, Bays, Orris, Ducks and Goose grease, and at length of
Petroleum; a little Aqua Vitae being added, as also a little of the Powder of
Castoreum, with Marshmallows and Martiatum. Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 106.

LXXVII. A Convulsion from too great Repletion of the pituitous Juice.

1. A Man drowsy and phlegmatic, every day filling himself with thick Beer; and
living a very idle life; being about the age of forty, fell suddenly into a
Convulsion of the Arms and Legs.

2. Having understood by several Causes and Signs that his Convulsions
proceeded from too great plenty of the pituitous Juice or Humors; I ordered
that according to Celsus, he should keep a continual Fire in his Chamber, it
being cold Weather, which does certainly offend the Parts.

3. I took care that the Belly was kept in a good Temper; the Cream of Ptisan
was ordered for him as a Diet, as also rear Eggs, Chickens, or a Broth in which
Hysop, the Mother of Time, Sage, Elder, Savory were boiled.

4. I praescribed to him a Clyster, which having purged him sufficiently, I
ordered him to use twice a day continually the following Decoction: Take Sage,
Marjoram, Cowslipps, Betony, Bay Leaves, the flowers of Rosemary, and Staechas,
of each one handful: make a Decoction in Aqua Mulsa, for one pint.

5. Afterward I purged him with the following Pills: Take Pil. Cochiae, and
Fetidae, and of Agarick, of each one scruple: with Betony water make five
Pills; after the purge of Actius, I did exhibit one dram of Castoreum with
Sage-Water.

6. After one or two days, (his Head being purged again with Errhines and
Apophlegmatisms) I ordered one dram of choice Treacle with two ounces of Aqua
Mulsa.

7. And I anointed his Neck, Backbone, and the inferior Vertebrae, with the
Oil of Spike, of Costus, and Castoreum, the Oil of Pepper, and Earthworms; by
which Remedies he was at length cured. Petrus Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 107.

LXXVIII. A Convulsion from outrageous Choler.

1. One dwelling in the City of Delf, who was intemperate and a great Feeder,
fell under the Praedominancy of fierce and sharp Choler by reason of continual
Crudities; being taking with a violent Griping and Evacuation, as well above as
below; he fell into swooning Fits, which brought him into a Convulsion of the
Hands and Feet, and a Contraction almost of all the Muscles.

2. For the Muscles of his Breast, Throat, Neck, Back, and Belly were so
convulsed, that every one that saw him, looked upon him as one just ready to
expire; for subduing of this stubborn Malady I proposed the following Drink for
cleansing the Ventricle from that sharp and gnawing Humor.

3. Take the Decoction of Barley not husked, three ounces: Syrup of the
manifold Infusion of red Roses, one ounce: mix them:

4. By this he vomited up many choleric humors; and had several watery Stools.

5. For his swooning, his Face was often sprinkled with Water, and Wine was
often held to him to smell at; Frictions were also used; afterward both for
repressing the Impetuosity of Choler, Vomiting and Looseness, as also his great
Thirst and frequent Swooning: Take Rob de Ribes, two ounces: Rob of Cherries,
Syrup of Quinces, of each one ounce: Lozenges of Sugar pearled, one ounce and
half: mix them.

6. For those Contractions and Convulsions of the Muscles, I ordered that the
Calves of the Legs and the Muscles of the Breast should be anointed with the
following Liniment: Take of the Oil of Orrice, of the Oil of Earthworms, of
each two ounces: Castoreum pulverized, four scruples: mix them; by the use of
this with strong Frictions those Contractions were greatly abated.

7. When we saw the Distemper in the declinature, we strengthened and nourished
him with Milk of sweet Almonds with a little Bean-Water, at length we recovered
him by good Diet.

8. But when the former Symptoms had ceased he was yet troubled with a Thirst,
and after two or three days his Belly was so much bound that he could not go to
stool; therefore I ordered him to take every Morning one spoonful of the Syrup
of the Infusion of Roses, which had so good Effect that he got once every day a
stool, and was delivered from his immoderate Heat and Thirst.

9. Having sometime after a pain in the bottom of his Belly, it was anointed
with the Oil of Cammomil, and so the pain did vanish, and he did make water
plentifully and grew well. Petrus F ^^stus, Lib. 10. Observe. 110.

LXXIX. A Convulsion of the Nerves of the Neck.

1. A certain Widow of Delf, about the age of fifty six, of a strong
constitution, falling into this Disease; we took from her eight ounces of Blood
out of the middle Vein of the right Arm, and when we had set her Rules for
Diet; we did cause her Neck which was very stiff to be anointed with the Oil of
Orris and Cammomil, and then to be covered with wool dipped in the Oils.

2. Afterward we ordered her the following potion: Take green Betony two
handfuls: Fumetory, one handful: boil them in a sufficient quantity of Betony
water, and then take four ounces of the straining, syrup of Stachas, one ounce:
syrup of Betony, half an ounce mix them.

3. At Night she appeared to be a little feverish, which we looked upon to be
a good sign, according as we find in Aphor. 57. lib. 4. a Fever coming upon a
Convulsion, does deliver the sick therefrom.

4, On the second she found some ease in her Neck; and because she complained
of heat, in the place of the syrup of Betony we mixed syrup of Violets with the
preceding syrup; and then exhibited the following purging decoction: Take Sage
Betony, Fumitory, Violets, of each one handful: Annis-seed, one dram and half:
Raisons stoned, one ounce: Damasens, number seven; leaves of Senna, six drams:
Agarick trochiscated, one dram: let them boil in the waters of Betony and
Fumitory, of each four ounces and half: let them stand for a small while
infused, and to a strong Expression, add syrup of Staechas and Fumitory, with
syrup of Violets, of each half an ounce: mix them for two doses.

5. Having taken one of them in the Morning she voided much pituitous stinking,
feculent and Melancholy Excrements; the next day she took the remainder of the
potion, by which she had six stools.

6. She did always every day anoint her Neck with the above named Oils, wherein
the wool of the neck of a Ram was diped; on the fourth day she was perfectly
freed from this troublesome malady. Petrus Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 111.

LXXX. An Emprosthotonon.

1. An ancient Woman being afflicted with this Disease, which propperly
signifies a Convulsion of the parts inward; desired my Advice, whom finding to
be old, and the Disease so too, and the convulsed members being very hard and
stiff, her Head inclining to her Breast: I would by no means undertake to cure
her; yet I was willing to give her my Advice; and so I ordered her to use the
following Ointment.

2. Take the roots of Marshmallows boiled, three ounces: strain it through a
sive and add thereto the Oil of Lillies and Foxes, of each one ounce: our
Emplaster of Ammoniacum, Goose and Hens grease, the marrow of the leg of an
Heart, of each half an ounce: liquid Storax, two drams: Vnguentum Agrippae,
three drams: the powder of Sage, and Rosemary, of each two scruples: Sulphur
Castoreum, of each one scruple: with a little Wax and Turpentine, make an
Ointment for the part affected, and let the Neck be covered all over with the
skin of a Wolf. Petrus Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 113.

LXXXI. An old Convulsion with a hardness of the Nerve.

1. A certain Maid being taken first with an Epilepsy, and continuing in that
Convulsion, was often for the space of a whole week shaken and convulsed, and
that so vehemently that her Legs all her life long were convulsed and stiff,
neither could she ever walk; she always fat in a Chair; and her condition was
so bad that her Legs almost touched her Knees and Belly.

2. Thus she lived above fifty two years; neither could she scarcely use her
Hands; her Knees also were convulsed, insomuch they were drawn toward the Head.

3. For easing that pain which comes by the Convulsion of the parts, a
dec^ction of the Intestines of Cows and Sheep with their own fat is good, or
anointing the parts with common Oil with which and the Oil of O^ives, the green
flowers of Rosemary, gathered in the driest season, are to be shut up close in
a glass bottle; which being done, set it in the Sun all the canicular days;
then strain it by expression.

4. But if the above named flowers be macerated in the Oils of Lillies, of
Foxes, of Earthworms, and Oil of Melilot, o^ the Oil of Mucilages, they will be
a much better Medicine.

5. Ex scholia ejusdem, for an Ointment: Take the Oil of Lillies, Oil of bitter
Almonds, Oil de Kerva, fex olei lilliorum, the Lees of common Oil; all these
are mild.

6. A stronger sort are the Oils of Pepper, of Costus, Bdellium and Saffron;
but these are less convenient because they resolve much: the fatts to be used
are such, as that of a Hen, Swallow, Porke, Duck, Mutton-sewet, and the fat o^
an Eel.

7. A stronger kind of fat, is the fat of a Cat, Goose, Libbard, Bear, Lion,
Ass, Viper, to which you may add these following Marrows; such according to
Rondeletius is the mildest.

8. Take Oil of sweet Almonds and Lillies, of each four ounces: the fat of a
Hen, Goose, Porke, of each four ounce: the Marrow of a Calves Leg, two ounces:
Mucilage, of Lime-seed, one ounce and half: with a little Wax make an Ointment,
to which add two drams of Castoreum.

9. This following is stronger: Take the Faeces of the Oil of Lillies, the Oil
de Kerva or Sesamen, of each four ounces: the fat of a Goose, Bear and of a
Man, or of a Cat, of each two ounces: Mucilage of line-seed, and Faenu-greek,
of each one ounce and half: Virgins beeswax, three ounces: Bdellium dissolved
in Wine, half an ounce: Castoreum, two drams: Pyrethrum, one dram: with a
sufficient quantity of Wax make an Ointment.

10. The strongest of all is the following: Take the Oil of Foxes, one pound:
the Oil of Lillies and Daffodil, of each four ounces: the fat or blood of a
Swallow, two ounces: the fat of a roasted Eel, two ounces: Bdellium dissolved
in the Vinegar of squills, half an ounce: Liquid Styrax, one ounce: Earthworms
well bruised, four ounces: Castoreum, two drams: red Styrax, three drams: Honey
of Anacardiums, half an ounce: or old Treacle, one ounce: with a sufficient
quantity of Wax, make an Ointment.

11. If the Members be hard and distended because of the cold humors; they are
to be cured with hot remedies, which are such as the Ointments of
Marshmallows, Oesypus, Emplaister of Melilot, if dissolved in the Oil of
Lillies, or in the Oil of Line-seed or in the Oil of Sesa-men. Petrus Forestus,
lib. 10. Observe. 114.

LXXXII. A Convulsion from a distemper in the Womb.

1. A certain Virgin, by reason of the corruption of her seed, fell into
Convulsions of her whole Body; to whom being called; I held to her Nostrills
Assa Faetida, Castoreum, and the like.

2. Afterward applying to her Navel the following Emplaster: Take Emplastrum
contra matricem, spread it upon Leather, about the breadth of a Crown, and that
it may stick the better, spread Galbanum, round the edges thereof.

3. I gave her also the following powder in a spoonful or two of beer, not
Wine, it being hurtful to the Brain, Nerves and Womb, especially when the Womb
is afflicted with any suffocation.

4. Take the seeds of Daucus, and Master-wort, (or in the place of seeds, if
they cannot be had, take the root) the root of Gentian, of each one scruple:
make a subtle powder to be divided into two parts: and to be taken as
abovesaid. Petrus Forestus, lib. 10 Observe. 115.

LXXXIII. A Convulsion from the Womb, and by eating of Mushrooms.

1. A certain Maid living in the Hague, from a suffocation of the Womb, fell
into most horrible convulsive fits, insomuch that the Mandible being convulsed,
her Mouth was shut very close, and her Head was pulled backwards, whilst she
was in the Paroxysm, he Eyes were convulsed as also her Hands and Feet.

2. Another Physician did make for her, oderiferous nodules to be held in the
Womb, as also odorificks for the Nostrils, and did apply Cupping-glasses to the
huckle-bone.

3. These availing little or nothing, we proposed opening of a vein, which
being done, even to admiration, the symptoms were abated.

4. Afterward a decoction was prepared of Cephalic herbs, and such as were
proper for the Womb and Nerves, as the following: Take Sage, Cowslips, Betony,
Mugwort, Fetherfew, Staechas, the leaves of Senna, Agarick, Ani-seeds and a
little Ginger, (boil in water and) make a decoction. When she had taken twice
of the decoction; she was purged enough and grew presently well.

5. Ex scholio ejusdem; This digestive syrup is good because of the Mushrooms?
Take syrup of Fether few, of Betony, of Hysop, of each half an ounce: the water
of Origanum, Hysop, Fennel, of each two ounces: mix them.

6. Take Agarick trochiscated, Oxymel of squills two drams: Electuarium
Eleschoph; Diacarthamum, of each two drams and half: with the Decoction of
Hysop, Origanum, Pennyroyal, of each a sufficient quantity; mix them and make
a Cathar^ick potion; by this she grew well.

7. Afterward I advised her to take for three days one after another fasting,
one dram of Treacle in a glass of generous wine. Perus Forestus, lib. 10.
Observe. 116.

LXXXIV. A Convulsion arising from the pricking of a Nerve.

1. A young Man with a pen-knif accidentally pricked one of the Nerves in the
top of his Finger, an unskilful Chyrurgeon, coming to him, applied a Medicine
which presently closed up the Wound: upon which a pain arose which with a light
Convulsion creeping up his Arm, greatly afflicting him.

2. Another Chyrurgeon was sent for, who immediately applied an Anodyn made of
the Crummes of white Bread with Saffron and the yolks of Eggs raw, by which the
pain was somewhat abated.

3. My advice being also asked, I ordered the Surgeon, to keep the Wound open,
and that he would add to his own Cataplasm Earthworms alive and washed well in
Wine.

4. And for his Convulsion, that he would anoint the whole Arm as well as the
Finger with the Oil of Earthworms, and then apply the Oil of Turpentine to the
Wound, if there was occasion; by these he grew well. Petrus Forestus, lib. 10.
Observe. 119.

LXXXV. A Convulsion from a Wound in the Throat.

1. A Baker in Delf being wounded by a shot in that part of the nape of the
Neck declining to the seventh Spondula; there grew a kernel which grievously
afflicted both Neck and Throat; going from the hinder to the forepart under
the Chin.

2. When at any time he drank or took any liquid supping meat, it went out by
the wound, unless the wound was stopped hard and compressed by a Cloth; the
Nerve about the seventh Vertebra being broken, it leading to the Hand, his
whole left Hand was taken with a Palsy.

3. About the seventh day after this disaster he was taken with a Convulsion of
his Shoulders, the left Arm and Fingers, there was also a Contraction of the
left Ey.

4. My Advice being desired; I ordered because he was costive, the following
suppository: Take pil. Hierae picrae, two scruples: the powder of Alhandal
trochiscated, half a scruple: with a sufficient quantity of Honey and a little
Salt, make a Suppository.

5. Having taken this he went to stool, but his Excrements were hard and black,
as if they contained coagulated Blood.

6. The Blood coming from the wound and falling down on the Stomach, some
portion thereof descended to the Intestines; if much had fallen, it would have
caused putrefaction and then a Fever.

7. Although he had no Fever, yet his Urine was not without some Tincture; he
had a Thirst; therefore for cleansing of the wound and cure of his thirst, I
ordered him the following Syrups.

8. Take Syrup of Lemons, two ounces: Syrup of the Infusion of Roses, one ounce
and half: mix them, and let them be taken often.

9. And because his Excrement was hard after the suppository, I gave him the
same day one ounce of fresh Cassia in posset drink; which having taken gave him
two stools.

10. For his Throat and light Cough, I gave him the following Lohoch; which he
was always to lick: Take syrup of Violets, syrup of the infusion of Roses, of
each one ounce: Sugar peneds, half an ounce: make a Lambitive, which use with a
liquirish-stick.

11. At Night because he lay always upon his Reins, we caused his Loins near
the Reins to be anointed with the Oil of Roses; and because of the Convulsion
and resolution the Chyrurgeon by our Direction anointed the Backbone and nape
with the Oil of Earthworms; to which was added the Oil of Hypericon.

12. His Belly being yet hard we prescribed the retaking of the above named
Suppository.

13. Twice a day his wound was dressed, and in the hinder part of the Nape a
Tent was put, but not in the forepart, although the wound reached thither.

14. In the mean time we prescribed the following Decoction: Take Coltsfoot,
Barley husked, of each one handful: Centaury the lesser, Sanicle, Hypericon,
Maidenhair, of each one pugil: Raisons stoned, one ounce: Liquorish cut in
pieces, half an ounce: Jujubes, Sebestens, of each number, five: Polypody of
the Oak, half an ounce: Boil them in Water, and to one pound of the straining
add Syrup of the Infusion of red Roses, three ounces: mix them for an Apozem.

15. But being again bound, I prescribed the following Potion: Take the Leaves
of Sena cleansed from their Stalks, three drams: Aniseeds, half a dram: choice
Rhubarh, one dram: Schae nanthus, half a scruple: Boil them, which done, infuse
all night in five ounces of the above mentioned Apozem; he took four ounces of
the Expression with one ounce of the Syrup of the Infusion of Roses; by which
Potion he had one stool.

16. Therefore the day after he took the half of the following Potion: Take the
Leav^s of Sena, six drams: Rhuharb, one dram and half: Aniseeds, one dram:
Schaenanthus, half a scruple: Boil them gently, and then infuse them into nine
ounces of the Decoction all night; in the Morning give the half, it being
strongly expressed, with the Syrup of Betony, and Violets, of each half an
ounce: mix them, by this he had three stools; neither was he then feverish.

17. Not long after most grievous Convulsions hapened in his left Arms and
Fingers, insomuch that he could neither eat nor sleep, his Condition then was
so bad that we looked upon him as one ready to expire.

18. Therefore we ordered this Sear-cloath to be applied to his Neck, and the
Neck with the Backbone to be anointed with the following Oils, the Arm,
Fingers, Armpits are likewise to be anointed with the same Oil and fomented
with unwashed Wool.

19. Take the Oil of Earthworms, one ounce: Oil of sweet Almonds, and D^^l, of
each half an ounce: common Oil, Oil of Lillies, of each three drams: the Fat of
a Goose, one ounce: mix them for a Liniment.

20. The Searcloath which is to be applied to the Nape of the Neck is such as
follows: Take the Oil of Earth Worms, one ounce: Oil of sweet Almonds, and Oil
of Dill, of each half an ounce: common Oil, three drams: the Fat of a Hen,
Goose, and Calf, of each half an ounce: the Fat of a Duck, two drams: the
Powder of Earthworms dried, half an ounce: the Powder of the Flowers of
Hypericon dried, two drams: with a sufficient quantity of Wax, make a
Searcloath according to Art, adding a little Turpentine for the better
Consistency of the whole: let it be put on a linen Cloth and apply it to the
Nape.

21. Then for cleansing and consolidation the following Potion was prescribed:
Take Barley, one pugil: Agrimony; Sanicle the lesser, white Daisy, of each one
handful: Centaury the lesser, red Coleworts, of each half an handful: the roots
of Comfrey the greater, one ounce: Liquorish scraped, six drams: Boil them in
Water till the Barley burst, to one pound of the strained Liquor add the Syrup
of the Infusion of R^s^s, three ounces: make an Apozem for four Doses.

22. He took often of these Syrups: Take the Syrup of Pomegranats, the Syrup of
the Infusion of Roses, of each one ounce and half: mix them.

23. Having in vain used the above mentioned Suppository; I gave him for his
Costiveness four ounces of the Infusion above named, adding thereto one ounce
of the Syrup of Violets; by this he went to stool five times.

24. We ordered him because he was weak, a small parcel of the Lozenges of
Sugar pearled; afterward he began to grow better, and his wound came by little
and little to a Consolidation.

25. There was also prescribed again half an ounce of the Unguent of Roses for
the Loins to be anointed with, and for his Arm and Throat only the Oil of sweet
Almonds.

26. Presently after his paralitick Arm was fomented with Lavender-Water, three
ounces: Aqua Vitae, one ounce: mix them.

27. The Convulsions with pains returning again, this following Cataplasm was
applied to the whole Arm: Take the Flowers of Cammomil, Melilot, of each four
handfuls: the Leaves of Wormwood, two handfuls; the Tops of Dill, one handful:
Boil them to a softness in thick Beer, then add Earthworms, two pugils: Oil of
Foxes and Roses, of each one pugil: this did not only mitigate the pains, but
did assuage the Convulsions and Inflations.

28. Moreover this Apozem was used: Take Sage, Betony, Hypericon, Vervin,
Fumitary, Borage, Bugloss, of each one handful: the Cordial Flowers, one pugil:
Aniseeds, two drams: Barley cleansed, one pugil: the Leaves of Sena, seven
drams: Polypody of the Oak, half an ounce: Raisons stoned, one ounce: Liquorish
scraped, half an ounce: Damask Prunes, number nine: Boil them in Water, to nine
ounces of the strongest Colature add Syrup of the Infusion of Roses, two
ounces: Syrup of Betony, one ounce: mix them, make an Apozem for three Dos^es,
to be taken in the Morning.

29. Every day twice or thrice he went to stool, his wound began now to be
consolidated, first in the forepart, then in the hinder, which to me seemed
very strange.

30. He yet feeling Convulsions and Pains through out the whole Arm, we ordered
that his Arm, up to his Armpits should be anointed with the following
Liniment: Take Oils of Dill, Cammomil, Lillies, Earthworms, Foxes, of each
half an ounce: the Oil of Melilot, three drams: mix them; this did egregiously
abate the pain, and then the Cataplasm was no more used.

31. When a few days were passed we ordered that the whole Arm should be bathed
in a Bath made of the D^coction of Beer with Herbs, which might strengthen the
Nerves, mitigate the pain, and ease the contracted Members, as the roots of
white Lillies; Marshmallows, Flowers of Cammomil, Melilot, garden and wild
Sage, Wormwood, Hypericon, Mugwort, Earthworms, being added.

32. Omitting for a while these kinds of Baths we commanded that he should be
anointed with the following Liniment: Take Oil of Foxes, one ounce and half:
Oil of Hypericon, Oil of Earthworms, of each half an ounce: Oil of Spike, two
drams: Vnguentum Martiatum, the Fat of a Badger, of a Goose, of a Cat, of each
three drams: Deers Marrow, three drams: mix them and make a Liniment.

33. He could now move his Fingers, and although he felt sometimes a kind of
Stupefaction in his left paralitick Leg; yet he could go uprightly, not without
some trouble, therefore we ordered him to be anointed with the following Oils;
Take Oil of Foxes, two ounces: Oil of Turpentine, one ounce: Oil of Costus,
half an ounce: mix them, by this Ointment he was helped; insomuch that he could
walk without any Difficulty.

34. He did complain of the pain of his arm, and the contraction of his
Fingers, I advised him to anoint the parts affected with Dogs Fat only; and
after anointing the pain by Degrees vanished away; but the Arm was wrapped up
in a wild Cats skin, and the Contractions by little and little ceased. Petrus
Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 122.

LXXXVI. A Convulsion from a fall.

1. A Carpenter falling from a great hight, broke his left Leg and Elbow; he
also received some hurt in his Head, and about his Eye, his Leg was broken
without any wound, but his Cubit with a wound.

2. The following potion was given him: Take the Decoction of the leaves of
Sena, and Rhubarb; decoctum Commune, of each a sufficient quantity, which
sweeten with the syrup of the juice of Roses, adding one scruple, of Mummy and
Nutmeg, half a scuple: this did gently purge him, by which he seemed to be
better.

3. After two or three days Intermission he took the same potion again, which
had so good an Effect that he did evacuate coagulated Blood, and much pituitous
matter.

4. On the sixth day by a fall in the Night he fell into Convulsions, his
Daughter at first sight, thought that her Father laughed, which we concluded to
be a Sardonick laughter, presaging lamentably bad Convulsions.

5. Immediately in the fit his Mouth was closed together, and his whole Body
was convulsed; we predicted death to him unless the Convulsion did cease within
the fourth day.

6. Many proper Medicines were applied; which did not contribute much to his
relief; on the seventh day his Urine was stopped by the Convulsion, but his
Privy parts being anointed with the Oil of Scorpions; he immediately rendered
his Urine; neither could he swallow any sustenance.

7. His Distemper growing worse and worse, he dyed on the seventh Night of his
Disease, in one of his convulsive fits. Petrus Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 123.

LXXXVII. A Cynick Convulsion or the torture of the Mouth.

1. A Man about sixty six years of age, was taken with a cananine Convulsion or
the torture of the Mouth: coming to him, I ordered a Clyster, which he not
taking I prescribed the following syrup.

2. Take Oxymel simple, syrup of Staechas, Honey of Roses strained, of each
half an ounce: water of Betony, Sage, and Hysop, of each one ounce: mix them.

3. Then I gave him the following Pill: Take Pil. hiera simplex, Agarick
trochiscated, of each half a dram: with syrup of Staechas, make five Pills;
which he took a good while after he supped, they gave him two stools.

4. Returning the next day to visit him, and finding his Urin red thick and
muddy, I ordered Cupping-glasses to be applied to his Shoulders, and a good
quantity of Blood to be taken from him.

5. Then the syrup being again exhibited to him, I purged him with Pills proper
against Convulsions. Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 124.

6. If there should happen a fullness without a Crudity; a Clyster being first
Injected, you may take from him some Blood, and diminish the matter by Pills;
and digest the Phlegm by digestive syrups.

7. Others would not have strong Medicines applied in the beginning of the
Disease nor sharp Clysters, nor strong purgatives and digestives; but must
defer to the fourth day, or as some would have, to the seventh day: unless
there be just fears of an approaching Epilepsy or Apoplexy.

8. The matter is to be digested with this or the like Magisterial syrup: Take
the roots of true Acorus, half an ounce: Betony, Marjoram, Origanum, Cowslips,
Hysop, Rosemary, of each one handful: the flowers of both Stachas's, one pugil:
boil them in Sage and Betony waters, in a double Vessel; add to the straining
syrup of Staechas, three ounces: Aromatise it with Nutmeg; and make an Apozeme,
Or, a sufficient quantity of Honey being added; boil them to the consistency of
a Magisterial syrup.

9. Or make use of this or the like Melicrat: Take the roots of the true
Acorus, half an ounce: Staechas, one handful: boil them in a quart of water and
to the strained liquor, add half a pound more or less of Honey; make clarifyed
Mead, which aromatize with one dram of Nutmeg.

10. Let him be purged by little and little, first with Pill Cochiae and
Hierae, then with Pil. Fetidae and Cochiae but if he cannot swallow Pills, he
may take this following potion.

11. Take Diacatholicon, half an ounce: Electuary of Dates, or Diaphaenicon,
one dram and half: Electuary Elescoph, one dram: Electuary Indij Majoris, two
scruples and half: with three ounces of the abovementioned decoction or Mead,
honey of Roses strained, half an ounce; mix them and make a potion.

12. If a stronger is needful, let him be purged with Hiera Pachij and Hiera
Scribonij.

13. But if the Malady be not yet mitigated, the Veins under the Tongue are to
be opened, then frictions of all the members, as Hands and Feet etc. are to be
used. Ex scholio ejusdem.

LXXXVIII. A Convulsion in a Youth.

1. A Youth was so miserably convulsed that he could not any ways bend his
Back; by the following remedy he could presently walk.

2. Take rank old Butter, old Lard, of each three ounces: Bdellium, Ammoniacum,
of each one ounce: Myrrh, Castoreum, of each three drams: flowers of Staechas,
and Rosemary, of each one pugil: Nutmegs, Cloves, of each one dram: a little
Cat emboweled, skinned, and cut in pieces; with this infarse the Belly of a
Goose, sow it up and then roast it.

3. The first juice that comes from it, is to be cast away, the second is to
preserved in a vessel han^full of Vinegar; therewith anoint the Back; this is a
Divine Medicine. Petrus Pachequus, Observe. 8.

LXXXIX. A Convulsion in a certain Noble Person.

1. A certain noble person being afflicted with most severe pains proceeding
from violent Convulsions; Guillandinus commanded him to be dipped into a Barrel
of Oil; by which he was much refreshed.

2. Coral by its own natural property (says Heurnius) is good for a Convulsion
that proceeds from Emptiness; and the same Author says, That Convulsions that
come from repletion are much helped by the application of hot and dry
Medicines; as the decoction of Peony, lignum Guajacum, Sarsa-parilla,
Sassafras, Treacle, Mithridate, Castoreum etc.

3. He further alleges, That in Convulsions that proceed from a Plethory,
blood leting, and then a Bath of hot Oil are convenient.

XC. The Convulsion Opisthotonus in a Child.

1. Hieronymus Cardanus said, That he cured a Child of seventeen months old of
the Opisthotonus Convulsion, by three sorts of helps, to wit; abstinence from
flesh, Wine and Eggs, cloths diped in the Oil of Cammomil and Lillies, applied
to the Neck, and other parts convulsed.

2. And a confected Medicament made of Mithridate, with triple Sugar of Roses,
pearls Jacincts and Emeralds.

XCI. Convulsions in an Infant Prince.

1. There is no remedy more profitable than the Embrocation of the hinder part
of the Head, the nape and Neck with the Oil of Violets indifferent warm; I used
this to Lodowick Prince of Pidemont, who in the time of his Infancy was
afflicted with a Disease, called St. Antonie's-fire in his Thigh, and an
Apostume near the huckle-bone and Joints of his hip; with a Fever.

2. Of which being indifferently well recovered he fell into a Convulsion
caused by dryness; crying out perpetually; and by virtue of the same Disease
his Head was contracted toward the hinder parts; so that he could not suck the
Breast.

3. I anointed the nape and whole hinder part of his Head and Neck with Oil of
Violets made pretty warm, causing the Oil to fall from a good height, and with
my Hand expressing a Rag which was dipped therein, and that for the space of a
quarter of an hour, and so by embrocating he began to sleep.

4. Immediately I wiped his Head with warm cloths by a gentle frication; being
awake, after three or four hours sleep, he sucked Milk without any difficulty.

5. The same symptoms returning once or twice; the same remedy being
reiterated, he was made perfectly well: Petrus Bayrus, Pract. lib. 2. cap. 20.

XCII. A Convulsion in the Abdomen and Intestines.

1. When I was student at Pudua, I saw a young Man whose Intestines and whole
Abdomen were convulsed; his testes and spermatick vessels under the Mouth of
the privy parts were hidden, there was also an extension of the Hypochondria.

2. He was of constitution cold; having a cold Stomach and sweaty; the
Diaphragma being oppressed he fetched his wind thick and short; and was
demented whilst he was in the Paroxysm.

3. The masters of the university did exhibit to him such Medicines as did
discuss the flatuous humors, and by digesting and purging would overcome the
cold matter and strengthen the intestines.

4. First a Clyster was injected of the decoction of Dill, with Hiera, Honey of
Roses, and Oil of Cammomil; then by a decoction of Agrimony and Parsley he was
prepared.

5. Afterward he was purged with pil. Aureae and Alephanginae; every other day
a Clyster was repeated.

6. He was anointed with the Oil of Rue, and Castoreum, sometimes he took one
Pill of Castoreum with the syrup of Betony.

7. He also did drink wine wherein was Sage and Betony; his Legs were likewise
rubbed. Jo. Heurnius, cap. 26. de morb.

8. There was an old woman who had pains of the Arms, Shoulders and Knees with
a Convulsion, having used many remedies in vain, at length by applying burnt
Malago to her side; there being added the leaves of Bays, Nep, Staechas,
Marjoram, Rosemary, Origanum and Sage, as also a fumigation and sweat; being
taken she grew very well. Solenander, Cons. 15. sect. 5.

XCIII. A flatulent Convulsion.

1. This following Liniment is Excellent good for that Disease: Take the fat of
a little Bitch, to which add the flowers of Germander and Lavender, of each two
handfuls: Ground pine, Rosemary; Hysop, of each one pugil: Earthworms washed
in wine, number seven; Castoreum, two drams: Turpentine and Honey of each one
ounce: these being cut and bruised, take a fat Goose, which deplumate and
eviscerate, then wash it in Wine and roast it, putting under the spit a vessel
wherein is generous wine mixed with a little water, and reserving for use the
fat that drops therein from the said Goose.

2. This has been found-by experience to have don much good in Convulsions of
this nature: Take Foxes fat, and if that cannot be had, take the fat of a Dog;
mix therewith some grains of Pepper grossly bruised, with a small quantity of
generous Wine, or Aqua vitae; boil them over a gentle fire to the consumption
of the Wine, strain the fat through a linen cloth and reserve it for use: rubb
therewith the convulsed members. Reinerus Solenander, Cons: 23. sect. 2.

XCIV. A Dog-like Convulsion or Cramp.

1. A Woman aged four and thirty, fell into a Disease which by some is called a
Canine or Dog-like Convulsion, which is a Resolution of the mandibular Muscles;
the Mouth, Lips, Nose, Eyes, and Face of this miserable Woman was very often in
an hour distorted and distended sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left
Side.

2. In the Fit she knew the Bystanders, but speak she could not; being called
to see her, I gave her thrice every quarter of an hour thirteen drops of our
Oleum Heraclium; by this and Gods Blessing she began immediately to speak and
was happily freed from this Disease. Martianus Rulandus, Cent. 4. Observe. 96.

XCV. A kind of Convulsion or Cramp in which the Head was twisted to the left
Side.

1. A famous Merchant came to me complaining of an old Disease, and I perceived
it by his wry Neck. It came as he said, thus;

2. A year before, in the Winter approaching, he returned home out of Italy
through the Alps, and often suffered cold; and going over a Lake, he slept in
the Boat, and when waked, was all over cold, and first he felt a pain in the
Nape of the Neck.

3. This continued till his Head began to hang on the left side against his
will, or a Contraction which still he had to the admiration of Beholders.

4. He had used many general and particular Medicines, and the Sulphur-Baths;
and by them he found some Good, his Neck was not so stiff bent down as before.

5. He desired to know of me the cause, I proved it by many Arguments to be a
kind of Cramp distinct from a Convulsion; such as when the Head is against the
will drawn down; and when by voluntary Motion it is drawn up, it presently
falls down again.

6. I said, That the part affected was the Muscles that moved the Head on that
side, that came from the Neck and Back, and are fixed to the Head; and this
comes from the distemper of them; and so as in the Cramp the sick part draws
down the sound.

7. Hence it is that he found pain, not only in the Neck, but above in the Back
from whence those long Muscles came that reach to the Head, and go this ways:
Especially those Muscles suffer in that part where they end in tendons, and
broad Aponeuroses or Nerves, met in the upper part of the Nape of the Neck, and
are fastened to the Head.

8. Those Tendons bound up and so made shorter, always draw the Head on one
side, except by the contrary forcible motion of the head, they are drawn up for
a little time; For when this voluntary forced motion ceased the Head is drawn
aside again.

9. The Disease that makes those membranous, or nervous insertions or
entrances to be bound, is a cold Distemper, which is an Enemy to the Nerves and
Membrans, and also to the bloody parts, hurting them and making them shorter,
by binding them, so that they will scarce be brought to their former shape.

10. This cold Distemper came from cold Air, which sooner gets into those parts
naked.

11. Moreover he being prone to sweat, his Body was suddenly cooled; and
therefore the hurt was worse in that part, because he used to go bare headed
when he sweat and wiped himself.

12. After this Discourse he desired my Advice, though I doubted of the Cure:
being it was an old and stubborn Infirmity, and the Tendons were dry and hard,
yet I would try an Emollient proper Ointment for the Nerves, which I prescribed
him.

13. About the end of December he wrote that for twelve days he anointed the
Nape of the Neck and all the Backbone, which I commanded not, but only the
Neck behind, an^ that there was a soft Tumor risen against his left
shoulder blade, and like two knots in the hinder part of the Neck that pained
him, and his Cramp continued.

14. A month, after about the end of January, he wrote to me to take in hand
the cure at the Spring; that there were Bladders, where he anointed, and water
flowed from them when they were broken.

15. This I showed him came not from the Head, for the Defluctions from his
Head went another way; but the emollient Ointment opening the Pores, caused the
water under the Skin to transpire.

16. I prescribed the Emollients to be repeated in form of Fomentations,
Emplasters, Cataplasms, and gave Pills to keep the Body clean, and such as were
proper for the Nerves.

17. I advised to go to the Sulphur-Bath at Spring; by which he formerly found
good; he used these Remedies till May, and had an Issue in each Arm, yet the
Disease was as before.

18. He went to the Spaw and there stayed using it three weeks, and sweat much,
and he commanded that Water to be constantly poured upon his Neck; coming from
the Baths to me, he showed that his Head was not as before, drawn on the left
side, but could stand upright, and could look upon men; and nobody took notice
of his wry Neck.

19. But another Accident happened, he could not turn his Head to the left
side, and that in his left shoulder, and near his back he was so violently
drawn down, that he could not bear up without a Staff or stand upright or lie
down; nor could he walk or ride without a Staff upon his Stirup, and that he
felt pain as in a windy Cramp.

20. His ordinary Physician and I, concluded because the Disease was so
stubborn, though there was small hope of Recovery, to do something to encourage
him.

21. We gave him order for the following Pills, by which he found Benefit, and
an Ointment for his back, and a moist Bath of the Decoction of proper Herbs, he
used these all the Dog Days; and the Issue in his left Arm was stopped, and
another made in the right.

22. About the middle of August, his Physician wrote to me that by the use of
those Medicines he was nothing mended, but that his backbone did bend sometimes
to his left side. That he fell to the ground as if he were pressed down with a
weight, when he had not the help of a Staff: that he doubted, whether this came
from the retractions of the Tendons of the Muscles on one side, or relaxing of
the other, because they were forcibly drawn to the left side.

23. Moreover he said, that he wondered that since the Patient could not go
without a Staff, and when a great weight was laid on his left shoulder, he
could without a Staff walk straight.

24. To this I answered, that this came from the Muscles of the Back that fill
the backbone from the Neck to the Loins on both sides, the lowest part of
which grew all along the backbone, and move it; of which there are eight pair,
four that bend to the Neck, and four to the Back, and raise them again with an
opposite Motion.

25. That the cause of the Disease was in these, and chiefly at the first in
them that move the Neck and Head, as I showed him; when his Head only was drawn
on the left side; but now those Muscles that move the Back are infected, and so
the bone is drawn aside.

26. And this is not on both sides: for then the bone would be stiff, but only
on the left side, by which the bone is drawn violently, and the part affected
draws to it the sound part, as I showed in Convulsions.

27. And it is a sign that the Muscles of the right side are not relaxed (for
then the sound part should draw the weak) because the inclination to the left
side is not as in a Palsy, from the weight of the part, by which it gently
declineth, but from a force that violently draws it, with pain as in a Cramp,
and so that the opposite Muscles are compelled to follow; in a Palsy there is
no attraction, but the part becomes loose and flaggy without pain, and is
rather stupid and benumbed.

28. From whence it appears that in this Convulsion the Muscles of the back all
along the left side are affected.

29. And that this is true, this may demonstrate; because as in a windy Cramp,
if the Muscles contracted are drawn back by the force of the opposite Muscles,
or by help of the hand, the contraction of the pain ceases; so in this, when on
the left side the Muscles of the back there contracted, are driven back by
leaning hard upon a Staff, or by a weight upon the opposite shoulder, the back
is right again; so that he may walk as long as it is so. Platerus, Lib. 1. Page
141.

XCVI. A Cramp and a wry Mouth.

1. A Countryman as often as he went to speak had his whole Cheek on the right
side in a Cramp, trembling and twiching upward and downward, so that he was
forced to hold it down with his hands to stay the violent Motion.

2. After he had been thus a year, and used Empericks in vain; he came to me;
first I purged him, and applied dry Cupping-Glasses, without Scarification
under his Ears to his shoulders and back, then I gave him Mithridate, but that
not making him sleep, I gave Syrup of Poppies thrice, increasing the quantity
till he took two ounces and a half.

3. And when he slept not at all; I gave him my Narcotick that night, then he
slept and sweat soundly, and that repeaped, made his Sleep natural and the
twitching of his Check ceased. Platerus, Lib. 1. Page. 130.

XCVII. A Tetanos in a Maiden.

1. A Maid about sixteen years of age, was taken with a Tetanos; by which she
had her Neck drawn awry; within two days she was cured by the following
Epythema.

2. Take Oil of Cammomil, Oil of Roses, of each four ounces: fresh Butter, five
ounces: mix them for an Epythem; in which a cloth three times double and apply
it to the Neck warm; repeating it every three hours; by this she was cured.
Martinus Rulandus, Cent. 4. Observe. 84.

XCVIII. A Convulsion with involuntary Laughter.

1. A certain noble Person, of nature melancholic, was often taken with a
durable involuntary Laughter, with a trembling and convulsive motion of the
extreme parts, from a collection of a sharp choleric humor about the Viscera
of the second concoction fermenting, and after a peculiar manner corrupted,
from whence vapors proceeding and touching the Diaphragma and vellicating it,
provoked and caused involuntary Laughter; and reaching the musculous and
nervous parts did stimulate nature and excite Convulsions by their inimical and
sharp quality.

2. The Body being first evacuated by Melanagogues and Phlegmagogues; four or
five spoonfuls were given of Hydromel laxative tartarisated; at length for
discussing the corrupt matter, which did infest the nervous System, one dram of
the following Powder was taken in black Cherrie water and Pauls-Betony;
sweating thereafter in bed for some Mornings.

3. Take the Roots of Angelica, Swallowwort, of each one dram: Sarsaparilla,
Cloves, Paeony, Divels-bit, of each two drams: Rosemary-Flowers, Sage, Time, of
each half a dram: Bay Berries, one dram: Species diambrae compositae, Diamoschi
Amari, of each half a dram: Confectio Diaxyloaloes, half an ounce: the cure
succeeded according to desire. Thonerus, Lib. 2. Observe. 4.

XCIX. A Convulsion of Diverse parts caused from Worms.

1. A Maid of fourteen years of age finding a constriction in her Neck,
employed a Chyrurgion, who concluding that her distemper proceeded from a
Catarrh; thought to give her ease by a gargarism; which attempt proved
unsuccessful.

2. This Virgin growing worse and worse and being in great peril of
suffocation, I was called upon about midnight to visit her; whom I found
sitting up in her Bed, complaining of the contraction of her Jaws, and crying
out that she was at the very point of Expiration for want of Breath.

3. Her Convulsions were very conspicuous in both Arms and both Legs; sometimes
in the right, sometimes in the left Arm even to her Breast; sometimes in the
right, sometimes in the left Leg even to her Hipps.

4. First of all I conceived that the following Cordial water would be very
proper for a person under such deplorable circumstances: Take the water of
Borage and black Cherries, of each two ounces: Lilly Convally, Balm, Betony, of
each one ounce: Cinnamon, half an ounce: red Coral prepared, one scruple:
Bezoar, Origanum, fix grains, Lozenges of Sugar pearled, six drams, mix them:
she had scarcely taken above one or two spoonfuls of this Dose but the
constriction of her Neck was so much abated, that she could breath freely.

5. From thence I began to suspect that those symptoms had their rise from
Worms; which being appeased by the sweetness of the Cordial water; did cease
from troubling of her.

6. Afterward I exhibited the following laxative potion: Take the leaves of
Sena, three drams: Agarick trochiscated, Rhubarb, of each two scruples:
Cinnamon, Ginger of each half a scruple: infuse in the water of Botony spirit
of Vitriol, three drops: the Colature gently expressed, three ounces: dissolve
choice Manna, one ounce.

7. About four hours after taking, she voided two very long worms; with much
vicious humors; the symptoms growing more remiss and less troublesome.

8. I also gave her the following things for carrying off the remainder of the
humors Take the roots of Ditany, of Zedoary, Tormentil, of each one dram: the
seeds of Wormwood, two pugils: the leaves of Worm wood, Carduus Benedictus,
Centaury the lesser, of each half an handful: the leaves of Sena, six drams:
fresh Agarick trochiscated, of each four scruples: Cinnamon, two scruples:
Ginger, Galengal, of each one scruple: make a Bag for wine, two pounds: water
of Carduus Benedictus, one pound four ounces.

9. Of this she took before Dinner, and in the Evening one great worm was
voided, and she was delivered from that malady. Thonerus, lib. 2. Observe. 1.

C. A Convulsion which afflicted day and night at intervals.

1. A Man about seventy years of age, was afflicted above half a year with
Convulsions; the Paroxysm coming often both Day and Night.

2. Many malignant vapors arising from the Abdomen, did cause a vellication
and Convulsion of the nervous parts; with other bad symptoms; and there was a
suppression of Urine.

3. Among other things, I ordered him to take the distilled Oil of Amber
rectifyed, six drops, with Parsly-water; two or three spoonfulls; this being
sometimes given warm, did not only provoke urine, but also abated the other
afflicting symptom. Thonerius, lib. 2. Observe. 2.

CI. An excellent remedy against the Cramp.

1. Several who had been affected with the Disease, did upon the bare skin and
places grived wear the root of common flagg.

2. Also the skin of about twenty silver Eels new flaied, and chopped small,
were boiled in two pound of May-butter, and four handfuls of Rue; after boiling
scumm it well, anointing the grived part therewith, and this will work the same
effect. Anonymus.

CII. A remedy against the contraction or shrinking of the Sinews.

1. A Man about six and twenty years old, having a sore and ulcerated Leg,
fell into the hands of unexpert Chyrurgions, who by their corrosives shrunk up
the Sinews; insomuch that he could neither go nor stand.

2. By the following Medicines he was perfectly cured: he was once purged with
Aromatico, and then for two or three days he took quintessence solutive with
syrup of Roses, and drank thereupon a little Broth.

3. Then the following Bath was used, as also the Ointment against contraction
of Sinews, described by Leon ard Phioravant.

4. Take two or three young whelps that can not see, boil them in water with
Mallows, Hollihock, Mellilot, Walwort, Cammomil, of each one handful: boil the
Whelps till the flesh fall from the bones, which being done strain it, then
has therewith very warm. Anonymus.

CIII. Another remedy for the same Disease.

A Child having her Neck drawn awry with a kind of Cramp; was Cured by drnking
every Morning and Evening a little Aqua Balsami Phioravante; then was her Neck
also anointed with some of the said water mixed with Magno Liquore Phiorvante,
and in the space of ten days she was perfectly cured. Anonymus.

2. Another of the same: Take the Oil of Bricks one ounce: Oil of Turpentine,
half an ounce: of Juniper Berries, two drams: of Cloves, one dram: of Nutmegs
and Mace, of each half a dram: mix them with a sufficient quantity, of the Oil
of Wax make it in the form of a Liniment: and therewith anoint the grived
parts. Anonymus.

CIV. The Tortore or Convulsion of the Mouth.

1. A man about fifty years of age very obnoxious to Catarrhs, was taken with
the tortore of the Mouth or Dog-like Convulsion; I coming to visit him in the
Evening, I prescribed for preparing the pituitous humors, these following
things.

2. Take Waters of Betony, and the Flowers of the Tile-Tree, of each one ounce
and half: Syrup of Peony, one ounce: Spirit of Vitriol, six drops: make a Julep
for one Dose to be taken at nine of the clock at night.

3. The second day in the Morning he took these purgative Pills: Take Extractum
Catholicum, Cochiae, of each half a scruple: the Oil of Sage, two drops: make
fifteen Pills.

4. The third day a Vein was opened in his right Arm; the fourth day in the
Morning Cupping-Glasses with Scarification were applied to the Shoulders, and
in the Evening a Vesicatory was applied to the Neck.

5. Troches of Mastick were prescribed: Take the Roots of Pyrethrum, one dram:
choice Mastick, Cubebs, long Pepper, of each half a dram: Treacle, Mithitrade,
of each one scruple: Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth, and Sugar, of each a
sufficient quantity: make Troches of Mastick.

6. The fifth day I ordered two Baggs to be made hot upon a hot Tile which was
before sprinkled and wetted with white Wine; and one of them to be applied to
the hinder part of the Head, and the other to the Jaw Bone.

7. Take the Leaves of Betony, Sage, Cowslips, Gout-Ivy, of each one handful:
the Flowers of Primrose, Elder, Staechas, Rosemary, of each one pugil: Juniper
and Bay Berries, of each two drams: cut them into pieces for two Baggs.

8. When on the sixth day the Symptoms were not remitted, I prescribed the
following Pills to be exhibited in the Morning: Take extractum Pil. Aureae. one
scruple: Resin of Jallap, five grains: Oil of Amber, two drops: make eleven
Pills gilded, let them be taken presently.

9. Seventhly Cupping-Glasses were again repeated, and for revulsion of the
phlegmatic Humors from the Brain and Parts affected, a Gargasins and sneezing
Powder were prescribed.

10. Take the Roots of Pyrethrum, two drams: the Leaves of Betony, Sage,
Marjoram, Rosemary, and Ground Pine, of each half an handful: Mustard seed, one
dram and half: Juniper Berries, one dram: boil them in a sufficient quantity of
fountain water; strain, and in eight ounces of the straining dissolve Oxymel,
of Squills, one ounce: make a Gargarism which is to be taken warm.

11. Take the Flowers of Lilly-Convally, Marjoram, Rosemary, Betony, of each
half a scruple: Roots of Pyrethrum, six grains: Musk, Amber, of each one grain:
make a sneesing-Pouder.

12. On the eighth day, I prescribed the following Electuary; and Tragaea for
strengthening the Brain: Take the Conserves of the Flowers of Betony, one
ounce: Peony, half an ounce: Marjoram, two drams: Citron-Peels, half an ounce:
Indian Nutmegs preserved, two drams: Species Diambrae, one scruple: Diamoschi,
half a scruple: Syrup of Peony, a sufficient quantity: make an Electuary; of
which take at pleasure the quantity of a Nutmeg.

13. Take Species Diamoschi, two drams: Marchion, half a dram: Diambrae, one
scruple: Oil of Cinnamon and Mace, of each two drops: Sugar of Roses tabled,
three ounces: make a Tragaea.

14. On the ninth day the Tortore of the Mouth being somewhat abated, I ordered
that the Cheek-bone which was affected should be twice a day anointed with the
following water somewhat warm: Take Aqua Vitae with Castoreum and Mastick, of
each one ounce and half: Sage, two ounces: the distilled Oil of Rosemary, one
scruple: mix them.

15. By the help or these Medicines the sick recovered his Health; neither did
there appear any more a Tortore of the Mouth.

16. To prevent a Relapse, I commanded both Spring and Fall the following
purging Bagg to be taken, and about the Vintage to prepare a medicated Wine of
new Wine.

17. Take Roots of Peony, three drems: leaves of Betony, Marjoram, Carduus
Benedictus, of each half an handful.: the Tops of Centaury the lesser, the
Flowers of Lilly Convally, of each one pugil: the leaves of choice Sena, two
ounces: choice Rhubarb, two drams: Aniseeds, one dram and half: being cut, put
them into a Bagg of white Silk, to which pour two quarts of white Wine; six
ounces of the strained Liquor may be taken in the Morning every other day,
observing a good Diet.

Measures of new Wine; of which g^ve the Patient a Cup full for a draught in ^he
Morning and at Dinner. Bernardus Verzaschae, Obser. 42.

CV. Convulsions in a Child.

1. A Child was afflicted for the space of six years with grievous Convulsions,
not only his Head but his Arm and Thigh were so much convulsed that he could
not bow them, in the Paroxysm he remembered all those that were then present,
but after the Fit was over he slept for a long time.

2. Some were of opinion it pas an Epilepsy, others a seveer Cholick, a third
Convulsions arising from Worms.

3. He used the Water of the Flowers of Lilly Convally and the Tile-Tree
distilled with Wine; Wormwood also was boiled in Wine, and applied to the
Navel, etc. yet all this did the Patient no good; for no sooner had he drunk
thereof but he was taken with a Fit.

4. I advised him to put to his drink a little Hartshorn burnt, then to take a
spoonful of the following Syrup.

5. Take the Syrup of the Flowers of Peony, one ounce: Syrup of Mint, five
ounces: the Water of the Flowers of Peony, of Clove-Gilli-flowers, and of the
Flowers of Cammomil, of each one ounce: mix them.

6. Afterward apply to the Navel unwashed Wool moistened with the Oil of Dill,
of Cammomil, and Verbascum; when he had used these things he grew well by
little and little. Gabelchoverus, Cent. 4. Cur. 57.

CVI. Epileptick Convulsions.

1. A certain Gentleman fell into sudden Convulsions of the whole Body with
Epileptick Paroxysms, and vomiting of Blood; this Person after he had taken one
or two spoonfuls of the Syrup of Roses solutive with the Water of Paul's Betony,
he vomited much viscid and choleric Stuff; afterward he was much better.

2. After this he conplained of great Heat as if hot Coals had been laid to his
Skin, therefere I, ordered him to take this purging physical Wine.

3. Take the Leaves of Sena, six dram: Raisons, two ounces: the Leaves and
Flowers of Fumitory, Epithymum, Dodder, Ceterach, Agrimony, Harts-Tougue, of
each one handful: the Leaves of Worm wood, Hysop, Germander, of each five
handfuls: the Roots of Bugloss, Elecampane, Avens, of each two drams: Ginger,
Cichory, black Hellebore, Agarick trochiscated, of each one ounce: Liquorish
scraped and split, five ounces: Anise and Fennel seeds, Cinnamon, of each two
scruples: the Flowers of Borage, Roses and Violets, of each one pugil:
Citron-Peels, five drams: choice Rhubarb, Mechoacan, of each two drams: Spike,
one scruple: being all bruised, cut, and mixed together put them into a Bagg
which is to be steeped in a Measure of Wine, of which the Patient drinking for
some days.

4. Great Obstructions and many Excrements were carried off and he recovered
his former Health. Gabelchoverus, Cent. 4. Cur. 59.

CVII. Convulsions in several Persons.

1. One called Ambrose, while he yawned, suddenly the lower Jaw remained
convulsed with great Grief and Pain, whom I cured with the Decoction of
Cammomil, Vervain through Wax, and such like, as before in our Cure of Luxation.

2. A young Man that was troubled with Spasmus Caninus, so that his Mouth was
drawn awry, I cured him by anointing the Reins of his Back with Balsamum
Helenii and Hederae, and by little and little drawing the place which was awry
to its form, with the gentle rubbing of my hand. Moreover I gave him in his
drink the Oil of Salt.

3. A certain Man of fifty years old was vexed with a Cramp, that his Head and
Neck were drawn down to his Breast, and could not lift nor stir it, unto whom I
applied Arcanum Magnetis, and the Oil of Salt, and so was cured. Paracelsus.

SCHOLIA. The THEORY of CONVULSIONS.
By the Author W. Salmon.
CVIII. The Pathology of Convulsions, and first of the Notation thereof.

1. The Names. It is called in Greek (...), in Latin Convulsio, in English a
Convulsion or Retraction.

2. The Definition. Convulsio Nervorum and Musculorum versus suum Caput,
Originemque violenta praeter Voluntatem contractio est, in qua voluntaria
Extensio Articulorum laeditur, and Membrum a Figura naturali detorquetur,
acerbissimoque dolor afficitur, A Convulsion is a forced Contraction of the
Nerves and Muscles toward their Original ( viz. the Brain and spinal Marrow)
wherein the voluntary Motion of the Joints is hurt, its natural Form and
Situation is depraved or changed, and the Parts affected are afflicted with a
most sharp Pain.

3. The Kinds or Differences. First the Kinds of Convulsions are chiefly four.
First, (...), Emprosthotonos, which is when the whole Body is bended or drawn
forwards. Secondly, (...), Opisthotonos, which is when the whole Body is
convulsed or drawn backwards. Thirdly, (...), Tetanos, which is when the
Convulsion is equally both ways, so that the whole Body is stiff like a Stake,
that it cannot be moved any ways. Fourthly, (...), Spasmos, a Convulsion; which
only happens to a particular Part, as the Hand, Arms, Legs, Thighs, Hips,
Bowels, Stomach, Neck, etc. Secondly, the Differences are known from the Causes
and Parts afflicted: and so a Convulsion is either Universal, afflicting the
whole Body, and arising from the Brain and spinal Marrow; of which kind are the
three first aforenamed: Or Particular afflicting some Part, as the Ey, Mouth,
Arm, Leg, etc. arising from a particular Nerve hurt, of which kind is the
fourth Species aforenamed. Thirdly, Some Authors make a Convulsion to be but
twofold, arising from opposite or contrary Causes, as Fullness and Emptiness.
Fourthly, Riverius make a Convulsion to be either proper or improper. The
Proper is that which agrees with the prime Definition at 2. above: The
Improper, says he, Is a convulsive Motion, and they are thus distinguished: In
a true Convulsion the Retraction of the Muscles is always; but in a convulsive
Motion, the Retraction is continually renewed; moreover, in a true Convulsion,
the convulsed Part is immovable; but in a convulsive Motion (the chief of
which is the Epilepsy) it may be moved diverse ways.

CIX. The Signs of a Convulsion.

1. The Diagnosis of a Convulsion is manifest from the Definition aforegoing,
and the Signs are easily learned, for in a true Convulsion, the Nerves and
Muscles are contracted, stiff, and immovable; the Part afflicted is distorted
and drawn out of its natural Shape, and afflicted with a most exquisite Pain.

2. The kind of the Convulsion is known from the manner of Retraction, whether
it be forwards or backwards, or both ways.

3. A Spasm or particular Convulsion is known from a forceable drawing up the
Nerves and Muscles of the Part afflicted, as it sometimes falls out under the
Chin by excessive yawning. In the Neck through Cold or some sudden Motion; so
likewise in the Mouth, Eyes, Hands, Arms, Fingers, Thighs, Legs, and Feet; and
sometimes there are remarkable Convulsions of the Stomach, Guts, Mesentery, and
other internal Parts.

4. If there be a Convulsion of the Stomach, it is known by exquisite Pain,
Vomiting, and sometimes by Fainting away and Swooning.

5. If there be a Convulsion of the Guts, it is known by the exquisite pain,
great tumbling of the Guts, and hardness of the Belly, and the sick by reason
of the torture is almost ready to go distracted.

6. If there be a Convulsion of the Nerves of the Mesentery or Diaphragma, the
Pain is more dull; there is a rising of something as it were out of the Belly
into the Stomach, great hard, and round (much like as in those which they call
Fits of the Mother) which at length by reason of its Prevalency and Force,
takes away the Senses of the sick, so as that they neither see, hear, or
understand any thing.

CX. The various Causes of a Convulsion.

1. The Causes of a Convulsion, whether they be (...) Proegoumenine or (...)
Procatartick, are manifold and various: the more frequent Cause is from an
Irritation of the Brain, pouring forth the Spirits into the Nerves, which
arises for the most part by consent from other Parts, and those sometimes far
distant from the Brain: as in a prick of a Nerve or Tendon; a vehement blow
upon any part, causing a concussion of the animal Spirits, and putting them
into disorder and confusion; the biting of a Serpent or Viper, or other
poisonous Beast; The hurting of the Nerves or Tendons with a poisonous Weapon,
which seizing upon the animal Spirits presently corrupts and poisons them,
whence arises immediately universal Convulsions over the whole Body.

2. The Cause of an universal Convulsion, is for the most part from a hurt of
the nervous System, together also with the Brain it self; from whence it is
that a Tetanos is always accounted the most dangerous, because it arises from a
complete hurt of the animal Spirits, both in the Brain and nervous System
whereas an Emprosthotonos and an Opisthotonos, are caused from a hurt of the
animal Spirits either in the Brain alone, or in the nervous System, according
to the Situation.

3. And therefore an Emprosthotonos is when the Body with the Head and Neck are
forceably contracted and drawn forwards, so that the Chin is joined to the
Breast, and the Body is in some measure turned round, not much unlike to the
Keel of a Ship; yea sometimes bended like a Bow, and sometimes round: sometimes
the Head of the Patient is joined to his Knees, and that is caused from the
Affection of two Muscles which bend the Head forwards.

4. An Opisthotonos is caused by a disaffection of the twelve Muscles, which
extend the Head, some or all of them being drawn together, by which means the
Head and Body are drawn backwards.

5. A Tetanos is caused from an equal contraction of the Muscles both before
and behind, whereby the Parts drawn by the opposite Muscles being as it were
balanced, they remain stiff and inflexable, which is called Motus Tonicus, and
is the most violent of all Convulsions, being caused from the contension or
disaffection of all the Muscles.

6. A Spasmos simply so called, is a particular Convulsion, caused by the
contraction of the Nerves and Muscles of some particular Part, which are
ordained for its Motion: from the Effects or Symptoms of which it sometimes has
a peculiar Name.

7. So the Convulsion of the Muscles which move the Eye is called Strabismus; A
Convulsion of the Muscles of the Jaws and Temples is called (...) Trismos: the
Convulsion of the Mouth which is caused by a contraction of the Musculus latus
on the one side is called Spasmos Cynicus, a Dog-like Convulsion, wherein the
Mouth is wrested aside: but if the contraction of the said Musculus latus be on
both sides, it is called Risus Sardonicus, or a grinning. But there may be a
wryness of the Mouth without a Convulsion, which may be made from the
resolution of one Muscle, which causes the Muscle on the other side to draw the
Lips to the sound Part, whence comes a Distortion: the Convulsions of other
Parts want proper Names.

8. But the immediate Cause of a Convulsion, as Hippocrates and Galen and
others deriving from them say, is from Repletion and Inanition, viz, Fullness
and Emptiness: This Opinion is confirmed by the Example of a Lute or
Harp-strings, which are commonly stretched out. For (says Galen) while the
strings are moist and filled with humor (as it falls out when the Wind is
Southerly) they are swelled and stretched, and so broken: and when they are
over dry (as it happens when the Wind is Northen) then they are contracted, and
so also broken.

9. The same thing befalls the Nerves, which being either too full of Moisture
or too dry, are stretched and contracted; and the Muscles in which they are
united, are so drawn back to their Principal or Original, that thereby a
Convulsion is immediately excited.

10. But by reason a Palsy is also caused from a Water overflowing the Nerves,
it is doubtful how a Convulsion should arise from the same Cause, they being as
it were Diseases opposite; the one being a Resolution of the Nerves and
Muscles, the other a contraction of the same. This has made Physicians much
divided among themselves; and the most ingenious Galenists, have confessed it a
Problem beyond their Capacities to resolve: Averroes said, The former reason of
Galen (at 8. above) was more fit for a Fiddler than a Demonstrator. And
Argenterius says, It is not easy to render a reason of all things, and
especially why Water, which is said to be the Cause of the Palsy, or Resolution
of the Nerves, and of a Convulsion or Contraction of the same, should sometimes
produce one Disease, and sometimes another, when it is the same matter, and the
same Parts that are affected, to wit, the Nerves; why should not then the same
Disease be always produced?

11. The great difficulty of solving this Paradox, is that which has divided
almost all Authors, and filled them with contradictions and Nonsense; insomuch
as several learned Men, to wit, Averroes, Erastus, Cesalpinus, Platerus,
Sennertus, and others have justly deserted this opinion, whose long
disputations and various reasons would be too long here to relate. However
Riverius is very unwilling to quit the sense of Hippocrates and Galen, and
therefore he expounds them thus: Therefore (says he) although we cannot
satisfy our selves in this great difficulty, while better Arguments are
propounded, suppose that those Objections may be taken off thus: A Convulsion
and a Palsy, differ in this; a Palsy is made of a pure watery humor without
mixture, which does not extend the parts, but only softens them, as we see in
the tumor Oedema: but a Convulsion is caused of the same humor, but not pure
and simple, but mixed with much wind, by which wind the Nerves are stretched,
and the Mucles also, which are contracted to their Original: for no cause can
be thought more fit to make so great a contraction, than Wind, which Galen
acknowledges de sympt. cause. lib. 2. cap. 2. and Experience teaches, us, that
the greatest distentions are made especially by Wind, as we may see in the
Dropsy Tympanites and the Cholick; and in Convulsions, those are the greatest,
which are caused of Wind, which stretches and distend the parts. River. pax.
lib. 1. cap. 6.

12. Although we are here unwilling to undertake the answering of Riverius in
this case; yet we may make bold to tell him, that in an Oedema, there is as
well Tumor and Extension as softness of the matter; and if the humor be the
same in both, as he seems to consent to, what Reason is there, That it should
not as well extend the Nerve in the Belly of the Muscle, where it has more
liberty to play, as well as it does the Tendons and parts adjacent to them in a
Joint, where it has less liberty.

13. Moreover for the Nature and Quality of the humor which he thinks may cause
the Convulsions, he, it is to be feared, as much mistakes it; for many, yea
most things which cause vehement extentions, will cause no Convulsion at all:
and his parallel of the Dropsy Tympanites makes vastly more against than his
Argument will do for him, for that in the Tympanites where the extension is so
eminently great and that among Muscular and Nervous parts, yet is there not the
least appearance of a Convulsion, nor any inclination or disposition of the
parts to such a disaffection.

14. And since Convu^sions are often caused where neither fullness nor emptiness
are previous (as in a prick of a Nerve or Tendon) it is manifest that some
other cause is attendent; and that the Animal spirits are the principal objects
of the matter causing, whose disaffection and hurt, are the near and conjunct
cause of this D^sease: for as much as the said spirits being disturbed and hurt
in any part, there is presently an afflux of (as it were) a troop or Army of
Spirits, which Nature immediately sends to the relief of those in the part
afflicted; whence, by reason of their rushing force, and vast flux from their
fountain the Brain; the Nerve (if it be particular,) Or the Genus Nervosum (if
it be general) are infinitely extended, and shrunk up, and that with a vehement
and almost intolerable pain, the which is excited not only from the hurt of
those Animal spirits in the place pricked, or Genus Nervosum, otherwise hurt,
but from the violent rushing and Collision of the said spirits one against
another, by reason of their tumultuous occurse in order to the relief of Nature.

15. Now the reason why universal Convulsions are so dangerous (as for the most
part bringing Death, is either from the exquisite pain overcoming all the
Spirits; or from the extreme extention of all the Muscles, whereby the drawing
of the breath is hindered, and suffocation in a short time ensues: If the
affect or hurt of any particular part be small, it causes that Nerve or Muscle
only to suffer, and so the Convulsion is only particular: but if it be very
great and extreme, then the whole Genus Nervosum, or nervous System suffers
also, so that indeavering to shake off that which does offend it, it does
therewith exagitate the Brain, and so draws it into consent, whereby the
Convulsion becomes Universal over the whole body; and the Symptoms seem to be
so extreme, that by reason of the great Flux of Spirits from the Brain, and
their wanderings up and down, it does as it were cease from its Functions till
such time as they return again.

16. And after the same manner as a Convulsion is caused by a prick of a Nerve
or Tendon through an enraging of the animal Spirits so vehemently as to bring
the Brain into consent; so it is likewise caused by the biting of a Viper or
other venomous Creature, by a Wound made with a poisonous Weapon, or Poisons
taken inwardly; or things of a vehement sharp or malign quality, as Spirit of
Nitre, Oil of Vitriol, Aqua Fortis, etc. by which the said Spirits are
immediately corrupted and polluted; and in whose defense by reason of the
effusion of Spirits into the Nerves out of the Brain, the motive Power of the
Nerves and Muscles are more strongly than ordinary excited to exercise their
Faculties, but with so much violence and inordinacy to expel their Enemy, that
forthwith the Tumor and lateral Extension of the Nerve is made, which is the
modificative or formal Cause of the Disaffection.

17. Now in this Case, if by this great affluense of Spirits, the Poison or
corrupted Matter is overcome, there is presently a cessation of the Fit; but
whilst with equal Force they hold the Contest, the Fit continues: and if the
poisonous Matter or Enemy proves too strong for the Forces which are sent in to
natures relief, the sick for the most part dies in the Fit.

18. Nor is the Case very different where the remote Cause is from Worms in the
Bowels, or the vehemence of Cathartick and Emetick Medicaments taken inwardly,
which stimulate the expulsive Faculty of the Stomach and Guts, and too much
excite those Parts, such are several malign Preparations of Antimony,
Euphorbium, Hellebor, Spurge, Asarabacca, Aron roots, and other things of like
quality, which too violently solicit nature at once both by vomiting and
stool, which sometimes by their Vehemence produce even deadly Convulsions: and
after the same manner all sharp and acrid humors whether Choler, Phlegm, or
Melancholy, falling upon the Nerves, and by their Acrimony exciting Pain, cause
Convulsions and convulsive Motion: and this is evident in the Cholick, Fits of
the Mother, Epilepsies, and other Diseases akin to them.

19. And indeed when, and wheresoever the animal Spirits are hurt, corrupted,
or assaulted by any foreign, sharp, malign, poisonous, or heterogene matter,
even then, and there, will Convulsions certainly be produced, whose strength
and force will be according to the strength and force of the matter assaulting
or offending: if it be little and weak, the Convulsion will be small and
inconsiderable: But if it be great and strong, the Convulsion excited will also
be answerable: If this Assault be begun in the Brain, the disaffection will be
the more admirable and acute, and for the most part is mortal: But if it
happens in any other part of the Genus Nervosum, the danger and magnitude of
the Disease will be according to the Part or Parts afflicted.

20. Moreover in a Spasm or Cramp, which is a particular or singular
Convulsion; that which happens in the extreme Parts, as the Hands, Arms, Thigh,
Hips, Legs, or Feet, or in the Neck, or under the Chin, is caused for the most
part through a sharp and sudden Cold, which giving a disaffection to the animal
Spirits, immediately causes them to tumultuate and assemble themselves
together, in order to expel their Adversary, from whence arises by reason of
their so hasty Unition and Affluence to the part, not only a Collision, whence
is in part the extremity of the Pain, but also from their too abundant Afflux,
a great and hard Tumor in the Nerve and Muscle; which by reason of the
sensibleness and tenderness of the Part, adds also to the anguish of the
sensitive Soul, for that there is a great lateral extension, whereby the Nerve
or Tendon is contracted in Longitude.

21. A convulsive Motion is caused for the most part from a sharp and pricking
matter, which provokes the Nerves, but after a differing manner afflicts the
animal Spirits: for in a true Convulsion, that which afflicts the animal
Spirits, seizes upon them, and is joined fast to them, so as that it can by no
means be removed, till Nature overcoming and casting it off, the Fit ceases to
be at present, and the contraction is resolved: but in a convulsive Motion, the
matter causing it, is not fixed fast to the Spirits, but is loose and apt to
slide off, being a spirituous humor or vapor full of acrimony and malignity,
as is often generated in malignant Fevers.

22. These convulsive Motions, are also caused for the most part from the Brain
and Nerves suffering by Sympathy, Consent, or Compassion, as we may more
properly speak, and then we call it Convulsio sympathetica. This Sympathy is
either from their simple suffering together in respect of Similitude in
Substance and Faculties: Or from their proximity or neerness; Or from a
spirituous Poison and Malignity invading the Original of the Nerves: And it is
many times caused by consent from the Mouth of the Stomach, through an
aeruginous or cankred Choler made spirituous or volatile, or joined to some
malign volatile Salt: Or through Worms, Poison, or other sharp Matter which
gripes and gnaws or corrodes the Bowels: Or from consent with the Womb,
Mesentery, Diaphragma, or Praecordia, as it oftentimes falls out in Hysterical
Fits, Swoonings, Swellings of the Stomach, Suffocation, etc.

CXI. Of the Prognostics of Convulsions.

1. Universal Convulsions are much more dangerous than such as are particular,
by so much as the hurt of the whole nervous System exceeds the hurt of a
particular Nerve.

2. Convulsions in many parts, especially in those near the Brain are very
dangerous: so also those which are in the Muscles of the Breast; because they
hinder breathing, and may suddenly endanger suffocation.

3. Convulsions in Infants are much more dangerous than in those of Elder
years: and they are for the most part mortal in very aged people; because of
weakness, and the continual exhausting (through the lesitude of the Pores) of
the Animal Spirits: so also if it comes of too much bleeding, or vehement
Purging, for the same reason; and in these two latter cases it is for the most
part mortal.

4. Hippocrates says, sect. 2. Aph. 37. that it is better that a Fever
follows a Convulsion, than a Convulsion a Fever; for a Fever coming upon a
Convulsion, by its excessive heat, warms the parts, and dissolves the
Convulsion by taking away the cause: but on the contrary, a Convulsion coming
upon a Fever, shows Malignancy, and is for the most part deadly.

5. Convulsions coming upon the taking of Poison, are generally mortal; unless
the Poison can be forthwith retracted.

6. A Convulsion arising upon Frensy is deadly: Aetius says, That he never
hard of any that was so taken that ever recovered: and the reason is plain,
because the Animal Spirits are assaulted in their Original or Fountain, and the
Convulsion is of the whole nervous system.

7, A Tetanos is said to be Mortal within four days; but says Hippocrates,
sect. 5. Aph. 6. if it continues longer, it is cured: for the great stretching
of all the Muscles, hinders breathing, so that suffocation follows, and from
thence death: now the Convulsion is not the cause of Death, as to the hurt don
to the Nerves, but the suffocation; by reason of the Convulsion of the Nerves
and Muscles ordained for breathing.

8. By so much the more vehement the Convulsion is, by so much the more
dangerous it is: the farther the Convulsion is from the Brain, so much the less
dangerous it is.

9. A Convulsion is much more easily cured if the Brain be only affected by
consent, than if it be essentially and primarily affected: Hippocrates also
says, sect. 5. Aphor. 1. that Convulsions caused by taking of Hellebor are
mortal; and this I saw experienced, upon several persons at one time, who had
taken Hellebor for the Worms.

10. A Convulsion arising from the Iliack passion, is dangerous, especially if
it be accompanied with the Hic^ough: so also if swooning immediately follow it.

11. Convulsions arising from extreme Pains of the Bowels, or parts adjacent
to the lower Viscera, are evil. sect. 7. Aph. 67. and the reason is because the
Brain is forthwith drawn into consent.

12: Convulsions in continual Fevers, where the sick is very weak, especially
if they seize upon the Lips, Nostrils, Eyes, Eyelids, Eyebrows, or Parts near
them, foreshew that death is at the Door.

13. Convulsions arising from continual watchings or long fasting, are mortal,
for that there is not only a diminution of the animal Spirits, but an almost
abolition of the natural heat, and radical humidity, which ought to conserve
and support the Spirits.

14. Lastly. Hippocrates says, Sect. 5 Aph. 2. that Convulsions proceeding
from Wounds are pernicious, more especially if they be near the Brain; for
there is danger (from the great Inflammation) of Mortification of the Part, and
from thence Death.

CXII. Of the Cure of a singular Convulsion or Cramp.

1. The Cramp as is for the most part caused of Gold, afflicting the Nerves and
Muscles of the Part: so it is to be cured by the help of such things as warm
and comfort the same, having also a specific Property to be assistant to the
Nerves.

2. In the first place, if the Body be full of evil humous you may purge the
Patient with my Family-Pills, or with the tincture of the same: and because we
must prosecute the Cure according to the Indications, which offer themselves,
you may know the strength or debility of the Stomach, and accordingly give
things cleansing or strengthening: if the Stomach be foul you may exhibit a
Dose of my vomiting Lozenges, which may be given from fifteen to thirty grains
according to age and strength: yet they may be taken in the Morning fasting,
and let a good quantity of broth or posset drink be prepared to be taken, they
will work well, and call the offending humor from all parts of the Body; and
after they have cleansed the Stomach upwards, they will then work admirably
well, and purge the Bowels downward.

3. This being done, a Diet of Neuroticks ought to be prepared after the manner
of a constant Drink; but because that may be troublesome, I shall advise to
something which may with more ease and convenience be done, and what Experience
has confirmed to me will be of great advantage to the sick, and that is the
Queen of Hungaria's Water, a Medicament scarcely inferior to any: let it be
taken constantly three times a day (a little before eating) viz. Morning, Noon,
and Night; and oftener if the Patient so pleases, in a glass of Sack, or of some
cordial Water.

4. This being taken for about 10 or 12 days, the sick ought to use sudorifick
means, by taking inwardly, English Bezoar, Bezoar mineral, Bezoar animal,
Electuarium ad Tabidos, Powers of Vipers, or our Guttae Vitae, mixed and made up
into a Bolus with the choicest Venice Treacle, or dissolved and given in Spirit
of Saffron, or in this following Compositum: Take Spirit of Saffron, two
ounces: Syrup of Lemons, one ounce: Salt of Vipers, eight grains: mix them for
a sudorifick Dose. Or this: Take choice Cinnamon Water, an ounce: Syrup of
Citrons, six drams: Powers of Vipers, twelve drops: mix for a dose. Or this:
Take Treacle Water, two ounces: Syrup of Lemons, one ounce: Electuarium ad
Tabidos, one dram: Guttae Vitae, ten drops: mix for a Dose to sweat withal.

5. But during the time that all these things are doing, we must not be
unmindful of the application of Topics to the part affected, without which
almost all other things will nearly be done in vain: for this purpose we
commend to the sick the Queen of Hungaries water, a most excellent thing to
bath withal: let the place pained be bathed therewith thrice a day, and let it
be done almost half an hour together, it is a Medicament of great Virtue and
has cured hundreds.

6. But that which transcends all others things, and which we can commend upon
our own manifold Experience, are the Powers of Amber, a Medicament never to be
sufficiently praised; for by the single use of this alone Medicament I can
safely say it, I have cured several scores of the Cramp, so perfectly, as that
it never has returned any more: I could advise to many other excellent things,
which I know would not fail also, but this being the cheapest, easiest to come
by, and of most approved use, I advise to the use of it above all other things;
and they that shall be pleased to make use of it, shall find I have spoken a
very great Truth.

CXIII. Of the cure of a general and Primary Convulsion.

1. The first essay which Authors make toward the cure of a Convulsion, is to
evacuate the Corrupt and morbifick humor abounding; for which Physicians
prescribe many ways, as first Blood-letting: But this as it diminishes the
Spirits and obliterates the strength and vigor of the Body, so ought it to be
cautiously attempted, for in this Disease we ought rather to contrive how to
augment the natural forces of the Body and conserve the spiritual parts than to
diminish them, which this operation certainly does; whereupon death, in some,
immediately follows, as I have two or three times observed from unadvised
bleeding in this Disease, the Patient dying in little more than half an hour
after; the cause of which doubtless was the defect and diminution of Spirits.
Riverius (one much for bleeding) says, That it is only to be don, if the Patient
be strong, and that it is better to take away too little Blood than too much,
for that Blood opposes the principal cause of the Disease which is Phlegm. If
this be true, in what Meanders of folly do Physicians wander, who attempt the
cure by this kind of method, viz. by taking away that matter which opposes the
Disease? but these Vanities are so gross and absurd, that they are not worth
disputing about, and so deserve no Answer.

2. In an universal Convulsion, however evacuations are proposed; first
Revulsive, chiefly by strong Clysters, such as are commonly exhibited in
Palsies; and of which this following may be an example: Take Mutton-broth, one
pound: Tincture of Colocynthis, infusion of Crocus Metallorum, of each two
ounces: Oil of Dill, three ounces: syrup of Roses solutive, two ounces and
half: Chemical Oil of sweet Fennel seeds, six drops or somewhat more: mix and
give it warm: This as occasion requires may be repeated again.

3. If age and strength admit, you may apply Cupping-glases with
scarrification, to the Shoulders, Hips, Thighs, or Legs; if the Convulsion be
particular, it will be requisite, that their application, be at a large
distance from the part affected: but if the Patient be willing to admit of
Cupping; 'twil be then necessary instead thereof to apply a Vesicatory: these
things ought to be don, say some Authors, first to the remote parts, then to
the parts near the part affected: but if the Thighs or Legs have a Convulsion,
then the Cups or Vesicatory, are to be applied to the Buttocks and Loins, if
the Arms, then to the Neck and Shoulders, endeavoring always to bring the humor
back to its Original: And these operations are to be don (say some) after
purging; but according to others before purging: Others say, That if purging
went not before, you are to apply them without Scarrification, but after
purging with it: However in my opinion, if necessity require this kind of
external Evacuation, Vesicatories are to be preferred before Cupping for many
respects.

4. In the next place (if you find the Head afflicted) you may purge and
cleanse it by Errhines, sternutatories, Masticatories, Apophlegmatisms,
Gargarisms and such like, which evacuate powerfully noxious humors. An Errhine:
Take juice of Marjoram and Sage, of each two ounces: juice of Beets and Betony,
of each one ounce: juice of Pyrethrum, half an ounce: mix and make an Errhine
to be taken up the Nostrills. Or Thus, Take white Wine, half a pint:
Euphorbium, ten grains: dissolve it in Wine, and use it to the Nostrills as
aforesaid; it draws much humor from the Brain, and parts adjacent.

5. A Sernutatory for this purpose: Take dried leaves of Rosemary, Sage,
Lavender, sweet Marjoram, of each half a dram: Pelitory, of Spain, Ginger,
white Hellebor, of each a scruple: Musk, ten grains: mix them in a fine powder.
Let it be drawn up the Nostrills; or otherwise blown up with a Quill. Or thus:
Take Orrice root, Ginger, Nutmeg, Caraways, of each a scruple: Rosemary,
Castoreum, Euphorbium, of each half a scruple: Ambergrise, Musk, of each four
grains: make a powder for the same intention. But some Authors say, that the
chief sneezing powder is made of black Hellebor, with an equal weight of
Sugar Candy finely poudred. Or thus: Take black Hellebor in fine powder,
Pyrethrum, of each half a dram: Orrice, Zedoary, Ginger, Caraways, of each half
a scruple: Musk, six grains: mix and make a sneezing powder. Or thus: Take
black Hellebor, Ginger, Orrice in powder, of each half a dram: Tobacco in fine
powder, a dram and half: Musk, seven grains: mix and make a powder.

6. Masticatories: Take Ginger, Pyrethrum, of each two drams: Mustard-seeds,
one dram: Euphorbium, five grains: make them up with Wax, into little balls, of
which let one be chewed Morning and Evening, holding down the Head. The root
Gentian chewed alone, all day long in the Mouth (except at meals) being used
for some days, is of singular use above most other things: and in small
Convulsions they may use Flower-deluce roots for the same purpose. Or thus:
Take Ginger, Pyrethrum, Staves-acre, of each a scruple: Nutmegs, Rocket seeds,
Cardamoms, of each half a scruple: Mastick, half a dram: with white Wax make
little balls as before.

7. Gargarisms: Take Ginger, Mustard-seeds, of each half an ounce: Staves-acre,
Carraways, of each three drams: Pyrethrum, one dram: Aqua Mellis, a quarter of
a pint: boil them together, and dissolve therein Honey of squills, three
ounces. Or thus: Take Staves-acre, half an ounce: Mustard-seeds, three drams:
Pelitory of Spain, one dram: grains of Paradise, half a dram: boil them in
water and Honey, to three ounces: to which add Vinegar of Squills, two ounces.
Or thus: Take Rocket-seed, Radish-seed, Mustard seed, of each half an ounce:
boil in Mead, to four ounces: dissolve therein white Vitriol, half a dram: and
being cold strain it and keep it for use: It is the best of all Gargarisms, for
it draws away vast quantities of humors by spitting, as though the Patient was
in a Flux and yet with much safety. Now in the use of these Medicaments you
must note, that those things which evacuate by the Palate, are much more
beneficial than those things, which operate by otherways, because nature has
ordained that as the chief or principal way by which the Head and Brain is to
be cleansed: also evacuation by the way of the Pallet is more safe, for the
Brain is not so shaked by it, as by sneezing: But Errhines draws forth the
matter yet more violently, for that they stir up the very substance of the
Brain it self.

8. The next thing which we are to consider of, is Purgation; which you may
perform with these following things: Take Pil. de Agarico, Pil. Cochiae, of
each half a dram: Pil. Bontii, a scruple: Elaterium, four grains: mix and make
a Mass of Pills for three Doses. Or, Take Pil. Cochiae, Pil. Aloephanginae,
Troches Alhandal, of each half a dram: mix and make a Mass for three Doses, as
aforesaid: Or, you may give of our Family-Pills, half a dram at a time, they
work admirably, and carry away the morbifick Cause to a wonder.

9. A Potion. Take Sena, five drams: Aniseeds, Cloves, of each half a dram:
Mint, Betony, of each half an handful: Tops of Time, one pugil: boil in
spring water to a quarter of a pint: strain, and infuse in it Agarick
trochiscated, two scruples: Rhubarb, one scruple: Cinnamon, half a scruple:
strain it again, and mix therewith four ounces of Syrup of Buckthorn: let it be
given at two or three times, according to age and strength. Or, Take Sena,
Rhubarb, of each six drams: Cinnamon Water, eight ounces: infuse four and
twenty hours, and then decant the clear, for three Doses.

10. Bolus. Take Diacarthamum, Diacatholicon, Diaphanicon, of each six drams:
Confectio Hamech, half an ounce: mix and make a Bolus for four ^^ses. Or thus.
Take Diacatholicon and Diaphaenicon, of each half an ounce: mix and make a
Bolus with a little white Sugar. But if with these Purges you mix Neuroticks,
they will be so much the more powerful. As in Example: Take Diacarthamum, six
drams: Castoreum in Powder, a scruple: Nutmegs in Powder, ten grains: Oil of
Lavender, gut. ij: mix and make a Bolus, to be given in the Morning fasting,
and to be repeated twice or thrice, if need be.

11. Pouders. Take Sena, Turbith, Rhubarb, of each two scruples: Diagredium or
Scammony, half a dram: make a fine Powder for four Doses. Or thus: Take Sena,
Scammony, of each a scruple: Cambogia, Jallap, of each half a scruple: Crocus
Metallorum in fine Powder, eight grains: mix and make a Powder for three Doses.
Or thus: Take Scammony, Cambogia, of each one scruple: Crocus Metallorum, ten
grains: mix for two Doses, in a strong Person. Now in the giving of these
things you must be sure that the Body of the sick be open: if it be bound, you
must loosen it with an emollient Clyster, or with some such as we have above
taught. Moreover in weak Persons you may give our Family-Pouder, or the Pulvis
ex tribus; but in such as are very strong and robustick, our Royal Powder,
which see in our Doron Medicum, Lib. 2. Cap. 21. Sect. 41.

12. After purging, yea in the very time of purging, it will be necessary to
give such things as strengthen and corroborate the Head, Stomach, Nerves and
animal Faculties: This Orvietan of Platerus is for this purpose comme^d^d: Take
Roots of Gentian, Bistort, Carline, Tormentil, white Dittander, Callamus
Aromaticus, round Birthwort, Doronicum, Carduus Benedictus, Seeds of Vipers,
Bugloss, Alkanet, Citron, of each an ounce: make them all into a fine Powder;
to which add Roots of Scorzonera poudred, the weight of them all: clarified
Honey, six pounds with a little generous Wine: boil them together; and at the
end of the boiling add Venice-Treacle, a pound and half: mix and make an
Electuary, which keep for Use. But the Medicament would be much the better if
you should add thereto the Viper-Pouder, ten ounces: Castoreum, six ounces:
volatile Salt of Hearts horn, four ounces: Musk, two ounces: Ambergrise, one
ounce: Juice of Alkermes, one pound: By the means of this addition, it would be
inferior to few other corroborating Medicaments: Or in place of this
Composition you may give of our Electuarium ad Tabidos, from half a dram to a
dram, Morning and Night in generous Wine.

13. Or if the sick cannot take the Electuaries aforesaid, we commend the
Powers of Vipers, which may be given from six drops to fifteen or twenty in a
glass of Sack, Morning and Night; this mightily comforts all the animal
Faculties; and not much inferior is the Salt of Hearts horn and Powers of Man's
skull: but the volatile Salt of Man's skull, and volatile Salt of Vipers vastly
transcend all other Neuroticks, being given in such thing as are cordial and
fortifying of the Faculties of the Stomach; they may be given either of them
from three grains to eight, Morning and Night, in the intervals of purging.

14 The morbifick Cause being thus in part abated or taken away; it is
necessary that we come now to internal Corroboratives and Specificks, to be
used in good earnest, or without interruption of Medicaments of any other kind;
among which we commend these even but now enumerated: but because those
Medicines are not only great things, and many times, difficult to come by, but
also above the Capacities of many vulgar People, in respect to the price; we
shall descend (for the sakes of the meaner sort of People) to show variety of
more common Medicines, which although they may not be of so great Power and
Force as these but now mentioned, yet have been found by manyfold Experiments,
to be Specificks of no mean Worth: We are also more the willing (not only in
this Case, but in all other Diseases we shall have Opportunity to treat of) to
show great variety of Medicaments of all kinds and forms; for the
difference-sake of places; for that various places afford various Medicaments,
and as one place cannot afford all Medicaments fit for the same purpose; so
neither can one Medicament (be it almost what it will) be found in all places.

15. For this purpose therefore we commend the following Neuroticks:

16. Out of all this great Variety, where choice is to be had, you ought to
elect the best things, and therefore out of what we have already enumerated
these are chief: Oil of Cinnamon, Spirit of Vipers, and of Man's skull, the
animal Bezoar, volatile Salt of Urine, and of Hartshorn, volatile Sal
Armoniack; Spirit, Tincture, volatile Salt, and Powers of Castoreum, volatile
Salt of Vipers, and of Man's skull, Powers of Lavender, Rosemary, Sassafras, and
Limons, Powers of Virtues, volatile Salt, Spirit and Powers of Amber,
Viper-Wine, Powers of Cloves, Powder, Tincture and Powers of Musk and
Ambergrise, (than which nothing is yet found to be more powerful) you may give
Musk or Ambergrise from five grains to a scruple, in any convenient Vehicle;
and their Tincture and Powers from ten grains to twenty thirty forty or fifty,
according to age and strength. To these things we may add, volatile Salt of
Peacocks, of Magpies, and of Swallows; Powers of the same Animals: and volatile
Salt and Powers of their Dung, which are of no mean use; together with the
volatile Salt and Powers of Ox-horns, Rams-horns, Elks hoofs, and Horse-skulls,
which last thing has been found to do Wonders in Convulsions, and convulsive
Motions.

17, The most learned Sennertus says, That Castoreum given in powder in any
convenient Vehicle, is of great force and power: so also the Essence of
Castoreum extracted with Spirit of Wine, and given to five or seven drops, (yea
to twenty if you think fit) in Sage-water, and also bathed upon the part
affected is excellent. Or thus: Take Electuarium Diacori, an ounce and half:
Conserve of Sage-flowers, of Betony, of each one ounce: roots of Pyrethrum
candied, three drams: choice Treacle of Andromachus, one dram: Mithridate,
species D^acastorei, of each half a dram: extract of Peony roots, one scruple:
and with syrup of Staechas make an Electuary; of which let the quantity of a
Nutmeg be taken Morning and Evening. Or thus: Take conserves of Peony and of
Rosemary, of each one ounce: Marjoram, Betony, of each half an ounce: Primroses
or Cowslips, three drams: ^ugloss, two drams: powder of Carduus-seeds, of
Fennel-seeds, of each one dram: Peony roots, four scruples: Nutmegs preserved,
two drams and half: Citron-peels candied, green Ginger preserved, of each one
ounce and six drams: Galangal condited, Calamus Aromaticus, of each a dram and
half: cut them which are to be cut, mix them, and with syrup of Peony, beat
them in a mortar to an Electuary.

18. The same Sennertus commends the famous compound water of Swallows, which
he prepares after this manner: Take young Swallows (from their nests) number
sixty: cleanse them from their filth; bruise them in a mortar, and affuse upon
them, Mallago Wine, three pints: or a sufficient quantity: seeds of hart-wort,
of Carduus-Benedictus, of each half an ounce: Calamus Aromaticus, long Cyperus,
of each two drams: leaves of Marjoram and of Rue, of each half a handful:
raspings of Hartshorn, Misleto of the Oak, Elks hoof, of each half an ounce:
Peony roots gathered in the (decrease of the Moon, say Authors, but I say in)
the increase, two ounces: Castoreum, one ounce: let them stand in digestion for
ten or fourteen days: then distill them in Balneo Maris, or in Sand. Some in
making of this water, take Vinegar or juice of Limons instead of the Mallago
Wine, and then it is called Aqua hirundinum acida, as the former, is called
Aqua hirundinum dulcis. Dose is from half a dram to an ounce, Pro ratione
aetatis, and it is given either alone, or mixed with Sugar, or with double
quantity of Tile flowers water, or water of Lilly Convally.

19. This Electuary is very much commended: Take Castoreum, Sagapenum,
Opopanax, of each one dram: Succus Cyreniacus, a dram and half: Acorus,
Scordium, of each two drams and half: of the three kinds of Pepper, Sch^nanth,
Carraways, of each two drams: Asarum, squills roasted, of each one dram and
half: Orrice roots, seeds of Smallage, Mastick, of each one dram: juice of
Arabian staechas, one ounce: Honey of Roses a sufficient quant^ty, beat them
which are to be beaten, and make an Electuary according to Art. Dose half a
dram: cum Aqua mulsa, Morning and Night. Aegineta, de re medica, lib. 3. cap.
10. commends the root of Acanthus, and the seed of the Milk-thistle, as also
the juice of the lesser Centuary, which may be exhibited in Aqua Mulsa: and
Cardanus, de curationibus admirandis, cap. 15. cured an Opisthotonos, by
anointing the Neck and parts convulsed with Oils of Cammomil and Lillys made
warm, and keeping them continually upon the places with Lint, giving also
inwardly Mithridate, Electuarium de Moscho, with Oriental pearls, Jacynths and
Emeralds.

20. As for Diet, We shall not be very curious in prescription: for a constant
drink, the sick ought to take a mean decoction of Guajacum, Sassaphras, and
Sarsaparilla, made with Spring Water, Aniseeds, Carraways, Raisons of the Sun,
Currants, Liquorice, adding a little Wine at the end of the boiling; which being
strained and made pleasant with Sugar, and then bottled up with a Clove slit in
each bottle; may then be taken as ordinary drink: this hinders the generation
of the pituitous humor, consumes what already adheres to the Nerves, and
strengthens them.

21. But if all the things hitherto named performs nothing, you must then have
recourse (as to the Ultimum Asylum) to Opiates: Such are Our Confectio Anodyna,
Theriaca Londinensis nostra, Electuary of Opium, Elixir of Opium, Essence of
Opium, Laudanum Solidum nostrum, Extractum Opij Anodynum, Gutta vitae, Our
liquid Laudanum, Pillulae Anodynae nostrae, and spiritus Anodynus, of which Our
Guttae vitae, and solid Laudanum are thought to transcend, having been found
experimental specificks in this case. The Guttae vitae may be given a gut. six
ad twenty or thirty or more according to age and strength: Or, if the sick had
rather have a Pill, then you may give Our sollid Laudanum, from two grains to
five, six, seven, eight or ten, according to age, strength, and custom of
taking it: you may begin first with two grains, and continue it a week,
afterward increasing it a grain every week, so long as the sick shall find
need to take it.

22. These things being don, we now come to Topics, or application of
Externals, among which Sennertus commends these. Oils of Foxes, of Castoreum,
Fat of Whelps prepared, wild-Goose grease, Oleum Philosophorum, Chemical Oils
of Juniper, of Bays, of Rue, of Turpentine, Petroleum, Balsamum sulphuris; gum
of Ivy; Ammoniacum, Galbanum, and Oil or Balsam of Galbanum, which according to
Sennertus in his Institutes, lib. 5. par. 3. sect. 3. cap. 34. is thus made:
Take Galbanum, half a pound: clear Oil of Turpentine, two pounds: digest them
in a glass-Cucurbit in a gentle heat for ten or fourteen days, then distill. To
the distilled liquor add Oil of Lavender, one ounce: and distill again, so have
you the Balsam or Oil, which being circulated with Spirit of Wine; will be most
efficacious and penetrating; and will give present ease in all Gouts and
Cholick pains proceeding from cold, more especially if mixed with Oil of Venice
soap, and anointed upon the Navel and parts adjacent. Or thus: Take Oils of
Turpentine, and Earthworms, of each an ounce and half: Man's grease, one ounce:
Dogs grease, half an ounce: mix them and anoint therewith. Or thus: Take
Vnguentum Dialthaea, six ounces: Oils of Turpentine, and of Camomil, of each
one ounce: Oil of Lavender, three drams: Oils of Cloves, Cinnamon, and wood of
Aloes, of each one dram and half: Liquid styrax, and styrax Calamita, of each
two drams: mix and make an Unguent. Or thus: Take Oils of Dill and Camomil, of
each one dram: Vnguentum Martiatum, half an ounce: Oil of Peter, and of Spike,
of each one dram: spirit of Wine, three drams: mix them. Or thus: Take Oil of
Bays, two drams: Oil of Spice, of Foxes and of Earthworms, of each one dram
and half: Chemical Oils of Amber, and of Galbanum, of each six drops: Oils of
Rue and Dill, of each four drops: Oil of Nutmegs by expression, one dram and
half: mix them to anoint with. Or thus: Take a Weasle cut it into bits; put it
into a fat Goose, adding Pyrethrum, Sage, Lavender, Mustard Seed, Castoreum,
with such other like things let it be roasted with a gentle fire, and the fat
that drops from the same keep for use to anoint withal: the parts afflicted
being anointed therewith, let them be wraped up in a Fox, or wild Cats-skin.

23. Moreover Baths may be made of proper herbs, with the addition of a third
part of Oil; Or, a proper Oil may be fitted to anoint the parts affected with
immediately after bathing. Some use a decoction, or broth of Foxes flesh, which
is indeed a good Anodyn, V. G. Take flesh of Foxes separated from the bones,
two pounds: common Salt, two handfuls: boil in Water and Oil, and make a Bath
thereof: with which bath for two or three hours at a time, several days
together. Or thus: Take Agrimony, Betony, Fennel, of each a handful and half:
Sage, Camomil, Pennyroyal, Ground pine, of each one handful: Origanum,
Calamint, Marjoram, Hyssop, Time, Hypericon, Staechas of both sorts, of each
half a handful: Dill, Mellilot, Bawm, of each two pugils: mix and with water
and Oil make a Bath. Or Thus: Take leaves of Bays, Rosemary, of each a handful
and half: red Roses, two handfuls: Time, half a handful: Lavender-flowers,
three ounces: Orice-roots, four ounces: Cinnamon, one ounce: Mace, a dram: cut,
bruise and digest in Tile-flower-water, two quarts: Sage-water, one quart: then
distill in Balneo Mariae, and keep the liquor to bath the convulsed parts
withal. Sulphurous Baths are said to be most efficacious. Also dry or
vaporous Baths are much commended, which are made from the boiling of Sage,
Rosemary, Staechas, Germander, Origanum, Juniper, and such like.

24. This following plaster is said to be profitable: Take Colophony, two
ounces: shippitch, Rosin, of each one ounce: Frankincense, Mastich, Ceruse, of
each half an ounce: Sanguis Draconis, Niter, Sal Armoniack, Turpentine, of each
two drams: white Vitriol, one dram and half: Mother of Pearls, six ounces: Load
stone, half an ounce: yellow Amber, one dram and half: Oils of Eggs, and of
Roses, of each two drams: mix and make an Emplaster according to Art: which
spread upon Leather, and apply upon the place affected, after several
nointings, especially with this following Liniment of Penotus: Take Oil of
Turpentine, half an ounce: Oil of Cloves, six drops: Mucilage of Briony, enough
to make a Liniment.

25. But the things which I shall commend to you upon my own experience, and
which you shall scarcely ever find fail, are these: first Waters; of which the
chief are strong Aniseed-water, strong Cinnamon Water, Juniper-water, and the
Queen of Hungaries water, as also the Aqua Anhaltina Schroderi, with which you
may bath the convulsed parts half an hour or an hour, Morning and Night, for
ten fourteen or twenty days, more or less as you see occasion, always taking
care to keep the parts well bound up and warm, after the bathing.

26. Spirits for Topical use. The chief of these are the spirit of Amber, of
Angelica, of Bawm, of Carraways, of Castoreum, of Hartshorn, of
Juniper Berries, of Lavender, of Limons, of Oranges, of Mint, of Rosemary, of
Savin, of Turpentine, of Urine, spirit of Wine simple and tartariz'd, Spiritus
Cardiacus, Analepticus, Carminativus, Extribus, Anodynus, spirit of Man skull,
spirit of Earthworms, and of Vipers; with any of which you may bath the parts
affected Morning, Noon, and Night, if you can with convenience for half an
hour, or more together, and continuing the same also for many days.

27. Tinctures for Topical use. The chief of these are Tinctures of Antimony,
of Amber, of Benjamin, of Southern-wood, of Castor, of Cinnamon, of Cloves, of
Mace, of Pepper, black, white, and long. Tinctura Aurea, Tinctura Croci
Metalorum, Tinctura Cardiaca, Tinctura Corticum, Diaphoretica cum Opio,
Hysterica Nostra, Proprietatis, Tinctura Salis Tartari, Tinctura ex tribus,
Tinctura vitae Mynsichti, with several others of like kind, with which you may
bath the Backbone, and parts affected, as above mentioned.

28. Liquors and Oils for Topical use. The chief of these are Liquor vitae
Anodynus, Guttae Vitae, Vinum Benedictum, a most admirable thing, but much more
excellent if the infusion be made in spirit of Wine; Pestilential Drops:
Chemical Oil of Aniseeds, a certain practiser of our Art, told me, was not
inferior to any thing, for that by its suavity, it cherisht and comforted the
Animal spirits: Oil of Amber, of Caraways, of Turpentine, of sweet Fennel-seed,
of Oranges and Limons, of Mans-skull, of Wormwood, of Rhodium, of Sassafras;
with all which you may gently anoint once or twice a day, and so bind up the
part warm.

29. Powers and Elixirs for Topical uses. The chief of which are, Powers and
Elixirs of Amber, of Angelica, of Aniseeds, of Ambergrise, of Bawm, of
Bay Berries, of Cloves, of Camphir, of Man's skull, of Contrayerva, of
Carraways, of Cumin-seeds, of Citron-peels, of Oranges, of Limons, of Antimony,
of Musk, of Camomil, of Feather-few, of Hartshorn, of Juniperberries, of
Lavender, of Mint, of Myrrh, of Mustard Seed, of Mastick, of Marjora^, of
Nutmegs, of Mace, of Origanum, of P^ ny-royal, of Rosemary, of Sage, of Rue, o^
Sassafras, of Savin, of Time, of Turpenti^e, of Vipers, of Wormwood, and of
Cast^ eum: Elixir of Virginian Snake-root, Elixir Alexiterium, in Suffocatione
Matricis, Elixir proprietatis Paracelsi, subtilitatis Paracelsi, Elixir
Stomachicum, Elixir vitae nost. Elixir vita magis and minus Quercetani, etc.
All which may be used by bathing the parts afflicted, as also the Vertebrae of
the Neck and Back, morning and night, for ten, fifteen, or twenty days together.

30. Out of these things now mentioned, these excel; to wit, the Powers of
Rosemary and Amber, the Powers of Musk and Ambergrise, the Elixirs of Oranges
and Limons, the spirit of Mans-skull, which have a singular power above most
other things, and which by Experience being used either inwardly or outwardly,
will certainly cure this Disease, if curable; nor have I ever found them to
fail, even by external application: particularly, the experience I have had of
the effect of the Powers of Amber alone, transcend what I can say of any other
Medicine, for by the external use thereof alone, I have cured the most
inveterate Convulsions, that ever I met with, yea where the fits, have been so
exorbitant as to return above sixteen or eighteen times in the space of twenty
four hours; and therefore commend the same to the world from so great and large
experience.

CXIV. Of Convulsions arising by consent from other parts.

1. Many ways are these Convulsions caused, according to the part or parts
affected or hurt: in the Head they may arise from a puncture of the Menings of
the Brain; in the extreme parts, from a puncture of a Nerve or Tendon: In the
Stomach from poison received, or from a wound or Ulcer in the Tunicles or Coats
of the Stomach, or from Worms: in the Womb, from faetid Vapors, or sharp
humors contained in the part: in a part bitten by a Serpent or other Venomous
beast, from the poison contaminating the Animal Spirits, by reason of which
though the Medium of the Nervous system, the Brain it self becomes also
affected by consent, or compassion rather.

2. These Convulsions are all dangerous if of any long continuance before the
application of proper Medicaments; for if once the Animal powers be overcome,
farewell Life: the further the affect is from the Head and Brain, the less is
the danger; and so much the less, as the application is immediate after the
Cause: Wounds in the Menings of the Brain are very dangerous: And though some
Authors have reported that several have escaped with Life, and perfectly
recovered, who have had the Menings of the Brain hurt, yet ten have died to one
so recovered. In a puncture of a Nerve or Tendon, in any extreme part there is
great danger, and if there is once a mortification and Sphacelous begun, there
is no way to save the life of the sick, but by cutting off the part.

3. If poison be long received, it is for the most part Mortal, because there
is commonly a speedy mortification of the Viscera: If there be speedy remedy
exhibited, there is for the most part hopes, let the poison be what it will: if
there be an Ulcer of the Stomach, and Convulsions thereupon, the Convulsions
will not cease, till the Ulcer is consolidated: Convulsions from the Womb (if
caused of faetid Vapors or humors) are commonly cured by cleansing the Womb;
but if once Ulcers be created in the part, the success of the Cure will be
doubtful. Convulsions arising from Worms in the Bowels are curable, while the
parts are whole and not gnawn asunder: but if the Worms be in great numbers,
and any of the parts eaten through, Death must come and be the Physician.

4. Convulsions arising from Cholick pains are curable by taking away the
matter causing the Cholick: but if the Disease has been of long standing, so as
that from the sharpness of the humor Ulcers are created; or the sick receives
no benefit by proper Medicines, the case then is very dangerous; and so much
the more dangerous, if it be attended with vomiting, a bloody flux, bloody
urine or spitting of blood, or frequent swooning fits and faintings away,
sickness at Heart, and such like.

5. The Indications of the cure of these kinds of Convulsions must be taken
from their Causes: if there be a hurt of the Menings of the Brain, there will
be a necessity of opening the Cranium with a Trepan, after which it is to be
cured as in wounds of the Head and Brain; mixing with the Neuroticks and
Antispasmaticks in the former section, proper Cephalicks, and such as have
respect to the Brain, as the Powers of Gentian, Nutmegs, Sage Lavender,
Rosemary, Spicknard, Ditany of Creet, etc. whether they be considered as
relating to their Internal or External use.

6. If a Convulsion arise from the puncture of a Nerve o^ Tendon, as often
times happens in letting of blood, etc. in this Case the common way has been to
cut the Nerve asunder; but by this means the sick has been oblidged to the loss
to his Limb or Part for ever: to avoid this Inconveniency, and the Corruption
of the Nerve which must otherwise unavoidably follow; you ought immediately to
apply to the place Oil of Turpentine, or Oil of Aniseeds; and lay a Pledget
dipped in the same over the Wound; by this so great Ease has been procured, as
that the Convulsion has been prevented, or suddenly taken way, and the Wound
soon after cured. Some mix with the Oil of Turpentine, or Oil of Aniseeds Oil
of Roses, or Mithridate, or Turpentine, or Natural Balsum, chiefly that of
Peru; and some Oil of Earthworms, but if any addition be made to the Chemical
Oils, the Balsam of Peru, or Opabalsamum are truly the best. In punctura Nervi
(Dixit Sennertus) si foramen sit angustius, far id dilatetur, ut medicamenta
penetrare, and sanies exstillare queat; but you ought to beware that you
increase or exasperate not the Convulsion, by increasing the Pain: The common
Balsam of Sulphur, or rather the anisated Balsam of Sulphur, are without equal
in this Case. Lastly, over the Wound, you may apply this Emplaster: Take Wax,
one ounce: Pitch, Turpentine, of each half an ounce: Euphorbium, one dram: mix
and make an Emplaster. But in delicate and soft bodies, you ought to diminish
the quantity of the Euphorbium: For it is so vehement hot and sharp that it is
not to be applied to a naked Nerve, but where the Wound is deep; for, in
punctures of the Nerves, Medicaments ought to be applied, which have a Power to
resist Corruption, to dry, and are also without sharpness. Inwardly you may
give the Powder, Spirit, Tincture, Powers, or Elixir of Castoreum, either
alone, or mixed with our Guttae Vitae.

7. If the Convulsion arises by reason of Worms, you ought to give with the
Neuroticks and Antispasmaticks (mentioned in the 113 Section) such things as
have a certain specific Quality to kill Worms. Such are Worm-seed, Aloes, and
most extreme bitte^ things, to which add, Powder of Coralline, Mercurius
dulcis, white Precipitate, white Vitriol, Salt of Vitriol, Ens-Veneris,
volatile Sal Armoniack, and Salt of Hartshorn, Hartshorn calcined; the Dose
of any of which (having made your choice) is to be regulated according to the
strength and age of the Patient to whom it is given: the which we here leave to
the Discretion of the Physician.

8. If a Convulsion arises from an Ulcer in the Stomach, all will be done in
vain, unless you apply those things which have Power to absorb the acid, and by
their softness, sweetness and agglutinative properties, have Power to cleanse
and consolidate the Ulcer: among which things are Pearl and Coral levigated,
and their Magisteries: Magistery of Oyster shells, Crabs-Claws, and Crab's-eyes
prepared, but above all things Terra sigillata has the pre-eminence; for
immediately upon the taking thereof in any convenient soft and almost insipid
Vehiculum, as Rose Water, or Syrup of Poppies, etc. the pain of the Stomach has
been abated, the Convulsions taken off, and the Ulcer consolidated to a wonder:
these things we speak by Experience. An ingenious Gentleman, a Friend told me,
That the same thing would come to pass by giving Goats Blood either warm coming
from the Beast, or otherwise in Powder to half a dram, mixed with any convenient
Vehicle: the above said Magistery of Crab's-eyes, or Terra sigillata, etc. may
be given from one scruple, to two scruples, or a dram, twice or thrice a day,
according as the Patient is in age and strength: fine Bole also is thought to
have the same Virtue.

9. If Convulsions arise from Poison received into the Stomach, a Vomit ought
immediately to be given, as an Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, or our vomitting
Lozenges; after which (the Patient having first well vomitted) you ought to
give a second Vomit made only of pure Oil olive, drinking a pint or more down
at once, for so by floating upon the Mouth of the Stomach all other recrements
not yet brought forth, and any relics of Poison if any be, will certainly be
brought away; this done, the Stomach ought to be washed with two or three
quarts of warm Water, till such time as the power of the Poison is certainly
overcome, and all the humors and juyces of the Stomach made sweet; after which
you may give Antispasmatick mix with Antidotes against Poison (lest any of it
should be difused into the Blood and Veins) which by its Sympathy to the Parts,
and Antipathy to the Poison may oppose its effects in all places: such are
Mithritade, Venice-Treacle, Electuarium ad Tabidos, our new London Treacle, our
Gutta V^tae, Bezoartick-stone, Powers and Salt of Vipers, etc. But if before
you give any M^dicine the P^yson has mortified any of the Viscera, or diffused
its self through the Veins, whereby the whole Mass of Blood is contaminated,
you may give Remedies, it is true, but you shall certainly give them in vain.

10. If a Convulsion arises from the biting of a Viper or Serpent, mad Dog,
etc. in this case you ought to apply the Head of the Viper or Serpent bruised,
or part of the Liver of the mad Dog, to the place bitten (being first washed
with Spirit of Wine) if they can be gotten: if not, you must give inwardly our
Guttae Vitae, or Venice-Treacle mixed with volatile Salt of Mans-skull or of
Hartshorn; but above all other things are the Spirit, Powers, and volatile
Salt of Vipers: and in the biting of a mad Dog, the Powder of the Liver of a
mad Dog which may be given from half a dram to a dram in any antipasmatick
Vehicle; if these things be wanting, there is no greater Medicine then our
Electuarium ad Tabidos, which may be given the quantity of a Nutmeg at a time
in a little Cinnamon Water or Spirit of Saffron; and the sick laid to sweat
thereupon, a part also of the same Electuary being laid to the place wounded,

11. If a Convulsion arises from the Cholick or Griping of the Cuts; it
proceeds either from Wind, extending the Viscera, or from corrosion and
ulceration of the parts, by reason of a malign sharp and virulent humor: if it
be caused of Wind, you must mix with all your Antispasmaticks, Carminatives or
such things as expel Wind, and open Obstructions, having in their own Nature
and Essence an Anodyn and discussive Power: of this kind are the Essence of
Bay Berries, Powers of Aniseeds and Caraways, Elixir of Juniper Berries, Oil
and Powers of Fennel-seeds; and these things more especially if they be mixed
with our Guttae Vitae or Laudanum, or with choice Mithridate or Venice-Treacle,
or other things which have also a power to ease pain, joined with a carminative
Property. If it proceeds from the power of malign, sharp, corrosive or virulent
humors, it will be necessary to give such things as may absorb the Acidity, and
overcome the Virulency; of what kind are all Alkalies whatsoever, as Salt of
Tartar, Salt of Wormwood, and indeed all other vegetable alkalious Salts, as
also volatile Salts of Hartshorn, of Amber, of Mans-skull, of Vipers, and
volatile Sal Armoniack: to these you may add the Magisteries and levigated
Pouders of Crab's-eyes and Claws, Chalk, Terra Lemnia, Terra Sigillata, both the
redish and white, as also fine Bole, Coral, Pearl, Oyster-shells, and other
things of like Nature. See 8 above.

12. If a Convulsion arises from Obstructions or Filthiness of the Womb, you
must take care to open those Obstructions, by exhibiting such things with
Neuroticks and Antispasmaticks as may have a Power to operate upon the Womb; of
this kind are fine Aloes, washed Aloes, and all sorts of Pills made of Aloes,
as Aloephanginae, Cochiae minoris, Pil. Rudii, Pil. Ruffi, etc. after the Body
is well cleansed by Aloeticks, which have the greatest force of any thing in
this case; you ought to have such things as potentially move the Courses
without any thing of a purging force, such are Powers of Savin, Saffron, Borax,
both natural and artificial; and indeed all volatile Salts whatsoever: these
things you may mix with such things as either cleanse the Womb, as the Essence
and Syrup of stinking Arach; or with such things as comfort, fortitify, and
strengthen the Womb, of what kind are the Essences and Syrups of Garden-Tansey,
Fetherfew, Myrrh, Powers of Rosemary, Sage, Lavender, and most other
Cephallicks, which by a secret power operate upon those Parts, and of what kind
are all Hystericks; for which I referr you to their proper places.

CHAP. VII. Of A CONTRACTION.
The AUTHORS Observations.
I. The Contraction of the right Arm in a Child.

1. A Little Youth about seven years of Age, having been for some time
afflicted with Convulsion-fits, by the long continuance of them, and the more
especial spasm of the right Arm, the Sinews thereof became contracted; so that
the Child could not stretch out his Arm, nor make any use thereof, although the
Convulsions had for a good time left him, having been cured of them by former
Remedies.

2. The Child being beautiful, and this contraction of his Arm a great blemish,
as well as a prejudice to the use of the Arm: moved his Parents to seek out
still for further Remedy; and falling into my hands, I applied the following
things.

3. First, a little to open the pores of the skin, thereby to make a more easy
Passage for other Medicaments, I caused the Part affected to be bathed three or
four times with the Spirit of Wine, then I caused it to be anointed with
Neats-foot Oil, afterward I applied this following Cataplasm.

4. Take the pulp of Turnips baked in their skinns, Neats-foot Oil, one ounce:
mix them all together into a Cataplasm, and apply it, renewing it every Morning
and Evening, together with the anointing and bathing of the spirits of Wine, as
abovesaid.

5. This was done for 5 or 6 weeks together or thereabouts without any neglect;
in which space of time the Child's Arm seemed to be perfectly restored and the
Contracture wholly resolved.

6. However a great weakness remained, so that its Arm seemed useless, but by
Reason the Child was growing, we had great hopes that nature would contribute
something as to adding strength to it.

7. Now to effect that intention, We applied that most admirable Emplaster of
Mynsicht, viz. his Diagalbano Crocatum, a Medicament never sufficiently to be
commended; by the application whereof our feeble Patient, in two or three
months time was perfectly restored, to my great Credit, and the exceeding
satisfaction of his indulgent Parents.

II. A Contracture of the Arm in an old Water-man in Southwark.

1. This old Man aged about seventy, for the space of seven or eight year had
lost the use of his left Arm, by reason of a Contracture, so that he could not
in any wise attend his Calling; the poor old Man desired my help, which I
granted and performed the Cure, as follows.

2. First, I bathed the Contracture, very well with the Spirit of Aniseeds,
then I caused it to be anointed with Oleum Nervinum, after which I applied,
Emplastrum de minio simplex, made with Vinegar and Oil, without Wax, it was
boiled and taken off whilst it was red, a little before it was going to turn
black.

3. In this, Cloths was dipped and applied to his Arm, and about six or seven of
these plasters or Sear-cloths performed the Cure.

4. The poor old Man was able to give me nothing for my Cure, but only gave me
of his own free will a bottle of Sack: However not long after, as a further
token of his gra^^ful spirit, he helped me to a better Patient, from whom I
Received about fifteen or sixteen pound.

III. A Contraction in the left Ham in a certain Virgin.

1. It was occasioned through a fall, and a hurt in the part or parts adjacent,
being ill cured; the Contracture was new, but by reason the joint was great as
also the parts contracted, I was the more dubious of the Cure; however being
encouraged by the Friends of the party affected.

2. I applied the following things with success, beyond Imagination: first, I
caused the part affected to be very well bathed with the Spirit of Aniseeds,
then I anointed it very well with the expressed Oil of Mace, after which we
applied for forty days together or more the Cataplasmum de stercore humano, the
praeparation of which you may see in our Doron lib. 3. cap. 7. sect. 9.

3. The Cure succeeded much contrary to my expectation, For the Patient could
walk without Crutches or so much as halting.

4. The like Cure I performed in a Child, using only the same Medicaments.

IV. A Contracture in the Ham with a lameness of both the Ankles.

1. This being a Youth about fifteen or fixteen years of age, had this
disaffection upon him by reason of a fall; first, I bathed all the weakened and
disaffected parts with the Spirit of Aniseeds, afterward with the Powers of
Amber.

2. Immediately after I anointed with Oil of Mace by expression, after which I
applied Emplastrum diasulphuris Rulandi, by which my Patient seemed to be
cured, save only a weakness remained upon the parts lately disaffected.

3. After the application of the Emplaster about eight or nine weeks, it being
renewed once in three days, I caused the said weakened parts to be bathed with a
strong tincture of Myrrh, made with the best rectifyed spirit of Wine, whereby
the sick in a short time became perfectly well.

V. A Contraction Incurable.

1. A young Man about seventeen or eighteen years of age, was taken with the
Sciatica, by which he was vehemently afflicted; this Disease, either by nature
or the Artifice of Empericks, degenerated; and the matter was translated into
an Apostem on the outside of the Thigh, which being opened a great quantity of
corruption came out.

2. But by the ill-management of the cure or unskillfulness of the Chyrurgion,
the Apostem fistulated and made Coney-borroughs as it were thorugh the whole
Thigh; which afterward by another hand was Cut up and the bone laid open to be
scaled, being black and corrupted in many places.

3. After two years time the Patient was in a sort cured, leaving only a great
Contraction of the Ham and one running Fistula-sore, which was no great trouble
to him, yet this evil Effect it had, that thereby the whole Humidum Radicale
was drained away; the sick dying in a miserable Consumption.

4. In his Lifetime almost a thousand things were applied to restore the
contracted Hand but all in vain.

5. Being dead, I was desirous to see the contracted Tendon, which being laid
open and freed from the rest of the flesh and Vessels, it had contracted not a
Gristley but a kind of Boney hardness, to the great Admiration of the
Spectators; this hardness by degrees decreased, till it left the Nerve in its
own natural state.

VI. A Contraction of the Fingers cured by a Woman Emperick.

1. She first anointed the contracted parts with the Oil of Cammomil, which
being don for two or three days, she caused the Patient to hold her Hands in a
hot Cows-Paunch for an hour or two; which was five or six several times
repeated.

2. In the Intervalls of which and afterward she only applied this following
Cataplasm: Take Oleum Nervinum, one ounce: Oil of Cammomil; Oil of Euphorbium,
of each half an ounce: fresh Cow Dung, half a pound: mix them well together and
apply them to the part affected.

3. By the use of these means, the Patient was in about five or six weeks
restored again to perfect health.

VII. A Contraction of the In-step with a scrophulous Tumor.

1. This was supposed at first to come through a strain, but whatever the
cause, there was a great flux of ill-digested humors to the part afflicted,
whereby followed a Contraction of the In-step; with a great Tumor thereof and
in the Ankle; and indeed a swelling of the whole Foot; Insomuch that the
Patient a Youth about ten or eleven years of age, could not go, and was forced
to keep his bed for many weeks together.

2. Many things were used to resolve the Tumor, and great Discussives were
applied, but all in vain, at length we applied things to ripen it and to bring
it to a Suppuration, which in convenient time was done.

3. The Tumor ran at first a great deal of thin matter, afterward the Sanies
run more thick; being broke, we applied this following Cataplasm.

4, Take Venice Turpentine, two ounces: Oil of Roses, one ounce: Yolks of Eggs,
number two: with Bean-Meal a sufficient quantity, make a Cataplasm, which apply.

5. The Tumor seemed cavernous or hollow, whereupon we cast thereinto with a
Syringe this following Injection: Take plantain-Water, a pint: Salt of Vitriol,
two drams: Saccharum Saturni, half a dram: Tincture of Aloes made of white
Wine, one ounce and half: Infusion of Crocus mutallorum, Spirit of Wine, of
each two ounces: mix and make an Injection to be cast in warm twice a day.

6. The Tumor, Lameness, and Sore continued more than a year upon him: Insomuch
that the Friends of the Person were advised by several Chyrurgions to have it
laid open.

7. But by reason of the place or situation of the malady and the great number
of the Vessels with which those Parts are stored, as Veins, Arteries,
Nerves-Limphaticks together with Ligaments, and Tendons, I told them my
opinion, That it could not be safely done, but with apparent dangers, and that
unless he had a very skillful Chyrurgion indeed, and if such, yet he could
assure them nothing, he might endanger the cutting of some of the principal
Vessels, whereby he should be made certainly lame without any hope of Recovery;
whereas now whilst there was nothing hur^ they might live in hopes of a perfect
Cure.

8. By my persuasions they desisted from the Chyrurgeons advice, with a
resolution only of following my Counsel. Hereupon because it was in a depending
part, I ordered the sick to keep his bed for ten or twelve weeks or more,
applying the foresaid things, casting in the aforesaid Injection and putting
into the Cavitie, tents dipped in Vnguentum Nicotianae, swathing also up the
parts above the Ankle.

9. In the mean season we instituted this following Diet, with which he was
purged for twenty or thirty days or more together.

10. Take new Ale, three gallons: choice Sena, eight ounces: Juniper Berries
well bruised, four ounces: Caraway-seeds, Ginger, Coriander-seeds, of each one
ounce, all well bruised: Sal Prunellae bruised, one ounce and half: Sassafras
rasped, round Birthwort roots, of each three ounces: put all into a Bagg with a
stone in it, and let them work up with Ale, of which when the working was over
the Patient drank every day half a pint more or less as he found it to operate,
by which he became very well cleansed, and the morbifick matter of the Scrofula
was thoroughly carried off.

11. This quantity of Diet was four times repeated, and although the Disease
was rebellious and long, yet by the use and application of the abovenamed
things in about a years space the Cure was completely performed.

12. However by reason of the long disaffection of the part, the whole Tumor
did not vanish, and such weakness was contracted that he could not go for many
Months without Crutches.

13. For the more perfect Resolution of the Tumor and Strengthening of the
weakened parts and also to prevent a new Generation of the morbifick matter, I
ordered first a Repetion once more of the former Diet; secondly, the
application of the following Emplaster: Take Honey, two ounces: Mithridate,
four ounces: Aloes in fine Powder, one ounce and half: red Myrrh, three ounces:
being in Powder and dissolved or made soft with rectified Spirit of Wine, mix
them well together and spread them on Leather, and apply them, letting it lie
for a week or more as you shall see Occasion.

14. By the use of these last things in a short time, he could not only go
without Crutches, but stoutly walk many miles in a day. A like Cure not much
differing from this, I performed in a young Maiden, of about fourteen years of
age, and almost in all respects with the same things.

VIII. A Contraction in both Hands and Arms.

1. A young Man about thirty years of age, having taken a very great Cold, had
universal Pains seized him running over his whole Body from Head to Foot, at
last they took up their station in his Hands and Arms, with which he was
vehemently afflicted night and day for a long time together.

2. He had been under the hands of very many, as well learned Physicians as
Empericks, But all their applications proved unsucessful: at length I was sent
for, and I found, that by unskilful practice, the Patient had been miserably
abused, and that there was a great Contraction in both Hands and both Arms.

3, The Cure seemed difficult, so that I was loath to attempt any thing therein:
However by persuasion I was wrought upon to make trial what could be done; In
the first place I gave him a Dose of our Royal Powder, the praeparation of
which you may see in our Doron, in its proper place; this was repeated four
times. Afterward I sweat him with this following: Take Venice Treacle,
Electuarium de Ovo, of each half a dram, Bezoar Mineral, sixteen grains: mix
them and let the Patient swallow it.

4. Immediately after which I gave this: Take Spirit of Angelica, the Greater
Composition, Treacle-Water, of each half an ounce: Syrup of
Clove-gelly-flowers, one ounce: Oil of Cinnamon, one drop: mix them.

5. Outwardly I bathed all the afflicted parts with the Spirit of Aniseeds for
two or three days; Afterward with this following Compositum. Take Powers of
Aniseeds, Oxs-Gall, of each a pint, mix them together, and let the Patient bath
therewith Morning and Night, this was done for a month or five weeks, at the
end of which time our Patient seemed to be perfectly restored; but the sweating
means was three times repeated after the same.

IX. Another Contraction in the Arm.

1. This person by means of a fall had both a numness and Contraction so that
the part seemed to be almost dead.

2. I caused the part to be bathed three times a day with the Powers of
Aniseeds for about twelve days, afterward with the Powers of Amber for five
days, which was done with great frictions or rubbing.

3. Then this Cataplasm was applied: Take Pulp of Turnips, baked with their
skin on, half a pound: Oil of Juniper Berries, one ounce: Orobus-meal, enough
to make it of the thickness of a Pultise, mix them, and apply it warm twice a
day, which was done for nine or ten days, at what time the parts seemed to be
in a manner restored.

4. Afterward we applied Mynsicht his Emplastrum de Galbano Crocatum; which
was renewed every third or fourth day, and the Patient was about two months
time made perfectly well; being freed both from the Contraction and numedness.

5. We cured also a little Girl, much in like manner afflicted, having a
Contraction in her Ham and Thigh, occasioned by a vehement burning Fever,
which came through taking cold, the Medicines were the same in all respects.

6. We also with the same Medicines cured a Baker, who had a Contracture in his
Arm, but lately made through a Blow, and ill application of Medicaments by an
unskilful Chyrurgion.

X. A Contracture of one Thigh with a Fistula in the other.

1. A Man about forty eight years of age, who by a fall hurting of his Hipp;
after some few days the Pain fell from his Hips into his Thighs near the Ham:
wherein, upon one, there was a Contraction, on the other, an Apostem; which
afterward degenerated into a Fistula.

2. The Man for a long time had used much means, and taken the Advice of many
Physicians, but all in vain; sometimes he thought himself better, and sometimes
worse.

3. However the Apostem was healed up too soon before it was thoroughly cleansed
and fit for consolidation, whereupon the icorus matter made new furrows, and
caused the breaking out of a sore about four Inches below the former Apostem.

4. This, for want of skillful looking after, degenerated into a Fistula, with
a very hard Callous, the Cavity was so deep that a tent of four or five Inches
long might go into it, when I came to view it, I presently saw it was a
Fistula, and an unskilful Artist had it in hand.

5. I caused one Roger Dickson a Chyrurgion of my acquaintance to be sent for,
who laid open the sore and took off the Callous by application of unguentum
Egytiacum, which was very well and accurately performed.

6. In the mean season, I caused the Patient to drink this following
Diet-drink: Take Sage, Betony, Ale-hoof, Self-heal, Bugloss, Bawm, Avens,
Agrimony, water-Agrimony, Scordium, Germander, Clownes-Woundwort, of each one
handful: Juniper Berries well bruised, six ounces: boil all in a sufficient
quantity of spring water, toward the end of the boiling add sal Prunellae, two
ounces: boil to the consumption of the third part of the water, then strain;
and to every quart of the strained liquor being settled add spirit of Wine two
ounces: double refined Sugar, three ounces: let it be bottled up, and so keep
it for use; one bottle of which the Patient drank every day.

7. However during the time of the taking of this Diet every fourth day, I
purged the Patient with my Pill. Panchimagogae, which infallibly conquered the
morbifick matter, the Composition, preparation, virtues use and dose of them
you may see in my Doron, lib. 2. cap. 23. sect. 1.

8. With the diet, I caused also the Fistula to be washed and cleansing it with
Vngnentum Nicotianae: Afterward I caused it to be washed with my Regulata or
Magisteral water, the which you may see in our said Doron, lib. 3. cap. 1.
sect. 18.

9. By taking the things above named inwardly, and by application of the other
things outwardly, with the use of Incarnatives, the Fistula was disposed to
healing, and in about ten weeks time was made perfectly well.

10. However all this while we were not unmindful of the contracture on the
other Thigh; but we after bathing the part with the Spirit of Wine, applied
thereto emollient Cataplasms, such as the following.

11. Take Pulp of Turnips baked with their skins on, pulp of Onions baked with
their skins on, of each half a pound: fat Figgs, four ounces: Oil of Anniseeds,
six drams: mix them well together, and with Crumbs of white Bread and
Orobus-meal, a sufficient quantity, beat them into a Pultise.

12. This was applied for a Month, afterward we added to every half pound of
the Pultise one ounce of Ox-Galls, which was applied five or six weeks, as
before, at the end of which time our Patient seemed to be well, save there was
left behind a weakness of the Part, which we restored by this following
Emplaster.

13. Take Aloes in fine Powder, two ounces: Mithridate, Myrrh in fine Powder,
of each three ounces: Lodestone in fine Powder, an ounce and half: mix the
Aloes with the Mithridate, dissolve the Myrrh with the rectified Spirit of
Wine, which make soft with a little Honey, then mix all together, adding thereto
the Powder of Loadstone and make an entire Mass, which spread upon Leather and
apply to the Part affected, all these things were done in a little more than a
quarter of a year, and this deplored Patient was made perfectly well.

XI. A Contracture in the Arm of three years standing.

1. The Person was about three and thirty years of age, the Contracture was
about three years standing, it was performed by a Chyrurgion; by an application
of Emollients, and a steel Instrument screwed upon the Part.

2. He first of all by my directions bathed it with the Spirit of Aniseeds,
then anointed it with the Oil of Earthworms, afterward he applied this
following emollient Pultise for ten days: Take Yolks of Eggs, number four: Oil
of Roses, Oil of Earthworms, of each two ounces: Pulp of Cabbage, eight
ounces: Pulp of roasted Turnips, six ounces, fat Figgs, four ounces: mix and
beat all together and make a Cataplasm, which let it be applied upon Leather,
Morning and Night for twelve days, as aforesaid.

3. At the end of twelve days he applied an emollient Emplaster, upon which he
fixed a steel Compress with Screws, which being turned, straightned the Part,
so that every day turning the Screws, by little and little reduced the Part to
its true Situation.

4. By the same means with the steel Compress, another Person who had a
Contracture in the Hand, was cured in about sixty days time.

XII. A Contracture proceeding from Epileptick-Fits.

1. A young Maid being long troubled with an Epilepsy with convulsive Motions,
had after the Epilepsy left her a Contracture upon several parts of the right
Side, the first occasion was supposed to proceed from the vehemence of the
Convulsions.

2. These Contractions afflicted in a manner her whole left Side, from which
she was freed by the following Remedies.

3. Inwardly because she had been formerly afflicted with the Epilepsy; I
caused these following things to be given: Take choice Musk, twelve grains:
Ambergrise, five grains: Civet, one grain: Venice-Treacle, one scruple: mix and
make a Bolus to strengthen the Nerves.

4. Outwardly I caused her to be bathed all over that Side with the Powers of
Aniseeds which was done for five days.

5. Afterward I caused her to be anointed all over that Side with the Oil of
Earthworms, especially where the chief Contractions were, then I caused to be
bound about her Arm, Thigh and Leg, a new Lambs-skin or Sheeps-skin, whilst it
was hot and new come off the Lamb or Sheep; by the application of which alone
thing I cured these Contractions in this Patient which were thought beyond
Belief.

6. For a Lambs-skin or Sheeps-skin whilst newly flead off has the Power to
mollify, soften, discuss, and mightily strengthen the Part afflicted, the which
thing for its admirable Excellency in this kind I could not but mention and
declare to the World.

7. It is also an excellent thing against all manner of Gouts, other Pains,
Lamnesses and Weaknesses of the Joints; And I knew a certain Man vehemently
afflicted with the Gout, who was perfectly cured thereof by the application of
fresh Sheeps-skins newly flayed off, to the Part affected.

XIII. A Contraction with a Convulsion.

1. Though all Convulsions are Contractions, yet all Contractions are not
Convulsions, but this was a Contraction with a Convulsion, the Contraction
remaining when the Fit was off.

2. And being first created by the vehemence of the convulsive Motions, such a
firm Contraction was made, that the animal Spirits could not have their
recourse as before, whereupon for want of a Flux of Spirits, a Contraction or
Hardness was generated, this Person thus afflicted was cured by the following
things:

3. Take Aqua Epileptica Langii, four ounces: Aqua Cerasorum nigrorum, three
ounces: Spirit of Angelica the greater Composition, two ounces: Magistral Water
of Earthworms and of Snails, of each one ounce: mix them together, and dulcify
them with Syrup of Clove-gilly-Flowers, of which there was taken three
spoonfuls every Morning fasting, and every Night going to bed.

4. And the Parts afflicted were bathed very well Morning and Evening with
Powers of Amber and Aniseeds mixed together in an equal Proportion, by the use
of which means the convulsive Motions totally vanished; yet so as that they
left a Contracture behind.

5. This Contracture being new, was cured without any great matter of
difficulty by anointing the place affected with this following Composition:
Take Oil of Earthworms, Oleum Nervinum, of each three ounces: Oil of Mace by
Expression, two ounces: Oil of Juniper Berries, half an ounce: mix them
together to anoint with, as aforesaid, by the use of this alone Medicament; the
contracted Part was cured in about sixteen days time.

XIV. A Contraction occasioned by the Gout.

1. A certain man about forty years of age, having been long afflicted with the
Gout, by reason of the extreme Pain fell into Convulsion fits, from whence of a
sudden a great and admirable Contraction was excited, the Sinews were drawn
together, and so remained about the bigness of a large Hens Egg, to which many
things were applied, but all in vain.

2. The Physicians gave him many purges, vomits, exhibited sudorifick doses,
outwardly there was applied emollients, Baths, Fomentati^ns, Frictions, but all
in vain.

3. Last of all the Patient came to me, and made a relation of his condition,
which when I had considered that the cause of the Contracture was from
repletion of the musculous part, with an abolition and frustration of the
Spirits in the same, I judged that some new course must be taken.

4. Whereupon I forthwith applied a vesicatory, which drew not a flux of humors
there, as some vainly fear or suggest, but by drawing water did thereby indeed
excite the natural heat; by which the obstructive matter became dissipated and
thereby also the humors came to be influxed, from whence I had very great hopes
of a resolution, and that not without cause.

5. For that the Tumor was mightily diminished, even upon the drawing of the
Blister, the Blister being drawn, I caused it to be emptied, afterward I
applied Mynsichts Emplastrum de Galbano Crocatum, which has a mighty power to
resolve or discuss humors, of which kind are all such things as warm and
comfort the Nerves.

6. After this had lain on ten or twelve days, being renewed every other day, I
applied the following Compositum to the part affected, with such success as
that it answered the end desired: Take Myrrh in powder, three ounces: make a
kind of dissolution in the best rectified spirit of Wine, to which add Venice
Treacle, two ounce and half: Aloes in fine powder, one ounce and half: Oil of
Mace by expression, one ounce: Oil of Rosemary, two drams: mix them well
together, and apply it being spread upon Leather.

Observations from other Authors.
XV. A Contraction of the Fingers and Palsy of the Hands.

1: A noble Man well in years, after a long Cholick and resolution, and a
Contraction that followed; had his Fingers on both hands contracted, the two
knuckles were so bound down, that his Fingers lay in the Palms of his Hands,
and could by no force be extended, but what he laid hold with them, he held
fast: his Hands hung a little down, and were loose, so that without help he
could not lift them up, and his Thumb and Forefinger were out of joint and
loose.

2. Many remedies and Baths were used to no purpose; For the infirmity
continued for two years, at length being willing to undergo extremities in so
desperate an evil, he went to the Pepper Baths, taking first my advice, because
he knew I was succesful in many things I attempted.

3. About the end of April the cure was thus begun; he was first purged well
with a Wine, which was good for the Nerves, for the space of three days; then
he tried a Topic upon his right Hand; to wit, a plaster to the inward part of
the Hand, and between the Fingers, with which he had a very good Ligature, to
press the Fingers outwardly with a splinter and a rowler which continued some
time at Night.

4. In the Morning they were taken off and had to every Finger a weight of Lead
tied to a string, to stretch them by degrees, The Plaster was thus made: Take
Gum Ammoniack, two ounces: Galbanum, opopanax, Bdellium, of each one ounce:
dissolve them in Aqua vitae; add Storax Calamitae, half an ounce: Goose-grease,
and the marrow of a Dears shank, of each one ounce: Frankincense, two drams:
Orris, a dram: Hermodacts, a dram: with Turpentine and Rosin a pint, make a
Plaster.

5. He used in the Morning a fume of these Troches upon Embers, with a case for
his Head to receive it; thus, Take marcasites, an ounce and half: Myrrh,
Mastich, of each two drams: Storax, Benjamin, of each a dram: Orris, half a
dram: with Turpentine make Troches; these were used eight days, and he could by
pressing them stretch forth his Fingers, he used the Plaster three nights to
his left Hand, and he found those Fingers also to yield.

6. They wrote to me of it; and to strengthen the Joints, I advised him to bath
his Hand twice or thrice in a decoction of Sage, made of Lie, that had Steel
quenched in it; and continue his other course.

7. When his Fingers could be almost all extended especially in his right Hand,
but not by the proper strength of the Muscles; he came to me, I advised the use
of the Plaster to be continued, not only on the inside of his Hand but
outwardly at Night, because his Knucles were hard; and that he should use the
same twice a week, not too hot, for then he observed that his Fingers were
bound.

8. And that he should anoint before the applying of the Plaster both hands
within and without with this Ointment: Take Oil of Lillies and Earthworms, of
each two ounces and half: Oleum Cheyrinum, and Orris, of each half an ounce:
Litharge, one ounce: boil them a little, add Ammoniacum dissolved in Aqua
vitae, an ounce: Storax, two drams: Turpentine, half an ounce: with Wax make an
Ointment.

9. In the Morning the Plasters were taken off, and this fomentation used: Take
roots of Althaea, Briony, Orris, Lillies, all green and sliced, of each a good
quantity, Wormwood, Time, Sage, of each an handful: Cammomil, Melilot and Elder
flowers, of each one pugil: Line-seed and Faenugreek, of each three or four
spoonfulls: boil them in Broth made of Calves-feet and head, and a little Wine:
let him wash his Hands in it hot a good while every Morning.

10. Though all things mended, and he doubted not of Cure, yet because the time
was come, he went a long Journey with large expense to a Bath; by the use
whereof his Fingers seemed rather to be bound than loosened.

11. And returning by Boat, over Tyber, he was taken with a Megrim, with
vomiting at first, so that he could neither stand nor sit, but was brought home
upon a Couch, his Hands from hence became again Paralytick; and despairing of
Cure, because he had neglected to follow my counsel, he was ashamed to require
it again. Platerus, lib. 1. page 147.

XVI. A Contraction of the right Leg after a Sciatica.

1 A noble Person had his right Leg contracted, drawn up and awry toward the
inside: so that standing upright, he could not move his Foot to the ground,
unless he bent his Body, nor could he go without a Patten. Moreover his Leg was
longer and wanted Nourishment.

2. The hurt of the Function, for no other Motion is hindered but that whereby
the Thigh moves up and down, shows that the cause of the Evil is in the
Hip-Joint, also the inequality, swelling, and streching in the right side of
the Joint, to be seen and felt, and the lower part of the Backbone, and the Os
Sacrum seeming awry also show the same, especially the Sciatica having gone
before this Disease and continued long, so much of the Part affected.

3. The Disease that is in the said Part is the Luxation of the Joint, the head
of the Thigh Bone getting out of the socket, and falling down to the Process of
the Os Pubis, and there stopping: the two Ligaments which bind this Joint being
chiefly hurt.

4. For in regard the Ligament that goes about the Joint is the largest of that
sort in the whole Body, it may yield, so that the head of the Thigh Bone may
get out of its place and stay upon the Ligament, which being the thickest in
the whole Body, cannot be broken, and the other thick and round Ligament that
uses to keep the head-bone in the hollow, being enlarged and vehemently
attracted.

5. This may be hard, by too much stretching, as a strong Cord, which cannot be
broken, or by any violence drawn out of the socket, to the gristle, whereunto
it grows and keeps the Thigh hanging down, and hinders its Motion, because it
is not loose, as when it was in the socket, but is very much stretched by the
descent. This I suppose to be the cause of this stiff Leg.

6. For here is no Induration of Nerves, from whence Numness, Contraction,
Resolution or Palsy would rather follow, nor Impediment of the Joint, for the
constitution of which Bones and Ligaments are required and not Nerves; nor the
Tendons of the Muscles that move the Thigh, the cause; as it appears by this,
because the Thigh can move; and the Impediment is only that it hangs so that it
cannot touch the ground, and so hinders sitting and standing.

7. Now this Luxation from whence this stretching comes, had its cause from a
Defluxion, which formerly produced the Sciatica, which went before this
Disease. As for Prognostics, it is almost impossible in my Judgment, that this
Joint should be reduced and the Luxation cured; Therefore there is nothing to
be done by Force least the Disease should be worse, because these stiff Parts,
when the Bones are thus twisted, can by no Art be rightly placed again.

8. Therefore we must labor only, that the Thigh should by degrees fall so low,
that the Foot may touch the ground, and so he may walk a little again and stand.

9. And although be use not all Motions, yet he may lift it up and have it in a
form more proper to serve him than now it is.

10. That the Thigh may be brought down, Art and Industry must be used with
Medicines, and the Patient and Physician also must be patient to expect the
time, for I have often been successful in the cure of a crooked Thigh, and
Joints of the Knee.

11. After general Medicines to cleanse the Body and fit it for Topics; I used
things first to soften the hardened Ligaments and to draw down the Leg by
degrees; it is very hard to soften these Ligaments that lie so low, especially
this round one, which is the cause of the Disease, for Medicines can scarce
reach thither.

12. Moreover this strong Ligament is so stretched, that it can hardly be
stretched further, which must be done, if we will have the Leg descend. And if
Force be used, it will be painful. But because the constant use of good and
strong Medicines may pierce inward, and loosen the Ligaments though very hard,
by continual following of them, I doubt not but in time all things being
rightly ordered, to do the thing by Gods Blessing.

13. First he had a broad plate of Lead sowed in his Breeches on that Side, and
I advised h m when he sat, that he would press down his Foot therewith, while
he could endure it.

14. This at first was troublesome, but after it was easy, and the weight was
increased, and another hung to the Leg with a broad Rowler near the Knee. A
weight to the Foot, Heel or Leg could do little good, because the Knee was
loose between, but it is better to the Thigh, than to any Part beneath.

15. I advised a Ligature to the Thigh, and to be fastened to the ground, and
that he should strain and pull it out, that his Foot might but reach the
ground, which is our desire.

16. That the Ligament might yield better, he had mollifying Plasters, as of
Briony; Henbane, Orrice, Sulphur, with piercing things to help the Operation;
Experience has taught me the use of Baths of Sulphur; and their use seems very
rational, because Sulphur is the Fat of the Earth, and soonest burns, and is
most softning.

17. I advised the Bath to be used (such as are those at Baden in Helvetia,
which are very profitable to the sick, as Experience has taught me;) and other
ingenious ways to stretch the Thigh. Platerus, Lib. 1. Page 151.

XVII. The Contraction of the left Leg to the Buttocks, with a hard tumor
about the Knee, and want of nourishment in the Leg.

1. A Youth had his left Knee swellen, both before and in the Ham; it was an
insensible hard Tumor about the whole joint, but with Pain, where the Nerve was
pressed: all his Leg above and below the Knees wanted nourishment, the swelled
joint did not apparently move, his Foot was so high that his Heel almost
touched his Buttock.

2. I suppose that this Tumor was inwardly in the Tendons and Ligaments about
the joint, from thick and excrementitious nourishment which came from the
weakness of the part and a defluxion, he used many Medicines at Paris, such as
sweats and Diets, evacuations and Topics of all sorts, yet I began thus.

3. I cleansed his body often, in this manner: Take Spearidock roots, two
ounces: Fumitory, Mercury, tops of Hops, of each an handful: Aniseeds, two
drams: Raisons, two ounces: Sebestins six, Tamarinds, pulped an ounce:
Polypody, two ounces: Senna, two ounces and half: Cordial flowers, a pugil:
Epithymum, half an ounce: boil them according to art, add syrup of Roses,
Solutive and of Fumitory, of each one ounce and half: Cinnamon, two drams: give
an ounce or more now and then; he took Conserve of ground-pin, and Roses
sometimes, and sweated once a week in a Bath.

4. He held his Leg an hour in the Morning fasting, for some weeks in this
decoction, which was renewed every third day: Take Briony-roots, half a pound:
Lilly and Marsh-mallows-roots, of each three ounces: Mallows-roots and all,
Violets, Wormwood, Ground pine, of each an handful: Cammomil, Melilot,
Elder-flowers, of each two pugils: Line-seed, an ounce: wild Cucumber-roots, an
ounce: Orrice-roots, an ounce:

5. He applied this Plaster, to his Knee: Take gum Ammoniack, Bdellium, of each
an ounce: Opopanax, Galbanum, Frankincense, liquid, Storax, of each half an
ounce: Veal or Ox-Marrow, an ounce: Orrice-roots, an ounce: Bay Berries, half
an ounce: Volubilis, an ounce (I suppose it to be Mercury) with Turpentine and
Wax, make a Plaster or Cerot.

6. He anointed with this Ointment: Take Oil of Earthworms, Foxes, Camomil, of
each an ounce: Oil of Pepper, Lillies, Bears-grease, of each half an ounce:
with Wax make a Liniment, add Oil of Spike, three drams.

7. I repeated the Plaster and added Volubilis, two ounces: Mucilage of
Lineseed, and Marshmallows, of each one ounce: Gum Elemi, half an ounce: and
fomented with this: Take roots of Marshmallows, two ounces: green Briony, a
pound: Lillies, four ounces: Mallows, Violet-leaves, of each two handfuls:
Wormwood, Sage, Ground-pin, of each an handful: Eaenugreek and Line-seed, of
each one ounce and half: Orrise roots, an ounce: Bay Berries, half an ounce:
boil them in Wine and Water, and foment in the strained Liquor, three measures.

8. Of the residue make a Cataplasm thus; Beat and sift it, and add Oil of
Lillies, four ounces: Hens and Goose-grease, of each an ounce and half: Gum
Amoniack, dissolved in Aqua vitae, an ounce: tops of Time, dried Orris-roots,
of each a dram: make a Cataplasm.

9. Use this fume to his Leg: Take Marcasites, three drams: Storax Calamitae,
two drams: Orris roots, half a dram: with Vinegar and Turpentine, make Troches
weighing a dram: by these means and an Instrument to draw his Foot down applied
to the Knee, he was restored, but he went on his tip-toes, and could walk where
he pleased. Platerus, lib. 1. page 157.

XVIII. A Contraction of the Arm about the Elbow, with want of nourishment,
from a Nerve hurt in Blood-letting.

1. A Stone-cutter opening the inward Vein of the Arm in an old Woman, Pain
followed in the same place, which reached from the Elbow to the ends of the
Fingers, with numness and pricking, called Formication; returning home the Pain
increased, and she sent for the Stone-cutter to help her, but he sent his
Servant, who only applied Bacon to the Wound, which was swelled; and when by
that, neither Pain nor Tumor abated, and the Stone-cutter neglected and would
apply nothing else.

2. She asked counsel of the Hangman, his Medicines prevailed not, and her Arm
began to fall away, and to be in a Convulsion: therefore the Hangman anointed
her Arm, with hot attracting ointments to cure the Atrophy and bring
nourishment, but all was in vain.

3. The evil grew worse, and in the wounded place was an Ulcer that was foul,
and the parts there were corrupted. She sent for a City Chyrurgion, he held her
some months cleansing the Ulcer, and used Balsams, Ointments and the like, to
her decayed Arm; and at length he cured the Ulcer, which was very broad and
deep, and had corrupted the Nerves, Veins, Arteries and heads of the Muscles,
some pieces whereof he took forth.

4. But he left her Arm extenuated, stiff and attracted about the joints of the
Elbow and Figure, and not fit for motion, and in the bending of the Arm was a
Tumor like a thick cord from the end of the Shoulder to the Arm-pit, binding it
up with a numness without Pain and without use.

5. When she knew it was done by the caerlessness of the Stone-cutter, she sued
him at Law for damages and expenses; the Judge hearing diverse testimonies of
Chirurgions, at length called for Testimonies of Physicians; which I gave thus.

6. Whatsoever Errors are committed in Blood-letting, is thought by the vulgar
to come from oppening of the Vein above and beneath, if this happen as it often
does, then because the Blood runeth not only through the external Orifice in
the skin, but also through the other that is beneath, it sweats through the
flesh thereby, and the part about the wound is a little swollen, and then grows
blew and yellow as in a bruise, and it goes away of it self; except by a great
flux of Blood, any inflammation follow; and if it be not discussed it turns to
suppuration and an Ulcer, which sometimes brings greater acccidents.

7. But a greater evil may happen by Blood-letting, as great Pain of the part
opened or the parts near, with Inflammation, perverse Ulcer, Corruption and
Gangreen, and sometimes Impotent motion and Contraction of the whole member, or
stiffness or numbness, and sometimes Convulsions follow; when any great Nerve
under the Veins is pricked.

8. This is from the unskilfulness of the Chyrurgion; when either he cannot
distinguish between a Vein and a Nerve, or pricks it in that place, where the
Nerve lies under the Vein, as it is in many places, or when he strikes in his
Lancet two rashly and cuts the Vein and Nerve beneath it, then as the hurt is,
and as the prick is neglected or ill governed, the accidents mentioned may
follow.

9. Also the heads of the Muscles when they are hurt by the Lancet; will cause
great symptoms, and when their Tendons, are wounded there follows defect in
motion, it might be then well concluded, That this malady came from the hurt
and puncture of the Nerve; because of the Pain with a numbness and other
accidents, which she felt, after he opened the Vein. Platerus, l b. 1. page 159.

XIX. A Contraction of both Hands and Feet.

1. A certain Woman was above half a year afflicted with a Contraction of both
Hands, and the distortion of the Heel of both her Feet, insomuch that she could
not move, stand, nor go; mucilaginous humors having troubled the Tendons and
Nerves.

2. By the advice of another Physician Ointments and Baths made of the
decoction of diverse Herbs were used without any good to the Patient: my advice
being taken; I ordered, the Body being first purged, the following things.

3. Take Mechoacan, one dram and half: Scammony, seven grains: Cream of Tartar,
half a scruple: with Honey of Rosemary flowers, make a Lohoch; afterward take
roots of Elecampane, Fennel, Orrice, of each two drams: Wormwood, Carduus,
Betony, Bawm, Rosemary-flowers, of each one pugil: the leaves of Sena, one
ounce and half: Agarick trochiscated three drams: Turbith, Hermodacts, of each
two drams and half: Mechoacan, two drams: Cream of Tartar, one dram and half:
Cinnamon, one dram: Galangal, two scruple: make a bag: then infuse it into
Hydromel; she being very hard and much bound in her Belly; she took four ounces
thereof every day.

4. There was also prescribed a decoction of Lignum Sanctum, Sarsa-parilla,
with a little Sassafras.

5. But that which did very much good, was Emplastrum Diaphoreticum Adriani
Mynfichti: Take Ship-pitch, three ounces and half: gum Ammoniaci, choice
Turpentine, of each one ounce: Colophonia, Bdellium, of each two ounces: white
Frankincense, Mastich, of each two drams: gum-Juniper, Galbanum dissolved in
Vinegar, of each half an ounce: juice of Citrons, one ounce and half and two
drams: Yellow Wax, five ounces and half: make an Emplaster; which being spread
upon linen, is to be applied to the Feet about the Heel; twice a day renewing
it, this had a good effect.

6. Here follows an Ointment for the Hands: Take Mans-fat, Bears and Wolves
fat, of each two drams: Badgers fat, three drams: dissolve, add the Oil of
Foxes, two drams: mix them, being removed from the fire, add the Oil of Annis,
half a dram: Oil of Wax, half an ounce: By these things we did her so much good
that she could stretch out her Hands, take Food and walk.

7. Lastly, for greater strengthening we advised to the use of a Bath of the
decoction of Herbs with a mixture of Mineralds; the form of the Bath is thus:
Take Alum, Sulphur, Bay Berries, of each one pound: the Berries and tops of
Juniper, the leaves of Sage, of each one handful: bruise them all in a mortar;
then being put up into a bag, boil them all in water for a bath. The half of
this mixture is to be used for one bathing; and it is to be continued for three
days. Thonerus, lib. 2. Observe. 5.

XX. A Pain and Contraction of the Back.

1. A Gentleman being miserably afflicted with a Pain and Contraction of the
Back, from a defluxion upon the Nerves, was freed by the following Ointment.

2. Take Vnguentum Aregon, Martiatum, Agrippae, of each two drams: Oil of
Cammomil, Oils of Dill and Lillys, of each one dram: Oils of Earthworms, and of
Foxes, of each one dram and half: Badgers-fat, Man's, and Foxes grease, of each
half a dram: mix and anoint the parts with it warm. Thonerus, lib. 2. Observe. 3.

SCHOLIA. The THEORY of CONTRACTURES.
By the Author W. Salmon.
XXI. The Pathology of Contractures or Contractions, and first of the Notation
thereof.

1. The Names. This Disease is called (...), Contractio, the Contraction or
shrinking up of a part: as also from the parts which are contracted, (which are
for the most part the Nerves or Tendons) (...), Contractio Nervi, (...), Nervus
contractus: and from the Effect (...), Nervus corneus, vel callosus: (...),
Callus Tendinum, A Callous and horn-like Nerve or Tendon.

2. The Definition. A Contraction is a preternatural Tumor in a Muscle,
hardening and shrinking up a Nerve or Tendon in the same, whereby the Parts
adjacent are attracted to it, and as it were bound up, so as they cannot be
stretched out.

3. The Kinds or Differences. Sometimes but one Nerve or Tendon is contracted:
Sometimes many: as in a Contraction of the Wrist, and other Joints, where many
Tendons meet. It is either new and not wholly confirmed, or confirmed and of a
bone-like hardness. It differs also according to the Situation of the Parts:
in some the Contraction is in the Arm against the Elbow: in others the Fingers
are contracted: in some the Hams are contracted: in others the Toes: and in
some the Musculus latus, which causes a wry Neck.

XXII. The Signs of a Contracture.

1. The principal Signs of a Contracture are manifest by the Definition. as, 1.
Tumor in the Muscle. 2. a hardening of the Nerve or Tendon. 3. a shrinking up or
shortning of the same.

2. Where these three Symptoms of a Contracture happens, there is also (for the
most part) an Attraction, or drawing up of the adjacent Part: but this is more
or less eminent according to the Magnitude of the Contraction.

3. If one Tendon only be contracted the Tumor is not only the less, but the
Attraction almost inconsiderable: but if many Tendons or Nerves be contracted,
the Tumor is the greater, and the Attraction very manifest to the Senses.

4. If the matter contracted, be very hard, so as that it is arived to a boney
or horn-like hardness, the Disease is then confirmed: but this is most common
where the Nerves or Tendons are very small or slender, by reason of which they
the more easily admit of Arefaction.

5. Lastly, a Contracture is known by feeling, there being always an external
hardness of the Part, not much unlike to the streining of a Cord or Bow-string;
and this for the most part in the hollow or bending of the Joint.

XXIII. Of the Causes of a Contracture.

1. The Causes of a Contracture are manifold, though the first and prime Cause
is or can be but one, to wit, a deficience or cutting off of the animal
Spirits, and a siccasion or drying up of the neurotick Juice, and this may be
sometimes caused by a Scirrhus or Node arising from the Excrements in the
Muscles, especially about the Tendons, where many meet near the Joints, as is
oftentimes to be seen in the bending of the Elbow, Wrists, Ham, etc. wherein,
the Hand in the one, and the Foot in the other are drawn upwards, the one
inwards as it were, the other outward or backward.

2. It sometimes also comes to pass by a Callous in a Muscle, Nerve, or Tendon,
which may be caused from a Wound, by which they were wounded, wherein, though
they were not wholly cut in two, yet by the gathering together of the lips of
the Wound, it contracts or shortens the body or tail of the Muscle, and causes
that Part into which it is inserted, to be more or less bound up; the which
also has sometimes come to pass in a wound of the temporal Muscle, wherein the
Mouth was so drawn up, that it would scarcely admit any thing of Food, although
the most liquid. And in this case it is clear, that there is a cutting off of
the animal Spirits; and while Nature is endeavoring to restore the Part
whereby to entertain the Spirits in their Channels, she, by reason of their
absence, and loss of the neurotick Juice, forms only a Callous; whence is the
generation of a matter which perpetually obstructs the Motion and Course of the
said Spirits, and consequently of that softning Juice, which in part
contributes to the constitution of the said Nerves and Tendons.

3. There being thus a Siccation of the Muscles, or the Tendons, and with them
sometimes the Nerves inserted into them being as it were wrinckled, shrunk, or
bound up, they become hardened, and resemble a Callous, so as that they cannot
be extended or bent, and so in what Situation they remain, in the same posture
also they keep the member into which they are implanted, fixed and immovable,
which is either more or less contracted, according to the urgency of the first
Cause: and these things sometimes come to pass in old Age, or by reason of too
much and long continued Labor, which too plentifully exhausting the animal
Spirits, causes the Parts to become stiff, and diversely crooked, with a kind of
horney hardness of the part, as may be seen in the Hands and Fingers of such as
continually use hard work, or hold hard things therein, as beating with a
Pestel in a Mortar, For here the Pores being mightily opened by the continual
grasping of that heavy and hard matter, there is first a too great exhausting
of the animal Spirits in the part: secondly, a loss of part of the neurotick
Juice, Blisters being raised: these it is true, after the first or second
occasion would easily grow well again, and the Parts come to their prist in
State: but a continual Exercise of the same Work, as it is a continuation of
the Cause, so at length, it causes so great an Irregularity, as is scarcely
ever to be retrieved.

4. And the reason is the same in those who have crooked Backs, and cannot
raise themselves up straight, for that they have for a long time carried heavy
Burdens; for which Cause the animal Spirits being obstructed in their Course,
are driven back to their Center, and the neurotick Juice likewise in like
manner exhausted, by unnatural Swearing, and other insensible ways of
Evacuation, and withal, a continuation of such like drudgery for several
years, an evil habit is at length caused; so that for the want of Spirits, and
exsiccation of the nervous Juice, these wretched Creatur^s go all their days
after bending downwards: and these things may also come to pass in those who
have long and often labored under a Tetanos, or other Species of Convulsions;
from whence there is the same loss of Spirits and exsiccation of the said
neurotick Juice: the which humor being wasted by the aforementioned causes,
such a Consumption and leaness appears manifestly in the Muscles of the Limbs,
even outwardly, especially in the greater, that their Nerves and Tendons feem
to consist rather of Fibers than Flesh, and to represent dry Cords, rather than
soft Nerves.

5. This is also caused in part, from a defect of Fat, which is wont first of
all to be wasted, by the aforesaid causes; when as, it growing both
extrinsically to their Membranes, and being intrinsically inbred with the
Fibers of certain of the greater Muscles chiefly, anointing and bathing them
therewith, as it were, that they might be the easier extended and contracted in
Motion; being now deprived thereof, renders them unfit for motion; whence also
follows a Consumption of that which Physicians call Ros, Cambium Gluten, or
Glue, with which the Tendons in like manner are wont to be smeared: all which
happens oftentimes from the force of an external Heat being too great, and
persevering long, which does as it were shrink up the Tendons and Muscles, as
well as dry them.

6. Hence, the Difference between a Convulsion and a Contraction is much more
manifest: a Convulsion proceeds only from the Irritation of the Nerves, not
their exsiccation: but a Contraction from the exsiccation of the said Nerves,
either from too frequent and long Irritations, or the Causes first above
mentioned, which every Artist is desired to take notice of: and so it appears
that a Convulsion is only a hurt of the animal Spirits in the Genus Nervosum,
etc. A Contraction, a cutting them off, from the Part affected, whence arises
the aforesaid exsiccation and shrinking up. But such an exsiccation can
scarcely be caused from any internal heat, though in the most burning Fevers:
And in an Hectic, the Body being otherwise almost wasted, yet the Members do
not appear contracted, except by accident in the Tongue, or in the Midriff,
being over dried, etc.

7. After these manners the Muscles almost proper to every part may be hurt;
whence only particular Contractions of those Parts do ensue: Of one Part only
if its particular Muscle be hurt: Or more, if one Muscle send Tendons to many
Parts; but these things never simply befall a Nerve, being so small and slender
a Part, but they may be effected in the Tendon of a Muscle, because it is so
strong.

8. Some Authors say, That a Contraction may be caused from a pituitous or
encrementitious humor falling upon, and filling the body of the Muscle, or
Tendons, which being thereby distended and made shorter, it thereby attracts
the Part into which it is inserted, from whence they infer, that a Contraction
may be caused: but I should rather think, that if an humor fallen down upon the
Muscles, possesses their spaces, by which they are joined together, that it
should rather cause a Pain, and upon that account, a difficulty of motion than
a Contraction of the Part; and if it bedew or smeer the Nerves or Tendons, a
Palsy should rather ensue.

9. And this is a certain Truth, that the Parts being deprived of animal
Spirits, their Functions must necessarily cease; for from them are communicated
to the Muscles the Power of moving, and to the sensible Parts the Power of
feeling: and therefore if the Nerve be wholly destitute of them, the remaining
Part thereof, from the place affected, even to the Part into which it is
inserted becomes useless: the same comes to pass, if its continuity with the
Part be broken, for then the passage of the said animal Spirits is interrupted.
And this may be sometimes when the Nerves are so straightned, that the animal
Spirits, which require a free passage through them, can no longer pass, or fill
them up, or not sufficiently; for that, though they be most thin and subtle,
and do illustrate the Nerves, like the Rays of the Sun, yet nevertheless they
may be hindered, even, as the Sunbeams also may be stopped: And this happens if a
Nerve or Tendon be so pressed in any part of it, that its substance does wholly
sink down: Or if its substance be so condensed also, whereby the passage of the
said Spirits are interrupted.

10. And the same may come to pass (as well as from a solution of continuity,
straightness of the Nerves, condensation, preternatural Tumor, simple
Distemper, etc.) from some fault of the Organ, which may arise either from
internal or external Causes; hurts by compression, ligatures, blows etc.
whereby plenty of humor flowing from the adjacent Parts, in those narrow
places, compresses the Nerves with its weight, whereby is intercepted the
passages of the animal Spirits, as is aforesaid: the which being detained, by
so much the longer stop, by so much the more the humors become thicker and
mucous, which cooling and compressing the substance of the Nerves or Tendons,
destroys their proper temper, and so hinders them from ever being filled with,
or enjoying the said animal Spirits any more.

11. And truly this was the reason why we handled Contractures in this place;
for although they seem to be rather Diseases of the extreme Parts, yet being
for the most part (if not always) caused from a hurt of the animal Spirits and
Functions, the Fountain of which resides in the Brain; we thought good rather
to treat of the same, amongst Diseases of the Head, and therefore have here
added these few Observations, and brief Theory, as an Appendix to the Chapter
of Convulsions: being the first that ever we saw in print of this kind,

XXIV. The Prognostics of Contractures.

1. Contractions proceeding from Dryness or In^nition of the Muscles or their
Tendons that draw the Member, or of the Nerves, or Ligaments that encompass the
Joints, are very difficult to be cured.

2. If they have been of long standing, or they consist of a boney hardness, or
happen in any principal Part, whether in the Back, or other places, are
scarcely ever cured, and so much the more, if they proceed from, or are caused
by old Age, or extreme hard Labor.

3. If a Contraction be recent in a tender Part, and it is not extremely
hardened, and in a young or growing Person; there is hopes of Cure, if timely
and proper means be used.

4. Contractions of a horney substance in the Hands or Feet, proceeding from
long and hard Labor, are hardly ever cured; and more especially those that
proceed from a Tetanos; for those for the most part remain, and the Contraction
continues as long as Life lasts, or is at most, but little changed for the
better.

5. Contractions from a solution of Continuity, where the whole Muscle, Nerve,
or Tendon, are cut in two, are seldom or never taken away: Contractions also in
the Back, from old Age are incurable.

6. A Contraction arising from over-straining of a Part, or Tumor of the
Muscle, may be cured while recent; but with much difficulty after it has
contracted an absolute horney and callous-like hardness: and truly from hence
it is, that such like Cures are not common to be met with in Authors.

XXV. The Method of curing Contractures.

1. As to the Cure of this Disease, we can do nothing singular by things taken
inwardly, unless by accident; as in relation to things strengthening the Nerves:
and in those cases, where it may arise from a Spasm or Cramp, or Convulsion
going before: wherein Antispasmatioks and Neuroticks may be found proper, an
Enumeration of which you may find in their respect^ve places in the former
Chapter, at also in the Chapter of the Palsy hereafter ensuing.

2. However, that we may inculcate the most proper Internals if any be used,
the Powder, Tinctures, and Powers of Musk and Ambergrise transcend all other
things, or the volatile Salts of Vipers, Swallows, Hartshorn, and Mag-pies, as
also the volatile Salts of Peacocks, and Peacocks Dung. Take Musk, twelve
grains: Ambergrise, volatile Salt of Vipers, of each six grains: mix and make a
Powder to be given three or four hours after meat at Night going to bed. Or
thus. Take Musk, sixteen grains: volatile Salt of Magpies, eight grains:
Viper-pouder, a scruple: mix them for a Powder to be given as aforesaid.

3. Now this is to be observed in the giving of these and the like things, that
you may suffer the Patient to be so covered as to be moved only into a very
gentle Sweat, for thereby the vital and animal Spirits are excited, and made to
move more vigorously out of one Part into another: but you must be cautious
that you suffer no great Sweat, for those wast not simply the Spirits (which
ought to be only stirred not exhausted) but also the natural mucilaginous
humor, or humidum radicale, which is the chief thing wanting, and by loss of
which the Part is already made of a callous substance, or horn-like hardness.

4. As to Topics, you ought first to apply to the Part afflicted humecting and
laxating Medicines, which have a gentle, heating and resolving Property: but
because things of a relaxing Property do for the most part cool, you must mix
hot things with them, being also proper and specific Neuroticks, which are to
be applied to the Muscle and its Tendon, as also to the adjacent Parts which
are contracted or drawn up, and indeed to the whole Joint, if the Ligaments are
withal shrunk up.

5. If the Backbone, to wit, its Muscles, Nerves, and Tendons are contracted,
through the long affliction of a Tetanos you may anoint with this. Take Oil of
sweet Almonds, two ounces: Oil of Aniseeds, one ounce: mix them. But before you
use this, it will not be amiss, if the Pores of the Part affected be in some
little measure opened, by the use of the Powers of Aniseeds simple, being
bathed for a while upon the place: For Aniseeds are a certain specific in the
loosning of a Contracture in any Part of the Body, comforting the Nerve by its
gentle heat, suavity, and sweetness, and in some measure dissolving the matter
of the Contraction; and therefore it is that in all Contractures the Spirit,
Powers, or Oil, or some of them are constantly used, either, alone; or with
some other mixture; nor do we know any other simple thing that has the like
Force in resolving contracted or shrunk-up Parts. And therefore it is for the
same reason, that whatever things those may be, which may be hereafter applied
in resolving of any Contracture in any Part of the Body whatsoever, we always
make use first of the Spirit or Powers of Aniseeds; for the opening of the
closed Pores of the Part, that the things which are after to be applied for the
more complete relaxing of the Part shrunk up, may take the better Effect.

6. The Contracture then, having been for some few minutes before hand bathed
with the Spirit or Powers of Aniseeds; you afterward anoint with the
Composition in the former Section: or with this following. Take Oils of sweet
Almonds, of Ben, and of Line-seed (all newly made by Expression,) of each an
ounce: Oil of Hypericon, an ounce and half: Oil of Earthworms, two ounces: Oil
of Aniseeds chemical, three ounces: mix them together to anoint the contracted
Part with-all.

7. Some Authors commend this: Take Oil of sweet Almonds, one ounce and half:
Oil of Line-seed by expression, Oils of Violets, of Lillys, of Camomil and of
Earthworms, of each one ounce: Oil of Hypericon; Mucilage, of the seeds of
Fleawort, and Line-seed, Ducks grease, the Marrow of Calves-leggs, of each half
an ounce: Turpentine, two drams: Sulphur, two drams and half: powder of Worms,
one dram, flowers of Hypericon and Saffron, of each half a dram: Wax a
sufficient quantity: mix and make a Cerot not too hard. It is a Medicine of
good use: but if Oil of Aniseed, one ounce, had been added, it had been much
more powerful: however if things be applied plasterwise, there is not many
things which transcend the common Emplastr. de minio mad with Vinegar without
Wax, boiled to a soft consistence, and linen cloths to be dipped in it, whilst
it is yet blood-red, or before it comes to the changing of its color,
experience has confirmed it as a most admirable thing. And what may take place
next is the Diasulphuris Rulandi, whose effects in resolving of Contractures,
are very eminent.

8. The grease or fat of Eels is said to be singular; and an appropriate or
Specific thing, for that it is very humid and relaxing, but that which yet
transcends all these things, is Man's grease; and Vipers fat is thought to
exceed that: However, before the use of them, it will be good to bath first
with Spirits or Powers of Aniseeds; then the part may be fomented with some of
these things applied warm, as Mineral waters, simple spring water, Cows milk,
fat broth of the head and entrails of a Sheep, Calf or Kid: or Water and Oil
mixed together; Or Oil and Wine which is better, Or Oil alone, chiefly that of
Violets or of Earthworms.

9. Or you may make the bath and fomentation with this following Decoction:
Take fresh roots of Althaea, Bryony, and Lillys, of each a pound: Earthworms,
shell-Snails, of each half a pound: Mallows, Violets, Arrach, Lettise,
Coleworts, of each a handful: Sage Ground Pine, of each half a handful:
Aniseeds bruised, four ounces: Line-seed, two ounces: boil them in water for a
Bath; to every quart of which decoction, add at time of using of it Powers of
Aniseeds, two ounces: Oil of Tartar per deliquium, one ounce: mix them together
for either a bath, or fomentation, or both, as you see need requires. Sulphur
Baths are said to have a great virtue to mollefy and relax, because nothing is
fatter than Sulphur: and therefore if you can meet with no natural Sulphur
baths near you, you may make one after this manner: Take spring water, two
gallons: Salt of Tartar, four ounces: flowers of Sulphur, six ounces: boil them
well together for an hour and half: stirring it continually, being sufficiently
boiled you may weaken it with a sufficient quantity of fresh warm water, and so
use it; adding with all, also at time of using of it to every quart of the
liquor two ounces of the powers of Aniseeds, as aforesaid.

10. The Contracture being thus first bathed with the simple Spirit or Powers
of Aniseeds; then with some of the former Baths, or fomented, as aforesaid; it
will be then convenient (if the Contracture be very strong) to apply to it for
some time Cataplasms, which may be made according to these following forms:
Take pulp of Turnips, white Bread, of each a pound: Oat-meal, half a pound:
make it of a due consistence by adding Oil of Earthworms, or Man's, or Vipers
fat, or a little Nerve-Oyl: mixing also therewith at time of application, with
every pound of the pultise half an ounce of the Oil of Aniseeds: but if the
Patient be of a very hot constitution and complexion, then mix therewith only
two drams: yet in a cold and moist habit, you may increase the proportion to
six drams without any detriment, such is the difference of Men's Bodies. Or
thus: Take pulp of Turnips and of Bryony-roots, of each two pounds: Oat-meal
(well boiled with Milk, to a convenient thickness of Past) a pound and half:
Gelly of Hartshorn, Gelly of Hogs feet, of each a pound: powder of
Orrice-root, Venice Soap, of each half a pound: Barley flower enough to make it
of a due consistence: mix and make all into a Cataplasm, to every pound of
which add (at time of using) Oil of Aniseeds, from two drams to six.

11. Some also make a Cataplasm of the Call, Mesentery, Kidney, Liver, Spleen,
or Lungs, of a Hog, Lamb, Sheep, Kid, Calf, etc. being newly killed, and the
said parts or other intrails, applied to the Contracture warm; which ought to
be kept long on, and to be often repeated; the good effects of these things,
will be beyond expectation, if the Patient be not uncurable.

12. Platerus commends this Cataplasm, as a very excellent thing: Take fresh
roots of Althea, of Bryony, of each two ounces: of Mandrakes, one ounce: fresh
leaves of Henbane (which I have known, says he, as also Mandrakes, do wonders
in molifying) mallows, of each one handful: boil them in Milk, bruise them, and
add thereto Meal of Line-seed, two ounces: of Fleawort-seed, Seeds of Quinces,
of each half an ounce: Hogs and Goose-grease, of each one ounce: Oil of sweet
Almonds, fresh Butter, of each half an ounce: Barberies, two drams: Saffron
half a dram: mix and make a Cataplasm. This may be a good thing, as the Author
says, but it would be much better, if in stead of the Hogs or Goose-grease, you
add double quantities of Vipers and Mans-fat: and in stead of the Oil of
Almonds and fresh Butter, Balsam of Sulphur and Oil of Earthworms, adding also
at time of using of it, a small quantity of the Oil of Aniseeds, as before
advised.

13. Skins of Beasts newly killed, pulled off and applied are excellent, the
Contracture being first bathed with Powers of Aniseeds, then with the anisated
Balsam of Sulphur: Fox-skins are specially commended for the purpose, and a
Goose-skin with the Feathers; but the Skin of a Lamb, Sheep, Kid, Calf, Bullock
Ox, etc. are not to be despised, being all of excellent use: a fresh Cats-skin
is also praised in this Case: but above all a Dogs-hide, which some say, has so
great a Power of resolving or relaxing, as to make the contracted Muscle,
Nerve, or Tendons, too largely to extend themselves.

14. The use of Baths, Anointings, Fomentations, with the applications of
Cataplasms and skins as aforesaid, having been for a fit time used, you may now
come to the application of fit and proper Cerots or Emplasters, among which the
two former have few that excel, mentioned at 7. aforegoing: to these you may
add Emplastrum de Galbano Mynsichti, and his de Galbano Crocatum, both which
are things of admirable use for this purpose: others (not without cause)
commend the Cerot of Ammoniacum of Forestus, which he kept as a great Secret
for a long time, for the dissolving of any hard Tumor: you may see it in our
Pharmacopoeia Londinensis lately published: and the Emplaster of Ammoniacum
with Hemlock, in my opinion is no way inferior: all these Emplasters would yet
be much more effectual if toward the end of their making up a proportionable
quantity of Oil of Aniseeds were added, as in other Medicines we have directed:
A Friend of mine, and a very ingenious Man a Chyrurgion, mightily commended to
me the use of the chemical Oil of Wax, either used alone, or mixed with other
things; as Fat of Vipers, Mans-Grease, etc. as a thing which had scarcely any
Equal.

15. If the contracted Members can be separated by manual operation (being
otherwise uncurable) then, though they be not made moveable again (the which
yet sometimes comes to pass) nevertheless another form may be fitted for them,
which brings a less obstacle to the motion: as if the Fingers being extended,
be stopped, they are less prejudicial in catching hold of things, than if they be
contracted: if the Foot remain contracted or drawn upwards; being relaxed back
again to the ground (although by cutting) though the Joint of the Knee remain
fixed, yet it restores the going, which before was taken away:

16. This we may sometimes do in some places with our Hands, or by application
of Instuments (without cutting) forcing the contracted Part down daily, not
with a great force, but by little and little, in process of time, more and more
relaxing the bound-up Tendons and Ligaments, and that according to the nature
of the Member contracted, diverse ways; as if by reason of the Joint of the Knee
fixed, as it often comes to pass, the Foot is drawn upwards, by continually
drawing it down, while they sit, or are doing any thing; or by hanging a Weight
to it, oftentimes depressing it: the which will be neatly performed, if two
oblong Plates, hollow in the middle, filled to the Leg, and hinder part of the
Hips, and joined about the Joint, by Interposition of an Engine and turning it,
as long as the Patient is able to endure, the Foot be forced by degrees from
the upper Part downwards.

17. Also it is conveniently performed in other places after the same manner by
an Engine fitted with Screws, commonly called a Compress; (the Figures of which
for some particular Parts, you may see in my Synopsis Medicinae, with their
particular Explication and Use (because if it be turned by degrees, pressing
Parts, to which it is applied, it forces the fixed Member: and because the
Engine or Instrument so turned, remains immovable, the same does return and
sustain the Member, as far as it shall have forced or thrust it; the which we
have made trial of with Success, the Instrument being neatly and ingeniously
made.

18. Moreover, if a Finger remains extended, a Ring being put upon it, which
must be contiguous, and made fast to another Ring, applied on the next Finger;
whiles this Finger is moved, the other which is fixed being continually forced,
will be at length constrained to yield and bow. And indeed all fixed Members, if
they be very prejudicial in that Situation, they must be continually drawn
into a better and less incongruous Form, by Force either of Instuments or
otherwise, as we said even now.

19. If the loss or hurt of motion be by a hard Tumor, Callous, or Skar,
affixed to the Tendons and Ligaments; and by which also there is a compression
of the Nerve, whereby a Palsy (as it were) is caused in some other Part, there
can be no other kind of Cure but by the use of Emollients, such as we have
above rehearsed: but if a Palsy should be caused from a Compression of the
Nerve by reason of too hard Ligature, or closeness of the compress, then the
Ligatures must be loosned, or the Instrument removed and taken away; which
done, if a numbness or Palsy does still continue, the Spirits must be recalled
by long and strong frictions, and application of Neuroticks and
Antiparaliticks, and such as are Powers of Amber, of Aniseeds, of Castoreum,
and such like.

20. Lastly, having tried all external means that are before mentioned, in
vain: before you come to the use of Instruments or Cutting, you may make trial
of Mercuriates which have an exceeding great power of Resolution and performing
in this kind more than all other things upon Earth, however in this Case you
must make use of your Mercury Crude as it were, to wit, either made into an
Amalgama with Lead or Tin, or killed with Spittle or juice of Limons, and then
mixed with some proper Cerot, or soft Emplaster, which has a natural dissolving
power joined with it: Or you may use Vigo's Emplastrum de Ranis with three,
four or six times the proportion of Mercury to what is ordinarily prescribed:
and in the same proportion you may mix it with other Emplastick Bodies: you may
use it Emplasterwise without danger: and the Mercury must be mixed in the
proportion aforesaid, or else it will perform next to nothing, If this does
not, you must be necessitated either to use the compress with fitted Screws, or
come to cutting.

The AUTHORS Observations.
I. Incubus or Nightmare.

1. A Young Man about twenty five years of age, was for several years troubled
with this Disease, and so great a weight seemed to oppress his Stomach that be
could not stir any part of his Body, it seized upon him commonly between
sleeping and waking, and so to the apprehension of the sick, he strove mightily
with himself, but when he came to himself, he found no member out of its place.

2. First, when it came, it was toward the latter part of the night, and he
had but few fits, which came sometimes once or twice a week, in process of time
they were more frequent; and at length came to that exorbitancy, that they
would return fifteen or twenty times in a night, with a certain kind of
fearfulness, so that the Patient was not able to endure them.

3. The next day he looked pale, as if his Eyes were sunk in his Head; And as
the vulgar phrase is, as if he had been hag-ridden.

4. He was of a gross and corpulent Body, would eat plentifully, and drunk
freely without undergoing any kind of labor or exercise, coming to me, he
requested my help, and I cured him with the following things,

5. First I cleansed his Stomach with a fit dose of Crocus Metallorum, every
other day this was repeated for three times. Afterward I ordered his Body to
be purged with my Family Pills with Aloes, the use of which were repeated six
times, taking a dose every fifth or sixth day.

6. In the interim he drank constantly this following decoction: Take Rosemary,
Sage, sweet Marjoram, Thyme, Winter-savory, of each four ounces: boil them in a
sufficient quantity of Spring Water, till the quarter part be consumed, then
strain out without expression; sweeten it with double refined Sugar, and bottel
it up with a Clove in each bottle, of which the sick took one every day.

7. Moreover I ordered his Stomach to be anointed with Oil of Mace by
expression, every Morning and Night, and for some few days at the beginning of
the Cure, Rose cakes dipped in Vinegar of Roses were bound warm to his Temples at
Night going to bed; by the use of these means, the fits were not only suddenly
abated, but the Patient was in about six weeks time perfectly cured.

8. A Maid servant also in the same family was cured of the same Disease by
using the same means, with very little difference.

II. The Incubus or Nightmare in a very aged Man.

1. Although this Disease is seldom or never cured in aged people, but that for
the most part it degenerates into an Apoplexy, of which they die, yet this in
my opinion is rather from the formal than efficient cause, For as much as if
the Incubus proceeds from a bladder of water in the Brain, which I twice saw in
persons that died Apoplectick, the Disease may be supposed to be incurable.

2. But where the formal cause, is either from a distemperature of the Stomoach
or disaffection of the Spleen, whereby an excrementitious Blood or vapors are
generated in the Brain; in this case I cannot conceive but this Disease may be
cured in persons of what age soever, provided no other mortal symptom interveen
from any other present cause, and without doubt this latter is the case of our
present Patient.

3. For although he was very aged, and had been for many years troubled with
this Distemper, yet the Paroxysms of this Disease were never excited in him,
but upon eating food of evil juice, or some disorder, or Intemperature in his
Diet, or excess in Drink, or from the quality of the things received.

4. For when he drank strong Wines he was sure to be troubled with it the next
Night, so also when he did eat red Herrings; nor could he remember that he ever
in his life, but that he had some fits the next night after the eating of red
Herings, so also after other things which bred wind and vapors, from which so
long as he abstained, so long he would be commonly free.

5. But at length being wearied with the reiteration of them by reason of his
age, he desired of me if possible some remedy, but I knowing how difficult it
was to perform such a Cure in old people, was loath to undertake it.

6. However at length by many persuasions, I gave him the following things:
Take fair water, twelve quarts: Fumitory, Spleen-wort, Maidenhair, Angelica,
Borage, Bugloss, Missleto of the Oak, of each one handful: fresh Polypody-roots
bruised, twelve ounces: boil all to the consumption of almost the half: In the
scalding liquour infuse for a day and a night the best Alexandrian Sena, three
ounces: Caraways bruised six drams: after strain out without pressing; sweeten
it with double refined Sugar, and bottle it up for use, of this he drank about
a pint a day, which gently purged him every day, whereby the old man had much
relief.

7. After the taking of these bottles, I ordered him to take Elixir
proprietatis from twenty to thirty drops, in a glass of Sack twice a day for
about a month together, by this means his Stomach was so strengthened, that the
generation of Crudities and vapors were for the future prevented; so that the
person could eat the things above named without being vexed with fits following
the same; nor so far as I could learn, was he ever troubled with them any more
till his dying day.

III. The Incubus or Nightmare in a person that was troubled with a Rupture.

1. This Disease is of pernicious consequence in those troubled with Ruptures,
unless they be very careful of themselves; although there be little or no
motion of the parts, yet there is a great perturbation of the Spirits which
sometimes increases the Rupture of the Peritoneum as it fell out in this our
Patient.

2. For when the fits first seized him, the Rupture was very small and
inconsiderable, but after the fits Increased upon him and grew strong, although
he was one that did no exercise nor labor; yet the Rupture was considerably
augmented, of which he could render no other reason but his great striving or
struggling in the night, as he thought.

3. Which indeed although there was no real stirring of the parts, might come
to pass here as in another like case, where a fissure or fracture of the Skull
is made on one side by striking a blow on the other.

4. And it has been observed in several Examples, that many people from the
mere turgency of the Spirits, have had Varicis and Anurisms made, which are
Diseases far more wonderful and unlikely to be made by the Actions of the
Spirit than that which we here treat of.

5. This person being very much afflicted and troubled in his mind by reason of
the Rupture, made his application to me, whom I Cured after the method
following.

6. First, I caused a gentle Clyster to be given, made of emollient herbs,
afterward I exhibited another stronger, in which was put three ounces of
Crocus Metallorum.

7. Then I caused his Body to be gently purged with the following Decoction:
Take spring water, three quarts: of the best Sena, three ounces: Sal Prunellae,
two drams: digest in a gentle heat twenty four hours, strain them out without
pressing, of this the sick drank half a pint every Morning.

8. In the mean season, I caused the Rupture to be bathed Morning and Evening
with Elixir proprietatis, with the application of a substantial truss, which
truss I ordered him to wear Night and Day, after his purgative potions were
over.

9. I ordered him to take Elixir proprietatis twenty five or thirty drops at a
time, in a glass of choice Canary or Tent, the which he did with good success.
For after a months time the Paroxysm of his Disease returned no more, and the
Patient seemed to be perfectly cured.

10. But as to the Rupture after a months bathing of it with Elixir
protrietatis, I caused him to apply our Rupture Plaster of Ox-galls, with the
truss aforementioned; by the assiduous and constant wearing of which he
confessed the said Rupture to be consolidated in little more than three months
time; the composition, preparation, virtues and use of this Rupture Plaster you
may see in our Doron Medicum, lib. 3. cap. 6. sect. 1. to which I refer you.

IV. An Incubus or Nightmare, with Vomiting.

1. This person was a young Woman lately married, after which she was
exceedingly troubled with the Incubus every Night, so that she could have no
quiet, and the affliction was so extreme, that she oftimes protested she was
afraid to go to Bed, nor could she lie down on the bed in the daytime, but if
she fell never so little in a flumber, she was sure to be overtaken with fits
of the Incubus.

2. Moreover all the time she was afflicted with these Paroxysms, she had an
exteream and assiduous vomiting, so that she could scarcely keep any food in
her Belly, whereupon she became exceedingly ill, so that most people concluded
her to be in a most deep Consumption.

3. Yet had she neither Cough, wheasing nor spitting, being in this sad
condition, she desired my assistance, whereupon hearing the relation of her
Distemper, as abovesaid; I concluded there must be a mighty foulness of the
Stomach, which was the chief cause of all her Evils.

4. Whereupon after the exhibition of an emollient Clyster, I gave her this
following emetick dose: Take infusion of Crocus Metallorum, six drams: salt of
Vitriol, two scruples: white Wine, three ounces: mix them together, it was
given in the morning fasting; it produced eight vomits and ten or twelve stools.

5. The matter first vomited up, seemed to be a tough viscous or thick Phlegm,
afterward there came forth a matter thick, yellow, green and of almost all
sorts of colors; such a horrible kind of filthiness with stink, that I never
saw to come from any Patient before, and that also in an excessive quantity.

6. For this cause sake, I repeated the same dose again, it brought forth
matter again much like the former, but nothing so plentiful a quantity; the
same dose I reiterated once more, by which means her Stomach was very
thoroughly cleansed, so that she seemed to be a new Creature; hereby not only
her vomiting but also the Paroxysms of the Incubus were totally abolished.

7. However to consummate a perfect cure, I ordered her to take the
Quintessence or powers of Wormwood every morning fasting, and half an hour
before Dinner, the which she did for a month together and so was made perfectly
well.

V. An Incubus in an old Gentlewoman, with running pains.

1. This old Matron being about sixty years of age, had an old running Sore
upon one of her Legs, which had been opened for near fourteen years, being
weary of the trouble of it she sought for a Cure, and at length she me^ with a
Chyrurgion who both undertook and performed it, but I think much to her
disadvantage.

2. For, as before she lived as it were in perfect health, now she was troubled
with running pains all over her whole Body; nauseousness or loathing of the
Stomach, and sometimes vomiting, together with a kind of Vertigo in the
daytime, and the Incubus or Nightmare in the night.

3. She related her case to me, upon which after a little consideration, seeing
there was a complication of Diseases, I advised her to the following things;
first my counsel was, that she should have a couple of Issues made, one in each
Thigh or Leg, which run very well for some weeks, to wit, ten or twelve.

4. This done, I caused her to take daily Tinctura Sacra or infusion of species
Hiera picra, in white Wine or other Wine the quantity of two spoonfuls or
thereabouts, the which she did for near twenty days together; whereby all her
griefs seemed to vanish, and she became lightsom and cheerful as she was before.

5. However that we might corroborate the Tone of the parts, and strengthen the
animal and vital Faculties; I caused her to take the following drops; every
Morning fasting and last every Night going to Bed, for a month or two or three
together.

6. Take powers of Rosemary, three ounces: powers of Juniper Berries, two
ounces: powers of Sassafras, one ounce: mix them for use, Dose from twenty to
forty drops, in a glass of generous Canary at the time aforementioned.

VI. The Nightmare in a young Maiden of sixteen years old.

1. This Maiden as yet had not had her Courses, looked pale, had a bad Stomach,
was troubled with vomiting and Indigestion of her Food, and at certain times
had some short fits of the Vertigo: but the great matter which molested her was
a mighty affliction of the Incubus or Nightmare; which sometimes was so
troublesome and vehement, that she feared a stoppage of her Breath in the Night,
for which cause she was offen afraid to go to Bed.

2. Moreover to these things there was adjoined a Melancholy habit of Body,
with strange apprehension of terrible things, which would then extremely
disturb her, so that many times when she was alone, she would vehemently cry
out, as if some great hurt or violence had been offered to her, which was
indeed only the effects of her Melancholy.

3. When I had twice or thrice several times viewed her in some of these
passions, I conceived her not to be very far from Madness, so much had the
Melancholy humor prevailed: nor, as it was, could I call those fits any thing
but a Melancholy Madness; and considering this her constitution, her chief
Disease the Incubus was so much the more insupportable to her, for that she
could not be driven out of the opinion, but that it was a Spirit which haunted
her.

4. Her friends requested my help: her age and strength of body gave me hopes
of cure, and her ready compliance to any thing that could be don for her, made
it so much the more easy; first I universally purged her body by a very good
Panchymagogue, viz. my Family Pills with Aloes, which I repeated six or eight
times and in a pretty lage dose, so as that each dose of Pills gave her twelve
or fourteen stools: but by reason her Stomach was foul, the first two or three
doses, gave her one or two vomits, afterwatds her Stomach being well cleansed
they only wrought downwards: she took them every 4 or 5 day: and in the
intermediate days of taking them I caused her constantly to take Morning Noon,
and Night, about half an hour before meals twenty five or thirty drops of
Elixir proprietatis in a glass of White or Rhenish Wine: and upon the new of
the Moon, I caused her to take a dose of Spiritus vitae aureus Rulandi, made of
Colocynthis, infused in a small Cinnamon water: by this means the habit of her
Body was somewhat altered, and her Terms were made to flow plentifully, whereby,
she confessed she found herself much better.

5. By the use of these Medicaments her Incubus was much abated, but had not
totally left her; I caused her Head to be purged with this Errhine: Take new
Rhenish Wine, half a pint: juice of Sow-bread, half an ounce: Euphorbium in
powder ten grains: mix and dissolve the Euphorbium in the Wine. Some small
quantity of this was put up her Nostrills Morning and Night for four or five
days, by which her Head was plentifully purged, she evacuating by her Nostrills
a very large quantity of filthy matter, and by the removal of which she thought
herself to be perfectly cured: now the reason which in part induced me to this
way of the cure, was a great stoppage which I perceived to be in her Head, for
that she always breathed through the Mouth, and seemed as if she spoke in the
Nose.

6. But that we might not only take away the near or conjunct cause, but also
so strengthen the vital Faculties, that the Disease might no more return, we
thought it necessary to come to the exhibition of specificks, which comfort and
corroborate the Brain, and all the principal parts: for which purpose I caused
her to take for a month together every Morning fasting of this following
mixture: Take choice Cinnamon Water, spirit of Saffron, of each ten ounces:
Damask-Rose-water, eight ounces: syrup of Citron peels, six ounces: mix for a
juleb to be taken three or four spoonfulls at a time.

7. At Noon, about half an hour before Dinner, I prescribed this: Take Bawm
water compound, eight ounces: spirit of Lavender, five ounces:
Damask-Rose-water, syrup of Limon peels, of each four ounces: pure Tincture of
Tartar, two ounces: Powers of Musk, half an ounce: mix them: she took a
spoonful or two of it at a time, alone by it self, and, she confessed she found
it to strengthen both her Stomach and Head very much.

8. Lastly, at Night going to Bed; I ordered her to take of the following
Electuary the quantity of a large Nutmeg, drinking after it a glass of generous
Canary, or choice Rhenish wine a little sweetened, and to continue the same for
a month, as aforesaid: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, four ounces: volatile Salts
of Man's skull and of Amber, Musk in fine powder, of each half an ounce: Powers
of Oranges, Limons, and Rosemary, of each two drams: Extracts of Saffron, of
Contrayerva, and of Virginian Snake-root, of each one ounce: mix and make an
Electuary, she constantly took these things according to my order for about
five weeks together, at the end of which time she found her self to be
perfectly well: nor had she ever any more fits of the Nightmare, so far as I
know: for above four years after this Cure was performed she continued in
perfect health.

VII. The Incubus or Nightmare in a young Man.

1. The Youth made great Complaints of this Grief, in so much that many times
he would be afraid of going to bed, so vehement and terrible has been the
Paroxysms to him: also he greatly complained of the stoppage of his Breath, and
that, by reason thereof, he feared he should be suddenly carried off; so much
the terror of choking seized him.

2. And so much was the Youth possessed with the fancy of his Disease, that it
would seize him both sleeping and waking; in the time of the Fit, he would
intollerably groan, and when the Fit was off him, he would say, That something
lay upon him and pressed him, and that it was some Witch or Devil that thus
continually afflicted and persued him, in so much that he not only presuaded
himself that he has felt it, when it invaded him, but that he has also seen it,
and done his endeavor to strike it; and that sometimes he has thought with
himself, that he has flung it off from the bed, and he has heard it fall upon
the Ground.

3. So greatly was the Mind of the Youth possessed herewith, that he believed
it constantly had the impudence to come when he was awake, that he has seen it
come in the likeness of a Cat, sometimes of a Dog, and sometimes of another
Creature, but oftentimes in the shape of an old Woman which he had some
suspicion of, and believed did practice against him, and although that he thus
saw it come, and was thus sensible of it, yet that he was always so charmed and
taken therewith, by a kind of Enchantment, as he thought, that he could no ways
resist it: but that it took him, after the manner of some unconquerable and
uncontrollable power.

4. By reason of his continual Affliction, and the Youths manifold Complaints,
his Parents were forced at length to send for a Physician, who upon sight of
him, declared that the cause of his Distemper was from a disaffection of the
greater mesaraick Veins, every where about the Heart and Bowels, in which by
reason of the many Excrements of the first concoction, impure Blood was
generated and collected, from whence such like Vapors arising, and stopping
about the Midriff, caused that kind of Suffocation, which is called the
Nightmare, Incubus, ^^nigalion, or Ephialtos, it invading rather in the Night,
from a collection of malign and melancholy Vapors, by the accession of mere
Crud ties or indigested matter, which being increased by the Food taken over
Night, would be moved and carried upwards, and so the more vehemently tormented
the Youth: whence between sleeping and waking, feeling these pressures, he
would either dream or fancy these aforesaid Actions of Witches, or Devils.

5. So that his Mind being thus extreanly affected therewith, he could by no
means be driven out of the persuasion: and though being raised, and set
upright, the Vapors would be discust, and the Paroxysm cease for the present;
yet lying down again, it would in a very short time return again, in so much
that he would have more than twenty Fits in a Nights time. The Physician
declared further, That the Vapors being discust the Paroxysm then ceased, but
the seeds of the Disease remaining, upon the collection or accession of new
Fuel, the Evil constantly would return, with the more impetuosity, thereby
threatening, and bringing along with it, more grievous accidents, which seizsing
upon the Brain, and at length contaminating it, or the animal Functions might
at last produce an Epilepsy, or else what might be worse, an Apoplexy.

6. The remote cause of which things, he conceived to be from an evil course of
Diet; a very long time continued, from which Crudities being heaped up in all
Parts, the Blood in its universal Mass became contaminated and loaded with a
melancholy Sufflatus or Wind, which upon the least motion or fermentation of
the Humors, being stirred up, forthwith excited these incubitous and nocturnal
Afflictions, with such vehemence and constancy to the sick.

7. These things being declared and considered of, the Cure was attempted, as
follows: first by reason his Body was extremely bound, this following Clyster
was exhibited. Take fat Broth, a pint: Oil of Roses, Infusion of Crocus
Metallorum, of each three ounces: mix them together to be exhibited warm: it
wrought very well and loosned his Body.

8. Three days after I gave him an ounce of Vinum Benedictum, which gave him
five or six Vomits, and three or four stools: this after five days I repeated
again, whereby a great quantity of filthy matter, almost as black as Ink came
away, and he confessed himself very much relieved.

9. But in the intermediate days (to strengthen and corroborate the Viscera) I
gave him this following Bolus. Take Extracts of Gentian, and of Saffron, of
each half a dram: Extract of Juniper Berries, a scruple: mix them; to be given
at Night going to bed, and the same dose to be repeated the next Morning: the
other four days it was only given at Night going to bed: this done,

10. Upon the tenth day from the first giving of the Vinum Benedictum, I gave
him the following Dose. Take our vegetable Extract, Extract of Black Hellebor,
of each a scruple: Rosen of Jallap, three grains: Oil of Angelica, three drops:
mix them for a Dose, this wrought well and evacuated the melancholy matter
almost to a Miracle; so that our Patient began apparently to grow well, however
the same was three times repeated, but each at seven days distance.

11. In the Intervals of purging the following specific Powder was Morning and
Night exhibited to half a dram or two scruples, by the virtue of which the Cure
was completed. Take Peacocks-Dung, Salt of Hartshorn, of each two drams: Salt
of Mans-^kull, Powder of Vipers, volatile Salt of Amber, Musk, of each one
dram: Terra sigillata, three drams: make all into a fine Powder and mix them:
having taken this Powder for a while, he confessed he found every day a contineal
change and alteration of his Disease, and that so sensibly as that the sick
himself of his own accord would take special notice thereof.

12. Lastly having done all things as abovesaid, I ordered him to take the
Extract of Gentian half a dram, at Night going to bed, and to be continued
without Intermission for a Month, by the assiduous use of which (and the former
Method) the sick became perfectly well, so that his Disease returned no more.

VIII. An Incubus or Nightmare in a married Woman from obstruction of her
Courses.

1. This Woman having a great and long obstruction of her Courses, complained
at first of vapors and fumes up into her Head, and had certain strange fits
befell her, but appeared not to be Hysterical, at last they seemed to terminate
in an Incubus, which did so extremely afflict her, that she grew weary of her
life.

2. Many Physicians were consulted, who indeed pierced not into the cause of
her disaffection: and in order to her cure they first let her Blood, which was
repeated six times, and Blood was taken from her to the quantity of eighty or
ninety ounces; and her Doctors ordered her this following Julep, exactly as it
is taken off from the Apothecaries file: Take Fumitory and Cowslip-water, four
ounces: syrup of Violets, three ounces: Tinctura of Saffron, twelve drops, mix
them: of this she was to take four spoonfuls Morning and Night: and it was
repeated for twelve or fourteen days, but did her no good; then they prescribed
this: Take Plantane-water, Doctor Stephens his water, of each three ounces:
syrup of Clove-gilliflowers, one ounce and half: syrup of Betony, an ounce:
spirit of Earthworms, half an ounce: mix them. This was continued according to
order for about three weeks more, with several Baths, Fomentations, Anointings
etc. But all to no purpose.

3. At length they sent for me, and complaining of the ill success of the
former Doctors; withal told me, of a perpetual Sckness of her Stomach,
vomiting, and swelling of her Belly, with strange vapors, and fancies filling
her Head at certain times, with a long and tedious stoppage of her Courses,
upon which complaint we adhibited the following things.

4. In the first place, I gave her a vomit with my vomiting L^zenges, (the
preparation of which you will hereafter have in my Chemistry) which wrought
admirably with her, gave her five lusty vomits, and six or seven stools, by
which she found great relief: but I fearing her Stomach not to be sufficiently
cleansed, repeated it again the third day following, which wrought again
admirably, and brought away yet a larger quantity of more filthy and evil
colored matter, upon which the Woman concluded herself well.

5. Her Courses being not yet produced, we thought it necessary to do somewhat
more, least her Disease should return again: for this cause sake, I ordered her
to purge every other day, with Angelick Pills of Grulingius; which she did,
taking about ten or twelve doses of the Pills: and in the intervalls of
purging, I also ordered her to take the Elixir proprietatis, thirty drops at a
time in Sack, Morning Noon and Night, half an hour or more before eating.

6. By observing this course her Terms were effectually provoked, and came down
plentifully, and this our so miserably afflicted Patient not only came to have
a good color in her Face, but also had a good Stomach, eat her Food well, and
digested it: moreover a pain which she complained of that she felt in her left
Side about the region of her Spleen left her, and she seemed to be restored to
her perfect health.

7. However to consummate the Cure, and to corroborate all the weakened Viscera,
I ordered her to take the following Electuary, Morning and Night going to bed,
and to drink after the same a glass of Rhenish Wine and Sugar; and so to repose
herself to rest: Take choice Venice Treacle, two ounces and half: Indian green
Ginger, Indian preserved Nutmegs, candied Citron peels, of each two ounces:
conserve of Rosemary flowers, Spicknard in fin^ powder, of each one ounce:
Extracts of Gentian, of Contrayerva, and Virginian Snake-roo^, of each half an
ounce: mix and beat them all well together, and keep them for use.

8. Of this Electuary she took the quantity of a large Nutmeg, Morning and
Night for about fifteen or sixteen days, and became thereupon perfectly well:
It not only strengthened the Stomach and other Viscera, but also brought down
her Terms in due order, and perfectly removed those ascending vapors, which
before so much afflicted her.

IX. An Incubus or Nightmare coming upon the healing up an old Ulcer.

1. A Man near forty years of age, having had an old Ulcer upon his left Leg,
which had run many years, had it cured or healed up, by a very skilful
Chyrurgion, upon which not long after he was afflicted with the Incubus. which
continually assaulted him every Night, so that he could scarcely take any rest,
all which he imputed to the too hasty healing-up of his Ulcer without due
Purgation.

2. Upon this he sought out to Physicians for Remedy, who gave him many Purges,
but all in vain: at length they concluded, that it arose from a certain kind of
Hypochondriack Melancholy, which seizing upon his Spirits wrought that
Indisposition: But the Man who was well enough in his wits, nor any thing out
of his Senses, was of another opinion, and therefore desired of them a more
mechanic remedy, which might operate upon his Body, not his Soul.

3. At length wearied out with his Doctors, he sent for me, to whom he made a
relation of his grief: I concluded it to be partly from the turning of the
humor, partly from an indisposition of the Stomach, because we see that an
Incubus seldom or never invades any one without a preternatural Distemper of
the Stomach: and in this our Patient, there was almost a continual disposition
to vomit, nor since the healing up of the aforementioned old Ulcer, could he
scarce ever eat any thing with a stomach, but was either afflicted with
loathing, sickness at Heart, or vomitings.

4. These symptoms being considred, I first evacuated the Stomach with
Asarabacca, by which he had about eight vomits; this don, I purged him well
with my Family Pills with Aloes: but notwithstanding all these things, his
Incubus could not be wholly taken away; but though not so violent, yet would
often return, so that his fears of the Disease was worse to him than the
Distemper it self: for this cause sake, I thought convenient to make him an
Issue in his Leg, that part of the matter or humor which used to flow out by
the Ulcer, might there have some evacuation; which being artificially
performed, this our sick Patient in a little time began to be brought to his
wonted health.

5. However after having sufficiently purged and vomited him, as aforesaid, by
the aforegoing things; I thought it necessary to give such proper specificks as
might sympathize with the parts afflicted, but be Antipathetical to the
Disease, of which kind are all Antepilepticks, Antapoplecticks and Aromatic
Cephalicks.

6. But the thing which was particularly given to this our Patient, was first
Electuarium ad Tabidos, which was constantly given him every Morning fasting,
to the quantity of a hasle nut at a time: at noon before eating he took twenty
drops of the spirit of Hartshorn, in a glass of Sack: and at Night going to
Bed he took this following Electuary: Take Zedoary, Bay Berries,
Winters-Cinnamon, of each (in fine powder,) one ounce: Nutmegs, Ginger, Radix
Serpentaria, Dittany of Creet, of each half an ounce: Saffron, Cochenele, fine
Bole, Terra sigillata, of each two drams: long Pepper, half a dram: all being
in fine powder, mix them, and add thereto thrice their weight of pure Virgin
Honey, and make an Electuary according to Art. Of this he took the quantity of
a small Chest-nut at a time.

7. Moreover, to the soles of his Feet there was applied a drawing Emplaster
made only of Venice Turpentine, Rosin and Bole-Armoniack in fine powder, which
being mixed were spread upon Leather and applied: by means of which, he said, he
felt the Vapors sensibly to be drawn from his Head (at least he thought so) by
which means with the other helps, he was perfectly restored to health.

X. The Incubus or Nightmare in a young Man.

1. A Man twenty five years of age, complaining of the Nightmare, and how he
was continually afflicted therewith, was thus cured by an old Woman: first she
vomitted him, by giving him plentifully Carduus-Posset, which she said she did
for clearing his Stomach.

2. Secondly, she drew a large Blister in the Nape of his Neck by applying a
Plaster of Cantharides: after which she repeated his Vomit with
Carduus-Posset-drink two seveal times more, for the more effectual and
substantial cleansing of his Stomach.

3. Thirdly, she purged him downwards by giving him Prunes stewed with Sena,
and some of the Syrup of the same, by which he was plentifully evacuated
downwards.

4. Fourthly, after all this, she gave him the Conserve of common Wormwood,
which he took the quantity of a Wall-nut at a time, Morning, Noon, and Night:
the two first times, a while before eating; but at Night, an hour after Supper,
and this he did for a Month together, by which he became perfectly well.

5. And by this very method I cured a young Virgin which was afflicted with
this Disease; and afterward a middle-aged Woman, who had been been many years
diseased therewith: moreover I cured a Man who confessed he had been seventeen
years troubled therewith, following exactly the same method without any
alteration: and not long since, by the same means, I cured a young Lady, who
had been vexed therewith for above half a year.

XI. The Incubus or Nightmare in a Woman whose Terms were obstructed.

1. This Creature being about eight and thirty years of age, and having been
long troubled with this Disease, caused as she conceived, from the Obstruction
of her Terms, and other Stop pages, I cured as follows.

2. First, I opened her Body with the following Clyster: Take fat Broths, a
pint: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, two ounces: Tincture of Colocynthis in
Spirit of Wine, Honey, of each one ounce: Oil, three ounces: mix them together,
and give the same warm; this was done in the Morning.

3. The next day I purged her with my Family-Pils with Aloes, which gave her
two Vomits and ten Stools; and I repeated the Dose four times more, giving the
same every third or forth day; and all this was done about fourteen days before
the time she expected them.

4. And in the intermediate days I gave her Rhenish Wine and Sugar: with some
drops of the Powers of Juniper Berries; and sometimes with the Powers of Savin,
by which also the Courses were in some measure provoked, in so much as about
the time that they used to flow, they came down plentifully.

5. But with all, at Night going to bed, she took a dram of this following
Powder: Take Bay Berries in fine Powder, Winters-Cinnamon, Borax, of each five
drams: Cinnamon, Cloves, of each four drams: Grains of Paradise,
Rosemary-Flowers, of each three drams: Zedoary, Ginger, Salt of Hartshorn, of
each two drams: black Pepper, one dram: fine Sugar, three ounces: the Species
being in fine Powder mix them with the Sugar to be given as aforesaid.

6. Her Courses being produced and made to flow very well and naturally, she
became much better; however I ordered her to take the specific things
following: first every Morning I caused her to bath her Head, Temples,
Forehead, Nostrils, as also the Region of the Heart and Spleen with the Queen
of Hungaries-Water, which she did for ten or twelve days together: and
presently after to take of the Powers of Rosemary, Rue, Sage, Lavender, and
Angelica (all equally mixed) in a Glass of pure Rhenish-Wine and Sugar.

7. An hour before Dinner she took about the quantity of a Hazel-nut of this
following Electuary: Take choice Venice-Treacle, four ounces: Salt of Amber,
one ounce: Ens Veneris, Salt of Hartshorn, of each three drams: Extracts of
Saffron, and of Gentian, of each two drams: mix them to be given as aforesaid,
having first fermented four and twenty hours together: For the Salts will put
the Electuary into a new Fermentation.

8. At Night going to bed, she took this: Take Spirit of Angelica the greater
Composition, four ounces: Powers of Juniper Berries, half an ounce: Oil of
Cinnamon, half a dram: mix them: Dose a spoonful in a Glass of Sack, last at
going to bed: these three things in this order she continued the use of for a
Month.

9. Lastly, In the day time, in all her drink as she had occasion for it, I
prescribed some drops of Oil of Sulphur, to be taken; so many at a time, as
might give it a grateful acidity: By her exactly following of these Directions
all her obstructions were removed, her Courses made to flow orderly, and she at
length perfectly freed from her Disease, so as she never had it more.

XII. An Incubus in a middle-aged Man, accompanied with a vehement Catarrh.

1. This Man (about forty years of age) having been afflicted with these
Distempers for near a years space, and having forborne the taking of any Remedy
for some time, out of hopes, that Nature would vanquish his Disease; when he
saw he prolonged the time in vain, and that the longer he went, the worse he
was, at length he committed himself to the hand of a Physician, a learned
Graduate, and one of, etc. who promised to cure him: he purged him, vomitted
him, caused him to be blooded six or seven times to the loss of more than an
hundred ounces of Blood, so that the poor Man was brought to a very low estate,
and yet as far from Cure as he was at first; for besides his nightly trouble of
the Incubus, his Catarrh was much more and vehement, so extreme indeed, that he
thought it alone would carry him off, his Catarrh was so far from being made
better, that it was much increased, his strength was mightily impaired, his
Stomach (which ought to be the Index of Health) much weakened, and there was
also now added to the former Symptoms another or two vehement ones, to wit, a
violent Cough, with a shortness of Breath and difficulty of breathing.

2. Upon these evil Successes of our Doctor, it was thought fit to call two
other famous and great Men into the Consultation, that if the Patient should
dye, the Discredit thereof should not make any great Reflections: But alas!
that which was not any particular Man's Credit, was no Man's; nor in great
Consultations of many Physicians, is any one in particular greatly concerned,
whether the Patient does well or no: If by chance the sick recovers (though it
was purely from the strength of Nature, not from the Vanity of the Physicians,
or their formal and inconsiderable Consultations) Oh, how a Consultation of
Doctors is magnifyed; though peradventure not any two of them agreed, and the
casting Voice, which gave the Recipe or Prescription, was only a singular
Oracle, whose great Name and Reputation were the alone things that made it
Orthodox; and might peradventure have done as much perse, if not more, than he
did in Conjunction: But if the sick dies (though from the male-Practice of the
careless Consulters) no Man is concerned, nor is the Reputation of any of them
hurt, for that he dyed by the hands of the learned, and was cast away by the
Authority of a consulary Oracle, in which no Man had so much as one grain of
Reputation to loose. Haec autem obiter.

3. Two others being added to the Consultation, it was thought fit either by
them all, or the greater, or the lesser part of them, to take away more Blood,
which was done at five times to the quantity (in all) of about seventy ounces
or more, by which the poor sick Man was made much weaker than before:
Purgations, Vomits, and other like things were again iterated, idem ad idem, to
the end of the Chapter, in so much that at last, he was given over as
uncurable; and one of the said Doctors had the Vanity (after all his fruitless
Labor) to say, that he would be bound to give any Man five hundred pounds that
could cure him. But how unwilling he would have been to have made good his
confident and vain glorious Promise, had he been after put to it, I cannot but
smile to think of: And how ill an Opinion he ought to have of himself when he
considers, the folly and falsehood of this his lying Oracle, and the weakness
and insufficiency of his own Judgment and Understanding in the Art of Physic,
which I leave to all the learned in our Profession to determine.

4. Being thus deserted in this wretched condition by the learned Tribe, he for
a season gave himself over to Despair: at length some Friend commending me to
him, he requested my Advise: his condition was truly deplorable, but according
to the vulgar Proverb, whilst there is Life there is Hope; and being persuaded
to do my endeavor, I prescribed to him the following method, by which he was
perfectly restored to his former Health: first, for his Cough and shortness of
Breath, etc. I prescribed the dulcifyed Spirit of Sulphur, to be taken in all
his drink, as often as he drank: Take Spirit of Wine, a quart: Oil of Sulphur
or Vitriol, six ounces: put it in by drops; digest two or three Months, and
draw it off in a Glass Retort, with a very gentle Fire, so that a thick Magma
may be left behind: this he took sometimes in Ale, sometimes in Canary, and
sometimes in other Wine.

5. Every Morning fasting, he took this Composition: Take Spirit of
Earthworms, Spirit of Vipers, Spirit of Angelica the greater Composition,
Spiritus Vitae Matthioli, of each four ounces: choice Cinnamon Water, eight
ounces: mix and dulcify it with Syrup of Damask-rose-water: Dose two spoonfuls
every Morning fasting.

6. An hour before Dinner I ordered him to take the quantity of a large
Wall-nut of this following: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, three ounces: Salt of
Mans-skull, Salt of Amber, of each half an ounce: Indian green Ginger, one
ounce: mix and make an Electuary to be taken in the quantity aforesaid.

7. Lastly, at Night going to bed I prescribed my Laudanum to be given
constantly for some Months beginning with two grains, and to increase a grain
every Week, which he did, till the Dose came to twelve or fourteen grains:
these were all the things I gave him; by the assiduous use of which, in little
more than three Months time he became well in all Respects.

Observations from other Authors.
XIII. The Nightmare in a young Man.

1. A certain noble Person about the thirtieth year of his age, did complain
that whilst he was awake, he was as it were often oppressed with a great
Weight, and that he could not but with great difficulty either move or breath;
his Voice was uncertain, small, and scarcely discernable; this Disease is
called in Latin Incubus, in Greek (...) or (...). I helped him presently with
the following things.

2. Take Aqua Benedicta, two ounces: by drinking this he did vomit up many
Crudities, Choler, and Phlegm, and He said, he immediately found himself better;
his Body being well purged, I caused Blood to be taken plentifully out of the
middle Vein.

3. His Meat was sparingly given; and Hysop-Wine was given; he never lay on his
Back, but on his side according to my Direction, and he was presently well.
Mar. Rulandus, Cent. 9. Cur. 67.

XIV. The Nightmare.

1. There was a certain Person, who though he was well all day, yet at Night
when he would take his Repose and sleep, this Disease seized him; he asked my
Advice.

2. After an universal Evacuation by Panchymagogus Crollij, I ordered him to
make use of these Medicaments after eating, which repress all Vapors from the
Stomach; such are, a Confection of Anise, Coriander, Mastich, Frankincense,
Quinces, etc.

3. I also exhibited these things which strengthen both Head and Stomach: Take
the Species of Diarrhodon Abbatis, half a dram: Aromaticum Rosatum, Diambrae,
Diamoschi Dulcis, of each one scruple: white Sugar dissolved in the Water of
Betony, four ounces: the Oils of Amber, of Rosemary flowers, and Rosemary, of
each two drops: make Rowls according to Art. Grulingius, Cent. 1. Cur. 25.

XV. The Nightmare in one Melancholy.

1. An intimate Friend of mine, of his natural Constitution melancholy and sad,
said, that he felt in his Sleep a black Man lying upon him; and when he would
cry out, his Voice was stopped by the said Man, and was by him kept fast bound
every Night.

2. This Man came to me, I acquainted him with the Danger he was in, unless he
prevented it by seasonable and suitable Remedies: And that dreggy viscous humor
sticking about his Praecordia, and by its ugly Vapor possessing the Throat,
Midriff, Lungs, Brain, and all his Senses with Visions and horrible
Apparitions, were evacuated; and the bad quality thereof abated with Cordials:
I feared he would fall into a worse Disease.

3. He smiling jeered me, saying, I do not care a button for all your
purgation; I flight and scorn them; For this is not a mere fancy and toy
wherewith I am troubled, and so left me.

4. Within two days after, his Brother comes at midnight to fetch me, in all
have, to this miserable Man; I found him lying in his Bed, pale, cold,
speechless, scarce opening his Eyes when he was loudly called upon, he was also
forgetful, stupid and drowsy; I laid my Hand on the left side of his Chest, and
felt a very strong palpitation of his Heart.

5. Having seen all this; I provided Remedies, I applied Cupping-glasses, but
he being taken with a rattling in his Throat, dyed in a quarter of an hour
after, like one that had been planet stricken.

6. Let us not then make light of the Nightmare, which is a forerunner of the
Apoplexy and other grievous Diseases; Avicen, says, it is the forerunner of
one of these three, the Apoplexy, the Epilepsy, or Madness.

7. I knew a Man that as soon as ever he was fallen asleep, imagined he saw
black Dogs lying upon his Breast, and violently oppressing his Heart; this Man
after sundry Remedies were tried, was at length cured by Stibium, which made
him void Melancholy upwards and downwards. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib. 1. Observe.
42.

XVI. Of the Nightmare in general.

1. It is a Disease of that nature, that one thinks himself oppressed with a
great weight and believes that something comes upon him; This Malady is
sometimes caused by Excess of Drinking, and continual Rawness of the Stomach,
from whence do ascend Vapors, gross and cold, filling the Ventricle of the
Brain, letting the Faculties of the Brain to be dispersed by the Sinews.

2. They that are afflicted with this Disease can scarcely move, are
astonished, and feel as it were a suffocation and strangling, and the holding
of something that does violently invade them: the Voice hereby is suppressed,
some have in that Juncture such idle Imaginations, that they believe, they hear
the thing that does oppress them; at the last, with trouble the Vapors being
attenuated and driven away and the passage of the Spirits being opened, the
sick was raised.

3. It is good to have this Disease at first eradicated: For if it continue it
brings the Apoplexy, the Epilepsy, or Madness.

4. Let his Diet be thin, his Drink be Wine mixed with Water, or rather Ale; he
must avoid after day-sleeping and sleeping immediately Meat; let his whole Diet
be such as is prescribed for them troubled with the Falling Sickness.

5. If the whole Body be full, you must begin with Blood-letting, and you must
cut the Cephalic Vein: But if ill juice be gathered for want of perfect
Digestion, then purge the Body by Purgations; and if Phlegm abound, you must
minister Preparatives to extenuate the Phlegm, and then purge it.

5. The Body being purged, you must apply outward Medicines, whereof you may
find Examples before, black Seeds of Piony does chiefly help them, you may give
them fifteen Seeds brayed with Water, and nourish the Head with Oil of Dill
made hot, and cover the Head with a Cap, when they go to bed.

7. Minister within the Body those things which strengthen the Head, as
Aromaticum Rosatum, Diamoschi Dulcis, Diamber, Dianihos, Plerisarconticon, and
such like. Barrows Method, Lib. 1. Cap. 26.

XVII. The Incubus in a young Person.

1. One aged twenty years, of Constitution, melancholy phlegmatic; and troubled
for the most part with horrid and frightful Sleeps, could scarcely breath, by a
pressure as he thought upon him, and he was so afflicted that he was in danger
of suffocation.

2. His Cure was effected by taking those Pills that are proper in the
Epilepsy; viz. Gum Ammoniacum, etc. and the medicated Wine with the Spirit of
Sal Armoniack.

3. Take the Roots of Angelica, Orrice, round Birth-wort, of each three drams:
the Leaves of Sage, Origanum, Marjorum, Pennyroyal, of each one handful; Sena,
an ounce: the Flowers of Lavender, Hypericon, of each one pugil, Agarick, three
drams: Juniper Berries, one ounce: Cubebs, Cardamoms, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, of each
one dram and half: Salt of Tartar, one dram: cut and bruise, then, sew them up
in a Bag, upon which pour four pints of Rhenish or French Wine, let him take of
this thrice a day, two ounces: adding in every Dose, of the Spirit of Sal
Armoniack; ten drops.

4. Then take the next Confection. Take Conserves of the Flowers of Rosemary,
Sage, of each one ounce: Species Diambrae, Species Diamoschi Dulcis, of each
one dram: Mithridate, two drams: Oil of Amber, six drops: Spirit of Sal
Amoniack half a dram: Syrup of Staechas, a sufficient quantity: mix them and
make a Confection. This was taken every Evening after Supper to the bigness of
a Chestnut: Cooks Marrow of Physic. Chap. 3.

XVIII. Of the Nightmare in a middle aged Man.

1. A Man about forty years of age was well all day, and could exercise his
Reason and Senses, but when at Night he set himself to sleep, could not rest
quietly being troubled with the Nightmare.

2. He thought in his Sleep that he was choked and oppressed with some great
weight; in so much that he could scarcely breath or speak; his Senses being
also stupifyed; when he offered to stir or move, he felt great Heaviness and
Anxiety.

3. Rembertus Dodonaeus, in his Observations tells us of one who was so
grievously afflicted with this Malady, that when at Night he thought to rest
and sleep, he became instantly as one mad; shouting out, throwing his Arms and
Hands every where about him, sometimes he raised himself, then he leaped and ran
about the House; till the Bystanders hindered; when he was got into bed, then
he came to himself.

4. He was purged with proper Medicines and let blood, but these availed not
much, till a Cautery was made in his Neck for an Issue; which being for some
time kept open, the peccant humor came forth, and he grew better, and at length
he recovered his former Health.

5. This Patient of mine was ordered to observe a good Diet, and to forbear the
use of such Meats as were hurtful, after eating he was ordered to use Quinces
and Coriander corrected with Vinegar.

6. I commanded him to abstain from Wine, unless it was mixed with Water; but
he might drink Beer, provided it were not thick and flatulent, yet he may
rather drink Metheglin.

7. He may use Meats of an astringent Quality, such as Pears and Quinces; it
will not be good for him to drink unless at Meals, moreover I prescribed him to
mix with his Meats such things as are of an extenuating nature, as Hysop,
Marjoram, Thyme, Savory and the like.

8. Also he should continue in some lightsome place indifferently warm, let him
avoid long Sleeps and long waking, and too much and too long Labor; let his
Exercise be moderate, and let him use Friction, beginning at the
Shoulder-blades and Breast, then proceeding to the Legs and Feet; then lastly,
the Head; he must keep himself from the Cold and too much Heat, from Wind and
Smoke; pleasant, merry and witty Jests and such like are convenient.

9. When we had considered the strength of our Patient, as also the plenty of
Blood, we ordered the opening of the Cephalic or middle Vein in his Arm, and
to take from him about six ounces of Blood; which I thought was enough; in
regard there should be place left for purging the humor.

10. First of all extenuating things being exhibited for preparing the humors;
which being done; I ordered him to be purged, the phlegmatic humor abounding;
with the stomatical Pills, or Hiera Galeni simple or with Agarick and that
after Purgation such things should be administered as strengthen both Stomach
and Head.

11. Take the Species Diarrhodon Abbatis, Aromaticum Rosatum, Diambrae,
Diamoschi Dulcis, of each one scruple: dissolve them in the water of Betony,
there being added two ounces of white Sugar, make a Confection in tables, Dose
two or three drams twice in a day.

12. Moreover I commanded that the Phlegm should be drawn from the Head by
Gargarisms, Apophlegmatisms and Errhins; then afterward at turns that Treacle
and Mithridate should be exhibited, as also the Experiment of A^tius, then of
Paulus; which is fifteen grains of the Fruit of black Peony bruised in Water
for a draught, and that should be continued till the sick recovered. Petrus
Forestus, Lib. 10. Obser. 50

XIX. The Nightmare in a Child.

1. When I was a Child I thought my self oppressed as it were with a black Dog;
Theodorus Bizantius is of opinion, that those nocturnal Apparitions never yet
appeared to w^se and strong Men, but to such as are Children, Women, effeminate
Persons, mad Men and sickly People, who are because of the weakness both of the
Mind and of the Body, racked with daily Fear, vain and idle Dreams.

2. There are some Children who waking with a Fright; leap out of the bed: such
kind of Fears, according to Hippocrates and Galen, proceed from the gluttonous
and ravenous sucking of Milk, or from bad Nutriment; or Indigestion: But we
have observed that not only in these, but those also who are of perfect Age
have had most frightful Imaginations in their Sleep; especially when many
vicious humors oppress the Stomach.

3. Some get this Disease by external causes, such as Cold, and the Beams of
the Moon; if Children be troubled with this Disease, it is not good that they
sleep with their Belly full: while they are eating, you may give them a little
Honey to lick; but Children that are subject to surfeiting by reason of great
feeding are to be cured by the same Medicines that are used in the Epilepsy.

4. Frictions in this case are to be used, Rose Water sprinkled in the Face, or
rather Wine; if it be from a cold cause, is good.

5. Rondeletius advises Clysters for discussing and evacuating Flatulencies; if
there be Repletion, cutting of a Vein is necessary; the Head is to be purged
and strengthened, then Topics are to be made use of; as we have prescribed in
the Vertigo, Cephalalgia, and Epilepsy. Petrus Forestus ex Scholiis, lib. 10.
Observe. 51.

XX. The Incubus or Nightmare in a Girl.

1. A Maid about nine years of age was suddenly taken in the night with somewhat
like a Fever; then afterward with the Contraction of the whole Belly and
Breast, her Eyes continuing open, she did not answer when a question was put to
her, yet she seemed to be in her right wits.

2. She was afflicted with a difficulty of breathing; a thick kind of Spirit
possessed her Heart and Praecordia, and as one oppressed with some great
Weight, she could not speak.

3. A venomous kind of Spirit coming from the Belly to the Praecordia, then to
the Breast and superior Parts, did afflict this poor Maid; in this sort of
Paraxysm she continued from nine to eleven of the Clock: afterward on the
third day she was troubled with the like Fit.

4. I coming to see her, and finding that she could not be raised up by
Frictions and other Medicines, I ordered a Clyster to be made for her of the
Powder of Hiera Picra, Sal Gem and Honey, which had a good Effect: For she was a
little eased from the Paroxysm; yet she continued weak.

5. Then we did exhi^it a little Wine with the Raspings of the true Unicorn,
and so thereby she slept the next day much better.

6. The Mother of this Maid thought her Daughter was troubled with Worms, and
therefore gave her Worm-seed, yet she could not void any Worms; her Daughter
now grew better; her Pulse which in the Paroxysm was weak, swift and small;
became equal in its Motions.

7. Now, that the Malady may not return again at its usual hour, I commanded
that the Maid should drink Beer wherein Pulp of Cassia was put, containing
therein the Powder of the Seeds of Peony; it was drained by Expression into the
Beer and then drank.

8. The next Night the Fit was more easy and favorable; because she refused to
take one dram of the Powder in its pure substance we included it in the Pulp;
which was put into six ounces of Beer, this maid continuing to drink always
Beer so ordered; she became at length perfectly freed from this troublesome
Disease. Petrus Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 52.

SCHOLIA. The THEORY of the INCUBUS or NIGHTMARE.
By the Author W. Salmon.
XXI. The Pathology of the Incubus; and first of the Notation thereof.

1. The Names: A Graecis (...), ab (...), hoc est, insiliendo Nomen habens:
Quidam and (...), Test Aureliano, hoc est, Aggressionem and Invasionem
nocturnam nominant: ab aliis (...), and (...), Dioscorides (...), a Species
Suffocationis, quae hoc malo laborantibus in Somno offertur: Avicenna sua
lingua Strangulatorem nominat. In Latin it is called Incubus, ab incubando: in
English the Hag, or Nightmare.

2. The Definition. Incubus ergo est respirationis offensio, and vocis
interceptio, corporisque oppressio, seu motus impedimentum, cum falso in sommio
ponderis thoraci incumbentis, a vapore crasso, posteriora potissimum cerebri
obstruente, ut spiritus animales ad liberam respirationem, and motum edendum
prodire nequeant. It is a Disease (arising from thick Vapors) chiefly
obstructing the hinder part of the Brain, by which the Flux of animal Spirits
being stopped, the respiration or breathing is hurt, the Voice intercepted, and
the Body so oppressed (as it were between sleeping and waking) with a weight
lying upon the Breast and holding fast the whole Man, that (notwithstanding all
his endeavors) the whole Faculty of moving seems for a Season to be abolished.

3. The Kinds or Differences. They are twofold, 1. The Disease is considered
as it happens to such as are young, or in old People, and in these it has been
either of short, or of long continuance. 2. It is either essential in the Head
and Brain, or is caused by Consent from the Stomach, Hippochonders, Testicles,
etc. all which may be discerned by their proper Indications.

XXII, The Signs of an Incubus or Nightmare.

1. The Paroxysm comes for the most part when the Patient is in a Slumber, or
between sleeping and waking, sometimes it invades him in one Part, sometimes in
another: in some begins at the Feet, and creeps up the Legs and Thighs by
degrees, till it seizes upon the Breast, and laying hold (as it were) of all the
Powers and Faculties of the whole Body, chains them: in some it begins at the
lower part of the Belly, and so ascending higher, immediately takes a seizure
of the whole Man.

2. In other Persons, and in those especially where it is essential in the
Head. It begins to their apprehensions in the Ears: with a great Noise, and
with a kind of Terror, Fear, Amazment, and so descending to the Breast where it
makes its usual Residence, seizes the Arms, all the extreme Parts, and
immediately the whole Man, wherein there seems to be a Suffocation, or at
least, the sick is in great fear and dread thereof, being so mightily oppressed
with an extreme Weight upon their Breast and Stomach, which also holds fast the
whole Body; that they cannot breath or but with great difficulty: and doubtless
where this oppression is long, it may be dangerous, and from this cause it is
that some dye suddenly in their Sleep, and some go to bed, and never arise, or
awake more, which is caused from a too long compression of the animal Spirits
and vital Spirits, whereby at length, there is a total Suffocation, and from
thence Death.

3. In the time of the Paroxysm, the sick endeavors to stir, move, and shake
off his Burden, and to strive with vehemence, but all in vain, for when the
Fit is off, and the Man is come to himself, he finds he is not moved a hairs
breadth from the Posture in which he was first seized; and yet he thought he
strugled strongly with what oppressed him, and cried out, when indeed he never
spoke so much as one word; but because of the great oppression about the Heart
and Midriff, and fear of Suffocation, he commonly groans, and thereby expresses
the weight of his Affliction.

4. In some Persons the Disease first seises them in their Hands and Arms, and
creeping up by degrees, (as before, where it began in the Feet) is suddenly
seises the whole Body, but making it residence upon the Thorax and Parts
adjacent thereto, it compresses all the Spirits, endeavoring a Suffocation.

5. Although the Disease in the Paroxysm, so strongly seises the universal Man,
as to abolish all manner of external Motion, yet it little hurts the
Understanding, and internal Senses, nor the common Sense of Feeling: for if any
one being by, do but touch or pull them (though in the height of the Paroxysm)
the Patient immediately comes to himself, and can perfectly remember and tell
you all the Circumstances of his Affliction.

6. As from the great oppression, the sick groans, so also are the inward
Senses in many so disturbed, as that they believe, that it was a Spirit that
held them. Or that they are hagridden, (whence the Name:) or that some Witch or
Devil, sometimes in one Shape, sometimes in another, as of a Dog, Cat, Bear,
Lion, etc. lies upon them and oppresses them, and that they fight and and
strive with them, and will positively tell you, (and they also believe it) that
they struck the Devil or Witch a notable Blow, when indeed and in truth, they
never stirred their Hands or Arms (as aforesaid) an hair from their places.

7. It differs from the Epilepsy in this; for as that is always attended with
convulsive Motions, so this is always free from them, being only accompanied
with impotency of Motion: and as the Epilepsy is caused from a sharp matter
stimulating the menings of the Brain: so this is thought to be caused from some
gross Vapors obstructing the Passages of the Brain. It differs also from an
Apoplexy, in this; for that Disease is accompanied with the abolition of all
manner of Sense and Motion; this only with an hurt of Motion, the internal
Senses still remaining, though sometimes a little obfuscated or clouded.

XXIII. The cause of the Incubus or Nightmare.

1. Fernelius, and some others of his stamp, will have the cause of the Incubus
to be from thick phlegm and Melancholy, not in or afflicting the Brain, but
adhering to the Praecordia, or compressing the Diaphragma, and tumifying or
extending the Lungs, arising from Surfeiting, Drunkenness, Gluttony, and crude
or indigested humors filling those parts, from whence gross vapors arising,
seize upon the fauces and Brain whereby is caused a suppression of the voice,
and a troubling, obfuscating, or clouding of the other senses, whereby (as in
chains) the Patient is held so fast, that he cannot stir or move the least part
about him.

2. This I confess seems plausible at first sight, if those passages out of the
Stomach and other Viscera were plainly proved to be straight or immediate, that
so those affrighting exhalations might have a ready passage to the Cortex of
the Brain; but till these things are more plainly demonstrated by the Authors
of this doctrine, we desire a suspension of our assent thereto; and that they
would be pleased to answer us to these following Objections. First, whether
Surfeiting, Gluttony, Drunkenness, etc. be the remote or proximate causes of
this evil: if the remote, how comes it that upon the immediate prevarication,
the Patient is seized with a Paroxysm? if the Proximate, how is it, that all
persons (or the greatest number of them) abusings themselves in that kind, are
not forthwith taken with this Distemper, for that we see the generallity of
Mankind, thus prevaricating to be absolutely free therefrom, yea though the
most Debauched or Luxurious? Secondly, How comes it to pass that many time the
most abstemious and selfdenying persons (where those pretended causes can be no
ways previous) should (after an extreme manner) be molested herewith; and the
most temperate persons be so afflicted, as to be brought thereby into despair,
or involved into some more dangerou Disease? Thirdly, Why every adherescencie
to the Praecordia, or compression of the Diaphragma should not cause the same
thing, and that in every person so afflicted? but the contrary hereof is
evidently manifest by quotidian Experience, and that the persons so oppressed
are for the most part taken with some other Disease? Fourthly, Why one should
not rather be troubled with this Disease (if the former doctrine be true) after
the eating of things windy, and such things as are apt to generate vapors and
exhalations, as Onions, Leeks, Garlic, Cresses, Rocket, Mustard, etc. than
after the eating of things either insipid in their own nature, Or which are of
a constringing and binding quality, being rather of a fixed than volatile
property?

3. But we are not singular in this judgment, for the most learned Sennertus,
seems to descent something therefrom: his words are these, Et si vero quandoque
istam Thoracis oppressionem hoc modo fieri posse non negamus; tamen ea non est
praecipua caussa, nec semper a Cruditate and Crapula, verum etiam, sine his,
and alijs caussis fieri potest. And he gives you the near or conjunct cause, in
these words: Caussa proxima est obstructio meaturum Cerebri, qui ad initium
Spinalis medullae tendunt; and Spiritus animales organis Sensus ac motus
deferunt, a vapore crasso: which doubtless is not far distant from truth.

4. We affirm the Brain to be the principal part affected, together with the
Animal Spirits in the passages thereof; and that great oppression or weight
upon the Thorax or Breast, together with that fast holding of the Body whereby
it becomes immovable, is caused from a withdrawing or stoppage of the said
Animal Spirits, which is the fountain or prime cause of the motive faculty, as
also the near or conjoined cause, by which the instruments of motion perform
their operations, by the guidance of the sensitive soul; which being by some
accident, obstructed in its passages, or as it were cut off, for a small
moment, all motion (for so long time) ceases through the whole Body: And
although the Man strives never so much to stir or move himself, it is all in
vain, for as much as the Animal spirit which gives being and life to the motive
faculty is for a season cut off, and its flux hindered; and the suppression of
the Voice is from the same cause, viz. From that which abolishes the motive
faculty.

5. Now by reason of the short continuance of the Paroxysm, the Disease seems
not to be dangerous; but should it continue long, a suffocation of the Vital
flame should certainly ensue; for the Animal Spirit being the Breath or Air, by
which the Vital Spirit is nourished and kept alive; should that be but for a
little while withdrawn or cut off, the said vital flame in a short time after
becomes extinct: and truly (in my opinion) a long Paroxysm of the Incubus is
the cause for the most part of sudden Death in sleeping, and that many that go
to Bed and fall a sleep, and awake no more, dye by force of this Disease, being
suffocated, and not of an Apoplexy, as some have formerly believed. And whether
this be admitted or no, that the Vital Spirit is nourished and kept alive by
the Animal Spirit, yet the suffocation of the Vital might be caused also in
part, by other means, viz. From the want of inbreathed Air, which must
infailably cease, if the motive faculty be totally abolished in the whole Body.

6. Hence it appears that in some the prime, antecedent, or remote cause of the
Incubus may be from the irregularity of using the six Non-naturalls, which
according to the opinion of Rhases and Avicenna is lodged in the Blood, that
being corrupted through those irregularities: Sennertus, thinks it to be from
the hurt of the digestive faculty, but chiefly from a cold intemperature of the
Head or Stomach: But truly the Procatartick cause is either from error in Diet
long used, or a melancholy habit of the mind whereby the Blood becomes
excrementitious, and filled with crude vapors.

7. The Proegumiuine, nere or conjunct cause of this Disease, is from vapors
immediately filling the passages of the Brain, or Avenues of the Animal Spirit,
chiefly about the beginning of the Spina Medulla, by cutting off of its flux,
whereby the functions of natural and voluntary motion are immediately impeded,
and the whole Man and every part of him bound (as it were) in Chains. And this
for the most part comes to pass in such (where there has been a long antecedent
cause) who eat and and drink such things as immediately put the Blood and other
natural juyces upon a gentle fermentation, from whence vapors are generated,
which in the passages of the Brain, fail not to effect those things before
mentioned. Now what these things are in particular, which in every
constitution, will excite such a fermentation is not easy to determine: for in
some persons one thing does it: in other persons another. Some if they eat but
an Onion or Leek, are certain the next night to be troubled with it: Others if
they should eat an hundred, would never be hurt thereby. Some again, if they
eat but a red Hering, would after it be afflicted above measure; others can
make them their daily Food without prejudice: but these things are to be known
particularly from Observation and experience; and accordingly such as are
subject to this Disease, should make it their business to avoid the same.

8. Moreover the Paroxysm is promoted, partly from the position of the Body (in
those who are subject to this Disease:) for it commonly seizes them lying upon
their Backs; seldom when they ly upon their Bellies or Sides: and yet I knew
one, in whom the Disease had such a praevalency, that it would as farmiliarly
seize him lying on his Side as on his Back: as also when they are in a
slumbring condition, or between sleeping and waking at what time, and in which
condition, the matter is more easily moved to the hinder part of the Head or
Brain, and the beginning of the said spinal marrow.

XXIV. The Prognostics of the Incubus or Nightmare.

1. This Disease the more gentle it is, the less danger of degenerating, and
the more easy to be cured; the more grievous, the more difficult of cure.

2. It is more incident to Children and young people, than to elder; and is
more easily cured in the one than in the other.

3. The more constant and frequent the fits, the more perilous; and so much the
more dangerous if the sick remains in a stupid kind of condition after the fit
is gone.

4. If it comes from any external cause, or continued Surfeit, it is less
dangerous, because, the cause being removed, the effect will cease.

5. That which is essential in the Head is the most dangerous, if it is by
consent from others it is not of so evil a consequence; though in this latter
case, the cure is for the most part very long and tedious, nor does the Disease
vanish till the discrasie of the part causing be remedied.

6. If it happens in sleep it is less dangerous, than if it happens just at the
awaking; for this latter is nearer to an Epilepsy, into which, this Disease
does oftentimes degenerate: moreover it is the more dangerous if the Paroxysm
be accompanied with a cold Sweat or trembling of the Heart, or if either of
them, or both of them, or a Convulsion, or Swooning, immediately follow upon
the going off of the fit.

7. If the Disease be of long standing and frequent, and proceed purely from a
Distemper of the Brain, especially in elder people, it presages the falling
sickness; or the Apoplexy.

8. Fat Children, and young people having fat Bodies, are many times suffocated
therewith; because in such, the matter cutting off the flux of the Spirit, is
so thick and plentiful, that nature can never dissipate it.

XXV. The Therapia, or method of curing the Incubus or Night Mare.

1. The indications of the cure of this Disease are threefold: First, the humor
or matter cutting off the flux of the Animal Spirits is to be removed, which is
don by proper evacuations: Secondly, the Discrasie of the Blood is to be
rectified, and to be reduced to its prestine state of Health: Thirdly, to
strengthen the parts afflicted and weakened by force of the Morbifick matter.
And indeed the same order and method, and the same medicaments which are used
in the cure of the Falling Sickness may be used here, though truly things less
in power and virtue may in this case serve the turn.

2. The first Indication requires evacuation of the morbifick matter, and this
is either general or particular.

3. The general evacuation is done by such Medicaments as by a Catholic
property purge the whole body universally, of which kind are all Hologogues and
Panchymagogues, which take away the Cacochymy either by vomit or stool.

4. Emeticks proper in this case are the Gilla Theophrasti, vinum Benedictum,
or the Infusion of Crocus Metalorum, the first of which you may give from a
scruple to four in Broth or Posset Drink: and either of the latter from three
drams to an ounce or ten drams, according to age and strength; which will work
well: Or you may exhibit from three to five grains of Mynsicht his Emetick
Tartar, which here is inferior to no other Medicament: and to Children, Our
vomiting Lozenges, which are pleasant, and work most effectually to the
intention: to strong and rustic bodies you may exhibit two or three grains of
the Vitrum Antimonij, in a little Conserve of Roses or of Barberries, or in
some other vehicle as the Patient likes: these things you may give if you find
the Stomach to be afflicted, or the remote cause to be Gluttony, Drunkenness,
Surfeiting etc. wherein it is fit that the matter should be evacuated by
vomiting, for without an effectual cleansing of the Stomach, no success in the
cure can be expected.

5. Catharticks proper here, are Pil. Rudii, Pil. Rufi, Aggregativae, Cochiae
maj. and min. Our Family Pills which are inferior to none of them, our
Royal-Pouder, or Pil. Panchimagogae vegitab. which works gently and pleasantly:
all of which may be given from twelve grains to four and twenty: but you ought
to beware that the Body be not bound, least evil Symptoms succeed: if so, you
must provoke Stools by a Clyster, as shall be directed in the following
Paragraph. Moreover, we commend our Catharticum Argenteum, as a Specific
against this Disease, and most other the Diseases of the Head, for that it
evacuates powerfully the morbifick matter, and may be given from two scruples
to two drams, according to the age and strength of the Patient, with due
Government of the Body during its operation. Platerus commends this: Take
Species Hiera Galeni, half a dram: Aggregative, one scruple: with Syrup of
Staechas make Pills. Or this, Take Liquorish, half an ounce: Raisons, one
ounce: Aniseeds, two drams and half: Cordial-Flowers, one pugil: Epithymum,
Sena, of each half an ounce: boil them, and add to the straining Rhubarb, one
dram: Bark of black Hellebor prepared, half a dram: (if the Patient be strong
you may increase the quantity of the Sena) Ginger, Grains of Paradise, of each
half a scruple: strain it, and give it, with half an ounce of Syrup of Roses.
Or you may give other Potions with Diasena, or Pil. Cochiae; evacuating at
diverse times the matter offending. Or this: Take Species Hierae-Archigenis,
one dram: black Hellebor prepared, one scruple: Agarick, Rhubarb, of each half
a dram: Epithymum, a scruple: Peony-seeds and roots, of each half a dram: with
Honey of Squills make a Mass: Dose from a scruple to two scruples as strength
will bear it, and let them be given fasting before Dinner, or Supper.

6. But if the Body be bound as aforementioned, 'twill be necessary to give a
Clyster to open the same, that the Cathartick Medicament may operate the more
pleasently and safely: for this purpose you may use this: Take Diacatholicon,
six drams: Diasena solutive, one dram: Oil of Cammomil, three ounces: fat
Mutton-broath, a pint: mix them, strain, and exhibit it warm. Or this: Take
Decoctum commune, a pint: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, Virgin-Honey, Oil of
Roses, of each an ounce: mix them for a Clyster; to be given warm, as
aforesaid. If the Body abounds with Wind, you may make it thus: Take a strong
decoction of Juniper Berries, a pint: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, three
ounces: Honey, two ounces: which let be first well mixed with Oil of Aniseeds,
ten drops: and then added to the other things and so exhibit it warm.

7. The Body and Head having been thus generally cleansed by an orderly and
methodical administration of the former things, we may now come to particular
Evacuations, whereby the Excrements of the Head may be purged away by Errhines,
Sternutatories, Gargarisms, Masticatories, etc. all which (as well as the
former Evacuations) are often to be repeated, by Intervals, maxim (says
Sennertus) cum metus est, ne in alium affectum hoc malum transeat. But of these
kinds of operations we need not be particular or long in this place, having
shown Examples enough in some of the foregoing Chapters of the former Book, to
which I shall referr you.

8. The Second Indication is to amend the Discrasy of the Blood, which is done
by such things as take away its evil quality: and this is done chiefly by the
exhibition of volatile things, such are the Powers and Salt of Hartshorn,
Powers and Salt of Vipers, Powers and Salt of Mans-skull, with other things of
like nature: Take Conserve of Roman-Worm-wood, two drams: volatile Salt of
Peacocks-Dung, ten grains: mix them for a Dose to be given at Night going to
bed. Or this: Take Conserve of Rosemary-Flowers, two drams: Salt of Mag-Pies,
choice Musk, of each fourteen grains: mix and make a Bolus to be given at
bedtime. Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, half a dram: volaetile Salt of Swallows,
a scruple: Musk, ten grains: mix them for a Dose. Or thus: Take Electuarium ad
Tabidos, half a dram: volatile Sal Armoniack, Salt of Hartshorn, and volatile
Salt of Amber, of each six grains: Oil of Rosemary, two drops: mix them for a
Dose: Or thus: Take Mithridate or Venice Treacle, a dram: Salt of Vipers, or of
Mans-skull, five grains: volatile Salt of Mag-pies, three grains: mix and make
a Bolus. There are many other things which are excellent against this Disease
but truly exceed not in Power and Virtue the Powers and volatile Salts of
Vipers and of Mans-skull, which admirably resist the Disease in the very
Essence thereof, and so perfectly rectify the Blood, as to free it from all
heterogene matters causing this Malady. And therefore the Powder of Vipers is
of excellent use for this same purpose; and being given to one dram, and the
Patient sweating upon, it expels the noxious humors by Sweating through the
pores of the Skin, and produces such a purity in the Blood (especially being
several times used) that it will not easily degenerate again. To these things
add the Tinctures of Coral and Amber.

9. The third and last Intention is vital, to wit, the confirmation and
strengthening of the Parts afflicted, which is done either by Internals or
Topics.

10. Internals ought to be Specificks to the Parts afflicted, and such are all
Cephalicks and Neuroticks, and indeed all such things as we have prescribed as
Specificks in the cure of the Epilepsy; but that we may not leave you in the
dark we shall give you some Examples: Take the Queen of Hungaria's Water, four
ounces: Syrup of Citrons, Angelica-water, of each two ounces: Powers of
Nutmegs, one dram: mix them: Dose half a spoonful or more every Morning. Or
thus: Take Spirit of Earthworms, Powers of Rosemary, of each two ounces:
Damask-Rose-Water, Syrup of Clove-gilly-Flowers, or of Citrons, of each an
ounce and half: Powers of Vipers, two drams: mix them for a Potion: Dose half a
dram, or more in a glass of Sack. Or thus: Take Spirit of Saffron, four ounces:
Spirit of Hartshorn, one ounce: Peony-Water, two ounces: Salt of Mans-skull,
one dram: mix them: Dose one spoonful every Morning in a glass of Sack.

11. To these things you may add Tinctures and Magisteries of Coral and Pearl,
as also of Amber, of Crab's-eyes and Crabs-Claws: Powers of Amber, Rue, Sage,
Cammomil, Cinnamon, and of Juniper Berries, all which things have an absolute
Power to corroborate the Parts: the Powder and Extracts of Peony, whether the
Roots, Seeds, or Flowers, the Powder of Misleto of the Oak. Take Mithridate or
Venice-Treacle, a dram: Powder of Peony-roots or of Misleto, half a dram: mix
them for a Dose to be taken at Night going to bed. Or thus: Take
Venice-Treacle, a dram: Extracts of Peony and of Misleto, of each half a dram:
mix them for a Dose, to be taken as aforsaid. Or thus: Take Conserve of Acorus,
three ounces: Powder of Misleto of the Oak, three drams: mix them: Dose six
drams at Night. Or thus: Take Aromaticum Rosatum, Extract of Gentian, Extracts
of Peony-roots, of each an ounce: Salt of Mans-skull, half an ounce: mix them:
Dose a dram to two drams. Or thus: Take Extracts of Gentian and of Saffron, of
each two ounces: choice Musk, half an ounce: Ambergrise, one dram: being in
fine Powder mix them: Dose half a dram to a dram and half.

12. Sennertus commends this: Take Species Aromaticum Rosatum, one dram:
Diarrhodon Abbatis, half a dram: Diamargariton frigidum, Cinnamon, Mace,
Cloves, of each one scruple: Misleto of the Oak, half a dram: Peony-seeds,
Magistery of Coral, of each one dram: Aniseeds, two drams: Coriander seeds,
half an ounce: Sugar of Roses tabulated, the weight of them all, mix and make a
Powder: Dose one spoonful. Or this: Take Coriander-seeds, half an ounce:
Aniseeeds, Fennel-seeds, Aromaticum Rosatum, of each half a dram: Peony-seeds
hul'd, red Coral prepared, of each two scruples: Sugar of Roses tabulated, the
weight of them all: mix and make a Powder. Or this Electuary: Take preserved
Quinces, an ounce and half: preserved Wall-nuts, number one: Citron-Peels
candied, half an ounce: Conserve of Roses, six drams: Flowers of Rosemary,
Lavender, and Marjoram, Roots of Scorzonera candied, of each half an ounce:
Powder of Peony roots and seeds, of each half a dram: red Coral prepared, one
dram: with Syrups of Citron-Peels, and of Quinces make an Electuary. Or this:
Take Aromaticum Rosatum, three drams: old Venice-Treacle, a dram and half:
Plerisarconticon, four scruples: Diamoschi Dulcis, Musk, of each one dram:
Conserve of Rosemary, and of Rosemary-Flowers, of Acorus, of each half an
ounce: Peony-seeds, a dram and half: Coriander seeds, one dram: with Syrup of
Staechas make an Electuary: Dose one dram after eating. Or thus: Take Powder of
Cloves, two drams: of Aniseed, of roots of Elecampane, and of Angelica, of each
a dram and half: Aromaticum Rosatum, two drams and half: Nutmeg, Cinnamon,
Musk, of each one dram: candied Orange-Peels, one ounce and half: with Syrup of
Epithymum, a sufficient quantity: make an Electuary.

13. Some other Physicians commend Worm-wood-Wine taken in a Morning fasting;
as also Lozenges of Aromaticum Rosatum, of Diarrhodon, or of Diamoschum, to be
taken at bedtime. Platerus advises to this Electuary: Take Conserves of Roses
of Borrage, and of Marjoram, of each an ounce and half: Citron-Peels,
Myrobalans, and Ginger candied, of each half an ounce: Elecampane, Galangal, of
each a dram and half: Peony-seeds, Coral, Ivory, of each two drams: Diarrhodon,
Dianthos, of each a dram: Cordial Species, half a dram: with Syrup of Betony
make an Electuary: Dose the quantity of a Chest-nut, drinking after it a little
Wine mixed with water of Lilly Convally.

14. Topics to be appyd in this Disease, are either proper Cephalicks and
Neuroticks, or Amulets.

15. Of Cephalicks and Neuroticks these following are chief. The powers of
Rosemary, of Rue, of Sage, of Sassafras, of Savin, of Amber, of Lavender, of
sweet Marjoram, of Hyssop, of Time, of Feather-few, of Tansie, of Baum, of
Mint, the Queen of Hungaries water, the Quintessence or Powers of Virtues; all,
or any of which, may be bathed Morning and Night, upon the Head, Temples,
Forehead, Nostrills, Breast, Stomach, and regions of the Liver and Spleen, as
also upon the Pulses in several parts: for thereby the Tone of the said parts
come to be strengthened, so as the generation of the morbifick matter will be
prevented. Moreover the crown of the Head may be shaved, and thereupon you may
apply the Emplaster of Franciscus Valesius, which we have so often celebrated
in the former Book against the Epilepsy.

16. Of Amulets against this D^sease, these are chiefly commended by Sennertus:
Peony roots hung about the Neck, Bracelets made of Peony seeds, red Coral,
Lapis Chrysolitus put into a golden Locket; as also Lapis Malachrites (which is
a kind of green stone, and I suppose nothing differing from the green Lapis
Nephriticus) which being enclosed in a golden L^cket, may be worn upon the left
Arm.

17. Hitherto of a simple Incubus essential in the Brain; a word or two now of
that which is by consent from other parts. In this case you must mix with the
Medicaments before proposed, such things as are most appropriate to that part,
from whose consent, the affliction may be thought to arise: so, if it be from
the Stomach, you ought to mix Stomaticks: if from the Liver, Hepaticks; if from
the Spleen, Spleeneticks; if from the Womb, Hystericks; if from the Reins,
Nephriticks, etc. That thereby the Medicaments designed, may be directed to the
intention: Now to know when it proceeds from a Sympathetick affection, or
Compassion (as I should rather speak it) of any other part, you ought to
consider the symptoms attending the same, and so accordingly to judge.

CHAP. II. Of a TREMBLING. The AUTHORS Observations.
I. A Trembling in a young Man from excessive drinking of Brandy.

1. A Young Man of about twenty eight years of age, having acquired a Trembling
of his extreme parts, through his much drinking of Brandy, and other strong
liquors, desired my help, it being extreme troublesome to him: And whereas, it
might have been thought, that he should have been very hot and inflamed, he on
the contrary acquired a pale countenance, and a very cold disposition of Body.

2. The reason of this thing being inquired into, was found to be from the weak
constitution of his Body; for as much as many that drink strong liquors in like
manner, are contrariwise of a fresh Rosy or red color, and continually hot as
if they were in a Fever. Now the heat in Man's Body arises from the praevalency
of the Spirit, for where that is strong and turgid, the Man is in a good heat,
or it may be it superabounds; but where it is Latent, or Languid and weak,
there the heat is diminished, and it may be much less than it ought to be.

3. Now the reason why in one Man it should be very much diminished; and in
another (from the same cause) it should be as much augmented about its natural
temperature, seems to me to be wholly from the strength of the natural
constitution, and in part from the rarity or density and straightness of the
Pores, in one more than in another; by means of which there is an occasion of a
greater wasting, or diminution of the Spirit in the one than in the other.

4. And this is clear in such as are in continual Fevers, who before they
sweat, are extremely red, and of a vehement burning heat: but if by accident or
art, they are made to sweat well, than the heat is not only abated and as it
were totally taken away, but also that unnatural redness vanishes, and leaves
in the place thereof a palish whitness. Now whereas such a great, red color
and vehement heat of Body was caused from the turgency of the Spirits in the
Blood, now in a vehement fermentation; so the loss of that color and heat was
by reason of the diminution and wasting of the said Spirit, in sweating, a
transpiration being made through the Pores of the Skin: and this is so much the
more evident, for that after such sweating, the sick (although his heat and
inflammation is but barely allayed, yet he) finds himself much weaker and
fainter, with a certain lowness of Spirit and Dullness.

5. And therefore it is, that in very strong constitutions, and in such who
have a greater density and straightness of the Pores than others, such upon
drinking Brandy and other strong liquors, have always a great redness and heat
upon them, as if they were in a Fever, because of their strength of Body and
apt disposition thereof, to retain the spirit and native heat, how much soever
stirred up: whereas on the contrary, the other through their natural weekness,
and laxity of the said Pores, are subject to a continual wasting of the Spirit,
and vast diminution of the said internal heat, whereby they are rendered, pale
in countenance, and extreme faint and feeble; and this was indeed the true case
of this our Patient.

6. This Tremor or Trembling, Riverius, lib. 1. cap. 10. calls voluntary motion
depraved, by which the member is sometimes elevated, sometimes depressed, through
the mutual contention between the faculty, and the part affected; this
definition may serve for this place; but he seems to fetch it out of Galen de
sympt. cause. lib. 2. cap. 1. who upon this subject does not wholly agree with
himself, but calls it in another place motion diminished, But Riverius says,
That the moving faculty desires to lift up the member, and to keep it in that
position, but the weight of the member presses it downwards, whence comes
(says he) the Trembling motion.

7. The Trembling in this our Patient being very great, and his weakness much,
I was unwilling to purge him, for fear of farther weakness: but I began the
cure with a prohibition of those things which were the Procatartick cause of
his Disease, and therefore I totally interdicted Brandy to him, yet withal
gave him liberty to drink for a season now and than a glass of generous Wine,
least if he was wholly debarred of all strong liquors at once, a faintness of
the Spirit, and general weakness more than ordinary should immediately seize
him: and therefore in this case, I endeavored to make a virtue of necessity;
and so caused him to take those things which I designed for his cure partly in
Wine, partly in Mead, whereby his restoration was rendered more facile and easy.

8. Now whereas the prime, first or remote cause proceeded from drunkenness,
(besides interdicting the superfluous drinking of strong liquors) so two things
seemed necessary in this cure. The first was to rectify and restore the the
Spirit, hurt and diminished in its operations: Secondly, to comfort and
strengthen the parts weakened through the Spirits aberration.

9. The first intention is performed by Internal Medicaments, chiefly such as
are of a volatile property and comfort the animal Spirit. And therefore I gave
him the following things: every Morning fasting he took the Spirit of
Hartshorn, or the Powers thereof to half a dram, in a glass of Wine or Mead;
and about an hour after the same he eat a hard Biscate for his Breakfast: he
increased the dose as he found occasion: after fourteen days was over, I
changed his Medicament, and gave him instead of the preparations of Hartshorn,
the volatile Salt of Man's skull, from twelve grains to sixteen in old Conserve
of Roses; the which he took every Morning for a month together in the same
manner.

10. An hour before Dinner, I prescribed him ten grains of volatile Salt of
Amber, to be taken in Conserve of Roses, as the former, and to drink after it,
if he so pleased a glass of Viper Wine: and this was also continued for six
weeks together.

11. About two hours after Supper, just at going to Bed, he took a dose of Our
Electuarium ad Tabidos the quantity of a large Nutmeg, and drank after it a
little glass of Mead; and so reposed himself to sleep: the which he continued
during the whole course of his Cure.

12. The second intention, which was to strengthen the Muscles, Nerves,
Tendons, and other parts weakened, was performed by outward application;
(although it is not to be doubted, but that the former internal Medicaments,
much contributed to the same intention: to perform which I caused him for eight
or ten days to be Morning and Night bathed first with the Powers Amber, or the
Powers of Man's skull: and then with the Tincture of Myrrh: and after ten days
he was only bathed Morning and Evening, as aforesaid, with the pure Tincture of
Myrrh made with the Spirit of Wine, for near a month more: by the use of this
means here prescribed, (and the enjoined abstinence) he was in about six or
seven weeks time restored to his pristin health.

II. A Tremor or Trembling in another Man, arising from Drunkenness with a
leprous Scab.

1. He being of a middle age, and of a heavy, fat and gross Body, filled with
many ill humors, I conceived it necessary first to make a gentle evacuation,
which I did by exhibiting of my Family Pills with Aloes, repeating the same six
times, at five d^ys distance between each Exhibition: and withal giving in the
intermediate days Elixir proprietatis, every Morning fasting, thirty drops at a
time, in a little glass of Canary, with all prohibiting him from the ordinary
or frequent use of strong liquors.

2. At Noon, as also between meals when he desired to drink, I ordered him to
take from six to ten, or twelve drops of Oil of Sulphur in all the liquor which
he drank, by the use of which his Stomach which had been much enervated and
weakened, became restored; and whereas, he was before afflicted much with a
Nauseousness and Vomiting, so that he could scarcely eat any food without
loathing, and many times vomited it up again, upon the use of these things the
nauseousness and vomiting left him: And he now began to eat his food with an
Apetite, and to digest it well.

3. But after the vomiting was stopped, within about eight or ten days after, a
strange breaking out came into his Face, Neck, and parts adjacent, being a kind
of Scab, not much unlike to a Leprosy, and it was of so rebellious a nature
that it resisted all remedies whatsoever we could apply to it outwardly, or
administer inwardly; so that having used things for about sixteen weeks and all
in vain; we were at length necessitated to another kind of cure.

4. The Man himself, as also several Physicians, and others, took it to be the
effects or relics of an old Surfeit; some thought it to be a true Leprosy,
from its rebelliousness: but without doubt it was caused from a Contamination
of the whole Mass of Blood, through immoderate drinking, and that many times
either of unnatural liquors, or at least such as were obnoxious to his
constitution and habit of the Body, from whence upon a fermentation of Blood,
it cast forth its diseasie matter into the parts thus afflicted: and the
stubbornness of the Mallady seemed to arise from the peccability of the whole
bloody, mass, whereby, when the matter broken forth was cast off, there was a
perpetual supply of new, and that without end, as it were, for that all the
juyces of the Body were universally corrupted.

5. This evil thus afflicting our Patient, I was forced to think of new ways of
cure; and in the first place I purposed a rectification of the sanguinous mass,
which I thus performed. I caused him constantly Morning and Noon to take two or
three ounces of Viper-Wine: and at Night going to bed, two scruples or a dram:
of the Viper Powder (purging him every sixth day, with a strong tincture of
Sena.) these Viperine Medicaments were continued for about thirty five or
thirty six days, by means of which the Leprous disposition of the Blood became
changed: and I ordered for his drink a strong Decoction of Sarsa parilla, of
which he drank a quart, and sometimes three-pints a day, which was begun when he
began to take the Viperine Medicaments, and was continued about fifty days.

6. Outwardly to his Face and other parts afflicted with this evil, I applied a
Vesicatory, which was that of the shops: it was laid on at Bedtime, viz. about
ten a clock at Night, and taken off the next Day at Noon; the Blisters being
cut or removed, a green Cole-wort-leaf was applied to the same twice a day, the
smooth side first, for the two first days; and then afterward the rough-side,
till such time as the Sores were perfectly healed: by this means we had hopes
to have cleared the skin; but as yet we succeeded not: about a week after it
had been well, it broke out again afresh, as plentifully as ever, upon which we
repeated the vesicatories in like manner as before, healing it up also, as
aforesaid, with the Colewort leaf: about seven or eight days after, it broke
forth again, as before; I encouraged my Patient to make one trial more of the
Vesicatories all things was don, as desired, with great expectations of a cure,
but yet we were unsuccessful.

7. However after the third application of the Vesicatory, the Malady was
apparently decreased, insomuch, that we now hoped for a perfect cure: I
entreated him once more to apply the Vesicatories, and with much ado prevailed;
they were applied as before, and in about four or five days healed up, after
which the Disease broke no more forth, and this our Patient remained in perfect
health.

8. From hence it is manifest how rebellious those Diseases are, which are
seated in the Mass of Blood, and how strangely they resist the force of all
Medicaments, at last when they are only Cuticular, although all the juyces of
the Body be thoroughly rectified; and the seed of the Disease only remains in
the Cutis: For nature then distributing her juyces, though never so pure, into
each respective part, falling upon the morbifick matter in the Cutis, that (as
a ferment) turns all the said pure juice, into an impure leprous matter, and so
continually discharges it, through the Pores of the skin, whence comes that
perpetual breaking out, although the Blood be made never so clean.

9. And here it is evident, that Vesicatories are of notable use in all
Cuticular Diseases, especially where the mass of Blood is not contaminated; or
having been contaminated, is now made pure again: And also that oftentimes,
either the Disease is so deeply rooted, or the morbifick matter is so
plentiful, that once, or twice applying of Vesicatories will not do; though on
the contrary, many times such like maladies have been cured at the first
application: but this I spoke that none who do attempt this cure, should be
discouraged, if the success should not answer after the first, second, or third
application, for that manifold experiments have confirmed to me, that such like
Diseases have been perfectly conquered at the third or fourth applications,
whose inveteracy has renddred them seemingly incurable after the first or
second attempt.

III. A Tremor or Trembling in a Woman arising from Drunkenness.

1. Having in the first place interdicted all strong liquors, I purged her with
my Family Pills with Aloes, three or four several times, letting three or four
days be between each purgation; in which intervalls I gave her Ens, Veneris,
twelve grains at a time in conserve of Roses, which she took at Night going to
Bed: and in the Morning following it, twenty drops of the Spiritus Diapente in
conserve of Wormwood.

2. I ordered her to take constantly this following Diet: Tako raspings of
Guajacum, of Sassafras, and of yellow Sanders, of each half a pound: Cortex
Guajaci, Liquorice scraped, of each four ounces: Mealy Sarsaparilla, two
pounds: Carraway seed, Juniperberries, Coriander seeds all bruised, of each
three ounces: Raisons of the sun stoned: Figs slit, of each two pounds:
Spring Water, twenty four quarts: infuse all in a gentle heat for twenty four
hours, then boil all together for the space of six hours, or to the consumption
of eight or nine quarts: then strain out, let it settle, and bottle it up, with
a little white Sugar, and a Clove in it, and keep it for use: of this she drunk
a bottle every day; and the quantity of the decoction was three times repeated.

3. Outwardly, I caused all the Trembling parts to be bathed in the Morning
with Powers of Amber, and at Night going to bed with Spirit or Tincture of
Castor; and sometimes with Spirit of Earthworms; and over the joints of her
Wrists, I applied this following Plaster or Cataplasm: Take Venice Treacle or
Mithridate, four ounces: powder of Myrrh, (mixed with pure spirit of Wine) one
ounce: Turpentine, half an ounce: and the yolk of one Egg: mix all together
very well, and make it of a convenient thickness with powder of Bay berries,
which spread upon Leather, and apply to the parts mentioned, and let it be
renewed once every twenty four hours. Following these my directions she was in
about five or six weeks time restored to her perfect health.

4. But whereas she complained to me of the obstruction of her Courses, I
purged her again two or three times with my Family-Pills with Aloes before
mentioned, with the intervals of three or four days; and withal I ordered her
to take in the intermediate days thirty or forty drops of Elixir Proprietatis,
thrice a day in a glass of Canary, or Rhensh-Wine and Sugar, and by this means,
(all this being done sometime before the expectation of their flowing,) they
came down very well, which without doubt contributed something toward her
desired Health.

5. This Woman had (unknown to me, till afterward) an old Ulcer upon one of
her Legs, which had being there, and continued running for more than twelve
years, and had been under mady Chyrurgions hands, and always given over as
incurable,: This Ulcer, by the course above prescribed abstinence from taking
in of strong Liquors, and a constancy in the Diet-drink, abovementioned, was
perfecty healed up, without any other Provision for the same, than what she
commonly dressed it withal: such is the Power and Virtue of good Medicines, if
rightly fitted and adopted to the proper Intentions of healing.

IV. A Tremor or Trembling concomitant with a fierce and vehement Catarrh.

1. This Person was a Man temperate in all things, but as far as I can gather
by relation, by getting cold toward Winter, was afflicted with a vehement
Catarrh, which being suddenly and imprudently stopped, before the morbifick
matter was carried off, or the Parts strengthened, to prevent the generation of
more for the future, it fell upon all the extreme Parts of the Body, from
whence it is supposed came this long continued and almost paralytick kind of
Tremor or Trembling.

2. But that which mostly contributed to the compleatment of this Disease, was
an evil disposition of the Blood, contaminated with the catarrhous matter, for
want of being duly carried off the right way: from which ill disposed Blood,
those Parts being nourished, they received its morbifick disposition; whereby
the Nerves being watered, and as it were, oppressed with a heterogeneous Juice,
became lax and feeble, and thereby a spreading abroad of the animal Spirit,
which ought to have been more strictly bound up, in order to the faithful
performance of its Operations: for the said Spirit being spread abroad through
the laxity and febleness of its Organs, the motion of the Part (of which the
animal Spirit is the root or principal cause) became depraved.

3. To remedy these Evils I purged him with my Family-Pills with Aloes, and
sometimes with a Tincture of the same, which was done six or seven times, with
due Intervals; by this the Patient confessed he found some Relief, but far from a
Cure: In the intermediate days I ordered him constantly to take Elixir
Proprietatis, thirty drops at a time, thrice a day in a glass of choice Canary,
half an hour or better before eating: at breakfast to eat a Biscuit, or some
such like thing. After Dinner to take a spoonful or more of choice
Cinnamon Water, and the like at Night, after Supper.

4. The time of purging being over I prescribed him the Diet mentioned in the
former Observation at 2. to be taken constantly for threescore days; and now
and then a spoonful or two of Cinnamon Water, as aforesaid, for his Stomach
sake. Every Morning fasting, he took volatile Salt of Amber, volatile Salt of
Hartshorn, of each ten grains, in two drams of Conserve of Wormwood, fasting
an hour after it: before eating at Noon, the quantity of a Nutmeg of the
Electuarium ad Tabidos; and at Night going to bed sixteen grains of Bezoar
mineral in Conserve of Roses, drinking a little glass of Sack after it, to wash
it down and then to sweat well upon it.

5. This last thing was done five Nights together: afterward he ordinarily
took but twelve grains of the Bezoar mineral in Conserve of Roses, without
sweating upon it, and only sweat every third or fourth Night, at which time the
Dose was increased to twenty grains. Moreover for a change of the Medicament at
Noon there was sometimes exhibited instead of the Electuarium ad Tabidos, a
dram, or sixty drops of the Tincture of Coral, in Cinnam^n-Water or in Canary:
and sometimes ten drops of the Potestates Cranii humani: and sometimes twenty
drops or more of the blood red Tincture of Tartar.

6. Outwardly I caused all the weakened and trembling Parts, but more especially
the Backbone, from the beginning of the spinal Marrow to the Os Coccygis to be
bathed Morning and Night with the Powers of Amber: Sometimes with the Powers of
Lavender: and sometimes with the Tincture of Castoreum, by which he confessed he
found much Comfort and Refreshment, and also Ease from his pains, for the
places upon which the principal defluction was, were commonly pained either
more or less.

7. Moreover, I caused his Head to be shaved six inches diameter over the
Crown, and to be bathed Morning and Night with the aforenamed Medicaments, for
about ten days time, after which, I applied to the place, the Emplaster of
Franciscus Valesius, formerly mentioned in this Work, in the former Book, in
the Chapter of the Falling-Siokness, which went not without its desired Effects.

8. But that we might perfect the Cure thus happily begun and carried on, I
prescribed my Laudanum, made of a fermented Opium, and repleat with volatile
Salts, (the Recipe whereof, you will hereafter have in my Chemistry which is
now in the Press) I first gave him two grains and continued the Dose for 4
days: the fifth day I gave him three grains, and continued the Dose for four
other days: the ninth day, I gave him four grains, and continued the Dose for
four other days: the twelfth day I gave him five grains: the sixteenth day I
increased the Dose to six grains: the twentieth day, I increased the Dose to
seven grains: the four and twentieth day, I increased the Dose to eight grains:
from which time I gave him every Night eight, nine, or ten grains, as I saw
occasion for a Month or somewhat more, at the end of which time, he conceived
himself to be perfectly well.

9. By this very Method I cured an ancient Gentlewoman of a Tremor or
Trembling, which was caused by a Catarrh going before; and this after she had
been troubled with it above two years.

10. I moreover cured a middle-aged Man, nearly with the very same things, who
had a Trembling seized him, after the long affliction of a Tertian Ague, and
the loss of above an hundred ounces of Blood, accompanied with a vehement
Catarrh, and a violent Cough, Hoarsness, and Wheezing.

11. I also cure^ a young Gentlewoman of a like affliction, who had been
formerly seized with the dead Palsy through her whole right side: the said
Palsy was cured by an ancient Physician, but a Trembling of all the extreme
Parts was left behind; which by the aforegoing Method was perfectly taken away
in about ten weeks time, after she had been afflicted therewith above three
years.

V. A Tremor or Trembling in a little Boy, from Worms.

1. This Child was taken with a Trembling of the whole Body, like as one
affrighted, or in an Ague, and yet truly it was neither, but it was not
continual as other Tremblings, but came frequently, and by Fits, which, as the
Event after proved, arose form Worms in the Stomach, for he avoided more than
twenty long, round Worms, of a Span or more in length.

2. When the Physicians were called to see the Child, they could not tell what
to make of his Disease, nor to imagine from what cause his Tremblings came: it
was (as aforesaid) by Fits; but the Paroxysm would last sometimes three, four,
five or six hours, and that in so extreme a manner, as was to the wonderment of
the Bystanders; the Child being also all the while free from Pain: but he had
other times very great torment in his Bowels, and would vehemently cry out,
like one in extreme Misery.

3. This Trembling was frequent with the Boy by Fits, for eighteen Months,
during which time, many things were given without the least imaginable Succ^ss:
at length, an Aunt of the Child's advised the Parents to make use of my
Family-Pills, only for the name sake, and the repute they had in the World:
They gave it two Pills of the Composition with Aloes: they wrought well, and
brought away four long Worms dead.

4. From this Accident they now c^njectured at the Cause, and gave it tw^ Pil^s
more, which again brought away three such other Worms, for this cause they
reiterated the Dose; and withal took up a resolution to give the same till
those Worms ceased to come away: they gave them after this four or five times,
till the Child had avoided three and twenty of those long Worms; after which,
the Child voiding no more, they ceased giving them, and he remained thenceforth
in perfect Health. It had been a kind of impiety, to have with held this
Observation any longer, although it might more properly have been placed under
another Title or Head.

VI. A Tremor or Trembling in an aged Man.

1. This Tremor befell a Man of about eight and fifty years of age, all his
extreme Parts so trembled, that with his Hand he was not able to lift a Cup to
his Mouth, nor scarcely feed himself: when I first saw him, I feared it might
fall to him by reason of his age, but he would not be persuaded but that it
came to him by an overstraining of himself, striving to lift or remove
something, which was above his Power: he was a lusty fat Man, and of a gross
Body.

2. Requesting my Help, I advised him to the drinking of Viper-Wine, and the
taking of Viperine Medicaments: he took the Wine every Morning fasting for two
or three Months together; and the Electuarium ad Tabidos, the quantity of a
Nutmeg, an hour before Dinner, drinking after it a glass of Ale or Wine, in
which forty or sixty dops of the Tincture of Castor were dropped.

3. Moreover I advised him constantly to take the volatile Salt of Mans-skull
in all the Liquor which he drank, and never so much as once to drink without
it; unless at meals; and then I prescribed the volatile Salt of Amber to be
taken in stead thereof.

4. At Night going to bed he took from one dram to two drams of this following
Composition: Take Venice-Treacle, Extracts of Gentian, of Contrayerva, and of
Virginia snake-root, of each two ounces: Extract of Saffron and of Coche^ele,
of each an ounce: choice Myrrh, fine Aloes, of each half an ounce: volatile
Salts of Amber and Hartshorn, of each six drams: Indian green Ginger, an ounce
and half: mix and beat up all into an Electuary, to be taken, as aforesaid.

5. Every Morning and Night I caused his Head and Temples to be bathed with the
Powers of Rosemary: as also his whole Backbone from the highest Vertebra of
the Neck, to the Os Coccygis, together with all his extreme Parts, as his
Fingers, Hands, Arms, Thighs, Legs, Feet, and Toes, to be extremely well bathed
with the Powers of Amber, in like manner twice a day; from which in a very
short time he found much Comfort and Relief; and was completely cured of this
trembling Disease in less than three Months time.

6. Another Man who had a Tremor fallen upon him, in the sixtieth year of his
age, I cured in like manner: but whereas he complained to me of an exceeding
weakness of his Stomach, and how that he could scarcely eat any Food, or if he
did, he was always apt to vomit it up again, I caused him every day (toward
the end of the cure) to take Powers of Wormwood in a glass of Sack, by which
he found a very great Relief: and outwardly I caused him to bath his Stomach
with the Powers of Nutmegs, by means of which, the tone of the Stomach was
strengthened, so that he could both eat and digest any kind of Food, and eat
almost at any hour of the day or night.

7. A Gentlewoman of about forty yers of age corpulent, and very fat, was also
seized with, such a like Tremor, and I cured her also by the former Method;
save, that before I began the said Course I purged her very well with my
Family-Pills with Aloes, by which many evil humors were carried off, and
whereas her Courses were obstructed, they were brought down again, and reduced
to their natural order.

VII. A Tremor or Trembling arising from overgreat Weakness.

1. A Lady having at several times lost above an hundred and fifty ounces of
Blood (being supposed to be in a Consumption) sell into a Tremor or Trembling
of all the extreme Parts of her Body, being then in the thirtieth year of her
age: this Trembling more discomposed her, than all her other illness; because
she feared it was the forerunner of an approaching Palsy.

2. She consulted de novo with several Physicians and great Doctors about it,
who after a long course of Physic gave her over as uncurable: at length by the advice of some Friends she applied herself to me, requesting my assistance:
after an inquiry into her Condition, I found it to proceed purely from
weakness, which as I conceive was occasioned partly from the loss of the
quantity of Blood above named: and partly from the improper Physic which had
been given her, as well as from the force of her Disease: so that I ascribed a
great part of the external cause to the male-practice of her learned Doctors.

3. Her Stomach was exceedingly out of order, so that she could take nothing,
nay not her ordinary Food without vomiting; and so exceedingly was it
enervated, that she constantly loathed all things which were designed to be
received in at her Mouth; so that by reason of the little Nourishment she took
in, her Disease seemed continually to increase upon her, now this evil
disposition of her Stomach, she told me was chiefly caused from the large
quantities and nauciousness of the Medicaments which had been for a long time
given her; so that if I could not find out things more pleasant and delectable,
and such as withal might strengthen her Stomach, she confidently assured
herself, that I should never be able to do her any kindness.

4. These precautions I confess were a means to put me into the right way, and
therefore I consulted with myself, how I might restore the tone of the Stomach,
now so much overturned I perceived the Faculties of the Stomach themselves were
hurt, and that that nauciousness and vomiting rather proceeded therefrom, than
from any real foulness, or quantity of matter filling the same: and I was the
more confirmed in this opinion, because she told me, that her former Doctors
had given her above twenty Vomits, by which she was assured her Stomach was
effectually cleansed.

5. Upon this, I applied my thoughts wholly to strengthners of the Stomach,
Restauratives and Neuroticks, the first thing I gave her was the vulnerary
Spirit of Vitriol, which as it is a great strengthner of the Stomach, so also
it is a thing of very subtle and volatile parts: I orred her to take it in all
the drink she took whether Beer, Ale, or Wine, and to put so much therein at a
time, as might give it a pleasant taste; and to take it as well at meals, as
between meals: by this she confessed she found much good, and in less than a
fortnights time, began to eat her Food indifferently well.

6. But by reason she complained of a coldness at Stomach, and wind which much
oppressed her, I caused her about half an hour before eating to take from fifteen
to thirty drops of the Tincture of black Pepper in a glass of Canary, and this
to do three times a day at least: as also immediately after eating to take a
glass of choice Wormwood-Wine, (made very bitter with the Wormwood) and
sometimes for change, a spoonful or two of the best Cinnamon Water, or half an
ounce of the Aqua Vitae Matthioli: Moreover every Morning fasting, I caused her
to take from forty to sixty drops of Elixir Proprietatis in a glass of generous
Wine; by the constant use of these things, in about twenty days time, her
loathing and vomiting was wholly taken away, as also that windiness and
coldness of the Stomach, of which she so much complained.

7. By the assiduous use of these things, she began to eat and digest her Food
very well, so that now she was put into hopes of a Cure; but that I might
effectually accomplish what I designed, I now applied my self to such things as
were of a pure restorative nature, and withal had a power to comfort and
strengthen the Nerves: For this purpose I prescribed to her the taking of
Electuarium ad Tabidos, to be taken the quantity of a large Nutmeg every
Morning fasting, drinking after it a small glass of Wormwood Wine, and to
continue the same for six or eight weeks as she in the process of time should
see occasion.

8. I ordered her to take the Electuary about six in the Morning, and about
three hours after, viz, about nine a clock, to take this following Neurotick.
Take pure Musk, half an ounce: Ambergrise, one dram: Extracts of Gentian,
Zedoary, Contrayerva, Virginian-snake-root, and Saffron, of each two drams: mix
and with pure juice of Alkernes a sufficient quantity make an Electuary, to be
taken, as aforesaid, from half a dram to a dram, and drinking after it, a
little glass of White or Rhenish-Wine and Sugar: and this same Dose, I so
ordered to be taken at four a clock in the Afternoon, viz. about four hours
after Dinner; and to continue it twice a day for ten or twelve days together;
and afterward only to take it once a day, viz, at ten in the Morning, as long
as need required.

9. At Night going to bed I prescribed a small Dose of my Laudanum, made of a
fermented Opium with volatile Salts; I began with two grains, and caused her to
increase a grain every week, till she took eight grains, which was the largest
Dose; and she continued the use thereof for about three Months. Moreover I was
enduced to the use of the former Medicament made of Musk, because she
exceedingly delighted in that Scent, and assured me, that she ever found it
exceedingly to comfort and refresh her.

10. Lastly, twice a day, viz, Morning and Night, I caused all the Parts
afflicted with the Tremor to be very well bathed with the Powers of Rhodium,
which was done for three weeks, and afterward only once a day, to wit, at
^ight going to bed, just before taking of the Laudanum: These means being
persued according to my directions, her Disease daily weakened, and she
increased in strength; so that in less than a quarter of a year she was (beyond
all expectation) restored to her perfect Health.

VIII. A Tremor or Trembling in a young Lady, proceeding from Affrightment.

1. Being abroad late, she apprehended she saw a Spirit or Ghost, by which
being put into a terrible fear, a notable Trembling seized upon her, which
continued for some hours, with great vehemence, her Friends expecting that when
the terror or affrightment was clearly gone, that probably the Trembling would
leave her.

2. But contrary to their expectation, so great was the disturbance of the
Spirits, that though after a season the terror was clearly vanished, yet it
left behind it, some portion of its effects: for though it was somewhat abated,
in relation to her whole Body, yet it partly remained in all the extreme parts;
so that after ten weeks waiting, in hopes to see it terminate, it then left
work for a Physician to exercise his skill upon.

3. I was at length sent for, to whom they gave the aforesaid relation of her
condition; by which I saw the Nerves and their Original to be indeed affected;
and therefore adhibited to her such proper Cephalick-Neuroticks, as might
probably restore the Economy of the Genus Nervosum or Nervous Systeme: Take
Venice Treacle, one ounce: volatile Salt of Amber, and of Hartshorn, of each
one dram and half: Musk, one dram: with confect of Alkermes a sufficient
quantity, make an Electuary. Of this she took the quantity of a dram and half,
or nearly two drams every Morning fasting, drinking after the same a little
glass of Sack, and fasting after it for the space of two hours.

4. But that we might the more absolutely settle the Spirits, and confirm the
Archeus (thus of late disturbed) I also resolved to give her at Night going to
Bed a dose of my Laudanum (made of a fermented Opium, and repleat with volatile
Salts:) I first gave her three grains, the use of which she continued for a
week every Night: then I gave her four grains for a week more: and augmented it
a grain every week whilst she took it; which was to the end of five weeks, at
which period of time she was restored to her perfect health.

5. Since the performance of this Cure, I have cured four other Persons, who
were affected with a Tremor from affrightment: and that only with Our Laudanum
but now above mentioned, given every Night, as aforesaid, and augmented the
dose only one grain a week, being continued, four or five weeks in like manner:
which Observations are truly worth the taking notice of.

IX. A Tremor in the right Arm and Hand, which was caused by overstraining it.

1. A Servant Maid by some accident (whether of lifting, thrusting, puling, or
holding fast, I cannot now call to mind) had so overstrained the part, that
such a weakness seized the Nerves and Muscles, as caused a continual Tremor or
Trembling, so that she could not hold any thing in her Hand but it would
extremely shake; nor could she guide with it, a Cup of Drink to her Mouth,
whereby she was for a while disabled for her Service.

2. Upon this, I caused for six or seven days time, her said Arm to be very
well bathed with the Powers of Amber, Morning and Night: and then to be bound
up with new Flannel and so kept warm.

3. A week being past, I caused this Cataplasm following to be applied: Take
Mithridate eight ounces: fat Myrrh (dissolved in a sufficient quantity of
Spirit of Wine,) one ounce: Orrice root in powder, enough to make it of a fit
consistencie; mix them well for a Cataplasm. This was spread upon Lambs leather
and applied to the part affected: it lay two Days and two Nights, and then was
renewed; and was repeated in all about five times: at the end of which she
found her self well, and her Arm restored to its complete strength.

4. But while these things were doing, I thought good to give her a few doses
of my Laudanum aforementioned, which she took to four grains every Night, for a
fortnight together, drinking after it a glass of Rhenish Wine and Sugar.

5. Another Maid Servant who had a Tremor in one of her Arms and Hands which
came by overstraining, was cured by taking the Laudanum every Night, as
aforesaid, and bathing the part affected with the said Powers of Amber: but
instead of the Cataplasm of Mithridate and Myrrh, she applied a Pultise made of
raw Comfrey roots, being cleansed and beaten till they were soft, in a
stone-Morter, and then spread upon Leather, which was renewed every third day,
and repeated four times.

6. And by this latter method, I cured a little Youth of eight years of age,
who had a Tremor seized upon all his extreme parts, caused, as was supposed by
a blow given him over the Reins of his Back: the Youth lay several weeks in a
very sad and languishing condition, and also in perpetual Pain, so that some
Physicians thought it to be a Nephritis; others an Apostemation of these parts,
or some, other thing: after three months time he fell into my hands; by the
first dose of my Laudanum the Child had ease of his Pain, and by the assiduous
use thereof, it was wholly removed: and the Cure was completed by applying to
the Reins of the Back the Powers of Amber, and the Cataplasm of Comfrey roots
in manner, as aforesaid.

X. A Tremor of Trembling caused from a perturbation of the Spirit.

1. A Woman near thirty years of age, of a melancholy disposition of body, and
very apt to be frighted upon the least occasion, was at length taken with a
Tremor, which had now continued upon her above two years, so that a Palsy was
feared to ensue: she was Hypochondriack, and complained of a great oppression
of the Spleen, which would be so great sometimes that she could not lie upon her
left Side.

2. This Woman oftentimes seemed to be indifferent well, but if she drank any
thing of strong liquors, as strong waters or Wine, she would be in a manner
raging mad, as if she had been affrighted out of her wits; and this would befall
her, if that she drank but strong drink plentifully; so that she would cry out
of being killed, frighted with Swords, and that she saw Devils, Ghosts, and
such like; and so violent and extreme would her fits be upon such an occasion,
that three or four Men could scarcely hold her; that what with the dread or
terror upon her Spirits, and her violent struggling for two or three hours
together, she would be so weakened, that when she came to her self, she could
scarcely stand alone, but would tremble so that she could not hold a joint of
her.

3. This great Trembling seldom lasted upon her longer than an hour, after the
affrightment was over; but by reason of the many affrightments and other
perturbations of Spirit which frequently followed her, she became so enervated,
that at length although the great Trembling might go off, yet it left behind
it, upon the extreme parts, a very notable weakness so that she could not hold
any thing in either of her Hands, without a Tremor or shaking of the same,
which she thought to be a great affliction upon her.

4. She had tried many Physicians but all in vain, and by their advice she lost
at times above an hundred and forty ounces of Blood, which they pretended was
to cure her of her madness, which whatever it might do in that respect, I will
not say; one thing I am sure of, that it vastly weakened her, and contributed
much to her Tremor or shaking. I first purged the Melancholy humor with the
following Tincture: Take Sena, two ounces: Crystals of Tartar, one ounce:
Scammony, three drams: Cinnamon, Cloves, Galangal, Zedoary, Aniseeds, of each a
dram and half: juice of Liquorice, half a dram: mix and with white Wine, and
choice Canary, of each a pint: make a Tincture: This was given her at three
times, something more than three ounces at a time, and that every third day,
with observation after taking the same, as in other purges. By the means of
this purging, the Melancholy humor was mightily abated, and Our Patient grew
after it very cheerful and merry:

5. In the intermediate days I ordered, her to take Tinctura Paralytica Mylij,
which was given her three ounces or more at a time, Morning, Noon, and Might.
The preparation thereof you may see in Our Pharmacopoea, lib. 4. cap. 7. sect.
36. by which she found much good: for her Drink I ordered a small decoction of
Guajacum, Sarsa, and Sassafras, completed with seeds, to be taken at all times
when thirst required.

6. But whereas she complained much of the pain of her Spleen, I ordered her
every Night (except the evening before the day of purging) to take a dose of my
Laudanum; she began with two grains, and increased the dose a grain, every
fourth or fifth day till she took ten or twelve grains at a time, drinking
after it, a little glass of Mylius his Paralytick Tincture, made (not with
Wine, but) with Cardamom water.

7. Outwardly, I caused all the Trembling parts to be bathed with the Powers of
Amber, Morning and Evening, for fourteen or sixteen days together, by which
they became warmed and strengthened; and indeed by the constant using of these
things, the Tremor was wholly taken away.

8. Notwithstanding, she yet complained of her Spleen, and the pain on her left
side, for which I ordered her to take constantly every Morning fasting, and an
hour before Dinner of Mynsichts Tinctura Juniperi, the quantity of an ounce at
a time; it heats, opens, attenuates, provokes urine, expells wind, and gives
ease to all the most vehement pains of the Bowels or other Viscera, you may see
the preparation thereof in Our Pharmacopoeia Londinensis, lib. 4. cap. 7. sect.
32. This Tincture she took for at least two hundred days, withal taking the
Laudanum every Night going to Bed.

9. After the former purges were taken, I sometimes, ( viz. once in fourteen or
sixteen days) purged her with this: Take Extract of black Hellebor, a dram:
Pil. Rudij, a dram and half: mix and make a mass of Pills for four doses: and
sometimes for change of Medicaments, I gave her in the Morning fasting
Mindererus his Extractum Diapaeonias (the preparation of which see in Our
Pharmacopoeia, lib. 4. cap. 8. sect. 10. to the quantity of one dram, drinking
after it a glass of black Cherry-water sweetened with syrup of Citrons. This
comforted and restored the Animal Spirit, fortified the whole Genus Nervosum,
and in process of time perfectly took away that Pain of the Spleen, with which
she had been formerly so exceedingly tormented.

10. But we were not unmindful also outwardly to bath the regions of the Liver
and Spleen with the Powers of Amber Morning and Night, which was continued for
twelve or fourteen nights; by the benefit of this Medicine, together with the
Tincture of Juniper, Extractum Diapaeonias, and Our Laudanum the Pain and Tumor
of the Spleen (for there was a hard Tumor outwardly to be felt) together with
the Tremor or Trembling was wholly taken away, and in less than a years time
this miserable creature was restored to her health.

Observations from other Author

XI. A Trembling of the Limbs.

1. For a singular remedy in this case; first of all the Electuary Orvietanum
is commended by Platerus, which is as follows: Take the roots of Gentian,
Bistort, Carline, Tormentil, white Dittander, Calamus Aromaticus, round
Birth-wort, Wolfs-bane, the herb blessed thistle, the seeds of Vipers-Bugloss;
Alkanet, Citron, of each one ounce: make them into a fine powder, to which add
the roots of Vipers-grass powdered, the weight of them all; clarified Honey;
with a sufficient quantity of generous Wine, three times as much, and toward
the latter end of boiling mix of the best Venice Treacle, one pound and half:
and keep it for use; the dose is from half a dram to a dram, Platerus, tom. 1.
lib. 2. cap. 3. page 353.

2. Another good remedy in this case is, to wash the trembling members in
Urine; some commend urine of a Child as the best; it is esteemed as an
indubitable experiment from what cause soever the trembling arises whether from
Venery, or excess of Wine, or from other Diseases, or the fume of Quicksilver.

3. In the trembling of the Hands, I exhibit after universal Medicaments, those
that have the credit of strengthening the Head and nervous parts; such is
chiefly Diacorus, Extractum Calami; outwardly the trembling Hands were fomented
with warm Wine; in which Betony, Sage, Marjoram, Rosemary, and the like are
boiled; and for penetration sake I poured in some of the spirit of Wine; Petrus
Monavius Epist. 28. lib. 2. Con. and Epist. Cratonis.

XII. A Tremor or Trembling in an aged Woman.

1. A Woman aged fifty years, being afflicted with trembling of the Arms and
Thighs, afterward felt vapors ascending to the Heart, thence to the Throat,
and after thought herself suffocated, was thus cured.

2. Take Mercurius vitae, fiv^ grains: Diaphaenicon, half a dram: mix them;
this exhibited, gave two vomits, and two stools, and afterward she took Venice
Treacle, one dram, in posset drink.

3. I purged her with the former again; only adding one grain of the Mercury,
which gave four stools; after which she had the former Treacle with the
shavings of Hartshorn, for four days, By which she was helped miraculously,
all symptoms vanishing. Hall, upon English Bodies, cent. 1. Observe. 39.

XIII. A Trembling of the Hands.

1. A certain Apothecary told me that a Goldsmiths in the City of Brussels, was
cured of his trembling by eating the brains of an Hare roasted, and those kind
of wild Pigeons which haunt the Woods.

2. But as to other Medicines, take for a light purge the following Pills: Take
pil. de hiera simplicis, two scruples and half: Troches of Agarick, half a
scruple: with Sage water make seven Pills.

3. Afterward by the following things prepare the pituitous matter: Take the
decoction of Sage, Rosemary, Hysop, Betony, Cowslips, Gout-Ivy, the flowers of
Staechas, add thereto the syrup Staechas, and the Honey of Rosemary-flowers,
and then let him purge with these Pills.

4. Take Pil. Cochiae, two scruples and half: Castoreum, half a scruple: with
Sage-water, make seven Pills, let them be taken in the morning early.

5. Afterward use a masticatory of Mastich, the roots of Pyrethrum, with a
little Wax; the Troches being prepared; take one of them and chew it every
morning, for the space of a quarter of an hour, that the Rheum may flow forth;

6. When you have don this, anoint the Neck then the Backbone, Arm and Hand,
with the Oil of Lillies; in which the flowers of Lilly-Convally are infused and
macerated before the Sun.

7. Wash the Trembling Hand with the decoction of Sage, Rosemary, Lavender,
Marjoram, and Earth worms, then anoint with the Oil of Costus and Spike, some
d^ops of Aqua Vitae and a little Castoreum, or the Oil of the fl^wers of
Trefoil being added.

8. These things as also Castoreum either taken inwardly or outwardly are good
for this Disease; moreover it is required that all hurtful things be forborne,
viz. frequent Blood-letting, too much use of wine Vinegar, Venery and washing
in cold water; For these not only nourish but generate a trembling, and are
Inimical to the Nerves.

9. This following is excellent to wash the Trembling Members in, Morning and
Evening: Take Sage ten handfuls: the flowers of Lavender, six handfuls: the
flowers of Rosemary, and Staechas, of each two handfuls: Castoreum, six ounces:
Spirit of Wine, one pound: Rhenish wine, twenty eight ounces: let them putrify
in the Sun, till they grow slimy.

10. It will help much to wash in the persons own urin; or in a decoction of
Sage in Wine; or infuse the Sage in Malago Wine, let it putrify and distill it
in an Alembick; add the juice of Agrimony, or rather the juice of Sage and
distill them together, let the first distillation be light and when the
stillitory begins to grow hot, take it from the fire, and add the juice, and
then distill them again.

11. Infuse Juniper berries for a night in water; afterward let them be
covered with Aqua Vita, and let them stand eight days together in the infusion,
and then decant off the clear Liquor, and let there be taken ten drams of it
every day; it strengthens the Nerves and removes the trembling from the Hands.

12. But this Balsam is only commended as being good against trembling
Convulsion and torture, with which the Backbone and Nape is to be anointed,
these universal evacuations being premissed: Take choice Myrrh, Aloes,
Hepatica, Spikenard, Sanguis Draconis; Mummy, Oppopanax, of each two drams and
half: Carpobalsamum, Saffron, Mastich, gum Arabic, Liquid Styrax, and red
Styrax, of each two drams and half: Musk, half a dram: Cowslips, two handfuls:
Turpentine to the weight of them all, beat them to a powder that are to be
beaten, and mix them, and then distill them.

13. Resolving frictions will be convenient as also covering the Trembling
members in hot Sand, or hot Ashes or hot Dung; if these do no good then make
use of the Decoction of Guajacum, Petrus Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 99.

14. But if this Disease of Trembling be the consequence of some daily
indisposition or sickness; prepare this or the like confection: Take the pulp
of young Storks boiled in wine to a mash, three ounces: the Brains of a Hare
roasted, one ounce: sweet Almonds number thirty, fresh pine-nuts washed in
Hydromel, number twenty, Currants, one ounce: Species Resumptivi, two drams:
Cinnamon, three drams: Ginger, Cloves, Galangal, Mace, of each one scruple:
Cardamoms, half a scruple: Musk, two grains: Sugar Candy, two ounces: clarifyed
Honey, a sufficient quantity.

15. If the Trembling proceed from frequent touching of Quicksilver, as it
sometimes happens to Goldsmiths in the exercise of their trade, anoint the part
with hot Oils, and such as are in some measure constringent, as this which
Rendelitius used.

16. Take Schaenantus, Spica, Calamus, Aromaticus, Cypress, Nutmegs, of each
one scruple: Hermodacts, Satyrion, of each half an ounce: the juice of Sage,
four ounces: Oil of Castoreum, three ounces: with a little wax make an
Ointment; for the Richer sort, add the subtle calx of Gold, half a dram, anoint
therewith the Hands and the superior Vertebrae.

17. In the place of Gold add, if for the poorer sort, two drams of Treacle;
sometimes a Trembling happens, from the fumes of Henbane and white Poppy; let
him wash his Hands in the decoction of the flowers of Staechas, Sage and the
roots of Galangal, Ex scholis ejusdem.

XIV. The Trembling and palpitation of the Muscles of the Cheek-bone.

1. A certain country Woman about the age of thirty five, fair and of a good
stature, was long afflicted with a Trembling or Palpitation about the Muscles
of the Cheek-bone; this Woman was long without her Flowers; therefore I
concluded this Distemper might arise from the Womb.

2. After I had ordered frictions both of the Feet and Legs for diverting the
vapors, as also ligatures, I commended her to use this following decoction:
Take the roots of Fennel, Rhubarb, Parsley, Butchers-broom, of each half an
ounce: roots of Peony, two drams: Madder, three drams: Betony, two handfuls:
Sage, Mugwort, Vervain, Savin, Agrimony, Hore-hound, Marjoram, Centary the
lesser, Scabius, Bawm, Maidenhair, of each an handful: Fumitary, Savory, of
each half an handful: Fennel seeds and Faenugreek, of each two drams: Raisons
stoned, one ounce: Sena, one ounce and half: Epithymum, Polypody of the Oak, of
each one dram: boil them all in water; and to one pound and half of the
straining add syrup of Mugwort, syrup of Vinegar, and syrup of Staechas, of
each one ounce: make an Apozem, which she used twice a day; by this she was
conveniently purged.

3. After she took these Pills: Take troches of Myrrh, two scruples: pil.
Aureae and Cochiae, of each one scruple: with syrup of Mugwort, make seven
Pills: by this she was well purged.

4. We also ordered for diverting, Cupping-glasses with scarification to the
saphenick Veins about the Ankle, then two to the Hips, then two to the Shoulder
blades; this being done, her Feet was washed in a decoction of Time, Fetherfew,
Mugwort, Vervain, the flowers of Camomil, red Coleworts, Baum, Marjoram, Savin,
Juniper Berries, Salt, Bran, of each one handful: boil them in a sufficient
quantity of water.

5. Let her for some time receive the vapors there from first, and then wash
her Feet, Throat and Cheek-bone; anointing with the Ointment of Alabaster and
Nard, thoroughout the whole course of these Medicines she had not but one sit;
and she grew afterward well: Petrus Forestus, lib. 10. Observe. 100.

XV. The Trembling of the Members.

1. That same Trembling which you propose (most learned Orpheus) in the
stongest age of Man, cannot proceed but from very grievous and preternatural
causes; and because I do not understand that the Patients Brain is remarkably
afflicted, nor that Phlegm does any where abound, there must be foam
extraordinary cause of this symptom.

2. Considering the Patients by past-life, and the constitution of his Body; I
am with you induced to think, that his Nerves and solid parts, are weakened by
immoderate use of strong unmixt Wine and of Vene^y, and that they are now
become, so feeble that they cannot perform their natural and wonted office.

3. Neither being able firmly to move, nor to hold the Joints steadfast, hence
is Trembling caused, which is then urgent, when the Patient is put in fear,
either by the presence of great persons, or upon some other occasion as is
usual.

4. And seeing that this Trembling has its original rather from the dryness
then the repletion of the Nerves, it will hardly admit of Cure, even as a
Convulsion springing from emptiness.

5. Yet if you have a mind to make a trial, you must endeavor a Cure, not by
purgations or immoderate evacuations, but by the contrary causes, and a good
course or Diet.

6. Nevertheless, if you shall perceive any Crudity to stand in the way; that
may safely be removed, either with a Clyster or with a potion of Rhubarb and
Agarick, you may do it.

7. And if also you shall think fit to purge pure Choler; which abounding about
the Midriff, is many times observed to rush into the Nerves of the
Spinal-Marrow; and sometimes to cause Trembling, other whiles nummedness and
Palsy: the self-same, or some such potion should be repeated, every tenth day.

8. Also he should be prepared two or three days before his purging, by
Apozems: and in the intervenient days, if he by bound, he must have a Clyster,
with a good deal of Hiera simple, and Honey of Rosemary.

9. This method of Cure is to be continued to the thirtieth or fortieth day, or
at least till his Trembling do begin to go away. At which time he must wholly
forbear Wine; abstinence only from which, has cured these Diseases.

10. And let his Drink be either Barley-water, or ordinary Ptisan; in which
Cinnamon or Nutmeg are steeped; or a dilute decoction of Guajacum, which they
call a Botchet; or Metheglin, wherein Sage has been steeped.

11. Let him use Meat of good juice and sparingly, sometimes roast, sometimes
boiled, that it may neither altogether dry, nor over much moisten; when by
means of good Diet, and the aforesaid Medicaments, his Body shall seem not so
much to tremble, and so the humor will be prepared, and the antecedent cause
evacuated; then it will be good to use Baths, wherein Cephalic roors and herbs
are boiled, or a Balneum Vaporis thereof composed, wherein for some days
together, in the Morning his Body is to be rubbed, till the Sweat runs down.

12. And when he is dried, let him be laid in a warm Chamber, wherein all his
Backbone must be anointed with this following Oil: Take Staechas,
Rosemary-flowers, Sage, Marjoram, Primroses, of each one handful: Bay Berries,
and Juniper Berries, of each half an ounce: Nutmegs, Ginger, Cloves, Pellitory
of Spain, of each three ounces: all being bruised, sprinkle thereupon a pint of
Aqua Vitae, then pour thereon common Oil, a pint and half: let them boil
together over a gentle Fire, till all the Water be drunk up, press out the Oil,
and reserve it for the use aforesaid: and never leave this Course, till his
trembling be quite gone.

13. If happily during the Cure any suspicion of a distillation shall arise,
which may concur to foment the Trembling. It also must be dried with Millet and
other fried Seeds, and with a Fumigation: Or if it prove very troublesome, it
may fitly be derived by Errhins, or a Nose-Liquor. Johan. Fernelius, Couns. 16.

XVI. A Trembling with a Heaviness.

1. A certain Gentleman in a Letter propounded his case thus to the learned
Fernelius: I began to feel a great illness with a Trembling of all my Members;
especially after meat and sleep, a pain goes from the middle of my Hip,
directly to the Brain, comprehending all the right side of my Backbone and
reaching to my Arm on the same side; and all my Members remain heavy, so as not
to be moved, and to desire nothing but sleep, especially after meals.

2. And I feel through the whole habit of my Body, a certain fluxion under my
skin of Waters, which sometimes makes a tumult like a swift Torrent, and
sometimes they run slowly, so that you would say, it were only the elevation of
a thick Vapor, through the nervous Parts, as far as to my Gums.

3. Now my Head is frequently vexed with coldness, as also other outward Parts
of the Body: nor can I long stand upright, nor endure to stand still; and the
right side of my Body seems absolutely fallen away and pined.

4. The Answer of Fernelius. A frequent distillation falling upon the Muscles,
Nerves and Membranes, especially on the right side, is one, if not the only
Cause of all these Symptoms, which are declared in your Letter, as of heaviness
and pain, which is in your Back, Arms, Hands, and right Hip: whereunto is added
a weakness of your Body; by reason of the ill constitution of the Stomach, and
Bowels for they are obstructed and impure, nor do they conveniently nourish the
Body.

5. And the causes are, Frustration of Concoction, and the Head especially, but
the whole Body withal, clouded with Vapors and wonderfully burdened.

6. In this Variety and Contrariety of Infirmities, a light and a gentle Cure
must be undertaken, which may cleanse the Head and Nerves, and as little
offending the Stomach and Bowels as may be.

7. In the first place therefore the whole Body must be purged with this
following Syrup twice a Month, which is compounded with respect to all the
premises: Take a Syrup made of Cephalic, Hepatick, and Splenetick
Medicaments, with three ounces of Sena, and two drams of Agarick.

8. Five or six days together after purging, take fasting, at least two hours
before meat one of the following Lozenges: Take Powder of Diamargaritum
frigidum, and Electuarium laetificans Galeni, of each half a dram: Shavings of
Ivory and Hartshorn, and choice Cinnamon, of each a scruple: white Sugar
dissolved in Rose Water, three ounces: make an Electuary in Tables or Lozenges,
weighing three drams a piece.

9. Also these dry Remedies following, are to be used to purge and strengthen
your Head; Phlegm must be drawn out at your Nostrils by the Juice of Marjoram
and Beets, or some strong Sternutatorie.

10. Your Head must be dried and strengthened by the ordinary Bags, and, as for
the coolness and weakness of your Nerves, if any thing help you, it must be a
Decoction of Guajacum used at meals in stead of Wine, in the Morning to sweat
upon: which sweating if your strength will not bear, at least your whole Body
must be rubbed pretty hard, soon after sleep with hot and dry linen clothes,
and afterward with moderate Exercise let all your Joints belong warmed and
strengthened.

11. After you have been purged two or three times by the Syrup; if your Joints
prove not sufficiently firm and strong, use dry Baths, or Bath-stoves, which
have a mighty Faculty to dry and strengthen the Nerves.

12. They must be made after this manner: Take Juniper Berries, Roots of Acorus
and Elecampane, of each two ounces: Sage, Betony, Marjoram, Staechas, Bays,
Wormwood, Origanum, Calaminth, Rue, Cammomil, Melilot, Dill, of each a handful:
Aniseeds, Fennelseeds, of each half an ounce: boil all in Water and white Wine:
pour the decoction on a hot Tile, and receive the Vapor in a Hogs-head, or
other covered bathing Vessel till your Body grow hot, and the Sweat run out.

13. If you cannot easily endure the Stove; at least lie in your Bed in the
Morning very well covered, and let hot Stones extinquished in the foresaid
Decoction, be laid to the Soles of your Feet.

14. And thus as you lie, you may gently sweat, and let the Sweat be wiped off.
And this Course must be continued till your Nerves be sufficiently firm and
strong.

15. As to Diet, eat but twice a day, and that sparingly, that your weak Bowels
may not be overwhelmed, let your meat be of good Juice, and easy of Digestion,
such as all Men are wont to commend.

16. Eat no Fish, or a very little, no Beans or Pease, or the like. Abstain
also from Fruits and Herbs that are raw, from all Suppings and Broths, and from
all those things, which overmuch fill and moisten the Body.

17. Use Wine that is neither very vaporous nor strong, but thin and
plentifully allaied with pure Water, least it trouble the Brain and Nerves.
Abstain from all other Drinks, and use that soberly and sparingly; because
nothing does more cool and moisten the Nerves and oppress the whole Body with
heaviness, than overmuch pouring in of Drink.

18. After meals you must sleep long, except noonday sleeps which must be
avoided. Johan. Fernelius, cons. 17.

XVII. The involuntary Trembling of the Joints without any Pain.

1. There was a certain woman who above twelve or more years had her left Side
in continual motion against her will, whilst she waked; her left Eye always
twinkled, her Lips always moved in the action of opening and closeing them
together; her Arms Fingers and Feet were always stiring; yet all this was
without any sense of Pain; when she slept all was quiet and without motion.

2. There was another also about the age of forty; a Man Melancholic and
Corpulent; whilst he was performing some part of his office as a Minister, had
an Involuntary motion of his left Foot.

3. As to the first intention; I would rub the Backbone, chiefly about the end
of the Neck and the beginning of the Os Sacrum, (universals being praemissed,)
with Aqua aurea Langij, the water of Swallows being added with Castoreum and
the spirit of Lillys Convally, five pints: in which infuse a nodul made of
Castoreum, the flowers of Lavender, Staechas, the leaves of Rue, Sage, Betony,
Rosemary-flowers, Camomil, Camphir, etc. After some few days you may decant the
clear, and use it as aforesaid.

4. Also a fomentation to be used before the former things, would do much good:
Take the leaves of Sage, Rosemary, Germander, Ground Pine, Betony, the flowers
of Staechas, Chamomil, Bay and Juniper Berries, etc. boil them all in Wine.

5. As to the second intention; his Thigh and down the Leg to his very Toe, as
also his Hand and Fingers, is to rubed and fomented with a new sponge in a
decoction of Sage-Wine.

6. Afterward a Balsam made of Man's fat is to be used frequently: Take Man's
fat, six ounces: clear Turpentine, so much; the fat of a Badger and a Fox, of
each three ounces: the Oil of Bays, Mastich, and Spikenard, of each half an
ounce: Bay Leaves, Germander, Sage, Marjoram, of each one handful: Aqua vitae,
rectificate, eight ounces: steep them in water, for the space of twenty four
hours, afterward distill them.

7. I ascribed much good to the spirit of Tartar well rectified, to be
exhibited by way of friction. Oleum distillatur, Galbani Cratonis may be
profitably applied outwardly; whose use may be also convenient for the first
intention, unless the smell offend.

8. In the third place, I shall say nothing to the government of the whole, but
I am altogether of opinion that nature may be succored by Infusum Spleneticum
Laxativum, which being done, in the next place, I would have exhibited twice a
week pil. Marocostin, one scruple before Supper.

9. And in the Morning, not omitting universal Corroboratives, I would give in
the first place Elixir proprietatis, Paracelsi, then let the Spirit of
Turpentine distilled with Vinegar, obtain the second place.

10. I would strengthen particularly the Head by using Amber-grise, with the
Extractum ligni Aloes, a sufficient quantity of Sugar dissolved in the water of
Lilly-Convally: make all into Rowls.

11. A Drink made of Sorrel is not inconvenient because of the Concurrent
affection of the Spleen; I do also advise for draining the superfluous humors,
and strengthening the parts affected, a Drink rather then a Bath, made of the
decoction of China, with Sarsaparilla and Sassafras; these are the remedies I
think proper for this worthy Gentleman. Gregorius Host, lib. 8. Observe. 15.

XVIII. Of Trembling and shaking.

1. This Disease is accompanied with two sundry movings: one is, while the
member, is constrained through heaviness and Grief to creep downwards: the
other is while the member is carried upward from his natural course and faculty.

2. This evil is caused altogether through weakness of the Sinews, which does
plainly decipher old age; but privately it comes of other causes, such as a
cold temperature of nature, cold drink taken either immoderately or out of
season, especially in Fevers; moreover the abundance of Cold, Gross and Clammy
humors, together with too great plenty of Wine unmixt, as also old age and fear
are the causes thereof.

3. There needs no signs to know either the evil or the causes of it; because
it may be known either by sight, or the Patients words, or the state of the
Body.

4. Let the Diet be so ordered, that it may be clean contrary to the causes of
the Disease, and let his Meat be such as will be easily digested and
distributed, such as Broths, Birds, and delicate kind of Fishes.

5. Against an abundance of gross and clammy humors; it is good to use those
things that have a power to divide, extenuate and cut, but he must avoid all
things which do hurt the Sinews, and chiefly the drinking of Wine that is
unmixed; he must drink Wine that is mixed with Water, or Hydromel, or Ale.

6. For the Cure, they which do Tremble or shake through some manifest error,
they must altogether abstain from things that are hurtful.

7. But if they do Tremble thorough drinking of Wine, until they by delivered
from the Disease, let them drink in the interim Hydromel with the decoction of
Sage and Betony.

8. If the shaking proceed from cold and and gross humors, then minister the
Cure which is ascribed for the Palsy and the Cramp, coming from Repletion
(letting of Blood only excepted.)

9. You must anoint the outward parts of the Body, with Oils that will heat,
and cover it with soft Wool, then fasten Cupping-glasses without scarification
from the first shutting of the Joints; which may be drawn to the outward part
of the skin, and so thereby humors may the easier be discussed and driven away.

10. Also it is good for the Sick to drink daily five grains of Pepper, with
one ounce and half of Mulse: there are moreover certain other simple Medicines,
which being taken do help Trembling, that is, Castoreum, root of Althea,
decoction of Agrimony, and the Brain of an Hare.

11. The Medicines and especially the Ointments which are prescribed for the
cure of the Palsy, are to be used here as remedies against this Disease.

SCHOLIA. The THEORY of a TREMOR or TREMBLING.
By the Author W. Salmon.
XIX. The Pathology of a Tremor or Trembling, and first of the notation thereof.

1. The Names. It is called in Greek (...), in Latin Tremor, and in English
Trembling or Shaking.

2. The Definition. Tremor est motus voluntarius depravatus, quo qui laborant,
membra libere movere, et propensa vel suspensa servare non possunt; sed membrum
a facultate animali in altum sublatum pondere suo deprimitur, iterumque a
faculte motrice erigitur. Trembling or shaking is a symptom of the hurt of the
Animal faculty, and depravation of the Motive, by reason of which the parts can
neither move freely, nor keep their station, being lift up by the moving
faculty, and then depressed downwards by their own weight, whence comes a
Trembling motion.

3. The kinds or differences. Although some make these as kinds or differences
of a Tremor, that it is either greater or lesser; Or, that it is either of the
whole Body, or of some particular part; yet that is the chief which depends
upon the causes, and accordingly to which the Cure is to be varied. And
therefore it is either Ideopathetick or Essential in the Brain, from a defect
or dissipation of the Spirits: Or Sympathetick, and by consent, from a
distemperature of the Nerves, being afflicted with cold and moisture, or
obstructed or compressed, and condensed or otherwise hurt with some venenate,
malign, narcotick, or occult quality. The chief or principal difference is,
that it is either simple or joined with a Convulsion, which latter is called
(...), of which Hippocrates (prognost. 10.) has made mention, which happens
sometimes not only in Fevers; but also in an Epilepsy, at the end of the
Paroxysm, where sometimes a Trembling joined with a convulsive motion, does
afflict the sick for some hours, to wit, till the Epileptick matter is wholly
dissipated.

XX. Of the signs of a Tremor or Trembling.

1. A Tremor superficially considred is evident to the sight, as whether it be
great or small, and whether it affl^cts the part or the whole; as also whether
it proceeds from any other affect, as a Palsy, Convulsion, Palpitation, Rigor;
or be joined with a convulsive motion.

2. This vicious Trembling is sometimes accompanied with cold and moisture of
the part; and sometimes with a continual and dry heat: and sometimes the parts
afflicted have a notable strength; and sometimes they are extremely Weak, so
that the Sick has not power to guide a Cup to their Mouth.

3. Moreover, the Disease is known to be Ideopathetick, or Essential in the
Brain, if no violent external cause went before, to overstrain or hurt the
extreme parts. In all such cases, the Disease is Sympathetical, and the Brain
only suffers by consent or compassion.

XXI. Of the causes of a Tremor or Trembling.

1. Authors have given many causes of Tremor or Trembling, which causes require
other causes to explain them: as, That it is caused by reason of the weakness
of the motive faculty, or nerest Instruments thereof, to wit, the Animal
Spirit, which is not able to exercise a voluntary motion perfectly. The Spirits
are made weak either by a fault in themselves, or by a defect in the Nerves,
which are the Condit-pipes of the Animal Spirits, and by which they are
conveyed and do act. The fault is in the Spirits, when either they are but few
at the first; Or, when they are afterward dissipated. They are few at the
first, either by reason of the cold distemper of the Brain, as in old men; Or,
for the want of Vital Spirits, which are the matter of which the Animal are
made. The Spirits are dissipated from many external causes as immoderate
evacuations, much use of venery and unseasonable, great Pain, much fasting,
Grief, and long violent Diseases. They are hurt by a defect in the Nerves; and
are weakened when either the Nerves are too cold, or are infected with a malign
quality, Or obstruction, Or compressed. They grow too cold either from cold
Air, Or the eating of cold Meats, Or much drinking of Water, Or swiming often
in cold water, and the like. They are infected by the use of Opium, Henbane,
Poppy, and the fumes of Mercury, as it often falls out to Goldsmiths and
Gilders, and to such as (having had the french Pox) have been cured with the
fumes of Cinnabar, Arsnick, or Mercury; as also to such as have had Malignant
Fevers. They are obstructed either wholly by some hurt, provocations or
irritation of the Nervous parts; Or in part, as in a Palsy, from a watery humor
gently spinkled upon the Nerves, producted from Gluttony, Drunkenness, and
other causes. Lastly, Trembling may come from compression of the Nerves, when
excrementitious humors abounding in the wholly Body do compress the Nerves, and
so hinders the free passage of the Animal Spirit. Thus Authors.

2. These are the common Opinions with which many learned Men have been
pleased: but we confess no way satisfy us, who have a mind wholly desirous to
investigate Truth. For if these be true causes, wherefore is it, that they
should be causes in one person, and not in another? for that we see in persons
where most of those supposed causes are previous and eminently manifest, not
one of an hundred are yet taken with a Tremor or Trembling? This thing to me
seems to argue a defect in the causes by Authors assigned, and that there is
yet the true cause hidden, which being stirred up, must infallibly produce the
Distemper: we shall therefore, in the first place discourse of the Procatartick
or Antecedent cause; then of the Proeguminine nere or conjunct cause, in order;
and that we hope with so much Perspicuity, plainness, and solid demonstration
of Truth, as may be satisfactory to all the lovers thereof.

3. The Procatartick, external or remote cause, is evidently manifest in all
such as have been affected with a Tremor or Trembling, from the bare relation
of the course of Life. In some great drinking of strong Liquors, as of strong
Beer, Ale, Wines, Brandy, etc. has been the Antecedent cause thereof, though we
confess that for once or twice, or now and than to be overcome with those
liquors, is not very material to the production thereof; yet the assiduous and
continual repeating of such a kind of intemperance, will in process of time
produce such an effect; so likewise Gluttony and Gormandising, thought more
rarely, unless the said intemperance be promoted to a vast excess, and also for
a long time repeated.

4. To these causes, we may add the force of Poison, and of Poisonous things, I
mean in those cases where their strength is not great enough to eradicate life.
I remember once upon design, an Acquaintance of mine, out of a Frolic gave one
drop of the Oil of Tobacco in a glass of Wine, to one of the company unknown to
them, but alas! upon a sudden how great an alteration was made, the Man's
countenance waxed pale, sickness at Stomach overtook him, a Trembling of the
whole Body; with fainting and swooning away, insomuch, (being ignorant of what
was don,) I almost dispaired of life; to these symptoms was added vomiting,
with vehement convulsive motions: after three hours the force of the Poison
vanished, but left behind it a Trembling of all the extreme parts, and a
palpitation of heart for ten or twelve days after. And other poisons effect the
same things, if not so speedily, or after the same manner, yet with as ill a
consequence, if not worse. One poisoned with Arsenick (though not mortally yet)
had such a Tremor left behind as the consequent and effects thereof, that
lasted during the Man's whole life. Another I knew poisoned with Nightshade,
who notwithstanding all the industry which was used by the Physicians, which
that place and time could afford, though he escaped with life, yet had a Tremor
which continued upon him for more than a year after it. And although I can
enumerate some who having been accidentally poisoned, have had yet no such
effects succeeding it, that may be imputed rather to their strong habit and
constitution of Body, or something which happily was taken in beforehand, which
so clothed the Nervous tunicles of the Stomach and other passages, as that it
could not so immediately have its effects, till such time as its greatest power
was lost in the passage through the Body.

5. Another Antecedent cause are the fumes of Cinnabar and Quicksilver, which
excite a Tremor after such an admirable, yet silent and insensible manner, that
it is not easy to apprehend the true reason thereof: and this is daily evident
in such as are Gilders, and deal much in Quicksilver, or daily handle it with
their Fingers: I have known some persons, who having been much concerned with
Quicksilver, that have been so enervated, and seized with such a Trembling
withal, that they have totally lost the use of all their Limbs: And indeed the
Fumes of Arsenick, and of other mineral Poisons being received up the Head by
the Nostrils have produced the same thing, to which sometimes other evil
symptoms have been added.

6. Another cause which we may lawfully assign, even from experience it self,
is sudden fear or joy, either of which being extreme, so profligate the Animal
Spirit, that suddenly it recovers not it self again. I knew a certain Merchant,
who upon the hearing of the loss of a Vessel in which he had a considerable
Cargo, was struck into such a consternation, that Immediately a Tremor seized
him all over from Head to Foot, nor was the Man scarcely himself: he continued
in this condition eight days and then died Trembling. Another being frighted,
with the apparition (as he thought) of some Demon or Ghost, was immediately
taken with such a Tremor, as lasted upon him a week or more. On the contrary?
an elderly Woman of about fifty six years of age, having a Son absent about
twenty two or twenty three years beyond Sea, coming home, and knocking at the
Door (she having no intelligence thereof before hand) her Son calling upon her,
and she knowing his voice, fell into such an Exstacy of Joy, which so enervated
her, that she could not hold one joint, nor yet speak plain to him: and in the
excess of this passion, being as it were infinitely transported with kindness,
suddenly Died. And I have known several others; who being transported with a
sudden excess of Joy, have been taken with a Tremor beyond imagination, which
has lasted many days.

7. Another eminent cause, and what is very common, are too violent vomits and
purges, which forcing nature beyond her strength, so profligate the Spirit, and
enervate the whole Man, that many times he is taken with such a weakness and
Trembling withal, that the force of no Cordial or restorative could be able to
retrieve the mischief in many weeks after: but as to this we shall say little
more; for that when Medicaments so much exceed the strength of nature, and in
stead of helping hurt her, they approach very near to the nature of Poison, and
act the part of an Enemy, not of a Friend: so that in this case, they may in a
manner be considered as Poisons, though not absolutely so in their own natures,
yet so in respect to their evil Effects consequent.

8. A Tremor sometimes also is caused from the excessive loss of Blood, whether
taken away by Accident or by Art. A young Woman (upon the supposition of a
Pleurisy) was twelve times let blood, and lost at those several times about two
hundred and twenty ounces of Blood, by means of which she was taken with such a
Tremor or Trembling, that with the greatest help of Art and Industry of the
Physician, which afterward attended her, she was not perfectly recovered out
of it in sixteen weeks time. A Soldier of about five and forty years of age,
was taken with an extreme Hemorrhage, so that he bleed about a quart, sometimes
three pints at a time, before the flux could be stopped; this bleeding being
often repeated, (though at last it was perfectly stopped, yet) left behind it
such a weekness and Tremor withal, as could never be taken away to his dying
day, although he lived above seven years after it with much Temperance and
Sobriety.

9. Sometimes it is caused in a Part, from the hurt of some of the Vessels
thereof by a prick, or cut or contusion, by means of which the animal Spirit is
in part frustrated or cut off; and this is when some principal Nerve, Tendon,
or Artery, or some, or all of them, are cut in sunder, or otherwise obstructed
with some heterogene matter whereby the flux of the animal Spirit is
frustrated, cut off, or turned aside, some other way: This is manifest in
several Persons who having been in the Wars, have met with variety of Wounds in
several Parts of their Bodies, which notwithstanding the dexterity of the
Artist's healing of them, have a manifold Tremor, as a perpetual Remembrance of
their former Adventures; though probably the said Tremor in some of them might
be caused partly through loss of Blood, and partly through the hurt of the
Vessels thereof.

10. Lastly a Tremor may be caused either in the whole Body, or in a part, from
an overstraining of the same, by some act of violence either of lifting,
thrusting, or pulling, beyond what Nature is able to bear: and though many
Examples of this kind are not easy to be produced, yet some such I have known;
but the error is seldom of long continuance, and easy to be retrieved.
Hitherto of the antecedent, procatartick, external or remote cause of this
disaffection; we come now to speak a word or two of the proeguminine, conjunct,
or nere cause.

11. Now strong Liquors, as Ale, Wine, Brandy, etc. contribute to this affect
by weakening both the animal Spirit and the Nerves: too much of any thing, as
the Proverb is, is good for nothing; the Sun is the Fountain of Light, yet
possibly by long gazing upon it, you may be made blind; the same it is in the
use of all spirituous and cordial Liquors; being taken in due measure and
proportion, they cheer the Heart and revive the Spirits, but taken to an
excess, they are so far from contributing to that end, that they wholly
overturn the Economy of Nature, especially being extravagantly and assiduously
used, for thereby such an intense heat is enkindled, as causes not only a
diffusion but also a dissipation of the animal Spirit; and by the vast quantity
which is continually poured in, the said Spirit is as it were overturned or
drowned, at least corrupted and weakened by being immersed in the heat and fumes
of the too abounding matter, whereby it is in part disabled for performing its
wonted operations.

12. Thus these Fumes from their intimate mixtion with the animal Spirit (also
corrupting of it) being conveyed thereby to the Brain and Cerebel, (the
Fountain of the said Spirit, and root of the nervous production) fall by means
thereof upon the Nerves, where, by too much opening of their constringed Pores
the said Nerves became relaxed, as it were and weakened, so that the animal
Spirit, which ought to be more strickly bound-up, becomes dilated and spread
abroad, and thereby the muscular Motion is either hurt or depraved. And this
must needs be, when the Spirit which is the prime or essential cause thereof is
contaminated, weakened, and dilated; and the Nerves which are the instrumental
cause of the said motion are watered as it were with a heterogene matter,
relaxed, and made unfit for the performance of their Functions.

13. And truly, not in a much different way do Poisons promote the same
disaffection, (but more dreadful in their Operation) for being received into
the Stomach, and being subtillised by the fermentative quality thereof; their
spiritual Parts separate themselves from the more earthy, and thereby make a
Conjunction with the animal Spirit; either mediately, by immersing themselves
in the Mass of Blood; or immediately, by insinuating themselves into the
nervous Tunicles of the Stomach; whence arises, besides the weakening,
contamination, and dilatation of the Spirit, and a relaxation and hurt of the
Nerves; a debility in the Stomach it self, with a hurt of its proper Functions;
by which the original matter for the generation of Spirit becomes both depraved
and diminished, which not a little contributes to the said relaxation; for
there being not a sufficient generation thereof, it follows that there must be
a deficiency in the Nerves, (the Channels and Condit-Pipes of the said Spirit,
and the proximate Instrument of muscular motion) whence a Tremor is immediately
excited.

14. Thus also the Fumes of mineral Poisons, being drawn up the Nostrils, and
penetrating the Brain, may more easily and immediately contaminate the animal
Fountain; from whence those fuliginous Vapors being conveyed over the whole
Genus Nervosum, or nervous System, not only foul and fully its Crystal-like
Streams, but confuse and obfuscate its limpid and translucid matter, corrupting
even the nervous Juice it self, the very support and stay of the Neurotick
Frame, thereby causing not only a relaxation of the substance of the Nerves and
diffusion of the Spirit out of its proper Current, but also many other evil
Symptoms besides.

15. But how this thing should sometimes come to pass, by the only handling of
Quicksilver, is yet more admirable, and deserves our farther consideration.
How easy it is for Quicksilver to insinuate it self into the Pores, and to
difuse it self into all Parts of the Body, especially the upper Parts, as the
Head and Brain, I think is sufficiently known almost to all: and that common
experiment of whitening Gold by treading of the naked Foot upon Quicksilver,
the Gold in the mean season being held in the Mouth; is something of
demonstration. By what Artifice the Mercury is conveyed to the Mouth, I will
not possitively determine; though it may be more than probably conjectured, its
Ascension might be by way of Fume: The whitening of the Gold is a proof of the
matter of fact: but if any should object, that the Gold attracted or drew up
the Mercury, and that if the Gold had not been held in the Mouth, the Mercury
would never have ascended: to this we answer; first, that the possibility of
the penetration of the Mercury is demonstrated from the whitening of the Gold,
whether the Gold attracted it or no. Secondly, that it is probable the Mercury
might have ascended to the Mouth and Head, as well without the Gold as with it;
only with this difference, that in its ascension, meeting with the Gold it
fixed there, whereas had the Gold been wanting, those particles of the Mercury
which fixed themselves upon the Gold, might have gone further, and have seized
the very Brain it self. Thirdly, that it has been confirmed by manifold
experience, that those who have frequently and long but handled Mercury, have
contracted such a Tremor, whereby they have wholly lost the use of their Limbs,
and the Affection incurable to boot; by which we think the matter is beyond
dispute.

16. How a sudden consternation by Fear, or Ecstasy of Joy, should produce such
an effect is yet more worthy our inquiry. Truly these are Passions which first
fix themselves in the apprehension, and thereby breed a perturbation of the
animal Spirit, but immediately seize and exercise their fury upon the Heart,
and Vitals. And here, in both cases the Heart is dilated or as it were opened,
and the Blood and Spirits by a certain flux enter it, in the first case, by
filling it, to support and fortify it as much as may be against the danger of
the evil appendent: in the second case, to augment and maintain the fullness of
the Joy co^ceived, which flux being vehement and immeasurable, leaves the
extreme Parts of the Body destitute as it were, whereby being deprived of great
part of their nourishment and support, a feebleness immediately seizes upon
them, and a Tremor forth with, as a consequent thereof; for being thereby
emptied in part, a diffusion of the remainingt part of he Spirit is made,
whence follows a forceable relaxation of the Nerves. Now when this is extreme
or vehement from the magnitude of the Joy and Fear, the flux of the Blood and
Spirits being more impetuous, or greater than the dilatation of the Heart,
whereby it is unable to receive all that are sent on that occasion, hence it is
that oftentimes not only a Tremor but a Suffocation immediately follows, and a
t^tal extinction of the vital Flame. For as the Flame of a Lamp is nourished
and maintained by the Oil which continually feeds it, yet will that Flame be
extinguished by a suffocation thereof, through an afflux of too much Oil
drowning the same, as well as by a detention or with holding of its proper
nourishment.

17. Hence also the reason is apparent how the loss of Blood should produce the
near cause thereof: for if a Tremor be immediately produced from a large
D^ffusion, Dilatation, Dissipation, Diminution or loss of Spirits; it is
evident, that it must also follow upon the loss of Blood, for that the Blood is
the Vehiculum of he vital Spirit, the progenitor of the animal; and according
to the diminution of the Blood, such (in proportion) is the diminution of the
Spirit: which being largely taken away, must necessarily leave a feebleness and
weakness upon the Parts from whence it is detracted, thereby disabling them for
performing their wonted Functions.

18. Now that Tremor which follows from a hurt or puncture of the Nerve, is
caused from compression, wherein the animal Spirit is stopped or straightned in
its course or flux, and so is forced out of its domicil; by means of which
diffusion, a dilatation and relaxation of the Nerve ensues, causing a weakness
and feebleness of the Part, whereby it is incapable of perforing of its
Functions; and in this case sometimes a numbness and want of feeling goes a long
with it, which in a proper Sense can be nothing but a Palsy of the Part, of
which in the next Chapter we shall largly treat.

19. So likewise there is made an ex^eeding compression of the Nerves, when
they are vehemen^ly extended or strained by Force, beyond their natural
Composure, whereby the Channels of the animal Spirit are straightned or made
narrower, and so forced to diffuse it self into the adjacent fleshy Parts;
whence it comes to pass, that as soon as there is a relaxation of the
extension, there is also a relaxation of the Nerve, which being defective in
Spirits is immediately weakened and taken with a Tremor. But this, as we said
before, seldom lasts long, for that there being no real obstruction in the
Organ, there is in short time a new supply of Spirits, whereby the hurt
occasioned by the Force is again repaired.

XXII. Of the Prognostics of a Tremor or Trembling.

1. A Tremor proceeding from watching, want of eating or drinking, two much
exercise, light fear or joy, or distemper of the mind, is for the most part
without danger, and when the causes cease, it ceases.

2. A Tremor coming from an internal cause, although of it self it is not
mortal, or otherwise dangerous: yet it is apt to degenerate into an Apoplexy,
Lethargy, Convulsion or Palsy, whereby it becomes the more perilous.

3. The more vehement the Tremor is, and in the more noble Parts, so much it is
the more evil; and the longer its continuance, so much the more doubtful is the
Cure: and if it be on the left side (according to Avicen) it is yet the more
evil, for that it is observed that the innate heat of those Parts, more easily
fails or is diminished.

4. A Tremor in old Persons is seldom or never cured, because of the great
imbecility of the Brain and animal Spirit, and for the most part it ends in
Death.

5. An hereditary Tremor, or that which comes from long drinking of vast
quantities of Wine, Brandy, and other errors of Diet, more especially in those
who have by nature the Organs of the animal Spirit very weak, are very seldom
cured: and they either remain in the same state, or it increases upon them with
Age.

6. If a Tremor degenerates into a Convulsion it is dangerous, and for the most
part mortal, unless the Convulsion can be suddenly removed; for that (as some
think) there follows a great exsiccation of the nervous Parts, whereby the free
afflux of the Spirit is prejudiced, and from the privation of which an opposite
habit is begot.

7. A Tremor in a burning Fever, often presages a Delirium; for by reason of
the ardent heat, whereby the Blood is inflamed, gross Vapors are mixed with
the Spirits in the Brain and Cerebel, whence comes a confusion and hurt of the
Senses, which is not without danger.

8. A convulsive Trembling in the extreme Parts, chiefly in the Hands is
dangerous, and so much the more if it be attended with a Consumption of the
whole Body.

9. A Tremor in a slow, long or lingering Fever is less dangerous: but in a
vehement burning and acute Fever it is not without peril; and in this case if
a Delirium follows with a Convulsion it is mortal.

10. A Tremor in a Phrensy and Melancholy, arising from yellow choler changed
into Atrabilis, is very dangerous, if not mortal, because of the malign quality
of the humors, (as Hippocrates in Coacis testifies) which are inimical to the
original of the Nerves and the whole Genus Nervosum.

11. A Tremor happening to a Woman in Childbed, by reason of the Secundine or
Afterbirth, is of very evil consequence; for it signifies a putrefaction and
malignity of the humors, which contaminate the animal, and suffocate the vital
Spirits.

12. A Tremor happening in an Apoplexy or Lethargy is very dangerous: so also if
it comes from emptiness, or extreme evacuation, whereby the Spirit is exhausted
and diminished, and the natural heat dissipated and at length abolished. A
Trembling of the lower Lip, presages vomiting to be at hand.

XXIII. The Therapia, or Method of cure of a Tremor or Trembling.

1. In order to the cure of this Disease we must have respect to the causes: 1.
The Procatartick or external causes ought in the first place to be removed: 2.
The Matter generating the vital and animal Spirits ought to be augmented: 3.
The Brain, Cerebel, and Genus Nervosum, ought to be corroborated and
strengthened: 4. The Body and the fleshy Parts if emaciated and wasted, ought to
be restored and conserved.

2. If therefore the external or remote cause of a Tremor shall proceed from
great drinking of Wine, Brandy, or any other external cause or causes before
enumerated; to which the sick has been accustomed, they ought immediately to be
removed, for otherwise, what ever we shall do to promote the Cure will be in
vain. But whereas we forbid those to drink Wine, Brandy, etc. whose Disease has
been caused thereby, yet by reason the sudden, abrupt, and total prohibition of
those Liquors, might be of immediate evil consequence, we must prescribe
something else, to be used in stead thereof. And therefore in stead of the
Liquor to which the sick has been accustomed, let him drink Hydromel,
Metheglin, or Mead, but with great moderation and temperance.

3. Or in stead thereof he may take this: Take Hydromel or Mead, twelve quarts:
Betony, Sage, Rosemary, of each four handfuls: sweet Marjoram, Pennyroyal,
Mint, of each one handful: bruise and infuse four and twenty hours, then boil
gently one hour, cool, strain, let it settle, decant off the clear, and bottle
it up, with two Cloves split and put into each Bottle. Or thus: Take fair
Water, fifteen quarts: white Sugar, seven or eight pounds: pure Sal Prunellae,
an ounce and half: dissolve all together in the Water, and make it boil for an
hour, being almost co^^, work it up with Aleyest; putting into it in a Bag,
with a Stone in it, and these following things. Take Coriander-seed, Sage,
Rosemary, Marjoram, Pennyroyal, Mint, of each four ounces: Ginger bruised,
Juniper Berries, Bawm, of each three ounces: Jamaica-Pepper, Anacardiums, of
each two ounces: Cloves, Nutmegs, ^f each one ounce: bruise what are to be bru
s^d, and let them work in the Liquor two or three or four days: the working
being over, let it stand to grow fine two or three weeks, or till you see it is
very pure and clear, then bottle it up, and let the sick take it moderately, as
their c^nstant drink.

4. If the Disease proceeds from any venene or poisonous cause, you must give
such things as are Antidotes against the Poison and Malignity. If it proceeds
from pestilential Poison, you may give this following: Take Extracts of
Saffron, Contrayerva, Virginian snake-root, Gentian, Zedoary, of each an ounce:
Castoreum in fine Powder, five drams: Bezoar oriental, two drams and half:
Musk, one dram: Juice of Alkerns, a sufficient quantity to make it into a soft
Electuary: of this the sick may take the quantity of a Hazel-nut or Nutmeg
three times a day, viz. Morning, Noon, and Night, drinking after the same, a
little glass of one of the former Liquors. If the Patient be strong, and the
Malignity be great, it will be necessary to cause a gentle sweat, which you may
perform with this: Take Philonum Romanum, two drams: volatile Salt of
Hartshorn, fifteen grains: Musk, ten grains: mix them for a Dose: let it be
given at bedtime, and let the sick drink after it. If the sick cannot swallow
an Electuary; you may give a Dose of our Laudanum, and so much the more if a
Delirium, Phrensy, or Convulsion be feared. Or this following Mixture: Take of
the prepared Metheglin above prescribed, a quarter of a pint: of our Guttae
Vitae, thirty or forty drops: Spirit of Vipers, sixty drops: mix them for a
Dose: this will sweat powerfully, and expel all the poison, venom, and
malignity of the Disease to a Miracle. And these things may be of good use, let
the venene cause be what it will.

5. But if it be caused from Poison (whether vegitable, mineral, or animal)
immediately received into the Stomach, you must forthwith give a Vomit, that
the matter of the Poison may with all possible speed be evacuated: for this
purpose I commend my vomiting Lozenges, which you may give from a scruple to
half a dram, or the Aqua Benedicta Rulandi, Infusion of Vitrum Antimonii, and
such like: If these things be not to be had you may give (except it be a
mineral Poison) a large draught of Salle^-Oyl, and then presently after provoke
vomiting by a Feather put into the Throat. This done, and the danger of the
Poson being over, you shall then exihibite some proper Antidote, that the very
relics of the Poison may be obliterated; and for this purpose, you may either
give some of those above mentioned at 4. Or this following: Take
Venice-Treacle, Extract of Saffron, of each a dram: Salt of Vipers, eight
grains: mix them for a Dose to be given about three hours after the vomiting is
over.

6. If it be caused from the Poison of Quicksilver, or other mineral Fume, you
must use preparations of Gold, as Aurum potabile, Tincture of Gold, Sulphur of
Gold, and other the like Medicaments: but if these cannot be gotten, you must
give preparations of Gold and Mercury, such as are the Aurum Vitae of
Sennertus, Hercules Bovii, and the like; for these things being given gradually
and for a long time, take away at length the contamination of the vital juyces,
and free the neurotick Frame from the morbifick Poison: after the use thereof
for some time, you may then give Sudorificks made of Minerals, such as this
following: Take of our Electuarium ad Tabidos, one dram: Bezoarticum minerale,
oue scruple: Extract of Saffron, ten grains, mix them for a Dose: after which
give a glass of generous Wine, or of the former preparation of Hydromel, and
dispose the sick for a Sweat. This Dose you may repeat three or four times,
giving it every other day.

7. If it should proceed from Surfeiting or Gluttony, it would be good to
evacuate the Stomach upward: to Children and weak Persons you may give the Sal
Vitrioli from a scruple to a dram: stronger Persons may take the Emetick Tartar
of Minsicht to four five or six grains: Or you may give our Catharticum
Argenteum from a dram to two drams according to age and strength, for that
evacuates admirably both upwards and downwards, and the latter especially if it
be given with a little salt Broth. These emetick purgations may be two or three
times repeated, according as you see occasion, or the strength of the sick will
bear: but if the sick be very weak, you must be cautious of giving of strong
Evacuaters, lest you add to the Disease, and make the Tremor or Trembling so
much the worse, by an unfit diminution of the Spirits.

8. The second Indication is for the generating of vital and animal Spirits,
which is performed by such things as abound with volatile Parts, and nutriments
full of Spirits. For this purpose we commend strong Jellies made of the juice
of Oxes Hearts, Sheeps Hearts, and Jellies made of the flesh of Fouls, chiefly
of wild Foul, which Jellies ought to be strong, and mixed with a little Wine,
and aromatized with Spices to be made grateful to the Stomach: But if the
Tremor come through drinking of Wine or Brandy, then in stead of mixing of
Wine, you ought to mix Mead or some small portion of the Diet before mentioned,
for thereby the Nutriment is the better and more easily assimulated, and the
chylous juice more absolute for the generating of pure and spirituous Blood.

9. But that which in this case we shall commend above all these things, is the
Jelly or Broth of Vipers, which after a most admirable manner, augments,
comforts, and fortifies the Spirits, of what kind soever. The same thing does
the Viper-Pouder, and the flesh of Vipers, being boiled and eaten as you eat
Eels or other Fish. To these things add the Salt and Spirit of Vipers, as also
the Potestates Viperarum, which Medicament we cannot easily nor enough commend.
The volatile Salt and Spirit of Earthworms is of good use here, as also the
Spirit of shell-Snails, and the Jelly and Spirit distilled from a Deers-Head:
Or a Jelly made of a fresh Deers-Head, beaten all into a mash, with a Spirit
drawn from other Heads.

10. Now this is to be noted, that whatsoever things are given which are
spirituous, they ought always to be mixed with such other things as breed a
good Chyle; for from a generous Chyle is generated a good and spirituous Blood,
and of the Blood elaborated in the Heart is made the vital Spirit, which
Spirit, elaborated in the Brain, produces that which we call the animal Spirit,
which being disseminated through the whole Genus Nervosum is that which gives
Sense and Motion to all the Parts of the whole Body.

11. But lest these things should not be so well accomplished as may be
desired, you must have respect to the Stomach, that its Tone be preserved
entire and free from hurt: for if there be a weakness of the Stomach or any
other hurt or indisposition, you must be sure to remove those Symptoms
(according as we shall hereafter teach in their proper Chapters) or else you
act in vain. For a simple weakness of the Stomach, you may give the Tincture of
black Pepper, of Centory the less, of Wormwood, or the Elixir Proprietatis,
any of which may be given the sick from fifteen to twenty, thirty or forty
drops in a glass of Ale or Metheglin; and that three four or six times a day,
or more, or as often as the sick has occasion to drink. But if there be a
preternatural heat conjoined, by which also the Spirits are much wasted, then
in stead of the former things, you must give Spir^t or Oil of Vitriol, or Salt,
or Sulphur, or the Acetum Antimonii, or Juice of Limons, which may be
constantly mixed with their drink as aforesaid: Yet if a sowrness by adjoined,
then volatile and alcalious Salts are to be administered, and the acid avoided:
Or else you may profitably give Tartar vitriolate, which grows sweet in the
Stomach, and although sour, takes away all manner of Acidities, and withal
cools the unnatural heat (which wastes the Spirits) to a wonder, and by its
gratefulness strengthens the Stomach singularly. What we might say more as to
this matter, shall be referred to the Chapters of Weakness and Distempers of
the Stomach, hereafter to be treated of; We now come to our third Indication.

12. The third Intention is to strengthen the Brain, Cerebel, and Genus
Nervosum, which is done either by exhibition of Internals, or application of
Topics. For this purpose Sage, and Castoreum are commended as also Goats-Rue
and Arabian Staechas, which may be given one dram at a time in Hydromel: but
the Potestates or Powers of those things transcend, and may be also given in
Hydromel or Cinnamon Water from twenty to forty or sixty drops, or in Conserves
of Primroses, Bawm, Rosemary-Flowers, or Ac^rus, or other things of like kind.
The Powers of Rosemary and of Lavender given in like manner prevail much.
Avicenna commends the Brains of a Hare roasted, but above all things Castoreum,
as the most admirable thing in the World.

13. But more particularly to comfort the Brain and Genus Nervosum, this
follow^ng is by Sennertus advised: Take Pulp of the flesh of wild Pigeons, or
of a Magpie or a Stork, being boiled in Wine, three ounces: the Brains of a
Hare roasted, one ounce: sweet Almonds blanched, number thirty: fresh Pine-Nuts
washed in Hydromel, number twenty: blew Currants, one ounce: Species of the
Electuarium Resumptivum, two drams: Pulvis Cinnamoni, three drams: Ginger,
Cloves, Mace, Galangal, of each one scruple: Cardamums, half a scruple: Musk,
two grains: clarified Honey, a sufficient quantity: mix and make an Electuary,
Or this: Take Conserves of the Flowers of Rosemary, Lavender, and Sage, of each
half an ounce: Electuarium Diacori, six drams: brains of a Hare roasted, one
ounce: Castoreum, half a dram: Mans-skull prepared, two drams: Pouders of the
roots and seeds of Peony, of each one dram: Misleto of the Oak, half a dram:
Spirit of Primroses or Cowslips, one dram: Essentia Salis, half a dram: with
Syrup of Staechas, a sufficient quantity make an Electuary.

14. Or this: Take Conserves of Betony and Rosemary, of each an ounce and half:
green Ginger, six drams: Species Diamoschi, Diambrae, of each half a dram:
Venice-Treacle, two drams: Aureae Alexandrinae, half a dram: volatile Salt of
Vitriol, one scruple: with Syrup of Betony a sufficient quantity make an
Electuary. Or this: Take Conserves of Acorus, and of the Flowers of Rosemary
and Sage, of each two ounces, Mans-skull prepared, half an ounce: roots and
seeds of Peony, roots of Water-Plantain, of each one dram and half: the Brains
of a Hare roasted, two ounces: mix and make an Electuary.

15 But these things following are more powerful. The Potestates Virtutum,
given from twenty to forty or sixty drops in Canary or Spirit of black
Cherries, Morning, Noon, and Night. Or this: Take Powers of Rosemary, of
Lavender, of Sage, of Savin, of Mans-skull, of each one ounce: Powers of sweet
Marjoram, of musked Cranes Bill, of Time, of each half an ounce: Powers of Musk
and Ambergrise, of each six drams: mix them: Dose from twenty to forty drops or
more, in any convenient Vehicle. Powers of Cinnamon given alone in Canary or
Metheglin, are of admirable use; Or this mixture: Take Powers of Cinnamon, two
ounces: Powers of Nutmegs, Powers of Cloves, of each half an ounce: rectified
Spirit of black Cherries, of Earthworms, and of Lavender, of each three drams:
mix them all together. Dose from thirty to sixty drops in Canary.

16. This following Powder is of good use: Take Peacocks-Dung, flesh of
Swallows thoroughly dried, Mans-skull levigated, of each one ounce: Musk, six
drams: Ambergrise, half an ounce: Powder of Cloves and Cinnamon, of each two
drams: Bezoar oriental and mineral, of each one dram: all being in fine Powder,
mix them together: Dose from ten grains to one scruple, and in some cases to
half a dram: Or this: Take Powder of Mans-skull, and of Musk, of each half an
ounce: Ambergrise, Salt of Hartshorn and of Amber, of each two drams: Salt of
Vipers, one dram: mix them: Dose from eight to sixteen grains. Or this: Take
Mans-skull levigated, Swallows, and flesh of Storks dried and poudred, Powder
of Vipers, of each one ounce: Salt of Hartshorn, Tartar vitriolate, of each
half an ounce, mix them: Dose forty grains.

17. This Electuary following is singular: Take Electuarium and Tabidos,
Venice-Treacle, of each two ounces: Peacock-Dung, one ounce. Salt of
Mans-skull, Musk, of each half an ounce: volatile Salt of Swallows, volatile
Salt of Amber, of each two drams: with juice of Alkermes, a sufficient
quantity: mix and make an Electuary. Dose one scruple or half a dram. Or this:
Take Mithridate, Electuarium de Ovo, of each two ounces: Powder of the roots
and seeds of Peony, Powder of Vipers, and of Swallows of each one ounce: Salt
of Amber and of Mans-skull, of each half an ounce: Oils of Rosemary, Lavender,
Sage, and sweet Marjoram, of each twenty five drops: juice of Alkermes, a
sufficient quantity: mix and make an Electuary. Or this: Take Venice-Treacle,
three ounces: Oriental Bezoar, Bezoar mineral, volatile Salt of Amber, of each
one ounce fine Powder of an Elks hoofs, and of Ox-horns, of each half an ounce:
Spirit or Powers of Vipers, six drams: with juice of Alkermes, a sufficient
quantity: make an Electuary: Dose one scruple or half a dram Morning and
Evening.

18. Authors prepare a syrup after this manner: Take leaves of Primroses or
Cowslips, of Sage, Rue, Ground Pine, Marjoram, Germander, Savory, Calamint,
Origanum, Betony, of each half a handful: Calamus Aromaticus, half an ounce:
boil them in water or Mead, and with a sufficient quantity, of Honey make a
syrup, in which while hot hang the following Nodulus, letting it remain
therein: Take Cinnamon, Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs, black and long Pepper, Ginger,
Spicknard, Aniseeds and Peony-seeds, of each one dram: make all into a powder,
and tie it up in a Rag. This following syrup is better: Take syrup of the juice
of Alkermes, twenty ounces: Spirits of Angelica, of Rosemary and of Castoreum,
of each three ounces: Powers of Cinnamon, of Musk, and of Ambergrise, of each
an ounce and half: mix them. Dose half a spoonful Morning, Noon, and Night,
drinking after it a little glass of good Mead, or Black-Cherry Wine.

19. Nicolas Florentinus, Sermon. 3. To. 3. cap. 9. says, That a certain Woman
sixty years of Age, was delivered from a Tremor of the Head only by eating the
flesh of a night Raven, being skinned, exviscerated and so boiled. The Essence
of Bawm given in Basil water is in good estimation: so also a strong Tincture
of Sage leaves made in rectified spirit of Wine: to these things add Tincture
of Wormwood, Tincture of Myrrh, Elixir proprietatis, with other things of like
nature. Moreover some learned Men say, That nothing profits more, than a
decoction of Lignum Guajacum, and Sarsaparilla being drank for some days, for
that it drys up excrementitious humors, or evacuates them by sweating.

20 We now come to the Application of Topics, which may warm, comfort,
strengthen, and corroborate the Nerves: for which purpose. Authors commend
these things, viz. Oils of Costus, of Foxes, of Castor, of Earthworms, of
Turpentine, of Bricks, of Pepper, of Spicknard, of Juniper, and of white
Lillys; in which flowers of Lavender, of Lillys-Convally, and of Rosemary have
been infused or digested. Moreover there is commended an Oil made of the
flowers of Trefoil, and of Cowslips; with which, or some of the former, the
Neck and Original of the Nerves, as also the Trembling members are to be
Morning and Night anointed, also you may bath them with Apoplectick,
Epileptick, and Cephalic Waters.

21. This folloing is prescribed by Sennertus: Take Oils of Juniper Berries, of
Castoreum, of Pepper, and of Foxes, of each half an ounce: Vnguentum Martiatum,
one ounce and half: Venice Soap, one ounce: powder of the seeds of Rocket, of
Onions, of Rue, and of Nettles, of each one dram: Goose or Ducks grease, one
ounce and half: mix them for an Ointment. A Balsam made also of Rosemary,
Lavender, Sage, Petroleum, and the distilled Oils of Juniper Berries, Marjoram,
and Bawm, is of singular use. The Trembling Members may also be washed sometimes
with a hot decoction of Sage, Rosemary, Lavender, Marjoram, Juniper Berries,
and Castoreum; to every quart of which, (at time of using of it) you may put
two ounces of Spirit of Wine, or about three ounces of Aniseed water. Some
commend the hot Baths, but chiefly such as are from Sulphur mines; if such
cannot be had with convenience, you may prepare a Laconick Bath, or a bath of
Herbs, as aforesaid.

22. Some commend this following distilled water for a secret: Take green or
fresh leaves of Sage, one pound: Camphir one ounce: white Wine a sufficient
quantity: digest for eight days; then distill in Balneo, according to Art, and
with the Water bath the Trembling parts. Or this: Take Mastich, Frankincense,
Myrrh, Opopanax, Sagapenum, of each three drams: styrax Calamita and Liquid, of
each half an ounce: Turpentine, two ounces: Gout-Jvy, flowers of
Lilly-Convally, and of Lavender, of each a handful and half: cut and bruise
them, and affuse thereon Rhenish Wine two pound: let all stand in digestion in
a warm place f^r four days, then let it be distilled: and in the distilled
liquor dissolve, one dram of choice Musk. with their liquor let the nape of the
Neck, and Spina dorsi, and members affected be anointed.

23. These Oils and Ointments prescribed by Authors are very greasy and
loathsome to the sick, we will prescribe things more delicate, curious and neat,
and yet more effectual. The Powers of Amber, alone supply the place of all
these things, and will do more than all, either apart or conjoined: if the Head
be taken with a Tremor, or if the cause of the Tremor be Essential in the Head,
let the Hair be shaved off, and then let it be well bathed with the said Powers
of Amber, and this may be don Morning and Night for a week or ten days, keeping
the Head very warm bound up after it, at the end of that time you may apply the
Emplaster of Franciscus Valesius against Epilepsies, which you may see in the
former Book, letting it lie on four or five days, and then renewing of it, and
repeating the same six or seven times: Or this, in the place thereof, if that
cannot be had: Take fat Myrrh in fine powder, one ounce: make it very soft with
rectified Spirit of Wine: and mix therewith choice Venice Treacle, two ounces:
Oil of Rosemary and of Amber, of each twenty drops: being all well mixed,
spread it upon Leather and apply it over the whole Head, it being first close
shaved. With those Powers of Amber, you ought also to bath the whole Spina
dorsi or Backbone, from the Nucha to the Os Coccigis Morning and Night, and
that for ten or twelve days, as also in like manner all the Trembling parts.

24. Or instead of the Powers of Amber, you may use this which may be something
more effectual: Take Powers of Oranges and Limons, of each two ounces: Powers
of Sassafras and Savin, of each one ounce: Powers of Rosemary, of Sage, of
Caraways, and of Amber, of each half an ounce: mix them to bath with all as
aforesaid: where note, that if the sick delight in sweet things you may add to
the former Composition the Powers of Musk, and Ambergrise, of each six drams:
with which the said parts as also the Temples and Nostrils ought to be bathed.

25. After the parts affected have been bathed with the said powers for ten or
twelve days or more, or till the said Tremor is taken away, if there then
remains a weakness in the said members, you ought to apply things of a
strengthing nature: first, for some few days, you may bath with the Tincture of
Myrrh: which done you may apply this: Take Mithridate or Venice Treacle, three
or four ounces: fine Myrrh in powder (dissolved in rectified spirit of Wine)
one ounce and half: two yolks of Eggs: mix and make a Cataplasm, which spread
upon Leather and apply, renewing it once in two or three days, and repeating
the same for three weeks or more as you see occasion: but before the
application of each Cataplasm, it will be good to bath the part well with the
Powers of Amber.

26. If the Tremor proceeds from Quicksilver, there ought to be mixed with the
internal Medicaments before mentioned some choice preparation of Gold, as Aurum
potabile, volatile Calx of Gold, or Sulphur or Tincture of the same; Sennertus
advises to the use of the crude powder of Gold (made of the leaves being very
subtle and fine,) and that both Internally and Externally, which are to be
taken mixed with some other proper thing: for by this means he thinks the
Quicksilver will be imbibed by the Gold, and so being united, will be both cast
forth by stool.

27. Some say also that Quicksilver and its Poison may be over come by a
Sudorifick Course, wherein, it shall so adhere to the skin like small Sand, and
may be washed off with Water: for this purpose the sick ought to be put every
other day into a dry Bath: the best is Hartmans Chair, which may be made of a
convenient heat by firing in the same the most pure rectified Spirit of wine:
The Sweat may also sometimes be absolved by Frankincense or Olibanum, cast upon
live Char-cole (though in my opinion that with Spirit of Wine is much the
better) and this sweating course ought to be repeated at least fourteen times.
During the time of the sweating, the sick ought to be comforted, and his
Spirits supported with some pleasing Cordial, such as this following: Take
Cinnamon Water of the best, Aqua Caelestis, of each two ounces: Rosewater, one
ounce: syrup of Citron peels, an ounce and half mix them. Of this let the sick
take a spoonful now and than during the time of sweating.

28. After the sweating is over the Trembling members may be anointed with
Venice Treacle mixed with Oleum Irinum, or Oil of Bays; or bathed with
Aniseed-water, which comforts and nourishes the Nerves; Or with this of
Sennertus his prescription: Take Camels Hay, Cyperus, Acorus, Spicknard,
Nutmegs, Cloves, Pepper, of each two drams: Hermodactils, Satyrion, of each one
dram: Spirit of Wine, or Aqua Apoplectica, one ounce: Wax a sufficient
quantity, melt, mix, and make a Liniment, but that which goes beyond all these
things, are the Powers of Aniseeds, which by a certain kind of Specific
virtue, corroborate the weakened Nerves. Some also highly commend the Balsam of
Sulphur, being anointed down the whole Backbone, and upon the parts afflicted
with the Tremor, and that this will be so much the more effectual, if the said
fine powder of leaf Gold be mixed therewith.

29. The fourth and last Intention is to restore (if need be) the emaciated or
wasted body. This may well be performed by many things prescribed in the second
Intention of Cure, seeing that those things which restore and recuperate the
humane nature, also breed Spirits. The first thing which I shall here recommend
for this purpose is the Electuarium ad Tabidos, being taken Morning, Noon, and
Night, about an hour before eating, to the quantity of a large hasle nut at
each time.

30. The Gelly of Vipers flesh is admirable for this Intention, nor is there
scarcely a better thing in nature, so also the flesh eaten boiled or baked: but
for such as cannot attain it you must give other things, as the Spirit and
broth of Earthworms, with the Tincture of black Pepper, which is no mean
thing: Or you may make the Tincture of the said Pepper with the said Spirit of
Earthworms, which you may give in Milk, or in all his drink, and Morning and
Night you may give this following Electuary: Take Venice Treacle, one dram, to
one dram and half: powder of Earthworms, one scruple to half a dram: of Our
Laudanum, from one grain to two grains: Oil of Cinnamon, one or two drops: mix
for a dose to be given every, Night going to bed. Or thus: Take Venice Treacle,
two ounces: powder of Earthworms, powder of Vipers, oriental Bezoar, Bezoar
mineral, of each half an ounce to six drams: Oil of Cinnamon, one dram: mix
them, and with juice of Alkermes, a sufficient quantity make an Electuary. Dose
one dram to two drams, Morning and Night. Or thus: Take Venice Treacle, Extract
of Sarsaparilla, of each two ounces: Scorzonera roots candied, Indian green
Ginger candied, Citron peels candied, of each one ounce and half: powder of
Vipers, and Earthworms, of each three ounces: Pistich nuts, number eighty:
beat all together in a mortar and with the syrup Diacodium a sufficient
quantity, make an Electuary according to art, adding at last Oil of Cinnamon,
one dram and half: Dose two drams, two or three times a Day.

CHAP. III. Of the PALSY.
The AUTHORS Observations.
I. A Palsy in a middle aged Man, of a gross body, with a vehement Catarrh.

1. THis Person being about forty three years of age, And of a Gross fat,
pituito^s habit of body, was taken with a Paralytick Distemper, in all his
Extreme parts, which was thought to be first caused from taking of an extreme
cold; there was a numbness almost all over him, together with a very great
Tremor or Trembling, which was continual and equal, but without any manner of
Pain.

2. This Gentleman had been under the Hands of several Physicians, for two or
three years together, but could receive no benefit, so that he gave himself
over to despair, having indeed passed through all the ordinary courses of
Physic: at length some of his Relations persuaded him to make use of me; I was
accordingly sent for, they gave me a relation of all that had passed, and
requested my care for the future.

3. All the things, and the whole course which had been used to him, during all
this time had been wholly Galenical, so that I did not wonder that no success
had attended the same. I therefore proceeded as follows, first I caused his
Body to be effectually purged with my Family Pills with Aloes, and repeated the
same eight or nine times, with fit intervalls, three four or five days being
sometimes between. And by reason he complained of an exceeding sickness and
weakness of his Stomach, so that he could scarcely digest any Food that he
took, I prescribed this following Electuary to be taken three times a day for
ten days, an hour before eating: Take Diatesseron, two ounces: Powers of
Pepper, forty drops, mix them, dose twenty grains.

4. Moreover, I ordered him to take the Tincture of black Pepper, thirty forty
or sixty drops at a time, or as much as he could conveniently bear in all the
drink he took, by means of which the great indisposition of his Stomach became
rectified, and he began now to digest his Food much beter than formerly.

5. I also gave him of the volatile Spirits of Vitriol, and Sulphur, in Wine
sometimes, and sometimes in Mead or Ale, for change sake, the use of which he
continued for nere twelve weeks: he took from twenty to forty drops at a time,
according as he could bear it, and by this he was very much relieved, and the
Head and Stomach, with the whole Nervous system was very much comforted and
restored.

6. His purging being completely over, I caused him to sweat well, which was
don sometimes in Hartmans Chair with Powers of Rosemary, of Oranges and Limons,
of each a like quantity mixed together: and sometimes in Bed with this following
sudorifick dose: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, one dram: Bezoar mineral, one
scruple: mix them and give it, drinking after it a small glass of Sack. This
was repeated about ten times at four days distance: the sick sweat well, and
after the sixth time sweating, the numbness of the parts went quite away.

7. By the use of these things the Catarrh was much abated, but not wholly
taken off for which reason I ordered him to take constantly the following
Electuary for some time: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, two ounces: Our new
London-Treacle, one ounce: mix them. Dose from half a scruple to one scruple. I
caused his Head to be shaved, and applied over the whole Cranium (being first
very well bathed with the Powers of Rosemary, The Emplastrum Cephalicum of the
shops.

8. But this not wholly removing the Catarrh, I prescribed him my volatile
Laudanum, to be taken every Night going to bed the last thing. he began with
two grains, and once in a weeks time we increased the Dose a grain, so long
till he took about twelve grains of it at a time, which had so good an effect
upon him, that by the assiduous use thereof, this vehement Catarrh was
perfectly removed.

9. What this Laudanum is and how prepared, We have taught in Our Chemistry now
in the Press: But that we may not wholly detain or withhold from you, so long
the knowledge of that so excellent a Medicament, we will here briefly declare
the Composition and Preparation thereof, a remedy in my opinion superior to all
others of that kind yet made use of or known in the World.

10. Laudanum Volatile Nostrum: Take of the best Thebian Opium, thirty ounces:
make it into an Extract of a middle consistence, with Spirit of Wine; and mix
therewith ten ounces of the best Venice Treacle: being well mixed add thereto
Volatile Salt of man's Skull, of Hartshorn, of Sal Armoniack, of Amber, of
Tartar, and of Vipers, of each one ounce: mix them well in a wooden mortar, and
keep them some days, then add, Extract of Virginian Snake root, of Contra
yerva, of Zedoary, of Saffron, of Castoreum, of Mithridate, of each two ounces
and a half: Chemical Oils of Cinnamon, of Cloves, of Nutmegs, of Rosemary, of
Sassafras, of Wormwood, of Limons, and of sweet Marjoram, of each half an
ounce: being all well mixed together, keep them so, till the fermentation is
completely absolved, which done, bring it into the just consistency for a mass
of Pills, by adding Bezoar oriental, Bezoar mineral, Camphir, Cochinele, of
each a like quantity in subtle powder, than keep it close in Wooden or Silver
Boxes with screws, for use.

11. This is a truly noble Medicament, the Opium being fermented and filled
with volatile Salts, and almost a thousand times transcends other Opiates,
whether made of crude Opium, or the Vulgar preparations thereof; yet this we
affirm of Opium, unprepared or Crude, that it consists chiefly of volatile
parts, and therefore can have no such operation of fixing a Disease, as some
Gentlemen have been pleased to affirm, against which assertion we thus Argue.

12. Opium, and so all Opiates, are either fixed or volatile, that is, they
consist either of fixed or of volatile parts: if of fixed parts, they can
perform nothing at all, much less fix any thing; for all fixed things are dead
things, they can neither act or move, nor can they penetrate or enter into
another property, for that they are fixed and as it were immovable: if they be
volatile, then they must do violence to their own nature and act against their
own property, which to affirm, is next akin to pure nonsense: so that we
conclude, that by reason of the volatile particles of which they consist, they
are so far from fixing any Disease, or making it immovable, that on the
contrary they became a means of moving such Diseases which are already fixed.

13. But to return to our sick Patient, by the continual taking of this Our
Laudanum, the Catarrh was at length perfectly removed, and his Paralytick
Distemper much abated: now that we might the more effectually go through with
the Cure, I caused the following Topics to be applied to him.

14. First, I ordered all the Paralytick parts as also the Spina dorsi from the
highest Vertebra down to the Os Coccygis, to be bathed well Morning and
Evening, with the following Compositum: Take powers of Rosemary, of Sage, of
Marjoram, of Lavender, of Savin, of Amber, of each a like quantity, mix them
together and keep the Tincture for use. And sometimes the said parts were bathed
only with Powers of Amber alone.

15. I also caused his Head to be shaved, and bathed it with this mixture: Take
Powers of Sassafras, of Savin, of Rhodium, of each one ounce: Powers of Musk,
two ounces: mix them for use. With this the whole Head was bathed, the
Forehead, Temples, Nostrills, and Pulses, as also the pit of the Stomach,
Morning and Night, for about ten days: this don, his Head was shaved again, and
bathed once more with the said mixture, after which I caused the Emplaster of
Franciscus Valesius to be applied over the whole Head, and to be renewed every
fifth day, the which was reiterated six times.

16. After these things had been don for about twenty days; I caused the parts
to be bathed twice a day with a strong Tincture of Myrrh, made with rectified
Spirit of Wine, for the space of twelve or fourteen days, and the parts to be
bound up with Leather: by this the Nerves were mightily strengthened, and the
Man seemed to be restored out of his languishing condition.

17. But that all things which were needful for him might be performed, I
caused him to drink constantly a Diet made of Guajacum, Sarsa, and Sassafras,
after this manner: Take Raspings of Guajacum, and Sassafras, of each twelve
ounces: Sarsaparilla, 24 ounces: Juniper Berries, Peony-seeds, Caraways,
Coriander-seeds, of each four ounces: all bruised: Raisons stoned, Figs slit,
of each two pounds: boil all in twenty four quarts of Water to twelve; strain,
cool, let it settle, and bottle it up with a little Sugar and a Clove slit in
halves, in each bottle; of this he drank a pint and h lf, and sometimes a quart
a day; and the Diet was six times repeated: he took about a pint in the Morning
fasting, and as much at Night going to Bed.

18. But for his ordinary drink; the same ingredients were boiled in twenty
quarts more of water to which was added fresh Raisons stoned, Figs sl^t, of
each a pound: Peony-seeds, Coriander-seeds, Caraways and Juniper Berries, of
each two ounces: this was boiled to twelve quarts as the former, and bottled up
in like manner, this he drank at meals, and as his ordinary drink, for ten or
twelve weeks together.

19. This kind of Diet I prescribed, for that Experience has confirmed it as a
most admirable thing to corroborate the Vital and Animal functions and
strengthen the Nerves; which it performs in part, by altering the Discrasie of
the Neurotick juice; and in part by drying up, and consuming the superfluous
humidities; which the Nerves and Nervous parts seem to be watered and weakened
with.

20. But whereas he was sometimes troubled with fainting and swooning fits, I
ordered him between whiles, but more especially at the time of the Paroxysm, or
rather upon the approach thereof to take this following mixture: Take choice
Cinnamon Water, Angelica-water, the greater composition, of each eight ounces:
juice of Alkermes, six ounces: Tinctura aurea, two ounces: mix them. Of this he
took now and then, as aforesaid, a large spoonful or better. And sometimes for
want thereof he took Our Tinctura Vitae, from a quarter of a spoonful to half a
spoonful: And sometimes he took the said Tincture mixed with a half part of
juice of Alkermes, by the use of which the fainting and swooning fits in a
little time, were perfectly removed. See the said Tincture in Our Doron, lib.
2. cap. 7. sect. 2.

II. A Paralytick Distemper in the lower parts of the right side, with the
Stone in the Reins.

1. A Man about 37. years of age, having for a long time been troubled with a
great Pain in the Reins, with difficulty of making water, and sometimes voiding
of red Sand or Gravel, (from which symptoms the Physicians conceived him to be
afflicted with the Stone) was at length in the extremity of one of his
Paroxysms taken with a Paralytick distemper on his right side, from his Loins
downwards to his Foot.

2. This continuing upon him, he sought out for help, and was for near two
years in several Physicians hands, but without any the least benefit: the
distemper of the Sone (as it was thought) also continued with him: These things
brought upon him many other weaknesses, so as that it seemed there was a
complication of Diseases, nor could those who were his constant Physicians tell
well what to make of it: but that they might say something; they pronounced it
to be a high Scorbute, and that for his absolute cure he must be bound to drink
the Waters for some considerable time.

3. Through the continuance of this Indispotion, he was taken with an extreme
vomiting, which was in part caused from the consent or compassion of parts,
arising from the Inferior and greater branches of the Internal stock of the
Nerves of the Par Vagum and the superior Branch of the same; for that the
Ramifications of the said Internal stock serve both the Stomach, Kidneys, and
Bladder; The Twig of the Dexter superior Branch of the internal stock goes to
the right side of the bottom of the Stomach, the upper membrane of the Omentum:
and the Tunicle of the Liver. The Inferior branch of the said Internal Stock
goes to the right Kidney (and hence is the cause of vomiting in the stone in
the Reins:) And the third and greatest branch of the said Internal stock send
twigs to the Mesentery, Guts, and right side of the Bladder; so that the
Anatomical reason is sufficiently evident.

4. But besides the compassion of Parts, there was an exceeding foulness of the
Stomach, which was contracted from his too liberal feeding, and over gorging of
his Stomach with Varieties and Delicacies, which was to such an excess, that he
seldom rose from table without being sick, and sometimes vomiting after his so
liberal eating: this course he took for some years, so that at length he could
scarcely eat at all, and at the time of this his illness he took his food, no
otherwise but as he forced himself, which for the most part he vomited up again.

5. For this indisposition of his Stomach and to take away the vomiting, his
Physicians gave him Mint-water, Spirit of Mint, and syrup of Mint, and
Mint-water mixed with syrup of Quinces; as also Conserve of Mint and
Wood Sorrel, sometimes alone, and sometimes made into a kind of Electuary with
conserves of Barberries; but alas! all these things were don in vain: Outwardly
too they applied to him greasy Oils and Ointments, and certain Emplastick
Bodies, to remove the Paralysis, but without the least success.

6. The Patient at length fell into my Hands, who gave me a full relation of
all things which had passed, from which I conjectured at the cause of his
Disease: I concluded him to be affected either with the Stone or Gravel in the
Reins, or some other obstructive matter, and so much the more because of a
Paralysis succeeding the same: which was caused partly from the compression of
the Muscle Psoa on which the Kidneys lie, and is appointed for the bending of
the Thigh, being inserted into the inner part thereof.

7. The Man being of a strong constitution of Body, I first began with
cleansing of his Stomach, which I performed by giving him my Pulvis
Admirabilis, which you may see in my Doron Medicum, lib. 2. cap. 21. sect. 14.
I gave it him to a scruple in Diodates syrup of sugar, and gave it him every
third day, till I had reiterated it five times: It wrought both upwards and
downwards, and during the time of the working he took Broth or Posset Drink, as
in other purges.

8. In the Intervalls of purging, that we might, in some measure comfort and
strengthen the body, a little weakened by the evacuation, I gave him of the
following mixture, which was taken an hour before eating, three times a day:
Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, two ounces: juice of Alkermes, one ounce: Oil of
Mint, thirty six drops: mix them: dose two drams at a time.

9. Having thus effectually cleansed his Stomach, and taken away in part the
morbifick matter, I conceived it necessary, to do something for the removing
that Distemper of his Reins: for which purpose I prescribed the following
Liquor to be taken in all the drink which he drank. It was thus made: Take
distilled Waters of Onions, and of Hydropiper, of each eight ounces: drop into
it so much of the best Spirit of Niter, as may give it a pleasing Acidity: This
he took several times a day; and sometimes he took it sweetened with Syrup of
Marshmallows. I also ordered him to take the Spirit of Niter in all his drink;
a few drops at a time; and sometimes the dulcified Spirit after this manner:
Take choice Metheglin, half a pint: dulcified Spirit of Niter, forty drops: mix
them for a draught. By the use of these things a large quantity of Gravel and
Sand came daily away.

10. But by some Symptoms which appeared, I feared there might be some Stone in
the Bladder, for which reason, I caused him to be searched, and a Stone was
found about the bigness of a large Wall-nut; but, for that it was of a gritty
and brittle substance, it broke into several pieces upon the search, which gave
me encouragement to proceed the more vigorously on the Cure; and therefore I
the more earnestly pressed the use and continuance of the former things, by
which we cleared all those Parts of the offending matter; for all the substance
of the Stone came away by degrees in Gravel, and sometimes in little bits.

11. And the more to promote this Cure, withal having respect to the Palsy of
the Part; I caused him to take every Morning fasting half a pint of the
following Liquor: Take Bark of Guajacum; Lignum Aloes, Galangal, Gentian,
Zedoary, of each two ounces: Raspings of Guajacum, of Sassafras, and of China,
of each si^ ounces: Sarsaparilla, roots of Angelica, and Peony, of each eight
ounces: Onions bruised, Hydropiper, Betony, Ivy-leaves, Lavender, Rosemary, of
each ten ounces: Venice-Treacle, half a pound: Cinnamon, Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs,
seeds of Peony and Pars^^, of each three ounces: all being well bruised, let
them be digested in eight Gallons of Rhenish-Wine, in a gentle heat, for the
space of two or three days, then put them into a Copper Vesica tin'd within,
adding thereto three Gallons of spring water: distill off eight Gallons of Water
according to Art (but beware of burning) which Water dulcifie, and aromatize,
with three pounds and a half or four pounds of tabulated Sugar prepared with
Oil of Cinnamon. This he took constantly according to my order, and it is
incredible what good he received from the use thereof.

12. But this is to be noted, that as sometimes he took it alone, so many times
he took it with drops of the Spirit of Niter, to a pleasing Acidity; and
sometimes with the vulnerary Spirits of Sulphur and Vitriol; by the use of which
things many great obstructions in his Body were removed and his Stomach, so
exceedingly debilitated, as aforesaid, comforted and restored.

13. However besides taking the Pulvis admirabilis, as abovesaid, I once a week
constantly purged him with the Tincture of my Family-Pills, by the use of which
Medicament it is almost incredible what a vast quantity of cold, slimy,
viscous, and sometimes purulent matter was brought away, by which the sick often
confessed himself to be much better, and that the hope of his cure was now
apparent.

14. For his constant drink, I prescribed a weak Decoction of Guajacum,
Sassafras, and Sarsaparilla to be made, which drink I caused him to take even
at meals: you have several Examples of such a Diet in some of the Chapters
aforegoing, so that in this place I need say no more thereof.

15. Now whereas he often complained (in the Intervals of purging) of his Body
being bound; I prescribed this following Clyster to move his Belly: Take
Mutton-broath, a pint: Oyl-olive, Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, of each three
ounce: Tincture of fine Aloes, one ounce: mix them, and let it be exhibited
warm: This cleansed the Bowels, and brought away with the hardened Excrements
much slimy matter, so that his Body would be open four or sive days after it,
even till the time of repeating the purge.

16. As for Topics I caused the Paralytick Members to be well rubbed with
cloths, then to be fomented with Wine wherein Cephalic and Antiparalytick
Herbs had been boiled: this done to be very well bathed with a strong
Aniseed-water, for the Aniseeds have a specific Virtue in comforting and
restoring the Nerves, especially if hurt by any cold and moist Distemper, or
frustration of animal Spirits.

17. This being done for some days, the said Parts were Morning and Night
bathed with this following Mixture: Take Powers of Aniseeds, Powers of
Caraways, of each two ounces: Powers of Rosemary, one ounce: mix them to bath
with as aforesaid. By the use of this alone Medicament externally the Palsy was
removed, and the sick came to the complete sense and use of his Limbs.

18. Yet was not the ancient strength restored, for which purpose I ordered him
(as for the most part in such like cases) to bath with the Tincture of Myrrh
made with rectified Spirit of Wine, which has a most excellent corroborating
Virtue; this was done Morning and Evening for a week together.

19. Lastly, I prescribed this following Cataplasm to be laid to the joints of
the weakened Parts, and to be renewed every two days: Take Mithridate, four
ounces: Myrrh, two ounces: dissolved or made soft in Spirit of Wine: Yolks of
Eggs, number three: Oil of Aniseeds, one dram: mix them well together; spread
it upon Leather, and apply it as aforesaid. By the use of these things, in
about twenty weeks time the sick was perfectly restored: But he continued the
use of the Spirit of Niter, for above three Months after.

III. A Palsy in a young Man accumulated through lying in the cold.

1. A young Soldier by lying abroad one Night in the Snow, was taken with a
Palsy of the whole Body, and that in so extreme a manner, that he seemed to be
helpless: he was before of a healthy constitution, strong Body, and fleshy
withal, but not very fat: In this condidition he applied himself to several
pretenders to Physic, but all in vain.

2. At length he fell into my hands, and I cured him by the following means.
First considering him to be strong and able to endure strong Physic, I
evacuated his Stomach with a Dose of Vinum Benedictum, and repeated the same
again the third day: on the fifth day I purged him with my Family Pills with
Aloes, and repeated the same again on the seventh and ninth day: afterward I
only purged him once a week with the Tinct. ex tribus.

3. After the ninth day I gave him a sweating dose: Take Venice Treacle, one
dram: Bezoar mineral, one scruple: Saffron in powder, six grains: mix, and give
it at Night going to bed: This sweat him well, and powerfully: In the time of
his sweating, least he should faint, I ordered him to take now and than a
spoonful or two of this following Cordial: Take strong Cinnamon Water, six
ounces: Aqua Caelestis, Poppy-water, Damask-rose-water, of each three ounces:
syrup of Citron peels, juice of Alkermes, of each two ounces and a half: mix
them, to be given as aforesaid.

4. This sudorifick dose was seven times repeated, at five and sometimes at six
days distance, by means of which, with what was outwardly applied, he quickly
found relief, and in short time after a perfect cure. But taking cold, after
one of his sweats, a Rheumetism fell upon him, which was much more tedious to
him than his Palsy, for he had running Pains which wandered up and down over his
whole body, sometimes in one side, anon in the other; sometimes in his Leg, then
in his Arm, then in his Shoulder, again in his Foot.

5. Moreover he was extremely afflicted with a Catarrh, which accosted him with
such a flux of Rheum, that he feared in the Night he should be choked, and in
the day he could do nothing but spit. To remedy these things, I thought it
necessary first to purge him again, which I did twice with my Family Pills, and
twice with the Tincture of the same. This purging gave him some relief, but did
not wholly take away either those running Pains or his Catarrh.

6. This don, I caused him to sweat well with a dose of my volatile Laudanum,
before described in the first Observation of this Chapter, by which he found an
incredible good: For this cause sake I repeated it four or five times more, at
what time his Pains wholly vanished, and his Catarrh was almost nothing at all:
yet least it should return again, I ordered him to continue the use of the said
Landanum for some time. He began with three grains, and increased the dose a
grain every seven days, till he took about twelve grains thereof at a time, and
then diminishing again, a grain at a time, by degrees left it off.

7. For his Diet I ordered him a mean decoction of Guajacum, Sassafras, and
Sarsaparilla, whose complement was Juniper Berries, and the Carminative-seeds
with Raisons and Figgs: into which was dropped constantly as he drank it some
drops of the Powers of Rosemary, Sage, and Lavender.

8. Likewise as an alterative to comfort and restore the Nervous system, he
took about the quantity of a Chestnut, Morning and Night, of this following
compositum: Take of Our Electuarium ad Tabidos, four ounces: Venice Treacle,
Castoreum, Extracts of Carduus Benedictus, of fine Aloes, of Gentian, and of
Virginian snake-root, of each one ounce: Oils of Rosemary, Sage, Lavender, and
sweet Marjoram, of each twelve drops: mix and make an Electuary, to be taken as
aforesaid, or when any sickness or illness afflicts the Stomach.

9. But while all these things were a doing, we neglected not Topical remedies.
First we caused his whole Body to be bathed twice a day, viz. Morning and
Night, with the Powers of Aniseeds, and of Amber, mix together in an equal
proportion. This was don for about five days.

10. After that he was well bathed twice a day with this mixture: Take Powers
of Aniseeds, Ox Galls, of each a pint: digest them in a gentle heat, then set
the Vessel in a Cellar, that the thick or grosser parts may settle: after a
weeks time decant, the more pure and clear part, which keep for use to bath the
Paralitick members with: by the constant use of these things, he was in about
thirteen or fourteen weeks time restored to his perfect health.

IV. A Palsy in a young Lady, accompanied with Convulsions of the Mesentery.

1. This Lady by reason of a fall from a Horse, was bruised on her Backbone
and very much hurt on her right side, so that she became lame, which lameness
proved to be an absolute resolution of the Nerves of the said right side,
wherein there was a numbness of the Part, trembl^ng and great impotency of
motion. To this there was added Fits occasioned through the Fright. These Fits
were altogether those called Hysterical, and so esteemed by the Physicians.

2. To perform the Cure, they purged her, bleed her, gave her Hysteric
Medicaments, and outwardly they used Frictions, Blisters, Oils, Ointments,
Emplasters, Baths, etc. so that little seemed to be left unattempted which they
had not done, yet all this was without the least advantage to the sick.

3. But as to the Hystetick Fits as they were accounted, I suppose there was a
mistake; for that Distemper which they thought to be from the Womb, was purely
a Convulsion of the Mesentery, wherein the nervous Parts were drawn (...)
together, and appeared outwardly nere the region of the Stomach like a great
Tumor, or something rising and swelling up the Part, which made her when in her
Fit beat and bruise herself, if not withheld by force, till such time as she
went quite away: when she came to herself again she would complain of a great
soreness and weakness in her Bowels, and withal a heaviness in her Loins, and
an indisposition to stir or move herself; and sometimes she would have such a
Distemper in her Stomach, as would make her sick at Heart, and vomit
exceedingly.

4. Hence it appears that her Disease was complicate, and proceeded from two
opposite causes, at least the Effects were opposite, for there was both a
Resolution of the Nerves and a Contraction also: which made the Disease so
contumacious, and difficult of Cure.

5. Such too was the vehemence of these Fits, that sometimes they would return
ten, or twelve times in the space of four and twenty hours, so that by reason
of the extremity thereof we were necessitated to use some speedy course to ease
and quiet the troubled and disturbed Archaeus: for we saw clearly that no
delays were to be permitted, and that if some speedy course was not taken, the
Patient must inevitably submit to her harder Fate: And therefore I first gave
her our volatile Laudanum, whose preparation we have taught in the first
Observation of this Chapter.

6. This Laudanum was at first exhibited in a Dose of two grains, which was
continued five days, and increased then a grain, and so augmented a grain every
fifth day, till such time as she took about twelve grains for a Dose: moreover
the next Morning she took from fifteen to thirty drops of our Guttae Vitae, in
a little glass of Cinnamon Water, and so reposed herself in bed till Noon, or
later.

7. Outwardly all the Regions of the Abdomen, Stomach, Liver, Spleen, and
Hypochonders were very well bathed with this Mixture: Take Powers of Amber, and
of Aniseeds, of each two ounces: Powers of Pepper, half an ounce: mix and bath
the Parts afflicted therewith; this was done Morning and Evening for five or
six days: by the use of these things, the Fits were repressed much, and whereas
they used to return sometimes eight, ten, or twelve times a day, they came now
sometimes but once a day, sometimes but once in two or three days, and sometimes
but once in a week.

8. But that we might wholly suppress and co^quer them, I praescribed this
following Bolus; to be given once a day, viz. at Night going to bed, for two or
three weeks, or a Month, or as long as we should see occasion: Take of our
Electuarium ad Tabidos, a dram: choice Musk in fine Powder, fourteen grains:
Ambergrise, Laudanum volatile nostrum, of each six grains: mix and make a
Bolus. This was taken constantly at time of going to bed, immediately after the
reception of which, I ordered her to take this following Julep: Take
Orange-Flower Water, six ounces: Aqua Vitae Matthioli, Syrup of Citron-Peels,
of each an ounce and a half: mix them for one Dose.

9. These Rules thus followed, did in about a Months or five weeks time
absolutely and perfectly free her from her supposed Hysteric Fits, which as we
said before were only, and purely Convulsions of the Mesentery: However, we did
not only give her Alteratives, but always in about eight or ten days time I
gently purged her, (that the morbifick matter might also be evacuated) which
was done with the Tincture of my Family-Pills: It wrought very well upon her,
and gave her commonly seven or eight stools that day.

10. Having thus overcome one branch of the complication, it was necessary to
have respect to the other, viz. the Palsy, although during all this time, we
were not unmindful of applying proper Topics for this occasion, as hereafter
in this Observation you will find.

11. In the first place I instituted a Diet made of Guajacum, Sarsaparilla, and
Sassafras which was boiled in Water (after an infusion of eight and forty
hours) till nerely half the Water was consumed, and at the end of the boiling
there was added to every quart of the Diet half a pint of Hippocras; which
being bottled up as we have formerly taught, I ordered to be taken as her
ordinary drink, but more especially in the Morning fasting, and last at Night
going to bed.

12. Now because the Paralytick Distemper yet continued, (although there was
indeed some Symptoms of Amendment) I prescribed this Purge, Take White Wine,
eight ounces: choice Sena, half an ounce: Rhubarb, two drams: infuse all twelve
hours in a gentle sand-heat, then strain out and add thereto Powers of
Caraways, two drams: Powers of Aniseeds, one dram: dulcify it with Syrup of
Clove-gilly-Flowers, and give it in the Morning fasting. This wrought very
well, without the least griping or making sick, and gave the sick about ten or
twelve stools, of cold, watery, and slimy matter.

13. This purging I continued from this time once a week, till the Cure was
accomplished: but sometimes a Tincture was drawn from the Ingredients with
Cardamom-Water, which the Patient liked much better: and although the Patient
took at least twenty Doses of this purgng Liquo^, yet was she not in the least
weaked by it, but made much the stronger, so that by degrees she eat her Food
heartily, and after an insensible manner came to the use of her Limbs, the
Disease every day vanishing

14. From this Observation, and some others of like kind, it is manifest how
great things are wrought by purgative Medicaments which are given in spirituous
Vehicles; for that the Virtue of the Medicament is made by their means to enter
the more easily into the Veins, and thereby to mix it self intimately with the
Mass of Blood, whereby such a fermentation or struggling and separation in the
Blood is made as causes a praecipitation and excretion of the morbifick matter,
even beyond expectation.

15. And in all sorts of Paralytick Distempers this kind of purging has greater
effect, because thereby not only the humid and diseasy matter is drawn away;
but the Neurotick juice, too much cooled and weakened, is restored and
confirmed, whereby a restitution of the pristin health succeeds.

16. In her Diet before mentioned she constantly took of this following
mixture, forty, sixty or more drops at a time: Take Powers of Rosemary, Powers
of Lavender, Powers of sweet Marjoram, of each a like quantity: mix them
together to be used as aforesaid. But at Morning and Night she took about half
a spoonful of the same in the Diet aforementioned.

17. Twice a day, viz. an hour before Dinner, and an hour before Supper, she
took the quantity of a large Nutmeg of this Electuary: Take Electuarium ad
Tabidos, one ounce: Powers of Vipers, three drams: mix them well together.
After the taking of it, she washed it down with a little glass of Hippocras.
This Medicament immediately after it was taken warmed the whole humane frame,
to a very high degree, yet not so as to inflame it, or cause a Fever; yet her
whole Body would presently grow as warm as if she had been heat by a very great
fire.

18. The use of this Medicament was continued during the whole time of the
Cure; yet sometimes for change sake, she took the said Powers of Vipers in a
glass of Sack, or Hippocras, which notwithstanding had the same virtue and
effects, in warming or heating the ^niversal frame as before.

19. But whereas she sometimes complained of an illness and weakness of Stomach,
as also of want of Appetite and Loathing, I caused her oftentimes, both between
meals and at meals also, to take of the volatile Spirit of Vitriol or Sulphur,
made so by mixing, digesting, and being distilled off with rectified spirit of
Wine; after this manner: Take rectified spirit of Wine; two quarts: drop there
into, by degrees, two pounds of the best Oils of Vitriol or Sulphur: shake them
well together: digest in a gentle sand-heat sixteen weeks at least, shaking the
Vessel once a day: then put it into a glass Cucurbit (or a Retort if you so
please) and leisurely draw off the Spirit with a very slow and gradual Fire, so
that the pure, thin, and volatile Spirit may only ascend, and the thick Magma
remain alone at Bottom. And for this cause you must be very cautious that the
Fire does not exceed its just Limits, for that if it be too great, the Magma
will ascend with the Spirit, and then all your Labor will be lost, and you
will be forced to repeat the Distillation again.

20. The use of this Spirit restored the Tone of the Stomach, and made her
digest her Food very well, besides it has a great Power to restore the motive
Faculty in all Paralytick Distempers, for that it has a specific Virtue to
open all Obstructions of the Nerves in what Part of the Body so ever.

21. And now and then for the Stomach sake also, I permitted her to eat
preserved Nutmegs, candied Orange, Limon, and Citron-Peels; and sometimes
preserved green Ginger: and sometimes she took this Electuary: Take Conserves of
Betony, Sage, Cowslips, and Rosemary-Flowers, of each two ounces: preserved
Nutmegs extremely well beaten, number four: Indian preserved green Ginger, four
ounces: candied Orange, Limon, and Citron Peels, of each two ounces and half:
beat all very well together; and with Juice of Alkermes a sufficient quantity
make an Electuary, with which mix well Oil of Cinnamon, half an ounce: Of this
she took as her Stomach required it, the quantity of a Chest-nut at a time. By
the use of these things the Cure apparently drew on.

22. Whilst all these things were doing we were not unmindful (as we before
declared) of using fit Topics to the distemper: and therefore in the first
place we caused the Nucha and Vertebrae of the Spina dorsi from the Original
thereof down to the Os Coccygis to be well bathed with this mixture: Take
anisated Balsam of Sulphur, two ounces: Chemical oil of Lavender, one ounce:
mix them well together. This was anointed upon the places aforenamed Morning
and Night, for nere a month together; it had not been used twelve or fourteen
days before the sick found great benefit therefrom.

23. All the extreme parts also of the Body which the Palsy had seized were
bathed with this following: Take Powers of Rosemary, of Lavender, of Savin, of
Sassafras, and of Limons, of each three ounces: Powers of sweet Marjoram, of
Sage, and of Amber, of each an ounce and half: mix them together: with this the
Paralytick parts were bathed Morning and Night, during almost the whole time of
the Cure.

24. Lastly, to strengthen and coroborate the Nerves, this following Emplaster
or Cataplasm was applied over all the Paralytick members (after the aforesaid
bathing was over) Take Venice Treacle, twelve ounces: yolks of Eggs, number
six: Balsam of Peru, fat Myrrh made soft with rectified spirit of Wine, of each
four ounces: Balsamum Capivie, two ounces: powder of Cubebs, or of Zedoary,
enough to make it of a fit consistency, not too hard, mix them well together:
and let them be spread upon Leather, and apply to the Diseased parts.

25. This disaffection at first was great, and the poor Patient truly
deplorable, for that in the Eye of humane reason she seemed to be absolutely
incurable: but by the assiduous use and application of the aforegoing remedies,
according to our directions, the Cure was completely accomplished in a little
more than half a years time, to the great satisfaction of all the persons
concerned.

V. A Palsy in a young Woman occasioned by taking a great cold after violent
Sweating.

1. This young Woman being in a vehement Sweat through long and much Exercise,
and being impatient, cooled her-self with cold Water, and withal exposed
her-self to the Wind and cold Air, so that cooling her-self too hastily she
contracted such a Cold, as brought upon her immediately a complication of many
Evils: For she contracted a vehement Cough, and so great a Hoarsness, as that
she could scarcely speak so as to be understood: Moreover she had a
straightness of Breath, an obstruction of the Lungs and difficulty of
breathing, together with many and great Pains, which seized her in all her
extreme Parts, that she became lame, and the use of all her Limbs was taken
from her: after, about ten days, her Pains vanished, and she became absolutely
Paralytick.

2. Being in this Condition, I thought fit to provoke sweating by this
following: Take mineral Bezoar, one scruple: of our new London-Treacle, half a
scruple: Venice-Treacle, half a dram: mix them for a Dose. It was given at
Night going to bed, and the sick sweat well: during the time of her sweating
this cordial Julep was given her to keep up her Spirits, and preserve her from
fainting: Take Spirit of Saffron, of the best Cinnamon Water, of each four
ounces: Angelica-Water, Bawm-Water, of each three ounces: Juice of Alkermes,
Syrup of Citron-Peels, of each two ounces: mix them. Dose a spoonful or two now
and then, to prevent fainting. This sweating was repeated four times, at four
days distance.

3. In the Intervals of the sweating, I prescribed these things: Take
Venice-Treacle, a dram: anisated Balsam of Sulphur, twenty drops: volatile Salt
of Man's skull, eight grains: mix them for a Dose to be taken every Morning,
after which she drank a little glass of the Queen of Hungarias Water well
dulcisied: at Night going to bed she took this: Take Oil of sweet Almonds new
drawn, two ounces: Syrup of Citron-Peels, Syrup of Jujubes, of each an ounce
and half: white Sugar Candy in subtle Powder, six drams: mix them for a Dose
to be given at Night going to bed. By the use of these things her Cold and
Hoarsness were wholly taken off, and she was somewhat amended as to her
Paralytick Disaffection, but yet far from a Cure, so that I was forced wholly
to apply my Mind to that.

4. After therefore that her sweating was over, I ordered her to take the
volatile Spirit of Sulphur or Vitriol (mentioned in the last Observation) every
day, at least four, five, or six times a day in a glass of choice Hippocras,
sometimes also in Mead or Wine, and sometimes in a glass of Ale, as she liked
best: this she took from forty to sixty or eighty drops at a time, as she liked
best herself.

5. And sometimes she took the said volatile Spirit of Vitriol in a glass of
this following Docoction: Take Guajacum rasped, Acorus-roots, of each six
ounces: roots of Angelica, and of Peony, of each nine ounces: choice
Sarsaparilla, China, of each eighteen ounces: Coriander and Caraway-seeds, of
each four ounces: Spanish Juice of Liquorice, three ounces: Figs slit, three
pounds: Spring Water, four and twenty quarts: boil all till the Water is half
consumed, then strain, let it settle, and bottle it up with a Clove slit, and
an ounce of white Sugar in each Bottle: this she took as her ordinary drink,
during the time of her Cure.

6. Lastly, having very well bathed all the Backbone and the Paralytick
Members with the Powers of Amber and of Aniseeds mixed in equal proportion for
about ten days Morning and Night: and afterward with Ox-Gall mixed with an
equal quantity of the Powers of Rosemary, this miserable Creature was in about
twelve weeks time restored to her perfect health and strength, to the
admiration of all that saw her in that her languishing Condition.

VI. A Palsy in a middle-aged Man arising from drinking cold Water too
plentifully, etc.

1. A Man nere forty years of age, by being exposed to extreme cold in the
middle of Winter, and being forced also to drink too plentifully cold Water,
was taken with a Paralytick Distemper almost of the whole Body, so that what
with the loss of his Sense of Feeling, and impotency of motion, he became
helpless to himself.

2 It would be worth the while to e^quire somewhat strictly into the cause of
his Dis^ase, he being of a gross and fat Body, and at the first seizure thereof
afflicted with a most vehement Catarrh, which being imprudently stopped, before
the morbifick matter was carried off or evacuated, presently retreated, and
fell upon the Muscles and Nerves: and this we should now do, but that we have
determined to treat thereof more amply in another place.

3. However we shall not be wanting to the young Artist, but will deliver in
this place the sense of several learned Authors, from the disquisitions of whom
it is hoped the ingenious Favorers of Truth may possible investigate her
Footsteps. Thus from a cold Distemper, or too much cooling of the Muscles and
Nerves, but chiefly those Muscles into which the affected Nerves are inserted,
a Palsy of those Parts whose Nerves are affected, is said to succceed: for that
Cold being a very great Enemy to them, either binds them up, or condenses them,
so that the animal Spirit can no longer have a passage, whereby their Function
cease.

4. Now the Disaffection of the spinal Marrow or Nerve is that which deprives
it of the animal Spirit the essential Agent of all natural Motions; for being
so affected, it can neither any more communicate to the Muscles the Faculty or
Power of moving, nor to the sensible Parts the Power of Feeling; and the
remaining part of it from the place affected, even to the part into which it is
inserted becomes unprofitable.

5. This is true also, if the continuity with the part be dissolved, for then
the passage is interrupted; or if the Nerves be so constringed, that the animal
Spirit, which exacts a free passage through the nervous System, can no longer
flow through, or fill it up, or not so amply as it ought to do; which sometimes
happens if the Nerve be pressed upon in any part, whereby its substance is so
condensed that the animal Spirit thereupon becomes interrupted: and this is
often caused from an afflux of humors, chiefly such as are cold and pituitous:
and s^mtimes by a Blow, Compression, Ligatures, etc.

6. And as an Apoplexy, which is a Palsy of the whole Body, (as we shall
hereafter explicate) is generated from a pituitous, or a watery, serous, cold,
and moist Excrement of the Brain, watering of it, or pressing upon the original
of the Nerves; so this bedewing, or otherwise afflicting the Nerves themselves
causes a Palsy: for falling from the Head, not through the substance of the
spinal Marrow, but either descending through the Cavity of the Vertebrae of the
Spina Dorsi, which does contain the spinal Marrow, and there stopping about the
beginning or passage of it, or falling down farther through the progress, which
the conjugations of Nerves pass in their entrance into the Body, following the
said conjugations, and sticking here and there about the Nerves; in what place
soever this happens, whether about the spinal Marrow, or about the
conjugations, or branches of Nerves proceeding therefrom, by bedewing or
compressing them, it produces a Palsy, either of more or fewer Parts,
according as a more general or particular Nerve is affected.

7. For if plenty of humors flow theither, in those narrow places, and by their
weight, or taking up of place do compress the Nerves, the animal Spirit must
necessarily be intercepted in its passages: and if this matter be long detained
there, it becomes thicker and mucous: and also by humecting, filling, and
cooling the substance of the Nerves, it destroys their proper Temper in that
place, and so hinder the free occourse of the animal Spirit, so that the said
Nerves cannot be filled therewith nor enjoy it: whence also by the
interposition of this morbifick matter, in the place of the first disaffection,
the other branches of the said Nerve, which are carried to and supply other
Parts, are also frustrated as to the exercise of their Functions; so that if
the hurt be great, there must needs follow a perfect resolution of the Parts
unto which those Nerves are communicated, and that by so much the more lasting
and pertinacious, by so much as the hurt of the Nerve is greater; and which
Authors affirm they have found by dissection, to be the true cause of a Palsy
proceeding from cold, moist, and pituitous humors; wherein the spinal Marrow
has been swelled up with a watery humor: so that in this case there is no need
to conceit any obstruction in the Nerves, which are made up of filaments, nor
any cavity which may admit that thick humor, as some have foolishly thought.

8. Also such a superfluous or excrementitious humor arising elsewhere than
from the Brain, being carried to the Nerves of certain parts, or heaped up
there, does induce a Palsy proper to certain parts, which sometimes also mixed
with other acid and colerick humors, or otherwise putrefying, not only by
humecting but also by iritating the Nerves, does cause Pains, and together with
them a resolution of the part, and sometimes withal ending in Convulsions: and
this sometimes happens in colic Pains, Pains of the Mesentery, Torments of the
Limbs, and other disaffections.

9. The same also is thought to come to pass from extravasated Blood, falling
into these cavities of the Nerves, and a long time retained there, but this is
very rare or seldom seen: but a great and lasting pressure of a part, caused by
a heavy burden, or some other force, especially in that place where the Nerves
are great, or lie bare under the skin, may cause a repulsion of the Animal
Spirits, and hinder its afflux whereby a tingling and stupidity will be
induced, after a little while an abolition of motion, and at length a perfect
stupidity of the part, into which the compressed Nerve is inserted.

10. And this often falls out in lying, especially in the time of sleep, one
part lying long upon another, as the Body on the Arm, one Foot on the other, or
sitting long upon the Buttocks in Bed, without stirring, by which such a
pressure is made, as oftentimes renders the part immovable, and insensible,
which the common people call a sleep; this if the pressure be very long, and
the sense return not in some reasonable time, causes at length a certain
resolution of the part: but this compression being sudden and caused with a
strong blow upon the Nerve, it only causes a stupidity mix with Pain, and a
sense of Tingling, but not a Resolution or Palsy; as it is often wont to fall
out in the accidental striking of the E^bow, there where the Nerve lies almost
bare.

11. Sometimes also a Palsy is caused from too hard Ligatures of the Members,
chiefly where a Nerve is contained under the bandage; for that the sense of
feeling and motion of the part do cease: and if the recurrent Nerves be too
hard bound, there is immediately a defect of speech, and at length the voice is
totally lost.

12. Upon a luxation of the Vertebrae, and the bones of other joints, if there
be a vehement pressure of the adjacent Nerves, a Palsy certainly follows: but
this seldom comes to pass, because the Nerves in those parts, for the most part
gives way, so that other disaffections commonly follow upon such like accidents.

13. Sometimes also it comes to pass that a pituitous or serous humor a long
time wasting and humecting the Tendons of the Muscles, does make them to be too
much relaxed, whence follows a Palsy of that part: but this chiefly happens in
those places where many Tendons are carried in a straight or narrow place and
void of much flesh; as about the bending of the Joints, which are bound and
joined together with Ligaments, as it were with Rings, as in the regions of the
Wrist and Instep, where sometimes a humor retained, by reason of the
straightness of the place, (many small bones being also tied together in the
Carpus and Metacarpium, as also in the Ankle and Instep,) humecting and
relaxing the Tendons, causes that the Hands and Feet do continue Paralytick
all their life time after.

14. And although the Palsy may be overcome and cease in other parts of the
Body, yet it remains in those, yea when the humor is wasted, the Tendons
remaining longer than is fit, whence for ever after, they carry their Hands and
Feet hanging: and when they strive to lift them up, or to lay hold on any thing
(because nevertheless they can m^ve their Fingers or go) yet because they
cannot do that by the benefit of the Musches, they are wont to cast them up on
high by the force or strength of the Arm or Thigh, in which also many times
appears an eminency, like as it were a certain Tumor in the superficies of the
Wrist or Ankle arising by reason of Extenuation; which is wont to accompany the
same, the Bones bunching forth there: but oftentimes this resolution of the
Wrist, is accompanied with a Contraction of the Fingers, for that for want of
nutriment, the Ligaments and Tendons labor under an Atrophy whereby being
wasted and dried, they become contracted or shortened.

15. Hence it appears that all the Causes of any kind of voluntary motion
hurt, is either in the organ sending, or communicating the power of moving; not
in the principal part the Brain; for men also the Internal Senses would cease
together with the motion, which comes not here to pass: Therefore the cause is
in the Nerve, or in the Instrument which moves, a Muscle; Or in the part which
is moved, as is already in part explained and shall be more fully in what
follows.

16. Seeing the Nerves (under which name we comprehend both the Spinal marrow,
and Genus Nervosum) which are part of the Brain, every where repleat with the
Animal Spirit, do communicate the faculty of moving and feeling; if they be so
hurt that they can no more do that, then one or more Muscles into which they
are inserted, looses also their power of moving, not being any more able to
attract or draw up the Members which they ought to move, there presently
follows a resolution of the same, to wit, they becomes feeble and unfit for
motion.

17. And if the hurt be vehement, the sense of feeling is also taken away, not
only in the Muscle, but in the skin drawn over it, which receives sensory
Nerves from the same Nerve which is hurt. But if the hurt be not so great,
because greater force is required to exercise motion, than to confer the sense
of feeling, then this sense may be either perfect, or hurt in part, though the
motive faculty be totally abolisht: these things being thus premised and
considred, we shall now declare what Nerve affected does produce a Palsy in
eack respective part.

18 The spinal marrow lying under the Brain and being ready to receive its
excrements, is often hurt, and very much exposed to manifold Injuries; which if
it be affected in the beginning of its passage from the Brain through the
Backbone; by depriving all the Nerves which spring from it of the Animal
Spirit, it creates a general Palsy, in which all voluntary motions cease, as
well the stronger of the Body, as the weaker of the Face.

19. Besides the former, breathing also, the Voice, Speech, and Swallowing,
with some excretive motions, do suffer some hurt, more especially if the
prejudice be nere to the Brain, and great: because the conjugations of the
Nerves do issue forth there, from the beginning of the spinal Marrow, and they
also are hurt, as we shall show hereafter. But if in the rest of the production
of this Marrow, there happens any such detriment to the Back, then by taking
away the motive Faculty from those Nerves only, which are under it, it makes
those Members only Paralytick, into which they and their branches are inserted.

20. Therefore from the hurt or defect of the Members, it is manifest what Part
of the spinal Marrow is first in the prejudice; which in what place so ever it
is, if the prejudice be on both sides, the cause is in both; but if only in one
side, (as the said Spinae Medulla is perceived to be truly distinguished) that
only side becomes Paralytick: now the Palsy is so much the more general, by how
much the said spinal Marrow is more or nearer affected toward the Brain, or
original of the said Marrow.

21. If Pairs of Nerves, proceeding from the spinal Marrow be disaffected, then
according as a general Nerve, communicating Nerves to many Parts; or a special
one, communicating to some only, is seized with the Disease, so more or one
part suffers a resolution; by which also we may easily find out what Nerves are
affected, knowing beforehand, which are communicated to each part of the Body.

22. And hence many particular resolutions may be made in the Members, which
have received Nerves from the Pairs of the Spinal marrow, yet not in all;
because the Muscles moving the Breast (chiefly the Midriff, and those of the
Belly, being also compelled by a necessity of breathing, especially seeing
breathing is caused also from the help of natural motion) do nevertheless
perform their office in Paralytick parts, both in respiration, and excretion of
Excrements.

23. And therefore Authors affirm, That the Midriff does receive Nerves, not
only from the spinal Marrow, but also from some particular conjugations of
Nerves; now besides those Parts, the rest which are moved by the Muscles may
suffer a resolution withal.

24. The disaffection of the Nerves which are derived from the Brain, and do
communicate motion, show a Paralysis in those Parts to which those Nerves are
peculiar; and by a Palsy of the Part the Nerve affected is known: If the Nerves
of that conjugation derived to the Muscles of the Eye be affected, there is a
Palsy of the Eye; the which nevertheless cannot easily be done in this Nerve,
unless the Cerebrum adjacent be hurt, as it comes to pass in an Apoplexy.

25. But more commonly, the conjugations of Nerves, replenishing the Face,
Ey-lids, temporal Muscles, and Lips, are affected; whence there is oftener a
resolution of the Lips and Ey-lids, but seldom of the lower Jaw; for that the
temporal Muscle does receive more Nerves. If the Nerves of that conjugation
serving the Tongue, be hurt, the Tongue then suffers a Palsy, and the Speech
becomes defective: and then, by reason of its communication with the auditory
Nerve; if the defect or hurt be so great, that the sick becomes wholly Dumb,
they then are for the most part deaf also.

26. The same may happen in those Nerves (by some Authors) called the sixth and
seventh conjugations, which coming from the Brain, and being joined into one
descending Nerve, and communicating the sense of Feeling to many inferior
parts, and giving also motion to the Muscles of the Larynx, Tongue, Jaws,
Midriff, as also to the Muscles of the Bladder and Fundament: if, I say, it be
hurt about the Original, or somewhere in its Progress, it produces a Palsy of
the parts into which it is inserted, if they be moveable, but in other parts, a
certain kind of stupidity.

27. Hence if the recurrent Nerve be hurt, there is a defect of the Voice: if
the Nerves which go to the Muscles of the Jaws be hurt (seeing Swallowing is
caused by them, and not by the Fibers of the Oesophagus as some Authors have
thought) there is presently a difficulty of swallowing, with some difficulty of
breathing: If the Nerves which go to the Midriff be hurt, there is much danger
of suffocation, especially in a violent sending forth the Breath, as in calling
aloud, or in a vehement Cough, being then unable to express it; though
otherwise the Midriff (the Instrument of breathing, which receives also Nerves
from the Spinal marrow) can in some sort perform its office, those Nerves being
hurt: in which case if the sense of Feeling be hurt, the sick feels a heat and
tingling about the Stomach and other internal parts, chiefly among the greater
Nerves.

28. But if there be a certain general disaffection of the same conjugation,
then both the Sphincters of the Bladder and Anus, with the rest of their
Muscles will be Paralytick, from whence will follow in the one an involuntary
pissing; in the other, a relaxation of the Fundament, conjoined with the said
Paralytick Distemper, as hereafter in some other places we shall explicate more
at large.

29. From what has been said, it may be easy to determine, not only in this but
in any other Paralytick Patient, what conjugations of Nerves are most
afflicted; and that in universal Palsies, there is for the most part an
affliction of the whole Genus Nervosum, or nervous System, which oftentimes
happens from the contamination of the nervous Juice by the Poison of Mercury or
Quicksilver.

30. It remains now that we give you the History of this cure, which truly was
great, but performed by ordinary means. First I instituted a Diet of Guajacum,
Sassafras, and Sarsaparilla, such as that in sect. 1.. 17. and 18. aforegoing,
of which the Patient drank nerely a pint every Morning and Night: and then a
meaner or weaker decoction of the same ingredients in new water for ordinary
drink, to be taken at meals, unless now and than a glass of Hippocrass.

31. Next, I caused the sick to be purged once every fifth sixth or seventh
day, as I saw occasion, sometimes with the tincture of my Family Pills; and
sometimes with a Tincture of Sena and Rhubarb, made in small Cinnamon water,
after this manner: Take small Cinnamon Water, a quart: choice Sena, chosen
Rhubarb, very thin sliced, of each three ounces: make a gentle infusi^n in a
sand heat for twenty four hours: then strain out by gently pressing, and keep
the liquor in a glass close stopped for use: This quantity will serve for six
Doses, which are to be given early in the Morning fasting, with observation as
in other purges.

32. In the intervalls of purging, I caused the sick constantly to take these
following things: Take the Powers of Rosemary, and Lavender, of each two
ounces: Spirit of Angelica the greater composition, six ounces: mix them. Of
this mixture there was taken every Morning from half a spoonful to a spoonful
in a glass of Hippocras, and sometimes in a glass of Cinnamon Water.

33. An hour before Dinner, I prescribed this: Take Salt of Man's skull, sixteen
grains: salt of Hartshorn, salt of Vipers, of each eight grains: mix them, to
be given in a glass of Hippocras. It is mavelous to think what a great
alteration the exhibition of these things made in a very few weeks in this
Paralytick Patient: but whereas before I permitted, if required, a glass or two
of Hippocras at Dinner, so also I ordered as the sick liked it to take after
Dinner a glass of Wormwood-wine.

34. At night going to Bed, I ordered this: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, green
Ginger preserved, candied Orange-peels, Conserve of Rosemary, and
Lavender-flowers, of each three ounces: Custoreum in fine powder, Man's skull,
Anacardiums, of each two ounces: preserved Nutmegs, number six: Oils of
Rosemary, of Rue, of sweet Marjoram, of Lavender, of Limons, of Sage, and of
Sassafras, of each ten drops: juice of Alkermes, four ounces: or so much as may
make it of a just consistence: mix all very well together by beating in a
Mortar. Dose from six drams to an ounce at a time.

35. After five times purging, I sweat the Patient very well five times with
this following composition: Take Bezoar mineral, a scruple: Salt of Wormwood,
ten grains: Electuarium ad Tabidos, a dram: mix them together for a dose: This
was given about half an hour before going into the sweat; which was then
performed in Hartman s Chair, with rectified spirit of Wine set on fire: It was
supposed that every time more than a quart of sweat came from the sick: during
the time of Sweating, the spirits were supported and sustained with this
cordial Julep: Take spirit of Angelica the greater composition, or in place
thereof Aqua Vitae Matthioli, three ounces: small Cinnamon Water, four ounces:
Damask Rose Water, syrup of Citron peels, of each two ounces and half: mix them
together by shaking. This sweating was repeated commonly at five or six days
distance.

36. But whereas the sick was troubled with a vehement Catarrh, which by all
that we had yet done could not be taken away, I was forced at length to have
recourse to Opiates: and therefore after eleven weeks using all the former
things, without much success against the said Catarrh, I ordered the sick to
take every Night going to bed a dose of Our volatile Laudanum, the description
of which you may see in sect. 1.. 10. of this chapter. My Patient begun with
two grains, and increased a grain every fifth day, till the dose came to be
fifteen grains, at which time the Catarrh seemed to be wholly taken off: from
thence the dose was diminished a grain every third day, till it came to two
grains again, and then it was wholly given over, having accomplished what it
was designed for.

37. Yet constantly all the while this was doing, the prescript, at 32. and 33
aforegoing were not neglected, but assiduously followed with all the care
imaginable: and the Diet of Guajacum was also continued to the complete end of
the Cure.

38. While all these things were doing we applied to the grieved parts proper
Topics; first Frictions were used with course cloths all over the Paralitick
parts, then immediately after they were very well bathed and fomented with pure
spirit of Wine, by which the Pores were well opened, and made fit to receive
the impression of some more powerful remedy.

39. After the fomentation, all the Paralitick parts were anointed with this
following Oil: Take Oil of Ben, a pound and half: Chemical Oils of Rosemary, of
Lavender, of Savin, of Sassafras, of each an ounce and half: Oil of Aniseeds,
three ounces: mix them together to anoint with. This was anointed all over the
Backbone, as also upon all the Paralytick members Morning and Night (after
friction and fomentation, as aforesaid) and it was well rubbed in with the Hand
(by a comfortable fire) for half an hour together or more at a time.

40. Moreover I caused solid Errhines to be put up the Nostrills, they were
thus made: Take Confection Hamech, half an ounce: salt of Hartshorn, half a
dram: salt of Mans-skull, a scruple: Scammony, and Gambogia, of each a like
quantity in fine powder, enough to make the Electuary into a consistency for
Pills. Of this long slender rouls were made and put up into the Nostrills, and
kept there nere an hour and half, with a Muffler pined up before the Nose from
Ear to Ear: this was don four several times, but always about two hours or
something more before going to Bed (to prevent taking cold, which if it be don
in the Morning the Patient is very apt to do:) They operated admirable well,
and brought away a vast quantity of cold, pituitous and slimy Excrements out of
the Head, which very much facilated the Cure.

41. Lastly, I caused the Head to be shaved, and rubbed well; then to be bathed
with the Queen of Hungaries water, for about half a quarter of an hour: and
after that to be anointed well with this Oil: Take Oil of Ben, three ounces:
Musk in fine powder, Chemical Oils of Nutmegs, of sweet Marjoram, and of Savin,
of each three drams: mix them well together. With this the Head was constantly
anointed Morning and Night, and then bound up very warm: By the diligent use of
these things and careful following of these our directions, was this miserable
Patient perfectly restored to health in the space of twenty weeks time.

42. A young Man eighteen years of age, being taken with a general Palsy from
cold, was cured in three weeks time, only by anointing with the Oil at 39.
aforegoing; and taking as a Diet, a strong decoction of Juniper Berries, and
Calamus Aromaticus made in Wine, mixing therewith at time of taking about sixty
drops of the Powers of Rosemary.

43. A Woman also of about thirty years of age, going to Bed well, and rising
the next Morning Paralytick, was cured by anointing the palsied parts with the
aforesaid Oil at 39. for about ten days; and then afterward bathing the parts
affected Morning and Night with the Powers of Amber; being also three times
purged with the Tincture of Our Family Pills: and withal taking in all her
Drink some drops of spirit of Sal Armoniack.

44. Another young Man by lying one Night too long upon his Arm, became Palsied
in that part, so that he wholly lost the use of it: many things merely
Galenical were tried, upon him for about eight weeks together, but without the
least success: at length he was cured by taking inwardly only Powers of
Carawaies, Morning Noon and Night, chiefly in a glass of choice Canary; and
bathing the Paralytick members first with Powers of Aniseeds; then anointing
with the Oil mentioned at 39. aforegoing: by the use of these things he was
perfectly restored in about fourteen or sixteen days time.

VII. A Palsy in one part with a Contraction in another.

1. A Man about twenty four years of age had a Palsy on his right side,
occasioned as was thought by too long lying upon it: but in his left Hand a
Contraction, for all his Fingers were so contracted or drawn up, that they
could not by force be stretched out; but continually stood bent.

2. In regard he was of a pretty fat and corpulent Body, I prescribed him to
Drink this following Diet: Take Guajacum finely rasped, half a pound:
Sarsaparilla, Sarsafras, China, of each seven ounces: Rosemary, Lavender, sweet
Marjoram, Time, Hyssop, Savory, Savin, Peneroyal, Fetherfew, Tansie, Mint,
Angelica, of eight ounces: boil all in eighteen quarts of water (after an
infusion of twenty four hours in a sand or other gentle heat) to the
consumption of eight quarts: then strain out by pressing: let it settle, and
decant of the clear liquor, which bottle up, (being first well sweetened with
white Sugar, and a little Tincture of Spanish juice of Liquorice) putting into
each bottle a Clove slit in two. This he took as his constant Drink, and the
same quantity was four times repeated; but at Meat I sometimes permitted him a
glass of Wine or Hippocras.

3. Every seventh day, I purged him with a Tincture of my Family Pills, by
which a large quantity of cold, pituitous, and slimy matter was brought away:
he took it with observation as in other purges: and at a months end, I caused
him to sweat very well with Bezoar mineral, in Hartmans chair, being heat with
rectified Spirit of Wine: he continued nere an hour in the Chair, and then went
into a warm Bed, where afterward he sweat again plentifully.

4. During the time of his sweating I corroborated his Spirits with this
Cordial: Take spirit of Saffron, three ounces: Cinnamon Water, four ounces:
Syrup of Citron-peels, two ounces: Bawm or Mint-water, two ounces: mix them
together in a glass by shaking, Of this he now and then took a spoonful in the
time of his sweating, when he found himself to grow faint.

5. Every Morning fasting, I caused him to take the Magistral Spirit of
Earthworms, in a glass of Hippocras: at Noon he took half an ounce of the
spirit of Juniper Berries in the same Vehicle, a little before Dinner: and at
Night going to Bed this following Bolus: Take Extracts of Saffron, of Gentian,
of Contrayerva, of Angelica-roots, of Peony-roots, and of Juniper Berries, of
each half a scruple: volatile Salt of Hartshorn, sixteen grains: mix them
together. Having swallowed it down, he drank after it a glass of Hippocras, and
so composed himself to rest.

6. Outwardly I caused the Paralytick members to be well anointed with this
following Oil: Take Oil of Ben, a pound: Oils of Juniper Berries, and of
Rosemary, of each three ounces: mix them together, with this he was well
anointed, Morning and Evening for about a week, then was applied over all the
palsied parts the Ceratum Paralyticum Riverij, which was renewed every fourth
day, and ten times repeated; but with this direction, that every time before
the application of the new Cere-cloth, the said palsied parts were first bathed
with the Oil above mentioned. See the said Cerate in Our Doron Medicum, lib. 3.
cap. 5. sect. 11.

7. The Contraction on the left Hand was cured by this mixture: Take Palm Oil,
six ounces: Chemical Oil of Aniseeds, three ounces: mix them well together: By
the constant anointing with this Oil the contracted parts were after a
marvelous manner restored to their pristin state; for Oil of Aniseeds has a
specific virtue and power, in helping and healing almost all disaffections of
the Nerves, chiefly where Contractions and Convulsions are praevalent, by the
use of these things, the young Man was restored to his perfect health.

VIII. A Palsy in a middle aged Woman with obstruction of her Courses, and a
Dropsy.

1. This Woman being nere forty years of age, through an extreme Cold which she
took in Traveling was seized with a Palsy, together with a great obstruction
of her Courses: she fell under several Physicians Hands, who being ignorant of
the cause of her Disease, or true state of her Body, gave her many things but
all in vain: at length, her Disease continuing upon her, she fell withal into
a Dropsy, her whole Body being very much swelled from Head to Foot, so that
all her learned Doctors which then frequented her, declared her uncurable.

2. In this miserable condition by the advice of Friends, she made her
application to me. Her state of body was truly deplorable and dangerous; yet by
the following means she was (in no long time) restored to her perfect health.
That the obstruction of the Terms might contribute much to her present
distemper, not any that understands the Art of Physic, can make any doubt: In
consideration whereof, I thought it necessary first to provoke them, which I
did by giving this following Bolus, some few days before the full Moon: Take
Electuarium Diacarthamum, one dram: fine Aloes in Powder, half a dram: mix them
together. This she took late at Night going to bed, and it wrought early the
next Morning, she drinking then a little Posset Drink, to make it work the more
pleasantly: It gave her eight stools, and brought away many windy and watery
excrements: This she took every other day for about six times, save the Dose of
the Aloes was after the first time augmented to two scruples.

3. By the often exhibition of this Purge, her Courses were at length provoked,
and they came down very plentifully and well, by which she received much
benefit and comfort: Moreover by this continual purging her hydropical
Distemper was manifesty diminished though not perfectly taken away: now whilst
her Courses were coming down, I desisted the aforesaid purging: but to promote
them the more effectually, during the whole time of their flowing, I caused her
to take half a spoonful of Elixir Proprietatis in a glass of Rhenish or
White Wind, Morning and Night.

4. There are many other things which are thought powerfully to provoke the
Terms in Women, but I have truly found nothing so effectual as fine Aloes; for
that, by a certain specific Force, opens the mouths of all the sanguiferous
Vessels, chiefly in the lower parts; and performs that in five or six times
taking, which other Medicaments (designed for the same purpose) will not do in
twenty times.

5. The time of the flowing of her Courses being over, I purged her every
fourth or fifth day with the Tincture of our Family-Pills, which wrought upon
her commonly eight ten or twelve times, so that the Flood of her hydropical
humors was in a manner wholly taken away, and that extreme swelling, which
everywhere appeared before, now vanished: nevertheless I took care so to
strengthen the Viscera, that by an error in their weakness the Disease might no
more return.

6. For this Purpose in the intervals of purging I gave this following Bolus
Morning and Evening: Take Extracts of Gentian, of Zedoary, of Centory the less,
of Virginian-snake-root, of Contra-yerva, of Saffron, of each an ounce: Powder
of Cloves, Nutmegs, and Cinnamon, of each half an ounce: Cubebs, Anacardiums,
Myrrh, of each in fine Powder three drams: Bezoar mineral, Cochenele,
Winters-Cinnamon, Oil of Wormwood of each two drams: black and long Pepper, of
each one dram: mix and make an Electuary, of this about two drams was given her
every Morning and Night: immediately after the swallowing of which she drank
this: Take Hippocras, three ounces: Spirit of Saffron, six drams: mix them for
a draught.

7. By the taking of this Medicament she found her inward Parts so strengthened,
and the whole universal Frame so corroborated, that the fears of an hydropical
Relapse were wholly taken away: and truly she conceived herself somewhat the
better as to her Palsy also.

8. But that we might now apply our selves to the removal of the paralytick
Distemper, which seemed to have seized all the extreme Parts of the Body; I
first caused her hair to be shaved off toward the hinder part of her Head,
where I applied a large Vesicatory: It was the common Veficatory of the Shops,
and was laid on late at Night going to bed, viz. nere twelve a clock, and
continued on till about two in the Afternoon the next day, at which time I
removed it, and applied over a Melilot Emplaster: This was four times renewed
upon the same place, at about eight days distance, to wit, when the sore was
completely healed up, and the tenderness of the skin a little passed off.

9. Besides the former Blisters, I caused Blisters to be drawn in like manner
upon the Nucha or Nape of the Neck, as also upon both the Shoulders, which were
each three times repeated, at fit Intervals of time; by means of which a vast
quantity of a cold, viscous, and watery humor was drawn away, and the
Paralytick Parts seemed to be discharged of the ma^ter offending them.

10. After these Blisters were drawn and healed up, I caused all her Backbone
from the highest Vertebra of the Neck to the Os Coccygis to be anointed Morning
and Noon with this following Oil: Take Oil of Ben, six ounces: chemical Oil of
Nutmegs, two ounces and half: Oil of Cloves, two drams: mix them well together
for the purpose aforesaid. Moreover with the said Oil I caused all the
paralytick Parts also to be anointed twice a day, which continued for about
seven weeks, at which time she came to the perfect sense and use of her Limb;
but her strength was not yet completely restored.

11. To add the Complement of her strength, I prescribed outwardly to both her
weaks Limbs a strong Tincture of Myrrh, for eight or ten days, during which
time she took this following Mixture now and then a spoonful or two at a time,
to wit, three, four, or five times a day, as her self best liked: Take choice
Cinnamon Water, eight ounces: Angelica-Water, the greater Composition, Spirit
of Saffron, of each three ounces Juice of Alkermes, four ounces: mix all
together, and dulcify it with the Syrup of Citron-Peels, to the liking of the
sick. By the constant and regular use of these Medicaments, this miserable
Woman was perfectly restored, the complication of her Disease was removed, and
she reduced to her pristine health. What great things are accomplished by small
and light means, when rihgtly adapted or fitted to the intentions of healing,
and supposed incurable Diseases (as it were) silently conquered and overcome?

IX. A Youth of fourteen years of age by sitting in the Snow, was taken with
the Palsy.

1. This Youth being of a sudden taken with a Palsy by taking cold in the
Snow, was committed to the care of an old Woman, who anointed all the paralytick
limbs which were only on the right side with Oil of Bays, which she did for six
or eight weeks, but without the least appearance of amendment.

2. Then a Country Apothecary was sent for, who anointed him for several weeks
longer with Oil of Camomil and Vnguentum Excestrence; he also applied
Emplastrum de Baccis Lauri, all over the affected parts, but all this was don
for a long time without the least symptom of a good effect.

3. Being at that time accidentally in the place: They desired my advice and
help: I first of all caused him to be well cleansed from all the filthy
medicaments with which he had been so long time dawbed, which was performed
with a warm bath of Venice Soap, made of Spring Water to every gallon of which,
I caused them to add a pint of Proof Spirit of Wine: with this he was well
washed and bathed for almost an hour, with good frictions with course Cloths.

4. Being taken out of the Bath and dried, I caused him to be put into a very
warm Bed, and all his Backbone and palsied Members to be bathed with the Queen
of Hungaries water: and when he came out of his Bed, he was bathed or anointed
again with this following Oil: Take Oil of bitter Almonds, eight ounces:
Chemical Oils of Rosemary and of Rue, of each four ounces: mix them together,
to anoint the Paralytick parts with. With the use of this in about three weeks
time the Youth was restored to his Health, without the use of any other means
save the Queen of Hungaries water, which he took an ounce at a time Morning,
Noon and Night, in Hippocras, during the time of the Cure.

X. A Palsy of the upper parts, with Convulsions of the Stomach and Mesentery,
Worms, etc.

1. A Woman about thirty six years of age was taken with a Palsy of the upper
parts, on both sides, which was complicated with strange Convulsions both of
the Stomach and Mesentery, besides which, she had been observed several times
to avoid Worms: she had strange fits, commonly called Hysteric, which
afflicted her with that violence, that the bystanders for the most part
doubted of her every coming out of them, in which the Stomach or cavity of the
Thorax, became so extremely tumified, or swelled up, that it was even almost
beyond belief; so that had the exact relation thereof been given me, I should
have indeed doubted the Truth thereof, had I not beheld it with my own Eyes.

2. In the Intervalls of these fits, she for the most part complained of the
great Pain and gnawing at Stomach, which sometimes used to be so vehement and
extreme, that she would even desire to die rather than to live: Moreover she
had a symptomatical vomiting, which always afflicted her at set times, so that
she could tell before hand when a fit thereof would take her.

3. Now the cause of the vomiting was without doubt, from preaeternatural
matter offending the nervous Tunicles of the Stomach, which matter might be
either those Maw-worms, the principal cause of that Pain she complained of, or
from some sharp humor, collected or bred there: but the cause of the periodical
vomiting, came from a new aggression of matter; for after the matter at present
offending, was cast forth by the force of vomiting, she seemingly became well
as to that, nor had she any more inclination thereto, till the periodick time
returned again, which was commonly once in six or seven days; but the Pain of
her Stomach (occasioned by the Worms, still continued.)

4. But that we might be a little more curious than ordinary, we a little
Mathematically considered the cause thereof; and we found the vomiting fit
always or for the most part took her upon the Moons approach to the
Conjunction, Quartil and Opposition of Saturn, from whence I concluded that it
was a cold, sour, unpleasant, heavy, melancholy humor, which at those times was
congregated together and afflicted her.

5. That she had certainly worms was very evident, not only from that gnawing
at Stomach, which she daily complained of, but also from the coming away of
them at several times both by vomit, and stool, and she often evacuated them
upon taking of the Juice of Centory the less, which she was advised to by an
old Woman.

6. Having considered and well weighed her Distemper with the complications
thereof, I began the Cure with purging, the which I performed with my Family
Pills with Aloes: she took them seven several times, and they brought away from
her about seventeen or eighteen long Worms, of about seven or eight inches
long: I have given them several times for this very occasion with very great
success: whilst I was writing over this observation, viz. 15. November 1683. I
had a Letter sent to me from one Mr John Cordel, of St. Jves in
Huntinton-shire, with the following account.

7. Sir, -- Your Pills begin now to be in request: the first box that I sold of
them, brought from the Man that took them, about thirty Worms, some of them was
half a yard long; and one of them was eight foot and half long, it was measured
by a Carpenters Rule.

8. Now as to the Periodical vomiting, I conceived it in vain, to attempt the
cure thereof by Emeticks simply, for that upon the revolution of certain times
it exactly returned again, which made me believe the Distemper proceeded from a
general Discrasy of the Blood, not a simple disaffection of the part, and
therefore that we ought to amend the general habit of the whole Body, rather
than apply ourselves to the peculiar symptom.

9. For the removal of this cause therefore, I gave such things as had a mighty
power to alter the Blood: among Vegetables, I chose the Virginian Snake-root,
because of its singugular virtue in overcoming the Poison of the Rattle-Snake,
which it performs in a moment, (and besides which no other vegetable upon earth
is yet known to have power to answer that intention) notwithstanding the Poison
of the Rattle-Snake transcends almost infinitely the power of all other Poisons,
Vegetable, Mineral or Animal and transfuses its mortal malignity, by
contaminating the whole mass of Blood and nervous juice, and so extinguishing
the vital flame.

10. Among Animalls, I made choice of the Viper and Toad, because of their
admirable effects, the one in curing of a Leprosy though radicated, which is an
universal disaffection and contamination of all the juyces in the whole Body:
the other, to wit, that of the Toad, in amending the watery disposition of the
mass of Blood, and taking away its evil and malign quality in the case of a
Cancer, which Experience has confirmed it has performed with a marvelous
dexterity beyond all other things.

11. Among M^nerals I chose Gold and Antimony; the one for its infinite
diffusive power; the other for its admirable effects; not only of purifying
Gold it self; but also of cleansing and altering the whole mass of Blood in
Man's body, which it singularly performs beyond any other Mineral whatsoever,
being also a great friend to nature, and (as it were) a kind of natural Balsam
to the humane life, correcting all its exorbitancies, healing its
disaffections, and restoring and comforting one of its Essential parts (to wit)
the Radical Humidity.

12. From these reasons I made of the choice of the aforesaid particulars; and
out of them such Preparations as might be most condusive to the removing of the
present Malady, with respect also to the Paralytick Distemper: Of the
Virginian-snake-root, I made a Tincture in rectified Spirit of Wine, and also
an Extract: Of the Viper, Viper-Wine, and also a Powder of Vipers. Of the Toad,
a Salt of Toads. Of Gold, an Aurum Potabile. And of Antimony, Basil Valentine
his Tincture.

13. Out of these things I compounded these following Medicaments, first an
Extract: Take Extract of Virginian-snake-root of a middle consistency, six
ounces: Powder of Vipers, three ounces: Salt of Toads, half an ounce: Aurum
Potabile, two drams: mix them, and bring it into the just consistency of an
Electuary by adding a sufficient quantity of the Tincture of Antimony. This
Electuary the Patient took every Night going to bed, the quantity of two drams
at a time or better, drinking after it a glass of Viper-Wine, and continued the
use thereof so long till the whole quantity thereof was spent.

14. Secondly, a liquid Mixture: Take Viper-Wine, from two to three ounces:
Tincture of Virginian-snake-root, Tincture of Antimony, of each two drams:
Aurum Potabile, ten drops: mix them for a Dose to be given every Morning
fasting, and to be continued every day, so long a^ the former Electuary lasts:
by the use of these things the Blood became truly purified, and the periodical
vomiting was perfectly taken away, and truly (with the use of Topics also, as
follows) the Paralytick Distemper was completely cured.

15. But notwithstanding all these things we were not unmindful of the
miserable Convulsions of the Mesentery, which were attended with manifold
symptoms; and therefore while the other Medicaments were exhibited, these
following things were given in the intervals between Morning and Night: Take
choice Venice Treacle, one dram: Musk, fourten grains: Ambergrise, six grains:
Indian green Ginger, three drams: mix and make a Bolus, adding a little
quantity of juice of Alkermes. This she took every day, an hour before Dinner,
for eight days, drinking after it this: Take choice Hippocras, Orange
flower-water, of each four ounces: mix them for a draught.

16. About four in the Afternoon she took this mixture: Take choice Hippocras,
six ounces: Powers of Caraways, Powers of sweet Fennel-seed, of each thirty
drops: mix them for a draught: By the use of these things, together with
bathing the whole region of the Abdomen with Powers of Aniseeds, Morning and
Night, these dreadful Convulsions of the Mesentery where not only in a very
short time much diminished, but also in no long time, viz. in less than forteen
days wholly taken away.

17. But whereas she was very apt to be bound in Body, and extremely afflicted
with Wind, I prescribed this following Clyster, to be exhibited once in two
three four or five days, as the necessity of the sick required. Take
Mutton-Broth, a pint: Honey, Oil Olive, of each three spoonfuls: Powers of
Caraways, and Aniseeds, of each half a spoonful: mix them and exhibit it warm.

18. Outwardly as Topics, all the upper part of the Spina Dorsi was twice a
day, viz. Morning and Night bathed with this mixture. Take Powers of Amber, of
Aniseeds of sweet Fennel-seeds, of Rosemary, of Lavender, of Savin, of each one
ounce: Powers of Nutmegs, and of Cloves, of each half an ounce: mix them to
bath withal, as aforesaid.

19. The Paralytick Parts were first well rubbed with a course Cloth; then
fomented with Spirit of Wine, for almost an hour together; then well anointed
with this Oil: Take pure Oil of Ben, eight ounces: chemical Oils of Rosemary,
Sassafras, and Juniper Berries, of each an ounce: Oil of Aniseeds, half an
ounce: mix them well together: with this the extreme Parts were well anointed
twice a day, from the very beginning of the Cure to the confirmation thereof,
which was in about twelve weeks time, or somewhat more.

20. Lastly, for her constant drink, I ordered an ordinary Decoction of
Guajacum, Sassafras, and Sarsaparilla, to which was added as a Complement;
Spanish Juice of Liquorice, Raisons of the Sun, Figs, Coriander seeds,
Aniseeds, Caraways; It was made in half Water, half White Wind, the Wine being
added a little before the end of the boiling: this she took as her ordinary
drink; by the due use of these things according to the course afore-prescribed,
she was restored to her perfect health, in the time above limited.

XI. A Palsy in a Man about five and forty years of age.

1. This Man being of a middle age, and of a pituitous constitution of Body,
going a long Journey in a wet Season, got a very great Cold, whence followed a
vehement Catarrh, the Catarrh being unadvisedly stopped by receiving the Fumes of
Amber into the Mouth by a Funnel, he was taken with a numbness, and impotency
of motion, and became in a very little time extremely paralytick in all Parts.

2. By the advice of a Quack-salver they applied almost all over him Cataplasms
of Turnips boiled, but without Success: Yea, so far was it from doing good,
that he received much prejudice therefrom; for the Cataplasm not long after
growing cold, and not being presently renewed, he added to his former
Distemper, and made his Paralysis much worse than it was before: whereupon some
of his Relations sending for me, I prescribed him the following Things.

3. Take Treacle Water, magistral Water of Earthworms, of each four ounces:
Spirit of Angelica the greater Composition, two drams: Spirit of Sal Armoniack,
sixteen drops: mix them for a draught: he took it in the Evening, and sweat
upon it very well: The next Night I gave it again with this following Bolus:
Take Venice-Treacle, half a dram: Oriental Bezoar, Mineral Bezoar, of each
eight grains: mix them: this sweat more powerfully, as we desired it: and it
was twice again repeated, each at six days distance.

4. In the mean season, we ordered from the highest Vertebra of the Neck, to
the Os Coccygis, to be very well anointed twice a day, with this Compositum.
Take Oils of Hypericon, and of Castor, of each four ounces: chemical Oils of
Rosemary, of Savin, of Sassafras, and of Lavender, of each six drams: Powers of
Amber, an ounce: Spirit of Sal Armoniack, seven drams: mix them together, and
anoint therewith.

5. He also took as a Diet, a Guajacum-Decoction thus made: Take Raspings of
Guajacum, eight ounces: Bark of the same, three ounces: Raspings of Sassafras,
and of Juniper-wood, of each four ounces: boil all in springwater, eight
quarts: in a proper Diet-pot, three or four hours; then add thereto these
following; Juniper-herries, roots of Angelica, Peony-seeds, all very well
bruised of each two ounces: leaves of Sage, Rosemary, Marjoram, Time, of each a
handful: choice Sena, three ounces: boil them again in the said Diet pot, close
shut with its Cover, or rather covered with a Head having a Neck and Receiver,
that what ascends may be saved, and put it into it at the end of the boiling;
boil all together till five quarts only remain: being strained and settled, add
thereto, magistral Spirit of Earthworms, Spirit of Angelica, Aqua Caelestis,
of each two ounces and half: Spirit of Sal Armoniack, two drams and half: mix
them: and put all into a stone-bottle, which stop close for use. Of this
Decoction he took about four ounces three or four times a day, and it very
gently and pleasantly moved his Body downward.

6. But notwithstanding this Diet, he took once a week, a Dose of our
Family-Pills with A^oes, which wrought very well with him gave him about eight
or ten stools, and sensibly called the morbifick or offending matter from all
the extreme Parts of the Body, by which he confessed he found a very singular
Advantage.

7. Whilst all these things were doing, I caused all the paralytick Parts to be
very well anointed Morning and Evening with this following Oil, Take Oil of
Hypericon, ten ounces: Oils of Amber, and of Rosemary, of each two ounces: Oil
of Limons, one ounce: Powers of Juniper, three ounces: Spirit of Sal Armoniack,
ten drams: mix them well together by shaking, and anoint therewith as before
ordered.

8. When the former Diet was spent, I prescribed him the following Wine. Take
Rosemary, and Flowers of Rosemary, Sage, Time, Lavender-Flowers, Origanum,
sweet Marjoram, of each a handful: roots of Angelica, Peony, Masterwort,
Florentine-Orrice, black Hellebor, seeds of Carthamus, of each three drams:
Hermodactils, two ounces: white Agarick, Sena, of each half an ounce:
Cardamums, Cubebs, Anacardiums, Salt of Tartar, of each two drams: the
Ingredients being cut and grossly bruised, they were put into a Bag with a
stone in it, and infused some days in a Gallon of Rhenish-Wine: after four or
five days, it was gently strained out, and kept in a Bottle close stopped.

9. Of this Wine he took an hour before eating, three times a day, viz.
Morning, Noon, and Night; but at time of taking thereof, there was always
added, to about half a pint thereof, more or less, about ten drops of Spirit of
Sal Armoniack: and by the constant use of these things, in about twenty weeks
time, he was restored to his perfect health.

10. A certain Woman of about thirty years old, being in like manner taken
paralytick, through an extreme Cold, was cured by the same means, save in stead
of the former Oils she only used this Mixture: Take Oil of Ben, eight ounces:
chemical Oils of Juniper Berries, and of Savin, of each three ounces and an
half: Oil of Rosemary, one ounce: Oil of Cammomil, half an ounce: mix them:
with this all her Back and paralytick Members were very well anointed twice a
day, and she became perfectly well in a little more than twelve weeks time.

XII. A Palsy in an ancient Gentlewoman, which was mortal.

1. A Gentlewoman nere seventy years of age was taken with the Palsy, and
continued Paralytick almost two whole years, during which time, many Physicians
were called, and variety of Medicaments were used, but to no effect; for
notwithstanding all things which were applied, she grew worse and worse.

2. At length some of her relations desired that I should be sent for,
requesting my Opinion, and help, if I thought it possible to do her any good.
When I came to her, I beheld her as a true object of Pity: for besides her
Paralysis, she was mightily afflicted with wind in her Bowels, which oftentimes
vehemently tore her, nor could she eat any Food, her Stomach was so mightily
weakened, partly with the Disease, and partly with the nauseating Medicaments,
which had been before plentifully given her.

3. Her exceeding great age and weakness, made me very much fear that she would
never be cured; but because as the proverb is, while there is life there is
hope, and because her relations were very earnest with me to do something for
her, I prescribed the following things: first, I ordered all the Paralytick
parts as also the Spina dorsi to be very well bathed with the Powers of
Nutmegs; and sometimes with the Powers of Limons: but whatsoever we did, as
relating to the Paralysis availed nothing, for she rather grew worse and worse,
yet however we continued the use of the most proper Medicaments.

4. Inwardly because of the extreme weakness of her Stomach, I prescribed this
following water to be constantly given her four five or six times a day, or as
often as she desired it, by the assiduous use of which she found her Stomach to
be much restored, and by means thereof she begun to eat her food indifferent
well: Take choice Cinnamon Water, ten ounces: Angelica-water the greater
composition, Aquae vitae Matthioli, of each four ounces: Spirit of Saffron, two
ounces: mix them tog there, of this she took now and than a spoonful as it best
pleased her.

5. Moreover because of the Cholick which was familiar to her, I prescribed her
this following Dose to be taken every Morning and Evening: Take choice
Hippocras, four ounces: Powers of Carraway, sixty drops: Powers of Cloves, ten
drops: mix them together, this she took in the Morning fasting, and last at
Night going to Bed, by the use of which in the space of five or six days, her
Cholick wholly left her.

6. Her Cholick being thus taken away, and the weakness of her Stomach amended,
she now entertained hopes of recovery; but as to my own particular thoughts,
her great age, and other weaknesses, wholly disheartened me: However we
constantly continued the use of the former things, by which her appetite
continued also with her, and she remained free from the griping Pains of the
Bowels: after this manner she subsisted bedrid for more than a whole year.

7. In this Bedridden condition, she at length became much oppressed with Phlegm,
and many times in danger of being choked: at last a fierce Catarrh seized her,
which giving no time to provide against it, suffocated her a little after
midnight, and in less than forty eight hours after its first taking her. After
she was dead, about three pints or more of Phlegm and Water came forth at her
Nose.

XIII. A Palsy in a young Woman with Cholick Pains, and retention of her
Courses.

1. A young Woman of about thirty years of age, having a Scorbutic habit of
Body, took a Surfit, by drinking a large quantity of cold small Beer, in the
heat of Summer, at Haymaking, and when she was almost in a melting heat: A
while after she had taken it she grew sick, and in about two or three hours
after vomited exceedingly, all her Limbs, grew numb and stiff, and in less than
twenty four hours, vehement Pains seized her all over, from Head to Foot, so
that she seemed to have no place free: in this condition she lay in great
Torment, for about three weeks or somewhat more, at length her Pains left her of
their own accord, and she became every where Paralytick: But the Cholick seized
her to that degree of extremity, that she dispaired of life, nor could her
Physicians give her any ease; so that it seemed that all the Pains in the
extreme parts, upon their removal thence, took possession of the Bowels.

2. Upon this occasion her Courses also stopped upon her for more than ten months
time, so that indeed, there was a complication of Diseases, which required the
help of a truly skilful Physician to remove it. She had tampred with many
Doctors for nere a year together, but without any hopes of amendment, for they
were all to her, Physicians of no Value.

3. The most vehement symptoms urged our first consideration, which was that of
the Cholick, and therefore I gave her for several days an infusion of Rhubarb
thin sliced and bruised in choice Canary: Take of the best Sack a quart:
Rhubarb thin sliced and bruised, four ounces: digest forty eight hours, then
decant off the clear Wine, of which give three ounces at a time, twice a day,
viz. Morning and Night, putting into each dose sixty drops of Powers of
Caraways: By the use of this thing alone, she had ease in a little time, and in
something less than three weeks time, this excruciating Cholick was perfectly
removed.

4. From hence the reason was apparent why her former Doctors could give her no
relief in her Cholick Pains, for that there was an offending matter to be
carried off, and they only gave her before Carminatives, which did her no good
but for the present, for as soon as ever the power and force of the Medicament
was gone, the Cholick returned again, and that with grater vehemence.

5. And though possibly they might sometimes give several purgatives, yet they
never did any good, for that they for the most part cleansed the Bowels even to
corrosion, which were now by the violence of the Disease not only mightily
weakened, but by reason of the Blood, and bloody matter, which frequently came
from her, there was a very great suspicion of Exulceration: and therefore it
was requisite not only to cleanse the Guts: and that gently too, but to do it
with such a Cathartick, as might have a healing and astringing property withal.

6. Fo this purpose I knew nothing better than Rhubarb, which besides its
purgative quality, has a specific Virtue in curing of Cholicks: This
Medicament was given her as before mentioned till the Cholick was perfectly
removed from her: but over and besides that, I caused it to be infused in all
the drink she drank, yea in all her small drink, which she frequently had
against the wills of all about her.

7. However fearing that the retention of her Courses might contribute something
to those gripings, we took care to force them down, which we performed with
this Bolus: Take fine Aloes in powder, half a dram: Saffron, Aron-roots, both
in powder, of each fifteen grains: black Pepper, five grains: Honey a
sufficient quantity: mix and make a Bolus, for one dose. This was repeated five
times, at two or three days distance: she began to take it presently after the
last quarter of the Moon; and before the first quarter of the Moon, they
appeared, and came down plentifully, and of a good color; and so continued to
come down at their due times.

8. These things being done, We now applied our help to the removing of the
Paralysis, which we performed with the following things. first, I purged her
with this: Take Rosin of Jalap, Aloes, Agarick, of each six grains: Salt of
Amber, eight grains: Oil of Mint, two or three drops: mix and make thereof five
Pills: with this she was four times purged at six or seven days distance; and
by it she found a sensible good as to her Paralytick Distemper.

9. In the intervalls of Purging, I gave her this thrice a day: Take
Prophylactick water of Sylvius, or instead thereof choice Treacle-water, an
ounce and half: Magistral, water of Earthworms, Spiritus Lavendula, of each
half an ounce: water distilled from Onions, two ounces: Spirit of Sal
Armoniack, twelve drops: Syrup of Saffron, enough to make it pleasant, shake
them together; and give it for one dose. By the use of this thing she became
very chereful and lively; but she complained much of its sharpness, yet without
that it is much to be doubted, whether she might have done well or no: for
these kind of things have not only a mighty power in opening all manner of
obstructions, but also have a specific virtue in curing of Palsies, and most
other cold and moist distempers of the Brain and Nerves.

10. But sometimes for change of Medicaments, in the place of the last this
following was exhibited: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, a dram and half: Salt of
Amber, Salt of Hartshorn, volatile Sal Armoniack, of each six grains: mix them
for a Dose to be given at Night going to bed, drinking after it this following:
Take Hipprocras, four or five ounces: Spirit of Vipers, one dram: Powers of
Vipers, twelve drops: mix them for a draught. The taking of this Medicament
presently put the universal Frame of the Body into a notable heat (yet not so
great as to cause Inflammation or a Fever) whereby the too much chilled and
coagulated particles of the neurotick Juice became resolved, and those
obstructions of the Nerves removed, which in part hindered the free afflux of
the animal Spirit:

11. Now during all this time, we caused her to be anointed all over the
paralytick Parts, as also along the Spina Dorsi, with this compound Oil: Take
Oil of Ben, twelve ounces: chemical Oils of Rosemary, of Savin, of
Juniper Berries, and of Sassafras, of each an ounce and half: Oil of Limons,
two ounces: mix them together to anoint with, as before directed; this was
constantly done twice a day, so long till such time, as she perceived her Palsy
to be removed, which was in about fourteen weeks time: but in the last fourteen
days of the using thereof there was mixed therewith (as it was used) to every
ounce of the Oil one dram of the Powers of Aniseeds, and half a dram of Spirit
of Sal Armoniack,

12. Lastly, for her common drink a small Decoction of Guajacum, Sassafras,
Sarsaparilla, and Acorus, was used adding to it as a Complement
Juniper Berries, Coriander-seeds, Caraways, Aniseeds, and Juice of Liquorice,
and toward the end of the boiling a third part of White Wine, then straining,
sweetning it with Sugar, and bottling it up with a Clove slit in two in each
Bottle. This she took every day constantly as her ordinary drink: into every
draught of which, as she drank it, sixteen drops of the Tincture of Castor was
dropped. And after the anointing was over; all those members where the Palsy had
lately been, and which had been weakened by it, were very well bathed Morning
and Night with a strong Tincture of Mirrh, made with Spirit of Wine, for about
ten or twelve days together: Thus by the use of these means was this miserable
creature restored to her perfect health in about sixteen weeks time, and
remained so, for several years after.

XIIII. A Palsy in a Gentleman, occasioned by taking cold in swiming.

1. A young Man taking cold in swiming, was at first taken with a kind of
Convulsive motions, but at length it proved to be Paralytick, for that he was
deprived of all motion in his Hands and Feet; and his sense of Feeling was much
impared also, which without controversy was occasioned from the coldness of the
water: for that it is the nature of things over-cold to thicken the humors and
render them slow in motion, and by congealing the nervous juice, and clouding
or thickning the Spirits, to hinder their free passage into the sensitive
parts, whereby many times the Animal flame in some particular places becomes
extinguished.

2. His Physicians which he first sent for, first prescribed him a set Diet:
then they both vomited him, and purged him with several sorts of Medicaments:
they apply fomentations to the Spina Dorsi, and also to the Paralytick parts:
Likewise they anointed him with several Ointments and Balsams made of Gums,
Spices, and hot Galenick Oils: but these things doing no good, they sent him to
the Bath; then sweat him with Venice Treacle, Treacle-water, and other things,
but all to no purpose, so that they then gave him over as incurable.

3. Being advised by some Friends to make trial of me, I enquired into all that
had been don, and they gave me the former relation, whereby I perceived, that
the things which had been used, proved ineffectual by reason of their weakness,
and misapplication.

4. I therefore first purged him with the Tincture of Our Family Pills, which
purge was repeated once a week for twenty weeks: but sometimes (though not
often) he took the Pills themselves: these purges brought from him a large
quantity of cold, slimy, and viscous humors, and sometimes water in great
abundance: three or four times, they also gave him two or three vomits.

5. I ordered him this following Diet: Take Guajacum, Sarsaparilla, Sassafras,
Acorus, of each eight ounces: boil all in six quarts of water to four: then add
Aniseeds, Caraways, Coriander-seeds, Juniper Berries (all well bruised) of each
three ounces: Spanish juice of Liquorice, one ounce: Raisons of the Sun stoned,
Figs slit, of each half a pound: boil all till only three quarts remains, then
strain and let it settle: being clear, decant it off, dulcifie it with white
Sugar, and put it up into a stone bottle with two or three Cloves in it: Of
this he drank about three quarters of a pint Morning and Evening, with twelve
drops of the Spirit of Sal Armoniack in each draught:

6. But by reason he was vehemently afflicted with a violent Catarrh, whereby
he spit much every day; by an old Woman's advise he took the fumes of
Frankincense up his Mouth by a Funnel, whereby the Catarrh was stopped; but a
greater inconvenience presently fell upon him, for he was immediately taken
with vehement and running Pains all over his whole Body, so that he could not
rest either Night or Day: this was acted without my knowledge, not long after I
began the Cure; but seeing the ill success, they told me what they had done.

7. I was necessitated now to take new measures, for that the Catarrh was
fallen not only upon the extreme parts, but upon the Viscera also, for he was
exceedingly tortured in his Bowels, and the Cholick so far prevailed upon him,
that he was many times swooning away.

8. Inwardly, I gave him often in the Day the Infusion of Rhubarb in an
ordinary or small Guajacum decoction, with thirty, forty or more drops of
Powers of Caraways: Outwardly I caused Vesicatories to be applied to the Nucha,
to both Shoulders, and to his Hips: these were three times reiterated: and by
the seasonable and happy application thereof, the Rheumatism was at length
removed, and withal, the said Vesicatories very much contributed to the
retriving him out of his Paralytick Distemper, for after the Blisters had been
applied the third time he came in a good measure to the use of his Hands and
Feet.

9. Having thus removed his Rheumatism and Cholick, I ordered him Morning, Noon
and Night, viz. an hour before eating to take the Powers of Vipers in a glass
of Hippocras, whereby the whole Genus Nervosum was in an instant heat, as if
set on fire, yet without any danger of a Fever: he began with twelve drops,
and increased the dose by degrees, till such time as he took twenty four drops:
The virtue of this preparation of Vipers is so great, that it is scarcely to be
expressed; and in this Cure there was a demonstration thereof.

10. And truly the volatile Salt of Vipers is no ways inferior thereto, being
given in choice Cinnamon water: And one Patient (to wit) a young Lady, who was
taken with a Palsy on her right side, was perfectly cured by giving of it
inwardly in Aqua Celestis, twice a day, and bathing the Paralytick members
twice a day also with the Powers of Rosemary and Savin.

11. But to return to our young Gentleman again: Outwardly, I caused all his
Back as also all the Paralytick parts to be well bathed with this following
Oil: Take Oil of Ben, ten ounces: Chemical Oils of Rosemary, Rue, and Savin, of
each two ounces: Chemical Oil of Euphorbium, one ounce: mix them to anoint
with: this was used Morning and Evening, till such time as he was restored to
his former health.

12. But whereas he complained of a weakness of his Stomach and indigestion, I
caused him to drink sometimes Tinctures of Wormwood in choice Canary; and
sometimes the blood red Tincture of black Pepper, these things being used for
some time, sometimes the one, and sometimes the other, or alternatim, as he liked
best, he was in about five Months time restored to his health.

XV. A Palsy in a middle-aged poor Woman.

1. This Woman being about forty years old, was taken with a Palsy, by taking
of cold in washing of some Cloths: she could make use neither of Hands nor
Feet; but lay in that miserable condition for about six Months: yet not without
making trial of many things, to no purpose.

2. She was cured at last by taking inwardly only a strong Tincture of
Castoreum, with some drops of Spirit of Sal Armoniack two or three times a day,
and bathing the Backbone and all the paralytick Parts Morning and Evening with
the Queen of Hungaria's Water.

3. And after the same manner, with the same Medicament was a young Man cured
of a Palsy, after he had been eighteen Months afflicted therewith, and given
over as incurable.

XVI. A Palsy in a very fat Man of about forty years of age.

1. This Man being of a strong robust Body, and full of humors, took a Surfeit
by over-eating and drinking of himself, which after a while degenerated into a
Palsy, in which condition he lay for about five Months, notwithstanding variety
of Medicaments had been applied to him.

2. Finding him of a gross and foul Body, I first very well purged him with my
Family-Pills with Aloes; and sometimes with the Tincture of the same, by which a
vast quantity of Water, and other cold, viscous and pituitous matter was drawn
away: after he had taken this four times, I gave him a dram of the Extract of
Esula mixed with a little new-drawn Cassia; it was taken in the Morning, and it
purged him exceeding well.

3. I prescribed him also for a Diet this following Decoction: Take Guajacum
rasped, Acorus roots bruised, of each an ounce and half: mealy Sarsaparilla,
six ounces: infuse in warm Water, two quarts: then boil it half away or more;
nere the end of the boiling add White Wind, a pint and half: let it boil a
little, and then strain it out, which sweeten a little with white Sugar. Of
this he took half a pint in the Morning in his bed, with sixteen grains of
Bezoar mineral in a little Honey; and being well covered with Cloths, he sweat
well, and a long time together.

4. Every Morning he took three ounces of pure Cinnamon Water with six drops of
Spirit of Sal Armoniack, and ten drops of Spirit of Hartshorn: and an hour
before Dinner he took an ounce and half of Aqua Vitae Matthioli mixed with half
a dram of Spirit of Vipers: an hour before Supper the same thing was repeated
again: and about nine a clock at Night he took this Bolus: Take Electuarium ad
Tabidos, two drams: volatile Salt of Amber, one scruple: mix them.

5. Outwardly I caused the Spina Dorsi, and all the paralytick Members to be
very well fomented with Spirit of Wine: then bathed with the Powers of
Aniseeds: and after that to be anointed with this compound Oil: Take Oil of
Ben, eight ounces: chemical Oils of Cammomil, of Savin, of Rosemary, and of
Sassafras, of each one ounce: mix them well together in a glass by shaking:
this was done every Morning and Evening.

6. Moreover his Head was shaved and every part bathed with this Mixture: Take
Powers of Rhodium, Powers of Sassafras, of each an ounce: Powers of Musk, and
of Ambergrise, of each six drams: Powers of Nutmegs, half an ounce: mix them
being well bathed (which was done two or three times a day) it was kept warm
with a silk Cap, quilted with the chief Spices and pure Musk.

7. The use of these things brought him to his former health; but fearing least
he should relapse I prescribed him this following Water to be taken every
Morning fasting, and last at Night going to bed. Take magistral Spirit of
Earthworms, Spirit of Angelica the greater Composition, Aqua Vitae Matthioli,
choice Cinnamon Water, of each four ounces: Powers of Rosemary, two ounces:
Powers of Lavender, one ounce: Juice of Alkermes, three ounces: mix them very
well in a glass by shaking. Of this he took two spoonfuls at a time: also I
ordered him once a Month to take a Purge; which was that of the Tincture of our
said Family Pills.

XVII. A Palsy happening in a scorbutic habit of Body.

1. A Gentlewoman about thirty eight years of age, of a cold, gross pituitous,
and scorbutic habit of Body was seized with the Palsy on both Sides, so that
she had an impotency of motion both in her Hands and Arms, Legs and Feet,
whereby she became totally helpless, moreover she had a great weakness at
Stomach, so that whatsoever she took down, she for the most part vomited up
again.

2. Having lain about half a year in this distressed condition, she sent for
me: I enquired into the cause of her Disease, but could hear little, for that
it crept on her, as it were insensibly and by degrees, so that she was some
months before her distemper came to the height, it beginning first with a light
numbness then with a weakness, after that with an Impotency of motion first in
one part, then in another, till at length she became as aforesaid wholly
helpless, with a loss of Appetite.

3. Perceiving her habit of Body to be extremely scorbutic, (for she was
loaded with various colored spots in several parts of her Body, her Gums were
wasted, and her Teeth loose, with wandering Pains up and down) I judged it
highly necessary in the Cure, to mix Antiscorbuticks with Ant^paralyticks, and
especially such as were of a hot nature, for that the Scorbute seemed to be in
a cold habit.

4. I began with gentle purgations, which was performed with Sena and Rhubarb
infused in a weak spirit of Scurvy Grass: I purged her therewith at first twice
a week for a month together, afterward but once a week, which purgation was
continued during the whole time of the Cure.

5. In the Intervals of purging, I prescribed this following Julep to be taken
every Morning fasting: Take Aquae vitae Matthioli, two ounces: (spirit of
Earthworms, four ounces:) spirit of Scurvy Grass, six ounces: water of
Hydropiper, eight ounces: syrup of Citron-peels, six ounces: mix them well
together by shaking them in a Glass. Of this mixture she took three or four
spoonfuls at a time.

6. Nere Noon, to wit, an hour or thereabouts before Dinner, she took this:
Take Cinnamon Water, three drams: Water of Onions, one ounce: Salt of
Scurvy Grass, Carduus and Wormwood, of each four grains: syrup of Rosemary
flowers, an ounce and half: mix them for a dose. This caused a great
fermentation in the Stomach, and sometimes endangered vomiting; but by Dinner
time, the force of its operation would seem to be over, so as that the Sick
would eat a hearty meal, and with a singular appetite.

7. At Night going to Bed I prescribed this: Take Electuarium ad Tabidos, a
dram and half: salt of Scurvigrass, volatile salt of Hartshorn and of
Mans-skull, of each five grains: Oil of sweet Fennel-seed, eight drops, mix
them. This was given at going to Bed, so that she slept upon it, and it had a
very pleasant and sweet operation upon her, for it composed her to rest, and
withal enforced upon her a gentle Sweat: moreover the Oil of sweet Fennel seed
has a power of corroborating the Stomach, which is performed in part from the
suavity and gentle heat; for that it is observable that Oils of Aniseed and of
sweet Fennel-seed, have a natural and specific virtue to comfort and
strengthen the Nerves in particular, and Genus Nervosum in general; and the
Tunicles of the Stomach being composed of a nervous substance, and I fearing
there might withal be a Palsy of the Stomach, concluded; nothing could be
more proper than that thing of which I have had a large experience in outward
application against the Palsy: and truly at this time it was given with great
success.

8. For her constant drink, I ordered her a Guajacum-Diet, such as is
prescribed a Sect. XIII. 12. aforegoing, but not made too strong, so that she
even drank it also at meals: but in all she drank, at time of drinking of it
there was dropped about thirty or forty drops of pure Spirit of Scurvy Grass, and
sometimes Spirit of Horse-Radish-root, that withal we might encounter the
Scorbute at the same time. By the use of these things, the running and
Scorbutic Pains were perfectly removed, and she began to eat her Food well,
and with a Stomach, and withal the Paralysis in the extreme Parts evidently
vanished.

9. However during the performance of all these things, we were not unmindful
of applying fit Topics: and therefore I caused all the Spina Dorsi from the
highest Vertebra of the Neck, to the lowest of the Loins, as also all the
paralytick Members to be bathed with the Powers of sweet Fennel-seed, which was
done Morning and Night for seven or eight days: at the end of that time, we did
not only continue the use of the said Powers, as already related, but also
after the bathing was over anointed all those Parts with this following Oil:
Take Oil of Ben, fourteen ounces: Oils of Aniseeds, of Rosemary, of Lavender,
of Savin, of Sassafras, and of Limons, of each an ounce and half: Oil of
Caraways, one ounce: mix them well together by shaking in a glass. By the use
of these things, in about four Months time she was perfectly cured.

10. A young Woman of about seven and twenty years of age, and of an extreme
scorbutic habit of Body, was also completely restored by the Method above
prescribed, save in the internal Medicaments in stead of the Spirit of
Scurvy Grass and Horse Radish, there was used the Spirits of Water Cresses, and
of Mustard seed, which had full as great an Effect upon her as the other
Spirits had upon the other Woman, Moreover in stead of the last Topical Oil,
this following was used: Take Oil of Ben, twelve ounces: chemical Oil of
Rosemary, eight ounces: mix them together to anoint with, by the use of these
things she also was cured.

11. A Man also of about fifty years of age, extremely overgrown with the
Scurvy, becoming withal Paralytick was cured both of his Scurvy and Palsy, by
the former Method: save in stead of the Guajacum Diet he had only a Decoction
of Juniper Berries, made in half Water half Wine, which he took with Spirit of
Scurvy grass, as aforesaid: and in stead of the Powers of sweet Fennel-seed, he
bathed with the Powers of Caraways, and then anointed with this Oil: Take Oil
Olive, twelve ounces: Oil of Juniper Berries, five ounces: Oil of Limons, or of
Oranges, three ounces: mix them to anoint with.

12. A noble Youth through careless living acquired a Scorbutic habit, and by
taking an extraordinary Cold became Paralytick through his whole right Side:
many Galenick things had been used to him for six or seven Months time, but all
in vain, for the Physicians not perceiving a Scorbute to be joined with a
Paralysis, mistook their measures in the Cure: at length falling into our
hands, we cured him by the method above prescribed: Save in stead of the
Guajacum-Diet (which we could by no means persuade him to take) he took choice
Hippocras, with permission to drink now and then a draught of Beer.

XVIII. A Palsy in a middle-aged Woman, accompanied with a kind of Lethargy.

1. This Gentlewoman taking Cold in going along Journey, was seized with the
Palsy, and withal a kind of Lethargy: the Physicians of the place to which she
went, were consulted, but were at first at a stand what to do: at length they
gave her Julep of Roses inwardly, and anointed her outwardly with Vnguentum
Martiatum, Oleum Excestrense, and other the like Galenick Remedies, but without
the least appearance of good.

2. When the Country-Physicians could do her no kindness, her Husband brought
her to London, where he meet with other Asses of Aesculapius, who whiled away
several weeks in doing nothing at all: for all the things they applied to her
were wholly Galenical, so that having no power to penetrate into the root of
the matter, it was impossible they should ever effect the thing desired,
without the help of a Miracle.

3. These Tools proving all useless, (by the advice of a Friend) they sent for
me: having well viewed her I immediately perceived a Paralysis with a Lethargy:
the Gentlewoman was in a very dangerous Condition, so that she was not to be
played or dallied withal, but there was a necessity of speedily using some
powerful Medicines, especially such as might throw off her Lethargick
Disposition.

4, In the first place I purged her Head with solid Errhines, such as these
following. Take Confectio Hamech, half an ounce: Scammony, and Gutta Gamba both
in fine Powder, of each a like quantity so much as may make it up into a good
consistency for Pills: to every ounce of which you may add of Euphorbium in
fine Powder, half a dram. Of this there was long Pellets made to put up the
Nostrils, which were kept in with a Muffler put before the Nose, and pined from
Ear to Ear: this was done in the Evening, and the Errhines were kept-in about
an hour and half.

5. By the use hereof her Head was exceedingly well purged; and the operation
was four several times reiterated at two or three days distance, by which a
very vast quantity of cold pituitous matter was drawn away from her Head: after
the fourth time, we used the following liquid Errhine, which wrought yet more
powerfully upon her, and with less trouble. Take White Wind, a pint: choice
Euphorbium, two scruples in fine Powder: Cambogia, four scruples: make a
dissolution of the Gums over a gentle heat, and keep it in a glass closs stopped
for use. This was cast up the Nostrils with a Syring, and repeated thrice at
three days distance: by which her Head became effectually purged; and upon the
last exhibition thereof her Lethargy wholly left her, with great hopes of
amendment as to her Paralysis also.

6. But whilst all this was doing, I was not unmindful, to evacuate the whole
Body, of the cold morbifick matter with which it was afflicted: and this I
performed sometimes with the Tincture of my Family-Pill, and sometimes with an
Infusion of Rhubarb and Sena in a small Scurvy-grass-Water; this purging I
promoted every fourth, fifth or sixth day, as I saw occasion, and the strength
of her Body would bear.

7. In the intervals of purging I ordered her to take this following Mixture:
Take Cinnamon Water, an ounce: Basil's Tincture of Antimony, two drams: Powers
of Rosemary, one dram: Spirit of Sal Armoniack, ten drops: mix them together
for a Dose: This was given her every day (except the days of purging) three
times a day, viz. in the Morning fasting; an hour before Dinner, and at four a
clock in the Afternoon.

8. At Night going to bed, I prescribed her this Bolus. Take Electuarium ad
Tabidos, a dram and half: Bezoar mineral, sixteen grains: volatile Salt of
Mans-skull, volatile Salt of Amber, of each seven grains: with Juice of
Alkermes a sufficient quantity, make a Bolus, to be taken at bedtime: this
composed her Spirits, gave her good rest, and provoked a gentle kind of
sweating.

9. Her Diet was choice Hippocras, with permission to drink now and then, (yet
but seldom,) a draught of Beer or Ale; or a Decoction of Sarsaparilla in Water:
thus made: Take mealy Sarsaparilla split, two pounds: Caraway seeds bruised,
four ounces: Spring Water, sixteen quarts: boil the Sarsa in the Water till
near the consumption of the one half: then add the seeds, boil a quarter of an
hour longer, and take it off the Fire and strain it, which make pleasant with
white Sugar, and put it up into Bottles with a Clove in each Bottle, and keep
it for use.

10. Outwardly these Topics were applied: first the paralytick Members were
extremely well bathed with the Powers of Aniseeds, Morning and Night for six or
seven days: this being done, they were every day, twice a day anointed with
this following Oil. Take Oil of Castoreum, and Oil of Scorpions made as we have
directed in our Doron, Lib. 3. Cap. 2. Sect. 1. of each eight ounces: chemical
Oils of Rosemary, sweet Fennel seeds, Savin, and Limons, of each two ounces and
half: mix them well together in a glass by shaking.

11. By the use of this the palsied Parts were restored, but there yet remained
a very great weakness upon them which were thus remedied. Take fat Myrrh, make
it very soft and by adding a sufficient quantity of rectified Spirit of Wine
draw a blood red Tincture: to every ounce: of this Tincture add a ^ram of the
chemical Oil of Limons, which mix well together. With this being bathed for
some time, they were restored to their former strength.

12. But to prevent a Relapse, and because the sick was very apt to be sleepy,
I ordered the taking every Morning a little Sup of the Queen of Hungaria's
Water; and the same half an hour before Dinner, and to be repeated about four a
clock in the Afternoon: and at Night going to bed, this Electuary. Take Indian
preserved Nutmegs, number six: Indian preserved green Ginger, eight ounces:
candied Citron-Peels, four ounces: pure Indian-Oyl of Mace by Expression, two
ounces and half: beat all very well together in a Mortar, and with a sufficient
quantity of the Juice of Alkermes make an Electuary according to Art. Dose the
quantity of a Wall-nut at going to bed: This was taken near six weeks after the
Paralysis seemed to be perfectly taken away: and by the constant use of these
things for that time the Lethargick Disposition and Inclination were wholly
removed.

13. A beautiful young Lady, of about sixteen years of age, was by taking a
vehement Cold, seized both with a Lethargy and Palsy, who in about eight weeks
time was perfectly restored by the precedent Method, with very little
variation. The same Lady, after she seemed to be well cured of the aforenamed
Diseases became in one Night Dumb: This accident was removed by taking inwardly
this mixture, and also holding some of it for a little while in the Mouth. Take
Spirit of Angelica the greater composition, Aqua Vitae Matthioli, of each three
ounces: Powers of Rosemary, one ounce and half: mix them together: Dose two
drams to half an ounce, in Spirit of black Cherries, but she held it in her
Mouth without mixture, sometimes for a quarter of an hour together.

14. A Youth of about fourteen or fifteen years of age was so taken also, viz.
with a Palsy and a Lethargick Distemper; the Lethargy would sometimes seem to be
off; yet then he remained as it were foolish and void of his reason; and again
in a day or two the Lethargy would return: we cured him in about four Months
time, by the Method first above prescribed in this present Section, and with
the removal of his Distemper, his Understanding was also restored to him, as
perfect as formerly.

XIX. A Palsy in a Gentlewoman of about six and thirty years of age.

1. This Gentlewoman being seized with a great Cold in her lying-in, was
presently taken lame, and from thence became paralytick in all her extreme
Parts, so that she wholly lost the use of her Limbs: her Courses also were so
stopped upon her that they could not be produced for above fifteen Months; and
her Belly swelled as if she had had a Dropsy, or rather been with Child: her
Stomach likewise was impaired, so that she scarcely eat any thing but what came
up again; and she complained of a vehement grinding Pain in her Bowels or Womb,
and in the Reins of her Back.

2. In this distress she applied her self to several persons for remedy: she
took advise of her Midwife, and then of another Woman, who pretended to do
wonders; but all to no purpose, for she daily grew worse and worse: These
failing she sent for a Physician, who tampred with her for six or seven weeks
with as little success: at length two or three other Gentlemen were called to
consult withal, but yet notwithstanding all their endeavors, the event
answered not, nor indeed could they tell what their sick Patient ailed, but one
was of one opinion, and the other of another; however the Paralysis was evident.

3. Thus about forteen or fifteen months was elapsed without remedy, and the
poor Gentlewoman remained without hopes, for that such vast quantities and
numbers of things had been so long tried in vain; but the wonder when enquired
into soon ceased; for examining the Apothecaries file, I found such poor, low
spirited, and almost insipid things to be inwardly ministered; and such gross,
greasy, and abominabl^ nauseous fooleries outwardly applied, that I rather
began to wonder she was no worse; I imputed the misery she went through; and
the long hopeless Cure, to the ignorance of her Physicians, who had for so long
time attended her: which although it was with small advantage, or rather hurt
to her the distressed Patient, yet it was with a singular advantage and profit
to themselves who received all their Money and Fees not for doing nothing at
all, but rather for doing mischief, by bringing this mirable creature under the
terror of an Incurable Disease.

4. After a serious enquiry into the nature of her Distemper, it sufficiently
appeared, that taking cold was the remote cause of all her illness; And that
the obstruction of her Terms very much contributed to the augmentation of her
Disease: That her Disease was become stubborn and habitual, and that without
powerful remedies, and such as might be long taken, so as to alter the
universal habit, no hope of cure could be expected.

5. In order to this design, I first prescribed this following Decoction to be
taken as her constant and ordinary drink, (save at meals I permitted her to
drink a glass of Hippocras:) Take mealy Sarsaparilla, two pound:
Juniper Berries well bruised, a pound: infuse the sarsa, forty eight hours in
warm Water, sixteen quarts: then boil it away till the half be consumed: after
which add the berries, and boil again till two quarts more is wasted: this don
put thereto white Wine, two quarts: and boil again a walm or two, then take it
off, cool and strain it, and being settled, decant and dulcifie it, to the
liking of the sick, with double refined sugar, and bottle it up for use.

6. This was all the Drink she drank during her whole Cure, and she continued
the use of it for nine or ten months: it is almost incredible what good she
found by it, and that in a very short space, so that she confessed all the
grinding Pains in her Bowels, Womb, and Reins, were perfectly removed and that
in about three weeks time: but at time of drinking thereof, she for the most
part dropped into each draught fifteen twenty or twenty five drops of the Powers
of Caraways: by the constant drinking of this Liquor, her Courses also began to
appear, though but faintly.

7. Now the more powerfully to provoke them, I caused her to take every Night
going to bed (for about a weeks space before the time they used to flow) the
Angelick Pills of Grulingius to the quantity of two scruples, which excellently
purged her, and that without Pain, and according to our expectations they began
to flow, about the usual time, admirably well, both in quantity and color, by
which this poor Gentlewoman found very much relief: and to accustom them to the
due time of their flux, I caused her for two or three months one after another
to take for four or five days before hand the said Angelick Pills; so that at
length they were again reduced to their ordinary course.

8. By this time we began to be in hopes of a Cure, and the Patient herself
also encouraged us in Our undertaking; for now the great tumor of her Belly was
abated and gone, and she began to eat her Food indifferently well: but this is
to be understood, whilst all this was doing (having first cleansed her whole
Body from the filthy, greasy and nauseous Oils and Ointments, which they had
applied to her, by a proper bath made of Juniper Berries and spring water with
venice soap) I caused the whole region of the Abdomen to be Morning and Evening
bathed with the Powers of Aniseeds, sometimes alone, and sometimes mixed with
Powers of Fennel-seeds.

9. Moreover, as to the Paralysis we were not unmindful to administer proper
things; which were given her at three or four distinct times of the day. In the
Morning she took this following mixture: Take Aquae Coelesti, spirit of
Castoreum, of each one ounce: Powers of Vipers, twenty or twenty five drops:
choice Hippocras, two ounces: mix them for a draught. This warmed her all over,
and heat the whole Genus Nervosum, as if she had been by a good fire, yet as I
have formerly said, without the least danger of putting her into a Fever.

10. About an hour before Dinner she took this: Take Powers of Cinnamon, thirty
drops: spirit of Angelica the greater composition, spirit of black Cherries, of
each two ounces: mix them: this not only contributed to the restoring the
Nerves, and removing the paralytick affection, but also mightily strengthened
her Stomach, so that she in a little time after the use thereof eat and
digested her Food with a very good Stomach, and not only her vomiting but
loothing also left her.

11. About four a clock in the afternoon she took this: Take Basils Tincture of
Antimony, forty drops: Tincture of salt of Tartar, two drams: Powers of Vipers,
twenty drops: choice Hippocras, three or four ounces: mix them for a draught.
This warmed and heat her again all over, and that immediately, so that to feel
of her Hands or Face, she would be as warm, as if she had been heat by a fire:
such is the great force and virtue of the Powers of Vipers: for they
immediately put even the nervous juice into a kind of formentation, and warm,
comfort and excite the Animal Spirits above all other Medicaments whatsoever,
and therefore without controversy, very much conduce to the restoration of all
sorts of Paralytick persons.

12. At Night going to Bed she took this Electuary: Take Electuarium ad
Tabidos, a dram and half: sal Cranii humani, ten grains: Oil of Rosemary, three
drops: mix them to be taken upon a Knives point: having swallowed it down, she
drank after it sometimes a glass of Canary or Hippocras, as she best liked, and
sometimes, a draught of her Diet-drink: if at any time she rested ill, there was
mixed withal a grain or two of our volatile Laudanum; by means of which she
had also gentle breathing sweats.

13. Outwardly, these Topics were applied to the whole Spina Dorsi, and all
the Paralytick parts: Take Powers of Rosemary, of Sassafras, of Savin, of
Nutmegs, of Limons, of each three ounces: Powers of Aniseeds, of sweet Fennel
seeds, and of Caraways of each two ounces and half: Powers of Juniper Berries,
an ounce and half: mix them well together: with this she was well bathed twice
a day, viz. Morning and Evening: And by this method, and the use of these
things according to our order, was this supposed incurable Patient perfectly
made whole in the space of ten months time, after our first undertaking her
Cure. And from hence the poorness and sufficiency of the vulgar shop
Medicaments are more than sufficiently apparent.

XX. A Palsy in a middle-aged Gentleman cured by taking of Opiates.

1. A Gentleman of about four and forty years of age through traveling in the
extremity of cold in the Nightime, was seized with the Palsy, so that being
wholly impotent, he was forced to keep his bed: Several great Doctors were sent
for, who used to him Purging, Vomiting, Bleeding, Frictions, Vesicatories,
Cuppings, Oils, Unguents, Baths, etc. so that scarcely any thing that was usual
was unattempted.

2. In this wretched Condition he lay near ten Months: at length being wearied
with these long, tedious, and uncomfortable Courses of Physic, he resolved to
give over, and commit himself to the good pleasure of God, for that his
Physicians by their very Practice declared him incurable.

3. It was not long before he had given over taking of Physic, but a certain
Emperick came to the place where he lived, who visiting of him, promised to
cure him, if he would commit himself to his care and disposal: The Gentleman
over-joyed at so great promises, resolved to submit, for that he knew, if this
his new Doctor succeeded not, his Disease could be no worse, nor he any more
miserable than he was before.

4. In the first place he well cleansed him in a Bath, whereby the Pores of the
skin were somewhat loosned and opened: this done, he was put into his warm bed,
and he gave him two grains of the Laudanum Paracelsi (very exactly made up)
after which a small glass of Cinnamon Water: This, in about three or four hours
time put him into a plentiful Sweat: In the time of sweating he still comforted
him with a dram or two of Cinnamon Water, by which his Spirits were much
refreshed.

5. He gave him this Laudanum every day, and every fourth day increased the
Dose a grain, till it came to be ten grains; causing him to be well sweated
every Night; and as before upon any faintness, caused him to drink a little
Cinnamon Water to refresh his Spirits, and comfort his Heart.

6. The next Morning after the Sweat was over, he caused all the palsied Parts,
as also the whole Backbone to be well anointed with Oil of Spike; and the same
was also done at Night going to bed, save that before the anointing the Parts
were very well rubbed with a course Cloth.

7. In the daytime he caused him to take (three, four, or five times a day) a
strong Tincture of Castoreum in a glass of Canary: and sometimes he took it in
Cinnamon Water: and whereas he was very subject to be griped, he caused him
often times to take with the same, some drops of the Tincture of Pepper: By the
use of these things only, the Patient was restored to perfect health, after the
using of all the aforenamed things in vain: But the Person that did the Cure,
wholly imputed it to the Virtue of the Laudanum, and his powerful sweating
thereupon for so long time, viz. for near eight weeks space, in which the Cure
was perfected beyond all expectation.

8. By this very Method this Person assured me that he had cured many who had
been paralytick, and had labored under their disaffections for some years; and
that he seldom or never failed of Cure, if the Patient would be constant and
regular, and follow in all things his Directions, as is above prescribed: and I
knew another Person, a Woman of about thirty years of age, whom he cured by the
Method abovesaid, and made her completely well in about six weeks time, which
still adds to the Credit of this opiatick Cure.

XXI. Counsel and Advise sent in a Letter to a paralytick Patient.

1. Madam, I conceive your Disease to be of very difficult cure, considering
you have lain under this indisposition two years and five Months, as you
relate, and have taken the Advice of so great and learned Men as you give an
account of, wherein scarcely any thing has been wanting to you, which they have
not attempted, and yet notwithstanding all these things which have been done,
your Disease has continually got ground upon you.

2. You write that you have a great Contraction in both your Hands, so as that
you can neither extend your Fingers, nor suffer them to be extended by others:
Truly this may be caused from the very great resolution of the opposite Nerves,
which not being sufficiently able to cause extention, nor keep the Parts so,
when extended; suffered them to stand continually bent, from which habitual
position for a long season, the Nerves and Tendons whose proper office it was
to draw the Fingers in, by degrees became contracted.

3. The Weakness and Indisposition of your Stomach; and want of Appetite may
proceed from a coldness of the Stomach, and it is possible there may be a
Paralysis of the Stomach also. The reason why I fear an exceeding coldness of
that Part, is, because of the Benefit you apparently receive from hot things,
and extraordinary Cordials which corroborate the Heart and Vitals, which give
you immediate Releif not only in faintings and sicknesses at Heart, but also
cause you to eat your Food with a much better Appetite, and to digest it also
better.

4. You also signify that you are now and then taken with Fits of the Mother,
which seize you with that Violence that the Bystanders never expect your
coming out of them again. Truly, Madam, I conceive those Fits to be purely
Convulsions of the Mesentery, which are excited from some certain sharp matter,
pricking the intricate mesenterical Plexures of Nerves, which being everywhere
distributed into infinite capilary Ramifications, cannot but be hurt if any
hetrogene or noxious matter interpose: and according as those Plexures of
Nerves and their Ramifications are prejudiced either in whole or in part, so
are the excited mesenterick Convulsions either greater or lesser: Therefore
from the vehemence and long continuance of your Fits, we cannot but conclude,
all the mesen^erick Nerves vastly suffer in that agitation.

5. In the midst of all these Griefs you complain also of a great Pain and
Weakness of your Back and Reins; and that you have sometimes a great stoppage
of your Water, at which time you always make it by drops, with much difficulty
and pain: This Grief your Physicians (you say) have assured you is the Stone in
the Reins. It may be that indeed, Madam, for all that I know, yet you have not
related those Pathognomick Symptoms, which should make us to determine: for
Sand or Gravel, or a slimy and viscous matter obstructed in the Reins may
sufficiently cause Pain and Weakness, where nothing of a Stone is: and I have
known the like in one Person, where there was only a weakness of the Part, and
of the expulsive Faculty, which lasted upon him three Months, and at last
became well, without voiding either Stone, Sand, Matter, or Slime, and has
remained in health now these twelve years, without the least Symptom of that
kind: Yet the Physicians that attended him, all concluded it to be the Stone in
the Reins; which how much they were mistaken, I think the Event has now
sufficiently demonstrated.

6. You seem to be much averse to all manner of Cuppings, Vesications,
Fontanels, Bathings, etc. for that you say, They have been often used to you
without the least Success; rather that you have always been worse after the use
of them; which is a kind of Paradox, if the morbifick matter of your Disease be
a cold and moist humor, as your Physicians all of them have believed it to be:
If this be true, it is much to be feared that there is a light congelation of
the neurotick juice, from whence it comes to pass, that when Cups, or
Vesicatories are applied, they rather draw the common Ros or Gluten, than the
offending matter, so that the thinner Parts being continually drawn away, the
thicker, upon which also there is a slight congelation remain behind, whereby
the Disease becomes more stubborn than it was before: In this case such things
ought to be given of a subtle, volatile, and penetrative Quality which may
thoroughly warm the whole Genus Nervosum, and take off, or resolve the
congelation.

7. You say, That you fear that you are exceedingly over run with the Scurvy,
and that you were very much troubled with it before you was seized with the
Palsy, which your Physicians conjectured from those many and various colored
Spots which oftentimes appeared almost all over your Stomach, Arms, Legs, and
other Parts, running and wandering Pains which you had both in your Bowels and
all your extreme Parts, weakness of Stomach and indigestion, universal
weariness which you had over your whole Body, as if you had been exceedingly
tyred-out with hard Labor or Working, to which Symptoms also was added a
thinness and wasting of your Gums, and looseness of your Teeth.

8. These are truly Symptoms of the Scurvy, so that it may be rationally
conjectured that your Distemper is not simply a Palsy, but a Palsy in a cold
scorbutic habit of Body; and from what has been discoursed of before, we may
safely conclude, that there is a complication of Diseases, the particulars of
which, ought to be seriously considered, before it can be possible to fix upon
a right Method of Cure.

9. One thing more you signify in your Letter, That you are much afflicted with
Wind in your Stomach and Bowels, and when you eat, though it be a very small
matter, you are for the most part swelled after it, as though you were ready to
burst. This is caused, as I apprehend, through the evil disposition of the
Stomach and other Bowels, and the evil Ferment which is contained in them,
which must be taken away or altered, before the affliction after eating can be
wholly remedied: now the reason of your Stomach being thus swelled is from the
Nature and Quality of the fermenting matter: as you see in Wort and New-Ale, as
also in Bottle-drink, upon the exciting of the fermentation, the fermenting
Liquor takes up a larger space of place, and therefore must have more room.

10. The prescription of cure Madam, must follow the complications of your
Disease; and as it plainly enough appears to be a Paralysis in a Scorbutic
habit of Body, so the Medicaments designed for your Cure ought to be
Antiparalyticks joined with Antiscorbuticks, to which ought also to be added
proper Stomaticks (though Antiscorbuticks are so esteemed by many) and such
other Medicaments as may have some respect to the obstruction of the Reins and
your Mesenterick fits: and these things we shall advise in a two fold respect,
viz. Internal and External.

11. The chief Antiscorbuticks taken from vegetables (I mean such as may be
agreeable to your constitution, or fit your habit of Body) are Scurvy Grass,
Mustard Seed, Horseradish, Onions, Garlic, Hydropiper, winters Cinnamon: The
chief mineral Antiscorbuticks, are Antimony, Vitriol, Sulphur, Niter, and Salt:
The chief Animal Antiscorbuticks, are Lizards, Millepedes, Earthworms, Snails,
River or Sea Crabs, Lobsters, Oysters, etc.

12, The chief Antiparalyticks among vegetables, are Rosemary, Sage, Rue,
Lavender, Marjoram, Indian Spicknard, Time Angelica, Saffron, Guajacum,
Cowslips, Orange and Limon-peels, Peony, Misleto, etc. The chief Antiparalytick
among Minerals, are Antimony, Gold, Silver, Quick-line, Amber, etc: The chief
Anteparalyticks among Animal Medicaments, are Vipers, Man's skull, Man's Blood,
Hartshorn, Deers Blood, Elks hoof, Sal Armoniack, Castoreum, etc.

13. Among proper Stomaticks, Virginian Snake-root is accounted the chief, and
by many a most admirable Antiscorbutick, and no doubt but it is a famous
Antidote in that case, as at some other time, I may more plainly demonstrate:
to this you may add Pepper, all the three sorts, Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace,
Cinnamon, Ginger, Carpobalsam, Zedoary, Cardamoms, Grains of Paradise, etc. all
which expel wind also.

14. Among such things as open obstructions of the Reins these are chief:
Niter, Salt of Tartar, Millepedes, Juniper Berries, winter Cherries,
Turpentine, Liquid Storax, Balsam of Peru, Rhenish Wine, Spirit of Wine,
Mustard Seed, Horse-Radish-root, Caraways, Onions, Garlic, Hydropiper, etc.

15. The chief Antihystericks or rather Antispasmaticks are Castoreum, Elks
hoof, Vipers, Musk, Ambergrise, Hartshorn, Man's skull and Blood, Amber, Tin,
Peony, Misleto of the Oak, Opium, etc. This latter paradventure some may object
against as a thing of no approved use, but of very dangerous consequence; but
experience (against which there is no Augment) has given us a sufficient proof
to the contrary.

16. Out of these enumerated simples it is that I intend the prescriptions of
Cure, the which, although I dare not warrant, nor for good reasons much hope
for; yet I doubt not, but if your Ladyship shall be pleased to follow exactly,
you will find some signal advantage thereby, which may encourage you to the
farther use of the same.

17. For your ordinary Drink, I prescribe you a a Guajacum Diet made not too
strong; into all of which (as you drink it) put a small quantity of Spirit of
Sal Armoniack, or Spirit of Onions, Scurvy Grass, Horse Radish, or
Mustard Seed; The said Diet you may make Thus: Take Guajacum rasped, Sassafras
rasped, Sarsaparilla bruised, of each a pound: Liquorice bruised, half a pound:
boil all in twenty quars of water to ten quarts: then add Caraways, three
ounces: Coriander-seeds, two ounces: Fennel-seeds, one ounce: Raisons stoned, a
pound: boil again half an hour, then strain and cool sweeten to your liking
with white Sugar, then bottle it up, with a Clove in it, and keep it for your
ordinary drinking: but at meals I permit you to drink a glass or two Hippocras,
if you shall so please: and this order of Diet, my advise is you should
continue constant to, during the time of your Cure.

18. For your Food, it is not very material what you eat, provided you have a
constant change of Diet, for once or twice eating of a thing cannot prejudice
you, though evil, because it begets no habit, and varieties please the
Appetite: and therefore rather chose to please your Stomach, than to be tied to
any certain Diet, though never so advantageous, least you hurt your Stomach
thereby.

19. Every Morning fasting take this following mixture: Take Tincture of
Antimony, Tincture of Salt of Tartar, Spirit of Horse-radish-roots, of each one
dram: Powers of Rosemary, Sage, Rue, and Lavender, of each half a dram: Spirit
of Vipers, two scruples: choice Hippocras, four ounces: or Cinnamon Water, two
ounces: mix them for a draught: after the taking of which fast an hour or
better.

20. About an hour before Dinner you may take this mixture: Take Tincture of
Virginian Snake-root, Tincture of Cloves, Powers of Cinnamon, of each a dram:
Tincture of Castoreum, two drams: volatile Salt of Millepedes, fifteen grains:
choice Hippocras, three or four ounces: mix them for a draught, to be taken as
aforesaid: after the same you may if you so please, drink, the infusions of
Onions two or three ounces made thus: Take Onions cut and bruised, six ounces:
white Wine, Hydropiper water, of each a pint, or somewhat more: infuse all in a
vessel close covered for forty eight hours: then drink of the clear liquor, as
is before advised.

21. Having dined, you may take a glass of Hippocras, which will help to digest
your Food; and if you so please, you may drop into it about sixty or eighty
drops of the Powers of Cinnamon, which mightily corroborate the Stomach: or in
place thereof, forty drops of the Powers of Caraways, or Tincture of black
Pepper.

22. About four in the Afternoon, take this following Mixture: Take Powers of
Rosemary, and of Sassafras, of each sixty drops: Powers of Vipers, twenty or
five and twenty drops: choice Canary, two or three ounces: mix them for a
Draught. Or this: Take Powers of Cinnamon, sixty drops: Powers of Vipers, five
and twenty drops: strong Tincture of Castoreum, a dram: mix all with Hippocras,
two or three ounces for a Draught. Or this: Take Tincture of Virginian snake
root, Powers of Juniper berries, of each a dram: Tincture of Castoreum, half a
dram: Powers of Vipers, twenty drops: mix them together and give them in a
glass of Canary. Or this: Take Tinctures of Antimony, and of
Virginian-snake-root, of each one dram: Spirit of Scurvy Grass, four scruples:
Salt of Vipers, ten grains: mix and give it in a small glass of Hippocras: or
if you like it better, in a glass of Juniper-Water.

23. At Night going to bed, you may take this Bolus: Take Extracts of Virginian
snake-root, of Saffron, of Castoreum, of Zedoary, and of Cloves, of each a
scruple: Salt of Millepedes, of Hearts horn, and of Mans-skull, of each six
grains: Oils of Rosemary, of Lavender, of Juniper Berries, of each three drops:
mix and make a Bolus for two Doses. Or you may make this Electuary: Take
Extracts of Gentian, of Zedoary, of Saffron, of Virginian-snake-root, of
Castoreum, of Cloves, of each one ounce: Viper-Pouder, four ounces: Tincture of
Antimony, three ounces: the Balsam of Peru, two ounces: Salts of Scurvy Grass,
of Carduus, of Hartshorn, of Mans-skull, of Amber, of Sal Armoniack volatile,
of each two drams: mix all well together, and keep them a while till the
Fermentation is absolved: then add Oils of Rosemary, of Rue, of Sage, of
Lavender, of Cinnamon, of Cloves, of each a dram and half: Musk in fine Powder,
two ounces and a half: Juice of Alkermes enough to make it into a body of a
good consistency. Dose from a dram to two drams, as your strength will bear it,
at bedtime, drinking after it a little glass of Hippocras:

24. If by all that has been hitherto directed, you find that the Pain in your
Reins, and stoppage of Urine do not go off; you must between whiles in the
daytime take some of these following things. Balsam of Peru is commended being
swallowed from a dram to two or three drams: Or you may drink the distilled
Water of Hydropiper, which has a singular Effect for that purpose; or the
distilled Water from Onions or Garlic: These you may drink from a quarter to
half a pint. Some commend a distilled Water from Horse-radish-root,
Scurvy Grass or Mustard Seed: However the Infusion of these things in White or
Rhenish-Wine, as also the Infusion of Onions or Garlic, are of a most singular
account. Millepedes washed in Wine, then dried and poudred, and given to a
scruple, or more, are of good use: so also the Powder of Winter-Cherries, give
to a scruple at a time in White or Rhenish Wine, or in the Infusion of Onions,
or Water of the biting Arsmart.

25. If these things prevail not, you must come to stronger Remedies, such are
the Powers of Juniper berries, which you may take to sixty, eighty or an
hundred drops in a glass of Rhenish-Wine and Sugar; Salt of Egg-shells, made by
a strong Calcination for ten days in a Potters Furnace, and then dissolved in
Spirit of Salt, etc. which may be given in any convenient Vehicle from ten
grains to a scruple, or more, according as you can endure the appertive and
cleansing Quality. To these things add the volatile Spirits of Salt, of
Sulphur, of Vitriol, and of Niter, dulcified and made volatile with the best
rectified Spirit of Wine, as I have formerly directed you: these things you may
take in white or Rhenish Wine, or in Infusion of Onions, or Hydropiper-Water.

26. If also notwithstanding all that has been directed, those Mesenterick
Convulsions, (which you commonly call Fits of the Mother) shall yet molest you,
there is no other Remedy but to betake your-self to the use of Opiates, which
you must take warily and with caution. There is nothing better of that kind
that I know of, than our Laudanum volatile; which you may take at Night going
to bed, beginning with two grains, and so increasing the Dose a grain once a
week: but your best way of taking of it will be by making it soft with two or
three drops of Wine, and then mixing it with the Dose of the Electuary at 23.
above: by which means I doubt not but you will find an extraordinary Effect.

27. These things Madam, you must continue the use of for a long time, and not
be weary of taking them; for as your Disease is complicated, and radicated even
in the Mass of Blood, and nervous Juice, in a Body habituated with the
Scorbute; so it will be necessary to habituate your Body for a long time with
the taking of these Medicaments, that the former habits may be over-powred and
destroyed, for otherwise, whatever we do will be done in vain.

28. Hitherto I have only given you directions as to Internals: I shall now
advise a word or two concerning the most fit and profitable Topics, and so
conclude. First therefore, as to the Contractions in your Hands, my Advise is,
that you first bath them with the Powers of Aniseeds: then anoint them with
this following Liniment. Take Palm-Oyl, (that which is pure sweet, and good,)
six ounces: chemical Oil of Aniseeds, three or four ounces: mix them well
together for a Liniment: anoint with this Morning and Evening, it is probable
it may reduce the contracted Parts, because it is known by many experiences
that Aniseeds, and especially their chemical Oil, have a specific V rtue in
comforting and restoring the Nerves: I order it to be mixed with an unctious
Body, such as Palm Oil, because contracted Nerves have a great need of such
things as have a suppling and humecting Property.

29. And because of that Pain which you often feel in your Bowels, which you
take to be Wind, but more especially because of those Mesenterick Convulsions,
I advise that twice a day, the whole Regi^n of the Abdomen, from the Macronata
to the Os Pubis downwards, and laterally to the Hypochonders be well bathed
with Powers of Aniseeds, or of sweet Fennel seeds, or with Powers of Savin,
which have a specific Virtue against those kind of Fits: for want of these you
may use the Powers of Amber, which in some Persons have succeeded well.

30. All the Paralytick Members, as also the Spina Dorsi you may bath with this
following Mixture: Take Powers of Aniseeds, of Amber, of Rosemary, of
Juniper Berries, of Lavender, and of Savin, of each three ounces. Powers of
Oranges, of Limons, of Sassafras, and of Nutmegs, of each an ounce and half:
mix them together to bath withal Morning and Evening. Or you may bath with
this Mixture: Take Powers of Rue, and of Rosemary, of each four ounces: Powers
of Amber, three ounces: Powers of sweet Fennel-seeds, two ounces: mix them to
bath withal, as aforesaid. Or you may use this Oil: Take Oil of Ben, ten
ounces: chemical Oils of Juniper Berries, of Caraways, of Aniseeds, of each two
ounces: Oil of Savin, one ounce: mix them together to anoint withal, during
the time of the Cure.

31. Lastly, I advise you, Madam, that you limit the Doses of each Medicament,
not exactly to the Proportions which I have assigned, but as you find your
strength, constitution, and Stomach will bear, for that is the Index by which
you must be directed through this whole Course, and we must be careful to keep
that right upon the Wheels; for if that prevaricates we can expect no good
Success in the rest of our Undertakings: If you find a nautiousness, you may
drop of this following Mixture in any Liquor which you drink, so much as may
give it a grateful acidity: Take pure Oil of Vitriol, one ounce: Oil of Cloves,
one dram: Cinnamon Water, four ounces: mix them together by degrees: Dose
thirty or forty drops at a time in any convenient Vehicle. Use it as you see
convenient. Add this, that once in seven, eight or ten days, you purge off
gently the morbifick matter, (being then fit for excretion,) with a strong
Tincture of Sena and choice Rhubarb made in Cinnamon Water, repeating the same
at the limited times through the whole course of the Cure.

Observations from other Authors.
XXII. A most excellent Ointment against the Palsy.

1. A most Illustrious noble Man, being frequently accustomed to swim, coming
out of the water after swiming, toward the Evening he felt his Body to be
convulsed, and a while after he found himself deprived of all motion in his
Hands and Feet.

2. Being brought home, he calls Physicians to advise, who constantly averr
that the coldness of the water had cast him into a Palsy, and they had reason
so to Judge; For the cause foregoing did argue that it was so, For cold water
weakens the Brain, thickens the Spirits, renders them slow to motion, straitens
the Channels and the passages whereby the Spirits flow into the sensitive parts,
and many times extinguishes the inbred fire of the Nerves; as Heurnius a
learned Master of our Art relates, lib. 5. Aphorism. Com. 17. happened to a
notable swimmer in the River of Seine at Paris, who having twice swam over the
said River, the third time as he was crossing the same, he perished in the
midst of the Chanel.

3. The Physicians having in the first place appointed an exquisite Diet for
the person aforesaid, they prescribed for him sundry purgations, such as might
both strenghen and withal draw out the cold humor.

4. They apply fomentations to the Marrow of the Back and also to the palsied
parts: Likewise they apply Ointments made of hot Gums, Spices and Oils. But all
these things doing no good at all, he made trial of natural Baths: Bu^ when
these and sweating drinks made of Ebony would do no good, the Disease was given
over by Physicians as incurable.

5. Being sent for, I provided a remedy for so great a malady, by the help
whereof I have healed many (by Gods blessing) that were troubled with an
universal and particular Palsy: this being applied a month together, he was
freed from his Palsy and restored to his perfect health. The said Medicament
is thus made.

6. Take Sage, sweet-Marjoram, Bays, Betony, Rosemary, Origanum, Calamint,
Staechas, Marjoram, wild Time, of each half a handful: roots of Acorus, new
Orris, of each an ounce and half: Bay Berries, Pellitory of Spain, Cubebs,
Nutmegs, the three Peppers, of each half a dram: flesh of Squills, an ounce:
roots of wild Cucumbers, two drams: Groundpine, Germander, of each a pugil:
live Sulphur powdered, half an ounce: Oil of Castoreum, half a pound: Oil of
Bays, of Rue, of each two ounces: Aqua vitae, half a pint: Orange flower-water,
three ounces: the strongest-Wine, a quart: boil all these till the Wine is
consumed, to the strained liquor add Sagapenum, Opopanax, Bdellium, of each two
drams: Castoreum, two drams: Mace, Nutmegs, Storax, Cloves, Lignum Aloes, of
each two drams: long Pepper, half a dram: Balsam, two ounces: Oil of Liquid
Amber, one ounce: Vnguentum Martiatum, Aregon, Agrippae, of each an ounce: Oil
of Tiles, of Turpentine, of each two ounces: Oil of Mace, of lignum Guajacum,
of each one ounce: Oil of the Pepers, of Rosemary, of Anise, of Salt, Angelica,
of Sulphur, of Thyme, of each an ounce: Oil of Euphorbium, an ounce and half:
grease of a wild Cat, Goose grease, of each two ounces: Badgers grease three
drams: Vipers grease, a dram: Oil of Foxes, an ounce: Marrow of a Cows leg, two
drams: juice of Dwarf-Elder, Sage, Bawm, of each two ounces: mix all and with a
sufficient quantity of Wax melted in the foresaid Oils; reduce them to the form
of an Ointment, of a middle consistency, Zacutus Lusitanus, lib. 1. Observe. 34.

XXIII. A Palsy after Childbirth.

1. Though the Palsy be a Disease bred of cold and clammy Juice, yet it
sometimes arises from an humor somewhat hot; in which case all Physicians grant
Blood-letting to be necessary.

2. But if the Palsy arise after Childbirth, the menstrual Blood being
suppressed, out of what Part Blood is to be drawn, those that write of Women's
Diseases do not determine; although it is a doubtful Question and full of
difficulties.

3. I remember that I have seen Women that have had a real Palsy in their Legs,
when after Child birth their Courses have not flowed in such a measure as might
answer to the fullness of their Blood.

4. These Women being taken with a burning Fever, the Physicians tormented
with Purgations and local Remedies applied to the Parts affected, and exceeding
hot Baths, being extremely afraid to let any blood.

5. For, if Blood be taken from the Arm, it suppresses their Courses, if from
their Feet, the Blood will be drawn to the Parts affected, and the humors
rushing violently down, they make the Disease worse.

6. But because this Disease took its original from a vapourous matter,
transmitted from the Womb to the original of the Nerves, breeding in them an
obstruction, stopping the way, by which the animal Spirits descend, and
hindering the sense and motion of the lower Parts, and she had not been duly
purged after her Childbirth; and the Fever hence arising was urgent, and the
Woman being ruddy, of a musculous and well compacted Body, and having broad
Veins full of Blood, I boldly took a good quantity of Blood from her right
Ankle; after which Evacuation, the cause of the obstruction being taken away,
she began to move her Feet; and so being let blood again in her other Foot, her
Legs recovered their sense and motion. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib. 1. Observe. 35.

XXIV. A Palsy in a Man of seventy years of age.

1. A certain lusty and strong Soldier, being in the seventieth year of his
age, having in the Eastern Countries served forty years in the Wars; and
consequently being much wasted and broken with hard marching and labor, worn
out with watchings and stricken in years, he seemed of a thin Body and spare of
Flesh; yet his Body was musculous, his Color fresh, his Veins large and full
of Blood, and as himself related he had during his past Life been troubled with
few Diseases, and those gentle, which commonly were terminated and cured with
bleeding at the Nose; to which he was subject at the approach of the Spring:
all which proceeded from the abundance of Blood, as his hot and moist
Complexion declared.

2. This Man was taken with a Palsy on his left Side, which arose as it appears
from what had been said, from the plenty of Blood obstructing, and the moisture
thereof slackning his Nerves: for he had a deep Redness in his Face, and he
voided red Spittle mixed with snotty Phlegm, and that without any Cough or
straining.

3. Being called to him, although in regard of his age, the Disease seemed
incurable, or at least it would continue long, yet I entered upon the Cure in
this manner; having in the first place injected an emollient Clyster, I drew
Blood from the Basilica Vein of his right Arm.

4. And a great Company of Remedies being prepared to attenuate, Heat, and
strengthen; visiting him in the Evening, he told me, he found some sense in his
palsied Arm and Leg.

5. I growing bolder, though he was in years, opened a Vein again on the
following day, and putrifyed Blood being voided, he said, he had his Feeling
perfectly in his Arm: For which cause, since he was better and his bodily
Forces were more vigorous, the Burden being taken off, and the Passages being
opened, being let blood again the next day, he began to stir his palsied
Members.

6. And lastly, after the fourth blood-letting, without any external Medicament
applied to the Parts, by the motion of his Arm and Leg it appeared that he was
perfectly cured. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib. 1. Observe. 36.

XXV. A Palsy of the Eyelids.

1. A certain Person traveling in the depth of Winter through the Snow, fell
into a Palsy of his Eye lids; for they lost their sense, insomuch that he could
not move either his upper or lower Eyelids; for they stuck so closs together,
that they could not be parted but with an Instrument, or with a Man's Nails, for
him to see.

2. This Man after general Remedies respecting his whole Body and Head; and
diverse particular Applications, was chiefly helped by an Ointment made of
Balsam mixed with Aqua Vitae. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib. 1. Observe. 59.

XXVI. A Palsy of the Tongue cured by opening the Veins under the Tongue.

1. The Flesh of the Tongue is soft, rare, lax like a Sponge, which is covered
with a very thin Membrane, common to the Mouth and Palate, into which the Nerves
of the third and fourth conjugation are disseminated.

2. These being palsied, and the fault being communicated from the Brain, viz.
the way being intercepted and stopped by thick Blood, and the free Passage both
of the moving and sensitive Faculty being hindered, a certain young Man fell
into a Palsy of the whole Tongue; for it wholly lost both Taste, Motion and
Speech.

3. This Man tried many Remedies, which are wont to be contrived for an
universal Palsy. These things being done, he had an Issue made in the Nape of
his Neck, and drank a Decoction of Ebony many days together.

4. He took many times corroborating Medicaments, Apozems, Tablets, Opiats: to
the hinder Part of his Neck, and behind his Ears he applied diverse Ointments,
these things profited nothing.

5. But he being plethorick and strong, and his Cheeks being red, I caused him
to bleed twice in the Veins under the Tongue, encouraged thereto by the
Authority of Avicenna, 6. 3. Tract. 1. Cap. 7.

6. And if it be conceived that Blood and Moisture are predominant in the Body,
let the Veins of his Tongue be opened, and apply Cupping-Glasses to his Chin,
etc.

7. This being practiced, the Patient grew better, for the Part being
refreshed, ventilated and assisted by the help of those Medicaments wherewith
the Tongue was washed, t dissolves and dissipates the subject humor, and the
Patient recovered Sense, Motion, and Speech. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib. 1. Observe.
76.

XXVII. A Palsy of the Gullet coming upon a burning Fever, is cured by
drinking of Wine.

1. Dioscorides the admirable Interpreter of the nature of all things, Lib. 5.
Cap. 6. post Princip. does most plainly aver, That Wine is the most safe
Antidote against all Poisons in the World; they, to wit, Wines, says he are
good against Venoms which kill by Exulcerations.

2. A certain strong Woman fell into a contagious spotted Fever, having her
Tongue black, burned, and like Soot in Color, continually crying out for
Drink, and intolerable hot, this Woman on the eleventh day becoming dumb, was
taken with a difficulty in her swallowing, so that she could eat neither solid
nor liquid things.

3. The ancient Physicians have told us, That this Disease proceeds from an
adust and fiery heat in burning Fevers, by reason of the dryness of the
external Coat and the transverss Fibers, wherewith the Gullet or Pharynx is
interwoven; for which cause, they, by reason of their dryness, cannot purge
themselves, so as is requisite in the swallowing of Meat and Drink.

4. The Original of this Disease being discerned, we provide Lotions and
Ointments for her Fauces and Neck, which being applied externally and
internally, might moisten the Part; and amongst the chief, we used a Bath of
Goats-Milk with Oil of Roses, and we did all other things, which are fit to
bridle the Acrimony of Choler, and to help an inward Inflammation.

5. After which things she being worse, and without Pulse, lay speechless, as
it were and ready to die the same hour, with a ghastly Countenance; she used no
Food for the space of ten days, nor had any Benefit from nourishing Clysters,
which if peradventure they were at any time injected, presently she let them go
again, her vital Spirit being almost consumed, with an exceeding hot Fever,
did at length cool, to use the words of Galen, Lib. 6. Epidem. Sect. 4. Com.
29. destitude of all help, she lay like a dead Carcass, tumbled down to the
feet of the Bed, her extreme Parts being cold, her Pulse very weak, her Lips
blew, as if she had been breathing her last.

6. What to do to her in this Agony, I was quite to seek: I gave her strong
Wine to drink, she refused it; I caused it to be squirted into her Mouth with a
Syringe, whereby it came to pass that some drops went into her Stomach against
her Will.

7. With this small quantity of Drink, which exceeded not half an ounce in a
day, or at least with the fragancy and odor of the Wine, being recreated, she
began to open her Eyes and to know the Bystanders.

8. Being made more cheerful, I gave her more of the said Wine to drink;
conveighing the same into her Mouth by a Silver-Pipe: from this small quantity
of Wine, by little and little in eight days space, we rose to a very great
quantity, so that every day she drank a pint or more, whereas she had not been
accustomed to drink Wine before.

9. She now becoming stronger, would chew a bit of Bread dipped in Wine, at
which time she began to pronounce all her words plainly, being now more smooth,
comely and fatter than before; in stead of Water, she was content only to drink
Wine, which she drank in abundance without measure, by the Force and Efficacy
whereof, her Stomach being strengthened, which through the malice of the Venom,
was as it were mortifyed; Galen, Lib. 6. Aporism. 3. the Fibers of her Gullet
being strengthened, the destructive and deadly quality of the humor being
vanquished and overcome, which had impaired the Organs of swallowing, and all
the Bowels in a manner; it came to pass that she whom all the Diligence of the
Attendants, nor the accurate Care of Physicians, nor any kind of Medicaments
could help, so that she lay for dead, without Speech, without any Pulse,
without Sense, breathing out her Soul amongst her Kindred and Allies, yet by
the help of the merciful God, and of Nature, rousing her self up, and only by
the use of Wine she began to revive.

10. So great is the Force of Wine, such it is Efficacy, in recreating an
exhausted Body, to the drinking whereof wild Creatures and Beasts themselves
are naturally inclined, wherewith delighted, helped, and in extreme weariness
recreated, and that for many causes, which are acurately and most eloquently
cited in the Storehouses of Authors; of Forrainers by Laelius Bistiola, Tom.

XXVIII. A Palsy of the Sphincter-Muscle cured by Ebony.

1. It is elgantly said by Avicen, 1. 4. Tract. 2. Cap. 2. That from killing
acute Fevers the Patients seldom escape without Contraction of a Member.

2. An honest Matron was sick of a most malignant Fever, from which through
the Blessing of the Almighty upon the endeavors of the Physicians, she was
delivered. When she recovered, she felt the Excrements of her Belly came away
against her Will, and she confessed, she could not shut her Fundament, nor
contract the Spincter-Muscle thereof.

3. This Malady did, as I supposed arise from the debility of native Heat,
wasted away by the foregoing Fever, and the abundance of a cold Humor falling
down to the Sphincter: For by means of the foregoing deadly Disease, her forces
were decayed, and her digestion weak; for she had no Color, was lean, and
could scarcely go.

4. Remedies are prescribed; a gentle Purgation, Fomentations, Washings and
Fumigations are applied to her Fundament, the Malady gave way to no Remedies.

5. In conclusion, Sweats being raised with a Decoction of Ebony for twenty
days together, she retained her Excrements a longer space than formerly;
lastly, applying this Plaster to the Os Sacrum, she was perfectly cured.

6. Take Emplastrum Viperinum, Confortativum Vigonis, Gummi Tacamahaca, of each
half an ounce: Oils of Bays, of Angelica, of Castoreum, of Costus, of Aniseed,
of Turpentine, of Rosemary, of Pepper, of each half an ounce: with Wax make a
Plaster according to Art, and spread it upon a Wolfs Skin.

7. I remember that long since I cured by natural Baths a Palsy of the Arse-Gut
in a certain old Man, whose Excrements came away against his Will, which
proceeded from a cruel Epilepsy: For after that it had miserably tormented him
for a Month together; being attended with most grievous Symptoms, it ended in a
Palsy of his Arm and Arse-Gut.

8. Nor should you think this strange; for Galen taught the same 4. Acut. 27.
Avicen confirmed 1. 3. Tract. 5. Cap. 8. And as the Apoplexy turns to the
Palsy, so the Epilepsy in many turns to the Palsy, etc. This is confirmed by
Erastus, Lib. 4. Disput. contra Paracelsum; and by Salius ad Cap. 19. Altomar.

9. For the Apoplexy does very frequently turn to the Palsy, because the cause
hereof is much greater, the Obstruction being confirmed and hard to remove, and
the Brain languishing; and therefore it can neither discuss the thick Humor,
nor transmit the same to places ordained for Excretion, and contrary causes do
frequently happen in the Epilepsy.

10. Sometimes, though seldom, if the Epilepsy be grievous and afflicts the
Patient with frequency of Fits, and is near of Kin to the Apoplexy, it ends in
a Palsy, as Costaeus in Com. Avicen learnedly explained the matter.

11. Wherefore frequently the Apoplexy, sometimes the Epilepsy ends in a Palsy:
with this distinction that Contradiction is solved in Galen, who, Vallesius
says, does manifestly contradict himself. Lib. de locis manifest pugnantibus
contradict. 6. Whereas thus he is to be understood in 4. de loc. 2. saying,
That only an Apoplexy turns to a Palsy. See Amasus, 4. Cen. 22. Zacutus
Lusitanus, Lib. 2. Obs. 158.

XXIX. Of the Palsy in Arms and Legs.

1. A certain worthy Gentleman fell into a Palsy of both his Arms, his Hands,
his Fingers, and Feet: to whom being called, I observed that this Disease
sprang from too much Repletion; wherefore I fell upon this following brief
method of Cure.

2. Th first day, I gave him an ounce of my Aqua Benedicta, with as much fair
Water mingled therewith. This Potion made him Vomit much Choleric and
Phlegmatic matter.

3. On the third day, I gave him a dram of Extract of Esula, in four ounces of
Pea's-broth: which being mixed, strained, and pressed out, he drank in the
Morning; and he was orderly purged.

4. On the fifth day, he began by my advice, to use a Decoction of
Sarsaparilla, prepared after this manner: Take Sarsaparilla bruised, one ounce:
infuse it twenty four hours in Water and Wine, of each one pint and half: and
boil, it half away. Of this he took in the Morning, in his bed, seven ounces
hot, and being well covered with Clothes, he did sweat plentifully a long time
together.

5. After this sufficient and very proper Sweating; I opened his Vena Basilica
with great success.

6. His Diet was drying, and moderately heating; after all this he began to
grow well, and to recover the perfect Motion of those parts, which had been
Palsied. Martinus Rulandus; Cent. 1. Cur. 3.

XXX. Of the Palsy in a very aged Man.

1. One John Fux, of the Village of Altepain, being seventy five years old, was
taken with the Palsy; for his right Arm was deprived both of Sense and Motion;
which grievious Disease was accompanied with pain in the Stomach, loathing of
Meat; and difficulty of Breathing.

2. For the Cure of which Symptoms, I began this following Method; first, I
purged his Breast, Stomach, and whole Body with this following Potion: Take of
the Decoction of Sena, three ounces: Benedicta Laxativa, one dram: Extract of
Esula, one scruple: Ginger, ten gra^ns: mix them, this I gave him in the
Morning fasting, which purged him very well, and, he was much the better.

3. His Body being well purged for five days together, he took by my advice the
quantity of a Pease of this following Powder, which caused him to sneez often
and to void much thick and clammy Snevil out of the Ventricles of the Brain;
the Powder was thus made.

4. Take Darnel, Nigella-seeds, white Hellebor-root, of each one scruple:
Marjoram, Rosemary, Sage, of each half a dram: Musk, two grains: make all into
very fine Powder.

5. His Diet was spare, drying, attenuating and moving Urine: his Table-Drink
was Wine, wherein Rosemary had been steeped, also every Morning he drank half
an ounce of Aqua Vitae, wherein Rosemary had been also steeped.

6. The Original likewise of the Nerves and his whole Arm were many times
rubbed with hot Clothes: And so by these few Remedies, fit for an old Man, his
Arm, beyond all expectation within the space of seven days, recovered its sense
and motion, to God only be immortal Praise. Martinus Rulandus, Cent. 2. Cur. 54.

XXXI. Of the Palsy in a Gentlewoman from drinking Water.

1. A certain Gentlewoman, who for the recovery of her Health, took a Journey
for Bristol; for she thought she was afflicted with the Stone, for which she
drank St. Vincents-Well Water too greedily, to the quantity of eighteen pints a
day, so that thereby cooling her Body too much, she fell into a Palsy.

2. She afterward went to the Bath, where being purged, and using the Bath,
she was restored; returning home in rainy tempestuous Weather, that Night she
was assaulted with the Mother, with Fainting and a light Palsy on the left
Side, to whom being called I helped by the following things.

3. Take Aloes lucid, two drams: Agarick trochiscated new made, Rhubarb, of
each one dram: the Barks of Caper roots, Winterian-Cinnamon, Tamarisk, of each
one scruple: the Fecula of the roots of Briony and Aron, of e^ch half a
scruple: Castor, one dram and half: Cream of Tartar, half a dram: Spirit of
Amber, four grains: with Syrup of Fumetory compound, a sufficient quantity:
make Pills number six of one dram. Of which she took three at Night when she
went to bed, which gave her four stools the next day.

4. For the Wind of her Stomach: Take Species Diambrae, one dram: the Oils of
Sage chemical, of Nutmegs, of Cloves, of each four drops: Sugar dissolved in
Rose Water, two ounces: make Rowls to be taken after Meat.

5. For the Palsy: Take Spirit of Rosemary, Oil of Amber, of each an equal
part: with which her Neck was gently anointed.

6. For Fainting: Take Species Plerisarchonticon, half an ounce: fine Sugar,
two ounces: mix them. Dose half a spoonful, this delivered her both from her
fainting and trembling at Heart, with which she had been often troubled; it is
a Powder worth Gold, which I always carry about with me.

7. She used also this Decoction: Take Guajacum, eight ounces: Bark of the
same, Rosemary, Sassafras, Sarsaparilla, of each one ounce: Betony, Sage,
Lavender, Germander, of each one pugil: roots of Elecamparte, Peony, Orrice,
Citron Peels dried, of each one ounce: Spring Water, six pounds: infuse them
for four and twenty hours in a hot place, after boil them in a close Vessel;
then straining, sweeten it with Sugar, and aromatize it with Species Diambrae,
half a dram: She took six ounces of it in the Morning and sweat, and as much at
four a clock in the Afternoon, without sweating.

8. She had Clysters framed of the common Decoction and Carminative-seeds, to
which we added Holland-Pouder, she used also Ciprus-Turpentine framed into
Pills very often, and thus was she delivered from all these, and also the
Danger of Death. Hall, Cent. 2. Obs. 76.

XXXII. Of a Palsy in an aged Man.

1. There was prescribed for the Palsy, in a very aged Man the following
things: Take Oil of Foxes, two ounces: of Amber, two drams: mix them. With it
anoint the whole Spine from the Nape of the Neck to the Coxis, every third day.

2. The resolved Parts, with those near, were anointed with Oil of Castor, one
ounce, and Spirit of Wine, at pleasure.

3. Take candied Ginger, beat it into a soft Electuary with Syrup of
Wood Sorrel. Dose half an ounce every day in the Morning; at other times, often
in a day he took the Antepileptick of Langius, with Crumbs of Bread, and
sometimes Oil of Amber, six or seven drops, with a knob of Sugar.

4. Vesicatories were applied to each Shoulder, and kept open.

5. Take Pil. Aloephanginae, one scruple: Extractum Rudii, half a scruple:
Castoreum, three grains: with Oxymel, make four Pills to be taken twice a week,
or at pleasure.

6. He had sneezing Powder, but seldom used it: Take Aqua Epileptica Langii,
three ounces: Spirit of Castor, one ounce: the Syrup of the Flowers of
Cow-slips and Staechas, one ounce: to be taken at need.

7. Take White-Wine-Vinegar, a pint: Mustard, two spoonfuls: Pepper finely
poudred, a spoonful: Honey, three spoonfuls: make a Gargarism: use six
spoonfuls Morning and Night, three days before the new and full of the Moon.
Hall, Cent. 3. Observe. 23.

XXXIII. A Palsy or Resolution of the lower Parts.

1. A Maid marriagable, returning with her Sister and others to Basil from a
Town hard by; riding behind a Man, by a shot from another, was made Paralytick
in the lower Parts from the middle of the Back, insomuch that she could move
neither Hand nor Foot, but was senseless, and was so brought home.

2. The Chyrurgion found the Wound in the middle of the Back, which he dressed,
supposing it to be a Fall from the Horse, but when he found no Defect above,
and all the lower Parts were loose and stupid, he and the Woman used diverse
means, among others, they used Stuphs for the Feet, from which arose such a hot
Vapor, because she felt no burning by reason of the numness, that her Feet and
Legs were black and burnt all over to the Hips and swollen, as if the skin had
been scalded.

3. I being sent for, asked the first cause, she said, when she heard the
report of a Gun, which was shot off by one that traveled with them, she felt a
Pain at that moment of time, as if her Back had been touched, and suddenly
fainted, and knew not whether she fell or was held by her Friends, till she
came to her self.

4. I looked upon the Wound on the right side of the Back, about the eighth or
ninth Vertebrae, and went into the Marrow of the Bone turning: It was exactly
round in the Skin, and grew deep, no sign of Contusion being about it: I
supposed it to be from the shot, and commanded her Clothes to be brought, which
with her Smock had a round hole; I determined that the Wound was by the Gun
shot, and that the Marrow was hurt.

5. And the Chyrurgions and others were of my Opinion, especially when by the
Probe they found that part of the Vertebrae was broken off.

6. Now ten days were passed since the hurt was first, in which she complained
not before of any hurt in the upper part, and she began to be worse, and to
vomit, and to complain of heat above in her Backbone, Headache, and Cramp
about her Neck.

7. For these we gave Remedies: as for the Wound, prognosticating in the mean
while that it was incurable, as it straight appeared; for the twentieth day
after the Mischance she died.

8. And because some doubted whether it was from a Fall or a Gunshot, though
it was manifest that she fell not from the Horse, but was held by him that rid
before her, after the Gun went off and she fainted, therefore the Bullet must
needs be in her Body, because there was no passage out.

9. Therefore in regard, after opening her Body, we found no Bullet in the
Wound, which went under the Vertebra, we took out part of the Backbone, and
opened right against the place where the Wound was, and found a leaden Bullet
that broke through the spinal Marrow and stuck in the body of the Vertebra; the
Bullet was flat where it touched the Bone, as I have seen in others that
touched the Bone, and had not penetrated it through. Platerus, Obs. Lib. 1.
Page 129.

XXXIV. A Palsy in the Tongue that hindered Speech.

1. An old Merchant after an Apoplectick Fit, remained Paralytick upon one
Side; and had the Palsy in his Tongue; he was cured after a sort, and could
walk again, the Palsy still remaining in his Tongue: he could not speak that you
might understand him, and now his Disease was old.

2. I being requested to help him, because I would purge him before I used
Topics, I gave these Pills: Take Pil. Cochiae, and Fetidae, of each a scruple:
with Honey of Squills make Pills.

3. Afterward I advised him to use these following three or four times in a
Month: Take Agarick-Troches, two drams: gummy Turbith infused in Hydromel, half
a dram: Myrrh, Sarcocol infused in juice of Roses, of each two scruples:
Castor, a scruple and half: Mastick, Sal-Gem, of each a scruple: Aloes, half an
ounce: with Honey of Squills make a Mass.

4. Let him often in the Morning chew this: Take Cubebs, Nutmegs, Mustard seed,
of each a dram: Cloves, Galangal, long Pepper, of each half a dram: Salt an
ounce: with Wax make a Masticatory. Then let him wash his Mouth with salt water
of pickled Olives.

5. And he anointed his Nostrils with this Ointment to divert the matter: Take
Troches of Alhandal, Diagrydium, of each a dram: white Hellebor, a scruple:
Castor, half a scruple: with Honey of Squills, make an Ointment.

6. Let the hinder part of his Head and Neck shaved be anointed with this: Take
Oil of Pepper, of Euphorbium, of each an ounce and half: with red Wax make a
Liniment.

7. After he had used these for a time, he licked often the Electuary of Honey
of Squills and Rosemary; he washed his Mouth with this and gargled: Take
Nutmegs, an ounce: Galangal, Costus, of each half an ounce: Ginger, two drams:
Mustard seed, three drams: boil them in Wine and Honey to wash the Mouth.

8. He used a good Diet, which I ordered and Baths for sweating, and that he
should endeavor to speak: thus though he could not plainly speak, yet he speak
so that he might be understood. Platerus, Obs. Lib. 1. Page 133.

XXXV. A Palsy in the Tongue that hindered Speech, and in the Fingers.

1. A Preacher in his old age had his Face swollen, with great Bladders full of
yellow matter, he cut them off and they filled again, a little after he found
an Impediment, when he began to speak in his pronunciation, and he moved his
Fingers, and when he laid hold on any thing with his right Hand, as his Pen to
write, it was weak. And on the Thigh on the same side, there was a Bladder full
of yellow matter, as before in his Face.

2. All these Accidents ceased, only his Speech was a little faltering, which
troubled him most, because it was taken notice of when he preached.

3. He desired my Counsel, because he had used little Physic; I prescribed
these light but efficacious Remedies, he drank this Wine made new, because it
was Vintage: Take Ground Pine dried, half an ounce: Sage, Wormwood, of each
two drams: Rosemary-Flowers, Primroses, of each a dram: let them work in the
Wine, he drank often of it.

4. And because he could not swallow Pills, I ordered this Potion to purge him,
it is gentle, least by working strongly, it move the defluction, and cause it
anew, as I have often observed it in the Palsy and Gout: Take Rhubarb, four
scruples: Mechoacan, a dram and half: Sena, two drams: infuse them in the
aforesaid Wine of Ground Pine, strain and add Syrup of Roses solutive, an ounce.

5. He took a Bolus sometimes in the Morning of Ground Pine and Sage boiled in
Honey and preserved; and drank after it a little Rosemary and Thym-Water.

6. And used this Masticatory: Take Cubebs, a dram: long Pepper, half a dram:
Nutmegs, a dram and half: Mastick, a dram: Angelica seed, half a dram:
Mustard Seed, and Water-Cr^sses, of each a scruple: Euphorbium, three g^ains:
with Wax make a Masticatory to chew.

7. He washed his Mouth often with Rosemary-Wine distilled, and rubbed his
Tongue with Mustard, and washed it with Wine. Platerus, Observe. Lib. 1. Page
135.

XXXVI. A Palsy and Convulsion.

1. An eminent Physician of Frontinia was afflicted the foregoing Autumn with a
very long lasting and double Tertian, which continued to the beginning of
Winter, he was of a melancholy Complexion, being forty years old, he had fed in
Lent upon bad Diet: also had been troubled with grievous Passions of Mind.

2. After Easter he began to be troubled with a Catarrh falling upon his left
Shoulder Blade, where he felt Pain; a few days after he fell into a painful
imminution of Motion and Sense in all Parts almost, but especially in his Legs
and Thighs.

3. Moreover painful stretchings happened by Fits in the said Parts; so that
the Toes of his Feet were contracted, and the Muscles near his Groins were
streched like Cords.

4. In his upper Parts, especially his Arms, he could stir himself more freely:
but in all Parts, his Sense was obtuse and dull, so that he affirmed, he had
little or no Feeling in his Nose and Face.

5. He voided at his Mouth a thin humor, which he said tasted sharp and harsh
like Vitriol; every day his Fever was exasperated, and during the
exacerbation, the tension of his Muscles, his Fluxion, and other Symptoms were
increased; also his Breast was very much straightened, so that he seemed to be
stifled.

6. At the beginning of this Malady, he was twice let blood and twice purged,
and then went to the Balerucan Baths; where he was four times put into the Bath
for four days together, and had his Head washed, to no purpose.

7. Being returned from the Bath, he took my advice; now I judged that this
Disease of his proceeded from a wheyish humor flowing from his Brain into the
Marrow of his Back, and all the body of the Nerves, and that the said wheyish
humor was first gathered in his Hypochondria, especially in the Meseraick
Veins, where a great quantity of melancholy humor was contained, bred of
foregoing causes.

8. So that I conceived this Disease of his was an hypochondriacal affection,
whose Symptoms were that same Palsy and imperfect Convulsion, bred of a wheyish
humor, shed into the aforesaid Parts.

9. An Argument whereof was both the melancholic constitution of the Patient,
as also the flowing of such an humor from his Mouth in great quantity, likewise
the Fever wherewith in a manner he was afflicted continually; and as the
Fever increased, all the Symptoms increased, when as nevertheless a Palsy is
wont to cure a Fever proceeding from Phlegm.

10. Sennertus tells us, That such Symptoms proceed from a melancholy humor,
treating of the Hypochondriacal Disease, and of the Scurvy.

11. This is no Palsy properly, which is caused by the stoppage of the
beginning of the Nerves, but abusively so called, being no total privation of
Sense and Motion, by stopping the influx of the animal Spirits through the
Nerves; but rather a deprivation of the sensitive motive Function, because
there is a painful Sense.

12. I prescribed him an Apozem for many days together of temperate Aperitives,
purging him one day and altering another, and applying an emollient and opening
Fomentation to his Hypochondria, a Liniment of the same faculty; also
blood-letting after the first Dose of the Apozem, a Clyster being premised and
a purging Medicament.

13. He used for his Drink the infusion of Tamarisk-Bark, Agrimony and Burnet.

14. But the Blood which came from him, appearing very full of bad Juice, he
was let blood again. He found no good by his other Medicaments, but seemed to
grow worse.

15. When I visited him again, being on the 24th of April, I found him very
weak with a continual slow Fever, which had nevertheless Paroxysms of a
tertian Ague: In which his Hypochondria were puffed up with wind by Fits,
especially his Spleen. Sometimes also by reason of the said Wind, his Midriff
was so compressed, that he would cry out, he was choked and stifled, and
having drunk a Cup of Water, he belched twice or thice, and was presently freed
from the said Suffocation.

16. A fatty substance did swim upon his Urine like Cobwebs, and their
sediments were of a mealy substance, which kind of Urines are deadly, according
to Hyppocrates in the second of this Prognostics.

17. On his well day he did spit exceedingly, and felt the humor trickle down
between his Skull and Skin, or the Muscles of his Face. On the 29th of the same
Month I visited him again, being at the last cast, his Pulse very small, his
spitting staid and his Breath stopped, yet his Understanding was not hurt: he
dyed the next day following in the Morning. Riverius, Cent. 1. Observe. 74.

XXXVII. A Bastard-Palsy.

1. A virtuous Woman of Aix, about fifty years old, having suffered Abortion,
was at first troubled with a nummedness about her Belly, which she easily
perceived; by putting her Hand upon her Belly.

2. After the Abortion some Months, she proved with Child, and during the
Course of her Impregnation, the said nummedness seized also upon her Thighs and
Legs, and a far worse Symptom was added thereto. viz, an inability to stir them.

3. After she was brought to bed, many purging and sweating Medicines were
used, and many other heating and drying Remedies, without any Effect, so that
she had been now two years troubled with this grievous Infirmity in the Part
aforesaid; the Sense of Feeling was not quite taken away, but only impaired,
but all motion was quite lost.

4. Yet there is one thing peculiar and well worth the observation; that when
her Leg were drawn forth by her Servants, or were a^y other ways stirred,
presently they became still and convulsed, in manner of a Tetanus: to which is
added a certain convulsive moti^n like that of persons which have the
Falling Sickness, which is wont also frequently to take her of it self by fits.

5. And when she is taken with these symptoms, she perceives a kind of motion
in her Hypochondria, moreover she is frequently afflicted with wandering pains,
possessing diverse parts, but especially her Chest, so that sometimes the
forepart, other whiles the hinder part; now the right, anon the left part of
the Chest is troubled with these running Pains; this is the History of the
Disease, related by the Patient herself, who returning from the Baths which she
had used in vain, desired my advice.

6. I could have indeed wished that the Disease had been more exactly
described, by those skillful Physicians, who had her under Cure, to the end
that the nature of so most intricate and difficult a Disease, might be the
better known, and the Cure more solidly undertaken, by a diligent disquisition
of all the Circumstances thereof.

7. Yet I shall not forbear to gratify the desire of the Patient in showing my
opinion, submitting the same to the judgment of those most expert Physicians
who are able to take Cognition of all the particularities of the said disease,
and to see perfectly into the nature thereof.

8. I conceive therefore, that it is no true Palsy arising from a phlegmatic
humor, loosning and resolving the Nerves, but rather that it is a mixed Disease,
consisting partly of a bastard Palsy, and partly of a Convulsion.

9. Now these bastard Palsies, compounded with distention, and Convulsions of
the Nerves are in those inferior Parts, often produced by Choleric,
Melancholic, or wheyish humors contained in the Hypocondria, or other parts of
the lower Belly, and translated into the Backbone.

10. From which seeing the Nerves to arise, which bring motion and sense into
the parts, as also into the Muscles and skin of the Belly, it is no wonder,
that the animal Actions of these Parts are very much hurt; this may be
confirmed by a large discourse, the judgment of Authors, and by Experience: but
unto such learned Men it may suffice, to declare a few things which make this
conjecture of mine sufficiently probable.

11. In the first place therefore, it must be taken as a certain and
unquestionable truth, that all deprivation of sense and motion does not draw
its original from the phlegmatic humor, but that it proceeds sometimes from a
hot and dry distemper, and humors following such a constitution.

12. This may be confirmed by the opinion of Trallianus alone, who in the 16.
chap. of his 1. Book, alleges such a cause, and confirms it with a clear
example in these words: I knew, truly, a Man that was palsied through sorrow,
much care and fasting, and having taken Hiera-picra, he became so bad, that he
could not stir at all, and was near to death, unless he had been altered to the
contrary, both with all kinds of moistening things and potions, and meats and
other things that might reduce him to his right temper, especially with Baths
and frequent anointings with Water and Oil, with mutation of the Air to a
temperate kind, and to use all kind of cheerfulness.

13. A story not much unlike to this may be seen in Forestus his 97. Observe. of
his tenth Book; of a certain young Man who being deprived of motion from his
Thighs to the Feet, with an extenuation and non-nutrition of the said parts,
and growing continually worse and worse by the use of hot and drying
Medicaments prescribed by other Physicians, at last he was cured by the above
mentioned Physician, only with moistening Medicaments, which were partly
taken-in, and partly applied externally.

14. Moreover it is a thing long since observed amongst practitioners, that
there is a choleric Cholick, which does frequently degenerate into a Palsy,
and that such a Palsy proceeds from Choler, no Man doubts.

15. And lastly, that from a Melancholic and wheyish humor, symptoms are
produced very like the Palsy and Convulsion, is every where related by such
Authors, as have written of the Scurvy and the Hypochondriacal Disease, as you
may see in Sennertus where he explains the symptoms of the aforesaid Diseases,
in his Book of the Scurvy, and of the Hypochondriacal Disease.

16. Now that those Impairments of sense and motion, which afflict this honest
Woman, does proceed from adult and hot humors, we may in the first place
Conjecture from such things, as help and hurt; For seeing she received no good
by heating and drying Medicaments, but was always worse after them, it follows
that they were no ways contrary to the Disease.

17. And this was the only way whereby Trallianus and Forestus, in the foresaid
Histories, came to the knowledge of a Palsy, proceeding from an hot and dry
distemper.

18. Secondly. That this Patient has a dry distemper, may be hence collected,
in the causticks applied to diverse Parts, and Issues made thereby afforded very
little humor, and were quickly dried up.

19. Thirdly, Palsies which proceed from Phlegm, draw their orginal from the
Brain, as the fountain of that humor; and those parts which are near the Head,
are commonly first and most of all hurt.

20. Whereas in the Patient, there are no signs of any humor flowing from the
Head, nor is there any hurt in her upper parts, so that her Arms, Hands and
other upper-parts do perfectly perform their Actions.

21. Fourthly, the first Insult of the Disease did cause a dullness of the
sense of feeling in her Belly and the Muscles of the Abdomen, which shows that
the Nerves which spring out of the Backbone, through the Vertebrae of the
loins were first hurt; and that afterward the Disease was propagated to the
Nerves, which arise from the Os Sacrum, and crept along to the Thighs and Legs.

22. Whence may be gathered that the humor offending transferred from the parts
contained in the lower Belly unto those Nerves, just as in a Palsy following
after the Cholick, such a like translation is wont to happen.

23. Fifthly, pains afflicting diverse parts, especially about the Breast, and
those so fleeting, do argue that sharp and biting vapors, are carried from the
Hypochondria into those parts; as like pains in such as are troubled with
Hypochondriacal Melancholy, do most frequently happen.

24. Sixthly, as often as the Patient's Feet and Legs are stirred, a stretching
and trembling motion does presently arise, which argues that the matter
impacted into the Nerves is thin and moveable, and consequently put into
agitation by the least stirring, by that means causing tensions and vibrations
of the Nerves.

25. Seventhly, when the Convulsions seize upon this Woman, a certain motion
goes before in her Bowels, which she plainly perceives, which motion proceeds
from the aforesaid matter, beginning to work and stir it self, or from vapors
raised out of the said matter by its commotion; as in a sympathetick Epilepsy,
arising from the inferior parts: such commotions are perceived in the Belly,
when the fit is about to come.

26. Lastly, this Disease began to show it self after the Patient had
miscarryed and took its increase, during the time of her afterward being with
Child; which signifys that a bad humor collected in the veins of the Womb, not
sufficiently voided by the monthly purgations, did fall into those nervy parts,
and did at last cause these impediments of sense and motion.

27. These things thus laid down, let us come to the Cure, which must be
directed to these indications, viz. that the hot and dry distemper of her
Bowels be corrected; that the Melancholic and burnt humors (which I take to be
the chief cause of these symptoms) be prepared and evacuated, the obstructed
passages be opened, and the chief Bowels producing these humors be strengthened.

28. I shall briefly propound such Materials, as are fit to satisfy these
Indications, and those the choicest, promising this Prognostic, that Diseases
proceeding from Melancholy, are of all others most hard to cure; and if they
seize upon the Nerves, they are yet harder to cure, and confirmed old Diseases
of the Nerves are Incurable; whence it follows, that this case propounded is
hardly vanquishable by remedies, and that there is little hope of cure.

29. I advise nevertheless that this cure should be undertaken, seeing many
things daily fall out besides hope, and many Diseases are cured, which were
accounted desperate.

30. In the first place therefore, her Diet must be of good meats and easy
digestion, somewhat cooling and very moistening; of which kind are the flesh of
young Beasts, and new soft Eggs, the other particular of her Diet, are left to
the prescription of Physicians.

31. The rest of the Cure must be begun with the laxative Clyster, after which
must follow the next day, Blood-letting in her left Arm, to eight ounces. And
if the Blood be corrupt, or infected with any bad quality, she must be let
Blood again the next day, out of her other Arm, in like quantity.

32. After bleeding let her use the following Broths: Take roots of Bugloss and
Asparagus, of each one ounce: leaves of Agrimony, Ceterach, Maidenhair and
Cichory, of each one handful: boil them in Cock-broth, and dissolve therein one
dram of Cream of Tartar; let her take thereof for twelve days together.

33. In every fourth Broth, infuse all Night three drams of Sena, one dram of
Aniseed, and in the strained liquor dissolve one ounce and half of choice
Manna. Let her take it and be ordered accordingly.

34. Her Broths being ended, let her use a Bath to sit in lukewarm, of a
decoction of Barley and sweet Almonds: let her sit in it twice a Day for three
days together, at good distance from meal-times.

35. The Day after her last use of the Baths, let the Vein of her left Ankle be
opened, and take away six ounces of Blood.

36. Afterward let her drink the Whey of Goats-Milk for fifteen or twenty
days, taking at first one Cup, afterward two or three, as her Stomach can
bear, for the more she shall drink, the more good it will do her: now the Whey
must be presently made, before she takes it, of Milk newly milked, by boiling
the same one walm, and as soon as it begins to boil, therein to sprinkle, a
little quantity of Juice of Lemons or Vinegar, and presently removing it from
the Fire; for presently the Whey will be separated from the cheesy substance,
which is made exceeding clear by straining and clarifying the same with the
white of an Egg, and may be drunk in great quantity without offending the
Stomach, so that it is by many drunk after the rate of mineral Waters, with
great profit.

37. Every fourth or fifth day let two ounces of Manna be dissolved in her
first Cup of Whey: during the rest of the Summer, let the Bath to sit in be
repeated once or twice a week, that her Hypochondria may be moistened, and the
Acrimony of the offensive humor tempered.

38. If she be not loose-bellied, let her take a Clyster every other day.

39. Take Conserve of Eglantine-berries, four ounces: Conserve of the Flowers
of Borrage, Violets, and Tamarinds, of each two ounces: Conserve of the roots
of Elecampane, and Citron-Peels preserved, of each half an ounce:
Ivory-shavings, two drams: Salts of Wormwood, and Tamarisk, of each one dram
and half: two preserved Myrobalans, Confectio Alkermes, half an ounce: with
Syrup of Maidenhair make an Opiate, of which let her take the quantity of a
Ches-nut every Morning, two hours before meat, and drink a little Wine allayed
with Water after it.

40. And because the Disease is very stubborn, and cannot be vanquished, unless
by Remedies very long continued; in Autumn the Cure must be begun again,
beginning with a Clyster, then letting-blood, after which the following Apozem
shall be used for 12 days together.

41. Take root of Asparagus, Butchers-broom and Bugloss, of each one ounce:
roots of Enu^acampane, Bark of Caper-roots, middle Rind of Ash, and Tamarisk,
of each half an ounce: Leaves of Agrimony, Borrage, Burnet, Cichory, Ceterach,
Maidenhair, of each one handful: fragrant Apples ripe and cut into bits,
number two: Flowers of Borrage, Violets, and Tamarisk, of each one pugil: boil
them to a pint for three Doses; adding to each Dose one dram of Crystal of
Tartar, Salt of Wormwood, and Tamarisk, of each one scruple: Syrup of
Maidenhair, one ounce: let her take it for twelve days, in the Morning, three
hours before Meat, renewing the Decoction every third day.

42. In every four^h Dose infuse all Night three drams of Sena, Aniseed, one
dram: and in the strained Liquor dissolve two ounces of choice Manna: let her
take it and order her self accordingly.

43. After the Apozem let her again use the Bath to sit-in according to the
aforesaid Directions: the day after her last use of the Bath, let her Fundament
be chafed with a course Cloth, and fasten two Horse-Leeches, to those Parts
that swell most, and draw away five or six ounces of Blood.

44. The next day make Issues in both her Legs on the inner side, and keep them
open a long time.

45. Take Juyces (newly pressed forth, and clarifyed over a gentle Fire,) of
Borrage, Bugloss, Fumitory, Cichory and Endive, three pints: Juice of fragrant
Apples newly pressed out and clarified, two pounds: Sena, six ounces:
Epithymum, three ounces: Agarick newly trochiscated, and choice Rhubarb, of
each one ounce and half: Mace, and Cloves, of each one dram: infuse them and
boil them according to Art, till there remain fifteen ounces: And therein
dissolve fifteen ounces of Sugar, make all into a Syrup perfectly boiled, of
which let her take two ounces twice or thrice in a Month, in chicken broth
boiled with leaves of Borrage, Bugloss; Agrimony and Pimpernel: let her
continue the use of the aforesaid Opiate on all such days, as are free from the
use of the other Medicaments, Riverius, Lib. 2. Observe. 198.

XXXVIII. A Palsy in one side of the Body.

1. A Man about fifty years of age, had been afflicted four Months with a Palsy
of one side of his Body; viz. the right Side, so that he that he could hardly
speak or pronounce his Words plain; he was for a whole year troubled with this
Disease, and in that while he used many Medicaments to no purpose.

2. But I undertaking his Cure; gave him a Bolus of Bezoardicum Minerale,
twelve grains: with Conserve of Roses, which he was to take twice a day, and
every fifth day one scruple of the smaller Cochiae-Pills with eight grains of
Mercury calcined, per se, without Corrosives; with which being continued for 20
days together, he was perfectly cured. Riverius, Observe. 594.

XXXIX. A Palsy in an ancient Gentlewoman.

1. A Gentlewoman about sixty four years of age, a little before the setting
of the Pleides, fell suddenly in the Evening into a Palsy of her right Side: so
that she could not distinctly speak, nor had she the Power of Sense or Motion
in her Limbs, on that Side: Moreover she was exceedingly heavy in her Head and
inclined to sleep.

2. Now because her Belly was bound, a Clyster was presently injected, partly
of emollient, partly of cephalic Herbs, in the straining whereof, was
dissolved the Hiera Picra of Nicolaus with Diaphaenicon, Oil of Cammomil and
Mel Anthosatum, or Honey of Rosemary-Flowers, which she voided after an hour
with much Dung and phlegmatic Excrements.

3. At midnight I caused her to swallow seven Pills of Pil. Faetidae and
Cochiae, with three grains of Troches of Alhandal made up with Syrup of
Staechas, which about Morning brought away so great a quantity of thick and
clammy Phlegm, that the heaviness of her Head, and Sleep seemed to be very much
abated.

4. On the third day she took an Apozem made of Galangal roots, Calamus
Aromaticus, Betony, Bawm, Chamepytis, Sage, Hysop, and others of this sort,
with Oxymel of Squills, whereof she took four Doses for the four ensuing
Mornings.

5. After which having taken again the aforesaid Pills, she was somewhat better,
yet she was not able to stir so much as her little Finger on the Side affected.

6. These things being done, certain snotty Excrements of her Brain, were
voided at her Nostrils and Mouth, by the use of Errhins and Apophlegmatisms,
but three days after she used a Diet-Drink of Guajacum Morning and Evening,
whose strained Liquor was aromatized with Powder of Nutmeg, whereof she always
held a bit under her Tongue, and sometimes with Diamoschi Dulcis.

7. Having drunk this Drink with the second Decoction for the space of five and
twenty days, her palsied Members had recovered some Sense, and could stir a
little, but after she used Stoves to procure Sweat, wherein many red hot Stones
were quenched in a Decoction of Bay Leaves, Lavende^, Bastard Spike, Flowers of
the two sorts of S^aechas, Cammomil, Maidenhair, and Sweat was provoked.

8. And she was anointed with hot Ointments of Martiatum, Opopanax, Oil of
Castoreum, of the Peppers, Oil of Foxes, and other such like, all over her Back
bone, and the Members affected, she totally recovered her Health: not to speak
how I appointed her to keep a drying Diet all the course of the Disease. By
this Method I have cured many that could not speak, nor stir their Limbs.
Riverius, Lib. 4. Observe. 720.

XL. A Palsy which came by taking cold in the Rain.

1. A Man about forty years of age, phlegmatic, going a Journey in a rainy and
wet Season, awaked in the Night, and was afflicted with an impotency of Motion
and Sense, and returning home, within 3 weeks he was Paralytical.

2. Wherefore by the command of a certain Mountebank they laid upon all Parts,
Brine where before Beef had been seasoned, after the application of which he
felt a great Pain. I prescribed him the following things by which he recovered;
except that the Parts were not so strong as before.

3. Take of the Water of Carduus Benedictus, two ounces: the simple distilled
Water of Treacle, six drams: the Anti-Paralytical-Water, three drams: the
Spirit of Salt Armoniack, sixteen drops: mix them for a draught: which being
taken in the Evening, he sweat according to our desire.

4. Secondly, we ordered the Nape of the Neck, the Neck, and the Backbone to
be twice a day anointed with this following Liniment. Take Vnguentum Martiatum,
half an ounce: Oil of the Flowers of Cammomil, St John's wort, of each one
ounce: Oil of Juniper Berries, Castor, Laurel, of each two drams: the Juice of
Scurvy Grass strained, three drams: Allom, one dram: Spirit of Sal Armoniack,
two drams: Aqua Vitae Matthioli, half an ounce: mix them and make a Liniment.

5. Thirdly, he took every day, three or four times four ounces of the
following Decoction: Take the shavings of the Wood Guajacum, three ounces: the
Bark of the same, an ounce: Juniper-Wood, two ounces: Fountain Water, seven
pints: boil them according to Art three hours, and then add Juniper Berries, an
ounce: Angelica-root, half an ounce: the Leaves of Marjoram, Sage, Rosemary, of
each half an handful: Sena cleansed, an ounce: Hermodactyls, six drams: boil
them again in a Vessel close shut, to four pints, to which being strained, and
Antiparalytick-Water, simple distilled Water of Treacle, of each an ounce and
half: Spirit of Salt Armoniack, one dram: mix them and put them into a stone
Vessel close shut.

6. Every week he took the following Pills and thereby had three or four
stools: Take Pil. Fetidae the greater, half a dram: Resin of Jalap, Alhandal
Troches, of each four grains: Oil of Rosemary distilled, four drops: mix them
and make seven Pills.

7. These things were used about two Months, the Liniment being a little
sometimes altered, to wit, two drams of the Oil of Spike, and the Juice of the
stinging Nettle the lesser, half an ounce being added.

8. I also prescribed the following physical Wine: Take of the Herb Germander,
Ground Pine, of each one handful: Primrose-leaves, half an handful: Rosemary,
Sage, and the Flowers of Rosemary, of each an handful: the root of Master-wort,
Angelica, Florentine-Orris, black Hellebor, seeds of Carthamus, of each three

Parts, as Saffron is of the Lungs) white Agarick, three drams: Cardamoms,
Cubebs, of each two drams: Salt of Tartar, a dram and half: the Ingredients
being cut and grossly bruised, let them be put into a Bag, with six pints of
French Wine, and make it a physical Wine, of which (after a due Infusion) he
took three times a day three ounces, into which was always dropped eight drops
of the Spirit of Salt Armoniack; with all which things at the fourth Month he
was cured. Decker upon Barbett his Practice, Lib. 1. Cap. 3,

XLI. A Palsy with grievous Symptoms.

1. One about the age of five and thirty, fell into a Palsy of the right Side,
with most sharp pains of the forepart of the Head, the superior Vertebrae
being distorted; his Neck was so stiff and hard as if it had been a piece of
Wood; to which may be added his wearisom Watchings and deprivation of Rest and
Sleep, and frequent convulsive Motions in his Shoulders and Back, as also
Sorrow and an Apepsia.

2. This Malady growing every day stronger, another Physician did apply diverse
things in order to a Cure, but without Success, he prescribed purgative
Potions, and did not omit things proper for the Head and Phlegmagoges, he did
repeat twice Phlebotomy in his Arms, a Seton was put to the Nape, and
Horse-Leeches to the Fundament; Cupping-glasses to the Shoulders, and the Arms
were burnt with Causticks.

3. This miserable Man repaired to me as his last Refuge; at first I gave him
Pil. Catholicae Poterii, which are made as follows: Take fine Aloes, half an
ounce: Myrrh, two drams: Mastick, one dram: Crocus Oriental, half a dram:
Magnesiae Saturninae Meteorizatae, one dram: with Syrup of Roses solutive, make
a Mass. Dose from fifteen grains to four and twenty.

4. Those Pills are happily exhibited and very profitable in all Diseases
proceeding from Intemperance, they cure Pains of the Cholick, and wonderfully
succor in the Asthma, and help the Megrim, Vertigo, Epilepsy, and give ease to
the Pains of the Gout.

5. On the following days this Decoction was given him. Take Lignum Sassafras,
one ounce: Bay Berries, one ounce and half: let them be infused in six pounds
of White Wind for twelve hours; then boil them to a Consumption of the third
part, strain and then take of the Colature twice a day, early and late five
ounces for a Dose.

6. Within eight days thereafter the Pain of his Head and the Palsy with all
its Symptoms vanished. Poterius, Cent. 2. Cap. 26.

XLII. A Palsy of the Tongue and the left Arm.

1. A certain reverend Father about the age of forty seven was taken suddenly
with a Palsy: upon which having lost his speech and the motion of the left
side, a grievous numbedness also seizing him in that side, I came presen^ly to
him and gave him our Aurum Diaphoreticum, six grains: (with half an ounce of
Treacle Water) which is made thus.

2. Take one part of the purest Gold, the Mercury of Antimony a sufficient
quantity: dissolve and make an Amalgama; boil it over a gentle fire for the
space of four days in a glass vessel a cubit and a half high, the lower part
whereof being large and wide, but the upper part strait and long; let the fire
be gentle and continual; this way the Amalgama is turned into a very red
powder; which for the space of fifteen days lay in Horse-dung, circulating it
with the spirit of Wine, at last draw off the spirit, and then you have your
Gold prepared, dose from four grains to six or seven in any conserve, or Wine
or Broth of flesh.

3. After he had taken this he began by little to speak and move his Arm; in
the Evening this Medicine being repeated again, he grew perfectly well.
Poterius, cent 2. cap. 66.

XLIII. A Palsy in a young Gentleman.

1. A very considerable Gentleman about the age of twenty five, after a Fever
fell into a most grievous Disease, to wit, the Palsy, by which his Mouth and
Eyes were distorted, which was accompanied with a thickness of hearing, and a
continual Headache; as also with frequent vomitings, watchings, gnawing of the
Stomach, want of appetite, costiveness and great weakness.

2. The advice of two Physicians was made use of for destroying so many evils,
but in vain; but under our Care he was restored to his former Health by these
following things:

3. At first because of the loss of his strength we had regard to the Stomach,
administering twice a day our Stomachical Specific and our Aurum Diaphoreticum,
which we have already described in the last Section 2. by which he was
discernably releived.

4. For removing the pains of the Head, Pil. Polychrestae and Catholicae, were
of great use, as also the Balsam of Vitriol. Poterius, cent. 2. cap. 92.

XLIV. Of the Palsy, and gangreen with a mortification.

1. There was a certain person aged twenty five years, whilst he was taking his
diversions in the Country; and was in his Journey homewards to the City, he
contracted a great heaviness in his Head, after he was returned home he felt in
a few days that he could not walk, he was sensible of a very great Pain a
little above the Os Sacrum, to whom happened afterward stinking Urine.

2. His Body being gently purged with the following decoction, we gave him
Turpentine for a month: the decoction was thus; Take Lignum Sassafras, Misletoe
of the Oak, of each half an ounce: the leaves of Gout-Ivy, Betony, Ceterach,
Pimpernel, Cichory, of each one handful: Dodder, Epithymum, Carthamus-seed, of
each six drams: Sena, one ounce: Anise, two drams: Liquorish, half an ounce:
the decoction was prepared in a sufficient quantity of water, strain, of this
Colature there was given five ounces for a dose twice a day, for twelve days.

3. Take Turpentine, three drams: washed in the water of Betony; at Intervalls
there was added one dram of Rhubarb beaten into powder.

4. To be applied outwardly, a half Bath was thus prepared: Take
Juniper Berries, two pound: Bay Berries, one pound: the leaves of Rosemary,
Sage, Mint, Marjoram, Wormwood, Calamint, Origanum, Rue, Cammomil, Melilot, of
each four handfuls: the flowers of Staechas, Roses, of Rosemary, of each three
pugils: boil them in Wine and Water for a half-Bath.

5. This being done, anoint the Parts affected with the following Ointment:
Take Oil of Badgers, Oil of Foxes, of each six ounces: Oil of Worms, Oil of
Bays, of each one pound: Petroleum, one ounce: Aqua Vitae, four ounces: mix for
a Liniment.

6. Acetum Minerale was used for a mortification, and a digestive of the Yolks
of Eggs was applied.

7. And because the Cure went on but slowly, we gave him often Aurum
Diaphoreticum with Conserves, and so at length he attained to firm Health by
these Remedies. Poterius, Cent. 2. Cap. 94.

XLV. A Palsy with a troublesome Hiccough.

1. A certain Pastor was taken with a Palsy, with a numbedness of the Fingers

cleansed, but was very much afflicted for three days, Night and Day with a
troublesome Hiccough, his urine was pale, yet clear enough, having therein
plenty of a sandy sediment.

6. I prescribed the following Stomachical tragea: Take Aniseeds, five ounces:

then put into a Platter, in which a Rag may be dipped.

12. Afterward he may anoint himself with the Oil of Honey and Mastick; these
Remedies being diligently used, he was freed from this troublesome Hiccough.

and of Fennel-seeds, of each two drams: Sugar of Roses tabulated, three drams:

Blessing of God made perfectly well. Gruling. Cent. 1. Observe. 37.

XLVII. A Palsy from the Cholick.

1. A certain Canon having the Cholick, was totally resolved, and deprived of
the motion of all his Members, the morbifick matter being translated to the
musculous and nervous Parts, intercepting the passage of the animal Spirits.

2. Several convenient purgatives and sudorificks of the Decoction of Lignum
Sanctum and Sarsaparilla were administered by me without giving ease, at length
by the divine Benediction he was wholly recovered by the benefit of a Bath of
the Decoction of Cammomil, Sage, Marjoram, Origanum, Rosemary, Mint, the
berries and tops of Juniper. Thonerus, Lib. 2. Observe. 8.

XLVIII. A Palsy of both Legs in a young Girl.

1. A Maid about ten years of age, was taken with a Palsy of both Legs, and
totally deprived of motion from the obstruction of the Nerves proceeding from
the Os Sacrum, by thick phlegmatic humors shutting up the passage of the animal
Spirits.

2. These following things were ordered for evacuating the phlegmatic humors,
this laxative Hydromel was prescribed: Take roots of Elecampane, Fennel,
Orrice, of each two drams: Betony, Bawm, Rosemary-Flowers, Sage, of each one
pugil: the Leaves of Sena, one ounce: fresh Agarick trochiscated, half an
ounce: Mechoacan, three drams: the best Turbith, two drams: the lesser
Galangal, one dram: make a Bag for three pints of Mead, of which a quarter of a
pint is to be taken at once.

3. The Body being thus cleansed, the above mentioned Balneum may be used, of
the Decoction of the Leaves of Sage, Origanum, Rosemary-Flowers, Marjoram,
Cammomil, the tops and berries of Juniper. Thonerus, Lib. 2. Observe. 9.

XLIX. A Palsy in an ancient Person.

1. A Person about seventy years of age, of a good habit and great strength of
Body; having too much accustomed himself to excess in Wines, fell suddenly into
a Resolution of the right Side, with a Torture of the Mouth; the Arm and Leg of
that Side were also resolved.

2. Being invited to give him a Visit, I ordered him the following Clyster:
Take Mallows, Marshmallows, Violets, Blites, the Herb Mercury, Bears-Breech,
of each one handful: Hysop, Centory the lesser, and Sage, of each half an
handful: Agarick tied in a thin Cloth, three drams: the seeds of Anise, of
Dill, of Caraways, of Rue, of each two drams: Polypody of the Oak bruised, one
ounce: the Flowers of Staechas, and of Rosemary, of each one pugil: course
Bran, two pugils: make a Decoction of all, and in one pound of the straining,
dissolve Catholicon, one ounce: Electuary of Indi-majoris, half an ounce: Oil
of Rue, and of Dill, of each two ounces: Honey of Rosemary-Flowers, one ounce:
Salt Gem, two scruples: mix them and make a Clyster.

3. This being injected, a wonderful plenty of watery and spumous Phlegm was
drawn forth, then on the very same day about two hours after the Clyster was
injected, I did draw a moderate quantity of Blood, out of the middle Vein of
the left Arm for revulsion, the quantity not exceeding six ounces (he was full
of Blood although an old Man.)

4. Being let blood and the sick ordered to rest one day, I prescribed these
easy Pills to be taken on the next day: Take Pil. Asajaret, and Cochy, of each
half a dram: Agarick trochiscated, one scruple: Mastick, Diagridium, of each
one grain; mix them, and with Sage-Water make seven Pills: let him take it
three hours after a light Supper.

5. Afterward I commanded the following Apozem, which warms the Nerves and
prepares and attenuates the Phlegm, to be taken eight-whole days together, and
immediately after I gave a Tablet made with the Syrup of Electuary Diamoschi.

6. Take roots of Male-Peony, one ounce: the roots of true Acorus, Galangal,
Elecampane, of each half a dram: the tops of Hysop, Sage, Marjoram, Primroses,
Germander, Ground Pine, of eace half an handful: Cubebs, Hartwort, of each two
drams: Juniper Berries, three drams: Liquorice scraped and bruised, half an
ounce: the Raspings of Lignum Sanctum, four ounces: infuse the roots and wood
in Water and White Wind, and boil them leisurely over a gentle Fire, afterward
add the leaves and seeds and make a Decoction, adding in the end the Flowers of
Sage, of Staechas, of Rosemary, and Bugloss, of each one pugil: to the
straining add Syrup of Maidenhair, Honey of Roses, Honey of Rosemary-Flowers,
of each four ounces: Sugar, a convenient quantity: make a Syrup clarified and
aromatized with choice Cinnamon, three drams: Nutmegs, one dram and half; for
four or six Mornings.

7. This Syrup did cause the sick to sweat, Nature being provoked and assisted
by laying on of Clothes; the Syrup being finished, and a digestion appearing
now in the Urine; I gave the following Pills.

8. Take Pil. Fetidae, and Cochiae, of each two scruples: Troches Alhandal, and
Mastick, of each two grains: with Sage-Water make nine Pills: These Pills did
work well, I gave in the Morning Conserve of Rosemary-Flowers with Mithridate,
having commanded the sick to abstain from any Nourishment for the space of five
hours, then I made for him such an Opiate, as was to be taken every other day
to the quantity of a Chest-nut a little Sage-Water being drunk thereafter.

9. Take Conserves of Rosemary-Flowers and Staechas, of each an ounce and half:
Conserves of Acorus, one ounce: Conserves of Sage, half an ounce: Ginger
bruised, three drams: Powder of Diamoschi Dulcis, one dram: Mithridate, two
drams: Powder of Nutmegs, one dram: seeds of Peony, and grains of Juniper, of
each two scruples: the Brains of a Hare roasted, one dram: mix them and with
Oxymel of Squills make it up after the manner of an Opiate to be taken as
aforesaid.

10. The sick did declare that he was wonderfully helped by this, and that he
was sensible of a pleasant kind of heat which by virtue of this Medicament had
comforted his Members.

11. Then I used Topics, first I ordered Errhines of the Decoction of Elder
and black Beets with Agarick and a little Ginger; there being added in the
straining the purple Flower of Pimpernel, one ounce.

12. First I ordered that the places affected and the roots of the Nerves about
the Backbone should be anointed with the following Oils I shall begin with
those that are lightest and easiest: Take Oil of Cammomil, white Lillies, of
each two ounces: the Oil of Wall-Flowers, and Bays, of each one ounce: mix them
and anoint the Backbone with these warm.

13. Afterward I did appoint this more efficatious Ointment, by theuse of
which this sick Man was by Gods Blessing freed: Take Sage, Marjoram, Bays,
Betony, Rosemary, Primroses, of each one handful: the roots of true Acorus,
fresh Orrice, of each three ounce: Oil of Foxes, of the Indian-nut, and of Rue,
of each one pound: Oil of Turpentine, half a pound: strong Wine, one pound:
Aqua Vitae, half a pound: boil them all together to the consumption of the
Wine, strain and add to the straining Sagapenum, Opopanax, Bdellum, of each two
drams: Castor, half an ounce: Mace, Nutmegs, Styrax Calamitae, Benjamin, of
each three drams: long Pepper, Pyrethrum, of each one dram: the Fat or Grease
of C^ts, of a Serpent, of a Goose, of each one ounce: Propollis or Virgins-wax,
two ounces: the marrow of an Oxes Leg, the Juice of Dwarf Elder, Sage, and
Bawm, of each four ounces: mix them, and with a sufficient quantity of wax
melted in the aforesaid Oils, they are all reduced to the form of an Ointment
of a middle consistency, with which I advise that the whole Backbone be
anointed warm.

14. Moreover I order that there be applied for drying soft woollen Clothes
fumigated with the following Fumigation: Take Frankincense, Mastick, Gum
Juniper, of each one ounce and half: the Gum of Ivy and Nigella torrefied, of
each one ounce: Benjamin, Styrax Calamitae, of each half an ounce: Coriander,
Mace, Nutmegs, of each one dram: Rosemary-Flowers, Staechas, of each one pugil:
make a suffumigation, all being bruised after a gross manner, that the soft
woollen Cloth may be the more fumigated: and let them be applied warm to the
Backbone after anointing.

15. After this was done, he could move the Arm and Leg which had been formerly
affected; after he had followed this course of anointing for the space of
twenty days, and had taken the usual Pills and the aforesaid Confection, and
had observed a good Diet, he was restored to perfect Health; having recovered
Sense and Motion, which I looked upon as somewhat miraculous, seeing the Disease
it self is of its own nature almost incurable, and the sick had arrived to the
seventieth year of his age.

16. That this Person of so great an age, and afflicted with so great a
Disease, ever recovered must be attributed to the immense Power of God
Almighty. Franciscus Valeriola, Observe. 4. Lib. 4.

L. A light or gentle Palsy.

1. Diet is so to be ordered, as that it may warm indifferently; dry, cut
lightly, attenuat and cleanse.

2. Herbs, moist meats, and flatulent, fruits and Rape; meats that are slow of
digestion and clammy, must be abstained from, as also Milk the Entrals of
Beasts and their Heads; Mutton a little salted is good, which is better roasted
than boiled, flesh that is roasted is to be stuck with Cloves, Cinnamon,
Orange-peels, Rosemary, Sage, Hysop, Marjoram, Origanum, Rue, and the like,
with which boiled Meats may be seasoned.

3. Physicians have found by experience that Pigeons, especially those that
haunt Woods have been profitable in these kind of Diseases; fish must be used
seldom, as also Wine.

4. Let his drink be made of Hydromel prepared after this manner: Take pure
water, twenty six measures: Honey, one measure and half: boil it over a slow
fire scum it always, being thus scumed and by boiling reduced to twenty
measures, then add the roots of Florentine Orris or Elecampane two ounces: the
flowers of Hops, two handfuls: when the straining is almost cool, you many add
and mix therewith Ale-Yest to cause it to work.

5. In the Evening scatter a little of the powder of Cloves in the hinder part
of the Head near the Coronal future; But if the heat of the Cloves be feared,
being bruised a little, dip them in Rosewater, and being dried, let them be
pulverized, and keep the powder for use.

6. Comb your Head with an Ivory Comb or rather with one made of Lignum
Guajacum, which being done, rub the Head with warm Cloths and let the Head be
thereafter covered; It will be very convenient to swallow eleven Pills of this
following Mass once every week, or at least once a fortnight, either before the
full Moon or new Moon: For they are most fit and proper in this Disease and may
be taken without the least disadvantage.

7. Take Pill. de Hiera, three drams: Pill. sine quibus, fresh Agarick
trochiscated, of each one dram: Castor, nine grains: with Honey of Roses make a
soft mass.

8. Use this powder to the quantity of one dram in a little Wine or Broth, or
the water of Carduus Benedictus, or dip a piece of Bread toasted in Wine and
sprinkle thereupon a little powder and eat it in the Morning: Take the seeds of
Peony, Coriander prepared, Nutmegs, Misleto of the Oak, of each half an ounce:
Galangal, Cubebs, the root of Tormentil, of each one dram and half: the seeds
of Rocket, white Ginger, of each one dram: the tops of Rosemary, two drams: of
the whitest Sugar, three ounces and half: make a fine powder. It may be taken
sometimes in the Evening after Supper as much as the sick can contain within his
three Eingers.

9. Let him use this following Electuary every Morning to the quantity of a
Walnut; which is more pleasant, less warming and drying: Take Conserve of the
flowers of Rosemary, one ounce and half: Conserve of the flowers of Bugloss,
one ounce: Citron or Orange-Peels, the roots of Sea Holly confected, Ginger
confected, of each one ounce: the roots of Cichory condited, ten drams: the
seeds of Rocket, long Pepper, of each half a dram: Species Diambrae, one dram
and half: with the Syrup of conserved Nutmegs: mix them and make an Electuary;
Reinerus Solenander, Consil. 13. Sect. 2.

10. In the first place the Pills of Matthiolus are to be used, which if
continued long; they will be of great advantage in this Disease; the
composition is after this manner: Take Ground Pine, the Flowers of Betony, the
Flowers of Staechas, the Flowers of Primrose, of each one dram: fresh Agarick
trochiscated, two drams: gummy Turbith, one dram and half: Rhubarb to be
moistened with Cinnamon Water, one dram: Troches-Alhandal, half a dram:
Diagridium, one dram: white Ginger, Sal Gem, of each eight grains: Spica
Indica, six grains: the Powder of Hiera Simplex, half an ounce: with the Juice
of Ground Pine make Pills: of these every Evening after a slender Supper take
two or three about the time of going to bed.

11. But if this cannot be done every day, you must endeavor that it be done
often and almost every day; for by the use of these the excrementitious humor
which used to come from the Head and elsewhere, to the Part affected, is
checked and averted.

12. If indeed the Body stand in need of Evacuation, then after these three
Pills to be taken in the Evening, you must swallow other eight or nine in the
following Morning very early, abstaining from Meat for four or five hours
thereafter.

13. I would have the following Electuary to be used every day as well as the
aforsaid Pills: Take Galangal, Ginger, Nutmeg, of each one dram and half:
Cassia Ligna or Cinnamon, two drams: Cubebs, roots of Peony, of each five
scruples: Herba Paralysis (that is Cowslips) seed of Southern-wood, roots of
vulgar Acorus, of each three drams and half: Marjoram, Flowers of Rosemary,
Sage, of each two drams: Betony, one dram and half: long Pepper and white,
Saffron, of each one scruple and half: the Flowers of Staechas, one dram: the
Honey of Rosemary-Flowers, and Roses, of each nine ounces: Syrup of conserved
Ginger, and Nutmegs, of each half a pound: the Water of Ground Pine or the
Water of Carduus Benedictus, three ounces: boil them all together over a gentle
Fire to a consistency, then add the rest each one by themselves pulverized; and
first mixed, make an Electuary according to Art.

14. Make use always of this Electuary in the Morning, so as that after the
Mouth is washed, two drams thereof more or less be taken three or four hours
before Meat, or that some thereof by it self be taken solid on the point of a
Knife, or dissolved in the Water of Ground Pine, or Rosemary, or Betony, or
Carduus Benedictus, or in a little of Vinum Medicatum.

15. As to Externals, I do advise that the hinder parts of the Loins round
about and a little above the Os Sacrum, be anointed with hot Oil, and that
moderate Frictions be used to the Legs then warm.

16. And having anointed these Parts, defend the same from the injury of a
moist and cold Air by the Skins of Foxes or warm Clothes: let the Oil be this
following:

17. Take the Oil of bitter Almonds, half a pound: Rosemary-Water, one ounce:
Malago-Wine, one ounce: Pyrethrum bruised, six drams: Saffron, three drams:
Arabian Sanderack, Juniper Berries, of each one dram: boil them in a double
Vessel, to the diminishing of the Liquor, strain, and to the strained Oil add
the Oil of Castoreum, one ounce and half: mix, and use as is prescribed
Reinerus Solenander, Cons. 16. sect. 2.

LI. A Palsy of the Tongue.

1. Let there be held under the Tongue Castoreum or the Juice of Sage, or
Castoreum with the Juice of Peony; Castoreum, Cloves and Nutmeg in a Draught of
Wine is profitable.

2. The Friction of the Tongue and Pallat is very convenient, Treacle and
Mithridate being exhibited.

3. It is reported of a Woman who had lost the use of her Tongue; that by
taking thirty grains of Peony, the Bark being cast by, began presently to speak
again.

4. Letting of Blood in the Veins under the Tongue is also good, which is
afterward to be rubbed with Cresses and Castoreum.

5. An Emplaster made of Dogs Dung and Vinegar applied to the hinder part of
the Head, has restored again the lost use of speaking. J. Crato, Cons. 50. Lib.
6. Page 229.

LII. A Palsy from Phlegm.

1. A noble Matron of a pale Complexion being long affected with a Pain in her
Head proceeding from a pituitous humor that was gathered there, and the Winter
being exceeding rainy, fell first into an Apoplexy, then into a Palsy of the
Arm and Leg of the left Side, which stuck to her for some time.

2. For curing of this, seeing Phlegm abounds, from which the resolution has its
original, I judge it necessary that we begin first at those Remedies which are
weaker, and to proceed to those that are stronger.

3. There must be some Intervals between the use of Medicines, as for Meats
such as are roasted I judge to be better than those that are boiled, as also
drying Meats.

4. She must shun cold, moist snowy and rainy Weather; it will be convenient
that her Chamber be fumigated with Cloves.

5. The following Pills were ordered for her, Pil. de Hiera Simplex, two
scruples and half: Agarick trochiscated, one scruple: Castoreum, three grains:
make Pills: These she took twice a week.

6. Afterward the following digestive Syrup. Take Honey of Roses strained,
Syrup of Staechas and Betony, of each one ounce and half: with the Decoction of
Sage, Hysop, Gout-Ivy, and Cowslips, one quart: with Nutmeg and Galangal,
aromatize, mix for three Doses to be taken in the Morning.

7. Afterward I did add Oxymel of Squills and Syrup of Staechas; I did use a
Decoction of Bay Leaves, as also other Herbs aforesaid, there being added also
the roots of Galangal, Elecampane, Guajacum, and such like.

8, Then I caused her to take Pil. de Hiera composita; lastly I came to use
Pil. Cochia, Pil. Faetidae, Opopanax, and Sagapaenum in a lesser Dose.

9. The Brain being afterward purged with proper Medicaments such as Errhines
and Masticatories; I came to use Conserves of Pyrethrum confected, Galangal
confucted with Honey, if it may be had, then the Conserves of the Flowers of
Sage, Rosemary-Flowers, Staechas, Treacle, Anacardiums confected, the golden
Mithridate of Alexander, Diambra, Diamoschi, Diagalanga, Diacastoreum, new
Conserve of Roses, Diacalamintha, and their Electuaries.

10. A Decoction of the root of the great Bur does move Sweat.

11. Then we come to Topics, and first we anoint the Nape and Backbone with
the Oil of Spiknard, and then with the Oil of Costus.

12. It will be very profitable at last to anoint the paralytick Members with
Oleum Philosophorum, Oil of Elder, Oil of Rue, and of Euphorbium.

13. But we begin at things more mild in Women, as first the Fat or Grease of a
Duck, of a Goose, of a Hen, then aftetwards of a wild Cat, Fox, Badger, lastly
of a Lion, Libard, and Vipers.

14. Take notice of those Ointments which are commended at the beginning, then
the middle sort of Ointments, which are not too strong: then such as are
strongest, and the most excellent spirituous Water of Rondeletius.

15. The following Drink was used in stead of Wine and Beer: Take the Flowers
of Rosemary, Sage, Betony, Staechas, of each one pugil: Fountain Water, nine
pounds: purified Honey, one pound: boil gently, clarify and aromatize with
Cinnamon, half an ounce: white Ginger, one dram and half: Galangal, half a dram:

16. We did anoint also with the Oil of Foxes and Turpentine, some drops of
Aqua Vitae rectified being added.

17. One Bettus found by experience that such as was paralytick got great good
by the following Ointment: Take Earthworms washed in Water (but rather in Aqua
Vitae) and dried in an Oven and pulverized, one pound: the Powder of Ginger,
Galangal, of each half an ounce: then confect it with Oil of Lillies or of
Costus, according to the testimony of this Man, this is a wonderful good
Medicine. Petrus Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 83.

LIII. A light Palsy.

1. A certain Person traveled in a very rainy, cold, and moist Season; it was
Winter, having carried his Cloak a long time wet about his Neck, the Muscles of
his Hands began to be resolved, the Nerves about the Nape being wet, which came
down to his Hands.

2. His Nape and Backbone about the first Vertebra, from whence the Nerves
have their Original, were anointed with the Oils of Bays, of Bricks, of Costus,
and of Turpentine; by this Remedy his Hands received Sense and Motion; his Arm
and Hand being also anointed, whereupon followed a Cure.

3. Another Person being in a Wine-Cellar, through the moisture of the place is
affected with a Resolution of the Members; when the Physicians could do him no
good, a Friend led him toward an Oven, or a very hot Stove, and there being
put into a Bed, he was made warm, and then covered him with Nut-Tree Leaves
warmed in the Oven; together with warm Clothes.

4. He did sweat exceedingly, which flowing forth plentifully, his paralytick
Members were warmed; whilst he sweated, he was often refreshed with the Broth
of a Capon, after this he grew presently well. Forestus, Lib. 10. Observes 84.

5. Take Rulandus golden Spirit of Life, one ounce: Syrup of Liquorice, one
dram: mix them: by this a wonderful quantity of watery and serous humidity was
evacuated; and his Speech restored firm and whole as formerly; yet before this
Purge was taken, as also in the very time of its Operation, I did anoint his
paralytick Tongue, by drops, with our Oil of Hazelwood, which had the good
Success of recovering him to his Health. Martinus Rulandus, Curat. 53. Cent. 7.

6. Another Person about sixty eight years of age was afflicted with a Palsy of
the Tongue: by my advise she infused for a Night the Flowers of Lavender in
burnt Wine or Aqua Vitae, afterward for some days in the Morning and a little
before going to bed, she took an ounce; from that time she began every day to
speak more right and plain. Martinus Ruladus, Curat. 55. Cent. 4.

LIVE. A Palsy after an Apoplexy.

1. A certain Person from a weak Ap^plexy fell into a Palsy, to whom we
exhibited the following Remedies; first because there was much legm mixed with
a plently of Blood; and the Face red, his strength continuing as yet firm, we
ordered a moderate quantity of Blood should be taken out of his sound right Arm
(for his lest Arm and Leg were paralytical) least his Body should be deprived
of too much heat.

2. There can be no more apt Remedy in the beginning of this Disease, as Aetius
witnesses, if there be nothing that hinders; than the opening of a Vein in the
soundest Parts, but as it is said before, it must be moderate, least the sick
be too much cooled.

3. Where the Palsy is begotten by degrees and of a long continuance, breathing
of a Vein is not convenient: afterward a Clyster being injected, we did digest
the peccant matter with the following Decoction.

4. Take the Leaves of H^sop, Sage, and Marjoram, Cowslips, Gout-Ivy,
Bay Leaves, of each one handful: make a Decoction, and in one pound of the
straining add Syrup of Hoar hound, of Hysop, of Staechas, of each one ounce:
mix them for three Doses to be taken in the Morning.

5. In the mean time I ordered that this Composition made of Water and Honey
should be drunk in stead of Beer for some days: Take Hysop, four handfuls:
Sage, Rosemary, of each two handfuls: boil them in Water to one pound and half,
add a sufficient quantity of Honey, make Mellicratum for a Drink.

6. Immediately after I gave these following Pills: Take Pil. Hiera,
Alephanginae, Agarick trochiscated, of each one scruple: with Sage-Water make
five Pills.

7. He ought not to use, Cassia, Manna, Whey, and Syrup of the Infusion of
Roses; as things not having Efficacy enough, although we ought not to use
things that are of operation too strong in the beginning of a Disease.

8. I prescribed afterward these following Pills: Take Pil. Faetidae, Pil.
Cochiae, of each one scruple: choice Turbith, and Castoreum, of each half a
scruple: Troches-Alhandal, two grains: with Sage-Water make seven Pills: let
them be taken after going to bed.

9. The Body being first well purged, then I ordered such things as were proper
for purging the Head: Take Nutmeg, Pyrethrum, white Pepper, of each one dram:
Hysop, half a dram: Raisons, one dram: with Honey, Mastick being added, make a
Masticatory.

10. Then let Errhines be made of the Juice of Beets, Marjoram, Rue, Coleworts,
with Honey clarified, to be drawn up the Nostrils.

11. Afterward he may use Consects of the roots of Acorus, Peony, Conserves of
Rosemary-Flowers, of Sage, Mithridate, Treacle, Diamoschu, and Castoreum a
little being added: let him take in the Morning Treacle one dram, with Wine to
provoke Sweat.

12. Lastly, we must come to Topics, the Nape and paralytick Members being
first rubbed with a hard Cloth, which you may anoint with an Ointment made of
Aregon, of Martiatum Oil of Costus, of Nard, and of Cats.

13. This latter is to be made thus: Take a very fat Cat, fed in the Kitchen,
which being unskin'd and exentrated, and the Head struck off, put for a whole
Night in Aqua Vitae, then in the Morning stuff the Cavities with Leaves of
Bays, Sage, Rue, Lavender, Rosemary: moreover you, must stick therein also Lard
and Cloves, when you have thus done, roast it before a gentle Fire; that which
drops forth, esteem it for a most convenient Liniment: and the Member which is
affected is to be rolled up carefully in Foxes or Cats skins.

14. By these Remedies this Man and many others were restored to perfect Health.

15. Likewise some paralytick Persons have used with advantage a Decoction of
Guajacum, such herbs being added as strengthen the Nerves, to wit. Cowslips,
Gout-Ivy, Betony, Lavender, Rosemary.

16. Some have ordered, where other Remedies have not availed, that they repair
to Baths, where the Water comes from Sulphur or Alum.

17. The Bath may be made of a Decoction of a live Fox, Sulphur, Salt, Sage,
Dwarf-Elder, Mint, Mugwort, Bays and the like.

18. A Fox either dead or alive, boiled in Oil, gives a dessipating Virtue to
the said Oil, we have also made use of live Dogs cut in small pieces and put in
Oil, of which good has been got. Petrus Forestus, Observe. 82. Lib. 10. de
Cerebri Morbis,

LV. A Palsy easily cured.

1. These vulgar and common Medicines have been profitable to many: Take simple
Aqua Vitae, wherein digest for some time, Marigold-Flowers, Mace, Castoreum,
with a little Saffron, they give one spoonful thereof.

2. You may rub the resolved Members in the same Liquor, others take some
handfuls of the Leaves of Sage; boil them carefully in Wine, till the half or
two parts of three are consumed, of this Wine strained they give in the Morning
one ounce or two, Castoreum one scruple, or two scruples being dissolved
therein.

3. The Backbone as also the Part affected when they are made warm by
Friction, must be anointed in the Morning with the Oil of Costus well prepared,
to which I would have added the distilled Oil of Nutmegs and Cloves.

4. The Oil of Bricks, Petroleum, the Oil of Turpentine and Junipers will also
be convenient. Reinerus Solenander, Cons. 20. Sect. 2.

LVI: A Palsy variously cured.

1. Some have it for a Secret, to anoint the affected Members with the Fat that
falls from an old Gander roasted, in the whole Belly is sewed up first
Bdellium, Galbanum, Opopanax Ammoniacum, and the Flesh of a Fox.

2. But I have also used Sinapisms with great Success, Foxes skins undressed,
the Powder of Nutmegs, Cardamoms and Ivy, first macerated in hot Water, then
afterward dried in the Shadow, fumigated and applied are of great use.

3. Outwardly for the Head I have found by Experience that first a double
Cucupha is very good, made of Cephalic Flowers, the Wood of Aloes, Nutmegs and
the like.

4. Another is a Bath made of a Lie prepaped of the Ashes of Juniper and a
Decoction of the Cephalic Herbs, of Elder and Cloves. Julius Caesar Claudinus,
Consul. 135.

LVII. A Palsy in the Tongue.

1. The following Remedies were exhibited to a Man who had a Palsy in his
Tongue, accompanied with an Indisposition of his whole Body: Take
Fountain Water, six ounces: Oil of Vitriol, a sufficient quantity to correct
the Crudity of the Water: let the Person take each hour one spoonful of this
Water.

2. Now that this Disease might be vanquished, I prescribed this Cathartick
Potion: Take the Extract of Colocynthis, to the bigness of a Filberd-Nut: the
Whey of Milk, two ounces: mix them and drink them warm: upon which a plentiful
Evacuation of the Belly followed.

3. The Impediment of the Tongue still continuing the third day after the first
Purgation; I did repeat the Evacuation of the Body which was so replet with
humors.

LVIII. A Palsy coming on a sudden.

1. A certain Widow whilst in good Health, and eating at her own Table, was
taken suddenly with a Palsy; which deprived her both of sense and motion in the
one half of her Body; insomuch that she could neither move her left Hand or
Foot; yet her Intellectuals remained undisturbed.

2. There came to her an Emperick who in stead of doing her good, did do much
hurt; the third year of her Palsy, I being by Marriage nerely related to her,
endeavored to do her all the good I possibly could, though I could not root up
this Disease and restore her to perfect Health again.

3. Yet I attempted these following things for precaution: Take Conserves of
the Flowers of Betony, Sage, Rosemary, Cowslips, of each an ounce: the Powder
of Galangal, or the roots of true Acorus, two drams: the roots of Peony, one
dram: the roots of Elecampane confected, half a dram: there being also added
the Powder of Diacumin (for she was afflicted with Wind in the Stomach, and
belching because of her daily sitting) one dram and half: Species Aromatici
Rosati, two scruples and half: Species Diagalanga, Species Diarrhodon Abbatis,
of each one scruple and half: with Syrup hf Stoechas make an Electuary.

4. Afterward there was added Syrup of Mint, when she was ill in her Stomach,
as also the Species Aromatici Rosati was used in Tablets, but more frequently
the Conserves of the Flowers of Betony, Sage, and Rosemary; by which Remedies
she was preserved full eleven years from any further Palsy or Apoplexy.
Forestus, Lih. 10. Observe. 85.

LIX. A Palsy of the Tongue after an Ap^plexy:

1. Sometimes the Tongue is resolved and remains so after an Apoplexy; chiefly
in those, who during Health are addicted to Stammering; the whole Body being
purged and Head also, every Morning some of the following Electuary was used,
and now and then some grains of white Mustard Seed covered over with Sugar.

2. Take Conserves of the Flowers of Sage, Rosemary, of each one ounce: the
Conserves of the Flowers of Cowslips, of the Flowers of Betony, of each half an
ounce: the Powder of the root Galangal, and of Peony, of each one dram and
half: the roots of Elecampane confected, half an ounce: the Species Diamoschi
Dulcis and Amari, of Diambra, and D^alangal, of each one dram and half: the
Species Aromatici Rosati, the Species Laetitiae Galeni, (for the Person was
inclinable to Melancholy) of each half a dram: Mithridate confected, three
drams: Nutmeg confected, two drams: Oxymel of Squills, and Syrup of Staechas,
of each a sufficient quantity: make an Electuary indifferently liquid, and let
him take in the Morning the bigness of a small Chest-Nut thereof. P^tru^^^
Forestas, Lib. 10. Observe. 86.

LX. A Palsy of the Tongue happening suddenly.

1. A certain Tailor, whilst he sat at work at his Table, was suddenly taken
with a Palsy of the Tongue; to whom a Physician came, concluding that he was
troubled with a Lethargy; he having done him little good occasioned me to be
sent for, to whom I came on the sixth day of his Diseas^.

2. Finding him awake, yet not able to speak to me, nevertheless he followed
his Business every day; he had the use of his Reason; for by putting his Finger
upon his Tongue, he showed me where the Malady lay, and the Part affected, but
with indistinct Words or rather a mere Sound.

3. By which Signs I presently observed that his Tongue was resolved, as to his
Belly it was in such a Condition, as that he had not had so much as one Stool,
though it was the sixth day of his Distemper, therefore finding his Strength as
yet firm, I ordered the Injection of the following Clyster.

4. Take Centaury the lesser, Sage, Marjoram, Betony, Hysop, the Flowers of
Cammomil, of Melilot, of each half an handful: Aniseed, two drams: the seeds of
Peony, one dram: Pulp of Colocynthis, half an ounce, Agarick trochiscated, one
dram and half: Colocynthis and Agarick tied up in a round Knob, boil in common
Water, one pound: to the straining adding Hiera Picra, Benedictum Laxativum, of
each half an ounce: Diaphaenicon, three drams: Oil of Cammomil, Oil of Rue, of
each one ounce and half: common Salt, one dram and half: mix them and make a
Clyster: This purged the Belly thrice and eased it of many pituitous and viscid
Excrements.

5. On the Day following, Frictions of the Arms being first used; I commanded
two Cupping-Glasses with Scarification to be put to the Shoulders, and one to
the Neck without Scarification.

6. I opened a Vein under the Tongue, but he could not extend his Tongue,
wherefore having swallowed the following Pills of Cochiae, two scruples:
Castoreum, one scruple: and the Belly being soluble enough; I came to
Gargarisms and Apophlegmatisms, and then ordered the Tongue to be rubbed
strongly with Aqua Vitae and a little Treacle added.

7. The Forehead, Chin, and Nape were anointed with the Oils of Orrice and of
Dill; by which Remedies to the Admiration of all the Bystanders, he recovered
immediately his perfect Speech, and was happily delivered from the Palsy of the
Tongue. Petrus Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 87.

LXI. A Palsy of the Bladder.

1. The constringent Muscle of the Neck of the Bladder was resolved, by reason
of which the Urine came involuntarily; which sometimes also happens in an
Apoplexy, sometimes by a stroke or bruise, or from the inferior Vertebrae or
the Os Sacrum being hurt, or from too much Refrigeration.

2. These following things were prescribed, because the Urine could not he
retained: Take Electuary Lenitive, Hiera Picra Simplex, of each three drams:
Diaphaenicon, one dram: choice Rhubarb, Resin of Turpentine, of each two
scruples: Troches of Winter-Cherries without Opium, half a scruple: dissolve in
Mint-Water, or Wormwood, or in the Decoction of these Herbs, three ounces:
Honey of Roses strained, half an ounce: mix them and make a Potion, by which
much phlegmatic matter was twice evacuated.

3. Immediately the following Fomentation was used: Take Mint, Calaminth, red
Roses, of each one handful: Sage, Rue, Origanum, of each half an handful: the
roots of Elecampane, Galangal or the true Acorus, the roots of Cypress, of each
two drams: the Bark of Frankincense, Sumach berries, Maidenhair, Acorus,
Cypress-Nuts, Balaustians, of each one dram: make a Decoction in French-Claret
for one pound and half or two, to be used every Morning for a Fomentation to be
applied to the Breast.

4. Take roots of true Acorus, Cypress, of each three drams: Galangal, the Wood
of Aloes, Calamus Aromaticus cut, Cypress-Nuts: Balaustians, Pomgranate-Peels,
Myrtles, Acorn-Cups, the roots of Male-fern, Comfrey, of each one dram: Galls,
Frankincense, the seed of Agnus Castus, Rue, of each one scruple: choice
Cinnamon, half an ounce: being all pulverized let them boil in Claret, sugar
being added to give them a pleasant Taste, and according to Art make a Claret
for one pint and a half.

5. By this Claret I cured a Maid, which for the space of five years could not
retain her Water, especially in the Night; after the Fomentation I caused the
Womb to be anointed with the following Liniment.

6. Take Vnguentum Aragon, half an ounce: the Oil of Costus, and of Spike, of
each two drams: mix them.

7. There was taken every Day the quantity of a great Bean of this Mixture:
Take the Meal of dried Acorus, half an ounce: of Frankincense, two drams: the
Raspings of Ivory, Spodium, Cypress, Galangal, of each two scruples: make a
very soft Pulp, and force it through a Seive, to which add the Syrup of Mint, a
sufficient quantity: and make it after the manner of an Electuary moderately
liquid.

8. We also ordered the resolved Reins to be anointed with this Liniment: Take
Vnguentum Comitissa, Ceratum infrigidans Galeni, half an ounce: with a little
Oil of Mirtles: mix them.

9. Afterward because these things did not much relieve this Man, I prescribed
the following, which were used by another Physician with Success in the Cure of
one who had been troubled for eighteen years with this Disease of not retaining
of Urine.

10. Take Acorns, one ounce and half: Galangal, half an ounce: boil them in two
pounds of Claret and Smiths-Water, in which hot Iron is put, with two drams of
Frankincense, strain it; of this Decoction our Patient drank every Morning and
Evening, it did him much good.

11. We also anointed other Persons, who afrer the Epilepsy fell into a
Resolution of the Bladder with the Oil of Mastick and of Juniper, with a little
of the Oil of Turpentine being added, and by this alone he retained his Water
which before he could not.

12. There was also an old Man about the age of seventy who could not keep his
Water, to whom I ordered this following Cere-Cloath to be applied to his
Breast, by which he was cured.

13. Take Vnguentum Aragon, half an ounce: Oil of Wall-Flowers, of Costus, of
Spike^ard, of each two drams: Mastick, red Roses, Acorns, all pulverized, of
each half a dram: Frankincense, one scruple: Wax, a sufficient quantity: make a
Cere-Cloath, it was often reiterated.

14. After three years falling into the same Malady again, this Remedy
recovered the Person again.

15. Another Person a Country-Woman after Childbirth could not retain her
Water: First I gave have her these Pills: Take Pil. Hiera Simplex, Pil.
Mastick, of each half a dram: with the Syrup of Staechas, make seven Pills: let
them be given in the Morning.

16. She was of a phlegmatic, cold and moist Complexion, and this Malady was
increased by the great Flux of this pituitous humor, her Belly being loosned by
Pills, she did use this Claret.

17. Take Cypress, two scruples: grains of Myrtle, roots of Comfrey dried,
Cypress-Nuts, Balaustians, Sumach, of each one scruple: Wood of Aloes, Calamus
Aromaticus cut, of each two scruples: boil them in two pounds of rough Claret,
to one pound and half: let it be clarified and sweetened with two ounces of
white Sugar, and aromatize it with three drams of choice Cinnamon, Species
Diarrhodon Abbatis, Aromaticum Rosatum without Musk, of each one scruple: make
a Claret according to Art.

18. Presently after the following things were used: Take Cypress, two
scruples: grains of Sumach, Balaustians, Cypress-Nuts, Pomgranate-Peels, of
each half a scruple: the Wood of Aloes, Calamus Aromaticus cut in pieces, of
each two scruples: boil them all in two pounds of Claret, and in two ounces of
Horse-tail-Water, and make a decoction to one pound and half of Water: in which
let hot Steel be twice or thrice extinguished, then strain it, and aromatize it
with choice Cinnamon, two ounces and half: Species Diarrhodon Abbatis,
Aromaticum Rosatum, of each one scruple: Troches of Terra Sigillata, of Amber,
of each half a scruple: adding white Sugar for Taste, by which Remedies she was
helped. Petrus Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 92.

LXII. A Palsy of the Yard.

1. In the resolution of the Yard, as Actius in his Lib. Cap. 30. says, the
excretion of Urine is not stopped, but the ejection of the seed: this Evil is
most troublosom and inconvenient to such as are married.

2. We shall come to the Remedies, the Jelly of a Bulls or Hearts Pizel, and
Conserve of Satyrion, and a Confect of the same are good.

3. We advise that the Yard, Groin, and Thighs be anointed with the following
Ointment: Take the Fat of Foxes Stones, the Juice of Rocket, of each half an
ounce: the Gall of a Bull, one ounce: boil them to the consumption of the
Juice, and when it begins to grow cold, put into it the following Powder. Take
Pyrethrum, one dram: Euphorbium, half a dram: the seed of Rocket, two scruples:
make a Powder: and with the Oil of Nuts and Wax a sufficient quantity make an
Ointment.

4. We have used to give to one more phlegmatic, Conserve of Sarcocol and
confected Ginger, Pyrethrum confected and Pimpernel, and and of the Species of
Saxifrage confected, and Conserve of the root of Cow-Parsneps.

5. Much like to this was prescribed for an old Spaniard who would needs marry,
for the erection of his Yard which was paralytick: Take Oriental Saffron, long
Pepper, Cardamoms, Pyrethrum, of each half a dram: the tayls of Skinks with
their reins, two scruples: Galangal, four scruples: the seeds of Rape, of
Parsnip, of Rocket, of Nettles, Bird-tongue, of each one dram: Leeks, white
Ginger, choice Cinnamon, of each two scruples: the Electuary of Diasatyrion,
four ounces: with the Syrup of confected Ginger make a Mixture, which keep in a
glazed Vessel, let him take Morning and Evening the bigness of a Nut thereof,
drinking an hour after a Cup of a pleasant Wine.

6. And let this following Powder be taken before he go to bed: Take white
Ginger, one dram: Galangal, two drams: Bulls-Pizel dried and pulverized: make a
Powder, and give one dram or more in Wine.

7: There was also a Powder made of Pyrethrum, three ounces: Euphorbium, one
ounce: which was kept in a Bag of red Leather, about three spoonfuls whereof
were boiled in strong Wine, with which the Stones, Yard, Perinaeum and Thighs
were washed Morning and Evening.

8. The Feet and the Soles of the Feet, and the Hands and the Palms of the
Hands may be washed with that Wine: It was ordered for the Person that he
should eat Beans, Onions boiled, and roasted Parship Rape, with the Broth of
Flesh, made ready with Butter, Honey and a little Ginger. All which did very
much good. Forestus, Lib. 10. Cap. 83.

LXIII. A Palsy with an Atrophia of the Legs.

1. Although the restoration of wasted and decayed Strength depends chiefly
upon Diet, yet in the mean time there is great need of restorative and
corroborative Medicines, and of such as remove Obstructions: this following
Claret was used.

2. Take Fennel-roots and Parsly-roots (for without drying and heating much,
they open Obstructions of the Liver) Bugloss-roots, (for it comforts the Heart)
Mountain-Eryngo, (for it moistens and nourishes) of each one ounce: the
Cordial-Flowers, one pugil: common Maidenhair, red Maidenhair, Borrage,
Bugloss, Bawm of each one handful: Raisons, Currants, of each one ounce:
Liquorice scraped, half an ounce: boil them in two parts of Rhenish-Wine and
one part of Water to a pound, strain then aromatize with choice Cinnamon, three
drams: Species Rosatae Novellae, Species Electuarii Resumptivi, of each one
ounce: add to these a sufficient quantity of Sugar, and make a Claret according
to Art.

3. Then the following Electuary was used: Take Conserves of Borrage, of
Bugloss, Citron-Peels, of each two ounces: Species Diarrhodon Abbatis, Species
Trisantila, of each three drams: Pine-Nuts, Pistick-Nuts, of each half an
ounce: Species Resumptivae, two drams and half: Species Haly contra Tabem, one
dram: Species Aromatici Rosati, one dram and half: Conserve of Maidenhair,
half an ounce: sweet Almonds blanched and bruised, three drams: Syrup of
Maidenhair, Syrup of Vinegar, of each a sufficient quantity: make it after the
manner of an Opiate or liquid Electuary: He took thereof twice a Day to the
quantity of a Chest-Nut.

4. The next thing that we ordered, was Frictions first with the Hand, then
with a rough Cloth before a Fire for the space of twelve or more Days, then to
continue the use of the aforesaid Electuary, to which we did add for the
removing of the Obstruction of the Liver, the Species Diacurcumae, three drams:
but the Liver being now made more, free the Electuary was repeated without the
said Species Diacurcumae,

5. A while after the same was prescribed, but after this manner: Take
Conserves of Borrage, Bugloss, Citron-Peels, of each one ounce: the Species
Diarrhodon Abbatis, Species Resumptivae, Species Triasantila, Species Aromatici
Rosati, of each two drams: Syrup of Maidenhair, Syrup of Vinegar simple, of
each a sufficient quantity: make a Confection.

6. Then after this these Tablets were used: Take Species Resumptivae, two
scruples and half: the Species of Haly contra Tabem, Species Diarrhodon
Abbatis, Species Aromatici Rosati, Species Triasantila, of each one scruple:
dissolved in Borrage-Water, white Sugar, three ounces: make a Confection in
Rowls weighing three drams: let him take one in the Morning and drink
thereafter one Cup of Canary, or Rhenish Wine.

7. We did speak of Frictions: now we come to prescribe Ointments which are to
be used after the said Frictions: Take Oil of sweet Almonds, two ounces: Oil of
Cammomil, one ounce: mix them. This was often repeated, then the next soft
Ointment was used.

8. Take Oil of sweet Almonds, one ounce: Oyl-Olive, half an ounce: Ship-Pitch,
two ounces: with a sufficient quantity of Wax make an Ointment. By these
Remedies, but especially by that Ointment first described, this Youth grew well
to the wonder of many People.

9. Moreover these following Medicines are good against an Atropia. Take
Lineseed Oil, Oil of Worms, of each one ounce: Oil of Mace, two drams: Oil of
Hypericon, three drams: Salt Gem dried and levigated, one dram: Oil of Roses,
half an ounce: with a little Wax make a Liniment.

10. This following Medicine is also very good: Take the Pulp of the Wings and
fleshy Parts of a Capon, and of Partriges, of each six ounces: the Flesh of
Dates, two ounces: the Flesh of Jubebs, one ounce: Pine-Apples washed in Water
of Coltsfoot and Hysop, of each three drams: the seeds of Comfrey, and
Mallows, of each one dram: Liquorice scraped clean, half an ounce:
Tragacanthum, Gum Arabic, of each three scruples: sweet Almonds blanched,
three drams: beat them together according to Art: adding a sufficient quantity
of Sugar, as also the Syrup of Bugloss and Violets, a sufficient quantity: the
Powder of Species Resumptivae, one ounce and half: Electuarium de Gemmis, one
dram: mix them and make a Pasta Regalis, or Marchpane.

11. Take Syrup of Staechas, six ounces: the Powder of Species Aromatici
Rosati, one dram: mix them.

12. Tak Oil of sweet Almonds, Oil of Violets, Oil of Sesame, of each half an
ounce: Gum Tragacantha, Gum Arabic, of each one dram and half: the Powder of
Species Resumptivae, one dram, the Yelk of an Egg, with a little Wax: mix them
and make a Liniment. Petrus Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 97.

LXIV. The Palsy in a middle-aged Man.

1. A certain Gentleman of a robust strong constitution, about forty years of
age; for the most part in good Health, at length having accustomed himself to a
sedentary Life and Idleness, and thereby being made more dull, did hate all
kinds of Exercise and Recreation: Furthermore being melancholy and sad would
upon any light Occasion, yea sometimes for no manifest Cause break out into
Weeping and Tears.

2. This Man after a very little while (the like thing I have usually
observerved of others) was affected with a Weakness and Trembling of all the
Members, and afterward with the resolution of the lower Parts.

3. Yielding himself up to this Conqueror, and every Day more and more
sensibly languishing, he dyed within six Months.

4. I remember many others, especially two that had committed themselves to our
Cure, who in the former part of their Life and middle Age were very ingenious
and learned, but afterw^ds in their declinature and latter part of their Life;
growing very dull and forgetful partly from the ill disposition of the Body,
and partly from the perturbations of the Mind, became paralytick
notwithstanding all the Remedies that were used in the beginning of the Disease.

5. In such like Cases first of all the Brain seems, as to its disposition and
confirmation, to be corrupted and appaired, and the Spirits being carried out
of their proper Chanel, being also dull and heavy cannot rightly perform the
Acts of Imagination and Memory, therefore because of their Defects and
inordinate Motions, there must needs be an Impotency and Eclipse of the motive
Faculty in the nervous Appendix. Willis Pathelog. Cap. 9. Observe. 1.

LXV. The Palsy in a young Man.

1: A young Man of a sanguine Complexion, ingenious, and for the most part
healthful, sitting in his Chair after Supper, and too plentifully drinking
Wine, was taken with a Stupidity and Numbness in his right Hand; insomuch that
his Glove which he had in his Hand did fall involuntarily from him.

2. Afterward, rising out of the Chair and endeavoring to walk, he felt a
resolution in his Thigh and Leg of that Side; a little after he fell, yet
without any Apoplexy, into a certain Dullness and Hebitude of Mind with a kind
of Heaviness and Unsensibleness.

3. Nevertheless he remained in his right Wits, and could, when interrogated,
answer aptly enough, though but slowly and not without some Impediment, doing
also whatsoever was commanded him.

4. A learned Physician being brought, Phlebotomy, Vomits and Purgations were
celebrated in their order; Cupping-Glasses, Scarification, Liniments,
Frictions, and other Administrations were carefully exhibited; yet
notwithstanding the use of these Remedies the Palsy still grew worse.

5. Insomuch, that besides almost a total deprivation of Motion in the Members
of the right Side, he also lost the Sight of his right Eye; in this his
miserable Condition, though somnulent and numb, he knew his Friends, and was
conscious of his own Infirmity, and sollicitous for recovering his Health, and
did take all Remedies were tendered him.

6. But every Day more and more the animal Functions, and by consent from them
the vital did at length grow feeble and faint, so that about the seventh or
eight Day of his Sickness, he fell into a Delirium, and presently after into
Convulsions and other distractions of the animal Spirits, of which his Strength
being utterly destroyed, he dyed.

7. The Head being opened, the fore Cavities of the Brain were filled partly
with Ichorous-Blood, partly with Concrete and Grumous, as also with plenty of
the serous humor.

8. From whence it is easy to conceive that from that Illuvives compressing the
Corpus unum striatum, and shutting-up its Pores and the Passages; the Afflux of
the Spirits into the nervous Appendix of that Side is impeded; and so a
Resolution in the respective Members is excited.

9. As also because of the Thalamus Opticus where it is fixed to the Corpus
striatum being compressed, the Eye of that Side was deprived of Sight; moreover
the callous Body was a little compressed by the matter gathered together; from
hence the Principle of the animal Functions, their Slowness, Dullness and
Heaviness were excited without any subversion of them.

10. These kinds of Affections because of some Hurt affixed to the substance of
the Brain do proceed from thence, and not (as we in another place asserted)
from the Impletion of the Ventricles; which I do think is clear enough from
this one Instance. Willis Patholog. Cap. 9. Observe. 2.

LXVI. The Palsy in another middle-aged Man.

1. A Farmer who belonged to a certain noble Man, about the age of forty, his
Constitution was choleric and his Blood sharp, and not long since obnoxious to
a Vertigo, who while he was traveling a horseback through a certain Village;
was suddenly taken with a Scotomy, by which he fell presently to the Ground,
from whence being taken up by the Inhabitants and put into a Bed, he lay for
many hours insensible and as it were dead.

2. Afterward he was taken with an universal Palsy, and did feel all the
Members of both Sides resolved.

3. Coming to see him, I caused twelve ounces of Blood to be taken from him;
afterward I prescribed Medicines to be both internally and externally
administered, not without good Success.

4. For about five or six Days after he began to move his Hands and Feet, and
to extend and bow them here and there, yet slowly; and by a constant use of
Remedies he began within the space of two Months to raise himself up, to stand
on his Feet; and to walk a little with the Benefit of Crutches.

5. And then having used an artificial Bath sometimes at home; he grew every Day
stronger and more capable of motion, at length going to the Bath at the proper
Season, he was perfectly recovered, and by the use of these Waters in the space
of a fort-night; where he left his Crutches behind him.

6. In this Case the apopletick Matter falling from the Meditullium of the
Brain, being divided and largely diffused, had got into both the Corpus
striatum, and this caused an universal Palsy; but forasmuch, as the same was
expanded, it was with less Density impacted in the medullar Pores and
consequently more moveable and apt to be discussed and the Cure more facile and
sudden.

7. The hotter Sort of Medicines did not agree with this Man, therefore I
endeavored to exhibit such as were of their own nature temperate.

8. Now that the Palsy comes not only by cephalic Affects, but also by a
Colic and the Scurvy; the following Relation does evidently declare. Willis
Patholog. Cap. 9. Obs. 3.

LXVII. The Palsy in a young Woman after Childbirth.

1. A certain fair and young Woman after Childbirth fell into a tertian Ague;
which afterward became Quotidian; she having some Intermission of her Fever,
fell into a very feirce daily Cholick; the Pains first only in the Abdomen were
outrageous, being accompanied with Vomiting and most sharp Gripes.

2. She being for a long time afflicted with these and almost consumed, began
at length to be troubled with a kind of stupefaction and sense of pricking,
much like to that which one feels when the Hand or Foot is said to be asleep.

3. Not long after this a Palsy which was universal followed (of which Disease
the precedent Distemper is the usual Forerunner) in this helpless Condition
she was carried to Oxford and committed to the Care of another Doctor and my
self.

4. This poor young Woman's Arms, Legs, all the greater and lesser Members, were
so much resolved, that she could not so much as move Hand nor Foot, nor a
Finger of either Hand: Moreover she had so great a Consumption that there was
no Flesh to be seen on the Bones, and the Bones could scarcely stick to the
Skin; yet that which afforded us some small ground of hope was her good Pulse
and a lively Aspect.

5 After we had for many weeks exhibited several Medicines as well
antiscorbutick as antiparalytick, according to various Methods without Success,
we at length proposed to her and her Friends Salivation as a Remedy more
powerful but more dangerous then others.

6. Therefore we did exhibit a small Dose of Praecipitatum ex Mercurio cum
Sole, and did repeat the same the next Day; on the third Day a Salivation easy
and moderate was continued for a week without any malignant Symptoms, which did
succeed well.

7. Then the sick complaining of a grievous Head ach and Vertigo, began to be
afflicted with convulsive Motions; for that cause it was necessary immediately
to depress the Salivation, and to break off this Course as soon as possible, by
diverting and deriving the Defluxion of the serous humor from the Head toward
other Parts, which may be effected by the application of frequent Clysters,
epispastick Emplasters and Revulsions together with Cordials and Opiats
inwardly given.

8. By these things this noble Lady found her self a little better, and began
to extend and stretch-out the Joints of her Hands and Feet, and move the
Members from one place to another.

9. The Defluxion ceasing, she began to be gently purged for many Days with the
Decoction of China, Sarsa, Sanders, Ivory, etc. with the addition of the dried
Leaves of Sage, Betony, Pauls-Betony, etc. with which there was wont to be
mixed with the Spirit of Hartshorn or Soot, cephalic and cardiack
Confections, as also the proper Powder and Julap.

10. In the space of a Month she could stand on her Feet, being supported by
her Servants, and could walk a little in her Chamber, moreover sleeping and
eating indifferently well, she grew every Day in Strength and in Flesh; and at
last became perfectly well by the moderate use of the Baths.

11. The cause of this Distemper proceeded from the Blood, which being
corrupted and vitiated did bring an intermitting Fever, then because of the
said Fever, the Blood being more vitiated did communicate its Infection to the
Brain and the nervous Stock.

12. This peccant Matter being thus interlaced with the Blood and the nervous
Juice, first almost only spasmodick, and also chiefly entering into the
intercostal Nerves, did excite the Cholick; afterward being diffused more
largly into the Nerves of the Marrow of the Backbone, did cause painful
Contractions in the nervous Fibers through the whole Body.

13. And whereas by the daily abundant Incourse of the spasmodick Matter, the
Passages of the Brain and Nerves were very much opened, the thicker Particles
getting in at length, did disseminate a paralytick Disposition throughout the
whole Body.

14. About the Therapeia the usual Remedies of it before Salivation have been
less profitable, because they force the morbifick Matter so far that the
nervous Channels or Conduits are obstructed thereby; mercurial Particles as they
did dissolve the matter so compacted, did first of all open the way to a Cure,
which was every Day much advanced by cephalic Medicines, and was happily
consummated by using of the Baths. Willis Patholog. Cap. 9. Observe. 4

LXVIII. A Palsy which happened to a healthful Man.

1. But the use of the Baths is not profitable to all paralytick Persons; yea
to some they have been hurtful, as the following Relation will abundantly
manifest. A certain Merchant of London after he had put his Foot out of Joint,
did thereafter halt and was lame in that Part; yet otherwise was healthful and
strong enough, this Person finding no great Benefit by Topics of several
Sorts; he went to the Bath by advice of his Physician and began to make use of
the temperate Baths.

2. From the further use of which he would have forborne, being sensibly made
worse, the Palsy beginning immediately in the other Parts, but that a Physician
who was then present advised him, to continue the use of them, promising him
that he would be much the better: whereupon for the space of thirty of Days he
used the Baths, till all the lower Members from the Os Sacrum to the Feet were
altogether resolved.

3. Moreover in his Breast there was a notable Dyspnaea or straitness of
Breath, and a kind of Asthma excited, wherefore the Breath did labor under the
inforcement of those Parts and the agitation of the Thorax.

4. In the sad Case he departed from the Baths, now it was too late to think of
using other Medicines, for his Members were not only paralytical, but his Belly
swelled, and his Breathing was more and more difficult and impeded, his Pulse
became wonderful weak, for there was scarcely place left for Catharticks, only
cardiack and antiparalytick Remedies were to be made use of.

5. This sick Person notwithstanding the exhibition of these, within a
fort-night after laboring under a Dyspnaea for many hours, at length expired.

6. The cause of this Gentleman's Death I take to be the concretion of the Blood
in the Heart, for the long time the motion of the Praecordia was exceedingly
obstructed: it seems to me very profitable that pieces of Flesh did grow
together within the Ventricles of the Heart. Willis Patholog. Cap. 9. Observe. 5.

LXIX. A Palsy in a Child.

1. A Child about three years old, of a moist Brain, being sometimes obnoxious
to Inflammation in the Eyes and watery Wheals in the Face, was taken ill in the
beginning of the Fall, having a flow Fever, and a dejected Appetite, he grew
dull and drowsy; insomuch that almost Day and Night he slept continually.

2. This Child when he was wakned, he knew the By standers, and could answer
aptly when he was spoke to.

3. Proper Medicines were ehixbited, such as Clysters, Vesicatories,
Catharticks, also Juleps, Spirit of Hartshorn, Pouders, with many other Things
used in such a Case, all which being immediately and carefully exhibited, did
so much good that in the space of six or seven Days the sick Child was freed
from his Fever, and calling for Victuals grew so well that for that time he
stood not much in need of a Physician.

4. But within a very short while, he elapsed, becoming somnulent, was affected
with a more grievous Dullness and Heaviness than the former: insomuch that he
could be scarcely awakened, he knew nothing, nor did do any thing knowingly.

5. The next Day following he became stupid, and although he could open his
Eyes briskly and turn them here and there, yet he could not see any thing.

6. And within a Day or two thereafter he was seized with a Palsy of the right
Side, the former Remedies being repeated, there were added Sternutatoriess,
Apophlegmatisms, Blood-letting, Cataplasms to the Feet, and Epispasticks were
applied to the Head when shaved.

7. These and other Medicaments were prescribed but no happy Effect: For the
sick after he had lain four or five Days unsensible, both Pulse and Respiration
growing more and more feeble, he breathed out his Soul to God.

8. The Body being anatomized, all things were found sound in the lower and
middle Venture or Region, except that in the right Kidney the Ichorous humor
waxing white, had begun to gather together after the manner of some thin
Putrefaction, which did flow forth plentifully from some Parts of the
deffective and compressed Kidney.

9. This seemed to be beginning or Rudiment of a future Imposthumation and
perhaps because of the serous humor not gathering plentifully enough here, a
greater abundance had flowed to the Brain: For the hollowness of the Skull
being empty; the foremost Region of the Encephalon, even to the Insertion of
the fourth Sinus did swell, a clear lympid Water being through the Membrans
translucid; which did immediately overflow the Menings.

10. Moreover in that place, Portions of the Brain cut off as it were by
piecemeal, which were too much soaked and moistened, did appear almost without
the least reddish or sanguine Color.

11. In the hinder Part or Limbus of the Brain the Vessels were somewhat red,
and the substance of the Cortex was without any Tumor or overflowing of Water,
it appearing firmer; by this it appears that the cause of the Lethargy did
proceed from the watery Illuvies of the outmost Brain.

12. The Brain being cut away by peecemeal, and a Hole being made in the fore
Cavity distended by the Lympha, the c ear limpid Water being held-in within too
straight a Compass, breaks forth, the great abundance whereof had filled all
the Ventricles to the top; which ^y compressing the optic Thalami, (as we in
another Case related) and by entering into the Corpus Striatum and its Pores
causes a Blindness; and also by compression the Palsy.

13. The Plexus Choroeides did appear as they had been perboiled, waxing white
and without blood. It is probable by these things that all or the greatest part
of the Lympha of the vessels, has sent forth or dropped out that humor, which
has overflowed the Ventricles of the Brain.

14. Although in this case, if the watery Latex falling lower from the Cortex
of the Brain, the Brain being altogether pierced thorough; it may be demanded
whither it can flow down upon those sinus.

15. And it may not be improper to ask a reason why a Lethargick person appears
at first to be cured, and then immediately grows worse, having a blindness and
a Palsy: it is certainly from a store of the soporiferous matter falling from
the Cortex of the Brain into its Cavities, whereby the Animal function is a
little revived but afterward a new matter engendring in the Cortex of the
Brain, and this falling down into the sinus, is gathered and congregated to a
fullness.

16. And therefore it is that the person relapsed in the former Disease, with
these of blindness and the Palsy.

17: And although also the dropsy of the inmost Brain or the Inundation of its
Ventritricles either by compressing the Corpora striata or the Thalami Optici
causes a Palsy and blindness, or by vellicating the Original of the Nerves
stirs up the Spasmodick affections; yet the Lethargy does not arise from any
such cause, but from the exterior Brain is inundated and compressed. Willis
Patholog. cap. 9. Observe. 6.

LXX. The Palsy arising from a Cholick.

1. A certain Gentleman who had been long sickly, and often times sick indeed,
was troubled for almost five months with a Cholick, or rather a wandering Gout,
and a fierce and stubborn Scurvey; Insomuch that not only the Bowels and Loins
were afflicted with great torments, but moreover the whole Membrains and
Muscles were troubled with continual pungent and pricking Pains.

2. At length he endured most horrible Convulsions; one while resolutions of
the parts, now a Phrensy in the Head, then Appoplectick assaults, and
obfuscation of the sight; at length he Died, his strength being wasted, and the
treasury of the Spirits being exhausted.

3. Seven days; the penult being excepted, before his Death, he was more
vigorous both as to sense and intellect, yet live almost always without sleep;
and although Opiats, milder and stronger Medicines were exhibited, yet could he
scarcely sleep.

4. A little before he came to be watchful to that degree; a great quantity of
water did flow forth from a Vesicatory applied to the Neck, and did afterward
run every day till the day of his Death: from thence I suppose that the watery
humor being taken too copiously from the Brain, was the cause of his being so
little addicted to sleep and drouziness.

5. This Gentleman's Head being opened, the inward Cavities of the Brain, or all
the Ventricles were filled full of clear lympid water and they appeared as if
they were distended, yea about the top of the Backbone the very Furis
Medullaris seemed to be immerged in water that was gathered there.

6. Without doubt for this reason; Pains and fierce Convulsions in the Loins
and Members, yea in the whole Body were so troublesome; and because of the
overflowing in the Ventricles, he was obnoxious to frequent obfuscations of the
sight and resolution of the Joints.

7. Nevertheless from thence there was no Lethargy; but because of the water
too much derived from the Brain by Vesicatories, a great watchfullness was
occasioned.

8. He was afflicted with a Dropsy of the Breast because of the Lungs being much
vitiated; his Liver, which was very big, was every where full of white spots,
and almost without any blood; therefore the vices of the blood and Nervous part
ought in some measure to be attributed to these faults of the Viscera. Willis
Patholog. cap. 9. Observe. 7.

LXXI. A Palsy following upon a Fever.

1. A certain Youth had a Fever, with a Cough which ended in a Palsy of the
Tongue; first we gave him this Laxative syrup.

2. Tak^ syrup of Roses solutive, two ounces: Manna, half an ounce: a little of
the decoction of the flowers and fruits with the leaves of Sena.

3. After the Belly was loosened, we gave a sudorifick powder to be taken at
two several times, made of Hartshorn prepared, with the shreds of
Scarlet-Cloath, of each half a dram, in the water of Carduus Benedictus.

4. We gave him in the next place for his Cough, the roots of Sorrel, with
Hartshorn and Sugar Candy, and the syrup of the juice of Citrons, mixed with
syrup of Violets, also Conserve of Roses and Violets, and the like.

5. But we gave ease to his violent Cough by syrup of Jujubs, mixed with syrup
of Violets; and sometimes for Inspissating the Catarrh and defluxion, we gave
him in the Evening the syrup of the flowers of wild Poppie.

6. When by these things the principal Disease was defeated, there happened and
succeeded a Palsy of the Tongue, from which he was deprived of his speech, I
conjecture the cause of this proceeded from a Catarrh falling upon the Nerves
of the Tongue; for whom was prescribed the following Cephalic Balsam.

7. Take Oil of Nutmeg by expression, one dram: Oils of Bawm, Rue, Rosemary,
Marjoram, of each half a scruple: mix them and make a Balsam, wherewith anoint
frequently the Head, Temples, and Nostrills.

8. The following Gargarism was prescribed: Take the waters of Sage, and Lilly
Convally, of each six ounces: the spirit of black Cherries, one ounce and half:
Mithridate, one dram and half: mix them.

9. Outwardly was applied a bag of the seeds of Nigella, Mastich, Nutmeg, the
flowers of Lavender, Marjoram, and the like; by these things and the
observation of a good Diet this Youth gradually recovered strength. Gregorius
Horstius, lib. 1. Observe. 29.

LXXII. A Palsy following upon Cholick Pains.

1. One about fifty years of age had violent Pains of the Cholick, but when the
Intensness of the pain abated, there succeeded a great weekness of the Feet and
Hands, which ended in a Palsy of both, but chiefly of the Hands and Arms.

2. The Diet we prescribed for this person is such as is of an easy concoction,
and will rather keep the Belly lose than hard, such is the Broth of Hens,
wherein Prunes and Currants are put, Apples roasted with confected Anise and
Fennel, rear Eggs with fresh Butter, the flesh of Hens, Pullets, Pigeons, Veal
and Mutton, the Broth of these meats is to be aromatized, with a little
Rosemary, Time, Marjoram, Mace, Savory, Fennel, Anise, Caraway and the like:
your Wine must be old and your Beer new.

3. Then we appointed the following Clyster: Take Broth of Hens flesh, one
pound and half: the flowers of Cammomil, half an handful: Aniseed, Fennel-seed,
Cucumber-seeds, of each one dram: make a decoction, strain, then add the
Electuary of Hiera picra simplex, one ounce: Oil of Dill, Oil of Cammomil, of
each two ounces: Salt one dram: mix them. By the benefit of this the belly was
not only rendered loose, but the flatulency of the Inward parts was corrected.

4. After two days one dram of the powder of Mechoacan with four grains of the
Troches Alhandal was given hot in Wine of Raisons for a fuller purgation.

5. Or in the place of the powder you may take a Bolus: Take our Electuary of
Tamarinds, six drams: Pulvis De tribus Augustanorum, two scruples: mix them,
and take it fasting, a draught of the decoction of Pease is to be drunk
immediately after.

6. And in the intermediate days for making the Belly loose, a draught of the
Wine of Raisons warmed, with one ounce an a half of the Oil of bitter Almonds
will not be Inconvenient.

7. You may take these Medicaments for strengthening and comforting of the
Stomach; to wit, the roots of Succory, one handful, boil them in flesh broth,
with which you may mix eight or nine drops of the Spirit of Turpentine two
hours before Meat, but in the mean time, you must forbear the use of other
Medicines.

8. By the continuance of this proper means the Stomach will be strengthened,
Ventosities dissipated, and obstructions in the Mesentery prevented.

9. You may take half a dram of the following Stomach-pouder with white bread a
little toasted and moistened in Malago Wine: Take Coriander prepared half an
ounce: Anise and Fennel-seeds, of each one dram: Hartshorn prepared,
Citron-peels, of each half a dram: Sugar half an ounce: make a powder.

10. The quantity of half a scruple of Mithridate and old Treacle taken in the
Morning, will contribute much to the strengthening of the Head, as also
Marjoram-water, after other evacuations attracted and drawn up the Nostrills;
the seed of Nigella prepared with Vinegar, and put up in a Nodul, will derive
defluxions from the Head to the Nostrils, outwardly let the top of the Head be
anointed frequently with the Balsam of Amber.

11. These being continued for a month, we think because of the affect of the
Feet and Hands, that baths for Sweating will be convenient, to wit, Of the
leaves of Sage, Rosemary, Rue, Origanum, Time, Camomil, and the like, of each
three handfuls: Bay Berries, one handful: Juniper Berries, four handfuls: make
a Decoction.

12. After this sweating Bath, let sweating be provoked in Bed, that being
done, the Backbone, Shoulder blades with the extreme parts are to be anointed
with the following Liniment, which is as follows.

13. Take the fat or grease of a Badger, of a Fox, of a Duck, of a Goose, of
each one ounce: Oil of Wormwood, of Cammomil, of Rue, of each half an ounce:
Bay Berries, Juniper Berries, of each two drams: the flowers of Camomil, of
Sage, of each one handful: of generous Wine, three ounces: make a sufficient
quantity of a decoction strain it by expression for a Liniment. This Person
grew well and recovered h^s strength by degrees by the use of these things.

14. Among other things we did exhibit what Crato speaks of in his counsels
172. Take Gum Galbanum, Gum Elemi, Gum of Jvy, the Oil of Bays, or of Juniper,
of each an equal part, make a distillation; from whence will Issue a water,
then a clear and thickish sort of Oil like unto Honey, which is mightily
commended as a good Balsam.

15. Outwardly, after the aforesaid bathings, the Spirit of Tartar frequently
applied by way of friction, in anointing is good for resolving and attenuating
the peccant matter in the musculous Parts. Gregorius Horstius, lib. 2. Observe.
16.

LXXIII. A Palsy of the right side, accompanied with some defects and
Impairment of the Intellect and Speech.

1. A Youth about the age of twelve was taken with a Palsy of one side, by
which he was not only deprived of perfect Ratiocination, but also of Articulate
Speech, together with a contorsion of his right Foot.

2. I did resolve first of all to evacuate the Phlegm and Serous humors, to help
concoction, and to strengthen the Brain and the Marrow of the Backbone,
wherefore I prescribed this following purging powder.

3. Take roots of Peony, half a scruple: Cream of Tartar, one scruple and half:
species Diaturbeth, with Rhubarb, one scruple: Diagridium, with Oil of Fennel
prepared, half a scruple: Aniseed and Coriander-seed prepared, of each one
scruple: mix and make a Powder, to be divided into two parts, we allowed him
the use of this on intermediate days.

4. Twice to be taken for purgation of the whole Body; we perscribed the
following preparation: the manner of taking it alternately: Take roots of
Peony, half a scruple, species Diaturbeth with Rhubarb, Cream of Tartar, of
each one scruple and half: Diagrydium with Oil of Fennel prepared, six grains:
mix and make a powder to be divided into two equal parts.

5. Secondly, for helping of concoction; we appoint that such things as are
proper for the Head, be taken; wherefore we prescribed the following powder to
be daily taken with his meat as a pickle or seasoning.

6. Take roots of Peony, half a dram: the leaves of Sage, Rue, Betony, Time, of
each one handful: the flowers of Lavender, of Rosemary, half an handful: the
seeds of Fennel, and Peony hul'd, of each two drams: Mace macerated with
Vinegar and dried, one dram: Nutmeg, Cinnamon, of each half a dram: make a fine
powder by sifting: half a dram whereof is to be taken both at Dinner and
Supper, you must mix it with the Meat you eat.

7. Your daily drink must be of the decoction of Sassafras, with the roots of
Peony, Elecampane and Avens, etc.

8. Thirdly, to wit, for the strengthening of the Head and the Nervous kind we
prescribed the following things: Inwardly by turns let him use the
corroborative powder with the appropriated distilled water and Cephalic Rowls.

9. Outwardly, we ordered that the Marrow of the Backbone and the parts that
are hurt be rubbed and fomented with the aforesaid distillation, all which
being continued for the space of six months; not only the defect of his reason,
but of his Speech was helped, and the Child restored to his prist in vigor, no
more complaining of his sudden fits, this being the second year from the first
assault of his Disease.

10. Here follows the forms of the forenamed remedies: Take the roots of
Angelica, of Peony, of each one ounce and half: Orris, Gentian, long Cypress,
of each six drams: the leaves of Marjoram, of the greater Sage, Germander,
Betony, of each two handfuls: the flowers of Lavender, of Cammomil, of
Staechas, of each one pugil and half: Nutmegs, Cloves, Cubebs, of each one dram
and half: cut and bruise them and then infuse them in two quarts of Malago, let
them stand in a hot place for three days and make a distillation in Balneo.

11. The strengthening powder: Take roots of Peony, Misleto of the Oak, of each
one scruple and half: the leaves of Sage and Betony, of each half an handful:
the seeds of Peony, half a dram: Coriander prepared one dram: Man's skull
prepared one scruple: Mace, Cloves, of each half a scruple: Hearts horn
prepared, one dram and half: Sugar, half an ounce: make a powder.

12. A comfortable Water to be taken with the foregoing Powder: Take black
Cherry-Water, one ounce and half: Waters of the Flowers of Tile, of Borrage, of
each three ounces: of Sorrel, six ounces: Lozenges of Sugar pearled, one ounce
and half: mix them.

13. Sometimes in place of the aforesaid Powder the following was taken by him:
Take Powder of Mastick, one dram and half: Hartshorn burnt and prepared, red
Coral prepared, of each half a dram: Sugar of Roses tabulated, half an ounce:
mix them and make a Powder.

14. Cephalic Rowls: Take Spirits of Diamoschi Dulcis, of Diambrae, of each
one dram and half: Oil of Nutmeg by Expression, half a scruple: Fennel, four
drops: Amber, three drops: Sugar dissolved in Lavender-Water, six ounces: make
a Confection in Rowls.

15. A Liniment for the Backbone. Take Oils of Castoreum, of Worms, of Rue, of
each one ounce and half: Fennel distilled, half a scruple: Vnguentum Nervinum,
six drams: mix them for a Liniment. Gregorius Horstius, Tom. 2. Lib. 2. Observe.
41.

LXXIV. A Palsy of the left Side from an approaching Apoplexy.

1. A certain Gentleman about the age of seventy by his natural Constitution,
Sanguine, was suddenly afflicted with a dreadful Shivering over his whole Body,
with a Resolution of his left Side, and a Diminution of his animal Powers, the
operation of his Intellect remaining as yet with him, though he could not
express himself because of the Impediment of his Speech.

2. Now although there was but little hopes of his perfect and total Recovery
by reason of his great age, yet we despaired not but that the grief might be
averted from the more remote Parts so long as Nature continued strong.

3, First of all after the rigorous Coldness the external Parts growing hot, we
thought it necessary to provoke Sweating, by exhibiting eight grains of the
Bezoar stone with a sufficient quantity of Fumitary and S^ge-Water, which being
done, and a convenient Repose following thereupon, the Day after for the sake
of a greater Revulsion, we ordered that a sharp Clyster be injected.

4. And lest it should operate slowly, we stimulated Nature with a Suppository,
and as the Gentleman was acustomed to take, so we give him one ounce and half
of Conserve of Roses dissolved in Broth for a greater Laxation.

5. By which at length, the retained hard Excrements were evacuated, and the
rest was committed for that time to Nature; except that in the Evening we did
anoint the Nape and Backbone, with the Oils of Juniper, Turpentine, Lavender,
etc.

6. And we gave him a spoonful or two of the apoplectick Water, upon which
followed a more easy Night and a more refreshing Sleep.

7. After a while his Abdomen being filled full of Wind, and his Urine coming
involuntarily from him; we again gave him another Clyster, whose Operation was
more successful than the former.

8. Secondly, we had Respect to the more special Indications: as first the hot
Intemperature of the Liver, transmitting more than usual Vap^urs to the
debilitated Brain; secondly, that the Matter afflicting the Brain may be
repelled; thirdly, that the Head and the Marrow of the Backbone be strengthened.

9. As to the first, we must prevent the Obstruction of the Belly; which may be
done by Conserve of Roses and the frequent use of the Decoction of
Cichory-roots with Raisons, Conserve of the roots of Cichory, Spirit of
Vitriol, with Cock-broth, Cream of Tartar with Ptisan, etc.

10. For the second, to wit, the Revulsion of the peccant Matter, we judge
Blood letting will be convenient, the Moon being in Aquarius; as also frequent
Frictions of the extreme Parts, Ligatures, and usual Scarifications, likewise a
Vesicatory to the Nape of the Neck.

11. I do not disapprove of the Decoction of China-root, as it will afterward
appear.

12. Thirdly, we think the following Powder convenient for the Head: Take
Species Diarrhodon Abbatis, one dram: Ambergrise, half a dram: Magistry of
Coral and Pearl, of each one scruple: Emeralds levigated, half a scruple:
Lozenges of Sugar pearled, half an ounce: mix and make a Powder: of which the
Person is to take half a dram in some proper and fit Water.

13. In the place of this it will not be inconvenient sometimes for change to
use the following Rowls: Take Oil of Nutmeg by Expression, one scruple and
half: Species Diambrae, Species Diamoschi Dulcis, of each one ounce: white
Amber prepared, half a dram: Sugar dissolved in Lavender Water five ounces:
make a Confection in Rowls.

14. Outwardly, for anointing the Neck and Backbone and the paralytick Parts,
make use of this following Distillation: Take the roots of Angelica, Orrice,
long Cypress, Asarum, of each one onnce: the leaves of Sage, the greater
Germander, Gout-Ivy, Lavender, Rosemary, Betony, of each one handful: the
Flowers of Cammomil, of Lilly Convally, of the Tile-Tree, of Rosemary,
Staechas, of each half an handful: Nutmeg, Cloves, Mace, of each two drams: cut
and bruise them, and then infuse them in a sufficient quantity of good
Malago-Wine, let them stand in some convenient warm place for four Days,
afterward distill them in Balneo maris; then rub the abovenamed Parts with the
distilled Liquor, and sometimes in the Morning a spoonful and half of the same
Liquor may be taken.

15 By the Administration of these Things for a week or two he was somewhat
recovered; but the Blood (as appeared by opening of a Vein) being disposed to
Putrefaction, I looked upon as a sign of the Defect of native Heat.

16. Wherefore besides these Remedies already mentioned, there was prescribed
for strengthing the Concoction, the Elixir Proprietatis Paracelsi; some drops
whereof were to be often taken, as also Oxymel of Squills mixed with a little
Mithridate and diluted with Sage-Water, and the like.

17. And we did apply the following Emplaster to the Crown of the Head, which
needed not to be first shaved, because it was bald! Take Myrrh, Electuary of
Storax Calamita, Bdellium, Benjamin, Labdanum, of each half an ounce: Gum
Juniper, Vernix, of each two drams: Mans-skull prepared, two drams and half:
Lapis Lazuli, half a scruple: with liquid Styrax, make a Mass for an Emplaster
for the Neck.

18. Also the following Emplaster was prescribed for the Neck: Take Oil of
Euphorbium, of Castoreum, of Rue, of Bays, of each one scruple: Castoreum, long
Pepper, Pyrethrum, of each one dram: Rocket seed, Cresses, Zedoary, of each one
dram and half: Juniper, and Bay Berries, of each one dram: Sagapine, Opopa^ax,
Galbanum, Euphorbium, of each half a dram: Aqua Aurea Langii, with a little Was
and Rosin make a plaster.

19. By these Medicines this most grievous afflicting distemper was so much
abated, that by little and little he came to the free use of his Speech, and in
the spring of the year he was very well; only the Palsy of the left Side
remained.

20. After a while I was called again; and I thought it necessary to have
respect; First, to the cause of the defluxion; Secondly, to dissipate the same;
Thirdly, to strengthen the Paralytick parts.

21. As to the first let the superfluities of the Belly be evacuated by the use
of Clysters and Sugar of Roses.

22. The roots of Succory in conserve, in Physical Vinegar, and in decoction
does qualify the Intemperature of the Liver; concoction is strengthened by the
use of a convenient Tragaea.

23. Let the food be such as is easy of digestion; and let your drink be Wine
moderately taken, wherein put Sage, Rosemary, Betony, and Ambergrise.

24. Secondly, as to the dissipating and removing of the defluxion: Take the
decoction of the roots of China and Sassafras for at least 15 days, fasting,
either alone or with the Bezoar-stone.

25. As to the third cause, let these things aforeprescribed be often repeated,
to which add a fresh distillation of Lilly Convally prepared after this manner.

26. Take the flowers of Lilly-Convally, nine handfuls: choice wine, four
quarts: let them stand and digest for eight days, to which add the flowers of
Lavender dried, the tops of Rosemary, of each one handful: Nutmegs, Cubebs, of
each one dram: Misleto of the Oak, and Castoreum, of each half a dram: let them
again digest in some warm place, and then distill in Balneo Maris.

27. This Gentleman was for a while pretty well recovered, and could go abroad,
but at length falling into a sudden fit of the Apoplexy, this good old
Gentleman paid his debt to nature, in the seventy fifth year of his age.
Gregorius Horstius, Tom. 2. lib. 2. cap. 43.

LXXV. A Palsy upon a Cholick.

1. A certain Woman of a choleric constitution, abounding in crudities by
reason of the obstruction of her monthly Terms; suffered a great pain in her
Belly; she was bound in her Belly; and troubled with flatulencies; she did
covet eating, and had a bad digestion, accompanied with vomiting and nauseating.

2. At length for some weeks she was grievously afflicted with great pains in
the external parts, to wit, her Hands and Feet, her urin was red and thick; she
had an Imbecility and inhability both to sense and motion, with a pungent and
burning kind of pain; insomuch that she altogether appeared Paralytick.

3. In the cure of this person we had respect to two things, first her vehement
continued pain of the Cholick, and then the following Palsy, improperly so
called, being nothing else but the decayed and weak constitution of the Muscles
of the Hands and Feet.

4. The Belly because of her Cholick, was to be loosened and the peccant matter
must be attenuated, resolved and evacuated and the intestines strengthened, for
which inwardly Clysters were to be applied made of the docoction of the roots
Marshmallows and Mallows, Mercury, Cammomil, Paul's Betony, and the like; there
was added Hiera picra Simplex, Benedictum Laxativum with the Oil of Chamomil
and Rue, etc.

5. Outwardly the caul or Suet of a weather, wherein the Bowels are lapt, being
made hot in a Kettle were applied, as also with other moistening Ointments,
chiefly that which is made of the Oil of Cammomil, white Lillies, the fat of a
Hen and the Marrow of a leg of Veal.

6. We endeavored to loosen the Belly, and for attenuating and resolving the
peccant matter we used the decoction of the opening roots, Cammomil, Paul's
Betony, and the like, with the syrup of the five roots, some drops of the Oil
of Salt being added.

7. As also the following evacuation by the Pills of Labdanum: Take Labdanum,
half an ounce: Mastich, one dram: let them be made warm in a Mortar, and being
dissolved add Troches of Alhandal, three drams: Electuary of the juice of
Roses, half an ounce: syrup of Roses solutive a sufficient quantity, make a
mass, dose from one scruple to one dram.

8. For strengthening, confected Ginger is good and Malaga Sack, with white
Bread, as also Aromaticum Rosatum, mixed with conserve of Borage and Rosemary
flowers, etc.

9. As to the subsequent Palsy it is necessary that we provide for preventing
the nutritive cause; here we approve of Crato's counsel for strengthening the
Intestines, who orders the Navel to be anointed with the distilled Oil of
Galbanum confected.

10. Also after the Belly is mollified he would have this following powder to
be frequently made use of: Take tender Hartshorn, Myrrh, of each one dram:
white Pepper, half a dram: make a confect: which take in a glass of Wine.

11. But in respect of the Paralytick affect it self, the Hands and Feet were
washed frequently with the decoction of Nettle-roots, the leaves of Rosemary,
Gout-Jvy, Origanum, etc.

12. Afterward they were anointed with this kind of Liniment: Tak the fat of a
Badger, the fat of a Fox, and the fat of a Stork, of each half an ounce: the
juice of Sage, of Wormwood, of each two drams: the Oil of Bays, one ounce: mix
them and make an Ointment, Gregorius Horstius, Tom. 2. lib. 4. cap. 13.

LXXVI. The cure of the Palsy.

1. Purgations and Sweats being taken, the Intention is to be directed to three
sorts of Liniments, to wit, that which is mild, that which is in a mediocrity,
and that which is strong.

2. In the beginning let the Members be gently stroked and anointed for eight
or ten Days with the Oil of sweet Almonds, Woman's Milk, and the Ma row of
Calfs-Feet.

3. Afterward for so many Days again let them be anointed with wild
Cats-Grease, and a little Castoreum; or the Oil of Castoreum, with a little
Mucilage and Lin-seed.

4. Lastly, anoint with an Ointment made of the Fat of an Eel, which lies in
its Belly, and also drops while it is roasting; mixed with the Fat of a Fox,
and Oil of Lin-seed, of each an equal part: Earthworms, half a part: These
being shaken together or wrought with Oil, let be boiled in a little Wine over
a gentle Fire to a consumption thereof; until a drop thereof cast upon the
Coals makes no Crackling.

5. But if it should happen, that at once these Parts notwithstanding their
being anointed should not be freed from the Palsy; after the space of a Month
you may repeat the same medicinal Ointments again, or by consent of your
Physician repair to the Baths. Gregorius Horstius, Tom. 2. Lib. 8. Cap. 8.

LXXVII. A Palsy and Pissing of Blood upon the suppression of the Hemorrhoids.

1. A certain noble Person had the Hemorrhoids for many years every Month,
without any inconveniency, yea rather with great Advantage, but in the
beginning of the Year and about the seventieth year of his age, they stopped.

2. From thence a certain Weariness and Heaviness of his whole Body seized him,
and after two Months he pissed pure Blood without Pain for the space of three
Days.

3. His Body being gently purged, the Pissing of Blood did spontaneously cease,
as also the Weariness of his Body.

4. Not long after looking out of his Window after Dinner, upon the Course of
the River Broia and upon the Circumvolution of the Wheels of a Mill, sell
immediately upon the Ground, having both a Pain in his Head and the Vertigo,
and was taken with a Palsy of the left Side.

5. I and another Physician did institute a Cure to this Person under those sad
Circumstances; we presently ordered this following Draught.

6. Take choice Treacle, one dram: Cinnamon Water distilled without Wine, two
ounces: mix and make a Potion.

7. Thereafter we did anoint the Side affected and the Backbone with this
Ointment: Take the Oils of Cammomil, of Worms, of Roses, of each one ounce: mix
them.

8. He did not eat any Supper that Evening; and the following Night, which was
somewhat bad, he did sweat well.

9. The next Day a moderate Clyster being first exhibited, we did apply Leeches
to the Hemorrhoide Veins, whereby six or seven ounces of Blood were extracted.

10. Then the Day after he took the following Potion: Take the Flowers and
Leaves of Betony, Sage, and Rosemary, of each half an handful: Anise-seeds, and
the Leaves of Sena cleansed, of each two drams: let them boil in a sufficient
quantity of Water; till the strained Liquor come to four ounces, in which
dissolve the Electuary of Diaphanicon, with Rhubarb and Diacatholicon, of each
one dram: Syrup of Roses solutive, one ounce: mix them and make a Potion, by
which he was gently purged six or seven times.

11. The whole left Side which was affected, was every Day twice anointed with
the preceding Liniment; the Body being purged, the following Apozem was used.

12. Take the roots of Fennel, of Parsley, of Polypody of the Oak, of each one
dram: the Flowers and Leaves of Betony, Primrose, the tops of Marjoram, of each
one handful: Anise and Fennel-seeds, of each two drams: Liquorice scraped, one
ounce: boil them in Water till the strained Liquor come to one pound, in which
dissolve Syrup of Betony, two ounces: Sugar and clarified Honey, so much as is
convenient to sweeten it: exhibit it four Mornings with Tablets of Diarrhodon
Abbatis.

13. This Apozem being taken; the following Pills were used: Take mass Pil.
Cochiae, and Pil. Aggregativae, of each half an dram: with Syrup of Betony,
form seven Pills, and then wrap them in the Powder of Cinnamon.

14. In the mean time the whole Side was anointed twice every Day with the
abovenamed Liniment made very warm.

15. The Pills being taken we prescribed another Liniment to be made use of
twice every day. Take the Oil of Earth Worms, the Oil of Foxes, the Oil of
Costus, of each one ounce: the Oil of Juniper Berries, two dram: Aqua Vitae,
one dram: mix them and make a Liniment.

16. These Remedies thus prescribed he used, and having for the space of ten
Days thereafter taken no Medicine; we ordered for him the following Pills. Take
Pil. Cochiae and Pil. Hermodact. of each one scruple: Pil. Agarick, one scruple
and half: with syrup of Roses solutive form 7 Pills and roll them in the Powder
of Cinnamon.

17. For strengthening of the noble Members this following Electuary was used:
Take the Conserves of the Flowers of Betony, Sage, Primroses, Rosemary,
Marjoram, of each half an ounce: Species Aromatici Rosati, one dram and half:
choice Cinnamon, one dram: with the Syrup of the Conserve of Citron-Peels, make
an Electuary: of which every Day, three hours before Dinner he did take the
bigness of a Chest-nut.

18. From the very beginning of his Disease he observed a good Diet; he did
abstain from Wine altogther for the space of twenty Days, but in the place
thereof he used Hydromel, in which the Flowers of Betony, Sage, Primroses,
Agrimony, and Pauls-Betony were boiled.

19. By these Remedies through the divine Favor he was freed from the Palsy,
and continued afterward for many years in good Health, even to his decrepid
age; and then died. Fabritius Hildanus, Cent. 2. Observe. 11.

LXXVIII. A Palsy degenerating into a Lethargy.

1. A noble Person about sixty years of age of my Acquaintance, being afflicted
with a Palsy in the Legs; did use according to prescription a Bath of hot
Leaves and Flowers; as Betony, Primroses, Rosemary, Sage, Marjoram, Lavender,
Bay Leaves, Gout-Ivy, Origanum, Juniper Berries, and the like boiled in Wine.

2. Having used these for some time, he fell at length into a Lethargy; in
which he quietly began his everlasting Sleep. Fabritius-Hildanus, Cent. 5. Cap.
6.

LXXIX. A Palsy cured in several Persons.

1. A certain worthy Matron being afflicted with an inveterate Headache and
Scotomy, having applied Cupping-Glasses while her Body was foul and not
expurgated, did not long after fall into a Palsy of the Arms.

2. I being called to Consultation of her Cure, ordered her Body to be decently
purged, and prescribed Masticatories and Sudorificks.

3. Afterward I sent her to the Baths of Valesia, and she recovered again,
though not without great Expenses and Trouble.

4. Another Person, by Occupation a Potter, being afflicted with a Pain in the
Head and Scotomy, was also taken with a Palsy after the application of
Cupping-Glasses: But having visited many Baths, though all in vain, he at
length was forced to pay his Debt to Nature.

5. This Man having from his Youth been much employed in this his Trade, which
requires that the Hands be often in cold Water and Clay, the nervous Parts were
so debilitated and the native Heat so weakened, that though the best Medicines
were applied yet they could not overcome the Disease.

6. Let young Students then learn, that universal Remedies are to be preferred
before Topics. Fabritius Hildanus, Cent. 5. Cap. 71.

LXXX. A Palsy.

1. The Baths of Hirschberg will do good, if the Body be first purged with the
following Pills. Take Pil. de Sarcocolla, Pil. Aureae, and Cochiae, of each one
scruple: with Betony-Water make seventeen Pills.

2. If the Belly be bound, whilst you use the Baths, take the bigness of a
Chest-nut of the following Electuary about three hours before Meat.

3. Take fat Figs pulp'd through a Sieve, four ounces: the seeds of Carthamus
hul'd, one ounce: Species Diaphaenicon, half an ounce: Cloves, two drams: with
Syrup of Roses laxitive make an Electuary.

4. For strengthening of the Bowels and Joints you may eat four of the
following Rowls, two hours before Dinner: Take Species Rosatae Novellae,
Aromaticum Rosatum, of each two drams and half: Peony-seeds, three scruples and
half: fine Sugar dissolved in Bawm-Water, a sufficient quantity: make a
Confection in Rowls.

5. Let the Neck and the Joints of the Arms be every day bathed with the
following Ointment warm: Take Vnguentum Martiatum, Aragon, of each one ounce,
Oil of Foxes, of Pepper, of Euphorbium, of each half an ounce: Hares-Fat, one
ounce: Malago, two ounces: mix them and boil them to the consumption of the
Wine, and make an Ointment. Abrah. Seylerus apud Scholtzium, Cons. Med. 49.

LXXXI. The Palsy.

1. The use of Cupping-glasses in this Disease is necessary, which I would have
applied in both parts to the Backbone. Aetius commends the use of Castoreum in
this Disease, but his dose of half an ounce, I think is too great.

2. Conserves of Germander, Acorus, Rosemary flowers, Bawm, are of good use.

3. Many Topics may be applied to the Backbone, but an Ointment of Badgers
grease and the Oil of Nutmegs is the best and fittest Medicine; afterward
there was applied to the Backbone an Emplaster made of the Powder of Galangal,
Calamus Aromaticus, and mixed with the Powder of Earthworms, being inspissated
over a slow fire with Honey.

4. I would not have omitted the use of Grana pini: in drink I approve of
Muscadel, either with Sage or Rosemary: but if these Herbs should offend,
Goose-grass is commended. Crato, cons. med. 48. apud Scholtzium.

LXXXII. The Palsy in a Noble Man.

1. All Physicians agree that this Disease is difficult to Cure, especially if
that part which is whole abound in heat, and that part which is infirm and
grieved be very cold.

2. Some of the modern Physicians are of opinion that a Palsy in old People is
almost Incurable, if the Relaxations be more than annual.

3. Avicenna says, If the languishing Member loses not its heat and is not
made less, then a recovery is not to be dispaired of: And because all kind of
Diseases are to be cured by contrary Medicines; care must be had that the same
be qualifyed and moderated according to the strength of the Sick.

4. It is necessary by powerful Medicines to open, to evacuate, to dry and to
warm.

5. These which are found and included in the efficient causes, are divided in
these three, the six nonnatural things, the exhibition of Medicines, and the
action of the Hands.

6. The Diet which is proper, is such as has a Tendency to warm and dry, the
Air must be endowed with the same qualities; and if the Climate you live in
afford you not that benefit, you must repair to the place where it must be had.

7. Mountanous places and Lakes are to be shuned; but if the Air be extreme
cold, it may be corrected with Fires of dry Wood, and Clothes made of skins or
furred.

8. You are to correct the badness of the Air, by dried Marjoram, Staechas,
Bays, Time, Rue Origanum, Hysop, and such like; there are some who commend the
fumes of Musk, Amber and the wood of Aloes.

9. Aegenita prescribes that the sick be carried, to Maritime places, although
Avicenna says that moist exhalations are excited and drawn up in the firmament
from the next Sea.

10. Cold no doubt is an Enemy to the Nerves, the Brain and Marrow of the
Backbone.

11. As to Meat and Drink, they must be both moderate, all Physicians almost
condemn the use of Wine, and advise the drinking of water wherein Honey has
been put, to which I think may be added a little Cinnamon, it may be also
qualified with the wine of sweet Pomegranates.

12. Let his Bread be choice and well fermented, sometimes Biscuit may be used;
let his Meat be for the most part roasted.

13. Young Cocks who have never trod a Hen are mightily commended, and Fowls
that keep in Mountanous places, being seasoned with Pepper, Cinnamon, and such
like things.

14. Season also the Eggs you eat with Pepper and Cinnamon, but they must not
be too much boiled, and the Yolks are only to be eaten.

15. Milk and things made of Milk, Fishes all kind of Pease and fruits are
condemned; the fruits of the Pine tree, if moderately taken are commended, and
are very proper for Paralytick persons.

16. A pickle or seasoning with Sage, Mint, Time, Pepper, Cinnamon and Cloves
tempered and mixed with the Wine of Pomgranats; is approved of.

17. Beware of day sleeping, and of sleeping immediately after meat.

18. The Belly must be always kept in good tune: if nature be stubborn,
Clysters must be prepared of the decoction of Figs dried Centuary the les^,
having its flower, but not its root (as some would have) Dill, Fennel, Beets,
one ounce of Hiera picra, Oil of Dill, the Yolk of an Eg and Salt being added.

19. The use of Venus is hurtful; yet motion warms and attenuates; an Author
says, that vehement wrath and passion did restore one that was Paralytick to
his Health, to wit, Titus the Son of Vespasian.

20. Deep and serious thoughts as also Melancholy does hurt extremely.

21. According to Avicenna the administration of Medicines and the Method of
Cure ought to be otherwise in the beginning of the Cure, than it is in the
progress; and so on the contrary.

22. For about a fortnight Clysters are to be used and easy Medicines, then we
must proceed to more efficacious Remedies.

23. Now as to the present cause, (For it appears that this is the third or
fourth year of this Disease,) I judge it necessary that powerful and
efficacious Medicines be often made use of and repeated, whereby the humors
might be concocted and often evacuated either by stool or vomit.

24. After two or three purges are taken, of which any of them shall endure
about fifteen days more or less; let them be afterward exhibited fifteen or
twenty or forty days more.

25. Sudorificks are convenient.

26. Outwardly let there be exhibited some remedies, such as Emplasters,
Artifical waters, Masticatories, Gargarisms, Ointments, Perfumes, Errhines,
Frictions, Ligatures, Cupping-glasses, Vesicatories, shaving of the Head,
Cauteries.

27. Blood-letting, if at all, it should be done in the beginning of the Disease.

28. I do not disapprove of what a late Author writes, that in long chronick
Diseases there should be ten days of Intermission of the use of Medicines.

29. But if the sick, notwithstanding all evacuations and nutritive Medicines,
be nothing the better, the same must be repeated again, concoctions,
Evacuations, things aleviating and comforting.

30. And lastly, dry Baths must be used, or natural Sulphur, Alum and Nitrous
Baths.

31. For a digestive the syrup of Staechas is proper, Oxymel of Squills, Oxymel
compound, and the like.

32. Let a decoction be made of Sage, Rue, Ground Pine, Cowslips, Daisies,
Hysop, Time, Origanum, Pyrethrum, Carduus Sanctus, Betony, Asarabacca, the wild
black Vine or Briony, Bugloss, the root of Masterwort, and the like.

33. Things fit for evacuating are Pills made of Euphorbium, Pilulae faetidae
Majores, Pilulae Hermetis, with Troches of Colocynthis, and the like.

34. Vomit may be provoked with four ounces of the decoction of Radish seeds:
three ounces of Oxymel simple being added.

35. This may be rendered more efficacious this way; let the Radish be pierced
through; in the holes put a piece of white Hellebor; then dig up some part of
the Earth, and lay it there for some days; which being done, throw away the
Hellebor, and wash, and bruise the radish, and let the sick take the juice
thereof.

36. Treacle and Mithridate does comfort, the quantity of a dram and no more
may be taken once every day, but at diverse hours and very cautiously.

37. Sagapenum or Opopanax or assa Faetida are of powerful virtues for this
purpose, according to the received opinion of some learned Men.

38. Some have cured the Palsy by exhibiting Hiera gilded, Pepper gilded being
also added; others by exhibiting every Night gilded Castoreum, and gilded
Pepper.

39. There are some who give two drams of the confection of Anacardina, which
suddenly provokes Sweat and brings a Fever; which I have here inserted,
because I have found it prescribed by experienced Physicians, though by me it
is scarsly allowable.

40. One of the Modern Physicians does greatly approve of this following
Electuary; if half an ounce thereof be taken thrice a day, that is to say,
three hours before Dinner, two before Supper, and when the person goes to Bed.

41. Take the Brains of a Hare fried in a Drying Pan, one pound: the juice of
Sage, the roots of Acorus, of each three drams: Cinnamon, Cloves, Pepper, of
each half a dram: Turpentine washed in water of Ground Pine, three ounces:
Sugar dissolved in Ground-Pine-water a sufficient quantity; make an Electuary.

42. Another thing he advises, after evacuations to make use of dry Baths;
after which he orders the taking of Treacle for many days.

43. Another advised (which I take to be very proper for the purpose) that when
they come out of the Bath the Neck be rubbed and the marrow of the Backbone
either with fresh Orrice root cut, or the root of the Lilly, until the part be
red with rubbing; then let it be fomented with a long Sponge, according to the
length of the Backbone.

44. Dip the Sponge in the following decoction: Take the flowers of Cammomil,
Ivy, Sage, Staechas, Marjoram, Cowslips, Calamint, of each five pound: white
Wine, four pound: sharp Vinegar, one pound: let them boil: which fomentation
may be made use of twice a day, according to the strength of the sick.

45. A dry Bath may be also made of the like things; likewise bags may be made
of the same things according to the length of the Spinal Marrow.

46. After fomentation of the Backbone, anoint the same with the following
Ointment: Take the Oil of Euphorbium, Pepper, Oil of Foxes, of each one ounce:
Mastich, Savin, the Cypress Nut, of each one dram: and Wax a sufficient
quantity make an Ointment, with which Ointment the parts hurt may be anointed.

47. For the same use is the following Ointment; by others very much commended:
Take Sagapenum, Opopanax, Bdellium, Euphorbium, Mastich, of each five drams:
Oil of Turpentine, Oil of Bays, of each two ounces: let the Gum be dissolved in
the Wine and make an Ointment.

48. Several Physicians are of the opinion that Topics are to be applied to
the Original of the Nerves and the Parts grieved, especially if the peccant
humors have diffused themselves too much; and have got into the Concave of the
Nerves: by which happens a Resolution.

49. It is usual after Evacuations to apply Medicines to the relaxed Members,
for in the Apoplexy, which is called an universal Palsy, the Body is wont to be
anointed with the most odoriferous Oil.

50. Moreover Emplasters are useful, which make red the Backbone: an Emplaster
of Lilly-roots with Honey is wont to be commended, to which may be added
Mustard, Castoreum, Euphorbium, Pyrethrum, Pepper.

51. After the same manner there may be exhibited Oil of Foxes, or of Costus,
or of Spiknard, Pepper, Euphorbium, Castoreum and Pyrethrum being mixed
therewith.

52. Many approve of Aqua Vitae which is made of generous Wine, therewith the
Backbone and the Part offended should be rubbed.

53. By others an Ointment made of Vipers is commended; which is to be thus
made: cut off first the Head and Tail of the Viper, which is then to be put
into a Pot bored through with many holes: This Pot is to be put within another
Pot not pierced through, which is to be closly stopped with Clay all round about,
that nothing evaporate; and immediately put the same into a brass Vessel, and
let it boil for three hours: The Oil or Balsam which distills from thence into
the whole Pot, is of that Virtue and Efficacy to cure the Palsy, if the
Backbone and relaxed Parts be anointed therewith.

54. The Decoction of a Viper taken in at the Mouth is wont to be commended,
also the Decoction of an old Cock.

55. The Decoction of a Fox is approved; if it be boiled till the Bones stick
out, neither will it be inconvenient that the same be done in excellent Wine.

56. First the hinder Parts may be embrocated, for it is good for Diseases of
the Nerves, then the fore-parts.

57. A Bath of the Decoction of a Fox, is profitable, to which add Salt and
Dill.

58. Sweat may be provoked thus, let the sick go into a very large Vessel very
well covered, the Head thereof all round about being open; to which set another
Vessel as closs as can be to the other, in which a Fox is to be boiled with
proper Herbs, from whence by a Pipe leading from that Vessel into the other
Vessel where the sick is, the Fume may be conveyed.

59. The Syrup of Sanctus Ambrosius is of excellent use, because by its great
Power to cause sweating, it eases the Nerves and the whole Body of the peccant
matter.

60. I have exhibited it to many, when that which they call Sarsaparilla, China
and Lignum Sanctum could not provoke any ways Sweat; which happened to me, when I
had a certain Person under my Cure, to whom I exhibited Sarsaparilla five and
twenty Days twice a Day; and could not make him sweat, but by the forenamed
Syrup he did sweat so well, that his Malady did presently vanish.

61. You may take Millet well cleansed and hull'd, put it into a Pot in which
is Water, let it boil as much as is convenient, even till it swell and make a
Noise; seven or eight ounces of this Decoction may be taken: It is to be mixed
with three or four ounces of Greek Wine, all which Potion the sick may take
warm in the Morning.

62. Let him after he has taken this be well covered in order to sweating; this
may be used eight, ten or more Days, as necessity shall require.

63. Odorificks, Fumigations, Gargarisms, Masticatories, and Sternutatories
must be exhibited.

64. The following Odorifick is good for comforting the Brain and Heart: Take
Styrax Calamita, Labdanum, of each eight parts: Lignum Aloes, seven parts:
Amber, two parts: Gallia Muschata, six parts: make Balls with the Jelly of
Tragacanth.

65. A Fumigation is usually commended of Musk, Amber, Lignum Aloes, and dried
Myrrh.

66. And this following Gangarism is very profitable, which is to be given warm
four or five times fasting: Take Oxymel of Squills, one: ounce and half: Hiera
Archigenis, Decoction of dry Figs, Pyrethrum and Mustard seed, three ounces:
mix them.

67. The following Masticatory is very commendable and profitable, which is
also to be taken fasting: Take Mastick, one ounce: Pepper, Pyrethrum, Origanum,
of each one dram: Staves-Acre, half a dram: bruise them all together after a
gross manner, and let the sick take thereof half a spoonful at a time, it may
be reduced into the form of Lupins; with the Juice of Sage, or Ivy and a little
Wax.

68. The Sternutatory is to be made of white Hellebor, which is to be blown up
into the Nose, or of Staves-Aore, or of the fresh roots of Sowbread, which is
to be held in the Nose for half an hour, it is called a Ptarmick.

69. You may instill into the Nose the following Liquor with great advantage:
Take Opopanax well bruised, three ounces: mix them with the Oil of wild
Cucumbers, and the Juice of Mouse-Ear, which may be made to the thickness of
Honey that it may run the better, it is to be exhited with a Mixture of the
Juice of Marjoram.

70. Your domistick Baths of Wine and Oil in which proper and drying Herbs are
boiled, do much help, chiefly those wherein the Decoction of Foxes is put.

71. As for natural Baths this Country and Italy afford many, which your
illustrious Highness may make use of; for a Remedy of the Tongue, you may hold
under it Castoreum, or the Juice of Sage, or Castoreum with the Juice of Peony.

72. Castoreum, Cloves, and Nutmegs drank in Wine are also very good.

73. The Head is to be shaved and then anointed with the following Ointment:
Take Sagapenum, Opopanax, Galbanum Ammoniacum, Euphorbium, of each one ounce:
Castoreum, two ounces: let all these be dissolved over the Fire, (the Castoreum
only excepted) Oil of Roses and Bays being mixed therewith to the weight of
all, add thereto a little Wax, and make an Ointment.

74. Immediately after take thirty or forty Cantharides, bruise them in a
little Fat and Honey; and when they are thus mixed apply them to the Nape of the
Neck, for a Vesicatory.

75. The Friction of the Tongue and Pallat is profitable, Treacle and
Mithridate being exhibited.

76, It is reported of a certain Woman, who had lost the Liberty and Use of
speaking, that by taking of thirty grains of Peony hulled, began immediately to
speak again.

77. Letting of blood from the Veins under the Tongue is convenient, provided
it be afterward rubbed with Cresses and Castoreum.

78. An Emplaster of Dogs-Turd in Vinegar, applied to the hinder part of the
Head has restored lost Speech; the Labor of the Hands in this very thing ought
to be used for no other cause than Diversion and Evacuation.

79. Although, as I have said before, that the cause of your Highness
Relaxation, was not without a mixture of Blood and Choler, yet nevertheless,
according to the present state of things, letting of Blood to me seems
unprofitable.

80. Some affirm, That letting of Blood is of no use, unless the person becomes
Paralytick by a stroke.

81. Frictions in the beginning of a Palsy are very profitable, if they be
applied to the whole part.

82. And after evacuation, let the parts affected and the original of the
Nerves have the benefit of Friction; continue it for the space of an hour with
warm and soft Clothes to the Shoulders, Arms, the Marrow of the Backbone,
Belly, Hips, Thighs and Feet.

83. In the extreme parts you may use Frictions a little more vehement: It will
be profitable after evacuations to exhibit frictions to the affected part with
this kind of Powder.

84. Take Mustard Seed, Pepper, Origanum, Ginger, Pyrethrum, of each equal
parts: Salt gem, to the weight of them all: mix them.

85. Cupping-glasses draw the humors from the Nerves to the outmost skin, if
they be applied to the beginning of the Muscles throughout the whole Body; then
in the hinder part, then to the Spondylus; yet without Incision.

86. It will be profitable afterward to apply to the very same places, where
the Cupping-glasses were set, Emplasters which may make red the flesh it self;
but let that be done before Dinner, which remedy perchance may be of greatu se.

87. Ligatures have been sometimes probable for diverting.

88. Cauteries are mightily commended by some, which I very much approve of; I
esteem a Cauterie necessary which is applied to the Coronal suture in the
midst of the Head, after a little time another may be applied to the hinder
part of the Head.

89. Some Practitioners do commend a Cautery in the right part and in the left,
and in the Head it self, to wit, in those places that are nearest to the
Forehead.

90. They also a^vise that in the three Spondyls of the Neck three Cauteries
are to be made by little and little. Lauren. Scholzius. cons. med. 50.

LXXXIII. A Palsy

1. Although it be difficult to determine any thing certainly concerning the
Palsy wherewith this Man is afflicted, because I am ignorant of his other
circumstances; yet that I may not be wanting in the discharge of my Duty, I
shall here prescribe somthings in order to effect the Cure.

2. The first thing after his Diet, which should be according to the
prescription of Art, is purgation, which must be light and frequent, and must
be thus ordered.

3. Take the distilled water of Guajacum, and if that cannot be had, take the
decoction of the bark of Guajacum, three ounces: the water of Sage, of Betony,
of each half an ounce: Wormwood half an ounce: iufuse into them for a Night the
leaves of choice Sena, six drams: Ginger, one dram: Agarick trochiscated, two
scruples: in the Morning strain, to which add syrup of Roses solutive, two
ounces: aromatize with Cinnamon water or Bawm, let it be taken in the Morning
four hours before Dinner, and the same dose continued for eight Days,
increasing the dose or diminishing as shall seem convenient to the Physician.

4. But when he has used this twice or thrice; let him forbear a day or two,
and afterward let the Basilick Vein of the opposite side be opened.

5. Then let him rest for two Days, afterward he may return to the taking of
three or four potions.

6. These things being done, we must come to the use of Sudorificks: boil in
the Broth of flesh the opening roots Parsley and Fennel, or the water of
Guajacum or the decoction of the same; take thereof Morning and Evening four
ounces, and put in twenty four or thirty drops of the same Liquor, which you
have always ready prepared; let him compose himself for a Sweat, which must be
of two hours continuance, yet so as that after an hour he takes some
refreshment.

7. He must Sweat again in the Evening provided he can bear it, but if
otherwise he must Sweat only in the Morning.

8. Let him use a slender diet, such a one as is wont to be prescribed in the
use of Guajacum, after a while a more liberal Diet.

9. When he has sweated for the space of six days, there must also be great
care taken of the affected part, insomuch that in the Morning before he fit
himself for sweating, his Arms and Legs that are affected; be well rubbed with
a hard and rough Cloth, made wet in Childrens Urine, in which Sal Vstulatum
has been dissolved; for one measure of urine let there be one handful of Salt.

10. After sweating the part is to be anointed with Oil of Earthworms, of
Costus, of Cammomil, of Roses; and if the smell can be endured, there may be
added a little of the Oil of Castoreum, and one drop or two of the Oil of
Amber. Laurentius Scholzius, cons. med. 51.

LXXXIV. A Palsy of the one side.

1. When one part of the Body is resolved, it is a certain token of the
Backbone and Menings being affected.

2. All things that offend the Nerves and Head must be shuned, as the cold and
humid constitution of the Air, or a mutation from cold into heat; you must
beware of Noon and Evening sleep with a repleat Body, or in a moist place, also
vehement passions and affections of the mind such as move the humors must be
avoided.

3. Great care is to be taken that the Belly be kept in a good temper; if it be
not loose I know nothing better than Aloes Rosata, let the person take it with
white Sugar after the following direction: Take Aloes, Rosatae, one dram and
half: white Amber, one scruple: Species Diarhodon, one scruple: with syrup of
Betony, make Pills for fourteen drams: and let him take seven of them.

4. But let him take in order for purgation the following syrup before Winter:
Take syrup of Staechas, of Betony, of each half an ounce: the decoction of
Calamus Aromaticus, in water of Betony, three ounces: mix them, he should drink
after it four or five times.

5. The syrup being taken, let him use this potion: Take Raisons, six drams:
Galangal, one dram: Rosemary flowers, Violets, Borage, of each one pugil: the
whitest Agarick, one dram: choice Rhubarb, four scruples: the leaves of Senna,
five drams: make a decoction in a sufficient quantity of pure water, take of
the strained liquor four ounces: choice Manna, syrup of Roses solutive, of each
one ounce: and a little Ginger mix them.

6. If he be not purged enough at one time, he may take the potion again; the
Body being evacuated it may be used thrice in a week during this Winter, as
also the Electuary before ordered to the bigness of a Walnut, the description
whereof is as follows.

7. Take Conserve of Rosemary flowers, three ounces: Treacle, one dram:
Mithridate, half a dram: conserve of Roses, one ounce: mix them.

8. You may make use of Rowls with Oil of Anise and with the Extract of Calamus
Aromaticus; these things aforementioned may seem enough for strengthening the
Nerves and Head; the marrow of the Backbone is to be fomented with the
following water: Take rich Wine well burnt, one pound: infuse in a glass Vessel
well stopped, the flowers of Lavender, Rosemary, of each one pugil: the root of
Calamus, Aromaticus, Galangal, of each half a dram: they must be well cut,
Cloves beaten, two drams: let them stand well covered in a hot place, and use
them in the Morning.

9. Sometimes in a sweating Bath make a fomentation for the affected members of
the decoction of Origanum and Rosemary with Wine; and anoint the affected
Members with this following Ointment, then afterward wash them in a decoction
of Origanum.

10. Take Soap, half a pound: Oil of Juniper, one ounce: Rocket-seeds, six
drams: mix and make an Ointment: to write many more things is not necessary; I
advise him to abstain from all strong Wines, and such things as any wise offend
and weaken the Head; Crat. apud Scholtzium cons. med. 52.

LXXXV. A Palsy of the Leg.

1. An inveterate Palsy of the Leg is not easily cured: Topics cannot, nor
ought not to be applied before the Body is purged, as all learnand experienced
Physicians know; therefore this is the first (to wit) Purgation, of the
remedies which lead the van.

2. This being done, the matter which afflicts the Nerves must be attenuated,
and the natural heat in the Paralytick Member must be comforted.

3. To effect which there is nothing more convenient and agreeable then Grape
kernels; the Leg being afflicted let the Marrow of the Backbone be first of
all anointed with such an Oynment.

4. Take Oil of Costus, three ounces: Malago, one ounce: Calamus, Aromaticus,
Galangal, of each two drams: Castoreum, one dram: let them boil to the
consumption of the Wine, and strain them out strongly by expression, add to the
expression, Oil of Nutmegs, two drams: Cloves, one scruple: Badgers grease, one
ounce and half: Earthworms, a sufficient quantity: make a soft Liniment: let
the lower part of the Marrow of the Backbone be anointed every Morning with
this Liniment.

5. Afterward apply the Grape-kernels hot; the whole Leg is to be as it were
buried in the same, from the Huckle-bone to the sole of the Foot, for the space
of an hour, or so long as they continue hot.

6. These Grape-stones being removed, anoint the Backbone again with the
Ointment first prescribed by me; you must do the same about the time of going
to bed.

7. If the Constitution and Temperament of the Body were altogether known to
me, I would add other Remedies; which strengthen the inward Heat; but those
Physicians that are with the sick may do this better; only I advise that in the
Morning, he may take one spoonful of Honey of Roses, to which add the Extract
of Calamus Aromaticus; it ought to be mixed after this manner.

8. Take Honey of Roses, half a pound: Extract of Calamus Aromaticus, one dram:
mix them: As for Drink, Wine boiled with Sage and Rosemary, or the like
Decoction, or Muscadel may be used. Crato apud Scholtzium, Cons. Med. 53.

LXXXVI. A Palsy of the inferior Parts, with a Convulsion and Pain about the
Region of the Reins and Thighs.

1. As to the Cure, Phlebotomy is not needful herein; because the Malady
proceeds not from the Blood, but it is consonant to reason, that other Humors
do rather abound; his usual Exercises having been laid a-side, and the Body
cooled.

2. But if the Hemorrhoides run, it is not against Reason to draw some Blood
from that place; Issues are mightily commended in both Arms.

3. If all Things external and internal applied to the affected Part avail
nothing; we approve (if there be any suspicion of a density or thickness in the
Marrow of the Backbone) of burning with a hot Iron in that place; that the
matter there contained may by that means be evacuated.

4. A lenitive Medicine may be given of Honey of Roses solutive; as for
Preparatives you may take Syrup of Betony, Succory, Borrage, and because the
sick complained of Obstructions of the Liver and Spleen, things that open are
very proper, yet without any notable heat, such are Peutaphyllum, Agrimony,
Maidenhair, Tamarisk Fern-roots.

5. The Humors being prepared, let them be purged not once but twice with
Agarick, or with Compositions of Agarick, or Pills of Agarick mixed with
Cochiae, and the like.

6. The Head may be purged by the Nostrils by Sternutatories and Juyces
attracted and drawn up by the Nostrils, as the Juice of Beet: and Marjoram.

7. This being done, use is to be made of Salsa, China, Guajacum, Sassafras, as
also the Decoction of Salsa and China; to which because of the Liver, Borrage
and Sucory are to be added.

8. In the more cold Season, if the Malady cease not, Guajacum and Sassafras
are to be used, but if the Season be hot, Conserve of Betony, and such as are
hot only in the first degree, Betony, Mint, Wormwood, Annise, etc. are good for
the Stomach.

9. Medicines that are drying and not much warming are convenient for the Head,
as Baths made of Lie and the Ashes of a Vine, in which are boiled Betony and
Sage-leaves.

10. It will do well to apply an Emplaster first of Melilot for four or six
Days to the Region of the Reins, chiefly where the density is; then for six
Days more to mix the same Emplaster with Emplastrum Sacrum in an equal
proportion.

11. Lastly, apply Triapharmicum a Compound of old Oil, Lithargicum and Vinegar
in equal Portions; to which let there be added Elaterium and Colocynthis.
Capivaccius apud Scholtzium, Cons. Med. 54.

LXXXVII. A Palsy of the right Side with the Cramp and a Trembling.

1. An honest Matron fell into a Palsy of the right Side, it was so violent
that she could neither stir Hand nor Foot of that Side, I followed this Course
in subduing this rebellious and contumacious Disease.

2. Take the Leaves of Prin roses one handful: Betony, Bawm, Germander,
Ceterach, of each half an handful: Fennel roots, five drams: Calamus
Aromaticus, roots of Peony, Orrice, of each three drams: the Bark of Ash-root,
and Capers, of each two drams: the seeds of Fennel, of Anise, of Citrons, of
Carduus Benedict^^ of each half a dram: the Flowers of Staechas, one dram and
half: Cichory, two pugils: Raisons stoned, one ounce: fat Figs cut, number six:
beat them together and make a Decoction.

3. Take Syrup of Staechas, of Betony, of each one ounce and half: Oxymel
simple, Oxymel of Squills, of each half an ounce: mix them: Of this Decoction
and Syrup let her drink warm in the Morning such a Draught every day as that
there be enough left for another time.

4. After this I ordered these following Pills, which are somewhat stronger:
Take Pil. de Hiera with Agarick two scruples: Pil. sine quibus, Pil. Faetidae,
of each half a dram: Pil. Cochiae, one dram: with Sage-Water make sixty Pills.

5. These things I have premised for taking away the peccant Matter by
Preparation and Purgation, it follows now in the next place that the Head and
Stomach being afflicted as appears by the several Indications, we apply such
Things as may corroborate and dry those Parts, repress the venomous Matter, and
preserve from Convulsions and the Epilepsies. For which end I have prescribed
these two following excellent Remedies.

6. The first is a Confect, the other a Powder. The Confect. Take Conserve of
Peony, Rosemary-Flowers, of each half an ounce: Betony, Lavender, of each two
drams: Bugloss, three drams: choice Mithridate, one dram and half: the Powder
of the seeds of Carduus Benedictus, and Fennel-seeds, of each half a dram: the
roots of Peony, two scruples: the Powder of Staechas, half a scruple: Nutmeg,
one dram: Calamus Aromaticus confected, three drams: Ginger confected, six
drams: Citron-Peels, half an ounce: Cinnamon cut, one scruple.

7. The Powder. Take Species Diaxyloaloes, one dram: Diamoschi amari,
Diagalangal, of each half a dram: Powder of Misleto of the Oak, the roots of
Peony, of each four scruples: Orrice, Galangal, Calamus Aromaticus, of each two
scruples: Nutmeg, one scruple: Lignum Aloes, half a scruple: white Sugar, half
an ounce: pulverise mix and make a Powder.

8. She may take of the Confect every Morning the quantity of a Wall-Nut and of
the Powder from half a dram to a dram, either upon Bread toasted, or in a
little Beer; let this be done alternatively; and for some time the use of other
Remedies must be suspended.

9. Mithridate if it be often taken is an excellent Antidote; prepare three
Pills thereof somewhat bigger than a Pease, and let them be swallowed in the
Morning, it consumes the Relicts of the matter of the Spasm, and excites and
revives the natual heat which was oppressed by the said peccant matter.

10. There yet remains two grievous Evils to be vanquished, to wit, the
Resolution of the Marow of the Backbone on the right Side, which caused that
the Arm and Foot could not be used; and a Trembling of the other Side, which
shows the Imbecilty of the Nerves and the Hazard that Side is in also; for
which Purpose make use of the following Ointment, in which dip a double linen
Cloth.

11. Take Oil of Costus, Oil of Earthworms, Mastick of each one ounce: of
Foxes, three drams: of Spikenard, two drams: of Juniper Berries, one dram:
Ammoniacum dissolved in Wine, one dram: Castoreum, half a dram: Aqua Vitae
rectified, one dram and half: Turpentine, two drams: Wax, half an ounce: mix
and make a Liniment.

12. Lastly, the Matrix seemed to be afflicted with some flatulent or other
matter; from whence did arise that impetuous Storm which did shake and agitate
the whole vicinity of the Veins, Heart, Stomach, Head and Sides; for allaying
and discussing of which, I have sent an Emplaster, which being spread on
Leather and covered with Silk is to be aplyed to the region of the Vesica,
according to the bigness of the Tumor and hardness, it is to be often and long
used.

13. But if the too often use thereof be troublesome, you may desist a little
while the use thereof. The Emplaster is this: Take Emplastrum Matricale,
Melilot, of each two ounces, mix them.

14. To smell frequently to Castoreum is profitable, as well for the sake of
the Womb as the Head. Hosmanus apud Scholtzium, Con. Med. 326.

LXXXVIII. A Palsy from a Cholick.

1. (...), which always follows a Cholick Pain, differs from a Paralysis, which
is either an Apoplexy or a Paraplegia, both in the original and cause. In the
Palsy the Brain, and the beginning of the Nerves are afflicted, and therein we
apply remedies to the Head and Backbone.

2. The Paresis arises from a Cholick in the Bowels, and seizes with a kind of
violence the external parts, as also the Muscles and Tendons, and oftentimes
the principal of the Nerves i^ affected.

3. First we ought to endeavor to correct the intemperature of the Intestines,
and then dissipate the peccant matter which is in the external Members, and to
strengthen them.

4. I exhibited with good success for this in temperature of the Bowels, the
Distillation of Galbanum, Bay Berries, and Gum Elemi: Take Galbanum, Elemi,
Ivy, Oil of Bays or Bay Berries, of each equal parts: distill them, saving the
several matters distilling over by themselves, first the Water, then the clear
Oil, and lastly the thick Oil like Honey (which some suppose to be best.)

5. Take Nettle roots: three handfuls: Gout-Ivy, two handfuls: Bay Berries,
Sage, Rue, Rosemary, of each one handful: Juniper Berries, one handful and
half: cut them and prepare them for a Bath.

6. Take Badgers-grease, the grease of a Fox, of a Hen, of a Duck, of a Goose,
of a Stork, of each one ounce: the juyces of Sage and Wormwood inspisated, of
each half an ounce: Oil of Bays, two ounces: mix them and make an Ointment,
which make use of after bathing. Crato apud Scholzium, Consil. med. 172.

LXXXIX. A Palsy after a Cholick.

1. In this Palsy of the Hands after a Cholick, the Evil being in the bruised
Muscles; first for expelling the matter from the Muscles by exhalations and
sweats, there was used a Sudorifick, Fomentation and Ointment here
aftermentioned.

2. The Sudorifick: Take syrup of Betony, of the juice of Carduus, of each two
ounces and half: the best Treacle, two drams: mix them. I used this, but it
proved but a slender Sudorifick.

3. I prefer the syrup of Ambrose; let the sick take one spoonful thereof in
the Morning, every other day; and keep his Bed, that by sleep and fomentation
his sweating may be increased.

4. The Fomentation: Take Sage, Origanum, Rosemary, Gout-Ivy, of each three
handfuls: cut them and boil them, and let the decoction with the hot Herbs be
infused into a Vessel prepared for that use, which cover in the top with a
Cloth four times doubled; then foment the Hands for a quarter of an hour,
Morning and Evening before Supper.

5. The Ointment: Take Hens grease; the fat or grease of a Heron, of a Badger,
of each one ounce: of Earthworms washed in Wine, one ounce and half: boil them
over a slow Fire, and add the Oil of Nutmegs, mix them and make a Liniment, to
be used after fomentation.

6. Add to these Soap of such a kind as shall be presently described, with
which the sick may wash his Hands after fomentation and anointing; this Soap
will of its own accord grow dry in the Hands, the description of this Soap is
as follows.

7. Take Venice Soap, Mucilage of Marshmallows, of each one ounce:
Rocket-seeds, bruised, two drams: Oil of Juniper berries, half an ounce: mix
them.

8. But if by the above mentioned things you are not any thing the better, in
the place of the aforesaid Fomentation: Take Nettle roots, three handfuls:
Cumin seed, one ounce: Salt, three drams: mix them and boil them as
above-directed.

9. In the place of the aforenamed Ointment this which follows may be also
taken: Take old Oil, half a pound: Hogs Blood, three ounces: Castoreum, one
dram: with a little Wax, mix and make a Liniment.

10. I have used both the first and second, and the second in the first; by
which I perceived the Trembling of my Hands (For my Feet were always firm)
palpably to vanish; in so much that I had no occasion to use these following
remedies.

11. But if the last above mentioned Ointment have not efficacy enough; the
following stronger Ointment may be used: Take the shells of black Snails, burn
them in some Pitcher and save of the liquid Fat, two ounces: the Fat of a
Heron, of a Badger, of a Dog, of each one dram: Goats and Hearts Sewet, of each
six drams: Venice Soap with the juice of Carduus and Marshmallows dissolved, a
sufficient quantity; mix them over a gentle fire.

12. But if yet a stronger Medicine be required the following Ointment may be
applied: Take the powder of Earthworms, two ounces: Calamus Aromaticus, six
drams: Galangal, four drams: clarified Honey, a sufficient quantity, boil them
to a thickness. Crato apud Scholtzium Epist. Medic. 237.

XC. The Palsy of the Tongue.

1. An ancient Woman about sixty eight years of age, was afflicted with a Palsy
of the Tongue.

2. By my advice the flowers of Lavender were infused in Spirit of Wine;
afterward for some days Morning, and Evening, she took before she went to Bed,
one ounce thereof; and from that time she began to speak more plainly. Martinus
Rulandus, Cent. 4. Cur. 55.

XCI. The Palsy of the Tongue.

1. A Country Man by some Blows and Hurt that he received, fell into a Palsy of
the Tongue, having therewith a Pain in his right Side occasioned by the former
accident; he had the exercise of his reason; but could not speak; he was cured
by me with the following Medicines.

2. I took the bigness of a pease of my Sternutatory with Musk, and by a quill
did thrice blow it up into his Nostrils; from whence more frequent
Sternutations were excited.

3. In the next place I did anoint his Tongue which was resolved with the Oleum
Ligni Heraclij; afterward I gave him half a spoonful by degrees of the Oleum
Heraclium; when he had taken thrice of this, his Speech was restored, and he
could articulately express the Sentiments of his mind.

4. His right side that was pained I did gently rub with Rags dipped in
Butter; in which Cumin bruised was sprinkled, by this the Pain of the Side was
removed.

5. I did also prescribe this Purge for evacuating the impurity of the
coagulated Blood; which should be used in all contusions and bruises.

6. Take Extractum Esula, one dram: the Whey of Milk, six ounces: mix them;
boil them once, then strain, aftwerwards drink it all off.

7. His body being well purged, by this he began to glow very well; after this,
he descended into a Chalybeated Bath; then after going out of the Bath, his
Head was washed with a Lie of Marjoram, Penyroyal etc. this being done; he was
rostored to his Health, and soundness of Body. Martinus Rulandus, Cent. 7. Cur.
36.

XCII. The Palsy of the Tongue.

1. A Man in the fifteenth year of his age, was afflicted with a Palsy
accompanied with want of rest; I exhibited to him these following things: Take
Fountain water, six ounces: so much of the Oil of Vitriol as is sufficient to
correct the crudity of the Water; he took every hour of this water one spoonful.

2. And because he was slow in expressing himself distinctly; I did prescribe
this following Cathartick potion: Take extractum Colocynthidis, the bigness of
a Nut, Whey two ounces: mix them: this being done he drunk it up warm; upon
which followed a plentiful evacuation; yet the impediment of his Tongue
remained.

3. Wherefore the next day I exhibited this following Holagog: Take Spiritus
vitae Auraei, one ounce: syrup of Liquorice, one dram: mix them, by this a
great quantity of watery and serous matter was expurgated.

4. His Speech being wholly restored, before I exhibited this dose, and also in
the very time of the operation, I anointed his Paralytick Tongue with our Oleum
Heraclij drop by drop, with good success, then I advised him to sweat
liberally; which being done, I ordered his Head to be washed with the following
Lie.

5. Take Fountain Water, good Lie, of each two pounds: the Heads of white
Poppies, number six: boil them all together to the Consumption of six ounces:
let his Head be washed in the Decoction to incline him to sleep.

6. And because of the Pain in the Head, whereof he complained; I ordered his
Cephalic Vein to be opened; by this he was restored to perfect Health.
Martinus Rulandus, Cent. 7. Cur. 53.

XCIII. A Palsy of the Tongue.

1. A certain married Woman, was suddenly taken with a Palsy of the Tongue, I
being then present; insomuch that she could not speak, yet she was sound in her
Intellectuals; her Urine was muddy and watery; and another bad Symptom did
accompany the former, which was a Pain of ihe Head.

2. For removing and eradicating this Disease, we ordered first the use of our
Sternutatory; then the whole Tongue was to be washed thrice with our Oleum
Heraclii.

3. I applied to the Crown of his Head, a Ferment sprinkled with Amber
pulverized.

4. Take Cinnamon Water, five ounces: Oil of Vitriol, so many drops as are
sufficient to render it acid: I gave her often one spoonful of this Water or
about half an ounce.

5. All these things being administered according to Prescription; she began to
speak distinctly in the space of one Day, and to walk about. Martinus Rulandus,
Cent. 8. Cur. 77.

XCIV. A Palsy of the Tongue and Arm.

1. A Man about sixty six years of Age was delivered from and cured of this
Disease by the following Medicines: Take Syrup of Roses solutive Montanae,
three ounces: Lavender-Water, three ounces: mix them for a Potion, this,
wrought well.

2. Take Wine, four ounces: rectified Oil of Vitriol, so many drops as are
sufficient to render the Wine acid: This was first still applied to the Tongue,
till he began to speak.

3. His Meats were few and drying; his Drink was Lavender-Water in which Sugar
was dissolved; by these few Medicament he began to speak and walk. Martinus
Rulandus, Cent. 8. Cur. 71.

XCV. A Palsy with a chronical Pain of the Head.

1. A Man about two and forty years was taken with a Palsy accompanied with a
chronical Pain of the Head; the Cure was undertaken thus.

2. Take Pil. sine quibus, two scruples: Agarick trochiscated, half a dram:
with the Water of Cinnamon, make nine Pills: which were taken after Supper; and
he was well purged.

3. Take Wormwood, Origanum, Mint, Juniper Berries, of all an equal part: boil
them in a sufficient quantity of Lie for a sweating Bath: By which he sweat
abundantly, and the Parts affected were from that time more and more restored
to their proper use and motion. Martinus Rulandus, Cent. 9. Cur. 96.

XCVI. A Palsy cured in a Man fifty years of age.

1. This Man in his declining years was through taking Cold by going in the
Wet, in the Wintertime, seized with the Palsy, wherein he lost both his Sense
of Feeling and Motion: so that he was forced to lie for many weeks bedridden, not
being able to help himself.

2. His Physician coming to him ordered him to take constantly Morning and
Night two or three ounces of the Queen of Hungaria's-Water, and also to repeat
the use of it for several times in the Day; and to be taken either alone or in
a glass of choice Canary.

3. Moreover he made a Mixture of Ox Galls, two pounds: with pure Oil of
Vitriol, eight ounces: which being well mixed and digested together for the
space of forty Days: He caused the paralytick Parts to be very well bathed
therewith twice a day for twelve days.

4. This done he caused all the said Parts to be afterward bathed with the
Queen of Hungaria's-Water, Morning and Evening for a month together; by the use
of which means this diseased Patient was in less than two Months time restored
to perfect Health.

5. By the use of these very Medicaments, and the same Method exactly, the same
Physician affirmed, he had cured more then twenty several Persons of the Palsy.
Anonymus.

XCVII. A Palsy of the Tongue.

1. A noble Matron of a whitish Color, phlegmatic, living in a very wet and
moist place, was obnoxious to distillations of Rheum, about the fiftieth year
of her age, a thin Phlegm falling down from the Brain into the Nerves of the
Tongue; and filling up all their Passages; she became suddenly afflicted with a
Palsy of the Tongue; the animal Faculty not having free Course, insomuch that
she could not move her Tongue.

2. We thought it therefore convenient to subdue and evacuate the pituitous
humor which did abound, for upon this the dissolution of the whole Disease did
depend.

3. First of all then we ordered the following Clyster: Take of common
Decoction, one pound: in which boil the Leaves of Betony, Sage, Marjoram, of
each one handful: the Flowers of Cammomil, Melilot, Rosemary, Staechas, of each
one pugil: to which add the Electuary of Hiera Picra, Diaphaenicon, of each two
drams: Diacatholicon, Electuarium Lenitivum, of each half an ounce: Oil of
Cammomil, Oil of Lillies, of each one ounce and half: Honey of
Rosemary-Flowers, or if that cannot be had, Honey of Roses, half an ounce:
common Salt, one dram: Salt Gem, half a dram: mix them and make a Clyster.

4. This having sufficiently purged him, I gave him on the next day the
following Pills: Take Pil. Asajeret, Agarick trochiscated, Pil. Cochiae, of
each one scruple: with the Water of Sage, make five Pills: which she took so
soon as she went to bed.

5. When we had effected our Design with the Clyster; we let her Blood in the
Cephalic Vein; now because there was not a Repletion of the whole, but of a
part, to wit, the Head which was filled with Phlegm; after taking the Pills at
another time, we applied Cupping-glases with Scarification.

6. Afterward finding that the Veins under the Tongue did in some measure
appear to be swelled, we commanded them to be opened.

7. Moreover for digestion of the matter she used a Decoction of the Leaves of
Primroses, Cowslips, Sage, Marjoram, Betony, Origanum, the Flowers of Staechas,
with which Honey of Roses, Oxymel simplex, Syrup of Staechas and Betony were
mixed.

8. After a while I purged her with the following Pills: Take Pil. Paetidae
Mes. Pil. Cochiae, de Agarico, of each one scruple and half: with Betony Water
make five Pills: by which the Belly was purged egregiously.

9. On the second day after she took one dram of Treacle, with the Conserve of
the Flowers of Rosemary, one dram; when this was done, we used Gargarisms of
the Decoction of Hysop and roots of Capers; Pyrethrum, Origanum, Sage, Figs,
and in the end of the Decoction a little Mustard, Honey of Roses and Oxymel for
a seasoning.

10. I ordered her Tongue to be rubbed with these or the like: White Wind
persumed, and a little Castoreum being added do much good if it be moderately
done; the Tongue is to be rubbed with Mustard alone, not with the Juice of
Tithymal, etc. as some think.

11. We ordered the hinder Part of the Head and Neck to be anointed with the
following Oils: Take Oil of Costus, Oil of Spikenard, Oil of Lillies, of each
half an ounce: mix them: let the Parts after anointing be covered warm with the
Skin of a Fox or Hare.

12. Lastly, we raised Vesicatories in the Neck, Cantharides being applied (but
the Heads and Wings were taken away) with Leaven, or in place thereof, Fat,
which being broke open, a yellowish Sort of Water flowed forth, and then I
applied a Colewort Leaf.

13. After this Remedy for evacuating the Water she began immediately to speak;
and I further commanded that she should take every day of the following
Confection for strengthening of the Nerves in order to her more ready and
distinct speaking.

14. Take the Conserves of Rosemary-Flowers, Sage, Betony, of each half an
ounce: the Powder of Diamoschi dulcis, two scruples: Nutmeg pulverized, two
scruples: Castoreum, one dram: with the Honey of Rosemary-Flowers, or the Honey
of Roses, and Oxymel, of Squills, of each half an ounce: make a Confection.

15. I advised these following to be often held in the Mouth: Take Nutmeg, one
dram: Castoreum, two drams: with the Juice of Sage make Confections in the form
of Lupines. Petrus Forestus, Lib. 14. Observe. 32.

XCVIII. An universal Palsy.

1. An ancient Man of sixty eight years, no ways addicted to Melancholy, but
merry and facetious, fell suddenly into an universal Palsy, his Legs, Arms and
Hand being resolved, his Speech was somewhat impeded, he was very weak being
(besides some Defect and Eclipse of his Mind) afflicted with an Asthma and
Straitness of his Breast.

2. Antonius Schinckelius a Physician in the Hague came to visit him, who
ordered that his Temples and paralytick Members should be sprinkled and rubbed
with the Water of Lavender, and that the following Syrup should be sometimes
administered: Take Syrup of Staechas, of Betony, of Roses solutive, of each one
ounce: Oil of Vitriol, nine drops: mix them: these Things were prescribed by
him.

3. Within a day or two I was called, finding him very weak and bound in his
Belly; I thought it meet to administer to him a Clyster for diversion and
subduction of the Belly, which was as follows: Take the Ponder of the Species
of Hiera Picra, Troches of Alhandal, of each one scruple: a little Salt with a
sufficient quantity of Sugar, make a Clyster: whereby twice or thrice he had a
stool; and because it was easy of operation, it was repeated every two or three
days.

4. Then when this was done we ordered the subsequent Medicines to be observed;
and with the first Clyster, the following Ointment: Take the Oil of Marjoram,
the Oil of Costus, of each half an ounce, mix them: and then let the Backbone
beginning at the Nape even to the Os Sacrum be anointed therewith Morning and
Evening.

5. Moreover when he could better endure those Medicaments, we prescribed for
him these Pills: Take Pil. Cochiae, half a dram: Pil. Aureae, half a scruple:
make seven Pills: by which he had seven stools.

6: Not long after this following solutive was also given him: Take Syrup of
the Infusion of Roses with the Leaves of Sena, one ounce and half: Agarick
trochiscated, Specierum Benedicta Laxativa, of each half a scruple: Sage-Water,
one ounce and half, mix them: by which Potion he had above six stools.

7. When this was taken, we ordered that his Legs and other paralytick Members
should be anointed with this Liniment twice a day: Take the Oil of Marjoram,
the Oil of Costus, of each half an ounce: Aqua Vitae, one dram: mix them.

8. Then the following Apozem was prescribed: Take the Barks of the roots of
Succory, Peony, of each one ounce: the Flowers of Staechas, Rosemary, of each
one pugil: Cowslips, Betony, Marjoram, Sage, Origanum, Bay Leaves, of each one
handful: Damask-Prunes, number thirteen: Raisons of the Sun stoned, one ounce:
Carthamus-seeds a little bruised, half an ounce: the pure Leaves of Sena, six
drams: Polypody of the Oak, one ounce: Aniseeds, one dram and half: boil them
in common Water, for one pound of the straining add Syrup of Betony made of
Betony alone, Oxymel simple, of each one ounce and half: mix them for four
Doses.

9. Then take what follows: Take the Conserves of the Flowers of Betony, Sage,
Borrage, Rosemary, of each half an ounce: Nutmeg confected, three drams:
Confection of Mithridate, one dram: Oxymel simple, Syrup of the Juice of
Betony, of each half an ounce: mix them and make a Confection: which he took
twice or thrice a day, to the bigness of a Chest-nut.

10. There was also another Confection ordered him: Take Conserves of Borrage,
one ounce: Conserves of Betony, Sage, of each half a dram: Lozenges of Sugar
pearled, two drams: for the trouble of his Mind.

11. But as this and the Asthma with a shortness of Breath wherewith he was
affected, was not great; so I ordered him to take the following Syrup: Take
Syrup of Maiden hair, four ounces: Syrup of Hysop, one ounce: mix them.

12. He anointed his Breast with the Oil of sweet Almonds; by which Remedies
those Symptoms ceased.

13. But we shall now again return to the Palsy, which of them all is the most
difficult to cure, and most grievous to bear, for this we ordered the following
Decoction: Take the Barks of the roots of Succory, Lions-tooth, of each one
ounce and half: the Cordial-Flowers, one pugil: Succory, Borrage, Maidenhair,
Betony, golden Maidenhair, Cowslips, of each one handful: the four greater
Cold-seeds, of each one dram: Raisons stoned, one ounce: boil them in Water, to
nine ounces of the straining add the Syrup of maidenhair, Syrup of Betony, of
each one ounce: mix them, and make an Apozem for three Doses.

14. Afterward he also took this Decoction being in danger of falling into a
Fever: Take the Barks of the roots of Succory, Lions-tooth, of each one ounce:
the Cordial-Flowers, one pugil: Cowslips, Carduus Benedictus, Betony,
Germander, of each one handful: the four greater Cold-seeds, of each one dram:
Carthamus-seeds a little bruised, half an ounce: Raisons of the Sun stoned, one
ounce: make a Decoction in Water, and to one pound of the strained Liquor add
Syrup of Roses solutive, two ounces: mix them and make an Apozem to be taken at
four Doses every Morning.

15. He always had at the least two stools a day by each of the foregoing
Doses: And because he could not sometimes sleep well, we gave him a
Barley-Drink, which he took at night.

16. Take clean Barley, one ounce: swee Almonds blanched, one ounce and half:
the four greater Cold-seeds, of each one scruple: Lettice-seed, half a dram:
make a Barley-Drink for eight ounces, sweeten it with Sugar pearled according
to Art: this Drink he used two or three times.

17, But the Palsy does require hotter, dryer and more attenuating Medicines,
such as Diambra, Diamoschu, Confection of Mithridate and Treacle.

18. Wherefore he sleeping now much better and finding his feverish kind of
heat much abated, and the above mentioned Symptoms ceasing; we became most
intent on the Cure of the Palsy.

19. Therefore we exhibited to him again the abovenamed Pills; not long after
we gave him in the Morning two scruples of choice Treacle in a little
Rhenish-Wine, and he did sweat sufficiently; otherwise if he had not sweat we
had given him to one dram thereof.

20. Which being done, we continued the foregoing Ointments; then he began to
move his Hands and to lift them to his Head, and to walk a little about his
Chamber, his Servants supporting him.

21. In the next place we thought of somewhat that would strengthen the
paralytick Members, which was the following Apozem: Take the roots of Peony,
half an ounce: the Flowers of Rosemary, and Staechas, of each one pugil: Sage,
Betony, Marjoram, Cowslips, Bay Leaves, Carduus Benedictus, of each one
handful: Raisons stoned, one ounce: Coriander seeds prepared, half a dram:
Cubebs, one scruple: boil them in Water for nine ounces, let them stand in the
Infusion: in the Morning strain and add to the Liquor choice Cinnamon, one
dram: and Syrup of Staechas, and of Betony, of each one ounce: mix them and
make a Wine after the manner of Claret for six Doses.

22. This Apozem being twice or thrice repeated with the above named Consects,
and by anointing often the Paralytick with the Ointments above specified, his
Speech was not only restored, but his paralytick Members recovered also their
former Strength and that in so short a time that this ancient Man's Recovery was
accounted little less than a Miracle; he did also very strictly and cheerfully,
observe all the Instructions which we gave him, which did exceedingly
facilitate the Cure. Petrus Forestus, Lib. 18. Observe. 14.

XCIX. A Palsy of the Thumb from the cutting of a Muscle.

1. One having lost the motion of his Thumb by cuting one of the Muscles, and
having also lost by that Accident, the Use and Strength thereof, was cured by
the following Cere-Cloth, applied by Laurentius Bruninck.

2. Take the Mucilage of Line-seed, the roots of Althaea, of each one ounce:
Ammoniacum, Serapinum dissolved all Night in White Wind, of each half a dram:
Frankincense, Mastick, of each two drams: Oil of Foxes, one ounce: Wax, half an
ounce: make a Cere-Cloth according to Art: spread a small quantity of this
Ointment upon Leather, according to the largness of the wounded Member; by
which Remedy the Person found himself to be much better.

3. We have given you several Examples of Persons that have been taken with the
Palsy by this or the like Accidents: Some by Bruises, Blows and Wounds in the
Head and Neck have fallen first into a light Apoplexy, then into a Palsy; the
History of which and their proper Cures, as also their Causes and Signs we have
given you in their peculiar Places.

4. We have likewise told you how difficult, or rather incurable this Disease
is, which is most evident in old Men, who are scarcely ever freed from it.

5. If a Trembling and Fever follow upon a Palsy; and that also which comes
from a Blow or Wound, provided the Nerves be not too much bruised and torn, it
is possible that such a Palsy may be cured; but on the contrary a Palsy that is
occasioned by some signal Contusion or tearing asunder of the Nerves, is really
incurable.

6. Avenzoar, according to the Judgment of Galen, says, That if the Nerves
which serve Respiration be wounded, there is em^nent danger of sudden Death.

7. If the resolved Member grow nothing less, nor is weak nor corrupted, there
is some hopes of a Cure, but on the contrary, if it grows discernably feebler
and smaller and the native Color perishes; it portends no good nor easy Cure
to the Patient.

8. In the Cure of a Palsy or the resolution of the Nerves from a Wound or any
other extrinsical Cause, the whole Body is to be purged or Blood is to taken,
or both is to done; and the Humors which have their influx upon the resolved
Part are to be diverted, and strict Rules of Diet which have been above
prescribed are to be followed.

9. Proper Topics should be also set against this mighty Disease; outwardly
diverse Remedies are to be applied and made use of in a Palsy proceeding from a
Wound, such as Emplasters, Cataplasms, Ointments, Fomentations Cupping-Glasses,
and the like.

10 Guido did use this one Liquor very well, described by Mesues in the
Passions of the Heart, with which the whole Back is anointed and it is this:
Take choice Myrrh, Aloes, Spikenard, Sanguis Draconis, Frankincense, Mummia,
Opobalsamum, Opopanax, Bdellium, Carpobalsamum, Ammoniacum, Sarcocolla,
Saffron, Mastick, Gum Arabic, liquid Styrax, of each two drams or two drams
and half: choice Labdanum, Castoreum, of each two drams and half: Musk, half a
dram: choice Turpentine, the weight of them all: pulverize those which are to
be pulverized, let them be all mixed with the Turpentine, then put them into an
Alembick, which distill over a gentle Fire and receive for Use the subtle Liquor.

11. Guido de Cauliaco did add to this precious Liquor, Herbs proper for and
dedicated to the Palsy, and as he witnesses, it did help more effectually.
Petrus Forestus, Lib. 6. Observe. Chirurg. 20.

C. A Palsy cured by Paracelsus.

1. One (says he) was troubled with the Palsy, whom I cured only with the
Essence of Wall-Flowers, drawn with the Spirit of Wine.

2. Note. First it is to be supposed that this Essense was either a Tincture
drawn from the dried Herb with the best rectified Spirit of Wine, such as will
fire Gun-Pouder: Or otherwise such an Essence as is made of the Juice of the
Herb with an addition of Spirit of Wine, as we have taught in our Doron
Medicum, Lib. 1. Cap, 15. Sect. 2. 1. where you shall receive further
Satisfaction. Salmon.

3. Note. That as to the use of the Medicament, it is possible, that he might
as well give it inwardly in any proper Vehicle good against the Palsy; as apply
it outwardly to the Part by Bathings and Fomentations. Salmon.

4. A complete Palsy, or benummedness and loss of Motion: A Boy fifteen years
old falling down a stone pair of Stairs, had his Arm and Leg benumbed and void
of moving; whose Neck with the hinder Part of the Head and all the Backbone I
anointed with this following Ointment.

5. Take Fox Grease, two ounces: Oil of Earthworms, one ounce: Oil of Bricks,
half an ounce: mix them together and anoint therewith: It was accordingly done,
and in short space, no Wound, Swelling or Palsy appeared in him. Paracelsus.

SCHOLIA. The THEORY of a PARALYSIS or PALSY.
By the Author W. Salmon.
CI. The Pathology of the Palsy, and first of the Notation thereof.

1. The Names. It is called in Greek (...), in Latin Paralysis, Resolutio
Nervorum, and in English the Palsy. Paralysis a (...) id est, resolvi, dicitur,
for that the Nerves, and the Muscles in whom also the Nerves are inserted, are
so resolved and weakened, that they are wholly unfit to exercise the Motum (...)
or voluntary Motion.

2. The Definition. Est videlicet Paralysis, motus in Part una, vel pluribus
abolitio, (nonnunquam and Sensus simul aboletur) ob Spirituum animalium ad
motuum spontaneum necessariorum Defectum. Sennertus. Paralysis Resolutio
Nervorum est, ubi aut totum Corpus, excepto Capite, aut alterutrum Latus, aut
Corporis duntaxat aliqua Pars, videlicet Pes, Manus, aut Lingua, Motu, ac Sensu
simul, aut Motu tantum privata est. Joel. Paralysis describitur, nempe, quod
sit, Partium nervosarum a debita tensitate Resolutio, sive Relaxatio, cujus
ratione Motus and Sensus, nempe aut alter tantum, simul uterque, in toto
Corpore, vel in quibusdam Partibus debito more exerceri nequit. Willis. A Palsy
is a loss of Sense and Motion in some Parts of the Body, by reason of the
stopping of the Conduits or Passages of the animal Spirits. Riverius. Among
these, Willis his Definition is the most ample, viz. that it is (namely the
Palsy) a Resolution or Relaxation of the nervous Parts from their natural or
due Habit, by which means Motion and Sense, to wit, either the one only, or
both together in the whole Body, or in some Parts can not be exercised after
their due Manner. But Joel will have it, that if the whole Body, together with
the Head be affected, it is not a Paralysis but an Apoplexy, and indeed most
Authors say, That an Apoplexy is an universal Palsy of the whole Body.

3. The Kinds or Differences. It is either universal, called (...), in which
the whole Body (the Head excepted) is affected: Or particular, called (...), in
which some Part or Parts are seized therewith. 2. It is either on both Sides of
the Body, called (...). Or on the one half or Side of the Body, and is called
(...). But some Authors use all these Terms promiscuously, for one and the same
Disease, viz. for a Resolution of the Nerves, which is a loss of Sense and
Motion in any Part of the Body. 3. It is either perfect, in which Sense and
Motion are quite gone: Or imperfect, wherein Sense and Motion are only decayed
or diminished; and in this case, if the diminution be but small, it cannot be
properly Paralysis, a Palsy, but rather Stupor or Torpor, a numbedness, which
is commonly the Forerunner of a true Palsy. 4. A Palsy may be either from the
hurt of the motive Faculty the sense remaining found: Or, from the hurt of the
Sense, the motive Faculty remaining well. 5. A Palsy may arise either from a
solution of unity in the Nerves, as by a Bruise from a Fall, or Blow; or by a
Wound: or, from a relaxation of the Vertebrae of the Back, suddenly caused. 6.
It is either from Causes innate, as 1. From cold pituitous humors which relax
and dissolve the Tone of the Nerves. 2. From straightness or narrowness of the
Nerves caused by Obstructions: Or, by Constipation from some Tumor, etc. 3.
From thin, sharp, serous, and windy humors, moved in the Bowels not only to the
beginnings of the Orifices of the Nerves, but to the very Muscles and Tendons.
Or, from causes external and foreign, as from Narcoticks and Poisons, as
touching the fish Torpedo, immeasurable drinking strong Liquors, taking of
Henbane, Poppies, Opium, Quicksilver, Antimony, Arsenick, etc. To these
external Causes may also be added, the excess of heat or cold; by the first of
which the Spirits are wasted and spent, and by the latter of which, they are
obstructed in their passages by Congelation, etc. 7. It is either Idopathetick,
or by consent of Parts; and that for the most part in a scorbutic habit of
body.

CII. The signs of a Palsy.

1. The Pathognomick signs of a Palsy are the hurts of the motive and sensitive
faculty: for where the loss of motion and sense is, there is certainly a
Paralysis, or Palsy.

2. Where these Symptoms are universal, there the Paralysis is universal: if
they afflict but one part only, those part only suffers by the Palsy: Sometimes
it affects but one side of the body; and sometimes it affects both.

3. If the sense and motion be both wholly lost, the Palsy is said to be
perfect: if they be not absolutely destroyed, but only depraved, it is but an
imperfect Palsy, and is rather a kind of Torpor, Stupor, or Numness.

4. If the motion be only hurt, and the sense perfect, yet it is a Palsy; so
also if the sense be abolished, and the motion remains: but this kind of Palsy
in my opinion ought rather to be called an Hemiplegia, than that which only
afflicts one side.

5. Hence it appears, that the kinds of the Palsy is easily known, from the
abolition of the motive and sensitive faculties, according to the part or parts
affected being discoverable by the Eye; and the habit of the body in which it
happens: but the principal part affected, or what first suffers, is with more
difficulty to be discerned, being only known from Anatomical Learning, which
teaches the original and distribution of the Nerves through all the parts of
the body.

6. If the right or left side of the Face has the Palsy, and no other part
suffers, the Brain is only hurt in that part from whence the Nerves are
brought, which distribute their branches to those sides of the Face: but if the
parts under the Head be affected, together with the Face, then it is a sign
that the Spinal Marrow is hurt as well as the Brain: and, if the parts beneath
the Head are hurt, and not the Face, the fault is only in the Spinal Marrow,
and some of the Nerves springing from thence.

7. If one half of the body only has the Palsy, only one half of the Spinal
Marrow and Nerves thence proceeding are affected: but if the whole body
suffers, then is the whole Spine afflicted from its very original.

8. Now the disaffection of the Spinal Marrow, is that which hinders the afflux
of the Animal Spirit, the principal Instrum nt not only of sense but also of
all natural motions: for by reason of its discrasy, it can neither communicate
to the Muscles the faculty of moving, nor to the Nerves the power of feeling,
for that the parts into which it is inserted become unprofitable.

9. And this is true, whether the passage of the said Animal Spirit is
interrupted by a solution of Unity; or Obstructed by a morbifick matter, or
otherwise constringed; for by either of these hindrances the said Animal
Spirit, can no longer have a free passage through the nervous System, flow
through or fill it up, or not so amply as it ought to do.

10. In whatsoever place this hinderance happens, whether about the Spinal
Marrow, or about the conjugations or branches of Nerves proceeding there from,
it causes a Palsy, either of more or fewer parts, according as the Nerve
affected is more general or particular.

11. We shall now declare what Nerves affected do produce a Paralysis in each
respective Part. If the Nerves nere to the Brain, or in the beginning of their
Passage from the Brain, or the spinal Marrow lying next under the Brain be hurt
or effected, there is commonly a general Palsy, wherein also breathing, the
Voice, Speech, and Swallowing with some excresive Motions do suffer hurt.

12. But if the hurt is in the following production of this Marrow, it makes
those Members only paralytick, into which its Branches of Nerves are inserted:
But the Palsy is so much the more general, by how much the affect of the said
spinal Marrow is nere to the Brain, or original of the Nerves.

13. If the Ey be affected with the Palsy, the visive Nerves are originally
hurt, as also the Cerebrum adjacent it self: If the Tongue is paralytick, the
Conjugation of Nerves serving the Tongue is hurt, and the Speech is also
defective: and by reason of its Community with the auditory Nerve, if the
defect be so great, as to cause a perfect loss of Speech, then the sick is for
the most part deaf also.

14. If there be a Palsy of the Larynx, Tongue, Jaws, Midriff, as also of the
Bladder and Fundament, those Nerves (which some Authors account) of the sixth
and seventh Conjugations are hurt about their original: If there be a defect of
the Voice, the recurrent Nerve is affected: If there be a defect in Swallowing,
the Nerves which go to the Muscles of the Jaws are hurt: If there be danger of
Suffocation, the Nerves which go to the Midriff are hurt, though the Midriff,
(the Instument of Breathing) can otherwise in some sort perform its Office, for
that it receives Nerves also from the spinal Marrow.

15. If the Sphincters of the Bladder and Anus be paralytick, from whence
follows in the one an involuntary Pissing, in the other a Relaxation of the
Fundament; the Conjugations of Nerves supplying those Parts, are generally
disaffected.

16. If the Palsy is in the Legs, the Nerves affected, are about the bottom of
the spinal Marrrow, and the Vertebrae of the Os Sacrum: And thus we must seach
out for the place whence the Nerves spring, which are dispersed to those Parts
which are afflicted with the Palsy.

17. From these things it is apparent, what Conjugations of Nerves are most
afflicted; and that in universal Palsies, there is for the most part an
affliction of the whole Genus Nervosum or nervous System; which many time comes
to pass from the effects of Poison, and the Contamination of the neurotick
Juice by the fuliginous Vapors of Arsenick, Antimony, and Quicksilver.

18. Galen relates a Story of a Man, who in a cold stormy Time, by wraping his
wet Cloak about his Neck, was taken with a Palsy in his Hand: And of another
who had a Palsy in three of his Fingers, occasioned by a Fall from his Chariot
upon his Back, whence he concluded that some part of the Nerves of the seventh
Vertebrae were hurt in their original; to which place applying the means (after
he had in vain opplyed Medicines to the Fingers) he completed a Cure.

19. The Signs of the Causes of a Paralysis, are drawn from the primary Causes,
the Diseases aforegoing, the Temperament and Habit of the Patient; and
therefore when external cold and moist Causes go before, as also old age, a
pituitous habit of Body, cold Weather, cold and moist Diet, or an Apoplexy has
preceeded they are Signs of a paralytick Disposition nere at hand.

20. Moreover a Catarrh long flowing and at length suddenly stopped, without
taking away the morbifick Matter, is a sign of an approaching Palsy; unless the
matter of the Catarrh, be suddenly conveyed some other way; for otherwise, it
commonly falls upon some noble Part; or diverts it lelf to the original of the
Nerves in the Brain; and of this Case, we have had two or three singular
Examples, all incurable.

CIII. Of the various Causes of a Paralysis or Palsy.

1. The general Causes of a Palsy, are all those which hinder the Passage of
the animal Spirit into the Nerves and Muscles; which by how many ways and by
what Artifice those hindrances are done, we shall in what follows more
particularly declare.

2. A Paralysis therefore happens when the animal Spirit does not sufficiently
invigorate or actuate the Nerves and their Ramifications, which is caused
either by an Obstruction of the Passages by which they should flow to the
respective Parts; or from the imbecility and paucity of the said Spirits,
whereby either their activity is hurt; or they are wanting, so as that the
Nerves can not be sufficiently repleat, or filled up therewith.

3. Hence the Variety of Palsies comes: from great and universal Obstructions,
a complete and perfect Palsy arises, in which both Motion and Sense are both
abolished: and this comes not only from the substance of the matter
obstructing, but also from a malign Quality, affecting even the Spirit it self;
this Obstruction of the Passages of the Spirits happens either in the first
Sensory, to wit, the streaked Bodies: or in or nere the medullar Trunks: Or in
the Nerves themselves, to wit, either in their beginnings, or middle, or ends,
viz, in the very Fibers themselves.

4. If the first Sensory, or spinal Marrow is affected; it either obstructs the
whole Spine, whence comes an universal Palsy below the original Obstuction: Or
one half thereof, whence comes a Palsy only on one Side: Or it obstructs the
original of the Nerves of some particular Co^jugation or Pair, either on one
Side alone, or on both at the same time, whence a Palsy is caused in this or
that particular Part or Member only.

5. Now these Obstuctions are made either 1. by a foreign Matter impacted in
them: Or 2. by Constipation and Compression, from matter abounding without
them, and that may be either from some particular Tumor, offending in
Magnitude, whereby the Nerves are constipated or compressed: Or from a large
Flux of Humors out of the Vessels, flowing upon and overpowering them: Or 3. by
solution of Unity by a Bruise or Wound: Or 4. and lastly, from the excess of
heat and cold; the Spirits being also in part wasted by the one, and (as it
were) congealed by the other.

6. An Obstruction in the first or common Sensory or streaked Bodies, causes
either a general Palsy, or a Palsy of one Side: And this is the chief Reason,
why suchlike Palsies follow upon an Apoplexy, Lethargy, or Carus; for that in
those Diseases the Conduits of the callous Body are at first affected; from
whence (upon the passing off of those Diseases,) there is many times a
Translation of the morbifick Matter into the marrowy Passages of one or more of
the Corpora striata; whence it is that the Afflux of the animal Spirit into the
Genus Nervosum is hindered, either in one or both Sides: And here if the
Obstructions be very great, Sense and Motion both are abolished; but if not,
the motive Faculty only suffers loss: And if it be but a very small Obstuction,
the motive Faculty has only been deprived or diminished, not taken away.

7. But why Sense should not be hurt as well as Motion in every Palsy, is
manifest as aforesaid, from the Magnitude of the Obstuction: For if the
Obstruction is truly so great, as to deprive any Member or Part totally of the
animal Spirit, then Sense and Motion both cease, for that they both are
performed and invigorated by the same Nerves and Fibers, within the same
marrowy Passages. But if the Obstruction is small, then a small Portion of the
animal Spirit is distributed, so much as may manage the sensitive Faculty; but
the motive is hurt, forasmuch as it can not be performed but by a larger
Proportion or Measure of the said Spirit.

8. Moreover a Palsy may be caused not only from the Obstructions of the
Corpora striata, but also from the Compression of the same, by Blood
extravasated within the inferior Cavity of the Brain, or a large quantity of
Lympha or serous Matter, lying upon the same and pressing them together, by
which means the medullary Conduits will be so straightned, as to hinder the
Afflux of the Spirit into the same.

9. But sometimes the morbifick Cause affects the oblong or spinal Marrow,
(though rarely by an Obstuction, yet sometimes) by Constipation and Compression,
and sometimes by a Solution of Continuity, whereby a Palsy is excited: Now
Obstructions are not here so easy to be made, for that the obstructing Matter
in the Head, does not easily fall beyond the Corpora striata; but the poisonous
Miasms may affect the Spirits, and so cause a kind of Paralysis, Hemiplegia, a
Numness, or depraved Operation of the Part or Parts.

10. But in either the oblong or spinal Marrow, especially the latter, a Palsy
may be excited from a Compression, or Solution of Continuity by a Bruise,
Apostume, or Wound, by means of which the Blood or serous Humor may flow within
the Hollowness or Chanel of the Spine, so as to straiten the spinal Marrow, and
stop up the Passage of the Spirit: And this may come to pass from a hurt of the
Vertebrae by Distortion, or Extremity of Cold in hard Weather; by the latter of
which a Congelation is sometimes bred, from whence paralytick Diseases sometimes
arise.

11. And if any of these Accidents seize upon any of the greater Nerves, or
their Ramifications, the same thing is caused; for that which is bitterness in
the Fountain, will be bitterness in the Streams also.

12. The Matter or Particles causing the Obstruction, descending from the
Cerebrum into the oblong Marrow, falling upon the beginning of the Nerves which
spread themselves into some of the Muscles of the Face, and by obstructing the
Passages of the Spirit, excite a Paralysis of the Tongue, Eyes, Eyelids, Lips,
Jaws, and other Parts: From whence the contrary Muscles being contracted, a
Cramp or Convulsion is stirred up in the opposite Part.

13. The same Particles being carried forth into the spinal Marrow, spreads it
self sometimes into all its Conjugations or Pairs; and sometimes into some
particular Nerves of the same, from whence a Palsy of all those Parts, into
which those Nerves or their Ramifications distribute themselves: And in all
those Parts whether in the Neck, Hands, Arms, Legs, or Feet, where a Paralysis
is caused from the Resolution of some particular Nerve or Nerves; if all the
Nerves of the same Part or Parts be not resolved, but the opposite Nerves be
free from the paralytick Affect, there is always a Contraction of the same, (as
in a particular Cure before-going we have observed.)

14. As the imbecility of the Animal Spirit often causes Paralytick Symptoms,
without any great Obstruction: so that imbecility or impotency may be caused by
an afflux of malign Particles, from Narcotick, stupefactive, or poisonous
Steams, whether internal or external, arising from Opium, or Opiates, the
Deadly Nightshade, Aconitum, Mercury, Antimony, Bismuth, Arsenick, etc. any of
which, if they kill not, yet many times induce paleness, weakness, tremblings,
and a relaxation or resolution of the Nerves and musculous parts. And the same
may be caused from the fumes of Aqua fortis, and Aqua regis, unadvisedly taken
up the Nostrils.

15. Such like malign Particles as these, whether proceeding from the aforesaid
Fountains, or from a scorbutic and cacochymick habit of Body, passing through
the brain and its medullar appendix, seize upon the nervous Conduits, and
thereby not only contaminate the Animal Spirit, but also the Neurotick juice,
whereby both the sense and the power of moving in a very short time comes to be
obliterated. These upon their first approaches only induce Paralytick Symptoms,
as stiffness, or numbness, and withal cause a weakness in the part; but at
length being plentifully cast into the Nerves, and as it were tumultuating
there, they fix themselves up and down, and so perfectly obstructing the
passages of the Spirit, cause an absolute and durable Palsy.

16. Galen, and many other Physicians, his followers affirm, a thick,
glutinous, cold phlegm to be the morbifick matter of a Paralysis; but such alike
substance is impossible to pass through the brain, much less the Neurotick
Cavities, by reason of their exceeding smallness: from whence it is manifest,
that the proeguminine, proximate, or conjunct cause of a Palsy is malign and
very subtle Atoms or Particles, which contaminating the Spirits, whether in the
Brain, callous, or streaked Bodies, the oblong or spinal Marrow, the original
of the Nerves, or their several and various ramifications, do infallibly excite
a Palsy, and in those part or parts which have a sympathy, consent, or
community with the parts first affected.

17. But that such thick, cold phlegm, or a watery humor in the Brain is not the
cause of the Palsy, is manifest; for that these humors commonly find another
vent, to wit, by the Nose, Eyes, and Pallat: And where there is a Dropsy of the
Brain, in which the Brain (says Willis) and the tops of either Marrow, do as
it were swim in Water, yet are not such for that reason disposed to the Palsy,
unless the Water by its weight make a compression of the Marrow.

18. The Procatartick, remote, or foregoing causes, remain now to be enquired
into, and they are either Accidental or Habitual. The Accidental are manifest,
as a Bruise, Wound, Luxation, and extreme heat or cold, without any previous or
habitual disposition of the Body, besides which, and the conjunct cause, which
is either a Compression, or Solution of Unity, there is no other.

19. The Procatartick habitual cause is always a malign extraneous matter,
generated and heaped up together, which being suffused into the Organs of sense
and motion, obstructs the marrowy of nervous passages, and sometimes withal
profligates the Spirit by mere contact, or effects both together, whence by
reason of the cutting off of the Animal Spirit a Palsy is excited in the
congruent parts.

20. This cause depends upon a double antecedent cause, viz. one more remote;
which is a disaffection of the Blood and Lymphatick juice, generated in
themselves, or taken from the Stomach, Intestines and Mesentery, which conveys
to the Head a morbifick matter: the other more near, which is a brain of evil
disposition or conformation, being either too weak, or too loose and resolved;
or otherwise of evil conformation, whereby it easily admits of foreign,
heterogene and malign Particles.

21. The morbifick matter being brought to the Brain induces a Paralysis either
primarily, for that those heterogene and malign Particles are chiefly disposed
for the exciting or stirring up a Palsy: And with all, that they are conveyed
gradually, and in small proportion: for otherwise, should there be a great
afflux together, they would first cause an Apoplexy or Carus, or excite
Convulsions, the Cholick, Gout, or Scorbute, and then at length a Palsy. Or
Secondarily, which is most common, after some of the aforenamed Diseases, a
slow and long Fever, immoderate Grief, a Consumption, Atrophy, or Wasting, and
some other Distempers for the most part Chronical; wherein the natural and
vital Faculties being thereby very much hurt, and the strength at length worn
out, enervations and resolutions of the whole Body, or of some Members,
oftentimes succeeds.

22. A Palsy for most part follows after long and continued Convulsions, or
convulsive Motions, as Epilepsies; for that the Nerves and Muscles in several
Members are mightily debilitated, so that the motive Faculty is as it were,
only through infinite weakness, abolished, the sick becoming first Lame, then
wholly helpless; for that the morbifick matter, being continually thrust into
the passages of the Cerebrum, and its medullar, and nervous Appendix does at
length so weaken and dilate them, that it gives a free course to those malign
and heterogene Particles by which the Palsy is certainly induced.

23. So also after a frequent and long Cholick, which cruelly tormenting, and
returning by intervals, causes other cruel, and almost continual pains in the
other Viscera of the Abdomen; from whence (through the subtilty of the matter)
is excited wandering pains through the Body, and its Members, which causes
first infinite weakness, then a Stapor, or Numness, and at last a Resolution,
or Palsy of the parts afflicted; for that the seat of the morbifick matter, or
Particles is now changed being transfused into the Splanchnick N^rves, which
pulling and twitching the Fibers of the Viscera, stirs up Pains and
Convulsions; then becoming more plentiful, diffuse themselves through the
Spinal Marrow, where entering into the Nerves, destinated to such respective
parts, forthwith induces as aforesaid, a Resolution, or Palsy.

24. In like manner, after a frequent and vehement Gout, a Palsy may be
excited, from the infinite weakening of the Nerves and Muscles (through the
extreme anguish and misery of the part) for thereby, at length voluntary motion
comes to be abolished: but not for that cause only, but from a more inward
cause inherent in the Cavities of the Nerves themselves; for that the Neurotick
juice by the heat and inflammation of the Disease afflicting is rarefied, and
forced out of its own domicil into the hollows of the Nerves, where interfering
with the Animal Spirit, not only exasperates the pain, whereby the part comes
to be weakened, but also obstructs the future occurse of the said Spirit to the
same place: besides which, it is also possible, that the gouty Particles
transfusing themselves into the mass of Blood, with which being carried to the
Brain, and being continually multiplied by manifold accessions, may at length
contaminate the Spirits in the Callous and streaked Bodies, oblong and spinal
Marrow, and in the original of the Nerves of several conjugations or pairs, and
their several and various ramifications, so as to induce an absolute and
confirmed Palsy.

25. There is another species of this Disease, wherein the motive Faculty is
not abolished, but only weakly performed, or depraved. This is caused either
from the want or impotency of the Animal Spirit, whereby the Members cannot
strongly move, or lift, or bear any weight, but they labor under a great
debility and trembling: for a sufficient strength being wanting for the
performance of any act at one essay, Nature submitting, is forced to act by a
more often repeated endeavor, and so the part being in motion, is forced to
shake and tremble; whence it is, that in some palsied people, there is always a
trembling and shaking in all their Limbs, for that the nervous Fibers are
universally weakened, which continually striving to exert their wonted power
reiterate those depraved motions perpetually.

26. Those who suffer a Palsy through a defect of the Animal Spirit, are such
as have lost much Blood; or, such as have too often exercised the Venerial Act;
or are arrived to an extreme or unhealthy old Age; for by these means the
Spirits are wasted, and the supply or stock and provision of them being but
small, their dispensation into the Genus Nervosum is so much diminished, that a
trembling Paralysis commonly succeeds thereupon.

27. The same thing almost happens to such as have lain long sick in an
Atrophy, or wasting condition, and some other chronical Diseases, in which the
Spirits wast or decay, and the Vigor, force or strength of the Body, gradatim,
and as it were, insensibly declines, whereby they become so enervated, as that
they can neither go nor stand upright, much less perform any other action,
which requires any considerable power: these sometimes lie Bedridden long, and it
may be without any considerable sickness; and although they seem every day, as
if they were ready to die, yet they lie easily quietly, and undisturbed, talk
cheerfully, but dare not rise or move; for that upon the least motion, such a
signal uneasiness and weariness seises upon them as if they had don some hard
labor, or gone some great journey, so that they cannot be rested again in some
hours after: In this case certainly, although the Animal Spirits do in some
sort inliven and actuate the Genus Nervosum, yet the due measure is so small,
and their proportion to the whole so defective, that the power of moving
(though not wholly taken away, yet) is so depraved, that the sick can scarcely
be persuaded to try whether they can move or not.

28. And almost for the same reason the Motive faculty, fails or is depraved in
Scorbutic Persons, and such as have often Surfeited themselves with Gluttony,
and strong liquors, whereby such a superfluous quantity of ill humors, and
indigested matter is generated, that thereby even the Spirits themselves are
contaminated, and at long run almost overwhelmed; whereby, they are either made
imbecil, impotent or weak; or the Spirit making faculty (from the impotency of
the Stomach and the other Viscera) though not wholly ceasing to perform its
duty, yet does it so poorly and meanly, that there is not a sufficient
generation of Spirits daily made, to support the humane frame in its due energy
and strength. For by these means the whole Sanguinous mass becomes polluted,
and filled with impurities and serosities, which being therewith conveyed to
the Brain, (made lax or loose as to its Pores, by a long continuation of
irregularities) is easiely received there; out of which impure Blood, as there
is a less proportion of Animal Spirits generated, so are they not so sublime,
serene, or subtle, but more dull or cloudy (by reason of the adhesion of the
impure matter) whereby they become incapable of exerting in themselves the
motive faculty.

29. And in these cases arising from the defect, or imbecility of the Animal
Spirit, we conclude the Spirits not only to be in fault, but the Organs also
generating and containing them, made weak by the depraved Serosities or Gas of
the Blood, transmitted every where through the whole universal Body into the
moving Fibers; whereby it is reasonable to think, that those few Spirits
(impure also) derived from the Brain, being disposed at length through the
whole Genus Nervosum, into the minutest Fibers, and meeting there, with that
depraved Serositie, or malign Gas of the Blood, make the motive Faculty both
more weak and trembling.

30. And therefore as to an habitual Palsy, or a Palsy generated from a
previous long and habitual vicious course of Living; this we say, that
whatsoever things do more than ordinarily vitiate the Blood; or, obstruct the
Brain and its nervous Appendix, excite an afflux of morbifick Particles, or
matter; produce a Narcosis, or stupefaction of the Spirits; or, impeeds their
generating, may be accounted as antecedent causes of a Paralysis. In order to
the producing of these causes, are the disorders of the six Non-naturals,
insatiable eating, immeasurable drinking Wine, or other strong Liquors, an idle
and sedentary course of Life, sleeping too much or unseasonably, immoderate use
of Venus, too much loss of Blood, too vehement evacuations either by Vomit or
Stool, a cold and moist Air, Metalick and Narcotick Fumes, stupefying
Medicines, excess of heat, cold, or moisture, vehement and long Passions of the
Mind, etc.

31. Hitherto of a Paralysis, where motion is only hurt, the sense remaining
firm; it is now reasonable, that we show the cause of sense being hurt, the
motive faculty being sound and strong, as is ordinary in such as are afflicted
with an Elephantiasis, Lepra Graecorum, and Mania, who often go naked, lie cold
in Frost and Snow, or the middle of Winter, and whose Skins are so numb and
senseless, that they feel not, though pricked with Auls, Needles, or Pins, or cut
with Knives, etc. The true reason of this is, because the Nerves replenishing
the Skin, (the outer and primary Organ of feeling) and the Membranes covering
the Muscles by their various Ramifications and innumerable membranaceous Fibers
(which chiefly convey to the parts, the sense of feeling) are only hurt, or
chiefly suffer: Whereas those greater Tendinous and Muscular Nerves, who by
their musculous and fleshy Fibers exert the motive faculty; or, in whom is
seated the power of moving, remain safe and unhurt. Wherefore the loss or hurt
of the sensitive faculty, proceeds from a hurt of the exterior and
membranaceous Fibers, either through some poisonous or malign Gas: or,
extremity of cold benumbing them, so that the Animal Spirit cannot (as it ought
to do) irradiate them: and hence it appears, that the Nerves of the exterior
Membranes are only hurt, for that sense being lost, the part or parts wast not,
as when deprived of motion, but have a sufficient afflux of the Animal Spirit,
enabling them to perform their proper duty, and to assimulate the nutritions
juice brought to the said parts, by the Arteries.

32. Now out of what has been already said it appears, that the extremest kind
of Palsy, in which the motive and sensitive Faculties are both hurt or
abolished, is caused from a general affection of all the Nerves distributed
into the part or parts affected, as well the Cutaneous and Membranaceous Fibers
of the Nerves, as the Tendinous and Muscular, whereby the Tracts, or passages
and ways of the Animal Spirit are (in a manner) completely shut up, and all its
irradiations intercepted or frustrated: This may chance (though rarely) from
the descent of the morbifick matter from the Brain, into the oblong Morrow; but
very often from a notable hurt of the Backbone, by a Blow, Wound, or Fall from
some high place, whereby (the Spinae Medulla being compressed, or too much
distended, or writhed) the passages of the Animal Spirit are mightily
obstructed, and in danger of perfect obliteration.

CIV. The Judgments or Prognostics of the Palsy.

1. A Palsy coming from a cold and moist Cause, or in a cold and moist habit of
body, especially in such as are extreme Fat, and have been so of a long time,
is very difficultly cured: and if the Disease in such a person, has been of any
long continuance, it seldom or never is cured.

2. The cure is difficult, or seldom or never performed, if the Disease happens
in old Age, more especially if the Sick is Fat, and of a cold moist habit of
body.

3. A Palsy wherein motion is abolished, is much more difficult to Cure, than
that in which sense is only hurt; in regard of the deep situation of the
Nerves, for that the force of the Medicine cannot so easily reach them: but
that Palsy, wherein both Faculties are hurt or abolished, is yet much worse.

4. Every Paralysis whither coming by degrees, or happening by accident,
whether universal or particular, though for the most part they are free from
imminent danger, yet they are long in curing.

5. A Palsy coming after an Apoplexy, is seldom cured, and many times returns
into an Apoplexy again, by a new afflux of like matter into the Brain, which is
made lax and weak by the former Disease.

6. If it comes from a Blow, Fall, Wound, etc. or upon an Apoplexy, Lethargy,
Carus, Convulsion, Cholick, Gout, or other affects of the Brain, or Genus
Nervosum, it will not quickly be cured, or so much as easily give place to
Medicines, but for the most part remains uncurable.

7. A Tremor, or Trembling, coming upon or after a Palsy, is said to be
healthful; for that the passages of the Nerves begin somewhat to open
themselves, to make way for the Animal Spirit, whereby Motion (though at first
after a trembling manner) begins to be restored.

8. If the Paralytick retains an actual native heat in it, there is hope of
Recovery; but if it is always cold, and cannot be induced to retain a natural
heat, the Case is desperate.

9. If a total resolution follows upon a general obstruction of the original of
the oblong Marrow, or the Spina dorsi, being extremely hurt, and that thereby
both sense and motion are both taken away, the Disease will scarcely admit of
any cure.

10. An Atrophy, or want of Nourishment in the paralytick part, with great
paleness, takes away all hopes of a Cure: For it not only signifies an
impotency and decay of the Animal Spirit, but shows great danger of the
extinction of the native heat.

11. A Palsy happening in the Winter is cured with much more difficulty than
that which happens in the Spring or Summer; more especially if it happens in
cold and moist Constitutions, and in Aged people.

12. They who are once cured of a Palsy, proceeding from an evident solitary
Cause, do not so easily Relapse into the same, as they who are cured of it
arising from a Procatartick cause: This seems to be Truth from the very reason
of the thing, and nature of the Causes.

13. If the Ey on that side on which the Palsy happens, be hurt thereby; there
is but little hopes of a Cure; for it argues a great defect or want of Animal
Spirits in the part or parts affected.

14. A Palsy happening to Scorbutical, or Cacochymical, and very intemperate or
surfeited Persons (although otherwise of a strong body) though the Distemper be
not very great, yet will it be with much labor and difficulty cured.

15. A Palsy in the Legs and Feet, is more easily cured than that in the upper
parts, because those Nerves are harder and stronger.

16. A strong Fever coming upon a Palsy, is healthful; for the extreme heat
thereof Rarifies, and consumes, or expels the morbifick matter: and partly for
the same reason, a Diarrhoea, or Looseness coming upon a recent and weak Palsy,
foreshews speedy Recovery; for says Rhasis, I have seen many Paralyticks cured
by a Diarrhoea.

CV. The general method of curing the Idopathetick Palsy.

1. We now come to the Therapeutical Considerations of the Palsy; and first of
an Idopathetick Palsy, excited from a Procatartick cause, or previous
disposition of the body to such an indisposition: wherein we are chiefly to
endeavor the alteration of the habit of the body, by rectifying the Discrasy
of the Blood: then to take away the morbifick matter offending; and lastly so
to strengthen the parts hurt, that they may for the future be able to resist
all other assaults of the Disease.

2. The Palsy may happen in a hot or cold Constitution, and therefore you are
first wisely and prudently to consider the Temperament of the Sick; for if you
adhibit hot things in a hot Constitution; or cold in a cold habit, you will but
exasperate the Disease, and make it so much the more difficult to be cured. Now
whereas a Paralysis in a cold and moist habit of body is most usual, and
frequent; we shall first lay down a method of Precepts for the Cure thereof.

3. Here then since the Disease arose from a long Series of prepared matter,
and Paralytick Particles begotten in the Blood from a cold and moist external
cause: this habit must be altered by a long course of a proper Diet, which
entering into the Sanguinous mass may in length of time, and by degrees (as the
Disease came) remove the Discrasy, which continually hitherto has breed those
heaps of Paralytick Particles.

4. For this purpose we commend a Guajacum Diet, which you may make after this
manner: Take Guajacum rasped, twelve ounces: Sarsa parilla, Sassafras rasped,
Juniper berries well bruised, white and yellow Sanders, of each six ounces:
crude Antimony in powder tied up in a rag, eight ounces: boil all after due
infusion in twelve quarts of spring water till near half be consumed: then add
Carraways, Coriander seeds, Rosmary, Sage, Savory, Pennyroyal, sweet Marjoram,
Galangal, florentine Orrice-root bruised, of each two ounces and half: Raisons
of the sun, stoned, a pound: boil all gently, according to Art; strain the
Decoction, and to every quart thereof add choice Sherry Wine, half a pint: then
dulcify it moderately with double refined Sugar, and Bottle it up with a Clove
slit in each Bottle, and let it be kept for ordinary Drink. Let this be drunk
during the whole course of the Cure; but Morning and Evening drop into the same
twenty, thirty, or forty drops of the Spirit of Man's Blood, Spirit of
Hartshorn, or of Skulls, of Soot, of Amber, of Sal Armoniack, or some such
like, which by their operative quality, give a more speedy inlet-into the Genus
Nervosum.

5. Those who cannot take the former Diet may take this: Take new Ale, four
gallons, White Wind, four quarts: Juice of Scurvy Grass, three pints: Juyces of
Tarragon, of Watercresses, and of Brooklime, of each one pint: shavings of
Horseradish Roots, Mustard Seed, bruised, of each four ounces and a half: put
these into a bag, and mixing them all together; let them work up with the Ale
for a day or two, or till the fermentation is over: which done, after five or
six days, bottle up the clear Liquor, with a Clove slit in each Bottle, and an
ounce of pure white sugar. Let the Sick drink of this as their ordinary Liquor,
save in the Morning fasting, and last at Night going to bed, a Dose of the
aforenamed Spirits may constantly be dropped into it.

6. But because some cannot take things unless they be grateful to the Palate;
a compound sort of Hydromel or Mead, may be made very effectual, which may be
drunk sometimes before Meat, or otherwise as the Sick has occasion; and it may
be thus made: Take spring water, ten quarts: Honey, two pound: roots of Acorus
and of Orrice, dried, Sage and Rosmary, of each two ounces and a half: boil
them to a consumption of a third part, and in the end Aromatize it with
Cinnamon, half an ounce: Nutmegs, two drams: Pepper, half a dram: make a
Melicrate according to Art. This may be done after the same manner (for want of
Honey) with Sugar. To this Mead you may add Staechas, and Lavender-flowers, of
each an ounce; if you so please.

7. Or this following Decoction may be given instead thereof: Take roots of the
true Acorus, Orrice, of each an ounce: Cyperus, Elecampane, Zedoary, of each
half an ounce: Rosemary, Sage, Marjoram, Time, Pennyroyal, Ground Pine, of
each one handful: Hysop, Betony, Calamint, herb Mastich, of each half a
handful: the flowers of Lavender, of Rosmary, Staechas, Camomil, of each one
pugil: seeds of Anise, Fennel, Carraways, Rue, of each two drams: Liquorice
bruised, one ounce: Raisons of the sun, stoned, four ounces: make a Decoction
in Water, adding at the end of boiling, a quarter part of Wine; dulcifie it
with Honey or Sugar, and Aromatize it with Cinnamon, or with some Aromatical
Powder, then bottle it up for ordinary drink.

8. Or the Sick may take this distilled Water of Willis his design: Take leaves
or roots of Aron, one pound: leaves of Garden Scurvy grass, of the greater
Rocket, of Rosmary, Sage, Savory, Time, of each four handfuls: of the flowers
of Lavender, three handfuls: the outward Rinds of ten Oranges and six Limons:
Winteran bark, three ounces: Roots of the lesser Galangal, Calamus Aromaticus,
Florentine Orrice, of each two ounces: Cubebs, Cloves, Nutmegs, of each two
ounces: all being cut and bruised pour to them of white Wine, and of Brumswick
Beer or Mum, of each two quarts: distill it in common Organs, to dryness, (but
with great caution that it burn not,) and let all the Liquor be mixed together.

9. Riverius commends this following Water: Take the Chips of Guajacum, four
ounces: Bark of the same, one ounce: Sarsa parilla, one ounce and half:
China-root, one ounce: Sassafras, six drams: Lignum Aloes, Galangal, of each
one dram and half: roots of Angelica, Peony, and Fennel, of each three drams
and half: Peony seeds, two drams: infuse them all in Water, twelve quarts: and
Wine, two quarts for four and twenty hours. After add the leaves of Betony,
Ivy, and Sage, of each one handful: Flowers of the Tile-Tree, of Primroses, of
Stechas, and of Rosemary, of each two pugils: of Lavender, one pugil: old
Treacle, half an ounce: Citron-Peels, and Seeds, of each three drams and half:
Polypody, half an ounce: Cinnamon, six drams: distill them in Balneo Mariae
according to Art, and to every two pints and half of the Liquor, put of Manus
Christi prepared with Oil of Cinnamon, four ounces: Dose four ounces in the
Morning fasting, and as much at bedtime.

10. Infusions, especially those made in Wine do good, for though Wine,
especially if it be strong and too liberally taken is no ways convenient, yet
drawing into its Body other things, and being to them as it were a Vehicle,
whereby their Virtues are conveyed to the Nerves, they become profitable, being
thus made Medicinal. You may prepare a simple Infusion after this manner: Take
roots of Acorus, two ounces: Raspings of Guajacum, twelve ounces: leaves of
dried Sage and Rosmary, of each one ounce and half: Ground Pine, sweet
Marjoram, musked Cranes-Bill, Nutmegs, of each one ounce: Wormwood, Zedoary, of
each half an ounce: White, or Rhenish, or Sherry Wine, ten quarts: make an
Infusion in a gentle Balneo for a Week, then strain, filter, and dulcifie it
with double refined Sugar. Give it alone, or with Cinnamon Water.

11. But while these things are doing, we must not be unmindful to remove (as
much as may be) the morbifick Cause, which is done by convenient Evacuations
either upwards, or downwards, or both ways, and by the other ordinary ways of
Revulsion and Derivation: But Authors advise, that at first, gentle
Evacuations, and them but rarely are to be adhibited, (because the Nervous
parts are apt to be made more imbecil or weak, by strong and reiterated
Purgations:) but Riverius says, that it is good to give a purging Drink
fifteen days beforehand, that all the load of crude humors may be the better
cast out for so the Relics afterward will be the more easily discussed by
the habit of the Body.

12. For that purpose he prescribes this: Take Raspings of Guajacum, three
ounces: Bark of the same one ounce: spring water, two quarts: Infuse them warm
twenty four hours: then let them boil to the consumption of half; adding at the
end choice Alexandrian Sena, one ounce: Turbith, Hermodacts, of each two drams:
infuse gently for twelve hours, then strain out: Dose half a pint every Morning
for fifteen days, not Sweating.

13. If the Stomach be foul, and nothing oppose, a Vomit may be first given,
made of Sal Vitrioli, or of the Sulphur of Antimony, the Emetick Tartar of
Mynsicht, or an Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, or of Vitrum Antimonij, or
Mercurius Vitae: Or, if the Body be weak, it may be prepared of Gutta Gambae,
Infusion of Esulae, and such like: a day or two after the Emetick is taken, you
may purge with Pilulae Ruffi, Pilulae Aloephanginae, Cochiae, or our Family
Pills, which are inferior to no other purging Pills whatsoever. Some commend
Aloephanginae, given with Resin of Jallap once a Week, and doubtless it may (if
wisely given) be very profitable for the Intention. This is commended by
Sennertus: Take Pilulae Assajereth, one dram: Pilulae Mastich, one scruple:
with syrup of Stoechas simple, or Oxymel of squils, make it up into Pills: Or
you may mix Assajereth with Aloephangine. D^se one dram at a time.

14. Pl^terus commends this: Take Pilulae Assajereth, two dram: of
Aloephanginae, one dram and half: of Agarick, Rhubarb, of each one dram:
Mastich, half a dram: Sal Gem, one scruple: Castereum, half a scruple; with
syrup of Stoechas, make a Mass: Dose one scruple to half a dram by course. Or,
Take Turpentine, half an ounce: make it up into Pills with Species Hiera: or,
if liquid things be most desired, you may open the body of the Turpentine with
the yolk of an Egg, then dissolve it in Ground pine-water, and dulcifie it with
Honey. For Turpentine is an appropriate, purging and singular remedy for the
Palsy, being given often and long, for it carries off the very Essence of the
Disease not only by Stool, but by Urine too.

15. But the fifteenth day being over, the opinion of Physicians is, that we
must come to the use of stronger Purges, such as these following: Take Pilulae
Foetidae, Cochiae, of each one scruple: Opopanax, half a scruple: with syrup of
Stoechas, make Pills: If they work not so much as you would have them, you may
quicken them with five grains of the Troches Alhandal.

16. You may also Purge with Pilulae de Agarico, Cochiae, Foetidae, de
Hermodactylis, de Sagapeno, de Opopanace, Turbith, Colocynthis, Elect. Indum,
Benedicta Laxativa, Hieracum Agarico, Hiera Logadij, Hiera Pacchij, and others
of like kind: one dram of the Pills of Ground Pine are given with great
success: you may make them according to Sennertus as follows.

17. Pilulae de Iva Arthretica: Take Gout-Ivy, Cowslips, flowers of Arabian
Stoechas, and of Rosmary, of each one dram (being dried and in powder:) choice
Turbith, a dram and half: white Agarick, two drams: Colocynthis, half a dram:
Castoreum, Ginger, Sal Gem, of each ten grains: the best Rubarb, one dram and
half: Indian spicknard, eight grains: species Hiera simple of Galen, half an
ounce: Diagrydium, one dram: Opopanax, half a dram: all being finely poudred,
with fresh juice of Gout-Ivy, or Ground Pine boiled like an Extract, and the
Oils of Marjoram and Rosmary, of each five drops: make a mass of Pills. Let
them be given several days together; some say, an hour after Su^per: but
Sennertus advises, rather in the Morning fasting: but my advise is, that if the
Body be difficult to work upon, that then they ought to be given over Night.
Matthiolus commends them, and Benedictus Victor calls them a glorious help.

18. Take Pilulae Faetidae Mesuae, or which are yet stronger, of Rhasis, two
scruples: de Opopanace, one scruple: Castor, five grains: with syrup of Betony,
or Hysop, make twenty one Pills: which repeat as often as need requires. Or
this: Take Agarick trochiscated, two drams: Turbith, one dram: Sal Gem, Ginger,
of each one scruple: Castoreum, half a scruple: Hiera Diacolocynthid. one dram:
make a mass of Pills: the Dose one dram. Or thus, Take Pilulae saetidae, two
scruples and half: Agarick troch scaled, one scruple: Troches Alhandal, five
grains: Castoreum, four grains: with Honey of squils, make Pills.

19. Those who cannot take Pills may take the following Potion: Take roots of
Fennel and Peony, of each half an ounce: florentine Orrice, Calamus Aromaticus,
of each two drams: Fennel-seed, a dram and half: Bay and Juniper Berries,
Cubebs, of each two drams: Betony, Cowslip-leaves, Sage, Gout-Ivy or
Ground Pine, Rosmary, flowers of Arabian Staechas, of each one pugil: choice
Sena, an ounce and half: white Agarick, half an ounce: Mechoacan, two drams:
Ginger, one dram and half: Cinnamon, Mastich, of each one dram: Infuse all in a
sufficient quantity of Hydromel; being sufficiently infused strain, of which
straining take ten ounces: syrup of Staechas simple, two ounces: syrup of
Hysop, one ounce: mix them together, and let it be given in the Morning fasting
for three days.

20. Or thus: Take Primrose-flower-water, White or Rhenish Wine, of each a
quart: Rosemary-flowers, Lavenders-flowers, Staechas, of each two ounces:
infuse them in a warn Balneo for twenty four hours; then press them strongly
out with a press: to the straining put rectified Oil of Vitriol, two drams: and
shake them well together, after add, choice Sena, four ounces: white and gummy
Turbith, Hermodactyls, of each an ounce and half: Cortex Guajaci, one ounce:

Ginger, a dram and half: Sal Gem, half a dram: Lastly dulcify with double
refined Sugar half a pound, boiling to the consistency of a Syrup: Dose two
ounces or more.

25. An Electuary: Take Electuarium Diaphaenicon the greater; Electuarium
Indum, Tables of Citrons solutive, of each one ounce: Tables of Diacarthamum,
six drams: Species Hiera of Colocynthis, three drams: Mastick, Opopanax,
Sagapenum, of each half a dram: Nutmeg, Ginger, Cinnamon, Cloves, of each one
dram: with Syrup of Ground Pine, or of Stoechas, make an Electuary. Dose from
two drams to four.

26. We have hitherto only showed you the tedious and troublesome Prescripts of
Authors: We will now show you one or two peculiar and select Recipes of our
own, and so conclude this Topic of Purging. The first shall be a Potion: Take
small Cinnamon Water, a quart: of the best Alexandrian Sena, four ounces:
choice Rubarb thin sliced, one ounce: infuse twenty four hours in a warm
Balneo: then gently strain out: Dose four, five, or six spoonfuls, according to
Age and Strength: in every Dose as it is taken put Powers of Rosmary, of
Lavender, of Cloves, and of Carraways, of each one dram or more. The other is
Pills: Take of the best Venice Turpentine, four ounces: and make it up into
Pills without boiling by adding thereto the pouders of Zedoary, Bay berries,
Ginger, choice Rubarb, Scammony, of each equal quantities, beating them very
well together in a Mortar, adding a little Sugar. Dose from half a dram to two
or more, according to Age, Strength, and the Constitution of the Body.

27. These two last are experimented Specific Antiparylitick Catharticks, and
if wisely and orderly given, as Nature will admit, and the Disease requires,
will do wonders in the cure of a Paralysis; And it is certain, that Turpentine
is one of the greatest Specificks in the Cure of a Palsy and the Scorbute that
is, it transcending indeed all other Medicaments; but it ought to be constantly
and long given, and with those advantages, that it may not nauseat the Stomach;
so taken it becomes a perfect Balsam, cleanses the whole Body of all
impurities, mundifies the whole mass of Blood, heals all inward Bruises,
Wounds, Ulcers, or Excoriations, whether in the Bowels, or Lungs; and otherwise
restores decayed Nature to a Miracle, carrying off all its Faeculencies by
urine and stool.

28. Now these Purgers ought to be repeated by course if the Disease continues,
especially if there be great plenty of evil Humors, as in a more general Palsy:
For in this Case there ought to be reiterated Purgation, at due intervals of
time, which you may perform with the two things, (one or both of them as you
think most convenient) now last mentioned; intermitting sometimes a day, two or
three, and repeating the Purge again. But you must be very cautious of Vomits,
especially of such as are very strong, as in Stibium, by the use of which it
has been several times observed that the Patient has become presently palfied,
who was not so before. Therefore Vomits are not be given unless there be a
previous lothing or apness to Vomit, or exceeding foulness of Stomach; or that
the Patient be accustmed to that way of Evacuation, or vomits easily, otherwise
the Violence of the Vomit does as it were enervate the whole Body, and so
(instead of weakening) strengthen the Disease.

29. If the Body be bound, before Purging you ought to give an emollient
Clyster, that the Body may be in some measure prepared for the succeeding
Purge, by which means, it will also work with so much the more ease. You may
make it thus: Take roots of Lillies, two ounces: Mallows, Beets, or Mercury,
Sage, Rue, Hysop, Origanum, Ground Pine, of each one handful: flowers of
Camomil, Lavender, of each one pugil: Carraway-seeds, two drams: Bay Berries,
one ounce: Wheat-bran, one pugil: make a Decoction adding a little Lie: strain,
and dissolve therein Honey, one ounce and half: Oil Olive, half an ounce: Hiera
Galeni, two drams: Salt, half a dram: mix, and ma^^ a Clyster.

30. Or thus: Take juice of Beets, or Mercury, two ounces: juyces of Rue and
Hysop, of each one ounce: Honey, two ounces: Oil of Nuts or Butter, two ounces:
salt Broth, or Decoction of Sage, or Boys urine, eight or ten ounces: mix and
make a Clyster. This is easier and as good: Take fat Broth or Milk, a pint:
Honey, sweet Oil, of each two ounces: Powers of Aniseeds, half an ounce: mix
them for a Clyster, and let it be exhibited warm. Or thus: Take Milk, a pint
syrup of Violets, Oil of Roses, of each two ounces and a half: Powers of
Carraways, and of Aniseeds, of each three drams: mix them for a Clyster, and
put it up warm.

31. Sennertus prescribes this Clyster: Take herb Mercury, Beets, Sage, Hyssop,
Origanum, Betony, of each one handful: flowers of Cammomil, tops of Centory the
less, of each half a handful: seeds of Rue and Fennel, of each one dram and
half: white Agarick, two drams: boil them in a sufficient quantity of Water:
Take of that strained decoction, a pint: in which dissolve the Electuary Hiera
cum Agarico, Benedicta laxativa, of each six drams: Oils of Cammomil, white
Lillys, and of Rue, Honey of Roses strained, of each one ounce: Salt, half a
dram: mix and make a Clyster.

32. Another for the same purpose: Take Bryony-roots, six drams: leaves of
Sage, Gout-Ivy, Centory the less, Herb Mercury, of each one handful: flowers of
Cowslips, Origanum, Rue, of each half a pugil: Arabian Staechas, one pugil:
seeds of Siler Montanus: one dram and half: Carthamus seed, one ounce:
Colocynthis, one dram: make a decoction in a sufficient quantity of water. Take
of that decoction strained, one pint: in which dissolve Electuar. Diaphenicum,
half an ounce: Hiera Diacolycynthid, 3 drams: Oils of Castor and Rue, of each
one ounce: Sal Gem, one scruple: mix them for a Clyster.

33. If purging seems not sufficiently to carry of the conjoined cause, but
that great quantities of gross and crude humors offend the Head, you must
endeavor to evacuate them by Masticatories, Gargarisms, Errhines,
Sternutatories, and such like; for that they draw forth pitui^^ us and watery
humors, and also both dry and alter; and in a Paralysis they empty from the
Head, and make Revulsion from the original of the Nerves, being held for
excellent Remedies.

34. A Masticatory: Take Nutmegs, two drams: P^llitory of Spain, Mustard seed,
of each one dram and half: Cubebs, Pepper, Galangal, roots of Angelica, of each
half a dram: Mastich, one dram: Wax, a little: mix and make Masticatories. If a
little Castoreum be added (so the fick dislikes not the smell of it) it will be
much more effectual.

35. A Gargarism: Take roots of Angelica, Pellitory of Spain, the true Acorus,
of each half a dram: leaves of Sage, Marjoram, Time, Hyssop, Origanum, of each
one handful: Mustard Seed, two drams: Staves-acre, long Pepper, of each one
dram: Nutmegs, half an ounce: make a Decoction in Water; and adding Honey of
Squils, or of Rosemary, mix them well, and make a Gargle to wash the Mouth and
Throat withal. If the Sick can keep from Swallowing of it, there may be added,
Carthamus-seeds, six drams: Turbith, half an ounce: otherwise they must be
omitted.

36. A liquid Errhine: Take juices of Beetroots, and of Pimpernel with the
purple-flower, of each one ounce: juyces of sweet Marjoram, and of Rue, of each
half an ounce: seeds of Gith, root of Pyrethrum, of each half a dram:
Castoreum, half a scruple: Honey of squills, half an ounce: Wine, one ounce:
mix and make an Errhine. This being drawn up into the Nostrils; or the Sick
lying on his back, being distilled into them by drops, does powerfully provoke
phlegm and watery humors, and draw them away. But a more powerful one is this:
Take White or Rhenish Wine, four ounces: dissolve therein Euphorbium, a
scruple: and use it as the former; it is of admirable effects.

37. Another for the same purpose: Take juyces of Sowbread and Pimpernel, of
each two drams: juice of sweet Marjoram, one dram: Troches Alhandal, one
scruple: Pellitory of Spain, seeds of Gith, of each half a dram: Castoreum,
half a scruple: Honey Acardine, a sufficient quantity: mix them together; with
which bosmear the insides of the Nostrils.

38. A Sternutatory: Take of the root of Pyrethrum, Gith-seeds, of each half a
dram: the best Spanish Tobacco, three drams: Castoreum, a scruple: Euphorbium,
ten grains: make each into a most fine powder; then mix them together: this may
be sometimes blowed up into the Nostrils. Or thus: Take choice Spanish Tobacco,
half an ounce: roots of white Hellebor, Musk, Ambergrise, of each a dram: make
each into a fine powder, then mix them to be used as the former.

39. If all these things do no good, we must come to more general Remedies, the
chief of which are Sudorificks, or sweating Medicines; then Diuretics;
Vomitories; lastly, Mercurial Medicines, producing Salivation or Spitting; each
of which we shall touch concisely in order: but these indeed ought not to be
attempted, till all other Remedies both internal and external have been long
used in vain.

40. How Sweating contributes to the Cure of Paralyticks of a cold and moist
habit of Body, we now come to show: (but manifold Experience, against which
there is no Argument, has proved it very pernicious in hot, dry, and choleric
Constitutions: and such instead of being helped by it, have received much harm,
the morbifick Matter being thereby made the more outrageous, and the Disease
sometimes so fixed, as to become incurable.) Now Sweating in a cold and humid
Constitution, rarifying all the Humidities of the Body, and opening its Pores,
does thereby in a great measure send forth and exterminate the Impurities and
Faeculencies of the Blood and nervous Juice: so that the morbifick Matter thus
breathing forth, does not any more flow into the Brain and Parts affected; and
that which has already proceeded therefrom, in thus going forth and passing
also out of the Pores of the Nerves, before obstructed, opens those porous
Passages, whereby a clearer way is made for the afflux of the animal Spirit.

41. Now that a plentiful Diaphoresis or Sweating may be procured, Medicines
both internal and external are commonly made use it: By the former, either the
Blood or its Serum, or both, are excited into an heat, or the Heart forced into
most swift Motions, whereby the sanguinous Mass being more rapidly or hastily
circulated through the Heart and Vessels, and so brought into a kind of
Fermentation, many of its serous and noxious Effluvia's, which are partly the
morbifick Matter, and the Matter also of the Sweat, are sent hastily forth.
Hereby (says Platerus) the Humors are drawn forth by insensible Transpiration,
or manifest Sweats, and do wast from the Part affected, the conjunct and
antecedent Cause, and oftentimes is the prime Remedy in curing this long
continued Disease.

42. Sweat (says Sennertus) is provoked by a Decoction of Lignum Guajaci, and
its Bark, Sassafras, Sarsaparilla, China, either singly or jointly used; adding
also, if you so please as a complement, the leaves of Primroses, Sage,
Rosemary, Cinnamon, Nutmegs. Of which Decoction the sick is to drink in the
Morning six or seven ounces in bed, and so to sweat thereupon an hour or more.
The second Decoction of the Ingredients being made more weak, ought to be used
at Table and Meals, as ordinary Drink, and to be continued for some weeks
together.

43. What other things sweat whether simple or compound we have given a large
Catalogue of in our Doron Medicum, Lib. 1. Cap. 10. Sect. 14. and 15. and Cap.
23. Sect. 52. ad 165. where you may receive ample satisfaction: to which you
may add the Decoctum Sudorificum Empirici Germain mentioned in our
Pharmacopoeia, Lib. 4. Cap. 14. Sect. 20. as also the next following it, and
many other good things which you will find at length in that Book. Sennertus
prescribes this following: Take Lignum Guajaci, eight ounces: Bark of the same,
roots of Elecampane, of Peony, of Orrice, the outer Rind of Citron-Peels dried,
of each one ounce: pure Water, five quarts: infuse them four and twenty hours
in a warm place, afterward boil and make a Decoction; strain and sweeten with
Sugar, of which let the sick take Morning and Evening six ounces, sweating
after it in the Morning.

44. Liquor Antiparalyticus Sennerti: Take Raspings of Guajacum, four ounces:
Bark of the same, one ounce; Sarsaparilla, one ounce and half: Raspings of
Sassafras, seven drams: Aloes, Galangal, of each a dram and half: roots of
Scorzonera, of Polypody, of Hermodactils, of Peony, of Fennel, of each two
drams and half: Peony seeds, two ounces: Spring Water, and Rhenish Wine, of
each a sufficient quantity: infuse four and twenty hours in a warm place,
afterward distill in a Vesica almost to dryness, or two thirds of the Liquor:
Into the distilled Liquor put Leaves of Betony, Ground Pine, Sage, of each one
handful: Flowers of the Tile-Tree, Primroses, of Arabian Staechas, of Rosemary,
of Lavender, of each half an handful: Flowers of Roman Cammomil, the three
Cordial-Flowers, of each two pugils: Venice-Treacle, two drams and half:
Mithridate, three drams: Citron-Peels, and seeds, of each two drams and half:
Cinnamon, six drams: distill all according to Art in Balneo Maris, and draw off
two pints and a half, which keep for use, adding thereto Manus Christi
confected with Oil of Cinnamon, and Oil of Amber, of each one ounce: Confectio
Diacymini with Oil of Cumin-seed, six drams: mix them: Of this Liquor the sick
may take four ounces Morning and Evening.

45. Much is attributed to a Water or Decoction of Rosemary (the Queen of
Hungaria's Water is good in this Case) being daily taken to three ounces with
six or ten grains of the Extract of the roots of Pyrethrum, or of Castoreum,
there is highly commended also a Decoction of the greater Burdock, root, also
Mithridate, Venice-Treacle, and Aurea Alexandrina, which may be given after it,
in bed to half a dram, two scruples or more.

46. Moreover besides the Decoctions of Guajacum, Sarsaparilla, etc. you may
exhibit for this purpose Spirit and Oils of Guajacum, the Powers of Guajacum,
Mixtura simplex, Flowers and Spirits of Sal Armoniack, Aurum Diaphoreticum,
Salt, Spirit, and Powers of Vipers, as also the Powder and Wine of the same,
Bezoar mineral vulgar and solar, Tinctures of Antimony and Coral, Powers of
Sassafras, etc.

47. To these things we may add our Guttae Pestilentiales, a thing of admirable
use in all paralytick Distempers, the which (because we will not too long
deprive the World of the knowledge of so excellent a Remedy) we will here
declare: Take tartarised Spirit of Wine, (drawn off from new Rhenish Wine and
pure Salt of Tartar) eight pounds: Carpobalsamum, eight ounces:
Virginian-snake-root, Radix contra yerva, Cortex Winteranus, Bay Berries,
Cinnamon, of each four ounces: Gentian, Cubebs, Zedoary, of each three ounces:
Cloves, berries of Kerms, of each two ounces: Nutmegs, Mace, Opium, of each one
ounce: Ginger, Pepper, Saffron, Cochenele, of each half an ounce; mix them:
digest twenty days, shaking the Glass twice or thrice every day; then let it
stand till it is fine and clear, and of a glorious red Color; decant the pure
Tincture from the Faeces; and keep it in a Glass close stopped for use: Dose one
spoonful at a time in a Glass of Sack, to sweat upon. It Is an admirable thing.

48. But besides the inward means, Sweating is to be promoted by external
Expedients, for that they excite the native heat of the Body, whereby the
humors and serosities of the Blood being rarefied and made thin, and the Pores
of the Skin more effectually opened, the morbifick Particles the more easily
and more readily exhale. For this Purpose there are Stoves and Hot-houses of
various kinds; as also Sweating-chairs, which are made hot with the Spirits of
Wine set on fire, or some other like sulphurous and combustable substance.

49. There is also a dry Bath, wherein the sick sweats only with the Vapor of
some Decoction, of which kind is this following of Platerus; Take roots of
Dwarf-Elder, three ounces: Acorus, one ounce: Hogs-Fennel of Dioscorides, two
ounces: Leaves of Sage, Ground Pine, Primroses, of each two handfuls: Origanum,
Pennyroyal, wild Time, Calamint, Hysop, Marjoram, Rosemary, Garden-Time, Bays,
Flowers of Cammomil, Elder, Juniperberries, of each an handful: boil them in a
Mixture of Water, Lie, and Wine: over the Vapor or Fumes of which let the
Patient (being fasting) sit naked, and repeat it often as he is able to endure
it.

50. But in great and almost desperate Palsies or Resolutions, the sick may
often sweat in Hartmans Chair, with convenient Intervals between each time: the
Chair may be warmed either by the Beak of an Alembick (distilling Spirit of
Wine, etc.) with many Holes in it, entering the Chair nere the bottom of it, or
with the Alchool of Spirit of Wine, or the Powers of Sage, Rosemary, Lavender,
Marjoram, Time, Origanum, Sassafras, Limons, Oranges, Caraways, or other things
of like nature. In this Chair the Patient is so long to sit as he can well
endure it, then he is to be removed to his bed, where he is gently to sweat for
two or three hours, and to be cooled by degrees. In the time of his Sweating
give some Cordial to strengthen and corroborate the Spirits, as also to
facilitate the Operation, as Aqua mirabilis or caelestis mixed with Juice of
Alkermes, etc.

51. But of all the outward Expedients for Sweating, the natural Baths of the
Bath, are thought to exceed, and by many esteemed as the best Remedy, from the
manifold Experiences of those who have been cured of the Palsy thereby: But
this Caution is to be taken in the use thereof; that because many times the
Bath does no good but injury to some Paralyticks, and in some it stirs up
convulsive Motions, nephritick Pains, Gouts, (and in others where there was not
a disposition thereto) Spitting of Blood. Asthma's, Consumptions, etc. and
because it may be difficultly discerned by the Physician before hand, whether
the Bath will prove beneficial or hurtful to the sick or no; the Baths ought
not to be tried without serious consideration of the nature and habit of the
Body, whether it be fit for their Constitution: Or if the sick will be so bold
as to try them first, they ought, if they be found not agreeeble to their
constitution, to be speedily left.

52. If you cannot with convenience attend the natural Baths, you may make an
artificial one after the following manner, by adding to the Water for
exsiccation-sake, Nitre, Vitriol, Salt, Alum, Tarta^, Sulphur, and often
extinguishing therein Gades of red hot Iron with such proper Vegetables, as
heating and drying, may be proper against the Disease: Take Flowers of Sulphur,
three pounds: Niter, one pound: Roch-Alum, Tartar, of each four ounces: white
Vitriol, two ounces: Juniper Berries, four handfuls: Leaves of Betony, Sage,
Marjoram, Penny Royal, Rosemary, Lavender, Hysop, Origanum, Time, Ground Pine,
of each three handfuls and half: Flowers of Cammomil, Melilot, Bay Berries, of
each two handfuls: roots of Pyrethrum, and Bryony, of each two ounces: boil all
in a sufficient quantity of Water for a Bath.

53. Diuretics are next to be considered, forasmuch as by them some Palsies
have been wholly taken away. Now since the Blood and Humors are very much
repleat with Salt, and are wont to be diversely changed by it, from one state to
another; it will be the Prudence of the Physician, to enquire what Salt that
is, which predominates, that such saline Diuretics may be given, whose
Particles are opposite, that thereby Health may be the more easily recovered
again. Therefore the Physician is to be well assured of the constitution and
habit of the sick; least he runs himself into error, and so instead of
restoring of Health, rather confirms the Disease.

54. However in this Case, considering we have a cold and moist habit of Body
to deal with, the sanguinous Salt is for the most part either sharp or acid;
and therefore Salts of a volatile, sulphurous and spirituous Quality are to be
chosen, such as is prescribed in our Doron Medicum, Lib. 1. Cap. 23. Sect. 173.
ad 188. and Sect. 221. ad 235. and sometimes Salts fixed and acids; but in these
latter Cases, the Physician ought to be very well persuaded and assertain'd,
before he makes use of them.

55. Vomitories sometimes also do yield a notable Relief in an inveterate Palsy;
because they draw away the Nourishment of the conjunct Cause; and do not always
promote, but oftentimes recall the morbifick Matter impacted in the Nerves, and
as it were weaken and break its Force by abstraction; so that by the continual
wasting thereof, the animal Spirit the more easily dissipates the remaining
Particles of the diseasy Miasms. But Vomits ought to be given to such as easily
vomit, or where part of the Cause is lodged nere the Stomach and Lungs. For
weaker Persons you may give Salt of Vitriol with Oxymel of Squills: or to the
more strong Emetick Tartar of Mynsicht, or Infusion of Crocus Metaliorum, or
Vitrum Antimonii; or or the Crocus in substance, or Sulphur of Antimony, which
have a Power to call even from the extreme Parts: these things being given a
while, you may with a Feather put down the Throat, provoke Vomiting four or
five times, drinking warm Posset Drink or Mutton-Broth between whiles.

56. Sennertus prescribes this Vomit: Take Radishes scraped or thin sliced, one
ounce and half: seeds of Redishes, and of Arrach, roots of Asarabacca, of each
two drams: Agarick one dram: Broom-Flowers, a pugil: boil them in Hydromel:
strain, and to four, five or six ounces thereof, add Oxymel simple, half an
ounce: and in stronger constitutions you may (says he) add depurated Juice of
Tobacco, half an ounce: He also advises to the use of the Flowers of Antimony.
Other Vomitories you may see in our Doron Medicum, Lib. 1. cap. 3. sect. 70.
and 71. and cap. 21. sect. 1. ad ultimam. But Vomits are to be used with
extreme Caution, as we before advised.

57. Salivation is the last extreme consideration, by the use of which several
Paralyticks have been recovered, which I my self, as well as some other
Physicians have observed: but it ought to be used only to an habitual and
inveterate Paralysis, and there where all other means have proved ineffectual;
but not in that which follows upon a Lethargy, Carus, Apoplexy, Cholick, or
Convulsions, or have too lax and weak a Brain: because as it is for the most
part attempted in vain, so oftentimes not without great hurt, by reason that
Mercury is apt to excite in such Persons frequent Convulsions.

58. Now how Mercuriates (whose proper office is Salivation) become beneficial
in a Paralysis remains to be declared. For by entering into the sanguinary Mass,
and separating of its Impurities or Faeculencies, it cut off that Matter by
which the Disease is nourished; the mercurial Particles passing through the
Brain, or otherwise, entering the nervous Passages, causes presently a
Fermentation of the morbifick Matter impacted in the neurotick System, and so
through their own power causing an Excretion, they so either disperse or expel
it, that the ways and Passages of the animal Spirit, in a short time become
clear.

59. We are now arrived to the vital Indication, wherein we shall show by what
means the Brain and Genus Nervosum, or the Organs generating animal Spirits,
and the Instruments of Sense and Motion, may be restored and corroborated, and
then conserved in their pristin estate. And this is done by such things as are
proper Cephalicks and Neuroticks, which have a peculiar and specific Virtue to
absume the Humidities of those Parts, and comfort them, by augmenting their
native heat: this done, we shall come to the last Intention, which is Topical,
and so conclude this Section.

60. Decocta Cephalica: Take Betony, Sage, Flowers of Arabian Staechas, of each
half an handful: Peony-roots, Fennel-seeds, of each three drams: Nutmegs, half
a dram: running Water, a quart: boil to the consumption of a third part, strain
and sweeten with Sugar. Or thus: Take roots of Peony, Cloves, of each two
drams: Marjoram, Betony, Sage, of each an handful: Flowers of Arabian Staechas,
two pugils: Flowers of Rosemary, of Lavender, of each one pugil: seeds of

and exceeding Subtilty and Power of Penetration, they do what no other kinds of
Remedies can.

94. We are now at length arrived to the Topic part of this Cure, by which we
also endeavor to recall the Heat and Spirits to the grieved Parts; and these
are either particular or general. The particular Topics are such as are
applied to the affected places, as Frictions, Cuppings, Issues, Setons,
Fomentations, Oils, Balsams, Ointments, Cataplasms, Cere-Cloths, Emplasters,
and Powers. The general are Sudorificks (as Hot-Houses, Stoves, Baths, of which
we have already spoken) and Mercuriates externally applied by way of Unction,
etc. and as we have taught in our Synopsis Medicinae, Lib. 3. Cap. 32. Sect. 6.
9. ad 17. to which we shall at this time refer you.

95. Where there is age and Strength of body able to bear it, you may use daily
Frictions on the Parts affected with course warm Cloths; but it ought to be
done gently, least the Heat and Spirits be not only attracted but also
dissipated: Moreover Frictions ought (if with convenience they can) to be used
before Fomentations, Anointings, Bathings, etc. for that thereby the Pores are
before hand opened, and prepared for the reception of the Virtues of the
applied Medicament.

96. Sometimes also Sinapisms and Rubifiers, are profitably applied; but these
are chiefly used when the resolved Part or Parts have lost the Sense of
Feeling: But when the Part is made red they ought to be removed, least the
Spirits by too great an Attraction should be dissipated, and such things ought
to be applied as may be warming only, confortative and strengthening, that the
attracted Heat and Spirits may be profitably retained in the said Parts.

97. After due Purging, Authors, chiefly Avicenna, very much commends
Cupping-Glasses to be applied, which is done for the most part without
Scarification to the Part or Parts affected, but with much Flame, yet they are
not to be continued long, least they not only draw the Heat and Spirits, but
also dissipate them, as we before observed in Frictions and Sinapisms: and that
that which is drawn away may be conserved, Sennertus advises an Emplaster
immediately to be applied made of Pitch and Pine-Rosin.

98. Vesications are with more caution to be used, except in Persons very
gross, and full of watery humors, in whom, the Nerves, and their capillary
Ramifications, are as it were soaked and overwhelmed with Water, for by this
means a great part of the morbifick Matter seems to be drawn forth easily and
speedily: And you may repeat the Operation several times upon the same Part and
Place, the Skin being first healed again: But you are to be very careful to
conserve the natural heat, by the application of fit Medicaments, of a warming
and corroborating Virtue, least hereby, it being too much dissipated, a
Gangreen should immediately ensue.

99. Issues are profitably applied in Cacochymick Bodies, or abounding with ill
humors, for they continually drain forth the morbifick Matter; and that so
moderately and by Degrees, that there is no danger of dissipating either of
Heat or Spirits; for thereby, Nature disposes of the offending Matter, and
sends it forth for her own Relief after an admirable manner: and these (for
their safety) may be used to old or young, Male or Female, without any respect
to the Sex or Age.

100. The Seton, which is also a kind of Issue may be used for the same reason:
it is commonly applied between the first and second Vertebra: but sometimes in
other places (pro ratione Membri affecti) that the humor oppressing the Nerves
may be evacuated: and, in the Opinion of some Men, the Seton is more profitable
than the other kinds of Issues, for that it evacuates more liberally and more
speedily (yet not in too extreme manner) but as they have one good convenience,
so they have an ill, which almost counter balances it, to wit, their
troublesomness; for that they are more tedious and painful than other kinds of
Issues are.

101. Suffumigations are also commended by some, where the Part or Parts
affected are (for a convenient time) held in the Fume or Fumes of some proper
and fit Antiparalytick, as of Amber, Olibanum, Frankincense, Myrrh, Benjamin,
Opopanax, Galbanum, Ammoniacum, Mastich, Sandrach, Gout-Ivy, Juniper-wood, etc.
Or you may make a suffumigating Powder thus according to Sennertus. Take Amber,
Mastick, Myrrh, of each one dram: Frankincense, two scruples: Cloves, Mace,
Nutmegs, Cinnamon, of each half a dram: Wood of Aloes, half a scruple: let them
all be made into a fine Powder, and moistened or sprinkled with Spirit of Wine,
and dried again, which repeat five times; make a Powder: which cast upon live
Coals, so that the Fume may ascend, with which fume linen Cloths, and
therewith gently rub the paralytick Members.

102. Anointings are next to be considered: the ancient Physicians used Oils of
Cammomil, of Lillies, of Orrice, of Hypericon, Elder, Rue, Bays, Costus, Spike,
Pepper, Earthworms, Foxes, of Castoreum, of Euphorbium, of Vipers, of a Stork,
of a Goose, and of a Cat. Some later Physicians have used the distilled Oils of
Juniper, of Wax, and of Vipers, also of Rosemary, Lavender. Others commend
Mans-Fat, as also the Fat of a Goose, Fox, Cat, (chiefly of a wild Cat) of a
Bear, of a Lion, and of Vipers, especially being mixed with hot and drying Oils,
such as the distilled Oils before named. Ex his varia pro re nata misceri
possunt.

103. Ointments. Unguentum Anserinum: Take an old fat Goose, deplume and draw
it, and fill the Body of it with the following things: Beeswax, Butter, Salt,
of each two ounces: Fox Grease, three ounces: wild Cats Grease, two ounces and
half: Hogs Grease, two ounces: Mans-Grease, one ounce: Marrow of the Leg of an

roasted with a gentle Fire, taking great care that it be not burnt, the Liquor
droping from it keep for use, to anoint the paralytick Members withal.

104. Or thus: Take a fat Goose, deplumate and eviscerate it, then stuff its
Body with Sage, Rosemary, Cloves, Indian Spicknard, of each a sufficient
quantity: adding also Fat of a wild Cat, one ounce and half: Pouders of Myrrh,
and Frankincense, of each half and ounce: Castoreum and Euphorbium, of each a
dram and half: Earthworms suffocated in Vinegar, number thirty: roast it after
the usual manner upon a Spit, basting of it with Vinegar of Rue, and the Fat

with which anoint the Parts affected, being first bathed and rubbed with Spirit
of Wine.

107. Take Ammoniacum, Bdellium, (dissolved in Spirit of Wine) of each half an
ounce: Fat of a Badger, of a Goose, of a Fox, of each three ounces:
Orrice-root, one dram: leaves of Rue, Betony, Cowslips, of each a dram and
half: flowers of Arabian Staechas, of Rosemary, of Cammomil, of Melilot, of
each one pugil: Storax Calamitae, Benjamin, of each two drams: Cloves,
Frankincense, Nutmegs, of each a dram: Oils of Foxes, of Castoreum, of
Earthworms, of Wax, of each a sufficient quantity: mix and make a soft
Ointment.

108. Take roots of Orrice, of Calamus Aromaticus, of each one dram and half:
Galangal, one dram: leaves of of Sage, of Rosemary, and of Ivy, Flowers of
Lavender, and of Arabian Staechas, of each one pugil: Oils of Foxes, of
Castoreum, and of Earthworms, of each two dram: Turpentine, one ounce: the
best White Wind, four ounces: boil to the consumption of of the Wine: strain,
and add Spirit of Wine, one ounce: Sagapenum, Bdellium, Castoreum, Styrax
Calamitae, Benjamin, of each a scruple: Nutmegs, Cloves, long Pepper,
Pyrethrum, of each half a scruple: Badgers-Grease, half an ounce: Wax, a
sufficient quantity: mix and make a soft Ointment.

109, Take Oils of Cammomil, and of white Lillies, of each one dram: of
Earthworms, and of Foxes, of each half an ounce: Species Diamoschu dulcis,
Powder of Ground Pine, and of Rosemary, of each half a dram: Castor, one
scruple: Fox-Grease, Wax, of each enough: mix and make an Ointment. Or thus:
Take Oils of Foxes, of Bays, of Turpentine, and of Castoreum, of each half an
ounce: Ointments Aregon, and Martiatum the greater, of each two drams:
Galbanum, Ammoniacum, Bdellium, of each one dram: Wax, enough to make a soft
Ointment.

110. Linimentum ad Paralysin Valeriolae: Take Earthworms washed in Spirit of
Wine, and dried in an Oven, half a pound: Ginger, Galangal, both in Powder, of
each half an ounce: Oils of white Lillies, and of Costus, of each a sufficient
quantity: mix and make a soft Ointment. For this Purpose the Vnguentum ad
Paralysin Valeriolae, and the Vnguentum Paralyticum Riverii, described in our
Doron Medicum. Lib. 3. Cap. 4: Sect. 32. and 33. may be profitable: as also the
Oynmtents. Agrippa, Aregon, de Bdellio, and both the Mariatums, which see in
their proper Places.

111. This Mixture has been of good use: Take an Ox-Gall, Spirit of Wine
rectified, half a pint: Oils of Rosemary, and of Aniseeds, of each half an
ounce: mix them well together, by shaking them in a Glass for about half an
hour; and keep it in a Glass close stopped for use: and therewith anoint the
paralytick Parts Morning and Evening, it is indeed an admirable thing.

112. If the Disease gives not place to these things, Sennertus advises to
Emplasters and Cerots to be applied along the Backbone, according to this
Form: Take Castoreum, Euphorbium, long and black Pepper, of each one dram:
Ammoniacum, Opopanax, of each six drams: Marrow of a Deers and of an Oxes-Leg,
of each two drams: Turpentine, six drams: liquid Styrax, two drams: Hens and
Goose-Grease, Hogs-Lard, of each a dram and half: Oils of Nard, of Orrice, of
Bricks, and of Turpentine, of each half an ounce: old White Wind, a sufficient
quantity to dissolve the Gums: boil all by a gentle Fire to the consistency of
a Cerot or soft Emplaster.

113. Or thus: Take Emplastrum de baccis Lauri, of Betony, and of Melilot, of
each one ounce: Frankincense, half an ounce: Castoreum, Euphorbium, of each a
dram: seeds of Gith, of Cresses, Mustard seed, roots of Pyrethrum, Niter, of
each half an ounce: with Oil of Bricks, or Amber, make all into an Emplaster:
which apply being spread upon Leather. Some make an Emplaster only of Gum
Tacamahacca, which they apply after anointing with Oil of Mans-Blood, or Balsam
of Galbanum. Doron Medicum, Lib. 1. Cap. 2, Sect. 12.

114. But before every new anointing Authors advise to cleanse the Part or
Parts from the Filth of the former anointing, by bathing and fomenting: Take
flowers of Cammomil, of Melilot, of Betony, of Marjoram, of Rue, of Sage,
leaves of Bays, of Ground Pine, of Hyssop, roots of Calamus Aromaticus, of
Orrice, of Pyrethrum, of Dwarf-Elder, and of Sow-bread, of each a sufficient
quantity: make a Decoction in Spring Water, with which very warm make a larder
of Venice or Castile-Soap, and bath the affected Parts therewith, or foment
them therewith, as you shall see convenient.

115. Or thus: Take Betony, Rue, of each an handful and half: Marjoram, Herb
Mastich, Lavender, Germander, Gout-Ivy, of each one handful: Calamint,
Origanum, Time, Horehound, Nettles, Bays, of each half an handful: Indian
Spicknard, Arabian Stachas, of each two pugils: Galangal, long Pepper, of each
one dram and half: Mastich, Amber, of each one dram: cut, bruise grossly, and
make a a Decoction for a Fomentation.

116. Or you may bath with this: Take Spirit of Wine, Spirit of
Juniper Berries, of each four ounces: chemical Oil of Castoreum, one ounce:
Powder of Mustard Seed, two or three drams: mix them.

117. Before the laying-on of any Emplaster or Cerot, it will be good to anoint
the paralytick Part or Parts with natural or artificial Balsam, or with some
distilled Balsam, many of which you may find in our Pharmacopoeia and Doron, of
most admirable use: to which add some others which we shall hereafter publish
in our Ars Chymica, not long hence to be delivered from the Press: in the mean
season take this of Matthiolus: Take leaves of Sage, of Marjoram, of Mint, of
Cowslips, of each one pugil: Spicknard, Saffron, Carpobalsamum, Olibanum,
Frankincense, Opopanax, Bdellium, Mastich, liquid Storax, Benjamin, Ammoniacum,
Mummiae, of each two drams and half: Turpentine, six ounces: all being poudred,
mix them with the Turpentine, put them into an Alembick and distill; first comes
forth a Water, then an Oil, afterward a Balsam good against the Palsy, and all
cold affects of the Nerves. in the Oil you may mix Musk in fine Powder one dram.

118. Of great force also are the distilled Oils of Sage, of Rosemary, of Time,
of Rue, of Bay-beries, of Juniper Berries, of Wormwood, of Southernwood, of
Savin, of Fetherfue, of Savory, of Tansy, of Marjoram, of Hyssop, of Mint, of
Origanum, of Calamint, of Lavender, of Spicknard, of Castoreum, of Sassafras,
of Rhodium, of Amber, of Caraways, of Aniseeds, of Oranges, of Limons, and of
Vipers; anointing with them Morning and Night: But the Powers and Elixirs of
the same things vastly transcend the Oils, being almost infinitely more
volatile, subtle, and penetrating, and so by consequence more able to loosen
and dissolve the obstructing Matter: and of these, the Powers of Rosemary,
Lavender, Sage, Marjoram, Anise, Sassafras, Amber, Castor, and Vipers excel all
others by many degrees, and perform what no other Medicaments can do besides.

119. But where the Powers cannot be had, and the Oils may; and because that in
some Persons the Oils simply used may prove too hot, you may make a Mixture of
them after this manner Take pure Oil of Ben, or of sweet Almonds, or
golden-coloured and sweet-scented Palm-Oyl, eight ounces: Oils of Rosemary, of
Nutmegs, of Sassafras, and of Aniseeds, of each two ounces: mix them well in a
Glass by shaking, and anoint therewith the Vertebrae of Back and Parts affected
Morning and Night.

120. If that proves not hot enough in some cold Constitutions, you may alter
the Proportion thus: Take Oil of Ben, or Palm-Oyl, eight ounces; chemical Oils
of Rosemary, of Savin, of Marjoram, of Juniper Berries, of Sassafras of Limons,
of Amber, and of Aniseeds, of each an ounce and half or two ounces: mix them by
shaking, as aforesaid, and anoint therewith: But if this or the former be too
hot, you may diminish the heat, by diminishing of the hot Oils thus: Take Oil
of Ben, or Palm-Oyl, eight ounces: chemical Oils of Rosemary, of Sassafras, of
Aniseeds, and of Amber, of each one ounce: mix them by shaking, as aforesaid,
and anoint therewith, as before directed. These things we advise where the
Powers cannot be had: but where they may be had, we absolutely advise to the
use of them, not only for the reasons before given, but for that they are
infinitely more excellent, efficacious and safe.

CVI. The Cure of the Palsy in a hot, dry and choleric Constitution.

1. If the Palsy be excited in a hot and choleric Temper, or in a young
Person, you must give Medicines of a milder nature, and less hot than what we
have before prescribed in a cold Palsy; for those more hot and Elastick things
do rather aggravate and increase the Disease than diminish it: and therefore
for a Diet you must wholly (forbear Guajacum, and) make use of Sarsaparilla,
and such like temperate things after this man^er.

2. A Diet for a Paralysis in a choleric C^nst^tution: Take mealy
Sarsaparilla, three pounds; bruise it in a Mortar: sal Prunellae, four or five
ounces: Peony roots and seeds, Burdock roots, Liquorice, Sage, of each half a
pound: Raisons of the sun, blew Figgs slit, of each two pounds: Water, five
gallons: infuse all twenty four hours in a gentle heat, then boil to the
consumption of one ha^f: strain, dulcify it to the Pallat of the sick with
white Sugar, and bottle it up with a Clove or two in each bottle for ordinary
drink.

3. Or thus: Take Sarsaparilla, two pounds bruised: Virginian Snake-root,
contra yerva, Zedoary, Peony roots, Burdock-roots, Liquorice, of each six
ounces: Carraways, Coriander-seeds, of each four ounces: Raisons of the sun,
blew Figs, of each a pound: sal Prunellae, three or four ounces: spring Water,
sixteen quarts: first boil the Sarsa to the consumption of a third part or
better: then put in the rest of the things, and boil till about eight quarts
only remain: then strain, dulcifie with white Sugar, and bottle it up, as
before.

4. Let the sick once a Week or oftener, purge with Diacassia with Rubarb, or
with Diaprunum Lenitivum, Electuarium amarum Magistrale majus and minus,
Diacassia with Manna, and without the leaves of Sena, Diacarthamum,
Diaphoenicon, Electuarium de Citro solutinum, Diaprunum solutivum, Electuarium
Lenitivum, and Passulatum, Catholicon, Tryphera solutiva, given in Rhenish Wine
and Peony-water, or in Clarified Whey, Elixir Proprietatis, made with the Oil
of Sulphur; the Infusion of Sena and Rubarb in half White Wine half Rose Water,
or with other things of like Nature; but the Physician may join with the Purge
proper Specificks against a Paralysis; as the salt of Wormwood, Extract of
Peony, Tincture or syrup of Steel, Volatile Salt of Millepedes, etc. as he
shall see fit.

5. The habit being in part altered, and the morbifick Matter mostly carried
off: it will be necessary to give such things as may strengthen and corroborate
the Organs and parts weakened; such as these following: Take roots of Aron, of
Male-Peony, Angelica, Imperatoria, of each half a pound: flowers of Sage,
Rosmary, Marjoram, Brooklime, Watercresses, of each four handfuls: Rinds of
six Oranges and four Limon: flowers of Prim-roses, Cowslips, Marigolds, of each
three handfuls; cut and bruise all, and put to them new Milk, six pints:
Mallago Wine, one quart: distill them in common Organs (with great care, that
there be no Empyreuma) and let the whole Liquor be mixed together.

6. An Electuary: Take Conserves of the flowers of Betony, of Fumitory, of
Prim-roses or Cowslips, of each two ounces: Species Diambra, one dram: Pouders
of Ivory, Crab's-eyes and Claws, of each four scruples: Powder of Peony-flowers,
two drams: Lignum Aloes, yellow Sanders, of each one dram: Salt of Wormwood, a
dram and half: with syrup of Peony-flowers, a sufficient quantity, make an
Electuary. Dose two drams twice a day, drinking after it, either the simple
Water of Aron-flowers, or some of the before prescribed distilled Water three
ounces; or as much of the Decoction of Sage, or of the above prescribed Diets.

7. Sometimes, instead of the aforesaid Water and Electuary, you may give
Mynsicht's Tincture of Mars, the preparation of which you may see in Our
Pharmacopoeia Londinensis, lib. 4. cap. 7. sect. 34. It is a most admirable
thing, and opens Obstructions in the remote parts as well as in the Viscera,
almost to a miracle: You may give it from six to twenty or thirty drops, in any
convenient Vehicle; chiefly a glass of Rhenish wine.

8. Or the Sick may take Dr. Willis his Syrup of Steel, which may be taken a
spoonful at a time in the former distilled Water, for fourteen or fifteen days
between whiles. It may be thus made: Take of the whitest Sugar dissolved in
black Cherry-water, and boiled up to a consistency, eight ounces: adding to it
of our steel in powder, three drams: let them be stirred together over the
fire; then by degrees pour to it Rosmary-water twelve ounces, warm; let it boil
gently for a quarter of an hour souming it, and pouring it forth warm through a
hair Sieve or strainer.

9. You may also exhibit Lozenges of Steel, made after this manner, viz. with
Sugar boiled sufficiently with Steel, adding the Chemical Oil of Amber, or of
Rosemary, half a dram; then presently pour it forth, for Lozenges. Dose two
drams twice in a day, drinking after it, a draught of one of the former Diets,
or six ounces of the following Apozem.

10. Take China root, one ounce: Raspings of Ivory, of Hartshorn, of each half
an ounce: white and yellow Sanders, Wood of the Mastich-tree, of each half an
ounce; infuse them in warm water and close stopped for a whole Night, six pints:
in the Morning add to them roots of Chervil, of sweet smelling Avens, of Broom,
of Parsley, of each one ounce and half: of the dried leaves of Ground Ivy,
Sage, Germander, Betony, of each one handful: Coriander seeds, three drams: let
them be boiled till half be consumed: then add to it White Wine, half a pint;
and strain it into a Jugg, upon the leaves of Watercresses bruised, two
handfuls: let it infuse warm, and close shut, for two hours: strain it again,
and keep it in a Vessel well stopped.

11. But if Choler boils in the Body, and the Constitution be exceeding hot,
you will find the following a most admirable Antiparalytick, and sometimes
performs Cures of this kind to a Miracle being long, and constantly given: Take
of the best rectified spirit of Wine, a quart: drop into it by degrees, of the
best Oil of Sulphur per Campanum, twelve ounces: shake it all well together:
stop it up close, luting if you so please the mouth of the glass; digest in a
warm place, or in the sun for the space of three months: at the end of that
time put all the Liquor into a glass Alembick, or a glass Retort, and distill
with a gentle and gradual Fire, increasing the fire a little toward the end,
but be very cautious that you make it not too great, lest you force over the
Magma. (For then your labor of distillation will be lost,) but having drawn
off the subtle and pure spirit, leave a thick Honey-like matter at bottom. Dose
of this Spirit a quarter of a spoonful or something more at a time in any
convenient Vehicle: The Magma remaining at bottom you may keep to mix with your
ordinary drink; and with this subtle Spirit the Paralytick parts may be
sometimes bathed.

12. After the same manner you may make a volatile Spirit with the Oils of
Vitriol, and of Salt, which being given in like manner will have the same
operation: those who have not the convenience of distilling of it, may use it
without distillation; they will (being so taken) find it a thing of admirable
use: but being drawn off according to Art, as before directed, it is much more
subtle and penetrating, and conduces to a much speedier cure.

13. As for Topics, things very hot are not to be used, but a bath of fair
water, or water wherein Sal prunellae has been dissolved, has been found in
these cases very profitable: you may make it after this manner: Take
springwater, a gallon: sal prunellae, three ounces: pure white Wine Vinegar,
half a pint: mix them for a Bath. and according to this proportion you may
augment the sal Prunellae and the Vinegar, if you have occasion for a bath for
the whole Body.

14. But if you would have the Bath withal to cleanse the skin, then you must
leave out the Vinegar, and dissolve in every gallon of water half an ounce of
the best Venice or Castile Soap; and a bath so made will both cleanse the
superficies of the Cutis, open its Pores, draw forth the dark and fuliginous
Vapors and Fumes, open the obstructions of the capilary Nerves, and so
facillitate the cure to admiration.

CVII. The cure of a Paralysis arising by consent from other parts or Diseases.

1. If the Disease is excited in a Scorbutic habit of Body, cold and moist,
you must take the self same method and course of cure, which we have Instituted
in the hundred and fifth Section of this chapter, and therefore we shall not
any more repeat those things in vain: but this is to be observed, that through
the whole course of the cure, as there directed, you ought always to mix with
the Antiparalyticks, Antiscorbuticks, for thereby the Scorbutic juice will be
depressed as well as the Paralysis removed.

2. A Diet drink may be instituted like those formerly prescribed, in which
also you may put the Juyces and Expressions of Antiscorbutick herbs, Or
Mustard Seed, or Rocket-seed bruised, or Horse-radish-roots scraped, etc. Or
into new Ale you may put the Juyces of Scurvy Grass, of Brooklime, of
Watercresses, of Garden Cresses, of Tarragon, and so let them work up
together; Or Mustard Seed or Rocket seed bruised, with Horseradish roots
scraped, and put up into a bag: after four days the si^k may take thereof.

3. All the Purges ought to be made in a liquid from, and of a spirituous
substance, that they may the more intimately mix with the Mass of Blood, in
order to purify and alter it; and withal to be mixed with some Antiscorbutick
Spirit, such as are the Spirits of Scurvy Grass, of Watercresses, of
Brooklime, of Horseradish, of common Radish, of Rocket, of Mustard Seed, of
Tarragon, of Garden-Cresses, of Aron, of Onions, of Leeks, of Garlic, etc.

4. The internal Specific Alteratives and Corroboratives ought also to be
joined with the said Antiscorbutick, Dr. Willis prescribes this: Take of the
leaves of Brooklime, Watercresses, and Plantane fresh gathered, of each four
handfuls: bruise them together, and pour to them of the distilled Water (at 66.
sect. 105.) eight ounces: squeeze the juice strongly forth, keep it in a glass,
and take three or four ounces of it twice or thrice a day.

5. Or this Medicinal Wine: Take Germander, Ground Pine, Scurvy Grass,
Brooklime, of each a handful: Sage, Rosemary, Rosemary-flowers, Marjoram,
Angelica, Tarragon, of each a handful and half: roots of Angelica, of
Master-wort, of Florentine Orrice, Horseradish, Black Hellebor, Mustard Seed,
of each half an ounce: Carthamus-seeds, Agarick, Hermodacts, Onions, Leeks, of
each three drams: Cardamoms, Cubebs, salt of Tartar, salt of Hartshorn, of each
two drams: The Ingredients being cut and grossly bruised, let them be put into a
bag, with three or four quarts of White or Rhenish Wine, which infuse for five
or six days: then let the Sick drink thereof about three or four ounces, three
times a day, always droping into it about eight or ten drops of Spirit of Sal
Armoniack.

6. A distilled Water: Take Garden Sourvy-grass, Watercresses, Brooklime, of
the greater Rocket, Rosemary, Lavender, Sage, Savory, Time, of each six
handfuls: flowers of Lavender and Stoechas, tops of sweet Marjoram, and Penny
royal, of each four handfuls: the yellow of fifteen Oranges, and ten L^mons:
Winter 's Cinnamon, Mustard Seed, Indian spicknard, Virginia-Snake root,
Contrayerva, of each four ounces: Galangal, Acorus, Florentine Orrice, large
Onions, of each three ounces: Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinnamon, Jamaica Pepper,
Cubebs, Horseradish roots, of each two ounces: all being cut and bruised
affuse thereon so much Rhenish Wine, as may cover all the Ingredients about two
handfuls over: distill in a Copper Vesica tin'd within, and let all the Liquor
be mixed together, which dulcify, with syrup of Peony-water.

7. Or, if you design to have a very strong Spirit to be taken in some few
drops, or in a small quantity in some other convenient Vehicle: you may draw
off the eighth part of the Liquor first distilling, and save it by it self:
then draw off the remainder by its self, which you may dulcifie to be taken
ordinarily, or reserve it for a new distillation. Or, if you so please, instead
of the Rhenish Wine, you may take so much proof Spirit of Wine, which digest
with the ingredients about twelve or twenty four hours, and then distill it off;
saving the first half of what distills for your use; and the other half for
another distillation, as before.

8. Among the number of the things which we commend in a Paralysis (whether
Idopathetick or Symptomatick; whether in a scorbutic habit of Body, or arising
from any other Disease) the Volatile salt of Beans is found by Experience to
transcend all other vulgar Remedies, and is thought by several learned and
experienced Men, not to be much inferior to the salt of Vipers, in paralytick
Distempers. The way of making of which, and its use, we have taught in Our
Doron Medicum, lib. 1. cap. 25. sect. 66. 67. 68 and 69. It prevails against
not only Palsies, but also Cramps, Convulsions, withred Limbs, Epilepsies,
Apoplexies, Gouts, Rhumatisms, Cholicks, and other Diseases of the Head, Brain,
Womb, Nerves, Tendons, and Joints; and is withal a most approved thing against
the Scurvy. You may give it inwardly from four grains to twelve or more in any
convenient Vehicle, or Antiparalytick Water, and that Morning and Evening, as
the Patient is in Age and Strength to bear it.

9. Outwardly, you may anoint the Paralytick parts with Oil of Anniseeds, or
Oil of Ben, with which the Volatile salt of Beans is mixed: or, it may be
dissolved in any Antiparalytick water, and the palsied Parts bathed therewith
Morning and Evening; for it penetrates notably, and opens the Passages of the
Spirits in the Nerves powerfully, comforting the parts, and restoring the
native heat.

10. Next to the Volatile Salt of Beans, we commend the Spirit, Powers, and
Volatile salt of Milepedes; the making of which we have taught in Our Doron,
lib. 1. cap. 25. sect. 133. these purify the whole mass of Blood, and expel its
impurities by transpiration: they powerfully mortify Acids, and therefore cure
old stubborn Ulcers, Fistula's, and Running Sores, Cancers, Jaundice, Scurvy,
Palsy, Numbness, and other weaknesses of the Nerves and Joints; they ease pains
of the Gout, Rhumatisms, and other dolors of the Nerves and Tendons.

11. They which cannot get these Preparations of Millepedes, may use Dr. Willis
his Pills, which may be prepared after this manner: Take Millepedes prepared,
three drams and a half: Pearls, one dram and half: root of Cretick Dittany, one
dram: Venice Turpentine, a sufficient quantity to make it up into a Mass, which
make into small Pills. Dose half a dram, drinking after it some Antiparalytick
water.

12. Or thus: Take powder of Millepedes, Powder of Bees dried, of each a dram
and half: Volatile salts of Armoniack and Amber, of each half a dram: salt of
Vipers, (or instead thereof, of Urine,) Oil of Nutmegs, of each half a scruple:
Balsam Capivi, a sufficient quantity: mix and make Pills for eight or ten
doses, to be taken Morning and Evening: it is a good Medicine, and of great
force.

13. Take Venice Turpentine, Balsam of Peru, of each one scruple: Viper powder,
Bezoar Mineral, Volatile Salt of Millepedes and of Amber, of each half a
scruple; mix them together.

14. Take Millepedes prepared, half an ounce: Bees prepared, Ponder of Vipers,
of each three drams: Nutmegs, two drams: Tincture of Salt of Tartar, Aetherial
spirit of Turpentine, of each seven ounces: distill in Balneo with a gentle
fire, so have you a Spirit and Oil, as also a deliquium of salt of Tartar. The
Spirit may be given in any convenient Vehicle, from a dram to two drams: the
Oil from seven to fourteen or twenty; and the Deliquium of Salt of Tartar, from
ten drops to thirty. You may also mix the Oil with Oil of Aniseeds, and anoint
therewith the parts affected. This last preparation is a thing of singular
force and use, and prevails mightily against a scorbutic Paralysis.

15. If a Paralysis comes upon a Fever, Lethargy, Carus, Apoplexy, Epilepsy,
Convulsion, or other cephalic or convulsive Disease, and be vehemently and
suddenly excited, you must labor to take away, the conjunct Cause, which for
the most part has its Seat in the oblong or spinal Marrow, and therefore at the
beginning of the Disease, Clysters, Purging, the Seton, Issues, Vesications,
Cupping-Glasses, Sternutatories, Errhines, Masticatories, Oils, Balsams,
Ointments, Powers, and other Exhibitions used in cephalic Diseases, which may
any way loosen, dissipate, or otherwise remove, the malign and morbifick Matter
fixed to the spinal Marrow, or Ramifications of Nerves coming from it, are to
be made use of. If these things do not, in about a Months space, so that the
Disease becomes chronick and habitual, other Courses (though long) are to be
taken, as are both curatory, confortative, and preservative, of which we have
largly spoken before.

16. If the Palsy proceeds upon or from a Cholick, the Cure consists in
correcting the Intemperature of the Intestines, and evacuating of the vicious
humors; then that the morbifick Matter, which is in the exterior Members, be
discussed, and the Parts affected corroborated. If the Bowels (in this case) be
obstructed, you must give Clysters of an humecting and absterging Quality.
These may be made of Mallows, Pellitory, Herb Mercury, Bears-breech,
Violet-leaves, and Goats Milk, to which you may add Cassia extracted, Oils of
Violets, and of Roses, with Goose-Grease, and Yolks of Eggs. For abstersion you
may profitably add a little Hiera simple, or Honey of Violets, or of Roses, or
a little Niter, or Sal Prunellae. These Clysters, if being exhibited once or
twice, it be not enough, you must repeat them three or four times or oftener,
till the irregular course of Nature is inverted, and the depraved humors of the
Bowels carried off.

17. After the Belly is opened and molified by Clysters, gentle Purgation is to
be administered, with which temperate Aperients are to be mixed. For this
Purpose you may give Syrups of Roses solutive, and of Violets solutive, Manna,
Rhubarb, and Rhubarb with Sena, with Powers of Aniseeds: If the Disease
requires stronger things, you may exhibit the Extracts of Esulae, of black
Hellebor, and of Turbith, or the Extractum Benedictum which you may see in our
Pharmocopoeia. But if the Ventricle be lax and humid, the use of Hiera will be
convenient, for that it will then better absterg the humors in the Bowels: now
if you fear that the heat and dryness thereof should hurt, you may exhibit
also with it something that humects and refrigerates.

18. The morbifick Matter being thus taken away, you may give such Remedies
every Morning fasting, as are commonly given to such as are troubled with the
Scurvy and hypochondriack Affection. As, Take spirit of Tartar corrected, Aqua
Salviae, or Mixtura simplex, of each a scruple: Aqua Paralytica, an ounce and
half: mix them. Or you may provoke Sweat with this: Take Cowslip and
Betony-Water, of each an ounce and half: Amber and Mother of Pearl both
prepared, of each ten grains: Extract of Galangal, eight grains: spirit of
Tartar rectified, half a scruple: Manus Christi confected with Oil of Amber,
three drams: Treacle-Water, two drams: mix them for a Dose.

19. Or with this following Bolus: Take Conserves of Betony and Sage, of each a
dram and half: Treacle, two scruples: Extracts of Gentian, Lignum Sanctum, and
Contrayerva, of each half a scruple: Salt of Commomil, eight grains: with Sugar
a sufficinet quantity make a Bolus. Which being taken, let a little Glass of
some antiparalytick Water be taken after it. Or thus: Take Conserves of Sage
and Rosemary flowers, of each a dram and half: Extracts of Gentian, of Calamus
Aromaticus, and of Cloves, Salt of Carduus, of each ten grains: mix them for a
sweating Dose.

20. Moreover some comfortative antiparalytick Medicament is to be instituted,
to be taken Morning, Noon, and Night, which may alter the habit, resist the
Disease, fortify the Stomach, and corroborate the Parts weakened, such as this
following: Take Extracts of Galangal, of Gentian, of Virginian-snake-root, and
of Contrayerva, of each half an ounce: Viper-Pouder, Extract of Lignum Aloes,
and of Calamus Aromaticus, of each three drams: chemical Oils of Rosemary, of
Sage, of Pennyroyal, of Lavender, and of Cinnamon, of each two scruples: Julep
of Kermes or syrup of Male-Peony flowers, enough to make an Electuary of a good
consistency: Dose from a dram to a dram and half at a time. We might say more,
and deliver other things in order to the curing of a Paralysis, proceeding not
only from these but other Causes: but he that has read over our foregoing
twenty Observations, cannot be ignorant what Method we hold most fit to be
followed in all Cases.

CVIII. The Cure of a Palsy, arising from Causes evident and accidental, as
from a Fall, Blow, Wound, Contusion, etc.

1. If Blood be extravasated there will be a necessity of letting-blood, for
the extravasated Blood can never return into its ancient Current again; for
thereby the Afflux to the Part is presently diminished and abated: this done, a
fit Clyster is to be administered that the Bowels may be made slippery and
mollified, and be the more ready to cast forth their Excrements.

2. Then if it proceeds upon a Fall, whereby it may be feared that some of the
inward Parts are bruised, the Pulvis ad Casum may be given in a fit Dose; or
Lucatella's Balsam: Some prescribe Irish slate, to the quantity of about a
dram, being given in a draught of White Wind or Tent, and repeated every six or
eight hours: drinking withal the Decoctum Traumaticum frequently, or as
ordinary Drink; or a Decoction of Madder-roots, or Butter-bur-roots, in half
Wine half Water.

3. Or you may give Venice-Turpentine made up into Pills with Powder of Zedoary
and Sugar, without boiling: of which you may give the quantity of a dram or
dram and half, Morning and Evening drinking after the same the aforesaid
Decoctum Traumaticum or Tent, or a Glass of mul'd Sack: Or you may give this
Electuary. Take Viper-Pouder, half an ounce: Extracts of Gentian, and of
Zedoary, of each two drams: with Juice of Alkermes a sufficient quantity make
an Electuary: Dose a dram at a time Morning and Evening; sometimes also gently
sweating upon it, being kept in the bed, that the Superfluities and noxious
Matter may copiously exhale from the affected and hurt Part, for thereby the
Spirits being gently agitated may repeat their former ways, and flow through
the late obstructed Pores, into their wonted haunts.

4. But if the Viper-Pouder be given for any time, it will be necessary gently
to purge the Body once a week, with some proper Purge: for the said Powder
creating Struglings, Contentions, Combinations, Fermentations, and Segregation
of Particles in the Blood, a morbid Matter will be made fit for Excretion,
which must be then carried off with a Purge. You may exhibit this: Take Sena,
one ounce: Rhubarb, Salt of Tartar, of each two drams: Spanish-Juyce of
Liquorice, one dram: Spring Water, a pint: White Wind, a quarter of a pint:
make an Infusion to redness, for four Doses.

5. As to Topics, Sennertus would have applied to the paralytick Parts not
simply adstringents, and refrigerents, as in a Contusion without a Palsy; but
partly discutients, and partly adstringents, with heating t^ings added, except
an Inflammation be present: for which purpose he prescribes this Emplaster: Take
Mastich, Frankincense, Gum of Ivy, of each half an ounce: Powder of
Earthworms, one dram: Marjoram, two drams: flowers of Cammomil, and of Roses,
of each half a dram: Oils of Roses, of Cammomil, and of Wall flowers, of each
one ounce: Turpentine and Wax, a sufficient quantity: mix and make a Cerot or
Emplaster.

6. If any thing be out of joint, be careful that it be reduced as soon as may
be into its place again: If a Tumor, Contusion, or Wound be, you are to provide
for them with proper Balsams, Liniments, Cerates, Emplasters, or with Stuphs,
Fomentations, Baths, Pultises. If nothing preternatural does appear outwardly,
lay over the hurt Part, either the aforesaid prescribed Emplaster of Sennertus,
or this: Take Oxycroceum, de Mimio, of each a like quantitity: mix and melt
them together, which spread upon new linen Cloth. The Balsam, Cerot, or
Emplaster being laid on, let the sick be kept very still and quiet, and in a
gentle heat for three or four days.

7. If the Palsy still remains, but the afflux of new Matter be not feared, let
more resolving and discussing Remedies be applied to the affected Parts, as
Fomentations with Spirit of Wine, hotter Balsams, or the Powers of Medicines,
which pierce warm and restore without inflaming: Or the palsied Parts may be
covered with Horse-Dung, warm Grains, or the Pressings of Gra^es when flung out
of the Wine Press (if it be in a Country where Vines grow:) Or they may be
thrust into the Belly of a Beast newly killed, or into a natural or artificial
Bath, and kept there for some considerable time.

8. In the Declination, you may diminish your Astringents, and increase your
Digestives, that there may be a dissipation of the Relics; and those
Medicaments may be made use of, which are proposed in a cold and moist Palsy:
Take Meal of Faenugreek, Powder of Althaea-roots, of each half an ounce: Powder
of Earthworms, three drams: Ammoniacum, Bdellium, Goose-Grease, of each two
drams: Oil of Roses, white Wax, enough to make a Cerat or Emplaster: which
apply upon the place affected immediately after it has been well bathed with
the Powers of Amber, Rosemary or Sage.

CHAP. IV. Of the APOPLEXY.
The AUTHORS Observations.
I. An Apoplexy in an elderly Woman.

1. A Woman near fifty years of Age, of a cold moist habit of Body; having been
for some time before vehemently afflicted with a Vertigo, was at length taken
with strong Convulsions, so that the Physicians then present, and others which
were about her, concluded her never able to overcome them: these Convulsions
and Convulsive Motions often returning, and handling her very sorely, made her
so weak and feeble, that a very great shaking and trembling took her almost in
every part: this trembling going off of her all at once, she seemed to be
perfectly well.

2. But she had not been in this condition above two days, when all on a sudden
she was taken with an Apoplexy: by which it appeared that the morbifick matter,
which before had seized the Nerves, Muscles, Joints, fleshy and extreme parts,
was now translated to the Brain: the consternation was great, for there was
loss both of the motive and sensitive Faculties; the Patient being in a deep
sleep as it were, but in all other respects as if she had been dead.

3. Being called to her whilst in the Fit, and perceiving she was not dead, we
caused a dram or two of this following mixture to be put into her Month: Take
subtle spirits of Nutmegs, of Cloves, and of Rosemary, of each an ounce:
Tincture of Castoreum made with the best rectified spirit of Wine, spirit of
sal Armoniack, of each two drams: subtle spirits of Amber, and of Hartshorn, of
each a dram: Aqua Antiparylitica, two ounces: syrup of Stoechas, an ounce and
half: mix them. A little of this was put into her Mouth, and part of it forced
down her Throat.

4. In the mean season Frictions were used to all her extreme parts: and her
Temples, Forehead, Nostrils, nape of the Neck, and Pulses were bathed with
this. Take Powers of Rosemary, of Sage, of Lavender, of sweet Marjoram, of each
half an ounce: Powers of Sassafras and of Pennyroyal, of each two drams: mix
them, to bath withal, as aforesaid. If these could not have been readily got,
we had anointed her with this mixture. Take Oils of Rosemary and Sage, of each
two drams: Oils of Ben, half an ounce: mix them.

5. While these things were doing, this following Clyster was prepared to be
exhibited: Take Decoction of Mallows, a pint: sweet Oil, two ounces: Powers of
Rosemary, of Carraways, of Aniseeds, and of Amber, of each a dram: Tinctures of
black Hellebor, and of Agarick, of each two drams: Tinctures of Colocynthis,
and Hiera picra, of each an ounce: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, half an
ounce: Salts of Rue, and of Carduus, of each half a dram: mix them. It was
injected warm, and in about half or three quarters of an hour, it wrought well,
so that there came from her by Stool, a great quantity of cold, slimy,
pituitous, as well as serous Matter or Excrements; when it began to work, she
came to her self again.

6. Afterward we caused her to continue the use of the first prescribed
mixture for three or four days: The next day, I purged her Brain with this
Errhine: Take White Wine, four ounces: Guttae Gambae, two scruples: Scamony,
ten grains: Euphorbium, six grains: dissolve the Gums in the Wine over a gentle
heat: this brought a great quantity of cold, viscous and serous Excrements out
of her Head; by which she confessed she found her self much more pleasant and
lightsom then in many weeks or months before: we repeated the use of them four
times at two days distance.

7. In the intermediate days we purged her with this: Take Extracts of
Castoreum, and of black Hellebor, of each fifteen grains: Resin of Colocynthis
and of Scammony, of each four grains: spirit of sal Armoniack, six drops: Oil
of Rosemary, two drops: Tartar Vitriolate, ten grains: Honey of
Rosmary-flowers, enough to make a Bolus. This purged her very well, gave her
eight Stools, and one Vomit.

8. But whereas she complained of a great heaviness and loathing at Stomach,
and oftentimes of a great Sickness there, and had withal a spontaneous
Vomiting: I exhibited a Vomit made of the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, which
gave her five Vomits, and emptied her Stomach of a vast quantity of viscous,
pituitous matter, which had for a long time afflicted her; and so took away her
Stomach, so that she could scarcely eat a Meals meat in a month with an
Appetite.

9. I ordered her the continuation of the first prescribed mixture, a spoonful
at a time Morning and Evening: and to drink three or four times a day of this
following Physical and Antipoplectical Wine. Take choice Rhenish Wine, choice
Canary, of each three quarts: Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Cinnamon, Cubebs, of each
half an ounce: Virginian Snake-root, Contra yerva, Bay Berries, Zedoary,
Rosemary, Lavender, Sage, Marjoram, Pennyroyal, Origanum, Aron roots, Agarick,
of each one ounce: Florentine Orrice root, Juniper Berries, of each two ounces:
Sena, four ounces: infuse, digest, and after four days take about two ounces of
the clear at a time, dropping into it every time, about eight or ten drops of
the spirit of sal Armoniack, or twenty drops of the best rectified spirit of
Hartshorn. By following this advise she became perfectly well, nor had she any
more fits.

10. After this very method, without any difference in the particulars, we
cured diverse others persons taken with an Apoplexy, so that they never had
above the third fit, and some of them not above the second, and they remained
absolutely free from their Distemper, for many years after.

II. An Apoplexy in a young Man of a sanguine Complexion.

1. Authors define an Apoplexy to be a stupidity with a resolution of the whole
Genus Nervosum, in which affect the Sick does not really Sleep; but being
astonished he lies stupid like a stock, all the senses alike, and motion
together with them being abolished.

2. But these Accidents are sometimes more mild, and sometimes more grievious,
in which both the internal and external Senses are taken away together, whence
the whole understanding is abolished; nor do they see, though some Apoplectical
Persons, seem to look upon a Man with fixed Eyes; nor do they hear a noise, nor
show any sign of sense, though you pinch, cut, prick, or burn them.

3. Also being deprived of all motion of the Body, and so becoming helpless in
a moment, they fall down, and all their Members being resolved do languish and
grow feeble: they neither speak nor swallow, but their Breath only remains,
which is oftentimes very obscure, and so little as scarcely to be discerned by
any artifice whatsoever, but is drawn with great difficulty and noise as in
dying people.

4. For this cause it was doubtless, that Frederick Deckers advised the Cure to
be considred on with a prognostic, whether there be life or not; being first
known either by a Candle lighted, the Windows being shut, (if life cannot be
known by the Pulse,) and moved to the Nostrils, or by a Feather or
Looking-Glass, held to the Mouth, to wit, whether or no the one be moved, or
the other stained; these things being tried, although no sign of life appear,
yet they are not to be buried before the third day, because, in that time, they
have been observed to come to life again.

5. In this difficulty of breathing, the Pulse is for the most part strong, but
discovers it self in great inequalities, and so it remains, till their senses
returning, they come to their selves again, but this is in the more gentle
Parox sms; for in the more Vehement they continue resolved; and where the
Disease is extreme, their breath being wholly taken away, they are immediately
suffocated; froth, slimy and Viscous matter for the most part, then flowing out
of their Mouth.

6. It is evident from what has been said, that the Brain must needs be
affected, for that all motion and sense proceeds from it: but it is not to be
thought that the functious are diversely weakened, as the fore, middle, or hinder
Ventricles of the Brain are hurt; nor as the Brain is affected before or
behind, for that the substance of the Brain does in all parts perform its duty;
and therefore as it is more or less hurt, so it loses more or less of its
function.

7. And if the hurt of the Brain be so great, as that all the senses be
abolished, whence motion also does cease; yet the other Functions (which the
Brain is not the cause of) may remain, as the Pulse which is excited by the
Heart. Now whereas the motion of breathing is partly Natural, partly voluntary,
it is manifest that it is caused from the Organs of both kinds of motion; both
of the Midriff and Lungs. And therefore it is, that though the Brain be very
much hurt, so as all voluntary motion does cease, the Midriff, or Muscles of
the Breast contributing then nothing to the motion, yet breathing may be from
the natural motion of the Lungs, they moving themselves after a sort, by a
natural or spontaneous contraction and dilatation, but it is with difficulty,
because it is performed but with one half of its Organs: And therefore if the
disaffection or hurt of the Brain does not speedily cease, (because the Lungs
cannot be able long to perform the whole duty of Breathing,) the Sick must
needs be suffocated; for that the Faculty in both kinds will be wholly
abolished.

8. But if voluntary motion is not wholly obliterated with the Senses, then the
respiration (in the Paroxysm) will be the more free: for as the disaffection of
the Brain is less, being compared with the former, by which the senses only are
oppressed, as in a sleepiness or gentle stupidity; so Motion (though thereby it
be made to faulter a little) will be less hurt, and may possibly persevere
against the prevalency of the morbifick matter.

9. Too great a coldness of the Brain may cause a Stupidity; and too much
moisture Immoderate Sleep; which being extravagantly heaped up within the Skull
(by reason of the faeculencies of the Blood and weakness of the part) and there
suppressed or stopped, so as that it flows not through the passages appointed for
it; but perfuses it self through the substance of the Brain, may cause a Carus:
where if it stays long, so as to moisten or make soft and lax, the bulk of the
Brain, and so flowing abroad, falls upon, or presses the original of the Nerves
proceeding from the Brain at the Basis of the Skull, it will stop up the
Avenues or Passages of the Animal Spirit, and so cause a strong Apoplexy. This
humor if it stop not here, but does descend from thence and follows the course
of the Nerves, causes the Apoplexy to end in a Palsy.

10. That these things are thus in a Carus and Apoplexy, has been evident after
the Death of the Patient; for that the said humor has sometimes flown from the
H^ad by the Mouth and Nostrils in a very large proportion or measure. Moreover
in some that have been disseased, it has been found that the thick Membrane
being cut open, a great plenty of humor has presently ran forth: And Authors
affirm, that the very substance of the Brain in a certain old Woman, who died
of an Apoplexy, was turned into a Cream-like substance, and presently ran all
over her Face. But in another ancient Woman, who died of an Apoplexy, which my
self saw opened, only a Bladder of Water about the bigness of a small Hens Egg
was taken out of the fore Ventricle of the Brain; this Woman was troubled with
a Vertigo for some time before, and died in her first fit. In this latter case
the morbifick matter did not possess the whole Brain, but tending to some
particular part, formed it self a Vesicle, to which it had an habitual recouse.

11. If Blood be carried out of the Vessels, and diffuses it self into the
substance of the Brain, so as to obstruct the Windings and Ventricles by
suddenly filling them, whereby the Original of the Nerves are oppressed and
stopped, it causes a Stupidity and Apoplexy: and this often happens a Vein being
broken, occasioned many times, from a fullness of the Vessels in such who
formerly having been accustomed to Haemorrhages at Nose, fluxes of the Terms,
or Haemorrhoides, have them suddenly stopped: In whom it has been observed, that
near Death, and presently after it, a large flux of Blood, has broken forth
from their Mouth and Nose: from whence we may conclude it, to be the chief
cause (in these persons) of an Apoplexy.

12. The like may be from an external violent Cause, as a Contusion of the
Brain from a fall or blow (though the substance of the Brain be no ways
wounded) by which the blood also may fill the Cavities of the Brain, and its
substance, especially in those places where it is contused; as is daily seen in
the Brains of a Bullock killed or knocked down with an Hatchet or Ax, whereby
the Brain is filled with clotted blood: And therefore in this case an Apoplexy
follows, unless a bleeding at Nose or Ears, or other adjoining passages, does
immediately ensue. Yet sometimes the blood stopped in the part is clodded and
retained till it putrifies, and then by causing a Frenzy, Convulsion, Lethargy,
or Apoplexy (according to the quality and disposition of the matter) kills the
Patient.

13. And this also comes to pass, when the substance of the Brain is hurt by
cutting or pricking, whereby its action is then destroyed: And when the Brain
is comprest by a depression of the Skull, especially if the Compression be very
great: As also when by some stronger force the bulk of the Brain is as it were
pressed together, or pressed upon the original of the Nerves; in all these Cases it
must needs be that an Apoplexy must follow.

14. If the Animal Spirits be so wasted or consumed, as to cause not only a
weakness of the Functions of the Brain, but also a total oblition of them, a
very strong Apoplexy, and sudden killing of the Patient follows, of which we
have seen several old men dye: yet this can hardly be without some Corruption
of the part, or putrified humors filling the Cavities of the Brain.

15. The History of this present Cure is very remarkable, for this young man
being of a sanguine habit of body, and so easily heat or inflamed, after a
severe drinking of Wine and other strong Liquors, to Drunkenness, became almost
insensible, and at length seemed like one dead, so that he could not be awaked
by the bystanders: Whereupon a Physician was sent for, which coming in and
viewing him, declared it to be an Apoplexy, as indeed it was.

16. His assistance being required, he used many things in vain; so that
another Physician was sent for, who immediately endeavored to let him blood,
but he would not bleed: At length some of his Relations desired, that I might
be sent for, which was done: when I came to him, I beheld the miserable object
with wonder, for he lay so stupefied, as if he had been perfectly dead, nor
could we by any means discern Life in him.

17. My advice was desired: The case I found to be desperate, and therefore
required both desperate and speedy help, for that no ordinary means (already
used to him,) could do him any good. Upon a little pause, I thought upon the
learned Deckers his Errhines, which is a bold and almost irresistible
Medicament; and although it can scarcely be given without danger, and seldom
without great Symptoms following it; yet because it makes large Evacuations
from the Head, and may be blown up the Nostrils, when nothing can be put or
forced down the Throat, and the Patient withal being (as it were) insensible,
I concluded it reasonable to exhibit the same, which with the consent of the
other Physician was done.

18. The composition of the said Errhine is this: Take Turbith Mineral, one
part: subtle powder of Liquorice, three parts: Rosemary-flowers, one part and
half; mix them exactly in a most subtle powder. F. Deckers Exercitation. Pract.
cap. 1. page 19. where he has these Words. Duorum Vltimorum horumce (speaking
of this here described, and another going before it) pulverum minima fere
quantitas sufficit, multumque pituitae viscidae educit; cum successu
praescribuntur hipulveres in Apoplexia, Epilepsia Lethargo, capitisque
affectibus soporosis omnibus, necnon in quibusdam capitis affectibus
recentibus, and inveteratis vertigine, gravedine, etc.

19. Upon this advice it was, that I adventured to exhibit the said Medicament,
and indeed it went not without the desired success; for after that a small
quantity of it had been blown up the Nostrils of the Sick, he soon began to
stir, and a large Evacuation of Pus, water, and viscous matter mixed with blood
was immediately made, upon which he a little revived; and being almost come to
himself, a very great flux of clear blood presently followed, nearly to the
quantity of a quart, so that in less than an hour and half after the Exhibition
of the Medicament, he became perfectly freed from the Paroxysm, his speech
understanding, and other Senses being all restored to him.

20. From hence it may almost be safely concluded, that the Disease might
proceed from the large quantity of blood filling the Ventricles of the Brain;
for after the young man had bled thus freely he was not only freed from the
fit, but also became much more lightsom and cheerful than he was before,
concluding that he never found himself better in all his Life: And his Head he
said was much lightsomer and pleasanter than he had found it formerly.

21. However I caused his Head, Forehead, nape of the Neck, Nostrils, and
Pulses to be anointed with this following mixture. Take chemical Oils of Rue,
of sweet Marjoram, of Mint, of Featherfew, of Pennyroyal, of each one dram:
Oils of Rosemary and Lavender, of each a dram and half: mix them to anoint
with. This was used at the time of his coming out of the fit, and I ordered him
to be anointed with it Morning and Night for ten or twelve days together.

22. Inwardly, this following Water was given him by spoonfuls for three, four
or five hours, and afterward I prescribed him the use of it Morning and
Evening for a month together: Take the Aqua Antapoplectica Poterij, six ounces:
the best Cinnamon Water, four ounces: Elixir Panis, three ounces: spirit of
Hartshorn, half an ounce: mix them, and keep them in a glass close stopped for
use. Dose one or two spoonfuls or more at a time, dropping into each dose at
the time of drink^ng, six drops of Spirit of Sal Armoniack.

23. The next day I purged him with this: Take Resin of Jallap, Scammony in
fine powder, of each six grains, fine Aloes, one scruple: Zedoary, sixteen
grains: Oil of Rosemary, three drops: with syrup of Buckthorn, make it into
five Pills for one dose. Being gilded he swallowed them, and they wrought with
him so strongly, as to give him almost twenty Stools, by which without doubt a
great part of the morbifick matter was also carried off: This Purge ten days
after was repeated again.

24. But that we might secure him against another fit; I thought good to order
him once a week to take the Sternutatory of Martin Rulandus, which he describes
in his Centuries, and is as follows: Take Darnel, Nigella-seeds, white
Hellebor, of each a scruple: sweet Marjoram, Rosemary, Sage, of each half a
dram: Musk, two grains: make all into a subtle powder for sneezing. Of which
the quantity of a Pease was blown up into his Nostrils in the Morning.

III. An Apoplexy in an old Woman, of which she dyed suddenly.

1. This Woman was much given to drink Brandy, so that she could scarcely live
without it, and many times would drink it so immeasurably, as to be extremely
drunk therewith, at last she was so overcome with it, as that she fell into a
fit (which indeed was a fit of the Apoplexy) wherein she lay for Dead, and so
it proved in the sequel, for she never came to her self again.

2. Being dead a great deal of matter (thick and thin) came out at her Nose, to
the quantity of a pint and better, mixed with some streaks of Blood, and it had
withal the smell of Brandy, together with a foetid scent, very unpleasing to
the standers by.

3. Her Head being opened, the whole substance of the Brain seemed to be
corrupted, and altered from its natural property, not much unlike the matter of
a rotten Egg: But upon the original of the Nerves was found a black clodded
matter, which seemed to press them, it is probable it was coagulated blood,
which by reason of the length of time being there, and the corruption of the
Brain adjacent to it might loose its natural color and form.

4. This Woman before this fit fell upon her, which ended her days ( to wit,
for about two or three months,) had been affected with a certain kind of
Trembling of her whole Body chiefly of the extreme parts, and was much troubled
with a Vertigo by fits, so that she could not stand, which those who daily
frequented her, thought came only from the present drinking of Brandy: which
though it might be the principal remote cause; yet without doubt the conjunct
cause was the matter which was daily bred in the Brain, and joined to the parts
hurt, part of which, when Nature could not longer bear it, but yielding her
self overcome, was expelled at the Woman's Death.

IV. An Apoplexy in a middle aged Man.

1. This Man being a lusty, strong, well-set Man, after eating a hearty Meals
Meat, and drinking two or three bottle of Wine, was all of a sudden taken with
an Apoplexy; upon which I was immediately sent for, and found the man lying
void of all Sense or Motion, breathing only excepted.

2. I caused Frictions to be used to him; and into his Mouth this following
Spirit was put. Take spirit of Rosemary and Lavender, of each an ounce: spirit
of Mint, half an ounce: Aqua Coelestis, two drams: spirit of Hartshorn, one
dram: spirit of Sal Armoniack, half a dram: with syrup of Peony-flowers
du^cifie it. This was put into his Mouth, and forced down his Throat.

3. Outwardly his Head, Nape, Forehead, Temples, and Nostrils, were anointed
with Oil of Rosemary, mixed with a half part of Oil of Rue: and his Breast and
Stomach were bathed with the following mixture. Take Powers of Rosemary, of
Lavender, of Nutmegs, of each half an ounce: Powers of Mint, and sweet
Marjoram, of each two drams: Powers of Sassafras and Savin, of each a dram: mix
them.

4. Whilst these things were a doing, this following Clyster was prepared for
him: Take Mutton-broth, half a pint: Honey, Oil Olive, Infusion of Crocus
Metallorum, Infusion of Colocynthis, of each two ounces: Tincture of Sena and
Scammony, of each an ounce: mix them to be exhibited warm. This in less than
half an hour began to work with him, and gave him five stools, by means of
which he came to himself again, but could not speak plain.

5. Now considering that this Disease came from repletion, at least upon a full
Stomach, I gave him forthwith this following: Take Infusion of Crocus
Metallorum, an ounce: syrup of Squils, six drams: Salt of Vitriol, fifteen
grains: mix them. This gave him four easy Vomits, and workt three times
downwards with him, by which he found himself much relieved, and that fullness
and oppression of Stomach, and sickness at Heart removed, so that in about two
hours, he was perfectly recovered out of the Paroxysm, which was so vehement
upon him, as that it seemed to threaten Life.

6. But fearing the fit should return again, I ordered him the constant taking
of the compound Spirit first above mentioned every Morning fasting: And at
Noon, half an hour before Eating, I prescribed him to take the quantity of a
Wall-nut of this following? Conserve of Rosemary-flowers, six ounces: Indian
preserved green Ginger, four ounces: Indian preserved Nutmegs, number three:
beat all very well together in a Mortar to a Pulp, which done add thereto Oil
of Cinnamon, half ad ounce: Juice of Alkerms, and Aqua mirabilis, of each a
sufficient quantity to make the Mass an Electuary of a middle consistency.

7. At Night going to bed I prescribed him a draught of this following Wine:
Take choice Canary; three quarts: Virginian snakeroot, Contrayerva, of each two
ounces, Zedoary, winters Cinnamon, of each one ounce: Cloves, Nutmegs, of each
two d^ams: Pepper, one dram: being all in Powder make an Infusion for six days
shaking it every day. Of the clear he took about four ounces at a time being
dulcified (at time of taking) with white Sugar, and dropping into the same also
eight or ten drop of the Spirit of Sal Armoniack.

8. The third day after the Fit, I caused the former Vomit to be repeated,
which wrought very well upon him, so that he seemed to be thoroughly cleansed:
by persuing this advise he had no more Fits, but became perfectly well. And by
this very Method, with very little variation, I cured a Gentlewoman of about
fifty years of age; and a Maiden Getlewoman of about six and twenty, save that
this latter, had the repetition of a second Fit, but no more, and so became
well.

V. A poor laboring Man taken with an Apoplexy in the Feilds in Harvest-Time.

1. This Man aged about seven and thirty, having led a loose course of Life,
and given himself up to drinking and idleness, became not only very poor but
also diseased: he was for two years before this Apoplexy seized him troubled
with a Vertigo, which vehemently afflicted him at certain times, and that
sometimes with an extreme Hemicrania or Megrim, so violent for two or three days
(when it came) that it often made him delirious, and some of his Neighbors
feared his going mad.

2. This Vertigo and Megrim continuing upon him, brought at length through
extremity of Pain Convulsions, which as yet only afflicted the Head: But
accidentally taking an exceeding Cold, he fell into a Diarrhoea, which was
accompanied with a vehement Griping of the Guts: This being not carefully
removed, but through Carelessness adding Cold to Cold, produced Convulsions of
the Mesentery, which sympathising with those in his Head, caused universal
Convulsions, throughout his whole Body, so that this wretched Creature was made
a Spectacle of Misery.

3. In this Condition those about him, caused him to be anointed with Oil of
Turpentine mixed with Linseed Oil, and then they gave him half an ounce of
Mithridate to sweat upon, which indeed gave him Relief as to his then present
Distempers, but cured him not perfectly of his Convulsions, but at times, or as
he took Cold they would return again upon him.

4. Being thus afflicted, and not reforming his irregular course of Life, by
reason of an universal Corruption of the Blood, unnatural Heats and colds,
imprudent drinking of cold Liquors, when he was extremely hot, and an
Indisposition, Weakness, and Hurt of the Parts, either generating, containing,
or conveying the animal Spirits, this miserable Creature of a sudden, unthought
of, fell (going from his Labor to Dinner) into a fit of the Apoplexy.

5. I being accidentally in the Country at that time, was desired to come to
him, and do something, to whom they gave the former Relation of his course of
Life. But being absent from the City, and not having the convenience of such
Remedies as I would have applied, could I have had them, I was forced to make
use of necessity, and take the most probable Things to do him good which might
there be had.

6. In the first place I caused a Sternutatory to be made of Tobacco, which
being finely poudred was blown up his Nostrils, by which in a little time he
sneezed, and much Water came out of his Head by his Nostrils: amd in about a
quarter of an hour I caused the Sternutatory to be repeated again.

7. Also I caused about an ounce and half of Brandy to be put into his Mouth,
and forced part of it down his Throat, which with the Sneesing caused him to
move a little and almost brought him to himself again: In the mean season a
Woman was dispatched into the Town to a Chandlers for a little Oly of
Turpentine, with which I caused his Nape, Forehead, Temples, Nostils, Breast,
Stomach, and Pulses to be anointed gently. By the use of these Things, in less
than an hour space he was restored out of the Paroxysm.

8. Being thus recovered he was carried to the Town, and put into a warm Bed
(for he was in a cold clammy Sweat:) and I caused him to drink a pint and half
of Cardus-Posset Drink; by means of which he vomitted plentifully, and after
the vomiting was over, he fell into a moderate Sweat, in which he continued for
four hours: When he called for Drink, which he did often; I permitted him to
have Ale, in which Cloves, Mace, and Nutmegs had been boiled, a little sweetened
with white Sugar.

9. The third day after, I purged him with my Family Pills, by which he had
about fourteen Stools, and I ordered him to take them once a week for about two
months together: By the use of these things he was reduced to his prestin
health, nor had he after any more fits.

VI. An Apoplexy in a middle-aged Man, which proved mortal.

1. This Gentleman about the age of two and forty, of a seeming strong and
robust Body, who both eat and drank well, yet as to the main, led a temperate
course of Life, was all of a sudden taken with an Apoplexy, so that to the
Standers-by he seemed to be dead.

2. Physicians and Chyrurgions were sent for, by whose advise he was presently
let blood, but they could draw little from him, then they applied Vesicatories
to the Nucha, and other Parts; sharp Clysters of Colocynthis and Aloes were
exhibited, besides apoplectick Waters and Spirits to the Forehead, Temples,
Nostrils, and Pulses, but all in vain, for what ever they could do, could by no
means restore him, but in this Fit he dyed.

3. Being dead as they apprehended, a great flux of Blood followed by the Mouth
and Nose, so that he bled nearly a quart of Blood, mixed with a little Water,
which being cold and coagulated, turned almost as black as Soot, and being
tasted (by a Chyrurgion which was there) was foun^ to be of a bitterish salt
Taste.

4. His Relations caused him to be opened: in the lower Abdomen, they found
nothing amiss, save that the lumbar chylous Receptacles were more than twice
their ordinary or common bigness, but very free from any kind of Obstruction
either in themselves or Parts adjacent.

5. The Thorax being opened the Gall Bladder and Liver were in their due and
natural Proportion and Condition; but the Spleen was grown to an excessive
Magnitude, being nerely three times the common bigness, but without any Tumor,
Scirrhous, Kernel, Hardness, or any other perceivable Distemper: the Heart and
Lungs seemed well, save the Heart was empty of Blood and the Septum transversum
in the Heart was found as it were slit.

6. The upper Ventricle being opened, the Brain seemed to be firm and entire,
but the Blood Vessels were very eminent and apparent, large, and as it were
overcharged and swelled; and all the Cavities of the Brain (notwithstanding the
great quantity which after Death came away) were filled with clotted Blood,
whilst the Heart (as before said was found empty. These things being thus
discovered and known, it is very doubtful to me, whether it might have been in
the Power of any Medicine to have retrieved this Gentleman out of his
Distemper; or, if all Things had been before hand known, whether it had been
possible to have prevented it.

7. One Reason which I offer for these doubts is the largeness of the chylous
Receptacles, which gave a demonstration of breeding more Blood than might
either serve the Intentions of Nature, or is common to supply the Uses and
Necessities of a Man of his Bulk and Magnitude: and by reason the Spleen was of
an extraordinary bigness, it showed that it provided a sufficient quantity of a
Ferment for the assimulation of the extraordinary Production of Chyle, and
alteration and changing it into Blood, with which the Vessels seemed at this
time to be overcharged.

VII. An Apoplexy in another Person, which proved mortal.

1. A Man about fifty years of age, in a Journey was seized with an Apoplexy,
in which he seemed to be deprived of all manner of Sense and Motion, in which
Condition he lay for about six hours, but at length by the Industry of some
about him, more especially of an ancient Gentlewoman, he was brought to some
kind of Sensibility, but not to the use of his Limbs, or his Tongue; for he
could stir neither Hand nor Foot, but as they were moved for him; nor could he
speak so as to be understood.

2. Physicians and Chyrurgions were sent for, who bleed him, raised
Vesicatories, applied Cups, used apoplectick Waters, Oils, Ointments, and
Balsams, and gave him several inward Medicaments, but all in vain, for by no
Artifice cold they retreive his Speeh: and though he had in some measure his
Senses and Understanding, yet it was but dull, and he very inclinable to Sleep.

3. The next day after a Purge was given him (a sharp Clyster having been given
over Night:) this Purge although it was strong and brisk, and might have given
him several Stools, (considering that his Body had been before hand opened with
a Clyster) yet wrought not at all, nor made him sick at Stomach, which showed
that the Faculties and Functions of the Body were in a manner obliterated or
abolished, so that there scarcely was found any tract or footsteps of Natures
vivacity.

4. The Physic not working, a second Clyster was given him, but that did as
little good, for that came no more away; from this time forth he grew worse and
worse, and more stupid and ^nsensible every hour than other, in so much that
the third day a new Fit seized him, in which he expired.

5. Being dead a kind of foe^id Matter (to the quantity of half a pint) came
out of his Nostrils and as it were mixed with a pretty quantity of putrified
Blood. His Head was opened, and the Cavities of the Brain were found abounding
with such like Matter; the substance of the Brain it self was much altered,
being extreme lax or loose, and in some places watery; in others as it were
corrupted: and (which was more remarkable) the Original of the Nerves was
pressed with a Bladder of Water, not very large; but so admirably was the
Vesicle located, that it was firmly tied by four cross Ligaments, viz. at each
end, and on either Side; the uppermost of which was hollow, and had a Passage
into the said little Bladder: and out of which, when the Bladder was cut off,
the Water issued.

VIII. An Apoplexy in a Man coming after the sudden stopping of a violent
Catarrh.

1. This Man (about seven and forty years of age) having been for more than
three years troubled with a vehement Catarrh, had it all of a sudden stopped
(without any previous evacuation either upwards or downwards) with the Fumes of
Amber (which he recieved into his Mouth by a Funnel,) and by the indiscreet
taking of Opiates.

2. At the first stopping of it, the Man feared he should have his Breath
stopped, so great an Obstruction he found in the Thorax, but the second day
following he was of a sudden taken with an Apoplexy, whereupon I was
immediately sent for; having heard the former Relation, I presently conceived
that the morbifick Matter was translated to the Brain, and therefore that there
ought to be a speedy evacuation of that Part, and that by str^ng and powerful
Remedies.

3. In order to this Purpose I first ordered a sharp Clyster to be prepared
after this manner: Take Milk or Mutton Broth, ten ounces: Infusion of
Colocynthis, an ounce: fine Aloes, two drams diss^lved in Rose Water: Infusion
of Crocus Metallorum, two ounces: sweet Oil, three spoonfuls: mix them to be
exhibited warm.

4 Whilst this was doing I caused liquid Errhines to be injected up his
Nostrils thus made: Take White Wind, half a pint: Euphorbium, ten grains:
Cambogia, half a dram: dissolve them in the Wine, this was gently syringed up
his Nostrils, but it did no good, nor in the least move his Head.

5. Wherefore seeing that, I was forced to make use of a stronger Medicine,
which was that formerly mentioned of Deckers, composed of Turpethum minerale,
etc. This in a short time caused his Head to purge vehemently; in about two
hours, above three quarters of a pint of filthy Matter came out of his Head by
the Mouth and Nose; and by the gentle use thereof two or three times, (once a
day) a kind of Flux was produced at the Nose, in which it was thought that more
than two quarts of Filth and watery humors were evacuated, by this evacuation
he was in a very little time restored out of the Paroxysm.

6. Being thus freed from the Fit, I caused his Temples, Forehead, Nostrils,
Nape of the Neck Stomach, and Pulses to be anointed with this following
apoplectick Balsam: Take Oil of Nutmegs by Expression, three ounces: chemical
Oils of Rosemary, of Rue, of Sage, of sweet Marjoram, of Oranges, of Limons, of
each a dram and half: Oil of Sassafras, and of Rhodium, choice Musk, of each
one dram: Ambergrise, half a dram: mix them perfectly, and make a Balsam to
anoint with Morning and Night.

7. Every Morning fasting I caused him to take three or four spoonfuls of this
following Water of Sennertus, called Aqua Carbunculi (in his Institutes, Lib.
5. Par. 1. Sect. 3. Cap. 5.) which is thus prepared: Take flowers of Rosemary,
of Lilly-Convally, of Violets, of Borrage, of each six ounces; red Mint, one
ounce: Marjoram, Lavender, Sage, of each three ounces; Nutmegs, Mace, Ginger,
Cloves, Cinnamon, Cardamus, Grains of Paradise, Cubebs, Galangal,
Juniper Berries, Misleto of the Oak, Hasle-Bark, Peony-seeds, Raspings of
Hartshorn, of each one ounce: Elks-hoof, half a dram: the Ingredients being
cut and bruised, affuse thereon Malago Wine, two quarts: waters of
Damask-Roses, of Straw-berries, and of Spicknard, of each three pints: let them
stand in Infusion for a Month in a cold place, then draw off the spiritous
water according to Art.

8. Half an hour before Dinner, he took a Wine-Glass full of this Liquor: Take
Nutmegs, Mace, Cubebs, Ginger, Zedoary, of each half an ounce: Cinnamon,
Galangal, Cloves, Calamus Aromaticus, Jamaica-Pepper, Florentine-Orrice,
Virginian-snake-root, Contrayerva, roots and seeds of Peony, Rocket-seed, of
each two drams: Rosemary and Lavender flowers, of each two handfuls and half:
infuse them all in a gallon of Rhenish-Wine for fourteen days, then distill off
the Water in a Copper-Vesica acccrding to Art.

9. Every Night going to bed, by reason he was of a scorbutic habit of Body, I
caused him to take two or three ounces of this following antiscorbutick Water
of Sennertus: Take Barks of Tamarisk, of Ash, of Caper-roots, Polypody of the
Oak, of each one ounce: Gentian, six drams: roots of Elecampane, of Aron, of
each half an ounce: roots of Crow-foot cut small, a pound and half: Germander,
Gout-Ivy, Carduus Benedictus, of each an handful: Troches of Wormwood, and of
Capers compound, of each one ounce: infuse them all for four days in Whey of
Goats-Milk, three pints: Rhenish-Wine, two quarts: afterward add Juyces of
Scurvy Grass, of Watercresses, of Brooklime, of Fumitory, of each eight
ounces: and distill a Water according to Art.

10. Once a week (for six weeks together) I purged him with my Family-Pills
with Aloes, for that they eradicate the Scurvy, and carry off the Matter of a
Catarrh almost to a Miracle: Moreover the liquid Errhine at 4 above mentioned,
I used to him three or four several times, one days distance being between; by
this means the morbifick matter was completely carried off, and the Patient
confessed himself to be more pleasant and lightsome, than he had been for some
years before.

11. But that we might so secure his Health, that these Fits might no more
return upon him, considering he was of a cold, moist, and pituituous habit of
body, and subject to a Rheumatism or Catarrh, I caused him for five weeks or
more to drink a Diet-Drink made of Guajacum, Sarsaparilla, Sassafras,
Juniper Berries, Anise, Coriander, and Caraway-seeds, with Raisons and Figs
according to the ususal manner, following my Counsel and using this means, he
was so well cured that he was perfectly freed from his Disease.

IX. An Apoplexy in a cold and moist scorbutic habit of Body.

1. A Woman about forty years of age, of a cold, moist, and scorbutic habit of
Body, was of a sudden seized with a Fit of the Apoplexy, in which both Sense
and Motion were abolished, and she lay like one that was dead, for no Life
could (for a Season) be perceived in her.

2. Being sent for whilst in the Paroxysm, I caused to be put into her Mouth
this Mixture: Take Spirit of Angelica, half an ounce: Tincture of Castoreum,
Syrup of Male Peony-flowers, of each two drams: mix them: This was put into her
Mouth, and part of it was forced down her Throat.

3. And that we might cause the Head to purge or evacuate (for she had before
hand complained of a heaviness and giddiness of her Head for some weeks before
this Accident happened to her) I caused to be blown up her Nostrils this
following Sternutatory: Take of the best Spanish Tobacco, one ounce: Cloves,
Ginger, white Hellebor, of each two drams: roots of Pyrethrum, of Cambogia, of
each one dram: Cubebs, Zedoary, of each half a dram: make all into a fine
Powder: This wrought well and brought from her Head much cold and viscous
Matter; by means of which in a little more than half an hour she began to stir
and move herself, yet knew no body.

4. Her Forehead, Temples, Nostrils, and Nape of the Neck were anointed with
this Oil: Take Oil of Ben, one ounce: chemical Oils of Rosemary, Sage,
Lavender, Savin, Sassafras, Marjoram, Pennyroyal, Juniper berries, of each one
dram: mix them. This comforted both the external and internal Senses, and
without doubt was in part a means of her more speedy Restoration.

5. But by reason her Body was bound for about two or three days (contrary to
her natural Custom and Use) I prescribed this Clyster to be administered: Take
Mutton-Broth, a pint: Honey, Oil Olive, of each three spoonfuls: Infusion of
Crocus Metallorum, three ounces: mix them and give it warm. This in about half
an hour came away, bringing with it some few hardened Excrements: I caused it in
half an hour after to be repeated again, and that brought away more of such
like hardened Excrements, with some softer: seeing this I prescribed a stronger
Clyster to be exhibited (about four hours after) which might have Power to
empty the Foeces and cleanse the Bowels.

6. It was thus made: Take Mutton-Broth, twelve ounces: Solution of two drams
of fine Aloes in Spring Water, two ounces: Tincture of Colocynthis, one ounce:
Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, three ounces: Oil of Roses, Honey, of each two
ounces: mix them to be exhibited warm: This wrought well.

7. By the using of these Things, in about six hours time she was perfectly
recovered out of her Fit: but complained vehemently of her Stomach, and that
the Oppression was as great as if a Load of Lead lay there: she desired that if
possibly it might be removed, for otherwise she should not be able to subsist
under the burden of it; and therefore earnestly craved a Vomit.

8. After a little consideration, I thought good to gratify her desire:
accordingly the next day, I prescribed this following Emetick: Take
Radish-water, four ounces: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, six drams: Oxymel of
Squils, an ounce: mix them. This was given in the Morning fasting, and it
wrought exceeding well, giving her five Vomits and three Stools, and the fourth
day after it was repeated again, with very good success: By these two Vomits
she confessed the heavy load at her Stomach was wholly removed.

9. But that which was thought to be one main cause of her Distemper, was the
Obstruction of her Courses, which had been stopped upon her for more than ten
months, for which reason I caused her to purge with this Tincture twice a Week:
Take Cardamon water, a quart: Sena, two ounces: fine Aloes, one ounce: infuse
the Sena forty eight hours, then press out, after which dissolve the Aloes in
the Colature, and let it stand till it is fine: Of this she took a spoonful or
two, more or less, (according as she found it to purge her) in the Morning
fasting, and continued the use thereof for a Month, viz, till such time as her
Courses came down, which when they appeared were in a very plentiful manner.

10. I chose to purge her with Aloes, for that they have a specific Property
to provoke the Terms in Women, and open the Mouths of all the Blood Vessels in
any Part of the Body, but more especially in the Womb: her Courses being now
produced, she found herself much better in her Head than formerly; and that
Vertigo, with which she had been for some weeks before troubled was now wholly
taken away and removed.

11. And because of the Scorbutic habit of Body, cold, and moist; I prescribed
her this Antiscorbutick Diet, which she took for fifty or sixty days together.
Take new Ale, three gallons: Juyces of Scurvy Grass, of Brooklime, and of
Watercresses, of each a pint: juice of Tarragon, half a pint: Sena, four
ounces: shavings of Guajacum, of Horseradish root, Juniper Berries,
Sarsaparilla, Carraway and Coriander-seeds, of each three ounces: Raisons of
the sun stoned, a pound: new Figs slit, half a pound; all these latter
Ingredients being grossly bruised, put them up into a bag with a stone in it,
which put with the juices into the Ale whilst it is working, after the working
is over, and the Liquor clear, it may be bottled up, putting into each bottle
half an ounce of white Sugar, and a Clove slit.

12. Of this she drank near a bottle a day, sometimes more, sometimes less,
which purged her very gently, and by the continuation thereof for the time
before mentioned, together with the use of the other things according to order,
she was not only freed from her Apoplexy; but also cured of her Scorbute, which
had for some years afflicted her, and made perfectly well.

X. An Apoplexy in an elderly Man of a robust Constitution.

1. This Man near fifty years of Age, of a very strong Body and Constitution,
had an Issue running upon his left Arm for near twenty years or more, which by
carelessness or some other cause, was dried up, without any due purging of his
Body, or other Evacuations necessary in such a case: about three months after,
he was taken with a very tedious and painful Megrim, which afflicted him for
twelve days or more; so violent that all about him feared he would go Mad: This
ceasing, a kind of Vertigo took him, which held him for about a day or
something better; at the end of which time hoping to grow well, he was all on a
sudden seized with an Apoplexy.

2. By the relation of the matter and previous Circumstances going before, it
is manifest that there was a translation of the morbifick matter (which had its
customary evacuation at the Issue) to the Brain; and that the Disease had been
a long time a gathering before hand, the Megrim and Vertigo preceding it, both
arising from the same causes.

3. These things being known, I thought it matter of absolute necessity to
evacuate as much as possible might be the Brain, and to cleanse it of those
foeculencies which contained the Animal Spirits, and obstructed their afflux:
For this purpose I immediately ordered the exhibition of Deckers his Errhine
made of Turpethum Minerale, etc. which powder was blown up his Nostrils with a
quill, in small Proportions, and repeated for three days after.

4. By the use of this Medicament, a great quantity of filthy matter was drawn
from his Head, almost to wonderment; and in about an hour, or hour and half at
most he so revived, as that he looked about him, moved himself, and began to
speak: in the mean season this following mixture was given him by spoonfuls.
Take Aqua Vitae Matthioli, two ounces: small Cinnamon Water, spirit of
Castoreum, of each one ounce: syrup of Citron-peels, three ounces: mix them.
This apparently revived him, and did him much good.

5. This Clyster also was exhibited warm: Take Mutton-broth, a pint: Infusion
of Crocus Metallorum, Honey, Oil Olive, of each three ounces: Tincture of
Colocynthis, an ounce: mix them. It wrought very well, gave him five Stools,
and brought away much viscous, slimy, and cold matter.

6. His Head, Forehead, Temples, Nostrils, and nape of the Neck was bathed with
this mixture; Take Powers of Rosemary, Lavender, Sage, and sweet Marjoram, of
each half an ounce: Powers of Origanum, Pennyroyal, Limons, Oranges, and
Juniper Berries, of each two drams: Powers of Amber and Carraways, of each one
dram: mix them together, to bath with as before directed: also four or five
times a day thirty or forty drops of the same, was given inwardly in a glass of
Wine.

7. The Man being revived, and thus come to himself again, I caused a Seton to
be applied to the nape of the Neck, and the Issue to be kept running for a
month: at the end of the time, I caused his former Issue to be opened again,
and the Cautery to be dried up, to the Intention, that the derivation of the
morbifick matter might be continued, to prevent his relapsing into the same
again.

8. And by reason he was of a robust Body; and very strong Constitution, I
thought good to purge him well several times: This was done with my Family
Pills which wrought with him admirable well. He took them twice a week, and
continued the like use of them for five or six weeks together.

9. And to corroborate the Animal and Vital parts hurt by this deliquium. I
caused him to drink for a quarter of a year or more (every Morning fasting, and
every Night going to bed, and sometimes an hour before Dinner) of this
following Antapoplectick Wine. Take ch^ice Canary, Rhenish Wine, of each two
gallons: Rosemary-flowers, Lavender-flowers, Wormwood, red Sage, sweet
Marjoram, musked Cranes-bill, of each a handful: Origanum, Pennyroyal, Mint,
Time, of each half a handful: Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinnamon, Cubebs, Anacardiums,
Zedoary, Virginian Snake-root, Contra yerva, Winter 's Cinnamon, of each half
an ounce: Ginger, two drams: Pepper, one dram: Musk, a scruple: cut, bruise,
and digest in a cool place for ten days, shaking the glass every day:
afterward being settled, the Sick may drink three, four, or five ounces of the
clear at a time, as before directed.

10. By these means derivation was made of the offending matter, and our
Patient in a short time restored to his perfect health, having no more fits
after the first. By this very method (setting the Seton aside) we restored
another middle aged Man seized with an Apoplexy, when the danger of Death was
not small. And by the same means (with very little difference) we cured a young
Woman taken with the same Disease, after she had suffered under three several
and dangerous Paroxysms.

Observations from other AUTHORS.
XI. The Apoplexy in a lazy Monk.

1. A certain Laick among the Regular Monks was taken with a very vehement and
grievous Apoplexy; he was phlegmatic, plethorick, (for he did too plentifully
ingurgitate thick Beer) lazy and somnilent; he fell suddenly to the Ground, and
could not be stirred up by any Noise, Shouting and Shaking, being seized with
such a Numbness and Stupefaction as those that are astonished.

2. When he was thus afflicted he was deprived of all Sense and Motion
throughout the whole Body, his Breath only remained to him, yet that was not
entire and without Intermission, but diverse ways dissentaneous and disagreeing.

3. When I came to him, I found him snorting and all his Parts and Members,
trembling, and that there might be no Delay used in resisting this Malady, I
made Retractions, Ligatures, and Compressions, and a sharp Suppository I
ordered him of the Powder of Colycynthis, Hiera, Salt and Honey, when the
following Clyster was preparing.

4. Take Centaury the lesser, Sage, Betony, Herb Mercury, Beet, Gout-Ivy, of
each one handful: the flowers of Cammomil, of Stoechas of both sorts, of each
one pugil: Aniseed, two drams and half: Female-Agarick, one dram and half: the
Pulp of Colocynthis together with Agarick tied in a thin linen Rag, one
scruple and half: let them be boiled in common Water, one pound: the Rag being
strongly pressed, then add to the Colature choice Hiera-Picra, Benedictum
laxativum, Diaphoenicum, of each half an ounce: the Oil of Rue, of Cammomil, of
Anise, of each one ounce: brown Sugar, the Honey of Roses strained, of each
half an ounce: Salt, three drams: make a Clyster.

5. Having by this got five stools, he was presently raid out of that Paroxysm,
but the Apoplexy ended in the Palsy.

6. Whilst he was strong, we put to the Clyster a scruple and half of
Colocynthis, although Rembertus Dodoneus says, That some would add Colocynthis
in Decoction for an apoplectick Clyster, one handful at the most, such a
Decoction will suffice for two or three Clysters, too much of the Colocynthis
is not without danger, for it gnaws the Intestines, and opens the Mouth of the
Veins.

7. I do remember says Rembertus, that by a Clyster wherein one dram of
Colocynthis was boiled, the Person though strong did not live long; and that
some few hours after expiration a great quantity of Blood did flow forth at the
Fundament; however being tied up in a Rag and pressed, it hurts less.

8. Yet Rondeletius is for giving one dram and half of the Pulp of Colocynthis;
but he advises it for expurgation of the Foeces, and that the Body might be
thereby warmed and the Passages dilated.

9. If the Disease proceeds only from Obstructions, a weaker Clyster after this
manner prepared, may be exhibited: Take Mallows, Marshmallows, Rue, Centaury
the less, Elder, of each one handful: Raisons, number forty: the seeds of
Anise, Fennel, and Caraway, of each three drams: the flowers of Stoechas,
Rosemary, and Elder, of each one pugil: Polypody of the Oak, the seeds of
Carthamus, of each one ounce: Agarick, two drams: the seeds of Nettles,
thirteen drams: make a Decoction for one pound, in which dissolve Honey of
Roses strained, one ounce and half or two ounces: Hiera Picra, and Benedictum
Laxativum, of each half an ounce: Hiera Colocynthidos, one dram: Oil of
Cammomil, three ounces: make a Clyster, and let it be given in the beginning;
it is the first in the Apoplexy, and in the Epilepsy the second.

10. After this manner the second should be in the Apoplexy: Take Mallows,
Marshmallows, Bay leaves, Centaury the less, Origanum, Calamint, Pennyroyal,
Cowslips, of each one handful: the seeds of Cubebs, wild Rue, and Nettles, of
each three drams: Polypody of the Oak, the seed of Carthamus, of each one ounce
and half: the tops of Time, the flowers of Rosemary, and Stoechas, of each one
pugil: Agarick, three drams: the Pulp of Colocynthis, one dram: make a
Decoction of one pound, in the Colature dissolve Indi Majoris, half an ounce:
or Diaphoenicon, one ounce: Benedictum, one ounce: Hiera Colocynthidos, half an
ounce: the Oil of Lillies, or of Anise, of Rue, of each three ounces: Salt Gem,
one dram and half: make a Clyster, which is the second in an Apoplexy, and the
last or third in an Epilepsy.

11. The last and third is strongest which is thus: Take Bay Leaves, Rue,
Centaury the less, Origanum, Calamint, Pennyroyal, Sage, Bawm, Betony, of each
one handful: the seeds of Nettles, of Cubebs, of Anise, of bastard Lovage, and
of wild Rue, of each three drams: Agarick, the root of Hellebor, of each two
drams: the Pulp of Colocynthis, one dram and half: the flowers of Sage, the
tops of Thym, the flowers of Stoechas, of each one pugil: Wheat-Bran, one
pugil: make a Decoction; in the Colature dissolve Benedictum and Hiera
Colocynthidos, or of Rufus, or Archigenis, of each one ounce and half: the Oil
of Rue, or of Nuts, or of Anise, of either three ounces: Salt-Gem, two drams:
make a Clyster.

12. This third Clyster which is strongest, must not be used if the Patient be
weak, but to those that are strong, strong Medicaments in so desperate a Malady
must be applied, proceeding from milder to stronger Things.

13. About the same time there came a Barber-Chyrurgion to visit the Patient,
whom he rubbed with Aqua Vitae to which he added a certain Powder, then
prescriped an Electuary of the Juice of Roses, by which things this impudent
Fellow, did boast he had cured this Person, but this did no good to the Patient.

14. Afterward I was again called, and would very willingly had let him blood,
but he being very much against it, and being now paralytick and abounding in
Phlegm, this following Decoction was given him.

15. Take Sage, Marjoram, Betony, of each one handful: Cowslips, Gout-Ivy, of
each half an handful: the Flowers of Stoechas, and Rosemary, of each one pugil:
the seeds of bastard Lovage, of Anise, and Hartwort, of each one dram and half:
let them be boiled in a double Vessel in one pound of common Water, adding to
the Colature, Honey of Roses strained, Syrup of Stoechas, of each one ounce and
half: mix them and make an Apozem for three Doses.

16. Afterward I purged him in the following manner: Take Pil. Cochiae, two
scruples: Pil. Foetidae trochisated, Alhandal, of each half a scruple: with
Syrup of Stoechas make seven Pills. Having taken those, he voided about six
times much flegmy and pituitous Matter.

17. When that was done we ordered the following Lininiment for the Nape of his
Neck, Backbone, and Side: Take the Oil of Cammomil, one ounce: Oil of Foxes,
half an ounce: the Oil of Castoreum, Oil of Bricks, of each two drams: with a
little Wax make an Ointment.

18. Moreover he was to take every Morning fasting the bigness of a Chest-nut
of the following Mixture: Take Conserve of the flowers of Rosemary, two ounces
and ha^f: Species Diamoscha, two drams: choice Tr^acle, three drams: Syrup of
Stoechas, one ounce: mix them.

19. Afterward he presently made use of the following: Take Conserve of the
flowers of Rosemary, three ounces: a Confection of choice Mithridate, half-an
ounce: Species Diambrae, one dram and half: Syrup of Stoechas, and Oxymel of
Squills, of each one ounce and half: mix them.

20. Within a few days he grew well by these Medicines and the Apozem once
repeated and last of all the Pills; but after a year and half through a bad
Diet, and immoderate drinking he again relapsed in the Apoplexy, by which he
was suffocated before I could get to him. Petrus Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 69.

XII. Of some taken with an Apoplexy and suddenly dyed, that were of an hot and
moist Constitution.

1. In our Regions that are cold and moist the Apoplexy is most frequent, it is
so in cold Places because of the Situation of the Earth, as in Florentia,
Lucas, and Bononia, or from the nature of the Region, as in Germany, and
Britanny, but more in Holland, and in the Cities of Amsterdam and Delf, and in
other Places where a great quantity of thick Beer is drunk, as also in Men that
are phlegmatic, idle and use moist and bad Diet; but chiefly among those that
are of a cold, moist and dull Constitution.

2. Among many that dyed suddenly of this lamentable Disease, there was one
ancient Gentleman, to whom by these two Physicians Scutius and Nievenius,
Frictions were exhibited in the sound and whole Part, as also a Lenitive to the
Mouth; afterward Cornelius Ericius and myself were invited.

3. This Person before he was taken with an Apoplexy, was for a long time
obnoxious to a Catarrh, and to a great Pain of the Head, but he unfortunately
thought the Distemper not to be so dangerous as to consult the Physician in due
time and to use proper Medicaments.

4. And so his Disease increasing, and he therewith more perplexed, at length
the Apoplexy was turned into a Palsy, and the Rheum which was retained so long
in his Breast, which he could not cast up, was the cause of his Suffocation, of
which he dyed in the eighth day of his Sickness. Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 70.

XIII. Of an Apoplexy suddenly ending in a Palsy, and suddenly cured.

1. A certain Person gross, dull and fat, being afflicted with a Plethory and
evil Habit of Body, and perpetually laboring under an Asthma, and being
obnoxious both to a Catarrh and Cough, This Man having arrived at the sixtieth
year of his age, and it being told him whilst he was walking, that a familiar
Friend of his about the age of eighty dyed suddenly.

2. Presently his left Foot began to tremble, and going home after he had sat a
while, he was taken with an Apoplexy, and, if his Son had not been, with him,
he had fallen.

3. Immediately after his left Foot turned paralytick, when I came to him, I
found him sitting deprived both of Sense and Motion; his Mouth was as it were
drawn together, he did not speak, yet a Distillation issued forth.

4. Having used Frictions, I put into his Mouth the following Confection: Take
Oxymel of Squills, one ounce: Mithridate, two-drams: But this came out of his
Mouth with the Phlegm.

5. I prescribed the following Clyster to betaken: Take the roots of
Marshmallows scraped, one ounce and half: Centaury, Rue, Betony, Sage,
Marjoram, Beet, Mercury, of each one handful: red Coleworts, half an handful:
the seeds of Anise, of Caraways, and of Fennel, of each one dram and half: make
a Decoction in common Water one pound, adding Benedictum Laxativum,
Diaphoenicon, of each six drams: Diacatholicon, three drams: the Oils of Rue,
of Cammomil, of Anise, of each one ounce: Salt Gem, one dram: common Salt, half
a dram: mix them and make a Clyster.

6. The Clyster being injected, his Belly was loosned and he began to speak,
then we dissoved the following Pills in Betony-Water, and his Mouth being
violently forced open, we put them in, and his Mandibles or Jaws being again
shut, he swallowed them being dissolved as aforesaid.

7. Take Pil. Cochiae, one dram: Troches of Alhandal, three grains: with
Betony-water make seven Pills: By these he had six stools.

8. When we came to him in the Morning, he could speak and move his Tongue,
though it did trip and stammer a little, as also his Leg, which was for
sometime paralytick, and he was at that Juncture as it were cured both of the
Apoplexy and Palsy.

9. But because his Memory was somewhat hurt, and his Mind as it were stupefied,
therefore we ordered him Oxymel together with Mithridate, as also the following
Recipe.

10. Take Oxymel of Squills, Syrup of Stoechas, of each one ounce: Conserve of
the flowers of Rosemary, of Sage, of each half an ounce: the Species Diamoschi
dulcis without Musk, one dram: Nutmegs consected, three drams: Syrup of
Stoechas, a sufficient quantity: make a Confection.

11. But this Person having been not only afflicted with an evil habit of Body,
but also with a Plethory, and having a very red Face, his Veins being very
large and visible, I ordered a Chyrurgion to be sent for, that the cephalic
Vein might be opened, in order to prevent the return of the Disease.

12. For it was usual with him to have Blood to flow out at his Nostrils, which
excretion had been intercepted for some years; and by our appointment every
year Blood was taken away, whereby he found himself much the better; but almost
for the space of a year it was now intermitted.

13. Another Physician coming to see him, did dissuade him from letting of
blood, because there was too much Pituosity and Phlegm in the Disease, for that,
says he, Bleeding does immediately cure the Apoplexy or kills.

14. Nevertheless seeing the Apoplexy is sanguinous, the opening of a Vein is
very convenient, and although it were a pituitous and phlegmatic kind of
Apoplexy, there being a Plethory in the whole Compositum, yet it does not
follow that letting of blood is unnecessary, but the rather I judge innecessary
to be done, especially when the S^^ength yet remains firm, which is further
approved of by the Practice of several learned Doctors.

15. There were Pills prescribed him by a Physician, in whom they did much
confide, but he loathing them, they were rejected. Therefore the following
laxative Draught was prescribed both by him and me.

16. Take Diaphaenicon, half an ounce: Confectio Hamech, two drams: the
lenitive Electuary, half an ounce: dissolve them in three ounces of
Borrage-water, (for he had by some Cause before contracted Melancholy) add the
Syrup of the Infusion of white Roses, half an ounce: mix them and make a
Draught: whereby he had some six or seven Stools.

17. Afterward he grew well, though it was much feared he might very easily
relapse again by reason of his Plethory, evil habit of Body, Catarrh, and
Asthma; and so perish as his Brother did in the like Case. Forestus, Lib. 10.
Observe, 75.

XIV. Of a light Apoplexy, at length turned into a Palsy.

1. A certain Person fell into an Apoplexy, and though by falling he seemed as
dead, he not snorting or making any Noise, it was such as was not to be cured
unless great Care and Pains had been taken.

2. After I came to him, and had used strong Frictions, Ligatures, and
Compressions; with a sharp Suppository; he began at length to speak, yet so as
that he could not be understood by any, wherefore after he could swallow, I
gave him Oxymel of Squills.

3. His Mouth being opened per Force, he drank off the the half of the
following Potion: Take Sage, Betony, Marjoram, Cowslips, of each one handful:
the flowers of Stoechas, one pugil: the seeds of Anise, and of Fennel, of each
one dram: the leaves of Sena, six drams: white female Agarick, one dram and
half: Raisons stoned, one ounce: Liquorice sliced, three drams: Boil them in
common Water for six ounces, make a strong Expression, and then add Oxymel
simple, and Syrup of Stoechas, of each one ounce: mix them for two Doses.

4. This Person having taken one of the Doses, he did spit mightily; and his
Apoplexy did seem to tend to a Palsy of one Side.

5. Secondly, I ordered the Nape and all down the Backbone to be anointed with
the Oils of Turpentine, of Juniper, and of Castoreum mixed together, and that
this Mixture should be often exhibited, of which he took frequently.

6. Take Conserves of the flowers of Sage, Betony, and Rosemary, of each half
an ounce: Mithridate, three drams: choice Treacle, half a dram: Syrup of
Stoechas, two ounces: simple Oxymel, half an ounce: make a Mixture.

7. His Urine was crude, which of its own accord did flow forth, he could now
make and retain it; yet it appeared to be warm and feverish, from whence I
hoped better of his Health, although he was sixty years of age; therefore I
gave him these Pills.

8. Take Pil. Aureae, one dram: with Syrup of Stoechas make five Pills: Another
day after, being full of humors, I did propose the rest of the above written
Potion, which with great easing asswaging of the Distemper did purge forth many
pituitous humors.

9. Afterward being paralytical in his left Side, and having great Pain in his
Head, his Face being also very red, and his Strength remaining, I ordered him
to be let blood in the Cephalic Vein of the Arm, which was not paralytical,
the Forehead and Temples being anointed with Ointment of Alabaster.

10. After this he had often feaverist Fits, by reason of which he had an
Aphtha, yet the Apoplexy may be better and more easily cured; by that unnatural
feverish Heat, though it thereby often ends in a Palsy; because of the Aphthas
he fell into the Hickkup, but by Gargarisms and other Medicines he was cured
thereof.

11. Thirdly, his Leg being a while longer anointed with the Oil of Turpentine,
of Foxes, of Lavender, and the Oil of Earthworms: he anointed afterward with
the Oils of Pepper, of Castoreum, and the like; and having continued in this
Method of Cure, yet nevertheless he fell sometimes through weakness.

12. Cornelius Ericius my Brother in Profession, went while the Ground was
covered over with Snow, to visit a certain Monk; when he had put off his
traveling Habiliments, and was putting on one of his Shoes, his Foot began
immediately to tremble, and his Clothes and Shoes being on, and passing through
a Church, all in a sudden fell into an Apoplexy, which presently ended in a
Palsy of the left Side, and had certainly fallen to the Ground, if he not been
supported by some that were in company with him.

13. Being carried to his Inn, I was brought to him, Frictions were used by a
Chyrurgion and then he was laid in a Bed; at length a Physician of the Hague,
who was his great Confident, coming to see him, he and I prescribed him the
following Pills; which we thought proper for him, because he did abound in
humors, although his Belly before he fell was loose enough.

14. Take Pil. Cochiae, two scruples: Castoreum, one scruple: with the Syrup of
Stoechas make four Pills: He took only two of them, because he had before a
Flux for a Month, they gave Purgation plentiful enough; about eight hours after
he took the other two, which did operate well, insomuch that he could
afterward both speak and understand better.

15. We did not draw from him any Blood, because his Belly had been before in a
good Temper; and his Strength somewhat dejected before he fell into the Apoplexy.

16. The Nape of the Neck and the Backbone were by our appointment anointed
with the following Oils: Take the Oil of Turpentine, of Castoreum, and
Lavender, of each half an ounce: mix them: By which there was a Resolution of
the Arm and Foot.

17. After three days there happening an Inflammation by a little Wheal or
Blister in his Skin, in the place of these we only used the Oil of Foxes; now
after the Pills were exhibited, he took twice or thrice, the true Treacle and a
Composition of Treacle, or an Elixir.

18. And although he began to recover, yet he kept his Bed as paralytical, till
the next Whitsunday: This Physician having at a time too liberally drunk Wine;
and coming from a Person that was sick lying in an upper Room; he fell and was
wounded in the hinder part of the Head, the Wound penetrating even the very
entrance of the Calvaria, and his Pericranium being much bruised, he died
within three weeks.

19. Also an ancient Chyrurgion was taken twice with an Apoplexy, which ended
in a Palsy, he with some advantage used the following Pill and Mithridate.

20. Take Pil. Cochiae, two scruple: Castoreum, one scruple: with the Syrup of
Stoechas make five Pills: his Memory decayed by little and little, and he made
use of a Staff because of the Palsy: and having a pretty while after taken his
Bed he lived some time, but yet miserably and at length dyed. Forestus. Lib: 10
Observe. 76.

XV. An Apoplexy arising from Phlegm degenerating into a Palsy.

1. A certain Tradesman being in the Feilds was suddenly taken with an
Apoplexy, and was carried home being without Sense and Motion, this Man
abounded in Phlegm.

2. We did not use Phlebotomy, for his Veins did not appear, now for the
driving and drawing away the Matter from the Head; this or the like following
Clyster was prescribed.

3, Take Centaury the lesser, Pennyroyal, Calamint, Origanum, Rue, Betony,
Sage, the Herb Mercury, Hysop, of each one handful: Bay Leaves, Stoechas,
Rosemary, of each one pugil: Aniseeds, Fennel, Carthamus bruised, of each two
drams: Raisons enucleated, one ounce: Colocynthis, half a dram: Boil them in a
sufficient quantity of Water, then take one pound of this Colature, to which
add the Electury of Hiera simple, Benedictum Laxativum, of each half an ounce:
Hiera Lagodii, Colocynthidos, of each one dram and half: the Oils of Cammomil,
Rue, of each one ounce: the Oil of Aniseeds, half an ounce: the Oil of
Castoreum, two drams and half: Salt Gem, and common Salt, of each one dram: mix
them, and make a Clyster.

4. In the Interim while the Clyster was preparing, the Belly was a little
stirred and irritated by the following Suppository: Take Troches-Alhandal, two
scruples: the Powder of the Species Hiera Picra simple, one scruple: a little
Salt, and a sufficient quantity of Honey make a Suppository.

5. I did use Frictions, and Bands to his Thighs and Arms because of the Palsy;
then I ordered the following Pills to be swallowed: Take Pil. Cochiae, one
dram: Castoreum, one scruple: make seven Pills: but because he could not
swallow them, I dissolved them in Sage-Water, to be poured into the Mouth:

6. Having loosned his Belly conveniently, he began to speak much better; I did
exhibit then Syrup of Stoechas, and Oxymel of Squills; afterward seeing he
could swallow much better, I prescribed the following Pills.

7. Take Pil. Cochiae, two scruples and half: Castoreum, half a scruple: with
the Syrup of Stoechas make five Pills: We did also anoint the Nape of his Neck
with the Oil of Elder and Nardinum mixed together.

8. Afterward we anointed the Pallat with Treacle and Mustard Seed beaten
together, Masticatories were also exhibited and Errhines made of the Juice of
Beets, Rue, and Marjoram; a Sternutatory after this manner: Take Nigella, white
Pepper, Nutmegs, of each one scruple: white Hellebor, Pyrethrum, Castoreum, of
each half a scruple: make a Powder: a little whereof is to be blown up the
Nostrils by a Quill.

9. Lastly, for a greater Resolution and strengthening of the Head we ordered
him to take Treacle, Mithridate, and Oxymel of Squills, and that he would use
the following Confection.

10. Take of the Conserves of the flowers of Rosemary, Betony, Sage, of each
half an ounces Confection of Mithridate, two drams: choice Treacle, one dram:
the Species Diamoschi, Diambrae, and Plirisarconticon of each one scruple and
half: Diacorus, two scruples: Oxymel of squills and Syrup of Stoechas, of each
half an ounce: mix them. And he may drink of this following Claret: Take Sage,
Marjoram, Hesop, Betony, of each one handful: the flowers of Rosemary, of
Stoechas, of each one pugil: Liquorice sliced, three drams. Boil them in nine
ounces of Water, add clarified Honey, and Syrup of Stoechas, of each one ounce:
clarify and aromatize it with three drams of choice Cinnamon, make a Compound
for three Doses.

11. Outwardly the whole Backbone it to be anointed, as also the Leg that is
paralytick with these Oils: Take Oil of Nard, and sweet Marjoram, of each one
ounce: the Oil of Foxes, half an ounce: the Oil of Cloves, five drops: when you
anoint, add some Aqua Vitae rectified: By these he was at length happily cured.
Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 77.

XVI, An Apoplexy arising from Melancholy.

1. A certain young Gentleman suddenly fell into an Apoplexy, which immediately
degenerated into a Palsy of the right Side, both of the Arm and Leg; by which
his Tongue was so much impeded, that he could scarcely speak or rightly
understand any thing.

2. A certain Physician of the C^ty of Mechlin did exhibit to this Person a
dram of choice Treacle with an ounce of Marjoram Water to cause him to sweat:
But I would rather have administered that after Purgation, according to
Rondeletius, because that it stops up many humors into the Head and augments
the Malady, this Man thinks it better to exhibit in the place of the Purge
Castoreum, two scruples: with a little Pepper or Ginger.

3. These following Things were prepared by me for the sick: Take Cinnamon, two
ounces: Ginger, half an ounce: Cardamoms, Cloves, Mace, of each one dram:
Water, six pounds: make a Decoction to the consumption of the half, adding so
much Sugar as may suffice for sweetning of it.

4. For his daily Drink this following was prescribed: Take Beets, Mallows,
Marshmallows, Sage, Betony, flowers of Cammomil, of each one handful: the
flowers of Arabian Staechas, one ounce: Rue, one handful: the leaves of Sena,
one ounce and half: Anise, Fennel, of each two drams: make a Decoction in one
pound of Water.

5. To the Colature add Benedictum Laxativum, one ounce: the Electuary of Hiera
Picra, half an ounce: the Oil of Orrice, and of Rue, of each an ounce: Honey of
Roses, one ounce: Salt, one dram and half: make a Clyster: the other Physician
and I coming to the sick, the said Clyster was injected by the advice of both,
by which he evacuated plentifully.

6. We gave him Directions to use a thin and moderate Diet, and for Drink that
which is above mentioned, and to abstain altogether from Wine: within a day or
two we ordered the aforesaid Clyster to be again repeated, by which he did void
much pituitous and melancholy Matter, on the day after it was determined that
the Nape of his Neck should be anointed with these Oils.

7. Take Oil of Elder, one ounce and half: the Oil of Spicknard, one dram and
half: mix them, and he did use this Confect: Take the Conserve of the flowers
of Betony, Sage, Rosemary, of each half an ounce: Nutmegs confected, two drams
and half: Confection of Mithridate, two drams: Oxymel of Squills, a sufficient
quantity: make a Confect.

8. But that which I had almost forgot was after the injection of the first
Clyster; I used Frictions, and after the operation of the first Clyster, a
fullness of Blood appearing in the Veins, out of the middle Vein in the Arm that
was whole, an indifferent quantity of Blood was taken; which tended to his
good; and after injection of the last Clyster a Gargarism was appointed, and a
Bag for his Head both for strengthening and warming of it, which are as follows.

9 Take white Mustard, one dram and half: the seeds of Peony, and the root of
the same, of each half a dram: Arabian Stoechas, two scruples: Misleto of the
Oak, two scruples and half: Boil them in a sufficient quantity of the Water of
Marjoram, strain them, then add to the Colature simple Oxymel of Squills, one
ounce: make a Gargarism.

10. Take Bay Leaves, Thym, Marjoram, of each half an handful: the flowers of
Rosemary, one handful: Rue, one pugil: Cloves, Stoechas, of each one dram: the
Powder of Calamint, one dram and half: cut, bruise, and shake them together:
then make a Bag of Cap for the Head, which shall com down to the Ears.

11. But before the above mentioned Gargarism and Cap for the Head were used,
we purged him with the following things: Take Caper-roots, half an ounce; the
roots of Peony, two drams: the seeds of Peony, one dram: Beet, Sage,
Bay Leaves, Marjoram, of each one handful: the flowers of Rosemary, of
Stoechas, of each one pugil: the seeds of Fennel, one dram: the leaves of Sena
cleansed from their stalks, Polypody of the Oak, of each one ounce: white
female Agarick, half an ounce: white Ginger, one scruple: Raisons stoned, one
ounce: make a Decoction in one pound of Water according to Art: Let the
Colature be aromatized with half an ounce of choice Cinnamon.

12. Take the above mentioned Decoction, four ounces: syrup of Betony and
Stoechas, of each half an ounce: mix them. By which Potion he had four Stools;
the next day, we did dissolve in another Dose half a dram of Pilulae Cochiae,
which did moderately purge: In the third Dose, we gave him one dram of Pilulae
Cochiae, and then he was sufficiently Purged, and began to grow always better
and better.

13. After these large Purgations, we came to use a Sudorifick, which was after
this manner: Take choice old Treacle, one dram: the Water of Marjoram, one
ounce: mix them, let it be taken very early, four or more hours before meat;
and it will cause an universal Sweat through the whole Body.

14. These things being had and done, we come now to give Directions about
anointing both of the Head and Feet, first after this manner: Take the Oil of
Elder, of Foxes, of Costus, of each one ounce: the Oil of Spicknard, two drams:
mix them. Take Aqua Vitae rectified, one ounce: the Water of Sage, half an
ounce: some drops of this Oil are to be mixed, when they are about anointing
the parts very early.

15. Afterward for better strengthening of the parts, seeing he found himself
every day much better, he took the following Potion every Morning: Take
Cinnamon, one ounce: Ginger, one ounce: Cloves, Nutmegs, of each one scruple:
boil them in almost one pound of Wine and Water, adding one ounce and half of
good Honey; mix them.

16. This following Claret he took for his daily drink: Take choice Cinnamon,
three ounces: white Ginger, two drams: Cloves, three scruples: boil them in
twelve pound of Marjoram-water: to the Consumption of a third part, to the
Colature add a sufficient quantity of the juice of Citron, and so much Sugar as
shall sweeten it.

17. A certain Lady told us, That Speech was restored to one that was
apoplectick and paralytick by Peony-leaves put under the Tongue, which we
agreed to, nevertheless by using continually Oxymel of Squils, and syrup of
Stoechas, with the mixtures of Conserves of Rosemary-flowers, Sage, the Species
Diambrae, the Species Diamoschi, and the like. He recovered his Speech; a good
Diet being also instituted.

18. Yet one could easily perceive by what he spoke, that he had been
grieviously afflicted with a severe Apoplexy.

19. Lastly, That an absolute Cure might be consummated, we prescribed the
following things for anointing the Paralytical Arm and Leg every Morning with a
long Frication: Take Sage, Bay Leaves, Marjoram, Poley, Calamint, Origanum, of
each two handfuls: the flowers of Rosemary, Stoechas, the Marrow of the Indian
Nut, Schaenanthus, Cyprus, Cloves, Galangal, Myrrh, the wood of Aloes, of each
three drams: Cinnamon, one ounce: the roots of the true Acorus: the roots of
Walwort, of each one ounce and half, Turpentine, one pound: shake them
together; and the Turpentine being put to, distill them in Balneum Maris with
Mallago Sack; to which add the Gum Elemi and Styrax Calamita, of each three
drams: Earthworms washed clean in Malago Sack, four ounces; by these Medicines
he was cured. Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 78.

XVII. Of an Apoplexy in a Man terminaing in a Palsy; occasioned by a wound in
the Head from an Arrow.

1. The fifth day of his Malady; having an Invitation from his Friends, I went
to see him, whom I found to be afflicted with an acute Fever, and the half of
his Body to be taken with a Palsy; he was also Dumb, he did Snort and had a
perpetual Drowziness and Sleepiness, neither could he feel when he was pricked.

2. Being informed; that he had lain five days in this lamentably bad
condition, to wit, Dumb, without Sense and Motion, and that he had not all that
time so much as one Stool; I ordered him the following Clyster for his Fever.

3. Take herb Mercury, Beets, Violets, Sage, Betony, red Colworts, Stoechas, of
each one pugil: Aniseed, two drams: Dill, one dram: make a Decoction in one
pound of Water; strain it, then add Diacatholicon, six drams: the Electuary of
Hiera Picra, half an ounce: Cassia, three drams: the Oil of Violets (because of
the Fever, and the hard faeces) the Oil of sweet Almonds, Camomil, of each one
ounce: the yolk of one Egg; Salt, one dram: mix them and make a Clister, by
which he did Evacuate thrice; the same day also I ordered Cupping-glasses with
Scarification to be put to his Shoulders, for diverting the Blood.

4. Immediately after the Injection of the Clyster, and the application of the
Cupping-glasses, (For by them a sufficient quantity of blood was drawn forth,
and the faeces purged) to the admiration of several persons, he began to speak,
yet the Palsy still remained in one side: But I had almost forgot to acquaint
you that there was a Resolution of the Bladder; of which I shall speak anon,
his Chyrurgeon proceeded after this manner.

5. He first infused Oil of Hypericon into the Wound, and then dipped a Cloth in
Oil of Roses made with the Addition of Wine, and applied hot to the Wound;
afterward he did cleanse, wipe off and consolidate. In the mean while, we
prescribed for his Fever the following things make a Decoction of Barley
cleansed, Endive, Succory, Lions-tooth, Betony, Damask Prunes, and the like;
the Syrup of Roses being added for sweetning; presently the following Julep was
ordered.

6. Take syrup of Endive, syrup of Succory with Rubarb, Honey of Roses, of each
half an ounce: the Waters of Endive, of Bugloss, of Betony, of Borrage, of each
two ounces; with half a dram of Diarrhodon Abbatis. Let it be aromatized
without Musk, it was twice repeated; and every day the following Suppository
was taken for keeping the belly soluble.

7. Take powder of Hiera Picra, one dram: Diagridium, Powder of Colocynthis, of
each three grains: a little Salt with a sufficient quantity of Honey; make a
Suppository; by the use of these Remedies he began to grow better; and because
he had an Aversion to drinking of Beer, I prescribed him this Julep for his
Thirst.

8. Take Betony-Water, one pound: Bugloss Water, two ounces: sugar Candy, boil
them. This he took for his Drink for the space of six or seven days; now
although he had Recovered his Speech, Sense and Motion, he fell afterward into
another Symptom, to wit, the Muscles of his Bladder, wanting strength, he could
not make Water.

9. Therefore I directed, that his Secret parts should be anointed with the Oil
of Scorpions; and that the following Emplaster be applied both to the Breast
and Privy-parts: Take green Pellitory, and green Chervil, of each two handfuls;
boil them in Water to a softness; being bruised, add of the Oil of Scorpions,
one ounce: fresh Butter, one ounce and half: mix them: make a soft Cataplasm to
be applied warm to the Breast; which being done, he presently rendered his Water.

10. And because of the Palsy in one side, which hindered him from Motion; I
enjoined the anointing of the nape of the Neck, the Backbone and Leg every
Morning with the Oil of Foxes, Camomil and Earthworms for strengthening of the
resolved Members, by which things even to Admiration he was perfectly cured.

XVIII. Of an Apoplexy by the Wound of an Arrow.

1. Another person who was young, by the Wound of an Arrow in the Crown of the
Head was taken with a light Apoplexy, which degenerated into a Palsy; who after
the use of a Decoction of Sage, Betony, and other Herbs proper for the Head, he
began to speak; there was some thing given him to take in at his Mouth, and also
a light Purgation of the leaves of Sena.

2. Other Herbs for the Head being also added, having often administered sharp
Suppositories, and ordering the Nape, Backbone down to the Buttocks to be
anointed always with the Oils of Castoreum, of Costus, and of Earthworms, he
was restored to his Health.

3. In the beginning of the Disease Cupping-glasses with Scarification were
applied both to his Shoulders and Nostrils; by these few Medicines he was
perfectly Cured of this Disease and of his Palsy. Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 79.

XIX. Of one in danger of falling into an Apoplexy by the Wound of an Arrow.

1. Another by the Wound of an Arrow in his Head, fell immediately into a
Swoon; but being come to himself again, I ordered a Chyrurgian to let him Blood
in the Cephalic Vein; least an Inflammation, Fever, Convulsion, Apoplexy, or
Palsy should follow.

2. Strong Clysters were given him, also Cupping-Glasses were applied to his
Shoulders; by which he was preserved from the Apoplexy, Carus, and Palsy.

3. A certain Countryman having received some hurt in his Head; by means
whereof he was afflicted with a great pain therein, and having too long
neglected the Cure; fell first into an Apoplexy, and torture of the Mouth;
afterward into a Palsy of one Arm and Leg; insomuch, that he could not move.

4. Being called to visit him, I ordered the following Medicines, by which he
was cured of the aforesaid Distempers: Take Oxymel of Squils, four ounces: as
often as he pleased; and let him drink instead of B^er the following Liquor
made of Honey.

5. Take choice Honey, three ounces: Water, one pound: choice Cinnamon, half an
ounce: make a Honey drink after the manner of Claret; afterward let him use
these Pills a good while after Supper.

6. Take Pilulae Cochiae, two scruples: Pilulae Auraea, Arabicae, of each half
a scruple: Troches Alhandal, two grains; with the syrup of Stoechas, make five
Pills: Also these following Troches were prescribed him. Take Mastich, two
scruples and half: Pyrethrum, one scruple and half: the seed of white Mustard,
one scruple: Staves-acre, half a scruple.

7. With the Oil of bitter Almonds, and a little Wax, make Troches of the
bigness of Ciches, every Morning before Meat let him Chew one or two of them
for almost half an hour; he may also take the bigness of a Chestnut of the
following Confect about three hours before Meat.

8. Take Conserves of the flowers of Rosemary, Betony, Sage, of each one ounce:
Mithridate, seven drams: Oxymel of Squils, syrup of Stoechas, of each one
ounce: mix them; his Arm and Leg that was Paralytical, the nape of his Neck
and Spinal were anointed with the following things.

9. Take Oil of Nardinum, one ounce and half: Oil of Foxes and of Earthworms,
half an ounce: the Oil of Rue, two drams: the Oil of Spicknard, one dram; mix
them; let there be added in the time of anointing some drops of Aqua Vitae
rectified; by following of these Medicines he was cured. Forestus, Lib. 10.
Observe. 79.

XX. Of an Apoplexy ending in a Palsy.

1. A very beautiful Woman was taken with a very strong Apoplexy about the
thirty fifth year of her Age; of temperament she was hot and indifferently
moist, somewhat inclining to Corpulency, having suddenly fell, she continued
Speechless for three days without Sense and Motion; on the third day, her
Apoplexy degenerated into a Palsy of the Left-side.

2. Also there was a Resolution of the Muscles of the Bladder; in so much that
for the space of three Weeks her Urine flowed forth while she was in bed; upon
which followed forgetfulness, a weak Memory, and a foolish Levity.

3. On the seventh day, from which she fell into this Distemper, I came to see
her, I found her under a stupifying and deep kind as it were of Sleep; neither
was she in her right Wits.

4. In the beginning a certain Chyrurgian having opened her Mouth, poured in
the water o^ Lavender before Evacuation, which without controversy did augment
the Malady by its Evaporation; and now her strength being decayed, and the
matter now flowing, we did forbear the breathing of a Vein, which would not
have been inconvenient at the beginning.

5. So after a week was over, the following Suppository, by which she did
evacuate twice, was ordered: Take the powder of the Species of Hiera Picra, two
scruples: Agarick, one scruple: the powder of Colocynthis, Diagridium, three
grains: Honey, a sufficient quantity, with a little Salt, make a Suppository.

6. After that we commanded that Cuppingglasses with Scarification should be
put to the right Nostril and right Shoulder, both which were free from the
Palsy.

7. Blood being drawn from both, she found her self much better, Frictions
being also used in the Paralytick side: The day following we prescribed these
things to be used.

8. Take Centory the lesser, Betony, Marjoram, Sage, of each one handful: the
flowers of Camomil, of Melilot, of Stoechas, of each half an handful: Beet,
Mercury, of each one pugil: Polypody of the Oak, the Marrow of the seeds of
Carthamus, of each half an ounce: Agarick tied up in a linen rag, one dram and
half: Colocynthis tied after the same manner, one dram: Aniseeds, two drams:
make a Decocoction for one pound, strain, and dissolve in the Colature, the
Electuary of Hiera Picra simple, Benedictum Laxativum, of each half an ounce?
Honey of Roses, one ounce and half: Oil of Camomil, two ounces: the Oil of Rue,
one ounce: common Salt, one dram and half: the yolks of two Eggs, sal Gem, half
a dram: make a Clyster.

9. By this she did plentifully evacuate four times, phlegmatic melancholy
matter, much of the color of Ashes; after this she began to stir and get out
of her sound, deep sleep, and take somewhat in at her Mouth.

10. Yet she remaining still stupid and foolish, the following Decoction was
given her. Take Betony, (for the juice thereof it is said will restore Speech
again) Sage, of each one handful: the flowers of Stoechas, Rosemary, Cowslips,
of each half an handful: Make a Decoction in the water of Betony, Cowslips and
Wall flower distilled in Balneo Mariae, of each six ounces to one pound of the
Colature, adding Honey of Roses strained, three ounces; Aromatize them with the
powder of Diambrae and choice Cinnamon, of each half a dram: Clarify it, and
then let her take at three several times.

11. Afterward she took of the following Syrup. Take the Decoction of Betony,
Sage, of each six ounces; syrup of stoechas, and Honey of Roses strained, of
each one ounce and half: mix them.

12. In the mean while she took the bigness of a Chestnut of this Confect every
Morning, Take Conserves of the flowers of Rosemary, Citron-peels candied, of
each one ounce: the powder of the root of Acorus, the species Diambrae, the
species, Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each two drams: the powder of Castoreum, one
scruple; with Oxymel simple; make a Confect.

13. Another Clyster was again Injected, and we anointed the Spinal, then the
paralytical Arm and Leg, with the following Ointment: Take the Oil of
Earthworms, of Foxes, of each one ounce: the Oil of Rue, the Oil of Camomil, of
Pepper-wort, of each half an ounce: Wax, a sufficient quantity; make an
Ointment.

14. The besmearing of the Spinal was of efficacy to cause her to retain her
Urine; afterward we gave the third time a Clyster, by which she began to move
her Members much better, and to recover in some measure her lost Wit and Speech.

15. And having taken Treacle, we ordered the third day five Clysters; at
length she began to grow hot and feverish; which we took to be no bad sign,
warmer Medicines being left for a time, Tablets of Diarrhodon were used.

16. She now growing by degrees better and better, returned into Alcmaria; whom
I enjoined the strict observation of a good Diet, her Fever now left her.

17. After a while they write to me, that she could now walk by the help of a
Staff; but that her Memory was not yet recovered: To whom I writ back again,
That she should take the following Pills; having again prescribed a Decoction
made of Herbs proper for the Head.

18. Take Pilulae foetidae, Pilulae Cochiae, of each half a dram: Castoreum,
half a scruple: with the syrup of Stoechas, make five Pills to be taken after
midnight; also I ordered to be added to her Ointment, more of the Oil of
Pepper-wort, Turpentine and Castoreum; by which for some time the Paralytical
Members were anointed.

19. I had occasion to travel that way, and found her well and going upright,
having thrown away her Crutches; nevertheless, her Memory was much weakened, yet
by the blessing of God upon these Medicines; she was restored to good Health.
Forestus, Lib. 10. Observe. 81.

XXI. A deadly Apoplexy from a Concussion of the Brain.

1. Among the proper means for removing and overcoming this Disease, we looked
on letting of Blood as one, therefore first we did take seven or eight ounces
of Blood out of the right Arm, because there was some ground of suspicion that
the Concussion of the Brain did proceed from the blood flowing thither.

2. After this was done, he could more freely breath, yet no sensible change
did follow of the rest of the parts; we also ordered Frictions and strong
Ligatures, and a little while after the following Clyster.

3. Take the leaves of Betony, Sage, Primrose, Centory the lesser, wild
Calamint, of each one handful and half, the leaves of Sena, six drams: the pulp
of Colocynthis, one dram and half: boil in Water and Wine, to the consumption
of the third part; strain it, then add the Electuary of Hiera simple, Indi
Majoris, of each half an ounce: Sal Gem, half a dram: mix them and make a
Clyster.

4. Besides these Remedies of Revulsion, we did not neglect the affected part.
Wherefore Secondly, We did infuse the Apoplectick Water of Langius, mixed with
the Spirit of black Cherries, and we did cause the top of the Head, Temples and
Nostrils to be bathed with the Oil of Amber.

5, Lastly, To excite Nature, Sternutatories of Castoreum and the like were
given, but all in vain, for he died. Horstius, Tom. 2. Lib. 2. Observe. 13.

XXII. Out of Horstius against the Apoplexy.

1. For preservation, Take seeds of Rocket and Carraway covered over with
sugar, they must be taken every day.

2. Item, After universals, Take Cresses Rocket, of each one dram: Staves-Acre,
Cubebs, of each half a dram: the roots of Pyrethrum, Ginger, of each one
scruple; with Oxymel make an Electuary for anointing of the Palate.

3. Item, Perches Eyes, one dram: are to be taken often in Rosemary-Wine.

4. Item, Take the Oil of Carraway-seeds, three grains: Ambergrise, three
grains: Sugar, two ounces: with the Water of black Cherries, make a Confection
in Rowls.

5. Item, Take the Golden Water of Langius every Morning, one spoonful; and the
Anhaltine Water with Musk, for the Nostrils.

6. Item, Take white Amber prepared, two drams: the Species of Diarrhodon
Abbatis, half a dram: Pliresarchonticon; the root of Male-Peony, of each one
scruple: make a powder, and take one dram thereof, about the time of the new
Moon, with the Water of the flowers of the Tile-tree, or Lilly-convally.

7. Item, The Seeds of Carraway and Rocket are to be taken covered over with
Sugar; the Oil of Carraway half a scruple by it self, is given to persons that
are troubled with Wind.

8. Item, Take white Amber, the species of Diarrhodon Abbatis, of each one dram
and half: Ambergrise, four grains: mix them for a powder. Dose half a dram.

9. In the accession of the fit, rub the Jaws with Water of Treacle and
Mithridate, Conserve of Rosemary flowers the Confection of Alkermes, and the
like; let there be applied to the Nostrils the Apoplectick Balsam, as also Rue,
Nigella, Amber, and the like; a sharp Clyster is to be given, and afterward so
soon as it can be done, Diaphoreticks, and Lapis Bezoar, ten grains in Black
Cherrie-Water, mixed with the Spirit of Lilly Convally must be given. Gregorius
Horstius, Tom. 3. Page 195.

XXIII. An Apoplexia, or privation of the Animal Function in a noble Virgin.

1. A noble Virgin sixty years of Age, was taken with the Apoplexy, by a fall
on a Logg of Timber, whereby her Head, and the first Vertebrae of her Neck was
hurt. A few days hereafter the Appetite was lost, and the Animal Actions began
to be disturbed; upon which followed great numbness of the Feet and Hands; in
so much, that she complained, as if she had on hands; sometimes she did cry out
most bitterly.

2. It was not to be doubted, but that the original of this Malady did proceed
by consent from the Spinal Marrow; when I came to see her, she then complained
to me of a pain in the hinder part of the Neck, and that she could not sleep;
to whom I prescribed this bag boiled in Wine and Water.

3. Take the flowers of Camomil, Melilot and Elder, of each one handful: the
leaves of Sage, Marjoram, Rosemary, Spicknard, Ground Ivy, Origanum, of each
half an handful: Juniper Berries, one ounce and half: being cut and bruised
make a Bag for use; with this following Ointment, I also anointed the Nape of
the Neck.

4. Take Oil of Earthworms, one ounce: Oil of Bricks, three drams: of Dill, of
Cammomil, of each two drams: of Costus, one dram: of Spicknard, two scruples:
the Ointment of Marshmallows, two drams: a little of the Oil of Hypericon may
be added, with some Wax, make an Ointment,

5. Her Belly being bound I ordered her to take for many days the following
Purgation, Take Extract of Mechoacan compounded, Diagridium, Alhandal,
Cambogia, of each one grain: Pil. Rudii, five grains: make five Pills, with two
drops of the Oil of Citrons: It did operate five times.

6. Inwardly, I did exhibit four drops of the following Oils every Morning in
Broth: Take Oil of Rosemary-flowers, four and twenty drops, of Marjoram, of
Lavender, of each six drops: of Oranges, four drops: of Anise, of Fennel, of
each eight drops: mix them: She took it in Rosemary-Wine.

7. By these she had great profit, but at length being seized with a
Convulsion, she dyed. Grulingius Curat. 7. Cent. 1.

XXIV. An Apoplexy in old Age.

1. This Disease sometimes happens in extreme old Age, or in Men, in whom the
vigor of the Senses is small through the Defect of the Spirits; and because the
continual defatigation of the Brain may occasion a cold Intemperature,
therefore the use of these Medicines may greatly comfort.

2. Take the Spirit of the best and most pleasant Wine, one pound and half: to
which put the leaves of Bawm, the flowers of Lavender, Lilly-Convally, of
Rosemary, of Borrage, of each one handful: Grains of Paradise, two drams:
Cubebs, Cinnamon, Nutmegs, of each one dram: Let them stand, the Vessel being
well closed, that nothing may evaporate, afterward strain them out by
pressing, and let the expression be kept for use: In Winter when the Air is
colder, every Month about the Conjunction of the Moon dip a piece of white
Bread in half a dram of this Spirit and let him swallow it in the Morning,
sleeping a little thereafter.

3. In Summer he may take of the Water of Lilly-Convally or Carduus Benedictus,
likewise about the new Moon one dram of the following Powder: Take white Amber,
and grind it on a marble St^^e with the Water of black Cherries, to this Powder
add as much of Diarrhodon Abbatis.

4. These two Medicines are profitable, for they correct the humors and check
the Vapors, and remove the Obstruction: As to Diet great Care must be had,
therefore all Meats must be shunned which breed pituitous and phlegmatic humors,
such as Fish, Pot Herbs, things made of Milk, and Meats fried, sometimes Pills
may be taken of Alephanginae, or Mastich, or Aloes Rosata.

5. It is most convenient also that the melancholy humor be evacuated and
corrected by proper Medicines, a better way of evacuating this humor cannot be
than by the Hemorroids, Fomentations also are to be applied, made of the
Decoction of Mallows and Lin-seed and inwardly a scruple of Aloes Rosata is to
be taken.

6. This melancholy humor is to be contemperated by the use of the Extract of
the Juice of Bawm and Borrage, and a spoonful of the following Syrup before
Dinner or Supper may be taken.

7. Take Syrup of the Juice of Bawm, three ounces: of the Juice of Borrage, two
ounces: of the Peels of Citrons, half an ounce: the Species Aromatici Rosati,
one dram: Diamoschi dulcis, as much: mix them: and let it be given in a Glass,
for repressing the Vapors; after Meat this Powder may be taken.

8. Take Coriander prepared, one ounce: choice Cinnamon, two drams: Mastich,
one scruple: Mace, half a scruple: white Bread toasted, three ounces: white
Sugar, half a pound: mix them and make a Powder: In the Morning the Person may
take from a quarter of an ounce to half an ounce of the Confection with the Oil
of Anise, the Oil of Caraway, Amber, also a Confect of Diamoschi dulcis and
Diambrae, and sometimes Treacle and Mithridate; if these things be followed,
great Benefit will accrue to the Person. Crato apud Sholzium, Cons. 35.

XXV. Of an Apoplexy.

1. The Disease of the Apoplexy is nothing else, but an Obstruction in the
Original of the Nerve, or Brain, whereby the Passages of the animal Spirits,
which give Motion to the whole Body, are shut up and the Heart is hindered to
distribute and diffuse the vital Spirits; from whence there comes a Resolution
of the whole Body, and is deprived of Sense and Motion as the Heart of
Respiration.

2. The proper Note and Chararcteristicon of this affect is known by
Respiration, which according as is more or less suppressed, the Danger is so
much the greater or lesser.

3. We must first consider from whence the animal Spirits are thus impeeded;
the causes are many and various; yet they may be included under these four; the
first, is the bad Temper of the Brain, which does not presently invade for the
Imbecility of the Brain and of the animal Faculties, the Understanding and
Memory will be felt long before, as also a Numness, Somnulency, Anger,
Oblivion, with a pain in the Head, and Noise in the Ears.

4. If the Apoplexy be expected to flow from that Fountain, then it will be
needful to strengthen the Brain, and the Brain if possible is to be purged by
the Nostrils, moreover you may purge the Brain by an Apophlegmatismus; every
Morning the Mouth is to be washed by Sage-Water with Salt, and you may use
every day this Confect which will refresh the Spirit.

5. Take Species Diambrae, Species Diamoschi, of each one dram: Sugar dissolved
in Lavender-Water, make a confection in little Balls: you may eat one of them
every Morning, and you may rub the Almonds of the Ears with Rosemary-Water: let
him often chew Rocket and Caraway seed.

6. This Remedy will be greatly useful for an Apoplexy arising from a second
cause, to wit, from the obstruction of the Brain by a gross and viscid Phlegm;
in this case let him swallow the bigness of a Bean every day of Treacle and
Mithridate.

7. Aniversary Purgations will be useful, as also daily Frictions first in the
Hands and Feet, and then in the Back.

8. A third cause proceeds from thick gross Vapors disturbing the Spirits; for
by bad Diet which generates those Vapors the Head is filled and the Spirits
are corrupted and dissolved, and this grievous Affect is generated; also
Drunkards and great Wine Bibbers are very obnoxious to this Disease.

9. The Brain is preserved from thick Vapors by observing diligently a good
Diet; too much Sleep, Banqueting, and fumous Meats are to be avoided; the seed
of Caraway and Rowls made of the Oil of Caraway and Anise are good for removing
the Vapors; and by washing of the Feet in the Morning and Frictions, the
Vapors are much diverted; Care must be had that Crudities be not accumulated
in the Stomach, for which Ambergrise is good.

10. A fourth cause is from the too great plenty of Blood, or of Phlegm, or of
Melancholy: if from Blood, then beware of such things as do much augment is, a
Vein must be opened, and Cupping-Glasses affixed to diminish the excessive
quantity of the Blood.

11. But if from Phlegm or Mela^choly, then these humors must be purged by
exhibiting Sena: the Brain is to be strengthened, the Nostrils are to be
anointed with the Oil of Sage, and Rosemary-Water is to be drawn up through the
Nostrils; and the following Gargarism is to be administered in order to draw
away the Phlegm out of the Nostrils.

12. Take the roots of Pyrethrum cut, one dram: Ginger also cut, half a dram:
boil them in Water, then add Rosemary, Rue, of each one handful: in the boiling
a third part must be consumed, strain it, and to the Colature add a little of
the Vinegar of Roses, wash therewith the Mouth and gargarize it.

13. Make use for Smelling of the seed of Caraway tied up in some Cloth, which
is to be dipped in the Vinegar of Roses; use Treacle well compounded; make clean
and mundify the Head with a Sponge dipped in Sage or Rosemary-Water; in the
Morning wash the Feet with the Decoction of Betony, and every new Moon, or full
Moon, take inwardly one dram of white Amber, with a grain of Ambergrise in
Betony or Rosemary-Waters.

14. Aqua Vitae rightly prepared is not to be rejected, especially if there be
no sanguinary Repletion; in this case a Vein is to be seasonably opened, and
strong Clysters are to be given, such as of Centaury the lesser: strong
Frictions and Sternutatories are to be used.

15. A learned Physician did advise a thin piece of Cypress to be applied to
the Head and it would avail much. But if the Apoplexy degenerate into a Palsy;
and should at length grew inveterate; strong Purgatives must not be given at
first, but rather the Original of the Nerves is to be succored; I think the
Physician will then bestow his Labor in vain. Crato apud Scholzium, Cons. 36.

XXVI. Of an Apoplexy.

1. Seeing it is very evident that in this Disease the Brain is made much
colder; therefore it is convenient that something may be taken every day which
will refresh the animal Spirits and the natural heat and keep the Brain in a
good Temperament.

2. For effecting of which Ambergrise is most convenient, or rather the
following Rowls to be taken every day: Take Sugar dissolved in Rose Water, four
ounces: Oil of Anise distilled, threedrops: Ambergrise, four grains: mix them
and make a Confection in Rowls: Or you may use these following: Take species
Diambrae, species Diamoschu dulcis, of each one dram: white Sugar dissolved in
Borrage-Water, four ounces: the Oil of Anise distilled, two drops: mix and make
a confection in Rowls.

3. Let him often keep a bit of Nutmeg toasted in his Mouth; for that will
contribute much to the correcting of the cold Temper of the Brain, let him wash
his Head every Night before Supper and then be sure not to expose it to the Air.

4. In the Lie you may boil Marjoram, Rosemary, and Roses, and you may put
therein Sapo Medicatus made after this manner: Take Venice or Spanish-Soap, one
pound: roots of Orrice, yellow Sanders, of each one dram and half: Ambergrise,
half a scruple: the Oil of Cloves, three drops: dissolve the Soap in the water
of Roses and mix them together.

5. Let him cleanse his Tongue well every Morning and wash the Mouth with Rose
or Lavender-Water; with which mix the common Water; with the same Water wash
behind the Ears; abstain from all things that bred Vapors; such as things made
of Milk, Onions, Leeks, Pot Herbs, Pease, and Beans.

6. Another cause does agree to the former, which was the cold Temper of the
Brain, to wit, an abundance of the pituitous humor too much moistning the Brain
and Spirit; old Men and those who are troubled with many Crudities are most
obnoxious to this Disease and the reason is, the Brain in such being
debilitated, by many Actions, does generate but few Spirits and those very
weak; whereby the Senses become stupefied, and the Motion slow and infirm.

7. The natural Heat being weak, cannot digest and overcome the humors, and so
there happens a redundancy of the humor; which causes them to be more
inclinable to this Distemper, and to be much worse in Winter than they are at
any other time.

8. Now that this phlegmatic humor may not thicken, besides the Remedies we
have recited which are very agreeable, it will be convenient after eating to use
this following Peptick and Stomatick Powder.

9. Take white Bread toasted, three ounces: Coriander prepared, one ounce,
choice Cinnamon, Galangal, of each one dram: Mastich, half a scruple: white
Sugar, half a pound: mix them and make a Powder: Likewise for the same
Intention it will be profitable to use the Confection of Quinces with the
Species of Galen.

10. It would not be amiss to put the seeds of Caraway into your Bread, for the
smell as well as the eating thereof is very much commended.

11. You may dip also a linen Cloth or a Spong in the Oil of the same
distilled; and in the Morning hold it often to your Nose to smell to; he may
take in the Morning Caraway and Rocket-seed reduced into Powder with Sugar, or
one of these following Rowls.

12. Take Sugar dissolved in Rose and Lavender-Water, three ounces: the Oil of
Caraway-seed distilled, three drops: Ambergrise, three grains: mix them and
make a Confection in Rowls.

13. And least Nature should be accustomed to one thing only, the Medicines may
be changed; so that sometimes these Rowls and Powder may be used: Take Sugar
dissolved in Betony-Water, three ounces: Oil of Amber, three drops: the Powder
of white Amber, half a scruple: mix them and make a Confection in Rowls.

14. This following Powder is of great account: Take the root of Seseli
Cretici, one dram: the seed of Rocket, Cardamon, and white Pepper, of each two
scruples: mix them and make a subtle Powder: take the quantity of a Bean every
Morning, or let Powder be mixed with the Syrup of Betony; make an Electuary, of
which take the bigness of a Filbirt.

15. It will be very profitable sometimes to evacuate the phlegmatic humor by
Pill or Pills of Mastich, one dram to be taken before Meat; Frictions of the
whole Body and Washings of the Feet every Morning in a Decoction of Betony are
convenient; as also Gargarisms for purging of the Brain, which are to be thus.

16. Take Rosemary, Periwinkle, Rue Origanum, Sage, of each one pugil: Ginger,
Pyrethrum, of each one dram and half: the roots of Burdock the greater, four
scruples: Boil them in two pounds of Water to the consumption of a third part;
strain, then add the sharpest Vinegar of Roses, a sufficient quantity: and let
it be kept in a Glass-Bottle.

17. This Gargarism is to be used in the Morning; for it is very good for
purging both of Mouth and Tongue, for drawing forth the pituitous humor and
strengthening the Brain; and to attract the humors by the Nostrils.

18. Marjoram-Water wherein the seeds of Rocket bruised, and a little Mastick
are macerated, is of use.

19. A third Cause Physicians assign, is thickness and repletion of the blood;
by the irruption whereof the Channels of the Brain, the Carotidal Arteries and
the Reins are filled.

20. For in the dissection of apoplectick dead Bodies there is found a clot of
blood fallen into the Carotides; those to which this Malady happens, according
to Hippocrates, are commonly between the years of forty and sixty, in which
time the melancholy humor is most vigorous.

21. From whom, says that Oracle, nothing can be more convenient than the
coming of the Hemorrhoids, and that all Care be taken to keep them running; for
while they run, there is no doubt of the present Safety: But if that cannot be
done; the next thing, to wit, by Cupping-Glasses and breathing of a Vein the
Blood must be drawn forth.

22. Although there is some help to be had by the extraction of the Blood; yet
if the Foeculency of the Blood be not carried off, they will not answer the
End; and the more frequent the letting of blood is, the Blood is thereby cooled
and the Spirits exhausted; therefore it must be done with a great deal of
Caution.

23. For Hippocrates does not absolutely assign and impute the Cause of the
Apoplexy to Blood, Melancholy and Phlegm; but rather advises to abstain from
such things as will breed not only a plenty of Blood, but also a gross
thickness of the same.

24. Luscious and impure Wines and immoderate Repetions do suffocate and
extinguish the natural Heat; the Wine of Carduus Benedictus is good, as also
Vinum Medicatum made of the Infusion of Sena; this Wine must not be taken at
Meat, as also other Medicaments because they trouble and hinder the Concoction,
and so the Chyle being crude excites and sends up Fumes to the Head whereby the
Spirits of the Brain are wasted and corrupted.

24. But if it be taken about an hour before Meat, I do not see why it should
not do good: For Sena does wonderfully purge the Organs of the Senses and
strengthens the Stomach; the Infusion of Sena or rather our Syrup of Apples
with Sena will be more convenient.

26. The Infusion is thus: Take Currants, six drams: Galangal, one dram: the
flowers of Borrage, Violets, of each one pugil: boil them in a sufficient
quantity of pure Water, in the Decoction infuse the leaves of Sena, six drams:
then strain and take of the Expression four ounces, to which add Manna
Calabrina, six drams: Syrup of conserved Ginger, one dram: mix them and make a
Drink to be taken every day.

27. If he would use the Syrup of the Juice of Apples and Sena, he may take one
ounce, wherewith he may mix half a scruple of Mace, now if the Body be not
already loose you may make it so, if the day before you use the Infusion of
Sena or the Syrup, you must be careful to apply a Clyster made of the Decoction
of Pauls-Betony in the Broth of a Cock or Capon, with the addition of a little
Sugar.

28. There is also this to be observed, that none who is apprehensive of
falling into this Malady, should presently go to bed after Supper, but that
there be two or three hours between supping and sleeping.

29. Among the principal causes of the Apoplexy, Hippocrates recites a forth,
which is when the animal Virtue, which influences both Sense and Motion, is
impeded and the natural heat is through the want thereof suppressed and almost
extinguished.

30. This happens chiefly to those that are obnoxious to Crudities, too much
Gluttony and surfeiting, and while thus, he should rather use Exercise than
Rest.

31. For by Abstinence and exercise (by which says Celsus a most famous
Physician, he cured many Diseases) such are preserved.

32. He ought not to sleep immediately after eating, and if he should begin to
be drowsy, he ought by some of the Family to be stirred up, and rather excited
to some pleasant Exercises than be suffered to sit or lie down: for moderate
Exercise is healthful.

33. He should not much use Venery, nor wast himself that way; for the
immoderate use thereof debilitates the Head and Brain.

34. For the most part there goes before this Disease a Vertigo, the which
indeed presages, his Disease to be near, which though present, yet bespeaks it
not dangerous.

35. Those Medicines therefore which (a little before) I have recited, I use;
but in the first place I exhibit the little Lozenges made with the chemical
Oil of Caraways, least the evil Matter should obstruct, and creat thick
Vapors, which might hinder the force of other things to be given.

36. Such things as correct those Vapors, which infect the Brain, by their
Odor and pleasant Vapor, are very profitable; you must also boil Caraways and
Amber in Water, and take the Vapors up the Nostrils, and a piece of toasted
Nutmeg must be taken into the Mouth, to which let some Ambergrise be added, and
Castoreum put in Vinegar, is to be held to the Nostrils.

37. If a continual intermitting Fever attend this Disease, it needs no other
Cure; if it be weak, it increases the Malady, if too strong, it destroys the
Strength; for the Danger lies in the Excess.

38. There are some causes in which there is no place for Medicines, such as
extreme Cold, a Blow hurting the Channels and Ventricles of the Brain, sudden
Joy, great Anger and Indignation, Commotion of the Mind, Astonishment by
Thunder; by these, Persons become Apoplectick.

39. If a great Apopolexy attend these, there can be no other reason of the
Cure than that which is from obstructing Causes.

40. If it ends in a Palsy, we must use those helps which tends to a
Resolution; when the Apoplexy begins, some are for letting of blood all on a
sudden; but this is for certain; if it does not free the Person, it will surely
kill.

41. Some greatly approve of a Suffumigation made of Amber, but learned
Physicians think without reason.

42. Sternutatories are dangerous, yet may be profitable if applied in due
time; the Powder of the Root of Nightshade with Rue, Castoreum and Ginger, an
equal Part, to be blown up the Nostrils.

43. It will be good to shake the superior Parts, chiefly the Neck: It will be
convenient to put to the Head a thin piece of Cypress, or the Head being shaved
to apply a Cupping-glass to the Crown of the Head: sharp Clysters are to be
given.

44. The difference of the Pulse in a cold swooning, and in an Apoplexy
consists in this, that in the former the Pulse is weak, in the latter the Pulse
is full and strong, unless in the very point of Death.

45. But if the apoplectick Person lies without Sense and Motion; and spiration
with snorting is violent and inequal, then there is nothing but Death to be
expected. Crato apud Scholzium, Cons. 37.

XXVII. For the Apoplexy.

1. Take Pil. Cochiae, two scruples, Castoreum, one scruple: Troches of
Alhandal, three grains: with Oxymel of Squills make eight Pills, which may be

clarified and aromatized, of which one may take every Morning six ounces.

3. Take fresh Castoreum, two drams: the Ashes of Maiden hair, one dram,

drams: Sugar of Roses tabulated, a sufficient quantity: make a Mixture: of
which after eating take one spoonful.

8. Let him abstain from Wine because of the Fumes which sends it up the Head,
as also because of a Fever. Albertinus Bottonus apud Scholzium, Cons. 325.

XXVIII. An Apoplexy from Blood.

1. A plethorick Woman, red colored, a Ministers Wife, going to Market and
taking up Money that lay upon the Table, fell suddenly; she bleed at Mouth and
Nose, and died presently.

2. This I saw in another, and in diverse others at the point of Death;
sometimes after they were newly dead; the cause of this I showed to be from
Blood. Plat. Observe. Lib. 1. Page 14.

XXIX. An Apoplexy by a fall.

1. A Countryman coming home from the City, having sufficiently wet his Palate
with Liquor, fell down by the way, and could not rise nor speak, he was carried
home, but all imputed this Accident to his Drunkenness.

2. The next day, after the drunken fit was over, he remained Dumb, and one
side resolved with the Palsy, and the other was hot.

3. And because I thought it came from Blood, I advised Phlebotomy; but it was
neglected because they alleged he was too weak to be let Blood, then I
commanded that his body should be well rubbed.

4. And because he had difficulty in Breathing, his Breast was ordered to be
anointed with the Resumptive Ointment.

5. At length he began to hawk out blood, and take broth, but he was very hot.
Therefore I gave him the following Julep: Take syrup of Vinegar, Bugloss,
Violets, of each an ounce: Primrose and Chervil Water, of each two ounces; let
him drink it at twice Morning and Evening.

6. The Night before he had a Suppository: he opened a Vein in his Arm, and the
day following took this Purge. Take Rubarb, a dram: Mummy, a scruple: Electuary
of juice of Roses, a dram and half with Chervil-water: the next day, he took
Conserve of Rose and Prim-roses, and so was perfectly cured. Platerus, Lib. 1.
Page 15.

XXX. A sudden Apoplexy.

1. An old man fell suddenly in the Street, void of Sense and Motion, and was
Dumb; I gave him a little Elixir Vitae, made of many Infusions, which was by
drops put into his Mouth; he had also a sharp Suppository, and the day
following he could swallow again.

2. I gave him the Elixir Vitae again with Lavender-water. And the next day
this Potion: Take Tablets of Diacarthamum of my description, two drams:
Diagridium, half a scuple: with Lavender and Sage-water, make a small Potion.
He purged well with it, and came well to himself.

3. I also advised this Hydromel: Take Honey and Water, and Rocket-seed, a
dram: boil them, he drank it for his Wind, and was perfectly cured. Platerus,
Observe. Lib. 1. page 15.

XXXI. An Apoplexy from a fluid or moist dissolved Brain.

1. An old Woman of Montpessul, was suddenly taken with an Apoplexy, and died.

2. We opened her Head, in the Monastery, and found that in the thick film or
Meninx, her brain did swag too and fro; and when the Dura Matter was opened,
there ran over all her Face, a thick Liquor like white broth, and stuck in
rags upon it; this Case and its Causes I showed. Platerus, Observe. Lib. 1. Page
16.

XXXII. The fear of an Apoplexy from a Heaviness and Fluctuation in the Head.

1. A strong noble Man who lived intemperately, feared an Apoplexy, by reason
of a certain heaviness of his Head, and fluctuation, as if his Head was great
and empty, and opened and shut like a Purse; sometimes he was bad, at other
times better (as to his Head) but in other respects he was well, except
melancholy and dull.

2. I judged it to proceed from phlegm and water in the Skull by many
circumstances. I bid him be of good cheer, because he was young; he promised
obedience, and I ordered this following.

3. Take Diaphoenicon, two drams: Diacatholicon, half an ounce: syrup of Roses
solutive, an ounce: with a little Cinnamon Water, make a Potion, it wrought
indifferent well.

4. The day after the Vein in his Arm was opened; for he was square bodied and
Plethorick.

5. Then he had this Apozem: Take Fennel-roots, one ounce: Orrice, half an
ounce: Acorus, Cyprus, Elecampane, each two drams: Liquorice, six drams:
Fennel, Vervain, Eyebright, Betony, Fumitory, of each an handful: Time, Hysop,
of each an handful and half: Stoechas, Rosemary, Borage-flowers, each a pugil:

each a dram: Raisons, ten pair; Sena, two ounces: Polypody, Carthamus-seeds, of
each an ounce: Turbith, two drams: Rubarb, a dram and half: Cinnamon, two
drams: Spike, a dram: with sugar and Cinnamon, make an Apozem; he drank it four
times, and it wrought very well.

6. He had three Cupping-glasses to both sides of his Neck and Shoulders, with
Flame in the Morning thrice, and the fourth time with Scarification: These with
the Purge was to make Revulsion; after that he was thus purged.

7. Take Orrice-root, half an ounce: Liquo rice-roots, an ounce: Sage,
Marjoram, of each an handful: Lavender and Rosemary flowers, of each a pugil:
Raisons stoned, an ounce: Sena, half an ounce: Aniseeds, a dram:
Carthamus-seeds, two drams: boil, strain; add Tables of Diacarthamum, a dram:
syrup of Roses solutive, with Cinnamon, make a Potion; he was purged soundly,
and found ease in his Head.

8. And he snuffed up this following into his Nose: Take juice of Marjoram,
roots of Beets, Brooklime, of each half an ounce: powder of Pellitory-roots, a
dram: White Wine, two drams: mix them.

9. He took Tablets of Nutmegs, a dram and half sometimes, and drank after it
Marjoram and Mint-water, mixed with Wine.

10. After Dinner he had this Powder: Take Coriander Comfits, an ounce:
Anniseeds, half an ounce: Fennel-seeds, two drams: Carraway, Cubebs candied, of
each a dram: Marjoram, red Roses, each a dram and half: Cinnamon, two drams:
Mace, half a dram: Diacydonium without the species, a dram: with sugar as much
as all.

11. He had this Nightcap: Take Orrice-roots, Angelica, of each two drams:
Calamus, Cypress, of each a dram: Marjoram, Rosemary-flowers, Roses, Lavender,
of each half a dram: Nutmegs, Cloves, of each a dram: Coriander seed, a dram
and half: Gith seed, half a dram; make a Powder for a Cap: by these he was
better.

12. But because the heaviness was sometimes in his Head, I purged him again
thus: Take Orrice-roots, half an ounce: Liquorice, an ounce: Sage, Marjoram, of
each one handful: Lavender and Rosemary-flowers, of each a pugil: Raisons
stoned, an ounce: Sena, six drams: Anniseeds, a dram: Carthamus, two drams:
boil, strain, and add Electuary of the juice of Roses, Diaphoenicon, of each a
dram and half: syrup of Roses solutive, an ounce: with Cinnamon water, make a
thin Electuary.

13. He had also this Sneezing to cleanse his Brain: Take Pellitory, a scruple:
Marjoram, half a dram: make a Powder: Snuff it.

14. When all was well, at his departure I advised this Electuary for every
other day: Take Conserve of Marjoram, Stoechas, of each an ounce and half:
Betony-flowers, half an ounce: Roses, an ounce: Rosemary, six drams: Citrons
candied, and Ginger, of each half an ounce: Rosata Novella, Pleiresarchonticon,
of each half a dram: Cinnamon, two drams: with syrup of Betony, make an
Electuary.

15. And this to Purge sometimes: Take Catholicon, one ounce: Diaphoenicon,
Electuary of juice of Roses, of each half an ounce: Pulp of Tamarinds, six
drams: syrup of Roses solutive, with the Infusion of Rubarb, an ounce and half:
Diagrydium, a scruple.

16. I ordered him a good Diet and Exercise, and that he should go every week
into a Hot-house, taking first Syrup of Elder to Sweat, and to wash his Head
with this Lie: Take Orrice roots, an ounce and half: Cypress, Agarick, of each
half an ounce: Marjoram, Sage, Lavender, of each an handful: Rosemary-flowers,
a pugil: Gith-seed, two drams: Coriander, three drams: Clove-gilliflower-roots,
an ounce: Angelica and Asaron-roots, each two drams: make a Lie. Platerus, Lib.
2. Page 363.

XXXIII. An Apoplexy degenerating in a Palsy, with an invincible drowsiness and
heaviness.

1. A certain Person of a Phlegmatic sanguine Temperament, having been very
much employed at a Banqueting business, began even while at Dinner to Stammer;
immediately the Apoplexy seized him, which degenerated into a Palsy of the
right-side, he was also attended with an invincible Somnulency.

2. I came to him on the second day of the Disease, whom I found in this heavy
and sleepy Posture, his Face looked well, and he understood most things, yet his
right Side only was unmovable and paralytical.

3. From the premised Prognostic the Disease is difficult to be cured.

4. Presently, I ordered the following Clyster: Take Roots of Angelica,
Zedoary, of each one ounce: the leaves of Rue, Centory the less, Origanum,
Time, Betony, of Herb Mercury, of each one handful: the flowers of Elder,
Centory the less, all the Cordial-flowers, of each half a pugil: Cummin, and
Anniseeds, of each half an ounce: Bay Berries, half an ounce: the leaves of
choice Sena, one ounce: make a Decoction in ten ounces of the straining
dissolve Diaphoenicon, Diacatholicon, of each one ounce: Benedictum Laxativum,
half an ounce: Oil of Camomil, of Dill, of Orrice, of each one ounce: Sal Gem,
one dram: make a Clyster.

5. Inwardly, he took at turns one spoonful of this Apoplectick Water: Take
Water of Swallows, the Apoplectick Water of Langius, of each one ounce: the
Water of Peony, of Lilly-convally, of each half an ounce: the Oil of Amber,
seven drops: mix them diligently in a glass.

6. Afterward the Crown of the Head and the whole forepart of the Head with
the Nape, was anointed first with the Oil of Amber; then bathed with the
following Water: Take the Water of Sage, Rosemary and Lavender, of each one
ounce and half: Aqua Vitae, one ounce: the Oil of Sage, of Amber distilled, of
each half a scruple: mix them in a glass.

7. After fomentation with this Water, these parts were anointed with the
following Oils: Take the Oil of Earthworms, of Bays, of each half an ounce: the
Oil of Costus and of Nard, of each three drams: the Oil of Foxes, Bears-grease,
of each one dram: the Oil of Rosmary, Lavender, of each half a scruple: mix
them in a Galley-pot.

8. The next day when he Relapses into his Sleepiness, a sharper Clyster than
the former is to be injected, adding the Species of Hiera, two drams:
Diacolocynthidos tied up in a little ragg, two scruples; but this did not stir
up any thing, although it abided half an hour, at length it purged twice or
thrice about the space of an hour after the Injection of the abovesaid Clyster.

9. After twelve of the Clock these things were exhibited for his Drowsiness:
Take the Roots of Angelica, Master-wort, Zedoary, Tormentil, Dittany, the
leaves of Savory (which is a peculiar Medicine against this sleepy Disease) two
handfuls: Lavender, Rue, Time, Marjoram, of each half a handful: boil them in a
sufficient quantity of Wine and Vinegar of the same for a Decoction: take a
double Cloth, which dip in this Liquor, and apply it warm to the Forehead and
Nape of the Neck; let it be often repeated.

10. The juice of Rue mixed with the sharpest Vinegar, should be thrown up into
the Nostrils by a Sponge.

11. Inwardly, there should be put into the Mouth somewhat of the following
mixture: Take Oxymel of Squils, half an ounce: choice Mithridate, two drams:
Castoreum pulverised, one scruple: make a mixture with the Confection of
Anacardiums.

12. With the abovementioned Water going before, and the following Oil a
little stronger, the Spina Dorsi and Nape of the Neck were warmly bathed: Take
Oil of Bays, Oleum Petrolaeum, of each one ounce: Oil of Castoreum, Oil of
Bricks, of each two drams: Euphorbium pulverized, one scruple: a little red Wax
and Vinegar; mix them and make an Ointment.

13. A Sternutatory Powder was likewise put up into the Nostrils; Gargarisms
were tried: Lastly, That no Medicines should be omitted in this so great and
almost desperate Disease ( Clysters and Suppositories, having done little or no
good) we prescribed the following Capital Pills for Revulsion and minoration of
this Apoplectick Repletion.

14. Take Extract. Pil. Cochiae, one scruple: Cambogia, five grains: choice
Castoreum, four grains: Oil of Amber, three drops: a sufficient quantity of the
syrup of Stoechas; make five Pills which are to be gilded.

15. And because they could not be Swallowed, I ordered them to be dissolved
thus: Take Peony and Sage-Waters, of each ten drams: dissolve therein the
aforesaid Pills; to which add Cinnamon water and Trefoil, of each one dram: the
spirit of Vitriol, three drops: mix them; and take thereof a little.

16. About an hour thereafter he did void at diverse times hard, black, and
stinking matter; for greater Revulsion Vesicatories were applied to both sides
of the Nape, but all these means were in vain: Johannes Petrus Lotichius, Lib.
2. Cap. 1: Observe. 10.

XXXIV. An Apoplexy in an elderly Woman.

1. A Woman about the age of forty eight was taken with a strong Apoplexy; she
was of a corpulent habit of Body; she fell down all in a sudden, the more
ancient Physicians had but small hopes of her.

2. At length about sixteen hours after the first assault of the Disease, I was
called being then but a young man, I observed that there was a most grievous
Apoplexy, with a difficulty of Breathing, and a strong and great Pulse.

3. I thought with my self, that a Cure might be tried; therefore I ordered
Blood that same day to be twice or thrice taken away, and that very
plentifully, once in the Arm, afterward in the Foot.

4. Two sharp Clysters were given on the same day, afterward every day one;
some Topics were also exhibited: These things did so well that on the eighth
or ninth day she began to know her Domestic Servants, and to speak a little
Stammeringly.

5. Afterward, purging Medicines were exhibited by the Mouth, then
Apophlegmatisms, and such like things were used, by which she grew somewhat
better; yet she could not be brought to such a degree of Recovery, as wholly to
exercise her Sense and Reason, and to use her Feet.

6. The remainder of the days she lived, she continued impotent; she sat and
was carried in a Chair, and after this manner she lived for some years.
Rembertus Dodoneus, Cap. 8. Observe. Medicinal.

XXXV. An Apoplexy.

1. Phlebotomy will not be inconvenient, provided it be used in the Spring; and
that too great a quantity of blood be not taken away, nor too frequently; for
that which may be a means to prevent the Distemper, may prove a Cause, when
done to an excess.

2. The belly being made soluble and a Vein breathed, if it be convenient; the
Decoction of Sarsa in the Spring will be of excellent use to keep from the
Apoplexy, for it both cleanses and carries off the matter, and loosens any
obstructions that are in the Bowels, it strengthens the inward parts,
especially the Brain.

3. The Decoction is thus to be prepared: Take Sarsa cut into small pieces, two
ounces: the flowers of Prim-roses, and of Lilly-convally, of each one handful:
Fennel-seeds, six drams: Water, four pound: let them be digested twenty four
hours, then boil them to the consumption of a third part, at the end of the
Decoction through in of the Wood of Aloes, three scruples and half: being
strained keep them in a glass bottle for use.

4. I would give every Morning of this Decoction five or six ounces; one dram
and half of Cinnamon Water, being added; that the body being well covered may
Sweat, without wasting of the strength.

5. The Decoction being taken I would purge the body with the Pills of
Alexander, to which I would add somewhat of Aureae and sine quibus, after this
manner: Take Pilulae Nitri, two scruples: Pilulae Aureae and sine quibus, of
each half a scruple: with Primrose Water make seventeen or eighteen Pills.

6. After the use, I would repeat the Decoction for the space of four days,
then I would exhibit Pilulae Alexandri; in Autumn, I would renew the Decoction
without opening of a Vein, and would evacuate the fifth day with Pilulae Aureae
and de nitro.

7. But if he delights more in cleansing Syrups and Decoctions than in Sarsa,
he may do it, for it is not very wide from our intentions.

8. Every month while Winter lasts Pilulae Aloephangina, of Mastich, and of
Aloes Rosata Arnoldi will be profitable, as also the Tragea and the Electuary
and Diacorus may be exhibited by Courses, but I would not have Opopanax mixed
with the Tragea, because it hurts the Nerves and Brain.

9. In Summer Amber prepared with the species of Diarrhodon with sugar
dissolved in black Cherry water, will be convenient, of which Rowls are to be
made, and you may take some of them every other day in the Morning.

10. But if Aqua Vitae be desired, it may be thus made: Take Malago Wine
distilled, two pounds: the leaves of Bawm, the flowers of Lilly convally, of
Rosemary, of Lavender, of Borrage, of Prim-rose, of each one handful: grains of
Paradise, three drams: Cubebs, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, of each two drams: mix them
and set them in the sun in a close Vessel; that nothing may transpire for a
whole month; then press them: he may take of this every month in the new Moon,
or full Moon with a piece of bread, to the quantity of half a dram.

11. In the Morning he may wash his Mouth with the following Gargarism, which
may be thus prepared: Take the roots of Calamus Aromaticus, Nutmegs, Stoechas,
Mace, Marjoram, of each half a dram: boil them in one pound of pure Water,
strain them, then add Vinegar of Roses, half an ounce: Honey of Roses, one ounce
and half: Mustard pulverised, half a scruple: mix them.

12. The chewing of Cubebs in the Morning are profitable, you should abstain
from Masticatories, chiefly Errhines, because they trouble the Brain.

13. I have in esteem for a singular experiment in driving away the Apoplexy,
the use of the following Pills, of which I exhibit half a scruple either the
night of the new Moon or full Moon, in Summer time: but a very slender Supper
is to be eaten before you use them.

14. Take Cubebs, Calamint, Mastich, Nutmeg, Cloves, of each one dram:
Ambergrise, half a dram: Musk, six grains: with juice of Marjoram, make Pills.

15. As to Diet, seeing variety is used, it will be too tedious here to
describe what kind it should be. Scholtzius, Epist. Medic. 8.

XXXVI. An Apoplexy with a Catarrh.

1. A person of Honor was taken with a stupefaction of the Brain, from a cold
intemperature and exorbitant phlegmatic humors his Memory growing every day
weaker and weaker; it came at length to be so far lost, that he could not
remember his own name.

2. After a few weeks, this Gentleman fell into the Apoplexy which ended in a
Palsy of the right-side.

3. I being employed as his Physician, I did so delineate and describe to
another of the same Art, the Constitution of the whole Body and principal
parts, with the Disease and its Symptoms, and the way of Cure, that I purchased
to my self great Applause, which was performed as follows.

4. I advised the same Evening I came to him, to wash his Feet before Sleep
with the Decoction of Camomil, Marjoram, Origanum, Sage and Roses; the middle
Vein was opened and the Superficies of the Blood was covered with a thick and
mucilaginous Phlegm, and from that time, he did no more complain of the Catarrh
which accompanied this Disease.

5. Now to draw away the pituitous humors from the Brain, these following Pills
were exhibited: Extractum Pil. Cochia, Pil. Aureae, Pil. sine quibus, Crollius
his Panchimagog. Extract.

6. Far more special Emundatories of the Brain; first a Masticatory is to be
used, as that of Agarick and Mastich, with Pyrethrum, Nutmegs, Cubebs.

7. A Gargarism was next, of the Decoction of Hysop, Carthamus-seeds, Agarick
with Oxymel.

8. Pills for driving the mucilaginous Matter from the Brain, were of the
natural Balsam, Aloes, Gum Ammoniacum dissolved in Vinegar of Squills, made up
with the Salt of Wormwood and Magistry of Pearl: by the use of which he found
much good. Thonerus, Lib. 2. Observe. 1.

XXXVII. An Apoplexy ending in a Palsy of the right Side with a Convulsion of
the Mouth.

1. A Man of a melancholy disposition, was taken with an Apoplexy, which ended
in a Palsy of the right Side, Arm and Foot, having Sense without Motion;
accompanied with a Convulsion of the Mouth and stammering of the Tongue.

2. The Original of the Nerves residing in the Basis of the Brain were
obstructed and irrigated with phlegmatic humors, which afterward flowing down
from the hinder Cavities of the Brain, by the Vertebrae of the right Side, and
conveying themselves into the substance of the Nerves, deprived the above
mentioned Members of Motion, and intercepts the passage of the animal Spirits.

3. Now for exterminating these wheyish and phlegmatic humors adhering to the
Brain and Nerves, I prescribed Hydromel laxativum.

4. Take Elecampane, Fennel, Cloves, of each two drams: Hysop, Betony, Carduus
Benedictus, Bawm, Rosemary flowers, Sage-Gout-Ivy, of each one pugil: the
leaves of Sena, one ounce: Agarick newly trochiscated, three drams: white Gum
of Turbith, two drams: Hermodactils, one dram and half: Galangal, one dram:
Aniseed, two scruples and half: with a sufficient quantity of Sugar, for two
quarts, make Hydromel.

5. Every other day a quarter of a pint, more or less may be taken, according
to Age and Strength: these following Pills were next prescribed.

6. Take Extractum Pil. Cochiae, one scruple: ex Panchymagoga Crolii, Pil.
Aureae, of each half a scruple: with Sage-Water make fifteen Pills.

7. The Relics of the Matter in the Genus Nervosum may be resolved and
discussed by Sweat: Take Ambros's Decoction, four ounces: generous Wine, two
ounces: mix them.

8. Having taken this Sudorifick every Morning, within 12 days he was perfectly
recovered:

9. The Anhaltine Cephalic Spirit in Broth is good for comforting the Brain,
as also the following things.

10. Take Treacle Water, Aqua Cephalica Mirabilis Langii, of each half an
ounce: Aqua Antepileptica Langii, one ounce: Confectio Alkermes, a dram: or in
place thereof Confectio Diambrae, one dram: mix them.

11. Or, Take the Species Diambrae, one dram: the Juice of Alkermes, one
scruple: the Oil of Amber rectified, four drops: dropped into Sugar, two ounces
and half: dissolve them in black Cherry-Water, mix and make Lozenges or Rowls.
Thonerus, Lib. 2. Observe. 3.

XXXVIII. Preservatives from an approaching Apoplexy.

1. A certain Woman about the age of fifty, being sensible of a cold in the
Brain, in the Winter, and being over and above afflicted with a Catarrh, did
fear a Fit of the Apoplexy.

2. Corroboratives being desired were given her, which are as follows: Take
Conserves of Rosemary-flowers, Bawm, of each six drams: Marjoram, half an
ounce: confected Nutmegs, two drams: Confectio Alkermes, one dram: mix them.

3. Morning and Evening the following are to be used: Take the flowers of
Marjoram, one handful: Rosemary-flowers, Sage, of each half an handful: Arabian
Stoechas, one pugil: Nutmeg, one dram: Cloves, Mastich, of each half a dram:
Styrax Calamitae, wood of Aloes, of each one scruple: with a little Cotton and
Silk make a round Cap: She said she found great good thereof. Thonerus, Lib. 2.
Observe. 6.

XXXIX. Of the Apoplexy, Stupefaction and Palsy of the Tongue.

1. John Vogel one of the Aldermen of Langinga, being eight and forty years
old, having for a long time the Headache, accompanied with a heaviness and
weariness of the Body, was at last suddenly taken with an Apoplexy: For he
suddenly fell down, lay senseless as a Block, without speaking or stirring,
though called upon by his Name, pinched and pricked; he could not hear, nor
perceive, nor answer, nor feel any thing.

2. While he lay in this wretched Condition I was sent for, and calling upon
God for assistance, I understook the Cure of this formidable and acute Disease,
which was managed after this manner.

5. I took of my sneefing Powder the quantity of a Pease, which I blew with a
Quill into either Nostril, at Morning, Noon, and Night, with which he sneezed
very strongly: And his Brain was very well purged, so that in the space of one
day he recovered both Sense and Motion: For he could see and knew the
Bystanders, he could hear them speak; and beckoned by way of answer, but he
could not as yet speak.

4, In the mean while that I used the sneezing Powder, his Sneezings being
over, I put up Oil of Amber with a Feather into his Nostrils, which did
exceedingly comfort his Brain.

5. After I had used these two Remedies aforesaid, I gave him half a spoonful
of the Oil of Lignum Heraclium by degrees, which with the use of other
Remedies, did much advance the Cure.

6. Having now by these three Remedies, (through Gods Blessing) perfectly
recovered his Sense and Motion; so much as that he was able both to eat and
drink, and to walk freely and easily up and down, yet the Palsy and the
looseness of his Tongue continued near upon two days, so that what he could not
utter by Words, he wrote with Chalk upon a Board.

7. In order to restore him to the Motion of his Tongue, I drew plenty of Blood
(for his Veins were very full) out of the Cephalic Veins of both Arms.

8. The day following I purged his Head and whole Body with this Purge: Take
Extract of Esula, one dram: Fountain Water, five ounces: mix, strain, and let
him drink it cold: This wrought to purpose.

9. While I used these things against the Palsy of his Tongue; I ordered once
every hour to smear his Tongue all over with the aforesaid Oil of Lignum
Heraclium, and by these proper Remedies, in the space of a day and a night
beyond all Peoples expectation, he began to speak articulately and distinctly:
and he that was before dumb, began all of a sudden to speak well through the
great Goodness of God. Rulandus. Cent. 2. Observe. 6.

XL. An Apoplexy from Worms.

1. There was a Man who was taken with a malignant Fever, of which being a
very little recovered, suddenly fell into an Apoplexy, by reason whereof he lay
in his Bed as one dead, speaking not a Word, being deprived both of Sense and
Motion.

3. While Cupping-Glasses were preparing for so great a Malady, there appeared
between his Teeth certain Bodies moving one against another, a piece of Wood
being put between his Teeth, and his Mouth opened, three live Worms appear,
which I took out of his Mouth with my Fingers.

2. They being taken forth, the Patient came a little to himself, out of whose
Nostrils a little after two live Worms more came.

4. This Person drinking Juice of Wormwood, with Meal of Lupines, he voided by
stool four dead Worms, and so opening his Eyes he began to know his
Acquaintance that stood by, and being refreshed with proper nourishing
Sustenance, he grew well. Zacutus Lusitanus, Cent. 2. Observe. 35.

XLI. Of the Apoplexy in one going to be buried.

1. Avicen relates how apoplectick Persons have been reckoned for dead and
carried to the Grave, and afterward revived. Avicen 3. 1. Tract. 5. Cap. 12.
which is most strongly debated by the renowned Gregorius Horstius. Lib. 7, de
Med. Histor. mirabil. Cap. 9 Conciliator Diff. 182. Fabritius Hildanus
illustrates the same with inexpugnable Exambles, Cent. 2. Observe. Chyrurg. 95.
and 96.

2. I can also testify with a good Conscience a strange thing, which I saw in a
Fisherman, who being apoplectick twenty hours, cold all over his Body, wrapped in
his Winding Sheet for burial, and laid sewed up on the ground, when the
Bearers, as the manner is, were carrying the Body to the Grave, hearing a
hoarse and strange Cry, they set the Bier down from their Shoulders upon the
ground, and uncovering the Body, saw the Cloth about his Mouth wet and full of
Foam.

3. Whereupon they came with a Cry to me, and two Physicians, who were then
very accidentally passing by, and desired us to give our Opinion, whether the
Man was alive or not.

4. We came, and first felt the Pulfes of his Wrists, and found them beating,
and so using revulsive Remedies with dry Cupping-Glasses and sharp Clysters, he
by littie and little came to himself, and after a few days became a lusty Man
again. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib. 1. Obs. 161.

XLII. Of the Apoplexy continuing three days.

2. The most ancient Hippocrates in the 4th. Aporism of his second Book has
this divine Oracle: Persons strangled and dying, but not quite dead recover
not, if Froath is seen about their Mouths, etc.

2. His most faithful Expositor Galen in his Comment, thus said, Coming forth
of Blood in Persons strangled is a deadly sign, for it argues mighty Heat of
the Heart, a violent Agitation of the Lungs, a squeasing of the substance of
the Lungs, which being mixed with Air and sooty steams, raises a bloody Foam or
Froth, etc.

3. All which sayings are for the most part true, if the contrary happen, it is
exceeding rare and monstrous, Galen Lib. de Foet. Form. Cap. 1. and Lib. 6.
Aphorism. 58.

4. A certain sick Man, eight and fifty years of age, lay in his Bed unmovable
like a dead Carcass: who having been taken with the Apoplexy, fell to the
Ground as if he had been Planet-strucken.

5. This Man laying three days unburied, and being given over by the
Physicians, much bloody Froath appearing about his Mouth, his Friends being
without hope of his recovery, did not endeavor any thing further toward his
Cure.

6. His Wife much against their Wills, sent for me and another Physician, we
came, seeking for his Pulse and found none: But because he was a strong Man,
well set, full-bodied, of a ruddy Countenance, with red Eyes, and had been
accustomed to drink much Wine, we conceived he was fallen into this Disease, by
reason of Blood flowing in and at once obstructing the Ventricles of the Brain,
and intercepting the Passages of the Spirits.

7. Wherefore having foretold the danger of Death, which the Patient was in, we
took Blood sparingly from both his Cephalic Veins, after this Evacvation was
made, the Pulse appeared though very obscurely.

8. We growing a little more confident, let him blood again the next day in the
same Vein, still making use of nourishing Plasters and Clysters, to renew his
Strength: These thing being done, he began both to open his Eyes and know the
Bystanders.

9. The Patient growing stronger by these Remedies, we began to take Courage
and to let him blood again in the wrist, in the branch of the Cepalick Vein:
All which Evacuations being performed, his Speech was restored, his Health
recovered, and he betook himself to his wonted occupation of Writing, yet his
Feet did sometimes totter with weakness as he walked; out we easily cured it by
a strengthening ointment and a Bath of new Wine. Zacutus Lusitanus, Lib. 1.
Observe. 17.

XLIII. An Apoplexy in an old Woman.

1. An old Woman sixty five years of age, after a Vertigo became apoplectick,
the Bystanders would have had the expert Chyrurgion Augustus Megerus to have
opened a Vein, which I (being called, with him) denied.

2. She used the Mixture and the purging Medicines following, and by them was
restored to her Health within few days.

3. The Mixture: Take antiparalytick and prophylactick Water, of each an ounce
and half: Betony-Water, two ounces and half: Syrup of Stoechas, ten drams: mix
them: For the sick to take by spoonfuls: for this Purpose also our Elixir Vitae
is excellent; six or eight drops taken three or four times a day in Wine or
Ale: Or Salt of Mans-skull given to one scruple in Wine, twice a day. So also
the sweet Spirit of Salt given to half a dram in Sage-Wine.

4. The purging Medicines: Take Rosin of Agrick, of the Catholic Extract, of
each eight grains: Salt of Tartar vitriolated, three grains: Oil of Rosemary,
two drops: mix and make four Pills.

5. The Potion: Take blew Fower-de-luce-roots, choice Sena, of each two drams:
lightest Agarick, half a dram: Peony-seeds, one scruple: Betony-Water, a
sufficient quantity: boil, and strain, to two ounces and half of the straining
add Diacarthamum, two drams and half: Oil of Rosemary, one drop: mix and make a
draught.

6. The Powder: Take Salt of Tartar vitriolated, six grains: Salt of Scordium,
one scruple: Resin of Agarick, eight grains: Sugar Candy, half a dram: mix and
make a fine Powder: Let it be done in French or Rhenish-wine. Prax. Barbetti,
Lib. 1 Cap. 2. sub Calce.

7. F. Deckers in his Notes upon this place prefers the Spirit of Sal Armoniack
to be taken in Mother of Time, or Lavender-Water. He says also, let Castor be
added to all Purges in all sleepy Diseases, as the Apoplexy or Lethargy; in its
substance to one scruple; yea Trallius gave two scruples thereof with one
scruple of Scammony.

8. Deckers further says: Being assured by Experience, I commend to all People
the Resin of Colocynthis, as also the Extract of black Hellebor, with Castoreum
in Powder mixed with Sage, Lavender, or Rosemary-Water, or any other Cephalic
Water; for it purges excellently well, and does excite, cut, and draw out
Phlegm, from the most inward and hidden Parts of the Body; to which may be added
for a Spur Tartar vitriolate, which is very powerful in cutting.

XLIV. An Apoplexy cured in an ancient Woman.

1. A certain Woman of about two and fifty years of age, by a great Grief of
Mind, rising early, suddenly fell with a great shriking, with a resolution of
the Sphincter Muscle of the Fundament and Bladder, with a snoring, a full
Pulse, yet sometimes beating swifter, looking upon the Bystanders with her
Mouth awry, and immovable, with the loss of Motion of all Parts, but not of
Sense, for being pricked she drew back a little the Parts.

2. Her Mouth being opened with Wood, In the first place I commanded that one
or two spoonfuls of the following Mixture should be put in: Take Sage-Water,
Lavender, and Antepileptick Water, of each one ounce: Tincture of Castor, half
a dram: Spirit of Sal Armoniack, one scruple: Oil of Amber, eight drops: Syrup
of french Lavender, an ounce: mix them.

3. The Nape of the Neck, Temples, and Nostils were anointed with the Liniment
commended in the 8th Section; secondly the following Clyster was ordered to be
boiled and injected as soon as might be.

4. Take the Herbs Rue, Centory the less, wild Marjoram, Sage, of each one
handful: the roots of round Birthwort, black Hellebor, of each three drams:
Sow-Bread, two drams: the seeds of Carthamus and Agarick tied up in a Bag, two
drams: the inward part of Colocynthis, half a dram: boil them according to Art
in a sufficient quantity of fair Water, take seven ounces of the Colature and
dissolve in it Hiera Picra, with Agarick, of each one ounce: Salt of Rue, one
dram: Castor, one scruple: Honey made with Rosemary-flowers, an ounce: mix them
and make a Clyster.

5. Some tie in a Bag Crocus Metallorum to-together with cephalic and purging
Medicines, which they bid should be boiled together, and such Clysters are most
of all commend by Authors,

6. Within an hour after the Clyster was injected, there came from her by stool
much tough Phlegm with the excrements; in the mean time, we almost always used
the Mixture aforesaid.

7. The second day, as also the following days we put the root of Masterwort
bruised upon her Grinding-Teeth, by which much clammy tough Matter was drawn
forth.

8. The third day we prescribed the following Purge: Take the Extract of black
Hellebor, sixteen grains: Resin of Colocynthis, three grains: Spirit of
Sal-Armoniack, six drops: Castor in Powder, and Tartar vitriolated, of each
half a scruple: Sage-Water, as much as is sufficient: mix them for a Draught.

9. With this she was very well purged, and speak to us, but with a trembling
Tongue, wherefore we prescribed the best Spirit of Anniseed, mixed with the
Spirit of wild Marjoram, with which she washed her Tongue, and her whole Mouth,
and by the Benefit of which she voided much tough Matter, and by degrees the
trembling of her Tongue vanished.

10. But there remains after this Disease an imminution both of Sense and
Motion, to wit, a Numbness, as also a Trembling, but not the Palsy.

11. For corroborating of all Parts and for the perfect restoring of Sense and
Motion; we prescribed the following physical Wine: Take roots of Angelica, of
Florentine-Orrice, round Birthwort, of each three drams: the leaves of Sage,
Origanum, Marjoram, Penny royal, of each one handful; Sena cleansed, an ounce:
flowers of Lavender, St. John's Wort, of each half an handful: white Agarick,
three drams: Juniper Berries, an ounce: Cubebs, Cardamoms, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, of
each a dram and half: Salt of Tartar, one dram: the Ingredients being cut, and
grossly bruised, let them be sown in a Bag, upon which pour four ounces of
Rhenish or french Wine: Of this she took two ounces, with ten drops of the
Spirit of Sal Armonniack three times a day, with which by the blessing of God,
she was cured.

12. I have seen two made apop^ectical, whilst they were taking of Tobacco, in
the which almost the same Medicines were used, as also diverse Errhines,
because they could scarce be awakened.

13. In both also blood-letting was celebrated because their Pulse could
hardly, or not at all be perceived: from which we concluded that the blood
circulated and moved little or not at all.

14. After blood-letting, the Pulse waxed stronger and stronger, and both now
yet troubled with the Palsy, in all those Parts which are beneath the Head.
Deckers upon Barbett, Lib. 1. Cap. 2.

XLV. An Apoplexy from a Bruise, in one being drunk.

1. A certain Person being drunk, fell and bruised the hinder part of the Head,
yet the Skull remained whole, upon which he was taken with a very fierce and
strong Apoplexy.

2. The first thing I used in order to cure, was a very sharp Clyster, which
with a sharp Suppository afterward given did cause a notable Evacuation.

3. His Head being shaved, a Cataplasm of Pigeons-Dung, Euphorbium, Pyrethrum,
and Mustard were applied, from hence many and great Blysters were raised, which
being cut open, a great quantity of a yellowish kind of water did issue forth,
the leaves of red Coleworts being applied.

4. The day after I gave of the species Hieraand of Colocynthis, of each two
drams: Castoreum, half a dram: Rue, one scruple: with the antapoplectick Water,
this Potion being successful, I then applied Cupping-Glasses with Scarification
to the Shoulders, by which, the the Snorting being much abated, and the Froth
about the Mouth altogether dried up, there was good hopes of doing well.

5. The Blysters in the Head ceasing to run, I did raise new ones in the Nape;
at length by these Remedies taken and continued this Person was happily
delivered from this unspeakable Malady.

6. Another Person by the Fall of a great piece of Timper upon his Head, fell
it to this Disease, who was thus cured; I did apply after Universals to his
Head shaved, the Emplastrum Alexandri Benedicti, which Valeriola commends in
his Lib. 5. Observe. 9. which I have found to be a sure Medicine, I shall here
describe it.

7. Take the Gum of Ivy, of Wax, of Turpentine, of each three ounces: fine
Rosin, half an ounce: the Juice of Ivy-berries, four ounces: Ammoniacum, two
ounces: the Oil of Roses, two ounces and half: with a sufficient quantity of
Bean-Flower, make a Searcloth. Henricus ab Heers, Lib. 1. Observe. 21.

XLVI. An Aqua Vitae good against the Apoplexy.

1. I shall here add the Descrpition of that Aqua Vitae, which is good against
the Apoplexy, Palsy, Epilepsy, and other cold Diseases of the Head, together
with the Confection, which the electoral Princes Palatine were wont to use.

2. Take the flowers of Lilly-Convally, eight handfuls: generous Wine, four
pounds: after four or five days infusion in a Vessel of Glass and daily
agitation, let them be distilled in Balneo Maris; afterward take the flowers
of Arabian Stoechas, one handful: the flowers of Lavender, one handful and
half: the flowers of Rosemary, one handful: Cloves, Nutmegs, of each two drams
and half: Cubebs, two drams: Misleto of the Oak, three drams and half: the
roots of Peony, half an ounce: the roots of white Ditany, three drams and half:
split the roots and cut the rest, and let the aforesaid distilled Water be
affused upon them, which is again to be put into the glass for the space of
seven days in the Sun, and to be often shaken or agitated, then let them be
distilled in Balneo Maris: This Water is to be carefully kept.

3. Take the following Tablets: Take the seeds of Peony hull'd, half an ounce:
Pearl, one scruple: Mace, half a dram: leaves of Gold, number seven: fine Sugar
dissolved in the abovementioned Water, five ounces: make Rowls or Tablets.
Reinerus Solenander, Cons. 14. Sect. 3.

XLVII. For an Apoplexy.

1. Shave the Head in that part where the coronal Suture is, then apply thereto
an Emplaster of Mustard, Castoreum, and strong Vinegar, ^y the Arms and Legs
hard with bands, rub the Hands and Feet with Sal Niter, and under the Tongue
put Castoreum.

1. Afterward the Saphena Vein of both Feet is to be opened, then a Vein in
the Hand, or the Nose, or the Jugular; a day after a Clyster was repeated.

3. Take Castoreum, and Euphorbium, of each one scruple: lay it to the root of
the Tongue, it draws away a great plenty of Phlegm by the Pallat in the space of
an hour. Johannes Heurnius ad Hypocrat. Aphor. 42. Sect. 2.

XLVIII. An Apoplexy.

1. A Physician should above all things consider, when his Patient is
apoplectick, whether there be any signs of Life, which if he can discern, he
should then apply himself to the cure.

2. He should order that his Members be often rubbed, his Hair shaven, and the
Crown of the Head and Nape to be anointed with the Oil of Amber, and if his
Mouth be shut, that it be opened and kept so.

3. Let him apply often to his Head hot plates of Iron, and also exhibit one
spoonful of this antapoplectick Water of my composition, which will be found
very good both for preservation from, and cure of this Disease.

4. Take the flowers of Lilly-Convally gathered in the Month of May, about the
rising of the Sun, which while they are ripe and dewy put them into a Glass
without washing (only the flowers must be used) and then digest them in
Malago-Wine, or any other pleasant generous Wine, before the Sun in a
Glass-Vessel well stopped, but you may omit so long, till the Lavender has its
flower, whose flowers separate from the stalks, etc. in equal quantity are to
be put the flowers of Lilly-Convally in the same Glass, to be close stoped up
even to the Month of September following; at length by an Alembeck in Balneo
distill them, and that which first comes forth will be a spirituous Water, to be
carefully kept: For it is precious and of great worth and efficacy in this
Disease.

5. The rest of the distilled Water is for use, but has not so much virtue as
the first, you may make use of it in the Frictions of the Members; this Water
will last long and is most fragrant.

6. You may let blood if there be too much, but a sharp Clyster should be first
injected.

7. You may use for vomits Aqua Benedicta, but here ^t must be noted, that it
is to be always exhibited in a double quantity; if Strength be not wanting: In
the Interim the exhibition of the apoplectick Water is to be continued.
Johannes Hartmanus, Prax. Chimiatr. Page 75. and 80.

XLIX. The Cure of the Apoplexy and Palsy.

1. A Merchant about the age of sixty, of a melancholic Temper by reason of
some considerable Misfortunes happening to him in the conduct of his Affairs,
just as he dined he fell (I being present) without Speech and Pulse, and
without any sensible Respiration, without Motion or Sense, being at once
deprived of the exercise of all Faculties and Powers both of Mind and Body.

2. To me he seemed as one dead, I gave him the Salt of Vitriol in common
Water, for I use always to carry about with me my Antimony and that Salt of
Vitriol.

3. After I had given him this Potion, he immediately vomited up what he had
eaten, with a great quantity of vitrous Phlegm.

4. I also distilled into his Ears the Essences of Cloves and Time, together
with the distilled Oil of Cinnamon mixed with the former, as also into his
Nostrils.

5. And the Hair of his Head being shaved off, I applied both to his Head and
Neck Vesicatories made of Cantharides; and I did affix to his Shoulders Cupping
Glasses with Flame and deep Scarification.

6. At length he opened his Eyes, after he lay in that miserable condition
twenty four hours, he also moved and breathed.

7. In the mean season I gave Aqua Imperialis, three ounces: with the Extract
of Treacle, two drams: and the Oil of Cinnamon, half a dram: and the Oil of
Vitriol impregnated with the Tincture of Gold, half a scruple: These being all
mixed, I gave them him in one Potion, which he swallowed without any
inconveniency, although he was at that time paralytick.

8. The next day, because he could not yet speak, he made signs that he was
grievously afflicted with Pain in the Head, I gave him of my Antimony twenty
five grains in choice wine, by which Medicine he did vomit much for a whole
day, he did also evacuate both above and below, and the next day he began to
speak obscurely and stameringly; yet he could not move his Arms, Feet, nor the
Trunk of his Body unless with a slow and scarcely discernable Motion.

9. The Things above mentioned were again repeated, as also that which was
infused both into his Ears and Nostrils; with things cordial, which he likewise
took.

10. The next day I exhibited to him again Sal Vitrioli, by which he again
vomited much vitrous and viscous Phlegm; the day following I gave him of my
Antimony; by which he was copiously purged both upwards and downwards.

11. At length he speak distinctly but the Motion of his Members appeared very
weak and slow; his Testicles being also swelled, I ordered to dip a linen
Cloth into the Spirit of wine, and to apply it to the greived Part.

12. But yet the Tumor ceased not, but grew greater and harder without any
Inflammation; then we applied a mollifying Cataplasm of the Roots of Althaea and
Lillies, with the leaves of Mallows, boiled in pure Wine and malaxed with the
Bean-meal: first anointing those parts with the rectifyed Oil of Wax.

13. This Remedy being continued for eight days the Tumor of the Testicles came
to a Suppuration, and being opened much filthy matter came forth; and within a
month we healed the Sore.

14. The sick was purged twice in that month with our Antimony, and his whole
Body was anointed with the Spirit or Oil of Wax, and the Oil of Cloves.

15. And that he might Recover again the heat of the Members, and that the
serous humors which the Nerves had imbibed might trouble him no more; we
applied a dry Stupha; every Morning for a whole month.

16. Our Sudorifick Antimony was given him to cause him to Sweat; at length by
the foregoing Medicines, we delivered our Patient both from the Apoplexy and
Palsy; and a thin and light Diet being o^served still by him, he yet lives in
perfect health. Petrus Johannes Faber, Cur. 40.

L. An Apoplexy in a young Girl.

1. A Girl ten years of Age, after bathing of her self, fell into an Apoplexy;
which proceeded from a flux of gross humors into the Vessels, and parts of the
Head, wherein consists the feeling and moving of the whole Body.

2. She snorted much in her Sleep, and trembled all over her Body: I cured her
with Oleum Cranij humani, giving it with Spirit of Vitriol in Lavender-water.
Paracelsus.

LI. An Apoplexy in an elderly Man.

1. One Caspar Mayr; a Carpenter in the City of Lauginga, being about fifty
years of Age, was taken with a strong Apoplexy, of which (through the help of
God) I cured him.

2. Being called to him, I exhibited the following Sternutatory: Take Meal of
Darnel, powder of Nigella-seeds, powder of white Hellebor, of each a scruple:
Marjoram, Rosemary, Sage, of each half a dram: Musk, two grains: make all into
a subtle Powder.

3. Of this Powder about the quantity of three pease was blown up into his
Nostrils with a Quill, by which he sneezed strongly.

4. After the Sneezing I gave Oleum Heraclinum, to about half a spoonful, to be
swallowed by little and little; by virtue of which (almost miraculously) he
presently came to himself, began to speak, and know the Bystanders.

5. Being asked concerning his Disease, how he was taken; he answered, he knew
not how he was affected, nor that he was deprived of all Sense and Motion:
however being now fully come to himself, he called to mind, that before he was
taken with this Disease, he was afflicted with a pain of the Head, and a
streightness of the Breast.

6. And indeed through the mercy of God, he recovered his perfect Health,
beyond the opinion of all men. Martinus Rulandus, Cent. 7. Cur. 44.

SCHOLIA. The THEORY of the APOPLEXY.
By the Author W. Salmon.
LII. The Pathology of the Apoplexy, and first of the Notation thereof.

1. The Names. It is called in Greek (...), a percutiendo; in Latin Apoplexia,
and in English the Apoplexy; a word denoting percussion, wherein after a
wonderful and admirable manner, the sick is struck dumb and senseless.

2. The Definition. Est omnium corporis partium motus ac sensus repentina
privatio, omniumque animalium functionum interceptio. Joel. It is defined by
Riolanus to be an abolition of Sense and Motion with Respiration hurt, which at
last brings snorting and suffocation, by reason of thick phlegm flowing out of
the Funnel and obstructing the Larynx or Windpipe, which does oftentimes and
unexpectedly invade a Man (or follow some other sleepy Disease,) all the
Ventricles of the Brain, but especially the fourth being obstructed, wherein,
unless the matter be discussed in the Spinal Marrow, Death unavoidably follows.
Anot. lib. 4. cap. 2. Fernelius says, That an Apoplexy is a Disease bred by an
obstruction of the Rete Mirabile, the afflux of arterial Blood out of the Heart
into the Brain, being thereby intercepted. Willis says, Apoplexia vi vocis
percussionem denotat, and propter stupendam affectus naturam quasi aliquid
(...) continentem, Sideratio appellatur; namque ea correpti tanquam (...), aut
numine invisibili perculsi, subito ad terram concidunt, atque sensu and motu
privati, totaque functione animali (nisi quod respirant) cessante, quasi
exanimes aliquandiu jacent, and quandoque mortem obeunt; sin reviviscunt,
saepenumero paralysi universali, aut hemiplegia afficiuntur. The Sense of the
word Apoplexy, denotes percussion, and by reason of the stupendous quality of
the Distemper, containing as it were something supernatural it is called a
Sideration, or Blasting; for those struck therewith, being as it were
Planet-struck, or struck with an invisible power, fall suddenly on the ground,
and being deprived both of Sense and Motion, and the whole Animal Function
ceasing, (save that they breath) they lie for a long season, as if Dead, and
sometimes dye indeed; but if they revive, they are many times taken either with
an universal Palsy, or else with a Palsy of one side. Riverius says, It is a
most deep sleep, and a total privation of Sense and Motion, breathing excepted,
wherein the Sick neither opens his Eyes, answers, nor feels when he is hurt,
breathing also with difficulty. Apoplexia morbus est gravissimus, qui primo
caput obsidet, and protinus ac subito sensu and motu, universum corpus private,
ita ut exitus spiritus animalis a cerebro prohibeatur, and vitalis aditus a
cord ad cerebrum praepediatur: a percutiendo nomen habet; quod, qui ea
laborent, veluti de coelo percussi videantur. Avicenna apoplexiam definit, quod
sit otiositas sensus and motus per interceptionem spiritus sensitivi and motivi
ab oppilatione ventriculorum cerebri. The Apoplexy is a Disease suddenly
depriving the whole Body of Sense and Motion, and causing all the Animal
Functions to cease, (breathing only excepted) wherein the Sick lies for a
season, as if Dead.

3. The Kinds or Diferences. 1. The Apoplexy is either accidental, coming of a
sudden, and falling indifferently upon any Man, though not at all predisposed
thereto, for which no preventive method can be instituted: Or, it is habitual,
from a constant disposition in some Men, because of which they are at first
only exercised with light approaches thereof, or rather Symptoms; afterward
the Paroxysms are evident but gentle; but at length they become more grievous,
and of which at last they for the most part dye. 2. The Apoplexy is
distinguished according to its degrees, as Sennertus teaches, Lib. 1. Par. 2.
Cap. 23. into gentle, strong, and strongest: The gentle is that in which the
Sick breaths freely, and easily becomes sensible again. The strong Apoplexy, is
that wherein the Sick breaths with very great difficulty, and as it were with
violence, snorting and foaming at Mouth. The strongest and most dangerous is
that in which all Sense and Motion immediately cease through the whole Body,
the breath also being stopped; in these there is neither snorting nor foaming,
but the Sick lies as if perfectly Dead; and they ought not to be buried before
three days be over, for it has been found, that in that space of time, some so
seized have revived again. 3. The Apoplexy is also twofold, according to the
place; the one is seated in the middle of the Brain; the other in the
Cerebellum. 4. It is either from causes conjunct and procatartick: or from
causes evident, as some external violence.

LIII. The signs of an Apoplexy.

1. The person, before Swoons, sometimes falls suddenly, and sometimes by
degrees; Sense, Motion, and Voice being many times taken away; sometimes only
diminished, respiration alone, and that with much difficulty remaining.

2. The Sick sleeps deeply, and as it were snorts or snores; the loosned
Members being lifted up, fall down with their own weight in the manner of dead
Persons; and their Eyes are either wide open, or shut.

3. The Pulse in the mean season is strong and full (which has deceived many in
the Prognostics of this Disease,) and there is many times a relaxation of the
Sphincter Muscle of the Anus, and Bladder.

4. An approaching Apoplexy is seldom accompanied with any praevious signs;
save in some persons a Lethargy or Vertigo has sometimes gone before, for which
cause they are called the Fore-r^nners of this Disease; as also Dimness of
Sight, the Incubus, Tremor, of the whole Body, gnashing of the Teeth in sleep,
and heaviness of the whole Body.

5. Moreover they are often times seized with this Disease in taking of
Tobacco, which thing has been many times observed by several Authors.

6. This Disease is distinguished from a Carus, for they who have a Carus have
their Senses remaining, neither is the invasion of the Disease so sudden.

7. It differs from a Lethargy, because it is without a Fever and stirring;
and from the Suffocation of the Mother, or Hysteric Passion, and Swooning
fits, because it is observed with a laxity of the Members, a fullness of the
Pulse, and a countenance keeping its color; and without a cold Sweat, which in
a Syncope, is always observed to be cold and clammy.

8. But in this Disease the Sick, for the most part, suddenly falls, all the
Senses and M^tion, as also the Voice being in a moment taken away, the
breathing only (as aforesaid) and that with difficulty remaining.

9. The Sick seems to be in a deep sleep, and many times (as it were) Dead, for
that the respiration is so weak, as not to be discerned, and they lie without
stiring or moving any Member, neither speaking, hearing, seeing, nor feeling,
although pulled, thrust, or pricked.

10. They gape for the most part with their Mouths, their Eyes closed (but
sometimes wide open) and they keep the color of their Face; all the Members of
their Body being lax, and pliable, not stiff, or contracted.

11. Sometimes they foam or froth at Mouth, and many times there comes forth a
bloody kind of froth or Spittle; and sometimes clear blood it self, as I once
observed.

12. From these Symptoms appearing in the Sick it is, that some Authors have
defined the Apoplexy to be a stupidity, joined with a resolution of the parts;
for that being as it were astonished, they lie stupid like stocks, all the
Senses alike, and motion also being abolished together.

13. But these accidents are sometimes more mild, at other times more grievous,
in which both the internal and external Senses are taken away together, whence
they understand nothing, nor have any perceivance of any thing, or show any
sign of Sense though you prick or burn them.

LIVE. The various causes of an Apoplexy.

1. One of the chief causes of an Apoplexy assigned by Authors, is Blood out of
its Vessels, stopping and compressing the Ventricles of the Brain, and that
falls out either from the Rupture of a Vein in the brain, or an over fullness
of the Vessels, or some great bruise or confusion of the Head, or from some
cut, or punctured Wound, by which the Veins of the Brain are hurt or broken,
and so let forth their blood.

2. Barbet says, It is caused from a thick Lympha, for the most part,
obstructing the Nerves; and Deckers says, Not only from the thicker Lympha,
but tough phlegm, or matter contained in the Brain, and obstructing the parts,
by reason of a fall from on high, or by concussion, or a blow, as Fabritius
Hildanus observes, Cent. 6. Observe. 11. Or by sadness, and sudden consternation
of the mind, as the same person proves it: Or, from blood obstructing, a
suppression of some accustomed Hoemorrhage by the Nose or Fundament going
before, as the said Hildanus, Cent. 4. Observe. 11. relates: Or from Blood
extravasated, chiefly from a Wound of the Brain it self.

3. The Seat of the Apoplexy is without doubt within the more inward recess of
the Brain, to wit, the Corpus Callosum; and the proximate and immediate subject
of the Disease is the Animal Spirit inhabiting therein, for that the
Understanding, Imagination, and common Sense, are so deeply affected as to be
perfectly darkened, and to suffer a total Eclipse: But the mediate subject of
this disaffection is thought to be the middle part of the Brain, because from
thence the instincts of all spontaneous motions proceed; and in this, the
perceptions of all sensible things are terminated.

4. For upon the approach of the Paroxysm all the acts of every spontaneous and
intelligible Function (which depend upon the Brain it self) are forthwith
hindered and cease; for that the Animal Spirits being suppressed in their chief
place of meeting, which is the Callous body; their next immediate motion of
expansion in the same place, as also their afflux into the nervous Appendix is
wholly obliterated, whence comes that sudden and universal darkness or total
Eclipse in the whole Animal Region, which is subject to its disposition.

5. However in the mean season the Pulse and Breathing, as also the motions of
the Ventricle and Intestines are in some measure performed, viz. either freely,
or faultily and with pain, because their actions proceed wholly from the
Cerebellum, which is not at all, or but little hurt by the morbifick matter.
Now if the disaffection be so great, as that all the Senses be abolished,
whence motion also does cease: yet the other Functions (which are not so much
the Offspring of the Brain) may remain, as the Pulse, which is excited by the
Heart; and the breathing, which is (partly from a natural and partly from a
voluntary act) excited from the Organs of both kinds of motion, to wit, both of
the Midriff and Lungs.

6. And therefore it is, that though the Brain is extremely affected, so as all
voluntary motion does cease, the Midriff or Muscles of the Breast, contributing
then nothing to the motion; yet then the Breathing is managed or performed by
the natural or spontaneous motion of the Lungs, wherein after a sort they
contract and dilate themselves; but this act of breathing is then with
difficulty, for that it is performed but with one half of its Organs. And
therefore if the disaffection or hurt of the Brain does not speedily pass off
(because the Lungs are not able long to perform the whole duty of Breathing)
Suffocation will infallibly succeed, for that the faculty in both kinds will be
wholly abolished.

7. Now after what manner the Animal Spirits are so suddenly, and all at once
suppressed, or, as it were extinguished, about their original of Emanation, so
that all sense and motion depending on them ceases every where, remains to be
enquired into: Some place the cause in the Heart, and lay the fault on its
Intemperance; others in the Brain, either from its evil Conformation, or from
Obstruction thereof in the greater Ventricles: Or, Obstruction in its Pores, or
lesser passages which being strongly bound up, is said to excite the fit;
because, either the afflux of blood for the generating of Spirits is hindered
from those parts; Or the efflux and Emanation of the said Spirits from thence
to their destinated parts is kept back.

8. From Histories, or Anatomical Observations of Persons dying of this
Disease, Blood has been found extravasated, or out of its Vessels here and
there in great Clodders, compressing the substance of the Brain: In others the
serous Colluvies have overflowed the whole Head, both within and without the
Skull: In others a large Bladder of Water has been found in one of the
Ventricles compressing the smaller passages: From which observations it may be
concluded, that the principal places solely affected, are not the greater
Ventricles, but the middle marrowy substance of the Brain and Cerebel, which is
every where porous, and endued with very many minute passages, both that the
Vital Spirits may flow in thither from the blood, and that the Animal may flow
forth.

9. And though some may suppose, that the Apoplexy, may be caused from the
hinderance of the bloods afflux to the brain; it is true this may be possible,
but, it does not often nor easily happen: for they must suppose it to be either
from the obstruction of the inner Carotid Arteries, and of the Vertebrals,
which happens in the greater Vessels, chiefly about the assent of the Brain,
from concreted or clodded blood; or in the lesser Vessels, which pass through
the Brain from a viscous matter generated within them: but this way it cannot
well be, because those Cephalic Arteries, to wit, the Carotides and
Vertebrals, do so communicate one with another, and all of them in several
places, are so mutually ingrafted one into another, that if it happen that many
of them should be stopped or pressed together at once, yet the blood being sent
to the Head, though by the passage of one only Artery, either the Carotide, or
the Vertebral, it would presently pass through all those parts both exterior
and interior; which thing learned Willis proved an experiment of by spuirting
in Ink into the Trunk of one Vessel, which immediately filled all the
sanguiferous passages, and every where stained the Brain it self.

10. Or the said afflux of Blood to the Brain, may be supposed to be stopped from
the compression of those Vessels, by reason of the tuberosity or swelling up of
the Paristhmia, or Kernels in the hinder part of the Neck; from a heap of
serous or watery humors, that by pressing together the Arteries passing
through, obstructs the passage of the blood to the Head; but the former reason
remains good against this, unless all the said Arteries both Carotid and
Vertebral be comprest together, which very seldom or rarely happens.

11. Or they suppose the said afflux of Blood may he hindered from a
preternatural opening of the Blood Vessels within the Skull, wherein a great
quantity of Blood is poured forth, which should other ways be converted to the
use and benefit of the Brain: this is possible sometimes to be: But certainly
this Cause of an Apoplexy is more likely to arise from the too great Incursion
and extravasation of the Blood within the Brain, as the before mentioned
anatomical Observations at 8. do demonstrate, for that the said Blood so
extravasated, for the most part concretes into a hard substance, which being
large and compressing the Marrow of the Brain, stop up the Passages, and
obstruct the efflux of the animal Spirits.

12. Thus much in general of this Disease: We shall now consider it under its
several Branches, wherein as we say, it is either accidental or habitual, so
must different Causes be assigned to each. If it be accidental it is for the
most part excited without any proevious Disposition, from a sudden and solitary
Cause, being for the most part mortal, the curatory Method proving very often
ineffectual. And of this the proximate or conjunct Cause is, either a great
solution of Unity, happening somwhere within or nere the middle of the Brain,
from the compression or obstruion of its Pores and Passages, whereby the whole
emanation of the Spirits is suppressed: Or else it is a very great and sudden
profligation of the Spirits, or an extinction of those inhabiting the Brain.

13. This Solution of Unity is either, 1. from Blood extravasated within the
Brain, and growing there into Clodders, or striking upon the affected places:
from whence does often arise deadly apoplectick Paroxysms, as several
anotomical Observations upon Bodies, dying of this Disease, have already
demonstrated: but these morbifick Extravasations of Blood within the Brain,
come either from external Violence, as a Fall from a high Place, or from a
Horse, a blow on the Head, or hitting it against some hard thing, and such
like: Or, from an internal Disposition, the blood being thin and sharp, and
growing more then ordinarily hot, either of its own Acord, or by Accident, it
flows forth through the little Mouths of the Vessels, and so easily breaks into
the soft and yiedling substance of the Brain; where being in great quantity
extravasated, by intumifying the affected Places, and compressing the
underlying Marrow (the root of the Disease being at the said Corpus Callosum)
apoplectick Fits, are presently excited.

14. Or 2. from the breaking of an Apostem or Ulcer; which although they are
rarely to be found within the Brain, yet often in the Menings, and almost from
the same Cause, by which the extravasation of the blood happens. This whilst it
is coming on to Maturation, causes only a dull headache or heaviness; but when
once broken, the putrified Matter, falling upon the Cortex of the Brain,
corrodes and putrifies it, and instilling by Degrees its putrid Particles (most
obnoxious to the Spirits) into the Meditullium, or marrowy part of the Brain,
excites at length the Paroxysm.

15. Or 3. from a heap of serous or watery Matter sent forth from the blood
into the Head, filling and stuffing all its medullary pores, by which a
deprivation of Sense and Motion follows; And this has many times been caused
from Drunkenness, and sometimes from unseasonable and immeasurable drinking of
cold Water, or drinking of cold and small Beer being hot and thirsty, and then
sleeping upon it; as also from a long and total suppression of Urine; or
frequent Hoemorrhages suddenly stopped, whereby a translation of the serous
Recrements, are forthwith made to the Brain, by which for the most part a
deadly Apoplexy is caused.

16. The other cause of a sudden and accidental Apoplexy arises from the
immediate profligation or extinction of the Spirits, which may be caused by
blasting with Lightning, or the Fumes of Sulphur, Arsenick, Aqua Fortis, Spirit
of Niter, or Charcole; and not very seldom from strong Narcoticks, or
stupifying Medicines causing Sleep; as also from the too immoderate drinking of
strong Waters; by the too liberal taking of the last of which, we have known
three several persons suddenly taken with apoplectick Fits, who dyed in the
height of the Paroxysm.

17. But how Opiates affect in this Case Webferus tells us, That they do only
too much open and dilate the Pores and passages of the Brain, and as it were
open the doors of it, before fast shut, whereby every extraneous or foreign
and incongruous thing is admitted into the Repository, or sleeping place of the
Spirits, together with the subtle liquor poured forth from the blood; and so by
a violent incursion, dissipates their ranks and orders. This opinion of
Webferus may have something of truth in it, if it be considred in respect to the
first Dose, being too large (for Opiates always hurt most at the first time of
taking) but not to the subsequent Doses; for if so, it would follow, that being
often given they would still bring a greater evil, by dilating more and more
the Pores of the Brain, and thereby make a much easier entrance for all manner
of Impurities: which experience daily convinces us of the contrary; for
afterward being often taken they do little hurt; and the Sick having been a
while accustomed to the use of them, will take in large quantities without the
least Detriment.

18. By this it appears that Opiates do not so much alter the conformation of
the Brain, as immediately to profligate the Animal Spirits, unless given at
first in too large a proportion; for then, by reason of their present
incongruity to them, and sudden falling foul upon them, the Particles of the
Opiate extinguishes the said Spirit, as with a mear Blast: Whereas had it been
given at first in a smaller Dose and gradually increased, till a familiarity
had been begotten between them, the Opiate would have been so far from hurting
or disturbing the Spirits, that on the contrary, it would become infinitely
grateful and friendly to the same.

19. The cause of an habitual Apoplexy now comes to be considered. The
Proeguminine conjunct, or proximate cause, is a malignant matter heaped up, and
dispersed in the compass of the Brain, which at length descending into its
middle or marrowy part, does assault and suppress all the Spirits in the very
fountain of their production and emanation: Now this possibly may be done
either by filling the medullary Pores; or by obstructing and driving away the
Spirits themselves; or by contaminating them with a Stupor or Numbness, as it
were by a blast, (not much unlike lightning) from the malignant contact of the
matter rushing upon them: or by all these ways together.

20. For without doubt, the Particles descending on every side from the compass
of the Brain, into its middle part, or Callous Body, and entering it from every
part, do presently fill the passages how straight soever they be, and putting to
flight the Spirits, force them into a narrow place, where being then beset, and
not able either long to resist, or find out other passages, they are
profligated, thereby obliterating every Function of the intelligent Soul.

21. Being thus profligated, or struck down, they do not suddenly rise up
again, for that they are not able to rid themselves from the chains or umbrage
of the malignant matter; but they lie long suppressed, till at length sometimes
that matter is dissipated, or drawn up into the blood; or, issuing forth
through the little Pores of the Marrow, slides forwards into the Ventricles of
the brain: Or, at length falling down yet lower, it is impacted on the Corpora
striata, either one or both of them, and so causes either a Hemiplogia, or an
universal Palsy.

22. In the inter^m, as the Animal Spirits within the Corpus Call^sum begins to
free themselves, so they resume their accustomed offices, which they manage
again, till new matter springs up in the compass of the Brain, and by degrees
is increased, so as to descend into the Callous Body, as aforesaid, thereby
exciting another Parox^sm; from the embraces of which, if the Spirit cannot
free it self, by either of the aforesaid ways, in some reasonable time, being
by degrees wholly overcome, they are at length perfectly extinguished.

23. As to the Procatartick Causes of an habitual Apoplexy, they are to be
explicated not in a much differing Method from the like in most other Cephalic
Diseases; for seeing that the Blood must necessarily be in fault, for that it
sends to the Head foreign and very hetrogeneous Particles, obnoxious to the
constitution and texture of the Animal Spirits; and that the Brain also is in
fault, for that it has been by degrees weakened and indisposed by the means of
the sanguinous disaffection, whereby its Pores and passages are altered, made
dissolute and too lax, it then follows, that it may at length easily admit
without any difficulty the morbifick and malign matter sent forth from the
blood.

24. How the Blood comes to be thus affected, seems not here necessary to be
declared, seeing we have already done it in many other places; and that it is
obnoxious to and follows all the irregularities of humane life, as profound
Drunkenness with Wine and strong Waters; a long suppression of the Serum from
its usual and long accustomed Evacuations; a translation of the morbick matter
of another Disease to the Head; excessive drinking of cold and small Liquors,
when one is extreme hot and dry; Gluttony and Gormandizing, with many other
like Enormities, too tedious here to be related.

25. For the blood indeed transfers to the Head and Brain (more especially in
Apoplectick persons) a great quantity of saline and noxious juice, or of a
malign serous, and excrementitious humor, extreme prejudicial and for the most
part deadly to the animal Powers, taken sometimes from one place, and sometimes
from another, which by degrees instills them with the Lymphatick and Nervous
juice out of the Arteries on the compass or outer borders of the Brain; where,
by little and little insinuatng the said malign and morbid matter, it overflows
at once all the said outward parts of the Brain, and like a Sea breaking in, or
a Sulphurous or arsenical blast, either drives away the inhabiting Spirits, or
totally extinguishes them.

26. Hitherto we have discoursed of the causes of an Apoplexy in the Brain, it
now remains that we show the causes of that proper to the Cerebellum. In this
case the motion of the Heart is often suppressed or proscribed, whereby
presently (the blood being retained without the Brain) the Animal Spirits
destinated to the vital function fall down, even as the light vanishes when the
flame is put out, and are suppressed, (sometimes extinguished) in the fountain
it self, to wit, within the Cerebellum: whence comes besides a failing of the
Spirits, a sudden privation of all the Animal Functions, the Sick becoming
senseless and immovable, with a Pulse and Breathing very much diminished, and
almost imperceptible, and growing cold, lie as for Dead many hours, yea
sometimes for a day or two, at what time they often times come to themselves
again, though without doubt many dye, being thus taken.

27. These if they recover out of the fit, whether it be of short or long
continuance, do never fall into a Palsy or Hemiplegia, as those for the most
part do, who are afflicted with an Apoplexy of the Brain: and the reason is,
because that proper to the Cerebel proceeding either from a poisonous Gas or
subtle vapor assaulting the Animal Spirits and suppressing them, or from a
vast diminution of them, by reason of a total exclusion of the blood from the
Brain, leaves no substantial morbifick matter to fall down upon the Spinal
Marrow, and obstruct the Nerves thereof, as the other kind of Apoplexy does,
which proceeds from, and is caused by the afflux of humors heaped up in the
Ventricles of the Brain, and other hetrogene substances offending even the
substance of the Brain it self, and its more inward Marrow: but the said
Disease passing off, as the said malign or poisonous Gas vanishes, so by reason
of the retribution of new and fresh Spirits, the Sick remains afterward in
perfect health, though with a paleness of countenance.

28. Now the motion of the Heart may be thought to be hindered, by reason of a
contraction or Convulsion of the Cardiack Nerves chiefly within the Praecordia
and Viscera, caused as aforesaid by some venomous Gas or Vapor, whereby the
Spirits about to flow are suspended, whence follows immediately great
inordinations, with a deprivation of Motion and Sense, and a very slow and weak
Pulse, which causes the sick to lie (for the time) as if Dead. And indeed those
taken with an Apoplexy from the evil disposition of the Cerebellum, are often
troubled with the Incubus, or with Swooning and failing of the Spirits, and an
intermitting Pulse.

29. As to the Cause of the degrees of the Apoplexy, as being either universal,
every function natural spontaneous, and voluntary ceasing; or particular, this
or that part being affected by it self; or the faculties (though they all
without exception suffer an E^lipse) depraved more or less, now this, now that;
it arises from the quantity and quality of the morbifick matter, descending to
the middle or marrowy part of the Brain; as also from its disposition and
location, possessing sometimes all its whole substance; and sometimes but part
of it, as the fore, middle, or hinder parts thereof, etc.

LV. The Prognostics of the Apoplexy.

1. This Disease is for the most part mortal, always doubtful, and never
without present or successive danger, for that the Spirits themselves are the
immediate obj^cts of its malignity or violence.

2. That is most dangerous of all, in which, besides the abolition of all the
spontaneous Functions, the Pulse and Breathing are also defficient, or are
performed with great labor and difficulty; and this for the most part happens
with a cold clammy Sweat, Snorting, and a Foam at Mouth, all which indicate
immediately Death.

3. In an apoplectick Fit, if help follows the use of proper and fit means, a
recovery is to be hoped for; but if on the contrary, the Distemper continues
without intermission, above the space of four and twenty hours, the Case is
very desperate.

4. If after the first Aphonick Paroxysm, the sick becomes more stupid, numb,
or dull, or is frequently troubled with a Scotomia or Vertigo, it is to be
feared, that more Fits will follow: for then it is certain, that the Disease
proceeds from the morbifick Matter already heaped up in the Compass of the
Brain and there dispersedly flowing, descends through the small Pores only into
the marrowy Part; which malign and poisonous or neurotick matter increasing to
a fullness, hastens on a fresh Paroxysm.

5. A strong Apoplexy (says Hippocrates Sect. 2. Aph. 42. is impossible to be
cured, and a weak one not very easily: this Galen, thus explains: A strong
Apoplexy is when the breathing is uneven and disorderly, and sometimes
intermitting; and if such a breathing is very hard or difficult, the Disease is
stronger; if the breath be stopped it is most strong; but when there is some
order (that is regularity and easiness) in the breathing, the Disease is the
weaker.

6. A faint Sweat in an Apoplexy is evil, for it shows great oppression of
Nature; and it is so much the worse if it be cold and clammy, and with great
difficulty of breathing.

7. Hippocrates Sect. 6. Aph. 51. says, that those who are taken with an
Apoplexy dye in seven days, except a Fever seize them: but it must be a
violent one, and essentially springing from the inflammation of the Humors and
Spirits, otherwise it will not discuss the Matter which causes the Apoplexy:
For otherwise if it be only symptomical and gentle, or happning accidentally
from a burning disposition in the Head through too much Blood in the Veins
thereof, the Fever then causes Symptoms of Frenzy or Madness, which weakens
the animal Faculties, rather than weakens the Disease.

8. Moreover a Fever which will have power enough to dissolve an Apoplexy,
must come in the beginning of the Disease, whilst Nature has some kind of
Vigor and Strength to make resistance: for as Hippocrates in Coacis says, if
a Fever come upon an Apoplexy, after it has continued long, it is deadly.

9. An Apoplexy of the Brain going off, often degenerates either into a Palsy
of the whole Body, or into a Hemiplegia; for that the morbifick Matter is not
discussed otherwise than upon the spinal Nerves.

10 If the Paroxysm is so extreme, as presently to deprive the Patient both of
Pulse and Breathing, so that a little after they grow cold, and seem dead; yet
they are not presently to be laid out and given over without hope, under three
or four da^, because such do sometimes revive again, either of their own accord,
or by the use of means. In such it is certain, that the vital heat in the Heart
was not totally extinquished, but like fire raked up in Ashes, it revives
again, the morbifick Matter being dissipated, or evaporated from the Cerebellum.

11. An Apoplexy happening in Youth, and in Summer time, demonstrates the great
Vehemence of the Cause, and such an one, says Hippocrates, Sect. 2. Aph. 34.
is exceeding dangerous.

LVI. The Cure of an Apoplexy in the Fit.

1. The sick being in the Fit (if it proceeds not from some external vehement
hurt of the Head) whether it proceeds from Blood let out of the Vessels, or a
serous or watery humor, or the breaking of an Apostem in the Brain, or other
invincible Cause, yet ought the Cure to be attempted: in performing of which,
let the sick sit as upright as may be in a Chair for some hours: (for the
Disease being a sleepy Disease, if the sick should be put to bed, it might
incline the more to sleep, which is expressly against the intention of Cure:)
then let the extreme Parts (to wit,) the Hands, Arms, Thighs, Legs, and Feet,
be moderately chased, and as Sennerus advises, be rubbed with Salt and Vinegar.

2. Keep his Mouth open, by putting something beween the Teeth; and instill into
the Mouth the Spirit or Tincture of Castoreum: Or this following Mixture: Take
Spirit of Angelica the greater Composition, two ounces: Powers of Lavender, and
Rosemary, of each an ounce: Tincture of Castoreum, half an ounce: Syrup of
Peony, enough to sweeten them: mix them together, and give the sick half a
spoonful at a time.

3. However Physicians think their duty not well done unless the sick be let
blood, let the Disease proceed from what cause soever: yet with Riverius, he
ought to consider whether blood-letting be a thing fit or not; for as Celsus
says, it either kills or cures; and therefore ought to be well considered of
aforehand; for if Blood offend no way, or if the Strength be quite gone, or the
Patient be very old, blood-letting ought to be wholly pretermitted.

4. You ought to offer violence to all his Senses; his Eyes ought to be placed
against the Sun, or an extreme Light: a great Noise ought to be made in his
Ears: sharp things ought to be put into his Nostils, as Rue, Castoreum,
Vinegar, etc. and vehement biting and hot things into his Mouth: his feeling
ought to be stirred up (besides frictions) with pinching, pulling of the Hair,
Ligature or binding, bending of the Fingers, etc.

5. The Temples may be anointed with distilled Oils, as also the Nape of the
Neck, the spinal Marrow, with this following or the like: Take Oils of Amber,
of Spicknard, of Cast^reum, of each two scruples: Oil of the flowers of
Hypericon, Juice of Rue strained, of each three drams: mix them and anoint
therewith, it is a thing of good use not only in the Apoplexy, but also in the
Epilepsy, Lethargy, Carus, etc. This following is better: Take Powers of
Rosemary, and Lavender, of each two ounces: Powers of Castoreum, and Juniper,
of each one ounce: Powers of Cammomil, and Marjoram, of each half an ounce: mix
them.

6. In the mean Season Sternutatories or Errhines either liquid or solid ought
to be applied to the Nostrils: among the common and simple Errhines, you have
these; the Juyces of Betony, of Marjoram, of red Beets, of Brooklime, of
Watercresses, of blew flower de luce, of wild Cucumbers, etc. distilled Waters
of sweet Marjoram, of Betony, Rue, Sage, Lavender, Brooklime, Watercresses,
Garden-Cresses, Origanum, Celindine, etc. The Spirit of Rosemary, of Lavender,
of Juniper, of Caraways, of Sassafras, of leaves of white Hellebor, of Tobacco,
of Elaterium, of the flowers of Lilly-Convally drawn with the Spirit of Wine,
etc. to which add, as things that excel, Spirits of Urine, of Soot, of Sal
Armoniack, etc. Infusions of Sage, Pennyroyal, Time, Lavender-flowers, roots
of Celandine, of Sow-bread, of blew flower de luce, etc. in Wine, or some of
the aforenamed distilled Water. Pouders made of Rue, Sage, Marjoram, Castoreum,
Orrice-root, Ginger, Galangal, Staphisagria, Nigella, etc.

7. Of simple Sternutatories, these following hold the chiefest place: roots of
white Hellebor, of Pyrethrum, of Crowfoot, of Horseradish, of Sea-radish, of
Aron, of blew flower de luce, of Sow-bread. Leaves of Tobacco. Seeds of
Nigella, of Rocket, of Mustard, of Watercresses. Juyces of Euphorbium, of
Sow-bread, of blew flower de luce; to these add also Ginger, black Pepper,
Cloves, Castorium, Agarick, etc.

8. Errhines and Sternutatories more compounded, may be thus made: Take sweet
Marjoram, Betony, Brooklime, bruise them and express their Juice; take of this
Juice half an ounce: Castoreum in subtle Powder, a scruple: mix them: dip
Cotton therein and put it up the Nostrils. Or thus: Take leaves of red Beets,
an handful and half: Mustard Seed, a dram and half: cut and bruise them, and
affuse thereon sweet Marjoram Water, White, Wine, of each an ounce and half:
digest an hour in warm Sand, then press forth the Liquor for use. Another
Errhine: Take Time, Rosemary, Sage, of each half an handful: Spanish-Tobacco, a
dram: roots of blew flower de luce, a dram and half: cut, bruise, and infuse in
Lavender-Water, three ounces: digest in warm Sand for a Night, the next Morning
express the Liquor for use.

9. This following is particularly commended against the Apoplexy, Epilepsy,
hysteric Fits, and other chronick Diseases of the Head: Take good
Spanish-Tobacco, tops of Lavender, Time, Hypericon, of each half an handful:
flowers of the Tile-Tree, of Lilly-Convally, of each three pugils: roots of
Angelica, and of white Hellebor, of each three drams: Castoreum, a dram and
half: volatile Salt of Amber, four scruples: cut, bruise, and affuse thereon
Spirit of Wine, ten ounces: digest in a Vessel close stopped for three days or
more, then with a very gentle Fire, draw off the Spirit to dryness, with which
mix Spirit of Soot, one dram: digest a little, and keep it for use: Now here is
to be noted that liquid Errhines need not be exhibited in quantity above three
drams or half an ounce at most, at one time; a dram or two may serve at a time
in ordinary Cases.

10. Sternutatories in form of Powder, excellent for this Purpose: Take the
best Spanish Tobacco, sweet Marjoram, Rosemary, Sage, of each half a dram:
roots of white Hellebor, Ginger, of each a scruple: Musk, two grains: make a
subtle Powder to sneeze with. Or thus: Take roots of white Hellebor, and of
Pyrethrum, of each half a scruple: flowers of Lavender, of Rosemary, of
Lilly-Convally, seeds of Nigella, of each two scruples: Castoreum, ten grains:
Ambergrise, three grains: mix and make a subtle Powder for a Sternutatory. But
the most admirable of all is this Errhine of Turbith mineral: Take Turbith
Mineral, a dram: Rosemary-leaves, a dram and half: Liquorice, three drams: mix
and make a subtle Powder, soft like Flower: it is a famous thing, and of
excellent use, but must be used with much caution: it draws away indeed the
morbifick Matter to a Miracle.

11. In the mean Season while these things are doing, it will be reasonable
that a Clyster be prepared (as follows) to be exhibited with all convenient
speed. Riverius commends this: Take Decoctum commune, a pint and half: Hiera
Picra, and Diaphoenicon, of each an ounce: Oils of Rue, and Lillies, of each an
ounce and half: Honey of Roses, two ounces: Salt, a dram: mix and make a
Clyster, to be given immediately. Or this of Deckers: Take Rue, Time, Origanum,
Rosemary, of each on handful: Lavender-flowers, three pugils: roots of
Masterwort, of blew flower de luce, of each two drams: roots of Pyrethrum, and
of Sow-bread, of each three drams: Carthamus seeds tied up in a Rag, one dram:
Pulp of Colocynthis, half an ounce: boil in a sufficient quantity of
Spring Water, strain, and to six ounces thereof add Electuary Diaphoenicon, an
ounce and half: the best Castoreum in Powder, a dram: Sal Armoniack, half a
dram: mix and make a Clyster. Or this of the same Authors: Take Rue, Asarum,
Tobacco, of each an handful and half: tops of the lesser Centory, an handful:
roots of round Birthwort, of blew flower de luce, of each half an ounce: roots
of black Hellebor, of Sow-bread, of each three drams: Bay Berries, Grains of
Paradise, of each two drams: cut, bruise, and boil in a sufficient quantity of
spring Water and Urine, of each alike: strain, and in six ounces thereof
dissolve Troches Alhandal, the best Castoreum, of each a dram and half: Honey
of Roses, half an ounce: Electuary of Hiera Picra with Agarick, one ounce: mix
and make a Clyster.

12. Willis says, That Blood is copiously to be drawn back by a strong
Clyster, in which may be dissolved the Species of Hiera Diacolocynthidos, and a
troubled Infusion of Crocus Metallorum. Sennertus prescribes this: Take
Benedicta laxativa, the Species Hiera Logadii, of each three drams: Hiera
simplex, six drams: Pil. Cochiae, one scruple: Sal Gem, four scruples: Oil of
Rue, two ounces: Honey of Roses or of Rosemary-flowers strained, one ounce: mix
it with a pint of the following Decoction and make a Clyster. The Decoction:
Take roots of Angelica, and Orrice, of each three drams: Rue, Calamint,
Pennyroyal, Hysop, Centory the less, Bay Leaves, of each one handful: flowers
of Arabian Stoechas, of Lavender, of each half an handful: Sena,
Carthamus-seeds, of each half an ounce: Juniper Berries, three drams: white
Agarick, two drams: Pulp of Colocynthis tied up in a Rag, (or in place thereof
for the melancholy humor, black Hellebor) one dram: make a Decoction in a
sufficient quantity of Hydromel for the Clyster aforedescribed.

13. If so be Clysters should be troublesome, and there be none about the sick
that can administer them, you must then put up Suppositories into the Body,
such like as these following, Joel prescribes: Take Honey boiled to a
consistency, half an ounce: Powder of Colocynthis, one scruple: Sal Gem, two
scruples: Euphorbium in Powder, ten grains: mix, and make a Suppository.
Sennertus advises this: Take Species Hiera Logadii or Diacolocynthidos, two
drams: seeds of Caraway, and Rue, of each two scruples: Castoreum, and Sal Gem,
of each one scruple: with Honey boiled to a thickness, a sufficient quantity:
make a Suppository. Riverius prescribes this: Take the Species Hiera Picra
Galeni, two drams: Coloquintida, and Agarick, of each half a dram: Diagridium,
one scruple: Sal Gem, two drams: Honey boiled to a consistency, a sufficient
quantity: mix and make Suppositories.

14. Deckers in his Exercitations prescribes these: Take Honey boiled to a
thickness, to half an ounce: Species Hiera Picra, half a dram: Troches
Alhandal, ten grains: mix and make a Suppository. Or thus: Take Troches
Alhandal, a scruple: the best Castoreum, Sal Armoniack, of each half a dram:
roots of white Hellebor, ten grains: with a sufficient quantity of Honey boiled
to a thickness make two Suppositories, which anoint with Oil of Castoreum. Or
thus: Take Meal or flower, two ounces and half: common Salt, two drams: Aloes,
a dram and half: roots of black Hellebor, a dram: Species Hiera Picra Galeni,
half a dram: Pulp of Colocynthis, one scruple: Hermodactils, fifteen grains:
with the yolk of one Egg, and a sufficient quantity of Honey boiled to a
thickness, make the ingredients (being all in fine powder) into a mass for
Suppositories. These Suppositories may also be put up after a Clyster
exhibited, if it comes not away in due time.

15. Moreover, as to Clysters and Suppositories, this is to be observed, that
they ought to be twice as sharp, as in those Diseases that are not
soporiferous; they may then do much good, because they stir up, and draw forth
much pituitous matter stagnating, or fixed in a part, from which the Apoplexy
many times derives its Essence and Original.

16. Vinegar with Castoreum are good to be applied to the Nose, for that they
have a specific property to stir up from Sleep: also the fumes of Vinegar from
a red hot Iron may be received up the Nostrils: and it will be better, if you
put therein Nigella or Pepper-wort seeds, Rue-seeds, or Castoreum: But Vinegar
it self warmed and applied to the Nose, if it be sharp stirs up the Patient
powerfully; and more powerfully, if you add to it Pepper and Castoreum: The
Fumes of Sulphur are very prevalent in this case; as also the Fumes or Smoke of
white Amber, or of Goats-hair, or Hartshorn, which are thought to be specificks
for reviving the Sick out of the Paroxysm.

17. Inwardly, you may put into the Mouth old Venice Treacle, dissolved in Aqua
Coelestis, or Aqua Apoplectica, or Auraea Alexandria, or Confectio Anacardina.
You may also inject into the Mouth a Decoction of Mustard Seed in Vinegar or
strong Wine, or a Decoction of the roots of Pyrethrum in the same with a little
Castoreum: but things which yet more transcend are Powers of Amber, and of
Sea-Cole, spirits of Hartshorn, of Elks hoof, and of Urine, and of Soot, with
other things of like nature: In this case the Volatile Salt of Beans merits
high Commendations.

18. After these things are done, let the Sick be placed in his bed; and if he
be able and does easily Vomit, let an Emetick be given him, of Sal Vitrioli,
Oxymel of squills, or Infusion of Crocus Metallorum; and then with a Feather
put down the Throat, provoke Vomiting four or five times, drinking between
whiles Posset drink. Some do greatly commend Vomits, and chiefly those made of
Antimony, as the Crocus Metallorum, and the Aqua Benedicta made of it; Glass of
Antimony, etc. as also Mercurius Vitae, made of the butter of Antimony.

19. If it so happen that the faculties are so oppressed that Physic will not
work, it is a very evil sign, and such seldom recover: but says Celsus, when
it so falls out; we must use such Medicines as are at hand, if they be proper
for the Disease; and if it be desperate, we may use desperate Medicines; for as
Sennertus says, It is better in desperate Cases, to use desperate Medicines,
than for the Sick without trial, to dye an easy Death. And as the same Celsus
says in another place, Many things may be done in a time of danger and
necessity, which may well be omitted at another time.

20. Therefore when we have used some Medicines without success, we may venture
upon higher and stronger, to wit, such as are made of Antimony, especially
those which are less vehement and furious, as the Aqua Benedicta Rulandi, and
Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, (both before mentioned) which purging both
upwards and downwards, bring such a quantity of Phlegm out of the Mouth, not
only from the Stomach, but from the Brain also, that sometimes the Patient is
cured with this only Evacuation: And Riverius testifies upon his own
experience, that he saw a noble Man thrice in 2 years, cured of an Apoplexy
with this only Medicine.

21. Notwithstanding Hoeferus, in his Hercules Medicus, advises to beware of
Vomits, unless the Patient be taken Apoplectical immediately after Meat, and
the Physician be called at the same time: but says Riverius, although some
learned men do forbid the use of Vomits in these Diseases; yet we must yield to
experience, which daily teaches us, that Children affected with sleeping
Diseases, are more readily and safely cured by the Vomiting Salt of Vitriol,
than with any other Medicine. The same Author commends a Tincture of Tobacco,
drawn with Aqua Vitae, to be taken to the quantity of two drams, to be mixed
with Honey or some Syrup, and so poured down the Throat.

22. Blood-letting, and Cupping-glasses Barbet says, he very rarely approved
of, but Riverius advises, Cupping to the Back, Shoulders, Arms and Thighs
without Scarification, if blood had been formerly taken away; or with
Scarification, if it had not: But says he, The chief and only place, is to
apply Cupping-glasses to the Head, the which is confirmed by an History of
Zacutus Lusitanus, where he says, That he cured a desperate Apoplexy by
setting a Cupping-Glass twice upon the hinder part of the Head with deep
Scarification.

23. If none of these things do, and though the hopes of Life be but small; yet
let the top of the Head be shaven, and a red hot Iron held over to scald it;
or, if you like not that, lay a large Vesicatory over it; (but Riverius advises
to lay the Blistering Plasters to the Neck behind, and to the Shoulders: both
may be good:) then let the other parts of the Head, especially the Temples and
Forehead be bathed with Bezoartick Vinegar; and let a Dose of Spirits of
Hartshorn, of Amber, or of Soot, be often cast down the Throat, which things,
or other like, cease not to administer, till you see Death it self approach;
for th^se Remedies (as Celsus says) not only defer Death, but sometimes revive
again to life.

24. On the next day let the same Remedies be continued, the Clyster repeated,
and the spirit of Sal Armoniack be held to the Nose, or a fume of Galbanum
boiled in Vinegar, or Ens Primum; (being the Fumes of Sulphur condensed in
water:) Moreover let Errhines or Sternutatories, and Masticatories or things to
be chewed in the Mouth be used: then in the Evening let a Purge be ordered of
Pilulae Rudij, or of our Family Pills, or Pilulae Cochiae the less; or a
Solutive Electuary of Roses, dissolved in some convenient Vehicle.

25. But that the Brain and parts weakened may be strengthened, and to
corroborate the Ventricle, and other Viscera, as also to promote the more
liberal generation of Animal Spirits, Apoplectick Waters and Spirits ought to
be given. This of Sennertus is good: Take Lavender-flowers, two handfuls:
flowers of Rosemary, of Betony, of Sage, of each one handful: Cubebs, Grains of
Paradise, Nutmegs, of each half an ounce: rectifyed Spirit of Wine, two pound:
let them stand in digestion, in a Vessel close stopped for some days, then decant
the Tincture: Dose two drams in any convenient liquor. Or this: Take Cubebs,
two ounces: Nutmegs, grains of Paradise, Cardamoms, of each one ounce and half:
Cinnamon, Calamus Aromaticus, Zedoary, of each an ounce: Cloves, six drams:
Species Diamoschu Dulcis, Diambrae, cum moscho and Ambra, of each three drams:
choice Canary or Sherry Wine, a sufficient quantity; let them stand in Infusion
eight days; then distill off the spirit. Again, Take flowers of Lavender,
Rosmary, and Arabian Stoechas, of each four ounces: Indian spicknard, three
ounces: Rue, Gentian Mustard seed, Rocket-seed, of each two ounces: black
Pepper, one ounce: rectified spirit of Wine, six pound: let them stand in
digestion four or six days, then carefully in a double glass Body in Balneo,
draw off the spirit: these two spirits mix together, and infuse therein the
best Castoreum in Powder, two ounces: after twenty days, decant the Tincture
and keep it for use: or if you so please, you may for two or three Months keep
it upon the faeces. Dose one dram to two or three in a fit Vehicle.

LVII. The Cure of an habitual Apoplexy; or the prophylactick or preservative
Method the Patient being out of the Fit.

1. Where an Apoplexy is habitual, although a course somewhat different from the
former must be taken, yet not contradictory to what is already prescribed in
the Fit: For first, there must be (as there) an evacuation of the morbifick
Matter; which is done by a continued course of Purgation, either upwards or
downwards, according as the Seat of the peccant humor lies: by exhibition of
Errhines, Sternutatories, Masticatories, Clysteries: by application of
Vesicatories, Cupping-Glasses, the Seton: and lastly by Bathings, and other
sudorifick means: all which things we have largely explicated in the former
Section, with plenty of examplary Prescripts; so that here we may be the more
brief in the dilating upon those things. In the Fit; the Method of Cure has
relation to the speedy performance thereof, without which it is wholly
ineffectual: Out of the Fit, we put things in practice more leisurely, and in
that order that the urgency if the Symptoms require; it being rather
prophylactick or preventative than curative; wherein after a gradual manner the
habit of the Body is altered; the morbid Matter taken away, sometimes by
insensible means, sometimes by proper evacuations; according to the nature of
the humor offending; and lastly, the vital Intention is prosecuted to the
completing of the desired Cure.

2. Secondly: After the proper Evacuations are made, (yea, and in the time of
making them) such things ought to be exhibited, as may not only alter the
universal habit of the Body, but also strengthen and corroborate the Parts
weakened by the Disease; restore those which are hurt by the procatartick Cause:
and withal open Obstructions so powerfully, as to prevent the renewing of the
morbid Matter; the neglect of which Intention, has been the reason of the
return of the Disease in several persons, who otherwise might have obtained
their perfect Health.

3. In the last place, for the completing of the Work proper Specificks are to
be exhibited M^rning, Noon, and Night, or after, (as need shall require:) that
thereby the Footsteps of the Disease, the morbid habit, and the very
inclination thereto, or any thing like it, may be obliterated in their first
acts or approaches: by this means we not only confirm the Cure, but secure the
future state of the Patient, by fortifying him against all the dangers of a
Relapse.

4. If the Patient be easy to vomit, let him first take a proper Emetick, as
the Emetick Tartar of Mynsicht, the Vinum benedictum, the Aqua benedicta
Rulandi, or Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, with Salt of Vitriol, or the Sulphur
of Antimony, or this following: Take fresh leaves of Asarabacca, from six to
nine: bruise them, and put them into three or four ounces of White Wind, squeez
them forth, and add thereto Wine of Squills, half an ounce: mix them. Or this:
Take Emetick Tartar of Mynsicht, three grains: Crocus Metallorum, four grains:
Salt of Vitriol, ten grains: mix them for a Dose.

5. Three or four days or a week being past, you may p^rge the Patient with our
Family Pills, which in due intervals of time may be repeated three four or six
times more or less, as you see the sick to abound with evil humors. Physicians
say, That Purges in this Disease ought to be strong; and that we ought not to
be too curious or fearful in purging, for that the Disease does much require
it, the humors being many and stubborn, and the Senses so drowned or overcome,
that they cannot be roused or stirred up without strong Medicines.

6. Some prescribe for a Purge the Electuary Diacarthamum one ounce, dissolved
in Betony-Water with ten or fifteen grains of Castoreum. Or this: Take Turbith,
four scruples: Agarick, two drams: Ginger, two scruples: Fennel seeds, one
scruple: Castoreum, six grains: infuse them in a sufficient quantity of
Betony-Water: strain, and in three ounces thereof dissolve Electuarium
Diacarthamum, three drams: Syrup of Roses, an ounce: mix them. Or this: Take
Pil. Cochiae the less, one dram: Castoreum, six grains: with Betony-Water make
seven Pills: if the sick cannot swallow Pills, dissolve them in Sage or
Lavender-Water.

7. Or this: Take Pil. Cochiae the greater, Pil. de Agarico, of each half a
dram: Troches Alhandal, Scammony, Castoreum, of each three grains: with Honey
of Roses make Pills, or dissolve it in Sage-Water. Or this: Take Sena, half an
ounce: white Agarick, a dram and half: Turbith, one dram: Ginger, Galangal, of
each half a dram: boil them in Sage and Rosemary-Water: strain, and in two
ounces and half thereof, dissolve of the Electuary Diacarthamum, two drams:
Oxymel simple, half an ounce: Castoreum, a scruple. Or this: Take Scammony, a
scruple: Troches Alhandal, Castoreum, of each half a scruple: with Syrup of
wild Cucumbers make Pills.

8. But before the adhibition of a Purge you are to consider whether the Belly
be bound or not; for if it be, you must be sure before hand to exhibit a
Clyster, which may be made of the roots of Angelica, of Fennel, of Peony, of
the Bark of Elder, of the leaves of Rue, Sage, Hysop, Origanum, Betony,
Rosemary, Lavender, Marjoram, Calamint, Pennyroyal, of the flowers of Arabian
Stoechas, Lavender, of the berries of Juniper, Bay, Dwarf-Elder, of the seeds
of Peony, Fennel, Anise, Carthamus, of Agarick, Sena, Colocynthis, Electuarium
de Hiera simplex, Diacolocynthidos, Logadii, Pacchii, Diaphoenicon, Benedicta
laxativa, Pil. Cochiae, Mel Anthosatum, Oil of Rue, of Bays, and of Cammomil.

9. Take Pellitory, of the Wall, Hysop, Calamint, Origanum, Rue, Sage, and the
lesser Centory, of each one handful: Carthamus-seeds, half an ounce: Fennel,
and Cumin-seeds, of each three drams; white Agarick tied up in a linen Rage,
two drams: Colocynthis tied up with it, one dram and half: boil them to one
pint, strain, and add to the Liquor Hiera Picra, half an ounce: Diaphoenicon,
one ounce: Oil of Rue, two ounces: mix and make a Clyster: Some add to the
Clyster Aqua Bendicta Rulandi, two ounces: which makes it work strongly.

10. You may give four or six ounces of the same Infusion ( viz. of Crocus
Metallorum) at a time, also you may take it out of the Glass, where the
Infusion is made, presently after shaking, that it may have some small matter
of the Powder in it, to make it the more strong. Therefore for the most part
Clysters of Aqua Benedicta, or Vinum Emeticum are prescribed, because in many
Diseases, especially Cholicks they do Wonders, you may make it after this
manner: Take fat Mutton-Broth, a pint: Tincture of Colocynthis made with Spirit
of Wine, an ounce: Infusion of Crocus Metallorum shaked together, two ounces:
mix and make a Clyster: It Is an admirable one in an Apoplexy.

11. Platerus commends this: Take roots of Orrice, Pyrethrum, of each one
ounce: of Aron, half an ounce: roots of Hellebor, one dram: leaves of Rue,
Sage, Time, tops of Centory, Watercresses, of each one handful:
Carraway-seeds, half an ounce: Nettles, and Rue, of each one dram:
Mustard Seed, two drams: Pulp of Coloquintida tied up in a Rag, half a dram:
Rosemary-flowers, two pugils: make a Decoction: strain and dissolve therein
Hiera Colocynthidos, half an ounce: Honey, an ounce and half: Oil of Rue, three
ounces: Castoreum, Euphorbium, of each a scruple: Sal Gem, one dram: mix and
make a Clyster.

12. Moreover Suppositories, seeing they do greatly irritate, and may quickly
be prepared, and by reason of their weakness who cannot keep Clysters, are very
convenient, and often to be repeated, especially in an Apoplexy and
Apoplectical Constitution; in which also, those things which burn, when as the
Sick are without Sense, can no ways do any hurt.

13. And therefore the gentler being first tried, if they do no good, the
following stronger things may be used. Take Honey, two ounces: juice of
Mercury, half an ounce: Bulls Gall, six drams: Aloes, three drams: boil them to
a thickness; adding toward the end, roots of white Hellebor, of Pyrethrum, of
each half a dram: Colocynthis, half a scruple: Sal Gem, two scruples: mix and
make Suppositories: but if you desire it to be more speedily prepared mix these
Pouders with strained Opopanax and Galbanum, with a little Ox-Gall.

14. In the Progress of the Cure, Purges also ought to be repeated, especially
where the humors are multiplied and thick, or apt to stagnate: and they must be
reiterated again and again, if the Disease or habit yields not to the former,
so as to give the Patient hopes of Recovery: A Tincture of Colocynthis given,
mixed with a quarter of a pint of white Wine is of singular use, if the Patient
can be made to take it, by reason of its bitterness.

15. Orderly Evacuations also may be made from the Brain by proper Errhines,
Sternutatories, Masticatories, and such like; as also by application of
Vesicatories, Seton, Cupping-Glasses, making of Issues, etc. of which we have
given full and ample Directions in the former Section; save, that these things
may be often repeated in an habitual Apoplexy, at fit intervals of time.

16. Let us now come to the alteration of the habit, which is for the most part
performed by the constant taking of a Diet drink, which for this purpose you
may make after this manner. Take mealy Sarsaparilla bruised, three pound:
Raspings of Guajacum, and of Sassafras, of each a pound and half: Calamus
Aromaticus, Burdock-root, of each a pound: Zedoary, Liquorice, of each half a
pound: boil all in six gallons of water, or more to the consumption of two
gallons: then add Juniper Berries bruised, Carraways, of each four ounces:
Coriander-seeds bruised, Mustard Seed, of each two ounces: Raisons stoned, blew
Figs slit, of each a pound and half: boil till about fourteen quarts remain,
which make pleasant with white Sugar, strain, and bottle it up.

17. Of this the Sick may drink a pint or a quart a day, as they see
convenient, and repeat the same quantity two, three, or four times, according
to the urgency of the Discrasy: but here you are to note, That if the Decoction
proves too strong, (as it certainly will for some) you may weaken it by adding
to the whole two, three, or four quarts of pure White or new Rhenish Wine: It
ought to be taken constantly and long, for otherwise the depraved habit of the
Body will not be altered or changed.

18. If you would yet make the Diet more powerful, you may add to the
composition Virginian Snake-root, a pound: Contra yerva, half a pound:
increasing proportionally to the quantity added, the quantity of water: by this
means you will have indeed a most efficacious alterative, which will not fail
in performing of that which is desired.

19. Dr. Willis prescribes this Chocolate. Take powder of the roots of the
Male-peony, Man's Skull prepared, of each half an ounce: the Species Diambrae,
two drams; make a Powder, to which add of the cleansed Kernels of the
Cacoe-Nuts, one pound: Sugar, so much as will suffice: of this make a
Chocolate. Take of it half an ounce or six drams, every Morning, in a draught
of the Decoction of Sage or Rosemary, or Betony, flowers of Peony, or
suchlike: and you may repeat it (if you so please) at night too.

20. He also prescribes for ordinary drink: A Vessel of four gallons to be
filled with ordinary Ale, in which six handfuls of white Horehound dried had
been boiled, with Anacardiums and Cardamums cut and beaten, of each an ounce
and half: to be put into a bag with a stone in it, and so put into the Ale,
during the time it is a drinking. Thus much for altering the habit: It remains
that we prosecute the Vital Indication, by prescribing such things as are
Specificks against this Disease: and then lastly, come to the applications of
Topics, and so conclude.

21. Barbet gives us a Catalogue of these Specificks altogether, which are
these following: roots of Angelica, of Masterwort, of blew Flower-de-luce, of
florentine Orrice, of Galangal, of Pyrethrum; leaves of Lavender, Rosmary,
Hysop, Rue, Spicknard, Ground Pine, Sage, wild Marjoram, and all Vegetables
which are Diuretics or Cephalicks. The flowers of Lavender, Lillies, Oranges,
Spike, Stoechas, Juniper Berries, Cubebs, Cardamoms, Carraways, Mustard Seed,
Nutmegs, Cloves, Cinnamon, Ginger, Pepper, Balsam of Peru, Civit, Musk,
Castoreum, Peruvian Balm tree: Waters of Lillys-Convally, of Juniper, of
Parsley, of Sage: the Anhaltine and Apoplectick waters of Crollius, of Mynsicht,
of Quercetan, and of Riverius: Spirits of black Cherries, of Pismires, of Man's
Skull, of Man's Blood, of Lillys-convally: Essence of Ambergrise, Amber,
Castoreum: the Elixir of Peony, of Mynsicht; syrup of Rosemary-flowers, of
Mint; the Anacardine Confection: Chemical Oils of Amber, of Sage, of Lavender,
of Spicknard, of Cloves, of the Hazle-tree: Conserves of Oranges and
Rosemary-flowers, of Mint: the Apoplectick Balsam, and all Compound Cephalicks:
the Magistery of Man's Skull, of Amber; the Apoplectick Salt of Mynsicht, and
his Troches of Emerald, the Elixir Vitae of Barbets prescription. To these
Deckers adds, Spirit of Sal Armoniack, the stinking Spirit of the Volatile Salt
of Tartar, or the Diaphoretick in very acute Diseases, mixtura simplex, made of
five parts of Spirit of Treacle camphorated; four parts of the spirit of Tartar
rectified, and one part of the spirit or Oil of Vitriol rectified; all mixed
together and digested for some weeks.

22. Take of the Antiparalytick and Antiprophylactick waters of Sylvius, of
each an ounce and half: Betony-water, two ounces and half: syrup of Stoechas,
ten drams: mix them, and let the Patient take it by spoonfuls. Or this: Take
the greater Elixir Vitae of Quercetan, a dram: Powers of Rosemary and Lavender,
of each two scruples: rectified Spirit of Angelica, half a dram: Oil of
Cinnamon, ten drops: mix them. Of this you may give twenty or thirty drops,
three or four times a day in a glass of Wine or Ale. Or, you may give twice a
day, the Salt of Man's skull to one scruple, The spirit of Sal Armoniack is
admirable being taken in Lavender or Mother of Time-water. And the dulcified
Spirit of Salt rightly prepared, being constantly taken to ten or fifteen
drops, yea to half a dram, in Sage or wild Time Ale, or other proper Physical
drink. The Volatile Salt of Amber is commended by all Men as a most experienced
Medicine; and the Volatile Salt of Beans is no ways inferior to it for the
same purpose: you may give them with the addition of ten grains of Castoreum.

23. Platerus commends this Compound water for this Disease. Take Sage,
Rosemary, Time, Marjoram, of each half an ounce: Rue, two drams:
Lavender-flowers, three drams: fr^nch Lavender, one dram: Rocket-seed, one
dram: Cinnamon, half an ounce: Nutmeg, two drams: Cloves, one dram and half:
Cubebs, one dram: infuse them in the most generous Wine, that it may supernate
the space of two inches, and distill in Balneo according to Art. Dose one, two,
or three spoonfuls, Castoreum in fine powder may be infused in the same Water,
which may be afterward strained away, and the water then given: but you need
not infuse it in the whole Composition, as some do, but rather infuse it in the
one half or a third part of the same, keeping the greater part which is most
grateful for constant use.

24. Also if you infuse the abovenamed Herbs, and others of like nature, in the
best rectified Spirit of Wine, digesting them a convenient time in the Sun, or
other gentle heat; and withal repeat the Infusions for several times, you
shall make a strong and most admirable Tincture for this same purpose. Or, if
out of every Herb a part, you draw the like Tincture, they will be each
effectual to the same Intention, also you may make a mixture of several of
them, as you shall see most convenient, which will be as effectual as if you
had drawn the compound Tincture all at once. The Tincture, Spirit, and Powers
of Rosemary, are extolled above all the rest, especially the former, and the
latter being made with the best rectified and Inflamable Spirit of Rosemary.

25. For such a Spirit, by reason of its extreme subtilty and heat with which
it is endued, carries the Virtue of other things to the Brain, and casting
forth much phlegm, it stirs up the native heat and benumbed faculties. For this
reason we judge it a good Menstruum to draw forth and extract the Tinctures of
proper Cephalicks, and Antapoplectick Vegetables, and may be used in this Case,
much more advantageously than Spirit of Wine.

26. Oils extracted by the Art of Chemistry from most of the aforenamed things
at 21. aforegoing, do exert the greatest power, though given but in a drop or
two, and therefore are very beneficial if they be dropped upon a little Sugar,
mixed, and then dissolved in any convenient Vehicle, and so put into the Mouth
to be swallowed. Of this kind are the Oils of Marjoram, of Sage of Rosmary, of
Lavender, of Sassafras, of Limons, of Oranges, of Time, of Hysop, of Mint, of
Southernwood, of Wormwood, of Penny royal, of Featherfew, of Origanum, of
Calamus Aromaticus, of Pepper, of Cloves, of Nutmegs, of Amber, of Cinnamon,
and such other like. Hollerius extols, the Oil of Vitriol, which because of its
sharpness causes Watchings: but the dulcified or sweet Oil is infinitely the
better, being so made by digesting it for a long time with the best rectified
Spirit of Wine, or of Juniper Berries.

27. Willis prescribes this distilled Water: Take the roots of the Male Peony,
of Imperatorian Angelica, of each half a pound: roots of Zedoary, of the lesser
Galangal, of each one ounce: of the leaves of Tree Misleto, of Rue, Sage,
Betony, of each four handfuls: of the outer rind of ten Oranges, and eight
Limons, Cardamoms, Cloves, Nutmegs, of each half an ounce: all being cut and
bruised, pour to them of White Wind, (in which two pints of Peacocks-Dung has
been infused for a day) ten pints: let them be close stopped for three days, then
distill it according to Art, and let the whole Liquor be mixed together.

28. Riverius commends this following Water instar ommium, which, he says, was
invented by himself: Take Peony-roots, and Misleto, of the Oak, of each two
ounces: Calamus Aromaticus, Galangal, Cyprus, of each one ounce: Betony, Sage,
Marjoram, of each one handful: Peony, Angelica, Fennel, and Caraway-seeds, of
each three drams: Lavender, Stoechas, and Rosemary-flowers, of each a pugil:
Nutmegs, Mace, Cloves, Cubebs, Cardamoms, Grains of Paradise, of each half an
ounce: Cinnamon, two ounces? Saffron, one dram and half: the Species Diambrae,
and Diamoschu, of each two drams: cut and beat them, put them into a glass
Still, and affuse thereon a sufficeint quantity of the best Spirit of Wine: let
them stand in a warm Balneo Maris, with Hay in it, for the space of eight days,
then draw off the Water according to Art, which keep in a bottle close stopped
for use.

29. But that we may not ty you up to one or two prescripts (besides what we
have exhibited in Our Pharmacopoeia and Doron Medicum,) we will present you
with several others out of the great Sennertus, Take Nutmegs, Cloves, Mace,
Ginger, Zedoary, Galangal the greater and lesser, Pepper, white, black, and
long, Cinnamon, Calamus Aromaticus, round Cyperus, Doronicum, Grains of
Paradise, Cardamoms, Cubebs, Castoreum, seeds of Carraways, Fennel, Anise,
Citron, Limon, and Orange peels, of each three drams: Spicknard Indian, Celtick

and bruise, and affuse thereon, of the best Rhenish Wine, of the best spirit of
Wine, of each five quarts: let the Vessel be well stopped, and set in the sun for
a month, or some other warm place, or in warm sand, if it be in Winter time,
shaking it twice or thrice every day, then distill off the Water according to
Art.

30. Take Flowers of Lavender, of the Tile-tree, of Peony, of Sage, of
Rosemary, of Lillys-convally, of each one ounce: Misletoe of the Oak gathered
in the decrease of the Moon, half an ounce: Betony, Primrose-leaves, Hysop, of
each a handful: Cubebs, Mace, Nutmegs, of each half an ounce: Rocket-seed, two
drams: affuse thereon a sufficient quantity of spirit of Wine, and distill
according to Art.

31. Aqua alia Apoplectica: Take the lesser Cardamoms, Cubebs, Nutmgs, of each
half an ounce: Wood of Misletoe of the Oak, one ounce: Rue, red Sage, of each
an ounce and half: Lavender-flowers, three ounces: Castoreum freed from skins
and fat, an ounce and half: cut, bruise, and affuse thereon of the best Rhenish
Wine, or water of Lilly-convally distilled with Wine, a sufficient quantity:
digest in a glass close sealed up for fourteen days, then distill in Balneo
according to Art.

32. Aqua alia Apoplectica magis composita: Take Lavender-flowers, two
handfuls: flowers of Rosemary, Spike, Elder, leaves of Rue, Rosemary,
Pennyroyal, Calamint, Spearmint, Origanum, Mother of Time, Betony, Sage,
Marjoram, Bays, of each half an ounce: seeds of Anise, Fennel, Peony, of each
three drams: Rocket-seed, roots of Elecampane, of florentine Orrice, flowers of

each four scruples: Misletoe of the Oak, one ounce: Castoreum, half an ounce:
flowers of Lillys-convally, four handfuls: cut and bruise grossly, and add
thereto Species Diamoschu Dulcis, two drams: Diaprassium, one ounce: Diapoeoni,
half an ounce: all made up into a Nodulus: affuse thereon of the best Rhenish
Wine, nine pounds: of the best spirit of Wine, eight pounds: Sage-water, a
pint: Waters of Lavender, Spicknard, Hysop, of the Tile-tree, of white Lillies,
of each half a pound: Rosemary and Sage water, of each eight ounces: infuse all
together in a glass close stopped in a warm place for fourteen days; then distill
according to Art: the first two quarts, being stronger keep by it self, and the
weaker water by it self, to be used ordinarily.

33. A Powder: Take roots of the Male-Peony, Virginian Snakeroot, Man's skull
prepared, of each an ounce and half: roots of Zedoary, Contrayerva, Angelica,
Winter 's Cinnamon, of each half an ounce: let all be made into a fine powder;
and add thereto of the yellow of Oranges and Limons candied, of each two ounces
and half; let all be beaten again to a powder. Dose from half a dram to a dram,
an hour before and after meals. Or this, commended by Riverius: Take white
Amber, half an ounce: powder of the Electuary Diarrhodon Abbatis, two drams:
Peony-roots, one dram and half: make all into a subtle Powder; Dose a dram in
any convenient Vehicle.

34. Mustard seed given to half a dram is of excellent use, you may give it
condited, or add it to Meats by way of Sauce. Nutmegs are good to be often
chewed in the Mouth, as Riverius affirms. Galen gave some grains of Castoreum
with Oxymel, and Trallianus says, That many, overcome with this Disease, have
been recovered with this only Remedy. To which Platerus says, we may add some
grains of Euphorbium, the Tincture of which in Spirit of Wine may be given. The
juice of Onions may be given with Rue, or Sage-water, or with the Infusion of
Rocket or Mustard seed in Wine. So also the sharp juice of Watercresses given
in like manner a spoonful or more at a time is very profitable. The Anacardine
confection is of admirable use in all cold Diseases of the Brain, but chiefly
in an Apoplexy, and we rather choose to use it than Mithridate or Venice
Treacle, giving it either by it self, or dissolving it in a little
Cinnamon Water. But the Extract of Sage is a great secret, and a specific in
an Apoplexy.

35. An Electuary: Take Conserves of the flowers of Lillys-convally, or of the
male Peony, six ounces: powder of the root of male Peony, half an ounce: Man's
skull prepared, three drams: seeds and flowers of the male Peony poudred, of
each two drams: red Coral prepared, Pearls and the whitest Amber, of each one
dram: salt of Coral, four scruples: syrup of the flowers of the male Peony,
enough to make an Electuary. Dose two or three drams Morning and Evening,
drinking after it two or three ounces of some proper Antapoplectick-water.

36. Platerus commends this Electuary, as very excellent in the Progress of the
Disease: Take Conserve of Orrice-root, the true Acorus, that is, the Calamus
Aromaticus in the shops, of each one ounce: Sage, Rosemary, Marjoram, Stoechas,
Lavender, of each half an ounce: Confectio Anacardina, two drams: the species
Diambrae, Diamoschu, of each half a dram: seeds of Rocket and Rue, of each one
dram: with Oxymel of Squils or Honey of Anacardiums, make an Electuary. Dose
the quantity of a Chestnut every other day: or one dram of it to two, may be
taken Morning and Night, mixing with it eight or ten grains of Castoreum, and a
grain or two of Euphorbium.

37. Sennertus advises to this Electuary: Take Conserves of Lavender flowers,
one ounce: Conserves of Rosemary-flowers, Sage, Marjoram, Betony, of each an
ounce: Calamus Aromaticus condited, half an ounce: Species Diamoschu dulcis,
half a dram: Rocket-seed, a dram: with Honey of Anacardiums and Syrup of
Stoechas simple make an Electuary. This is better, Take Conserves of Sage,
Rosemary, Lavender, Stoechas, Marjoram, of each half an ounce: Calamus
Aromaticus condited, Confectio Anacardina, of each two drams: the Species
Diambrae, Diamoschu, of each half a dram: volatile Salt of Amber, Salt of
Mans-skull, of each a dram: Powder of Virginian snake-root, and of Contrayerva,
of each a dram and half: volatile Sal Armoniack, two scruples: with Syrup of
the Juice of Kermes make an Electuary: Dose from one dram to two.

38. Lozenges: Take Species Diambrae, two drams: Powder of the roots, of Male
Peony, choice Zedoary, of each one dram and half: Pearls, a dram: the best
rectified Oil of Amber, half a dram: the whitest Sugar dissolved in
Peony-Water, six ounces, and boiled up to a consistency: with which make
Lozenges according to Art, each weighing half a dram: Let the Patient eat one
or two, often in a day at pleasure: and after the eating of them, to drink a
dram or two of some proper Apoplectick Water, or the Aqua Vitae Matthioli,

39. Riverius commends these Tablets or Lozenges: Take Ambergrise, half a
scruple: distilled Oils of Aniseeds, of Cinnamon, and of Nutmegs, of each three
drops: Oil of Cloves, one drop: Sugar dissolved in Orange flower-water and
boiled up to a consistence, four ounces: mix and make Lozenges according to
Art, each weighing a dram: Dose one or two Lozenges every Morning; after which
you may drink a little Aqua Apoplectica.

40. Sennertus prepares these Morsels: Take the Species Aromaticum Rosatum, a
dram: Diambrae, two scruples: Diapliris cum Moscho, Dianthos, of each a
scruple: Conserves of Rosemary and Lavender-flowers, of each one dram and half:
Extracts of Peony, five grains: of Galangal, three grains: red Coral dissolved,
a scruple: Oil of Nutmegs by Expression, four grains: Oils of Cloves, and of
Amber, of each two drops: Sugar dissolved in Rosemary and Lilly-Convally
Waters, and boiled up to a consistence, a sufficient quantity: mix and make
Morsels according to Art. Or thus: Take white Amber prepared, two drams and
half: the Species Aromaticum Rosatum, Diambrae, Dianthos, Diapliris, of each
two scruples: Sugar dissolved in Betony-Water and boiled up, eight ounces: mix
and make Morsels.

41. Rotulae Antapoplecticae: Take Extracts of Peony roots, and of Calamus
Aromaticus, of each one scruple: Pearls prepared, two scruples: red Coral
prepared, half a dram: Oil of Nutmegs by expression, one scruple: distilled Oil
of Nutmegs, twelve drops: Oil of Fennel seed, seven drops: Sugar dissolved in
Peony-Water, and boiled up, three ounces: mix and make Rowls according to Art:
after the same manner may Rowls be prepared with chemical Oils of Cubebs, which
will be of great efficacy.

42. These Pills also are given to corroborate and strengthen the Head and
animal Powers, being taken in the Morning fasting, and last at Night going to
bed: Take Cubebs, Mastick, Nutmegs, Cloves, of each one dram: Ambergrise, half
a dram: Musk, half a scruple: with Extract of Gentian make Pills: Dose from a
scruple to half a dram, or two scruples: it is a most excellent composition, and
a Specific in the Case.

43. This following Tincture is inferior to few things: Take Virginian-snake
root, Contrayerva, Bay berries hull'd, Zedoary, Cubebs, Cloves, of each an
ounce: Cinnamon, Anacardimums, of each an ounce and half: with the best
rectified Spirit of Wine (the Ingredients being all well bruised) make a strong
Tincture in forty days shaking of it every day: then let it stando till it is
fine, decant the Tincture, and put intn it pure Ambergrise Musk, of each three
drams in very subtle Powder: upon which let the Liquor perpetually stand: Dose
two or three drams in a Glass of Wine every Morning fasting.

44. We commend also, as Specificks in this Disease the Potestates or Powers of
Rosemary (a most admirable thing) the Powers of Lavender, of Sage, of Tansy, of
sweet Marjoram, of Origanum, of Oranges, of Limons, of Sassafras, of Bay and
Juniper Berries, of Time, of Savory, of Pennyroyal, of Caraways, and of Amber:
than which no other preparations can be more powerful; for that they pierce
into the most remote and inward recesses of the Brain and animal Spirits, and
that powerfully and momentarily. To these you may add the volatile Salts of
Urine, of Mans-Blood, of Sal Armoniack, of Mans-Skull, of Vipers, of Amber, of
Ox-horns, of Hartshorn, of Elks-hoofs, of Tartar, of Soot, and such like,
which by a specific property overcome the Disease: nor is the volatile Salt of
Beans in any thing behind them, the preparation of which we have taught
elsewhere.

45 If the Disease proceeds from Blood thrust forth into the Cavities of the
Brain, (besides provoking Blood by the Veins in the Nostrils, or opening those
under the Tongue, or the Jugulars,) we must use things less hot; and also we
must use Medicines that purge Choler, with those that purge Phlegm. If it comes
in a Melancholy habit of Body, purge Melancholy chiefly with Sena, and if the
Patient be strong, with the Extract of black Hellebor, and alternately with
both of them, as you shall see convenient, and then give the Medicines before
prescribed for strengthening the Brain and comforting the Animal Spirits. If it
proceeds from fullness or too plentiful feeding after a liberal evacuation both
upwards and downwards, you will find that abstinence, at least temperance, will
mightily facilitate the Cure.

46. It now only remains that we show what Topics are to be applied, and so
conclude We have already spoken of the application of Vesicatories, Seton,
making of Issues, etc. we will here add a word or two of Cauteries, for that
Authors have declared from thence such admirable eff^cts: Some in the height of
the Disease burn the hinder part of the Head, between the first and second
Vertebra or Backbone, with an actual Cautery: Some apply them to the Crown of
the Head, others to the hinder parts thereof; others to all those places.

47. Zacutus Lusitanus applied them often in his time with good success; as he
witnesses in his Praxis Admir. Lib. 1. Observe. 14. his words are these. I
being called to visit a sick Man who for the space of thirty days was taken
with a deep and irresistible sleep, concomitant with a small Fever; he had
used many evacuating and diverting or repelling Medicines, but they profited
nothing; therefore applied the Actual Cautery with much benefit: for with a red
hot Iron I soorched the Crown of his Head, till it was hard and crusty, as also
the hinder part, and almost every where about his Head, by which means he
awaked, and the places burned beginning to matter, he arose and came to
himself: by this means I remember I cured two in dead sleeps, contrary to
expectation; after all means had been used in Vain: and those were cured by the
heat of the fire, melting and dissolving the humor, which came forth at their
Mouth and Nostrils many days after.

48. Riverius advises to this: Take Bay and and Juniper Berries, of each an
ounce and half: roots of Zedoary, Angelica, Masterwort, Pyrethrum, of each one
ounce: Betony, Sage, Rosemary, of each an handful: Rue, Sage, Marjoram,
Lavender-flowers, of each half an handful: boil them in Vinegar: In this
Decoction dip a Sponge or linen Cloth, and apply it warm to the Head. It is a
wonderful thing (says he) to see what this will do: but if you add to it a
quarter part or better of Spirit of Wine, it will do yet much more.

49. Sennertus prescibes this Fomentation for the Head being first shaved: Take
roots of Orrice, Ciperus, the true Acorus, of each one ounce: Marjoram, Bays,
Sage, wild Time, Pennyroyal, Savory, Bawm, of each one handful: flowers of
Lavender, Stoechas, Cammomil, of each a pugil: seeds of Agnus Castus, a dram:
boil in Lie, with a little Wine: with this Decoction foment or irritate the
Head. Or thus: Take Oil of Nuts, two pounds: Aqua Vitae, Juice of Rue, of each
an ounce and half: Pennyroyal, wild Time, Sage, of each a handful: cut and
boil them for a Fomentation for the Head.

50. Afterward you may anoint the Head with some proper Antapoplectick Oil or
Balsam: as, Take Castoreum, half an ounce: Ashes of Mans-hair, three dram:
Juice of Rue, Vinegar, Oil Olive, of each two ounces: boil to an Ointment: with
which anoint the Head after Fomentation. Or, Take Oil of Pepperwort, or Oleum
Costinum, Oils of Castoreum, and of Euphorbium, of each an ounce: Powder of
Mustard seeds, and of Euphorbium, of each a dram: Vinegar, a spoonful: Wax
enough to make an Oyntmet. But this following is preferred as the best of
Apoplectick Balsams by Riverius: Take Oil of Nutmegs by expression, half an
ounce: Ambergrise, Musk, Civit, of of each a scruple: Chemical Oils of Spike,
Amber, Cinnamon, Rosemary, Cloves, of each half a scruple: mix them. With this
Balsam touch the Palate every Morning; put some of it into the Ears, and some
up the Nostrils: and for the same purpose the Chemical Oil of Nutmegs used in
the same manner is much commended.

51. This Oil we commend upon our own Experience: Take Oil of Ben, half an
ounce: Chemical Oils of Oranges, Limons, Cloves, Nutmegs, Rosemary, Lavender,
Sassafras; Marjoram, Rhodium and of Amber, of each twelve drops: mix them to
anoint with. Or this: Take Oil of Ben, half an ounce: Chemical Oils of
Rosemary, Lavender, Nutmegs, and Limons, of each twenty six drops: mix them to
anoint with, as before directed, as also the Nape of the Neck, Forehead, and
Temples, which repeat Morning and Night, for some days.

52. But the things which indeed transcend all all others, not only in power
and Virtues, but also in neatness and cleanliness, are the Powers of
Medicaments, which momentarily pierce and penetrate the parts, performing their
operations to a wonder: of these the chief are the Powers of Rosemary,
Sassafras, Oranges, Limons, Lavender, Sage, sweet Marjoram, Origanum, Angelica,
Tansy, Savory, Aniseeds, Carraways, Juniper and Bay Berries, Cloves, Nutmegs,
and Amber. Or this Compound: Take Powers of Rosemary, Savin, and Sassafras, of
each two ounces: Powers of sweet Marjoram, Lavender, Oranges and Limons, of
each an ounce and half: Powers of Nutmegs, of Cloves, and of Juniper, of each
an ounce: Powers of Amber and Aniseeds, of each half an ounce: mix them, to
bath the parts withal Morning, Noon, and Night: if you so please add the
Powers of Musk and Ambergrise.

53. After you have for fourteen, twenty, or thirty days bathed the Head and
other parts with the aforesaid mixture of Powers to strengthen and confirm the
Head and Brain, you may (having first shaved off the Hair) apply this following
Emplaster: Take strained Galbanum, Opopanax, of each an ounce: Myrrh,
Frankincense, Mastich, of each half an ounce: Chemical Oil of Rosemary, and Oil
Olive, of each enough to dissolve the Gums; melt, and add a sufficient quantity
of Wax to bring it to the consistence of an Emplaster: which spread upon
Leather, and apply over the Crown of the Head, extending it over all the
Sutures, even to the Nucha, and renewing it once a week.

CHAP. V. CORONIS OPERAE. Forasmuch as in several of the precedent Cures;
especially of Grulingius, Thonerus, Platerus, Poterius, etc. several
Medicaments and Compositions are mentioned which are not to be found but in
their respective Works, and that, it may be, with trouble too; We thought good
(that this Work might not be lame) to add the same by way of Appendix, as a
Conclusion to this first Volumn of Our Observations.

2. Aqua Vitae Narcotica Plateri. He no where describes it, but tells you it is
excellent against pains of the Joints and Gouts, Tumors of Wind and Defluxions.
Inwardly you may also take a spoonful to ease pain. But as a Succedaneum to it,
he prescribes a Tincture of Opium, with Correctors, as Castor and Camphir.

that Jupiter must be in double proportion) powder them very finely, add and mix
well therewith Sal Niter poudre. in a tripple proportion: calcine them in a
crucible with a gentle Detonation, and keep them in a red hot heat, for some
hours; being cold, wash away the Salt by many affusions of fair warm water,

infusion being given, thus. Take Terra Sancta, one ounce: Wine, half a pound:
let them stand one night in Infusion: Dose from one ounce to two, according to
age and strength.

XXIV. The Virtues and Uses of the Natural Balsamum de Chili.

1. There is lately brought from Chili, a Province in America, a most excellent
Natural Balsam, differing both from that of Peru and Tolu, but no ways
inferior in Virtues and Excellency, as the several Experiments made by several
learned Physicians, in the curing of Diseases, has given evident demonstration.

2. It is a Remedy that no Man under the Sun can Compose, being a Natural
Balsam, Distilling from a small Tree in Chili, bearing a Leaf something
differ-from an Olive-Leaf. It is, without doubt, the most precious of all
Natural Balsams, by reason of its great Virtue, and admirable odor, excelling
all others, even the most fragrant.

3. It eases all manner of Pains in any part of the Body, coming of Cold or
Wind, chiefly, pains of the Stomach, indigestion and want of Appetite,
corroborating and strengthening of it, after a wonderful manner. It cures all
Ulcers of the Breast and Lungs, Reins, Bladder, or Womb, Inward Bruises,
Spitting of Blood and such like. It helps shortness of Breath, Coughs,
Consumptions, Wheasings, Hoarsness Asthma's and other Diseases of both parts.

4. It is excellent against the Falling Sickness, Apoplexy, Convulsions, Palsy,
Lethargy, Tremblings, old Head-achs, Megrims, Vertigo's, and other cold and
moist diseases of the Brain and Nerves, being inwardly taken, as shall be
hereafter directed; and outwardly anointed upon the part. It strengthens the
Brain, comforts the memory, and fortifies all Senses both Int^^nal and
External, beyond any other Natural Balsam.

5. It kills Worms whether in old or young, cures Ruptures, although of many
years standing, and dissolves the Stone and expels it, as also Sand, Gravel, or
Slime, or any other thing which may obstruct the Urine, or stops up its
passages: So that it is believed there is scarcely a better Remedy for that
purpose upon Earth, for it gives ease in the vehementest Pains, and being
constantly taken for a time, perfects the Cure.

6. It eases also all Chollick pains, Gripings, Wind in the Stomach or Bowels,
and perfectly cures all Fluxes, Bloody-Fluxes, Excoriations, and such other
like distempers of the Guts. It cures deafness, pain and noise in the Ears to a
wonder, a drop or two being put into the Orifice of the Ear, and kept in with a
little Cotton dipped in the same.

7. It cures the Green Sickness in Virgins, and provokes the Terms in Women,
being taken from Ten to Twenty, Thirty, or Forty drops in a Glass of
White Wind (as shall be anon directed) Morning and Night for a Week together.
It cures also Barrenness, promotes Conception, and causes easy and speedy
delivery to Women in Travel; and in a great measure prevents or takes away
after-pains, taken to the quantity aforesaid in a Glass or Juniper, or
Cinnamon Water.

8. The way and manner of taking it Inwardly. In Diseases of the Head, Brain
and Nerves, gives it in Rosemary, or Cinnamon Water, or in Canary: For the
Stone and other Diseases of the Reins and Bladder you may give it in
Rhenish-Wine: For the Cholick and diseases of the Bowels you may give it in
Juniper-Water: For Palsies, Gouts, and Weaknesses of the Nerves and Joints you
may give it in some Antiparalytick-Wine. If the Sick cannot take it in any
proper Wine or Water, it may be given mixed with any proper Syrup: If it cannot
be so taken, it may be made up into Pills with some fit Powder, as of Zedoary,
Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Bayberries, Cubebs, or what the Physician shall think more
proper, and so gilded, for by this means it will be taken without nauseating:
you give it from half a dram to two, yea to three drams, acccording to Age and
strength, and it may be given Morning and Night for a Month, two or three
togeth^^ ^^out any prejudice.

9. And (...) ^^^tain that this Balsam is one of the greatest Specincks in the
cure of the Palsy, Scurvy, and Gout, that is, it transcending all other
Medicaments: but it ought to be constantly given, and in a due Dose, and with
those advantages that it may not nauseat the Stomach: So taken it performs more
than any other Natural Balsam, it cleanses the whole Body of all Impurities,
Mundifies the whole Mass of Blood, Heals all inward Bruises, Wounds, Ulcers, or
Excoreations, whether in the Bowels or Lungs; and otherwise restores decayed
Nature to a miracle, carrying off all its Faeculenties by Urine and Stool.

The Merchant that has brought it over, has only entrusted it to be Sold with
Mr. Thomas Passenger at the Three-Bibles on London Bridge; where it may always
be had in any quantity, ready put up in square Glasses, Sealed with the Balsam
Tree, Price 24 s the Pound, or 18 d. the Ounce.

Book I. Contains, 1. Necessary Observations on the Letters of the Alphabet. 2.
Directions how to divide words into Syllables; showing also that some Syllables
of 2 and 3 Letters have not always the same sound, (a great Discouragement to
Learners) which they are, and how to pronounce them right: 3. An Alphabetical
Table of all English words (especially the hardest to spell, or understand)
which also are followed with an Interpreter or Expositor.

Book II. Contains the various Significations and diverse Senses which many of
ours English words have: among which are mixed words often mistaken for others,
also those alike in Sound but unlike in Letters and Sense; with those unlike in
Sense yet alike in Sound and Letters: which without any hindrance to the
English Learner has their Latin words joined to them: for the help of
strangers desirous to learn our Speech, and for the (...) ingenions Youth, when
they begin to learn (...) being exceeding pleasant and delightful: By obse^^^^g
which Rules an ordinary person (as to English Orthography) may find faults in
the more learned, who have not formerly b^^n curious in observing their
Mother Tongue.

Book III. Contains the Authorities of English Orthography: that is the Reasons
why words must be writ with these right, rather than other false Letters, which
truly make the like sound: That this only can be discovered every one must
acknowledge, from knowing their Originals or Primitives; which is here
faithfully and laboriously attempted, whether from the Hebrew, Greek, Caldee,
Arabic, Syrick, Latin, Saxon, Italian, Spanish, Dutch high or low, French,
etc. Designed purely for the Propagating of Learning, that there may not be one
of a Thousand but may read and wright English commendably and comfortably:
which when attained, many will proceed to other Sciences: but being stopped here,
some became brutish, and others worse.
