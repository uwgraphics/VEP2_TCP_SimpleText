WHereas some have given out, that by the Act of Council, which explaineth the
Confession of Faith lately commanded to be sworn by his Majesty, to be
understood of the Confession of faith, as it was then professed and received,
when it was made, and that in that Confession, defense both of the doctrine and
discipline then established is sworn, at which time episcopal government being
(as they say) abolished, it must needs follow, that the same government is by
this late oath abjured.

And understanding that even amongst those who continue together still at
Glasgow, under the name of a general Assembly, though but a pretended and
unlawful one, this objection is held to be of some moment, and used by them to
the great disturbance of the peace of this church and kingdom, and to the
great disquieting of the minds of such his Majesty's good subjects as have
taken the said oath, and yet never meaned nor do mean to abjure episcopal
government; And to persuade others, that if they shall take the same oath thus
explained by the said Act of Council, by so doing they must likewaies abjure
the said government:

We James Marquess of Hamiltoun, his Majesty's high Commissioner, wondering
that any such scrupulous misconstruction should be made of his Majesty's
gracious and pious intentions, and being desirous to remove all doubts from the
minds of his Majesty's good subjects, and to keep them from being poisoned by
such as by forced and forged inferences would make them believe, that they had
actually by taking that oath sworn that which neither virtually nor verily they
have sworn, or ever intended to swear, or was required by authority to be sworn
by them, either directly or indirectly: Considering that all oaths must be
taken according to the mind, intention, and commandment of that authority,
which exacteth the oath; and that we, by special commandment from his sacred
Majesty, commanded the said oath to be administered, we do hereby freely and
ingenuously profess and declare our mind and meaning herein, as we have
constantly heretofore done since our coming into this kingdom about this
employment; viz. That by any such words or act of council we never meaned or
intended that episcopal government should be abiured, nor any thing else which
was established by acts of parliament, or acts of the church of this kingdom,
which are now in force, and were so at the time of the taking of the said oath.

Nor indeed could we have any other intention or meaning, being clearly
warranted and expressly commanded by his Majesty's instructions, to exact the
said oath, and take order that it should be sworn throughout the kingdom in
that fair and lawful sense, and none other. Neither in this point did we
deliver our own words, or his Majesty's mind ambiguously or doubtfully, so as
any other sense, to our thinking, could be picked or wrung out of either the
one or the other; for we do attest the Lords of the Council, whether we did
not to many, or all of them upon several occasions in conference with them
ever since our coming into this kingdom, constantly declare unto them, that his
Majesty's resolution was not to suffer episcopal government to be abolished:
We attest all the Lords of Session, whether before our tendering of that oath
to them, or their Lordships taking of it, we did not fully and freely declare
to them, that his Majesty's mind in commanding us to see this oath taken, and
our own mind in requiring them to take it, was only to settle and secure the
religion and faith professed in this kingdom, but was not to be extended to
the abiuring of episcopal government, or any other thing now in force by the
laws of this church and state at the time of administering this oath, which
their Lordships, being the reverend and learned Judges of the laws, knew well
could not be abiured; after which perspicuous predeclaration of our mind,
their Lordships undoubtedly in that same sense and none other took the said
oath.

And now, good Reader, having heard his Majesty's mind and intention, and in
pursuance of them, the mind of his Majesty's high Commissioner concerning this
oath, though reasons to repel the former objection seem to be needless (the
known mind of the supreme Magistrate who urges an oath, being to be taken for
the undoubted sense of it) yet forasmuch as that objection has of late bin
mainly urged for alienating the minds of many of his Majesty's good subjects,
and well affected to that government, from adhering unto it, be pleased to
know, that the former objection has neither show nor force of reason in it,
and that by the said oath and that explanation set down in the act of council,
episcopal government neither was nor possibly could be abiured, and that for
many reasons, but especially these five, which we having seen and approved,
have caused to be here inserted, and leave them to thine impartial
consideration.

them. But to hold, that until such time as these judicatories shall repeal
the said laws, they either ought to be, or can possibly be abjured, is a
wicked position, and destructive of the very foundation of justice both in
church and commonwealth.

especially considering that this church in her confession holds church
government to be alterable at the will of the church: certainly we repeating
but their oath, cannot be said to abjure that government now, more then they
could be said to do it if they were now alive and repeating the same oath.

to maintain Perth articles, and to maintain episcopacy. Why therefore some men
swearing the same words and syllables should have their words taken to another
sense, and be thought to abjure episcopal government, more then others who
have taken the same oath in the same words, must needs pass the capacity of an
ordinary understanding.

it cannot bedenied, but that oaths ministered unto us must either be refused,
or else taken according to the known mind, professed intention, and express
command of authority urging the same: A proposition, not only received in all
schools, but positively set down by the adherers to the said protestation
totidem verbis in the place above cited. But it is notoriously known even unto
those who subscribed the confession of faith by his Majesty's commandment, that
his Majesty not only in his kingdoms of England and Ireland, is a maintainer
and upholder of episcopal government according to the laws of the said
Churches and Kingdoms, but that likewaies he is a defender, and intends to
continue a defender of the same government in his kingdom of Scotland, both
before the time, and at the time when he urged this oath, as is evident by that
which is in my Lord Commissioner his preface, both concerning his Majesty's
instructions to his Grace, and his Graces expressing his Majesty's mind, both
to the Lords of Council, and to the Lords of Session; and the same likewaies
is plainly expressed and acknowledged by the adherers to the said protestation
in the place above cited: their words being these; And it is most manifest that
his Majesty's mind, intention, and commandment, is no other but that the
confession be sworn, for the maintenance of religion as it is already or
presently professed (these two being co-incident altogether one and the same,
not only in our common form of speaking, but in all his Majesty's
proclamations) and thus as it includes, and continues within the compass
thereof, the foresaids novations and episcopacie, which under that name were
also ratified, in the first parliament holden by his Majesty. From whence it is
plain, that episcopacie not being taken away or suspended by any of his
Majesty's declarations, as these other things were which they call novations,
it must needs both in deed, and in the judgment of the said protesters no ways
be intended by his Majesty to be abjured by the said oath. Now both the major
and that part of the minor which concerns episcopal government in the Church
of Scotland, being clearly acknowledged by the protesters, and the other part
of the minor concerning that government in his other two kingdoms being
notoriously known, not only to them, but to all others who know his Majesty,
how it can be imagined that his Majesty by that oath should command episcopacy
to be abjured, or how any one to whom his Majesty's mind concerning episcopal
government was known, could honestly or safely abjure it, let it be left to the
whole world to judge, especially considering that the protesters themselves in
that place above cited, by a dilemma, which we leave to themselves to answer,
have averred, that when that act of council should come out, yet that it could
not be inferred from thence that any such thing was abjured.

Received, believed, defended by many and sundry notable kirks and Realms, but
chiefly by the kirk of Scotland, the Kings Majesty and three Estates of this
realm, as Gods eternal truth and only ground of our salvation, etc. By which
it is evident, that the subscription to this confession of faith is to be urged
in no other sense then as it was then believed and received by the Kings
Majesty, and the three Estates of this realm at that time in being; and it is
well known, that at that time Bishops, Abbots and Priors made up a third estate
of this realm, which gave approbation to this confession of faith: and
therefore it is not to be conceived, that this third estate did then abjure
episcopacie, or that episcopacie was at the first swearing of that confession
abolished. But say that at that time it was abolished by acts of general
Assembly, yet was it not so by any act of Parliament, nay by many acts of
Parliament it was in force, because none of them was repealed; some whereof are
annexed in the sheet immediately after these reasons, which we pray the reader
carefully to peruse and ponder: and at the very time of the taking of this oath
and after, bishops, whose names are well known, were in being. Now it is to be
hoped that in a Monarchy or any other well constituted republic, that damnable
Jesuiticall position shall never take place, That what is once enacted by a
Monarch and his three estates in Parliament, shall ever be held repealed or
repealable by any ecclesiastical national Synod.

By all which it is evident, that the explanation of that act of council so
groundlesly urged, can induce no man to imagine that by the confession of faith
lately sworn by his Majesty's commandment, episcopal government, which then
did, and yet does stand established by acts of this Church and Kingdom, either
was, or possibly could be abjured.

And having now (good Reader) heard his Majesty's mind in his instructions to
us, our mind in requiring in his Majesty's name this oath to be taken, and
these few reasons of many which do evidently evince the inconsequence of that
sense which without any show of inference is put upon it by those, who would go
on in making men still believe, that all which they do or say is grounded upon
authority, though they themselves do well know the contrary; we suppose that all
they who have taken this oath will rest satisfied that they have not abjured
episcopal government, and that they who shall take it, will take it in no other
sense.

Which timely warning of ours, we are the more willing to give, because we are
given to understand, that even they who were wont to call the takers of this
oath (notwithstanding of that explanation by act of council) perjured and
damned persons, and in their pulpits called the urging of it the depth of
Satan, do now mean to take it themselves, and urge others to take it in that
sense which they make men believe (though wrongfully) that act of council
makes advantageous to their ends.

But we do in his Majesty's name require that none presume to take the said
oath, unless they be required so to do by such as shall have lawful authority
from his Majesty to administer it unto them: being confident, that none either
will or can take the said oath or any other oath in any sense, which may not
consist with episcopal government, having his Majesty's sense, and so the
sense of all lawful authority fully explained to them.

THat episcopal jurisdiction was in force by acts of parliament, and no ways
abolished nor suppressed in the year 1580. nor at the time of reformation of
religion within the realm of Scotland, does evidently appear by the acts of
parliament after mentioned.

First by the parliament 1567. cap. 2. whereby at the time of reformation the
Popes authority was abolished, it is enacted by the said act, That no bishop,
nor other prelate in this realm, use any jurisdiction in time coming by the
bishop of Romes authority. And by the third act of the same parliament, whereby
it is declared, That all acts not agreeing with Gods word, and contrary to the
confession of faith approved by the estates in that parliament, to have no
effect nor strength in time to come. Whereby it is evident, that it was not the
reformers intention to suppress episcopacie, but that bishops should not use
any jurisdiction by the bishop of Rome his authority; and seeing they did allow
episcopacie to continue in the church, that they did not esteem the same
contrary to Gods word and confession foresaid: as appears more clearly by the
sixth act of the said parliament, which is ratified in the parliament 1579.
cap. 68. whereby it is declared, That the ministers of the blessed Evangel of
Jesus Christ, whom God of his mercy has now raised up amongst us, or
hereafter shall raise, agreeing with them that now live in doctrine or
administration of the sacraments, and the people of this realm that profess
Christ as he is now offered in his Evangel, and do communicate with the holy
sacraments, as in the reformed kirks of this realm they are publicly
administrate, according to the confession of the faith, to be the only true and
holy kirk of Jesus Christ within this realm; without any exception by reason
of policy and discipline, declaring only such as either gainsay the word of
the Evangel according to the heads of the said confession, or refuse the
participation of the holy sacraments as they are now ministrate, to be no
members of the said kirk so long as they keep themselves so divided from the
society of Christ's body. Whereby it is manifest, that it was not the said
reformers mind to exclude any from that society by reason of discipline, and
that they did not at that time innovate or change any thing in that policy they
found in the said kirk before the reformation.

This is likewaies evident by the oath to be ministered to the king at his
coronation, by the eighth act of the said parliament, whereby he is to swear to
maintain the true religion of Jesus Christ, the preaching of his holy word, and
due and right ministration of the sacraments now received and preached within
this realm, and shall abolish and gain-stand all false religion contrary to the
same; without swearing to any innovation of policy and discipline of the kirk.

Secondly, it does evidently appear by these subsequent acts of parliament,
that by the municipall law of this realm archbishops and bishops was not only
allowed in the kirk, but also had jurisdiction and authority to govern the same.

all civil privileges granted by our sovereign Lords predecessors to the
spiritual estate of this realm, are ratified in all points after the form and
tenor thereof. And by the 35. act of the parliament 1571. whereby all and
whatsoever acts and statutes made of before by our sovereign Lord and his
predecessors anent the freedom and liberty of the true kirk of God, are
ratified and approved.

demolished.

to direct charges to the minister of the parochin to proceed to the sentence
of excommunication.



to stand in preaching the word of Jesus Christ, correction of manners, and
administration of the holy sacraments; and yet no other authority nor
office-bearer allowed and appointed by act of parliament, nor is allowed by the
former acts; but archbishops and bishops intended to continue in their
authority, as is clear by these acts following.

to pass to the bishop, superintendent, commissioner of the kirks where they
arrive and reside, and there offer to make and give a confession of their
faith, or then within forty days to remove themselves forth of the realm.



it is ordained, that none of his Majesty's lieges and subjects presume or take
upon hand to impugn the dignity and authority of the three estates of this
kingdom, whereby the honor and authority of the kings Majesty's supreme court
of parliament, past all memory of man, has been continued, or to seek or
procure the innovation or diminution of the power and authority of the same
three estates, or any of them in time coming under the pain of treason.

That none of his highness subjects of whatsoever quality, estate, or
function they be of, spiritual or temporal presume, or take upon hand to
convocate, conveen, or assemble themselves together for holding of councels,
conventions, or assemblies, to treat, consult, or determinate in any matter of
estate, civil or ecclesiastical (except in the ordinary judgments) without
his Majesty's special commandment; or express license had and obtained to
that effect.

anent the kirk of God, and religion presently professed, are ratified.

That our sovereign Lord and his highness estates in parliament, having
special consideration of the great privileges and immunities granted by his
highness predecessors to the holy kirk within this realm, and to the special
persons exercing the offices, titles, and dignities of the prelates within the
same: Which persons have ever represented one of the estates of this realm in
all conventions of the said estates; and that the said privileges and
freedoms have been from time to time renewed and conserved in the same
integrity wherein they were at any time before. So that his Majesty
acknowledging the same to be fallen now under his Majesty's most favorable
protection, therefore his Majesty with consent of the estates declares, that
the kirk within this realm, wherein the true religion is professed, is the
true and holy kirk: And that such ministers as his Majesty at any time shall
please to provide to the office, place, title, and dignity of a bishop, etc.
shall have vote in parliament, sicklike and als freely as any other
ecclesiastical prelate had at any time bygone. And also declares, that all
bishoprics vaicking, or that shall vaick, shall be only disponed to actual
preachers and ministers in the kirk, or such as shall take upon them to exerce
the said function.

the ancient and fundamental policy, consisting in the maintenance of the
three estates of parliament, being of late greatly impaired and almost
subverted, especially by the indirect abolishing of the estate of bishops by
the act of annexation: Albeit it was never meaned by his Majesty, nor by his
estates, that the said estate of bishops, being a necessary estate of the
parliament, should any ways be suppressed; yet by dismembring and abstracting
from them of their livings being brought in contempt and poverty, the said
estate of bishops is restored, and redintegrate to their ancient and accustomed
honor, dignities, prerogatives, privileges, lands, teindes, rents, as the
same was in the reformed kirk, most amply and free at any time before the act
of annexation; rescinding and annulling all acts of parliament made in
prejudice of the said bishops in the premises, or any of them, with all that
has followed, or may follow thereupon, to the effect they may peaceably enjoy
the honors, dignities, privileges, and prerogatives competent to them or
their estate since the reformation of religion.

that archbishops and bishops are redintegrate to their former authority,
dignity, prerogative, privileges and jurisdictions lawfully pertaining and
shall be known to pertain to them, etc.



FINIS.
