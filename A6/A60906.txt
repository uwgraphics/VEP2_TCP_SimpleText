A Song upon Ale.
I.
WHen the chill Sirocco blows,
And Winter tells an heavy Tale,
When Daws, and Pyes, and Rooks and Crows
Sit cursing of the Frosts and Snows,
Then give me Ale.
II.
Ale, in a Northern Rumkin there,
Such as will make grim Malkin prate,
Makes Valor bourgeon in tall Men,
Quickens the Poets Wit and Pen,
And laughs at Fate.
III.
Ale, which the Tinkers hammer steels,
And drums it on the clamorous brass,
Larrums the Country Town and Fields,
When Madges kettles out at heels,
And torn poor Lass.
IV.
Ale, which the absent Battle fights,
And forms the march of warlike Drum,
Disputes of Princes, Laws and Rights,
What was, what is, tells Mortal Wights,
And what is to come.
V.
Ale, which the Beggars Heart up keeps,
And equals them to Tyrants Thrones,
Which wipes the Eye that over-weeps,
And lulls in sweet and gentle sleeps,
Our wearied bones.
VI.
Grandchild of Ceres, Barley's Daughter,
Wine's emulous Sister, if but stale,
Ennobling all the Nymphs of Water,
Thine half Blood, Grandmother of Laughter,
Ah, give me Ale*
Licensed and Entered according to Order.

LONDON, Printed for P. W. 1689.
