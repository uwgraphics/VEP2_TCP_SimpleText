A SHORT VIEW OF THE LIFE AND DEATH OF GEORGE VILLERS, Duke of Buckingham.

Written by Sir Henry Wotton, Knight, late Provost of Eaton College.

LONDON, Printed for William Sheares.

THE LIFE AND DEATH OF GEORGE VILLERS, Late Duke of Buckingham.
I Determine to write the life, and the end, the nature, and the fortunes, of
George Villers, late Duke of Buckingham: which yet I have not undertaken out of
any wanton pleasure in mine own pen; Nor truly without often pondering with my
self before hand what Censures I might incur: for I would not be ignorant by
long observation, both abroad and at home; That every where all Greatness of
power and favor is Circumvested with much prejudice. And that it is not easy
for writers to research with due distinction (as they ought) in the Actions of
eminent personages, both how much many have been blemished by the envy of
others, and what was corrupted by their own felicity, unless after the Period
of their splendour; which must needs Dazell their beholders and perhaps often
times themselves, we could as in some Scenes of the fabulous Age, excite them
again and confer a while with their naked Ghosts: How ever for my part: I
have no servile or ignoble end in my present labor, which may on either side
restrain or embase the freedom of my poor judgment: I will therefore steer
as evenly as I can, and deduce him from his Cradle through, the deep and
lubricke ways of State and Court, till he was swallowed in the Gulf of
falelity.

I find him borne in the year of our Savior 1592. on the 28. of August at
Brookesby in Leycester-shire, where his Ancestors had chiefly continued about
the space of fourehundred years, rather without obscurity, then with any great
luster. After they had long before been seated in Kinalton in the County of
Nottingham, he was the third son of George Villars Knight, and Mary late
Countess of Buck. and Daughter to Anthony Beaumont of Coleorton Esquier, names
on either side well known of Ancient extraction. And yet I remember there was
one, who in a wild Pamphlet which he published, besides other pitiful,
Maglignities would scant allow him to be a Gentleman. He was nurtured where he
had been borne, in his first Rudiments till the years of ten. And from thence
sent to Billisden School in the same County, where he was taught the
principalls of Music, and other slight Literature, till the Thirteenth of his
age; At which time his father dyed. Then his beautiful and provident Mother,
(for those Attributes will not be denied her) took him home to her house at
Goodby, where she had him in especial care, so as he was first, (as we may
say,) a Domesticke favorite; But finding him (as it should seem) by nature
little studious and contemplative, she chose rather to endue him with
Conversative Qualities and Ornaments of youth, as Dancing Fencing and the like,
Not without perchance even then (though far of) at a Courtiers life. To which
lessons, he had such a dexterous proclitie, as his teachers were feign to
restrain his forwardness; to the end that his brothers who were under the same
trayning might hold pace with him. About the Age of Eighteen he traveled into
France, where he improved himself well in the Language for one, that had so
little Grammatical foundation, but more in the exercises of that Nobility for
the space of three years. And yet came home in his natural plight, without
affected forms (the ordinary disease of Travelers. After his return, he
passed again one whole year (as before) at Goodby under the Winge and
Counsels of his Mother: And then was forward to become a suter at London to
Sir Roger Ashtons Daughter, a Gentleman of the Bed chamber to King James, and
Master of his Roabes, about which times, he falls into intrinsecall society
with Sir John Greham, then one of the Gentlemen of his Majesty's Privy
Chamber, who I know not upon what Luminaryes he spyed in his face, dissuaded
him from marriage, and gave him rather encouragement to woe fortune in Court,
which advise sancke well into his fancy, for within some while, the King had
taken by certain Glauaces, (where of the first was at Apthorpe in a progress)
such liking of his person, that he resolved to make him a Master-peice, and to
Mould him as it were Platonically to his own Idea. Neither was his Majesty
content only to be the Architect of his fortune, without putting his Gracious
hand likewise to some part of the work it self. Insomuch as it pleased him to
descend and to avale his goodness, even to the giving of his foresaid friend
Sir John Grcham secret directions, how and by what degrees he should bring him
into favor. But this was quickly discovered by him, who was then as yet in
some possession of the Kings heart. For there is nothing more Vigilant, nothing
more jealous, then a favorite, especially toward the wayning time and suspect
of saciety, so as many Arts were used to discuss the beginnings of new
affliction, (which lie out of my Road) being a part of another man's story) All
which notwithstanding (for I omit things intervenient) there is Conveyed to
Master Villers an intimation of the Kings pleasure to wait and to be sworn
his servant. And shortly after his Cupbearer at large; And the Summer following
he was admitted in ordinary. After which time favors came thick upon him,
(liker main showers, then sprinkling Drops or Dewes) for the next Saint
Georges-day he was Knighted and made Gentleman of the Kings-Bedchamber, and the
same very day had an Annual pension given him for his better support of one
thousand pounds out of the Court of Wards. At Newyeers-tide following the King
chose him Master of the Horse, After this he was installed of the most Noble
Order, And in the next August he Created him Baron of Whaddon, and Viscount
Villers. In January of the same year he was advanced Earl of Buckingham, and
sworn here of his Majesty's Privy Counsel: As if a favorite were not so
before, the March ensuing he attended the King into Scotland, And was likewise
sworn a Counselor in that Kingdom, whereas (I have been instructed by
unpassionate men) he did carry himself with singular sweetness and temper,
which I held very credible for it behoved him, being new in favor, and
succeeding one of their own; to study a moderate style among those generous
Spirits. About Newyeers-tyde after his return from thence (for those beginnings
of years were very propitious unto him, as if Kings did choose remarkable
days to inaugurate their favors, that they may appear Acts as well of the
times, as of the Will) he was Created Marquis of Buckingham, and made Lord
Admiral of England, Chief Justice in Air of all the Parkes and Forests in
the South Side of Trent, Master of the King's Bench office (none of the
unprofitablest pieces) Head Steward of Westminster, and Constable of
Windsor-Castle.

Here I must breath a while to satisfy some that perhaps might otherwise
wonder at such an Accumulation of benefits, like a kind of Embroidering or
listing of one favor upon another. Certainly the hearts of great Princes, if
they be considered as it were in abstract, without the necessity of States and
Circumstances of time being besides their natural extent, moreover once opened
and dilated with affection, can take no full and proportionate pleasure in the
exercise of any narrow Bounty. And albeit at first they give only upon Choice
and love of the person, yet within a while themselves likewise begin to love
their givings, and to foment their deeds, no less then Parents do their
Children: but let us go on.

For these Offices and Dignities already rehearsed and these of the like nature
which I shall after set down in their place, (were as I am ready to say) but
the facings or fringes of his greatness, in comparison of that trust, which
his last most gracious Master did cast upon him, in the one and twentieth year
of his Reign when he made him the Chief concomitant of his heir apparent,
and only son, our dear Sovereign: now being in a journey of much Adventure,
and which (to show the strength of his privacie) had been before not
communicated with any other of his Majesty's most reserved Counselors at home,
being carried with great closeness, liker a business of love then state; as it
was in the first intendment. Now because the whole Kingdom stood in a zealous
trepidation of the absence of such a Prince; I have been the more desirous to
research with some diligence, the several passages of the said journey, and
the particular Accidents of any moment in their way. They began their motion,
in the year 1623. on Tewsday the 18. of February from the Marquis his house of
late purchase; at Newhall in Essex, setting out with disguised Beards, and with
borrowed Names of Thomas and John Smith, And then attended with none, but Sir
Richard Greham Master of the Horse to the Marquess, and of in ward trust about
him. When they passed the River against Gravesend, for lack of silver they
were feign to give the Ferry-man a pecce of two and twenty shillings, which
struck the poor fellow into such a melting tenderness, that so good
Gentlemen should be going, (for so he suspected) about some quarrel beyond
Sea, as he could not forbear to acquaint the Officers of the I own, with what
had befallen him, who sent presently post for there stay at Rochester, through
which they were passed before any Intelligence could arrive. On the brow of the
Hill beyond that City, they were somewhat perplexed by espying the French
Ambassador, with the Kings Coach and other attending him, which made them
bleuch, the beaten Road, and teach Post hackneys to leap hedges. At
Canterbury, whether some voice, (as it should seem,) was run on before, the
Mayor of the Town came himself to seize on them, as they were taking fresh
Horses, in a blunt manner, alleging first a warrant to stop them from the
Council, next from Sir Lewis Lewkner Master of the Ceremonies, and lastly from
Sir Henry Manwaring then Lieutenant of Dover, Castle. At all which confused
fiction, the Marquis had no leisure to laugh, but thought best to dismaske his
beard, and so told him, that he was going covertly with such slight company to
take a secret veiw (being Admiral) of the forwardness of his Majesty's
Fleet, which was then in preparation on the Narrow Seas: this with much a do
did somewhat hansomly heal the disguisment. On the way, on afterward, the
baggage post boy, who had been at Court, got (I know not how) a glimering who
they were; But his mouth was easily shut. To Dover, though bad Horses, and
those pretty impediments, they came not before fix at night; where they found
Sir Francis Cottington then Secretary to the Prince, now Baron of Hanwart, and
Master Endimion Porter, who had been sent before to provide a Vessel for
their transportation. The foresaid Knight was enjoined for the neerenesse of
his place on the Princes affairs, and for his long Residence in the Court of
Spain, where he had gotten singular credit, even with that cautions Nation by
the temper of his Carriage. Master Porter was taken in, not only as a
Bedchamber servant of Confidence to his Highness, but likewise as a necessary
and useful Instrument for his natural skill in the Spanish tongue. And these
five were at the first the whole Parada of this journey. The next morning, for
the night was tempestuous, on the 16. of the foresaid Month taking ship at
Dover about six of the clock, they landed the same day at Bulloyn in France,
near two hours after Noone; reaching Monstruell that night: (like men of
dispatch) and Paris the second day after, being Friday the one and twentieth,
but some three posts before, they had met with two German Gentlemen that came
newly from England, where they had scene at Newmarket the Prince and the
Marquis taking Coach together with the King, and retained such a strong
impression of them both, that they now bewrayed some knowledge of their
persons; but were out faced by Sir Richard Greham, who would needs persuade
them they were mistaken: which in truth is no very hard matter, for the very
strangeness of the thing it self; and almost the impossibility to conceive so
great a Prince and favorite so suddenly Metamorphized into travelers with no
greater train, was enough to make any man living unbeleeve his five senses.
And this I suppose next the assurance of their own well resolved Carriage,
against any new accedent to have been their best Anchor in all such
Incounters. At Paris the Prince spent one whole day to give his mind some
contentment in veiwing of a famous City and Court, which was a neighbor to his
future estates, But for the better Veiling of their visages, his Highness and
the Marquess bought each of them a Perriwigge somewhat to overshaddow their
foreheads. Of the King they got a sight after dinner in a Gallery where he was
solacing himself with familiar pleasures. And of the Queen Mother as she was
at her own Table; In neither place desired, no not by Mounsier Cadinet, who
saw them in both, one has bin lately Ambassador in England. Toward Evening,
by a mere chance, in appearance, though underlined with a providence, they had
a full sight of the Queen Infanta, and of the princess Henriettae Marie, with
other great Ladies at the practice of a Masquing Dance, which was then in
preparation; having overheard two Gentlemen who were tending toward that
sight, after whom they pressed and and were let in by the Duke De Mont Basin,
the Queens Lord Chamberlain, out of humanity to strangers when diverse of the
French went by. Note here even with a point of a Diamond by what oblige steps
and immaginable preparatives, the high disposes of Princes affections does
sometimes contriue the secrets of his will, for by this casual curiosity, it
fell out that when afterward the marriage came in motion between our
Sovereign Lord and the aforesaid most Amiable Princess. It must needs be
(howsoever unknown) no small spur to the treaty, that she has not before
been altogether a stranger to his Eye.

From the next day, when they departed at three of the clock in the morning
from Paris being the 23. of February were spent six days to Bayon, the last
Town of France, having before at Bourdeaux, bought them five Riding Coats,
all of one color and fashion in a kind of Noble simplicity, where Sir Francis
Cottington was employed in a fair manner to keep them from being entertained
by the Duke De Espernon, telling him they were Gentlemen of mean degree, and
formed yet to little Courtship, who perchance might otherwise (being himself
no superficial man in the practizes of the World, have peirced somewhat deeper
then their outside.

They were now entered into the deep time of Lent, and could get no flesh in
their Innes, Whereupon fell out a pleasant passage. (If I may insert it by the
way among more ferious) there was near Bayon, a heard of Goats with their
young ones, upon which sight, the said Sir Richard Greham tells the Marquess,
he would snap one of the Kids and make some shift to carry him close to their
lodging; which the Prince over-hearing, why Richard says he, do you think you
may practice here your old tricks again upon the borders, Upon which words
they first gave the Goate-heard good contentment, and then while the Marquess
and his servant being both on foot were chasing the Kidde about the stacke,
the Prince from Horseback killed him in the head with a Scottish Pistol, let
this serve for a Iournall Parenthesis, which yet may show how his Highness
even in such slight and sportfull damage had a Noble sense of just dealing.

At Bayon, the Count De Gramont Governor of that jealouse kay took an
exquisite notice of their persons and behavour and opened himself to some of
his train; that he thought them to be Gentlemen of much more worth then their
habits bewrayed, yet he let them courteously pass. And four days after, they
arrived at Madrid, being Wednesday the fifth of March. Thus have I briefly
runned over transcursions; as if my pen had bin posting with them; which done,
I shall not need to relate the affluence of our Nobles and others from hence
into Spain, after the voice of our Prince his being there had been quickly
noysed, and at length believed, neither will I stay to consider the Arts of
Rome, where now all Engines were Whetted (though by the Divine blessing very
vainly, when they had gotten a Prince of great Britain, upon Catholic
ground as they use to call it.

This, and the whole matter of Negotiation there, the open entertainments, the
secret working, the Apprehensions on both sides, the appearance on neither. And
in sum, all the circumstances and respect of Religion and State, intermixed
together in that commicture, will better become a Royal History or a Counsel
table, then a single life, yet I cannot omit some things which intervened, at
the meeting of two Pleiades, me thinks not unlike that which Astrologers call
a conjunction of Planets, of no very benign Aspect, the one to the other; I
mean the Marquis of Buckingham, and the Conde D'Olivers: They had some
sharper, and some milder differences which might easily happen in such an
interveene of Grandes; both vehement on the parts which they swayed. But the
most remarkable was upon a supposition of the Condees, (as fancies are cheap)
that the Marquis had intimated unto her some hopes of the Prince his
conversion, which coming into debate, the Marquess so roundly disavowed this
Gilded dream, as Olivers alleged he had given him La-Mentida, and thereupon
forms a Compliment to the Prince himself; which Buckingham denying, and yet
Olivers persisting in the said Compliment, the Marquess though now in strange
hands, yet seeing both his honor and the truth at stake, was not tender
likewise to engage his life, but replied with some heat, that the Condees
asseveration would force him to do that which he had not done before, for now
he held himself tied in terms of a Gentleman, to maintain the contrary to
his affirmative in any sort whatsoever. This was the highest and the harshest
point that occurred between them; which that it went so far was not the
Dukes fault, non his fault, neither (as it should seem) that it went no
farther.

There was another memorable passage one day of gentler quality, and yet eager
enough. The Conde d' Olivers tells the Marqesse of a certain flying noise that
the Prince did plot to be secretly gone, to which the Marquis gave a well
tempered answer, that though love had made his Highness steal out of his own
Country, yet fear would never make him run out of Spain in other manner
then should become a Prince of his Royal and generous Virtues. In Spain they
stayed near eight entire months, during all which times, who but Buckingham,
lay at home under millions of male-dictions, which yet, at the Prince his safe
arrival in the West did die and vanish here and there into praises and
eligyes, according to the Contrary motions of popular waves. And now to sum
up the fruit of the journey, discourses ran thus among the cleerest
obseruers. It was said, that the Prince himself without any imaginable stain
of his Religion, had by the sight of foreign Courts, and observations of the
different natures of people, and Rules of government, much excited and awaked
his Spirits, and corroborated his judgment: And as for the Marquis, there was
note taken of two great additions which he had gained, first he was returned
with increase of title, having there been made Duke, by Patent sent him, which
was the highest degree whereof an English subject could be capable. But the
other was far greater, though closer, for by so long and so private, and so
various consociation with a Prince of such excellent nature, he had now gotten
as it were two lives in his own fortune and greatness; whereas otherwise the
estate of a favorite is at the best, but a Tennant at will, and rarely
transmitted. But concerning the Spanish Commission which in public conceit
was the maine scope of the Journey, that was left in great suspense, and after
some time utterly laid aside, which threw the Duke amongst free Wits (whereof
we have a Rank soil) under diverse Censures, the most part were apt to
believe, that he had brought down some deep distaste from Spain, which
exasperated his Councels; Neither was there wanting some other that thought him
altogether void of a little Ambition to show his power, either to knit or
dissolve. Howsoever the whole Scene of affairs was changed from Spain to
France, there now lay the prospective, which alteration being generally liked,
and all alterations of State being ever attributed to the powerfullest under
Princes; (as the manner is where the eminency of one obscureth the Rest) the
Duke became suddenly and strangely Gracious among the multitude, and was even
in Parliament highly exalted; so as he did seem for a time to have overcome
that natural Incompatability, which in the experience of all ages has been
noted between the vulgar and the Sovereign favor, but this was no more then
a moere Bubble or blast, and like an Ephemerall fit of applause as eftsoone
will appear in the sequel and train of his life; I had almost forgotten,
that after his return from Spain, he was made Lord Warden of the
Sinque-Ports (which is as it were a second Admiralty) and Steward likewise of
the Manor of Hampton Court; Dignities and Offices still growing of trust or
profit. And the King now giving not only out of a beneficient disposition, but
a very habitual and confirmed custom, one year, six Months, two days,
after the joyful reception of the Prince his son from Spain. King James of
immortal memory (among all the lovers and admirers of Divine and humane
Sapience) Accomplished at Theobals his own days on Earth, under whom the Duke
had run a long Course of Calm and smooth prosperity; I mean long for the
ordinary life of favor, and the more notable, because it had been without any
Visible Eclipse, or Wane in himself, amidst diverse variations in others.

The most importunant and pressing care of a new and Vigorous King, was his
marriage, for mediate establishment of the Royal line, wherein the Duke having
had an especial hand he was sent to conduce hither the most lovely and
Virtuous Princess Henriette Mariae, youngest daughter to the great Henry of
Burbon, of whom his Majesty as has been said, had an ambulatory view in his
travells, like a stolen taste of something that provokes appetite) He was
accompanied with none of our Peers, but the Earl of Mountgomery, now Lord
Chamberlain, a Noble Gentleman, of trusty, free, and open nature, and truly
no insuitable Associate, for that he himself likewise at the beginning of
King James, had run his Circle in the Wheeling Vicissitude of favor.

And here I must crave leave, in such of high quality or other of particular
note, as shall fall under my pen (whereof this is the first) not to let them
pass, without their due Character being part of my professed ingenuity.

Now this Ambassy, though it had a private show, being charged with more
formalitie then matter (for all the essential Conditions were before
concluded) could howsoever want no Ornaments or bravery to adorn it: among
which I am near thinking it worth of a little remembrance, that the Duke one
solemn day Georgeously clad in a suite all over-spred with Diamonds, and
having lost one of them of good Value, perchance as he might be dancing after
his manner with lofty motion. It was strangly recovered again, the next
morning in a Court full of Pages, such a diligent attendant was fortune, every
where both abroad and at home.

After this fair discharge, all civil honors having showred on him before,
there now fell out great occasions to draw forth his spirits into action, a
breach first with Spain, and not long after with France it self,
notwithstanding so straight an affinity, so lately treated with the one, and
actually accompished with other. As if indeed, according to that pleasant
Maxim of State, Kingdoms were never married, this must of necessity involue
the Duke in business enough, to have over-set a lesser Vessel, being the next
Commander under the Crown of Ports and ships.

But he was noted willingly to embrace those Overtures of public employment,
for at the Parliament at Oxford, his youth and want of experience in Maritine
service had bin somewhat shrewdly touched, even before the sleuces and
floudgates of popular liberty were yet set open; so as to wipe out that
objection, he did now mainly attend his charge, by his Majesty's untroubled
and sereen Commands, even in a tempestuous time. Now the men fell a Rubbing of
Armor, which a great while had layen oyled, The Magazines of Munition are
veiwed, The Officers of Remains called to account, frequent Counsels of
War, as many private conferences with expert Seamen, a fleet in preparation
for some attempt upon Spain.

The Duke himself personally employed to the States General. And with him
joined in full Commission the Farle of Holland, a Peer both of singular grace
and solidity, and of all sweet and serviceable virtue for public use.

These two Nobles, after a dangerous passage from Harwich, wherein three of
their Ships were foundred, arrived the fifth day at the Hage in Holland, here
they were to enter a treaty, both with the States themselves, and with the
Ministers of diverse allied, and confederate Princes, about a Common diversion
for the recovery of the Palatinate, where the Kings only Sisters Doway had
been ravished by the German Eagle, mixed with Spanish Feathers, a Princess
resplendent in darkness, and whose virtues were borne within the chance, but
without the power of fortune. Here, it were injurious to overslip a Noble act
in the Duke during this employment, which I must for my part celebrate above
all his expenses; there was a Collection of certain rare Manuscripts,
exquisitly written in Arabique and sought in the most remote parts by the
diligence of Erpinius, the most Excellent Linguist, these had been left to the
Widow of the said Erpinius, and were upon sail to the Jesuits at Autwerpe;
Licourish Chapmen of such Ware. Whereof the Duke getting knowledge, by his
worthy and learned Secretary Doctor Mason, Interverted the bargain, and gave
the poor Widow for them five hundred pounds, a sum above their weight in
silver, and a mixed act both of bounty and charity, the more laudable being
much out of his natural Element. These were they, which after his death were
as Nobly presented, as they had been bought, to the University of Cambridge,
by the Duchess Dowager, as soon as she understood by the aforesaid Doctor
Mason, her husbands intention, who had a purpose likewise (as I am well
instructed) to raise in the said University (whereof he was Chancellor) a
fair case for such Monuments, and to furnish it with other choice collections
from all parts of his own charge, perchance in some Emulation of that famous
Treasury of knowledge at Oxford: without parallel in the Christian world. But
let me resume the file of my relation, which this Object of books (best
agreeable to my course of life) has a little interrupted, the aforesaid
Negotiation though prosecuted with heal and probable appaof great effects,
took up a Month before the Dukes return from his excentricity (for so I
account favorites abroad) and then at home he met with no good News of the
Cadez Attempt: In the preparation thereof, though he had spent much solicitude
ex officio, yet it principally failed (as was thought) by late setting out, and
by some contrary ty of Weather at Sea; whereby the particular design took
ve^^ beforehand, a point hardly avoydable in actions of noise, especially
where the great Indian Key to all Cabinets is working. Not long after this, the
King pondering in his Wisdom the weight of his foreign Affairs, found it fit
to call a Parliament at Westminster; this was that Assembly where there
appeared a sudden and mavelous conversion in the Dukes Case, from the most
exalted, as he had been, both in another Parliament, and in common voice
before) to the most depressed now, as if his condition had been capable of no
Mediocrities. And it could not but trouble him the more, by happening when he
was so freshly returned out of the Low-Provinces, out of a meritorious
employment, in his inward conceit and hope, which being the single example that
our Annals have yielded, from the time of William de la Pool, Duke of Suffolk,
under Henry the sixth, of such a concurrence of two extremes, within so short
time, by most of the same Commenders and disprovers, like the Natural breath
of man, that can both heat and cool) would require no slight memorial of the
particular Motives of so great a change, but that the whole Case was dispersed
by the Knights of Shires, and Burgesses of Towns, through all the Veins of the
Land, and may be taken by any at pleasure, out of the Parliament Registers:
Besides that, I observe it not usual amongst the best patterns, to stuff the
report of particular lives, with matters of public record, but rather to dive
(as I shall endeavor, before I wipe my pen) into secret and proper
afflictions; howsoever somewhat I must note in this strange Phenomenon: It
began from a traveled Doctor of Physic, of bold spirit, and of able
Elocution; who being returned one of the Burgesses (which was not ordinary in
any of his Coat) fell by a Metaphorical Allusion, translate from his own
Faculty, to propound the Duke as a main cause of diverse infirmities in the
State, or near that purpose; being sure enough of Seconds, after the first
Onset, in the Lower House. As for any close intelligence that they had
beforehand with some in the higher (though that likewise was said, I want
ground to affirm or believe it more then a general conceit) which perhaps
might run of the working of envy amongst those that were nearest the object
which we see so familiar, both in natural and moral causes, the Dukes answers
to his appeachments, in number thirteen, I find very diligently and civilly
couched: and though his heart was big, yet they all savor of an humble spirit
one way, equitable consideration, which could not possess every vulgar
conceit, and somewhat allay the whole matter, that in the bolting and sifting
of near foureeen years of such power and favor, all that came out, could not
be expected to be pure and white and fine Meal, but must needs have withal
among it a certain mixture of Padar and Bran, in this lower age of humane
fragility: howsoever this tempest did only shake, and not rent his sayls; for
His Majesty's considering that almost all his appeachments were without the
compass of his own Reign; and moreover, That nothing alleged against him,
had, or could be proved by Oath, according to the Constitution of the House of
Commons, which the Duke himself did not forget in the Preface of his answers.
And lastly, having had such experience of his fidelity and observance abroad,
where he was chief in trust, and in the participations of all hazards, sound
himself engaged in honor, and in the sense of his own natural goodness, to
support him at home from any further inquietude, and too dear buy his highest
testimony of diverse important imputations, whereof the truth is best known to
His Majesty while he was Prince. The Summer following, this Parliament (after
an Embark of our trading Ships in the River of Bourdeaux, and other points of
Sovereign affront there did succeed the action of Rbez) wherein the Duke was
personally employed on either element, both as Admiral and General, with hope
in that service to recover the public good will, which he saw by his own
example might quickly be won and lost: This action as I hear has been
delivered by a Noble Gentleman of much learning and active spirits, himself the
fitter to do it right, which in truth he greatly wanted, having found more
honorable censure even from some of the French Writers then it had generally
amongst our selves at home; Now because the said work is not yet flowing into
the light, I will but sweep the way with a few notes, and there only touching
the Dukes own deportment in that Island the proper subject of my quill, for in
the general survey of this action, there was matter of glory and grief so
equally disturbnted on both sides, as if fortune had meant we should quickly be
friends again, wherein let their names that were bravely lost, be rather
memorized in the full table of time, for my part I love no ambitious pains in
an eloquent description of mseries. The Dukes carriage was surely Noble
throughout to the Gentlemen of fair respect, bountiful to the Soldier,
according to any special value which he spyed in any, tender and careful of
those that were hurt, of unquestionable Courage in himself and rather fearful
of fame, then danger: In his countenance, which is the part that all eyes
interpret, no open alteration even after the succors which he expected did
fail him; but the less he showed without, the more it wrought intrinsically,
according to the nature of suppressed passions: for certain it is, That to his
often mentioned Secretary, Doctor Mason, whom he laid in a Pallet near him, for
natural Ventilation of his thoughts, he would, in the absence of all other
ears and eyes, break out into bitter and passionate Eruptions, protesting, That
never his dispatches to diverse Princes, nor the great business of a Fleet of
an Army, of a Siege, of a Treaty, of War, of Peace, both on soot together, and
all of them in his head at a time, did not so much break his report, as a
conceit, That some at home, under His Majesty, of whom he had well deserved,
were now content to forget him; but whom he meant, I know not, and am loath to
rove at conjectures. Of their two Forts, he could not take the one, not he
would not take the other; but in the general Town he maintained a seizure and
possession of the whole, three full months, and eighteen days; and at the
first descent on shore, he was not immured within a wooden Vessel, but he did
countenance the landing in his long Boat; where succeeded such a defeat of near
two hundred Horse (and these not by his guess) mounted in haste, But the most
part Gentlemen of Family, and great resolution, seconded with 2000 Foot, as all
circumstances well balanced on either side, may surely endure a comparison
with any of the bravest Impressions in ancient time: in the issue of the whole
business, he seems charged in opinion with a kind of improvident conscienee,
having brought off that with him to Camp, perchance too much from a Court,
where Fortune had never deceived him: Besides, we must consider him yet but
rude in the profession of Arms, though greedy of honor, and zealous in the
cause. At his return to Plymouth, a strange accident befell him, perchance not
so worthy of memory for it self, as for that it seems to have been a kind of
prelude to his final period.

The now Lord Goring a Gentleman of true honor, and of vigilant affections for
his friend, sends to the Duke in all expedition an express messenger, with
advisement to assure his own Person, by declining the ordinary Road to London,
for that he had credible intelligence of a plot against His life to be put in
Execution upon him in his said journey toward the Court: The Duke meeting the
messenger on the way, read the Letter, and smothering it in his pocket without
the least imaginable apprehension, rides forwards: His Company being about that
time not above seven or eight in number, and those no otherwise provided for
their defense, then with ordinary swords: after this, the Duke had advanced
three miles before he met with an old woman near a Town in the road, who
demanded whether the Duke were in the Company; and bewraying some especial
occasion to be brought to him, was lead to his horse side, where she told him
that in the very next Town where He was to pass, she had heard some desperate
men vow his death: And thereupon would have directed him about by a surer way,
this old woman's casual access joined with that deliberate advertisement which
he had before from his noble friend, moved him to participate both the tenor of
the said Letter and all the circumstances, with his Company, who were jointly
upon consent that the woman had advised him well; Notwithstanding all which
importunity, he resolved to wave his way upon this reason, perhaps more
generous then provident, that if as he said she, should but once by such a
diversion malte his enemy believe he were afraid of danger, he should never
live without: Hereupon his young Nephew, Lord Viscount Fielding being then in
his Company, out of a noble spirit besought him that he would at least honor
him with his Coat and blew Riban through the Town, pleading that his Uncles
life whereon lay the property of his whole Family was of all things under
heaven the most precious unto him; and undertaking so to gesture and muffell up
himself in his hood, as the Dukes manner was to ride in cold weather, that none
should discern him, from him; And so he should be at the more liberty for his
own defense, at which sweet proposition, the Duke caught him in his arms and
kissed him; yet would not as he said accept of such an offer in that case, from
a Nephew whose life he tendered as much as himself: And so liberally rewarded
the poor creature for her good will; after some short directions to his Company
how they should carry themselves, he road on without perturbation of his mind,
he was no sooner entered into the Town, but a scambling Soldier clapped hold of
his bridle, which thought it was in a begging or perchance somewhat worse, in a
drunken fashion, yet a Gentleman of his train that road a pretty distance
behind him, conceiving by the premises it might be a beginning of some
mischevious intent, spurred up his horse, and with a violent roush severed him
from the Duke, who with the rest went on quickly through the Town, neither for
ought I can hear was there any further inquiry into that practice, the Duke
peradventure thinking it wisdom not to reserve discontentments to deep, at his
return to the Court he found no change in Fates, but smothered murmurings for
the loss of so many gallant Gentlemen, against which his friends did oppose in
their discourses the chance of War, together with a gentle expectation for want
of supply in time, after the complaints in Parliament, and the unfortunate
issue at Rbez, the Dukes fame did still remain more and more in obliquie among
the mass of people, whose judgments are only reconciled with good successes,
so as he saw plainly that he must abroad again to rectify with his best
endeavor under the public service, his own reputation; Whereupon new
preparatives were in hand, and partly reparatives of the former beaten at Sea:
And in the mean while, he was not unmindfull in his civil course to cast an
eye upon the ways to win unto him such as have been a principle credit in the
Lower house of Parliament, applying lenities, or subducting from that part
where he knew the humors were sharpest, amidst which thoughts, he was surprised
with a fatal stroke, written in the black book of necessity.

There was a younger brother of mean fortunes born in the County of Suffolk, by
name John Felton, by nature of a deep melancholy, silent, and glony
constitution, but bred in the active way of a soldier, and thereby raised to
the place of Lieutenant to a foot-company in the Regiment of Sir James Ramsey,
this was the man that closely within himself had concealed the Dukes death. But
what may have been the immediate or greatest motive of that fellonious
conception, is even yet in the clouds.

It was said at first that he had been stung with a denial of his Captains
place, who dyed in England, whereof thus much indeed is true, that the Duke
before he would invest him in the said place, advising first (as his manner
was) with his Colonel, he found him to interpret for one Powell his own
Lieutenant, a Gentleman of extraordinary valor, and according to millitary
custom, the place was good, that the Lieutenant of the Colonells company might
well pretend to the next vacant Captain-ship under the same Regiment, which
Felton acknowledged to be in it self very usual and equitable, besides the
special merit of the person, so as aforesaid conceit of some rancour harbored
upon their denial had no true ground; there was no other imagination that
between a Knight of the same County, whom the Duke had lately taken into some
good degree of favor, and the said Felton, there had been ancient quarrels
not yet well healed, which might perhaps lie festring in his breast; and by a
certain inflammation product this effect; but that carries small probability
that Felton would so deface his own act, as to make the Duke no more then an
oblique sacrifice, to the fames of his private revenge upon a third person:
therefore the truth is, that either too honest a deed after it was done, or to
stumber his conscience in the doing, he studied other incentives, alleging
not three hours before his execution to Sir Richar Gresham two only inducements
thereof. The first, as he made it in order, was a certain libellous book
written by one Eggleston a Scottish Physician, which made the Duke one of the
foulest Monsters upon the earth, and indeed unworthy not only of life in a
Christian Court, and under so virtuous a King; but of any room within the
bounds of all humanity, if his prodigious predictions had the least semblance
of truth.

The second, was the Remonstrance it self of the Lower House of Parliament
against him, which perchance he thought the fairest cover, so he put in the
second place, whatsoever were the true motive, which I think none can
determine, but the Prince of darkness it self; he did thus prosecute the
effect. In a by-Cutlers shop on Tower hill, he bought a ten-penny knife (so
cheap was the instrument of this great attempt, and the sheath thereof he sewed
to the lining of his pocket) that he might at any moment draw forth the Blade
alone with one hand, for he had maimed the other: This done, he made shift,
partly, as it is said, on horse back and partly on foot, to get to Portsmouth,
for he was indigent and low in money, which perhapps might have a little edged
his desperation, at Portsmoutb on Saturday being the 23. of August of that
current year, he pressed without any suspicion in such a time of so many
pretenders to employment, into an inward Chamber where the Duke was at
breakefast (the last of his repasts in this world) accompanied with men of
quality and action, with Monsier-de Soubes, and Sir Thomas Friar, and there a
little before the Dukes rising from the table, he went and stood expecting till
he should Pass through a kind of Lobye between that room and the next, where
diverse attending him; toward which passage, as I conceive somewhat darker then
the Chamber, which he voided, while the Duke came with Sir Thomas Friar close
at his ear, in the very moment as the said Knight withdrew himself from the
Duke, a Safinate gave him with a back blow a deep wound into his left side,
leaving the knife in his body, which the Duke himself pulling out, on a sudden
effusion of spirits, he sunk down under the table in the next room, and
immediately expired. Certain it is, that some good while before Sir Clement
Throckmorton, a Gentleman then living, of grave judgment, had in a private
conferrence advised him to wear a privy Coat, whose Council the Duke received
very kindly; but gave him this answer, that against any popular farie a shirt
of mayle would be but a silly defense, and as for any single man's assault he
took himself to be no danger: So dark is destiny.

One thing in this enormious accident, is, I must confess, to me beyond all
wonder (as I received it from a Gentleman of judicious and diligent
observation, and one whom the Duke well favored) That within the space of not
many minutes after the fall of the body, and removal thereof into the first
room, there was not a living creature in either of the chambers, no more then
if it had lien in the Sands of AEthiopia; whereas commonly, in such cases, you
shall note every where a great and sudden conflux of people unto the place, to
hearken and to see: But it should seem the very horror of the fact, had
stupefied all curiosity, and so dispersed the multitude, that it is thought
even the murderer himself might have escaped (for who gave the blow none could
affirm, if he had not lingered about the house below, not by any confused arrest
of conscience (as has been seen in like examples) but by very pride in his own
deed, as if in effect there were little difference between being remembered by a
verteous fame, or an Illustrious infamy.

Thus died this great Peer in the 36th year of his age complete, and three
days over, in a time of great recourse unto him, and dependence upon him, the
house and Town full of servants and suitors: His Duchess in an upper room,
scarce yet out of her bed, and the Court at that time not above six or nine
miles from him, which had been the stage of his greatness.

I have spent some enquiry whether he had any ominous presagement before his
end; wherein though both ancient and modern Stories have been infected with
much vanity; yet oftentimes things fall out of that kind which may bear a sober
constitution, whereof I will glean two or three in the Dukes case.

Being to take his leave of my Lords Grace of Canturbury, the only Bishop of
London, whom he knew well planted in the Kings unchangeable affection, by his
own great abilities, after cortefies of courage had passed between them, My,
Lord says the Duke, I know your Lordship has very worthily good accesses unto
the King our Sovereign, let me pray you to put His Majesty in mind to be good,
as I no way distrust, to my poor wife and children: at which words or at his
countenance in the delivery, or at both, My Lord Bishop being somewhat
troubled, took the freedom to ask him where he had never any secret abodements
in hi mind. No (replied the Duke) but I think some adven ture may kill me as
well as another man.

The very day before he was slain, feeling some indisposition of body, the King
was pleased to give him the hoonur of a visit, and found him in his bed; where,
and after much serious and private discourse, The Duke at His Majesty's
departing, embraced him in a very unusual and passionate manner, and in like
sort to his friend the Earl of Holland, as if his soul had divined he should
see them no more, which infusions toward fatal ends, had been observed by
some Authors of no light authority.

On the very day of his death, the Countess of Denbigh received a Letter from
him; whereunto all the while she was writing her answer, she bedewed the paper
with her tears: And after a m^st bitter passion (whereof she could yield no
reason, but, That her dearest brother was to be gone) she fell down in a
swound. Her said letter ends thus:

I will pray for your happy return, which I look at with a great cloud ever my
bead, too heavy for my poor heart to bear without torment i but I hope the
great God of heaven will bless you.

The day following, the Bishop of Ely, her devoted friend, who was thought the
fittest preparer of her mind to receive such a doleful accident, came to
visit her; but hearing she was at rest, he attended till she should awake of
her self, which she did with the affrightment of a dream, Her brother seeming
to pass through a field with her in her Coach; where hearing of a sudden shout
of the people, and asking the reason, it was answered to have been for joy that
the Duke of Buckingham was sick. Which natural Impression she scarce had
related unto her Gentlewoman, before the Bishop was entered into her Bedchamber
for a chofen Messenger of the Dukes death.

This is all that I dare present of that nature to any of judgment, not
unwillingly omitting certain prognostic Anagrams, and such strains of fancy.

He took to wife, eight years and two months before his death, the Lady
Katherine Manners, Heir general to the Noble House of Rutland; who besides a
solid addition to his estate, brought him three sons and a daughter, called the
Lady Mary, his first born; his eldest son died at Nurse, before his journey at
Rbez; and his third, the Lord Francis, was born after his fathers death; so as
neither his first nor his last were participant of any sense of his misfortunes
or felicities: His second son, now Duke of Buckingham was born, to cheer him
after his return from that unlucky Voyage.

For these sweet pledges, and no less for the unquestionable virtues of her
person and mind, he loved her dearly, and well expressed his love in an act
and time of no simulation toward his end, bequeathing her all his
Mansion-houses during her natural life, and a power to dispose of his whole
personal estate, together with a fourth part of his Lands in Jointure: He left
his elder brother of the same womb a Viscount, and his younger an Earl; Sir
Edward Villers, his half brother on the fathers side, he either preferred or
removed (call it how hou will) from his step-mothers eye to the presidentship,
where he lived in singular estmation for his justice and hospitality; and died
with as much. grief of the whole Providence, as ever any Governor did before
his Religious Lady of sweet and Noble direction, adding much to his honor. The
eldest of the brethren, and heir of the Name, was made a Baronet; but abstained
from Court, enjoying perhaps the greater greatness of self fruition.

He left his mother a Countess by Patent, in her own person, which was a new
leading example, grown before somewhat rare, since the days of Queen Mary. His
sister of Denbigh (that right character of a good Lady) he most humbly
recommended to the Queen; who alter a discharge of some French in her Court
that were to return, took her into three several places of honor and trust.

In short, not to insist upon every particular Branch of those private
preferments, he left all his female kindred, of the entire or half blood,
descending of the name of Villers or Beaumont, within any near degree, either
matched with Peers of the Realm actually, or hopefully, with Earls sons and
heirs, or at least with Knights, or Divinity, and of plentiful condition. He
did not much strengthen his own substance in Court, but stood there on his own
feet; for the truth is, the most of his Allies rather leaned upon him, then
shoared him up.

His familiar servants, either about his person in ordinary attendance, or
about his affairs of State, as his Secretaries; or of Office, as his Steward;
or of Law, as that worthy Knight whom he long used to solicit his causes: He
left all both in good Fortune, and, which is more, in good Fame.

Things very seldom consociated in the Instruments of great Personages.

FINIS.
