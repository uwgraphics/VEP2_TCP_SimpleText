By the King and Queen, A PROCLAMATION, For a Public THANKSGIVING.
WILLIAM R.

WHereas Their Majesty's having a deep and serious Consideration of the War in
which they (together with most of the Princes and States of Europe) were and
still are engaged against the French King, did, by Their Royal Proclamation,
bearing Date the Thirteenth Day of April last, Appoint a general Monthly Fast
to be kept throughout this Kingdom, for Imploring the Blessing and Protection
of Almighty God in the Preservation of Their Majesty's Sacred Persons, and
Prosperity of Their Arms both at Land and Sea, which has been observed
accordingly: And forasmuch as it has pleased Almighty God of his Infinite
Goodness in Answer to the Prayers humbly and devoutly Offered up to him, to
preserve Their Majesty's and Their Government against the Designs and Attempts
of Their Open and Secret Enemies; And to Protect His Majesty's Person from the
many and great Dangers of the War in His late Expedition beyond the Seas; And
to bring Him back in Safety to this Kingdom: Their Majesty's therefore Adoring
the Divine Goodness and duly Considering that such Great and Public Blessings
do call for Public and Solemn Acknowledgments, Have thought fit, and (with the
Advice of Their Privy Council) do hereby Appoint and Command, That a General
Thanksgiving to Almighty God for these his Mercies be observed throughout Our
Cities of London and Westminster, and elsewhere within the weekly Bills of
Mortality, on Sunday the Twelfth day of this Instant November; and in all other
Places throughout this Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of
Berwick upon Tweed, on Sunday the Six and twentieth day of this Instant
November. And for the better and more orderly Solemnizing of the same, Their
Majesty's have given Directions to the Most Reverend Archbishops, and Right
Reverend Bishops of this Kingdom, to Compose a Form of Prayer suitable to this
Occasion, to be Used in all Churches and Chapels, and other Places of Public
Worship, and to take Care for the timely dispersing of the same throughout
their respective Diocesses. And Their Majesty's do strictly Charge and Command,
That the said Public Days of Thanksgiving be Religiously Observed by all Their
Loving Subjects, as they tender the Favor of Almighty God, and upon Pain of
Suffering such Punishments as Their Majesty's can justly Inflict for the
Contempt or Neglect thereof.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Second Day of November, 1693. In the
Fifth Year of Our Reign.
