The Unhappy TAILOR OR, Loves Fatal Farwell, being a Tragical Relation of one
James Orde a Tailor; Who Hanged himself on Sunday Morning in the new Buildings
near Lamb's Cunduit, for Love of a Young Maiden who slighted his Courtship.
To the Tune of Johnson's Farewell
Licensed according to Order.

COme all Rash Lovers pray draw near,
and hear what I shall tell,
Of one who lately did despair,
and for that cause he fell:
He was Tailor brisk and brave,
who loved a handsome Maid,
And did for speedy Marriage crave,
but she the same delaid.
Which drove him to such discontent,
that he no rest could find,
Both Night and Day he did lament,
to see his Love unkind;
And took the same so much to heart,
in silence he did grieve,
Such was the force of Cupids Dart,
that none could him relieve.
Until at last despair and grief
united so their Power,
His Case was far beyond relief,
sad Fate must him devour.
For having got a slender Roap
on Sunday-morning last,
As one being void of future hope,
he hanged himself in have.
In the New-building near the Field,
his body it was found,
Where, he to fatal death did yield,
though his feet touched the Ground;
Which did amaze all those who see
his sad and dismal fate,
Because that Loves unkind Decree,
had thus cut off his date.
About him were some Letters found.
Which plainly seemed to tell,
Dispare had on him gained such ground,
In peace he could not Dwell
Likewise he did disire all,
Who heard of his sad Fate
To take example by his Fall,
Before it was too late.
His Sweet heart she no sooner hears,
This sad and Doleful news
But she with Sorrows Grief and Tears
All comfort does refuse,
For her unkindness to her Dear,
She does Lament and Morn,
'Cause to him she was so severe
As her True Love to scorn.
Oh! all Young Maid's (quoth she beware
How you true love despise,
Least you like me, bring on dispare,
Make Love a sacrifice
I freely would give all I have,
To bring him back again,
But it is too late his Life to save
My sighs are all in vain.
London, Printed for John Alkin, 1699.
