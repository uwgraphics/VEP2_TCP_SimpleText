TORRINGTONIA, OR, A New Copy of Verses ON THE Late Sea Engagement.
To a Tune, Which nobody can deny.
I Sing not the Battle (so Famed) of Lepanto,
Nor what the Turks got by the Siege of Otranto,
Nor the Spanish Armada so brave and gallanto
Which no body can deny.
Nor how they were banged by Invincible Drake,
Nor the Courage and Conduct of Excellent Blake,
Nor of Men that Fought bravely when all was at Stake
Which, etc.
But a sort of Sea Fight 'tween the French and Hollander,
Where the English had joined, but that their Comm -- der
In Chief, would not be a with- but a by-stander
Which, etc.
The Dutch to the Enemy boldly drew near,
But the Adm -- ral o'th English more wisely did steer,
For he thought it was safer to keep in the Rear
Which, etc.
Grafton ('it was said) came courageously in,
And by mauling the French great honor did win,
But Torr' was resolved to sleep in a whole Skin
Which, etc.
Had each Ship and its Captain but been Independent,
They Would certainly made a more glorious end on it,
Then Commanded by such a stout superintendant
Which, etc.
Tyrrel and Dorrel did boldly stand to 'em,
(Thinking to beat the French and to undo 'em,)
But th'Adm -- l only came thither to view 'em
Which, etc.
And tho the French Fleet was so little esteemed,
And their Courage and Conduct despisable deemed,
To wise Herb -- t they plainly Invincible seemed
Which, etc.
Some Ships too Foolhardy did headlong engage,
Which put the Stout Adm -- l in such a rage,
That naught but a W -- could his passion assuage
Which, etc.
When the Shot from the Enemy flying at random
Slew the stout Hero's Dog, that could no way withstand 'em,
His Bit -- s desired their Master to land 'em
Which, etc.
'Twould make a Man, much more a Woman, aghast Sir,
To see a Dog killed 'twixt the Legs of his Master,
Who much more deserved such a dismal disaster
Which, etc.
Some say that he wanted both Powder and Ball,
Be that true or false, it was certainly all
One to him, whose Courage was so very small
Which, etc.
The Dutch at the Enemy bravely did Fire all,
Though Art -- ur commanded the Fleet to retire all,
For which if he be'nt H -- g'd we much should Admire all
Which, etc.
Tho the French for a time may bluster and boast
Of the Honor they won, by T -- n lost,
Their Courage will cool when our Fleet's on their Coast
Which, etc.
Not One Town of theirs, nor Two, Three nor Four
Shall appease for the pranks they played on our Shore.
We have Admirals now that will pay off the Score
Which, etc.
Printed at the request of a Tarr. For the diversion of the Melancholy Widows
of Wapping.
