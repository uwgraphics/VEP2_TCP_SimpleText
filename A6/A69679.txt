POPERY: OR, THE Principles and Positions Approved by the CHURCH OF ROME ( When
Really Believed and Practiced) Are very Dangerous to all; and to Protestant
Kings and Supreme Powers, more especially Pernicious: And Inconsistent with
that Loyalty, which (by the Law of NATURE and SCRIPTURE) is Indispensably due
to SUPREME POWERS.

In a LETTER to a Person of Honor; By T. Ld Bishop of LINCOLN.

Rev. 18. 4. Jer. 15. 6. Come out of her my people, least ye be partakers of
her Sins and Plagues.

In the SAVOY: Printed by Tho. Newcomb, for James Collins in the Temple-passage
from Essex-street. MDCLXXIX.

FOR MY Honored Friend L. N. P.
SIR,
I Received and read your Letter, and this comes to (bring my humble Service,
and) tell you so. In your Letter you tell me, First, Of an Inhumane and Bloody
Design and Popish Plot, a Traitorous and Roman Catholic Conspiracy (as you
call it) against the Sacred Person and Life of our Gracious KING, (whom GOD
preserve) and many more (by them) designed for Ruin, and for the Subversion of
the true Religion Established by Law, and introducing Papal Tyranny,
Superstition and Idolatry. A Design not only Unchristian, but Inhumane and
Barbarous; beyond all examples of Turkish or Pagan Cruelty; nor has it (in any
story) any parallel Impiety; unless perhaps, that Bloody Nuptiae Parisinae and
Laniena Protestantium in Gallia, Anno 1572. Vide Thuanum, ad dictum Annum.
French Massacre, or the Gun-powder-Treason; all contrived and carried on, by
Men of the same desperate Principles, and (though with the blood and ruin of
many thousand innocent persons) to advance the Papal Interest. Secondly, You
say, That the Popish Party decry this Impious Conspiracy, as a State-Trick
(without truth or reallity) to make Catholics (as they commonly miscall
themselves) odious to the People, and this whole Nation. This I believe (and
know) they do. As their Plots and Conspiracies, so their Impudence to deny or
lessen them, (when discovered) is monstrous, and (were not their Persons and
Principles known) incredible. So they did, (where, and when they durst) and
still do In an Almanac commonly sold, since His Majesty's Happy Return;
called, Calendarium Catholicum; the Gun-powder-Treason is called, Cecil's
Contrivance. It was printed 1662.
call the Gun-powder-Treason, A State-Design, to make them (though they were
innocent) seem guilty, and Criminals. Thirdly, Lastly, you say, that several
Papists tell you, (in excuse of Popery, and their Party) That if indeed there
be such a Plot and Conspiracy, (as is pretended) yet it is the only fault of
those persons concerned in it, not of Popery, or their Religion; the Principles
and Doctrine of their Church, giving no ground or encouragement to such impious
and Anti-Monarchical practices. This I believe too; because I find them making
the same Apology for themselves, to take off the guilt of the
Gun-powder-Treason. For (without all truth or modesty) they tell us in Print;
The aforesaid Popish Calendarium Catholicum, or Catholic Almanac, at the end
of it, about Holy Days set apart by Act of Parliament.
That the Gun-powder-Treason was MORE THAN SUSPECTED, to be the CONTRIVANCE of
Cecil, the great Politician, TO RENDER CATHOLICS ODIOUS; and that there were
but VERY FEW of that Religion, (AND THOSE DESPERADOES TOO) detected of it, etc.
All And yet Ribadaneira* Bzovius, etc. reckon those Gunpowder Traitors amongst
the eminent Martyrs for their Church and Religion; as you shall see anon. And
Father Parsons calls Garnet (Executed for High Treason, and the Gunpowder
Conspiracy).......... An Innocent Man, who suffered Unjustly; that he lived a
SAINTS Life, and accomplished the same with an HAPPY DEATH, dying in DEFENSE of
JUSTICE. In his Book against the Oath of Allegiance; called, A Discussion of
the Answer of Dr. William Barlow, etc. p. 22, 23.
sober Catholics detesting that, and all such Conspiracies.

Now these things premised, you desire to know of me, whether I think these
their Allegations and Apologies true; or if I think them untrue and
insignificant (as you may be sure I do) that I would give you some reasons why
I do so. In obedience therefore to your command, and to satisfy that
Obligation that lies upon me (so far as I am able) to Vindicate Truth, and my
Mother the Church of England; (though I have little time, and few Books here
(being absent from my own) save what I borrow of friends) I shall endeavor to
say something, which may (I hope) be pertinent, toward the conviction of our
Adversaries, and your satisfaction. And here, I shall plainly set down,

I. The Position I undertake to make good. II. The Proofs and Reasons of it.
I. The Position is this...... The Doctrine and Principles of Popery, owned by
the Church of Rome ( when believed and practiced) are not only dangerous, but
pernicious to Kings, (especially to those who are Protestants) prejudicial to
the just rights of Monarchy, and inconsistent with that Loyalty, which (by the
Laws of Nature and Scripture) is due to them; and particularly to our Kings, by
the established and known Laws of England, made anciently, even by Popish Kings
and Parliaments, against Papal Usurpations, and Anti-Monarchical Practices. And
here (because it is impossible distinctly to show, how Popish Principles are
dangerous to our Kings, and prejudicial to their Just Rights, and Royal
Prerogative; unless we first know, what that Prerogative, and those Rights are)
I shall inquire,

1. What the Jura Coronae, the Rights and Prerogatives of the Imperial Crown of
England are, as to our present concern. 2. How Popish Doctrines and Principles,
may be dangerous, or pernicious to them.
1. For the First; That England is a Monarchy, the Crown Imperial, and our
Kings SUPREME Governors, and SOLE SUPREME Governors of this Realm, and all
other their Dominions, will (I believe, I am sure it should) be granted; seeing
our Authentic Laws and Statutes do so expressly, and so often say it. In our
Oath of Supremacy we Swear, that the King is, the ONLY SUPREME Governor.
SUPREME, so none (not the Pope) above Him: and ONLY SUPREME; so none
coordinate, or equal to Him. So that by our known Laws, our King is, Solo Deo
minor, invested with such a Supremacy, as excludes both Pope and People (and
all the World, God Almighty only excepted, by whom Kings Reign) from having any
Power, Jurisdiction, or Authority over Him. For this Sovereignty and Supremacy
belonging to our Kings, and the Imperial Crown of England is asserted, not only
by the Statutes of Vid. Stat. 1. Eliz. cap. 1. 5. Eliz. cap. 1. and 13. Eliz.
cap. 2.
Q. Elizabeth, Vid. 1. Jac. cap. 7. and 3. Jac. cap. 4.
King James, and Vid. 12. Car. 2. cap. 30. In the Preamble.
Charles the Second, (Protestant Princes) but even those Statutes made by
Popish Princes and Parliaments, declare the same: I instance only in Statut.
16. Rich. 2. cap. 5.
Richard the Second, Statut. 24. Hen. 8. cap. 12. and 25. Hen. 8. cap. 19. and
37. Hen. 8. cap. 17. and 26. Hen. 8. cap. 1.
Henry the Eighth, and Parliamentum secundum 2. Mariae, cap. 1.
Q. Mary; (though all the Statutes of Provisors, were pertinent to this
purpose.) That Richard the Second and His Parliament were Roman Catholics, is
manifest; and it is as certain, That Henry the Eighth and His Parliaments (when
the Statutes cited were made) were so too. For it is evident, that those
Statutes were made Anno. 24. and Anno. 25. Hen. 8. that is, Anno. Dom. 1532.
and 1533. when neither He, nor His Adherents, were Excommunicate, but actual
Members of the Roman Church then, and for some years after. For though Pope
Paul the Third was angry, and about it, Anno. 1535. yet he did not actually
Excommunicate him or his Adherents, before the year The Bull by which Hen. 8.
was Excommunicate, was Dat. Romae 16. Call. Januarii* Pauli Papae 3. Anno 5.
Vid. Bullarium Cherubini, Tom. 1. page 704 Edit. Lugduni. 1655.
1538. which was six years after Henry the Eighth, and His Popish Parliament
had Vindicated the Rights of the Imperial Crown of England, against the
irrational and unjust Pretenses and Usurpations of the Pope; and declared, that
the Supremacy (both in Ecclesiastical and Civil Things) ever did ( de Jure)
belong to the Imperial Crown of England, not to the Pope's Mitre: He having no
more to do in England, (Jure proprio, or by any Law of God or Man) than Henry
the Eighth in Italy. And that Parliament of Queen Mary, (cited in the Margent)
although a Popish Parliament, yet declares fully for the Queen's Supremacy,
(which, to some may seem strange) for that Act expressly says, 1. That the
IMPERIAL CROWN of this Realm, with all its Prerogatives, Jurisdictions, etc.
was descended to the Queen. 2. That she was the SOVEREIGN and SUPREME Governor
of all Her Dominions, in AS FULL, LARGE, and AMPLE MANNER, AS ANY OF HER
PROGENITORS, (therefore in as ample a manner as Her Father Henry the Eighth.)
3. That by the MOST ANCIENT LAWS of this Realm, the punishment of ALL
OFFENDERS, against the Regality and Laws of this Realm, belonged to the King,
etc. So that even a Popish Parliament acknowledges and declares, the Kings of
England possessed of such a Supremacy, over all Persons, and that by our MOST
ANCIENT Laws, that He may punish ALL OFFENDERS (Clergy or Laity) against the
Laws, and His Regality. (How contradictory to this, the Trent Council and the
Doctrine of the Roman Church is, you shall see anon.) But for the Supremacy of
the Kings of England, (according to our Ancient and Later Laws, I refer you to
the Vid. Coke's Reports, Part. 5. de Jure Regis Ecclesiastico; and Calvin's
Case, 7. Report; Sir John Davis his Reports, in the Case of Praemunire, etc.
Learned in those Laws; who will give you a clear Declaration of this
Supremacy, and a just Vindication of it, from those impertinent (and seditious)
Objections brought against it by some, who, inslaved to Rome, have cast off
Loyalty to their King, and Love to their Country.

And lastly, As for the Supremacy of Kings, (so far as it concerns the Laws of
God, (Natural or Positive) and Divines to determine it) I refer you to the
Answer^ of the Vid. Literas Acad. Oxon. Hen. 8. Dat. 27. Jul. 1534.
University of Oxon, to a Letter of Henry the Eighth, requiring their Judgment
in that Point: To the Art. Ed. 6. 1552. Art. 36.
Articles of Edward the Sixth; Of Queen Art. 5. Eliz. 1562. Art. 37.

Injunctions of Elizabeth; The Canones, 1603. Can. 1. 2.
Canons of 1. Jacobi; And the Can. 1640. Can. 1. etc.
Canons (sub Carolo Martyr) 1640. (besides the Writings of many particular
Learned Men:) In which you may see the Judgment of the Church of England,
concerning Supremacy, and the Loyalty due to our King, clearly and fully
expressed; and (in the late unhappy Rebellion) more truly professed and
practiced by Her Sons, than Papist, Presbyter, or Fanatique, (though some of
them vainly brag of their Loyalty) can, with any just reason pretend to. If you
desire further satisfaction and evidence, for the Supremacy of Kings,
(particularly of our Kings, and the Roman Emperors) even in Ecclesiastical
Matters; you know, and (at your leisure) may consult, the Collections of our
See our Saxon Laws by Mr. Lambert, Spelman Council. Tom. 7. Whelogus, etc.
Saxon, and the Vid. Cod. Theodosianum, cum Doctiss. Gothofred. Notis, and Cod.
and Novellas Constitut. Justiniani.
Imperial Laws; where you may have sufficient and abundant evidence, that (as
to matter of Fact, never questioned in those days) those Emperors and Kings,
made many Laws and Constitutions, in Ecclesiastical Matters, (which concerned
the Church) as well as Civil, (which concerned the State.) And (if you desire
it) I can show you, an Original MS. ( agreed upon, and approved by the
Convocations of both Provinces, ( Canterbury and York) and subscribed by both
Archbishops, and several of each Province) wherein it is clearly shown, (so far
as Scripture, and other Records of those times mention them) that Kings (from
the beginning of the World, till our Blessed Saviors time) did, and de Jure,
might exercise an Ecclesiastical, as well as Civil Jurisdiction and Supremacy;
especially the Kings of the Jews, his own People; which Monarchy was of Gods
own (and perticularly Divine) Institution. These things premised, I come now to
show you, (in the second place) how dangerous, and (when, and where they have
power to put them in execution) how pernicious Popish Principles are, to the
Persons of Kings, and their just Rights and Prerogatives. And here, I say,

1. That many of their Popish Principles, and generally approved and received
Doctrines, are not only dangerous, but destructive to, and inconsistent with
the just Sovereignty and Supremacy of Kings. Because they generally say, and
(in a thousand Books writ to that purpose) industriously endeavor to prove it,
That all Kings and Emperors, are so far from being Supreme, that they are
Subject to the Pope, as to their Superior Lord, to whom they owe Service and
Fidelity. That this may appear, consider,

1. The Emperor, Casar, ut primum Pontificem videt, illum DETECTO CAPITE, genu
TERRAM TANGENS VENERATUR: and iterum cum appropinquet ad gradus sedis Papae,
genu flect it; ac demum cum ad Pontificis pedes pervener^t, illos DEVOTE
osculatur: Sacrarum Ceremon. Sanctae Romans Ecclesiae, Lib. 1. Tit. 5. page 22.
Col. 3. Edit. onis Romans Anno 1560.
when he comes into the Popes presence, as soon as ever he sees him, he must
(His Hat off, and bare-headed) bow, till his Knee touch the ground, and worship
the Pope; and coming nearer, must bow again; and when he comes to the Pope, he
must how a third time, and DEVOUTLY Kiss the Popes Foot. The Emperor must
WORSHIP the Pope, with the Incurvations, or bowings of Body, even to the
ground; and then (bareheaded, and on his Knees) DEVOUTLY Kiss the Pope's Foot.
Execrable and prodigious Pride! The Pope (without all truth or probability)
vainly and ridiculously, only pretends to be Christ's Vicar, and so, (if it
were true) is less than his Master; and yet our blessed Savior never required,
nor had such Adorations, Incurvations, or Kissings of his Toe, of any, much
less of Kings or Emperors. Nor would any Man require such, but the 2 Thessalonians. 2.
Verse. 3, 4.
Man of Sin; who exalts himself (takes that greatness which God never gave him)
above all that is called God, or worshipped: That is, above all Kings and
Emperors. Well, but does not the Pope (in this Case) show some respect and
civility to the Emperor? Does he not uncover his head, or bow his body, etc.
No; for the same Authentic Book, of the SACRED Ceremonies, of the HOLY Roman
Church, tells us Pontifex Romanus NEMINI omnino mortalium, reverentiam facit,
assurgendo manifest, caput inclinando, aut detegendo. Romano autem Imperatori,
postquam illum SEDENS ad osculum pedis suscepit. ALIQUANTULUM assurgit Magnis
etiam Principibus. PRIVATIM adventantibus, cum NON EST in PONTIFICALIBUS,
aliquantulum assurgit TANQUAM reverentiam faciens, etc. dictus Liber Sacrar.
Ceremon. Lib. 3. Page 113. Col. 2.
.... That the Pope never gives any reverence, to any MORTAL whomsoever, either
by rising up apparently* or by uncovering, or bowing his head. Only (says
that Ceremonial) when the Emperor has kissed the Foot of the Pope, sitting in
his Chair, he rises up, A VERY LITTLE to him; and so he does sometimes to
GREAT PRINCES. Whether this can stand with that Supremacy, which (by Divine
Law, Natural and Positive) is due to Kings, to be so far subject, and slaves to
the Pope; let Kings (who are most concerned) and the World Judge. And it is to
be considered, that the Book I cite for those passages concerning the Pope, is
no Apocryphal, or Non-licenc'd Pamphlet, containing the inventions of some
private person; but it contains the SACRED Ceremonies of the ROMAN CHURCH,
collected by Marcellus ARCHBISHOP of Corcyra, dedicated to POPE LEO the Tenth,
printed at ROME, and highly approved, and Liber VALDE PROBATUS, says Possevin:
In* Apparatu sacro; in Christ. Marcello.
commended by their eminent Writers.

2. But this is not all; the poor Emperor must do (the Pope) his great Superior
and Master, more service, and be his Groom, or (at best) Gentleman He must
execute Stratoris Officium (be Yeoman of the Stirrup) says Card. Baronius.
Annal. Tom. 12. ad An. 1177. Sect. 38.
of his Horse. He must hold the Popes Stirrup till he get on Horseback, and
then lead the Horse for some paces Dicto Sacrarum Caremoniarum, lib. 1. Tit. 5.

..... Caesar (traditis sceptro and pomo* uni ex suis) praevenit ad equum
Pontificis, and TENET STAPHAM, quoad Pontifex equum ascenderit; and deinde
accepto equi fraeno, per aliquot passus ducit equum Pontificis: and the
Emperors have (de facto) executed this mean Office (which was impious and
prodigious pride in the Pope, requiring or permitting; and degenerous in the
Emperors, in performing it:) So the Emperor Tho. Walsingham, Hypodig.
Neustriae, p. 588.
Sigismund held the Stirrup of Pope Martin the Fifth. And the Emperor Baronius
Annal. Tom. 12. ad Annum 1177. Sect. 124.
Frederick, of Alexander the Third, etc. And the same Frederick had done the
same to Pope Adrian the Fourth (if Idem Annal. Tom. 12. ad Annum 1155. number. 13,
14.
Baronius say true)..... In conspectu exercitus sui, Fredericus OFFICIUM
STRATORIS cum JUCUNDITATE implevit, and streguam FORTITER tenuit. And, that it
might be remembered, Baronius has put this Note in the Ibid. number. 13.
Margent..... Ut Reges and Imperatores INSERVIANT. PAPAE. And in the Margent of
the next Paragraph...... Rex implet Ibid. number. 14.
munus STRATORIS Papae.

3. Nor is this all; the Emperor must Swear Fealty to the Pope; and that he
will be his Proctor, to defend and maintain all his Rights and Honors, etc. In
this form Sacrar. Ceremoniarum S. Romans Ecclesiae. lib. 1. Tit. 5. p. 23.
..... Ego Rex Romanorum futurus Imperator, promitto and juro, me de caetero
Protectorem and Procuratorem fore summi Pontificis, in omnibus Necessitatibus
and utilitatibus suis, custodiendo and conservando possessiones, honores, Jura,
etc. Thus Pope Innocent the Third made our King John Swear Fidelity and
Allegiance to him, in this form Hen. de Knighton. de Eventibus Angliae, lib. 2.
p. 2420. and Math. Westmonast. ad Annum 1213. p. 272.
Ego Johannes Rex Angliae..... fidelis ero..... Ecclesiae Romanae ac DOMINO
MEO, Innocentio Papae 3. etc. And before this, Pope Gregory the Seventh (that
Prodigy of wickedness and Papal Tyranny) sends Hubertus to William the
Conqueror, Ut sibi and successoribus FIDELITATEM fac^ret. Baronius Annal. Tom.
11. ad Annum 1079. number. 25.
requiring him to Swear Allegiance and Fidelity to him and his Successors. It Is
true, that the Conqueror had understanding enough to know His Royal Rights, and
the Popes injust pretenses, and so (as well became a King) peremptorily refused
to take any such Oath. Fidelitatem facere nolui (says he in his Letters to the
Pope) neo volo. However, hoc Ithacus vellet; this power they pretended to, and
(as they had ability and opportunity) required it, and (we may be sure) when
they have an advantage and power, they will both require, and severely (by
Interdicts, Anathema's and Excommunications) exact it. And well they might, if
they had that vast Power and Jurisdiction over Kings, which the Canonists,
Jesuits, Schoolmen, Casuists, Summists, and their greatest Writers generally
give them. I shall (of many) give you some few Instances.

after he had said, and (as he thought) proved; That the King was the product
of the Pope and People; by them created and made King; and that the Office of
the Pope and Priest, was the Office of a Father, the King being his Son. He
adds..... That Officium Patris est PRORSUS MAJUS REGIO ET DIVINIUS. And then he
has put these words in the Margent (that they might be taken into special
consideration) SACERDOS in suo munere REGI PRAECIPIT, NON CONTRA. Ibidem p. 26.
col. 1.
.... The Priest COMMANDS THE KING, but the KING CANNOT COMMAND THE PRIEST. The
Priest then is superior, and the King his subject: and so good night to the
Kings Supremacy. And a little before, he says Henricus Rex LUCIFERI SUPERBIAM
imitatur, dum se ipse VICARIUM CHRISTI constituit. Ibid. p. 17. col. 1.
.... Henry the Eighth imitated the PRIDE of LUCIFER, when he made himself VICAR
of Christ. This is pretty well; but as the Pope desires, so the Cardinal (and
others generally) give him more Polus Card. de Concilio. p. 91. Editionis in 8o.
...... Petri Cathedram SUPER OMNIA IMPERATORUM solia, and OMNIA REGUM
tribunalia CONSTITUIT CHRISTUS. The Pope (by their Divinity) is Jure divino,
superior to all Kings and Emperors: And yet St. Paul 2 Cor. 11. 5. and 2 Cor.
12. 11.
( equal to St. Peter, and far above any of his successors) acknowledges that
the Emperor Act. 25. 10, 11.
(and he a Pagan) was his Judge, and legal superior, and (as such) Appeals to
him. Azorius (a great and learned person) confirms the Cardinals Opinion; and
tells us Imperator PAPAE JURE DIVINO SUBJECTUS, ^tiam in TEMPORALIBUS. Azorius
Institut. Moral. Tom. 2. lib. 10. cap. 6. p. 1041.
That the Emperor, BY THE LAW OF GOD, is SUBJECT to the POPE, even IN
TEMPORALS. And since him, a learned Man, and Prior General of his Order, tells
us Unicus DEI VICARIUS PONTIFEX ROMANUS, habet SUMMAM potestatem and IMPERIUM
super OMNES REGES and Principes TERRAE. Blasius Bagnus de S. Romanae Ecclesiae
Dignitatibus. Tract. 7. p. 83.
That the Popes EMPIRE is over ALL THE WORLD (Pagan and Christian) and that HE
is the ONLY VICAR OF GOD, who has SUPREME Power and EMPIRE, over ALL KINGS and
PRINCES OF THE EARTH. And again Ibid. p. 84.
..... Sicut unus est Deus, monarcha omnium; sic inter homines, VNUS DEBET esse
PRINCEPS and MONARCHA, qui OMNIBUS MORTALIBUS praesit and DOMINETUR, DEI
scilicet VICARIUS. Non igitur Petrus SUB REGE, sed REGES SUB PETRO esse DEBENT,
sibique and suis SUCCESSORIBUS INCURVARI, TENENTUR, and COLLA SUBMITTERE. And a
little after Ibid. p. 89.
...... Unus Dei Vicarius OMNIUM PRINCEPS and DOMINUS, Cui IMPERATORES, REGES,
and Potestates OMNES HUMILITER OBEDIANT, sintque SUBJECTI. And good reason they
should be so (if he say true) for Princes have all their Power and Authority
from the Pope....... Sicut luna accipit lumen a sole, sic REGIA potestas
recepit authoritatem, NON ALIUNDE nisi A PAPA. And for the proof of this, he
cites two great Ibid. p. 85.
Lawyers (and might have cited an hundred more) Johannes Andreas, and
Hostiensis... Ad Can. Nemo 13. and Can. Aliorum. 14. Cause. 9. Quaest. 3.

Nay, it is THE DUTY OF ALL KINGS, to suffer the Pope to domineer over them

say it) DE NECESSITATE SALUTIS SUBSUNT ROMANO PONTIFICI. Qui utrumque Luc. 22.
38. 1. It cannot appear that Peter had them both. 2. Nor that they were given
him by Christ.* 3. Nor that they signified two distinct powers. 4. Nor that
Peter might use them both, who was severely condemned for using one, Mat. 26.
51, 52.
gladium habet, and OMNES Judicat, and A NEMINE judicatur. The Pope has both
Swords, that is, (as their Infallible Judge, the Pope, falsely and ridiculously
expounds it) both the Spiritual and Temporal Power, and is SUPREME MONARCH,
above all Kings. Nay further, they blasphemously say, That our Blessed Savior
had not done DISCRETELY, unless he had left such a Supreme Monarch over his
Church at his Ascension to govern the World, Glossa ad dictum Cap. Unam Sanctam.
.... Non videretur Dominus fuisse DISCRETUS, nisi unicum post se talem Vicarium
reliquisset.

And, (to fill up the measure of their Blasphemy against God, and their sordid
and impious flattery of the Pope) Hence it is, that they declare the Pope to be
more than Man,

Glossa verbo Papa ad Prooemium Clementinarum.
Papa stupor mundi....Qui maxima rerum
Nec Deus, nec homo, quasi neuter es inter utrumque.


So the Gloss upon the Clementines, in their Canon Law. And the famous
Inscription (if I forget not) on an Altar at Rome, is as blasphemous (or rather
more) as the former. The words these; Paulo 5o VICEDEO, Pontificiae
OMNIPOTENTIAE vindici acerrimo, etc. where although VICE-DEUS, signify
something less than God; yet Omnipotence blasphemously attributed to the Pope,
must signify, that he was more than Man. But there is another Gloss, which
does not mince the matter, but in plain words, speaks downright blasphemy: in
which it is Glossa ad Cap. Cum inter. 4. verbo, declaramus. De verb. Signif. in
Extravag. Johan. 22.
Dominus DEUS noster Papa. So that these Glosses, though they agree in Impiety,
and are both blasphemous; yet they contradict each other; the one saying, that
the Pope is God; the other, that he is neither God nor Man. Now, if this be
true, I desire some of their Canonists would inform me, what they think the
Pope is. For if (according to their Law) he neither be God nor Man; seeing (I
suppose) it will be granted, that he is a rational Creature, and no good Angel,
he must be (by their Law and Logic) an incarnate Devil. I do not call him so;
but only show, what (by the just consequences of their impious and blasphemous
Glosses) he must be.

5. And here, it may not be unworthy of our observation, that although Thomas
Manrique (Master of the sacred Palace) in the year 1572. thought Censura in
Glossas Juris Canonici. Colon. 1572. p. 13. 14. and 52.
fit to have this impious Gloss left out, and has (in Print) published his
opinion: yet Pope Vide Bullam ejus datam Romae 1. Jul. 1580. praefixam Juri
Canon. Paris. 1612.
Gregory the XIII. thought otherwise, and approves and passes this blasphemous
Gloss (with such others) and so it still remains in the Anno 1580.
Roman and Paris. 161^.
Parisian Editions. Now although the Congregatio Indicis, and their
Inquisitors, in their Indices Expurgatorii, take particular notice of, and Damn
such Sentences as these (though Principles of Christian Religion evidently
contained in Scripture) Index Expurgat. Hispan. Juxta exemplar. Madriti. 1667.
p. 99.
Abraham fide justus. Ibidem, p. 112. Col. 2.
Christus credentibus salus. Ibidem.
Justitia nostra Christus. Omnes Ibidem.
sumus peccatores. I say, though they constantly Damn such Sacred Truths, and
command them to be expunged; yet this impious Gloss (making, as they think, for
the Popes absolute Monarchy) stands untouched, in their last and best Editions
of their Canon Law. Only they have in the last Edition (I have yet seen) added
this Note in the Margent, over against the Gloss Edit. Jur. Canon. Paris. 1612.
Clement. Col. 4. in margin, ad Prooemium Clementinarum.
..... Haec verba sano modo sunt accipienda. And that is (according to the
meaning of Johannes Andreas, the Author of that Gloss) those words must be
taken so, as they make most for the Popes Supremacy: for so it immediately
follows.... Prolata enim sunt ad ostendendam amplissimam esse Pontificis Romani
potestatem.

Now this Supremacy of the Pope being granted, (which their Lawyers, Authentic
Laws, their Canonists and Councils, and all their greatest Writers, Jesuits
especially, generally contend for) it evidently follows, that the Pope is the
sole and only Supreme Power on Earth; and so all Kings and Emperors are, and
must be his Subjects, and so must lose that Supremacy, which (by the Laws of
Nature and Scripture) does de Jure belong to them: For they say, and
industriously endeavor to prove this Absolute Supreme Power and Monarchy of the
Pope, over all Kings and Emperors in the World. I shall, to satisfy you, bring
two or three more Witnesses to prove it.

I. Abraham Abrah. Bzovius de Pontifice Romano. Coloniae Agrip. 1619. says, 1.
Papa est Christianorum Monarcha, cap. 1. 2. Mortalium supremus, cap. 3. 3. A
quo Provocatio nulla, cap. 16. 4. Judex coeli, and in judici^ terreno supremus,
cap. 32. 5. Arbiter Orbis, cap. 45.
Bzovius tells us, 1. That the Pope is MONARCH of ALL CHRISTIANS (Kings and
Emperors included.) 2. That he is SUPREME over ALL MORTALS. 3. That there lies
no APPEAL from him. 4. That he is JUDGE of HEAVEN, and in al^ EARTHLY JUDGMENTS
SUPREME 5. That he is, THE ARBITRATOR of THE WORLD. These (and many more such)
Bzovius industriously endeavors to prove out o^ their Popish Authors. Nor is
his Book an^ surreptitious Work, clandestinely published such as Rome would not
own; for it comes out, with all the Solemn Approbations and Commendations of
his Superiors, and the Apostolic Inquisitor; who thus approves Bzovius his
Book (and so all the abovementioned Extravagant and Antimonarchical Positions)
Vide Approbationes libro Bzovii, De Pontifice Romano praefixus; iu Approbatione
Inquisitoris Apostolici -- Cum de praesentis Operis SINGULARI eruditione,
SOLIDAQUE IN FIDE AC MORIBUS DOCTRINA, tam ex DOCTORUM CALCULO, quam ex
Authoris CELEBRI NOMINE, satis CONSTET, cense^ ut ad COMMUNEM UTILITATEM
excudatur, etc.
-- Seeing it sufficiently appears, by the APPROBATIONS of the DOCTORS, and the
Authors FAMOUS NAME; that the Learning of this present Work is SINGULAR, and
the DOCTRINE SOLID, both IN FAITH and MANNERS; therefore I think it fit to be
published, FOR THE COMMON UTILITY. So that this Doctrine of the Popes
Supremacy, above all Kings and Emperors, is not Bzovius his private Opinion,
but has the Approbation of the Roman Church (at least in the Judgment of those
who approved it) being attested by those, who (by that Church) are empowered
for that purpose.

II. My next Witness is Isiodorus Mosconius (Vicar General to the Archbishop of
Bononia, and a learned Lawyer) who tells us ^ God. Mosconius, de Majestat.
Ecclesiae Militantis, lib. 1. cap. 7. p. 26. Venetiis ^6 ^2. Pontifex Romans est
Judex Universalis, Rex Regum, and Dominus Dominantium, ^o quod eju^ Potestas a
Deo est, and nullum ^abet superiorem nisi Deum: E^que unum Tribunal inter D^^m
and Papam. Ideo omnes alie ^ote^at^s ei s^^ditae sunt, and a nemine judicatur,
nisi a Deo; non ab Augusto, non a Regibus, nec a Clero aut Populo. Et p. 640.
in Margin, Papa est omnium P^^^cipum Monarcha, etc.
-- That the Pope is UNIVERSAL JUDGE, KING OF KINGS, and LORD of LORDS, because
his Power is of God; That GODS TRIBUNAL and the POPES, is one and the SAME, and
that they have the SAME CONSISTORY: and therefore ALL other Powers are HIS
SUBJECTS, and that the Pope is JUDGED of NONE BUT GOD; not of THE EMPEROR or
KINGS, or of the CLERGY or LAITY. And he cites many of their Canons and
Councils, which (as positively as he) say and prove the same thing.

III. Celsus Mancinus (De Juribus Principatuum, Romae 1596. lib. 3. cap. 1, 2.)
is not far short, in attributing an absolute supreme Power to the Pope, even in
Temporal things. For (in the place cited) he tells us Three things (which he
fully proves, out of their best Authors.) Mancinus loco citato, ait. 1. Papa
est TOTIUS ORBIS DOMINUS. 2. PAPA (ut Papa) habet POTESTATEM TEMPORALEM. 3.
Potestas Papae temporalis, est OMNIUM aliarum Potestatum EMINENTISSIMA,
aliaeque potestates OMNES ab illo DEPENDENT.
1. That the Pope is LORD OF THE WHOLE WORLD. 2. That the Pope (as Pope) has
TEMPORAL POWER. 3. That this temporal power of the Pope, is, of ALL OTHER
POWERS in the World most EMINENT; and ALL other Powers DEPEND on the POPE. But
let this pass; I shall cite you a greater Authority which will not only tell
you, that the Papal Power is greater than Regal and Imperial, but how much it
is greater: for,

IV. Pope Innocent the III. (as Infallible as any of his Successors) tells us,
that the Papal Innocentius 3. cap. Solicitae, 6. Extra de Major. and Obedientia.
Power, is as much greater than the Imperial, as the SUN is greater than the
MOON. And the Gloss there Pontificalis dignitas quadragies Septies Regali
major^ So the learned Gloss.
says, that is 47 times greater. He who put the Note in the Margent there,
thinks this too little; and therefore he says, Quinquagies septies; The Papal
Power is (according to his Arithmetic) 57 times greater than the Imperial. A
Man would think, that (by these accounts) the Popes Power were great enough.
But there is an Addition there, (who was the Author of it, I know not) in which
we are told, (you may believe so far as you think sit) that the Papal Dignity
exceeds the Imperial, no less than 7744. so inconsiderable a thing (in these
Men's account) is Regal and Imperial Majesty, in respect of the vast Greatness
of Papal Supremacy.

In short; If you compare that Decretal of Innocent the Third (but now cited)
with that famous Extravagant of Pope Bonifacius 8. cap. Unam Sanctam. 1. de
majoritate and Obed. Extrav. Com.
Boniface the Eighth, (both which are received into the Body of their
Canon Law) you will find them cite several places of Scripture, (miserably
misunderstood) and bring reasons to prove the Papal Power above the Regal and
Imperial. But the consequences they draw from those Texts they cite, are so far
from being Infallible, that they are (like those who cite them) evidently
false; and what other Arguments they bring, are not only unlike reason, but
ridiculous: yet although neither the Reasons, nor the Authority of their Popes,
nor the general consent of the ablest Writers Rome has, (who all endeavor to
establish the same Position, and the Popes extravagant Supremacy) can prove
that he really has such Power, (nor are they cited by me to any such purpose)
yet they clearly prove that they own that Doctrine (which is all I aim at) and
(though they cannot) gladly would make it appear probable, and have us and all
others to believe it.

6. And further, from this unlimited Supremacy of the Pope, they conclude (and
publicly profess) his power to depose Kings, absolve their Subjects from all
Oaths of Allegiance, and dispose of their Kingdoms. That this may appear, I
consider,

1. That to cite particular Popish Writers, would be endless, and needless;
that Bellarmine, Emanuel Sa, Suares, Mariana, Turrecremata, etc. that the
Canonists, Casuists, Schoolmen, Summists, Jesuits, etc. are generally (if not
universally) of this opinion, ( That the Pope may depose Kings, etc.) is
notoriously known to all, who know them. I shall only instance in two or three
(to give you a taste of that impious doctrine, which all of them profess,
assert, and (so far as they are able) vindicate, etc.) And here, 1. Celsus
Mancinus (a learned Canon-Regular of the Order of St. Augustine) tells us, that
Conspicuum est OMNIBUS, a Summo Pontifice DEPONI PRIVARI que Imperatores, idque
non TANTUM ratione eorum quae ad FIDEM spectant, verum etiam and eorum quae ad
MORES and JUS CIVIL spectant. Celsus Mancinus De Juribus Principatuum, lib. 3.
cap. 3. page 76. Romae 1596.
-- It is EVIDENT TO ALL, THAT EMPERORS ARE DEPOSED and DEPRIVED by the Pope,
and that not ONLY FOR things pertaining TO FAITH, but ALSO for things
pertaining to MANNERS and the CIVIL LAW. And Abraham Bzovius (more fully)
says, (as generally the rest do) 1. Bzovius De Pont. Romano, cap. 46. p. 621.
col. 2. Col. Agrip. 1618. 1. Potestas secularis subdita est spirituali, ita ut
non sit indicium usurpatum, si potestas spiritualis de temporalibus judicet. 2.
Papa sammam habet potestatem etiam in Reges and Principes Christianos, qui eos
corrigat, officio amoveat, and in loco eorum alios constituat. 3. Papa potest
Regem propter Haeresin, Schisma, crimen intolerabile in populo, negligentiam
aut socordi^m, si juramento dato, in rebus gravissimis non satisfecerit, a^t
Ecclesiam opprimeret, DIGNITATE REGIA EXUERE.
That the secular power IS SUBJECT to the SPIRITUAL; so that it is no
usurpation, if the Spiritual JUDGE the Secular. 2. The Pope has SUPREME POWER
over Christian KINGS and PRINCES, who may CORRECT, DEPOSE, and PUT OTHERS in
their PLACES. 3. The Pope may DEPRIVE a KING of his Royal Dignity for HERESY,
SCHISM, for any intolerable crime, negligence, or laziness, if in great matters
he break his Oath, or oppress the Church, etc. So that in all these cases (by
him there mentioned, and they are Eight or Nine) the Pope may depose a Supreme
Prince; and the Pope himself is SOLE JUDGE both of the CRIME and Condemnation.
And to make all this good, 1. he gives us a Bzovius loco citato, page 611, 612,
etc.
Catalogue of above Thirty Kings and Princes, who have ( de facto) been
Deposed, or (by Excommunications and Anathema's) Damned by the Pope. 2. And
then he cites the Canon of a Ibid. page 619, 620, 621.
General Council of their own, (of which anon) and above an hundred eminent
Authors of their own Church, who assert and justify that Impious Opinion. 3.
And then he further adds, that AN INNUMERABLE company of ENGLISH MARTYRS
(following their Captain Edmund Campian, a Villain Condemned and Executed for
Campian justly executed for High Treason, 24 of Eliz. 1581. Vide Camden's
Elizab. Lib. 3. page 239, 240.
High Treason) did with their Pens and Blood maintain the same Opinion. --
INNUMERABILES etiam Anglicani MARTYRS DUCEM Edmundum CAMPIANUM secuti, pro
PRIMATU Roniani Pontificis, ab Hen. 8. and Elizabetha caesi, Sanguine profuso,
and stilo exerto idem do^uerunt. So that we may see, the Doctrine of the Pope's
Power to DEPOSE KINGS, must be de Fide, an Article of Divine Truth, and They
Martyrs who die in defense of it: for Campian is with them, a MARTYR CHRISTI
INCLYTUS, and sui seculi CLARISSLMUS. Pet. Ribaden^ira in Catalog. Scriptorum,
Religionis Societatis Jesu, in Edmundo Gampiano. Parsons the sesuit says as
much for Garnet, in his Discussion of the Answer of W. B. page 22, 23.
Most FAMOUS MARTYR.

These Positions, asserted publicly and in Print, by Popish Authors, with so
much confidence, and without any check of the Romish Church, of which they are
Members; may justly seem impious and horrid to any sober Christian, who wishes
well (as all good Subjects should) to Kings and Monarchy: yet I shall show you
greater Abominations. One of their Casp. Sci^ppi^s, in his Ecclesiasticum
J^cobo Magnae Britanniae Regi Oppositum, cap. 139. page 502. Edit. 1611.
Authors, writing against King James, (of happy Memory) tells us,

1. That the Pope's Power ( in the BELIEF of CATHOLICS) is not barely
Ministerial, but IMPERIAL. CATHOLICI (says he) non tantum MINISTERIO, sed and
IMPERIO Papam praesidere CREDUNT. And this Papal Power is Penes Papam in
Ecclesia SUMMUM IMPERIUM, Potestas SUMMA, tam dirigendi quam COGENDI, jus etiam
VITAE and NECIS in Papa resid^t. Ibidem cap. 138. page 426.
SUPREME, so that there resides in the Pope a night to direct and COMPEL, and a
POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH. And to show the reason of this, he adds; Papa est
SUMMUS DEI VICARIUS, Caesar summus Ecclesiae ADVOCATUS; quo NIHIL ULLI REGI
amplius aut HONORIFICENTIUS. Papa CAPUT est Corporis Christi. Caesar ^c REGES
sunt BRACHIA seu MANUS. Itaque insania est dicere nullum Capitis in Brachia
Imperium esse. Papa (qui est Caput and vertex Ecclesiastici corporis) Spiritus
Sancti inspiratione regitur. BRACHIA NIHIL facere possunt, nisi quod ad
corporis Victum, amictum ac protectionem pertinet; quorum omnium Regimen ac
praescriptum, quin penes Caput sit, and inde ad Brachia derivetur, Dubitare
Paulus vetat, Col. 2. 19. Itaque si Reges non nutriant, neque vestiant Corpus.
-- Si Brachia aut Manus munere non fungantur, nec teneant Caput. -- Ut membrum
inutile. CAPITIS IMPERIO AMPUTENTUR. Ibid. cap. 241. page 511. If you desire to
see more of the Pope's Deposing King's, Card. Baronius (in an hundred places)
vindicates the Power, and approves and commends the practice. See his Annals,
Ad annum 593. number. 8. and ad Annum 730. number. 5.
That the POPE is the SUPREME VICAR of GOD, the Emperor Supreme ADVOCATE of the
Church, than which NOTHING can be more HONORABLE for any KING: (Surely Kings
are much bound to him for that Honorable Office.) The POPE (as he goes on) is
THE HEAD of Christ's Body; The Emperor and Kings are ARMS and HANDS; And
therefore it is MADNESS to say, That the HEAD has not EMPIRE over the ARMS. The
POPE, who is the Head and Top of the Ecclesiastical Body, is governed by the
INSPIRATION of the Holy Ghost. The ARMS can do nothing, but what pertains to
the Food, Raiment, and Protection of the Body. And St. Paul forbids us to
doubt, that the Government and Prescription of all these, belongs to the Head,
and from thence is derived to the ARMS. And therefore if Kings do not feed and
cloth the Body, if the ARMS or HANDS do not do their Office, they may (by the
Command of the HEAD) be CUT OFF, as unprofitable Members. These are his words,
or the English of them.

So that (by this Popish Doctrine) the Pope, being Head of the Body, may, when
he pleases, (for he is Supreme and Sole Judge in the case) cut off Kings and
Emperors, who are but the Hands or Arms of that Body. And yet so hard is the
Forehead of that Author, that he is not ashamed to say, (and put it in the
Margent, that all might take notice of it) That this great Power of the Pope,
is Summa Papae potestas NIHIL PRORSUS PERICULI ADFERY REGIBUS. Idem cap. 141.
page 512.
NOT AT ALL dangerous or prejudicial to Princes. How dangerous this Doctrine of
this Papal Supremacy, has been to Princes, the many Excommunications and
Depositions of Kings and Emperors, in the six last Centuries, are evident and
sad Witnesses; and what mischief (if not carefully prevented) it may do for the
future, it will concern Princes, and all who are Loyal, and love Them, and
their own Preservation, seriously to consider. It was a Wise Man's saying, That
Protestant Princes may be too secure, but never safe, while any Jesuit dwells
in their Dominions. Thuanus speaking of the fatal, and (by them, too secure)
not feared Tragedy of Hen. 3. and 4. of France, he seems to blame their too
great Security, and then adds: MISEROS PRINCIPES, QUIBUS DE CONJURATIONE NON
CREDI^UR, NISI OCCISIS. But to proceed.

2. Another of their Authors, and he a Learned Bishop ( Jacobus Jacobus.
Simanca. Enchir. Judicum Tit. 67. Sect. 12. p. 349. Antwerp. 1573 HAERETICI
PRIVATI SUNT OMNI DOMINIO and Jurisdictione, and EORUM SUBDITI ab eis LIBERI
sunt, quod and REGES, and alios rerum Dominos comprehendit.
Simanca by Name) tells us that, which concerns all Protestant Princes to
consider, and what they must expect from the Pope; when he has Power to put
their Traitorous Principles in execution. The thing he tells us, is this:
Heretics (says he, and we know who are meant by that hard word) are actually
DEPRIVED OF ALL DOMINION and JURISDICTION, and their SUBJECTS FREED FROM THEIR
OBEDIENCE: and this comprehends KINGS and OTHER LORDS. So Simanca. Nor is this
his private or singular Opinion: For, 1. He proves it expressly out of a
Decretal of Pope Gregory the Ninth, extant in the Body of their Cap. Absolutos.
16. Extra* de Haereticus.
Canon Law. 2. He cites Alph. a Castro, de Justa Haereticor. Punit. Lib. 2.
Cap. 7. etc.
Alphonsus a Castro, who also proves the Position of Simanca, by evident
Testimonies of many and eminent Popish Authors. 3. It is to be considered too,
that Simanca's Book is Priviledg'd, and Licensed to be Printed by Public
Authority, and with the Approbation and high Commendation of the Censor
Librorum, the Learned Ben. Arias Montanus; who tells us, that he had read it,
Valde utilem esse censeo ad TOTIUS argumenti suscepti cognitionem and PRAXIM,
NIHIL QUE continere quod CATHOLICAM FIDEM offendat: Ideoque DIGNUM judico, ut
ad MULTORUM UTILITATEM, TERTIO, and etiam SAEPIUS edatur: So are the words in
Arias Montanus his License of that Book.
and judged it HIGHLY PROFITABLE, for the Knowledge and PRACTICE of the WHOLE
Argument undertaken, and that it contained NOTHING OFFENSIVE to the CATHOLIC
FAITH, (then, in that great Man's Judgment, that Rebellious Roman Doctrine, of
Deposing Heretical Kings, and Absolving their Subjects from all Oaths of
Allegiance, is not offensive to their Catholic Faith.) And therefore I JUDGE
it WORTHY, that FOR THE PROFIT OF MANY, it be A THIRD TIME, and OFTENER,
Published. So that this Doctrine, (That Heretical Kings are Deprived of all
their Dominion, and their Subjects Absolved from all Oaths of Allegiance) is
not only approved by Simanca, Alfonsus a Castro, Arias Montanus, (all great and
very learned Persons in the Church of Rome) but by their Canon Law, and the
Decretal of Pope Gregory the Ninth. And it is further considerable, that this
Doctrine (though Impious and Traiterous) is not (in any Index Expurgatorius, I
have yet seen) condemned either in Simanca, or any other of all those, who
generally assert and vindicate it.

3. One more I shall only cite, (though an hundred such might be cited) and he
a famous Jesuit, who plainly tells us, (what their Society constantly profess,
and many of them have, and do practice) Clerici rebellio in Regem, non est
crimen laesae Majestatis, quia Clericus non est Regisubditus. Eman. Sa. Aphor.
Confess. Verbo Clericus, page 41. Col. 1599.
That if a CLERGYMAN Rebel against his KING, it is NO TREASON, because
CLERGYMEN are not the KINGS SUBJECTS. Nor is this the singular Opinion of
Emanuel Sa; for it is approved, and highly commended, (by their Censores
Librorum) both at the Opus Theologis, OMNIBUSQUE animarum curam habentibus
UTILE ac NECESSARIUM.
beginning, and Hi Aphorismi DOCTI sunt ac PII, MULTAMQUE Utilitatem allaturi.
end of that Book; and (as an Jac. Leschassier operum page 421. Edit. Paris
1652.
excellent and learned Person tells me) it was highly approved and commended at
Rome too. So that (if such a multitude of eminent Popish Authors may have that
credit they deserve in this particular) we may be sure, that this impious and
traiterous Doctrine is approved and received in the Church of Rome. And though
I said I would cite no more such Testimonies, to manifest so certain and clear
a Truth; yet I shall add two more, (not unworthy your Consideration) which are
(if that be possible) more highly impious than the former.

1. Then, a great Popish Phil, Maynardus de Privilegiis Ecclesiast. Dedicated
to Pope Paulus 5. and printed at Ancona. 1607.
Lawyer, (in asserting the Papal Power) has, and endeavors to prove these
erroneous and desperate Positions.

1. The Emperor and Kings are the Popes Subjects. (1) Imperator subest Papae
ut and Reges. Art. 5. Sect. 19. 21.
2. The Emperor and Kings may be Deposed by the Pope, for Heresy and any
great Sin. (2) Imperator and Rex ratione fidei and peccati gravis, possunt a
Papa deponi and privari, Ibid. Sect. 23.
3. The Pope has Power in the whole World, in Spirituals and TEMPORALS; and
this TEMPORAL Power he has in a more Worthy, a Superior and perfect manner,
than Secular Princes. (3) Papa habet potestatem in toto Orb, in Spiritualibus
and Temporalibus; and in Temporalibus modo digniori, superiori, and perfectiori
quam habent Principes seculares. Ibid. Art. 6. Sect. 1. and Sect. 11.
4. Statutes made by Laymen, do not bind the Clergy. (4) Statuta Laicorum non
obligant Clericos. Art. 13. Sect. 9.
5. The Pope is Vicar of God, and preferred before all Powers, as GOD HIMSELF;
and EVERY CREATURE IS SUBJECT TO HIM. (5) Vicarius Dei Omnibus Potestatibus
Praeponitur, SICUT IPSE DEUS, and PAPAE SUBEST OMNIS CREATURA, Ibid. Art. 6.
Sect. 11. 12.
6. It is necessary to Salvation to be Subject to the Pope, and he who affirms
the contrary, IS NO CHRISTIAN. (6) Papae subesse, est DE NECESSITATE SALUTIS,
and contrarium asserens, NON POTEST DICI CHRISTIANUS. Ibidem Sect. 13.

This he has out of the Cap. Unam Sanct. De Major, and Obedientia. Inter.
Extrav. Communes.
Canon Law, and the Decretal of Pope Boniface the Eighth. So that by this
impious and uncharitable Doctrine, all Protestant Kings, Princes and People,
are denied to be Christians, and absolutely damned, without all hope or
possibility of Salvation. And yet their Vide Glossam ad dictum Cap. unam

of their Catholic Faith; for my part, I can have no great Opinion of their
Faith, who have little Charity, and damn all save themselves.

2 Once more, Stanislaus Orichovius in Chimaera, page 99.
Stanislaus Orichovius, (while he magnifies the Pope and his Papal Greatness,
with high contempt of Kings, and Blasphemy against God) has this passage,
unfit to fall from the Pen of any sober Christian, Sacerdos praestat Regi,
Quantum HOMO praestat BESTIAE. Qui Regem praefert Sacerdoti, is CREATURAM
aneponit creatori. loco citato.
The PRIEST (says he) excels THE KING, as much as a MAN excels a BEAST. And
says further, HE WHO PREFERS THE KING BEFORE THE PRIEST, he prefers the
CREATURE before the CREATOR. This is strange Doctrine, and yet approved at
Rome, at least nor condemned there (as Antimonarchical Positions, which decry
Royal, and magnify Papal Power, seldom, or never are) the reason why I say and
believe this, is; Because I find in the Index Expurgatorius Hispan. in
Stanislao Orichovio.
Spanish Expurgatory Index, some other things of this Author censured; but this
passage now cited, is neither meddled with, nor once mentioned.

But to pass by particular Testimonies of single Popish Authors, (who publicly
assert, and industriously endeavor to Vindicate this Rebellious Doctrine, That
Kings may be deposed and murdered by the Pope or People.) I shall give you
greater, and (to the Church of Rome) more Athentique Authority. As for instance,

1. Their Decretum Gratiani EMENDATUM, jussu Gregorii. 13. Editum, juxta
Exemplar ROMANUM, DILIGENTER RECOGNITUM. Paris. 1612.
Canon Law, approved, received, used and obeyed in their Church, as a Rule of
Justice in all their Courts and Consistories. I shall quote their best Edition;
Corrected, Approved, and Published by the Popes Command, (and he Infallible no
doubt) for so he himself tells us....... Gregorius Papa. 13. in Bulla Corpori
Juris Canonici praesixa. Dat. Romae. 1580. Anno Pontificatus sui. 9,
Nos providere volentes, ut hoc Jus Canonicum, sic EXPURGATUM, ad OMNES CHRISTI
FIDELES SARTUM perveniat, ac ne cuiquam liceat operi QUICQUAM ADDERE, vel
IMMUTARE, aut INVERTERE, sed prout in urbe nostra Roma nuper impressum fuit,
perpetuo integrum and INCORRUPTUM conservetur. Now in his Canon Law, so purged
and corrected, that it might come to ALL THE FAITHFUL, (as the Pope himself
tells us, who, if he were Infallible, could not, and if he were but an Honest
Man, would not publish an Untruth) we are told,

I. That the Pope may depose Princes, and then absolve their Subjects from
their Oaths of Allegiance, Vid. Can. Authoritatem. 2. Cause. 15. Quaest. 6.
Part. 2.
..... A FIDELITATIS etiam JURAMENTO, Romanu Pontifex nonnullos ABSOLVIT, cum
aliquos A SUA DIGNITATE DEPONIT. And having set down this for Law, it
immediately follows,

II. That Alius autem Romans Pontifex, Zacharias scilicet, Regem Francorum, non
tam pro sui^ Iniquitatibus; quam pro eo, quod tantae potestati erat inutilis a
REGNO DEPOSUIT, omnesque Francigenos a JURAMENTO FIDELITATIS. quod illi
fecerunt, ABSOLVIT. Quod etiam ex AUTHORITATE FREQUENTI facit Ecclesia. Ibid.
Can. Alius 3.
another Pope (Zachary by Name) deposed the King of France; not so much for HIS
INIQUITIES, but that he was UNPROFITABLE for such a Power.....And then he
ABSOLVED ALL THE FRENCH from their Oath of FIDELITY: And then adds,..... That
the Holy-Church (he means the Pope) does (by an usual Authority) so absolve
Subjects from their Oaths to their Superiors.

Now concerning this memorable Canon, give me leave to observe,

1. That the Gloss tells us, ( John Semeca, a famous Canonist, was Author of
it) that Pope Gelasius maintained the Doctrine of deposing Emperors; Glossa ad
dictum Canonem. verbo Alius.
..... Gelasius Papa scribens contra Anastasium Imperatorem, dicit, QUOD POTEST
EUM DEPONERE PROPTER malitiam suam, etc.

2. In the Lemma, or Title of this Canon, (in the Edit. Paris. 1519, etc.
old Editions of the Canon Law) it was,..... Gelasius Papa Anastasio
Imperatori. But in later Edit. Lugduni. 1661. etc
Editions the Title is this,..... Pontificalis Authoritas A JURAMENTO
FIDELITATIS nonnullos ABSOLVIT, unde Gregorius Papa. The Vid. Notam ad dictum
Can. Alius; in Edit. recentioribus.
Annotator tells us truly, that Gelasius could not speak of the French Kings
deposition; seeing Gelasius was dead, above 240 years before Chilpericus (or
Childericus, they write him both ways) came to be King of France. But they say,
the words of this Canon are found in the Gregorius. 7. Regist. lib. 8. Epist.
21.
Epistles of Pope Gregory the Seventh, and therefore they do rightly refer them
to him, as the true Author of them. Now, whether it were Gelasius or Gregory
the Seventh, it is all one, (as to my present business) it is by them
confessed, that a Pope was Author of that Rebellious passage, Gratian refers it
into the Body of their Canon Law, and Pope Vide Bullam Gregorii. 13. Dat.
Romae. 1. Julii. 1580. Corpori Jur. Can. praefixam.
Gregory the Thirteenth approves, and (together with the whole Body of the Law,
the Gloss and Annotations) confirms and ratifies it. Whence we may rationally
conclude, that this Doctrine of the Popes Power to depose Kings, and absolve
their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance (though impious and rebellious)
is so far from being disowned, or detested by all Papists (as some now pretend)
that the Supreme power of that Church has not only approved, but established it
for Law. By the way; though you see, that Gratian and Pope Gregory say, that
Pope Zachary was the Man who deposed the French King Hildericus; yet Eginhardus
in Vita Caroli Magni, p. 4, 5. Edit. Colon. 1521. who says -- Hildericus Rex,
JUSSU STEPHANI, Romani Pontificis, depositus est. This impious Fact of Pope
Stephen, has been approved, and (in practice) Imitated by many of his
followers. Bzovius (before cited) gives us a List of above 30 Kings and
Princes, thus deposed by Popes, and Anathematized.
an Historian of more Antiquity and Credit than either of them (notwithstanding
Gregory's Infallibility) tells us, that it was Pope Stephen (Zacharies
Successor) who deposed him. So that all agree, that A Pope (it matters not
which) was Author of that impiety.

3. When the Canon says, that the French King was deposed by the Pope, because
he was INUTILIS, etc. the Gloss gives you the meaning of that word;...... Non
intelligas, INUTILS, id est INSUFFICIENS, tunc enim ei dari debuit Coadjutor;
sed quia DISSOLUTUS erat, cum Ipse Papa Pater Patrum putativus, sed filiorum
VERUS Pater: quod, qui Nopotes ejus, omnes norunt. Il. Nepotismo, page --
MULIERIBUS, and EFFOEMINATUS; so that (by this Papal Law) we see, that (if the
Pope please) the greatest Prince may be deposed for a very small matter.

4. When this Canon says; the Pope deposed the King of France; the Glossa ad
dictum. Can Alius. 3. Verbo, deposuit.
Gloss notes..... Ergo Papa deponit Imperatorem. And (least we should not take
notice of it) these words (in their best Editions of the Canon-Laws Cum bis

corrected, purged, revised, and whatever wicked men had put into the Text or
Margent, contrary to the Catholic Faith, by Pope Gregory's command expunged) I
say (notwithstanding all this) these words are put in the Margent.......
IMPERATOR POTEST A PAPA DEPONI. Whence it is evident, that in Pope Gregory's
Opinion, this impious Doctrine and Position (though contrary to the true
Christian) is not contrary to THEIR ROMAN FAITH; being expressly in those
Glosses and Canons; in which, their Supreme and Infallible Judge says, There is
NOTHING CATHOLICAE VERITATI CONTRARIUM. Nor is this Pope Gregory's singular
opinion; that the Pope may depose Kings. For seeing it has been approved by
their Popes, and their General Councils, (as you shall see anon) and for some
Ages received amongst their Sacred Canons, (as they call them) it is become a
necessary part of their Creed, (and no Salvation without the belief of it) to
which all their Secular Clergy, Archbishops, Bishops, and whoever has any cure
of Souls; and all their Regulars (at least the Heads and Governors of them) are
solemnly One Article of the Trent-Creed is this... Item OMNIA a Sacris

sworn. For they swear, promise, and vow, without all doubtings, to receive,
and profess ALL THINGS defined and declared in the SACRED CANONS, and General
Councils; and (so far as they are able) to make others receive them too. So
that all their Ecclesiastiques (especially all who have any Cure of Souls) do
not only believe this impious Doctrine of Popes Power to depose Kings, but they
swear, both to BELIEVE and PROFESS IT, and (as far as they are able) make
others do so too. How pernicious to Kings and Princes, such Principles, and
such Persons, (sworn to Profess and Promote them) heretofore have been, the
many sad and Tragical Examples of deposed Princes, in the six last Centuries,
can abundantly witness, and assure us: And how pernicious (for the future) they
may be, unless (with care and prudence) they be prevented, we, or our
Posterity, may unhappily, and too soon see. Dirum omen misericors, qui solus
potest, averruncet Deus.

Commentary on the Canon beforecited, affirms, and endeavors to prove these

Propositions.

I. The Pope may DEPOSE the Emperor, or a King I. Papa potest deponere

from their Oath of Allegiance. III. The Pope may depose Counts, Dukes, and
other III. Papa potest deponere Comites, Duces and alios Barons, sine consensu
Imperatorum, aut Regum quibus subsunt.
Barons, without the Consent of the Emperor, or those Kings, whose Subjects

they are sure to have (if it make for his interest) may depose their Kings.
This he farther proves, and adds..... That if the King be a manifest Heretic
(as all Protestants are with them) then THE CHURCH may depose him.
The Premises considered, it will highly concern all Protestant Kings and
Princes to look to it, who, (as Heretics) are all damned, and Vid. Bullam
dictam a Clemente X. Editam, An 1671. 7. Call. April. and Pontif. sui An. 1. in
Bullario Romans Lugduni 1673. p. 528. Sect. 1.
Anathematized once every year, on Maundy-Thursday, in their Bulla Coenae
Domini. For, had they of Rome power to act according to their Principles,
Pretenses, and Interest, they would make short work, a speedy and thorough
Reformation; and compel all Protestant (or, as they constantly miscall them,
Heretical) Kings and Princes, to quit their Religion, or their Realms and
Kingdoms.

Be it concluded then; that (according to the Approved and Received Doctrine of
the Roman Church) Kings and Princes may be deposed, and their subjects absolved
from their Oaths of Allegiance. And for the truth of what I here say; we have
the Precept and Practice of three Popes ( Zachary, Gregory the Seventh, and
Urban the Second) and three Vide Gratian. Can. Alius. 3. Can. Nos Sanctorum. 4.
and Can. Juratos. 5. Cause. 15. Quaest. 6.
Canons grounded on that Papal Authority, received into the Body of their
Canon Law: which, when you have occasion, you may (for further satisfaction)
consult.

Now if you inquire, for what Crimes Kings may be deposed by the Pope; whether
for Heresy only (for that is universally agreed on) or for other Crimes also?
John Semeca (Author of the Gloss on Gratian) gives us a full and Categorical
Answer. For, 1. He Glossa ad Can. si Papa 6. Did. 40. Verbo. A ^ide devius.
proposes the Question: Pro quo peccato potest Imperator deponi? For what Sin
can the Emperor be deposed? (That he may be deposed, is (in that Law) no
Question, but an undoubted truth; the Question only is, for what Crimes it may
be done.) And the Answer is.......... PRO QUOLIBET peccato potest Imperator
deponi, si sit incorrigibilis. Ibidem.
That he may be deposed for ANY SIN, if he be INCORRIGIBLE; and not only for
his sins, but if he Papa Zacharias Regem Francorum, non tam pro suis
iniquitatibus, quam quod tantae potestatis erat INUTILIS. deposuit. Can. Alius.
2. Cause. 15. Quaest. 6.
UNPROFITABLY manage that Regal Power: And this he proves out of another Canon.
This is the sad condition of Kings and Emperors (by the Popish Canon Law) they
may be deposed (if they be incorrigible) for ANY SIN, and sometimes for no sin;
at least as the principal cause of their deposition. Whereas (by the same Law)
if the Pope be so Dicto Can. si Papa. 6 Did. 40.
prodigiously impious, that he not only damn himself, but carry [
INNUMERABILES POPULOS] innumerable people to hell with him, yet there is no
deposing, or Judging him. This not only the Canon in Gratian, but a long
Annotation (lately added, since Gratians time) approves, and confirms: and
Pope Gregory the Thirteenth approves both the Canon, and Annotation, in his
Bulla Gregorii. 13. Corp. Jur. Can. praesixa.
Bull, I have so often mentioned. So that (according to this Law) If the
Emperor, or any King, will not be good Boys, and obey their Grand Master (
Dominum DEUM NOSTRUM, as they call him) the Pope; if they will not be corrected
by him, and amend what he thinks amiss (for he is Supreme and Sole Judge of the
Crime and Punishment) Then the Pope may, and (if he have ability and
opportunity, we may be sure) he will depose them.

Thus much (and may be too much) for the Canon Law; that Sink of Forgeries,
Impiety, and Disloyalty. For I scarce know any Book, wherein are more forged
Writings (under good names sometimes) for bad purposes; or more Impious
Doctrines and Positions owned and authorized for Law, and that by one who
pretends (though without, and against all reason) to be Christ's Vicar, and
Infallible; or any Book which has more Seditious and Rebellious Principles of
Disloyalty. This I only say now, but when I have (what now I want) time, and
opportunity; I can, and ((...)) will make it good. How dangerous, and (when
believed and practiced) how pernicious to Kings and Princes, the Principles of
that Law are, you may (in part) see by the premises: if you desire more, you
may (at your leisure) consult, and consider those Places here mentioned in the

with the Gloss and Case upon them; together with Cardinal Turrecremata's
Commentary on Gratians Decree, and Panormitan on the Decretals (to omit all
other Canonists) you will find Evidence, more than enough, to convince you, out
of their own Testimonies, that the Principles of their own Law, as explained by
their greatest, and best Interpreters, are not only Dangerous, but Destructive
of the Right of Kings, and inconsistent with that Loyalty, which (by the Laws
of Nature and Scripture) are really due to them.

3. But besides these Testimonies of particular Writers of their own Church,
and their Approved, and (by Puplick Authority) Established, and Received
Canon Law, we have greater and more Authentic Testimonies, that in the Popish
Church, they both profess and practice this impious and rebellious doctrine, of
Anathematizing, and Deposing Kings and Emperors, of giving away their Kingdoms
to others, and Absolving their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance and
Fidelity. For their Popes (who are their Supreme and Infallible Judges)
testify as much, in their Breves and Bulls; and those not forged, or corrupted
by Heretics; but Published by themselves, and Printed at Rome, in their own

1. The Bull of Pius the Fifth against Queen Elizabeth. The Title prefixed to
that impious Bull, is this: Dicti Bullarii. Tom. 2. p. 229. and in the Edition

DAMNATIO, and Excommunicatio Elizabethae, Reginae Angliae, eique ADHAERENTIUM,
Where (in one breath and Bull) he Damns that Innocent Queen, and all her Loyal
Subjects, ( Protestants and Papists.) Where (by the way) it is to be
considered, That if any Papists be Loyal, (as by the Law of God and Nature they
ought) to any Heretical King or Prince, (and at Rome, our Gracious King, and
all Protestants are such) it is reputed their Crime, and they Damned at Rome
for it. For it is not only ( OMNES Vide Bullam Clementis 10 dat. Romae. 7. Call.

Heretics, of what sort soever, but also all those, who RECEIVE, FAVOR, or
DEFEND them. So that if any Roman Catholic Favor, or (according to his
Natural, or Sworn Allegiance) Defend his Prince, who is a Protestant, (and so a
Declared Heretic) he is under the same Anathema and Condemnation. And this
Anathema and Condemnation of all Heretics, and all those who Favor or Defend
them, is solemnly renewed every In Bulla Coenae Domini.

Canon Law.

But to proceed: In this Bull of Pope Pius the Fifth, which contains the
Anathema and Damnation (as it is called in the Lemma prefixed to that Bull) of
Queen Elizabeth; which proved BRUTUM FULMEN, (the good and most gracious GOD
blessing what the Pope impiously cursed) we have these Particulars very
considerable.

1. The extravagant Power the Pope assumes; when he tells us, That our Blessed
Savior did constitute Peter, and by consequence Christus -- QUI NOS in hoc
SUPREMO JUSTITIAE THRONO voluit collocare. Dictae Bullae. Sect. 3.
Him, (as St Peter's Successor.)....... SUPER OMNES GENTES, and OMNIA Regna

of God to Jer. 1. 10.

by this Pope and By Innocent 3, and yet it goes for Law. Cap: Solicitae, 6.

his Predecessors. Here is a pretense to a vast and destructive Power; and
though it be a bare pretense, and (without any just ground) irrational and
ridiculous; yet let Princes look to it. For when the Popes had Power, they did;
and when they have, they will make use of it.

2. This premised, he proceeds to his Damnatory Sentence, in these words: Nos
Apostolicae potestatis plenitudine declaramus praedictam Elizabetham
Haereticam, eique adhaerentes, Anathematis sententiam tincurrisse, esseque A
CHRISTI CORPORIS UNITATE PRAECISOS. Dictae Bullae Sect. 3.
We (says he) by the Plenitude of Apostolical Power, declare the said
Elizabeth an Heretic, and both her, and her Adherents, to have incurred the
Sentence of Excommunication, and to be all cut off from the Unity of the Body
of Christ. But this is not all; He proceeds (very unlike a Christian, and what
he would be thought, Christ's Vicar) to depose her, from all her Royal Dignity,
and all that Dominion, to which she had (by Birth, the Law of God, and the
Land) a just Right, in the following Form --

3. And we Quinetiam ipsam praetenso REGNIJURE, nec non OMNI and quocunque
DOMINIO, DIGNITATE, privilegioque PRIVATAM. Ibid. Sect. 4.
Deprive her of her pretended Royal Right, and all Dominion, Dignity and
Privilege whatsoever. He calls it, Her PRETENDED Royal Right, because
(according to their Rebellious and Impious Principles) she being an Heretic,
(as they miscalled her) for that Crime she had lost her Royal Right, even
before her actual Excommunication. Nor is this all; he proceeds --

4. And further, Item Proceres subditos and populos dicti Regni, ac caeteros
OMNES, qui illi QUOMODOCUNQUE JURAVERUNT, a JURAMENTO huiusmodi, ac OMNI
prorsus dominii, sidelitatis and obsequii debito perpetuo absolutos and
praesenti authoritate absolvimus. Ibid. Sect. 5.
we Absolve all the Nobility, Subjects, and People of England, and all others
who have any way Sworn to her, from such Oath; and we declare them FOR EVER
Absolved from any Obligation of Allegiance or Obedience to her; and we do, (by
these Presents) Absolve them. So that here, (so far as was able) he Absolves
all her Subjects, from the Obligation of the Oaths, in which they had sworn
Allegiance. But because there is, (as the Lawyers truly say) A Natural, as well
A Sworn Allegiance; (for, by Birth, they who never swore it, owe a Natural
Allegiance to their Prince, being born Subjects) lest, (after their Oath was
nulled) they should Obey the Queen, and (upon the Principle of Natural
Allegiance) think themselves bound so to do; He goes on, to declare this
Natural Bond Null, and frees them from any Obligation of it: Thus: --

5. We Praecipimus and interdicimus UNIVERSIS and singulis PROCERIBUS,,
subditis populis and aliis praedictis, ne ILLI, ejusve MONITIS, MANDATIS, aut
LEGIBUS audeant OBEDIRE. Qui secus secerint simili Anathematis sententia
innodamus. Ibid, Sect. 5.
Command, and Forbid all the Peers, People and Subjects of England, to dare to
give any Obedience to the Queen, her Monitions, Commands, or Laws. And if any
do otherwise, we involve them in the same Sentence of Anathema and
Excommunication. Whence it evidently appears, 1. That the Pope, in this
Authentic Bull, and Decretory Sentence, does (so far as he is able) Depose
the Queen. 2. Absolve all her Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance. 3. And
(under pain of Excommunication) command and require them, (contrary to their
Natural Allegiance) to give no Obedience to their undoubted Sovereign. Nor is
this all for,

6. When he had done all this, he gave away the Queens Kingdom, and Dominions,
to Philip the Second, King of Spain; as is notoriously known, and In
depositione Elizabethe. Pius 5. Jus Britanniae and Hiberniae ad Philippum 2.

Many more such impious Bulls there are in the Roman Bullary, in all which
Kings and Princes and Anathematized and deposed by the Pope, and their Subjects
absolved from their Oaths of Allegiance on pretense of that vast and
extravagant Supremacy and Dominion over all the World, (which they challenge by
Divine Right, though without any and against all Reason) even over Kings and
Emperors. For instance, the Excommunication and Deposition of the Bullarium

Kings, Dukes, and all of what Dignity soever: and this Anathema is repeated
every year. So that (amongst others) our Gracious King, and all his Protestant
Subjects, are Anathematized and Cursed once every year at Rome, as if their
Mons Vaticanus, were become Mount Ebal, Deuteronomy. 11. 29. and 27. 12.
from whence all Curses were to come. Now, whether this Doctrine and Practices
of Popes be not dangerous and pernicious to Kings, let the World Judge.

Well, but if all this will not do; if the Testimonies of their own Writers,
(which both for learning and dignity in their Church, are most eminent) nor
their received and established Laws and Canons; nor their Authentic Papal
Bulls Vid Pauli Papae. 4. Bullam 12. in Bullario Cherubini. Romae 1638. Tom. 1.

and Decretal Constitutions: I say, if all these be not evidence enough, to
entitle the Church of Rome to this Seditious, Impious, and (to Kings
especially, if they be Protestants) Pernicious Doctrine; yet the Decrees and
Canons of their own General Councils, (which, (by their own Principles and
Confessions) are Representatives of their whole Church, and Infallible) I say,
the Decrees of such Councils (if there be any such) will, and must be
undeniable Evidences of what I have said in this particular. And, that their
approved General Councils have approved this Doctrine of the Popes Power to
depose Kings and Emperors, and absolve their Subjects from their Oaths of
Allegiance, I shall give you two or three evident Instances.

I. In the General It is one of those General Councils, which the Council of
Constans decreed all future Popes should sweat to maintain: Sess. 39. In forma

Pope Innocent the Fourth deposed the Emperor Frederique the Second; That he
deposed him in that Council, is undeny'd by any I have yet met with; and that

appears by the form of the Excommunication, registered, and upon Record in the
Body of their Canon Law. Where, 1. He Omni honor and dignitate sententiando

deprives him of all his Honor and Imperial Dignity. 2. And then Omnes qui ei

Council, (for so they commonly call it) in which (if they misreckon not) there
were no less than 1215. Fathers) it was Synodically and Categorically
concluded, That the Pope might depose Kings, absolve their Subjects from their
Oaths of Allegiance, and give away their Kingdoms. The Series and Sum of the
Canon is this; First, It is decreed, That all Secular Powers shall expel all
(whom the Pope and his Party shall call) Heretics, out of their Dominions,
and they were to be admonished to do this, Moneantur seculares potestates, etc.
Secondly, But in case they obeyed not that Monition, they were to be Si necesse

of Ecclesiastical Persons, and the Liberties of the Church; and they are to

We PEREMPTORILY COMMAND KINGS, etc. Secondly, Well then, by this Lateran
Council and Canon, we are speaking of, Kings are to be COMPELLED, by the Pope,
to do their duty; and that is (as the Canon tells us) to expel all Heretics
out of their Kingdoms. And if you ask, Who, or What Heretics those are? The
same Canon tells you, That it is all those, whom the Pope and his Party, shall
be pleased to Haereticos AB ECCLESIA NOTATOS.
call Heretics. Thirdly, And they (Kings and Princes) must be COMPELLED to
take an OATH, and swear they will Expel such Heretics; and this Oath they
must take publicly, (that all may see and know that Princes obey the Pope) for
the words of the Canon are,.... Praestent JURAMENTUM PUBLIC, quod universos
Haereticos, AB ECCLESIA NOTATOS exterminare studeant. Fourthly, And if any
King, or Prince Si requisitus neglexerit, per Metropolitanum and

words of the Canon.
neglect this duty, and (when it is tendered) refuse the Oath, or to expel
Heretics out of his Dominions; Then the Metropolitan and the Bishops of his
Province must Excommunicate him. Fifthly, And then if he persist contumacious,
and refuse to give satisfaction by expelling all Heretics; they must signify
it to the POPE, that he Ut ex tunc ipse Papa VASALLOS ab ejus FIDELITATE
denunciat ABSOLUTOS, and TERRAM exponant CATHOLICIS OCCUPANDAM.
may DEPOSE HIM, ABSOLVE HIS SUBJECTS FROM THEIR OATHS OF ALLEGIANCE, and GIVE
HIS KINGDOM TO CATHOLICS. So the Canon. So that if the Pope, and a Popish
General Council, very great for number, (but as for Learning and Loyalty little
enough) consisting of 1215. Fathers; I say, if these may be Judges, Kings and
Princes are Subjects and Slaves to the Pope, who may COMPEL them to expel as
many of their own Subjects, as he shall call (or miscall) Heretics, out of
their Dominions; and impose an Oath upon them, to bind them to obedience, and
unless they obey such Papal commands, the Pope may depose the Prince who
disobeys, absolve his Subjects from all Oaths of Allegiance, and his Kingdom (
forfeited to the Pope by his disobedience) may be given away, to any, to whom
the Pope shall please to give it. Now whether such impious and rebellious
Positions ( approved and owned by the Roman Church, in her greatest General
Councils, which, she believes, (at least would have us believe) infallible) be
not dangerous and pernicious to Princes, and destructive of their just rights,
let the World Judge. I know, that although the Sea a Book lately printed,
called, The Jesuits Loyalty. It contains three Letters of a Jesuit, (Father
Kein, or Keins, (if I forget not) was the Man) in which this ^ateral Canon, and
all the consequences of it, are approv'ed, and the Popes Power to depose Kings,
(out of Popish Authors and Councils) largely, and data Opera, proved to be de
fide.
Jesuits and Canonists publicly approve and own the Doctrine of this Canon
and the Lateran Council, and the consequences of it; yet some more sober
Papists do not: And therefore two Answers (or insignificant shifts) are brought
by some, to evade or mollify, and lessen the impiety of those consequences,
which are by Protestants inferred from it.

1. First then, say they, that the Lateran Canon 1. Answer.
is to be meant only of Feudatary, or Subordinate, not of Absolute, or Supreme
Princes.

But this is an evident mistake of the meaning of Refutation.
the Lateran Canon, and in terminis, contradicts the express words and sense of
the Canon. For,

1. By the Canon, All Princes, ( Supreme and Subordinate, and Feudatary) if
they refuse to expel all Heretics out of their Dominions, are to be
Excommunicated by the Metropolitan and the Bishops of his Province, and then
Deposed by the Pope: but with this difference expressed in the Canon. When any
Subordinate Prince was Deposed, it was with a Salvo Jure Dominii Principalis.
They are the words of the third Canon of that Lateran Council.
Salvo, or Proviso, for the Rights of his Superior Lord. The Inferior Lord
Deposed, loses only what was his own proper Right; his Superior Lord loses
nothing. If the Inferior Lord was to pay any Rents, or ought any Services to
his Supreme Lord, those he did not forfeit; but those remained due (as before)
to the Supreme Lord. But on this condition, That the Supreme Lord himself did
not Dummodo ipse (Dominus Principalis) nullum praestet obstacul^on, etc. Ibidem.
concur to hinder the expulsion of all Heretics out of the Dominions of the
Feudatary, or Inferior Lord: that is, if he hindered not the Execution of the
Popes commands. For if he did; then even he (the SUPREME LORD) must be Deposed
too, as well as the Inferior Lord. The Law and Decree of that Council, involves
both the Inferior and Supreme Lords, (if both be guilty and negligent in
expelling Heretics) in the same Punishments of Deposition, and loss of their
Dominions. For the Canon says,...... EADEM LEGE SERVATA CIRCA EOS, Qui non
HABENT DOMINOS PRINCIPALES. And this impious Doctrine was not only approved by
Honorius 3. Pope Innocent 3. his next Successor, but approved, confirmed, and
referred into the Body of their Canon Law by Gregory 9. cap Excommunicamus, 13.
Extra. de Haereticis. Afterward Innocentius 4. Anno 1243. Alexander 4. 1258.
Clement 4. Anno 1265. all confirm it, as appears in the Bullarium Magnum
Romanum Lugduni, 1655. Tom. 1. page 109. col. 2. And lest it might be thought
that they have altered their opinion now, and are become more favorable to
Princes, they have lately added the confirmation of it by Innocentius 4. to the
Body of their Canon Law, Lugd. 1661. Vid. 7. Decret. Lib. 5. Tit. 3. De Haeret.
and Schism. cap. 1. 2.
That THE SAME LAW MUST BE OBSERVED CONCERNING THOSE who (have, and) have no
SUPERIOR LORDS. That is; the Supreme Lords, (be it King or Emperor) if they
Obey not the Pope's command, and effectually expel all Heretics out of their
Dominions, they must (by this Canon) be Deposed.

2. But admit (which is evidently untrue) that the Canon meant only Feudatary
and Inferior Princes should be Deposed by the Pope. The mischief and injustice
is less, (as a Subordinate Prince is less than the Supreme) but very great: and
(even upon this false Supposition) this Power challenged by the Pope, (and
approved by the Lateran Canon and Council) will be not only dangerous, but
pernicious to Subordinate and Feudatary Princes. This is too plain to need any
further proof.

The second Answer some bring to what we urge 2 Answer.
against Rome from the Lateran Canon, is this: The Author of the Answer to The
Jesuits Loyalty, London, 1678. page 12. Father Preston, under the name of
Wytherington, etc.
They deny that Council to be a General One, or (if it were) that it made any
Canons: and therefore the Doctrine of that Canon (whatever it be) cannot be
imputed to the Church of Rome, as Approved by it.

But this is as void of Ground or Truth, as the former. Refut.
For this Lateran Council (and the Canons of it) have been, and are universally
received in the Church of Rome, the Council as In the Bull by which Innocent 3.
called the Lateran Council, the Title is this, -- Indictio sacri and OECUMENICI
Concilii Lateranensis pro. 1. die Nov. 1215. In Bullario. Romans Tom. 1. page 87.
Edit. 1655.
Ecumenical, and the Canons attributed to it, as Genuine, and not
Supposititious, and Spurious. That this may appear, consider,

1. That all their Writers de Conciliis (which I have hitherto met with) do
universally acknowledge it to have been a General Council, and commonly call
it, Concilium Lateranense Magnum, and cite the Canons attributed to it, as
Genuine.

2. All the Popish Writers, who have published the Councils, or Epitome's, and
Sum of them, (as Crabb, Surius, Binius, Joverius, Caranza, etc. publish it as a
General Council. And Joverius confidently says,.... Non video qua front audeat
qnis negare hoc Concilium esse Oecumenicum. Joverius Council. Part. 1. page 120.
in Lemmate Concilio praefixo.
That he cannot see, with what Face any Man dare deny it to be a General
Council.

3. In their last and best Vid. Edit. Juris Canonici Paris. 1612, and 1618, and
Lugduni. 1661. etc.
Editions of their Canon Law, there is (in the beginning) a distinct Catalogue
of their General and Provincial Councils, acknowledged to be such, and this
Lateran is ever reckoned amongst those which they admit as General.

2. There is a commonly received distinction amongst their Writers de
Conciliis, wherein they So Bellarm^^^, Longas a Coriolano, Rives, etc.
tell us, That Concilia Generalia s^nt. 1. Approbata. 2. Reprobata. 3. Partim
approbata, partim reprobata. 4. Nec approbata nec reprobata, of which last sort
they make the first Council of Pisa. Now this Lateran Council, (we are speaking
of) they always reckon amongst the General Councils of the first Order, or
those which are approved by their Church. Though this distinction of Councils
be ridiculous, and inconsistent with Truth, or their own Principles; as (were
it my business now, or pertinent) might evidently be proved: yet (by it) it
manifestly appears, that the Lateran Council was (in their Opinion and
Judgment) a General Council; which is that for which I produce it. But further,
I say,

5. In their own Canon Law, (and as in others before, so in a late and approved
Corpus Juris Canonici Lugduni. 1661.
Edition of it) this Lateran Council under Pope Innocent the Third, is
acknowledged to be a General, or Ecumenical Council. For in the Decretals,
published by the Authority and Command of Pope Vide Bullam Gregorii. 9.
Decretalibus praefixam.

they, (and none else without Papal Authority) should be used by all Judges in

by a Bull of Bulla haec Romae data Anno 1580. Jul. 1. and Corp. Juris Canon

Gregory the Thirteenth. In the very first Chapter of those Decretals, the
Lemma, or Title prefixed to it, is thus: Cap. Firmiter 1. Extra, De Summa
Trinitate. The Title to that Chapter is this -- Innocentius 3. in Concilio
GENERALI.
Innocent the Third, in a General Council: And that we may be sure, it is the
Lateran Council he means; a Antonius Naldus:-.-.- Hoc Concilium Rom^ in
Laterano celebratum, Anno 1215. and Innocentii 3. 18. assistentibus Hierosol.
and Constantinop. Patriarchis, and TOTIUS FERE ORBIS EPISCOPIS, etc.
great Lawyer in his Annotations, (subjoined to that Bull of Gregory the Ninth
before mentioned) tells us, That this Council was held at Rome, in the Lateran,
in the Year 1215. in the Eighteenth Year of Innocent the Third. The Patriarchs
of Jerusalem and Constantinople, and the Bishops of almost the WHOLE WORLD,
etc. So that if the Title of a Decretal published by Pope Gregory the Ninth, or
the Annotation upon it, by Naldus an eminent Lawyer, and the Approbation and
Confirmation of both, by Pope Gregory the Thirteenth, be true; it will
evidently follow, that the Lateran Council was a General or Ecumenical
Council. And afterward, in the same Canon Law and Decretals, we meet with this
Title to another Chapter;...... Cap. Nimis. 30. Extra De Jurejurando.
Idem in Concilio Generali. And it appears, (both by the former Cap. Veniens.

6. Lastly, To put the matter out of doubt, that the Lateran Council was
Ecumenical, and made Canons, the Council of Constans does Council. Constant.

swear, at their coming to the Papal Dignity. And although these Authorities be
abundantly sufficient to satisfy our more sober Adversaries; yet I shall add
one more, which may (I hope) silence the more Confident. It is the Authority of
the Sess, 24. cap. 5. de Reformat. page 290. Edit. Salamant. 1588.
Constitutionem, sub Innocentio 3. in CONCILIO GENERALI, quae incipit, Qualiter
and quando Synodus innovat.
Trent-Council, which does expressly call it a General Council, and confirms one
of its Canons.

The sum of this Discourse is; That if the Concurrent Testimonies, 1. Of their
own most learned, and (for Dignity) most eminent Writers de Conciliis; 2. Or
their Publishers of their Councils General and Provincial; 3. Or many Decrees
of their Popes generally approved and received into their Canon Law, of the
last, and (as they tell us) of the most correct Editions; 4. Or of their
General Councils (for such they esteem them) of Constance and Trent: I say, if
all these be of any validity, (and with them, some of those Testimonies are
infallible) then it will evidently follow; 1. That this Lateran Council under
Pope Innocent the Third, is (and, with them, must be) an Ecumenical or General
Council. 2. And so, those Impious and Damnable Positions in the Third Canon of
that Council, (1. That Kings and Emperors may be Excommunicated by their own
Bishops for not obeying the Pope: 2. And Deposed by the Pope: 3. And their
Subjects Absolved by him, from their Oaths of Allegiance: 4. And their Kingdoms
given away to those, who Obey and please the Pope:) I say, all those Positions,
must be acknowledged to be the Doctrines of the Roman Church, being Decrees and
Constitutions of her received General Councils, which she professes to be
infallible, and therefore obliging her to a firm belief of them. 3. This being
evidently so, that the Pope and his Party (obliged thereunto, by their approved
and received Canon Law, and their General Councils) do believe, and publicly
profess, such Impious, Traitorous, and Damnable Doctrines; it will be easy for
all (who have good Eyes, and will use them) to see, how Dangerous and
Pernicious such Principles are, to all (especially Protestant) Kings, Princes,
and their People and Subjects. And that,

1. In point of Conscience, and in respect of their Souls and Salvation, if
they believe and receive such Impious Positions and Principles. 2. In point of
Civil Prudence, in respect of their Persons, Honors and Estates, if they
receive them not.
1. In point of Conscience, if they submit to the Pope, and believe and receive
such Heretical Positions, and Damnable Doctrines, it must of necessity, be
Dangerous and Pernicious to their Souls. For this Argument will be both
consequent, and evident: To believe Heretical and Damnable Opinions and
Doctrines, is Dangerous and Pernicious to the Soul; (this all Sides confess:)
But to believe that the Pope can Excommunicate and Depose Kings, absolve their
Subjects, from their Oaths of Allegiance, so as they may I say, Lawfully;
according to their Popish Principles. For, 1. They say, It is not Treason to
kill such a King after deposition, for he is not King then, nor his People
(absolved from their Oaths of Fidelity*) Subjects. Nor is it Murder; for their
Supreme and infallible Judge, the Pope, has determined and made it Law; NON
SUNT HOMICIDAE, qui adversus Excommunicatos, ZELO MATRIS ECCLESIAE ARMANTUR,
EOSQUE TRUCIDANT. This is the determination of Pope Urban the Second. And it is

Heretical and Damnable Doctrine; as is declared in a great and full Parliament
I do from my heart abjure and detest, as Impious and Heretical; that Damnable
Doctrine and Position; That Princes, that are Excommunicated or deprived by the
Pope, may be Deposed or Murdered by their Subjects, or any other. So the Oath

need not use to you, (or any who love truth; and the Church of England) to
prove the error and impiety of such Opinions, and the danger those poor deluded
Souls are in, who believe and practice them. The (...) the Original Error, from
which the rest follow, is that vast Supremacy, which the Pope (as Peter's
Successor) challenges, and (when he has ability) Usurps over Kings. A power
St. Peter never had, nor pretended to; who knew no power in himself, or any
other mere Man, superior to Kings. 1 Pet. 2. 13. This place troubled Pope
Innocent the 3d; and if you will consult and consider his ridiculous, as well
as erroneous Exposition of it, you will have reason to think him a Fool, rather
than Infallible; and yet it is in their CanonLaw. Cap. Solicitae. 6. Extra De

contradiction, to say, any thing is SUPERIOR to that which is Supreme. St.
Peter commands all to SUBMIT themselves to their Kings (and there were none
then but Pagan and Idolatrous Princes) and obey them as SUPREME Governors; the
Pope command^ Subjects to disobey their Kings (if he miscall them Heretics) to
refuse any assistance or subjection to them, to take Arms against them, and

person tell me, whether they can (in this case) disobey the Apostle, and obey
these impious commands of the Pope, without great and apparent danger to their
Souls? Our blessed Savior (whose Vicar the Pope pretends to be) does himself

I APPEAL TO CAESAR (says he.) It Is evident, that all Appeals are from an
Inferior, to a Superior Judge, and one who has Jurisdiction over the Apellant,
and cognizance of the crime, and therefore Paul appealing to Caesar, does (
ipso facto) acknowledge him his legal and superior Judge. So far was St. Paul
from believing those Popish and Rebellious Principles, and from Disloyalty, or
Disobedience to that Imperial (though Pagan) Power, under which he lived; that
he publicly acknowledged, and humbly submitted to it. 2. Nor was he only in
his own person obedient, and a loyal subject to the Emperor, but (Writing to
the Romans) he did, as an Apostle of Jesus Christ, command them also to be
Loyal and Obedient Romans 13. 1.

powers here, he means men possessing Supreme Power; and the Supreme power
under which he and the Romans then were, was Nero, a most impious Pagan, and
persecuter of Christ and Christians; and yet every soul within his Empire (even
Peter as well as Paul) was (by ^the Law of God and the Gospel) to be subject to
him, to fear, honor, pay him Tribute and Loyally obey him. As, (by the
before-said Examples and precepts of St. Paul, and our blessed Savior)
evidently appears. Now your Popish Doctrine, and (by them) Approved Principles*
contradicts all this; and let St. Peter, Paul and our blessed Savior say, or
do what they will; let them acknowledge Caesar's Supreme Power, and command
obedience to him (though a Pagan) and submit to his power themselves: yet at
Rome, they acknowledge NO SUPREME POWER but the POPE; whom (as I have before

judge, whether it be not a great crime and crying sin, for any subjects to
believe this rebellious and Popish doctrine, against the express command of our
blessed Savior and his Apostles in the Gospel? And if it be (as undeniably it
is) then it is as certain, that the belief and practice of such doctrine and
principles, is not only dangerous, but (without repentance) pernicious and
damnable to those miserably deluded Souls, who do so believe and practice it.

And it is considerable, and undeniably certain, that their Popish Doctrine,
and received principles, do not only approve the Excommunication and
Deposition of Kings, the Absolution of their Subjects from their Oaths of
Allegiance, their Prohibition of them to obey the Laws or Commands of their
Princes so deposed, that they may take Arms, and innocently Kill all
Heretics, (Princes or People.) But they are encouraged to do this, (by their
Popes Decretals, approved and received Vid. Oratian. Can. Omnium 46. Cause. 23.

Life, if they die in the War against the Enemies of the Roman Faith, Heretics
and Infidels. This was a fair promise; but Pope Innocent the Third, (Popes
having for some Ages been liberal in promising what they had no power to give)
promises more; for besides a Plenary Remission of Sins, he promises, not only
Heaven, but a Vid. Bullam Innocenti 3. dat. Laterani 19. Call. Jan. Anno

Waldenses, which with barbarous and inhumane cruelty they did. Now how
dangerous to the Soul, Sin so encouraged must be, a weak-sighted Man may easily
see, without Spectacles or further proof. Be it concluded then; such Popish
Principles (when believed and practiced) are not only dangerous to the Soul,
but pernicious, and (without repentance) destructive of Salvation.

2. But, besides that such Popish Doctrines and Principles (in point of
Conscience) are dangerous to the Soul, and (without true repentance)
destructive of Salvation; they are also (if considered in Civil Prudence)
dangerous and pernicious to Princes, and Supreme Powers; depriving them (when
put in execution) of all their Honors, Estates, and Lives too. The truth of
this is (without further proof) notorious, by the sad and miserable Ruins of
many great Princes, caused by Popes and their Party, who approved and practiced
such Rebellious Popish Principles, as we are speaking of. I say, the ruin of
great Princes.

1. Before the Reformation, (who were no Protestants) and some since, who were
Papists too. 2. Since the Reformation, who were indeed Protestants, or as such
(or favorers of them) Excommunicated, and deprived of their Crowns and
Kingdoms; though the Excommunications did prove bruta fulmina, vain and
ineffectual, and did not that mischief, which their impious Author intended:
for which we are to thank the good Providence of Heaven, and not the Pope.
1. For the first; Authentic Stories tell us, that Pope And a little before
him, Pope Gregory 2. Deposed the Emperor Leo Isaurus, because he was against
Images, which was Anno 729. Vid. Baron. Annal. ad Annum 730. Number. 5. Where he
has this Note concerning that Emperors Deposition: -- Sic exemplum posteris

PRINCIPES. The Cardinal every where highly approves this Doctrine, etc. Vid.
Baron. ad Ann. 593. Number. 86.
Zachary Deposed Childerick (or Chilperick) King of France, about the middle of
the Eighth Century. 2. Gregory the Seventh Deposes Henry the Fourth, and
causes great and miserable Rebellions and Bloodshed in the Roman Empire, in
the Eleventh Century. 3. Pope Sylvester the Third, in the Twelfth Century,
Excommunicates the Emperor Henry the Fifth, Et Magnas turbas in Germania
excitat (says Urspergensis.) 4. Pope Innocent the Third Excommunicates Otto the
Fourth, in the beginning of the Thirteenth Century. 5. Innocent the Fourth, in
the same Century, Deposed the Emperor Frederick the Second. In short, (to omit
many others) the barbarous Murders of Henry the Third and Fourth of France,
have been, and most justly were, and will be imputed to these Popish
Principles, in the belief of which, those impious Assassins were confirmed and
Catechized. Sure I am, that Pope Sixtus the Fifth did approve and highly
magnify the impious Fact of Jaques Clement the Dominican, who was the Murderer
of Henry the Third, in that famous (and impious) This Speech of Sixtus ^. was
Printed at Paris, An. 1589. according to the Latin Copy printed at Rome, as is
attested by three Doctors of the Sorbon.
Speech of his, made to his Cardinals (no doubt as well pleased as the Pope) in
the Consistory; and afterward Published and Printed at Rome: An evident
Argument, that they were not (though great reason they should have been)
ashamed of it: for certainly they would never have Printed what they did not
approve.

2. But although the Popish Positions and Principles we are speaking of, are
dangerous to all Supreme Powers, (even Roman Catholics, as appears by what is
already said) yet more especially to all Protestant Princes and People: For,

1. All Protestant ( Kings and Subjects) being declared Heretics, are
Excommunicated, and solemnly The form of that Excommunication is now extant in

of their Canon Law. Now this Excommunication contains many considerable
particulars, As, 1. All Heretics, of what dignity Quacunque dignitate, etiam

soever, Barons, Earls, Marquesses, Dukes, Kings, and Emperors: none excepted,
they are all involved in the same Curse and Anathema. 2. Nor is it only those
Heretics who then were in being, but ALL also, which Quicunque HACTENUS a
^ide deviarunt, seu INPOSTERUM deviabunt, seu in Haeresin incident, etc.
AFTERWARD SHOULD BE. So that our gracious King and his Protestant subjects
now, are as much under the Curse, as Q. Elizabeth and her subjects were, in the
First of her Reign, when that Bull was first published. 3. Nor was this Bull
rashly made, but after Habita cum Card. deliberatione matura, and de eorum
Consilio, and Unanimi assensu, etc.
mature deliberation with the Cardinals, and by their Counsel, and unanimous
consent. It was (it seems) a premeditated and deliberate* as well as an Impious
Act they were about; for impious it was, and by all sober and impartial Judges,
ever will be thought so. 4. The punishments which this Bull ties upon
Heretics, are Omnes Suspensionis, Excommunicationis, Interdicti, Privationis
poenas, a QUIBUSVIS Romans Pontificibus, aut pro TALIBUS HABITIS, per eorum
literas Extravagantes, seu in Consiliis seu Patrum Decretis and Canonibus
QUOMODOLIBET contra Haereticos Latas, approbamus, innovamus, and PERPETUO
OBSERVARI Volumus, etc.
Excommunication, Suspension, Deprivation, and all other punishments, which any
Pope, in any Papal Canon or Constitution (howsoever made) denounced against
Heretics; all which Canons and Constitutions he approves, confirms, and will
have PERPETUALLY observed. 5. And for Kings Regnis and Imperio PENITUS and IN
TOTUM, PERPETUO sint PRIVATI, and ad illa de caetero inhabiles and INCAPACES,
etc.
and Emperors (the same is for Barons, Earls, Marquisses and Dukes) they are
TOTALLY and FOR EVER DEPRIVED of their Kingdoms and Empires, and made
incapable ever to enjoy them. The same Censure passes upon Bishops,
Archbishops, which were Heretics then, when the Curse was published, ( vel in
posterum in Haeresin incident) or for the future EVER SHOULD BE Heretics. Nor
is this Constitution (which denounces this Curse) temporary; But CONSTITUTIO
IN PERPETUUM VALITURA, a Constitution and a Curse to be in force, and effectual
against Heretics, for ever. Nor is there any need, of any Legal Process to
convict any person of Heresy, before the Curse come upon him: but, EO IPSO
ABSQUE ALIQUO JURIS VEL FACTI MINISTERIO (they are the words of this impious
Excommunication) All Heretics, by being so, without any accusation, or legal
conviction, are actually under that curse: So that our gracious King, all his
Protestant Nobility, all Archbishops and Bishops, Eorum etiam Vid. Constit. 34.
Clementis Papae 10. which next follows, and Alexandri 7. Constit. 16. dat.
Romae, Anno 1656. In Bullario Romano, Tom. 4. p. 218. where we are referred to
many more such forms of Excommunications.
receptatores, fautores, etc. and all who shall receive, or any way favor them,
stand actually Excommunicated and Accursed. And here I desire to know of our
Papists, who do (as much as any) pretend to Loyalty; do they (as good subjects
should) favor their King, or do they not? If not, then they neither are, nor
can be good subjects: If they do, then they disobey their Supreme and
Infallible Judges, and are (as well as we) under the Excommunication and the
Popes Curse, and so no members of their so much (and with so little reason)
magnified Roman Church.

2. But lest this Excommunication and Curse might not prove so effectual as
they desire, to blast all Protestants (which they make, for they are not so,
the worst of all Heretics) the Curse, to make Sure Work (as they think, and
would have it) is solemnly renewed every year, in that famous (and impious)
Bulla A Form of this Bull we have in Bullar. Roman. Tom. 4. p. 528. Constit.
34. Clement. 10. An. 1671.
Coenae Domini, read every year on Maundy-Thursday. Wherein all Protestants are
(by name) cursed, whether Princes or People. We Excommunicamus and
Anathematizamus, ex part Dei, and authoritate Petri and Pauli, ac nostra,
quoscunque Hussitas, Wickliffistas, Lutheranos, Zuinglianos, Calvinistas,
Ugonottos, etc. Eorumque receptatores, fautores, and desensores.
Excommunicate and Curse (says the Pope in that Bull) All Hussites,
Wickliffists, Lutherans, Zwinglians, Calvinists, Hugonots, etc. And whosoever
shall RECEIVE, DEFEND, or FAVOR them. And here again, it will concern our Roman
Catholics seriously to consider, into what straits, the ambition and
unparalled pride of their Popes, has brought them. For if ( according to
their duty) they defend their King, they are cursed at Rome. And if they do not
defend him, then they do not perform that duty of Allegiance and Fidelity to
their King, to which (by the Law of God and Nature) they are indispensably
bound, and so will be ( according to their desert) accused in Heaven. And here,
It is a short Question which they are concerned to Answer; Whether they resolve
to obey God, or the Pope.

3. But this is not all; for after this Excommunication and Curse laid upon all
Protestant Princes, after their deposition and total deprivation of all their
royal power and dignity, and a perpetual incapacity brought upon them,
disabling them for ever to return to those lost rights: another Curse is
consequent, and immediately follows such Excommunication: Their Subjects are
declared free from all Obligations of Loyalty and Fidelity, due to such
Princes, while they stand Excommunicate. This the Decretal of Pope Honorius 3.
Praeposito Archidiac. and H. Canonico Suession.
Honorius the Third, (and it is made Cap. Gravem, 13. Extra De Poenis.
Law by Pope Gregory the Ninth, and approved and confirmed by Pope In Bulla,
Corp. Juris Can. praefixa.
Gregory the Thirteenth) tells us, That while any Domino Excommunicato Manente,
SUBDITI FIDELITATEM NON DEBENT. So the Lemma, or Title of that 13 Chapter.
Lord remains Excommunicate, his SUBJECTS OWE HIM NO ALLEGIANCE or FIDELITY.
That Is the Title: and then it follows in the Decretal, (speaking of a Count who
was Excommunicate) that the Pope commands those to whom he writes, That they
should Fideles ipsius (quamdiu in Excommunicatione perstiterint) ab ejus
FIDELITATIS JURAMENTO denuncietis PENIIUS ABSOLUTOS. They are the words of the
Law; and if you consult the Gloss and Card. Turrecramata's Commentary upon it,
you may find more to that Purpose.
declare to the Subjects of that Excommunicated Count, that they were FULLY
ABSOLVED FROM THEIR OATH OF FIDELITY while their Lord continued Excommunicate.
How dangerous this Doctrine may be, to our Gracious King, and all Protestant
Princes, (who stand actually Excommunicated at Rome) and how little trust they
can repose in their Popish Subjects, I need not tell you: Seeing such subjects,
by their Authentic laws, and the declared and definitive sentence of their
supreme and Infallible Judge, are assured that they owe no Allegiance or
Fidelity to their Excommunicated Sovereigns.

4. Nor is this all; for there is (at least in the judgment and belief of our
Adversaries) a far greater and more pernicious consequent and effect of their
Excommunication and Curse of Protestant Princes. For the mischiefs of their
Excommunications hitherto mentioned, are only temporal, (though the greatest
in that kind possible) as loss of their Royal Power, Livelihood, and Life it
self. But they say, there is an other, a Spiritual effect, which concerns the
Soul, and is the greatest mischief and misery it is capable of. For they say,
that Heretics ( Protestants, with them are declared such) dying
Excommunicate, ( as all good Protestants do) are eternally damned. For, 1. A
very great Excommunicatus est MEMBRUM DIABOLI. Lindewood in Glossa, ad Cap.
Seculi Principes. Verbo Reconciliationis. De Immunitate Ecclesiae.
Canonist of our own Nation (while Popery unhappily prevailed here) tells us;
that every Excommunicated person is a MEMBER OF THE DEVIL: And for further
proof of this, he cites Gratian, and the Gratian. Can. Omnis Christianus 32.
Cause. 11. Quaest. 3.
Canon Law. And a far greater Author than Lindewood, or Gratian, and (in our
days) long after them, more plainly tells us: Non modo deponi, sed etiam
excommunicari, and in AETERNO EXAMINE DAMNARI DECREVIT. Baron. Annal. Tom. 8.
ad Annum Chrsti 593. Number. 86.
that Pope Gregory the Seventh did not only depose the Emperor Henry the
Fourth, but Excommunicate, and DECREE HIM TO BE ERETNALLY DAMND. And for this,
he cites Pope Gregory's own Gregorius 7. lib. 4. Epist. 2. and 23. and lib. 8.
Epist. 21.
Epistles, who best knew his own mind, and the meaning of his own Decree. So
that in the Popes and Cardinals Judgment such an Excommunication is a
definitive sentence, and a Papal Decree; whereby the persons Excommunicate are
consigned and doomed to Eternal Damnation. Whence we may understand the meaning
of the Titles usually prefixed to such Damnatory Bulls of Excommunication; such
as these, Bullario Roman. Paull. 3. Constit. 7. p. 704. Tom. 1. in Magno
Bullario Romano Lugduni 1655.
.... DAMNATIO and Excommunicatio Hen. 8. by Pope Paul the Third, Constit. Pii
5. 101. Ibidem. Tom. 2. p. 303. Edit. 1655.
DAMNATIO and Excommunicatio Elizabethae, by Pius the Fifth, where it seems,
(by what the Pope and Cardinal before told us) that it is not any temporal, (or
not that only) but the eternal damnation of Soul and Body, which is intended
and desired by them, in their uncharitable and impious Anathema's and
Excommunications. Whence also it manifestly follows; that all Protestants,
Kings and Subjects, Princes and People, (who, by many Papal Bulls and
Anathema's, stand actually Cursed and Excommunicated) are in a damnable
condition, and if they die, (as they do, and should) without Popish Absolution,
by this Roman, Uncharitable, and Unchristian Divinity, they are eternally
damned. This I say, not that I think such Papal Bulls and Excommunications
either have, or can have any such effects, or bring such danger to Protestants
(Kings or Subjects) as is pretended; for I believe and know, that they are
bruta fulmina, insignificant Squibs of false Fire; which can neither hurt their
Souls here, nor hinder their Salvation hereafter. But notwithstanding this,
they may prove dangerous and pernicious to Protestant Princes, as they may be,
and are great encouragements to their Popish Subjects, to rebel, and disobey
their Sovereigns, and securely (as to any thing of Conscience or Injustice in
it) act any thing to their ruin. For they who believe the Popes pretended
Power, that he can deprive their Prince of all Royal Power and Dignity, and
that he has actually done it; that he has absolved them from all Obligations of
Allegiance and Fidelity due to him; that he is a Member of the Devil here, and
surely to be damned hereafter, and that to kill him is no Murder. I say, those
who submit to the Pope, and believe these Erroneous and Impious Doctrines, (as
all must who believe the Pope, or the Roman Church Infallible) have too much
encouragement, not only to disobey and rebel, but (when they have power and
opportunity) to take away their Princes Life, as being a Person odious to God
and Man, and by the Pope, (their Infallible and Supreme Judge) by their
approved Laws, and their General Councils, declared to be such; especially
seeing that if they miscarry in that attempt, (and while they seek their
Princes Life, lose their own) yet their Names shall (in Red Letters) be
Registered in the Calendar, and they (by their Party) shall be reputed Martyrs;
as all know, that Campian, Garnet, and our Powder-Traytors are. An honor, I am
so far from envying them that I should be very glad (and so would many
thousands more) to see our present Conspirators (according to their merit)
referred into their Calendar amongst such Martyrs; that so we might be freed
from the fears of those Prodigious Villains and mischiefs they intended and
endeavored to act here, against their Gracious Sovereign, the Church and
State, and there is too much reason to believe, that (while they live, and have
ability and opportunity) they will prosecute those Black Designs. Dirum omen
misericors (qui solus potest) averruncet Deus.

These are the known Positions and Doctrines of the Church of Rome, approved
and received by the Supreme Authority of that Church; which (in Thesi) when
they are believed, may be very dangerous, and when (in Praxi) put in execution,
(and they who believe such impious Doctrines, act accordingly) pernicious to
all Kings, Princes, and People, especially Heretics (as they miscal them) who
embrace not all their Popish Errors, in which number all Protestants (Kings and
Subjects) are, by them, always included. And that the Popish Party, (especially
Jesuits) since their unhappy appearing in the The Order of the Jesuits was
approved and Instituted by Pope Paul the Third, Anno 1540. and highly
encouraged by succeeding Popes. Vile Bullarium Romanum Lugduni 1665. Tom. 1. p.
738.
World, as also their Ecclesiastiques Secular and Regular, (with their
adherents) have acted according to those Principles, for some Ages last past,
and what Barbarous Murders, Depositions of Princes, and Fatal Tragedies, have
been the sad consequences of such belief and actings, both our own, and
Foreign Historians abundantly testify. And here,

1. I shall pass by the horrid Murders and Massacres of the poor Waldenses; who
(upon prosecution of the foresaid Principles) have been persecuted with Fire
and Sword, Armies Vid. Matthew. Paris ab Anno 1100, and Historian Waldensium;
Directorium Inquisitorum; Historiam Inquisitionis, Armachanum, De statu and
success. Eccles. etc. That Directorium Inquisitorum (I mean) was Writ by Nie.
Eymericus, Printed at Venice. 1607.
and Inquisitions; and very many thousand; (nay, infinite numbers) of them, (as
some of their own Writers testify) have been inhumanely murdered, Causa
indicta and inaudita, (many times) especially in France, to say nothing of
other Countries.

2. I desire you to consider that barbarous and prodigious Villainy, the great
Massacre of Protestants in France, Ann. 1572. where and when above 30. or
40000. Abrege Chronologique etc. par le Sicur de Mezeray, Paris. 1567. Tom. 3,
p. 1082. 1086. ad Annum. 1572.
Innocent Protestants (in Paris, and other parts of France) were suddenly and
inhumanely Murdered, by Papists acting upon such Popish Principles, as I have
before mentioned. And this Horrid Villainy was so far from being publicly
disapproved and damned by the Church of Rome, or the Impious Actors punished;
that the news of it was received at Rome with great Joy, This testified by
Thuanus (a faithful Historian) Hist. lib. 53. ad Annum 1372. p. 837. Edit.
1620. and by Fam. Strada. de Bello Belgico. lib. 7. p. 373. Editionis Romae,
1648.
and giving Thanks to God for it, ( Quasi author and consors sceleris fuisse
Deus): nor was it so at Rome only, but in other places too, Papists received
that news with great joy. An evident argument that they approved both that
Impious Doctrine, and the pernicious effects of it.

3. To omit the many Seditions and Rebellions in the time of Henry the Eighth,
(after he had denied the Popes Supremacy) and Edward the Sixth, (caused by such
Persons and Principles) it is notoriously known, that the same Party, in
prosecution of the same Principles and Popish Interest, did (in the Reign of Q.
Elizabeth) continually conspire, and endeavor to take Vid. Speed's Chron. in
Q. Eliz. Ann. 1584. of Dr. Parries designed Assassination of the Queen, by the
Encouragement of the Jesuits, Card. de Como, and the Pope, promising a Plenary
Indulgence, for that (as they called it) meritorious Act. See the like attempt
of Ed. Squire to poison the Queen, on the like encouragement, in Speed in Vita
Eliz. p. 1263. number. 122.
away the life of that good Queen, by Poison, Pistol, and such other impious
(and to persons of such Principles, usual) ways of Assassination; to raise
Rebellions and Armies (having the Popes Assistance and Blessing to encourage
them to that Villainy) to destroy her and her Religion. And when all this would
not do, (Heaven Blessing, what Rome Impiously Cursed) Pope Pius the Fifth In
depositione Elizabethae Angliae Reginae, Pius 5. Jus Britanniae and Hiberniae,
ad Philip* pum* Hispaniae Regem transuli vi cujus donationis, demandat postea
Sidonius fuit Anno 15 88. Class Hispanica instructus ut regna Britanniae
possideret. Remonstrant. Hibernorum perfiatrem. Rob. Caron. Part. 1. cap. 3.
Sect 4* p. 7.
gives the Kingdoms of England and Ireland to Philip the Second King of Spain,
and he (with the Popes Assistance and Blessing) sends his (as he and his
Holiness imagined) Invincible Armado, to take possession; But that vast Armado,
and the Popish Impious Design, were utterly defeated; not so much by the Queens
Fleet, (which was very inconsiderable) as by great storms and tempests, the
immediate Hand of Heaven, and a most Gracious and Miraculous Providence: And
this was so evident, that the Admiral of that Armado (the Duke of Medina
Sidonia) blasphemously swore, That he feared Jesus Christ was turned Lutheran.
But Philip King of Spain, (hearing of the strange defeat and ruin of his
Fleet, and seeing the Hand of Heaven in it) said more soberly,...... That he
did not send his Fleet to fight against God, (to whose Power and Providence, he
attributed the loss of it) but against Men.

4. The Queen being dead, Popish Conspiracies did not die with her; the Pope
and his Party continue as industrious and (as to their Designs and Plots) as
impious as before. They saw and knew, that King James (a Protestant) was Legal
Successor and Heir to the Crown of England, yet used all Roman Arts, to hinder
his having possession of it; and to this end, Father Parsons (the Jesuit)
writes a Book, to prove (what was evidently untrue, and he could not choose but
know it) That King JAMES had no just Title to the Crown of England; though the
whole Right of the Saxons and Normans, and of the Houses of York and Lancaster,
were entirely and evidently united in him:) But when these Popish and
Jesuitical Arts prevailed not, (having neither true Reason or Religion to
further their Designs, which were impious and irrational) they contrive, and
resolve to execute such a Conspiracy, as (for barbarous and prodigious Villainy)
neither Heathens nor Hell had (till that time) ever put in execution; I mean
the Sea the Act of Parliament 3. Jacobi, Cap. 4, 5. where we are told (by the
Parliament) of the HELLISH Conspiracies of the Jesuits and Seminary Priests.
For a more particular Narrative of the horrid Powder Plot, you may consult an
ingenious Tract, called THE HISTORY OF THE GUNPOWDER-TREASON; and those Authors
out of which he collected it, in the last page of that Tract; and the
Authentic History of the Trial of those Traitors, now in the Press, and
Re-printing.
Gun-Powder-Treason, which was not any ordinary or before-known Wickedness; (as
the Killing a King, or Poisoning a Prince, etc.) but a black and unparalleled
Villainy, worthy Rome and a Jesuit; the Blowing up of a whole Parliament, King,
Lords and Commons, the Murdering of a Kingdom in its Representatives, and this
in a moment, before they could see, or dream of any danger. But though this
(for its impiety) was a prodigious Conspiracy, carried on with sworn secrecy,
and lay hid, in the dark, and under ground; yet there is no Power or Policy
against Providence, nor concealing any thing from the All-seeing Eye of our
God; he saw, and graciously discovered that horrid, Popish-Powder-Treason, to
the Preservation of his People, the Confusion of their Adversaries, and ( nisi
periisset pudor) if they had any, to the Eternal Shame of Papists, and (Popery)
their Religion, which approves and encourages such abominable Impieties.

When King James slept with his Fathers, and was translated to a better
Kingdom, out of the reach of such Popish Conspirators, and whither (without a
serious and timely repentance of such inhumane Villainies) they can never come,
their Designs slept not; they prosecute their Plots and Conspiracies, (to ruin
our Church and established Religion) as much in Charles the First's, as in his
Fathers time. And at last it came to this issue, that (other means failing) the
King This Jesuitical and Popish Plot was discovered by Andreas ab Habernfeld,
to Sir W. Boswell, our Ambassador at the Hague, and by him to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, after whose death the Original was found in the Archbishops
Library, and then printed: and is lately reprinted under this Title, -- The
Grand Designs of Papists in the Reign of CHARLES the First, etc. London, 1678.
where you have an authentic discovery of that (I cannot call it worse)
Jesuitical Conspiracy.
and the Archbishop of Canterbury must be made away. This was conceived the
likeliest means to compass their Ends, and bring in that Religion they miscal
Catholic and Christian. For certainly such barbarous Murders and
Assassinations may possibly promote Turcism, and the Errors of Mahomet, (and if
you will, Popery) but never were (nor can be) any just means to propagate true
Christianity. This Traitorous Conspiracy to Murder Charles the First, and the
Archbishop, etc. was discovered (by an honorable Person) to the English
Ambassador in Holland, and (by him) to the Archbishop, and by him, to the King.
And the Original Copy of the Discovery, being found in the Archbishop's
Library, after his death, was then published, and is in Print, in many hands,
and (amongst others) in mine. In the mean time, our unhappy Civil Wars began;
and our Popish Conspirators, (animated by a belief of such Rebellious Doctrines
and Principles, as I have before mentioned, and encouraged and assisted by the
Pope) are first in Arms, and the bloody Rebellion; and (in Ireland) murdered
above 100000 Protestants in cold blood, without any provocation given, but to
kill Heretics, (which according to their impious and erroneous Principles,
was lawful and meritorious) and thereby promote the Catholic Cause. This is
notoriously known to both Kingdoms, ( England and Ireland.) And further, when
in the process of that fatal Rebellion, (carried on openly by English, and
covertly by Popish Rebels) that good King was taken, imprisoned, with design to
bring His Sacred Head to the Block, (for the distance is seldom great between a
Princes Prison and His Grave) our Popish Conspirators had a Council of Priests
and Jesuits, which sat in London, and signified the condition of their
Affairs here, to a Council of their Confederates at Paris, and they transmitted
the The Question put to the Sorbon (then almost wholly Jesuited) by our English
Jesuits, sent from London, was (in Writing) this: -- That seeing the State of
England was in a likely posture to change the Government, whether it was lawful
for the Catholics to work that change, for the advancing and securing the
Catholic Cause in England, BY MAKING AWAY THE KING, whom there was no hope to
turn from his Heresy? The Answer of the Sorbon was Affirmative. And at Rome it
was resolved by the Pope and his Council; That it was both LAWFUL and EXPEDIENT
for the Catholics to procure that Alteration of State, etc. Dr. Du Moulin in
his Book next cited.
Case to Rome, from whence Directions and Commands were returned (by the same
way) back again to London. In short, it was determined, that it was for the
Interest of the Catholic Cause, that the King should die; and accordingly
their Council of Priests and Jesuits in London Voted His Death* This is now
Notoriously known to be true, and (in Print) published to the By Dr. Du Moulin
in his Answer to Philanax Anglicus* (a Popish scandalous and lying Pamphlet)
and in another Tract since; neither of which I have here, and so cannot cite
(as in Books about me I do) the particular Pages.
World, by a Reverend and Learned Person, who, (if any shall call him to an
account for it) is so convinced of the truth of what he writ, that he ( in
scriplis) publicly offers, and promises to make it good. I do not hear, that
he has (as yet) been called to any account, to prove what he publicly, and in
Print, has professed and promised to do: Nor do I think, he will be called to
any such account, because I have reason to believe, that he can, and will
produce such Proofs, as will evidently demonstrate, both their bloody
Conspiracies, and the undeniable truth of what he affirmed.

6. By the Premises it may sufficiently appear, That the Rebellious Popish
Principles and Practices have been very dangerous to all our Protestant
Princes, and their Loyal Subjects, ever since the Reformation; and had they
taken that effect, which they designed, and with unwearied wickedness
industriously endeavored, they would have proved destructive and (both to
Prince and People pernicious. Nay, (which I have omitted) while this whole
Nation continued actually in the Communion of the Church of Rome; when Henry
the Eighth his Parliament and Convocation (all Roman-Catholiques, and far from
being Protestants) had denied and ( lege Statut. 24. Hen. 8. cap. 12. and 25.

will not (in Obedience to the Popes Command) expel him and them, out of the
Kingdom and their Dominions, all their Goods, (Moveable and Immovable) Moneys,
Merchandises, ( whether within or without England) are to be seized on, and (by
the Popes Authority) possessed and kept by any who can catch them. And he there
gives them (such Thieves and Robbers) full power to enjoy and possess such
Plundered Goods of the Kings or his Loyal Subjects, as in their own Right and
Propriety. And if they take any Inhabitants in England, (Native or Alien) who
Obey the King, and Disobey the Pope, then all so taken, are to be Slaves to
those who take them: So that impious Bull; in contradiction to the Laws of
Nature and Scripture, Reason and Christian Religion. Our Blessed Savior, (the
Prince of Peace) came not to destroy, but to save; not to Depose Kings and
Emperors, Absolve their Subjects from the Obligations of their Natural or Sworn
Allegiance, or to Arm them against Governors, and (as his pretended Vicar does)
promise them a Reward ( Remission of Sins here, and an higher place in Heaven
hereafter) for Rebellion, and Murdering their Brethren, Fellow Subjects and
Christians, for believing and maintaining that Truth, which by the Pope and his
Party, should be miscalled Heresy. No, he was the good Shepherd, who laid down
his own life for his Sheep; and when they strayed and erred from his Fold, he
did not hire and send Dogs or Wolves to worry them; but (with infinite Patience
and Mercy) went himself to seek them, and being found ( though erring and out
of his Fold) laid them on his own shoulders, and (with great love and labor)
brought them home to his Fold, from which (as his Sheep may, and yet not cease
to be his Sheep) they had erred. We read indeed, that our Blessed Savior gives
Peter Commission to Joh. 21. 15, 16.
FEED HIS SHEEP and his LAMBS. But we never read that he ( whose Kingdom was
not of this World) gave any Commission to Peter, or his pretended Vicar, to
raise Armies to kill, and ( indicta causa) to Murder them. Though I know there
are some, who from pasce oves, (with bad Logique and worse Divinity) conclude,
that the Pope has Power to kill Heretics. Like that Monk Erasmus mentions,
who, with great Zeal for the Catholic Cause, and greater Ignorance,
endeavored to prove, that the Church might kill Heretics, from that passage
in the Apostle, Tit. 3. 10.
HAERETICUM DEVITA, that is, (says the Monk) (who had no Greek, and little
Latin) DE VITA TOLL, take him out of this life, that is, kill him. Sed e
diverticulo in Viam.

7. From the aforesaid reasons, I think we may (with good consequence)
conclude; that the Pope and his party, ever since Henry the Eighth, (de facto)
assumed the Supremacy, which (de jure) was his before) have been in a perpetual
Conspiracy against the Lives and Religion of our Protestant Princes; at least
till the Happy Return of our Gracious Sovereign (whom God preserve) who being
(by the good and Miraculous Providence of Heaven Restored to His Fathers Throne
(His own Right and Inheritance) a blessed Peace, and all the happy effects of
it, did immediately follow, to the great comfort and benefit of the whole
Nation; The Government of Church and State before shattered and ruined by a
horrid Rebellion (Begun, Encouraged, and Promoted by the Pope and his
Jesuitical Party) was happily Restored, and (by Law) established; the Just
Rights and Liberties of the Subjects assured to them, and confirmed; a Gracious
Act of Oblivion, and Pardon of Illegal, Seditious and Rebellious actions
against the King and His Laws granted; and the blessing and benefit of all
these extended to Papists as well as other. So that beside their Obligation to
Obedience and Loyalty, by their Natural or Sworn Allegiance, there lay upon
them an Obligation to Gratitude, for those signal favors they received, from
the goodness of a gracious Prince. So that it was the belief and hope of some,
that the forementioned Popish Principles and Practices had been forgot, or laid
aside; and that the Roman Catholics (as both in words and writings they
publicly pretended) would be very Loyal Subjects But these were vain hopes;
for (notwithstanding all obligations to obedience and gratitude) even since His
Majesty's Happy Return, the Popish Party have carried on their Plots and
Conspiracies, against their gracious Prince, the established Religion, and the
Peace of our Church and State, with as much industry and impiety, as formerly.
Which now evidently appears, by their impious Conspiracy, by the blessing of
God very happily, though lately discovered. That you may (in the General) know
what this Plot is, and that I do not miscall it, when I say it is an Impious
Conspiracy: I shall give you two Authentic Testimonies.

I. Our gracious King calls it In His Majesty's Proclamation, for banishing all
Papists, Ten miles from London, Dated, October. 30. 1678.
A BLOODY TRAITOROUS design of POPISH Recusants, against His MAJESTY'S Sacred
PERSON, the GOVERNMENT, and the PROTESTANT RELIGION.

II. The House of Commons (in a Vote of that The Votes of the Commons was read
to the Lords, and by them approved at a Conference, 1 Nov. 1678.
House, approved by the Lords) say thus........ Resolved, etc. That this House
is of Opinion, that there HAS BEEN, and STILL IS, a DAMNABLE, and HELLISH
PLOT, contrived and carried on by POPISH RECVSANTS, for (horresco referens)
ASSASSINATING and MURDERING THE KING, and for SUBVERTING the GOVERNMENT, and
rooting out, and DESTROYING the PROTESTANT RELIGION.

By what is already said, (I suppose) you may see, what the Roman Catholic, or
Popish Principles and Practices have been, are, and (while there is a Pope, and
a Party to believe and encourage such Practices) ever will be; and how
dangerous such Principles are, and (when put in execution) how pernicious they
are (and ever will be) to all PRINCES, espeally PROTESTANTS, and all those they
are pleased to call, or miscall Heretics. Their received Principles I have
hitherto mentioned are these:

1. The Pope (with them) is Supreme MONARCH of all the World, even in
Temporals; at least indirecte, (as the most moderate amongst them sometimes
say) and in ordine ad spiritualis, which distinction can afford no comfort or
security to Temporal Princes. For if the Pope have such vast power, direct, or
indirecte, it is all one, he has it; and if a Prince be deposed, or murdered, by
either end of the distinction, he is equally, and as surely Murdered; as he who
is killed by the edge, or back of the Sword, is as certainly killed.

2. They say, the Pope has power to And this vast power the Pope challenges
over all King, and Emperors, to Excommunicate and Depose them, is such; that if
any King or Emperor obey not the Decree of the Pope and his Councils, he is,
ipso facto, deprived of all his dignity, and Goods, etc. It is not any private
person, but a General Council of their own, which tells us so.......... Omnibus
Christi fidelibus inhibet, sub p na PRIVATIONIS OMNIUM DIGNITATUM and BONORUM
Ecclesiasticorum and mundanorum, et ALIS P*AENIS juris: etiamsi REGALIS sit
dignitatis aut IMPERIALIS; quibus si contra HANC INHIBITIONEM fecerint, sint
AUTHORITATE HUJUS DECRETI, et IPSO FACTO PRIVATI, etc. Council. Constantiense.
S. ss. 38. In Senten. contra Benedictum. 13. Nay, if they be but negligent in
executing the Decrees of the Pope and his Council, they incur all those
punishments......... Si NEGLIGENS extiterit, cujuscunque dignitatis fuerit;
etiamsi IMPERIALIS, etc. il^as poenas IPSO FACTO incurr^t, qu^ in Constitut.

the words of the same Council of Constance, Sess. 39. In Provisione adversus

Excommunicate, Curse, and Damn Kings.

3. To depose and deprive them of all their Royal Power and Jurisdiction.

4. To absolve their Subjects from all Obligations (whether Natural, or
afterward arising from Oaths) to fidelity and obedience.

5. To Arm their Subjects against their Sovereigns, so deposed by the Pope,
their Supreme Judge, and (according to the professed Doctrine of the Jesuits,
Canonists,) etc. infallible too, In rebus facti and fidei.

6. That this taking of Arms against their King, (when deposed by the Pope) is
no Rebellion against their King; seeing (by their Traitorous Principles) as
soon as deposed, he ceases to be their Sovereign.

7. That, if in such a War, they kill their King, (especially if he be an
Heretic) it is no crime, no Homicide or Murder, but a Meritorious work, to
which the Pope has promised Plenary Indulgence, and Pardon of all their Sins,
and an higher place in Heaven.

8 Nay, (to give them the highest encouragements to commit all those Villainies,
Christians are capable of) they shall be reputed Martyrs, referred into their
Calendars in Red Letters, and (in their opinion) be esteemed great Saints in
Heaven, who in Earth were known to be Rebels to their Prince, and justly
Executed for High Treason. For so, as is before said and proved) those who (by
the Hand of Justice) perished for their Prodigious Villainy, in the
Gunpowder-Conspiracy, are reckoned for Martyrs in the Jesuits Martyrology.
Now, how dangerous such Principles (having such No less than 15000 Guineys
promised by the Jesuits, to one who should Assassinate our Gracious King; and
4000 to Murder Justice Godfrey: as appears by the Papers of the discovery of
the late horrid Conspiracy, and Mr. Bedlow's Confession.
Encouragements) may prove to all, especially Protestant Princes, do you and
the World Judge.

But (as to the danger of such Doctrines) this is not all, (though too much)
for it is not only a received Doctrine in the Roman-Church, That the Pope may
depose Kings and Emperors if they be Heretics, (as with them, we are sure all
Protestants are) but further,

I. That Subjects also (as well as the Pope) may lawfully depose their
Sovereigns, if they be Heretics. II. Nay, that they ought, and (both in Law
and Conscience) are strictly bound to depose their Princes if they be
Heretics. III. And their approved, and great Writers publicly confess, (in
their Books printed, and licensed by the Authority of their Church) that both
the former Propositions are approved by all Catholics. Sure I am, they have
not publicly been condemned by any Act, Decree or Sentence of their Church;
and therefore we have reason to believe, that they approve them. For, qui non
prohibet peccare cum possit, jubet.
For the proof of all this, I shall only give you two or three Testimonies of
their own (by public Authority) approved and licensed Authors, who expressly
say, and endeavor to prove, what here I have affirmed. 1. One of them
says........ OMNIUM CATHOLICORUM sententia, etc. Jos. Creswel in his
Philopater, Sect. ^. number. 160.
That it is the Opinion of ALL CATHOLICS, that Subjects ARE BOUND to depose
an Heretical KING. And he adds there....... Pr^cepto DIVINO and arctissimo
CONSCIENTIAE VINCULO, ac EXTREMO ANIMARUM suarum PERICULO, Haereticos Principes
DETURBARE Ibidem. (...). 162.
That they are BOUND, by the LAW of GOD, by the MOST STRICT BOND of CONSCIENCE,
and UTMOST PERIL of their SOULS, to DEPOSE HERETICAL PRINCES. And (their great
Controvertist, and Cardinal) Bellarmine, says as much; (and with more
authority) speaking of Heretical Princes......... Bellarmin. de Roman. Pontif.
lib. 5. cap. 7. Sect. Probatur.
OMNIUM CONSENSU (all Roman Catholics he means) possunt ac DEBENT privari suo

the PEOPLE (as well as the Pope) may declare, a King to be a Tyrant: and when

Roman-Catholique Religion, you may be sure he means) and then (by these
Jesuitical and Popish Principles) All Protestant Princes are Tyrants, and may

Popish Principles, are not only dangerous, but pernicious to all Protestant
Princes; who, (in their account) being Heretics, are consequently Tyrants,
and may be declared such by the People, and Murdered by any private Man.

I know that some Roman Catholics deny this Object.
Doctrine to be approved by the Church of Rome, and tell us; that the Church
has expressly condemned it as scandalous, and (both in faith and manners
erroneous: and for this they quote the Council. Constansiense Sess. 15. In
condemnatione illius Propositionis, Quilibet Tyrannus, etc.
Council of Constance. In answer to this I shall,

1. Set down the words of the Council. Solutio.
2. The Answer to them
1. The words of the Council are these; and the Proposition they condemn
this...... Quilibet Tyrannus potest ac debet licite ac meritorie occidi, per
quemlibet vassallum and subditum, etiam per insidias, vel blanditias, vel
adulationes non obstante quocunque Juramento seu confederatione factis cum eo,
non expectata sententia vel mandato Judicis cujuscunque. That is..... Any
Tyrant may, and ought to be lawfully and meritoriously killed, by any vassal or
subject of his, even by treachery or flattery; notwithstanding any oath, or
confederation made to, or with him; and not having the preceding sentence or
command of any Judge whomsoever.

2. This is the Proposition, which the Fathers at the They confess it to be
Concilium Generale approbatum, and a Gregorio Duodecimo Vero Pontifice,
confirmatum. Longus a Coriolano, in summa Council. p. 858. yet they reject what
displeases the Pope in it. Idem Ibidem.
General Council at Constance, condemned, (for a General approved Council, and
confirmed by a true Pope, they acknowledge it; though they have little reason
for it, as may appear by what ( b) Gesner has said, and Longus a Coriolano p.
866.
Longus a Coriolano has not (though he endeavor it) Answered.) But it is
penned with ( g) Gesnar. in Praefat. ad Epitomen Council. ex additis ad
Chronicon Urspergens.
that Art, and Roman Catholic cunning, that though it seem to say something
for the Security of Kings and Princes; yet indeed it is (as to that purpose)
altogether insignificant. For,

1. Here is nothing in this Proposition, or the Condemnation of it, by the
Council; which condemns, or any way disapproves the Popes Excommunications or
Depositions of Kings, their Absolutions of their Subjects from their Oaths of
Allegiance, or giving away their Dominions. It is only the Assassinations and
Murdering of Tyrants which are spoken of; not any Excommunications,
Depositions, etc. of Kings.

2. Nor does the Council deny, but that every TYRANT may be killed; but that
which they condemn as erroneous, is; That every Tyrant may, and also OUGHT to
be killed. Now this is a Conjunctive and Copulative Proposition; and such
Propositions are (in Logique) false, when either part is false, though both be
not. So this Proposition, Every Man is rational and Learned; is erroneous,
because one part is so: for though every Man be Rational, yet every Man is not
Learned. In like manner, although it will be granted at Rome, that every Tyrant
may be Killed; yet that every Tyrant ought to be Killed, will not be so easily
granted. For let him be a Tyrant in respect of Title, one who is an Usurper,
and has no right to the Crown; yet let him be a Roman Catholic, a zealous
Maintainer and Promoter of the Papal Religion and Interest; or one under whom
they find more favor than they did expect from the true King; they will not
say that he OUGHT to be Killed. And on this account it was (I believe) that the
Pope and his Party did not think, That CROMWELL (though a Tyrant) OUGHT to be
Killed; or (for ought I know) ever went about it; (though they desired and
endeavored to take away the Life of CHARLES the Martyr, who had a most just
Title to the Crown) because they found more favor under him, and more freedom
from the punishment of Penal Laws, than they ever had before; or could expect,
if the true Owner of it, possessed the Crown. In Cromwell's time, no Oaths of
Allegiance or Supremacy were pressed upon them, our Liturgy and Common Prayers
were taken away, and an Ordinance passed, That no Man should be Censured for
not coming to Church; so that there was no way then to discover, or legally
convict a Popish Recusant. On which ground, the Fathers at Constance, might
condemn this Proposition, (as erroneous) Quilibet Tyrannus etc. Every Tyrant
MAY, and OUGHT o be Killed; and not deny that every Tyrant MIGHT be Killed.

3. When they condemn this Proposition, (as erroneous)...... Every Tyrant may
LAWFULLY, and MERITORIOUSLY be Killed: on the same account the Proposition is
erroneous, and (as such) might be condemned by them; and yet they might believe
it LAWFUL to Kill any Tyrant, thought not Meritorious.

4. When they say, a Tyrant cannot lawfully be killed per Quemcunque Vassallum
and Subditum, by any of his Subjects; this is but poor comfort for Kings or
Pinces, and afford them no certain Security. For if a King be Killed, it is not
much material, whether a Native or an Alien be the Assassin, he is Killed. So
that notwithstanding all the Council of Constance has said; they may hire an
Alien to Kill a Protestant Prince, as Lopez was to Murder Queen Elizabeth; and
a Spaniard to Assassinate Maurice of Nassaw: or (what was really intended and
endeavored, and probably had taken effect, had not the good Providence of
Heaven miraculously hindered it) the Pope may give away our Nation, and send a
Spanish Armado, (as he did in Queen Elizabeth's time) or a French Army, to kill
Prince and People, and take possession of it. Dirum omen misericors (qui solus
potest) averruncet Deus.

5. When that Council denies this Proposition, (and condemns the Affirmative as
erroneous) That a Tyrant may be Murdered by any Vassal and Subject; it is in
the singular number, ( per Vassallum and Subditum) and hinders not, but that
more, or the major part of the Subjects and Commonweal may do it; for although
this Doctrine be impious and Heretical, yet (at Rome) it is Catholic, (or
Roman-Catholique) and by many of their eminent Writers, maintained and
justified.

6 But ^astly; This Sentence of their General Council of Constance, is so far
from proving that, for which it is produced; ( That the Church of Rome does not
approve the Depositions, or Assassinations of Kings) that it evidently proves
the direct contrary. That this may appear (and without any going back, or
trouble) to you; I shall put in the Quilibet Tyrannus potest, ac debet licite
ac meritorie occidi, per quemcunque Vassallum and Subditum, etiam per insidias,
blanditias vel adulationes, non obstante quocunque juramento aut corfederatione
factis cum eo. NON EXPECTATA SENTENTIA VEL MANDATO JUDICIS CUJUSCUNQUE Council.
Constant. ubi supra. Sess. 15.
Margent, the words of the Council of Constance, (though you have them before.)
Now in the words cited, it is evident; 1. That when they condemn the Killing of
Tyrants, NON EXPECTATA SENTENTIA AUT MANDATO JUDICIS, Not expecting the
Sentence o^ command of the Judge; there is some Judge whose sentence and
command should be expected. For it were ridiculous to talk of expecting the
sentence or command of a judge, if there were no such Judge, whose sentence
could be expected. 2. Now although to us, (and in truth) Kings and Supreme
Princes, neither have, nor can have any Judge: it being necessary, that the
Judge be Superior in Power and Jurisdiction, to the Person Judged, (otherwise
he cannot be a legal and competent Judge) and to say, That Kings and Supreme
Princes have any Superior on Earth, (where they are Supreme) is a
contradiction. 3. But at Rome, it is otherwise; the RomanCatholiques do
constantly affirm, That both the Pope and the People, are Superiors to Kings,
and may pass sentence on them, and declare them Tyrants. 4. And therefore if
Subjects may not kill Kings, (who are Tyrants) without such sentence or
command, but must expect it; then if thy have expected, and have it, then they
may kill them lawfully and meritoriously. For exceptio firmat regulam in non
exceptis. 5. And it is to be observed, that it is, Sententia vel Mandato
Judicis, by the Sentence or Command of the Judge. So that if any private Person
have the command of the Pope or People, (who are Regem (si Tyrannus declaretur
a PAPA vel POPULO) quilibet, etiam PRIVATUS, potest JURE PER^MERE. Mariana de
Rege and Regis Institut. Mogunt. 1605. p. 59, 60.
the Popish Judges in this case) or the Sentence of either of them, declaring
any King to be a Tyrant; then this is Warrant enough (by their impious Popish
Politiques) for any private Person to kill such a King. From which
Roman-Catholique Doctrine, it evidently follows, that when (in our late Civil
Wars, and unhappy Rebellion) the Parliament had declared CHARLES the Martyr a
Tyrant, any particular Person (without Erecting an High Court of Justice, as
they miscalled it) might lawfully have Murdered him. 6. It is to be further
observed, that (by their Popish Principles) Tyranny and Heresy in Kings, are
crimes equally deserving Deposition and Death; and every Tyrannus est, qui
SACRA PATRIA pessundat. Ibid. p. 60. That is, qui sacra Papistica, and
Religionem Romano-Catholicam, (quantum in se est) supprimit, and extirpat.
Heretical King is a Tyrant with them. Whence it follows, 1. That if the Pope
command any one to kill a Protestant (or which with them is all one, an
Heretical) Prince; then (according to this Decree and Doctrine of the Council
of Constance) he may lawfully do it. 2. Or if he give no such command, but pass
a definitive Sentence against any such Prince, and in a Damnatory Bull declare
him an Excommunicate and Deposed Heretic; (or In all their Excommunications
of Heretics, the style is usually this -- Anathematizamus omnes Haereticos,
eorum FAUTORES, and generalit^^* quoslibet illorum DEFENSORES, etc. Bulla
Coenae. Sect. 1. In Bullario Romano, Lugd. 1673. Tom, 5. p. 528.
Favorer of them) then any private Person has sufficient Warrant and Authority
to Murder him. So that when Pope Pius the Fifth had Excommunicated Queen
Elizabeth, (by this their Popish Divinity) any one of her Subjects might
(without any further Authority, or fault) have Murdered her. Now whether such
Principles as these, be not dangerous, inconsistent with Loyalty, and (to
Protestant Princes) pernicious, let the World judge. Sure I am, our Kings (and
Parliaments) knowing (by sad experience) the fatal and pernicious Consequences
of such Popish Principles, have publicly declared this their sense and
detestation of them. I shall give an Instance or two.

1. Our Gracious King, (in a Proclamation) having spoken of the Intestine
Divisions amongst us, it follows:....... Proclamation dated at White^all, 16
Jan. 1673. and you have it in the Gazette, Number. 853.
Which are CHIEFLY OCCASIONED by the Undermining Contrivances of POPISH
RECUSANTS, whose Numbers and INSOLENCES are of late GREATLY increased, and
whose RESTLESS PRACTICES threaten SUBVERSION to the CHURCH and STATE. The
restless Practices are the mischievous Consequents of their impious Principles.

2. A full Statut. Anno 25 Hen. 8. cap. 22. which was Ann. Christ. 1533. and he
was not Excommunicated till the year 1538. Magnum Bullarium Roman. Lugd. 1655.
Tom. 1. p. 704.
Parliament, (and a Popish one too) takes notice of, and condemns the Papal
Usurpations, in taking upon them to dispose of inheritances and Kingdoms, in
these words:.......... The Pope, CONTRARY to the inviolable Grants of
Jurisdictions BY GOD IMMEDIATELY to Emperors and Kings, has PRESUMD to invest
who should please him, to inherit in other Men's Kingdoms and Dominions: which
we your Loyal Subjects SPIRITUAL and TEMPORAL, ABHOR and DETEST. Such were
the Popes Usurpations then; but (as in Parliament they confess) abhorred and
detested by Clergy and Laity. But now (as evidently appears by the lately
discovered damnable Conspiracy) the Pope and his Party, take upon them to
Murder our Gracious King, (whom God preserve) and dispose of His Kingdoms.
Which Practices, and Principles which cause and encourage them, I do (and
justly may) call Dangerous, and (when they take effect, which I hope they never
will) Destructive and Pernicious.

And here further, because many of our Popish Party, seeing the horridness of
this Damnable and Hellish Conspiracy, and (in reality I hope, or at least) seem
to condemn both it, and the Authors of it; laying the blame upon the Persons
only of some few, and with great confidence, (to give it no worse name) denying
the Roman Church to approve, or receive any Principles, which can encourage
such Conspiracies, or prove pernicious, or dangerous to Princes, their Persons,
or Government: I shall briefly give you an account of some more of their
received Doctrines and Principles, (besides those already named) which have
been, and (while they are believed) ever will be prejudicial to Princes, and
the Peace and Quiet of their Subjects and Dominions. For instance,

1. The Church of Rome expressly declares it unlawful for Secular Princes to
require any Oath of Fidelity or Allegiance of their Clergy; and as expressly
forbids all their Clergy to take any such Oath, if it be required...... Council.
Lateran. Magnum sub Innocentio 3. Can. 43. Vid. Baronium Annal. Tom. 10. ad
Annum 858. Sect. 49. page 155.
Nimis d^ Jure DIVINO quidam LAICI Usurpare cenantur, cum Viros Ecclesiasticos

personis SECULARIBUS praestare cogantur hujusmodi Juramentum, etc. This is the
Constitution of their great and Ecumenical Council under Innocent the Third,
and is referred into the Body of their Canon Cap. Nimis. 30. Extra De

confirmed by Pope Gregory the XIII. So that by the Popish Canons, and their
approved and received Laws, no Secular Prince may require any Oath of
Allegiance and Fidelity, of any of the Clergy, or Ecclesiastiques, nor are the
Clergy to take any such Oaths. And if a Clergyman should take any such Oath,
it is (by their Canon Law) for several reasons, declared null, and not
obligatory. For, 1. They tell us, That no Oath which is against the Juramentum
contra utilitatem Ecclesiasticam prastitum NON TENET. Lemma ad cap. Sicut. 27.
Extra De Jurejurando.
Ecclesiastical Utility, and Benefit of the Church, is valid and binding: Nay,
the Law it self there says, That all such Oaths against Ecclesiastical Utility,
are not Oaths properly, but Non jurament^ sed perjuria potius dicenda, quae
contra utilitatem Ecclesiasticam, etc. dicto cap. Sicut. 27.
Perjurics. And the case is put in their Law, of a Prince, who fearing some
Princeps timens conspirationes aliquas fieri contra eum. Juramentum extorsit,

CONSPIRACY against him, took an Oath of some, that they should not (for the
future) be in any Conspiracy against him. They who had taken this Oath, desired
to know how far they were bound by this Oath? And that Law, and Innocent the
Third, gives this Answer, Declaramus, vos Juramento hujusmodi NON TENERI, quin
pro juribus and honoribus Ecclesiae, and vestris, legitime defendendis, CONTRA
IPSUM PRINCIPEM stare libere valeatis.
That they were not so bound by that Oath, but that they might stand against
the Prince (to whom they had so Sworn) in the lawful defense of the rights and
honors of the Church and their own. Now it is certain, that the Pope (with them)
is the sole Supreme Judge in all Ecclesiastical Causes; (and such this is,
concerning the Rights and Honors of the Church) and therefore if he Judge (as
we are sure he will) that our Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, be against
the Rights and Honor of that Church, of which he pretends to be the Head;
neither those, nor any such Oaths will be obligatory to any of his party; at
least they will think them not to be so; and so they will think, that
(notwithstanding any such Oath) they may, for the benefit of the Church, and
the Catholic Cause, oppose and conspire against their Prince. 2. It is a Rule
in their Dictum juramentum excusare non potest, in quo debet intelligi jus
superioris exceptum. Innocentius. 3. cap. Venientes. 19. extra. De jurejurando.
Law (and in reason too) That in all Oaths, it must be understood, that the
right of the Superior is excepted, and must be preserved. So if a Tenent Swear
Fealty to his Landlord, how great soever (so he be a subject) it must be, salvo
jure dominii principalis; the Royal Rights of his Prince, must not, cannot be
prejudiced by that Oath. This is true in Thesi. Now we know, that the Pope (and
his party who acknowledge him) thinks that he is far superior to all Kings; and
therefore if he think and declare (as we know he has done) that our Oaths of

his party will think them binding. 3. If they were confessed to be obligatory;
yet they of the Popish Church, believe he can dispense Papa secundum

valid. Nor is it any wonder, if the Pope dispense with Oaths (voluntary or
involuntary) if it be true, which John Semeca the Glossator there tells
us....... That the Pope can dispense against the LAW OF Dico (says the Gloss)
Quod contra JUS NATURAL potest dispensare and contra APOSTOLUM. Gloss. Ibid.
NATURE, and against the APOSTLE. And that we might take notice of it, those
words (in the Edit. Paris. 1522.
old Editions of the Canon Law) are put in the Margent...... Papa contra
Apostolum dispensat: the Pope dispenses against the Apostle. And in the latter
Edit. Paris. 1612.
Editions of that Law with the Gloss (even those confirmed by Pope Gregory the
Thirteenth, as most Correct, and purged from Errors) they are so far from
disowning that irrational and impious Gloss; that (in a Note there in the
Margent) they explain and justify it..... It is not absurd (says the Non est
absurdum Papam dispensare contra Apostolum quoad jus positivum. Nota ad Glossam
ad dictum Can. ^. verbo Absolvimus.
Author of that Note) for the Pope to dispense against the Apostle, as to
positive Law. So that Papists may take as many Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy as their Prince shall please, yet the Pope (when he pleases) can
dispense with them, and set them free, from all obligation of fidelity. And
hence it evidently follows; That a true Roman-Catholique (who believes this
Popish Power of dispensing with all Oaths) may take a thousand Oaths of
Allegiance, and yet give no assurance of his Fidelity to his Prince; seeing the
Pope may (upon their approved Principles) when he pleases, set them free from
all such Obligations. 4. But, if all these ways, of nulling the Obligations of
Oaths of Allegiance fail: yet the Popes Janissaries (the Jesuits) have a new
way to prevent all such Obligations of Oaths, without any Dispensations; and
that is by Equivocations, rectifying Intentions, and their Doctrine of
Probabilities: pernicious Errors, destructive of Humane Society, and so
notoriously now known to the World, that I neither shall, nor need go about to
prove them, or show the pernicious consequences of them. Sure I am, that by
their Popish Principles, no Papists in England are As may (to omit all others)
abundantly appear by Father Parsons Book writ against the Oath of Allegiance:
The Title of his Book is this, A Discussion of the Answer of Dr. Will. Barlow.
And at large lately in Father Caron's Remonstrantia Hibernorum, etc.
permitted to take the Oath of Allegiance to their King: and then it is easy to
judge, what good Subjects they are like to be. For certainly, what I may
lawfully do, that (on a just and serious occasion) I may swear to do. If it be
a duty, and lawful for me to obey my Princes commands, and pay him fidelity;
then certainly, I may (by Oath) bind my self to the performance of it. So all
Men, by the Law of Nature and Moral Veracity, are bound to speak truth; it is
both lawful and a duty: and therefore, when (in Judicature) I am called to be a
Witness; I may, and (by the consent of all Nations) ought to take an Oath, to
bind me, and assure others, that I will speak truth. All Men (as I said, and
all confess) are bound by an indispensable Law of Nature to speak truth (when
there is a just occasion for it) and yet (in Judicature) his testimony would
not pass for good evidence, who (being required) would not (by Oath) confirm
the truth of it. And therefore Princes have just reason to believe, that those
who will not take an Oath to be Loyal Subjects, will never be so without it.
And indeed the reason why Princes may justly suspect the fidelity of their
Popish Clergy, who refuse the Oath of Allegiance, will farther appear, if we
consider,

2. That when and where Popery prevails, all their Bishops swear absolute
Allegiance and Fidelity to the Pope, and therefore cannot swear it to their
Prince too. The Oath every Popish Bishop must take at his Consecration, is
this... Ego N. ab hac hora in antea, fidelis and obediens ero..... Domino N.

them to retain and defend the Popedom, and THE Here it is REGALIA Sancti
Petri. But this is an Addition to the Oath (which was bad enough before) for
anciently it was REGULAS SANCTORUM Patrum. As their own Canon Law assures us.
Cap. Ego. N. 4. Extra de Jurejurando,
ROYALTIES of St. Peter, against ALL MEN.....I will carefully conserve, defend,
and promote the rights, honors, privileges, and authority of the Pope. I will
not be in any Counsel, Fact, or Treaty, in which any thing prejudicial to the
persons, rights, or power of the Pope is contrived: and if I shall know any
such things treated of, by ANY WHOMSOEVER, I will (to the utmost of my power)
hinder them, and with all possible speed signify them to the Pope.... I will
(to the UTMOST OF MY POWER) observe the POPES COMMANDS, and MAKE OTHERS observe
them. I will impugn and PERSECUTE HERETICS, and REBELS to my LORD THE POPE. I
will come to the Synod, WHEN HE CALLS ME, etc. This, and much more such stuff,
you have in that Oath. Now this is evidently an Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity
to the Pope. Wherein (to omit other things) they swear, 1. Never to discover
the Popes Counsels (how treasonable soever) TO ANY MAN, (not the King.) 2. To
defend the Popes ROYALTIES, against ALL MEN, (the King not excepted.) 3. And if
any thing be treated of prejudicial to the Pope, BY ANY WHOMSOEVER, (the King
not excepted) they swear, ( TO THE UTMOST OF THEIR POWER) to oppose and hinder
it. Here is (you see) an Oath of absolute Allegiance to the Pope, which cannot
consist with that Homage and Allegiance, or Fidelity, which not only at
present, but anciently, even in times of Popery, all the Bishops of England
did, and solemnly swore to their King, as a Vide Hen. Bracton, De Legibus

their Consecration, took no Oath at all to the Pope, but only promised him

and subjection to his Metropolitan: But with this difference. To the Pope he

But to the Metropolitan he only promises (but swears to neither of them) Fidem
and obedientiam exhibere. But to let this pass: It is manifest, that whenever

possible, that these persons who do, and must Swear such absolute obedience and
fidelity to the Pope, can be faithful and loyal subjects to their Prince? and
indeed, are not such Popish Principles both dangerous, and especially to
Protestant Princes pernicious, and inconsistent with the Loyalty of Subjects,
or safety of Supreme Powers? nor is this all; there is more danger yet to Kings
and Princes, from their Popish Principles. For,

Laymen (the King and Parliament of England) lay any Tax, or (by a Statute)
require any Subsidy of Clergymen, (though in the Necessities of the Kingdom)
without the Popes leave; such Statute is declared Void and Null, and they and
their Successors (unless satisfaction be made) Excommunicate. Nor is it only
some Inferior Magistrates or Officers, who are thus Excommunicated; but all

such Excommunications are not a rash and inconsiderate Act of Urban the Fifth,
or some angry Pope, they have been, (for some Ages past) and still are solemnly
published at Rome, every Year, in that famous and impious Bulla Coenae Domini,
on Maundy-Thursday. (Even on that day, in which our Blessed Savior Instituted
that Coen^ Domini, as a Sacrament of our Union with him, by a lively Faith, and
of the Communion of all Christians amongst themselves, by an unfeigned love and
charity. I say, on this day, the greatest part of the Christian World, are
Anathematized and Cursed at Rome, by their Popes successively, for no other
reason but because they are for the Truth of the Gospel, and against his
(without any reason or sense) Usurped Greatness and Worldly Interest.) In that
Bull, the Anathema, or Papal Curse (Stilo Curiae) is thus: Qui Collectas,
Tallias, praestantias, and alia onera personis Ecclesiasticis, and eorum,

this (aforesaid) were evidence enough to entitle the Church of Rome to such

evidence; I mean, their Great Lateran Council. Lateran. sub Innocentio Papa 3.

approved Doctrine and Principles of the Roman Church) no Kings, Princes or
Parliaments, nor any LAYMEN, (how many or great soever) can lay any Tax upon
Ecclesiastiques, (no not in the greatest Necessity and Poverty of the
Lay-Subjects) without express leave first had from the Pope. Now whether this
Popish Doctrine, (if approved and believed) be not very dangerous and
pernicious, (especially to Protestant Princes) do you judge. Nor is this all;
for,

4. Their approved and received Popish Principles, do not only free them, from
taking Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and their Estates (I speak of their
Clergy) from Taxes, (unless the Pope consent) but their Persons also, (be their
Crimes never so great) from all Punishment by Kings, or any Lay-Court or
Magistrate of what State or Dignity soever. This is a manifest and known Truth,
and needed no proof, were it not, that some, who have an ungrounded courage to
believe such Seditions Principles, have also (when it makes for their Interest)
a confidence to deny them. But, seeing some of the Popish Party do deny it, I
shall endeavor to bring such Authentic and evident Proofs, as will (I hope)
satisfy you, and might convince the Gainsayers (if they can and will
impartially judge) of the Truth of the aforesaid Popish Position. The Proofs I
mean, shall be drawn from the clear Testimonies of their own eminent and
learned Writers, their Canon-Laws, approved and received in and by their
Church, their Popes Decretals, and their own General Councils. And here,

1. An eminent Popish Excommunicantur QUICUNQUE Magistratus, qui contra

General Council, owned and approved by them.

2. We have a Canon of a Council at Paris, referred into the Body of their Law,
published by the Authority of Pope Gregory the Ninth, which determines the case
thus Cap. Nullus Judicum 2. Extra. De ^oro competenti: Judex SECULARIS, si
Clericum per se distrinxit, vel condemnat, excommunicari debet. That Is the
Lemma to the Chapter in which it is more fully expressed.
No SECULAR JUDGE may distrain or condemn ANY CLERGYMAN, without the
PERMISSION of the POPE: and if he do, he is to be excommunicate; and to
continue so, till he acknowledge and mend his fault. You see this Seditious
Popish doctrine is established by the Council of Paris, and the General Council
in the Lateran: and by 3 Popes (Innocent the Second, Gregory the Ninth, and In
his Bull approving and confirming the Canon Law. D^t. Romae 1 Julii, 1580.
Gregory the Thirteenth) and so must be the Doctrine of the Roman-Church. For
it is Law with them; NEMINI permissum est de eo quod PAPA STATUIT JUDICARE, vel
sententiam ejus retractare. So Pope Nicolas tells us in Gratian. Can. Nemini 3.
Cause. 17. Quaest. 4.
That NO MAN must be permitted to RETRACT, or QUESTION any Papal Sentence. And
their Law says further; Omnes sanctiones Apostolisae sedis irrefragabiliter
sunt observandae. That Is the Lemma or Title, and the Canon follows -- Sic omnes
Apostolicae sedis sanctiones accipiendae sunt, tanquam ipsius DIVINI PETRI VOCE
FIRMATAE. Can. Sic omnes. 2. Did. 19.
That ALL the Popes Decrees are IRREFRAGABLY to be observed; and that so far,
and undoubtedly, as if St. Peter had confirmed them with his own mouth: and
Gratian cites Pope Agatho for it.

3. Nay further, all Secular Magistrates, are (at Rome) every year, solemnly
Anathematized and cursed; Qui personas Ecclesiasticas ad suum Tribunat,
Audientiam, Cancellariam, PARLIAMENTUM, Consilium, etc. tr^^ant, aut trahi
faciant direct vel indirecte carcerando, vel molestando, etc. Vide Bullam
Clementis Papae 10. Dat. Romae 3 April 1671. In Bullario Romano. Lugd. 1673.
Tom. 5. page 530. Sect. 14, 15, 16.
who call any Ecclesiastical persons to their Tribunals, Courts, Chancellaries,
Councils, Parliaments, etc. or any way molest them directly or indirectly; for
it is but six or seven years since Pope Clement the Tenth did solemnly curse
all secular Magistrates and all Courts (even Parliaments) who should any way
trouble the Clergy, or punish, or take any cognizance of their crimes. So that
by this Popish Doctrine, our gracious King, his great Council (the Parliament)
and all our Courts in Westminster, stand now accursed, and (till they become
Papists and Slaves to the Pope, which cursed day, I hope will never come) that
curse will be continued, and every year solemnly and impiously renewed; and I
am persuaded that a greater curse cannot befall this Nation, than that which
will procure a Popes absolution, and free us from his Curse.

4. In a word, the Trent Cause crimina^es graviores contra Episcopos, ab ipso

exemption of their Clergy and Ecclesiastiques, from the Jurisdiction of all
Secular powers; The greater Crimes of the Bishops, (say the Trent-Fathers, in

now cited) can be examined and punished ONLY BY THE POPE; and their lesser
crimes, ONLY BY THE COUNCIL of Bishops. No lay-Judge or Judicature how great
soever, (nor Kings, nor Parliaments) must meddle with them; they may securely
sin, and need not fear any punishment by any Secular power. How dangerous and
pernicious this must needs be to all Secular supreme powers, let the world
judge. Certainly (upon these Popish principles) all the Clergy must and will
much rather fear and obey the Pope who can, than their Princes, who (by their
principles) have no power to punish them. But this is not all; for (to omit all
other) there is one pernicious Popish principle more, not yet mentioned, which
absolutely abrogates and deprives Princes and Kings of all their Regal power,
as to the Clergy. For,

Lastly, It is a constantly approved and received Doctrine at Rome, (though
evidently impious and traitorous) That the Clergy and Ecclesiastiques, are NONE
OF THE KINGS SUBJECTS. If this be not true, (as sure enough it is not) then
their Popish Canons are erroneous, (as you shall see anon) and their General
Councils and Popes, so far from being infallible, that they are actually and
evidently false: For both their Canon Law, their Councils, (even General ones)
and their Popes in their Decrotal Epistles (as by the following Testimonies
will appear) have approved, received, and by their authority (so far as they
are able) established and confirmed this rebellious and Popish principle. But
(on the other side) if they approve and acknowledge this Principle to be true,
(as constantly they do) then they approve a Doctrine which is not only
dangerous, but pernicious to Princes, which dethrones and unkings them, (as to
all their Clergy and Ecclesiastiques:) for if they be not Subjects to any
Secular Prince, then it is evident, that no such Prince can be their King; it
being impossible, that any man should be King of such persons, who are none of
his Subjects. And although this Popish principle be erroneous and traitorous,
against the light of Nature and Scripture, Reason and Revelation; yet it is not
all. For they do not only say, that the CLERGY ARE NONE OF THE KINGS SUBJECTS:
But (which is more erroneous and irrational) they do expressly say, that THE
CLERGY ARE SUPERIOR TO THE KING, and HE THEIR SUBJECT. That both these Popish
Positions may appear to be approved by, and generally received in the Church of
Rome; I desire you seriously to consider these following Testimonies.

Canonici, cum Glossis. Paris. 1612.
Canon Law) further tells us, (out of Ptolemy) that the Sun is greater than the
Moon 7744 times; and so (by this their Account) the Pontifical Power is no less
than 7744 times greater than the Imperial; and then there is no doubt, but in
their opinion who believe all this, the Emperor and all Kings must be the Popes
Subjects, and they no way superior to him.

2. Pope Martin the Fifth cites the Decretal of Pope Innocent the Third, and
more fully explains the meaning of it; approves Cap. Ad reprimendas 3. De Foro
competenti. In 7. Edit. Juris Canonici. Lugd. 1661.
and confirms it, and both their Decretals are now referred into the body of
their Law (where Pope Martins Decretal was not before:) The Lemma, or Title to
the Chapter before cited, is this L^^icis in Clericos NULLA POTESTAS, etc.
Lemma ad dictum Caput.
.......... Laymen have NO POWER OVER CLERGYMEN, etc. And the Decretal it self
says Non attendentes, quod LAICIS in CLERICOS, ECCLESIASTICAS personas, aut
EORUM BONA, NULLA sit attributa POTESTAS. Ibid. Capite dicto.
............ That LAYMEN have NO AUTHORITY over the Clergy, ECCLESIASTICAL

3. Cardinal Cajetan, who (his great Learning, and eminent place in Government
of that Church considered) could not be ignorant what Positions were approved
at Rome, tells us Persona CUJUSLIBET CLERICI est SANCTA quoad hoc, quod NON
POTEST SUBJICI POTESTATI SECULARI; and is qui contrarium faciat, SACRILEGUS

much more to the same purpose, we have in those 2 Titles. 1. De soto

......... That the Person of EVERY CLERGYMAN, was SACRED thus far, that he
COULD NOT BE SUBJECT to any SECULAR POWER.

4. Nay, a whole Learned College assures us, of the truth of the 3
Propositions. 1. KINGS 1. Reges non habent potestatem coactivam in
Ecclesiasticos. 2. Ecclesiastici non possunt conveniri, nisi coram superiori
suo Ecclesiastico* 3. EXEMPTIO CLERICORUM, est ex OMNIUM SENTENTIA, de Jure

have NO COACTIVE POWER over ECCLESIASTICS. 2. ECCLESIASTICS cannot be sued,
or called to an account, before any, save only THEIR ECCLESIASTICAL Superior.
3. The EXEMPTION of the Clergy, is IN THE JUDGMENT OF ALL (all Papists they
mean) of DIVINE RIGHT; so that they cannot be JUDGED, or PUNISHED by any
SECULAR, no NOT SUPREME POWERS. And here I desire you to consider; (what the
College of Bononia here affirms) that the Ecclesiastiques (Secular and
Regular) are, in the opinion of ALL ROMAN* CATHOLICS, by the LAW OF GOD, so
Vid. cap. Et quia 4. extra. De foro competenti. in 7. where the Title, or
Lemma, is this -- Constitutiones editae contra Principes Seculares,
Jurisdictionis Ecclesiasticae libertatem impedientes, Innovantur. And in the
Chapter, it is declared; 1. Quod Laicis in Clericos, and personas
Ecclesiasticas, and bona Ecclesiastica, non est attributa potestas. 2. And then
it follows -- REGES, DUCES, MARCHIONES, etc. in virtute Sanctae OBEDIENTIAE
MANDANTES, ut ipsi constitutiones praedictas observent -- Si Dei offensam, and
SEDIS APOSTOLICAE vitare voluerint ULTIONEM. Kings cannot meddle with any
Ecclesiastical Persons; if they do, they offend God, and shall be punished by
the Pope: that is, Excommunicated. So says the Pope, and his Lateran Council,
Cap. 2. De Invas^r. and Occup. Bon. Ecclisie, in 7. Decretalium.
exempted from the Jurisdiction of all Secular, (even SUPREME) POWERS, that
they can neither Judge, nor punish them. Whence it evidently follows, 1. That
the Popish Clergy, wherever they are (especially in England, and Protestant
Kingdoms) are no Subjects of that King, in whose dominions they live, because
they are (by the Law of God) exempt from all Secular Jurisdiction: It being a
contradiction to say, that any Man is a King in respect of those, over whom he
has no Jurisdiction. And, 2. It follows, that this impious and traitorous
Doctrine and Position, is not the opinion of some one, or a few private
persons, but of ALL ROMAN-CATHOLIQUES; and so of their Popish Church; and then
their Church (by their own Confession) is guilty of maintaining and approving
such dangerous, and to all (especially Protestant) Kings, Pernicious
Principles. Q. E. D.

5. But we have greater Authority (than that of the College of Bononia) to
manifest the truth of what we say, when we accuse the Popish Church for
approving and maintaining this impious and pernicious Doctrine; That their
Ecclesiastiques are not the Kings Subjects. I mean the Inquisitors of Index
Expurgatorius Hispanicus, Madriti, Anno 1667. in Johanne Chrysostom. page 703.
Spain and Index Expurg. Lusitan. Olysip. 1624. page 753.
Portugal, etc. who finding in the Index of Chrysostom, Edit. Basil. 1558.
words expressing this proposition Sacerdotes etiam Principibus Jure Divino
subditi.
PRIESTS, BY THE LAW OF GOD, ARE SUBJECT TO PRINCES; they (knowing that
Position to be inconsistent with the Exemptions of their Popish Clergy) damn
that Proposition, and command it to be blotted out: Deleantur illa verba (say
they) though Chrysostom say the very same thing, in the place to which the
Index refers. Now it is evident, that they who damn this Proposition (as
erroneous) PRIESTS by the Law of God, are subject to Princes; must (of
necessity) approve and affirm the contradictory; That Priests, by the Law of
God ARE NOT subject to Princes: which is that rebellious Position, with which
the Church of Rome is justly charged.

6. Lastly, the principal Authorities I have brought to prove this (or any of
the former Rebellious Doctrines charged on the Church of Rome) have been, 1.
Their approved, and (by Public Authority of their Church) received and
established Laws. 2. Their Popes Bulls, Decretals and Constitutions. 3. Or the
Canons of their Provincial, National, or General Councils: All which are
approved, innovated, and confirmed expressly, in their Trent Council. Trident.

sworn to approve, receive, and (without all doubting) to profess all those
Canons and Papal Constitutions, and, to Anathematize, Reject, and Curse all
contrary Opinions, and to endeavor (as much as in them lies) that all
committed to their care, shall constantly hold and teach the same.

The Premises impartially considered, I think two things may, and will
evidently follow:

1. That the Principles and Positions before mentioned, are not only dangerous,
but pernicious to all Supreme Powers; (especially to Protestant Kings and
Princes) and that in one thing omitted before; that is; That Faith is not to be
kept with Heretics, but that any competent Ecclesiastical Judge, may condemn,
and execute Heretics, (or those who are reputed such) notwithstanding any
SAFE CONDUCT given them, BY THE EMPEROR, KINGS, or SECULAR PRINCES, though
confirmed by OATH; and this impious, and (to Supreme Powers) pernicious
Doctrine, approved, and publicly declared and professed; not only by
particular, and private persons, but by their own General Quod non obstantibus
salvis Conductibus IMPERATORIS, REGUM, and SECULI PRINCIPUM, QUOCUNQUE VINCULO

and executed Jerome of Prague, and John Hus, notwithstanding the Emperors Safe
Conduct, without which they would not have come to that Council. To which we
may add, that those Fathers of Constance (it will highly concern Protestant
Princes to consider it) Synodically define, and declare, That all Heretics,
(that is all they call, and commonly miscal Heretics) all their defendors, or
favorers, etc. of what dignity soever, OMNES and singulos Haereticos, nec non
eorum sectatores u^riusque sex^s; and etiam defendentes eosdem, vel ipsis
quomodolibet, public vel occulte participantes; etiam si REGALI, REGINALI,
DUCALI aut alia QUAVIS DIGNITATE Ecclesiastica aut mandan^ praefulgeant; -- per
Excommunicationis, and PRIVATIONIS bonorum ac dignitatum secularium, and alias
paenas etiam per captiones and INCARCERATIONES puniantur. Council. Constansien^.
Sess. 45.
( Kings, and Queens, and Dukes, etc.) shall be Excommunicated and deprived of
all their Goods, and Secular Dignities. This ( in Thesi) is their impious
Doctrine and Principle; and ( in Praxi) they are now endeavoring to put it in
execution here in England; as evidently appears by their Popish and Hellish
Conspiracy, by the Gracious and Powerful Providence of Heaven, lately and
happily discovered. I take it then to be evident, that the aforesaid Popish
Doctrines and Principles are exceeding dangerous, and to all Supreme Powers
(especially Protestant Kings and Princes) pernicious.

2. And from the Premises, it will as evidently follow, that the aforesaid
Popish Principles, are not the private Opinions of some particular Persons
only: seeing, 1. They are professed and vindicated by the Jesuits, Canonists,
and generally by other great Writers of that Church, in their Books published
with the Approbation and Commendation of Authority. 2. Established in their
approved and received Canon Law. 3. In the Authentic Decretal Epistles, and
Papal Constitutions. 4. In their General Councils; those (I mean) which they
acknowledge to be General. 5. And (to say no more) all their Clergy and
Ecclesiastiques, (who have place in those Councils) have taken a Solemn Oath to
maintain all those Canons, and Papal Constitutions; and this Oath required and
taken by the Authority and Command of the Vide Council. Trident. Sess. 24. Cap.
12. de Reformat. and Annotat. Joh. Sotealli Theologi, and Horatii Lutii,

Supreme Judge, and (since the Councils of Pisa, Constance and Basil, declared
by Pope Leo the Tenth, and his Lateran Council, (which they account a General
Council) to be above all General Councils: and this Declaration (that all might
know it is Law and Obligatory) has lately been Cap. Pastor. 1. Extra De
Concilii^, in Septimo. And in the same place, Cap. Sicut. 3. and Cap.
Benedictus. 4. The same Doctrine is confirmed by Pope Pius. 4.
referred into the Body of their Canon Law. Now these things being undeniably
true, that their Popes and General Councils (the Supreme Authority of their
Church) have approved and received the aforesaid Principles and Positions, and
caused their Ecclesiastiques solemnly to swear, That they do believe, and will
constantly profess them, and (so far as they are able) make all committed to
their charge, do so too; it evidently follows, that they are Roman Catholic
Doctrines, owned and approved by their Church, and not only by private and
particular persons. So that if any (who knows, and has impartially considered
the Premises) deny it; I shall not call him Impudent, but I may (and must) say,
he has a hard Forehead, and a little thing will not make him blush.

To conclude; If that Priest, or Popish Gentleman, (you mention) who so
confidently denies the Church of Rome to approve such Principles, as I have
laid to her charge; can (as to the sum and substance of the Testimonies here
cited; for I neither need, nor will undertake for every particular
Circumstance, or Typographical Error) either show,

1. That I have misquoted the Authors and Books I cite, and that such Passages
do not occur in the places quoted. 2. Or (if they do occur) that I have mistook
their meaning, as to the purposes for which they are produced. 3. Or (if
neither of these can be shown) if he can make it appear, that the Church of
Rome has (by any public Act or Declaration) disowned such pernicious
Principles and Positions, and damned them as erroneous, and (what they really
are) impious: I do hereby promise him, that I will be (what I hope I never
shall be) one of the worst sort of Christians in the World, I mean a
Roman-Catholique. Farewell.
Your Faithful Friend, T. L.
