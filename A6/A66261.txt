WHereas We have received Information, That diverse Seamen and Mariners, who
have been Hired and Imprested in Our Service, and do belong to Our Ships of
War, do absent themselves from Our said Ships, and betake themselves on Board
several Merchant Ships and Vessels, with an intent to depart out of this Our
Kingdom without Our Royal License in that behalf first obtained, We have
thought fit, by and with the Advice of Our Privy Council, to Publish this Our
Royal Proclamation; And We do hereby Require and Command all and singular
Seamen, Mariners, and Seafaring Men belonging to any of Our Ships of War, and
absenting themselves from the same, as aforesaid, that they, and every of them,
do forthwith upon the Publishing of this Our Proclamation, repair on Board such
of Our respective Ships or Vessels unto which they do belong, upon Pain of
their being Punished as Deserters; Hereby Declaring, That as We are very
desirous of giving all due Encouragement to such Seamen and Mariners employed
in Our Service, as shall be found doing their Duty in their several Stations
and Employments; So We are Resolved to Proceed with the utmost Severity of Law
against all such as shall neglect to give Obedience to this Our Proclamation.
And We do hereby Command all Captains, Commanders, and other Officers of Our
Ships whom it may concern, to make diligent Search on Board all Merchant Ships,
for any such Seamen who do or shall absent themselves from Our Service, and
upon finding them, to take them from on Board such Merchant Ships, and Secure
them, in order to their being brought to Condign Punishment.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the Twentieth Day of November, 1690. In the
Second Year of Our Reign.
God save King William and Queen Mary.
